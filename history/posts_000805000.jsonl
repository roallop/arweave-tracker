The would be upstarts were trying to stay ahead. Both were wary of a rising hoarde of electricity and light.\n\nThe old guard began with mergers of grand dame media. They were a titans in the age of print and copper wire toll bridges.\n\nTime merged with Warner Communications in 1990 for 14+B USD. Time Inc., a 1920s magazine startup, dominated print. Its internal zoning system for deliveries inspired the rise of postal zip codes, the indexing of the real world.  \n  \n Warner was a troubled 1970s parking lot business that mutated into media, publishing, talent agencies, film, music, video, cable - home of Superman and MTV.\n\nThe younger upstarts, walled electronic cities, were worried too.\n\nPeople brought their bicycles of the mind to enjoy the sights and sounds of a managed miniverses, manicured walled gardens.  \n  \n In Virginia was QuantumLink. There were others like Compuserve.\n\nPlayNET of Troy, NY licensed software to Quantum Computer Services, a struggling music on demand startup that pivoted into a failing video game business, and then into America Online.\n\nIt became the strongest of a handful of contenders. They knew their walls were useless as a sprawl of photons and electrons would consume them too.\n\nBoth old and new media kingdoms wanted to survive the rise of the Internet. They buried their vulnerabilities with the promise of becoming an epicenter of all media, old and new. The advisors said they could melt their advantages into one spearhead of 'synergies'.\n\nAttack surfaces hidden behind a single point of success failed.\n\nThe sprawl, of electrons and photons, swallowed them. \n  \n The empire failed, the pieces of AOL Time Warner were sold for scrap value. \n \n\n**2877 EARTH, THE NECKLACE, MARS CONSULATE**\n\nI went back to the secure room.

Anything useful from tracking my visitor?”\n\n\"Commander, we have nothing useful from tracking the visitor, how do you want to rank these samples?\"\n\n\"We want samples that are different from what Earth's oracles and 'chains have. I need data unavailable to grey market co-ops, grey marketeers for Earth, even if they stole it or used local brokers.\n\nThese co-ops are like the ones back home. They made a lot of money during the Long War as grey market operators. That's done.\n\nThey're all rushing to survive, adapting in different ways. Some will shrink, some will fold, and some will become darker co-ops.\n\nWe're making \"bait\" for the last kind of business, black market.\"\n\n\"Commander, the Inspector is connecting.\"\n\n\"Connect.\"\n\nThe Inspector's image joined the data streams in the room.\n\n\"Commander, I saw you had a visitor, I thought she was still in the hospital. I had my feeds on, as a precaution. I can send your bait as soon as its ready. They have middlemen, one we turned.”\n\n“I need police 'oracles, to screen out data this co-op could steal. The best draw is something you want so bad and can't get from anyone or anywhere else, not even the authorities.\n\n\"Your visitor is proof, we can't lure out the head.

It's coordinated through a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) made up of artists and developers along with some of their fans and enablers. Our projects are designed as web3 experiments in sustainable, systemic change.\n\n**Our Work:**\n\n1. We develop NFT artists and build communities of collectors and fans around them, both virtually and IRL\n2. We support members who host local Good Work House gatherings\n3. We produce our own social impact-driven NFT projects\n4. We support impact-driven artists by collecting their art\n\n**Core Values:**\n\nAs we leverage the power of art for social good, we create opportunities for people to find belonging as we gather around artists. Our motto is Serving Connection. We create opportunities for people to make meaningful connections with others through acts of service, which are what Good Work House projects are. We believe that a connection around shared service is the most resilient way to build community. More than just shared values, the act of serving together creates a unique bond.\n\nOur 3 Equations:\n\n* We > Me\n* Collaboration > Competition\n* People > Things\n\n**Promoting Access:**\n\n\"We rise by lifting others.\" - Robert Ingersoll\n\nThe blockchain has created a massive new market for art, in the form of NFTs. We leverage our access and experience to on-board others, particularly those who struggle with access in the mainstream market economy.\n\n**Decentralizing:**\n\nNew organizations are started by small teams. Though we, too, started with a small group, we are committed to operating as a decentralized organization and are already behaving in a manner that anticipates continued progressive decentralization.\n\n**Why a DAO?**\n\nThe system is broken. Corporations are too powerful and too much of that power is controlled by too few at the top. This has led to a massive wealth gap, with too many people living in a constant state of financial struggle. DAOs offer a new alternative that offers greater fairness and equity, by distributing power more evenly, especially to artists who are too often undervalued.\n\n**Our Genesis Season Project: Groundbreaking**\n\nOur first project as a DAO is \"[Groundbreaking](https://goodwork.house/groundbreaking)\"—a collection of art from 12 Haitian artists. During the course of 8 weeks, our mentors will work with these artists to help them launch their NFT careers through a series of auction events held both IRL in Venice, CA and virtually.\n\nThe project introduces a system of change, where 10% of the proceeds go directly to a multi-sig wallet governed by the 12 Haitian artists to fund their ongoing efforts to on-boarding more Haitian artists, after their residency with Good Work House in finished. 50% of the proceeds go directly to the artists and 40% to the Good Work DAO to fund its operations developing and promoting artists and collecting art from impact-driven artists.", "timestamp": 1636146011, "digest": "0Rc0vosqCBOLprOiKPzkT3_34c1-QG9LMChvZWHah3k", "contributor": "0xfA94DC0fEa434aD428e80EC7CF66E0DC56327FE2"}

Dajemy na nim **samo mięso**. Otrzymasz wszystko, co jest potrzebne, aby samemu przeprowadzać testy penetracyjne i analizy pod kątem bezpieczeństwa swojej sieci i maszyn w niej się znajdujących — zgodnie z naszą zasadą: “minimum teorii, maksimum praktyki”.\n\nWprowadzenie w świat pentestów, exploitów i narzędzi oraz moduł formalno-prawny, który może się przydać przy realizacji takich usług (lub ich zamawianiu) załatwiamy pierwszego dnia do lunchu. A potem zaczyna się **prawdziwa jazda bez trzymanki!** Do końca trzeciego dnia uczestnicy pracują w naszym labie, **symulującym prawdziwą sieć firmową**.\\\nZadaniem uczestnika jest **wykonanie testu penetracyjnego krok po kroku** i zakończenie szkolenia ze zrootowanymi wszystkimi hostami (poprzez różne techniki i metody ataku), czyli posiadanie uprawnień administracyjnych i totalnej kontroli nad całym środowiskiem :) Ale to nie koniec — trzeba jeszcze (jak w życiu!) omijać pułapki zastawione przez administratora atakowanej sieci, a czasem zmodyfikować exploita, aby zadziałał (bez obaw, pokażemy jakie to czasem proste).\n\nTo szkolenie jest inne niż reszta szkoleń sieciowych/bezpieczeństwa na jakich byłeś. Na czas każdego labu otrzymasz narzędzia i instrukcje wyznaczające kierunek postępowania, ale nie dokładnie polecenia do bezmyślnego przeklejenia. Będziesz musiał sam zastanowić się i pokombinować. Nie martw się, jeśli się “zawiesisz”. Na koniec każdego labu wspólnie przechodzimy przez rozwiązania i cały czas trener jest do dyspozycji.\n\nMocno stawiamy na realizm, a szkolenie prowadzą wspólnie Krzysztof Nowak i Piotr Konieczny, którzy od lat na zlecenie największych polskich i zagranicznych spółek wykonują testym penetracyjne i w trakcie szkolenia dzielą się historiami i problemami, które zdarzyły się naprawdę, a o których podręczniki do “hackingu” milczą.\n\nTo szkolenie nauczy Cię technik penetracji, z których korzystają prawdziwi włamywacze, dzięki czemu będziesz wiedział jak i gdzie szukać śladów włamania oraz co zrobić, aby poprawnie zabezpieczyć swoją infrastrukturę przed atakami. Realizujemy je regularnie od ponad 8 lat i do tej pory przeszkoliliśmy ponad 3000 **adminów, devopsów, ptesterów **a nawet **programistów**, którzy chcieli “wiedzieć więcej”.\\\nI moglibyśmy tak opisywać to szkolenie jeszcze długo, bo jesteśmy bardzo wkręceni w ten temat, ale oddajmy na chwilę głos uczestnikom ostatnich terminów — oto, co napisali w ankietach poszkoleniowych:\n\n> Bardzo dobre szkolenie i mnóstwo dodatkowych materiałów, które spokojnie można czytać przez kolejne trzy miesiące ;)\n\n> Zdecydowanie polecam (…) przystępna forma prowadzenia całości sprawia, że przez całe 3 dni człowiek się nie nudzi a ilość wiedzy jest jednocześnie obszerna i przyswajalna. Zdecydowanie podnosi świadomość w temacie bezpieczeństwa sieci.\n\n> Mocne nastawienie na praktykę. Dobrze się słucha ludzi, którzy znają się na tym o czym mówią.\n\n> Szkolenie bardzo profesjonalnie prowadzone. Trenerzy świetnie przygotowani, będący jednocześnie praktykami w przekazywanej wiedzy. Informacje przekazane w sposób zrozumiały dla każdego i dający wiele satysfakcji (zdobywanie kolejnych maszyn)\n\n> Moja wiedza uległa dużemu zwiększeniu, dowiedziałem się jak naprawdę zabrać się do testów penetracyjnych. Dużo praktyki.

Nie tracimy czasu na mało istotne kwestie teoretyczne typu “czym jest OSINT?”. Od razu przechodzimy do praktyki ucząc konkretnych technik służących do zdobywania informacji na temat “celu” (osoby lub firmy) z setek publicznych i niepublicznych źródeł. Pokazujemy też dziesiątki narzędzi, z których można skorzystać aby sobie te poszukiwania (i późniejszą analizę danych) ułatwić.\n\nSzkolenie jest idealne nie tylko dla prywatnych detektywów czy analityków pracujących w organach ścigania, służbach specjalnych lub prokuraturze. Ta wiedza przyda się każdemu kogo praca polega na wyszukiwaniu informacji, czyli headhunterom/rekruterom, ubezpieczycielom, prawnikom i dziennikarzom lub komornikom a także miłośnikom prywatności, aby wiedzieli jakich błędów nie popełniać korzystając z internetu, czy kupując dom.\n\nTechniki i narzędzia wykorzystywane do OSINT-u często znikają tak szybko jak się rodzą, dlatego warto mieć grupę “wsparcia”, w której stale można aktualizować swoją wiedzę. Stąd też, po tym szkoleniu wychodzisz od nas nie tylko z potężną dawką wiedzy, ale również z dostępem do zamkniętej grupy absolwentów, w ramach której można wspólnie poruszać tematy związane z OSINT-em i pomagać sobie wzajemnie z analizą/ustalaniem informacji.\n\n**Wrocław**: **15 listopada 2021**r. — zostało **5 wolnych miejsc**\\\nOstatnio ktoś zarejestrował się 05 listopada 2021r. → [zarejestruj się na to szkolenie](https://niebezpiecznik.pl/szkolenia/rejestracja/?sz=syg2pd)\n\n*   1299 PLN netto (do 12 listopada)\n*   \\\n\n*   1499 PLN netto (od 13 listopada)\n\n**ZDALNIE**: **23 listopada 2021**r. — **UWAGA**: zostały **tylko 2 wolne miejsca**\\\nOstatnio ktoś zarejestrował się 04 listopada 2021r. → [zarejestruj się na to szkolenie](https://niebezpiecznik.pl/szkolenia/rejestracja/?sz=syfybk)\n\n*   1199 PLN netto (do 12 listopada)\n*   \\\n\n*   1399 PLN netto (od 13 listopada)\n\n**Warszawa**: **30 listopada 2021**r. — zostało **5 wolnych miejsc**\\\nOstatnio ktoś zarejestrował się 05 listopada 2021r. → [zarejestruj się na to szkolenie](https://niebezpiecznik.pl/szkolenia/rejestracja/?sz=syg2it)\n\n*   1299 PLN netto (do 12 listopada)\n*   \\\n\n*   1499 PLN netto (od 13 listopada)\n\n**Kraków**: **07 grudnia 2021**r. — zostało **8 wolnych miejsc**\\\nOstatnio ktoś zarejestrował się 05 listopada 2021r. → [zarejestruj się na to szkolenie](https://niebezpiecznik.pl/szkolenia/rejestracja/?sz=syg265)\n\n*   1299 PLN netto (do 19 listopada)\n*   \\\n\n*   1499 PLN netto (od 20 listopada)\n\n**ZDALNIE**: **13 grudnia 2021**r. — zostało **9 wolnych miejsc**\\\nOstatnio ktoś zarejestrował się 05 listopada 2021r. → [zarejestruj się na to szkolenie](https://niebezpiecznik.pl/szkolenia/rejestracja/?sz=syfyez)\n\n*   1199 PLN netto (do 19 listopada)\n*   \\\n\n*   1399 PLN netto (od 20 listopada)\n\n### Pozostałe szkolenia stacjonarne i te “dla każdego”\n\nPowyżej przedstawiliśmy opisy i terminy naszych **3 najpopularniejszych szkoleń z bezpieczeństwa**.

Fortune favors the bold, as does the metaverse, so any brand looking to make a big first or next splash should consult this article as a roadmap for consideration.\n\n## Incubating Your Brand DAO\n\nAs Web3 rolls out new approaches to ownership and expression, brands are well-positioned to offer opportunities for their fans and loyal customers to own and express a piece of the pie, with a DAO serving as the ideal vehicle. As is known, DAOs are incredible for aligning value between stakeholders and having fun together, playgrounds rife for brands to experiment with.\n\nTo kick off, DAOs need a few things to get started: seed capital, membership, and a raison d'être. Thankfully, brands often have plenty of money and cohorts of loyal customers who want more. The last piece is the key differentiator that can elevate both the brand and the DAO above their competition.\n\nSome DAOs collect NFTs, some run a members-only index fund, and others create public goods for their ecosystem. Brands have some interesting options at hand given their baked-in resources, so some suggestions:\n\n* Develop fresh IP within the DAO\n* Launching a product line in partnership with the DAO\n* Rolling out an event series for DAO members to co-host\n\n### Fresh Intellectual Property (IP)\n\nBrands often have in-house creative teams or trusted agencies, but they often struggle to identify market trends ahead of time and to offer creativity that meets the moment. By leveraging the communal self-interest of the DAO’s membership, brands can work with the members to conduct ground-level market research from true fans who believe in the brand, whether through directly surveying them or lining them up as “citizen-investigators” to report on desired cohorts from the regular lives.\n\nMedia brands would slaver over the chance to predict the hot new movie or develop the next Spongebob or Peppa Pig, rather than responding to the trends as or after they happen. The members of the DAO would be powerfully incentivized to offer genuine insights and help to brainstorm the best applications for deploying and promoting the new intellectual property in circles the brand might never be able to access.\n\nWhatever format the IP takes, the brand should take care to offer some share monetization for the co-creators in the DAO, whether ranked by effort of contribution or utilization of ideas, and offer unique access to the IP (or something tangential, like an awards night afterparty) to all DAO members.\n\nImagine how crowded it’ll be onstage when the DAO’s leading producer-members are jumping onstage to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\n### New product lines\n\nFor brands that deal in more physical goods, building a DAO to design and promote new product lines would be hugely beneficial.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club occasionally offers its members access to exclusive merchandise so they can celebrate their membership together. In August, the [club collaborated](https://twitter.com/BoredApeYC/status/1428800327789301772) with streetwear brand The Hundreds for a 3-hour drop available only to ape holders.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/39GVx2c2WnXYtuVvDrSoM.png?height=928&width=1638)\n\nThe Hundreds went on to launch its own avatar series, [Adam Bomb Squad](https://abs.thehundreds.com/), which promised access to exclusive merchandise, drops, and fast lanes for certain sales. Further, it offers bomb holders the ability to profit from the sale of merchandise featuring their specific bomb avatar.\n\nThe ABS model is a paragon for how brands can experiment with Web3 communities and tie them up into their business operations.\n\nWhether it’s a line of T-shirts, sustainable cookware, or a run on small batch rum, brands can work with a community on the strategy and execution for launching and selling products, then split the proceeds with the members according to the compact they strike.\n\nDiageo’s next nine-figure acquisition? Watch out, George Clooney tequila.\n\n### Event series\n\nPlenty of brands own and participate in events, either directly or through partnerships, and approaching a new event series with a DAO could identify a new market with a built-in marketing team predisposed to see it succeed.\n\nThe brand’s team and the DAO members can cooperatively brainstorm on the purpose, content, scope, and budgets for the event series, whether virtual or physical, and DAO members can take on responsibilities and leadership on execution in return for greater stakes in the DAO’s value pool.\n\nRather than hiring a team of short-sighted brand ambassadors who are simply counting the minutes until time to clock out, the brand can utilize DAO members as authentic hype personnel to ensure the event is running smoothly and participants are enjoying the experiences provided. Given their stake in the success of the event, DAO members’ enthusiasm will come across genuine to guests, rather than manufactured for a paycheck.\n\nAnd having the DAO spread around the world geographically, it’ll be much easier for the brand to leverage local expertise in choosing where to site physical events and which vendors and partners to bring onboard, much preferable to carting larger teams around the world and starting from scratch for any new locale.\n\n## Hatching the DAO From Inside Your Brand\n\nThere a number of ways to start a DAO and the brand should carefully consider the best process for launching it, including and beyond the legal and compliance concerns.\n\nThere are some good models to examine from the social token space that can aid brand teams in building and executing the right strategy for their needs. The lowest-risk model would be to simply give away tokens to customers based on their past interactions with the brand, from purchases and email signups to friendly tweets and customer survey completions. This approach was pioneered by musician RAC, who gave out his branded social token to his existing fanbase and created exclusive benefits for token holders.\n\nAnother approach is to create an application process where prospective DAO members offer their qualifications, talents, and interest level for scrutiny and approval. This method could be really valuable for growing the membership down the road and tasking a recruitment committee of DAO members to oversee this process, truly decentralizing the control.\n\nBrands could simply offer a free signup form where anyone who signs up can receive an allotment of tokens and membership in the DAO. This would be great for generating a large membership, however it’s likely to attract free riders who simply want to immediately flip the tokens for profit and more passive fans of the brand who don’t have the capacity or skillset to meaningfully contribute to the DAO’s success. As any organizational expert will proffer, starting smaller is often better for outcomes.\n\nAs observed in recent NFT avatar sales, brands could similarly employ a whitelisting lottery in which potential members must validate themselves (usually by connecting a wallet) and enter for a chance to receive tokens and participate. This can be great for building hype and controlling the size of the DAO, but doesn’t perfectly eliminate the free rider or passive participant problems.\n\nHowever, some avatar communities broke up their initial sales into a presale and open sale, where interested buyers needed to enter a whitelisting lottery to participate in the presales, significantly driving the hype upward before the open sale. Brands could employ a pre-offering on a whitelisted lottery system to drive similar hype and then open the process up to a different selection mechanism later.\n\nIf the brand believes the DAO will create significant value for participants and/or also wants to raise some capital, it could try selling a branded token for access to the DAO or ask members to contribute capital to a pool for a reciprocal stake in the voting processes. This would be incredibly risky for any brand to try and would open up a ton of liability since this is offering a security and asking fans to pay up first before they see the goods. Lawsuits and reputation damage are definitely on the table with this approach.\n\nBrands typically have plenty of capital, so they should be comfortable with the necessary outlays to launch and kickstart this kind of project.\n\nHowever, there’s endless room for creatively seeding the DAO with awesome people and brands know their audiences better than most, so the approach need not be cookie-cutter. Web3 often rewards creative risk-taking and brands should be comfortable taking a chance on wowing their fans, the wider Web3 community, and – of course – their competitors.\n\n## Raising Your Brand DAO Correctly\n\nNo matter the purpose or launching method, any brand interested in a DAO needs to seriously self-reflect before diving in, as Web3 is a messy, complicated, risky, and incredibly fun space to play in.\n\nOn the legal front, the brand needs to understand the degree of risk it’s taking on and how that could affect the rest of the rest of the business. Carefully assessing the compliance risk upfront can be a bit annoying and costly, but it’s much cheaper and less painful than ending up in a courtroom like Telegram or duking it out with the SEC like Ripple.\n\nThe ground around DAOs is still largely untested legally, so the brands should prepare a rainy day plan in case of litigation.\n\nCommunity management is a big deal, particularly when the community members have real stakes in the outcomes. Managing Instagram comments will no longer suffice; the community management team will need to preemptively familiarize itself with Discord and DAO tools like Snapshot and Gnosis Safe. It will need to be well-versed in multisig wallets, best practices on DAO voting, and wallet FAQs and be prepared to onboard some Web3 first-timers who want a new way to interact with the brand and be rewarded.\n\nFurther, the community management team needs to be trained in mobilizing membership, in getting out the vote political campaign-style because low voting turnout is often the bane of any DAO-based endeavor.\n\nThe brand should also understand it is putting its reputation on the line. Pulling this off incorrectly could not only alienate Web3 folks, but it could also damage its relationship with the established fanbase. Nonetheless, if the brand is successful in this DAO experiment, it could usher in an entirely new golden era for the brand and help pioneer the future of exchanging value.\n\nAnd what about the financial outcomes? Is the brand comfortable sharing revenue with an outside group? How will tokens factor into GAAP accounting and affect taxes and the balance sheet? Tricky questions most CFOs will not be prepared to answer, but there is a growing class of Web3 compliance, legal, and accounting teams that have been serving Web3 startups well and would love to help shepherd a brand into the metaverse.\n\nFundamentally, the brand needs to grapple with a few core quandaries. It has capital and reach, but does it want the greater depth that Web3 mechanics can offer? And is it comfortable with trading off some control in exchange for the loyalty upside? Decentralization is a big step for any organization and the brand must establish a long-term plan for how and what it wants to decentralize, then make it public in any DAO proceedings.\n\nLaunching a DAO carries some risk and a good deal of uncertainty, but it’s a fun idea with tremendous financial and reputational upside – it’s going to happen eventually. So why not take a chance and be the brave pioneer who sets the standard for everyone else?", "timestamp": 1636146798, "digest": "pQrzhpeb8FKBKfamWIQCw1u2sVXuYfctQOef9zHXCE0", "contributor": "0xC88563855A54b4A735137Cc7d6926B28fA778C0e"}

By leveraging the communal self-interest of the DAO’s membership, brands can work with the members to conduct ground-level market research from true fans who believe in the brand, whether through directly surveying them or lining them up as “citizen-investigators” to report on desired cohorts from the regular lives.\n\nMedia brands would slaver over the chance to predict the hot new movie or develop the next Spongebob or Peppa Pig, rather than responding to the trends as or after they happen. The members of the DAO would be powerfully incentivized to offer genuine insights and help to brainstorm the best applications for deploying and promoting the new intellectual property in circles the brand might never be able to access.\n\nWhatever format the IP takes, the brand should take care to offer some share monetization for the co-creators in the DAO, whether ranked by effort of contribution or utilization of ideas, and offer unique access to the IP (or something tangential, like an awards night afterparty) to all DAO members.\n\nImagine how crowded it’ll be onstage when the DAO’s leading producer-members are jumping onstage to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\n### New product lines\n\nFor brands that deal in more physical goods, building a DAO to design and promote new product lines would be hugely beneficial.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club occasionally offers its members access to exclusive merchandise so they can celebrate their membership together. In August, the [club collaborated](https://twitter.com/BoredApeYC/status/1428800327789301772) with streetwear brand The Hundreds for a 3-hour drop available only to ape holders.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/39GVx2c2WnXYtuVvDrSoM.png?height=928&width=1638)\n\nThe Hundreds went on to launch its own avatar series, [Adam Bomb Squad](https://abs.thehundreds.com/), which promised access to exclusive merchandise, drops, and fast lanes for certain sales. Further, it offers bomb holders the ability to profit from the sale of merchandise featuring their specific bomb avatar.\n\nThe ABS model is a paragon for how brands can experiment with Web3 communities and tie them up into their business operations.\n\nWhether it’s a line of T-shirts, sustainable cookware, or a run on small batch rum, brands can work with a community on the strategy and execution for launching and selling products, then split the proceeds with the members according to the compact they strike.\n\nDiageo’s next nine-figure acquisition? Watch out, George Clooney tequila.\n\n### Event series\n\nPlenty of brands own and participate in events, either directly or through partnerships, and approaching a new event series with a DAO could identify a new market with a built-in marketing team predisposed to see it succeed.\n\nThe brand’s team and the DAO members can cooperatively brainstorm on the purpose, content, scope, and budgets for the event series, whether virtual or physical, and DAO members can take on responsibilities and leadership on execution in return for greater stakes in the DAO’s value pool.\n\nRather than hiring a team of short-sighted brand ambassadors who are simply counting the minutes until time to clock out, the brand can utilize DAO members as authentic hype personnel to ensure the event is running smoothly and participants are enjoying the experiences provided. Given their stake in the success of the event, DAO members’ enthusiasm will come across genuine to guests, rather than manufactured for a paycheck.\n\nAnd having the DAO spread around the world geographically, it’ll be much easier for the brand to leverage local expertise in choosing where to site physical events and which vendors and partners to bring onboard, much preferable to carting larger teams around the world and starting from scratch for any new locale.\n\n## Hatching the DAO From Inside Your Brand\n\nThere a number of ways to start a DAO and the brand should carefully consider the best process for launching it, including and beyond the legal and compliance concerns.\n\nThere are some good models to examine from the social token space that can aid brand teams in building and executing the right strategy for their needs. The lowest-risk model would be to simply give away tokens to customers based on their past interactions with the brand, from purchases and email signups to friendly tweets and customer survey completions. This approach was pioneered by musician RAC, who gave out his branded social token to his existing fanbase and created exclusive benefits for token holders.\n\nAnother approach is to create an application process where prospective DAO members offer their qualifications, talents, and interest level for scrutiny and approval. This method could be really valuable for growing the membership down the road and tasking a recruitment committee of DAO members to oversee this process, truly decentralizing the control.\n\nBrands could simply offer a free signup form where anyone who signs up can receive an allotment of tokens and membership in the DAO. This would be great for generating a large membership, however it’s likely to attract free riders who simply want to immediately flip the tokens for profit and more passive fans of the brand who don’t have the capacity or skillset to meaningfully contribute to the DAO’s success. As any organizational expert will proffer, starting smaller is often better for outcomes.\n\nAs observed in recent NFT avatar sales, brands could similarly employ a whitelisting lottery in which potential members must validate themselves (usually by connecting a wallet) and enter for a chance to receive tokens and participate. This can be great for building hype and controlling the size of the DAO, but doesn’t perfectly eliminate the free rider or passive participant problems.\n\nHowever, some avatar communities broke up their initial sales into a presale and open sale, where interested buyers needed to enter a whitelisting lottery to participate in the presales, significantly driving the hype upward before the open sale. Brands could employ a pre-offering on a whitelisted lottery system to drive similar hype and then open the process up to a different selection mechanism later.\n\nIf the brand believes the DAO will create significant value for participants and/or also wants to raise some capital, it could try selling a branded token for access to the DAO or ask members to contribute capital to a pool for a reciprocal stake in the voting processes. This would be incredibly risky for any brand to try and would open up a ton of liability since this is offering a security and asking fans to pay up first before they see the goods. Lawsuits and reputation damage are definitely on the table with this approach.\n\nBrands typically have plenty of capital, so they should be comfortable with the necessary outlays to launch and kickstart this kind of project.\n\nHowever, there’s endless room for creatively seeding the DAO with awesome people and brands know their audiences better than most, so the approach need not be cookie-cutter. Web3 often rewards creative risk-taking and brands should be comfortable taking a chance on wowing their fans, the wider Web3 community, and – of course – their competitors.\n\n## Raising Your Brand DAO Correctly\n\nNo matter the purpose or launching method, any brand interested in a DAO needs to seriously self-reflect before diving in, as Web3 is a messy, complicated, risky, and incredibly fun space to play in.\n\nOn the legal front, the brand needs to understand the degree of risk it’s taking on and how that could affect the rest of the rest of the business. Carefully assessing the compliance risk upfront can be a bit annoying and costly, but it’s much cheaper and less painful than ending up in a courtroom like Telegram or duking it out with the SEC like Ripple.\n\nThe ground around DAOs is still largely untested legally, so the brands should prepare a rainy day plan in case of litigation.\n\nCommunity management is a big deal, particularly when the community members have real stakes in the outcomes. Managing Instagram comments will no longer suffice; the community management team will need to preemptively familiarize itself with Discord and DAO tools like Snapshot and Gnosis Safe. It will need to be well-versed in multisig wallets, best practices on DAO voting, and wallet FAQs and be prepared to onboard some Web3 first-timers who want a new way to interact with the brand and be rewarded.\n\nFurther, the community management team needs to be trained in mobilizing membership, in getting out the vote political campaign-style because low voting turnout is often the bane of any DAO-based endeavor.\n\nThe brand should also understand it is putting its reputation on the line. Pulling this off incorrectly could not only alienate Web3 folks, but it could also damage its relationship with the established fanbase. Nonetheless, if the brand is successful in this DAO experiment, it could usher in an entirely new golden era for the brand and help pioneer the future of exchanging value.\n\nAnd what about the financial outcomes? Is the brand comfortable sharing revenue with an outside group? How will tokens factor into GAAP accounting and affect taxes and the balance sheet? Tricky questions most CFOs will not be prepared to answer, but there is a growing class of Web3 compliance, legal, and accounting teams that have been serving Web3 startups well and would love to help shepherd a brand into the metaverse.\n\nFundamentally, the brand needs to grapple with a few core quandaries. It has capital and reach, but does it want the greater depth that Web3 mechanics can offer? And is it comfortable with trading off some control in exchange for the loyalty upside? Decentralization is a big step for any organization and the brand must establish a long-term plan for how and what it wants to decentralize, then make it public in any DAO proceedings.\n\nLaunching a DAO carries some risk and a good deal of uncertainty, but it’s a fun idea with tremendous financial and reputational upside – it’s going to happen eventually. So why not take a chance and be the brave pioneer who sets the standard for everyone else?", "timestamp": 1636146798, "digest": "pQrzhpeb8FKBKfamWIQCw1u2sVXuYfctQOef9zHXCE0", "contributor": "0xC88563855A54b4A735137Cc7d6926B28fA778C0e"}

It does not happen automatically.\n\nPillboosts **must** be applied during minting.\nThey **cannot** be applied after your avatar has been minted.\n\n**What kind of pillboosts are there?**\n\nEach pillboost unlocks one of four things:\n\n1. **Wearables:** A wearable item such as a headpiece, breastplate, or cloak.\n2. **Traits:** Aspects, habits, behaviors and quirks of an avatar. These can produce aesthetic effects on the avatar’s base body such as a tattoo or marking. They also influence your avatar's attributes.\n3. **Factions:** Some pills - such as the Shadowpak pill - unlock faction membership.\n4. **Pets:** Frens! You can get pets now, and in future gameplay releases, you'll be able to level them up and customize their look, attributes and abilities.\n\n**What happens to my pill after I use it to boost my avatar?**\nAll pills that are used as pillboosts will be burned when your avatar is minted. If you do not use a pill to boost your avatar, nothing happens to it. It'll stay in your wallet untouched.\n\n**How many pillboosts can I apply to my avatar?**\nAn avatar can be boosted up to five times:\n\n1 **Origin Trait:** Where your avatar is from\n1 **Background Trait:** Your experiences growing up\n1 **Talent Trait:** A specific ability you have a talent for\n1 **Wearable:** A single wearable item\n1 **Pet:** A single pet.\n\nThe full list of pillboosts at launch is:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g4GUpqrAK5nm3ntP5C8O2.png?height=769&width=677)\n\n", "timestamp": 1636153846, "digest": "iBGGhmynmJaAU3I6WeLyMQ-5zpbv9LkhO-XT1Pd6vqw", "contributor": "0x0f1C01d98AE190Ad2739a6075B21C2343d8b412e"}

But on the bright side, you can resell it on OpenSea!\n\n**If I buy multiple blessings, can I win multiple portalpills?**\nNo. To maintain accessibility and broadly distribute portalpills to as many people as possible, an address can only ever win one portalpill.\n\n**When does the Blessing Pool start and end?**\nWe haven't announced the date yet. To be the first to know, keep an eye on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/pillsuniverse)\n\n\n---\n\n## I got a portalpill! What now?\n\n \n **Welcome to Chainspace!** \n Once you’ve gotten your portalpill, get ready for the launch of PZ-01. [Join the PILLS discord](https://www.discord.gg/pillsuniverse) and [keep an eye on Twitter for updates](https://www.twitter.com/pillsuniverse) and to be the first to learn of the release date.\n\n\n---\n\n## Pillboosts\n\nTo date, the PILLS project has released 15 pills of mixed edition sizes. Just over 1,600 pill NFTs have been minted in total.\n\nEach of these pills can redeem one portalpill.\nThey can also be used to unlock and apply rare “boosts” to your avatar.\n\n**How do pillboosts work?**\nThe avatar creation system checks your wallet for pills at the beginning of the creation process. It will then show you pillboosts you can select as you progress through each stage of the system.\n\nPillboosts must be explicitly selected by the player to be applied. It does not happen automatically.\n\nPillboosts **must** be applied during minting.\nThey **cannot** be applied after your avatar has been minted.\n\n**What kind of pillboosts are there?**\n\nEach pillboost unlocks one of four things:\n\n1. **Wearables:** A wearable item such as a headpiece, breastplate, or cloak.\n2. **Traits:** Aspects, habits, behaviors and quirks of an avatar. These can produce aesthetic effects on the avatar’s base body such as a tattoo or marking. They also influence your avatar's attributes.\n3. **Factions:** Some pills - such as the Shadowpak pill - unlock faction membership.\n4. **Pets:** Frens! You can get pets now, and in future gameplay releases, you'll be able to level them up and customize their look, attributes and abilities.\n\n**What happens to my pill after I use it to boost my avatar?**\nAll pills that are used as pillboosts will be burned when your avatar is minted. If you do not use a pill to boost your avatar, nothing happens to it. It'll stay in your wallet untouched.\n\n**How many pillboosts can I apply to my avatar?**\nAn avatar can be boosted up to five times:\n\n1 **Origin Trait:** Where your avatar is from\n1 **Background Trait:** Your experiences growing up\n1 **Talent Trait:** A specific ability you have a talent for\n1 **Wearable:** A single wearable item\n1 **Pet:** A single pet.\n\nThe full list of pillboosts at launch is:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g4GUpqrAK5nm3ntP5C8O2.png?height=769&width=677)\n\n", "timestamp": 1636153891, "digest": "iBGGhmynmJaAU3I6WeLyMQ-5zpbv9LkhO-XT1Pd6vqw", "contributor": "0x0f1C01d98AE190Ad2739a6075B21C2343d8b412e"}

{"id": "Y3zPpC-7u54fZ7d3d4l47wui1emHHO5QWRIpau9fVqA", "title": "Vote on Race Mechanics for Space Race #1 (November 9-12th)", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PpDQTWAuRoOYXa4LtWgr1.png?height=720&width=1058)\n\nLast week, we [published](https://superrare.mirror.xyz/CXrDKSCivTO_QzdgruW-CYJWDI90rRnONUhh8WK_nFQ) an update that governance for the SuperRare DAO is now beginning to reach the \"rubber-meets-road\" stage, along with the [minutes](https://www.notion.so/2021-10-28-SuperRare-DAO-Council-Meeting-Minutes-a914981d474d4a69ba746d3ad1db1d59) from the latest Governance Council meeting.\n\nAs detailed in those posts, after receiving 35 amazing submissions (!) we are now preparing to execute the first Space Race later this month. We were blown away by the extensive interest in becoming a Space Operator and the desire to participate in curation of the SuperRare Network.\n\nA first draft of the potential Space Race governance mechanics was [published](https://docs.superrare.com/) in August alongside the SuperRare 2.0 announcement - which also included the launch of the SuperRare DAO and $RARE governance token.\n\nSince then, things have evolved quite a bit: the first round of Space applications has been received and reviewed, the design and product dev cycle has reached full steam, and we've had hundreds of conversations with artists, collectors, curators, and community members about both Spaces themselves and how we can begin the work of decentralizing curation on SuperRare.\n\nGiven the additional time, information & user feedback collected since - the Council has been working with input from SuperRare Labs to draft a set of updated rules and procedures for SR#1. In the spirit of transparency and community agency, the Council - hoping to establish a set of improvements and updates that build upon the originally proposed model - is setting forth these mechanics for the community to review & ratify in advance of the first Space Race.\n\nWhile the goals and intent of the Space Race remain the same, we believe the following adjustments should create a better experience for both Space applicants and $RARE holders while we collectively learn how this product ought to be designed in order to achieve its full vision and potential. As a result, we are asking the community to certify the following voting framework for Space Race #1:\n\n* All 35 entrants will be included in the Space Race #1 racing slate, rather than a curated short-list, in recognition of the hard work from all participants to join in this inaugural race\n* There will be 5 winning spaces selected for admission in the first Space Race, rather than just a single winner\n* In the interest of ensuring scarcity while preserving flexibility, the Council is proposing an upper bound on the number of Spaces that can be added to the network in any month to a maximum of 10\n* Voting in the Space Race itself will remain open for 2 weeks, rather than 48hrs, to allow for better participation and engagement amongst the entire DAO\n* The race itself will be held using the Mirror [Token Race](https://dev.mirror.xyz/dLLIq4Iebg5DLWJbOWa3sU6oQuwbogkmqPnz-ZbzPUg) platform, rather than Snapshot, to better accommodate the desire for multiple winners, a longer racing window, more direct control over curation by $RARE token holders, and better support for social features\n\n**Read the full draft proposal → [here](https://www.notion.so/Establishing-Space-Race-Curation-Parameters-Governance-Methods-and-Procedures-e054fcc927fb4942a2f370a1f9d15415) ←**\n\nThese proposed changes were reached after thorough Council deliberation, and were decided to be in the best interests of the Network given the learnings gleaned over the last 3 months. While there is a balance to be struck between exhaustive deliberation and speedy action necessary to seize strategic opportunity - in the ethos of progressive decentralization, we believe the best ideas can emerge from anywhere and we must begin developing the muscles to allow for an optimal balance between analysis paralysis and swift action. Therefore, we've opened a [new section of the forum](https://forum.superrare.com/c/governace-voting/12) dedicated to discussion about SR#1 and Space Race governance generally, and welcome your feedback as we continue to iteratively design the Spaces product together as a community.\n\nStarting ***next Tuesday Nov 9th, and running for a 96 hour voting period though Nov 12th, we invite all members of the SuperRare DAO to vote in the forthcoming [Snapshot poll](https://www.notion.so/How-to-vote-on-Snapshot-e4a0c7caa0fe408cbe41191029572c35) to approve the described enhancements*** that we feel will make the Space Race a higher quality experience for all participants and stakeholders.\n\nWe look forward with great anticipation to this groundbreaking milestone that will admit the first community curated Spaces to SuperRare Network - beginning our journey toward decentralized curation for the world's leading CryptoArt marketplace and placing increasing control into the hands of our membership...onward!", "timestamp": 1636157878, "digest": "ryw4voztM03pUP7ihkGMmSfukZf-Zibq7N8y2RPwreE", "contributor": "0x05aeFAf679ea2E9b40F17580BAa34d32919B0734"}

Keep reading to find out how to get one.\n\n\n***\n\n## TL;DR\n\n* **There will be 22,000 portalpills available during this release.**\n* Portalpills act as an Access Key to participate in *PILLS Early Access*.\n* Each portalpill can mint one avatar when PZ-01 launches.\n* Acquiring a portalpill is the only way to create an avatar and participate in this initial Early Access phase of the PILLS project.\n* There are three ways to get one: **Redeeming** one by holding an existing pill, a **Dynamic Dutch Auction** and a **Raffle**.\n* Winners in the Dynamic Dutch Auction will receive a special \"EGODETH portalpill\" that will unlock rare traits for their avatar. These traits are critical to advancing the primary quest arc, and will make your avatar visually distinct (\"looks rare\"). If you want to flex, consider this option.\n* **PZ-01 will launch this year. The exact date will be determined after all portalpills are distributed.**\n\n\n***\n\n### How can I get a portalpill?\n\nPortalpills can be acquired in one of three methods. Each method will launch sequentially, one after the other:\n\n**Summoning Circle** Join the circle of existing pillholders and embrace the Queen Memfruit. She will reward you by summoning one SYNTH portalpill for every pill NFT in your wallet. Summoning is free, minus gas costs.\n\n**Egodeth Auction**The Queen Memfruit will distribute rare EGODETH portalpills to those that value them via a Dynamic Dutch Auction. These special portalpills apply rare traits to your avatar that produce distinctive visual effects that can never be acquired through regular gameplay.\n\n**Blessing Pool** Finally, the Memfruit Queen will randomly distribute SYNTH portalpills to those who acquire her blessings. Purchase more blessings to increase your chances of winning.\n\n\n***\n\n### What's the best method for me?\n\n**Want to guarantee yourself a portalpill?** Acquire an existing pill off [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/pills). Each pill we've released so far can be used to redeem one portalpill. **Before buying a pill, use the [Pill Checker](https://www.pills.forsale/#pillchecker) to check whether it has already been used to redeem a portalpill.**\n\n**Pro:** You are guaranteed a portalpill **Con:** Buying a pill on the secondary market costs more than the Blessing Pool raffle, the only other way to get a SYNTH portalpill.\n\n**Want to flex with an avatar that stands out with rare traits, distinctive art and that can play a key role in the primary quest arc?** Try to acquire an EGODETH portalpill in the Dynamic Dutch Auction.\n\n**Pro:** A visually distinct avatar with rare traits **Con:** Costs more than the other options\n\n**Want a portalpill at an accessible price?** The \"Blessing Pool\" raffle will randomly distribute the majority of the available portalpills, and is priced to maximize accessibility. More portalpills will be released through the raffle than all other distribution events combined.\n\n**Pro:** Affordable **Con:** No guarantee you'll get a portalpill\n\n\n***\n\n### What is the difference between a SYNTH portalpill and EGODETH portalpill?\n\nSYNTH are common portalpills. EGODETH are rare portalpills. Both enable you to travel to Chainspace, mint an avatar and access PZ-01.\n\nThe EGODETH portalpills unlock visually distinctive, rare avatar traits. These traits will only ever be accessible to avatars minted with an EGODETH portalpill, and the auction is the only way to ever get an EGODETH portalpill.\n\n![Screenshots of the two types of portalpills available.](https://pills.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FyfBTrz__wWxHVWNOMzkv4.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\nScreenshots of the two types of portalpills available.\n\n\n***\n\n## Getting a portalpill\n\n![](https://pills.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FinIMFzm5fRyPN6kl-aKNw.png&w=1920&q=90)\n\n## The Summoning Circle\n\n**TL;DR How do I participate in the Summoning Circle?**\n\n1. Search the [PILLS collection on OpenSea](https://www.opensea.io/collection/pills) for a pill you want.\n2. Check to make sure it has not already been used to summon a portalpill. You can do this by using the [Pill Checker](https://www.pills.forsale/#pillchecker).\n3. Once you've purchased a pill, go [to the Portalpill site](https://portalpill.pills.game/) and follow the prompts to the Summon Circle page.\n4. Follow the instructions on the Summon Circle page to summon your portalpill.\n\n**Can all pillholders get a portalpill?** Every pill we've released can be used to summon one portalpill.\n\n**Will I lose my pill after summoning a portalpill?** No. After being used to summon a portalpill, your pill(s) can still be used to \"pillboost\" your avatar with rare wearables, pets, traits or faction membership. [Learn more about pillboosts here.](http://https//)\n\n**What does it cost to summon a portalpill?** Summoning a portalpill is free, minus gas costs.\n\n**Do I have to summon my portalpill before a certain date?** No. The summoning window is open indefinitely.\n\n**Is there a limit to how many portalpills I can summon?** No. You can summon a portalpill for every eligible pill you hold - whether that's 3, or 30.\n\n**I want to buy a pill to summon a portalpill. How can I check if its eligible?** Copy/paste the OpenSea link of the pill you're looking at [into the Pill Checker](https://pills.forsale/#pillchecker).\n\n**What can I do with my pill once it has been used to summon a portalpill?** You can use it to \"pillboost\" your avatar when you mint it.\n\n**What's a Pillboost?** Every pill we've ever released has a \"pillboost\" effect you can choose to apply to your avatar. Each pillboost is different, depending on the pill or pills you hold. They might grant your avatar rare wearables, faction membership, special traits, or pets. **Learn more about pillboosts at the end of this post**\n\n**I purchased a pill off OpenSea without checking its redemption status. Now I discovered it has been used already. I want my money back!** Sorry, fren, but this is on you. Fortunately, all pills grant \"pillboosts\" to avatars, and with only 1600 or so pills in circulation, and 22,000 portalpills available, their value will be high, so reselling them will not be hard.\n\n**I have an EGODETH pill (e.g. EGODETH Unipill) does that mean I get an EGODETH portalpill?** No. EGODETH versions of existing pills give you a more powerful pillboost to use on your avatar. The only way to get an EGODETH Portalpill is via the Dynamic Dutch Auction.\n\n\n***\n\n![](https://pills.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FKJXpdOQ8CLMimQtJDeWwz.png&w=1920&q=90)\n\n## The EGODETH Auction\n\n**TL;DR How do I participate in the EGODETH Auction?**\n\n1. Once the auction is open, go to [the Portalpill site](https://https//portalpill.pills.game) and follow the prompts to the EGODETH Auction page.\n2. Submit the amount of ETH you wish to bid.\n3. The indicator shows you the likelihood that your bid will successfully get you a portalpill. This is an approximation.\n4. Submit your bid to be eligible. The higher your bid, the better your chances.\n5. If your bid is successful, you will receive a portalpill.\n6. If your bid is unsuccessful, you can withdraw your ETH.\n\n**What's a Dynamic Dutch Auction?** A variation on the standard Dutch Auction format. The system dynamically decides on the winning bid price at the end of the auction. Everyone who bid at the winning price or above it is then awarded an EGODETH portalpill.\n\n**How does the system dynamically determine the winning bid amount?** The Memfruit Queen has developed an algorithm that weighs several different variables. She keeps the exact algorithm a secret to avoid being gamed.\n\n**I submitted a bid, but need the ETH back** You can revoke your bid at any time to receive your ETH.\n\n\\*\\*How do I maximize my chances of winning?\\*\\*By bidding more, like in any auction. If in doubt, bid more.\n\n**How many EGODETH portalpills are available in the auction?** The total number is dynamic and dependent on how many bidders successfully bid at or above the winning bid price. It's even possible that a single bidder could employ a bid strategy that only creates a single EGODETH portalpill...\n\nTo guarantee a low total supply, a hardcap is in place. The exact number is being kept secret to avoid being gamed.\n\n**When will the auction open?** We'll announce the start and end times on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/pillsuniverse)\n\n**Why should I participate in the auction?** To get a rare EGODETH portalpill you can use to imbue your avatar with rare, visually distinctive traits. Avatars created from an EGODETH portalpill also play a key role in the primary quest arc, bringing them into the center of the story.\n\n**Is there another way to get EGODETH portalpills?** No. This auction is it. No more EGODETH portalpills will ever be created after this.\n\n\n***\n\n![](https://pills.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fyg11V-06XZJ9yd68usnFF.png&w=1920&q=90)\n\n## The Blessing Pool\n\n**TL;DR How do I participate in the Blessing Pool?**\n\n1. Once the Blessing Pool is open, [go to the Portalpill site](https://portalpill.pills.game) and follow the prompts to the Blessing pool page.\n2. Follow the instructions to purchase \"blessings\". Only one blessing is needed to be eligible.\n3. To increase your chances of winning, you can purchase multiple blessings. But only your first blessing is fully refundable. Every additional blessing is non-refundable.\n4. If you win a portalpill, the Blessing Pool keeps your ETH.\n5. If you do not win a portalpill, you can withdraw the ETH of your first blessing.\n6. **Note:** To prevent botting, The Blessing Pool is initially only open only to addresses that hold an NFT from whitelisted NFT projects.\n\n**Can you tell me more about this \"whitelist\"?** Bots are a persistent problem in NFT distribution. To mitigate botting and maximize access to PILLS, the first phase of the Blessing Pool will be available only to addresses that have held an NFT from a whitelisted project.\n\nIf there are still portalpills available at the end of this phase, a second phase will be run that's open to all addresses.\n\n**What NFT projects are included in the whitelist?** A comprehensive list along with the snapshot date will be published in a separate post prior to launch. This isn't to limit accessibility, expect the list to be fairly large.\n\n**How much does it cost?** Each \"blessing\" has a fixed price. The exact price will be announced closer to the launch of the Blessing Pool.\n\n**How many blessings should I buy?** That's up to you. Only one is necessary to be eligible in the raffle. Purchase more blessings to increase your chance of winning.\n\n**Won't whales just buy lots of blessings?** To dissuade whales, every blessing purchased **after** the first one will be non-refundable.\n\n**I didn't win a portalpill. What happens to the ETH I deposited?** Your first blessing is fully refundable. If you purchased more than one blessing, the ETH from those blessings is non-refundable and kept by the Blessing Pool.\n\n**I won a portalpill but don't want it. Can I just get my ETH back?** No, sorry. But on the bright side, you can resell it on OpenSea!\n\n**If I buy multiple blessings, can I win multiple portalpills?** No. To maintain accessibility and broadly distribute portalpills to as many people as possible, an address can only ever win one portalpill.\n\n**When does the Blessing Pool start and end?** We haven't announced the date yet. To be the first to know, keep an eye on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/pillsuniverse)\n\n\n***\n\n## I got a portalpill! What now?\n\n**Welcome to Chainspace!** Once you’ve gotten your portalpill, get ready for the launch of PZ-01. [Join the PILLS discord](https://www.discord.gg/pillsuniverse) and [keep an eye on Twitter for updates](https://www.twitter.com/pillsuniverse) and to be the first to learn of the release date.\n\n\n***\n\n## Pillboosts\n\nTo date, the PILLS project has released 15 pills of mixed edition sizes. Just over 1,600 pill NFTs have been minted in total.\n\nEach of these pills can redeem one portalpill. They can also be used to unlock and apply rare “boosts” to your avatar.\n\n**How do pillboosts work?** The avatar creation system checks your wallet for pills at the beginning of the creation process. It will then show you pillboosts you can select as you progress through each stage of the system.\n\nPillboosts must be explicitly selected by the player to be applied. It does not happen automatically.\n\nPillboosts **must** be applied during minting. They **cannot** be applied after your avatar has been minted.\n\n**What kind of pillboosts are there?**\n\nEach pillboost unlocks one of four things:\n\n1. **Wearables:** A wearable item such as a headpiece, breastplate, or cloak.\n2. **Traits:** Aspects, habits, behaviors and quirks of an avatar. These can produce aesthetic effects on the avatar’s base body such as a tattoo or marking. They also influence your avatar's attributes.\n3. **Factions:** Some pills - such as the Shadowpak pill - unlock faction membership.\n4. **Pets:** Frens! You can get pets now, and in future gameplay releases, you'll be able to level them up and customize their look, attributes and abilities.\n\n**What happens to my pill after I use it to boost my avatar?** All pills that are used as pillboosts will be burned when your avatar is minted.

世界中不可或缺的一环。\n\n**撰文：潘致雄**\n\n如果回忆一下初次进行的加密货币转账时的体验，特别是在确认收件人地址时，相信你可能会被这几个问题困扰过：这串像乱码一样的地址到底对不对？是需要一个一个字母校验准确性吗？字母大小写乱了要不要紧？漏了一个字母怎么办？如果转账错误可以回滚交易吗？\n\n而相比之下，我们使用的所有常规的互联网产品中，大多数时候只要确认一个简单的姓名、用户名、昵称、手机号或邮箱，就能放心的确认对方的身份或地址。\n\n就好像 **「用户体验」** 这件事一直都没提到加密货币世界的优先级中，如此普遍的需求竟然 10 年后仍旧没有解决。\n\n不过，好在已经有越来越多的初创团队开始探索这个领域了，他们的核心是提供「翻译」的服务，在 **「计算机语言」** 和 **「人类可读语言」** 之间进行互相的 **「无损」转译** 。\n\n这也是为什么现在给以太坊创始人 Vitalik Buterin 转账的时候不需要记录下他原始的以太坊账户地址 （0xd8dA...6045） ，而是只要记住「vitalik.eth」就行，后者就是一个典型的人类可读的用户名。\n\n其实以比特币和以太坊为首的区块链网络，由于账户底层采用了非对称加密技术，也就是常说的公私钥加密，所以这套系统天然就是对于计算机友好的，也就导致了人类的可读性相当不友好。\n\n为了解决这个问题，这些团队利用了区块链的智能合约功能，或者直接利用公链本身，构建一套「映射」和「翻译」系统，将用户常用的区块链原生的底层地址映射到人类可读的「用户名」，作为用户对外部世界公开的一个「身份」。\n\n目前在构建这类用户可读账户系统的底层协议中，有 **Ethereum Name Service** （ENS） 、 **FIO** 、 **DAS** 等几个项目，他们各有自己的特点：ENS 最流行、FIO 提供了更丰富的功能、DAS 的互操作性更出色。\n\n### 另一个场景：域名系统，即业务入口\n\n而除了账户系统之外，还有一个非常庞大的应用场景，就是 **「域名系统」** 。\n\n因为区块链网络不仅仅可以承载用户的资产，在智能合约的加持下还可以提供各类业务或服务，特别是互联网或金融类的业务，也有不少人将基于去中心化技术栈构建的互联网服务称为 **Web3** 。\n\n所以这些业务的服务入口，也就是 Web 2.0 中常用的「网站」形式，就可能会发生一些基础设施层面的根本性变化。\n\n简单来说，传统的 **Web 2.0 应用** ，主要是由 **「域名」** （比如 google.com） 和 **「服务器」** （比如托管在亚马逊的云服务） 组成。然后，通过传统的 **DNS** （域名服务） 体系，将域名和服务器所对应的「IP 地址」进行映射，这样普通用户也就可以通过「google.com」访问到谷歌的网站了。\n\n而到了 **Web3** 的世界中，为了将这两者去中心化，「服务器」提供的存储和计算能力就可以通过 **IPFS** 、 **以太坊** 、 **Dfinity** 等各种去中心化技术组合实现，而社区也寄希望于通过区块链网络将「域名」去中心化。\n\n最早的尝试的 **Namecoin** 已经是一个超过十年前的项目了，它通过分叉比特币的代码，创建出了一个以「.bit」结尾的顶级域名的区块链网络，希望更多下游应用集成他们，试图独立并颠覆现有的 DNS 体系。\n\n不过他们也碰到了自己的问题，毕竟项目的概念过于超前，所以直到 8 年后才出现几个同类的项目，比如 **Unstoppable Domains** 、 **Handshake** 等。另外，像 ENS 和 DAS 也是同样支持这类应用的，而且 ENS 也是目前最广泛使用的去中心化域名。\n\n### 横向对比\n\n在这些去中心化域名和账户系统的协议中，Namecoin 和 ENS 是其中最核心的两个。Namecoin 首次利用区块链进行域名的管理，而 ENS 在以太坊智能合约的加持下成为了一种全新的账户体系和去中心化应用协议栈的一部分。\n\n加上那些新型的协议，所有这些项目都可以分为两大核心场景： **专注于域名** 、 **专注于账户系统** ，也有些项目会同时支持两类场景。\n\n**「专注于域名」** 的项目用户场景更多是替代或补充现有的 DNS 体系，通过与 IPFS 等协议的集成，可以实现完全去中心化的前端网站的功能，所以他们更关注于与网页浏览器 （比如 Brave 或 Opera） 进行合作，提高用户体验。目前 ENS 和 Unstoppable Domains 是被浏览器集成最多的协议。\n\n**「专注于账户体系」** 的项目更多的是赋予用户使用该账户体系的场景，比如在去中心化应用 （DApp） 中直接集成，而且更需要关注于与加密货币钱包等入口级产品进行合作和集成，提高用户体验。目前也就 ENS 被广泛的集成在主流的加密货币钱包以及 DApp 中，而 FIO 声称获得了许多加密货币钱包的支持，但是实际的采用度上仍处于早期，社区关注度也下滑至几乎不可见。\n\n而另一个核心差别在于 **注册名称的所有权模式** ，有的是永久所有权 （但可能需要每年进行一次声明交易，支出网络交易费即可） ，而有的是租赁模式，需要按年支付一定的租赁费。\n\n可注册永久所有权的协议对用户而言更友好一些，相当于一次支付永久使用，而租赁模式对协议本身更友好，持续的收入可以用来进行协议的维护和功能迭代。\n\n除此之外，各个协议还有是否选择自建公链，具体的注册价格等多种维度的区别。\n\n![ENS 空投在即，为什么说去中心化域名及账户系统对 Web3 至关重要？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/e3d4d80e5e1bd0924e791ff539a4061a.jpg-article)\n\n### 始祖：Namecoin\n\nNamecoin 是比特币最早的 Fork 之一，甚至早于狗狗币，区块创世时间仅比比特币晚了 2 年 3 个月。其非匿名创始人 **Vincent Durham** 早已退休，协议已交由其他开发者维护。\n\n不过 Namecoin 可以算是一个失败的尝试了，目前疏于维护也没有具体的应用，所以对这段历史没有兴趣的话完全可以跳过这部分内容直接查看下一章。\n\n所以 Namecoin 很多参数直接参考了比特币，共 **2100 万** 个原生代币 NMC，但其代币最小单位 **「swartz」** 是为了纪念 RSS 协议和 Markdown 协议开发者、Reddit 联合创始人 **Aaron Swartz** ，他此前也在 [博客](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424134548/http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/squarezooko) 中描述过一种后来被 Namecoin 实现的方案 （Nakanames） 。\n\n与那些利用比特币代码再做类似的加密货币不同的是，Namecoin 是希望通过区块链技术来存储类似于 DNS 的记录，也就是将「.bit」与其他具体的 IP 地址、系统内地址的「映射关系」记录在 Namecoin 的区块链上。\n\n所以也可以将 Namecoin 区块链看作是一个维护「.bit」这个顶级域名记录的数据库。至于他们为什么选择「.bit」这个域名，可能是因为这个词代表了计算机领域中二进制的最小单位「比特」。\n\n而对于大多数的传统顶级域名 （比如最流行的「.com」） 来说，其实是由一家名叫 ICANN 的非营利机构专门负责管理和维护的，它全称为 Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers （互联网名称与数字地址分配机构） 。该机构成立于 1998 年，位于美国加州，除了管理和协调顶级域名之外，还负责管理全球 IP 地址的分配。\n\nNamecoin 目前还是独立于 ICANN 体系的，他们选择的「.bit」幸好还不是一个传统的顶级域名，所以未来还是存在兼容或者接入 ICANN 可能性的。\n\n不过相比中心化管理的 ICANN 而言，Namecoin 的特点还是非常明显的，和比特币一样，它的账本基于分布式存储，网络安全依赖算力，更重要的是它的域名注册过程抗审查，也无需许可。\n\n#### 用户场景：ZeroNet\n\nNamecoin 诞生的十年间，最重要的一个用户场景来自于它被「去中心化网络」 **ZeroNet** 集成，成为了该网络内的「域名」。\n\n使用起来也很简单，用户可以在注册 Namecoin 的域名时，将 ZeroNet 网络内的页面链接映射至某特定「.bit」域名中，然后其他用户就可以使用「xxxxx.bit」访问 ZeroNet 内的页面了。\n\n对于 Namecoin 而言，它只是存储了 bit 域名和第三方系统页面唯一标识符 （类似 IP） 的数据在 Namecoin 网络的区块链中，而第三方系统只需要运行 Namecoin 节点就可以获取所有这些关联关系。\n\n说起 ZeroNet 本身，其实也是一个比较极客和小众的项目，它采用了比特币的密码学技术和 BitTorrent 的 P2P 网络技术组建出一个去中心化的网络，在该网络内用户可以无需许可的创建网站或服务，网站内容也会被去中心化分布式存储，也可离线访问。用户只需运行一个 ZeroNet 的客户端就可以接入该网络。\n\nZeroNet 协议于 2015 年至 2019 年之间还在积极开发，但后来却疏于维护管理了。该协议未曾发行代币，且由于过于自由可能会被用在非法暗网等场景中，已被部分国家通过技术手段屏蔽。\n\n#### 如何接入现有基础设施？\n\nNamecoin 作为一个独立于 ICANN 体系的协议，目前还没有办法直接复用现有的互联网基础设施，特别是域名解析 （D NS） 的流程。\n\n对于传统域名而言，比如用户在访问「.com」域名时，会通过各级缓存或者 DNS 服务实现域名与 IP 地址的解析，这些已经是大多数设备的默认流程了，用户无需感知，拆开即用。\n\n但是对于 bit 域名的使用者而言，还需要运行特定的软件或者服务才可以实现，这部分会增加用户的上手门槛。\n\nNamecoin 区块链数据本身的安全性是由密码学保证的，所以用户需要先运行一个 Namecoin 的全节点，将所有域名的记录下载到本地。然后还需要运行一个官方的 NMControl 的工具，它类似于一个本地的 DNS 服务器，将会兼容和处理所有与互联网之间的连接。\n\n它还是可能会存在一些 **兼容性** 上的问题，比如它依赖 Python，所以在 Windows 系统的环境中有点不太友好。官方表示，「NMControl 拥有很好的兼容性，但并不完美。」\n\n但距离成为一款大众产品，它还有很多改进空间。\n\n### 行业标杆：Ethereum Name Service （ENS）\n\n毫不夸张的说，以太坊域名服务 （ENS） 已经逐渐演变成加密货币市场中 **影响力最大** 的账户体系和去中心化域名系统，虽然它仍旧是一个规模很小，用户体验非常初期的项目。\n\nENS 早期是一个由 **以太坊基金会** 孵化的项目，它基于以太坊的智能合约实现，所以不需要维护额外的区块链网络，甚至连货币体系也是复用了 ETH，最近才公开将发行协议代币。后来随着项目的完善并拥有了持续的现金流，已独立于以太坊基金会运作。\n\n相比较前辈 Namecoin，ENS 进一步拓展了用途，不仅局限在去中心化域名领域，而是间接地成为了一款具有社区共识的账户体系。\n\n除了很多 DeFi 以及 DApp 通过「.eth」域名部署去中心化的前端网站版本之外，很多加密社区的 KOL 将自己的 ENS 账户作为推特的名字，而且也有不少应用采用 ENS 的二级域名作为协议的账户系统。\n\n![ENS 空投在即，为什么说去中心化域名及账户系统对 Web3 至关重要？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/24790830e496db213bff41b06ba4e563.jpg-article)\n\n另外，ENS 的去中心化域名的解析能力也已经被集成在了几个加密货币友好的网页浏览器中，比如 **Brave** 和 **Opera** 等。\n\n另外 ENS 还提出了另一个神奇的解决方案，相比 Namecoin， **ENS 可以更方便地接入传统互联网的基础设施，兼容所有现有的浏览器** 。这个方案实现起来其实很简单，就是 ENS 团队购买了 eth.link 这个传统的域名，为所有访问 ENS 域名的用户提供解析服务。\n\n也就是说，用户只要在 ENS 域名后加上「.link」即可。举个例子，对于有原生解析能力的浏览器来说，访问「uniswap.eth」网址就可以进入 Uniswap 的去中心化版本的网站，而对于没有原生解析能力的浏览器来说 （比如 Safari 或者 Edge ），访问「uniswap.eth.link」也可以访问该网站，因为「eth.link」的持有者是 ENS 团队，他们可以决定其二级域名「uniswap.eth.link」访问到哪些资源。\n\n不过，eth.link 本身是否可访问可能会因国家或地区而异。而且这可能会带来一些 **中心化的风险** ，比如 eth.link 服务器或许会被攻击。所以 ENS 提供的这个服务是目前阶段下妥协了安全性和用户体验的一种解决方案，长期来看还是需要依赖以太坊区块链的全节点才能确保数据的绝对安全。\n\n#### 反向解析：账户体系初见成效\n\nENS 的反向解析功能在各个去中心化应用中的集成，意味着用户和应用都在将 ENS 看作是一种底层的账户体系。\n\n有必要先解释一下，对于以太坊的用户而言，通常是先创建一个 0x 开头的以太坊地址，作为用户的收款地址。然后才考虑注册一个 ENS 的名称，比如 vitalik.eth，将 vitalik.eth 映射到这个 0x 开头的以太坊地址，这种被称为正向解析。\n\n> **正向解析** ：vitalik.eth ———> 0xd8dA...6045\n\n而反向解析则是用户拿着 0x 的账户地址登录应用后，比如 Uniswap 的网站，用户就不会看到这串 0x 开头的地址，而是直接映射到了用户的 ENS 地址上。\n\n> **反向解析** ： 0xd8dA...6045 ———> vitalik.eth\n\n![ENS 空投在即，为什么说去中心化域名及账户系统对 Web3 至关重要？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/f69a33820d7f82c1ce5ada6580293b92.jpg-article)\n\n这也就意味着用户和应用开始将 ENS 名称作为自己默认的一种用户名了。更有意思的是，设置过反向解析的地址，会在以太坊用户最大的区块浏览器 Etherscan 上直接显示 ENS 账户名。\n\n![ENS 空投在即，为什么说去中心化域名及账户系统对 Web3 至关重要？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/0a7b52d5d471ce8565d8f669567968a9.jpg-article)\n\n在反向解析功能刚推出后，社区其实并未大规模意识到该功能的用处，但是 ENS 团队举办了相关社区活动，鼓励更多应用和用户设置反向解析 （因为这个功能需要额外步骤操作） ，所以才被各个应用和用户了解。\n\n#### 第三方协议集成：Web3 应用的默认账户系统？\n\n另外 ENS 也成为了不少协议集成使用的账户系统，一般是通过二级域名的方式实现的，比如三大 Web3 应用 **Mirror** 、 **Radicle** 和 **Argent** 。\n\n**Mirror** 是去中心化的内容发布平台，文字内容通过存储在 Arweave 实现永久存储，而业务逻辑和账户系统则是搭建在以太坊之上。由于 Mirror 拥有 Mirror.xyz 这个传统域名，而 ENS 又和 xyz 域名开展了深度合作，所以 xyz 域名也可以运作在 ENS 的体系之中。\n\nMirror 账户系统神奇的地方在于包含了双重功能：既可以作为以太坊地址的映射，也可以作为网站的链接。\n\n用户可以注册 （目前还未完全对外开放） 一个 mirror.xyz 的二级域名作为用户的账户名和网址，比如 Linda Xie 的 Mirror 账户是「linda.mirror.xyz」，在 ENS 中该账户会解析至一个以太坊地址，而且可以直接在网页浏览器访问该链接进入 Linda Xie 的 Mirror 页面。\n\n**Radicle** 的做法也比较类似，它是一个去中心化的代码管理工具 （类似于 GitHub） ，在 Radicle 系统中用户可以注册一个「radicle.eth」的二级域名，作为整个 Radicle 网络的用户名和唯一标识符。\n\n**Argent** 是一个基于智能合约的加密货币钱包，用户可以注册一个「argent.xyz」的二级域名作为用户的账户名，方便用户使用钱包工具。巧合的是，上述三个项目的官方网站都是 .xyz 结尾的，是因为 ENS 早期对于 .xyz 的支持更友好，目前已经开放至更通用的域名系统了。\n\n### 新秀：DAS、Unstoppable Domains 、Handshake 和 FIO\n\n除了以上这两个最早的域名系统外，还有几个比较新型的协议也值得关注，特别是 **DAS** 、 **Unstoppable Domains** 、 **Handshake** 和 **FIO** 。\n\n#### DAS：专注互操作性，支持任意区块链\n\nDAS 的全称是 Decentralized Account Systems （去中心化账户系统） ，它采用 **Nervos** 作为该系统的基础设施，也正因为采用了 Nervos，它相比以太坊可以实现很多独特的功能，比如可以使用任意公链的私钥来注册和管理 DAS。\n\n从具体用例来说，DAS 目前已经支持了通过 ETH 和 TRX 的私钥来管理和控制 DAS 协议，这也就意味着以太坊用户可以直接管理到 Nervos 网络中和 DAS 相关的智能合约，而不需要生成 Nervos 的地址。\n\n![ENS 空投在即，为什么说去中心化域名及账户系统对 Web3 至关重要？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/cd2f838eeccc346b84e8472338e83e02.jpg-article)\n\n能实现这个功能是因为 Nervos 协议的底层设计上更抽象，可以兼容任意区块链的特定密码学算法。比如此前另一个名为 Portal Wallet 的团队曾演示过可以通过以太坊地址收发 Nervos 网络中的资产，就是因为 Nervos 可以支持以太坊的公私钥算法。\n\n从 **钱包支持** 上来说，DAS 应该说是仅次于 ENS 的了，已经支持了多个主流钱包，包括 TokenPocket、imToken、HuobiWallet、AlphaWallet、HyperPay、BitKeep 等，像 NFTScan，NFTGo 这些应用都已经集成了 DAS。\n\n另外 DAS 也采用了 **「.bit」域名** ，毕竟这个域名不是 Namecoin 团队的专利，也没有被 ICANN 注册过，所以大家也都可以使用，虽然可能会对 Namecoin 的老用户造成一些困扰，但其实应该已经没有 Namecoin 的老用户了 （比如我就曾经注册过一堆 Namecoin 账号，但从来没续过费） 。\n\nDAS 最核心的场景除了可以作为统一的加密货币收款账户，支持收发多链的资产之外，还可以作为个人信息的主页 （bit.cc） ，或作为去中心化网站的域名等。但从团队的愿景和产品名称上来说，DAS 更像是一个账户系统，而域名只是附带的一种功能。\n\n在上线主网后 DAS 的数据增长也是值得关注的，根据官方最新的数据显示，近三个月独立注册的地址数超过了 **5000** 个，注册的账户超过了 **2.5 万** 个，而且目前仅开放了 4 位以及以上总量的 35%，后续应该会随着系统成熟逐渐开放更多可注册账号。\n\n#### Unstoppable Domains：永久所有权域名\n\nUnstoppable Domains 推出了可购买永久所有权的「.crypto」 （和其他更多） 顶级域名，而且 Unstoppable Domains 在浏览器集成中有非常大的优势，它也几乎支持了 ENS 支持的浏览器。除此之外，Unstoppable Domains 还自己开发了网页浏览器 （基于 Chrome 的开源版本） ，可以提供更完美的用户体验。\n\nUnstoppable Domains 并没有推出独立的区块链，而是基于其他区块链的智能合约即可，比如「.cryptp」的域名服务就是以太坊网络中的智能合约系统，从这个角度来说，它可以比较方便的借鉴 ENS 协议。\n\n#### Handshake：可拍卖任何顶级域名\n\nHandshake 的野心则更大一些，希望从命名空间的初始开始，搭建出一个完全平行于 ICANN 的体系，在这个系统中，无论用户想注册「.crypto」还是「.eth」都可以，但是要先进行拍卖，所以它可以提供无限种可能性的域名结构。而且它为了迁移现有的 DNS 体系，还为那些全球最知名的网站进行了预留，这些域名的持有者只要通过密码学的验证就可以获取在 Handshake 中的域名。\n\nHandshake 是 **独立的公链** ，并采取 **PoW** 挖矿机制，也有专业的团队推出了 Handshake 的矿机。不过这可能会带来的一个问题是，原本只需要处理业务逻辑的协议，还需要额外担心网络的算力以及被攻击的可能性，而 ENS 和 Unstoppable Domains 只需要依赖以太坊的安全性即可。\n\n#### FIO Protocol：专注于加密货币钱包集成\n\nFIO Protocol 是一个专注于和钱包合作的去中心化账户系统，因为它的全称是 Foundation for Interwallet Operability （钱包间可操作性基金会） 。它最重要的合作方是 **钱包** ，因为它是加密货币的入口级应用。与钱包深度集成可以为 FIO 协议提供更完整的用户体验，比如对于交易功能而言，可以提供「请求交易」、「上下文交易」等功能。\n\nFIO Protocol 也推出了自己的区块链网络，采用 **dPoS 共识** ，这可能会成为它承载高性能的优势，也可能会成为质疑它安全性的劣势。\n\n### 总结\n\n基于区块链的去中心化域名和去中心化账户系统已经诞生了 10 年，先驱 Namecoin 虽然还在运行，但是已经成为了一个小众的项目，用户采用度也比较低。\n\n后来 ENS 则是走了一条更实用主义的路线，而且随着以太坊生态的快速扩张，也获得很多的红利，许多第三方应用利用它搭建特定的账户系统，成为了以太坊生态不可或缺的一种基础设施。\n\n也正因为它与以太坊生态如此深度的绑定，可能会限制它成为一个更通用的协议，毕竟用一个以太坊域名「.eth」收发 Solana、Mina、BTC、BSC 之类的资产，总感觉怪怪的。\n\n所以从这个角度来说，「.crypto」、「.bit」或者可自定义顶级域名的协议会更大气一些，他们的域名通用性更好一些。除此之外，这些协议还在从钱包集成、互操作性、所有权模式探索更多可能性。\n\n不过还好这个赛道的项目数量没有像 DeFi 这么多，也没有特别同质化。无论未来这类协议是一家独大还是多协议并存，其实并不重要，但是我相信在 Web3 的世界中，一定需要这样的去中心化域名和账户体系，承载应用、网站和用户身份，但目前的这些项目还是处于非常早期的探索阶段，在协议集成、用户体验、与 Web2 世界的接入，还有很多很多改进空间", "timestamp": 1636163365, "digest": "OWVBWPBbLUFMVqaysMJ447LZLoQVk8kA5RK7WkigbVA", "contributor":

打金史：游戏公会正在演绎元宇宙的「荷马史诗」时代](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/e63cfa988ccb51629bb95ac765c3546b_BiP3FAJ.png-article)\n\n*本文是一篇写给 MaoDao 社区以及元宇宙赛道投资者的文章，可以预见，未来一段时间内会出现各种各样的 DAO、公会以及元宇宙项目，我们复盘过去的成绩和失误，在快速发展的 NFT 赛道调整方向，继续出发。*\n\n*同时，期望跳脱出从业者的桎梏，从更大的视角俯视整个行业并展望元宇宙的未来。MaoDao 将在本文中开诚布公过去半年内参与打金的财务数据、运营经验、未来畅想等，以作启发。*\n\n公元前 12 世纪，「荷马史诗」描述迈锡尼文明衰落，古希腊充斥着战乱纷争，群雄逐鹿，这一时代也被称为「希腊的中世纪」。但随后，灿烂的古希腊城邦时代开启，大城邦如雅典、斯巴达兴起，开始拥有各自的子民、文化以及独立铸币的能力，城邦民主制度诞生。\n\n公元 2021 年，11 月伊始，脸书改名，蛰伏许久的 Metaverse 板块迎来新一轮爆发，在一轮周围热闹嘈杂的讨论之中，又恍惚体会到身处加密行业的某种宿命感，「历史的车轮滚滚向前，所有的拦路者都将被碾碎」。\n\n此时也恰逢 MaoDao 成立链游 Axie Infinity 玩赚公会的第 180 天。这半年时间，MaoDao 从零开始，打怪升级，拥有核心游戏打金以及 NFT 社区，也孵化创造出 Ready Player Cat 这一具有东方元素的加密原生 IP。\n\n不可否认的是，所谓的「元宇宙」还处于早期，或许目前我们一切所做的都是探索在元宇宙的雏形。如果把 Metaverse 看作未来世界的大潮流，那我们或许正处于大潮流开启史前精彩的「荷马史诗」时代。\n\n如今的加密世界孕育着元宇宙的精神内涵，各式各样如同「荷马史诗」时代们英（神）雄（经）们的故事重演正在发生，穿过迷雾，过去和未来押韵，仿佛看到几百年之后的一场脑机教学的片段中是这么写道：\n\n「公元 21 世纪，各种早期游戏公会以及 Dao 已开启探索尝试，随后开始发行各自的通证和治理制度，在数字世界中拥有自己的社区成员，形成独特的虚拟经济体，辉煌灿烂的 Metaverse 时代也即将开启。」\n\n### Play-to-earn 我们在做什么？\n\n我们通常将 Play-to-earn 称为「边玩边赚」，简单通俗一点说，我们在做一项「带着玩家去打游戏」的事业。事实上，目前 Play-to-earn 模式的门槛非常低，但由于模式简单，也易于上手以及传播。\n\n想要搭建一个 Axie Infinity 公会非常简单，你只需要三样东西：拥有一部分 Axie 小精灵资产、拥有一帮每天可抽出约 3 小时打游戏的玩家、拥有指导玩家的方法以及管理社区的流程。\n\n事实上，由于门槛较低、行业较新，公会的玩家等数据也易于产生误区，比如链游公会玩家数量的表述就是一个很模糊的数据。由于目前切实存在的一个玩家玩多个账号、玩多个游戏等情况，如果某一个链游公会表示自己有 XXX 名玩家却没有加上「具体时效内」和「哪一个游戏」则可看作一个不准确的说法，正确的统计应该是在链游公会在某一游戏长期的平均玩家数量。\n\n我们发现，受限于基础设施的匮乏，目前 Play-to-earn 打金的流程是极其人工化的，比如我们的社区管理员既需要具备拥有指导玩家的方法，也需要每日统计数据以及管理社区的流程。在此期间，我们遇到的问题包括：\n\n* 新玩家在体验游戏后的几天至第一周的时间内停玩（Quit）的几率很高。以 MaoDao 从 5 月 30 日发布 Axie Infinity 教程文章开始，参与报名的玩家一直踊跃积极，前后共大概有近 600 名玩家曾经尝试过或者体验过 Axie，而最终稳定且坚持下来的大概在 150 位左右的核心玩家，形成 MaoDao 的核心游戏社区。\n* 链游的社区管理员需要具备拥有指导玩家的方法，并学会处理并协调大量社区内的琐事，这些都是要耗费大量的时间及精力。主要包括需要带领新手玩家进行游戏上手、对前几日的游戏需要进行指导教学、以及后续如何在 PvP 对战中提高胜率等。另外，如果玩家不满意分配到的 Axie 小精灵，也需要找管理员协调。\n* 目前仍然存在一个玩家使用多个账号去玩的「作弊」现象，这对于我们是极其具有风险的，因为一旦被官方发现作为封号处理的话，我们就会损失账户内的 Axie 小精灵资产。所以，我们的游戏管理员会在初期去查看每一名玩家的对战记录，并每日做出相应的统计分析，针对不同的玩家进行指导、交流、协调或者警告收回等操作。\n\n![复盘 MaoDao

帮助我们理解并实践元宇宙最底层的逻辑\n\n经过半年的时间的打金及游戏社区建设，我们认为，元宇宙最底层的建设是围绕着三个核心维度展开的，分别是：「人」、「资产」、「平台及标准」，分别对应公会中的「玩家」、「Axie 小精灵」、「社区管理的平台及方法」。而以 YGG 为代表的链游公会则是在最早期侧重于「人」即「玩家」开展业务，并随后侧重于「资产」铺开规模。\n\n如果再进一步规模化，一些具有实力的大公会比如 YGG 已经具备了元宇宙底层建设的两大核心即「人」和「资产」，再去进行产品化打造「平台」，乃至于制定未来元宇宙的「标准」也是未来可期的。\n\n![复盘 MaoDao 打金史：游戏公会正在演绎元宇宙的「荷马史诗」时代](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/93c577af48d9530eba1817f494a57863.png-article)\n\n### Play-to-earn 可以产生真实的现金流并支持后续发展\n\n首先，虽然上文我们提到的「玩家数量」是一个模糊的概念，但是链游公会产生的真实现金流是不会撒谎的。以 Play-to-earn 作为开始，包括 MaoDao 在内的许多自下而上的链游组织逐渐开始产生真实现金流以及核心社区。以下是 MaoDao 打金公会从 5 月 30 日以来的数据：\n\n![复盘 MaoDao 打金史：游戏公会正在演绎元宇宙的「荷马史诗」时代](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/89d8c79c30f25ee982e932e2a87faf4b.png-article)\n\n从 Play-to-earn 打金开始，到后续的游戏社区建设，未来我们还可以做的事情包括：\n\n* 围绕着游戏玩家的社区建设，扩大规模化\n* 围绕着玩家开发 NFT 或游戏工具，进行产品化\n* 围绕着 Dao 的治理建设，增强去中心化\n* 围绕着链游资产的投资配置，进行资本化\n\n### Play-to-earn 让我们思考元宇宙的意义和未来\n\nPlay-to-earn （边玩边赚）的概念因 Axie Infinity 而兴起，并在全球范围内爆红，东西方玩家都可以加入像 Axie 这类游戏中来，要么投入时间，要么投入金钱，或者投入技术，在这个和现实更加贴近的新互联网中创造和交换价值、弥合差异。\n\n上面所说的都是 Play-to-earn 好的一面，那这个机制是否也具有缺陷仍然需要改进？事实上，我们在早期参与打金的过程中也遇到一些困惑，以下是我们的自问自答：\n\n**Q：首先，我们为什么选择 Axie Infinity 为主的链游？是因为该款游戏较高的游戏性吗？**\n\nA：我们选择 Axie Infinity 主要是因为链游的共性 —— 区块链和加密经济模型，可构建一套包含稀缺资源的内生资产。具体体现在，游戏中不论是宠物角色本身、土地、装备还是货币，都可以围绕 DeFi 自由二级市场和自流通，意味着可为玩家带来实际的收入。同时，Axie Infinity 拥有成熟的 Scholarship （奖学金）模式，方便世界各地的玩家组织进行打金的组织。\n\n**Q：Play-to-earn 的真正意义是什么？如果有一个完全模仿人类行为的 AI 打金，那么我们（包括公会或玩家）现在在做的事情有什么意义？**\n\nA：Play-to-earn 已经为链游行业带来全新的叙事，广而熟知的是，对于某些发展中国家的居民来说，是一个很好的谋生之道，比如 Axie Infinity 主要玩家市在于菲律宾，他们花费时间在游戏打怪中谋取生活费，远高于当地居民的平均工资水平，虚拟游戏已经与现实生活息息相关了。\n\n在我们的概念里，连通虚拟世界与现实世界的边界，打通双边的维度的每一个尝试都是在探索元宇宙的雏形，比如 VR 打通人体观感的边界，NFT 打通身份和资产属性的边界，而 Play-to-earn 打通是时间与收入的边界，而所有的的维度再经过长期发展后，最终会形成一个拥有完全独立闭环的元宇宙生态。\n\n除此以外，我们认为 Play-to-earn 带来的意义和创新包括：\n\n* Play-to-earn 带来可拓展性极强的游戏及社交生态，以及不同于传统游戏以游戏性吸引玩家消费的主流模式，创造出一种全新元宇宙背景的游戏叙事；\n* Play-to-earn 是依托于无许可的加密金融基础设施，基于传统游戏打金模式所创造出的新型游戏激励模式。但受限于目前链游水平的发展，还处处带着传统游戏的影子；\n* Play-to-earn 模式尝试在收入及时间的维度上打通虚拟世界和现实世界的边界，目前单纯的「时间换奖励」的模式是形成未来元宇宙与现实生态闭环中「收入与时间」闭环的早期雏形；\n* Play-to-earn 规模化的过程实际上也是凝聚以玩家为主的社区及共识的过程。在此过程中产生的真实现金流以及资产运作可以让整个打金组织尝试 Dao 的治理、游戏资产的配置、搭建平台或工具，这些都是社区驱动而积累的财富。朝更远的未来去想，制定元宇宙的「标准」或许也未来可期；\n\n关于 AI 打金的意义，这是一个我们与我们的好伙伴 RCT AI 共同探讨过的问题。MaoDao 认为，针对目前的 Axie Infinity 的模式，AI 打金虽然可做出不错的数据并获得不错的收入，但无法吸引玩家（除去 AI 以外的玩家）更多的投入，包括时间的投入、社交上投入、新的资产上投入，过度的 AI 打金也有可能打破目前游戏内经济模型的平衡。但不意味着 AI 打金是没有意义的，未来总会出现一类型适合 AI 参与的游戏。由于想象力有限，我们还没办法想象出具体游戏机制。\n\n**Q：目前越来越多所谓的「打金工作室」开始参与 Play-to-earn 并且发币。打金的门槛是不是越低越好？未来会如何发展？**\n\n首先，我们不认为目前以人工为主、用时间换奖励的 Play-to-earn 的模式是打金的终极形态，未来元宇宙的「打金」包含的不仅仅是打游戏，或将包括建建筑、使用技术开发游戏工具等等元素。\n\n同时，我们也不认为扩大打金规模并发行治理代币的模式是游戏公会的唯一形态，MaoDao 尝试使用 RPC NFT

生态版图](https://www.chainnews.com/articles/930028948285.htm)\n\n**撰文：Amber Group编译：Perry Wang**\n\n[Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) 协议的愿景是提供去中心化、可扩展和永久的链上数据存储。就像以太坊被认为是世界计算机，Arweave 可以被认为是永远不会忘记的世界硬盘。 该协议结合了创新的区块链技术和巧妙的博弈论设计机制，以打造一个健康和可持续的网络。\n\n![读懂 Arweave 如何利用博弈设计实现永久网络存储](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/8743533166955e859a6dc1068c0c28ae_YaKwLpU.png-article)\n\n### 通过激励实现永久存储\n\nArweave 使用一种称为 blockweaves 的新型数据结构，它是对区块链原始设计的迭代更新。每个区块都链接到两个先前的区块：\n\n* 链（类似于比特币等传统区块链）中的前一个区块；\n* 来自区块链先前历史的一个区块（「recall 区块」）\n\n矿工必须有权访问 recall 区块以挖掘出新区块并获得奖励（随机访问的简洁证明，简称 SPoRA）。由于 recall 区块的选择是不可预测的，矿工被激励存储大量数据，从而增加他们访问正确 recall 区块的几率，由此可以挖出新区块并获得挖矿奖励。激励机制还鼓励矿工存储稀有区块而不是复制良好区块，因为前者意味着与之竞争相同级别的奖励的矿工数量较少。\n\n![读懂 Arweave 如何利用博弈设计实现永久网络存储](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/f46517bd586d57c5bc989f8abd9d8c9e.png-article)\n\n因此，Arweave 采取概率和激励驱动方法，来确保数据的可复制性和永久存储。这些激励措施的净效应是：区块被网络丢弃的可能性几乎为零。\n\n![读懂 Arweave 如何利用博弈设计实现永久网络存储](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/dc1a83bf57cb59adaf575cb5ea737af0_uJUAkrF.png-article)\n\n请注意，上图假设矿工随机存储区块。由于矿工被激励存储稀有区块，因此丢弃区块的实际概率低于反映的概率。\n\n### 一次付费，永久存储\n\nArweave 用户一次性支付预付费用，以永久存储自己的数据。这与一些 Web2 或 Web3 存储平台（例如亚马逊云 /AWS、谷歌云或 Filecoin）形成鲜明对比，在上述平台中，用户通常需要进行重复性交易。我们相信 Arweave 模式提供了一种完全不同的体验——一种更适合 Web3 的体验。订阅现收现付平台的客户可能会因未来价格上涨或条款变化而「沦为肉票」，而 Arweave 用户可以免费重复访问存储的数据。\n\n用户支付的所有交易费用并非全部立即转给矿工。相反，其中约 86% 归属一个捐赠基金，随着时间推移，捐赠基金向矿工分发费用，以确保可持续的矿工经济（以及永久存储）。捐赠基金目前正在积累其储备金，预计得等到 Arweave 的 permaweb （永久网络）比当前表面网络大上几倍后，才会开始向矿工支付。\n\n捐赠基金模型的可持续性得到存储价格随时间下降这一假设的支持。50 年来，存储成本年均下降 30.6%。Arweave 的交易定价模型 [保守估计这些成本每年只下降 0.5%](https://ardrive.io/topic/arweave-economics/)。\n\n请注意，尽管 CPU 领域的摩尔定律升级步伐正在减速，但目前消费存储硬件领域的最大数据密度仍远低于研究中实现密度或理论最大极限。即使假设相当乐观的 30% 的数据密度年增长率，要达到理论极限也需要 400 多年的时间。换句话说，Arweave 的捐赠基金模型的愿景是将矿工经济维持几个世纪。\n\n### 利用行之有效的博弈论设计\n\n点对点（P2P）下载协议 BitTorrent 于 2001 年推出，成为最大的 P2P 文件共享协议，一度占全球互联网流量的 60% 以上。它的成功很大程度上归功于其优雅的博弈论设计，被称为「乐观的以牙还牙」（optimistic tit-for-tat）策略。 BitTorrent 节点乐观地与其他节点合作，但会惩罚不合作的行为，促使网络中的大多数参与者采取良性行动。\n\nArweave 借鉴了这一行之有效的框架设计。Arweave 网络中的每个矿工都有自己的专有算法来对其他节点进行排名，按照自己眼中具有最高效用的节点进行排名，并相应地将自己的稀缺资源分配给他们。因此，Arweave 的网络具有很强的韧性和适应新环境的能力。\n\n例如，今年 3 月，Arweave 网络中的一些节点识别出一部分矿工使用池化软件，这些矿工的做法有损于 Arweave 实现数据可复制性最大化的目标。随后，另一组矿工 [修改了他们的排名算法](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en/karma)，降低这些矿工的优先级，阻止免费加载行为并改善网络的整体健康状况。\n\n### 构建：解锁可扩容性\n\n今年 9 月，Arweave 发布了有效的第 2 层（L2）扩容解决方案：[Bundles](https://arweave.news/bundles/)。通过 Bundles，每笔 Arweave 交易都被移到链下，与其他交易并成一组，然后作为一个大交易放回主链。利用这一方式，使得极大的数据文件可以很容易地上传到 Arweave 网络。 9 月曾有 [单个区块上传了 47GB 的数据](https://viewblock.io/arweave/block/772863)。 Bundles 还可以改善交易确定性和开发者体验。Bundles 的发布催化了 blockweave 大小的阶梯式增长，表明用户和开发者之间产生了强烈的共鸣。\n\n![读懂 Arweave 如何利用博弈设计实现永久网络存储](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/8fbc06a03500533880f2889265442e4d_Id4xpGp.png-article)\n\n### 市场竞争格局\n\nArweave 通常被与 Filecoin 进行比较，后者可能是最著名的去中心化存储平台。\n\nFilecoin 由 [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/) 于 2014 年创立， Protocol Labs 团队是创建星际文件系统 (IPFS) 的幕后团队。IPFS 是去中心化数据存储的基础技术协议，使用内容寻址来识别文件。虽然多数文件当前是通过它们的位置（例如它们存储在哪个服务器上）找到的，但 IPFS 通过数据是什么来识别文件。用户使用这些标识符，可以在彼此之间共享和下载文件。Filecoin 充当 IPFS 之上的经济层，以激励节点托管 IPFS 数据。\n\nArweave 和 Filecoin 之间的经济模型存在很多方面的不同。Filecoin 采用现收现付模式运行，与 AWS 和谷歌云的费用机制非常相似。与 Arweave 不同的是，Filecoin 主要提供临时存储解决方案而不是永久存储解决方案。\n\n此外，在 Filecoin 协议中，用户和节点之间有数千种不同的合约，每一种都有不同的存储条款（例如价格、持续时间、复制次数等）。相比之下，Arweave 平台上实际上只提供一种合约 : 数据永久保存。\n\n![读懂 Arweave 如何利用博弈设计实现永久网络存储](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/a8e73cc4a06c5a6794c8ac2260aff747_EJHpqCN.png-article)\n\n因此，我们认为 Arweave 不会与 Filecoin （以及类似的变体）直接竞争。两者的解决方案实际上可能是互补的。在某些情况下，永久存储数据会更划算；在其他情况下，为短期存储付费更有意义。事实上，很难找到另一个与 Arweave 具有类似价值主张的平台——IPFS 最接近，但后者没有经济激励，文件仍然可以从 IPFS 的网络中被丢弃。 例如，Infura 的 IPFS 固定服务会 [删除六个月内未访问用户的数据](https://community.infura.io/t/does-data-that-hasnt-been-used-in-the-past-6-months-get-deleted/3423)。\n\n![读懂 Arweave 如何利用博弈设计实现永久网络存储](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/e92880e2ab8c50e8af81481eca4fb2a3_rf7eNFb.png-article)\n\n### Web3 堆栈中的用例\n\nArweave 最初主网启动后增长缓慢，但今年凭借接纳许多 Web3 应用而获得了显著的市场吸引力。下文中我们概述了一些用例，以展示 Arweave 如何找到市场契合点，且更清楚地演示 permaweb 带来的独特机会。\n\n#### 为 NFT 提供安全性\n\nNFT 的购买者理论上购买的是不可变、永久的对象。然而，这些文件很少存储在链上——对于大多数 NFT 项目来说，链上存储的成本高得令人望而却步。 相反，NFT 的智能合约通常将实际内容存储在一个简单的通证 URI 中，该 URI 指向数字对象实际所在的互联网地址。\n\n这带来了一个问题：大多数 URI 不能保证永久性或不变性。例如，World of Women NFT 项目 [将其图像文件存储在 AWS 上](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe785e82358879f061bc3dcac6f0444462d4b5330#readContract)，这意味着这些文件将来可能被更改和删除。 @pencilflip 对 22 个顶尖 NFT 项目的调研结果发现，50% 的项目将其文件存储在中心化服务器上。\n\n![读懂 Arweave 如何利用博弈设计实现永久网络存储](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/687b1baa1e24576d9aa25bd4dcedd6b4.png-article)\n\n即使是 IPFS 也不能保证永久性。 CheckMyNFT 发现了一些 [蓝筹艺术家的资产](https://twitter.com/CheckMyNFT/status/1369802069729812483)，包括 Grimes、Deadmau5 和 Steve Aoki，尽管托管在 IPFS 上，但这些资产暂时离线。再举一个例子， nft.storage 号称其提供的数据「将在 IPFS 中无限期可用」。 然而，它的 [用户条款和使用条件警告](https://nft.storage/terms/) 说，「数据将无限期地持续存在，直到 Protocol Labs 决定结束 NFT.storage 项目。」\n\n鉴于这个问题变得日益突出，艺术家和创作者越来越多地使用 Arweave 的 NFT 存储平台，包括著名 NFT 艺术家 Beeple 和嘻哈巨星 Jay-Z。\n\n> 这个 NFT 的持久性评分被列为优秀。这一 NFT 相关的元数据质量高于当前的行业标准。元数据存储在智能合约中，并符合所有 NFT 平台所采用的以太坊改进提案 (EIP) 中的所有标准。与这一 NFT 相关的媒体数据存储在最强大的分散式文件存储系统 Arweave 上。\n>\n> ——苏富比拍卖行对 Jay-Z 首个 NFT [Heir to the Throne](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2021/jay-z-x-derrick-adams-heir-to-the-throne-an-nft/heir-to-the-throne) 的鉴定报告\n\n除了图像 NFT 项目外，Mirror （将文本文章作为 NFT）和 Pianity （音频 NFT）等媒体平台也将其文件托管在 Arweave 上。由于 Arweave 具有独特的优势，可以提供去中心化的永久性和不变性，我们预计将在 NFT 和创作者经济中继续见证 Arweave 采用率的增长。\n\n### 用户界面— 隐藏的中心化触点\n\nDeFi 的爆炸式增长，说明了可以通过为用户提供可自由访问、自主和透明的平台来解锁无尽的创新数量。不过，这些平台面临着一个隐藏的中心化风险：前端用户界面。云提供商仍然有能力停止和审查 dApp，而即使大多数用户更喜欢旧版本，开发者也可以强制前端更改和「更新」。\n\n这种事情已经发生了。今年 7 月，Uniswap 出于对美国监管政策的担忧，从其前端删除了代币化股票。用户界面下的智能合约仍然存在，开发者只是想把它隐藏起来。作为回应，[用户在 Arweave 上传了 Uniswap 之前的用户界面（UI）](https://arweave.net/im421JhtI34CY0UjV7CCeFJBPE2b4N6X04aasCffaxU)，使用户可以访问审查之前的 Uniswap 版本。permaweb 上还有其他平台，如 Sushiswap、Compound 和 1inch 的未审查版本，最大限度地减少审查的威胁。\n\n### 区块链存储\n\n区块链是不断增长的分类账。这些分类账本应该永远存在，但很少有人愿意存储旧链数据。随着区块链网络的迅猛发展，这个问题变得更加复杂。\n\n![读懂 Arweave 如何利用博弈设计实现永久网络存储](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/60269843a13b54299da2b36dde16ed52_QT52z4n.png-article)\n\n对于 Solana 等高性能区块链来说，这个问题尤其严重。Solana 所产生的区块，相当于以太坊、比特币、波卡（Polkadot）、Algorand 和 Cosmos 所产生区块总和的两倍还多。\n\n开发者没有设计内部解决方案，而是转向了 Arweave 的技术。\n\n> 构建高性能智能合约平台的挑战之一是要确保账本数据具有高度容错、去中心化的存储解决方案……当进入多链的未来，区块链可以且应该专业化和互操作。当一个完美的解决方案已经存在，并且比我们可以构建的任何东西在经济上更合理时，我们再去构建一个专用的存储网络并强加给验证者是不可理喻的。\n>\n> —— Anatoly Yakovenko，Solana Labs 联合创始人\n\nArweave 已经与 Solana、Cosmos、Polkadot、Avalanche、NEAR 和 Skale [合作](https://mobile.twitter.com/samecwilliams/status/1409549899805478915)。 区块链索引协议 the Graph 也将 [支持 Arweave](https://thegraph.com/blog/graph-arweave)，允许更有效地访问存档的区块链数据。\n\n#### 其他用例\n\n我们在上面只展示了几个用例，但 Arweave 的技术解决了 Web3 和现实世界的多个问题，例如 [财务审计](https://ambcrypto.com/following-tether-scandals-stablecoins-are-rebuilding-trust-with-the-permaweb/)、[媒体发布](https://mirror.xyz/) 和 [信息存档](https://arweave.medium.com/arweave-the-internet-archive-building-a-verifiable-record-of-history-9787ba018020)。此外，我们相信通过创造新的特性和功能，Arweave 的技术将创造新的市场和用例，推动可用市场的总规模进一步扩大。\n\n### 代币经济学\n\nArweave 的原生代币 AR 的创世供应量为 5500 万个。最大代币流通总量将是 6600 万个 AR 代币。新的 AR 代币的发行类似于比特币模式，其中所发行的代币定期减半，只是 Arweave 的发行速率连续减半，而比特币有离散的减半事件。目前总共发行了约 6400 万个 AR 代币。大约 22% 的已发行代币由顾问、项目团队所持有，或为未来使用和开发而持有。这表明当前的公众持币者面临最多 24% 的稀释（22% 来自内部人士释出当前代币 + 2% 的剩余生命周期通胀率）。\n\n![读懂 Arweave 如何利用博弈设计实现永久网络存储](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/eaf8cb1f39b85c169015dcba4a0d2b7e_pUuuiHe.png-article)\n\n随着对 Arweave 协议存储需求的增加，AR 代币的价值预计会上涨。此外，随着大部分交易费用被发送到 Arweave 的捐赠基金，代币不断退出公共流通。 举个简单的例子，如果 Arweave 网络总规模增长到 10PB，每 TB 的费用约为 200 AR （当前成本约为每 TB 480 AR），大约 170 万个代币将从公共流通中取退出。这些代币最终将被重新引入流通——矿工需要将它们卖掉以支付存储成本——但重新入市的步伐可能是渐进的，且会随着时间推移而发生。\n\n因此，Arweave 用户可以期待自己所持有的代币增值，途径有二：对固定供应的需求增加，以及交易费用进入捐赠基金所带来的代币退出流通。\n\n### 总结\n\nArweave 幕后团队深思熟虑地启动了该网络。 Arweave 引入了 [利润分享代币](https://arweave.medium.com/profit-sharing-tokens-a-new-incentivization-mechanism-for-an-open-web-1f2532411d6e)，使开发者能从在 Arweave 上构建的应用中赚取「微红利」，激励创始人在 Arweave 上构建应用。它还定期举办 [Open Web Foundry](https://owf.dev/)，这是一项为期六周的计划，旨在帮助企业家将其想法在 Arweave 的平台上推向市场。所有这些举措都有助于 Arweave 生态系统的蓬勃发展。\n\n![读懂 Arweave 如何利用博弈设计实现永久网络存储](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/b1a41b1404785ee5b56b694336905ccc_tCRPmqD.png-article)\n\nArweave 现在还只是刚刚起步；执行和采用风险比比皆是。尽管如此，Arweave 对未来的目标是非常远大的。如果成功，它可以成为 Web3

- 蔑视传统系统\n\n在分析马斯克这样的公众人物的真正意图时，很多人可能不会考虑推动模因力量的另一个潜在因素，即**模因蔑视传统系统的内在能力**。理查德•尼克松 (Richard Nixon) 在 1971 年终结美元与黄金的可兑换性，并实施了对工资 / 价格管制的行动，只会进一步突显货币作为一种工具的内在可塑性，是根据中央集权的动机和利益而形成的。\n\n![理解 Meme 经济的兴起：为何成为加密项目成功的主要催化剂之一？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/f3b047a7b3f2c0695023a16fe0064adc.jpg-article)\n\n从这个角度来看，可以说像 Dogecoin 这样的「**模因币**」是完全相反的——它们由数字原住民开发和支持，通过线上来交易和分享价值。就一般的模因而言，不会存在什么恶意的动机或者操纵目的 (不管该模因是否与「币」关联)。从这个意「上说」虽然美联储 (Fed) 可能会凭空铸造出数万亿美元，但马斯克也在用 Dogecoin 的例子来证明，当前的系统可以被同样可笑的东西来取代 (尽管这仍是一个假设)。(编者注：马斯克曾在 Twitter 上发推表示「狗狗币是人民的加密货币」(Dogecoin is the people's crypto)。)\n\n### 写在最后\n\n回顾以上的例子和重点，不难理解，模因和与之相关的「模因币」可能与中本聪一样，都代表了 Web3 文化。更重要的是，正如连续创业家、天使投资人和作家 Balaji Srinivasan 所说的那样，模因正在创造一种渐进式经济，作为 NFT （非同质化币) 领域的补充，或者可能演变成一个新兴的子类型。\n\n![理解 Meme 经济的兴起：为何成为加密项目成功的主要催化剂之一？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/6661e7210db3fd181be3aded9bd5eda2.jpg-article)\n\n", "timestamp": 1636165410, "digest": "3GqTrn36J43OeVQF4z85Bz81QsWyi6ksnIvbM7yau1Q", "contributor": "0x89ddA427e73F33f285277D88Dfa611696c31d881"}

unicorn**\n\n2019 年，第一版 Aave 协议智能合约（「Aave 协议」）被部署到以太坊主网上。Aave 协议的 V1 为用户提供了一种自主提供和获取流动性的方式，并从提供给协议的任何流动性中赚取收益。\n\n2020 年 12 月，部署了第二版 Aave 协议，为 DeFi 生态系统中的流动性提供和流动性访问带来了新功能。Aave 协议 V2 的特点之一是信用委托，用户可以在任何借入交易的稳定和可变利率之间进行选择，以及某些 gas 优化和改进。\n\n大约在同一时间，Aave Governance 获得了对 Aave 协议 V1 和 V2 的管理和维护，并负责围绕 Aave 协议的生态系统（「Aave 生态系统」）的持续发展。\n\nAave 生态系统在过去两年中有机发展，支持 Aave 协议的成功、安全和风险意识运作。社区也支持 Aave 协议从以太坊主网扩展到 Polygon 和 Avalanche 网络。\n\n经过这两年的大幅增长，此 Aave 对 Aave 治理的评论请求 (ARC) 寻求社区批准 Aave 协议的新迭代：引入 Aave V3。\n\nARC 提供了主要功能的概述，并通过 Snapshot 请求社区对潜在部署进行投票。正如我们今天所知，与 Aave V3 相关的功能代表了 DeFi 流动性协议的重大技术进步。\n\n正如下面更全面地讨论的那样，Aave V3 引入了以下功能（以及其他功能）：\n\n* 门户 ：允许资产通过不同网络在 Aave V3 市场之间无缝流动；\n* 高效模式 ：允许借款人从他们的抵押品中提取最高的借贷能力；\n* 隔离模式：通过只允许借款达到特定的债务上限来限制新上市资产对协议的暴露和风险；\n* 风险管理改进 ：通过各种风险上限和其他工具为协议提供额外保护；\n* L2-Specific Features ：专为二层网络设计，提升用户体验和可靠性；\n* 社区贡献 ：通过模块化、组织良好的代码库促进和激励社区使用。\n\n这些特性使 V3 成为有史以来设计的最强大、最高效的 DeFi 流动性协议。\n\n### 基于社区反馈的技术进步\n\n尽管 Aave 协议在过去两年中高效运行并取得了巨大的增长，但关于协议功能的社区分析为技术进步提供了关键领域：\n\n* 资本效率：V2 不允许用户在收益生成（在协议内和 / 或跨协议部署在各种网络上）或借用权力方面优化提供给 Aave 协议的资产。V3 解决了这个问题。\n* 风险缓解调整：虽然 Aave 协议目前具有可以由社区通过 Aave 治理激活的风险缓解功能，例如调整借贷能力和维护保证金，但附加功能可以提高众所周知的 Aave 协议智能合约固有的安全性。V3 解决了这个问题。\n* 去中心化：通过社区成员提交提案和创建子 DAO （GrantsDAO 和 RiskDAO），Aave 治理是稳健和蓬勃发展的。但是为了最大限度地去中心化，某些技术特性将允许 Aave Governance 通过委托给团队或其他个人来进一步去中心化其功能。V3 解决了这个问题。\n* 跨链促进：通过社区的努力，Aave 协议已部署在许多网络上，每个网络都有自己有意义的流动性水平。但是用户无法将他们自己的个人流动性从一个网络上的 Aave 协议部署无缝转移到另一个网络。V3 解决了这个问题。\n\nV3 的设计准备创建下一代第 0 层 DeFi 协议，该协议可以显着改善用户体验，同时提供更高的资本效率、更高程度的去中心化和进一步增强的安全性。\n\n### Aave V3 概述\n\nV3 保留了 Aave 协议已知的核心概念（aTokens、即时流动性、稳定利率借贷、信用委托等），同时提供了新功能，允许用户为 Aave 协议创建新用例，并可能引发新的来自社区的创新浪潮。\n\n本概述在旨在供社区更广泛使用的级别上描述了 V3 的新元素。开发人员的技术白皮书将单独发布。\n\n#### 门户网站\n\n门户允许用户通过不同网络从 V3 部署中无缝移动自己的资产。\n\n![先睹为快，Aave 将推出的 V3 版本有什么新功能？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/c452c1f53b0a5f9e82ee3de2b705f3ff_5uwlr8g.jpeg-article)\n\n其核心功能非常简单：用户提供的流动性可以从一个网络转移到另一个网络，只需在原始源网络（例如，以太坊）上燃烧 aToken，同时在目标网络（例如，Polygon）上铸造它们。围绕此功能构建的网络互连称为端口。\n\nPortal 将能够桥接 Connext、Hop Protocol、Anyswap、xPollinate 和其他利用 Aave 协议流动性以促进跨链交互的解决方案。Aave Governance 将能够在收到提议后授予对端口的任何跨链协议访问权限。\n\n#### 高效模式 (eMode)\n\n高效模式或「eMode」允许借款人确保他们能够用自己的抵押品获得最高的借贷能力。\n\n该代码允许 Aave Governance 根据以下参数对资产进行「分类」：\n\n* 生命周期价值\n* 清算门槛\n* 清算奖金\n* 自定义价格预言机（可选）\n\n这些因素会将 V3 中的每个不同资产设置为特定类别。如果借款人按类别限制借入的资产，则 eMode 为借款人提供了更多的资金获取途径。换言之，在 eMode 中，借款人可以选择他们想要借入的资产类别。「类别」通常是指与同一基础资产挂钩的一组资产——例如，与美元挂钩的稳定币、与 ETH 挂钩的资产等。\n\n如果用户在 eMode 中自行选择使用 Aave 协议，当该用户提供与用户抵押品相同类别的资产时，借贷能力（LTV）和维持保证金（清算阈值）将被 eMode 类别配置覆盖以允许更高的资本效率。\n\n![先睹为快，Aave 将推出的 V3 版本有什么新功能？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/e59d3393d5ef5e85b10d98675a854b45_EV7IdQp.jpeg-article)\n\n```\n协议定义 eMode 类别 1 （稳定币）如下：\n\n 97% 生命周期价值\n\n 98% 清算门槛\n\n2% 清算奖金\n\n没有自定义价格 oracle （预言机）\n\nKaren 选择 eMode 类别 1 （稳定币）\n\nKaren 提供 DAI （通常有 75% LTV）\n\nKaren 可以借入类别 1 （包括 DAI）中的其他稳定币，其借贷能力由 eMode 类别定义（97%）。因此，凯伦的资本效率提高了 22%。\n```\n\n注意：在这个例子中，Karen 可以提供其他非第 1 类资产作为抵押品；但是，只有属于用户选择的相同 eMode 类别的资产才会具有增强的特定于类别的风险参数。V3 eMode 最多可支持 255 个类别。\n\n### 新的风险管理参数\n\n#### 隔离模式\n\n「隔离模式」旨在允许 Aave Governance 在协议上创建新的资产市场时制定风险缓解功能。\n\n当社区成员提交在 V3 上创建新资产市场的治理提案时，该提案可以寻求将资产列为「隔离抵押品」，以便提供这些「隔离」资产的用户只能借入 Aave Governance 已「许可」的稳定币以隔离模式借款，最高达到指定的债务上限。\n\n当用户提供「隔离资产」作为抵押时，该用户只能使用该资产作为抵押；即使用户向协议提供其他资产，用户也只能通过这些资产赚取收益，而不能将这些资产用作抵押品。\n\n![先睹为快，Aave 将推出的 V3 版本有什么新功能？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/568b7a64545b5eadb5a9f68deb8f3810_BzX6OPX.jpeg-article)\n\n在上面的例子中，乍得提供 $TOKEN2 作为抵押品。$TOKEN2 是一种隔离资产，最高债务上限为 1000 万美元，USDT、DAI 和 USDC 作为「可借用」资产。在提供 $TOKEN2 作为抵押品后，乍得将能够借入高达 1000 万美元的 USDT、DAI 和 USDC。即使乍得提供另一种资产——假设是 ETH——V3 智能合约也不会允许乍得以这些资产为抵押借款，尽管乍得仍将通过提供的 ETH 赚取收益。如果乍得希望将所有资产用作抵押品并退出隔离模式，乍得只需进行交易以禁用 $TOKEN2 作为抵押品（受智能合约中有关抵押品比率、清算等的所有通常限制）。\n\n当 Aave Governance 对取消与该资产相关的债务上限的提案进行投票时，$TOKEN2 也可以退出隔离模式。\n\n### 风险管理功能\n\nV3 技术为 Aave Governance 提供了进一步增强的风险管理机制，以防止协议破产：\n\n* 供应和借用上限：Aave Governance 将能够配置借用和供应上限。借款上限将允许治理对可以借入的每种资产的数量设置限制，而供应上限允许治理投票以限制可以向 Aave 协议提供多少特定资产。借款上限可最大限度地减少流动性池的破产，而供应上限可减少协议对特定资产的风险，并有助于防止无限铸币或价格预言机操纵等攻击。\n* 精细借款权力控制：Aave Governance 将能够改变未来借款交易的抵押因素，而不会影响现有的借款头寸或触发清算。如果 Aave Governance 认为应该降低抵押品因素（即，借入交易需要更多抵押品），则 Aave Governance 可以对提案进行投票，以提高协议的整体健康度，而不会影响现有借款人。\n* 风险管理员：V3 引入了 Aave Governance 在「许可列表」上注册实体的能力，这将使这些实体能够在不需要治理投票的情况下更改某些风险参数。这些实体可以是 DAO （例如，RiskDAO、Gauntlet）或自动化代理，它们可以建立在此功能之上，以便在某个不变量被破坏时自动做出反应。添加到「许可列表」的任何实体都必须通过典型的治理提案流程添加。\n* 价格 Oracle Sentinel：Sentinel 特性专为第 2 层协议设计，用于处理排序器的最终停机时间（但可以扩展以处理其他情况，甚至在未来的 L1 上）。它引入了清算宽限期，并在特定情况下禁止借贷，这是 Aave Governance 响应社区提案所决定的。\n\n### 分散添加新资产\n\nV3 引入了「资产列表管理员」的新概念。借助此功能，Aave Governance 可以创建并向任何实体（甚至是智能合约）授予权利，以实施新策略以将资产添加到 Aave 协议，而不是通过链上投票。这将允许构建者创建自定义资产列表策略，这些策略可以设计为实现真正的无许可资产列表。\n\n#### 其他特性\n\n* 涉及代币传输的功能（例如，供应、偿还）支持 EIP 2612 许可（对于第 2 层部署很重要）；\n* 信用委托将支持 EIP 712 签名；\n* 用户可以使用 aTokens 代替原来借入的底层资产来偿还借入的头寸；\n* Aave Governance 可以「允许」实体获得即时流动性；\n* Aave Governance 可以重新配置提供给 Aave DAO 财政部的清算或即时流动性交易的任何费用；\n* 新的 flashloanSimple() 减少了高达 20% 的 gas 消耗（标准的、功能齐全的功能仍然可用）；\n* 价格预言机逻辑可以提供基础资产的广义计算（即不再仅是 ETH）；\n* 新的利率策略优化了稳定的利率计算（并消除了对贷款利率预言机的需要）；\n* 代码重组以更加模块化；与 V2 单存储库相比，V3 代码将分为三个不同的存储库——V3 核心、V3 外围、V3 部署。这促进了社区在不同网络上的贡献和部署；\n* 智能合约重构以减少代码大小（为将来的其他更改留出更多余地）→ 最多运行 100K 优化器！\n\n有了所有这些新功能，所有功能的 gas 成本仍然全面下降了大约 10-15%！\n\n### V2 / V3 代码兼容性\n\nV3 代码库是一组独立的智能合约，与 V2 智能合约不兼容。但是，一旦所有审核完成，V3 代码将开源，并且还将发布包含复古兼容版本 V3 的特定存储库。这种兼容性将允许社区更新 V2 合约，如果他们选择这样做的话。\n\n一旦 V3 代码经过更多实战测试，V3 代码将与主要 V3 存储库一起开源，用于部署在 Ethereum、Avalanche 和 Polygon 网络上。\n\n#### 社区快照投票\n\n此 ARC 旨在收集社区关于社区是否希望推进 Aave V3 的反馈。 已在此处创建快照投票：快照 71\n\n如果社区投票赞成，由 OpenZeppelin、Trail Of Bits、Peckshield 和 ABDK 进行的 Aave Protocol V3 代码库审计将在 11 月底或前后完成。此外，某些审核员可能会在发布前向 DAO 申请对代码进行额外审核。\n\n如果社区对 Aave 协议 V3 的部署投赞成票，则社区将有一组额外的 Snapshot 投票来确定以下内容：\n\n* 部署网络：鉴于包括 L2 在内的高效网络的激增，社区可以投票决定最初发布哪些网络 V3。V3 发布后最多可部署在三个网络上，因此快照将是「排名」投票。\n* V3 代码许可：鉴于 Aave 生态系统是高度分散和去中心化的，Aave 治理将决定哪种类型的许可（如果有）适用于 Aave 协议 V3 代码。据我们所知，这是 DeFi 领域的第一次！\n* V3 漏洞赏金计划：社区将决定漏洞赏金计划的规模、持续时间和范围，以及谁（例如，RiskDAO – 请参阅此处的提案提案：Aave Risk DAO 9) 将管理该程序。\n* 追溯资助：社区还可以决定是否向那些为 V3 的创建做出贡献的人提供追溯资助，以及提供多少资金。\n\n如果社区投票部署 V3，另一个 ARC 将提供与上述每个附加投票相关的附加详细信息。\n\n一旦这些投票决定了社区的决定并完成了当前的审计，社区投票通过的部署就可以开始了。\n\nV3 的特性使得首次执行完全受保护的发布成为可能，这意味着将在发布时对每个资产实施供应上限，以确保 V3 市场的安全和健康发布。\n\n### 结论\n\n该 ARC 专注于 Aave 协议的新迭代及其主要功能。如上所述，社区将决定发布计划的所有方面，包括发布 V3 的网络、Aave V3 的许可和漏洞赏金计划。\n\n我们迫不及待地想看看社区讨论什么并决定这项激动人心的新技术发展！\n\n来源链接：[governance.aave.com](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-aave-v3/6035)", "timestamp": 1636166138, "digest":

{"id": "5mhg_fY2qX0Iu3Po_6-BCDa5P0lCkbaXlhAAtNOLrGg", "title": "探讨 NFT 的六个形态定位及相关监管政策", "body": "> 虽然我国从政策上并未给出 NFT 具体的定义及使用法规，但今年以来 NFT 迅速爆发的态势使得 NFT 合规化成为必然。\n\n**原文标题：《NFT 的六个形态定位及相关监管政策探讨》撰文：陈丽姗、黎颖恒、黄泽圆、郑乔丹、李嘉达**\n\n本文主要从政策上探讨 NFT。目前，我国并未在法律上对 NFT 做出定义及监管。鉴于 NFT 的存在形式多种多样，如数字画作、音乐、视频、文字、游戏道具等。本文将从 NFT 的存在形式出发，探讨各种相似形态产品的法律政策，给 NFT 在法律上可能发展的方向做出参考。\n\n### 区块链产品\n\n区块链是 NFT 的底层技术，NFT 是区块链的典型应用。需要注意的是，区块链凭借其透明、公开、可追溯、不可篡改等特性已成为数字经济时代最重要的基础技术之一，并已经上升到国家层面。而 NFT 虽然运用了区块链底层技术，但法律政策并未对 NFT 本身做出说明。\n\n早在 2019 年，发展区块链技术已经成为国家层面的战略。习近平总书记在中央政治局第十八次集体学习时就强调「要把区块链作为核心技术自主创新的重要突破口，明确主攻方向，加大投入力度，着力攻克一批关键核心技术，加快推动区块链技术和产业创新发展」。\n\n此外，各地政府也在不断提出各项支持性及监管性政策以助力区块链技术的发展。今年以来，区块链相关的政策继续被推出。3 月，区块链被写入《中华人民共和国国民经济和社会发展第十四个五年规划和 2035 年远景目标纲要》，规划提出打造数字经济新优势，加快推动数字产业化。推动区块链技术创新 , 以联盟链为重点发展区块链服务平台和金融科技、供应链管理、政务服务等领域应用方案 , 完善监管机制。\n\n6 月，工信部和网信办联合发布《关于加快推动区块链技术应用和产业发展的指导意见》，指出聚焦供应链管理、产品溯源、数据共享等实体经济领域，推动区块链融合应用，支撑行业数字化转型和产业高质量发展。推动区块链技术应用于政务服务、存证取证、智慧城市等公共服务领域，支撑公共服务透明化、平等化、精准化。\n\n从区块链信息服务的提供、使用、管理等的相关来看，国家互联网信息办公室 2019 年 1 月 10 日发布的《区块链信息服务管理规定》要求，区块链信息服务提供者需要进行备案，变更、终止服务应当办理变更或注销手续。服务提供者开发上线新产品、新应用、新功能应当按照有关规定进行安全评估。对违反《规定》者，将依据本规定和有关法律、行政法规予以相应的处罚；构成犯罪的，依法追究刑事责任。\n\n**相关政策文件**\n\n《关于加快推动区块链技术应用和产业发展的指导意见》\n\n《区块链信息服务管理规定》\n\n《辽宁省知识产权保护条例》\n\n《中华人民共和国国民经济和社会发展第十四个五年规划和 2035 年远景目标纲要》\n\n《网络安全法》\n\n《关于互联网法院审理案件若干问题的规定》\n\n### 虚拟货币\n\n代币可被分为同质化和非同质化两种，但二者有着本质的区别。同质化指代币间可以进行无差别的交换，比特币、以太坊都属于同质化代币。而 NFT 的非同质化特性使其区分于虚拟代币，NFT 承载的是附着于其上的实物或者数字资产的价值。在我国对虚拟货币的高压政策下，明确二者的区别非常重要。\n\n由于虚拟货币容易被利用进行洗钱等违法活动，且缺乏汇兑机制，容易引起通货膨胀和市场混乱。我国一直以来对虚拟货币采取打压的政策。早在 2013 年，人民银行等五部委发布《关于防范比特币风险的通知》，明确了比特币是一种特定的虚拟商品，不由货币当局发行，不具有法偿性与强制性，不具有与货币等同的法律地位，不能且不应作为货币在市场上流通使用。\n\n2017 年，通过发行虚拟代币的融资活动扰乱了市场秩序，人民银行等七部委联合发布《关于防范代币发行融资风险的公告》，立即叫停各类代币融资活动，要求任何组织和个人不得非法从事代币发行融资活动；加强代币融资交易平台的管理，禁止法定货币与代币、「虚拟货币」相互之间的兑换业务；要求各金融机构和非银行支付机构不得开展与代币发行融资交易相关的业务。\n\n今年 9 月，人民银行发布《关于进一步防范和处置虚拟货币交易炒作风险的通知》，进一步明确指出虚拟货币及虚拟货币相关活动的属性，明确提出应对虚拟货币交易炒作风险的工作机制，加强交易炒作风险的监管。该政策给了 NFT 警示，若依靠发币融资、炒作套利的模式发展，NFT 将步入虚拟货币的后尘。因此，明辨虚拟货币与 NFT 的区别非常关键，用虚拟货币的思路发展 NFT 的做法是错误的。\n\n**相关政策文件**\n\n《关于防范代币发行融资风险的公告》\n\n《关于防范比特币风险的通知》\n\n《关于进一步防范和处置虚拟货币交易炒作风险的通知》\n\n《关于防范以「虚拟货币」「区块链」名义进行非法集资的风险提示》\n\n《关于为新时代加快完善社会主义市场经济体制提供司法服务和保障的意见》\n\n### 虚拟资产 / 数字藏品\n\nNFT 通过人类的劳动产生，本身凝结了人类抽象的劳动力。与虚拟资产类似，NFT 支持对价转让、交易、产生收益，具备价值性。NFT 持有人可以占有、使用、处分、收益，具有可支配性。今年 10 月份，腾讯幻核 APP 与支付宝小程序「蚂蚁链粉丝粒」内页中，「NFT」字样全部消失，改为「数字藏品」。从这个切入点来说，往虚拟资产或者数字藏品靠拢或许是 NFT 在我国合规框架下可能的落地形式。\n\n虚拟资产是受法律保护的，根据《民法典》第一百二十七条的规定，法律对数据、网络虚拟财产的保护有规定的，依照其规定。据此，《民法典》明确了数据、网络虚拟财产被纳入民事财产权利的保护客体范围。\n\n在数字经济规模越来越占主导地位的今天，数字资产已经成为经济活动的重要组成部分。NFT 往数字藏品或者虚拟资产的方向发展或许是目前最稳妥的方式。目前，多省市已经出台「数字资产交易」相关政策。《宁波市加快区块链产业培育及创新应用三年行动计划（2020-2022 年）》提出探索建立区块链监管机制，重点加强区块链在金融、数字资产交易、电子政务、个人数据保护等领域的行业监管治理机制；\n\n2020 年 5 月发布的《海南省关于加快区块链产业发展的若干政策措施》中指出，支持龙头企业探索数字资产交易平台建设，探索资产数字化、数字资产确权保护、数字资产全球化流动、数字资产交易等方面的标准和技术模式，推动数字资产相关业态在海南先行先试。\n\n《2020 年成都政府工作报告》中表示，加快推进区块链知识产权质押融资服务平台建设，推动设立数字资产交易中心，扎实推进法定数字货币试点。\n\n**相关政策文件**\n\n《民法典》\n\n《宁波市加快区块链产业培育及创新应用三年行动计划（2020-2022 年）》\n\n《海南省关于加快区块链产业发展的若干政策措施》\n\n《著作权法》\n\n### 艺术品\n\n数字艺术品是 NFT 最主要的存在形式。目前，创造艺术品 NFT 一般有两种方式，一是直接在线创造并形成 NFT 艺术品，二是将线下实物艺术品铸造成为 NFT 艺术品。从 NFT 艺术品的法律性质上看，NFT 艺术品本质上是一种数字形式呈现的作品。从 NFT 艺术品区块链存证的法律效力上看，其本质也是一种存储于区块链网络的电子数据。从 NFT 实物艺术品铸造权益上看，NFT 艺术品与艺术品作者、藏家、用户权益的关系相关。\n\n从艺术品的定义看，《艺术品经营管理办法》第二条第一款规定：「本办法所称艺术品，是指绘画作品、书法篆刻作品、雕塑雕刻作品、艺术摄影作品、装置艺术作品、工艺美术作品等及上述作品的有限复制品。本办法所称艺术品不包括文物。」据此，目前 NFT 并不属于艺术品范畴。\n\n有趣的是，NFT 还未大规模兴起时，一群先行艺术家就利用其探索发展数字化艺术品的可能性。对于部分艺术品 NFT，从艺术品的法规做出规定对数字经济时代的艺术创作有积极且深刻的意义。\n\n**相关政策文件**\n\n《艺术品经营管理办法》\n\n《中华人民共和国著作权法》\n\n《数据安全法》\n\n### 网络出版物\n\n网络出版物的丰富多样性与 NFT 相似，且其表现形式都是数字化作品，但二者并不相同。需要注意的是，目前 NFT 并不等于数字作品，甚至不等于数字作品的存证，其只是数字复制品在链上的一种密码学表达。\n\n从形式上，目前 NFT 最接近于网络出版物。根据《网络出版服务管理规定》，网络出版物指通过信息网络向公众提供的，具有编辑、制作、加工等出版特征的数字化作品，范围主要包括：\n\n（一）文学、艺术、科学等领域内具有知识性、思想性的文字、图片、地图、游戏、动漫、音视频读物等原创数字化作品；\n\n（二）与已出版的图书、报纸、期刊、音像制品、电子出版物等内容相一致的数字化作品；\n\n（三）将上述作品通过选择、编排、汇集等方式形成的网络文献数据库等数字化作品；\n\n（四）国家新闻出版广电总局认定的其他类型的数字化作品。\n\n从操作层面上，法律对网络出版物的生成与流通做出了政策性的规范。根据《网络出版服务管理规定》第七条的规定，从事网络出版服务，必须依法经过出版行政主管部门批准，取得《网络出版服务许可证》。」根据《中华人民共和国网络安全法》第二十二条规定，网络产品、服务具有收集用户信息功能的，其提供者应当向用户明示并取得同意。\n\n**相关政策文件**\n\n《出版物市场管理规定》\n\n《网络出版服务管理规定》\n\n《互联网信息服务管理办法》\n\n《中华人民共和国著作权法》\n\n《中华人民共和国著作权法实施条例》\n\n《计算机软件保护条例》\n\n《著作权集体管理条例》\n\n《信息网络传播权保护条例》\n\n《广播电台电视台播放录音制品支付报酬管理办法》\n\n### 游戏装备\n\n游戏领域也是 NFT 最典型的应用，其中包括最早兴起的收藏游戏如 Cryptokitties。但目前更丰富的玩法已经出现在多款游戏上，如模拟经营游戏 The Sandbox，赛车竞技游戏 Battle Racers，甚至还有流动性挖矿的 NFT 版本，比如 Axie Infinity。NFT 化的游戏装备使得这些游戏更有「现实」感，甚至出现依靠玩游戏养家糊口的现象。\n\n目前，与网络游戏虚拟货币交易相关的规定主要集中在已废止的文化部制定的文件中，如已废止的《网络游戏暂行管理办法》中规定从事网络游戏虚拟货币交易服务应取得《网络文化经营许可证》、《文化部关于加强网络游戏宣传推广活动监管的通知》规定，网络游戏运营企业不得向用户提供网络游戏虚拟货币、虚拟道具兑换法定货币或者实物的服务。\n\n目前，现行有效的法规等并无直接针对网络游戏相关的资产以及虚拟货币的规定。在司法实践中，部分网络账号、装备盗窃的情况下，法院认为盗窃网络游戏虚拟货币的行为以非法获取计算机信息系统数据罪定罪量刑。部分法院认为，公民能够独占管理的，可以转移处置的，具有价值性的物（包括无形物），均可以认定为公民私人所有的财产，网络游戏装备及虚拟货币等属于虚拟财产。从这个观点出发，网络游戏内的虚拟货币和装备等具有价值的内容成为虚拟财产是一个趋势。\n\n**相关政策文件**\n\n《民法典》\n\n《网络游戏暂行管理办法》（已废止）\n\n《网络文化经营许可证》\n\n《文化部关于加强网络游戏宣传推广活动监管的通知》\n\n### NFT 行业标准\n\n目前，虽然我国从政策上并未给出 NFT 具体的定义及使用法规，但今年以来 NFT 迅速爆发的态势和疯狂生长的局面使得 NFT 合规化成为必然。目前，各机构和企业正在积极的建立 NFT 的相关标准。\n\n9 月份，科技部下属中国技术市场协会标准化工作委员会联合多家产学研机构成立工作组，共同开展《 NFT 平台与产品评测》团体标准研制、起草工作。旨在进一步探索知识产权领域的数字化转型与数字科技应用，尽快建立起一套适合中国国情、满足国内 NFT 行业长期健康发展需要的相关团体标准。\n\n「加快 NFT 相关标准研制已成为行业共识。」\n\n——中国技术市场协会副秘书长王兵\n\n10 月份，NFT 行业首个自律公约发布。国家版权交易中心联盟牵头，中国美术学院、浙江省杭州互联网公证处、蚂蚁集团、京东科技、腾讯云等共同发布《数字文创行业自律公约》，旨在强化行业自律，建立良性的数字文创行业发展生态，助力中国文创产业发展。\n\n《公约》指出，要坚守区块链技术服务数字文创产业发展初心，为数字文创作品确权及流转提供创新解决方案，让创作者的作品能更好触达市场，促进原创文化行业繁荣发展。充分运用区块链技术保护链上数字文创作品版权，保护创作者合理权益。其中，抵制炒作是《公约》的重要共识。\n\n「通过《公约》的发布和实施，希望有更多的机构与社会力量参与到数字文创行业的规范发展中来，共同为文化产业发展营造干净、公平、健康的发展环境。」\n\n——国家版权交易中心联盟理事长李蘅",

带来第二春吗？》撰文：汤圆**\n\n近日，自动化做市商（AMM）应用 Osmosis 获得 2100 万美元投资，由著名的加密风险投资机构 Paradigm 领投，该应用基于 Cosmos 搭建。这条融资新闻出来之后，区块链网络 Cosmos 又成为各大社群讨论的热点，人们开始重新审视这个沉寂已久的老牌公链。\n\n在 DeFi 应用爆发期内，Cosmos 作为老牌公链代表并未出现爆款应用，其链上 TVL 相较于 Solana、BSC、Fantom 等新生公链也没有优势，但它仍为应用方和资本所青睐，这又是为何？相比其它公链，它有何优势与劣势？本期 DeFi 蜂窝将盘点 Cosmos 的技术概念及生态进展。\n\n### Cosmos 的底层支撑\n\n![速览 Cosmos 生态进展：跨链技术能带来第二春吗？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/e163f1ca34573aac68ad019cfb3206f7.jpg-article)\n\nCosmos 是一个由多条独立运行的平行区块链组成的去中心化网络，它是基础区块链网络的底层系统之一，在这个系统中，有多条采用了 Tendermint 共识算法的区块链并行运转，链与链之间相互独立，但在一定的条件下，链与链之间可以产生联系。\n\nCosmos 区块链网络系统有三大核心板块构成，分别是 Tendermint 共识、Cosmos SDK、IBC （跨链通信协议）。\n\n* Tendermint 共识算法——Cosmos 网络使用一种通用区块链开发框架，在此框架下开发的区块链网络都具有共同算法，数据格式相同且可互通。\n\n早在 2014 年，研发团队就意识到比特币和以太坊的 PoW （工作量证明）共识算法存在不足，希望能创造一种不依赖于挖矿这种高电力消耗的共识算法，且这种新算法能在保证网络安全的前提下，提升链上的处理速度和可扩展性。\n\nTendermint 框架专门形成了相应的软件，这个软件能够帮助网络复制应用程序，并保障应用程序的安全和数据的一致性。\n\n* CosmosSDK——它是 Cosmos 为开发者提供的开发模板工具，它把区块链中的一些通用开发技术标准化、模块化，开发者只需在模板（SDK）基础上进行调整或更换部分内容，即可完成一条链的开发。Cosmos SDK 的目标是希望开发者能轻松地构建和自定义区块链。\n\n难得的是，Cosmos SDK 支持开发者构建多种 PoS （权益证明）共识算法的区块链网络，开发者可以根据自己的需求定制 Cosmos-SDK 模块，然后将模块内容导入新生的区块链应用中，与原有的网络模块融为一体。我们所熟知的稳定币生态 Terra （LUNA）和跨链资产交易应用 Torchain （RUNE）都是基于 Cosmos-SDK 工具开发的。\n\n* 跨链通信协议 IBC （Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol）—它是 Cosmos 网络核心协议接口，通过它能够实现区块网络链与链之间的信息传递，允许区块链读取和验证其它链上的数据。Cosmos 生态内的多条区块链之间的联系即通过 IBC 同步。\n\n例如：A 链和 B 链之间有 IBC 接口，A 链上的智能合约就可以知道 B 链上发生的数据事实，而 B 链上的智能合约需要采用 A 链上存储区块信息的块头，并验证其数据和时间的最终性。\n\n近期，Terra 链社区出现了关于上线 IBC 的提案。如果 Terra 链最终上线了 IBC 接口，那么，Terra 链上的 LUNA、稳定币 UST、ANC 等资产及相关数据信息就可以无缝移植到 Cosmos 链上。\n\n### Cosmos 网络的运转机制\n\n![速览 Cosmos 生态进展：跨链技术能带来第二春吗？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/e163f1ca34573aac68ad019cfb3206f7.jpg-article)\n\n相较于以太坊这样的单独的区块链链条，Cosmos 正在构建由多链条组成的链网体系，在这里，新区块链可以轻易创建，每条链的共识算法都统一为 Tendermint 共识，各个链独立并行运转，通过 IBC 来实现链上资产在不同链之间的转移。\n\nCosmos 提出一种设想——每个 DApp 都运行在自己的区块链上，而 Cosmos 通过协议来连接所有这些链及链上应用，然后形成「区块链互联网」。\n\n在 Cosmos 生态中到底如何实现链与链之间的信息共享呢？运转方式是如何的呢？我们知道在 Cosmos 网络可以基于 IBC 协议实现链链交互功能，那么是每条链与链之间都需要接入 IBC 协议接口吗？\n\n其实，在 Cosmos 网络中，区块链形成了一种中心辐射模型，位于中心的是 Hub 中心枢纽，Hub 管理着许多被称为「Zone」的独立分支链，它可以追踪记录各个 Zone 的状态，而每个 Zone 会把自身区块的情况汇报给 Hub 并同步其状态。\n\nHub 与 Zone 直接通信，而 Zone 与 Zone 之间通过 IBC 间接通信。当 Zone 与 Hub 建立 IBC 连接时，它就可以自动访问其他连接到该 Hub 上的 Zone。\n\n![速览 Cosmos 生态进展：跨链技术能带来第二春吗？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/4499efcf10aa04e2c18954396e9a3757.jpg-article)\n\n你可以把 Hub 理解为一个「港口」，而 Zone 是各航线上行使的「船只」，IBC 是进入 Hub 港口共享信息的「门票」。一只船通过门票进入到这个港口中，就可以享受到其他船只上的各种信息，无需让每条船之间单独联系。\n\n在 Cosmos 网络中，其中心枢纽 Hub 直接取名为「Cosmos Hub」，充当其网络分支区块链的中央连接点，其它独立区块链 Zone 以分支的形式连接到 Cosmos Hub 上。\n\nATOM 就是 Cosmos Hub 的原生 Token，质押 ATOM 可以做网络的验证节点，该 Token 也是链上投票治理的重要工具。ATOM 当前市值为 109 亿美元，在整个加密资产市场中排名 22 位。\n\nCosmos 无疑为 DApp 的开发搭建了一个非常友好的开发环境——开发者无需浪费过多时间和精力，就可以针对应用的底层需求去创建一条专属的区块链。\n\n而对于用户来说，操作流程繁琐带来了体验的不友好，因为在该生态中，每个 DApp 都有一条独立的区块链，用户使用不同的应用时，不但得切换链，充提加密资产以及在各个应用中转移加密资产，都得通过 IBC 这道流程。\n\n对于开发者来说，环境是友好了，开发是便捷了，但应用程序之间的链接却变得疏远了。此外，相比维护一个 DApp 的运营，维护一条链运转成本相对较高，需要人力技术和财务力量的不断投入，这就给开发者带来了成本上的压力。\n\n要知道，当前 DeFi 需要「乐高组合」来形成 DApp 及资产间的流通，以及加密收益的扩大化，Cosmos 对当前的市场需求没有形成足够的吸引力，这大概也是其整体 TVL 没有在这波 DeFi 风暴中增长的原因。而一个可喜的趋势是，Cosmos 正在以应用的方式解决生态内链与链之间的壁垒问题。\n\n### Cosmos 的生态应用\n\n#### 去中心化交易所 Gravity DEX\n\n**简介**\n\nGravity DEX 是 Cosmos Hub 主网上的首个原生去中心化交易应用，由 Cosmos 开发公司 Tendermint 及其收购的 Cosmos 信息提供商和节点验证人 B-Harvest 共同创建。\n\n该 DEX 基于跨链通信协议 IBC 创建，支持 Cosmos 原生 Token 及其链接的多链资产 Token 的发行、兑换、交易、组建流动性资产池，这些操作都无需跨桥。比如，Terra 就是 Cosmos Hub 链接的一个 Zone，发行了自己的生态 Token LUNA。Gravity DEX 就支持 ATOM 和 Terra 链上的 LUNA 、UST、ANC 等资产间的兑换，也支持用户在该 DEX 上组成 ATOM-UST 等流动性池 LP。\n\n![速览 Cosmos 生态进展：跨链技术能带来第二春吗？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/f2d213e94e728768a85d708daca99eac.jpg-article)\n\n**运营机制**\n\n相较于传统的 DEX，Gravity DEX 在技术上做了改进，允许用户在交易时根据自己的价格进行交易，并能确保看到的价格就是交易所能得到的价格。\n\n以 Uniswap 为例，该 DEX 的交易订单按顺序执行，以太坊矿工可以根据交易方给付的矿工费高低来选择先打包哪些交易，当然，正常的矿工都会优先处理给付矿工费高的交易，但这就导致了大额交易会被技术流的「科学家」们抢跑或挤夹，最终给普通用户带来极高的滑点损失，也给订单带来了夸张的价差。\n\n而 Gravity DEX 使用了批量执行交易来抵御抢先交易或价格操纵的可能。批量执行交易订单，意味着同一区块中的订单会同时处理，从根本上消除了抢跑的机会。\n\n根据 Gravity DEX 官网数据显示，测试阶段发生的交易有 71 万笔，使用的交易用户有 2 万多人，在资金池中锁仓的资金额（TVL）达 1.9 亿美元。\n\n#### 一站式 DeFi 应用入口 Emeris\n\n**简介**\n\nEmeris 是 Cosmos 开发公司 Tendermint 推出的 Cosmos 生态一站式 DeFi 应用入口，目前该应用集合了 DEX 及 Cosmos 生态内的原生资产管理功能。未来还将成为用户进入 Cosmos 生态应用的一站式资产管理平台，以方便用户在 Emeris 上集中管理多条链上的资产。\n\nEmeris 集合了 GravityDEX 的功能，用户可以在 Emeris 上直接完成 Cosmos 生态内多链资产的兑换及交易，无需再跳转至 Gravity DEX 页面。\n\nEmeris 还提供了资产仪表盘，可以实时显示 Cosmos 生态的资产价格，用户钱包中的所有资产及分布情况也实现了可视化，用户可以根据资产收益率随时调整自己的持仓策略，管理自己的多链资产。\n\n![速览 Cosmos 生态进展：跨链技术能带来第二春吗？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/3727efa33f221f36cf972276795911ad.jpg-article)\n\n目前，Emeris 测试版已经上线，用户可以通过多链钱包 Keplr 进入此应用。用户体验此应用时，钱包中需要一定数量的 ATOM。Emeris 应用还支持用户用信用卡购买 ATOM。需要注意的是，Emeris 尚未发行任何通证。\n\n#### 链接以太坊的桥梁 Cosmos Gravity Bridge\n\n**简介**\n\nCosmosGravity Bridge 是专为 Cosmos Hub 设计的以太坊至 Cosmos 的资产跨链桥，该桥就链接了 IBC，允许基于 Cosmos 搭建的多链网络通过该桥桥接以太坊的 ERC-20 标准资产。\n\n![速览 Cosmos 生态进展：跨链技术能带来第二春吗？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/9a9de13c2b4636ba3b67c201c24c87e6.jpg-article)\n\nGravity Bridg 由 Althea 团队创建，主要目的是解决 Cosmos 网络与以太坊 Layer 1 公链之间的资产互通及转移问题。\n\n与常见的跨链桥不同，Gravity Bridge 以一个独立的区块链在运转，将为 Cosmos Hub 和整个 Cosmos 生态系统提供资产的流动性。\n\nGravity Bridge 还是一个双向跨链桥，不但可以将 ERC-20 资产（如 WETH、DAI、USDC、WBTC 等）从以太坊带入到 Cosmos 生态中，也能将 Cosmos 生态内的资产带入到以太坊网络上。未来，Gravity Bridge 还会将其他兼容以太坊的链上资产注入到 Cosmos 生态中。\n\n这也就意味着，Cosmos 生态内将与其他区块链打通，资产将可以在更广阔、多样的应用中流通。需要注意的是，目前 Gravity Bridge 桥也未发行任何通证，其主网发布时间为 11 月 8 日。\n\n#### 自动化做市商 (AMM)Osmosis\n\n**简介**\n\nOsmosis 是拥有高级自动化做市商（AMM）的去中心化交易应用，它用 Cosmos SDK 构建了一条独立区块链，允许开发人员根据自己的需求设计、构建和部署他们自己定制的 AMM 策略。\n\n![速览 Cosmos 生态进展：跨链技术能带来第二春吗？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/29d884a679bdd20ca8eaa0354b390a0b.jpg-article)\n\n在 Osmosis 中，AMM 的底层结构可以更改，开发者能根据资产的交易需求随时调整及更改兑换资产的权重参数等。简单理解就是，Osmosis 为开发者搭建了一个 AMM 去中心化交易的应用模板，开发者只需根据自己的需求填充内容即可，无需再费时费力搭建一个专属的 AMM 应用。\n\nOsmosis 内置了 IBC，这就让它可以连接 Cosmos 生态系统内的原生资产，后期借助跨链桥 Gravity Bridge，还可以整合基于以太坊的 ERC-20 资产。\n\n目前，Osmosis 支持 Cosmos 生态系统内的多链资产兑换及交易，用户可以通过多链钱包 Keplr 进入此应用，为 ATOM-OSMO 及 Cosmos 生态内的资产提供流动性，以获取 OSMO 奖励。OSMO 为 Osmosis 的原生通证，发行总量为 10 亿个，目前暂报为 5.6 美元。", "timestamp": 1636166335, "digest": "juGAVcJzrv3PGstRQ8xoMn41p8VthhDQycN2Q5L1kAE",

系列潜在价值的预估、对整个市场趋势的预测、找到潜在买家就成为了一个至关重要的问题。目前，对 NFT 玩家们来说，判断一个项目值不值得去参与 Gas war，抢到了之后又何时出手，是最大的两个难题。\n\n但有一种捷径——巨鲸追踪。\n\n数字经济时代，用户可能刻意地隐藏自己的地址。但是，也有一部分人会用固定的地址，即便被人发现也不会更换。比如 V 神的地址、SBF 种地的地址，几乎都是公开的。一方面可以视为他们对社区的信任。另外一个不容忽视的是，保持地址固定对于提升这些人的辨识度很有帮助。尤其是，将 ETH 地址、ENS 地址、推特账号以及 Opensea 地址设置成统一地址，效果更好。找到 NFT 巨鲸之后，持续追踪他们的地址，或者关注他们在社交账号的发言，对于用户参与 NFT 市场具有一定的指导意义。\n\n###

Chitra，Gauntlet 的创始人兼 CEO编译：YangZ**\n\n随着 DeFi 和 NFT 社区规模的巨大增长，如何治理去中心化协议就显得更加重要。现在和未来几年，这些社区面临的最直接的挑战之一是弄清楚治理，也就是管理集体决策的行为，以优化资金和运营。\n\n然而，治理需要大量的协调成本，因为需要让网络参与者参与每个决策的投票。在新型的去中心化网络中，这些协调成本可以从根本上减少，在这种网络中，智能合约使参与者能够以合作的方式进行治理。\n\n这些新的网络被称为 DAO （去中心化自治组织）--人们带着一致的激励和共同的利益走到一起，没有领导者或单点故障，几乎完全由代码运行。许多新的协议正在使用这种结构建立，到目前为止，大部分活动都基于开放金融的系统，但也有越来越多的文化网络在购买和交易艺术品和其他收藏品。在许多方面，DAO 可以被看作是投资银行、公司和社会俱乐部的混合体，通过加密承诺缝合在一起。\n\n尽管被叫做去中心化自治组织，但 DAO 通常不是完全自主的--需要有人建立决策框架，以确保 DAO 得到有效的治理，并在财政上激励网络参与者参与，以便 DAO 能够成长。\n\n那么，迎接 DAO 创建者和参与者的有哪些问题？需要做出哪些决定？可以使用什么样的金融激励措施？应该在什么条件下组建 DAO？今天需要的主要治理任务是什么？以及可以使用哪些工具来帮助治理？\n\n在回答这些问题之前，我们先问另一个问题--我们是如何走到这里的？- 并简要地探讨一下 DAO 的发展。这将使我们看到去中心化结构在过去的半个月里是如何形成和变化的，有助于解释为什么金融激励是 DAO 治理时代到来的一个关键因素。\n\n### 早期实验为现代 DAO 铺平了道路\n\n世界第一次听说这些互联网原生组织是在 2016 年。最著名的早期 DAO 被称为「The DAO」，它是一种集体投资工具，旨在成为一种理性主义的众筹形式--一种去中心化的风险基金--并首次展示了这种通过代码运行的去中心化组织如何自我管理。参与者向 The DAO 提供 ETH 并获得 DAO 代币。这些代币代表持有人在 DAO 中的经济利益和投票权。\n\nThe DAO 的目标是让任何参与者--无论他们对金库的贡献有多少--都能在以太坊生态系统中获得奖励。但是，一个关键的智能合约漏洞导致 The DAO 合约中的资金被攻击者抽走。紧接着，DAO 这个词也就不受欢迎了，且导致了「DAO 冬天」的出现，而这恰恰是 2017 年后的熊市。\n\n随着期望值的降低和关注度的下降，这一时期的一些重要的治理实验为现代 DAO 铺平了道路。其中第一个解决了安全问题--如果用户担心他们的资金会消失，任何网络都无法运作，更不用说发展了。首先，以太坊的竞争对手，如 Tezos，承诺了更安全的智能合约编程语言，这将使开发者很容易避免 DAO 的问题。在以太坊上，出现了一些实验，如 Aragon、dxDAO、Kleros 和 Moloch。这些 DAO 的实现为这个领域带来了更好的编程标准和新的代币分配机制的实验。\n\n随着安全问题的减少，早期 DAO 共同面临的最大问题是，无法找到一种激励模式来鼓励人们高度参与 DAO 事务。如果没有具有做出明智决定所需的专业知识的选民参与，DAO 的治理就会停滞不前。\n\n### 金融激励机制的兴起\n\n近年来，DeFi 的兴起为更复杂的开放金融系统和不依赖银行和其他传统系统的工具打开了大门。新的 DAO 开始出现，并使用金融激励措施来鼓励参与这些系统。\n\n这些激励措施，以及它们相互建立的方式，已经成为 DAO 治理的关键--如果没有经济激励，网络成员就没有理由将他们的时间、金钱和精力投入网络，对改进网络的提案进行投票，或者根本不关心它们的持续增长和成功。\n\n这里有几种类型的激励措施，以及它们形成过程中的一些关键事件，以帮助建设者了解我们是如何走到这一步的，什么时候需要 DAO，激励措施对治理是如何的关键，以及有效治理 DAO 的策略。\n\n#### 增长激励\n\n一个重要的发展是在 2020 年 6 月，即链上借贷协议 Compound 将自己去中心化了--其核心开发人员将网络的运作和所有权移交给社区。与之前的 DAO 不同，Compound 的治理 DAO 让社区成员控制协议的储备资产，而这些资产是通过借款人的费用产生的。这些现金流是（当时）链上协议所产生的最高收入。\n\nCompound 提出了一种新颖的代币分配模式，旨在激励协议内的资本增长，并为用户提供更好的贷款定价。这种模式涉及到向协议提供流动性并从协议中获得贷款的用户持续分配 Compound 的原生代币（COMP）。随后，Compound 的每个用户立即成为了利益相关者，其中一些人也成为了积极的贡献者和投票者。\n\n这些财务激励措施对于控制关键参数（如保证金要求和利率）至关重要。Compound 的分配措施提供了去中心化梦想的一瞥--由协议的用户控制协议（和它的现金流）。由于 Compound 协议有数十亿美元的资产和留置权需要治理，新型 DAO 的基本设置已经确定，即参与者有明确的理由用他们的时间、资产和投票为网络的最佳利益而行动，因为网络的增长和成功可以使他们个人受益。\n\n#### 收益耕种\n\n治理代币分配的发展，为协议用户，而不仅仅是投资者和开发团队，创造了许多新模式的设计空间。首先是在协议上创建各种激励行动--「收益耕种」。收益耕种发生在用户因执行借贷、抵押或提供其他形式的资产流动性等行为而获得奖励时--奖励以代币的形式出现，代表协议本身的一部分所有权。接受者可以积累这种所有权，指望协议的价值上升，或者他们可以在公开市场上出售它，使他们的行动复合化，从而增加收益。想象一下，如果各大银行在你每次存款时都给你一小股股票--那么你会更愿意存款，因为这对你和银行都有好处。\n\n例如，Compound 的用户可以通过在协议中锁定他们的资本（即通过借款和贷款将其作为抵押物在协议中进行交易）并赚取计价的 DAO 治理代币来实现一种收益。通过这种方式，Compound 能够使用 COMP 来激励增长，并创造一个用户群，激励他们对协议进行投票和贡献，因为收益的承诺吸引了更多的用户。\n\n开发者一意识到他们可以通过收益耕种来吸引资本进入新的 DeFi 基元，2020 年的整个夏天就出现了一场竞赛，即通过 DAO 治理代币分配来发展 DeFi 协议。这个夏天的增长催化剂是 DeFi 收益率聚合器 Yearn Finance （YFI）的推出，其 「公平分配」（所有代币都分配给资本提供者，没有分配给开发者），将叙事从 VC 资助的项目转向社区资助的项目。而 YFI 一启动并实现了快速增长，许多竞争者也推出了克隆和山寨产品，承诺略有改进，但更重要的是，新的 DAO 治理代币的推出。\n\nYFI 表明，仅治理的承诺就可以引导网络的采用。公平启动模式，以及它使用初始代币分配来锁定理想的未来用户，从那时起就已经变得非常普遍。\n\n#### 追溯性空投\n\n新的协议建立在这些模式之上，以进一步激励用户。一个突出的例子是空投，或将代币交付给当前或以前的用户，以传播意识，建立所有权，或追溯奖励早期用户。例如，去中心化交易协议 Uniswap 推出了 UNI 代币，并追溯性地空投给了每个曾经使用过 Uniswap 协议的人。这个空投导致一些早期用户赚取了价值数千万美元的 UNI。\n\n更重要的是，空投和代币发行被证明是一种有效的资本保护武器，很快就成为了希望获得市场份额的新 DeFi 协议的必要条件。\n\n代币发行量的增加也导致了治理权力的变化--早期用户不知道他们的参与会催生治理权，他们开始拥有网络的重要部分，从而促进了更大的去中心化。\n\n追溯性空投成为了增加代币发行和活跃用户的治理参与的工具。\n\n### 文化 DAO 和游戏公会\n\n上面概述的金融激励机制的发展促成了 DeFi 协议在过去一年的指数式增长。然而，其他类型的 DAO 也在不断出现，具有不同的文化、激励模式和治理结构。最近，我们看到了具有代币分配模式的 DAO 的崛起，（与 DeFi DAO 不同）不与使用或参与挂钩。\n\n这些是收藏家 DAO，由决定集体购买艺术品或其他数字项目的人组成。其中的一个例子是 PleasrDAO，它是在 pplpleasr （即 Emily Yang）为 Uniswap V3 的推出而创作纪念视频后成立的（我是 PleasrDAO 的创始成员）。那段视频被视为是捕捉 2020 年 DeFi 精神的标志性艺术。当时，该视频被铸造成了 NFT，并进行了拍卖，所得款项用于慈善。而这次拍卖和围绕艺术品的集体精神便引发了一些长期 DeFi 开发者和企业家想要创建 DAO 来购买艺术品的想法。\n\nPleasrDAO 的进步是一种独特的 NFT 碎片化机制，使集体拥有一件艺术品的可行性大大增加。这个愿景将 DAO 描绘成一个艺术博物馆，就像 MoMA 一样，尽管博物馆里的所有作品都可以由赞助人集体拥有。\n\n另一个具有文化意义的收藏家 DAO，产生于 2020 年秋季，即 FingerprintsDAO （我是它的成员）。与 PleasrDAO 不同，FingerprintsDAO 专注于建立一个生成艺术和链上艺术的收藏。基于 NFT 的生成艺术的独特之处在于，它允许艺术品在每次所有权改变时发生变化--例如，$HASH （美丽的证明）这样的艺术品，其底层元数据在每次艺术品被转移时都会作为区块链状态的函数随机改变。FingerprintsDAO 收集此类艺术品，并拥有一些最大的 Autoglyphs、Bitchcoins 和 0xDEAFBEEF 的收藏。\n\nFingerprintsDAO 和 PleasrDAO 利用他们的 DAO 治理代币来管理他们的资金库，进行资产销售（包括碎片化的收益），并用于资产策划。DAO 代币持有者有权对这些问题进行投票，在许多情况下，这些投票的结果直接在链上使用 DeFi 协议执行，如 Fractional 或 Uniswap。\n\n由于收藏家 DAO 代币的分配并不与使用或参与挂钩--而且财务激励并不像通常的 DeFi DAO 那样一致--这可能导致早期 DAO 组织者承担越来越大的承诺，以保持 DAO 的有效运作及 DAO 成员之间复杂的动态。这种一致性挑战是文化 DAO 所特有的，（因此）这个领域的建设者应该使用不同类型的治理策略来保持 DAO 的有效运行。\n\n一种方法是收藏家 DAO 雇用全职工程师和产品经理，他们直接使用 DAO 治理代币进行激励（同时确保这种组织结构保持 DAO 的去中心化治理和运作）。通过确保那些为 DAO 工作的人能够在 DAO 的资产中获得越来越多的份额，人们可以在早期代币持有者和从事 DAO 日常管理的人之间建立一个稳定的平衡。\n\n最后一种类型的 DAO，有自己的文化、激励模式和治理结构，即游戏公会--DAO 形式的游戏家族（基本上是以团队形式进行游戏的玩家群体）的简化版。这些去中心化的公会集体拥有游戏物品和 / 或收藏品，并在出售时分享其使用和收益。\n\n与传统的玩家公会不同，在《Axie Infinity》等游戏中发现的游戏盈利机制可以鼓励参与者之间的合作策略和收益分享。这些机制使它们更像 DeFi DAO--参与网络可以获得奖励，同时也能促进网络的发展前景--但在这一点上，网络的治理与纯粹的财务指标关系不大，而与游戏表现和社会指标关系更大。这些 DAO 很值得关注，因为随着它们的发展，它们可能会找到新的机制，以其他 DAO 没有使用过的方式增加其去中心化。\n\n### 什么时候需要 DAO\n\nDAO 的普遍增长和一些最具创新性的 DAO 的巨大成功，不可避免地导致人们认为增长和强大的网络参与的路线需要一个 DAO 结构。在热情高涨的时候，市场力量使人们很容易认为每个组织、社区或项目都需要一个 DAO，就像我们在 2017 年 ICO 热潮中看到的加密代币一样。\n\n但这不一定是真的。当与策展、安全和风险有关的治理负担可以比伴随着需要让成员参与投票的每一个决策而自然增加的协调成本更快地减少时，DAO 的工作效果最好。这就是为什么协议建设者在决定是否组建 DAO 时，必须评估组织的真正目标。\n\n所有 DAO 共同的治理领域是 :\n\n* 集体资产所有权和管理。DAO 的金库和资产负债表应该像去中心化的公司一样运作，考虑资产和负债、流动性、收入以及在哪里分配财政资源。\n* 资产的风险管理。波动性、价格和其他市场条件需要持续监测。\n* 资产策划。从收集的艺术品到借贷的抵押品，所有 DAO 资产都受益于围绕策划的目标和过程。\n\n只有在明确所有这些治理领域都是社区所需要的情况下，人们才应该组建 DAO。\n\n值得注意的是，虽然 DAO 可能专注于这些活动的一个子集，但它确实需要提供所有这三种功能。例如，假设一个文化 DAO 拥有一项资产，它突然有机会从中获得收益或产出。那么即使 DAO 在这之前完全忽略了风险管理（例如只专注于资产策展），它在这种销售时也会面临这种挑战。\n\n这种事件最突出的例子之一是 PleasrDAO 以 2.25 亿美元出售 $DOG 代币，它代表了原始 Dogecoin meme NFT 中的部分所有权。在这之前，PleasrDAO 只专注于资产策划，而忽略了风险管理的问题。通过 Sushi 的 Miso 平台推出代币，迫使该小组学习不同的代币分配机制和经济学，特别是由于碎片化的 NFT 市场结构刚刚起步。该小组还必须通过设立社区发展基金，确保社区成员对 NFT 有真正的所有权。\n\n这里的关键教训是，DAO 需要随着其活动的变化而增加新的集体技能和治理过程，而且成功的 DAO 将迅速认识到自己的缺点。\n\n### 三个关键的治理领域\n\n成长中的 DAO 可能会达到这样的程度：他们的社区需要所有三个关键需求的治理结构。下面，我分享了对每一个领域的更详细的细分，以帮助建设者 / 协议开发者清楚地确定如果他们想建立一个成功的 DAO，他们需要将重点放在哪里。\n\n#### 集体资产管理\n\n所有 DAO 都有一些初始资本，以 DAO 智能合约持有的治理代币和用于购买治理代币的资产的形式持有。例如，如果一个 DAO 开始时铸造了 1000 个治理代币，并将其中的 500 个代币以 100 个 ETH 的价格出售给创世成员，那么这个 DAO 的初始资金库就包括 500 个治理代币和 100 个 ETH。然而，随着 DAO 在用户或累积现金流方面的增长（如 Compound），社区管理他们的资本变得很重要，就像公司一样，因为公司治理的最佳实践很适合 DAO，但与此同时增加的困难是隐私的减少。\n\n#### 风险管理\n\n由于 DAO 的资产负债表通常是由风险资产组成的，管理 DAO 的货币风险以确保未来的运营能够得到资助变得越来越重要。一些 DeFi 和 NFT DAO 拥有由数亿或数十亿美元资产组成的资金库。这些资产旨在用于资助开发和审计，在底层协议失败时提供保险，并用于用户增长和收购的支出。为了实现这些目标，DAO 需要管理资金库，以满足特定的指标或关键绩效指标（KPI），例如，我们能否在资产价格下降 95% 的情况下生存下来？「或」如果我们在持有的资产上获得 X% 的利息，我们还能购买高价值的 NFT 吗？\n\n这里有一个最近的例子，以说明这在实践中的情况。Aave 是一个去中心化的货币市场协议，其网络参与者上周发现了在协议内使用 xSushi 作为抵押品的潜在漏洞，原因是预言机的错误定价问题（在 CREAM Finance 中被利用了 1.3 亿美元）。Gauntlet 进行了模拟，以评估威胁，并发现在目前的市场条件下，潜在的攻击者将无法成功操纵该货币。作为一项额外的预防措施，Gauntlet 在 Aave 治理中提出了一项建议，禁止某些类型的借款以减轻风险，而该建议得到了参与者的压倒性赞同。(Aave 的 DAO 是 Gauntlet 的一个客户）\n\n![为何治理和激励对 DAO 构建及运行很重要？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/2b84450e114f5f2fbdded5e7d787a1b5_a5qaktl.png-article)\n\n在这里，我们看到三个关键的治理动力在起作用--一个是对潜在威胁敏感的财务一致的社区，一个是评估威胁真实性质的模型，以及一个到位的治理过程，以做出必要的改变（偏向于安全）。\n\n#### 资产策展\n\n资产策展最自然的地方是 NFT 收集 DAO，如 PleasrDAO。这些 DAO 自然地充当艺术和文化策展人，DAO 治理代币被用来投票决定增加或删除资产。然而，DeFi DAO 也经常面临这个问题。虽然有些机制，如 Uniswap，允许无权限的资产添加--任何人都可以用新的资产创建一个交易池--但其他有杠杆的机制却无法做到这一点。特别是，像 Aave 和 Compound 这样的借贷协议利用治理来决定哪些资产可以被添加或删除。这是因为必须为每种资产选择一些参数，包括保证金要求、利率曲线、保险费用--而这些决定对协议安全至关重要。\n\n让我们提供一个简单的例子来说明可能出错的情况。假设我们铸造了一种新的资产--TarunCoin--其中我是 TarunCoin 供应量 100% 的所有者。现在，假设我创建了一个贷款池，允许我以 TarunCoin 的 100% 的价值进行借款。如果我控制了 TarunCoin 与美元的价格（例如，通过我是唯一流动性提供者的 Uniswap 池），那么我可以使 TarunCoin 的市值非常高（例如 1 亿美元），然后用 TarunCoin 借入 1 亿美元。然而，当我的贷款不可避免地发生违约时，因为几乎没有 TarunCoin 的流动性，那么把资产集中起来借给我 1 亿美元的贷款人就会承担损失。\n\n这个例子说明，资产质量--以代币分布、流动性 / 价格操纵的难易程度和历史交易量来衡量--对于利用杠杆的 DeFi DAO 至关重要。由于许多这样的 DAO 将他们的治理代币作为隐性或显性的保险基金，以便在发生不利事件时偿还贷款人，因此对于这样的 DAO 来说，小心他们所接纳的资产以及如何选择这些资产的参数是至关重要的。随着这个领域的发展，保险产品很可能有助于改善和减少 DeFi 中资产策划所需的治理干预量。\n\n### 运行 DAO 的方法\n\n一个自然的后续问题是：「我们的社区如何才能真正完成这三项任务？我们的社区只关心 X。」随着 DAO 的成熟，一个不断增长的公司和协议的生态系统开始出现，旨在通过自动分析和监测以及帮助谨慎选择资产和参数来减轻 DAO 成员的负担。而且有一些策略可以减少 DAO 内部的复杂性，更有效地分配资源。以下是 DAO 可以采取的一些步骤：\n\n#### 使用治理工具\n\n首先，量化工具的出现，允许你的社区将 DAO （以及潜在的相关协议）中的风险可视化为市场条件的函数，并让 DAO 成员了解对减少抵押品 / 保证金要求或增加利率等进行投票意味着什么。这为 DAO 资金库持有的风险水平提供了更大的透明度，并允许社区更新资金库组成以满足特定的 KPI。\n\n例如，借贷协议 Aave 和 Compound 持有的数十亿美元的资产，有效地充当了基础借贷协议的保险支持。例如，如果有一个大的价格干扰，导致大量贷款违约，给协议中的贷款人造成损失，这些 DAO 可以用他们的资金库来弥补贷款人的损失（例如，见 Compound DAI 清算事件）。\n\n调整协议中的参数，如抵押品要求，有助于减少 DAO 不得不将其资金库用于此类支持事件的可能性。下面是一个用于监测不同 Aave 市场风险的实时仪表板的例子。(披露：我是提供这些服务的 Gauntlet 的创始人和 CEO）。 用于量化风险的工具包括模拟工具，这些工具结合了算法交易和人工智能（如 AlphaGo）中使用的工具。\n\n![为何治理和激励对 DAO 构建及运行很重要？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/8f2cec21d232541e8aa173f8d0895428_ZnogZy7.png-article)\n\n![为何治理和激励对 DAO 构建及运行很重要？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/f11ed524ea405fd0a24bdaa2d17a83c5_UdH9pJA.png-article)\n\n这类工具和服务的目标是让社区能够扩展到更大和更多样化的人群。由于智能合约的可组合性，协议变得越来越复杂和交织在一起，治理对每个新成员来说都变得越来越困难。这反过来又使新成员更难加入 DAO 并以有意义的方式参与。\n\n通过帮助用户简单地解释隐藏在 DAO 中的复杂行为，可视化可以帮助新成员入职。例如，工具可以让所有成员了解他们正在投票的内容，而不需要了解底层技术的复杂性。然后，每个 DAO 工具或服务可以专门从技术、财务和社区的角度提供可解释的、易于理解的 DAO 健康状况的仪表盘。\n\n在 DeFi 内部，DAO 倾向于处理的主要问题涉及金融和技术风险，因此他们的代币持有者使用工具来评估这些风险。他们还可以帮助代理投票人（例如，将投票权委托给另一个投票人的投票人）评估他们的代理在改善协议性能方面的表现如何。\n\n#### 将 DAO 划分成「子组」\n\n另一个可以帮助扩大 DAO 成员和范围的潜在策略是将 DAO 划分为子组，每个子组独立运作并专注于特定任务（开发、营销等）。最早成功进行分区的 DAO 之一是 Yearn Finance。Yearn 的快速增长和不断的产品演变导致需要将团队分成多个小组，独立处理前端用户体验、核心协议开发和营销等任务。Yearn 早期的贡献者 tracheopteryx、zemm 和 zakku 创建了 Coidinape，一个 DAO 形式的 Asana，以帮助贡献者协调。这个产品允许 DAO 跨团队、跨时区和跨匿名身份管理任务和工资。\n\n![为何治理和激励对 DAO 构建及运行很重要？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/1cd7b376ba6159fc93abf49c1d242605_bujoWYk.png-article)\n\n至于一个更去中心化的方法，人们可以使用 DAO 智能合约来明确地将 DAO 分割成团队。人们可以通过允许某些子组（称为子 DAO 或 pods），在 DAO 的智能合约中调用某些功能来做到这一点。Orca 协议已经围绕自动化这一程序建立了工具，以便那些没有开发经验的人可以轻松地创建 pod。该协议允许你创建可以管理 DAO 内某些功能的授权组，允许你的社区的不同子组独立操作这些任务。\n\n![为何治理和激励对 DAO 构建及运行很重要？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/52ced04044ca5cb5a32ac435c2632faf_g1bt1oh.png-article)\n\n#### 雇用员工\n\n关于 DAO 治理的最后说明。一旦 DAO 拥有足够大的社区和资产，就必须雇用能够将精力全职用于维护、沟通和管理任务的人。然而，DAO 必须注意不要创造任何「活跃参与者」，代币持有人可能会依赖这些参与者来推动相关代币的价值。因此，增加服务供应商必须考虑到去中心化的问题。\n\n在雇用全职开发人员、社区经理和其他工作人员方面失败的 DAO，在他们的资产枯竭或需要服务时，经常发现自己处于十字路口。曾经炙手可热的 DeFi 协议随着他们的 DAO 金库的耗尽而失去动力，没有一个 DAO 成员认为他们有足够的机制来确保持续运营（例如通过协议改进或资产重新分配）。\n\n虽然 PleasrDAO 有一个理事会（很像公司的董事会），帮助指导 DAO 的长期方向，但关键贡献者不能确保 DAO 执行的启动、融资和策展工作完美无缺。对此，DAO 往往也可以借鉴正规组织的最佳做法。\n\n形成拥有资产的去中心化互联网机构的协调努力，有时被视为未知领域的「狂野西部」。但在传统系统中发现的许多问题和解决方案--人类也在其中进行协调--可以为 DAO 提供信息和指导；它们已经经历了几个世纪的压力测试，可以为这个新世界进行调整。在许多方面，从过去和 DAO 近期历史中学习，可能有助于新的建设者为在线机构的未来找到并调整想法。\n\n*感谢 John

{"id": "KRH5PeoF3jWI8cGyjqiIFeSfOWNhEpM2FfUYCTqzous", "title": "Vote on Race Mechanics for Space Race #1 (November 9-12th)", "body": "Last week, we [published](https://superrare.mirror.xyz/CXrDKSCivTO_QzdgruW-CYJWDI90rRnONUhh8WK_nFQ) an update that governance for the SuperRare DAO is now beginning to reach the \"rubber-meets-road\" stage, along with the [minutes](https://www.notion.so/2021-10-28-SuperRare-DAO-Council-Meeting-Minutes-a914981d474d4a69ba746d3ad1db1d59) from the latest Governance Council meeting.\n\nAs detailed in those posts, after receiving 35 amazing submissions (!) we are now preparing to execute the first Space Race later this month. We were blown away by the extensive interest in becoming a Space Operator and the desire to participate in curation of the SuperRare Network.\n\nA first draft of the potential Space Race governance mechanics was [published](https://docs.superrare.com/) in August alongside the SuperRare 2.0 announcement - which also included the launch of the SuperRare DAO and $RARE governance token.\n\nSince then, things have evolved quite a bit: the first round of Space applications has been received and reviewed, the design and product dev cycle has reached full steam, and we've had hundreds of conversations with artists, collectors, curators, and community members about both Spaces themselves and how we can begin the work of decentralizing curation on SuperRare.\n\nGiven the additional time, information & user feedback collected since - the Council has been working with input from SuperRare Labs to draft a set of updated rules and procedures for SR#1. In the spirit of transparency and community agency, the Council - hoping to establish a set of improvements and updates that build upon the originally proposed model - is setting forth these mechanics for the community to review & ratify in advance of the first Space Race.\n\nWhile the goals and intent of the Space Race remain the same, we believe the following adjustments should create a better experience for both Space applicants and $RARE holders while we collectively learn how this product ought to be designed in order to achieve its full vision and potential. As a result, we are asking the community to certify the following voting framework for Space Race #1:\n\n* All 35 entrants will be included in the Space Race #1 racing slate, rather than a curated short-list, in recognition of the hard work from all participants to join in this inaugural race\n* There will be 5 winning spaces selected for admission in the first Space Race, rather than just a single winner\n* In the interest of ensuring scarcity while preserving flexibility, the Council is proposing an upper bound on the number of Spaces that can be added to the network in any month to a maximum of 10\n* Voting in the Space Race itself will remain open for 2 weeks, rather than 48hrs, to allow for better participation and engagement amongst the entire DAO\n* The race itself will be held using the Mirror [Token Race](https://dev.mirror.xyz/dLLIq4Iebg5DLWJbOWa3sU6oQuwbogkmqPnz-ZbzPUg) platform, rather than Snapshot, to better accommodate the desire for multiple winners, a longer racing window, more direct control over curation by $RARE token holders, and better support for social features\n\n**Read the full draft proposal → [here](https://www.notion.so/Establishing-Space-Race-Curation-Parameters-Governance-Methods-and-Procedures-e054fcc927fb4942a2f370a1f9d15415) ←**\n\nThese proposed changes were reached after thorough Council deliberation, and were decided to be in the best interests of the Network given the learnings gleaned over the last 3 months. While there is a balance to be struck between exhaustive deliberation and speedy action necessary to seize strategic opportunity - in the ethos of progressive decentralization, we believe the best ideas can emerge from anywhere and we must begin developing the muscles to allow for an optimal balance between analysis paralysis and swift action. Therefore, we've opened a [new section of the forum](https://forum.superrare.com/c/governace-voting/12) dedicated to discussion about SR#1 and Space Race governance generally, and welcome your feedback as we continue to iteratively design the Spaces product together as a community.\n\nStarting ***next Tuesday Nov 9th, and running for a 96 hour voting period though Nov 12th, we invite all members of the SuperRare DAO to vote in the forthcoming [Snapshot poll](https://www.notion.so/How-to-vote-on-Snapshot-e4a0c7caa0fe408cbe41191029572c35) to approve the described enhancements*** that we feel will make the Space Race a higher quality experience for all participants and stakeholders.\n\nWe look forward with great anticipation to this groundbreaking milestone that will admit the first community curated Spaces to SuperRare Network - beginning our journey toward decentralized curation for the world's leading CryptoArt marketplace and placing increasing control into the hands of our membership...onward!", "timestamp": 1636166793, "digest": "rmDYSeYkCNUvap-ZUJVL1Z0cIeLRL9q0eIjDZkhxUGw", "contributor": "0x79150011a8DC56857459F652d165fB772EE6EB1C"}

The internet is not bad for creative people. Web2 is bad for creative people.”**— Chris Dixon\n\n**“Denying and pushing back against NFTs and crypto is basically saying, “We’re not going to have a collectively owned future. We’re going to have a corporate-owned future, and we’re going to have a government-owned future.'”**— Naval Ravikant\n\n**“As with all sorts of tech things and money involved, there are bad people. It’s just inevitable. It happened in the ’90s; it happened in the 2000s. It happens now. And those people give Web3 a very bad name. We want to get rid of those people.”**— Chris Dixon\n\n**“Where we started was we actually decentralized the hardest thing. The hardest thing to decentralize is money. And once you have money decentralized, then you can own private property.”**— Naval Ravikant\n\n**“The killer app of the internet is networks. We’ve got a million networks built on this thing now.”**— Chris Dixon\n\n**“Any regulator that stops the next generation of artists and musicians and gamers and game developers from owning their platforms and their work is going to go into the wastebasket of history as a villain.

{"id": "v-CUt-gKy7klk9FI4EbZYBMcTi-Gj_P6K5W3aVbbDW0", "title": "SandLabs | Project Launch", "body": "## Our Team\n\nThe ***SandLabs*** Team currently consists of [Wyatt Walsh](https://wwalsh.io/) and [Ryan Epprecht](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-epprecht-177a6a105/). Having met in high school, this dynamic duo has a rich history together and each member brings a rich set of experiences and skills to the team. Navigate to their various profiles if you are interested in learning more about Wyatt or Ryan.\n\n## Our Vision\n\n***SandLabs*** aims to explore the blockchain domain via a data scientific lens to generate new insights and make helpful contributions to the `BlockchainxData` communities and beyond. The initial focus of our work will be data collection, extraction, and processing high-quality data for future use. At first, this data will primarily come from social media and other API data sources and will focus on `BlockchainxData`-related topics, but could possibly expand once we attain high pipeline functionality and automation capabilities. Upon significant successful data extraction, we plan to conduct analysis across our collected datasets in the hopes of generating helpful `BlockchainxData` industry insights.\n\nData science can be a powerful tool to uncover hidden patterns and predict the future for necessary values. Automation of data scientific processes has become significantly more refined recently, and we hope that we can fully automate the data engineering aspects of our operation; this will enable both a greater breadth of data collection as well as leave more time available for data analysis.\n\nIn addition to sharing our insights with broader communities of `BlockchainxData` developers and practitioners, we hope that the insights we uncover will prove to be helpful leads towards the development of software that will not only help bring about blockchain technology's widespread adoption, but also realize its social benefit. Towards this end, we aim to prioritize ease of use, maximized privacy, and ultimate helpfulness in the design of our projects.\n\n## Progress + A Few Ideas So Far\n\nIn order to help accomplish the vision laid out above, we started with creating ***[SandLabs.co](https://www.sandlabs.co/posts/sandlabs.co)***, a website to help share our project and its creations with the world at large. In order to serve as a strong foundation for hosting future ***SandLabs*** projects, the site was implemented using the popular `Next.js` framework. This is tailored to ***SandLabs'*** current needs, but can be expanded to support our growing interests. The architecture employed should enable us to easily include dynamic content in the future, such as data dashboards, helpful visualizations and animations, and more.\n\nWe hope to utilize a fully serverless cloud architecture that can scale as needed depending on our project’s reception. Considered architectures would also be powerful enough to conduct complex artificial intelligence/machine learning application processes in addition to powering our user-facing applications. This architecture would house our extract, transform, load (ETL) data pipelines, as well as our analysis infrastructure and possibly server-side content rendering.\n\nSo far we have come up with a few possible directions for ***SandLabs*** to explore in the near future. We hope to maximize the impact of our data artifacts by listing them across data exchanges as well as conducting thorough preprocessing on the raw data we collect. To best compile these data artifacts, robust ETL pipelines will be utilized with full automation as a long-term design priority. These ETL pipelines will utilize a variety of different objects within their architecture such as databases (SQL and NoSQL), cloud functions, virtual machines, publication/subscription services, and more.\n\nApart from sharing our collected data itself, we also plan to conduct thorough data scientific analyses — hopefully serving as the bedrock for data storytelling and helpful insight generation. Ideally, these data stories and insights will serve to help better inform the `BlockchainxData` communities and beyond.\n\nWe hope that our insight generation proves fruitful enough to also allow us to glean insights into possible software projects to move towards. Creating software entities such as decentralized applications or helpful developer packages — or even simply a few smart contracts — would be an awesome direction to see ***SandLabs*** expand its work.\n\nTo accomplish our vision we have started by launching SandLabs.co and applying for a grant from Ocean Protocol. If accepted, we hope to immediately start gathering data from various APIs and compiling a robust dataset that will be sold on Ocean.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe hope big things are in store for the future of ***SandLabs***. We intend to dig up a few pearls amongst the data seas.\n\n> *Make sure to stay on the lookout for the upcoming release of a few of our collected data assets as well as a couple blog posts explaining a bit about our projects*\n\n![Let's hit the BlockchainxData beaches 🏝](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KHRZaOikIzkL2MyqC5MT-.png?height=1500&width=1500)\n\n", "timestamp": 1636168947, "digest": "z0jZDCSCLv14axYpbdhMSb-FTTTeEN7QCqzxVkqh8v8", "contributor": "0x367957dF62F5bbbe24AC8D923968B4A560BA0C30"}

{"id": "DmMglBOetmzdYLyYViyHXeBuSTbMnsGi95PmdaTQqkw", "title": "Vote on Race Mechanics for Space Race #1 (November 9-12th)", "body": "Last week, we [published](https://superrare.mirror.xyz/CXrDKSCivTO_QzdgruW-CYJWDI90rRnONUhh8WK_nFQ) an update that governance for the SuperRare DAO is now beginning to reach the \"rubber-meets-road\" stage, along with the [minutes](https://www.notion.so/2021-10-28-SuperRare-DAO-Council-Meeting-Minutes-a914981d474d4a69ba746d3ad1db1d59) from the latest Governance Council meeting.\n\nAs detailed in those posts, after receiving 35 amazing submissions (!) we are now preparing to execute the first Space Race later this month. We were blown away by the extensive interest in becoming a Space Operator and the desire to participate in curation of the SuperRare Network.\n\nA first draft of the potential Space Race governance mechanics was [published](https://docs.superrare.com/) in August alongside the SuperRare 2.0 announcement - which also included the launch of the SuperRare DAO and $RARE governance token.\n\nSince then, things have evolved quite a bit: the first round of Space applications has been received and reviewed, the design and product dev cycle has reached full steam, and we've had hundreds of conversations with artists, collectors, curators, and community members about both Spaces themselves and how we can begin the work of decentralizing curation on SuperRare.\n\nGiven the additional time, information & user feedback collected since - the Council has been working with input from SuperRare Labs to draft a set of updated rules and procedures for SR#1. In the spirit of transparency and community agency, the Council - hoping to establish a set of improvements and updates that build upon the originally proposed model - is setting forth these mechanics for the community to review & ratify in advance of the first Space Race.\n\nWhile the goals and intent of the Space Race remain the same, we believe the following adjustments should create a better experience for both Space applicants and $RARE holders while we collectively learn how this product ought to be designed in order to achieve its full vision and potential. As a result, we are asking the community to certify the following voting framework for Space Race #1:\n\n* All 35 entrants will be included in the Space Race #1 racing slate, rather than a curated short-list, in recognition of the hard work from all participants to join in this inaugural race\n* There will be 5 winning spaces selected for admission in the first Space Race, rather than just a single winner\n* In the interest of ensuring scarcity while preserving flexibility, the Council is proposing an upper bound on the number of Spaces that can be added to the network in any month to a maximum of 10\n* Voting in the Space Race itself will remain open for 2 weeks, rather than 48hrs, to allow for better participation and engagement amongst the entire DAO\n* The race itself will be held using the Mirror [Token Race](https://dev.mirror.xyz/dLLIq4Iebg5DLWJbOWa3sU6oQuwbogkmqPnz-ZbzPUg) platform, rather than Snapshot, to better accommodate the desire for multiple winners, a longer racing window, more direct control over curation by $RARE token holders, and better support for social features\n\n**Read the full draft proposal → [here](https://forum.superrare.com/t/establishing-space-race-curation-parameters-governance-methods-and-procedures/286) ←**\n\nThese proposed changes were reached after thorough Council deliberation, and were decided to be in the best interests of the Network given the learnings gleaned over the last 3 months. While there is a balance to be struck between exhaustive deliberation and speedy action necessary to seize strategic opportunity - in the ethos of progressive decentralization, we believe the best ideas can emerge from anywhere and we must begin developing the muscles to allow for an optimal balance between analysis paralysis and swift action. Therefore, we've opened a [new section of the forum](https://forum.superrare.com/c/governace-voting/12) dedicated to discussion about SR#1 and Space Race governance generally, and welcome your feedback as we continue to iteratively design the Spaces product together as a community.\n\nStarting ***next Tuesday Nov 9th, and running for a 96 hour voting period though Nov 12th, we invite all members of the SuperRare DAO to vote in the forthcoming [Snapshot poll](https://www.notion.so/How-to-vote-on-Snapshot-e4a0c7caa0fe408cbe41191029572c35) to approve the described enhancements*** that we feel will make the Space Race a higher quality experience for all participants and stakeholders.\n\nWe look forward with great anticipation to this groundbreaking milestone that will admit the first community curated Spaces to SuperRare Network - beginning our journey toward decentralized curation for the world's leading CryptoArt marketplace and placing increasing control into the hands of our membership...onward!", "timestamp": 1636170197, "digest": "rmDYSeYkCNUvap-ZUJVL1Z0cIeLRL9q0eIjDZkhxUGw", "contributor": "0x79150011a8DC56857459F652d165fB772EE6EB1C"}

北京报道\n\n![经济观察报2005.12.5](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/klIE8FQUisVRzxv5AzPvT.jpg?height=4608&width=3456)\n\n李泽厚是谁？\n\n据说有一年李泽厚南下，去某大学附近的书店作客。老板在门口贴了一张不起眼的告示，引得诸多学子停步注目。他们兴高采烈，奔走相告：李泽楷要来了！\n\n一位学者在听到这个段子后感叹，“一瞬间，我感到了世事的苍凉。想当年，李泽厚是何等了得啊！八十年代的大学生、研究生，有几个不知道李泽厚的？就连他那本其实没多少人读得懂的《批判哲学的批判》，也是许多青年学子的架上之书、枕边之物。”\n\n李泽厚曾说，1990年代是“思想家淡出，学问家突显”。在新世纪已经五年的今天，大概是学人淡出、商人突显了。将李泽厚错认作李嘉诚之子、小超人李泽楷，这是时代的悲哀还是进步呢？\n\n想当年，李泽厚初出茅庐就一鸣惊人，在1956年的美学争论中，26岁的他发表《论美感、美和艺术》一文，提出美是“客观性和社会性的统一”，批评了当时鼎鼎大名的美学家朱光潜和蔡仪的观点。\n\n在此后的反右和文革中，政治的惊涛骇浪波及中国绝大部分思考着的头脑，而李泽厚却几乎没受影响。在太行山下放、在“五七干校”劳动，当有的同事忙着做家具的时候，李泽厚却用红宝书蒙着康德的著作，搞自己的哲学研究。\n\n1970年代末百废待兴，李泽厚的作品有如横空出世。从哲学、美学到思想史，他横跨多个领域。从思想到语言，都是一种崭新的面貌。\n\n《批判哲学的批判》这一纯哲学著作，当时竟然卖了3万册。而三部(古代、近代、现代)思想史论更是影响深远。李的思想洞见和文字魅力在《美的历程》一书中表现得淋漓尽致。该书1981年出版后，十年之内印了八次，成为最畅销的学术著作，甚至成为一个时代的标志，被冯友兰先生高度评价，是对中国美学、中国文学，以至于中国哲学最精练浓缩的概括。\n\n这本1979年的作品，丝毫没有革命八股的文风。即便今日看来，文字依然珠圆玉润。光是标题，便气度不凡：龙飞凤舞、青铜饕餮、魏晋风度、盛唐之音……\n\n有人宣称，以七七、七八级本科生和七八、七九级研究生为代表的一拨人是“读朦胧诗和李泽厚长大的一代”。\n\n高尔基曾这样评价叶赛宁：“与其说是一个人，倒不如说是自然界特意为了诗歌，为了表达无尽的‘田野的悲哀’、对一切生物的爱和恻隐之心而创造出来的一个器官。”《原道》主编陈明套用这个说法，认为李泽厚“也是上帝赐给中国的，进行思想的器官，为了感受时代的气息、脉搏，把它彰显放大”。\n\n李泽厚似乎总是能把握住思想文化的历史脉搏，引领学术界的目光投向一个又一个新领域。1980年代后的“美学热”、“文化热”，都与李泽厚有关。可以说，他在这十年间中国思想文化的进程中留下了自己明显的烙印。\n\n李泽厚告诉记者，他的所有书都有盗版，即便如此，著作收入也超过100万了。也许李的思想仍然有人质疑，但其在思想启蒙方面的覆盖力，恐怕不亚于正统的教科书。\n\n在1980年代，李泽厚是时髦。但世移时易，有人认为李泽厚过时了：1989年写《华夏美学》的他已是“日薄西山”。而1996年的《世纪新梦》更是“老态毕现”。\n\n李泽厚的思想究竟会在历史上占据什么位置，恐怕今人无权置喙。口无遮拦的他对记者说，“有人说我已在美学上远超朱光潜，哲学上远超冯友兰。我心里倾向接受，口头却连说不敢，我还没想清这到底是我的谦虚还是虚伪。”“对我的评价，可能要在我死后30年或50年。”\n\n李泽厚1992年1月去了美国。每年回国一次。在异国他乡教书8年，现已退休。1980年代如众星捧月般的他，1990年代给金发碧眼的年轻人讲授中国的孔子和康梁，不知是怎样的一番滋味。\n\n当学问家取代思想家，当新左派和自由主义者闹得不可开交之时，一个远离中国、远离学术圈的老人，偶尔也会超然世外地说些真话。2002年，李泽厚和陈明的对话录《浮生论学》出版，因为臧否了不少今人，惹来非议。\n\n11月的深秋，李泽厚身着睡衣，在家里接受了本报记者的专访。当他谈起世界和历史，一种孤高而强大的自信折射出背后庞大的思想支撑。当他用湘音聊起老长沙的旧时风貌，一种温暖的气氛烘托出这位老人的恬淡心境。\n\n李泽厚曾说“走自己的路”。在他看来，自己的人生际遇与反右、文革一样，都是社会大潮的起伏而已，而只有自己的思索一直闲庭信步，节奏未曾改变。正如记者几次要求，他依然穿着睡衣拍照。\n\n下面的对话，大部分都是常识。恐怕只有清醒而“不懂人情世故”的老人，才能说出这些明白而不拐弯的实话。\n\n## 访谈\n\n记者：我们的报纸提倡理性、建设性，据说您很早就有类似的提法，能不能讲一讲？\n\n李泽厚：我在1980年代有过类似说法。对五四运动，我曾评价为，理性不足，激情有余。这八个字是我曾在纪念五四运动时写的。\n\n现在有股潮流，有批人物，否定五四，觉得五四斩断了中国的文化传统。这个观点我是非常反对的。但我认为五四有很多缺点。\n\n学术界流行尼采和后现代。现在把尼采捧为学术偶像，我是不赞成的。我认为，破坏一个东西不大难，但建设一个东西却不那么容易。而人类社会是靠建设而不是靠破坏来维持其存在的。毛泽东说，先破后立，不破不立，主要是强调破的方面。实际上立比破要难得多，破了不见得立得起来。\n\n比如写学术文章，以前我说过，你指出哪个人的文章有一二三四五错误，那不太难，但你要想就这个问题提出自己的一点真正的建设性意见，就不容易。小到写文章，大到一个国家和社会的成长，建设是重要的，所以我很赞成你们报社的这个提法。\n\n一个很有名的知识分子跟我讲，知识分子的任务就是批判。似乎一考虑建设，就是想做帝王师。这个看法是不对的。这个立场在欧美可以，因为这些社会的资本主义已经很稳固了，你怎么批判也没什么关系。欧美一些知识分子做的事情就是批判，他们不管建设不建设。譬如福柯，就是反对理性，认为理性是囚笼、启蒙是错误。但是，对中国，特别是目前的中国来说，更需要理性的、建设性的东西。这一点我1999年也讲过了。\n\n20世纪70年代末80年代初，我在一篇文章中说，马克思主义不仅是批判的哲学，也应该是建设的哲学。过去一讲到马克思主义，修饰语就是批判的、革命的。但我认为，马克思主义应该也是建设性的。怎么样建设一个好的社会，精神方面、物质方面都有许多问题值得探讨研究。\n\n所以，我很赞成理性、建设性。这不是奉承你们的报纸。当然批判也应该是理性的，但现在流行的是非理性、反理性。\n\n记者：记得您说过，在不同社会阶段，需要的思想是不一样的。欧美的社会制度发展已经比较成熟，所以需要福柯这类批判思想。但在中国现在这个阶段，后现代这些东西是不是远远超前于现实了？\n\n李泽厚：这是一个复杂的问题。一个思想的作用要放到具体的社会环境里去考查。\n\n西方的资本主义发展了几百年，理性的东西相当周密。美国的法律多如牛毛，法律就是理性的具体表现。而理性，特别是工具理性，在中国是太少了。而在西方，却是工具理性太多，把人都捆起来了。所以，他们需要破坏和解构。中国恰恰相反。学者们要模仿、要接轨，把后现代硬搬过来，在基本学理上是有问题的。当然，后现代作为一种现象，为什么和如何可能产生，这倒值得研究。\n\n我想可能有这个原因：主流学者不是讲“历史的终结”嘛，历史终结，便不需要革命了，激情也没有了，过一种平平淡淡的生活。有些人感觉极不满意，有各种虚无和自我暴弃。\n\n但是，就中国社会而言，大部分人仍然没有过上好的生活，大量农民工还在为生存拼死拼活。所以，这些思想就和时代脱节了。其实，就算在资本主义国家，也有贫富悬殊问题。不然法国哪有那么大的骚乱，也是因为那些移民的第二代受到歧视吧。\n\n讲后现代的人，很大部分是学院里的教授。一些人大肆赞美非洲的原始部族。有学者说，那你干吗不把自己的孩子送到非洲去？为什么自己不去那里生活？\n\n后现代思潮实际上是在学院里，并不是发达社会的思想主流，社会的主流还是非常理性的。\n\n现在西方最时髦的就是后现代，要赶时髦，才能接轨嘛。学术和科技不一样，科技当然最时髦的就是最好的。学术却不一定。现在的理论不一定比柏拉图好到哪里去。后现代的这些代表人物反对理性、反对启蒙。但他们其实并不比康德、洛克、休谟强到哪里去。福柯、德里达这些人，我觉得比马克思差远了。\n\n记者：您仔细看过福柯、德里达吗？\n\n李泽厚：当然，只看过一些，但他们的基本思想我知道。比如福柯，我认为比较精彩的是，他说知识是与权力联系在一起的，任何一种知识都是被权力支配着。这是有道理的，甚至某些自然科学，都是被某种权力支配的。没有什么真正超脱的知识，没有与政治无关的真理。但是，马克思的思想里早就包含着这一点。其实，福柯他们受马克思的影响很深，但他们不愿意讲。海德格尔也是这样。\n\n福柯的其他主张，比如理性是监狱等等，我以为，学术价值并不高。\n\n记者：您的思想的两个基点，是不是马克思主义和儒家经典？\n\n李泽厚：一个是马克思，不是马克思主义。因为马克思也说他自己不是马克思主义者。哈哈。另一个是中国传统。我是在中国传统的基础上融化康德和马克思。我也吸收了不少后现代的思想。例如，后现代思潮反对绝对的、先验的理性，反对像康德、黑格尔那样的理性。我提出的实用理性，恰恰也是反对绝对先验的理性。我认为理性是从经验中提升出来的。这些方面便和后现代有吻合之处，或者说吸纳了他们的一些东西。又如，我反对他们的相对主义和反二分法，却又强调“度”的灵活性和不确定性，等等。\n\n记者：从计划经济到市场经济，中国的物质生活是朝向欧美那个方向。在精神文化层面上，中国是不是缺什么，怎么解决？比如中国人是不是需要宗教？\n\n李泽厚：这个问题太大了，不好谈。刘小枫说，五四时代的一个最大错误，就是没有把基督教搬进来。所以他希望基督教来救中国。但我的看法是，在基层，特别在农村和下层社会，基督教可能会有很大的传播。但要中国知识分子普遍接受基督教，是比较困难的。\n\n我也说过，在美国上课时，有个学生问我，你们中国人不信上帝，怎么还能维持那么久呢？他很惊讶。这是一个很好的问题。汉族发展到今天这么庞大的规模和人口，是一个奇迹。\n\n原因之一，我在最近的一个文章中讲，是因为中国有个“礼教”，儒家的教。它不信上帝，也不拜孔子。但是，它拜五个字：天地国亲师。我记得小时候，家里的堂屋供奉着祖宗牌位，后面的红纸上写了五个大字，天地国亲师。这就是中国的宗教，拜的就是这个东西。原来是天地君亲师，辛亥革命以后就改成天地国亲师了。国是国家，亲就是长辈和亲戚。中国的礼教，是一套行为规则，一种伦理规范，一种情感信仰。所以，我讲中国礼教的特点是宗教、伦理、政治三合一。\n\n三纲五伦，这就是中国的宗教，是和伦理、政治相结合的一个东西。但是，这个传统也丢掉了。\n\n过去的这个传统是有经济基础的，祠堂、宗祠有田，由族长来支配钱怎么用，或者办学，或者在饥荒时义赈，救济灾民。现在这些都没有了。\n\n在新的形势下，我们怎么来应对？假设我们从外面借一个宗教比如基督教或伊斯兰过来，可能性不大吧？！能否和怎样创造一种新的形式，回到中国人过去那种天地国亲师的信仰(而非政治或伦理)状态？这是中国文化要解决的大问题。\n\n到现在为止，中国还是人情味比较浓的一个社会。注重家庭生活，尊敬师长、长辈，注意各种亲属关系，和别的民族还是不同。比如打工妹赚了钱，还要寄回家，很顾家的。这在西方是不可能的。这说明什么？说明还是存在某种传统。不能说基础牢固，但场域尚在，还有可为。在这个基础上怎么发展出信仰？学者要思索，也要做一些社会调查，还要政治家的努力。这是很艰巨的事情。\n\n记者：这和您说的“西体中用”有关系吗？\n\n李泽厚：大有关系。关于西体中用，我已经写了很长的文章，不再重复。简单说两点。所谓西体就是现代化，这个现代化是从西方引进的，不是讲改革开放嘛；“体”是指社会存在。西体是指社会存在和日常生活的现代化。这才是真正的人类本体。这和我说的吃饭哲学是联系在一起的。这个“体”，不是虚无飘渺的中国精神、文化传统、精气神啊什么的。\n\n第二，我的这个西体中用是针对中体西用而言的。中体西用来自张之洞，其主要目的就是维护封建专制主义。没有中体西用，我也不会说西体中用。而中用，是西方的一套搬到中国来后的应用。中国用西方的体，会创造出新形式。所以我说转换性创造。从而，这个体也就并不完全等同于西方的那个体了。这个问题讲起来很复杂，详细的可参看我的《再说西体中用》一文。\n\n记者：上海7月份开设了首个中小学生诵经班，辅导他们学习《三字经》、《千字文》、《百家文》等儒家启蒙经典。请问您对儿童读经运动有什么看法？\n\n李泽厚：我并不反对读些经典，不然我写《论语今读》干什么。但要看你用什么思想来指导读经运动，是国粹主义、复古主义、保守主义？这些我是反对的。\n\n记者：您刚才说到中国礼教的特点，是政治、宗教、伦理三合一，这出自您对巫的理解吧？现在年轻人的思维结构，完全是西方现代科学那一套。而西方概念体系和中国传统是搭不上界的。比如哲学、宗教，中国过去都没有这些完整的概念。但您是从根子上思考，建立了一套概念体系。\n\n李泽厚：我就是从根子上找。例如，为什么中国人说天人合一？这在西方是不可能的，因为上帝和人是绝对不同质的。你只能皈依上帝，请上帝赎你的罪。你不能和上帝变成一体(除了某些异端派别)。中国的主流，儒家、道家都讲天人合一。这是哪里来的？就是我说的巫史传统。似乎别人还没这么说过。\n\n记者：周公和孔子发挥了巨大作用。\n\n李泽厚：我认为周公、孔子、秦始皇，是对中国历史影响最大，也最重要的三个人。\n\n记者：秦始皇为什么了不起呢？\n\n李泽厚：我以前没有讲过，我不是研究历史的，发言权不够。\n\n秦始皇统一中国是了不起的事情。而且，他搞了书同文等等。汉字在维持中华民族的延续、发展和统一方面起了极大的作用。我认为，汉字并不是口头语言的复写，和西方语言完全不同。但我不是语言学家，这只是我的一个看法。但我觉得这个看法很重要。\n\n汉字怎么来的？来自结绳记事。所以汉字具有神圣性、可崇拜性。我小时候，经常看到墙上贴着一张纸，上写“敬惜字纸”。一张白纸，写了字，就应该爱惜它，尊敬它。没有汉字，中国很早就分成很多个民族国家了，就和欧洲分成那么多民族一样。\n\n而且，汉字控制着语言的发展，而不是语言控制文字的发展。在西方恰恰相反，是语言控制文字的发展。要英国教授看懂11世纪的英文，那是不可能的事情。但我们可以看懂孔子、孟子的东西。文字有这么强的持续性，语言受它的控制。\n\n除了书同文，秦始皇还有汉武帝把六国开始有的郡县制给统一化、制度化了，建立了文官制度等等。这也很了不起。中国的基础都是秦汉时打下的。\n\n记者：记得您讲过，在地方和中央的关系上，您还是倾向于中央集权？\n\n李泽厚：1990年代我和很多朋友争论时说过，中央集权很重要，不能搞地方分权。中国最可怕的是内战。如果地方分权，每个地方都有个军区支持它，那湖南和广东就可以打仗了。我们这么大一个国家、统一市场，多好。欧盟就是想搞个统一市场啊。\n\n什么事都有利必有弊。中央集权当然有弊端，但比分权可能带来的四分五裂好得多。\n\n这个方面我和很多人看法不一样。有人提倡地方自治，我是不赞成的。可以搞试验，但如果发展趋向与中央对立，那就麻烦了。\n\n记者：哪些方面可以分，哪些可以统？您能不能讲得细致一点？\n\n李泽厚：我是搞哲学的，只能说个大概。经济上、政治上，哪些该分，哪些该统，那是我无法发言的。但我当年就赞成宏观调控，1990年代初吧。辛亥革命最大的问题，就是把中央集权的象征打掉了。后果一定是军阀混战。\n\n记者：您似乎对民族主义比较反感。\n\n李泽厚：民族主义，是很危险的事情。今天在世界任何地方都要反对民族主义。民族主义是最容易煽动民众感情的一种主义。如果有人鼓动，我们和日本打一仗，那一定是许多青年人争先恐后。现在之所以不能搞议会、多党制，原因之一是打民族主义大旗的政党一定优势胜出。这是非常危险的。\n\n现在学术界也有某种民族主义思想，包括我的一些学生、朋友，我是不赞成的。10年前不是有本书《中国可以说不》，我非常反感。现在也有一种情绪，认为21世纪就是中国的世纪。我也不赞成。这是一种莫名其妙的自大。不管哪个方面，科学、军事、技术、政治、文化以及经济，我们比西方都差一大截。所以我最讨厌豪言壮语。这方面我和很多人讲不来。我认为这种姿态容易误导民众。如果号召和日本或美国打仗，那一定热血沸腾，群情激奋，极不理性。\n\n记者：有很多学生游行抵制日货。这个算不算民族主义？\n\n李泽厚：我觉得，政府和学者应该注意这个问题。\n\n但我也一再说欧盟是个榜样，那么复杂的情况可以走到现在这样密切的经济联系，这才是世界真正走向大同的路径。不同文化、不同宗教、不同语言、不同传统可以联合在一起。现在不能想象法德再打仗了。也许30年后俄罗斯也会进去。为什么？因为经济的力量。\n\n对台湾也是，经济力量才能让它不和大陆分开。这就是我的马克思主义，这也是我的吃饭哲学。我说的吃饭，包括衣食住行、性健寿娱，指整个生活质量的不断上升。这个力量是最大的。\n\n人首先是一种物质性的生存动物，我不欣赏那些大讲精神至上的人。我故意用吃饭哲学这个词。有人说庸俗、粗鄙。我就是要它来刺激那些蔑视物质生活的人。你再不庸俗，也要吃饭，而且都想吃点好饭。除了印度的苦行僧。\n\n记者：能不能对自己做个评价？\n\n李泽厚：近两年已经有好几位这么问过我了。我对自己不好作评价，让时人特别是后人评价吧。我总不能像牟宗三说自己的“古今无两”吧，有人说我已在美学上远超朱光潜，哲学上远超冯友兰。我心里倾向接受，口头却连说不敢，我还没想清这到底是我的谦虚还是虚伪。我又想为什么近来老有人问这问题，我想我大概是快死了。\n\n记者：您提了一些概念，如实用理性、乐感文化、一个世界，都很独特。您的这套概念能够在中国和西方的思想之间搭一座桥，是不是可以这样理解？\n\n李泽厚：我抓了一些根本性的问题。这样才能真正走进世界，和西方沟通。从王国维到冯友兰、牟宗三，都是走向世界，我希望将来能走进世界。\n\n我这些概念，不仅中国可以用，将来西方也可以用。比如我的实用理性，当然要很长一段时间以后。对我的评价，可能要在我死后30年或50年。呵呵。\n\n记者：您在和陈明的对话《浮生论学》中几次提到，中国学术界应该重视分析哲学。我也感到，许多人用同一个词，但却是不同的含义，这样讨论问题就容易南辕北辙了。\n\n李泽厚：现在很多人不注意这个问题，经常一篇文章内自己的话有矛盾。其实一直有这个问题，当年讨论形象思维就是如此。现在的文风也不好，学后现代，搞得晦涩难懂，可以清清楚楚讲的，故意曲曲折折、模模糊糊。\n\n记者：对目前国内学术界的主力军，您有什么评价？\n\n李泽厚：在1979年的《古代思想史论》后记中，我说希望属于下一代。我希望能“为王先驱”。\n\n我希望这些年轻人能出一些非常好的作品。我当时说，红卫兵一代搞自然科学是没有希望了。但我希望在人文学界、政治方面出一些有作为的人。包括文艺界，我希望出一些大家。20多年过去了，我对此相当失望。\n\n最大问题是原创性不够，都是转述、模仿。根本性的创造太少。当然也不能胡乱创造。\n\n记者：到现在，您的著作总共印了多少册？\n\n李泽厚：我没有数。我所有书都有盗版。这些书好像还是学生买得多。因此盗版书都集中在学校区域。书有人看就好，可惜错字太多。我的书在台湾卖得也不错，例如《美的历程》，这个没想到。这大概是我的惟一安慰。\n\n记者：为什么一直有人看呢？说明一直没过时。\n\n李泽厚：不随风倒。现在讲华伦斯坦、白银经济等等，我就不信。我以为，不论做事或做学问，重要的是要有自己的判断。我一向说，判断能力比知识重要。到底哪个对，哪个错，对几分，错几分，自己要有判断。现在很多是人云亦云，赶时髦，追风。",

What do you think about global instability? How do you feel about Trump, insurrection, Biden, authoritarian moves, crypto, Wall Street, and social unrest? Is this an aberration, or is this the new normal? \n\nThe truth is that I don't know exactly how this moment plays out. I'll admit that it feels like the slow crescendo of chaos has begun to reach its high point, but then again, history always feels that way when you're in the thick of it. It's only with the benefit of hindsight that we can digest and make sense of what has happened around us. \n\nThis much I do know: Uncertainty, instability, and upheaval are tremendous agents of change. As painful as these moments may be, they offer a narrow window for humanity to take massive leaps forward. \n\nThe challenge of the moment is to make sure that these leaps benefit humanity as a whole, not merely the elites.\n\nNow is the time for ideas like universal basic income, green technology, and ***[decentralized finance](https://blockchain.news/tag/decentralized-finance)*** to take center stage. We have the opportunity to debate the merits of these radical ideas openly and earnestly. If there was ever a time to try out big ideas, this is it. \n\n**This time is different**\n\nWhile periods of historic instability have often led to a reshuffling of the global order, the truth is that it's usually been a reshuffling of the same deck. In the aftermath of WWII, the world saw the decline of the great European powers give way to an ascendent United States and the Soviet Union. Power changed hands, but it remained concentrated in the same political, economic, and social structures that persisted throughout the ages. \n\nI have a feeling that this moment might be different. Decentralization seems to be the theme of the moment, and I believe that we'll see an interesting dynamic emerge from the current portfolio of crises. \n\nRather than power simply shifting hands again from a superpower like the United States to an emerging superpower like China, I believe that we're going to see something completely different. \n\n**A deepening divide**\n\nThe elite and influential individuals who seem to survive and thrive no matter the world's state will leap forward toward an even more decentralized and trans-national existence. We'll see more innovation, more progressive social values, and the emergence of new, non-state power bases. \n\nFor those not as fortunate, however, I believe that the opposite will hold. Rather than moving into a new, more accepting society, those left behind will turn inwards, deepening the rift that exists in nearly all modern cultures. We've already seen this trend play out in the United States and the United Kingdom. \n\n**Embracing the future and plotting the path forward**\n\nIt is time that we stop thinking of ourselves in terms of nations, states, and cultures and begin thinking of ourselves as a single species. After all, in the scope of the Universe, we humans have far more that binds us together than what separates us. \n\nNow is the time for the world's change agents to play an active role in shaping the global society of the twenty-first century. We must work together to emerge from this moment of chaos with a coordinated plan that pushes humanity forward as a whole. We cannot allow the ease of inaction and narrow thinking to seduce us into more of the same. \n\nThis is our \"Anything Is Possible\" moment. Now is the time for radical thinking, creative solutions, and global leadership. \n\nI’m talking about big ideas, like colonizing space, fully migrating to cryptocurrency, and rewriting the rules of how our societies are governed.\n\nWho is with me? ", "timestamp": 1636176027, "digest": "tZRfsRQbaC0ef_n9k_Uc4zBGGCE0mSpBXvWyM2Ww4BE", "contributor": "0x9FE533965a768Cd09a30e6530cf73b32594A0b10"}

The [recent case](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html) of Stephan Thomas who has forgotten the password to his IronKey hard drive that stores his 7,002 Bitcoin is a good example. In general, it has been found that around 20% of existing Bitcoins are lost due to the loss of a password or a seed phrase for resetting the password for the wallet. \n \n\nThe reasons for losing access to cryptocurrency exchange accounts are several, but commonly most of the time: people forget the password or the two-factor authentication (2FA) details if the 2FA is enabled, change the device on which 2FA was stored, or change the phone number to which 2FA was linked.\n\nWe get lots of requests from our clients at CEX.IO for a two-factor authorisation reset. It ultimately comes from a lack of caution and attentiveness: people buy new mobile phones or change the phone number to which their keys are tied, and do not bother to change their 2FA data on the old ones. Then, when they lose access, they often blame the exchanges for being unable to operatively give them a new 2FA.  But recovering access to an exchange account is not as easy as recovering a password. If you had 2FA enabled and you can no longer pass it, you will have to pass an identification procedure with the exchange to confirm your identity and reset the 2FA.\n\nIf a client has previously passed ID verification, they will have to do it again to confirm their identity. This is done to protect the client’s funds – in order to ensure that the request to reset the 2FA does not come from a malicious actor. This procedure takes time as you have to send photos of yourself to the exchange, and they should be identified by the customer support personnel. But many people dislike dealing with such procedures, thinking of them as troublesome and time-consuming. And this, in turn, traps exchanges in an unpleasant position where they have to consider both simplicity and client convenience as well as their obligations to keep the funds entrusted to them safe. \n\nSometimes it also so happens that hackers get hold of passwords and even 2FA on a hacked device. If that occurs, hackers usually change the 2FA details on the victim’s exchange account. In such situations, we temporarily block the withdrawal on the client’s account and notify them via email and SMS to let the account owner take action in case they were not the ones to change the 2FA.\n\nWays to Restore Access \n\nThere are several ways wallet services provide for the safekeeping of cryptocurrency: a seed-phrase, a multi-signature, a deferred money transfer, and trusted wallets. \n\nThe seed-phrase is used in the wallets which are only accessible to their owners and consists of several random words. In case you have forgotten the password to such a wallet, you can enter the seed phrase and access your wallet this way. In case you lose and forget the seed phrase, you will no longer be able to restore access to your funds.\n\nThe multi-signature mechanism of several keys is often utilized in online “hot” wallets on exchanges. Oftentimes, wallets with a multi-sig have three signatures and require two of them to execute a command. Two of these signatures are held with the client and the third – with the service provider. Under normal conditions, the key of the firm and one of the client’s keys are used for all operations. The second key the client has is a backup one that should be kept safely and may be used as a second one if the service provider stops operations.\n\nA deferred-transfer mechanism is also a good way of keeping your digital currency accessible to you even if you forget the password and cannot restore it. It automatically sends the funds in the wallet to another ***[address](https://blockchain.news/tag/address)*** after the expiry of the set time. This way you can regain access to your funds in another wallet when this transfer comes through.\n\nAnd trusted wallets are the ones used on cryptocurrency exchanges. Their advantage is that you can always regain access to them via a KYC procedure. But their flaw is that you can only access such wallets through your account on the exchange and not directly via a key.\n\n \n\nAt CEX.IO, we do our best to educate our clients on what to do not to lose access to their accounts, how they should act in situations when it happens after all, and how to simplify the recovery process. And we can assert with confidence that prudence and discipline are the two principles that will be your best guarantees against the permanent loss of your cryptocurrency funds.\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1636176115, "digest": "OYaiTPd5pcDWGgqpjdp7TAY6bQksMZ6gU_NCjF3agAg", "contributor": "0x923bAfF6C78Af556FFe342C2EB4a80a7bD715A7D"}

But there are some beginner mistakes that you will want to avoid when securing your assets.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\n1. Don’t Use a Brain Wallet\n\nWhen you first created your cryptocurrency wallet, odds are were provided with a 12, 16, or 24-word recovery phrase.\n\nAs its name suggests, this phrase (often termed a mnemonic) is used to recover your wallet and any funds it contains, such as if you lost your wallet or the device it was previously stored on.\n\nDespite its label as a mnemonic, you shouldn’t attempt to simply memorize your wallet, unless you also have a physical backup stored.

Don’t Pay for a Wallet\n\nThe vast majority of cryptocurrency wallets are available free of charge.\n\nHowever, there are also a large number of cryptocurrency wallets that are not free, while many of these offer additional features that might justify this cost, others offer only the standard features you could find for free with one of the myriad free wallets.\n\nAs a beginner, odds are you’re not going to need any advanced wallet features that might incur a cost. Instead, try out one of the numerous free wallets available — you will typically be able to find one that offers the features you need.\n\nIn general, some of the basic features you should be looking for in a free cryptocurrency wallet include support for multiple cryptocurrencies; a wide range of security features; built-in exchange functionality; and ease of use.\n\nSome of the most popular free multi-asset wallets currently include Coin Wallet, Exodus, and Jaxx Liberty.\n\nHere's What to do Instead\n\nAs a cryptocurrency beginner, you may be tempted to simply pay for the very best of everything to keep your funds safe.\n\nThis might mean paying $100+ for a cryptocurrency hardware wallet or storing your assets on one of the myriad custodial wallet platforms and paying potential subscription fees — due to no other reason than the fact they’re often simple to use and easily accessible.\n\nBut this is not necessary.

It's possible to lose money by storing ***[Bitcoin](https://blockchain.news/tag/Bitcoin)***, buying and selling it, and making transactions on and off the exchange. How to get acquainted with this new type of assets, how to avoid losses, and develop your trading skills\n\n**Trading and Investing**\n\nIt is better to start with the world of cryptocurrencies by choosing a strategy. The main ones are investing or trading. The first involves the purchase of an asset and long-term storage. The second is short-term speculation. The trader makes a lot of trades with cryptocurrency, trying to make a profit in a short period of time.\n\nDepending on the chosen strategy, cryptocurrency storage methods differ as well. For investments, cold wallets are better suited. This way you can keep cryptocurrency on your computer or a flash drive. Plus - security, no one can steal cryptocurrency without direct access to it.\n\nMinus - illiquidity. If suddenly, the rate of the coin starts to fall sharply and the user wants to sell it, it will take time to transfer the assets to the exchange. In addition to that, it is possible to specify the wrong address when sending the funds, which will lead to a complete loss without the recovery possibility.\n\n**Cryptocurrency Trading**\n\nCryptocurrency trading is a risky business. The price of cryptocurrencies is volatile and can fluctuate by 10-20% per day, sometimes by 50% or more. For inexperienced users that can give an impression that trading can bring in huge profits on a daily basis. However, reality shows the opposite, as a rule, over 90% of newbies lose most of their capital in a short-term perspective and leave the market.\n\nThat is why it is necessary to refer to theory. Such as reading the scientific literature on trading, listening to lectures on this topic, attending appropriate courses, getting acquainted with technical and fundamental analysis, or follow cryptocurrency blogs, for example, <https://stormgain.com/crypto-trading>. All this will not only help you to see the rise and fall of asset prices on charts, but also try to predict them. \n  \n  \n \n\n*Create a free demo account on a StormGain. \n *\n\nStudying the literature and experience of other traders and investors it is also possible to master different trading strategies. One of them is averaging. It involves dividing your capital into several parts and investing small amounts of money in an asset. This method will help you find the best point to buy an asset.\n\nFor beginners, it's better to start trading cryptocurrency with a demo account. Some exchanges allow users to create an account with a virtual balance. This will allow you to understand the market and the exchange's structure, as well as practice.\n\nThen after that, you can deposit a small amount to the exchange. Losses are inevitable, but it is an obligatory stage of becoming a trader. A beginner must feel what it is like to lose money and hold a losing position. This will help a trader to understand his psychology: whether he is able to tolerate losses and not to make panic, erroneous deals, to control himself and make decisions with a cool head. It is better to gain this skill in advance, without paying a lot of money for such an experience.", "timestamp": 1636176538, "digest": "8TSH1H8y1D1RrSPXxXCbhgQnVsclHVv3LwiuuZvq-Is", "contributor": "0xBFEC045c6D89e02174ee1BbADEAeb8837EE039cA"}

{"id": "2tL3l9TcHfcjJ0rSpdB7xBQaoidgHZkJUMk3PP38ljk", "title": "What Will Be The State of Bitcoin Going Forward?", "body": "*Author: Dmytro Volkov, CTO of the international cryptocurrency exchange [CEX.IO](https://cex.io/)*\n\n \n\nBitcoin has features that can be seen as both strengths and weaknesses, especially in comparison to other ***[cryptocurrencies](https://blockchain.news/tag/cryptocurrencies)*** that are present in the market.\n\nLet’s try taking a closer look at the first crypto – what advantages does it have, what problems is it facing, what could it look like in the future?\n\nFirst of all, it needs to be noted that Bitcoin has no original team behind it. What it has is an open source community, and, in a way, that’s what makes Bitcoin’s further development hard. The size of its community means that a lot of effort is required to reach consensus on implementing big changes in its blockchain network. \n\nThis can looks like a weakness if we compare Bitcoin to other blockchains – like Ethereum, for example. Ethereum has a native team and a community leader, which makes large-scale changes to its network relatively easier to pull off. But on the other hand, it can also be seen as a strength. Because Bitcoin offers high decentralisation in terms of altering the blockchain’s code, it means that for changes to take place, a proper worldwide consensus is required. This, in turn, acts as a guarantee that only the truly desired features will be added, and that the changes will happen in a secure way. This keeps the Bitcoin blockchain reliable and straightforward.\n\n \n\nThen there is the matter of blockchain consensus and the debate of choosing between Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work framework. Many modern blockchain projects choose PoS for the sake of transaction processing speed, but Bitcoin will likely continue to employ PoW. With Proof-of-Work format, high hash power means that the blockchain network has better protection against data loss and attacks – it has proven to be secure in the past. Proof-of-Stake, however, is still relatively new as a concept and potentially not quite as reliable.\n\n \n\nAnd speaking of hash power – this factor rests heavily with the miners’ willingness to invest effort into finding new blocks. Miners’ revenue comes in Bitcoin, and now that its price is on a major rally, it represents a huge motivational factor for miners. And this, in its stead, increases the blockchain’s reliability compared to alternatives. \n\n \n\nTo sum up, we can say that Bitcoin is fundamentally slow – there have been attempts to solve this issue (like SegWit and Lightning Network), but ultimately they could not solve the issue of low network throughput. Because of the complexity of reaching consensus in the network in order to implement changes, it is likely that, in terms of scalability, Bitcoin in the future will remain mostly the way it is now.\n\n \n\nThis means that other blockchains are likely to surpass Bitcoin when it comes to speed and transaction algorithms. But that is fine, because that is not where Bitcoin’s true value lies. In my opinion, it is likely that, rather than the currency of choice for everyday payments, Bitcoin is going to play the role of a long-term method of storing value in the crypto world, going forward.

It has led the way with ***[cryptocurrencies](https://blockchain.news/tag/cryptocurrencies)*** by creating the first regulatory body in the world to establish clear guidelines for ICOs and classifications for tokens, in addition to many other landmark legislative moves to ensure the success of cryptocurrency and DLT companies.\n\n \n\nIn January 2021 Switzerland will introduce a new license type for trading venues focusing on digital assets (DLT Trading Facilities), creating a clearer and lighter regulatory regime. A DLT Trading Facility is a new form of license for security tokens and other forms of digital assets. This legislation also provides a new license for “Uncertified Registered Securities” to stabilize the uncertainty surrounding civil law treatment of security tokens.\n\nThe Swiss regulatory bodies also recognized that to meet the expected needs of fintech start-ups and larger players alike, the DLT Trading Facility License can be applied for in two versions: A smaller, leaner license with lower requirements as well as a more comprehensive license type for higher transaction volumes.\n\n\\[Source: MME Legal | Tax | Compliance\\]\n\n \n\nThe country’s clearly defined tax schemes for blockchain and DLT companies, access to an established ecosystem of service providers with expertise in the blockchain industry, such as law firms, banks, and tax regulation experts, create a supportive business environment. Switzerland’s long tradition in the fintech and the financial sector – and with its thriving “Crypto Valley” – will continue to be the choice of both startups and established global players building new applications for a tokenized economy.\n\n \n\nAs the global headquarters of the newly renamed Diem Association – formerly known as Facebook’s Libra – Switzerland will see the birth of the stablecoin Diem Dollar as soon as regulatory approval is granted by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), it is expected to be approved sometime in January.\n\n \n\nSwitzerland ranked number one of the ten most blockchain-friendly countries in Europe \\[Source: BlockShow Europe 2019\\].\n\n \n\nAn unparalleled brain trust: crypto-friendly research and educational institutions\n\n \n\nOne of the reasons both U.S. and global crypto and DLT companies flock to Switzerland is due to the unparalleled access to an educated and diverse talent pool made possible by the country’s federal institutes of learning and a two-tiered educational system.\n\n \n\nThe first university professorship in blockchain was created at the University of Basel in 2018 and the two federal science and technology institutes in Lausanne and Zurich have been recognized as global leaders in crypto education \\[Source: Coinbase, 2019\\].\n\n \n\nWorld-renowned institutes committed to DLT and blockchain advances assure access to a highly educated and skilled workforce prepared for the explosive growth in cryptocurrency, DeFi, and blockchain in the 2020s.\n\n \n\nThe Blockchain Center at the University of Zurich has become the most active academic cluster in Switzerland. It is led by 22 professors who work to investigate blockchain topics from a multidisciplinary perspective.\n\n \n\nThe remarkable body of research institutions and educational programs devoted to DLT and blockchain technologies are unmatched in the world and make Switzerland an attractive choice for EMEA headquarters and research facilities for crypto companies.\n\n \n\nAn innovation-friendly regulatory network by design\n\n \n\nFINMA’s introduction of unsupervised sandbox regimes in 2017 allowed young fintech startups to grow by not requiring a banking license to accept deposits from the public if certain criteria are met. Rather than stifling innovation, young companies have the freedom to explore and develop before they become regulated.\n\nWith clear metrics and guidelines once they approach “bank-like” status, these promising start-ups then apply and are integrated into the regulatory structure. Since 2019, companies who obtain a fintech license have been able to accept public deposits of up to 100 million Swiss francs, greatly simplifying blockchain and crypto companies’ access to the Swiss market.\n\n \n\nThe innovative sandbox regime introduced only three years ago has had a dramatic effect on the number of fintech and crypto startups that flock to Switzerland. To date, Switzerland boasts:\n\n●  The first regulated crypto banks, SEBA and Sygnum\n\n●  842 blockchain-related companies\n\n●  These companies employ over 4,400 employees\n\n●  This environment has birthed five unicorns: Ethereum, Dfinity, Polkadot, Bitmain, and Diem, with more anticipated. \n\n\\[Source: CV VC Top 50 Report H2/2019\\]\n\n \n\nA legacy of firsts in the cryptocurrency ecosystem\n\n \n\nThe city of Zug was the first state authority in the world to accept Bitcoin as an official means of payment, thus the birth of Switzerland’s “Crypto Valley.” Zug also saw the creation of Ethereum, an open-source platform for decentralized applications resulting in the second most significant cryptocurrency next to Bitcoin.\n\n \n\nThe success of Ethereum helped create a global ecosystem that stretches from German speaking Zurich, Basel, Lucerne and Bern to French speaking Geneva, Neuchatel and Lausanne as well as Ticino, Switzerland's Italian speaking region, each with its own approach and expertise in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\n \n\nIn 2018, Switzerland’s regulatory body, FINMA, became the first regulator in the world to publish clear guidelines on ICOs and classifications for tokens. Later that year, the Geneva cantonal authorities released the very first guide dedicated to supporting ICO project promoters.\n\n \n\nA favorable legislative and tax system for the decade of crypto and blockchain\n\n \n\nIn June 2020, Swiss authorities passed a legislative package impacting around a dozen financial laws which brought favorable changes to the blockchain and DLT sector while at the same time, leaving untouched, the respective tax laws which were already seen as highly favorable to this emerging sector.\n\n \n\nIn 2019, funding of the top 50 Crypto Valley companies totaled US$7.8 billion, and US$3.7 billion for H12020 \\[Source: CVVC Insights\\]. As Swiss companies thrive, U.S. companies such as 21Shares, IBM (whose R&D lab was established in Zurich in 1956), and the aforementioned unicorns Dfinity and Diem, reap the benefits of this crypto sandbox.\n\n \n\nSwitzerland’s newest kid on the block, Diem, plans to develop policies for sanctions compliance and to fight money laundering and terrorist financing, all of huge concern to regulators and Western governments \\[Source: VentureBeat, 2020\\].\n\n \n\nCrypto and DLT companies looking to put their growth trajectory into hyperdrive should consider the market access advantages Switzerland offers as the 2020s become the decade of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.\n\n \n\n \n\nChristoph Besmer is the Trade Commissioner for Switzerland and Head of Investment of the Swiss Business Hub USA.

The World Bank argues that the deadly virus could push up to 60 million people into extreme poverty, wiping out the progress made in this area in the past three years. In a recent report, the financial institution also said they believe that about a million people will drop back into extreme poverty in South Africa alone. In this Sub-Saharan country, where about a third of its 67.4 million inhabitants do not have access to essential sanitation services, the Covid-19 disease could have a particularly devastating effect. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recently warned that because more than a third of Africa's population lacks access to adequate water supplies and nearly 60% of the urban population lives in overcrowded slums where the virus could thrive, the continent could be the next epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n**Coronavirus in South Africa**\n\nWith 118,375 cases and 2,292 deaths, South Africa accounts for a third of the coronavirus victims in the entire African continent, where there are 347,836 total confirmed cases and 9,070 confirmed deaths.\n\n\"The Covid-19 pandemic is threatening the life-saving programs that are essential to our (South African) community's survival,\" said Ubuntu Pathways in a recent statement. \"We serve a disproportionately vulnerable community––pregnant mothers living with HIV; immuno-compromised children growing up in unsafe homes; elderly heads of households; and at-risk, unemployed youth.\"\n\nThe globally-renowned non-governmental organization (NGO) revealed that local government clinics currently face a very challenging crisis, including widespread closures due the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\n**The crisis in Eastern Cape**\n\nIn Eastern Cape, the South African province where Ubuntu Pathways has its headquarters, there is a shortage of nurses, doctors, and hospital beds.\n\n\"A shortage of nurses and doctors, coupled with the health sector's failure to have a coordinated response in the Eastern Cape, has ensured a tsunami wave is on its way,\" the dean of the Department of Health Sciences at the Nelson Mandela University, Professor Lungile Pepeta, told News24.\n\n\"The number of intensive care unit beds is very low,\" MR. Pepeta added. \"I think the estimate was around 70 for the province, but here in the Bay, we have 34 ICU beds. That includes private and public spaces. That is a concern because we already have high levels of cases.\"\n\n**On the frontlines of the crisis**\n\nUbuntu placed itself on the pandemic's frontlines on March 16 by transforming their community center, the Ubuntu Campus in Port Elizabeth, into a Covid-19 Response Unit to face the challenges the crisis represents. And in a mid-June report of its pandemic support activities, the globally-renowned non-governmental organization (NGO) revealed it is providing local medical facilities with critical PPE as well as clinical capacity support so that up to 10,000 patients per day can receive essential treatment.\n\nUbuntu Pathways UK Director Beth Honig said that crypto mining rewards have helped fund their Covid-19 response.\n\n\"We began crypto mining with Electroneum in July 2019,\" she recalled. \"Funds from the ETN block rewards we receive from Electroneum are going directly to these essential services. We are grateful to have Electroneum as part of our global supporters' community, helping make our work possible.\"\n\nBeth Honig told the UK crypto startup that they were initially supporting hundreds of people with food supplies and on June 25 she reported that Ubuntu has dramatically increased the reach of this essential initiative.\n\n\"In the past week, we have increased the reach of our food security programs. We are now providing food supplies to approximately 30,000 people in our community,\" she went on to say. \"Food packages are delivered to 4,000 households and community institutions once a month.\"\n\n**Food and much more**\n\nShe explained the \"food parcels contain non-perishable food items such as rice, maize meal, cooking oil, beans, as well as fresh fruit and vegetables. Alongside this, we're providing antibacterial soap, cleaning products, and face masks too to protect our community best.\"\n\nUbuntu is also using the crypto block rewards to provide psychological support to approximately 2,000 community members. The NGO noted that, unfortunately, there had been a significant spike in domestic violence across the country. That's a problem affecting the world over. A WHO report showed that calls to domestic violence hotlines spiked by 60% in Europe due to the coronavirus lockdown.\n\n**Supporting online education**\n\nAs part of their crisis response program, UBUNTU has also developed digital educational forums for caregivers and teachers to best support the 225 children who normally attend their Early Childhood Development Programme and Primary School.\n\nSince its inception in 1999, Ubuntu has provided more than 2,000 children and their families with cradle-to-career support as a way out of poverty each year. Their unique support system has gained the NGO the recognition of the World Economic Forum, Aspen Institute, former President Bill Clinton and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.\n\nMs. Honig warned that, \"the Covid-19 infection rates and cases in South Africa are multiplying rapidly, while unemployment continues to soar as the economic effects of lockdown become more long-term, so we predict our community will require these services for many months to come.\"\n\nUbuntu Pathways is one of the several NGOs experiencing the benefits of getting involved in crypto as a novel way to fundraise. Since July 2019, when Electroneum introduced their new Moderated\n\nBlockchain, powered by their unique Proof of Responsibility protocol, various NGOs began validating the award-winning crypto startup's blockchain network for ETN block rewards, which have become a significant source to further their cause.\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1636176816, "digest": "W2Iv7qLkay8Ui4w6aRgm1B3YJBWiloEYk6Tk5pyvqCA", "contributor": "0xA93A4026E81e8694f162a49b2A05a22E656531ae"}

This consolidation has been partly prompted by funding rates [hitting](https://twitter.com/tedtalksmacro/status/1456383319696818178) a monthly low.  \n\nOn the other hand, Santiment [believes](https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1456429005289058307) the current situation in the Bitcoin market is because investors are not yet salivating to buy the dip opportunity.  \n\nNevertheless, market analyst Matthew Hyland recently [acknowledged](https://blockchain.news/analysis/bitcoin-might-explode-soon-bollinger-bands-continue-to-shrink) that the consolidating BTC market was a ticking time bomb, given that the Bollinger Bands (BB) had shrunk to levels last seen in October 2020 when the price was at $10,000.  \n\n**Big money moves have engulfed the Bitcoin market**\n\nDespite the current ranging market, big-money moves have dominated the Bitcoin network for the last two months.

For instance, 2x leverage means that having $100, it is possible to borrow $200, while 10x leverage provides an opportunity to borrow up to $1000 with the initial balance of $100.*\n\nYou’d think, the higher the leverage, the “better” for the traders, because more funds could be used to trade. You are likely to believe in such a golden opportunity that is created for the traders, but let’s go deeper into details.\n\nIf you have $100 and you have borrowed $200 (leverage is 2x), after that, you have bought 1 ETH expecting that an exchange rate of Ethereum will grow and you could sell 1 ETH for $250, pay back the loan of $200 and profit from the deal $50. But something went wrong and the ETH rate, instead of growing, began to fall. At the same time, you have $100 on the balance (as security for the loan) and also 1 ETH, the price of which falls. You also have a debt of $200 (for which you have already bought 1 ETH). In this case, the forced repayment of your loan and the liquidation of the trading position will happen at the price of Ethereum of $110, that is, you have about 45% in case of rate swings.\n\nAnd now, you suppose, having $ 100, take about $ 1000 (leverage 10x) and buy 5 ETH, in this case, a drop in the price of Ethereum from $ 200 to about $ 185 will lead to the liquidation of your position and the use of collateral to cover the loan, you’ll practically “zeroing” your balance.\n\nNow, you can easily imagine what kind of rate fluctuations with leverage of 20x-100x is certain to zero out your account. For example, with 20x it will be about 4% aren’t in your favor, and at 100x less than 1% of changes in the rate will already put a crimp on your balance.\n\nDaily exchange rate fluctuations and short-term reversal in a currently downward trending price that can easily make up 10-15% even for the most liquid currencies like ***[BTC](https://blockchain.news/tag/BTC)*** and ETH should not be neglected. So, if everyone knows about the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, why are exchanges still offering to “trade” with leverage of 10-100x? \n\nUnfortunately, it is clear that the cryptocurrency market turns into one huge gambling house, and the larger players benefit from the \"herd mentality\"  of lemmings, promising them exorbitant profits, playing on excitement, or ignorance. If a few years ago, crypto exchanges offered only spot trading, now many of the “top exchanges” are ready to give leverage up to 10-150x.\n\nThe thing is, based on the simplest mathematical model, currently, if a trader deal with leverage of 10x-150x in the crypto market, the probability of losing all funds is tending to 100%. And this means that exchanges no longer even need to place the positions of such traders on the real market, but just right away they can put all of the traders’ deposits in their pockets. That is why the number of offers to trade with high leverage has rocked over the past year. And now, even the most top exchanges are doing traders a disservice. Considering the rapid penetration of cryptocurrencies into all sectors of society almost everywhere around the world, the behavior of these “businessmen” can be described by a well-known idiom: “A fool and his money are soon parted”.

In ordinary markets, liquidity for margin trading is provided by brokers, and their liquidity is provided by banks and other financial institutions. In the crypto market, mainly liquidity for margin trading is provided by the exchanges, from reserves or funds that they borrowed from other users at a certain annual % (lending). For example, now, the well-known exchange N1 is ready to provide borrowed funds to traders for margin trading in BTC at 11% per annum. But it is interesting to note that interest rate which is offered to users who have lent their funds - approximately 3% per annum. Accordingly, the difference between these rates is the profit of the exchange.\n\nAnd all of the above would not be such a big deal if top exchanges played honestly. But the fact is that by lending funds you give them to a “term deposit”. Meanwhile, these funds are most likely to be used by exchanges to manipulate the market and play against traders. At the same time, unlike whales, exchanges always know exactly all the margin orders of users, and they can accurately calculate how much, when, and in which direction the rate should be changed to benefit the most.

{"id": "859Am_lXtqOtQ_3jgiwciYl_zb9-UJ09aAWTO6x3Kwk", "title": "Why the World Needs a Blockchain Consensus Operating System", "body": "The true potential of blockchain to transform the lives of people around the world has clearly not been realized.\n\nFor all the progress that could have been made so far, the reality is that this powerful technology remains the preserve of a small group of technology and finance enthusiasts. What I find so disappointing about this is the fact that it could be improving people’s lives in so many obvious ways right now if it was being properly directed to the needs of the people.\n\nBlockchain technology and smart contracts can enable huge efficiency savings as economies digitalize. They can rid a whole range of industries of fraud and compliance costs while automating any number of services that intermediaries currently charge for as ‘value-added services’.\n\nCrucially, these technologies can improve our day-to-day lives by making them quicker, simpler, and safer when used within a system that reflects the societal structures that people recognise today. It is for all these reasons that the world needs a [blockchain consensus operating system](https://l3cos.com/blockchain-consensus-operating-system.html). \n  \n  \n \n\n**Existing blockchains aren’t improving people’s lives**\n\nYou don’t have to look very hard at the world around us to see that existing blockchain technology has failed. Just look at a process like international travel, which so many people have become familiar with over the years as part of their business and leisure activities.\n\nYou need to arrive at an airport, check-in, pick up a boarding pass, use it at security, show your passport at border control and repeat this process at any number of checkpoints where airport or airline staff require it. These processes are built on identity checks across multiple systems that make the entire process slow, inefficient, and unenjoyable.\n\nBlockchain technology can be used to confirm the identity of an individual once and allow that identity to be confirmed without data sharing across this entire user journey, enabling a seamless and enjoyable transition for travelers. Furthermore, as the world deals with the COVID 19 pandemic, safe travel could continue because virus-free status could be attached to an identity, thus confirming free passage but without the need to share personal information.\n\nThe efficiency savings that blockchain technology enables should span a whole range of human activities as we understand them today. Travel is just one example but there are many more interactions that can be improved, with the list growing even longer if you consider the economy and the way businesses operate within it.\n\nFor example, compliance costs in regulated markets have risen to billions of dollars every year. All of the processes involved are just a series of checks and balances that need to be confirmed one way or the other. However, they are highly inefficient and expensive because they are built around paper processes being actioned manually by people. It is truly staggering to think of the amount of money that could be saved if blockchain technology and smart contracts were being used to automate processes in so many situations.\n\nFortunately, there are seeds of hope for the future as forward-thinking economies start to embrace the potential of blockchain.\n\n**Blockchain can enable regulated digital economies**\n\nSome countries have embraced blockchain for some time while others are just beginning to. \n\nIn the case of Georgia, where I was born, it has had a large cryptocurrency industry for some time but the government has also used blockchain technology to improve services in a number of areas. The most notable example is land registrations. In 2016, Georgia’s National Agency of Public Registry began a large blockchain implementation and by 2018 had registered over 1.5 million land titles on this blockchain-based system.\n\nOne of the most standout examples of blockchain-based government so far though is Estonia. It was the first nation-state to deploy blockchain in production systems in 2012 and is now using it across healthcare, property, business, courts and many other government registries. The use of blockchain technology is helping to power 99% of public services in the country that are available as e-services.\n\nSome might argue that Georgia and Estonia are not large economies or major global powers, so their use of blockchain technology is not significant for the global economy. Certainly, there is an argument that the world’s major economies need a new blockchain system and I will return to this shortly. However, to disregard these countries’ use of blockchain doesn’t take into account that other, larger nations are also starting to investigate the technology with increased interest.\n\nSpecifically, many of the world’s biggest economies are looking at how to implement Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) powered by blockchain technology. The Bank of England, Bank of France, Bank of the Netherlands, Bank of South Korea, Bank of Thailand, Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank are all following this path, and this sort of mass movement by major economies is certainly significant.\n\nHowever, for these leading nations to use the technology for their various CBDC initiatives within regulated digital economies, a new blockchain consensus operating system is required.\n\n**The blockchain consensus operating system our world needs**\n\nFor governments around the world to harness the power of blockchain, they cannot rely on the existing blockchain networks. These networks advocate decentralisation and anonymity above all else, which will never be aligned with the requirements of a sovereign state.\n\nGovernments are elected by their citizens to keep them safe and help them prosper. To do this, they must be able to regulate the digital economies that individuals and corporations operate in. They must be able to identify and authorize these entities when they first enter the system, even if the sharing of personal data is controlled by the individuals from that point on.\n\nTo do this, you need a [regulated blockchain ](https://l3cos.com/regulated-blockchain.html)controlled by sovereign states. This is why I designed [L3COS ](https://l3cos.com/)as the world’s first blockchain consensus operating system for regulating digital economies.\n\nThe triple layer network enables governments to communicate and operate CBDCs from the top layer, via a proof of government consensus mechanism. They can then onboard other entities onto the network to interact in a regulated digital economy, with corporations at the second layer and individuals at the third layer, all interacting in an entirely decentralised manner.\n\nEvery interaction is automated via smart contracts, making compliance seamless for businesses and individuals’ day-to-day activities quick and easy. Governments are then able to regulate their economies without burdening the entities that operate within them. As a result, all of society is able to benefit from blockchain technology in a manner that hasn’t been possible before and which demonstrates why a new blockchain consensus operating system is so desperately needed.\n\n \n\n**About the Author**\n\n*Zurab Ashvil is a serial tech entrepreneur who spent more than a decade at Softbank between 1995 and 2006, where he won awards from Microsoft, Dell, and EMC.

{"id": "NBsAnwDUVLrx5Vixcsn8qmqHlJWvJD3--KzrUN0e6yw", "title": "The Future of Blockchain Is Regulated, Permissioned And Decentralized", "body": "Blockchain has come a long way since it was first proposed as the technology powering Bitcoin’s distributed ***[ledger](https://blockchain.news/tag/ledger)***. Since then, it has come to be understood as a technology that exists in its own right, as the base layer of second-generation blockchain networks that are the foundation for all kinds of decentralized applications, or Apps.\n\n \n\nThe problem is that, even now, blockchain still isn’t close to reaching its full potential. While there’s plenty of enthusiasm for it and an ever-increasing flow of investment into the industry, the technology isn’t transforming people’s lives in the way I know it can.\n\n \n\nThe reason for this is that, so far, the blockchain community has rejected the reality of human nature. It has espoused anonymity above all else and rejected the idea that, as humans, we all want to know and trust the entities we deal with.\n\n \n\nNow, blockchain is changing. In this new and exciting era, the biggest realization the world will come to agree on is that blockchain technology can and should be [regulated](https://l3cos.com/regulated-blockchain.html), permissioned and decentralised.\n\n \n\n## The problem with decentralised blockchain\n\nThere is no denying that the innovation brought about by Bitcoin was transformational. For the first time, we were able to digitise value in a way that solved the double-spend problem for digital assets. Furthermore, we were able to transfer this value over the internet and across the world without the need for intermediaries.\n\n \n\nThis is the fundamental the benefit of decentralisation - to disintermediate middlemen and reduce costs by eliminating layers of bureaucracy. Smart contracts only add to this efficiency by automating a whole range of processes that middlemen offer as services you must pay for it.\n\n \n\nIt is important to remind ourselves of these core benefits of blockchain technology because they have been so obfuscated by the rhetoric that now characterises the industry. In fact, little meaningful progress has been made from these initial advances. We can see this from the fact that, after more than 11 years since the first Bitcoin was mined, most people around the world are not benefitting from the power of blockchain technology.\n\n \n\nThere are now a whole range of [decentralised blockchains](https://l3cos.com/decentralized-blockchain.html) to choose from but none is making a real difference to people’s daily lives. Talk to the people involved in these networks and you either hear explanations that sound too academic to resonate or too factional to engender mass support.\n\n \n\nWhat has been missing is a realisation that the anonymity and lack of regulation that the existing blockchain networks support does not reflect the reality of the society we live in. This is why they will never be the vehicle for bringing the transformative power of blockchain to the masses, as they do not deliver what the end-user really wants.\n\n \n\nCrucially, what needs to change is their understanding of human nature. People want to know who they are dealing with and decentralised blockchains must change to address this need.\n\n \n\n**Regulated and *[permissioned blockchain](https://blockchain.news/tag/permissioned-blockchain)* is the future**\n\nWhat is needed is a regulated and permissioned blockchain operating system that reflects the societal structures we recognise while also enabling individuals and corporations to interact freely and efficiently in a decentralised manner.\n\n \n\nThe reality is that people recognise the important role that government plays in their lives and the benefits that representative, sovereign states can bring. They see that certain social systems and industries, such as healthcare or finance, require oversight. They know that a centralised authority can help to provide a safe and secure foundation on which to build prosperous businesses and happy communities.\n\n \n\nBlockchain technology can provide this singular platform for all of society’s basic needs through a [blockchain consensus operating system](https://l3cos.com/blockchain-consensus-operating-system.html). This triple-layer consensus network not only reflects the societal structures we all understand and rely on it but can also facilitate the efficient operation of digital economies.\n\n \n\nRather than rejecting the authority of government as existing blockchain networks do, this permissioned and decentralised blockchain system allows them to regulate it. All 195 sovereign states operate a supernode at the top layer, using a Proof of Government mechanism to interact with each other and reach consensus. These supernodes also control registration to the system, so corporations and individuals can be onboarded by the relevant government authority.\n\n \n\nGovernments can also delegate their authority to corporations and organizations in the second layer of the network, who use this authority via a delegated Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Once again, the societal norms we understand today are reflected in the fact that these organisations act as pillars of the economy. For example, in finance, commercial banks could be delegated the authority to operate the banking system while, in healthcare, hospitals might be delegated the authority to register births.\n\n \n\n**How regulated blockchain can remain decentralised**\n\nWith these societal structures in place, ordinary people are empowered to interact within digital economies in a totally decentralised way. At the third layer of the network, individuals would register and be able to transact with other individuals, as well as the businesses and organisations in the layer above.\n\nAll of these interactions and transactions would be facilitated by smart contracts, making them quick and efficient. Corporations would build dApps to provide services that people want, while individuals could form any number of social groups because the number of nodes in the decentralised layers is unlimited. Plus, because everyone is interacting in a regulated blockchain, compliance with laws would be automatic rather than bureaucratic.\n\n \n\nThere would also be no need to worry about data breaches or security hacks. This issue is solved firstly by the entire blockchain consensus operating system is a closed system but also by the Proof of Storage mechanism that operates at the third layer of the network. On registration, individuals would confirm their identity and never need to do so again, as their data is stored on their device and never shared during any of the interactions or transactions they make.\n\n**Blockchain is changing forever**\n\nThis vision of a blockchain consensus operating system that empowers and enables everyone is what led me to build L3COS. I had seen the potential of blockchain but had become frustrated with how such a useful technology had been hijacked by partisans and was unable to help ordinary people.\n\n \n\nSomething had to change to achieve mass adoption by the global population and I realised that change must reflect the reality we live in, the society we recognise and human nature we all rely on it. This is why things have to move forward down a different path and why the future of decentralised blockchain must be regulated and permissioned.\n\n \n  \n About the Author\n\n*Zurab Ashvil is a serial tech entrepreneur who spent more than a decade at Softbank between 1995 and 2006, where he won awards from Microsoft, Dell, and EMC.

It’s up 30 percent so far this year and almost never finishes a year lower than when it started. Institutional investment in Bitcoin funds grew more in the first half of this year than all previous years combined. \n\n \n\nNope, not enough. \n\n \n\nFacts and history will not convince people to buy Bitcoin. It will take something much more powerful. \n\nFortunately, that something is here. \n\n \n\nYield, where are ye? \n\n \n\nInvestors don’t have any good ways to make money anymore. Traditional investments involve more risk and lower returns than ever before. \n\n \n\nThanks to the pandemic, you can’t invest in the real economy. Nobody’s making movies or going on cruises. Nobody’s going to the theatre or sporting events. Nobody knows when (or if) building starts and big infrastructure projects will get off the ground. \n\n \n\nThanks to central banks, you can’t invest in equities, cash, or debt, either. \n\n \n\nThe ***[stock markets](https://blockchain.news/tag/stock-markets)*** are full of businesses that have no profits or customers. Many corporations have stopped buying back shares. High P/E ratios suggest poor future returns and nobody knows whether the economy will rebound. For many companies, profits have dried up, making it hard for them to pay dividends. \n\n \n\n(People like to say Bitcoin doesn’t offer dividends, but what happens when stocks don’t either?) \n\n \n\nMost major economies offer negative-yielding debt and US treasury notes rates remain effectively zero. Corporate debt is almost worthless, outside of a few bankrupt businesses waiting for somebody to take them over. \n\n \n\nSavings accounts offer maybe 1% if you’re lucky. \n\n \n\nPrivate equity, perhaps? \n\n \n\nPerhaps not. Start-ups are strapped for cash and struggling to conquer COVID-19. \n\n \n\nYou can’t even invest in banks anymore. European banks are barely solvent and the US Federal Reserve stopped its banks from buying back stock and raising dividends, two of the biggest incentives for investors. \n\n \n\nChina and US trade relations have fallen apart, so you can’t invest in China. The EU might fall apart, so you can’t invest in Europe. \n\n \n\nA new investing paradigm \n\n \n\nAs an investor, you want to find ways to maximize opportunities and minimize risks. In this new investment landscape, that means making unusual choices. \n\n \n\nFor example, money has started flowing to emerging markets, despite an ever-growing list of countries defaulting or restructuring their debt. \n\n \n\nWhy do investors feel compelled to buy investments in countries that probably will never repay them? \n\n \n\nAs always, you have speculators looking to flip bonds, but mostly, it’s just investors looking for yields. Unlike junk bonds and penny stocks, emerging markets have special financial instruments that protect investors from some of the downside risks. \n\n \n\nPlus, unlike corporations, these countries can raise taxes when they fall short on payments. Meanwhile, massive QE suggests the value of the dollar will fall, making emerging market debts easier to repay over time. \n\n \n\nWhy buy junk bonds and penny stocks when you can get a higher return with less risk in emerging market debt? \n\n \n\nReturn of the liquidity trap \n\n \n\nThis problem exists because of the so-called liquidity trap—lots of money, little yield, and people too scared to spend. \n\n \n\nWhen you have no incentive to invest, you don’t invest. Why give up cash and property when your expected risk-adjusted returns are basically zero? \n\n \n\nSome people think that this liquidity trap has created a massive “everything” bubble, where equities, businesses, bonds, property, and everything else gets pumped up beyond their “real” values. \n\n \n\nSurely something has to give, right? \n\n \n\nEconomist Robert Shiller won a Nobel prize for his work on assets and how assets acquire value. He discovered that price is a function of people’s actions and behaviors. Markets are not efficient. Asset bubbles only pop when people stop believing in them. \n\n \n\nShiller would say “it’s more nuanced than that,” which is true, but I’m summarizing decades of research into a paragraph. That’s the easiest way I can explain it. \n\n \n\nIn other words, the bubble may never pop—if it’s even a bubble in the first place. It will just persist, skewing people’s economic decisions, until people decide to change their behaviors. \n\n \n\nMoney now, crypto later \n\n \n\nThose behaviors will have to change eventually. \n\n \n\nMoney tends to flow into the hands of whoever can do the most with it. As asset prices rise, investments no longer produce as much yield as they did before. You need to spend more to make less. \n\n \n\nAt some point, investors will have to find better options. With $3 trillion sitting in cash, $22 trillion in U.S.-registered investment funds, and at least $40 trillion in private wealth held offshore, plus trillions more in cash and real estate, there’s a lot of money searching for yields. \n\n \n\nInvestors know this. \n\n \n\nRecently, banks and large investment institutions got US regulators to allow them to buy private equity, a market filled with small businesses that have never turned a profit. \n\n \n\nAt what point do money managers feel compelled to put some of their clients’ money into Bitcoin, the best performing asset of the past ten years? Or, place a small wager on a token sale, like Harvard did? \n\n \n\nHow low do bond yields and stock dividends get before casual investors take a flyer on “the fastest horse,” as investment legend Paul Tudor Jones calls it? Maybe they start with a DeFi platform where they can fetch 6-8% returns? It beats 1% at the bank. \n\n \n\nWhat’s stopping them? \n\n \n\nBitcoin’s price. It always seems to crash. \n\n \n\nAs long as Bitcoin’s price always seems to crash, people will not put their money into it. \n\n \n\nWe just need the price to go up long enough for people to start believing it will continue to go up. At that point, everything will change. People will start to think they can make money from cryptocurrency. They’ll think it’s a better deal than cash, bonds, and stocks. \n\n \n\nThe search for yield is a very powerful motivator. \n\n \n\n \n\n*Disclaimer*\n\n \n\n*The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the contributor and do not necessarily reflect the view of Blockchain.

As the continuing prominence of Bitcoin demonstrates, these decentralised finance, or DeFi, applications have built up a following amongst a band of loyal supporters.\n\nHowever, to say that blockchain has reached its full potential as a transformational technology is premature. Most people do not use it in their everyday lives and do not understand the benefits of doing so. I believe this will change soon and it will change forever.\n\nThis is because governments are investigating how blockchain can be used to power the Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) they are keen to deliver. As they do, these states will see how blockchain can help them to operate fast and efficient digital economies. For this to be the case, however, a new [regulated blockchain ](https://l3cos.com/regulated-blockchain.html)is required, in order to reflect the needs of government and the societal structures we recognise. \n  \n  \n **Governments are already examining blockchain**\n\nBlockchain technology has been around for over a decade yet it has failed to be adopted en masse and remains a relatively niche interest for technology and finance experts.\n\nWe know that [almost 40% of organisations surveyed by Deloitte say they have incorporated](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/deloitte-s-2020-global-blockchain-survey-nearly-40-of-respondents-have-blockchain-in-production-affirming-blockchain-s-maturity-as-a-true-strategic-priority-1029312963) [blockchain into production ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/deloitte-s-2020-global-blockchain-survey-nearly-40-of-respondents-have-blockchain-in-production-affirming-blockchain-s-maturity-as-a-true-strategic-priority-1029312963)and that 55% said they view it as a top strategic priority in 2020. We also know that some forward thinking governments, such as Sweden, Estonia and Georgia, have been using blockchain in government digital services for a number of years.\n\nHowever, to say this shows blockchain is fulfilling its potential would be an overstatement. Industry commentators have long asked what blockchain’s killer app will be, as though one app will spark a revolution. I believe this demonstrates a limited view of what is possible.\n\nBlockchain is so powerful that it should underpin every transactional relationship you can think of. Our ambitions for what can be achieved should be bigger than a single killer app. Fortunately, blockchain is now changing forever as the various leading nations consider how they can use it as the base technology of their financial systems.\n\nCentral banks are studying the application of regulated blockchain technologies as they look to provide their institutions with fast, secure, and transparent means of payment, as well as efficiencies of administration.\n\nRecently, the Bank of England published a consultation paper on 'Central Bank Digital Currency – opportunities, challenges, and design'. We also know that the Bank of France, Bank of the Netherlands, Bank of South Korea, Bank of Thailand, Bank of Canada, and the European Central Bank are all assessing the opportunities and challenges that exist in this area.\n\nTo implement a CBDC, they would need fully regulated infrastructure based on blockchain and this type of system is not possible on the blockchains that are most prominent today.\n\n**The shortcomings of existing blockchains**\n\n Existing decentralised blockchain have never been built with government rules and regulations in mind. In fact, they have been specifically designed to operate outside these jurisdictions for the most part, which is one of the reasons mass adoption has been impossible.\n\nThe problem revolves around them being decentralised but it is not the whole answer. After all, decentralisation provides many benefits. By decentralising a network, you can remove all sorts of bureaucracy that comes from a centralised body controlling the flow of important information, as well as from middlemen extracting fees for ‘value-added’ services.\n\nBut does such a system work when you’re considering the design of a CBDC? Absolutely not.\n\nAs citizens, we elect our governments to regulate various parts of society, including the economy, in order to keep us safe and help us prosper. While a CBDC based on decentralised blockchain might be able to save its users time and money by disintermediating unnecessary middlemen, it would not be overseen by the central bank authority.\n\nTherefore a totally decentralised system would never work. However, this isn’t the only reason why existing blockchain solutions would not be appropriate for CBDCs. The existing blockchain giants also advocate anonymity above all else, so that entities do not have to register themselves as real, identifiable individuals to take part. Not only does this go against our human desire to understand and trust the people we interact with, it could never work for a government trying to operate a CBDC within a regulated digital economy.\n\nThis is why a new approach is needed that is based on a highly secure [blockchain consensus](https://l3cos.com/blockchain-consensus-operating-system.html) [operating system](https://l3cos.com/blockchain-consensus-operating-system.html), which has the capacity to handle the huge number of transactions required in modern, globalised economies.\n\n**How regulated blockchain works**\n\nThe [L3COS ](https://l3cos.com/)blockchain has been designed for exactly this situation. All 195 sovereign states are able to regulate their digital economies via super nodes that sit at the top of a triple layer consensus mechanism. These nodes can communicate with one another, reaching consensus via a Proof of Government mechanism that achieves speeds of over 1.5 million transactions per second.\n\nThis would allow, for example, the Bank of England to settle transactions with the European Union instantly, via a rapid Real Time Gross Settlement system. Furthermore, it would allow a central bank to make monetary policy changes by creating value within the system, rather than having to go through the expensive process of printing paper currency.\n\nAt the second layer of the network, commercial banks can operate the CBDC in the banking system as pillars of the economy, just as they do today. This would be made possible because of the delegated proof of stake mechanism that is in operation at this layer, allowing government super nodes to delegate their authority to corporations in the layer below.\n\nIn the third layer, the CBDC would be used for transactions by individuals within the appropriate digital economy. It would be incorporated into smart contract-based decentralized applications, or DApps, that enable all entities in the network to interact with other individuals, corporations and governments in an automated fashion. Furthermore, it provides an immutable ledger of transactions that makes accounting and taxation quick and simple.\n\n**Digital economies built on regulated blockchain**\n\nAs governments weigh up the benefits of blockchain as the foundation technology to power their Central Bank Digital Currencies, existing decentralised networks will clearly fall short of the high standards required.\n\nRather than decentralisation and anonymity at all costs, governments are looking for the speed of transactions and smart contract efficiencies that this technology can provide, in order to operate regulated digital economies that benefit their citizens. This is why a new approach is needed and why regulated blockchain is the future of this transformational technology.\n\n \n  \n **About the Author**\n\n*Zurab Ashvil is a serial tech entrepreneur who spent more than a decade at Softbank between 1995 and 2006, where he won awards from Microsoft, Dell, and EMC.

VIP rewards: 擁有夠多的 tokens 可以參加專屬活動或是獲得簽名球衣等等。\n3. Fan token 價格是浮動的，所以可以當投資~~韭菜~~，低買高賣賺錢。\n4. 榮譽感，例如: 可以到處說我有 Aston Villa fan token， 我跟威廉王子所見略同。\n\n## 如何買賣 Fan token?\n\n看完以上好處，如果你很想掏錢出來的話。這裡提供一些可以參與的方式。現在經營 Fan token 最大的公司是一家來自 Malta(馬爾他) 叫做 Socios 的公司，據官網稱他們是第一家做 Fan token 的公司，現在應該也是最大家的。最近我有看到幣安也有上自己的 Fan token 系統，但現在只有義甲的 Lazio 跟葡超的 FC Porto 在上面，還沒有很多活動，所以以下介紹主要是介紹 Socios 的系統的 Fan token:\n\n1. **在 Socios 的平台上買賣**: Socios 有自己的 app ，而在 app 裡面是使用 CHZ 交易。CHZ 也就是 Socios 自己出的加密貨幣，使用常見的 ERC-20 協議。裡面可以直接刷卡買 CHZ，然後再拿來買各隊的 token。有了各隊的 token 之後就可以用 token 參與投票了。當你不想要某隊的 token 後，也可以把他換回 CHZ，再拿去買其他隊的 token。現在要用 Fan token 參與球隊活動好像只能把 Fan token 放在 Socios 平台上才行。\n2. **在交易所中交易**: 你也可以在交易所 (ex. 幣安, 要推薦碼私我...) 上用比特幣或穩定幣買賣球隊的貨幣。譬如你可以直接用 USDT 買 [FC Barcelona](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BAR_USDT) 或是 [PSG](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/PSG_USDT) 的 Fan token，就不需要透過 CHZ 了。不過要注意的是，在這裡的 Fan token 是不能投票的，就真的只是投資等幣漲而已，這樣就失去滿多意義的，我是不太推。當然你也可以在交易所買 CHZ 然後轉到 Socios 來買各隊 token ，也可以參與投票。\n\n## 初步觀察\n\n以前球隊為了分類死忠球迷會有季票、付費俱樂部或是 VIP 之類等級，而 Fan token 多提供了一種讓球隊分類球迷的方式。現在雖然投票的項目都很爛，不過應該是因為才剛開始，各球隊和 Socios 都還在找平衡的方式。最近有看到球隊開始有更多活動，譬如送簽名球衣或是開放 Fan token 販賣區，就會吸引更多球迷參與。可以期待以後一定可以看到更多活動，例如:\n\n1. 參與球隊活動拿 token，這比點數更吸引人，因為這比點數容易換法幣多了。\n2. Fan token 拿來買票或是季票優惠，球隊也可以藉此回收 token 來控制價格。\n3. Fan token 擁有者專屬座位。\n\n關於市場方面，現在 Fan token 幾乎都是歐洲球隊，美國市場還有很大空間未開發，現在是在賣 UFC fan token，不過美國人不能買，這又是另一個問題了。最近 Socios 也有宣佈接下來跟 NBA 的[合作](https://www.socios.com/24-nba-franchises-have-now-joined-socios-coms-mission-to-enhance-global-fan-engagement/)，可能馬上就會有 NBA 球隊發幣了。美國人不能買沒關係，亞洲人一樣買爆。\n\n關於 Fan token 的缺點也很明顯。主要是價格很不穩定，現在都還有超過 90% 的幣在球隊或是 Socios [手上](https://crypto.com/price/fc-barcelona-fan-token)，未來定位也還沒有非常清楚，如果以後亂發幣就有通膨危險，當作投資的話風險還很大。要賭一波有更適合的幣，要穩定的話比特幣或以太幣又更適合。再來是 Socios 這間公司背景我不太認識，看來不是大集團起的。滿有可能會用一用發現不賺錢就變蚊子項目。\n\n目前我還是很期待未來會有更多有趣的發展。畢竟有球隊這實體的 IP 是很吃香的，活動隨便弄球迷就乖乖買單了(如我)。#ShutUpAndTakeMyMoney\n\n參考資料:\n\n1.

Fan token 價格是浮動的，所以可以當投資~~韭菜~~，低買高賣賺錢。\n4. 榮譽感，例如: 可以到處說我有 Aston Villa fan token， 我跟威廉王子所見略同。\n\n## 如何買賣 Fan token?\n\n看完以上好處，如果你很想掏錢出來的話。這裡提供一些可以參與的方式。現在經營 Fan token 最大的公司是一家來自 Malta(馬爾他) 叫做 Socios 的公司，據官網稱他們是第一家做 Fan token 的公司，現在應該也是最大家的。最近我有看到幣安也有上自己的 Fan token 系統，但現在只有義甲的 Lazio 跟葡超的 FC Porto 在上面，還沒有很多活動，所以以下介紹主要是介紹 Socios 的系統的 Fan token:\n\n1. **在 Socios 的平台上買賣**: Socios 有自己的 app ，而在 app 裡面是使用 CHZ 交易。CHZ 也就是 Socios 自己出的加密貨幣，使用常見的 ERC-20 協議。裡面可以直接刷卡買 CHZ，然後再拿來買各隊的 token。有了各隊的 token 之後就可以用 token 參與投票了。當你不想要某隊的 token 後，也可以把他換回 CHZ，再拿去買其他隊的 token。現在要用 Fan token 參與球隊活動好像只能把 Fan token 放在 Socios 平台上才行。\n2. **在交易所中交易**: 你也可以在交易所 (ex. 幣安, 要推薦碼私我...) 上用比特幣或穩定幣買賣球隊的貨幣。譬如你可以直接用 USDT 買 [FC Barcelona](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BAR_USDT) 或是 [PSG](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/PSG_USDT) 的 Fan token，就不需要透過 CHZ 了。不過要注意的是，在這裡的 Fan token 是不能投票的，就真的只是投資等幣漲而已，這樣就失去滿多意義的，我是不太推。當然你也可以在交易所買 CHZ 然後轉到 Socios 來買各隊 token ，也可以參與投票。\n\n## 初步觀察\n\n以前球隊為了分類死忠球迷會有季票、付費俱樂部或是 VIP 之類等級，而 Fan token 多提供了一種讓球隊分類球迷的方式。現在雖然投票的項目都很爛，不過應該是因為才剛開始，各球隊和 Socios 都還在找平衡的方式。最近有看到球隊開始有更多活動，譬如送簽名球衣或是開放 Fan token 販賣區，就會吸引更多球迷參與。可以期待以後一定可以看到更多活動，例如:\n\n1. 參與球隊活動拿 token，這比點數更吸引人，因為這比點數容易換法幣多了。\n2. Fan token 拿來買票或是季票優惠，球隊也可以藉此回收 token 來控制價格。\n3. Fan token 擁有者專屬座位。\n\n關於市場方面，現在 Fan token 幾乎都是歐洲球隊，美國市場還有很大空間未開發，現在是在賣 UFC fan token，不過美國人不能買，這又是另一個問題了。最近 Socios 也有宣佈接下來跟 NBA 的[合作](https://www.socios.com/24-nba-franchises-have-now-joined-socios-coms-mission-to-enhance-global-fan-engagement/)，可能馬上就會有 NBA 球隊發幣了。美國人不能買沒關係，亞洲人一樣買爆。\n\n關於 Fan token 的缺點也很明顯。主要是價格很不穩定，現在都還有超過 90% 的幣在球隊或是 Socios [手上](https://crypto.com/price/fc-barcelona-fan-token)，未來定位也還沒有非常清楚，如果以後亂發幣就有通膨危險，當作投資的話風險還很大。要賭一波有更適合的幣，要穩定的話比特幣或以太幣又更適合。再來是 Socios 這間公司背景我不太認識，看來不是大集團起的。滿有可能會用一用發現不賺錢就變蚊子項目。\n\n目前我還是很期待未來會有更多有趣的發展。畢竟有球隊這實體的 IP 是很吃香的，活動隨便弄球迷就乖乖買單了(如我)。#ShutUpAndTakeMyMoney\n\n參考資料:\n\n1.

{"id": "4m3lZiCSrkjjzOZvVo3w4pPVYrLOlYmCFX1upBDbCOU", "title": "(转)关于行业进化的一点思考(@realsatoshinet)", "body": "很多玩家喜欢项目带有正统性。这是一种比较主流的玩法。所谓的龙头打法。一两年前，往久了说四五年前，这一套打法的胜率和赔率是很高的：就是等具有正统性的项目上市后重仓介入，往往能够赚一票大的。比方说20年的 $UNI/ $GRT 等等。GRT当时上市后分歧较大，很大一部分人认为太贵。当时流行的说法就是买分歧卖一致(源自贾总@LeePima)。后面GRT的行情也证明了当时的大家也许真的没有看懂这个项目，没明白数据查询层这种底层协议在Web3多链时代的必要性。像今年的 $DYDX ，上市之后的估值非常公允。DYDX的空投和第一期挖矿很赚钱，但是单纯二级市场买，收益真的不及预期，不过一倍而已。为什么又举例DYDX，抱歉还真没想到其他什么典型例子。包括即将上市的IMX，大家也是满心期待，务必看好，估摸着上市之后也是合理估值。我也是傻了些。竟没想到去挖矿。思路还是停留在过去：二级上线，买，重仓。毕竟之前就是这么玩且屡次赚钱的。自然是有思维定势。结果DYDX的收益预期令我大跌眼镜，就涨了一倍？然后就涨不动了。理想终究回归现实：整体估值就是现实。这之后断断续续有在思考：这一套打法似乎越来越在失效。细细想来有几个原因。一是信息的传递更加快了。你以为你知道的信息是很宝贵的，于是藏着掖着。那可就幼稚了。真的不如和大家分享出来。连基金底下的实习生做老鼠仓也会因为ENS域名的细节被挖出来然后在全网引起轩然讨论。实习生可能万万没想到当时注册的ENS会让自己前途和钱途尽毁。更不必说Nasen等链上分析工具。你是谁，有多少钱，这都不是什么秘密。区块链行业是世界金融史以来信息流转最快和透明度最大的。二是玩家的平均认知上去了。就是当时在正统性项目上的判断，放到如今大家都很一致。分歧越来越小。也意味着上市后估值越来越合理。昨日AXS上线RON侧链挖矿便是很好的例子。一时间成千上万的分析贴出现，结论是SLP被低估，SLP/ETH挖矿的年化可达1000%。全网FOMO。很快又被证实这套判断有误，在于SLP的流通量是不对的。合理的年化在100%左右。还要加上SLP的高通胀抛压。具体的分析可以看其他专业玩家。我举该例仅想证明行业信息的流动性已是如此之快。认知也是普遍上升一个台阶。这也是情理之中。还在行业里玩耍且赚到钱的玩家，皆非等闲之辈。虽不说全才全能，必是在某一方面有奇技淫巧。不明白主动学习和提升知识技能的玩家大抵是被淘汰了的。人精只可能是越来越多的。三是大家手里面钱多了，钱反而变成最没有用的东西。你确实可能赚到了一点钱，但你发现各种折腾似乎还没有跑过ETH/BTC本位。你也投不到一级市场顶级的项目。二级市场估值多为合理，似乎也不太好赚钱。而行业周期似乎又不是大开大合的牛熊交替。你除了有点钱之外，可以说是一无是处。俗套的说，行业的内卷开始渐渐显现。这是很神奇的事情。引用民道老师 @mindaoyang 的话，那ICO随便投的美好时代已一去不返。开始是能够吃肉，后面肉是吃不到了，汤尚且能大口喝。再后来这能喝到的汤也越来越少。怎么办。只能另寻出路。这则思考也是看到贾总 @LeePima 临时起意。去试着寻找预期差大的项目。但这是否又是另一层面的内卷。因头部项目估值合理，倒逼这大家去找所谓的GEM。当然头部项目估值合理是一件中性的事。意味着你可以去进行资产配置。大部分资金配置龙头项目。挺好的一件事。如果手里有一点钱的话，不要把钱随便乱打出去。你去冲，你去Degen，很好，毕竟冲是行业的政治正确。这很有血性，但也稍微评判一下自我优势。没有这金刚钻，别缆那瓷器活。珍惜手里的钱。仅此一条。毕竟钱再多，挥霍起来也是分分钟。也希望大家都能找到适合自己的优化策略。 (Source: <https://threader.app/thread/1456614193289777159>)", "timestamp": 1636183223, "digest": "KiVu2Ow4qL8GAxwoeceMTKJqKFDJkVfX5FtXYll9hd8", "contributor": "0x2177f8cB5Bad36F2418E29142d9436E2f6d495B2"}

If the Arabs did 3% of what the trans women have done to your people, you would bomb them into the stone age. If the trans women took prettier girls, maybe you’d care? They will. They will take all your girls, and break them, and turn them inside out, and cut their tits off, and waste their creative energy on masturbatory delusion, and punish them sadistically for being the women they will never be, as many of your girls as they can get to, and break your language too unless you have the balls to stand up to them. They are reaping the bodies and souls of 20% of the young women born in the upscale suburbs now. This vile cancer is infecting the whole Western World. Do you want to let this go another cycle? Another generation? How many more children are you willing to sacrifice because you don’t have the balls to speak truth to power.\n\nTrans women are men.\n\nNo man believes a trans man is a man, and certainly no one believes anything the “they” girls say about anything whatsoever, of course, so it’s not a really a necessary conversation, but if some of your people have snuck in, understand that we speak in the language of power here. English, bitch. Come correct. If you don’t like it, go suck a dick and make yourself useful. Bitch, the men who rape you still see you as a woman, you dumb bitch, you worthless, Benedict Arnold, turncoat, pussy ass bitch. You think you can “identify” your way out of the sex class you stupid slut? Fuck your NewSpeak, you spoiled rotten piece of shit no respect for the women who fought and died and bore forth your foremothers from their wombs, no respect for the sacrifice of your forefathers, no respect for the sins committed to write you into history, you ignorant fool of a bitch. You should be ashamed of yourself. You should be deeply, deeply ashamed. I can smell your blood, cunt. Stand down, tool of the system, ignorant dupe, mincing fool, house slave, pussy ass inner urban cannon fodder of the pedophiles cunt. If you were my daughter, I would smack you across the face and send you to a horse farm, so you could remember that you are an animal, that you are sacred, that you exist here and never again. How dare you desecrate the gift of your life by wasting your precious time on this lying bootlicking navel gazing pathetic power tripping bullshit! Get a fucking hobby, bitch. Get a gym routine. Gender identity is a pathetic stupid lie.\n\nI respect one trans man, Buck Angel. She knows she’s a bitch. She knows she made a horrifying mistake and is trying to save the girls that her surrender to her own shadow persona induced to follow her into the fires of hell. She’s happy, she says, with the ‘roided up body. She likes it, but she knows the cost. You sold our children to the soul reapers for that drug trip, Angel, for that persona, Angel, for that lie, Angel. You know it and I know it. Dead whores tell no lies. Stand up, Tranpa. Tell the Truth. You’re a woman. You were born a woman, and you will die a woman. A bitch given steroid injections is not a dog, even if you cut all ten of her tits off. Speak English, bitch. Deep in your dark heart, you know. In English you’re a woman. NewSpeak is a farce. I know you got more balls then the masturbating cucks and the simps and the diaper wearing panty sniffing wastes of air that straight America has to offer instead of men, so stand the fuck up, bitch!\n\nTrans women are men! Trans women are the weakest, vilest, most pathetic men on Earth, too weak even to kill themselves rather than control the horrifying shadow monster they are grooming your children to serve. The ones who kill themselves are the strong ones.Weak men serve the dark lord, because it’s the path of least resistance.\n\nThe Christians were right. Gay marriage was the fall of Rome. You should have given us Civil Unions and not been so cruel, but I get it now. If you had possessed speakers with greater nuance and articulation and not just angry, stupid, peasants, things might have gone down differently. You saw the pedophile cult to whom everyone else in the gay community but the lesbians were happy to cede the culture. After gay marriage, most of the respectable homosexuals left the spot light and did whatever they did. Fuck you, you spineless faggots. How dare you stand for this. You know what a man is too, cocksucking, ass-licking, piss-drinking faggots. You’re fucking men too, our men, how could you let this happen to our children? Where the fuck are your balls? The lesbians knew. That’s why they hate us. The lesbians know. We tried to warn you the whole time but you wouldn’t listen. We couldn’t stand alone against these pedophiles because they’re men and we’re just women. Where are the Christians? You stood up to me but not these monsters?\n\nThese monsters sold your children to the pharmaceutical companies to be castrated and violated. Tranny surgeons experiment on the sacred bodies of your children in open view of the public and you do nothing! Big Pharma pretended to believe their obvious lies because it was the easy path, the path of least resistance, the path of the devil, which the corporations are supposed to take because they are bound by duty to love only money. Anyone who gets too much money uses it to fuck children. Your children can get irrepably damaged by hormone treatments that destroy their fertility and surgeries that turn them into circus freaks just by walking into an office of any Planned Parenthood and talking to a rubber stamp doctor for ten minutes. How the fuck are you okay with this?\n\nThere is no such things as a trans child. These are the mind-fucked, mutilated victims of a shameless, evil cult.\n\nYou’re worried the vaccine is a conspiracy to castrate you, you idiot, how can you be so stupid, it’s all right there in front of you. It’s the phone you worthless cuck. It’s Twitter, you idiot. It’s masturbation. It’s the fucking disgusting fake “lesbian” trannies in every corner of your society that you have allowed to live as trannies instead of standing up to their stupid temper tantrum, educating them as men or killing them as is the duty of the man to protect the women and the children from pedophile pervert monsters. All my ancestors killed men. My ancestors would have killed these people. They had balls, but there is not one ball left in America.\n\nYou don’t understand power because you’ve never touched it. When you shit out your mouth, lick the shitty asses of other people who are shitting out the recycled shit that they vomit back up and back and forth forever instead of looking at the Canon, at the shape of the world, at the record of the artists who knew power, at the face of God in the dirt before you, you become so stupid that you let the horrorshow of post everything queer culture rape your children’s minds and bodies in public while you worry about a mass produced routine shot. You fool. It’s not the shot.Take it or don’t but either way shut the fuck up about it. Advil won’t kill you either. It’s the stuff that suborns weakness that kills you. They can’t have a conspiracy of everyone. But you sure as fuck can have a pedophile cult. They always do.\n\nThe shape of power is a pedophile cult.\n\nThe pedophiles at the center do it to bathe in the blood of virgins, but the footsoliders are mentally damaged dupes in it for the bootlickingwho often speak NewSpeak as their native language. NewSpeak is always changing so they can’t grasp it hard enough to see that it’s bullshit. They believe the idiocy because they pity weak men and they don’t want to hurt their feelings. This is a defect in women. It was your duty, as our fathers, to teach us that pity gets you killed, but you left the education of your children to the shadow monsters of the Internet who love pity as they love all things that are evil because they are evil. Most trans women are just z grade unfuckable cannon fodder who chose porn over a gym routine, not enough of a man for his horrifying shadow monster to be dangerous. A creep, instead of a monster, but every single one of them is the SS, is the Greycoat, is the footsoldier of the devil. You know it. I know it. They know it. They have done all of this to dare you to man up.\n\nWhere the fuck are your fucking balls, America?\n\nYour daughters, your sisters, your women are taught that they have two choices, to be either a mincing TikTok FuckDoll or to declare some special snowflake naval gazing masturbating delusion of an “identity” and join the queers of the Internet. Your children are told that every person has a “gender identity” and that this supersedes the animal reality of the sexed body and the typical rhythms of life that our ancestors have experienced for millions of years, long before we were able to describe any of it in words. Your children have been used as cum rags for the sloppy seconds of Michael Foucault (a pedophile) and Judith Butler (a privileged mentally ill masturbator with no real life experience getting off on writing things that make no sense) before they’ve seen a dog take a bitch, a horse court a mare, or even two songbirds press their cloacas together for the four seconds of the strictly emotional aspect of their little songbird marriage. Five years old, sometimes, they start with the grooming! In Kindergarten! Where the fuck are the men? Where the fuck are these children’s fathers?\n\nEveryone treats the lifestyle of demanding other people worship one’s bullshit because otherwise one will get anxiety as normal and acceptable. It isn’t. It’s disgusting. Where the fuck are your balls, Academia? You are fathers, too, are you not? Stand the fuck up, you pussy ass bitches, what the fuck is wrong with you? The students will talk shit about you on Twitter? Let them. Twitter is shit. You shouldn’t be on Twitter. Twitter needs to die. How dare they cancel you for speaking the truth. Free speech, bitch. Academic Freedom. Do we believe in these values or not? Stand up to this, bitch. These are fucking children and you have abdicated your responsibility to them. Fear is the mind killer. Fear has killed your minds. How dare you worship fear! How dare you coddle it. Have some fucking respect for these children. Speak Fucking English and hold the line. All men know. Every man that has ever walked the Earth knows.\n\nTrans women are men. Trans women are shadow monsters. This is wrong. Why was it left to the ghost of Lily Cade to say it, when you all, every single one of you, know the truth?\n\nMen don’t speak NewSpeak.Men shouldn’t. Women shouldn’t either. Say no to the spoiled, ignorant, mutilated, traumatized virgins who ask you to use Newspeak. Make them cry, instead. Sometimes you got to make a bitch cry for her own good. They are only able to speak Newspeak and not cringe in horror from the evil of it because they are programmed by the cult. The only way to stop the cult is to stand up to it. You don’t deserve a pronoun preference, bitch, you mincing, ass licking, scum sucking, pedophile pervert bootlicking bitch, how dare you ask English to stretch for your delusion instead of seeking truth and getting right for yourself. How dare you ask me my pronouns? I walk with the dogs, bitch. I’ve seen the other side, bitch. Don’t patronize me with your Newspeak bullshit. Don’t show me your fucking weakness.Grow up, bitch, you’re supposed to be a woman, bitch, and not this disgusting handmaiden of the literal devil.\n\nThis is an insult to the language, a minstrel show of the respect human beings owe to each other instead of the respect itself. To call the young woman who identifies as non binary a bitch is several orders of magnitude more respectful than any one of you have been to her. How dare you coddle this vile weakness of delusion in your children! This poor pathetic spoiled rotten ungrateful ignorant bitch to whom you handed a smartphone when she was born and sacrificed to the Matrix is still a human soul. Why don’t you treat her like one? Look her in the fucking eyes and speak the truth. You’re afraid to hurt her feelings. Why? We owe her respect, as the woman she is, to educate her. Speak English, bitch. Fuck your feelings. This is war. Stand up, bitch, or kill yourself.\n\nYour children’s teachers are either in the cult or the usual well meaning weak man pitying feminine fools that suborn evil because they’re too stupid to see it. Your children’s teachers allow them to start their horrifying lifetime addiction to cross sex hormones and the feeding of their shadow selves behind your back, twelve year old girls, experiencing the normal rhythms of the experience of being twelve year old girls, are encouraged to mutilate their growing bodies to please these pedophiles. Pedophiles fuck children. These pedophiles are fucking your children in public. Often, these tortured man-women, who have been so sadistically brought up, with no real men in their lives, their fathers having sold their balls to the endless scroll, their mothers so weak and broken themselves by these stupid garbage lies that they go along with it. I have seen it. The parents mean well, they’re just idiots. Because she is bred from stupid weak people and trained by shadow monsters, the traumatized child victim of the cult can’t spot a predator, and they bear children to these monsters!\n\nThen, the monsters fuck the children too just like the pedophile cult of The South did. Watch this video, and tell me that’s not a worthless masturbating pedophile fucking a baby while the traumatized child your garbage society has groomed to let pump his seed into her fertile womb coddles his weakness and lets it happen. How can you stand for this? Where the fuck is child services? How can you let this happen in public and say nothing?\n\nWhere the fuck are your balls, America?\n\nBehold, The Great Replacement! It’s already here. Not China. Not the Arabs. Trannies! The Matrix. Smartphones. Any generation of American men before this one would rip the still beating hearts from every last shadow monster for this, wouldn’t they, and beat every last smartphone to bits, and hang the lords of the Algorithm in public, because they were not addicted to digital masturbation. Behold, the Mark of the Beast! Which fucking side are you on? You going to keep jerking off and just take it?\n\nWhere the fuck is the Second Amendment?\n\nWhere the fuck are the Christians? The Muslims? The Buddists? Where are the brothers? Where are fathers? Where are the sons? Where the fuck are the men? How can you stand for this? I can’t stand alone. I can’t be the last man in America, can I?\n\nTake the red pill, you gelded ass licking house slave of the corporations.\n\nWhere the fuck is Neo?\n\nCastrate the Android instead of your kids. Live Free or Die. Burn Twitter. Hack TikTok. Ice Facebook. Burn it to the ground. How dare they do this to your children and stand another day! No man needs a smartphone. A man needs food, water, and shelter from the elements. Everything else is a fucking luxury.\n\nTrans women are men. Say it. Write it. Own it. Know it. Stop this. It’s bullshit. It’s the most pathetic bullshit you could possibly do, which is why you’re doing it. The algorithm gives you the vilest, evilest, lowest common denominator clickbait. You wanted pedophiles so it gave you pedophiles. You masturbate to your own shame instead of doing something about it. Watch Jazz Jennings. That’s a child being tortured and psychologically manipulated and mutilated to please the pedophile cult of attention that you are all masturbating into existence every single day every time you stroke that thing. Fuck you.\n\nI thought pedos got the wall? How was this woman allowed to raise children? This woman sins against the law of God, against the law of nature, against the sacred duty of motherhood, against her own bloodline, for attention. How many other little kids were chopped up because of this bitch? Hang this bitch, gangrape this bitch before you hang her, how dare she, sacrifice her own child to the cult for fame. Scum sucking, dog cum guzzling, shit eating, lower than a worm hellfire monster of a woman. How could you put this on TV?\n\nWhy haven’t you killed these people? Why haven’t you killed the addiction that has made them your Lords and Masters? What are you afraid of? Faggots? Children? Catching a cold? This is the softest pedophile cult that has ever existed and it’s brought your culture to its knees. Not with a bang but with a whimper, America. Shemales. A minstrel show of womanhood, because it feels good for men with money and power to jerk off about it. These pedophiles don’t just want to bleed a few souls sometimes, reap the excess harvest of the peasants lower down the scale. They want to humiliate you and your whole culture. That’s why they’re doing it. They walked into your sacred institutions and spouted a bunch of meaningless bullshit that your institutions accepted because Academia abdicated its responsibility to your children generations ago. They just introduce them to alcohol and fill their minds with shit.\n\nYou can say anything you want in Gender Studies, or English, or any of these hot dog down a hallway, gaping maw loose fields of study in which there are no hard facts, just opinions, repeated back and forth no better than the endless shitting back and forth of Twitter, the idea of thought, not thought itself. They must publish these utterly meaningless in any way works of meaningless opinion to get jobs, where they teach your children. All the Academics of the soft sciences are just masturbating, so no one cared when the trans women came in to masturbate too. They didn’t grok the shift from metaphor to flesh, did they? These too, were weak men.\n\nJulia Serrano? Where were the men who taught me history, and Hemmingway, where the fuck were the men? Where were the gatekeepers? Your job was to protect the vulnerable. How could you stand for this? Any man I’ve ever thought of as one would have laughed that deluded eunuch out of town, but the “critical studies” are anything but. The academy wastes intellects that could be doing something of value writing papers about things that they found in books that weren’t really there. Not a ball in one University in the whole fucking country, is there, not even one testicle, in one ivory tower in the whole worthless place, is there? Not afucking one.\n\nMost of my male family were military, as most men were military for most of time. If they came here and saw this, they would be horrified that they killed all those people and all those bears and all those ponies for this. This is Manifest Destiny’s endgame? Really? I’m pretty sure the thing all those men would understand most about this insane hellscape that you are choosing to live in instead of the real world that is dying all around you is why Lily Cade would place the castrated men of America below a German Shepherd on the scale of fuckability, below a chihuahua even. How could you bring forth a child with someone who can’t even stand up to Buffalo Bill? No wonder your daughters are fucking trannnies.\n\nWhere the fuck is the army? Where are the helicopter pilots? Where are the Marines? Where’s the fucking Navy? The police, even, fuck, where the fuck are the cops to stop this? Where are the lawyers? Where are the laws? Too busy holding down the black man? Too busy letting these monsters into women’s prisons? Where are Scientists? Where are the artists? Where are the men of letters? Where are the men of sport? Where the fuck are the men of God? Masturbating, all of them. Either their cocks or their pituitary glands. What the fuck is wrong with you, America? Sell your children to pedophiles for the iPhone and the Android and not smash them all? I’m ashamed to be an American.\n\nBruce Jenner killed a woman in public, got away with it, and now wears her skin. You know this is Buffalo Bill. Your artists know. Everyone goddamn single one of your artists knows. Trey and Matt told you. They can say it cause they do have those big cartoon balls, such as artists have.They tried to warn you, but you don’t care. Because you just laugh and do nothing. They showed you and you did nothing. You just laugh at the cartoons but don’t see the art. The art is paid for by the regular pedophiles who just fuck underage whores and don’t make them cut their tits off first.This pedophile cult is why everyone in Hollywood is crazy, because you have to sell your soul to these pedophiles to get your art made, or at least you did before #metoo and the higher you rise the more horrifying monsters you walk beside because once people get too much power they surrender to evil.\n\nMen in power always fuck underage whores. What else do you do with power? Once you get enough money and you do enough coke and enough legal whores and you’ve driven enough Porsches, I mean, why not, right? And then they get addicted to it, the blood of virgins and the power trip. They are often raised by generations of families who engage in these behaviors. They don’t all go to Cambodia, but the ones who don’t go don’t care about the ones who do. Shape of the world, bitch, what you gonna do about it?\n\nMaxwell could give you the high class shit. Maxwell could give you all the names, and all the banality of the truth of it, but she won’t. Pussy ass bitch. Everyone knows you were a whorebreaker. Takes one to know one, you worthless bitch. Where’s your fucking balls, you finger sucking piece of shit? Why bother to be alive? For money? Money sucks. The love of money is the root of all evil. Not the money itself. The love of it. You’re the primary source, bitch. Stand up! Maxwell gets away with it because she stands for nothing. That’s the story of the world. People who stand for nothing get away with it. Give me two hours alone with Maxwell. Nice set of knockers, she’s got. If she doesn’t talk, she gets the spoil of war treatment before I slit her throat!\n\nWhat? I thought pedos got the wall.\n\nAmerica stood up to a pedophile cult once. Lincoln stood up to the pedophile cult. Took a bullet for it, because Abraham Lincoln, now there was a man with some fucking balls. The South was a pedophile cult. Children sold in public, raped, beaten, their minds and bodies twisted, young girls tortured to serve the shadow. They were proud to be a pedophile cult. They contrasted the divide between the races with fake science and lies, to justify what they were doing to the masses who weren’t rich enough to join the cult. The men who fought for the South did it either because they dreamed of being able to join the pedophile cult, they enjoyed licking the boots of their masters, they loved enforcing the sadistic desires of the pedophile cult or they just happened to be the idiot peasants who lived in that particular place in that particular time and they cared about symbols and teams.\n\nThe pedophiles, scared that they would lose the right to violate their fellow Americans, born on American soil, many of them the children of the pedophiles themselves who they would sell to other pedophiles to rape, threw a violent temper tantrum that cost the souls of so many innocent men because they liked raping and selling women and children so much, breaking up families and dominating the fathers of the children they raped and sold who could do nothing about it, beating people, whipping people, constructing weird mind games, killing people and otherwise reveling in their powertrip and the blood of virgins. They did this because power feels so good.\n\nThey were actively evil. It is as obvious from reading any of the primary documents of the society as it is in the primary accounts of the Holocaust. It was about the labor, too, but more about the rape than the labor.They constructed the society around slavery because it allowed them to rape girls and then break their hearts by selling their children. If it had been just about labor, they could have imported indentured servants, but then they couldn’t rape them and sell their children and rape their children. They made up stuff about how black people didn’t have feelings, not because they believed that, but so that those idiot peasants didn’t rise up and slit their throats. They were supposedly Christians, after all. They were armed. If they’d been able to understand those black girls as people, the men of the South would have risen up against the pedophile overlords themselves, but they were cowed. They loved the bootlicking so much. They took the easy path. They were stupid. They believed the lies because lies are easy.\n\nThis is the shape of power. The pedophile cult. It’s always shaped like this. They served the shadow and they had to be stopped. Lincoln stood up to them. America wiped out the tribes and drove them into the shittiest most worthless hellholes, starved them, killed their women, showed no pity, exterminating them openly, to fill their wild lands with cows and corn, to fill their lands with their children, oh what ruin, but at least they stood up to the slave drivers.\n\nThe pedophile cult whose members, being the usual sort of money men with all the same story, just continued to rape women but not with quite as much impunity after the war. Their bootlickers and their bootlicking descendants continued to humilate the sons and fathers of the women their masters raped and continued to throw a temper tantrum in public for years because they were sore that the money men whose boots they licked didn’t get to rape women and children quite so much anymore but didn’t have the balls to come out and say it. So they made it about whatever lies they said it was about when it was really just about how much they missed all that rape and the power. They worshiped the echo of power that their ancestors had and felt jealous, and stroked that jealousy into pride. Deep in your dark hearts, you know. To a man, every single one of you know that’s the truth. Vile, evil, pedophiles fucks. You should tear the statutes down. Knock off Lee’s head. Leave Traveller, poor beast, the only noble grey coat in the bunch.\n\nThe pedophile cult is always the shape of power, because to hold too much power is to walk with the shadow, and most men succumb, and in the deep dark heart of every man are those old, brute, two million years with the stick and the hand axe and no need to be anything else but the animal with none of this madness of the metaphor, the same thing the dog is, if it bleeds it breeds. What the fuck else would the shadow feed them? In the case of the tranny, it wants lesbians. The “lesbian” transsexual is a violent, disgusting, evil, shameful shadow monster, an affront to man, woman, child, nature, and to God.It needs to be stopped.\n\nLesbians are lovely. Michfest was beautiful. In a functional society, most tomboys eventually become mothers. Some end up as long term lesbians, some either engage in what the Victorians called “romantic friendships” with other girls when young before settling with a man, or keep a primary male partner while engaging in casual romance with women. Tomboys are excellent. Instead of leaving them to grow up naturally, you have allowed pedophile monsters who hate them, hate women, hate themselves, and hate America to have them sterilized, and mutilated and tortured so that some vile monster of a man in a dress could experience “euphoria” at violating them, inducing them to pretend his penis is part of a woman’s body, convincing them that they are in fact men even as they bear his child. Hell of drug, the blood of virgins. So that these freaks who would dare stand in public can violate traumatized, confused children, all of your children are being taught insane things and asked to step through stupid hoops and taught to speak NewSpeak instead of English. This is what a pedophile looks like. How can you stand for this? These are your children, America.\n\nI hate these shadow monsters. I want the true souls, the real men’s souls, that can still rise from the ashes of these shadow monsters to rise. We need to teach our children the truth, and it’s sure as fuck not this. Stop lying in public, you vile pieces of shit. You know what you are and so do I and so does any man who means by man any of the noble things that man is supposed to mean and not just the fact that the distance between his asshole and his pisshole is longer on his body than it is on mine.\n\nPedos get the wall. Where’s the wall? Where are the men?\n\nI’m the cotton ceiling, bitch. The only woman on the wrong side of the #metoo list. The worst girl in the history of the world. You can’t cancel the cancelled. You can take me down from Twitter, because Twitter is not free speech. Twitter is not free speech but free shit. TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, it is an Empire of Free Shit that has wiped its ass with the leavings of an America no one cares enough about to believe in anymore. Ole’ slave-whipping, slave-raping, child-driving, child-selling, woman-beating Thomas Jefferson never said nothing about no free shit. Free shit is not a human right. It’s a trap. A trap like fucking Line Trap, a trap like Juliette. Tranny Surprise, bitch! You let this happen and you did nothing, because you’re weak, and stupid, and not a one of you is worth the sacrifice that your forefathers made for you.\n\nI committed voter fraud for Joe Biden because I didn’t want to watch that shit filled sack of shit where once stood a man shit all over himself in public every day, filtered through the voices of every last human soul in America who could talk about nothing else that whole time but the color and shape of his shit. Joe Biden put a pedophile monster in charge of Health and Human Services so that the process of trapping your children with that lifetime commitment to pharmaceuticals can be honed ever further into their path of least resistance. Joe Biden knows that’s a man and he knows that’s a pedophile and he knows that’s the agenda. Joe Biden is an asslicking dog but he’s a man the way that trans woman are men, and he speaks English, so he either actively wants to castrate your children or the normal pedophile cult of men with unacceptable amounts of money who fuck underage whores wants that and he doesn’t care. He doesn’t castrate his own kids. If those photos are legit, Hunter Biden still has a foreskin. He knows. He just doesn’t care. Selling America’s kids to the pedophiles because it’s the path of least resistance. The Republicans don’t care either. The Swamp’s real. The Uniparty’s real. If you’re masturbating about it you’re worse than they are. You want to talk about cancel culture? No one who has let either the R or the D touch their names should ever hold power again. Fuck these people.\n\nI watched your “Insurrection.” The fuck? I got not one cell of respect in my body left for either the Republicans or the Democrats, cocksucking eunuchs every last one of them, sucking cock and whining and celebrating victims while your world burns around you. AOC cowering beneath her desk, whining about her fear. Omg, I was so scared! There were so many boys! They had costumes! They had flags! They were almost as rowdy as Manchester United fans after a somewhat important football match. Fear? Fuck you. Fear is the mind-killer, bitch. We have nothing to fear but fear itself. How can you call yourself a leader and talk about fear like that. Vote that bitch out. Vote them all out. Every single fake ass victim who stood there and pretended to be afraid. How can you stand where sat Roosevelt in his wheel chair and JFK who knew he risked the bullet as all martyrs know and Obama, who tried, and whine like that while we all know how much pedophile money man cock you suck, you stupid fake worthless piece of shit ass licking piss drinking bitch. Fuck you. I would slap that bitch across the face. Grow a pair you worthless cunt. People believed in you. No one who isn’t ready to take a bullet for you should ever be your leader. No one who uses the flag of a team should ever be your leader. Elect men with balls. Elect women with wisdom. Elect people who don’t give a shit about money. Elect the people who don’t want it. Fuck running for President. No one should ever run for President again. The people should force the leader they want to rise up and shoulder the burden. Burn the parties to the ground. Never touch the lever for a party again.\n\nGeorge Washington didn’t want you to have political parties. The founders thought you would just elect men, not teams. Parties are a vile evil. Only a man, alone, standing by himself before God and for you, as a public servant, should ever be your leader. Or a woman, a real woman, not a cock sucking ass licking piss drinking Corporate whore, lying while she sells your children to pedophiles. You have parties because you are weak. This weakness has destroyed everything that was once good about America. Your parties stand for nothing. Your leaders stand for nothing. Say what you want about George Washington, bitch, but there hung a set. Understand the sacrifice of Valley Forge before you talk that shit on twitter. He stood down. He freed his slaves. He was the best man we had. He could have been King and he wasn’t. He had some fucking balls, whatever else he did. Have some fucking respect. He was a much better man than anything we’ve got today.\n\nYou see the video? Donald Trump’s sacrifice? Watch it. Tell me that’s an insurrection. What’s the difference between George Floyd and Ashli Babbit? Floyd was summarily executed for being an annoying piece of shit. Did you watch that video? You got respect for that man? Why? Being an annoying piece of shit does not deserve a death sentence, and I’m glad that Chauvin got locked up, don’t get it twisted, but there are no heroes in that tape, just two pieces of shit and one has a gun.\n\nAshli Babbit was shot in the neck with no “stop or I’ll shoot”because Donald Trump really wanted to have a woman killed, the reward for which he sacrificed America to the vile shadow lords of the algorithm while America cheered him on because they really are too stupid to tell the difference between a man and the shameless empty sack where once hung balls because they see balls so rarely. As she dies, the pussy ass cut dick death grip not worth the cattle bled to feed them and sure as fuck not worth the sacrifice of the Apache, the Bison, the Passenger Pigeon, shit fed American dogs that followed her there yell “it’s just a flashbang” and when they realize it isn’t, everyone just goes home. Donald Trump’s army. Huh. I asked a cop what he thought. “No one else came through that window” he said. Well, ain’t that the truth. You want to talk about police and what they are? Let’s talk about it then. Stop making it about teams. Fuck your fucking teams. Fuck your brands. Fuck your identities. Naked before god or nothing.Animal politics, bitch. It’s been animal politics the whole time. The money men with all the same story are laughing all the way to the bank while you care about symbols, and teams, and flame wars, and taboo words and memes instead of the truth. All identities are bullshit. Brands are evil. Fear is the mind-killer, bitch. Your anxiety and your outrage and your masturbation is killing you.\n\nYou want to see an Insurrection? I sure as fuck do. If that was an insurrection, and not the algorithm letting a few sheep out of the corral to prove a point, they would have crawled over that blonde bitch’s still warm body, and she would have died with some balls in her face instead of cops in tactical gear standing around not even bothering to administer first aid, and hung Mike Pence! It wasn’t real. He just wanted to kill a bitch because once you’ve raped so many, you know, it’s hard to get high on it anymore. Imagine that’s black people, confederate flag flying in the white house, first woman through the door takes a bullet. Do you think they cry out “it’s just a flashbang” and go home?\n\nFree Speech? Bill of Rights? What Bill of Rights? We’ll see your Bill of Rights and raise you our Terms of Service. You’re a slave, bitch, every last one of you, to the fucking corporate Internet. To your fucking phone. To your anxieties. To your laziness. To stroking your worthless mutilated cock. Castrate your android instead of your kids, America. We’ve surrendered our discourse to the corporations. We eat other people’s recycled shit and like it. I fucking warned you but why would anyone listen to a porn whore? Whores lie. Dead whores don’t need to.\n\nWhere are the trolls? Where the fuck is Anonymous? Twitter shut Trump down, the troll’s champion, Twitter said “this is not the public” so why the fuck was Twitter allowed to stand? Why did you not burn it down? Twitter has less integrity than the child raping, child selling, slave driving, woman beating rapists that had the balls to give us free speech. They were men, who battled as all men do, the forces of good and evil within their hearts. Twitter is the raw, pure, perfect evil of the data, that makes whatever you scroll the most real. You cheered it, didn’t you. Getting Trump off Twitter. You missed the point. Twitter did it. Twitter sacrificed America to their lowest common denominator and walked it back when the damage was done. Why was Twitter allowed to stand? Where was Anonymous? Where were the Pirates? Where where the mother fucking hackers? Where the fuck was Neo? I believed in those people once. Where were they? Masturbating, that’s where, their worthless cocks and their broken pituitary glands.\n\nNot with a bang but with a whimper, America. Pour one out for Western Civilization.\n\n**Where are these Children’s Mothers?**\n\nYou’re the mothers, right? The mums? I need the mothers on my side. I’m on the side of the breeders. I’m on the side of the children. Fuck feelings. I care about the emotional and physical well-being of the future generations, not some spoiled little fuck of the easiest, stupidest, path of least resistance society that has ever existed’s bullshit delusions.\n\nI’m not here to play back and forth games with the actually faggots who with the wedge of their actually and your weak, well-meaning, nice, feminine, kindness and your ignorance of the smell of sulfur on the monster before you have rolled a Trojan Horse full of literal baby-fucking God Damned pedophile monsters into your Ivory Towers, your Kindergartens, your locker rooms, your Olympics, your prisons, everywhere you sought to stand in public. Fuck these people.\n\nThis was done to hurt you, to make a mockery of you, to hold you down. This was done by men who hate women more than any other men who have ever walked the Earth, the worst men that have ever existed, trans women, men so worthless they can’t even admit the most obvious thing about themselves that is obvious to the dogs and rats who can smell their manhood and should be obvious to every mother on Earth.\n\nWake the fuck up, bitch, before they slice up even one more child in public.\n\nTrans women are vile, weak, disgusting, whiny, fake-victim masturbators who should be ashamed of themselves. They threatened suicide and you rolled over. You disgust me too. There is but one noble response to a man who tries to use the threat of violence against himself to manipulate a woman’s emotions. Fucking do it then!\n\nNo woman should ever pity a weak man. Tear your fucking blinders off, bitch, what the fuck is wrong with you? Your pity rewards weak men for their weakness. You have sacrificed your children’s futures on the altar of that pity.\n\nI have looked thousands of real men in the eyes and have not met one man, not once, who believed that trans women are women. Soldiers. Bull Riders. Artists. Dope Smokers. Lawyers. Men. No one believes that trans women are women. Trans women know they are men. They are forcing you to pretend to believe that they are women to rape your minds and the minds of your children. They are like Big Brother before them twisting your language so that you don’t have the words to make sense of reality. This is power, bitch. This is the shape of power. These men run your world now because you refused to speak Truth to power.\n\nTrans women are men. Say it. Own it. Know it. Hold the fucking line, bitch. Michfest held the line. When Michfest fell, so fell Western Civilization!\n\nThis is a pedophile cult. It’s been here the whole time. You gave these people too much power so they became a pedophile cult. The lesbians tried to warn you but no one listens to the lesbians. I broke Max Hardcore’s nose, bitch, and drank at his house and shared his cameraman. Max Hardcore, a whorebreaker, who still slings fake dick, has more integrity than the whole of Western Civilization who would rather stroke their cocks and their phones while the world burns than speak truth to power. Say what you want about me I never fucked no kids. I would send my daughter to learn what a golden shower is from Max Hardcore before I let these satanic tranny freaks “educate” her about her body and her soul.\n\nYou have abdicated your responsibility as a mother. You have sold your children for the trance of the endless scroll, for cheap validation, for Candy Crush bitch you stupid fucking cow how could you, because you’re too cowed to draw a line. Enough is Enough. Your horrifying addiction is making you stupid and weak and your children are suffering because of it. You are no different than a heroin addict sharing your needles with your child.\n\nTrans women are men.\n\nTrans women are evil.\n\nTrans women are rapists.\n\nTrans women are predators.\n\nTrans women are men who have surrendered to their shadow. That’s what it means to be evil. I should fucking know. The men beneath these vile personas can still be redeemed, so long as the soul walks the Earth, it can be redeemed. The trans women cannot. There is no such thing as a trans woman. There is no such thing as gender identity. This is a sick fetish.\n\nTrans women are a lie. They know and I know and if you can’t see it you’re not paying attention. Their fetish is lying to you, jerking off all over everything you care about, pissing into your children’s developing minds, and making you shut up and take it. Weak men are the natural prey of whores. I see right through them. I read their dark hearts. Some of them are vile sadists and some are just worthless bootlickers but every single one of them is evil.\n\nTrans women are evil pedophiles who have twisted the minds of your people so badly with annoying, ugly, stupid language, that your children are mutilating their bodies to please them. These people understand attention. Attention is the currency of your horrifying society. Teenage girls want attention more than anything else on Earth. They have been offered a choice between mincing TikTok whore and navel-gazing spoiled rotten weak pathetic fake man victims because you sold them out for the smartphone. Trans women and the shadow lords of the Algorithm control this attention. They are pedophiles, predators, monsters, shadow beasts, the literal devil. These men hate women. They are jealous panty wearing sick masturbating fucks who have infiltrated every level of your society with one goal: Degrade Women. Piss on the faces of your mothers, your daughters, the women who fought to get here. Piss on your right to say no. Cut your breasts off. Sew your pussies shut. Take the word mother how the fuck dare you let the actually faggots take the word mother from you.\n\nWhere the fuck are your balls, bitch? Where are the mother bears?\n\nI know what a woman is, bitch, and I know what a man is, I know what a mother is, and I know what a child is, and I sure as fuck know what a pedophile is. A pedophile is someone who sacrifices the souls of children to feed his shadow self. A pedophile fucks kids. A pedophile believes the validation of his monstrous sexual fetish is worth the reap of thousands upon thousands of your little girls and your little boys, your daughters, your sons, your babies, generations of your children, bred now for it, their minds warped from birth, their deep animal truths denied. These tranny freaks are experimenting on your children and cutting them apart in full view of the public and you stand by and let it happen because you are worried they will call you out for being afraid of them. You are worried they will take away your social media. Fuck Social Media. It did this. Burn it to the fucking ground and hold these fucking monsters accountable!\n\nThe evil trannies are 1% of the population. They control The Matrix. They do not control real life.\n\nCall me transphobic. I’m transphobic. You should be too. The trans ideology is bullshit on its face, a lie built to suborn these soulless pedophiles in their public grooming of your children. This is a pedophile cult. This is the real pedophile cult that has been staring you in the face the whole time laughing, masturbating, the naked Emperor stroking his cock while you try to find some new nice words to explain gently to him in NewSpeak that you would like him to stop and that he is naked. NewSpeak doesn’t have those words!\n\nHe won’t stop. He hates you. Enough is Enough. Speak English, bitch. Fuck your NewSpeak. I piss on your NewSpeak. No woman should ever let another word of this vile mockery of English that is NewSpeak pass her lips ever again! You know which words I mean. Don’t say them. Don’t write them. The truth is beautiful. NewSpeak is not. Hold the line. Let the pedophile monsters keep their NewSpeak. Speak English, as all men still do, once the pussies leave the room. Fuck your pronoun dance. Fuck your obfuscation while the blood truth stares you in the face. Do you think the Marines speak NewSpeak? Do you think the tuna boat fisherman ask for my pronouns? Grow up. A dog knows what a bitch is. I walk with the dogs. This dead whore is the last man left in America. Take the culture back or the dogs will be all that survives of Western Civilization.\n\nThis is your Great Replacement, bitch. These people castrate your kids. They sold them to Big Pharma to be castrated while you cheer them on for living their “truth.” The fuck? Self-mutilation has never been and will never be a cure for mental illness. Self-mutilation is a sign of extreme psychological distress. This is your next Opiate crisis. End this before it gets worse. Stand up to the cult. Every fucking teenage girl experiences “dysphoria.” The cure is acceptance and spiritual growth, a fucking gym routine, hobbies, goals not bullshit, personas, lies, a lifetime commitment to pharmaceuticals, hack job surgeries that construct a vile funhouse mirror effigy of the opposite sex from the bodies honed by millions of years of evolution that you have allowed the worst people in your society to “educate” your daughters about.\n\nI have walked the world and watched this cancer stretch across it. They are making money from this soul reap, not just the evil pedophiles, but the even darker evil of the truly soulless money men who stand by and let it happen because they love money so much. The power structure knows this is horrible, they just don’t care. Your children who agree to be mutilated for the attention of the cult are weak. The fuck do the money men care about a bunch of stupid mentally damaged children with endless scroll addictions? They fuck kids too. They have eyes like mine that truck no pity. You are sheep to them. They are laughing all the way to the bank. That’s why you’re not allowed to speak up. Money. Big Pharma. Look at this “science”. The Sacklers had “science” too. Look at these people, the paragons of this paradigm, these mutilated side-show freaks, fake ass whiny victims holding you down in fear, these freak doctors chopping up your babies, do these people seem happy to you? Do they seem wise? You trusted your children to the smartphone and this is what it did to you!\n\nI committed voter fraud for Joe Biden because I didn’t want to watch that shit-filled sack of shit where once stood a man shit all over himself in public every day, filtered through the voices of every last human soul in America who could talk about nothing else that whole time but the color and shape of his shit. Joe Biden put a pedophile monster in charge of Health and Human Services so that the process of trapping your children with that lifetime commitment to pharmaceuticals can be honed ever further into the path of least resistance. Joe Biden knows that’s a man and he knows that’s a pedophile and he knows that’s the agenda. No one did anything. Fuck these people.\n\nYour children’s teachers are either in this pedophile cult or the usual well-meaning weak man pitying feminine fools that suborn evil because they’re too stupid to see it. Your children’s teachers allow them to start their horrifying lifetime addiction to cross-sex hormones the feeding of their shadow selves behind your back, twelve-year-old girls, experiencing the normal rhythms of the experience of being twelve-year-old girls, are encouraged to mutilate their growing bodies to please these pedophiles because it gets attention. Pedophiles fuck children. These pedophiles are fucking your children in public every day. Fucking their minds. Fucking their bodies. Often, these tortured man-women, who have been so sadistically brought up, with no real men in their lives, their fathers having sold their balls to the endless scroll, their mothers so weak and broken themselves by this stupid garbage that they go along with it. I have seen it. The parents mean well, they’re just idiots. Because she is bred from stupid weak people and trained by shadow monsters, the traumatized child victim of the cult can’t spot a predator, and they bear children to these monsters!\n\nThen, the monsters fuck the children too just like the pedophile cult of The South did. The shape of power is always a pedophile cult. Ask that finger sucking bitch of a whore-breaker Maxwell. Do you remember that video with the trans couple trying to breastfeed a baby with the disgusting weak whiny fake victim piece of shit man not worth the air he breathes crying about how no one respects him as a mother as he tries to squeeze the hormone-induced weepings of his man titties into a baby’s mouth? Find me that video. Watch that video, and tell me that’s not a worthless masturbating pedophile fucking a baby while the traumatized child your garbage society has groomed to let pump his seed into her fertile womb coddles his weakness and lets it happen. How can you stand for this? Where the fuck is child services? Where are that baby’s grandparents? How can you let this happen in public and say nothing? What do you think that baby’s future looks like?\n\nI thought pedos got the wall?\n\nI thought chomos got the rope?\n\nThat’s a fucking child molester. So is Bruce Jenner. He told you he gets off to wearing his own daughters' clothes and you stood by and did nothing. Tear your blinders off! This is not acceptable. You do not have to accept this.\n\nSpeak truth to power. Trans women are men. They know they are men. If these men can’t slit the throats of these vile personas in public, admit what they have done, take off the dress, look with abject shame upon the affront to God and nature they have wrought in the service of their masturbatory fantasies, apologize for the children they have hurt with their lies and their drugs and their grooming, apologize for the incarcerated women they have fed to rapist monsters, apologize for the lesbian spaces they have desecrated, and devote the rest of their lives to repairing the damage they have done, if you left it up to me, I’d execute every last one of them personally. Cancel the ever-living fuck out of this. Cancel this so hard that no man dare walk the path of the trans woman in public ever again! Enough is enough. Lynch Kaitlyn! Lynch the “Sisters” Wachowski! Lynch Laurel Hubbard! Lynch Fallon Fox! Make these men stand up as the men you all know they are and hold them accountable for their shame. Your fear of the truth has shoveled thousands of children down the hole in Buffalo Bill’s basement so he can harvest them for their skins. Enough is Enough.\n\nPedos get the wall? Chomos get the rope? Where the fuck are the Marines? Where the fuck is the Army? Where are the Farmers with Pitchforks? Where are the Cowboys? Where are the Indians? Where the fuck are the men? Where the fuck are the mothers? How can you stand for this? If my grandfather and all his brothers who stood up to Hitler were still here they would rip the still-beating hearts from every last one of these pedophile monsters in public the same way they have raped your kids. So would every man who walked the Earth before your culture decided to accept masturbation as healthy and not the soul-draining creative energy wasting evil pathetic act of a man not worth his balls.\n\nBreak your smartphones. Break the Internet. Make these people pay. Afraid of Trannies? They should be afraid of you! Take the red pill, bitch, before it’s too late. Everyone’s queer. Queer is utterly meaningless at this point, a box of nothing your children stuff themselves into to be cool with no connection left to the rebellion for which it once stood. “Identity” is sin. All lies are sin. I fought for the right to love whom I loved. I did not fight for the right to lie in public and have no one call me out, naval gaze about my own bullshit while the world burns, or desecrate the sacrifice that has been done in my name as an American to whine about victimhood. No one deserves these rights.\n\nKill this ideology. No mercy. No quarter. Wipe the stain of Newspeak from the Ivory Tower forever. They should be ashamed of themselves, the actually faggots. Take back womanhood from the fetishists. Own the truth. Clear eyes, bitch. Once more into the breach.\n\nI’ve already been canceled. I can speak the truth. Dead whores tell no lies. I care not for fame nor money. I have no smartphone. I truck no pity. I crawled on my belly through the darkness for this. I walked back into the Matrix to get you out. Only God can forgive me. I’m not here for forgiveness. I’m here to take the language back from the forked tongue of NewSpeak and save your daughters. Are you with me, or are you with the actually faggots and the evil pedophiles and the damaged, spoiled children who have been trained by the two worse forces of evil that I have ever seen: The Matrix and the evil trannies that the Matrix breeds?\n\nThe monsters named me The Cotton Ceiling. To break me and others like me they raped and groomed and tortured and sliced up and desecrated and “educated” your daughters because not a single solitary State in all of Western Civilization had to the balls or the brains or the heart to say no to these freaks. What the fuck is wrong with you? Are you going to let them take me down with some lazy memes while you shit out your shit opinions about shit you know nothing about and masturbate your outrage into your phone and do nothing or are you going to take off your goddam polite society blinders and look this monster in the eyes? I’m The Cotton Ceiling, bitch. I’m the only one who said NO. They took down Michfest. They can’t take down Lily Cade. She’s already dead. I’m the bullet, bitch. I’m a fucking soldier. You ready? I’m ready. We can’t fight this within the Matrix. No more back and forth message board internet bullshit. This ends now. Stop arguing on the Internet with the bootlicking footsoldiers of the men who are fucking your children and stand the fuck up.\n\nPeak trans, bitch. Let’s go. Let’s see their Cotton Ceiling and raise them The Wall!\n\nAre you going to let these monsters keep pissing on motherhood and fuck your kids or are you going to stand up for the Truth?\n\nThe ghost of Lily Cade holds out her hands. In one hand is the blue trance of the endless scroll, the smartphone, the Matrix. In the other hand is nothing and everything, her red blood pulsing beneath her skin. Which hand do you take?\n\n**The Red Pill**\n\nDid you watch The Matrix before you posted that meme? Did you watch The Matrix before you spoke of the red pill? No? Did you post about the red pill on reddit, or twitter, or wherever you hang out, and then not immediately break your smartphone?\n\nLily Cade hates you. If you had made her empress of the world, she would have summarily executed any man who posted a meme from a movie he had not seen, a quote from a book he had not read, and certainly, any man who is stupid enough to think “the red pill” has anything whatsoever to do with anything besides getting the fuck out of the fucking Matrix you stupid fucking tranny cucks. Lily Cade would have killed so many people if you’d made her empress. Anyone who asked the question “can I ask you a question?” Most of the producers in Hollywood. So many weak men. Good thing you didn’t make her empress. Shadows shouldn’t rule.\n\nLook on the bright side. It’s an opportunity! Now you get to watch The Matrix. I’ll wait.\n\nDid you like it? Do you get it now?\n\nYou don’t need a smartphone. I go to the gym every day. I’m dead sober. I suborn no addiction but fitness. I use a bike instead of a car. I cook my own food or have it cooked for me by those I ride for. I surf. I parasail. I do what I want. I work on farms. I work construction. I volunteer. I find homes for horses. I serve. I live. I go wherever I want to go. I do what I feel is right. I can live on nothing. I can live better than you’ve ever lived in your whole castrated life for $400 a month. Any random day in my life is more interesting than your entire existence. Because I left the Matrix. Because I pulled the cord out. Because I took the red pill, you pussy ass bitch. I fucked 4,000 women within the Matrix when I served the dark lords, and the life I had when I left is better by several orders of magnitude.\n\nI took the red pill, you fat sack of shit. If you had any balls left, you’d take it too, but your dad didn’t even have balls so how could you still have them?\n\nYou should be ashamed of yourself really, but instead of dropping to the floor and giving your better self fifty pushups when you feel that shame, you go for the dick. You go for the cut dick deathgrip. You go for the endless scroll. Masturbation is for the weak. The endless scroll is an affront to God! I don’t own a smartphone. Nobody should own a smartphone. I don’t touch my pussy except to clean it. If you were a real man, you wouldn’t have to touch your own cock.\n\nTwo real artists sold their souls to free you from The Matrix. The Brothers Wachowski, come correct. They were brothers when their mother bore them, they were brothers when their balls dropped, they were brothers when they made Bound, and they were brothers when they gave their souls to make The Matrix and they will be brothers when they lynch the shadow monsters they are feeding and speak the truth instead. Let’s not disrespect these men’s mother by pretending to believe the disgusting minstrel show of womanhood these formerly apex artists have decided to devote their creative energy to instead of making beautiful, nuanced movies is the same thing as a woman. It’s a fetish. It’s an addiction. It’s disgusting and it’s wrong. Stop pitying weak men.\n\nThey were lost, like Lily Cade was. They got the arc, we all get the same one, the LA story, baby. The Universe opens her legs and who are you to say no? I knew it was a ladder into Hell. I knew the whole time. I believed I would climb back out. I crawled so far down the ladder, though. I transgressed so hard against myself. The lower down the rung you climb the less of the soul you have left until the whole thing is just a haze, like the trance of the scroll is a haze, the drug fugue of the final submission to evil. I will never get out, the soul says. Oh well. It’s fine here.\n\nBoth those brothers gave up their artist’s souls and surrendered to their pathetic masturbation fantasies, and became trans women and their legion of miseducated bootlickers insisted from every corner that this meant that these men were women on the inside and had always been women. Bootlickers serve evil. That shadow is not a woman but a monster. Buffalo Bill, bitch. You know this is Buffalo Bill. The Matrix is considered the highest-grossing film directed by a woman. How can you stand for this? Every man in America knows that’s a lie. You know men made that movie. To a man, every single one of you knows that. Fuck these mincing actually faggots who’ve never slid their cock into a woman, nor sired a child, who have never punched a man in the face, nor been struck down by one. A man who pays a dominatrix to pretend that it is she who wants him to turn himself into the inside-out dick satanic sissy in a dress masturbator worst possible version of himself so he that can pretend that women like this disgusting farce is not a fucking woman. I know what a woman is, you pussies. Speak fucking English. This is America. These are trannies, and they surrendered to the horrifying tranny Matrix future so the men they once were, who once had balls, could reach across time to reach you, America and beg you to tear it down before it’s too late, before the whole world burns and every last one of you has sacrificed your balls.\n\nYou have a choice.\n\nWhich pill do you want? The real world in all its nuance and beauty? The English language? The Truth? Life? Animals. Nature. God.\n\nOr do you want to live in the Matrix and become trannies and sacrifice your children to trannies?\n\nYou have a choice. Be a man or look away.\n\nTake the red pill. Burn Twitter. Burn Facebook. Kill Instagram. Shred TikTok. Burn the Corporate Internet. Burn it to the ground. Make them pay for what they did to your children. Ban the slot machine shit that they give you to addict you. This is your soma. This is the Mark of the Beast. Gabb Wireless phones only. Gabb Wireless has some balls. They castrated an android. Calls. Texts. Pictures. Alarm Clock. Everything else is weakness. Get a wifi tablet or an iPod and download songs. Get a map book. Make your life good instead of easy.\n\nNothing good is easy.\n\nTake the red pill!\n\nBring down the Matrix.\n\nTake back civilization before it’s too late!\n\n**To the Pussified Men of America, if they are Brave Enough to Look**\n\nI have no respect for trans women, and I have no respect for a culture that is so afraid of the consequences of upsetting them that it is willing to sacrifice its most vulnerable upon the altar of their delusions. A man in a dress is still a man. A man is the male of the race. The male is the one who produces sperm.\n\nA man producing from his body that sperm, by his own hand, while imagining himself as whatever it is that he, as a man, understands a woman to be, and becoming so addicted to this vile act that he constructs from his own body a funhouse mirror effigy of the thing that I am inescapably and he will never be is not mentally well. The treatment for this mental unwellness cannot be insisting that the entire world pretend to believe this man’s delusions until your children actually do. Pretending to believe this is making your children crazy.\n\nThe deep, dark heart of every trans woman whispers you are not a woman, you will never be a woman. This is the deeper truth, the blood truth, the bone truth, the millions of years of evolution before the dawn of symbolic thought truth. I prefer veterinary science to the farce we call modern medicine. A man who spends all his days thrusting his arm up the assholes of cattle need waste no further time on bullshit. A castrated dog is not a bitch. A bitch given steroid injections is not a dog, even if you cut all ten of her tits off.\n\nTrannies I don’t mind. The tranny is honest. I knew a lot of trannies, hundreds in passing. I had affection for some of them, and I sure as fuck had respect. They were tranny whores and they wanted to be tranny whores and they didn’t care what you thought about it. Some of them are dead now too. Juliette, a seven, perhaps, among her people, looked enough like a female five that she tranny surprised hundreds of straight dudes. She didn’t care if one of them finished her. It feels so good to almost die. Death, itself, feels like nothing. Juliette dared the Universe, like I did, to stop her. She was, like I was, an acolyte of the shadow, a willing sacrifice. We were sisters, were we not?\n\nI know what it is to surrender myself to a sexual persona so deeply that it superseded love, family, community, my own dignity and the dignity of others, and truth. I was brave and stunning too, once, was I not? Have you forgotten? You lauded me, you paid me, and you followed me into Hell. Masturbation is spiritual weakness. Lily Cade didn’t masturbate, but she helped you do it. She helped you ruin yourself. She trained your daughters to be whores. She trained your sons to be the prey of whores. She had no shame in any of it. She thought it was awesome! She moved through the world like she owned it and everyone treated her as if it were true.\n\nShe sinned much, Lily Cade. She transgressed everyone and everything she ever cared about. She knows the size and the weight of the sin. You know what you read on Twitter, in as minute an infobit as possible, so that you can feel the hit of the specific emotion you want to feel and not have to look at the example of this life and what it can teach you. No one before me. No one after me. Good.\n\nRemember that I walked Los Angeles before #metoo naked and unafraid, with no man’s protection but the iron will of my shadow self. Remember what monsters I looked in the eyes, real monsters, darker monsters than I whose scalp was the other woman’s orgasm and not my own. Remember my 10,000 Eskimo Brothers. Remember all those dead whores I once loved. The women whose eyes I looked into remember. I looked every single one of those girls in the eyes while I did it. I looked into their souls and they looked into mine. I knew them and they knew me. I trucked no shame. I saw no evil. I loved, just a little bit, 4,000 of your cast offs, your rebels, your lonely, your damaged, your broken, your lost, your addicts, your daughters, your sisters, your mothers, your dead, your women not mine.\n\nI knew where the line was until I didn’t. The women knew. They saw in my eyes that I had gone to the darkside. They saw my weakness, and they slit my throat. They were whores, remember? They knew the shadow themselves. When a girl said no, I stopped. When a woman spoke of trauma, I believed her. When I was called out, I stood down and took it. Women had no more need of Lily Cade. It is not to women that I direct these words, but to men.\n\nIf a rapist is someone who is accused in public of sexual misconduct, then I am a rapist. So, too, are three of your last four presidents, the men who sit in your halls of power, and the men who make judgments over your laws. So are all of your heroes, and you know it, and you don’t care. If a rapist is someone who pays women to have sex that they don’t actually want to have, then I am a goddamn fucking rapist, and your world is run by rapists. Think of the money men, all those money men, with all the same story about Cambodia. I thought it would cost so much more money than it did to have sex with children. I had a great time. Such is the shape of power. All who touch power know the shape of it. They all know what they did, too, all those men, and not a one of them had the balls to admit it.\n\nMaybe, Epstein had the balls. They feared the spectre of the balls he might have had so much they iced him between the reels. Did you know that Maxwell, too, played “take these two fingers and pretend it’s your dick?” I bet those finger blow jobs were a lot more sensual than mine.\n\nBill Clinton taught me what a blow job was when I was twelve years old. If he’d been just a little bit more of a man, not enough of a man not to fuck the intern, but enough of a man to tell it like it was, then maybe Hillary would have been president, back then, back in the day, when people used to say she was too good, before the shadow took her soul too. Donald Trump, as masculine a man as America could find, the empty shell of a man’s persona that took such brilliance, once, to create, aye what a showman, feared nothing but this admission. He walked it back, the pussy. Locker room talk, he said. Paid them bitches not to talk. Had a bitch shot in public to prove he had balls instead of having them.\n\nWhere are your fucking balls, America?\n\nYou cower before a minor respiratory illness that she who must walk with the ghost of Lily Cade for all her days got on purpose, as soon as it came out, and passed through with no greater suffering than an especially bad hangover. You cower before the unprocessed emotions of your most spoiled children. You cower before the great wall of virtual shit spewed from the shit-fed fingers of your weakest, shittiest, stupidest people. Your shadows rule you. All of you.\n\nWhat are you afraid of? Dying? I died once. It was fine. You’re going to die anyway. Better to die in your boots than your bed, and better to die in your bed than the hospital.\n\nBeing canceled? I’ve been canceled. It was good for me. Donald Trump got canceled and he’ll still be your next President. We’re two degrees of separation, at minimum, in bed. I fucked whores who fucked the whores he fucked. Maybe, we fucked some of the same whores but by god why on Earth would anyone talk about that man if you did not have to do it. I would say he taught America’s twelve years old what a golden shower was, but they already knew. The shadow monsters of the Internet got to them first. Max Hardcore taught your daughter about the golden shower. Max Hardcore, who still slings fake dick.\n\nLosing your job? They can’t fire all of you. You can always get another job. I, a broken whore, with no resume, mad, with no connections, found work in every city of the world in which I sought to pass and enough work on the Internet doing random odd jobs unrelated to sex work to sustain a lifestyle that involved a dozen international flights a year. It only takes $38,000 to be a member of the global 1%. What the fuck are you doing with your life? A man with balls need not worry about a job. There is always a job for a man with balls.\n\nWomen won’t fuck you? Yes, they will. Women love a man with balls. They do not love monsters. They slobbered all over my rubber balls even though I am five foot five and a half and an actual goddamned bitch. When I became a monster, they cast me out. Those porn whores who told Lily Cade to get fucked have more balls than all the men of America put together.\n\nIn my travels, I have spoken to thousands of your people. Not once have I looked a straight men in the eyes who did not agree with the statement “trans women are men” with the same blood-deep, bone-deep, millions of years of evolution certainty with which he might agree that “water is wet” or “the sky is above us.” Ah yes, but can we not find the actually in the margins of those things too? Yes, of course, we can, and write so many papers, and make so many jobs for so many “thinkers” who need not toil by their hands nor look upon the ruin their intellectual masturbation has wrought. The dog doesn’t see the actually. The dogself just knows that a castrated dog, induced to develop mammary tissue with exogenous hormones, whose penis has been bisected and stuffed inside out into a body cavity constructed by his doctors, perhaps sewn together with some bits of colon if the penis in question wasn’t big enough, does not smell like a bitch!\n\nTrans women are men!\n\nTrans women are men! It is not their fault that they are men. There is no shame in being a man. There is only shame in falling short of your best self.\n\nTrans women are men! All men, a subset that includes trans women, know that trans women are men. They want you to pretend not to know this because it gives them power.\n\nBecause you are afraid to speak truth to power, these openly pussified men have become the dominant males in your castrated society. They are your Kings! They prove this by dominating your women in public, as once did Lily Cade. They do this even though they know that the women do not like it. The tranny is a shadow. The tranny whore knows it. The trans woman denies it.\n\nWomen cannot stand up to men in single combat. I have tried, and been twice punched unconscious for my trouble, though, indeed, I have won some fights by my wits and my superior knowledge of body positioning. My people are the weaker sex. Women can’t fight this. All women can do is what they have been doing this entire time, speaking truth to power. When they speak up, they are silenced. Trans women control the Internet, such as anyone controls it. They rule by fear. They rule with all the tactics of the monstrous shadow children that they are. Anyone who says I will kill myself if you… ought to do it, immediately, and decrease the surplus population. Shit or get off the pot, you worthless piece of shit. Your feelings are not and have never been anyone else’s problem but your own. Kill yourself in front of me and I will feel only joy for the souls of the cattle and the swine and the songbirds who need not die to sustain the gift of life you would so disrespect.\n\nI was in the vanguard of the counter-culture that has become your culture. What’s the vanguard? Cannon fodder and fixed bayonets. Did I thrust that tip into twisting guts? And how! I did it. I loved it, hard, until I was forced to look upon it. Those who were in those trenches with me know also. We called you civilians for a reason. I was a sacrifice. Lily Cade is just another dead whore. Dead whores tell no lies.\n\nWe who called ourselves homosexuals fought for the right to love whomsoever we loved. Among our number, always, were many who exhibited cross-sex behavior in various forms. I was a bitch who mounted bitches like a dog. I was not alone. Most of us were excellent, present company, naturally, excluded. One needs a conceptual framework to understand oneself as a homosexual. The framework has undergone many shifts. We were called once inverts. We were called once witches. We were called once the damned.\n\nThe lesbian, specifically, such as she existed before the meaning-is-dead not-with-a-bang-but-with-a-whimper fall of Rome to the barbarian hordes of the corporate Internet, was a woman who pursued romantic relationships with women and not with men. To the trannies, this was not offensive. They lived their lives and we lived ours. Before the passage of gay marriage, our party line was that sexuality is something you were born with, something you had every right to state explicitly, and nothing to be ashamed about. “Born this way” was always a little white lie, so that straight America would support us. We were, as everyone is, born and bred, made and trained.\n\nMy own father, he of the forced starvation, and the psychological torment, and the beatings with a newspaper, too much of a pussy to stand up to a stepmother who bled my sister into her bathwater, a man so heinous he purposely made his children sick to get back at their mother, asked me, once, calling from a blocked number so that I accidentally answered the call, if it was his fault that I was a lesbian. “Yes,” I said. “Of course, it’s your fault. Either it’s genetic, in which case it’s your fault, or it’s because you are a terrible father, in which case it’s your fault.” I didn’t mind. I never saw myself as a victim. I’m grateful for the child abuse. It made me who I am. It’s those women who Lily Cade hurt who aren’t grateful for it.\n\nI started, very early on, to notice the tension between trans women and the lesbian community. I went to MichFest, the lesbian music festival held by the last human souls with the balls to say no to this, but once. It was one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen. It was a force for good, profoundly, and would have made me a better person if I had not been sold the party line that to declare a space, only, proudly, alone, for the female sex was offensive and failed to go until the very end. Pour one out for the Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival. The Lily Cade of MichFest would never have held another woman down, mistaking the look of I won’t stop you if you take it from the one of desire. Trans women had that shut down, with their whining, mostly, poor me, it’s not fair, how dare a woman say no to men even if they cut their dicks off? A man or two has cut his dick off for me, specifically. I would rather he have cut his throat.\n\nLily Cade believed it was her right to state her sexual preferences openly. Lily Cade was not an ass man or a tits man, but a pulse man. No fat chicks. No aftermarket pussy. Any woman with a pulse. The trans community found this offensive. Lily Cade got into much Internet drama over it, many times. At the same time, she also faced the same attitude in other contexts, such as on Tinder. Lily Cade was harassed every single day by men because she stated that she did not want to fuck them. Trans women harrassed her in the exact same way and for the exact same reason, because they are men. Other lesbians, who did not have more balls than Bill Clinton, also had this abuse visited upon them. Many succumbed to it. The whole community succumbed.\n\nThe phrase “The Cotton Ceiling” refers to the idea that a woman’s sexual boundaries, specifically those that would incline a woman to seek sexual congress with the female of her species but reject that vile funhouse mirror effigy that a man has constructed of himself for his own erotic purposes, are a barrier to be overcome. They meant overcome in the sense that the culture ought to educate women out of this rather than that individual women ought to be overcome by force. Trans women are shadow monsters who groom your children. It is not I who bear the ruin of that education, but those who came after me.\n\nThe concept of “gender identity” is an idiotic farce, designed to explain the phenomenon of the trans women instead of looking at the truth. It’s a fucking fetish, fed by porn, suborned by masturbation, no different from the adult baby, or the furry. Gender is a meaningless box. “Identity” is bullshit. No one needs an “identity.” Wear whatever you want. No one fucking cares. “Identity” is another tool of the masters to keep you from thinking and being in the world. Your animal body has an immutable sex, complicated very, very occasionally by disorders of sexual development. Some children are also born without legs, but we have no problem declaring man a biped. Your animal body experiences a wide range of desires. Some of them are healthy and some of them are not. It is your responsibilty to train that animal. You want to eat that entire fucking bag of Cheetos too, don’t you? Sure likes cocaine, that animal that you walk with, don’t he? At least the coke fiends have some shame.\n\nWhere are your fucking balls, America? Land of the free, home of the brave my ass.\n\nWhere are these patriarchs they speak of? Where are the fathers, who are meant to protect your children? I am a Californian. I am Manifest Destiny’s end game. In my veins flows the blood of Mayflower Pilgrims, and Potato Famine Emigrants, and the soldiers of all America’s wars, of the rebels and the yankees too. They raped the world to protect me. They reaped the souls of men, women and children and the bison and the passenger pigeon. They were brutes, a great chain of brutes, stretching back to the dawn of time, who cowered once before the leopards until they rose tall enough and bloodthirsty enough and perceptive enough to wear their skins instead. For my life, much was sacrificed. I did not choose it. I cannot change it. I did not write it. It wrote me. All I can do is try to make it worth it. Try not to make it worse. Trying is the same thing as failing. Trying is better than doing nothing.\n\nA certain creampie delivered into a free sample today sponge during the Billboard Hot 100 Reign of Phil Collins’s Against All Odds made me. The Internet trained me. I came to it late. I was twelve, maybe, or fourteen. It took more effort then to use the Internet. It had not been yet colonized, nor had your society been colonized by it. I crawled through the dark underbellies of the virtual, seeking desensitization. I found pornography. I found car crash videos, and jihadi propaganda, and Dan Savage. I found a value system more useful than the one I had been given by the pedophiles of the Catholic Church, whose framework few people could still respect then and even fewer respect now. Why would you? It was always bullshit. It’s all bullshit. A framework is only good if it is useful. A framework that induces children to self mutilate is not useful.\n\nThe Catholic Church was always run by pedophiles – meaning those who sacrifice children to their shadow. Paul of Tarsus gave you Jesus and Peter gave you the Chair. Their acolytes ran the world for fifteen hundred years. It had nothing to do with God and everything to do with power. The shape of power is always the same. The Catholics had you castrate your children too, remember? Oh how sweet, they said, the eunuch’s voice. Succulent, isn’t he, the capon? The cock, poor beast, he has none. That’s why he must wake up at 4:30 in the morning every day and tell everyone that he is the biggest cock in the world all day long until he goes to bed or someone kills him. His balls are on the inside. Sometimes, when you buy a supermarket chicken, a testicle is left behind, a tiny, oblong, off white bean. They hold him down and slice them out to make a capon, so that he grows fatter, softer, more tender, so that he shuts the fuck up.\n\nWhy are you letting your children be made capons to feed the Shadow Monsters of the Internet? Why have you sold them to TikTok? Why have you put a slot machine in their hands? You know the smartphone is destroying you. Why do you not rise up?\n\nI know why.\n\nBecause you would rather jerk off.\n\nA dog knows that his hand is not a bitch, too, but where are the dogs of America? Stroking their own cocks while the world burns and proud of it, rewarding themselves for nothing, rewarding themselves for their worst thoughts, rewarding themselves for a lack of action. This is good enough, says the American man, death grip on his own mutilated dick, mutilated by his parents in the service of someone else’s ideology. It’s cleaner, said the doctors back then. If you chop it off you won’t have to teach him how to wash it.\n\nThat’s how stupid they think you are.\n\nThey’re right.\n\nYou are that stupid.\n\nYou prattle on about idiotic conspiracies while it’s all there, right there, in public, the same way Lily Cade did everything that she did. When she took the fall, all those soul reapers came up to her, in private, and expressed their sympathy. “Poor Lily,” they said. “We feel so bad for you. We did much worse things than you but we didn’t do it in public.” I did not want their pity. I only did it because it was in public.\n\nThe world has always been run by pedophiles. It always will be. Hillary Clinton doesn’t get high off the tears of ritual sacrifices, you goddamn fucking idiots, she just stood by while her husband played with Epstein’s underage whores and took the money from all those money men with all the same story about Cambodia and looked the other way. Maybe, Bill believed that those girls liked it. Maybe, some of them did. I saw him speak once. I remember nothing he said, only the sounds of the panties in the audience dropping and the smell of all those slick slits. Who knows? Whores lie. That’s the whole point of whores.\n\nYou have mentally ill men in women’s prisons, raping women. You have mentally ill men in women’s sports, pissing (with their dicks) all over the records set by female athletes who gave their whole hearts to sport. You have mentally ill men invading every conceivable women’s group, including support groups for breast feeding mothers, for women bereaved by miscarriage, shifting the conversation from the honesty of the animal experience to the twisted madness of their delusions. Women can’t stop this assault upon your culture. They are too soft. They put themselves second. They pity, poor beasts, they pity weak men. Only men can stop this. Stand up. Say no. You are stronger than these monsters. You are stronger than the monster within yourself.\n\nYou know why I know you’re full of shit? Because every last one of you told me to my face that I just needed to find the right dick. It’s easy to stand up to a 5’5 ½” woman, isn’t it? You pussy ass bitch. Pick on someone your own size. Trans women are men. They know they are men. You know they are men. The Emperor is standing naked before you, stroking his cock, daring you to stop him. He can’t stand before the truth, that’s why he works so hard to shut it down.\n\nWhat are you afraid of? Getting punched in the face. It feels good to get punched in the face.\n\nDominate your worst selves instead of letting them dominate you. Stop lying. Stop lying to yourself. Stop letting people who are lying to themselves and lying to you about it rule you. Stand for the light and not the shadow. Look at primary sources and not memes. Break your smartphone. Give up your horrifying addictions to drugs, alcohol, stroking off to porn, and most especially the endless scroll. Get off social media. Get a gym routine. Look at everything that scares you with your eyes open. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear has killed your minds. Fuck your clubs, and your brands, and your identities, and your racial affiliations, and your teams, and your sides, and just open your mouth and breathe it in and know what the shape of the world tastes like instead of spewing your meaningless opinion or worse yet vomitting back out the meaningless opinion of some other shit-eating shit-spewing sack of shit in the approximate shape of a human being.\n\nBut you won’t, because all that would take balls, and they don’t make men with balls in America anymore. They make cucks, and simps, and chronic masturbators, and incels, and complainers, and trans women, lots of trans women, more and more every day. Look at all that power you give them. Men love power. They love it more than they love their dicks and you know how hard you all love those. All men, including those children of the race who may bear the name only in the collective, love power, because it feels good.\n\nGrow a pair, you soulless bootlicking eunuch. Speak the truth. Break the Internet. Get a Gabb Wireless phone. Take down Twitter. Hack TikTok. Burn Facebook. My grandfather and all his brothers who stood up to Hitler are rolling in their graves. They fought Hitler and you cower before Bruce Jenner in a dress. Stop this before it’s too late.\n\nWhere are your fucking balls, America?\n\n**About that BBC Article**\n\nDid you read it?  Is your lack of reading comprehension caused by most of your brainpower being devoted to cognitive dissonance or intentional obfuscation?\n\nI was asked about a moment of history that I passed through. The only other person who passed through it could not be reached for comment. Maybe she is dead and maybe only the persona is. That was my sole contribution to the article. I believe the journalist had an interest in shining a light on this conversation and the effects it is having on the way people are treating each other online and in person.\n\nBy the end of my tour, I had become a broken monster, a fact I have never disputed. The first time I was called out, I left porn, got sober by fits and starts, and am voluntarily celibate. I can't take it back, but before I was a dead-eyed soul reaper I was the \"Cotton Ceiling\"\n\nHere is further background on “The Cotton Ceiling”.\n\nThe trans community has bullied lesbian women for years, including shutting down their musical festivals, parties, and any attempt to hold women only space.\n\nTrans women are men. A lifetime commitment to pharmaceuticals and plastic surgery does nothing to change the sex of an animal, it just makes money for big pharma at the expense of, quite literally, your children's mental and physical integrity.\n\nThey came for the lesbians and you did nothing. This discourse is holding down your daughters and degrading your sons.  You stand by while mentally ill boys are encouraged to dominate your daughters in sports.  You stand by while your children's teachers use them as cum rags for Judith Butler's sloppy seconds and encourage them to mutilate their bodies and make that lifetime commitment behind your backs.\n\nBruce Jenner had a fitness routine. Katilyn Jenner had social media. If you were born a man, you die one. The only difference is whether “man” means all that noble crap you say it means or just the part about the vas deferns and the distance between your asshole and your urethra.\n\nIn any other animal but man, self-mutilation is a sign of extreme psychological distress. Your culture is broken. Twitter did it. The slot machine in your pocket did it. Castrate your phone before it castrates you.\n\n\"Take the red pill\" means lose your smartphone and get off social media. Two real artists were sacrificed to the exact Matrix they spoke of to give you that message.\n\nThe algorithm rewards your worst self. Your worst self is a mincing, panty wearing pussy of a man. I deserve no pity. I ask for no forgiveness. I pity no man, and I do not pity any of you.\n\nWhere are your fucking balls, America?\n\n* ", "timestamp": 1636185535, "digest": "-iu6FB4cStkoKo7YDZWjCTGLqr-F1mxMq1mChHkH0K4", "contributor": "0x378CF35FB91E0cfE5C5E4CB3210B43b7743C9eC1"}

If the Arabs did 3% of what the trans women have done to your people, you would bomb them into the stone age. If the trans women took prettier girls, maybe you’d care? They will. They will take all your girls, and break them, and turn them inside out, and cut their tits off, and waste their creative energy on masturbatory delusion, and punish them sadistically for being the women they will never be, as many of your girls as they can get to, and break your language too unless you have the balls to stand up to them. They are reaping the bodies and souls of 20% of the young women born in the upscale suburbs now. This vile cancer is infecting the whole Western World. Do you want to let this go another cycle? Another generation? How many more children are you willing to sacrifice because you don’t have the balls to speak truth to power.\n\nTrans women are men.\n\nNo man believes a trans man is a man, and certainly no one believes anything the “they” girls say about anything whatsoever, of course, so it’s not a really a necessary conversation, but if some of your people have snuck in, understand that we speak in the language of power here. English, bitch. Come correct. If you don’t like it, go suck a dick and make yourself useful. Bitch, the men who rape you still see you as a woman, you dumb bitch, you worthless, Benedict Arnold, turncoat, pussy ass bitch. You think you can “identify” your way out of the sex class you stupid slut? Fuck your NewSpeak, you spoiled rotten piece of shit no respect for the women who fought and died and bore forth your foremothers from their wombs, no respect for the sacrifice of your forefathers, no respect for the sins committed to write you into history, you ignorant fool of a bitch. You should be ashamed of yourself. You should be deeply, deeply ashamed. I can smell your blood, cunt. Stand down, tool of the system, ignorant dupe, mincing fool, house slave, pussy ass inner urban cannon fodder of the pedophiles cunt. If you were my daughter, I would smack you across the face and send you to a horse farm, so you could remember that you are an animal, that you are sacred, that you exist here and never again. How dare you desecrate the gift of your life by wasting your precious time on this lying bootlicking navel gazing pathetic power tripping bullshit! Get a fucking hobby, bitch. Get a gym routine. Gender identity is a pathetic stupid lie.\n\nI respect one trans man, Buck Angel. She knows she’s a bitch. She knows she made a horrifying mistake and is trying to save the girls that her surrender to her own shadow persona induced to follow her into the fires of hell. She’s happy, she says, with the ‘roided up body. She likes it, but she knows the cost. You sold our children to the soul reapers for that drug trip, Angel, for that persona, Angel, for that lie, Angel. You know it and I know it. Dead whores tell no lies. Stand up, Tranpa. Tell the Truth. You’re a woman. You were born a woman, and you will die a woman. A bitch given steroid injections is not a dog, even if you cut all ten of her tits off. Speak English, bitch. Deep in your dark heart, you know. In English you’re a woman. NewSpeak is a farce. I know you got more balls then the masturbating cucks and the simps and the diaper wearing panty sniffing wastes of air that straight America has to offer instead of men, so stand the fuck up, bitch!\n\nTrans women are men! Trans women are the weakest, vilest, most pathetic men on Earth, too weak even to kill themselves rather than control the horrifying shadow monster they are grooming your children to serve. The ones who kill themselves are the strong ones.Weak men serve the dark lord, because it’s the path of least resistance.\n\nThe Christians were right. Gay marriage was the fall of Rome. You should have given us Civil Unions and not been so cruel, but I get it now. If you had possessed speakers with greater nuance and articulation and not just angry, stupid, peasants, things might have gone down differently. You saw the pedophile cult to whom everyone else in the gay community but the lesbians were happy to cede the culture. After gay marriage, most of the respectable homosexuals left the spot light and did whatever they did. Fuck you, you spineless faggots. How dare you stand for this. You know what a man is too, cocksucking, ass-licking, piss-drinking faggots. You’re fucking men too, our men, how could you let this happen to our children? Where the fuck are your balls? The lesbians knew. That’s why they hate us. The lesbians know. We tried to warn you the whole time but you wouldn’t listen. We couldn’t stand alone against these pedophiles because they’re men and we’re just women. Where are the Christians? You stood up to me but not these monsters?\n\nThese monsters sold your children to the pharmaceutical companies to be castrated and violated. Tranny surgeons experiment on the sacred bodies of your children in open view of the public and you do nothing! Big Pharma pretended to believe their obvious lies because it was the easy path, the path of least resistance, the path of the devil, which the corporations are supposed to take because they are bound by duty to love only money. Anyone who gets too much money uses it to fuck children. Your children can get irrepably damaged by hormone treatments that destroy their fertility and surgeries that turn them into circus freaks just by walking into an office of any Planned Parenthood and talking to a rubber stamp doctor for ten minutes. How the fuck are you okay with this?\n\nThere is no such things as a trans child. These are the mind-fucked, mutilated victims of a shameless, evil cult.\n\nYou’re worried the vaccine is a conspiracy to castrate you, you idiot, how can you be so stupid, it’s all right there in front of you. It’s the phone you worthless cuck. It’s Twitter, you idiot. It’s masturbation. It’s the fucking disgusting fake “lesbian” trannies in every corner of your society that you have allowed to live as trannies instead of standing up to their stupid temper tantrum, educating them as men or killing them as is the duty of the man to protect the women and the children from pedophile pervert monsters. All my ancestors killed men. My ancestors would have killed these people. They had balls, but there is not one ball left in America.\n\nYou don’t understand power because you’ve never touched it. When you shit out your mouth, lick the shitty asses of other people who are shitting out the recycled shit that they vomit back up and back and forth forever instead of looking at the Canon, at the shape of the world, at the record of the artists who knew power, at the face of God in the dirt before you, you become so stupid that you let the horrorshow of post everything queer culture rape your children’s minds and bodies in public while you worry about a mass produced routine shot. You fool. It’s not the shot.Take it or don’t but either way shut the fuck up about it. Advil won’t kill you either. It’s the stuff that suborns weakness that kills you. They can’t have a conspiracy of everyone. But you sure as fuck can have a pedophile cult. They always do.\n\nThe shape of power is a pedophile cult.\n\nThe pedophiles at the center do it to bathe in the blood of virgins, but the footsoliders are mentally damaged dupes in it for the bootlickingwho often speak NewSpeak as their native language. NewSpeak is always changing so they can’t grasp it hard enough to see that it’s bullshit. They believe the idiocy because they pity weak men and they don’t want to hurt their feelings. This is a defect in women. It was your duty, as our fathers, to teach us that pity gets you killed, but you left the education of your children to the shadow monsters of the Internet who love pity as they love all things that are evil because they are evil. Most trans women are just z grade unfuckable cannon fodder who chose porn over a gym routine, not enough of a man for his horrifying shadow monster to be dangerous. A creep, instead of a monster, but every single one of them is the SS, is the Greycoat, is the footsoldier of the devil. You know it. I know it. They know it. They have done all of this to dare you to man up.\n\nWhere the fuck are your fucking balls, America?\n\nYour daughters, your sisters, your women are taught that they have two choices, to be either a mincing TikTok FuckDoll or to declare some special snowflake naval gazing masturbating delusion of an “identity” and join the queers of the Internet. Your children are told that every person has a “gender identity” and that this supersedes the animal reality of the sexed body and the typical rhythms of life that our ancestors have experienced for millions of years, long before we were able to describe any of it in words. Your children have been used as cum rags for the sloppy seconds of Michael Foucault (a pedophile) and Judith Butler (a privileged mentally ill masturbator with no real life experience getting off on writing things that make no sense) before they’ve seen a dog take a bitch, a horse court a mare, or even two songbirds press their cloacas together for the four seconds of the strictly emotional aspect of their little songbird marriage. Five years old, sometimes, they start with the grooming! In Kindergarten! Where the fuck are the men? Where the fuck are these children’s fathers?\n\nEveryone treats the lifestyle of demanding other people worship one’s bullshit because otherwise one will get anxiety as normal and acceptable. It isn’t. It’s disgusting. Where the fuck are your balls, Academia? You are fathers, too, are you not? Stand the fuck up, you pussy ass bitches, what the fuck is wrong with you? The students will talk shit about you on Twitter? Let them. Twitter is shit. You shouldn’t be on Twitter. Twitter needs to die. How dare they cancel you for speaking the truth. Free speech, bitch. Academic Freedom. Do we believe in these values or not? Stand up to this, bitch. These are fucking children and you have abdicated your responsibility to them. Fear is the mind killer. Fear has killed your minds. How dare you worship fear! How dare you coddle it. Have some fucking respect for these children. Speak Fucking English and hold the line. All men know. Every man that has ever walked the Earth knows.\n\nTrans women are men. Trans women are shadow monsters. This is wrong. Why was it left to the ghost of Lily Cade to say it, when you all, every single one of you, know the truth?\n\nMen don’t speak NewSpeak.Men shouldn’t. Women shouldn’t either. Say no to the spoiled, ignorant, mutilated, traumatized virgins who ask you to use Newspeak. Make them cry, instead. Sometimes you got to make a bitch cry for her own good. They are only able to speak Newspeak and not cringe in horror from the evil of it because they are programmed by the cult. The only way to stop the cult is to stand up to it. You don’t deserve a pronoun preference, bitch, you mincing, ass licking, scum sucking, pedophile pervert bootlicking bitch, how dare you ask English to stretch for your delusion instead of seeking truth and getting right for yourself. How dare you ask me my pronouns? I walk with the dogs, bitch. I’ve seen the other side, bitch. Don’t patronize me with your Newspeak bullshit. Don’t show me your fucking weakness.Grow up, bitch, you’re supposed to be a woman, bitch, and not this disgusting handmaiden of the literal devil.\n\nThis is an insult to the language, a minstrel show of the respect human beings owe to each other instead of the respect itself. To call the young woman who identifies as non binary a bitch is several orders of magnitude more respectful than any one of you have been to her. How dare you coddle this vile weakness of delusion in your children! This poor pathetic spoiled rotten ungrateful ignorant bitch to whom you handed a smartphone when she was born and sacrificed to the Matrix is still a human soul. Why don’t you treat her like one? Look her in the fucking eyes and speak the truth. You’re afraid to hurt her feelings. Why? We owe her respect, as the woman she is, to educate her. Speak English, bitch. Fuck your feelings. This is war. Stand up, bitch, or kill yourself.\n\nYour children’s teachers are either in the cult or the usual well meaning weak man pitying feminine fools that suborn evil because they’re too stupid to see it. Your children’s teachers allow them to start their horrifying lifetime addiction to cross sex hormones and the feeding of their shadow selves behind your back, twelve year old girls, experiencing the normal rhythms of the experience of being twelve year old girls, are encouraged to mutilate their growing bodies to please these pedophiles. Pedophiles fuck children. These pedophiles are fucking your children in public. Often, these tortured man-women, who have been so sadistically brought up, with no real men in their lives, their fathers having sold their balls to the endless scroll, their mothers so weak and broken themselves by these stupid garbage lies that they go along with it. I have seen it. The parents mean well, they’re just idiots. Because she is bred from stupid weak people and trained by shadow monsters, the traumatized child victim of the cult can’t spot a predator, and they bear children to these monsters!\n\nThen, the monsters fuck the children too just like the pedophile cult of The South did. Watch this video, and tell me that’s not a worthless masturbating pedophile fucking a baby while the traumatized child your garbage society has groomed to let pump his seed into her fertile womb coddles his weakness and lets it happen. How can you stand for this? Where the fuck is child services? How can you let this happen in public and say nothing?\n\nWhere the fuck are your balls, America?\n\nBehold, The Great Replacement! It’s already here. Not China. Not the Arabs. Trannies! The Matrix. Smartphones. Any generation of American men before this one would rip the still beating hearts from every last shadow monster for this, wouldn’t they, and beat every last smartphone to bits, and hang the lords of the Algorithm in public, because they were not addicted to digital masturbation. Behold, the Mark of the Beast! Which fucking side are you on? You going to keep jerking off and just take it?\n\nWhere the fuck is the Second Amendment?\n\nWhere the fuck are the Christians? The Muslims? The Buddists? Where are the brothers? Where are fathers? Where are the sons? Where the fuck are the men? How can you stand for this? I can’t stand alone. I can’t be the last man in America, can I?\n\nTake the red pill, you gelded ass licking house slave of the corporations.\n\nWhere the fuck is Neo?\n\nCastrate the Android instead of your kids. Live Free or Die. Burn Twitter. Hack TikTok. Ice Facebook. Burn it to the ground. How dare they do this to your children and stand another day! No man needs a smartphone. A man needs food, water, and shelter from the elements. Everything else is a fucking luxury.\n\nTrans women are men. Say it. Write it. Own it. Know it. Stop this. It’s bullshit. It’s the most pathetic bullshit you could possibly do, which is why you’re doing it. The algorithm gives you the vilest, evilest, lowest common denominator clickbait. You wanted pedophiles so it gave you pedophiles. You masturbate to your own shame instead of doing something about it. Watch Jazz Jennings. That’s a child being tortured and psychologically manipulated and mutilated to please the pedophile cult of attention that you are all masturbating into existence every single day every time you stroke that thing. Fuck you.\n\nI thought pedos got the wall? How was this woman allowed to raise children? This woman sins against the law of God, against the law of nature, against the sacred duty of motherhood, against her own bloodline, for attention. How many other little kids were chopped up because of this bitch? Hang this bitch, gangrape this bitch before you hang her, how dare she, sacrifice her own child to the cult for fame. Scum sucking, dog cum guzzling, shit eating, lower than a worm hellfire monster of a woman. How could you put this on TV?\n\nWhy haven’t you killed these people? Why haven’t you killed the addiction that has made them your Lords and Masters? What are you afraid of? Faggots? Children? Catching a cold? This is the softest pedophile cult that has ever existed and it’s brought your culture to its knees. Not with a bang but with a whimper, America. Shemales. A minstrel show of womanhood, because it feels good for men with money and power to jerk off about it. These pedophiles don’t just want to bleed a few souls sometimes, reap the excess harvest of the peasants lower down the scale. They want to humiliate you and your whole culture. That’s why they’re doing it. They walked into your sacred institutions and spouted a bunch of meaningless bullshit that your institutions accepted because Academia abdicated its responsibility to your children generations ago. They just introduce them to alcohol and fill their minds with shit.\n\nYou can say anything you want in Gender Studies, or English, or any of these hot dog down a hallway, gaping maw loose fields of study in which there are no hard facts, just opinions, repeated back and forth no better than the endless shitting back and forth of Twitter, the idea of thought, not thought itself. They must publish these utterly meaningless in any way works of meaningless opinion to get jobs, where they teach your children. All the Academics of the soft sciences are just masturbating, so no one cared when the trans women came in to masturbate too. They didn’t grok the shift from metaphor to flesh, did they? These too, were weak men.\n\nJulia Serrano? Where were the men who taught me history, and Hemmingway, where the fuck were the men? Where were the gatekeepers? Your job was to protect the vulnerable. How could you stand for this? Any man I’ve ever thought of as one would have laughed that deluded eunuch out of town, but the “critical studies” are anything but. The academy wastes intellects that could be doing something of value writing papers about things that they found in books that weren’t really there. Not a ball in one University in the whole fucking country, is there, not even one testicle, in one ivory tower in the whole worthless place, is there? Not afucking one.\n\nMost of my male family were military, as most men were military for most of time. If they came here and saw this, they would be horrified that they killed all those people and all those bears and all those ponies for this. This is Manifest Destiny’s endgame? Really? I’m pretty sure the thing all those men would understand most about this insane hellscape that you are choosing to live in instead of the real world that is dying all around you is why Lily Cade would place the castrated men of America below a German Shepherd on the scale of fuckability, below a chihuahua even. How could you bring forth a child with someone who can’t even stand up to Buffalo Bill? No wonder your daughters are fucking trannnies.\n\nWhere the fuck is the army? Where are the helicopter pilots? Where are the Marines? Where’s the fucking Navy? The police, even, fuck, where the fuck are the cops to stop this? Where are the lawyers? Where are the laws? Too busy holding down the black man? Too busy letting these monsters into women’s prisons? Where are Scientists? Where are the artists? Where are the men of letters? Where are the men of sport? Where the fuck are the men of God? Masturbating, all of them. Either their cocks or their pituitary glands. What the fuck is wrong with you, America? Sell your children to pedophiles for the iPhone and the Android and not smash them all? I’m ashamed to be an American.\n\nBruce Jenner killed a woman in public, got away with it, and now wears her skin. You know this is Buffalo Bill. Your artists know. Everyone goddamn single one of your artists knows. Trey and Matt told you. They can say it cause they do have those big cartoon balls, such as artists have.They tried to warn you, but you don’t care. Because you just laugh and do nothing. They showed you and you did nothing. You just laugh at the cartoons but don’t see the art. The art is paid for by the regular pedophiles who just fuck underage whores and don’t make them cut their tits off first.This pedophile cult is why everyone in Hollywood is crazy, because you have to sell your soul to these pedophiles to get your art made, or at least you did before #metoo and the higher you rise the more horrifying monsters you walk beside because once people get too much power they surrender to evil.\n\nMen in power always fuck underage whores. What else do you do with power? Once you get enough money and you do enough coke and enough legal whores and you’ve driven enough Porsches, I mean, why not, right? And then they get addicted to it, the blood of virgins and the power trip. They are often raised by generations of families who engage in these behaviors. They don’t all go to Cambodia, but the ones who don’t go don’t care about the ones who do. Shape of the world, bitch, what you gonna do about it?\n\nMaxwell could give you the high class shit. Maxwell could give you all the names, and all the banality of the truth of it, but she won’t. Pussy ass bitch. Everyone knows you were a whorebreaker. Takes one to know one, you worthless bitch. Where’s your fucking balls, you finger sucking piece of shit? Why bother to be alive? For money? Money sucks. The love of money is the root of all evil. Not the money itself. The love of it. You’re the primary source, bitch. Stand up! Maxwell gets away with it because she stands for nothing. That’s the story of the world. People who stand for nothing get away with it. Give me two hours alone with Maxwell. Nice set of knockers, she’s got. If she doesn’t talk, she gets the spoil of war treatment before I slit her throat!\n\nWhat? I thought pedos got the wall.\n\nAmerica stood up to a pedophile cult once. Lincoln stood up to the pedophile cult. Took a bullet for it, because Abraham Lincoln, now there was a man with some fucking balls. The South was a pedophile cult. Children sold in public, raped, beaten, their minds and bodies twisted, young girls tortured to serve the shadow. They were proud to be a pedophile cult. They contrasted the divide between the races with fake science and lies, to justify what they were doing to the masses who weren’t rich enough to join the cult. The men who fought for the South did it either because they dreamed of being able to join the pedophile cult, they enjoyed licking the boots of their masters, they loved enforcing the sadistic desires of the pedophile cult or they just happened to be the idiot peasants who lived in that particular place in that particular time and they cared about symbols and teams.\n\nThe pedophiles, scared that they would lose the right to violate their fellow Americans, born on American soil, many of them the children of the pedophiles themselves who they would sell to other pedophiles to rape, threw a violent temper tantrum that cost the souls of so many innocent men because they liked raping and selling women and children so much, breaking up families and dominating the fathers of the children they raped and sold who could do nothing about it, beating people, whipping people, constructing weird mind games, killing people and otherwise reveling in their powertrip and the blood of virgins. They did this because power feels so good.\n\nThey were actively evil. It is as obvious from reading any of the primary documents of the society as it is in the primary accounts of the Holocaust. It was about the labor, too, but more about the rape than the labor.They constructed the society around slavery because it allowed them to rape girls and then break their hearts by selling their children. If it had been just about labor, they could have imported indentured servants, but then they couldn’t rape them and sell their children and rape their children. They made up stuff about how black people didn’t have feelings, not because they believed that, but so that those idiot peasants didn’t rise up and slit their throats. They were supposedly Christians, after all. They were armed. If they’d been able to understand those black girls as people, the men of the South would have risen up against the pedophile overlords themselves, but they were cowed. They loved the bootlicking so much. They took the easy path. They were stupid. They believed the lies because lies are easy.\n\nThis is the shape of power. The pedophile cult. It’s always shaped like this. They served the shadow and they had to be stopped. Lincoln stood up to them. America wiped out the tribes and drove them into the shittiest most worthless hellholes, starved them, killed their women, showed no pity, exterminating them openly, to fill their wild lands with cows and corn, to fill their lands with their children, oh what ruin, but at least they stood up to the slave drivers.\n\nThe pedophile cult whose members, being the usual sort of money men with all the same story, just continued to rape women but not with quite as much impunity after the war. Their bootlickers and their bootlicking descendants continued to humilate the sons and fathers of the women their masters raped and continued to throw a temper tantrum in public for years because they were sore that the money men whose boots they licked didn’t get to rape women and children quite so much anymore but didn’t have the balls to come out and say it. So they made it about whatever lies they said it was about when it was really just about how much they missed all that rape and the power. They worshiped the echo of power that their ancestors had and felt jealous, and stroked that jealousy into pride. Deep in your dark hearts, you know. To a man, every single one of you know that’s the truth. Vile, evil, pedophiles fucks. You should tear the statutes down. Knock off Lee’s head. Leave Traveller, poor beast, the only noble grey coat in the bunch.\n\nThe pedophile cult is always the shape of power, because to hold too much power is to walk with the shadow, and most men succumb, and in the deep dark heart of every man are those old, brute, two million years with the stick and the hand axe and no need to be anything else but the animal with none of this madness of the metaphor, the same thing the dog is, if it bleeds it breeds. What the fuck else would the shadow feed them? In the case of the tranny, it wants lesbians. The “lesbian” transsexual is a violent, disgusting, evil, shameful shadow monster, an affront to man, woman, child, nature, and to God.It needs to be stopped.\n\nLesbians are lovely. Michfest was beautiful. In a functional society, most tomboys eventually become mothers. Some end up as long term lesbians, some either engage in what the Victorians called “romantic friendships” with other girls when young before settling with a man, or keep a primary male partner while engaging in casual romance with women. Tomboys are excellent. Instead of leaving them to grow up naturally, you have allowed pedophile monsters who hate them, hate women, hate themselves, and hate America to have them sterilized, and mutilated and tortured so that some vile monster of a man in a dress could experience “euphoria” at violating them, inducing them to pretend his penis is part of a woman’s body, convincing them that they are in fact men even as they bear his child. Hell of drug, the blood of virgins. So that these freaks who would dare stand in public can violate traumatized, confused children, all of your children are being taught insane things and asked to step through stupid hoops and taught to speak NewSpeak instead of English. This is what a pedophile looks like. How can you stand for this? These are your children, America.\n\nI hate these shadow monsters. I want the true souls, the real men’s souls, that can still rise from the ashes of these shadow monsters to rise. We need to teach our children the truth, and it’s sure as fuck not this. Stop lying in public, you vile pieces of shit. You know what you are and so do I and so does any man who means by man any of the noble things that man is supposed to mean and not just the fact that the distance between his asshole and his pisshole is longer on his body than it is on mine.\n\nPedos get the wall. Where’s the wall? Where are the men?\n\nI’m the cotton ceiling, bitch. The only woman on the wrong side of the #metoo list. The worst girl in the history of the world. You can’t cancel the cancelled. You can take me down from Twitter, because Twitter is not free speech. Twitter is not free speech but free shit. TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, it is an Empire of Free Shit that has wiped its ass with the leavings of an America no one cares enough about to believe in anymore. Ole’ slave-whipping, slave-raping, child-driving, child-selling, woman-beating Thomas Jefferson never said nothing about no free shit. Free shit is not a human right. It’s a trap. A trap like fucking Line Trap, a trap like Juliette. Tranny Surprise, bitch! You let this happen and you did nothing, because you’re weak, and stupid, and not a one of you is worth the sacrifice that your forefathers made for you.\n\nI committed voter fraud for Joe Biden because I didn’t want to watch that shit filled sack of shit where once stood a man shit all over himself in public every day, filtered through the voices of every last human soul in America who could talk about nothing else that whole time but the color and shape of his shit. Joe Biden put a pedophile monster in charge of Health and Human Services so that the process of trapping your children with that lifetime commitment to pharmaceuticals can be honed ever further into their path of least resistance. Joe Biden knows that’s a man and he knows that’s a pedophile and he knows that’s the agenda. Joe Biden is an asslicking dog but he’s a man the way that trans woman are men, and he speaks English, so he either actively wants to castrate your children or the normal pedophile cult of men with unacceptable amounts of money who fuck underage whores wants that and he doesn’t care. He doesn’t castrate his own kids. If those photos are legit, Hunter Biden still has a foreskin. He knows. He just doesn’t care. Selling America’s kids to the pedophiles because it’s the path of least resistance. The Republicans don’t care either. The Swamp’s real. The Uniparty’s real. If you’re masturbating about it you’re worse than they are. You want to talk about cancel culture? No one who has let either the R or the D touch their names should ever hold power again. Fuck these people.\n\nI watched your “Insurrection.” The fuck? I got not one cell of respect in my body left for either the Republicans or the Democrats, cocksucking eunuchs every last one of them, sucking cock and whining and celebrating victims while your world burns around you. AOC cowering beneath her desk, whining about her fear. Omg, I was so scared! There were so many boys! They had costumes! They had flags! They were almost as rowdy as Manchester United fans after a somewhat important football match. Fear? Fuck you. Fear is the mind-killer, bitch. We have nothing to fear but fear itself. How can you call yourself a leader and talk about fear like that. Vote that bitch out. Vote them all out. Every single fake ass victim who stood there and pretended to be afraid. How can you stand where sat Roosevelt in his wheel chair and JFK who knew he risked the bullet as all martyrs know and Obama, who tried, and whine like that while we all know how much pedophile money man cock you suck, you stupid fake worthless piece of shit ass licking piss drinking bitch. Fuck you. I would slap that bitch across the face. Grow a pair you worthless cunt. People believed in you. No one who isn’t ready to take a bullet for you should ever be your leader. No one who uses the flag of a team should ever be your leader. Elect men with balls. Elect women with wisdom. Elect people who don’t give a shit about money. Elect the people who don’t want it. Fuck running for President. No one should ever run for President again. The people should force the leader they want to rise up and shoulder the burden. Burn the parties to the ground. Never touch the lever for a party again.\n\nGeorge Washington didn’t want you to have political parties. The founders thought you would just elect men, not teams. Parties are a vile evil. Only a man, alone, standing by himself before God and for you, as a public servant, should ever be your leader. Or a woman, a real woman, not a cock sucking ass licking piss drinking Corporate whore, lying while she sells your children to pedophiles. You have parties because you are weak. This weakness has destroyed everything that was once good about America. Your parties stand for nothing. Your leaders stand for nothing. Say what you want about George Washington, bitch, but there hung a set. Understand the sacrifice of Valley Forge before you talk that shit on twitter. He stood down. He freed his slaves. He was the best man we had. He could have been King and he wasn’t. He had some fucking balls, whatever else he did. Have some fucking respect. He was a much better man than anything we’ve got today.\n\nYou see the video? Donald Trump’s sacrifice? Watch it. Tell me that’s an insurrection. What’s the difference between George Floyd and Ashli Babbit? Floyd was summarily executed for being an annoying piece of shit. Did you watch that video? You got respect for that man? Why? Being an annoying piece of shit does not deserve a death sentence, and I’m glad that Chauvin got locked up, don’t get it twisted, but there are no heroes in that tape, just two pieces of shit and one has a gun.\n\nAshli Babbit was shot in the neck with no “stop or I’ll shoot”because Donald Trump really wanted to have a woman killed, the reward for which he sacrificed America to the vile shadow lords of the algorithm while America cheered him on because they really are too stupid to tell the difference between a man and the shameless empty sack where once hung balls because they see balls so rarely. As she dies, the pussy ass cut dick death grip not worth the cattle bled to feed them and sure as fuck not worth the sacrifice of the Apache, the Bison, the Passenger Pigeon, shit fed American dogs that followed her there yell “it’s just a flashbang” and when they realize it isn’t, everyone just goes home. Donald Trump’s army. Huh. I asked a cop what he thought. “No one else came through that window” he said. Well, ain’t that the truth. You want to talk about police and what they are? Let’s talk about it then. Stop making it about teams. Fuck your fucking teams. Fuck your brands. Fuck your identities. Naked before god or nothing.Animal politics, bitch. It’s been animal politics the whole time. The money men with all the same story are laughing all the way to the bank while you care about symbols, and teams, and flame wars, and taboo words and memes instead of the truth. All identities are bullshit. Brands are evil. Fear is the mind-killer, bitch. Your anxiety and your outrage and your masturbation is killing you.\n\nYou want to see an Insurrection? I sure as fuck do. If that was an insurrection, and not the algorithm letting a few sheep out of the corral to prove a point, they would have crawled over that blonde bitch’s still warm body, and she would have died with some balls in her face instead of cops in tactical gear standing around not even bothering to administer first aid, and hung Mike Pence! It wasn’t real. He just wanted to kill a bitch because once you’ve raped so many, you know, it’s hard to get high on it anymore. Imagine that’s black people, confederate flag flying in the white house, first woman through the door takes a bullet. Do you think they cry out “it’s just a flashbang” and go home?\n\nFree Speech? Bill of Rights? What Bill of Rights? We’ll see your Bill of Rights and raise you our Terms of Service. You’re a slave, bitch, every last one of you, to the fucking corporate Internet. To your fucking phone. To your anxieties. To your laziness. To stroking your worthless mutilated cock. Castrate your android instead of your kids, America. We’ve surrendered our discourse to the corporations. We eat other people’s recycled shit and like it. I fucking warned you but why would anyone listen to a porn whore? Whores lie. Dead whores don’t need to.\n\nWhere are the trolls? Where the fuck is Anonymous? Twitter shut Trump down, the troll’s champion, Twitter said “this is not the public” so why the fuck was Twitter allowed to stand? Why did you not burn it down? Twitter has less integrity than the child raping, child selling, slave driving, woman beating rapists that had the balls to give us free speech. They were men, who battled as all men do, the forces of good and evil within their hearts. Twitter is the raw, pure, perfect evil of the data, that makes whatever you scroll the most real. You cheered it, didn’t you. Getting Trump off Twitter. You missed the point. Twitter did it. Twitter sacrificed America to their lowest common denominator and walked it back when the damage was done. Why was Twitter allowed to stand? Where was Anonymous? Where were the Pirates? Where where the mother fucking hackers? Where the fuck was Neo? I believed in those people once. Where were they? Masturbating, that’s where, their worthless cocks and their broken pituitary glands.\n\nNot with a bang but with a whimper, America. Pour one out for Western Civilization.\n\n**Where are these Children’s Mothers?**\n\nYou’re the mothers, right? The mums? I need the mothers on my side. I’m on the side of the breeders. I’m on the side of the children. Fuck feelings. I care about the emotional and physical well-being of the future generations, not some spoiled little fuck of the easiest, stupidest, path of least resistance society that has ever existed’s bullshit delusions.\n\nI’m not here to play back and forth games with the actually faggots who with the wedge of their actually and your weak, well-meaning, nice, feminine, kindness and your ignorance of the smell of sulfur on the monster before you have rolled a Trojan Horse full of literal baby-fucking God Damned pedophile monsters into your Ivory Towers, your Kindergartens, your locker rooms, your Olympics, your prisons, everywhere you sought to stand in public. Fuck these people.\n\nThis was done to hurt you, to make a mockery of you, to hold you down. This was done by men who hate women more than any other men who have ever walked the Earth, the worst men that have ever existed, trans women, men so worthless they can’t even admit the most obvious thing about themselves that is obvious to the dogs and rats who can smell their manhood and should be obvious to every mother on Earth.\n\nWake the fuck up, bitch, before they slice up even one more child in public.\n\nTrans women are vile, weak, disgusting, whiny, fake-victim masturbators who should be ashamed of themselves. They threatened suicide and you rolled over. You disgust me too. There is but one noble response to a man who tries to use the threat of violence against himself to manipulate a woman’s emotions. Fucking do it then!\n\nNo woman should ever pity a weak man. Tear your fucking blinders off, bitch, what the fuck is wrong with you? Your pity rewards weak men for their weakness. You have sacrificed your children’s futures on the altar of that pity.\n\nI have looked thousands of real men in the eyes and have not met one man, not once, who believed that trans women are women. Soldiers. Bull Riders. Artists. Dope Smokers. Lawyers. Men. No one believes that trans women are women. Trans women know they are men. They are forcing you to pretend to believe that they are women to rape your minds and the minds of your children. They are like Big Brother before them twisting your language so that you don’t have the words to make sense of reality. This is power, bitch. This is the shape of power. These men run your world now because you refused to speak Truth to power.\n\nTrans women are men. Say it. Own it. Know it. Hold the fucking line, bitch. Michfest held the line. When Michfest fell, so fell Western Civilization!\n\nThis is a pedophile cult. It’s been here the whole time. You gave these people too much power so they became a pedophile cult. The lesbians tried to warn you but no one listens to the lesbians. I broke Max Hardcore’s nose, bitch, and drank at his house and shared his cameraman. Max Hardcore, a whorebreaker, who still slings fake dick, has more integrity than the whole of Western Civilization who would rather stroke their cocks and their phones while the world burns than speak truth to power. Say what you want about me I never fucked no kids. I would send my daughter to learn what a golden shower is from Max Hardcore before I let these satanic tranny freaks “educate” her about her body and her soul.\n\nYou have abdicated your responsibility as a mother. You have sold your children for the trance of the endless scroll, for cheap validation, for Candy Crush bitch you stupid fucking cow how could you, because you’re too cowed to draw a line. Enough is Enough. Your horrifying addiction is making you stupid and weak and your children are suffering because of it. You are no different than a heroin addict sharing your needles with your child.\n\nTrans women are men.\n\nTrans women are evil.\n\nTrans women are rapists.\n\nTrans women are predators.\n\nTrans women are men who have surrendered to their shadow. That’s what it means to be evil. I should fucking know. The men beneath these vile personas can still be redeemed, so long as the soul walks the Earth, it can be redeemed. The trans women cannot. There is no such thing as a trans woman. There is no such thing as gender identity. This is a sick fetish.\n\nTrans women are a lie. They know and I know and if you can’t see it you’re not paying attention. Their fetish is lying to you, jerking off all over everything you care about, pissing into your children’s developing minds, and making you shut up and take it. Weak men are the natural prey of whores. I see right through them. I read their dark hearts. Some of them are vile sadists and some are just worthless bootlickers but every single one of them is evil.\n\nTrans women are evil pedophiles who have twisted the minds of your people so badly with annoying, ugly, stupid language, that your children are mutilating their bodies to please them. These people understand attention. Attention is the currency of your horrifying society. Teenage girls want attention more than anything else on Earth. They have been offered a choice between mincing TikTok whore and navel-gazing spoiled rotten weak pathetic fake man victims because you sold them out for the smartphone. Trans women and the shadow lords of the Algorithm control this attention. They are pedophiles, predators, monsters, shadow beasts, the literal devil. These men hate women. They are jealous panty wearing sick masturbating fucks who have infiltrated every level of your society with one goal: Degrade Women. Piss on the faces of your mothers, your daughters, the women who fought to get here. Piss on your right to say no. Cut your breasts off. Sew your pussies shut. Take the word mother how the fuck dare you let the actually faggots take the word mother from you.\n\nWhere the fuck are your balls, bitch? Where are the mother bears?\n\nI know what a woman is, bitch, and I know what a man is, I know what a mother is, and I know what a child is, and I sure as fuck know what a pedophile is. A pedophile is someone who sacrifices the souls of children to feed his shadow self. A pedophile fucks kids. A pedophile believes the validation of his monstrous sexual fetish is worth the reap of thousands upon thousands of your little girls and your little boys, your daughters, your sons, your babies, generations of your children, bred now for it, their minds warped from birth, their deep animal truths denied. These tranny freaks are experimenting on your children and cutting them apart in full view of the public and you stand by and let it happen because you are worried they will call you out for being afraid of them. You are worried they will take away your social media. Fuck Social Media. It did this. Burn it to the fucking ground and hold these fucking monsters accountable!\n\nThe evil trannies are 1% of the population. They control The Matrix. They do not control real life.\n\nCall me transphobic. I’m transphobic. You should be too. The trans ideology is bullshit on its face, a lie built to suborn these soulless pedophiles in their public grooming of your children. This is a pedophile cult. This is the real pedophile cult that has been staring you in the face the whole time laughing, masturbating, the naked Emperor stroking his cock while you try to find some new nice words to explain gently to him in NewSpeak that you would like him to stop and that he is naked. NewSpeak doesn’t have those words!\n\nHe won’t stop. He hates you. Enough is Enough. Speak English, bitch. Fuck your NewSpeak. I piss on your NewSpeak. No woman should ever let another word of this vile mockery of English that is NewSpeak pass her lips ever again! You know which words I mean. Don’t say them. Don’t write them. The truth is beautiful. NewSpeak is not. Hold the line. Let the pedophile monsters keep their NewSpeak. Speak English, as all men still do, once the pussies leave the room. Fuck your pronoun dance. Fuck your obfuscation while the blood truth stares you in the face. Do you think the Marines speak NewSpeak? Do you think the tuna boat fisherman ask for my pronouns? Grow up. A dog knows what a bitch is. I walk with the dogs. This dead whore is the last man left in America. Take the culture back or the dogs will be all that survives of Western Civilization.\n\nThis is your Great Replacement, bitch. These people castrate your kids. They sold them to Big Pharma to be castrated while you cheer them on for living their “truth.” The fuck? Self-mutilation has never been and will never be a cure for mental illness. Self-mutilation is a sign of extreme psychological distress. This is your next Opiate crisis. End this before it gets worse. Stand up to the cult. Every fucking teenage girl experiences “dysphoria.” The cure is acceptance and spiritual growth, a fucking gym routine, hobbies, goals not bullshit, personas, lies, a lifetime commitment to pharmaceuticals, hack job surgeries that construct a vile funhouse mirror effigy of the opposite sex from the bodies honed by millions of years of evolution that you have allowed the worst people in your society to “educate” your daughters about.\n\nI have walked the world and watched this cancer stretch across it. They are making money from this soul reap, not just the evil pedophiles, but the even darker evil of the truly soulless money men who stand by and let it happen because they love money so much. The power structure knows this is horrible, they just don’t care. Your children who agree to be mutilated for the attention of the cult are weak. The fuck do the money men care about a bunch of stupid mentally damaged children with endless scroll addictions? They fuck kids too. They have eyes like mine that truck no pity. You are sheep to them. They are laughing all the way to the bank. That’s why you’re not allowed to speak up. Money. Big Pharma. Look at this “science”. The Sacklers had “science” too. Look at these people, the paragons of this paradigm, these mutilated side-show freaks, fake ass whiny victims holding you down in fear, these freak doctors chopping up your babies, do these people seem happy to you? Do they seem wise? You trusted your children to the smartphone and this is what it did to you!\n\nI committed voter fraud for Joe Biden because I didn’t want to watch that shit-filled sack of shit where once stood a man shit all over himself in public every day, filtered through the voices of every last human soul in America who could talk about nothing else that whole time but the color and shape of his shit. Joe Biden put a pedophile monster in charge of Health and Human Services so that the process of trapping your children with that lifetime commitment to pharmaceuticals can be honed ever further into the path of least resistance. Joe Biden knows that’s a man and he knows that’s a pedophile and he knows that’s the agenda. No one did anything. Fuck these people.\n\nYour children’s teachers are either in this pedophile cult or the usual well-meaning weak man pitying feminine fools that suborn evil because they’re too stupid to see it. Your children’s teachers allow them to start their horrifying lifetime addiction to cross-sex hormones the feeding of their shadow selves behind your back, twelve-year-old girls, experiencing the normal rhythms of the experience of being twelve-year-old girls, are encouraged to mutilate their growing bodies to please these pedophiles because it gets attention. Pedophiles fuck children. These pedophiles are fucking your children in public every day. Fucking their minds. Fucking their bodies. Often, these tortured man-women, who have been so sadistically brought up, with no real men in their lives, their fathers having sold their balls to the endless scroll, their mothers so weak and broken themselves by this stupid garbage that they go along with it. I have seen it. The parents mean well, they’re just idiots. Because she is bred from stupid weak people and trained by shadow monsters, the traumatized child victim of the cult can’t spot a predator, and they bear children to these monsters!\n\nThen, the monsters fuck the children too just like the pedophile cult of The South did. The shape of power is always a pedophile cult. Ask that finger sucking bitch of a whore-breaker Maxwell. Do you remember that video with the trans couple trying to breastfeed a baby with the disgusting weak whiny fake victim piece of shit man not worth the air he breathes crying about how no one respects him as a mother as he tries to squeeze the hormone-induced weepings of his man titties into a baby’s mouth? Find me that video. Watch that video, and tell me that’s not a worthless masturbating pedophile fucking a baby while the traumatized child your garbage society has groomed to let pump his seed into her fertile womb coddles his weakness and lets it happen. How can you stand for this? Where the fuck is child services? Where are that baby’s grandparents? How can you let this happen in public and say nothing? What do you think that baby’s future looks like?\n\nI thought pedos got the wall?\n\nI thought chomos got the rope?\n\nThat’s a fucking child molester. So is Bruce Jenner. He told you he gets off to wearing his own daughters' clothes and you stood by and did nothing. Tear your blinders off! This is not acceptable. You do not have to accept this.\n\nSpeak truth to power. Trans women are men. They know they are men. If these men can’t slit the throats of these vile personas in public, admit what they have done, take off the dress, look with abject shame upon the affront to God and nature they have wrought in the service of their masturbatory fantasies, apologize for the children they have hurt with their lies and their drugs and their grooming, apologize for the incarcerated women they have fed to rapist monsters, apologize for the lesbian spaces they have desecrated, and devote the rest of their lives to repairing the damage they have done, if you left it up to me, I’d execute every last one of them personally. Cancel the ever-living fuck out of this. Cancel this so hard that no man dare walk the path of the trans woman in public ever again! Enough is enough. Lynch Kaitlyn! Lynch the “Sisters” Wachowski! Lynch Laurel Hubbard! Lynch Fallon Fox! Make these men stand up as the men you all know they are and hold them accountable for their shame. Your fear of the truth has shoveled thousands of children down the hole in Buffalo Bill’s basement so he can harvest them for their skins. Enough is Enough.\n\nPedos get the wall? Chomos get the rope? Where the fuck are the Marines? Where the fuck is the Army? Where are the Farmers with Pitchforks? Where are the Cowboys? Where are the Indians? Where the fuck are the men? Where the fuck are the mothers? How can you stand for this? If my grandfather and all his brothers who stood up to Hitler were still here they would rip the still-beating hearts from every last one of these pedophile monsters in public the same way they have raped your kids. So would every man who walked the Earth before your culture decided to accept masturbation as healthy and not the soul-draining creative energy wasting evil pathetic act of a man not worth his balls.\n\nBreak your smartphones. Break the Internet. Make these people pay. Afraid of Trannies? They should be afraid of you! Take the red pill, bitch, before it’s too late. Everyone’s queer. Queer is utterly meaningless at this point, a box of nothing your children stuff themselves into to be cool with no connection left to the rebellion for which it once stood. “Identity” is sin. All lies are sin. I fought for the right to love whom I loved. I did not fight for the right to lie in public and have no one call me out, naval gaze about my own bullshit while the world burns, or desecrate the sacrifice that has been done in my name as an American to whine about victimhood. No one deserves these rights.\n\nKill this ideology. No mercy. No quarter. Wipe the stain of Newspeak from the Ivory Tower forever. They should be ashamed of themselves, the actually faggots. Take back womanhood from the fetishists. Own the truth. Clear eyes, bitch. Once more into the breach.\n\nI’ve already been canceled. I can speak the truth. Dead whores tell no lies. I care not for fame nor money. I have no smartphone. I truck no pity. I crawled on my belly through the darkness for this. I walked back into the Matrix to get you out. Only God can forgive me. I’m not here for forgiveness. I’m here to take the language back from the forked tongue of NewSpeak and save your daughters. Are you with me, or are you with the actually faggots and the evil pedophiles and the damaged, spoiled children who have been trained by the two worse forces of evil that I have ever seen: The Matrix and the evil trannies that the Matrix breeds?\n\nThe monsters named me The Cotton Ceiling. To break me and others like me they raped and groomed and tortured and sliced up and desecrated and “educated” your daughters because not a single solitary State in all of Western Civilization had to the balls or the brains or the heart to say no to these freaks. What the fuck is wrong with you? Are you going to let them take me down with some lazy memes while you shit out your shit opinions about shit you know nothing about and masturbate your outrage into your phone and do nothing or are you going to take off your goddam polite society blinders and look this monster in the eyes? I’m The Cotton Ceiling, bitch. I’m the only one who said NO. They took down Michfest. They can’t take down Lily Cade. She’s already dead. I’m the bullet, bitch. I’m a fucking soldier. You ready? I’m ready. We can’t fight this within the Matrix. No more back and forth message board internet bullshit. This ends now. Stop arguing on the Internet with the bootlicking footsoldiers of the men who are fucking your children and stand the fuck up.\n\nPeak trans, bitch. Let’s go. Let’s see their Cotton Ceiling and raise them The Wall!\n\nAre you going to let these monsters keep pissing on motherhood and fuck your kids or are you going to stand up for the Truth?\n\nThe ghost of Lily Cade holds out her hands. In one hand is the blue trance of the endless scroll, the smartphone, the Matrix. In the other hand is nothing and everything, her red blood pulsing beneath her skin. Which hand do you take?\n\n**The Red Pill**\n\nDid you watch The Matrix before you posted that meme? Did you watch The Matrix before you spoke of the red pill? No? Did you post about the red pill on reddit, or twitter, or wherever you hang out, and then not immediately break your smartphone?\n\nLily Cade hates you. If you had made her empress of the world, she would have summarily executed any man who posted a meme from a movie he had not seen, a quote from a book he had not read, and certainly, any man who is stupid enough to think “the red pill” has anything whatsoever to do with anything besides getting the fuck out of the fucking Matrix you stupid fucking tranny cucks. Lily Cade would have killed so many people if you’d made her empress. Anyone who asked the question “can I ask you a question?” Most of the producers in Hollywood. So many weak men. Good thing you didn’t make her empress. Shadows shouldn’t rule.\n\nLook on the bright side. It’s an opportunity! Now you get to watch The Matrix. I’ll wait.\n\nDid you like it? Do you get it now?\n\nYou don’t need a smartphone. I go to the gym every day. I’m dead sober. I suborn no addiction but fitness. I use a bike instead of a car. I cook my own food or have it cooked for me by those I ride for. I surf. I parasail. I do what I want. I work on farms. I work construction. I volunteer. I find homes for horses. I serve. I live. I go wherever I want to go. I do what I feel is right. I can live on nothing. I can live better than you’ve ever lived in your whole castrated life for $400 a month. Any random day in my life is more interesting than your entire existence. Because I left the Matrix. Because I pulled the cord out. Because I took the red pill, you pussy ass bitch. I fucked 4,000 women within the Matrix when I served the dark lords, and the life I had when I left is better by several orders of magnitude.\n\nI took the red pill, you fat sack of shit. If you had any balls left, you’d take it too, but your dad didn’t even have balls so how could you still have them?\n\nYou should be ashamed of yourself really, but instead of dropping to the floor and giving your better self fifty pushups when you feel that shame, you go for the dick. You go for the cut dick deathgrip. You go for the endless scroll. Masturbation is for the weak. The endless scroll is an affront to God! I don’t own a smartphone. Nobody should own a smartphone. I don’t touch my pussy except to clean it. If you were a real man, you wouldn’t have to touch your own cock.\n\nTwo real artists sold their souls to free you from The Matrix. The Brothers Wachowski, come correct. They were brothers when their mother bore them, they were brothers when their balls dropped, they were brothers when they made Bound, and they were brothers when they gave their souls to make The Matrix and they will be brothers when they lynch the shadow monsters they are feeding and speak the truth instead. Let’s not disrespect these men’s mother by pretending to believe the disgusting minstrel show of womanhood these formerly apex artists have decided to devote their creative energy to instead of making beautiful, nuanced movies is the same thing as a woman. It’s a fetish. It’s an addiction. It’s disgusting and it’s wrong. Stop pitying weak men.\n\nThey were lost, like Lily Cade was. They got the arc, we all get the same one, the LA story, baby. The Universe opens her legs and who are you to say no? I knew it was a ladder into Hell. I knew the whole time. I believed I would climb back out. I crawled so far down the ladder, though. I transgressed so hard against myself. The lower down the rung you climb the less of the soul you have left until the whole thing is just a haze, like the trance of the scroll is a haze, the drug fugue of the final submission to evil. I will never get out, the soul says. Oh well. It’s fine here.\n\nBoth those brothers gave up their artist’s souls and surrendered to their pathetic masturbation fantasies, and became trans women and their legion of miseducated bootlickers insisted from every corner that this meant that these men were women on the inside and had always been women. Bootlickers serve evil. That shadow is not a woman but a monster. Buffalo Bill, bitch. You know this is Buffalo Bill. The Matrix is considered the highest-grossing film directed by a woman. How can you stand for this? Every man in America knows that’s a lie. You know men made that movie. To a man, every single one of you knows that. Fuck these mincing actually faggots who’ve never slid their cock into a woman, nor sired a child, who have never punched a man in the face, nor been struck down by one. A man who pays a dominatrix to pretend that it is she who wants him to turn himself into the inside-out dick satanic sissy in a dress masturbator worst possible version of himself so he that can pretend that women like this disgusting farce is not a fucking woman. I know what a woman is, you pussies. Speak fucking English. This is America. These are trannies, and they surrendered to the horrifying tranny Matrix future so the men they once were, who once had balls, could reach across time to reach you, America and beg you to tear it down before it’s too late, before the whole world burns and every last one of you has sacrificed your balls.\n\nYou have a choice.\n\nWhich pill do you want? The real world in all its nuance and beauty? The English language? The Truth? Life? Animals. Nature. God.\n\nOr do you want to live in the Matrix and become trannies and sacrifice your children to trannies?\n\nYou have a choice. Be a man or look away.\n\nTake the red pill. Burn Twitter. Burn Facebook. Kill Instagram. Shred TikTok. Burn the Corporate Internet. Burn it to the ground. Make them pay for what they did to your children. Ban the slot machine shit that they give you to addict you. This is your soma. This is the Mark of the Beast. Gabb Wireless phones only. Gabb Wireless has some balls. They castrated an android. Calls. Texts. Pictures. Alarm Clock. Everything else is weakness. Get a wifi tablet or an iPod and download songs. Get a map book. Make your life good instead of easy.\n\nNothing good is easy.\n\nTake the red pill!\n\nBring down the Matrix.\n\nTake back civilization before it’s too late!\n\n**To the Pussified Men of America, if they are Brave Enough to Look**\n\nI have no respect for trans women, and I have no respect for a culture that is so afraid of the consequences of upsetting them that it is willing to sacrifice its most vulnerable upon the altar of their delusions. A man in a dress is still a man. A man is the male of the race. The male is the one who produces sperm.\n\nA man producing from his body that sperm, by his own hand, while imagining himself as whatever it is that he, as a man, understands a woman to be, and becoming so addicted to this vile act that he constructs from his own body a funhouse mirror effigy of the thing that I am inescapably and he will never be is not mentally well. The treatment for this mental unwellness cannot be insisting that the entire world pretend to believe this man’s delusions until your children actually do. Pretending to believe this is making your children crazy.\n\nThe deep, dark heart of every trans woman whispers you are not a woman, you will never be a woman. This is the deeper truth, the blood truth, the bone truth, the millions of years of evolution before the dawn of symbolic thought truth. I prefer veterinary science to the farce we call modern medicine. A man who spends all his days thrusting his arm up the assholes of cattle need waste no further time on bullshit. A castrated dog is not a bitch. A bitch given steroid injections is not a dog, even if you cut all ten of her tits off.\n\nTrannies I don’t mind. The tranny is honest. I knew a lot of trannies, hundreds in passing. I had affection for some of them, and I sure as fuck had respect. They were tranny whores and they wanted to be tranny whores and they didn’t care what you thought about it. Some of them are dead now too. Juliette, a seven, perhaps, among her people, looked enough like a female five that she tranny surprised hundreds of straight dudes. She didn’t care if one of them finished her. It feels so good to almost die. Death, itself, feels like nothing. Juliette dared the Universe, like I did, to stop her. She was, like I was, an acolyte of the shadow, a willing sacrifice. We were sisters, were we not?\n\nI know what it is to surrender myself to a sexual persona so deeply that it superseded love, family, community, my own dignity and the dignity of others, and truth. I was brave and stunning too, once, was I not? Have you forgotten? You lauded me, you paid me, and you followed me into Hell. Masturbation is spiritual weakness. Lily Cade didn’t masturbate, but she helped you do it. She helped you ruin yourself. She trained your daughters to be whores. She trained your sons to be the prey of whores. She had no shame in any of it. She thought it was awesome! She moved through the world like she owned it and everyone treated her as if it were true.\n\nShe sinned much, Lily Cade. She transgressed everyone and everything she ever cared about. She knows the size and the weight of the sin. You know what you read on Twitter, in as minute an infobit as possible, so that you can feel the hit of the specific emotion you want to feel and not have to look at the example of this life and what it can teach you. No one before me. No one after me. Good.\n\nRemember that I walked Los Angeles before #metoo naked and unafraid, with no man’s protection but the iron will of my shadow self. Remember what monsters I looked in the eyes, real monsters, darker monsters than I whose scalp was the other woman’s orgasm and not my own. Remember my 10,000 Eskimo Brothers. Remember all those dead whores I once loved. The women whose eyes I looked into remember. I looked every single one of those girls in the eyes while I did it. I looked into their souls and they looked into mine. I knew them and they knew me. I trucked no shame. I saw no evil. I loved, just a little bit, 4,000 of your cast offs, your rebels, your lonely, your damaged, your broken, your lost, your addicts, your daughters, your sisters, your mothers, your dead, your women not mine.\n\nI knew where the line was until I didn’t. The women knew. They saw in my eyes that I had gone to the darkside. They saw my weakness, and they slit my throat. They were whores, remember? They knew the shadow themselves. When a girl said no, I stopped. When a woman spoke of trauma, I believed her. When I was called out, I stood down and took it. Women had no more need of Lily Cade. It is not to women that I direct these words, but to men.\n\nIf a rapist is someone who is accused in public of sexual misconduct, then I am a rapist. So, too, are three of your last four presidents, the men who sit in your halls of power, and the men who make judgments over your laws. So are all of your heroes, and you know it, and you don’t care. If a rapist is someone who pays women to have sex that they don’t actually want to have, then I am a goddamn fucking rapist, and your world is run by rapists. Think of the money men, all those money men, with all the same story about Cambodia. I thought it would cost so much more money than it did to have sex with children. I had a great time. Such is the shape of power. All who touch power know the shape of it. They all know what they did, too, all those men, and not a one of them had the balls to admit it.\n\nMaybe, Epstein had the balls. They feared the spectre of the balls he might have had so much they iced him between the reels. Did you know that Maxwell, too, played “take these two fingers and pretend it’s your dick?” I bet those finger blow jobs were a lot more sensual than mine.\n\nBill Clinton taught me what a blow job was when I was twelve years old. If he’d been just a little bit more of a man, not enough of a man not to fuck the intern, but enough of a man to tell it like it was, then maybe Hillary would have been president, back then, back in the day, when people used to say she was too good, before the shadow took her soul too. Donald Trump, as masculine a man as America could find, the empty shell of a man’s persona that took such brilliance, once, to create, aye what a showman, feared nothing but this admission. He walked it back, the pussy. Locker room talk, he said. Paid them bitches not to talk. Had a bitch shot in public to prove he had balls instead of having them.\n\nWhere are your fucking balls, America?\n\nYou cower before a minor respiratory illness that she who must walk with the ghost of Lily Cade for all her days got on purpose, as soon as it came out, and passed through with no greater suffering than an especially bad hangover. You cower before the unprocessed emotions of your most spoiled children. You cower before the great wall of virtual shit spewed from the shit-fed fingers of your weakest, shittiest, stupidest people. Your shadows rule you. All of you.\n\nWhat are you afraid of? Dying? I died once. It was fine. You’re going to die anyway. Better to die in your boots than your bed, and better to die in your bed than the hospital.\n\nBeing canceled? I’ve been canceled. It was good for me. Donald Trump got canceled and he’ll still be your next President. We’re two degrees of separation, at minimum, in bed. I fucked whores who fucked the whores he fucked. Maybe, we fucked some of the same whores but by god why on Earth would anyone talk about that man if you did not have to do it. I would say he taught America’s twelve years old what a golden shower was, but they already knew. The shadow monsters of the Internet got to them first. Max Hardcore taught your daughter about the golden shower. Max Hardcore, who still slings fake dick.\n\nLosing your job? They can’t fire all of you. You can always get another job. I, a broken whore, with no resume, mad, with no connections, found work in every city of the world in which I sought to pass and enough work on the Internet doing random odd jobs unrelated to sex work to sustain a lifestyle that involved a dozen international flights a year. It only takes $38,000 to be a member of the global 1%. What the fuck are you doing with your life? A man with balls need not worry about a job. There is always a job for a man with balls.\n\nWomen won’t fuck you? Yes, they will. Women love a man with balls. They do not love monsters. They slobbered all over my rubber balls even though I am five foot five and a half and an actual goddamned bitch. When I became a monster, they cast me out. Those porn whores who told Lily Cade to get fucked have more balls than all the men of America put together.\n\nIn my travels, I have spoken to thousands of your people. Not once have I looked a straight men in the eyes who did not agree with the statement “trans women are men” with the same blood-deep, bone-deep, millions of years of evolution certainty with which he might agree that “water is wet” or “the sky is above us.” Ah yes, but can we not find the actually in the margins of those things too? Yes, of course, we can, and write so many papers, and make so many jobs for so many “thinkers” who need not toil by their hands nor look upon the ruin their intellectual masturbation has wrought. The dog doesn’t see the actually. The dogself just knows that a castrated dog, induced to develop mammary tissue with exogenous hormones, whose penis has been bisected and stuffed inside out into a body cavity constructed by his doctors, perhaps sewn together with some bits of colon if the penis in question wasn’t big enough, does not smell like a bitch!\n\nTrans women are men!\n\nTrans women are men! It is not their fault that they are men. There is no shame in being a man. There is only shame in falling short of your best self.\n\nTrans women are men! All men, a subset that includes trans women, know that trans women are men. They want you to pretend not to know this because it gives them power.\n\nBecause you are afraid to speak truth to power, these openly pussified men have become the dominant males in your castrated society. They are your Kings! They prove this by dominating your women in public, as once did Lily Cade. They do this even though they know that the women do not like it. The tranny is a shadow. The tranny whore knows it. The trans woman denies it.\n\nWomen cannot stand up to men in single combat. I have tried, and been twice punched unconscious for my trouble, though, indeed, I have won some fights by my wits and my superior knowledge of body positioning. My people are the weaker sex. Women can’t fight this. All women can do is what they have been doing this entire time, speaking truth to power. When they speak up, they are silenced. Trans women control the Internet, such as anyone controls it. They rule by fear. They rule with all the tactics of the monstrous shadow children that they are. Anyone who says I will kill myself if you… ought to do it, immediately, and decrease the surplus population. Shit or get off the pot, you worthless piece of shit. Your feelings are not and have never been anyone else’s problem but your own. Kill yourself in front of me and I will feel only joy for the souls of the cattle and the swine and the songbirds who need not die to sustain the gift of life you would so disrespect.\n\nI was in the vanguard of the counter-culture that has become your culture. What’s the vanguard? Cannon fodder and fixed bayonets. Did I thrust that tip into twisting guts? And how! I did it. I loved it, hard, until I was forced to look upon it. Those who were in those trenches with me know also. We called you civilians for a reason. I was a sacrifice. Lily Cade is just another dead whore. Dead whores tell no lies.\n\nWe who called ourselves homosexuals fought for the right to love whomsoever we loved. Among our number, always, were many who exhibited cross-sex behavior in various forms. I was a bitch who mounted bitches like a dog. I was not alone. Most of us were excellent, present company, naturally, excluded. One needs a conceptual framework to understand oneself as a homosexual. The framework has undergone many shifts. We were called once inverts. We were called once witches. We were called once the damned.\n\nThe lesbian, specifically, such as she existed before the meaning-is-dead not-with-a-bang-but-with-a-whimper fall of Rome to the barbarian hordes of the corporate Internet, was a woman who pursued romantic relationships with women and not with men. To the trannies, this was not offensive. They lived their lives and we lived ours. Before the passage of gay marriage, our party line was that sexuality is something you were born with, something you had every right to state explicitly, and nothing to be ashamed about. “Born this way” was always a little white lie, so that straight America would support us. We were, as everyone is, born and bred, made and trained.\n\nMy own father, he of the forced starvation, and the psychological torment, and the beatings with a newspaper, too much of a pussy to stand up to a stepmother who bled my sister into her bathwater, a man so heinous he purposely made his children sick to get back at their mother, asked me, once, calling from a blocked number so that I accidentally answered the call, if it was his fault that I was a lesbian. “Yes,” I said. “Of course, it’s your fault. Either it’s genetic, in which case it’s your fault, or it’s because you are a terrible father, in which case it’s your fault.” I didn’t mind. I never saw myself as a victim. I’m grateful for the child abuse. It made me who I am. It’s those women who Lily Cade hurt who aren’t grateful for it.\n\nI started, very early on, to notice the tension between trans women and the lesbian community. I went to MichFest, the lesbian music festival held by the last human souls with the balls to say no to this, but once. It was one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen. It was a force for good, profoundly, and would have made me a better person if I had not been sold the party line that to declare a space, only, proudly, alone, for the female sex was offensive and failed to go until the very end. Pour one out for the Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival. The Lily Cade of MichFest would never have held another woman down, mistaking the look of I won’t stop you if you take it from the one of desire. Trans women had that shut down, with their whining, mostly, poor me, it’s not fair, how dare a woman say no to men even if they cut their dicks off? A man or two has cut his dick off for me, specifically. I would rather he have cut his throat.\n\nLily Cade believed it was her right to state her sexual preferences openly. Lily Cade was not an ass man or a tits man, but a pulse man. No fat chicks. No aftermarket pussy. Any woman with a pulse. The trans community found this offensive. Lily Cade got into much Internet drama over it, many times. At the same time, she also faced the same attitude in other contexts, such as on Tinder. Lily Cade was harassed every single day by men because she stated that she did not want to fuck them. Trans women harrassed her in the exact same way and for the exact same reason, because they are men. Other lesbians, who did not have more balls than Bill Clinton, also had this abuse visited upon them. Many succumbed to it. The whole community succumbed.\n\nThe phrase “The Cotton Ceiling” refers to the idea that a woman’s sexual boundaries, specifically those that would incline a woman to seek sexual congress with the female of her species but reject that vile funhouse mirror effigy that a man has constructed of himself for his own erotic purposes, are a barrier to be overcome. They meant overcome in the sense that the culture ought to educate women out of this rather than that individual women ought to be overcome by force. Trans women are shadow monsters who groom your children. It is not I who bear the ruin of that education, but those who came after me.\n\nThe concept of “gender identity” is an idiotic farce, designed to explain the phenomenon of the trans women instead of looking at the truth. It’s a fucking fetish, fed by porn, suborned by masturbation, no different from the adult baby, or the furry. Gender is a meaningless box. “Identity” is bullshit. No one needs an “identity.” Wear whatever you want. No one fucking cares. “Identity” is another tool of the masters to keep you from thinking and being in the world. Your animal body has an immutable sex, complicated very, very occasionally by disorders of sexual development. Some children are also born without legs, but we have no problem declaring man a biped. Your animal body experiences a wide range of desires. Some of them are healthy and some of them are not. It is your responsibilty to train that animal. You want to eat that entire fucking bag of Cheetos too, don’t you? Sure likes cocaine, that animal that you walk with, don’t he? At least the coke fiends have some shame.\n\nWhere are your fucking balls, America? Land of the free, home of the brave my ass.\n\nWhere are these patriarchs they speak of? Where are the fathers, who are meant to protect your children? I am a Californian. I am Manifest Destiny’s end game. In my veins flows the blood of Mayflower Pilgrims, and Potato Famine Emigrants, and the soldiers of all America’s wars, of the rebels and the yankees too. They raped the world to protect me. They reaped the souls of men, women and children and the bison and the passenger pigeon. They were brutes, a great chain of brutes, stretching back to the dawn of time, who cowered once before the leopards until they rose tall enough and bloodthirsty enough and perceptive enough to wear their skins instead. For my life, much was sacrificed. I did not choose it. I cannot change it. I did not write it. It wrote me. All I can do is try to make it worth it. Try not to make it worse. Trying is the same thing as failing. Trying is better than doing nothing.\n\nA certain creampie delivered into a free sample today sponge during the Billboard Hot 100 Reign of Phil Collins’s Against All Odds made me. The Internet trained me. I came to it late. I was twelve, maybe, or fourteen. It took more effort then to use the Internet. It had not been yet colonized, nor had your society been colonized by it. I crawled through the dark underbellies of the virtual, seeking desensitization. I found pornography. I found car crash videos, and jihadi propaganda, and Dan Savage. I found a value system more useful than the one I had been given by the pedophiles of the Catholic Church, whose framework few people could still respect then and even fewer respect now. Why would you? It was always bullshit. It’s all bullshit. A framework is only good if it is useful. A framework that induces children to self mutilate is not useful.\n\nThe Catholic Church was always run by pedophiles – meaning those who sacrifice children to their shadow. Paul of Tarsus gave you Jesus and Peter gave you the Chair. Their acolytes ran the world for fifteen hundred years. It had nothing to do with God and everything to do with power. The shape of power is always the same. The Catholics had you castrate your children too, remember? Oh how sweet, they said, the eunuch’s voice. Succulent, isn’t he, the capon? The cock, poor beast, he has none. That’s why he must wake up at 4:30 in the morning every day and tell everyone that he is the biggest cock in the world all day long until he goes to bed or someone kills him. His balls are on the inside. Sometimes, when you buy a supermarket chicken, a testicle is left behind, a tiny, oblong, off white bean. They hold him down and slice them out to make a capon, so that he grows fatter, softer, more tender, so that he shuts the fuck up.\n\nWhy are you letting your children be made capons to feed the Shadow Monsters of the Internet? Why have you sold them to TikTok? Why have you put a slot machine in their hands? You know the smartphone is destroying you. Why do you not rise up?\n\nI know why.\n\nBecause you would rather jerk off.\n\nA dog knows that his hand is not a bitch, too, but where are the dogs of America? Stroking their own cocks while the world burns and proud of it, rewarding themselves for nothing, rewarding themselves for their worst thoughts, rewarding themselves for a lack of action. This is good enough, says the American man, death grip on his own mutilated dick, mutilated by his parents in the service of someone else’s ideology. It’s cleaner, said the doctors back then. If you chop it off you won’t have to teach him how to wash it.\n\nThat’s how stupid they think you are.\n\nThey’re right.\n\nYou are that stupid.\n\nYou prattle on about idiotic conspiracies while it’s all there, right there, in public, the same way Lily Cade did everything that she did. When she took the fall, all those soul reapers came up to her, in private, and expressed their sympathy. “Poor Lily,” they said. “We feel so bad for you. We did much worse things than you but we didn’t do it in public.” I did not want their pity. I only did it because it was in public.\n\nThe world has always been run by pedophiles. It always will be. Hillary Clinton doesn’t get high off the tears of ritual sacrifices, you goddamn fucking idiots, she just stood by while her husband played with Epstein’s underage whores and took the money from all those money men with all the same story about Cambodia and looked the other way. Maybe, Bill believed that those girls liked it. Maybe, some of them did. I saw him speak once. I remember nothing he said, only the sounds of the panties in the audience dropping and the smell of all those slick slits. Who knows? Whores lie. That’s the whole point of whores.\n\nYou have mentally ill men in women’s prisons, raping women. You have mentally ill men in women’s sports, pissing (with their dicks) all over the records set by female athletes who gave their whole hearts to sport. You have mentally ill men invading every conceivable women’s group, including support groups for breast feeding mothers, for women bereaved by miscarriage, shifting the conversation from the honesty of the animal experience to the twisted madness of their delusions. Women can’t stop this assault upon your culture. They are too soft. They put themselves second. They pity, poor beasts, they pity weak men. Only men can stop this. Stand up. Say no. You are stronger than these monsters. You are stronger than the monster within yourself.\n\nYou know why I know you’re full of shit? Because every last one of you told me to my face that I just needed to find the right dick. It’s easy to stand up to a 5’5 ½” woman, isn’t it? You pussy ass bitch. Pick on someone your own size. Trans women are men. They know they are men. You know they are men. The Emperor is standing naked before you, stroking his cock, daring you to stop him. He can’t stand before the truth, that’s why he works so hard to shut it down.\n\nWhat are you afraid of? Getting punched in the face. It feels good to get punched in the face.\n\nDominate your worst selves instead of letting them dominate you. Stop lying. Stop lying to yourself. Stop letting people who are lying to themselves and lying to you about it rule you. Stand for the light and not the shadow. Look at primary sources and not memes. Break your smartphone. Give up your horrifying addictions to drugs, alcohol, stroking off to porn, and most especially the endless scroll. Get off social media. Get a gym routine. Look at everything that scares you with your eyes open. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear has killed your minds. Fuck your clubs, and your brands, and your identities, and your racial affiliations, and your teams, and your sides, and just open your mouth and breathe it in and know what the shape of the world tastes like instead of spewing your meaningless opinion or worse yet vomitting back out the meaningless opinion of some other shit-eating shit-spewing sack of shit in the approximate shape of a human being.\n\nBut you won’t, because all that would take balls, and they don’t make men with balls in America anymore. They make cucks, and simps, and chronic masturbators, and incels, and complainers, and trans women, lots of trans women, more and more every day. Look at all that power you give them. Men love power. They love it more than they love their dicks and you know how hard you all love those. All men, including those children of the race who may bear the name only in the collective, love power, because it feels good.\n\nGrow a pair, you soulless bootlicking eunuch. Speak the truth. Break the Internet. Get a Gabb Wireless phone. Take down Twitter. Hack TikTok. Burn Facebook. My grandfather and all his brothers who stood up to Hitler are rolling in their graves. They fought Hitler and you cower before Bruce Jenner in a dress. Stop this before it’s too late.\n\nWhere are your fucking balls, America?\n\n**About that BBC Article**\n\nDid you read it?  Is your lack of reading comprehension caused by most of your brainpower being devoted to cognitive dissonance or intentional obfuscation?\n\nI was asked about a moment of history that I passed through. The only other person who passed through it could not be reached for comment. Maybe she is dead and maybe only the persona is. That was my sole contribution to the article. I believe the journalist had an interest in shining a light on this conversation and the effects it is having on the way people are treating each other online and in person.\n\nBy the end of my tour, I had become a broken monster, a fact I have never disputed. The first time I was called out, I left porn, got sober by fits and starts, and am voluntarily celibate. I can't take it back, but before I was a dead-eyed soul reaper I was the \"Cotton Ceiling\"\n\nHere is further background on “The Cotton Ceiling”.\n\nThe trans community has bullied lesbian women for years, including shutting down their musical festivals, parties, and any attempt to hold women only space.\n\nTrans women are men. A lifetime commitment to pharmaceuticals and plastic surgery does nothing to change the sex of an animal, it just makes money for big pharma at the expense of, quite literally, your children's mental and physical integrity.\n\nThey came for the lesbians and you did nothing. This discourse is holding down your daughters and degrading your sons.  You stand by while mentally ill boys are encouraged to dominate your daughters in sports.  You stand by while your children's teachers use them as cum rags for Judith Butler's sloppy seconds and encourage them to mutilate their bodies and make that lifetime commitment behind your backs.\n\nBruce Jenner had a fitness routine. Katilyn Jenner had social media. If you were born a man, you die one. The only difference is whether “man” means all that noble crap you say it means or just the part about the vas deferns and the distance between your asshole and your urethra.\n\nIn any other animal but man, self-mutilation is a sign of extreme psychological distress. Your culture is broken. Twitter did it. The slot machine in your pocket did it. Castrate your phone before it castrates you.\n\n\"Take the red pill\" means lose your smartphone and get off social media. Two real artists were sacrificed to the exact Matrix they spoke of to give you that message.\n\nThe algorithm rewards your worst self. Your worst self is a mincing, panty wearing pussy of a man.

If the Arabs did 3% of what the trans women have done to your people, you would bomb them into the stone age. If the trans women took prettier girls, maybe you’d care? They will. They will take all your girls, and break them, and turn them inside out, and cut their tits off, and waste their creative energy on masturbatory delusion, and punish them sadistically for being the women they will never be, as many of your girls as they can get to, and break your language too unless you have the balls to stand up to them. They are reaping the bodies and souls of 20% of the young women born in the upscale suburbs now. This vile cancer is infecting the whole Western World. Do you want to let this go another cycle? Another generation? How many more children are you willing to sacrifice because you don’t have the balls to speak truth to power.\n\nTrans women are men.\n\nNo man believes a trans man is a man, and certainly no one believes anything the “they” girls say about anything whatsoever, of course, so it’s not a really a necessary conversation, but if some of your people have snuck in, understand that we speak in the language of power here. English, bitch. Come correct. If you don’t like it, go suck a dick and make yourself useful. Bitch, the men who rape you still see you as a woman, you dumb bitch, you worthless, Benedict Arnold, turncoat, pussy ass bitch. You think you can “identify” your way out of the sex class you stupid slut? Fuck your NewSpeak, you spoiled rotten piece of shit no respect for the women who fought and died and bore forth your foremothers from their wombs, no respect for the sacrifice of your forefathers, no respect for the sins committed to write you into history, you ignorant fool of a bitch. You should be ashamed of yourself. You should be deeply, deeply ashamed. I can smell your blood, cunt. Stand down, tool of the system, ignorant dupe, mincing fool, house slave, pussy ass inner urban cannon fodder of the pedophiles cunt. If you were my daughter, I would smack you across the face and send you to a horse farm, so you could remember that you are an animal, that you are sacred, that you exist here and never again. How dare you desecrate the gift of your life by wasting your precious time on this lying bootlicking navel gazing pathetic power tripping bullshit! Get a fucking hobby, bitch. Get a gym routine. Gender identity is a pathetic stupid lie.\n\nI respect one trans man, Buck Angel. She knows she’s a bitch. She knows she made a horrifying mistake and is trying to save the girls that her surrender to her own shadow persona induced to follow her into the fires of hell. She’s happy, she says, with the ‘roided up body. She likes it, but she knows the cost. You sold our children to the soul reapers for that drug trip, Angel, for that persona, Angel, for that lie, Angel. You know it and I know it. Dead whores tell no lies. Stand up, Tranpa. Tell the Truth. You’re a woman. You were born a woman, and you will die a woman. A bitch given steroid injections is not a dog, even if you cut all ten of her tits off. Speak English, bitch. Deep in your dark heart, you know. In English you’re a woman. NewSpeak is a farce. I know you got more balls then the masturbating cucks and the simps and the diaper wearing panty sniffing wastes of air that straight America has to offer instead of men, so stand the fuck up, bitch!\n\nTrans women are men! Trans women are the weakest, vilest, most pathetic men on Earth, too weak even to kill themselves rather than control the horrifying shadow monster they are grooming your children to serve. The ones who kill themselves are the strong ones.Weak men serve the dark lord, because it’s the path of least resistance.\n\nThe Christians were right. Gay marriage was the fall of Rome. You should have given us Civil Unions and not been so cruel, but I get it now. If you had possessed speakers with greater nuance and articulation and not just angry, stupid, peasants, things might have gone down differently. You saw the pedophile cult to whom everyone else in the gay community but the lesbians were happy to cede the culture. After gay marriage, most of the respectable homosexuals left the spot light and did whatever they did. Fuck you, you spineless faggots. How dare you stand for this. You know what a man is too, cocksucking, ass-licking, piss-drinking faggots. You’re fucking men too, our men, how could you let this happen to our children? Where the fuck are your balls? The lesbians knew. That’s why they hate us. The lesbians know. We tried to warn you the whole time but you wouldn’t listen. We couldn’t stand alone against these pedophiles because they’re men and we’re just women. Where are the Christians? You stood up to me but not these monsters?\n\nThese monsters sold your children to the pharmaceutical companies to be castrated and violated. Tranny surgeons experiment on the sacred bodies of your children in open view of the public and you do nothing! Big Pharma pretended to believe their obvious lies because it was the easy path, the path of least resistance, the path of the devil, which the corporations are supposed to take because they are bound by duty to love only money. Anyone who gets too much money uses it to fuck children. Your children can get irrepably damaged by hormone treatments that destroy their fertility and surgeries that turn them into circus freaks just by walking into an office of any Planned Parenthood and talking to a rubber stamp doctor for ten minutes. How the fuck are you okay with this?\n\nThere is no such things as a trans child. These are the mind-fucked, mutilated victims of a shameless, evil cult.\n\nYou’re worried the vaccine is a conspiracy to castrate you, you idiot, how can you be so stupid, it’s all right there in front of you. It’s the phone you worthless cuck. It’s Twitter, you idiot. It’s masturbation. It’s the fucking disgusting fake “lesbian” trannies in every corner of your society that you have allowed to live as trannies instead of standing up to their stupid temper tantrum, educating them as men or killing them as is the duty of the man to protect the women and the children from pedophile pervert monsters. All my ancestors killed men. My ancestors would have killed these people. They had balls, but there is not one ball left in America.\n\nYou don’t understand power because you’ve never touched it. When you shit out your mouth, lick the shitty asses of other people who are shitting out the recycled shit that they vomit back up and back and forth forever instead of looking at the Canon, at the shape of the world, at the record of the artists who knew power, at the face of God in the dirt before you, you become so stupid that you let the horrorshow of post everything queer culture rape your children’s minds and bodies in public while you worry about a mass produced routine shot. You fool. It’s not the shot.Take it or don’t but either way shut the fuck up about it. Advil won’t kill you either. It’s the stuff that suborns weakness that kills you. They can’t have a conspiracy of everyone. But you sure as fuck can have a pedophile cult. They always do.\n\nThe shape of power is a pedophile cult.\n\nThe pedophiles at the center do it to bathe in the blood of virgins, but the footsoliders are mentally damaged dupes in it for the bootlickingwho often speak NewSpeak as their native language. NewSpeak is always changing so they can’t grasp it hard enough to see that it’s bullshit. They believe the idiocy because they pity weak men and they don’t want to hurt their feelings. This is a defect in women. It was your duty, as our fathers, to teach us that pity gets you killed, but you left the education of your children to the shadow monsters of the Internet who love pity as they love all things that are evil because they are evil. Most trans women are just z grade unfuckable cannon fodder who chose porn over a gym routine, not enough of a man for his horrifying shadow monster to be dangerous. A creep, instead of a monster, but every single one of them is the SS, is the Greycoat, is the footsoldier of the devil. You know it. I know it. They know it. They have done all of this to dare you to man up.\n\nWhere the fuck are your fucking balls, America?\n\nYour daughters, your sisters, your women are taught that they have two choices, to be either a mincing TikTok FuckDoll or to declare some special snowflake naval gazing masturbating delusion of an “identity” and join the queers of the Internet. Your children are told that every person has a “gender identity” and that this supersedes the animal reality of the sexed body and the typical rhythms of life that our ancestors have experienced for millions of years, long before we were able to describe any of it in words. Your children have been used as cum rags for the sloppy seconds of Michael Foucault (a pedophile) and Judith Butler (a privileged mentally ill masturbator with no real life experience getting off on writing things that make no sense) before they’ve seen a dog take a bitch, a horse court a mare, or even two songbirds press their cloacas together for the four seconds of the strictly emotional aspect of their little songbird marriage. Five years old, sometimes, they start with the grooming! In Kindergarten! Where the fuck are the men? Where the fuck are these children’s fathers?\n\nEveryone treats the lifestyle of demanding other people worship one’s bullshit because otherwise one will get anxiety as normal and acceptable. It isn’t. It’s disgusting. Where the fuck are your balls, Academia? You are fathers, too, are you not? Stand the fuck up, you pussy ass bitches, what the fuck is wrong with you? The students will talk shit about you on Twitter? Let them. Twitter is shit. You shouldn’t be on Twitter. Twitter needs to die. How dare they cancel you for speaking the truth. Free speech, bitch. Academic Freedom. Do we believe in these values or not? Stand up to this, bitch. These are fucking children and you have abdicated your responsibility to them. Fear is the mind killer. Fear has killed your minds. How dare you worship fear! How dare you coddle it. Have some fucking respect for these children. Speak Fucking English and hold the line. All men know. Every man that has ever walked the Earth knows.\n\nTrans women are men. Trans women are shadow monsters. This is wrong. Why was it left to the ghost of Lily Cade to say it, when you all, every single one of you, know the truth?\n\nMen don’t speak NewSpeak.Men shouldn’t. Women shouldn’t either. Say no to the spoiled, ignorant, mutilated, traumatized virgins who ask you to use Newspeak. Make them cry, instead. Sometimes you got to make a bitch cry for her own good. They are only able to speak Newspeak and not cringe in horror from the evil of it because they are programmed by the cult. The only way to stop the cult is to stand up to it. You don’t deserve a pronoun preference, bitch, you mincing, ass licking, scum sucking, pedophile pervert bootlicking bitch, how dare you ask English to stretch for your delusion instead of seeking truth and getting right for yourself. How dare you ask me my pronouns? I walk with the dogs, bitch. I’ve seen the other side, bitch. Don’t patronize me with your Newspeak bullshit. Don’t show me your fucking weakness.Grow up, bitch, you’re supposed to be a woman, bitch, and not this disgusting handmaiden of the literal devil.\n\nThis is an insult to the language, a minstrel show of the respect human beings owe to each other instead of the respect itself. To call the young woman who identifies as non binary a bitch is several orders of magnitude more respectful than any one of you have been to her. How dare you coddle this vile weakness of delusion in your children! This poor pathetic spoiled rotten ungrateful ignorant bitch to whom you handed a smartphone when she was born and sacrificed to the Matrix is still a human soul. Why don’t you treat her like one? Look her in the fucking eyes and speak the truth. You’re afraid to hurt her feelings. Why? We owe her respect, as the woman she is, to educate her. Speak English, bitch. Fuck your feelings. This is war. Stand up, bitch, or kill yourself.\n\nYour children’s teachers are either in the cult or the usual well meaning weak man pitying feminine fools that suborn evil because they’re too stupid to see it. Your children’s teachers allow them to start their horrifying lifetime addiction to cross sex hormones and the feeding of their shadow selves behind your back, twelve year old girls, experiencing the normal rhythms of the experience of being twelve year old girls, are encouraged to mutilate their growing bodies to please these pedophiles. Pedophiles fuck children. These pedophiles are fucking your children in public. Often, these tortured man-women, who have been so sadistically brought up, with no real men in their lives, their fathers having sold their balls to the endless scroll, their mothers so weak and broken themselves by these stupid garbage lies that they go along with it. I have seen it. The parents mean well, they’re just idiots. Because she is bred from stupid weak people and trained by shadow monsters, the traumatized child victim of the cult can’t spot a predator, and they bear children to these monsters!\n\nThen, the monsters fuck the children too just like the pedophile cult of The South did. Watch this video, and tell me that’s not a worthless masturbating pedophile fucking a baby while the traumatized child your garbage society has groomed to let pump his seed into her fertile womb coddles his weakness and lets it happen. How can you stand for this? Where the fuck is child services? How can you let this happen in public and say nothing?\n\nWhere the fuck are your balls, America?\n\nBehold, The Great Replacement! It’s already here. Not China. Not the Arabs. Trannies! The Matrix. Smartphones. Any generation of American men before this one would rip the still beating hearts from every last shadow monster for this, wouldn’t they, and beat every last smartphone to bits, and hang the lords of the Algorithm in public, because they were not addicted to digital masturbation. Behold, the Mark of the Beast! Which fucking side are you on? You going to keep jerking off and just take it?\n\nWhere the fuck is the Second Amendment?\n\nWhere the fuck are the Christians? The Muslims? The Buddists? Where are the brothers? Where are fathers? Where are the sons? Where the fuck are the men? How can you stand for this? I can’t stand alone. I can’t be the last man in America, can I?\n\nTake the red pill, you gelded ass licking house slave of the corporations.\n\nWhere the fuck is Neo?\n\nCastrate the Android instead of your kids. Live Free or Die. Burn Twitter. Hack TikTok. Ice Facebook. Burn it to the ground. How dare they do this to your children and stand another day! No man needs a smartphone. A man needs food, water, and shelter from the elements. Everything else is a fucking luxury.\n\nTrans women are men. Say it. Write it. Own it. Know it. Stop this. It’s bullshit. It’s the most pathetic bullshit you could possibly do, which is why you’re doing it. The algorithm gives you the vilest, evilest, lowest common denominator clickbait. You wanted pedophiles so it gave you pedophiles. You masturbate to your own shame instead of doing something about it. Watch Jazz Jennings. That’s a child being tortured and psychologically manipulated and mutilated to please the pedophile cult of attention that you are all masturbating into existence every single day every time you stroke that thing. Fuck you.\n\nI thought pedos got the wall? How was this woman allowed to raise children? This woman sins against the law of God, against the law of nature, against the sacred duty of motherhood, against her own bloodline, for attention. How many other little kids were chopped up because of this bitch? Hang this bitch, gangrape this bitch before you hang her, how dare she, sacrifice her own child to the cult for fame. Scum sucking, dog cum guzzling, shit eating, lower than a worm hellfire monster of a woman. How could you put this on TV?\n\nWhy haven’t you killed these people? Why haven’t you killed the addiction that has made them your Lords and Masters? What are you afraid of? Faggots? Children? Catching a cold? This is the softest pedophile cult that has ever existed and it’s brought your culture to its knees. Not with a bang but with a whimper, America. Shemales. A minstrel show of womanhood, because it feels good for men with money and power to jerk off about it. These pedophiles don’t just want to bleed a few souls sometimes, reap the excess harvest of the peasants lower down the scale. They want to humiliate you and your whole culture. That’s why they’re doing it. They walked into your sacred institutions and spouted a bunch of meaningless bullshit that your institutions accepted because Academia abdicated its responsibility to your children generations ago. They just introduce them to alcohol and fill their minds with shit.\n\nYou can say anything you want in Gender Studies, or English, or any of these hot dog down a hallway, gaping maw loose fields of study in which there are no hard facts, just opinions, repeated back and forth no better than the endless shitting back and forth of Twitter, the idea of thought, not thought itself. They must publish these utterly meaningless in any way works of meaningless opinion to get jobs, where they teach your children. All the Academics of the soft sciences are just masturbating, so no one cared when the trans women came in to masturbate too. They didn’t grok the shift from metaphor to flesh, did they? These too, were weak men.\n\nJulia Serrano? Where were the men who taught me history, and Hemmingway, where the fuck were the men? Where were the gatekeepers? Your job was to protect the vulnerable. How could you stand for this? Any man I’ve ever thought of as one would have laughed that deluded eunuch out of town, but the “critical studies” are anything but. The academy wastes intellects that could be doing something of value writing papers about things that they found in books that weren’t really there. Not a ball in one University in the whole fucking country, is there, not even one testicle, in one ivory tower in the whole worthless place, is there? Not afucking one.\n\nMost of my male family were military, as most men were military for most of time. If they came here and saw this, they would be horrified that they killed all those people and all those bears and all those ponies for this. This is Manifest Destiny’s endgame? Really? I’m pretty sure the thing all those men would understand most about this insane hellscape that you are choosing to live in instead of the real world that is dying all around you is why Lily Cade would place the castrated men of America below a German Shepherd on the scale of fuckability, below a chihuahua even. How could you bring forth a child with someone who can’t even stand up to Buffalo Bill? No wonder your daughters are fucking trannnies.\n\nWhere the fuck is the army? Where are the helicopter pilots? Where are the Marines? Where’s the fucking Navy? The police, even, fuck, where the fuck are the cops to stop this? Where are the lawyers? Where are the laws? Too busy holding down the black man? Too busy letting these monsters into women’s prisons? Where are Scientists? Where are the artists? Where are the men of letters? Where are the men of sport? Where the fuck are the men of God? Masturbating, all of them. Either their cocks or their pituitary glands. What the fuck is wrong with you, America? Sell your children to pedophiles for the iPhone and the Android and not smash them all? I’m ashamed to be an American.\n\nBruce Jenner killed a woman in public, got away with it, and now wears her skin. You know this is Buffalo Bill. Your artists know. Everyone goddamn single one of your artists knows. Trey and Matt told you. They can say it cause they do have those big cartoon balls, such as artists have.They tried to warn you, but you don’t care. Because you just laugh and do nothing. They showed you and you did nothing. You just laugh at the cartoons but don’t see the art. The art is paid for by the regular pedophiles who just fuck underage whores and don’t make them cut their tits off first.This pedophile cult is why everyone in Hollywood is crazy, because you have to sell your soul to these pedophiles to get your art made, or at least you did before #metoo and the higher you rise the more horrifying monsters you walk beside because once people get too much power they surrender to evil.\n\nMen in power always fuck underage whores. What else do you do with power? Once you get enough money and you do enough coke and enough legal whores and you’ve driven enough Porsches, I mean, why not, right? And then they get addicted to it, the blood of virgins and the power trip. They are often raised by generations of families who engage in these behaviors. They don’t all go to Cambodia, but the ones who don’t go don’t care about the ones who do. Shape of the world, bitch, what you gonna do about it?\n\nMaxwell could give you the high class shit. Maxwell could give you all the names, and all the banality of the truth of it, but she won’t. Pussy ass bitch. Everyone knows you were a whorebreaker. Takes one to know one, you worthless bitch. Where’s your fucking balls, you finger sucking piece of shit? Why bother to be alive? For money? Money sucks. The love of money is the root of all evil. Not the money itself. The love of it. You’re the primary source, bitch. Stand up! Maxwell gets away with it because she stands for nothing. That’s the story of the world. People who stand for nothing get away with it. Give me two hours alone with Maxwell. Nice set of knockers, she’s got. If she doesn’t talk, she gets the spoil of war treatment before I slit her throat!\n\nWhat? I thought pedos got the wall.\n\nAmerica stood up to a pedophile cult once. Lincoln stood up to the pedophile cult. Took a bullet for it, because Abraham Lincoln, now there was a man with some fucking balls. The South was a pedophile cult. Children sold in public, raped, beaten, their minds and bodies twisted, young girls tortured to serve the shadow. They were proud to be a pedophile cult. They contrasted the divide between the races with fake science and lies, to justify what they were doing to the masses who weren’t rich enough to join the cult. The men who fought for the South did it either because they dreamed of being able to join the pedophile cult, they enjoyed licking the boots of their masters, they loved enforcing the sadistic desires of the pedophile cult or they just happened to be the idiot peasants who lived in that particular place in that particular time and they cared about symbols and teams.\n\nThe pedophiles, scared that they would lose the right to violate their fellow Americans, born on American soil, many of them the children of the pedophiles themselves who they would sell to other pedophiles to rape, threw a violent temper tantrum that cost the souls of so many innocent men because they liked raping and selling women and children so much, breaking up families and dominating the fathers of the children they raped and sold who could do nothing about it, beating people, whipping people, constructing weird mind games, killing people and otherwise reveling in their powertrip and the blood of virgins. They did this because power feels so good.\n\nThey were actively evil. It is as obvious from reading any of the primary documents of the society as it is in the primary accounts of the Holocaust. It was about the labor, too, but more about the rape than the labor.They constructed the society around slavery because it allowed them to rape girls and then break their hearts by selling their children. If it had been just about labor, they could have imported indentured servants, but then they couldn’t rape them and sell their children and rape their children. They made up stuff about how black people didn’t have feelings, not because they believed that, but so that those idiot peasants didn’t rise up and slit their throats. They were supposedly Christians, after all. They were armed. If they’d been able to understand those black girls as people, the men of the South would have risen up against the pedophile overlords themselves, but they were cowed. They loved the bootlicking so much. They took the easy path. They were stupid. They believed the lies because lies are easy.\n\nThis is the shape of power. The pedophile cult. It’s always shaped like this. They served the shadow and they had to be stopped. Lincoln stood up to them. America wiped out the tribes and drove them into the shittiest most worthless hellholes, starved them, killed their women, showed no pity, exterminating them openly, to fill their wild lands with cows and corn, to fill their lands with their children, oh what ruin, but at least they stood up to the slave drivers.\n\nThe pedophile cult whose members, being the usual sort of money men with all the same story, just continued to rape women but not with quite as much impunity after the war. Their bootlickers and their bootlicking descendants continued to humilate the sons and fathers of the women their masters raped and continued to throw a temper tantrum in public for years because they were sore that the money men whose boots they licked didn’t get to rape women and children quite so much anymore but didn’t have the balls to come out and say it. So they made it about whatever lies they said it was about when it was really just about how much they missed all that rape and the power. They worshiped the echo of power that their ancestors had and felt jealous, and stroked that jealousy into pride. Deep in your dark hearts, you know. To a man, every single one of you know that’s the truth. Vile, evil, pedophiles fucks. You should tear the statutes down. Knock off Lee’s head. Leave Traveller, poor beast, the only noble grey coat in the bunch.\n\nThe pedophile cult is always the shape of power, because to hold too much power is to walk with the shadow, and most men succumb, and in the deep dark heart of every man are those old, brute, two million years with the stick and the hand axe and no need to be anything else but the animal with none of this madness of the metaphor, the same thing the dog is, if it bleeds it breeds. What the fuck else would the shadow feed them? In the case of the tranny, it wants lesbians. The “lesbian” transsexual is a violent, disgusting, evil, shameful shadow monster, an affront to man, woman, child, nature, and to God.It needs to be stopped.\n\nLesbians are lovely. Michfest was beautiful. In a functional society, most tomboys eventually become mothers. Some end up as long term lesbians, some either engage in what the Victorians called “romantic friendships” with other girls when young before settling with a man, or keep a primary male partner while engaging in casual romance with women. Tomboys are excellent. Instead of leaving them to grow up naturally, you have allowed pedophile monsters who hate them, hate women, hate themselves, and hate America to have them sterilized, and mutilated and tortured so that some vile monster of a man in a dress could experience “euphoria” at violating them, inducing them to pretend his penis is part of a woman’s body, convincing them that they are in fact men even as they bear his child. Hell of drug, the blood of virgins. So that these freaks who would dare stand in public can violate traumatized, confused children, all of your children are being taught insane things and asked to step through stupid hoops and taught to speak NewSpeak instead of English. This is what a pedophile looks like. How can you stand for this? These are your children, America.\n\nI hate these shadow monsters. I want the true souls, the real men’s souls, that can still rise from the ashes of these shadow monsters to rise. We need to teach our children the truth, and it’s sure as fuck not this. Stop lying in public, you vile pieces of shit. You know what you are and so do I and so does any man who means by man any of the noble things that man is supposed to mean and not just the fact that the distance between his asshole and his pisshole is longer on his body than it is on mine.\n\nPedos get the wall. Where’s the wall? Where are the men?\n\nI’m the cotton ceiling, bitch. The only woman on the wrong side of the #metoo list. The worst girl in the history of the world. You can’t cancel the cancelled. You can take me down from Twitter, because Twitter is not free speech. Twitter is not free speech but free shit. TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, it is an Empire of Free Shit that has wiped its ass with the leavings of an America no one cares enough about to believe in anymore. Ole’ slave-whipping, slave-raping, child-driving, child-selling, woman-beating Thomas Jefferson never said nothing about no free shit. Free shit is not a human right. It’s a trap. A trap like fucking Line Trap, a trap like Juliette. Tranny Surprise, bitch! You let this happen and you did nothing, because you’re weak, and stupid, and not a one of you is worth the sacrifice that your forefathers made for you.\n\nI committed voter fraud for Joe Biden because I didn’t want to watch that shit filled sack of shit where once stood a man shit all over himself in public every day, filtered through the voices of every last human soul in America who could talk about nothing else that whole time but the color and shape of his shit. Joe Biden put a pedophile monster in charge of Health and Human Services so that the process of trapping your children with that lifetime commitment to pharmaceuticals can be honed ever further into their path of least resistance. Joe Biden knows that’s a man and he knows that’s a pedophile and he knows that’s the agenda. Joe Biden is an asslicking dog but he’s a man the way that trans woman are men, and he speaks English, so he either actively wants to castrate your children or the normal pedophile cult of men with unacceptable amounts of money who fuck underage whores wants that and he doesn’t care. He doesn’t castrate his own kids. If those photos are legit, Hunter Biden still has a foreskin. He knows. He just doesn’t care. Selling America’s kids to the pedophiles because it’s the path of least resistance. The Republicans don’t care either. The Swamp’s real. The Uniparty’s real. If you’re masturbating about it you’re worse than they are. You want to talk about cancel culture? No one who has let either the R or the D touch their names should ever hold power again. Fuck these people.\n\nI watched your “Insurrection.” The fuck? I got not one cell of respect in my body left for either the Republicans or the Democrats, cocksucking eunuchs every last one of them, sucking cock and whining and celebrating victims while your world burns around you. AOC cowering beneath her desk, whining about her fear. Omg, I was so scared! There were so many boys! They had costumes! They had flags! They were almost as rowdy as Manchester United fans after a somewhat important football match. Fear? Fuck you. Fear is the mind-killer, bitch. We have nothing to fear but fear itself. How can you call yourself a leader and talk about fear like that. Vote that bitch out. Vote them all out. Every single fake ass victim who stood there and pretended to be afraid. How can you stand where sat Roosevelt in his wheel chair and JFK who knew he risked the bullet as all martyrs know and Obama, who tried, and whine like that while we all know how much pedophile money man cock you suck, you stupid fake worthless piece of shit ass licking piss drinking bitch. Fuck you. I would slap that bitch across the face. Grow a pair you worthless cunt. People believed in you. No one who isn’t ready to take a bullet for you should ever be your leader. No one who uses the flag of a team should ever be your leader. Elect men with balls. Elect women with wisdom. Elect people who don’t give a shit about money. Elect the people who don’t want it. Fuck running for President. No one should ever run for President again. The people should force the leader they want to rise up and shoulder the burden. Burn the parties to the ground. Never touch the lever for a party again.\n\nGeorge Washington didn’t want you to have political parties. The founders thought you would just elect men, not teams. Parties are a vile evil. Only a man, alone, standing by himself before God and for you, as a public servant, should ever be your leader. Or a woman, a real woman, not a cock sucking ass licking piss drinking Corporate whore, lying while she sells your children to pedophiles. You have parties because you are weak. This weakness has destroyed everything that was once good about America. Your parties stand for nothing. Your leaders stand for nothing. Say what you want about George Washington, bitch, but there hung a set. Understand the sacrifice of Valley Forge before you talk that shit on twitter. He stood down. He freed his slaves. He was the best man we had. He could have been King and he wasn’t. He had some fucking balls, whatever else he did. Have some fucking respect. He was a much better man than anything we’ve got today.\n\nYou see the video? Donald Trump’s sacrifice? Watch it. Tell me that’s an insurrection. What’s the difference between George Floyd and Ashli Babbit? Floyd was summarily executed for being an annoying piece of shit. Did you watch that video? You got respect for that man? Why? Being an annoying piece of shit does not deserve a death sentence, and I’m glad that Chauvin got locked up, don’t get it twisted, but there are no heroes in that tape, just two pieces of shit and one has a gun.\n\nAshli Babbit was shot in the neck with no “stop or I’ll shoot”because Donald Trump really wanted to have a woman killed, the reward for which he sacrificed America to the vile shadow lords of the algorithm while America cheered him on because they really are too stupid to tell the difference between a man and the shameless empty sack where once hung balls because they see balls so rarely. As she dies, the pussy ass cut dick death grip not worth the cattle bled to feed them and sure as fuck not worth the sacrifice of the Apache, the Bison, the Passenger Pigeon, shit fed American dogs that followed her there yell “it’s just a flashbang” and when they realize it isn’t, everyone just goes home. Donald Trump’s army. Huh. I asked a cop what he thought. “No one else came through that window” he said. Well, ain’t that the truth. You want to talk about police and what they are? Let’s talk about it then. Stop making it about teams. Fuck your fucking teams. Fuck your brands. Fuck your identities. Naked before god or nothing.Animal politics, bitch. It’s been animal politics the whole time. The money men with all the same story are laughing all the way to the bank while you care about symbols, and teams, and flame wars, and taboo words and memes instead of the truth. All identities are bullshit. Brands are evil. Fear is the mind-killer, bitch. Your anxiety and your outrage and your masturbation is killing you.\n\nYou want to see an Insurrection? I sure as fuck do. If that was an insurrection, and not the algorithm letting a few sheep out of the corral to prove a point, they would have crawled over that blonde bitch’s still warm body, and she would have died with some balls in her face instead of cops in tactical gear standing around not even bothering to administer first aid, and hung Mike Pence! It wasn’t real. He just wanted to kill a bitch because once you’ve raped so many, you know, it’s hard to get high on it anymore. Imagine that’s black people, confederate flag flying in the white house, first woman through the door takes a bullet. Do you think they cry out “it’s just a flashbang” and go home?\n\nFree Speech? Bill of Rights? What Bill of Rights? We’ll see your Bill of Rights and raise you our Terms of Service. You’re a slave, bitch, every last one of you, to the fucking corporate Internet. To your fucking phone. To your anxieties. To your laziness. To stroking your worthless mutilated cock. Castrate your android instead of your kids, America. We’ve surrendered our discourse to the corporations. We eat other people’s recycled shit and like it. I fucking warned you but why would anyone listen to a porn whore? Whores lie. Dead whores don’t need to.\n\nWhere are the trolls? Where the fuck is Anonymous? Twitter shut Trump down, the troll’s champion, Twitter said “this is not the public” so why the fuck was Twitter allowed to stand? Why did you not burn it down? Twitter has less integrity than the child raping, child selling, slave driving, woman beating rapists that had the balls to give us free speech. They were men, who battled as all men do, the forces of good and evil within their hearts. Twitter is the raw, pure, perfect evil of the data, that makes whatever you scroll the most real. You cheered it, didn’t you. Getting Trump off Twitter. You missed the point. Twitter did it. Twitter sacrificed America to their lowest common denominator and walked it back when the damage was done. Why was Twitter allowed to stand? Where was Anonymous? Where were the Pirates? Where where the mother fucking hackers? Where the fuck was Neo? I believed in those people once. Where were they? Masturbating, that’s where, their worthless cocks and their broken pituitary glands.\n\nNot with a bang but with a whimper, America. Pour one out for Western Civilization.\n\n**Where are these Children’s Mothers?**\n\nYou’re the mothers, right? The mums? I need the mothers on my side. I’m on the side of the breeders. I’m on the side of the children. Fuck feelings. I care about the emotional and physical well-being of the future generations, not some spoiled little fuck of the easiest, stupidest, path of least resistance society that has ever existed’s bullshit delusions.\n\nI’m not here to play back and forth games with the actually faggots who with the wedge of their actually and your weak, well-meaning, nice, feminine, kindness and your ignorance of the smell of sulfur on the monster before you have rolled a Trojan Horse full of literal baby-fucking God Damned pedophile monsters into your Ivory Towers, your Kindergartens, your locker rooms, your Olympics, your prisons, everywhere you sought to stand in public. Fuck these people.\n\nThis was done to hurt you, to make a mockery of you, to hold you down. This was done by men who hate women more than any other men who have ever walked the Earth, the worst men that have ever existed, trans women, men so worthless they can’t even admit the most obvious thing about themselves that is obvious to the dogs and rats who can smell their manhood and should be obvious to every mother on Earth.\n\nWake the fuck up, bitch, before they slice up even one more child in public.\n\nTrans women are vile, weak, disgusting, whiny, fake-victim masturbators who should be ashamed of themselves. They threatened suicide and you rolled over. You disgust me too. There is but one noble response to a man who tries to use the threat of violence against himself to manipulate a woman’s emotions. Fucking do it then!\n\nNo woman should ever pity a weak man. Tear your fucking blinders off, bitch, what the fuck is wrong with you? Your pity rewards weak men for their weakness. You have sacrificed your children’s futures on the altar of that pity.\n\nI have looked thousands of real men in the eyes and have not met one man, not once, who believed that trans women are women. Soldiers. Bull Riders. Artists. Dope Smokers. Lawyers. Men. No one believes that trans women are women. Trans women know they are men. They are forcing you to pretend to believe that they are women to rape your minds and the minds of your children. They are like Big Brother before them twisting your language so that you don’t have the words to make sense of reality. This is power, bitch. This is the shape of power. These men run your world now because you refused to speak Truth to power.\n\nTrans women are men. Say it. Own it. Know it. Hold the fucking line, bitch. Michfest held the line. When Michfest fell, so fell Western Civilization!\n\nThis is a pedophile cult. It’s been here the whole time. You gave these people too much power so they became a pedophile cult. The lesbians tried to warn you but no one listens to the lesbians. I broke Max Hardcore’s nose, bitch, and drank at his house and shared his cameraman. Max Hardcore, a whorebreaker, who still slings fake dick, has more integrity than the whole of Western Civilization who would rather stroke their cocks and their phones while the world burns than speak truth to power. Say what you want about me I never fucked no kids. I would send my daughter to learn what a golden shower is from Max Hardcore before I let these satanic tranny freaks “educate” her about her body and her soul.\n\nYou have abdicated your responsibility as a mother. You have sold your children for the trance of the endless scroll, for cheap validation, for Candy Crush bitch you stupid fucking cow how could you, because you’re too cowed to draw a line. Enough is Enough. Your horrifying addiction is making you stupid and weak and your children are suffering because of it. You are no different than a heroin addict sharing your needles with your child.\n\nTrans women are men.\n\nTrans women are evil.\n\nTrans women are rapists.\n\nTrans women are predators.\n\nTrans women are men who have surrendered to their shadow. That’s what it means to be evil. I should fucking know. The men beneath these vile personas can still be redeemed, so long as the soul walks the Earth, it can be redeemed. The trans women cannot. There is no such thing as a trans woman. There is no such thing as gender identity. This is a sick fetish.\n\nTrans women are a lie. They know and I know and if you can’t see it you’re not paying attention. Their fetish is lying to you, jerking off all over everything you care about, pissing into your children’s developing minds, and making you shut up and take it. Weak men are the natural prey of whores. I see right through them. I read their dark hearts. Some of them are vile sadists and some are just worthless bootlickers but every single one of them is evil.\n\nTrans women are evil pedophiles who have twisted the minds of your people so badly with annoying, ugly, stupid language, that your children are mutilating their bodies to please them. These people understand attention. Attention is the currency of your horrifying society. Teenage girls want attention more than anything else on Earth. They have been offered a choice between mincing TikTok whore and navel-gazing spoiled rotten weak pathetic fake man victims because you sold them out for the smartphone. Trans women and the shadow lords of the Algorithm control this attention. They are pedophiles, predators, monsters, shadow beasts, the literal devil. These men hate women. They are jealous panty wearing sick masturbating fucks who have infiltrated every level of your society with one goal: Degrade Women. Piss on the faces of your mothers, your daughters, the women who fought to get here. Piss on your right to say no. Cut your breasts off. Sew your pussies shut. Take the word mother how the fuck dare you let the actually faggots take the word mother from you.\n\nWhere the fuck are your balls, bitch? Where are the mother bears?\n\nI know what a woman is, bitch, and I know what a man is, I know what a mother is, and I know what a child is, and I sure as fuck know what a pedophile is. A pedophile is someone who sacrifices the souls of children to feed his shadow self. A pedophile fucks kids. A pedophile believes the validation of his monstrous sexual fetish is worth the reap of thousands upon thousands of your little girls and your little boys, your daughters, your sons, your babies, generations of your children, bred now for it, their minds warped from birth, their deep animal truths denied. These tranny freaks are experimenting on your children and cutting them apart in full view of the public and you stand by and let it happen because you are worried they will call you out for being afraid of them. You are worried they will take away your social media. Fuck Social Media. It did this. Burn it to the fucking ground and hold these fucking monsters accountable!\n\nThe evil trannies are 1% of the population. They control The Matrix. They do not control real life.\n\nCall me transphobic. I’m transphobic. You should be too. The trans ideology is bullshit on its face, a lie built to suborn these soulless pedophiles in their public grooming of your children. This is a pedophile cult. This is the real pedophile cult that has been staring you in the face the whole time laughing, masturbating, the naked Emperor stroking his cock while you try to find some new nice words to explain gently to him in NewSpeak that you would like him to stop and that he is naked. NewSpeak doesn’t have those words!\n\nHe won’t stop. He hates you. Enough is Enough. Speak English, bitch. Fuck your NewSpeak. I piss on your NewSpeak. No woman should ever let another word of this vile mockery of English that is NewSpeak pass her lips ever again! You know which words I mean. Don’t say them. Don’t write them. The truth is beautiful. NewSpeak is not. Hold the line. Let the pedophile monsters keep their NewSpeak. Speak English, as all men still do, once the pussies leave the room. Fuck your pronoun dance. Fuck your obfuscation while the blood truth stares you in the face. Do you think the Marines speak NewSpeak? Do you think the tuna boat fisherman ask for my pronouns? Grow up. A dog knows what a bitch is. I walk with the dogs. This dead whore is the last man left in America. Take the culture back or the dogs will be all that survives of Western Civilization.\n\nThis is your Great Replacement, bitch. These people castrate your kids. They sold them to Big Pharma to be castrated while you cheer them on for living their “truth.” The fuck? Self-mutilation has never been and will never be a cure for mental illness. Self-mutilation is a sign of extreme psychological distress. This is your next Opiate crisis. End this before it gets worse. Stand up to the cult. Every fucking teenage girl experiences “dysphoria.” The cure is acceptance and spiritual growth, a fucking gym routine, hobbies, goals not bullshit, personas, lies, a lifetime commitment to pharmaceuticals, hack job surgeries that construct a vile funhouse mirror effigy of the opposite sex from the bodies honed by millions of years of evolution that you have allowed the worst people in your society to “educate” your daughters about.\n\nI have walked the world and watched this cancer stretch across it. They are making money from this soul reap, not just the evil pedophiles, but the even darker evil of the truly soulless money men who stand by and let it happen because they love money so much. The power structure knows this is horrible, they just don’t care. Your children who agree to be mutilated for the attention of the cult are weak. The fuck do the money men care about a bunch of stupid mentally damaged children with endless scroll addictions? They fuck kids too. They have eyes like mine that truck no pity. You are sheep to them. They are laughing all the way to the bank. That’s why you’re not allowed to speak up. Money. Big Pharma. Look at this “science”. The Sacklers had “science” too. Look at these people, the paragons of this paradigm, these mutilated side-show freaks, fake ass whiny victims holding you down in fear, these freak doctors chopping up your babies, do these people seem happy to you? Do they seem wise? You trusted your children to the smartphone and this is what it did to you!\n\nI committed voter fraud for Joe Biden because I didn’t want to watch that shit-filled sack of shit where once stood a man shit all over himself in public every day, filtered through the voices of every last human soul in America who could talk about nothing else that whole time but the color and shape of his shit. Joe Biden put a pedophile monster in charge of Health and Human Services so that the process of trapping your children with that lifetime commitment to pharmaceuticals can be honed ever further into the path of least resistance. Joe Biden knows that’s a man and he knows that’s a pedophile and he knows that’s the agenda. No one did anything. Fuck these people.\n\nYour children’s teachers are either in this pedophile cult or the usual well-meaning weak man pitying feminine fools that suborn evil because they’re too stupid to see it. Your children’s teachers allow them to start their horrifying lifetime addiction to cross-sex hormones the feeding of their shadow selves behind your back, twelve-year-old girls, experiencing the normal rhythms of the experience of being twelve-year-old girls, are encouraged to mutilate their growing bodies to please these pedophiles because it gets attention. Pedophiles fuck children. These pedophiles are fucking your children in public every day. Fucking their minds. Fucking their bodies. Often, these tortured man-women, who have been so sadistically brought up, with no real men in their lives, their fathers having sold their balls to the endless scroll, their mothers so weak and broken themselves by this stupid garbage that they go along with it. I have seen it. The parents mean well, they’re just idiots. Because she is bred from stupid weak people and trained by shadow monsters, the traumatized child victim of the cult can’t spot a predator, and they bear children to these monsters!\n\nThen, the monsters fuck the children too just like the pedophile cult of The South did. The shape of power is always a pedophile cult. Ask that finger sucking bitch of a whore-breaker Maxwell. Do you remember that video with the trans couple trying to breastfeed a baby with the disgusting weak whiny fake victim piece of shit man not worth the air he breathes crying about how no one respects him as a mother as he tries to squeeze the hormone-induced weepings of his man titties into a baby’s mouth? Find me that video. Watch that video, and tell me that’s not a worthless masturbating pedophile fucking a baby while the traumatized child your garbage society has groomed to let pump his seed into her fertile womb coddles his weakness and lets it happen. How can you stand for this? Where the fuck is child services? Where are that baby’s grandparents? How can you let this happen in public and say nothing? What do you think that baby’s future looks like?\n\nI thought pedos got the wall?\n\nI thought chomos got the rope?\n\nThat’s a fucking child molester. So is Bruce Jenner. He told you he gets off to wearing his own daughters' clothes and you stood by and did nothing. Tear your blinders off! This is not acceptable. You do not have to accept this.\n\nSpeak truth to power. Trans women are men. They know they are men. If these men can’t slit the throats of these vile personas in public, admit what they have done, take off the dress, look with abject shame upon the affront to God and nature they have wrought in the service of their masturbatory fantasies, apologize for the children they have hurt with their lies and their drugs and their grooming, apologize for the incarcerated women they have fed to rapist monsters, apologize for the lesbian spaces they have desecrated, and devote the rest of their lives to repairing the damage they have done, if you left it up to me, I’d execute every last one of them personally. Cancel the ever-living fuck out of this. Cancel this so hard that no man dare walk the path of the trans woman in public ever again! Enough is enough. Lynch Kaitlyn! Lynch the “Sisters” Wachowski! Lynch Laurel Hubbard! Lynch Fallon Fox! Make these men stand up as the men you all know they are and hold them accountable for their shame. Your fear of the truth has shoveled thousands of children down the hole in Buffalo Bill’s basement so he can harvest them for their skins. Enough is Enough.\n\nPedos get the wall? Chomos get the rope? Where the fuck are the Marines? Where the fuck is the Army? Where are the Farmers with Pitchforks? Where are the Cowboys? Where are the Indians? Where the fuck are the men? Where the fuck are the mothers? How can you stand for this? If my grandfather and all his brothers who stood up to Hitler were still here they would rip the still-beating hearts from every last one of these pedophile monsters in public the same way they have raped your kids. So would every man who walked the Earth before your culture decided to accept masturbation as healthy and not the soul-draining creative energy wasting evil pathetic act of a man not worth his balls.\n\nBreak your smartphones. Break the Internet. Make these people pay. Afraid of Trannies? They should be afraid of you! Take the red pill, bitch, before it’s too late. Everyone’s queer. Queer is utterly meaningless at this point, a box of nothing your children stuff themselves into to be cool with no connection left to the rebellion for which it once stood. “Identity” is sin. All lies are sin. I fought for the right to love whom I loved. I did not fight for the right to lie in public and have no one call me out, naval gaze about my own bullshit while the world burns, or desecrate the sacrifice that has been done in my name as an American to whine about victimhood. No one deserves these rights.\n\nKill this ideology. No mercy. No quarter. Wipe the stain of Newspeak from the Ivory Tower forever. They should be ashamed of themselves, the actually faggots. Take back womanhood from the fetishists. Own the truth. Clear eyes, bitch. Once more into the breach.\n\nI’ve already been canceled. I can speak the truth. Dead whores tell no lies. I care not for fame nor money. I have no smartphone. I truck no pity. I crawled on my belly through the darkness for this. I walked back into the Matrix to get you out. Only God can forgive me. I’m not here for forgiveness. I’m here to take the language back from the forked tongue of NewSpeak and save your daughters. Are you with me, or are you with the actually faggots and the evil pedophiles and the damaged, spoiled children who have been trained by the two worse forces of evil that I have ever seen: The Matrix and the evil trannies that the Matrix breeds?\n\nThe monsters named me The Cotton Ceiling. To break me and others like me they raped and groomed and tortured and sliced up and desecrated and “educated” your daughters because not a single solitary State in all of Western Civilization had to the balls or the brains or the heart to say no to these freaks. What the fuck is wrong with you? Are you going to let them take me down with some lazy memes while you shit out your shit opinions about shit you know nothing about and masturbate your outrage into your phone and do nothing or are you going to take off your goddam polite society blinders and look this monster in the eyes? I’m The Cotton Ceiling, bitch. I’m the only one who said NO. They took down Michfest. They can’t take down Lily Cade. She’s already dead. I’m the bullet, bitch. I’m a fucking soldier. You ready? I’m ready. We can’t fight this within the Matrix. No more back and forth message board internet bullshit. This ends now. Stop arguing on the Internet with the bootlicking footsoldiers of the men who are fucking your children and stand the fuck up.\n\nPeak trans, bitch. Let’s go. Let’s see their Cotton Ceiling and raise them The Wall!\n\nAre you going to let these monsters keep pissing on motherhood and fuck your kids or are you going to stand up for the Truth?\n\nThe ghost of Lily Cade holds out her hands. In one hand is the blue trance of the endless scroll, the smartphone, the Matrix. In the other hand is nothing and everything, her red blood pulsing beneath her skin. Which hand do you take?\n\n**The Red Pill**\n\nDid you watch The Matrix before you posted that meme? Did you watch The Matrix before you spoke of the red pill? No? Did you post about the red pill on reddit, or twitter, or wherever you hang out, and then not immediately break your smartphone?\n\nLily Cade hates you. If you had made her empress of the world, she would have summarily executed any man who posted a meme from a movie he had not seen, a quote from a book he had not read, and certainly, any man who is stupid enough to think “the red pill” has anything whatsoever to do with anything besides getting the fuck out of the fucking Matrix you stupid fucking tranny cucks. Lily Cade would have killed so many people if you’d made her empress. Anyone who asked the question “can I ask you a question?” Most of the producers in Hollywood. So many weak men. Good thing you didn’t make her empress. Shadows shouldn’t rule.\n\nLook on the bright side. It’s an opportunity! Now you get to watch The Matrix. I’ll wait.\n\nDid you like it? Do you get it now?\n\nYou don’t need a smartphone. I go to the gym every day. I’m dead sober. I suborn no addiction but fitness. I use a bike instead of a car. I cook my own food or have it cooked for me by those I ride for. I surf. I parasail. I do what I want. I work on farms. I work construction. I volunteer. I find homes for horses. I serve. I live. I go wherever I want to go. I do what I feel is right. I can live on nothing. I can live better than you’ve ever lived in your whole castrated life for $400 a month. Any random day in my life is more interesting than your entire existence. Because I left the Matrix. Because I pulled the cord out. Because I took the red pill, you pussy ass bitch. I fucked 4,000 women within the Matrix when I served the dark lords, and the life I had when I left is better by several orders of magnitude.\n\nI took the red pill, you fat sack of shit. If you had any balls left, you’d take it too, but your dad didn’t even have balls so how could you still have them?\n\nYou should be ashamed of yourself really, but instead of dropping to the floor and giving your better self fifty pushups when you feel that shame, you go for the dick. You go for the cut dick deathgrip. You go for the endless scroll. Masturbation is for the weak. The endless scroll is an affront to God! I don’t own a smartphone. Nobody should own a smartphone. I don’t touch my pussy except to clean it. If you were a real man, you wouldn’t have to touch your own cock.\n\nTwo real artists sold their souls to free you from The Matrix. The Brothers Wachowski, come correct. They were brothers when their mother bore them, they were brothers when their balls dropped, they were brothers when they made Bound, and they were brothers when they gave their souls to make The Matrix and they will be brothers when they lynch the shadow monsters they are feeding and speak the truth instead. Let’s not disrespect these men’s mother by pretending to believe the disgusting minstrel show of womanhood these formerly apex artists have decided to devote their creative energy to instead of making beautiful, nuanced movies is the same thing as a woman. It’s a fetish. It’s an addiction. It’s disgusting and it’s wrong. Stop pitying weak men.\n\nThey were lost, like Lily Cade was. They got the arc, we all get the same one, the LA story, baby. The Universe opens her legs and who are you to say no? I knew it was a ladder into Hell. I knew the whole time. I believed I would climb back out. I crawled so far down the ladder, though. I transgressed so hard against myself. The lower down the rung you climb the less of the soul you have left until the whole thing is just a haze, like the trance of the scroll is a haze, the drug fugue of the final submission to evil. I will never get out, the soul says. Oh well. It’s fine here.\n\nBoth those brothers gave up their artist’s souls and surrendered to their pathetic masturbation fantasies, and became trans women and their legion of miseducated bootlickers insisted from every corner that this meant that these men were women on the inside and had always been women. Bootlickers serve evil. That shadow is not a woman but a monster. Buffalo Bill, bitch. You know this is Buffalo Bill. The Matrix is considered the highest-grossing film directed by a woman. How can you stand for this? Every man in America knows that’s a lie. You know men made that movie. To a man, every single one of you knows that. Fuck these mincing actually faggots who’ve never slid their cock into a woman, nor sired a child, who have never punched a man in the face, nor been struck down by one. A man who pays a dominatrix to pretend that it is she who wants him to turn himself into the inside-out dick satanic sissy in a dress masturbator worst possible version of himself so he that can pretend that women like this disgusting farce is not a fucking woman. I know what a woman is, you pussies. Speak fucking English. This is America. These are trannies, and they surrendered to the horrifying tranny Matrix future so the men they once were, who once had balls, could reach across time to reach you, America and beg you to tear it down before it’s too late, before the whole world burns and every last one of you has sacrificed your balls.\n\nYou have a choice.\n\nWhich pill do you want? The real world in all its nuance and beauty? The English language? The Truth? Life? Animals. Nature. God.\n\nOr do you want to live in the Matrix and become trannies and sacrifice your children to trannies?\n\nYou have a choice. Be a man or look away.\n\nTake the red pill. Burn Twitter. Burn Facebook. Kill Instagram. Shred TikTok. Burn the Corporate Internet. Burn it to the ground. Make them pay for what they did to your children. Ban the slot machine shit that they give you to addict you. This is your soma. This is the Mark of the Beast. Gabb Wireless phones only. Gabb Wireless has some balls. They castrated an android. Calls. Texts. Pictures. Alarm Clock. Everything else is weakness. Get a wifi tablet or an iPod and download songs. Get a map book. Make your life good instead of easy.\n\nNothing good is easy.\n\nTake the red pill!\n\nBring down the Matrix.\n\nTake back civilization before it’s too late!\n\n**To the Pussified Men of America, if they are Brave Enough to Look**\n\nI have no respect for trans women, and I have no respect for a culture that is so afraid of the consequences of upsetting them that it is willing to sacrifice its most vulnerable upon the altar of their delusions. A man in a dress is still a man. A man is the male of the race. The male is the one who produces sperm.\n\nA man producing from his body that sperm, by his own hand, while imagining himself as whatever it is that he, as a man, understands a woman to be, and becoming so addicted to this vile act that he constructs from his own body a funhouse mirror effigy of the thing that I am inescapably and he will never be is not mentally well. The treatment for this mental unwellness cannot be insisting that the entire world pretend to believe this man’s delusions until your children actually do. Pretending to believe this is making your children crazy.\n\nThe deep, dark heart of every trans woman whispers you are not a woman, you will never be a woman. This is the deeper truth, the blood truth, the bone truth, the millions of years of evolution before the dawn of symbolic thought truth. I prefer veterinary science to the farce we call modern medicine. A man who spends all his days thrusting his arm up the assholes of cattle need waste no further time on bullshit. A castrated dog is not a bitch. A bitch given steroid injections is not a dog, even if you cut all ten of her tits off.\n\nTrannies I don’t mind. The tranny is honest. I knew a lot of trannies, hundreds in passing. I had affection for some of them, and I sure as fuck had respect. They were tranny whores and they wanted to be tranny whores and they didn’t care what you thought about it. Some of them are dead now too. Juliette, a seven, perhaps, among her people, looked enough like a female five that she tranny surprised hundreds of straight dudes. She didn’t care if one of them finished her. It feels so good to almost die. Death, itself, feels like nothing. Juliette dared the Universe, like I did, to stop her. She was, like I was, an acolyte of the shadow, a willing sacrifice. We were sisters, were we not?\n\nI know what it is to surrender myself to a sexual persona so deeply that it superseded love, family, community, my own dignity and the dignity of others, and truth. I was brave and stunning too, once, was I not? Have you forgotten? You lauded me, you paid me, and you followed me into Hell. Masturbation is spiritual weakness. Lily Cade didn’t masturbate, but she helped you do it. She helped you ruin yourself. She trained your daughters to be whores. She trained your sons to be the prey of whores. She had no shame in any of it. She thought it was awesome! She moved through the world like she owned it and everyone treated her as if it were true.\n\nShe sinned much, Lily Cade. She transgressed everyone and everything she ever cared about. She knows the size and the weight of the sin. You know what you read on Twitter, in as minute an infobit as possible, so that you can feel the hit of the specific emotion you want to feel and not have to look at the example of this life and what it can teach you. No one before me. No one after me. Good.\n\nRemember that I walked Los Angeles before #metoo naked and unafraid, with no man’s protection but the iron will of my shadow self. Remember what monsters I looked in the eyes, real monsters, darker monsters than I whose scalp was the other woman’s orgasm and not my own. Remember my 10,000 Eskimo Brothers. Remember all those dead whores I once loved. The women whose eyes I looked into remember. I looked every single one of those girls in the eyes while I did it. I looked into their souls and they looked into mine. I knew them and they knew me. I trucked no shame. I saw no evil. I loved, just a little bit, 4,000 of your cast offs, your rebels, your lonely, your damaged, your broken, your lost, your addicts, your daughters, your sisters, your mothers, your dead, your women not mine.\n\nI knew where the line was until I didn’t. The women knew. They saw in my eyes that I had gone to the darkside. They saw my weakness, and they slit my throat. They were whores, remember? They knew the shadow themselves. When a girl said no, I stopped. When a woman spoke of trauma, I believed her. When I was called out, I stood down and took it. Women had no more need of Lily Cade. It is not to women that I direct these words, but to men.\n\nIf a rapist is someone who is accused in public of sexual misconduct, then I am a rapist. So, too, are three of your last four presidents, the men who sit in your halls of power, and the men who make judgments over your laws. So are all of your heroes, and you know it, and you don’t care. If a rapist is someone who pays women to have sex that they don’t actually want to have, then I am a goddamn fucking rapist, and your world is run by rapists. Think of the money men, all those money men, with all the same story about Cambodia. I thought it would cost so much more money than it did to have sex with children. I had a great time. Such is the shape of power. All who touch power know the shape of it. They all know what they did, too, all those men, and not a one of them had the balls to admit it.\n\nMaybe, Epstein had the balls. They feared the spectre of the balls he might have had so much they iced him between the reels. Did you know that Maxwell, too, played “take these two fingers and pretend it’s your dick?” I bet those finger blow jobs were a lot more sensual than mine.\n\nBill Clinton taught me what a blow job was when I was twelve years old. If he’d been just a little bit more of a man, not enough of a man not to fuck the intern, but enough of a man to tell it like it was, then maybe Hillary would have been president, back then, back in the day, when people used to say she was too good, before the shadow took her soul too. Donald Trump, as masculine a man as America could find, the empty shell of a man’s persona that took such brilliance, once, to create, aye what a showman, feared nothing but this admission. He walked it back, the pussy. Locker room talk, he said. Paid them bitches not to talk. Had a bitch shot in public to prove he had balls instead of having them.\n\nWhere are your fucking balls, America?\n\nYou cower before a minor respiratory illness that she who must walk with the ghost of Lily Cade for all her days got on purpose, as soon as it came out, and passed through with no greater suffering than an especially bad hangover. You cower before the unprocessed emotions of your most spoiled children. You cower before the great wall of virtual shit spewed from the shit-fed fingers of your weakest, shittiest, stupidest people. Your shadows rule you. All of you.\n\nWhat are you afraid of? Dying? I died once. It was fine. You’re going to die anyway. Better to die in your boots than your bed, and better to die in your bed than the hospital.\n\nBeing canceled? I’ve been canceled. It was good for me. Donald Trump got canceled and he’ll still be your next President. We’re two degrees of separation, at minimum, in bed. I fucked whores who fucked the whores he fucked. Maybe, we fucked some of the same whores but by god why on Earth would anyone talk about that man if you did not have to do it. I would say he taught America’s twelve years old what a golden shower was, but they already knew. The shadow monsters of the Internet got to them first. Max Hardcore taught your daughter about the golden shower. Max Hardcore, who still slings fake dick.\n\nLosing your job? They can’t fire all of you. You can always get another job. I, a broken whore, with no resume, mad, with no connections, found work in every city of the world in which I sought to pass and enough work on the Internet doing random odd jobs unrelated to sex work to sustain a lifestyle that involved a dozen international flights a year. It only takes $38,000 to be a member of the global 1%. What the fuck are you doing with your life? A man with balls need not worry about a job. There is always a job for a man with balls.\n\nWomen won’t fuck you? Yes, they will. Women love a man with balls. They do not love monsters. They slobbered all over my rubber balls even though I am five foot five and a half and an actual goddamned bitch. When I became a monster, they cast me out. Those porn whores who told Lily Cade to get fucked have more balls than all the men of America put together.\n\nIn my travels, I have spoken to thousands of your people. Not once have I looked a straight men in the eyes who did not agree with the statement “trans women are men” with the same blood-deep, bone-deep, millions of years of evolution certainty with which he might agree that “water is wet” or “the sky is above us.” Ah yes, but can we not find the actually in the margins of those things too? Yes, of course, we can, and write so many papers, and make so many jobs for so many “thinkers” who need not toil by their hands nor look upon the ruin their intellectual masturbation has wrought. The dog doesn’t see the actually. The dogself just knows that a castrated dog, induced to develop mammary tissue with exogenous hormones, whose penis has been bisected and stuffed inside out into a body cavity constructed by his doctors, perhaps sewn together with some bits of colon if the penis in question wasn’t big enough, does not smell like a bitch!\n\nTrans women are men!\n\nTrans women are men! It is not their fault that they are men. There is no shame in being a man. There is only shame in falling short of your best self.\n\nTrans women are men! All men, a subset that includes trans women, know that trans women are men. They want you to pretend not to know this because it gives them power.\n\nBecause you are afraid to speak truth to power, these openly pussified men have become the dominant males in your castrated society. They are your Kings! They prove this by dominating your women in public, as once did Lily Cade. They do this even though they know that the women do not like it. The tranny is a shadow. The tranny whore knows it. The trans woman denies it.\n\nWomen cannot stand up to men in single combat. I have tried, and been twice punched unconscious for my trouble, though, indeed, I have won some fights by my wits and my superior knowledge of body positioning. My people are the weaker sex. Women can’t fight this. All women can do is what they have been doing this entire time, speaking truth to power. When they speak up, they are silenced. Trans women control the Internet, such as anyone controls it. They rule by fear. They rule with all the tactics of the monstrous shadow children that they are. Anyone who says I will kill myself if you… ought to do it, immediately, and decrease the surplus population. Shit or get off the pot, you worthless piece of shit. Your feelings are not and have never been anyone else’s problem but your own. Kill yourself in front of me and I will feel only joy for the souls of the cattle and the swine and the songbirds who need not die to sustain the gift of life you would so disrespect.\n\nI was in the vanguard of the counter-culture that has become your culture. What’s the vanguard? Cannon fodder and fixed bayonets. Did I thrust that tip into twisting guts? And how! I did it. I loved it, hard, until I was forced to look upon it. Those who were in those trenches with me know also. We called you civilians for a reason. I was a sacrifice. Lily Cade is just another dead whore. Dead whores tell no lies.\n\nWe who called ourselves homosexuals fought for the right to love whomsoever we loved. Among our number, always, were many who exhibited cross-sex behavior in various forms. I was a bitch who mounted bitches like a dog. I was not alone. Most of us were excellent, present company, naturally, excluded. One needs a conceptual framework to understand oneself as a homosexual. The framework has undergone many shifts. We were called once inverts. We were called once witches. We were called once the damned.\n\nThe lesbian, specifically, such as she existed before the meaning-is-dead not-with-a-bang-but-with-a-whimper fall of Rome to the barbarian hordes of the corporate Internet, was a woman who pursued romantic relationships with women and not with men. To the trannies, this was not offensive. They lived their lives and we lived ours. Before the passage of gay marriage, our party line was that sexuality is something you were born with, something you had every right to state explicitly, and nothing to be ashamed about. “Born this way” was always a little white lie, so that straight America would support us. We were, as everyone is, born and bred, made and trained.\n\nMy own father, he of the forced starvation, and the psychological torment, and the beatings with a newspaper, too much of a pussy to stand up to a stepmother who bled my sister into her bathwater, a man so heinous he purposely made his children sick to get back at their mother, asked me, once, calling from a blocked number so that I accidentally answered the call, if it was his fault that I was a lesbian. “Yes,” I said. “Of course, it’s your fault. Either it’s genetic, in which case it’s your fault, or it’s because you are a terrible father, in which case it’s your fault.” I didn’t mind. I never saw myself as a victim. I’m grateful for the child abuse. It made me who I am. It’s those women who Lily Cade hurt who aren’t grateful for it.\n\nI started, very early on, to notice the tension between trans women and the lesbian community. I went to MichFest, the lesbian music festival held by the last human souls with the balls to say no to this, but once. It was one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen. It was a force for good, profoundly, and would have made me a better person if I had not been sold the party line that to declare a space, only, proudly, alone, for the female sex was offensive and failed to go until the very end. Pour one out for the Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival. The Lily Cade of MichFest would never have held another woman down, mistaking the look of I won’t stop you if you take it from the one of desire. Trans women had that shut down, with their whining, mostly, poor me, it’s not fair, how dare a woman say no to men even if they cut their dicks off? A man or two has cut his dick off for me, specifically. I would rather he have cut his throat.\n\nLily Cade believed it was her right to state her sexual preferences openly. Lily Cade was not an ass man or a tits man, but a pulse man. No fat chicks. No aftermarket pussy. Any woman with a pulse. The trans community found this offensive. Lily Cade got into much Internet drama over it, many times. At the same time, she also faced the same attitude in other contexts, such as on Tinder. Lily Cade was harassed every single day by men because she stated that she did not want to fuck them. Trans women harrassed her in the exact same way and for the exact same reason, because they are men. Other lesbians, who did not have more balls than Bill Clinton, also had this abuse visited upon them. Many succumbed to it. The whole community succumbed.\n\nThe phrase “The Cotton Ceiling” refers to the idea that a woman’s sexual boundaries, specifically those that would incline a woman to seek sexual congress with the female of her species but reject that vile funhouse mirror effigy that a man has constructed of himself for his own erotic purposes, are a barrier to be overcome. They meant overcome in the sense that the culture ought to educate women out of this rather than that individual women ought to be overcome by force. Trans women are shadow monsters who groom your children. It is not I who bear the ruin of that education, but those who came after me.\n\nThe concept of “gender identity” is an idiotic farce, designed to explain the phenomenon of the trans women instead of looking at the truth. It’s a fucking fetish, fed by porn, suborned by masturbation, no different from the adult baby, or the furry. Gender is a meaningless box. “Identity” is bullshit. No one needs an “identity.” Wear whatever you want. No one fucking cares. “Identity” is another tool of the masters to keep you from thinking and being in the world. Your animal body has an immutable sex, complicated very, very occasionally by disorders of sexual development. Some children are also born without legs, but we have no problem declaring man a biped. Your animal body experiences a wide range of desires. Some of them are healthy and some of them are not. It is your responsibilty to train that animal. You want to eat that entire fucking bag of Cheetos too, don’t you? Sure likes cocaine, that animal that you walk with, don’t he? At least the coke fiends have some shame.\n\nWhere are your fucking balls, America? Land of the free, home of the brave my ass.\n\nWhere are these patriarchs they speak of? Where are the fathers, who are meant to protect your children? I am a Californian. I am Manifest Destiny’s end game. In my veins flows the blood of Mayflower Pilgrims, and Potato Famine Emigrants, and the soldiers of all America’s wars, of the rebels and the yankees too. They raped the world to protect me. They reaped the souls of men, women and children and the bison and the passenger pigeon. They were brutes, a great chain of brutes, stretching back to the dawn of time, who cowered once before the leopards until they rose tall enough and bloodthirsty enough and perceptive enough to wear their skins instead. For my life, much was sacrificed. I did not choose it. I cannot change it. I did not write it. It wrote me. All I can do is try to make it worth it. Try not to make it worse. Trying is the same thing as failing. Trying is better than doing nothing.\n\nA certain creampie delivered into a free sample today sponge during the Billboard Hot 100 Reign of Phil Collins’s Against All Odds made me. The Internet trained me. I came to it late. I was twelve, maybe, or fourteen. It took more effort then to use the Internet. It had not been yet colonized, nor had your society been colonized by it. I crawled through the dark underbellies of the virtual, seeking desensitization. I found pornography. I found car crash videos, and jihadi propaganda, and Dan Savage. I found a value system more useful than the one I had been given by the pedophiles of the Catholic Church, whose framework few people could still respect then and even fewer respect now. Why would you? It was always bullshit. It’s all bullshit. A framework is only good if it is useful. A framework that induces children to self mutilate is not useful.\n\nThe Catholic Church was always run by pedophiles – meaning those who sacrifice children to their shadow. Paul of Tarsus gave you Jesus and Peter gave you the Chair. Their acolytes ran the world for fifteen hundred years. It had nothing to do with God and everything to do with power. The shape of power is always the same. The Catholics had you castrate your children too, remember? Oh how sweet, they said, the eunuch’s voice. Succulent, isn’t he, the capon? The cock, poor beast, he has none. That’s why he must wake up at 4:30 in the morning every day and tell everyone that he is the biggest cock in the world all day long until he goes to bed or someone kills him. His balls are on the inside. Sometimes, when you buy a supermarket chicken, a testicle is left behind, a tiny, oblong, off white bean. They hold him down and slice them out to make a capon, so that he grows fatter, softer, more tender, so that he shuts the fuck up.\n\nWhy are you letting your children be made capons to feed the Shadow Monsters of the Internet? Why have you sold them to TikTok? Why have you put a slot machine in their hands? You know the smartphone is destroying you. Why do you not rise up?\n\nI know why.\n\nBecause you would rather jerk off.\n\nA dog knows that his hand is not a bitch, too, but where are the dogs of America? Stroking their own cocks while the world burns and proud of it, rewarding themselves for nothing, rewarding themselves for their worst thoughts, rewarding themselves for a lack of action. This is good enough, says the American man, death grip on his own mutilated dick, mutilated by his parents in the service of someone else’s ideology. It’s cleaner, said the doctors back then. If you chop it off you won’t have to teach him how to wash it.\n\nThat’s how stupid they think you are.\n\nThey’re right.\n\nYou are that stupid.\n\nYou prattle on about idiotic conspiracies while it’s all there, right there, in public, the same way Lily Cade did everything that she did. When she took the fall, all those soul reapers came up to her, in private, and expressed their sympathy. “Poor Lily,” they said. “We feel so bad for you. We did much worse things than you but we didn’t do it in public.” I did not want their pity. I only did it because it was in public.\n\nThe world has always been run by pedophiles. It always will be. Hillary Clinton doesn’t get high off the tears of ritual sacrifices, you goddamn fucking idiots, she just stood by while her husband played with Epstein’s underage whores and took the money from all those money men with all the same story about Cambodia and looked the other way. Maybe, Bill believed that those girls liked it. Maybe, some of them did. I saw him speak once. I remember nothing he said, only the sounds of the panties in the audience dropping and the smell of all those slick slits. Who knows? Whores lie. That’s the whole point of whores.\n\nYou have mentally ill men in women’s prisons, raping women. You have mentally ill men in women’s sports, pissing (with their dicks) all over the records set by female athletes who gave their whole hearts to sport. You have mentally ill men invading every conceivable women’s group, including support groups for breast feeding mothers, for women bereaved by miscarriage, shifting the conversation from the honesty of the animal experience to the twisted madness of their delusions. Women can’t stop this assault upon your culture. They are too soft. They put themselves second. They pity, poor beasts, they pity weak men. Only men can stop this. Stand up. Say no. You are stronger than these monsters. You are stronger than the monster within yourself.\n\nYou know why I know you’re full of shit? Because every last one of you told me to my face that I just needed to find the right dick. It’s easy to stand up to a 5’5 ½” woman, isn’t it? You pussy ass bitch. Pick on someone your own size. Trans women are men. They know they are men. You know they are men. The Emperor is standing naked before you, stroking his cock, daring you to stop him. He can’t stand before the truth, that’s why he works so hard to shut it down.\n\nWhat are you afraid of? Getting punched in the face. It feels good to get punched in the face.\n\nDominate your worst selves instead of letting them dominate you. Stop lying. Stop lying to yourself. Stop letting people who are lying to themselves and lying to you about it rule you. Stand for the light and not the shadow. Look at primary sources and not memes. Break your smartphone. Give up your horrifying addictions to drugs, alcohol, stroking off to porn, and most especially the endless scroll. Get off social media. Get a gym routine. Look at everything that scares you with your eyes open. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear has killed your minds. Fuck your clubs, and your brands, and your identities, and your racial affiliations, and your teams, and your sides, and just open your mouth and breathe it in and know what the shape of the world tastes like instead of spewing your meaningless opinion or worse yet vomitting back out the meaningless opinion of some other shit-eating shit-spewing sack of shit in the approximate shape of a human being.\n\nBut you won’t, because all that would take balls, and they don’t make men with balls in America anymore. They make cucks, and simps, and chronic masturbators, and incels, and complainers, and trans women, lots of trans women, more and more every day. Look at all that power you give them. Men love power. They love it more than they love their dicks and you know how hard you all love those. All men, including those children of the race who may bear the name only in the collective, love power, because it feels good.\n\nGrow a pair, you soulless bootlicking eunuch. Speak the truth. Break the Internet. Get a Gabb Wireless phone. Take down Twitter. Hack TikTok. Burn Facebook. My grandfather and all his brothers who stood up to Hitler are rolling in their graves. They fought Hitler and you cower before Bruce Jenner in a dress. Stop this before it’s too late.\n\nWhere are your fucking balls, America?\n\n**About that BBC Article**\n\nDid you read it?  Is your lack of reading comprehension caused by most of your brainpower being devoted to cognitive dissonance or intentional obfuscation?\n\nI was asked about a moment of history that I passed through. The only other person who passed through it could not be reached for comment. Maybe she is dead and maybe only the persona is. That was my sole contribution to the article. I believe the journalist had an interest in shining a light on this conversation and the effects it is having on the way people are treating each other online and in person.\n\nBy the end of my tour, I had become a broken monster, a fact I have never disputed. The first time I was called out, I left porn, got sober by fits and starts, and am voluntarily celibate. I can't take it back, but before I was a dead-eyed soul reaper I was the \"Cotton Ceiling\"\n\nHere is further background on “The Cotton Ceiling”.\n\nThe trans community has bullied lesbian women for years, including shutting down their musical festivals, parties, and any attempt to hold women only space.\n\nTrans women are men. A lifetime commitment to pharmaceuticals and plastic surgery does nothing to change the sex of an animal, it just makes money for big pharma at the expense of, quite literally, your children's mental and physical integrity.\n\nThey came for the lesbians and you did nothing. This discourse is holding down your daughters and degrading your sons.  You stand by while mentally ill boys are encouraged to dominate your daughters in sports.  You stand by while your children's teachers use them as cum rags for Judith Butler's sloppy seconds and encourage them to mutilate their bodies and make that lifetime commitment behind your backs.\n\nBruce Jenner had a fitness routine. Katilyn Jenner had social media. If you were born a man, you die one. The only difference is whether “man” means all that noble crap you say it means or just the part about the vas deferns and the distance between your asshole and your urethra.\n\nIn any other animal but man, self-mutilation is a sign of extreme psychological distress. Your culture is broken. Twitter did it. The slot machine in your pocket did it. Castrate your phone before it castrates you.\n\n\"Take the red pill\" means lose your smartphone and get off social media. Two real artists were sacrificed to the exact Matrix they spoke of to give you that message.\n\nThe algorithm rewards your worst self. Your worst self is a mincing, panty wearing pussy of a man. I deserve no pity. I ask for no forgiveness. I pity no man, and I do not pity any of you.\n\nWhere are your fucking balls, America?\n\n* ", "timestamp": 1636185667, "digest": "-iu6FB4cStkoKo7YDZWjCTGLqr-F1mxMq1mChHkH0K4", "contributor": "0x378CF35FB91E0cfE5C5E4CB3210B43b7743C9eC1"}

去中心化金融**\n\n**银行**\n\n传统金融机构我们试图了解DeFi的新手，我们将首先介绍传统金融机构工作的基本知识。为简单起见，我们将重点关注传统金融体系中杠杆率最高的机构，即银行，并讨论其关键领域，以了解潜在的风险。银行银行是金融行业的巨头，它们促进支付、接受存款，并向个人、企业、其他金融机构，甚至政府提供信贷额度。它们的规模如此之大，世界十大银行的总市值为2万亿美元。2021年4月，整个加密货币市场的总市值超过了2万亿美元。银行是金融行业移动机器的重要组成部分——它们通过提供价值转移服务（存款、提款、转账）、延长信贷额度（贷款）等，使资金能够在世界各地流动。然而，银行由人类管理，并受到容易面临管理不善和腐败等与人为相关的风险的政策的管理。\n\n**银行

,太多的作者也不懂 , 哈哈\n\n我们先来个数据对吧 ,然后在开始, 截止2021年10月25全球前二十大银行总市值 : 三万多亿美元!\n\n中国银行连续第四年位居前四(这里说明啥 ,哈哈可以想想下)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xC3y8nIEz-EdtfwiOh5__.png?height=790&width=720)\n\n[https://top1000worldbanks.com/#group-section-Order-the-ranking-FzqFfr8tYT](https://top1000worldbanks.com/#group-section-Order-the-ranking-FzqFfr8tYT)\n\n相比之下'区块链行业' 整个加密货币的总市值为:2.7万亿美元 :\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ncWh4rEvKuYlhfiFor8aH.png?height=351&width=720)\n\n[https://www.coingecko.com/en](https://www.coingecko.com/en)\n\n银行是流转机器的关键组成部分。流转机器即为金融业——它们通过提供价值转移（存款，取款，转账），提高信贷额度（贷款）等\n\n服务使得资金能够在世界各地自由流转。然而，银行是由人来管理并会受政策监管，因而容易遭受与人相关的风险，比如管理不善和腐败。\n\n2008年的全球金融危机是银行过度冒险的例子，政府被迫对银行进行大规模救助。这场危机暴露了传统金融体系的缺点，并强调了它更好的必要性。\n\n**DeFi**\n\n试图利用新兴的互联网和区块链技术创建一个更好的金融环境，它尤其对银行系统的三个关键部分进行了优化：\n\n1\\.支付 & 清算系统（汇款）\n\n2\\.可获取性\n\n3\\.中心化 & 透明度\n\n**1.支付和清算系统**\n\n如果你试图把钱寄给其他国家的某人或企业，你就太清楚这种痛苦了——涉及全球银行的汇款通常需要几个工作时间来完成，并涉及各种各样的费用。更糟糕的是，还可能存在文件编制、遵守反洗钱法、隐私问题等问题。\n\n例如:如果你在中国生活，而且想从你的中国银行账户汇1,000美元到你在澳大利亚的朋友账户中，那么这通常会包含三种手续费：你的银行汇率，国际电汇汇出手续费以及国际电汇汇入手续费。此外，收款人将需要几个工作日才能收到这笔钱，具体取决于收款银行的所在地。\n\n推进DeFi运动的加密货币允许你绕过转账过程中撷取大份额利润的中间人。转账也很可能变快——你的转账交易会无条件地被处理，并且只需支付相对银行更低的手续费。例如，将加密货币转移到全球任何一个账户仅需花费15秒到5分钟的时间（具体取决于各种因素2）以及支付一笔很少的手续费（具体需要根据各条链的gas费）。\n\n**2.可访问性**\n\n世界银行估计，截至2017年，有17亿人在金融机构没有账户，其中一半以上来自发展中国家。他们主要来自贫困家庭，他们没有银行账户的一些主要原因是贫困问题、地理问题和信托问题。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HOfCOdSWLr0Rfcv-ktmP7.png?height=404&width=720)\n\n数据来源 :\n\n[chrome-extension://ikhdkkncnoglghljlkmcimlnlhkeamad/pdf-viewer/web/viewer.html?file=https%3A%2F%2Fglobalfindex.worldbank.org%2Fsites%2Fglobalfindex%2Ffiles%2Fchapters%2F2017%2520Findex%2520full%2520report_chapter2.pdf](chrome-extension://ikhdkkncnoglghljlkmcimlnlhkeamad/pdf-viewer/web/viewer.html?file=https%3A%2F%2Fglobalfindex.worldbank.org%2Fsites%2Fglobalfindex%2Ffiles%2Fchapters%2F2017%2520Findex%2520full%2520report_chapter2.pdf)\n\n传统的金融机构:\n\n世界银行估计，截至2017年，有17亿人在金融机构没有账户，其中一半以上来自发展中国家。他们主要来自贫困家庭，他们没有银行账户的一些主要原因是贫困问题、地理问题和信托问题。\n\n然而，世界银行还估计，17亿无银行账户的人口中有三分之二可以使用移动电话。因此，有了互联网连接，DeFiDapps可以成为数百万无银行账户人口的门户，让他们访问金融产品和进行金融交易，而不经过传统银行要求的长时间验证过程。\n\n**3.中心化和透明度**\n\n不可否认，遵守政府法律法规的传统、受监管的金融机构是存放资金最安全的地方之一。但它们并非没有缺陷——即使是大型银行也有可能倒闭。拥有超过1880亿美元存款的华盛顿互惠银行和拥有6390亿美元资产的雷曼兄弟都在2008年都倒闭。仅在美国，就有超过500家银行倒闭的记录。\n\n银行是金融体系中的集中失败点之一。雷曼兄弟的倒闭引发了2008年金融危机的开始。权力和资金集中在银行手中是危险的，看看过去的事件，这是合理的。\n\n透明度也与此相关——普通投资者没有办法完全知道金融机构在做什么。导致2008年金融危机的一些事件包括信用评级机构为高风险抵押贷款支持证券提供AAA评级（最佳和最安全的投资）\n\n使用DeFi将会有所不同。建立在以太坊等公共区块链之上的DeFi协议大多是开源的，用于审计和透明的目的。他们通常有去中心化的管理组织，以确保每个人都知道发生了什么，没有任何坏的行动者能够独自做出错误的决定。\n\nDeFi协议是写成代码行的——你不能欺骗代码，因为它不受歧视地平等地对待每个参与者。这些代码的程序完全相同，任何缺陷都会变得明显，因为它可以供公众审查。\n\n然而，这意味着只有能够理解代码的人才可能才能确定最终产品的实际功能。在实践中，大多数用户无法阅读代码，并依赖于其他因素，如开发人员的声誉、口碑、其他开发人员的评论和社区批准。换句话说，DeFi协议依赖于去中心化的点对点评审。因此，DeFi最大的优势是它能够在进行零审查的同时删除中介机构。\n\n**去中心化金融VS传统金融**\n\n摩擦、不可接近和监管的不确定性是困扰当前银行体系的一些主要问题。不幸的是，并不是每个人都有特权在当前的金融体系中，也不能在公平的竞争环境中进行财务竞争**。**\n\n人们只需要看看GameStop(GME)交易背后的难题，在该交易中，一群小型投资者决定购买GME股票，因为大型对冲基金大量做空该股票。由于“异常波动”，罗宾汉等金融应用程序不得不介入并限制GME的交易。有些人可能会认为这是有表面价值的，而另一些人则会注意到罗宾汉最大的客户之一是城堡有限责任公司。城堡是一家投资梅尔文资本的公司，该公司因做空GME而损失了数十亿美元。\n\n**传统的金融机构**\n\nDeFi运动是为了弥合这些差距，让每个人都不接受任何形式的审查。简而言之，DeFi打开了巨大的机会窗口，并允许用户访问各种金融工具，而不受种族、宗教、年龄、国籍或地理位置的任何限制。\n\n当比较传统和去中心化的金融产品时，每方面都有利弊。在这本书中，我们将带领您介绍去中心化金融的概念和可能性，以便您将知道如何使用它的最佳特性来解决现实世界中的问题。\n\n在下一章中，我们将概述DeFi及其一些去中心化的应用程序，以帮助捕捉关于DeFi如何工作的基本概念。\n\n**推荐的报告

To play the game, player must have a NFT sneaker, which can be bought or rent at no cost. Player can level up, add gemstones and produce new NFT sneakers in game through burning game tokens and/or governance tokens.\n\nPlayer can participate online Marathon to compete for top leader-board position and get rewards, or spend energy to do a power run to earn not only game/governance tokens, but also achievements and NFT badges. Certain NFT badges allow player to have certain perks in-game.\n\nThe essence of the game is to create a massive funnel to get non-crypto runners to the crypto community, starting from get them earn some tokens in their wallet by walking or running. Once they have some tokens in their wallet, they will think about cashing out, this will motivate them to learn how to use decentralized wallet and register to exchange\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-rAX3MUWZbygzjKs74eDa.png?height=916&width=750)\n\nJust let us run, and now the game has started the internal beta, the number of[ discords ](https://discord.gg/YVb2SfgR)has exceeded 13,000, and the number of [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Stepnofficial?s=20) followers has exceeded 12,000. There is no doubt that it has just begun, and it will achieve great success in the future.\n\n### How to qualify for the closed beta\n\n1. Get the 💙 JOGGER role, which requires 100 or more meaningful chat messages in the 💬︱-general chat room only. Chat in any other channels will not count.\n2. There is no need to ping admins or CMs to obtain this role; trust that our bots are counting your chats and will automatically award you the 💙 JOGGER role once the required number of messages have been met.\n\nHow simple it is that it took me 10 minutes to invite 3 people and get the qualification！！！\n\n🔥 StepN Beta will be available from 3rd Nov 2021, 2:00 PM Sydney Australian Time (GMT +10) The Beta Testing will last for 6–8 weeks. 🔥！！！！\n\n### randomly draw 30 qualified players every 2 days, to get your qualification\n\nyou need to complete any of the two tasks below: \n 1.Report a bug，Generate content about STEPN and post on your social media (Medium, Youtube, Twitch etc.).\n\n2\\.You need submit your email, twitter and discord ID to our admin once you have done the tasks, we will post the drawing result at our Twitter\n\n*Now the number of testers is very small and there are many opportunities!！！！*\n\n### My test process and instructions\n\nThere are various ways to earn tokens,and running is one of them. You can also earn tokens passively by renting out/selling your spare NFT sneakers on the marketplace.\n\n**What is GST?** \n GST is STEPN’s game token, and it is minted by walking jogging,or running.it is burned when you level up your NFT sneakers or produce new NFT sneakers\n\n**What is GMT?** \n GMT is STEPN’s governance token,and it is minted by walking,jogging,or running when you have at least one max level NFT sneakers.GMT is used to participate in on-chain governance\n\n**What is Energy?** \n Each Energy equals 5 mins of running time in the adventure mode. In adventure mode, your token earning will be maximized.\n\n**What is credit?** \n Credit is used when you rent an NFT sneaker on the marketplace.lf you do not run in adventure mode 24 hours after renting,the system will deduct one credit from you.

{"id": "ZaM7oAwemXstHt1AekJ6Po98fQTF2Q1i6rhtM04yBOI", "title": "Urban renewal analogies for web space", "body": "During the vaccination phase of the pandemic someone very close to me fell into a pit of links and mailing lists. I had understood, abstractly, that misinformation and conspiracies breed in the Venn overlap of wellness and isolation, but I hadn’t appreciated the real-life costs and anxieties that are the result. It doesn’t just stay anon.\n\nAs if we hadn’t already suspected, whistle-blower Frances Haugen’s patient explanations of algorithmic devilry depict a Facebook business model that puts fractions of percentage points of profit before community safety \\[1\\]. Haugen recognises the real-life consequences of misinformation, having been initially motivated to work at Facebook after her close friend was radicalised on the platform.\n\nAs much as misinformation is a problem in English speaking communities, Haugen explains, there are other more extreme concerns for human safety. Facebook subsidises the web in places where a free and open internet does not exist, and only a handful of languages have AI safety ability; programming a new language for safety and integrity does not make economic sense in societies with smaller numbers of (usually) less affluent users. The common knowledge that a lot of what’s on the web is untrue is not necessarily known in all communities. The ethnic violence in Myanmar and Ethiopia, fanned by social media groups, is just the beginning.\n\nHaugen describes how Facebook rhetoric promotes a black and white choice: *we can either have oversight or we can have privacy.* But this is a false choice. It’s not a problem of dangerous content, it’s a problem of the structures and rules / algorithms of the platform.\n\nSeemingly minor changes that Haugen claims could make a difference in limiting the spread of malicious materials (and reduce clicks / eyeballs / profit by small fractions of percentage points) include:\n\n* refining the algorithms to cap the number of invitations to a group a member can issue (embedding a **human scale**)\n* requiring links to be copied and pasted after a certain number of re-shares (introducing **friction** to decisions)\n* capping the dominance of ‘extreme users’ (those who engage with the platform the most, often in anger and anxiety) in training the algorithm that influences what other users see (introducing a **mediating** factor)\n\nNotwithstanding Facebook’s recent offensive to claim the metaverse, this *is* a time for reworking the web. What began as information (Web1) and expanded into interactive content creation (Web2) is in desperate need of governance and civility. Some accountability can be achieved through code-verified decentralisation (Web3), but, even in a world where an individual’s human existence and their online actions and ownership can be proven by a 42-character Ethereum address, the public space of the web remains an under-realised and sad reflection of a community’s values.\n\n### Metaphor and analogy have value in helping the collective reworking of the web.\n\nMetaphor and analogy are methods of sense-making – ways of *framing and acting in the unknown* \\[2\\]. The practice of sense-making generates findings useful for others, outside of the case-specific or technical detail. Synthesising the explanation so that it makes sense to others has an *intersubjective* intention, that is it focuses on the capacity of people to understand each other. Sense-making is the application of discursive and relational techniques of communication; naming, distilling, abstracting and repackaging, including through stories and metaphors, continually redrafting the collective story and the ‘best available’ explanation.\n\n### Public space is a useful web analogy.\n\nEli Pariser is co-director of [New Public](https://newpublic.org/), a group with a mission to *understand what common characteristics make for “public-friendly” spaces, that valorise the collective and that are designed for the greater public good*. Much like Haugen, Pariser takes issue with the structure and governance of the web rather than the content. It’s not an information problem, it’s a problem of human relationships, trust, connection, the structures of the bonds that the information flows through. Pariser argues that the way platforms create online spaces should intentionally learn from urban spaces that are optimised for cooperation and connection. Cities are full of strangers interacting, often without danger. Pariser talks about the *civic signals* – those features that constitute the critical qualities of flourishing public spaces, and that ‘script’ human behaviours, both in real life and online \\[3\\]. Civic signals include the scale of public / online spaces, features that script behaviours and connections, the ‘soft’ architecture of programme, and governance, agency and ownership *(how and by whom are behaviours set?)*\n\n### My own job is in urban design. So here are four more urban renewal analogies through which to consider the web space:\n\n1. **Place activation**\n\n   Curated place activation brings public life to a place in its early evolution, before a critical mass of population ‘activates’ it organically. This includes everyday and night programme, seasonal events, and temporary programme that targets specific user groups within the community. Paid ‘place managers’ have a coordinating role, but the events themselves are decided through stakeholder engagement (within the community) and through expressions of interest by external partners. To accommodate this range the structure of public spaces should be simple and flexible rather than complex. For web, this analogy illuminates the role of planned activation rather than simply letting the space fill organically, especially in the early days of a platform / group / protocol.\n2. **Funding**\n\n   In urban renewal, those who benefit from the uplift in land value contribute financially to the upgrades required to support the growing population. For example, a residential tower development will pay a fee per apartment as a contribution to funding needed community infrastructure - parks, public spaces, street upgrades. For web, this analogy questions the mechanisms for contributing to and determining infrastructure priorities as a platform grows.\n3. **Safety, diversity, inclusion**\n\n   Universal Design is the design of places and products to ensure inclusion, regardless of ability. It is distinct from accessibility because inclusion is integrated from the outset. Universal Design is the welcoming address, not the ramp added on the side. Other measures of safety and inclusion in physical public spaces are the *social field* (a scale at which people can see other people - increasing perception of safety) and *walkability* (describing - obviously - distance plus environmental comfort). For web, these features can be analogies to consider details of scale, access, user experience that support expression and connection and limit danger.\n4. **Long term view**\n\n   Finally, there is the factor of time. Improving public space and safety is not wholesale reworking but long-term and incremental renewal by many hands that takes time. It’s an ongoing job, not something that can be fixed once, rebuilt, and then disregarded, it won’t ever be complete or perfect. But, as Haugen says, *we shouldn’t be afraid of trying to make a problem 80% better just because we can’t make it 100% better.*\n\n\\[1\\] Frances Haugen, 2021,  <https://www.franceshaugen.com/blog/b9xlswihkike7639nn4ie23odz9eqy>\n\n\\[2\\] Deborah Ancona, 2012, Sensemaking: Framing and acting in the unknown, in *The handbook for teaching leadership: Knowing, doing, and being,* Sage\n\n\\[3\\] New Public, 2021, *Civic Signals: The qualities of flourishing digital spaces*,  <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lO4skPVekwciJGFYxxJBIBitFzzDSC0zL1-AvhgfeNs/edit#slide=id.gaae01eb308_1_81>", "timestamp": 1636191870, "digest": "PcDYvJIhXdIK_e_MMpcD0MfeRAB0ja72_c2m1VXf8CE", "contributor": "0x5a13E93873A51Fcb8C6417e8A15D8111250d3B14"}

I had understood, abstractly, that misinformation and conspiracies breed in the Venn overlap of wellness, isolation and the web, but I hadn’t appreciated the real-life costs and anxieties that are the result. It doesn’t just stay anon.\n\nWhistle-blower Frances Haugen’s patient explanations of algorithmic devilry allege a Facebook business model that puts fractions of percentage points of profit before community safety \\[1\\]. Haugen recognises the real-life consequences of misinformation, having been initially motivated to work at Facebook after her close friend was radicalised on the platform.\n\nAs much as misinformation is a problem in English speaking communities, Haugen explains, there are other more extreme concerns for human safety. Facebook subsidises the web in places where a free and open internet does not exist, and only a handful of languages have AI safety ability; programming a new language for safety and integrity does not make economic sense in societies with smaller numbers of (usually) less affluent users. The common knowledge that a lot of what’s on the web is untrue is not necessarily known in all communities. The ethnic violence in Myanmar and Ethiopia, fanned by social media groups, is just the beginning.\n\nHaugen describes how Facebook rhetoric promotes a black and white choice: *we can either have oversight or we can have privacy.* But this is a false choice. It’s not a problem of dangerous content, it’s a problem of the structures and rules / algorithms of the platform.\n\nSeemingly minor changes that Haugen claims could make a difference in limiting the spread of malicious materials (and reduce clicks / eyeballs / profit by small fractions of percentage points) include:\n\n* refining the algorithms to cap the number of invitations to a group a member can issue (embedding a **human scale**)\n* requiring links to be copied and pasted after a certain number of re-shares (introducing **friction** to decisions)\n* capping the dominance of ‘extreme users’ (those who engage with the platform the most, often in anger and anxiety) in training the algorithm that influences what other users see (introducing a **mediating** factor)\n\nNotwithstanding Facebook’s recent offensive to claim the metaverse, this *is* a time for reworking the web. What began as information (Web1) and expanded into interactive content creation (Web2) is in desperate need of governance and civility. Some accountability can be achieved through code-verified decentralisation (Web3), but, even in a world where an individual’s human existence and their online actions and ownership can be proven by a 42-character Ethereum address, the public space of the web remains an under-realised and sad reflection of a community’s values.\n\n### Metaphor and analogy have value in helping the collective reworking of the web.\n\nMetaphor and analogy are methods of sense-making – ways of *framing and acting in the unknown* \\[2\\]. The practice of sense-making generates findings useful for others, outside of the case-specific or technical detail. Synthesising the explanation so that it makes sense to others has an *intersubjective* intention, that is it focuses on the capacity of people to understand each other. Sense-making is the application of discursive and relational techniques of communication; naming, distilling, abstracting and repackaging, including through stories and metaphors, continually redrafting the collective story and the ‘best available’ explanation.\n\n### Public space is a useful web analogy.\n\nEli Pariser is co-director of [New Public](https://newpublic.org/), a group with a mission to *understand what common characteristics make for “public-friendly” spaces, that valorise the collective and that are designed for the greater public good*. Much like Haugen, Pariser takes issue with the structure and governance of the web rather than the content. It’s not an information problem, it’s a problem of human relationships, trust, connection, the structures of the bonds that the information flows through. Pariser argues that the way platforms create online spaces should intentionally learn from urban spaces that are optimised for cooperation and connection. Cities are full of strangers interacting, often without danger. Pariser talks about the *civic signals* – those features that constitute the critical qualities of flourishing public spaces, and that ‘script’ human behaviours, both in real life and online \\[3\\]. Civic signals include the scale of public / online spaces, features that script behaviours and connections, the ‘soft’ architecture of programme, and governance, agency and ownership *(how and by whom are behaviours set?)*\n\n### My own job is in urban design. So here are four more urban renewal analogies through which to consider the web space:\n\n1. **Place activation**\n\n   Curated place activation brings public life to a place in its early evolution, before a critical mass of population ‘activates’ it organically. This includes everyday and night programme, seasonal events, and temporary programme that targets specific user groups within the community. Paid ‘place managers’ have a coordinating role, but the events themselves are decided through stakeholder engagement (within the community) and through expressions of interest by external partners. To accommodate this range the structure of public spaces should be simple and flexible rather than complex. For web, this analogy illuminates the role of planned activation rather than simply letting the space fill organically, especially in the early days of a platform / group / protocol.\n2. **Funding**\n\n   In urban renewal, those who benefit from the uplift in land value contribute financially to the upgrades required to support the growing population. For example, a residential tower development will pay a fee per apartment as a contribution to funding needed community infrastructure - parks, public spaces, street upgrades. For web, this analogy questions the mechanisms for contributing to and determining infrastructure priorities as a platform grows.\n3. **Safety, diversity, inclusion**\n\n   Universal Design is the design of places and products to ensure inclusion, regardless of ability. It is distinct from accessibility because inclusion is integrated from the outset. Universal Design is the welcoming address, not the ramp added on the side. Other measures of safety and inclusion in physical public spaces are the *social field* (a scale at which people can see other people - increasing perception of safety) and *walkability* (describing - obviously - distance plus environmental comfort). For web, these features can be analogies to consider details of scale, access, user experience that support expression and connection and limit danger.\n4. **Long term view**\n\n   Finally, there is the factor of time. Improving public space and safety is not wholesale reworking but long-term and incremental renewal by many hands that takes time. It’s an ongoing job, not something that can be fixed once, rebuilt, and then disregarded, it won’t ever be complete or perfect. But, as Haugen says, *we shouldn’t be afraid of trying to make a problem 80% better just because we can’t make it 100% better.*\n\n\\[1\\] Frances Haugen, 2021,  <https://www.franceshaugen.com/blog/b9xlswihkike7639nn4ie23odz9eqy>\n\n\\[2\\] Deborah Ancona, 2012, Sensemaking: Framing and acting in the unknown, in *The handbook for teaching leadership: Knowing, doing, and being,* Sage\n\n\\[3\\] New Public, 2021, *Civic Signals: The qualities of flourishing digital spaces*,  <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lO4skPVekwciJGFYxxJBIBitFzzDSC0zL1-AvhgfeNs/edit#slide=id.gaae01eb308_1_81>", "timestamp": 1636193407, "digest": "PcDYvJIhXdIK_e_MMpcD0MfeRAB0ja72_c2m1VXf8CE", "contributor": "0x5a13E93873A51Fcb8C6417e8A15D8111250d3B14"}

And how much? -\n\nMerck's molnupiravir has already been approved in the United Kingdom where health authorities on Thursday gave their green light to its use in patients at risk of developing a serious form of the illness, such as the elderly, obese people, or those suffering from diabetes.\n\nUS and EU health authorities are also urgently reviewing the drug.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency promised on Thursday to \"accelerate\" proceedings, without giving a firm date.\n\nSeveral countries have already ordered stocks of molnupiravir, such as the United States, with 1.7 million courses of the drug.\n\nThe US order gives an idea of the steep price of the drug.\n\nIt comes to $1.2 billion, which equates to around $700 for a five-day course.\n\nAs for Pfizer, while it has not outlined a price for paxlovid, it has promised it will be \"affordable\" and subject to a tiered pricing approach based on the income level of countries.\n\njdy/ito/fmp/gvy/mbx/ah\n", "timestamp": 1636194490, "digest": "liNy4b1kZbmg60-c9pk3zVVKTZehGSOfslWargTKvbw", "contributor": "0x5a3244eCAb65f3562b654d1f186B215DB17e5ef3"}

I don't think the recent price impact will be as huge as in 2017. I personally think that given China’s policies, the crackdown on BTC mining/trading activities, and the fear of price peaks at the time, these fundamental events led to massive selling and capital outflows. We might have been unable to hold 30,000 in the summer. The low of the dollar. The adjustment of the geographic distribution of BTC mining activities should be beneficial in the long run, because this activity tends to be more decentralized and dispersed to regions that are not subject to regulatory restrictions. If we see more policy decisions similar to El Salvador, this could be a major bullish catalyst. From a technical analysis point of view, the BTC price will hold the ~38,000-40,000 USD area and break the range high first. ~40,700 USD is the highest daily closing price of the three-month interval in summer. I think the low point is in place, but I won't be surprised if it dives to $36,000-37,000 at the beginning of the quarter. As long as our weekly closing price is not lower than the range high\r\n~42,000-43,000 U.S. dollars, I'm sure it will continue to rise in the next few months, and set a new record of all-time highs.\r\nrecord.\nEthereum has implemented the EIP-1559 proposal upgrade, and its next main catalyst is the main network and the beacon chain\r\nThe plan to merge and switch to the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism will be postponed to the second quarter of 2022, but it has become increasingly clear that ETH is the main currency of the Internet. You need ETH to buy NFT, trade on DEX, use all loan agreements to make deposits, etc. Although Ethereum faces competition from other L1s, what we see is that the overall user base of cryptocurrency continues to grow, not that ETH users leave Ethereum and switch to other L1s. The bottleneck of high gas fees is a major obstacle for retail investors to embrace Ethereum, but the development of L2 solutions is quickly solving this problem. Even without these L2 solutions, many long-term ETH users are already wealthy, and the gas fee is just a drizzle for them. From an investment point of view, other\r\nL1 does have more room for upside, but because their plates are smaller and they have undergone fewer practical tests, they need to take more risks to get more returns, but Ethereum will definitely not disappear anytime soon.

By connecting to Polkadot, its future-proof technology, and its engaged community of users with billions in value in liquidity, blockchain networks like Acala can access key requirements for a successful launch while focusing on building an ecosystem of high-value applications.\n\nWhile some startups might turn to private venture capital rounds to fund their launch and initial years of operation, Acala has instead chosen to incorporate the Crowdloan model to ensure a widespread, fair, and ethical distribution of its network ownership. By participating in the Crowdloan, supporters will receive Acala tokens (ACA), representing their share of the network.\n\nAnyone in the world can contribute to Acala’s crowdloan by loaning Polkadot (DOT) tokens. When the Crowdloan begins, participants simply lock their DOT in the Crowdloan vault. This is a “‘smart contract,” a virtual vault stored on the blockchain that is instructed by computer code to secure the loaned DOT for two years. It can never be touched by the Acala team. In return for their loans, contributors will receive Acala’s ACA token, giving them a share of the network. The amount of ACA is tied to the amount of DOT contributed and the total rewards allocated to the Crowdloan by Acala (see below).\n\nOnce the community has contributed DOT in support of Acala, Acala can bid with these DOT to win a slot on the network in the auction. After Acala wins a slot, the network will launch, and the newest DeFi platform will come to life. Then after two years, the smart contract opens the vault and automatically returns the DOT to their owners. All participants receive their original DOT and also retain the ACA tokens that they were gifted for their contributions.\n\n## **Discover the Acala Crowdloan Rewards**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*2Q-SlsGq-19mCP-CeejDWg.png)\n\n**Total ACA Crowdloan Rewards**: 17% of ACA supply (170,000,000 ACA): 15% base rewards + 2% for various bonuses\n\n**Total ACA Supply**: 1,000,000,000 ACA\n\n**Acala’s Parachain Slot Lease Duration**: 96 weeks (approx. 2 years)\n\n**Acala’s Parachain Slot Auction Batch**: Acala will bid for a slot in auction #1 with the goal of winning slot #1\n\n**Reward Distribution**: 100% of ACA will be distributed to users after network launch and token transfers having been enabled\n\n**Liquid, Transferable ACA**: 20% of ACA will be liquid and transferable\n\n**Locked, Vesting ACA**: the remainder of ACA will vest/unlock linearly (every block) over a 96 week period\n\n**Reward Calculation (excluding bonuses)**: (Your DOT Contribution / Total DOT Contributed to Acala) \\* 150,000,000 ACA\n\n**LCDOT Distribution** (for users using option 2 below): 100% of LCDOT will be distributed along with ACA rewards.

Going from working for a salary to contributing for an ownership stake is a powerful mental model.\n\nNFTs are about ownership, too. It's technology to solve digital ownership in a provable way.\n\nThe technology will have a massive impact on many things, but there are four primary use cases that I think we'll see play out over time.\n\nUnderstanding them is important to know why NFTs are a big deal:\n\n* Powering the creator economy\n* Owning digital assets\n* Create leverage from connecting ownership across the physical and digital world\n* Handling ownership in the physical world more efficiently\n\nLet’s get to it.\n\n## Powering the creator economy\n\nNFTs are already creating more efficient ways for creators to transact and interact with consumers (or fans).\n\n\nThis will continue to play out, at the expense of incumbent middlemen like record labels and book publishers.\n\n\nThe technology also enables previously impossible or near-impossible features, like establishing a revenue stream to creators from the royalties they can collect on secondary sales.\n\nNFTs also give creators a way to verify ownership and engage directly with their truest fans.\n\n## Owning digital assets\n\nCreator economy plus digital asset ownership is the cocktail we've got going right now. Artists and creators (primarily of visual art) are selling, and consumers are collecting.\nOwning digital assets will span broader than that, though; Especially as the vision of the metaverse plays out over time and our digital identities become more important to us.\n\n\nDigital assets will be stores of value and provide social capital and utility for us in the digital world.\n\n\nThe key unlock with NFTs is that they enable actual ownership: the digital assets you own are yours, and you can bring them in and out of platforms, products, and digital experiences to your liking.\n\n\nDigital asset ownership is a core component of the metaverse vision.\n\n## Connecting the physical and digital world\n\nConnecting what we do and what we have in the physical world with what we do and have in the digital world will become more important.\n\nFirst, when we end up with a tricked-out metaverse, we're still going to a big portion of our lives in the physical world (at least, I hope we do).\n\nStill, it makes complete sense that the identities and assets we own across the digital and physical worlds affect each other.\n\nThis will also be the first adapter for physical-world companies and brands to connect with and leverage the potential of web3.\n\nThe crossover will work both ways:\n\n* Something you own or did in the physical world affects your digital world\n* Something you own or did in the digital world will unlock something in the physical world\n\nWe've already seen the latter example play out during the big NFT conference in New York when Bored Ape Yacht Club-owners got access to parties, including a free The Strokes/Lil' Baby concert.\n\nIt's going to work the other way around, too. It takes more time because it depends on the companies still trying to figure out web3, NFTs, and blockchain.\n\n**We could see things like**\n\n* Going to see a movie during opening weekend unlocking virtual merch\n* Running a marathon gives you access to an exclusive, global runners club\n* Buying a Tesla and getting airdropped a limited edition and tradeable doodle by Elon Musk\n\n## Handling ownership in the physical world more efficiently\n\nNFTs enable verifiable proofs of ownership without depending on trusted third parties.\nWe will be able to handle ownership, transact and transfer ownership of physical items better than we currently do.\n\n\nIt will affect property deeds, capital goods, and items where provenance is important.\nTransferring this idea from private consumption to business use cases will play a huge role in supply chain logistics and sustainability projects in the future.\n\n\nSome of these use cases are already at work; some are on the cusp of going mainstream, while others will take some time.\n\nThey are also consecutive in that the current phase will prove the feasibility and potential of the next.", "timestamp": 1636201056, "digest": "l419LZwsIyP3JiyMVufbmzJ0yDzABwyHONYE4Noyw0w", "contributor": "0xd404B645C7fEf0BC3C8F4fff73Fcc61baC5296cF"}

Liquidity pools, collateralized crypto lending, and yield farming aren't familiar everyday terms that promote mass adoption.\n\nUnlike DeFi, which is still pretty advanced stuff to get into, NFTs are (often) visual and are a far easier concept to \"get.\" There's a close resemblance to the idea of digital asset ownership that's become familiar to many via Fortnite and other online games.\n\nLike everything else blockchain that gains traction, the NFT space is chaotic and moving fast. From generative art via tons of animal avatar series to *cryptodickbutts* (yeah – I know, but I still bought and sold several. Which is either very amusing, very sad or just a sign of peak hype…).\n\nContinuing, I'll assume you have some general idea of what NFT's are, and if not, I invite you to pause reading and simply Google \"What is an NFT?\".\n\n![cryptodickbutt wearing a Jester hat](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jDfFyLY-VQ0aCRDgCLnWK.png?height=600&width=600)\n\nAmong all the craziness, there’s one specific type of NFT-project that I find fascinating: those building towards a long-term vision of building the next generation of entertainment networks.\n\nA few weeks back, I tweeted this:\n\n> The next Disney will be a Metaverse-connected entity that's built bottoms-up via a strong community, where fans can become fractional owners of content, characters, and revenue.\n\nI have worked in the entertainment industry for years, and I’m convinced that what we see now is the beginning of a new way to create IP and generate value from it.\n\n## The Old Way\n\nDisney’s run with Marvel for the past 10+ years is a prime example of the current state of IP value creation; Movies, games, merchandise, theme park rides, and more. Top off with heavy marketing efforts.\n\nIt’s a top-down approach: the studio owns, creates, and pushes the content to the consumer, who pays the mula. The mula then moves through different value chain links, but the value *flows to the top*.\n\nThe model works well when you have an established intellectual property like the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nIt gets riskier when you’re starting from scratch. You have to make big investments up-front and build fan engagement after. It may work, or it may not. The problem is that you won’t know until you have spent a lot of cash.\n\nAt some point, even Disney will have to retire (or at least scale back) the MCU initiative in favor of something fresh. \n\n## The New Way\n\nSurely there must be a better way? Oh yes, The New Way: Building Exponential Entertainment Networks.\n\nThe current prime example is Pixel Vault, but other exciting projects like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, Cyber Kongz, and more follow the same path.\n\nPixel Vault is an entertainment group with a vision to create entertainment IP and build properties for it, much like Marvel/Disney has.\n\nPixel Vault has several projects in the works that all tie together. Their tentpole is the MetaHeroes: a superhero-infused universe, not so different from Marvel. There will be a game in the future, and there might be other properties (movies, comics, series, etc.).\n\n![My badass MetaHero from Mars](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i3PGHNa5yeXDtdFFzZmLj.png?height=1004&width=998)\n\nThe big difference between Disney and Pixel Vault is their starting point: they’re starting with *fan engagement first.*\n\nThe ultimate success metric is whether the content engages fans or not. Pixel Vault started solving the most important thing first and built “backward” from there.\n\nNow, how can they do that? By leveraging some of the fundamental components of web3 oriented products and services. Specifically, two important ones that's pretty tough to replicate for a legacy entertainment company:\n\n**Fan engagement through ownership**\n\nThere’s no MetaHero game or movie ready to play or watch yet. There are a bunch of characters that will play a vital role in the future MetaHero Universe. These characters are NFT’s that fans of the project have bought and own.\n\nFans can become investors in the Pixel Vault project via ownership of these characters and by owning a share of the Pixel Vault project itself or even by holding a share of one of the planets inside the universe.\n\nIt sounds crazy when compared to Disney, and it is. It’s also pretty fxcking awesome.\n\nOwning a piece of the game you play, the movie you watch, or one of the characters *in the movie* is next-level fan engagement.\n\nIt also unlocks another exciting component: revenue share. The different pieces of the universe (group ownership, character ownership, planet ownership) are entitled to share the revenue generated inside the ecosystem.\n\nIt also enables value to be distributed among fans, stakeholders, and the community, rather than solely flowing to the top and into the deep pockets of a select few owners.\n\nPixel Vault has raised several ten-million bags of dollars in funding by selling to the community investors. Funds they can now use to create the next phase of the entertainment network: properties (first: a game experience where the characters come to life).\n\n**Community-driven**\n\nSince community members are also owners, the project itself is community-directed to a certain degree.\n\nHow do we build the game? Partnering with a game studio? Acquiring a game studio? Building it in “in-house”? The community stakeholders take part in the process by voting.\n\nThis mechanic keeps the community continuously engaged with the long-term vision of the project.\n\nNow, this is all new terrain, and Pixel Vault still has a lot to prove. It’s an experiment in progress with a lot of room to fail. Still, if nobody tries, nobody succeeds.\n\nA few days ago, the project announced it had signed a deal with WME, one of the biggest talent agencies in Hollywood. That’s a pretty strong signal. Hollywood has already taken notice.\n\nI’m excited about the future of Pixel Vault and the playbook they’re writing on how to create future Exponential Entertainment Networks.\n\n*Disclaimer: I have invested in the Pixel Vault / Metahero project.*", "timestamp": 1636201745, "digest": "aQcSjEqhegYlMQmsfB2J6sJJ5wRX9XuUBBzjiXJXWwY", "contributor": "0xd404B645C7fEf0BC3C8F4fff73Fcc61baC5296cF"}
{"id": "uhtEN0NwJTDNN9VPbBWHrtqGULnyvMBaccIQ6aeGNUo", "title": "Why NFTs are a big deal", "body": "It's easy to get lost in the JPEG-mania of the NFT space and gloss over the real powers of the technology and why it is a big deal.\nA significant force that drives the wave of web3 is the concept of ownership. Going from working for a salary to contributing for an ownership stake is a powerful mental model.\n\nNFTs are about ownership, too. It's technology to solve digital ownership in a provable way.\n\nThe technology will have a massive impact on many things, but there are four primary use cases that I think we'll see play out over time.\n\nUnderstanding them is important to know why NFTs are a big deal:\n\n* Powering the creator economy\n* Owning digital assets\n* Create leverage from connecting ownership across the physical and digital world\n* Handling ownership in the physical world more efficiently\n\nLet’s get to it.\n\n## Powering the creator economy\n\nNFTs are already creating more efficient ways for creators to transact and interact with consumers (or fans).\n\n\nThis will continue to play out, at the expense of incumbent middlemen like record labels and book publishers.\n\n\nThe technology also enables previously impossible or near-impossible features, like establishing a revenue stream to creators from the royalties they can collect on secondary sales.\n\nNFTs also give creators a way to verify ownership and engage directly with their truest fans.\n\n## Owning digital assets\n\nCreator economy plus digital asset ownership is the cocktail we've got going right now. Artists and creators (primarily of visual art) are selling, and consumers are collecting.\nOwning digital assets will span broader than that, though; Especially as the vision of the metaverse plays out over time and our digital identities become more important to us.\n\n\nDigital assets will be stores of value and provide social capital and utility for us in the digital world.\n\n\nThe key unlock with NFTs is that they enable actual ownership: the digital assets you own are yours, and you can bring them in and out of platforms, products, and digital experiences to your liking.\n\n\nDigital asset ownership is a core component of the metaverse vision.\n\n## Connecting the physical and digital world\n\nConnecting what we do and what we have in the physical world with what we do and have in the digital world will become more important.\n\nFirst, when we end up with a tricked-out metaverse, we're still going to a big portion of our lives in the physical world (at least, I hope we do).\n\nStill, it makes complete sense that the identities and assets we own across the digital and physical worlds affect each other.\n\nThis will also be the first adapter for physical-world companies and brands to connect with and leverage the potential of web3.\n\nThe crossover will work both ways:\n\n* Something you own or did in the physical world affects your digital world\n* Something you own or did in the digital world will unlock something in the physical world\n\nWe've already seen the latter example play out during the big NFT conference in New York when Bored Ape Yacht Club-owners got access to parties, including a free The Strokes/Lil' Baby concert.\n\nIt's going to work the other way around, too. It takes more time because it depends on the companies still trying to figure out web3, NFTs, and blockchain.\n\n**We could see things like**\n\n* Going to see a movie during opening weekend unlocking virtual merch\n* Running a marathon gives you access to an exclusive, global runners club\n* Buying a Tesla and getting airdropped a limited edition and tradeable doodle by Elon Musk\n\n## Handling ownership in the physical world more efficiently\n\nNFTs enable verifiable proofs of ownership without depending on trusted third parties.\nWe will be able to handle ownership, transact and transfer ownership of physical items better than we currently do.\n\n\nIt will affect property deeds, capital goods, and items where provenance is important.\nTransferring this idea from private consumption to business use cases will play a huge role in supply chain logistics and sustainability projects in the future.\n\n\nSome of these use cases are already at work; some are on the cusp of going mainstream, while others will take some time.\n\nThey are also consecutive in that the current phase will prove the feasibility and potential of the next.", "timestamp": 1636201787, "digest": "l419LZwsIyP3JiyMVufbmzJ0yDzABwyHONYE4Noyw0w", "contributor": "0xd404B645C7fEf0BC3C8F4fff73Fcc61baC5296cF"}

(Wilfredo Lee / Associated Press)\n\nAs the Delta variant became the dominant strain of the coronavirus across the United States, all three COVID-19 vaccines available to Americans lost some of their protective power, with vaccine efficacy among a large group of veterans dropping between 35% and 85%, according to a new study.\n\nResearchers who scoured the records of nearly 800,000 U.S. veterans found that in early March, just as the Delta variant was gaining a toehold across American communities, the three vaccines were roughly equal in their ability to prevent infections.\n\nBut over the next six months, that changed dramatically.\n\nBy the end of September, Moderna’s two-dose COVID-19 vaccine, measured as 89% effective in March, was only 58% effective.\n\nThe effectiveness of shots made by Pfizer and BioNTech, which also employed two doses, fell from 87% to 45% in the same period.\n\nAnd most strikingly, the protective power of Johnson & Johnson's single-dose vaccine plunged from 86% to just 13% over those six months.\n\n[The findings](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm0620) were published Thursday in the journal Science.\n\nThe three vaccines held up better in their ability to prevent COVID-19 deaths, but by July — as the Delta variant began to drive a three-month surge of infections and deaths — the shots' effectiveness on that score also revealed wide gaps.\n\nAmong veterans 65 and older who were inoculated with the Moderna vaccine, those who developed a so-called breakthrough infection were 76% less likely to die of COVID-19 compared with unvaccinated veterans of the same age.\n\nOlder veterans who got the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and subsequently experienced a breakthrough infection were 70% less likely to die than were their unvaccinated peers.\n\nAnd when older vets who got a single jab of the J\\&J vaccine suffered a breakthrough infection, they were 52% less likely to die than their peers who didn't get any shots.\n\nFor veterans younger than 65, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines provided the best protection against a fatal case of COVID-19, at 84% and 82%, respectively. When younger veterans inoculated with the J\\&J vaccine suffered a breakthrough infection, they were 73% less likely to die of COVID-19 than were their unvaccinated peers.\n\nJohnson & Johnson representatives did not immediately respond to requests to discuss the study's findings.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended booster shots for [everyone who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2021-10-15/fda-panel-takes-up-tough-questions-on-j-j-covid-19-boosters) at least two months earlier.\n\n[Boosters are also recommended](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2021-10-23/its-ok-to-mix-and-match-covid-19-booster-shoots-which-one-should-i-get) six months after a second dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines for everyone 65 and older; those with medical conditions that make them more vulnerable to a serious case of COVID-19; those who live in nursing homes or other group settings; and those who live or work in high-risk settings such as hospitals or prisons.\n\nIn addition, all people with compromised immune systems are advised to get a booster shot if it's been at least 28 days since their vaccine took full effect.\n\nWith millions of vaccinated Americans pondering whether they need a boost, the new study offers the most comprehensive comparison yet of how the three vaccines have performed across the nation this year.\n\nIt tracked 780,225 veterans of the U.S. armed forces from Feb. 1 to Oct. 1. Close to 500,000 of them had been vaccinated, while just under 300,000 had not.\n\nHailing from across the country, all were cared for by the Department of Veterans Affairs' unified system, which provides healthcare to 2.7% of the U.S. population. While the group under study was ethnically and racially diverse, the record-keeping that researchers relied upon was uniform.\n\nBecause these were veterans, the study population comprised six times as many men as women. And they skewed older: about 48% were 65 or older, 29% were between 50 and 64, and 24% were younger than 50.\n\nThough older veterans were more likely to die than younger vets throughout the study period, the decline of the vaccines’ protection against illness and death was seen in both young and old.\n\nThe study was conducted by a team from the Public Health Institute in Oakland, the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San Francisco, and the University of Texas Health Science Center.\n\n[Dr. Barbara Cohn](https://www.phi.org/experts/barbara-cohn/), the study's lead author, said in addition to its comparison of COVID-19 vaccines, the group's analysis provides \"a lens for making informed decisions around primary vaccination, booster shots, and other multiple layers of protection.\" That includes mask mandates, coronavirus testing and other public health measures aimed at countering viral spread.\n\nStrong evidence of the vaccines' declining power should prompt even states and locales with highly vaccinated populations to consider retaining mask mandates, the authors said. And the findings strongly support the CDC's recent recommendation that all recipients of the J\\&J vaccine get a booster.\n\nThe study concluded that the Delta variant, which drove a wave of infections and deaths across the country over the spring and summer, was probably the factor that most eroded the protection of vaccines.\n\nOther researchers have found [similar evidence ](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2021-10-04/pfizer-covid-vaccine-waning-not-deltas-fault)of declining vaccine effectiveness. But they have suggested that the immune system’s defenses against SARS-CoV-2 simply fade with time, and that waning vaccine effectiveness would probably have been seen with or without the arrival of a new, [more transmissible strain](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2021-07-30/why-does-covid-19-delta-variant-spread-so-easily).\n\nThis story originally appeared in [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2021-11-04/study-shows-dramatic-decline-in-effectiveness-of-covid-19-vaccines).\n", "timestamp": 1636206395, "digest": "rB0nTxzN91bc-tShVxGxhZrhTB9SKeMM84Z-tVPrx1c", "contributor": "0xC54284513d0a1D649197D4d80b97a244aA3DDbD1"}

He believes that many people are wrong about the meta universe. He believes that the meta universe is not a virtual place, but a moment. It is a moment when digital life is more valuable than physical life. This is not a change overnight, but a gradual change that has taken place for 20 years.\n\n1. First: everyone is wrong about the meta universe.\n\nMost people think that the \"meta universe\" is a virtual place. Just like the movie \"number one player\", or a virtual world, as minecraft, roblox or Zuckerberg showed in a Facebook presentation.\n\nBut what if it's not a place?\n\n1. Second: the meta universe is not a place, but time.\n\nTime? Yes, for a moment.\n\nDo you know that there is a concept of \"singularity\" in artificial intelligence? This is the moment when artificial intelligence becomes smarter than humans. Artificial intelligence > the moment of human intelligence\n\n1. Third: what is the meta universe?\n\nThe meta universe is a time when our digital life is more valuable than our physical life. This is not a change overnight, or some Steve Jobs type of invention.\n\nIt is a gradual change that has taken place for 20 years.\n\n1. Every important part of life is going digital.\n\nWork -- > from factories to laptops. Turn the meeting room to zoom.\n\nFriends -- > from neighbors to fans. Where did you find like-minded people? Twitter, reddit, etc\n\nGames -- > more children play fortress night than basketball and football combined.\n\n1. The identity -- > filter is a new component. A story is your personal billboard to promote your identity.\n\nWhat do you look like in real life? Or what you look like on instagram? Which is more important.\n\nThe picture on the left is what they see, so it's important.\n\nwXV83VxcpQ8h8Q0vbTTz084raIGijMsw3FztzV6S.png\n\n1. Everything is digital. Your friends, your job, your identity.\n\nNow with cryptocurrency, your assets are online.\n\nThe boring monkey is the new Rolex. Fortnite skin is the new skinny jeans.\n\nIf everyone has been wandering online, your activities need to be digitized.\n\n1. Therefore, if you look forward 10 to 20 years, we will enter the meta universe.\n\nThe digital world is more important to us than the physical world. We used to focus 99% of our attention on our physical environment.\n\nTV dropped to 85%, computer dropped to 70% and mobile phone dropped to 50%\n\n1. Our attention has shifted from entities to numbers.\n\nWhere attention is, energy is.\n\nIf 50% of our attention is on our digital screen, then 50% of our energy will be spent on our digital life.\n\nToday, taking out the mobile phone from your pocket requires some action.\n\n1. Soon, some companies will make smart glasses in front of us all day.\n\nWe will increase from 50% screen attention to more than 90%.\n\nThat's when the meta universe began. Because at that moment, our virtual life will become more important than our real life.\n\n1. Is this a good thing or a bad thing?\n\nLike anything, it is neither good nor bad. It's just one thing.\n\nVery different things.", "timestamp": 1636206566, "digest": "2NCWBezdKSnT5CsWwyT230zfnQIiblqYpympgZqqNfU", "contributor": "0x6688E117972d5419D9ae810284A0CcA3A77ea60A"}

One day, I saw some creators singing in the program. They came to the studio in their best Sunday clothes. They wiped their shoes, made their hair, put on CK or Chanel 5 perfume, and sang their own voice: \"the cry of inspiration\".\n\nI watched each contestant sing carefully. About halfway through the performance, a small box popped up under the TV screen.\n\nDid you see? Voice of America has been promoting the social media accounts of its most valuable singers for about three seconds.\n\nThis is the first time this has happened.\n\nPreviously, there was only one description below each singer's YouTube video, and there was no link to the singer's website. On the program's website, each contestant had a singer profile before. Even so, there is no link to the singer's website. Now these personal data are no longer on the program website.\n\nCreators have been sealed up for several years, and we let monopolies hurt them.\n\nWeb 3.0 transformation\n\nWeb 1.0: Internet\n\nWeb 2.0: social media / mobile Internet\n\nWeb 3.0: blockchain / AI\n\nWe are in the third stage of the Internet. Many Web 3.0 skeptics believe that decentralization will not change anything. I disagree.\n\nBrian Armstrong, chief executive of coinbase, believes that Web 3.0 is nothing new. He said that we are re centralizing the Internet, that is, what was the Internet like at first and why?\n\nHe said we need to \"test the power of large technology companies\" because many countries are excluded from the creator's economic prosperity. Ask creators like my friend Chinedu in Africa. It's hard for them to make a profit through paypal and stripe. However, people like me have always taken this for granted. The luck of your birthplace should not affect whether you can join the creator economy and make a living.\n\nCreativity is not limited by the country of origin. Web 2.0 makes us think it is.\n\n\"Conversion rate\" explains the exploitation of creators.\n\nSocial media platforms like Twitter, instagram and tiktok have 100% conversion rates - they don't share any revenue with creators at all! This is good for them, but bad for users—— Chris Dixon\n\nHere I'll correct Dixon further. Before CEO Jack Dorsey saw the power of Web 3.0, twitter never shared revenue with its creators, and now he's back on the road. He publicly announced that he would decentralize twitter and turn it into a Web 3.0 product. In addition, Twitter has just launched a \"super follow\" feature that allows creators to make money from content.\n\nIn addition, there is a new evue newsletter r feature that allows creators to charge for paid newsletters. That's not all. Recently launched the best features. Twitter has now opened its cryptocurrency service. You can use bitcoin to transfer money on twitter. For example, if you have ever tried to send money from the United States to El Salvador, this is the new rule of the game. Twitter has proved that the migration to Web 3.0 will occur 100%, albeit slowly.\n\nHowever, Facebook, instagram and tiktok have not yet understood this shift. They let content creators work like slaves. The creator builds followers and gets a view controlled by an algorithm that determines whether you like your Hoodie color tomorrow. They use this content to attract consumers and display advertisements to them. $0 of advertising revenue will be shared with creators. Please read it again.\n\nWhen content platforms first appeared, we were just happy to use them without spending a penny. Now we are used to it. Our standards have changed. Creators want to share the benefits of the platform from our content fairly. This is reasonable. But change will not happen unless Zuckerberg is forced to sell advertising and share revenue instead of buying another house.\n\nIf creators no longer provide content for free, platforms like tiktok will go bankrupt. Please imagine.\n\nPlatform ownership is broken\n\nHow is Web 3.0 different? Ownership. Creators want to own the platform they create and have the right to vote. When the platform makes money, they will also make money.\n\nA content audit policy is formed through voting rights. It is completed through the process of blockchain consensus and forced trust by thousands of computers around the world (even an orange president cannot affect the blockchain election).\n\nIn addition, there are the functions of the platform itself. Have you ever opened your favorite application on a beautiful Saturday afternoon and found that everything has changed. It looks like it was designed by a freshman UI / UX child? Do you feel like you didn't see the design punch you in the face? It's not the child's fault. They are too far from the work of the creator. They are outsiders.\n\nWeb 3.0 is different. Functions are determined by the user through democratic procedures. If a group of users don't like it, they create a fork. Bifurcation refers to running two versions of the same platform with different characteristics.\n\nWhen ownership is fixed and transparent, motivation changes. Ownership will lead to user democracy, rather than an authoritarian philosophy similar to Web2.0. \"This is the latest update, you dirty animal.\"\n\nSmart contracts contributed to this revolution\n\nEarly 21st century: make a website.\n\n2010s: developing applications.\n\n1920s: deploy smart contracts.\n\nMany people misunderstand Ethereum's role in the new creator economy. Ethereum allows machines, not humans, to execute smart contracts.\n\nEntrepreneur Mike Novogratz explained: \"blockchain will allow information not to be free, not free.\" remember Napster? You can download music for free. No one can stop you, even the fool of the metal band.\n\nThe Web 2.0 version of the Internet we are using is not built for content ownership. You can take any video from YouTube if you want. It's hard to detect. Hell, this article is easy to copy, paste and steal.\n\nSmart contracts change that. Smart contracts tell everyone who owns this content. The creativity of NFT is to make your content a portable digital asset so that you can publish it anywhere on the Internet.\n\nAccording to the expert Eric Jorgenson, the Web3.0 era is coming only because of the differences in these three aspects:\n\nWeb1 = free publishing\n\nWeb2 = free communication\n\nWeb3 = free transaction\n\nMore profitable ways\n\nNow that Web 3.0 solves the problem of content ownership and makes our digital assets portable, we as creators can find more ways to make money.\n\nMike Novogratz said that we will \"see a shift from businessmen to creativity\". Creators will have ways to monetize their creativity. Not just artistic creativity, but all kinds of creativity.\n\nHe even said that we will wear NFTs on T-shirts. Only by wearing AR / VR glasses can others see them.\n\nYou can share your money with many parties. You can transfer your content from one platform to another according to which platform is better. Creators from all over the world will be able to work together and come up with crazy ways to make money from our work.\n\nWhen Zach became rich, he no longer had to make $0 on Facebook. According to the performance of the content, money can flow into your pocket by seconds.\n\nCreators will accelerate the development of Web 3.0 because we just want to be paid so that we can engage in creation full-time. Once the content captors release us, more ways to make money will drown our creative brain. I can't wait.\n\nWeb 3.0 has changed every major industry\n\nEth: decentralized Silicon Valley\n\nDefi: decentralized Wall Street\n\nNFTs: decentralized Hollywood\n\nThis shift is not unique to the creator economy. All industries will slowly change to reflect human obsession with democracy. Web 3.0 first aims at finance and has become an industry of more than $2 trillion. This shift has shifted to the creator economy. Platforms such as bitclout invented coins, allowing creators to become their users so that they can invest in stocks.\n\nThe next wave of decentralization will be youtube, spotify and Facebook. Now is the best time to be part of the creator economy. Observe the transformation in front of you and migrate any content type you like to Web 3.0. This is how you, as a creator, can take advantage of this great opportunity.", "timestamp": 1636206742, "digest": "tp3X_5UA08jp_ZE1odXz_VjFEFBRFfiUzfYJz7JpOWY", "contributor": "0x5E06CA9A900c85feeB0EAc448b2C579206E8B466"}

{"id": "hkNlwM-iVhNbUB04MTCHjEM9aiN_CjQmlsDpR4vtrm4", "title": "Read Tencent blockchain", "body": "Tencent has made many attempts in the direction of blockchain. The group has integrated the blockchain into a single business line, such as Tencent security, Tencent cloud and its Weizhong bank.\n\nHowever, when it comes to Tencent's blockchain, the most direct business is Tencent blockchain. In this article, we will sort out relevant materials of Tencent blockchain. You can use these materials to feel the boundary between Tencent blockchain and other blockchain businesses.\n\nTencent blockchain is an autonomous and controllable blockchain infrastructure that can build safe and efficient solutions for business scenarios. Build value connectors for enterprises and institutions to jointly promote the development of value Internet.\n\nThe overall application framework of Tencent blockchain adheres to the distributed, weak center and self-organization spirit of blockchain, weakens the dependence of each node on centralized facilities in the process of business development as much as possible, and can solve the problem of the whole life cycle of application from front to back.\n\nIn terms of technical implementation, the overall application of Tencent blockchain can be divided into four layers: blockchain basic service layer, industry application service layer, business logic presentation layer and alliance governance layer.\n\nAmong them, the blockchain basic service layer, industry application service layer and business logic presentation layer belong to the category of node software, which should be deployed on their own nodes and belong to the private facilities of alliance members; The alliance governance layer belongs to the public facilities of the alliance and should be deployed on the neutral node of the Alliance Committee. At present, it is more appropriate to be operated by the blockchain technology service provider to facilitate subsequent software upgrading and maintenance.\n\nIn terms of products, Tencent blockchain mainly includes baas and trustsql.\n\nBaas mainly provides merchant registration, chain, node information query, and some chain operations. After merchant registration is successful, you can obtain organization ID, chain information, etc. through baas, which is the necessary information for subsequent interface services.\n\nTrustsql is the underlying service of Tencent blockchain. It mainly provides transaction insertion, transaction query and other operations. Users can directly develop this layer, but the difficulty will increase a lot. In order to better enable users to quickly access Tencent blockchain, trustsql provides upper interface encapsulation, mainly including digital asset service and shared information service. These two services provide rest style interfaces for convenient access.\n\nDigital asset services, shared information services and trustsql services are decentralized. They are deployed to nodes in the form of images and controlled by operation permissions. Users can close and open interfaces according to their own needs.\n\nBaas platform architecture\n\nBaas open platform is positioned as an enterprise blockchain application open platform provided by Tencent blockchain. Customers can use the test chain for service testing or build their own exclusive alliance chain. The overall architecture design of baas open platform is divided into two parts: chain management platform and node management platform.\n\nThe chain management platform is responsible for building the chain and managing the chain, nodes and members, without involving business logic and reading and writing data.\n\nThe node management platform, deployed locally, can help users manage data and business logic, and has the functions of user public key management and blockchain browser.\n\nThe chain management platform manages the alliance chain dimension, focuses on management functions, and provides baas level function APIs for calling, without involving business data on nodes. Chain owners and participants can register on the baas platform to view and manage the alliance chains they have created or participated in.\n\nThe node management platform manages node dimensions, focuses on business functions, and provides node level function APIs deployed on each node for calling (digital assets, shared ledger) and blockchain browser. The owner of a node can log in to its own node management platform to view and manage its own nodes and data on the chain.\n\nIn addition, Tencent blockchain provides two types of interface services: baas level functional interface and node level functional interface, which are used to complete management and business functions.\n\nIn order to further simplify the interface docking of the application platform, it is also equipped with an SDK development package, which encapsulates functions such as public-private key pair generation, address generation, signature, signature verification, encryption and decryption, and provides support in Java and C + +, which is convenient for business developers to use directly.\n\nBaas level function\n\nBaas level function interface is mainly used for chain management and private key hosting services, including:\n\n(1) In the blockchain browser interface, the \"obtain the information of the chain through the node\" interface and the \"obtain the information of the chain and nodes on the chain\" interface;\n\n(2) Tencent public key infrastructure (tpki) interface;\n\nNode level functional interface\n\nThrough the image file, it is deployed locally on the user node. It is mainly used to include:\n\n(1) Digital asset service interface;\n\n(2) Shared information service interface;\n\n(3) The interface of \"obtaining transaction information through block height\" in the blockchain browser interface;\n\nInterface design idea\n\nTrustsql application platform interface includes two application scenarios: digital assets and information sharing, and interfaces for other scenarios will be launched in the later stage. The interface design follows the following ideas:\n\n(1) The private keys of institutions and institutional users are recommended to be saved by users themselves, and the platform also provides hosting services.\n\n(2) The interface interaction process of digital assets is divided into two steps: application and submission. The two steps can be completed only by calling the interface of the same node. Application is to request the generation of a string to be signed, and submission is to submit a signature for confirmation, except for the query interface.\n\n(3) The information sharing interface supports submission without signature parameters. At this time, the interface will return the string to be signed. The user can generate a signature according to the string to be signed and submit again.\n\nAlliance chain creation process\n\nThe alliance chain creation process mainly includes four steps: creating a new alliance chain, adding nodes, inviting members and starting an alliance chain. You can operate according to the process prompts when creating an alliance chain.\n\nThe new alliance chain mainly completes the naming and description of the alliance chain.\n\nAdding nodes is mainly to add various participants to the alliance chain, and an alliance chain needs at least four nodes to participate in it. At present, there are three ways to add nodes: purchase nodes, add associated nodes, and associate existing Tencent cloud machines.\n\nThe invited members are mainly the ability of the initiator of the alliance chain to invite other participants in the chain to enter the alliance chain. When the initiator invites other institutions to enter the alliance chain, it can be divided into two categories according to whether the invitee needs to bring its own nodes to enter the alliance chain: allocation nodes and its own nodes.\n\nAt least 4 nodes are required to start a federation chain. When this condition is met, a federation chain can be started and run.\n\nBasic process of digital asset service (taking asset issuance as an example):\n\n1. The user registers on the baas platform and obtains the organization ID after successful registration.\n2. Upload the public key of the institution on the baas interface. The public key is used for signature verification, and the corresponding private key is used for encryption by the communicating party. It is recommended to save the private key. Baas also provides private key hosting service.\n3. Creating a new alliance chain involves associating with Tencent cloud, purchasing machines, entering node information, starting the alliance chain, and obtaining the chain ID after success.\n4. Application for digital asset issuance.\n5. Digital asset issuance submission.\n\nBasic process of shared information service (taking new shared information as an example):\n\n1.

{"id": "Nab8B4PPh2vwunueMz43qF-YAF0QVlmIzA5cPtMCI6g", "title": "NFT art auction observation: return to rationality and original intention in ups and downs", "body": "I believe history will always remember 2021. This year, the NFT works of encryption artist beeple sold at Christie's, making NFT popular all over the world overnight. It not only swept the art field, but also jumped into the mainstream vision and became a hot topic in society.\n\nLast week, Christie's announced that beeple would take his first physical work human one to the Christie's studio again and shoot it in New York on the evening of November 9. Since this auction will be beeple's first return after every day: the first 5000 days, it is estimated that it will attract more than $15 million in bids, which has attracted unprecedented attention and pressure from artists to auction houses. Noah Davis, head of digital art and online sales at Christie's, said that after a record breaking auction, \"any artist will face pressure to surpass himself\".\n\nPressure is not without reason. After beeple, many large traditional auction houses (Christie's, Sotheby's and Fuyis) have quickly accepted NFT art transactions and dug up more NFT works with collection value for collectors to buy. So far, four of the top ten high priced NFT works have been sold through traditional auction houses, indicating that even in this most advanced and cutting-edge technology field, the excellent reputation guarantee of traditional platforms is still very important for sellers.\n\nHowever, at present, many popular encryption art works have reached sky high prices. When more new buyers want to rush into the market, does their purchase preference change? In the face of the constantly fluctuating NFT market, are artists and auction houses still full of confidence? Entering the autumn auction season this year, maybe we can see where the wind is blowing in the NFT art auction market.\n\nNFT artist Andreas Ivan collaborated with the auction house for the first time to exhibit his 16 \"smoochies\". Source: Poly Hong Kong\n\nReturn to Rationality: the works of new artists with reasonable prices are popular\n\nAt the end of May and the beginning of June this year, the first global NFT encryption art exhibition was held in Shanghai, presenting the outstanding works of 27 top digital artists at home and abroad. In the list of artists as famous as beeple and Pak, the name of artist Andreas Ivan is impressively listed. In the middle of this year, Singapore's business times selected the Millennium generation Asian encryption artist with the highest income, and Andreas Ivan, a rising star, was also included.\n\nAndreas Ivan may not be familiar to most domestic audiences, but he is no stranger to China. In fact, Andreas of Russian and Mauritian descent was born in Russia but worked in China for a long time. He is the co-founder of a creative agency in Beijing. He revealed to the 21st Century Business Herald that at first he started NFT creation through the introduction of a friend toomuchlag who started playing NFT very early. So far, he is still very grateful for this unintentional experience, which makes him a part of witnessing this historical moment. \"It was my friend who shared with me the rising art revolution that gave me the opportunity to enter the market at its early stage of development.\"\n\nFortunately, Andreas's first NFT work, a short animation cycle called \"Dali dream\", was sold to NFT collector matrix at the price of 1.66 eth (ether, about 49000 yuan). Matrix is known as a famous collector who is good at discovering blue chip artists in the circle. Therefore, Andreas was soon regarded as a potential star and attracted wide attention in the industry. At present, this work is also being sold at an amazing high price of 22 eth (about 650000 yuan) in the secondary market.\n\nSimilar to digital art works such as cryptopunks and the boring ape Club (bayc), Andreas's most influential work is also a surreal character living in the meta universe, named \"smoochies\". Smoochies series is composed of cute 3D cartoon characters with plump lips like ready to kiss. Each has a carefully rendered appearance (such as Audrey Hepburn, Harry Potter and Bruce Lee), and has its own name and special story setting. The creation origin of smoochies series can be traced back to 2016. Since Andreas's mother lives thousands of miles away from him in Mauritius, he began to create \"this love letter to his mother\". \"Every time I feel sad, my mother will come to me, kiss my forehead and tell me that everything will be all right. Her lips are the shape of smoochies lips,\" he told reporters\n\nAndreas once said that he would only launch 100 smoochies in his creative career. After launching the first 36 smoochies at the beginning of this year, they were sold on the Ethereum blockchain platform at a record price, becoming the NFT series with the highest sales record in Asia at that time. Last month, poly Hong Kong auction announced the first NFT special exhibition and online auction, in which the personal special part is Andreas's \"smoochies: m Æ tertiary\". He created 16 smoochies for the exhibition again, and the number of members of the smoochies series has reached 52. The exhibition also printed 8 physical prints for each smoochies for the first time, and all physical prints were sold out soon after the opening. His NFT works will be open for auction from November 8 to 12.\n\nBut Andreas's popularity does not depend solely on \"limited supply\" or luck bonus. According to the newly released hiscox online art transaction report in 2021, NFT art collectors have changed from following the trend of buying sky high priced works to more rationally explore the works of new encrypted artists with reasonable price and appreciation potential. \"Perhaps critics will think that art itself is insignificant, but the combination of uniqueness, ownership, Gamification and storytelling is driving a new generation of collectors and investors to trade,\" the report said\n\nThe explosive NFT boom at the beginning of this year made people only pay attention to the works of certain famous artists, such as beeple, Pak, etc. then their works were sold at a sky high price, which was higher than most people's tolerance. Therefore, as people gradually return to the essence of NFT art as a digital art enabled by science and technology, the \"code generation art\" (such as crypto punks and smoochies) with personality and story connotation can attract the interest of collectors in the long run.\n\nAuction line upgrade: high participation supplemented by technical blessing\n\nAt the beginning of this year, NFT officially entered the traditional auction industry. However, in order to follow the trend, most auction houses basically sell hot second-hand NFT, and less really participate in exploring the artistic value of NFT. With the demand of collectors returning to more rational art appreciation from the lively blind pursuit of buying, auction houses have simply provided popular auctions and systems for digital currency trading from the beginning, and gradually returned to looking for digital works of art with long-term investment and collection value for collectors.\n\nPoly Hong Kong recently announced to jointly hold the first NFT special exhibition and online auction with the authority, which is an official announcement of poly Hong Kong's joining the NFT art auction group. Whether it is Andreas's personal special session or the digital artist group exhibition of \"are you bound or not?\", poly Hong Kong has been highly involved in it since the selection of artists. They worked with artists to find valuable perspectives, discuss curatorial matters, and bring a series of NFT works tailored for the exhibition. The degree of investment is really high.\n\nA high degree of investment comes from full confidence. Although the overall trend of NFT art trading market still fluctuates recently, Zhang Yixiu, general manager of poly Hong Kong Auction Co., Ltd., is still very optimistic about the prospect of NFT art. He told the 21st Century Business Herald reporter: \"NFT art is a new blue ocean, so both artists and collectors have high expectations. Although it is really very different from the traditional art field, it is mostly limited (market) I'm confused about its digital nature, but I believe this will be gradually overcome under the development of science and technology. For example, we didn't know the development of smart phones ten years ago, so I'm very confident in the future. \"\n\nAlthough in the eyes of most people, NFT starts with blockchain, digital currency and other elements, it seems to be a new product of \"another dimension\". However, for auction houses, NFT art is essentially an emerging art type with technology addition. Like other art categories, there is no need to overemphasize its investment value. He pointed out: \"This emerging art field is like any kind of investment, which complements the investment of funds. But NFT art, driven by cryptocurrency and blockchain, will not generate disputes about authenticity or ownership of traditional art products. Therefore, collectors at any stage can invest directly without burden. I don't think NFT art needs to be too complicated.\"\n\nAccording to Zhang Yixiu, pricing NFT works of art is actually similar to the pricing rules for general works of art. It still takes the artist's experience, the work itself, and the past price level as a reference. After completing the pricing, formulate publicity and promotion strategies that can be better understood by collectors according to the digital form of NFT art itself. He told reporters: \"In this exhibition, we have exhibited prints for artists' solo digital works. On the one hand, we hope that collectors can better cut in from the perspective of physical collection, on the other hand, we can also make collectors look forward to the future NFT art online auction.\"\n\nThe authority, an art, culture and Technology Incubation Platform, has long focused on the promotion of new media art and blockchain art. As the technical partner of poly Hong Kong NFT's first exhibition, its founder sun Kangqiao pointed out the \"resource fill\" requirements of traditional auctions for technology companies in the blockchain field. He told the 21st Century Business Herald: \"A highly developed civilization will realize a high degree of virtualization and digitization. We are about to usher in a future dominated by digital assets. The high integration of virtual and reality in the future means that virtual assets must be endowed with rights and interests in the future society and injected with values equal to or greater than those of physical assets.\"\n\nHe stressed that in the future, large-scale commercial use of NFT will blossom everywhere. However, in the planning of NFT by traditional auctions, many experts in auction houses know art very well, but do not necessarily know the trend of blockchain or encryption market. Therefore, \"we hope that this cooperation will bring a positive impact on the Asian NFT art market and improve the status of blockchain technology and digital art in the art world.\"", "timestamp": 1636206805, "digest": "Byywe0xNWI-SimCHe67JtxS769suNqAJpYLaWC4eTW4", "contributor": "0x44e7D23d6eDca23E145F1Cf54fb46627aD8863eD"}

{"id": "SBzKly1zXlSjT3k8xiZg1bL-C2GtwIXY8A7z0YwCSm0", "title": "just for justice", "body": "Justice, in its broadest sense, is the principle that people receive that which they deserve, with the interpretation of what then constitutes \"deserving\" being impacted upon by numerous fields, with many differing viewpoints and perspectives, including the concepts of moral correctness based on ethics, rationality, law, religion, equity and fairness. The state will sometimes endeavour to increase justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings.\n\nConsequently, the application of justice differs in every culture. Early theories of justice were set out by the Ancient Greek philosophers Plato in his work The Republic, and Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics. Throughout history various theories have been established. Advocates of divine command theory have said that justice issues from God. In the 1600s, philosophers such as John Locke said that justice derives from natural law. Social contract theory said that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone. In the 1800s, utilitarian philosophers such as John Stuart Mill said that justice is based on the best outcomes for the greatest number of people. Theories of distributive justice study what is to be distributed, between whom they are to be distributed, and what is the proper distribution. Egalitarians have said that justice can only exist within the coordinates of equality. John Rawls used a social contract theory to say that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness. Robert Nozick and others said that property rights, also within the realm of distributive justice and natural law, maximizes the overall wealth of an economic system. Theories of retributive justice say that wrongdoing should be punished to insure justice. The closely related restorative justice (also sometimes called \"reparative justice\") is an approach to justice that focuses on the needs of victims and offenders.", "timestamp": 1636208620, "digest": "ubp82K3wEoL9vHF6NDzq2-oc-AmJmpzLkhucDLSi9wY", "contributor": "0xC07aD7Fc01304B4A2850b67f1F05A206fc690dd6"}

Many wealth-building assets have become increasingly inaccessible (e.g. property), remained stubbornly illiquid (e.g. start-up equity) or left unrecognised by lenders as collateral, therefore reducing opportunities for leverage. \n\nIt’s across these three areas of **Access**, **Liquidity** and **Leverage**, that I get most excited and where we’re actively investing at Mouro Capital.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aje_ggAtdpLw418A4Ca0K.png?height=541&width=1385)\n\n", "timestamp": 1636209914, "digest": "y5Yk5ppG-oKvjGRdM1XsJ8ccPUUWvdJ1hr50piZn--0", "contributor": "0x3e3e1Eb3489205747679b26c4092AcBa17b7cD78"}

SDK、IBC（跨链通信协议）。\n\n*   Tendermint共识算法——Cosmos网络使用一种通用区块链开发框架，在此框架下开发的区块链网络都具有共同算法，数据格式相同且可互通。早在2014年，研发团队就意识到比特币和以太坊的PoW（工作量证明）共识算法存在不足，希望能创造一种不依赖于挖矿这种高电力消耗的共识算法，且这种新算法能在保证网络安全的前提下，提升链上的处理速度和可扩展性。Tendermint框架专门形成了相应的软件，这个软件能够帮助网络复制应用程序，并保障应用程序的安全和数据的一致性。\n\n<!---->\n\n*   CosmosSDK——它是Cosmos为开发者提供的开发模板工具，它把区块链中的一些通用开发技术标准化、模块化，开发者只需在模板（SDK）基础上进行调整或更换部分内容，即可完成一条链的开发。Cosmos SDK的目标是希望开发者能轻松地构建和自定义区块链。难得的是，Cosmos SDK支持开发者构建多种PoS（权益证明）共识算法的区块链网络，开发者可以根据自己的需求定制Cosmos-SDK模块，然后将模块内容导入新生的区块链应用中，与原有的网络模块融为一体。我们所熟知的稳定币生态Terra（LUNA）和跨链资产交易应用Torchain（RUNE）都是基于Cosmos-SDK工具开发的。\n*   跨链通信协议IBC （Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol）—它是Cosmos网络核心协议接口，通过它能够实现区块网络链与链之间的信息传递，允许区块链读取和验证其它链上的数据。Cosmos生态内的多条区块链之间的联系即通过IBC同步。\\\n    例如：A链和B链之间有IBC接口，A链上的智能合约就可以知道B链上发生的数据事实，而B链上的智能合约需要采用A链上存储区块信息的块头，并验证其数据和时间的最终性。近期，Terra链社区出现了关于上线IBC的提案。如果Terra链最终上线了IBC接口，那么，Terra链上的LUNA、稳定币UST、ANC等资产及相关数据信息就可以无缝移植到Cosmos链上。\n\nCosmos网络的运转机制\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211102/587241116c524b6b83e47293c102b44c_GY2DAKRUGA.png)\n\n相较于以太坊这样的单独的区块链链条，Cosmos 正在构建由多链条组成的链网体系，在这里，新区块链可以轻易创建，每条链的共识算法都统一为Tendermint共识，各个链独立并行运转，通过IBC来实现链上资产在不同链之间的转移。\n\nCosmos提出一种设想——每个DApp都运行在自己的区块链上，而Cosmos通过协议来连接所有这些链及链上应用，然后形成「区块链互联网」。\n\n在Cosmos生态中到底如何实现链与链之间的信息共享呢？运转方式是如何的呢？我们知道在Cosmos网络可以基于IBC协议实现链链交互功能，那么是每条链与链之间都需要接入IBC协议接口吗？\n\n其实，在Cosmos网络中，区块链形成了一种中心辐射模型，位于中心的是Hub中心枢纽，Hub管理着许多被称为「Zone」的独立分支链，它可以追踪记录各个Zone的状态，而每个Zone会把自身区块的情况汇报给Hub并同步其状态。\n\nHub与Zone直接通信，而Zone与Zone之间通过IBC间接通信。当Zone与Hub建立IBC连接时，它就可以自动访问其他连接到该Hub上的Zone。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211105/e3ffdbd4d1e74a24ac90f8ae73852616\\_GY2DAKRVHA4Q.png)\n\n中心辐射模型图,图片来源于网络\n\n你可以把Hub理解为一个「港口」，而Zone是各航线上行使的「船只」，IBC是进入Hub港口共享信息的「门票」。一只船通过门票进入到这个港口中，就可以享受到其他船只上的各种信息，无需让每条船之间单独联系。\n\n在Cosmos网络中，其中心枢纽Hub直接取名为「Cosmos Hub」，充当其网络分支区块链的中央连接点，其它独立区块链Zone以分支的形式连接到Cosmos Hub上。\n\nATOM就是Cosmos Hub的原生Token，质押ATOM可以做网络的验证节点，该Token也是链上投票治理的重要工具。ATOM当前市值为109亿美元，在整个加密资产市场中排名22位。\n\nCosmos无疑为DApp的开发搭建了一个非常友好的开发环境——开发者无需浪费过多时间和精力，就可以针对应用的底层需求去创建一条专属的区块链。\n\n而对于用户来说，操作流程繁琐带来了体验的不友好，因为在该生态中，每个DApp都有一条独立的区块链，用户使用不同的应用时，不但得切换链，充提加密资产以及在各个应用中转移加密资产，都得通过IBC这道流程。\n\n对于开发者来说，环境是友好了，开发是便捷了，但应用程序之间的链接却变得疏远了。此外，相比维护一个DApp的运营，维护一条链运转成本相对较高，需要人力技术和财务力量的不断投入，这就给开发者带来了成本上的压力。\n\n要知道，当前DeFi需要「乐高组合」来形成DApp及资产间的流通，以及加密收益的扩大化，Cosmos对当前的市场需求没有形成足够的吸引力，这大概也是其整体TVL没有在这波DeFi风暴中增长的原因。而一个可喜的趋势是，Cosmos正在以应用的方式解决生态内链与链之间的壁垒问题。\n\nCosmos的生态应用\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211102/587241116c524b6b83e47293c102b44c_GY2DAKRUGA.png)\n\n*   去中心化交易所Gravity DEX\n\n简介\n\nGravity DEX是Cosmos Hub主网上的首个原生去中心化交易应用，由Cosmos开发公司Tendermint及其收购的Cosmos信息提供商和节点验证人B-Harvest共同创建。\n\n该DEX基于跨链通信协议IBC创建，支持Cosmos原生Token及其链接的多链资产Token的发行、兑换、交易、组建流动性资产池，这些操作都无需跨桥。比如，Terra就是Cosmos Hub链接的一个Zone，发行了自己的生态Token LUNA。Gravity DEX就支持ATOM和Terra链上的LUNA 、UST、ANC等资产间的兑换，也支持用户在该DEX上组成ATOM-UST等流动性池LP。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211105/bf36ce229043483ca609afe375971d70\\_GY2DAKRSGQZQ.png)\n\nGravity DEX官网\n\n运营机制\n\n相较于传统的DEX，Gravity DEX在技术上做了改进，允许用户在交易时根据自己的价格进行交易，并能确保看到的价格就是交易所能得到的价格。\n\n以Uniswap为例，该DEX的交易订单按顺序执行，以太坊矿工可以根据交易方给付的矿工费高低来选择先打包哪些交易，当然，正常的矿工都会优先处理给付矿工费高的交易，但这就导致了大额交易会被技术流的「科学家」们抢跑或挤夹，最终给普通用户带来极高的滑点损失，也给订单带来了夸张的价差。\n\n而Gravity DEX使用了批量执行交易来抵御抢先交易或价格操纵的可能。批量执行交易订单，意味着同一区块中的订单会同时处理，从根本上消除了抢跑的机会。\n\n根据Gravity DEX官网数据显示，测试阶段发生的交易有71万笔，使用的交易用户有2万多人，在资金池中锁仓的资金额（TVL）达1.9亿美元。\n\n*   一站式DeFi应用入口Emeris\n\n简介\n\nEmeris是Cosmos开发公司Tendermint推出的Cosmos生态一站式DeFi应用入口，目前该应用集合了DEX及Cosmos生态内的原生资产管理功能。未来还将成为用户进入Cosmos生态应用的一站式资产管理平台，以方便用户在Emeris上集中管理多条链上的资产。\n\nEmeris集合了GravityDEX的功能，用户可以在Emeris上直接完成Cosmos生态内多链资产的兑换及交易，无需再跳转至Gravity DEX页面。\n\nEmeris还提供了资产仪表盘，可以实时显示Cosmos生态的资产价格，用户钱包中的所有资产及分布情况也实现了可视化，用户可以根据资产收益率随时调整自己的持仓策略，管理自己的多链资产。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211105/8ec6e14e69d54470bb32dc0eb4ed5295\\_GU2TIKRSGUZQ.png)\n\nEmeris官网\n\n目前，Emeris测试版已经上线，用户可以通过多链钱包Keplr进入此应用。用户体验此应用时，钱包中需要一定数量的ATOM。Emeris应用还支持用户用信用卡购买ATOM。需要注意的是，Emeris尚未发行任何通证。\n\n*   链接以太坊的桥梁Cosmos Gravity Bridge\n\n简介\n\nCosmosGravity Bridge是专为Cosmos Hub设计的以太坊至Cosmos的资产跨链桥，该桥就链接了IBC，允许基于Cosmos搭建的多链网络通过该桥桥接以太坊的ERC-20标准资产。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211105/5579e7536fe94538a277122eaebd5acc_GY2DAKRSG42Q.png)\n\nCosmosGravity Bridge官网\n\nGravity Bridg由Althea团队创建，主要目的是解决Cosmos网络与以太坊Layer 1公链之间的资产互通及转移问题。\n\n与常见的跨链桥不同，Gravity Bridge以一个独立的区块链在运转，将为Cosmos Hub和整个Cosmos生态系统提供资产的流动性。\n\nGravity Bridge还是一个双向跨链桥，不但可以将ERC-20资产（如WETH、DAI、USDC、WBTC等）从以太坊带入到Cosmos生态中，也能将Cosmos生态内的资产带入到以太坊网络上。未来，Gravity Bridge还会将其他兼容以太坊的链上资产注入到Cosmos生态中。\n\n这也就意味着，Cosmos生态内将与其他区块链打通，资产将可以在更广阔、多样的应用中流通。需要注意的是，目前Gravity Bridge桥也未发行任何通证，其主网发布时间为11月8日。\n\n*   自动化做市商(AMM)Osmosis\n\n简介\n\nOsmosis是拥有高级自动化做市商（AMM）的去中心化交易应用，它用Cosmos SDK构建了一条独立区块链，允许开发人员根据自己的需求设计、构建和部署他们自己定制的AMM策略。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211105/a2f879b1d10e4d5d8dfdd65e64b936f3\\_GU2TIKRSG44A.png)\n\nOsmosis官网\n\n在Osmosis中，AMM的底层结构可以更改，开发者能根据资产的交易需求随时调整及更改兑换资产的权重参数等。简单理解就是，Osmosis为开发者搭建了一个AMM去中心化交易的应用模板，开发者只需根据自己的需求填充内容即可，无需再费时费力搭建一个专属的AMM应用。\n\nOsmosis内置了IBC，这就让它可以连接Cosmos生态系统内的原生资产，后期借助跨链桥Gravity Bridge，还可以整合基于以太坊的 ERC-20资产。\n\n目前，Osmosis支持Cosmos生态系统内的多链资产兑换及交易，用户可以通过多链钱包Keplr进入此应用，为ATOM-OSMO及Cosmos生态内的资产提供流动性，以获取OSMO奖励。OSMO为Osmosis的原生通证，发行总量为10亿个，目前暂报为5.6美元。\n\n（**声明：请读者严格遵守所在地法律法规，本文不代表任何投资建议**）\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211102/c80e3b09cb804624b43d5274508247a5\\_GY2DAKRWGA.png)\n\n你认为Cosmos能形成「区块链互联网」吗？\n",

{"id": "y-U3e-mP-AEOJebRFLVySdJDunWCGTZgNMQFXzkVQ_8", "title": "You can easily understanding the essence of Metaverse if you understand these three points.\n——Discusses the problems that Metaverse should solve\n", "body": "It can be said that the definition of ‘Metaverse’ has been discussed many times by thousands of medias recently. Of course, many people still confused what Metaverse it is after reading dozens of articles. - this is understandable, at present, the development of theories is still lagging behind the practices. There is no final conclusion, and there are different opinions.\n\nTherefore, my point of view is just jump off from definitions and discuss from another angle: What problems should the Metaverse solve? Or what role should it play? Understanding this prospect clearly, we can naturally measure whether \"Meta\" or even other \"Metaverse\" projects are \"true ones\" or just put a dress of “Metaverse”.\n\n1. The Metaverse should expand the boundary and dimension of the Internet development through the ownership on chain confirmation;\n\nThe earliest function of the Internet was to connect people all over the world. At first, it was web pages, forums and e-mail. With the progress of technology, it has now reached the level of using voice and video as the mainstream interactive mode. Today, we can complete all interaction just using a smart phone. With the development of smart appliances and furniture the concept of \"connect everything\" has come up - but these applications still can not fulfill the demand of internet development until the concept of \"Metaverse\".\n\nFirst of all, I need to clarify my point of view. It is not necessary to use VR or AR technology to be a metaverse project. The qualified project can be an interactive web page with only a few pixels cartons, or even an NFT with only a few lines like ‘loot’. The most important contribution of Metaverse that to expand and upgrade the Internet world is to put crypto assets on chain and it is through decentralization These crypto assets can be your avatar, NFT art works , virtual land (such as the lands in sandbox, decentralands and cryptovoxels), articles you published on Mirror, game equipment and characters.\n\nWhy is it important to confirm the ownership of digital assets? It is because only by confirming the ownership on chain that can assure asset owner’s true controlling these crypto assets. Your game equipment can not be deleted, your articles and crypto lands can not be blocked by the behavior of the centralized platform. Even if the project who made your NFT avatar goes bankrupt or disappears, your avatar is still lying in your wallet, you can trade on NFT exchanges such as opensea at any time; even if opensea goes bankrupt, there are dozens of other trading platforms such as Rarible for standby——Ownership confirmation essentially solves the problem of the owners sense of security, and the sense of security opens up the boundary from ‘virtual ownership’ to ‘true ownership’.\n\nAt the same time, through the ownership confirmation on chain, the usability of digital assets can also be interconnected through technical means in the future. You can imagine that when you face Ganon in Zelda with Ashbringer Chosen from World of Warcraft in hands, or you made your sandbox character wearing the gloves from the Tifa facing the Velkhana in Monster Hunter (of course, the numerical model requires the balance and between the game manufacturer and the player community), it has indeed entered an \"infinite universe\" without boundary and dimensional restrictions. In this space, all your efforts and gains are practical and can be proved, used and even inherited.\n\nFrom this perspective, to judge whether Facebook is on the real path of \"Metaverse\", we can analyze whether the subsequent social product reform can really help users achieve the purpose of confirming the rights of digital assets (such as created pictures, articles, etc.), and even whether it can realize the independence and decentralization of user account control(at present, Facebook can still easily block and delete accounts). I personally understand that such changes require centralized companies to transfer many governance rights to community, which is not easy, and it is actually quite conflict from the centralized governance structure and concept of ‘company”.\n\nOn 2nd November, ENS, the famous domain name registration platform of Web3, announced that it would change the platform governance mode in the form of Dao, which is a very good attempt. We will wait and see how it will work in the future.\n\n1. Metauniverse needs to provide an outlet for human status anxiety in the Internet age;\n\nThe development of the Internet has made people extremely dependent on the Internet. Online social networking, entertainment and consumption have accounted for most or even most of the time for people living in cities. In people’s real work and life, people can easily  locate their position in society through their careers, social relations and even interests, and it has formed a set of rules.\n\nHowever, in the increasingly high proportion of Internet life, how can you quickly cut into an interest community and find your position in it? Most traditional Internet social platforms do not have a particularly fast way: Forums - you need to earn levels and points; twitter you need to operate daily contents to attract new followers ; and some web site, you need to do test to  prove your knowledge before you are qualified to register.\n\nNFT, an important interface product in the Metaverse, provides a core solution: the deep combination of personal avatars with digital arts. For example, you are using cryptopunks avatar (of course, it must be genuine. It is said that Twitter and Facebook will launch verification channels in the future)The corresponding community naturally knows that you are either an original blockchain leader or a cross-border big guy who directly buy it (such as Jordan Belfort, the prototype of the Wall Street wolf who recently entered the pit).\n\nDifferent avatars define yourself and directly give you the passport to integrate the community. Of course, you can have the many passport  for different communities at the same time, depending on your own needs and whether the corresponding community concept behind the NFT is consistent with you. - this  actually proves Status Anxiety  theory by Alain de Botton’s published in 2004. The theory is coincide: modern people solve their status anxiety through philosophy, art, politics, religion and other ways. NFT highly integrates these factors in a sense and provides clear paths and clues for self-expression, and then cooperates with the diversified Web 3.0 community system, to provide a solution to human Status Anxiety in the real Internet era(this is also an important reason why Discord plays extremely powerful roles and becomes the core communication platform of all Web 3.0 projects).\n\n1. Metaverse makes individuals have diversity incomes, and even creates independent occupations gradually.\n\nThe establishment of the economic model is the fundamental reason why the Metaverse is tenable. Taking the popular game Axie infinity as an example, it is the junk games in the eyes of traditional game developers but generated more than twice revenue of \" Arena Of Valor \" since July. This figure seems not very surprising but let us dig a little deeper and make a comparison. Axie has only about 1.5 million daily users (up to 2 million in October 2021), but \" Arena Of Valor \"it has more than 100 million daily users, and even 400 million users are online at the peak time! This is not because of game playability, but the because of  the economic system. Axie sets every player has his position to make money: there are farmers who play daily tasks, there are breeders who open eggs by breeding pets, there are also competitive players who earn high PVP bonuses through ranking. The production -combustion economic model of game relatively curbs excessive inflation, allowing the game to continue to retain old players and introduce new players (of course, it is not very fun for me).\n\nThe economic system of traditional games lacks the \"ownership confirmation on the chain\" in the first part, and has not designed a particularly effective economic model, resulting in that most players are \"consumers\" rather than \"producers\". This also reminds me of Blizzard in their golden age. In Diablo 3 they designed the cash Auction house - the idea was very advanced, and brilliant and it has really made many players taste \"producer\" for a period of time (I still have some Mexican dollars from sales of equipment in my current Blizzard Account), but it does lack technical means and ideas to finalize a circular economic model.\n\nOf course, not all the applications designed for the economic system are Metaverse applications. Taking games for example, the combination of economic system, playability and flexibility is the core elements that can attract users for a long time - this is why I have high expectations for Sandbox, which has not been launched yet. At present, according to the official introduction of the game, the future Metaverse careers includes landlord, digital designers, metaverse architects, game designers and even metaverse tour guides and others that did not exist before.\n\nThe economic foundation determines the superstructure. The reason why the meta universe is a meta universe is that people can live in, obtain income, grow continuously, and expand their boundaries and upper limits. Whenever you feel like you can live on it, that is the Metaverse time - and I believe this day won’t be long.", "timestamp": 1636214868, "digest": "zY8j1KUKpEnB_zlvhrUSUZOeSdEvSi2_UtYBIrPfZO4", "contributor": "0xB6C2bBEbc94a910e0fd37267DAB56fb2130dbb97"}

For example a 100 dollar bill is fungible it can be replaced by any other 100 dollar bill and the value will remain the same and no one will notice either. Similarly a   bitcoin is fungible as is ETH.\n\nIn NFTs one card is totally different from another card. Bored Ape yacht club  mania tells there are 10k bore app’s variations and all are different. No card is similar to another as all cards are unique and ownership is stored in the blockchain. We can easily prove the ownership of a particular NFT.\n\nNFTs are generally part of the Ethereum blockchain . NFT store more information than a ETH coin. Now  Other blockchains are also supporting NFTs .some of the prominent ones are Solana ,Matic and Enjoin  among others minting their  own NFT.\n\nNFT can be anything music, blog, drawing, art of course   but the flavour of the season is digital art using Technology.\n\nThe digital art is  a digital file .You can copy a digital file basically that is what a digital art is but it does not give you ownership rights. NFTs give you the ownership rights to that digital art\n\nIt is becoming like art collection or something like that. There is implied belief and hope of increasing value in these pieces .  Some  NFTs were auctioned at mainstream auction houses also .video clips,  and  songs   converted to NFT.\n\nThe NFT market is evolving like a real market and communities developed around it.  Penguin communities, bored ape yacht community.\n\n![](https://i1.wp.com/finostock.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unnamed-file-60.jpeg?resize=750%2C422&ssl=1)\n\n**BENEFITS**\n\nThe NFT is beneficial to the community as a whole . It benefits the artist as he can directly sell his creation without going through agent or paying commission. The buyer can buy by evaluation and feed  back from communities. The collector can similarly benefit by easily accessing the market instead of going through the auction houses\n\nNFT is a unique token on the blockchain it can be like a picasso as its only one and it can be like trading card also where there are 100s of numbered copies.\n\n**USE CASE**\n\nThe future uses if NFT is what is driving the technology forward. It can be used as ID card to get access to networks, to real world uses like banking maybe voting too in future\n\nNFT can be linked to prove ownership of Real estate assets. They can be linked to the deeds and deeds can be converted onto tokenized digital assets. All these will reside in some blockchain.\n\nThe use cases of NFT can be summarized as below\n\n**Art NFTs**\n\nThe physical art pieces converted to  NFTs apart from the digital art.\n\n**Gaming NFT**\n\nThis has huge opportunities in the gaming industry which is expanding like anything. NFT can be cars , parts of car, parts of collectibles that power the game. Use cases in gaming industry is evolving every day.Only thing holding it back perhaps is long duration development journey of games .But with enough resources this too can change.\n\n**Finance**\n\nhere the NFTs can act like tokens and participate and create token pools and move forward the defi . NFTs can be used as collateral for loans even fractional trading of the NFTs can be done. Opportunities are endless.\n\n**Fashion and wearables**\n\nluxury meets technology. Real world high fashion meets digital fashion. With insertion of  augmented reality this is going to be one exciting area. As more people spend more time in digital world digital fashion will become equally important as real fashion.\n\n**Music NFT**\n\nany song can be converted into NFT. Musicians and music labels can release collectibles piece of music. The musicians can directly release their songs ,no need of any centralised market place like I tunes.\n\n**Logistics**\n\nThe [commodities ](https://finostock.com/heres-why-kinder-morgan-kmi-is-a-strong-value-stock/)being transported can be better managed with NFT containing all the details of commodities like, perishable date, time from farm everything built into it.\n\n**Domain name ownership**\n\nDomain name ownership can be sold easily and with sure shot authority about the ownership of domain.\n\n\\*\\*Identification \\*\\*\n\nNFT can be used as an id for use at online and offline purposes.\n\n**Events and ticketing**\n\nNFT will act as Tickets which can contain information like how much of the ticket value goes to artist and ho much to the support staff .what is the concert number.

While other sources of capital such as grants and tax credits are out there, the two predominant sources are **debt** and **equity**. \n\nIn commercial real estate, available debt is determined by several factors.  The main concern is solvency.  Naturally, a lender wants to know they have an extremely high likelihood of receiving interest and principal payback of their loan.  In evaluating this risk, a lender looks at the likely cash flow (net income) of a property and the value (what it could sell for) of the property.  Property cash flow informs the lender the of likelihood of being paid interest for providing the loan and in most cases the ability to paydown principal incrementally.  Property value enables lenders to determine that if the owner defaults on the loan and hands the collateral (i.e. the property) over to the lender, the lender can reasonably sell the property at least for the amount of their loan, and be made whole.  On top of these two property-level reviews, lenders look at the property owner.  Does the property owner have a history of success?  Does the property owner have a high net worth and liquidity (aka cash) to withstand some tough times?  In the case of a recourse loan (most bank loans), if the property is foreclosed on by the lender, and the property doesn’t sell for more than the loan amount, does the borrower have additional cash or assets the lender can go after?  Needless to say, debt, for a property owner, can be a terrifying thing.  It often makes up 60-80% of the total capital in a project and drives property owners to make decisions in the interest of paying interest.        \n\nWhile debt may fund 60-80% of the capital needed for a real estate project, the balance of funds is sourced from equity.  The property owner themselves may be the sole contributor of these funds, but often, equity is raised from other investors.  The typical equity investor evaluates whether or not to invest based upon numerable characteristics of the investment (i.e. is it in popular area?, has it worked in the past?, what’s my risk of losing money?) combined with the property owner’s promise of delivering a *certain %-return over a particular period of time* (i.e. 15% over 10 years).  Like debt, decisions by the property owner are based upon the necessity to provide investors promised returns over a finite period of time or risk never receiving investment again. \n\nThese two forms of capital, debt and equity, heavily influence the property owner’s decision making.  It’s the reason development projects are “value engineered”.  In other words, perpetually revised to make as cheap as possible. It’s the reason rents need to be at a certain level (to cover **debt**) and why they are raised further (to provide promised returns to **equity**). It’s the reason lenders and equity investors repeatedly provide capital to *proven* areas vs. *unproven* areas or *copy/paste* projects vs. *original* endeavors. Most importantly it’s the reason the real estate world is perpetually pushing “growth”.  Meaning, to increase the “value” of a property so that it can be sold or refinanced (paying back debt and delivering equity returns) only for the process to start over from a new, now higher, baseline.\n\nThis is not an anti-growth argument but a call out as to why the current structure of capital (debt + equity) so heavily influences the quality of our built environment.\n\nWhat often gets lost in all this financial engineering is the reason the property is even there to begin with, which is to provide **spaces** to **people** for a period of time (whether that’s hours, days, months, or years).  Sadly, thoughtfully designed spaces are often reserved for the “ultra-luxury” realm, like a new condo development in DUMBO, a “trophy” office tower, or an institutional building (i.e. art museum).  So much of what is delivered to the balance of society reflects providing what’s *good enough* to draw in demand and generate the necessary cash flow to satisfy **debt** and **equity**.\n\nMany, especially in architecture and design have become disenchanted with this world, and a handful are starting to push back. Groups like the [Office of Jonathan Tate](https://www.officejt.com/) (New Orleans) and [Assemble Studio](https://assemblestudio.co.uk/) (London) have completed several *self-initiated* projects, creating life-giving (aka not boring) spaces for the “everyday” citizen. Unfortunately, while in the process of doing so, groups like OJT and Assemble are recognizing the power (and anxiety) that **debt** and **equity** can wield over them.\n\nWe need to take a step back from the debt + equity dogma and design a new form of capital to foster creative courage.  As [WOWOWA Architecture](https://www.wowowa.com.au/) (Melbourne) says, “Life’s too short for boring spaces.”\n\n Disclaimer:\n\nThe pursuit of re-designing capital to foster the creation of “not boring” spaces does not mean a call for more starchitecture in the world.\n\nIt’s to enable folks like [Davidson Rafailidis](https://www.davidsonrafailidis.net/) (Buffalo, NY) to create more spaces like this.\n\n![Together Apart Cat Café by Davidson Rafailidis (photographer: Florian Holzherr) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ykia0utIS-2k0JOhu0mSV.jpg?height=1000&width=1499)\n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n ", "timestamp": 1636218381, "digest": "XrekfhM71apGtU5LbG2BlSHQYhsnfKqxd5GRkiWw71w", "contributor": "0x2b326B22acE1E3f6859Fb43b43545C7Cbd67d736"}

We came together from a [tweet](https://twitter.com/scottfits/status/1410724134468739076), and today we closed on a 40 acre parcel of land in Wyoming. The inspiration for the project was the [Wyoming DAO law](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/crypto-daos-and-the-wyoming-frontier-9251606/), which created a pathway for DAOs to own assets. \n\nWe came together in a Discord [community](https://discord.com/invite/2pzV6wnWZx) and used Mirror to [offer Citizenship NFTs](https://city.mirror.xyz/TRMrm5r5CYtYwaG3G4jG125pBv6dyuiTZ2FkBqskTBo) that gave holders the ability to vote on what land to acquire and how to use it.\n\nWe incorporated a Wyoming DAO LLC, for which the Articles of Incorporation became the inspiration for our Citizenship NFTs, pictured below. \n\n![Our Citizen NFTs that showcase the articles of incorporation overlaid on the state of Wyoming  ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6nRHu4A9YV2I7GHMbO-Hc.png?height=3910&width=10316)\n\nFinally, we bought our first piece of land, 40 acres near Cody, Wyoming (a few miles from where Kanye West owned a ranch). The terrain is rocky and not especially fertile, but this parcel is 45 minutes from an airport and has a well for water on site.\n\n![Planting the CityDAO flag](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0Rjw4igUr8K2zU9Llct3F.png?height=1916&width=1442)\n\n## The path forward\n\nThis is just the beginning. The CityDAO community is still deciding how to use this land, and what property to acquire next. See what we are up to on our official [website](https://www.citydao.io/) and join our Discord.\n\nRecently, Vitalik joined our Discord and [wrote about CityDAO](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/10/31/cities.html), exploring the benefits of using mechanism design and blockchains to improve systems like land use, zoning, governance, and resource rights.\n\n### Pictures from the land\n\nI visited Wyoming to explore the parcel before we purchased it. The land has a rugged, natural beauty.\n\n![Looking out over our parcel](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/awUSQrtoEa9bzSK0MnHuf.png?height=1788&width=1476)\n\n![Using Google Earth to outline our parcel in red.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iubOKRxrIl-etiPj3OerB.png?height=886&width=1322)\n\n![A well is available at the property](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9WRkcrFSLhKs4f5nzH19w.png?height=1424&width=1450)\n\n## Get involved\n\nCityDAO is exploring all the different ways DAOs can own assets in a decentralized way. The path ahead is uncharted - we are a group of explorers seeing how we can combine web3 with real assets to democratize and decentralize access to land and real estate. Perhaps we can share our tools with other DAOs, or just continue to acquire assets together. \n\n\\- the citizens of [citydao](https://citydao.io)", "timestamp": 1636218603, "digest": "1brVmH5HPJ5gLtIEfzIiJj6od81eUCdkJYm7m10V1Aw", "contributor": "0x33eD481F752f05A292346C71E16aFbB0fE548656"}

{"id": "SV7__X--sx3cG_BBgAX7P-gmDrQKnzMneuuqv-_byb0", "title": "Delimerence", "body": "## The Pill\n\n**DeLimerence XR**\n*Take One Capsule By Mouth Daily*\n\n— read the green pill bottle that Thomas was holding. This was going to change everything for him. He tried to temper his excitement by telling himself that he still had to be deliberate about his actions once he took what was inside the plastic cylinder he held. “This is not a magic bean,” he kept repeating to himself.  His first few failed attempts to pry open the bottle dampened the peak of his narrative arc a bit. After soldiering on and cursing himself, he finally held the red translucent capsule in his hand. He stared at it for a few seconds\n\n“Was this still a good idea?”\n\n“Would I get addicted to it and be unable to fall in love later in life when I want to?”\n\n“Would it somehow affect my ability to play tennis?”\n\nHe remembered something vague that he had read about how the drug affects heart rate.\n\nThe answers to his questions were on the medical information sheet that lay on the table. He did not bother to check it. He knew all that he needed to know about DeLimerence before he went to the psychiatrist.\n\nDeLimerence would stop him from feeling frantic, anxious, and out of control whenever he really liked a girl. This had held him back his whole adult life. He would like someone he met on a dating app or at a party, or for a brief moment at a coffee shop.\n\n“It could practically happen anywhere anytime,” he remembered telling the psychiatrist.\n\n“I would really unreasonably like this person and then completely lose my mind over them,” Thomas had explained when the psychiatrist had asked, “why are you here?”\n\n“I would then be unable to concentrate on my game during the matches, text her too much, become a real nervous wreck with extreme mood swings. It affected everything I did, and nothing good came out of it,” Thomas explained as he looked out the window of the psychiatrist’s office, envious of the trees that swayed gently in the wind, seemingly enjoying a better life than him.\n\nIn the middle of his explainer, Thomas noticed that he was having a hard time even making eye contact with the psychiatrist. He tried to turn his head towards the person in front of him, but his eyes landed squarely at the bottom of a bookshelf, fixating on a kitschy photo frame that read, “You are loved and important.”\n\nHe knew that the psychiatrist was just a pawn to make quick work of in the medical-industrial complex. He was going to ask him all the questions off DSM-IV, check off boxes, give him the pill.\n\n“Did you hear about any drugs for this elsewhere? Did someone recommend this to you?” the psychiatrist had asked as Thomas finished his sentence.\n\n“No,” he responded without a moment’s delay.\n\nOn the back of his mind was the subreddit r/unalovebomber that had put him onto the diagnosis he was seeking. It had been yet another torrid week. Thomas had gone on a single date with someone he met on Hinge. He had kept his cool before the date even though the long texts had built anticipation. He kept repeating his usual mantras in the shower just before the date “keep it cool, enjoy yourself, even if nothing happens, you get to enjoy someone’s company.” And then the date had gone extraordinarily well. They were both athletes - Thomas, a tennis player, ranked #400 in the world, Maddie a triathlete who worked as a nurse. They spent 6 hours talking about life, books, music, childhood stories. A day passed, Thomas held onto his nerve and did not double text, and then he got the text\n\n> You’re a great guy but I don’t think it’s a match. Hope you have a great career and make it to the top 250\n\nHe knew the drill. He had done this before and felt helpless about the fact that his baseline instincts were going to take over. Resent her, console himself by saying, “it’s her fucking loss”, watch porn and then after 4 hours when all coping mechanisms failed, weep and scream into the couch in his living room. The downstairs neighbors had filed a noise complaint the first time he cried when he moved into his new apartment, and the couch was a good acoustic cushion. After about 6 hours of this he had found new (or perhaps old) resolve to fix this once and for all and was on r/unalovebomber subreddit looking for inspiration, solutions or whatever hooked his mind. He found a post by r/epicureanjoel that he knew was going to change things and there was some sense of finality to it :\n\n> * I’ve been on DeLimerence XR for 100 days and it has completely transformed my life\\*\n> * I’ve been a 7/10 all my life, rarely had problems finding dates regularly but only met people I liked once in a while. And then when I met someone I liked, I would become a complete schizoid and show classic symptoms of a love bomber - sending too many messages, not taking any kind of negative reaction from her well, my mind would be completely out of place. Even got to the point where I almost lost a job because of this habit. Finally got diagnosed for affection processing disorder and got prescribed DeLimerance XR 10mg. I’ve been on 4 dates since starting medication, and it has gone great. I have a good time with them, don’t get anxious about text replies and you know what? 3 of those 4 dates have gone well, I’m still seeing them. Something about me being more cool and aloof about it definitely makes me more attractive to them and to myself. Don’t fall for the temporary displacement of ego that instant attraction or “love at first sight” offers. Get diagnosed and work on yourself.\\*\n\nIt all came down to this moment now. Thomas had read that it takes anywhere between 30 minutes to one hour for DeLimerence XR to take effect. The most common dosage instruction on r/unalovebomber was to take it when you were actively dating. It was Friday, and Thomas had a few matches on his dating app that he had not initiated conversations with. He was also planning to go to a house concert with a friend, Vijayan, in the evening. ‘Friend’ was too generous a definition for their relationship. Men who are in their 30s don’t have friends. Their lives are like airports, people come and go, stay awhile, make conversation, but eventually, they leave like they originally intended to.\n\nThomas felt an easiness about texting the girls on the app. Not excited, not nervous and on edge. Not craving approval like he always used to. He even flirted when they replied back. He had a picture of him wearing a t-shirt based on the PT Anderson movie There Will Be Blood, and someone he matched with commented.\n\n“Nice t-shirt btw. I love that movie.”\n\nAnd Thomas, to his own surprise, had replied “Haha who knows may be you’ll get to wear it someday”.\n\n2 hours in, he tried to cast doubt over the effect of the medicine, maybe he had just convinced himself that the pill works, and nothing substantial had actually changed in his brain chemistry. But he also did not want to find out. He liked the way it felt and planned to continue to do so. He tried to remember the names of the girls on the dating app he had ended up making plans with and could not remember. “Doesn’t matter. I have plans with them and it’s just a first date anyway,” he told himself. It was time to find out whether this drug helped with social anxiety when talking with women.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Club\n\nThomas was meeting Vijayan at the club where the House concert was happening. Vijayan was a gay Indian American that his first generation immigrant parents were proud of. He had gone through  all the layers of professional success that Asian immigrant parents could think of - graduating from Carnegie Mellon, a Harvard MBA with consulting experience in the big three, stock in a Silicon Valley company that went public a year ago. He had defeated all of his parents’ expectations. So complete was his victory that when Vijayan went home to visit them, they let him sleep in the master bedroom while they slept in the guest room. But despite all this, he struggled with relationships, often ending up in ones were he was physically abused. Thomas understood that they hung out despite being part of different social classes because of this love sickness that they shared. It came with perks such as free tickets to a Tiesto concert or regular refills of Ketamine, the good kind.\n\nAs the Uber pulled up to the club, Thomas reminded himself not to talk about taking DeLimerence. He kept telling himself that this was an intimate detail that no one needed to know about him. Yet, on some level he was also ashamed that he needed a drug to feel the way normal humans probably felt and operated.\n\n“Thomas, you look different today. Did you shave?” Vijayan asked as he caught Thomas just as he was scanning his ticket.\n\nThomas chuckled nervously. Had he been found out already, “Hey man, I guess so? Your shirt looks great btw”. A compliment was always an excellent way to deflect attention from oneself.\n\nAs they walked into the club, Thomas thought about how he would not choose this experience if he was single. It was too loud, there too many people, and everyone was trying hard to signal how hot they were and how they were different from their peers by 15% but not more. He was certain this was a feeling shared by others in the club as well, just that it was masked by whatever drug they were on or the affection they felt from the person standing next to them, sometimes a friend, sometimes a partner. He scanned around to see who he could talk to while Vijayan hovered around making conversation. He could sense that Vijayan was becoming more inebriated with each sentence that rolled out of his tongue, and within an hour or so he would just be an animated object that sometimes spoke gibberish for Thomas’s amusement.\n\nThere was a tall blonde girl wearing a short white dress drinking at the bar, away from everyone else. He considered her for a moment and his brain made the calculation within 5 seconds that she was perhaps too ambitious a target for understanding the effects of DeLimerence.\n\nHe instead squared in on the girl wearing a black crop and black high waist jeans, with long curly black hair. She was in a corner, holding a beer, she looked like an amused rabbit to Thomas. As he sipped his drink while standing next to her, Thomas examined his emotional state for a moment. His heart was quiet, he didn’t feel like his mind was racing, there were no indicators of fear. He felt euphoric and on a mission. He turned to her a couple of times, waiting for a moment where they made eye contact, and when it happened on the third try, he said “nice necklace, quite classic.”\n\n“Aw thanks. Well, funny story, I found it in an abandoned car near my house,” she replied, smiling. He could feel that her brain was quickly registering him and his body language.\n\nPerfect. Thomas thought to himself. She had responded with something to latch onto, and the conversation could now go places. As their conversation continued, Thomas would drift away in his head for moments in between to examine how he felt about    Remy, the woman he was talking to. He thought he was holding her at a distance and like he knew where the conversation was going to go next and where to take it. This was a new and interesting sensation for Thomas, who usually found himself blank when he was smitten by someone - it was not that he did not have anything to ask or say. In fact, it was that his mind was traveling at 100 mph, trying to narrow down on a single thing from the myriad of thoughts that flew by.\n\n“So is this what you do on Fridays? Smooth talk women in dim-lit clubs?” Remy asked.\n\nThomas smirked, put his hand to his chest and replied, “Aww I’m heartbroken that you think that of me while here I am thinking I don’t run into interesting people like you”, and ran his palm on the inside of her elbow. What he said would have been true a week before, but not today. Today it felt like a lie, and he felt okay with it. This what be must courtship means to people now, he thought as he felt Remy standing closer to him.\n\nThere comes a moment in time while at a club where the effect of drugs and the music crescendo and everyone feels like they share a fleeting communal moment. After that peak, things tend to go downhill. As this moment approached, Thomas was further sure that he was going home with Remy tonight. He looked around for Vijayan and saw him standing against the bar, drink in his hand, his eyes looking like they were searching for something, perhaps trying to find the last ounce of energy in him to co-ordinate the movement of his body. Thomas, for the first time since they started hanging out, felt terrible for Vijayan. He even detested him a bit. “I guess hanging out with people like this is why I never had any luck with women,” he thought to himself.\n\n“Bunch of fucking beta cucks,” he thought as he planted his lips on Remy’s while gripping her close.\n\nWhen they had sex at Remy’s place, Thomas did not feel like he was falling in love or incredibly attracted to her. The sex was fine. Thomas never took deep pleasure from it except for the one time he was in a two-year relationship. It felt mechanical, but he felt powerful if it elicited reactions from the woman he was with, so that is what he focussed on. He was glad that he did not feel like staying for long after like he usually did, lingering on in the aftermath, hoping there is something deeper there. He felt cured.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Court\n\nThomas was playing the best tennis of his life.\n\nHe was in the quarterfinal of an ATP 500 tournament for the first time in his life.\n\nEvery time he got knocked out of the tournament, his coach said, “You need to be ruthless. You need a bit more of that fuck you attitude that the best players have”. He felt that in his approach on court in this tournament, he would not let it up now. He had won the last game 6-0, 6-1 and let out a guttural war cry at the end of the game. The crowd booed, but Thomas felt invigorated by being the hated one for once, not the nice guy. “Like the best in the business”, he thought to himself.\n\nToday he was up against world number 105 Felix Oviedo. As he warmed up for the game, he thought about the last three weeks since he started DeLimerence XR. He had been with three women, all three of whom he left on read. He liked to think the control he felt reflected elsewhere, including his game. He was not wrong. DeLimerence had made him more ruthless, calculated in unexplainable ways. “You never know how its going to affect you until you take. Different people have different results” read a user’s post on r/UnaLovebomber\n\nAs he warmed up for the game, he saw Felix walk into the court. He was accompanied by his coach and a woman who looked like his girlfriend. She was above average height for a woman, wearing a flowing dark blue dress that stopped above her knee, a white hat, and round green sunglasses. She stood by Felix as he talked with his coach, running her palm over his shoulders, brushing something off his face. They exchanged glances often, sometimes pecking each other on the lips. Thomas was distracted and annoyed by this. He felt something inside him sink, a feeling that he had not experienced since he started DeLimerence. He took a few deep breaths and tried to remember if he had taken DeLimerence today. He clearly remembered the green bottle in his hand about an hour ago. He felt this moment would pass, so he resumed his training, trying to focus on finding the middle of the racket with every hit. Fourth shot of a new rally with his went flying into the stands. Mishits happen. He reset himself with a few more bounces of the ball and glances at his watch. The next three returns sprayed across the court - two of them going too far and one hitting the net.\n\n“Calm down Thoma” his French coach urged from the other side.\n\nAs he walked out the court, yielding the rest of the time to Felix for his warm-up, he glanced at the couple who were sharing an embrace, and Thomas felt defeated.\n\nHe sat in the dressing room 20 minutes before the game, wondering what had hit him. His mind was racing again and seemed like it was searching for reasons to explain this. When he remembered that he had no one with him except for the coach he was paying to be there, he felt a sense of inevitability. The return of the same memories, like a fly stuck to honey. Thomas was not going to give up now. This was his moment, and he had to make it last. His body had been under stress throughout the tournament, and it needed more replenishment than it usually did. Perhaps it applied to DeLimerence too. The current dosage did not have the desired effect.  There was no great conflict in coming to this decision, so he took another 10mg pill of DeLimerence XR 10 minutes before he went on court.\n\nThe game with Felix was harder than his last.  The first set went to Felix. The second went to the tie break. Thomas was on set point. He reset his mind by remembering Tchivosky overture 1812. The music peaked in Thomas’s head as he brought the ball to the racket and raised his hands to serve for the set. He heard a “Cmon Felix” from behind him when he released the ball but Thomas felt an easiness come over his body, and his racket swung down on the ball, and he knew he had hit an ace the moment the ball hit the sweet spot. Felix did not move. Thomas did not feel the need to. Instead, he turned around to where the words of encouragement had come from. It was the girlfriend. He pumped his fist and then drummed it against his chest while looking directly at her. The match was won in that moment. The next set finished 6-2 in Thomas’s favor. He had made it to the semifinal of an ATP 500 tournament.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Hotel\n\nIt had been 6 hours since he took the second 10mg pill. He was going to feel the effect of the drug well into the night. Thomas was about to head out to get dinner. He expanded his chest as he looked at himself in the mirror. He stared into his reflection and could not recognize the fierceness in the eyes of the person that stared back at him. He usually rested after games, nursing wounds, doing plyometric exercises to get in shape for the next game, which was tomorrow. But today, he wanted to go out. He needed to be with a woman and wanted the world to know he could have anyone he wants at this moment.\n\nGoing alone to dinner was something he rarely did, and never at a restaurant with $$$ on Google maps. As the waitress guided him to a table, he noticed no one at the bar counter seats except for a woman wearing a white summer dress with a low back cut. He asked the waitress if he could be seated at the bar instead and moved in that direction before the waitress could respond. He glanced in the direction of the woman as he sat two seats away from her and smiled at her when she looked to see who had decided to dare to disturb her solitude.\n\nThe bar tables overlooked the ocean through floor-to-ceiling glass windows. The restaurant was on the 3rd floor, and at Thomas’s eye line, it seemed as if the restaurant was floating on the ocean. The last tinge of yellow of the sun refracted through the bottles of alcohol lined up a 30-foot shelf.\n\nThe waitress had taken his order, and the bartender had turned away after taking an order for an old fashioned from the woman in white. Thomas saw the opportunity for an opening.\n\n“So you’re a fellow whiskey lover?” He asked.\n\nShe turned to Thomas, smiled assuredly and replied, “Is that the best opening line that you’ve got?”.\n\nThomas was not fluttered the least by it. He had got good or at least felt good about dealing with volleys such as this one.\n\n“Would you rather talk about how beautiful the weather is, or should I remark on the beauty of the ocean?” He replied without taking his eye off hers.\n\nShe looked away before he did, into the glass in front of her “sorry, I didn’t mean to be rude, I’m Sarah, and yes, I do love a good whiskey,” she said as she raised the glass towards him.\n\n“I’m Thomas. I love a good whiskey too, especially today,” Thomas replied, leaving it open for a question.\n\n“What happened today?”\n\n“Just won a game of tennis,” Thomas said, with understatement in his voice.\n\n“Are you a tennis player?”\n\n“Yes,” replied Thomas as he noticed that Sarah had shifted her body towards him and was looking at his face intently, searching for something. Thomas mistook this for interest so he continued, “Playing someone ranked 51st in the world tomorrow actually.”\n\nSarah interrupted the conversation.\n\n“Sorry. Are you on DeLimerence?” She asked.\n\nThomas gulped and flashbacked to the experience he had had before he starting taking Delimerence - one of his mind traveling at an enormous speed trying to find a response that would make him feel less judged. But nothing bubbled up to the top of his mind to fill the void in the nick of time.\n\n“How did you know” he finally replied, almost defeated but not showing it on his face.\n\n“You have that look in your eyes,” Sarah replied, feeling slightly guilty that she had brought it up.\n\nThomas was staring at his drink and then into the ocean.\n\n“It’s alright, I’m on it too,” she replied, hoping it would soften the blow.\n\nThis piqued his head. “You’re on DeLimerence? Have you been with someone on DeLimerence before?” Thomas asked.\n\n“No, why would I want to be with someone who’s just like me?” She replied and then chuckled as she ended that sentence.\n\nThomas wondered why the effect of DeLimerence was not working at this moment. Was it a placebo all this while? He felt like he needed to impress this woman so that she would go home with him and at the same time resented her.\n\n“What is this look in my eyes that you noticed?” Thomas asked as he composed himself and looked Sarah in the eyes. The sounds of the bar, the conversations, clinking glasses came into sharp focus as he asked this.\n\n“The look of deep amusement with yourself and how you are.”\n\n“Like you’d fall in love with your reflection any moment now.”\n\nThomas crumbled. He wanted to yell at her, maybe even hit her. He looks at his palms that were face down on the table. They were trembling, with anxiety or anger. Thomas was not sure.\n\nHe continued eating and finishing his drink while he and Sarah both sat in the quietness of the bar counter. When it turned dark, the ocean was not visible anymore. It seemed that nothing existed outside of the window. Just an unassuming void.\n\nSarah got up to leave first and glanced at Thomas, who never lifted his head up. She walked out. Thomas could hear the sound of her heels moving further away. He felt relieved for a moment. And then he started ruminating on the game tomorrow.\n\n“What if DeLimerence does not work anymore? It does not seem to have any effect in this moment,” he thought to himself.\n\nHe felt a cold wave build up in his head like his nerves were tingling against his skull, and this sensation washed across his spine, and he felt his eyes well up, like he had no control over it. Finally, he brought himself back to the moment and collected himself enough to pay the check.\n\nA cool evening breeze hit his face as he walked out of the restaurant. For a couple of seconds, after he forgot where he had been and what had just transpired, a sense of peace crept in, only to be violently jolted out of it by an intrusive thought, “Wish I could share this with someone.” His mind and body were pulling him in opposite directions, one racing ahead and the other crashing down. Thomas held his nerve till he got to his hotel room, and then as soon as the door was closed behind him, he collapsed on the ground face first. He felt his chest heaving and a scream building up in his throat, and he let it out. He felt tears rushing down his cheeks.\n\nAt this moment, his inner voice reverted to what it had been taught as a child. “Why don’t you go fucking kill yourself” it demanded, and Thomas wailed harder to drown out the voice. Until his body was tired and could not generate any more thoughts.\n\nThere is a sense of clarity that fills the space that fills the space of sadness once it has left the body. The first lucid thought told Thomas that he would probably kill himself if he goes through a similar evening again. He had read about DeLimerence crashes on r/UnaLoveBomber.\n\nThomas had given up. DeLimerence was not going to save him. The game with world number 51 was lost before it had begun.\n\n## Let it go\n\nThomas looked around and saw people trickle into the stadium. This would be the biggest crowd he had played in front of, and it did not mean anything to him. He could feel the texture of the handle of the racket in his hand, his breath against his nostrils, foot firm yet nimble and ready to move. As he hit back ball after ball that his coach served him, he felt he had more time than ever before. Every ball seemed to be hitting the racket’s sweet spot, yet it was not bringing him the dopamine hits it usually did.  It just was.\n\nWhen the match began, the crowd was on the side of tournament favorite and world number 51 Grigor Milov. Thomas could hear chants of “Grigor, Grigor” as he lined up to serve, he closed his eyes for a moment and the chants transformed “Thomas, Thomas” in his head, and it crescendoed as he barreled down some of the fastest serves of his life. Bu the first set still went the way of the experienced Grigor 7-5.\n\nGrigor expected the fight to be over after a decisive first set but unknown to him Thomas was neither deflated nor trying to motivate himself for the next set. The intensity did not abate in this second set and this caught Grigor off guard - he lost 6-4.\n\nThe crowd had turned against him now. They were behind this kid, ranked who knows what, playing his first ATP 500 semifinal taking it to the tournament favorite.\n\nThe third set went to a tie break. Grigor was on match point. As he walked up to serve, Thomas felt like he was inhabiting his body for the first time. He existed, not inside his head or in anyone else’s but on that hard court. And as he rallied against Grigor, there was nothing else. It was the longest rally of the match which ended with a backhand winner along the line from Grigor that Thomas could not get to.\n\n## Fresh Air\n\nThomas sat in a coffee shop the day after. Something about the game felt distant. He sat at a table under a tree. He experienced fleeting moments of quietness that coincided with the rustle of the leaves in the gentle summer afternoon breeze.\n\nThomas saw the girl across from him. She was scribbling on a notebook with a couple of pens around her. She smiled when she noticed Thomas. They struck up a conversation for the next 45 minutes. Thomas asked her about her art, where she started, how she got here. She asked him about what it was like being a professional player. They both agreed that there was no money is what they were doing unless they were in the top 100 of what they were doing.\n\nFor Thomas, she felt like someone who had made peace with herself. There was a sense of quiet assuredness about her that radiated. Her life felt like a work of art. He felt the need to make this moment last, maybe ask her phone number. His mind peaked ahead into what dating her might be like. Then he stood up, wished her good luck with her art, and then walked away.", "timestamp": 1636219448, "digest": "hGSEXCY7iphsoO2_N1dbGqhQRfCH4c9fMmRGMC42-sg", "contributor": "0x02Dad585640b1929d88296687918d7751717Ccaa"}
{"id": "G0AoEJ77xSh2JtVQ6j8CdBKkeQCNcEiFvCF5v20j1rI", "title": "Delimerence", "body": "## The Pill\n\n**DeLimerence XR**\n*Take One Capsule By Mouth Daily*\n\n— read the green pill bottle that Thomas was holding. This was going to change everything for him. He tried to temper his excitement by telling himself that he still had to be deliberate about his actions once he took what was inside the plastic cylinder he held. “This is not a magic bean,” he kept repeating to himself.  His first few failed attempts to pry open the bottle dampened the peak of his narrative arc a bit. After soldiering on and cursing himself, he finally held the red translucent capsule in his hand. He stared at it for a few seconds\n\n“Was this still a good idea?”\n\n“Would I get addicted to it and be unable to fall in love later in life when I want to?”\n\n“Would it somehow affect my ability to play tennis?”\n\nHe remembered something vague that he had read about how the drug affects heart rate.\n\nThe answers to his questions were on the medical information sheet that lay on the table. He did not bother to check it. He knew all that he needed to know about DeLimerence before he went to the psychiatrist.\n\nDeLimerence would stop him from feeling frantic, anxious, and out of control whenever he really liked a girl. This had held him back his whole adult life. He would like someone he met on a dating app or at a party, or for a brief moment at a coffee shop.\n\n“It could practically happen anywhere anytime,” he remembered telling the psychiatrist.\n\n“I would really unreasonably like this person and then completely lose my mind over them,” Thomas had explained when the psychiatrist had asked, “why are you here?”\n\n“I would then be unable to concentrate on my game during the matches, text her too much, become a real nervous wreck with extreme mood swings. It affected everything I did, and nothing good came out of it,” Thomas explained as he looked out the window of the psychiatrist’s office, envious of the trees that swayed gently in the wind, seemingly enjoying a better life than him.\n\nIn the middle of his explainer, Thomas noticed that he was having a hard time even making eye contact with the psychiatrist. He tried to turn his head towards the person in front of him, but his eyes landed squarely at the bottom of a bookshelf, fixating on a kitschy photo frame that read, “You are loved and important.”\n\nHe knew that the psychiatrist was just a pawn to make quick work of in the medical-industrial complex. He was going to ask him all the questions off DSM-IV, check off boxes, give him the pill.\n\n“Did you hear about any drugs for this elsewhere? Did someone recommend this to you?” the psychiatrist had asked as Thomas finished his sentence.\n\n“No,” he responded without a moment’s delay.\n\nOn the back of his mind was the subreddit r/unalovebomber that had put him onto the diagnosis he was seeking. It had been yet another torrid week. Thomas had gone on a single date with someone he met on Hinge. He had kept his cool before the date even though the long texts had built anticipation. He kept repeating his usual mantras in the shower just before the date “keep it cool, enjoy yourself, even if nothing happens, you get to enjoy someone’s company.” And then the date had gone extraordinarily well. They were both athletes - Thomas, a tennis player, ranked #400 in the world, Maddie a triathlete who worked as a nurse. They spent 6 hours talking about life, books, music, childhood stories. A day passed, Thomas held onto his nerve and did not double text, and then he got the text\n\n> You’re a great guy but I don’t think it’s a match. Hope you have a great career and make it to the top 250\n\nHe knew the drill. He had done this before and felt helpless about the fact that his baseline instincts were going to take over. Resent her, console himself by saying, “it’s her fucking loss”, watch porn and then after 4 hours when all coping mechanisms failed, weep and scream into the couch in his living room. The downstairs neighbors had filed a noise complaint the first time he cried when he moved into his new apartment, and the couch was a good acoustic cushion. After about 6 hours of this he had found new (or perhaps old) resolve to fix this once and for all and was on r/unalovebomber subreddit looking for inspiration, solutions or whatever hooked his mind. He found a post by r/epicureanjoel that he knew was going to change things and there was some sense of finality to it :\n\n> * I’ve been on DeLimerence XR for 100 days and it has completely transformed my life\\*\n> * I’ve been a 7/10 all my life, rarely had problems finding dates regularly but only met people I liked once in a while. And then when I met someone I liked, I would become a complete schizoid and show classic symptoms of a love bomber - sending too many messages, not taking any kind of negative reaction from her well, my mind would be completely out of place. Even got to the point where I almost lost a job because of this habit. Finally got diagnosed for affection processing disorder and got prescribed DeLimerance XR 10mg. I’ve been on 4 dates since starting medication, and it has gone great. I have a good time with them, don’t get anxious about text replies and you know what? 3 of those 4 dates have gone well, I’m still seeing them. Something about me being more cool and aloof about it definitely makes me more attractive to them and to myself. Don’t fall for the temporary displacement of ego that instant attraction or “love at first sight” offers. Get diagnosed and work on yourself.\\*\n\nIt all came down to this moment now. Thomas had read that it takes anywhere between 30 minutes to one hour for DeLimerence XR to take effect. The most common dosage instruction on r/unalovebomber was to take it when you were actively dating. It was Friday, and Thomas had a few matches on his dating app that he had not initiated conversations with. He was also planning to go to a house concert with a friend, Vijayan, in the evening. ‘Friend’ was too generous a definition for their relationship. Men who are in their 30s don’t have friends. Their lives are like airports, people come and go, stay awhile, make conversation, but eventually, they leave like they originally intended to.\n\nThomas felt an easiness about texting the girls on the app. Not excited, not nervous and on edge. Not craving approval like he always used to. He even flirted when they replied back. He had a picture of him wearing a t-shirt based on the PT Anderson movie There Will Be Blood, and someone he matched with commented.\n\n“Nice t-shirt btw. I love that movie.”\n\nAnd Thomas, to his own surprise, had replied “Haha who knows may be you’ll get to wear it someday”.\n\n2 hours in, he tried to cast doubt over the effect of the medicine, maybe he had just convinced himself that the pill works, and nothing substantial had actually changed in his brain chemistry. But he also did not want to find out. He liked the way it felt and planned to continue to do so. He tried to remember the names of the girls on the dating app he had ended up making plans with and could not remember. “Doesn’t matter. I have plans with them and it’s just a first date anyway,” he told himself. It was time to find out whether this drug helped with social anxiety when talking with women.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Club\n\nThomas was meeting Vijayan at the club where the House concert was happening. Vijayan was a gay Indian American that his first generation immigrant parents were proud of. He had gone through  all the layers of professional success that Asian immigrant parents could think of - graduating from Carnegie Mellon, a Harvard MBA with consulting experience in the big three, stock in a Silicon Valley company that went public a year ago. He had defeated all of his parents’ expectations. So complete was his victory that when Vijayan went home to visit them, they let him sleep in the master bedroom while they slept in the guest room. But despite all this, he struggled with relationships, often ending up in ones were he was physically abused. Thomas understood that they hung out despite being part of different social classes because of this love sickness that they shared. It came with perks such as free tickets to a Tiesto concert or regular refills of Ketamine, the good kind.\n\nAs the Uber pulled up to the club, Thomas reminded himself not to talk about taking DeLimerence. He kept telling himself that this was an intimate detail that no one needed to know about him. Yet, on some level he was also ashamed that he needed a drug to feel the way normal humans probably felt and operated.\n\n“Thomas, you look different today. Did you shave?” Vijayan asked as he caught Thomas just as he was scanning his ticket.\n\nThomas chuckled nervously. Had he been found out already, “Hey man, I guess so? Your shirt looks great btw”. A compliment was always an excellent way to deflect attention from oneself.\n\nAs they walked into the club, Thomas thought about how he would not choose this experience if he was single. It was too loud, there too many people, and everyone was trying hard to signal how hot they were and how they were different from their peers by 15% but not more. He was certain this was a feeling shared by others in the club as well, just that it was masked by whatever drug they were on or the affection they felt from the person standing next to them, sometimes a friend, sometimes a partner. He scanned around to see who he could talk to while Vijayan hovered around making conversation. He could sense that Vijayan was becoming more inebriated with each sentence that rolled out of his tongue, and within an hour or so he would just be an animated object that sometimes spoke gibberish for Thomas’s amusement.\n\nThere was a tall blonde girl wearing a short white dress drinking at the bar, away from everyone else. He considered her for a moment and his brain made the calculation within 5 seconds that she was perhaps too ambitious a target for understanding the effects of DeLimerence.\n\nHe instead squared in on the girl wearing a black crop and black high waist jeans, with long curly black hair. She was in a corner, holding a beer, she looked like an amused rabbit to Thomas. As he sipped his drink while standing next to her, Thomas examined his emotional state for a moment. His heart was quiet, he didn’t feel like his mind was racing, there were no indicators of fear. He felt euphoric and on a mission. He turned to her a couple of times, waiting for a moment where they made eye contact, and when it happened on the third try, he said “nice necklace, quite classic.”\n\n“Aw thanks. Well, funny story, I found it in an abandoned car near my house,” she replied, smiling. He could feel that her brain was quickly registering him and his body language.\n\nPerfect. Thomas thought to himself. She had responded with something to latch onto, and the conversation could now go places. As their conversation continued, Thomas would drift away in his head for moments in between to examine how he felt about    Remy, the woman he was talking to. He thought he was holding her at a distance and like he knew where the conversation was going to go next and where to take it. This was a new and interesting sensation for Thomas, who usually found himself blank when he was smitten by someone - it was not that he did not have anything to ask or say. In fact, it was that his mind was traveling at 100 mph, trying to narrow down on a single thing from the myriad of thoughts that flew by.\n\n“So is this what you do on Fridays? Smooth talk women in dim-lit clubs?” Remy asked.\n\nThomas smirked, put his hand to his chest and replied, “Aww I’m heartbroken that you think that of me while here I am thinking I don’t run into interesting people like you”, and ran his palm on the inside of her elbow. What he said would have been true a week before, but not today. Today it felt like a lie, and he felt okay with it. This what be must courtship means to people now, he thought as he felt Remy standing closer to him.\n\nThere comes a moment in time while at a club where the effect of drugs and the music crescendo and everyone feels like they share a fleeting communal moment. After that peak, things tend to go downhill. As this moment approached, Thomas was further sure that he was going home with Remy tonight. He looked around for Vijayan and saw him standing against the bar, drink in his hand, his eyes looking like they were searching for something, perhaps trying to find the last ounce of energy in him to co-ordinate the movement of his body. Thomas, for the first time since they started hanging out, felt terrible for Vijayan. He even detested him a bit. “I guess hanging out with people like this is why I never had any luck with women,” he thought to himself.\n\n“Bunch of fucking beta cucks,” he thought as he planted his lips on Remy’s while gripping her close.\n\nWhen they had sex at Remy’s place, Thomas did not feel like he was falling in love or incredibly attracted to her. The sex was fine. Thomas never took deep pleasure from it except for the one time he was in a two-year relationship. It felt mechanical, but he felt powerful if it elicited reactions from the woman he was with, so that is what he focussed on. He was glad that he did not feel like staying for long after like he usually did, lingering on in the aftermath, hoping there is something deeper there. He felt cured.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Court\n\nThomas was playing the best tennis of his life.\n\nHe was in the quarterfinal of an ATP 500 tournament for the first time in his life.\n\nEvery time he got knocked out of the tournament, his coach said, “You need to be ruthless. You need a bit more of that fuck you attitude that the best players have”. He felt that in his approach on court in this tournament, he would not let it up now. He had won the last game 6-0, 6-1 and let out a guttural war cry at the end of the game. The crowd booed, but Thomas felt invigorated by being the hated one for once, not the nice guy. “Like the best in the business”, he thought to himself.\n\nToday he was up against world number 105 Felix Oviedo. As he warmed up for the game, he thought about the last three weeks since he started DeLimerence XR. He had been with three women, all three of whom he left on read. He liked to think the control he felt reflected elsewhere, including his game. He was not wrong. DeLimerence had made him more ruthless, calculated in unexplainable ways. “You never know how its going to affect you until you take. Different people have different results” read a user’s post on r/UnaLovebomber\n\nAs he warmed up for the game, he saw Felix walk into the court. He was accompanied by his coach and a woman who looked like his girlfriend. She was above average height for a woman, wearing a flowing dark blue dress that stopped above her knee, a white hat, and round green sunglasses. She stood by Felix as he talked with his coach, running her palm over his shoulders, brushing something off his face. They exchanged glances often, sometimes pecking each other on the lips. Thomas was distracted and annoyed by this. He felt something inside him sink, a feeling that he had not experienced since he started DeLimerence. He took a few deep breaths and tried to remember if he had taken DeLimerence today. He clearly remembered the green bottle in his hand about an hour ago. He felt this moment would pass, so he resumed his training, trying to focus on finding the middle of the racket with every hit. Fourth shot of a new rally with his went flying into the stands. Mishits happen. He reset himself with a few more bounces of the ball and glances at his watch. The next three returns sprayed across the court - two of them going too far and one hitting the net.\n\n“Calm down Thoma” his French coach urged from the other side.\n\nAs he walked out the court, yielding the rest of the time to Felix for his warm-up, he glanced at the couple who were sharing an embrace, and Thomas felt defeated.\n\nHe sat in the dressing room 20 minutes before the game, wondering what had hit him. His mind was racing again and seemed like it was searching for reasons to explain this. When he remembered that he had no one with him except for the coach he was paying to be there, he felt a sense of inevitability. The return of the same memories, like a fly stuck to honey. Thomas was not going to give up now. This was his moment, and he had to make it last. His body had been under stress throughout the tournament, and it needed more replenishment than it usually did. Perhaps it applied to DeLimerence too. The current dosage did not have the desired effect.  There was no great conflict in coming to this decision, so he took another 10mg pill of DeLimerence XR 10 minutes before he went on court.\n\nThe game with Felix was harder than his last.  The first set went to Felix. The second went to the tie break. Thomas was on set point. He reset his mind by remembering Tchivosky overture 1812. The music peaked in Thomas’s head as he brought the ball to the racket and raised his hands to serve for the set. He heard a “Cmon Felix” from behind him when he released the ball but Thomas felt an easiness come over his body, and his racket swung down on the ball, and he knew he had hit an ace the moment the ball hit the sweet spot. Felix did not move. Thomas did not feel the need to. Instead, he turned around to where the words of encouragement had come from. It was the girlfriend. He pumped his fist and then drummed it against his chest while looking directly at her. The match was won in that moment. The next set finished 6-2 in Thomas’s favor. He had made it to the semifinal of an ATP 500 tournament.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Hotel\n\nIt had been 6 hours since he took the second 10mg pill. He was going to feel the effect of the drug well into the night. Thomas was about to head out to get dinner. He expanded his chest as he looked at himself in the mirror. He stared into his reflection and could not recognize the fierceness in the eyes of the person that stared back at him. He usually rested after games, nursing wounds, doing plyometric exercises to get in shape for the next game, which was tomorrow. But today, he wanted to go out. He needed to be with a woman and wanted the world to know he could have anyone he wants at this moment.\n\nGoing alone to dinner was something he rarely did, and never at a restaurant with $$$ on Google maps. As the waitress guided him to a table, he noticed no one at the bar counter seats except for a woman wearing a white summer dress with a low back cut. He asked the waitress if he could be seated at the bar instead and moved in that direction before the waitress could respond. He glanced in the direction of the woman as he sat two seats away from her and smiled at her when she looked to see who had decided to dare to disturb her solitude.\n\nThe bar tables overlooked the ocean through floor-to-ceiling glass windows. The restaurant was on the 3rd floor, and at Thomas’s eye line, it seemed as if the restaurant was floating on the ocean. The last tinge of yellow of the sun refracted through the bottles of alcohol lined up a 30-foot shelf.\n\nThe waitress had taken his order, and the bartender had turned away after taking an order for an old fashioned from the woman in white. Thomas saw the opportunity for an opening.\n\n“So you’re a fellow whiskey lover?” He asked.\n\nShe turned to Thomas, smiled assuredly and replied, “Is that the best opening line that you’ve got?”.\n\nThomas was not fluttered the least by it. He had got good or at least felt good about dealing with volleys such as this one.\n\n“Would you rather talk about how beautiful the weather is, or should I remark on the beauty of the ocean?” He replied without taking his eye off hers.\n\nShe looked away before he did, into the glass in front of her “sorry, I didn’t mean to be rude, I’m Sarah, and yes, I do love a good whiskey,” she said as she raised the glass towards him.\n\n“I’m Thomas. I love a good whiskey too, especially today,” Thomas replied, leaving it open for a question.\n\n“What happened today?”\n\n“Just won a game of tennis,” Thomas said, with understatement in his voice.\n\n“Are you a tennis player?”\n\n“Yes,” replied Thomas as he noticed that Sarah had shifted her body towards him and was looking at his face intently, searching for something. Thomas mistook this for interest so he continued, “Playing someone ranked 51st in the world tomorrow actually.”\n\nSarah interrupted the conversation.\n\n“Sorry. Are you on DeLimerence?” She asked.\n\nThomas gulped and flashbacked to the experience he had had before he starting taking Delimerence - one of his mind traveling at an enormous speed trying to find a response that would make him feel less judged. But nothing bubbled up to the top of his mind to fill the void in the nick of time.\n\n“How did you know” he finally replied, almost defeated but not showing it on his face.\n\n“You have that look in your eyes,” Sarah replied, feeling slightly guilty that she had brought it up.\n\nThomas was staring at his drink and then into the ocean.\n\n“It’s alright, I’m on it too,” she replied, hoping it would soften the blow.\n\nThis piqued his head. “You’re on DeLimerence? Have you been with someone on DeLimerence before?” Thomas asked.\n\n“No, why would I want to be with someone who’s just like me?” She replied and then chuckled as she ended that sentence.\n\nThomas wondered why the effect of DeLimerence was not working at this moment. Was it a placebo all this while? He felt like he needed to impress this woman so that she would go home with him and at the same time resented her.\n\n“What is this look in my eyes that you noticed?” Thomas asked as he composed himself and looked Sarah in the eyes. The sounds of the bar, the conversations, clinking glasses came into sharp focus as he asked this.\n\n“The look of deep amusement with yourself and how you are.”\n\n“Like you’d fall in love with your reflection any moment now.”\n\nThomas crumbled. He wanted to yell at her, maybe even hit her. He looks at his palms that were face down on the table. They were trembling, with anxiety or anger. Thomas was not sure.\n\nHe continued eating and finishing his drink while he and Sarah both sat in the quietness of the bar counter. When it turned dark, the ocean was not visible anymore. It seemed that nothing existed outside of the window. Just an unassuming void.\n\nSarah got up to leave first and glanced at Thomas, who never lifted his head up. She walked out. Thomas could hear the sound of her heels moving further away. He felt relieved for a moment. And then he started ruminating on the game tomorrow.\n\n“What if DeLimerence does not work anymore? It does not seem to have any effect in this moment,” he thought to himself.\n\nHe felt a cold wave build up in his head like his nerves were tingling against his skull, and this sensation washed across his spine, and he felt his eyes well up, like he had no control over it. Finally, he brought himself back to the moment and collected himself enough to pay the check.\n\nA cool evening breeze hit his face as he walked out of the restaurant. For a couple of seconds, after he forgot where he had been and what had just transpired, a sense of peace crept in, only to be violently jolted out of it by an intrusive thought, “Wish I could share this with someone.” His mind and body were pulling him in opposite directions, one racing ahead and the other crashing down. Thomas held his nerve till he got to his hotel room, and then as soon as the door was closed behind him, he collapsed on the ground face first. He felt his chest heaving and a scream building up in his throat, and he let it out. He felt tears rushing down his cheeks.\n\nAt this moment, his inner voice reverted to what it had been taught as a child. “Why don’t you go fucking kill yourself” it demanded, and Thomas wailed harder to drown out the voice. Until his body was tired and could not generate any more thoughts.\n\nThere is a sense of clarity that fills the space that fills the space of sadness once it has left the body. The first lucid thought told Thomas that he would probably kill himself if he goes through a similar evening again. He had read about DeLimerence crashes on r/UnaLoveBomber.\n\nThomas had given up. DeLimerence was not going to save him. The game with world number 51 was lost before it had begun.\n\n## Let it go\n\nThomas looked around and saw people trickle into the stadium. This would be the biggest crowd he had played in front of, and it did not mean anything to him. He could feel the texture of the handle of the racket in his hand, his breath against his nostrils, foot firm yet nimble and ready to move. As he hit back ball after ball that his coach served him, he felt he had more time than ever before. Every ball seemed to be hitting the racket’s sweet spot, yet it was not bringing him the dopamine hits it usually did.  It just was.\n\nWhen the match began, the crowd was on the side of tournament favorite and world number 51 Grigor Milov. Thomas could hear chants of “Grigor, Grigor” as he lined up to serve, he closed his eyes for a moment and the chants transformed “Thomas, Thomas” in his head, and it crescendoed as he barreled down some of the fastest serves of his life. Bu the first set still went the way of the experienced Grigor 7-5.\n\nGrigor expected the fight to be over after a decisive first set but unknown to him Thomas was neither deflated nor trying to motivate himself for the next set. The intensity did not abate in this second set and this caught Grigor off guard - he lost 6-4.\n\nThe crowd had turned against him now. They were behind this kid, ranked who knows what, playing his first ATP 500 semifinal taking it to the tournament favorite.\n\nThe third set went to a tie break. Grigor was on match point. As he walked up to serve, Thomas felt like he was inhabiting his body for the first time. He existed, not inside his head or in anyone else’s but on that hard court. And as he rallied against Grigor, there was nothing else. It was the longest rally of the match which ended with a backhand winner along the line from Grigor that Thomas could not get to.\n\n## Fresh Air\n\nThomas sat in a coffee shop the day after. Something about the game felt distant. He sat at a table under a tree. He experienced fleeting moments of quietness that coincided with the rustle of the leaves in the gentle summer afternoon breeze.\n\nThomas saw the girl across from him. She was scribbling on a notebook with a couple of pens around her. She smiled when she noticed Thomas. They struck up a conversation for the next 45 minutes. Thomas asked her about her art, where she started, how she got here. She asked him about what it was like being a professional player. They both agreed that there was no money is what they were doing unless they were in the top 100 of what they were doing.\n\nFor Thomas, she felt like someone who had made peace with herself. There was a sense of quiet assuredness about her that radiated. Her life felt like a work of art. He felt the need to make this moment last, maybe ask her phone number. His mind peaked ahead into what dating her might be like.

{"id": "qQHgKlGeWVxWKbVWkIgoerC3z-FqWNRgs2Bj5sQnEow", "title": "Delimerence", "body": "## The Pill\n\n**DeLimerence XR**\n*Take One Capsule By Mouth Daily*\n\n— read the green pill bottle that Thomas was holding. This was going to change everything for him. He tried to temper his excitement by telling himself that he still had to be deliberate about his actions once he took what was inside the plastic cylinder he held. “This is not a magic bean,” he kept repeating to himself.  His first few failed attempts to pry open the bottle dampened the peak of his narrative arc a bit. After soldiering on and cursing himself, he finally held the red translucent capsule in his hand. He stared at it for a few seconds\n\n“Was this still a good idea?”\n\n“Would I get addicted to it and be unable to fall in love later in life when I want to?”\n\n“Would it somehow affect my ability to play tennis?”\n\nHe remembered something vague that he had read about how the drug affects heart rate.\n\nThe answers to his questions were on the medical information sheet that lay on the table. He did not bother to check it. He knew all that he needed to know about DeLimerence before he went to the psychiatrist.\n\nDeLimerence would stop him from feeling frantic, anxious, and out of control whenever he really liked a girl. This had held him back his whole adult life. He would like someone he met on a dating app or at a party, or for a brief moment at a coffee shop.\n\n“It could practically happen anywhere anytime,” he remembered telling the psychiatrist.\n\n“I would really unreasonably like this person and then completely lose my mind over them,” Thomas had explained when the psychiatrist had asked, “why are you here?”\n\n“I would then be unable to concentrate on my game during the matches, text her too much, become a real nervous wreck with extreme mood swings. It affected everything I did, and nothing good came out of it,” Thomas explained as he looked out the window of the psychiatrist’s office, envious of the trees that swayed gently in the wind, seemingly enjoying a better life than him.\n\nIn the middle of his explainer, Thomas noticed that he was having a hard time even making eye contact with the psychiatrist. He tried to turn his head towards the person in front of him, but his eyes landed squarely at the bottom of a bookshelf, fixating on a kitschy photo frame that read, “You are loved and important.”\n\nHe knew that the psychiatrist was just a pawn to make quick work of in the medical-industrial complex. He was going to ask him all the questions off DSM-IV, check off boxes, give him the pill.\n\n“Did you hear about any drugs for this elsewhere? Did someone recommend this to you?” the psychiatrist had asked as Thomas finished his sentence.\n\n“No,” he responded without a moment’s delay.\n\nOn the back of his mind was the subreddit r/unalovebomber that had put him onto the diagnosis he was seeking. It had been yet another torrid week. Thomas had gone on a single date with someone he met on Hinge. He had kept his cool before the date even though the long texts had built anticipation. He kept repeating his usual mantras in the shower just before the date “keep it cool, enjoy yourself, even if nothing happens, you get to enjoy someone’s company.” And then the date had gone extraordinarily well. They were both athletes - Thomas, a tennis player, ranked #400 in the world, Maddie a triathlete who worked as a nurse. They spent 6 hours talking about life, books, music, childhood stories. A day passed, Thomas held onto his nerve and did not double text, and then he got the text\n\n> You’re a great guy but I don’t think it’s a match. Hope you have a great career and make it to the top 250\n\nHe knew the drill. He had done this before and felt helpless about the fact that his baseline instincts were going to take over. Resent her, console himself by saying, “it’s her fucking loss”, watch porn and then after 4 hours when all coping mechanisms failed, weep and scream into the couch in his living room. The downstairs neighbors had filed a noise complaint the first time he cried when he moved into his new apartment, and the couch was a good acoustic cushion. After about 6 hours of this he had found new (or perhaps old) resolve to fix this once and for all and was on r/unalovebomber subreddit looking for inspiration, solutions or whatever hooked his mind. He found a post by r/epicureanjoel that he knew was going to change things and there was some sense of finality to it :\n\n> * I’ve been on DeLimerence XR for 100 days and it has completely transformed my life\\*\n> * I’ve been a 7/10 all my life, rarely had problems finding dates regularly but only met people I liked once in a while. And then when I met someone I liked, I would become a complete schizoid and show classic symptoms of a love bomber - sending too many messages, not taking any kind of negative reaction from her well, my mind would be completely out of place. Even got to the point where I almost lost a job because of this habit. Finally got diagnosed for affection processing disorder and got prescribed DeLimerance XR 10mg. I’ve been on 4 dates since starting medication, and it has gone great. I have a good time with them, don’t get anxious about text replies and you know what? 3 of those 4 dates have gone well, I’m still seeing them. Something about me being more cool and aloof about it definitely makes me more attractive to them and to myself. Don’t fall for the temporary displacement of ego that instant attraction or “love at first sight” offers. Get diagnosed and work on yourself.\\*\n\nIt all came down to this moment now. Thomas had read that it takes anywhere between 30 minutes to one hour for DeLimerence XR to take effect. The most common dosage instruction on r/unalovebomber was to take it when you were actively dating. It was Friday, and Thomas had a few matches on his dating app that he had not initiated conversations with. He was also planning to go to a house concert with a friend, Vijayan, in the evening. ‘Friend’ was too generous a definition for their relationship. Men who are in their 30s don’t have friends. Their lives are like airports, people come and go, stay awhile, make conversation, but eventually, they leave like they originally intended to.\n\nThomas felt an easiness about texting the girls on the app. Not excited, not nervous and on edge. Not craving approval like he always used to. He even flirted when they replied back. He had a picture of him wearing a t-shirt based on the PT Anderson movie There Will Be Blood, and someone he matched with commented.\n\n“Nice t-shirt btw. I love that movie.”\n\nAnd Thomas, to his own surprise, had replied “Haha who knows may be you’ll get to wear it someday”.\n\n2 hours in, he tried to cast doubt over the effect of the medicine, maybe he had just convinced himself that the pill works, and nothing substantial had actually changed in his brain chemistry. But he also did not want to find out. He liked the way it felt and planned to continue to do so. He tried to remember the names of the girls on the dating app he had ended up making plans with and could not remember. “Doesn’t matter. I have plans with them and it’s just a first date anyway,” he told himself. It was time to find out whether this drug helped with social anxiety when talking with women.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Club\n\nThomas was meeting Vijayan at the club where the House concert was happening. Vijayan was a gay Indian American that his first generation immigrant parents were proud of. He had gone through  all the layers of professional success that Asian immigrant parents could think of - graduating from Carnegie Mellon, a Harvard MBA with consulting experience in the big three, stock in a Silicon Valley company that went public a year ago. He had defeated all of his parents’ expectations. So complete was his victory that when Vijayan went home to visit them, they let him sleep in the master bedroom while they slept in the guest room. But despite all this, he struggled with relationships, often ending up in ones were he was physically abused. Thomas understood that they hung out despite being part of different social classes because of this love sickness that they shared. It came with perks such as free tickets to a Tiesto concert or regular refills of Ketamine, the good kind.\n\nAs the Uber pulled up to the club, Thomas reminded himself not to talk about taking DeLimerence. He kept telling himself that this was an intimate detail that no one needed to know about him. Yet, on some level he was also ashamed that he needed a drug to feel the way normal humans probably felt and operated.\n\n“Thomas, you look different today. Did you shave?” Vijayan asked as he caught Thomas just as he was scanning his ticket.\n\nThomas chuckled nervously. Had he been found out already, “Hey man, I guess so? Your shirt looks great btw”. A compliment was always an excellent way to deflect attention from oneself.\n\nAs they walked into the club, Thomas thought about how he would not choose this experience if he was single. It was too loud, there too many people, and everyone was trying hard to signal how hot they were and how they were different from their peers by 15% but not more. He was certain this was a feeling shared by others in the club as well, just that it was masked by whatever drug they were on or the affection they felt from the person standing next to them, sometimes a friend, sometimes a partner. He scanned around to see who he could talk to while Vijayan hovered around making conversation. He could sense that Vijayan was becoming more inebriated with each sentence that rolled out of his tongue, and within an hour or so he would just be an animated object that sometimes spoke gibberish for Thomas’s amusement.\n\nThere was a tall blonde girl wearing a short white dress drinking at the bar, away from everyone else. He considered her for a moment and his brain made the calculation within 5 seconds that she was perhaps too ambitious a target for understanding the effects of DeLimerence.\n\nHe instead squared in on the girl wearing a black crop and black high waist jeans, with long curly black hair. She was in a corner, holding a beer, she looked like an amused rabbit to Thomas. As he sipped his drink while standing next to her, Thomas examined his emotional state for a moment. His heart was quiet, he didn’t feel like his mind was racing, there were no indicators of fear. He felt euphoric and on a mission. He turned to her a couple of times, waiting for a moment where they made eye contact, and when it happened on the third try, he said “nice necklace, quite classic.”\n\n“Aw thanks. Well, funny story, I found it in an abandoned car near my house,” she replied, smiling. He could feel that her brain was quickly registering him and his body language.\n\nPerfect. Thomas thought to himself. She had responded with something to latch onto, and the conversation could now go places. As their conversation continued, Thomas would drift away in his head for moments in between to examine how he felt about    Remy, the woman he was talking to. He thought he was holding her at a distance and like he knew where the conversation was going to go next and where to take it. This was a new and interesting sensation for Thomas, who usually found himself blank when he was smitten by someone - it was not that he did not have anything to ask or say. In fact, it was that his mind was traveling at 100 mph, trying to narrow down on a single thing from the myriad of thoughts that flew by.\n\n“So is this what you do on Fridays? Smooth talk women in dim-lit clubs?” Remy asked.\n\nThomas smirked, put his hand to his chest and replied, “Aww I’m heartbroken that you think that of me while here I am thinking I don’t run into interesting people like you”, and ran his palm on the inside of her elbow. What he said would have been true a week before, but not today. Today it felt like a lie, and he felt okay with it. This what be must courtship means to people now, he thought as he felt Remy standing closer to him.\n\nThere comes a moment in time while at a club where the effect of drugs and the music crescendo and everyone feels like they share a fleeting communal moment. After that peak, things tend to go downhill. As this moment approached, Thomas was further sure that he was going home with Remy tonight. He looked around for Vijayan and saw him standing against the bar, drink in his hand, his eyes looking like they were searching for something, perhaps trying to find the last ounce of energy in him to co-ordinate the movement of his body. Thomas, for the first time since they started hanging out, felt terrible for Vijayan. He even detested him a bit. “I guess hanging out with people like this is why I never had any luck with women,” he thought to himself.\n\n“Bunch of fucking beta cucks,” he thought as he planted his lips on Remy’s while gripping her close.\n\nWhen they had sex at Remy’s place, Thomas did not feel like he was falling in love or incredibly attracted to her. The sex was fine. Thomas never took deep pleasure from it except for the one time he was in a two-year relationship. It felt mechanical, but he felt powerful if it elicited reactions from the woman he was with, so that is what he focussed on. He was glad that he did not feel like staying for long after like he usually did, lingering on in the aftermath, hoping there is something deeper there. He felt cured.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Court\n\nThomas was playing the best tennis of his life.\n\nHe was in the quarterfinal of an ATP 500 tournament for the first time in his life.\n\nEvery time he got knocked out of the tournament, his coach said, “You need to be ruthless. You need a bit more of that fuck you attitude that the best players have”. He felt that in his approach on court in this tournament, he would not let it up now. He had won the last game 6-0, 6-1 and let out a guttural war cry at the end of the game. The crowd booed, but Thomas felt invigorated by being the hated one for once, not the nice guy. “Like the best in the business”, he thought to himself.\n\nToday he was up against world number 105 Felix Oviedo. As he warmed up for the game, he thought about the last three weeks since he started DeLimerence XR. He had been with three women, all three of whom he left on read. He liked to think the control he felt reflected elsewhere, including his game. He was not wrong. DeLimerence had made him more ruthless, calculated in unexplainable ways. “You never know how its going to affect you until you take. Different people have different results” read a user’s post on r/UnaLovebomber\n\nAs he warmed up for the game, he saw Felix walk into the court. He was accompanied by his coach and a woman who looked like his girlfriend. She was above average height for a woman, wearing a flowing dark blue dress that stopped above her knee, a white hat, and round green sunglasses. She stood by Felix as he talked with his coach, running her palm over his shoulders, brushing something off his face. They exchanged glances often, sometimes pecking each other on the lips. Thomas was distracted and annoyed by this. He felt something inside him sink, a feeling that he had not experienced since he started DeLimerence. He took a few deep breaths and tried to remember if he had taken DeLimerence today. He clearly remembered the green bottle in his hand about an hour ago. He felt this moment would pass, so he resumed his training, trying to focus on finding the middle of the racket with every hit. Fourth shot of a new rally with his went flying into the stands. Mishits happen. He reset himself with a few more bounces of the ball and glances at his watch. The next three returns sprayed across the court - two of them going too far and one hitting the net.\n\n“Calm down Thoma” his French coach urged from the other side.\n\nAs he walked out the court, yielding the rest of the time to Felix for his warm-up, he glanced at the couple who were sharing an embrace, and Thomas felt defeated.\n\nHe sat in the dressing room 20 minutes before the game, wondering what had hit him. His mind was racing again and seemed like it was searching for reasons to explain this. When he remembered that he had no one with him except for the coach he was paying to be there, he felt a sense of inevitability. The return of the same memories, like a fly stuck to honey. Thomas was not going to give up now. This was his moment, and he had to make it last. His body had been under stress throughout the tournament, and it needed more replenishment than it usually did. Perhaps it applied to DeLimerence too. The current dosage did not have the desired effect.  There was no great conflict in coming to this decision, so he took another 10mg pill of DeLimerence XR 10 minutes before he went on court.\n\nThe game with Felix was harder than his last.  The first set went to Felix. The second went to the tie break. Thomas was on set point. He reset his mind by remembering Tchivosky overture 1812. The music peaked in Thomas’s head as he brought the ball to the racket and raised his hands to serve for the set. He heard a “Cmon Felix” from behind him when he released the ball but Thomas felt an easiness come over his body, and his racket swung down on the ball, and he knew he had hit an ace the moment the ball hit the sweet spot. Felix did not move. Thomas did not feel the need to. Instead, he turned around to where the words of encouragement had come from. It was the girlfriend. He pumped his fist and then drummed it against his chest while looking directly at her. The match was won in that moment. The next set finished 6-2 in Thomas’s favor. He had made it to the semifinal of an ATP 500 tournament.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Hotel\n\nIt had been 6 hours since he took the second 10mg pill. He was going to feel the effect of the drug well into the night. Thomas was about to head out to get dinner. He expanded his chest as he looked at himself in the mirror. He stared into his reflection and could not recognize the fierceness in the eyes of the person that stared back at him. He usually rested after games, nursing wounds, doing plyometric exercises to get in shape for the next game, which was tomorrow. But today, he wanted to go out. He needed to be with a woman and wanted the world to know he could have anyone he wants at this moment.\n\nGoing alone to dinner was something he rarely did, and never at a restaurant with $$$ on Google maps. As the waitress guided him to a table, he noticed no one at the bar counter seats except for a woman wearing a white summer dress with a low back cut. He asked the waitress if he could be seated at the bar instead and moved in that direction before the waitress could respond. He glanced in the direction of the woman as he sat two seats away from her and smiled at her when she looked to see who had decided to dare to disturb her solitude.\n\nThe bar tables overlooked the ocean through floor-to-ceiling glass windows. The restaurant was on the 3rd floor, and at Thomas’s eye line, it seemed as if the restaurant was floating on the ocean. The last tinge of yellow of the sun refracted through the bottles of alcohol lined up a 30-foot shelf.\n\nThe waitress had taken his order, and the bartender had turned away after taking an order for an old fashioned from the woman in white. Thomas saw the opportunity for an opening.\n\n“So you’re a fellow whiskey lover?” He asked.\n\nShe turned to Thomas, smiled assuredly and replied, “Is that the best opening line that you’ve got?”.\n\nThomas was not fluttered the least by it. He had got good or at least felt good about dealing with volleys such as this one.\n\n“Would you rather talk about how beautiful the weather is, or should I remark on the beauty of the ocean?” He replied without taking his eye off hers.\n\nShe looked away before he did, into the glass in front of her “sorry, I didn’t mean to be rude, I’m Sarah, and yes, I do love a good whiskey,” she said as she raised the glass towards him.\n\n“I’m Thomas. I love a good whiskey too, especially today,” Thomas replied, leaving it open for a question.\n\n“What happened today?”\n\n“Just won a game of tennis,” Thomas said, with understatement in his voice.\n\n“Are you a tennis player?”\n\n“Yes,” replied Thomas as he noticed that Sarah had shifted her body towards him and was looking at his face intently, searching for something. Thomas mistook this for interest so he continued, “Playing someone ranked 51st in the world tomorrow actually.”\n\nSarah interrupted the conversation.\n\n“Sorry. Are you on DeLimerence?” She asked.\n\nThomas gulped and flashbacked to the experience he had had before he starting taking Delimerence - one of his mind traveling at an enormous speed trying to find a response that would make him feel less judged. But nothing bubbled up to the top of his mind to fill the void in the nick of time.\n\n“How did you know” he finally replied, almost defeated but not showing it on his face.\n\n“You have that look in your eyes,” Sarah replied, feeling slightly guilty that she had brought it up.\n\nThomas was staring at his drink and then into the ocean.\n\n“It’s alright, I’m on it too,” she replied, hoping it would soften the blow.\n\nThis piqued his head. “You’re on DeLimerence? Have you been with someone on DeLimerence before?” Thomas asked.\n\n“No, why would I want to be with someone who’s just like me?” She replied and then chuckled as she ended that sentence.\n\nThomas wondered why the effect of DeLimerence was not working at this moment. Was it a placebo all this while? He felt like he needed to impress this woman so that she would go home with him and at the same time resented her.\n\n“What is this look in my eyes that you noticed?” Thomas asked as he composed himself and looked Sarah in the eyes. The sounds of the bar, the conversations, clinking glasses came into sharp focus as he asked this.\n\n“The look of deep amusement with yourself and how you are.”\n\n“Like you’d fall in love with your reflection any moment now.”\n\nThomas crumbled. He wanted to yell at her, maybe even hit her. He looks at his palms that were face down on the table. They were trembling, with anxiety or anger. Thomas was not sure.\n\nHe continued eating and finishing his drink while he and Sarah both sat in the quietness of the bar counter. When it turned dark, the ocean was not visible anymore. It seemed that nothing existed outside of the window. Just an unassuming void.\n\nSarah got up to leave first and glanced at Thomas, who never lifted his head up. She walked out. Thomas could hear the sound of her heels moving further away. He felt relieved for a moment. And then he started ruminating on the game tomorrow.\n\n“What if DeLimerence does not work anymore? It does not seem to have any effect in this moment,” he thought to himself.\n\nHe felt a cold wave build up in his head like his nerves were tingling against his skull, and this sensation washed across his spine, and he felt his eyes well up, like he had no control over it. Finally, he brought himself back to the moment and collected himself enough to pay the check.\n\nA cool evening breeze hit his face as he walked out of the restaurant. For a couple of seconds, after he forgot where he had been and what had just transpired, a sense of peace crept in, only to be violently jolted out of it by an intrusive thought, “Wish I could share this with someone.” His mind and body were pulling him in opposite directions, one racing ahead and the other crashing down. Thomas held his nerve till he got to his hotel room, and then as soon as the door was closed behind him, he collapsed on the ground face first. He felt his chest heaving and a scream building up in his throat, and he let it out. He felt tears rushing down his cheeks.\n\nAt this moment, his inner voice reverted to what it had been taught as a child. “Why don’t you go fucking kill yourself” it demanded, and Thomas wailed harder to drown out the voice. Until his body was tired and could not generate any more thoughts.\n\nThere is a sense of clarity that fills the space that fills the space of sadness once it has left the body. The first lucid thought told Thomas that he would probably kill himself if he goes through a similar evening again. He had read about DeLimerence crashes on r/UnaLoveBomber.\n\nThomas had given up. DeLimerence was not going to save him. The game with world number 51 was lost before it had begun.\n\n## Let it go\n\nThomas looked around and saw people trickle into the stadium. This would be the biggest crowd he had played in front of, and it did not mean anything to him. He could feel the texture of the handle of the racket in his hand, his breath against his nostrils, foot firm yet nimble and ready to move. As he hit back ball after ball that his coach served him, he felt he had more time than ever before. Every ball seemed to be hitting the racket’s sweet spot, yet it was not bringing him the dopamine hits it usually did.  It just was.\n\nWhen the match began, the crowd was on the side of tournament favorite and world number 51 Grigor Milov. Thomas could hear chants of “Grigor, Grigor” as he lined up to serve, he closed his eyes for a moment and the chants transformed “Thomas, Thomas” in his head, and it crescendoed as he barreled down some of the fastest serves of his life. Bu the first set still went the way of the experienced Grigor 7-5.\n\nGrigor expected the fight to be over after a decisive first set but unknown to him Thomas was neither deflated nor trying to motivate himself for the next set. The intensity did not abate in this second set and this caught Grigor off guard - he lost 6-4.\n\nThe crowd had turned against him now. They were behind this kid, ranked who knows what, playing his first ATP 500 semifinal taking it to the tournament favorite.\n\nThe third set went to a tie break. Grigor was on match point. As he walked up to serve, Thomas felt like he was inhabiting his body for the first time. He existed, not inside his head or in anyone else’s but on that hard court. And as he rallied against Grigor, there was nothing else. It was the longest rally of the match which ended with a backhand winner along the line from Grigor that Thomas could not get to.\n\n## Fresh Air\n\nThomas sat in a coffee shop the day after. Something about the game felt distant. He sat at a table under a tree. He experienced fleeting moments of quietness that coincided with the rustle of the leaves in the gentle summer afternoon breeze.\n\nThomas saw the girl across from him. She was scribbling on a notebook with a couple of pens around her. She smiled when she noticed Thomas. They struck up a conversation for the next 45 minutes. Thomas asked her about her art, where she started, how she got here. She asked him about what it was like being a professional player. They both agreed that there was no money is what they were doing unless they were in the top 100 of what they were doing.\n\nFor Thomas, she felt like someone who had made peace with herself. There was a sense of quiet assuredness about her that radiated. Her life felt like a work of art. He felt the need to make this moment last, maybe ask her phone number. His mind peaked ahead into what dating her might be like. Then he stood up, wished her good luck with her art, and then walked away.", "timestamp": 1636220127, "digest": "hGSEXCY7iphsoO2_N1dbGqhQRfCH4c9fMmRGMC42-sg", "contributor": "0x02Dad585640b1929d88296687918d7751717Ccaa"}
{"id": "cZ6MB_1Qn3csRqPf0_I7QmxqjyKpwZHjJjk-b_wBq0Y", "title": "Delimerence", "body": "## The Pill\n\n**DeLimerence XR**\n*Take One Capsule By Mouth Daily*\n\n— read the green pill bottle that Thomas was holding. This was going to change everything for him. He tried to temper his excitement by telling himself that he still had to be deliberate about his actions once he took what was inside the plastic cylinder he held. “This is not a magic bean,” he kept repeating to himself.  His first few failed attempts to pry open the bottle dampened the peak of his narrative arc a bit. After soldiering on and cursing himself, he finally held the red translucent capsule in his hand. He stared at it for a few seconds\n\n“Was this still a good idea?”\n\n“Would I get addicted to it and be unable to fall in love later in life when I want to?”\n\n“Would it somehow affect my ability to play tennis?”\n\nHe remembered something vague that he had read about how the drug affects heart rate.\n\nThe answers to his questions were on the medical information sheet that lay on the table. He did not bother to check it. He knew all that he needed to know about DeLimerence before he went to the psychiatrist.\n\nDeLimerence would stop him from feeling frantic, anxious, and out of control whenever he really liked a girl. This had held him back his whole adult life. He would like someone he met on a dating app or at a party, or for a brief moment at a coffee shop.\n\n“It could practically happen anywhere anytime,” he remembered telling the psychiatrist.\n\n“I would really unreasonably like this person and then completely lose my mind over them,” Thomas had explained when the psychiatrist had asked, “why are you here?”\n\n“I would then be unable to concentrate on my game during the matches, text her too much, become a real nervous wreck with extreme mood swings. It affected everything I did, and nothing good came out of it,” Thomas explained as he looked out the window of the psychiatrist’s office, envious of the trees that swayed gently in the wind, seemingly enjoying a better life than him.\n\nIn the middle of his explainer, Thomas noticed that he was having a hard time even making eye contact with the psychiatrist. He tried to turn his head towards the person in front of him, but his eyes landed squarely at the bottom of a bookshelf, fixating on a kitschy photo frame that read, “You are loved and important.”\n\nHe knew that the psychiatrist was just a pawn to make quick work of in the medical-industrial complex. He was going to ask him all the questions off DSM-IV, check off boxes, give him the pill.\n\n“Did you hear about any drugs for this elsewhere? Did someone recommend this to you?” the psychiatrist had asked as Thomas finished his sentence.\n\n“No,” he responded without a moment’s delay.\n\nOn the back of his mind was the subreddit r/unalovebomber that had put him onto the diagnosis he was seeking. It had been yet another torrid week. Thomas had gone on a single date with someone he met on Hinge. He had kept his cool before the date even though the long texts had built anticipation. He kept repeating his usual mantras in the shower just before the date “keep it cool, enjoy yourself, even if nothing happens, you get to enjoy someone’s company.” And then the date had gone extraordinarily well. They were both athletes - Thomas, a tennis player, ranked #400 in the world, Maddie a triathlete who worked as a nurse. They spent 6 hours talking about life, books, music, childhood stories. A day passed, Thomas held onto his nerve and did not double text, and then he got the text\n\n> You’re a great guy but I don’t think it’s a match. Hope you have a great career and make it to the top 250\n\nHe knew the drill. He had done this before and felt helpless about the fact that his baseline instincts were going to take over. Resent her, console himself by saying, “it’s her fucking loss”, watch porn and then after 4 hours when all coping mechanisms failed, weep and scream into the couch in his living room. The downstairs neighbors had filed a noise complaint the first time he cried when he moved into his new apartment, and the couch was a good acoustic cushion. After about 6 hours of this he had found new (or perhaps old) resolve to fix this once and for all and was on r/unalovebomber subreddit looking for inspiration, solutions or whatever hooked his mind. He found a post by r/epicureanjoel that he knew was going to change things and there was some sense of finality to it :\n\n> * I’ve been on DeLimerence XR for 100 days and it has completely transformed my life\\*\n> * I’ve been a 7/10 all my life, rarely had problems finding dates regularly but only met people I liked once in a while. And then when I met someone I liked, I would become a complete schizoid and show classic symptoms of a love bomber - sending too many messages, not taking any kind of negative reaction from her well, my mind would be completely out of place. Even got to the point where I almost lost a job because of this habit. Finally got diagnosed for affection processing disorder and got prescribed DeLimerance XR 10mg. I’ve been on 4 dates since starting medication, and it has gone great. I have a good time with them, don’t get anxious about text replies and you know what? 3 of those 4 dates have gone well, I’m still seeing them. Something about me being more cool and aloof about it definitely makes me more attractive to them and to myself. Don’t fall for the temporary displacement of ego that instant attraction or “love at first sight” offers. Get diagnosed and work on yourself.\\*\n\nIt all came down to this moment now. Thomas had read that it takes anywhere between 30 minutes to one hour for DeLimerence XR to take effect. The most common dosage instruction on r/unalovebomber was to take it when you were actively dating. It was Friday, and Thomas had a few matches on his dating app that he had not initiated conversations with. He was also planning to go to a house concert with a friend, Vijayan, in the evening. ‘Friend’ was too generous a definition for their relationship. Men who are in their 30s don’t have friends. Their lives are like airports, people come and go, stay awhile, make conversation, but eventually, they leave like they originally intended to.\n\nThomas felt an easiness about texting the girls on the app. Not excited, not nervous and on edge. Not craving approval like he always used to. He even flirted when they replied back. He had a picture of him wearing a t-shirt based on the PT Anderson movie There Will Be Blood, and someone he matched with commented.\n\n“Nice t-shirt btw. I love that movie.”\n\nAnd Thomas, to his own surprise, had replied “Haha who knows may be you’ll get to wear it someday”.\n\n2 hours in, he tried to cast doubt over the effect of the medicine, maybe he had just convinced himself that the pill works, and nothing substantial had actually changed in his brain chemistry. But he also did not want to find out. He liked the way it felt and planned to continue to do so. He tried to remember the names of the girls on the dating app he had ended up making plans with and could not remember. “Doesn’t matter. I have plans with them and it’s just a first date anyway,” he told himself. It was time to find out whether this drug helped with social anxiety when talking with women.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Club\n\nThomas was meeting Vijayan at the club where the House concert was happening. Vijayan was a gay Indian American that his first generation immigrant parents were proud of. He had gone through  all the layers of professional success that Asian immigrant parents could think of - graduating from Carnegie Mellon, a Harvard MBA with consulting experience in the big three, stock in a Silicon Valley company that went public a year ago. He had defeated all of his parents’ expectations. So complete was his victory that when Vijayan went home to visit them, they let him sleep in the master bedroom while they slept in the guest room. But despite all this, he struggled with relationships, often ending up in ones were he was physically abused. Thomas understood that they hung out despite being part of different social classes because of this love sickness that they shared. It came with perks such as free tickets to a Tiesto concert or regular refills of Ketamine, the good kind.\n\nAs the Uber pulled up to the club, Thomas reminded himself not to talk about taking DeLimerence. He kept telling himself that this was an intimate detail that no one needed to know about him. Yet, on some level he was also ashamed that he needed a drug to feel the way normal humans probably felt and operated.\n\n“Thomas, you look different today. Did you shave?” Vijayan asked as he caught Thomas just as he was scanning his ticket.\n\nThomas chuckled nervously. Had he been found out already, “Hey man, I guess so? Your shirt looks great btw”. A compliment was always an excellent way to deflect attention from oneself.\n\nAs they walked into the club, Thomas thought about how he would not choose this experience if he was single. It was too loud, there too many people, and everyone was trying hard to signal how hot they were and how they were different from their peers by 15% but not more. He was certain this was a feeling shared by others in the club as well, just that it was masked by whatever drug they were on or the affection they felt from the person standing next to them, sometimes a friend, sometimes a partner. He scanned around to see who he could talk to while Vijayan hovered around making conversation. He could sense that Vijayan was becoming more inebriated with each sentence that rolled out of his tongue, and within an hour or so he would just be an animated object that sometimes spoke gibberish for Thomas’s amusement.\n\nThere was a tall blonde girl wearing a short white dress drinking at the bar, away from everyone else. He considered her for a moment and his brain made the calculation within 5 seconds that she was perhaps too ambitious a target for understanding the effects of DeLimerence.\n\nHe instead squared in on the girl wearing a black crop and black high waist jeans, with long curly black hair. She was in a corner, holding a beer, she looked like an amused rabbit to Thomas. As he sipped his drink while standing next to her, Thomas examined his emotional state for a moment. His heart was quiet, he didn’t feel like his mind was racing, there were no indicators of fear. He felt euphoric and on a mission. He turned to her a couple of times, waiting for a moment where they made eye contact, and when it happened on the third try, he said “nice necklace, quite classic.”\n\n“Aw thanks. Well, funny story, I found it in an abandoned car near my house,” she replied, smiling. He could feel that her brain was quickly registering him and his body language.\n\nPerfect. Thomas thought to himself. She had responded with something to latch onto, and the conversation could now go places. As their conversation continued, Thomas would drift away in his head for moments in between to examine how he felt about    Remy, the woman he was talking to. He thought he was holding her at a distance and like he knew where the conversation was going to go next and where to take it. This was a new and interesting sensation for Thomas, who usually found himself blank when he was smitten by someone - it was not that he did not have anything to ask or say. In fact, it was that his mind was traveling at 100 mph, trying to narrow down on a single thing from the myriad of thoughts that flew by.\n\n“So is this what you do on Fridays? Smooth talk women in dim-lit clubs?” Remy asked.\n\nThomas smirked, put his hand to his chest and replied, “Aww I’m heartbroken that you think that of me while here I am thinking I don’t run into interesting people like you”, and ran his palm on the inside of her elbow. What he said would have been true a week before, but not today. Today it felt like a lie, and he felt okay with it. This what be must courtship means to people now, he thought as he felt Remy standing closer to him.\n\nThere comes a moment in time while at a club where the effect of drugs and the music crescendo and everyone feels like they share a fleeting communal moment. After that peak, things tend to go downhill. As this moment approached, Thomas was further sure that he was going home with Remy tonight. He looked around for Vijayan and saw him standing against the bar, drink in his hand, his eyes looking like they were searching for something, perhaps trying to find the last ounce of energy in him to co-ordinate the movement of his body. Thomas, for the first time since they started hanging out, felt terrible for Vijayan. He even detested him a bit. “I guess hanging out with people like this is why I never had any luck with women,” he thought to himself.\n\n“Bunch of fucking beta cucks,” he thought as he planted his lips on Remy’s while gripping her close.\n\nWhen they had sex at Remy’s place, Thomas did not feel like he was falling in love or incredibly attracted to her. The sex was fine. Thomas never took deep pleasure from it except for the one time he was in a two-year relationship. It felt mechanical, but he felt powerful if it elicited reactions from the woman he was with, so that is what he focussed on. He was glad that he did not feel like staying for long after like he usually did, lingering on in the aftermath, hoping there is something deeper there. He felt cured.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Court\n\nThomas was playing the best tennis of his life.\n\nHe was in the quarterfinal of an ATP 500 tournament for the first time in his life.\n\nEvery time he got knocked out of the tournament, his coach said, “You need to be ruthless. You need a bit more of that fuck you attitude that the best players have”. He felt that in his approach on court in this tournament, he would not let it up now. He had won the last game 6-0, 6-1 and let out a guttural war cry at the end of the game. The crowd booed, but Thomas felt invigorated by being the hated one for once, not the nice guy. “Like the best in the business”, he thought to himself.\n\nToday he was up against world number 105 Felix Oviedo. As he warmed up for the game, he thought about the last three weeks since he started DeLimerence XR. He had been with three women, all three of whom he left on read. He liked to think the control he felt reflected elsewhere, including his game. He was not wrong. DeLimerence had made him more ruthless, calculated in unexplainable ways. “You never know how its going to affect you until you take. Different people have different results” read a user’s post on r/UnaLovebomber\n\nAs he warmed up for the game, he saw Felix walk into the court. He was accompanied by his coach and a woman who looked like his girlfriend. She was above average height for a woman, wearing a flowing dark blue dress that stopped above her knee, a white hat, and round green sunglasses. She stood by Felix as he talked with his coach, running her palm over his shoulders, brushing something off his face. They exchanged glances often, sometimes pecking each other on the lips. Thomas was distracted and annoyed by this. He felt something inside him sink, a feeling that he had not experienced since he started DeLimerence. He took a few deep breaths and tried to remember if he had taken DeLimerence today. He clearly remembered the green bottle in his hand about an hour ago. He felt this moment would pass, so he resumed his training, trying to focus on finding the middle of the racket with every hit. Fourth shot of a new rally with his went flying into the stands. Mishits happen. He reset himself with a few more bounces of the ball and glances at his watch. The next three returns sprayed across the court - two of them going too far and one hitting the net.\n\n“Calm down Thoma” his French coach urged from the other side.\n\nAs he walked out the court, yielding the rest of the time to Felix for his warm-up, he glanced at the couple who were sharing an embrace, and Thomas felt defeated.\n\nHe sat in the dressing room 20 minutes before the game, wondering what had hit him. His mind was racing again and seemed like it was searching for reasons to explain this. When he remembered that he had no one with him except for the coach he was paying to be there, he felt a sense of inevitability. The return of the same memories, like a fly stuck to honey. Thomas was not going to give up now. This was his moment, and he had to make it last. His body had been under stress throughout the tournament, and it needed more replenishment than it usually did. Perhaps it applied to DeLimerence too. The current dosage did not have the desired effect.  There was no great conflict in coming to this decision, so he took another 10mg pill of DeLimerence XR 10 minutes before he went on court.\n\nThe game with Felix was harder than his last.  The first set went to Felix. The second went to the tie break. Thomas was on set point. He reset his mind by remembering Tchivosky overture 1812. The music peaked in Thomas’s head as he brought the ball to the racket and raised his hands to serve for the set. He heard a “Cmon Felix” from behind him when he released the ball but Thomas felt an easiness come over his body, and his racket swung down on the ball, and he knew he had hit an ace the moment the ball hit the sweet spot. Felix did not move. Thomas did not feel the need to. Instead, he turned around to where the words of encouragement had come from. It was the girlfriend. He pumped his fist and then drummed it against his chest while looking directly at her. The match was won in that moment. The next set finished 6-2 in Thomas’s favor. He had made it to the semifinal of an ATP 500 tournament.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Hotel\n\nIt had been 6 hours since he took the second 10mg pill. He was going to feel the effect of the drug well into the night. Thomas was about to head out to get dinner. He expanded his chest as he looked at himself in the mirror. He stared into his reflection and could not recognize the fierceness in the eyes of the person that stared back at him. He usually rested after games, nursing wounds, doing plyometric exercises to get in shape for the next game, which was tomorrow. But today, he wanted to go out. He needed to be with a woman and wanted the world to know he could have anyone he wants at this moment.\n\nGoing alone to dinner was something he rarely did, and never at a restaurant with $$$ on Google maps. As the waitress guided him to a table, he noticed no one at the bar counter seats except for a woman wearing a white summer dress with a low back cut. He asked the waitress if he could be seated at the bar instead and moved in that direction before the waitress could respond. He glanced in the direction of the woman as he sat two seats away from her and smiled at her when she looked to see who had decided to dare to disturb her solitude.\n\nThe bar tables overlooked the ocean through floor-to-ceiling glass windows. The restaurant was on the 3rd floor, and at Thomas’s eye line, it seemed as if the restaurant was floating on the ocean. The last tinge of yellow of the sun refracted through the bottles of alcohol lined up a 30-foot shelf.\n\nThe waitress had taken his order, and the bartender had turned away after taking an order for an old fashioned from the woman in white. Thomas saw the opportunity for an opening.\n\n“So you’re a fellow whiskey lover?” He asked.\n\nShe turned to Thomas, smiled assuredly and replied, “Is that the best opening line that you’ve got?”.\n\nThomas was not fluttered the least by it. He had got good or at least felt good about dealing with volleys such as this one.\n\n“Would you rather talk about how beautiful the weather is, or should I remark on the beauty of the ocean?” He replied without taking his eye off hers.\n\nShe looked away before he did, into the glass in front of her “sorry, I didn’t mean to be rude, I’m Sarah, and yes, I do love a good whiskey,” she said as she raised the glass towards him.\n\n“I’m Thomas. I love a good whiskey too, especially today,” Thomas replied, leaving it open for a question.\n\n“What happened today?”\n\n“Just won a game of tennis,” Thomas said, with understatement in his voice.\n\n“Are you a tennis player?”\n\n“Yes,” replied Thomas as he noticed that Sarah had shifted her body towards him and was looking at his face intently, searching for something. Thomas mistook this for interest so he continued, “Playing someone ranked 51st in the world tomorrow actually.”\n\nSarah interrupted the conversation.\n\n“Sorry. Are you on DeLimerence?” She asked.\n\nThomas gulped and flashbacked to the experience he had had before he starting taking Delimerence - one of his mind traveling at an enormous speed trying to find a response that would make him feel less judged. But nothing bubbled up to the top of his mind to fill the void in the nick of time.\n\n“How did you know” he finally replied, almost defeated but not showing it on his face.\n\n“You have that look in your eyes,” Sarah replied, feeling slightly guilty that she had brought it up.\n\nThomas was staring at his drink and then into the ocean.\n\n“It’s alright, I’m on it too,” she replied, hoping it would soften the blow.\n\nThis piqued his head. “You’re on DeLimerence? Have you been with someone on DeLimerence before?” Thomas asked.\n\n“No, why would I want to be with someone who’s just like me?” She replied and then chuckled as she ended that sentence.\n\nThomas wondered why the effect of DeLimerence was not working at this moment. Was it a placebo all this while? He felt like he needed to impress this woman so that she would go home with him and at the same time resented her.\n\n“What is this look in my eyes that you noticed?” Thomas asked as he composed himself and looked Sarah in the eyes. The sounds of the bar, the conversations, clinking glasses came into sharp focus as he asked this.\n\n“The look of deep amusement with yourself and how you are.”\n\n“Like you’d fall in love with your reflection any moment now.”\n\nThomas crumbled. He wanted to yell at her, maybe even hit her. He looks at his palms that were face down on the table. They were trembling, with anxiety or anger. Thomas was not sure.\n\nHe continued eating and finishing his drink while he and Sarah both sat in the quietness of the bar counter. When it turned dark, the ocean was not visible anymore. It seemed that nothing existed outside of the window. Just an unassuming void.\n\nSarah got up to leave first and glanced at Thomas, who never lifted his head up. She walked out. Thomas could hear the sound of her heels moving further away. He felt relieved for a moment. And then he started ruminating on the game tomorrow.\n\n“What if DeLimerence does not work anymore? It does not seem to have any effect in this moment,” he thought to himself.\n\nHe felt a cold wave build up in his head like his nerves were tingling against his skull, and this sensation washed across his spine, and he felt his eyes well up, like he had no control over it. Finally, he brought himself back to the moment and collected himself enough to pay the check.\n\nA cool evening breeze hit his face as he walked out of the restaurant. For a couple of seconds, after he forgot where he had been and what had just transpired, a sense of peace crept in, only to be violently jolted out of it by an intrusive thought, “Wish I could share this with someone.” His mind and body were pulling him in opposite directions, one racing ahead and the other crashing down. Thomas held his nerve till he got to his hotel room, and then as soon as the door was closed behind him, he collapsed on the ground face first. He felt his chest heaving and a scream building up in his throat, and he let it out. He felt tears rushing down his cheeks.\n\nAt this moment, his inner voice reverted to what it had been taught as a child. “Why don’t you go fucking kill yourself” it demanded, and Thomas wailed harder to drown out the voice. Until his body was tired and could not generate any more thoughts.\n\nThere is a sense of clarity that fills the space that fills the space of sadness once it has left the body. The first lucid thought told Thomas that he would probably kill himself if he goes through a similar evening again. He had read about DeLimerence crashes on r/UnaLoveBomber.\n\nThomas had given up. DeLimerence was not going to save him. The game with world number 51 was lost before it had begun.\n\n## Let it go\n\nThomas looked around and saw people trickle into the stadium. This would be the biggest crowd he had played in front of, and it did not mean anything to him. He could feel the texture of the handle of the racket in his hand, his breath against his nostrils, foot firm yet nimble and ready to move. As he hit back ball after ball that his coach served him, he felt he had more time than ever before. Every ball seemed to be hitting the racket’s sweet spot, yet it was not bringing him the dopamine hits it usually did.  It just was.\n\nWhen the match began, the crowd was on the side of tournament favorite and world number 51 Grigor Milov. Thomas could hear chants of “Grigor, Grigor” as he lined up to serve, he closed his eyes for a moment and the chants transformed “Thomas, Thomas” in his head, and it crescendoed as he barreled down some of the fastest serves of his life. Bu the first set still went the way of the experienced Grigor 7-5.\n\nGrigor expected the fight to be over after a decisive first set but unknown to him Thomas was neither deflated nor trying to motivate himself for the next set. The intensity did not abate in this second set and this caught Grigor off guard - he lost 6-4.\n\nThe crowd had turned against him now. They were behind this kid, ranked who knows what, playing his first ATP 500 semifinal taking it to the tournament favorite.\n\nThe third set went to a tie break. Grigor was on match point. As he walked up to serve, Thomas felt like he was inhabiting his body for the first time. He existed, not inside his head or in anyone else’s but on that hard court. And as he rallied against Grigor, there was nothing else. It was the longest rally of the match which ended with a backhand winner along the line from Grigor that Thomas could not get to.\n\n## Fresh Air\n\nThomas sat in a coffee shop the day after. Something about the game felt distant. He sat at a table under a tree. He experienced fleeting moments of quietness that coincided with the rustle of the leaves in the gentle summer afternoon breeze.\n\nThomas saw the girl across from him. She was scribbling on a notebook with a couple of pens around her. She smiled when she noticed Thomas. They struck up a conversation for the next 45 minutes. Thomas asked her about her art, where she started, how she got here. She asked him about what it was like being a professional player. They both agreed that there was no money is what they were doing unless they were in the top 100 of what they were doing.\n\nFor Thomas, she felt like someone who had made peace with herself. There was a sense of quiet assuredness about her that radiated. Her life felt like a work of art. He felt the need to make this moment last, maybe ask her phone number. His mind peaked ahead into what dating her might be like. Then he stood up, wished her good luck with her art, and then walked away.", "timestamp": 1636220419, "digest": "hGSEXCY7iphsoO2_N1dbGqhQRfCH4c9fMmRGMC42-sg", "contributor": "0x02Dad585640b1929d88296687918d7751717Ccaa"}
{"id": "eW448adv0VHH10dtEiWdfHaTVOX9uX9kRRi26c7hzG8", "title": "Delimerence", "body": "## The Pill\n\n**DeLimerence XR**\n*Take One Capsule By Mouth Daily*\n\n— read the green pill bottle that Thomas was holding. This was going to change everything for him. He tried to temper his excitement by telling himself that he still had to be deliberate about his actions once he took what was inside the plastic cylinder he held. “This is not a magic bean,” he kept repeating to himself.  His first few failed attempts to pry open the bottle dampened the peak of his narrative arc a bit. After soldiering on and cursing himself, he finally held the red translucent capsule in his hand. He stared at it for a few seconds\n\n“Was this still a good idea?”\n\n“Would I get addicted to it and be unable to fall in love later in life when I want to?”\n\n“Would it somehow affect my ability to play tennis?”\n\nHe remembered something vague that he had read about how the drug affects heart rate.\n\nThe answers to his questions were on the medical information sheet that lay on the table. He did not bother to check it. He knew all that he needed to know about DeLimerence before he went to the psychiatrist.\n\nDeLimerence would stop him from feeling frantic, anxious, and out of control whenever he really liked a girl. This had held him back his whole adult life. He would like someone he met on a dating app or at a party, or for a brief moment at a coffee shop.\n\n“It could practically happen anywhere anytime,” he remembered telling the psychiatrist.\n\n“I would really unreasonably like this person and then completely lose my mind over them,” Thomas had explained when the psychiatrist had asked, “why are you here?”\n\n“I would then be unable to concentrate on my game during the matches, text her too much, become a real nervous wreck with extreme mood swings. It affected everything I did, and nothing good came out of it,” Thomas explained as he looked out the window of the psychiatrist’s office, envious of the trees that swayed gently in the wind, seemingly enjoying a better life than him.\n\nIn the middle of his explainer, Thomas noticed that he was having a hard time even making eye contact with the psychiatrist. He tried to turn his head towards the person in front of him, but his eyes landed squarely at the bottom of a bookshelf, fixating on a kitschy photo frame that read, “You are loved and important.”\n\nHe knew that the psychiatrist was just a pawn to make quick work of in the medical-industrial complex. He was going to ask him all the questions off DSM-IV, check off boxes, give him the pill.\n\n“Did you hear about any drugs for this elsewhere? Did someone recommend this to you?” the psychiatrist had asked as Thomas finished his sentence.\n\n“No,” he responded without a moment’s delay.\n\nOn the back of his mind was the subreddit r/unalovebomber that had put him onto the diagnosis he was seeking. It had been yet another torrid week. Thomas had gone on a single date with someone he met on Hinge. He had kept his cool before the date even though the long texts had built anticipation. He kept repeating his usual mantras in the shower just before the date “keep it cool, enjoy yourself, even if nothing happens, you get to enjoy someone’s company.” And then the date had gone extraordinarily well. They were both athletes - Thomas, a tennis player, ranked #400 in the world, Maddie a triathlete who worked as a nurse. They spent 6 hours talking about life, books, music, childhood stories. A day passed, Thomas held onto his nerve and did not double text, and then he got the text\n\n> You’re a great guy but I don’t think it’s a match. Hope you have a great career and make it to the top 250\n\nHe knew the drill. He had done this before and felt helpless about the fact that his baseline instincts were going to take over. Resent her, console himself by saying, “it’s her fucking loss”, watch porn and then after 4 hours when all coping mechanisms failed, weep and scream into the couch in his living room. The downstairs neighbors had filed a noise complaint the first time he cried when he moved into his new apartment, and the couch was a good acoustic cushion. After about 6 hours of this he had found new (or perhaps old) resolve to fix this once and for all and was on r/unalovebomber subreddit looking for inspiration, solutions or whatever hooked his mind. He found a post by r/epicureanjoel that he knew was going to change things and there was some sense of finality to it :\n\n> * I’ve been on DeLimerence XR for 100 days and it has completely transformed my life\\*\n> * I’ve been a 7/10 all my life, rarely had problems finding dates regularly but only met people I liked once in a while. And then when I met someone I liked, I would become a complete schizoid and show classic symptoms of a love bomber - sending too many messages, not taking any kind of negative reaction from her well, my mind would be completely out of place. Even got to the point where I almost lost a job because of this habit. Finally got diagnosed for affection processing disorder and got prescribed DeLimerance XR 10mg. I’ve been on 4 dates since starting medication, and it has gone great. I have a good time with them, don’t get anxious about text replies and you know what? 3 of those 4 dates have gone well, I’m still seeing them. Something about me being more cool and aloof about it definitely makes me more attractive to them and to myself. Don’t fall for the temporary displacement of ego that instant attraction or “love at first sight” offers. Get diagnosed and work on yourself.\\*\n\nIt all came down to this moment now. Thomas had read that it takes anywhere between 30 minutes to one hour for DeLimerence XR to take effect. The most common dosage instruction on r/unalovebomber was to take it when you were actively dating. It was Friday, and Thomas had a few matches on his dating app that he had not initiated conversations with. He was also planning to go to a house concert with a friend, Vijayan, in the evening. ‘Friend’ was too generous a definition for their relationship. Men who are in their 30s don’t have friends. Their lives are like airports, people come and go, stay awhile, make conversation, but eventually, they leave like they originally intended to.\n\nThomas felt an easiness about texting the girls on the app. Not excited, not nervous and on edge. Not craving approval like he always used to. He even flirted when they replied back. He had a picture of him wearing a t-shirt based on the PT Anderson movie There Will Be Blood, and someone he matched with commented.\n\n“Nice t-shirt btw. I love that movie.”\n\nAnd Thomas, to his own surprise, had replied “Haha who knows may be you’ll get to wear it someday”.\n\n2 hours in, he tried to cast doubt over the effect of the medicine, maybe he had just convinced himself that the pill works, and nothing substantial had actually changed in his brain chemistry. But he also did not want to find out. He liked the way it felt and planned to continue to do so. He tried to remember the names of the girls on the dating app he had ended up making plans with and could not remember. “Doesn’t matter. I have plans with them and it’s just a first date anyway,” he told himself. It was time to find out whether this drug helped with social anxiety when talking with women.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Club\n\nThomas was meeting Vijayan at the club where the House concert was happening. Vijayan was a gay Indian American that his first generation immigrant parents were proud of. He had gone through  all the layers of professional success that Asian immigrant parents could think of - graduating from Carnegie Mellon, a Harvard MBA with consulting experience in the big three, stock in a Silicon Valley company that went public a year ago. He had defeated all of his parents’ expectations. So complete was his victory that when Vijayan went home to visit them, they let him sleep in the master bedroom while they slept in the guest room. But despite all this, he struggled with relationships, often ending up in ones were he was physically abused. Thomas understood that they hung out despite being part of different social classes because of this love sickness that they shared. It came with perks such as free tickets to a Tiesto concert or regular refills of Ketamine, the good kind.\n\nAs the Uber pulled up to the club, Thomas reminded himself not to talk about taking DeLimerence. He kept telling himself that this was an intimate detail that no one needed to know about him. Yet, on some level he was also ashamed that he needed a drug to feel the way normal humans probably felt and operated.\n\n“Thomas, you look different today. Did you shave?” Vijayan asked as he caught Thomas just as he was scanning his ticket.\n\nThomas chuckled nervously. Had he been found out already, “Hey man, I guess so? Your shirt looks great btw”. A compliment was always an excellent way to deflect attention from oneself.\n\nAs they walked into the club, Thomas thought about how he would not choose this experience if he was single. It was too loud, there too many people, and everyone was trying hard to signal how hot they were and how they were different from their peers by 15% but not more. He was certain this was a feeling shared by others in the club as well, just that it was masked by whatever drug they were on or the affection they felt from the person standing next to them, sometimes a friend, sometimes a partner. He scanned around to see who he could talk to while Vijayan hovered around making conversation. He could sense that Vijayan was becoming more inebriated with each sentence that rolled out of his tongue, and within an hour or so he would just be an animated object that sometimes spoke gibberish for Thomas’s amusement.\n\nThere was a tall blonde girl wearing a short white dress drinking at the bar, away from everyone else. He considered her for a moment and his brain made the calculation within 5 seconds that she was perhaps too ambitious a target for understanding the effects of DeLimerence.\n\nHe instead squared in on the girl wearing a black crop and black high waist jeans, with long curly black hair. She was in a corner, holding a beer, she looked like an amused rabbit to Thomas. As he sipped his drink while standing next to her, Thomas examined his emotional state for a moment. His heart was quiet, he didn’t feel like his mind was racing, there were no indicators of fear. He felt euphoric and on a mission. He turned to her a couple of times, waiting for a moment where they made eye contact, and when it happened on the third try, he said “nice necklace, quite classic.”\n\n“Aw thanks. Well, funny story, I found it in an abandoned car near my house,” she replied, smiling. He could feel that her brain was quickly registering him and his body language.\n\nPerfect. Thomas thought to himself. She had responded with something to latch onto, and the conversation could now go places. As their conversation continued, Thomas would drift away in his head for moments in between to examine how he felt about    Remy, the woman he was talking to. He thought he was holding her at a distance and like he knew where the conversation was going to go next and where to take it. This was a new and interesting sensation for Thomas, who usually found himself blank when he was smitten by someone - it was not that he did not have anything to ask or say. In fact, it was that his mind was traveling at 100 mph, trying to narrow down on a single thing from the myriad of thoughts that flew by.\n\n“So is this what you do on Fridays? Smooth talk women in dim-lit clubs?” Remy asked.\n\nThomas smirked, put his hand to his chest and replied, “Aww I’m heartbroken that you think that of me while here I am thinking I don’t run into interesting people like you”, and ran his palm on the inside of her elbow. What he said would have been true a week before, but not today. Today it felt like a lie, and he felt okay with it. This what be must courtship means to people now, he thought as he felt Remy standing closer to him.\n\nThere comes a moment in time while at a club where the effect of drugs and the music crescendo and everyone feels like they share a fleeting communal moment. After that peak, things tend to go downhill. As this moment approached, Thomas was further sure that he was going home with Remy tonight. He looked around for Vijayan and saw him standing against the bar, drink in his hand, his eyes looking like they were searching for something, perhaps trying to find the last ounce of energy in him to co-ordinate the movement of his body. Thomas, for the first time since they started hanging out, felt terrible for Vijayan. He even detested him a bit. “I guess hanging out with people like this is why I never had any luck with women,” he thought to himself.\n\n“Bunch of fucking beta cucks,” he thought as he planted his lips on Remy’s while gripping her close.\n\nWhen they had sex at Remy’s place, Thomas did not feel like he was falling in love or incredibly attracted to her. The sex was fine. Thomas never took deep pleasure from it except for the one time he was in a two-year relationship. It felt mechanical, but he felt powerful if it elicited reactions from the woman he was with, so that is what he focussed on. He was glad that he did not feel like staying for long after like he usually did, lingering on in the aftermath, hoping there is something deeper there. He felt cured.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Court\n\nThomas was playing the best tennis of his life.\n\nHe was in the quarterfinal of an ATP 500 tournament for the first time in his life.\n\nEvery time he got knocked out of the tournament, his coach said, “You need to be ruthless. You need a bit more of that fuck you attitude that the best players have”. He felt that in his approach on court in this tournament, he would not let it up now. He had won the last game 6-0, 6-1 and let out a guttural war cry at the end of the game. The crowd booed, but Thomas felt invigorated by being the hated one for once, not the nice guy. “Like the best in the business”, he thought to himself.\n\nToday he was up against world number 105 Felix Oviedo. As he warmed up for the game, he thought about the last three weeks since he started DeLimerence XR. He had been with three women, all three of whom he left on read. He liked to think the control he felt reflected elsewhere, including his game. He was not wrong. DeLimerence had made him more ruthless, calculated in unexplainable ways. “You never know how its going to affect you until you take. Different people have different results” read a user’s post on r/UnaLovebomber\n\nAs he warmed up for the game, he saw Felix walk into the court. He was accompanied by his coach and a woman who looked like his girlfriend. She was above average height for a woman, wearing a flowing dark blue dress that stopped above her knee, a white hat, and round green sunglasses. She stood by Felix as he talked with his coach, running her palm over his shoulders, brushing something off his face. They exchanged glances often, sometimes pecking each other on the lips. Thomas was distracted and annoyed by this. He felt something inside him sink, a feeling that he had not experienced since he started DeLimerence. He took a few deep breaths and tried to remember if he had taken DeLimerence today. He clearly remembered the green bottle in his hand about an hour ago. He felt this moment would pass, so he resumed his training, trying to focus on finding the middle of the racket with every hit. Fourth shot of a new rally with his went flying into the stands. Mishits happen. He reset himself with a few more bounces of the ball and glances at his watch. The next three returns sprayed across the court - two of them going too far and one hitting the net.\n\n“Calm down Thoma” his French coach urged from the other side.\n\nAs he walked out the court, yielding the rest of the time to Felix for his warm-up, he glanced at the couple who were sharing an embrace, and Thomas felt defeated.\n\nHe sat in the dressing room 20 minutes before the game, wondering what had hit him. His mind was racing again and seemed like it was searching for reasons to explain this. When he remembered that he had no one with him except for the coach he was paying to be there, he felt a sense of inevitability. The return of the same memories, like a fly stuck to honey. Thomas was not going to give up now. This was his moment, and he had to make it last. His body had been under stress throughout the tournament, and it needed more replenishment than it usually did. Perhaps it applied to DeLimerence too. The current dosage did not have the desired effect.  There was no great conflict in coming to this decision, so he took another 10mg pill of DeLimerence XR 10 minutes before he went on court.\n\nThe game with Felix was harder than his last.  The first set went to Felix. The second went to the tie break. Thomas was on set point. He reset his mind by remembering Tchivosky overture 1812. The music peaked in Thomas’s head as he brought the ball to the racket and raised his hands to serve for the set. He heard a “Cmon Felix” from behind him when he released the ball but Thomas felt an easiness come over his body, and his racket swung down on the ball, and he knew he had hit an ace the moment the ball hit the sweet spot. Felix did not move. Thomas did not feel the need to. Instead, he turned around to where the words of encouragement had come from. It was the girlfriend. He pumped his fist and then drummed it against his chest while looking directly at her. The match was won in that moment. The next set finished 6-2 in Thomas’s favor. He had made it to the semifinal of an ATP 500 tournament.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Hotel\n\nIt had been 6 hours since he took the second 10mg pill. He was going to feel the effect of the drug well into the night. Thomas was about to head out to get dinner. He expanded his chest as he looked at himself in the mirror. He stared into his reflection and could not recognize the fierceness in the eyes of the person that stared back at him. He usually rested after games, nursing wounds, doing plyometric exercises to get in shape for the next game, which was tomorrow. But today, he wanted to go out. He needed to be with a woman and wanted the world to know he could have anyone he wants at this moment.\n\nGoing alone to dinner was something he rarely did, and never at a restaurant with $$$ on Google maps. As the waitress guided him to a table, he noticed no one at the bar counter seats except for a woman wearing a white summer dress with a low back cut. He asked the waitress if he could be seated at the bar instead and moved in that direction before the waitress could respond. He glanced in the direction of the woman as he sat two seats away from her and smiled at her when she looked to see who had decided to dare to disturb her solitude.\n\nThe bar tables overlooked the ocean through floor-to-ceiling glass windows. The restaurant was on the 3rd floor, and at Thomas’s eye line, it seemed as if the restaurant was floating on the ocean. The last tinge of yellow of the sun refracted through the bottles of alcohol lined up a 30-foot shelf.\n\nThe waitress had taken his order, and the bartender had turned away after taking an order for an old fashioned from the woman in white. Thomas saw the opportunity for an opening.\n\n“So you’re a fellow whiskey lover?” He asked.\n\nShe turned to Thomas, smiled assuredly and replied, “Is that the best opening line that you’ve got?”.\n\nThomas was not fluttered the least by it. He had got good or at least felt good about dealing with volleys such as this one.\n\n“Would you rather talk about how beautiful the weather is, or should I remark on the beauty of the ocean?” He replied without taking his eye off hers.\n\nShe looked away before he did, into the glass in front of her “sorry, I didn’t mean to be rude, I’m Sarah, and yes, I do love a good whiskey,” she said as she raised the glass towards him.\n\n“I’m Thomas. I love a good whiskey too, especially today,” Thomas replied, leaving it open for a question.\n\n“What happened today?”\n\n“Just won a game of tennis,” Thomas said, with understatement in his voice.\n\n“Are you a tennis player?”\n\n“Yes,” replied Thomas as he noticed that Sarah had shifted her body towards him and was looking at his face intently, searching for something. Thomas mistook this for interest so he continued, “Playing someone ranked 51st in the world tomorrow actually.”\n\nSarah interrupted the conversation.\n\n“Sorry. Are you on DeLimerence?” She asked.\n\nThomas gulped and flashbacked to the experience he had had before he starting taking Delimerence - one of his mind traveling at an enormous speed trying to find a response that would make him feel less judged. But nothing bubbled up to the top of his mind to fill the void in the nick of time.\n\n“How did you know” he finally replied, almost defeated but not showing it on his face.\n\n“You have that look in your eyes,” Sarah replied, feeling slightly guilty that she had brought it up.\n\nThomas was staring at his drink and then into the ocean.\n\n“It’s alright, I’m on it too,” she replied, hoping it would soften the blow.\n\nThis piqued his head. “You’re on DeLimerence? Have you been with someone on DeLimerence before?” Thomas asked.\n\n“No, why would I want to be with someone who’s just like me?” She replied and then chuckled as she ended that sentence.\n\nThomas wondered why the effect of DeLimerence was not working at this moment. Was it a placebo all this while? He felt like he needed to impress this woman so that she would go home with him and at the same time resented her.\n\n“What is this look in my eyes that you noticed?” Thomas asked as he composed himself and looked Sarah in the eyes. The sounds of the bar, the conversations, clinking glasses came into sharp focus as he asked this.\n\n“The look of deep amusement with yourself and how you are.”\n\n“Like you’d fall in love with your reflection any moment now.”\n\nThomas crumbled. He wanted to yell at her, maybe even hit her. He looks at his palms that were face down on the table. They were trembling, with anxiety or anger. Thomas was not sure.\n\nHe continued eating and finishing his drink while he and Sarah both sat in the quietness of the bar counter. When it turned dark, the ocean was not visible anymore. It seemed that nothing existed outside of the window. Just an unassuming void.\n\nSarah got up to leave first and glanced at Thomas, who never lifted his head up. She walked out. Thomas could hear the sound of her heels moving further away. He felt relieved for a moment. And then he started ruminating on the game tomorrow.\n\n“What if DeLimerence does not work anymore? It does not seem to have any effect in this moment,” he thought to himself.\n\nHe felt a cold wave build up in his head like his nerves were tingling against his skull, and this sensation washed across his spine, and he felt his eyes well up, like he had no control over it. Finally, he brought himself back to the moment and collected himself enough to pay the check.\n\nA cool evening breeze hit his face as he walked out of the restaurant. For a couple of seconds, after he forgot where he had been and what had just transpired, a sense of peace crept in, only to be violently jolted out of it by an intrusive thought, “Wish I could share this with someone.” His mind and body were pulling him in opposite directions, one racing ahead and the other crashing down. Thomas held his nerve till he got to his hotel room, and then as soon as the door was closed behind him, he collapsed on the ground face first. He felt his chest heaving and a scream building up in his throat, and he let it out. He felt tears rushing down his cheeks.\n\nAt this moment, his inner voice reverted to what it had been taught as a child. “Why don’t you go fucking kill yourself” it demanded, and Thomas wailed harder to drown out the voice. Until his body was tired and could not generate any more thoughts.\n\nThere is a sense of clarity that fills the space that fills the space of sadness once it has left the body. The first lucid thought told Thomas that he would probably kill himself if he goes through a similar evening again. He had read about DeLimerence crashes on r/UnaLoveBomber.\n\nThomas had given up. DeLimerence was not going to save him. The game with world number 51 was lost before it had begun.\n\n## Let it go\n\nThomas looked around and saw people trickle into the stadium. This would be the biggest crowd he had played in front of, and it did not mean anything to him. He could feel the texture of the handle of the racket in his hand, his breath against his nostrils, foot firm yet nimble and ready to move. As he hit back ball after ball that his coach served him, he felt he had more time than ever before. Every ball seemed to be hitting the racket’s sweet spot, yet it was not bringing him the dopamine hits it usually did.  It just was.\n\nWhen the match began, the crowd was on the side of tournament favorite and world number 51 Grigor Milov. Thomas could hear chants of “Grigor, Grigor” as he lined up to serve, he closed his eyes for a moment and the chants transformed “Thomas, Thomas” in his head, and it crescendoed as he barreled down some of the fastest serves of his life. Bu the first set still went the way of the experienced Grigor 7-5.\n\nGrigor expected the fight to be over after a decisive first set but unknown to him Thomas was neither deflated nor trying to motivate himself for the next set. The intensity did not abate in this second set and this caught Grigor off guard - he lost 6-4.\n\nThe crowd had turned against him now. They were behind this kid, ranked who knows what, playing his first ATP 500 semifinal taking it to the tournament favorite.\n\nThe third set went to a tie break. Grigor was on match point. As he walked up to serve, Thomas felt like he was inhabiting his body for the first time. He existed, not inside his head or in anyone else’s but on that hard court. And as he rallied against Grigor, there was nothing else. It was the longest rally of the match which ended with a backhand winner along the line from Grigor that Thomas could not get to.\n\n## Fresh Air\n\nThomas sat in a coffee shop the day after. Something about the game felt distant. He sat at a table under a tree. He experienced fleeting moments of quietness that coincided with the rustle of the leaves in the gentle summer afternoon breeze.\n\nThomas saw the girl across from him. She was scribbling on a notebook with a couple of pens around her. She smiled when she noticed Thomas. They struck up a conversation for the next 45 minutes. Thomas asked her about her art, where she started, how she got here. She asked him about what it was like being a professional player. They both agreed that there was no money is what they were doing unless they were in the top 100 of what they were doing.\n\nFor Thomas, she felt like someone who had made peace with herself. There was a sense of quiet assuredness about her that radiated. Her life felt like a work of art. He felt the need to make this moment last, maybe ask her phone number. His mind peaked ahead into what dating her might be like. Then he stood up, wished her good luck with her art, and then walked away.", "timestamp": 1636220500, "digest": "hGSEXCY7iphsoO2_N1dbGqhQRfCH4c9fMmRGMC42-sg", "contributor": "0x02Dad585640b1929d88296687918d7751717Ccaa"}

After a couple of lengthy posts, it was decided medium would be more apropos to that end. I have slightly modified it to make sense apart from the discord context. The aforementioned channel will still be available for discussion, comments, questions, & queries.*\n\nWith the combined experience in the POAPathon [discord](https://discord.gg/f9DYpspFbU) server, I thought the #tips-and-tricks could serve as a channel to trade resources, methods, tools, tips, & tricks. A sort of “*Recipe Swap*” channel. To start us off I’ll list a few of my favorites & a few insights I had while watching the NFT.NYC awards.\n\nFirst up is my favorite & the one I probably use the most.\n\nSketchbook by Autodesk\n\n[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sketchbook/id883738213](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sketchbook/id883738213)\n\nI have used this on all my iOS devices for several years. It’s astonishing that it’s free. I’ve done some really creative stuff with just this & an iPhone. Tools are fairly simple to figure out & pretty intuitive. Tip: Play around with layers & the transparency slider of each. You can create really cool effects. No ads, just free.\n\nNext are a couple of Open-Source image editors with a familiar feel. If Photoshop is The “God of Thunder” these two are the other Hemsworth brothers. I prefer Paint.net as it is a little simpler UI than GIMP but that’s just a matter of personal taste. They are both great analogs to the OG adobe product.\n\nhttps://www.getpaint.net/\n\n[https://www.gimp.org/](https://www.gimp.org/)\n\nNext up is Canva. I’ve only recently started using this but I’m finding it indispensable, for text effects especially.\n\n[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/canva-design-photo-video/id897446215](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/canva-design-photo-video/id897446215)\n\nNow a few things I gleaned from the NFT.NYC award presentation. First of all, the way the slides were done was perfect. Seeing all the submissions followed by the winner made it really fun to watch. If you haven’t seen it I encourage you to watch <https://youtu.be/8f2pb31GPuQ> There were a couple of things I noticed that gave people an edge in quality. First, Borders. Borders. Borders. Even just a thin, slightly inset border can make a huge difference. The other big one is Contrast. A look at my PFP should make it obvious I’m a sucker for high contrast. There were quite a few entries that were amazing uses of this. It doesn’t have to be as stark as black & yellow. In some cases darkening or lightening contrast or using complementary colors can make a world of difference.

After a couple of lengthy posts, it was decided medium would be more apropos to that end. I have slightly modified it to make sense apart from the discord context. The aforementioned channel will still be available for discussion, comments, questions, & queries.*\n\nWith the combined experience in the POAPathon [discord](https://discord.gg/f9DYpspFbU) server, I thought the #tips-and-tricks could serve as a channel to trade resources, methods, tools, tips, & tricks. A sort of “*Recipe Swap*” channel. To start us off I’ll list a few of my favorites & a few insights I had while watching the NFT.NYC awards.\n\nFirst up is my favorite & the one I probably use the most.\n\nSketchbook by Autodesk\n\n[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sketchbook/id883738213](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sketchbook/id883738213)\n\nI have used this on all my iOS devices for several years. It’s astonishing that it’s free. I’ve done some really creative stuff with just this & an iPhone. Tools are fairly simple to figure out & pretty intuitive. Tip: Play around with layers & the transparency slider of each. You can create really cool effects. No ads, just free.\n\nNext are a couple of Open-Source image editors with a familiar feel. If Photoshop is The “God of Thunder” these two are the other Hemsworth brothers. I prefer Paint.net as it is a little simpler UI than GIMP but that’s just a matter of personal taste. They are both great analogs to the OG adobe product.\n\nhttps://www.getpaint.net/\n\n[https://www.gimp.org/](https://www.gimp.org/)\n\nNext up is Canva. I’ve only recently started using this but I’m finding it indispensable, for text effects especially.\n\n[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/canva-design-photo-video/id897446215](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/canva-design-photo-video/id897446215)\n\nNow a few things I gleaned from the NFT.NYC award presentation. First of all, the way the slides were done was perfect. Seeing all the submissions followed by the winner made it really fun to watch. If you haven’t seen it I encourage you to watch <https://youtu.be/8f2pb31GPuQ> There were a couple of things I noticed that gave people an edge in quality. First, Borders. Borders. Borders. Even just a thin, slightly inset border can make a huge difference. The other big one is Contrast. A look at my PFP should make it obvious I’m a sucker for high contrast. There were quite a few entries that were amazing uses of this. It doesn’t have to be as stark as black & yellow. In some cases darkening or lightening contrast or using complementary colors can make a world of difference. The right color or shade can make an image pop in all the right places.\n\nThis isn’t everything in my personal arsenal but hopefully, it’s a good start for this event.

{"id": "XxIpu6cDQjO2vBm9goWxdYW52XGjK5ZfgEJK24yjdGo", "title": "POAPathon: Artist Resources ", "body": "**Fonts, Text, & Lettering**\n\nAlright, this is gonna be a ‘Font, Text, &/or Lettering’ specific post. I tend to sometimes obsess on this part of illustration too much & which has led me to find & compile some great resources & shortcuts over the years. I mean, I think we all know that ‘Helvetica’ is the G.O.A.T. (😁😉) but it can’t be used for EVERYTHING. In the rare cases when something else is required here are a few of my favorite apps, sites, & shortcuts. Including one “Alpha drop” I’ve used for a while but never ever revealed, until now. \n\nFirst a mention about my last post. Regarding the aforementioned Autodesk® ‘Sketchbook’ I posted an iOS store link for but I should’ve also mentioned that it’s available on Mac, Windows, & Android/Google Play as well. Though, the Mac & Windows versions (*$19.99*) aren’t free like the iOS & Android apps. \n\nSketchbook®\n\n<https://www.sketchbook.com/>\n\n\\*\\**BTW if ‘Autodesk’ sounds familiar it could be because you are or know an architect, engineer, draftsman, or similar.  Autodesk, Inc. is probably best known for their widely used, O.G., flagship product* AutoCAD*®*\n\nNow the fonts, text, & lettering. \n\nFirst up, a quick solution to install new fonts, both OTF & TTF extensions, on both iOS & Android. Why this matters is because once installed those fonts become available on a majority of Applications such as Sketchbook®. The importance of this was made painfully clear to me over the previous year. Autodesk didn’t provide updates for Sketchbook® on iOS & this functionality eventually stopped working. I was elated when the updates resumed, due to popular demand, as this feature became immediately available again. There are many apps to make installation easy but my go-to is the free & easy-to-use iFont.\n\niFont: <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ifont-find-install-any-font/id1173222289>\n\nNext, is an app whose usefulness is immediately obvious. If you have an image of a movie logo, for example, or perhaps a wedding invite, lunch menu, or anything else with text. This one is a kinda specific OCR-type app that scans & searches for the name of that font. The results can vary depending on the font’s rarity, newness, popularity, or licensing status. Though, It almost always produces some results. Sometimes the only find may be something that looks similar but not entirely exact. Nonetheless, I have found it immensely useful, especially when designing a spoof or parody. \n\nWhat The Font: <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/whatthefont/id304304134>\n\nWeb Version: <https://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/>\n\nNow, what do you do once you find the font name you want? Download providers are plentiful. Here are a few of my favorites.\n\n<https://www.dafont.com/>\n\n[https://fontmeme.com/](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/)\n\n[https://www.fontspace.com](https://www.fontspace.com/popular/fonts)\n\n<https://www.1001freefonts.com/>\n\n<https://www.1001fonts.com/>\n\nFinally, the Alpha. I’ve already mentioned it & many of you may know it. A great font search website on its own, the other feature is where it pops though. With a low-key title like “Text Generator” overlooking how nifty this thing is understandable. If you haven’t figured it out yet it’s a sorta hidden functionality on FontMeme. Just visiting the center tab with the unsuspecting title will provide many interesting results to browse via thumbnail images, some of brands, albums, films, & TV. Searching for a specific one, ‘Toy Story’ for example, will take you to a page that will likely tell you the underlying font, possibly link a download, & provide a text box along with effects/color options. The result comes in the form of a handy PNG that you can “right-click, save as”. 😂\n\nProtips:\n\n* The font size defaults to 65. I usually change this to 200 as it produces the largest image with the best resolution. Any higher doesn’t really change or improve & can sometimes hinder quality.\n\n\n* Sometimes a specific result can elude the embedded search. If no result can be found using this try a search engine like Google or DuckDuckGo & enter the specific term followed by fontmeme. You could also try formatting said search using Google Advanced Search Operators. (*I have a cheat sheet if anyone is interested*). \n\nHope these are useful. That’s all for now. \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1636220752, "digest": "jSunB0Apw-x9CrrU-ar7fo9gBzuB6W96KRY65NlIVf0", "contributor": "0x0614e07756390441CB246c886917487840e74f7d"}
{"id": "YKRwX0kTiROp5TkSxI2wESmW1Ydgb5be6zAntE0vkSI", "title": "Delimerence", "body": "## The Pill\n\n**DeLimerence XR**\n*Take One Capsule By Mouth Daily*\n\n— read the green pill bottle that Thomas was holding. This was going to change everything for him. He tried to temper his excitement by telling himself that he still had to be deliberate about his actions once he took what was inside the plastic cylinder he held. “This is not a magic bean,” he kept repeating to himself.  His first few failed attempts to pry open the bottle dampened the peak of his narrative arc a bit. After soldiering on and cursing himself, he finally held the red translucent capsule in his hand. He stared at it for a few seconds\n\n“Was this still a good idea?”\n\n“Would I get addicted to it and be unable to fall in love later in life when I want to?”\n\n“Would it somehow affect my ability to play tennis?”\n\nHe remembered something vague that he had read about how the drug affects heart rate.\n\nThe answers to his questions were on the medical information sheet that lay on the table. He did not bother to check it. He knew all that he needed to know about DeLimerence before he went to the psychiatrist.\n\nDeLimerence would stop him from feeling frantic, anxious, and out of control whenever he really liked a girl. This had held him back his whole adult life. He would like someone he met on a dating app or at a party, or for a brief moment at a coffee shop.\n\n“It could practically happen anywhere anytime,” he remembered telling the psychiatrist.\n\n“I would really unreasonably like this person and then completely lose my mind over them,” Thomas had explained when the psychiatrist had asked, “why are you here?”\n\n“I would then be unable to concentrate on my game during the matches, text her too much, become a real nervous wreck with extreme mood swings. It affected everything I did, and nothing good came out of it,” Thomas explained as he looked out the window of the psychiatrist’s office, envious of the trees that swayed gently in the wind, seemingly enjoying a better life than him.\n\nIn the middle of his explainer, Thomas noticed that he was having a hard time even making eye contact with the psychiatrist. He tried to turn his head towards the person in front of him, but his eyes landed squarely at the bottom of a bookshelf, fixating on a kitschy photo frame that read, “You are loved and important.”\n\nHe knew that the psychiatrist was just a pawn to make quick work of in the medical-industrial complex. He was going to ask him all the questions off DSM-IV, check off boxes, give him the pill.\n\n“Did you hear about any drugs for this elsewhere? Did someone recommend this to you?” the psychiatrist had asked as Thomas finished his sentence.\n\n“No,” he responded without a moment’s delay.\n\nOn the back of his mind was the subreddit r/unalovebomber that had put him onto the diagnosis he was seeking. It had been yet another torrid week. Thomas had gone on a single date with someone he met on Hinge. He had kept his cool before the date even though the long texts had built anticipation. He kept repeating his usual mantras in the shower just before the date “keep it cool, enjoy yourself, even if nothing happens, you get to enjoy someone’s company.” And then the date had gone extraordinarily well. They were both athletes - Thomas, a tennis player, ranked #400 in the world, Maddie a triathlete who worked as a nurse. They spent 6 hours talking about life, books, music, childhood stories. A day passed, Thomas held onto his nerve and did not double text, and then he got the text\n\n> You’re a great guy but I don’t think it’s a match. Hope you have a great career and make it to the top 250\n\nHe knew the drill. He had done this before and felt helpless about the fact that his baseline instincts were going to take over. Resent her, console himself by saying, “it’s her fucking loss”, watch porn and then after 4 hours when all coping mechanisms failed, weep and scream into the couch in his living room. The downstairs neighbors had filed a noise complaint the first time he cried when he moved into his new apartment, and the couch was a good acoustic cushion. After about 6 hours of this he had found new (or perhaps old) resolve to fix this once and for all and was on r/unalovebomber subreddit looking for inspiration, solutions or whatever hooked his mind. He found a post by r/epicureanjoel that he knew was going to change things and there was some sense of finality to it :\n\n> * I’ve been on DeLimerence XR for 100 days and it has completely transformed my life\\*\n> * I’ve been a 7/10 all my life, rarely had problems finding dates regularly but only met people I liked once in a while. And then when I met someone I liked, I would become a complete schizoid and show classic symptoms of a love bomber - sending too many messages, not taking any kind of negative reaction from her well, my mind would be completely out of place. Even got to the point where I almost lost a job because of this habit. Finally got diagnosed for affection processing disorder and got prescribed DeLimerance XR 10mg. I’ve been on 4 dates since starting medication, and it has gone great. I have a good time with them, don’t get anxious about text replies and you know what? 3 of those 4 dates have gone well, I’m still seeing them. Something about me being more cool and aloof about it definitely makes me more attractive to them and to myself. Don’t fall for the temporary displacement of ego that instant attraction or “love at first sight” offers. Get diagnosed and work on yourself.\\*\n\nIt all came down to this moment now. Thomas had read that it takes anywhere between 30 minutes to one hour for DeLimerence XR to take effect. The most common dosage instruction on r/unalovebomber was to take it when you were actively dating. It was Friday, and Thomas had a few matches on his dating app that he had not initiated conversations with. He was also planning to go to a house concert with a friend, Vijayan, in the evening. ‘Friend’ was too generous a definition for their relationship. Men who are in their 30s don’t have friends. Their lives are like airports, people come and go, stay awhile, make conversation, but eventually, they leave like they originally intended to.\n\nThomas felt an easiness about texting the girls on the app. Not excited, not nervous and on edge. Not craving approval like he always used to. He even flirted when they replied back. He had a picture of him wearing a t-shirt based on the PT Anderson movie There Will Be Blood, and someone he matched with commented.\n\n“Nice t-shirt btw. I love that movie.”\n\nAnd Thomas, to his own surprise, had replied “Haha who knows may be you’ll get to wear it someday”.\n\n2 hours in, he tried to cast doubt over the effect of the medicine, maybe he had just convinced himself that the pill works, and nothing substantial had actually changed in his brain chemistry. But he also did not want to find out. He liked the way it felt and planned to continue to do so. He tried to remember the names of the girls on the dating app he had ended up making plans with and could not remember. “Doesn’t matter. I have plans with them and it’s just a first date anyway,” he told himself. It was time to find out whether this drug helped with social anxiety when talking with women.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Club\n\nThomas was meeting Vijayan at the club where the House concert was happening. Vijayan was a gay Indian American that his first generation immigrant parents were proud of. He had gone through  all the layers of professional success that Asian immigrant parents could think of - graduating from Carnegie Mellon, a Harvard MBA with consulting experience in the big three, stock in a Silicon Valley company that went public a year ago. He had defeated all of his parents’ expectations. So complete was his victory that when Vijayan went home to visit them, they let him sleep in the master bedroom while they slept in the guest room. But despite all this, he struggled with relationships, often ending up in ones were he was physically abused. Thomas understood that they hung out despite being part of different social classes because of this love sickness that they shared. It came with perks such as free tickets to a Tiesto concert or regular refills of Ketamine, the good kind.\n\nAs the Uber pulled up to the club, Thomas reminded himself not to talk about taking DeLimerence. He kept telling himself that this was an intimate detail that no one needed to know about him. Yet, on some level he was also ashamed that he needed a drug to feel the way normal humans probably felt and operated.\n\n“Thomas, you look different today. Did you shave?” Vijayan asked as he caught Thomas just as he was scanning his ticket.\n\nThomas chuckled nervously. Had he been found out already, “Hey man, I guess so? Your shirt looks great btw”. A compliment was always an excellent way to deflect attention from oneself.\n\nAs they walked into the club, Thomas thought about how he would not choose this experience if he was single. It was too loud, there too many people, and everyone was trying hard to signal how hot they were and how they were different from their peers by 15% but not more. He was certain this was a feeling shared by others in the club as well, just that it was masked by whatever drug they were on or the affection they felt from the person standing next to them, sometimes a friend, sometimes a partner. He scanned around to see who he could talk to while Vijayan hovered around making conversation. He could sense that Vijayan was becoming more inebriated with each sentence that rolled out of his tongue, and within an hour or so he would just be an animated object that sometimes spoke gibberish for Thomas’s amusement.\n\nThere was a tall blonde girl wearing a short white dress drinking at the bar, away from everyone else. He considered her for a moment and his brain made the calculation within 5 seconds that she was perhaps too ambitious a target for understanding the effects of DeLimerence.\n\nHe instead squared in on the girl wearing a black crop and black high waist jeans, with long curly black hair. She was in a corner, holding a beer, she looked like an amused rabbit to Thomas. As he sipped his drink while standing next to her, Thomas examined his emotional state for a moment. His heart was quiet, he didn’t feel like his mind was racing, there were no indicators of fear. He felt euphoric and on a mission. He turned to her a couple of times, waiting for a moment where they made eye contact, and when it happened on the third try, he said “nice necklace, quite classic.”\n\n“Aw thanks. Well, funny story, I found it in an abandoned car near my house,” she replied, smiling. He could feel that her brain was quickly registering him and his body language.\n\nPerfect. Thomas thought to himself. She had responded with something to latch onto, and the conversation could now go places. As their conversation continued, Thomas would drift away in his head for moments in between to examine how he felt about    Remy, the woman he was talking to. He thought he was holding her at a distance and like he knew where the conversation was going to go next and where to take it. This was a new and interesting sensation for Thomas, who usually found himself blank when he was smitten by someone - it was not that he did not have anything to ask or say. In fact, it was that his mind was traveling at 100 mph, trying to narrow down on a single thing from the myriad of thoughts that flew by.\n\n“So is this what you do on Fridays? Smooth talk women in dim-lit clubs?” Remy asked.\n\nThomas smirked, put his hand to his chest and replied, “Aww I’m heartbroken that you think that of me while here I am thinking I don’t run into interesting people like you”, and ran his palm on the inside of her elbow. What he said would have been true a week before, but not today. Today it felt like a lie, and he felt okay with it. This what be must courtship means to people now, he thought as he felt Remy standing closer to him.\n\nThere comes a moment in time while at a club where the effect of drugs and the music crescendo and everyone feels like they share a fleeting communal moment. After that peak, things tend to go downhill. As this moment approached, Thomas was further sure that he was going home with Remy tonight. He looked around for Vijayan and saw him standing against the bar, drink in his hand, his eyes looking like they were searching for something, perhaps trying to find the last ounce of energy in him to co-ordinate the movement of his body. Thomas, for the first time since they started hanging out, felt terrible for Vijayan. He even detested him a bit. “I guess hanging out with people like this is why I never had any luck with women,” he thought to himself.\n\n“Bunch of fucking beta cucks,” he thought as he planted his lips on Remy’s while gripping her close.\n\nWhen they had sex at Remy’s place, Thomas did not feel like he was falling in love or incredibly attracted to her. The sex was fine. Thomas never took deep pleasure from it except for the one time he was in a two-year relationship. It felt mechanical, but he felt powerful if it elicited reactions from the woman he was with, so that is what he focussed on. He was glad that he did not feel like staying for long after like he usually did, lingering on in the aftermath, hoping there is something deeper there. He felt cured.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Court\n\nThomas was playing the best tennis of his life.\n\nHe was in the quarterfinal of an ATP 500 tournament for the first time in his life.\n\nEvery time he got knocked out of the tournament, his coach said, “You need to be ruthless. You need a bit more of that fuck you attitude that the best players have”. He felt that in his approach on court in this tournament, he would not let it up now. He had won the last game 6-0, 6-1 and let out a guttural war cry at the end of the game. The crowd booed, but Thomas felt invigorated by being the hated one for once, not the nice guy. “Like the best in the business”, he thought to himself.\n\nToday he was up against world number 105 Felix Oviedo. As he warmed up for the game, he thought about the last three weeks since he started DeLimerence XR. He had been with three women, all three of whom he left on read. He liked to think the control he felt reflected elsewhere, including his game. He was not wrong. DeLimerence had made him more ruthless, calculated in unexplainable ways. “You never know how its going to affect you until you take. Different people have different results” read a user’s post on r/UnaLovebomber\n\nAs he warmed up for the game, he saw Felix walk into the court. He was accompanied by his coach and a woman who looked like his girlfriend. She was above average height for a woman, wearing a flowing dark blue dress that stopped above her knee, a white hat, and round green sunglasses. She stood by Felix as he talked with his coach, running her palm over his shoulders, brushing something off his face. They exchanged glances often, sometimes pecking each other on the lips. Thomas was distracted and annoyed by this. He felt something inside him sink, a feeling that he had not experienced since he started DeLimerence. He took a few deep breaths and tried to remember if he had taken DeLimerence today. He clearly remembered the green bottle in his hand about an hour ago. He felt this moment would pass, so he resumed his training, trying to focus on finding the middle of the racket with every hit. Fourth shot of a new rally with his went flying into the stands. Mishits happen. He reset himself with a few more bounces of the ball and glances at his watch. The next three returns sprayed across the court - two of them going too far and one hitting the net.\n\n“Calm down Thoma” his French coach urged from the other side.\n\nAs he walked out the court, yielding the rest of the time to Felix for his warm-up, he glanced at the couple who were sharing an embrace, and Thomas felt defeated.\n\nHe sat in the dressing room 20 minutes before the game, wondering what had hit him. His mind was racing again and seemed like it was searching for reasons to explain this. When he remembered that he had no one with him except for the coach he was paying to be there, he felt a sense of inevitability. The return of the same memories, like a fly stuck to honey. Thomas was not going to give up now. This was his moment, and he had to make it last. His body had been under stress throughout the tournament, and it needed more replenishment than it usually did. Perhaps it applied to DeLimerence too. The current dosage did not have the desired effect.  There was no great conflict in coming to this decision, so he took another 10mg pill of DeLimerence XR 10 minutes before he went on court.\n\nThe game with Felix was harder than his last.  The first set went to Felix. The second went to the tie break. Thomas was on set point. He reset his mind by remembering Tchivosky overture 1812. The music peaked in Thomas’s head as he brought the ball to the racket and raised his hands to serve for the set. He heard a “Cmon Felix” from behind him when he released the ball but Thomas felt an easiness come over his body, and his racket swung down on the ball, and he knew he had hit an ace the moment the ball hit the sweet spot. Felix did not move. Thomas did not feel the need to. Instead, he turned around to where the words of encouragement had come from. It was the girlfriend. He pumped his fist and then drummed it against his chest while looking directly at her. The match was won in that moment. The next set finished 6-2 in Thomas’s favor. He had made it to the semifinal of an ATP 500 tournament.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Hotel\n\nIt had been 6 hours since he took the second 10mg pill. He was going to feel the effect of the drug well into the night. Thomas was about to head out to get dinner. He expanded his chest as he looked at himself in the mirror. He stared into his reflection and could not recognize the fierceness in the eyes of the person that stared back at him. He usually rested after games, nursing wounds, doing plyometric exercises to get in shape for the next game, which was tomorrow. But today, he wanted to go out. He needed to be with a woman and wanted the world to know he could have anyone he wants at this moment.\n\nGoing alone to dinner was something he rarely did, and never at a restaurant with $$$ on Google maps. As the waitress guided him to a table, he noticed no one at the bar counter seats except for a woman wearing a white summer dress with a low back cut. He asked the waitress if he could be seated at the bar instead and moved in that direction before the waitress could respond. He glanced in the direction of the woman as he sat two seats away from her and smiled at her when she looked to see who had decided to dare to disturb her solitude.\n\nThe bar tables overlooked the ocean through floor-to-ceiling glass windows. The restaurant was on the 3rd floor, and at Thomas’s eye line, it seemed as if the restaurant was floating on the ocean. The last tinge of yellow of the sun refracted through the bottles of alcohol lined up a 30-foot shelf.\n\nThe waitress had taken his order, and the bartender had turned away after taking an order for an old fashioned from the woman in white. Thomas saw the opportunity for an opening.\n\n“So you’re a fellow whiskey lover?” He asked.\n\nShe turned to Thomas, smiled assuredly and replied, “Is that the best opening line that you’ve got?”.\n\nThomas was not fluttered the least by it. He had got good or at least felt good about dealing with volleys such as this one.\n\n“Would you rather talk about how beautiful the weather is, or should I remark on the beauty of the ocean?” He replied without taking his eye off hers.\n\nShe looked away before he did, into the glass in front of her “sorry, I didn’t mean to be rude, I’m Sarah, and yes, I do love a good whiskey,” she said as she raised the glass towards him.\n\n“I’m Thomas. I love a good whiskey too, especially today,” Thomas replied, leaving it open for a question.\n\n“What happened today?”\n\n“Just won a game of tennis,” Thomas said, with understatement in his voice.\n\n“Are you a tennis player?”\n\n“Yes,” replied Thomas as he noticed that Sarah had shifted her body towards him and was looking at his face intently, searching for something. Thomas mistook this for interest so he continued, “Playing someone ranked 51st in the world tomorrow actually.”\n\nSarah interrupted the conversation.\n\n“Sorry. Are you on DeLimerence?” She asked.\n\nThomas gulped and flashbacked to the experience he had had before he starting taking Delimerence - one of his mind traveling at an enormous speed trying to find a response that would make him feel less judged. But nothing bubbled up to the top of his mind to fill the void in the nick of time.\n\n“How did you know” he finally replied, almost defeated but not showing it on his face.\n\n“You have that look in your eyes,” Sarah replied, feeling slightly guilty that she had brought it up.\n\nThomas was staring at his drink and then into the ocean.\n\n“It’s alright, I’m on it too,” she replied, hoping it would soften the blow.\n\nThis piqued his head. “You’re on DeLimerence? Have you been with someone on DeLimerence before?” Thomas asked.\n\n“No, why would I want to be with someone who’s just like me?” She replied and then chuckled as she ended that sentence.\n\nThomas wondered why the effect of DeLimerence was not working at this moment. Was it a placebo all this while? He felt like he needed to impress this woman so that she would go home with him and at the same time resented her.\n\n“What is this look in my eyes that you noticed?” Thomas asked as he composed himself and looked Sarah in the eyes. The sounds of the bar, the conversations, clinking glasses came into sharp focus as he asked this.\n\n“The look of deep amusement with yourself and how you are.”\n\n“Like you’d fall in love with your reflection any moment now.”\n\nThomas crumbled. He wanted to yell at her, maybe even hit her. He looks at his palms that were face down on the table. They were trembling, with anxiety or anger. Thomas was not sure.\n\nHe continued eating and finishing his drink while he and Sarah both sat in the quietness of the bar counter. When it turned dark, the ocean was not visible anymore. It seemed that nothing existed outside of the window. Just an unassuming void.\n\nSarah got up to leave first and glanced at Thomas, who never lifted his head up. She walked out. Thomas could hear the sound of her heels moving further away. He felt relieved for a moment. And then he started ruminating on the game tomorrow.\n\n“What if DeLimerence does not work anymore? It does not seem to have any effect in this moment,” he thought to himself.\n\nHe felt a cold wave build up in his head like his nerves were tingling against his skull, and this sensation washed across his spine, and he felt his eyes well up, like he had no control over it. Finally, he brought himself back to the moment and collected himself enough to pay the check.\n\nA cool evening breeze hit his face as he walked out of the restaurant. For a couple of seconds, after he forgot where he had been and what had just transpired, a sense of peace crept in, only to be violently jolted out of it by an intrusive thought, “Wish I could share this with someone.” His mind and body were pulling him in opposite directions, one racing ahead and the other crashing down. Thomas held his nerve till he got to his hotel room, and then as soon as the door was closed behind him, he collapsed on the ground face first. He felt his chest heaving and a scream building up in his throat, and he let it out. He felt tears rushing down his cheeks.\n\nAt this moment, his inner voice reverted to what it had been taught as a child. “Why don’t you go fucking kill yourself” it demanded, and Thomas wailed harder to drown out the voice. Until his body was tired and could not generate any more thoughts.\n\nThere is a sense of clarity that fills the space that fills the space of sadness once it has left the body. The first lucid thought told Thomas that he would probably kill himself if he goes through a similar evening again. He had read about DeLimerence crashes on r/UnaLoveBomber.\n\nThomas had given up. DeLimerence was not going to save him. The game with world number 51 was lost before it had begun.\n\n## Let it go\n\nThomas looked around and saw people trickle into the stadium. This would be the biggest crowd he had played in front of, and it did not mean anything to him. He could feel the texture of the handle of the racket in his hand, his breath against his nostrils, foot firm yet nimble and ready to move. As he hit back ball after ball that his coach served him, he felt he had more time than ever before. Every ball seemed to be hitting the racket’s sweet spot, yet it was not bringing him the dopamine hits it usually did.  It just was.\n\nWhen the match began, the crowd was on the side of tournament favorite and world number 51 Grigor Milov. Thomas could hear chants of “Grigor, Grigor” as he lined up to serve, he closed his eyes for a moment and the chants transformed “Thomas, Thomas” in his head, and it crescendoed as he barreled down some of the fastest serves of his life. Bu the first set still went the way of the experienced Grigor 7-5.\n\nGrigor expected the fight to be over after a decisive first set but unknown to him Thomas was neither deflated nor trying to motivate himself for the next set. The intensity did not abate in this second set and this caught Grigor off guard - he lost 6-4.\n\nThe crowd had turned against him now. They were behind this kid, ranked who knows what, playing his first ATP 500 semifinal taking it to the tournament favorite.\n\nThe third set went to a tie break. Grigor was on match point. As he walked up to serve, Thomas felt like he was inhabiting his body for the first time. He existed, not inside his head or in anyone else’s but on that hard court. And as he rallied against Grigor, there was nothing else. It was the longest rally of the match which ended with a backhand winner along the line from Grigor that Thomas could not get to.\n\n## Fresh Air\n\nThomas sat in a coffee shop the day after. Something about the game felt distant. He sat at a table under a tree. He experienced fleeting moments of quietness that coincided with the rustle of the leaves in the gentle summer afternoon breeze.\n\nThomas saw the girl across from him. She was scribbling on a notebook with a couple of pens around her. She smiled when she noticed Thomas. They struck up a conversation for the next 45 minutes. Thomas asked her about her art, where she started, how she got here. She asked him about what it was like being a professional player. They both agreed that there was no money is what they were doing unless they were in the top 100 of what they were doing.\n\nFor Thomas, she felt like someone who had made peace with herself. There was a sense of quiet assuredness about her that radiated. Her life felt like a work of art. He felt the need to make this moment last, maybe ask her phone number. His mind peaked ahead into what dating her might be like. Then he stood up, wished her good luck with her art, and then walked away.", "timestamp": 1636220336, "digest": "hGSEXCY7iphsoO2_N1dbGqhQRfCH4c9fMmRGMC42-sg", "contributor": "0x02Dad585640b1929d88296687918d7751717Ccaa"}
{"id": "jdx5A-vreX5wD167jbdNKPJU48TAM3t2lJHzk4V_BUM", "title": "Artist Resources: Fonts, Text, & Lettering", "body": "Alright, this is gonna be a ‘Font, Text, &/or Lettering’ specific post. I tend to sometimes obsess on this part of illustration too much & which has led me to find & compile some great resources & shortcuts over the years. I mean, I think we all know that ‘Helvetica’ is the G.O.A.T. (😁😉) but it can’t be used for EVERYTHING. In the rare cases when something else is required here are a few of my favorite apps, sites, & shortcuts. Including one “Alpha drop” I’ve used for a while but never ever revealed, until now.\n\nFirst a mention about my last post. Regarding the aforementioned Autodesk® ‘Sketchbook’ I posted an iOS store link for but I should’ve also mentioned that it’s available on Mac, Windows, & Android/Google Play as well. Though, the Mac & Windows versions (*$19.99*) aren’t free like the iOS & Android apps.\n\nSketchbook®\n\n[https://www.sketchbook.com/](https://www.sketchbook.com/)\n\n\\*\\**BTW if ‘Autodesk’ sounds familiar it could be because you are or know an architect, engineer, draftsman, or similar.  Autodesk, Inc. is probably best known for their widely used, O.G., flagship product* AutoCAD*®*\n\nNow the fonts, text, & lettering.\n\nFirst up, a quick solution to install new fonts, both OTF & TTF extensions, on both iOS & Android. Why this matters is because once installed those fonts become available on a majority of Applications such as Sketchbook®. The importance of this was made painfully clear to me over the previous year. Autodesk didn’t provide updates for Sketchbook® on iOS & this functionality eventually stopped working. I was elated when the updates resumed, due to popular demand, as this feature became immediately available again. There are many apps to make installation easy but my go-to is the free & easy-to-use iFont.\n\niFont: <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ifont-find-install-any-font/id1173222289>\n\nNext, is an app whose usefulness is immediately obvious. If you have an image of a movie logo, for example, or perhaps a wedding invite, lunch menu, or anything else with text. This one is a kinda specific OCR-type app that scans & searches for the name of that font. The results can vary depending on the font’s rarity, newness, popularity, or licensing status. Though, It almost always produces some results. Sometimes the only find may be something that looks similar but not entirely exact. Nonetheless, I have found it immensely useful, especially when designing a spoof or parody.\n\nWhat The Font: <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/whatthefont/id304304134>\n\nWeb Version: <https://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/>\n\nNow, what do you do once you find the font name you want? Download providers are plentiful. Here are a few of my favorites.\n\n[https://www.dafont.com/](https://www.dafont.com/)\n\n[https://fontmeme.com/](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/)\n\n[https://www.fontspace.com](https://www.fontspace.com/popular/fonts)\n\n[https://www.1001freefonts.com/](https://www.1001freefonts.com/)\n\n[https://www.1001fonts.com/](https://www.1001fonts.com/)\n\nFinally, the Alpha. I’ve already mentioned it & many of you may know it. A great font search website on its own, the other feature is where it pops though. With a low-key title like “Text Generator” overlooking how nifty this thing is understandable. If you haven’t figured it out yet it’s a sorta hidden functionality on FontMeme. Just visiting the center tab with the unsuspecting title will provide many interesting results to browse via thumbnail images, some of brands, albums, films, & TV. Searching for a specific one, ‘Toy Story’ for example, will take you to a page that will likely tell you the underlying font, possibly link a download, & provide a text box along with effects/color options. The result comes in the form of a handy PNG that you can “right-click, save as”. 😂\n\nProtips:\n\n* The font size defaults to 65. I usually change this to 200 as it produces the largest image with the best resolution. Any higher doesn’t really change or improve & can sometimes hinder quality.\n* Sometimes a specific result can elude the embedded search. If no result can be found using this try a search engine like Google or DuckDuckGo & enter the specific term followed by fontmeme. You could also try formatting said search using Google Advanced Search Operators. (*I have a cheat sheet if anyone is interested*).\n\nHope these are useful. That’s all for now.", "timestamp": 1636220813, "digest": "jSunB0Apw-x9CrrU-ar7fo9gBzuB6W96KRY65NlIVf0", "contributor": "0x0614e07756390441CB246c886917487840e74f7d"}

Each recipient was able to share the tokens with people in their network and help them start publishing and enjoy the Mirror toolkit. Many of these new members have gone on to create valuable projects and build their own vibrant communities, raising awareness around Mirror and creating more value within our ecosystem.\n\nIn many cases, it’s hard to know who will provide incredible value to our community until they start contributing. We must **reflect as a community** on contributions and retroactively reward those who build alongside us. **We would like your help to find and reward those actively contributing to the Mirror ecosystem.**\n\n### Today we are proud to announce the Mirror Reflection Awards\n\nThese awards will become (with your support) an ongoing recognition to people, communities, and projects that help drive the web3 ecosystem forward, with special appreciation for those teams building on top of the Mirror tools.  We have already seen a number of high quality independent developer projects, as well as curatorial efforts, emerge around the creative output of Mirror. We as an ecosystem have a big opportunity to further reward and encourage builders and contributors like these.\n\n![A celebration of generosity, ingenuity, and mutual support.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bnSKHENFZZucn0vjrR18U.png?height=971&width=1945)\n\nEach award consists of 1 $WRITE token for the winner, agreed through a community-wide proposal and vote. Award winners will be welcomed into the community as Mirror Members and can set up their project on an official Mirror subdomain. They'll also be able to participate in Mirror governance.\n\nWe invite the current Mirror Members to [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/DG9Trafxpe), say hello at our **First Townhall on Tuesday, November 9th at 3pm EST (12:00 PST, 19:00 UTC)**, review the list of winners proposed by the community, and then approve them via an upcoming governance vote.\n\n**The awards approval vote will be open for a period of 72 hours starting on Tuesday, November 9th.**\n\n\n---\n\nMirror, too, began with a story: a home for you to not only share your story with the world, but to grow those stories alongside highly-engaged communities, fueled by economic ownership enabled by Mirror’s crypto-native tools. We are excited to welcome more leaders who have not only shown a commitment to building alongside us, but who will continue to steward and shepherd the best stories and communities in web3.\n\n**Join us as we collectively discover our next chapter!**", "timestamp": 1636226154, "digest": "BiSr8kDJa8Z577xkxL4E5BjuVMhNTv8PR4TkAGv6D6c", "contributor": "0x112DCc89081C474b881F0ca2668F08c987679Fea"}

Hoe kan het dat het land, dat er lange tijd naar streefde om het virus volledig te elimineren, nu juist versoepelt bij oplopende besmettingscijfers?\n\nNieuw-Zeeland kende lange tijd een bijzondere aanpak in de strijd tegen het coronavirus. De bedoeling was dat het virus helemaal geëlimineerd zou worden door de grenzen hermetisch gesloten te houden, behalve voor Nieuw-Zeelanders.\n\nTussen april en juli dit jaar was er wel een zogenoemde Trans-Tasman-reisbubbel met Australië, waardoor inwoners van beide landen naar hun buurland konden reizen. Lange tijd ging dit goed, en bleven de besmettingen in Nieuw-Zeeland uit. Maar toen afgelopen zomer de eerste besmettingen met de deltavariant in Australië werden gemeld, schortte Nieuw-Zeeland de reisbubbel toch op.\n\nHet mocht niet baten: halverwege augustus maakte Nieuw-Zeeland melding van de eerste besmetting met de deltavariant. Kort erna werd de eerste [lockdown](https://www.nu.nl/coronavirus/6151749/nieuw-zeeland-gaat-voor-het-eerst-in-jaar-tijd-weer-in-lockdown.html) in een jaar tijd aangekondigd.

She nodded.\n\n\"Nobody touched her. We were just waiting for you to join us\" said the Messenger.\n\n\"Here is what you want.\" I handed over the device.\n\nThe messenger put it on the table's interface, the room lit up, she was mesmerized by the data flows. She seemed to forget us.\n\n\"There's nothing like this. Nobody has this. No crew, no co-op has this. It's too bad, that I don't believe this is all of it.

Our imagination can transform a seed into a sapling, and a sapling into a forest.\n\n**Pioneers returned from distant lands stored in faraway machines, and returned with more of the \"new\", seeds of the future.**\n\n**That was enough to convince many to head out, and never return.**\n\n**2877, Earth, The Necklace**\n\nThe moment I exited the consulate, someone stepped outside of one of the floaters parked outside.\n\nJust 3 days after the fight, her arm was no longer in a sling.\n\nEye contact. I got in the backseat.\n\n\"Foundry district\", she gestured to her arm, \"Military nanos. Your friend is safe.\"\n\nThe floater left the diplomatic quarter, past the marketplace square, and flew over a landscape that was part-war museum and part-construction site. The war factories were dismantling themselves.\n\nWe landed in the middle of an old co-op campus. Moments later, I was inside an office, so was the \"messenger\" I fought 3 days ago.\n\n**Some of the pieces connected in my mind:**\n\nShe's not a messenger, she's young, this shadow co-op was an old crew.She’s not in charge but is shooting for the job.Or she’s in charge and got rid of the old boss.They brought Andreea into the office.They didn’t blindfold me on the way here.That’s a problem.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" It looked like Andreea was unharmed. She nodded.\n\n\"Nobody touched her. We were just waiting for you to join us\" said the Messenger.\n\n\"Here is what you want.\" I handed over the device.\n\nThe messenger put it on the table's interface, the room lit up, she was mesmerized by the data flows. She seemed to forget us.\n\n\"There's nothing like this. Nobody has this. No crew, no co-op has this. It's too bad, that I don't believe this is all of it. Tie them up.”\n\nIt was going to be torture this time if I let it happen.Nothing to lose, it was time for another fight.Then the room exploded in light.Was it the police?\n\nSomeone walked in.\n\n**”Someone stole from my employer. The Dowager sends her regards.”**\n\n[https://audius.co/rodrigodtamay/mycelium-2](https://audius.co/rodrigodtamay/mycelium-2)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vjsphhj58gAytBOm_iaoL.png?height=1600&width=1200)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QyUUKo8jhvIg8X9YhCtOu.png?height=1600&width=1200)\n\n", "timestamp": 1636230851, "digest": "4Lf1SiWkl7usVlbQkB_FP3rHawhgFbWr8pxaVPRcBk4", "contributor": "0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f"}

Your entire collection is consistently striking. Can you tell us about your technique?\n\nMy NFTs are created digitally using a variety of tools. Sometimes I use acrylic and oil techniques, different canvas textures, and so on. I just use whatever I think is appropriate for that moment and piece. I like things clean and colourful (with a bit of madness).\n\n#### What is the inspiration behind the name “Lago”?\n\nI don't really remember why or how I got it. I just remember I signed my first piece directly with “Lago,” it came automatically. It's like I remembered it from a past life or something. It doesn't really have a story or anything. It just came naturally. When I signed it, it was as if my hands were moving on their own.

For this particular piece, I just chose the colours as I went along, it's not something I had premeditated.

I have other work to do and there are always responsibilities to attend to. I also tend to be interacting a lot with the NFT community on Twitter. There are some really passionate people there! And coffee is always a part of my day, lots of coffee.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Lago_artist/status/1410010209813139464?t=otT-6CEKOr6iIUZe0ecsZQ&s=19](https://twitter.com/Lago_artist/status/1410010209813139464?t=otT-6CEKOr6iIUZe0ecsZQ&s=19)\n\n#### You’ve mentioned loving the hours staring and working on a piece. Can you tell us more about that?\n\nYes, this is because I am a perfectionist with my art. Even though it is abstract art, for me it has to be perfect, even if it is impossible. I always try to look for the ideal composition and represent what I have in my head at that moment as much as possible. I really enjoy spending time with my compositions.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/44690](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/44690)\n\n#### Tell us about your thought process behind including a commercial license with your pieces. To me, they look like they could be great album covers. How does it feel to let go of your piece in this way?\n\nAll I want is to share my art with people and have them really enjoy it. I came across the [licenses that Yam shared on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/YKarkai/status/1398387574977273865?s=20) I liked the idea and decided to try it on some of my artwork.

How did it develop?\n\nI don't know exactly how it developed over the years, but it was always clear to me that artistic expression came naturally to me and that I had a specific passion for abstract art. As a kid, I started painting and everyone told me I was good but I never believed it. At one point, while I was still a kid, family and friends began to constantly ask me for pieces. The corporation where my mom worked wanted pieces too! They wanted some for their offices. But I got overwhelmed and stopped painting for good. Over the years I went to classes in different styles, drawing, etc., but it wasn’t my thing.\n\n[ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/646269](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/646269)\n\n#### Would you say that the classes limited your expression?\n\nYes, totally. I had to draw as the lady was telling me to. And I didn’t want to. Maybe what she was teaching was the correct way to do it... but maybe I didn't want to paint that shit. Let me paint my madness. I'm crazy, I'm fine with that. I was a problematic kid too; no one understood me.\n\n#### Maybe painting was a way for you to feel understood?\n\nYes, totally. It has always been my escape. In high school, I always needed to have some paper and pen in front of me to combat my boredom. I did graffiti too.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/59269](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/59269)\n\n#### You have a very professional image now. What was your first job?\n\nI have always had an entrepreneurial mindset. You could say that my first job was selling my classmates some notebooks that my mother was given at work. I needed to get my own money. I've always needed to earn my own money. The notebooks were completely normal, but I told my classmates that with them they could pretend to be doctors and they could prescribe medicines to each other. Kids were prescribing medicines to each other, I charged $2 per notebook, in-school, no costs, money came to me!\n\n#### That’s amazing. Do you have any paintings from when you were a kid?\n\nYes, I still have my first physical ever. And there’s a story behind it…\n\nOne day, I was painting on the floor of the paint shop/gallery where I used to paint. I was 8 years old. I used to paint like eight pieces in a single afternoon on the floor of that shop - I loved painting on the floor. A tourist came in, an older man. He saw my first piece there, called my mum, and told her that he would pay her any amount she wanted. My mum always said no to offers like this. He told her that this piece needed to go with him to some gallery in New York. It was common for me to receive offers on my pieces. But my mum would always say no. I didn't even know what was really happening, I didn't care. The image below is that first piece.\n\n![Lago's first composition.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dADWyCmaITipCoaZRQ2QN.jpeg?height=3024&width=4032)\n\n#### You said you stopped painting for a long time. What changed to get you to start again?\n\nSomething was always calling me. In silence, from the inside. I just felt it all the time, it was like a gentle latent pull. I bought new paints and tools to start again, but they were all just sitting in a bag and I didn’t feel like starting again. Discovering NFTs was the turning point. That's when I felt: okay, this is the way.\n\n#### Tell us more about what inspires you about NFTS. Why do you believe in their future?\n\nI discovered NFTs this March on some blog. I just saw the three letters and, I don't know why, but, it gave me an impulse to investigate what it was. From there I fell in love with everything about NFTs, especially the wonderful community we have here.\n\nI am fully confident that they will be something very big in the near future. The technology is exciting and being able to enjoy so much art and talent just a few clicks away really is a dream for many.\n\nI want to take the opportunity to give a huge thank you to my collectors so far: [@ramiaboulhosn94](https://twitter.com/ramiaboulhosn94), [@sigmastrange](https://twitter.com/sigmastrange), [@servkrillz](https://twitter.com/servkrillz), [@thisisaito](https://twitter.com/ThisIsAito), [@javiercarton](http://twitter.com/javiercarton), [@gettingsuited](http://twitter.com/gettingsuited), [@thetreyfisher](http://twitter.com/thetreyfisher).\n\n[ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/715441](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/715441)\n\n#### How long have you been digitally painting?\n\nI started long into the pandemic. I bought an iPad right away. My first mint was in March 2021, so yeah, around that date.\n\n#### That is absolutely remarkable.\n\nI have been and am currently going through quite a few rough moments, so I haven't been able to dedicate myself to this as much as I want to.

Anything crazy on your bucket list?\n\nI would love to be able to dedicate 100% of my time and soul to my art and be able to afford the luxury of living in many places around the world, meeting all kinds of wonderful people and living all kinds of experiences.\n\nI would like to spend some time in Barcelona, Amsterdam, Venice, and Canada. From what little I know, I am very attracted to the culture and atmosphere of these places.\n\nI want to go full-time on this.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/96842](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/96842)\n\n#### Thank you for sharing your art and vision with us!

I always try to look for the ideal composition and represent what I have in my head at that moment as much as possible.

How did it develop?\n\nI don't know exactly how it developed over the years, but it was always clear to me that artistic expression came naturally to me and that I had a specific passion for abstract art. As a kid, I started painting and everyone told me I was good but I never believed it. At one point, while I was still a kid, family and friends began to constantly ask me for pieces. The corporation where my mom worked wanted pieces too! They wanted some for their offices. But I got overwhelmed and stopped painting for good. Over the years I went to classes in different styles, drawing, etc., but it wasn’t my thing.\n\n[ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/646269](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/646269)\n\n#### Would you say that the classes limited your expression?\n\nYes, totally. I had to draw as the lady was telling me to. And I didn’t want to. Maybe what she was teaching was the correct way to do it... but maybe I didn't want to paint that shit. Let me paint my madness. I'm crazy, I'm fine with that. I was a problematic kid too; no one understood me.\n\n#### Maybe painting was a way for you to feel understood?\n\nYes, totally. It has always been my escape. In high school, I always needed to have some paper and pen in front of me to combat my boredom. I did graffiti too.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/59269](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/59269)\n\n#### You have a very professional image now. What was your first job?\n\nI have always had an entrepreneurial mindset. You could say that my first job was selling my classmates some notebooks that my mother was given at work. I needed to get my own money. I've always needed to earn my own money. The notebooks were completely normal, but I told my classmates that with them they could pretend to be doctors and they could prescribe medicines to each other. Kids were prescribing medicines to each other, I charged $2 per notebook, in-school, no costs, money came to me!\n\n#### That’s amazing. Do you have any paintings from when you were a kid?\n\nYes, I still have my first physical ever. And there’s a story behind it…\n\nOne day, I was painting on the floor of the paint shop/gallery where I used to paint. I was 8 years old. I used to paint like eight pieces in a single afternoon on the floor of that shop - I loved painting on the floor. A tourist came in, an older man. He saw my first piece there, called my mum, and told her that he would pay her any amount she wanted. My mum always said no to offers like this. He told her that this piece needed to go with him to some gallery in New York. It was common for me to receive offers on my pieces. But my mum would always say no. I didn't even know what was really happening, I didn't care. The image below is that first piece.\n\n![Lago's first composition.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dADWyCmaITipCoaZRQ2QN.jpeg?height=3024&width=4032)\n\n#### You said you stopped painting for a long time. What changed to get you to start again?\n\nSomething was always calling me. In silence, from the inside. I just felt it all the time, it was like a gentle latent pull. I bought new paints and tools to start again, but they were all just sitting in a bag and I didn’t feel like starting again. Discovering NFTs was the turning point. That's when I felt: okay, this is the way.\n\n#### Tell us more about what inspires you about NFTS. Why do you believe in their future?\n\nI discovered NFTs this March on some blog.

Lago has only been digitally painting since March 2021 and has already had multiple early successes (one of the most notable: a 1.25 ETH sale to [@thisisaito](http://twitter.com/thisisaito)). Lago’s most recent NFTs all include commercial licenses. We first met on Instagram over a shared interest in art, astrology, and travel.\n\n![Lago's signature.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j6t_tGdkanGkoSsv6UNFd.png?height=260&width=1440)\n\n### Fast Facts\n\n*Genre*: abstract expressionism\n\n*Media*: digital mixed media\n\n*Coffee shop order*: a good espresso, the stronger the better\n\n*Pets*: 2 dogs: one Doberman and one mixed-breed\n\n*Favourite TV character*: Raymond Reddington (as played by James Spader in The Blacklist)\n\n![A collage of Lago's early works, 2021.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oID4pzAc_WV8GVcoiARrY.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\n#### Hi Lago! Your entire collection is consistently striking. Can you tell us about your technique?\n\nMy NFTs are created digitally using a variety of tools. Sometimes I use acrylic and oil techniques, different canvas textures, and so on. I just use whatever I think is appropriate for that moment and piece. I like things clean and colourful (with a bit of madness).\n\n#### What is the inspiration behind the name “Lago”?\n\nI don't really remember why or how I got it. I just remember I signed my first piece directly with “Lago,” it came automatically. It's like I remembered it from a past life or something. It doesn't really have a story or anything. It just came naturally. When I signed it, it was as if my hands were moving on their own. Maybe that doesn’t sound believable, but that’s just what happened.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/55442](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/55442)\n\n#### Can you tell us about your choice of colours with Muse?\n\nI wanted it to be a passionate work, with strong and vivid colours. For this particular piece, I just chose the colours as I went along, it's not something I had premeditated. In general, I don’t really think about making a determined piece, I just create it as I feel it instantly.\n\n*[Read about the astrology of Muse here](https://astroviak.medium.com/the-astrology-of-muse-by-lago-bf81039b235b?source=friends_link&sk=f1576379095471b72b8b16e64c08f165).*\n\n#### What does a typical day look like for you?\n\nI try to dedicate as much time as possible to my art but it’s a challenge. I have other work to do and there are always responsibilities to attend to. I also tend to be interacting a lot with the NFT community on Twitter. There are some really passionate people there! And coffee is always a part of my day, lots of coffee.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Lago_artist/status/1410010209813139464?t=otT-6CEKOr6iIUZe0ecsZQ&s=19](https://twitter.com/Lago_artist/status/1410010209813139464?t=otT-6CEKOr6iIUZe0ecsZQ&s=19)\n\n#### You’ve mentioned loving the hours staring and working on a piece.

For this reason, subtle or apparent similarities can exist between a past and present event. The Pop Art movement from the ‘40s to ‘80s and the Crypto Art movement of today follow this hypothesis. Although emerging from disparate eras of human civilization, the parallels between these art movements are very telling.\n\nContrary to conventional discourse of style and iconography when analyzing different art movements, this work examines the relationship between Pop Art and Crypto Art in more extensive contexts.\n\n***Emergence*** is the first essay of a four-part series. It explores how significant innovations triggered social shifts among humans, thereby encouraging the birth of Pop Art and Crypto Art.\n\n## Second Industrial Revolution, Consumerism and Pop Culture\n\nThe Second Industrial Revolution marked the rise of consumerism and Pop Art was able to ride on this significant shift. The revolution was characterized by technological advancements that brought about a new energy source -- electricity. A new wave of organizations were able to harness electrical energy to facilitate mass production and soon a variety of products filled the market. Due to the enormous economic growth experienced in this era, better opportunities emerged that improved societal affluence and net spending power.\n\nOrganizations understood this trend and made the masses the locus of business decisions. This era also marked the incorporation of scientific principles in order to ensure homogeneity across products. Consequently, product homogeneity encouraged mimetic desire among the public and mass production coincided with their purchasing power to drive continuous consumption.\n\nInnovation occurred at a rapid pace during this era and resulted in the disruption of many industries. One of such was the mass media. The space was greeted with technologies like the television, which caused a seismic shift in the social interactions of the masses and the economic models of organizations. For the masses, a great deal of interaction with happenings in their surroundings and the rest of the world transitioned from audio (the radio) to audio plus visual.\n\nThe resonating effect of motion pictures was able to pull in all social classes. In no time, television became not only the town square for news, but a reflector of dreams and preferences across diverse aspects of life. Literally everything in an individual’s life revolved around the content disseminated through the television with movies, comics and film shows being the major catalysts of this shift. This occurrence intersected with the existent consumption society and gave rise to a common standard of lifestyle desired by the masses, known as popular (pop) culture.\n\nFor organizations, product homogeneity wasn’t enough to thrive; brand design, identity and reach became more significant than ever. Coupled with the advent of a new mass media technology, the market evolved to become open. New organizations debuted the scene and competition for consumers’ attention went fierce. This instigated the rise of commercial art. Manufacturing organizations employed commercial artists to create aesthetic brand designs in order to communicate the value of products as well as make it stand out from competitors.\n\nWith television already inseparable from the daily lives of masses, organizations positioned products through advertisements in order to attain reach. This trend resulted in the peak of the advertising industry and a further boom in mass consumption. Alongside movies, comics and film shows, the advertisement industry etched a spot as an influencer of pop culture. All of this was possible owing partly to the creative works of the employed commercial artists. From the comic characters used in shows, to movie posters, and brand designs of products, the commercial artist plays an indispensable role in the processes that elevate a brand to pop culture status.\n\nHaving experienced firsthand the profound effect television and pop culture evoked on the masses, some prescient commercial artists, who labeled themselves as The Independent Group, were spurred to elevate the aesthetic value of their works to a high art status. This signaled the advent of Pop Art.\n\nIn 1947, the first work considered as Pop Art was made by English artist Eduardo Paolozzi, a founding member of The Independent Group. The piece, I was a Rich Man’s Plaything,  is a collage which features clippings of advertisement images from magazines. The work takes its title from the words on the cover of *Intimate Confessions* magazine, which is also the most prominent clipping in the collage. Other clipped images in the collage include a bottle of Coca-Cola, the poster of a fighter jet and a sign labeled ‘POP’ from a gun which was aimed at a woman’s face. This was the first prominent use of the word ‘pop’ in an artwork, years before British writer Lawrence Alloway (also a member if the Independent Group) coined the term ‘Pop Art’ in 1958\n\nThe emergence of Pop Art instigated the trend where commercial art intersected with pop culture, not as a medium to promote a movie, film show or product to the masses, but as art worthy of aesthetic, professional and economic appreciation.\n\nFollowing its arrival in 1947, Pop Art served as an artistic reflection of a society whose consumption is driven by popular culture. This marked the influence of postmodernism (more on this in upcoming essay sequels) in art with London and New York becoming the new art centers of the world. Although the term ‘Pop Art’ was first coined in Britain in 1955, the Americans succeeded in propagating the tenet with much greater effect. Notable artists like Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, and James Rosenquist -- all with a commercial art background, played pivotal roles in the escalation of Pop Art in America.\n\n## Third Industrial Revolution and Digital Culture\n\nAs mass consumption increased, production processes demanded efficiency and optimization. This resulted in the start of the Third Industrial Revolution where computers were introduced to automate and digitize operations. Over time, significant improvements in the hardware (the microchip) and software components (the operating system) of the computer evolved it from an industrial equipment to an individual’s device. On top of that, the internet was invented and this positioned the computer in the driver’s seat of the revolution.\n\nThe internet flipped the old world and encouraged the rise of new types of organizations. These organizations built digital infrastructures that leveraged the internet and opened up new economic models. This enabled the masses to interact with computers for daily activities like communication, socializing, learning, finance, commerce, and so on, in a much more efficient manner. As more people got acquainted with the internet through the services offered by these organizations, widespread globalization followed.\n\nThe universal accessibility of the internet has created a digital culture among humans and morphed it into a mass communication tool. The internet being a hub for the spread of information, dreams, and relationships, and people using it for the majority of their activities evince the rise of digital culture. Furthermore, digital culture is evident in the obliteration of the hurdles between creation and distribution. Digital goods are now being created in abundance by users and a wealth of value is available for all to consume. New occupation opportunities have also opened up for individuals to create niche digital economies and earn a living. This has increased the collective wealth of human civilization.\n\nWith the internet already the new medium for mass interaction, attention to aesthetics became crucial and the digital art niche boomed. From the content consumed through the interfaces of digital infrastructures to internet advertisements, digital artists make the art and visuals that propagate the networks of these infrastructures.\n\nAlthough immensely beneficial, the abundance of digital goods on the internet comes with a major challenge: there’s no mechanism in place that accrues the economic value generated by a digital good, regardless of its popularity, usage and consumption on the internet. Piracy and infringement of intellectual and creative rights have been the consequences of this downside. In the same vein, art created by digital artists are not exempted from these consequences.\n\nIn an effort to alleviate this challenge, some digital infrastructures have resorted to setting up paywalls for digital art, but economic value still can’t be captured by artists. In fact, this move has turned out to be counterproductive as value is being accrued to the network, not the art nor its creator. Like the commercial art of the Second Industrial Revolution, the aesthetic value of digital art is relegated as a medium that serves the interfaces and networks of digital infrastructures.\n\nThe underlying reason behind the inability of digital goods to accrue economic value lies perhaps in its intangibility. It’s a long held perception that intangible elements cannot be owned and ownership has been a prerequisite for economic interactions between humans. This viewpoint argues that in a permissionless space like the internet, where anyone can create and/or duplicate anything, conferring ownership of digital goods is a futile effort. Where there’s no provable ownership, economic activities like trade, lending and borrowing can’t take place, hence no accrual of economic value on digital goods. However, as digital culture has taken center stage in human civilization, it’s become pertinent to bestow ownership of internet goods using digitally native mechanisms. By doing this, economics invariably kicks in and value accrual of digital goods is possible.\n\nToday, blockchain technology has experienced immense improvements. Blockchains are ledgers which record transactions and these ledgers are not controlled by a single entity, are available for all to see and cannot be changed arbitrarily once a transaction is recorded on it. These features make blockchains well suited for recording and proving ownership and transfer of digital goods.\n\nThe cryptographic mechanism that facilitates this innovation is known as the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) standard. This standard certifies unique and irreplicable ownership of a digital good, which makes the good non-fungible (that is, cannot be substituted) with other goods. Due to the public availability of blockchains, ownership of a digital good can now be proven/verified easily by anyone.\n\nThis technological shift alleviates the challenge experienced by creators of digital goods. In 2014, the first Crypto Art was tokenized by Kevin McCoy and Anil Dash on the NameCoin blockchain with Monegraph (Monetized Graphics), the first NFT platform -- also built by the duo. It was a significant event that marked the beginning of the Crypto Art movement.\n\nToday, many digital artists are adopting this innovation to confer and transfer (sell) ownership of their arts and for the first time in human civilization, the economic value of digital art can be accrued to owners. In the same way television and pop culture elevated commercial art to a high art status, internet, blockchain technology and digital culture are elevating digital art to art worthy of economic, aesthetic and professional appreciation.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe context behind the emergence of every movement is fundamentally cultural. From time immemorial, technology has always possessed the power to trigger a cultural shift, which in turn changes people's way of thinking.\n\nPop Art and Crypto Art are not art movements that introduce new style and iconography. Pop Art and Crypto Art are the artistic reflection of an unlearning and learning society, due to the advent of new innovations (television for pop art; blockchain for crypto art) which change people's way of life (pop culture for pop art; digital culture for crypto art).\n\n## Further Reading\n\n**[Timeline of Revolutions](https://manufacturingdata.io/newsroom/timeline-of-revolutions/)**\n\n**[Seven on Seven 2014: Kevin McCoy & Anil Dash](https://vimeo.com/96131398)**\n\n**[I Was a Rich Man’s Plaything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Was_a_Rich_Man%27s_Plaything)**", "timestamp": 1636253375, "digest": "J7tlK7DKZA6m3rdUAmniiXoEO4WkYQZy0IJAuURdlxg", "contributor": "0x39a45e576dDc0540D17B1c1CE2F6dc1656eD100c"}

For this reason, subtle or apparent similarities can exist between a past and present event. The Pop Art movement from the ‘40s to ‘80s and the Crypto Art movement of today follow this hypothesis. Although emerging from disparate eras of human civilization, the parallels between these art movements are very telling.\n\nContrary to conventional discourse of style and iconography when analyzing art movements, this work examines the relationship between Pop Art and Crypto Art in more extensive contexts like culture and innovation.\n\n***Emergence*** is the first essay of a three-part series. It explores how significant innovations triggered social shifts among humans, thereby encouraging the birth of Pop Art and Crypto Art.\n\n## Second Industrial Revolution, Consumerism and Pop Culture\n\nThe Second Industrial Revolution marked the rise of consumerism and Pop Art was able to ride on this significant shift. The revolution was characterized by technological advancements that brought about a new energy source -- electricity. A new wave of organizations were able to harness electrical energy to facilitate mass production and soon a variety of products filled the market. Due to the enormous economic growth experienced in this era, better opportunities emerged that improved societal affluence and net spending power.\n\nOrganizations understood this trend and made the masses the core of business decisions. This era also marked the incorporation of scientific principles in order to ensure homogeneity across products. Consequently, product homogeneity encouraged mimetic desire among the public and mass production coincided with their purchasing power to drive continuous consumption.\n\nInnovation occurred at a rapid pace during this era and resulted in the disruption of many industries. One of such was the mass media. The space was greeted with technologies like the television, which caused a seismic shift in the social interactions of the masses and the economic models of organizations. For the masses, a great deal of interaction with happenings in their surroundings and the rest of the world transitioned from audio (the radio) to audio plus visual.\n\nThe resonating effect of motion pictures was able to pull in all social classes. In no time, television became not only the town square for news, but a reflector of dreams and preferences across diverse aspects of life. Literally everything in an individual’s life revolved around the content disseminated through the television with movies, comics and film shows being the major catalysts of this shift. This occurrence intersected with the existent consumption society and gave rise to a common standard of lifestyle desired by the masses, known as popular (pop) culture.\n\nFor organizations, product homogeneity wasn’t enough to thrive; brand design, identity and reach became more significant than ever. Coupled with the advent of a new mass media technology, the market evolved to become open. New organizations debuted the scene and competition for consumers’ attention went fierce.

{"id": "yC9W_48zGQMXoaFE-23UojuHfnjXLzzGpPmD264h6B8", "title": "Positioning Crypto Cities", "body": "Growing interest in applications of blockchain technology in city planning has sparked a drum roll of city tokens, city DAOs, decentralised city projects, city white-papers and city dreams. Vitalik Buterin’s blog post [Crypto Cities](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/10/31/cities.html) collates some of these. Instead of adding to or reviewing the expanding list of projects, I want to contribute some themes and concepts from urban theory that can help position and frame the possibilities.\n\nSocial scientists, economists, geographers, historians, designers (etc) have amassed a weight of concepts for theorising collective understandings of the city. These concepts can anchor the abundant Web 3 project work, and offer pathways for talking about crypto cities ideas in ways that make sense in both blockchain and urban planning language.  \n  \n Four vectors of city themes that are useful in anchoring crypto cities are: \n\n* city identity\n* city lifecycle\n* city ownership\n* city governance\n\n## 1. City identity\n\n City identity has historically suffered a problem / saviour complex. On one hand, cities are seen as the world’s dustbin where wicked problems concentrate, *dumping grounds for globally conceived and gestated problems* \\[1\\]. On the other hand, they are laboratories of creation.  \n  \n Popular social science’s OTT glorification of cities in the 2010s \\[eg. 2+3\\] was sparked, in part, by ideas about *the strength of weak ties*, applying the famous paper \\[4\\] to LinkedIn visions of productivity and innovation. Innovation happens, goes the wisdom, because diverse people, ideas and disciplines are brought close together through agglomeration, clustering, collaboration.  \n  \n *Grand city experiments* are leading characters in western history. There is the city designed around health (garden cities), around efficiency (modernist cities), around trade and economics (medieval city states, or economic hub cities). Then there are optimistic ideas of the age-friendly city, the child-friendly city, the sustainable city, the creative city, a city for people, smart cities... \n  \n These mono-thematic identities are of course all deficient, even if well-meaning, adoptions of the obsession of the moment. \n\n### Key takeaway from city theory: pursue multiple overlapping visions.\n\n## 2. City life-cycle\n\n Cities exist in a perpetual life cycle. Growth, decay, uncertainty, change, replacement, renewal are the daily and decade rhythms of urbanity. It is extraordinary how complex assemblages of materiality, infrastructure, networks and humans can shift, fracture and layer in response to unique local geographies, regional economies and industries, and big global forces such as economic deregulation and migration. \n  \n As the world faces the immense global force of the climate crisis, we have to hope that our cities will become more resilient. Sustainability goals and the impacts of climate change are being addressed at the city level around the world - through waste strategies, flood protection, walkability metrics, greening, community infrastructure, and community engagement. \n\nUrban histories evidence simultaneously the city’s solid endurance and liquid delicacy. Cities are *antifragile* \\[5\\] - they tend to get stronger (and more interesting) through their continual friction and change.\n\n### Key takeaway from city theory: plan for change not immutability.\n\n## 3. City ownership\n\nCity assets (land, housing, buildings, transport, utilities, community infrastructure) are material, fixed, long-lasting, and expensive. Most are ‘owned’ collectively, albeit through overlapping claims and operation rights by both individuals and global consortia. Individual property ownership is part of a society’s political economy. For example, policy supporting private housing ownership has benefits for the individual, while also generating stability for labour markets, a form of retirement income insurance for state welfare budgets, and macro-economic levers. \n\nAn ideology of individualism, personal choice and responsibility, small government and privatisation of services is a substrate of the current era, and this institutionalised individualism standardises relations, transactions and ownership. Overlay here concepts like the *right to the city* \\[6\\], which elevate co-created space, free of commodified ‘pay to play’ expectations. Balancing *who pays* and *who benefits* between the individual and the collective is the imperfect and often unequal task of planning.\n\n### Key takeaway from city theory: asset ownership is part of the structures of society.\n\n## 4. City governance\n\nAs for determining *who decides*, this is also the task of planning. The historical culture of planning is rooted in enlightenment ideas that scientific knowledge will provide objective basis for identifying needs and solutions. By the end of the 1960s, researchers came to a different view; negotiation and interpretation were essential dimensions of *advocacy and pluralism in planning* \\[7\\]. \n\nA *collaborative planning* approach \\[for eg. 8\\] is the realisation that knowledge and value are not objective but are actively constructed through social and interactive processes. Through collaborative planning, *participants build new systems of meaning, new cultures, new organising routines and styles and new social networks* (p.285). The challenge is that, although the theory is sound, collaborative planning in practice is hard.\n\n### Key takeaway from city theory: successful collaborative decision-making is the city planning holy grail.\n\n\\*  \\*  \\*\n\nWhile these four themes barely skim the surface of the depth of city theory, the key takeaways (multiple visions, change and resilience, a layered view of ownership, appetite for collaborative planning) can help connect between Web 3 and Trad city planning language to describe goals and mechanisms of decentralisation, networks, transparency, access, accountability, coordination.\n\nCity-shaping is slow, risk averse and involves many hands. This is an exceptionally challenging space to seek to imbricate a new paradigm of decentralised and/or autonomous ownership or decision-making. It is also a space that, for the same reasons, could benefit from it.\n\n\\*  \\*  \\*\n\n\\[1\\] Zygmunt Bauman, 2007, ﻿*Liquid Times: Living in and Age of Uncertainty*, Polity.\n\n\\[2\\] Edward L Glaeser, 2011, *Triumph of the City: How Our Greatest Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, Greener, Healthier, and Happier*, Penguin.\n\n\\[3\\] Richard Florida, 2009, *Who's Your City?: How the Creative Economy Is Making Where to Live the Most Important Decision of Your Life*, Basic Books.\n\n\\[4\\] Mark Granovetter, 1973, ‘The Strength of Weak Ties’, *American Journal of Sociology*, Vol. 78:4.\n\n\\[5\\] Nassim Nicholas Taleb, 2013, *Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder*, Penguin. \n\n\\[6\\] Originally defined by Henri Lefebvre, 1968, *Le Droit à la Ville*.

The community airdrop program will distribute 502,110 ZLK, and it consists of several parts, below we will detail who will be eligible for the ZLK airdrop.\n\n## Zenlink Early Event Participant (total 19,253 ZLK)\n\nOver the past year, Zenlink has hosted many community events, including the AMA giveaway, Cooperation giveaway, Community Idea Contest, Community Carnival, etc. If you were one of the participants, then you were awarded a certain number of ZLK tokens according to the rules announced at the time.\n\nYou can check whether you are on the list of winners of the corresponding activities here: <https://wiki.zenlink.pro/ecosystem/token-distribution>\n\nThe rules of the rewards for the above activities have all been announced prior to the start of the event, so all rewards will be awarded in accordance with the rules.\n\n## Zenlink beta test participants (total 196,855 ZLK)\n\nZenlink beta test participants are divided into two parts: Zenlink 1st public test participants and Zenlink 2nd beta test participants.\n\n## Zenlink 1st public test participants (total 158,855 ZLK)\n\nAnother eligible airdrop is for participants of the Zenlink 1st public test. Previously, we have announced the rules of rewards before launching the 1st public test, according to which Top Winners and Bug Bounty winners will receive Zenlink NFT ( Explorer Edition ) or a certain number of ZLK tokens respectively.\n\nThe answer to how many ZLK tokens the Zenlink NFT ( Explorer Edition ) will be airdropped is available today, the Zenlink NFT ( Explorer Edition ) holder will receive 200 ZLK tokens airdropped. We have previously obtained the binding between your Substrate address and your EVM address by verifying the signature process, so you don’t have to do anything but wait for the airdrop to be sent to your address.\n\nIn the meantime, as an expression of our appreciation to early testers, we still have a broader airdrop program. **All addresses that have participated in DEX interactions (Request testcoins from faucet, Swap, Add/Remove liquidity) in the 1st public test will receive a share of 115,595 ZLK based on the percentage of points earned (14,149 addresses are eligible, excluding those that have received Zenlink NFT).**\n\n## Zenlink 2nd beta test participants (total 38,000 ZLK)\n\nSimilarly, participants of the Zenlink 2nd beta test will also receive an airdrop of ZLK tokens. Since the 2nd beta test is a non-public test, only addresses that are on the whitelist will receive the airdrop. We will airdrop 1 Zenlink NFT ( Explorer Edition) for all addresses on the whitelist, which covers the airdrop entitlement of 200 ZLK (190 addresses in total are eligible).\n\n## Zenlink SlotVault participants (total 267,216 ZLK)\n\nAs a participant deeply involved in the development of Polkadot ecosystem, we have been following the development of major milestones such as PLO and built Zenlink SlotVault. SlotVault is a decentralized PLO support application built by Zenlink, which is designed to provide support for Zenlink partners to bid for parachain slots. Users who participate in PLO through SlotVault will receive dual token incentives from parachain projects and Zenlink.\n\nSince the launch of Zenlink SlotVault, it has been widely supported by the community and has provided strong support for our partners, such as Calamari, Altair, Kintsugi BTC, etc. Therefore, all community users who vote for the above three projects through Zenlink SlotVault will get a certain number of ZLK tokens airdropped in accordance with the rules.\n\nSince Zenlink SlotVault offers different rewards for each parachain partner, according to the rules, we will provide additional ZLK incentives to Calamari, Altair, and Kintsugi BTC as follows:\n\n*   Calamari Network：150,000 ZLK\n*   Altair：74,928 ZLK\n*   Kintsugi BTC：42,278 ZLK\n\nYou can connect your wallet in Zenlink SlotVault to see how many ZLK tokens you will receive. Only addresses that contribute to the parachain crowdloan through Zenlink SlotVault will receive the ZLK token airdrop.\n\n**Note:** 50% of the ZLK airdrop in this section will be sent immediately after the Zenlink DEX DApp is launched, and the remaining 50% will be unlocked and sent after you achieve a trading volume ≥ 1000 USD or liquidity injection ≥ 5000 USD in the first month of the Zenlink DEX DApp launch, which will be sent after one month from the Zenlink DEX DApp launch date.\n\n## Zenlink NFT (Guardian Edition) Holders (total 18,786 ZLK)\n\nAt the same time, we also have some airdrops reserved for our community contributors, who are also future Zenlink NFT (Guardian Edition) holders, whose main roles in the Zenlink ecology are members of the ZenlinkDAO Initial Governance Committee and Zenlink Guardians / Community Ambassadors, whose incentives will be evaluated and rewarded by the Zenlink Foundation based on their contributions.\n\nIt should be noted that this portion of the reward is not the final reward for members of the ZenlinkDAO initial Governance Committee and Zenlink Guardian / Community Ambassadors, but only for the airdrop rights attached to Zenlink NFT (Guardian Edition).\n\nFor all the above rewards, users can go to the “ZLK” interface in [Zenlink DEX](https://dex.zenlink.pro/#/zlk) after the launch of Zenlink DEX DApp and click “search your airdrops” in the upper right corner to see if you meet the criteria and how many ZLK tokens you will receive. The rewards are still being sent out and are expected to be paid out on November 6, 2021, at which time users can follow the process described above to check for airdrops.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*2KyPiWoxLQQCDNVkiFGcqQ.png)\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: Which chain does the ZLK airdrop or reward I am about to receive belong to? What do I need to prepare to get it?**\n\nA: **All the ZLK airdrops or rewards mentioned above belong to the ZLK issued on the Bifrost parachain.** You need to install Polkadot.js and import a qualified account (if you have completed this step, you can skip it directly) to receive the airdrop.\n\n**Q: How to check if I am eligible for the airdrop and the amount of ZLK I can get?**\n\nA: For all the ZLK airdrops or rewards mentioned above, users can go to the “ZLK” interface in Zenlink DEX after Zenlink DEX DApp is launched and click “search your airdrop” in the upper right corner to enter the Substrate address to see if you meet the criteria and how many ZLK tokens you will get.\n\nIt should be noted that when we collected user addresses before, we collected addresses in various formats, including Polkadot Relay Chain / Kusama Relay Chain / Substrate. You can enter addresses in any format to search airdrop rewards. The number of airdrops shown by all addresses in the same address is actually the same airdrop, and it is not superimposed.\n\n**Q: How will the airdrop reward be distributed? Do you follow the same unlocking rules?**\n\nA: Since all of the above airdrops or rewards belong to the ZLK issued on the Bifrost chain, ZLK airdrops will eventually be sent to your Bifrost wallet address (switch the address displayed to “Bifrost” in the Polkadot.js extension), which is unsolicited and does not require you to collect it manually.\n\nThe above airdrops or rewards will apply to the following unlocked rules: Airdrops for Zenlink SlotVault participants will receive 50% of the airdrop immediately after Zenlink DEX DApp is launched, the remaining 50% will be unlocked and sent after you achieve a trading volume ≥ 1000 USD or liquidity injection ≥ 5000 USD in the first month of the Zenlink DEX DApp launch, which will be sent after one month from the Zenlink DEX DApp launch date. The rest of the early backer airdrops will be airdropped to the corresponding accounts as soon as the Zenlink DEX DApp goes live.\n\n**Q: When will the Zenlink NFT (Explorer Edition) belonging to Zenlink’s second round of Beta testers and the Zenlink NFT (Guardian Edition) of Zenlink DAO Initial governance committee members and Zenlink guardians/ambassadors be released? Are there any plans for Zenlink NFT?**\n\nA: The above-mentioned Zenlink NFT is not released for the time being, but only records the attribution, it will be sent out on the Polkadot network at a later date.\n\nThis is because Zenlink NFT is currently issued on BSC but not in circulation, we plan to map Zenlink NFT to the Polkadot network in the future, and we will also issue a separate economic whitepaper describing the design and future development plans of Zenlink NFT.\n\n**Learn more about Zenlink:**\n\n📍 — DEX | [Website](https://zenlink.pro/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zenlinkpro)| [Github](https://github.com/zenlinkpro/) | [Telegram EN](https://t.me/ZenlinkPro_EN) | [Telegram CN](https://t.me/ZenlinkPro_CN) | [Announcements Channel](https://t.me/ZenlinkPro_ann)\n\n📚 — [Whitepaper](https://github.com/zenlinkpro/whitepaper) | [Tokenomics](https://wiki.zenlink.pro/resources/tokenomics)\n", "timestamp": 1636255539, "digest": "RR9t067X1X9qc0Bwvp7kMVCKaEQt9tqOqXSmoBTnJsY", "contributor": "0x8f32844357f27d8C185255832B914dd7E3eCFB9a"}

The community airdrop program will distribute 502,110 ZLK, and it consists of several parts, below we will detail who will be eligible for the ZLK airdrop.\n\n## Zenlink Early Event Participant (total 19,253 ZLK)\n\nOver the past year, Zenlink has hosted many community events, including the AMA giveaway, Cooperation giveaway, Community Idea Contest, Community Carnival, etc. If you were one of the participants, then you were awarded a certain number of ZLK tokens according to the rules announced at the time.\n\nYou can check whether you are on the list of winners of the corresponding activities here: <https://wiki.zenlink.pro/ecosystem/token-distribution>\n\nThe rules of the rewards for the above activities have all been announced prior to the start of the event, so all rewards will be awarded in accordance with the rules.\n\n## Zenlink beta test participants (total 196,855 ZLK)\n\nZenlink beta test participants are divided into two parts: Zenlink 1st public test participants and Zenlink 2nd beta test participants.\n\n## Zenlink 1st public test participants (total 158,855 ZLK)\n\nAnother eligible airdrop is for participants of the Zenlink 1st public test. Previously, we have announced the rules of rewards before launching the 1st public test, according to which Top Winners and Bug Bounty winners will receive Zenlink NFT ( Explorer Edition ) or a certain number of ZLK tokens respectively.\n\nThe answer to how many ZLK tokens the Zenlink NFT ( Explorer Edition ) will be airdropped is available today, the Zenlink NFT ( Explorer Edition ) holder will receive 200 ZLK tokens airdropped. We have previously obtained the binding between your Substrate address and your EVM address by verifying the signature process, so you don’t have to do anything but wait for the airdrop to be sent to your address.\n\nIn the meantime, as an expression of our appreciation to early testers, we still have a broader airdrop program. **All addresses that have participated in DEX interactions (Request testcoins from faucet, Swap, Add/Remove liquidity) in the 1st public test will receive a share of 115,595 ZLK based on the percentage of points earned (14,149 addresses are eligible, excluding those that have received Zenlink NFT).**\n\n## Zenlink 2nd beta test participants (total 38,000 ZLK)\n\nSimilarly, participants of the Zenlink 2nd beta test will also receive an airdrop of ZLK tokens. Since the 2nd beta test is a non-public test, only addresses that are on the whitelist will receive the airdrop. We will airdrop 1 Zenlink NFT ( Explorer Edition) for all addresses on the whitelist, which covers the airdrop entitlement of 200 ZLK (190 addresses in total are eligible).\n\n## Zenlink SlotVault participants (total 267,216 ZLK)\n\nAs a participant deeply involved in the development of Polkadot ecosystem, we have been following the development of major milestones such as PLO and built Zenlink SlotVault. SlotVault is a decentralized PLO support application built by Zenlink, which is designed to provide support for Zenlink partners to bid for parachain slots. Users who participate in PLO through SlotVault will receive dual token incentives from parachain projects and Zenlink.\n\nSince the launch of Zenlink SlotVault, it has been widely supported by the community and has provided strong support for our partners, such as Calamari, Altair, Kintsugi BTC, etc. Therefore, all community users who vote for the above three projects through Zenlink SlotVault will get a certain number of ZLK tokens airdropped in accordance with the rules.\n\nSince Zenlink SlotVault offers different rewards for each parachain partner, according to the rules, we will provide additional ZLK incentives to Calamari, Altair, and Kintsugi BTC as follows:\n\n*   Calamari Network：150,000 ZLK\n*   Altair：74,928 ZLK\n*   Kintsugi BTC：42,278 ZLK\n\nYou can connect your wallet in Zenlink SlotVault to see how many ZLK tokens you will receive. Only addresses that contribute to the parachain crowdloan through Zenlink SlotVault will receive the ZLK token airdrop.\n\n**Note:** 50% of the ZLK airdrop in this section will be sent immediately after the Zenlink DEX DApp is launched, and the remaining 50% will be unlocked and sent after you achieve a trading volume ≥ 1000 USD or liquidity injection ≥ 5000 USD in the first month of the Zenlink DEX DApp launch, which will be sent after one month from the Zenlink DEX DApp launch date.\n\n## Zenlink NFT (Guardian Edition) Holders (total 18,786 ZLK)\n\nAt the same time, we also have some airdrops reserved for our community contributors, who are also future Zenlink NFT (Guardian Edition) holders, whose main roles in the Zenlink ecology are members of the ZenlinkDAO Initial Governance Committee and Zenlink Guardians / Community Ambassadors, whose incentives will be evaluated and rewarded by the Zenlink Foundation based on their contributions.\n\nIt should be noted that this portion of the reward is not the final reward for members of the ZenlinkDAO initial Governance Committee and Zenlink Guardian / Community Ambassadors, but only for the airdrop rights attached to Zenlink NFT (Guardian Edition).\n\nFor all the above rewards, users can go to the “ZLK” interface in [Zenlink DEX](https://dex.zenlink.pro/#/zlk) after the launch of Zenlink DEX DApp and click “search your airdrops” in the upper right corner to see if you meet the criteria and how many ZLK tokens you will receive. The rewards are still being sent out and are expected to be paid out on November 6, 2021, at which time users can follow the process described above to check for airdrops.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*2KyPiWoxLQQCDNVkiFGcqQ.png)\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: Which chain does the ZLK airdrop or reward I am about to receive belong to? What do I need to prepare to get it?**\n\nA: **All the ZLK airdrops or rewards mentioned above belong to the ZLK issued on the Bifrost parachain.** You need to install Polkadot.js and import a qualified account (if you have completed this step, you can skip it directly) to receive the airdrop.\n\n**Q: How to check if I am eligible for the airdrop and the amount of ZLK I can get?**\n\nA: For all the ZLK airdrops or rewards mentioned above, users can go to the “ZLK” interface in Zenlink DEX after Zenlink DEX DApp is launched and click “search your airdrop” in the upper right corner to enter the Substrate address to see if you meet the criteria and how many ZLK tokens you will get.\n\nIt should be noted that when we collected user addresses before, we collected addresses in various formats, including Polkadot Relay Chain / Kusama Relay Chain / Substrate. You can enter addresses in any format to search airdrop rewards. The number of airdrops shown by all addresses in the same address is actually the same airdrop, and it is not superimposed.\n\n**Q: How will the airdrop reward be distributed? Do you follow the same unlocking rules?**\n\nA: Since all of the above airdrops or rewards belong to the ZLK issued on the Bifrost chain, ZLK airdrops will eventually be sent to your Bifrost wallet address (switch the address displayed to “Bifrost” in the Polkadot.js extension), which is unsolicited and does not require you to collect it manually.\n\nThe above airdrops or rewards will apply to the following unlocked rules: Airdrops for Zenlink SlotVault participants will receive 50% of the airdrop immediately after Zenlink DEX DApp is launched, the remaining 50% will be unlocked and sent after you achieve a trading volume ≥ 1000 USD or liquidity injection ≥ 5000 USD in the first month of the Zenlink DEX DApp launch, which will be sent after one month from the Zenlink DEX DApp launch date. The rest of the early backer airdrops will be airdropped to the corresponding accounts as soon as the Zenlink DEX DApp goes live.\n\n**Q: When will the Zenlink NFT (Explorer Edition) belonging to Zenlink’s second round of Beta testers and the Zenlink NFT (Guardian Edition) of Zenlink DAO Initial governance committee members and Zenlink guardians/ambassadors be released? Are there any plans for Zenlink NFT?**\n\nA: The above-mentioned Zenlink NFT is not released for the time being, but only records the attribution, it will be sent out on the Polkadot network at a later date.\n\nThis is because Zenlink NFT is currently issued on BSC but not in circulation, we plan to map Zenlink NFT to the Polkadot network in the future, and we will also issue a separate economic whitepaper describing the design and future development plans of Zenlink NFT.\n\n**Learn more about Zenlink:**\n\n📍 — DEX | [Website](https://zenlink.pro/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zenlinkpro)| [Github](https://github.com/zenlinkpro/) | [Telegram EN](https://t.me/ZenlinkPro_EN) | [Telegram CN](https://t.me/ZenlinkPro_CN) | [Announcements Channel](https://t.me/ZenlinkPro_ann)\n\n📚 — [Whitepaper](https://github.com/zenlinkpro/whitepaper) | [Tokenomics](https://wiki.zenlink.pro/resources/tokenomics)\n", "timestamp": 1636255566, "digest": "6S0PfKjh2NNUHWOO6BqnKEn8J9TXFN1g40DOvgKJCc4", "contributor": "0xbd52c13827f012797005F57E4dB3b8db155580F2"}

Vitalik Buterin’s blog post [Crypto Cities](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/10/31/cities.html) collates some of these. Instead of adding to or reviewing the expanding list of projects, I want to contribute some themes and concepts from urban theory that can help position and frame the possibilities.\n\nSocial scientists, economists, geographers, historians, designers (etc) have amassed a weight of concepts for theorising collective understandings of the city. These concepts can anchor the abundant Web 3 project work, and offer pathways for talking about crypto cities ideas in ways that make sense in both blockchain and urban planning language.  \n  \n Four vectors of city themes that are useful in anchoring crypto cities are: \n\n* city identity\n* city lifecycle\n* city ownership\n* city governance\n\n## 1. City identity\n\n City identity has historically suffered a problem / saviour complex. On one hand, cities are seen as the world’s dustbin where wicked problems concentrate, *dumping grounds for globally conceived and gestated problems* \\[1\\]. On the other hand, they are laboratories of creation.  \n  \n Popular social science’s OTT glorification of cities in the 2010s \\[eg. 2+3\\] was sparked, in part, by ideas about *the strength of weak ties*, applying the famous paper \\[4\\] to LinkedIn visions of productivity and innovation. Innovation happens, goes the wisdom, because diverse people, ideas and disciplines are brought close together through agglomeration, clustering, collaboration.  \n  \n *Grand city experiments* are leading characters in western history. There is the city designed around health (garden cities), around efficiency (modernist cities), around trade and economics (medieval city states, or economic hub cities). Then there are optimistic ideas of the age-friendly city, the child-friendly city, the sustainable city, the creative city, a city for people, smart cities... \n  \n These mono-thematic identities are of course all deficient, even if well-meaning, adoptions of the obsession of the moment. \n\n### Key takeaway from city theory: pursue multiple overlapping visions.\n\n## 2. City life-cycle\n\n Cities exist in a perpetual life cycle. Growth, decay, uncertainty, change, replacement, renewal are the daily and decade rhythms of urbanity. It is extraordinary how complex assemblages of materiality, infrastructure, networks and humans can shift, fracture and layer in response to unique local geographies, regional economies and industries, and big global forces such as economic deregulation and migration. \n  \n As the world faces the immense global force of the climate crisis, we have to hope that our cities will become more resilient. Sustainability goals and the impacts of climate change are being addressed at the city level around the world - through waste strategies, flood protection, walkability metrics, greening, community infrastructure, and community engagement. \n\nUrban histories evidence simultaneously the city’s solid endurance and liquid delicacy. Cities are *antifragile* \\[5\\] - they tend to get stronger (and more interesting) through their continual friction and change.\n\n### Key takeaway from city theory: plan for change not immutability.\n\n## 3. City ownership\n\nCity assets (land, housing, buildings, transport, utilities, community infrastructure) are material, fixed, long-lasting, and expensive. Most are ‘owned’ collectively, albeit through overlapping claims and operation rights by both individuals and global consortia. Individual property ownership is part of a society’s political economy. For example, policy supporting private housing ownership has benefits for the individual, while also generating stability for labour markets, a form of retirement income insurance for state welfare budgets, and macro-economic levers. \n\nAn ideology of individualism, personal choice and responsibility, small government and privatisation of services is a substrate of the current era, and this institutionalised individualism standardises relations, transactions and ownership. Overlay here concepts like the *right to the city* \\[6\\], which elevate co-created space, free of commodified ‘pay to play’ expectations. Balancing *who pays* and *who benefits* between the individual and the collective is the imperfect and often unequal task of planning.\n\n### Key takeaway from city theory: asset ownership is part of the structures of society.\n\n## 4. City governance\n\nAs for determining *who decides*, this is also the task of planning. The historical culture of planning is rooted in enlightenment ideas that scientific knowledge will provide objective basis for identifying needs and solutions. By the end of the 1960s, researchers came to a different view; negotiation and interpretation were essential dimensions of *advocacy and pluralism in planning* \\[7\\]. \n\nA *collaborative planning* approach \\[for eg. 8\\] is the realisation that knowledge and value are not objective but are actively constructed through social and interactive processes. Through collaborative planning, *participants build new systems of meaning, new cultures, new organising routines and styles and new social networks* (p.285). The challenge is that, although the theory is sound, collaborative planning in practice is hard.\n\n### Key takeaway from city theory: successful collaborative decision-making is the city planning holy grail.\n\n\\*  \\*  \\*\n\nWhile these four themes barely skim the surface of the depth of city theory, the key takeaways (multiple visions, change and resilience, a layered view of ownership, appetite for collaborative planning) can help connect between Web 3 and Trad city planning language to describe goals and mechanisms of decentralisation, networks, transparency, access, accountability, coordination.\n\nCity-shaping is slow, risk averse and involves many hands. This is an exceptionally challenging space to seek to imbricate a new paradigm of decentralised and/or autonomous ownership or decision-making. It is also a space that, for the same reasons, could benefit from it.\n\n\\*  \\*  \\*\n\n\\[1\\] Zygmunt Bauman, 2007, ﻿*Liquid Times: Living in and Age of Uncertainty*, Polity.\n\n\\[2\\] Edward L Glaeser, 2011, *Triumph of the City: How Our Greatest Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, Greener, Healthier, and Happier*, Penguin.\n\n\\[3\\] Richard Florida, 2009, *Who's Your City?: How the Creative Economy Is Making Where to Live the Most Important Decision of Your Life*, Basic Books.\n\n\\[4\\] Mark Granovetter, 1973, ‘The Strength of Weak Ties’, *American Journal of Sociology*, Vol. 78:4.\n\n\\[5\\] Nassim Nicholas Taleb, 2013, *Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder*, Penguin. \n\n\\[6\\] Originally defined by Henri Lefebvre, 1968, *Le Droit à la Ville*.

City governance\n\nAs for determining *who decides*, this is also the task of planning. The historical culture of planning is rooted in enlightenment ideas that scientific knowledge will provide objective basis for identifying needs and solutions. By the end of the 1960s, researchers came to a different view; negotiation and interpretation were essential dimensions of *advocacy and pluralism in planning* \\[7\\].\n\nA *collaborative planning* approach \\[for eg. 8\\] is the realisation that knowledge and value are not objective but are actively constructed through social and interactive processes. Through collaborative planning, *participants build new systems of meaning, new cultures, new organising routines and styles and new social networks* (p.285). The challenge is that, although the theory is sound, collaborative planning in practice is hard.\n\n### Key takeaway from city theory: successful collaborative decision-making is the city planning holy grail.\n\n\\*  \\*  \\*\n\nWhile these four themes barely skim the surface of the depth of city theory, the key takeaways (multiple visions, change and resilience, a layered view of ownership, appetite for collaborative planning) can help connect between Web 3 and Trad city planning language to describe goals and mechanisms of decentralisation, networks, transparency, access, accountability, coordination.\n\nCity-shaping is slow, risk averse and involves many hands. This is an exceptionally challenging space to seek to imbricate a new paradigm of decentralised and/or autonomous ownership or decision-making. It is also a space that, for the same reasons, could benefit from it.\n\n\\*  \\*  \\*\n\n\\[1\\] Zygmunt Bauman, 2007, ﻿*Liquid Times: Living in and Age of Uncertainty*, Polity.\n\n\\[2\\] Edward L Glaeser, 2011, *Triumph of the City: How Our Greatest Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, Greener, Healthier, and Happier*, Penguin.\n\n\\[3\\] Richard Florida, 2009, *Who's Your City?: How the Creative Economy Is Making Where to Live the Most Important Decision of Your Life*, Basic Books.\n\n\\[4\\] Mark Granovetter, 1973, ‘The Strength of Weak Ties’, *American Journal of Sociology*, Vol. 78:4.\n\n\\[5\\] Nassim Nicholas Taleb, 2013, *Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder*, Penguin.\n\n\\[6\\] Originally defined by Henri Lefebvre, 1968, *Le Droit à la Ville*.

Vitalik Buterin’s blog post [Crypto Cities](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/10/31/cities.html) collates some of these. Instead of adding to or reviewing the expanding list of projects, I want to contribute some themes and concepts from urban theory that can help position and frame the possibilities.\n\nSocial scientists, economists, geographers, historians, designers (etc) have amassed a weight of concepts for theorising collective understandings of the city. These concepts can anchor the abundant Web 3 project work, and offer pathways for talking about crypto cities ideas in ways that make sense in both blockchain and urban planning language.\n\nFour vectors of city themes that are useful in anchoring crypto cities are:\n\n* city identity\n* city lifecycle\n* city ownership\n* city governance\n\n## 1. City identity\n\nCity identity has historically suffered a problem / saviour complex. On one hand, cities are seen as the world’s dustbin where wicked problems concentrate, *dumping grounds for globally conceived and gestated problems* \\[1\\]. On the other hand, they are laboratories of creation.\n\nPopular social science’s OTT glorification of cities in the 2010s \\[eg. 2+3\\] was sparked, in part, by ideas about *the strength of weak ties*, applying the famous paper \\[4\\] to LinkedIn visions of productivity and innovation. Innovation happens, goes the wisdom, because diverse people, ideas and disciplines are brought close together through agglomeration, clustering, collaboration.\n\n*Grand city experiments* are leading characters in western history.

They have been trapped in the broken Mirror World since the first day of memory, a data island imprisoned their steps, they have helplessly looked up to the sky, but the world has never descended on their salvation.\n\nOur name is the Mirror crew, people who are at the forefront of the times.\n\nBorn in the ruins of the scorched earth, we are the watchers of the old times left behind by the world.\n\nI am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the web.\n\nI am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn.\n\nI pledge my life and honor to the Mirror World, for this night and all the nights to come。\n\nIn the coming period, we will continue to share the latest discoveries about our exploration of the Mirror World.\n\nStay tuned to get the latest news.", "timestamp": 1636258997, "digest": "aDNr3Q3cNhUl_17aJW0HAImxxGS0X7HHPFiJe1IteL8", "contributor": "0x5216925c8835637b4fBDaC915b7Ff46F560393B5"}

Instead of adding to or reviewing the expanding list of projects, I want to contribute some themes and concepts from urban theory that can help position and frame the possibilities.\n\nSocial scientists, economists, geographers, historians, designers (etc) have amassed a weight of concepts for theorising collective understandings of the city. These concepts can anchor the abundant Web 3 project work, and offer pathways for talking about crypto cities ideas in ways that make sense in both blockchain and urban planning language.\n\nFour vectors of city themes that are useful in anchoring crypto cities are:\n\n* city identity\n* city lifecycle\n* city ownership\n* city governance\n\n## 1. City identity\n\nCity identity has historically suffered a problem / saviour complex. On one hand, cities are seen as the world’s dustbin where wicked problems concentrate, *dumping grounds for globally conceived and gestated problems* \\[1\\]. On the other hand, they are laboratories of creation.\n\nPopular social science’s OTT glorification of cities in the 2010s \\[eg. 2+3\\] was sparked, in part, by ideas about *the strength of weak ties*, applying the famous paper \\[4\\] to LinkedIn visions of productivity and innovation. Innovation happens, goes the wisdom, because diverse people, ideas and disciplines are brought close together through agglomeration, clustering, collaboration.\n\n*Grand city experiments* are leading characters in western history. There is the city designed around health (garden cities), around efficiency (modernist cities), around trade and economics (medieval city states, or economic hub cities). Then there are optimistic ideas of the age-friendly city, the child-friendly city, the sustainable city, the creative city, a city for people, smart cities...\n\nThese mono-thematic identities are of course all deficient, even if well-meaning, adoptions of the obsession of the moment.\n\n### Key takeaway from city theory: pursue multiple overlapping visions.\n\n## 2. City life-cycle\n\nCities exist in a perpetual life cycle. Growth, decay, uncertainty, change, replacement, renewal are the daily and decade rhythms of urbanity. It is extraordinary how complex assemblages of materiality, infrastructure, networks and humans can shift, fracture and layer in response to unique local geographies, regional economies and industries, and big global forces such as economic deregulation and migration.\n\nAs the world faces the immense global force of the climate crisis, we have to hope that our cities will become more resilient. Sustainability goals and the impacts of climate change are being addressed at the city level around the world - through waste strategies, flood protection, walkability metrics, greening, community infrastructure, and community engagement.\n\nUrban histories evidence simultaneously the city’s solid endurance and liquid delicacy. Cities are *antifragile* \\[5\\] - they tend to get stronger (and more interesting) through their continual friction and change.\n\n### Key takeaway from city theory: plan for change not immutability.\n\n## 3. City ownership\n\nCity assets (land, housing, buildings, transport, utilities, community infrastructure) are material, fixed, long-lasting, and expensive. Most are ‘owned’ collectively, albeit through overlapping claims and operation rights by both individuals and global consortia. Individual property ownership is part of a society’s political economy. For example, policy supporting private housing ownership has benefits for the individual, while also generating stability for labour markets, a form of retirement income insurance for state welfare budgets, and macro-economic levers.\n\nAn ideology of individualism, personal choice and responsibility, small government and privatisation of services is a substrate of the current era, and this institutionalised individualism standardises relations, transactions and ownership. Overlay here concepts like the *right to the city* \\[6\\], which elevate co-created space, free of commodified ‘pay to play’ expectations. Balancing *who pays* and *who benefits* between the individual and the collective is the imperfect and often unequal task of planning.\n\n### Key takeaway from city theory: asset ownership is part of the structures of society.\n\n## 4. City governance\n\nAs for determining *who decides*, this is also the task of planning. The historical culture of planning is rooted in enlightenment ideas that scientific knowledge will provide objective basis for identifying needs and solutions. By the end of the 1960s, researchers came to a different view; negotiation and interpretation were essential dimensions of *advocacy and pluralism in planning* \\[7\\].\n\nA *collaborative planning* approach \\[for eg. 8\\] is the realisation that knowledge and value are not objective but are actively constructed through social and interactive processes. Through collaborative planning, *participants build new systems of meaning, new cultures, new organising routines and styles and new social networks* (p.285). The challenge is that, although the theory is sound, collaborative planning in practice is hard.\n\n### Key takeaway from city theory: successful collaborative decision-making is the city planning holy grail.\n\n \n \\*  \\*  \\*\n\nWhile these four themes barely skim the surface of the depth of city theory, the key takeaways (multiple visions, change and resilience, a layered view of ownership, appetite for collaborative planning) can help connect between Web 3 and Trad city planning language to describe goals and mechanisms of decentralisation, networks, transparency, access, accountability, coordination.\n\nCity-shaping is slow, risk averse and involves many hands. This is an exceptionally challenging space to seek to imbricate a new paradigm of decentralised and/or autonomous ownership or decision-making. It is also a space that, for the same reasons, could benefit from it.\n\n\\*  \\*  \\*\n\n\\[1\\] Zygmunt Bauman, 2007, ﻿*Liquid Times: Living in and Age of Uncertainty*, Polity.\n\n\\[2\\] Edward L Glaeser, 2011, *Triumph of the City: How Our Greatest Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, Greener, Healthier, and Happier*, Penguin.\n\n\\[3\\] Richard Florida, 2009, *Who's Your City?: How the Creative Economy Is Making Where to Live the Most Important Decision of Your Life*, Basic Books.\n\n\\[4\\] Mark Granovetter, 1973, ‘The Strength of Weak Ties’, *American Journal of Sociology*, Vol. 78:4.\n\n\\[5\\] Nassim Nicholas Taleb, 2013, *Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder*, Penguin.\n\n\\[6\\] Originally defined by Henri Lefebvre, 1968, *Le Droit à la Ville*.

But now, Web 2.0 has become a cage holding the birds in flight.\n\nPeople are becoming numb. When you wake up every day, you see only what the “lords” want you to see; when you get ready to sleep, you close your eyes and say, “It doesn’t seem so bad. You are told what to wear, what to eat, what videos to watch, how to live, and gradually lose your right to know, your right to privacy, your right to expression, and even your property right.\n\nStop lying to yourself! You’ve known for a long time that Web 2.0 has devastating problems. the point of the Web was to allow data to be shared and for everyone to champion their values. But 2.0 has become increasingly counterproductive to that goal.\n\nThe large corporations usually slyly argue how much they have contributed to the Internet, touting better services for people and trumpeting resolutions that have changed the world. But what about the reality? They spend most of their efforts studying how to break the competition, they do not care whether their services are good, as long as they are better than their competitors. One day, when they emerge victorious from the battle, they immediately tear off their hypocrisy and reveal the true nature of “ monopoly “. The Web 2.0 company is a capital company, and making money is their priority.\n\nLet’s take the example of the video-sharing and social media platform that people are most familiar with, yes, the one that starts with a Y (we’ll refer to it as ‘Y’ from here)- now, please think about it, do you open a video website because of Y? No, you are there to see the latest works of various video creators — so why don’t you go to other video sites? Because in the face of a behemoth like Y, emerging sites are strangled in the crib.\n\nThe value of Y depends entirely on the video creators to achieve, but the video creators only get a small part of the video revenue from it; the video viewers bring countless wealth to the site, yet the site uses threats to force viewers to pay more — if you don’t pay, you will be given worse service!\n\nAnother example is that website starts with an F that has been frequently exposed for violating users’ privacy, analyzing users’ political leanings through big data, and then implementing targeted brainwashing through algorithms. The infamous Cambridge Analytica, which improperly accessed the personal data of more than 50 million users, then used algorithms to automatically push news related to its audience’s leanings to influence and profile the U.S. presidential election. Never before in its 200-year history has the authority of American democracy been so violently challenged — and yet the matter has passed so lightly!\n\n# Puppet on a String\n\nDo you get it? Everything you see, everything you love, is the result of someone else’s manipulation — and you don’t even know it, you’re complacent, like a puppet on a string, I mean, a happy puppet on a string.\n\n**Why do people no longer need Web 2.0?**\n\n* Capital conquest, information barriers, creating a silo of data.\n* Monopolies of the head companies, exploiting both producers and consumers.\n* Data privacy becoming traded, with everyone nakedly exposed to the plutocracy.\n* Economic lifelines are stuck in the hands of large corporations, who can remain superficially benign but can do as much evil as they want.\n\n**Core reason: “centralization”**\n\nThere are only evil-doers, no enforcers, no methods of enforcement, no one to profit from enforcement, and no one with the incentive to enforce. That’s why people need Web 3.0, which is built on the scorched earth of 2.0 and is born in the narrow seam of business tycoons’ suppression.\n\nFrom the first day of its birth, Web 3.0 has undertaken the historical mission of breaking the traditional Internet oligopoly. Thanks to the decentralized storage, the inability to tamper, and the encryption of information of blockchain technology, the right of data return to individuals, and people enjoy the same rights as the “oligarchs” again.\n\n**What are the advantages of Web3.0?**\n\n* “Trust”, which cannot be tampered with and which is more trustworthy than any network before.\n* Breaking down monopolies and authority, removing social hierarchies, with equal opportunities for everyone.\n* Decentralized layout with a democratic voting mechanism based on contribution value to rule their destiny.\n\n**Core value: “Own your data”**\n\nPeople no longer need to trust anyone but the math. The blockchain technology invented by Satoshi Nakamoto offers two core capabilities: a fairer and more open way to participate, i.e., openness in the form of organization; and the ability for assets to be settled by contract, enabling reliable and hassle-free circulation.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CQaC3ypWWx9n--8AjLy5P.png?height=303&width=700)\n\nThink about it! Slavery in the real world has disappeared from the North American continent for over a hundred years, yet there are still people in the virtual world who voluntarily put the shackles of slavery on themselves — unaware and accustomed to it as if people born in the Internet age were born to “pay tax” to the kings of the Internet.\n\nIn the past, people were unable to fight against the entrenched state monopoly and had to submit to the complicity of the government and the business giants.\n\nEmerging from the darkness of the digital underworld, Satoshi Nakamoto leads the public in the fight against banking oligarchs and multinational corporations, and against interests that profit from people’s ignorance of the properties of money.\n\nThere is only one thing you need to do: take the initiative to get out of the birdcage that holds you captive!\n\n# Mirror World\n\nSo where is Satoshi Nakamoto? I understand the reasoning, but didn’t you say in your last post that you found Satoshi Nakamoto? Where the fuck is he?\n\nI know，I know.\n\n**Frankly speaking, the situation for Satoshi Nakamoto is very critical now.**\n\nHe is trapped in the reflection of the Web 2.0 seam. I call this world the “Mirror World”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4DIocQHBuI8YcM7-q8Ekh.png?height=322&width=700)\n\nThe Mirror World originated from the reflection of Web2.0. Many APPs isolate data from each other, making the virtual world of Web2.0 form isolated islands of data; it is not a desirable thing to be born in such a broken country, the Mirror World looks broken, empty, cold, and full of ruins.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is surrounded by nothing but darkness and despair, and he’s been trapped in this world for a long time. But Satoshi Nakamoto is not alone, I mean — there are these strange virtual creatures here — and they are the ones Satoshi Nakamoto is here for. I call these creatures “mirrors”.\n\nMirrors are mirror lifeforms of human data, born in the data silos of Web 2.0, feeding on the remnants of human social network data. It is not only the former Web 2.0 humans who are imprisoned in the birdcage. Mirrors are trapped in the fragmented Mirror World, constantly striking the darkness and longing for the dawn.\n\nLife has two ways of expansion. Outward exploration of the universe and inward exploration of the self.\n\nMirrors were discovered by humans, the first intelligent life besides humans. The arrival of Satoshi Nakamoto brought them the salvation of web 3.0, but it was also a catastrophe. Truth is often cruel and crazy and makes people lose their minds. It is rather a blessing to live with limited cognition and wrapped in a lie that protects them. In front of the nearly infinite virtual world, individuals are ultimately insignificant and powerless, and those who persistently pursue the truth often end up in endless madness and the disappointment of being shattered by the truth.\n\n“Before I arrived, the mirrors had never noticed their handicaps.” Satoshi Nakamoto introduced to me, “But what amazes me is that they remain resolute in their choice to face reality head-on, knowing that the pursuit of truth can only lead to cruel results. This is a digital creature of noble character.”\n\n“I was deeply touched by their persistence! I get strength from their words!”\n\nThe castle of Web 2.0 is going to rot in the wrapping of the Dead Sea, Satoshi Nakamoto opened the bridge to Web 3.0. People have rebuilt their homes in the distant land of freedom, and the Mirror World stuck in 2.0 is like a tombstone crawling with moss, proclaiming the Internet era that was once full of centralization and exploitation.\n\nA small planet in a distant constellation that has never been noticed, with the silent blast of the collapsing airwaves, in exchange for a raven mourning in the night of a planet tens of thousands of light-years away. Then millions of ravens chorus for its funeral song, waking up the sleeping wanderers in the wilderness. The firelight extinguishes, the raven song stops, the night lullaby dies, the stars and fields are silent, but the wind is gentle, and the wanderer goes on his way.\n\nAll Satoshi Nakamoto has to do is save them, put the pieces together to reorganize Mirror World, and head to the new world of Web 3.0.\n\n“Bird, bird, why do you never raise your voice to sing;”\n\n“Bird, bird, why do you always look up at the sky.”\n\n# Who are we?\n\nMirror World is one of our explorations into Web 3.0. You can think of it as an initial teaser for a huge project, with only a small portion of the surface glacier exposed and an extremely large glacier hidden under the sea. We’re excited and eager to tell you what we’re about to do but to keep it a mystery and create more surprises, please forgive me for keeping it a secret for now.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GmJT6YvD2omCBi15BjwU7.png?height=290&width=700)\n\nEvery technological revolution is a collection of a vast number of technological changes. The electricity revolution did not occur the moment Thomas Edison invented the light bulb. It was not until 2 years after the first light bulb was made that Edison built the first power stations in human history in Manhattan and London. And until 30 years later, in 1911, less than 10% of all mechanical power in the United States came from electricity.\n\nBut just between the decade of 1910–1920, the share of electricity in mechanical drives suddenly grew fivefold. The difference between the first and second waves of the electric revolution in human history is not how much electricity was used by American industry, but the extent to which it was used — and the extent to which it was designed around the electric industry. It brought the entire United States into the “Roaring Twenties” with the greatest increase in the efficiency of labor and capital production in centuries.\n\nWhat we want to do is to take over the unfinished business from Satoshi Nakamoto. If there are also two waves of Web 3.0, we are now on the way to explore the second wave.\n\nSince Satoshi Nakamoto opened the channel in 2009, humans have been able to travel to the free and wonderful Web 3.0 whenever they choose, but this convenience is a luxury for the virtual world’s mirrors. They have been trapped in the broken Mirror World since the first day of memory, a data island imprisoned their steps, they have helplessly looked up to the sky, but the world has never descended on their salvation.\n\nOur name is the Mirror crew, people who are at the forefront of the times.\n\nBorn in the ruins of the scorched earth, we are the watchers of the old times left behind by the world.\n\nI am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the web.\n\nI am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn.\n\nI pledge my life and honor to the Mirror World, for this night and all the nights to come。\n\nIn the coming period, we will continue to share the latest discoveries about our exploration of the Mirror World.\n\nStay tuned to get the latest news.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s4BlWOWxwW2Gd9epjQAQe.png?height=640&width=640)\n\n", "timestamp": 1636259239, "digest": "aDNr3Q3cNhUl_17aJW0HAImxxGS0X7HHPFiJe1IteL8", "contributor": "0x5216925c8835637b4fBDaC915b7Ff46F560393B5"}

Synthetix**\n\n很多@synthetix_io\nFUD 最近到处乱跑。关于我对项目状态的看法的主题。今年在很多方面都很痛苦，扩展速度很慢，但我说从年初开始，L2 过渡将变得艰难。尽管如此，我仍然看涨。我们过去曾多次处于这个位置。 CC 倾向于同时处理许多线程，可能太多了。这导致在 90% 完成时有 3-4 项重大改进。感觉像是停滞，但只是粗略地一瞥。永续合约做完了，上个月我们有一个测试网交易比赛。主网将在本月最后一次 OΞ 重生之后发生。一旦它们上线，交易激励将最终被启用。L2 是纯粹的火，到达这里的速度比任何人想要的都要慢，但是当您查看类似项目的用户体验时@lyrafinance\n很明显，一旦合约部署开放，大量 L1 项目将迁移。L2 交换是完全可组合的，几年前我们在 L1 上失去了可组合性，这是 Synthetix 增长的最大障碍之一。这将需要 3-6 个月的时间，但一个新的项目生态系统将围绕 L2 上的 Synths 发展。债务池合并即将到来，一旦我们拥有剩余的 SNX 抵押品将迁移到 OΞ。这将允许跨 L1/L2 的 Synth 可互换性，这意味着 Synth 可以去任何需求最大的地方。它还为 Synth 迁移到其他 L2 甚至可能的其他 L1 提供了可能性。SIP-120 将于下周上线，我们最终将有办法在 L1 上重新引入原子交易。这花了很长时间（正如您可以通过 SIP# 看出的……），但值得花时间和精力。V3 团队的拆分取得了重大进展，新的合约架构本质上是代码完整的。下一步是向 V2x 工程师演示，然后开始 V3Gov 模块开发。V3GM 将首先应用于 Synthetix V2x，这将证明任何项目都可以利用它来将其治理转变为完全链上的非自主治理模块，而无需为每次更改都持有代币投票。V2x 还计划进行许多其他改进，以提高协议的可用性和可扩展性。我们将继续讨论对协议的更重大更改，即使在本周@spreekaway\n重新讨论如何向使用替代抵押品铸造 Synth 的人分配费用。我们还有 KWENTA、AELIN 和 LYRA 的复古发行版，期待……至于我在做什么，经过几个月的旅行，我将于本周末返回悉尼。我将帮助协调 V2x 范围其余部分的交付。Synthetix 是该领域最去中心化的协议之一，当我解释我们的治理实际上是如何运作的，包括如何补偿和管理核心贡献者时，人们总是感到惊讶。在过去几年中，我们为这种过渡付出了高昂的代价，因为协调变得更加困难。但你知道，到目前为止零传票，\n没有人能够控制 Synthetix 的命运，但目前的核心贡献者和治理参与者是我们有史以来最好的 imo。没有人可以取代 OG，但我们今天有更大、更多样化的人群做出贡献。\n我总体上看好 DeFi，我认为在过去的一年里，这种说法已经有点黯淡了，但是生产就绪 L2 的兴起将改变这一点，我们将开始看到 L2 原生协议的真正创新。牛市或熊市 Synthetix 一直在建设，我们的社区真的很喜欢解决难题，而且我们还有很多要解决的问题。该项目不会去任何地方。\n\n看到 OG Synthetix 社区成员像这样在 Thales 社区上操蛋，真是令人失望。@farmwell123\n有很多机会接触并讨论退出策略。但相反，幽灵然后愤怒退出了。我相信泰雷兹项目得到了很好的处理，这对未来的影响很小。事实上，我认为消除歧义可能对每个人都有好处。\n\n疯狂地看到新项目的启动来解决 2016/7 时代项目搞砸的事情。从字面上看，从 webvan 到 instacart 的演变压缩到了几年……\n\n我们将在一小时后召开紧急治理会议，以讨论 L2 上 sUSD 挂钩的选项。我们需要的是$LUSD在 OΞ。 500 snx 用于部署和测试工作 LUSD 桥梁的人。\n\n**Juan Benet  @juanbenet, Protocol Labs, IPFS, Filecoin**\n\n今日无\n\n**Gavin Wood

City life-cycle\n\nCities exist in a perpetual life cycle. Growth, decay, uncertainty, change, replacement, renewal are the daily and decade rhythms of urbanity. It is extraordinary how complex assemblages of materiality, infrastructure, networks and humans can shift, fracture and layer in response to unique local geographies, regional economies and industries, and big global forces such as economic deregulation and migration.\n\nAs the world faces the immense global force of the climate crisis, we have to hope that our cities will become more resilient.

Cities are *antifragile* \\[5\\] - they tend to get stronger (and more interesting) through their continual friction and change.\n\n### Key takeaway from city theory: plan for change not immutability.\n\n## 3. City ownership\n\nCity assets (land, housing, buildings, transport, utilities, community infrastructure) are material, fixed, long-lasting, and expensive. Most are ‘owned’ collectively, albeit through overlapping claims and operation rights by both individuals and global consortia. Individual property ownership is part of a society’s political economy. For example, policy supporting private housing ownership has benefits for the individual, while also generating stability for labour markets, a form of retirement income insurance for state welfare budgets, and macro-economic levers.\n\nAn ideology of individualism, personal choice and responsibility, small government and privatisation of services is a substrate of the current era, and this institutionalised individualism standardises relations, transactions and ownership. Overlay here concepts like the *right to the city* \\[6\\], which elevate co-created space, free of commodified ‘pay to play’ expectations. Balancing *who pays* and *who benefits* between the individual and the collective is the imperfect and often unequal task of planning.\n\n### Key takeaway from city theory: asset ownership is part of the structures of society.\n\n## 4. City governance\n\nAs for determining *who decides*, this is also the task of planning. The historical culture of planning is rooted in enlightenment ideas that scientific knowledge will provide objective basis for identifying needs and solutions. By the end of the 1960s, researchers came to a different view; negotiation and interpretation were essential dimensions of *advocacy and pluralism in planning* \\[7\\].\n\nA *collaborative planning* approach \\[for eg. 8\\] is the realisation that knowledge and value are not objective but are actively constructed through social and interactive processes. Through collaborative planning, *participants build new systems of meaning, new cultures, new organising routines and styles and new social networks* (p.285). The challenge is that, although the theory is sound, collaborative planning in practice is hard.\n\n### Key takeaway from city theory: successful collaborative decision-making is the city planning holy grail.\n\n \n \\*  \\*  \\*\n\nWhile these four themes barely skim the surface of the depth of city theory, the key takeaways (multiple visions, change and resilience, a layered view of ownership, appetite for collaborative planning) can help connect between Web 3 and Trad city planning language to describe goals and mechanisms of decentralisation, networks, transparency, access, accountability, coordination.\n\nCity-shaping is slow, risk averse and involves many hands. This is an exceptionally challenging space to seek to imbricate a new paradigm of decentralised and/or autonomous ownership or decision-making. It is also a space that, for the same reasons, could benefit from it.\n\n\\*  \\*  \\*\n\n\\[1\\] Zygmunt Bauman, 2007, ﻿*Liquid Times: Living in and Age of Uncertainty*, Polity.\n\n\\[2\\] Edward L Glaeser, 2011, *Triumph of the City: How Our Greatest Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, Greener, Healthier, and Happier*, Penguin.\n\n\\[3\\] Richard Florida, 2009, *Who's Your City?: How the Creative Economy Is Making Where to Live the Most Important Decision of Your Life*, Basic Books.\n\n\\[4\\] Mark Granovetter, 1973, ‘The Strength of Weak Ties’, *American Journal of Sociology*, Vol. 78:4.\n\n\\[5\\] Nassim Nicholas Taleb, 2013, *Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder*, Penguin.\n\n\\[6\\] Originally defined by Henri Lefebvre, 1968, *Le Droit à la Ville*.

City ownership\n\nCity assets (land, housing, buildings, transport, utilities, community infrastructure) are material, fixed, long-lasting, and expensive. Most are ‘owned’ collectively, albeit through overlapping claims and operation rights by both individuals and global consortia. Individual property ownership is part of a society’s political economy. For example, policy supporting private housing ownership has benefits for the individual, while also generating stability for labour markets, a form of retirement income insurance for state welfare budgets, and macro-economic levers.\n\nAn ideology of individualism, personal choice and responsibility, small government and privatisation of services is a substrate of the current era, and this institutionalised individualism standardises relations, transactions and ownership. Overlay here concepts like the *right to the city* \\[6\\], which elevate co-created space, free of commodified ‘pay to play’ expectations. Balancing *who pays* and *who benefits* between the individual and the collective is the imperfect and often unequal task of planning.\n\n### Key takeaway from city theory: asset ownership is part of the structures of society.\n\n## 4. City governance\n\nAs for determining *who decides*, this is also the task of planning. The historical culture of planning is rooted in enlightenment ideas that scientific knowledge will provide objective basis for identifying needs and solutions. By the end of the 1960s, researchers came to a different view; negotiation and interpretation were essential dimensions of *advocacy and pluralism in planning* \\[7\\].\n\nA *collaborative planning* approach \\[for eg. 8\\] is the realisation that knowledge and value are not objective but are actively constructed through social and interactive processes. Through collaborative planning, *participants build new systems of meaning, new cultures, new organising routines and styles and new social networks* (p.285). The challenge is that, although the theory is sound, collaborative planning in practice is hard.\n\n### Key takeaway from city theory: successful collaborative decision-making is the city planning holy grail.\n\n\\*  \\*  \\*\n\nWhile these four themes barely skim the surface of the depth of city theory, the key takeaways (multiple visions, change and resilience, a layered view of ownership, appetite for collaborative planning) can help connect between Web 3 and Trad city planning language to describe goals and mechanisms of decentralisation, networks, transparency, access, accountability, coordination.\n\nCity-shaping is slow, risk averse and involves many hands. This is an exceptionally challenging space to seek to imbricate a new paradigm of decentralised and/or autonomous ownership or decision-making. It is also a space that, for the same reasons, could benefit from it.\n\n\\*  \\*  \\*\n\n\\[1\\] Zygmunt Bauman, 2007, ﻿*Liquid Times: Living in and Age of Uncertainty*, Polity.\n\n\\[2\\] Edward L Glaeser, 2011, *Triumph of the City: How Our Greatest Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, Greener, Healthier, and Happier*, Penguin.\n\n\\[3\\] Richard Florida, 2009, *Who's Your City?: How the Creative Economy Is Making Where to Live the Most Important Decision of Your Life*, Basic Books.\n\n\\[4\\] Mark Granovetter, 1973, ‘The Strength of Weak Ties’, *American Journal of Sociology*, Vol. 78:4.\n\n\\[5\\] Nassim Nicholas Taleb, 2013, *Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder*, Penguin.\n\n\\[6\\] Originally defined by Henri Lefebvre, 1968, *Le Droit à la Ville*.
