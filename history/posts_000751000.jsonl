{"id": "pEbN8GXh3byojTL2ea8AAZsvFg4fwJ1r_ijl-WYIJoQ", "title": "Tutorial: How to Mint alETH on Alchemix", "body": "[Alchemix](https://alchemix.fi/) lets you take out loans against Ethereum and/or DAI that repay themselves over time. Using synthetic tokens native to the protocol & backed by future yield, users can deposit ETH or DAI to mint alETH or alUSD, which can be borrowed and used however you want.\n\nHow do the loans repay themselves? When you deposit collateral into Alchemix, it starts generating yield immediately from [Yearn Finance vaults](https://yearn.finance/vaults). The yield earned on your collateral is then used to pay off the loan you took out.\n\nWhile other platforms like [Compound](https://compound.finance/) or [Aave](https://aave.com/) allow you to lend/borrow crypto, Alchemix sets itself apart by paying back your loan for you. This allows you to \"set it and forget it\" and never worry about liquidation.\n\n### Let's dig deeper on how this works.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2b077f4e-4574-4e3b-9436-6a34abb36d1d.png?height=1688&width=2627)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe [Alchemix dApp](https://app.alchemix.fi/) has 4 main parts:\n\n- Vaults\n- Transmuter\n- Farming\n- Treasury\n\nFor the sake of this guide, we'll discuss the basics of how to mint + borrow alETH. After minting alETH, you can swap it for other tokens, or stake it in a liquidity pool.\n\n### **Step 1:** Connect your ETH wallet by pressing the connect button in the top right corner of the Alchemix dApp.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/70b04557-b90e-46d2-9896-c25acb03f1f4.png?height=1952&width=3840)\n\nYou can connect any WalletConnect compatible wallet, or use the MetaMask Chrome extension (recommended) to quickly sign in.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/70856a2b-b3d6-4f9e-8c1e-5070e5643cf0.png?height=1590&width=2880)\n\n\n### **Step 2:** Once your wallet is connected, click the Vault tab in the top navigation bar, and select ETH from the USD/ETH slider.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b3e14dc5-1add-4172-854a-30de1bbe43f6.png?height=1951&width=3840)\n\n### **Step 3:** Deposit ETH into the Vault using the Deposit tab.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0e43a346-57f6-4f6e-9f43-9fc3a6a2dd59.png?height=1946&width=3840)\n\nType in the amount of ETH you want to deposit, or use the % buttons to deposit a certain % of the total amount of ETH in your wallet.\n\n- Your \"wallet balance\" should show the total amount of ETH in your wallet.\n\n- Your \"collateral balance\" should show the total amount of ETH you've deposited into the Alchemix smart contract, which will be used as collateral for the loans you take out.\n\n- \"Available to withdraw\" shows the amount of ETH you can withdraw while still maintaining a <25% loan to value ratio.\n\n- \"ETH APY\" shows the Annual Percentage Yield your deposited ETH will earn via [yearn.finance vaults](https://yearn.finance/vaults). You don't have to do anything to begin earning this APY — Alchemix will take care of it for you. The yield generated from these vaults will then be harvested & used to pay down the global debt in the Alchemix system, paying back everyone's loans slowly but surely.\n\n### **Step 4:** Borrow alETH using the Borrow tab.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/624a4a6e-8a48-40ad-96b5-54389b347014.png?height=1943&width=3840)\n\nYou're able to borrow up to 25% of your deposited ETH in a synthetic ETH token called alETH. For every bit of ETH you want to borrow, an equal amount of alETH will be automatically minted.\n\nJust as you deposited ETH into the Alchemix vault in the Deposit tab, type in the amount of alETH you want to mint/borrow in the Borrow tab, or use the % buttons.\n\nThis alETH can then be swapped for other tokens or staked in various Alchemix related liquidity pools to earn extra yield.\n\n\n### **__Congratulations! You've officially learned to mint & borrow alETH using Alchemix.__**\n\n***\n\nIf you have any questions about this guide, feel free to reach out directly on Twitter [@NotZachDavidson](https://twitter.com/NotZachDavidson).\n", "timestamp": 1629272212, "digest": "1DawsxSdv3GXVzcLhAd_GxV22EF4FZettQOtSIQhMR8", "contributor": "0xE8B0016130A38f26c116576A7b13267c9FB11B59"}

{"id": "dTAAJWQjHPy2Zj58HoA_KLDkdmfl8mQAFu4wp423pxY", "title": "Splitting Ownership and Display/Consumption", "body": "[I wrote about NFTs last week](https://avc.com/2021/08/the-opening/) and said this in that post:\n\n> But when [a party](https://avc.com/2021/08/funding-friday-partybid/) emerges online that anyone is invited to attend and the 500 person group picks up a punk with a party hat and they all change their social network avatar to this, well that got my attention.\n>\n> https\\://avc.com/2021/08/the-opening/\n\nFractional/collective ownership is something we have been interested in at USV for a while. It fits well with [our thesis about expanding access](https://www.usv.com/writing/2018/04/usv-thesis-3-0/). We have an investment in [Otis](https://www.usv.com/writing/2019/07/otis-2/) that is [providing fractional ownership for collectibles and NFTs](https://www.withotis.com/).\n\nBut there is an important difference between fractional/collective ownership of physical and digital goods.\n\nWhen you purchase a share of a 1985 Air Jordan collection, [as I did](https://avc.com/2020/02/my-1985-nike-air-jordan-investment/), you can’t showcase it in your home or office. It is shared ownership with many others. So it goes to a gallery or somewhere it can be shown publicly. That’s fine but somehow less satisfying than having it in your home or office for everyone who comes to visit you to see.\n\nContrast that to what happened with the punk. Everyone who bought it put it on their Twitter avatar. They collectively displayed it on their own digital property.\n\nThat is because of an important point [my partner Albert made in this post a few months ag](https://continuations.com/post/645017712412786688/a-word-on-nfts)o.\n\n> The underlying misconception here is to think that in the digital world copies are indistinguishable from originals. In a trivial sense this is true. Let’s say you copy a digital artwork, you will now have exactly the same bit sequence as the original. But in a much more profound sense it is not.\n>\n> https\\://continuations.com/post/645017712412786688/a-word-on-nfts\n\nWhat NFTs do for digital art (images/Punks, videos/Top Shots, music, animations, etc, etc) is they separate the concept of ownership and the display and consumption of them. The ownership is on a public secure ledger. The display and consumption of them is out in the open for everyone to see and hear and more.\n\nThat’s not something that is easy to wrap your head around but it is profound.\n", "timestamp": 1629295685, "digest": "PiyG9p7hliYuX9l1FXWRe7Iutw4HeHIE1HIj9sP1SUs", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

{"id": "C35rtfGc0b2Op212K93QrtftF_4eAG5GMAR5StaNAwc", "title": "$WRITE Airdrop Proposal: Incentivizing a More Diverse Creator Crowd on Mirror", "body": "## A (very) short history on token airdrops:\n\nAirdrops have come a long way in the last year, most notably starting from Uniswap's [400 UNI token airdrop](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) in September of 2020. From there, we've grown into airdrops that are calculated based on the frequency and volume of interactions with different facets of a protocol. Below is one such example:\n\n[](https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1415650580299669512)\n\nWe've also seen NFT drops recently that rely on more standardized [tools built](https://galaxy.eco/) for quickly setting rules/requirements and rewards/distribution. None of these methodologies are bad, but I do believe there's still *a lot* of room for improvement. This could come from the distribution model, drop frequency, or even the token rules themselves. In this proposal, I'll be focusing on a new distribution model, one that combines data from user interactions in the Mirror $WRITE race, on Twitter, and in Mirror-related Ethereum transactions.  \n\n## Rewards, Incentives, and Governance:\n\nThe Mirror $WRITE race is a vote-based competition that occurs once a week, where the top ten writers get 1 $WRITE token. This gives them access to the platform as well as 1000 votes for the future rounds of the race. The structure is not dissimilar from most Sybil-resistant approaches where a validated party votes in a new party, however, the propagation of rounds is a lot slower as it only happens once a week. This means it takes a lot longer to really diversify away from the friends/communities of the genesis writers of the $WRITE race. For new participants who aren't very close to that initial circle, it becomes harder and harder to win as the top 10 vote floor continues to rise:\n\n[](https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297/status/1415055142928490500)\n\nWhile increasing the # of winners and base vote allocation or gamifying the prompt system could incrementally improve the race, an airdrop of $WRITE tokens would offer a much faster method of reducing the influence of the starter group and increase the diversity of writers (winners) on the platform. \n\nA key first decision here is that **airdropped tokens should *not* affect the current vote allocation** for each participant in the $WRITE race. ******But, they can still be redeemed for publications**, at 1 $WRITE token per publication. \n\nMy first thoughts when structuring this airdrop model were around \"what should an airdrop really be targeting?\" The three pillars that came to mind were: \n\n1. **Rewards:** How can we fairly compensate early users for their support and risks that were taken? They chose to publish on Mirror rather than their existing publishing platform, carrying both new funnel and smart contract risks.\n2. **Incentives:** Knowing that this model will set a precedent for rewards distribution criteria, how will that affect voter/creator/contributor behaviors going forward? \n3. **Governance:** How can the balance of power be shifted in a way that diversifies the writer community much faster? \n\nFrom there, I set three goals for the token formula:\n\n1. **Rewards:** Creators should be rewarded for their usage of web3 platform features, and contributors should be rewarded for the value (ETH) they've provided to creator projects\n2. **Incentives:** We should also incentivize contributors to support a larger array of creators, rather than just the same two or three creators (or a single community). \n3. **Governance:** We should try to amplify anyone who bridges different communities by giving them more tokens.\n\nWe know that for Mirror to thrive long-term, there needs to be diversity in creators with an equally diverse set of contributors. However, with over 7000 users it can be hard to choose who gets what allocation off of usage alone.  This is where the social graphs enter the picture, as we can use that data to identify who might be best from a community perspective to allocate greater or fewer airdrop tokens to.\n\n## Token Reward Formula:\n\n*For all of the following, $W$ stands for a weight between 0-1 and $T$ stands for $WRITE token.*\n\n1. First, let's take care of the community diversification weighting based on centrality: \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1f9190cc-2c30-431f-990e-7a40c403296a.jpeg?height=43&width=374)\n\n- Betweenness centrality is a measure that highlights the nodes that bridge the most communities. This serves to incentivize everyone to support and collaborate with more diverse communities in the future. [**See this post for details on this metric and the methodology**](https://ath.mirror.xyz/aYOJc8pihb9wxI___QR9qmM5mQ4caUyQhHJIlevspjw). We multiply it by 100 to give it more weight.\n- While the linked post above does not account for the difference in edge/relationship data type, so a mention and a 1 ETH contribution would have the same non-scaled weight), for this airdrop, we converted the multi-edge graph into a weighted directional graph. This means normalizing each edge by total mentions/contributions/votes a certain user has given, and then weighting mentions, contributions, and votes by 20x, 30x, 40x respectively. Another important change from the original post is the use of a directional graph.\n\n2. We still want to make sure creators and contributors are getting fairly rewarded. Let's define the *T_baseReward* formula as: \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8b372f08-74b2-49d5-9539-130a6fed3fcb.jpeg?height=67&width=731)\n\n- *V_votesAllocated* represents the current allocation of votes someone has in the $WRITE race. This is divided by 1000 to represent the $WRITE token balance. This is weighted by *W_voted* which represents the total votes used out of votes allocated each week (cumulatively).\n - *B_hasCreated* represents a Boolean (1 or 0 value) for if someone has created at least one entry or block (edition, split, crowdfund, auction).\n- *V^n_contributed* is the value of ETH contributed to creators (across *n* different block types). This is weighted by the unique # of creators someone has contributed to, max_min scaled into *W_contributed*. This means if the maximum number of unique creators someone has contributed to is 10, and I've also contributed to 10 creators, then I would have a *W_contributed* of 1. Depending on the distribution of contributors, if I've only contributed to 1 creator, I would have a *W_contributed* of something like 0.0833. Thus, we are rewarding those who both contribute to creators and support many creators, in an effort to incentivize that behavior.\n- The constants of 0.65 and 0.15 were chosen based on how many total tokens we wanted to distribute.\n3. Putting it all together, we get our total $WRITE token reward formula:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/56e9edf8-2ae0-433a-a213-b5949e76335a.jpeg?height=67&width=898)\n\n### Airdrop Results:\n\n*The results of the airdrop can be found in the following CSV file.*\n\n[mirror_finalAirdrop_cleaned_w.csv](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/1456ca0e-8847-49a1-9580-8d598525668d/mirror_finalAirdrop_cleaned_w.csv)\n\n*The data dictionary for this file can be found below:*\n\n[Mirror $WRITE Airdrop Data Dictionary](https://www.notion.so/Mirror-WRITE-Airdrop-Data-Dictionary-51f753cab17148b3a086978336f2f353)\n\n## What a Reputation-based Airdrop Enables for the Community:\n\nI believe this airdrop has iterated upon everything we built in web2 and web3, mainly due to its combined use of multiple social graphs alongside tokenized ownership. As I've [covered before](https://ath.mirror.xyz/aYOJc8pihb9wxI___QR9qmM5mQ4caUyQhHJIlevspjw), betweenness centrality is a measure that helps us target a more resilient and diverse network. Tokens are a great way to reward those who have fulfilled that behavior historically, and also as an incentive mechanism to further that diversity and resilience (support) in the future. \n\nThis proposal indirectly tackles the issue of [long-term ownership of tokens](https://gov.rarible.com/t/problems-in-the-ownership-economy/16070), where many receivers (other than core investors and the product team) sell the tokens soon after the drop. My hope is that if the tokens are distributed to an aligned subset of the community, we won't see this issue appear as strongly. I think the [Ohmies](https://twitter.com/OlympusDAO/status/1416489213185380358) are a great example of this done well. \n\nWhile this airdrop is at a protocol level, there's no reason why we couldn't go more micro in our approach and provide creators and DAOs betweenness scores for their specific social graph of contributors, voters, and Twitter interactors. They could leverage that data to then airdrop their own tokens as well. Ultimately, I think that what has been done here can be further expanded and productized to help all of us gain better visibility into and reward/incentivize each step of the community flywheel created by the team at 0xSTATION:\n\n![https://station.mirror.xyz/xlPSC6PYsazGxjo-pqyaV8M4ujtWapxhCmVQfBjmN9o](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/84dd076a-8b80-4d4d-9acf-92d18fbc4c8a.jpeg?height=651&width=713)\n\n## Sources and Methods:\n\n- All data (besides identity mappings) were publicly sourced.

{"id": "VW3DeHNI-fHHpdQqrYy4t79FFoAdM6gZoO3ARU7frv4", "title": "$WRITE Airdrop Proposal: Incentivizing a More Diverse Creator Crowd on Mirror", "body": "## A (very) short history on token airdrops:\n\nAirdrops have come a long way in the last year, most notably starting from Uniswap's [400 UNI token airdrop](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) in September of 2020. From there, we've grown into airdrops that are calculated based on the frequency and volume of interactions with different facets of a protocol. Below is one such example:\n\n[](https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1415650580299669512)\n\nWe've also seen NFT drops recently that rely on more standardized [tools built](https://galaxy.eco/) for quickly setting rules/requirements and rewards/distribution. None of these methodologies are bad, but I do believe there's still *a lot* of room for improvement. This could come from the distribution model, drop frequency, or even the token rules themselves. In this proposal, I'll be focusing on a new distribution model, one that combines data from user interactions in the Mirror $WRITE race, on Twitter, and in Mirror-related Ethereum transactions.  \n\n## Rewards, Incentives, and Governance:\n\nThe Mirror $WRITE race is a vote-based competition that occurs once a week, where the top ten writers get 1 $WRITE token. This gives them access to the platform as well as 1000 votes for the future rounds of the race. The structure is not dissimilar from most Sybil-resistant approaches where a validated party votes in a new party, however, the propagation of rounds is a lot slower as it only happens once a week. This means it takes a lot longer to really diversify away from the friends/communities of the genesis writers of the $WRITE race. For new participants who aren't very close to that initial circle, it becomes harder and harder to win as the top 10 vote floor continues to rise:\n\n[](https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297/status/1415055142928490500)\n\nWhile increasing the # of winners and base vote allocation or gamifying the prompt system could incrementally improve the race, an airdrop of $WRITE tokens would offer a much faster method of reducing the influence of the starter group and increase the diversity of writers (winners) on the platform. \n\nA key first decision here is that **airdropped tokens should *not* affect the current vote allocation** for each participant in the $WRITE race. But, they can still be redeemed for publications**, at 1 $WRITE token per publication. \n\nMy first thoughts when structuring this airdrop model were around \"what should an airdrop really be targeting?\" The three pillars that came to mind were: \n\n1. **Rewards:** How can we fairly compensate early users for their support and risks that were taken? They chose to publish on Mirror rather than their existing publishing platform, carrying both new funnel and smart contract risks.\n2. **Incentives:** Knowing that this model will set a precedent for rewards distribution criteria, how will that affect voter/creator/contributor behaviors going forward? \n3. **Governance:** How can the balance of power be shifted in a way that diversifies the writer community much faster? \n\nFrom there, I set three goals for the token formula:\n\n1. **Rewards:** Creators should be rewarded for their usage of web3 platform features, and contributors should be rewarded for the value (ETH) they've provided to creator projects\n2. **Incentives:** We should also incentivize contributors to support a larger array of creators, rather than just the same two or three creators (or a single community). \n3. **Governance:** We should try to amplify anyone who bridges different communities by giving them more tokens.\n\nWe know that for Mirror to thrive long-term, there needs to be diversity in creators with an equally diverse set of contributors. However, with over 7000 users it can be hard to choose who gets what allocation off of usage alone.  This is where the social graphs enter the picture, as we can use that data to identify who might be best from a community perspective to allocate greater or fewer airdrop tokens to.\n\n## Token Reward Formula:\n\n*For all of the following, $W$ stands for a weight between 0-1 and $T$ stands for $WRITE token.*\n\n1. First, let's take care of the community diversification weighting based on centrality: \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1f9190cc-2c30-431f-990e-7a40c403296a.jpeg?height=43&width=374)\n\n- Betweenness centrality is a measure that highlights the nodes that bridge the most communities. This serves to incentivize everyone to support and collaborate with more diverse communities in the future. [**See this post for details on this metric and the methodology**](https://ath.mirror.xyz/aYOJc8pihb9wxI___QR9qmM5mQ4caUyQhHJIlevspjw). We multiply it by 50 to give it more weight.\n- While the linked post above does not account for the difference in edge/relationship data type, so a mention and a 1 ETH contribution would have the same non-scaled weight), for this airdrop, we converted the multi-edge graph into a weighted directional graph. This means normalizing each edge by total mentions/contributions/votes a certain user has given, and then weighting mentions, contributions, and votes by 15x, 40x, 40x respectively. Another important change from the original post is the use of a directional graph.\n\n2. We still want to make sure creators and contributors are getting fairly rewarded. Let's define the *T_baseReward* formula as: \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8b372f08-74b2-49d5-9539-130a6fed3fcb.jpeg?height=67&width=731)\n\n- *V_votesAllocated* represents the current allocation of votes someone has in the $WRITE race. This is divided by 1000 to represent the $WRITE token balance. This is weighted by *W_voted* which represents the total votes used out of votes allocated each week (cumulatively).\n - *B_hasCreated* represents a Boolean (1 or 0 value) for if someone has created at least one entry or block (edition, split, crowdfund, auction).\n- *V^n_contributed* is the value of ETH contributed to creators (across *n* different block types). This is weighted by the unique # of creators someone has contributed to, max_min scaled into *W_contributed*. This means if the maximum number of unique creators someone has contributed to is 10, and I've also contributed to 10 creators, then I would have a *W_contributed* of 1. Depending on the distribution of contributors, if I've only contributed to 1 creator, I would have a *W_contributed* of something like 0.0833. Thus, we are rewarding those who both contribute to creators and support many creators, in an effort to incentivize that behavior.\n- The constants of 0.65 and 0.15 were chosen based on how many total tokens we wanted to distribute.\n3. Putting it all together, we get our total $WRITE token reward formula:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/56e9edf8-2ae0-433a-a213-b5949e76335a.jpeg?height=67&width=898)\n\n### Airdrop Results:\n\n*The results of the airdrop can be found in the following CSV file.*\n\n[mirror_finalAirdrop_cleaned_w.csv](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/1456ca0e-8847-49a1-9580-8d598525668d/mirror_finalAirdrop_cleaned_w.csv)\n\n*The data dictionary for this file can be found below:*\n\n[Mirror $WRITE Airdrop Data Dictionary](https://www.notion.so/Mirror-WRITE-Airdrop-Data-Dictionary-51f753cab17148b3a086978336f2f353)\n\n## What a Reputation-based Airdrop Enables for the Community:\n\nI believe this airdrop has iterated upon everything we built in web2 and web3, mainly due to its combined use of multiple social graphs alongside tokenized ownership. As I've [covered before](https://ath.mirror.xyz/aYOJc8pihb9wxI___QR9qmM5mQ4caUyQhHJIlevspjw), betweenness centrality is a measure that helps us target a more resilient and diverse network. Tokens are a great way to reward those who have fulfilled that behavior historically, and also as an incentive mechanism to further that diversity and resilience (support) in the future. \n\nThis proposal indirectly tackles the issue of [long-term ownership of tokens](https://gov.rarible.com/t/problems-in-the-ownership-economy/16070), where many receivers (other than core investors and the product team) sell the tokens soon after the drop. My hope is that if the tokens are distributed to an aligned subset of the community, we won't see this issue appear as strongly. I think the [Ohmies](https://twitter.com/OlympusDAO/status/1416489213185380358) are a great example of this done well. \n\nWhile this airdrop is at a protocol level, there's no reason why we couldn't go more micro in our approach and provide creators and DAOs betweenness scores for their specific social graph of contributors, voters, and Twitter interactors. They could leverage that data to then airdrop their own tokens as well. Ultimately, I think that what has been done here can be further expanded and productized to help all of us gain better visibility into and reward/incentivize each step of the community flywheel created by the team at 0xSTATION:\n\n![https://station.mirror.xyz/xlPSC6PYsazGxjo-pqyaV8M4ujtWapxhCmVQfBjmN9o](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/84dd076a-8b80-4d4d-9acf-92d18fbc4c8a.jpeg?height=651&width=713)\n\n## Sources and Methods:\n\n- All data (besides identity mappings) were publicly sourced.

We're eager to continue supporting artists, DAOs, labels, and collectives as they use Catalog to explore this space. \n\n## **Fundraise**\n\nIn late June, we officially closed a $2.2M fundraising round led by [1confirmation](https://twitter.com/1confirmation), plus [Inflection](inflection.xyz), [Delphi Digital](https://twitter.com/Delphi_Digital), [WndrCo](https://www.wndrco.com/), and others. We also have the support of almost 20 angel investors including [Cooper Turley](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa), [RAC](https://twitter.com/rac), and [Trevor McFedries](https://twitter.com/whatdotcd). You can view the full list [here](https://slate.textile.io/ipfs/bafkreifcuwhsxkpbj7h4dkb4hsntb64odwwkz3pqsqje4f7x4ukibm3xda). We're grateful to work with some of the best investors in the space who are fully onboard with our mission. In the last few weeks, we've grown the team from three to five. This funding will allow us to continue hiring core roles ([join us!](https://www.notion.so/Senior-Full-Stack-Engineer-49dab2f3fc0949a78c47dc907c72e4c4)) and evolve Catalog into a sustainable and flourishing web3 music hub.\n\n## A new medium for music\n\nCatalog records are a way to permanently archive music. With verifiably authentic origins by means of an artist's crypto signature, Catalog records represent the canonical version of an artist's work online, and are distinct from their digital copies. When an artist sells a Catalog record, 100% of the initial sale hits their wallet directly and instantly, making it the truest direct-to-fan format that exists today. Many of us remember when other streaming services publicly teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, when artists wondered if their music and followings they accrued would disappear overnight – thanks to the power of the blockchain and flexibility of Zora, Catalog records don't need Catalog to remain intact and capture value. \n\nOnce pressed, a Catalog record is a blank canvas for whatever its creator or holder or... anyone else, can dream up. Today, that might mean gated Discord access for collectors, running a resale through [PartyBid](https://www.partybid.app), or splitting revenue with collaborators via Mirror. Soon, it could look like a group of fans joining forces to buy the original piece to trigger a wider release, or album crowdfunding with profits automatically distributed back to the day-one supporters. Longer term, the limit is simply the best we can collectively do to design a better value system.\n\n## A different type of music platform\n\nDSPs like Spotify and Apple Music have set the bar low, demanding unrealistic release schedules, stripping music of its context, and packaging it all into a socially siloed, [homogenous](https://twitter.com/cheriehu42/status/1230242352436043776?s=21) experience for the end listener. Artists and fans couldn't be further removed from each other. The industry has adopted an unsustainable revenue model that often leaves artists with next to nothing, and the per-play valuation model incentivizes artists to release music that optimizes for playlist placements and quick hooks. We love a great pop song, but without more alternatives, artists who want to do something different are at risk.\n\nWhat if artists had the option to surround their music with images, influences, attributions, and stories? What if platforms facilitated community building and encouraged digging? What if listeners had tools to bend and modify their favorite music? What if platforms had built-in incentive structures that worked to maximally benefit both artists and fans? What if communities had financial and decision making power in the platforms they contribute value to? \n\nWe're excited to build something better.\n\n## Community ownership\n\nCatalog owes much of its existence to the artists, fans, and collectors who share a better view of the future. Web3 projects can uniquely empower those who bring value to the platforms they use, and to that end we'll be taking gradual, transparent steps towards putting financial and decision making power into the hands of our community. While the term community ownership is thrown around in [different contexts](https://ff.mirror.xyz/ZRsr5HZMfbHOEe2lIYoWinRCI65NlvDW_QzEu1rn7As), this is what it means to us.\n\n- **Real agency.** While Catalog is currently being bootstrapped by our small team, over time we'll turn over more and more decision making power to the community. Other creative communities such as SuperRare and Friends With Benefits have already set precedents with creative ownership; over time, our cohort of artists and listeners will be able to shape the future of web3 music for all, not just the few.\n- **Financial ownership.** Catalog will succeed because of the artists, labels, collectors, etc that take steps with us towards a communal future for musicians. They deserve to share in the that upside.\n- **Transparency**. This means being open about everything we do at Catalog, from our backers to our product decisions.\n\n\n## Closing thoughts\nTo be successful, we're going to need to present new forms of curation, attention distribution, royalty structures, and attribution in ways that simply don't exist in music today. As we grow our team we'll be accelerating our efforts towards bringing many of the ideas laid out here into reality. Until then, we're excited for the future and thank you from the bottom of our hearts for rocking with us.", "timestamp": 1629316934, "digest": "_1cx6mdOEH6wg7qumY7Ac2n6AYiDvfC5S8fNL0dYy78", "contributor": "0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}

{"id": "moPhVLrZhM7zpuHqH4L7O5ZBboKDCTKDz8rPvGPa4VQ", "title": "The dApp Ecosystem", "body": "I was having dinner with a friend in tech last week and our conversation touched on cryptocurrency and [decentralized apps](https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-a-decentralized-application-dapp/) (dApps). Neither of us have the depth to go very deep, but we know enough to get ourselves into trouble.\n\nThere are many smart people working on these problems, building games and applications along with infrastructure to power the ecosystem.\n\nI have been casually keeping up with DAU numbers on [DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/) so I decided to ask my friend what he thought they were for the popular collectable cat game, CryptoKitties. Back in December, CryptoKitties [took off like a rocketship](https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/03/people-have-spent-over-1m-buying-virtual-cats-on-the-ethereum-blockchain/) when it launched—congesting the Ethereum blockchain and kitties selling for as much as a hundred thousand dollars.\n\nHis guess: 10,000 DAU. The actual count in the last thirty days hovers between 300 and 500 DAU. The amount of ether moved is also fairly low.\n\n![](https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/2122618/mgU3AGvOTK9AmmTjfUZawNnr9as/medium_Screen_Shot_2018-08-18_at_12.35.05.png?)\n\n![](https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/2122618/mgU3AGvOTK9AmmTjfUZawNnr9as/medium_Screen_Shot_2018-08-18_at_12.35.05.png?&size=large)\n\nContrasting this to when CryptoKitties first launched, it's quite a ways off.\n\n![](https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/2122619/K1Z_v4QMHnFwSTXqeUFSnsZQnZk/medium_Screen_Shot_2018-08-18_at_12.39.53.png?size=large)\n\nCasual observers, like my friend, that heard about CryptoKitties during the launch would have no problem assuming the numbers were still somewhat consistent to then. Perhaps they factor in cryptos general decline since the winter, but still they would have no reason to assume that it dropped by orders of magnitude.\\\\\n\nThe interesting product analysis is around these lower DAU numbers. Obviously large usage numbers are good, but smaller ones aren't necessarily a sign of a product's demise.\n\nSo what happened/is happing to CryptoKitties? And can we use the answer as a litmus of health for dApps in general?\n\nA likely explanation is one of timing and now intense usage by a small number of people. Digital, collectible cats were tightly coupled to the speculation that saw crypto's astronomical rise, causing them to crash back down inline with everything else. Timing turned sour pretty quickly.\n\nCryptoKitties are still tied to the health of ETH, but might also be moving outside of the speculatory shadow cast by general crypto. Now the only people using these dApps are the ones that actually like using them. They likely aren't using CryptoKitties or another dApp as a means to get rich quick. They genuinely like digital cats or whatever.\n\nEven with DAUs in the low- to mid-hundreds, CryptoKitties sees over three thousand transactions every day. That's rabid usage for a small number of people.\n\nHaving a small number of users that absolutely love a product is much better than the opposite of having many users that are indifferent. Indifference stalls growth and creates zombie products. True fans will use the product throughout their waking hours, will think about using it when they aren't, and tell everyone they know about it.\n\nAt some point though, the true fans need to start converting others into users and the product needs to grow organically.\n\nWhen you hear people scoff at low usage numbers, it's always a good idea to take a step back and assess whether or not there are true fans present. Over time, true fans have the potential to form the base of a product quietly growing from a few to many, many more.\n\nThis is how Google, Snapchat, and many others got their start. The same might be said for dApps some day.", "timestamp": 1629319240, "digest": "MWt9SgWnxfbU64TvWHrAZjfCPceIqTR5xA2NQ6IDt2Y", "contributor": "0x5FE6C3F8d12D5Ad1480F6DC01D8c7864Aa58C523"}

It fits well with [our thesis about expanding access](https://www.usv.com/writing/2018/04/usv-thesis-3-0/). We have an investment in [Otis](https://www.usv.com/writing/2019/07/otis-2/) that is [providing fractional ownership for collectibles and NFTs](https://www.withotis.com/testing).\n\n# Testing\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9ee64cce-fb45-47f4-b0f3-1d3f0178d52c.jpg?height=595&width=600)\n\nContrast that to what happened with the punk. Everyone who bought it put it on their Twitter avatar. They collectively displayed it on their own digital property.\n\n```\nGreat one, for real!\n```\n\nThat is because of an important point [my partner Albert made in this post a few months ago](https://continuations.com/post/645017712412786688/a-word-on-nfts).\n\n> The underlying misconception here is to think that in the digital world copies are indistinguishable from originals. In a trivial sense this is true. Let’s say you copy a digital artwork, you will now have exactly the same bit sequence as the original. But in a much more profound sense it is not.\n>\n> https://continuations.com/post/645017712412786688/a-word-on-nfts\n\nBut there is an important difference between fractional/collective ownership of physical and digital goods.\n\nWhen you purchase a share of a 1985 Air Jordan collection, [as I did](https://avc.com/2020/02/my-1985-nike-air-jordan-investment/), you can’t showcase it in your home or office. It is shared ownership with many others. So it goes to a gallery or somewhere it can be shown publicly. That’s fine but somehow less satisfying than having it in your home or office for everyone who comes to visit you to see.\n\n[ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/984](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/984)\n\nWhat NFTs do for digital art (images/Punks, videos/Top Shots, music, animations, etc, etc) is they separate the concept of ownership and the display and consumption of them. The ownership is on a public secure ledger. The display and consumption of them is out in the open for everyone to see and hear and more.\n\nThat’s not something that is easy to wrap your head around but it is profound.", "timestamp": 1629320729, "digest": "ETzRViXEg4994eTHwgPN7ThiT_UZm7w8PRYGTG-KiaI", "contributor": "0x841fF85B6873d7bfB712C8f7A347C774355b6EC3"}

They are now found only in parts of [Borneo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borneo) and [Sumatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatra), but during the [Pleistocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene) they ranged throughout [Southeast Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia) and [South China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China). Classified in the [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) ***Pongo***, orangutans were originally considered to be one species. From 1996, they were divided into two species: the [Bornean orangutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bornean_orangutan) (*P. pygmaeus*, with three subspecies) and the [Sumatran orangutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatran_orangutan) (*P. abelii*). In 2017, a third species, the [Tapanuli orangutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapanuli_orangutan) (*P. tapanuliensis*), was definitively identified. The orangutans are the only surviving species of the [subfamily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfamily)[Ponginae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponginae), which split from the other hominids ([gorillas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla), [chimpanzees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(genus)), and [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human)) between 19.3 to 15.7 million years ago.\n\nAccording to [molecular evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_clock), within apes (superfamily Hominoidea), the [gibbons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbon) diverged during the early [Miocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene)between 24.1 and 19.7 million years ago (mya), and the orangutans split from the African great ape lineage between 19.3 and 15.7 mya.

They are now found only in parts of [Borneo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borneo) and [Sumatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatra), but during the [Pleistocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene) they ranged throughout [Southeast Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia) and [South China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China). Classified in the [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) ***Pongo***, orangutans were originally considered to be one species. From 1996, they were divided into two species: the [Bornean orangutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bornean_orangutan) (*P. pygmaeus*, with three subspecies) and the [Sumatran orangutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatran_orangutan) (*P. abelii*). In 2017, a third species, the [Tapanuli orangutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapanuli_orangutan) (*P. tapanuliensis*), was definitively identified. The orangutans are the only surviving species of the [subfamily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfamily)[Ponginae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponginae), which split from the other hominids ([gorillas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla), [chimpanzees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(genus)), and [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human)) between 19.3 to 15.7 million years ago.\n\nAccording to [molecular evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_clock), within apes (superfamily Hominoidea), the [gibbons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbon) diverged during the early [Miocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene)between 24.1 and 19.7 million years ago (mya), and the orangutans split from the African great ape lineage between 19.3 and 15.7 mya. Israfil and colleagues (2011) estimated based on [mitochondrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA), [Y-linked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome), and [X-linked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome) [loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)) that the Sumatran and Bornean species diverged 4.9 to 2.9 mya.[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangutan#cite_note-Israfil_et_al-23)(Fig. 4) By contrast, the 2011 genome study suggested that these two species diverged around 400,000 years ago, more recently than was previously thought. Also, the orangutan genome was found to have evolved much more slowly than chimpanzee and human DNA.[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangutan#cite_note-nature-21)\n\nA 2017 genome study found that the Bornean and Tapanuli orangutans diverged from Sumatran orangutans about 3.4 mya, and from each other around 2.4 mya.

It fits well with [our thesis about expanding access](https://www.usv.com/writing/2018/04/usv-thesis-3-0/). We have an investment in [Otis](https://www.usv.com/writing/2019/07/otis-2/) that is [providing fractional ownership for collectibles and NFTs](https://www.withotis.com/).\n\nBut there is an important difference between fractional/collective ownership of physical and digital goods.\n\nWhen you purchase a share of a 1985 Air Jordan collection, [as I did](https://avc.com/2020/02/my-1985-nike-air-jordan-investment/), you can’t showcase it in your home or office. It is shared ownership with many others. So it goes to a gallery or somewhere it can be shown publicly. That’s fine but somehow less satisfying than having it in your home or office for everyone who comes to visit you to see.\n\nContrast that to what happened with the punk. Everyone who bought it put it on their Twitter avatar. They collectively displayed it on their own digital property.\n\nThat is because of an important point [my partner Albert made in this post a few months ago](https://continuations.com/post/645017712412786688/a-word-on-nfts).\n\n> The underlying misconception here is to think that in the digital world copies are indistinguishable from originals. In a trivial sense this is true. Let’s say you copy a digital artwork, you will now have exactly the same bit sequence as the original. But in a much more profound sense it is not.\n>\n> https\\://continuations.com/post/645017712412786688/a-word-on-nfts\n\nWhat NFTs do for digital art (images/Punks, videos/Top Shots, music, animations, etc, etc) is they separate the concept of ownership and the display and consumption of them. The ownership is on a public secure ledger. The display and consumption of them is out in the open for everyone to see and hear and more.\n\nThat’s not something that is easy to wrap your head around but it is profound.\n", "timestamp": 1629332679, "digest": "MBhXyDgVBlxg5y4PU_NbC7aWJWd0N7sBC9Ms8UQf18w", "contributor": "0x841fF85B6873d7bfB712C8f7A347C774355b6EC3"}

You can use the “regular” one, which will sign any string (this is what’s used to sign transactions); you can use personal signatures, which add a prefix to the signed message; or you can use typed data signatures, which allow you to define a format for the message the user will sign (and display it nicely on the signature prompt).\n\n## Let’s Type some Data\n\nFor this project, I decided to go with typed data signatures (or EIP-712 signatures).

For this, we’ll need the signature we just generated and the wallet address of the signer, as well as our `domain` and `types` from the last step.\n\n```ts\nimport { recoverAddress, _TypedDataEncoder } from 'ethers/lib/utils'\n\nexport const verifySignature = (signature, message, address): boolean => {\n    const messageHash = _TypedDataEncoder.hash(domain, types, message)\n\n    return recoverAddress(messageHash, signature).toLowerCase() === address.toLowerCase()\n}\n```\n\n## In Summary\n\nThis took me quite a while to figure out (+2h 😅), so I thought I’d write it down for the next person that decides to go down this rabbit hole.

For this, we’ll need the signature we just generated and the wallet address of the signer, as well as our `domain` and `types` from the last step.\n\n```ts\nimport { recoverAddress, _TypedDataEncoder } from 'ethers/lib/utils'\n\nexport const verifySignature = (signature, message, address): boolean => {\n    const messageHash = _TypedDataEncoder.hash(domain, types, message)\n\n    return recoverAddress(\n        messageHash, signature,\n    ).toLowerCase() === address.toLowerCase()\n}\n```\n\n## In Summary\n\nThis took me quite a while to figure out (+2h 😅), so I thought I’d write it down for the next person that decides to go down this rabbit hole. Hopefully, it’ll help!", "timestamp": 1629337669, "digest": "lgIDdfbeDSElr0g7kaP0TZLkkjAqkQGPriauuYSrLlI", "contributor": "0xE340b00B6B622C136fFA5CFf130eC8edCdDCb39D"}

Artists and fans couldn't be further removed from each other. The industry has adopted an unsustainable revenue model that leaves the majority of artists with next to nothing, and the per-play valuation model incentivizes artists to release music that optimizes for playlist placements and quick hooks.

{"id": "kG8CiEkyYMEdp4lTlpl4pxCfn9-n6t6mI2WWlh6b8uY", "title": "Tutorial: Use Optimism for the first time", "body": "## What is Optimism?\n\nGiven the recurring hurdle of high gas fees and slow transaction speeds, Layer 2 solutions like [Optimism](https://optimism.io/) have become increasingly important to scale Ethereum’s network. Optimism uses optimistic rollups to bundle transactions together using smart contracts on an Ethereum side-chain before moving them to Ethereum’s mainnet. With far lower fees, far lower latency, and far greater throughput compared to Ethereum Layer 1 alone, many of your favorite DeFi protocols like [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) and [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), have already begun to deploy on the network. \n\nIf you want to be part of a faster and cheaper Ethereum future, keep reading to learn how to use Optimism. \n\n## Part 1: Setting up MetaMask for the Optimism network \n\nThe first step to using Optimism is to add the network, Optimistic Ethereum, to your wallet. \n\n- Open MetaMask and click on 'Ethereum Mainnet' (the network dropdown). \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/516649ea-c5b0-4ee4-a3e0-2247b58105de.png?height=134&width=700)\n\n\n- Select the ‘Custom RPC’ option at the bottom of the network list. Upon doing so, you’ll see this form: \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7bcb1d1b-a6f4-4b40-ba68-07eb0357191e.png?height=1044&width=696)\n\n\n- Enter the following network details into their respective fields: \n\n   - Network name: Optimism \n   - New RPC URL: https://mainnet.optimism.io \n   - ChainID: 10\n   - Symbol: ETH\n   - Block Explorer URL: https://optimistic.etherscan.io \n- Click ‘Save’ and you’ll be automatically connected to Optimism! \n\n## Part 2: Depositing onto Optimism \n\nAfter you’ve connected to Optimism, the next step is to deposit funds from the Ethereum Mainnet to the Optimism Mainnet. \n\n- Go to the [Optimism Gateway page](https://gateway.optimism.io/) and connect your MetaMask wallet. \n- Make sure you are connected to the Ethereum Mainnet by clicking on the network dropdown in MetaMask (the same dropdown you used to find the ‘Custom RPC’ option).\n- Once you’ve connected your wallet, select the amount of ETH, or other tokens you’d like to transfer. Click ‘Deposit.’ \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/727acd23-edb8-415e-9ee2-3573c219756a.png?height=816&width=794)\n\n\n- *To note: If this is your first time depositing onto Optimism, you will have to pay contract approval fees.* \n- A page will appear prompting you to again confirm your deposit by clicking ‘Deposit.’ You will then be prompted to confirm the transaction in your wallet, requiring you to pay Ethereum gas fees. \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0512638e-fa7a-47a9-97e1-6cd5afc218a4.png?height=1118&width=790)\n\n\n- After the transaction has been confirmed on Ethereum, it can take anywhere from five to twenty minutes for the funds to become available on Optimism.\n- Once the funds are available, a page will display that the transaction is complete. You can also verify the transaction on Optimistic Etherscan. \n\nNow that you’re officially on Ethereum L2, test out whether Optimism lives up to the hype by [becoming a liquidity provider on Uniswap using the Optimism network](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/s6iIQ4gRcsD0VygJiHgH8srRf-_ld1RZdNDe3Ts8XCU).

{"id": "uw1NtaC0u58xQkdkHPp6bxFHBol849W0Wwcsu9J5KTg", "title": "The dApp Ecosystem", "body": "I was having dinner with a friend in tech last week and our conversation touched on cryptocurrency and [decentralized apps](https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-a-decentralized-application-dapp/) (dApps). Neither of us have the depth to go very deep, but we know enough to get ourselves into trouble.\n\nThere are many smart people working on these problems, building games and applications along with infrastructure to power the ecosystem.\n\nI have been casually keeping up with DAU numbers on [DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/) so I decided to ask my friend what he thought they were for the popular collectable cat game, CryptoKitties. Back in December, CryptoKitties [took off like a rocketship](https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/03/people-have-spent-over-1m-buying-virtual-cats-on-the-ethereum-blockchain/) when it launched—congesting the Ethereum blockchain and kitties selling for as much as a hundred thousand dollars.\n\nHis guess: 10,000 DAU. The actual count in the last thirty days hovers between 300 and 500 DAU. The amount of ether moved is also fairly low.\n\n![](https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/2122618/mgU3AGvOTK9AmmTjfUZawNnr9as/medium_Screen_Shot_2018-08-18_at_12.35.05.png?)\n\nContrasting this to when CryptoKitties first launched, it's quite a ways off.\n\n![](https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/2122619/K1Z_v4QMHnFwSTXqeUFSnsZQnZk/medium_Screen_Shot_2018-08-18_at_12.39.53.png?)\n\nCasual observers, like my friend, that heard about CryptoKitties during the launch would have no problem assuming the numbers were still somewhat consistent to then. Perhaps they factor in cryptos general decline since the winter, but still they would have no reason to assume that it dropped by orders of magnitude.\\\\\n\nThe interesting product analysis is around these lower DAU numbers. Obviously large usage numbers are good, but smaller ones aren't necessarily a sign of a product's demise.\n\nSo what happened/is happing to CryptoKitties? And can we use the answer as a litmus of health for dApps in general?\n\nA likely explanation is one of timing and now intense usage by a small number of people. Digital, collectible cats were tightly coupled to the speculation that saw crypto's astronomical rise, causing them to crash back down inline with everything else. Timing turned sour pretty quickly.\n\nCryptoKitties are still tied to the health of ETH, but might also be moving outside of the speculatory shadow cast by general crypto. Now the only people using these dApps are the ones that actually like using them. They likely aren't using CryptoKitties or another dApp as a means to get rich quick. They genuinely like digital cats or whatever.\n\nEven with DAUs in the low- to mid-hundreds, CryptoKitties sees over three thousand transactions every day. That's rabid usage for a small number of people.\n\nHaving a small number of users that absolutely love a product is much better than the opposite of having many users that are indifferent. Indifference stalls growth and creates zombie products. True fans will use the product throughout their waking hours, will think about using it when they aren't, and tell everyone they know about it.\n\nAt some point though, the true fans need to start converting others into users and the product needs to grow organically.\n\nWhen you hear people scoff at low usage numbers, it's always a good idea to take a step back and assess whether or not there are true fans present. Over time, true fans have the potential to form the base of a product quietly growing from a few to many, many more.\n\nThis is how Google, Snapchat, and many others got their start. The same might be said for dApps some day.", "timestamp": 1629384325, "digest": "MWt9SgWnxfbU64TvWHrAZjfCPceIqTR5xA2NQ6IDt2Y", "contributor": "0x5FE6C3F8d12D5Ad1480F6DC01D8c7864Aa58C523"}

{"id": "gxe-U7qMBi3eww6ETJTblxurtBaFwjAemrncX6NNh1w", "title": "Algorithmic Insurance", "body": "The idea of Decentralized Insurance has been one of the classic examples for ideal use-cases of blockchain applications. Insurance providers may have incentives to withhold claims for as long as possible, and users have little transparency into the process — leading to an overall poor user experience. The idea of putting these insurance processes on-chain is an appealing one: insurance claims can be programatically & immediately paid out if some conditions are met, and everyone has full transparency on the state of the entire system at all times. For example, someone could buy travel insurance for their flight, and a smart contract could automatically payout if Google Flights reports that the flight was delayed. \n\nMany attempts at decentralized insurance have been tried over the years, but anything that touches the real world has not gotten much traction at all. Firstly, there are many concerns around getting *trustworthy* data on-chain — if a contract can be maliciously fed data that says a hurricane happened when it didn't, that on-chain weather insurance market is as good as useless. Secondly, the current set of Ethereum/DeFi users are not generally looking for vehicle/household/travel insurance on-chain — they are looking for something more *crypto-native*. \n\n# Smart Contract Insurance\n\nThe immense growth of DeFi in the last two years has single-handedly revived market demand for decentralized insurance products. Many individuals or funds have significant amounts of capital in these DeFi protocols, and *actually* want protection against smart contract exploits. Hence, a new wave of decentralized insurance protocols have sprung up in the last year, mostly focused on smart contract insurance. \n\nMost of these projects tend to innovate along two main axes — Payout Mechanism and Pricing: \n\nProjects like Nexus Mutual rely on a set of humans to determine if a smart contract exploit actually happened or not, and hence if payouts should happen. Others like Cozy Finance and Risk Harbour rely purely on specific on-chain conditions to be met to determine if a payout should happen. \n\nOn the pricing axis, some projects use Bonding Curves based on utilization rates to price insurance — e.g some formula that prices the cover based on the demand & supply for that insurance market. Others rely on a team of human experts to determine the \"fair\" value of coverage for a protocol based on information such as track record of the protocol not getting hacked, audits, and so on. \n\nThis post will focus on the Payout Mechanism of decentralized insurance protocols. \n\n# Algorithmic Payouts \n\nIn traditional finance, there would need to be all sorts of trusted intermediaries to verify if some event happened or not before an insurance company can pay out a claim. However, because smart contract exploits are purely on-chain events, we should be able to write programs on-chain that determine if the other on-chain events happened or not — zero trust assumptions required. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/0xSisyphus/status/1415294150333841408\n\nAs builders and investors in this space, we should always be on the lookout for things that blockchains uniquely enable which cannot be done in traditional finance — algorithmic insurance could be one of them. \n\n\n# How do they work? \n\nThe easiest way to think about how these systems work is that they are a prediction market on whether or not a certain condition within a smart contract is met. For example, if you lend USDC on Compound, your USDC balance should monotonically increase over time as interest is accrued — if you are suddenly unable to claim less USDC than you originally deposited, one could infer that a smart contract exploit has occurred. Since we can check this on-chain reliably, we can then create a prediction market as to whether or not `getShares(1) > 1` [TODO: get actual function call] returns true or false. \n\nBecause Compound has never been exploited, we can imagine that most people would prefer to take the \"true\" side of the market — skewing the odds of the prediction market significantly. This creates attractive odds for the \"false\" side of the market — if by some chance Compound does get exploited they will get a huge payout, otherwise they will lose a small amount of capital. You can see how this starts to look like an insurance market, where the \"false\" bettors are paying a premium to the \"true\" bettors for a chance of a big payout if the prediction market resolves in their favor. \n\nFor more complicated DeFi protocols, we may want to define more complex payout conditions  than simply checking if a deposit token can claim > 1 underlying. For example, we could combine multiple conditions together, such as `totalAssets > x && depositShares > 1`  or even define a condition that checks the contract state over some time period, such as `totalAssets` must not decrease by more than 50% within a 10-minute window or the condition will return true. The beauty of programmable finance is that we can create arbitrarily complex payout conditions because we know for sure that the on-chain checks will execute deterministically. Furthermore, since all these payout conditions are defined on-chain, we can *always* know when a market will pay-out, no matter how complex the conditions get — it is impossible to obfuscate the risk through legal \"terms and conditions\". \n\n# Potential Pitfalls\n\nWhen users buy smart contract insurance, they simply want to get covered if a protocol gets exploited. However, it can be potentially difficult to define through code *what* an exploit actually is. For example, a classic \"rug pull\" where the creator of a liquidity pool removes all the liquidity could lead to a user holding a bag of tokens that are worth $0. Is this an exploit, or is this expected behavior for providing liquidity in an AMM? \n\nOne \"solution\" to this problem is by simply letting the free market determine which markets are the canonical insurance markets for various protocols. For example, we may be able to create two different insurance markets for Compound: the first pays out if cTokens cannot claim <1 underlying, the second pays out if cTokens cannot claim <0.5 underlying. In my opinion, it is likely that the market will naturally converge around one of the two as the \"canonical\" insurance market for Compound, maybe through Schelling points like the Compound team advocating for one or the other — letting most of the liquidity stay within one market. It could be much less \"obvious\" which market should be the canonical market for a protocol if the complexity of it is high, but this free market approach assumes that the market will sort itself out. \n\nIn this model, it matters *a lot* which specific insurance market you are a buyer or seller of. It is possible that a protocol was obviously (to the human eye) maliciously exploited, but the payout condition that your market resolves on does not get triggered. Conversely, it is possible that insurance sellers may be \"unfairly\" forced to pay out a claim if an edge case in the protocol causes the payout condition to trigger even in the absence of a malicious exploit. \n\nHence, accurate communication about what the payout conditions entail are extremely important so that insurance buyers and sellers know exactly what they are signing up for. This is mostly a UX challenge, and translating the payout conditions from code into words is a non-trivial task. Teams may be tempted to obfuscate the risks of insurance selling as \"risk-free yield\" to attract TVL, or present the products to buyers as all-encompassing smart contract insurance to boost their volumes.  \n\n\n# Beyond Insurance\n\nAlthough the market for smart contract insurance is huge, this type of protocol can also be used to create markets for exotic swaps aimed towards speculators. Changing the payout condition from things that \"should never happen\" to \"should *rarely* happen\" makes it much more interesting for speculators who are looking for asymmetric opportunities. \n\nComposability also allows developers to combine these markets in arbitrary ways, for example rehypothecating the collateral used to sell insurance in one market as collateral in a different market, letting one pool of capital sell insurance on multiple (hopefully uncorrelated) things at the same time. \n\nAlgorithmic Insurance opens up the design space significantly for interesting financial products on-chain because it is purely self-contained and does not rely on human decision making to payout. This accelerates the rate of the creation of new products, as well as allows unlimited composability/programmability — which is why we are building in DeFi in the first place.", "timestamp": 1629388507, "digest": "weX_e6CfoluZ_DZfbEFmQxbnVvjaRZf5SKkNgm1v_No", "contributor": "0xe16c0E1Bf3B75F67E83C9e47B9c0Eb8Bf1B99CCd"}

Obviously large usage numbers are good, but smaller ones aren't necessarily a sign of a product's demise.\n\nSo what happened/is happing to CryptoKitties? And can we use the answer as a litmus of health for dApps in general?\n\nA likely explanation is one of timing and now intense usage by a small number of people. Digital, collectible cats were tightly coupled to the speculation that saw crypto's astronomical rise, causing them to crash back down inline with everything else. Timing turned sour pretty quickly.\n\nCryptoKitties are still tied to the health of ETH, but might also be moving outside of the speculatory shadow cast by general crypto. Now the only people using these dApps are the ones that actually like using them. They likely aren't using CryptoKitties or another dApp as a means to get rich quick. They genuinely like digital cats or whatever.\n\nEven with DAUs in the low- to mid-hundreds, CryptoKitties sees over three thousand transactions every day. That's rabid usage for a small number of people.\n\nHaving a small number of users that absolutely love a product is much better than the opposite of having many users that are indifferent. Indifference stalls growth and creates zombie products. True fans will use the product throughout their waking hours, will think about using it when they aren't, and tell everyone they know about it.\n\nAt some point though, the true fans need to start converting others into users and the product needs to grow organically.\n\nWhen you hear people scoff at low usage numbers, it's always a good idea to take a step back and assess whether or not there are true fans present.
