{"id": "ZxArJi9b0u2EjN89x3LPCIr-VsWRGWgtbag6CnmZw6s", "title": "INTERIOR 2", "body": "There’s this funny thing that’s happened to me a few times throughout my decade-long span of releasing music as Teen Daze. I’m at the end of the project: the album’s finished and titled, the artwork, the bio, it’s all been sorted out. I’ve been working on the songs for, usually, a year or so, fine tuning and editing so that everything is just as I want it to be. Finally, I’ve gotten to the point where I can finally sit back and say “This is done.”\n\n**And it’s at this point that I realize what the record is actually about.**\n\nYou would think that that’s something I would have either known right off the bat, or at the very least figured out along the way.\n\nI *have* made records that were centred around a [cohesive](https://teendaze.bandcamp.com/album/a-silent-planet-reissue) [concept](https://teendaze.bandcamp.com/album/the-inner-mansions), but for the most part the initial creative spark leads the project in a direction. Then after I’ve seen the whole thing through, I look back and realize what I was trying to communicate the whole time.\n\nIt’s a hard feeling to pin down. I feel weirdly embarrassed by it actually, like I should have had it figured out at some point during the process, and not at the end. I’ve actually had realizations about the record I’m promoting in interviews, *while* I’m in the interview. It's always awkward. I kind of stop my answer mid-sentence and go, \"Huh, you know, I'm just realizing...\"\n\nI’m also totally confused by it. It makes me look back over the whole recording experience like it’s some distant memory. I heard one of the guys from Sigur Rós say that the time between the start of one of their performances, and the end, is just kind of a blur. Their performances are pretty intense, and they’re all pretty locked in. I guess I’m experiencing that similar sensation of being “locked in”, but over a longer period of time, with way more distractions, like, you know, living life. Very rarely have I just dedicated a big section of time to just focus on recording. Still, this feels like a good way to describe it: *that feeling when you're so focused on something, that you actually lose sense of time*.\n\n**So here I am in that position again, and the same thing is happening**.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0d3b41f7-c9f7-453f-b5a1-72af94dfb298.png?height=776&width=1188)\n\nA quick preface to where this record came from. In 2018, I was working on my last record, [Bioluminescence](https://teendaze.bandcamp.com/album/bioluminescence). It was the first record I’d had mixed by a specific mix engineer (other than [Morning World](https://teendaze.bandcamp.com/album/morning-world), which was recorded and mixed by John Vanderslice at Tiny Telephone in SF). Bioluminescence was a project where my main goal was to blend two different styles that I love: ambient music and dance music. The mix engineer I was working with was [Joel Ford](https://www.discogs.com/artist/636796-Joel-Ford?filter_anv=0&type=Credits), who I was drawn to initially from his [Ford & Lopatin](https://fordlopatin.bandcamp.com/album/channel-pressure) project (technically it was the first Games EP that made me a fan), and I learned very quickly that Joel’s ability to take my somewhat weak, muted sounds, and make them legitimately bump was pretty impressive. But like I said, half the record was on the more ambient side of things, and while he did an incredible job bringing life to those tracks, I realized I had to make a dance record for him to mix.\n \nAlmost immediately, I began writing tracks for the next record, and the first song I wrote was called Interior. I honestly don't know why I named it that. \n\nI had been listening to the Four Tet record, “New Energy” a lot, which still remains one of my favourites in his *immaculate* catalog. *(Side note: does he have the most consistent discography of any contemporary electronic artist?)* Anyways, I started recording these sequenced modular samples, like floating arpeggios, and dropping a kick underneath them, somewhat akin to what Four Tet does on some spots on New Energy. I started falling down this creative rabbit hole. \n\nI’d made dance music before, but I always tried to make dance *songs* and not dance *tracks*. That might be nonsense. What I mean is that I’d never made something that was specifically created to make people dance in a club. I never thought I had that kind of footing in the community where DJs (or at least the DJs that I liked and admired) would actually want to play my tracks. But I had this newfound confidence in knowing that Joel would take these tracks to the next level. So I thought, why not go for it. Why not try and make a dance record.\n\nOkay, so back to my original point. I knew what I wanted to make, but what ended up coming out was so much more. \n\nIn my attempt to make a record that was \"specifically for the club\", I ended up making a record that (hopefully) can serve that purpose, but also (hopefully) engages the listener's imagination.\n\nThe way that music can spark imagination is what this record is about. It’s about being 16, lying on your bed, listening to music that transports you to another place. For me, it was dance music. There was a magic that was embedded in it. I had no context for how it was made, or how it was supposed to be consumed. It opened up a new, imagined world.\n\nNow that I'm on the other side, I find myself wanting to give that experience to the listener.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9fdeef23-6898-4855-9f38-e669b693628b.png?height=812&width=1218)\n\nLet's check in on where we’re at in the actual process of the record:\n\n- The final mixes have been sent to the mastering engineer, and should hopefully be wrapped in the next few days. I'm so excited. I described it to someone the other day like this: \"I get the music to the 10 yard line. Joel scores the touchdown. The mastering engineer scores the field goal.\" Fill in your own sports metaphor here if you feel so inclined. Basically, these two roles take music that sounds as good as it can, and makes it sound better. I'm just so stoked to hear what it sounds like mastered.\n\n- We’ve received some absolutely beautiful sketches for the cover art, and have chosen the image we’re going to go with. I’m such a huge fan of this artist, and they truly did not disappoint. I like the idea that if you're reading through all of this, and learning about some of the themes of the record, you'll be able to see the album art and have it all click.\n\n- Still no conversations with the booking agent. It’s so surreal seeing so many tours and festivals being announced this week, and it’s got a bit of a fire burning under me. I guess I’m starting to imagine a world where I’ll get to visit places I love to play music I love, and it makes me pretty excited to hit the road again.\n\n- Lots more web3 convos this week. Trying to essentially plan what would be the most effective way to include this world in the world of the album. Exploring metaverse spaces, minting NFTs of album assets, and dreaming up ways to host a metaverse live show, or maybe series of chats related to web3 stuff. Having so much fun planning this aspect of it.\n\nThank you again for following along. Talk soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1621489295, "digest": "P5vQWP7CDS9KakmFd4RC8AWgTey94_EkE3R1yKCJRo4", "contributor": "0xEa83321A41c69070C971CD9Ca193366d6Be8DDC4"}

That was the pull that got me into blogging and got me investing in Twitter. It was a powerful feeling.\n\nBut a decade and a half later, it is obvious that we just replaced one type of media company for another and that we don’t really control our own media yet. I have a bit more control over this blog because I run it on my own domain using open source WordPress software, but most people are blogging on Medium or Substack or some other centralized service these days. And the social media platforms, well we know all about them in the wake of recent takedowns. You don’t control your own media platform if you run it on a centralized service.\n\nSo a few months ago, I mirrored this blog on [Mirror,](https://mirror.xyz/) a decentralized blogging platform. You can view it [here](https://avc.mirror.xyz/).\n\nAnd yesterday, I claimed @fredwilson on [Bitclout](https://bitclout.com/) with this tweet:\n\n> Claiming my Bitclout\\\n> my public address is:\\\n> BC1YLh1YEjhauU8cxmGAK59EFmGxbG65NmMrj92LfQfkjU2ZCgE7xUy[#bitclout](https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitclout?src=hash\\&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n>\n> — Fred Wilson (@fredwilson) [May 19, 2021](https://twitter.com/fredwilson/status/1394994791662882819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nAround that same time, I saw this post on Bitclout:\n\n![](https://avc.com/content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-20-at-6.34.09-AM.png)\n\nHere is the thing about blockchains and crypto – the data is public on the blockchain. Nobody controls it other than you with your private keys. And when you put open source software together with that, you get decentralized applications that nobody can mess with, not even the creators of those applications.\n\nI don’t know if Mirror is the new WordPress or if Bitclout is the new Twitter. We will see. But it sure feels like we are back in the early 2000s again, experimenting with decentralizing media. I have the same feeling of excitement I had back then.\n", "timestamp": 1621507169, "digest": "Fc_K564Sen8JMg1U8UlsMQzY6ZwGD7hpsCou3q7kSDs", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

{"id": "zmsVNybFuJtEvsam6wKtbqUbKR9YphGhFubRB64Hk6Y", "title": "Verified Personal Content", "body": "For the last 15 or so years, I've been blogging occasionally on this website.  Unfortunately, towards the end of last year, I lost control of my long-term domain name, nickgrossman-dot-is (intentionally not linking to it here).  This was a dumb mistake; I just missed the renewal notice and someone else claimed it. Painful lesson learned.  \n\nAt the time, I was bummed but figured it would just be on me to rebuild SEO to the **real** [Nick Grossman blog](https://nickgrossman.xyz/).  But, oddly, the new registrant has taken the extra step of [republishing fake versions of my old content on the site](https://twitter.com/nickgrossman/status/1369065151647911944), presumably in an attempt to retain SEO the old posts.  Notably, all of the content has been slightly modified -- just enough, I guess, to sidestep any takedown claims based on copyright infringement.\n\nSo, what started out as an annoying and unfortunate situation has taken a turn to something more ugly: at best, an attempt to farm some referral links; in the middle, a shakedown effort; and at worst, an attempt at some kind of slow-motion identity theft.\n\nAll of this has gotten me thinking about ways in which the new [decentralized media](https://avc.com/2021/05/decentralized-media/) stack can help address some of these problems.\n\nIf we look at a platform like [Mirror](http://mirror.xyz/), which is a new publishing platform built on crypto rails, there are two main components: 1) [Ethereum](http://ethereum.org/) for identity and economics, and 2) [Arweave](http://arweave.org/) for permanent data storage.  Much of the attention thus far has been focused on the first prong: economics.  Mirror's Ethereum bones mean that potentially unlimited forms of economics can be built into publications.  For example:  [Emily Segal crowdfunded a novel](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg); [Matthew Chaim is experimenting with publishing an album and a number of associated NFTs](https://chaim.mirror.xyz/0SRGluR6sYweDWV0qmgF6V1wsN0BvEKsvCVOZCFX7yU); and [Jarod Dicker is experimenting with channeling economic flows through to authors and inspirations who contributed to new content](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/yEK4DdvmxwZ2l-yHWGOQs3rMsLD6RYs_phLUzSFdhAI).  Mirror is becoming an incredible playground for the economics of content.\n\nWhile the focus on economics is really exciting, there has been less focus on the implications of the identity and perma-storage aspects of the stack.  Identities on Mirror are Ethereum wallets, and all of the content is archived -- in a verified and permanent way -- in the arweave network.\n\nWhat that means is that, for every post, there is a blockchain-verified, permanent, immutable, record of who published what, when.  Data stored in arweave cannot be changed; it can only be referenced.  Every post in Mirror creates a permanent, reference-able, linkage between the identity of the author, the time of publication, and the content of the post.  You'll notice that every post has a footer that looks like this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0b052bc0-d76f-49af-aae1-8baca1650832.png?height=172&width=557)\n\nFor my use case of a hijacked domain name and republished fake content: if I had published my original blog on Mirror/arweave, there'd be a permanent record of the real/original content.  For that to matter, though, \"the internet\" would need to learn to trust & reference the archival version of content, not modified copies.  \n\nOf course, a version of this exists today with the [Internet Archive](http://web.archive.org/), which is an invaluable resource (and presumably, the way the new owner of my domain scraped all the old content....). While the Internet Archive is an incredible resource, it has not yet become deeply linked with other forms of publishing and identity on the web.  In the case of Mirror, given the native linking between on-chain identity and content, a vibrant ecosystem is much more likely to develop around this kind of verified content.\n\nMore broadly, verified content feels like an important primitive in re-establishing trust online.  Deepfakes, identity theft, social media bots, etc -- these are all affronts to our sense of reality online, and our ability to trust platforms and people.  Just as the economic aspects of Mirror have been at the forefront so far, they have also been for crypto broadly.  \n\nWhile it's true that crypto networks introduce new forms of economics (speculation, payments, crowdfunding, etc) -- the underlying feature that enables them is trust in data.  Crypto assets have value because we trust the data systems that generate them.  I am excited that we are now starting to explore applying these same concepts to a broader set of online assets -- critically important ones: identity and content.\n\n(note: this post has been cross-posted to [Nick Grossman's blog](https://www.nickgrossman.xyz/2021/verified-personal-content/))", "timestamp": 1621523790, "digest": "yx2mj6OQw06IOXp4sb1D4XCKc8tRMIm4PKzlKV813mY", "contributor": "0xd3DD62E5ad098d2220E3921d41494fB9754c1BF1"}

By afternoon, you enter the arena to do battle. This isn’t a remake of the movie Gladiator. It’s one Anon’s day in the world of crypto games. As DeFi, NFTs and other blockchain-based technologies compete for mindshare, the entire crypto world is not only borrowing heavily from game mechanics but increasingly becoming a single massive integrated game itself. This is the inevitable result of user sovereignty. Interoperable protocols provide the freedom to move between thousands of dapps and blockchains, so developers are leaning into gamification in order to put a leash on existing users and keep them coming back for more. \n\nGame designers are, of course, experts in terms of keeping people engaged for long periods of time, even more than social media companies. Where social media companies have a recurring strategy to get someone to engage and then keep them engaged (ie. monetizing their attention through ads), games are different. Games look to draw you in at an initial (often free) engagement, but then encourage you to build status and identity within the experience itself. Mapping all this to crypto is easy. The users make purchases (see: NFTs) that make your social involvement (see: social tokens) unique. The experience blends intrinsic and extrinsic incentives to keep you invested (financially & socially) in the experience itself.\n\nDespite this focus on gamification however, crypto games continue to struggle with designing exciting game mechanics that both drive long term engagement and live up to the decentralized and democratic ideals of the blockchain. Even the most popular games such as CryptoKitties and Top Shots have fairly similar bell-shaped curves in terms of transaction volumes and DAUs. We see significant concentration with limited adoption by broader groups participating at a fairly skewed playtime.\n\nWhy is this? Well, for the most part, cryptogames are borrowing pay-to-win and other non-meritocratic game mechanics instead of building the accomplishment loops that drive user/player delight, long-term engagement and mass adoption. They reward power users and big spenders, leading to a cycle of ‘rich getting richer.’ All this is based on non-skill-based mechanics that reward wallet size above all else. For example, users who buy rich assets are granted future potential benefits (more inflation, more exclusive opportunities to purchase in early sales) leading to them getting richer and putting themself further ahead. That’s not to say there aren’t success stories -- nor opportunities for skill, hard work and grinding to be rewarded -- but until the ecosystem learns to adapt the best of games, by rewarding all kinds of human capabilities, it cannot reach its full potential.\n\n**Cities & Culture**\n\n[In Economic Flows & Cultural Products](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/yEK4DdvmxwZ2l-yHWGOQs3rMsLD6RYs_phLUzSFdhAI), we discussed how the path of protocol and creator (ie. DAOs) adopting will mirror the growth of culture in our first cities. That is to say, culture and creation via patronage and communal backing. Ironically, games were one of the first major applications and products built by crypto enthusiasts looking to drive greater adoption and mass participation in their new decentralized economy. In 2018, many of the biggest NFT marketplaces (OpenSea and Bitski) went all-in on crypto games as many proclaimed they were the future of crypto adoption and that crypto was the future of gaming. \n\nThis made sense. Gaming was already one of the most popular activities in the digital world, with significant overlap between the crypto and gamer audiences. And looking at the example of both Facebook and mobile, it was evident how important the rise of platform-specialized games had been to the popularity of those platforms. On top of that, gaming seemed like a particularly perfect fit for decentralized technology. Players have long been used to purchasing digital goods and participating in digital economies, with a natural belief that games ought to allow players more freedom and control over their virtual possessions. Vitalik Buterin has credited Blizzard’s arbitrary destruction of his World of Warcraft Siphon Life Spell as impetus to create Ethereum. \n\nThree years later, despite all these efforts and focus, crypto games still haven’t seen anything like the viral adoption we saw within Facebook and mobile. Most remain much more like speculative investment vehicles than entertainment hits. And with high gas fees and challenges in scalability and infrastructure, the player ranks remain small and concentrated.\n\nThere are several reasons why crypto games haven’t scaled to mass adoption-- \n\n- **Platform**: platform issues remain rampant. Today there are high transaction costs and problems with scalability, problems that would be even worse if user bases and demand were bigger. Plus there are big ugly unavoidable questions regarding the benefits of decentralization to the high-twitch vivid environments many serious gamers demand. \n\n- “**Revenue**”: business models remain challenged and misaligned. Today the opportunity for game-makers to earn a SHIT-TON of money from sale of land and items leads them to maximize these types of products -- this can make the core of the game suffer from ‘asset inequality,’ an experience too expensive for entry-level players, and a sort of preening Yuppie-ness that isn’t that cool.\n\n- **Immersion**: there is insufficient immersion - the crypto-ness of the games (many are thinly veiled yield farming) and interoperability of assets across games into marketplaces reduces the game’s intensity and believability and its sense of place and escape.\n\nMore importantly though, crypto games are competing with DeFi itself and, in that, often losing. If the game is just thinly veiled speculation and/or yield farming, why not just do that with the thousands of fun tokens minus the game pretext? It may actually be simpler to play the purer version, and, with the addition of social media group behaviors, even more fun.\n\n> DeFi is a more accessible game than crypto games and the rules can’t be changed by any single entity. \n\nIt’s possible that, because the use of the blockchain for the trading of digital assets as NFTs is so obvious (and lucrative) that crypto game designers have missed the larger possibilities of decentralization. Rather than centering their communities on competitions of cooperation and creativity, we get shallow status contests and themed casinos. And incentives can be seriously mis-aligned. With crypto games, the original creator can mint more NFTs at any point which causes inflation. \n\nThere’s no question that videogames have a God-dictator that determines the story, controls the economy, and tries to create the best possible experience. This helps make the games more fun and playable by altering the “meta” and ensuring playability and balance. This authority may be camouflaged in games, but it's always there. And it is essential to how successful games work. DeFi, in comparison, is competing 'games' (blockchains and dapps) within a metagame (the game of token vs token), with nobody in charge, or perhaps lots of people in charge. In the world of crypto, everything and nothing is a game at the same time. \n\nIn many ways, the problems facing crypto games reflect the inherent tension between those aspects of a game that ‘want’ to be decentralized and those better or more easily accomplished by a centralized solution. The development and management of innovative gameplay experiences, complex storyworlds and game economies are simply easier in a centralized setting. New crypto users, with their need for fiat and customer service, make this problem even more acute. Perhaps the two most popular gateways to crypto, Coinbase and Dapper’s TopShots, accepted the need for a compromise, but it is often an uncomfortable synthesis. The disruptive capabilities and ambitions of crypto sit restlessly within a bounded environment, like a caged wild animal looking for its opportunity to escape and wreak havoc. How to bridge this gap? Everyone agrees, to use the most common example, that it would be awesome if Fortnite enabled you to buy and sell and use Fortnite stuff outside of Fortnite. But that stuff is only valuable because Fortnite is awesome, and that awesomeness is the product of a highly managed environment. That's not to say we will never build decentralized systems and governance for a thing like Fortnite. We can and will eventually have Creator DAOs that build and run worlds. But we're not yet very close to being able to do that. And until then, we will mainly have crypto games that are more DeFi than delightful, more on-ramp to the blockchain than an engrossing destination.\n", "timestamp": 1621528139, "digest": "q7IvhRxSux5fk41ZDCEUm3uucmqZybvVBxByceRbFV4", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}

The final version of the song with your verse on it will then be released as a 1/1 Catalog NFT and, eventually, on the Textures OF A Long Forgotten Assumption album release on streaming platforms. \n\n**The winner will also receive this 1/1 collectible NFT of Flavors, as well as 10% of the master’s future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties etc).**\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:1012987:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\n## **Track no. 8 — *Paint***\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/1012935)\n\nThe song *Paint* is still in a very early demo stage. In fact, I don’t yet have a chorus for it. I wrote the beginnings of this song with Danny Majic, and have always loved the first verse and pre-chorus. But there is still a ways to go on this song, and I am looking for 1 partner to join along for the ride. \n\nThis partner will be the ***creative director*** for the song *Paint* — and this role can look many different ways. Perhaps you’re a musician and can help with the songwriting or production of the song, perhaps you’re visual artists and can help on the visual side. Perhaps you don’t consider yourself an artist whatsoever, but can help on the outreach and marketing side. Perhaps you just want to get a closer look into the makings of a song, and just want to take pictures of the process on your disposable camera. Whatever it may be! This creative director position is yours to fill however you choose, should you win it of course. \n\nNow, how do you win it?\n\nThe *Paint* collectible is a 1/1 NFT on Rarible, and is up for **Silent Auction**. \n\nYes, that’s correct. Silent Auction. \n\nTo win this auction, you must email me your bid. \n\nThat’s correct. Email me your bid at paintauctionbid@gmail.com. \n\nYour bid can be in ETH, it can be in USD, it can be in CAD, or DOGE or WRITE or any other currency on the planet. It can also be a non-currency bid! It can be a barter of some kind — maybe a good or maybe a service. Anything! Get creative! \n\nThis is for the role of creative director on the song. So show me your creativity. And show me how much you want it. :)\n\nOnce the first bid is in, a 24-hour countdown will commence. I will announce updates on the Silent Auction in real-time on [twitter](https://twitter.com/matthewchaim). \n\n**The winner will be the official creative director for *Paint*, win this 1/1 collectible NFT, and receive 10% of the master’s future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties etc).**\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:1012935:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\n### **Track no. 9 — *Untitled***\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430/572927)\n\n1 creative director is great. But what about 100? \n\nYes, that’s correct. 100 creative directors. \n\nThat is what I am in search of for this last song on the album, which does not yet even have a name. As you can see, we have our work cut out for ourselves. \n\nIn fact, I’m not even sure which demo on mine should be the 9th and final song on the project. There are a few options that I really love, but I need your help to decide on which one to pursue. That is where we will start our collective decision making. Here’s how it works:\n\nThe Untitled collectible is a **100 edition** NFT on [Rarible](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details), with each edition priced at **0.03 ETH**. I ask that you purchase a maximum of **1 edition per wallet**. \n\nThe Untitled collectible NFT will act as the access token into a gated set of channels on the Homemade Universe discord, where this community of 100 people will convene and begin the creative direction of the song. \n\n**Each edition represents 1 vote in the *Untitled Creative Director DAO* that will be formed to govern the completion of this final song of the album, as well as 0.1% of the master’s future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties, etc). This means that 100 people will together own 10% of the song’s final master.**\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\n# THE COPIES\n\nThe final form this album is being released today is with **1000 album bundle copies**, [available for purchase on my online shop here](https://ko-fi.com/s/794a026bac). \n\nThis bundle comes with:\n1. the first 7 tracks off the album, including *Flavors* with the empty second verse\n2. 8 pieces of album artwork\n3. one (1) invitation to *Homemade Universe*\n4. one (1) entry into the *Flavors Feature Contest* (more info in the Collectibles section above\n\nAfter your purchase, you will receive an access card into the Homemade Universe discord — which will give you access to the private set of channels available to members. \n\nThe album bundle will be available for up to two weeks or up to 1000 copies, whichever comes first. \n\n**You can [purchase an album bundle copy here](https://ko-fi.com/s/794a026bac).**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f29b829a-3e2e-4aba-aee9-2ab41f399355.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\n# A Super Short Recap \n\nMy album *Textures Of A Long Forgotten Assumption* drops today, but not on streaming platforms. \n\nThe full album is made up of 9 songs. 6 of them are done. 3 of them aren’t. I need your help to finish the project. \n\nYou can participate in the drop through 3 form factors:\n1. The Canon → 4 one-of-one Catalog song NFTs + 1 one-of-one Zora music video NFT\n2. The Collectibles → 9 vinyl NFTs available on Rarible, each with their own mechanics baked in\n3. The Copies → 1000 album bundle copies available on my online shop\n\nAll of these give you access to:\n\n1. a private download of the album’s songs and artwork\n2. one (1) invitation into the *Homemade Universe* discord server — my private online community\n3. one (1) entry into the *Flavors Feature Contest*. (more info on this in the *Collectibles* section)\n\n# A Final Thought \n\nIn building this release out, I realized I missed one more word in my cute little alliteration. \n\nThe full phrase should go → Canon, Collectibles, Copies, and *Community*. \n\nThis project in some ways only *begins* today, in that it is the first page in our story of exploring collective creation together. For the final 3 songs, we will begin a new journey of seeing what it is like for a community to create together in 3 very different ways — one as a contest, one as a 1-to-1 relationship, and 1 as a DAO making decisions together. It is also the beginning of exploring the possibilities around sharing in the equity of our co-creations in this way. \n\nThe other thing you may notice in the split blocks below, is my private community Homemade Universe is receiving 5% of all auction revenues. Those funds will go into a shared treasury controlled by the community, which we will use for future co-creative projects together. \n\nI’m incredibly excited to go on this new journey with you. And learn what it means to bring together like-minded individuals around my art, and create real value together. \n\nThis is just the beginning. \n\nThanks for being here. 🌻\n\n", "timestamp": 1621544756, "digest": "9EAsxtkQD6hIQJLDID5w8Jn6o_m9Bw4XnDdTwOVHttA", "contributor": "0x5090c4Fead5Be112b643BC75d61bF42339675448"}

What happens when we do? \n\nThe release of this project aims to rip open some of those deeply held beliefs we have around music — what music is, how we value it, and how it’s “supposed to be” distributed. \n\nThis release is broken down into 3 sections: **The Canon, The Collectibles, and The Copies**. *To learn more about my thoughts behind this release mix, [read my previous essay](https://chaim.mirror.xyz/0SRGluR6sYweDWV0qmgF6V1wsN0BvEKsvCVOZCFX7yU).* \n\n### Here’s what’s happening:\n\n- There are 5 one-of-one *canon*ical NFTs on auction below\n- There are 9 NFT *collectibles* now available on Rarible, which are walked through in detail below \n- There are 1000 album bundle *copies* available for purchase on my online shop, also walked through below \n\n### All collectors of any of the above will receive: \n\n- a private download of the album’s songs and artwork\n- one (1) invitation into the *Homemade Universe* discord server — my private online community. \n- one (1) entry into the *Flavors Feature Contest*. more on this below. \n\n## The full *Textures Of A Long Forgotten Assumption* tracklist is:\n1.

There is also a one-of-one Zora NFT for the official *Form* music video, auctioning off on Zora. \n\nYou can see who the recipients are for each of the 4 Catalog NFTs being auctioned below. These are the collaborators (writers, producers, engineers) I created this music with. \n\nAs you can see, 5% of funds received are going towards my private community *Homemade Universe*’s shared treasury. These funds will be used in future co-creative projects together. Since all collectors + purchasers gain access to *Homemade Universe*, 5% of this project’s proceeds are funnelling into a community that you are co-creator and co-owner of. \n\n## Track No. 3 — Sand\n\n*Sand* is written by Danny Majic + myself, and produced by Danny Majic.\n\nThis was the first song Danny and I ever wrote together, the very day we met each other. This was also the very first song I wrote after a 10-day cross-country solo drive from Montreal, Canada to Los Angeles, California. \n\n[Token #3166](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3166)\n\n## Track No. 4 — Red Balloons\n\n*Red Balloons* is written by Hayley Gene Penner, Jason Yik Nam Wu + myself, and produced by Rabitt.\n\nThis is the first song I've ever released with a co-written top-line. I've always found it difficult to write lyrics and melody with others, but Hayley is a great friend and we truly found a shared energy on this one. And Rabitt always brings the goods. \n\n[Token #3167](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3167)\n\n## Track No. 5 — Crazy\n\n*Crazy* is written by Danny Majic + myself, and produced by Danny Majic.\n\nWe wrote this song together at a songwriting camp in Nashville, Tennessee.

Attached to said studio was the very house we were both living in at the time. This was the last song we wrote together, before I left for Montreal when the pandemic began. A version of the song was first released on streaming platforms in May 2020, on a charity album raising money for MusiCares' Covid Relief Fund. \n\n[Token #3169](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3169)\n\n## Form — The Official Music Video \n\nThe official music video for \"Form\" is [**now up for auction on Zora**](https://zora.co/chaim/3172), filmed + edited by myself while stuck in a quarantine hotel in Montreal in May 2020. 🥽\n\n*Form* is written by Jason Yik Nam Wu + myself, and produced by Rabitt.\n\nThe reserve bid is 0.5 ETH.

Hence, the ***Flavors Feature Contest***. Anyone who collects an NFT or purchases an album bundle copy receives one (1) entry into the contest. \n\nAfter your purchase and/or collection, you’ll receive a private download of the album.

There is also a one-of-one Zora NFT for the official *Form* music video, auctioning off on Zora. \n\nYou can see who the recipients are for each of the 4 Catalog NFTs being auctioned below. These are the collaborators (writers, producers, engineers) I created this music with. \n\nAs you can see, 5% of funds received are going towards my private community *Homemade Universe*’s shared treasury. These funds will be used in future co-creative projects together.

I've always found it difficult to write lyrics and melody with others, but Hayley is a great friend and we truly found a shared energy on this one.

Attached to said studio was the very house we were both living in at the time. This was the last song we wrote together, before I left for Montreal when the pandemic began.

Hence, the ***Flavors Feature Contest***. Anyone who collects an NFT or purchases an album bundle copy receives one (1) entry into the contest. \n\nAfter your purchase and/or collection, you’ll receive a private download of the album. Included will be an mp3 of Flavors with an open second verse. You can use that file to start writing your verse. You will also gain access to the Homemade Universe discord server, where you will be able to submit your version of Flavors. Submissions will close on June 20 2021. \n\nA winner will then be chosen to be the official feature of Flavors. The final version of the song with your verse on it will then be released as a 1/1 Catalog NFT and, eventually, on the Textures OF A Long Forgotten Assumption album release on streaming platforms. \n\n**The winner will also receive this 1/1 collectible NFT of Flavors, as well as 10% of the master’s future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties etc).**\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:1012987:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\n## **Track no. 8 — *Paint***\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/1012935)\n\nThe song *Paint* is still in a very early demo stage. In fact, I don’t yet have a chorus for it. I wrote the beginnings of this song with Danny Majic, and have always loved the first verse and pre-chorus. But there is still a ways to go on this song, and I am looking for 1 partner to join along for the ride. \n\nThis partner will be the ***creative director*** for the song *Paint* — and this role can look many different ways. Perhaps you’re a musician and can help with the songwriting or production of the song, perhaps you’re visual artists and can help on the visual side. Perhaps you don’t consider yourself an artist whatsoever, but can help on the outreach and marketing side. Perhaps you just want to get a closer look into the makings of a song, and just want to take pictures of the process on your disposable camera. Whatever it may be! This creative director position is yours to fill however you choose, should you win it of course. \n\nNow, how do you win it?\n\nThe *Paint* collectible is a 1/1 NFT on Rarible, and is up for **Silent Auction**. \n\nYes, that’s correct. Silent Auction. \n\nTo win this auction, you must email me your bid. \n\nThat’s correct. Email me your bid at paintauctionbid@gmail.com. \n\nYour bid can be in ETH, it can be in USD, it can be in CAD, or DOGE or WRITE or any other currency on the planet. It can also be a non-currency bid! It can be a barter of some kind — maybe a good or maybe a service. Anything! Get creative! \n\nThis is for the role of creative director on the song. So show me your creativity. And show me how much you want it. :)\n\nOnce the first bid is in, a 24-hour countdown will commence. I will announce updates on the Silent Auction in real-time on [twitter](https://twitter.com/matthewchaim). \n\n**The winner will be the official creative director for *Paint*, win this 1/1 collectible NFT, and receive 10% of the master’s future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties etc).**\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:1012935:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\n### **Track no. 9 — *Untitled***\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430/572927)\n\n1 creative director is great. But what about 100? \n\nYes, that’s correct. 100 creative directors. \n\nThat is what I am in search of for this last song on the album, which does not yet even have a name. As you can see, we have our work cut out for ourselves. \n\nIn fact, I’m not even sure which demo on mine should be the 9th and final song on the project. There are a few options that I really love, but I need your help to decide on which one to pursue. That is where we will start our collective decision making. Here’s how it works:\n\nThe Untitled collectible is a **100 edition** NFT on [Rarible](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details), with each edition priced at **0.03 ETH**. I ask that you purchase a maximum of **1 edition per wallet**. \n\nThe Untitled collectible NFT will act as the access token into a gated set of channels on the Homemade Universe discord, where this community of 100 people will convene and begin the creative direction of the song. \n\n**Each edition represents 1 vote in the *Untitled Creative Director DAO* that will be formed to govern the completion of this final song of the album, as well as 0.1% of the master’s future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties, etc). This means that 100 people will together own 10% of the song’s final master.**\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\n# THE COPIES\n\nThe final form this album is being released today is with **1000 album bundle copies**, [available for purchase on my online shop here](https://ko-fi.com/s/794a026bac). \n\nThis bundle comes with:\n1. the first 7 tracks off the album, including *Flavors* with the empty second verse\n2. 8 pieces of album artwork\n3. one (1) invitation to *Homemade Universe*\n4. one (1) entry into the *Flavors Feature Contest* (more info in the Collectibles section above\n\nAfter your purchase, you will receive an access card into the Homemade Universe discord — which will give you access to the private set of channels available to members. \n\nThe album bundle will be available for up to two weeks or up to 1000 copies, whichever comes first. \n\n**You can [purchase an album bundle copy here](https://ko-fi.com/s/794a026bac).**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f29b829a-3e2e-4aba-aee9-2ab41f399355.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\n# A Super Short Recap \n\nMy album *Textures Of A Long Forgotten Assumption* drops today, but not on streaming platforms. \n\nThe full album is made up of 9 songs. 6 of them are done. 3 of them aren’t. I need your help to finish the project. \n\nYou can participate in the drop through 3 form factors:\n1. The Canon → 4 one-of-one Catalog song NFTs + 1 one-of-one Zora music video NFT\n2. The Collectibles → 9 vinyl NFTs available on Rarible, each with their own mechanics baked in\n3. The Copies → 1000 album bundle copies available on my online shop\n\nAll of these give you access to:\n\n1. a private download of the album’s songs and artwork\n2. one (1) invitation into the *Homemade Universe* discord server — my private online community\n3. one (1) entry into the *Flavors Feature Contest*. (more info on this in the *Collectibles* section)\n\n# A Final Thought \n\nIn building this release out, I realized I missed one more word in my cute little alliteration. \n\nThe full phrase should go → Canon, Collectibles, Copies, and *Community*. \n\nThis project in some ways only *begins* today, in that it is the first page in our story of exploring collective creation together. For the final 3 songs, we will begin a new journey of seeing what it is like for a community to create together in 3 very different ways — one as a contest, one as a 1-to-1 relationship, and 1 as a DAO making decisions together. It is also the beginning of exploring the possibilities around sharing in the equity of our co-creations in this way. \n\nThe other thing you may notice in the split blocks below, is my private community Homemade Universe is receiving 5% of all auction revenues. Those funds will go into a shared treasury controlled by the community, which we will use for future co-creative projects together. \n\nI’m incredibly excited to go on this new journey with you. And learn what it means to bring together like-minded individuals around my art, and create real value together. \n\nThis is just the beginning. \n\nThanks for being here. 🌻", "timestamp": 1621546167, "digest": "9EAsxtkQD6hIQJLDID5w8Jn6o_m9Bw4XnDdTwOVHttA", "contributor": "0x5090c4Fead5Be112b643BC75d61bF42339675448"}

Included will be an mp3 of Flavors with an open second verse. You can use that file to start writing your verse.

In fact, I don’t yet have a chorus for it. I wrote the beginnings of this song with Danny Majic, and have always loved the first verse and pre-chorus. But there is still a ways to go on this song, and I am looking for 1 partner to join along for the ride. \n\nThis partner will be the ***creative director*** for the song *Paint* — and this role can look many different ways. Perhaps you’re a musician and can help with the songwriting or production of the song, perhaps you’re visual artists and can help on the visual side. Perhaps you don’t consider yourself an artist whatsoever, but can help on the outreach and marketing side. Perhaps you just want to get a closer look into the makings of a song, and just want to take pictures of the process on your disposable camera. Whatever it may be! This creative director position is yours to fill however you choose, should you win it of course. \n\nNow, how do you win it?\n\nThe *Paint* collectible is a 1/1 NFT on Rarible, and is up for **Silent Auction**. \n\nYes, that’s correct. Silent Auction. \n\nTo win this auction, you must email me your bid. \n\nThat’s correct. Email me your bid at paintauctionbid@gmail.com. \n\nYour bid can be in ETH, it can be in USD, it can be in CAD, or DOGE or WRITE or any other currency on the planet. It can also be a non-currency bid! It can be a barter of some kind — maybe a good or maybe a service. Anything! Get creative! \n\nThis is for the role of creative director on the song. So show me your creativity. And show me how much you want it. :)\n\nOnce the first bid is in, a 24-hour countdown will commence. I will announce updates on the Silent Auction in real-time on [twitter](https://twitter.com/matthewchaim). \n\n**The winner will be the official creative director for *Paint*, win this 1/1 collectible NFT, and receive 10% of the master’s future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties etc).**\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:1012935:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\n### **Track no. 9 — *Untitled*** + the *Untitled Creative Director DAO*\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430/572927)\n\nGrab your [entry NFT into the *Untitled Creative Director DAO* here](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details).\n\n1 creative director is great. But what about 100? \n\nYes, that’s correct. 100 creative directors. \n\nThat is what I am in search of for this last song on the album, which does not yet even have a name. As you can see, we have our work cut out for ourselves. \n\nIn fact, I’m not even sure which demo on mine should be the 9th and final song on the project. There are a few options that I really love, but I need your help to decide on which one to pursue. That is where we will start our collective decision making. Here’s how it works:\n\nThe Untitled collectible is a **100 edition** NFT on [Rarible](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details), with each edition priced at **0.03 ETH**. I ask that you purchase a maximum of **1 edition per wallet**. \n\nThe Untitled collectible NFT will act as the access token into a gated set of channels on the Homemade Universe discord, where this community of 100 people will convene and begin the creative direction of the song. \n\n**Each edition represents 1 vote in the *Untitled Creative Director DAO* that will be formed to govern the completion of this final song of the album, as well as 0.1% of the master’s future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties, etc).

I need your help to finish the project. \n\nYou can participate in the drop through 3 form factors:\n1. The Canon → 4 one-of-one Catalog song NFTs + 1 one-of-one Zora music video NFT\n2. The Collectibles → 9 vinyl NFTs available on Rarible, each with their own mechanics baked in\n3. The Copies → 1000 album bundle copies available on my online shop\n\nAll of these give you access to:\n\n1. a private download of the album’s songs and artwork\n2. one (1) invitation into the *Homemade Universe* discord server — my private online community\n3. one (1) entry into the *Flavors Feature Contest*. (more info on this in the *Collectibles* section)\n\n# A Final Thought \n\nIn building this release out, I realized I missed one more word in my cute little alliteration. \n\nThe full phrase should go → Canon, Collectibles, Copies, and *Community*. \n\nThis project in some ways only *begins* today, in that it is the first page in our story of exploring collective creation together. For the final 3 songs, we will begin a new journey of seeing what it is like for a community to create together in 3 very different ways — one as a contest, one as a 1-to-1 relationship, and 1 as a DAO making decisions together. It is also the beginning of exploring the possibilities around sharing in the equity of our co-creations in this way. \n\nThe other thing you may notice in the splits delineated in the *Canon* NFTs above, is my private community Homemade Universe is receiving 5% of all auction revenues. Those funds will go into a shared treasury controlled by the community, which we will use for future co-creative projects together. \n\nI’m incredibly excited to go on this new journey with you. And learn what it means to bring together like-minded individuals around my art, and create real value together. \n\nThis is just the beginning. \n\nThanks for being here. 🌻", "timestamp": 1621551334, "digest": "9EAsxtkQD6hIQJLDID5w8Jn6o_m9Bw4XnDdTwOVHttA", "contributor": "0x5090c4Fead5Be112b643BC75d61bF42339675448"}

What happens when we do? \n\nThe release of this project aims to rip open some of those deeply held beliefs we have around music — what music is, how we value it, and how it’s “supposed to be” distributed. \n\nThis release is broken down into 3 sections: **The Canon, The Collectibles, and The Copies**. *To learn more about my thoughts behind this release mix, [read my previous essay](https://chaim.mirror.xyz/0SRGluR6sYweDWV0qmgF6V1wsN0BvEKsvCVOZCFX7yU).* \n\n### Here’s what’s happening:\n\n- There are 5 one-of-one *canon*ical NFTs on auction **below**\n- There are 9 NFT *collectibles* now [**available on Rarible**](https://rarible.com/chaim), which are walked through in detail below \n- There are 1000 album bundle *copies* [**now available on my online shop**](https://ko-fi.com/s/794a026bac), also walked through below \n\n### All collectors of any of the above will receive: \n\n- a private download of the *Textures Of A Long Forgotten Assumptions* album's songs and artwork\n- one (1) invitation into the *Homemade Universe* discord server — my private online community. \n- one (1) entry into the *Flavors Feature Contest*.

Paint (unfinished)\n9. Untitled (unfinished)\n\nAs you can see, **three of the nine songs are unfinished**. I need your help to finish them, and you can see how in the *Collectibles* section below. \n\nLet’s begin...\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/406d2f77-5164-4980-8fc6-e991ed8bfdc9.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\n\n# THE CANON\n\nOn auction are 4 one-of-one Catalog NFT for tracks 3 thru 6 — *Sand*, *Red Balloons*, *Crazy* and *Island*. There is also a one-of-one Zora NFT for the official *Form* music video, auctioning off on Zora. \n\nYou can see who the recipients are for each of the 4 Catalog NFTs being auctioned below. These are the collaborators (writers, producers, engineers) I created this music with. \n\n## Track No. 3 — Sand\n\n*Sand* is written by Danny Majic + myself, and produced by Danny Majic.\n\nThis was the first song Danny and I ever wrote together, the very day we met each other. This was also the very first song I wrote after a 10-day cross-country solo drive from Montreal, Canada to Los Angeles, California. \n\n[Token #3166](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3166)\n\n## Track No. 4 — Red Balloons\n\n*Red Balloons* is written by Hayley Gene Penner, Jason Yik Nam Wu + myself, and produced by Rabitt.\n\nThis is the first song I've ever released with a co-written top-line. I've always found it difficult to write lyrics and melody with others, but Hayley is a great friend and we truly found a shared energy on this one. And Rabitt always brings the goods. \n\n[Token #3167](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3167)\n\n## Track No. 5 — Crazy\n\n*Crazy* is written by Danny Majic + myself, and produced by Danny Majic.\n\nWe wrote this song together at a songwriting camp in Nashville, Tennessee. It was the first ever *Really Fun Camp* organized by Rabitt. \n\n[Token #3168](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3168)\n\n## Track No. 6 — Island\n\n*Island* is written by Jason Yik Nam Wu + myself, and produced by Rabitt.\n\nWe wrote this song together in Jason's studio in Silverlake, Los Angeles. Attached to said studio was the very house we were both living in at the time. This was the last song we wrote together, before I left for Montreal when the pandemic began. A version of the song was first released on streaming platforms in May 2020, on a charity album raising money for MusiCares' Covid Relief Fund. \n\n[Token #3169](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3169)\n\nAs you can see in the auctions above above, **5% of funds received are going towards my private community *Homemade Universe*’s shared treasury**. These funds will be used in future co-creative projects together. Since all collectors + purchasers gain access to *Homemade Universe*, 5% of this project’s proceeds are funnelling into a community that you are co-creator and co-owner of. \n\n## Form — The Official Music Video \n\nThe official music video for \"Form\" is [**now up for auction on Zora**](https://zora.co/chaim/3172), filmed + edited by myself while stuck in a quarantine hotel in Montreal in May 2020. 🥽\n\n*Form* is written by Jason Yik Nam Wu + myself, and produced by Rabitt.\n\nThe reserve bid is 0.5 ETH.

This means that 100 people will together own 10% of the song’s final master.**\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\n# THE COPIES\n\nThe final form this album is being released today is with **1000 album bundle copies**, [available for purchase on my online shop here](https://ko-fi.com/s/794a026bac). \n\nThis bundle comes with:\n1. the first 7 tracks off the album, including *Flavors* with the empty second verse\n2. 8 pieces of album artwork\n3. one (1) invitation to *Homemade Universe*\n4. one (1) entry into the *Flavors Feature Contest* (more info in the Collectibles section above\n\nAfter your purchase, you will receive an access card into the Homemade Universe discord — which will give you access to the private set of channels available to members. \n\nThe album bundle will be available for up to two weeks or up to 1000 copies, whichever comes first. \n\n**You can [purchase an album bundle copy here](https://ko-fi.com/s/794a026bac).**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f29b829a-3e2e-4aba-aee9-2ab41f399355.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\n# A Super Short Recap \n\nMy album *Textures Of A Long Forgotten Assumption* drops today, but not on streaming platforms. \n\nThe full album is made up of 9 songs. 6 of them are done. 3 of them aren’t. I need your help to finish the project. \n\nYou can participate in the drop through 3 form factors:\n1. The Canon → 4 one-of-one Catalog song NFTs + 1 one-of-one Zora music video NFT\n2. The Collectibles → 9 vinyl NFTs available on Rarible, each with their own mechanics baked in\n3. The Copies → 1000 album bundle copies available on my online shop\n\nAll of these give you access to:\n\n1. a private download of the album’s songs and artwork\n2. one (1) invitation into the *Homemade Universe* discord server — my private online community\n3. one (1) entry into the *Flavors Feature Contest*. (more info on this in the *Collectibles* section)\n\n# A Final Thought \n\nIn building this release out, I realized I missed one more word in my cute little alliteration. \n\nThe full phrase should go → Canon, Collectibles, Copies, and *Community*. \n\nThis project in some ways only *begins* today, in that it is the first page in our story of exploring collective creation together. For the final 3 songs, we will begin a new journey of seeing what it is like for a community to create together in 3 very different ways — one as a contest, one as a 1-to-1 relationship, and 1 as a DAO making decisions together. It is also the beginning of exploring the possibilities around sharing in the equity of our co-creations in this way. \n\nThe other thing you may notice in the splits delineated in the *Canon* NFTs above, is my private community Homemade Universe is receiving 5% of all auction revenues. Those funds will go into a shared treasury controlled by the community, which we will use for future co-creative projects together. \n\nI’m incredibly excited to go on this new journey with you. And learn what it means to bring together like-minded individuals around my art, and create real value together. \n\nThis is just the beginning. \n\nThanks for being here. 🌻", "timestamp": 1621552808, "digest": "9EAsxtkQD6hIQJLDID5w8Jn6o_m9Bw4XnDdTwOVHttA", "contributor": "0x5090c4Fead5Be112b643BC75d61bF42339675448"}

What happens when we do? \n\nThe release of this project aims to rip open some of those deeply held beliefs we have around music — what music is, how we value it, and how it’s “supposed to be” distributed. \n\nThis release is broken down into 3 sections: **The Canon, The Collectibles, and The Copies**. *To learn more about my thoughts behind this release mix, [read my previous essay](https://chaim.mirror.xyz/0SRGluR6sYweDWV0qmgF6V1wsN0BvEKsvCVOZCFX7yU).* \n\n### Here’s what’s happening:\n\n- There are 5 one-of-one *canon*ical NFTs on auction **below**\n- There are 9 NFT *collectibles* now [**available on Rarible**](https://rarible.com/chaim), which are walked through in detail below \n- There are 1000 album bundle *copies* [**now available on my online shop**](https://ko-fi.com/s/794a026bac), also walked through below \n\n### All collectors of any of the above will receive: \n\n- a private download of the *Textures Of A Long Forgotten Assumptions* album's songs and artwork\n- one (1) invitation into the *Homemade Universe* discord server — my private online community. \n- one (1) entry into the *Flavors Feature Contest*. More on this below. \n\n## The full *Textures Of A Long Forgotten Assumption* tracklist is:\n1. Form\n2. Tear\n3. Sand\n4. Red Balloons\n5. Crazy\n6. Island\n7. Flavors (unfinished)\n8. Paint (unfinished)\n9. Untitled (unfinished)\n\nAs you can see, **three of the nine songs are unfinished**. I need your help to finish them, and you can see how in the *Collectibles* section below. \n\nLet’s begin...\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/406d2f77-5164-4980-8fc6-e991ed8bfdc9.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\n\n# THE CANON\n\nOn auction are 4 one-of-one [Catalog NFTs](https://beta.catalog.works/chaim) for tracks 3 thru 6 — *Sand*, *Red Balloons*, *Crazy* and *Island*. There is also a one-of-one Zora NFT for the official *Form* music video, auctioning off on Zora. \n\nYou can see who the recipients are for each of the 4 Catalog NFTs being auctioned below. These are the collaborators (writers, producers, engineers) I created this music with. \n\n## Track No. 3 — Sand\n\n*Sand* is written by Danny Majic + myself, and produced by Danny Majic.\n\nThis was the first song Danny and I ever wrote together, the very day we met each other. This was also the very first song I wrote after a 10-day cross-country solo drive from Montreal, Canada to Los Angeles, California. \n\n[Token #3166](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3166)\n\n## Track No. 4 — Red Balloons\n\n*Red Balloons* is written by Hayley Gene Penner, Jason Yik Nam Wu + myself, and produced by Rabitt.\n\nThis is the first song I've ever released with a co-written top-line. I've always found it difficult to write lyrics and melody with others, but Hayley is a great friend and we truly found a shared energy on this one. And Rabitt always brings the goods. \n\n[Token #3167](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3167)\n\n## Track No. 5 — Crazy\n\n*Crazy* is written by Danny Majic + myself, and produced by Danny Majic.\n\nWe wrote this song together at a songwriting camp in Nashville, Tennessee. It was the first ever *Really Fun Camp* organized by Rabitt. \n\n[Token #3168](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3168)\n\n## Track No. 6 — Island\n\n*Island* is written by Jason Yik Nam Wu + myself, and produced by Rabitt.\n\nWe wrote this song together in Jason's studio in Silverlake, Los Angeles. Attached to said studio was the very house we were both living in at the time. This was the last song we wrote together, before I left for Montreal when the pandemic began. A version of the song was first released on streaming platforms in May 2020, on a charity album raising money for MusiCares' Covid Relief Fund. \n\n[Token #3169](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3169)\n\nAs you can see in the auctions above above, **5% of funds received are going towards my private community *Homemade Universe*’s shared treasury**. These funds will be used in future co-creative projects together. Since all collectors + purchasers gain access to *Homemade Universe*, 5% of this project’s proceeds are funnelling into a community that you are co-creator and co-owner of. \n\n## Form — The Official Music Video \n\nThe official music video for \"Form\" is [**now up for auction on Zora**](https://zora.co/chaim/3172), filmed + edited by myself while stuck in a quarantine hotel in Montreal in May 2020. 🥽\n\n*Form* is written by Jason Yik Nam Wu + myself, and produced by Rabitt.\n\nThe reserve bid is 0.5 ETH. You can [**bid here**](https://zora.co/chaim/3172). \n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3172)\n\n# THE COLLECTIBLES\n\nThere are 9 collectible NFTs — one for each song on the album. \n\n### **Tracks no. 1 thru 6 — *Form, Tear, Sand, Red Balloons, Crazy, Island***\n\nThe collectibles for the 6 finished songs can be [viewed and collected here](https://rarible.com/chaim). Each NFT is an edition of 5, priced at 0.1 ETH. \n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572882:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572863:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572834:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572824:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572812:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572803:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\nThe 3 unfinished songs each have their own mechanics in place to experiment with 3 different forms of collective creation…\n\n### **Track no. 7 — *Flavors*** + the *Flavors Feature Contest*\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/1012987)\n\n*Flavors* is written by Matt Parad + myself, and produced by Matt Parad. We started writing this song on my birthday. It was the first time Matt and I had ever worked together. \n\nThe song is nearly finished, but has an empty second verse that needs a feature. Hence, the ***Flavors Feature Contest***. Anyone who collects an NFT or purchases an album bundle copy receives one (1) entry into the contest. \n\nAfter your purchase and/or collection, you’ll receive a private download of the album. Included will be an mp3 of Flavors with an open second verse. You can use that file to start writing your verse. You will also gain access to the Homemade Universe discord server, where you will be able to submit your version of Flavors. Submissions will close on June 20 2021. \n\nA winner will then be chosen to be the official feature of Flavors. The final version of the song with your verse on it will then be released as a 1/1 Catalog NFT and, eventually, on the Textures OF A Long Forgotten Assumption album release on streaming platforms. \n\n**The winner will also receive this 1/1 collectible NFT of Flavors, as well as 10% of the master’s future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties etc).**\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:1012987:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\n### **Track no. 8 — *Paint*** + the *Silent Auction*\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/1012935)\n\nThe song *Paint* is still in a very early demo stage. In fact, I don’t yet have a chorus for it. I wrote the beginnings of this song with Danny Majic, and have always loved the first verse and pre-chorus. But there is still a ways to go on this song, and I am looking for 1 partner to join along for the ride. \n\nThis partner will be the ***creative director*** for the song *Paint* — and this role can look many different ways. Perhaps you’re a musician and can help with the songwriting or production of the song, perhaps you’re visual artists and can help on the visual side. Perhaps you don’t consider yourself an artist whatsoever, but can help on the outreach and marketing side. Perhaps you just want to get a closer look into the makings of a song, and just want to take pictures of the process on your disposable camera. Whatever it may be! This creative director position is yours to fill however you choose, should you win it of course. \n\nNow, how do you win it?\n\nThe *Paint* collectible is a 1/1 NFT on Rarible, and is up for **Silent Auction**. \n\nYes, that’s correct. Silent Auction. \n\nTo win this auction, you must email me your bid. \n\nThat’s correct. Email me your bid at paintauctionbid@gmail.com. \n\nYour bid can be in ETH, it can be in USD, it can be in CAD, or DOGE or WRITE or any other currency on the planet. It can also be a non-currency bid! It can be a barter of some kind — maybe a good or maybe a service. Anything! Get creative! \n\nThis is for the role of creative director on the song. So show me your creativity. And show me how much you want it. :)\n\nOnce the first bid is in, a 24-hour countdown will commence. I will announce updates on the Silent Auction in real-time on [twitter](https://twitter.com/matthewchaim). \n\n**The winner will be the official creative director for *Paint*, win this 1/1 collectible NFT, and receive 10% of the master’s future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties etc).**\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:1012935:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\n### **Track no. 9 — *Untitled*** + the *Untitled Creative Director DAO*\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430/572927)\n\nGrab your [entry NFT into the *Untitled Creative Director DAO* here](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details).\n\n1 creative director is great. But what about 100? \n\nYes, that’s correct. 100 creative directors. \n\nThat is what I am in search of for this last song on the album, which does not yet even have a name. As you can see, we have our work cut out for ourselves. \n\nIn fact, I’m not even sure which demo on mine should be the 9th and final song on the project. There are a few options that I really love, but I need your help to decide on which one to pursue. That is where we will start our collective decision making. Here’s how it works:\n\nThe Untitled collectible is a **100 edition** NFT on [Rarible](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details), with each edition priced at **0.03 ETH**.
