I started using their internal APIs and, from there, worked my way to more decentralized sources. Here’s how I did it (and how you can too).\n\n## The Actual Write Race\n\nThe idea for [The Actual Write Race](https://write-race.m1guelpf.me) was to build a list of all existing Mirror publications, and rank them based on the number of articles they had written (simulating Mirror’s $WRITE race) to add a fun touch.\n\nTo get the list of publications, we can query the Mirror GraphQL API (live at `https://mirror-api.com/graphql`) with the following query:\n\n```graphql\nquery FetchPublications {\n    publications {\n        ensLabel\n        displayName\n\tavatarURL\n\tcontributor {\n\t    displayName\n\t    avatarURL\n\t    address\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `publications` query will give us most of the data we need, and if I were to build a simple listing I could have stopped here, but I also need the number of entries to rank them. Ideally, I should just be able to fetch the `entries` key on the above query, but due to how Mirror has structured their API, the entries are set to `null` when querying the publication list. Instead, we can use a second query to fetch the entries for each publication and check the length of those.\n\n```graphql\nquery PublicationEntries($ensLabel: String!) {\n    publication(ensLabel: $ensLabel) {\n        ensLabel\n        entries {\n            digest\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt’s not the best system, and it has a blatant N+1 issue, but it’s the best I could get for this project, and the data is only fetched once a day, so it didn’t end up being an issue. If you want to learn more about this project, [the source is available on GitHub](https://github.com/m1guelpf/write-race).\n\n## Mirror Client\n\nThe Mirror interface is beautiful, and I wanted to take a chance at recreating it with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), so I decided to build a custom Mirror client with [Next.js](https://nextjs.com). The hard part of this project turned out to be retrieving Mirror entries in a decentralized way (querying the blockweave instead of Mirror’s API).\n\nTo start, we need to know the wallet address of the publication owner. Since Mirror subdomains are ENS names, we can do this by resolving `{publication}.mirror.xyz` with any ENS resolver. With this information, we can query the blockweave (which conveniently offers a GraphQL API hosted at `https://arweave.net/graphql`) by retrieving transactions created by Mirror and signed by that wallet address:\n\n```graphql\nquery FetchTransactions($address: String!) {\n    transactions(first: 100, tags: [{ name: \"App-Name\", values: [\"MirrorXYZ\"] }, { name: \"Contributor\", values: [$address] }]) {\n        edges {\n            node {\n                id\n                tags {\n                    name\n                    value\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSince Mirror supports editing entries by pushing additional transactions, we need to check the `Original-Content-Digest` tag to make sure we only take the latest edition of each entry into account. We’ll use that original digest as the slug for the post (emulating Mirror) and the node ID to fetch the entry from the blockweave using the Arweave NPM library.\n\n```js\nconst getPaths = async () => {\n    const {\n        data: {\n            transactions: { edges },\n        },\n    } = await queryGraphQL()\n\n    edges.map(({ node }) => {\n        const tags = Object.fromEntries(node.tags.map(tag => [tag.name, tag.value]))\n\t\t\n        return { slug: tags['Original-Content-Digest'], path: node.id }\n    }).filter(entry => entry.slug && entry.slug !== '').reduce((acc, current) => {\n        const x = acc.find(entry => entry.slug === current.slug)\n\t\t\n        if (!x) return acc.concat([current])\n        else return acc\n    }, [])\n}\n\nconst getEntries = async () => {\n    const paths = await getPaths()\n\t\t\n    return Promise.all(\n        paths.map(async entry => JSON.parse(\n            await arweave.transactions.getData(entry.path, { decode: true, string: true }), entry.slug)\n        )\n    )\n}\n```\n\nThis will get you an array of entries following [this format](https://fr7z6iuftumjyixkaozevog2og5weiop5xzjl7jxp4jq2jegwz2q.arweave.net/LH-fIoWdGJwi6gOySrjacbtiIc_t8pX9N38TDSSGtnU), you can then just parse the markdown bodies and render your entries.\n\nThen, to fetch the contents of a single entry, you can query by the original content digest (which we’re using as a slug).\n\n```graphql\nquery FetchTransaction($digest: String!) {\n    transactions(tags: { name: \"Original-Content-Digest\", values: [$digest] }) {\n        edges {\n            node {\n                id\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nKeep in mind in this example we’re not verifying the signature of any of these entries, so anyone could add new entries with a random string as the signature. Ideally, you’d use a library like `eth-sig-util` to make sure all entries are authentic.\n\nIf you’re curious about the source of my Mirror client, it’s [available on GitHub](https://github.com/m1guelpf/mirror-next). You can also see it live [at m1guelpf.blog](https://m1guelpf.blog).\n\n## Extending Mirror\n\nWith these two data sources (Mirror’s GraphQL API & the blockweave), you can build anything on top of Mirror. Here are a few ideas:\n\n- RSS feeds for Mirror blogs (my Mirror client [already includes an RSS feed](https://m1guelpf.blog/feed.xml), you’d just need to make it work with any other publication\n- A substack-like app that watches for new entries on a specific publication (or maybe all of them?) and emails subscribers the content.\n- A interface allowing people who don’t yet have a Mirror publication to publish their articles on Arweave using the same format Mirror uses.\n\nMake sure to send me any cool apps you build with Mirror!

Let’s call it *Analytic Youtube*. My absolute favorite is the 2017 durational work (lol) “*Saying Logan Paul 100,000 Times*” in which he says Logan Paul 100,000 times over 17 hours.\n\n[Saying Logan Paul 100,000 Times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FX6rml2Yjs)\n\nYoutube is a platform driven aggressively by metrics. Big numbers. No surprise this performed well. Today the work has 16,492,195 views. Hear me out; this shit is profound[^3]. He takes the aggregate behavior of 100,000 Youtubers and performs it in one go. Call it “*The User is Present*” or whatever.\n\n---\n\nWe live in an increasingly parametric world. One easily consumed and shaped by models. It’s funny to think about how these TikTokers are normalizing “parametric design” in a sense.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eb1cff37-e33b-4165-8f3d-3ea99a090ba9.jpeg?height=667&width=1000)\n\nFor instance, within architecture, a site condition is established and permutations in form are generated. The design processes becomes curatorial. Many practices today are centered around these principles of parametricism in response to advances in fabrication; the tools and materials at hand.\n\nWe can say this is nothing new or novel. It’s just more evenly distributed now. In other words, fuck your process, I’m just making TikToks.\n\n---\n\nIn the near future I expect to see way more ML video processing beyond face filters. The emergent behavior of TikTokers feels like a warm up for this super automated future. A convergence between inevitable functionality and what creators are making today.\n\n[Style GAN test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCBTZh41Ris)\n\nSnap has shipped filters which map your face on to animations that make you dance… this is *not* what I’m trying to point out here. It has more to do w/ creative process and how the platforms shape the work created and shared within them.\n\nI wonder how much of *Parametric TikTok*’s novelty is thanks to interpretation. If we had trained a model on Little Durag’s dance and curated the best 10 out of 100,000 permutations would it hit the same? Even assuming they were indistinguishable from the originals?\n\nBy the time it’s possible I assume the novelty will have worn off. Similar to how anyone who has grown up with the artificiality of facetune can see right through it. I am curious to see the unexpected ways these future applications of ML on platforms will continue to shape what users create and share.\n\n---\n\nThis entry was written in 2020, at the start of the pandemic, and reposted here for archival purposes.

Let’s call it *Analytic Youtube*. My absolute favorite is the 2017 durational work (lol) “*Saying Logan Paul 100,000 Times*” in which he says Logan Paul 100,000 times over 17 hours.\n\n[Saying Logan Paul 100,000 Times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FX6rml2Yjs)\n\nYoutube is a platform driven aggressively by metrics. Big numbers. No surprise this performed well. Today the work has 16,492,195 views. Hear me out; this shit is profound[^3]. He takes the aggregate behavior of 100,000 Youtubers and performs it in one go. Call it “*The User is Present*” or whatever.\n\n---\n\nWe live in an increasingly parametric world. One easily consumed and shaped by models. It’s funny to think about how these TikTokers are normalizing “parametric design” in a sense.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eb1cff37-e33b-4165-8f3d-3ea99a090ba9.jpeg?height=667&width=1000)\n\nFor instance, within architecture, a site condition is established and permutations in form are generated. The design processes becomes curatorial. Many practices today are centered around these principles of parametricism in response to advances in fabrication; the tools and materials at hand.\n\nWe can say this is nothing new or novel. It’s just more evenly distributed now. In other words, fuck your process, I’m just making TikToks.\n\n---\n\nIn the near future I expect to see way more ML video processing beyond face filters. The emergent behavior of TikTokers feels like a warm up for this super automated future. A convergence between inevitable functionality and what creators are making today.\n\n[Style GAN test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCBTZh41Ris)\n\nSnap has shipped filters which map your face on to animations that make you dance… this is *not* what I’m trying to point out here. It has more to do w/ creative process and how the platforms shape the work created and shared within them.\n\nI wonder how much of *Parametric TikTok*’s novelty is thanks to interpretation. If we had trained a model on Little Durag’s dance and curated the best 10 out of 100,000 permutations would it hit the same? Even assuming they were indistinguishable from the originals?\n\nBy the time it’s possible I assume the novelty will have worn off. Similar to how anyone who has grown up with the artificiality of facetune can see right through it. I am curious to see the unexpected ways these future applications of ML on platforms will continue to shape what users create and share.\n\n---\n\nThis entry was written in 2020, at the start of the pandemic, and reposted here for archival purposes. Anyway, I’m not here to make a point. Just meandering after going down a TikTok hole ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nAnd don’t get me started on *Pandemic Parametric TikTok*.\n\n[^1]: There are plenty of other instances, including [imjoeyreed](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJPcxUQb/). Durag stands out for how the comments are literally weighted.\n[^2]: Yea I’m gonna play this card. I was waaaaay ahead of the curve on Metro Station. I was friends w/ someone who was the sister of one of the two guys. A demo of Shake It was her song on Myspace. I remember when they signed to Columbia.

Three years later, we've hit many of the milestones. Below is an update to the original version that includes some recent advancements.*\n\nReputation, on the Internet, has been warped. We’ve built an information system that rewards recency and relevancy mechanics, with an aim more towards discoverability than integrity. It has become a competition to generate results for result’s sake. We’ve strayed away from the efforts that make something truly reputable and instead over-indexed on the end result, generalizing how we value information on the web today. It doesn’t matter what you put into it as long as what comes out matches the criteria for success. And that’s wrong.\n\nThere’s a very simple reason for this behavior: we don’t know what the systems to derive reputation look like on a global scale. It’s not quantifiable, and at a baseline isn’t a definition that is mutually agreed upon by all. Filtering this much content on the web, even in groups powered by large computing systems, is too influenced by outside sociological and political pressures. This filtering pushes towards filter bubbles and separates in an effort to integrate. Not to mention, outside incentives are hindering our ability to deliver anything of absolute true value.\n\nTo create stronger reputation signals in this newest iteration of the web, we’re going to need to build off of the benefits of the previous versions of the web and leverage the coordination abilities that come from an uncensorable, highly available, and ubiquitous database. We need to align technology with the ethics and value we as a society hold dear. This, of course, leads us to a blockchain powered by an incentive system that rewards participation and holds accountability through immutability.\n\n*So let’s start from the beginning.*\n\n**Democratized**\n\nIn the first attempt to build out the web, we didn’t have a set way to determine and identify what was reputable or established. The web itself was in its infancy and wasn’t structured to maintain the responsibility it eventually held as becoming the technical system for society. What we found out very quickly was that this system enabled all humans to express themselves freely and openly in a way that not only made them unique, but made them connected to the rest of the world. The web became a society of information.\n\nDirectories were the first way to sort all of this information through some reasonably well-defined hierarchy. We started grouping websites together as “web rings” to trade traffic with one another; once you identified a good site, you could expect similar quality from the other participants within the ring. Search engines built giant computing engines in order to index all of the information, created the first filtering algorithms, and made it easy to actively find things we expressed intent on learning about based on how many times the content was referenced on other websites.\n\nParticipating in the first web was open and democratized, but there was some significant issues. Filtering all of that information in a way to help quality content surface to the top was extremely problematic. Search engine optimization (SEO) became a game that had extremely high rewards for those who could land themselves in the top results for high volume keywords. To become good at finding the results that mattered to you, you had to learn boolean algebra. Collecting and crawling all of the websites as the primary way to capture information can leave some content behind. If the author wasn’t well-versed at the black magic that is SEO, there’s a chance that their content might not be indexed correctly which could create an artificial censorship. Of course, some of the companies that built search engines aren’t even allowed to serve results in certain countries which has created a very real censorship issue. Searching is a very active process and doesn’t help us passively find content that might be relevant to our needs. Directories did a good job at categorizing content to ”surf through”, but that still took hours of work sometimes to find what you were looking for if you weren’t exactly sure on how to describe it.\n\n**Web 1.0** didn’t create a strong way to expose reputable content, but it completely democratized content creation, distribution, and monetization. For a first attempt, we made something that forever impacted how every human in the world receives information. The next leap was distribution.\n\n**Distributed**\n\n**Web 2.0** was all about your content living where the users were. We developed these new platforms with engagements such as likes, retweets, and upvotes as the next way to build reputation signals for content. Each action created a public signal that could be used to help personalize content that could now be delivered to users on the platforms passively because we knew what was popular within each other’s social groups without requiring intent to give meaningful results.\n\nPlatforms from Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter accelerated the standardization of making an Application Programing Interfaces (APIs) available which created a more distributed way to access content instead of relying on search and created massive ecosystems of developers expanding their reach. However, your content would no longer just live on your website or blog, but it now had to be modified to fit the platforms in which it was hosted on. As of July 2018, there are at least 20 social platforms with more than 200 million users. For someone tasked with delivering information, it was critical understand how information moved and how best to deliver it across technical borders. Each platform had a separate algorithm and list of “success” criteria, creating far more complexity than SEO.\n\nThe goal was to strike up relevant conversations and share interesting topics with each other, but instead we all became acutely aware of how our actions represented our reputation, honesty and accountability. Although we had more ways to access content than we ever had with completely centralized platforms, we concentrated effort towards a handful of platforms that had mastered distribution which [something] power again to a small handful of platforms. The products weren’t just the platforms anymore; the products had become the publishers and the source for reputation on the web. Naturally, most users started manipulating the algorithms to paint the picture they wanted seen, not what was really happening or was important. We started valuing our efforts by quantifying it in the likes, retweets and comments our content captured and again gaming the underlying systems that powered reputation.\n\nWeb 2.0 gave us a whole new lens to start looking at content through and our relationships between each other became an integral part of how we consumed information. No longer did we have to seek out information, but instead we created an issue where we had too much coming at us at all times. We trusted our friends, but not the sources our friends used, which created a significant difficulty in determining the reputation of content. Social signals didn’t tell the whole truth about the reputation of content, but did again provided a profound new way to connect all of the people on earth.\n\n**Decentralized**\n\nMisinformation is more present and accessible than ever, and “truth” and “trust” are no longer objective in the eyes of all consumers. This is where we need to play in what I call “the gray”. How can we build a system that is impartial, not necessarily pushing people towards a black or white but rather exposing information in the gray? To do that, we need a decentralized record of information and an incentive system to build towards a common goal for the network, by the network. The next wave of the web is truly about reputation, and not only what is recent and relevant.\n\nThe next web of reputation systems is starting to develop and all signs point to blockchain technologies being the foundation. We are now able to deliver information that’s easily curated but uncensorable. We’re working with data sets and information that is ubiquitous but not overwhelming. The bridge to this web is connecting content with accountability through immutability and reputation. This participation and ownership will push towards a new culture, and not succumb to the vanity that unearthed in the distribution phase. We’re making the web free again.\n\nTogether, we’re building the foundation for a verifiable web, a place where we can construct the next generation of technologies that highlight the value of the individual. This is what makes reputation in this era different; it’s about the individual, the efforts that go into a given action and integrating systems to measure that. It’s not about the platforms where information is distributed or the channels where it is found, it is about the individual sender and the value tied to their efforts.\n\nBecause of this, the next chapter of reputation will flip from “reputation of platform and publisher” to “reputation of individual.” The source of reputation is no longer with the platform where the creator resides but tethered to the creator itself. Consumers, observers and owners are becoming more creator specific; there is less trust in the platforms and distribution mechanisms and more on the messengers that deliver. Through decentralization, we’re able to build systems that enable these messengers to separate dependency from platforms for audience, revenue and growth. It opens a new economy where reputation is aligned directly with the creator.\n\nCurrently, there have been platforms that enable coordination and allocation of intrinsic or extrinsic “capital” to achieve shared goal. With blockchain-based networks, we want to incentivize participants towards some predictable outcome that is beneficial for every network participant. It’s not just about the group, but also about the network participant themself.\n\nWhat’s most exciting about this next era of permissionless innovation is that it’s not longer dependent on a central authority. It’s not dependent on host, network, publisher or platform. This era of reputation is not built and dictated by a set standard of link share clubs or opaque algorithms. It’s adjustable, adaptable, managed and maintained by your preferences. We no longer need to be strictly driven by how a single platform categorizes, aggregates, and rewards. We can rely on each other to index this information now in a way that benefits all of the participants.\n\nIt is important that we understand the values of this new era of permissionless systems as they pertain to the individual. The biggest value that this brings, and what separates it from prior mechanics in democratized and distributed systems is the opportunity of interoperability. This new era means that all the work someone puts within a single network can now be collected and used beyond that network. Interoperable reputation in the decentralized era is the freedom to leverage what you’ve built beyond restrictive borders. As an example, let’s look at the media landscape:\n\nIn media, the main driver for revenue is both subscriptions and advertising. These two means fund the growth of media on the web and are platform specific. That means, when someone subscribes or advertises to something, they do so on the platform rather than the individual. The platform holds the reputation, and the individual leverages the platform to build their own audience and value. An example is the writer relationship to the Washington Post, the photographer’s relationship to Getty Images or a musicians relationship to Spotify. There are many. These reputation based systems are prominent in democratized and distributed eras but begin to fail in the decentralized phase. This is a good thing. Here’s how it works:\n\nThe current: The value and ways of driving revenue for creators through advertising and subscriptions are currently platform specific, even though they are all driven by wanting to own a message directly. The reputation is tied to the platform as dictated by the democratized and distributed web. In this era of reputation (decentralized) this balance shifts.\n\nThe shift: The creator’s reputation is now the value. It's no longer about advertising or transacting with the NYT or Spotify or Getty directly. It’s about transacting with that creator wherever that creator is. This is doable now because reputation is aligned with the individual itself.\n\nThe result: a monolithic shift in the opportunity for creators and the restraints of the companies that are currently working as hard as possible to best represent them. It’s no longer a forfeiture of reputation to centralized systems, it’s taking ownership and allowance of your own value, your own reputation. In this case, the reputation is now on the individual, not the platform or the grantor; you, and your work are what is reputable and that carries throughout the entire web ecosystem, regardless of the platform it lives on.\n\nThis shift towards individuality as a driver of reputation in the decentralized era is exactly what will drive everyone towards a better web. Each stage has shown a both progress and digress in where we aim to go and how far we still have to go to get there. With this next step towards reputation, individuals are now empowered by the commitment to the openness of ecosystem and the network of builders, verifiers and maintainers of a healthy and newfound ecosystem. There will no doubt be short falls, but investing in building networks that account for interoperability, freedom and openness move us closer to a web where we can find better information, better knowledge and better trust. This is the future of a reputable web. The web of the individual.", "timestamp": 1617472185, "digest": "WaWofVz9ekmQ6UyOVgovQFtg1mRbnA1aYfaFy1oPcVs", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}

It’s good to lead a balanced life. Soon after the release of *Changes* an exchange played out over an afternoon on Twitter. An artist accused Bieber of directly lifting a hook from his record. It was beyond similar; it was identical. Listen to [Bieber’s track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf0B9v9lDYU&ab_channel=JustinBieber) and then [the original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtX4CmURvKE&ab_channel=AsherMonroe-Topic).

We should do better.\n\nSplice does a good job at discovery and distribution, but the flat rate subscription licensing deal leaves artists out of possible upside, like with Laxcity. When musicians list their samples (or ideas) as up for remix, you could imagine a *split* is created when dropping a Splice sample into a track. For Laxcity, who’s sample runs the full duration of the track and forms its foundation, the *split* could be generous.

They must be both understandable *and* lead to a deeper knowledge of what crypto unlocks.

Laxcity was excited for the attention, but is that only in absence of creative tools which include him in the flow of value *by default*? Bieber and his producers were being *uncreative* by using that sample. What if they had been using an *uncreative* interface in an *uncreative* ecosystem?\n\nIn the Twitter video response Laxcity says “Here it is, I wrote this MIDI.” This is beautiful phrasing. MIDI is a communication protocol for musical instruments introduced in 1981. *1981*. This may seem long ago, but relative the history of music, it barely registers as a blip. But for a new generation of producers, music and MIDI are one and the same. Protocols become the defaults, and the defaults become how we think.\n\nThere is so much work to do.\n\n---\n\nIf it were possible to assign a series of splits for this entry, it would look similar to this:\n\n- `10%` Kennith Goldsmith for being the source of *Uncreative Writing*.\n- `10%` The Mirror team for collaboratively generating many of the ideas around *splits*. This split would behave as though directed at a DAO.\n- `5%` Laxcity for providing an insight about remixes and sampling.\n- `2.5%` [Brainpickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/), as I stole and slightly modified a paragraph (or two) from them when searching Goldsmith.\n\n---\n\n## Notes and resources\n\n- ML training datasets.

It’s good to lead a balanced life. Soon after the release of *Changes* an exchange played out over an afternoon on Twitter. An artist accused Bieber of directly lifting a hook from his record.

{"id": "JSst369hS-ckql2BykRTg4UcVQXv9f2nePYR5kU3C38", "title": "Building apps with Mirror", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/60d940cf-0d56-42b7-a48e-b6dd302470ea.jpg)\n\nOver the past few weeks, I built a few apps that integrated with [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz), to try and understand how their protocol worked. I started using their internal APIs and, from there, worked my way to more decentralized sources. Here’s how I did it (and how you can too).\n\n## The Actual Write Race\n\nThe idea for [The Actual Write Race](https://write-race.m1guelpf.me) was to build a list of all existing Mirror publications, and rank them based on the number of articles they had written (simulating Mirror’s $WRITE race) to add a fun touch.\n\nTo get the list of publications, we can query the Mirror GraphQL API (live at `https://mirror-api.com/graphql`) with the following query:\n\n```graphql\nquery FetchPublications {\n\tpublications {\n\t\tensLabel\n\t\tdisplayName\n\t\tavatarURL\n\t\tcontributor {\n\t\t\tdisplayName\n\t\t\tavatarURL\n\t\t\taddress\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThe `publications` query will give us most of the data we need, and if I were to build a simple listing I could have stopped here, but I also need the number of entries to rank them. Ideally, I should just be able to fetch the `entries` key on the above query, but due to how Mirror has structured their API, the entries are set to `null` when querying the publication list. Instead, we can use a second query to fetch the entries for each publication and check the length of those.\n\n```graphql\nquery PublicationEntries($ensLabel: String!) {\n\tpublication(ensLabel: $ensLabel) {\n\t\tensLabel\n\t\tentries {\n\t\t\tdigest\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nIt’s not the best system, and it has a blatant N+1 issue, but it’s the best I could get for this project, and the data is only fetched once a day, so it didn’t end up being an issue. If you want to learn more about this project, [the source is available on GitHub](https://github.com/m1guelpf/write-race).\n\n## Mirror Client\n\nThe Mirror interface is beautiful, and I wanted to take a chance at recreating it with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), so I decided to build a custom Mirror client with [Next.js](https://nextjs.com). The hard part of this project turned out to be retrieving Mirror entries in a decentralized way (querying the blockweave instead of Mirror’s API).\n\nTo start, we need to know the wallet address of the publication owner. Since Mirror subdomains are ENS names, we can do this by resolving `{publication}.mirror.xyz` with any ENS resolver. With this information, we can query the blockweave (which conveniently offers a GraphQL API hosted at `https://arweave.net/graphql`) by retrieving transactions created by Mirror and signed by that wallet address:\n\n```graphql\nquery FetchTransactions($address: String!) {\n\ttransactions(first: 100, tags: [{ name: \"App-Name\", values: [\"MirrorXYZ\"] }, { name: \"Contributor\", values: [$address] }]) {\n\t\tedges {\n\t\t\tnode {\n\t\t\t\tid\n\t\t\t\ttags {\n\t\t\t\t\tname\n\t\t\t\t\tvalue\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nSince Mirror supports editing entries by pushing additional transactions, we need to check the `Original-Content-Digest` tag to make sure we only take the latest edition of each entry into account. We’ll use that original digest as the slug for the post (emulating Mirror) and the node ID to fetch the entry from the blockweave using the Arweave NPM library.\n\n```js\nconst getPaths = async () => {\n\tconst {\n\t\tdata: {\n\t\t\ttransactions: { edges },\n\t\t},\n\t} = await queryGraphQL()\n\n\tedges.map(({ node }) => {\n\t\tconst tags = Object.fromEntries(node.tags.map(tag => [tag.name, tag.value]))\n\t\t\n\t\treturn { slug: tags['Original-Content-Digest'], path: node.id }\n\t}).filter(entry => entry.slug && entry.slug !== '').reduce((acc, current) => {\n\t\tconst x = acc.find(entry => entry.slug === current.slug)\n\t\t\n\t\tif (!x) return acc.concat([current])\n\t\telse return acc\n\t}, [])\n}\n\nconst getEntries = async () => {\n\tconst paths = await getPaths()\n\t\t\n\treturn Promise.all(\n\t\tpaths.map(async entry => JSON.parse(\n\t\t\tawait arweave.transactions.getData(entry.path, { decode: true, string: true }), entry.slug)\n\t\t)\n\t)\n}\n```\n\nThis will get you an array of entries following [this format](https://fr7z6iuftumjyixkaozevog2og5weiop5xzjl7jxp4jq2jegwz2q.arweave.net/LH-fIoWdGJwi6gOySrjacbtiIc_t8pX9N38TDSSGtnU), you can then just parse the markdown bodies and render your entries.\n\nThen, to fetch the contents of a single entry, you can query by the original content digest (which we’re using as a slug).\n\n```graphql\nquery FetchTransaction($digest: String!) {\n\ttransactions(tags: { name: \"Original-Content-Digest\", values: [$digest] }) {\n\t\tedges {\n\t\t\tnode {\n\t\t\t\tid\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nKeep in mind in this example we’re not verifying the signature of any of these entries, so anyone could add new entries with a random string as the signature. Ideally, you’d use a library like `eth-sig-util` to make sure all entries are authentic.\n\nIf you’re curious about the source of my Mirror client, it’s [available on GitHub](https://github.com/m1guelpf/mirror-next). You can also see it live [at m1guelpf.blog](https://m1guelpf.blog).\n\n## Extending Mirror\n\nWith these two data sources (Mirror’s GraphQL API & the blockweave), you can build anything on top of Mirror. Here are a few ideas:\n\n- RSS feeds for Mirror blogs (my Mirror client [already includes an RSS feed](https://m1guelpf.blog/feed.xml), you’d just need to make it work with any other publication.\n- A list of all the available crowdfunds throughout Mirror publications, as well as some stats on finished ones.\n- A substack-like app that watches for new entries on a specific publication (or maybe all of them?) and emails subscribers the content.\n- A interface allowing people who don’t yet have a Mirror publication to publish their articles on Arweave using the same format Mirror uses.\n\nMake sure to send me any cool apps you build with Mirror!
