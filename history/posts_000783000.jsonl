The networks have conspired to dumb us down. But when you get a little older, you realize that’s not true. The networks are in business to give people exactly what they want. That’s a far more depressing thought. Conspiracy is optimistic! You can shoot the bastards! We can have a revolution! But the networks are really in business to give people what they want. It’s the truth.” - Steve Jobs\n\n> “We do these things “not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.” - John F. Kennedy\n\nLet’s begin with some facts. \n\n‘Centralization’ isn’t failing or fatally flawed. Centralized products and platforms are popular and successful. Centralization provides users with convenience, incredibly low prices, comprehensive directories and marketplaces, and just about everything else we associate with compelling innovations. Netflix, Spotify, Amazon, Apple, and Twitter are all examples of fantastically successful centralization that provides value every single day. \n\nBut centralization absolutely *does* limit the number of big ‘winners.’ The omnipresent power law skews value relentlessly to the top. We see this across top companies, investors, creators, influencers and beyond. The more centralized the platform or business, the more this tendency proves true. \n\nSo the real argument for crypto, and more broadly decentralization, is *not* that centralized systems are broken. Or that the current business models of the internet are not working. Because, in fact, they *are* for most consumers and many tens of thousands of creators. It’s that they are *so* functional that only a radical redistribution of control and ownership could wedge new opportunities to create more equity. It’s an attempt to counterbalance the massive ‘power law effects’ of these centralized systems.\n\nHere’s how it works, at least in theory: \n\n“Hey, Ms. or Mr. Developer or Creator or User, we are really worried about centralized systems. We’d like you to help us build alternatives. But we also know that you *not* using or working on those super-successful centralized things is a cost to you, and that developing these decentralized alternatives is going to be hard to pull off, so we’re going to make you an amazing once-in-a-lifetime offer. We will architect this whole new alternative system such that you will actually earn and/or buy inexpensive ‘shares’ and get a meaningful voice in what might just maybe be the next biggest thing. Maybe the biggest thing ever. And so, if and when all this does actually happen, you’ll be one of the big winners. We promise. And we don’t just *promise*. We’ll put it in a (smart) contract.”\n\nCrypto is a direct, maybe even desperate, financial and emotional appeal to shift your ass from passive consumption to active collaboration. \n\nNow, a gambit this great *only* makes sense if you believe in the massive self-perpetuating appeal of centralization. The competitive disadvantages of decentralization are so immense that it only works if the offered incentives (economic, cultural) outweigh those disadvantages. Which is why the incentives are a historically unprecedented amount of money and status. Think of it like the biggest XPRIZE in history, being offered to everyone on the planet.\n\nBut it should be noted, this incentive system *does* lead to a signaling problem. To keep people motivated to believe, work hard and spread these decentralized environments, it’s very helpful that the prices of the shares (ie., tokens, etc) and that triumphant vibe within the culture — all plausible evidence of the potential size of the prize and our progress towards it — continue to grow. And when we engineer the incentives correctly (tokenomics, ftw!), they do. The problem is that we have this natural mental association that assumes that when prices go up, when people get famous, and when huge sums of money are raised that means that the new thing is already working. \n\nBut in this case, that’s only partially true. It’s *true* that the incentive system is working, that people are flocking, that we’re getting artists and developers paid, that there’s a great feeling of community and commitment, and that there’s a growing awareness and interest from folks on the outside. But it’s not necessarily true that decentralized technology is working particularly well as a feasible replacement for those centralized competitors. At least not yet or any time soon. After all, as we know, the problem is incredibly hard. We wouldn’t be attacking centralization in this insane way if it wasn’t. \n\nAnd one of the specific consequences of the signaling problem is that it leads some people to underestimate the ability of the centralized systems to adjust. There's a natural assumption that successful systems get fat and lazy and that their processes become calcified and resistant to new information regarding threats. And after all, why would everything on the decentralized side be going up in value, if the competitor wasn't ripe for the killing? \n\nBut that assumption, that centralized systems don’t know what they’re doing, is delusional. These tech companies are fucking smart. They are led by nimble (and paranoid) leaders, with a ton of money and other treats to hand out, who have no problem understanding the importance of disrupting themselves (see Facebook). If their ‘number of winners’ problem gets too noticeable and acute, there’s a lot of tuning they can do, both symbolic and real, to adjust and make the situation look a lot better. And, here’s the kicker: it’s especially easy for them to co opt the user-friendliest features of decentralized culture to make themselves more popular. Not only that, but the incentive-seeking folks on the decentralized side will be overjoyed that they are being embraced by the big centralized companies (see Twitter verifying NFTs!). Because it increases the value of their ‘shares.’\n\nSo, given how daunting the challenge actually is, let’s ask ourselves again: Is centralization *really* as dangerous as those of us on the Web3 side believe? Does it lead inexorably to oligopoly, censorship, and the constraint of innovation? And if so, do those risks outweigh the difficulties and disadvantages posed by the blockchain gambit? On this, reasonable people can disagree. \n\nBut any reasonable person would also admit that the competent and popular centralization of our current moment puts massive, historic, practically God-like powers in the hands of a few dozen men (basically, all men) and a few thousand of their execs. That’s a few thousand ‘big winners’ among billions of people. They are for the most part not subject to boards or shareholders. While one or two may stumble, it's hardly far-fetched that the current pantheon will remain more or less unchanged for decades to come. Our devices will get cheaper, our networks more powerful, and our online experiences more engrossing. The number of lives influenced by this small group will continue to increase. So will the power and subtlety of their influence. \n\nAnd any reasonable person would again agree that it is not some panicky conjecture that these few leaders will acquiesce to, even collaborate with, authoritarian governments and anti-democratic movements when they think it unavoidable, when it protects or extends their corporate power. Despite how rich all these folks already are, this is happening today, as a matter of normal business. If the realistic prospect of a technology like the Metaverse, deployed in partnership with dictators and demagogues doesn’t qualify as a danger, then there’s probably not much that concerns you. \n\nWill the ‘Hail Mary’ of crypto, with all of its chaos and con jobs, do a better job with these threats? Come on. Nobody knows. As much as the wild incentive system doesn’t necessarily mean it will work, it’s equally wrong to say that it *can’t*. The underlying structure of the Internet is decentralized. Open Source projects are decentralized. They work. But they also imperfect, and have left massive openings for centralized systems to address their gaps and limitations.\n\nBased on everything we know, the most likely outcome is one of partial success. Some additional and important functions of the communications, media and financial system will be taken over by reasonably decentralized protocols and governance. This will be accompanied by the spread of platforms that enable groups of creators and inventors to fund their growth without as much dependency on the centralized networks. And this will lead some of the centralized systems to adopt and co-opt the features and culture of the blockchain which in turn creates new opportunities and openings. A different group of people, hopefully many more of them, hopefully not mostly men or Western, and with different (perhaps not objectively better but fresh) aspirations, ascend to the echelons of hyper-influence. In other words, a somewhat more dynamic and democratic system. \n\nWe think it’s worth trying.\n\n** \\n **", "timestamp": 1633346995, "digest": "wZNuGlgm-DTui3U4gM9T6jUWXQ2XX2bxMRABG5v0SPM", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}

I'll be using [Dune Analytics](https://dune.xyz/browse/dashboards) to run my queries, but there are many other tools you can use to query the chain such as [Big Query](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/ethereum-bigquery-public-dataset-smart-contract-analytics) and [Flipside Crypto](https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/).\n\n*If you're completely new to SQL and Ethereum I recommend starting with [my full beginners' overview](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-guide-to-basic-sql-while-learning-ethereum-at-the-same-time-9eac17a05929) first.*\n\n## Guide Overview\n\nWe're going to cover transactions in four layers:\n\n1. Transaction basics\n2. Function calls and state\n3. Internal Transactions (Traces)\n4. Logs (Events Emitted)\n\nAs the base for our transaction examples, we'll be using the [Mirror Crowdfund](https://etherscan.io/address/0x320d83769Eb64096Ea74B686Eb586E197997f930) contract. Put simply, this is a smart contract that allows you to get ERC20 (fungible) or ERC721 (NFTs) tokens in exchange for donating ETH to the contract. The creator of the contract can then withdraw those funds by closing the crowdfund. This is by no means a simple contract, but the point I want to make here is that you don't need to understand all the solidity code to start your analysis - you just need to know how to navigate the four layers above.\n\n**The three transactions we'll study are:**\n\n1. [Creation/deployment](https://www.notion.so/a80c56a2e510d95f41984e6b7af1b8db) of the crowdfund contract\n2. [Contributions of ETH](https://www.notion.so/51c8f3ef63ea0e4b65a1abfdbbb9d1ef) to the contract\n3. [Closing and withdrawing funds](https://www.notion.so/8e12aac74db238ebf11252740c3f65a8) from the contract\n\n*Side note, we also just opened up crowdfunds for anyone to use, so if you're curious or want to create a crowdfund head to [mirror.xyz/dashboard](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard) to get started. Hop into [our discord](https://discord.gg/xsxhV9rkWA) while you're at it!*\n\n## Creation/Deployment of the crowdfund contract\n\n**First Transaction:** [0x5e5ef5dd9d147028f9bc21127e3de774a80c56a2e510d95f41984e6b7af1b8db](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5e5ef5dd9d147028f9bc21127e3de774a80c56a2e510d95f41984e6b7af1b8db)\n\nLet's start with the transaction basics.\n\n1. Each transaction has a [unique keccak256](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/29936/what-happens-on-hash-collisions-for-e-g-transactions-blocks-and-contracts) `transaction hash` of a few different variables\n2. There's a `blocknumber` associated based on when the transaction was mined, typically a new block is created every 15 seconds.\n3. `From` is the one who signed the transaction, `To` is the contract address that was interacted with\n4. `Value` is the ETH value that was transferred *from the signer's wallet. Even if that value is 0 that doesn't mean that no ETH was transferred during the transaction.*\n5. Gas is a bit complicated (especially with EIP-1559), but just keep this formula in mind:\n\n   `Gas Price * Gas Used by Transaction = Transaction Fee`\n\nNow for the meat and bones, the `input data` of a transaction:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4oZ9oD4aHCFT9aYP6kPu9.png?height=163&width=1360)\n\nThis is just bytecode for any function call and the parameters passed in. The first 8 characters (4 bytes) are the function signature `0x849a3aa3`, essentially [a hash of the function name and parameter types](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/utils/abi/interface/#Interface--selectors). And no, these are [not always unique which can lead to hacks/security issues](https://rattibha.com/thread/1425217046636371969?lang=en).  In this case, this function calls the factory contract to create the crowdfund contract (it's a proxy, but we won't get into that).\n\n```jsx\ncreateCrowdfund((uint256,uint256,bytes32)[], (address,uint256), string, string, address, address, uint256, uint256, uint256)\n```\n\nThis shows up if you click \"decode input data\", and you can see the various variables values set as well. Every subsequent 64 characters (32 bytes) is a different input variable. The crowdfund comes with three tiers of editions. In this crowdfund for [BLVKHVND](https://blvkhvnd.mirror.xyz/) they used quantities of 1000, 250, and 50 with prices of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 ETH respectively.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ryWaJsBxoa7CrbhFZYPgL.png?height=138&width=1019)\n\nNotice that the price actually shows up as `100000000000000000` , which is because the first 18 zeroes represent decimals. We'll have to do the conversions by dividing by `10^18` in our data.\n\n**That was a lot, let's get to querying**. Dune has a table called `ethereum.transactions` which has all the variables we've talked about above for every transaction since the first block. We can query this table for the appearance of `0x849a3aa3` in the last few months:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM ethereum.transactions \nWHERE \"block_time\" > now() - interval '3 months'\nAND \"data\" is not null\nAND SUBSTRING ( encode(\"data\", 'hex'), 1, 8 ) = '849a3aa3'\n```\n\n`ethereum.transactions` is a very large table, so if you query without filters the query is going to timeout (taking more than 30 minutes). Filtering by `block_time` is usually most useful, and in this case we're taking all the rows that have occurred within 3 months. Also, many transactions are just ETH transfers without any `data` attached so we'll filter that out by only keeping `data is not null`. Now for checking for the function signature, we need to `encode` the data into a string from hexadecimal, then take only the characters from position 1 to position 8 using `SUBSTRING`.\n\n![https://dune.xyz/queries/192453 ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aVQdggGtELAKU3YCHCVxn.png?height=168&width=1450)\n\n**Now the complicated parts,** internal transactions and events emitted. For this, it'll be easier to look at the code. If you go to the `contract` tab on etherscan and do a ctrl+f on file 1 of 10 you'll find the following code (I've edited out some bits to make this more readable).\n\n```sql\nfunction createCrowdfund(\n        ...variables...\n    ) external returns (address crowdfundProxy) {\n        ...some variable prep code...\n\n        crowdfundProxy = address(\n            new CrowdfundWithPodiumEditionsProxy{\n                salt: keccak256(abi.encode(symbol_, operator_))\n            }(treasuryConfig, operator_)\n        );\n\n        emit CrowdfundDeployed(crowdfundProxy, name_, symbol_, operator_);\n\n        ...register to treasury code...\n    }\n```\n\n**The first key line here is** `crowdfundProxy = address(contract_to_be_created)`, which is what deploys the new contract and creates an internal transaction of type `CREATE 0`. Transferring ETH also creates an internal transaction of type `CALL` , which we'll see in the next transaction we study.\n\nWe can query for all the crowdfund contracts created with:\n\n```sql\nSELECT tx.\"block_time\", tx.\"from\", tr.\"type\", tr.\"code\"\nFROM ethereum.transactions tx \nLEFT JOIN ethereum.traces tr ON tx.\"hash\"=tr.\"tx_hash\" --tracks internal transactions\nWHERE tx.\"to\" = '\\x15312b97389a1dc3bcaba7ae58ebbd552e606ed2' -- crowdfund podiums edition\nAND tr.\"type\" = 'create' \n```\n\n![https://dune.xyz/queries/192466](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0LfwlNIrVZcQWkakKEh02.png?height=211&width=1453)\n\nWe need `ethereum.transactions` because we want to filter for traces (internal transactions) only related to transactions on the factory contract. We need this since an internal transaction will not always have the same `to` as that of the overall transaction. We can JOIN the tables on the transaction hash, and then filter for only internal transactions of the `create` type.\n\n**The second key line here is** `emit CrowdfundDeployed`, which creates a log that is [stored in the node but not in the block](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/1302/where-do-contract-event-logs-get-stored-in-the-ethereum-architecture). If you look at the logs, you'll notice that `EditionCreated` events are also emitted, but this is [from another contract that](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc4e0f3ec24972c75df7c716922096f4270b7bb4e) actually creates the ERC721 tokens (hence a different address).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PusoPAqPlUsyj5BEHpXHL.png?height=669&width=1265)\n\nSimilar to a function signature, events have a unique hash as well that sits in `Topic 0`. So in the events above, `0x5133bb164b64ffa4461bc0c782a5c0e71cdc9d6c6ef5aa9af84f7fd2cd966d8e` is the hash for `CrowdfundDeployed` and `0xbaf1f6ab5aa5406df2735e70c52585e630f9744f4ecdedd8b619e983e927f0b6` is the hash for `EditionCreated`.\n\nWe can query the `ethereum.logs` table in dune to see all crowdfunds created as well:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM ethereum.logs\nWHERE \"topic1\"='\\x5133bb164b64ffa4461bc0c782a5c0e71cdc9d6c6ef5aa9af84f7fd2cd966d8e'::bytea\n```\n\n![https://dune.xyz/queries/192553](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Wxhs88WFbxJdZ5lEv9yJS.png?height=101&width=1444)\n\n`topic2` and `topic3` typically hold the data for ETH transfers, otherwise, event data will show up in the `data` column. We'll get more into how to work with this later.\n\nLogs are very helpful, as they can be used to emit state variables instead of just the function call values (TheGraph [uses logs to model subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/docs/developer/create-subgraph-hosted) for GraphQL queries). Next, we'll utilize everything we've covered to study the contributions of ETH to our newly created crowdfund contract (sitting at the address `0x320d83769eb64096ea74b686eb586e197997f930` ).\n\n*If you've made it this far, then you're already through all the tough concepts. Give yourself a pat on the back! We'll really be getting into the details in the next two sections, so take a breather if you need to.*\n\n### Contributions of ETH to the contract\n\n**Second Transaction:** [0xd4ce80a5ee62190c5f5d5a5a7e95ba7751c8f3ef63ea0e4b65a1abfdbbb9d1ef](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd4ce80a5ee62190c5f5d5a5a7e95ba7751c8f3ef63ea0e4b65a1abfdbbb9d1ef)\n\nThis one is fairly simple to read. Jesse paid 1 ETH to mint an edition of tokenId 167 from the BLVKHVND crowdfund. He also got 1000 HVND, the ERC20 token the crowdfund gives out based on the size of the donation.\n\nBut what if we wanted to see how much ETH has been contributed over time, or how many editions have been sold? Sometimes contracts will have a view function in `Read Contract` on etherscan where you can get total balances. But in this case, the contract doesn't have that.\n\nRemember that function calls change the state data, which we'll need to piece together the overall state data by aggregating over transaction history. Sometimes the overall state of a contract can be emitted in events, such as with Compound V2's `AccrueInterest` event.\n\nIn our case, we'll need to do two things in one query to get to total ETH contributed:\n\n1. get the transactions that have the \"contribute\" method called\n2. sum the total ETH transferred by filtering for internal transactions which have the type `CALL`\n\n*Remember, I can get the method function signature by decoding the* `input data` on etherscan.\n\n```\nSELECT SUM(tr.\"value\"/1e18) as contribution FROM ethereum.transactions tx \nLEFT JOIN ethereum.traces tr ON tx.\"hash\" = tr.\"tx_hash\"\n--transactions filtering \nWHERE tx.\"to\" = '\\x320d83769eb64096ea74b686eb586e197997f930'::bytea\nAND tx.\"data\" is not null\nAND SUBSTRING ( encode(tx.\"data\", 'hex'), 1, 8 ) IN ('a08f793c', 'ce4661bb')\n--traces filtering \nAND tr.\"success\"\nAND tr.\"value\" > 0\nAND tr.\"call_type\" = 'call'\n```\n\nThere was technically another method called `contributeForPodium`, which is why we check for two function signatures above. The `CALL` type actually has subtypes as well at the opcode level, so we need the specific base `call_type` of `call` (if you're familiar with a delegatecall, then you'll know that would give us a double count). We joined on transaction hash, and then divided by 10^18 to get the right decimals of ETH value.\n\n![https://dune.xyz/queries/192577](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MD3p_DzK6lpdaK_2a2uGT.png?height=117&width=448)\n\nLet's move on to the last transaction, where the data starts to get really tricky on us.\n\n### Closing and withdrawing funds from the contract\n\n**Third Transaction:** [0xe9d5fefde77d4086d0f64dd1403f9b6e8e12aac74db238ebf11252740c3f65a8](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe9d5fefde77d4086d0f64dd1403f9b6e8e12aac74db238ebf11252740c3f65a8)\n\nHere, we can see that 337 ETH was transferred and 1,012,965 HVND tokens (the latter of which was decided by `operatorPercent_` in the first transaction). After this function is called, the contract just operates the way any normal ERC20 would.\n\nIn the case that a crowdfund was already closed, we could have gotten the total raised from the data in this transaction - such as value transferred in an internal transaction of `CALL` type. It's better to tie this to an event though, in case there are some transfer behaviors that we don't know about. *But wait, why are the logs not readable?*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZjTwXU_pkZ_gM3Pjd8blM.png?height=737&width=814)\n\nWell, this is where we start to get into some pretty confusing patterns. Earlier I mentioned that this crowdfund is deployed as a proxy - that means it’s just like an empty USB that plugs into a computer that actually holds the logic. It's much cheaper to create USBs than computers - and that logic holds for on-chain too (except the cost is in gas). If you want to read about proxy patterns, I'd check out [this great article by the OpenZeppelin team](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-state-of-smart-contract-upgrades/).\n\nThe computer in this case is known as the *logic* and is only deployed once. The proxy is deployed many times, and it doesn't have the logic functions or events in the contract code. Therefore,  etherscan isn't equipped to show the decoded data in logs. So then how do we piece this together? We could take the [keccak256 hash of the event](https://codeburst.io/deep-dive-into-ethereum-logs-a8d2047c7371), just like we did for function signatures. But here's where reading the code will help save you some time. If you go to `Read Contract` [on the factory contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x15312b97389a1dc3bcaba7ae58ebbd552e606ed2), you'll see the address of the logic contract:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VMw1PCwPe3F3WEw_QMY5-.png?height=109&width=430)\n\nFrom there, we can look for the `closeFunding()` function in the code:\n\n```sql\nfunction closeFunding() external onlyOperator nonReentrant {\n        ...code...\n\n        _mint(operator, operatorTokens);\n        // Announce that funding has been closed.\n        emit FundingClosed(address(this).balance, operatorTokens);\n\n        ...ETH value transfers...\n    }\n```\n\nETH value transfers don't emit events since they are just internal transactions. And if you are familiar with how the ERC20 standard works, you'll know that `_mint` actually creates a `Transfer` event (meaning that covers our first event). That means that `FundingClosed` must be the second log, with the topic of `0x352ce94da8e3109dc06c05ed84e8a0aaf9ce2c4329dfd10ad1190cf620048972`. Can you figure out why else it couldn't be the third log (**hint:** what's a key difference between the first two logs and the third log)?\n\nWith that knowledge, we can query this just like any other event, with some fancy data decoding (remember parameters are every 64 characters (32 bytes). We have to turn it into a string to slice it, and then we change it into a number and divide by 10^18 to get rid of decimals.\n\n```sql\nSELECT \"contract_address\", \n        bytea2numeric( decode ( SUBSTRING ( encode(\"data\", 'hex') , 1, 64 ), 'hex'))/1e18 as eth_raised, \n        bytea2numeric ( decode ( SUBSTRING ( encode(\"data\", 'hex') , 65 , 64 ), 'hex'))/1e18 as tokens_allocated_owned\nFROM ethereum.logs\nWHERE \"topic1\"='\\x352ce94da8e3109dc06c05ed84e8a0aaf9ce2c4329dfd10ad1190cf620048972'::bytea\nAND \"contract_address\"='\\x320d83769eb64096ea74b686eb586e197997f930'::bytea\n```\n\n![https://dune.xyz/queries/192560 ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zexwCRLDxYZpdCd17sUwz.png?height=120&width=1446)\n\nCongrats, you now know your way around `ethereum.transactions`, `ethereum.traces`, and `ethereum.logs`. They can always be joined by transaction hash, and then the rest is just knowing how to manipulate the data with `encode/decode`, `substring`, and some `bytea` operators. Woohoo!\n\n*We could have done this exercise for the* `contribute` method in the last transaction too. Since this is all happening on the proxy contract.\n\n### Putting it all together\n\nNow, if we had to go and keep track of function signatures and event topics - as well as decoding all the variables in each query - I think we would have all quit data analysis by now. Luckily, most data services have some variation of **[contract decoding](https://duneanalytics.com/decode),** meaning I can give a contract address and [the ABI](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/abi-spec.html#:\\~:text=The%20Contract%20Application%20Binary%20Interface,contract%2Dto%2Dcontract%20interaction.&text=This%20specification%20does%20not%20address,known%20only%20at%20run%2Dtime.) and Dune will take care of the decoding for me. That way, events/functions become their own tables and I can easily make the same \"total contributions\" query from earlier with this:\n\n```sql\nWITH \n    union_sum as (\n        SELECT SUM(\"amount\")/1e18 as raised FROM mirror.\"CrowdfundWithPodiumEditionsLogic_evt_Contribution\"\n        WHERE \"contract_address\"='\\x320d83769eb64096ea74b686eb586e197997f930'\n        \n        UNION ALL \n        \n        SELECT SUM(\"amount\")/1e18 as raised FROM mirror.\"CrowdfundWithPodiumEditionsLogic_evt_ContributionForEdition\"\n        WHERE \"contract_address\"='\\x320d83769eb64096ea74b686eb586e197997f930'\n    )\n    \nSELECT SUM(\"raised\") FROM union_sum\n```\n\n[https://dune.xyz/queries/192571](https://dune.xyz/queries/192571)\n\nThankfully this query is much more readable and easier to write. They even take care of proxy/factory logic patterns - thanks team! Without this abstraction, I guarantee that data analysis would be ten times messier to write and one hundred times worse to debug. Dune has plenty of other useful tables as well, such as `prices.usd` for daily token prices and `dex.trades` for all token trades across all main exchanges (and event `nft.trades` for OpenSea NFT actions).\n\nWhile most of the time you'll be playing with decoded data, knowing what really sits underneath it all will help you level up a lot faster in Web3! Plus, you're now etherscan fluent - which I promise will be a part of every crypto job description in the future. I hope you found this helpful, and as always feel free to reach out if you need some help getting started.", "timestamp": 1633354809, "digest": "mbR1n_CvflL1KIKCTG42bnM4HpfGBqDPNndH8mu2eJw", "contributor": "0x2Ae8c972fB2E6c00ddED8986E2dc672ED190DA06"}

Dirt is unique in that it funds its authors via NFTs of editions. It was natural to me to think of my Sims builds and their stories as art in the NFT space because of their innately liminal ontology. They are real architectural spaces and real worlds to the viewer—but they aren’t physically instantiated in our own world, so the non-fungible nature of the token lends itself to the medium’s ontological status.\n\n### TOOLS\n\nThe Sims 4, in which I build the structures and worlds central to my work, in many ways embodies the peak pre-\"late capitalist\" suburban aesthetic of the early 2000s, before the financial crash. The game is structured to facilitate building largely residential, private family homes, and to incentivize filling them with in-game possessions that increase in price and desirability as a Sim makes more income through fame or salary.\n\n![A typical Sims 3 interior included in MoMa's Applied Design exhibition in 2013. Attributed to original game designer Will Wright.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/91v1ZcaWOEN7BfYDsFgsx.jpg?height=598&width=800)\n\nWhat I enjoy most about the Sims 4 is using it explicitly contrary to this purpose. I design against the grain of the game’s built-in assumptions about what architecture should be. While much digital work in socially mediated gamespaces (including my own) is indebted both to the exhibition practices and media theory writing of Hito Steyerl, my work is in some ways best compared to the *[Drawing Restraint](https://www.frieze.com/article/matthew-barney-1)* series of performances by Matthew Barney. In this series, Barney, who began his practice while also a student-athlete at Yale, creates various physical obstacles that hold his body back from mark-making, including literal restraints, obstacle courses, and difficult substances. What I enjoy about the Sims 4 as a medium is precisely this sense of constraint.\n\nAs an artist, to come to the Sims gamespace as a medium initially surprised me. My background is in art history, in which I have a doctorate, and I often write literary-critical essays about architecture in particular, so my interest in buildings and their textual frames was long-established.\n\n### DESIGN PRINCIPLES\n\nThe classic reference one typically uses for the Sims—which was included in a MoMA retrospective on Applied Design as a whole game in 2013—is Baudrillard on simulacra and simulation. But my perspective on the Sims is not particularly rooted in Baudrillard, but rather in Walter Benjamin’s Arcades project and in Bourdieu’s work on ‘conspicuous consumption’ and the work buying and displaying objects does in defining the self under capitalism.\n\n![A rendered image from the Vestibule (Room 001) of my Pumpkin Spice Launch Arcology](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Bt5FHcszlRoTTCc_28b4U.png?height=1186&width=1812)\n\nI originally used the Sims 4 to think through theoretical issues in my academic writing about English Baroque and Japanese Metabolist architecture. During the pandemic, I became serious about building in the game as craft, and started to create increasingly complex  that became immersive world experiences without ever playing the game in ‘Live’ mode.\n\nThe game is very limited as a design tool compared to typical purpose-built professional software like AutoCAD or Revit—it doesn’t even allow for curved walls. It has a strictly fixed number of in-game assets that can be placed in a build, and hacking and reconfiguring these assets to make “new” objects that don’t already exist in-game is an essential part of my process. So too is using the game’s footprint restrictions on how Sims can use and interact with objects. My rules, or restraints, for myself, include that the build must be technically playable in the games ‘Live’ life simulation mode, that I do not use mods or import custom content to increase the number of build assets, and that I build any given story-world/structure within the bounds of a single in-game lot, which are limited to four floors in height. I tie my hands to make more interesting fictive worlds\n\n![An overview of the second floor of the Pumpkin Spice Launch Arcology](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xcVK-tz98OhU2Rkya59bI.png?height=716&width=710)\n\nFUNDING AND FUTURE WORK\n\nThe PSL Arcology is designed to be an early work that starts to test the limits of using the Sims as a medium for architecture as storytelling. It inspired its own story text as I built it, with the in-game constraints shaping what was possible to narrate and describe.\n\nIn the Pumpkin Spice Launch Arcology Build in particular, there are no exteriors and no windows—a structure of this scale simply renders horribly in the game’s exterior view—so stacking display objects to convey stories and experiences in a glance, like the flâneur passing the arcade in Benjamin’s 19th Century Paris, became increasingly important to me. I hope to build more structures in the  future that exploit the game’s exteriors and landscaping tools, as well as intimate single rooms and tiny houses, to which I can add even more granular detail, and in turn, frame texts that reflect my ongoing literary interests in speculative world-building and formal experimentation, from Borges and Calvino to Le Guin and Delany. Eventually, I would also like to explore other restricted in-game building modes to combine with text frames, including historic legacy software for design and urban planning from the 90’s.\n\n![Future build in progress: a modern lighthouse/cottage for immortals](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iIOTOEDTwE1lYYEuvrfST.png?height=768&width=1366)\n\nFunding from the Pumpkin Spice Arcology sales will launch an extensive research-and-visit-based project to push the experience of my born digital spaces into lasting works that impact viewers’ everyday experience of their own physical spaces.

Dirt is unique in that it funds its authors via NFTs of editions. It was natural to me to think of my Sims builds and their stories as art in the NFT space because of their innately liminal ontology. They are real architectural spaces and real worlds to the viewer—but they aren’t physically instantiated in our own world, so the non-fungible nature of the token lends itself to the medium’s ontological status.\n\n### TOOLS\n\nThe Sims 4, in which I build the structures and worlds central to my work, in many ways embodies the peak pre-\"late capitalist\" suburban aesthetic of the early 2000s, before the financial crash. The game is structured to facilitate building largely residential, private family homes, and to incentivize filling them with in-game possessions that increase in price and desirability as a Sim makes more income through fame or salary.\n\n![A typical Sims 3 interior included in MoMa's Applied Design exhibition in 2013. Attributed to original game designer Will Wright.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/91v1ZcaWOEN7BfYDsFgsx.jpg?height=598&width=800)\n\nWhat I enjoy most about the Sims 4 is using it explicitly contrary to this purpose. I design against the grain of the game’s built-in assumptions about what architecture should be. While much digital work in socially mediated gamespaces (including my own) is indebted both to the exhibition practices and media theory writing of Hito Steyerl, my work is in some ways best compared to the *[Drawing Restraint](https://www.frieze.com/article/matthew-barney-1)* series of performances by Matthew Barney.

That includes an interview with Glam Beckett, the artist behind [Sad Girls Bar](https://sadgirlsbar.io/).\n\n— In-depth coverage of the hyped slate of fall / winter TV shows returning after quarantine, like Succession and Brian Ng on Squid Games.\n\n— A series of new NFT drops already in development, including collaborations with other publications and clothing and design companies.\n\n— During Season 2, all past Dirt NFTs will be re-minted on OpenSea and airdropped to collectors in order to centralize the Dirt Collection and secondary market.\n\n## Dirt DAO Roadmap\n\n1. Our next step for Dirt after Season 2 will be to launch DirtDAO, which will be a fully crypto-native digital media company. All $DIRT-S1 token holders will be airdropped double their current tokens in final $DIRT DAO tokens.\n2. The DAO will have governance of Dirt as a publication, deciding which editorial subject areas to cover and how to grow, as well as where to invest funding. It’s like being a member of a fan club or creating a think tank. We expect to launch the DAO in early 2022 with a large-scale avatar project-style drop.\n3. DirtDAO will also control a Dirt Gallery NFT collection, deciding which pieces to acquire to build a community-driven institution.\n4. Plans for Dirt in the future include livestreamed digital events via Discord, IRL readings, and a physical studio / hangout space for Dirt in Brooklyn, where we’ll record podcasts and produce TikTok video essays.\n5. All Dirt development is directed toward the growth of Dirt as an authoritative brand for digital media and for NFTs and crypto culture.\n\n**Keep Dirt running by buying the [Dirty S2 Summer Vibe NFT here](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/20331478546256365083689063527039864327720174751810602029774601716986531545188).**", "timestamp": 1633361472, "digest": "ns7AYkU8eYPI9RcbQCEdpRUGi0d3458cRw7WSXrmaPI", "contributor": "0x25cbCFA16e43e58517f80D583087Ea89241293E6"}

Click [here](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/2aWOCnFgLTRePfJn4C2P8RgmYh_I0VbPcColjQTtcJ8) to learn more about Pathfinders and our role in the decentralization of RabbitHole.*** \n\nLast Wednesday, Twitter software engineer [Mada Aflak](https://twitter.com/af_mada) posted a quick demo of the NFT authentication tool that the company is building. After downloading their NFTs from OpenSea, users can put their NFT in their avatar, and if properly authenticated, a customary checkmark will appear alongside the NFT to show that they are the “true owner” of the image. \n\n[https://twitter.com/af_mada/status/1443243702156206089](https://twitter.com/af_mada/status/1443243702156206089)\n\nTwitter’s addition of this NFT overlay is likely to bring a tremendous amount of exposure to the space. Some may feel like we’re already at the top, but web2’s implementation of incremental technologies like these could mark the beginning of another period of NFT acceleration. \n\nAnd while the feature is still in development, a somewhat controversial response has already unfolded: The anti-crypto crowd is threatening to “block” anyone who uses the badge. And those within the community are torn between whether it’s just a visible representation of the elitism that already exists in crypto, or if Twitter’s integration of the tool would work to hard-wire division in a community built on the premise of decentralization. \n\nWhether you love it, hate it, or think it’s absolutely not going to work, it’s important to keep in mind the implications of the technology that we are creating–specifically, the movement of status and scarcity into the digital world. \n\n### NFTs as a status symbol \n\nFlaunting a Bored Ape or CryptoPunk as your pfp has become akin to wearing a fancy watch or rare sneakers; or, as one two-time Bored Ape owner puts it, “It’s like having a [Harvard degree in the NFT space](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/why-bored-ape-avatars-are-taking-over-twitter).” \n\nAnd while status symbols can be anything that connote a high social position, to function effectively, [W. David Marx](https://twitter.com/wdavidmarx) describes them as needing three key properties: signaling costs, alibis, and cachet. \n\n1. **Signaling costs:** The act of acquisition must be difficult so that “possession serves as [proof of exceptional assets or privilege](https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-are-nfts-status-symbols).” In the case of NFTs, and to put it bluntly, this means that you were either early or you’re rich. \n2. **Alibis:** People need an excuse to own what the boomers refer to as “JPEGs.” Those who buy a $20M house for a three-person family blame it on “shelter.” NFT-collectors could justify their expenditures on the basis of a long-term investment, or better yet, utility as an investment (think ticketed access to a closed Discord channel). \n3. **Cachet:** Status symbols must identify a symbolic association with a high-status group. This goes back to the pfp as your Harvard degree comment–both within and outside the community, NFT pfps could signal a “[deep knowledge in crypto](https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-are-nfts-status-symbols), investment prowess, and familiarity with cutting-edge pop culture.”\n\n### Scarcity in the digital world \n\nBy virtue of being digital, NFTs can be replicated endlessly and costlessly. To the naked eye, there is no difference between an NFT-secured piece of digital art and the one that you might rip off of the Internet. \n\nBut then again, there have been scammers since the beginning of time. So, “what is the actual difference between an [original piece of art and a perfectly executed replica](https://stratechery.com/2021/apples-point-of-view-nfts-and-status-nfts-and-standard-formats/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiIyNGtvZ3h3V205OXZVV3J3Z2kyaWQ0IiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDIxL2FwcGxlcy1wb2ludC1vZi12aWV3LW5mdHMtYW5kLXN0YXR1cy1uZnRzLWFuZC1zdGFuZGFyZC1mb3JtYXRzLyJdfSwiZXhwIjoxNjMyOTcyNTYzLCJpYXQiOjE2MjI2Mzc2MzQsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vc3RyYXRlY2hlcnkucGFzc3BvcnQub25saW5lL29hdXRoIiwic2NvcGUiOiJhcnRpY2xlOnJlYWQgZmVlZDpyZWFkIGFzc2V0OnJlYWQiLCJzdWIiOiIyNGtvZ3h3V205OXZVV3J3Z2kyaWQ0QGFwcGxpY2F0aW9ucyIsInVzZSI6ImZlZWQifQ.eO3NUT577mQFQ1GPNtAToMcO9lPbhppT5PRb8wdjpPm5uYBHAh0pW6lgRKLnszWMtobFZ9C_kH665CCgrlLNkOAuMfw-nIUdAW7-Bm0_OMmPCQA7tYFGHuJdbUfIL2f8kTyc6Tydz2xL69KpnpFqpUm6kr6j1Xqa9-3kSiYByS4jVNQQW8-TZgbiNHD2rRuk_rWwCa9Egvli-jJ8nMcIOxIB2VuuCb655BiJdyZ4Q5w9MlAG2SSmFbHGVxqGyYqGqrALCg9D3Ldj8E_EYVjx9SmVzzDZV_8ZP2Q6KgXOT0h4q2USA7xF9znOZlEsOdsk5iFbhxIZcZ-GN-8OgfsD5w)?” \n\nAccording to 20th-century philosopher [Walter Benjamin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin), the answer could lie in the art’s “[aura](https://mycourses2.mcgill.ca/content/enforced/532251-5606.202109/Benjamin_Walter_1936_2008_The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Its_Technological_Reproducibility.pdf?_&d2lSessionVal=sTqWUq1oMiilfoPUlVOGkTDF3),” which he defines as “a strange tissue of space and time: the unique apparition of a distance, however near it may be.” While it’s technologically possible to create thousands of copies of the Mona Lisa, for example, none will replace the original. Standing in front of the real piece, knowing that it was touched by greatness and enveloped in history, is essential to its appeal–and market value. \n\nWhat is so great about an NFT is that, unlike the Mona Lisa, it is not confined to the walls of the Louvre. While technological reproduction erodes a piece of art’s ‘aura,’ this is ultimately a good thing as it allows for art to be brought closer to the public, and thus, to be democratized. \n\nWidespread visual access to and sharing of NFTs has become fundamental to this new-generation participatory culture of art. \n\n### An evolution of art’s “aura” \n\nBut this brings me back to my first point: NFTs as a status symbol. \n\nThe ability to transfer an NFT anywhere, and display an NFT anywhere–even in multiple locations at once–means that the status-flaunting aspects of owning a, say, CryptoPunk can be shared. \n\nSo, why the obsession over verification of ownership? I get it, people want their NFT Harvard degree, but I think a connection to a historical and emotional moment in time is more important than bragging rights. Better yet, NFTs as a utility will open up a whole new world of possibility. \n\n*Written by [@anay_sim. ](https://twitter.com/anay_sim)*\n\n### New Pathfinder guides: \n\nHard to follow that essay by Anay, but I’ll do my best and keep this brief.

[london.pob.studio](https://london.pob.studio)*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9uGUzzQ9tCSPwKcv03fOu.png?height=1000&width=2000)\n\n\n---\n\n## Stirrings at the LONDON slums\n\nLONDON had many names before it was given the moniker it has today. There was no intention for an ERC20 token, a DAO, or any capacity to be historically relevant. The first murmurs of the project concept was actually called IMPASSE. At the time, we were not aware of the LONDON hard-fork and more so unaware of what lies in POB studios future. \n\n![A spitball from February 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y_ULC7EeB5uS40518sCt6.png?height=282&width=1208)\n\nWe were a rag tag bunch of NFT creators in a space that just started to figure its own bearings around NFT projects. We managed to hit a home-run with [HASH](hash.pob.studio) and the community loved it. We had so much more to say around HASH and eager to say it. We were NOT planning for any other project after [HASH](hash.pob.studio) for the year. We had our focus on S1: SAGA, the Historians DAO, and growing the project at large. \n\nEven with our focus on HASH, we continued to explore other ideas and we had a personal affiliation with the idea of playing around gas prices. Gas prices were honestly a perfect meme: it was consistently shitted upon by the community, and our relationship with it was rather 1 dimensional, if its up, its expensive and ‘bad’, if it’s down, it’s cheap and less ‘bad’.\n\nWe were aware very early that a project that plays around gas prices was a golden opportunity for the studio. Nobody was thinking about gas prices as an integral part of the NFT art experience; everybody was just trying to mitigate gas wars. To that, we eventually drafted a full spec for this ‘Gas price project’ and called it MINT.\n\n![MINT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bBuiFkt4VIaMr3IrqqN90.png?height=1498&width=1386)\n\nTLDR: MINT was a simple collection of NFTs that were mint-able only at an exclusively low gas price. There were no ERC20 token, hard-fork interaction in the original spec. It did have the ambitions to be a grand social experiment held with crypto mechanics.\n\nAs much as we were elated with the MINT concept, there was one aspect of the project that stuck out as a sore thumb.\n\nOne of the key design features of MINT was that it had to ‘end’ after some time. The project can not allow minting into perpetuity because of the temporal quality of MINT. The project was about gas price and manipulating it, so when the manipulation occurred is very important.\n\nFor example, if a 1 gwei txn for MINT were to occur during a 100 gwei average gas price environment would be a completely different story then a 1 gwei txn during a 15 gwei gas price environment.\n\nThe project needed an era of time that was unforgettable and can provide context to the relative difficulty of manipulating the gas prices. To that, we had a bitter taste in our mouth for the MINT project. There was no ceremony to it, no reason for it to end but because MINT demanded of it. It lacked a reason to exist.\n\n### Impulse buying a nonstop flight to LONDON\n\nIt would be months after we drafted the MINT spec and the release of S1: SAGA for HASH that we revisited the conversation of a future project from POB studios. Our focus was still on HASH and shipping the features but we started to get a bit restless for something new. \n\nIn retrospect, there was so much working against LONDON’s existence.  We were still ‘bearish’ on the studio creating a new project. We were well aware of how stretched thinly we would be if we were to start something, and the market was in a ‘NFT hangover’ and we weren’t too eager to release something into the quieter market sentiment.\n\nThat all changed one random lunch break and I was skimming twitter. I kept seeing shill tweets about ETH as a deflationary currency and finally decided to read one of the influencers thread on the subject. Honestly, at the time I made no connection between EIP-1559, the LONDON hard fork to the MINT project. I read the threads largely as a ETH maxi feeling happy about my ETH bags.\n\nIt was a random afternoon grabbing groceries when I decided to read the EIP-1559 spec proper while waiting for the self-checkout line to clear when it started to hit me. LONDON hard-fork was going to ‘get rid’ of gas prices. I was elated because that was what MINT was missing, the hard-fork is the perfect temporal/historic meme that MINT needs to be grafted on. It gave the MINT project a reason to end, a reason to exist in the first place (as a critique of gas prices), and a reason to have value. \n\nThis was a huge light bulb moment. We knew MINT was a once in this year opportunity, but it soon become a once in your LIFETIME opportunity in the form of LONDON. We had the hard-fork coming up in a few months (this moment occurred out in late May) and such a radical change to gas prices wont EVER happen again (maybe when the MERGE occurs).\n\nI wish this moment was something from the movies, some moment of triumph and then a swift building montage to success. In reality, it was a very sobering moment. LONDON needed to exist, and POB studios might just be the only folks who will do it. That meant that, at whatever means necessary, we needed to find the time to ship LONDON. \n\nBut before we start slinging code, we need to figure out exactly what we are building. \n\n\n---\n\n*This is Part 1 of 3 on the story of LONDON. A story that I look back at fondly but in the moment was filled with its moment of stress and terror. Stay tuned for part 2 were we talk about the birth of $LONDON and the build up to the hard fork*\n\n## ", "timestamp": 1633383413, "digest": "irz3_d01n81GMHW_kZNuVEZJGhfIyh6jejSoESTu5YY", "contributor": "0x9428ca8b5fe52C33BD0BD7222d719d788B6467F4"}

{"id": "RpKbia2M4Cip6Z76IYoN7lt1BF6S0cAjplYSz9lB7KQ", "title": "Artificial scarcity isn't bad and it's not just a jpeg (on NFTs)", "body": "This piece addresses two common questions and critiques about NFTs:\n\n* “It’s just a jpeg everyone can see, so anyone paying for it is \\[delusional / getting scammed / etc\\].”\n* “The internet’s supposed to be about abundance - why are we creating unnecessary artificial scarcity and financializing everything?.”\n\nGiven music’s history with ubiquity, including the economic effects of the sudden shift from paid to free post-piracy, I think these are two excellent critiques to explore the value of NFTs in general and for music specifically.\n\n## Participation\n\nOne of my own, biggest critiques of what happened to music in the 20th century is that music’s default shifted from communal to individual, from participative to consumerist, from folk to personalized. This happened through the proliferation of the recording and record players to every house, then every room of the house and eventually everyone’s pocket until even the music played from streaming services would be atomized to personalized playlists that fit an individual’s taste exactly.\n\nThis had great economic consequences for the recording industry, which eventually dwarfed other parts of the music industry like publishers. It also created a framework through which corporations own and govern the majority of contemporary culture. If you think about folk songs as songs that an entire population knows, or just subsets thereof, then pop music has essentially replaced folk. Folk music was communally owned and iterative. Pop music is, typically, corporate-owned and there will be 1 official version: everything else is ‘derivative’, less authentic, less ‘real’, than the ‘original’. In that sense, [Seven Nation Army](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J2QdDbelmY) could be considered a folk song, especially in countries where it’s a common chant in football (‘soccer’ 🇺🇸) stadiums.\n\nDon’t get me wrong: I think many of these aspects brought great attributes to music too, but it’s important to consider which other attributes, like the ones mentioned above, got [deemphasised](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2017/05/01/the-future-of-music-inspired-by-a-cheap-vietnamese-restaurant-in-berlin/) and moved into the background of our default music experience.\n\nBack to artificial scarcity and abundance.\n\nThe time we live in is amazing. We have so much of humanity’s knowledge and cultural expression at our fingertips. We have simple, digital tools at our disposal that allow us to express ourselves through any modern type of media: image, sound, video, augmented reality (think TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram when it’s not down). After being locked out of participative culture because of decades of a creator / consumer divide, we may soon see [a billion music creators](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/09/30/one-billion-music-creators-what-does-that-look-like/). So why be so excited about something that introduces scarcity?\n\n## Open scarcity\n\nThe exciting thing about NFTs is that you can let everyone access the media, yet assign the ownership of the NFT that represents the media to one person. This is not that dissimilar from video games: your friend may have unlocked a certain skin that is purely cosmetic and does not affect gameplay. You can enjoy this skin while you play with your friend: even if they’re the ones who paid for it.\n\nNFTs can be used in similar dynamics. Sometimes they’re used as vehicles for [crowdfunding](https://chaim.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x0421f42eb7BD74774a09bD3454C6948A938324E9). They can bring media (or culture) into existence that wouldn’t exist otherwise. One patron, one NFT. And a jpeg or mp3 for millions to enjoy.\n\nMP3s, for a long time, held a real price of $0. Most people would download them and wouldn’t pay for it. Streaming, unfortunately for many artists, hasn’t helped them to attain a significant income. This may be due to a number of factors, but the fact is that for a long time music has been a game with just one mode to play it. If you don’t fit that mode well, it’s going to be hard and the factors are often outside of musicians’ control. The major exception I can think of is the period before recorded music revenues bounced back to pre-piracy days, which kind of forced people to get creative. Besides contemporary streaming giants, two of the more popular crowdfunding platforms were born in this period: **Kickstarter** (2009) and **Patreon** (2013).\n\n![Graph: IFPI Global Music Report 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9EHfMYnagnfeogYltpRJX.png?height=789&width=1099)\n\nIf we use the phrase ‘NFT’ to mean works of art (music, visual, both) then NFTs create an amazing situation where content no longer needs to be locked behind a paywall on a platform like Patreon. Instead, the proliferation of the media associated with the NFT, for example a song, will increase the value of the NFT. This also impacts the perceived value of future NFT drops.\n\nOwnership is exclusive, but the media is abundant. It’s open scarcity.\n\n## But why pay if it’s free anyway?\n\nThere are many motivations why people pay for NFTs. Some people are purely speculating, but I don’t think that’s the important part of the story. Some are collectors. A web2 example I can think of is **Bandcamp**: for some releases you can get the free download, but if you pay $0.50 it also shows up in your collection. I love building my collection on Bandcamp, so I’ll pay for the free jpeg and mp3 to be there. \n\nMost importantly, **NFTs are decentralized social media**. They are objects that exist in a social context. This social context is powered by the blockchain on which the NFTs sit, plus any social media an NFT holder might use. In this context, possessing an NFT holds meaning to the owner, because it can signify social value, taste, distinction, membership, or identity, just like people’s clothing or [virtual skins in video games](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/02/08/nfts-are-blockchains-hottest-new-use-case-for-music-they-should-not-come-as-a-surprise/). All of that is portable to any social context they move to.\n\nIt’s that social aspect that gives these objects value and in many cases the social value would be greatly diminished it the object was not freely accessible for all to see.\n\n## Financializing all the things…\n\nFinally, a conclusion I’ve drawn for myself. I sympathise a lot with the critique that the web3 is financializing everything. Should all these things have a price tag or should the price tag be secondary? Certainly, in this wave of the web3, the price tag has often been the story, but I don’t think it’s the whole story (although to some writers it is).\n\nThe real story is that value can be tracked and it can be made transparent. People who create value can participate in it. All these interactions we have with each other online, all this culture we’re accessing: it’s already financialized. The companies that host our conversations, our art, our expression, they have shareholders, they sell ads. The difference with the web3 is that 1) we don’t know what interactions are worth, and 2) we don’t participate in the value they create.\n\nThat’s different now.\n\nFrom here we have options. We can choose to express things in tokens or cryptocurrency. We can choose not to. We can choose to distribute equally to all participants or reward those who contribute more. We can choose governance models where it’s one person, one vote, or where people can vote based on their stake (e.g. number of tokens held). We can choose the game we play - this has not happened since that 2009 to 2013 period that spawned so many of the current status quo.\n\nThese systems are in our hands now. There’s no one-size fits all platform. Instead we’re stringing the tools together to create brand new configurations to design communities the way we see fit. Different subcultures will emerge in the space. They already have. For example, [Zora](https://zora.co/) is a radically different NFT marketplace (and more) from [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/). Just compare their positioning: “[THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD OWN US](https://zora.co/manifesto)” versus “The World's Fastest Growing Crypto App”.\n\nAuctioned digital cultural objects, as NFTs, have an important role to play in online culture in the next ten years. Music piracy paved the way for streaming. Streaming paved the way for microgenres on SoundCloud to playlist edits on Spotify to the meme-like behaviour of music on TikTok.\n\nNow a web3 layer is going to start providing a new context. Let’s add social context to those mp3s and jpegs.", "timestamp": 1633388123, "digest": "4f0MFsdZ24wFfyc09RLFzRVVNe5vmYD_b4bjpU5aKAQ", "contributor": "0xe612d9C2a9bA0Ff4403F4f7Ea87D5bE4290aC7B9"}
{"id": "9GULckvDIMzLHldDCVOkC-cV-s2rpVofVnPU-uxML-s", "title": "Artificial scarcity isn't bad and it's not just a jpeg (on NFTs)", "body": "This piece addresses two common questions and critiques about NFTs:\n\n* “It’s just a jpeg everyone can see, so anyone paying for it is \\[delusional / getting scammed / etc\\].”\n* “The internet’s supposed to be about abundance - why are we creating unnecessary artificial scarcity and financializing everything?.”\n\nGiven music’s history with ubiquity, including the economic effects of the sudden shift from paid to free post-piracy, I think these are two excellent critiques to explore the value of NFTs in general and for music specifically.\n\n## Participation\n\nOne of my own, biggest critiques of what happened to music in the 20th century is that music’s default shifted from communal to individual, from participative to consumerist, from folk to personalized. This happened through the proliferation of the recording and record players to every house, then every room of the house and eventually everyone’s pocket until even the music played from streaming services would be atomized to personalized playlists that fit an individual’s taste exactly.\n\nThis had great economic consequences for the recording industry, which eventually dwarfed other parts of the music industry like publishers. It also created a framework through which corporations own and govern the majority of contemporary culture. If you think about folk songs as songs that an entire population knows, or just subsets thereof, then pop music has essentially replaced folk. Folk music was communally owned and iterative. Pop music is, typically, corporate-owned and there will be 1 official version: everything else is ‘derivative’, less authentic, less ‘real’, than the ‘original’. In that sense, [Seven Nation Army](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J2QdDbelmY) could be considered a folk song, especially in countries where it’s a common chant in football (‘soccer’ 🇺🇸) stadiums.\n\nDon’t get me wrong: I think many of these aspects brought great attributes to music too, but it’s important to consider which other attributes, like the ones mentioned above, got [deemphasised](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2017/05/01/the-future-of-music-inspired-by-a-cheap-vietnamese-restaurant-in-berlin/) and moved into the background of our default music experience.\n\nBack to artificial scarcity and abundance.\n\nThe time we live in is amazing. We have so much of humanity’s knowledge and cultural expression at our fingertips. We have simple, digital tools at our disposal that allow us to express ourselves through any modern type of media: image, sound, video, augmented reality (think TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram when it’s not down). After being locked out of participative culture because of decades of a creator / consumer divide, we may soon see [a billion music creators](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/09/30/one-billion-music-creators-what-does-that-look-like/). So why be so excited about something that introduces scarcity?\n\n## Open scarcity\n\nThe exciting thing about NFTs is that you can let everyone access the media, yet assign the ownership of the NFT that represents the media to one person. This is not that dissimilar from video games: your friend may have unlocked a certain skin that is purely cosmetic and does not affect gameplay. You can enjoy this skin while you play with your friend: even if they’re the ones who paid for it.\n\nNFTs can be used in similar dynamics. Sometimes they’re used as vehicles for [crowdfunding](https://chaim.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x0421f42eb7BD74774a09bD3454C6948A938324E9). They can bring media (or culture) into existence that wouldn’t exist otherwise. One patron, one NFT. And a jpeg or mp3 for millions to enjoy.\n\nMP3s, for a long time, held a real price of $0. Most people would download them and wouldn’t pay for it. Streaming, unfortunately for many artists, hasn’t helped them to attain a significant income. This may be due to a number of factors, but the fact is that for a long time music has been a game with just one mode to play it. If you don’t fit that mode well, it’s going to be hard and the factors are often outside of musicians’ control. The major exception I can think of is the period before recorded music revenues bounced back to pre-piracy days, which kind of forced people to get creative.

{"id": "hy4PvIhPX6q5SS1ch2fXLRgj7Lvzh3L06aMAS8etPqU", "title": "Understanding Ethereum", "body": "Before you start reading this article, it would be helpful to have a basic understanding of a blockchain and how bitcoin works. If you’d like to read about bitcoin, I wrote about [understanding bitcoin](https://jenil.substack.com/p/understanding-bitcoin) earlier on this newsletter.\n\n## Ethereum\n\nQuick facts about Ethereum:\n\n* Number 2 cryptocurrency by market cap. (**Not** why I am writing about it.)\n* Core developers - Vitalik Buterin (creator) , Gavin Wood\n* Block 0 mined July 30, 2015\n\n[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) is a distributed network of nodes executing smart contracts (programmed logic or bytecode) and storing the resultant state of that smart contract on a blockchain. Given the immutable, tamper-proof, and transparent nature of a blockchain, the application state runs verifiably without any downtime. For a more detailed version of this, you can also watch this 25 min [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66SaEDzlmP4) on ethereum.\n\n#### So, what is a smart contract?\n\nA smart contract is a piece of code that is immutable in nature and runs deterministically on the ethereum network. The executed code and the resultant state of this code is stored on the blockchain, so participants on the network can verify or interact with that state. I repeat that the state is immutable because, anyone can double check that the current state is correct by replaying all of the transactions from the beginning of the chain.\n\nParticipants in the network can interact with that smart contract through a smart contract address (eg. 0x985dd3d42de1e256d09e1c10f112bccb8015ad41). The multi-sig wallets used to store, send and receive ETH (externally owned accounts - EOA’s), are accounts associated to an entity (secured with a private key), and essentially are just smart contracts with an intuitive UI executing these functions.\n\nIf you would like to explore transactions happened in the past, and monitor what’s happening on the network, feel free to check out [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x837f6701e244a0a3a401290bd26ae28873c40d571e0b9b7631364789feb1d0f3) or other similar block explorers.\n\n*Source - Etherscan.io*\n\n## Gas\n\nGiven that smart contracts are executed by every single full node on the network (in context to the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-ethereum-virtual-machine-how-does-it-work-9abac2b7c9e)), this is a very computationally expensive operation and costs money. Gas is an abstract unit of this computational cost attributed to performing an operation on the ethereum network, like interacting with a contract, storing data, executing a transaction and many others. The price of how much gas you pay is determined by the market (if you pay a higher gas price, your transaction will be prioritized by the nodes on the network).\n\nThere’s also a gas-limit enforced by the network for situations where a program never ends ([Halting problem ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem)).\n\n## Decentralized Applications (dApps)\n\nA dApp is one or more smart contracts (on the server-side, deployed on the ethereum network) with a UI on the frontend (**dApp Client**) for users to interact with the smart contract.\n\nThe dApp doesn’t have to store all of it’s state on the blockchain, given how expensive it can get in terms of gas to store a whole bunch on information on the network. Instead, dApps can store on what’s important or trusted piece of data on the blockchain for anyone to read, verify or interact with. The rest can be stored “off-chain” (outside of the blockchain) or outsourced to technologies like IPFS, Golem, 0Chain, Sia Skynet etc. that can handle the storage in a decentralized manner.\n\n#### dApp Browsers\n\nA dApp browser is an application that makes using dApp Clients easier to interact with, in a seamless manner. (eg. Mist, Status, Metamask, Toshi, Parity)\n\nThe goal of dApp browsers is to:\n\n* Connect remotely with an ethereum node.\n* Provide an account interface or a wallet for users to interact with different dApps.\n\n#### But what is an ethereum node?\n\nEthereum nodes store a copy of the blockchain and execute the transactions from the chain to verify and confirm the resultant state. The node needs to know which blockchain to download and which peers to talk with.\n\n#### Web3 Modules\n\nWeb3.js is a set of modules created for connecting to an Ethereum node. The node only understands JSON RPC, so what web3.js does is transalates the JSON RPC code, so that you can send a JSON object into something that you can easily use in JavaScript.\n\nThe EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) executes based on the generated bytecode from the Ethereum Smart Contract. Web3.js helps translate these functions into ABI (Application Binary Interface) encoding, so that the EVM can understand it, and store the resulting state on the blockchain.\n\n## Ethereum Tokens\n\nEthereum tokens represents a state, where a bunch of ethereum addresses are mapped to an integer.\n\nTokens represent some resource or rights: \n\n* Access rights\n* Placeholder for real-world asset\n* Alternate currency\n* Frequently used for Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).\n\nThese tokens are numbers on a distributed table associated to a protocol, used for incentivizing interaction with a protocol, prove ownership of assets, voting rights, staking etc. With the proliferation of different protocols, a standard spec was coined called ERC20 standard by Fabian Vogelstellar.\n\nThere’s different token standards:\n\n* ERC20: digital alternative to equity\n* ERC721 (Digital Assets): Non-fungible scarce assets, from in-game rewards to real-estate. Non-fungible meaning each token is different and unique from one another in terms of its properties and value.\n* ERC725 (Identity): Present proof of your crypto identity to demonstrate that you posses an asset.\n\n## Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)\n\nDAO is an organization of entities where the governance and decision making is defined and based on a bunch of smart contracts, and these decisions are stored on the blockchain. There’s many entities forming DAOs today and even companies following the logic and governance defined in a smart contract to promote transparency and immutability.\n\nSome popular use cases of DAOs used by companies like Aragon are investments, equity distribution, payroll, accounting, decision making, voting rights and other forms of governance.\n\n## Ethereum Community\n\nIf you’d like to be a part of the community, here’s some resources:\n\nAugur Project Slack: <https://www.hamsterpad.com/chat/augurproject> \\n Ether.Camp Slack: [https://ether-camp-friends.slack.com](https://ether-camp-friends.slack.com/) \\n MakerDAO Slack: [https://makerdao.slack.com](https://makerdao.slack.com/) \\n Gnosis Slack: [https://gnosis-pm.slack.com](https://gnosis-pm.slack.com/) \\n TheDAO Slack: [https://thedao.slack.com](https://thedao.slack.com/)\n\nOr on twitter: [@ethereumproject](https://twitter.com/ethereumproject), [@VitalikButerin](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin), @feindura, @0xjenil \n\n### Finally\n\nIf you’d like to get started with an ETH wallet, I’d recommend - [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/), [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or on Coinbase.", "timestamp": 1633452464, "digest": "buNHjTRE7IoL7LcQvv861h5zqhy558BJXsG7E-d4XPw", "contributor": "0x8df737904ab678B99717EF553b4eFdA6E3f94589"}

According to statistics from OKLink, the amount of decentralized lending in February 2020 was only 200 million U.S. dollars, but now it reaches 8 billion U.S. dollars, a 400% increase in just one year.\n\nHowever, there are big problems with current on-chain lending. Since all on-chain behaviors are permissionless, all interactions follow the rules of the agreement, which also makes on-chain lending limited to the “over-collateralization” mechanism. Generally, the loan agreement requires the user to have a mortgage rate of 150%, which means that if the user wants to lend 1 USD of assets, they need to mortgage 1.5 USD of assets.\n\nSince the amount of liquidity in the economy will directly affect the growth rate of the economy, and over-collateralization directly limits the currency multiplier, this also limits the expansion rate of the DeFi economy to some extent.\n\nOn-chain lending without the blessing of the credit system can only serve leveraged traders and currency holders who need funds but are unwilling to give up positions. Those who really need funds but do not have capital cannot borrow from decentralized lending. Benefit.\n\nTherefore, if you want to enlarge the volume of encrypted finance, allow encrypted assets to break the circle into the traditional lending market, and allow more people to benefit from encrypted assets, the excessively high asset mortgage rate is a problem that must be solved. However, it is very difficult to solve this problem purely from the on-chain mechanism. We need to connect the on-chain and off-chain worlds. Goldfinch has given a set of solutions.\n\nSince the launch of the Goldfinch Agreement in December last year, Goldfinch has lent assets worth $100 to users in developing countries in Mexico, Nigeria, and Southeast Asia.\n\n## Goldfinch bridging tradition with on-chain finance\n\nThe Goldfinch agreement will grant lending institutions a credit line, and the lending institution can borrow stablecoins from the agreement’s fund pool through the credit line. After the institution obtains the stable currency, the stable currency is exchanged for legal currency and the legal currency is lent to its users through traditional channels. In this way, the offline market can fully enjoy the value of the assets on the chain, and the value of the assets on the chain will be infinitely amplified. All off-chain debt issuance, underwriting and related businesses will be handled by relevant professional institutions.\n\nEncrypted asset holders will play the role of the fund provider in the agreement, and the token holders will deposit tokens in the fund pool and receive income. Whenever the lending institution returns interest and principal to the agreement, all funds will be repaid to the fund provider in real time.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*zjtokTpUlrvjLyoTVQCAlA.png)\n\n## Goldfinch’s imagination\n\nIn just three months, Goldfinch has reached cooperation with PAYJOY in Mexico and QuickCheck in Nigeria, and successfully issued a loan of US$1 million.\n\nIn the future, Goldfinch’s goal is to become a fully decentralized credit platform. However, since it is now in the initial phase of the agreement, certain steps need to be centralized.\n\nNow Goldfinch is more like a credit fund, and the Goldfinch team will be the underwriter responsible for reviewing the qualifications of off-chain lending institutions. However, in the future, all users will be able to become underwriters and lend funds in the form of primary bonds. Because of the high risk, users will get higher returns than other priority bond investors.\n\nIn terms of off-chain, in the future, not only well-qualified lending institutions will be able to obtain funds from the agreement, but individuals can also apply for credit directly from the agreement, ultimately building Goldfinch into a completely decentralized credit platform. For example, companies can directly apply for loans from the agreement to expand production and operations. Ordinary users get funds from the agreement just like using a credit card. All of this will be possible in the future.\n\nIn the de-banking Web3.0 world, the resistance generated by various financial intermediaries will be minimized, but this also makes the credit information system more important. The credit reporting system is the key to releasing the upper limit of liquidity. Without the support of a complete credit reporting system, unsecured lending will still be a false proposition.\n\n## team member\n\nGoldfinch’s co-founder Michael Sall graduated from the Wharton School of Business and served as a product manager at Adobe and the head of the data science department at Medium.

Mirror has evolved from a tool for writers to a full-stack web3 creative suite for communities and DAOs.\n\nMore than ever, we believe that every creative project starts with a story. Our goal is to make Mirror the best place to share your story with the world and build a highly-engaged community around it, powered by world-class crypto-native tools.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/X3jHDWCza8Yu9rS5gizJH.png?height=1142&width=2284&&&&&size=medium)\n\nToday, we’re opening up decentralized publishing on Mirror to anybody with an Ethereum address. Anyone can connect their wallet and [start writing](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard).\n\nWhy does decentralized publishing matter? We believe the core principles guiding Mirror development answer this question:\n\n### Identity and data is owned by users\n\nWhen you use Mirror, you log in with your Ethereum wallet instead of a username and password. This means your account is owned by you and lives on an open blockchain instead of a centralized database. [All data published on Mirror](https://dev.mirror.xyz/J1RD6UQQbdmpCoXvWnuGIfe7WmrbVRdff5EqegO1RjI) is cryptographically signed by users and stored on permanent decentralized storage (Arweave). This means that data cannot be corrupted or modified by faulty service providers or malicious parties. Permanent storage means that you don’t need to rely on the Mirror team to ensure the longevity or integrity of your content. Most importantly, cryptographically secure and permanent data ensures users can *credibly exit* a platform if it no longer serves their needs or becomes misaligned.\n\n### Crypto rails enable new business models\n\nOnline publishing drives enormous engagement but has been notoriously difficult to monetize in sustainable ways. Because Mirror is built on Ethereum, it natively supports new crypto-native business models around tokens and NFTs. For example, posts on Mirror can be minted as Entry Editions, allowing them to be collectible at different price points while the content remains accessible to all. Entry Editions let writers monetize their work without putting it behind a paywall. At Mirror, we strongly believe that high quality, popular content is worth much more than $0, and [early](https://linda.mirror.xyz/df649d61efb92c910464a4e74ae213c4cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d) [experiments](https://notboring.mirror.xyz/rPk2Ozej8JHZZ_qayaekCfc1OUUHkmzLtZF3axlfmok) [with](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/VTLvmo0xzs6I9YFIN2f7EZna-Zj4tNIEbF7RVpJOS7s) Entry Editions have validated this thesis.\n\n### Every DAO needs a home\n\nIf a DAO doesn’t have a credit card in the physical world, how can it start a website or access cloud service providers? There are many DAOs with vibrant communities and significant treasuries, but they are not recognized as first class entities by the web2 ecosystem of creative and developer tools. Every crypto-native entity needs a website, and Mirror lets any DAO onboard with a multisig wallet to start sharing its story with the world. In a sense, Mirror bridges a web3 entity into web2 distribution of ideas. This is crucial for DAO success, since most audiences still engage on web2 platforms like Twitter. Collaborative publishing between web3 entities is [natively supported](https://dev.mirror.xyz/WPnZICvS2XbHJQ3u-GrsvYqios3XWmZhQvTKEyUJOGE) on Mirror today.\n\n### Permissionless innovation\n\nBecause publishing on Mirror is underpinned by an open protocol where data is stored on blockchains, developers don’t need permission to extend the system and build on top of the data. While there is still a lot of work to do to create word-class documentation, APIs, and developer libraries, there are already exciting community projects building on top of Mirror, like [Mirror Latest](https://mirror-latest.non-standard.net/), [RSS3](https://twitter.com/pass3dotme/status/1445182948454453255), and [Yup](https://app.yup.io/?feed=mirror).\n\n### Uncompromised UX\n\nCrypto empowers creators and communities with robust economic tools, but we don’t think that should come with added complexity or poor user experience. The Mirror client has been architected to provide a snappy and beautiful interface, underpinned by a statically rendered site powered by Next.js and a performant API. Posting and editing on Mirror feels instant, while data asynchronously commits to permanent decentralized storage in the background. While we think the Mirror client is the easiest way to get started, users always have the option to create their own frontend or use a different client because data and identity on Mirror is credibly open and neutral.\n\n\n---\n\nOver the next few weeks, we’ll continue opening up economic blocks and shipping frequent updates to the publishing experience, such as:\n\n* **Editor updates.** Our users have called Mirror a “web3 Notion”, where you can easily embed economic participation into your narrative. We plan to improve the richness of the editor and support more ways for you to engage your community.\n* **ENS name + slug support.** Currently, URLs are long and include hard to read hashes. We’re adding support for using your ENS name and custom entry slugs so your post can look like this: `https://mirror.xyz/vitalik.eth/on-quadratic-funding`.\n* **Subscriptions.** Subscriptions are table stakes for publishing. Many community members have asked for email delivery and token gated access to content. We don’t have any concrete plans yet, but it’s something we’re thinking about.\n* **Feeds and discovery.** Giving every user and project on Mirror a beautiful homepage and ways for others to discover their work.\n* **Custom dates.** This will allow people to migrate their blogs from other platforms while maintaining a record of when it was published.\n\nTo get started with Mirror, connect to your [Dashboard](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard), check out the [Guide](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide), and join the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/UPuBefXE).\n\n### A note on Mirror Membership\n\nAs the Mirror tools open up for anyone to use, this milestone is an opportunity to redefine the meaning of community membership.

Há muito tempo venho percebendo que minha ansiedade social se intensifica muito quando falo em público. Mas o problema não é durante a fala. É depois. Um pensamento inflexível fica me assombrando: talvez eu tenha falado demais, certamente falei alguma merda, todos vão me odiar por isso, todos vão me desprezar por pensar assim, falar assim. Em seguida, uma vergonha absurda se apodera do meu corpo. Carrego esse sentimento de culpa por dias seguidos depois da fala. Mesmo falas curtas me assombram assim. Passo o dia inteiro trabalhando, sem falar mais que o mínimo (seis ou sete frases por dia, é a média - alguns dias não falo absolutamente uma palavra). Naturalmente, quando chego em casa começo a falar falar falar. E todos os mais de mil pensamentos que me atingiram no dia, disformes até então, vão ganhando corpo, vão se estruturando em frase atrás de frases. Ensaios. E minha esposa às vezes só para de me ouvir. Ou diz: Você fala demais. Vou percebendo que falo muito, e falo muita besteira. E isso é um tipo de maldição. Invejo as pessoas que são convidadas a falar, a palestrar. Nos poucos minutos que tenho de fala nos meus dias, eu erro, desperdiço. Preciso falar menos. Escrever mais. É, a solução é essa: escrever mais. A escrita tem algo de permamente e voluntário que a fala não tem. Tenho que voltar ao meu diário. Sempre abandono meus diários. Mas vou voltar. Não para registrar tudo que aconteceu nos dias, mais para escrever esses ensaios, esses pensamentos, por mais bobos e absurdos. E evitar que qualquer frase se forme quando estiver com amigos, familiares, conhecidos. Assim vou falar menos, talvez consiga a proeza de não falar mais que dez frases por dia. Talvez assim as pessoas com quem convivo gostem mais de mim, e mais pessoas passem a gostar de mim. Falar pouco pelo menos deve resolver toda essa vergonha e culpa que venho carregando.", "timestamp": 1633453536, "digest": "TRCktYpCFD3gsMYIovbo4GjN3ZmIEgRIQGyfutRkC2A", "contributor": "0x22a4A99A08234107767b76daB3d4f7919e0947e2"}
{"id": "NOVCWnxpxPmTgXYCRXVATJBNbYUKM-CyRUKgTna81Ns", "title": "#1  Here comes RSS3", "body": "The right to create, disseminate and distribute information should not be in the hands of centralized governing. It is the basic right of cyber lives.\n\nGradually over the past two decades, contents and links have been controlled by several data superpowers, who then eats all the profits, privacy and freedom. This centralization also resulted in a terrible environment of user experience innovations: No matter how well your design and engineer your application, there is no way to compete with the data monopolies.\n\nThe world has been eager for a new way of constructing social and content networks. RSS used to be the pioneer of its time, now it's time for us to pick up the baton and carry on.\n\nDerived from the best out of RSS, RSS3 is an open protocol designed for content and social networks in the Web 3.0 era.\n\n## The Ideologies We Carry\n\n### Open Source\n\nIt goes without saying that the whole RSS3 project, including the standard and protocol itself and all other supporting layers like hosting and indexing should be open source. Everyone should have the right to inspect and understand what the code is and how it works. Also, being open-source gives all developers a direct way to contribute to all parts of the project.\n\nWe will encourage all applications that utilize the protocol to be open-source as well. Otherwise, users won't be trusting them with their valuable private keys. Chances are that malicious and non-open-source applications will be eliminated by market competitions while data monopoly no longer exists.\n\nRight now, people are forced to trust centralized parties for what a internet service actually does. There are of course big brands to trust, like Facebook, Google or Amazon. People used to have the idea that \"big brands won't cheat\", but recent incidents have all reminded us that giving anyone the chance to do evil is equally dangerous. We need transparency.\n\n### Distributed Control\n\nThe old RSS was designed to be decentralized but not distributed. And that leads to super sub-centers which still carries too much power similar to centralized architectures. For example, Spotify hosts a great amount of long tail podcasts and, though it still uses RSS for publishing, controls all the RSS files and the audio files.\n\nThe ultimate distributed control is to have every cyber persona control its own data. And this means both indexing files and content file should be under distributed hosting, and the right to edit the files are determined by their key pairs like in Bitcoin or Ethereum. However, it is important to note that this key pair that controls ownership can also be changed by their key holder, which will result in transferring or trading of a certain persona.\n\nThat being said, we still need to keep in mind that general users will take a pretty long time to adopt this idea of keeping ones keys and controlling ones data with them. There will likely be a gradual process which involves efforts from multiple parties.\n\n### Inclusiveness\n\nRSS3 and its applications are determined to win against the old giants, so it has to be inclusive in two major ways.\n\nIt starts with the inclusiveness regarding types of applications. Any content or social network is defined by its content form and network structure, where network structure is determined by type of links and mechanism of discovery. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Whatsapp and TikTok are not that different technically. We need the protocol to support very different types of applications so that innovations can continue to happen.\n\nThen we need the inclusiveness on modules. Whether it is hosting, indexing or monetizing, RSS3 is designed to be extremely open to modules with different functionalities. This gives RSS3 great flexibility and possibility regarding what it can do in the future.\n\n## The Future We Aim\n\n### Empowered Personas\n\nCyber personas will truly have full control regarding the data they produce. Any persona can freely express their thoughts and ideas without being censored by any centralized agency. You can go to any application with your own contents and relationships. No platform can ever force you to labor for it anymore. You, no longer the platform, will be empowered to create, own and monetize.\n\n### Platformless Medias\n\nMedias right now are closely bonded with platforms. Each social media platform has its own social graph and primary form of content. The adoption of RSS3 will give medias a chance to have the largest unified group of subscribers, an efficient monetization channel without platform commission, and a freedom to generate contents of various forms.\n\n### Innovative Applications\n\nInnovations on user experience has slowed down so dramatically as data superpowers continue to grow. We want to rebuild the prosperous ecology of applications for different user experience to emerge. When users control their data, they can easily choose to move to applications with better design and engineering efforts. Unlike competing for the scale and speed of data monopolizing, now applications will be actually competing for user experience.\n\n## The Team We Build\n\nTo achieve what we aimed for, we formed a distributed organization with high standard. Every member works on RSS3 comes from his/her/their/its true belief and passion. We share the culture below:\n\n### Mission\n\nTo Liberates Contents and Links\n\n### Vision\n\nBuild a world where information and its flow are free, secure, efficient and distributed\n\n### Value\n\n* Neutrality\n* Inclusiveness\n* Equality\n* Security\n* Privacy\n* Meticulosity\n\nI first was working on an RSS related app in 2018, which led me to the famous RSS project on Github called RSSHub (<https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub>). The app failed badly and I did not anticipate the experience with that app would do me any favor. I worked on different types of social networks after that and gradually shifted my focus onto decentralized social and content networks. It was not until the second half of 2020, did I suddenly remembered RSSHub and its creator DIYgod (<https://diygod.me/>). I connected with him and decided that we could carry some of the best from RSS and build something better. With great help from suji (<https://twitter.com/suji_yan>), founder at Mask Network, we were able to know more people in the decentralized world and raise our seed round. Suji was actually the first person advised us to change our project name (formerly AIR) to RSS3 :D\n\n## To Conclude...\n\nIt is never easy to build something great. Especially when you are confronting the well established giants. However, as developers, we have a firm belief regarding what is right and what should be done. We must dedicate all what we have to overthrow the old world in order to build a new one.\n\nIf you want to join us, know more about RSS3 or just want to have a talk, we are always happy to connect :D\n\nAll the best ❤️\n\n— Joshua & The RSS3 Team", "timestamp": 1633453561, "digest": "1VcMp_Wgjo64qLn9Jn9jq8JVi5oEGfVHFD9yKkiqVHM", "contributor": "0x8c23B96f2fb77AaE1ac2832debEE30f09da7af3C"}

{"id": "9zg8GayoK6c4lXq70stYk9D8h6T7gtR9dWApd1F7Byw", "title": "A Vision of Ethereum - 2025", "body": "Please consider this as a work of hard science fiction. I had written present tense prose (from 2025’s perspective), but had to rework this post to add in some future tense (i.e. 2021 perspective) for context so it has turned out to be a total mess! So, it’s a terrible work of fiction, but certainly more informative than it was before.\n\n—\n\nEthereum is the global settlement layer. Or more technically, the global security and data availability layer.\n\nThere’s a flourishing ecosystem of external execution layers like rollups and volitions building on Ethereum. This is where all the users and dApps are.\n\nThese execution layers are not “just scaling solutions” but vibrant communities, with their own cultures, identities, governance, and economies in their own rights. This is where all the innovation will happen, while Ethereum metamorphosises into an ossified settlement layer. The different communities will be talking with each other, competing but also working together for one seamless whole — Greater Ethereum.\n\nHere’s a nice visualization made by Reddit user [u/emkoscp](https://www.reddit.com/u/emkoscp/) that illustrates this:\n\n![Credit: u/emkoscp](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IV8axKvI-11jtKn2BXGfo.png?height=863&width=1400)\n\nSome will opt for rollups and be fully secured by Ethereum. Some will opt for validiums with centralized data availability, some will be validiums semi-decentralized data availability, i.e. their own consensus mechanism for data availability. Others will give users the choice.\n\nSome will opt to keep self-sovereign sidechains with their own relatively centralized consensus mechanisms without committing any proofs to Ethereum. Even here, there’ll be a spectrum — it could be an alt L1 that’s indifferent and siloed from Ethereum (e.g. Bitcoin), a defacto Ethereum sidechain that’s hostile to Ethereum (Binance Smart Chain) or an Ethereum sidechain that’s friendly to Ethereum (Polygon PoS). While this is a technologically inferior solution to validiums or volitions, marketing, memes and network effects will persist. Given that, the more pragmatic of 2021-era L1s will make a pivot to becoming volitions or rollups, but as mentioned, some will persist with the monolithic blockchain model despite crippling inefficiencies. A possible exception is zkL1s, if they can decentralize enough.\n\n## What about users?\n\n1. **Normie users**: They’ll use some form of centralized aggregator, who will then settle on rollups or on Ethereum directly. Think of it very much like CEXs, except they’ll expand their functionality to integrate DeFi, NFTs, social etc.\n2. **Tech-savvy normie users**: Tech-savvy users who are comfortable with self-custody will use smart contract social recovery wallets. These wallets will be incredibly advanced, with various aggregation mechanisms behind-the-hood for aggregating smart contracts across multiple rollups. Think of a scenario: User deposits fiat to the smart wallet, and wants to earn interest. All they have to do is deposit it. The smart wallet will a) convert to stablecoin, b) deposit automatically to the best interest earning opportunity. Of course, there can be multiple interest aggregation pools like Yearn. All of this will be abstracted from the user. They’ll just see they are earning interest on their fiat! Likewise, most popular dApps will be integrated in the smart wallet, so you don’t need to hop and skip between frontends and rollups.\n3. **Application-specific users**: Some applications will be done entirely on the frontend, with the backend invisible to users. Indeed, we see this happening already with Sorare. Their frontend is indistinguishable from a centralized fantasy sports game, while at the backend they are settling on Sorare’s StarkEx-based validium.\n4. **Enthusiast users**: These users will likely transact directly with rollups. The more cost-sensitive enthusiast will use volitions or validiums.\n5. **Financial instructions, governments, whale NFT collectors**: Finally, there’ll be a very limited set of parties that will settle directly on Ethereum. Some of these will be aggregating their clients’/citizens’ activities. While others will leverage Ethereum to eliminate their data liability. For example, Libra fell afoul of this. Had they deployed a rollup on Ethereum, instead of creating their own consensus mechanism, it might have worked out. (Of course, rollups did not exist then.)\n\nAnother way to look at this is:\n\n**Who will use Ethereum?** Financial institution, governments, corporations, whales. And of course, rollups, volitions and validiums settling on them, and sidechains / alt L1s bridging to it.\n\n**Who will use rollups?** Enthusiast users that prefer self-custodying and interacting directly with the rollup chains. (How people currently use Ethereum)\n\n**Who will use validiums and volitions?** Same as above, but perhaps more cost conscious and willing to trade security for lower costs.\n\nI expect most people to use smart wallets or centralized aggregators; and rarely interact with discrete frontends like we do now.\n\nI’m sure there’s an infographic that can be made from this!\n\n## Applications\n\nI don’t think we can imagine the type of applications will be built on rollups. It’s a wide-open design space, with applications that are simply impossible on traditional L1 blockchains. Non-consensus data availability will make significant strides, as will “Sign in with Ethereum” — both will be key. The floodgates will open to a new era of innovation, building innovative applications that’ll transform how people and societies function.\n\nThe lines between social networks, games, identity, governance and financial systems will increasingly start to get blurred. All of this will come together to make what many are now calling the metaverse, and most of it will be settled on Ethereum — even if users don’t realize it. They will be Greater Ethereum users, even if they never use Ethereum directly.\n\n## Ethereum — the base layer\n\nAt this point, Ethereum will have hundreds of data shards active. State expiry will be live, making the execution layer sustainable. Block builder / proposer separation is live, and the Beacon chain has single-slot finality. The Ethereum Foundation and the broader Ethereum research and client development community has one last remaining megaproject before Ethereum is ossified — zk-SNARK/STARK everything!\n\nWe might even see some experiments with non-EVM zkVMs, perhaps a dedicated zkVM shard built specifically for settling zero-knowledge proofs from rollups or other advanced cryptography, in parallel to the existing EVM. Eventually, the time will come to zk-SNARK/STARK the canonical EVM execution layer and the Beacon chain itself, and this is about when I expect to see the first proto-EIPs start emerging. It’ll be a daunting project, though, that’ll take several years to complete.\n\n— -\n\nThere’s a lot more I’m dreaming about, but I’ll stop here. Where do you think Ethereum will be in 2025?\n\nOriginally posted and discussion here: [A Vision of Ethereum (2025) : ethfinance (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pgcbar/a_vision_of_ethereum_2025/)", "timestamp": 1633453810, "digest": "iujAzlqzNFjyOk6j_rcxAFTarDfOR-iBTo84Wlcu21A", "contributor": "0x429F9aDA43e9F345CbB85EC88681BB70Df808892"}

I get to combine my love of writing science fiction and fantasy with my love of blockchain, crypto, and web3.\n\nWill I be the first author to publish writing on the blockchain? Who knows, but I’ll tell you this: I won’t be the last, or even close to the best.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mEladi0xRUOPeMn8u3BQP.jpg?height=500&width=333)\n\nI published Dybsy in 2017 and 4 years of development. (Actually, I wrote 80% of the book about 2 months, starting around December 2013, then floundered for a few years before mustering the energy to finish it).\n\nInspired, I began writing my second book, Remember the Dawn, in August 2017. True to form, I wrote 40% of the book in a month, then took another 10 months to finish.\n\nIn 2019, I produced both of books into audio. I don’t even like audiobooks, but they’re there on Audible to be heard.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZiWoV_l4CMlRtQU7T5Ll2.jpg?height=500&width=334)\n\nEver since, I’ve put words to page much like a toddler might thrash about a pool the first time he or she is thrown in by their attentive parent.\n\nThere are many resources for authors who struggle with block, or motivation, or the struggle of completion. I hate them all. Hate is strong. Let me rephrase: I haven’t read, watched, or otherwise paid attention to any of them. I’m aware of their existence, sure, and of their theses, but they don’t really do anything for me.\n\nInstead of spending my time digesting advice from people who want to tell me what to do, I’m going to try something else. I’m going to publish this… book… here on Mirror. I’m going to complete it. And it’s going to feel good.\n\nWhat is this book?\n\nI call it, “The Book of Chapters One”. My chapters one. That is, almost every first chapter of a new story I’ve written since I published my last book. (Including some writing I did prior to publishing my first book. You’ll probably see the difference in writing quality).\n\nWould an anthology of short stories be better received? Almost definitely. Too bad. No resolutions to story arcs for you.\n\nInstead, you will get cliffhangers, over and over, and you come to despise me for leaving your questions unanswered. The characters you loved, or the stories with which you connected—even after just a page or two—will be left hanging.\n\nTHIS IS A GOOD THING.\n\nIf I can draw out your emotion in a first chapter, it means I’m doing something right. And if I can draw out that emotion so much that you feel compelled to tell me about how I am an asshole and simply must keep writing a particular story, all the better.\n\nMaybe I will.", "timestamp": 1633453791, "digest": "bkRMRQaHOa7eLqyEo8LDxCeMQe_R5QzFl5HQPnhcjOA", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}

I understood the concept of \"the blockchain\" broadly, got the gist of how it worked, but didn't really understand what was driving excitement or investment in a particular coin.\n\nI got on the Metamask train about 6 months ago because I was curious about it and I wanted to trade currencies, and then when NFTs started popping up I played with them a little, but the gas fees made them seem like totally worthless and impractical toys.\n\nI also vaguely understood that you could \"build software on the blockchain\" and that people were doing this with dApps, but I struggled to understand what this might do for users aside from letting them trade these weird investment vehicles that only nerds cared about.\n\nWhat that whacked me upside the head about this was actually the NFT gaming space and BSC mainnet. On BSC, gas fees are on the order of 1-11 cents right now, which allowed me to play with the tech in a way that Ethereum was totally impractical for by the time I had Metamask.\n\nIf you haven't seen how this works, you have an addon in your browser (your \"wallet\") which contains crypto funds and you can one-click link it to a site you're visiting to interact with their services (of any kind, depending on what they've built).\n\nEven JUST looking at this, the ease and security of this, where you click to approve every transaction in Metamask, is already better than a credit card even if you're auto-filling it in with Chrome, which is more like a 4 click process with multiple keypresses.\n\nThis might not seem huge until you remember that streamlining a few clicks is a massive game changer. Amazon's one-click ordering was revolutionary when it launched because it massively reduced the friction of buying stuff.\n\nOkay so what do we actually have here? We have a piece of technology that ANY site can integrate with for financial transactions (txns), and those financial txns can be for fractions of a cent if that's appropriate for the use case.\n\nFurthermore, it operates using tokens (money) that are completely liquid, external to both parties, and basically universal because of the ease of exchanging them on DeFi (decentralized finance) exchanges for a fee significantly lower than a standard fiat exchange.\n\nI'm going to set the question of gas fees aside for a moment and will come back to that, but imagine that gas fees are near zero (fractions of a cent) for the purposes of this hypothetical, so it costs basically nothing to the user to approve a txn.\n\nWhy is this good and why should you care?\n\nIncentives, baby. Money makes the world go round. Every ad you see, every site you visit, every email client you access, and every platform you're on is making money from you somehow. It's how they provide the service to you.\n\nAnd often the value of that engagement is fractions of a cent. Ad purchases are often billed by either impressions or clicks and both have value depending on your goals (brand awareness or a purchase decision). But any individual impression is worth far less than one cent.\n\nSo often sites make ad revenue by offering a free service to users and then monetizing either exposure to eyeballs or selling information about those users to marketers who use it to move product. If the product is free, you're paying with your attention and your information.\n\nIf you could monetize your site engagement in an alternate way, you could free yourself from the hellish arms race of internet marketing by making it worth the platform's time to offer you a service without selling your information or making a costly purchase decision.\n\nSome sites take advantage of this now by explicitly charging you up front for services as their monetization model, but no one likes having a million $10 to 99-cent subscriptions on their credit card for apps they may or may not use much, and less isn't feasible for anyone.\n\nRemember that the actual value of the services you receive for an infrequently used app to either you or the provider of the service is somewhere BETWEEN $0.0001 and $0.99, but they can't really monetize you for less than a monthly charge of $0.99 unless they turn to ads.\n\nHistorically, ads have been the way to unlock the value of those fractional cents and they're what makes offering free services viable as a business model.\n\nYou can't charge an individual user $0.0001 cents every time they use your service, but you can charge an advertiser $100 for X impressions each of which are individually worth $0.0001 cents to that advertiser.\n\nEven if you use an aggressive ad blocker you're in an arms race, your demographic (or personal) info is still being resold, and you're still fighting a constant uphill battle against novel marketing techniques which are calculated to absorb your attention (and thus your time).\n\nThis is actually shockingly costly for you in ways you might not realize. If you value your personal time at even $20/hour, the 5 seconds you spent distracted by an ad or annoyed by an intrusive message cost you personally about $0.03, but you can't do much about it.\n\nAnd this doesn't even factor in the psychological toll of the onslaught of notifications and ads you're battling with every day, enabled by the platforms you use because *it's their business model*.\n\nIf you had some alternate means of compensating service providers for the actual value of engagement with their service at the same or better rate they get for selling 100 of your impressions to an advertiser, they have no need to do that.\n\nAds aren't my whole case here, by the way--this is just a very easy example to illustrate an area that this can enable.\n\nSo historically, even token-based compensation models where you buy X tokens for engagement are a terrible deal for users, which is why they don't work.\n\nYou need to deal with complicated mechanisms to store token balances and the overhead of getting users to make a token purchase decision and refill their balance and they can't cash out or move their tokens. Games use this model a lot.\n\nThe biggest barrier to adopting micro-payments like this are all of these annoying factors that prevent users from wanting to adopt any particular company's micropayment scheme (plus the company can just shred your tokens or change the contract when they feel like it).\n\nBut a universal wallet application that sites can seamlessly integrate with operated by a third party would solve all of these problems nicely. This hasn't been feasible before because the incentives to build and adopt such a system weren't there for anyone.\n\nPlus, how do you then trust THAT third party with your money and manage your balances there and ensure that they don't just monetize you too and cut backroom deals with the companies they support? It's never happened because it's a c\\*f for everyone.\n\nBut crypto wallets don't have this problem because they're decentralized and automated. The protocol and the network exists. The nodes are compensated by fees. Everything in the service is laid out in public and can be examined by anyone who wants to, and built by community.\n\nCompanies don't have to build anything special. They just have to integrate with the existing network. And they're incentivized to do that because there's a business opportunity (monetization models that are better for users).\n\nUsers benefit by retaining control of how they pay and what they pay for and being able to pay the ACTUAL value of the engagement in fractions of a cent, as well as keeping their money as liquid as cash, especially as more sites adopt the payment model.\n\nIt's actually even better than this--the psychological effect of numerous \"token spend\" decisions is distasteful, but with smart contracts you can establish conditions for automated spend that are publicly examinable, approve them, and not think about it anymore.\n\nThis means that with something like a Metamask integration (and near zero gas fees) you could one-click one-time approve something like Twitter to auto-bill you for usage at like 1 cent per month and never have to worry about ads creeping into your feed from the arms race.\n\nBut it gets even more interesting when you start thinking about mutually beneficial relationships. The value to Twitter of me writing a thread that gets a lot of engagement is not zero, due to platform attention. Other users benefit too from entertainment or new information.\n\nThe same contract could compensate me with fractions of a cent for every like or every bit of engagement I get equivalent to the actual value of that engagement for the service provider based on clearly established rules laid out in the smart contract.\n\nThis means that by just hanging out and making the space welcoming and inviting and having fun and positive interactions, the service could still be free for me to use or even net positive in a way that makes everyone happy and no one is annoyed by.\n\nThis would all be governed by a community-vetted smart contract with publicly examinable code and conditions that I opted into with a single click. Net positive better world than the current state of affairs. Everyone makes money. Everyone has more control over their attention and time.\n\nOkay so this is (maybe) cool, but so what right? This is all contingent on businesses actually building on this technology, everyone having something like MetaMask to use it, and gas fees for a txn being basically near-zero from my perspective, none of which is true... *yet*.\n\nAlso this is another obvious objection--no one wants to think about whether to spend $0.000001 every time they like a tweet. It feels scary and clunky.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image.png)\n\nLet's tackle each of these, starting with the last one.\n\nIn this model you don't *actually *have to make a purchase decision every time you like a tweet. The contract governs that and it could bill you in one txn every so often once intermediary software supports this, as just one example.\n\nWhen your monthly Twitter bill doesn't even register for you because it's on the order of $0.02 cents and it's totally opaque to you due to the smart contract and your one-click agreement, this FEELS the same as free.\n\nIt's just like ad monetization now: feels free, not free.\n\nYou never even see the bill (unless you want to) and you pay for exactly what you use, potentially offset by the value of utility you provide to the site community. If you're having fun and creating a lot of value for people, it actually MIGHT be free or net positive for you.\n\nNext up is the classic catch-22 of user adoption and network effects: No one wants to install MetaMask without a good reason (because it's complicated and scary) and no sites wanna build on tech no one uses no matter how cool it is or what new biz models it might enable.\n\nWell, guess what? Here's a fun metric:\n\n\"In July 2020 the platform saw 545,080 MAUs and by April 2021, Metamask had 3 million MAUs. Today, Metamask has 10,354,279 MAUs and has grown 1,800% since July 2020.\"\n\n[https://news.bitcoin.com/metamask-surpasses-10-million-monthly-active-users-climbing-1800-in-12-months/](https://t.co/kPWwyuimx1)\n\nWhat's driving this adoption is people starting to catch on to the vision, users actually playing with crypto in the ways it was envisioned to be used, and businesses starting to support this.\n\nJust kidding, it's largely speculation on being able to make $$$ on crypto.\n\nBut that's TOTALLY okay! In fact, that's great. The speculation >>> understanding the tech >>> buying into the vision pipeline is real and it's a GOOD thing.\n\nRemember how financial incentives make the world go round? People follow the money.\n\nThere's a TON of money to be made by bringing micro txns into services. Finance platforms front-ran this, but we're seeing it with games now too beginning in earnest this summer.\n\nAxie Infinity did $42 Million in sales in June 2021 alone. That's $500M in annual revenue.\n\nFor comparison, Marvel Strike Force has been one of the top grossing games in the app store forever and did $300M in revenue last year. It's a major brand backed by major players designed to monetize its player base.\n\nFinancials like this make everyone perk up.\n\nStop and think about that for a sec. You're an investor looking to grow your wealth. A random game comes out of nowhere and does almost 1/6th of one of the top grossing apps in the app store in revenue in its first month of operation.\n\nFinancial incentives drive interest.\n\nFurthermore, all of this interest and money flying around gets USERS more interested. People wanna know what this new hotness is. People see crypto price growth in this sector and wanna learn to play with it. People (hi its me) install MetaMask just to play around.\n\nThis creates a self-reinforcing cycle where there's more money in play, more tech is being adopted, and more businesses want to get in on a piece of this because time to market == $$$. Both businesses and users have incentives to get involved.\n\nAdoption in some specific sectors and some nerdy circles sparks interest and adoption in other sectors, as people with specialized industry knowledge start to grok the concept and realize that they can adapt it for use in THEIR domain too.\n\nAs this radiates out and more users begin to understand it conceptually, they can better explain it to their friends, who then have more confidence in trying it themselves. I explained how crypto tech actually works to my roommate last night and blew her mind.\n\nShe just bought into Solana for $1000 and *actually understands *what she's buying and why it might appreciate now. This is different from crypto investing a year ago for most retail investors.\n\nThis is better than aping in because it's an investment in the vision and an understanding of how this might actually translate to financial growth and gains which is closer to traditional investing (compared to my very dumb dabbling with dog coins for fun).\n\nSo this potential future vision is really cool, right? You can see how it's self-reinforcing and incentives are there for growth and how it's not just a ponzi scheme.\n\nOne big glaring problem with this nice utopian vision: scaling and gas fees.\n\nIf you, like me, have wanted to play in the NFT space and poked around with MetaMask because it's hot, you've probably been absolutely appalled by gas fees. It's like $100-$200+ dollars for ANY transaction on the ETH network right now.\n\nYou couldn't claim the totally free NFTs I posted the other day without spending over $100 for the privilege to own a collectible which didn't benefit me at all and might not appreciate ever.\n\nThis makes the crypto micro txns vision look absolutely insane to anyone with a brain because when most people can't cover a $500 emergency, no one is going to spend $100 to send a fraction of a cent to someone.\n\nBut tech, fortunately, isn't static. Last-gen crypto provided a concept template that we're already iterating on.\n\nYou might have heard about this little altcoin Solana that's grown 7000% since launching.\n\nDumb apes doing dumb ape shit amirite? 🙄\n\nBut actually maybe not. Why is Solana so cool?\n\nTo understand that, you have to understand why the gas fees on ETH are too damn high.\n\nThe way that crypto works (roughly) is that every node talks to every other node to agree on the transactions that occurred using a technology called Proof of Stake (and previously Proof of Work).\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp](https://t.co/IpFORGqTB2)\n\nRight now, the way that your transactions get processed on the blockchain involves bidding for your transaction to get included in the next processed block that validates transactions. This is what you're paying for when you pay gas fees.\n\nBut the processing power available for this AND the need for the nodes to all communicate and agree on the conditions of the txns are computationally expensive and create bottlenecks. Only so many slots can be processed as it scales. More use = higher bids to get a slot.\n\nEthereum is working on solving this problem by trying to move from a PoW to a PoS system, which is what ETH2 is all about.\n\nA PoS system dramatically improves the efficiency of the network to process txns.\n\n[https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/](https://t.co/fS4VKJ5dnB)\n\nRemember that reducing gas fees is what moves us closer to ACTUALLY usable micro txn tech at scale, because the cost of the txn has to be low enough to make txn worthwhile for both parties. You can't build a micro txn system when the cost of doing business is a mega txn.\n\nEven with Proof of Stake, we still have some significant processing power required for agreement between nodes at scale to sort out the txns, and it's unclear to what degree PoS will solve the current gas woes (in spite of big claims).\n\nIt might work really well! It might even get them down to where they need to be. Either way it's an improvement.\n\nBut enter Solana: Solana introduces a new model called PoH (proof of history) that they say in an improvement even over pure PoS.\n\n[https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-a-clock-for-blockchain-cf47a61a9274](https://t.co/Re1WKT23BB)\n\nWithout going too deep into the guts of how this works (go read the article if you wanna learn more), PoH says it can make txns even more efficient by reducing the computational aspect of timestamp agreement between nodes.\n\nThis is very exciting if it works out, because it means that we're potentially in reach of txn volume on the scale of Visa but with txn costs at many subfractions of $0.01.\n\nSuddenly the economics are feasible again. Solana is out today and already uses this model.\n\nThe businesses and users looking at these models like the tech, but need it to be financially viable. Solana (and ADA and ETH2) are the frontrunners right now that seem to be capable of making this model financially viable or at least moving us MUCH closer than we were.\n\nTxns at fractions of a cent at scale, widely used by a rapidly increasing number of users and businesses, open a whole world of possibilities for the design and implementation of smart contracts and actually make some of these micro-engagements I described earlier viable.\n\nThis is a big part of why Solana is shooting up right now. It's not just aping (although there's plenty of aping). It's that people looking toward future financial incentives, who \"get\" crypto, are looking for solutions that solve the core problems of the existing protocols.\n\nLaying a bet on Solana (or ADA or ETH2) is making a bet on the future success of this economic model given the factors I've described here whether you realize what you're doing or not.\n\nRight now you might think that crypto seems like a wasteful, useless toy for nerds.\n\nBut consider that this is also what computers looked like in 1980 to most people because they were staring at the present landscape and didn't fully grasp how it would evolve to be integrated with all levels of business as a \\_superior solution\\_.\n\n\"Why would I buy an IBM and pay a monthly fee to a telecom company for a janky and complicated 14.4 modem connection so that I can email my friend when I can just call her instead?\"\n\nGood point. But you're not appreciating a future state with this objection.\n\n\"Why would anyone have a website or hand their credit card information over to some faceless company you can't even see when they can run away with your payment info? The site is useless anyway.\"\n\nYes, true in 1998. Today it's not and seems silly to imagine.\n\nBusinesses and users who \\_do\\_ get the potential and move in early get to reap the benefits of being early movers in the space and will continue to grow it whether you think it's dumb or not, like the guy making fun of PCs in 1990.\n\nSo anyway, this is all why I'm crypto-pilled now. Some of it is just ponzi schemes and aping. But the underlying technology \\_isn't\\_ and is poised to rapidly explode and generate entirely new consumer-oriented business models as we work to solve these problems.\n\nLet's look at some of the original comments on this thread: Sai makes a great point about disclosing incentives. FWIW, I'm heavily invested in crypto and particularly in ETH2, ADA, and SOL, plus a bunch of speculative bets. Do your own research, don't just trust what I say.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-1.png)\n\nJessa makes a good point about the total value of crypto vs other total wealth allocation. This amount is WAY up over the last few years and seems likely to continue to grow. More self-reinforcement via financial incentives.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-2.png)\n\nRohit makes a good point about resistance from legacy incentives. This is all so new there are absolutely downstream issues and conflicts with existing systems and incentives that aren't immediately visible to everyone. As with any new tech (like the internet) we'll have to solve them for wider adoption.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-3.png)\n\nSai isn't wrong about it maybe being too early even for value-based investment in the underlying technology of coins that aren't just ponzi schemes. We haven't seen it really work yet. But we're on the precipice of that as a potential!\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-4.png)\n\nCharlie is correct that the tax situation is a nightmare right now. But we already have services like Koinly coming out to help ease the burden of tax calculation. This is a big enough problem that solutions will spring up quickly.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-5.png)\n\nA cool thing about blockchains is that solutions can easily be built to calculate your reporting requirements and tax burden if you enter all your wallet addresses.\n\nToday, Paypal eliminates the burden of 1099s for contractors paid through their platform.\n\nI expect that we'll see a LOT of innovation in this space as micro txns become more mainstream that will virtually eliminate this as a burden, and as businesses begin to make money they'll lobby to ease the tax reporting issues because it'll be an adoption barrier for them.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-6.png)\n\nIt's true that the signal to noise ratio is REALLY bad right now, which is why threads like this are important so that you understand the potential of what you're aping into and why some coins are better than others as long-term investment vehicles.\n\nGot more comments or questions?

The contract governs that and it could bill you in one txn every so often once intermediary software supports this, as just one example.\n\nWhen your monthly Twitter bill doesn't even register for you because it's on the order of $0.02 cents and it's totally opaque to you due to the smart contract and your one-click agreement, this FEELS the same as free.\n\nIt's just like ad monetization now: feels free, not free.\n\nYou never even see the bill (unless you want to) and you pay for exactly what you use, potentially offset by the value of utility you provide to the site community. If you're having fun and creating a lot of value for people, it actually MIGHT be free or net positive for you.\n\nNext up is the classic catch-22 of user adoption and network effects: No one wants to install MetaMask without a good reason (because it's complicated and scary) and no sites wanna build on tech no one uses no matter how cool it is or what new biz models it might enable.\n\nWell, guess what? Here's a fun metric:\n\n\"In July 2020 the platform saw 545,080 MAUs and by April 2021, Metamask had 3 million MAUs. Today, Metamask has 10,354,279 MAUs and has grown 1,800% since July 2020.\"\n\n[https://news.bitcoin.com/metamask-surpasses-10-million-monthly-active-users-climbing-1800-in-12-months/](https://t.co/kPWwyuimx1)\n\nWhat's driving this adoption is people starting to catch on to the vision, users actually playing with crypto in the ways it was envisioned to be used, and businesses starting to support this.\n\nJust kidding, it's largely speculation on being able to make $$$ on crypto.\n\nBut that's TOTALLY okay! In fact, that's great. The speculation >>> understanding the tech >>> buying into the vision pipeline is real and it's a GOOD thing.\n\nRemember how financial incentives make the world go round? People follow the money.\n\nThere's a TON of money to be made by bringing micro txns into services. Finance platforms front-ran this, but we're seeing it with games now too beginning in earnest this summer.\n\nAxie Infinity did $42 Million in sales in June 2021 alone. That's $500M in annual revenue.\n\nFor comparison, Marvel Strike Force has been one of the top grossing games in the app store forever and did $300M in revenue last year. It's a major brand backed by major players designed to monetize its player base.\n\nFinancials like this make everyone perk up.\n\nStop and think about that for a sec. You're an investor looking to grow your wealth. A random game comes out of nowhere and does almost 1/6th of one of the top grossing apps in the app store in revenue in its first month of operation.\n\nFinancial incentives drive interest.\n\nFurthermore, all of this interest and money flying around gets USERS more interested. People wanna know what this new hotness is. People see crypto price growth in this sector and wanna learn to play with it. People (hi its me) install MetaMask just to play around.\n\nThis creates a self-reinforcing cycle where there's more money in play, more tech is being adopted, and more businesses want to get in on a piece of this because time to market == $$$. Both businesses and users have incentives to get involved.\n\nAdoption in some specific sectors and some nerdy circles sparks interest and adoption in other sectors, as people with specialized industry knowledge start to grok the concept and realize that they can adapt it for use in THEIR domain too.\n\nAs this radiates out and more users begin to understand it conceptually, they can better explain it to their friends, who then have more confidence in trying it themselves. I explained how crypto tech actually works to my roommate last night and blew her mind.\n\nShe just bought into Solana for $1000 and *actually understands *what she's buying and why it might appreciate now. This is different from crypto investing a year ago for most retail investors.\n\nThis is better than aping in because it's an investment in the vision and an understanding of how this might actually translate to financial growth and gains which is closer to traditional investing (compared to my very dumb dabbling with dog coins for fun).\n\nSo this potential future vision is really cool, right? You can see how it's self-reinforcing and incentives are there for growth and how it's not just a ponzi scheme.\n\nOne big glaring problem with this nice utopian vision: scaling and gas fees.\n\nIf you, like me, have wanted to play in the NFT space and poked around with MetaMask because it's hot, you've probably been absolutely appalled by gas fees. It's like $100-$200+ dollars for ANY transaction on the ETH network right now.\n\nYou couldn't claim the totally free NFTs I posted the other day without spending over $100 for the privilege to own a collectible which didn't benefit me at all and might not appreciate ever.\n\nThis makes the crypto micro txns vision look absolutely insane to anyone with a brain because when most people can't cover a $500 emergency, no one is going to spend $100 to send a fraction of a cent to someone.\n\nBut tech, fortunately, isn't static. Last-gen crypto provided a concept template that we're already iterating on.\n\nYou might have heard about this little altcoin Solana that's grown 7000% since launching.\n\nDumb apes doing dumb ape shit amirite? 🙄\n\nBut actually maybe not. Why is Solana so cool?\n\nTo understand that, you have to understand why the gas fees on ETH are too damn high.\n\nThe way that crypto works (roughly) is that every node talks to every other node to agree on the transactions that occurred using a technology called Proof of Stake (and previously Proof of Work).\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp](https://t.co/IpFORGqTB2)\n\nRight now, the way that your transactions get processed on the blockchain involves bidding for your transaction to get included in the next processed block that validates transactions. This is what you're paying for when you pay gas fees.\n\nBut the processing power available for this AND the need for the nodes to all communicate and agree on the conditions of the txns are computationally expensive and create bottlenecks. Only so many slots can be processed as it scales. More use = higher bids to get a slot.\n\nEthereum is working on solving this problem by trying to move from a PoW to a PoS system, which is what ETH2 is all about.\n\nA PoS system dramatically improves the efficiency of the network to process txns.\n\n[https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/](https://t.co/fS4VKJ5dnB)\n\nRemember that reducing gas fees is what moves us closer to ACTUALLY usable micro txn tech at scale, because the cost of the txn has to be low enough to make txn worthwhile for both parties. You can't build a micro txn system when the cost of doing business is a mega txn.\n\nEven with Proof of Stake, we still have some significant processing power required for agreement between nodes at scale to sort out the txns, and it's unclear to what degree PoS will solve the current gas woes (in spite of big claims).\n\nIt might work really well! It might even get them down to where they need to be. Either way it's an improvement.\n\nBut enter Solana: Solana introduces a new model called PoH (proof of history) that they say in an improvement even over pure PoS.\n\n[https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-a-clock-for-blockchain-cf47a61a9274](https://t.co/Re1WKT23BB)\n\nWithout going too deep into the guts of how this works (go read the article if you wanna learn more), PoH says it can make txns even more efficient by reducing the computational aspect of timestamp agreement between nodes.\n\nThis is very exciting if it works out, because it means that we're potentially in reach of txn volume on the scale of Visa but with txn costs at many subfractions of $0.01.\n\nSuddenly the economics are feasible again. Solana is out today and already uses this model.\n\nThe businesses and users looking at these models like the tech, but need it to be financially viable. Solana (and ADA and ETH2) are the frontrunners right now that seem to be capable of making this model financially viable or at least moving us MUCH closer than we were.\n\nTxns at fractions of a cent at scale, widely used by a rapidly increasing number of users and businesses, open a whole world of possibilities for the design and implementation of smart contracts and actually make some of these micro-engagements I described earlier viable.\n\nThis is a big part of why Solana is shooting up right now. It's not just aping (although there's plenty of aping). It's that people looking toward future financial incentives, who \"get\" crypto, are looking for solutions that solve the core problems of the existing protocols.\n\nLaying a bet on Solana (or ADA or ETH2) is making a bet on the future success of this economic model given the factors I've described here whether you realize what you're doing or not.\n\nRight now you might think that crypto seems like a wasteful, useless toy for nerds.\n\nBut consider that this is also what computers looked like in 1980 to most people because they were staring at the present landscape and didn't fully grasp how it would evolve to be integrated with all levels of business as a \\_superior solution\\_.\n\n\"Why would I buy an IBM and pay a monthly fee to a telecom company for a janky and complicated 14.4 modem connection so that I can email my friend when I can just call her instead?\"\n\nGood point. But you're not appreciating a future state with this objection.\n\n\"Why would anyone have a website or hand their credit card information over to some faceless company you can't even see when they can run away with your payment info? The site is useless anyway.\"\n\nYes, true in 1998. Today it's not and seems silly to imagine.\n\nBusinesses and users who \\_do\\_ get the potential and move in early get to reap the benefits of being early movers in the space and will continue to grow it whether you think it's dumb or not, like the guy making fun of PCs in 1990.\n\nSo anyway, this is all why I'm crypto-pilled now. Some of it is just ponzi schemes and aping. But the underlying technology \\_isn't\\_ and is poised to rapidly explode and generate entirely new consumer-oriented business models as we work to solve these problems.\n\nLet's look at some of the original comments on this thread: Sai makes a great point about disclosing incentives. FWIW, I'm heavily invested in crypto and particularly in ETH2, ADA, and SOL, plus a bunch of speculative bets. Do your own research, don't just trust what I say.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-1.png)\n\nJessa makes a good point about the total value of crypto vs other total wealth allocation. This amount is WAY up over the last few years and seems likely to continue to grow. More self-reinforcement via financial incentives.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-2.png)\n\nRohit makes a good point about resistance from legacy incentives. This is all so new there are absolutely downstream issues and conflicts with existing systems and incentives that aren't immediately visible to everyone. As with any new tech (like the internet) we'll have to solve them for wider adoption.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-3.png)\n\nSai isn't wrong about it maybe being too early even for value-based investment in the underlying technology of coins that aren't just ponzi schemes. We haven't seen it really work yet. But we're on the precipice of that as a potential!\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-4.png)\n\nCharlie is correct that the tax situation is a nightmare right now. But we already have services like Koinly coming out to help ease the burden of tax calculation. This is a big enough problem that solutions will spring up quickly.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-5.png)\n\nA cool thing about blockchains is that solutions can easily be built to calculate your reporting requirements and tax burden if you enter all your wallet addresses.\n\nToday, Paypal eliminates the burden of 1099s for contractors paid through their platform.\n\nI expect that we'll see a LOT of innovation in this space as micro txns become more mainstream that will virtually eliminate this as a burden, and as businesses begin to make money they'll lobby to ease the tax reporting issues because it'll be an adoption barrier for them.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-6.png)\n\nIt's true that the signal to noise ratio is REALLY bad right now, which is why threads like this are important so that you understand the potential of what you're aping into and why some coins are better than others as long-term investment vehicles.\n\nGot more comments or questions?

{"id": "C44JDtYoSD0IqhXc2X-PyfXUQWb7_wC3p5eZwqEE8bc", "title": "How Crypto Will Actually Change the World", "body": "Let's talk about DeFi and crypto this morning and specifically how and why this could change the world.\n\nI don't think I had *really* grasped the potential power of crypto until the last few days even though I've been dabbling with it for years.\n\nSo what changed for me?\n\nWell, up until recently I viewed crypto as many people buying it as an investment vehicle do. I understood the concept of \"the blockchain\" broadly, got the gist of how it worked, but didn't really understand what was driving excitement or investment in a particular coin.\n\nI got on the Metamask train about 6 months ago because I was curious about it and I wanted to trade currencies, and then when NFTs started popping up I played with them a little, but the gas fees made them seem like totally worthless and impractical toys.\n\nI also vaguely understood that you could \"build software on the blockchain\" and that people were doing this with dApps, but I struggled to understand what this might do for users aside from letting them trade these weird investment vehicles that only nerds cared about.\n\nWhat that whacked me upside the head about this was actually the NFT gaming space and BSC mainnet. On BSC, gas fees are on the order of 1-11 cents right now, which allowed me to play with the tech in a way that Ethereum was totally impractical for by the time I had Metamask.\n\nIf you haven't seen how this works, you have an addon in your browser (your \"wallet\") which contains crypto funds and you can one-click link it to a site you're visiting to interact with their services (of any kind, depending on what they've built).\n\nEven JUST looking at this, the ease and security of this, where you click to approve every transaction in Metamask, is already better than a credit card even if you're auto-filling it in with Chrome, which is more like a 4 click process with multiple keypresses.\n\nThis might not seem huge until you remember that streamlining a few clicks is a massive game changer. Amazon's one-click ordering was revolutionary when it launched because it massively reduced the friction of buying stuff.\n\nOkay so what do we actually have here? We have a piece of technology that ANY site can integrate with for financial transactions (txns), and those financial txns can be for fractions of a cent if that's appropriate for the use case.\n\nFurthermore, it operates using tokens (money) that are completely liquid, external to both parties, and basically universal because of the ease of exchanging them on DeFi (decentralized finance) exchanges for a fee significantly lower than a standard fiat exchange.\n\nI'm going to set the question of gas fees aside for a moment and will come back to that, but imagine that gas fees are near zero (fractions of a cent) for the purposes of this hypothetical, so it costs basically nothing to the user to approve a txn.\n\nWhy is this good and why should you care?\n\nIncentives, baby. Money makes the world go round. Every ad you see, every site you visit, every email client you access, and every platform you're on is making money from you somehow. It's how they provide the service to you.\n\nAnd often the value of that engagement is fractions of a cent. Ad purchases are often billed by either impressions or clicks and both have value depending on your goals (brand awareness or a purchase decision). But any individual impression is worth far less than one cent.\n\nSo often sites make ad revenue by offering a free service to users and then monetizing either exposure to eyeballs or selling information about those users to marketers who use it to move product. If the product is free, you're paying with your attention and your information.\n\nIf you could monetize your site engagement in an alternate way, you could free yourself from the hellish arms race of internet marketing by making it worth the platform's time to offer you a service without selling your information or making a costly purchase decision.\n\nSome sites take advantage of this now by explicitly charging you up front for services as their monetization model, but no one likes having a million $10 to 99-cent subscriptions on their credit card for apps they may or may not use much, and less isn't feasible for anyone.\n\nRemember that the actual value of the services you receive for an infrequently used app to either you or the provider of the service is somewhere BETWEEN $0.0001 and $0.99, but they can't really monetize you for less than a monthly charge of $0.99 unless they turn to ads.\n\nHistorically, ads have been the way to unlock the value of those fractional cents and they're what makes offering free services viable as a business model.\n\nYou can't charge an individual user $0.0001 cents every time they use your service, but you can charge an advertiser $100 for X impressions each of which are individually worth $0.0001 cents to that advertiser.\n\nEven if you use an aggressive ad blocker you're in an arms race, your demographic (or personal) info is still being resold, and you're still fighting a constant uphill battle against novel marketing techniques which are calculated to absorb your attention (and thus your time).\n\nThis is actually shockingly costly for you in ways you might not realize. If you value your personal time at even $20/hour, the 5 seconds you spent distracted by an ad or annoyed by an intrusive message cost you personally about $0.03, but you can't do much about it.\n\nAnd this doesn't even factor in the psychological toll of the onslaught of notifications and ads you're battling with every day, enabled by the platforms you use because *it's their business model*.\n\nIf you had some alternate means of compensating service providers for the actual value of engagement with their service at the same or better rate they get for selling 100 of your impressions to an advertiser, they have no need to do that.\n\nAds aren't my whole case here, by the way--this is just a very easy example to illustrate an area that this can enable.\n\nSo historically, even token-based compensation models where you buy X tokens for engagement are a terrible deal for users, which is why they don't work.\n\nYou need to deal with complicated mechanisms to store token balances and the overhead of getting users to make a token purchase decision and refill their balance and they can't cash out or move their tokens. Games use this model a lot.\n\nThe biggest barrier to adopting micro-payments like this are all of these annoying factors that prevent users from wanting to adopt any particular company's micropayment scheme (plus the company can just shred your tokens or change the contract when they feel like it).\n\nBut a universal wallet application that sites can seamlessly integrate with operated by a third party would solve all of these problems nicely. This hasn't been feasible before because the incentives to build and adopt such a system weren't there for anyone.\n\nPlus, how do you then trust THAT third party with your money and manage your balances there and ensure that they don't just monetize you too and cut backroom deals with the companies they support? It's never happened because it's a c\\*f for everyone.\n\nBut crypto wallets don't have this problem because they're decentralized and automated. The protocol and the network exists. The nodes are compensated by fees. Everything in the service is laid out in public and can be examined by anyone who wants to, and built by community.\n\nCompanies don't have to build anything special. They just have to integrate with the existing network. And they're incentivized to do that because there's a business opportunity (monetization models that are better for users).\n\nUsers benefit by retaining control of how they pay and what they pay for and being able to pay the ACTUAL value of the engagement in fractions of a cent, as well as keeping their money as liquid as cash, especially as more sites adopt the payment model.\n\nIt's actually even better than this--the psychological effect of numerous \"token spend\" decisions is distasteful, but with smart contracts you can establish conditions for automated spend that are publicly examinable, approve them, and not think about it anymore.\n\nThis means that with something like a Metamask integration (and near zero gas fees) you could one-click one-time approve something like Twitter to auto-bill you for usage at like 1 cent per month and never have to worry about ads creeping into your feed from the arms race.\n\nBut it gets even more interesting when you start thinking about mutually beneficial relationships. The value to Twitter of me writing a thread that gets a lot of engagement is not zero, due to platform attention. Other users benefit too from entertainment or new information.\n\nThe same contract could compensate me with fractions of a cent for every like or every bit of engagement I get equivalent to the actual value of that engagement for the service provider based on clearly established rules laid out in the smart contract.\n\nThis means that by just hanging out and making the space welcoming and inviting and having fun and positive interactions, the service could still be free for me to use or even net positive in a way that makes everyone happy and no one is annoyed by.\n\nThis would all be governed by a community-vetted smart contract with publicly examinable code and conditions that I opted into with a single click. Net positive better world than the current state of affairs. Everyone makes money. Everyone has more control over their attention and time.\n\nOkay so this is (maybe) cool, but so what right? This is all contingent on businesses actually building on this technology, everyone having something like MetaMask to use it, and gas fees for a txn being basically near-zero from my perspective, none of which is true... *yet*.\n\nAlso this is another obvious objection--no one wants to think about whether to spend $0.000001 every time they like a tweet. It feels scary and clunky.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image.png)\n\nLet's tackle each of these, starting with the last one.\n\nIn this model you don't *actually *have to make a purchase decision every time you like a tweet. The contract governs that and it could bill you in one txn every so often once intermediary software supports this, as just one example.\n\nWhen your monthly Twitter bill doesn't even register for you because it's on the order of $0.02 cents and it's totally opaque to you due to the smart contract and your one-click agreement, this FEELS the same as free.\n\nIt's just like ad monetization now: feels free, not free.\n\nYou never even see the bill (unless you want to) and you pay for exactly what you use, potentially offset by the value of utility you provide to the site community. If you're having fun and creating a lot of value for people, it actually MIGHT be free or net positive for you.\n\nNext up is the classic catch-22 of user adoption and network effects: No one wants to install MetaMask without a good reason (because it's complicated and scary) and no sites wanna build on tech no one uses no matter how cool it is or what new biz models it might enable.\n\nWell, guess what? Here's a fun metric:\n\n\"In July 2020 the platform saw 545,080 MAUs and by April 2021, Metamask had 3 million MAUs. Today, Metamask has 10,354,279 MAUs and has grown 1,800% since July 2020.\"\n\n[https://news.bitcoin.com/metamask-surpasses-10-million-monthly-active-users-climbing-1800-in-12-months/](https://t.co/kPWwyuimx1)\n\nWhat's driving this adoption is people starting to catch on to the vision, users actually playing with crypto in the ways it was envisioned to be used, and businesses starting to support this.\n\nJust kidding, it's largely speculation on being able to make $$$ on crypto.\n\nBut that's TOTALLY okay! In fact, that's great. The speculation >>> understanding the tech >>> buying into the vision pipeline is real and it's a GOOD thing.\n\nRemember how financial incentives make the world go round? People follow the money.\n\nThere's a TON of money to be made by bringing micro txns into services. Finance platforms front-ran this, but we're seeing it with games now too beginning in earnest this summer.\n\nAxie Infinity did $42 Million in sales in June 2021 alone. That's $500M in annual revenue.\n\nFor comparison, Marvel Strike Force has been one of the top grossing games in the app store forever and did $300M in revenue last year. It's a major brand backed by major players designed to monetize its player base.\n\nFinancials like this make everyone perk up.\n\nStop and think about that for a sec. You're an investor looking to grow your wealth. A random game comes out of nowhere and does almost 1/6th of one of the top grossing apps in the app store in revenue in its first month of operation.\n\nFinancial incentives drive interest.\n\nFurthermore, all of this interest and money flying around gets USERS more interested. People wanna know what this new hotness is. People see crypto price growth in this sector and wanna learn to play with it. People (hi its me) install MetaMask just to play around.\n\nThis creates a self-reinforcing cycle where there's more money in play, more tech is being adopted, and more businesses want to get in on a piece of this because time to market == $$$. Both businesses and users have incentives to get involved.\n\nAdoption in some specific sectors and some nerdy circles sparks interest and adoption in other sectors, as people with specialized industry knowledge start to grok the concept and realize that they can adapt it for use in THEIR domain too.\n\nAs this radiates out and more users begin to understand it conceptually, they can better explain it to their friends, who then have more confidence in trying it themselves. I explained how crypto tech actually works to my roommate last night and blew her mind.\n\nShe just bought into Solana for $1000 and *actually understands *what she's buying and why it might appreciate now. This is different from crypto investing a year ago for most retail investors.\n\nThis is better than aping in because it's an investment in the vision and an understanding of how this might actually translate to financial growth and gains which is closer to traditional investing (compared to my very dumb dabbling with dog coins for fun).\n\nSo this potential future vision is really cool, right? You can see how it's self-reinforcing and incentives are there for growth and how it's not just a ponzi scheme.\n\nOne big glaring problem with this nice utopian vision: scaling and gas fees.\n\nIf you, like me, have wanted to play in the NFT space and poked around with MetaMask because it's hot, you've probably been absolutely appalled by gas fees. It's like $100-$200+ dollars for ANY transaction on the ETH network right now.\n\nYou couldn't claim the totally free NFTs I posted the other day without spending over $100 for the privilege to own a collectible which didn't benefit me at all and might not appreciate ever.\n\nThis makes the crypto micro txns vision look absolutely insane to anyone with a brain because when most people can't cover a $500 emergency, no one is going to spend $100 to send a fraction of a cent to someone.\n\nBut tech, fortunately, isn't static. Last-gen crypto provided a concept template that we're already iterating on.\n\nYou might have heard about this little altcoin Solana that's grown 7000% since launching.\n\nDumb apes doing dumb ape shit amirite? 🙄\n\nBut actually maybe not. Why is Solana so cool?\n\nTo understand that, you have to understand why the gas fees on ETH are too damn high.\n\nThe way that crypto works (roughly) is that every node talks to every other node to agree on the transactions that occurred using a technology called Proof of Stake (and previously Proof of Work).\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp](https://t.co/IpFORGqTB2)\n\nRight now, the way that your transactions get processed on the blockchain involves bidding for your transaction to get included in the next processed block that validates transactions. This is what you're paying for when you pay gas fees.\n\nBut the processing power available for this AND the need for the nodes to all communicate and agree on the conditions of the txns are computationally expensive and create bottlenecks. Only so many slots can be processed as it scales. More use = higher bids to get a slot.\n\nEthereum is working on solving this problem by trying to move from a PoW to a PoS system, which is what ETH2 is all about.\n\nA PoS system dramatically improves the efficiency of the network to process txns.\n\n[https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/](https://t.co/fS4VKJ5dnB)\n\nRemember that reducing gas fees is what moves us closer to ACTUALLY usable micro txn tech at scale, because the cost of the txn has to be low enough to make txn worthwhile for both parties. You can't build a micro txn system when the cost of doing business is a mega txn.\n\nEven with Proof of Stake, we still have some significant processing power required for agreement between nodes at scale to sort out the txns, and it's unclear to what degree PoS will solve the current gas woes (in spite of big claims).\n\nIt might work really well! It might even get them down to where they need to be. Either way it's an improvement.\n\nBut enter Solana: Solana introduces a new model called PoH (proof of history) that they say in an improvement even over pure PoS.\n\n[https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-a-clock-for-blockchain-cf47a61a9274](https://t.co/Re1WKT23BB)\n\nWithout going too deep into the guts of how this works (go read the article if you wanna learn more), PoH says it can make txns even more efficient by reducing the computational aspect of timestamp agreement between nodes.\n\nThis is very exciting if it works out, because it means that we're potentially in reach of txn volume on the scale of Visa but with txn costs at many subfractions of $0.01.\n\nSuddenly the economics are feasible again. Solana is out today and already uses this model.\n\nThe businesses and users looking at these models like the tech, but need it to be financially viable. Solana (and ADA and ETH2) are the frontrunners right now that seem to be capable of making this model financially viable or at least moving us MUCH closer than we were.\n\nTxns at fractions of a cent at scale, widely used by a rapidly increasing number of users and businesses, open a whole world of possibilities for the design and implementation of smart contracts and actually make some of these micro-engagements I described earlier viable.\n\nThis is a big part of why Solana is shooting up right now. It's not just aping (although there's plenty of aping). It's that people looking toward future financial incentives, who \"get\" crypto, are looking for solutions that solve the core problems of the existing protocols.\n\nLaying a bet on Solana (or ADA or ETH2) is making a bet on the future success of this economic model given the factors I've described here whether you realize what you're doing or not.\n\nRight now you might think that crypto seems like a wasteful, useless toy for nerds.\n\nBut consider that this is also what computers looked like in 1980 to most people because they were staring at the present landscape and didn't fully grasp how it would evolve to be integrated with all levels of business as a \\_superior solution\\_.\n\n\"Why would I buy an IBM and pay a monthly fee to a telecom company for a janky and complicated 14.4 modem connection so that I can email my friend when I can just call her instead?\"\n\nGood point. But you're not appreciating a future state with this objection.\n\n\"Why would anyone have a website or hand their credit card information over to some faceless company you can't even see when they can run away with your payment info? The site is useless anyway.\"\n\nYes, true in 1998. Today it's not and seems silly to imagine.\n\nBusinesses and users who \\_do\\_ get the potential and move in early get to reap the benefits of being early movers in the space and will continue to grow it whether you think it's dumb or not, like the guy making fun of PCs in 1990.\n\nSo anyway, this is all why I'm crypto-pilled now. Some of it is just ponzi schemes and aping. But the underlying technology \\_isn't\\_ and is poised to rapidly explode and generate entirely new consumer-oriented business models as we work to solve these problems.\n\nLet's look at some of the original comments on this thread: Sai makes a great point about disclosing incentives. FWIW, I'm heavily invested in crypto and particularly in ETH2, ADA, and SOL, plus a bunch of speculative bets. Do your own research, don't just trust what I say.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-1.png)\n\nJessa makes a good point about the total value of crypto vs other total wealth allocation. This amount is WAY up over the last few years and seems likely to continue to grow. More self-reinforcement via financial incentives.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-2.png)\n\nRohit makes a good point about resistance from legacy incentives. This is all so new there are absolutely downstream issues and conflicts with existing systems and incentives that aren't immediately visible to everyone. As with any new tech (like the internet) we'll have to solve them for wider adoption.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-3.png)\n\nSai isn't wrong about it maybe being too early even for value-based investment in the underlying technology of coins that aren't just ponzi schemes. We haven't seen it really work yet. But we're on the precipice of that as a potential!\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-4.png)\n\nCharlie is correct that the tax situation is a nightmare right now. But we already have services like Koinly coming out to help ease the burden of tax calculation. This is a big enough problem that solutions will spring up quickly.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-5.png)\n\nA cool thing about blockchains is that solutions can easily be built to calculate your reporting requirements and tax burden if you enter all your wallet addresses.\n\nToday, Paypal eliminates the burden of 1099s for contractors paid through their platform.\n\nI expect that we'll see a LOT of innovation in this space as micro txns become more mainstream that will virtually eliminate this as a burden, and as businesses begin to make money they'll lobby to ease the tax reporting issues because it'll be an adoption barrier for them.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-6.png)\n\nIt's true that the signal to noise ratio is REALLY bad right now, which is why threads like this are important so that you understand the potential of what you're aping into and why some coins are better than others as long-term investment vehicles.\n\nGot more comments or questions?

{"id": "eWXqk2nWuoznL2-ijZ5PWgxuGHSzUw9Abb9Smyab1ys", "title": "DeFi 101: All About Crypto", "body": "Let's talk about crypto tonight. The last three months have been a crash course for me as I've increasingly experimented in the DeFi space. I thought it might be useful to do a short primer on some of the many confusing concepts that baffled me on first contact here.\n\nI want to give a high-level overview on some of the weirder terms and concepts you'll see get thrown around: pools, farms, NFTs, staking, liquid defi, and margin trading.\n\nIt's not as complicated as it looks at first. The UX in this space is really bad. I'll also touch briefly on DAOs and what I'm seeing there, beyond [what I already discussed here](https://twitter.com/liminal_warmth/status/1441180281591844865).\n\nOne of the interesting things about this space is it's so incredibly new. Extremely veteran experts have a few years of experience at most. You can become an expert fast just by jumping in and playing around. Blue sky, green field, tons of opportunity. Very very early days.\n\nI'm going to assume that you have a basic understanding of what crypto is here. If you don't, the story is that a bunch of computers mutually agree on number balances in a ledger. You can write code to create circumstances under which these balances change (\"smart contracts\").\n\nYou can interact with established versions of these smart contracts on websites by \"connecting your wallet\" to them, which basically opts you in to their smart contract that allows exchanges to happen (which you consent to).\n\nUsually this is done by connecting a browser-based wallet (MetaMask, SolFlare, etc) to the site in question by clicking a button and approving it. Then you're allowed to take actions to interact with that site using the coins you've sent to that wallet address.\n\nSo you have a wallet in your browser, you sent some coins to it (from Coinbase or wherever), and you're ready to jump into DeFi. What can you do, and why would you do it?\n\nThe most basic use case is simple swaps: trading one currency for another currency on sites like Uniswap.\n\nThere are tons of these around, and you can only trade on the protocols that support the wallet and currency you want to use. Solana and Ethereum and Binance all operate on different protocols, and you can't directly trade coins across them.\n\nThere are mechanisms called \"bridge protocols\" from established providers that can be used to swap currency across chains, and they basically work by taking your currency on one chain and sending it to a wallet address on a different chain that you specify.\n\nSome wallets like MetaMask support multiple chains and you can operate across multiple networks by switching your network on the dropdown at the top. You still need to use a bridge to swap your coins over though.\n\nBy using these decentralized finance portals, or **DeFi** sites, you can quickly and directly trade coins on your own without going through a third party service like coinbase, which is \"custodial.\" They hold coins on your behalf, which means you really need to trust them.\n\n**Custodial services** can be great for security, but you run the risk of them disappearing with your coins (Mt. Gox anyone?) and you can't do anything if they have technical issues (I spent a week not being able to send SOL I bought on Coinbase due to tech issues).\n\nThe flipside of this is that your personal (MetaMask/Solflare/etc) wallet is only as secure as your personal risk management is. Do your research, consider using a cold wallet, and don't put all your doge in one wallet.\n\nThis feels scary at first but you get over it fast.\n\nSo Uniswap and Pancakeswap have been two of the historically most popular sites for DeFi, on the ETH and Binance chains respectively, and I'm going to use them to explain the next few DeFi concepts.\n\nEvery time you swap coins on these sites, they take a small fee.\n\nUsually when you're trading in a market, the market matches people who want to sell at the current price with people who want to buy at the current price.\n\nBut what if there isn't someone who wants to trade with your coins at the current market clearing price on this site?\n\nThis is where pools and farms come in. **Pools** are liquidity pools, which is a defi innovation where people put up an equally valued amount of Coin A and Coin B in a locked pairing in order to facilitate trades between those coins.\n\nThis means that you don't actually have to be matched with another human who wants to sell in order to make an exchange between those coins. The pool itself facilitates the exchange by always having both types of currency in the pool.\n\nSo a USDC-ETH pool, for example, would have 1 ETH for every 3000 USDC in it right now because 1 ETH is roughly equivalent to that dollar amount. The pool is constantly rebalanced to keep this mostly even.\n\nBecause these pools are supplied by the coins of individuals who voluntarily put them up by locking them into the pool's contract, you need people to want to do this.\n\nThe incentive is you get a variable amount of the fees from the swaps made by this pool by contributing.\n\nTo represent your ownership of the coins you have locked in the pool, you receive a fixed number of coins back from your position in the pool that are usually represented by a pairing of the pools coins. Put in 3000 USDC and 1 ETH, and get back 3001 USDC-ETH tokens.\n\nThese live in your wallet until you decide you want to exit the pool, at which point you go back and trade them in to receive the same number of tokens back that you put in. However, the pool is always being rebalanced to maintain the relative value of the pool's coins.\n\nSo if there are large price movements in the RELATIVE value of the two coins you have paired (in either direction), you may lose money if you cash out at that point. This is called **Impermanent Loss** and you should read about it if you want to play in this space.\n\nYou can either hold these liquidity pool tokens to collect the fees you've earned when you eventually redeem them or in some cases place the tokens into a \"farm\" offered by a provider for an additional rate of return. A farm is a separate smart contract from the pool.\n\n**Farms** expose you to additional risk by allowing someone to take your liquidity position and use it for whatever DeFi activities they'd like (lending your position) in exchange for this additional APR that varies by the amount of capital in the farm.\n\nWhen you remove your tokens from the farm, you should always get the same number of liquidity tokens that you put in (3001 USDC-ETH is still 3001 USDC-ETH), but you need to trust the provider you're handing your coins to. Most major exchanges are as safe as anything here.\n\nIn theory, these compounded gains (in general) should offset any impermanent loss you incur unless you paired a very unstable coin in a relatively stable coin for the liquidity pool. You'll see very high return rates on stablecoin pools and farms (USDC-any for example).\n\nThis is necessary because you should EXPECT movement of most assets in either direction from stablecoins given the historical volatility of crypto markets. Coins that move tightly together or are more stable offer lower rates (less risk).\n\nSo when you're pairing coins for liquidity that don't move tightly together (like ETH and a random dog coin) you need to factor in your risk due to impermanent loss from the price movement and your willingness to ride that movement out (or risk it never recovering).\n\nFarms usually reward you with tokens issued by the managing site which represent your portion of the rewards and which rise in value as those sites earn more from in fees from exchanges on their protocol (so PancakeSwap awards \"CAKE\" and Uniswap awards \"UNI\").\n\nAll of this is just 2 layers of lending levels designed to offer you a return on your position, and you need to compare the total expected APR against the likelihood of any particular coin raising or lowering in value (just hodling your coins).\n\nYou also need to compare this against **Staking **your coins, which is a lending alternative to all this liquidity and farming stuff by doing a direct lend of your coins to a smart contract in exchange for a fixed APR, usually used by a validator node to facilitate the network.\n\nUnlike these other options, \"staking\" your coins often involves a lock-up period where you can't pull your coins back out until the end of the lock up period. The returns you earn come from the rewards of validating blocks instead of enabling coin swaps.\n\nYour coins are fairly safe if you stake with a reputable validator, and you still technically own them in most cases via a smart contract claim (though they're not in your wallet). The rates for this tend to be lower than liquidity farming, because the risks are lower.\n\nAll of these are lending instruments that allow you to earn additional gains on your coins over holding and you back out of your position by going to the site with the contract and exiting your position once the lock-up period is over. Some wallets also offer direct staking.\n\nIncreasingly, staking providers are now offering you tokens in exchange for your stake which offers you a way to access the coins that are locked up in the stake by giving you a tradeable token representing your \"stake\" with that contract.\n\nYou can send, sell, or trade these tokens like any other currency, and anyone holding the token can redeem it from the provider for that tokens share of the stake pool. These tokens increase in value based on the validator fees collected by the stake pool.\n\n**Liquid staking** is a newer concept used by some protocols like Solana where you can sidestep the staking lock-up period entirely by offering your coins to a provider who spreads them across validators and operates kind of like a staking exchange. Marinade is one example.\n\nYou want lots of network validators active on the chain for complex technical reasons related to network health, and liquid staking allows someone else to manage that while issuing one central token to you that increases in value while you hold it.\n\nAnyone can put their SOL up on Marinade (and sites like it) and let Marinade manage the network health while taking their promissory tokens and going to go do other DeFi stuff with them (like the aforementioned liquidity farming).\n\nThis gets very tricky when you do stuff like this because you're now operating through THREE levels of lending if you dump your liquid staking tokens in a liquidity pool and then farm them. Kinda gotta do some complex financial wizardry to figure out if it's worth it.\n\nThis is also where things start to get kinda wild wild west and fun, though. Basically all of these things are risk and return management tools. You can take on as much risk as you're comfortable with for ever-increasing returns (and oh boy can it get risky).\n\nBecause now we get into **lending** and **margin trading**. There's yet another thing you can do with your coins (or any of the secondary tokens from any of these positions): You can put them up as collateral for margin trading on sites like Solend.\n\nBecause all of these tokens have immediate market value and uses in lending and borrowing via the markets and instruments we've already discussed, sites like Solend will let you lend these coins and instruments to other people who want to borrow them for fixed rates.\n\nNote that this differs from the previous scenarios in that your coins (when lending) are relatively safe through a lending broker because they often have automated liquidation of borrowed positions that get out of balance to ensure they can return your coins when you want.\n\nThis is more like peer to peer lending via a brokered pool of currency, and the rates for lending tend to increase as more of a particular currency in demand. There are still risks here, and you should read about them. But it's more like staking with no lock-up.\n\nMany of these sites allow you to use your lent currency as collateral to borrow other kinds of currency, up to 80% of the coins you have put up as collateral. So if you have 1 ETH staked in their pool, you can borrow up to .8 ETH of value in any currency you like.\n\nWhy would you do this? Well one reason might be if you have a short term need for currency but don't want to realize gains on a coin you hold. Putting it up as collateral (at this time) does not trigger a taxable event.\n\nSo you can borrow against ETH that you hold, which locks it in the smart contract, and borrow USDC that you can use for whatever you like without triggering a taxable event on your underlying ETH (no gain for using borrowed funds). You do have to repay the loan.\n\nAgain, this is the wild wild west, so this might change at any time with new guidance, but right now this works the same as putting up your house for a bank loan (which you know as a mortgage). You get taxed when you sell your house, not on the money you borrowed against it.\n\nAnd this also unlocks new kinds of uses for tokens that couldn't otherwise be easily converted for trading or lending.\n\nSome sites, like Parrot Protocol, will take your liquidity tokens (which you'd normally farm) and allow you to mint tradeable stablecoins from them.\n\nIf you're dizzy at this point, I'm not surprised. This is a lot and it's hard to wrap your head around until you actually see it in action.\n\nRemember that this is just layers upon layers of lending activity. Each step is increasing your risk for a return you need to calculate\n\nThe bottom line is that if you want to margin yourself to the hilt for 3000% annual returns that you have to watch on a hair trigger for flash crashes, you can do this. Stare at charts to your heart's content with your finger over the \"withdraw\" button.\n\nIf that's not your jam, take your ETH and lock it into a stake pool on Coinbase for 5% annual returns until they let go of it.\n\nThere's a risk level and playground to suit anyone looking for a particular use case or return on their coins.\n\nWhat's interesting is that these are tools and strategies that aren't normally available to the average Joe and most people have no idea WTF we're doing here for both complexity and novel tech reasons. But people in finance have done this stuff forever.\n\nPlay at your own risk!\n\nBut even the most paltry and risk averse staking play is offering returns comparable to or better than the \"historical average\" 7% safety situation of the stock market index, and potentially many multiples of that if you increase your risk a bit.\n\nYes, you're taking on underlying risk by even leaving money in the crypto market anyway (which is what people will be quick to point out), and also if you're playing around with ETH or newer coins like SOL or FTM or BNB, which are more volatile.\n\nBut if you're long and hodling on those coins anyway, all of these instruments are ways to let your coins work for you via investment tools instead of just having them sit in a cold wallet somewhere, and it's worth looking at if you want to maximize returns.\n\nFinally, I want to take one sec to explain **NFTs **and **DAOs **a little bit. I plan to do an entirely separate thread on NFTs at some point, because I want to follow up my last thread on them this spring, which was much more bearish because I didn't understand them as well.\n\nThe NFT market is ablaze with hype at the moment, and if you wanna trade while the trading is good, by all means play there (I am, badly, and still learning the market). But the real value of NFTs is not just ponzi trading on jpegs even if it looks like that right now.\n\n**NFTs **are exactly what they're labeled on the tin: they're uniquely identifiable tokens which can have their ownership validated on the block chain. There actually are a myriad of uses for them, and ecosystems are already springing up around them.\n\nI touched on this a little bit [in this thread](https://twitter.com/EnzikaOfAsh/status/1442627854894723077), and I want to follow up on the potential future use cases in a separate thread later, as I said. But for now, just trust that there IS real utility beyond the excited hype of the moment.\n\nAs for **DAOs**, this is probably the least-well understood concept in crypto right now because it's one of the newest. DAO stands for **Decentralized Autonomous Organization**. It's an extremely flexible way to pool resources and organize with other individuals on the blockchain.\n\nDAOs are governed by smart contracts whose rules are specific to the DAO, but usually has a coin/resource pool and a voting mechanism that allows members of the DAO to decide how to allocate those resources in the service of a shared mission.\n\nThis can be anything from a small art project to a fully resourced organization attempting a digital replacement for an incorporated co-op (or even potentially a virtual, decentralized nation). I unpacked the co-op vision a bit [in this thread](https://twitter.com/liminal_warmth/status/1441180281591844865).\n\nThe most interesting aspect of DAOs is that they're a way to pool funds for shared goals in a way that doesn't actually require knowing one another or even having trust. The contract is published. The votes are visible. You can check the smart contract code.\n\nIt remains to be seen how useful this ends up being or how they'll evolve in coming years, but they're so very new and this space is so fresh and fast moving that I'm SURE I'm missing things about them just like I did before I wrapped my head around every other part of crypto.\n\nI'm sure I'll write about these more in coming months too as I become more familiar with the space and novel and interesting use cases present themselves. But there's a LOT of cool energy here and it's one of the most cutting edge tech spaces you can operate in.\n\nWhen you combine NFTs, ICOs, and DAOs, spinning up and funding a new project with people from all over the world has never been faster or easier than it is at this moment. It's moving so fast that legislation can barely track it right now (let alone keep up).\n\nIt's fascinating to watch. It feels like the very early days of the internet when it was first catching pop culture's imagination. Anything could happen, and we're just getting started.\n\nMoney makes the world go round and this space is rolling in it.\n\nIf you're a young, tech-savvy person looking to make their mark on the tech scene, here's my advice: if you're not learning everything you can about AI/ML, you should be participating in a DAO and working on a Web3 application.\n\nYesterday's Jobs, Gates, Zuckerberg, and Bezos were building on the back of Web 1.0 and Web 2.0.\n\nTomorrow's version of those guys is working on Web 3.0 right now.\n\nPay attention.\n", "timestamp": 1633453984, "digest": "y-cCg-jiR9naiPy3OKN3epO8dTsmtFefEq3i1o4EGxs", "contributor": "0x0150C68d9d87F10446EeC313D732397B5DB09280"}

{"id": "N2FN6ehj6kYTLtdnGQEPQda785OHhxY0SK3IJ01VBy4", "title": "How Crypto Will Actually Change the World", "body": "Let's talk about DeFi and crypto this morning and specifically how and why this could change the world.\n\nI don't think I had *really* grasped the potential power of crypto until the last few days even though I've been dabbling with it for years.\n\nSo what changed for me?\n\nWell, up until recently I viewed crypto as many people buying it as an investment vehicle do. I understood the concept of \"the blockchain\" broadly, got the gist of how it worked, but didn't really understand what was driving excitement or investment in a particular coin.\n\nI got on the Metamask train about 6 months ago because I was curious about it and I wanted to trade currencies, and then when NFTs started popping up I played with them a little, but the gas fees made them seem like totally worthless and impractical toys.\n\nI also vaguely understood that you could \"build software on the blockchain\" and that people were doing this with dApps, but I struggled to understand what this might do for users aside from letting them trade these weird investment vehicles that only nerds cared about.\n\nWhat that whacked me upside the head about this was actually the NFT gaming space and BSC mainnet. On BSC, gas fees are on the order of 1-11 cents right now, which allowed me to play with the tech in a way that Ethereum was totally impractical for by the time I had Metamask.\n\nIf you haven't seen how this works, you have an addon in your browser (your \"wallet\") which contains crypto funds and you can one-click link it to a site you're visiting to interact with their services (of any kind, depending on what they've built).\n\nEven JUST looking at this, the ease and security of this, where you click to approve every transaction in Metamask, is already better than a credit card even if you're auto-filling it in with Chrome, which is more like a 4 click process with multiple keypresses.\n\nThis might not seem huge until you remember that streamlining a few clicks is a massive game changer. Amazon's one-click ordering was revolutionary when it launched because it massively reduced the friction of buying stuff.\n\nOkay so what do we actually have here? We have a piece of technology that ANY site can integrate with for financial transactions (txns), and those financial txns can be for fractions of a cent if that's appropriate for the use case.\n\nFurthermore, it operates using tokens (money) that are completely liquid, external to both parties, and basically universal because of the ease of exchanging them on DeFi (decentralized finance) exchanges for a fee significantly lower than a standard fiat exchange.\n\nI'm going to set the question of gas fees aside for a moment and will come back to that, but imagine that gas fees are near zero (fractions of a cent) for the purposes of this hypothetical, so it costs basically nothing to the user to approve a txn.\n\nWhy is this good and why should you care?\n\nIncentives, baby. Money makes the world go round. Every ad you see, every site you visit, every email client you access, and every platform you're on is making money from you somehow. It's how they provide the service to you.\n\nAnd often the value of that engagement is fractions of a cent. Ad purchases are often billed by either impressions or clicks and both have value depending on your goals (brand awareness or a purchase decision). But any individual impression is worth far less than one cent.\n\nSo often sites make ad revenue by offering a free service to users and then monetizing either exposure to eyeballs or selling information about those users to marketers who use it to move product. If the product is free, you're paying with your attention and your information.\n\nIf you could monetize your site engagement in an alternate way, you could free yourself from the hellish arms race of internet marketing by making it worth the platform's time to offer you a service without selling your information or making a costly purchase decision.\n\nSome sites take advantage of this now by explicitly charging you up front for services as their monetization model, but no one likes having a million $10 to 99-cent subscriptions on their credit card for apps they may or may not use much, and less isn't feasible for anyone.\n\nRemember that the actual value of the services you receive for an infrequently used app to either you or the provider of the service is somewhere BETWEEN $0.0001 and $0.99, but they can't really monetize you for less than a monthly charge of $0.99 unless they turn to ads.\n\nHistorically, ads have been the way to unlock the value of those fractional cents and they're what makes offering free services viable as a business model.\n\nYou can't charge an individual user $0.0001 cents every time they use your service, but you can charge an advertiser $100 for X impressions each of which are individually worth $0.0001 cents to that advertiser.\n\nEven if you use an aggressive ad blocker you're in an arms race, your demographic (or personal) info is still being resold, and you're still fighting a constant uphill battle against novel marketing techniques which are calculated to absorb your attention (and thus your time).\n\nThis is actually shockingly costly for you in ways you might not realize. If you value your personal time at even $20/hour, the 5 seconds you spent distracted by an ad or annoyed by an intrusive message cost you personally about $0.03, but you can't do much about it.\n\nAnd this doesn't even factor in the psychological toll of the onslaught of notifications and ads you're battling with every day, enabled by the platforms you use because *it's their business model*.\n\nIf you had some alternate means of compensating service providers for the actual value of engagement with their service at the same or better rate they get for selling 100 of your impressions to an advertiser, they have no need to do that.\n\nAds aren't my whole case here, by the way--this is just a very easy example to illustrate an area that this can enable.\n\nSo historically, even token-based compensation models where you buy X tokens for engagement are a terrible deal for users, which is why they don't work.\n\nYou need to deal with complicated mechanisms to store token balances and the overhead of getting users to make a token purchase decision and refill their balance and they can't cash out or move their tokens. Games use this model a lot.\n\nThe biggest barrier to adopting micro-payments like this are all of these annoying factors that prevent users from wanting to adopt any particular company's micropayment scheme (plus the company can just shred your tokens or change the contract when they feel like it).\n\nBut a universal wallet application that sites can seamlessly integrate with operated by a third party would solve all of these problems nicely. This hasn't been feasible before because the incentives to build and adopt such a system weren't there for anyone.\n\nPlus, how do you then trust THAT third party with your money and manage your balances there and ensure that they don't just monetize you too and cut backroom deals with the companies they support? It's never happened because it's a c\\*f for everyone.\n\nBut crypto wallets don't have this problem because they're decentralized and automated. The protocol and the network exists. The nodes are compensated by fees. Everything in the service is laid out in public and can be examined by anyone who wants to, and built by community.\n\nCompanies don't have to build anything special. They just have to integrate with the existing network. And they're incentivized to do that because there's a business opportunity (monetization models that are better for users).\n\nUsers benefit by retaining control of how they pay and what they pay for and being able to pay the ACTUAL value of the engagement in fractions of a cent, as well as keeping their money as liquid as cash, especially as more sites adopt the payment model.\n\nIt's actually even better than this--the psychological effect of numerous \"token spend\" decisions is distasteful, but with smart contracts you can establish conditions for automated spend that are publicly examinable, approve them, and not think about it anymore.\n\nThis means that with something like a Metamask integration (and near zero gas fees) you could one-click one-time approve something like Twitter to auto-bill you for usage at like 1 cent per month and never have to worry about ads creeping into your feed from the arms race.\n\nBut it gets even more interesting when you start thinking about mutually beneficial relationships. The value to Twitter of me writing a thread that gets a lot of engagement is not zero, due to platform attention. Other users benefit too from entertainment or new information.\n\nThe same contract could compensate me with fractions of a cent for every like or every bit of engagement I get equivalent to the actual value of that engagement for the service provider based on clearly established rules laid out in the smart contract.\n\nThis means that by just hanging out and making the space welcoming and inviting and having fun and positive interactions, the service could still be free for me to use or even net positive in a way that makes everyone happy and no one is annoyed by.\n\nThis would all be governed by a community-vetted smart contract with publicly examinable code and conditions that I opted into with a single click. Net positive better world than the current state of affairs. Everyone makes money. Everyone has more control over their attention and time.\n\nOkay so this is (maybe) cool, but so what right? This is all contingent on businesses actually building on this technology, everyone having something like MetaMask to use it, and gas fees for a txn being basically near-zero from my perspective, none of which is true... *yet*.\n\nAlso this is another obvious objection--no one wants to think about whether to spend $0.000001 every time they like a tweet. It feels scary and clunky.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image.png)\n\nLet's tackle each of these, starting with the last one.\n\nIn this model you don't *actually *have to make a purchase decision every time you like a tweet. The contract governs that and it could bill you in one txn every so often once intermediary software supports this, as just one example.\n\nWhen your monthly Twitter bill doesn't even register for you because it's on the order of $0.02 cents and it's totally opaque to you due to the smart contract and your one-click agreement, this FEELS the same as free.\n\nIt's just like ad monetization now: feels free, not free.\n\nYou never even see the bill (unless you want to) and you pay for exactly what you use, potentially offset by the value of utility you provide to the site community. If you're having fun and creating a lot of value for people, it actually MIGHT be free or net positive for you.\n\nNext up is the classic catch-22 of user adoption and network effects: No one wants to install MetaMask without a good reason (because it's complicated and scary) and no sites wanna build on tech no one uses no matter how cool it is or what new biz models it might enable.\n\nWell, guess what? Here's a fun metric:\n\n\"In July 2020 the platform saw 545,080 MAUs and by April 2021, Metamask had 3 million MAUs. Today, Metamask has 10,354,279 MAUs and has grown 1,800% since July 2020.\"\n\n[https://news.bitcoin.com/metamask-surpasses-10-million-monthly-active-users-climbing-1800-in-12-months/](https://t.co/kPWwyuimx1)\n\nWhat's driving this adoption is people starting to catch on to the vision, users actually playing with crypto in the ways it was envisioned to be used, and businesses starting to support this.\n\nJust kidding, it's largely speculation on being able to make $$$ on crypto.\n\nBut that's TOTALLY okay! In fact, that's great. The speculation >>> understanding the tech >>> buying into the vision pipeline is real and it's a GOOD thing.\n\nRemember how financial incentives make the world go round? People follow the money.\n\nThere's a TON of money to be made by bringing micro txns into services. Finance platforms front-ran this, but we're seeing it with games now too beginning in earnest this summer.\n\nAxie Infinity did $42 Million in sales in June 2021 alone. That's $500M in annual revenue.\n\nFor comparison, Marvel Strike Force has been one of the top grossing games in the app store forever and did $300M in revenue last year. It's a major brand backed by major players designed to monetize its player base.\n\nFinancials like this make everyone perk up.\n\nStop and think about that for a sec. You're an investor looking to grow your wealth. A random game comes out of nowhere and does almost 1/6th of one of the top grossing apps in the app store in revenue in its first month of operation.\n\nFinancial incentives drive interest.\n\nFurthermore, all of this interest and money flying around gets USERS more interested. People wanna know what this new hotness is. People see crypto price growth in this sector and wanna learn to play with it. People (hi its me) install MetaMask just to play around.\n\nThis creates a self-reinforcing cycle where there's more money in play, more tech is being adopted, and more businesses want to get in on a piece of this because time to market == $$$. Both businesses and users have incentives to get involved.\n\nAdoption in some specific sectors and some nerdy circles sparks interest and adoption in other sectors, as people with specialized industry knowledge start to grok the concept and realize that they can adapt it for use in THEIR domain too.\n\nAs this radiates out and more users begin to understand it conceptually, they can better explain it to their friends, who then have more confidence in trying it themselves. I explained how crypto tech actually works to my roommate last night and blew her mind.\n\nShe just bought into Solana for $1000 and *actually understands *what she's buying and why it might appreciate now. This is different from crypto investing a year ago for most retail investors.\n\nThis is better than aping in because it's an investment in the vision and an understanding of how this might actually translate to financial growth and gains which is closer to traditional investing (compared to my very dumb dabbling with dog coins for fun).\n\nSo this potential future vision is really cool, right? You can see how it's self-reinforcing and incentives are there for growth and how it's not just a ponzi scheme.\n\nOne big glaring problem with this nice utopian vision: scaling and gas fees.\n\nIf you, like me, have wanted to play in the NFT space and poked around with MetaMask because it's hot, you've probably been absolutely appalled by gas fees. It's like $100-$200+ dollars for ANY transaction on the ETH network right now.\n\nYou couldn't claim the totally free NFTs I posted the other day without spending over $100 for the privilege to own a collectible which didn't benefit me at all and might not appreciate ever.\n\nThis makes the crypto micro txns vision look absolutely insane to anyone with a brain because when most people can't cover a $500 emergency, no one is going to spend $100 to send a fraction of a cent to someone.\n\nBut tech, fortunately, isn't static. Last-gen crypto provided a concept template that we're already iterating on.\n\nYou might have heard about this little altcoin Solana that's grown 7000% since launching.\n\nDumb apes doing dumb ape shit amirite? 🙄\n\nBut actually maybe not. Why is Solana so cool?\n\nTo understand that, you have to understand why the gas fees on ETH are too damn high.\n\nThe way that crypto works (roughly) is that every node talks to every other node to agree on the transactions that occurred using a technology called Proof of Stake (and previously Proof of Work).\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp](https://t.co/IpFORGqTB2)\n\nRight now, the way that your transactions get processed on the blockchain involves bidding for your transaction to get included in the next processed block that validates transactions. This is what you're paying for when you pay gas fees.\n\nBut the processing power available for this AND the need for the nodes to all communicate and agree on the conditions of the txns are computationally expensive and create bottlenecks. Only so many slots can be processed as it scales. More use = higher bids to get a slot.\n\nEthereum is working on solving this problem by trying to move from a PoW to a PoS system, which is what ETH2 is all about.\n\nA PoS system dramatically improves the efficiency of the network to process txns.\n\n[https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/](https://t.co/fS4VKJ5dnB)\n\nRemember that reducing gas fees is what moves us closer to ACTUALLY usable micro txn tech at scale, because the cost of the txn has to be low enough to make txn worthwhile for both parties. You can't build a micro txn system when the cost of doing business is a mega txn.\n\nEven with Proof of Stake, we still have some significant processing power required for agreement between nodes at scale to sort out the txns, and it's unclear to what degree PoS will solve the current gas woes (in spite of big claims).\n\nIt might work really well! It might even get them down to where they need to be. Either way it's an improvement.\n\nBut enter Solana: Solana introduces a new model called PoH (proof of history) that they say in an improvement even over pure PoS.\n\n[https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-a-clock-for-blockchain-cf47a61a9274](https://t.co/Re1WKT23BB)\n\nWithout going too deep into the guts of how this works (go read the article if you wanna learn more), PoH says it can make txns even more efficient by reducing the computational aspect of timestamp agreement between nodes.\n\nThis is very exciting if it works out, because it means that we're potentially in reach of txn volume on the scale of Visa but with txn costs at many subfractions of $0.01.\n\nSuddenly the economics are feasible again. Solana is out today and already uses this model.\n\nThe businesses and users looking at these models like the tech, but need it to be financially viable. Solana (and ADA and ETH2) are the frontrunners right now that seem to be capable of making this model financially viable or at least moving us MUCH closer than we were.\n\nTxns at fractions of a cent at scale, widely used by a rapidly increasing number of users and businesses, open a whole world of possibilities for the design and implementation of smart contracts and actually make some of these micro-engagements I described earlier viable.\n\nThis is a big part of why Solana is shooting up right now. It's not just aping (although there's plenty of aping). It's that people looking toward future financial incentives, who \"get\" crypto, are looking for solutions that solve the core problems of the existing protocols.\n\nLaying a bet on Solana (or ADA or ETH2) is making a bet on the future success of this economic model given the factors I've described here whether you realize what you're doing or not.\n\nRight now you might think that crypto seems like a wasteful, useless toy for nerds.\n\nBut consider that this is also what computers looked like in 1980 to most people because they were staring at the present landscape and didn't fully grasp how it would evolve to be integrated with all levels of business as a \\_superior solution\\_.\n\n\"Why would I buy an IBM and pay a monthly fee to a telecom company for a janky and complicated 14.4 modem connection so that I can email my friend when I can just call her instead?\"\n\nGood point. But you're not appreciating a future state with this objection.\n\n\"Why would anyone have a website or hand their credit card information over to some faceless company you can't even see when they can run away with your payment info? The site is useless anyway.\"\n\nYes, true in 1998. Today it's not and seems silly to imagine.\n\nBusinesses and users who \\_do\\_ get the potential and move in early get to reap the benefits of being early movers in the space and will continue to grow it whether you think it's dumb or not, like the guy making fun of PCs in 1990.\n\nSo anyway, this is all why I'm crypto-pilled now. Some of it is just ponzi schemes and aping. But the underlying technology \\_isn't\\_ and is poised to rapidly explode and generate entirely new consumer-oriented business models as we work to solve these problems.\n\nLet's look at some of the original comments on this thread: Sai makes a great point about disclosing incentives. FWIW, I'm heavily invested in crypto and particularly in ETH2, ADA, and SOL, plus a bunch of speculative bets. Do your own research, don't just trust what I say.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-1.png)\n\nJessa makes a good point about the total value of crypto vs other total wealth allocation. This amount is WAY up over the last few years and seems likely to continue to grow. More self-reinforcement via financial incentives.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-2.png)\n\nRohit makes a good point about resistance from legacy incentives. This is all so new there are absolutely downstream issues and conflicts with existing systems and incentives that aren't immediately visible to everyone. As with any new tech (like the internet) we'll have to solve them for wider adoption.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-3.png)\n\nSai isn't wrong about it maybe being too early even for value-based investment in the underlying technology of coins that aren't just ponzi schemes. We haven't seen it really work yet. But we're on the precipice of that as a potential!\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-4.png)\n\nCharlie is correct that the tax situation is a nightmare right now. But we already have services like Koinly coming out to help ease the burden of tax calculation. This is a big enough problem that solutions will spring up quickly.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-5.png)\n\nA cool thing about blockchains is that solutions can easily be built to calculate your reporting requirements and tax burden if you enter all your wallet addresses.\n\nToday, Paypal eliminates the burden of 1099s for contractors paid through their platform.\n\nI expect that we'll see a LOT of innovation in this space as micro txns become more mainstream that will virtually eliminate this as a burden, and as businesses begin to make money they'll lobby to ease the tax reporting issues because it'll be an adoption barrier for them.\n\n![](https://liminalwarmth.com/content/images/2021/09/image-6.png)\n\nIt's true that the signal to noise ratio is REALLY bad right now, which is why threads like this are important so that you understand the potential of what you're aping into and why some coins are better than others as long-term investment vehicles.\n\nGot more comments or questions?

{"id": "ot2alclGTFtpvg9B4I2aB3Hx4Av_zj6J3-_jMPPi5Vg", "title": "DeFi 101: All About Crypto", "body": "Let's talk about crypto tonight. The last three months have been a crash course for me as I've increasingly experimented in the DeFi space. I thought it might be useful to do a short primer on some of the many confusing concepts that baffled me on first contact here.\n\nI want to give a high-level overview on some of the weirder terms and concepts you'll see get thrown around: pools, farms, NFTs, staking, liquid defi, and margin trading.\n\nIt's not as complicated as it looks at first. The UX in this space is really bad. I'll also touch briefly on DAOs and what I'm seeing there, beyond [what I already discussed here](https://twitter.com/liminal_warmth/status/1441180281591844865).\n\nOne of the interesting things about this space is it's so incredibly new. Extremely veteran experts have a few years of experience at most. You can become an expert fast just by jumping in and playing around. Blue sky, green field, tons of opportunity. Very very early days.\n\nI'm going to assume that you have a basic understanding of what crypto is here. If you don't, the story is that a bunch of computers mutually agree on number balances in a ledger. You can write code to create circumstances under which these balances change (\"smart contracts\").\n\nYou can interact with established versions of these smart contracts on websites by \"connecting your wallet\" to them, which basically opts you in to their smart contract that allows exchanges to happen (which you consent to).\n\nUsually this is done by connecting a browser-based wallet (MetaMask, SolFlare, etc) to the site in question by clicking a button and approving it. Then you're allowed to take actions to interact with that site using the coins you've sent to that wallet address.\n\nSo you have a wallet in your browser, you sent some coins to it (from Coinbase or wherever), and you're ready to jump into DeFi. What can you do, and why would you do it?\n\nThe most basic use case is simple swaps: trading one currency for another currency on sites like Uniswap.\n\nThere are tons of these around, and you can only trade on the protocols that support the wallet and currency you want to use. Solana and Ethereum and Binance all operate on different protocols, and you can't directly trade coins across them.\n\nThere are mechanisms called \"bridge protocols\" from established providers that can be used to swap currency across chains, and they basically work by taking your currency on one chain and sending it to a wallet address on a different chain that you specify.\n\nSome wallets like MetaMask support multiple chains and you can operate across multiple networks by switching your network on the dropdown at the top. You still need to use a bridge to swap your coins over though.\n\nBy using these decentralized finance portals, or **DeFi** sites, you can quickly and directly trade coins on your own without going through a third party service like coinbase, which is \"custodial.\" They hold coins on your behalf, which means you really need to trust them.\n\n**Custodial services** can be great for security, but you run the risk of them disappearing with your coins (Mt. Gox anyone?) and you can't do anything if they have technical issues (I spent a week not being able to send SOL I bought on Coinbase due to tech issues).\n\nThe flipside of this is that your personal (MetaMask/Solflare/etc) wallet is only as secure as your personal risk management is. Do your research, consider using a cold wallet, and don't put all your doge in one wallet.\n\nThis feels scary at first but you get over it fast.\n\nSo Uniswap and Pancakeswap have been two of the historically most popular sites for DeFi, on the ETH and Binance chains respectively, and I'm going to use them to explain the next few DeFi concepts.\n\nEvery time you swap coins on these sites, they take a small fee.\n\nUsually when you're trading in a market, the market matches people who want to sell at the current price with people who want to buy at the current price.\n\nBut what if there isn't someone who wants to trade with your coins at the current market clearing price on this site?\n\nThis is where pools and farms come in. **Pools** are liquidity pools, which is a defi innovation where people put up an equally valued amount of Coin A and Coin B in a locked pairing in order to facilitate trades between those coins.\n\nThis means that you don't actually have to be matched with another human who wants to sell in order to make an exchange between those coins. The pool itself facilitates the exchange by always having both types of currency in the pool.\n\nSo a USDC-ETH pool, for example, would have 1 ETH for every 3000 USDC in it right now because 1 ETH is roughly equivalent to that dollar amount. The pool is constantly rebalanced to keep this mostly even.\n\nBecause these pools are supplied by the coins of individuals who voluntarily put them up by locking them into the pool's contract, you need people to want to do this.\n\nThe incentive is you get a variable amount of the fees from the swaps made by this pool by contributing.\n\nTo represent your ownership of the coins you have locked in the pool, you receive a fixed number of coins back from your position in the pool that are usually represented by a pairing of the pools coins. Put in 3000 USDC and 1 ETH, and get back 3001 USDC-ETH tokens.\n\nThese live in your wallet until you decide you want to exit the pool, at which point you go back and trade them in to receive the same number of tokens back that you put in. However, the pool is always being rebalanced to maintain the relative value of the pool's coins.\n\nSo if there are large price movements in the RELATIVE value of the two coins you have paired (in either direction), you may lose money if you cash out at that point. This is called **Impermanent Loss** and you should read about it if you want to play in this space.\n\nYou can either hold these liquidity pool tokens to collect the fees you've earned when you eventually redeem them or in some cases place the tokens into a \"farm\" offered by a provider for an additional rate of return. A farm is a separate smart contract from the pool.\n\n**Farms** expose you to additional risk by allowing someone to take your liquidity position and use it for whatever DeFi activities they'd like (lending your position) in exchange for this additional APR that varies by the amount of capital in the farm.\n\nWhen you remove your tokens from the farm, you should always get the same number of liquidity tokens that you put in (3001 USDC-ETH is still 3001 USDC-ETH), but you need to trust the provider you're handing your coins to. Most major exchanges are as safe as anything here.\n\nIn theory, these compounded gains (in general) should offset any impermanent loss you incur unless you paired a very unstable coin in a relatively stable coin for the liquidity pool. You'll see very high return rates on stablecoin pools and farms (USDC-any for example).\n\nThis is necessary because you should EXPECT movement of most assets in either direction from stablecoins given the historical volatility of crypto markets. Coins that move tightly together or are more stable offer lower rates (less risk).\n\nSo when you're pairing coins for liquidity that don't move tightly together (like ETH and a random dog coin) you need to factor in your risk due to impermanent loss from the price movement and your willingness to ride that movement out (or risk it never recovering).\n\nFarms usually reward you with tokens issued by the managing site which represent your portion of the rewards and which rise in value as those sites earn more from in fees from exchanges on their protocol (so PancakeSwap awards \"CAKE\" and Uniswap awards \"UNI\").\n\nAll of this is just 2 layers of lending levels designed to offer you a return on your position, and you need to compare the total expected APR against the likelihood of any particular coin raising or lowering in value (just hodling your coins).\n\nYou also need to compare this against **Staking **your coins, which is a lending alternative to all this liquidity and farming stuff by doing a direct lend of your coins to a smart contract in exchange for a fixed APR, usually used by a validator node to facilitate the network.\n\nUnlike these other options, \"staking\" your coins often involves a lock-up period where you can't pull your coins back out until the end of the lock up period. The returns you earn come from the rewards of validating blocks instead of enabling coin swaps.\n\nYour coins are fairly safe if you stake with a reputable validator, and you still technically own them in most cases via a smart contract claim (though they're not in your wallet). The rates for this tend to be lower than liquidity farming, because the risks are lower.\n\nAll of these are lending instruments that allow you to earn additional gains on your coins over holding and you back out of your position by going to the site with the contract and exiting your position once the lock-up period is over. Some wallets also offer direct staking.\n\nIncreasingly, staking providers are now offering you tokens in exchange for your stake which offers you a way to access the coins that are locked up in the stake by giving you a tradeable token representing your \"stake\" with that contract.\n\nYou can send, sell, or trade these tokens like any other currency, and anyone holding the token can redeem it from the provider for that tokens share of the stake pool. These tokens increase in value based on the validator fees collected by the stake pool.\n\n**Liquid staking** is a newer concept used by some protocols like Solana where you can sidestep the staking lock-up period entirely by offering your coins to a provider who spreads them across validators and operates kind of like a staking exchange. Marinade is one example.\n\nYou want lots of network validators active on the chain for complex technical reasons related to network health, and liquid staking allows someone else to manage that while issuing one central token to you that increases in value while you hold it.\n\nAnyone can put their SOL up on Marinade (and sites like it) and let Marinade manage the network health while taking their promissory tokens and going to go do other DeFi stuff with them (like the aforementioned liquidity farming).\n\nThis gets very tricky when you do stuff like this because you're now operating through THREE levels of lending if you dump your liquid staking tokens in a liquidity pool and then farm them. Kinda gotta do some complex financial wizardry to figure out if it's worth it.\n\nThis is also where things start to get kinda wild wild west and fun, though. Basically all of these things are risk and return management tools. You can take on as much risk as you're comfortable with for ever-increasing returns (and oh boy can it get risky).\n\nBecause now we get into **lending** and **margin trading**. There's yet another thing you can do with your coins (or any of the secondary tokens from any of these positions): You can put them up as collateral for margin trading on sites like Solend.\n\nBecause all of these tokens have immediate market value and uses in lending and borrowing via the markets and instruments we've already discussed, sites like Solend will let you lend these coins and instruments to other people who want to borrow them for fixed rates.\n\nNote that this differs from the previous scenarios in that your coins (when lending) are relatively safe through a lending broker because they often have automated liquidation of borrowed positions that get out of balance to ensure they can return your coins when you want.\n\nThis is more like peer to peer lending via a brokered pool of currency, and the rates for lending tend to increase as more of a particular currency in demand. There are still risks here, and you should read about them. But it's more like staking with no lock-up.\n\nMany of these sites allow you to use your lent currency as collateral to borrow other kinds of currency, up to 80% of the coins you have put up as collateral. So if you have 1 ETH staked in their pool, you can borrow up to .8 ETH of value in any currency you like.\n\nWhy would you do this? Well one reason might be if you have a short term need for currency but don't want to realize gains on a coin you hold. Putting it up as collateral (at this time) does not trigger a taxable event.\n\nSo you can borrow against ETH that you hold, which locks it in the smart contract, and borrow USDC that you can use for whatever you like without triggering a taxable event on your underlying ETH (no gain for using borrowed funds). You do have to repay the loan.\n\nAgain, this is the wild wild west, so this might change at any time with new guidance, but right now this works the same as putting up your house for a bank loan (which you know as a mortgage). You get taxed when you sell your house, not on the money you borrowed against it.\n\nAnd this also unlocks new kinds of uses for tokens that couldn't otherwise be easily converted for trading or lending.\n\nSome sites, like Parrot Protocol, will take your liquidity tokens (which you'd normally farm) and allow you to mint tradeable stablecoins from them.\n\nIf you're dizzy at this point, I'm not surprised. This is a lot and it's hard to wrap your head around until you actually see it in action.\n\nRemember that this is just layers upon layers of lending activity. Each step is increasing your risk for a return you need to calculate\n\nThe bottom line is that if you want to margin yourself to the hilt for 3000% annual returns that you have to watch on a hair trigger for flash crashes, you can do this. Stare at charts to your heart's content with your finger over the \"withdraw\" button.\n\nIf that's not your jam, take your ETH and lock it into a stake pool on Coinbase for 5% annual returns until they let go of it.\n\nThere's a risk level and playground to suit anyone looking for a particular use case or return on their coins.\n\nWhat's interesting is that these are tools and strategies that aren't normally available to the average Joe and most people have no idea WTF we're doing here for both complexity and novel tech reasons. But people in finance have done this stuff forever.\n\nPlay at your own risk!\n\nBut even the most paltry and risk averse staking play is offering returns comparable to or better than the \"historical average\" 7% safety situation of the stock market index, and potentially many multiples of that if you increase your risk a bit.\n\nYes, you're taking on underlying risk by even leaving money in the crypto market anyway (which is what people will be quick to point out), and also if you're playing around with ETH or newer coins like SOL or FTM or BNB, which are more volatile.\n\nBut if you're long and hodling on those coins anyway, all of these instruments are ways to let your coins work for you via investment tools instead of just having them sit in a cold wallet somewhere, and it's worth looking at if you want to maximize returns.\n\nFinally, I want to take one sec to explain **NFTs **and **DAOs **a little bit. I plan to do an entirely separate thread on NFTs at some point, because I want to follow up my last thread on them this spring, which was much more bearish because I didn't understand them as well.\n\nThe NFT market is ablaze with hype at the moment, and if you wanna trade while the trading is good, by all means play there (I am, badly, and still learning the market). But the real value of NFTs is not just ponzi trading on jpegs even if it looks like that right now.\n\n**NFTs **are exactly what they're labeled on the tin: they're uniquely identifiable tokens which can have their ownership validated on the block chain. There actually are a myriad of uses for them, and ecosystems are already springing up around them.\n\nI touched on this a little bit [in this thread](https://twitter.com/EnzikaOfAsh/status/1442627854894723077), and I want to follow up on the potential future use cases in a separate thread later, as I said. But for now, just trust that there IS real utility beyond the excited hype of the moment.\n\nAs for **DAOs**, this is probably the least-well understood concept in crypto right now because it's one of the newest. DAO stands for **Decentralized Autonomous Organization**. It's an extremely flexible way to pool resources and organize with other individuals on the blockchain.\n\nDAOs are governed by smart contracts whose rules are specific to the DAO, but usually has a coin/resource pool and a voting mechanism that allows members of the DAO to decide how to allocate those resources in the service of a shared mission.\n\nThis can be anything from a small art project to a fully resourced organization attempting a digital replacement for an incorporated co-op (or even potentially a virtual, decentralized nation). I unpacked the co-op vision a bit [in this thread](https://twitter.com/liminal_warmth/status/1441180281591844865).\n\nThe most interesting aspect of DAOs is that they're a way to pool funds for shared goals in a way that doesn't actually require knowing one another or even having trust. The contract is published. The votes are visible. You can check the smart contract code.\n\nIt remains to be seen how useful this ends up being or how they'll evolve in coming years, but they're so very new and this space is so fresh and fast moving that I'm SURE I'm missing things about them just like I did before I wrapped my head around every other part of crypto.\n\nI'm sure I'll write about these more in coming months too as I become more familiar with the space and novel and interesting use cases present themselves. But there's a LOT of cool energy here and it's one of the most cutting edge tech spaces you can operate in.\n\nWhen you combine NFTs, ICOs, and DAOs, spinning up and funding a new project with people from all over the world has never been faster or easier than it is at this moment. It's moving so fast that legislation can barely track it right now (let alone keep up).\n\nIt's fascinating to watch. It feels like the very early days of the internet when it was first catching pop culture's imagination. Anything could happen, and we're just getting started.\n\nMoney makes the world go round and this space is rolling in it.\n\nIf you're a young, tech-savvy person looking to make their mark on the tech scene, here's my advice: if you're not learning everything you can about AI/ML, you should be participating in a DAO and working on a Web3 application.\n\nYesterday's Jobs, Gates, Zuckerberg, and Bezos were building on the back of Web 1.0 and Web 2.0.\n\nTomorrow's version of those guys is working on Web 3.0 right now.\n\nPay attention.\n", "timestamp": 1633453969, "digest": "OAI8lT3ufwFaeEqTB-35eMzKG4mtjkQoRpU5OwPvs9A", "contributor": "0x0150C68d9d87F10446EeC313D732397B5DB09280"}

{"id": "WQDNPWRnLzsxugTUmVoi-8TBv-xq-CHeS4ph9GGw0NI", "title": "The Case for Cash vs Margin: Crypto Tax Edition", "body": "Let's pretend that you owe the IRS $10,000 USD in taxes.\n\nYou can afford to pay this from your bank savings, but you also have $20k in Solana at current prices that has appreciated 100% since you bought it for $10k six months ago.\n\nYou could sell half to pay taxes but then you’d owe another $2000 in taxes on the $5000 gain (assuming 40% tax rate). You are annoyed by this because your tax burden is already high this year. Plus, you want to hodl on your crypto investment anyway.\n\nThe problem is that you recognize that using cash and _not_ selling your crypto to pay this tax you owe now (to a debtor with lots of guns) is effectively making an additional $10k cash bet on the future of Solana. You’re not sure if you want to do that.\n\nWat do?\n\nYou decide to put $20k Solana up as collateral to borrow $10k USD coin at 8% APY and convert that to fiat to pay your taxes. You are at 50% borrowing leverage and liquidation will happen at 70%, so as long as Solana does not drop by 30%, you’re fine.\n\nThe government men with guns are happy and you now owe a shady defi network $10k USDC which will cost you roughly $800 per year (compounding) till you pay it back.\n\nWhat happens next if you make no more moves during the following year?\n\n**Case 1: Solana Goes Up 100%**\n\nSolana once again doubles in value over the following 12 months and your collateral is now worth $40k. You can go back and pay your $10,800 in USDC to settle your loan at any time and release it back to your wallet. You pay this now from cash and recover your collateral with no tax burden. (Gain $9.2k)\n\nIf you had converted your crypto for fiat to pay your taxes last year, you would only have $20k in Solana and you’d still owe the IRS $2000 from the conversion, but you would have kept your 10k cash. (Loss $12k)\n\nIf you had paid $10k cash out of pocket last year, you would just have your $40k worth of Solana. (Gain $10k)\n\n**Case 2: Solana Stays Flat**\n\nSolana moves hardly at all this year and your collateral is still worth about $20k. You could choose to pay your debt now in cash and recover the collateral for $10.8k, which you do because you’ve decided you want out of the crypto game. (Loss $800)\n\nIf you had converted your crypto for fiat to pay your taxes last year, you would have your flat $10k left in Solana, and you’d still owe the IRS $2000 from the conversion, but you would have kept your 10k cash. (Loss $2k)\n\nIf you had just paid your taxes in cash last year, you wouldn’t be any better or worse off than you were. (No change)\n\n**Case 3: Solana Flash Crashes 30% and Recovers**\n\nSome passing defi news event occurs that causes your Solana value to drop by 30% of what it was worth when you took out the loan, but it recovers within a day or two. Unfortunately, this auto-liquidated your collateral to pay your loan when you hit 70% borrowing leverage (when your collateral was worth about $14k).\n\nYou no longer have a debt and you got to keep your $10k cash from last year, but you only have $4.2k left in Solana (after the market recovers from the 30% dip). Extra sad is that this (most likely ??) triggered a tax liability for you when they sold your coins—the only silver lining is they did it at market low, so your tax burden is reduced to about $1.2k.\n\nAlso, you believe the coin will recover, so as soon as it starts climbing from the crash you take your cash $10k and reinvest it into Solana, capturing 70% of the climb back up in value to flat (approx. 21%). You now have an additional $12.1k in SOL. (Loss $14.9k)\n\nIf you had sold crypto to pay tax last year, you’d owe the IRS $2k, have kept your $10k cash, and wait out the dip until your SOL was worth $10k again. (Loss $2k)\n\nIf you had just paid your taxes in cash last year, you wouldn’t be any better or worse off than you were. (No change)\n\n**Case 4: Solana Crashes 80% and Does Not Recover**\n\nSomething bad happens that has major market impacts and Solana does not recover. It loses 80% of its value and stays there. As with the last case, you were auto-liquidated on the way down. You no longer have a debt to pay, but your remaining SOL is only worth $200.\n\nYou owe the IRS $1.2k from the liquidation, but you can sell your remaining SOL to offset this gain with a loss. You still have your $10k cash. (Loss $10k)\n\nIf you had sold crypto to pay tax last year, you’d owe the IRS $2k, have kept your $10k cash, and could now sell your SOL worth $1k to offset what you owe the IRS, but you’re still out your $20k. (Loss $20k)\n\nIf you had paid cash last year, you’d be out $10k cash and your SOL would only be worth $2k. (Loss $28k)\n\n**Discussion**\n\nWhat does this look like if we lay it out in a chart?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vRGFAmHgHQribQZIwXMTn.png?height=178&width=433)\n\nWe can basically throw selling your crypto to pay taxes directly out the window—it’s a bad option in every case except for the flash crash scenario, and then only if you trust yourself not to panic sell your position when your SOL is tanking.\n\nThis is the coward’s hedge. If the market crashes, you lose big. If the market gains, you lose big.\n\nThe only reason you should consider this option is if you’re trying to reduce your exposure to crypto intentionally, but you want to do it over time because you have FOMO and you’re indecisive. This seems like a weird strategy to me, but you do you.\n\nNow you have the question of borrowing vs paying cash. Paying cash actually turns out to be the worst option on the board if SOL tanks and doesn’t recover. You’re out the money plus your crypto.\n\nThis was the unfortunate position of lots of people when they got their tax bill after the 2017 ICO crash and had to fork over cash to pay the tab (especially if they got out entirely at that point).\n\nBut it’s the best option if SOL does really well (which makes sense, because remember that this is the equivalent of laying an extra $10k bet on SOL from your cash savings at tax time).\n\nBorrowing, on the other hand, is by FAR your best option in the event of a total value collapse (you’re only out $10k rather than $20k or $28k for the other scenarios). If the currency stays flat, you’re also no worse off except for the interest you’re paying. If it goes up, you still get to capture those gains and only have to pay the interest. So you can think of this as an $800/year insurance policy against your currency losing all its value.\n\nThere’s only one problem with this: the flash crash scenario where your collateral gets auto-liquidated. It’s the worst scenario on the board for you outside of total market meltdown (although not much worse than if you had sold SOL to pay taxes and it does well, which is another reminder not to use that option).\n\nIf you can avoid a flash liquidation event, borrowing offers you the best across-the-board outcomes for any of the possible market conditions.\n\nFlash liquidation is worst when the market dips sharply due to some news and then recovers shortly after before you can take any mitigation action. For heavily traded coins most news doesn’t dip them that hard unless the volatility is already super high (like when SOL was up to $210 and down to $110 this last month before settling at $130-140ish like it is now).\n\nIf things are fairly stable, a 30-40% dip on news which recovers same day is extremely unlikely. The thing about holding cash in reserve for this possibility is that you can re-enter when things start trending up again or when they stabilize and recapture some of the loss even if you do get hit (and if it doesn’t recover you’re in the market crash scenario anyway).\n\nBut better not to get hit in the first place. So what can you do to avoid this bad, expensive outcome?\n\nWell, for one thing, you could increase your collateral and spread your position across several different coins. If you’ve been HODLing bitcoin or ETH, you can add to your leverage position so that you’re only 30% exposed or 40% exposed and that any single asset dipping doesn’t jeopardize your overall position.\n\nYou could also be super extra safe and not ever borrow more than 15-20% of your collateral, because if that triggers an auto-liquidation you’re also in a total market meltdown scenario. But now you’re taking on risk from having more and more money up for collateral with a single lender, tied to a single wallet. Putting up $80k to borrow $10k isn’t a great idea unless you wanted $80k with the lender anyway.\n\nBut there are two things we haven’t discussed yet: crypto appreciation and returns on collateral.\n\nAll of these flash crash cases have worked with an assumption that the value of your currency has stayed flat (or close to flat). For the last several years, all of the heavily traded coins have steadily appreciated (and if you’re long crypto you expect this to continue). As your coins appreciate, your leverage position on the money you borrowed will slowly increase, so unless you flash crash the day after you borrow, your risk should decrease over time.\n\nIf the value fluctuates but _doesn’t_ flash crash, you have time to add more collateral (and further reduce your risk) or pay back your debt and retrieve your precious, non-appreciating coins if you’re getting too close to your liquidation threshold for comfort.\n\nFurthermore, you’re also earning interest on your collateral. Not a ton at .18-.5% for Solana, but not nothing, so this also further erodes your leverage risk.\n\nIf the coins continue to appreciate year over year, you could (in theory) do this as often as you wanted to and at a rate of leverage risk you’re comfortable with to continue to pay tax this way.\n\nIn fact, the implication here is that it’s advantageous from both a tax and a risk perspective to pay for everything you’d otherwise pay cash for this way, if your crypto vault is sufficiently overflowing to mitigate the liquidation risk.\n\nThe thing that gives me the most pause here is that I’m not actually crypto-wealthy enough to be willing to concentrate sufficient assets with a single lender to try this strategy… but if I could do it with 20% of my total crypto holdings?\n\nI’d be paying rent in borrowed crypto every month, baby.", "timestamp": 1633454068, "digest": "LZYnN1SLuLZQShNKa8HiIDT9sjRaccETTKapFyD_cgg", "contributor": "0x0150C68d9d87F10446EeC313D732397B5DB09280"}

Creators will soon build monetizable competitions and engage with their audiences in new ways. I believe that Twitch Versus is the first step in the direction of a “Tournaments as a Service” model that other companies and startups will adopt, and this will fundamentally create a new type of marketplace economy.\n\n## Introduction - Broadcast Systems and Esports\n\nTwitch is a live streaming platform focused on gaming and esports that has slowly grown into new niches like live music production, cooking, and interviews. Content creators have the ability to produce content, find an audience through the recommendation systems, and monetize all within the platform, making Twitch the most viable platform to build an audience and income. Likewise, esports has found a home on Twitch for the exact same reasons. Youtube also has a subsection of live streaming esports content, but the bulk of its value comes as a store for videos on demand (VODs) and the strength of its recommendation systems.\n\n## Two Previous Successfully Run Creator Tournaments\n\nNinja, one of the most prominent live streamers on Twitch, was paid purportedly $30 million to switch to another streaming service, Mixer, only for it to shut down after a few months. While Ninja was paid very handsomely, the most interesting aspect of the deal to me was Ninja Battles, a weekly cash pool tournament he attached his brand to on Mixer in which players and streamers competed in. The entire tournament was the first of its kind, professionally casted, and presumably bankrolled by Mixer as a way to bring more views to the nascent platform. My understanding is that Mixer took a two pronged approach for signing Ninja: signing a top tier content creator with both the casual streaming audience and professional integrity to be attached to a tournament. Unfortunately, Mixer was shut down before any real growth could be witnessed, but one can’t help but wonder about what could happen if a creator were to host a tournament all on his or her own...\n\nEnter the Tyler1 Championship (TCS), hosted by the infamous Tyler1, a League of Legends streamer, competitor, and commentator who has had many documented bouts of toxicity and lack of integrity. Tyler1 turned over a new leaf, channelling his over the top personality into hilarious and insightful streams, and created the most successful unofficial League of Legends tournament, even eclipsing the Academy League in many eyes.\n\n> Tyler1 being in his element and being the natural entertainer he is for the TCS Grand Finals.\n\nThe North American League of Legends competitive scene is centered around the League of Legends Championship Series (LCS) and, to a lesser extent, the Academy League, but doesn't provide enough competitive experience outside of those two leagues. The TCS provided that gray space between professional and amateur players, allowing players to compete on a semi-professional level with the audience of a regular tournament. Most of the audience was there for Tyler1 himself, who commentated the entire tournament with a variety of skits, costumes, and backgrounds to suit his zany style, cementing the belief that creator tournaments can be successful.\n\n## “Tournaments As A Service”\n\nNinja Battles and the TCS both share a creator driven model, and there is more than enough proof to show that this is a viable model. Enter Twitch Versus and what I dub as “Tournaments as a Service”. The thesis is that a creator has enough cachet and knowledge in a game to bring an audience and other players to a tournament, and this concentration will attract sponsorships. The four main components are the Creator, who sets the format, style, and duration of the competition, the Competitors, seeking cash prizes, notoriety, and social media clout, Sponsors, who see a marketing and branding opportunity, and the Audience, brought in through loyalty for competitors, creator, or for the sheer spectacle of competition. This 4 sided marketplace only exists in the abstract right now, and if Twitch or any other company can implement this idea, creators will gain another to monetize and drive value to their audiences.\n\n> Ninja playing Fortnite with Chicago rapper, Lil Durk, goes to show how large Ninja’s influence is on media.\n\nAs mentioned, Twitch Versus is just the first attempt at TaaS, and doesn’t include any monetization paths yet. Some questions I have going forward are: will streaming companies such as Twitch be able to take a cut of the total raised sponsorship money as a percentage on top of the Stripe processor? Will ad revenue be split between creators and platforms? Can platforms allow audiences to crowdsource the prize pool themselves, adding even more engagement and support from the audience? All of these questions and more will be answered in the upcoming years, and I am incredibly excited to see how TaaS matures.\n\nI want to leave the readers with 4 more concrete ideas about how TaaS will add to the Passion Economy.\n\n1. **Decentralize The Tournament Structure:** I touched on this topic briefly in the big about the TCS; most Esports tournaments are conducted by game developers, who have to think about the bottom line and branding at all moments. This often leads to vibrant and thriving communities often being left out of the traditional esports scene as game developers prioritize bigger markets (think Global North / metropolitan areas). Proper implementation of TaaS will spread the concentration of esports away from big western markets and large game developers towards individual content creators playing niche yet beloved competitive games.\n2. **Pipeline Talent Issue:** In League of Legends, for example, many believe that talent for certain role players from North America is extremely poor, and top teams often take bets on unproven imports from other regions over training and cultivating talent stateside. This issue is exacerbated by Twitch in its own interesting way: Becoming a pro player is simply harder to do and becoming a top tier steamer is both more monetarily rewarding and easier (subjective) to achieve, pushing talented players into streaming. Adding other community validated tournaments will smooth the difficulty (and monetization) curve, reducing the amount of players who either quit, stream only, or switch into other esports, and make the North American LCS more competitive. As an aside, I am writing this piece on October 9th, and currently the North American teams are doing abysmally in the World Championship.\n3. **Allow Creators to Engage with Audience Directly:** Creators are given new options to interact and communicate with their fans, ranging from hosting friendly super fan tournaments to dueling another creator using the fanbase as the fighting squad. This allows fans to become pseudo creators and gives new ways for creators to reward long term fans.\n4. **New Categories And Niches Emerge:** The “Tournaments As A Service” feature will bring down the costs and activation energy required for someone not well versed in operations to run a streamlined tournament, and I personally cannot wait to see the new types of game modes and ways creators push this tool to the limit. Just go off the top of my head, I can imagine everything from rap battles, cook offs, dance battles, slam poetry, coding competitions, and more. The common trend amongst all the things that get me jazzed is the non gaming nature of it. Twitch can really take a note from the original Justin.tv vision for a web based reality TV show and allow the physical world of competition and the digital audience to meld together to create something entirely authentic.\n\n## Thanks For Reading", "timestamp": 1633454620, "digest": "w7uU2COMoR6a91HHKBz0CO0ERqrW0ltz6YCrnto6x8w", "contributor": "0x7fD8f6B669964D217aed9B325aB5Fc1c3Ca2E249"}

Proper implementation of TaaS will spread the concentration of esports away from big western markets and large game developers towards individual content creators playing niche yet beloved competitive games.\n2. **Pipeline Talent Issue:** In League of Legends, for example, many believe that talent for certain role players from North America is extremely poor, and top teams often take bets on unproven imports from other regions over training and cultivating talent stateside. This issue is exacerbated by Twitch in its own interesting way: Becoming a pro player is simply harder to do and becoming a top tier steamer is both more monetarily rewarding and easier (subjective) to achieve, pushing talented players into streaming. Adding other community validated tournaments will smooth the difficulty (and monetization) curve, reducing the amount of players who either quit, stream only, or switch into other esports, and make the North American LCS more competitive. As an aside, I am writing this piece on October 9th, and currently the North American teams are doing abysmally in the World Championship.\n3. **Allow Creators to Engage with Audience Directly:** Creators are given new options to interact and communicate with their fans, ranging from hosting friendly super fan tournaments to dueling another creator using the fanbase as the fighting squad. This allows fans to become pseudo creators and gives new ways for creators to reward long term fans.\n4. **New Categories And Niches Emerge:** The “Tournaments As A Service” feature will bring down the costs and activation energy required for someone not well versed in operations to run a streamlined tournament, and I personally cannot wait to see the new types of game modes and ways creators push this tool to the limit. Just go off the top of my head, I can imagine everything from rap battles, cook offs, dance battles, slam poetry, coding competitions, and more. The common trend amongst all the things that get me jazzed is the non gaming nature of it. Twitch can really take a note from the original Justin.tv vision for a web based reality TV show and allow the physical world of competition and the digital audience to meld together to create something entirely authentic.\n\n## Thanks For Reading", "timestamp": 1633454630, "digest": "uTpTbyoa9IKYxD3SvII1Vfxe1Cg9NZmgIeX2AyX0HA4", "contributor": "0x7fD8f6B669964D217aed9B325aB5Fc1c3Ca2E249"}

What a time to be alive. \n\nWelcome to Student of The Game, written by [Kanan Rengaraju](https://twitter.com/KananRengaraju). Weather is starting to cool in Southern California, and I can’t wait to channel the fear of the pandemic never ending into writing insightful pieces. SoTG was spun up to explore the future of leisure and how society will view concepts like rest, play, and time off. I hope to loosely stick to this theme, and explore niches and ideas that pique my interest, and I hope we can all learn something along the way.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd52d126-fbbc-4e89-984f-c9b8a95769ae_1280x686.jpeg)\n\nTwitch, the preeminent online live streaming platform, is releasing “[Twitch Versus](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2020/09/09/versus-by-twitch-closed-beta-9-8-20/),” a set of tools and features that will allow content creators to host competitions on the platform. Creators will soon build monetizable competitions and engage with their audiences in new ways. I believe that Twitch Versus is the first step in the direction of a “Tournaments as a Service” model that other companies and startups will adopt, and this will fundamentally create a new type of marketplace economy.\n\n## Introduction - Broadcast Systems and Esports\n\nTwitch is a live streaming platform focused on gaming and esports that has slowly grown into new niches like live music production, cooking, and interviews. Content creators have the ability to produce content, find an audience through the recommendation systems, and monetize all within the platform, making Twitch the most viable platform to build an audience and income. Likewise, esports has found a home on Twitch for the exact same reasons. Youtube also has a subsection of live streaming esports content, but the bulk of its value comes as a store for videos on demand (VODs) and the strength of its recommendation systems.\n\n## Two Previous Successfully Run Creator Tournaments\n\nNinja, one of the most prominent live streamers on Twitch, was paid purportedly $30 million to switch to another streaming service, Mixer, only for it to shut down after a few months. While Ninja was paid very handsomely, the most interesting aspect of the deal to me was Ninja Battles, a weekly cash pool tournament he attached his brand to on Mixer in which players and streamers competed in. The entire tournament was the first of its kind, professionally casted, and presumably bankrolled by Mixer as a way to bring more views to the nascent platform. My understanding is that Mixer took a two pronged approach for signing Ninja: signing a top tier content creator with both the casual streaming audience and professional integrity to be attached to a tournament. Unfortunately, Mixer was shut down before any real growth could be witnessed, but one can’t help but wonder about what could happen if a creator were to host a tournament all on his or her own...\n\nEnter the Tyler1 Championship (TCS), hosted by the infamous Tyler1, a League of Legends streamer, competitor, and commentator who has had many documented bouts of toxicity and lack of integrity. Tyler1 turned over a new leaf, channelling his over the top personality into hilarious and insightful streams, and created the most successful unofficial League of Legends tournament, even eclipsing the Academy League in many eyes.\n\n> Tyler1 being in his element and being the natural entertainer he is for the TCS Grand Finals.\n\nThe North American League of Legends competitive scene is centered around the League of Legends Championship Series (LCS) and, to a lesser extent, the Academy League, but doesn't provide enough competitive experience outside of those two leagues. The TCS provided that gray space between professional and amateur players, allowing players to compete on a semi-professional level with the audience of a regular tournament. Most of the audience was there for Tyler1 himself, who commentated the entire tournament with a variety of skits, costumes, and backgrounds to suit his zany style, cementing the belief that creator tournaments can be successful.\n\n## “Tournaments As A Service”\n\nNinja Battles and the TCS both share a creator driven model, and there is more than enough proof to show that this is a viable model. Enter Twitch Versus and what I dub as “Tournaments as a Service”. The thesis is that a creator has enough cachet and knowledge in a game to bring an audience and other players to a tournament, and this concentration will attract sponsorships. The four main components are the Creator, who sets the format, style, and duration of the competition, the Competitors, seeking cash prizes, notoriety, and social media clout, Sponsors, who see a marketing and branding opportunity, and the Audience, brought in through loyalty for competitors, creator, or for the sheer spectacle of competition. This 4 sided marketplace only exists in the abstract right now, and if Twitch or any other company can implement this idea, creators will gain another to monetize and drive value to their audiences.\n\n> Ninja playing Fortnite with Chicago rapper, Lil Durk, goes to show how large Ninja’s influence is on media.\n\nAs mentioned, Twitch Versus is just the first attempt at TaaS, and doesn’t include any monetization paths yet. Some questions I have going forward are: will streaming companies such as Twitch be able to take a cut of the total raised sponsorship money as a percentage on top of the Stripe processor? Will ad revenue be split between creators and platforms? Can platforms allow audiences to crowdsource the prize pool themselves, adding even more engagement and support from the audience? All of these questions and more will be answered in the upcoming years, and I am incredibly excited to see how TaaS matures.\n\nI want to leave the readers with 4 more concrete ideas about how TaaS will add to the Passion Economy.\n\n1. **Decentralize The Tournament Structure:** I touched on this topic briefly in the big about the TCS; most Esports tournaments are conducted by game developers, who have to think about the bottom line and branding at all moments. This often leads to vibrant and thriving communities often being left out of the traditional esports scene as game developers prioritize bigger markets (think Global North / metropolitan areas). Proper implementation of TaaS will spread the concentration of esports away from big western markets and large game developers towards individual content creators playing niche yet beloved competitive games.\n2. **Pipeline Talent Issue:** In League of Legends, for example, many believe that talent for certain role players from North America is extremely poor, and top teams often take bets on unproven imports from other regions over training and cultivating talent stateside. This issue is exacerbated by Twitch in its own interesting way: Becoming a pro player is simply harder to do and becoming a top tier steamer is both more monetarily rewarding and easier (subjective) to achieve, pushing talented players into streaming. Adding other community validated tournaments will smooth the difficulty (and monetization) curve, reducing the amount of players who either quit, stream only, or switch into other esports, and make the North American LCS more competitive. As an aside, I am writing this piece on October 9th, and currently the North American teams are doing abysmally in the World Championship.\n3. **Allow Creators to Engage with Audience Directly:** Creators are given new options to interact and communicate with their fans, ranging from hosting friendly super fan tournaments to dueling another creator using the fanbase as the fighting squad.

Just go off the top of my head, I can imagine everything from rap battles, cook offs, dance battles, slam poetry, coding competitions, and more. The common trend amongst all the things that get me jazzed is the non gaming nature of it. Twitch can really take a note from the original Justin.tv vision for a web based reality TV show and allow the physical world of competition and the digital audience to meld together to create something entirely authentic.\n\n## Thanks For Reading", "timestamp": 1633454639, "digest": "fPzBE3pcLdSFdfHf8td5r3K71WsKSuYiDxXTlW-2wYU", "contributor": "0x7fD8f6B669964D217aed9B325aB5Fc1c3Ca2E249"}

Just left my Web2 dev job of five years and jumped down the rabbit hole into Web3 and crypto. What did I do next to prepare for this brave new world? I built some Loot derivatives :P\n\nAfter several attempts that didn’t work out, disappointment started to set in. Before it could take a hold of me, I shook it off and used it as a catalyst towards my next project. That’s where Realm comes in.\n\n# What is Realm?\n\nRealm is inspired by turn based games where you **collect**, **build**, **explore**, **trade** and **fight** your way to victory. But what does winning look like? More on that later.\n\nYou’ll start out by minting and naming your Realm NFT. Rarity is found in the geographical features that each Realm holds. From volcanos to coral reefs, each feature will provide your Realm with unique bonuses and interactions.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nOnce you’ve minted a Realm you’re ready to start building! Build up your cities and work on growing your resources. Improve your Realm by researching through various tech trees.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe game keeps track of a handful of key metrics that provide you with the resources to advance. All of these metrics are associated with your unique Realm NFT.\n\n**Resources**\n\nThere are many ways to collect resources. Two fundamental ways will be through farming and mining. Each of these methods will yield 6–8 different types of resources that in turn help improve your Realm’s metrics and also provide goods to trade with.\n\n**Building**\n\nYou’ll start out by building a city and eventually evolve into a multi-city Realm. Farms and mines will help you get off the ground. As the game evolves you’ll be able to build learning centers, government headquarters and military facilities, to name a few. The list of possible expansions is up to us.\n\n**Units**\n\nCreate explorer units to better your odds at finding Artifacts, Lore and Loot in your Realm. You will have a higher likelihood at find a specific type depending on the units you create.\n\nBuild up your army. There are NPCs in your Realm that will test your borders.\n\n**Advancements**\n\nFollow the path of advancement through a technology and society tree. You choose which path your Realm takes.\n\nDecide what type of government you’d like to explore and gain bonuses based on your choices.\n\n**Achievements**\n\nWho doesn’t like achievements! As you progress, collect achievements for a variety of goals. Rarity of these achievements depend on the rigor required to get them.\n\n**Inter-Realm Play**\n\nYour Realm is not an island. You can decide to be peaceful with your neighbors or declare war. To each their own.\n\n**Collectables**\n\nIn the end, immortalize what you’ve accomplished by minting collectible NFTs based on your gameplay.\n\n# What is the End Game?\n\nWinning can be many things in Realm. Are you trying to build the greatest trading Realm ever? Do you want to collect as many Lore/Artifacts NFTs as you can find? Do you want to build a great army and fight against other Realms?\n\nYou can achieve all of them if you want. And these are just the start. I’d love to see people in the community get involved and build more and more scenarios.\n\n# Lego blocks for the Community\n\nCommunity first. The only path to success is through community. A way to achieve that is to provide lego blocks that others can use, remix and improve upon. There is no Realm without you.\n\nAll data is held in public variables and is accessible by other contracts. Usage of metrics and resources is limited to the Realm owner and approved addresses. That means you can create expansions and experiences on top of Realm data.\n\n# Long Term Vision\n\nA Big part of Realm centers around three things:\n\n1. **Building Community** through gaming\n2. **Creating ownership** for those engaged\n3. Providing **Real World Value**\n\nAs I’ve stepped into the crypto world I’ve seen the power of openness and collaboration like never before. I’d like to bring that same spirit to Realm.

Just left my Web2 dev job of five years and jumped down the rabbit hole into Web3 and crypto. What did I do next to prepare for this brave new world? I built some Loot derivatives :P\n\nAfter several attempts that didn’t work out, disappointment started to set in. Before it could take a hold of me, I shook it off and used it as a catalyst towards my next project. That’s where Realm comes in.\n\n# What is Realm?\n\nRealm is inspired by turn based games where you **collect**, **build**, **explore**, **trade** and **fight** your way to victory. But what does winning look like? More on that later.\n\nYou’ll start out by minting and naming your Realm NFT. Rarity is found in the geographical features that each Realm holds. From volcanos to coral reefs, each feature will provide your Realm with unique bonuses and interactions.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nOnce you’ve minted a Realm you’re ready to start building! Build up your cities and work on growing your resources. Improve your Realm by researching through various tech trees.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe game keeps track of a handful of key metrics that provide you with the resources to advance. All of these metrics are associated with your unique Realm NFT.\n\n**Resources**\n\nThere are many ways to collect resources. Two fundamental ways will be through farming and mining. Each of these methods will yield 6–8 different types of resources that in turn help improve your Realm’s metrics and also provide goods to trade with.\n\n**Building**\n\nYou’ll start out by building a city and eventually evolve into a multi-city Realm. Farms and mines will help you get off the ground. As the game evolves you’ll be able to build learning centers, government headquarters and military facilities, to name a few. The list of possible expansions is up to us.\n\n**Units**\n\nCreate explorer units to better your odds at finding Artifacts, Lore and Loot in your Realm. You will have a higher likelihood at find a specific type depending on the units you create.\n\nBuild up your army. There are NPCs in your Realm that will test your borders.\n\n**Advancements**\n\nFollow the path of advancement through a technology and society tree. You choose which path your Realm takes.\n\nDecide what type of government you’d like to explore and gain bonuses based on your choices.\n\n**Achievements**\n\nWho doesn’t like achievements! As you progress, collect achievements for a variety of goals. Rarity of these achievements depend on the rigor required to get them.\n\n**Inter-Realm Play**\n\nYour Realm is not an island. You can decide to be peaceful with your neighbors or declare war. To each their own.\n\n**Collectables**\n\nIn the end, immortalize what you’ve accomplished by minting collectible NFTs based on your gameplay.\n\n# What is the End Game?\n\nWinning can be many things in Realm. Are you trying to build the greatest trading Realm ever? Do you want to collect as many Lore/Artifacts NFTs as you can find? Do you want to build a great army and fight against other Realms?\n\nYou can achieve all of them if you want. And these are just the start. I’d love to see people in the community get involved and build more and more scenarios.\n\n# Lego blocks for the Community\n\nCommunity first. The only path to success is through community. A way to achieve that is to provide lego blocks that others can use, remix and improve upon. There is no Realm without you.\n\nAll data is held in public variables and is accessible by other contracts. Usage of metrics and resources is limited to the Realm owner and approved addresses. That means you can create expansions and experiences on top of Realm data.\n\n# Long Term Vision\n\nA Big part of Realm centers around three things:\n\n1. **Building Community** through gaming\n2. **Creating ownership** for those engaged\n3. Providing **Real World Value**\n\nAs I’ve stepped into the crypto world I’ve seen the power of openness and collaboration like never before. I’d like to bring that same spirit to Realm. Though Realm is just a game, I hope it can bring people together and provide a collective experience that is fun for all.\n\n# Contracts\n\nYou can find the Realm contract here: <https://arbiscan.io/address/0x4de95c1E202102E22E801590C51D7B979f167FBB>\n\nCode: <https://github.com/jona/realm>\n\nI’ll be adding the base layer contracts in the coming week.\n\n# Want to get involved?\n\nCome join our discord: <https://discord.gg/w3UzXdvvb9>\n\nFeel free to DM me on twitter with any questions, feedback, comments :)", "timestamp": 1633454823, "digest": "JHvLB4RSEdrNCjdE_5FIssMgsXHSKjBrGNENjH6qFFs", "contributor": "0xC18D03a8Be67cb08c01434861Dc561a70c4b3aA8"}

Their usage across most of these industries has been around for many years, it’s only now that they’ve reached mainstream adoption.\n\nIn March 2021, the NFT/Collectibles marketplace had a market cap of $20B.\n\n![nft market cap](https://blog.paperchain.io/img/Screen_Shot_2021-08-11_at_2.49.00_PM.png)\n\nSource: [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/youngjoseph/2021/03/29/nft-market-rages-on-nfts-market-cap-grow-1785-in-2021-as-demand-explodes/?sh=4dc3233c7fdc)\n\nOpenSea has already passed $600M in sales volume in August (as of August 11, 2021).\n\n![opensea volume](https://blog.paperchain.io/img/Screen_Shot_2021-08-11_at_2.50.44_PM.png)\n\nSource: [Dune Analytics](https://dune.xyz/queries/3469/6913)\n\n## Internet of Money\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) arrived in the collective conscious on the back of Ethereum’s smart contract system and it’s ability to replicate or disrupt existing financial systems in a self-executing and self-governing way.\n\n$80B is now locked in DeFi protocols on the Ethereum blockchain ($40B increase from Mar 2021).\n\n![defi tvl](https://blog.paperchain.io/img/Screen_Shot_2021-08-11_at_3.03.58_PM.png)\n\nSource: [DeFi Pulse](https://defipulse.com/)\n\nDeFi is reaching an inflection point as it grows beyond crypto-native assets. MakerDAO just passed four new proposals to increase their debt ceiling for real world assets (RWAs) to [$40M](https://coinquora.com/centrifuge-and-makerdao-bring-real-world-assets-to-defi/).\n\nPaperchain is one of the first [RWAs to be accepted in the MakerDAO](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/67675/makerdao-community-vote-real-world-assets) debt pools.\n\nThis move continues the connection of DeFi to trillions of dollars in assets in the real world.\n\nThe creator economy stands as one of the benefits of this connection.\n\n## Paperchain = content 🤝 money\n\nWe talk ***a lot*** about what Paperchain is.\n\n[https://twitter.com/paperchainio/status/1413562910857703426](https://twitter.com/paperchainio/status/1413562910857703426)\n\nAn instant payments card for creators.

NFTs are programmable collateral that creates an interdependent creator economy.\n\n![paperchain product map](https://blog.paperchain.io/img/Screen_Shot_2021-08-11_at_4.07.26_PM.png)\n\nThis means instant payments for online content.

{"id": "RzfOSjjMpQtx4sAEsXXW8NN3Q-G9i_9ZzVNOww_TqUo", "title": "Analogizing & Valuing Cryptocurrencies", "body": "(Originally published on Medium on June 22, 2021)\n\nEach token is extremely different from the next in both function and tokenomics, which is part of the reason why valuing and comping each is so difficult. Moreover, the structure/architecture of each cryptocurrency is not exactly like anything we’ve seen before, but there are some similarities to elements we have today in our IRL world. The way I see it,\\*\\* cryptocurrencies can be analogized/divided into different categories including (but not limited to): commodities, foreign currencies, and stocks.\\*\\*\n\n1\\. **Commodities.** Everyone’s heard of the analogy that Bitcoin is like “digital gold”. There’s a finite supply; you need to invest capex (CPU) and spend resources (electricity/bandwidth) to mine it; its purpose is to hold value and allow you to pay for things, but it is pretty difficult to transact in (takes 15–20 minutes to validate a transaction). All of this is just like regular gold (in society today, you could theoretically exchange gold for a good/service/fiat — just need to find a counterparty that accepts it). One wrinkle in this analogy is the “Layer 2” Lightning Network. Like I said, crypto isn’t exactly like anything we’ve seen before, but still “digital gold” is the best analogy there is thus far for BTC.\n\nTherefore, many Bitcoin bulls think BTC will one day reach gold’s current market cap (\\~$11T), which would equate to a fully diluted PT of \\~$525k. Nevertheless, since it is a commodity whose sole purpose is to hold value, BTC will be valued and trade based on sentiment (the adoption of BTC as a form of payment/value and its continuing ability be transferred from peer to peer). As more countries and companies start to adopt BTC, the value of it will increase; and the same is true vice versa.\n\n2\\. **Foreign currencies.** Some people liken ETH to a consumable commodity, but I would actually describe Ethereum more as a foreign land/country with ETH as its currency. Ethereum has a different purpose than Bitcoin and that is to enable smart contracts. As such, there are so many cool things being built on Ethereum ranging from decentralized exchanges to virtual worlds like ZED (digital horse racing) & Decentraland — much like how these things could be built and exist in another country.\n\nIn this analogy, I view gas fees as taxes. Users pay these taxes so that the network can validate the users’ transactions. The network (somewhat like a government for this “foreign country” — and yes, there’s voting too!) uses these gas fees to pay miners (in proof-of-work networks) / validators (in proof-of-stake networks), much like how governments pay workers/companies/organizations to keep society running. There’s a saying that the true test of currency is if you can pay taxes with it.\n\nSo in the case of smart contract networks like Ethereum, Polkadot, Solana, & Cardano, the value shouldn’t be determined based on fees (“taxes”) generated, but rather it should be determined based on the “GDP” of the “country” and the value of the things being built on it. The more appealing and useful the products/applications are, the more the currency (e.g., ETH) will be worth. However, in this analogy, I’m not sure what some L2 scaling solutions (like Polygon aka MATIC) would be considered as. Perhaps they’re like futuristic, societal international space stations where different “foreign countries” can connect to since Polygon does seek to be an “internet of blockchains” to scale/connect several blockchains.\n\nMoreover, on a personal note, I would like to see more things on the networks be priced in their “native currencies” like ETH or MATIC. ZED’s digital race horses seemed to follow this trend at first (denominated prices of the horse in ETH instead of USD) up until their most recent horse drop. However, I’m not sure we will ever reach this point unless we physically live in a place whose government accepts crypto as legal tender. A person will always denominate things to the currency that he/she/they can purchase food/shelter with.\n\n3\\. **Stocks.** Several tokens are actually like stocks, whether it’s through financial interest or governance (voting) rights or both. As such, your typical valuation metrics can apply like P/E ratios, dividend yield, etc. For example, QUICK (the token for QuickSwap DEX), pays a dividend that reinvests itself. QuickSwap uses 0.04% of the trading volume (collected from the 0.3% fee it charges per trade) to purchase QUICK tokens in the open market and distributes those tokens to QUICK holders staking their tokens. At the time of writing this (evening ET of 6/21/21), the last 24 hour trading volume on QuickSwap was \\~$256.6mm, making the rewards to QUICK stakers over $102k. With 135k QUICK tokens staked with a \\~$500 token price, the APR is currently 55% based on 6/21/21 prices and last 24 hrs of volume. Not a bad return (that gets paid throughout the day) assuming the DEX does not collapse.\n\nOn the other hand, UniSwap’s token (UNI) currently only allows the tokenholder to participate in voting/governance issues, but has a “switch” that will turn on fees to tokenholders at a later decided date. Therefore, tokenholders are paying for the right to vote on UniSwap decisions and a TBD future dividend.\n\n\n---\n\nAs I said earlier, the function and tokenomics of different cryptocurrencies are unlike anything we’ve seen before. There are obviously other categories like stablecoins that I did not touch on in this article. While there are similarities to things in our world today and I try to make those comparisons, the dynamics are still a bit different; and it will be extremely interesting to see how the world reacts to it.\n\n***Disclaimer:*** *At the time of publishing (6/22/21), I have long positions in BTC, ETH, MATIC, DOT, SOL, and QUICK.

{"id": "vfU9T4Nc0n1kDqx3g09_7CHjiUvGLQPOHHebh0ghb28", "title": "Chapter One: A Man Called Dove", "body": "The solver watched a tall woman hurry down the street. She had blonde hair, and she wore a black coat that billowed around a white dress. Her heels were polished black—the kind the girls wore in the darker places of Junction. Blues and pinks reflected off them and it looked like she was dancing in the rain that hadn’t stopped pouring for a week.\n\nHe sniffed. Sulphur floated in the air and masked the stink of a world gone mad, filled with people who had forgotten themselves, lost in the luxury of light and plenty. There were no more stop signs, no more forks in the road. Desire had become linear, and the path to absolution was paved neon.\n\n“She’s different.” Mai’s voice infiltrated the solver’s thoughts.\n\n“Track her,” said the solver, tapping again at the cylindrical lenses sticking forward from his head. His goggles were special to him. He’d earned them on the Arch, long ago, as a reward for being who he was—who he’d become. Solvers were honed and dangerous. They were weapons made by new men from the ashes of the old world, and he was among the oldest and most dangerous. But also the most tortured. The program had left no visible scars, but they were there, and they were as earned as his vision.\n\nWhere was the woman going? He raised a green-gloved hand to his face and adjusted a lens, spiralling it between nimble fingers, grooves of the lens rippling the soft plastic of his glove.\n\nThe image of the mid-town market shifted; the opaque became clear and the hidden became seen. The woman kept flicking her feet, faster now, purposeful. \n\n“She’s headed to Chunda House,” said Mai inside his head. His Core had found a pattern and crunched the numbers. The solver checked the girl’s direction and made some estimations of his own, then grunted. Chunda House, he wondered. Going to see the Cybs, probably.\n\nThe Cybs were a blight. They were a collection of drugged-up augments who lived only for the next hit—a metaphor for what life had become. During the Reckoning, in that split-second of confusion when Providence had impossibly gone offline—when the city became bathed in darkness and its guardians had gone blind—the Cybs had seized their chance to infect far and wide. They took territory and spread their “religion.” No doubt the girls in the black heels were already paying their dues to their new digital pimps. The tall woman was likely no different. But...\n\n“It feels wrong,” he said.\n\nMai buzzed in his mind. “Maybe it’s just your nanos messing with your head again, Dove.”\n\n“It’s not my fucking nanos.”\n\n“Easy, tiger.”\n\nDove didn’t respond. His Core was right, of course. She was always right. Every day, Dove burned. Every damned day. His creation had been a sin. In all of the Illumination’s glory, while revelling in their brilliance, they hadn’t considered an expiry date, or a shelf-life. Solvers like Dove—old, weary—needed refurbishment often. Too long in the field without care or attention, and they’d suffer silently. Sometimes loudly.\n\nThe Illumination’s agent of light who had delivered Dove’s current instructions had been certain: find Maxine. But Dove doubted a Junction hooker would be the key to finding the Passport and bringing order back to the City, still teetering on the brink of collapse in the wake of the Reckoning. It wouldn’t bring Providence back online. What did the Illumination want with Maxine, he wondered?\n\n“The girl is working with the Cybs, Dove—still think this is a waste of time?” Mai asked.\n\n“Maybe,” he said.\n\nBut he knew better than to second guess his source. Everything led somewhere; everyone wanted something. It’d been two weeks since the Reckoning, and the City had grown darker and more dangerous. Someone had wanted it that way, and Dove would find out why and who. Not for the Illumination, who had commanded his obedience, but for himself. Do this, he had thought, and perhaps he’d earn his freedom.\n\nThe uneasy pact he’d made with the Illumination had led him here, to this back alley in the dregs of the City, watching a girl with black heels scurry into a cartel hole. He followed.\n\nGetting inside wasn’t difficult, despite the gatekeeper. Cybs were small minded, their pride was misplaced, and they were sure in their superiority. Sure, they’d heard of the hack Dove now sent scurrying through the gatekeeper’s neural net, but they did not believe. Military men taking over their implants? Absurd. He flicked his eyes and a series of menus opened. He saw the conjured strings of code within, and he accessed the nanos floating about the bouncer’s brainstem. It took seconds, maybe less. The idiots were still using tech developed in the dawn of the Singularity. It was archaic—slow and clunky. Easy for a solver.\n\nThe doors to Chunda House opened to him and its taint declared itself like a crashing train. Music used to mean something. Now the streets were filled with disconnected tones and beats, waves laced with synth and vibe in sync with the always flickering halogen of the night. It was worse inside—in your face, inescapable, forcing you to recognize its power. The dancers matched the music: thugs with metal limbs and teeth, inhuman faces carved from steel, draped in the finest silk, lugging behind them girls with black heels and other creatures of the night. Everyone drank, liquids thick and thin, blue and red and yellow, each capable of making one forget, or become someone else. Even for a night.\n\n*Not sure why the Cybs bother*, he thought. Their nanos scrubbed it all up before it could take hold of their blood.\n\nThere. The tall woman sat in the corner alone, a bottle of something blue before her on a table shaped  like a flower, each pedal sharp and cold. The solver adjusted his vision, scoped Maxine’s face, and saw the red puffiness of her eyes and cheeks glistening sodium and hate. He pulled at his green glove, snapped it against his wrist, then clenched his teeth. A tick; a tell. A habit he couldn’t stop no matter how stupid it made him, or how weak. A vestige of a former life, all but forgotten. But still with him.\n\nMaxine. The Illumination kept detailed files on targets of interest—so deep that a childhood seemed just another word on a page, chapters of lives running on forever. Her full name was Maxine de L’avant, and she was a True Worlder. Not an original, of course, but descended from pre-singularity lines. Her family name made her wealthy, so why had she decided to waste away in Junction, turning tricks for the Disconnected, and now in the service of Cybs? The question had bothered him since he’d left the Arch.\n\nDrunks and gangsters swept aside before him, desperate to avoid his attention and the shuffle of his black cloak as he pointed his way across the bar to where Maxine sat. Some knew him, sure, and some didn’t; but even those blissfully ignorant sensed him. The night-girl saw him come but did not recoil, wide eyes fixed on his face. He imagined the horror she saw: a square jaw, stubble, and lids for eyes failing to hide the rage within. Maxine dangled a glass from thin fingers, tipped white. She held a pinky to her lips, also white, like her dress. Black and white, Maxine. If it were only so simple.\n\nHe slipped into her booth, rested his arms on the table and clasped his hands. No fear, just curiosity. She didn’t seem to know who he was, or what he was. In the strobing light of the bar, her face pulsed rapidly and his vision corrected to create a full image. She was young, but not too young. A crack at her lips, in her foundation, and a crease in her temple. The way the joints of her knuckles protruded a bit too much, or how she sat back, relaxed, poised. The environment coalesced around her until she was the pinpoint, she was the energy, a beacon in a white dress. What was she doing in a place like this?\n\n“I’ve been looking for you, Maxine.”\n\nShe sipped, and a trickle of blue seeped from the corners of her lips. She caught it with her pinky, licked it off, stared at him with eyeballs round and shining.\n\n“You found me, mystery man.”\n\n“The Cybs?” asked Dove.\n\n“They keep me safe,” she said.\n\n“Is it worth the price?”\n\nShe turned away, brushed her hair with a hand, and rested her elbow on the hard steel top of the booth. He saw it just then—a hesitation. Brief, but real. She was scarred, too. The kind of scars that went unseen except to those who looked.\n\n“Maybe it is. Doesn’t matter. You want a drink?”\n\n“No.” He snapped his glove.\n\n“Fine by me,” she said. Refill. The bottle was almost gone, now. That would have been too much for her alone; someone had come and gone and left her in tears—despondent. Or maybe this was her, all of her, in the flesh. Maxine de L'avant, black heels and all.\n\n“Do you have it?” he asked.\n\nShe paused mid-sip, let the cocktail roll on her tongue and gulped it down. It was enough—confirmation. The agent’s direction to Maxine had been sound, and his information was reliable. The solver’s answers started here.\n\n“I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about, stranger. What did you say your name was?”\n\n“I didn’t.”\n\nHer eyes were focused now, no longer hazy, and she sat straighter. A delicate hand wiped away the last of her dried tears. She sniffed.\n\n“No, I guess you didn’t. Doesn’t take an Elite to figure it out though, where you come from, I mean. That cloak, those eyes, if you can call them that. You’re a solver, aren’t you?”\n\nSo, he thought. She did know what he was.\n\n“Shit,” she continued. “Never thought I’d meet one. Didn’t think they—you—were a real thing, you know? One of those legends that runs through the circuits, a myth of our cybernetic reality, an echo of light and electricity. Who can tell any more what’s real and what’s not. Do you remember? Before, I mean? Life pre-singularity. You should have seen it, solver, it was so beautiful. Green, everywhere—green like your gloves. Fresh air. Quiet. I remember.”\n\n“You’d have been a child, at best,” he said.\n\n“I said I remember, ok?” Curt. Tense. Painful. Odd for a True Worlder, but perhaps not for a girl lost in Junction. He was intrigued, but her story didn’t matter. His story mattered.\n\n“Tell me where it is, Maxine.”\n\nShe grew restless, crossed her legs back and forth, then her arms, then finished the bottle of something blue. Synthwaves continued to ripple around them, the beat grew faster, and she nodded her head in sync, gaze fixed on his face. She bit her lip.\n\n“I don’t have it. Not any more,” she said.\n\n“Where?”\n\nShe bit harder, pushed against the seat, and strained against herself until she almost gave in. Almost.\n\n“Protect me, promise me you’ll protect me.” She was pleading. Her voice trembled.\n\nDove did not flinch, but he pursed his lips. He had made promises once. They broke, and people died. He was blamed. By himself, and others. The struggle had been beaten out of him on the Arch. The Illumination had been unwilling to endure such a fault.\n\n“I don’t make promises,” he said.\n\nShe cried—silently, slowly. Streaks ran down her cheek, tracing the same lines in her makeup like rainwater in a gutter. Trapped, but she knew what she must do.\n\n“It’s with Arcturus.”\n\n“Arcturus? The moonlight man?” he asked.\n\n“You heard me.”\n\n“What were you doing in Osiron?”\n\n“Too many questions.” She sniffed her last and regained her composure. He couldn’t touch her now—not any more. “Now, I think I’ll refill my bottle, and then I’m going to go dance with my shiny friends. You can join us, you know.”\n\nThe hint of her smile was seductive—back at work. He felt so sad for her. She was grace-fallen, a True Worlder no more. He gave no reply, for none was needed.

She had blonde hair, and she wore a black coat that billowed around a white dress. Her heels were polished black—the kind the girls wore in the darker places of Junction. Blues and pinks reflected off them and it looked like she was dancing in the rain that hadn’t stopped pouring for a week.\n\nHe sniffed. Sulphur floated in the air and masked the stink of a world gone mad, filled with people who had forgotten themselves, lost in the luxury of light and plenty. There were no more stop signs, no more forks in the road. Desire had become linear, and the path to absolution was paved neon.\n\n“She’s different.” Mai’s voice infiltrated the solver’s thoughts.\n\n“Track her,” said the solver, tapping again at the cylindrical lenses sticking forward from his head. His goggles were special to him. He’d earned them on the Arch, long ago, as a reward for being who he was—who he’d become. Solvers were honed and dangerous. They were weapons made by new men from the ashes of the old world, and he was among the oldest and most dangerous. But also the most tortured. The program had left no visible scars, but they were there, and they were as earned as his vision.\n\nWhere was the woman going? He raised a green-gloved hand to his face and adjusted a lens, spiralling it between nimble fingers, grooves of the lens rippling the soft plastic of his glove.\n\nThe image of the mid-town market shifted; the opaque became clear and the hidden became seen. The woman kept flicking her feet, faster now, purposeful. \n\n“She’s headed to Chunda House,” said Mai inside his head. His Core had found a pattern and crunched the numbers. The solver checked the girl’s direction and made some estimations of his own, then grunted. Chunda House, he wondered. Going to see the Cybs, probably.\n\nThe Cybs were a blight. They were a collection of drugged-up augments who lived only for the next hit—a metaphor for what life had become. During the Reckoning, in that split-second of confusion when Providence had impossibly gone offline—when the city became bathed in darkness and its guardians had gone blind—the Cybs had seized their chance to infect far and wide. They took territory and spread their “religion.” No doubt the girls in the black heels were already paying their dues to their new digital pimps. The tall woman was likely no different. But...\n\n“It feels wrong,” he said.\n\nMai buzzed in his mind. “Maybe it’s just your nanos messing with your head again, Dove.”\n\n“It’s not my fucking nanos.”\n\n“Easy, tiger.”\n\nDove didn’t respond. His Core was right, of course. She was always right. Every day, Dove burned. Every damned day. His creation had been a sin. In all of the Illumination’s glory, while revelling in their brilliance, they hadn’t considered an expiry date, or a shelf-life. Solvers like Dove—old, weary—needed refurbishment often. Too long in the field without care or attention, and they’d suffer silently. Sometimes loudly.\n\nThe Illumination’s agent of light who had delivered Dove’s current instructions had been certain: find Maxine. But Dove doubted a Junction hooker would be the key to finding the Passport and bringing order back to the City, still teetering on the brink of collapse in the wake of the Reckoning. It wouldn’t bring Providence back online. What did the Illumination want with Maxine, he wondered?\n\n“The girl is working with the Cybs, Dove—still think this is a waste of time?” Mai asked.\n\n“Maybe,” he said.\n\nBut he knew better than to second guess his source. Everything led somewhere; everyone wanted something. It’d been two weeks since the Reckoning, and the City had grown darker and more dangerous. Someone had wanted it that way, and Dove would find out why and who. Not for the Illumination, who had commanded his obedience, but for himself. Do this, he had thought, and perhaps he’d earn his freedom.\n\nThe uneasy pact he’d made with the Illumination had led him here, to this back alley in the dregs of the City, watching a girl with black heels scurry into a cartel hole. He followed.\n\nGetting inside wasn’t difficult, despite the gatekeeper. Cybs were small minded, their pride was misplaced, and they were sure in their superiority. Sure, they’d heard of the hack Dove now sent scurrying through the gatekeeper’s neural net, but they did not believe. Military men taking over their implants? Absurd. He flicked his eyes and a series of menus opened. He saw the conjured strings of code within, and he accessed the nanos floating about the bouncer’s brainstem. It took seconds, maybe less. The idiots were still using tech developed in the dawn of the Singularity. It was archaic—slow and clunky. Easy for a solver.\n\nThe doors to Chunda House opened to him and its taint declared itself like a crashing train. Music used to mean something. Now the streets were filled with disconnected tones and beats, waves laced with synth and vibe in sync with the always flickering halogen of the night. It was worse inside—in your face, inescapable, forcing you to recognize its power. The dancers matched the music: thugs with metal limbs and teeth, inhuman faces carved from steel, draped in the finest silk, lugging behind them girls with black heels and other creatures of the night. Everyone drank, liquids thick and thin, blue and red and yellow, each capable of making one forget, or become someone else. Even for a night.\n\n*Not sure why the Cybs bother*, he thought. Their nanos scrubbed it all up before it could take hold of their blood.\n\nThere. The tall woman sat in the corner alone, a bottle of something blue before her on a table shaped  like a flower, each pedal sharp and cold. The solver adjusted his vision, scoped Maxine’s face, and saw the red puffiness of her eyes and cheeks glistening sodium and hate. He pulled at his green glove, snapped it against his wrist, then clenched his teeth. A tick; a tell. A habit he couldn’t stop no matter how stupid it made him, or how weak. A vestige of a former life, all but forgotten. But still with him.\n\nMaxine. The Illumination kept detailed files on targets of interest—so deep that a childhood seemed just another word on a page, chapters of lives running on forever. Her full name was Maxine de L’avant, and she was a True Worlder. Not an original, of course, but descended from pre-singularity lines. Her family name made her wealthy, so why had she decided to waste away in Junction, turning tricks for the Disconnected, and now in the service of Cybs? The question had bothered him since he’d left the Arch.\n\nDrunks and gangsters swept aside before him, desperate to avoid his attention and the shuffle of his black cloak as he pointed his way across the bar to where Maxine sat. Some knew him, sure, and some didn’t; but even those blissfully ignorant sensed him. The night-girl saw him come but did not recoil, wide eyes fixed on his face. He imagined the horror she saw: a square jaw, stubble, and lids for eyes failing to hide the rage within. Maxine dangled a glass from thin fingers, tipped white. She held a pinky to her lips, also white, like her dress. Black and white, Maxine. If it were only so simple.\n\nHe slipped into her booth, rested his arms on the table and clasped his hands. No fear, just curiosity. She didn’t seem to know who he was, or what he was. In the strobing light of the bar, her face pulsed rapidly and his vision corrected to create a full image. She was young, but not too young. A crack at her lips, in her foundation, and a crease in her temple. The way the joints of her knuckles protruded a bit too much, or how she sat back, relaxed, poised. The environment coalesced around her until she was the pinpoint, she was the energy, a beacon in a white dress. What was she doing in a place like this?\n\n“I’ve been looking for you, Maxine.”\n\nShe sipped, and a trickle of blue seeped from the corners of her lips. She caught it with her pinky, licked it off, stared at him with eyeballs round and shining.\n\n“You found me, mystery man.”\n\n“The Cybs?” asked Dove.\n\n“They keep me safe,” she said.\n\n“Is it worth the price?”\n\nShe turned away, brushed her hair with a hand, and rested her elbow on the hard steel top of the booth. He saw it just then—a hesitation. Brief, but real. She was scarred, too. The kind of scars that went unseen except to those who looked.\n\n“Maybe it is. Doesn’t matter. You want a drink?”\n\n“No.” He snapped his glove.\n\n“Fine by me,” she said. Refill. The bottle was almost gone, now. That would have been too much for her alone; someone had come and gone and left her in tears—despondent. Or maybe this was her, all of her, in the flesh. Maxine de L'avant, black heels and all.\n\n“Do you have it?” he asked.\n\nShe paused mid-sip, let the cocktail roll on her tongue and gulped it down. It was enough—confirmation. The agent’s direction to Maxine had been sound, and his information was reliable. The solver’s answers started here.\n\n“I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about, stranger. What did you say your name was?”\n\n“I didn’t.”\n\nHer eyes were focused now, no longer hazy, and she sat straighter. A delicate hand wiped away the last of her dried tears. She sniffed.\n\n“No, I guess you didn’t. Doesn’t take an Elite to figure it out though, where you come from, I mean. That cloak, those eyes, if you can call them that. You’re a solver, aren’t you?”\n\nSo, he thought. She did know what he was.\n\n“Shit,” she continued. “Never thought I’d meet one. Didn’t think they—you—were a real thing, you know? One of those legends that runs through the circuits, a myth of our cybernetic reality, an echo of light and electricity. Who can tell any more what’s real and what’s not. Do you remember? Before, I mean? Life pre-singularity. You should have seen it, solver, it was so beautiful. Green, everywhere—green like your gloves. Fresh air. Quiet. I remember.”\n\n“You’d have been a child, at best,” he said.\n\n“I said I remember, ok?” Curt. Tense. Painful. Odd for a True Worlder, but perhaps not for a girl lost in Junction. He was intrigued, but her story didn’t matter. His story mattered.\n\n“Tell me where it is, Maxine.”\n\nShe grew restless, crossed her legs back and forth, then her arms, then finished the bottle of something blue. Synthwaves continued to ripple around them, the beat grew faster, and she nodded her head in sync, gaze fixed on his face. She bit her lip.\n\n“I don’t have it. Not any more,” she said.\n\n“Where?”\n\nShe bit harder, pushed against the seat, and strained against herself until she almost gave in. Almost.\n\n“Protect me, promise me you’ll protect me.” She was pleading. Her voice trembled.\n\nDove did not flinch, but he pursed his lips. He had made promises once. They broke, and people died. He was blamed. By himself, and others. The struggle had been beaten out of him on the Arch. The Illumination had been unwilling to endure such a fault.\n\n“I don’t make promises,” he said.\n\nShe cried—silently, slowly. Streaks ran down her cheek, tracing the same lines in her makeup like rainwater in a gutter. Trapped, but she knew what she must do.\n\n“It’s with Arcturus.”\n\n“Arcturus? The moonlight man?” he asked.\n\n“You heard me.”\n\n“What were you doing in Osiron?”\n\n“Too many questions.” She sniffed her last and regained her composure. He couldn’t touch her now—not any more. “Now, I think I’ll refill my bottle, and then I’m going to go dance with my shiny friends. You can join us, you know.”\n\nThe hint of her smile was seductive—back at work. He felt so sad for her. She was grace-fallen, a True Worlder no more. He gave no reply, for none was needed.

His story mattered.\n\n“Tell me where it is, Maxine.”\n\nShe grew restless, crossed her legs back and forth, then her arms, then finished the bottle of something blue. Synthwaves continued to ripple around them, the beat grew faster, and she nodded her head in sync, gaze fixed on his face. She bit her lip.\n\n“I don’t have it. Not any more,” she said.\n\n“Where?”\n\nShe bit harder, pushed against the seat, and strained against herself until she almost gave in. Almost.\n\n“Protect me, promise me you’ll protect me.” She was pleading. Her voice trembled.\n\nDove did not flinch, but he pursed his lips. He had made promises once. They broke, and people died. He was blamed. By himself, and others. The struggle had been beaten out of him on the Arch. The Illumination had been unwilling to endure such a fault.\n\n“I don’t make promises,” he said.\n\nShe cried—silently, slowly. Streaks ran down her cheek, tracing the same lines in her makeup like rainwater in a gutter. Trapped, but she knew what she must do.\n\n“It’s with Arcturus.”\n\n“Arcturus? The moonlight man?” he asked.\n\n“You heard me.”\n\n“What were you doing in Osiron?”\n\n“Too many questions.” She sniffed her last and regained her composure. He couldn’t touch her now—not any more. “Now, I think I’ll refill my bottle, and then I’m going to go dance with my shiny friends. You can join us, you know.”\n\nThe hint of her smile was seductive—back at work. He felt so sad for her. She was grace-fallen, a True Worlder no more. He gave no reply, for none was needed. He picked himself up from the booth and raised a hand to his vision, captured a last memory of the Lady de L'avant, then made his way out, taking care not to drown in the filth of Chunda House.", "timestamp": 1633455244, "digest": "4r4OoEtKQA2ei0nDyJ9ujMksm8TKTRYNdkMMGIberMQ", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}

{"id": "S7czimXxaq2uaVug9_49l4XTVmV06IJ5qQd3lRe9Cpk", "title": "Realm: Game Mechanics Part 1", "body": "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*hcOLoGwxT_gz1zvbExbdNA.jpeg)\n\nWelcome to the first part in the series on Game Mechanics for Realm. We’ll begin with the basics.\n\n## Turns\n\nHow are turns interpreted into a blockchain game? A turn will default to 24 hours. Several actions will be available for the user that will essentially have a timer until it can be performed again.\n\n> For example, collection of resources from a mine or farm can only be completed every 24 hours.\n>\n> Note: This does not include the process of building structures as that is done via another mechanism. More details below.\n\n## Key Metrics\n\n### Gold\n\nThe currency of your Realm\n\n### Food\n\nControls population in your Realm. As your Food supply grows, your cities become more efficient at producing key metrics.\n\n### Workforce\n\nDrives how fast you can produce structures, units, etc. Detailed explanation can be found in the Building Time and Queue section.\n\n### Culture\n\nAccumulated to further the society tree.\n\n### Technology\n\nAccumulated to further the technology tree.\n\n### Religion\n\nAccumulated to further religion.\n\n### Reputation\n\nPositive interactions with other Realms.\n\n## Building Time and Queue\n\n### Build Time\n\nBuilding time various depending on what you are building.\n\n### Build Queue\n\nYou will start with a limit of 1 queue slot. As you increase your Workforce new queue slots will become available.\n\nEach additional slot will progressively require more points to unlock it\n\n> For example, if your workforce is at 25 points you will now have 2 queue slots open for construction. The next unlock will come at 37 points. The formula is `currentCheckpoint + (currentCheckpoint / 2)` . For the example above it would be `25 + (25 / 2)` .\n\nThere is an exception when it comes to building cities. More on that below.\n\n## Collection\n\nThere are two metrics that accrue each turn: \\n - Gold \\n - Religion\n\nYou’ll be able to collect these metrics every 24 hours.\n\n## **Basic structures**\n\n## City\n\nBuilding a city differs from the traditional way building works. It costs 50 Gold to build a city and has its own queue for building. Every time you build a city it will cost `BUILD_COST + (TOTAL_CITIES * 2)`. You can build a city every 24 hours.\n\nA city will yield:- Gold (4–8)- Workforce (4–8)- Culture (2–6)- Research (2–6)- Religion (2–6)\n\nAs your Food supply grows, you will get a bonus in each metric.\n\n## Farm\n\nA farm will yield Food ranging from 1–4. Collection of resources can occur every 24 hours.\n\nIn addition to Food, a farm has the possibility to yield a specific resource. Upon building, you will receive 100 + bonus (based on the Realm’s geographic features) towards one of the resources.\n\nThe resources yielded are picked from the list below. They are ordered from common to rarest: \\n - Wheat \\n - Corn \\n - Rice \\n - Honey \\n - Tea \\n - Coffee (+1 Culture) \\n - Chocolate (+1 Culture) \\n - Wine (+1 Culture)\n\nYou can build a farm every 12 hours.\n\n## Mine\n\nA mine will yield Workforce ranging from 1–4. Collection of resources can occur every 24 hours.\n\nIn addition to Workforce, a mine has the possibility to yield a specific resource. Upon building, you will receive 100 + bonus (based on the Realm’s geographic features) towards one of the resources.\n\nThe resources yielded are picked from the list below. They are ordered from common to rarest: \\n - Stone \\n - Copper \\n - Iron \\n - Coal \\n - Silver (+1 Gold) \\n - Aluminum (+1 Research) \\n - Lithium (+1 Research) \\n - Silicon (+1 Research)\n\nYou can build a mine every 12 hours.\n\n## Fishing Dock\n\nA dock will yield Food ranging from 1–4. Collection of resources can occur every 24 hours.\n\nIn addition to Food, a dock has the possibility to yield a specific resource. Upon building, you will receive 100 + bonus (based on the Realm’s geographic features) towards one of the resources.\n\nThe resources yielded are picked from the list below. They are ordered from common to rarest: \\n - Tuna \\n - Salmon \\n - Coral \\n - Oysters \\n - Manta Ray (+1 Research) \\n - Giant Squid (+1 Research)\n\nYou can build a dock every 12 hours.\n\n## Ranch\n\nA stable will yield Food ranging from 1–4. Collection of resources can occur every 24 hours.\n\nIn addition to Food, a stable has the possibility to yield a specific resource. Upon building, you will receive 100 + bonus (based on the Realm’s geographic features) towards one of the resources.\n\nThe resources yielded are picked from the list below. They are ordered from common to rarest: \\n - Chicken \\n - Pigs \\n - Llamas \\n - Donkeys (+1 Workforce) \\n - Cattle (+1 Workforce) \\n - Horses (+1 Workforce)\n\nYou can build a ranch every 12 hours.\n\n## Lumber Mill\n\nThis is a great way to gain Workforce. Every lumber mill yields +1 Workforce plus a bonus based on geographical features.\n\nYou can build a lumber mill every 12 hours.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis sets the foundation for the game. There’s a lot more to come. Next, it’s about improving your Realm and exploring what it has to offer.\n\nIn the next couple of articles I will introduce: \\n - City upgrades \\n - Units \\n - Exploration", "timestamp": 1633455365, "digest": "jhtvSltUyjNyNhTD-kmulsYkFn0XUOCSQt-h_otBr2g", "contributor": "0xC18D03a8Be67cb08c01434861Dc561a70c4b3aA8"}

Había que estar a la última.\n\nLos llenaron de publicidad. Una publicidad tan intrusiva que hasta costaba leer el contenido. Eso sí, le pusieron nombres molones: pop-up, pop-under, interstitial, trick banner, expanding ad…\n\nComo empezamos a enlazar al contenido en lugar de a la cabecera se quejaron del “deep linking” porque no veíamos toda la publicidad que querían que viéramos ni seguíamos el [camino que nos habían trazado](https://www.gomezaparicio.com/2010/05/el-camino-del-cliente/) para navegar por su sitio.\n\nComo los indexaba Google vetaron Google News pero queriendo mantener los contenidos indexados no fuera a ser que se perdiera tráfico.\n\nCrearon “granjas” de bots y cuentas “zombies” para que la cajita de TW y FB tuviera una cifra alta de veces compartido, y para SEO, y para no sé cuántas cosas más.\n\nSe quejaron del crecimiento de esa bestia que ellos ayudaron a engordar [sembrando nuestros navegadores de cookies](https://www.gomezaparicio.com/2014/05/a-quien-le-estamos-haciendo-el-caldo/) que regalaban a FB, TW, Google.… datos para mejorar su “profiling”.\n\nMetieron aun más publicidad hasta que el que no abandonó, se enteró de que existían los ad blockers, esa herramienta maravillosa que libera la pantalla del secuestro al que estaba sometida.\n\nLlevaron al extremo la máxima de que un buen titular no te estropee una noticia (¿o era al revés?) y convirtieron el click-bait en un arte. Todo por el tráfico.\n\nSe olvidaron de que la comunicación escrita requiere.… comunicación escrita, y abandonaron la gramática y la ortografía.\n\nY ahora pretenden solucionar sus problemas levantando muros de pago.\n\nY no seré yo quien diga que no hay que pagar por contenidos de calidad o por cualesquiera otros que su propietario o creador decida, pero un poco de autocrítica a lo mejor tampoco vendría mal. Una cosa no quita la otra.\n\nLes deseo mucha suerte. La prensa de calidad es muy necesaria.

I get to combine my love of writing science fiction and fantasy with my love of blockchain, crypto, and web3.\n\nWill I be the first author to publish writing on the blockchain? Who knows, but I’ll tell you this: I won’t be the last, or even close to the best.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mEladi0xRUOPeMn8u3BQP.jpg?height=500&width=333)\n\nI published Dybsy in 2017 and 4 years of development. (Actually, I wrote 80% of the book about 2 months, starting around December 2013, then floundered for a few years before mustering the energy to finish it).\n\nInspired, I began writing my second book, Remember the Dawn, in August 2017. True to form, I wrote 40% of the book in a month, then took another 10 months to finish.\n\nIn 2019, I produced both of books into audio. I don’t even like audiobooks, but they’re there on Audible to be heard.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZiWoV_l4CMlRtQU7T5Ll2.jpg?height=500&width=334)\n\nEver since, I’ve put words to page much like a toddler might thrash about a pool the first time he or she is thrown in by their attentive parent.\n\nThere are many resources for authors who struggle with block, or motivation, or the struggle of completion. I hate them all. Hate is strong. Let me rephrase: I haven’t read, watched, or otherwise paid attention to any of them. I’m aware of their existence, sure, and of their theses, but they don’t really do anything for me.\n\nInstead of spending my time digesting advice from people who want to tell me what to do, I’m going to try something else. I’m going to publish this… book… here on Mirror. I’m going to complete it. And it’s going to feel good.\n\nWhat is this book?\n\nI call it, “The Book of Chapters One”. My chapters one. That is, almost every first chapter of a new story I’ve written since I published my last book. (Including some writing I did prior to publishing my first book. You’ll probably see the difference in writing quality).\n\nWould an anthology of short stories be better received? Almost definitely. Too bad. No resolutions to story arcs for you.\n\nInstead, you will get cliffhangers, over and over, and you come to despise me for leaving your questions unanswered. The characters you loved, or the stories with which you connected—even after just a page or two—will be left hanging.\n\nTHIS IS A GOOD THING.\n\nIf I can draw out your emotion in a first chapter, it means I’m doing something right. And if I can draw out that emotion so much that you feel compelled to tell me about how I am an asshole and simply must keep writing a particular story, all the better.\n\nMaybe I will. That’s where you come in. This will be the public-facing page of my crowdfund! If any of the particular Chapters One catches your attention, and if you want to help me finish the novel with funding, here’s where you can do so!\n\n[crowdfund://0xb03920c2AB59e32bAEf415a2D5594895474A5b75?features=](crowdfund://0xb03920c2AB59e32bAEf415a2D5594895474A5b75?features=)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633455921, "digest": "bkRMRQaHOa7eLqyEo8LDxCeMQe_R5QzFl5HQPnhcjOA", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}

However, we couldn’t find an umbilical cord blood match for my brother.

In fact, [Selma Blair](https://www.usnews.com/news/entertainment/articles/2021-08-16/selma-blair-says-shes-in-remission-from-multiple-sclerosis) recently used umbilical cord blood as part of her treatment for multiple sclerosis (which is now in remission.)\n\nWanting to gauge awareness in the space, I began making [TikToks](http://tiktok.com/@kathrynanja) related to umbilical cord blood banking.\n\n![My most viewed video at 2.9M views](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YDOtexjoqUzKuDAdab1z9.png?height=1792&width=828)\n\nI quickly realized that awareness is limited.

So, I created [Anja Health](http://anjahealth.com/).\n\n**What are Anja Health’s products?**\n\nAnja Health currently has 3 products — umbilical cord blood, cord tissue, and placenta banking — for 3 different types of stem cells that are collected. Anja helps our clients cryopreserve each of these easily, ensuring that they always have access to its powerful stem cells.\n\nThe first is hematopoietic stem cells, which are found in cord blood. These cells are the origin for all cells in the blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, etc. Cord blood is rich with these cells, and can treat many blood-related conditions, such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and Leukemia.\n\nThe second is mesenchymal stem cells, which are found in cord tissue. These cells are the origin for cells in the bones, cartilage, and muscle. Mesenchymal stem cells are being looked at in clinical trials to treat many organ and tissue related problems, such as diabetes, liver disease, lung cancer, and even sports injuries. An increasing number of professional athletes, such as [Kobe Bryant and Peyton Manning](https://bioinformant.com/athletes-stem-cell-treatments/), are using stem cells to treat various bone and muscle-related injuries. Mesenchymal stem cells are found in the cord tissue, hence the importance of additionally banking the umbilical cord.\n\nThe third is amniotic epithelial cells, which are found in the placenta. Their applications are still being tested in clinical trials, but currently, they are used to[ treat eye conditions and wounds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7594030/).\n\n**Why bank?**\n\nBecause of the plentiful possibilities that lie ahead with all of these stem cells, I highly recommend that parents look into banking all 3. If my family had banked all 3, we would have had enough stem cells to potentially treat my grandfather’s recent dementia and my brother’s cerebral palsy. Beyond that, we may have even had enough stem cells for my mom to receive a potential [anti-aging treatment](https://www.dvcstem.com/post/anti-aging-stem-cells). She has been healthy all of her life, but many don’t know that stem cells can be used for general potential anti-aging purposes, opening up possibilities for beauty and wellness treatments as well. Anja Health is reshaping discourse surrounding umbilical cord blood from being simply an extra precaution a few families consider to a commonplace practice families brag about.\n\nStem cell treatments from banked cord blood, tissue, and placenta stem cells can be wonderfully life-altering for sufferers of many diseases. But, today, banking is not simply an insurance policy in the low-probability case that your child gets a disease. Rather, if someone has access to stem cells and they stay up to date with its use cases as they develop (it is a part of Anja’s mission to keep our clients informed even after birth and collection) , they *will* use stem cells at some point in their life.\n\nSo, I invite you and anyone who you may know to bank with Anja.", "timestamp": 1633456190, "digest": "fO0FbFc0FMUbkL0emoqGFIcyOK9ODDqZGYMXeZMHgFk", "contributor": "0x2d172FaaA64B3CcF271901cb87a487792b78d1B1"}

Anja helps our clients cryopreserve each of these easily, ensuring that they always have access to its powerful stem cells.\n\nThe first is hematopoietic stem cells, which are found in cord blood. These cells are the origin for all cells in the blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, etc. Cord blood is rich with these cells, and can treat many blood-related conditions, such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and Leukemia.\n\nThe second is mesenchymal stem cells, which are found in cord tissue. These cells are the origin for cells in the bones, cartilage, and muscle. Mesenchymal stem cells are being looked at in clinical trials to treat many organ and tissue related problems, such as diabetes, liver disease, lung cancer, and even sports injuries. An increasing number of professional athletes, such as [Kobe Bryant and Peyton Manning](https://bioinformant.com/athletes-stem-cell-treatments/), are using stem cells to treat various bone and muscle-related injuries. Mesenchymal stem cells are found in the cord tissue, hence the importance of additionally banking the umbilical cord.\n\nThe third is amniotic epithelial cells, which are found in the placenta. Their applications are still being tested in clinical trials, but currently, they are used to[ treat eye conditions and wounds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7594030/).\n\n**Why bank?**\n\nBecause of the plentiful possibilities that lie ahead with all of these stem cells, I highly recommend that parents look into banking all 3. If my family had banked all 3, we would have had enough stem cells to potentially treat my grandfather’s recent dementia and my brother’s cerebral palsy.

{"id": "R6J1gkJxb5T3vDeMQD3zW-2bZJXVsQPlz1swOHjXZzM", "title": "Summer of rockets - Age of Awareness", "body": "Space rockets are cool! Watching them blast off into space sparks the imagination and creates new generations of dreamers, innovators, designers and engineers. But is this a feasible mode of transport for the future? And should it be welcomed? My gut feeling is a resounding yes! Only money, time and monitoring data will tell. Space travel offers us a promising and potentially carbon reduced future; not to mention, all of the technological innovations that will undoubtedly be birthed in the process.\n\nHowever, we really should address the rocket-sized elephant in the room.\n\n## Rocket Emissions\n\nWe have recently been inundated with news coverage of commercial human space flight. Sir Richard Branson (Virgin Galactic) and Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) conducted what has got to be one of the most expensive product demos in recent history. They kicked off a new aviation industry niche called Space Tourism.\n\nA cursory look at news headlines or listening to Joe Public at your local pub, one could be forgiven for thinking that these space rockets were single-handedly going to destroy the earth. Despite what you may have read or heard, the total number of rockes emissions, globally, is miniscule in comparison to other modes of transport.\n\n![Global rocket emissions (2019)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*lKteL7t3yiEfViGd_VWXeg.png)\n\nHowever, this does not mean the Space Tourism industry should be left unchecked. As rocket launches increase, emissions will increase and the effects of CO2 and N2O in the stratosphere have a different kind of environmental effect. We should take this opportunity to champion a new form of travel whilst implementing the appropriate environmental safeguards.\n\n*If you want to learn more about the details behind rocket emissions, check out my appendix article —*[\\* \\*](https://medium.com/@darryll.colthrust/what-is-the-effect-of-the-virgin-galactic-flight-abc02a02cef0)***[What is the effect of the Virgin Galactic Flight?](https://medium.com/@darryll.colthrust/what-is-the-effect-of-the-virgin-galactic-flight-abc02a02cef0)***\n\n## Space Tourism\n\nJuly 2021 will be a historic month. It was the first marker in a new, “new” age of commercial space tourism and potentially space travel. Space. A destination that 99% of the world’s population didn’t think was in contention until billionaire’s started trolling each other over the Karman Line, suborbital vs orbital flight and asterisks.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Fc6QtUa6eD45TR6dp1oVlA.png)\n\nThe flights were brilliant product demos. In no uncertain terms, Space tourism is going to be an ultra luxury recreational activity. I’m sure there is going to be a Zero G & space craze. Space Hotels, Zero G dinners, parties, space walks, etc… It is a $5Bn niche segment of the aviation industry for the 1% and aspiring.\n\nIt is not space travel. You are not going to another physical location to disembark, yet. Its main purpose is recreation. It will be one of the most expensive 10min (Blue Origin) or 2hr (Virgin Galactic) fairground rides that 99% of the world’s population won’t be enjoying anytime soon. For most, the dream of going into space will only be realised through years of astronaut training or winning a golden ticket.\n\nThe allure of going into space, even for a few minutes of weightlessness should not be underestimated, nor should the extreme exhilaration of experiencing the world from a completely unique perspective. Given the means, I would happily join the queue of 600+ future passengers who have already signed up and paid between $250k.\n\nWhilst I’m laying it all out there, I would also choose the Blue Origin experience. At a similar ticket price, the $/min experience is extorniate, BUT, IT’S A FREAKING ROCKET!!!\n\n## Space Travel is VERY different to Space Tourism\n\nFor the purposes of this article, let’s call space travel, any form of orbital flight. Orbital being anything that leaves Earth’s atmosphere and can remain in space whilst the earth rotates. Space Tourism vessels do not remain in space.\n\nIt is only in recent history we have been able to start building reusable rockets, thus making Space Travel a possibility. Yes, I know the Space Shuttle was partially reusable, but at $211Bn to build with a $576m price tag per launch, it wasn’t cheap.\n\nIn modernish history, prior to commercial airlines, the only way to travel or transport goods long distance, en masse, was by sea or land. We are nearing the point where we have the technology to include space as another medium.\n\nImagine a world where a payload (human or cargo) could get anywhere on earth in less than an hour…and I mean ANYWHERE. Live in London, work in New York. Your commute home will be faster, and a lot more pleasant than current public or private transport. Humanitarian aid would be transformed. Food and infrastructure relief to emergency disaster areas in less than an hour! That would be an amazing sight and a reality I would wholeheartedly welcome.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqE-ultsWt0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqE-ultsWt0)\n\nSpaceX Starship: Travel anywhere on Earth in less than an hour.\n\nThe appropriate inter-governmental environmental policies would, of course, have to be put in place:\n\n* **All rockets are fully reusable**. Build once, use many times. This reduces the rocket launch and manufacturing carbon footprint.\n* **All rocket fuel is environmentally friendly**.\n* **Climate-positive rocket production. Not merely Carbon-neutral. Offsetting isn’t enough and doesn’t change behaviours.**\n* **Open technology and active knowledge sharing**\n\nObviously there are many more but these would be my top priority. The reality we live in shows no matter how much you tax the rich, it’s not enough to dissuade their lifestyle. At minimum, we should ensure their lifestyle does not damage the climate and knowledge is shared to open the market so we can all benefit from this technology and experience the joys of space travel.\n\n## As a kid I had a dream…now I want to make money\n\nNo one is getting into the space tourism and space travel business for altruistic reasons. Musk, Bezos and Branson are in this game to make money and there is a lot of money to be made.\n\n![Global Space Economy (2019)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*6ZL-N22Baf_huJcwZ-_Ijg.png)\n\nElon Musk has been paving the way in the space industry since the 2000’s, dramatically reducing the cost of rocket production and launch. Expendendable rockets costing hundreds of millions of dollars is quickly becoming a thing of the past. Companies can now book SpaceX’s Falcon 9 launch services for as little as $62m. In customary Musk fashion, that isn’t enough. He’s aiming for a $2m launch cost! In 2018, NASA was spending about $152m per launch. If he can follow through on his claims, that would be 1% of what NASA pays for a launch!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*KGEdrtnL6y1IZ-hfaSHeZQ.png)\n\nDeclining costs to launch a rocket ($/kg)\n\nSpaceX’s pitch and reputation went down very well because in May 2021, they won a $2.9Bn contract with NASA to take astronauts into orbit. That is still a small sliver of the pie. Elon Musk is laying down the foundations for a new network infrastructure via his StarLink satellites and can probably take a significant chunk of the navigation device transmisisons. I am sure Bezos, Branson and others are not far behind. Virgin Galactic has already quoted revenues up to $1Bn per ground spaceport they build.\n\nHowever, their space aspirations don’t stop there. The medium (900-2500 miles) to long-haul flights(>2500 miles) in aviation are also up for grabs.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Y8uJdOCfsCiD48OL-pGqFA.png)\n\nThe revenue opportunity for space travel is big and will reduce medium to long-haul flights\n\nEvery year, more people want to fly. Every year, emissions have increased. With so much demand, the impetus is not there to force change. The aviation industry has been asked, prodded and pressured to reduce their emissions. Unfortunately, industries only take reformative action when it will hurt their wallet not to do so. In 2018, The International Council of Clean Transporation reported that 66% of aviation’s passenger flight emissions come from medium and long haul flights.\n\nIt will take a few years before technological advances can bring the price of suborbital travel down, but down they will come. When they do, the aviation industry is going to change because they will not be the dominant force in the skies. The financial and environmental prize for Earth to Earth travel will be huge.\n\n## 2041\n\nTwo decades from now, Earth to Earth is nice. Interplanetary travel and space settlement will be revolutionary. That is the ultimate goal. The race to the red planet is well and truly underway. In that time, the technological advances in the space industry will have trickled down and translated into new products, businesses and industries.\n\nHowever, progress is only world progress in as far as it protects the planet. If these advances in space and settlement can offer technologies that provide green alternatives to aviation, manufacturing and transport, we need not see it as a power to destroy the earth. To move our home planet from a state of amber to green, we can see this industry as a friend of radical change, at a time when we need it most.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgZp0r6qjao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgZp0r6qjao)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633456295, "digest": "h1_fKokI4Q8s8G94pEaLzX-6F7gs0FaH9WUEZmcmvpE", "contributor": "0xd502079a1c7cc86291CeD01F0e818b60deAe6a31"}

We should take this opportunity to champion a new form of travel whilst implementing the appropriate environmental safeguards.\n\n*If you want to learn more about the details behind rocket emissions, check out my appendix article —*[\\* \\*](https://medium.com/@darryll.colthrust/what-is-the-effect-of-the-virgin-galactic-flight-abc02a02cef0)***[What is the effect of the Virgin Galactic Flight?](https://medium.com/@darryll.colthrust/what-is-the-effect-of-the-virgin-galactic-flight-abc02a02cef0)***\n\n## Space Tourism\n\nJuly 2021 will be a historic month. It was the first marker in a new, “new” age of commercial space tourism and potentially space travel. Space. A destination that 99% of the world’s population didn’t think was in contention until billionaire’s started trolling each other over the Karman Line, suborbital vs orbital flight and asterisks.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Fc6QtUa6eD45TR6dp1oVlA.png)\n\nThe flights were brilliant product demos. In no uncertain terms, Space tourism is going to be an ultra luxury recreational activity. I’m sure there is going to be a Zero G & space craze. Space Hotels, Zero G dinners, parties, space walks, etc… It is a $5Bn niche segment of the aviation industry for the 1% and aspiring.\n\nIt is not space travel. You are not going to another physical location to disembark, yet. Its main purpose is recreation. It will be one of the most expensive 10min (Blue Origin) or 2hr (Virgin Galactic) fairground rides that 99% of the world’s population won’t be enjoying anytime soon. For most, the dream of going into space will only be realised through years of astronaut training or winning a golden ticket.\n\nThe allure of going into space, even for a few minutes of weightlessness should not be underestimated, nor should the extreme exhilaration of experiencing the world from a completely unique perspective. Given the means, I would happily join the queue of 600+ future passengers who have already signed up and paid between $250k.\n\nWhilst I’m laying it all out there, I would also choose the Blue Origin experience. At a similar ticket price, the $/min experience is extorniate, BUT, IT’S A FREAKING ROCKET!!!\n\n## Space Travel is VERY different to Space Tourism\n\nFor the purposes of this article, let’s call space travel, any form of orbital flight. Orbital being anything that leaves Earth’s atmosphere and can remain in space whilst the earth rotates. Space Tourism vessels do not remain in space.\n\nIt is only in recent history we have been able to start building reusable rockets, thus making Space Travel a possibility. Yes, I know the Space Shuttle was partially reusable, but at $211Bn to build with a $576m price tag per launch, it wasn’t cheap.\n\nIn modernish history, prior to commercial airlines, the only way to travel or transport goods long distance, en masse, was by sea or land. We are nearing the point where we have the technology to include space as another medium.\n\nImagine a world where a payload (human or cargo) could get anywhere on earth in less than an hour…and I mean ANYWHERE. Live in London, work in New York. Your commute home will be faster, and a lot more pleasant than current public or private transport. Humanitarian aid would be transformed. Food and infrastructure relief to emergency disaster areas in less than an hour! That would be an amazing sight and a reality I would wholeheartedly welcome.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqE-ultsWt0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqE-ultsWt0)\n\nSpaceX Starship: Travel anywhere on Earth in less than an hour.\n\nThe appropriate inter-governmental environmental policies would, of course, have to be put in place:\n\n* **All rockets are fully reusable**. Build once, use many times. This reduces the rocket launch and manufacturing carbon footprint.\n* **All rocket fuel is environmentally friendly**.\n* **Climate-positive rocket production. Not merely Carbon-neutral. Offsetting isn’t enough and doesn’t change behaviours.**\n* **Open technology and active knowledge sharing**\n\nObviously there are many more but these would be my top priority. The reality we live in shows no matter how much you tax the rich, it’s not enough to dissuade their lifestyle. At minimum, we should ensure their lifestyle does not damage the climate and knowledge is shared to open the market so we can all benefit from this technology and experience the joys of space travel.\n\n## As a kid I had a dream…now I want to make money\n\nNo one is getting into the space tourism and space travel business for altruistic reasons. Musk, Bezos and Branson are in this game to make money and there is a lot of money to be made.\n\n![Global Space Economy (2019)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*6ZL-N22Baf_huJcwZ-_Ijg.png)\n\nElon Musk has been paving the way in the space industry since the 2000’s, dramatically reducing the cost of rocket production and launch. Expendendable rockets costing hundreds of millions of dollars is quickly becoming a thing of the past. Companies can now book SpaceX’s Falcon 9 launch services for as little as $62m. In customary Musk fashion, that isn’t enough. He’s aiming for a $2m launch cost! In 2018, NASA was spending about $152m per launch. If he can follow through on his claims, that would be 1% of what NASA pays for a launch!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*KGEdrtnL6y1IZ-hfaSHeZQ.png)\n\nDeclining costs to launch a rocket ($/kg)\n\nSpaceX’s pitch and reputation went down very well because in May 2021, they won a $2.9Bn contract with NASA to take astronauts into orbit. That is still a small sliver of the pie. Elon Musk is laying down the foundations for a new network infrastructure via his StarLink satellites and can probably take a significant chunk of the navigation device transmisisons. I am sure Bezos, Branson and others are not far behind. Virgin Galactic has already quoted revenues up to $1Bn per ground spaceport they build.\n\nHowever, their space aspirations don’t stop there. The medium (900-2500 miles) to long-haul flights(>2500 miles) in aviation are also up for grabs.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Y8uJdOCfsCiD48OL-pGqFA.png)\n\nThe revenue opportunity for space travel is big and will reduce medium to long-haul flights\n\nEvery year, more people want to fly. Every year, emissions have increased. With so much demand, the impetus is not there to force change. The aviation industry has been asked, prodded and pressured to reduce their emissions. Unfortunately, industries only take reformative action when it will hurt their wallet not to do so. In 2018, The International Council of Clean Transporation reported that 66% of aviation’s passenger flight emissions come from medium and long haul flights.\n\nIt will take a few years before technological advances can bring the price of suborbital travel down, but down they will come. When they do, the aviation industry is going to change because they will not be the dominant force in the skies. The financial and environmental prize for Earth to Earth travel will be huge.\n\n## 2041\n\nTwo decades from now, Earth to Earth is nice. Interplanetary travel and space settlement will be revolutionary. That is the ultimate goal. The race to the red planet is well and truly underway. In that time, the technological advances in the space industry will have trickled down and translated into new products, businesses and industries.\n\nHowever, progress is only world progress in as far as it protects the planet. If these advances in space and settlement can offer technologies that provide green alternatives to aviation, manufacturing and transport, we need not see it as a power to destroy the earth. To move our home planet from a state of amber to green, we can see this industry as a friend of radical change, at a time when we need it most.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgZp0r6qjao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgZp0r6qjao)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633456315, "digest": "J_C--Mt5s649HKAwxXsbcQpmDxR7R9_K6AT78x1Ca00", "contributor": "0xd502079a1c7cc86291CeD01F0e818b60deAe6a31"}

DAOs are even highlighted in the Ethereum whitepaper. But how will we know when they are ready for prime time?\n\nI think the most important dynamic to look at is how efficient DAOs are at accomplishing their goals in comparison to traditional organizations (TradOrgs). Secondarily, I would look at the Learning Rate for each of these types of organizations.\n\nThere are three properties of DAOs that stand out to me as I reason about their Learning Rate:\n\n1. **Experimentation Rate:** Following lots of activity in DeFi and NFTs, there’s a lot of new capital in crypto that people are excited to put to work. DAO experimentation is attracting that capital. Simultaneously, the tooling and infrastructure to launch DAOs (as mentioned in [the piece from The Defiant](https://thedefiant.io/what-is-a-dao-mapping-out-the-ecosystem/) above) is becoming increasingly robust, making DAOs less expensive to launch.\n2. **Propagation of Successful Experiments via Forking:** The ecosystem of crypto protocols is largely open-source, both technologically and philosophically. Across currencies and DeFi, we have already seen forks of massive projects (e.g. Bitcoin → Bitcoin Cash; Uniswap → Sushiswap). These forks have been able to take what works, make opinionated changes, then quickly attract capital and usership. The same dynamic will play out in DAOs for governance and compensation structures. This means successful DAO experiments will spread across the ecosystem quickly, and fewer projects have to fail in order to achieve a high Learning Rate.\n3. **DAO Ecosystem Network Effects:** Much like a Web2 marketplace or platform, DAOs have internal network effects. But unlike Web2, interoperability is a core philosophy of many DAOs. For example, there are a number of DAOs that allow you to gain membership either as an individual or as another DAO. Today, DAOs are holding each other’s tokens, working on each other’s infrastructure, and partnering to build projects. This leads me to believe that the network effects of the DAO ecosystem will be even more robust than what we’ve seen in Web2.\n\nThese three factors add up to an exponential Learning Rate for DAOs. The DAO Ecosystem is a network of networks that is highly capable of propagating and utilizing the latest knowledge created anywhere in the network.\n\nIn contrast, the Learning Rate for TradOrgs seems to be linear growth at best. Sure, companies today learn quickly about how to operate their particular business. But there isn’t rapid iteration in these TradOrgs in organizational design, decision-making, or compensation. The Learning Rate for TradOrgs is more like the pace of organizations undergoing Agile Transformations (years), or slowly cycling in and out of the S&P500 (decades).\n\nThe organizational efficiency of linear growth TradOrgs will be overcome (quickly) by exponential growth DAOs.

When you are connected to the internet with your IP address, it is your identity, similar to your physical being, where you have the ability to interact with the objects on the network. The metaverse defines the state of your internet id(IP address) in relation to its interactions to the objects(websites, protocols etc) on the networks.\n\n**Oxford Dictionary Definition:** a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.\n\nMetaverse is a playful name that is a fusion of two words. Meta and Universe. It suggests that the internet allows us to define new virtual planes of existence that are governed with different laws of *physics(metaphorically)* and these planes of existence separate from each other. However, the interesting part is, these virtual planes can *communicate* so they are connected to each other i a *meta* level.\n\n**3.1.2. Current Metaverses**\n\n**3.1.2.1. Twitter**\n\nA plane of existence where you can define an identity by a profile picture, with an arbitrary *bio(a small public summary about yourself)* and 280 character worth of information bits you provide by *tweeting* your views.\n\n**3.1.2.2 Instagram**\n\nA plane of existence where you can define an identity *by the moments you capture as a form of photographs whether it be you or other objects* and display them on your profile.\n\n**3.1.2.3. Video Games**\n\nVideo games are a bit different form of a plane of existence other than Instagram and Twitter. Video games do not only define protocols(like instagram and twitter) that allow you to use their functions in a certain way, they also define a virtual spatial environment where you can operate and navigate by vector.\n\n**3.1.2.4. Discord Servers (Emerging)**\n\nDiscord has been around since 2015 but new trends of NFT technology allows for communities to contribute to its usage of substantial functionalities(more on that later).\n\nDiscord is a plane of existence where people with the same interests come together into an online channel in the form of a *Discord Server* where they can engage with other community members. It has dissected channels for the topics that are related to the server's theme. It has excessive *emoji(a small digital image or icon used to express an idea or emotion.)* capabilities where you can customize and add your own emojis that mirrors your server's culture. The timeline of the server's channels' flow is in real time, which makes the experience substantially engaging. You can share videos, gifs, and photos. Server administrators can make announcements, organize members and launch online events all in the same plane of existence, the Discord Server.\n\nThere are also customizable automation tools in the form of *Discord Bots.* This is a whole different topic but essentially what they do is, they are introducing *customizable functionalities* that have never been seen before in any type of social media channel ever existed.\n\n**Overall Summary:** The Internet is still an emerging space that creates new ways of interfacing with other people, furthermore with reality itself.\n\n## **4. Defining a New Comprehensive Approach to Metaverse**\n\n**4.1. Community**\n\n**4.1.1. Incentives**\n\n**4.1.1.1. Introduction**\n\nTo sustain a cooperation mechanism between agents(network participants) that are going to play a fundamental part of an emergence of something like metaverse, those cooperation mechanisms should be self-sufficient. Self sufficiency couldn't be achieved by hard coded laws by *a segment of developers* because this would limit infinite possibilities of new branches\\*,\\* Instead it could be achieved by quantifiable measurable value standards that enable community members to create, capture and transform value between themselves and other protocols without limiting the interfacing metaverses' ability to set their own standards.\n\n**4.1.1.2. Metaverse Value Standard**\n\nThere should be a common denominator of value vehicles to quantify value in the metaverse for *network participants to reach an agreement with each other to assess value*. This denominator should be *interoperable, **programmable**, composable, decentralized, secure, immutable, scarce, fast, recognizable etc.* This denominator doesn't have to harbor all of the features natively, rather it can allow those features to be recreated into its function with creative approaches by its programmability. Example to this can be: to incorporate speed function to Ethereum, proposing different type of layer 2 solutions. This is possible because of Ethereum's **programmability.**\n\n*At the time of this writing, the closest thing to this is the Ethereum Ecosystem. This paper is going to present its content with a pre-conceived notion of taking Ethereum Ecosystem as the base solution to the Metaverse Standard.*\n\n**4.1.1.3. Non Fungible Tokens**\n\nNon Fungible Tokens, NFTs, are *identified objects* on the blockchain. These objects can interface with protocols therefore they are *programmable.* Their identifiability and programmability allows infinite possibilities of their usage in the virtual plane of existence that is called metaverse.\n\nNon Fungible Tokens also allow something for people to become more intuitive participants of the blockchain ecosystem. They can *choose* a digital handle as their identity. This way, they would be *known* in their community on the metaverse *by the way they choose, not the way they have given* as physical reality appoints people a certain look, race, nationality, or personal history.\n\nNon fungible tokens allow to *launch a completely new existence on the blockchain* where the new identity would be entirely what the owner of it would choose it to be.\n\n**4.1.1.4 Micro Economical Alignment of Community Members**\n\nEvery conceivable community structure is going to marginalize themselves from the others by creating a common culture while staking capital to it. The ownership of that community's culture in the form of that community's scarce NFT pieces allows a possibility to signal stake in the community in the form of capital. This is inherently different from the common practice of virtue signaling that is being observed especially in the online communities where it takes virtually no resources at all.\n\nOwnership of NFTs of an online community is entirely different from the previous online community formations. Now, the owners of NFTs have an economical stake in the community. In other words, if the community does good in the future, their early participation of the community with staked capital\n\nwill be rewarded. This will incentivize the NFT owners of the community to push the community value more and more. They would get along with other community members well. They would hold events with each other. They would signal the existence of their online tribe on other platforms etc. Social networking collapsed into microeconomics where statue indicators became quantifiable capital stakes(more on this later).\n\n**Conclusion:** Primary metaverse standard is not an arbitrary protocol structure. It is a consensus of the largest and most impactful community.\n\n**4.1.2 Adoption**\n\n**4.1.2.1. Culture**\n\n**4.1.2.1.1. Memetics**\n\n**4.1.2.1.1.1. Introduction**\n\nMemetics term was first coined by Richard Dawkins in his book: The Selfish Gene(1976). It was an analogy to genes that points out similarities of **ideas(memes)** and **genes** in their characteristic on how they self replicate themselves and propagate.\n\nInternet memes can be viewed as the second version(and a more observable one) of this phenomenon that an idea in form of a *photo, a video clip, a tweet, or a new way of expression of a word(karen, boomer, sus, fud, fomo, stonks etc.)* can have an extreme virality where too many people on the internet can adopt a new idea(a new way of thinking) in matter of days. Internet memes are mostly visual, and if they have the right characteristics, they can invoke extreme popularity with reasonable retention in people's lives. Our approach to memes is that we want to collide our visual NFTs with phenomenal characteristics of memes where we want to create a sub culture of **crypto adopters where they are going to become the active users of the protocols instead of buyers, sellers and holders.**\n\n**4.1.2.1.1.2. Story/Lore**\n\nMemes have stories behind them, and those stories create relevance. If the relevance is strong enough it invokes virality and retention. Stories have always been humanity's strong hand to create long living principles by transmitting those principles in forms of religions, myths, tales etc. Storytelling has been strong because humans comprehend concepts more easily when they are in a saturated context.\n\nOur approach to this characteristic of humans, we are going to build entertaining myths to gamify our collective metaverse community building program to make the crypto ecosystem more relevant to perception of average joe.\n\n**4.1.2.2. Usage**\n\n**4.1.2.2.1. Nurturing the community**\n\n**4.1.2.2.1.1. Lowering knowledge barrier to entry**\n\nFor something to be used, it should be understood by its users. The technology adoption gets slower the more it gets complicated. To drive adoption, taking an approach of both educating the potential users and driving the complexity down is a fertile approach.\n\nAnother approach could be, without driving the complexity down, we can educate potential users by **driving the complexity of information down to make it appealing to the general public.** This approach is also targeted towards creating an internet native approach to education. This type of education is also based on creating human native learning protocols, instead of aiming towards producing competent individuals for **particular industries' deficits(as of now what universities became/becoming).**\n\n**4.1.2.2.1.2. Use Intuition**\n\nLearning is not storing information in our memory, or recalling information when there is a relevant landscape for it.\n\nLearning is understanding something that enables you to navigate in the world by the insight incorporated that you have gotten from that experience of learning.\n\nThis does not simply by acquiring information by **reading or listening,** this only happens when engaging with the reality by the information acquired. This also builds a form of intuition\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\nOur approach is servicing a human native approach of education where we both serve information along with its use case where people practice their use on the go. This way, they unlock their **use intuition** so they can navigate in the crypto ecosystem and especially in the metaverse smoothly.\n\n**4.1.2.2.2. Economical Viability**\n\n**4.1.2.2.2.1. Introduction**\n\nThe crypto scene as most people exposed to it knows is a new financial paradigm. It introduces a decentralized more efficient approach to infinitely programmable financial transactions between parties. This enables countless ways of innovation that creates more viable approaches to the global economy in unprecedented ways. We are going to discover these in detail at the Fundamental **Building Blocks Summarized** section.\n\n**4.1.2.2.2.2. Banklesness**\n\n**4.1.2.2.2.2.1. Low Financial Barrier to Entry**\n\nYou can start financially exposing yourself starting with as low as $10 to a new economical protocol to kick start your intellectual and financial rediscovery of interfacing with the new global economic paradigm.\n\n**4.1.2.2.2.2.2. Global**\n\nYour financial exposure is, with the banklessness approach, to the whole world. This is a direct exposure to the all possibilities of financial benefits of all productivity that can be produced in the globe. This is different from being only affected by your nation's abilities of economic advancement. This does not only liberate you from your physical location's limitations, it also introduces you to all human potential that is not bound by any constitution that is set by the establishment of any kind.\n\n**4.1.2.2.2.2.3. Cheap**\n\nThis new approach introduces extreme efficiency where no establishment of any kind whether it be protocols or organizations can have a monopoly on. This means the free market is more free than ever. Since there are no monopolistic establishments that are covered **by any nation of any kind(like bailing out banks)** market efficiency drives the prices down while raising the yields up according to market needs.\n\n**4.1.2.2.2.2.4. Permission less**\n\nTo be exposed to the new global financial paradigm, you don't have to fill out forms. You don't have to provide your social security number. You don't need approval from anywhere to move value around the globe. This takes out the third parties, and any type of reinforcements on the value you hold on the blockchains.\n\n**4.1.2.2.2.2.2.5. Summary**\n\nYou can use the value you possess in any shape of form in the bankless ecosystem. This unlocks unlimited possibilities of creative ways for you to efficiently produce value in a paradigm that is only driven by pure efficiency. People adopt what is directly beneficial to them.\n\n**4.1.2.2.3. Engaging Content**\n\n**4.1.2.2.3.1. Practice Actuation**\n\nOur approach produces events that **financially** motivate its community members to practice their abilities to navigate in the metaverse.\n\n**4.1.2.2.3.2. Call To Action**\n\nMotivation of community members are proposed in forms of actionable steps by financial stake reinforcements. This is aimed towards creating a **cue, routine, reward** mechanism for community members to form valuable habits that are useful in the metaverse ecosystem.\n\n**4.1.2.2.3.3. Collective Events**\n\nAs far as individual competency enhances there also is another trait that is valuable for any given community. Harmony of community members. The harmony is easily achieved by value alignment but there is also a duration needed for people to adopt an interfacing style between each other for smooth social transactions that sets productive squads towards common goals. This is also a paramount property that a given collective is required to incorporate.\n\n**4.1.3. Gamification**\n\n**4.1.3.1. Transactional World**\n\n**4.1.3.1.1. Bounties**\n\nWould you like to outsource something small like a 30 minutes google search to someone else with the same values as the community you share around the globe? Here, put out a 3 dollar worth of a bounty and transact that amount with zero fees instantly inside the community. This also enables you to build relationships starting small that could be fruitful for bigger collaborations in the future.\n\n**4.1.3.1.2. Commissions**\n\nDescribe the job. Put the bounty. Check their previous works they have completed inside of the community and make a trustless payment with zero fees.\n\n**4.1.3.1.3. Tips**\n\nTip valuable community members: feedback, comments, contributions you like. Build reciprocate relationships.\n\n**4.1.3.1.4. Services**\n\nPurchase services from the community members. View their statue in the community by the stake they share with it and insure your satisfaction of outcome.\n\n**4.1.3.1.5. Conclusion**\n\nThe exclusive community that is governed by education, meritocracy and financial staking results in members of the community producing quality transactions that are incentivized to make valuable decisions and rise in the ranks of a value creation based collective.\n\n**4.2. Relevant Mental Models**\n\n**4.2.1 Video Game Socializing**\n\nMultiplayer video games require collaboration between players. It has been overlooked by the establishment over the years, but now we see that their practical impact in society and the new generation has this long tail effect where people are just socializing and collaborating with people all over the world for a common goal of, for example winning the round, being successful on a particular task. This is a form of a practical implication that trains people's game theoretical intuition throughout their gaming experience. Our project will produce quantifiable experiments on this mental modal in ongoing development.\n\n**4.2.2. Social Transactions**\n\nSocial transactions can be viewed as implicit transactions between humans. Good manners is a good example of this. People get to know each other by displaying a behavior that has effects on each other that builds social ties between them. The current problem is, these social transactions are extremely entropical in the society, especially in the internet, where there is no long term persistence of the community members that people can build strong relationships with each other. If there would be a mechanism that would keep like minded individuals to have persisting social transactions, it could help building thousands of persisting relationships for each individual. We will also set experiments on this and quantify these with scientific methods by quantifying them with a sociological approach.\n\n**4.2.3. Financial Stake Based Statue Signaling**\n\nThis is what NFTs do really well. People, for the first time, are able to signal their status in a quantifiable way by cashing in to the regular online communities by the way of buying its NFT. You can quantify the financial stake of an individual in a community that builds an objective view of their stake, belief, commitment by a lot of factors by blockchain based tokens. An example:\n\nSomeone bought a community NFT when it was 400 dollars, and they refuse to sell it when it is worth 30,000 dollars. This instantly signals to community members that even the person who bought the NFT too cheaply still has a strong belief in the community where they are holding onto their overtly appreciated asset. The scarce and verifiable element of NFT Tokens creates a strong social structure that is signaled through resources is a revolutionary way of aligning individuals that don't even directly know each other but they can see which individuals are more invested in a particular community because they exactly know which individual has more motivations to keep the community afloat.\n\n**4.2. Fundamental Building Blocks Summarized and Exemplified**\n\n**4.2.1. Decentralization**\n\n**4.2.1.1. Security**\n\n**4.2.1.1.1. Immutability**\n\nYour tokens' ownership cannot be altered on the blockchain. This gives you full ownership of your digital assets. Think this as Instagram cannot ban you out of your followers.\n\n**4.2.2. Transparency**\n\n**4.2.2.1. Complete Supervision**\n\nEverybody can see who has the tokens on the blockchain. This makes founders really auditable. Think this as you can see your boss' balance sheet and his profits so you can hold him accountable about why he is not giving you a raise.\n\n**4.2.2.2 Accountability**\n\nYou can only hold accountable people if you know what they are up to. Blockchain enables people to see what value they hold, once it is disclosed by the owners which is common by founders, and where they spend it and how it has turned out. It is verifiable in decentralized fashion which means you don't have to take anyone's word for it.\n\n**4.2.3. Interoperability**\n\nThe tokens on the same protocol can interface with other protocols. Think this as you can import your Twitter followers into Instagram followers.\n\n**4.2.4. Speed**\n\nYou can make instant value transactions with trusted relatively centralized layer 2 solutions that infrequently update the transactions on a base more secure protocol like Ethereum. Think this as carrying 100,000 dollars in a bank while holding 500 dollars cash in the wallet.\n\n**4.2.5. Governance**\n\n**4.2.5.1. Chosen Dictators**\n\n**4.2.5.1.1. Representation**\n\nProtocols have dictators as founders. They represent the protocol by their competency and they dictate where it goes. Think this as you like the service of Amazon and Jeff Bezos is what handles it to be as efficient as it is.\n\n**4.2.5.1.2. Optionality**\n\n**4.2.5.1.2.1. Forks**\n\nProtocol is open, if a part of community members don't like the **protocol's dictator's** way of doing stuff they can instantly copy the project and continue where they left from the tokens they hold in existence.\n\n**4.2.5.1.2.2. Snap Exit**\n\nYou don't like the metaverse formation of the current community, then you can instantly sell your tokens and navigate somewhere else. Think this as selling your stock when you lost interest in a company, or instantly moving to another country with no drawbacks.\n\n**4.2.5.2. Meritocracy**\n\nSince the protocols are driven by efficiency, the smarter the moves you can take the more power you will hold by its efficiency. Anybody in the community can instantly fund your ideas if they think it will be efficient and this will result in the efficient person holding more power in the protocol. Think of this as allocating funds to the particular senator to raise their voting and influence instantly.\n\n**4.2.5.3. Market Judged**\n\nSince the protocols are judged by markets from day one, you can view the efficiency of the protocol day by day. This forms a semi-anarchical formation where your power is not given by the establishment you have produced, it is under question everyday by the impact you have on markets. This is self evident and doesn't need an analogy.\n\n**4.2.5.4. Infinite Game Structure**\n\nCommunity members are now playing a value game between each other. They are transacting, funding, judging the value everyday. This assists building long term relationships judged by value, not statute. Think this as you can see every and each person's contribution to society from day one. This is possible via blockchains.\n\n**4.2.5.5. Rewarding Vote Mechanism**\n\nThe vote you have taken with the tokens you have provided would have a direct effect on your value in the community. Think this as the people who voted for the good policies that were beneficial to the society get quantifiable rewards proportion to their impact.\n\n## **5. Infinitely Iterated Games Formation on Metaverses**\n\n**5.1. Relevance of Game Theory**\n\nMembers of society have incentives that motivates them to collaborate with other community members. These incentives make unstable deals in short term relationships where the parties are trying to maximize the gains they can get from the given commission because they will not be dealing with the same agents in the future. This is apparently multiplied by the internet by its native entropical atomic relationships and geolocational barriers.\n\nAccording to game theory, the more a relationship is destined for the long term, the more that relationship is stable because parties are incentivized to negotiate fairly that sets a good grounds for future transactions between them.\n\nOur approach is creating a cone community where people of the internet would be able to build value based long term relationships that maximizes fair negotiations of members of the internet community by our DAO structure. Creating immutable transaction histories of community members where new participants can see the historical structure of the transactions and assess the current long term relationship formation of the given metaverse community in their decision making process on which parties they would like to cooperate that is relevant to their expectations and goals.\n\n**5.2. The Standard Games Online Community Members Play**\n\n**5.2.1. Virtue Signaling**\n\nIn online platforms, people pronounce widely recognized politically correct discourses to gain social status among their peers. It is consistently becoming a trained habit where it creates groupthink tendencies in the society that takes away individual original thinking abilities. They are constantly trying to signal their virtue that fits the contemporary view where the good portion of the society is missing the point that today's contemporary, tomorrow's ignorance.\n\nThis virtue signaling is usually dishonest and deceptive because it is easy to produce. It is easy to make just by proclaiming a particular view. If a signal is cheap to produce, there is a lot of it on the market which makes it low worth and it makes it hard to pick up in the crowd because there is too much of it.\n\nWe view this form of signaling as unproductive and useless.\n\n**5.2.2. Value Signaling**\n\nValue signaling is not that of a term which is widely used, *because there is so few of it.* Basically, anything that creates value, signals value. It is easy to pick up because it is easy to quantify. We are fond of value signaling, which has many different forms, because it sums up an objectively positive value to the parties exposed and to the overall society.\n\n**5.2.3. Zero Sum Games**\n\nStatus is a zero sum game for example. There are mostly social games and they are inherently zero sum games. To gather status value, you should win *against* someone, not win *with* someone. These games are mostly short-lived games. These types of games create contradiction more than collaboration. We need status games in the society to see who should be in charge in particular matters, but we believe climbing in the status games shouldn't happen by removing someone from their place, instead it should happen by creating more value and naturally getting to a *newly created higher rank.*\n\n**5.2.4. Positive Sum Games**\n\nPositive sum games are the best games that ever existed so far. Basically, it is a game that creates value for all *parties.* When there are positive sum games present, every participant of the game is gaining value from the game regardless of their position. The amount they gain would be proportionate to their contributions but they would gain some value anyway.\n\nTechnology is a good example of this. Antibiotics are a good invention for all society members. Cars, planes, phones, efficient ways of production etc.\n\nPositive sum games can only be sustained by the long term thinking parties because they will be interacting with a lot of different agents. This would require that all the other agents should be able to get some value out of it because first, they would keep playing it and second they would not go against it.\n\nWe are fond of these types of games driving long term human creativity and productivity that result in overall benefits for the whole society.\n\n**5.2.5. New Approach: Adding all up: Virtue, Value, Zero Sum and Positive Sum Games**\n\nOur structure enables us to signal Virtue and Value at the same time. It will also enable people to play semi-Zero Sum games as well as full positive sum games. We can simply list its features like:\n\n**5.2.5.1. Virtue Signaling & Value Signaling Mixed:**\n\nBuy the NFTs or Tokens that signal your ideas. Stake your money to the community you support. Signal your virtue with your token, signal your value by the resources you have *invested* in the community. This is a revolutionary version of producing these types of signals because, you can both be virtually included to the extensive communities you support and you can stake your resources to those communities' future success where you can also capture the upside of that success *quantifiably.*\n\n**5.2.5.2. Zero Sum and Positive Sum Games Mixed:**\n\nGet into a community of your choice and provide resources. Provide value and raise up your community's influence over time by its free market valuation. The more a community's influence increases by its value provision to the free markets the more you raise up in the ranks of quantifiable values of market judged communities. A community that collectively provides more value over a new protocol is a positive value creation. Since it is also an open source community protocol, other people can implement the same type of solutions as much as they please. This also breaks the monopolistic nature of mob culture that is enabled by the establishment around it. There would not be establishment enforced zero sum games, there would only be market valuation based individually enforced monopolies, where the monopolistic structures become more and more meritocratic instead of diplomatic.\n\nThis is a more detailed subject to discover but it is out of the scope of this whitepaper. We are going to cover this at ongoing development.\n\n# **6. Utility of $GAMES Metaverse**\n\n**6.1. Collective Consensus on Value**\n\n**6.1.1. Inherent Economical Alignment**\n\n**6.1.1.1. Introduction**\n\nOnline community tokens in the form of NFTs introduce something that previous online communities didn't have: economical alignment based on the same personal interests. What do we mean by that? When there is a community that has been kick started by an NFT collection with a theme that a particular segment of people would be interested in, they can invest in communities they would like to be a part of. For example:\n\nYou are interested in cyberpunk art and there is an online community that is launching a 10.000 pieces collection that consist of cyberpunk themed graphical NFTs. The pieces of the collection signals the taste of the community that an average human can understand more easily than buying an ERC-20 token because they are holding a partly subjectively valued piece that they can see and value based on their taste.\n\nThis enables community members to have a financial stake in the online communities they would like to be a part of and motivates them to improve its overall quality. Buying a piece of the collection also quantifies their interest in the community as well. This alignment and verifiability of someone's concern and stake of the community was harder to achieve before setting a programmable graphical token, such as an graphical(picture) NFT because the fungible tokens of communities is harder to perceive than holding a distinct token as Non-Fungible Tokens, NFTs.\n\n**6.1.1.2. Self Regulating Collective**\n\nWhen you look at the NFT holders of the online community members, you can see an obvious but not widely recognized trend. The token holders of those online communities are now financially aligned to the point they turn into a self regulating collective. What this means is, they are working for the community's success for their tokens to appreciate both internally and externally. The microeconomics principles push them to be held accountable for the community's behavior. Internally, they become more kind, more diligent and more welcoming. Externally, they promote the project, trying to recruit other members to the online community and even create content for the project without direct compensation from the founders.\n\nThese were apparent before NFTs as well, but NFTs recruit more people by their more intuitive adoption characteristics by reuniting people with the same field of interests.\n\nWe are aware of these and we are going to leverage these by creating sustainable incentives on top of these.\n\n**6.2. Collective Value Creation**\n\n**6.2.1. Investing**\n\nWhen there are aligned community members where the whole idea of this community is becoming long term members of that collective, investing turns into funds where the competent researchers shine by their track record as along with their strong connections those documented at the transactions of that particular token contract.\n\n**6.2.2. Founding**\n\nFounding becomes easier when you have reached the funds. Reaching funds becomes easier when you have been judged by a wide variety of people that share the same field of interest and value with you. Their judgement of you and your ideas also mature over time through long term games played in the community that you can get funds to your ideas overnight.\n\nAlso, long term games on the scale of the internet helps you to know who is capable of what. This enables you to co-found with the right people and recruit the talent right alongside with it.\n\n**6.2.3. Informing**\n\nThe current world structure of information on the internet is completely self motivated which means people share the information according to their goals and most of the time they manipulate the information that helps them achieve their goals as well.\n\nWhen there is a long term structure of a community, information sharing becomes more credible and more qualified because each and every contribution is going to pay dividends to the value of the community and to its provider. This better incentivized structure is superior to the usual media company structures where the incentives are towards maximizing the revenue through agitative information provision or biased views of paid advertisements.\n\n**6.2.4. Developing**\n\nPositive sum for the community members induces more development. More development induces more positive sum for the community. The long term structure of a community introduces exponential scalability of the development of any kind of innovative concept.\n\n**6.2.5. Building Long Term Relationships**\n\nBuilding long term relationships to *scale* our **Infinitely Iterated Games** structure is what we are focused on. We believe that when the people, agents, and different parties align for the long term collaboration, the improvement of efficiency comes naturally. This is already proven in the global markets over and over again. What we are focused on is creating a *scaled* way of Infinitely Iterated games through our and other online communities where we can bring quantifiable positive sum games to the whole scale of the internet. We believe the entropical structure and information based internet attention economy can be structured into lifelong games through metaverses. The whole point of ours is, building a protocol that enables human creativity and collaboration on a mass scale.\n\nWe believe this takes a multi disciplinary approach that comes to life by **iterations** by collective effort to create aligned incentives, values, standards for its participants, meanwhile not monopolizing the structure as Facebook, Twitter or other metaverse like landscapes did. We want to create an open protocol that the beneficiaries of this structure would be anybody who would be part of its structure in their own choice of exposure. This doesn't mean we don't want to capture the value for ourselves as well. This means that as we believe in positive sum games, this approach would create more value for **us** and the **others** alike compared to keeping a walled garden as traditional company structures are formed which also creates contradictions of resource allocation struggles.\n\nLet's win and make others win within.\n\n**6.3. Collective Sovereignty**\n\n**6.3.1. Total Legitimacy**\n\nWhen it is carefully scrutinized, what we are offering is a cloud state-like formation that has capable leaders with meritocratic participants around them. What renders the legitimacy of those leaders, first their competency is judged directly by the market structures, second you can change your cloud state/DAO structured online community in an instant instead of a regular state you live in by selling your stake in the community and leaving it for good.\n\nThis renders the choice of the cloud state %100 legitimate by the vote amount rather than a regular democracy in which the leaders are rendered legitimate by little over half of the population.\n\nThis makes community members more sovereign by extreme optionality.\n\n**6.3.2. Social Safeguard**\n\nWe all are introduced to the mob rule of the internet culture. Partisanship mongering media companies enrages the internet mobs to gang up on people on the internet because they disagree with a notion some groupthink formations share.\n\nLong term aligned internet relationships can safeguard these individuals against the chaotic mobs that form in a day and scatter purposelessly. This introduces more sovereignty to the individual as much as the online community itself.\n\nThe weak currency of enragement that the scaled mobs share replaced with long term formulated long term collectives.\n\n**6.4. Collective Financial Value**\n\n**6.4.1. Bulk Negotiations**\n\n**6.4.1.1. Purchases**\n\nThink about a community that makes financial decisions with each other. This opens a possibility for them to make cooperative financial purchases together. For example: Think about how you want to buy a subscription and it is 20 dollars a month. And you have a community that has 10.000 members in it and 1000 of them have already bought into that subscription. You can easily negotiate with the company by cooperating with the long term community members to drive the prices down by let's say %30. You instantly saved 6000 dollars a month collectively, just by one bulk purchase. You can fund a project in the community, practically for free, and take a shot for advancement of the community as well as making an upside along with it.\n\n**6.4.1.2. Other Possibilities**\n\nBulk negotiations create a lot of possibilities that sovereign communities can leverage its efficiencies. We are going to develop different solutions in this area. Some examples could be: Insurance Packages, Legal deals with governments, provision of airbnb like living spaces for all around the world, mobility solutions for nomads etc.\n\nThis is a really exciting way of producing yield just by leveraging a community's power without effort. More on that in later papers.\n\n**6.5. Wisdom of Crowds**\n\nCollective opinion of a group of individuals proven to be better than a single expert when it is judged by the free mechanism like free markets.\n\nWisdom of crowds in markets is already a good mechanism of judgement, but imagine that collective wisdom when it is leveraged by cone culture that pushes those individuals' members to be more meritocratic, efficient and prudent.\n\n## **What's next?**\n\nHere, our first whitepaper version 1.0 is finished. Our next step is: we are going to initialize a crowdfunding launch of the **Infinitely Iterated Games, $GAMES,** ERC20 token.

{"id": "IgzFHyuIBgBYD9JZR487k_MlROJZj2jJ6FuhJdZ1n3s", "title": "Damn Vulnerable DeFi: Unstoppable ", "body": "*Warning: Solution to the challenge will be discussed here. Also note, I could be totally fucking wrong about everything I’m about to write. This is mostly just me long form “tweeting into the ether” about my smart contract journey. Proceed with caution.*\n\n## Problem\n\n> There’s a lending pool with a million DVT tokens in balance, offering flash loans for free.\n>\n> If only there was a way to attack and stop the pool from offering flash loans …\n>\n> You start with 100 DVT tokens in balance.\n\nSo from jump, this particular problem is pretty clear that we don’t need to necessarily try to drain the contract or anything but just stop it from offering flash loans. I’m not really sure how that’s done without bankrupting the contract, so let’s take a look at the code…\n\n![An image of the ReceiverUnstoppable smart contract](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*LLLk4rIwn8png7hIBganwA.png)\n\nChecking out the Receiver contract for the flash loan and I’m not noticing anything too wonky here…\n\n### constructor\n\nHere we just set the `owner` of the contract to match the address that deployed the contract initially as well as set the `pool` (of type `UnstoppableLender`) to point to the contract we’re hoping to freeze. Nothing special to see here (or is there?).\n\n### receiveTokens\n\nThis is an external function meant to be called by `UnstoppableLender` in order to move tokens to the `ReceiverUnstoppable` , specifying two arguments the `tokenAddress` which is basically the address of the contract holding the state for a particular ERC20 that we are trying to transfer to `Receiver` , and an `amount` that details exactly how many tokens we should be sending.\n\nFrom the first line of this function, we see that in order for this function to not revert, the address that called this particular function must have come from the `pool` variable we set up in the constructor.\n\n> Sidenote: the `transfer` method is a method that looks like this for any ERC20, where we can move value from the contract to whichever address we specify `_to` with an appropriate `_value` and returns a `bool` indicating if the call was successful or not.\n>\n> `function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`\n\nAfter we satisfy the first condition, we move onto the second requirement that casts the ERC20 standard over the provided `tokenAddress` in the arguments (to ensure we have access to that `transfer` f(x) you see up there).\n\nSo this seems to be pretty on par with a flash loan recipients’ obligations to their lender. As long as we’re getting tokens from the DVT pool and then sending them back at the end all of the state changes we attempt with this flash loan should be accepted.\n\n### executeFlashLoan\n\nSo this looks like a f(x) that’s meant to be called by the `owner` of the `ReceiverUnstoppable` contract that was set in the constructor and it only expects an `amount` to request in the form of a flash loan. The final line of this function appears to call on the `pool` object that’s pointing at the DVT contract to make a request for some ⚡️ loans.\n\n![An image of the UnstoppableLender smart contract](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*23UjvYDiRhw12-8GccQyQA.png)\n\nI’m seeing a lot of OpenZeppelin standards at the top which gives me very little faith that I’ll be draining this contract completely. I’m pretty new to this but typically seeing these libraries means I’m not gonna be able to rely on [reentrancy](https://medium.com/coinmonks/protect-your-solidity-smart-contracts-from-reentrancy-attacks-9972c3af7c21) or [arithmetic bs](https://medium.com/coinmonks/math-in-solidity-part-2-overflow-3cd7283714b4) here. There doesn’t seem to be anything about ownership of contract though… 🧐\n\nI’m also noticing that this contract seems to have an interface for the `receiveTokens` f(x) that’s written out in our other contract of concern for this challenge.\n\n### constructor\n\nSo a few things, we’re using SafeMath to manage arithmetic and try to stop overflows, so it’s not likely that we’ll be able to fuck off `poolBalance` which is of type uint256, and then we have public access to the DamnValuableToken ERC20 implementation as well as the poolBalance that seems pretty well guarded although visible.\n\nHere, we just want to provide a token address that should point to the location of the DamnValuableToken ERC20 implementation and make sure it’s not pointing to the null address `address(0)` at which point we point our DamnValuableToken at the `tokenAddress` provided by `msg.sender` when they deployed the function.\n\n### depositTokens\n\nSomething about the use of a wrapper deposit function instead of using native functions within ERC20 standard feels intuitively off to me, but I’m also pretty ignorant as to what current best practices are for most shit like this right now. But this particular wrapper is expecting an `amount` to be provided by the address that calls this function and we are doing a check immediately to make sure that `msg.sender` isn’t calling this with zero tokens to deposit.\n\n> Sidenote: the `transferFrom` method is again part of the ERC20 standard, that differentiates from the previously inspected `transfer` only in that we are not explicitly deciding which address the value should be sourced from. Notice that in this particular call we need to specify this because we are transferring value between users *within* the DamnValuableToken contract, so we need to know both parties in advance and cannot implicitly derive this from `msg.sender` . F(x) returns bool on success but should throw unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism\n>\n> `function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`\n\nThen the `poolBalance` should be incremented to reflect the updated balance after you call this function as the last step.\n\nThis is pretty weird because I don’t see any clear fallback function or anything that will manage incrementing `poolBalance` if we decide to send/transfer funds to `UnstoppableLender` through ERC20 methods rather than using this `depositTokens` wrapper. That seems weird but maybe this is a normal thing.\n\n![An image of the flashLoan function within the Unstoppable Lender smart contract](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*BdR1ZP6C_4nkoDp1QHU6Fw.png)\n\n### flashLoan\n\nThis seems to be the last stop on our journey and I’m seeing a lot of small clues being confirmed about `flashLoan` from up until this point. We could’ve guessed it was `external` or `public` since we were calling it from within our `ReceiverUnstoppable` contract, and I assumed it would be guarded against reentrancy which turns out to be a good assumption.\n\nAnd it looks like this function is taking in an `amount` argument which we could infer from the fact that we supplied an argument by this name from within `ReceiverUnstoppable` when we make the call to `executeFlashLoan`\n\nThis f(x) is giving me an odd tingly sensation in my brain as I’m scanning it, I’m pretty certain it’s just me feeling excitement that the error must be in here through some sort of process of elimination.\n\nSo we have a quick check to make sure that we aren’t trying to request a loan for zilch (although I wonder what kinda attack surface that enables), and then we get a read on how many DVT tokens our *current* contract holds by checking its state within DVT.\n\n> Sidenote: `balanceOf` is another method that can be found as part of the ERC20 standard and it’s a pretty straightforward public view function that lets us specify an address that we would like to see the quantity of tokens within the contract allocated to them\n>\n> `function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)`\n\nSo boom, we check out balance by passing in `address(this)` and make sure that the `UnstoppableLender` actually has enough tokens to fulfill their part of the obligation for the ⚡️ loan…. and **the catch is on line 36.**\n\nWe are asserting that `poolBalance` should match the reported state from `balanceBefore` — it’s really important to note here that balanceBefore is reading state directly from DVT contract while `poolBalance` is attempting to map directly to that `balanceBefore` variable. I think there are two ways I can stop the function given this line of code:\n\n1. Use `transfer` or `send` methods to send one of our 10 DVT tokens to either the DVT contract specifying that we should increase the balance for `UnstoppableLender`’s address and so `balanceBefore` shouldn’t match with `poolBalance` after we’re done.\n2. Same thing as (1) but sending DVT to `UnstoppableLender` contract directly (without using the `depositTokens` so that `poolBalance` doesn’t get incremented by value) and in this case `poolBalance` should be ahead of `balanceBefore`\n\nIn either of these two cases, our assert should fail and flash loans should no longer be possible.\n\nGoing forward, it looks like if the assertion clears then we are going to hit the DVT contract and ask it to transfer over tokens to `msg.sender` ’s address for the total borrow amount. Once that transfer is made and approved, we then call the `receiveTokens` interface with the `msg.sender` as the target to receive the tokens which are returned within the same call.\n\nOnce we make exit the `IReceiver` call then we should have received back full payment for the loan which is verified by the last two lines of the the smart contract that are checking the balance after the flash loan has been provided. If the balance hasn’t been paid back all of the changes associated with these function calls would be reverted and the gas from sender would be lost in the ether :(\n\n## Solution\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*Tvl9GB7qcqWOAwR0_6526w.png)\n\nThe exploit method snippet depicted\n\nSo this was all we had to do to solve this one. Just shoot a token to the pool.\n\n### Reflection\n\nThis was pretty fun for a first challenge. One thing that struck a personal cord for me with this one is to really reason about your safety checks and what exactly you’re trying to protect especially within functions that are making calls to potentially multiple other contracts/functions. It was kind of daunting just sitting on line 36 for a few minutes to really think about why my brain started freaking out a bit when it saw the line. I can think of a few workarounds for this one that might work, in order of my level of faith in the revision being functional:\n\n1. We change the `poolBalance` value to instead reflect `address(this).balance` , so we are always operating with the current total balance in our `UnstoppableLender` and make sure that it matches with `balanceBefore` if we absolutely \\*must \\*check to be sure that separate states are matching\n2. I probably wouldn’t even bother with trying to match a separate state within `UnstoppableLender` — as far as I can tell, we could’ve just checked to be sure `balanceBefore` wasn’t `0` and proceeded from there, but I could also be missing something in my analysis as to why we *need* to have the `poolBalance` mapping to DVT balance\n3. Write a fallback function that updates `poolBalance` anytime money is deposited into the contract. Something in my gut tells me this is bad, but I’ll have to experiment later\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThanks for sifting through this if you made it to the end. I don’t normally write out stuff like this, but I’m trying a new thing; and I would love to hear more feedback on how I can make this sort of shit more accessible and useful to others or just general improvements/critiques/comments/whatever.  \\n  \\n This is literally just a brain dump as I’m trying to learn more about this stuff and I really really appreciate any feedback or insights into what I got wrong or what I should revisit my mental model for!", "timestamp": 1633456867, "digest": "9LL3Az6SvijMw3ZmUBWK3AXZ6yR56E16uO6IZuEMkrw", "contributor": "0xA699720418F612558E2827Bf68631686e9d1095e"}

Soon after the accident, my brother was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. He couldn’t walk or talk, so my mom immediately began looking into treatments. We found hope in umbilical cord blood. The research was in its early days at the time, but there were a few inspiring stories of children with cerebral palsy who saw changes in upper body strength, vision, and coordination within just a year of an umbilical cord blood treatment. The anti-inflammatory effects of umbilical cord blood were extremely promising. Studies like those that [Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg](https://pediatrics.duke.edu/news/umbilical-cord-blood-improves-motor-skills-some-children-cerebral-palsy) was carrying out made my family bullish on umbilical cord blood and the possibilities that lie ahead. However, we couldn’t find an umbilical cord blood match for my brother. Both of us are half-Chinese and half-white, and for anyone who is not white, it is extremely difficult to find a match (matching happens by ethnicity, and most umbilical cord blood donors come from high-income areas and thus skew white). In the end, we couldn’t find a treatment for my brother.\n\nWhen my brother passed away due to pneumonia and cerebral palsy complications, it inspired me to move into the healthcare industry. Also, being a historically women’s college (Wellesley) alumna, I had a particular fervor for women’s health in particular. I found myself investigating umbilical cord blood banking, knowing that it has the potential to help many like my brother. Today, umbilical cord blood is FDA-approved to treat around 85 diseases (i.e., leukemia, solid tumors, metabolic disorders, and more), and there are approximately 1300 ongoing clinical trials investigating other use cases, even extending to possibilities like Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) treatment. In fact, [Selma Blair](https://www.usnews.com/news/entertainment/articles/2021-08-16/selma-blair-says-shes-in-remission-from-multiple-sclerosis) recently used umbilical cord blood as part of her treatment for multiple sclerosis (which is now in remission.)\n\nWanting to gauge awareness in the space, I began making [TikToks](http://tiktok.com/@kathrynanja) related to umbilical cord blood banking.\n\n![My most viewed video at 2.9M views](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YDOtexjoqUzKuDAdab1z9.png?height=1792&width=828)\n\nI quickly realized that awareness is limited. My account sky-rocketed to nearly 30k followers within 3 months, and my comments were constantly flooded with, “4 days too late” and “how come I didn’t know this was a thing.”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NgMQdl032qEeu8awKmyIe.png?height=419&width=1400)\n\nI knew I had to spread the word about umbilical cord blood banking, and I knew that I wanted to do it with a brand that is warm, approachable, and designed for and by the consumer, prioritizing user experience and accessibility. So, I created [Anja Health](http://anjahealth.com/).\n\n**What are Anja Health’s products?**\n\nAnja Health currently has 3 products — umbilical cord blood, cord tissue, and placenta banking — for 3 different types of stem cells that are collected. Anja helps our clients cryopreserve each of these easily, ensuring that they always have access to its powerful stem cells.\n\nThe first is hematopoietic stem cells, which are found in cord blood. These cells are the origin for all cells in the blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, etc. Cord blood is rich with these cells, and can treat many blood-related conditions, such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and Leukemia.\n\nThe second is mesenchymal stem cells, which are found in cord tissue. These cells are the origin for cells in the bones, cartilage, and muscle. Mesenchymal stem cells are being looked at in clinical trials to treat many organ and tissue related problems, such as diabetes, liver disease, lung cancer, and even sports injuries. An increasing number of professional athletes, such as [Kobe Bryant and Peyton Manning](https://bioinformant.com/athletes-stem-cell-treatments/), are using stem cells to treat various bone and muscle-related injuries. Mesenchymal stem cells are found in the cord tissue, hence the importance of additionally banking the umbilical cord.\n\nThe third is amniotic epithelial cells, which are found in the placenta. Their applications are still being tested in clinical trials, but currently, they are used to[ treat eye conditions and wounds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7594030/).\n\n**Why bank?**\n\nBecause of the plentiful possibilities that lie ahead with all of these stem cells, I highly recommend that parents look into banking all 3. If my family had banked all 3, we would have had enough stem cells to potentially treat my grandfather’s recent dementia and my brother’s cerebral palsy. Beyond that, we may have even had enough stem cells for my mom to receive a potential [anti-aging treatment](https://www.dvcstem.com/post/anti-aging-stem-cells). She has been healthy all of her life, but many don’t know that stem cells can be used for general potential anti-aging purposes, opening up possibilities for beauty and wellness treatments as well. Anja Health is reshaping discourse surrounding umbilical cord blood from being simply an extra precaution a few families consider to a commonplace practice families brag about.\n\nStem cell treatments from banked cord blood, tissue, and placenta stem cells can be wonderfully life-altering for sufferers of many diseases. But, today, banking is not simply an insurance policy in the low-probability case that your child gets a disease. Rather, if someone has access to stem cells and they stay up to date with its use cases as they develop (it is a part of Anja’s mission to keep our clients informed even after birth and collection) , they *will* use stem cells at some point in their life.\n\nSo, I invite you and anyone who you may know to bank with Anja.", "timestamp": 1633456318, "digest": "0YMAvPUOe9MeFeiI0St6wLCZEtmaPLiqPoQ0mUjIItI", "contributor": "0x2d172FaaA64B3CcF271901cb87a487792b78d1B1"}

Purpose of this paper**\n\nDiscussing a Standard for Metaverse Community Formation\n\nCreating an Explanatory Guidance to $GAMES Metaverse Implications\n\nGeneral Insight to Possible Investors\n\n## **3. Compartmentalizing Metaverse**\n\n**3.1. Defining current Metaverse**\n\n**3.1.1. Overarching Definition**\n\nMetaverse is the internet all around us. When you are connected to the internet with your IP address, it is your identity, similar to your physical being, where you have the ability to interact with the objects on the network. The metaverse defines the state of your internet id(IP address) in relation to its interactions to the objects(websites, protocols etc) on the networks.\n\n**Oxford Dictionary Definition:** a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.\n\nMetaverse is a playful name that is a fusion of two words. Meta and Universe. It suggests that the internet allows us to define new virtual planes of existence that are governed with different laws of *physics(metaphorically)* and these planes of existence separate from each other. However, the interesting part is, these virtual planes can *communicate* so they are connected to each other i a *meta* level.\n\n**3.1.2. Current Metaverses**\n\n**3.1.2.1. Twitter**\n\nA plane of existence where you can define an identity by a profile picture, with an arbitrary *bio(a small public summary about yourself)* and 280 character worth of information bits you provide by *tweeting* your views.\n\n**3.1.2.2 Instagram**\n\nA plane of existence where you can define an identity *by the moments you capture as a form of photographs whether it be you or other objects* and display them on your profile.\n\n**3.1.2.3. Video Games**\n\nVideo games are a bit different form of a plane of existence other than Instagram and Twitter. Video games do not only define protocols(like instagram and twitter) that allow you to use their functions in a certain way, they also define a virtual spatial environment where you can operate and navigate by vector.\n\n**3.1.2.4. Discord Servers (Emerging)**\n\nDiscord has been around since 2015 but new trends of NFT technology allows for communities to contribute to its usage of substantial functionalities(more on that later).\n\nDiscord is a plane of existence where people with the same interests come together into an online channel in the form of a *Discord Server* where they can engage with other community members. It has dissected channels for the topics that are related to the server's theme. It has excessive *emoji(a small digital image or icon used to express an idea or emotion.)* capabilities where you can customize and add your own emojis that mirrors your server's culture. The timeline of the server's channels' flow is in real time, which makes the experience substantially engaging. You can share videos, gifs, and photos. Server administrators can make announcements, organize members and launch online events all in the same plane of existence, the Discord Server.\n\nThere are also customizable automation tools in the form of *Discord Bots.* This is a whole different topic but essentially what they do is, they are introducing *customizable functionalities* that have never been seen before in any type of social media channel ever existed.\n\n**Overall Summary:** The Internet is still an emerging space that creates new ways of interfacing with other people, furthermore with reality itself.\n\n## **4. Defining a New Comprehensive Approach to Metaverse**\n\n**4.1. Community**\n\n**4.1.1. Incentives**\n\n**4.1.1.1. Introduction**\n\nTo sustain a cooperation mechanism between agents(network participants) that are going to play a fundamental part of an emergence of something like metaverse, those cooperation mechanisms should be self-sufficient. Self sufficiency couldn't be achieved by hard coded laws by *a segment of developers* because this would limit infinite possibilities of new branches\\*,\\* Instead it could be achieved by quantifiable measurable value standards that enable community members to create, capture and transform value between themselves and other protocols without limiting the interfacing metaverses' ability to set their own standards.\n\n**4.1.1.2. Metaverse Value Standard**\n\nThere should be a common denominator of value vehicles to quantify value in the metaverse for *network participants to reach an agreement with each other to assess value*. This denominator should be *interoperable, **programmable**, composable, decentralized, secure, immutable, scarce, fast, recognizable etc.* This denominator doesn't have to harbor all of the features natively, rather it can allow those features to be recreated into its function with creative approaches by its programmability. Example to this can be: to incorporate speed function to Ethereum, proposing different type of layer 2 solutions. This is possible because of Ethereum's **programmability.**\n\n*At the time of this writing, the closest thing to this is the Ethereum Ecosystem. This paper is going to present its content with a pre-conceived notion of taking Ethereum Ecosystem as the base solution to the Metaverse Standard.*\n\n**4.1.1.3. Non Fungible Tokens**\n\nNon Fungible Tokens, NFTs, are *identified objects* on the blockchain. These objects can interface with protocols therefore they are *programmable.* Their identifiability and programmability allows infinite possibilities of their usage in the virtual plane of existence that is called metaverse.\n\nNon Fungible Tokens also allow something for people to become more intuitive participants of the blockchain ecosystem. They can *choose* a digital handle as their identity. This way, they would be *known* in their community on the metaverse *by the way they choose, not the way they have given* as physical reality appoints people a certain look, race, nationality, or personal history.\n\nNon fungible tokens allow to *launch a completely new existence on the blockchain* where the new identity would be entirely what the owner of it would choose it to be.\n\n**4.1.1.4 Micro Economical Alignment of Community Members**\n\nEvery conceivable community structure is going to marginalize themselves from the others by creating a common culture while staking capital to it. The ownership of that community's culture in the form of that community's scarce NFT pieces allows a possibility to signal stake in the community in the form of capital. This is inherently different from the common practice of virtue signaling that is being observed especially in the online communities where it takes virtually no resources at all.\n\nOwnership of NFTs of an online community is entirely different from the previous online community formations. Now, the owners of NFTs have an economical stake in the community. In other words, if the community does good in the future, their early participation of the community with staked capital\n\nwill be rewarded. This will incentivize the NFT owners of the community to push the community value more and more. They would get along with other community members well. They would hold events with each other. They would signal the existence of their online tribe on other platforms etc. Social networking collapsed into microeconomics where statue indicators became quantifiable capital stakes(more on this later).\n\n**Conclusion:** Primary metaverse standard is not an arbitrary protocol structure. It is a consensus of the largest and most impactful community.\n\n**4.1.2 Adoption**\n\n**4.1.2.1. Culture**\n\n**4.1.2.1.1. Memetics**\n\n**4.1.2.1.1.1. Introduction**\n\nMemetics term was first coined by Richard Dawkins in his book: The Selfish Gene(1976). It was an analogy to genes that points out similarities of **ideas(memes)** and **genes** in their characteristic on how they self replicate themselves and propagate.\n\nInternet memes can be viewed as the second version(and a more observable one) of this phenomenon that an idea in form of a *photo, a video clip, a tweet, or a new way of expression of a word(karen, boomer, sus, fud, fomo, stonks etc.)* can have an extreme virality where too many people on the internet can adopt a new idea(a new way of thinking) in matter of days. Internet memes are mostly visual, and if they have the right characteristics, they can invoke extreme popularity with reasonable retention in people's lives. Our approach to memes is that we want to collide our visual NFTs with phenomenal characteristics of memes where we want to create a sub culture of **crypto adopters where they are going to become the active users of the protocols instead of buyers, sellers and holders.**\n\n**4.1.2.1.1.2. Story/Lore**\n\nMemes have stories behind them, and those stories create relevance. If the relevance is strong enough it invokes virality and retention. Stories have always been humanity's strong hand to create long living principles by transmitting those principles in forms of religions, myths, tales etc. Storytelling has been strong because humans comprehend concepts more easily when they are in a saturated context.\n\nOur approach to this characteristic of humans, we are going to build entertaining myths to gamify our collective metaverse community building program to make the crypto ecosystem more relevant to perception of average joe.\n\n**4.1.2.2. Usage**\n\n**4.1.2.2.1. Nurturing the community**\n\n**4.1.2.2.1.1. Lowering knowledge barrier to entry**\n\nFor something to be used, it should be understood by its users. The technology adoption gets slower the more it gets complicated. To drive adoption, taking an approach of both educating the potential users and driving the complexity down is a fertile approach.\n\nAnother approach could be, without driving the complexity down, we can educate potential users by **driving the complexity of information down to make it appealing to the general public.** This approach is also targeted towards creating an internet native approach to education. This type of education is also based on creating human native learning protocols, instead of aiming towards producing competent individuals for **particular industries' deficits(as of now what universities became/becoming).**\n\n**4.1.2.2.1.2. Use Intuition**\n\nLearning is not storing information in our memory, or recalling information when there is a relevant landscape for it.\n\nLearning is understanding something that enables you to navigate in the world by the insight incorporated that you have gotten from that experience of learning.\n\nThis does not simply by acquiring information by **reading or listening,** this only happens when engaging with the reality by the information acquired. This also builds a form of intuition\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\nOur approach is servicing a human native approach of education where we both serve information along with its use case where people practice their use on the go. This way, they unlock their **use intuition** so they can navigate in the crypto ecosystem and especially in the metaverse smoothly.\n\n**4.1.2.2.2. Economical Viability**\n\n**4.1.2.2.2.1. Introduction**\n\nThe crypto scene as most people exposed to it knows is a new financial paradigm. It introduces a decentralized more efficient approach to infinitely programmable financial transactions between parties. This enables countless ways of innovation that creates more viable approaches to the global economy in unprecedented ways. We are going to discover these in detail at the Fundamental **Building Blocks Summarized** section.\n\n**4.1.2.2.2.2. Banklesness**\n\n**4.1.2.2.2.2.1. Low Financial Barrier to Entry**\n\nYou can start financially exposing yourself starting with as low as $10 to a new economical protocol to kick start your intellectual and financial rediscovery of interfacing with the new global economic paradigm.\n\n**4.1.2.2.2.2.2. Global**\n\nYour financial exposure is, with the banklessness approach, to the whole world. This is a direct exposure to the all possibilities of financial benefits of all productivity that can be produced in the globe. This is different from being only affected by your nation's abilities of economic advancement. This does not only liberate you from your physical location's limitations, it also introduces you to all human potential that is not bound by any constitution that is set by the establishment of any kind.\n\n**4.1.2.2.2.2.3. Cheap**\n\nThis new approach introduces extreme efficiency where no establishment of any kind whether it be protocols or organizations can have a monopoly on. This means the free market is more free than ever. Since there are no monopolistic establishments that are covered **by any nation of any kind(like bailing out banks)** market efficiency drives the prices down while raising the yields up according to market needs.\n\n**4.1.2.2.2.2.4. Permission less**\n\nTo be exposed to the new global financial paradigm, you don't have to fill out forms. You don't have to provide your social security number. You don't need approval from anywhere to move value around the globe. This takes out the third parties, and any type of reinforcements on the value you hold on the blockchains.\n\n**4.1.2.2.2.2.2.5. Summary**\n\nYou can use the value you possess in any shape of form in the bankless ecosystem. This unlocks unlimited possibilities of creative ways for you to efficiently produce value in a paradigm that is only driven by pure efficiency. People adopt what is directly beneficial to them.\n\n**4.1.2.2.3. Engaging Content**\n\n**4.1.2.2.3.1. Practice Actuation**\n\nOur approach produces events that **financially** motivate its community members to practice their abilities to navigate in the metaverse.\n\n**4.1.2.2.3.2. Call To Action**\n\nMotivation of community members are proposed in forms of actionable steps by financial stake reinforcements. This is aimed towards creating a **cue, routine, reward** mechanism for community members to form valuable habits that are useful in the metaverse ecosystem.\n\n**4.1.2.2.3.3. Collective Events**\n\nAs far as individual competency enhances there also is another trait that is valuable for any given community. Harmony of community members. The harmony is easily achieved by value alignment but there is also a duration needed for people to adopt an interfacing style between each other for smooth social transactions that sets productive squads towards common goals. This is also a paramount property that a given collective is required to incorporate.\n\n**4.1.3. Gamification**\n\n**4.1.3.1. Transactional World**\n\n**4.1.3.1.1. Bounties**\n\nWould you like to outsource something small like a 30 minutes google search to someone else with the same values as the community you share around the globe? Here, put out a 3 dollar worth of a bounty and transact that amount with zero fees instantly inside the community. This also enables you to build relationships starting small that could be fruitful for bigger collaborations in the future.\n\n**4.1.3.1.2. Commissions**\n\nDescribe the job. Put the bounty. Check their previous works they have completed inside of the community and make a trustless payment with zero fees.\n\n**4.1.3.1.3. Tips**\n\nTip valuable community members: feedback, comments, contributions you like. Build reciprocate relationships.\n\n**4.1.3.1.4. Services**\n\nPurchase services from the community members. View their statue in the community by the stake they share with it and insure your satisfaction of outcome.\n\n**4.1.3.1.5. Conclusion**\n\nThe exclusive community that is governed by education, meritocracy and financial staking results in members of the community producing quality transactions that are incentivized to make valuable decisions and rise in the ranks of a value creation based collective.\n\n**4.2. Relevant Mental Models**\n\n**4.2.1 Video Game Socializing**\n\nMultiplayer video games require collaboration between players. It has been overlooked by the establishment over the years, but now we see that their practical impact in society and the new generation has this long tail effect where people are just socializing and collaborating with people all over the world for a common goal of, for example winning the round, being successful on a particular task. This is a form of a practical implication that trains people's game theoretical intuition throughout their gaming experience. Our project will produce quantifiable experiments on this mental modal in ongoing development.\n\n**4.2.2. Social Transactions**\n\nSocial transactions can be viewed as implicit transactions between humans. Good manners is a good example of this. People get to know each other by displaying a behavior that has effects on each other that builds social ties between them. The current problem is, these social transactions are extremely entropical in the society, especially in the internet, where there is no long term persistence of the community members that people can build strong relationships with each other. If there would be a mechanism that would keep like minded individuals to have persisting social transactions, it could help building thousands of persisting relationships for each individual. We will also set experiments on this and quantify these with scientific methods by quantifying them with a sociological approach.\n\n**4.2.3. Financial Stake Based Statue Signaling**\n\nThis is what NFTs do really well. People, for the first time, are able to signal their status in a quantifiable way by cashing in to the regular online communities by the way of buying its NFT. You can quantify the financial stake of an individual in a community that builds an objective view of their stake, belief, commitment by a lot of factors by blockchain based tokens. An example:\n\nSomeone bought a community NFT when it was 400 dollars, and they refuse to sell it when it is worth 30,000 dollars. This instantly signals to community members that even the person who bought the NFT too cheaply still has a strong belief in the community where they are holding onto their overtly appreciated asset. The scarce and verifiable element of NFT Tokens creates a strong social structure that is signaled through resources is a revolutionary way of aligning individuals that don't even directly know each other but they can see which individuals are more invested in a particular community because they exactly know which individual has more motivations to keep the community afloat.\n\n**4.2. Fundamental Building Blocks Summarized and Exemplified**\n\n**4.2.1. Decentralization**\n\n**4.2.1.1. Security**\n\n**4.2.1.1.1. Immutability**\n\nYour tokens' ownership cannot be altered on the blockchain. This gives you full ownership of your digital assets. Think this as Instagram cannot ban you out of your followers.\n\n**4.2.2. Transparency**\n\n**4.2.2.1. Complete Supervision**\n\nEverybody can see who has the tokens on the blockchain. This makes founders really auditable. Think this as you can see your boss' balance sheet and his profits so you can hold him accountable about why he is not giving you a raise.\n\n**4.2.2.2 Accountability**\n\nYou can only hold accountable people if you know what they are up to. Blockchain enables people to see what value they hold, once it is disclosed by the owners which is common by founders, and where they spend it and how it has turned out. It is verifiable in decentralized fashion which means you don't have to take anyone's word for it.\n\n**4.2.3. Interoperability**\n\nThe tokens on the same protocol can interface with other protocols. Think this as you can import your Twitter followers into Instagram followers.\n\n**4.2.4. Speed**\n\nYou can make instant value transactions with trusted relatively centralized layer 2 solutions that infrequently update the transactions on a base more secure protocol like Ethereum. Think this as carrying 100,000 dollars in a bank while holding 500 dollars cash in the wallet.\n\n**4.2.5. Governance**\n\n**4.2.5.1. Chosen Dictators**\n\n**4.2.5.1.1. Representation**\n\nProtocols have dictators as founders. They represent the protocol by their competency and they dictate where it goes. Think this as you like the service of Amazon and Jeff Bezos is what handles it to be as efficient as it is.\n\n**4.2.5.1.2. Optionality**\n\n**4.2.5.1.2.1. Forks**\n\nProtocol is open, if a part of community members don't like the **protocol's dictator's** way of doing stuff they can instantly copy the project and continue where they left from the tokens they hold in existence.\n\n**4.2.5.1.2.2. Snap Exit**\n\nYou don't like the metaverse formation of the current community, then you can instantly sell your tokens and navigate somewhere else. Think this as selling your stock when you lost interest in a company, or instantly moving to another country with no drawbacks.\n\n**4.2.5.2. Meritocracy**\n\nSince the protocols are driven by efficiency, the smarter the moves you can take the more power you will hold by its efficiency. Anybody in the community can instantly fund your ideas if they think it will be efficient and this will result in the efficient person holding more power in the protocol. Think of this as allocating funds to the particular senator to raise their voting and influence instantly.\n\n**4.2.5.3. Market Judged**\n\nSince the protocols are judged by markets from day one, you can view the efficiency of the protocol day by day. This forms a semi-anarchical formation where your power is not given by the establishment you have produced, it is under question everyday by the impact you have on markets. This is self evident and doesn't need an analogy.\n\n**4.2.5.4. Infinite Game Structure**\n\nCommunity members are now playing a value game between each other. They are transacting, funding, judging the value everyday. This assists building long term relationships judged by value, not statute. Think this as you can see every and each person's contribution to society from day one. This is possible via blockchains.\n\n**4.2.5.5. Rewarding Vote Mechanism**\n\nThe vote you have taken with the tokens you have provided would have a direct effect on your value in the community. Think this as the people who voted for the good policies that were beneficial to the society get quantifiable rewards proportion to their impact.\n\n## **5. Infinitely Iterated Games Formation on Metaverses**\n\n**5.1. Relevance of Game Theory**\n\nMembers of society have incentives that motivates them to collaborate with other community members. These incentives make unstable deals in short term relationships where the parties are trying to maximize the gains they can get from the given commission because they will not be dealing with the same agents in the future. This is apparently multiplied by the internet by its native entropical atomic relationships and geolocational barriers.\n\nAccording to game theory, the more a relationship is destined for the long term, the more that relationship is stable because parties are incentivized to negotiate fairly that sets a good grounds for future transactions between them.\n\nOur approach is creating a cone community where people of the internet would be able to build value based long term relationships that maximizes fair negotiations of members of the internet community by our DAO structure. Creating immutable transaction histories of community members where new participants can see the historical structure of the transactions and assess the current long term relationship formation of the given metaverse community in their decision making process on which parties they would like to cooperate that is relevant to their expectations and goals.\n\n**5.2. The Standard Games Online Community Members Play**\n\n**5.2.1. Virtue Signaling**\n\nIn online platforms, people pronounce widely recognized politically correct discourses to gain social status among their peers. It is consistently becoming a trained habit where it creates groupthink tendencies in the society that takes away individual original thinking abilities. They are constantly trying to signal their virtue that fits the contemporary view where the good portion of the society is missing the point that today's contemporary, tomorrow's ignorance.\n\nThis virtue signaling is usually dishonest and deceptive because it is easy to produce. It is easy to make just by proclaiming a particular view. If a signal is cheap to produce, there is a lot of it on the market which makes it low worth and it makes it hard to pick up in the crowd because there is too much of it.\n\nWe view this form of signaling as unproductive and useless.\n\n**5.2.2. Value Signaling**\n\nValue signaling is not that of a term which is widely used, *because there is so few of it.* Basically, anything that creates value, signals value. It is easy to pick up because it is easy to quantify. We are fond of value signaling, which has many different forms, because it sums up an objectively positive value to the parties exposed and to the overall society.\n\n**5.2.3. Zero Sum Games**\n\nStatus is a zero sum game for example. There are mostly social games and they are inherently zero sum games. To gather status value, you should win *against* someone, not win *with* someone. These games are mostly short-lived games. These types of games create contradiction more than collaboration. We need status games in the society to see who should be in charge in particular matters, but we believe climbing in the status games shouldn't happen by removing someone from their place, instead it should happen by creating more value and naturally getting to a *newly created higher rank.*\n\n**5.2.4. Positive Sum Games**\n\nPositive sum games are the best games that ever existed so far. Basically, it is a game that creates value for all *parties.* When there are positive sum games present, every participant of the game is gaining value from the game regardless of their position. The amount they gain would be proportionate to their contributions but they would gain some value anyway.\n\nTechnology is a good example of this. Antibiotics are a good invention for all society members. Cars, planes, phones, efficient ways of production etc.\n\nPositive sum games can only be sustained by the long term thinking parties because they will be interacting with a lot of different agents. This would require that all the other agents should be able to get some value out of it because first, they would keep playing it and second they would not go against it.\n\nWe are fond of these types of games driving long term human creativity and productivity that result in overall benefits for the whole society.\n\n**5.2.5. New Approach: Adding all up: Virtue, Value, Zero Sum and Positive Sum Games**\n\nOur structure enables us to signal Virtue and Value at the same time. It will also enable people to play semi-Zero Sum games as well as full positive sum games. We can simply list its features like:\n\n**5.2.5.1. Virtue Signaling & Value Signaling Mixed:**\n\nBuy the NFTs or Tokens that signal your ideas. Stake your money to the community you support. Signal your virtue with your token, signal your value by the resources you have *invested* in the community. This is a revolutionary version of producing these types of signals because, you can both be virtually included to the extensive communities you support and you can stake your resources to those communities' future success where you can also capture the upside of that success *quantifiably.*\n\n**5.2.5.2. Zero Sum and Positive Sum Games Mixed:**\n\nGet into a community of your choice and provide resources. Provide value and raise up your community's influence over time by its free market valuation. The more a community's influence increases by its value provision to the free markets the more you raise up in the ranks of quantifiable values of market judged communities. A community that collectively provides more value over a new protocol is a positive value creation. Since it is also an open source community protocol, other people can implement the same type of solutions as much as they please. This also breaks the monopolistic nature of mob culture that is enabled by the establishment around it. There would not be establishment enforced zero sum games, there would only be market valuation based individually enforced monopolies, where the monopolistic structures become more and more meritocratic instead of diplomatic.\n\nThis is a more detailed subject to discover but it is out of the scope of this whitepaper. We are going to cover this at ongoing development.\n\n# **6. Utility of $GAMES Metaverse**\n\n**6.1. Collective Consensus on Value**\n\n**6.1.1. Inherent Economical Alignment**\n\n**6.1.1.1. Introduction**\n\nOnline community tokens in the form of NFTs introduce something that previous online communities didn't have: economical alignment based on the same personal interests. What do we mean by that? When there is a community that has been kick started by an NFT collection with a theme that a particular segment of people would be interested in, they can invest in communities they would like to be a part of. For example:\n\nYou are interested in cyberpunk art and there is an online community that is launching a 10.000 pieces collection that consist of cyberpunk themed graphical NFTs. The pieces of the collection signals the taste of the community that an average human can understand more easily than buying an ERC-20 token because they are holding a partly subjectively valued piece that they can see and value based on their taste.\n\nThis enables community members to have a financial stake in the online communities they would like to be a part of and motivates them to improve its overall quality. Buying a piece of the collection also quantifies their interest in the community as well. This alignment and verifiability of someone's concern and stake of the community was harder to achieve before setting a programmable graphical token, such as an graphical(picture) NFT because the fungible tokens of communities is harder to perceive than holding a distinct token as Non-Fungible Tokens, NFTs.\n\n**6.1.1.2. Self Regulating Collective**\n\nWhen you look at the NFT holders of the online community members, you can see an obvious but not widely recognized trend. The token holders of those online communities are now financially aligned to the point they turn into a self regulating collective. What this means is, they are working for the community's success for their tokens to appreciate both internally and externally. The microeconomics principles push them to be held accountable for the community's behavior. Internally, they become more kind, more diligent and more welcoming. Externally, they promote the project, trying to recruit other members to the online community and even create content for the project without direct compensation from the founders.\n\nThese were apparent before NFTs as well, but NFTs recruit more people by their more intuitive adoption characteristics by reuniting people with the same field of interests.\n\nWe are aware of these and we are going to leverage these by creating sustainable incentives on top of these.\n\n**6.2. Collective Value Creation**\n\n**6.2.1. Investing**\n\nWhen there are aligned community members where the whole idea of this community is becoming long term members of that collective, investing turns into funds where the competent researchers shine by their track record as along with their strong connections those documented at the transactions of that particular token contract.\n\n**6.2.2. Founding**\n\nFounding becomes easier when you have reached the funds. Reaching funds becomes easier when you have been judged by a wide variety of people that share the same field of interest and value with you. Their judgement of you and your ideas also mature over time through long term games played in the community that you can get funds to your ideas overnight.\n\nAlso, long term games on the scale of the internet helps you to know who is capable of what. This enables you to co-found with the right people and recruit the talent right alongside with it.\n\n**6.2.3. Informing**\n\nThe current world structure of information on the internet is completely self motivated which means people share the information according to their goals and most of the time they manipulate the information that helps them achieve their goals as well.\n\nWhen there is a long term structure of a community, information sharing becomes more credible and more qualified because each and every contribution is going to pay dividends to the value of the community and to its provider. This better incentivized structure is superior to the usual media company structures where the incentives are towards maximizing the revenue through agitative information provision or biased views of paid advertisements.\n\n**6.2.4. Developing**\n\nPositive sum for the community members induces more development. More development induces more positive sum for the community. The long term structure of a community introduces exponential scalability of the development of any kind of innovative concept.\n\n**6.2.5. Building Long Term Relationships**\n\nBuilding long term relationships to *scale* our **Infinitely Iterated Games** structure is what we are focused on. We believe that when the people, agents, and different parties align for the long term collaboration, the improvement of efficiency comes naturally. This is already proven in the global markets over and over again. What we are focused on is creating a *scaled* way of Infinitely Iterated games through our and other online communities where we can bring quantifiable positive sum games to the whole scale of the internet. We believe the entropical structure and information based internet attention economy can be structured into lifelong games through metaverses. The whole point of ours is, building a protocol that enables human creativity and collaboration on a mass scale.\n\nWe believe this takes a multi disciplinary approach that comes to life by **iterations** by collective effort to create aligned incentives, values, standards for its participants, meanwhile not monopolizing the structure as Facebook, Twitter or other metaverse like landscapes did. We want to create an open protocol that the beneficiaries of this structure would be anybody who would be part of its structure in their own choice of exposure. This doesn't mean we don't want to capture the value for ourselves as well. This means that as we believe in positive sum games, this approach would create more value for **us** and the **others** alike compared to keeping a walled garden as traditional company structures are formed which also creates contradictions of resource allocation struggles.\n\nLet's win and make others win within.\n\n**6.3. Collective Sovereignty**\n\n**6.3.1. Total Legitimacy**\n\nWhen it is carefully scrutinized, what we are offering is a cloud state-like formation that has capable leaders with meritocratic participants around them. What renders the legitimacy of those leaders, first their competency is judged directly by the market structures, second you can change your cloud state/DAO structured online community in an instant instead of a regular state you live in by selling your stake in the community and leaving it for good.\n\nThis renders the choice of the cloud state %100 legitimate by the vote amount rather than a regular democracy in which the leaders are rendered legitimate by little over half of the population.\n\nThis makes community members more sovereign by extreme optionality.\n\n**6.3.2. Social Safeguard**\n\nWe all are introduced to the mob rule of the internet culture. Partisanship mongering media companies enrages the internet mobs to gang up on people on the internet because they disagree with a notion some groupthink formations share.\n\nLong term aligned internet relationships can safeguard these individuals against the chaotic mobs that form in a day and scatter purposelessly. This introduces more sovereignty to the individual as much as the online community itself.\n\nThe weak currency of enragement that the scaled mobs share replaced with long term formulated long term collectives.\n\n**6.4. Collective Financial Value**\n\n**6.4.1. Bulk Negotiations**\n\n**6.4.1.1. Purchases**\n\nThink about a community that makes financial decisions with each other. This opens a possibility for them to make cooperative financial purchases together. For example: Think about how you want to buy a subscription and it is 20 dollars a month. And you have a community that has 10.000 members in it and 1000 of them have already bought into that subscription. You can easily negotiate with the company by cooperating with the long term community members to drive the prices down by let's say %30. You instantly saved 6000 dollars a month collectively, just by one bulk purchase. You can fund a project in the community, practically for free, and take a shot for advancement of the community as well as making an upside along with it.\n\n**6.4.1.2. Other Possibilities**\n\nBulk negotiations create a lot of possibilities that sovereign communities can leverage its efficiencies. We are going to develop different solutions in this area. Some examples could be: Insurance Packages, Legal deals with governments, provision of airbnb like living spaces for all around the world, mobility solutions for nomads etc.\n\nThis is a really exciting way of producing yield just by leveraging a community's power without effort. More on that in later papers.\n\n**6.5. Wisdom of Crowds**\n\nCollective opinion of a group of individuals proven to be better than a single expert when it is judged by the free mechanism like free markets.\n\nWisdom of crowds in markets is already a good mechanism of judgement, but imagine that collective wisdom when it is leveraged by cone culture that pushes those individuals' members to be more meritocratic, efficient and prudent.\n\n## **What's next?**\n\nHere, our first whitepaper version 1.0 is finished.

{"id": "xIWs5VdYTbGol4uJN-nlpij9QZpkl762CQ5O1bx1TYY", "title": "Damn Vulnerable DeFi: Unstoppable ", "body": "*Warning: Solution to the challenge will be discussed here. Also note, I could be totally fucking wrong about everything I’m about to write. This is mostly just me long form “tweeting into the ether” about my smart contract journey. Proceed with caution.*\n\n## Problem\n\n> There’s a lending pool with a million DVT tokens in balance, offering flash loans for free.\n>\n> If only there was a way to attack and stop the pool from offering flash loans …\n>\n> You start with 100 DVT tokens in balance.\n\nSo from jump, this particular problem is pretty clear that we don’t need to necessarily try to drain the contract or anything but just stop it from offering flash loans. I’m not really sure how that’s done without bankrupting the contract, so let’s take a look at the code…\n\n![An image of the ReceiverUnstoppable smart contract](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*LLLk4rIwn8png7hIBganwA.png)\n\nChecking out the Receiver contract for the flash loan and I’m not noticing anything too wonky here…\n\n### constructor\n\nHere we just set the `owner` of the contract to match the address that deployed the contract initially as well as set the `pool` (of type `UnstoppableLender`) to point to the contract we’re hoping to freeze. Nothing special to see here (or is there?).\n\n### receiveTokens\n\nThis is an external function meant to be called by `UnstoppableLender` in order to move tokens to the `ReceiverUnstoppable` , specifying two arguments the `tokenAddress` which is basically the address of the contract holding the state for a particular ERC20 that we are trying to transfer to `Receiver` , and an `amount` that details exactly how many tokens we should be sending.\n\nFrom the first line of this function, we see that in order for this function to not revert, the address that called this particular function must have come from the `pool` variable we set up in the constructor.\n\n> Sidenote: the `transfer` method is a method that looks like this for any ERC20, where we can move value from the contract to whichever address we specify `_to` with an appropriate `_value` and returns a `bool` indicating if the call was successful or not.\n>\n> `function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`\n\nAfter we satisfy the first condition, we move onto the second requirement that casts the ERC20 standard over the provided `tokenAddress` in the arguments (to ensure we have access to that `transfer` f(x) you see up there).\n\nSo this seems to be pretty on par with a flash loan recipients’ obligations to their lender. As long as we’re getting tokens from the DVT pool and then sending them back at the end all of the state changes we attempt with this flash loan should be accepted.\n\n### executeFlashLoan\n\nSo this looks like a f(x) that’s meant to be called by the `owner` of the `ReceiverUnstoppable` contract that was set in the constructor and it only expects an `amount` to request in the form of a flash loan. The final line of this function appears to call on the `pool` object that’s pointing at the DVT contract to make a request for some ⚡️ loans.\n\n![An image of the UnstoppableLender smart contract](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*23UjvYDiRhw12-8GccQyQA.png)\n\nI’m seeing a lot of OpenZeppelin standards at the top which gives me very little faith that I’ll be draining this contract completely. I’m pretty new to this but typically seeing these libraries means I’m not gonna be able to rely on [reentrancy](https://medium.com/coinmonks/protect-your-solidity-smart-contracts-from-reentrancy-attacks-9972c3af7c21) or [arithmetic bs](https://medium.com/coinmonks/math-in-solidity-part-2-overflow-3cd7283714b4) here. There doesn’t seem to be anything about ownership of contract though… 🧐\n\nI’m also noticing that this contract seems to have an interface for the `receiveTokens` f(x) that’s written out in our other contract of concern for this challenge.\n\n### constructor\n\nSo a few things, we’re using SafeMath to manage arithmetic and try to stop overflows, so it’s not likely that we’ll be able to fuck off `poolBalance` which is of type uint256, and then we have public access to the DamnValuableToken ERC20 implementation as well as the poolBalance that seems pretty well guarded although visible.\n\nHere, we just want to provide a token address that should point to the location of the DamnValuableToken ERC20 implementation and make sure it’s not pointing to the null address `address(0)` at which point we point our DamnValuableToken at the `tokenAddress` provided by `msg.sender` when they deployed the function.\n\n### depositTokens\n\nSomething about the use of a wrapper deposit function instead of using native functions within ERC20 standard feels intuitively off to me, but I’m also pretty ignorant as to what current best practices are for most shit like this right now. But this particular wrapper is expecting an `amount` to be provided by the address that calls this function and we are doing a check immediately to make sure that `msg.sender` isn’t calling this with zero tokens to deposit.\n\n> Sidenote: the `transferFrom` method is again part of the ERC20 standard, that differentiates from the previously inspected `transfer` only in that we are not explicitly deciding which address the value should be sourced from. Notice that in this particular call we need to specify this because we are transferring value between users *within* the DamnValuableToken contract, so we need to know both parties in advance and cannot implicitly derive this from `msg.sender` . F(x) returns bool on success but should throw unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism\n>\n> `function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`\n\nThen the `poolBalance` should be incremented to reflect the updated balance after you call this function as the last step.\n\nThis is pretty weird because I don’t see any clear fallback function or anything that will manage incrementing `poolBalance` if we decide to send/transfer funds to `UnstoppableLender` through ERC20 methods rather than using this `depositTokens` wrapper. That seems weird but maybe this is a normal thing.\n\n![An image of the flashLoan function within the Unstoppable Lender smart contract](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*BdR1ZP6C_4nkoDp1QHU6Fw.png)\n\n### flashLoan\n\nThis seems to be the last stop on our journey and I’m seeing a lot of small clues being confirmed about `flashLoan` from up until this point. We could’ve guessed it was `external` or `public` since we were calling it from within our `ReceiverUnstoppable` contract, and I assumed it would be guarded against reentrancy which turns out to be a good assumption.\n\nAnd it looks like this function is taking in an `amount` argument which we could infer from the fact that we supplied an argument by this name from within `ReceiverUnstoppable` when we make the call to `executeFlashLoan`\n\nThis f(x) is giving me an odd tingly sensation in my brain as I’m scanning it, I’m pretty certain it’s just me feeling excitement that the error must be in here through some sort of process of elimination.\n\nSo we have a quick check to make sure that we aren’t trying to request a loan for zilch (although I wonder what kinda attack surface that enables), and then we get a read on how many DVT tokens our *current* contract holds by checking its state within DVT.\n\n> Sidenote: `balanceOf` is another method that can be found as part of the ERC20 standard and it’s a pretty straightforward public view function that lets us specify an address that we would like to see the quantity of tokens within the contract allocated to them\n>\n> `function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)`\n\nSo boom, we check out balance by passing in `address(this)` and make sure that the `UnstoppableLender` actually has enough tokens to fulfill their part of the obligation for the ⚡️ loan…. and **the catch is on line 36.**\n\nWe are asserting that `poolBalance` should match the reported state from `balanceBefore` — it’s really important to note here that balanceBefore is reading state directly from DVT contract while `poolBalance` is attempting to map directly to that `balanceBefore` variable. I think there are two ways I can stop the function given this line of code:\n\n1. Use `transfer` or `send` methods to send one of our 10 DVT tokens to either the DVT contract specifying that we should increase the balance for `UnstoppableLender`’s address and so `balanceBefore` shouldn’t match with `poolBalance` after we’re done.\n2. Same thing as (1) but sending DVT to `UnstoppableLender` contract directly (without using the `depositTokens` so that `poolBalance` doesn’t get incremented by value) and in this case `poolBalance` should be ahead of `balanceBefore`\n\nIn either of these two cases, our assert should fail and flash loans should no longer be possible.\n\nGoing forward, it looks like if the assertion clears then we are going to hit the DVT contract and ask it to transfer over tokens to `msg.sender` ’s address for the total borrow amount. Once that transfer is made and approved, we then call the `receiveTokens` interface with the `msg.sender` as the target to receive the tokens which are returned within the same call.\n\nOnce we make exit the `IReceiver` call then we should have received back full payment for the loan which is verified by the last two lines of the the smart contract that are checking the balance after the flash loan has been provided. If the balance hasn’t been paid back all of the changes associated with these function calls would be reverted and the gas from sender would be lost in the ether :(\n\n## Solution\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*Tvl9GB7qcqWOAwR0_6526w.png)\n\nThe exploit method snippet depicted\n\nSo this was all we had to do to solve this one. Just shoot a token to the pool.\n\n### Reflection\n\nThis was pretty fun for a first challenge. One thing that struck a personal cord for me with this one is to really reason about your safety checks and what exactly you’re trying to protect especially within functions that are making calls to potentially multiple other contracts/functions. It was kind of daunting just sitting on line 36 for a few minutes to really think about why my brain started freaking out a bit when it saw the line. I can think of a few workarounds for this one that might work, in order of my level of faith in the revision being functional:\n\n1. We change the `poolBalance` value to instead reflect `address(this).balance` , so we are always operating with the current total balance in our `UnstoppableLender` and make sure that it matches with `balanceBefore` if we absolutely \\*must \\*check to be sure that separate states are matching\n2. I probably wouldn’t even bother with trying to match a separate state within `UnstoppableLender` — as far as I can tell, we could’ve just checked to be sure `balanceBefore` wasn’t `0` and proceeded from there, but I could also be missing something in my analysis as to why we *need* to have the `poolBalance` mapping to DVT balance\n3. Write a fallback function that updates `poolBalance` anytime money is deposited into the contract. Something in my gut tells me this is bad, but I’ll have to experiment later\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThanks for sifting through this if you made it to the end. I don’t normally write out stuff like this, but I’m trying a new thing; and I would love to hear more feedback on how I can make this sort of shit more accessible and useful to others or just general improvements/critiques/comments/whatever.  \\n  \\n This is literally just a brain dump as I’m trying to learn more about this stuff and I really really appreciate any feedback or insights into what I got wrong or what I should revisit my mental model for!", "timestamp": 1633456854, "digest": "_MPu7jyrYQt7B4reYkYazDWcIEStCv1o3tIjreQO4T4", "contributor": "0xA699720418F612558E2827Bf68631686e9d1095e"}

Soon after the accident, my brother was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. He couldn’t walk or talk, so my mom immediately began looking into treatments. We found hope in umbilical cord blood. The research was in its early days at the time, but there were a few inspiring stories of children with cerebral palsy who saw changes in upper body strength, vision, and coordination within just a year of an umbilical cord blood treatment. The anti-inflammatory effects of umbilical cord blood were extremely promising. Studies like those that [Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg](https://pediatrics.duke.edu/news/umbilical-cord-blood-improves-motor-skills-some-children-cerebral-palsy) was carrying out made my family bullish on umbilical cord blood and the possibilities that lie ahead. However, we couldn’t find an umbilical cord blood match for my brother. Both of us are half-Chinese and half-white, and for anyone who is not white, it is extremely difficult to find a match (matching happens by ethnicity, and most umbilical cord blood donors come from high-income areas and thus skew white). In the end, we couldn’t find a treatment for my brother.\n\nWhen my brother passed away due to pneumonia and cerebral palsy complications, it inspired me to move into the healthcare industry. Also, being a historically women’s college (Wellesley) alumna, I had a particular fervor for women’s health in particular. I found myself investigating umbilical cord blood banking, knowing that it has the potential to help many like my brother. Today, umbilical cord blood is FDA-approved to treat around 85 diseases (i.e., leukemia, solid tumors, metabolic disorders, and more), and there are approximately 1300 ongoing clinical trials investigating other use cases, even extending to possibilities like Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) treatment. In fact, [Selma Blair](https://www.usnews.com/news/entertainment/articles/2021-08-16/selma-blair-says-shes-in-remission-from-multiple-sclerosis) recently used umbilical cord blood as part of her treatment for multiple sclerosis (which is now in remission.)\n\nWanting to gauge awareness in the space, I began making [TikToks](http://tiktok.com/@kathrynanja) related to umbilical cord blood banking.\n\n![My most viewed video at 2.9M views](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YDOtexjoqUzKuDAdab1z9.png?height=1792&width=828)\n\nI quickly realized that awareness is limited. My account sky-rocketed to nearly 30k followers within 3 months, and my comments were constantly flooded with, “4 days too late” and “how come I didn’t know this was a thing.”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NgMQdl032qEeu8awKmyIe.png?height=419&width=1400)\n\nI knew I had to spread the word about umbilical cord blood banking, and I knew that I wanted to do it with a brand that is warm, approachable, and designed for and by the consumer, prioritizing user experience and accessibility. So, I created [Anja Health](http://anjahealth.com/).\n\n**What are Anja Health’s products?**\n\nAnja Health currently has 3 products — umbilical cord blood, cord tissue, and placenta banking — for 3 different types of stem cells that are collected. Anja helps our clients cryopreserve each of these easily, ensuring that they always have access to its powerful stem cells.\n\nThe first is hematopoietic stem cells, which are found in cord blood. These cells are the origin for all cells in the blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, etc. Cord blood is rich with these cells, and can treat many blood-related conditions, such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and Leukemia.\n\nThe second is mesenchymal stem cells, which are found in cord tissue. These cells are the origin for cells in the bones, cartilage, and muscle. Mesenchymal stem cells are being looked at in clinical trials to treat many organ and tissue related problems, such as diabetes, liver disease, lung cancer, and even sports injuries. An increasing number of professional athletes, such as [Kobe Bryant and Peyton Manning](https://bioinformant.com/athletes-stem-cell-treatments/), are using stem cells to treat various bone and muscle-related injuries. Mesenchymal stem cells are found in the cord tissue, hence the importance of additionally banking the umbilical cord.\n\nThe third is amniotic epithelial cells, which are found in the placenta. Their applications are still being tested in clinical trials, but currently, they are used to[ treat eye conditions and wounds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7594030/).\n\n**Why bank?**\n\nBecause of the plentiful possibilities that lie ahead with all of these stem cells, I highly recommend that parents look into banking all 3. If my family had banked all 3, we would have had enough stem cells to potentially treat my grandfather’s recent dementia and my brother’s cerebral palsy. Beyond that, we may have even had enough stem cells for my mom to receive a potential [anti-aging treatment](https://www.dvcstem.com/post/anti-aging-stem-cells). She has been healthy all of her life, but many don’t know that stem cells can be used for general potential anti-aging purposes, opening up possibilities for beauty and wellness treatments as well. Anja Health is reshaping discourse surrounding umbilical cord blood from being simply an extra precaution a few families consider to a commonplace practice families brag about.\n\nStem cell treatments from banked cord blood, tissue, and placenta stem cells can be wonderfully life-altering for sufferers of many diseases. But, today, banking is not simply an insurance policy in the low-probability case that your child gets a disease. Rather, if someone has access to stem cells and they stay up to date with its use cases as they develop (it is a part of Anja’s mission to keep our clients informed even after birth and collection) , they *will* use stem cells at some point in their life.\n\nSo, I invite you and anyone who you may know to bank with Anja.", "timestamp": 1633456318, "digest": "0YMAvPUOe9MeFeiI0St6wLCZEtmaPLiqPoQ0mUjIItI", "contributor": "0x2d172FaaA64B3CcF271901cb87a487792b78d1B1"}

You can just see how much conviction he had about the internet and e-commerce even in 1994.\n\nIn 1994, the internet looked like this:\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa98870ce-8e99-4701-a296-f157be955699\\_480x467.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa98870ce-8e99-4701-a296-f157be955699\\_480x467.png)\n\nMy eyes, they are melting…\n\nThis was the amazon.com homepage back when launched. This is how early an adopter Jeff Bezos was to wanting to build a company online in e-commerce. There was no Shopify, there was no 3rd party logistics, no FBA, etc.\n\nBut the data didn’t lie. He saw the adoption of the internet. And it was game-changing. He had a thesis of the future.\n\nHe was working as a hedge fund analyst at DE Shaw and saw the adoption rate of the internet, it floored him, he couldn’t believe it… And had to jump into it, give it his shot, to make sure he didn’t regret it.\n\nhis Regret minimization framework.\n\nSo… He quit his high-paying job to start an e-commerce company before it was even feasible.\n\nHe knew people would just want a better way to buy stuff, more convenient and easier.\n\nAnd he has changed the world.. I can go on my computer like I did last night.. Compare some products, read reviews, and made a fairly large purchase in 2 minutes.\n\nThat’s what he envisioned.\n\nIt just took a long time to nail down the logistics since that’s in the real physical world.. That’s the hard stuff.\n\nAnd it has caught up, it’s amazing… That I can get an item in 2 hours now.\n\n## The Wedge Theory\n\nThey talk about Bezos' wedge, and how new companies can gain a foothold into a bigger market, he used books as his wedge into a huge new market, a beachhead, a toe hold if you will.\n\nHe knew books were not the biggest category he could get into, but… it had a unique market. Since there were 3 million different books / SKUs at the time, so the product options were the highest of any category.\n\nA store could never carry 3 million books. Retail space just doesn’t have room.\n\nSo logically the internet made books a great first beachhead product.\n\nThen CDs and movies were the next categories with huge individual product numbers / SKUs.\n\nSo those naturally flowed into it.\n\nSo by him looking at what products lent themselves to e-commerce AT THAT TIME… was he able to get good traction and build the foundation to then be able to become Walmart online.\n\nBecome a department store online.\n\nThen allow 3rd parties to use his brilliant infrastructure.\n\nRest is history.\n\n## Being Jeff Bezos?\n\n[![Being John Malkovich - Humane Hollywood](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea255329-0cbd-4bfa-adfd-feee7120c083\\_235x353.jpeg \"Being John Malkovich - Humane Hollywood\")](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea255329-0cbd-4bfa-adfd-feee7120c083\\_235x353.jpeg)\n\nThe recent article Crypto Bezos is fascinating and amazing since it’s trying to get into Bezos's head back in the mid-1990s to understand what he might look like as an opportunity now.\n\nSince there are many parallels to the internet boom of the 90s and the crypto / web3 boom we are just starting to see now.\n\nThe videos of people laughing him off on 60 minutes and quite frankly making fun of his cheap little empire, made me laugh at how society usually is either confused or pokes fun at new things or toys and the oddballs/nerds that understand them and are excited by them.\n\nTHIS IS NOW.\n\nThis is web3 tech, people are still laughing at it.\n\n## web3, Crypto, and Blockchain are still very early and the powers to change the world are not fully embraced\n\nCrypto is still \"nerdy\" and a “toy” and mocked by boomers…\n\nMainstream financial and business leads still are confused and laughing at some of the odd behavior that is not their \"normal\".\n\nWe are on the verge of this next technological shift and boom.\n\nWeb 2.0 the social web, absolutely changed how society functions. Social media has changed everything.\n\nWeb3 is a total rewiring of so many institutions and how business can get done.\n\nIt’s a streamlining of so many things that are cumbersome and clunky now.\n\nIt’s a digitizing of the physical world quite frankly.\n\nIt’s the digitizing of those colored pieces of paper in your pocket that you exchange for goods and services.\n\nIt’s going to unlock how our world works in fascinating ways.\n\nIt’s more than just a worldwide currency, the blockchain is the key, that will transform almost every industry.\n\nEspecially the older slower-moving ones.\n\nAll the gatekeepers and intermediaries that skim so much money off the top of the world economy, will wither and die eventually.\n\nIn web3, they slowly will die.\n\nGranted some will adapt and utilize further technology to be relevant, but their business models will be forced to change in a big way.\n\n## How can you make the customer’s life so much easier, faster, and cheaper?\n\nFor me, like Bezos, I am trying to look at what would best benefit the consumer.\n\nHow can we make the customer/consumer’s life easier and simpler?\n\nAmazon.com has made life fundamentally better for people who want to buy most anything but especially physical stuff.\n\nIt allowed both the internet and a huge logistics dream, to let people order almost anything, at any time, anywhere, and get it in like 2 hours on their doorstep.\n\nThis is sci-fi in real life.\n\nAnd I want to take a brief pause here… and ask you to all think about how amazing technology has made your life.\n\nSure there are major downsides, and some things have been very negatively affected by technology, but on the whole, we have some absolutely magical new ways of living that make life better for us.\n\nRealize you should be as giddy as Bezos was when talking about how amazing life will get in even 10 years.\n\nWe can summon a personal chauffeur anytime anywhere in an instant with one touch on our glass screen in our pockets.\n\nWe can order anything in the entire world, and get it sent to our home in hardly any time… By touching the glass computer in our pocket.\n\nWe can chat with anyone in the world via a video call at any time, instantly.\n\nWe are living through vivid sci-fi, and I sure as hell hope you are grateful and stop letting it become \"normal\" I didn’t grow up with this stuff… So I know times before these amazing new advances.\n\nSo the crux of the thinking here is what is going to be the most impactful way you can make customers’ lives better with blockchain?\n\nThis is the mindset to get into.\n\nWhat things are still so broken and cumbersome now?\n\nLike having to go down to Borders and ask a store clerk what section for a particular book, only to find they don’t have it in stock… was frustrating and cumbersome and just how it was.\n\nWhat industries need a reboot that is vitally important?\n\nOne industry and category that I cannot help but gravitate towards as an opportunity to change is real estate and mortgages.\n\n## Why Real Estate is the prettiest at the Blockchain Ball\n\nReal estate is a 280 trillion dollar asset class, it’s the largest asset class in the world, were talking about all the physical world. Land, homes, apartments, retail centers, industrial, self-storage, every physical property.\n\nAnd it’s incredibly broken and inefficient at every single turn.\n\nMy whole career has been in real estate private equity and development so I have lived through the pain in this industry.\n\nIts BROOOOOKEEENNNNNNN.\n\nSo many layers and intermediaries that siphon off so many fees and profits and bleed people dry. Make processes take months and years instead of minutes and hours.\n\nI've never seen anything riper for a revolution.\n\nAnd, what's a typical consumer’s most important and biggest asset/transaction they make in life??? Real estate. Typically buying a home.\n\nSo not only is real estate the world’s biggest asset class by far, it’s also the average consumer’s biggest purchase, their biggest expense in life and It holds most of their wealth… It’s an extremely important industry and category.\n\nIts TAM would make even Softbank's head explode…\n\n[![8 mind-blowing Tweets that will make your head hurt – can you work them out?](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce875209-b2eb-441e-be20-53ddae9367a2\\_615x308.gif \"8 mind-blowing Tweets that will make your head hurt – can you work them out?\")](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce875209-b2eb-441e-be20-53ddae9367a2\\_615x308.gif)\n\nIt’s just so freaking important in so many ways.\n\nAnd yet, it’s so cumbersome, so annoying, so not easy, such a bad aggravating frustrating anxiety-filled experience for the customer now!\n\nSo….. like having to drive down to a huge store, spend 20 minutes navigating aisles, pushing a cart, asking a clerk where a certain product might be… Walking all around a huge store, only to find they are out of stock.\n\nThen waiting in line forever to buy a few other things you needed and driving back home.\n\nIt’s a trip to the mall vs a 2-hour amazon delivery to your home.\n\nReal estate in 2021 is a trip to Mall, then through a dark, dank department store, through into the mall, then finally into your specific store in the 1990s.\n\nBezos saw that the customer experience was SHITTY. He himself could identify, he was a customer. He experienced how things were done then.\n\nHe saw how the internet could transform this bad experience into something magically easy and much better.\n\n## Potential Crypto / web3 Real Estate Revolutions\n\nI foresee the biggest impact that web3 could have is on the entire real estate ecosystem.\n\n*   Mortgages and loans\n*   Fannie Mae and Freddie mac\n*   CMBS - revolution into commercial mortgage-backed tokens\n*   Tokenization of homes\n*   Tokenization of every single physical property asset on the planet\n*   Title work and history moving to the blockchain\n*   Surveys and legal physical reports can and is being digitized via GPS etc\n*   Investing in commercial assets as tokens and fractional shares\n*   Environmental reports and records\n*   Zoning laws and entitlements can and will be digitized and straightforward\n*   Property management\n*   Development\n*   Purchase and sale contracts\n\n>\n\nEach item has even more subcategories that all need disrupting.\n\nThis is not the job for one company like amazon, but many, many new companies will pick off certain aspects of this problem to solve in unique ways, and they will all be sort of Legos built on top of the blockchain.\n\nEach new advance will make other advances more relevant.\n\nIf you solve title work, it makes so many other things easier.\n\nIf you solve purchase and sale contracts, it streamlines so much.\n\nThere is exponential growth once each item is better handled by a new way of doing it.\n\nAs many in web3 / crypto are fond of saying, it’s actually the combination of these new legos that makes for a much better end process for the consumers, and the specific legos themselves.\n\nThe value adds will be how people can combine these streamlined pieces to make the overall process easier and simpler and fast and better.\n\n## Jeffy from the Block\n\n[![Why does the mysterious Defi whale reproduce an identical version of  Cryptopunk NFT?](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F119c2bca-703f-480f-b568-0f8702b67e5a\\_225x225.png \"Why does the mysterious Defi whale reproduce an identical version of  Cryptopunk NFT?\")](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F119c2bca-703f-480f-b568-0f8702b67e5a\\_225x225.png)\n\nIf Bezos were looking at what ways can you make a customer’s experience simpler, and what will the web3 / blockchain help to make so much better, real estate is one of my top industries that he would go into.\n\nFinance and DeFi is the big shift happening now, and real estate is tied in pretty close with finance, it’s the largest asset class in the world.\n\nThis feels like it has synergies with many of the innovative fintech firms sprouting up with crypto / web3 tendencies.\n\nBezos would be in nerdvana, nerding out on how insane this opportunity is, and he would be laughing like he was in his 1990s.\n\nLaughing… all the way to the crypto wallet…\n", "timestamp": 1633456954, "digest": "LH20UpiY_ATrYjM8ccrNRy2J8i0Usf-zuYCvuHic2mQ", "contributor": "0x089795A2e2e3D8a8500ca5F820ed4bCa6Bab75EB"}

This is how early an adopter Jeff Bezos was to wanting to build a company online in e-commerce. There was no Shopify, there was no 3rd party logistics, no FBA, etc.\n\nBut the data didn’t lie. He saw the adoption of the internet. And it was game-changing. He had a thesis of the future.\n\nHe was working as a hedge fund analyst at DE Shaw and saw the adoption rate of the internet, it floored him, he couldn’t believe it… And had to jump into it, give it his shot, to make sure he didn’t regret it.\n\nhis Regret minimization framework.\n\nSo… He quit his high-paying job to start an e-commerce company before it was even feasible.\n\nHe knew people would just want a better way to buy stuff, more convenient and easier.\n\nAnd he has changed the world.. I can go on my computer like I did last night.. Compare some products, read reviews, and made a fairly large purchase in 2 minutes.\n\nThat’s what he envisioned.\n\nIt just took a long time to nail down the logistics since that’s in the real physical world.. That’s the hard stuff.\n\nAnd it has caught up, it’s amazing… That I can get an item in 2 hours now.\n\n## The Wedge Theory\n\nThey talk about Bezos' wedge, and how new companies can gain a foothold into a bigger market, he used books as his wedge into a huge new market, a beachhead, a toe hold if you will.\n\nHe knew books were not the biggest category he could get into, but… it had a unique market.

And should it be welcomed? My gut feeling is a resounding yes! Only money, time and monitoring data will tell. Space travel offers us a promising and potentially carbon reduced future; not to mention, all of the technological innovations that will undoubtedly be birthed in the process.\n\nHowever, we really should address the rocket-sized elephant in the room.\n\n## Rocket Emissions\n\nWe have recently been inundated with news coverage of commercial human space flight. Sir Richard Branson (Virgin Galactic) and Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) conducted what has got to be one of the most expensive product demos in recent history. They kicked off a new aviation industry niche called Space Tourism.\n\nA cursory look at news headlines or listening to Joe Public at your local pub, one could be forgiven for thinking that these space rockets were single-handedly going to destroy the earth. Despite what you may have read or heard, the total number of rockes emissions, globally, is miniscule in comparison to other modes of transport.\n\n![Global rocket emissions (2019)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*lKteL7t3yiEfViGd_VWXeg.png)\n\nHowever, this does not mean the Space Tourism industry should be left unchecked. As rocket launches increase, emissions will increase and the effects of CO2 and N2O in the stratosphere have a different kind of environmental effect. We should take this opportunity to champion a new form of travel whilst implementing the appropriate environmental safeguards.\n\n*If you want to learn more about the details behind rocket emissions, check out my appendix article —*[\\* \\*](https://medium.com/@darryll.colthrust/what-is-the-effect-of-the-virgin-galactic-flight-abc02a02cef0)***[What is the effect of the Virgin Galactic Flight?](https://medium.com/@darryll.colthrust/what-is-the-effect-of-the-virgin-galactic-flight-abc02a02cef0)***\n\n## Space Tourism\n\nJuly 2021 will be a historic month. It was the first marker in a new, “new” age of commercial space tourism and potentially space travel. Space. A destination that 99% of the world’s population didn’t think was in contention until billionaire’s started trolling each other over the Karman Line, suborbital vs orbital flight and asterisks.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Fc6QtUa6eD45TR6dp1oVlA.png)\n\nThe flights were brilliant product demos. In no uncertain terms, Space tourism is going to be an ultra luxury recreational activity. I’m sure there is going to be a Zero G & space craze. Space Hotels, Zero G dinners, parties, space walks, etc… It is a $5Bn niche segment of the aviation industry for the 1% and aspiring.\n\nIt is not space travel. You are not going to another physical location to disembark, yet. Its main purpose is recreation. It will be one of the most expensive 10min (Blue Origin) or 2hr (Virgin Galactic) fairground rides that 99% of the world’s population won’t be enjoying anytime soon. For most, the dream of going into space will only be realised through years of astronaut training or winning a golden ticket.\n\nThe allure of going into space, even for a few minutes of weightlessness should not be underestimated, nor should the extreme exhilaration of experiencing the world from a completely unique perspective. Given the means, I would happily join the queue of 600+ future passengers who have already signed up and paid between $250k.\n\nWhilst I’m laying it all out there, I would also choose the Blue Origin experience. At a similar ticket price, the $/min experience is extorniate, BUT, IT’S A FREAKING ROCKET!!!\n\n## Space Travel is VERY different to Space Tourism\n\nFor the purposes of this article, let’s call space travel, any form of orbital flight. Orbital being anything that leaves Earth’s atmosphere and can remain in space whilst the earth rotates. Space Tourism vessels do not remain in space.\n\nIt is only in recent history we have been able to start building reusable rockets, thus making Space Travel a possibility. Yes, I know the Space Shuttle was partially reusable, but at $211Bn to build with a $576m price tag per launch, it wasn’t cheap.\n\nIn modernish history, prior to commercial airlines, the only way to travel or transport goods long distance, en masse, was by sea or land. We are nearing the point where we have the technology to include space as another medium.\n\nImagine a world where a payload (human or cargo) could get anywhere on earth in less than an hour…and I mean ANYWHERE. Live in London, work in New York. Your commute home will be faster, and a lot more pleasant than current public or private transport. Humanitarian aid would be transformed. Food and infrastructure relief to emergency disaster areas in less than an hour! That would be an amazing sight and a reality I would wholeheartedly welcome.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqE-ultsWt0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqE-ultsWt0)\n\nSpaceX Starship: Travel anywhere on Earth in less than an hour.\n\nThe appropriate inter-governmental environmental policies would, of course, have to be put in place:\n\n* **All rockets are fully reusable**. Build once, use many times. This reduces the rocket launch and manufacturing carbon footprint.\n* **All rocket fuel is environmentally friendly**.\n* **Climate-positive rocket production. Not merely Carbon-neutral. Offsetting isn’t enough and doesn’t change behaviours.**\n* **Open technology and active knowledge sharing**\n\nObviously there are many more but these would be my top priority. The reality we live in shows no matter how much you tax the rich, it’s not enough to dissuade their lifestyle. At minimum, we should ensure their lifestyle does not damage the climate and knowledge is shared to open the market so we can all benefit from this technology and experience the joys of space travel.\n\n## As a kid I had a dream…now I want to make money\n\nNo one is getting into the space tourism and space travel business for altruistic reasons. Musk, Bezos and Branson are in this game to make money and there is a lot of money to be made.\n\n![Global Space Economy (2019)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*6ZL-N22Baf_huJcwZ-_Ijg.png)\n\nElon Musk has been paving the way in the space industry since the 2000’s, dramatically reducing the cost of rocket production and launch. Expendendable rockets costing hundreds of millions of dollars is quickly becoming a thing of the past. Companies can now book SpaceX’s Falcon 9 launch services for as little as $62m. In customary Musk fashion, that isn’t enough. He’s aiming for a $2m launch cost! In 2018, NASA was spending about $152m per launch. If he can follow through on his claims, that would be 1% of what NASA pays for a launch!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*KGEdrtnL6y1IZ-hfaSHeZQ.png)\n\nDeclining costs to launch a rocket ($/kg)\n\nSpaceX’s pitch and reputation went down very well because in May 2021, they won a $2.9Bn contract with NASA to take astronauts into orbit. That is still a small sliver of the pie. Elon Musk is laying down the foundations for a new network infrastructure via his StarLink satellites and can probably take a significant chunk of the navigation device transmisisons. I am sure Bezos, Branson and others are not far behind. Virgin Galactic has already quoted revenues up to $1Bn per ground spaceport they build.\n\nHowever, their space aspirations don’t stop there. The medium (900-2500 miles) to long-haul flights(>2500 miles) in aviation are also up for grabs.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Y8uJdOCfsCiD48OL-pGqFA.png)\n\nThe revenue opportunity for space travel is big and will reduce medium to long-haul flights\n\nEvery year, more people want to fly. Every year, emissions have increased. With so much demand, the impetus is not there to force change. The aviation industry has been asked, prodded and pressured to reduce their emissions. Unfortunately, industries only take reformative action when it will hurt their wallet not to do so. In 2018, The International Council of Clean Transporation reported that 66% of aviation’s passenger flight emissions come from medium and long haul flights.\n\nIt will take a few years before technological advances can bring the price of suborbital travel down, but down they will come. When they do, the aviation industry is going to change because they will not be the dominant force in the skies. The financial and environmental prize for Earth to Earth travel will be huge.\n\n## 2041\n\nTwo decades from now, Earth to Earth is nice. Interplanetary travel and space settlement will be revolutionary. That is the ultimate goal. The race to the red planet is well and truly underway. In that time, the technological advances in the space industry will have trickled down and translated into new products, businesses and industries.\n\nHowever, progress is only world progress in as far as it protects the planet. If these advances in space and settlement can offer technologies that provide green alternatives to aviation, manufacturing and transport, we need not see it as a power to destroy the earth. To move our home planet from a state of amber to green, we can see this industry as a friend of radical change, at a time when we need it most.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgZp0r6qjao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgZp0r6qjao)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633457139, "digest": "ho-paJJGKW1zFlGeKh0OA85Dvkjoxtaalro3RVxQdsY", "contributor": "0xd502079a1c7cc86291CeD01F0e818b60deAe6a31"}

Streaming video. Social creators. Podcasting. Newsletters. Makers. Influencers.\n\n![creator economy growth](https://blog.paperchain.io/img/Gumroad-creator-economy-1024x736.png)\n\nDigital media is on its way to being a [$400B industry](https://www.tvtechnology.com/news/digital-media-revenue-to-surpass-dollar292b-in-2021-report-finds). Much has been made of the creator economy, its rapid capture of digital media, the explosion in creator tooling and its relationship to the gig economy.\n\n![creator economy tools](https://blog.paperchain.io/img/8c0b6275-f38f-4633-afc0-e601c0c9c1ba_Screenshot2021-06-04at14.15.27_(1).png)\n\nIt’s important to understand:\n\n*CreatorEconomy ≠ GigEconomy*\n\nThere’s an [emerging crisis](https://li.substack.com/p/the-creator-economy-is-in-crisis) in the creator economy that does parallel the gig economy. That is a consolidation of distribution and discovery through a handful of social media and streaming platforms.\n\nThe Internet of Goods, as seen in direct creator monetization tools and NFTs, can set an entirely new foundation for creator discovery, community building and monetization.\n\n## NFTs\n\nNFTs have seen exception growth in 2021. Not only in terms of pure sales volume but in its public awareness. Digital assets in the crypto economy, NFTs are [art](https://www.moma.org/magazine/articles/547), [collectibles](https://kwhs.wharton.upenn.edu/2021/06/market-nft-digital-collectibles-hype-or-blockchain-bonanza/), [music](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/crypto-nft-gaming-ticketing-royalties-1197979/), [gaming assets](https://www.yahoo.com/now/nft-game-crosses-milestone-over-214023104.html), [access tokens](https://medium.com/nfty-news/nfty-news-16-using-tokens-as-access-passports-e86fb7276888), [fashion](https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/luxury-fashion-brands-poised-to-join-the-nft-party) and [social media](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/111040/niftys-launches-nft-focused-social-media-platform-with-10-million-in-seed-funding). Their usage across most of these industries has been around for many years, it’s only now that they’ve reached mainstream adoption.\n\nIn March 2021, the NFT/Collectibles marketplace had a market cap of $20B.\n\n![nft market cap](https://blog.paperchain.io/img/Screen_Shot_2021-08-11_at_2.49.00_PM.png)\n\nSource: [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/youngjoseph/2021/03/29/nft-market-rages-on-nfts-market-cap-grow-1785-in-2021-as-demand-explodes/?sh=4dc3233c7fdc)\n\nOpenSea has already passed $600M in sales volume in August (as of August 11, 2021).\n\n![opensea volume](https://blog.paperchain.io/img/Screen_Shot_2021-08-11_at_2.50.44_PM.png)\n\nSource: [Dune Analytics](https://dune.xyz/queries/3469/6913)\n\n## Internet of Money\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) arrived in the collective conscious on the back of Ethereum’s smart contract system and it’s ability to replicate or disrupt existing financial systems in a self-executing and self-governing way.\n\n$80B is now locked in DeFi protocols on the Ethereum blockchain ($40B increase from Mar 2021).\n\n![defi tvl](https://blog.paperchain.io/img/Screen_Shot_2021-08-11_at_3.03.58_PM.png)\n\nSource: [DeFi Pulse](https://defipulse.com/)\n\nDeFi is reaching an inflection point as it grows beyond crypto-native assets. MakerDAO just passed four new proposals to increase their debt ceiling for real world assets (RWAs) to [$40M](https://coinquora.com/centrifuge-and-makerdao-bring-real-world-assets-to-defi/).\n\nPaperchain is one of the first [RWAs to be accepted in the MakerDAO](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/67675/makerdao-community-vote-real-world-assets) debt pools.\n\nThis move continues the connection of DeFi to trillions of dollars in assets in the real world.\n\nThe creator economy stands as one of the benefits of this connection.\n\n## Paperchain = content 🤝 money\n\nWe talk ***a lot*** about what Paperchain is.\n\n[https://twitter.com/paperchainio/status/1413562910857703426](https://twitter.com/paperchainio/status/1413562910857703426)\n\nAn instant payments card for creators.

NFTs are programmable collateral that creates an interdependent creator economy.\n\n![paperchain product map](https://blog.paperchain.io/img/Screen_Shot_2021-08-11_at_4.07.26_PM.png)\n\nThis means instant payments for online content.

{"id": "wkFR945eGi3WYPJBYGmtRnHRkgzcM0dLgV16zKCPToQ", "title": "Summer of rockets - Age of Awareness", "body": "Space rockets are cool! Watching them blast off into space sparks the imagination and creates new generations of dreamers, innovators, designers and engineers. But is this a feasible mode of transport for the future? And should it be welcomed? My gut feeling is a resounding yes! Only money, time and monitoring data will tell. Space travel offers us a promising and potentially carbon reduced future; not to mention, all of the technological innovations that will undoubtedly be birthed in the process.\n\nHowever, we really should address the rocket-sized elephant in the room.\n\n## Rocket Emissions\n\nWe have recently been inundated with news coverage of commercial human space flight. Sir Richard Branson (Virgin Galactic) and Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) conducted what has got to be one of the most expensive product demos in recent history. They kicked off a new aviation industry niche called Space Tourism.\n\nA cursory look at news headlines or listening to Joe Public at your local pub, one could be forgiven for thinking that these space rockets were single-handedly going to destroy the earth. Despite what you may have read or heard, the total number of rockes emissions, globally, is miniscule in comparison to other modes of transport.\n\n![Global rocket emissions (2019)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*lKteL7t3yiEfViGd_VWXeg.png)\n\nHowever, this does not mean the Space Tourism industry should be left unchecked. As rocket launches increase, emissions will increase and the effects of CO2 and N2O in the stratosphere have a different kind of environmental effect. We should take this opportunity to champion a new form of travel whilst implementing the appropriate environmental safeguards.\n\n*If you want to learn more about the details behind rocket emissions, check out my appendix article —*[\\* \\*](https://medium.com/@darryll.colthrust/what-is-the-effect-of-the-virgin-galactic-flight-abc02a02cef0)***[What is the effect of the Virgin Galactic Flight?](https://medium.com/@darryll.colthrust/what-is-the-effect-of-the-virgin-galactic-flight-abc02a02cef0)***\n\n## Space Tourism\n\nJuly 2021 will be a historic month. It was the first marker in a new, “new” age of commercial space tourism and potentially space travel. Space. A destination that 99% of the world’s population didn’t think was in contention until billionaire’s started trolling each other over the Karman Line, suborbital vs orbital flight and asterisks.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Fc6QtUa6eD45TR6dp1oVlA.png)\n\nThe flights were brilliant product demos. In no uncertain terms, Space tourism is going to be an ultra luxury recreational activity. I’m sure there is going to be a Zero G & space craze. Space Hotels, Zero G dinners, parties, space walks, etc… It is a $5Bn niche segment of the aviation industry for the 1% and aspiring.\n\nIt is not space travel. You are not going to another physical location to disembark, yet. Its main purpose is recreation. It will be one of the most expensive 10min (Blue Origin) or 2hr (Virgin Galactic) fairground rides that 99% of the world’s population won’t be enjoying anytime soon. For most, the dream of going into space will only be realised through years of astronaut training or winning a golden ticket.\n\nThe allure of going into space, even for a few minutes of weightlessness should not be underestimated, nor should the extreme exhilaration of experiencing the world from a completely unique perspective. Given the means, I would happily join the queue of 600+ future passengers who have already signed up and paid between $250k.\n\nWhilst I’m laying it all out there, I would also choose the Blue Origin experience. At a similar ticket price, the $/min experience is extorniate, BUT, IT’S A FREAKING ROCKET!!!\n\n## Space Travel is VERY different to Space Tourism\n\nFor the purposes of this article, let’s call space travel, any form of orbital flight. Orbital being anything that leaves Earth’s atmosphere and can remain in space whilst the earth rotates. Space Tourism vessels do not remain in space.\n\nIt is only in recent history we have been able to start building reusable rockets, thus making Space Travel a possibility. Yes, I know the Space Shuttle was partially reusable, but at $211Bn to build with a $576m price tag per launch, it wasn’t cheap.\n\nIn modernish history, prior to commercial airlines, the only way to travel or transport goods long distance, en masse, was by sea or land. We are nearing the point where we have the technology to include space as another medium.\n\nImagine a world where a payload (human or cargo) could get anywhere on earth in less than an hour…and I mean ANYWHERE. Live in London, work in New York. Your commute home will be faster, and a lot more pleasant than current public or private transport. Humanitarian aid would be transformed. Food and infrastructure relief to emergency disaster areas in less than an hour! That would be an amazing sight and a reality I would wholeheartedly welcome.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqE-ultsWt0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqE-ultsWt0)\n\nSpaceX Starship: Travel anywhere on Earth in less than an hour.\n\nThe appropriate inter-governmental environmental policies would, of course, have to be put in place:\n\n* **All rockets are fully reusable**. Build once, use many times. This reduces the rocket launch and manufacturing carbon footprint.\n* **All rocket fuel is environmentally friendly**.\n* **Climate-positive rocket production. Not merely Carbon-neutral. Offsetting isn’t enough and doesn’t change behaviours.**\n* **Open technology and active knowledge sharing**\n\nObviously there are many more but these would be my top priority. The reality we live in shows no matter how much you tax the rich, it’s not enough to dissuade their lifestyle. At minimum, we should ensure their lifestyle does not damage the climate and knowledge is shared to open the market so we can all benefit from this technology and experience the joys of space travel.\n\n## As a kid I had a dream…now I want to make money\n\nNo one is getting into the space tourism and space travel business for altruistic reasons. Musk, Bezos and Branson are in this game to make money and there is a lot of money to be made.\n\n![Global Space Economy (2019)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*6ZL-N22Baf_huJcwZ-_Ijg.png)\n\nElon Musk has been paving the way in the space industry since the 2000’s, dramatically reducing the cost of rocket production and launch. Expendendable rockets costing hundreds of millions of dollars is quickly becoming a thing of the past. Companies can now book SpaceX’s Falcon 9 launch services for as little as $62m. In customary Musk fashion, that isn’t enough. He’s aiming for a $2m launch cost! In 2018, NASA was spending about $152m per launch. If he can follow through on his claims, that would be 1% of what NASA pays for a launch!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*KGEdrtnL6y1IZ-hfaSHeZQ.png)\n\nDeclining costs to launch a rocket ($/kg)\n\nSpaceX’s pitch and reputation went down very well because in May 2021, they won a $2.9Bn contract with NASA to take astronauts into orbit. That is still a small sliver of the pie. Elon Musk is laying down the foundations for a new network infrastructure via his StarLink satellites and can probably take a significant chunk of the navigation device transmisisons. I am sure Bezos, Branson and others are not far behind. Virgin Galactic has already quoted revenues up to $1Bn per ground spaceport they build.\n\nHowever, their space aspirations don’t stop there. The medium (900-2500 miles) to long-haul flights(>2500 miles) in aviation are also up for grabs.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Y8uJdOCfsCiD48OL-pGqFA.png)\n\nThe revenue opportunity for space travel is big and will reduce medium to long-haul flights\n\nEvery year, more people want to fly. Every year, emissions have increased. With so much demand, the impetus is not there to force change. The aviation industry has been asked, prodded and pressured to reduce their emissions. Unfortunately, industries only take reformative action when it will hurt their wallet not to do so. In 2018, The International Council of Clean Transporation reported that 66% of aviation’s passenger flight emissions come from medium and long haul flights.\n\nIt will take a few years before technological advances can bring the price of suborbital travel down, but down they will come. When they do, the aviation industry is going to change because they will not be the dominant force in the skies. The financial and environmental prize for Earth to Earth travel will be huge.\n\n## 2041\n\nTwo decades from now, Earth to Earth is nice. Interplanetary travel and space settlement will be revolutionary. That is the ultimate goal. The race to the red planet is well and truly underway. In that time, the technological advances in the space industry will have trickled down and translated into new products, businesses and industries.\n\nHowever, progress is only world progress in as far as it protects the planet. If these advances in space and settlement can offer technologies that provide green alternatives to aviation, manufacturing and transport, we need not see it as a power to destroy the earth. To move our home planet from a state of amber to green, we can see this industry as a friend of radical change, at a time when we need it most.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgZp0r6qjao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgZp0r6qjao)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633457338, "digest": "sc6dvIDjXbK66F2tTS6loBbWwE4Dlw1pUQa0H37Vkts", "contributor": "0xd502079a1c7cc86291CeD01F0e818b60deAe6a31"}

Also note, I could be totally fucking wrong about everything I’m about to write. This is mostly just me long form “tweeting into the ether” about my smart contract journey.

Doing it in a single transaction is a big plus ;)*\n\nOkay, so this problem isn’t even asking us to drain the cool expensive flash loan with 1k ETH; it just wants us to see if we can drain a separate contract, attached to an EOA that’s interacting with the flash loan contract.\n\n> NaiveReceiverLenderPool.sol\n\n![An image of the NaiveReceiverLenderPool smart contract](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*g9T7BDJDAzDbsRyx6JxJuA.png)\n\n> Sidenote: The first line of code is omitted here but it specifies the Solidity pragma as version \\*`^0.6.0`\n\nRight off the bat, we notice a few libraries brought in to handle issues like Reentrancy, arithmetic under/over flows, and a library for dealing with different address sources in Ethereum (contracts and EOAs). Cool.\n\nAs we read down the contract, I notice something that kind of gives me an immediate pause because who wants to pay a fee of 1ETH to take out a loan? That’s a pretty wild fee. Not only that but the variable for the fee is defined as both `private` and `constant` , meaning not only will this fee not be (easily) queryable and the value also cannot be changed after it is deployed.\n\n*Note:* `constant` and `immutable` keywords both specify a type of state variable on the Ethereum blockchain. `constant` keywords can’t be changed and must be set at creation while `immutable` can be changed within the constructor at deployment. Also, EVM doesn’t reserve storage for variables that are given these flags and instead just puts their value in place where the variable is called. (Not really sure what this really means yet will update later).\n\n### fixedFee\n\nThis is pretty straightforward, we have an external function that doesn’t do anything but read and return the `FIXED_FEE` `constant`variable that was defined earlier in the contract. Not much to gauge from this.\n\n### flashLoan\n\nThis shit is nonReentrant. Okay so any hopes I had initially of calling flashLoan multiple times to bankrupt the contract might be for naught. This f(x) is going to be called externally and it’s expecting just two arguments that it’ll process — namely, a `payable address` and a `uint256` known respectively as `borrower` and the `borrowAmount` and it does a couple of important checks right out the gate with these two pieces of info.\n\nFirst, we see that the f(x) is checking the current balance of the pool and then verifying that the amount being requested as the `borrowAmount` isn’t more than what’s actually available within the contract. Next, the f(x) is going to do a check on the `borrower` that was provided to ensure that this function is being called by a contract.\n\n> Sidenote: The `isContract`*method relies on* `extcodesize`, which returns 0 for contracts in construction, since the code is only stored at the end of the constructor execution. `EXTCODESIZE` returns 0 if it is called from the constructor of a contract. So if you are using this in a security sensitive setting, you would have to consider if this is a problem. \\*\\*\\**It is unsafe to assume that an address for which this function returns false is an externally-owned account (EOA) and not a contract. Among others,* `isContract` will return `false` for the following types of addresses: \\n — an externally-owned account \\n — a contract in construction \\n — an address where a contract will be created \\n — an address where a contract lived, but was destroyed\n\nAfter all of those checks clear out, the contract attempts to make a call to the `borrower` contract with a `call` that attempts to call a f(x) on the other end by the name of `receiveEther` that accepts a `uint256` as an argument with the `NaiveReceiverLendingPool`passing in its `FIXED_FEE` as the argument.\n\nWe do two final checks for this f(x) where we check if `success` of our external call is true and then we make sure that we were given our refund for the flashLoan at the end which will either succeed and everything is squared away or it fails and all the changes get reverted.\n\nNothing too big jumps out from any of this so far, but I’m very curious to see the f(x) on the other end that’s handling reception of the ETH as well as the payment of the fee.\n\n![Picture of the fallback function within NaiveRecieverLendingPool](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*8Jwx3MXjjVcCaQcktbC-cg.png)\n\n### fallback\n\nThis just looks like a basic fallback function for allowing the contract to accept deposits. No logic is found in the function, so I won’t spend too much time thinking about this one.\n\n> FlashLoanReceiver.sol\n\n![An image of the FlashLoanReceiver smart contract](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2navuXCzW50iSgJXnOD7L.png?height=1408&width=1556)\n\nAh, beautiful. There doesn’t seem to be any sort of guard for reentrancy imported here. Maybe we can use that? We are still using SafeMath and Address but this time we’re specifically using it for `address payable` and then immediately there’s this `address payable private pool` state that doesn’t get an instantiation from jump.\n\n### constructor\n\nHere we have a `public` constructor that is just taking `address payable pool` as its argument and setting `pool` to be an instance of the contract that’s being pointed to with the `poolAddress` variable, in our case the `NaiveReceiverLenderPool`\n\n### receiveEther\n\nThis is what we came for. We have a function that can be called by anyone to send value to this smart contract, and we also attach a `fee` argument here that maps to what we passed in as our `FIXED_FEE` and immediately makes a check to be sure that the address that is sending this call is matching the `pool` instance that was created in the constructor when the contract was deployed. We see that the f(x) creates `amountToBeRepaid` that takes whatever value is sent over for the loan request plus a fee of 1ETH as defined by `FIXED_FEE` , and then we make a quick check to be certain that the amount requested in addition to the `FIXED_FEE` is available in the contract to actually pay back the `NaiveReceiverLenderPool` at the end of this call. Some action is executed and then the money is returned to the lending pool; however, **the issue here is that the** `Receiver` **has absolutely no way to *reject* incoming loans that are called with their address. What this means is that, when we look at** `NaiveReceiverLenderPool` **we can see that the function to call flashLoan is only flagged to be called externally (by anyone) and we can supply an address of our choosing to accept the flashLoan by passing it into** `borrower` **, and in this case we can bankrupt** `Receiver` **entirely by asking for flash loans that are getting hit with a fee.**\n\n### _executeActionDuringFlashLoan\n\nThis is just some general `internal` f(x) that only `Receiver` can call in order to pull off whatever trading insight they believe they’ve reasoned upon. Nothing to see here beyond the confines of your own imagination.\n\n### fallback\n\nA fallback for just depositing money into the contract.\n\n## Solution\n\n![An image of the JS snippet used to verify exploit](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pAgP6SmUzNSyiKTAJrfTd.png?height=252&width=1226)\n\nSo the solution here is to just call `flashLoan` from our wallet, and we don’t even have to specify a loan amount as long as we have a 1 ETH `FIXED_FEE` , so we just drain the contract with 10 calls. I’m going to play around with the draining the contract in 1 transaction; I have a feeling there are a few options.\n\n### Reflection\n\nThis one made me feel bad 😞 I didn’t like draining some random person’s funds that’s cruel, but I did learn quite a bit about securing your contracts and making sure that receiving ether from a contract is always a more explicit flow for the `Receiver` — a few things I’d have done differently:\n\n1. A check within the `flashLoan` f(x) inside of `NaiveReceiverLendingPool`to be sure that `borrower` is `msg.sender` would be one change I’d make here to ensure that we aren’t actually letting random people request loans for others.\n2. We should probably add a check in this current `FlashLoanReceiver` to make sure that the trade was profitable or else we should revert like so `require(savedAmountFromExecuteFlashLoan > amountToBeRepaid + gasLimit)` This way we have the benefit of simply reverting which will cause `success` in `NaiveReceiverLendingPool` to be false which will cause the following `require` clause to fail.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis one was mostly just about considering the effects of withdrawal design and how dangerous it can be to not affirm origins of f(x) calls.", "timestamp": 1633457405, "digest": "eV4ON6xRvJUjR4PrKbl3OA9d7cKUlW9nuuNerfE5t6E", "contributor": "0xA699720418F612558E2827Bf68631686e9d1095e"}

I was wearing green sweat pants, slightly discolored from years of washing, and a college sweatshirt. Fall is turning, so this morning I covered up extra with a gray, fleece, Patagonia jacket.\n\nMom stood over the kitchen island sifting through coupon mailers. In the same voice she uses for her new grandchild, she said, “You look so cute!”\n\nI kept my head down to hide an embarrassed smirk. I continued to put together my small spread of wheat thins, sharp white cheddar singles, and dried beef sticks.\n\nMom smiled toward me, watching, as she decided whether she would buy pork belly from Fred Meyer or Safeway this week. Then she said, with both pride and disdain, “Ni de yifu bi ni de baba ling” (your jacket is better than your Dads).\n\nSeveral years ago I worked at a hedge fund that employed a lot of Harvard grads. The high proportion of a certain alma mater is only pertinent insomuch that it is what I imagine was pertinent to my Mom (and Dad too, I think). For the holidays, they gave everyone a nice gray, fleece, Patagonia jacket.\n\nDad recently started working for a startup and got some nice gear too. A few nights ago, during dinner, he wore a similar looking gray fleece Patagonia jacket from his work. Mom rubbed her hand on his sleeve, and pointed out, “this is not as nice as Wesley’s.” For what it’s worth, I think she’s right. The fleece was thinner, it looked more polyester, and it was gear budgeted for thousands of employees (the fancy hedge fund was only a few hundred).\n\nBut that night, and then earlier today at noon, I felt really bad, for Dad. Dad’s interviewed with a lot of the big prestigious tech firms and it hasn’t always gone so well. I know Mom knows this. She called me once and said, “I think your Dad is feeling depressed.” To me, it felt like Mom was putting Dad down, subtly reminding him of her judgment towards his (and his company’s) status.\n\n\\-\n\nLater, arriving home from visiting the new grandchild, Mom backseat-driver’ed Dad from the passenger side. We were pulling in to our garage in a large Toyota SUV, and as my Dad slowed the car down to squeeze us in, Mom gesticulated and raised her voice; she pointed at the side mirror closest to him, the side mirror closest to her, and the gap between the front of the car and the wall coming up; she yelled about which way he needed to look, what he should be paying attention to, and what he needs to do next time to avoid this catastrophe.\n\n\\-\n\nFor dinner Mom baked American style spare ribs she got on sale over the weekend. I was hungry and on the large ceramic serving plate there was one rib left. I looked at the pile of bones at my plate, while Mom and Dad only stacked three total. I said: “Dad, you should have the last one, look how many I already ate.” Dad shook his head and said no he didn’t want any. Mom said, “we’re old, you’re young, eat more.” I grabbed the last piece, but while I was eating, I felt really guilty. I thought about how both Mom and Dad were saying how surprised they were that these ribs were so much better than Costco’s. I saw Dad eating a little more of the green beans from last night — he wasn’t full yet. I should have made Dad eat the last one somehow, I thought. But how?\n\nI should have said I was full and wanted to just have some of the watermelon in the fridge.\n\nI shouldn’t have considered touching the last one.", "timestamp": 1633457889, "digest": "Wld4WdmZaJPckmxy030imogDT4at1Nv4L8SP1bRpRHw", "contributor": "0xa444734C709e250a5d147D09B247E490d29f771E"}

{"id": "FZ-bJM2YLv5nVxGIjco3bxBP2yziUXZftrNk8jjjfNQ", "title": "Kinopio: an homage to being unique", "body": "*I first learned about [Kinopio](https://kinopio/?utm_source=communityweekly&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=interview) from the [report on Personal Knowledge Management niche done by Nesslabs](https://nesslabs.com/the-state-of-personal-knowledge-management?utm_source=communityweekly&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=interview).*\n\n*I was looking for a place I could  visualize my thoughts and ideas, connect them together, connect my notes from other tools and see everything in a new light.*\n\n*Kinopio definitely is a different kind of tool in the PKM niche. It doesn't have that academic feel like Roam Research, no fun-corporate-productivity of Miro and 0 of Notion. And what is it in that case?*\n\n*I'd refer to you to use Kinopio if you want to create something that has no boundaries, no rules. Kinopio is an anti-clean-cut tool, where you don't need to have a structure, and all you need to do is be yourself.*\n\n*I talked to the founder of Kinopio [Pirijan](https://twitter.com/pketh) to understand who is on the other side of the screen, where Kinopio is being developed.*\n\n## Key stats about Kinopio\n\nLaunched: 2019\n\nNumber of customers: 100 paying customers\n\nMRR: $500\n\nNumber of spaces created by signed in users: 18070\n\n## Anna: Why you started Kinopio?\n\n**Pirijan:** After leaving my last job as co-creator of Glitch, I wanted to build a different kind of software which felt inherently fun but was also useful. In my own life, I'd noticed that before I wrote specs and other planning documents, I'd often think things out in a sketch document or on paper in a very non-linear way.\n\nAt the root of Kinopio is a simple premise: that putting your thoughts out there without structure and then connecting them spatially is a really great way to solve problems and come up with new ideas.\n\n## Anna: Is this your full time project?\n\n**Pirijan:** Yup\n\n## Anna: What pain are you trying to solve with Kinopio?\n\n**Pirijan:** We have these super computers, on our desks and in our pockets, but we still can only write things down linearly from the top-down – because that's how typewriters worked. I think better tools can help us think better too.\n\n## Anna: Who is the person that uses Kinopio? Can you describe your customer?\n\n**Pirijan:** I can't really, so I asked them to describe themselves and [how they found Kinopio](https://kinopio.club/ideas-for-growing-kinopio-WjASP_gR0dWatK1Avy_rJ ). From designers, parents, friends, teachers, programmers, accountants, project planners, people using it for fun, or for work and meetings, there's a lot of range. I try not to build things for specific people or personas.\n\nI like making creative tools that are easy, invited, but have a lot of hidden depth and expressiveness – this way I get to be surprised by what people do with it.\n\n## Anna: Kinopio has a very specific aesthetic. Did you come up with it right away or it appeared later?\n\n**Pirijan:** The aesthetic is a product of evolving the visual language I made for Glitch, using 90s electronic music instruments and other tactile feeling things. The core aesthetic was defined pretty early, here's a mockup from over 2 years ago (<https://www.are.na/block/4225887>), obviously very much has changed but you can see the origins there.\n\n## Anna: What is your most favorite feature in Kinopio?\n\n**Pirijan:** Of course I have a Kinopio account myself, but I love that you can use Kinopio without having to sign up or read through a marketing page first. On the surface, it seems like such a basic thing, but to do this means that every part of the application (the web client and server) had to be tightly designed and architected around this idea.\n\nMy favorite kinds of features are the ones where engineering and design are really tightly woven together.\n\n## Anna: What was the most requested feature in Kinopio?\n\n**Pirijan:** With all the issues I go through on the [support forum](http://club.kinopio.club), it all seems to blur together these days. I think currently the number one request is card resizing, which will be coming in a couple months.\n\nTypically the people requesting features are already expert users so it's important for me to balance those requests against building things that I think will benefit new users as well.\n\n## Anna: How did you come up with the pricing? It's relatively low from it's competitors in the space.\n\n**Pirijan:** Oh is it? That's certainly not intentional, but pricing is always a dark art because everyone's expectations are anchored by different products. That said, I started intentionally low at $4/mo when I was less sure of the demand, and last year increased prices to $5/mo for new customers. I suspect that next year I'll increase prices again, and adjusting from there.\n\nI guess my strategy is to incrementally evolve pricing, and to reward early customers.\n\n## Anna: You launched twice on ProductHunt in the span of almost 1 year. What did you learn from the launches?\n\n**Pirijan:** Mostly I learned a lot about how ProductHunt works, it's deliberately not the most straight-forward system. I wrote some detailed thoughts at [my blog](https://futureland.tv/pirijan/entry/96171,).\n\n> I think the most important point to remember is that Producthunt is a ranking of immediate popularity and influence – which is not necessarily correlated to product quality and value, especially in the long-term.\n\n*First version of [Kinopio's launch](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/kinopio) is Product of the Day on Producthunt.*\n\n## Anna: Was the iOS and Android apps a frequent request?\n\n**Pirijan:** It came up from time to time, but Kinopio was built from the start to work on mobile. What I realized is that no-one expected that to be the case because it's not how most web apps are built. Because of this, the real value of providing 'apps' was to meet people's existing expectations of mobile.\n\n## Anna: I noticed you have Discord community. What was the purpose of the community?\n\n**Pirijan:** The Discord chat probably wouldn't exist if it wasn't for [Ben Tsai](http://twitter.com/bentsai) proposing the idea and offering to moderate it in order to bring community members together. Real-time chat is too high-bandwidth for me to keep up with on a regular basis, but it's proven immensely useful for everyone.\n\n## Anna: How are you growing your product? Is it just word of mouth?\n\n**Pirijan:** For the most part yes, it's word of mouth from people who love it, and from me regularly sharing what I'm working on, what's new, and what cool spaces I've seen.\n\n## Anna: You have a biweekly newsletter for Kinopio called Bulletin. How do you choose what to highlight in the newsletter?\n\n**Pirijan:** Although each Bulletin is a freeform HTML document, I generally like to stick to three sections: \"A life anecdote or thought\", \"What's new with Kinopio\", and \"What's Upcoming\". The first section is by far the hardest one to write. In some cases, the first section will be an announcement of something important, but most times I approach it like I'm writing an olde tyme letter to a dear friend I haven't seen in awhile.\n\n## Anna: Kinopio also has public API. Where customers requesting it?\n\n**Pirijan:** I built the API well before anyone requested it. I think the process of building an API for the public helps when designing even internal APIs, it helps clarify the design because it has to be straightforward and explainable.\n\nAlso, on principle, I think that it's important that tools are accessible in lots of ways and don't live in a silo.\n\n## Anna: You are very open with your process of building Kinopio, I'm curious why you didn't make it open-source then?\n\n**Pirijan:** In the early days I got asked that a lot more often. I think in software we think that if something is made by individuals, then the code should default to being open. But I think this assumption kind of demeans creators by implying that only big companies can make 'serious' software.\n\nI'm open with the process of building Kinopio because I think that's the kind of 'open' that really matters, because it benefits everyone (not just coders). Especially for a project with a huge interface and hundreds of files, I think that knowing the thinking behind a project says more than a stack of code in a github repo does.\n\n## Anna: On your personal website you have a section talking about Kinopio's life and (possible?) death. Are you considering Kinopio a sustainable business yet?\n\n*excerpt from [My Plans for Kinopio](https://pketh.org/kinopio-plans.html)*\n\n> We don’t live in a deterministic world. I could do everything right and still run out of money without being able to turn Kinopio into a healthy, sustainable business. If that happens, you won’t lose any data and Kinopio will still be usable.\n\n> The client app is like a cockroach, it’s tiny, free to host, and doesn’t depend on a connection to the server app.\n\n**Pirijan:** I think from that time I've gained a lot more confidence that people really do like using Kinopio and will pay for it. Because of this, I consider Kinopio an endeavour with real long-term promise, but until I can at least pay my rent with it it's not yet economically-sustainable. That being said, the current pattern of steady and consistent growth is very promising.\n\n## Anna: What do you think is missing in the note taking/visualization tools in general?\n\n**Pirijan:** I think there's a lot of same-y-ness out there. It seems like everyone's aspiring to compete for the same enterprise dollars. I get it, there's a lot of those dollars. But because of that I think they're designed with conformity to an apple/corporate-y aesthetic in mind.\n\nOr possibly it's because designers are all exposed to and influenced by the same things (vintage braun, modern apple, etc.), which creates some kind of circle-jerk of taste?\n\n## Anna: Is your mom still asking you to find a real job?\n\n**Pirijan:** Nah she's given up lol\n\n## Anna: What are your plans for Kinopio in future?\n\n**Pirijan:** There's still a couple of key tentpole features that I want to complete for Kinopio. And along the way, there's those little everyday improvements and fixes.\n\nLooking up from that, I want to eventually explore contracting artists for things like physical goods and card frames. I think I'll be able to do more of that when I'm in a more sustainable place.", "timestamp": 1633457930, "digest": "KdGk6YV3t1pRp-77i2FqoadAHmg39XGYndgWQNWDlP4", "contributor": "0x8107418C24266c3007dB53E4aA4ae480F70E24F8"}

Also note, I could be totally fucking wrong about everything I’m about to write. This is mostly just me long form “tweeting into the ether” about my smart contract journey. Proceed with caution.*\n\n## Problem\n\n> *More and more lending pools are offering flash loans. In this case, a new pool has launched that is offering flash loans of DVT tokens for free.*\n>\n> *Currently the pool has 1 million DVT tokens in balance. And you have nothing.*\n>\n> *But don’t worry, you might be able to steal them all from the pool.*\n\nThis problem looks like it’s expecting us to drain the lender completely and walk away with a bunch of (or all of) the DVT tokens.\n\n> TrusterLenderPool.sol\n\n![An image of the TrusterLenderPool smart contract](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sTSnBLdh0HEDWu_LC7ElD.png?height=1367&width=2060)\n\nThis seems like it should’ve been the first problem posted! I could be wrong, but it seems like the issue here almost immediately jumps out `target.call(data)` , but I know the story of Icarus too well, so we are going to go through it anyways. Per usual, we see that OpenZeppelin at the top of the board, providing us the ERC20 Interface and the ReentrancyGuard which doesn’t really matter here I don’t think because we aren’t going to exploit this contract with reentrancy. We’re going to do it with the ERC20 Interface that’s pointing at the smart contract that manages the DVT tokens 😵.\n\n### constructor\n\nWhen the `TrusterLenderPool`contract is initially deployed we are just going to create a reference to the contract address passed in by the person deploying, in this case, we’re expecting `tokenAddress` to point to the contract address that holds all of the DVT tokens.\n\n> Sidenote: I’m going to go on a small tangent about ERC20 standard and why I think it’s important to this particular exploit.\n>\n> **totalSupply()** - how many total tokens will be created and managed within this contract (also can think of this as the sum of all token balances)\n>\n> **balanceOf(address _owner)** - how many tokens does the supplied address own\n>\n> **transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)** - take the number of tokens specified in `_value` and record that value as being available for the address `_to` and it’s very important to remember that these are just state changes, no tokens are actually *moving* anywhere\n>\n> **transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value)** - same logic as the `transfer` method but instead of assuming that the state change is between the smart contract managing the ERC20 token it’s assuming that this is a value transfer happening between two actors where ***neither*** is the smart contract managing the ERC20 tokens (this is like sending tokens to your friends or maybe another contract where you manage your holdings across multiple ERC20 contracts)\n>\n> **approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)** - in order to actually use the tokens you must call this function with the address of the account we want to authorize to spend from the DVT contract as well as specifying the actual amount we would like to approve for extraction. It’s like going to the bank and telling the teller, “Hey, I know I have $300 in my bank account, but I’d like you to reject any attempt to spend more than $100”. (This is how we exploit the contract, I believe but more on that later).\n>\n> **allowance(address _owner, address _spender)** - allowance is the function that tells you just how much a particular account has been approved to pull from a particular users wallet or smart contract. In this case our `_owner` is the DVT contract and our `_spender` would be us. It’s also important to note that `allowance` and `balanceOf` can be mismatched.\n>\n> One final thing to always remember about using ERC20 standards (and generally any standard) is that every single function is ***public and callable by anyone.***\n\n### flashLoan\n\nI don’t want to be too arrogant with this, but I’m increasingly convinced that the call data is the vulnerability here. The f(x) takes in 4 parameters for extending a flash loan, namely:\n\n> `uint256 borrowAmount` (how much money are we asking for with this loan)\n>\n> `address borrower` (who is requesting the loan)\n>\n> `address target` (who are we wanting to execute the `call` on)\n>\n> `bytes calldata data` (what information do we want to send to target to perform the function)\n\nThis f(x) is again non reentrant and it requires an `external` accessor. Ok, cool. Immediately, the contract is going to check to see if the balance available in the contract is sufficient to satisfy the requested `borrowAmount` at which point we will automatically call the `transfer` method which will “send” the requested `borrowAmount` to our `borrower` and this sets us up for the trick. In line 27, we see that we attempt to have the `target` call a function with the `data` provided when the function is called.\n\n> Sidenote: **calldata** (special data location that contains the function arguments, only available for external function call parameters), is usually used to encode functions for talking directly to the EVM. Which is this case is an indication that we should be sending an encoded function definition for the `target` to satisfy\n\nSo for this piece, we can’t just take the money immediately in the first run because the `flashLoan` f(x) is checking to make sure that the balance is restored at the end of the the call or all changes will end up being reverted and no one makes any money and now you’ve spent gas for nothing! So, what we can do here is instead of trying to steal the tokens, we can `approve` our address for the total balance of the DVT contract and circle back after our approval is successfully made and `transfer` all of the DVT tokens to myself.\n\n> Sidenote: our `balanceOf` will be `0` when the function is done running but our `allowance` will be the total supply of tokens currently in the pool.\n\n## solution\n\nWe can use `web3` or `ethers` libraries for creating our encoded f(x) which is simple enough it just allows for telling the EVM the exact bytecode for the function we’re looking for and the arguments we’d like to call it with (if any).\n\n![The top level view of the truster.js test file using web3](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*WdACR6sZXyE7BD7lDrIjLg.png)\n\n![The top level view of the truster.js test file using ethers](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*0C1Cjkc7QMxkHxj-i-FzQg.png)\n\n![The Exploit function within tester.js file using web3](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Axvx1vaLF6d8Oh4ly1c8Dg.png)\n\n![The exploit function within tester.js file using ethers](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*dfZiNvsiY7lTQcXp_BiDQA.png)\n\nThe `encodeFunctionCall`is pretty standard, we are defining the entire function call with parameters ***and*** signature. The array at the end supplies the variables we’d like to encode and pass in as our `inputs` mapping `attacker` to the `spender` and `TOKENS_IN_POOL` to `amount` and then we call `flashLoan` supplying nothing for the `borrowAmount`, so we don’t have to pay anything back to satisfy the balance checks made in the contract, we want to set our `attacker` as the `borrower` and our `target` that we want to make the function call is the address for our DVT smart contract and finally we pass in our `data` which is our manually constructed f(x) call to have the DVT contract call `approve` on itself with `attacker` in place of `spender` and `TOKENS_IN_POOL` being the total amount we are approved to transfer out in the next line with `transferFrom` — and just like that we’ve drained it.\n\n### reflection\n\nThe main thing here is just being careful with the passing in `calldata` as well as being careful about specifying who can actually call a function and who they can have call the function. There wasn’t really any reason I can see to even include a `target` here within the `flashLoan` piece it wasn’t really necessary to enable the sending of the loans, and even more so it didn’t even really matter who we set as the `borrower` since `attacker` is being mapped to `spender` within `data` , so in theory we could’ve called `flashLoan` with any address we wanted as `borrower` and it would have no bearing on the success of this exploit as long as the proper address for the attacker is encoded in `data.`\n\n### conclusion\n\nThis was a bit clearer for me to solve, but I’m not sure if it’s because I’m getting better or if I just happened to already have the requisite knowledge of encoding function calls to see a clear error here. Whenever I see flash loans in the wild, I typically see a calldata piece that allows users to specify function calls but this seems like something you’d want to do from the `borrower` side and not the DVT smart contract side, so that we aren’t having the DVT contract calling public functions on itself like that, but I’m going to spend a lot more time investigating the positive use cases for a pattern like this and how to better defend against it.", "timestamp": 1633457936, "digest": "3yqfg1d72zjagzX5ymck_TyOYs24TpMJce_x224nEG4", "contributor": "0xA699720418F612558E2827Bf68631686e9d1095e"}

This would be done by using balancers stability pool (MAI,DAI,USDT,USDC) as possible liquidation scenarios due to the price action of the underlying collateral in the camVAULT (in this case MATIC). The stablecoins can be withdrawn from balancer and used to repay part of the loan to bring it back to a safer LTV. Apart from this QiDao is incentivising deposits whose LTV ranged between 160% and 400% for camWMATIC and BAL with \\~30% and \\~120% in Qi Tokens respectively. This gives a huge boost to lending APY provided that the LTV is always maintained.\n\nBelow are the steps involved to execute the strategy involving ***Aave<>QiDao<>Balancer:***\n\n1\\. Deposit MATIC on Aave to receive ***amWMATIC (3.60% APY)***\n\n2\\. Deposit amWMATIC in the \"\\*\\*Yield\" \\*\\*section of QiDao to create a ***camWMATIC(3.80%  APY)***\n\n3\\. Create a camWMATIC vault (\\~30% Qi Rewards for LTV between 160%-400%)\n\n4\\. Borrow 40% worth of the camWMATIC in MAI at an initial LTV of 250%\n\n5\\. Deposit the borrowed MAI in the BAL stability pool ***(\\~18% - 15% BAL, 1.5% Fees, 1.5% Qi)***\n\n6\\. Since MATIC is a volatile asset we have to be careful of maintaining a safe LTV ratio ***(Lower: 200% and Upper: 270%)***\n\n7\\. If the LTV falls below 200% then part of the funds in the stability pool will be used to repay the loan to bring it back to 200%\n\n8\\. If the LTV goes above 270% then we will borrow more MAI and deposit in the BAL stability pool to bring the LTV back down to 270% in order to ensure capital efficiency.\n\n9\\. The BAL rewards get paid out every Wednesday and this is used to create a BAL vault on QiDao (\\~120% Qi Rewards for LTV between 160%-400%) and more MAI is minted at an initial LTV of 250%\n\n10\\. Similar to MATIC the safety of the camBAL vault is ensured by maintaining an LTV range of 200% - 270% and repaying / borrowing MAI based on the situation.\n\n11\\. The qi rewards from BAL and QiDao lending must be staked for 1 year at \\~100% APR or can be sold to buy more MAI which is re-deployed in BAL stability pool ***(this depends on your risk profile).***\n\n12\\. The entire cycle goes on loop and the APY is directly propoertional to the price of the MATIC collateral as it influcnces the amount of MAI that can be borrowed.\n\nThe entire process is explained in a flow chart for your easy understanding\n\nThe detailed computation of the strategy is provided below for your reference:\n\n[Detailed Strategy Computation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JEu-5Kaxs5yMSQpS0TrmO-CylZjmEqVUFDA1W0-GhXo/edit?usp=sharing)", "timestamp": 1633457928, "digest": "TyDTRzT2UFMUn0wVNp461py4MV13V6CXidfpYqWHbT8", "contributor": "0x5D0C7CdF32bcea1632BCae9d11681a6b61c13826"}

I was wearing green sweat pants, slightly discolored from years of washing, and a college sweatshirt. Fall is turning, so this morning I covered up extra with a gray, fleece, Patagonia jacket.\n\nMom stood over the kitchen island sifting through coupon mailers. In the same voice she uses for her new grandchild, she said, “You look so cute!”\n\nI kept my head down to hide an embarrassed smirk. I continued to put together my small spread of wheat thins, sharp white cheddar singles, and dried beef sticks.\n\nMom smiled toward me, watching, as she decided whether she would buy pork belly from Fred Meyer or Safeway this week. Then she said, with both pride and disdain, “Ni de yifu bi ni de baba ling” (your jacket is better than your Dads).\n\nSeveral years ago I worked at a hedge fund that employed a lot of Harvard grads. The high proportion of a certain alma mater is only pertinent insomuch that it is what I imagine was pertinent to my Mom (and Dad too, I think). For the holidays, they gave everyone a nice gray, fleece, Patagonia jacket.\n\nDad recently started working for a startup and got some nice gear too. A few nights ago, during dinner, he wore a similar looking gray fleece Patagonia jacket from his work. Mom rubbed her hand on his sleeve, and pointed out, “this is not as nice as Wesley’s.” For what it’s worth, I think she’s right. The fleece was thinner, it looked more polyester, and it was gear budgeted for thousands of employees (the fancy hedge fund was only a few hundred).\n\nBut that night, and then earlier today at noon, I felt really bad, for Dad. Dad’s interviewed with a lot of the big prestigious tech firms and it hasn’t always gone so well. I know Mom knows this. She called me once and said, “I think your Dad is feeling depressed.” To me, it felt like Mom was putting Dad down, subtly reminding him of her judgment towards his (and his company’s) status.\n\n\\-\n\nLater, arriving home from visiting the new grandchild, Mom backseat-driver’ed Dad from the passenger side. We were pulling in to our garage in a large Toyota SUV, and as my Dad slowed the car down to squeeze us in, Mom gesticulated and raised her voice; she pointed at the side mirror closest to him, the side mirror closest to her, and the gap between the front of the car and the wall coming up; she yelled about which way he needed to look, what he should be paying attention to, and what he needs to do next time to avoid this catastrophe.\n\n\\-\n\nFor dinner Mom baked American style spare ribs she got on sale over the weekend. I was hungry and on the large ceramic serving plate there was one rib left. I looked at the pile of bones at my plate, while Mom and Dad only stacked three total. I said: “Dad, you should have the last one, look how many I already ate.” Dad shook his head and said no he didn’t want any. Mom said, “we’re old, you’re young, eat more.” I grabbed the last piece, but while I was eating, I felt really guilty. I thought about how both Mom and Dad were saying how surprised they were that these ribs were so much better than Costco’s. I saw Dad eating a little more of the green beans from last night — he wasn’t full yet. I should have made Dad eat the last one somehow, I thought. But how?\n\nI should have said I was full and wanted to just have some of the watermelon in the fridge.\n\nI shouldn’t have considered touching the last one.", "timestamp": 1633457874, "digest": "f4y_8R6BZX6L9Mk2vP-nu37xlPjcU7fx7S4Hy42ss-w", "contributor": "0xa444734C709e250a5d147D09B247E490d29f771E"}

It doesn't have that academic feel like Roam Research, no fun-corporate-productivity of Miro and 0 of Notion. And what is it in that case?*\n\n*I'd refer to you to use Kinopio if you want to create something that has no boundaries, no rules. Kinopio is an anti-clean-cut tool, where you don't need to have a structure, and all you need to do is be yourself.*\n\n*I talked to the founder of Kinopio [Pirijan](https://twitter.com/pketh) to understand who is on the other side of the screen, where Kinopio is being developed.*\n\n## Key stats about Kinopio\n\nLaunched: 2019\n\nNumber of customers: 100 paying customers\n\nMRR: $500\n\nNumber of spaces created by signed in users: 18070\n\n## Anna: Why you started Kinopio?\n\n**Pirijan:** After leaving my last job as co-creator of Glitch, I wanted to build a different kind of software which felt inherently fun but was also useful. In my own life, I'd noticed that before I wrote specs and other planning documents, I'd often think things out in a sketch document or on paper in a very non-linear way.\n\nAt the root of Kinopio is a simple premise: that putting your thoughts out there without structure and then connecting them spatially is a really great way to solve problems and come up with new ideas.\n\n## Anna: Is this your full time project?\n\n**Pirijan:** Yup\n\n## Anna: What pain are you trying to solve with Kinopio?\n\n**Pirijan:** We have these super computers, on our desks and in our pockets, but we still can only write things down linearly from the top-down – because that's how typewriters worked. I think better tools can help us think better too.\n\n## Anna: Who is the person that uses Kinopio? Can you describe your customer?\n\n**Pirijan:** I can't really, so I asked them to describe themselves and [how they found Kinopio](https://kinopio.club/ideas-for-growing-kinopio-WjASP_gR0dWatK1Avy_rJ ). From designers, parents, friends, teachers, programmers, accountants, project planners, people using it for fun, or for work and meetings, there's a lot of range. I try not to build things for specific people or personas.\n\nI like making creative tools that are easy, invited, but have a lot of hidden depth and expressiveness – this way I get to be surprised by what people do with it.\n\n## Anna: Kinopio has a very specific aesthetic. Did you come up with it right away or it appeared later?\n\n**Pirijan:** The aesthetic is a product of evolving the visual language I made for Glitch, using 90s electronic music instruments and other tactile feeling things. The core aesthetic was defined pretty early, here's a mockup from over 2 years ago (<https://www.are.na/block/4225887>), obviously very much has changed but you can see the origins there.\n\n## Anna: What is your most favorite feature in Kinopio?\n\n**Pirijan:** Of course I have a Kinopio account myself, but I love that you can use Kinopio without having to sign up or read through a marketing page first. On the surface, it seems like such a basic thing, but to do this means that every part of the application (the web client and server) had to be tightly designed and architected around this idea.\n\nMy favorite kinds of features are the ones where engineering and design are really tightly woven together.\n\n## Anna: What was the most requested feature in Kinopio?\n\n**Pirijan:** With all the issues I go through on the [support forum](http://club.kinopio.club), it all seems to blur together these days. I think currently the number one request is card resizing, which will be coming in a couple months.\n\nTypically the people requesting features are already expert users so it's important for me to balance those requests against building things that I think will benefit new users as well.\n\n## Anna: How did you come up with the pricing? It's relatively low from it's competitors in the space.\n\n**Pirijan:** Oh is it? That's certainly not intentional, but pricing is always a dark art because everyone's expectations are anchored by different products. That said, I started intentionally low at $4/mo when I was less sure of the demand, and last year increased prices to $5/mo for new customers. I suspect that next year I'll increase prices again, and adjusting from there.\n\nI guess my strategy is to incrementally evolve pricing, and to reward early customers.\n\n## Anna: You launched twice on ProductHunt in the span of almost 1 year. What did you learn from the launches?\n\n**Pirijan:** Mostly I learned a lot about how ProductHunt works, it's deliberately not the most straight-forward system. I wrote some detailed thoughts at [my blog](https://futureland.tv/pirijan/entry/96171,).\n\n> I think the most important point to remember is that Producthunt is a ranking of immediate popularity and influence – which is not necessarily correlated to product quality and value, especially in the long-term.\n\n*First version of [Kinopio's launch](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/kinopio) is Product of the Day on Producthunt.*\n\n## Anna: Was the iOS and Android apps a frequent request?\n\n**Pirijan:** It came up from time to time, but Kinopio was built from the start to work on mobile. What I realized is that no-one expected that to be the case because it's not how most web apps are built. Because of this, the real value of providing 'apps' was to meet people's existing expectations of mobile.\n\n## Anna: I noticed you have Discord community. What was the purpose of the community?\n\n**Pirijan:** The Discord chat probably wouldn't exist if it wasn't for [Ben Tsai](http://twitter.com/bentsai) proposing the idea and offering to moderate it in order to bring community members together. Real-time chat is too high-bandwidth for me to keep up with on a regular basis, but it's proven immensely useful for everyone.\n\n## Anna: How are you growing your product? Is it just word of mouth?\n\n**Pirijan:** For the most part yes, it's word of mouth from people who love it, and from me regularly sharing what I'm working on, what's new, and what cool spaces I've seen.\n\n## Anna: You have a biweekly newsletter for Kinopio called Bulletin. How do you choose what to highlight in the newsletter?\n\n**Pirijan:** Although each Bulletin is a freeform HTML document, I generally like to stick to three sections: \"A life anecdote or thought\", \"What's new with Kinopio\", and \"What's Upcoming\". The first section is by far the hardest one to write. In some cases, the first section will be an announcement of something important, but most times I approach it like I'm writing an olde tyme letter to a dear friend I haven't seen in awhile.\n\n## Anna: Kinopio also has public API. Where customers requesting it?\n\n**Pirijan:** I built the API well before anyone requested it. I think the process of building an API for the public helps when designing even internal APIs, it helps clarify the design because it has to be straightforward and explainable.\n\nAlso, on principle, I think that it's important that tools are accessible in lots of ways and don't live in a silo.\n\n## Anna: You are very open with your process of building Kinopio, I'm curious why you didn't make it open-source then?\n\n**Pirijan:** In the early days I got asked that a lot more often. I think in software we think that if something is made by individuals, then the code should default to being open. But I think this assumption kind of demeans creators by implying that only big companies can make 'serious' software.\n\nI'm open with the process of building Kinopio because I think that's the kind of 'open' that really matters, because it benefits everyone (not just coders). Especially for a project with a huge interface and hundreds of files, I think that knowing the thinking behind a project says more than a stack of code in a github repo does.\n\n## Anna: On your personal website you have a section talking about Kinopio's life and (possible?) death. Are you considering Kinopio a sustainable business yet?\n\n*excerpt from [My Plans for Kinopio](https://pketh.org/kinopio-plans.html)*\n\n> We don’t live in a deterministic world. I could do everything right and still run out of money without being able to turn Kinopio into a healthy, sustainable business. If that happens, you won’t lose any data and Kinopio will still be usable.\n\n> The client app is like a cockroach, it’s tiny, free to host, and doesn’t depend on a connection to the server app.\n\n**Pirijan:** I think from that time I've gained a lot more confidence that people really do like using Kinopio and will pay for it. Because of this, I consider Kinopio an endeavour with real long-term promise, but until I can at least pay my rent with it it's not yet economically-sustainable. That being said, the current pattern of steady and consistent growth is very promising.\n\n## Anna: What do you think is missing in the note taking/visualization tools in general?\n\n**Pirijan:** I think there's a lot of same-y-ness out there. It seems like everyone's aspiring to compete for the same enterprise dollars. I get it, there's a lot of those dollars. But because of that I think they're designed with conformity to an apple/corporate-y aesthetic in mind.\n\nOr possibly it's because designers are all exposed to and influenced by the same things (vintage braun, modern apple, etc.), which creates some kind of circle-jerk of taste?\n\n## Anna: Is your mom still asking you to find a real job?\n\n**Pirijan:** Nah she's given up lol\n\n## Anna: What are your plans for Kinopio in future?\n\n**Pirijan:** There's still a couple of key tentpole features that I want to complete for Kinopio. And along the way, there's those little everyday improvements and fixes.\n\nLooking up from that, I want to eventually explore contracting artists for things like physical goods and card frames. I think I'll be able to do more of that when I'm in a more sustainable place.", "timestamp": 1633457937, "digest": "MUOSg8Sw9DojSxdIUOif7Z4YYzvS7JfPAIVgw3zUlkg", "contributor": "0x8107418C24266c3007dB53E4aA4ae480F70E24F8"}

Llevaba ya unas semanas frecuentando esa esquina en el Distrito de las Flores; disfruto cómo la luz se filtra suavemente entre los edificios, pero la principal razón es la escasez de feroces roedores de los que me tengo que cuidar. Pero la abundante presencia de turistas a unas calles de aquí, y la proximidad del verano, son factores que ahora las llevan hacia mí.\n\n![Nueva York, Enero 1, 2017](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XTnFYioBKkSGnRkW_19o0.jpg?height=675&width=1200&&&size=medium)\n\nRecogí mi carrito de supermercado con todo lo que estaba a mi nombre y comencé a caminar sin rumbo claro, pero avanzando. No eran más de las seis de la tarde. El sol comenzaba a caer, y me fui encaminando hacia Times Square. No me emocionaba mucho, pues detestaba ver la repulsión en la gente que me miraba. Después de años aún no me puedo acostumbrar a eso. Todos tenemos nuestras debilidades.\n\nLo único que disfrutaba de la avenida era ver los espectaculares tapizar cada centímetro de los edificios. Éramos siempre testigos de un verdadero orgasmo capitalista. Comenzó un nuevo anuncio. Me sorprendí al ver esos ojos bicolor tan únicos.

{"id": "jYRDo5vEHO94ILHlA9v4pb9UYkfaeM-dm427emlrhaQ", "title": "Motherland", "body": "So many of us grow up as “others”. Questioning where we fit in, who our tribe is and how our identity meets the world. For me, this was the story of much of my life as a Japanese-New Zealander who was never Japanese enough to be Japanese, or white enough to be white. My teenage love of jazz, hip hop and drum’n’bass all stemmed from the same needs - these were music forms where I could find comfort and community through diving into albums created from artists’ own searches for belonging and identity: sonic offerings that decried the status quo and mainstream seeking something more. This premise has been my foundation as an artist - creating music that looks to answer my own inner questions and reflect the world I see, while knowing that emulating the status quo does little to help me understand my own past, present and future.\n\n**Motherland** is a 43-minute film, a meditative audio-visual exploration of my Japanese ancestry and culture. Presented as both a **super-NFT film** and **audio NFTs**, Motherland features my Japanese roots-inspired music through a solo performance, set to footage shot during an artist residency in Kaga, Japan, during Summer 2019. It’s a series of instrumental tone-poems and immersive audio-visual moments to let your imagination play.\n\nThe collector of the super-NFT Motherland film will also receive **additional content** and an **equity share in the entire collection’s revenue** (more about that below). As well as sharing the project to share my art, I’m excited to experiment with different ways to present, share and incentivize music in the web3 space.\n\n***\\* Due to file size, please allow up to two minutes for the film to buffer before it plays***\n\n[auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?tokenId=3750](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?tokenId=3750)\n\n## The Film\n\nWe begin **Motherland** on the train ride to Kaga, and then on to an immersive journey of soundtracked sights following outdoor pathways to temples, rivers and lakes, accompanied by the sounds of nature and the eight compositions.\n\nThe footage of Japan featured in the film was shot in two locations - **Kakusenkei Gorge**, a beautiful forested valley with a river running between, and **Natadera Temple** - a Buddhist temple established in 714 AD with sprawling grounds, temple buildings and a distinct feeling of spiritual homeland. Along with the visuals, I’ve incorporated all the field-sound - the summer breeze rustling the trees, cicada song in the air, and the river’s running water. These create an integral connecting of the music with the visuals, and underpin the film with the sonic signature of nature.\n\nEach composition included in the film is introduced with *shodo* (traditional Japanese calligraphy) by visual artist **Kuniharu Yoshida**. The visual of the shodo and sight of Kuniharu’s hand in motion captures so much of the spirit of ancestry and roots which this project focuses on, and I’m grateful to have his contributions here.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AoIkXLj3xAHG5cTHi10qm.jpg?height=1348&width=2396)\n\n## The Music\n\n**Motherland** features eight instrumental compositions. Each piece has its own story - shared in storytime twitter threads:\n\n1. Motherland \\[[storytime](https://twitter.com/MdCL/status/1412113085381287942)\\]\n2.

The Offering \\[[storytime](https://twitter.com/MdCL/status/1409274446754377736)\\]\n\nMy performance was filmed in Los Angeles, utilizing my Ableton rig that, as well as emulating my first love - the piano, allows me to live-sample, play synths, program rhythms and essentially gives me a palette to paint whatever sounds I imagine. Where some of my work dives heavily into beat-culture and the dancefloor, Motherland is an introspective offering, leaning primarily on the sound of the piano and subtle use of electronics to tell the story.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vYH2K0udctxqI46gcBVIG.jpg?height=1324&width=2552)\n\n## The NFT Collection\n\nMotherland is a deeply personal project for me and it’s important to present it in a way that preserves this meaning. Shout-out to my friend [Sirsu](https://twitter.com/sirsuhayb) who helped me put this collection together and encouraged and supported me to enter the NFT space.\n\nThe collection consists of the super-NFT film, eight 1-of-1 individual-track audio NFTs, fifty open-edition digital mixtape NFTs and four (only 4!) hand-pressed, translucent vinyl commemorative pressings. No more vinyl will be pressed.\n\nThe winning collector of the **Motherland Film** **Super-NFT** will receive:\n\n* **the full-res film** digital file (non-commercial use only)\n* **individual WAV files** for all eight audio pieces (non-commercial use only)\n* edition #1 of the **hand-pressed translucent vinyl**\n* **equity share of all sales** of the audio NFTs consisting of: 5% royalty share on all eight 1-of-1 single-audio NFTs + 2% royalty share on the open edition Motherland digital mixtape NFTs\n\nEvery bidder on the **Motherland** **Film Super-NFT** will also go in a draw to win edition #2 of the hand-pressed translucent vinyl (to be drawn following a successful auction).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/w-kQfpxZKMfuUf2ADWTDs.jpg?height=1080&width=1080)\n\n## The 1-of-1 Audio NFTs\n\nEach of the film’s eight pieces of music has been minted as a 1-of-1 audio NFT. [Auctions hosted on Catalog/Zora](https://catalog.works/mdcl).\n\nEvery bidder on any of the audio NFTs will also go in a draw to win edition #3 of the hand-pressed translucent vinyl (to be drawn when all eight 1-of-1 audio NFT auctions close or one year after initial minting, whichever is sooner).\n\n5% of all sales of these NFTs will be credited to the collector of the film super-NFT.

Jesús de las ciudades, arrastrando campanas desde sus pies. ¿A quién le corresponde la linterna, en el agujero de esta noche?*\n\nDoblé la hoja manchada gravemente con mi sangre y la puse en un sobre en el que escribí inconscientemente la leyenda: “Caballo de batalla de tres patas”, lo más críptico que se me vino a la mente en ese instante. Sabía que le parecería intrigante. Me bañé, junté mis pertenencias y, con maleta en mano, caminé hacia su dormitorio y toqué a la puerta. Acto seguido, le entregué el sobre, mientras que él me ofreció el lienzo que desde hace mucho tenía preparado para mí. Nos abrazamos brevemente y nos despedimos. Desde aquel entonces no sé nada de él.\n\nAl final, desde lo más profundo de nuestras almas, ambos obtuvimos lo que deseábamos: yo el vacío que tanto anhelaba; y él, éxito con su óleo. Intentaré entrar a su inauguración y ver si Tim aún me reconoce…\n\nHasta me hace pensar en mi poder, recién descubierto con los conjuros, para explotarlo en el enigmático y surrealista Mercado de Sonora, sito en la Ciudad de México.", "timestamp": 1633458280, "digest": "M24Uq2NUBCQ8M77xLP2qsJN52SEr3kj8sYMcg2Te_c4", "contributor": "0x40dcd5c751864BF925F590f4F2Fb40AA0B17BB07"}

Questioning where we fit in, who our tribe is and how our identity meets the world. For me, this was the story of much of my life as a Japanese-New Zealander who was never Japanese enough to be Japanese, or white enough to be white. My teenage love of jazz, hip hop and drum’n’bass all stemmed from the same needs - these were music forms where I could find comfort and community through diving into albums created from artists’ own searches for belonging and identity: sonic offerings that decried the status quo and mainstream seeking something more. This premise has been my foundation as an artist - creating music that looks to answer my own inner questions and reflect the world I see, while knowing that emulating the status quo does little to help me understand my own past, present and future.\n\n**Motherland** is a 43-minute film, a meditative audio-visual exploration of my Japanese ancestry and culture. Presented as both a **super-NFT film** and **audio NFTs**, Motherland features my Japanese roots-inspired music through a solo performance, set to footage shot during an artist residency in Kaga, Japan, during Summer 2019. It’s a series of instrumental tone-poems and immersive audio-visual moments to let your imagination play.\n\nThe collector of the super-NFT Motherland film will also receive **additional content** and an **equity share in the entire collection’s revenue** (more about that below).

Along with the visuals, I’ve incorporated all the field-sound - the summer breeze rustling the trees, cicada song in the air, and the river’s running water. These create an integral connecting of the music with the visuals, and underpin the film with the sonic signature of nature.\n\nEach composition included in the film is introduced with *shodo* (traditional Japanese calligraphy) by visual artist **Kuniharu Yoshida**. The visual of the shodo and sight of Kuniharu’s hand in motion captures so much of the spirit of ancestry and roots which this project focuses on, and I’m grateful to have his contributions here.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AoIkXLj3xAHG5cTHi10qm.jpg?height=1348&width=2396)\n\n## The Music\n\n**Motherland** features eight instrumental compositions.

I had just immigrated to the states from a tiny, Indian village.\n\nMy dad was the first person in our family (a long history of farmers) to make it out of Gujarat, let alone India. He worked double shifts at Dunkin Donuts while attending community college night classes to become a mechanical engineer.\n\nHe made it. This taught me the importance of education. My parents had dreams of me becoming the first doctor in our entire family.\n\nI carried that hope with me for the next 15 years. I obsessed over grades and received instant gratification from my parents when I got As and was punished when I didn’t.\n\nI still remember the look of teary-eyed pride on my mother’s face when I got called in for a special ceremony for getting straight A’s in the 5th grade. Of course, my parents still kept the plaque:\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F513cf420-aa35-4c91-848f-1c158069546d_539x719.png)\n\nI still remember the day I graduated from ESL to normal english class. I had come a long way from a dirt-eating village boy.\n\nAnd I still remember the failures. When I got a C in 7th grade English (ugh Ms. Batts 😒), I was terrified. My parents would kill me. I scanned the report card, changed the grade using Microsoft Paint, and printed that out on laminated paper to avoid the repercussions.\n\nIt might be hard to wrap your head around this “grade-chasing” concept if you didn’t grow up with immigrant parents. They’ve been surrounded by poverty. They grew up chasing discounts and coupons (and still do), \\*never \\*ate out, and never travelled for leisure. They’ve dealt with risk and instability their whole lives.\n\nSo stability—from getting good grades to a high-paying job as a doctor, lawyer, or engineer at a big company—isn’t boring. This is their American dream.\n\n> \"The most damaging thing you learned in school wasn't something you learned in any specific class. It was learning to get good grades.\" - Paul Graham ([source](http://www.paulgraham.com/lesson.html))\n\nMy obsession over grades helped me get accepted to the top state school. And that’s where things started to fall apart.\n\nI fell in love with philosophy and started to hate the focus on rote memorization in my pre-med classes.  Rarely did I meet people who loved learning for learning’s sake.\n\nI remember the excitement I had felt walking into the first seminar for “History of the Neuron” deflate immediately when the professor started talking. Every single student around me was viciously banging away on their keyboards — transcribing every word — just in case his comments came up on the first exam.\n\nIt felt like I was playing a zero-sum game with smart, talented people all obsessing over GPAs and MCAT scores to inevitably fill a tiny number of [capped residency positions](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/more-medical-students-than-ever-but-more-residency-slots-needed-to-solve-physician).\n\nIt was the humanities where I found my true passion.\n\nThis all reached an inflection point in my senior year. I dropped out of school and figured I’d find my calling during a “gap year” — I could always finish my last semester afterwards. I was lucky enough to stumble my way into a seminar by Alexis Ohanian at UVa.\n\nHis talk changed my life. It was the first time I was exposed to the world of startups, including his experience reading Paul Graham essays and joining Y Combinator’s first batch. I’ll never forget his line: “A hundred years ago, you needed a factory & thousands of workers to start a company. Today, you just need to open your laptop.” But most importantly, I learned that “risk” could be a *good* thing.\n\nA month later, I was enrolled in [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/), a new online school that taught programming with 1:1 mentorship. I loved it and soon hustled my way into an internship—my pitch was effectively cheap labor for a year before I’d go back to UVa and finish up. I never went back.\n\nFrom day 1, I was thrown into the fire and had to learn everything from programming and sales to content marketing and profit margins. There were no grades. If I messed up, our students would get angry, and we’d lose money. This made me fall in love with learning. Small wins and the encouragement of my teammates boosted my self-confidence.\n\nI felt like Bradley Cooper in Limitless. I vividly remember telling the co-founders, “no one is stopping me from doing what I want here. It’s up to me to learn the skills and prove my value.”\n\nThis was a sharp departure from the structured, rigid environment I had been exposed to growing up. Founding your own startup or working for one is typically discouraged in immigrant communities—it involves way too much risk.\n\nAbout a year into the startup space, I was exposed to Carol Dweck, whose writing captured the transition I had been experiencing: from a “fixed mindset” to a “growth mindset”.\n\n> \"At the heart of what makes the “growth mindset” so winsome, Dweck found, is that it creates a passion for learning rather than a hunger for approval\" ([source](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/))\n\nOver-optimizing for a grade or test score kills this passion. It forces you into a mindset where you have to “[hack the test](http://www.paulgraham.com/lesson.html)” to win.\n\nChasing higher grades in school translates to chasing a higher salary as an adult.\n\nYou go to work to make money, not because you enjoy the work. But when it's your passion, you take the initiative to add your own improvisations and inventions.\n\nLearning for a better grade can’t compare to learning out of curiosity or learning through experimentation. Grade-based learning is anti-failure. You have one chance to get it right each time.\n\nSo, what’s a better framework for measuring progress towards a learning goal?\n\nI’ve been recently fascinated by “Shuhari”—a Japanese martial arts concept. It breaks down into three stages:\n\n* Shu (守) - traditional wisdom. The student follows the guidance of their teacher precisely. The focus is not on the underlying theory, but how to do the task at hand.\n* Ha (破) - breaking with tradition. Then, the student digs into the principles behind the technique. She starts integrating insights from other teachers into her own practice.\n* Ri (離) -  transcendence. Now, the student develops her own theory. She can design different techniques to suit her particular circumstances.\n\nOr basically:\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf1ccdb5-0f85-49d3-bb89-91b7efe35dac_998x1042.png)\n\nThe best jazz pianists are excellent improvisers, but learning instruction typically focuses on mastering techniques. In 1987, a group of academics [designed a new course](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED287756.pdf) leveraging mastery-based learning techniques that yielded strong results. The class mapped perfectly to Shuhari:\n\nShu: Learning how to play\n\n* “Knowledge of the jazz idiom consisted of the ability to define several jazz terms (blues, tritone substitute, etc.), the ability to name five jazz pianists and the ability to interpret several commonly used chord symbols”\n\nHa: Integrating different techniques\n\n* \"Students performed a jazz or popular tune of their choice using a walking bass line in the left hand and closed position seventh chords in the right.\"\n\nRi: Improvising\n\n* “Students improvised on a 12-bar blues in two different keys, a portion of \"Lover Man\", and a jazz or popular tune of their choice.”\n\nBy obsessing over grades (and techniques), you will never reach this “Ri” stage. That’s where the magic of innovation happens.\n\nWhen I started learning sales and customer development, I’d obsess over scripts and nailing down exact details and delivery. But with hundreds of calls under my belt, I tend to improvise now to drive organic conversation and new insights. I usually re-write entire “scripts” after 2–3 calls.\n\nCan you imagine how terrible it would be if every company thought about sales, design, or marketing the same way?\n\n[Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) is an interesting example. For years, the founders engrossed themselves in *every* single note-taking / knowledge-sharing app (*Shu*), learned to extract the most compelling ideas (*Ha*), and then started building heads-down for years.\n\nThey built an obsessive [cult](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23roamcult&src=typed_query) following, while ignoring most startup / SaaS advice:\n\nObvious value prop? Nope. Easy to use? Nope. Welcoming brand? Nope. Helpful onboarding? Nope. Intuitive file-and-cabinet structure? Hell no.\n\nReal breakthroughs only happen when you transcend consensus thinking (*Ri*).\n\nI’ve spent the last 6 years helping adults push past their own misconceptions of what they can and cannot learn. A year after a Thinkful graduate had started his job as a full-time engineer (and purchased a new home!), he shared this:\n\n> \"You are the first person to believe that I could do this, and because it was you, I believed it. I believed the program because of you.\"\n\nSean didn’t need my help. Frankly, he would have succeeded with *any* school. He was the hardest working student in his cohort. All he needed was someone to believe in him and break past the terrible stigmas about what is and isn’t possible.\n\nImposter syndrome is very real and a direct consequence of cultural stigma towards risk-taking paired with an outdated education system. This proliferates the “fixed mindset”.\n\nHelping people realize their potential has been and will continue to be a lifelong obsession of mine. Is there something you've always wanted to learn but felt like you couldn't? Maybe it was your method that failed, not you.\n\n*Special thanks to the [Foster](https://foster.co), Frédéric Renken, Danny Keller and Nathan Baschez for feedback.*", "timestamp": 1633459793, "digest": "fb2e48rNdBN4mR1Ugefz9j5wp42wvUxeweYVTd1YkEI", "contributor": "0xc7814D61A8236303a8854fc272cA0419A7e18E32"}

I had just immigrated to the states from a tiny, Indian village.\n\nMy dad was the first person in our family (a long history of farmers) to make it out of Gujarat, let alone India. He worked double shifts at Dunkin Donuts while attending community college night classes to become a mechanical engineer.\n\nHe made it. This taught me the importance of education. My parents had dreams of me becoming the first doctor in our entire family.\n\nI carried that hope with me for the next 15 years. I obsessed over grades and received instant gratification from my parents when I got As and was punished when I didn’t.\n\nI still remember the look of teary-eyed pride on my mother’s face when I got called in for a special ceremony for getting straight A’s in the 5th grade. Of course, my parents still kept the plaque:\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F513cf420-aa35-4c91-848f-1c158069546d_539x719.png)\n\nI still remember the day I graduated from ESL to normal english class. I had come a long way from a dirt-eating village boy.\n\nAnd I still remember the failures. When I got a C in 7th grade English (ugh Ms. Batts 😒), I was terrified. My parents would kill me. I scanned the report card, changed the grade using Microsoft Paint, and printed that out on laminated paper to avoid the repercussions.\n\nIt might be hard to wrap your head around this “grade-chasing” concept if you didn’t grow up with immigrant parents. They’ve been surrounded by poverty. They grew up chasing discounts and coupons (and still do), \\*never \\*ate out, and never travelled for leisure. They’ve dealt with risk and instability their whole lives.\n\nSo stability—from getting good grades to a high-paying job as a doctor, lawyer, or engineer at a big company—isn’t boring. This is their American dream.\n\n> \"The most damaging thing you learned in school wasn't something you learned in any specific class.

Watered-down ale or beer was generally preferred to London’s nasty river water.\n\nCoffee changed that. People were able to think more clearly and stay focused, spurring decades of economic growth. Coffeehouses, in particular, brought people and ideas together, inspiring countless innovations and discoveries. Conversation was the lifeblood.\n\nBusinessmen would hang out at Jonathan’s coffeehouse by the Royal Exchange, where the first stocks were traded. Stockbrokers met with merchants, ship captains, and cartographers at Lloyd’s coffeehouse to launch Britain’s insurance industry. Politicians debated at St. James and Westminster. Philosophers and clergy pondered at St. Paul’s Cathedral. Isaac Newton dissected a dolphin on the table of the Grecian Coffeehouse.\n\nCoffeehouses serve as an essential step in the evolution of learning communities.\n\n### Realizing Maslov’s hierarchy of needs\n\nSo, what exactly *is* a learning community? At its essence, it’s just a group of people who meet regularly to learn together and collaborate on a shared learning goal.\n\nBesides learning new things, why do people join them? At first, they help satisfy the third level in Maslov’s hierarchy of needs. They help us *belong*.\n\nBut that’s not enough.\n\nPeople want to belong to a community, *and* have status within it. They want Esteem, the second level in Maslov’s hierarchy of needs:\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32cdb7d0-7a9c-4aa7-9129-7fde11a23895_1262x702.png)\n\nLearning communities empower that.\n\nBy joining a learning community, you have a clear path towards earning status and recognition. Each member shares a common *learning* goal and when you make progress towards it, you feel respected. You keep pushing for new breakthroughs.\n\nLearning communities spur innovation.\n\n### Bell Labs: a classic learning community\n\nThe transistor — billions of which exist in the device you’re reading this post on.\n\nThe silicon solar cell — a precursor for all solar-powered devices.\n\nThe laser. Communication satellites. Information theory. Unix. C.\n\nAll these inventions started at Bell Labs.\n\nWhat made this place so special?  Mervin Kelly, a researcher turned chairman, was most responsible for fueling a culture of creativity.\n\nTo encourage a busy exchange of ideas, he needed a critical mass of talented people. At Bell Labs, Kelly housed thinkers and doers under one roof:\n\n> *Purposefully mixed together on the transistor project were physicists, metallurgists and electrical engineers; side by side were specialists in theory, experimentation and manufacturing. Like an able concert hall conductor, he sought a harmony, and sometimes a tension, between scientific disciplines; between researchers and developers; and between soloists and groups. ([source](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/innovation-and-the-bell-labs-miracle.html))*\n\nIt was basically impossible to walk down the (intentionally designed) hallway without running into fellow researchers or developers with interesting problems, diversions, and ideas.\n\nHate the idea of open spaces at your tech company? You can probably blame Mervin Kelly.\n\nFreedom to explore without overhead was also crucial for research-heavy projects. Kelly rarely checked in on progress until years after he gave his scientists the green light. He would likely scoff at the micro-managing tools we’ve built for project management today.\n\nAnd most importantly, Kelly trusted people to create and help one another. All employees at Bell Labs were asked to work with their doors open, making collaboration organic and inevitable.\n\nRichard Hamming, a retired Bells Labs scientist, delivered a speech in the mid-1980s to answer the question: “Why do so few scientists make significant contributions and so many are forgotten in the long run?”\n\n> *I notice that if you have the door to your office closed, you get more work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most.*\n>\n> *But 10 years later somehow you don't quite know what problems are worth working on; all the hard work you do is sort of tangential in importance.*\n>\n> *He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important. ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw))*\n\n### Trailblazing a new paradigm for education\n\nJohn Dewey, a leading educational theorist in the early 20th century, pioneered this social and experiential approach towards learning.\n\nHe believed education stifles individual autonomy when learners are taught that knowledge flows in one direction, from the expert to the learner.\n\nStudents thrive when they’re allowed to interact with the curriculum and take part in their own learning. To him, education and learning are fundamentally social and interactive processes.\n\n> The purpose of education should not revolve around the acquisition of a predetermined set of skills, but rather the realization of one's full potential and the ability to use those skills for the greater good. ([source](http://source/))\n\nHis ideas were met with stiff bureaucratic resistance in public schools. Unfortunately, that hasn’t changed much today.\n\nHow different would education look if public schools were built around Dewey’s philosophy? For one, we probably wouldn’t be [optimizing for grades](https://bhaumik.substack.com/p/optimizing-for-grades-kills-passion). And we probably wouldn’t be packing as many students as we could in a room:\n\n![Photo by Patric Fouad](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f447a93-c6a8-4680-b05b-f3a2660168bd_786x524.jpeg)\n\nMost of online learning faces the same problem. Teachable, Udemy, Thinkific, and others built a new business model by empowering individual educators, but the education itself hasn’t changed from the earliest MOOCs. Learning means pre-recorded lectures or text packaged together in a “course.” This is lonely and ineffective: MOOCs have a [97% dropout rate](https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2019/01/16/study-offers-data-show-moocs-didnt-achieve-their-goals).\n\nIf we flash forward half a century, you’ll see different implementations of student-driven [learning communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_community) across many US colleges. There’s an entire [textbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015YFJ8BM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) covering these experiments.\n\nAnd guess what? They seem to be working.\n\nStudents who participate in learning communities are more likely to persist to graduation ([source](https://search.proquest.com/openview/e89f789805de073b962825706372acf5/1?cbl=47847&pq-origsite=gscholar)), feel a strong sense of community and belonging ([source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1515/jsarp-2013-0022)), and have improved academic performance.\n\nBut these experiments are still quite limited. Take a look at [Purdue’s implementation](https://www.purdue.edu/learningcommunities/ras/what_is_a_learning_c.html) of learning communities. They basically ask a group of students who take the same 2 or 3 courses to live together and hangout. There’s a *lot* to be desired.\n\n### Hello, World!\n\nWelcome to the Internet — the largest, most accessible coffeehouse ever built.\n\nYou don’t have to put a group of ambitious people in the same room anymore.\n\nWe’re already all here. Hi 👋\n\nRegardless of how “niche” your interest is, there is someone out there who is just as fascinated with that topic. And not just some\\*one. \\*Probably a hundred! Maybe thousands!\n\nTake Reddit, for example. You can get brilliant insights in [r/AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/), geek out over the future in [r/Futurology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/), or laugh at (and probably get creeped by) muscular kangaroos in [r/kangabros](https://www.reddit.com/r/kangabros/).\n\nThere’s probably a passionate subreddit, Slack group, Twitter list, or newsletter for almost everything you want to learn.\n\nIn my next post, I’ll dive into examples of modern learning communities that bring Dewey’s ideas to life. Whether online or hybrid, free or paid, there are incredible applications in singing, vocational training, entrepreneurship, writing and you know, just having fun.\n\nAfterwards, I’ll write about where we’re headed 🔮\n\nWhat tools and companies are forming to make it easier to build learning communities? How can founders leverage the scale of technology \\*— \\*while retaining intimacy \\*— \\*to create new business models?\n\nHow can we use the internet to help people find a “sense of belonging” *and* earn recognition in the pursuit of a learning goal?\n\n\n---\n\n*Thanks to Foster, Frederic Renken, and Pujaa Rajan for feedback on this post.*\n\nRelated reading:\n\n* *Book: [A History of the World in 6 Glasses](https://www.amazon.com/History-World-6-Glasses/dp/0802715524/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1588121776&sr=1-1)*\n* *Book: [The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation](https://www.amazon.com/Idea-Factory-Great-American-Innovation/dp/0143122797)*\n* *Khan Academy’s research: [Building complex reasoning skills online through open-ended activities](https://early.khanacademy.org/open-ended/)*", "timestamp": 1633460275, "digest": "9fs65EM17qAhim8LARg5e0RKP1xVW7RXEuAd7JDEXno", "contributor": "0xc7814D61A8236303a8854fc272cA0419A7e18E32"}

{"id": "C3sLWSWbuBljKJOTbr3LAGSeeIj_ypa0Y53WRZVHD4Y", "title": "Windfall Prelude", "body": "**Prelude**\n\nI stood at the cusp of civilization, staring at its outer gates from the wrong side. The unadorned gray metal extended as far as my eyes could see, enclosing my world, my people, in a giant circle of rectangular pillars with no wiggle room between them, save for the gaps I knew laid bare in some regions. Omnipresent green light emanated from the pillars’ surface, rendering them visible against the night sky. They had always reminded me of bucked teeth.\n\nInside those gates was everything I ever knew. It was my home.\n\nOr had been.\n\n“Lenora here will be accompanying you until your trial is complete,” the Assemblyman said flatly. He stood before me with his hands in the pockets of his suit jacket. Against the pillar’s green light, I could make out the pin on his lapel that only Assemblymen wore.\n\nI squinted at him. “You think I’ll try to escape?”\n\nThe Assemblyman shot me a contemptuous look. “We heard what you did to Kara’s body. I don’t know what you’re dumb enough to try. If you do attempt to escape, I imagine there won’t be any need for a trial. The Wolves will kill you on sight.”\n\nI wanted to grab the smug prick’s face, but my hands were tied—literally. “I didn’t do it.”\n\nThe Assemblyman put a hand up. “Save it. You were the last one with her. There’s a hammer-shaped hole in her hotel room.”\n\nI shook my head. “It wasn’t me.”\n\n“Tell the Wolves that. Meanwhile, you jeopardized the first trade agreement between us and them in decades.”\n\nI gritted my teeth. “Can you at least send a message to my family?”\n\nThe Assemblyman sighed. He looked me up and down, and I thought I saw pity in his eyes. “Sure, kid.”\n\nI hated the pity I heard in his voice. It was as humiliating as the chains on my wrist and the black rags they clothed me with. “Tell them: I. Didn’t. Do. It.”\n\n“Alright, I’ve had enough.” He turned to the soldier who’d been standing silently next to him—Lenora, I guessed her name was. She looked like she was only a few years older than me, but she stood with the self-assuredness of someone much older. She was dressed in standard Military combat garb, and from what I could tell, armed to the teeth. “Take him to the ship.”\n\nLenora approached me until we were face-to-face. She was only an inch shorter than me, which put her at five-ten. Up close, her expression didn’t exactly make me think we’d be cracking jokes anytime soon. Her angular face was taught, her lips tight, her eyes fixated unsettlingly on mine.\n\n“Um, I’m Wyatt,” I said, feigning confidence. “I’d shake your hand, but,” I wiggled by handcuffs so that they jiggled noisily, “you know.”\n\nLenora stared at me in thick silence for another few seconds. Then she broke eye contact, turned, and walked away from civilization and into the grassy Wildlands.\n\nI gave the Assemblyman one last dirty look, followed by a respectful head bow towards my home. I tore my eyes away from the great pillars and found Lenora a few paces ahead of me. I ran to catch up, awkward with my unfree hands.\n\nAs we walked in silence, I looked around warily. The Wildlands was home to nightmares that knew nothing of Human law. I should know—as a soldier in the Military, part of my job was to fend off its Creatures when they tried to invade. Without the pillars’ light, it was hard to see anything in detail. Fortunately, the grass was short beneath our feet, and I knew from experience that the land was flat for miles. If anything bigger than a rodent came for us, we’d see it.\n\nNot that I could do much, at the moment.\n\nGod, I missed my hammer already.\n\nAfter several minutes, I started to make out the shape of something large in the distance. As we drew nearer, I recognized it. The ship had the same tubular shape, the same red-brown solid coloring, the same intimidating enormity as the one that Bogg and his daughter, Kara, had arrived in.\n\nI shuddered at the memories that threatened to replay in the forefront of my mind.\n\nThe envelope that Kara had given me.\n\nThe vomit-inducing scene of her headless body outside of her hotel room.\n\nBogg’s howls of loss, and his red-eyed, haunted expression that he beamed at me.\n\nThe cell they threw me in.\n\n“We’re ready,” Lenora said.\n\nI turned to her, thinking she was talking to me, but I shouldn’t have been so naïve. In my hazy thoughts, I hadn’t realized that we’d reached the ship. Up close, its beautiful details revealed themselves. The tube was coated in swirls of various shades of red, patterns whose underlying order I couldn’t quite discern but that my eyes found rather pleasing. From my angle, I could see a dozen or so windows on the right side of the tube, all sheathed from the outside. The wings that extended from the tube’s side were made of the same seemingly clayish substance that the rest of the ship was made of, and three rotating guns sat upon them, slowly reorienting themselves.\n\nUntil they pointed at me.\n\n“Good,” a gruff voice said. I tore my eyes from the ship towards the man standing before the ship’s nose. He was around six-two, and in the kind of shape I’d been hoping to be in after a couple years in the Military. He wore armor from head to toe, the same exact—and I mean *exact*—color as the ship. It appeared to be a single, continuous article, and yet as he walked towards us, the armor moved along with him as if it was another layer of skin. A utility belt hung around his waist, where a dagger and gun were both sheathed. Although his armor seemed to have no joints at which different components of armor connected, I did notice faint lines on his armor’s arms and breast. They closed in on themselves, delineating regions that jutted very slightly above the rest of the armor, as if they were lids on containers.\n\nI noticed an emblem sketched over the part of his armor that covered his belly button, as if someone had pressed into the clay-like material before the design had permanently hardened. It looked to be a pictograph of an index finger and thumb pinching down on a droplet of water. The entire image was embedded in a perfect circle.\n\nPoints of golden light shone from small bulbs on his shoulders and knees, providing enough light for me to see his face. The bridge of his nose was flatter than any Human’s, but his wide nostrils more than compensated. Even with his mouth closed, thin, fine fangs dangled from beneath his upper lip, falling nearly down past his chin. As with the only other two Wolves I’d ever seen, most of his face was covered in thick hair. Although his helmet hid the top of his head, curly black thickets fell to cover his forehead, and beard covered everything below his cheekbones. I guessed that his neck was just as hairy, but his armor shielded that bit of him, too.\n\nI nearly took a step backwards when I looked below his wild eyebrows. His eyes were mostly dark-brown, but silver freckles dotted his irises.\n\nI knew what those meant, even if he was a Wolf.   \n\n“Trip to the Builder’s Mountains won’t take long,” the Wolf said as he came within inches of us. “The pilot’s ready to go.” He extended an armored-coated hand. “Cain.”\n\nLenora took his hand. “I’m Lenora. Thanks for picking us up.”\n\nCain eyed me briefly before returning to Lenora. “The circumstances are most unfortunate, but the Mind of the Builder will rectify.”\n\n“What does that mean?” I blurted.\n\nLenora didn’t turn to me, but Cain did. He looked at me, his expression stone. But he said nothing. Instead, he turned around and slapped a hand on the nose of the ship. One of the ship’s windows seemed to grow wider, like an acid chewing up the clay around it. As it opened up, a ramp slid down from the floor from inside of the ship.\n\nLenora walked towards it without so much as asking me to follow her.\n\nI could’ve tried to run away then and there. I’d fought Creatures in the Wildlands before, I could do it again. I looked down at my handcuffs, and at my dirty hands. I hadn’t showered since they’d arrested me.\n\nI looked back at the ship’s wings, where its weapons were still pointed at me. Were they on? Would they shoot me on sight?\n\nI swallowed and ignored the fear that was gnawing its way through my insides. I took one last look at my empty, impotent, shaking hands.\n\n Then I followed Lenora into the ship, where I’d be taken to the world of the Wolves. Where an alien people would judge me for the murder of one of their own. Where they might choose to end my life.\n\nTo rectify, as Cain said.\n\nBut I didn’t join the Military because I’d roll over so easily.", "timestamp": 1633462196, "digest": "loMXiuG4K-ByMNYEZAvOjWwM1HhJqnp3xHEd1Lgv7lQ", "contributor": "0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC"}

{"id": "MbDwYWNPKMSwTtS9TlJ7xLg14v7-hn5wpqv21crjFqg", "title": "Windfall: Prelude", "body": "**Prelude**\n\nI stood at the cusp of civilization, staring at its outer gates from the wrong side. The unadorned gray metal extended as far as my eyes could see, enclosing my world, my people, in a giant circle of rectangular pillars with no wiggle room between them, save for the gaps I knew laid bare in some regions. Omnipresent green light emanated from the pillars’ surface, rendering them visible against the night sky. They had always reminded me of bucked teeth.\n\nInside those gates was everything I ever knew. It was my home.\n\nOr had been.\n\n“Lenora here will be accompanying you until your trial is complete,” the Assemblyman said flatly. He stood before me with his hands in the pockets of his suit jacket. Against the pillar’s green light, I could make out the pin on his lapel that only Assemblymen wore.\n\nI squinted at him. “You think I’ll try to escape?”\n\nThe Assemblyman shot me a contemptuous look. “We heard what you did to Kara’s body. I don’t know what you’re dumb enough to try. If you do attempt to escape, I imagine there won’t be any need for a trial. The Wolves will kill you on sight.”\n\nI wanted to grab the smug prick’s face, but my hands were tied—literally. “I didn’t do it.”\n\nThe Assemblyman put a hand up. “Save it. You were the last one with her. There’s a hammer-shaped hole in her hotel room.”\n\nI shook my head. “It wasn’t me.”\n\n“Tell the Wolves that. Meanwhile, you jeopardized the first trade agreement between us and them in decades.”\n\nI gritted my teeth. “Can you at least send a message to my family?”\n\nThe Assemblyman sighed. He looked me up and down, and I thought I saw pity in his eyes. “Sure, kid.”\n\nI hated the pity I heard in his voice. It was as humiliating as the chains on my wrist and the black rags they clothed me with. “Tell them: I. Didn’t. Do. It.”\n\n“Alright, I’ve had enough.” He turned to the soldier who’d been standing silently next to him—Lenora, I guessed her name was. She looked like she was only a few years older than me, but she stood with the self-assuredness of someone much older. She was dressed in standard Military combat garb, and from what I could tell, armed to the teeth. “Take him to the ship.”\n\nLenora approached me until we were face-to-face. She was only an inch shorter than me, which put her at five-ten. Up close, her expression didn’t exactly make me think we’d be cracking jokes anytime soon. Her angular face was taught, her lips tight, her eyes fixated unsettlingly on mine.\n\n“Um, I’m Wyatt,” I said, feigning confidence. “I’d shake your hand, but,” I wiggled by handcuffs so that they jiggled noisily, “you know.”\n\nLenora stared at me in thick silence for another few seconds. Then she broke eye contact, turned, and walked away from civilization and into the grassy Wildlands.\n\nI gave the Assemblyman one last dirty look, followed by a respectful head bow towards my home. I tore my eyes away from the great pillars and found Lenora a few paces ahead of me. I ran to catch up, awkward with my unfree hands.\n\nAs we walked in silence, I looked around warily. The Wildlands was home to nightmares that knew nothing of Human law. I should know—as a soldier in the Military, part of my job was to fend off its Creatures when they tried to invade. Without the pillars’ light, it was hard to see anything in detail. Fortunately, the grass was short beneath our feet, and I knew from experience that the land was flat for miles. If anything bigger than a rodent came for us, we’d see it.\n\nNot that I could do much, at the moment.\n\nGod, I missed my hammer already.\n\nAfter several minutes, I started to make out the shape of something large in the distance. As we drew nearer, I recognized it. The ship had the same tubular shape, the same red-brown solid coloring, the same intimidating enormity as the one that Bogg and his daughter, Kara, had arrived in.\n\nI shuddered at the memories that threatened to replay in the forefront of my mind.\n\nThe envelope that Kara had given me.\n\nThe vomit-inducing scene of her headless body outside of her hotel room.\n\nBogg’s howls of loss, and his red-eyed, haunted expression that he beamed at me.\n\nThe cell they threw me in.\n\n“We’re ready,” Lenora said.\n\nI turned to her, thinking she was talking to me, but I shouldn’t have been so naïve. In my hazy thoughts, I hadn’t realized that we’d reached the ship. Up close, its beautiful details revealed themselves. The tube was coated in swirls of various shades of red, patterns whose underlying order I couldn’t quite discern but that my eyes found rather pleasing. From my angle, I could see a dozen or so windows on the right side of the tube, all sheathed from the outside. The wings that extended from the tube’s side were made of the same seemingly clayish substance that the rest of the ship was made of, and three rotating guns sat upon them, slowly reorienting themselves.\n\nUntil they pointed at me.\n\n“Good,” a gruff voice said. I tore my eyes from the ship towards the man standing before the ship’s nose. He was around six-two, and in the kind of shape I’d been hoping to be in after a couple years in the Military. He wore armor from head to toe, the same exact—and I mean *exact*—color as the ship. It appeared to be a single, continuous article, and yet as he walked towards us, the armor moved along with him as if it was another layer of skin. A utility belt hung around his waist, where a dagger and gun were both sheathed. Although his armor seemed to have no joints at which different components of armor connected, I did notice faint lines on his armor’s arms and breast. They closed in on themselves, delineating regions that jutted very slightly above the rest of the armor, as if they were lids on containers.\n\nI noticed an emblem sketched over the part of his armor that covered his belly button, as if someone had pressed into the clay-like material before the design had permanently hardened. It looked to be a pictograph of an index finger and thumb pinching down on a droplet of water. The entire image was embedded in a perfect circle.\n\nPoints of golden light shone from small bulbs on his shoulders and knees, providing enough light for me to see his face. The bridge of his nose was flatter than any Human’s, but his wide nostrils more than compensated. Even with his mouth closed, thin, fine fangs dangled from beneath his upper lip, falling nearly down past his chin. As with the only other two Wolves I’d ever seen, most of his face was covered in thick hair. Although his helmet hid the top of his head, curly black thickets fell to cover his forehead, and beard covered everything below his cheekbones. I guessed that his neck was just as hairy, but his armor shielded that bit of him, too.\n\nI nearly took a step backwards when I looked below his wild eyebrows. His eyes were mostly dark-brown, but silver freckles dotted his irises.\n\nI knew what those meant, even if he was a Wolf.   \n\n“Trip to the Builder’s Mountains won’t take long,” the Wolf said as he came within inches of us. “The pilot’s ready to go.” He extended an armored-coated hand. “Cain.”\n\nLenora took his hand. “I’m Lenora. Thanks for picking us up.”\n\nCain eyed me briefly before returning to Lenora. “The circumstances are most unfortunate, but the Mind of the Builder will rectify.”\n\n“What does that mean?” I blurted.\n\nLenora didn’t turn to me, but Cain did. He looked at me, his expression stone. But he said nothing. Instead, he turned around and slapped a hand on the nose of the ship. One of the ship’s windows seemed to grow wider, like an acid chewing up the clay around it.

{"id": "VuIqR9X4PqYbGp0xALk4k34WZaVXIkG6fUZ6lYtgxVM", "title": "Windfall: Prelude", "body": "**Prelude**\n\nI stood at the cusp of civilization, staring at its outer gates from the wrong side. The unadorned gray metal extended as far as my eyes could see, enclosing my world, my people, in a giant circle of rectangular pillars with no wiggle room between them, save for the gaps I knew laid bare in some regions. Omnipresent green light emanated from the pillars’ surface, rendering them visible against the night sky. They had always reminded me of bucked teeth.\n\nInside those gates was everything I ever knew. It was my home.\n\nOr had been.\n\n“Lenora here will be accompanying you until your trial is complete,” the Assemblyman said flatly. He stood before me with his hands in the pockets of his suit jacket. Against the pillar’s green light, I could make out the pin on his lapel that only Assemblymen wore.\n\nI squinted at him. “You think I’ll try to escape?”\n\nThe Assemblyman shot me a contemptuous look. “We heard what you did to Kara’s body. I don’t know what you’re dumb enough to try. If you do attempt to escape, I imagine there won’t be any need for a trial. The Wolves will kill you on sight.”\n\nI wanted to grab the smug prick’s face, but my hands were tied—literally. “I didn’t do it.”\n\nThe Assemblyman put a hand up. “Save it. You were the last one with her. There’s a hammer-shaped hole in her hotel room.”\n\nI shook my head. “It wasn’t me.”\n\n“Tell the Wolves that. Meanwhile, you jeopardized the first trade agreement between us and them in decades.”\n\nI gritted my teeth. “Can you at least send a message to my family?”\n\nThe Assemblyman sighed. He looked me up and down, and I thought I saw pity in his eyes. “Sure, kid.”\n\nI hated the pity I heard in his voice. It was as humiliating as the chains on my wrist and the black rags they clothed me with. “Tell them: I. Didn’t. Do. It.”\n\n“Alright, I’ve had enough.” He turned to the soldier who’d been standing silently next to him—Lenora, I guessed her name was. She looked like she was only a few years older than me, but she stood with the self-assuredness of someone much older. She was dressed in standard Military combat garb, and from what I could tell, armed to the teeth. “Take him to the ship.”\n\nLenora approached me until we were face-to-face. She was only an inch shorter than me, which put her at five-ten. Up close, her expression didn’t exactly make me think we’d be cracking jokes anytime soon. Her angular face was taught, her lips tight, her eyes fixated unsettlingly on mine.\n\n“Um, I’m Wyatt,” I said, feigning confidence. “I’d shake your hand, but,” I wiggled by handcuffs so that they jiggled noisily, “you know.”\n\nLenora stared at me in thick silence for another few seconds. Then she broke eye contact, turned, and walked away from civilization and into the grassy Wildlands.\n\nI gave the Assemblyman one last dirty look, followed by a respectful head bow towards my home. I tore my eyes away from the great pillars and found Lenora a few paces ahead of me. I ran to catch up, awkward with my unfree hands.\n\nAs we walked in silence, I looked around warily. The Wildlands was home to nightmares that knew nothing of Human law. I should know—as a soldier in the Military, part of my job was to fend off its Creatures when they tried to invade. Without the pillars’ light, it was hard to see anything in detail. Fortunately, the grass was short beneath our feet, and I knew from experience that the land was flat for miles. If anything bigger than a rodent came for us, we’d see it.\n\nNot that I could do much, at the moment.\n\nGod, I missed my hammer already.\n\nAfter several minutes, I started to make out the shape of something large in the distance. As we drew nearer, I recognized it. The ship had the same tubular shape, the same red-brown solid coloring, the same intimidating enormity as the one that Bogg and his daughter, Kara, had arrived in.\n\nI shuddered at the memories that threatened to replay in the forefront of my mind.\n\nThe envelope that Kara had given me.\n\nThe vomit-inducing scene of her headless body outside of her hotel room.\n\nBogg’s howls of loss, and his red-eyed, haunted expression that he beamed at me.\n\nThe cell they threw me in.\n\n“We’re ready,” Lenora said.\n\nI turned to her, thinking she was talking to me, but I shouldn’t have been so naïve. In my hazy thoughts, I hadn’t realized that we’d reached the ship. Up close, its beautiful details revealed themselves. The tube was coated in swirls of various shades of red, patterns whose underlying order I couldn’t quite discern but that my eyes found rather pleasing. From my angle, I could see a dozen or so windows on the right side of the tube, all sheathed from the outside. The wings that extended from the tube’s side were made of the same seemingly clayish substance that the rest of the ship was made of, and three rotating guns sat upon them, slowly reorienting themselves.\n\nUntil they pointed at me.\n\n“Good,” a gruff voice said. I tore my eyes from the ship towards the man standing before the ship’s nose. He was around six-two, and in the kind of shape I’d been hoping to be in after a couple years in the Military. He wore armor from head to toe, the same exact—and I mean *exact*—color as the ship. It appeared to be a single, continuous article, and yet as he walked towards us, the armor moved along with him as if it was another layer of skin. A utility belt hung around his waist, where a dagger and gun were both sheathed. Although his armor seemed to have no joints at which different components of armor connected, I did notice faint lines on his armor’s arms and breast. They closed in on themselves, delineating regions that jutted very slightly above the rest of the armor, as if they were lids on containers.\n\nI noticed an emblem sketched over the part of his armor that covered his belly button, as if someone had pressed into the clay-like material before the design had permanently hardened. It looked to be a pictograph of an index finger and thumb pinching down on a droplet of water. The entire image was embedded in a perfect circle.\n\nPoints of golden light shone from small bulbs on his shoulders and knees, providing enough light for me to see his face. The bridge of his nose was flatter than any Human’s, but his wide nostrils more than compensated. Even with his mouth closed, thin, fine fangs dangled from beneath his upper lip, falling nearly down past his chin. As with the only other two Wolves I’d ever seen, most of his face was covered in thick hair. Although his helmet hid the top of his head, curly black thickets fell to cover his forehead, and beard covered everything below his cheekbones. I guessed that his neck was just as hairy, but his armor shielded that bit of him, too.\n\nI nearly took a step backwards when I looked below his wild eyebrows. His eyes were mostly dark-brown, but silver freckles dotted his irises.\n\nI knew what those meant, even if he was a Wolf.\n\n“Trip to the Builder’s Mountains won’t take long,” the Wolf said as he came within inches of us. “The pilot’s ready to go.” He extended an armored-coated hand. “Cain.”\n\nLenora took his hand. “I’m Lenora. Thanks for picking us up.”\n\nCain eyed me briefly before returning to Lenora. “The circumstances are most unfortunate, but the Mind of the Builder will rectify.”\n\n“What does that mean?” I blurted.\n\nLenora didn’t turn to me, but Cain did. He looked at me, his expression stone. But he said nothing. Instead, he turned around and slapped a hand on the nose of the ship. One of the ship’s windows seemed to grow wider, like an acid chewing up the clay around it. As it opened up, a ramp slid down from the floor from inside of the ship.\n\nLenora walked towards it without so much as asking me to follow her.\n\nI could’ve tried to run away then and there. I’d fought Creatures in the Wildlands before, I could do it again. I looked down at my handcuffs, and at my dirty hands. I hadn’t showered since they’d arrested me.\n\nI looked back at the ship’s wings, where its weapons were still pointed at me. Were they on? Would they shoot me on sight?\n\nI swallowed and ignored the fear that was gnawing its way through my insides. I took one last look at my empty, impotent, shaking hands.\n\nThen I followed Lenora into the ship, where I’d be taken to the world of the Wolves. Where an alien people would judge me for the murder of one of their own. Where they might choose to end my life.\n\nTo rectify, as Cain said.\n\nBut I didn’t join the Military because I’d roll over so easily.\n\n[crowdfund://0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC?features=](crowdfund://0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC?features=)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633462498, "digest": "5DnBsKtD4yIIEa60bRulvdgv24FkMEy0nIFSlB5I3pc", "contributor": "0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC"}
{"id": "4I326POeHjDc0x1tu2WQQhyai-3Il4FiBc1EF2RFUUM", "title": "Hello world", "body": "Hey, I’m Typto, a dreamer.\n\nI use to be a dreamer of music, film, and then I became a dreamer of DAO when I couldn't find my way in the old world. That's 2019.\n\nBut I'm still confused. I was standing alone in a strange new world.\n\nFortunately, I met [Pet3r_Pan](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_), he brought me into an amazing new world. The people here are sincere, friendly, classless, helpful, and selfless. Most of all, they are very funny! They are [MetaCartel](https://twitter.com/Meta_Cartel), my family.\n\nMore importantly, Pet3r_Pan has taught me a lot and given me a lot of opportunities. If I have achieved anything today, I owe it all to Pet3r_Pan.\n\nWith Pet3r’s help, I started to work for my dream. \n\nBefore I met Peter, I thought of many things I can do, including a media platform. But when I met Peter for the first time and heard his story about MetaCartel, especially after I joined them, I realized that the things I thought were pretty lame. Because all those things were just for me. I should be doing something for others, for community, for ecosystem, for our world. Do something more meaningful and valuable. I reminisced about my experiences in the music and film industries, and the entrepreneurs and commuters I met in 2019. They had dreams, but they didn't have any solutions. Absolutely, DAO can help them.\n\nSo I knew what I should do. To help more people realize their dreams through DAO. Help those who have talent but no background. Help those who are not good at flattery and just want to be true to themselves.\n\nIt's hard, especially where I am. Cultural, social, and historical factors make this no easy task. I thought an incubator based on the DAO concept was a sustainable way to make the dream a reality.\n\nBut I needed to consider two equally important things at the same time: **business** and **value proposition**. It was hard and I needed to find the balance. At the same time, I needed to handle those team annoyances. Since December 2019, many members have joined and many have left. I have been ecstatic about the addition of these people. I've also been frustrated by the people leaving. Fortunately, instead of sinking, we are getting stronger.\n\nBut we are still far from success. We need to continue to work hard for business while staying true to our value proposition. It's hard, but I'm no longer alone now. I believe we can overcome anything. I believe we can build a real community for those dreamers, those who have talent but no background, those who aren't good at flattery and just want to be true to themselves. Helping them to be successful. I believe.\n\nThis's the story of [DAOSquare](https://twitter.com/DAOSquare) and me.\n\nI am 41 years old. I don't have enough time left compared to the people around me. I hope to realize my dream sooner, or, after I'm gone, have a solid community that will carry it forward.\n\nI’m Typto, the summoner of DAOSquare. If you have the same dream, please join us!", "timestamp": 1633462538, "digest": "5lJ9pPR_V9_GDp3OjDQzWW9Lyx-u3e4hh71rRj96VSg", "contributor": "0x9ac9c636404C8d46D9eb966d7179983Ba5a3941A"}

{"id": "AOzOyYPkLwV3IoxNAlapK1vMVOq0UZhTrbTKLJtgLNk", "title": "Windfall: Chapter One", "body": "Chapter One\n\n*Six days earlier…*\n\n“You gonna eat that?”\n\nI looked up at Benjamin, who was staring eagerly at the untouched turkey leg on my plate. “Go for it, champ.”\n\nHe grabbed it with his bare hands and gnawed on the leg like a starved vulture. “God, that’s disgusting,” I muttered.\n\n“You really should slow down and learn some etiquette,” Aiden said, who was sitting to Benjamin’s right. “We’re lucky to be at such a formal occasion.”\n\nBenjamin tried speaking with his mouth full, but I interrupted. “Don’t, dude. You start spitting across the table, and they’ll definitely kick us out.”\n\nThe brute rolled his eyes but obliged. I shared a look with Aiden, and we shook our heads in unison.\n\nThe three of us sat at a roundtable by the hall’s back wall, having chosen one of the dozen or so that had been assigned to Soldiers. Some other rookies sat alongside us, but I think Benjamin’s savagery kept them from chatting us up.\n\nI scanned the room and guessed that there were around two-hundred people enjoying the buffet. Military members were easy to pick out, since they wore star-shaped pins on their otherwise formal attire. We were told not to wear our combat gear for the banquet, but that we were encouraged to bring a weapon or two.\n\nMy naked sledgehammer dangled from my belt.\n\n“I recognize some of the Philosophers here,” Aiden said. She nodded towards a table several rows closer to the room’s dais than we were. “See them? They write about the nature of laws.”\n\nI looked over at Aiden. She was pale, skinny, and her white-blonde hair somehow reminded me of dying grass. “Why would they be invited to this?”\n\nAiden smiled, her green eyes darting excitedly. “The Wolves make things that Humans could never dream to. I’m sure they’re interested.”\n\nI shrugged my shoulders so that my jacket fell back into place. It was a little big for me, but Mom tried her best. I hated dressing like this. If I wanted to dress up for work, I would’ve joined the ranks of Commerce. “Yeah, well, all that thinking won’t help if the Wolves decide the buffet isn’t cutting it.”\n\nBenjamin let loose a thunderous burp, which earned looks of horror by the other rookies at the table. “I’m with Wyatt. You can’t trust an animal.”\n\n“Didn’t some horde of Wolves try to raid Polygon just last week?” I added.\n\n“Yeah,” Aiden said diffidently, “but those were from the Wildlands. This is different.”\n\n“Uh-huh,” Benjamin muttered. “Don’t see any Humans living in the Wildlands.” He tapped Aiden’s nose. “Don’t be naïve, sweetie. It’ll get you killed.”\n\nAiden grabbed Benjamin’s finger and tossed it away. “Not all problems can be solved with a gun. Read a book, ogre.”\n\n“Books didn’t help me last month against those rhinos,” Benjamin retorted. “Wyatt was there, he’ll tell you. Wyatt?”\n\nI’d only been half-listening to my friends’ banter. My eyes were locked with a man walking towards our table. “What? Sure. Hey, I think Lieutenant Roderick is headed our way.”\n\nEveryone at the table straightened up at that, including me. I had more reason than the others—Roderick was \\*my \\*Lieutenant, my direct commander.\n\n“Hey,” he said when he reached me.\n\nI kept eye contact and prayed that I didn’t have food on the sides of my mouth. “Sir.”\n\n“Come find me after the ceremony. I have a job for you.”\n\nI suppressed the excitement and curiosity that threatened to leak through my face. “Yessir.”\n\nWith a nod, the strong-jawed Lieutenant walked away. The rest of the rookies at the table looked at me, but I ignored them. Once Roderick was out of earshot, I whispered to Benjamin and Aiden, “Guess I’m his favorite.”\n\nBenjamin snorted. “He probably wants you on cleaning duty.”\n\n“You don’t think an event like this is already covered by the Assembly?” I retorted. “No way. This’ll be something interesting.”\n\nThe background chatter of the room suddenly died. I looked towards the dais to see a bald, round man, dressed in an ocean-blue suit and white shirt, standing alone at its center. It was difficult to make out the pin on his jacket lapel, but I already knew what it was—a metallic square with three squiggly horizontal lines etched on its surface. The symbol of Humanity, of Polygon, of our leadership class.\n\nWe’d had the honor of meeting this man on our last day of training, when we were officially inaugurated into the Military. Clovis, the First Assemblyman, second in political authority only to the Ruler himself.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen!” Clovis said cheerfully into a small microphone that ran from his ear down to his mouth. “I thank you all for attending this most historic event. For thousands of years, we have lived our lives in Polygon as an isolated people. And we’ve been good at it. Our art flourishes.” He gestured at the right-hand wall, on which hung a large painting of hooded Philosophers buried in books. “Our men and women of Commerce ensure that our people’s needs are satisfied. Our Industry folk keep Polygon running without fail. And, of course, our Military keeps the peace, both within our walls and without them.”\n\n“He’s buttering up the crowd,” I muttered to my friends. “He knows working with Wolves is a tough sell.”\n\nAiden put a finger to her lips.\n\nBenjamin was right. I didn’t know how she made the cut.\n\n“But there is more to the world than Polygon. Many of you may not know this, but the Wolves have engineered some of the most astonishing creations I have ever seen. I’ve been there myself. Their world is one of gears and chemicals and things as magical as Godlets themselves. And while I’m proud of what Humankind has achieved, we can benefit from those on the other side of the continent.\n\n“The last trade with Wolves that the Assembly approved of was over thirty years ago. Many in this room will not have remembered it, and not only because there are so many young faces in attendance. It hardly lasted more than a week. Complications…arose.” The First Assemblyman clasped his hands together and smiled devilishly, as if he were about to land a punchline. “But failures of the past do not compel us to relinquish possibilities of the future. With *The Principles of Earth and Blood*, we are boundless.”\n\nHe paused, and everyone clapped to fill the brief silence.\n\n“Now, please welcome our guest of honor as he joins me. Bogg is a renowned mogul at the Builder’s Mountains. He has brought his daughter, Kara, along with him. A round of applause, please!”\n\nWhile we obliged his request, two figures entered the dais from behind its back curtain and stood by Clovis. Both wore elegant white outfits that I nearly mistook for bathrobes, but the fabric was far finer than anything I’d wear on a lazy morning, and their clothes shone as brightly as snow under the sun. Odder than their stylistic choice was that the clothing was literally *moving*—their tops gently rippled from left to right, as if dozens of tiny ocean waves were rolling underneath in rapid, successive, rhythmic fashion.\n\nBoth of them wore jewelry from head to toe, each ornament cut from a different gem. Their dangling, blood-red earrings and their sparkling, gray bracelets rotated in perfect harmony with the mechanical dance of their robes. More than half of their fingers were decorated with gemstone rings. Those, at least, stood still.\n\nTheir faces…my hand instinctively went to my hammer as I took them in, man and girl. Both were utterly covered in what looked like billions of thin whiskers. It was almost disgusting to look at. The larger man’s hair was mostly dark gray with a few dashes of white interspersed from his dome to his mane. The girl’s hair was similar in character, but it was the yellow-green of spring leaves.\n\n*She-Wolves have beards. Noted.*\n\nTheir fangs extended down what I guessed was past their chins, but they were too hairy—or too whiskery—to tell. While the man-Wolf was definitely lean for his size, the girl was definitely too skinny to be healthy. Even with all of that hair, I could see her sunken cheeks.\n\nAs our applause died down, the taller of the pair offered a deep, long bow. “Hello to you all,” he boomed in a deep, confident voice. “My daughter and I thank you for your hospitality. I’ve already met some of you when we landed earlier today. My name is Bogg, and this is Kara.”\n\nThe girl waved to the crowd with both hands, as if trying to make a joke. She stumbled forward, and for a second, I thought she’d trip over her feet.\n\nBogg’s gaze never left us, and he continued unabated. “My team and I have been in communication with Clovis and his cohort for years, ironing out the details of this deal. The Great Builder has granted all of us most fortuitous circumstances. You see, I have learned that underneath Polygon may rest undiscovered veins of metals and other valuable materials. If I understand correctly, you all use much of this metal for what you call ‘money’. But we don’t have this ‘money’ in the Builder’s Mountains. We employ the Great Builder’s seeds towards far more creative ends. With his gifts, we fertilize the world.”\n\nI frowned. *Was that a dig at us?*\n\nI noticed other faces turn sour, too.\n\nBut Bogg either didn’t notice, or he didn’t care. “We have had toys that sniff out the earth’s riches long before I came into contact with your people. We call them ‘metal detectors’. With knowledge of how Polygon runs, my team created a specialized device just for you, your own artificial bug. But I digress. I won’t bore you with details here, nor with a demonstration. Roderick and the rest of your Assembly have already seen its efficacy.\n\n“Your men of Industry will receive shipments of my toys. It has been agreed upon that I will receive some modest fraction of any metals that my bugs discover for you.” Bogg paused. “This is—”\n\nKara took a wobbly step forward, and an explosion of bile and chunks of who-knows-what rocketed from her mouth.\n\nBenjamin yelled profanity, but it was drowned out by the hundred other yells of shock. I looked wide-eyed towards my friends. “She’s drunk,” I muttered. “Guess booze hits Wolves the same way it hits us.”\n\n“Okay, okay!” Clovis shouted, as Bogg grabbed his daughter by the arm and quickly fell back behind the curtain from which they came. “I’m terribly sorry, friends. Kara must be unwell. In any case, I thank you all for attending once again. Have a good night, everyone.”\n\nPeople immediately began shuffling out of the hall. I saw staff who had been silently standing against the walls begin to clean up the place, including the vomit on the dais.\n\n“That was weird,” Aiden said as the three of us rose to our feet.\n\n“Yep,” Benjamin muttered. “This guy’s supposed to be our friend, or something? He brought his drunk daughter to his welcome ceremony. He’s spitting in our faces.”\n\n“No,” Aiden responded. “I mean, I’ve read about the Wolves. They normally raise their children communally. It’s odd that Bogg has a daughter of his own at all.”\n\n“Guess your books don’t have all the answers, after all,” Benjamin teased.\n\n“I *did* know that Wolves don’t have a currency,” Aiden protested.\n\nI put my fist out. “Much as I’d love to stick around, I’m gonna find Lieutenant Roderick. I’ll see you back at the hotel.”\n\nMy friends took turns bumping my fist, and I headed towards the table I had seen Roderick sitting at. When I turned his way, I saw that everyone at his table had already left, except him.\n\nHe was waiting for me.\n\n“Uh, sir,” I said as I approached his backside. “You wanted to see me?”\n\nRoderick turned his head but remained seated and utterly still. “Sit for a second, Wyatt.”\n\nI did, and I turned my chair so that we were face-to-face. “What can I do for you?”\n\nThe Lieutenant’s dimples showed as he held back a grin. “Some ceremony, eh?”\n\n“Seems like the Assembly will approve the deal.”\n\nRoderick laughed. “Relax, Wyatt. It’s just you and me here.” Now his face did break out in a flashy smile. “What do you really think?”\n\n“I, um…” I broke eye contact with my commander. “Sorry, I don’t know what to say, sir.”\n\n“Hey, kid, listen to me. Look at me. You’re, what, nineteen-years-old? You’ve been in the Military for less than a year. I’ve seen you in training. In action. You’ve got more drive than most rookies I’ve come across.”\n\nI looked back at Roderick and did my best to suppress the elation that wanted to leap out of my throat. “Really?”\n\nRoderick winked at me and nodded. “Between you and me. You’re passionate about your job. How long have you wanted to join the Military?”\n\n“I never considered another profession, sir.”\n\n“Figured as much. You could go a long way, kid. I see it. And I’m in your camp. Know that.”\n\n“I appreciate that. I…don’t know what to say.”\n\nHis playful expression again broke out in a chuckle. “You said that already. Now, I ask again: what did you think of that ceremony?”\n\n“Well…I don’t understand why Bogg would bring his daughter out if she’s such a liability.”\n\nRoderick nodded. “Go on.”\n\n“I don’t know what’s going on with—what was her name, Kara? If Bogg wanted to earn our trust or respect, why would he have brought his drunk daughter onto the dais? Unless his judgment is that poor, in which case we shouldn’t be trading with him in the first place. Or maybe he did it on purpose, to spit in our face. It’s dicey enough working with any Wolf, let alone a stupid or malevolent one.”\n\n“Why is that?”\n\nMy nerves had faded away, and I leaned closer towards my Lieutenant. “Humans should stick to our own. Things are good enough at Polygon. Clovis said it himself. Why entangle ourselves with another race?” I shook my head. “They’re not worth it.”\n\n“There it is,” Roderick said approvingly. “I might agree with you, kid. But you know, maybe Bogg’s technology will land us gold. More money is never a bad thing. I don’t know, honestly. I hadn’t heard about the details until his speech.”\n\n“He was mocking us,” I snapped. “He called his own technology ‘toys’ several times. Like we’re just receiving the bottom of the barrel. Screw him and his drunk daughter.”\n\n“Okay, okay!” Roderick held his hands up teasingly. “I hear you. I don’t like working with them, either.” He shrugged his shoulders. “But you’re wrong about one thing, Wyatt. Things can \\*always \\*get better.”\n\n“Yeah well,” I muttered. “I guess we’ll see.”\n\n“And speaking of his ‘drunk daughter’, as you called her. That’s why I wanted to talk to you.”\n\nI sat back in my chair. “Oh?”\n\nRoderick cocked his head and looked vaguely puzzled. “You were in attendance when their ship landed earlier today. I know the two of them exited very quickly and were escorted away, but did you by any chance make eye contact with Kara?”\n\nI pursed my lips. “Not at all. To be totally honest, I barely looked at them.”\n\n“Not curious to see what a Wolf looked like? I know you hadn’t seen one yet, out in the Wildlands.”\n\n“Nope. Not at all. They’re not us.”\n\nRoderick snorted. “Fair enough. And you’ve been in my sights for the last few hours. You couldn’t have interacted with her since then.”\n\n“Sir, what’s this about?”\n\n“She wants a night out on the town. Apparently she wants to check out the Capital’s bar scene. From what I’m told, she requested you as her tour guide.”\n\nI frowned. “What? That’s my task?”\n\nRoderick nodded. “Yeah. Not the sexiest order I’ll give you, but there it is. They’re our guests, so it’s not really our call.”\n\n“No, I get that. Bogg’s going to let her out after that debacle? How old is she, anyway?”\n\n“I don’t know. Couple years younger than you, I guess, though the beard makes it hard to tell.”\n\nI ran a hand through my hair, unsure how to react. “I…don’t like this. I don’t want to talk to these Wolves. I definitely don’t want to babysit some drunk.”\n\n“I get it. Think of it as security service. I don’t know how these Wolves choose to live, and I certainly wouldn’t let my kid out after humiliating me. Who knows, maybe that’s going to be the case. Before the ceremony, my superior had told Bogg that you’d meet her outside her hotel at nine p.m. Maybe she won’t show. But if she does, you’re there to protect her.”\n\nI grinned at my Lieutenant. “I do like that better than babysitting.”\n\nHe lightly punched me in the arm. “There you go. Oh, and don’t change your clothes. Let’s keep a professional face.”\n\n“Definitely.”\n\n“Do you know where \\*No Rules \\*is? It’s a high-end bar just a few blocks from where Kara and Bogg are staying.”\n\nI nodded. “Yeah. I’ve never gone in, though. Last time I was in the Capital was when we passed our training. My friends and I celebrated in the area.”\n\n“I’m sure you did. Here.”\n\nRoderick pulled out something from his jacket pocket and handed me half a dozen heavy golden coins. I looked at them and saw the same insignia inscribed on them that was on Clovis’ pin. I whistled. “This isn’t your money, is it?”\n\n“Of course not. I like you, but not that much. The Assembly’s covering whatever Kara wants tonight.”\n\n“I won’t drink,” I assured him.\n\nHe smiled proudly at me. “I know you won’t. Look, I know it won’t be the most fun job, but I’ll make sure people know you did it well.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. Do you know why she chose me?”\n\nRoderick rose to his feet, and I followed suit. He extended a rough, calloused hand to me. I met his grip. “You have an hour to yourself before you’re on duty. I have no idea why she insisted on you, but you can ask her. Might be a good way to bypass small talk, anyway. Good luck, Wyatt. I’ll see you in the morning.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. For everything. I won’t let you down.”\n\nWith one last charming grin, my commander walked away and left the banquet hall.\n\nI looked around and realized that no one was left but the cleaning crew and me. I closed my eyes and took a breath.\n\n*One night. One Wolf. One job.*\n\n*I got this.*\n\n[crowdfund://0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC?features=](crowdfund://0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC?features=)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633463029, "digest": "-ZT4iVRC3bVUOqsfWwttGNUG0Ldj3WezA1jRv7kL8SA", "contributor": "0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC"}

{"id": "-_D3nSo4qtSoHlxDLWnNia_eigZP6tNLPYpTvOimTts", "title": "Windfall: Chapter One", "body": "Chapter One\n\n*Six days earlier…*\n\n“You gonna eat that?”\n\nI looked up at Benjamin, who was staring eagerly at the untouched turkey leg on my plate. “Go for it, champ.”\n\nHe grabbed it with his bare hands and gnawed on the leg like a starved vulture. “God, that’s disgusting,” I muttered.\n\n“You really should slow down and learn some etiquette,” Aiden said, who was sitting to Benjamin’s right. “We’re lucky to be at such a formal occasion.”\n\nBenjamin tried speaking with his mouth full, but I interrupted. “Don’t, dude. You start spitting across the table, and they’ll definitely kick us out.”\n\nThe brute rolled his eyes but obliged. I shared a look with Aiden, and we shook our heads in unison.\n\nThe three of us sat at a roundtable by the hall’s back wall, having chosen one of the dozen or so that had been assigned to Soldiers. Some other rookies sat alongside us, but I think Benjamin’s savagery kept them from chatting us up.\n\nI scanned the room and guessed that there were around two-hundred people enjoying the buffet. Military members were easy to pick out, since they wore star-shaped pins on their otherwise formal attire. We were told not to wear our combat gear for the banquet, but that we were encouraged to bring a weapon or two.\n\nMy naked sledgehammer dangled from my belt.\n\n“I recognize some of the Philosophers here,” Aiden said. She nodded towards a table several rows closer to the room’s dais than we were. “See them? They write about the nature of laws.”\n\nI looked over at Aiden. She was pale, skinny, and her white-blonde hair somehow reminded me of dying grass. “Why would they be invited to this?”\n\nAiden smiled, her green eyes darting excitedly. “The Wolves make things that Humans could never dream to. I’m sure they’re interested.”\n\nI shrugged my shoulders so that my jacket fell back into place. It was a little big for me, but Mom tried her best. I hated dressing like this. If I wanted to dress up for work, I would’ve joined the ranks of Commerce. “Yeah, well, all that thinking won’t help if the Wolves decide the buffet isn’t cutting it.”\n\nBenjamin let loose a thunderous burp, which earned looks of horror by the other rookies at the table. “I’m with Wyatt. You can’t trust an animal.”\n\n“Didn’t some horde of Wolves try to raid Polygon just last week?” I added.\n\n“Yeah,” Aiden said diffidently, “but those were from the Wildlands. This is different.”\n\n“Uh-huh,” Benjamin muttered. “Don’t see any Humans living in the Wildlands.” He tapped Aiden’s nose. “Don’t be naïve, sweetie. It’ll get you killed.”\n\nAiden grabbed Benjamin’s finger and tossed it away. “Not all problems can be solved with a gun. Read a book, ogre.”\n\n“Books didn’t help me last month against those rhinos,” Benjamin retorted. “Wyatt was there, he’ll tell you. Wyatt?”\n\nI’d only been half-listening to my friends’ banter. My eyes were locked with a man walking towards our table. “What? Sure. Hey, I think Lieutenant Roderick is headed our way.”\n\nEveryone at the table straightened up at that, including me. I had more reason than the others—Roderick was \\*my \\*Lieutenant, my direct commander.\n\n“Hey,” he said when he reached me.\n\nI kept eye contact and prayed that I didn’t have food on the sides of my mouth. “Sir.”\n\n“Come find me after the ceremony. I have a job for you.”\n\nI suppressed the excitement and curiosity that threatened to leak through my face. “Yessir.”\n\nWith a nod, the strong-jawed Lieutenant walked away. The rest of the rookies at the table looked at me, but I ignored them. Once Roderick was out of earshot, I whispered to Benjamin and Aiden, “Guess I’m his favorite.”\n\nBenjamin snorted. “He probably wants you on cleaning duty.”\n\n“You don’t think an event like this is already covered by the Assembly?” I retorted. “No way. This’ll be something interesting.”\n\nThe background chatter of the room suddenly died. I looked towards the dais to see a bald, round man, dressed in an ocean-blue suit and white shirt, standing alone at its center. It was difficult to make out the pin on his jacket lapel, but I already knew what it was—a metallic square with three squiggly horizontal lines etched on its surface. The symbol of Humanity, of Polygon, of our leadership class.\n\nWe’d had the honor of meeting this man on our last day of training, when we were officially inaugurated into the Military. Clovis, the First Assemblyman, second in political authority only to the Ruler himself.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen!” Clovis said cheerfully into a small microphone that ran from his ear down to his mouth. “I thank you all for attending this most historic event. For thousands of years, we have lived our lives in Polygon as an isolated people. And we’ve been good at it. Our art flourishes.” He gestured at the right-hand wall, on which hung a large painting of hooded Philosophers buried in books. “Our men and women of Commerce ensure that our people’s needs are satisfied. Our Industry folk keep Polygon running without fail. And, of course, our Military keeps the peace, both within our walls and without them.”\n\n“He’s buttering up the crowd,” I muttered to my friends. “He knows working with Wolves is a tough sell.”\n\nAiden put a finger to her lips.\n\nBenjamin was right. I didn’t know how she made the cut.\n\n“But there is more to the world than Polygon. Many of you may not know this, but the Wolves have engineered some of the most astonishing creations I have ever seen. I’ve been there myself. Their world is one of gears and chemicals and things as magical as Godlets themselves. And while I’m proud of what Humankind has achieved, we can benefit from those on the other side of the continent.\n\n“The last trade with Wolves that the Assembly approved of was over thirty years ago. Many in this room will not have remembered it, and not only because there are so many young faces in attendance. It hardly lasted more than a week. Complications…arose.” The First Assemblyman clasped his hands together and smiled devilishly, as if he were about to land a punchline. “But failures of the past do not compel us to relinquish possibilities of the future. With *The Principles of Earth and Blood*, we are boundless.”\n\nHe paused, and everyone clapped to fill the brief silence.\n\n“Now, please welcome our guest of honor as he joins me. Bogg is a renowned mogul at the Builder’s Mountains. He has brought his daughter, Kara, along with him. A round of applause, please!”\n\nWhile we obliged his request, two figures entered the dais from behind its back curtain and stood by Clovis. Both wore elegant white outfits that I nearly mistook for bathrobes, but the fabric was far finer than anything I’d wear on a lazy morning, and their clothes shone as brightly as snow under the sun. Odder than their stylistic choice was that the clothing was literally *moving*—their tops gently rippled from left to right, as if dozens of tiny ocean waves were rolling underneath in rapid, successive, rhythmic fashion.\n\nBoth of them wore jewelry from head to toe, each ornament cut from a different gem. Their dangling, blood-red earrings and their sparkling, gray bracelets rotated in perfect harmony with the mechanical dance of their robes. More than half of their fingers were decorated with gemstone rings. Those, at least, stood still.\n\nTheir faces…my hand instinctively went to my hammer as I took them in, man and girl. Both were utterly covered in what looked like billions of thin whiskers. It was almost disgusting to look at. The larger man’s hair was mostly dark gray with a few dashes of white interspersed from his dome to his mane. The girl’s hair was similar in character, but it was the yellow-green of spring leaves.\n\n*She-Wolves have beards. Noted.*\n\nTheir fangs extended down what I guessed was past their chins, but they were too hairy—or too whiskery—to tell. While the man-Wolf was definitely lean for his size, the girl was definitely too skinny to be healthy. Even with all of that hair, I could see her sunken cheeks.\n\nAs our applause died down, the taller of the pair offered a deep, long bow. “Hello to you all,” he boomed in a deep, confident voice. “My daughter and I thank you for your hospitality. I’ve already met some of you when we landed earlier today. My name is Bogg, and this is Kara.”\n\nThe girl waved to the crowd with both hands, as if trying to make a joke. She stumbled forward, and for a second, I thought she’d trip over her feet.\n\nBogg’s gaze never left us, and he continued unabated. “My team and I have been in communication with Clovis and his cohort for years, ironing out the details of this deal. The Great Builder has granted all of us most fortuitous circumstances. You see, I have learned that underneath Polygon may rest undiscovered veins of metals and other valuable materials. If I understand correctly, you all use much of this metal for what you call ‘money’. But we don’t have this ‘money’ in the Builder’s Mountains. We employ the Great Builder’s seeds towards far more creative ends. With his gifts, we fertilize the world.”\n\nI frowned. *Was that a dig at us?*\n\nI noticed other faces turn sour, too.\n\nBut Bogg either didn’t notice, or he didn’t care. “We have had toys that sniff out the earth’s riches long before I came into contact with your people. We call them ‘metal detectors’. With knowledge of how Polygon runs, my team created a specialized device just for you, your own artificial bug. But I digress. I won’t bore you with details here, nor with a demonstration. Roderick and the rest of your Assembly have already seen its efficacy.\n\n“Your men of Industry will receive shipments of my toys. It has been agreed upon that I will receive some modest fraction of any metals that my bugs discover for you.” Bogg paused. “This is—”\n\nKara took a wobbly step forward, and an explosion of bile and chunks of who-knows-what rocketed from her mouth.\n\nBenjamin yelled profanity, but it was drowned out by the hundred other yells of shock. I looked wide-eyed towards my friends. “She’s drunk,” I muttered. “Guess booze hits Wolves the same way it hits us.”\n\n“Okay, okay!” Clovis shouted, as Bogg grabbed his daughter by the arm and quickly fell back behind the curtain from which they came. “I’m terribly sorry, friends. Kara must be unwell. In any case, I thank you all for attending once again. Have a good night, everyone.”\n\nPeople immediately began shuffling out of the hall. I saw staff who had been silently standing against the walls begin to clean up the place, including the vomit on the dais.\n\n“That was weird,” Aiden said as the three of us rose to our feet.\n\n“Yep,” Benjamin muttered. “This guy’s supposed to be our friend, or something? He brought his drunk daughter to his welcome ceremony. He’s spitting in our faces.”\n\n“No,” Aiden responded. “I mean, I’ve read about the Wolves. They normally raise their children communally. It’s odd that Bogg has a daughter of his own at all.”\n\n“Guess your books don’t have all the answers, after all,” Benjamin teased.\n\n“I *did* know that Wolves don’t have a currency,” Aiden protested.\n\nI put my fist out. “Much as I’d love to stick around, I’m gonna find Lieutenant Roderick. I’ll see you back at the hotel.”\n\nMy friends took turns bumping my fist, and I headed towards the table I had seen Roderick sitting at. When I turned his way, I saw that everyone at his table had already left, except him.\n\nHe was waiting for me.\n\n“Uh, sir,” I said as I approached his backside. “You wanted to see me?”\n\nRoderick turned his head but remained seated and utterly still. “Sit for a second, Wyatt.”\n\nI did, and I turned my chair so that we were face-to-face. “What can I do for you?”\n\nThe Lieutenant’s dimples showed as he held back a grin. “Some ceremony, eh?”\n\n“Seems like the Assembly will approve the deal.”\n\nRoderick laughed. “Relax, Wyatt. It’s just you and me here.” Now his face did break out in a flashy smile. “What do you really think?”\n\n“I, um…” I broke eye contact with my commander. “Sorry, I don’t know what to say, sir.”\n\n“Hey, kid, listen to me. Look at me. You’re, what, nineteen-years-old? You’ve been in the Military for less than a year. I’ve seen you in training. In action. You’ve got more drive than most rookies I’ve come across.”\n\nI looked back at Roderick and did my best to suppress the elation that wanted to leap out of my throat. “Really?”\n\nRoderick winked at me and nodded. “Between you and me. You’re passionate about your job. How long have you wanted to join the Military?”\n\n“I never considered another profession, sir.”\n\n“Figured as much. You could go a long way, kid. I see it. And I’m in your camp. Know that.”\n\n“I appreciate that. I…don’t know what to say.”\n\nHis playful expression again broke out in a chuckle. “You said that already. Now, I ask again: what did you think of that ceremony?”\n\n“Well…I don’t understand why Bogg would bring his daughter out if she’s such a liability.”\n\nRoderick nodded. “Go on.”\n\n“I don’t know what’s going on with—what was her name, Kara? If Bogg wanted to earn our trust or respect, why would he have brought his drunk daughter onto the dais? Unless his judgment is that poor, in which case we shouldn’t be trading with him in the first place. Or maybe he did it on purpose, to spit in our face. It’s dicey enough working with any Wolf, let alone a stupid or malevolent one.”\n\n“Why is that?”\n\nMy nerves had faded away, and I leaned closer towards my Lieutenant. “Humans should stick to our own. Things are good enough at Polygon. Clovis said it himself. Why entangle ourselves with another race?” I shook my head. “They’re not worth it.”\n\n“There it is,” Roderick said approvingly. “I might agree with you, kid. But you know, maybe Bogg’s technology will land us gold. More money is never a bad thing. I don’t know, honestly. I hadn’t heard about the details until his speech.”\n\n“He was mocking us,” I snapped. “He called his own technology ‘toys’ several times. Like we’re just receiving the bottom of the barrel.

I don’t like working with them, either.” He shrugged his shoulders. “But you’re wrong about one thing, Wyatt. Things can \\*always \\*get better.”\n\n“Yeah well,” I muttered. “I guess we’ll see.”\n\n“And speaking of his ‘drunk daughter’, as you called her.

I didn’t know how she made the cut.\n\n“But there is more to the world than Polygon. Many of you may not know this, but the Wolves have engineered some of the most astonishing creations I have ever seen. I’ve been there myself. Their world is one of gears and chemicals and things as magical as Godlets themselves. And while I’m proud of what Humankind has achieved, we can benefit from those on the other side of the continent.\n\n“The last trade with Wolves that the Assembly approved of was over thirty years ago. Many in this room will not have remembered it, and not only because there are so many young faces in attendance. It hardly lasted more than a week. Complications…arose.” The First Assemblyman clasped his hands together and smiled devilishly, as if he were about to land a punchline. “But failures of the past do not compel us to relinquish possibilities of the future. With *The Principles of Earth and Blood*, we are boundless.”\n\nHe paused, and everyone clapped to fill the brief silence.\n\n“Now, please welcome our guest of honor as he joins me. Bogg is a renowned mogul at the Builder’s Mountains. He has brought his daughter, Kara, along with him. A round of applause, please!”\n\nWhile we obliged his request, two figures entered the dais from behind its back curtain and stood by Clovis. Both wore elegant white outfits that I nearly mistook for bathrobes, but the fabric was far finer than anything I’d wear on a lazy morning, and their clothes shone as brightly as snow under the sun. Odder than their stylistic choice was that the clothing was literally *moving*—their tops gently rippled from left to right, as if dozens of tiny ocean waves were rolling underneath in rapid, successive, rhythmic fashion.\n\nBoth of them wore jewelry from head to toe, each ornament cut from a different gem. Their dangling, blood-red earrings and their sparkling, gray bracelets rotated in perfect harmony with the mechanical dance of their robes. More than half of their fingers were decorated with gemstone rings. Those, at least, stood still.\n\nTheir faces…my hand instinctively went to my hammer as I took them in, man and girl. Both were utterly covered in what looked like billions of thin whiskers. It was almost disgusting to look at. The larger man’s hair was mostly dark gray with a few dashes of white interspersed from his dome to his mane. The girl’s hair was similar in character, but it was the yellow-green of spring leaves.\n\n*She-Wolves have beards. Noted.*\n\nTheir fangs extended down what I guessed was past their chins, but they were too hairy—or too whiskery—to tell. While the man-Wolf was definitely lean for his size, the girl was definitely too skinny to be healthy. Even with all of that hair, I could see her sunken cheeks.\n\nAs our applause died down, the taller of the pair offered a deep, long bow. “Hello to you all,” he boomed in a deep, confident voice. “My daughter and I thank you for your hospitality. I’ve already met some of you when we landed earlier today. My name is Bogg, and this is Kara.”\n\nThe girl waved to the crowd with both hands, as if trying to make a joke. She stumbled forward, and for a second, I thought she’d trip over her feet.\n\nBogg’s gaze never left us, and he continued unabated. “My team and I have been in communication with Clovis and his cohort for years, ironing out the details of this deal. The Great Builder has granted all of us most fortuitous circumstances. You see, I have learned that underneath Polygon may rest undiscovered veins of metals and other valuable materials. If I understand correctly, you all use much of this metal for what you call ‘money’. But we don’t have this ‘money’ in the Builder’s Mountains. We employ the Great Builder’s seeds towards far more creative ends. With his gifts, we fertilize the world.”\n\nI frowned. *Was that a dig at us?*\n\nI noticed other faces turn sour, too.\n\nBut Bogg either didn’t notice, or he didn’t care. “We have had toys that sniff out the earth’s riches long before I came into contact with your people. We call them ‘metal detectors’. With knowledge of how Polygon runs, my team created a specialized device just for you, your own artificial bug. But I digress. I won’t bore you with details here, nor with a demonstration. Roderick and the rest of your Assembly have already seen its efficacy.\n\n“Your men of Industry will receive shipments of my toys. It has been agreed upon that I will receive some modest fraction of any metals that my bugs discover for you.” Bogg paused. “This is—”\n\nKara took a wobbly step forward, and an explosion of bile and chunks of who-knows-what rocketed from her mouth.\n\nBenjamin yelled profanity, but it was drowned out by the hundred other yells of shock. I looked wide-eyed towards my friends. “She’s drunk,” I muttered. “Guess booze hits Wolves the same way it hits us.”\n\n“Okay, okay!” Clovis shouted, as Bogg grabbed his daughter by the arm and quickly fell back behind the curtain from which they came. “I’m terribly sorry, friends. Kara must be unwell. In any case, I thank you all for attending once again. Have a good night, everyone.”\n\nPeople immediately began shuffling out of the hall. I saw staff who had been silently standing against the walls begin to clean up the place, including the vomit on the dais.\n\n“That was weird,” Aiden said as the three of us rose to our feet.\n\n“Yep,” Benjamin muttered. “This guy’s supposed to be our friend, or something? He brought his drunk daughter to his welcome ceremony. He’s spitting in our faces.”\n\n“No,” Aiden responded. “I mean, I’ve read about the Wolves. They normally raise their children communally. It’s odd that Bogg has a daughter of his own at all.”\n\n“Guess your books don’t have all the answers, after all,” Benjamin teased.\n\n“I *did* know that Wolves don’t have a currency,” Aiden protested.\n\nI put my fist out. “Much as I’d love to stick around, I’m gonna find Lieutenant Roderick. I’ll see you back at the hotel.”\n\nMy friends took turns bumping my fist, and I headed towards the table I had seen Roderick sitting at. When I turned his way, I saw that everyone at his table had already left, except him.\n\nHe was waiting for me.\n\n“Uh, sir,” I said as I approached his backside. “You wanted to see me?”\n\nRoderick turned his head but remained seated and utterly still. “Sit for a second, Wyatt.”\n\nI did, and I turned my chair so that we were face-to-face. “What can I do for you?”\n\nThe Lieutenant’s dimples showed as he held back a grin. “Some ceremony, eh?”\n\n“Seems like the Assembly will approve the deal.”\n\nRoderick laughed. “Relax, Wyatt. It’s just you and me here.” Now his face did break out in a flashy smile. “What do you really think?”\n\n“I, um…” I broke eye contact with my commander. “Sorry, I don’t know what to say, sir.”\n\n“Hey, kid, listen to me. Look at me. You’re, what, nineteen-years-old? You’ve been in the Military for less than a year. I’ve seen you in training. In action. You’ve got more drive than most rookies I’ve come across.”\n\nI looked back at Roderick and did my best to suppress the elation that wanted to leap out of my throat. “Really?”\n\nRoderick winked at me and nodded. “Between you and me. You’re passionate about your job. How long have you wanted to join the Military?”\n\n“I never considered another profession, sir.”\n\n“Figured as much. You could go a long way, kid. I see it. And I’m in your camp. Know that.”\n\n“I appreciate that. I…don’t know what to say.”\n\nHis playful expression again broke out in a chuckle. “You said that already. Now, I ask again: what did you think of that ceremony?”\n\n“Well…I don’t understand why Bogg would bring his daughter out if she’s such a liability.”\n\nRoderick nodded. “Go on.”\n\n“I don’t know what’s going on with—what was her name, Kara? If Bogg wanted to earn our trust or respect, why would he have brought his drunk daughter onto the dais? Unless his judgment is that poor, in which case we shouldn’t be trading with him in the first place. Or maybe he did it on purpose, to spit in our face. It’s dicey enough working with any Wolf, let alone a stupid or malevolent one.”\n\n“Why is that?”\n\nMy nerves had faded away, and I leaned closer towards my Lieutenant. “Humans should stick to our own. Things are good enough at Polygon. Clovis said it himself. Why entangle ourselves with another race?” I shook my head. “They’re not worth it.”\n\n“There it is,” Roderick said approvingly. “I might agree with you, kid. But you know, maybe Bogg’s technology will land us gold. More money is never a bad thing. I don’t know, honestly. I hadn’t heard about the details until his speech.”\n\n“He was mocking us,” I snapped. “He called his own technology ‘toys’ several times. Like we’re just receiving the bottom of the barrel. Screw him and his drunk daughter.”\n\n“Okay, okay!” Roderick held his hands up teasingly. “I hear you. I don’t like working with them, either.” He shrugged his shoulders. “But you’re wrong about one thing, Wyatt. Things can \\*always \\*get better.”\n\n“Yeah well,” I muttered. “I guess we’ll see.”\n\n“And speaking of his ‘drunk daughter’, as you called her. That’s why I wanted to talk to you.”\n\nI sat back in my chair. “Oh?”\n\nRoderick cocked his head and looked vaguely puzzled. “You were in attendance when their ship landed earlier today. I know the two of them exited very quickly and were escorted away, but did you by any chance make eye contact with Kara?”\n\nI pursed my lips. “Not at all. To be totally honest, I barely looked at them.”\n\n“Not curious to see what a Wolf looked like? I know you hadn’t seen one yet, out in the Wildlands.”\n\n“Nope. Not at all. They’re not us.”\n\nRoderick snorted. “Fair enough. And you’ve been in my sights for the last few hours. You couldn’t have interacted with her since then.”\n\n“Sir, what’s this about?”\n\n“She wants a night out on the town. Apparently she wants to check out the Capital’s bar scene. From what I’m told, she requested you as her tour guide.”\n\nI frowned. “What? That’s my task?”\n\nRoderick nodded. “Yeah. Not the sexiest order I’ll give you, but there it is. They’re our guests, so it’s not really our call.”\n\n“No, I get that. Bogg’s going to let her out after that debacle? How old is she, anyway?”\n\n“I don’t know. Couple years younger than you, I guess, though the beard makes it hard to tell.”\n\nI ran a hand through my hair, unsure how to react. “I…don’t like this. I don’t want to talk to these Wolves. I definitely don’t want to babysit some drunk.”\n\n“I get it. Think of it as security service. I don’t know how these Wolves choose to live, and I certainly wouldn’t let my kid out after humiliating me. Who knows, maybe that’s going to be the case. Before the ceremony, my superior had told Bogg that you’d meet her outside her hotel at nine p.m. Maybe she won’t show. But if she does, you’re there to protect her.”\n\nI grinned at my Lieutenant. “I do like that better than babysitting.”\n\nHe lightly punched me in the arm. “There you go. Oh, and don’t change your clothes. Let’s keep a professional face.”\n\n“Definitely.”\n\n“Do you know where \\*No Rules \\*is? It’s a high-end bar just a few blocks from where Kara and Bogg are staying.”\n\nI nodded. “Yeah. I’ve never gone in, though. Last time I was in the Capital was when we passed our training. My friends and I celebrated in the area.”\n\n“I’m sure you did. Here.”\n\nRoderick pulled out something from his jacket pocket and handed me half a dozen heavy golden coins. I looked at them and saw the same insignia inscribed on them that was on Clovis’ pin. I whistled. “This isn’t your money, is it?”\n\n“Of course not. I like you, but not that much. The Assembly’s covering whatever Kara wants tonight.”\n\n“I won’t drink,” I assured him.\n\nHe smiled proudly at me. “I know you won’t. Look, I know it won’t be the most fun job, but I’ll make sure people know you did it well.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. Do you know why she chose me?”\n\nRoderick rose to his feet, and I followed suit. He extended a rough, calloused hand to me. I met his grip. “You have an hour to yourself before you’re on duty. I have no idea why she insisted on you, but you can ask her. Might be a good way to bypass small talk, anyway. Good luck, Wyatt. I’ll see you in the morning.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. For everything. I won’t let you down.”\n\nWith one last charming grin, my commander walked away and left the banquet hall.\n\nI looked around and realized that no one was left but the cleaning crew and me. I closed my eyes and took a breath.\n\n*One night. One Wolf. One job.*\n\n*I got this.*\n\n[crowdfund://0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC?features=](crowdfund://0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC?features=)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633463118, "digest": "mf05WJGltTepfpIMGG2tGQoF7VkhF5wq1rlpZfaI_4Y", "contributor": "0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC"}
{"id": "JNaWXbx310deW9EJiAVLtZJRuMMMMxhbqhkpXw5BmNU", "title": "Windfall: Chapter One", "body": "Chapter One\n\n*Six days earlier…*\n\n“You gonna eat that?”\n\nI looked up at Benjamin, who was staring eagerly at the untouched turkey leg on my plate. “Go for it, champ.”\n\nHe grabbed it with his bare hands and gnawed on the leg like a starved vulture. “God, that’s disgusting,” I muttered.\n\n“You really should slow down and learn some etiquette,” Aiden said, who was sitting to Benjamin’s right. “We’re lucky to be at such a formal occasion.”\n\nBenjamin tried speaking with his mouth full, but I interrupted. “Don’t, dude. You start spitting across the table, and they’ll definitely kick us out.”\n\nThe brute rolled his eyes but obliged. I shared a look with Aiden, and we shook our heads in unison.\n\nThe three of us sat at a roundtable by the hall’s back wall, having chosen one of the dozen or so that had been assigned to Soldiers. Some other rookies sat alongside us, but I think Benjamin’s savagery kept them from chatting us up.\n\nI scanned the room and guessed that there were around two-hundred people enjoying the buffet. Military members were easy to pick out, since they wore star-shaped pins on their otherwise formal attire. We were told not to wear our combat gear for the banquet, but that we were encouraged to bring a weapon or two.\n\nMy naked sledgehammer dangled from my belt.\n\n“I recognize some of the Philosophers here,” Aiden said. She nodded towards a table several rows closer to the room’s dais than we were. “See them? They write about the nature of laws.”\n\nI looked over at Aiden. She was pale, skinny, and her white-blonde hair somehow reminded me of dying grass. “Why would they be invited to this?”\n\nAiden smiled, her green eyes darting excitedly. “The Wolves make things that Humans could never dream to. I’m sure they’re interested.”\n\nI shrugged my shoulders so that my jacket fell back into place. It was a little big for me, but Mom tried her best. I hated dressing like this. If I wanted to dress up for work, I would’ve joined the ranks of Commerce. “Yeah, well, all that thinking won’t help if the Wolves decide the buffet isn’t cutting it.”\n\nBenjamin let loose a thunderous burp, which earned looks of horror by the other rookies at the table. “I’m with Wyatt. You can’t trust an animal.”\n\n“Didn’t some horde of Wolves try to raid Polygon just last week?” I added.\n\n“Yeah,” Aiden said diffidently, “but those were from the Wildlands. This is different.”\n\n“Uh-huh,” Benjamin muttered. “Don’t see any Humans living in the Wildlands.” He tapped Aiden’s nose. “Don’t be naïve, sweetie. It’ll get you killed.”\n\nAiden grabbed Benjamin’s finger and tossed it away. “Not all problems can be solved with a gun. Read a book, ogre.”\n\n“Books didn’t help me last month against those rhinos,” Benjamin retorted. “Wyatt was there, he’ll tell you. Wyatt?”\n\nI’d only been half-listening to my friends’ banter. My eyes were locked with a man walking towards our table. “What? Sure. Hey, I think Lieutenant Roderick is headed our way.”\n\nEveryone at the table straightened up at that, including me. I had more reason than the others—Roderick was \\*my \\*Lieutenant, my direct commander.\n\n“Hey,” he said when he reached me.\n\nI kept eye contact and prayed that I didn’t have food on the sides of my mouth. “Sir.”\n\n“Come find me after the ceremony. I have a job for you.”\n\nI suppressed the excitement and curiosity that threatened to leak through my face. “Yessir.”\n\nWith a nod, the strong-jawed Lieutenant walked away. The rest of the rookies at the table looked at me, but I ignored them. Once Roderick was out of earshot, I whispered to Benjamin and Aiden, “Guess I’m his favorite.”\n\nBenjamin snorted. “He probably wants you on cleaning duty.”\n\n“You don’t think an event like this is already covered by the Assembly?” I retorted. “No way. This’ll be something interesting.”\n\nThe background chatter of the room suddenly died. I looked towards the dais to see a bald, round man, dressed in an ocean-blue suit and white shirt, standing alone at its center. It was difficult to make out the pin on his jacket lapel, but I already knew what it was—a metallic square with three squiggly horizontal lines etched on its surface. The symbol of Humanity, of Polygon, of our leadership class.\n\nWe’d had the honor of meeting this man on our last day of training, when we were officially inaugurated into the Military. Clovis, the First Assemblyman, second in political authority only to the Ruler himself.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen!” Clovis said cheerfully into a small microphone that ran from his ear down to his mouth. “I thank you all for attending this most historic event. For thousands of years, we have lived our lives in Polygon as an isolated people. And we’ve been good at it. Our art flourishes.” He gestured at the right-hand wall, on which hung a large painting of hooded Philosophers buried in books. “Our men and women of Commerce ensure that our people’s needs are satisfied. Our Industry folk keep Polygon running without fail. And, of course, our Military keeps the peace, both within our walls and without them.”\n\n“He’s buttering up the crowd,” I muttered to my friends. “He knows working with Wolves is a tough sell.”\n\nAiden put a finger to her lips.\n\nBenjamin was right. I didn’t know how she made the cut.\n\n“But there is more to the world than Polygon. Many of you may not know this, but the Wolves have engineered some of the most astonishing creations I have ever seen. I’ve been there myself. Their world is one of gears and chemicals and things as magical as Godlets themselves. And while I’m proud of what Humankind has achieved, we can benefit from those on the other side of the continent.\n\n“The last trade with Wolves that the Assembly approved of was over thirty years ago.

With *The Principles of Earth and Blood*, we are boundless.”\n\nHe paused, and everyone clapped to fill the brief silence.\n\n“Now, please welcome our guest of honor as he joins me. Bogg is a renowned mogul at the Builder’s Mountains. He has brought his daughter, Kara, along with him. A round of applause, please!”\n\nWhile we obliged his request, two figures entered the dais from behind its back curtain and stood by Clovis. Both wore elegant white outfits that I nearly mistook for bathrobes, but the fabric was far finer than anything I’d wear on a lazy morning, and their clothes shone as brightly as snow under the sun. Odder than their stylistic choice was that the clothing was literally *moving*—their tops gently rippled from left to right, as if dozens of tiny ocean waves were rolling underneath in rapid, successive, rhythmic fashion.\n\nBoth of them wore jewelry from head to toe, each ornament cut from a different gem.

Oh, and don’t change your clothes. Let’s keep a professional face.”\n\n“Definitely.”\n\n“Do you know where \\*No Rules \\*is? It’s a high-end bar just a few blocks from where Kara and Bogg are staying.”\n\nI nodded. “Yeah. I’ve never gone in, though. Last time I was in the Capital was when we passed our training. My friends and I celebrated in the area.”\n\n“I’m sure you did. Here.”\n\nRoderick pulled out something from his jacket pocket and handed me half a dozen heavy golden coins. I looked at them and saw the same insignia inscribed on them that was on Clovis’ pin. I whistled. “This isn’t your money, is it?”\n\n“Of course not. I like you, but not that much. The Assembly’s covering whatever Kara wants tonight.”\n\n“I won’t drink,” I assured him.\n\nHe smiled proudly at me. “I know you won’t. Look, I know it won’t be the most fun job, but I’ll make sure people know you did it well.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. Do you know why she chose me?”\n\nRoderick rose to his feet, and I followed suit. He extended a rough, calloused hand to me. I met his grip. “You have an hour to yourself before you’re on duty. I have no idea why she insisted on you, but you can ask her. Might be a good way to bypass small talk, anyway. Good luck, Wyatt. I’ll see you in the morning.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. For everything. I won’t let you down.”\n\nWith one last charming grin, my commander walked away and left the banquet hall.\n\nI looked around and realized that no one was left but the cleaning crew and me. I closed my eyes and took a breath.\n\n*One night. One Wolf. One job.*\n\n*I got this.*\n\n[crowdfund://0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC?features=](crowdfund://0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC?features=)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633462958, "digest": "LgPXnmcAKHlacfRdFP_2--YT5-cgMSQzhPz-GZnKCrw", "contributor": "0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC"}

{"id": "8bh4-arqe5fY4cwZvEqmRiLlknUlYPjk-MOBF_U0uFw", "title": "Windfall: Chapter One", "body": "Chapter One\n\n*Six days earlier…*\n\n“You gonna eat that?”\n\nI looked up at Benjamin, who was staring eagerly at the untouched turkey leg on my plate. “Go for it, champ.”\n\nHe grabbed it with his bare hands and gnawed on the leg like a starved vulture. “God, that’s disgusting,” I muttered.\n\n“You really should slow down and learn some etiquette,” Aiden said, who was sitting to Benjamin’s right. “We’re lucky to be at such a formal occasion.”\n\nBenjamin tried speaking with his mouth full, but I interrupted. “Don’t, dude. You start spitting across the table, and they’ll definitely kick us out.”\n\nThe brute rolled his eyes but obliged. I shared a look with Aiden, and we shook our heads in unison.\n\nThe three of us sat at a roundtable by the hall’s back wall, having chosen one of the dozen or so that had been assigned to Soldiers. Some other rookies sat alongside us, but I think Benjamin’s savagery kept them from chatting us up.\n\nI scanned the room and guessed that there were around two-hundred people enjoying the buffet. Military members were easy to pick out, since they wore star-shaped pins on their otherwise formal attire. We were told not to wear our combat gear for the banquet, but that we were encouraged to bring a weapon or two.\n\nMy naked sledgehammer dangled from my belt.\n\n“I recognize some of the Philosophers here,” Aiden said. She nodded towards a table several rows closer to the room’s dais than we were. “See them? They write about the nature of laws.”\n\nI looked over at Aiden. She was pale, skinny, and her white-blonde hair somehow reminded me of dying grass. “Why would they be invited to this?”\n\nAiden smiled, her green eyes darting excitedly. “The Wolves make things that Humans could never dream to. I’m sure they’re interested.”\n\nI shrugged my shoulders so that my jacket fell back into place. It was a little big for me, but Mom tried her best. I hated dressing like this. If I wanted to dress up for work, I would’ve joined the ranks of Commerce. “Yeah, well, all that thinking won’t help if the Wolves decide the buffet isn’t cutting it.”\n\nBenjamin let loose a thunderous burp, which earned looks of horror by the other rookies at the table. “I’m with Wyatt. You can’t trust an animal.”\n\n“Didn’t some horde of Wolves try to raid Polygon just last week?” I added.\n\n“Yeah,” Aiden said diffidently, “but those were from the Wildlands. This is different.”\n\n“Uh-huh,” Benjamin muttered. “Don’t see any Humans living in the Wildlands.” He tapped Aiden’s nose. “Don’t be naïve, sweetie. It’ll get you killed.” \n\nAiden grabbed Benjamin’s finger and tossed it away. “Not all problems can be solved with a gun. Read a book, ogre.”\n\n“Books didn’t help me last month against those rhinos,” Benjamin retorted. “Wyatt was there, he’ll tell you. Wyatt?”\n\nI’d only been half-listening to my friends’ banter. My eyes were locked with a man walking towards our table. “What? Sure. Hey, I think Lieutenant Roderick is headed our way.”\n\nEveryone at the table straightened up at that, including me. I had more reason than the others—Roderick was *my *Lieutenant, my direct commander.\n\n“Hey,” he said when he reached me.\n\nI kept eye contact and prayed that I didn’t have food on the sides of my mouth. “Sir.”\n\n“Come find me after the ceremony. I have a job for you.”\n\nI suppressed the excitement and curiosity that threatened to leak through my face. “Yessir.”\n\nWith a nod, the strong-jawed Lieutenant walked away. The rest of the rookies at the table looked at me, but I ignored them. Once Roderick was out of earshot, I whispered to Benjamin and Aiden, “Guess I’m his favorite.”\n\nBenjamin snorted. “He probably wants you on cleaning duty.”\n\n“You don’t think an event like this is already covered by the Assembly?” I retorted. “No way. This’ll be something interesting.”\n\nThe background chatter of the room suddenly died. I looked towards the dais to see a bald, round man, dressed in an ocean-blue suit and white shirt, standing alone at its center. It was difficult to make out the pin on his jacket lapel, but I already knew what it was—a metallic square with three squiggly horizontal lines etched on its surface. The symbol of Humanity, of Polygon, of our leadership class.\n\nWe’d had the honor of meeting this man on our last day of training, when we were officially inaugurated into the Military. Clovis, the First Assemblyman, second in political authority only to the Ruler himself.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen!” Clovis said cheerfully into a small microphone that ran from his ear down to his mouth. “I thank you all for attending this most historic event. For thousands of years, we have lived our lives in Polygon as an isolated people. And we’ve been good at it. Our art flourishes.” He gestured at the right-hand wall, on which hung a large painting of hooded Philosophers buried in books. “Our men and women of Commerce ensure that our people’s needs are satisfied. Our Industry folk keep Polygon running without fail. And, of course, our Military keeps the peace, both within our walls and without them.”\n\n“He’s buttering up the crowd,” I muttered to my friends. “He knows working with Wolves is a tough sell.”\n\nAiden put a finger to her lips.\n\nBenjamin was right. I didn’t know how she made the cut.\n\n“But there is more to the world than Polygon. Many of you may not know this, but the Wolves have engineered some of the most astonishing creations I have ever seen. I’ve been there myself. Their world is one of gears and chemicals and things as magical as Godlets themselves. And while I’m proud of what Humankind has achieved, we can benefit from those on the other side of the continent.\n\n“The last trade with Wolves that the Assembly approved of was over thirty years ago. Many in this room will not have remembered it, and not only because there are so many young faces in attendance. It hardly lasted more than a week. Complications…arose.” The First Assemblyman clasped his hands together and smiled devilishly, as if he were about to land a punchline. “But failures of the past do not compel us to relinquish possibilities of the future. With *The Principles of Earth and Blood*, we are boundless.”\n\nHe paused, and everyone clapped to fill the brief silence.\n\n“Now, please welcome our guest of honor as he joins me. Bogg is a renowned mogul at the Builder’s Mountains. He has brought his daughter, Kara, along with him. A round of applause, please!”\n\nWhile we obliged his request, two figures entered the dais from behind its back curtain and stood by Clovis. Both wore elegant white outfits that I nearly mistook for bathrobes, but the fabric was far finer than anything I’d wear on a lazy morning, and their clothes shone as brightly as snow under the sun. Odder than their stylistic choice was that the clothing was literally *moving*—their tops gently rippled from left to right, as if dozens of tiny ocean waves were rolling underneath in rapid, successive, rhythmic fashion.\n\nBoth of them wore jewelry from head to toe, each ornament cut from a different gem. Their dangling, blood-red earrings and their sparkling, gray bracelets rotated in perfect harmony with the mechanical dance of their robes. More than half of their fingers were decorated with gemstone rings. Those, at least, stood still.\n\nTheir faces…my hand instinctively went to my hammer as I took them in, man and girl. Both were utterly covered in what looked like billions of thin whiskers. It was almost disgusting to look at. The larger man’s hair was mostly dark gray with a few dashes of white interspersed from his dome to his mane. The girl’s hair was similar in character, but it was the yellow-green of spring leaves.\n\n*She-Wolves have beards. Noted.*\n\nTheir fangs extended down what I guessed was past their chins, but they were too hairy—or too whiskery—to tell. While the man-Wolf was definitely lean for his size, the girl was definitely too skinny to be healthy. Even with all of that hair, I could see her sunken cheeks.\n\nAs our applause died down, the taller of the pair offered a deep, long bow. “Hello to you all,” he boomed in a deep, confident voice. “My daughter and I thank you for your hospitality. I’ve already met some of you when we landed earlier today. My name is Bogg, and this is Kara.”\n\nThe girl waved to the crowd with both hands, as if trying to make a joke. She stumbled forward, and for a second, I thought she’d trip over her feet.\n\nBogg’s gaze never left us, and he continued unabated. “My team and I have been in communication with Clovis and his cohort for years, ironing out the details of this deal. The Great Builder has granted all of us most fortuitous circumstances. You see, I have learned that underneath Polygon may rest undiscovered veins of metals and other valuable materials. If I understand correctly, you all use much of this metal for what you call ‘money’. But we don’t have this ‘money’ in the Builder’s Mountains. We employ the Great Builder’s seeds towards far more creative ends. With his gifts, we fertilize the world.”\n\nI frowned. *Was that a dig at us?*\n\nI noticed other faces turn sour, too.\n\nBut Bogg either didn’t notice, or he didn’t care. “We have had toys that sniff out the earth’s riches long before I came into contact with your people. We call them ‘metal detectors’. With knowledge of how Polygon runs, my team created a specialized device just for you, your own artificial bug. But I digress. I won’t bore you with details here, nor with a demonstration. Roderick and the rest of your Assembly have already seen its efficacy.\n\n“Your men of Industry will receive shipments of my toys. It has been agreed upon that I will receive some modest fraction of any metals that my bugs discover for you.” Bogg paused. “This is—”\n\nKara took a wobbly step forward, and an explosion of bile and chunks of who-knows-what rocketed from her mouth.\n\nBenjamin yelled profanity, but it was drowned out by the hundred other yells of shock. I looked wide-eyed towards my friends. “She’s drunk,” I muttered. “Guess booze hits Wolves the same way it hits us.”\n\n“Okay, okay!” Clovis shouted, as Bogg grabbed his daughter by the arm and quickly fell back behind the curtain from which they came. “I’m terribly sorry, friends. Kara must be unwell. In any case, I thank you all for attending once again. Have a good night, everyone.”\n\nPeople immediately began shuffling out of the hall. I saw staff who had been silently standing against the walls begin to clean up the place, including the vomit on the dais.\n\n“That was weird,” Aiden said as the three of us rose to our feet.\n\n“Yep,” Benjamin muttered. “This guy’s supposed to be our friend, or something? He brought his drunk daughter to his welcome ceremony. He’s spitting in our faces.”\n\n“No,” Aiden responded. “I mean, I’ve read about the Wolves. They normally raise their children communally. It’s odd that Bogg has a daughter of his own at all.”\n\n“Guess your books don’t have all the answers, after all,” Benjamin teased.\n\n“I *did* know that Wolves don’t have a currency,” Aiden protested.\n\nI put my fist out. “Much as I’d love to stick around, I’m gonna find Lieutenant Roderick. I’ll see you back at the hotel.”\n\nMy friends took turns bumping my fist, and I headed towards the table I had seen Roderick sitting at. When I turned his way, I saw that everyone at his table had already left, except him.\n\nHe was waiting for me.\n\n“Uh, sir,” I said as I approached his backside. “You wanted to see me?”\n\nRoderick turned his head but remained seated and utterly still. “Sit for a second, Wyatt.”\n\nI did, and I turned my chair so that we were face-to-face. “What can I do for you?”\n\nThe Lieutenant’s dimples showed as he held back a grin. “Some ceremony, eh?”\n\n“Seems like the Assembly will approve the deal.”\n\nRoderick laughed. “Relax, Wyatt. It’s just you and me here.” Now his face did break out in a flashy smile. “What do you really think?”\n\n“I, um…” I broke eye contact with my commander. “Sorry, I don’t know what to say, sir.”\n\n“Hey, kid, listen to me. Look at me. You’re, what, nineteen-years-old? You’ve been in the Military for less than a year. I’ve seen you in training. In action. You’ve got more drive than most rookies I’ve come across.”\n\nI looked back at Roderick and did my best to suppress the elation that wanted to leap out of my throat. “Really?”\n\nRoderick winked at me and nodded. “Between you and me. You’re passionate about your job. How long have you wanted to join the Military?”\n\n“I never considered another profession, sir.”\n\n“Figured as much. You could go a long way, kid. I see it. And I’m in your camp. Know that.”\n\n“I appreciate that. I…don’t know what to say.”\n\nHis playful expression again broke out in a chuckle. “You said that already. Now, I ask again: what did you think of that ceremony?”\n\n“Well…I don’t understand why Bogg would bring his daughter out if she’s such a liability.”\n\nRoderick nodded. “Go on.”\n\n“I don’t know what’s going on with—what was her name, Kara? If Bogg wanted to earn our trust or respect, why would he have brought his drunk daughter onto the dais? Unless his judgment is that poor, in which case we shouldn’t be trading with him in the first place. Or maybe he did it on purpose, to spit in our face. It’s dicey enough working with any Wolf, let alone a stupid or malevolent one.”\n\n“Why is that?”\n\nMy nerves had faded away, and I leaned closer towards my Lieutenant. “Humans should stick to our own. Things are good enough at Polygon. Clovis said it himself. Why entangle ourselves with another race?” I shook my head. “They’re not worth it.”\n\n“There it is,” Roderick said approvingly. “I might agree with you, kid. But you know, maybe Bogg’s technology will land us gold. More money is never a bad thing. I don’t know, honestly. I hadn’t heard about the details until his speech.”\n\n“He was mocking us,” I snapped. “He called his own technology ‘toys’ several times. Like we’re just receiving the bottom of the barrel. Screw him and his drunk daughter.”\n\n“Okay, okay!” Roderick held his hands up teasingly. “I hear you. I don’t like working with them, either.” He shrugged his shoulders. “But you’re wrong about one thing, Wyatt. Things can *always *get better.”\n\n“Yeah well,” I muttered. “I guess we’ll see.”\n\n“And speaking of his ‘drunk daughter’, as you called her. That’s why I wanted to talk to you.”\n\nI sat back in my chair. “Oh?”\n\nRoderick cocked his head and looked vaguely puzzled. “You were in attendance when their ship landed earlier today. I know the two of them exited very quickly and were escorted away, but did you by any chance make eye contact with Kara?”\n\nI pursed my lips. “Not at all. To be totally honest, I barely looked at them.”\n\n“Not curious to see what a Wolf looked like? I know you hadn’t seen one yet, out in the Wildlands.”\n\n“Nope. Not at all. They’re not us.”\n\nRoderick snorted. “Fair enough. And you’ve been in my sights for the last few hours. You couldn’t have interacted with her since then.”\n\n“Sir, what’s this about?”\n\n“She wants a night out on the town. Apparently she wants to check out the Capital’s bar scene. From what I’m told, she requested you as her tour guide.”\n\nI frowned. “What? That’s my task?”\n\nRoderick nodded. “Yeah. Not the sexiest order I’ll give you, but there it is. They’re our guests, so it’s not really our call.”\n\n“No, I get that. Bogg’s going to let her out after that debacle? How old is she, anyway?”\n\n“I don’t know. Couple years younger than you, I guess, though the beard makes it hard to tell.”\n\nI ran a hand through my hair, unsure how to react. “I…don’t like this. I don’t want to talk to these Wolves. I definitely don’t want to babysit some drunk.”\n\n“I get it. Think of it as security service. I don’t know how these Wolves choose to live, and I certainly wouldn’t let my kid out after humiliating me. Who knows, maybe that’s going to be the case. Before the ceremony, my superior had told Bogg that you’d meet her outside her hotel at nine p.m. Maybe she won’t show. But if she does, you’re there to protect her.”\n\nI grinned at my Lieutenant. “I do like that better than babysitting.”\n\nHe lightly punched me in the arm. “There you go. Oh, and don’t change your clothes. Let’s keep a professional face.”\n\n“Definitely.”\n\n“Do you know where *No Rules *is? It’s a high-end bar just a few blocks from where Kara and Bogg are staying.”\n\nI nodded. “Yeah. I’ve never gone in, though. Last time I was in the Capital was when we passed our training. My friends and I celebrated in the area.”\n\n“I’m sure you did. Here.”\n\nRoderick pulled out something from his jacket pocket and handed me half a dozen heavy golden coins. I looked at them and saw the same insignia inscribed on them that was on Clovis’ pin. I whistled. “This isn’t your money, is it?”\n\n “Of course not. I like you, but not that much. The Assembly’s covering whatever Kara wants tonight.”\n\n“I won’t drink,” I assured him.\n\nHe smiled proudly at me. “I know you won’t. Look, I know it won’t be the most fun job, but I’ll make sure people know you did it well.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. Do you know why she chose me?”\n\nRoderick rose to his feet, and I followed suit. He extended a rough, calloused hand to me. I met his grip. “You have an hour to yourself before you’re on duty. I have no idea why she insisted on you, but you can ask her. Might be a good way to bypass small talk, anyway. Good luck, Wyatt. I’ll see you in the morning.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. For everything. I won’t let you down.”\n\nWith one last charming grin, my commander walked away and left the banquet hall.\n\nI looked around and realized that no one was left but the cleaning crew and me. I closed my eyes and took a breath.\n\n*One night. One Wolf. One job.*\n\n*I got this.*\n\n————————————————————————————————————\n\n*I thank Sam Nix, Kitt Johnson, Matt McLernon, JP Doherty, Joe Immen, Jaime Pellegrin, Julio Torres, Neil Hudson, David Perlmutter, Diana Cimino, and Ahmad Abdulla for their continued support.*\n\n*If you also enjoy Windfall and wish to support my writing, you may do so via Patreon at https\\://www\\.patreon.com/Fallibleanimals.

{"id": "8Mkr5DoO_KckS9SEISPLtmWsPGJDihJ9Of_YUkwLb-g", "title": "Chapter One: A Man Called Dove", "body": "The solver watched a tall woman hurry down the street. She had blonde hair, and she wore a black coat that billowed around a white dress. Her heels were polished black—the kind the girls wore in the darker places of Junction. Blues and pinks reflected off them and it looked like she was dancing in the rain that hadn’t stopped pouring for a week.\n\nHe sniffed. Sulphur floated in the air and masked the stink of a world gone mad, filled with people who had forgotten themselves, lost in the luxury of light and plenty. There were no more stop signs, no more forks in the road. Desire had become linear, and the path to absolution was paved neon.\n\n“She’s different.” Mai’s voice infiltrated the solver’s thoughts.\n\n“Track her,” said the solver, tapping again at the cylindrical lenses sticking forward from his head. His goggles were special to him. He’d earned them on the Arch, long ago, as a reward for being who he was—who he’d become. Solvers were honed and dangerous. They were weapons made by new men from the ashes of the old world, and he was among the oldest and most dangerous. But also the most tortured. The program had left no visible scars, but they were there, and they were as earned as his vision.\n\nWhere was the woman going? He raised a green-gloved hand to his face and adjusted a lens, spiralling it between nimble fingers, grooves of the lens rippling the soft plastic of his glove.\n\nThe image of the mid-town market shifted; the opaque became clear and the hidden became seen. The woman kept flicking her feet, faster now, purposeful. \n\n“She’s headed to Chunda House,” said Mai inside his head. His Core had found a pattern and crunched the numbers. The solver checked the girl’s direction and made some estimations of his own, then grunted. Chunda House, he wondered. Going to see the Cybs, probably.\n\nThe Cybs were a blight. They were a collection of drugged-up augments who lived only for the next hit—a metaphor for what life had become. During the Reckoning, in that split-second of confusion when Providence had impossibly gone offline—when the city became bathed in darkness and its guardians had gone blind—the Cybs had seized their chance to infect far and wide. They took territory and spread their “religion.” No doubt the girls in the black heels were already paying their dues to their new digital pimps. The tall woman was likely no different. But...\n\n“It feels wrong,” he said.\n\nMai buzzed in his mind. “Maybe it’s just your nanos messing with your head again, Dove.”\n\n“It’s not my fucking nanos.”\n\n“Easy, tiger.”\n\nDove didn’t respond. His Core was right, of course. She was always right. Every day, Dove burned. Every damned day. His creation had been a sin. In all of the Illumination’s glory, while revelling in their brilliance, they hadn’t considered an expiry date, or a shelf-life. Solvers like Dove—old, weary—needed refurbishment often. Too long in the field without care or attention, and they’d suffer silently. Sometimes loudly.\n\nThe Illumination’s agent of light who had delivered Dove’s current instructions had been certain: find Maxine. But Dove doubted a Junction hooker would be the key to finding the Passport and bringing order back to the City, still teetering on the brink of collapse in the wake of the Reckoning. It wouldn’t bring Providence back online. What did the Illumination want with Maxine, he wondered?\n\n“The girl is working with the Cybs, Dove—still think this is a waste of time?” Mai asked.\n\n“Maybe,” he said.\n\nBut he knew better than to second guess his source. Everything led somewhere; everyone wanted something. It’d been two weeks since the Reckoning, and the City had grown darker and more dangerous. Someone had wanted it that way, and Dove would find out why and who. Not for the Illumination, who had commanded his obedience, but for himself. Do this, he had thought, and perhaps he’d earn his freedom.\n\nThe uneasy pact he’d made with the Illumination had led him here, to this back alley in the dregs of the City, watching a girl with black heels scurry into a cartel hole. He followed.\n\nGetting inside wasn’t difficult, despite the gatekeeper. Cybs were small minded, their pride was misplaced, and they were sure in their superiority. Sure, they’d heard of the hack Dove now sent scurrying through the gatekeeper’s neural net, but they did not believe. Military men taking over their implants? Absurd. He flicked his eyes and a series of menus opened. He saw the conjured strings of code within, and he accessed the nanos floating about the bouncer’s brainstem. It took seconds, maybe less. The idiots were still using tech developed in the dawn of the Singularity. It was archaic—slow and clunky. Easy for a solver.\n\nThe doors to Chunda House opened to him and its taint declared itself like a crashing train. Music used to mean something. Now the streets were filled with disconnected tones and beats, waves laced with synth and vibe in sync with the always flickering halogen of the night. It was worse inside—in your face, inescapable, forcing you to recognize its power. The dancers matched the music: thugs with metal limbs and teeth, inhuman faces carved from steel, draped in the finest silk, lugging behind them girls with black heels and other creatures of the night. Everyone drank, liquids thick and thin, blue and red and yellow, each capable of making one forget, or become someone else. Even for a night.\n\n*Not sure why the Cybs bother*, he thought. Their nanos scrubbed it all up before it could take hold of their blood.\n\nThere. The tall woman sat in the corner alone, a bottle of something blue before her on a table shaped  like a flower, each pedal sharp and cold. The solver adjusted his vision, scoped Maxine’s face, and saw the red puffiness of her eyes and cheeks glistening sodium and hate. He pulled at his green glove, snapped it against his wrist, then clenched his teeth. A tick; a tell. A habit he couldn’t stop no matter how stupid it made him, or how weak. A vestige of a former life, all but forgotten. But still with him.\n\nMaxine. The Illumination kept detailed files on targets of interest—so deep that a childhood seemed just another word on a page, chapters of lives running on forever. Her full name was Maxine de L’avant, and she was a True Worlder. Not an original, of course, but descended from pre-singularity lines. Her family name made her wealthy, so why had she decided to waste away in Junction, turning tricks for the Disconnected, and now in the service of Cybs? The question had bothered him since he’d left the Arch.\n\nDrunks and gangsters swept aside before him, desperate to avoid his attention and the shuffle of his black cloak as he pointed his way across the bar to where Maxine sat. Some knew him, sure, and some didn’t; but even those blissfully ignorant sensed him. The night-girl saw him come but did not recoil, wide eyes fixed on his face. He imagined the horror she saw: a square jaw, stubble, and lids for eyes failing to hide the rage within. Maxine dangled a glass from thin fingers, tipped white. She held a pinky to her lips, also white, like her dress. Black and white, Maxine. If it were only so simple.\n\nHe slipped into her booth, rested his arms on the table and clasped his hands. No fear, just curiosity. She didn’t seem to know who he was, or what he was. In the strobing light of the bar, her face pulsed rapidly and his vision corrected to create a full image. She was young, but not too young. A crack at her lips, in her foundation, and a crease in her temple. The way the joints of her knuckles protruded a bit too much, or how she sat back, relaxed, poised. The environment coalesced around her until she was the pinpoint, she was the energy, a beacon in a white dress. What was she doing in a place like this?\n\n“I’ve been looking for you, Maxine.”\n\nShe sipped, and a trickle of blue seeped from the corners of her lips. She caught it with her pinky, licked it off, stared at him with eyeballs round and shining.\n\n“You found me, mystery man.”\n\n“The Cybs?” asked Dove.\n\n“They keep me safe,” she said.\n\n“Is it worth the price?”\n\nShe turned away, brushed her hair with a hand, and rested her elbow on the hard steel top of the booth. He saw it just then—a hesitation. Brief, but real. She was scarred, too. The kind of scars that went unseen except to those who looked.\n\n“Maybe it is. Doesn’t matter. You want a drink?”\n\n“No.” He snapped his glove.\n\n“Fine by me,” she said. Refill. The bottle was almost gone, now. That would have been too much for her alone; someone had come and gone and left her in tears—despondent. Or maybe this was her, all of her, in the flesh. Maxine de L'avant, black heels and all.\n\n“Do you have it?” he asked.\n\nShe paused mid-sip, let the cocktail roll on her tongue and gulped it down. It was enough—confirmation. The agent’s direction to Maxine had been sound, and his information was reliable. The solver’s answers started here.\n\n“I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about, stranger. What did you say your name was?”\n\n“I didn’t.”\n\nHer eyes were focused now, no longer hazy, and she sat straighter. A delicate hand wiped away the last of her dried tears. She sniffed.\n\n“No, I guess you didn’t. Doesn’t take an Elite to figure it out though, where you come from, I mean. That cloak, those eyes, if you can call them that. You’re a solver, aren’t you?”\n\nSo, he thought. She did know what he was.\n\n“Shit,” she continued. “Never thought I’d meet one. Didn’t think they—you—were a real thing, you know? One of those legends that runs through the circuits, a myth of our cybernetic reality, an echo of light and electricity. Who can tell any more what’s real and what’s not. Do you remember? Before, I mean? Life pre-singularity. You should have seen it, solver, it was so beautiful. Green, everywhere—green like your gloves. Fresh air. Quiet. I remember.”\n\n“You’d have been a child, at best,” he said.\n\n“I said I remember, ok?” Curt. Tense. Painful. Odd for a True Worlder, but perhaps not for a girl lost in Junction. He was intrigued, but her story didn’t matter. His story mattered.\n\n“Tell me where it is, Maxine.”\n\nShe grew restless, crossed her legs back and forth, then her arms, then finished the bottle of something blue. Synthwaves continued to ripple around them, the beat grew faster, and she nodded her head in sync, gaze fixed on his face. She bit her lip.\n\n“I don’t have it. Not any more,” she said.\n\n“Where?”\n\nShe bit harder, pushed against the seat, and strained against herself until she almost gave in. Almost.\n\n“Protect me, promise me you’ll protect me.” She was pleading. Her voice trembled.\n\nDove did not flinch, but he pursed his lips. He had made promises once. They broke, and people died. He was blamed. By himself, and others. The struggle had been beaten out of him on the Arch. The Illumination had been unwilling to endure such a fault.\n\n“I don’t make promises,” he said.\n\nShe cried—silently, slowly. Streaks ran down her cheek, tracing the same lines in her makeup like rainwater in a gutter. Trapped, but she knew what she must do.\n\n“It’s with Arcturus.”\n\n“Arcturus? The moonlight man?” he asked.\n\n“You heard me.”\n\n“What were you doing in Osiron?”\n\n“Too many questions.” She sniffed her last and regained her composure. He couldn’t touch her now—not any more. “Now, I think I’ll refill my bottle, and then I’m going to go dance with my shiny friends. You can join us, you know.”\n\nThe hint of her smile was seductive—back at work. He felt so sad for her. She was grace-fallen, a True Worlder no more. He gave no reply, for none was needed. He picked himself up from the booth and raised a hand to his vision, captured a last memory of the Lady de L'avant, then made his way out, taking care not to drown in the filth of Chunda House.", "timestamp": 1633455952, "digest": "4r4OoEtKQA2ei0nDyJ9ujMksm8TKTRYNdkMMGIberMQ", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}

That's 2019.\n\nBut I'm still confused. I was standing alone in a strange new world.\n\nFortunately, I met [Pet3r_Pan](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_), he brought me into an amazing new world. The people here are sincere, friendly, classless, helpful, and selfless. Most of all, they are very funny! They are [MetaCartel](https://twitter.com/Meta_Cartel), my family.\n\nMore importantly, Pet3r_Pan has taught me a lot and given me a lot of opportunities. If I have achieved anything today, I owe it all to Pet3r_Pan.\n\nWith Pet3r’s help, I started to work for my dream. \n\nBefore I met Pet3r, I thought of many things I can do, including a media platform. But when I met Pet3r for the first time and heard his story about MetaCartel, especially after I joined them, I realized that the things I thought were pretty lame. Because all those things were just for me. I should be doing something for others, for community, for ecosystem, for our world. Do something more meaningful and valuable.\n\nI reminisced about my experiences in the music and film industries, and the entrepreneurs and commuters I met in 2019. They had dreams, but they didn't have any solutions in the existing system. Absolutely, DAO can help them.\n\nSo I knew what I should do. To help more people realize their dreams through DAO. Help those who have talent but no background. Help those who are not good at flattery and just want to be true to themselves.\n\nIt's hard, especially in the country I'm in. Cultural, social, and historical factors make this not easy. I thought an incubator based on the DAO concept was a sustainable way to make the dream a reality.\n\nBut I needed to consider two equally important things at the same time: **business** and **value proposition**. It was hard and I needed to find the balance. At the same time, I needed to handle those team annoyances. Since December 2019, many members have joined and many have left. I have been ecstatic about the addition of these people. I've also been frustrated by the people leaving. Fortunately, instead of sinking, we are getting stronger.\n\nBut we are still far from success. We need to continue to work hard for business while staying true to our value proposition. It's hard, but I'm no longer alone now. I believe we can overcome anything. I believe we can build a real community for those dreamers, those who have talent but no background, those who aren't good at flattery and just want to be true to themselves. Helping them to be successful. I believe.\n\nThis's the story of [DAOSquare](https://twitter.com/DAOSquare) and me.\n\nI am 41 years old. I don't have enough time left compared to the people around me. I hope to realize my dream sooner, or, after I'm gone, have a solid community that will carry it forward.\n\nI’m Typto, the summoner of DAOSquare. If you have the same dream, please join us!", "timestamp": 1633463378, "digest": "9ZYqqqtt0hZnN8CMEcIqxIcHjsx3WAriS1zrc4UnB2M", "contributor": "0x9ac9c636404C8d46D9eb966d7179983Ba5a3941A"}
{"id": "G3gtuQwLaWmN87Qp7QnUHoDrl4km-uBOrECd1RJC0Tw", "title": "Chapter One: The Slaves of Yerushem", "body": "“Your life means nothing,” spat the tyrant. He lashed his reed, long and thin and strong and trailing braided parchment. His strike cracked open wounds not yet healed, and blood seeped over red-stained skin—a fresh coat to ensure the ever-presence of the pain and consequence of the tyrants, brutes empowered by the Authority of Zayeen.\n\n The slave Diaden did not cry out, as doing so would only invite another blow. Instead, he pushed harder against the plank jutting out from the chariot that had until then been carrying a pair of important patricians—aristocrats with the added benefit of being a part of the Authority’s diplomatic service—along the road north to Yerushem, the capital city and home to the young imperator. The slave Joben pushed hard on the other side of the chariot even as he was whipped again. But despite Diaden’s and Joben’s exertions, the wheels of the chariot would not budge from the mud in which they had sunk. They were left to catch their breath and wipe the sweat from their brows. It was an especially hot day, even by summer standards—and it was always hot in Zayeen. When one asked how much hotter it may get, the answer was we’ll know when the Joona runs dry and the sands of Etial turn to glass.\n\n“Useless,” said the tyrant Tolvar, and he punctuated his statement with another set of lashes, drawing more blood from scarred tissue. He then walked away to liaise with the patricians, who had become threatened with a walk along the road in their ornate leathers and heavy robes, ridiculous attire for a long journey with no shade. The occupants of several accompanying chariots looked upon the slaves with squinted eyes under furrowed brows, as if it was their fault. Though the other chariots were not stuck, none could abandon the safety of the procession, so in the mud they had found themselves nonetheless. Each chariot sported banners and awnings displaying the proud eagle of the Zayeen, and while each sheltered from the sun, they hung limp, moved by no wind, no breeze to tease away the sun’s vengeful kiss.\n\nThe slave Diaden noticed, too, so when he fell back into the mud, exhausted, he found it quite surprising to find the mud cool on his skin and quick to dry. To his knowledge, there was no mud to be found along this road—and had travelled many in his life before slavery, and during—for where was there any water in the middle of the country, so far from the coast, the Joona River, or the Gulel lake?\n\nCovering his eyes to shield the rays of the blazing sun, he peered ahead to where Tolvar jabbered at the patricians and made heavy motions, his reed still hanging from his arm, braids flailing about in the dryness of the early afternoon. Despite his pleading, the soured faces of the patricians did not improve. Diaden strained to make out the conversation, but only heard a few words—important words.\n\n“Summon… Magus...not far.”\n\nDiaden looked over at Joben, who lay flat in the mud and caked his body with the substance, giggling to himself as he did. “Did he say Magus?” \n\n“Sounded like it,” Joben replied with a lilt. The boy bled from his lip, and one of his eyes was swollen shut, but his mood stayed light, as always. Diaden nodded but said nothing more. He looked up into a cloudless sky, squinting in the shine. Perhaps if he blinded himself there would be no use for him. *No*, he thought. The tyrants would find something for him to do. And he still wanted to live to see the sun rise the next day, and the next. No one knew what the future held—so it was said by Nefari.\n\n*“What remains after the sun sets?*” he recalled probing the tribe’s elder on a day he had found himself alone with the old woman. *“If we knew, why would we close our eyes at night?”* she had replied with all the wisdom she carried.\n\nTolvar returned from his parley. Diaden scampered to his feet, bringing himself to attention, and wiped dried mud from his limbs. He kicked dirt at Joben, and the boy, too, stood up and cleaned off. Flakes crumbled to the ground around them. They were pillars of ash amidst a scorched earth.\n\nWhen Tolvar arrived, he eyed the pair with contempt as he passed by. Then he jumped into the chariot and laid back, kicking his feet up over the side and bracing his head with meaty paws. “Go,” he commanded. “We will need food and water for five.”\n\nJoben winced as Diaden protested. “There is food in the stores,” said the slave Diaden. Joben did not enjoy the same relations with the tyrant as Diaden. The boy didn’t understand.\n\nDiaden was right about the food, of course. The chariot was laden with supplies for the journey. They had travelled many leagues north from the southern city of Etial, jewel of the southern province, but had barely scratched the surface of the resources available. They could have travelled many more leagues if needed, and the abundance seemed a waste but for the aristocratic passengers, who demanded luxury at all times. In the end, Diaden’s rightness meant nothing, and he expected another lashing for the audacity of speaking without invitation.\n\nNone came. Tolvar did not move from his relaxed posture, but his biceps bulged. “Do not speak again. Go find food.” Tolvar was never angry when most dangerous. It was the calm way in which he delivered his words Diaden had come to fear.\n\nJoben looked at Diaden in his way, one green eye pleading, face turned down and chin pointing toward the field to the side of the road. No doubt he worried Diaden would continue to be defiant and earn them punishment. Joben was the weaker of the two, but Diaden could not allow himself to be reckless with another’s life. It was not the Nefari way.\n\nSo he stayed silent as he turned his back to the chariot and dragged mud-caked feet into the patchwork of grass dotting the rolling fields of the countryside. Joben hurried alongside, and they walked together with noses down, searching the parched earth beneath them for signs of berries. They saw several ground vermin scampering about, but Tolvar would not feed the patricians so poorly, nor allow the tortured pair to eat so well. Berries for the aristocratic passengers would be best, and if lucky the tyrant may allow water from the stores.\n\n“Do you really think a Magus is coming to help us, Diaden?” Joben’s question bore a hint of wonder. Diaden considered long before answering—perhaps too long, as Joben began to shuffle his feet and wring his hands. The older of them took a deep breath and—\n\n*An ocean breeze*?\n\nA crisp wind had sprung up from nowhere, carrying memories Diaden could never forget. Had they wandered so far outland from the roadway they’d approached the coast? It would explain the presence of mud along roads showing a faint rust. Diaden remembered the orange affectations clearly. He had been shocked to see the road in disarray, unkempt and vegetation allowed to grow over the intricate and iron-lined bricks laid long ago.\n\nHad the patricians this far east neglected to maintain their structures? Diaden could not imagine the architecture of Yerushem left to decay. No wonder rebellion had sprung in Solem, the western city at the cusp of the sea—or so he’d heard. Many things were said in the darkness of the pits, after the day’s labour, when lips were loose and minds weak—whether fact or fiction, Diaden could not say.\n\n“*The sky is blue, and the grass is green*,” Diaden recalled saying. “*How do you know?*” had come the elder’s reply, accompanied by a wry smile. *“I see it,”* he had said. The elder had not accepted the obvious answer. *“But do I?”* she had asked. *“You must!”* he had exclaimed. *“Why? Why must I?*” They had spent the rest of their afternoon going back and forth in this way, until finally the elder had said only, *“Live with one brow raised*.*”* He had not understood. Many years later, Diaden realized the importance of scrutiny—the need to resist the sway of emotion and the moment. This paradigm had served Diaden well throughout his life, although it had done nothing to prevent a fate controlled by the tyrants.\n\n“I don’t know,” Diaden answered Joben at last. “We could not break free the chariot, and the patricians will need to be getting places and attending to things in Yerushem. The tyrant cannot afford their ire. It might be true.”\n\nJoben appeared enthused. “I’ve never seen one—a Magus. I’ve only heard stories.”\n\nDiaden offered nothing in reply. Sometimes there was no value in speaking the truth—or in speaking words at all, for that matter. The elder had taught him as much, and so it was said by Nefari. Joben would not understand, and if he were to try he would never let Diaden be free of his questions and ponderings.\n\n“Up ahead!” Joben exclaimed, breaking Diaden’s thoughts as the boy pointed to a prominent mound of grass tipped with bushes sporting different-coloured berries. It was a Fasha bush—rare, indeed. Diaden remember picking from them as a child to stock for the Nefari’s monthly moon festivals. The memory of the sweetness of the berries permeated his mouth, only to be masked by the desiccated reality of the arid landscape. While Joben ran to the bush, Diaden walked, suddenly saddened by circumstance.\n\nWhen Joben arrived at the top of the mound, he did not immediately begin to scavenge, or risk filling his mouth with berries to let loose their flavourful juices. Instead he stood still as a flag with no wind to fly, and gazed east, beyond the mound on which he was erected. Diaden wanted to see what had captured his attention, and finally began to move his feet with haste, scrambling the last few steps up the hill.\n\nAnd then he saw.\n\nThey stood at the crest of a valley, amidst the foothills stretching south from the Rocca mountains, whose snowy peaks could be seen far in the distance to the north, much further than Yerushem. They overlooked the sea, a vast pool of water stretching across the horizon and shimmering with the reflection of the sun. They looked down into the bottom of the valley, next to the coast, and the city of Solem.\n\nThe image below him was haunting.\n\nSolem was a beautiful city, full with many tall structures of intricate designs, circled by a sculpted, curving wall at its base, tallest where the tide flowed inward. Gulls swooped overhead and called out to each other, and Diaden was calmed by the gentle crashing of waves over silk-white sand. He had not seen the sea for many years, but it had not changed, still majestic, a waving blanket of crystal blue. The breeze caressed his skin, refreshing his pores and invading his nostrils, and tears welled in his eyes. In all his travels with the Nefari around the small country of Zayeen, it was there in the east, at the precipice of the sea, where he had once found his peace. His love.\n\nFor a moment, however fleeting, he found it again. For a moment, sand squished between his toes and laughter rippled around him—innocent and joyful. For a moment, he ran on the beach, and she ran beside him, grabbing at his hand and pleading for him to slow down, only to surge ahead when he did. For a moment, he was happy.\n\nThe memory passed, and Diaden looked down on pillars of smoke rising from different locations within the city. No caravans or lines of traders filtered in and out, as he would have expected from a large metropolis. The streets of Yerushem, for instance, were filled with a constant stream to and from the gates, feeding the great markets and the grand establishments of the Zayeen Authority. But there, just below, Solem did not glitter with a flow of life. It was a skeleton—a fossil—serving to caution those who might seek its shelter or the fancy it might have offered. Diaden did not know what was taking place behind the high walls, but there was no emanating vibrancy—no spirit.\n\n“Why is it burning?” asked Joben.\n\n“Revolution,” said Diaden. He surprised himself with certainty.\n\n“What does that mean?” The boy’s question was innocent, and the struggle to understand played across his face in a furrowed brow and narrowed eye.\n\n“There are men and women like us, Joben, all over Zayeen. Even there,” Diaden pointed, “in Solem. They are resisting.”\n\n“But aren’t there tyrants?” Joben asked.\n\n“There are probably many.”\n\n“Won’t they hurt them?” The boy was too young for this.\n\n“They likely will.”\n\nJoben scrunched his face. “I don’t understand,” he said.\n\nDiaden rested his arm on the boy’s shoulders. Together they looked down upon Solem, but they saw different things. It was not Joben’s fault. He was born in the pits. His mind was not given time to grow, or to flourish.\n\n“Sometimes,” said Diaden, “it makes sense to risk pain for the sake of an idea.” Despite his attempt, this only confused Joben more, but the boy hid it well. He nodded and continued to gaze into the bed of the valley. \n\nA horn blew behind them, back from where they left the chariot in the mud. The tyrant had summoned their return.\n\n“Quick,” Diaden said to Joben. “Gather as many berries as you can.” He obeyed, and each filled their pockets and sacks. Diaden whispered a silent farewell to the coastal vista, but kept the image in the forefront of his mind as he rushed back to the chariot with Joben, bending stalks of grass beneath his hurried tread. He allowed the memory of smoke and desolation to fade into a background of august delight, and chose instead to remember the beauty at the edge of the sea.\n\nThey were not long in their return to the chariot, and on arrival a new figure stood with the tyrant and the patricians, lightly dressed in a sleeveless white shirt and loose-fitting white pants, each billowing in the wind. Diaden could sense the subtle tinge of salt in the air he had missed until standing atop the mount and overlooking the city and the sea, and wondered if they smelled it, too. It is likely they always knew where they were, and how close they were to the open waters at Zayeen’s eastern border, so far from the central roadway connecting the four provinces of the country, and the great cities throughout.\n\n“Bring it here,” said the tyrant, gesturing to the sacks they carried. They obliged, opening it to reveal the berries within. Tolvar reached in for a handful and stuffed them in his mouth, squishing them with his teeth until trickles of red and blue appeared at the corners of his lips, which he licked away.\n\n“Delicious,” he said. “Herus, Daphnus, come—enjoy this feast while the Magus works.” He grabbed the sacks and brought them to the patricians. “You two,” he pointed, “take some water from the stores. Not too much. I will not have you dying on the way to Yerushem.”\n\n“Thank you,” they replied together. The tyrant only scoffed as he began to feed the patricians. Joben moved to the back of the chariot to begin the search for water in the stores, but Diaden stood still, curious and wishing to ask the tyrant a question, even knowing to do so would invite repercussions.\n\n“Were you not afraid we would abscond?” he asked. Joben cowered.\n\nTolvar looked at Diaden with a deadly gaze, and were it not for the feast of fruit affecting his mood, he might have struck his reed. He did not, though; instead, he allowed contempt to drip from his voice as he responded slowly.\n\n“Where would you have absconded?” asked the tyrant.\n\n“We are very near the sea,” he continued unafraid, like a true Nefari. “Can you smell the salt air? It’s there, even if just a hint. And Solem is not far—just over those mounds and down to the coast. I saw it with my own eyes.” He pointed to where they had been.\n\nTolvar considered. His jaw clenched at an angle and his nostrils flared. But his eyes stayed cool and steady, as did the tenor of his voice and cadence of his speech. “You imagine escaping to the lost city?” he said at last.\n\n*Ah*. The tyrant confirmed rebellion in Solem, though Diaden found it curious to consider the city lost. Even he, a tyrant, appeared to have heard the rumours. No doubt the aristocracy had concerned themselves with the plight of Solem’s governance. How long would they allow the city to fend for itself? Diaden caught himself before thinking too deeply, pursuing a rabbit down a hole when a wolf waited nearby.\n\n“I do not imagine escaping,” Diaden said, careful in the tyrant’s presence. Even then he began to doubt the limits he had pushed. “I only ask for your concern.”\n\n“It is not your place to wonder about my concern,” the tyrant snapped, but did not strike. Tolvar only gave Diaden half his attention, too focused on the patricians who gleefully gourded themselves on berries. “There is nowhere for you to go. The Zayeen Authority is particular about those who stray from the roads, or who roam without purpose or permission.” His next words were accompanied by a carnivorous glare from hateful eyes. “You must remember, Nefari.”\n\nThe words sliced. Diaden did remember; all Nefari remembered their expulsion from their home, which was once everywhere, now nowhere.\n\n“You’ve no food and no water except what I provide you,” the tyrant continued. “You would not last one evening alone, and you would not make it to Solem.” Tolvar spoke in his calm manner, delivering facts Diaden could not dispute. “So, no, I was not, and am not, afraid you would abscond. Now go get water and be silent. Ensure you are rested and ready for the remainder of the journey home.” For a moment, Diaden was relieved, but the tyrant was not finished. “If I hear from you again, I will string up your corpse near the gates of Yerushem for the vultures.”\n\nDiaden did not doubt the tyrant for a second, so he did not linger in the tyrant’s presence. He hurried to join Joben at the back of the chariot, where the new arrival clothed in white stood assessing the chariot.\n\nHe was a Magus, thought Diaden, who knew it as surely as the taste of the freedom he lost so long ago. The Nefari often dealt with the Magi—trade, mostly—and offered beds in which to sleep when nights grew long. In turn, the Magi conjured tricks for children and entertained the tribespeople with stories written in the gaps between every flicker of flame from the evening fires. Diaden could still imagine the light-dances in the night sky. \n\n“*Who are they, elder?* He had been just a boy—maybe Joben’s age. Perhaps he forgave Joben’s incessant questioning because he had been the same. *“Wanderers, Diaden, who look after themselves above all, who carry wisdom and lore and pass it from one generation to the next.”* He recalled being fearful, at first. *“Should we not fear them? What do we know about them?”* The elder had been kind, in her way, but firm. *“We may not know much, child, and they may be secretive, but it is for no great mischief. We share the desert with them, and from time to time a story, or a bed. There is nothing to fear.”* He had not been convinced. *“But what of the rumours, elder?”* She had said nothing, and he had pressed. “*Magic is evil*,” he had said. The elder had only reverted to Nefari tenets. “*If you do not know a thing, you cannot judge a thing*.”\n\nDiaden avoided Joben’s awestruck glances as the Magus worked feet away, instead focusing on his search of the stores. The search ended quickly as Diaden’s fingers closed around a pouch of water. He grabbed it, pulled it out, then squeezed it until it released cool fluid, filling his mouth, careful not to drip any to the earth, or to drink too much. He did, though, drink enough to be refreshed before passing the pouch to Joben. The boy seized it and drank heavily. He let out a gasp and raked an arm across his mouth, smearing dirt and dried blood as he did. Then he smiled, a rare sight.\n\nThe Magus paused from his observations of the stuck chariot wheels to watch their revelry. Diaden could not tell his thoughts, so stone-like was his face. There was no movement in his square jaw, nor flicker in grey eyes under heavy brows. Only the bristles of his short, brown hair moved with the wind, but even then just barely. His arms were crossed, and perhaps they were thicker than the tyrant’s. If he never spoke a word, Diaden believed he could come to understand this man, this Magus.\n\nWhen Joben finished with the water, he handed the pouch back to Diaden, who placed it back in the stores as gently as he would cradle a baby. The Magus continued to watch them. Did the Magi support this oppression, Diaden wondered? He realized for this question he had no answer, despite all his dealings with the Magi in his life long ago. What must he have thought looking upon this display of the Zayeen Authority, this tyranny, where the lives of too many were subjected to the whims of the few who believed themselves superior for reason of birth alone.\n\n“You are Nefari,” said the Magus, finally. It was a statement, not a question. His voice was deep, like the ring of a mourner’s bell.\n\n“Yes,” said Diaden, but nothing else. Silence lingered in the air between them, the only sound the rustling of grass. The gulls from the coast did not fly inward that far, nor did any other birds take flight along the road connecting the great cities of Zayeen. The patricians and the tyrant were busy filling their guts with Fasha berries.\n\nAfter a time, the Magus simply nodded and returned to the task of freeing the chariot. Joben looked at Diaden as if to ask a question, but he shrugged before the boy could. Diaden did not know the meaning behind the Magus’s statement, if he meant anything. It was not hard to tell he was Nefari. Even more than their physical appearance, their traits were infamous, and none more so than the tendency to defy—to question—to rebel. Nefari did not accept what was freely offered. All must be earned.\n\nWith the Magus indisposed and the tyrant feasting, Joben and Diaden had nothing to do but wait and watch. Fortunately, they neither waited nor watched for too long. The Magus grasped a wheel, then stretched out to grasp the other. He whispered to himself—murmurs Diaden could not understand—and closed his eyes. And then the chariot moved. It rose, straight up, as if guided, not lifted, by the Magus. The wheels freed themselves from the mud with a pop of suction, and then the Magus released the hint of a grunt as the chariot shifted to the side and set down on the road, liberated from its earthly prison.\n\nJoben emitted a sound of amazement. His one good eye was wide open, and his jaw hung. It was a little feat of magic from the Magus. Diaden knew this; he’d seen it. But it was still impressive, as all unnatural things might be. *Respect what you do not understand*. So it was said by Nefari.\n\nHerus and Daphnus, the patricians—husband and wife no doubt—clapped and rejoiced. Their lips and fingers were stained with the juices from berries, and they had in their glee accidentally rubbed their hands dry on garments more expensive than Diaden could afford in many lifetimes. He fixated on the streaks of red and blue lighting up their robes as they hopped into the chariot, followed by the tyrant.\n\n“Here,” said Tolvar, and he flipped a coin to the Magus. “For your troubles.” The Magus caught the coin but said nothing, and his face remained hard and without expression. “Come now,” said the tyrant, beckoning to Diaden and Joben. His command was loud. He was in a good mood, and he did not lash his reed.\n\nThey had no choice but to obey. Diaden stepped onto the plank affixed to the left side of the chariot and grasped on to a handle on the chariot’s side. As he did, the Magus swiftly reached out and dropped the coin in his pocket. His movement was so fast Diaden had barely the time to register its occurrence, but he knew it to have happened. He doubted anyone else would have seen. The Magus also whispered to him in a voice no one could possibly hear, but somehow it was louder than any direction Tolvar had ever given. By that time Diaden had glanced at the Magus, dumbfounded by the display. The Magus’s lips did not move as he spoke.\n\n“I will find you in Yerushem,” he said.\n\nThen he turned toward his horse, also white, which frolicked in the fields not far away, and walked to join with the beast. At the same time, the tyrant jostled the reins and spurred the chariot’s horses, and they began to trot down the road, pulling behind them the chariot, resuming the journey to Yerushem, the capital city of Zayeen. The Magus faded into the distance as he began to ride west and away from their path.\n\nThe day was hotter than before, and Diaden was unprotected from the sun, and soon he was laced with sweat and caked with dirt. It was uncomfortable, to be sure, but so were all the days of his life. In that space, though, in that time, his mind was somewhere far away.", "timestamp": 1633459578, "digest": "eV3R-W8IXsfFGiTDxECgmbiMwd_x2VYYbF47NG-6RpM", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}

That's 2019.\n\nBut I'm still confused. I was standing alone in a strange new world.\n\nFortunately, I met [Pet3r_Pan](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_), he brought me into an amazing new world. The people here are sincere, friendly, classless, helpful, and selfless. Most of all, they are very funny! They are [MetaCartel](https://twitter.com/Meta_Cartel), my family.\n\nMore importantly, Pet3r_Pan has taught me a lot and given me a lot of opportunities. If I have achieved anything today, I owe it all to Pet3r_Pan.\n\nWith Pet3r’s help, I started to work for my dream.\n\nBefore I met Pet3r, I thought of many things I can do, including a media platform. But when I met Pet3r for the first time and heard his story about MetaCartel, especially after I joined them, I realized that the things I thought were pretty lame. Because all those things were just for me. I should be doing something for others, for community, for ecosystem, for our world. Do something more meaningful and valuable.\n\nI reminisced about my experiences in the music and film industries, and the entrepreneurs and commuters I met in 2019. They had dreams, but they didn't have any solutions in the existing system. Absolutely, DAO can help them.\n\nSo I knew what I should do. To help more people realize their dreams through DAO. Help those who have talent but no background. Help those who are not good at flattery and just want to be true to themselves.\n\nIt's hard, especially in the country I'm in. Cultural, social, and historical factors make this not easy. I thought an incubator based on the DAO concept was a sustainable way to make the dream a reality.\n\nBut I needed to consider two equally important things at the same time: **business** and **value proposition**. It was hard and I needed to find the balance. At the same time, I needed to handle those team annoyances. Since December 2019, many members have joined and many have left. I have been ecstatic about the addition of these people. I've also been frustrated by the people leaving. Fortunately, instead of sinking, we are getting stronger.\n\nBut we are still far from success. We need to continue to work hard for business while staying true to our value proposition. It's hard, but I'm no longer alone now. I believe we can overcome anything. I believe we can build a real community for those dreamers, those who have talent but no background, those who aren't good at flattery and just want to be true to themselves. Helping them to be successful. I believe.\n\nThis's the story of [DAOSquare](https://twitter.com/DAOSquare) and me.\n\nI am 41 years old. I don't have enough time left compared to the people around me. I hope to realize my dream sooner, or, after I'm gone, have a solid community that will carry it forward.\n\nI’m Typto, the summoner of DAOSquare.

{"id": "k9LYKKNjCSz-HjUzGgfXkBvLT5jLG15cLSo7MZ2Iono", "title": "Chapter One: A Man Called Dove", "body": "The solver watched a tall woman hurry down the street. She had blonde hair, and she wore a black coat that billowed around a white dress. Her heels were polished black—the kind the girls wore in the darker places of Junction. Blues and pinks reflected off them and it looked like she was dancing in the rain that hadn’t stopped pouring for a week.\n\nHe sniffed. Sulphur floated in the air and masked the stink of a world gone mad, filled with people who had forgotten themselves, lost in the luxury of light and plenty. There were no more stop signs, no more forks in the road. Desire had become linear, and the path to absolution was paved neon.\n\n“She’s different.” Mai’s voice infiltrated the solver’s thoughts.\n\n“Track her,” said the solver, tapping again at the cylindrical lenses sticking forward from his head. His goggles were special to him. He’d earned them on the Arch, long ago, as a reward for being who he was—who he’d become. Solvers were honed and dangerous. They were weapons made by new men from the ashes of the old world, and he was among the oldest and most dangerous. But also the most tortured. The program had left no visible scars, but they were there, and they were as earned as his vision.\n\nWhere was the woman going? He raised a green-gloved hand to his face and adjusted a lens, spiralling it between nimble fingers, grooves of the lens rippling the soft plastic of his glove.\n\nThe image of the mid-town market shifted; the opaque became clear and the hidden became seen. The woman kept flicking her feet, faster now, purposeful. \n\n“She’s headed to Chunda House,” said Mai inside his head. His Core had found a pattern and crunched the numbers. The solver checked the girl’s direction and made some estimations of his own, then grunted. Chunda House, he wondered. Going to see the Cybs, probably.\n\nThe Cybs were a blight. They were a collection of drugged-up augments who lived only for the next hit—a metaphor for what life had become. During the Reckoning, in that split-second of confusion when Providence had impossibly gone offline—when the city became bathed in darkness and its guardians had gone blind—the Cybs had seized their chance to infect far and wide. They took territory and spread their “religion.” No doubt the girls in the black heels were already paying their dues to their new digital pimps. The tall woman was likely no different. But...\n\n“It feels wrong,” he said.\n\nMai buzzed in his mind. “Maybe it’s just your nanos messing with your head again, Dove.”\n\n“It’s not my fucking nanos.”\n\n“Easy, tiger.”\n\nDove didn’t respond. His Core was right, of course. She was always right. Every day, Dove burned. Every damned day. His creation had been a sin. In all of the Illumination’s glory, while revelling in their brilliance, they hadn’t considered an expiry date, or a shelf-life. Solvers like Dove—old, weary—needed refurbishment often. Too long in the field without care or attention, and they’d suffer silently. Sometimes loudly.\n\nThe Illumination’s agent of light who had delivered Dove’s current instructions had been certain: find Maxine. But Dove doubted a Junction hooker would be the key to finding the Passport and bringing order back to the City, still teetering on the brink of collapse in the wake of the Reckoning. It wouldn’t bring Providence back online. What did the Illumination want with Maxine, he wondered?\n\n“The girl is working with the Cybs, Dove—still think this is a waste of time?” Mai asked.\n\n“Maybe,” he said.\n\nBut he knew better than to second guess his source. Everything led somewhere; everyone wanted something. It’d been two weeks since the Reckoning, and the City had grown darker and more dangerous. Someone had wanted it that way, and Dove would find out why and who. Not for the Illumination, who had commanded his obedience, but for himself. Do this, he had thought, and perhaps he’d earn his freedom.\n\nThe uneasy pact he’d made with the Illumination had led him here, to this back alley in the dregs of the City, watching a girl with black heels scurry into a cartel hole. He followed.\n\nGetting inside wasn’t difficult, despite the gatekeeper. Cybs were small minded, their pride was misplaced, and they were sure in their superiority. Sure, they’d heard of the hack Dove now sent scurrying through the gatekeeper’s neural net, but they did not believe. Military men taking over their implants? Absurd. He flicked his eyes and a series of menus opened. He saw the conjured strings of code within, and he accessed the nanos floating about the bouncer’s brainstem. It took seconds, maybe less. The idiots were still using tech developed in the dawn of the Singularity. It was archaic—slow and clunky. Easy for a solver.\n\nThe doors to Chunda House opened to him and its taint declared itself like a crashing train. Music used to mean something. Now the streets were filled with disconnected tones and beats, waves laced with synth and vibe in sync with the always flickering halogen of the night. It was worse inside—in your face, inescapable, forcing you to recognize its power. The dancers matched the music: thugs with metal limbs and teeth, inhuman faces carved from steel, draped in the finest silk, lugging behind them girls with black heels and other creatures of the night. Everyone drank, liquids thick and thin, blue and red and yellow, each capable of making one forget, or become someone else. Even for a night.\n\n*Not sure why the Cybs bother*, he thought. Their nanos scrubbed it all up before it could take hold of their blood.\n\nThere. The tall woman sat in the corner alone, a bottle of something blue before her on a table shaped  like a flower, each pedal sharp and cold. The solver adjusted his vision, scoped Maxine’s face, and saw the red puffiness of her eyes and cheeks glistening sodium and hate. He pulled at his green glove, snapped it against his wrist, then clenched his teeth. A tick; a tell. A habit he couldn’t stop no matter how stupid it made him, or how weak. A vestige of a former life, all but forgotten. But still with him.\n\nMaxine. The Illumination kept detailed files on targets of interest—so deep that a childhood seemed just another word on a page, chapters of lives running on forever. Her full name was Maxine de L’avant, and she was a True Worlder. Not an original, of course, but descended from pre-singularity lines. Her family name made her wealthy, so why had she decided to waste away in Junction, turning tricks for the Disconnected, and now in the service of Cybs? The question had bothered him since he’d left the Arch.\n\nDrunks and gangsters swept aside before him, desperate to avoid his attention and the shuffle of his black cloak as he pointed his way across the bar to where Maxine sat. Some knew him, sure, and some didn’t; but even those blissfully ignorant sensed him. The night-girl saw him come but did not recoil, wide eyes fixed on his face. He imagined the horror she saw: a square jaw, stubble, and lids for eyes failing to hide the rage within. Maxine dangled a glass from thin fingers, tipped white. She held a pinky to her lips, also white, like her dress. Black and white, Maxine. If it were only so simple.\n\nHe slipped into her booth, rested his arms on the table and clasped his hands. No fear, just curiosity. She didn’t seem to know who he was, or what he was. In the strobing light of the bar, her face pulsed rapidly and his vision corrected to create a full image. She was young, but not too young. A crack at her lips, in her foundation, and a crease in her temple. The way the joints of her knuckles protruded a bit too much, or how she sat back, relaxed, poised. The environment coalesced around her until she was the pinpoint, she was the energy, a beacon in a white dress. What was she doing in a place like this?\n\n“I’ve been looking for you, Maxine.”\n\nShe sipped, and a trickle of blue seeped from the corners of her lips. She caught it with her pinky, licked it off, stared at him with eyeballs round and shining.\n\n“You found me, mystery man.”\n\n“The Cybs?” asked Dove.\n\n“They keep me safe,” she said.\n\n“Is it worth the price?”\n\nShe turned away, brushed her hair with a hand, and rested her elbow on the hard steel top of the booth. He saw it just then—a hesitation. Brief, but real. She was scarred, too. The kind of scars that went unseen except to those who looked.\n\n“Maybe it is. Doesn’t matter. You want a drink?”\n\n“No.” He snapped his glove.\n\n“Fine by me,” she said. Refill. The bottle was almost gone, now. That would have been too much for her alone; someone had come and gone and left her in tears—despondent. Or maybe this was her, all of her, in the flesh. Maxine de L'avant, black heels and all.\n\n“Do you have it?” he asked.\n\nShe paused mid-sip, let the cocktail roll on her tongue and gulped it down. It was enough—confirmation. The agent’s direction to Maxine had been sound, and his information was reliable. The solver’s answers started here.\n\n“I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about, stranger. What did you say your name was?”\n\n“I didn’t.”\n\nHer eyes were focused now, no longer hazy, and she sat straighter. A delicate hand wiped away the last of her dried tears. She sniffed.\n\n“No, I guess you didn’t. Doesn’t take an Elite to figure it out though, where you come from, I mean. That cloak, those eyes, if you can call them that. You’re a solver, aren’t you?”\n\nSo, he thought. She did know what he was.\n\n“Shit,” she continued. “Never thought I’d meet one. Didn’t think they—you—were a real thing, you know? One of those legends that runs through the circuits, a myth of our cybernetic reality, an echo of light and electricity. Who can tell any more what’s real and what’s not. Do you remember? Before, I mean? Life pre-singularity. You should have seen it, solver, it was so beautiful. Green, everywhere—green like your gloves. Fresh air. Quiet. I remember.”\n\n“You’d have been a child, at best,” he said.\n\n“I said I remember, ok?” Curt. Tense. Painful. Odd for a True Worlder, but perhaps not for a girl lost in Junction. He was intrigued, but her story didn’t matter. His story mattered.\n\n“Tell me where it is, Maxine.”\n\nShe grew restless, crossed her legs back and forth, then her arms, then finished the bottle of something blue. Synthwaves continued to ripple around them, the beat grew faster, and she nodded her head in sync, gaze fixed on his face. She bit her lip.\n\n“I don’t have it. Not any more,” she said.\n\n“Where?”\n\nShe bit harder, pushed against the seat, and strained against herself until she almost gave in. Almost.\n\n“Protect me, promise me you’ll protect me.” She was pleading. Her voice trembled.\n\nDove did not flinch, but he pursed his lips. He had made promises once. They broke, and people died. He was blamed. By himself, and others. The struggle had been beaten out of him on the Arch. The Illumination had been unwilling to endure such a fault.\n\n“I don’t make promises,” he said.\n\nShe cried—silently, slowly. Streaks ran down her cheek, tracing the same lines in her makeup like rainwater in a gutter. Trapped, but she knew what she must do.\n\n“It’s with Arcturus.”\n\n“Arcturus? The moonlight man?” he asked.\n\n“You heard me.”\n\n“What were you doing in Osiron?”\n\n“Too many questions.” She sniffed her last and regained her composure. He couldn’t touch her now—not any more. “Now, I think I’ll refill my bottle, and then I’m going to go dance with my shiny friends. You can join us, you know.”\n\nThe hint of her smile was seductive—back at work. He felt so sad for her. She was grace-fallen, a True Worlder no more. He gave no reply, for none was needed. He picked himself up from the booth and raised a hand to his vision, captured a last memory of the Lady de L'avant, then made his way out, taking care not to drown in the filth of Chunda House.", "timestamp": 1633455952, "digest": "4r4OoEtKQA2ei0nDyJ9ujMksm8TKTRYNdkMMGIberMQ", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}

You start spitting across the table, and they’ll definitely kick us out.”\n\nThe brute rolled his eyes but obliged. I shared a look with Aiden, and we shook our heads in unison.\n\nThe three of us sat at a roundtable by the hall’s back wall, having chosen one of the dozen or so that had been assigned to Soldiers. Some other rookies sat alongside us, but I think Benjamin’s savagery kept them from chatting us up.\n\nI scanned the room and guessed that there were around two-hundred people enjoying the buffet. Military members were easy to pick out, since they wore star-shaped pins on their otherwise formal attire. We were told not to wear our combat gear for the banquet, but that we were encouraged to bring a weapon or two.\n\nMy naked sledgehammer dangled from my belt.\n\n“I recognize some of the Philosophers here,” Aiden said. She nodded towards a table several rows closer to the room’s dais than we were. “See them? They write about the nature of laws.”\n\nI looked over at Aiden. She was pale, skinny, and her white-blonde hair somehow reminded me of dying grass. “Why would they be invited to this?”\n\nAiden smiled, her green eyes darting excitedly. “The Wolves make things that Humans could never dream to. I’m sure they’re interested.”\n\nI shrugged my shoulders so that my jacket fell back into place. It was a little big for me, but Mom tried her best. I hated dressing like this. If I wanted to dress up for work, I would’ve joined the ranks of Commerce. “Yeah, well, all that thinking won’t help if the Wolves decide the buffet isn’t cutting it.”\n\nBenjamin let loose a thunderous burp, which earned looks of horror by the other rookies at the table. “I’m with Wyatt. You can’t trust an animal.”\n\n“Didn’t some horde of Wolves try to raid Polygon just last week?” I added.\n\n“Yeah,” Aiden said diffidently, “but those were from the Wildlands. This is different.”\n\n“Uh-huh,” Benjamin muttered. “Don’t see any Humans living in the Wildlands.” He tapped Aiden’s nose. “Don’t be naïve, sweetie. It’ll get you killed.”\n\nAiden grabbed Benjamin’s finger and tossed it away. “Not all problems can be solved with a gun. Read a book, ogre.”\n\n“Books didn’t help me last month against those rhinos,” Benjamin retorted. “Wyatt was there, he’ll tell you. Wyatt?”\n\nI’d only been half-listening to my friends’ banter. My eyes were locked with a man walking towards our table. “What? Sure. Hey, I think Lieutenant Roderick is headed our way.”\n\nEveryone at the table straightened up at that, including me. I had more reason than the others—Roderick was \\*my \\*Lieutenant, my direct commander.\n\n“Hey,” he said when he reached me.\n\nI kept eye contact and prayed that I didn’t have food on the sides of my mouth. “Sir.”\n\n“Come find me after the ceremony. I have a job for you.”\n\nI suppressed the excitement and curiosity that threatened to leak through my face. “Yessir.”\n\nWith a nod, the strong-jawed Lieutenant walked away. The rest of the rookies at the table looked at me, but I ignored them. Once Roderick was out of earshot, I whispered to Benjamin and Aiden, “Guess I’m his favorite.”\n\nBenjamin snorted. “He probably wants you on cleaning duty.”\n\n“You don’t think an event like this is already covered by the Assembly?” I retorted. “No way. This’ll be something interesting.”\n\nThe background chatter of the room suddenly died. I looked towards the dais to see a bald, round man, dressed in an ocean-blue suit and white shirt, standing alone at its center. It was difficult to make out the pin on his jacket lapel, but I already knew what it was—a metallic square with three squiggly horizontal lines etched on its surface. The symbol of Humanity, of Polygon, of our leadership class.\n\nWe’d had the honor of meeting this man on our last day of training, when we were officially inaugurated into the Military. Clovis, the First Assemblyman, second in political authority only to the Ruler himself.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen!” Clovis said cheerfully into a small microphone that ran from his ear down to his mouth. “I thank you all for attending this most historic event. For thousands of years, we have lived our lives in Polygon as an isolated people. And we’ve been good at it. Our art flourishes.” He gestured at the right-hand wall, on which hung a large painting of hooded Philosophers buried in books. “Our men and women of Commerce ensure that our people’s needs are satisfied. Our Industry folk keep Polygon running without fail. And, of course, our Military keeps the peace, both within our walls and without them.”\n\n“He’s buttering up the crowd,” I muttered to my friends. “He knows working with Wolves is a tough sell.”\n\nAiden put a finger to her lips.\n\nBenjamin was right. I didn’t know how she made the cut.\n\n“But there is more to the world than Polygon. Many of you may not know this, but the Wolves have engineered some of the most astonishing creations I have ever seen. I’ve been there myself. Their world is one of gears and chemicals and things as magical as Godlets themselves. And while I’m proud of what Humankind has achieved, we can benefit from those on the other side of the continent.\n\n“The last trade with Wolves that the Assembly approved of was over thirty years ago. Many in this room will not have remembered it, and not only because there are so many young faces in attendance. It hardly lasted more than a week. Complications…arose.” The First Assemblyman clasped his hands together and smiled devilishly, as if he were about to land a punchline. “But failures of the past do not compel us to relinquish possibilities of the future. With *The Principles of Earth and Blood*, we are boundless.”\n\nHe paused, and everyone clapped to fill the brief silence.\n\n“Now, please welcome our guest of honor as he joins me. Bogg is a renowned mogul at the Builder’s Mountains. He has brought his daughter, Kara, along with him. A round of applause, please!”\n\nWhile we obliged his request, two figures entered the dais from behind its back curtain and stood by Clovis. Both wore elegant white outfits that I nearly mistook for bathrobes, but the fabric was far finer than anything I’d wear on a lazy morning, and their clothes shone as brightly as snow under the sun. Odder than their stylistic choice was that the clothing was literally *moving*—their tops gently rippled from left to right, as if dozens of tiny ocean waves were rolling underneath in rapid, successive, rhythmic fashion.\n\nBoth of them wore jewelry from head to toe, each ornament cut from a different gem. Their dangling, blood-red earrings and their sparkling, gray bracelets rotated in perfect harmony with the mechanical dance of their robes. More than half of their fingers were decorated with gemstone rings. Those, at least, stood still.\n\nTheir faces…my hand instinctively went to my hammer as I took them in, man and girl. Both were utterly covered in what looked like billions of thin whiskers. It was almost disgusting to look at. The larger man’s hair was mostly dark gray with a few dashes of white interspersed from his dome to his mane. The girl’s hair was similar in character, but it was the yellow-green of spring leaves.\n\n*She-Wolves have beards. Noted.*\n\nTheir fangs extended down what I guessed was past their chins, but they were too hairy—or too whiskery—to tell. While the man-Wolf was definitely lean for his size, the girl was definitely too skinny to be healthy. Even with all of that hair, I could see her sunken cheeks.\n\nAs our applause died down, the taller of the pair offered a deep, long bow. “Hello to you all,” he boomed in a deep, confident voice. “My daughter and I thank you for your hospitality. I’ve already met some of you when we landed earlier today. My name is Bogg, and this is Kara.”\n\nThe girl waved to the crowd with both hands, as if trying to make a joke. She stumbled forward, and for a second, I thought she’d trip over her feet.\n\nBogg’s gaze never left us, and he continued unabated. “My team and I have been in communication with Clovis and his cohort for years, ironing out the details of this deal. The Great Builder has granted all of us most fortuitous circumstances. You see, I have learned that underneath Polygon may rest undiscovered veins of metals and other valuable materials. If I understand correctly, you all use much of this metal for what you call ‘money’. But we don’t have this ‘money’ in the Builder’s Mountains. We employ the Great Builder’s seeds towards far more creative ends. With his gifts, we fertilize the world.”\n\nI frowned. *Was that a dig at us?*\n\nI noticed other faces turn sour, too.\n\nBut Bogg either didn’t notice, or he didn’t care. “We have had toys that sniff out the earth’s riches long before I came into contact with your people. We call them ‘metal detectors’. With knowledge of how Polygon runs, my team created a specialized device just for you, your own artificial bug. But I digress. I won’t bore you with details here, nor with a demonstration. Roderick and the rest of your Assembly have already seen its efficacy.\n\n“Your men of Industry will receive shipments of my toys. It has been agreed upon that I will receive some modest fraction of any metals that my bugs discover for you.” Bogg paused. “This is—”\n\nKara took a wobbly step forward, and an explosion of bile and chunks of who-knows-what rocketed from her mouth.\n\nBenjamin yelled profanity, but it was drowned out by the hundred other yells of shock. I looked wide-eyed towards my friends. “She’s drunk,” I muttered. “Guess booze hits Wolves the same way it hits us.”\n\n“Okay, okay!” Clovis shouted, as Bogg grabbed his daughter by the arm and quickly fell back behind the curtain from which they came. “I’m terribly sorry, friends. Kara must be unwell. In any case, I thank you all for attending once again. Have a good night, everyone.”\n\nPeople immediately began shuffling out of the hall. I saw staff who had been silently standing against the walls begin to clean up the place, including the vomit on the dais.\n\n“That was weird,” Aiden said as the three of us rose to our feet.\n\n“Yep,” Benjamin muttered. “This guy’s supposed to be our friend, or something? He brought his drunk daughter to his welcome ceremony. He’s spitting in our faces.”\n\n“No,” Aiden responded. “I mean, I’ve read about the Wolves. They normally raise their children communally. It’s odd that Bogg has a daughter of his own at all.”\n\n“Guess your books don’t have all the answers, after all,” Benjamin teased.\n\n“I *did* know that Wolves don’t have a currency,” Aiden protested.\n\nI put my fist out. “Much as I’d love to stick around, I’m gonna find Lieutenant Roderick. I’ll see you back at the hotel.”\n\nMy friends took turns bumping my fist, and I headed towards the table I had seen Roderick sitting at. When I turned his way, I saw that everyone at his table had already left, except him.\n\nHe was waiting for me.\n\n“Uh, sir,” I said as I approached his backside. “You wanted to see me?”\n\nRoderick turned his head but remained seated and utterly still. “Sit for a second, Wyatt.”\n\nI did, and I turned my chair so that we were face-to-face. “What can I do for you?”\n\nThe Lieutenant’s dimples showed as he held back a grin. “Some ceremony, eh?”\n\n“Seems like the Assembly will approve the deal.”\n\nRoderick laughed. “Relax, Wyatt. It’s just you and me here.” Now his face did break out in a flashy smile. “What do you really think?”\n\n“I, um…” I broke eye contact with my commander. “Sorry, I don’t know what to say, sir.”\n\n“Hey, kid, listen to me. Look at me. You’re, what, nineteen-years-old? You’ve been in the Military for less than a year. I’ve seen you in training. In action. You’ve got more drive than most rookies I’ve come across.”\n\nI looked back at Roderick and did my best to suppress the elation that wanted to leap out of my throat. “Really?”\n\nRoderick winked at me and nodded. “Between you and me. You’re passionate about your job. How long have you wanted to join the Military?”\n\n“I never considered another profession, sir.”\n\n“Figured as much. You could go a long way, kid. I see it. And I’m in your camp. Know that.”\n\n“I appreciate that. I…don’t know what to say.”\n\nHis playful expression again broke out in a chuckle. “You said that already. Now, I ask again: what did you think of that ceremony?”\n\n“Well…I don’t understand why Bogg would bring his daughter out if she’s such a liability.”\n\nRoderick nodded. “Go on.”\n\n“I don’t know what’s going on with—what was her name, Kara? If Bogg wanted to earn our trust or respect, why would he have brought his drunk daughter onto the dais? Unless his judgment is that poor, in which case we shouldn’t be trading with him in the first place. Or maybe he did it on purpose, to spit in our face. It’s dicey enough working with any Wolf, let alone a stupid or malevolent one.”\n\n“Why is that?”\n\nMy nerves had faded away, and I leaned closer towards my Lieutenant. “Humans should stick to our own. Things are good enough at Polygon. Clovis said it himself. Why entangle ourselves with another race?” I shook my head. “They’re not worth it.”\n\n“There it is,” Roderick said approvingly. “I might agree with you, kid. But you know, maybe Bogg’s technology will land us gold. More money is never a bad thing. I don’t know, honestly. I hadn’t heard about the details until his speech.”\n\n“He was mocking us,” I snapped. “He called his own technology ‘toys’ several times. Like we’re just receiving the bottom of the barrel. Screw him and his drunk daughter.”\n\n“Okay, okay!” Roderick held his hands up teasingly. “I hear you. I don’t like working with them, either.” He shrugged his shoulders. “But you’re wrong about one thing, Wyatt. Things can \\*always \\*get better.”\n\n“Yeah well,” I muttered. “I guess we’ll see.”\n\n“And speaking of his ‘drunk daughter’, as you called her. That’s why I wanted to talk to you.”\n\nI sat back in my chair. “Oh?”\n\nRoderick cocked his head and looked vaguely puzzled. “You were in attendance when their ship landed earlier today. I know the two of them exited very quickly and were escorted away, but did you by any chance make eye contact with Kara?”\n\nI pursed my lips. “Not at all. To be totally honest, I barely looked at them.”\n\n“Not curious to see what a Wolf looked like? I know you hadn’t seen one yet, out in the Wildlands.”\n\n“Nope. Not at all. They’re not us.”\n\nRoderick snorted. “Fair enough. And you’ve been in my sights for the last few hours. You couldn’t have interacted with her since then.”\n\n“Sir, what’s this about?”\n\n“She wants a night out on the town. Apparently she wants to check out the Capital’s bar scene. From what I’m told, she requested you as her tour guide.”\n\nI frowned. “What? That’s my task?”\n\nRoderick nodded. “Yeah. Not the sexiest order I’ll give you, but there it is. They’re our guests, so it’s not really our call.”\n\n“No, I get that. Bogg’s going to let her out after that debacle? How old is she, anyway?”\n\n“I don’t know. Couple years younger than you, I guess, though the beard makes it hard to tell.”\n\nI ran a hand through my hair, unsure how to react. “I…don’t like this. I don’t want to talk to these Wolves. I definitely don’t want to babysit some drunk.”\n\n“I get it. Think of it as security service. I don’t know how these Wolves choose to live, and I certainly wouldn’t let my kid out after humiliating me. Who knows, maybe that’s going to be the case. Before the ceremony, my superior had told Bogg that you’d meet her outside her hotel at nine p.m. Maybe she won’t show. But if she does, you’re there to protect her.”\n\nI grinned at my Lieutenant. “I do like that better than babysitting.”\n\nHe lightly punched me in the arm. “There you go. Oh, and don’t change your clothes. Let’s keep a professional face.”\n\n“Definitely.”\n\n“Do you know where \\*No Rules \\*is? It’s a high-end bar just a few blocks from where Kara and Bogg are staying.”\n\nI nodded. “Yeah. I’ve never gone in, though. Last time I was in the Capital was when we passed our training. My friends and I celebrated in the area.”\n\n“I’m sure you did. Here.”\n\nRoderick pulled out something from his jacket pocket and handed me half a dozen heavy golden coins. I looked at them and saw the same insignia inscribed on them that was on Clovis’ pin. I whistled. “This isn’t your money, is it?”\n\n“Of course not. I like you, but not that much. The Assembly’s covering whatever Kara wants tonight.”\n\n“I won’t drink,” I assured him.\n\nHe smiled proudly at me. “I know you won’t. Look, I know it won’t be the most fun job, but I’ll make sure people know you did it well.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. Do you know why she chose me?”\n\nRoderick rose to his feet, and I followed suit. He extended a rough, calloused hand to me. I met his grip. “You have an hour to yourself before you’re on duty. I have no idea why she insisted on you, but you can ask her. Might be a good way to bypass small talk, anyway. Good luck, Wyatt. I’ll see you in the morning.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. For everything. I won’t let you down.”\n\nWith one last charming grin, my commander walked away and left the banquet hall.\n\nI looked around and realized that no one was left but the cleaning crew and me. I closed my eyes and took a breath.\n\n*One night. One Wolf.

You start spitting across the table, and they’ll definitely kick us out.”\n\nThe brute rolled his eyes but obliged. I shared a look with Aiden, and we shook our heads in unison.\n\nThe three of us sat at a roundtable by the hall’s back wall, having chosen one of the dozen or so that had been assigned to Soldiers. Some other rookies sat alongside us, but I think Benjamin’s savagery kept them from chatting us up.\n\nI scanned the room and guessed that there were around two-hundred people enjoying the buffet.

Now, I ask again: what did you think of that ceremony?”\n\n“Well…I don’t understand why Bogg would bring his daughter out if she’s such a liability.”\n\nRoderick nodded. “Go on.”\n\n“I don’t know what’s going on with—what was her name, Kara? If Bogg wanted to earn our trust or respect, why would he have brought his drunk daughter onto the dais? Unless his judgment is that poor, in which case we shouldn’t be trading with him in the first place. Or maybe he did it on purpose, to spit in our face. It’s dicey enough working with any Wolf, let alone a stupid or malevolent one.”\n\n“Why is that?”\n\nMy nerves had faded away, and I leaned closer towards my Lieutenant. “Humans should stick to our own. Things are good enough at Polygon. Clovis said it himself. Why entangle ourselves with another race?” I shook my head. “They’re not worth it.”\n\n“There it is,” Roderick said approvingly. “I might agree with you, kid. But you know, maybe Bogg’s technology will land us gold. More money is never a bad thing. I don’t know, honestly. I hadn’t heard about the details until his speech.”\n\n“He was mocking us,” I snapped. “He called his own technology ‘toys’ several times. Like we’re just receiving the bottom of the barrel. Screw him and his drunk daughter.”\n\n“Okay, okay!” Roderick held his hands up teasingly. “I hear you. I don’t like working with them, either.” He shrugged his shoulders. “But you’re wrong about one thing, Wyatt. Things can *always *get better.”\n\n“Yeah well,” I muttered. “I guess we’ll see.”\n\n“And speaking of his ‘drunk daughter’, as you called her. That’s why I wanted to talk to you.”\n\nI sat back in my chair. “Oh?”\n\nRoderick cocked his head and looked vaguely puzzled. “You were in attendance when their ship landed earlier today. I know the two of them exited very quickly and were escorted away, but did you by any chance make eye contact with Kara?”\n\nI pursed my lips. “Not at all. To be totally honest, I barely looked at them.”\n\n“Not curious to see what a Wolf looked like? I know you hadn’t seen one yet, out in the Wildlands.”\n\n“Nope. Not at all. They’re not us.”\n\nRoderick snorted. “Fair enough. And you’ve been in my sights for the last few hours. You couldn’t have interacted with her since then.”\n\n“Sir, what’s this about?”\n\n“She wants a night out on the town. Apparently she wants to check out the Capital’s bar scene. From what I’m told, she requested you as her tour guide.”\n\nI frowned. “What? That’s my task?”\n\nRoderick nodded. “Yeah. Not the sexiest order I’ll give you, but there it is. They’re our guests, so it’s not really our call.”\n\n“No, I get that. Bogg’s going to let her out after that debacle? How old is she, anyway?”\n\n“I don’t know. Couple years younger than you, I guess, though the beard makes it hard to tell.”\n\nI ran a hand through my hair, unsure how to react. “I…don’t like this. I don’t want to talk to these Wolves. I definitely don’t want to babysit some drunk.”\n\n“I get it. Think of it as security service. I don’t know how these Wolves choose to live, and I certainly wouldn’t let my kid out after humiliating me. Who knows, maybe that’s going to be the case. Before the ceremony, my superior had told Bogg that you’d meet her outside her hotel at nine p.m. Maybe she won’t show. But if she does, you’re there to protect her.”\n\nI grinned at my Lieutenant. “I do like that better than babysitting.”\n\nHe lightly punched me in the arm. “There you go. Oh, and don’t change your clothes. Let’s keep a professional face.”\n\n“Definitely.”\n\n“Do you know where *No Rules *is? It’s a high-end bar just a few blocks from where Kara and Bogg are staying.”\n\nI nodded. “Yeah. I’ve never gone in, though. Last time I was in the Capital was when we passed our training. My friends and I celebrated in the area.”\n\n“I’m sure you did. Here.”\n\nRoderick pulled out something from his jacket pocket and handed me half a dozen heavy golden coins. I looked at them and saw the same insignia inscribed on them that was on Clovis’ pin. I whistled. “This isn’t your money, is it?”\n\n “Of course not. I like you, but not that much. The Assembly’s covering whatever Kara wants tonight.”\n\n“I won’t drink,” I assured him.\n\nHe smiled proudly at me. “I know you won’t. Look, I know it won’t be the most fun job, but I’ll make sure people know you did it well.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. Do you know why she chose me?”\n\nRoderick rose to his feet, and I followed suit. He extended a rough, calloused hand to me. I met his grip. “You have an hour to yourself before you’re on duty. I have no idea why she insisted on you, but you can ask her. Might be a good way to bypass small talk, anyway. Good luck, Wyatt. I’ll see you in the morning.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. For everything. I won’t let you down.”\n\nWith one last charming grin, my commander walked away and left the banquet hall.\n\nI looked around and realized that no one was left but the cleaning crew and me. I closed my eyes and took a breath.\n\n*One night. One Wolf. One job.*\n\n*I got this.*\n\n————————————————————————————————————\n\n*I thank Sam Nix, Kitt Johnson, Matt McLernon, JP Doherty, Joe Immen, Jaime Pellegrin, Julio Torres, Neil Hudson, David Perlmutter, Diana Cimino, and Ahmad Abdulla for their continued support.*\n\n*If you also enjoy Windfall and wish to support my writing, you may do so via Patreon at https\\://www\\.patreon.com/Fallibleanimals.

{"id": "S-yomnLZYmnAFZNUe_sFuaQO91lIKm0hm0LoCjIg7Z4", "title": "Chapter One: The Slaves of Yerushem", "body": "“Your life means nothing,” spat the tyrant. He lashed his reed, long and thin and strong and trailing braided parchment. His strike cracked open wounds not yet healed, and blood seeped over red-stained skin—a fresh coat to ensure the ever-presence of the pain and consequence of the tyrants, brutes empowered by the Authority of Zayeen.\n\n The slave Diaden did not cry out, as doing so would only invite another blow. Instead, he pushed harder against the plank jutting out from the chariot that had until then been carrying a pair of important patricians—aristocrats with the added benefit of being a part of the Authority’s diplomatic service—along the road north to Yerushem, the capital city and home to the young imperator. The slave Joben pushed hard on the other side of the chariot even as he was whipped again. But despite Diaden’s and Joben’s exertions, the wheels of the chariot would not budge from the mud in which they had sunk. They were left to catch their breath and wipe the sweat from their brows. It was an especially hot day, even by summer standards—and it was always hot in Zayeen. When one asked how much hotter it may get, the answer was we’ll know when the Joona runs dry and the sands of Etial turn to glass.\n\n“Useless,” said the tyrant Tolvar, and he punctuated his statement with another set of lashes, drawing more blood from scarred tissue. He then walked away to liaise with the patricians, who had become threatened with a walk along the road in their ornate leathers and heavy robes, ridiculous attire for a long journey with no shade. The occupants of several accompanying chariots looked upon the slaves with squinted eyes under furrowed brows, as if it was their fault. Though the other chariots were not stuck, none could abandon the safety of the procession, so in the mud they had found themselves nonetheless. Each chariot sported banners and awnings displaying the proud eagle of the Zayeen, and while each sheltered from the sun, they hung limp, moved by no wind, no breeze to tease away the sun’s vengeful kiss.\n\nThe slave Diaden noticed, too, so when he fell back into the mud, exhausted, he found it quite surprising to find the mud cool on his skin and quick to dry. To his knowledge, there was no mud to be found along this road—and had travelled many in his life before slavery, and during—for where was there any water in the middle of the country, so far from the coast, the Joona River, or the Gulel lake?\n\nCovering his eyes to shield the rays of the blazing sun, he peered ahead to where Tolvar jabbered at the patricians and made heavy motions, his reed still hanging from his arm, braids flailing about in the dryness of the early afternoon. Despite his pleading, the soured faces of the patricians did not improve. Diaden strained to make out the conversation, but only heard a few words—important words.\n\n“Summon… Magus...not far.”\n\nDiaden looked over at Joben, who lay flat in the mud and caked his body with the substance, giggling to himself as he did. “Did he say Magus?” \n\n“Sounded like it,” Joben replied with a lilt. The boy bled from his lip, and one of his eyes was swollen shut, but his mood stayed light, as always. Diaden nodded but said nothing more. He looked up into a cloudless sky, squinting in the shine. Perhaps if he blinded himself there would be no use for him. *No*, he thought. The tyrants would find something for him to do. And he still wanted to live to see the sun rise the next day, and the next. No one knew what the future held—so it was said by Nefari.\n\n*“What remains after the sun sets?*” he recalled probing the tribe’s elder on a day he had found himself alone with the old woman. *“If we knew, why would we close our eyes at night?”* she had replied with all the wisdom she carried.\n\nTolvar returned from his parley. Diaden scampered to his feet, bringing himself to attention, and wiped dried mud from his limbs. He kicked dirt at Joben, and the boy, too, stood up and cleaned off. Flakes crumbled to the ground around them. They were pillars of ash amidst a scorched earth.\n\nWhen Tolvar arrived, he eyed the pair with contempt as he passed by. Then he jumped into the chariot and laid back, kicking his feet up over the side and bracing his head with meaty paws. “Go,” he commanded. “We will need food and water for five.”\n\nJoben winced as Diaden protested. “There is food in the stores,” said the slave Diaden. Joben did not enjoy the same relations with the tyrant as Diaden. The boy didn’t understand.\n\nDiaden was right about the food, of course. The chariot was laden with supplies for the journey. They had travelled many leagues north from the southern city of Etial, jewel of the southern province, but had barely scratched the surface of the resources available. They could have travelled many more leagues if needed, and the abundance seemed a waste but for the aristocratic passengers, who demanded luxury at all times. In the end, Diaden’s rightness meant nothing, and he expected another lashing for the audacity of speaking without invitation.\n\nNone came. Tolvar did not move from his relaxed posture, but his biceps bulged. “Do not speak again. Go find food.” Tolvar was never angry when most dangerous. It was the calm way in which he delivered his words Diaden had come to fear.\n\nJoben looked at Diaden in his way, one green eye pleading, face turned down and chin pointing toward the field to the side of the road. No doubt he worried Diaden would continue to be defiant and earn them punishment. Joben was the weaker of the two, but Diaden could not allow himself to be reckless with another’s life. It was not the Nefari way.\n\nSo he stayed silent as he turned his back to the chariot and dragged mud-caked feet into the patchwork of grass dotting the rolling fields of the countryside. Joben hurried alongside, and they walked together with noses down, searching the parched earth beneath them for signs of berries. They saw several ground vermin scampering about, but Tolvar would not feed the patricians so poorly, nor allow the tortured pair to eat so well. Berries for the aristocratic passengers would be best, and if lucky the tyrant may allow water from the stores.\n\n“Do you really think a Magus is coming to help us, Diaden?” Joben’s question bore a hint of wonder. Diaden considered long before answering—perhaps too long, as Joben began to shuffle his feet and wring his hands. The older of them took a deep breath and—\n\n*An ocean breeze*?\n\nA crisp wind had sprung up from nowhere, carrying memories Diaden could never forget. Had they wandered so far outland from the roadway they’d approached the coast? It would explain the presence of mud along roads showing a faint rust. Diaden remembered the orange affectations clearly. He had been shocked to see the road in disarray, unkempt and vegetation allowed to grow over the intricate and iron-lined bricks laid long ago.\n\nHad the patricians this far east neglected to maintain their structures? Diaden could not imagine the architecture of Yerushem left to decay. No wonder rebellion had sprung in Solem, the western city at the cusp of the sea—or so he’d heard. Many things were said in the darkness of the pits, after the day’s labour, when lips were loose and minds weak—whether fact or fiction, Diaden could not say.\n\n“*The sky is blue, and the grass is green*,” Diaden recalled saying. “*How do you know?*” had come the elder’s reply, accompanied by a wry smile. *“I see it,”* he had said. The elder had not accepted the obvious answer. *“But do I?”* she had asked. *“You must!”* he had exclaimed. *“Why? Why must I?*” They had spent the rest of their afternoon going back and forth in this way, until finally the elder had said only, *“Live with one brow raised*.*”* He had not understood. Many years later, Diaden realized the importance of scrutiny—the need to resist the sway of emotion and the moment. This paradigm had served Diaden well throughout his life, although it had done nothing to prevent a fate controlled by the tyrants.\n\n“I don’t know,” Diaden answered Joben at last. “We could not break free the chariot, and the patricians will need to be getting places and attending to things in Yerushem. The tyrant cannot afford their ire. It might be true.”\n\nJoben appeared enthused. “I’ve never seen one—a Magus. I’ve only heard stories.”\n\nDiaden offered nothing in reply. Sometimes there was no value in speaking the truth—or in speaking words at all, for that matter. The elder had taught him as much, and so it was said by Nefari. Joben would not understand, and if he were to try he would never let Diaden be free of his questions and ponderings.\n\n“Up ahead!” Joben exclaimed, breaking Diaden’s thoughts as the boy pointed to a prominent mound of grass tipped with bushes sporting different-coloured berries. It was a Fasha bush—rare, indeed. Diaden remember picking from them as a child to stock for the Nefari’s monthly moon festivals. The memory of the sweetness of the berries permeated his mouth, only to be masked by the desiccated reality of the arid landscape. While Joben ran to the bush, Diaden walked, suddenly saddened by circumstance.\n\nWhen Joben arrived at the top of the mound, he did not immediately begin to scavenge, or risk filling his mouth with berries to let loose their flavourful juices. Instead he stood still as a flag with no wind to fly, and gazed east, beyond the mound on which he was erected. Diaden wanted to see what had captured his attention, and finally began to move his feet with haste, scrambling the last few steps up the hill.\n\nAnd then he saw.\n\nThey stood at the crest of a valley, amidst the foothills stretching south from the Rocca mountains, whose snowy peaks could be seen far in the distance to the north, much further than Yerushem. They overlooked the sea, a vast pool of water stretching across the horizon and shimmering with the reflection of the sun. They looked down into the bottom of the valley, next to the coast, and the city of Solem.\n\nThe image below him was haunting.\n\nSolem was a beautiful city, full with many tall structures of intricate designs, circled by a sculpted, curving wall at its base, tallest where the tide flowed inward. Gulls swooped overhead and called out to each other, and Diaden was calmed by the gentle crashing of waves over silk-white sand. He had not seen the sea for many years, but it had not changed, still majestic, a waving blanket of crystal blue. The breeze caressed his skin, refreshing his pores and invading his nostrils, and tears welled in his eyes. In all his travels with the Nefari around the small country of Zayeen, it was there in the east, at the precipice of the sea, where he had once found his peace. His love.\n\nFor a moment, however fleeting, he found it again. For a moment, sand squished between his toes and laughter rippled around him—innocent and joyful. For a moment, he ran on the beach, and she ran beside him, grabbing at his hand and pleading for him to slow down, only to surge ahead when he did. For a moment, he was happy.\n\nThe memory passed, and Diaden looked down on pillars of smoke rising from different locations within the city. No caravans or lines of traders filtered in and out, as he would have expected from a large metropolis. The streets of Yerushem, for instance, were filled with a constant stream to and from the gates, feeding the great markets and the grand establishments of the Zayeen Authority. But there, just below, Solem did not glitter with a flow of life. It was a skeleton—a fossil—serving to caution those who might seek its shelter or the fancy it might have offered. Diaden did not know what was taking place behind the high walls, but there was no emanating vibrancy—no spirit.\n\n“Why is it burning?” asked Joben.\n\n“Revolution,” said Diaden. He surprised himself with certainty.\n\n“What does that mean?” The boy’s question was innocent, and the struggle to understand played across his face in a furrowed brow and narrowed eye.\n\n“There are men and women like us, Joben, all over Zayeen. Even there,” Diaden pointed, “in Solem. They are resisting.”\n\n“But aren’t there tyrants?” Joben asked.\n\n“There are probably many.”\n\n“Won’t they hurt them?” The boy was too young for this.\n\n“They likely will.”\n\nJoben scrunched his face. “I don’t understand,” he said.\n\nDiaden rested his arm on the boy’s shoulders. Together they looked down upon Solem, but they saw different things. It was not Joben’s fault. He was born in the pits. His mind was not given time to grow, or to flourish.\n\n“Sometimes,” said Diaden, “it makes sense to risk pain for the sake of an idea.” Despite his attempt, this only confused Joben more, but the boy hid it well. He nodded and continued to gaze into the bed of the valley. \n\nA horn blew behind them, back from where they left the chariot in the mud. The tyrant had summoned their return.\n\n“Quick,” Diaden said to Joben. “Gather as many berries as you can.” He obeyed, and each filled their pockets and sacks. Diaden whispered a silent farewell to the coastal vista, but kept the image in the forefront of his mind as he rushed back to the chariot with Joben, bending stalks of grass beneath his hurried tread. He allowed the memory of smoke and desolation to fade into a background of august delight, and chose instead to remember the beauty at the edge of the sea.\n\nThey were not long in their return to the chariot, and on arrival a new figure stood with the tyrant and the patricians, lightly dressed in a sleeveless white shirt and loose-fitting white pants, each billowing in the wind. Diaden could sense the subtle tinge of salt in the air he had missed until standing atop the mount and overlooking the city and the sea, and wondered if they smelled it, too. It is likely they always knew where they were, and how close they were to the open waters at Zayeen’s eastern border, so far from the central roadway connecting the four provinces of the country, and the great cities throughout.\n\n“Bring it here,” said the tyrant, gesturing to the sacks they carried. They obliged, opening it to reveal the berries within. Tolvar reached in for a handful and stuffed them in his mouth, squishing them with his teeth until trickles of red and blue appeared at the corners of his lips, which he licked away.\n\n“Delicious,” he said. “Herus, Daphnus, come—enjoy this feast while the Magus works.” He grabbed the sacks and brought them to the patricians. “You two,” he pointed, “take some water from the stores. Not too much. I will not have you dying on the way to Yerushem.”\n\n“Thank you,” they replied together. The tyrant only scoffed as he began to feed the patricians. Joben moved to the back of the chariot to begin the search for water in the stores, but Diaden stood still, curious and wishing to ask the tyrant a question, even knowing to do so would invite repercussions.\n\n“Were you not afraid we would abscond?” he asked. Joben cowered.\n\nTolvar looked at Diaden with a deadly gaze, and were it not for the feast of fruit affecting his mood, he might have struck his reed. He did not, though; instead, he allowed contempt to drip from his voice as he responded slowly.\n\n“Where would you have absconded?” asked the tyrant.\n\n“We are very near the sea,” he continued unafraid, like a true Nefari. “Can you smell the salt air? It’s there, even if just a hint. And Solem is not far—just over those mounds and down to the coast. I saw it with my own eyes.” He pointed to where they had been.\n\nTolvar considered. His jaw clenched at an angle and his nostrils flared. But his eyes stayed cool and steady, as did the tenor of his voice and cadence of his speech. “You imagine escaping to the lost city?” he said at last.\n\n*Ah*. The tyrant confirmed rebellion in Solem, though Diaden found it curious to consider the city lost. Even he, a tyrant, appeared to have heard the rumours. No doubt the aristocracy had concerned themselves with the plight of Solem’s governance. How long would they allow the city to fend for itself? Diaden caught himself before thinking too deeply, pursuing a rabbit down a hole when a wolf waited nearby.\n\n“I do not imagine escaping,” Diaden said, careful in the tyrant’s presence. Even then he began to doubt the limits he had pushed. “I only ask for your concern.”\n\n“It is not your place to wonder about my concern,” the tyrant snapped, but did not strike. Tolvar only gave Diaden half his attention, too focused on the patricians who gleefully gourded themselves on berries. “There is nowhere for you to go. The Zayeen Authority is particular about those who stray from the roads, or who roam without purpose or permission.” His next words were accompanied by a carnivorous glare from hateful eyes. “You must remember, Nefari.”\n\nThe words sliced. Diaden did remember; all Nefari remembered their expulsion from their home, which was once everywhere, now nowhere.\n\n“You’ve no food and no water except what I provide you,” the tyrant continued. “You would not last one evening alone, and you would not make it to Solem.” Tolvar spoke in his calm manner, delivering facts Diaden could not dispute. “So, no, I was not, and am not, afraid you would abscond. Now go get water and be silent. Ensure you are rested and ready for the remainder of the journey home.” For a moment, Diaden was relieved, but the tyrant was not finished. “If I hear from you again, I will string up your corpse near the gates of Yerushem for the vultures.”\n\nDiaden did not doubt the tyrant for a second, so he did not linger in the tyrant’s presence. He hurried to join Joben at the back of the chariot, where the new arrival clothed in white stood assessing the chariot.\n\nHe was a Magus, thought Diaden, who knew it as surely as the taste of the freedom he lost so long ago. The Nefari often dealt with the Magi—trade, mostly—and offered beds in which to sleep when nights grew long. In turn, the Magi conjured tricks for children and entertained the tribespeople with stories written in the gaps between every flicker of flame from the evening fires. Diaden could still imagine the light-dances in the night sky. \n\n“*Who are they, elder?* He had been just a boy—maybe Joben’s age. Perhaps he forgave Joben’s incessant questioning because he had been the same. *“Wanderers, Diaden, who look after themselves above all, who carry wisdom and lore and pass it from one generation to the next.”* He recalled being fearful, at first. *“Should we not fear them? What do we know about them?”* The elder had been kind, in her way, but firm. *“We may not know much, child, and they may be secretive, but it is for no great mischief. We share the desert with them, and from time to time a story, or a bed. There is nothing to fear.”* He had not been convinced. *“But what of the rumours, elder?”* She had said nothing, and he had pressed. “*Magic is evil*,” he had said. The elder had only reverted to Nefari tenets. “*If you do not know a thing, you cannot judge a thing*.”\n\nDiaden avoided Joben’s awestruck glances as the Magus worked feet away, instead focusing on his search of the stores. The search ended quickly as Diaden’s fingers closed around a pouch of water. He grabbed it, pulled it out, then squeezed it until it released cool fluid, filling his mouth, careful not to drip any to the earth, or to drink too much. He did, though, drink enough to be refreshed before passing the pouch to Joben. The boy seized it and drank heavily. He let out a gasp and raked an arm across his mouth, smearing dirt and dried blood as he did. Then he smiled, a rare sight.\n\nThe Magus paused from his observations of the stuck chariot wheels to watch their revelry. Diaden could not tell his thoughts, so stone-like was his face. There was no movement in his square jaw, nor flicker in grey eyes under heavy brows. Only the bristles of his short, brown hair moved with the wind, but even then just barely. His arms were crossed, and perhaps they were thicker than the tyrant’s. If he never spoke a word, Diaden believed he could come to understand this man, this Magus.\n\nWhen Joben finished with the water, he handed the pouch back to Diaden, who placed it back in the stores as gently as he would cradle a baby. The Magus continued to watch them. Did the Magi support this oppression, Diaden wondered? He realized for this question he had no answer, despite all his dealings with the Magi in his life long ago. What must he have thought looking upon this display of the Zayeen Authority, this tyranny, where the lives of too many were subjected to the whims of the few who believed themselves superior for reason of birth alone.\n\n“You are Nefari,” said the Magus, finally. It was a statement, not a question. His voice was deep, like the ring of a mourner’s bell.\n\n“Yes,” said Diaden, but nothing else. Silence lingered in the air between them, the only sound the rustling of grass. The gulls from the coast did not fly inward that far, nor did any other birds take flight along the road connecting the great cities of Zayeen. The patricians and the tyrant were busy filling their guts with Fasha berries.\n\nAfter a time, the Magus simply nodded and returned to the task of freeing the chariot. Joben looked at Diaden as if to ask a question, but he shrugged before the boy could. Diaden did not know the meaning behind the Magus’s statement, if he meant anything. It was not hard to tell he was Nefari. Even more than their physical appearance, their traits were infamous, and none more so than the tendency to defy—to question—to rebel. Nefari did not accept what was freely offered. All must be earned.\n\nWith the Magus indisposed and the tyrant feasting, Joben and Diaden had nothing to do but wait and watch. Fortunately, they neither waited nor watched for too long. The Magus grasped a wheel, then stretched out to grasp the other. He whispered to himself—murmurs Diaden could not understand—and closed his eyes. And then the chariot moved. It rose, straight up, as if guided, not lifted, by the Magus. The wheels freed themselves from the mud with a pop of suction, and then the Magus released the hint of a grunt as the chariot shifted to the side and set down on the road, liberated from its earthly prison.\n\nJoben emitted a sound of amazement. His one good eye was wide open, and his jaw hung. It was a little feat of magic from the Magus. Diaden knew this; he’d seen it. But it was still impressive, as all unnatural things might be. *Respect what you do not understand*. So it was said by Nefari.\n\nHerus and Daphnus, the patricians—husband and wife no doubt—clapped and rejoiced. Their lips and fingers were stained with the juices from berries, and they had in their glee accidentally rubbed their hands dry on garments more expensive than Diaden could afford in many lifetimes. He fixated on the streaks of red and blue lighting up their robes as they hopped into the chariot, followed by the tyrant.\n\n“Here,” said Tolvar, and he flipped a coin to the Magus. “For your troubles.” The Magus caught the coin but said nothing, and his face remained hard and without expression. “Come now,” said the tyrant, beckoning to Diaden and Joben. His command was loud. He was in a good mood, and he did not lash his reed.\n\nThey had no choice but to obey. Diaden stepped onto the plank affixed to the left side of the chariot and grasped on to a handle on the chariot’s side. As he did, the Magus swiftly reached out and dropped the coin in his pocket. His movement was so fast Diaden had barely the time to register its occurrence, but he knew it to have happened. He doubted anyone else would have seen. The Magus also whispered to him in a voice no one could possibly hear, but somehow it was louder than any direction Tolvar had ever given. By that time Diaden had glanced at the Magus, dumbfounded by the display. The Magus’s lips did not move as he spoke.\n\n“I will find you in Yerushem,” he said.\n\nThen he turned toward his horse, also white, which frolicked in the fields not far away, and walked to join with the beast. At the same time, the tyrant jostled the reins and spurred the chariot’s horses, and they began to trot down the road, pulling behind them the chariot, resuming the journey to Yerushem, the capital city of Zayeen. The Magus faded into the distance as he began to ride west and away from their path.\n\nThe day was hotter than before, and Diaden was unprotected from the sun, and soon he was laced with sweat and caked with dirt. It was uncomfortable, to be sure, but so were all the days of his life. In that space, though, in that time, his mind was somewhere far away.", "timestamp": 1633459578, "digest": "eV3R-W8IXsfFGiTDxECgmbiMwd_x2VYYbF47NG-6RpM", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}

That's 2019.\n\nBut I'm still confused. I was standing alone in a strange new world.\n\nFortunately, I met [Pet3r_Pan](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_), he brought me into an amazing new world. The people here are sincere, friendly, classless, helpful, and selfless. Most of all, they are very funny! They are [MetaCartel](https://twitter.com/Meta_Cartel), my family.\n\nMore importantly, Pet3r_Pan has taught me a lot and given me a lot of opportunities. If I have achieved anything today, I owe it all to Pet3r_Pan.\n\nWith Pet3r’s help, I started to work for my dream. \n\nBefore I met Pet3r, I thought of many things I can do, including a media platform. But when I met Pet3r for the first time and heard his story about MetaCartel, especially after I joined them, I realized that the things I thought were pretty lame. Because all those things were just for me. I should be doing something for others, for community, for ecosystem, for our world. Do something more meaningful and valuable.\n\nI reminisced about my experiences in the music and film industries, and the entrepreneurs and commuters I met in 2019. They had dreams, but they didn't have any solutions in the existing system. Absolutely, DAO can help them.\n\nSo I knew what I should do. To help more people realize their dreams through DAO. Help those who have talent but no background. Help those who are not good at flattery and just want to be true to themselves.\n\nIt's hard, especially in the country I'm in. Cultural, social, and historical factors make this not easy. I thought an incubator based on the DAO concept was a sustainable way to make the dream a reality.\n\nBut I needed to consider two equally important things at the same time: **business** and **value proposition**. It was hard and I needed to find the balance. At the same time, I needed to handle those team annoyances. Since December 2019, many members have joined and many have left. I have been ecstatic about the addition of these people. I've also been frustrated by the people leaving. Fortunately, instead of sinking, we are getting stronger.\n\nBut we are still far from success. We need to continue to work hard for business while staying true to our value proposition. It's hard, but I'm no longer alone now. I believe we can overcome anything. I believe we can build a real community for those dreamers, those who have talent but no background, those who aren't good at flattery and just want to be true to themselves. Helping them to be successful. I believe.\n\nThis's the story of [DAOSquare](https://twitter.com/DAOSquare) and me.\n\nI am 41 years old. I don't have enough time left compared to the people around me. I hope to realize my dream sooner, or, after I'm gone, have a solid community that will carry it forward.\n\nI’m Typto, the summoner of DAOSquare. If you have the same dream, please join us!", "timestamp": 1633463322, "digest": "2YzLXe9hC0FRxxvIPaqEoCCtvoE9FGT_TLxqSnVCKL4", "contributor": "0x9ac9c636404C8d46D9eb966d7179983Ba5a3941A"}

Other Soldiers and Lieutenants came and went, but I hardly noticed.\n\n“Yeah,” I muttered as I stared at my empty plate.\n\n“What about last night?” Benjamin said after swallowing a mountain of scrambled eggs. “Did Roderick have you on cleaning duty, after all?”\n\nI shook my head. “He had me watch over Kara.”\n\n“Bogg’s daughter?” Aiden asked. “Why you?”\n\n“Apparently, she picked me.”\n\n“Okay,” Aiden said. She sounded concerned. “Well, do you—”\n\nI turned to her sharply. “Look, I don’t want to talk about it. Okay? I’m sorry. Not now.”\n\n“Maybe when we’re back in Torque City, you’ll tell us about it,” Benjamin said, and I could hear the grin on his face. “I’m dying to know what that mess was like.”\n\n“Yeah. Maybe.”\n\n“We’re all meeting with our Lieutenants today at noon,” Aiden said. “I’m guessing they’ll tell us to head back soon, now that the banquet is finished.”\n\nI shot to my feet and headed over to the drinks station, where I poured myself a quarter-full glass of water.\n\nMy hand shook as I brought the drink to my mouth.\n\nI stood there for a solid minute, staring idly out the window on the far side of the room. It looked to be another sunny, autumn day in the Capital. I saw a woman walking with several little kids, all with an innocent, cheerful demeanor. They were probably headed to some apprenticeship, where the children would learn about the occupation of their choosing. In every other city in Polygon, I’d be able to make a rough guess at what that occupation might be—I could have at least whittled it down to a Sector. But the Capital had its own layout, and I had never taken the time to memorize its map.\n\n“Wyatt.”\n\nI turned to see Lieutenant Roderick, dressed in casual Military gear: a jacket, a solid undershirt, and baggy, unadorned pants. His jacket was striped in the deep blue and marble white that were Polygon’s official colors, while his pants and undershirt were plain black. His hawkish face was taut with something between sleeplessness and a grave severity I’d never seen on him before.\n\nNext to my commander stood a tall, athletic woman in her fifties, dressed similarly to Roderick. I’d never spoken to her before, but I knew that she was Roderick’s boss: Captain Maura. Her cheekbones were sharp enough to cut metal, and her short, graying hair hung down to just above her left shoulder. Her small eyes matched her stern expression, and they fell on me with a kind of patient pressure, like a predator confident enough to take the day off from hunting. Worse, her eyes’ dark brown irises were decorated with flecks of silver. The three stars on her jacket, paired with her authoritative stance, only served to intimidate me further.\n\nI felt underdressed in my gray t-shirt and old, faded gray sweatpants.\n\n“Sir,” I said as casually as I could. I put a hand out to Maura. “You’re Captain Maura. It’s an honor to meet you.”\n\nAs the Captain shook my hand, she looked at me the way one might stare with terrified fascination at a sleeping beast of the jungle. “Roderick tells me you were with Kara last night,” she said quietly.\n\n“Yes, ma’am,” I replied, mirroring her low voice.\n\nShe continued to stare at me, hard, and I struggled to retain eye contact. “Is there anything you want to tell us?”\n\n“She was goading me all night,” I answered without missing a beat. “I think she knew I was adopted, somehow. It was eerie. And…she was hostile.”\n\n“Walk us through your night,” Roderick said. “After I last saw you, where’d you go?”\n\nI put my hands behind my back. I didn’t want them to see that they were shaking.\n\n“I went to Kara’s hotel, like you told me to. She met me in the lobby, and we walked to *No Rules*.”\n\n“Did anything unusual happen on your way there, or maybe in the bar?” Roderick asked. I saw Maura glance at him before returning her iron gaze back at me.\n\n“There was a man in a hood at the bar,” I said. “I couldn’t see his face or anything.”\n\n“That’s good, Wyatt,” Roderick said. He almost sounded…relieved?\n\n“Think hard,” Maura said, ignoring my Lieutenant’s interjection. “What else happened at the bar?”\n\nI scratched my head, scrolling through my memories. Then I realized what she was hinting at. “She mentioned my mother by name. I…I grabbed her coat. But I let go. I didn’t hurt her.”\n\n“We know,” Maura said. “What about after the bar?”\n\n“I walked Kara back to her hotel.”\n\n“Give me more than that,” she snapped acerbically.\n\nI looked past Maura towards my friends, who I knew would be watching the three of us.\n\n*I’m sorry.*\n\n“She invited me up to her room,” I whispered. “And I attacked her. I more than grabbed her by the coat.”\n\n“Because she threatened you?” Roderick asked.\n\n“Like I said, she was dropping passive-aggressive hints about me and my family all night. About things she has no business knowing.”\n\n“Be specific,” Maura commanded. “Tell us what you did.”\n\nMy vision blurred, but I swallowed my growing anxiety. “I…I took her by the throat.” I turned away from Maura’s unrelenting eyes. “I told her that I’d kill her if she came near me or my family. And then I left.” I couldn’t stop a humiliating tear from falling to the wooden floor. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”\n\n“You left,” Maura muttered suspiciously. “And you returned here?”\n\n“Yes,” I answered while I wiped my cheek. I looked to Roderick. “Hey, what’s going on?”\n\nRoderick opened his mouth, but Maura raised a placating hand without so much as looking his way. “Did you speak with anyone else at Kara’s hotel?” she asked.\n\nI shook my head. “Someone let us in, but I didn’t speak to her. I didn’t pay much attention after we entered the hotel, but there was staff around.”\n\nMaura nodded very slightly. “You need to come with us. Now.”\n\nI tried to gesture to my friends, but Maura grabbed me by the bicep and practically dragged me out of the hotel.\n\n“Captain, he won’t run away,” Roderick said as we began walking the streets of the Capital. “I know him.”\n\n“Neither you nor I know what he’s capable of,” Maura retorted, and she tightened her grip on me.\n\nThe three of us walked as hastily as we could along the busy sidewalk. In the morning sun, I took in the massive, stony buildings on both sides of the road. I remembered Kara’s complaint that they were too bland and angular. She was right about their style—every building was made of off-white stone, stacked in such a way that although the the stones themselves were sturdy, cylindrical, horizontal columns, they nevertheless shaped the building into a perfect rectangular prism in the aggregate. Even the roofs were flat, composed of those same round stones. Flagpoles extended from half of the windowsills, carrying the blue-and-white banner of Polygon. Each building’s foundation rested on an individuated metallic platform that extended a few feet around its perimeter, gradually tapering off until it melded with its surroundings. From a few lucky angles, I could see a circular divot in some of the buildings’ roofs, within which three narrow lines of indentation formed an equilateral triangle whose ends didn’t quite connect.\n\nAfter a few blocks, I knew we were headed to Kara’s hotel.\n\n*Don’t panic. Don’t speak.*\n\nAs we neared the hotel, I noticed that the sidewalk was becoming sparser with citizens. And everyone we did pass looked…distressed.\n\nA faint but nasty scent hit my nostrils, like raw meat drenched in shit. I looked to Maura, but she either didn’t pick up on it or chose not to react.\n\nIt only grew stronger and more putrid as we came closer to the hotel. By the time we reached the block of the hotel, it had evolved from a mere background smell to one that I could nearly taste on my tongue.\n\nThere were no civilians on the hotel’s block. I saw dozens of Military men and woman, mostly in groups of three or four, standing cross-armed and sober. As we walked past them towards the hotel, we received several curious stares.\n\nOr maybe \\*I \\*did.\n\nThe sidewalk and street grew more and more dense with Military as we neared the hotel. By the time we were two buildings away, Maura stopped in her tracks and put a hand on Roderick’s shoulder. “Go tell them that we have the suspect and come back.”\n\nRoderick nodded, gave me a smile that tried to be encouraging, and headed onwards.\n\nI saw the defeat in his eyes.\n\nMaura’s grip on my bicep tightened further.\n\nI don’t know how much time went by before Roderick returned. His valiant attempts at comforting me were gone from his expression, replaced by airtight professionalism.\n\nThe rational part of my mind had put the pieces together, but I couldn’t allow the thoughts to congeal into sentences.\n\n“They’re ready,” he said to Maura.\n\nMilitary personnel cleared the way as the Captain pulled me towards the hotel. The smell was nauseating by now.\n\nThe sidewalk area before the hotel was blocked from view as a handful of older Military men stood in the way. As the three of us approached them, they turned and looked at me. I had never seen them before, but my guess was they weren’t always so pale.\n\nThey walked towards us in such a way as to form a semicircle, which was creepy enough. But in doing so, I saw what had been occupying them.\n\nI was lucky that I’d barely eaten that morning.\n\nSprawled on the sidewalk was a headless, feminine body. Dried blood stained her wool coat, which continued to light up in fluorescent colors as they had when its owner was alive. Her entire neck was clean gone, leaving a gaping hole that was, thankfully, partly covered by her large coat. Even so, I glimpsed with dark curiosity.\n\nI dry heaved and turned my face away. Her insides looked no different from those of Creatures that we’d occasionally had to split open, out in the Wildlands. And yet, much as I distrusted Wolves, I had to admit that seeing the lifeless, literally open carcass of someone who could talk was far more unsettling. Someone—granted, not a Human—was suddenly no different from a dead animal.\n\nI heard a scream of primal pain coming from where Kara’s body laid. I looked back, and in my shock, I hadn’t even registered Bogg. He was on his knees with his hairy hands holding Kara’s feet.\n\n“The woman who was guarding the hotel’s front door is dead, too,” Maura said quietly in my ear. I instinctively pulled my arm away from her grip at the increasing hostility in her voice, but she was strong. “As are the concierge and another worker who worked last night’s shift.”\n\n“Didn’t do this,” I fumbled, staring mindlessly at the sky. It was more comforting than the hell that was closing in on me.\n\n“All three were found in the hotel with their skulls cracked open.”\n\nImagined, ghastly visuals painted what had been a serene, cloudless sky. I turned to Maura and opened my mouth, but no words came out.\n\n“Witnesses at \\*No Rules \\*have confirmed that you had your hammer with you,” Maura said flatly. “And I’ve already told you that your physical aggression against Kara was seen by numerous patrons.”\n\nThe semicircle of Military men closed in on me. They looked very large.\n\nOr maybe I just felt small.\n\nFinally, Maura released me. She took Roderick’s side to my right and said, loudly against the wails of a grieving father, “The Humans you murdered had families. And Kara was an official guest of the Assembly. \\*The Principles of Earth and Blood \\*is clear. You have violated Law number eight-hundred-and-sixty-two of the Second Book, the punishment for which is five days of confinement, followed by execution.”\n\nOne of the men took my limp wrists. My eyes were on Maura, but I felt the cold, biting steel as the man bound my hands. I felt a tug by my waist, and I turned to find the man unhooking my hammer from my belt. I wanted to resist, to say something, anything.\n\nBut I was frozen.\n\n“And according to Law number fifty-five, you are hereby discharged from the Military. None of your accomplishments as such will ever be recorded again, and any such records that are found are to be erased.”\n\nThe man ripped the star pin off of my shirt.\n\nThe scene was silent. The men looked at me with vacant, ghostly eyes. Maura’s expression remained implacable, the incarnation of the legal order itself, mechanically fulfilling its duty as a lion protected its pack.\n\n“Bogg,” Maura called. “We have him. If you have anything to say to him before his imprisonment, now is the time.”\n\nThe Wolf was a far cry from the confident businessman who delivered a speech just yesterday. His dress was similarly opulent, but his face was…utterly broken. He shook as he took small steps towards me. Face-to-face, his eyes were so bloodshot I would have thought he was diseased if I hadn’t known the circumstances.\n\nHe spat in my face.\n\n“That’s enough,” Roderick protested.\n\nI wiped my face with my bound hands. “Trial,” I said. “I didn’t do any of this.”\n\n“There will be an investigation for the next five days,” Maura answered. “Only if another suspect emerges and seems more likely to have committed this homicide will there be a trial. Even then, the trial must begin and end before your five days of confinement. If this span passes without any of these contingencies, you will die the same way you killed our guest.”\n\nI swallowed at that.\n\n“Roderick, take him to the First Prison. Use the Train.”\n\nI was waiting for Maura to give me some kind of comfort, some assuring words that this would all be sorted out. That I was a Soldier, one of her ranks, a defender of Humanity. That she knew I hadn’t murdered two Humans and decapitated our guest of honor.\n\nThat I wasn’t a snake in the grass, freshly exposed and to be crushed on sight.\n\nRoderick beckoned for me to follow him. As I passed Maura, I whispered, “Tell me you don’t think I did it. Tell me I’m not being sentenced to death.”\n\n“The Law does not compromise,” she said, her voice granite.\n\nA flash of anger erupted inside of me, temporarily subduing the storm of confusion and fear wreaking havoc in my mind. “This is bullshit,” I spat.\n\n“Roderick,” Maura said, her eyes on me, “take this child to his destination.”\n\n“Come on, Wyatt,” my Lieutenant said calmly to me.\n\nAfter several minutes of walking in silence, Roderick said, “The First Prison is expecting you. I’ll be with you until you get there.”\n\nI looked to my commander. “And then what?”\n\n“Like Maura says. Confinement.”\n\n“So that’s it? Toss me in a cell, chop my fucking head off?”\n\nRoderick clenched his jaw. “Maura and I were at \\*No Rules \\*for hours this morning. They were missing a knife, Wyatt.”\n\n“Sir, come on! You know me. Tell me you know it isn’t true.”\n\nHe smiled at me, but gone was the pride in me that I’d seen on his face so many times before. “It doesn’t matter what I think, Wyatt. The first attempted deal with the Wolves in a generation, and a Wolf ends up murdered? That’s enough for a war between our races. This fiasco is bigger than you, kid.”\n\n“Someone’s framing me!” I cried. “I’d never kill a Human. And I already told you, Kara knew things about me. Something is going on.”\n\n“Maybe. Or maybe you’re lying about what Kara said to you.”\n\nRoderick’s words hit me like an icicle through the chest. “You mean that?”\n\n“I don’t know. I’m just tracking the possibilities. Look, there’s still time for you.”\n\n“Five days,” I muttered. “I’ve got no shot. Hey. That asshole in the hood. He’s gotta be connected, somehow.”\n\n“We didn’t know about that until you mentioned it,” Roderick admitted optimistically. “I’ll make sure to follow up on that.”\n\n“Today. *Sir*.”\n\nRoderick snorted mirthlessly. “Guess I’d be impatient if I was in your shoes, too. Yeah, today.”\n\n“Don’t bring Maura. She hates me.”\n\nRoderick shook his head. “First of all, control yourself. Don’t command me.”\n\n“I’m not your Soldier anymore,” I spat. “Remember?”\n\n“Goddammit, Wyatt. I’m trying to offer you a hand, here. Don’t make it so hard. Besides, Maura doesn’t hate you. I’ve told her about you before.”\n\nI would’ve beamed at that on any other day. “I couldn’t tell.”\n\n“Yeah, she can be intense. Closed off. But she’s a damn good Captain. I’ve seen her fight. It’s…something else.”\n\nI remembered the speckles in her eyes. “I didn’t know she had a godlet.”\n\n“One of the most powerful I’ve ever seen. Sharp as hell, too. She knows what the political fallout from Kara’s death could be. She has an ear to the Assembly.”\n\n“So, what, consign me to die?”\n\n“Not her call. An Assemblyman decided earlier today, after he debriefed him.”\n\n“Which one?”\n\n“Does it matter?”\n\n“Of course.”\n\nRoderick shook his head again as he glanced at the chains around my wrists. “Stop thinking with your heart, Wyatt. If you’re going to survive, you need to wise up. Ignore what doesn’t matter. Focus on what does. Got it?”\n\nI felt a pang of relief for the first time all day. Roderick was still in my corner. “I’m sorry,” I said for the billionth time today. “I shouldn’t have disrespected you, Sir.”\n\n“Don’t mention it. Priorities, remember?”\n\n“Right.”\n\nWe approached the busy Train station. Citizens were packed onto an outdoor platform below which several lines of track extended in both directions as far as I could see. Roderick took out a coin and inserted it into the slot of a metallic box at the front of the platform while uttering, “First Prison” into it. The machine repeated his words in an electronic, monotonous voice, and the screen on the box morphed from bright red to light blue.\n\n“Your family will receive a letter soon,” Roderick whispered to me\n\n“This will devastate them,” I said quietly. My hands closed into fists. “Goddammit…” My eyes welled up again, but I heeded Roderick’s advice. “Sir, I know I’m not in a position to ask for anything, but could you tell Aiden and Benjamin what’s going on?”\n\n“I imagine word will spread quickly, but sure, I’ll find them if they’re not already out of the Capital.”\n\n*If Aiden’s already gone, I’m finished.*\n\nA bellowing roar indicated that the Train was approaching.\n\nRoderick kept a delicate hand on my back as we walked forward.\n\nThe First Prison held the worst criminals in Polygon, those violators of \\*The Principles of Earth and Blood \\*who the Assembly itself declared as enemies of Humanity.\n\nAnd soon enough, me.", "timestamp": 1633463659, "digest": "LdQ4TfGoQTATw8J-l1sJpxJ5FVDNlctKfgt5ZqO88dQ", "contributor": "0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC"}
{"id": "VTsWvvare1wJtBgQaFlnZSjMNJR-ANGeM66gCwuvz6E", "title": "Windfall: Chapter Two", "body": "**Chapter Two**\n\nI shouldn’t have been surprised that Kara was late.\n\nBy the time she came down, I’d been standing in the hotel lobby for at least half an hour, according to the massive clock above the concierge’s desk.\n\nThe Wolf walked towards me with the self-assuredness of someone far older than she was. On her tiny frame, it creeped me out, but I held my poker face. At least Kara decided to ditch her vomit-stained clothes from earlier. Now, she wore a wool coat that was at least a size too big. This time, her clothes didn’t wiggle on their own, but irregular splotches of colors grew and faded at seemingly random spots, like living inkblots striving to reach the surface of her coat.\n\nI put a hand out. “I’m Wyatt.”\n\nKara’s storm-cloud gray eyes darted wildly above her sunken cheeks, scanning me erratically. “Of course you are.” Her voice was high and scratchy, but she spoke with a confidence that matched her gait.\n\nI took a breath in. *Is she even sober? Doesn’t matter, don’t ask.* “Shall we?”\n\nKara giggled. “No small talk, my knight?”\n\n“\\*No Rules \\*isn’t far. Come on.”\n\nI turned and headed towards the door without looking back.\n\n“Such a hurry!” she cried as she caught up me. “The night is young, Wyatt. So much playtime.”\n\n\\*Ignore her, \\*I thought to myself as we hit the road. *No one ever got in trouble for keeping their mouth shut.*\n\n“Your roads, at least, have style,” Kara noted.\n\nI instinctively looked down as we walked on the sidewalk. Like all roads and sidewalks in Polygon, it was crystalline and translucent, allowing travelers to see the dense network of metallic pipes that connected all buildings and other structures together. Points of light shone at regular intervals along the pipes, lighting the streets on which we walked.\n\n“Unlike the rest of this dreary city,” the Wolf continued. “Too much stone. Too many angles. Too little for the eyes to feast upon.”\n\n*A few hours of this, and I’m home free.*\n\n“Tell me, Wyatt. Who do you think put those there?”\n\nI followed Kara’s fingers, which were pointing toward the sky. “What are you talking about?”\n\nShe laughed again. “The stars, of course.”\n\nI shrugged. “No idea.”\n\n“You’re not curious.”\n\n“Nope.”\n\n“Your mind is so dull for someone so young,” she teased. “The Great Builder did not create his gifts for you to dismiss so gratuitously. He and his lover placed the stars in the sky so that none of us would face a dreary, black canvass in the night.”\n\nI turned towards Kara. She was still staring at the sky, her nasty green hair hanging like the dead branches of an old tree. “We don’t have a Great Builder,” I quipped.\n\n“Oh, Wyatt, you don’t know much, do you?”\n\n“I know what I need to.”\n\nAs we turned a corner, she said, “And what’s that? You know how to swing your little weapon, there?”\n\nI suddenly felt a pressure by my waist as Kara darted towards me and put a hand on my hammer’s handle.\n\nI pulled away quite easily. Turned out her bark was far worse than her bite—she had the strength of, well, an underfed teenage girl. “What are you doing?” I hissed.\n\n“Are you always so stiff?” she said. “Or do you just do what you’re told, like a good boy?”\n\nI shook my head but said nothing the rest of the way. When Kara realized I wasn’t going to respond, she began whistling some melodramatic tune.\n\n*Keep your cool.*\n\nThree blocks and an eternity later, we arrived at the entrance of \\*No Rules. \\*Its exterior was a clear imitation of Palace Codex, with arched doors and a pair of marble statues of a man and a woman, both upright and nude and reading thick tomes. I heard music and idle chatter from above, and I looked up to see several floors’ worth of balconies, each peppered with impeccably dressed men and women.\n\nPersonally, I preferred a hole in the wall where the beer tasted like piss.\n\nTwo large men with stars on their black shirts stood before the glass doors. Military. As I approached them, I saw their eyes go to my own star, and they nodded with approval.\n\n“Hi,” I said assertively. “This is—”\n\n“We know,” the one on the left said. “We were told to expect the two of you.”\n\n“Wyatt, why don’t you introduce me to your handsome friends?” Kara asked as she intertwined her arm with mine.\n\nI quickly pulled away. “They know,” I muttered.\n\nThe two Military men glanced at each other, and I could tell they were holding in a laugh. “Enjoy your night,” said the one on the right.\n\nI felt my cheeks redden with humiliation.\n\n“What’s the matter, Wyatt boy?” Kara whispered in my ear as we walked through the doors. “You should’ve introduced me.”\n\n*Ignore her. She’s a drunk kid.*\n\nThe opening room was lit by dozens of little candles, dispersed across the tables and the bar. Hypnotic, wordless music came from every direction, too quiet to inhibit conversation but loud enough to prevent any awkward silences. Every surface I could see was dressed in fluffy, pink wool. Most tables were small, circular, and fit for two: most patrons of this part of \\*No Rules \\*were pairs of men and women engaged in a nightly dance of casual courtship. At the bar, I saw a handful of single men and women, mostly drinking alone.\n\nI pretended not to notice the uncomfortable or outright hostile glances Kara and I received when we walked in.\n\n“Hello, are you Wyatt?” a tall, older man in a tuxedo asked me. “My name is Grantham. I was told that you and a special guest would be visiting our quarters tonight.”\n\n“That’s me,” Kara said, and I saw more heads turn our way. “I’m Kara. You don’t look so good, Granty. What’s the matter? Is there something on my face?”\n\n“Em, no, ma’m,” Grantham said nervously. “May I take the two of you to your table? We have one reserved for you.”\n\n“That’d be great,” I said, doing my best to apologize through my expression. “Thank you.”\n\nMuch as I wasn’t exactly a fan of this place’s ambiance, I had to admit that the wooly stool made for a damn comfortable seat.\n\n“If you need anything, please find me,” Grantham said after he handed us drink menus.\n\nOnce he was out of earshot, Kara leaned close enough to me that her silky beard nearly tickled \\*my \\*chin. “Relax, Wyatt,” she whispered slowly. “Now the fun starts.”\n\nIt would’ve been more difficult to give this kid the silent treatment now than while we were walking, I realized. “Why did you want me to come out here with you?”\n\nShe sat back on her stool, still smiling arrogantly, madly. “We’ll get there.” She glanced at her menu for a moment before throwing it back down. “Why don’t you be a good little Soldier and fetch me a shot of whatever costs the most.”\n\n“I think a waiter will take your order once he comes back.”\n\nKara lifted a shaggy eyebrow. “You won’t be joining me?”\n\n“I’m on the clock.”\n\n“Then do what I say,” she said with heat. “And go buy me a drink.”\n\nI got up and stormed to the bar without another word.\n\n“What can I get you?” the bartender asked me.\n\nI pulled out one of the coins that Roderick had given me. “A shot of your most expensive drink.”\n\nHe took the coin and made with the bartending. Part of me wanted to look back at Kara, if only to make sure she hadn’t run off. But I just looked ahead, taking refuge in this brief moment without the Wolf.\n\n“That’s quite a lot of money for someone so…underdressed. And so young!”\n\nI turned to my left to see a blonde woman in a green, glittery dress. “Ah, it’s not mine. It’s for work.”\n\n“I see that,” she said, eyeing my star pin. “I saw you come in with that Wolf. A shame what the Ruler is willing to do, who he’s willing to work with.”\n\nI snorted. “Yeah. Well. I’m on watch duty tonight.”\n\nThe woman took the hint, but not without flashing me a tantalizing, hungry grin. “A shame. You’re cute.”\n\nI almost turned away from the woman, but I noticed a hooded figure sitting alone, at the corner of the bar.\n\n“Here you are,” I heard the bartender say. “One shot of our finest. And here’s your change.”\n\nI thanked him and took both. I nearly asked him how someone dressed like a burglar managed to get into *No Rules*, but I figured I had enough on my plate.\n\nTo my relief, Kara was still at our table when I returned. “Here you are.”\n\nShe swallowed the golden liquid as quickly as I’d placed it in front of her. The Wolf let out a brief but obnoxious howl.\n\nI sat quietly, tapping my foot in lieu of closing her windpipe permanently.\n\nKara put a fist below her chin and examined me with those manic eyes. The swirls of rainbow colors dancing on her coat only made her look more unstable. “What’s it like to always do what you’re told?”\n\n“I protect Humanity.” I shrugged. “Can’t think of a higher purpose than that.” \\*And what’s your purpose, you empty, childish Wolf? \\*I thought.\n\n“Is that what you do. And who do you serve?”\n\n“Humanity.”\n\nKara laughed mockingly. “You really are a cute little cog. Who gives you your orders?”\n\nI frowned. “My Lieutenant.”\n\n“Yeah, yeah. Up the chain-of-command. Who do you *serve*, boy?”\n\n\\*I’m older than you, bitch. \\*“The Ruler.”\n\n“Mhm. Your tyrant. The one who doesn’t let you trade with other races without his permission. I don’t know much about you Humans, but I’ve learned that much from my father. That right?”\n\n“Tyrant? No.”\n\nKara licked her gums, and I saw with horror where her fangs exited her gums. “Barbaric is what I call it.”\n\n“The Ruler and his Assembly keep order, maintain peace throughout Polygon,” I answered defensively. “Without them, we’d be nothing. And without the Military that they fund, we’d be overrun by Creatures.”\n\n“I feel bad for you, Wyatt. The Great Builder has provided us—all of us—with so many gifts, yet you enslave yourself to another. Pathetic.”\n\n“I told you already,” I said with force. “We don’t have a ‘Great Builder’, whoever that is.”\n\nFor the first time, I saw sincerity in Kara’s eyes. “Not ‘*a* Great Builder’, sweet Solider. \\*The \\*Great Builder, Deliverer of Order, Constructor of Life, Builder of the Playground.”\n\n“Sounds like an impressive guy. Where’s he now?”\n\nKara shook her head. “Your eyes are closed, Soldier. Your mind is not your own, chained as it is to your Ruler. If you pray to Him, he answers. Listen carefully, and you can hear Him in the whispers of the wind. Look closely, and you can see him in the twinkle of the stars.” Her smile widened. “Love passionately, and you can feel Him in your blood.”\n\nKara sounded like she was quoting words that weren’t hers. “You keep telling me I’m just someone’s lapdog. But you’re the one talking nonsense. The Ruler is real. The Assembly is real.” I pointed to my star pin. “The Military’s real. Can you say the same about this Builder guy?”\n\n“There’s nothing real about your Ruler. You’re a slave. And you always will be.”\n\n“What about your Ruler?” I snapped angrily.\n\nKara laughed again. “We have leaders, not rulers.”\n\n“Are you going to keep playing games with me all night?” I pointed a finger in the girl’s face. “What do you want with me?”\n\nKara clicked her tongue mockingly and put her hands up. “So rude, Wyatt! Carol would be disappointed.”\n\nI grabbed her coat without thinking and pulled her scrawny frame towards me. “How do you know my mom’s name?”\n\n“Ah, there you are,” she whispered, and I could smell her alcohol-ridden breath. “Let me go, Wyatt. You never know who’s watching. Wouldn’t want to get you into trouble now.”\n\nI did, and I recomposed myself, tapping my foot faster than before. The rest of the bar scene melted away from my vision. All I could see was this drunken Wolf’s hairy face.\n\nAn annoying job, I could handle. But this was not that. Not anymore.\n\nThis bitch was threatening my family.\n\n“Oh Wyatt,” she continued, “you really ought to get a handle on that temper. Anger’s a bad look on you.”\n\n“We’re done here,” I said flatly, and rose to my feet. “I’m taking you back to your hotel.”\n\nKara rolled her eyes. “Sit down, Soldier. You were ordered to watch over me, right? Now, do as you were told.”\n\nMy legs wouldn’t move. My mouth opened and closed.\n\nI didn’t know what to do.\n\n“I wonder,” Kara purred, “if sweet little Amanda shares your aggression. I mean, she \\*is \\*your sister, after all. Or is she?”\n\nI was a caged beast, furious and helpless. I was frozen as petrified lava, eager to burn red and devour the enemy before me.\n\n“I still haven’t given you my gift, Wyatt. And you’re not looking so hot. Why don’t you take me back to my hotel?”\n\nI didn’t look back at her. I walked out of \\*No Rules \\*and assumed she followed.\n\nNo words were spoken during our trip back to her hotel. I would’ve been surprised at Kara’s reticence, but I was still overcome with fear, rage, and confusion.\n\n“Come up to my room,” Kara said as we approached the hotel.\n\nA young Military woman opened the front doors for us.\n\n“I don’t think so,” I muttered, still avoiding Kara’s eyes. “My job’s done.”\n\nAs I began to walk away, I heard her stupid, insane giggling from behind me. “No, it’s not. There were witnesses at the bar. You assaulted me. My dad’s meeting with your Assemblymen tomorrow to finalize their deal. You think your holy bosses would sacrifice this deal just to keep *you*? You’re nothing, Wyatt. Unimpressive. A lifeless cog in this machine you call Polygon. And of course, so very *alone*.”\n\nMy hands turned to fists. She knew so much. It terrified me.\n\nAnd the bitch had me.\n\nI turned around and silently followed her into the hotel lobby. Maybe the staff waved to us as we headed towards the elevators. I couldn’t focus on anything but the teenager leading me.\n\n“I’m on the top floor,” she said merrily as we entered the elevator. “Got my own room, where I can really let loose. It’s been a long day. Traveling is so stressful. Don’t you ever just want to just lose yourself?”\n\nHer room was the last in a long hallway. Kara took out a golden key from the pouch of her coat and unlocked her door. “After you,” she said.\n\nKara’s room was a mess. Broken bottles littered the wooden floor, and I saw more than one unseemly powder on top of her dresser. It smelled of alcohol and some kind of burn that I couldn’t place. As I followed her into the bedroom, I past a shattered sliding door that revealed a very unused bathroom.\n\nI stared at Kara’s bed as I heard her open a drawer. “Here you are, W—”\n\nI snapped my head, finally looking at Kara. Before she could come towards me, I took two strident steps in her direction and grabbed her skinny neck with both hands. Her whiskery beard proved no resistance to the pressure of my thumbs against her windpipe.\n\n“Come near my mother, my father, or my sister, and I will show you what this lonely Soldier has learned to do with a hammer,” I whispered, fire clipping my words. “If I so much as hear that you’ve been tiptoeing near them, I will end you.” I dragged her by the neck until she was pinned against her dresser. “I don’t care if you’re back in your home territory. I will find you and slaughter you like the animal that you are.”\n\nHer feet flailed helplessly in the air as I unconsciously lifted her above the ground. I didn’t stop squeezing. The bags under her eyes began to take on a purple hue.\n\nKara’s left hand tried to push me away to no avail. Then she raised her right hand, and I glanced at the envelope between her shaking fingers. My name was written on its front.\n\nA faint, distant sense of curiosity managed to penetrated through my more immediate ferocity. As it did, I knew that I had to release this thing. I let go of Kara’s neck, and she fell to the floor in a fit of coughs and confused cries.\n\nI picked up the envelope that she had dropped. Her handwriting was sloppy and lazy, but my name was definitely written on it.\n\nI looked down at Kara. She was struggling unsuccessfully to rise to her feet, surrounded by broken glass and stale puddles of alcohol. I’d honestly expected more wiseassery, but apparently I’d found the one way to shut her up.\n\nI left her hotel room to the sound of the Wolf’s suffering.\n\nI didn’t open the envelope immediately. I needed some time to gather myself.\n\nI ended up wandering the streets of the Capital aimlessly in a timeless haze. I had no idea when I finally reached the entrance of the hotel we Soldiers had been set up in. Still half a block away, I saw someone on guard at the top of the stairs that led to the hotel’s entrance.\n\nWhatever was in this envelope, I figured it would be smart to open it privately.\n\nI glanced behind both shoulders to make sure I was alone, and then took Kara’s gift out from my pocket. I swallowed as I opened the envelope and pulled out a written letter in the same loose handwriting that had scribbled my name on the envelope.\n\nI read the letter from beginning to end.", "timestamp": 1633463608, "digest": "HSFoRzq_d6ItvPyI7AZhsvDRisc8kbt6fHi6PqyqVos", "contributor": "0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC"}
{"id": "VwM96UfbfrEoup9A44Sw0s-Sgp0EAWEU9LAQnyTJEOs", "title": "Windfall: Chapter One", "body": "Chapter One\n\n*Six days earlier…*\n\n“You gonna eat that?”\n\nI looked up at Benjamin, who was staring eagerly at the untouched turkey leg on my plate. “Go for it, champ.”\n\nHe grabbed it with his bare hands and gnawed on the leg like a starved vulture. “God, that’s disgusting,” I muttered.\n\n“You really should slow down and learn some etiquette,” Aiden said, who was sitting to Benjamin’s right. “We’re lucky to be at such a formal occasion.”\n\nBenjamin tried speaking with his mouth full, but I interrupted. “Don’t, dude. You start spitting across the table, and they’ll definitely kick us out.”\n\nThe brute rolled his eyes but obliged. I shared a look with Aiden, and we shook our heads in unison.\n\nThe three of us sat at a roundtable by the hall’s back wall, having chosen one of the dozen or so that had been assigned to Soldiers. Some other rookies sat alongside us, but I think Benjamin’s savagery kept them from chatting us up.\n\nI scanned the room and guessed that there were around two-hundred people enjoying the buffet. Military members were easy to pick out, since they wore star-shaped pins on their otherwise formal attire. We were told not to wear our combat gear for the banquet, but that we were encouraged to bring a weapon or two.\n\nMy naked sledgehammer dangled from my belt.\n\n“I recognize some of the Philosophers here,” Aiden said. She nodded towards a table several rows closer to the room’s dais than we were. “See them? They write about the nature of laws.”\n\nI looked over at Aiden. She was pale, skinny, and her white-blonde hair somehow reminded me of dying grass. “Why would they be invited to this?”\n\nAiden smiled, her green eyes darting excitedly. “The Wolves make things that Humans could never dream to. I’m sure they’re interested.”\n\nI shrugged my shoulders so that my jacket fell back into place. It was a little big for me, but Mom tried her best. I hated dressing like this. If I wanted to dress up for work, I would’ve joined the ranks of Commerce. “Yeah, well, all that thinking won’t help if the Wolves decide the buffet isn’t cutting it.”\n\nBenjamin let loose a thunderous burp, which earned looks of horror by the other rookies at the table. “I’m with Wyatt. You can’t trust an animal.”\n\n“Didn’t some horde of Wolves try to raid Polygon just last week?” I added.\n\n“Yeah,” Aiden said diffidently, “but those were from the Wildlands. This is different.”\n\n“Uh-huh,” Benjamin muttered. “Don’t see any Humans living in the Wildlands.” He tapped Aiden’s nose. “Don’t be naïve, sweetie. It’ll get you killed.”\n\nAiden grabbed Benjamin’s finger and tossed it away. “Not all problems can be solved with a gun. Read a book, ogre.”\n\n“Books didn’t help me last month against those rhinos,” Benjamin retorted. “Wyatt was there, he’ll tell you. Wyatt?”\n\nI’d only been half-listening to my friends’ banter. My eyes were locked with a man walking towards our table. “What? Sure. Hey, I think Lieutenant Roderick is headed our way.”\n\nEveryone at the table straightened up at that, including me. I had more reason than the others—Roderick was \\*my \\*Lieutenant, my direct commander.\n\n“Hey,” he said when he reached me.\n\nI kept eye contact and prayed that I didn’t have food on the sides of my mouth. “Sir.”\n\n“Come find me after the ceremony. I have a job for you.”\n\nI suppressed the excitement and curiosity that threatened to leak through my face. “Yessir.”\n\nWith a nod, the strong-jawed Lieutenant walked away. The rest of the rookies at the table looked at me, but I ignored them. Once Roderick was out of earshot, I whispered to Benjamin and Aiden, “Guess I’m his favorite.”\n\nBenjamin snorted. “He probably wants you on cleaning duty.”\n\n“You don’t think an event like this is already covered by the Assembly?” I retorted. “No way. This’ll be something interesting.”\n\nThe background chatter of the room suddenly died. I looked towards the dais to see a bald, round man, dressed in an ocean-blue suit and white shirt, standing alone at its center. It was difficult to make out the pin on his jacket lapel, but I already knew what it was—a metallic square with three squiggly horizontal lines etched on its surface. The symbol of Humanity, of Polygon, of our leadership class.\n\nWe’d had the honor of meeting this man on our last day of training, when we were officially inaugurated into the Military. Clovis, the First Assemblyman, second in political authority only to the Ruler himself.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen!” Clovis said cheerfully into a small microphone that ran from his ear down to his mouth. “I thank you all for attending this most historic event. For thousands of years, we have lived our lives in Polygon as an isolated people. And we’ve been good at it. Our art flourishes.” He gestured at the right-hand wall, on which hung a large painting of hooded Philosophers buried in books. “Our men and women of Commerce ensure that our people’s needs are satisfied. Our Industry folk keep Polygon running without fail. And, of course, our Military keeps the peace, both within our walls and without them.”\n\n“He’s buttering up the crowd,” I muttered to my friends. “He knows working with Wolves is a tough sell.”\n\nAiden put a finger to her lips.\n\nBenjamin was right. I didn’t know how she made the cut.\n\n“But there is more to the world than Polygon. Many of you may not know this, but the Wolves have engineered some of the most astonishing creations I have ever seen. I’ve been there myself. Their world is one of gears and chemicals and things as magical as Godlets themselves. And while I’m proud of what Humankind has achieved, we can benefit from those on the other side of the continent.\n\n“The last trade with Wolves that the Assembly approved of was over thirty years ago. Many in this room will not have remembered it, and not only because there are so many young faces in attendance. It hardly lasted more than a week. Complications…arose.” The First Assemblyman clasped his hands together and smiled devilishly, as if he were about to land a punchline. “But failures of the past do not compel us to relinquish possibilities of the future. With *The Principles of Earth and Blood*, we are boundless.”\n\nHe paused, and everyone clapped to fill the brief silence.\n\n“Now, please welcome our guest of honor as he joins me. Bogg is a renowned mogul at the Builder’s Mountains. He has brought his daughter, Kara, along with him. A round of applause, please!”\n\nWhile we obliged his request, two figures entered the dais from behind its back curtain and stood by Clovis. Both wore elegant white outfits that I nearly mistook for bathrobes, but the fabric was far finer than anything I’d wear on a lazy morning, and their clothes shone as brightly as snow under the sun. Odder than their stylistic choice was that the clothing was literally *moving*—their tops gently rippled from left to right, as if dozens of tiny ocean waves were rolling underneath in rapid, successive, rhythmic fashion.\n\nBoth of them wore jewelry from head to toe, each ornament cut from a different gem. Their dangling, blood-red earrings and their sparkling, gray bracelets rotated in perfect harmony with the mechanical dance of their robes. More than half of their fingers were decorated with gemstone rings. Those, at least, stood still.\n\nTheir faces…my hand instinctively went to my hammer as I took them in, man and girl. Both were utterly covered in what looked like billions of thin whiskers. It was almost disgusting to look at. The larger man’s hair was mostly dark gray with a few dashes of white interspersed from his dome to his mane. The girl’s hair was similar in character, but it was the yellow-green of spring leaves.\n\n*She-Wolves have beards. Noted.*\n\nTheir fangs extended down what I guessed was past their chins, but they were too hairy—or too whiskery—to tell. While the man-Wolf was definitely lean for his size, the girl was definitely too skinny to be healthy. Even with all of that hair, I could see her sunken cheeks.\n\nAs our applause died down, the taller of the pair offered a deep, long bow. “Hello to you all,” he boomed in a deep, confident voice. “My daughter and I thank you for your hospitality. I’ve already met some of you when we landed earlier today. My name is Bogg, and this is Kara.”\n\nThe girl waved to the crowd with both hands, as if trying to make a joke. She stumbled forward, and for a second, I thought she’d trip over her feet.\n\nBogg’s gaze never left us, and he continued unabated. “My team and I have been in communication with Clovis and his cohort for years, ironing out the details of this deal. The Great Builder has granted all of us most fortuitous circumstances. You see, I have learned that underneath Polygon may rest undiscovered veins of metals and other valuable materials. If I understand correctly, you all use much of this metal for what you call ‘money’. But we don’t have this ‘money’ in the Builder’s Mountains. We employ the Great Builder’s seeds towards far more creative ends. With his gifts, we fertilize the world.”\n\nI frowned. *Was that a dig at us?*\n\nI noticed other faces turn sour, too.\n\nBut Bogg either didn’t notice, or he didn’t care. “We have had toys that sniff out the earth’s riches long before I came into contact with your people. We call them ‘metal detectors’. With knowledge of how Polygon runs, my team created a specialized device just for you, your own artificial bug. But I digress. I won’t bore you with details here, nor with a demonstration. Roderick and the rest of your Assembly have already seen its efficacy.\n\n“Your men of Industry will receive shipments of my toys. It has been agreed upon that I will receive some modest fraction of any metals that my bugs discover for you.” Bogg paused. “This is—”\n\nKara took a wobbly step forward, and an explosion of bile and chunks of who-knows-what rocketed from her mouth.\n\nBenjamin yelled profanity, but it was drowned out by the hundred other yells of shock. I looked wide-eyed towards my friends. “She’s drunk,” I muttered. “Guess booze hits Wolves the same way it hits us.”\n\n“Okay, okay!” Clovis shouted, as Bogg grabbed his daughter by the arm and quickly fell back behind the curtain from which they came. “I’m terribly sorry, friends. Kara must be unwell. In any case, I thank you all for attending once again. Have a good night, everyone.”\n\nPeople immediately began shuffling out of the hall. I saw staff who had been silently standing against the walls begin to clean up the place, including the vomit on the dais.\n\n“That was weird,” Aiden said as the three of us rose to our feet.\n\n“Yep,” Benjamin muttered. “This guy’s supposed to be our friend, or something? He brought his drunk daughter to his welcome ceremony. He’s spitting in our faces.”\n\n“No,” Aiden responded. “I mean, I’ve read about the Wolves. They normally raise their children communally. It’s odd that Bogg has a daughter of his own at all.”\n\n“Guess your books don’t have all the answers, after all,” Benjamin teased.\n\n“I *did* know that Wolves don’t have a currency,” Aiden protested.\n\nI put my fist out. “Much as I’d love to stick around, I’m gonna find Lieutenant Roderick. I’ll see you back at the hotel.”\n\nMy friends took turns bumping my fist, and I headed towards the table I had seen Roderick sitting at. When I turned his way, I saw that everyone at his table had already left, except him.\n\nHe was waiting for me.\n\n“Uh, sir,” I said as I approached his backside. “You wanted to see me?”\n\nRoderick turned his head but remained seated and utterly still. “Sit for a second, Wyatt.”\n\nI did, and I turned my chair so that we were face-to-face. “What can I do for you?”\n\nThe Lieutenant’s dimples showed as he held back a grin. “Some ceremony, eh?”\n\n“Seems like the Assembly will approve the deal.”\n\nRoderick laughed. “Relax, Wyatt. It’s just you and me here.” Now his face did break out in a flashy smile. “What do you really think?”\n\n“I, um…” I broke eye contact with my commander. “Sorry, I don’t know what to say, sir.”\n\n“Hey, kid, listen to me. Look at me. You’re, what, nineteen-years-old? You’ve been in the Military for less than a year. I’ve seen you in training. In action. You’ve got more drive than most rookies I’ve come across.”\n\nI looked back at Roderick and did my best to suppress the elation that wanted to leap out of my throat. “Really?”\n\nRoderick winked at me and nodded. “Between you and me. You’re passionate about your job. How long have you wanted to join the Military?”\n\n“I never considered another profession, sir.”\n\n“Figured as much. You could go a long way, kid. I see it. And I’m in your camp. Know that.”\n\n“I appreciate that. I…don’t know what to say.”\n\nHis playful expression again broke out in a chuckle. “You said that already. Now, I ask again: what did you think of that ceremony?”\n\n“Well…I don’t understand why Bogg would bring his daughter out if she’s such a liability.”\n\nRoderick nodded. “Go on.”\n\n“I don’t know what’s going on with—what was her name, Kara? If Bogg wanted to earn our trust or respect, why would he have brought his drunk daughter onto the dais? Unless his judgment is that poor, in which case we shouldn’t be trading with him in the first place. Or maybe he did it on purpose, to spit in our face. It’s dicey enough working with any Wolf, let alone a stupid or malevolent one.”\n\n“Why is that?”\n\nMy nerves had faded away, and I leaned closer towards my Lieutenant. “Humans should stick to our own. Things are good enough at Polygon. Clovis said it himself. Why entangle ourselves with another race?” I shook my head. “They’re not worth it.”\n\n“There it is,” Roderick said approvingly. “I might agree with you, kid. But you know, maybe Bogg’s technology will land us gold. More money is never a bad thing. I don’t know, honestly. I hadn’t heard about the details until his speech.”\n\n“He was mocking us,” I snapped. “He called his own technology ‘toys’ several times. Like we’re just receiving the bottom of the barrel. Screw him and his drunk daughter.”\n\n“Okay, okay!” Roderick held his hands up teasingly. “I hear you. I don’t like working with them, either.” He shrugged his shoulders. “But you’re wrong about one thing, Wyatt. Things can \\*always \\*get better.”\n\n“Yeah well,” I muttered. “I guess we’ll see.”\n\n“And speaking of his ‘drunk daughter’, as you called her. That’s why I wanted to talk to you.”\n\nI sat back in my chair. “Oh?”\n\nRoderick cocked his head and looked vaguely puzzled. “You were in attendance when their ship landed earlier today. I know the two of them exited very quickly and were escorted away, but did you by any chance make eye contact with Kara?”\n\nI pursed my lips. “Not at all. To be totally honest, I barely looked at them.”\n\n“Not curious to see what a Wolf looked like? I know you hadn’t seen one yet, out in the Wildlands.”\n\n“Nope. Not at all. They’re not us.”\n\nRoderick snorted. “Fair enough. And you’ve been in my sights for the last few hours. You couldn’t have interacted with her since then.”\n\n“Sir, what’s this about?”\n\n“She wants a night out on the town. Apparently she wants to check out the Capital’s bar scene. From what I’m told, she requested you as her tour guide.”\n\nI frowned. “What? That’s my task?”\n\nRoderick nodded. “Yeah. Not the sexiest order I’ll give you, but there it is. They’re our guests, so it’s not really our call.”\n\n“No, I get that. Bogg’s going to let her out after that debacle? How old is she, anyway?”\n\n“I don’t know. Couple years younger than you, I guess, though the beard makes it hard to tell.”\n\nI ran a hand through my hair, unsure how to react. “I…don’t like this. I don’t want to talk to these Wolves. I definitely don’t want to babysit some drunk.”\n\n“I get it. Think of it as security service. I don’t know how these Wolves choose to live, and I certainly wouldn’t let my kid out after humiliating me. Who knows, maybe that’s going to be the case. Before the ceremony, my superior had told Bogg that you’d meet her outside her hotel at nine p.m. Maybe she won’t show. But if she does, you’re there to protect her.”\n\nI grinned at my Lieutenant. “I do like that better than babysitting.”\n\nHe lightly punched me in the arm. “There you go. Oh, and don’t change your clothes. Let’s keep a professional face.”\n\n“Definitely.”\n\n“Do you know where \\*No Rules \\*is? It’s a high-end bar just a few blocks from where Kara and Bogg are staying.”\n\nI nodded. “Yeah. I’ve never gone in, though. Last time I was in the Capital was when we passed our training. My friends and I celebrated in the area.”\n\n“I’m sure you did. Here.”\n\nRoderick pulled out something from his jacket pocket and handed me half a dozen heavy golden coins. I looked at them and saw the same insignia inscribed on them that was on Clovis’ pin. I whistled. “This isn’t your money, is it?”\n\n“Of course not. I like you, but not that much. The Assembly’s covering whatever Kara wants tonight.”\n\n“I won’t drink,” I assured him.\n\nHe smiled proudly at me. “I know you won’t. Look, I know it won’t be the most fun job, but I’ll make sure people know you did it well.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. Do you know why she chose me?”\n\nRoderick rose to his feet, and I followed suit. He extended a rough, calloused hand to me. I met his grip. “You have an hour to yourself before you’re on duty. I have no idea why she insisted on you, but you can ask her. Might be a good way to bypass small talk, anyway. Good luck, Wyatt. I’ll see you in the morning.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. For everything. I won’t let you down.”\n\nWith one last charming grin, my commander walked away and left the banquet hall.\n\nI looked around and realized that no one was left but the cleaning crew and me. I closed my eyes and took a breath.\n\n*One night. One Wolf.

{"id": "0tjRytYIITWwG8CoRHdqphbjZjXy7HQIHnG6dwSGlgk", "title": "Chapter One: Charlie Storm", "body": "Charlie Storm didn’t know today would be his last among friends and family. Getting ready for school in the morning, Charlie went about the same routine as he did every day: he scoured his closet for his cleanest and freshest smelling clothes, threw them on, then ran to the kitchen, where he stuffed his mouth with a piece of peanut-butter smeared toast, all while listening to his favourite music—bagpipes—and humming along as best he could, which, he would be the first to tell you, was not very good.\n\nHe left his home in a flurry and began sprinting down the street toward the bus-stop, groaning as he glanced at the plain-black watch attached to his wrist. He’d be late again, and Mr. Snyder, his insufferable homeroom and math teacher, would surely have him in detention after class—most likely sat in the desk specially set aside for the “troublesome child.” Charlie went to detention so much he considered it just another class to get through before the school-day was done.\n\nSoot quickly charred Charlie’s pants as he ran and kicked up dust from the unpaved road. The town in which Charlie lived lay hidden in the mountains on the west coast of Canada, among the remnants of mining operations that had helped to build the great railroad spread\n\n out across the land, and the town was named accordingly: Black Rock. To clear a path for the railroad, miners had used tons upon tons of dynamite to blast the mountain to pieces. The resulting char was forever ingrained into the remaining stone.\n\nBlack Rock was no longer useful for any great projects or plans, but merely existed—and within it, the people, too, merely existed.\n\nThe lack of adventure and excitement was excruciating for Charlie, and his troublesome ways were merely a product of his attempt to spice up his life. He didn’t fit in with the normal teenagers or with their ideas of fun. He couldn’t play hockey very well and thus couldn’t join the only sports team in town, nor did he enjoy watching, and so he didn’t go cheer on the others. Charlie wouldn’t be caught with that crowd, anyway.\n\nInstead, Charlie liked experimenting with limits: How high could he climb before the air became too thin or he became too cold? How often could he skip school before someone noticed and got him in trouble for it? How many times could he spray-paint green Mr. Snyder’s prized poodle?\n\nThese were of course the simplest and least exciting of Charlie’s tests. Charlie’s affinity for pushing limits coincided nicely with his love for science, and he often spent his hours playing with chemistry sets or building things he learned about in physics books. Just last week he had taken a coil of copper and wrapped it around a piece of metal, attaching one end to a set of batteries. The resulting solenoid had proved destructive when he had broken one of his mother’s paintings with a golf ball he had fired through the house. Even now, in his pocket he felt one of the black powders he had found on one of his treks into the mountains and secreted away. \n\nCharlie’s parents discouraged his pursuits but did little to stop them altogether. But if any of the other adults in town ever caught wind of what he played around with, he was sure he’d have to find new hobbies.\n\n“Let’s go, let’s go! Sick of waiting for you, Mr. Storm. Move it!”\n\nA woman with red hair and cracked skin yelled at him as he scrambled the last few feet to the bus, the big yellow brick—the cheesewagon—herding all of the town’s highschoolers and snagged a seat at the front. It was only one of a few seats left unoccupied, as the gangs and groupies had taken up everything in the back and middle.\n\n“Late again, Chucky? Haven’t you learned to use that hideous thing strapped to your wrist?” A hawkish-looking girl yelled at him from the back of the bus. She was surrounded by a gaggle of wide-eyed followers hanging to her every word. “What is it that you’re wearing, anyway? If you’re going to keep us waiting you might as well have the decency to spare our eyesight.” Raucous laughter erupted from the sitting circle of girls, cheering at Cindy Martin’s slight. She was the queen-bee, and her sycophants were her mindless workers. She even looked the part today, adorned in a bright yellow sundress with black trim and leathery boots. A white orchid poked out from her immaculately crafted hair, which fell around her face perfectly.\n\nThe scene made Charlie want to throw up in his mouth, but that would just give her more ammunition. Instead, he just ignored her and stared out the window.  \n\nThe cheesewagon made its way around town, swerving through winding streets carved into the mountainside, bumping over asphalt not paved for many years, and picking up somber-looking kids wherever it went. School was never a popular destination for those who would rather sleep and play video games, but life to a 15-year-old was hardly fair. Charlie daydreamed about what he might get up to this afternoon once the final bell had rung—likely something involving black powder—while taking in beautiful glacier-tipped skies. A lone falcon soared through the air, seeming to follow the path of the bus, and every-so-often flapped its gigantic wings to continue its forward motion.\n\nThe bus finally arrived at his school. It was not that impressive, really. The front entrance stuck out from the rest of the building, which had the look of a castle made of Lego; the squared lines and turns in the brick could have been designed by a child, and the building’s reddish colour did nothing to add to the charm. The bus driver, an ancient man with a grizzled beard and wrinkled hands, pushed the level to the bus’s front door. It made a small hiss as it folded open, beckoning to the stink of teenagers to flow out. The driver inhaled deep and slow as if to emphasize this cleansing. “Out you go, brats!”\n\nStudents immediately stood up and started yelling conversations, discussing homework, rumours, sports, and parties. They climbed over seats and pushed each other to the side, wrestling towards the exit. Testosterone was fierce in Black Rock. The dullness of life was tempered only by an inevitable passion to compete with each other.\n\nCharlie just kept sitting in his seat and staring out the window. The falcon that had flown along with the bus now sat perched atop the school’s flagpole, which rose high from the entrance to the school. A large flag bearing the mighty maple leaf flapped in a strong wind, slightly in conflict with the falcon perched so majestically and so statuesque in the sun. Charlie looked at the falcon with a new interest; he could have sworn it was looking straight back at him. For a moment, he felt unnerved and uncomfortable, but he quickly dismissed the feelings. He always felt that way. He just didn’t fit in.\n\nCharlie was last off the bus, as usual. He pulled his backpack tight and picked at peanut butter caught in his teeth. Satisfied, he moped his way to his homeroom class, careful to avoid any other school figureheads like Cindy Martin. He wasn’t afraid of confrontation or any unfortunate run-ins, but he definitely preferred to avoid them. The last time his temper flared in the face of an aggressor, his punishment had been severe—Mr. Synder had said it “fit the crime,” though Charlie hardly believed scrubbing toilets in the hockey team’s dressing room was proportional to breaking Josh Tennenbaums’ prized stick—even if Josh was the captain of the team and “number one in the hearts of all Black Rockers.”\n\nMr. Snyder was already calling attendance when Charlie entered the classroom, and made very sure to slow his words and gaze at Charlie as he took his desk. Charlie wasn’t late, and so Mr. Snyder couldn’t technically punish him, but Charlie knew a technicality wouldn’t stop the vile teacher from attempting to make Charlie’s life miserable. Mr. Snyder proved him right.\n\n“Ah, Mr. Storm. Please turn in your assignment right away. Placing it in this box shall do.” Mr. Synder pointed to a flat cardboard box sitting on the table in front of him. It looked like it had previously contained a case of soda or cheap beer. Classy.\n\n“What assignment are you talking about? There’s nothing due for homeroom, and I know you know that.” Charlie’s indignant tone was quite clear.  While he didn’t have any problems confronting Mr. Snyder, Charlie had an issue with tact—as in he had none. Mr. Snyder smirked in response,\n\n“Honestly, Mr. Storm, I don’t know how you made it this far in your academic career. You clearly cannot follow instructions. Yesterday your entire class was given a problem set on linear algebra to be turned in to me today. Your classmates have not forgotten, Storm.” Mr. Snyder snatched the box and tilted it forward, demonstrating the stack of papers already lining the stained bottom.\n\nCharlie felt a fury rise up in him,\n\n“This is homeroom, Snyder, not math class. I don’t have to turn in anything to you right now. You’ll have to try harder than that.” A hush fell over the room. While the other students had seen Charlie argue with Mr. Snyder before, he might have crossed the line this time by not addressing his teacher properly or professionally. \n\nMr. Snyder responded in barely a whisper, clipping his words short and staring at Charlie with venom in dull grey eyes.\n\n“You have no respect, Mr. Storm, for your elders or for your betters. You are but a snivelling child, crying how the world isn’t fair. I am your teacher and I want your assignment. If you do not have your assignment to give me, Mr. Storm, then I will add to the detention and punishment you have just earned by way of your insolence. Do you understand me? Actually, it doesn’t matter if you do or you don’t. You will leave this classroom—immediately. You will go to my office and to the punishment desk there within. I assume you remember where that is? Go. Now.”   \n\nWith that, the overweight and balding teacher waved his hand at Charlie and turned back to his attendance sheet, resuming his mundane recital of those supposed to be present. Charlie stood in stunned silence for several moments, trying to process the events that had just transpired. He hadn’t even made it past  the first bell before being hit with the cruel discipline at Black Rock High—just another cause for him to become more isolated from anything resembling a normal adolescence. \n\nHe stood abruptly, scraping the legs of his chair against concrete floors, and stomped out of the room, knocking over a stack of loose-leaf paper with this backpack as he went. The paper fell to the ground and slipped across the classroom, swishing as it went. Mr. Snyder ignored it and kept his face steady as a stone, eyes forward and attention focused. Charlie could never win the war with him.\n\nThe hallways of the school were empty as he made his way toward the north corridor, where the teacher’s offices resided. Here, lockers didn’t crash and bang close, murmuring of cliques didn’t assault his ears, and shrill voices of hallway monitors didn’t drown out his thoughts. Instead, an eerie silence followed him and his lonely footsteps.\n\nThe light seemed to dim as he moved further and further away from his homeroom, and the halls seemed to close around him. It made him claustrophobic, so he ran to one of the large windows lining the hallway. He unlatched it and pushed it up, taking a large breath of chilly air as it forced its way through the opening. Charlie closed his eyes for a second and let the rays of the sun pour down on his face, embracing a moment of serenity he could not find in this place anywhere else. How he wished to be free of Black Rock.  \n\nCharlie opened his eyes, then suddenly yelped, startled by a shadow splaying across the courtyard in front of him. The shadow was large, about ten feet from side to side, and had sharp edges and prongs poking out from weird angles.\n\nThe shadow moved, extending itself vertically in a ruffle of lines. Charlie stuck his head out the window and peered left towards the sun, trying to spot the figure responsible for the darkness, but all he could see was a bird sitting on an eave of the school.\n\nNo, not a bird—it was a falcon. The same falcon that had chased his bus and sat atop the flagpole.\n\n It sat there unmoving and stared at him. Charlie pulled his head back inside and looked up and down the hallways. He saw no one. All was still. An eerie sensation caused his skin to prickle. The shadow seemed to grow larger on the schools’ lawn.\n\nCharlie turned away from the window and shook his head, eager to forget the experience. He resumed his march towards Snyder’s office. At the end of the corridor, something flicked past his vision and moved quickly out of sight. Charlie was scared now, turning his head left and right as he hurried his steps. The eerie silence of before magnified, and his perceptions narrowed. It was as if there were no living creature around for miles and miles, and he was left alone in a world abandoned.\n\n*Am I going crazy*, Charlie wondered? He had just been in a classroom full of disgusting teenagers, smelling awful and picking at themselves, learning to live with their changing bodies and hormones. He was no more alone than any of them. But he couldn’t explain his feeling that something was terribly wrong.\n\nTrue to his nature, though, Charlie ventured forward, testing his limits. He didn’t care that he couldn’t hear anyone. He didn’t care that everything seemed darker and smaller, or that something big had just rushed past the end of the corridor. He didn’t care that a falcon was following him. He didn’t care that Snyder would not be happy to discover he was not waiting for him in his office, ready for another serving of discipline. Though he was afraid, Charlie was excited. Something at last was happening to him that merited his attention.\n\nCharlie pulled from his backpack a flashlight, flicked it on, and crept forward, making sure to stick close to the lockers against the walls. A few times as he progressed, his bag snagged onto a lock or a piece of metal sticking out, causing him to curse under his breath. Every sound now echoed and crashed in his ears.\n\nThe end of the corridor approached now, and Charlie could now make out the sound of rustling of fabric coming from behind the corner. He crouched low with his back to the wall, his backpack pressing into him so that he wasn’t exactly flush. He flicked off his flashlight and sat in what was now utter darkness. All the lights in the school had extinguished themselves, as if they had winked out of existence. As slowly and quietly as he could, Charlie peeked his head around the corner. He wasn’t prepared.\n\nLarge gloved hands swooped down and grabbed him by the collar and yanked him standing, then quickly wrapped a piece of cloth around his mouth. Charlie bit his lip, and a metallic tasting trickle of blood ran down the inside of his cheek. He was slammed back against the wall and held there in place. Charlie couldn’t see what was restraining him, but his attacker now stood several paces from him and loomed large in the dark.\n\nThe attacker made a swift movement and Charlie flinched, expecting to be hit; instead, he heard the striking of a match. A blue flame erupted in front of him, lighting his surroundings in an eerie haze.\n\nHis attacker did not look right. He, if it could be called that, stood seven feet tall at least, and was draped in a silver cloak. The hands that cradled the blue flame were wrapped in a black fabric of some kind, seamless and strong. The attacker’s face reflected the flame sharply, for his facial structure was very boney, and the skin sat taught over them. A square jaw protruded from under pursed lips, and the man appeared to have no hair on his face whatsoever.\n\nNone of these features were as weird, though, as the eyes. Charlie could only describe them as milky white and swirling, constantly in motion. The attacker peered at Charlie, unblinking, taking in the boy with an almost insatiable curiosity. \n\nCharlie could not tell if the man meant him harm—or, at least any more that he had already caused—or if he simply wanted to ask him a question. The moment lingered for what seemed like an age. Charlie realized he was the only one breathing. His attacker, the man with the milky white eyes and silver cloak, just stood in place as if a statue. Charlie struggled to free himself from the wall, but he simply could not move. Finally, the man spoke.\n\n“You are the first.” That was all he said. Charlie blinked, dumbstruck, and just looked back at the man. It made no sense. Charlie tried to speak and found this time he was able.\n\n“What do you mean I’m the first? Who the hell are you? Why did you attack me? Why can’t I move? Why is it so quiet? Where is everyone? How did it get so dark? What the hell?” The questions escaped Charlie’s lips in a matter of seconds, running together to form one long sound. He doubted this bizarre-looking man would answer his questions, if he had managed to understand them.\n\n“Do you answer the call, Invoker?”\n\n*Ok, I need to get out of here*, thought Charlie. Drug addicts did not frequent Black Rock very often, as there was no real reason to supply such a boring city. Everyone who lived here descended from mining families or academics, and everyone here knew each other.  No one dealt drugs and no one used. So why was there a tweaked-out freak now in Charlie’s school, and why was he calling Charlie the first and Invoker?\n\n“Are you going to hurt me?” Charlie asked in a very matter-of-fact manner.  He tried to not make any emotional pleas or appeal to any sense of reason. Only someone clearly out of his or her mind would dress up in a silver robe, wax their body clean of any hair, and do something funky to their eyes. The man’s response to Charlie was to simply ask his question once more,\n\n“Do you answer the call, Invoker?” This time he asked more forcefully.  Charlie thought he detected a pang of desperation in the words. So weird.\n\n“Yeah, sure. Whatever you say, guy. Just let me go.” The silver-robed, milky-eyed attacker closed his eyes and smiled. He stood for a moment, not breathing, not moving, and just smiling in place with his eyes closed. The scene reminded Charlie of standing in front of a great marble-fountain statue at night.\n\nSuddenly, without hesitation, the man jolted his eyes open and punched Charlie in the face. Blood spurted from his nose. \n\n“Your blood has now been spilled, Invoker. The call has been answered.” Whatever force was restraining Charlie vanished, and he collapsed to the floor and cupped his nose. It hurt more than he remembered, having been the recipient of blows to the face before, and the blood ran sticky through his fingers. But as painful as it was, he didn’t think it was broken. He knew that pain too well.\n\nHe took a few minutes plugging his nose with tissue from his backpack, and slowly got to his knees. The light had restored itself in the hallways of his school, and the corridors were now packed with students staring at him and with looks of confusion and bewilderment. Some pointed and laughed. Most had mouths agape and dared not speak a word. Mr. Snyder stood at the forefront of the crowd of onlookers, arms crossed and great belly drooping over his belt, a smirk of satisfaction on his ugly face.\n\n“Fighting invisible people, Mr. Storm? Accidentally hit yourself in the face? I hope that doesn’t hurt too much, and I hope your nose stops bleeding. Wouldn’t want you messing up my furniture, would I. Get a move on, boy. Now.”\n\nCharlie scowled and got to his feet. He didn’t know what had just happened to him, but it seemed as if it had all been in his mind. Snyder had implied he had been fighting with invisible people. Charlie didn’t think he could live that down.\n\nHe dragged himself to Snyder’s office and plopped down into the hard, wooden chair he frequented so often. Waiting for Snyder to return and no doubt make his life more miserable than it already was at that moment, Charlie couldn’t help but notice the falcon sitting on Snyder’s windowsill, unmoving, eyes fixed.", "timestamp": 1633462570, "digest": "nwE2nasv5yNSS40gu2gMgCNXw2BkQc88e3p6nJD0EiQ", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "11zHsu69Gc7pbNZt1vjl-mukkrVRFpZU64D3tt5m8yk", "title": "Chapter One: Vapor", "body": "*Shit.*\n\nI yanked my finger away from the spiral groove I’d been tracing in an oak table. It had been carved with some dull blade who knows how long ago. The table looked ancient—nothing more than rotting planks of wood strapped together by rusted iron bands—except for the smoke-filled glass protruding from its centre.\n\nWith clenched teeth I snagged the splinter sticking out of my skin, then shook the pain out and winced. An orb of translucent metal swung back and forth in the draft of night air that seeped into the pub through cracked walls and thin windows. Fluorescent light flickered inside. It was Colonist tech—probably third gen. I pulled my cloak tighter, sheltering against the brisk evening. The chill added to my irritation; the struggle taking place in front of me was taking too long. \n\n“Did I forget to mention it’s your turn?” I asked with bite.\n\nMy opponent didn’t even pretend to notice me. A heavy sigh escaped my lips and I leaned back in my rickety chair. My fingers wandered back to the groove. I didn’t know what else to do with myself, so I just held my breath and stared across the table and continued tracing, forcing thoughts out of my head. I tried not to drive myself into a fury as boredom set in and dulled my senses. I closed my eyes. This was always the worst part.\n\n“So, who you for?” I asked.\n\nSilence. The hulking figure sitting on the other side of the table continued to ignore me, unwilling to break his concentration.\n\n“I’m guessing the Mothers, right?” I continued. “Yeah, that’s gotta be it. Those robes give you away. They’re too clean—ain’t no soot on them—and I see too much red.” \n\nThat earned a glance up at me and away from the arena.\n\n“Hah, I knew it. See a lot of shit doing what I do—lotta people, and the things that drive them.”\n\n“You talk a lot.” The response was more rumble than speech, and it was telling. On the next flicker of light from the swaying orb, I looked closer at my opponent’s hood and saw pointed protrusions from where ears should have been.\n\n*Fuck.*\n\nMy opponent was Shek—don’t know how I missed it. These bastards were a plague on the Saved World, but they mostly stuck to the Last City with the cartels. What the hell was it doing out here? \n\n“Sorry—old habits.” I said. “I’m on the road so much and I’ve only got Blink to talk to.”\n\nAt the sound of his name, my Whippet raised his head and perked his ears. He leered at me, unblinking and dutifully awaited orders. Good dog, that one. He was one of a kind, a relic, and had been expensive as hell. I told him to go back to sleep, so he did.\n\nI noticed the Shek staring at my dog. The bristles beneath the Shek’s cloak weren’t visible, but I knew they’d be standing on end—razor sharp spikes prickling out of its spine.\n\n“Don’t worry. I think you can take him.” I smiled.\n\nThe Shek shot his blood red eyes at me before returning his attention to the game.\n\n“You been towing for the Mothers for long, Shek?”\n\nI needed answers. It was strange to see a Shek in these parts—stranger still to see someone wearing cartel colours. It bugged me.\n\nThe Shek finally rumbled a response: “They pay well.”\n\nAh, there it is. This Shek was here for me. I should have known I’d be found eventually.\n\n“Oh, I’ve no doubt. Let me guess: bounty hunter?” I spoke loud enough for all to hear.\n\nImmediate tension flooded the pub and drowned its patrons. A dozen other conversations hushed. Drinks stopped sloshing on the floor and were set down on tables. Hazy eyes clouded by ale became refocused, all pointing our way.\n\nThe Shek didn’t react. It was all the answer I needed.\n\n“Gotcha.”\n\nThe Shek’s eyes burned beneath its hood and an even deeper rumble shook from within. It was laughing. “We have you.”\n\nThe corners of my mouth turned up. “Is that right?”\n\nThe Shek didn’t answer. Instead, it finally decided on its play and hunched closer to the table. Wisps of light danced out of its outstretched fingers and converged between clawed hands now sticking out from its robes. The light swirled into it coalesced into a pulsing ball of light. The ball grew and intensified, and when it seemed as though it would hit a critical mass and explode, consuming the pub and everyone inside, it suddenly went completely still and assumed a form of solid, blue incandescence.\n\nThe form was a medieval warrior dragging a comically-large axe behind it. Sparks shot up from where the axe raked against the table as it made its way into the middle of the arena.\n\nI barely contained explosive laughter and looked at the snarling bounty-hunter.\n\n“Seriously? It took you half an hour to do that?”\n\nThe Shek’s fangs glistened and its eyes burned hotter, but it stayed still. “Your words will not save you.”\n\n“Can I ask you something? How much are the Mothers paying to take me down? I’m curious. Last week I was way up north in and heard something about what the Fathers were offering, and, frankly, I was shocked. There’s no way the Mothers would pay that well—are they?”\n\nThe Shek shook off my question. “Time to lose.”\n\nI decided I’d had enough. “No, I don’t think so.”\n\nI hunched forward and examined the game state. Several red, ephemeral figures were spread out in the large and hollow sphere embedded in the middle of the oak table. The forms inside were basic cylinders and took no other shape. They were pitifully small and not at all intimidating compared to the bounty hunter’s blue axe-man—by design.\n\nI chuckled and wondered how long it would take these roaming mercenaries to figure out the system I had conjured years ago while huddled in the corner of an alley in some broken town, sheltering myself from unnatural rain. It had just come to me, and right there, in the pouring wet and filth, I had worked out an idea in my head. Red light had sparked between my fingers and danced in the rain. I must have looked like a homeless lunatic driven mad trying to conquer the secrets of Vapor, as most did in these forsaken times.\n\nI looked up at the Shek and stretched out my hand, a gesture of civility.\n\nIt didn’t understand. “What is that?”\n\nI was offering him a way out. It was the decent thing to do, I guess, and I wasn’t sure why I kept putting a draw out there for lesser challengers, game after game after game. Maybe it was just my dumb luck that no one had ever accepted.\n\nThe bounty hunter rumbled and bristled, ready to seize its prey. Then it shook its head and snapped its jaws.\n\n“If you insist,” I said, turning back to the game and giving the closing some final thoughts. It would be closer than I liked, but I was confident. And tonight, I was trying something new.\n\nMy hands began to do their work and a familiar hum filled the air. My face glowed red behind my own ball of energy. At the point the humming reached its crescendo, no similar axe-wielding form emerged. Instead, twin beams drifted forward like grasping hands. They worked their way across the table, slowly, and entered the hollow sphere, heading straight for my little cylinders.\n\nThe Shek watched, confused. Throughout the evening I had witnessed the Shek’s tactics. They had been pathetically basic and straightforward. Most played like this. It was a product of battling in seedy pubs on the outskirts of civilization for scraps from the warring factions’ tables: Mothers, Fathers, or Unknown...it didn’t matter. They all went after the same thing the same way.\n\nMy new gameplay was getting attention, and the Shek wasn’t the only dumbfounded person in this shithole. Drunken observers had inched closer and closer until they were standing in a circle around the table, taking in something they’d never seen before\n\nAll hell broke loose when the twin beams hit the cylinders. The beams, previously slow, accelerated to incredible speeds upon first contact. They streaked between each cylinder, clockwise, forming a solid ring of light around the bounty-hunter’s blue avatar. The opponent’s axe was woefully ineffective as it swung around and around trying to chop the energy field. It was painfully clear that the Shek’s axe-man was doomed. The solid ring of light was constricting and would soon consume the figure.\n\nAt the last moment, the ring of light pulsed outwards and cascaded through the pub. For a brief instant, I could see every crack in every wall and all the insects scurrying to find dark shelter. I could see the awestruck faces of the toothless villagers and the padded bras hiding beneath the serving girl’s chests. Most importantly, I could see the anger roiling on the scaled face of the Shek sitting across from me.\n\nIt was over in less than a second after the twin beams had hit the cylinders. A chain reaction of energy spun exponentially until it unleashed a tidal wave of searing light that melted the blue axe-man into oblivion. The hollow sphere powered down, indicating the end of the match. I had won—again.\n\n“I hope the Mothers didn’t pay you an advance.” I rose from the table. No bounty would be collected tonight.\n\nBut then the bounty hunter did something I did not expect. In a display of sheer physical power, the Shek lunged back from the table and threw off its cloak, revealing its monolithic reptilian frame and gnashing fangs. All that separated me from the space monster was a rusty oak table.\n\n“Seriously?” In times of panic, sometimes the only thing the mind can do is ridicule.\n\nThe Shek snarled.\n\n“Ok, whatever,” I said, hoping I sounded braver than I felt. “Go and pout somewhere else.”\n\nI was not prepared for what came next. The Shek pounced across the table with an aim to rip off my head. It didn’t get far. A wall of energy emanated from the Vapor table and sprung up between me and the lunging Shek. The Shek’s burning red eyes widened at the last moment, aware of the new obstruction, but its inertia was too much, and there was an audible crunch as its frame impacted the barrier. The Shek crumpled to the floor, tangled in its blood-red robes.\n\nI’d been playing Vapor for a long time, but I’d never seen anything like this. I figured there’d be some sort of anti-rage protection for all the sore losers. The Colonists had loved violence, but not against each other.\n\nQuiet lingered in the pub. No one knew what had happened. I braced my hands on the table and pushed myself standing, then turned to face the murmuring crowd. They were hidden in the dark again. Flickers from the swaying orb light lit up the shock on their dumb faces.\n\nIt was time to leave.\n\n“C’mon, Blink. Let’s get the hell out of here.”\n\nThe Whippet jumped from its bed of straw and pranced to my side. It had a pure white and fawn coat and walked around like nobility. It was a creature from another time—one where nobility still existed.\n\nWe brushed passed the onlookers and made for the exit. It was howling wind outside, and the first flakes of winter were settling on the muddy ground. I pulled Blink’s coat from my sack and draped it around him. He wasn’t meant for this kind of weather.\n\nNeither was I, for that matter. I pulled my collar up around my face and tilted my head forward, bracing against the stinging cold.\n\n*Onward.*\n\n* \\n *\n\n ", "timestamp": 1633459826, "digest": "j1FVpY07rcejZlUmM8bSl4agAY5WyPnnX3wpcwESln8", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "1-RvCbfdlJVRAu_6n1KMVXrJeyWOdZuc1-NmB4i1ww0", "title": "Chapter One: Charlie Storm", "body": "Charlie Storm didn’t know today would be his last among friends and family. Getting ready for school in the morning, Charlie went about the same routine as he did every day: he scoured his closet for his cleanest and freshest smelling clothes, threw them on, then ran to the kitchen, where he stuffed his mouth with a piece of peanut-butter smeared toast, all while listening to his favourite music—bagpipes—and humming along as best he could, which, he would be the first to tell you, was not very good.\n\nHe left his home in a flurry and began sprinting down the street toward the bus-stop, groaning as he glanced at the plain-black watch attached to his wrist. He’d be late again, and Mr. Snyder, his insufferable homeroom and math teacher, would surely have him in detention after class—most likely sat in the desk specially set aside for the “troublesome child.” Charlie went to detention so much he considered it just another class to get through before the school-day was done.\n\nSoot quickly charred Charlie’s pants as he ran and kicked up dust from the unpaved road. The town in which Charlie lived lay hidden in the mountains on the west coast of Canada, among the remnants of mining operations that had helped to build the great railroad spread\n\n out across the land, and the town was named accordingly: Black Rock. To clear a path for the railroad, miners had used tons upon tons of dynamite to blast the mountain to pieces. The resulting char was forever ingrained into the remaining stone.\n\nBlack Rock was no longer useful for any great projects or plans, but merely existed—and within it, the people, too, merely existed.\n\nThe lack of adventure and excitement was excruciating for Charlie, and his troublesome ways were merely a product of his attempt to spice up his life. He didn’t fit in with the normal teenagers or with their ideas of fun. He couldn’t play hockey very well and thus couldn’t join the only sports team in town, nor did he enjoy watching, and so he didn’t go cheer on the others. Charlie wouldn’t be caught with that crowd, anyway.\n\nInstead, Charlie liked experimenting with limits: How high could he climb before the air became too thin or he became too cold? How often could he skip school before someone noticed and got him in trouble for it? How many times could he spray-paint green Mr. Snyder’s prized poodle?\n\nThese were of course the simplest and least exciting of Charlie’s tests. Charlie’s affinity for pushing limits coincided nicely with his love for science, and he often spent his hours playing with chemistry sets or building things he learned about in physics books. Just last week he had taken a coil of copper and wrapped it around a piece of metal, attaching one end to a set of batteries. The resulting solenoid had proved destructive when he had broken one of his mother’s paintings with a golf ball he had fired through the house. Even now, in his pocket he felt one of the black powders he had found on one of his treks into the mountains and secreted away. \n\nCharlie’s parents discouraged his pursuits but did little to stop them altogether. But if any of the other adults in town ever caught wind of what he played around with, he was sure he’d have to find new hobbies.\n\n“Let’s go, let’s go! Sick of waiting for you, Mr. Storm. Move it!”\n\nA woman with red hair and cracked skin yelled at him as he scrambled the last few feet to the bus, the big yellow brick—the cheesewagon—herding all of the town’s highschoolers and snagged a seat at the front. It was only one of a few seats left unoccupied, as the gangs and groupies had taken up everything in the back and middle.\n\n“Late again, Chucky? Haven’t you learned to use that hideous thing strapped to your wrist?” A hawkish-looking girl yelled at him from the back of the bus. She was surrounded by a gaggle of wide-eyed followers hanging to her every word. “What is it that you’re wearing, anyway? If you’re going to keep us waiting you might as well have the decency to spare our eyesight.” Raucous laughter erupted from the sitting circle of girls, cheering at Cindy Martin’s slight. She was the queen-bee, and her sycophants were her mindless workers. She even looked the part today, adorned in a bright yellow sundress with black trim and leathery boots. A white orchid poked out from her immaculately crafted hair, which fell around her face perfectly.\n\nThe scene made Charlie want to throw up in his mouth, but that would just give her more ammunition. Instead, he just ignored her and stared out the window.  \n\nThe cheesewagon made its way around town, swerving through winding streets carved into the mountainside, bumping over asphalt not paved for many years, and picking up somber-looking kids wherever it went. School was never a popular destination for those who would rather sleep and play video games, but life to a 15-year-old was hardly fair. Charlie daydreamed about what he might get up to this afternoon once the final bell had rung—likely something involving black powder—while taking in beautiful glacier-tipped skies. A lone falcon soared through the air, seeming to follow the path of the bus, and every-so-often flapped its gigantic wings to continue its forward motion.\n\nThe bus finally arrived at his school. It was not that impressive, really. The front entrance stuck out from the rest of the building, which had the look of a castle made of Lego; the squared lines and turns in the brick could have been designed by a child, and the building’s reddish colour did nothing to add to the charm. The bus driver, an ancient man with a grizzled beard and wrinkled hands, pushed the level to the bus’s front door. It made a small hiss as it folded open, beckoning to the stink of teenagers to flow out. The driver inhaled deep and slow as if to emphasize this cleansing. “Out you go, brats!”\n\nStudents immediately stood up and started yelling conversations, discussing homework, rumours, sports, and parties. They climbed over seats and pushed each other to the side, wrestling towards the exit. Testosterone was fierce in Black Rock. The dullness of life was tempered only by an inevitable passion to compete with each other.\n\nCharlie just kept sitting in his seat and staring out the window. The falcon that had flown along with the bus now sat perched atop the school’s flagpole, which rose high from the entrance to the school. A large flag bearing the mighty maple leaf flapped in a strong wind, slightly in conflict with the falcon perched so majestically and so statuesque in the sun. Charlie looked at the falcon with a new interest; he could have sworn it was looking straight back at him. For a moment, he felt unnerved and uncomfortable, but he quickly dismissed the feelings. He always felt that way. He just didn’t fit in.\n\nCharlie was last off the bus, as usual. He pulled his backpack tight and picked at peanut butter caught in his teeth. Satisfied, he moped his way to his homeroom class, careful to avoid any other school figureheads like Cindy Martin. He wasn’t afraid of confrontation or any unfortunate run-ins, but he definitely preferred to avoid them. The last time his temper flared in the face of an aggressor, his punishment had been severe—Mr. Synder had said it “fit the crime,” though Charlie hardly believed scrubbing toilets in the hockey team’s dressing room was proportional to breaking Josh Tennenbaums’ prized stick—even if Josh was the captain of the team and “number one in the hearts of all Black Rockers.”\n\nMr. Snyder was already calling attendance when Charlie entered the classroom, and made very sure to slow his words and gaze at Charlie as he took his desk. Charlie wasn’t late, and so Mr. Snyder couldn’t technically punish him, but Charlie knew a technicality wouldn’t stop the vile teacher from attempting to make Charlie’s life miserable. Mr. Snyder proved him right.\n\n“Ah, Mr. Storm. Please turn in your assignment right away. Placing it in this box shall do.” Mr. Synder pointed to a flat cardboard box sitting on the table in front of him. It looked like it had previously contained a case of soda or cheap beer. Classy.\n\n“What assignment are you talking about? There’s nothing due for homeroom, and I know you know that.” Charlie’s indignant tone was quite clear.  While he didn’t have any problems confronting Mr. Snyder, Charlie had an issue with tact—as in he had none. Mr. Snyder smirked in response,\n\n“Honestly, Mr. Storm, I don’t know how you made it this far in your academic career. You clearly cannot follow instructions. Yesterday your entire class was given a problem set on linear algebra to be turned in to me today. Your classmates have not forgotten, Storm.” Mr. Snyder snatched the box and tilted it forward, demonstrating the stack of papers already lining the stained bottom.\n\nCharlie felt a fury rise up in him,\n\n“This is homeroom, Snyder, not math class. I don’t have to turn in anything to you right now. You’ll have to try harder than that.” A hush fell over the room. While the other students had seen Charlie argue with Mr. Snyder before, he might have crossed the line this time by not addressing his teacher properly or professionally. \n\nMr. Snyder responded in barely a whisper, clipping his words short and staring at Charlie with venom in dull grey eyes.\n\n“You have no respect, Mr. Storm, for your elders or for your betters. You are but a snivelling child, crying how the world isn’t fair. I am your teacher and I want your assignment. If you do not have your assignment to give me, Mr. Storm, then I will add to the detention and punishment you have just earned by way of your insolence. Do you understand me? Actually, it doesn’t matter if you do or you don’t. You will leave this classroom—immediately. You will go to my office and to the punishment desk there within. I assume you remember where that is? Go. Now.”   \n\nWith that, the overweight and balding teacher waved his hand at Charlie and turned back to his attendance sheet, resuming his mundane recital of those supposed to be present. Charlie stood in stunned silence for several moments, trying to process the events that had just transpired. He hadn’t even made it past  the first bell before being hit with the cruel discipline at Black Rock High—just another cause for him to become more isolated from anything resembling a normal adolescence. \n\nHe stood abruptly, scraping the legs of his chair against concrete floors, and stomped out of the room, knocking over a stack of loose-leaf paper with this backpack as he went. The paper fell to the ground and slipped across the classroom, swishing as it went. Mr. Snyder ignored it and kept his face steady as a stone, eyes forward and attention focused. Charlie could never win the war with him.\n\nThe hallways of the school were empty as he made his way toward the north corridor, where the teacher’s offices resided. Here, lockers didn’t crash and bang close, murmuring of cliques didn’t assault his ears, and shrill voices of hallway monitors didn’t drown out his thoughts. Instead, an eerie silence followed him and his lonely footsteps.\n\nThe light seemed to dim as he moved further and further away from his homeroom, and the halls seemed to close around him. It made him claustrophobic, so he ran to one of the large windows lining the hallway. He unlatched it and pushed it up, taking a large breath of chilly air as it forced its way through the opening. Charlie closed his eyes for a second and let the rays of the sun pour down on his face, embracing a moment of serenity he could not find in this place anywhere else. How he wished to be free of Black Rock.  \n\nCharlie opened his eyes, then suddenly yelped, startled by a shadow splaying across the courtyard in front of him. The shadow was large, about ten feet from side to side, and had sharp edges and prongs poking out from weird angles.\n\nThe shadow moved, extending itself vertically in a ruffle of lines. Charlie stuck his head out the window and peered left towards the sun, trying to spot the figure responsible for the darkness, but all he could see was a bird sitting on an eave of the school.\n\nNo, not a bird—it was a falcon. The same falcon that had chased his bus and sat atop the flagpole.\n\n It sat there unmoving and stared at him. Charlie pulled his head back inside and looked up and down the hallways. He saw no one. All was still. An eerie sensation caused his skin to prickle. The shadow seemed to grow larger on the schools’ lawn.\n\nCharlie turned away from the window and shook his head, eager to forget the experience. He resumed his march towards Snyder’s office. At the end of the corridor, something flicked past his vision and moved quickly out of sight. Charlie was scared now, turning his head left and right as he hurried his steps. The eerie silence of before magnified, and his perceptions narrowed. It was as if there were no living creature around for miles and miles, and he was left alone in a world abandoned.\n\n*Am I going crazy*, Charlie wondered? He had just been in a classroom full of disgusting teenagers, smelling awful and picking at themselves, learning to live with their changing bodies and hormones. He was no more alone than any of them. But he couldn’t explain his feeling that something was terribly wrong.\n\nTrue to his nature, though, Charlie ventured forward, testing his limits. He didn’t care that he couldn’t hear anyone. He didn’t care that everything seemed darker and smaller, or that something big had just rushed past the end of the corridor. He didn’t care that a falcon was following him. He didn’t care that Snyder would not be happy to discover he was not waiting for him in his office, ready for another serving of discipline. Though he was afraid, Charlie was excited. Something at last was happening to him that merited his attention.\n\nCharlie pulled from his backpack a flashlight, flicked it on, and crept forward, making sure to stick close to the lockers against the walls. A few times as he progressed, his bag snagged onto a lock or a piece of metal sticking out, causing him to curse under his breath. Every sound now echoed and crashed in his ears.\n\nThe end of the corridor approached now, and Charlie could now make out the sound of rustling of fabric coming from behind the corner. He crouched low with his back to the wall, his backpack pressing into him so that he wasn’t exactly flush. He flicked off his flashlight and sat in what was now utter darkness. All the lights in the school had extinguished themselves, as if they had winked out of existence. As slowly and quietly as he could, Charlie peeked his head around the corner. He wasn’t prepared.\n\nLarge gloved hands swooped down and grabbed him by the collar and yanked him standing, then quickly wrapped a piece of cloth around his mouth. Charlie bit his lip, and a metallic tasting trickle of blood ran down the inside of his cheek. He was slammed back against the wall and held there in place. Charlie couldn’t see what was restraining him, but his attacker now stood several paces from him and loomed large in the dark.\n\nThe attacker made a swift movement and Charlie flinched, expecting to be hit; instead, he heard the striking of a match. A blue flame erupted in front of him, lighting his surroundings in an eerie haze.\n\nHis attacker did not look right. He, if it could be called that, stood seven feet tall at least, and was draped in a silver cloak. The hands that cradled the blue flame were wrapped in a black fabric of some kind, seamless and strong. The attacker’s face reflected the flame sharply, for his facial structure was very boney, and the skin sat taught over them. A square jaw protruded from under pursed lips, and the man appeared to have no hair on his face whatsoever.\n\nNone of these features were as weird, though, as the eyes. Charlie could only describe them as milky white and swirling, constantly in motion. The attacker peered at Charlie, unblinking, taking in the boy with an almost insatiable curiosity. \n\nCharlie could not tell if the man meant him harm—or, at least any more that he had already caused—or if he simply wanted to ask him a question. The moment lingered for what seemed like an age. Charlie realized he was the only one breathing. His attacker, the man with the milky white eyes and silver cloak, just stood in place as if a statue. Charlie struggled to free himself from the wall, but he simply could not move. Finally, the man spoke.\n\n“You are the first.” That was all he said. Charlie blinked, dumbstruck, and just looked back at the man. It made no sense. Charlie tried to speak and found this time he was able.\n\n“What do you mean I’m the first? Who the hell are you? Why did you attack me? Why can’t I move? Why is it so quiet? Where is everyone? How did it get so dark? What the hell?” The questions escaped Charlie’s lips in a matter of seconds, running together to form one long sound. He doubted this bizarre-looking man would answer his questions, if he had managed to understand them.\n\n“Do you answer the call, Invoker?”\n\n*Ok, I need to get out of here*, thought Charlie. Drug addicts did not frequent Black Rock very often, as there was no real reason to supply such a boring city. Everyone who lived here descended from mining families or academics, and everyone here knew each other.  No one dealt drugs and no one used. So why was there a tweaked-out freak now in Charlie’s school, and why was he calling Charlie the first and Invoker?\n\n“Are you going to hurt me?” Charlie asked in a very matter-of-fact manner.  He tried to not make any emotional pleas or appeal to any sense of reason. Only someone clearly out of his or her mind would dress up in a silver robe, wax their body clean of any hair, and do something funky to their eyes. The man’s response to Charlie was to simply ask his question once more,\n\n“Do you answer the call, Invoker?” This time he asked more forcefully.  Charlie thought he detected a pang of desperation in the words. So weird.\n\n“Yeah, sure. Whatever you say, guy. Just let me go.” The silver-robed, milky-eyed attacker closed his eyes and smiled. He stood for a moment, not breathing, not moving, and just smiling in place with his eyes closed. The scene reminded Charlie of standing in front of a great marble-fountain statue at night.\n\nSuddenly, without hesitation, the man jolted his eyes open and punched Charlie in the face. Blood spurted from his nose. \n\n“Your blood has now been spilled, Invoker. The call has been answered.” Whatever force was restraining Charlie vanished, and he collapsed to the floor and cupped his nose. It hurt more than he remembered, having been the recipient of blows to the face before, and the blood ran sticky through his fingers. But as painful as it was, he didn’t think it was broken. He knew that pain too well.\n\nHe took a few minutes plugging his nose with tissue from his backpack, and slowly got to his knees. The light had restored itself in the hallways of his school, and the corridors were now packed with students staring at him and with looks of confusion and bewilderment. Some pointed and laughed. Most had mouths agape and dared not speak a word. Mr. Snyder stood at the forefront of the crowd of onlookers, arms crossed and great belly drooping over his belt, a smirk of satisfaction on his ugly face.\n\n“Fighting invisible people, Mr. Storm? Accidentally hit yourself in the face? I hope that doesn’t hurt too much, and I hope your nose stops bleeding. Wouldn’t want you messing up my furniture, would I. Get a move on, boy. Now.”\n\nCharlie scowled and got to his feet. He didn’t know what had just happened to him, but it seemed as if it had all been in his mind. Snyder had implied he had been fighting with invisible people. Charlie didn’t think he could live that down.\n\nHe dragged himself to Snyder’s office and plopped down into the hard, wooden chair he frequented so often. Waiting for Snyder to return and no doubt make his life more miserable than it already was at that moment, Charlie couldn’t help but notice the falcon sitting on Snyder’s windowsill, unmoving, eyes fixed.", "timestamp": 1633462570, "digest": "nwE2nasv5yNSS40gu2gMgCNXw2BkQc88e3p6nJD0EiQ", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "4YWVGhyx_-4D9IYxLyfzuaPUovHLm9qkIH_awCL1WsU", "title": "Chapter One: The Vacation", "body": "We walk in tandem along the riverfront, side by side by side. Our colours match: dark blue, grey, black trim. I’m wearing trousers, of course, as is Oliver. They are straight-legged, unlike the sagging bottoms they wear in North Dome. Mary sports a long skirt, but there is nothing the Protectorate can do to prevent her legs from being seen.\n\nI chase the thought away, for it is dangerous.\n\nWe are a team—a unit—and our days are spent together in the factory, assembling and testing various components of some import or another. It is valuable work, they say. It is honourable. We’re not told the why or the what, but it is easy enough to see our lives are made easy if we just obey.\n\nAt night, we sip wine and eat bread on the curbside of our favourite bistro, discussing current events in the Protectorate and watching the circus of street performers go by. Routine is my anchor in a world I struggle to understand.\n\nThe bistro is our destination, and our table awaits us when we arrive. We seat ourselves in chairs rusting at the ends, too long spent in salt air beneath citizens like us seeking respite from the day. We watch the sun as it sets. It casts an orange glow that ripples in the streams of the harbour, but I’ve not the words to describe it, for I cannot abide the luxury of charm. From here, near the water and the perimeter of our zone, I can see the curvature of our dome as it extends high over our heads. It is much easier to describe, though it deserves no description.\n\nI shake my head to rid myself of the scorn creeping through. Thankfully our food arrives, and I bring my attention back to my compatriots. We immediately engage in conversation, picking up where we left off the night previous, as if there is one continuous stream of discourse running through our perpetual trio.\n\nMary is the brightest of us, and she opines in detail on the sociopolitical implications of North Dome’s extension toward the south—toward us—as she chews her food and washes it down with Western red. Of course, she only demonstrates the benefits of the movements. There can be no costs. It’s rather boring, but we must oblige her. It’s hardest for Oliver, whose face contorts as he listens in earnest to Mary’s observations. He is overt with his displeasure, which is exceptionally dangerous. Mary and I have learned to accept Oliver’s indiscretion—indeed we may have developed a fancy for it, like a pleasurable taboo, not that we’d know the feeling such a thing would inspire—despite the ever-present fear of being watched, caught, and disciplined.\n\nI must admit, there is a thrill to being in the presence of rebellion, but then I have for some time felt myself slipping from order. Indeed, when I wake up each day I am plagued with forbidden thoughts. It scares me. I cannot afford to think so negatively. My career and livelihood depend on keeping the course—adhering to protocol—and never, ever allowing innermost dreams, or desires, to seep out like an infection. Yet it continues, like an overflowing fountain of sin. Only my bonds with Mary and Oliver preserve me. Only indulging in Mary’s sermons and Oliver’s plain contempt stay the tides of collapse I fear may sweep over me.\n\nAm I different? It’s impossible to know. I recall the faces of those who passed me along the riverfront. They are bland, without expression, yet their owners seemed content. At least they did not appear sad or frustrated or disturbed. The Protectorate tells us this is social order: carry out your lives with your units, and return home to your assigned partner to sleep and procreate. Is this living? Have I ever known how to live?\n\n“Isn’t your first vacation upcoming, William?” Mary asks me in a suggestive tone, breaking the monotony of the conversation in which none of us were ever invested. She surely knows the answer, but it is polite to inspire conversation with a question.\n\n“Is that right?” Oliver is astounded, on the other hand. “But you’re always so balanced, William. So calm! I’d have guessed you’ve taken a hundred vacations by now to be so centred at your age.” Oliver scratches his head. “What is your age? I don’t think I’ve ever asked.”\n\n“You have not, and I’ve never offered the information,” I say. “I’m thirty-five tomorrow, if you must know, though I feel much older.”\n\nOliver claps, and I nervously swivel my head taking in my surroundings on the cobblestone, but there are no drones hovering near us. Oliver’s exuberance is undetected. “Right on schedule for your first vacation! You will *adore* it, William, I promise you. And what’s this talk of feeling old? Perhaps that will change quite soon, eh?” Oliver’s eyes twinkle.\n\n“Will you keep your voice down, sir? Please and thank you.” I deliver my rebuke with all of the force of a statue’s caution. Oliver sits back in his seat and brings his face neutral, though the spark in his eyes remains. “Of course, William,” he says, his voice flat. “Have you yet received instructions?”\n\n“He won’t have, Oliver.” Mary interjects, at the same time flicking her brown hair over her shoulder. It was a curious gesture, but pleasant. “Recall your first, if you can—no instructions, no details, just left to figure it out.”\n\n“Ah, yes,” says Oliver, and the corners of his thin lips turn up ever so slightly.\n\nI watch their interaction, confused and curious. It is true I will embark on my first vacation soon—next week in fact–and it is also true I have received no information other than to pack light and be timely. My partner, Sarah, has been on many vacations, that much I’ve gathered from our evening chats, but she has never shared anything about them. A sadness floats into her eyes whenever the topic arises, and I dare not push further lest we be fined. So, I am alone, without course or direction, left to fend for myself in the unknown. This is dramatic, I know; anyone who speaks of vacation does so with a perilous glimmer of excitement. Anyone to whom I’ve spoken other than Sarah, that is.\n\n“Yes, Mary,” I say at last. “I leave next week.”\n\nMary dangles her wine glass from a finger and bites her lip. I cannot help but notice and, to my surprise, flutter. Her movements are stirring in a way I know is improper. What would Sarah think to see me like this? Would she report me?\n\n“How do you feel about it, William?” Mary’s question is shocking, and I am unprepared. I nearly spit out my wine—what a disaster that would have been. There need not be drones nearby for that.\n\n“Feel?” I ask, less for clarification and more to probe why Mary would use such a word. She does not answer. Instead, she pulls a long drink from her glass, never letting her unblinking eyes leave my face. It is unsettling, and I stuff my mouth with bread to distract. A silence lingers between us three, interrupted only by the sounds of the streaming river and joyless cries from those out to enjoy the night. In that moment I dissect years of unity with my companions, thinking back on Oliver’s derisive gestations and Mary’s subtle seductions, and I chide myself for not being more diligent. In truth I should have reported them long ago. I knew where this was heading. I knew only bad things would result. Yet I am here, and perhaps I am not so different.\n\nWe finish our meal in the same silence, never returning to the topic of my vacation, nor revisiting our previous ramblings. Instead, we allow the evening to permeate around us, allow the humidity in the air to weigh us down, our heads most of us. And then, when we are done, we leave together and make our way home. We say our good evenings as we enter our adjoining domiciles, and I imagine we each kiss our partners on their respective foreheads as we begin to recount our day, until the street lights twinkle and go out, and the signal to sleep is received.", "timestamp": 1633462911, "digest": "V9m2r2x1AGkYaTP6dud3ug6SqxI0wZjDiv1KdMF4e2Q", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "7i2A7hpZWDgvGDP3DeZIO2mksUlJ_ySZ1kD98MDuY84", "title": "Chapter One: Vapor", "body": "*Shit.*\n\nI yanked my finger away from the spiral groove I’d been tracing in an oak table. It had been carved with some dull blade who knows how long ago. The table looked ancient—nothing more than rotting planks of wood strapped together by rusted iron bands—except for the smoke-filled glass protruding from its centre.\n\nWith clenched teeth I snagged the splinter sticking out of my skin, then shook the pain out and winced. An orb of translucent metal swung back and forth in the draft of night air that seeped into the pub through cracked walls and thin windows. Fluorescent light flickered inside. It was Colonist tech—probably third gen. I pulled my cloak tighter, sheltering against the brisk evening. The chill added to my irritation; the struggle taking place in front of me was taking too long. \n\n“Did I forget to mention it’s your turn?” I asked with bite.\n\nMy opponent didn’t even pretend to notice me. A heavy sigh escaped my lips and I leaned back in my rickety chair. My fingers wandered back to the groove. I didn’t know what else to do with myself, so I just held my breath and stared across the table and continued tracing, forcing thoughts out of my head. I tried not to drive myself into a fury as boredom set in and dulled my senses. I closed my eyes. This was always the worst part.\n\n“So, who you for?” I asked.\n\nSilence. The hulking figure sitting on the other side of the table continued to ignore me, unwilling to break his concentration.\n\n“I’m guessing the Mothers, right?” I continued. “Yeah, that’s gotta be it. Those robes give you away. They’re too clean—ain’t no soot on them—and I see too much red.” \n\nThat earned a glance up at me and away from the arena.\n\n“Hah, I knew it. See a lot of shit doing what I do—lotta people, and the things that drive them.”\n\n“You talk a lot.” The response was more rumble than speech, and it was telling. On the next flicker of light from the swaying orb, I looked closer at my opponent’s hood and saw pointed protrusions from where ears should have been.\n\n*Fuck.*\n\nMy opponent was Shek—don’t know how I missed it. These bastards were a plague on the Saved World, but they mostly stuck to the Last City with the cartels. What the hell was it doing out here? \n\n“Sorry—old habits.” I said. “I’m on the road so much and I’ve only got Blink to talk to.”\n\nAt the sound of his name, my Whippet raised his head and perked his ears. He leered at me, unblinking and dutifully awaited orders. Good dog, that one. He was one of a kind, a relic, and had been expensive as hell. I told him to go back to sleep, so he did.\n\nI noticed the Shek staring at my dog. The bristles beneath the Shek’s cloak weren’t visible, but I knew they’d be standing on end—razor sharp spikes prickling out of its spine.\n\n“Don’t worry. I think you can take him.” I smiled.\n\nThe Shek shot his blood red eyes at me before returning his attention to the game.\n\n“You been towing for the Mothers for long, Shek?”\n\nI needed answers. It was strange to see a Shek in these parts—stranger still to see someone wearing cartel colours. It bugged me.\n\nThe Shek finally rumbled a response: “They pay well.”\n\nAh, there it is. This Shek was here for me. I should have known I’d be found eventually.\n\n“Oh, I’ve no doubt. Let me guess: bounty hunter?” I spoke loud enough for all to hear.\n\nImmediate tension flooded the pub and drowned its patrons. A dozen other conversations hushed. Drinks stopped sloshing on the floor and were set down on tables. Hazy eyes clouded by ale became refocused, all pointing our way.\n\nThe Shek didn’t react. It was all the answer I needed.\n\n“Gotcha.”\n\nThe Shek’s eyes burned beneath its hood and an even deeper rumble shook from within. It was laughing. “We have you.”\n\nThe corners of my mouth turned up. “Is that right?”\n\nThe Shek didn’t answer. Instead, it finally decided on its play and hunched closer to the table. Wisps of light danced out of its outstretched fingers and converged between clawed hands now sticking out from its robes. The light swirled into it coalesced into a pulsing ball of light. The ball grew and intensified, and when it seemed as though it would hit a critical mass and explode, consuming the pub and everyone inside, it suddenly went completely still and assumed a form of solid, blue incandescence.\n\nThe form was a medieval warrior dragging a comically-large axe behind it. Sparks shot up from where the axe raked against the table as it made its way into the middle of the arena.\n\nI barely contained explosive laughter and looked at the snarling bounty-hunter.\n\n“Seriously? It took you half an hour to do that?”\n\nThe Shek’s fangs glistened and its eyes burned hotter, but it stayed still. “Your words will not save you.”\n\n“Can I ask you something? How much are the Mothers paying to take me down? I’m curious. Last week I was way up north in and heard something about what the Fathers were offering, and, frankly, I was shocked. There’s no way the Mothers would pay that well—are they?”\n\nThe Shek shook off my question. “Time to lose.”\n\nI decided I’d had enough. “No, I don’t think so.”\n\nI hunched forward and examined the game state. Several red, ephemeral figures were spread out in the large and hollow sphere embedded in the middle of the oak table. The forms inside were basic cylinders and took no other shape. They were pitifully small and not at all intimidating compared to the bounty hunter’s blue axe-man—by design.\n\nI chuckled and wondered how long it would take these roaming mercenaries to figure out the system I had conjured years ago while huddled in the corner of an alley in some broken town, sheltering myself from unnatural rain. It had just come to me, and right there, in the pouring wet and filth, I had worked out an idea in my head. Red light had sparked between my fingers and danced in the rain. I must have looked like a homeless lunatic driven mad trying to conquer the secrets of Vapor, as most did in these forsaken times.\n\nI looked up at the Shek and stretched out my hand, a gesture of civility.\n\nIt didn’t understand. “What is that?”\n\nI was offering him a way out. It was the decent thing to do, I guess, and I wasn’t sure why I kept putting a draw out there for lesser challengers, game after game after game. Maybe it was just my dumb luck that no one had ever accepted.\n\nThe bounty hunter rumbled and bristled, ready to seize its prey. Then it shook its head and snapped its jaws.\n\n“If you insist,” I said, turning back to the game and giving the closing some final thoughts. It would be closer than I liked, but I was confident. And tonight, I was trying something new.\n\nMy hands began to do their work and a familiar hum filled the air. My face glowed red behind my own ball of energy. At the point the humming reached its crescendo, no similar axe-wielding form emerged. Instead, twin beams drifted forward like grasping hands. They worked their way across the table, slowly, and entered the hollow sphere, heading straight for my little cylinders.\n\nThe Shek watched, confused. Throughout the evening I had witnessed the Shek’s tactics. They had been pathetically basic and straightforward. Most played like this. It was a product of battling in seedy pubs on the outskirts of civilization for scraps from the warring factions’ tables: Mothers, Fathers, or Unknown...it didn’t matter. They all went after the same thing the same way.\n\nMy new gameplay was getting attention, and the Shek wasn’t the only dumbfounded person in this shithole. Drunken observers had inched closer and closer until they were standing in a circle around the table, taking in something they’d never seen before\n\nAll hell broke loose when the twin beams hit the cylinders. The beams, previously slow, accelerated to incredible speeds upon first contact. They streaked between each cylinder, clockwise, forming a solid ring of light around the bounty-hunter’s blue avatar. The opponent’s axe was woefully ineffective as it swung around and around trying to chop the energy field. It was painfully clear that the Shek’s axe-man was doomed. The solid ring of light was constricting and would soon consume the figure.\n\nAt the last moment, the ring of light pulsed outwards and cascaded through the pub. For a brief instant, I could see every crack in every wall and all the insects scurrying to find dark shelter. I could see the awestruck faces of the toothless villagers and the padded bras hiding beneath the serving girl’s chests. Most importantly, I could see the anger roiling on the scaled face of the Shek sitting across from me.\n\nIt was over in less than a second after the twin beams had hit the cylinders. A chain reaction of energy spun exponentially until it unleashed a tidal wave of searing light that melted the blue axe-man into oblivion. The hollow sphere powered down, indicating the end of the match. I had won—again.\n\n“I hope the Mothers didn’t pay you an advance.” I rose from the table. No bounty would be collected tonight.\n\nBut then the bounty hunter did something I did not expect. In a display of sheer physical power, the Shek lunged back from the table and threw off its cloak, revealing its monolithic reptilian frame and gnashing fangs. All that separated me from the space monster was a rusty oak table.\n\n“Seriously?” In times of panic, sometimes the only thing the mind can do is ridicule.\n\nThe Shek snarled.\n\n“Ok, whatever,” I said, hoping I sounded braver than I felt. “Go and pout somewhere else.”\n\nI was not prepared for what came next. The Shek pounced across the table with an aim to rip off my head. It didn’t get far. A wall of energy emanated from the Vapor table and sprung up between me and the lunging Shek. The Shek’s burning red eyes widened at the last moment, aware of the new obstruction, but its inertia was too much, and there was an audible crunch as its frame impacted the barrier. The Shek crumpled to the floor, tangled in its blood-red robes.\n\nI’d been playing Vapor for a long time, but I’d never seen anything like this. I figured there’d be some sort of anti-rage protection for all the sore losers. The Colonists had loved violence, but not against each other.\n\nQuiet lingered in the pub. No one knew what had happened. I braced my hands on the table and pushed myself standing, then turned to face the murmuring crowd. They were hidden in the dark again. Flickers from the swaying orb light lit up the shock on their dumb faces.\n\nIt was time to leave.\n\n“C’mon, Blink. Let’s get the hell out of here.”\n\nThe Whippet jumped from its bed of straw and pranced to my side. It had a pure white and fawn coat and walked around like nobility. It was a creature from another time—one where nobility still existed.\n\nWe brushed passed the onlookers and made for the exit. It was howling wind outside, and the first flakes of winter were settling on the muddy ground. I pulled Blink’s coat from my sack and draped it around him. He wasn’t meant for this kind of weather.\n\nNeither was I, for that matter. I pulled my collar up around my face and tilted my head forward, bracing against the stinging cold.\n\n*Onward.*\n\n* \\n *\n\n ", "timestamp": 1633459826, "digest": "j1FVpY07rcejZlUmM8bSl4agAY5WyPnnX3wpcwESln8", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "BYXBh_s8a2aFebhvzKaM5cQ49H1MGbYuHNQM60l7UDs", "title": "Chapter One: Ascension", "body": "Takha peered up into the hazy orange dawn. His eyes traced concentric circle rings running around an otherwise seamless tower that stretched from the ground before him and up into the Sky. He pushed his gaze as far as he could. Images of the Ascended danced through his mind. He imagined they wore all white and glowed under a halo of sunlight. This imagery sprung into his mind like an echo. Of course, he did not really know. He could not. No one could, nor could anyone tell you what really waited for them in the Sky. But everyone wanted to get there and find out. The people in the Muck didn’t know anything else. Everyone born here was raised with an eye to the Sky. Ascension.\n\nToday was Day One of the new Cycle. Takha sat on a slab of shattered stone directly across the street from the tower. His stone. He had sat there at the beginning of every new Cycle for as long as he could remember. His feet no longer dangled below him, kicking in anticipation of the faces that would pass him by on their way to the Passage. He grinned to himself at the memory of his heels bashing into the stone and the bruises left behind. No more. Now, his toes gripped into the ends of his shoes, firmly planted in the reddish dust that lined the streets of the Muck.\n\nThe crowds grew around him in the early dawn of Day One, undeterred by the morning chill. The lack of light in the Muck meant living in a perpetual shadow. Takha was always cold. Everyone was always cold. Yet people with tattered cloths and grimy faces streamed past Takha at his stone perch, chattering and reverberating with an infectious energy.\n\nThere were many hopefuls, and each took their place in one of several lines that had begun forming at different points along the Passage – a ring of panels at the base of the tower. Each line outstretched from a panel, and each line was growing long, like spokes from a wheel. Many more onlookers took root around Takha and beyond Some lay on withered grass and some draped out of their broken apartment. Some just stood in the dusty streets. The onlookers were either too young or too old, and they were either eagerly waiting for their time and their cycle or they were reminiscing about opportunity lost. The Passage would not respond to anyone below sixteen years of age or anyone older than twenty-five. If you didn’t Pass during the time in between you would be stuck in the Muck. Forever.\n\n“Takha! Over here!”\n\nTakha snapped his gaze into focus and followed the voice. He turned his head to the eastern most point of the Passage and saw a hand waving from amidst one of the lines. The hand flowed from a chubby arm that connected to a broad-shouldered boy with black hair and a toothy grin. It was Dento, his childhood friend. Takha smiled. Today was not only Day One of a New Cycle. Today was also Dento’s birthday. His sixteenth birthday.\n\nTakha and Dento were perhaps the most inquisitive of the 235s. They spent the majority of their days immersed in Lore, absorbing knowledge as if water in a desert. They learned of the magic of mathematics and language, the history of their ancestors and the path of the people before, and the wonderment of stories and emotions and what it meant to be human. They solved puzzles and played games. They read books and they wrote poetry. And they harnessed the knowledge that flowed from Lore like mills in a river. To follow this path was to become worthy of Ascension. Takha and Dento spent their entire lives in the Muck learning how to escape from it. And now, one this Day One, Dento would seize his chance.\n\nTakha jumped off his stone and strolled through the crowd towards Dento. Takha’s height was unusual in the Muck. The people were well nourished on account of the supply ships that descended every quarter-cycle. But the lack of light and the denser atmosphere of the Muck caused the people to grow more compact. Gravity. So said the Lore. In spite of this, Takha stood taller than most buy a large margin, so as he worked his way towards Dento he could see all the life bristling around the Passage. Day One was a holy day.\n\nTakha arrived at his friend’s place in line and looked down at the chubby boy. Takha examined the face smudged with dirt, white eyes brimming with fervor.\n\n“Are you ready, Dento?”\n\n“Of course!”\n\n“What is the precise distance from the Muck to the Sky?”\n\n“Easy, Takha. One point three kilometres.”\n\nTakha eyed his friend and remained sceptical. “And the authors of the First Global Constitution?”\n\n“Anderson, Weng, and Denton, if you mean the Monarch Papers; Tandingo and Santiago if you mean the Essays of the Republic. The Honourable Justice Twinfeathers, if you mean the final resolution and confirmation. Be specific, Takha.”\n\nTakha smirked. His friend was ready. One more, though.\n\n“What colour is my shirt?”\n\nThe chubby boy flinched, almost losing grasp of his consuming joy. But he held firm. “Nice try, Takha. You will not take this day from me. You know as well as I that there are too few panels calling a colour test. The odds are good—very good—and I am too happy to wonder on the alternative.”\n\nTakha flashed his own grin. “So be it.” He clapped his hand down on to his friend’s back. “Then this is where we part. I wish you luck, but not too much. It is my turn next cycle, and I shall hope to see you in the rings. Do not ascend without me.”\n\nDento beamed at his friend and waved as Takha retreated back to his stone. The chubby boy turned back to face the base of the Sky Tower and the Passage. The line ahead of him was quickly shrinking. Challengers in front of Dento and all around the Passage were turning away in defeat, crushed and in agony from their failure. The older the potential, the more brutal the despair. The twenty-five-year-olds were the worst, often breaking down and falling to the dusty ground, curled up in fetal positions. A display of utter helplessness. Sometimes Takha could hear a cheer lost amidst the cries, and he would catch a glimpse of a jubilant hopeful welcomed inside the Passage through a suddenly gaping hole where the panel had been. He hoped Dento remained confident.\n\nAt last, Dento’s time came. He stood at the tip of the line, nothing but unyielding blackness stretching to the horizons to each of his sides, and swallowed. He took several unsure steps from his place in line and stopped when he stood just shy of the Passage. Then he waited, but not long. The Passage shimmered before him and hummed into life, immediately displaying several complex equations. They radiated an electric blue and, while Dento could not see the colour, it did not matter for this particular type of examination. He exhaled deeply, relieved there would be no tasks of colour-based pattern recognition. He was secure in his own grasp of quantum mechanics.\n\nDento knew the equations would be visible to all who watched him attempt to secure entry through the Passage, but he refused to allow his nerves to overcome his calm. Instead, he began to wave his hands in the air, manipulating the symbols before him and drawing new lines of light on the panel. Time passed slowly and sweat beaded on Dento’s forehead. Eventually, numbers appeared in the top right corner of the panel and began counting down. Dento’s test was drawing to a close, one way or another. Dento squeezed his eyes and chewed his lip and struggled to find a solution. But, with little under a minute remaining in the examination, everything clicked in Dento’s head. He waved his arms in a flurry and then abruptly stopped.\n\nLights pulsed on his panel of the Passage, indicating a correct solution. The onlookers saw the blue lines of light turn green, and before Dento could himself react there was an eruption of jubilation that overcame him from behind. When realization swept over Dento and he finally did react, he fell to his knees under the weight of emotion. The panel in front of him winked out of existence and pulsed again with a white light around edges of a newly formed doorway, beckoning the successful ascendant to enter. Dento cried softly to himself and rose to his feet, slowly making his way into the tower and the beginnings of his Ascension.\n\nTakha had been watching from his atop his shattered stone. He had followed along with every wrong presumption and incorrect calculation. He had silently celebrated when Dento stumbled upon the corrections and worked his way to a solution. And he had mourned the closing of his lifelong friendship. Even if Takha made it past the Passage on his own Day One, he was not sure he would ever see Dento again. The concentric rings lining the Sky Tower were many, and broad, and Takha thought there were many steps to take along the path.\n\nLost in contemplation, Takha slipped away from his stone and made his way back to the Library and to the Lore, his mind firmly fixed on the next Cycle.\n\n \\n \n\n ", "timestamp": 1633463073, "digest": "jsk00xAY3IWIs50ppCLkuRWHEDTpxl4xCkcQ6FWJj_8", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "BZqPE8miuw2hqv4wXYFJASrt0MrgG4Zs8WHvE6DcrD4", "title": "Chapter One: Shadowdancer", "body": "Izak woke up while falling from the sky, and he could not seize the wind to slow himself. He pulled at the threads of the air and commanded it to slow his descent, but it would not listen. So he fell, and kept falling, and the ground filled his vision until he saw nothing else but his impending death. It would come too soon for him. He’d only just graduated from the Trials. Years of hard work—of sweat and tears—would be wasted. In the fleeting seconds he had left, his mind filled with hatred—for the wind, and for its little masters who would not hear Izak’s call.\n\nAnd then a strange thing happened. His descent slowed, and the rush of the air that had filled his ears died away. His body righted itself until his feet were beneath him, and then he floated the remainder of the way to the ground, like an autumn leaf on a breeze, until he set down in the middle of a clearing.\n\nTall grass surrounded him—pale green, almost yellow, like the fluttering ribbons that hung throughout the Ferundi territories—and the pink hues of the second sun painted the horizon.\n\nImmediately after he landed, Izak ducked low and crawled into the grass in a bid to hide himself. The wind still would not answer. It terrified him. When was the last time he’d been unable to summon the Naiads, he wondered? The Naiads’ silence screamed in his mind, perhaps as loud as the confusion that engulfed him.\n\nHe didn’t know this place. It was still Ferundi lands, yes, but nowhere like he’d seen, or like he’d heard about, during all of his travels and studies. The lake south of him should not have existed, for the seasons had run so dry for years on end. To see a body of still water—especially one so large—defied everything he knew about the world. To the east he saw a mountain range. It was so close he could trace the contours of its foothills as they rolled over the plains. Perhaps they were an outcropping from the other side of the Banna mountains, but no maps he know revealed territory to the west, nor any paths to venture upon to get there.\n\nIt took only a few moments of wayward thought over his whereabouts before Izak turned his inquiry upward, to the sky.\n\nHow? Why?\n\nSitting in the brittle grass, Izak bit his tongue to stop from sobbing. Devotion to the Naiads did not allow for weakness; they would not respond to the meek. It had been his first and most important lesson as he navigated the Trials, one imparted long ago by a woman far wiser than him. She was a professor—the professor—of the Zoren, and her face drifted into Izak’s vision. He tried to push the sight away, and he shouted into the still of the morning: “I am not weak!”\n\nHis voice sounded through the valley. It was a mistake. Suddenly, there was a rustling in the grass. Not the sound of movement like the echo of a breeze, but more violent—purposeful. Izak did not like it, so he jumped to his feet and ran into the clearing and away from the grass, turning to face what was coming and instinctively reaching for the wind. He found nothing. He was helpless. The Naiads had abandoned him, and had been left to die alone.\n\nBut he again avoided his fate, for a girl emerged from the grass, gasping for air as she tried to catch her breath. The fear upon her face eclipsed the fear surging through his body, and when she laid eyes on him she began weeping. Her tears flowed freely and fell to the ground. Izak stood there, struck silent and flustered, until the girl fell to her knees. Only then did he move—toward her, not away.\n\n“Why are you crying,” he asked. It was an odd sensation to feel compassion in that moment. There in the grass, lost and scared and unable to feel the tingle of a connection with the Naiads, his mind had reached for a shred of humanity to right himself. Yet he remained aware of his vulnerability.\n\nThe girl sniffled. “They’ll find us,” she said. Izak came closer, then sat on his heels and looked the girl in her eyes—crisp, violet eyes that danced. Izak restrained his shock. She was a firebreed. Izak’s instinct urged him to pull away, but he resisted. Us, she had said.\n\n“Who will find us?” he asked, but she shook her head. Izak threw more questions at the terrified girl: “Why am I here? Where are we?” His anxiety rose again, and the noises around him awoke, his senses no longer deafened by the fall and the fear. He heard the howling in the distance for the first time. A storm would come—soon. It would swirl inwards from the horizon, like all storms, culminating in a vortex that would last through the night.\n\nIzak reassessed his surroundings. It was imperative to find shelter, and quickly, and then to double-back at the right moment. Dodging storms was ingrained into him—a natural truth, like breathing. But there were other worries at the moment, and he needed to understand.\n\n“Listen to me.” Izak did not want to push the unstable girl, but she would not listen. “Listen!” He gripped her shoulders. “We need to leave. Do you understand?”\n\nShe nodded, and her autumn hair swished as she rose to her feet. Izak stood with her, and then they faced each other at full height. The girl’s composure seemed to return. Her tears had stopped flowing, and her lips no longer trembled. She raised her arm, slightly, and offered her hand. Izak grabbed it, and the girl immediately tugged; together, they ran through the grass and toward the forest.", "timestamp": 1633462643, "digest": "gPc8WfeHZqEL8FiL1_e6mPAELy7RtUgwShIW6jTAulY", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "cm0JKECDYl7Gnv_MhmlE6-pddKUrX31NQGCK4LIslb8", "title": "Chapter One: Counterpoint", "body": "I still didn’t know what was going on. I remembered walking through night-markets in Shinjuku, eating fried octopus and watching neon lights ripple in the air over thousands of crowded locals and tourists alike. I remembered seeing a light, intense and enormous, then hearing screams and the pounding of feet on pavement. I remembered waking up in this room.\n\nThere were others, maybe a few hundred. No one had talked me or answered my questions. Not even when I had yelled or beat my hands against grey walls until my fists bruised and bled. The others had just sat and watched, twirled the ends of their sashes in their hands or laid back on beds protruding from the floor. I became accustomed to silence.\n\nSeveral more newcomers had appeared in the room since I first woke up. I hadn’t seen them arrive. How was that possible? They must have arrived while I was sleeping, awoken to their new reality just like I had. Each arrival wore similar clothes—white, loose fitting but durable robes, like a uniform or a gi from a martial arts studio, cinched by different coloured sashes. I counted four: blue, red, green, purple. To pass the time, I tried to find patterns, segment the colours between girls and boys, by age, by hair and skin colour, by height or weight. I’d always been good at patterns, but I saw nothing.\n\nNothing made sense. I would have gone crazy if not for the chimes. One for a meal, two for a snack. Three chimes to indicate a bathroom break, followed by the materialization of a door—or a dematerialization of a part of the wall—and a hallway flickering with hazy illumination. Before yesterday I’d never seen anything appear or disappear in such a way, but I didn’t care about spectacles or illusions or physics. I focused only on keeping sane, fighting the disassociation assaulting my mind. The chimes offered routine, and I clung to them.\n\nI listened to four chimes while laying on my bed, and then the room went dark with the thunk of powerful lights being deactivated. Immediately, the stars far above the windowed ceiling revealed themselves and began to twinkle. My eyes drifted to a large orb, bright and blue, and I played with one thought before falling asleep: *Where am I?*\n\n \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n \n\nThings changed in the morning after the breakfast chime. Our food trays disappeared into the ground, fizzles from existence like the coming and going of the bathroom door, and then the room moved. It had been rectangular, cavernous, like a warehouse storing sacks of flesh and blood. Now it became square and squished, the ceiling so close I could reach up and touch the glass of the window. It was cold—very cold—and I pulled my hand away.\n\nMurmurs filtered through us, whispers and questions revealing fright and dismay. Our nature brought us together and we huddled as close as possible for several hundred bodies. Then four doorways materialized, one for each wall of the square. Behind each door stretched a hallway lit up by a different colour, one for each of our sashes: blue, red, green, purple. Five chimes rang, and the murmuring became a crescendo of confusion. No one moved to the hallways. Everyone stayed huddled in the middle of the room. Some yelled and swore, cussing at no one in particular. The five chimes rang again, and the square shrank. A girl screamed, and a young boy began crying. An older boy knelt beside the crying boy in an attempt to provide comfort, the first display of kindness I’d seen. Still, no one moved. The chimes rang again. The square shrank, the walls so close those of us on the outer edges of the huddles mass could brace against them.\n\nThe implications were simple, so we started shifting to the hallways matching our sashes. I gripped mine by the dangling end and raised it in front of me. The material was soft, but when I tugged at each end I could sense its toughness and tensile strength. I let it fall to my side and then end bounced against my knee, then I walked to the edge of my hallway. A girl stepped next to me and I looked at her, measured her. She appeared about my age and stood a foot shorter. Her oval face ended in a point at her chin and she set her jaw firm, framed by long black hair and bangs that did not entirely hide green eyes, narrowed and angry.\n\n“My name is Ikko,” I said.\n\nThe girl shifted a glance but did not respond. I contemplated her for a moment before turning away and stepping side the hallway. My gi tinted green under the lights and I walked forward into a future I did not understand, to a destination I did not know. I looked back to see the others with green sashes follow me, led by the black-haired girl.\n\nWe walked straight ahead for a long time. The hallway never turned or curved. The floor under our feet was cold and smooth, formed by the same polished metal from within the room. So were the walls, which had no doorways or seams. Claustrophobia set in, and the sounds of breathing grew more laboured and rapid. More of us cried, pleaded for parents and familiar faces, horrible despair echoing through the tight corridor and infecting my calm. I tried to resist the temptation to give in to the agony of the unknown until the very end.\n\nI was saved by the end of the hallway. When I stopped and pressed my palms against the door, I closed my eyes and squeezed out a single tear. I wiped it away with the end of my sash, then turned to the mass of bodies who had stopped behind me.\n\n“We are here,” I said.\n\n“Where is here?” The black-haired girl spoke with no emotion in her voice, cold as the ceiling that had sheltered us from the stars. I had no answer, so I gave none. Instead, I pushed against the door. It did not swing open or give way, but it dematerialized as the others had done.\n\nAnother room opened before us. It was circular and ringed by a series of bed stacked three high. In the middle of the room I saw several chairs and tables, and upon those tables various contraptions made of a shimmering metal. And furthest from the door, a man sat at a desk. He also wore a gi—green, not white like ours—wrapped by a white sash. The man’s hair was tied up in a knot atop his head. His eyebrows were thick and bushy, and a single strip of beard fell from his lip below his chin. When we opened the door and entered the room, he stood from his desk and clasped his hands behind his back.\n\n“Welcome, Greens.”\n\nThe others fell into a flurry of motion and noise, running to them man and screaming, slamming their palms down on tables and kicking chairs. They wanted answers, they said they deserved answers, and they were right. I demanded answers, too. Why had we been brought here? Where was *here*? Who had brought us, and when would we return?\n\nBut the man offered no answers. He simply watched, silent, unmoving. Eventually the screams petered out, the disorder quieted, and the Greens began laying on bed or sitting in chairs. The stink of defeat sat heavy in the still air of the circular room. Only then did the man speak.\n\n“I will return in seven days.” A door materialized behind the man’s desk. He left and the door dematerialized, replaced by smooth, polished wall, leaving us alone with each other and the tables and the strange metallic contraptions upon them.\n\n“This is bullshit!” An older boy yelled at the wall and returned to disorder. Many joined him in throwing the contraptions around the wall and overturning furniture. I watched but did not give in to my emotion. Instead I called upon a stream of calm running through me, focused on self-control. I remembered kneeling in the grass while a gentle breeze flowed through my hair and rustled cherry blossoms. The memory was fuzzy and fragmented. How long ago had it been? How long have I been here?\n\n“You seek zen.” The black-haired girl stood next to me. She, too, removed herself from the chaos of the Greens who rejected their reality and expressed themselves with rage. \n\n“Where are you from, Ikko?”\n\n“My family lives in a small city in the north—Kakunodate—and I grew up in and around there. More recently I moved to Tokyo proper to pursue further training.”\n\n“Training for what?” she asked in earnest.\n\nI hesitated to tell her the truth, because my family and friends believed my pursuit to be foolish. Most refused to support me. Some would not even talk to me any more. They had preferred for me to focus on education and career, to become a salaryman like my siblings and cousins. But I had never developed that interest, had never wanted to follow that path. I had chosen for myself and accepted the consequences.\n\n“In the ways of bushido and samurai.”\n\nTo my surprise, the girl did not scoff or shrug. She did not cast judgment or seek to lecture me on honouring my family’s wishes. Instead, the girl crossed her arms and kept her eyes on the chaos unfolding in the circular room. Then she spoke.\n\n“My name is Hatsue. I am from Osaka.”\n\nI’d never been to Osaka, nor anywhere else in the country other than my small village and the sprawling metropolis of Tokyo. “What’s it like?”\n\n“Osaka?” She bit her lip and tugged at one the curving strands of hair that framed her face. “Vibrant. The people are friendly and the city is alive. And the food is amazing.”\n\n“Do you eat away from home often?”\n\n“I must, as I am a chef. My speciality is soba noodles, which I make from scratch every day.”\n\nI was impressed. Though I lacked experience in my own country, I understood its culture deeply. Crafting soba noodles was a thorough and detailed process. It took meticulous and time-consuming attention. Hatsue was an artisan. Nothing like me. No pattern.\n\n \n\n“Why do you think we are here, Hatsue?”\n\nShe finally turned to look at me, uncrossing her arms and gripping me gently by the arms. “I have been asking myself that question for two weeks.”\n\nTwo weeks? Hatsue had been here much longer than me. “How many of you were there when you woke up?”\n\n“A few, maybe a dozen,” she said.\n\n“Did you speak with anyone?”\n\n“No. No one seemed eager for conversation. We were all to confused and frightened, and that disarray only continued as more and more people began to appear.” She paused and cocked her head. “I remember when you arrived. You were among the last.”\n\nI squeezed my eyes. “I remember a bright light, and screaming.” I opened my eyes. “We ran.”\n\nHatsue nodded, recognition in her face. “I also saw a light. We also screamed and ran.”\n\n“What was it?”\n\n“I don’t know. Does it matter?” She shook her head. “We are here, and that man is returning in seven days. We are called Greens and there are a number of puzzles scattered about the room. Maybe we should keep our focus there until the man returns.”\n\nI squinted, inspecting Hatsue’s eyes and the corners of her mouth. “You are exceptionally calm. Perhaps you would be interested to the ways of bushido.”\n\nAt last, Hatsue smiled. “Perhaps I have been. Come,” she grabbed my hand,” let’s go talk to the others and try to figure out what it is our hosts expect from us.”", "timestamp": 1633463020, "digest": "WqfStekH7Ujt6IiWdHIvf64aC__Ih2OgODEWuSavWPw", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "DnDc7s_6AR9sJUeeWWdKCso2nlM3-6RNurgzdzax-jU", "title": "Chapter One: The Showdown", "body": "\"Not far now,” I yelled over my shoulder. Pa lay drunk in the wagon rolling behind the horses I guided, laid out from two pints of gut warmer drained before noon. Left me to finish a drive alone again. One cowboy, two hundred heads, and there’d be hell to pay if any disappeared. Pa’s been for certain about pulling in more pieces.\n\nI pulled my shadowmaker lower on my face, squinted into the sun-drenched horizon past hoodoos sprouting from the badlands, and chewed at a piece of straw. It didn’t taste like anything, but kept my mouth wet with saliva and tricked my mind. Can’t remember where I picked up the habit. My skin had long ago darkened and tightened from the everyday sun, and long, wavy black hair had turned brown and flattened.\n\nNot many drove the Old Road. No fresh grass or fresh water this way, and dry heat sucked moisture from bone. Wasn’t any shorter either, still a week’s ride to Junction, the first border town to the east. Not even marshals roamed this far from Homestead. Something else brought cowboys over the desert. Freedom. Liberty from the Syndicate and the gallows, no hangin’ for using what burned within.\n\nA kick of my heels spurred Marrow to a slow trot along the cracked, dusty trail slowly funnelling between two cliffs. I passed a section of scorched rock, eyes following a wave of black growing higher and wider. Stretching from my saddle, I reached out and dragged fingertips against the surface. Sparks flickered and faded, the still air broken by sizzles and hisses. I gazed at the blue fire glowing through but not burning my saddle gloves, an ever-present itch just beneath my skin begging to be set free. The Blaze. Wicked, but powerful, even then urging me to wield the flame. But I didn’t.\n\nDaylight slipped away, and I managed to drive the herd to Junction without issue, no need to draw upon the Blaze. The cattle marched quiet over a crest of rock and down until the ground turned to yellow, brittle weeds and prickle shrubs barely moving a breeze blown in by the dusk.\n\n“Evenin’, ma’am.” A farmer walked besides, hauling a bundle of harvested corn.\n\n“Evenin’.” Kept chewing my straw, staring straight ahead. Too many faces in my life, coming and going through the Outskirts. Didn’t need another.\n\n“Quite the shadowmaker you got there. Never seen one like it.”\n\n“That right?”\n\n“Would pay a good share of pieces for it.”\n\nI pulled on Marrow’s reins and stopped, turned my head and glared down at the farmer. My shadowmaker used to be Ma’s, quick as she was. One day she’d not been quick enough. With her last breath she had told me to wear it well, make her proud. Wore it every day since, though I wasn’t no fighter and likely never would be—not if I spent my days driving cattle. Pa had tried to take the shadowmaker from me once, probably for sellin’—the famous shadowmaker of Giddy O’hare—but I had fought back something fierce. That day I discovered the Blaze. Pa never tried again.\n\n“It ain’t for sale.” I put ice and poison into my words, easy for a cowboy. The farmer took the hint and hurried away, circled wide around the herd now marching well ahead of me. Several other labourers scurried back to town, sometimes shifting heads and casting glances my way. Not many came by the Old Road, and those who did, like her, brought trouble.\n\nPa roused by the time the horses and wagon rolled up to the town’s gates, shaking his head and spitting the leftovers. No praise, no gratitude for lining his pockets, but I didn't expect any. Ten years since my first drive, and never a word of encouragement or smile. Just work. Pa didn't even pony for any new gear, and I spent most of my pieces getting equipped. Most. My fingers traced the single piece sitting my pocket. The beginning of my way out. \n\nI nodded the brim of my shadowmaker at locals slack-jawin' at our entrance, just two cowboys and a two hundred heads. Gates opened, allowing me and Pa to steer the cattle inside, set to eating grass and standing around. We sauntered into the town like black thumbs, gawked and pointed at by old folk and youngins’ walkin the streets. Not too many cowboys came this way, only once in a while. More pieces for less work in the Core. Junction and its folk settled on the inner perimeter of the Outskirts, or the outer edges of the Core, depending on how you looked at it. Close enough to attract trade, get fed, but too far to earn respect, be protected. The Syndicate didn't care about towns like these. If bandits came, they came, and people moved on. Life on the brink, some called it.\n\nAlways looked forward to drives to border towns. The people shined brighter, played harder. Maybe that's why Pa took more contracts in these parts, never hard to find a game of vapour, far enough away from roaming marshals to gamble without fear of the gallows.\n\n\"Where's the saloon?\" Pa shouted at a milkmaid cleaning her bottles under the water tower, spittle dripping down his chin and almost keeling over. The milkmaid soured and pointed to a three-story building nested between a smith and post office. Pa grunted, shook his reins and headed that way. I followed, but cast a sympathetic look to the woman, used to cleaning up after Pa's indiscretions.\n\n\"Stay here, Ellie,\" said Pa, dismounting and stumbling his way inside. I sighed, readied for a long night of waiting for Pa to lose his pieces and pass out with a belly full of whiskey.\n\nEven at the evening hour, people worked. Not just piano players and dancers in the saloon, flickering light and laughter escaping the swinging doors. Outside, the smith hammered iron, forged by intermittent streaks of blue fire from his fingertips illuminating the registration papers hanging from his stall, clangs ripping the air and echoing into the night. Several folk tended horses tied up to posts, lumped straw beneath their stouts and filled buckets, and lit candles near their droppings, the mix of smells confusing my nose.\n\nBut the jewel of the evening lay with the Showdown. The Syndicate may not operate on the brink, but the Showdown circuits came this far and further, even to the edges of the Outskirts. Nothing fancy this far out, nothing wild like in the stories from Homestead, and no heroes or legends. Just plain old draw and shoot. Men and women, boys and girls, cowboys and charlatans, farmers and other folk, all roped into the border circuits by some misfortune or another.\n\nWhen I saw the ring, the gathering of voyeurs around an erected platform, I rushed to the barricade around its edges and found an open space, stepped up on the wood and braced arms over, eager to glimpse the next draw.\n\nInto the opening walked a man, wide steps and jingling boots, white ten-gallon on his head and a bristly moustache below his nose. Forty? Fifty? The wrinkles in his skin stood out despite the dusk. The fighter didn't bother to engage the crowd, focused only on the woman twenty paces away. She wore a striped barmaid's dress, red top, black bottom, frilled and puffy, and blond hair pulled up in a bun. An entertainer, she took time to walk around the barricade and drag a fingertip over the lips of howling locals, then pulled it away, revealing a tiny gleam of blue fire.\n\n\"Folks, tonight the Showdown offers you a fight for the ages.\" The announcer standing in the middle of the platform grabbed the crowd's attention, his words inflected and urgent. \"First, a veteran of the circuits, born and raised a fighter, Blaze like you've never seen, I give you Jacob,\" the announcer elongated his next words, \"Two-Twin Jacobs.\"\n\nI pumped a fist as the rest of the onlookers cheered. Two-Twin was a veteran all right. In every town, I zealously sought information on the Showdown, heard tell of duels near and far, and so I recognized his name. Never seen him fight before, though. Never even seen a bounty poster, no wanted signs for a career fighter in the border towns.\n\nMy excitement faded quickly at the sounds of drunken gamblers pouring from the saloon. Pa used to love the Showdown, travel all around and watch Ma fell men twice her size. He had inspired my passion years ago, long before he lost himself to whiskey. Now Pa barely bothered, bristled at a mention.\n\n\"And his challenger, a local, you knew her well, stealer of hearts and pieces, life of barmaid in the saloon, now making her mark with her Blaze, it's Miss Poppy!\" The crowd roared louder, euphoric with their Junction fighter. \"You won't see this again for a hundred turns, I guarantee it. Bet those pieces, place your wagers, pony up if you're so sure. Who will it be, old and steady or young and unpredictable? The clock strikes soon.\"\n\nThe gamblers yelled in unison. Five pieces on the old man! Ten on the wench! Bet he downs her with one shot! Not a chance, sun sets for the old man! Pieces traded hands, flicked in the air, exchanged for slips of paper. Coins rattled in saddlebags and pouches. The commotion almost drowned out shouts drifting from the saloon, where no doubt Pa's game of vapour grew serious.\n\nI frowned, just one piece in my pockets, residue from the last drive. I needed the piece, the first step towards something else, more than driving cattle between holes in the ground. Heard tell of a Showdown gang up near Tallhill, could buy in for training and all that. But the evening air blew different, shooed my caution. Would be a long time until Pa and I made it out west again, or anywhere near Tallhill. And stakes put the barmaid ten to one, offered a jump start toward my something else when I finally got there. New blood and an old man who didn’t look his legend. Seemed clear to me.\n\n“I’ll put a piece on Poppy!” I flipped the metal in the air to the passing bookmaker, who caught it and handed me a slip confirming my bet. I clutched it to my chest and looked up and across the square to the town clock.\n\nLess than one minute to the hour. Two-Twin and Miss Poppy stared at each other, oblivious to their surroundings, hands by their sides, index fingers extended from balled fists and thumbs stretched out. No regulators on their fingertips, no rules out here. The quicker draw took the day, the slower dead to rights and left to mercy. Sometimes they got it, and sometimes they didn’t. Life on the brink.\n\nA crow hovered above, its caw clear and crisp. The frills of Miss Poppy's dress billowed in a faint breeze, and Two-Twins lip twitched, his moustache moving in unison. Silence fell about the crowd until only the ticking clock cut the evening. I heard my breath, squeezed a gatepost and leaned forward, afraid to blink.\n\nChime. The fighters reacted at once, too fast to perceive. Two-Twin snapped his hand from his side and pointed his extended index finger at Miss Poppy, the hint of a flame at his fingertip. He pushed his thumb down, a trigger, and his Blaze combusted with a sharp, loud crack. Blue fire shot toward Ms. Poppy in narrow, parallel beams, straight as a blade. But the barmaid pivoted in a circle at the chime, feet shuffling, frills raised and twirling, until she came back around and faced Jacobs. The twin beams singed her puffy blouse but missed their mark. As she finished her rotation, in one fluid movement, she clapped her hands together, index fingers side by side, cracking the air louder as her Blaze ignited, unleashing a rippling stream of blue fire, more flat than tall. It caught Two-Twin in the chest and knocked him ten feet back and to the ground, crumpled against the side of the barricade.\n\nThe gamblers roared, deafening the cries and whoops from the saloon, and pieces started changing hands again, diving deep into saddle bags, matched by curses and laughter. A man ran over to wear Two-Twin lay, dead as a doornail, a giant hole burned in his coat and a swollen bruise on his lifeless chest. The man stretched out a rope, took measurements for the coffin. Miss Poppy curtsied to the body before rounding the observers to collect her winnings. I tipped my shadowmaker at the defeated fighter, extinguished faster than greased lightning. Ma always said to respect the dead, especially Showdown fighters. Honour ain’t dead if even one person remembers, she said.\n\nWhen the barmaid circled to where she stood, I held out her chit, beaming. “I picked you!”\n\nMs. Poppy returned the smile. “Smart girl.” She looked at the paper, frowned. “Just one piece?”\n\n“Sorry, it’s all I have.” I jerked her thumb behind her to the saloon. “Pa’s in there spending the rest on whiskey and vapour.”\n\nThe fighter smiled, big and bright. “Gotcha. Bobbeh,” she waved to the bookmaker,” pay this doll her money.” Bookmaker Bobbeh waddled over until he stood next to the barmaid, head coming level with her shoulders. He inspected my paper and flipped seven pieces over the gate.\n\nHell, I had forgotten the rake. No matter, seven was still better than one. Ms. Poppy turned away, but before she moved on I blurted her mind. “Where did you learn to do that?”\n\n“Do what, honey?” The barmaid looked over the side of her shoulder, eagerness on her face to keep collecting.\n\n“Control your Blaze, make it ripple.” I held out my hands, tiny sparks at the tips of my fingers. “Mine just explodes out, you know? No focus.”\n\n“Takes time,” said Ms. Poppy. “But a cowboy like you probably doesn’t get much opportunity to practice, drive to drive, marshals at your back.”\n\n“You ain’t wrong.”\n\nMs. Poppy laughed, curled her finger and beckoned me closer. I leaned in and the barmaid whispered, “Only place you’re going to learn is in the Showdown, honey, where the money’s good. Not worth the risk otherwise; not even in the Outskirts. Tell you a secret, though. It’s not how pretty you make the Blaze; it’s how fast you are, how precise. Worry about that first before you look to entertain.” Ms. Poppy left with a wink, off to gather the rest of her prize.\n\nI jumped down, boots sinking into mud which I scraped off as I made my way back to the saloon. Raised voices continued to seep into the deepening night, the game far from over, Pa still afloat, somehow. I rattled the seven pieces in my pocket, a fortune. Briefly, my mind flashed a new saddle. But no. Instead, I strolled through town looking for a market open at the late hour, which I found. Two pieces bought freshly ground coffee, a few husks of corn, and jerky. A hearty breakfast for a new day, and something to take the sting out of Pa’s hangover.\n\nSatisfied, I sat on the porch, crossed my arms on my knees and rested my head, settling in for a later night than expected.", "timestamp": 1633460325, "digest": "a7z6sBzLvf-d9rxJ8vz8rmawwZYoF6q7NX451ZwZDF0", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "dReMgnUvuKuRcTggswZfn_KNKiK6WWievklfiFYtG9s", "title": "Chapter One: The Vacation", "body": "We walk in tandem along the riverfront, side by side by side. Our colours match: dark blue, grey, black trim. I’m wearing trousers, of course, as is Oliver. They are straight-legged, unlike the sagging bottoms they wear in North Dome. Mary sports a long skirt, but there is nothing the Protectorate can do to prevent her legs from being seen.\n\nI chase the thought away, for it is dangerous.\n\nWe are a team—a unit—and our days are spent together in the factory, assembling and testing various components of some import or another. It is valuable work, they say. It is honourable. We’re not told the why or the what, but it is easy enough to see our lives are made easy if we just obey.\n\nAt night, we sip wine and eat bread on the curbside of our favourite bistro, discussing current events in the Protectorate and watching the circus of street performers go by. Routine is my anchor in a world I struggle to understand.\n\nThe bistro is our destination, and our table awaits us when we arrive. We seat ourselves in chairs rusting at the ends, too long spent in salt air beneath citizens like us seeking respite from the day. We watch the sun as it sets. It casts an orange glow that ripples in the streams of the harbour, but I’ve not the words to describe it, for I cannot abide the luxury of charm. From here, near the water and the perimeter of our zone, I can see the curvature of our dome as it extends high over our heads. It is much easier to describe, though it deserves no description.\n\nI shake my head to rid myself of the scorn creeping through. Thankfully our food arrives, and I bring my attention back to my compatriots. We immediately engage in conversation, picking up where we left off the night previous, as if there is one continuous stream of discourse running through our perpetual trio.\n\nMary is the brightest of us, and she opines in detail on the sociopolitical implications of North Dome’s extension toward the south—toward us—as she chews her food and washes it down with Western red. Of course, she only demonstrates the benefits of the movements. There can be no costs. It’s rather boring, but we must oblige her. It’s hardest for Oliver, whose face contorts as he listens in earnest to Mary’s observations. He is overt with his displeasure, which is exceptionally dangerous. Mary and I have learned to accept Oliver’s indiscretion—indeed we may have developed a fancy for it, like a pleasurable taboo, not that we’d know the feeling such a thing would inspire—despite the ever-present fear of being watched, caught, and disciplined.\n\nI must admit, there is a thrill to being in the presence of rebellion, but then I have for some time felt myself slipping from order. Indeed, when I wake up each day I am plagued with forbidden thoughts. It scares me. I cannot afford to think so negatively. My career and livelihood depend on keeping the course—adhering to protocol—and never, ever allowing innermost dreams, or desires, to seep out like an infection. Yet it continues, like an overflowing fountain of sin. Only my bonds with Mary and Oliver preserve me. Only indulging in Mary’s sermons and Oliver’s plain contempt stay the tides of collapse I fear may sweep over me.\n\nAm I different? It’s impossible to know. I recall the faces of those who passed me along the riverfront. They are bland, without expression, yet their owners seemed content. At least they did not appear sad or frustrated or disturbed. The Protectorate tells us this is social order: carry out your lives with your units, and return home to your assigned partner to sleep and procreate. Is this living? Have I ever known how to live?\n\n“Isn’t your first vacation upcoming, William?” Mary asks me in a suggestive tone, breaking the monotony of the conversation in which none of us were ever invested. She surely knows the answer, but it is polite to inspire conversation with a question.\n\n“Is that right?” Oliver is astounded, on the other hand. “But you’re always so balanced, William. So calm! I’d have guessed you’ve taken a hundred vacations by now to be so centred at your age.” Oliver scratches his head. “What is your age? I don’t think I’ve ever asked.”\n\n“You have not, and I’ve never offered the information,” I say. “I’m thirty-five tomorrow, if you must know, though I feel much older.”\n\nOliver claps, and I nervously swivel my head taking in my surroundings on the cobblestone, but there are no drones hovering near us. Oliver’s exuberance is undetected. “Right on schedule for your first vacation! You will *adore* it, William, I promise you. And what’s this talk of feeling old? Perhaps that will change quite soon, eh?” Oliver’s eyes twinkle.\n\n“Will you keep your voice down, sir? Please and thank you.” I deliver my rebuke with all of the force of a statue’s caution. Oliver sits back in his seat and brings his face neutral, though the spark in his eyes remains. “Of course, William,” he says, his voice flat. “Have you yet received instructions?”\n\n“He won’t have, Oliver.” Mary interjects, at the same time flicking her brown hair over her shoulder. It was a curious gesture, but pleasant. “Recall your first, if you can—no instructions, no details, just left to figure it out.”\n\n“Ah, yes,” says Oliver, and the corners of his thin lips turn up ever so slightly.\n\nI watch their interaction, confused and curious. It is true I will embark on my first vacation soon—next week in fact–and it is also true I have received no information other than to pack light and be timely. My partner, Sarah, has been on many vacations, that much I’ve gathered from our evening chats, but she has never shared anything about them. A sadness floats into her eyes whenever the topic arises, and I dare not push further lest we be fined. So, I am alone, without course or direction, left to fend for myself in the unknown. This is dramatic, I know; anyone who speaks of vacation does so with a perilous glimmer of excitement. Anyone to whom I’ve spoken other than Sarah, that is.\n\n“Yes, Mary,” I say at last. “I leave next week.”\n\nMary dangles her wine glass from a finger and bites her lip. I cannot help but notice and, to my surprise, flutter. Her movements are stirring in a way I know is improper. What would Sarah think to see me like this? Would she report me?\n\n“How do you feel about it, William?” Mary’s question is shocking, and I am unprepared. I nearly spit out my wine—what a disaster that would have been. There need not be drones nearby for that.\n\n“Feel?” I ask, less for clarification and more to probe why Mary would use such a word. She does not answer. Instead, she pulls a long drink from her glass, never letting her unblinking eyes leave my face. It is unsettling, and I stuff my mouth with bread to distract. A silence lingers between us three, interrupted only by the sounds of the streaming river and joyless cries from those out to enjoy the night. In that moment I dissect years of unity with my companions, thinking back on Oliver’s derisive gestations and Mary’s subtle seductions, and I chide myself for not being more diligent. In truth I should have reported them long ago. I knew where this was heading. I knew only bad things would result. Yet I am here, and perhaps I am not so different.\n\nWe finish our meal in the same silence, never returning to the topic of my vacation, nor revisiting our previous ramblings. Instead, we allow the evening to permeate around us, allow the humidity in the air to weigh us down, our heads most of us. And then, when we are done, we leave together and make our way home. We say our good evenings as we enter our adjoining domiciles, and I imagine we each kiss our partners on their respective foreheads as we begin to recount our day, until the street lights twinkle and go out, and the signal to sleep is received.", "timestamp": 1633462911, "digest": "V9m2r2x1AGkYaTP6dud3ug6SqxI0wZjDiv1KdMF4e2Q", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "eg-LDRNeM7s6az68aE38ecUIMfmbJwDylO52CdoREtw", "title": "Chapter One: Lumi", "body": "Lumi roared into the the rain. She couldn’t hear her own voice , as it was drowned out by the torrential winds ripping at her shirt and through her hair. She kept yelling all the same, until her chest heaved and her breath was exhausted. And then she was quiet—no longer a lion, just a girl in a storm.\n\nNobody had taught her how to be brave, or how to deal with pain, so she’d taught herself. If she screamed loud enough, for long enough, the visions would fade. She hated the scattered memories that weren’t her own, the fractured images that meant nothing, but she could do nothing but stare into the always-grey sky. \\n Quiet now, and drenched, Lumi began her slow walk back home. Her brother would be likely be waiting, back from another day of Labour, and worried sick. He didn’t like when Lumi walked alone at night. It didn’t matter to him that she’d grown up in Junction, or that she knew the streets as well as anyone.\n\nGritting her teeth, Lumi refused to cower, pushing forward into the surge instead of finding shelter and huddling for warmth.\n\nWhen she finally arrived at the bunker, the door slid open and her brother rushed out with a blanket. He tossed it around her shoulders and ushered her inside. Though Lumi wanted to shrug off the blanket and retreat to her room, she allowed her brother the fiction of a family relations.\n\nTheir family was tattered, and had been since their parents had failed to come home after a mission. Instead, a representative of the Republic had visited their door, offering a salute and a kind word.\n\n“Eat,” said Tru. He set a disc on their table. It was full with a beige substance, halfway between liquid and solid. “Sorry, only nutritionals today. It’s this war, Lumi. The Republic is driving Labour harder, yet credit allotments are stagnant.”\n\nShe sat, grabbed a spoon, and began shovelling the paste into her mouth. There was no taste—only texture—and she kept her expression vacant as she swallowed.\n\nTru grimaced. “Sorry,” he said again. He dug into his own muck and ate with the same excitement.\n\n“Don’t apologize,” said Lumi. “I’m the one who’s sorry. You were forced into your path, Tru, and it’s kept us alive. I’ll always be thankful.” She looked away, and wiped a tear from her eye.\n\n“Well, kid, look on the bright side: your path is wide open. Selection is soon, isn’t it?”\n\nLumi nodded. Her seventeenth birthday had come and gone, but the Republic couldn’t test individually—there were far too many wanderers in the world. Twice a year, the Republic sent an emissary to usher the wanderers into one of three paths: Labour, Thought, or War.\n\n The Republic required the completion of many tasks, so most were designated to Labour. It was rare to be selected for the path of War, and Thought was even rarer.\n\nLumi’s parents had been warriors, though she didn’t know what that mean. Her parents had never spoken about their life in the Republic’s army. They’d not even wrote about it in their journal, Lumi’s most prized possession. She found it that day when the representative had come to her door with news of her parents’ deaths, when she’d raged around the bunker.\n\n“You want the path of war, don’t you?” asked Tru. He peered at her with crystal-green eyes, the same eyes she saw when she looked in a mirror, or at a picture of her parents.\n\nOf course she did. “I want to know what happened to them, Tru.” \\n He put down his spoon and sat back. “Even if you’re selected for War, Lumi, I doubt you’re going to find any answers.”\n\nThey’d had this conversation before—many times. “You can’t know that.” \\n “No, I can’t, but think about it, Lumi. Think—that’s what you’re really good at. Why would the Republic care about it? You think they’d allow one of their soldiers to go hunting for that kind of information? What would it mean to them, other than a waste of time and resources?”\n\nTru was right, but Lumi didn’t care. “I’m going to find out. They were special, Tru. I’ve seen the soldiers patrolling the streets, coming and going through Junction like we’re nothing but a harvest for selection. Our parents were different.” \\n Her brother opened his mouth to reply, to continue the familiar debate, but Lumi heard nothing. Her vision had blurred, and her head began to throb so violently that she pushed in her temples as if she could force the pain away.\n\nImages began to dance in her mind. Figures in sleek, white metal jumping and rolling between rubble. Lights pulsing from limbs, explosions and blood. \\n Lumi began to scream—to roar—and her voice echoed throughout the bunker. Tru was by her side in a second. Much too fast for a Labourer, she thought… \\n She awoke on her bed. Tru was mopping her head with a rag, his lips taught and eyes unmoving.\n\n“What did you see this time?” he asked.\n\n“I’ve seen it before,” Lumi answered. “It was the battle, with the white-metal fighters.” She closed her eyes, then squeezed them. “I saw the slaughter again.” \\n Tru placed the rag into a bowl of water, swirled it around, then wrung it out and continued mopping her head.

{"id": "H1DwBwRVH1Z6gmq7loyCCeldGxnYpEe3njGTixeXPs4", "title": "Chapter One: Lumi", "body": "Lumi roared into the the rain. She couldn’t hear her own voice , as it was drowned out by the torrential winds ripping at her shirt and through her hair. She kept yelling all the same, until her chest heaved and her breath was exhausted. And then she was quiet—no longer a lion, just a girl in a storm.\n\nNobody had taught her how to be brave, or how to deal with pain, so she’d taught herself. If she screamed loud enough, for long enough, the visions would fade. She hated the scattered memories that weren’t her own, the fractured images that meant nothing, but she could do nothing but stare into the always-grey sky. \\n Quiet now, and drenched, Lumi began her slow walk back home. Her brother would be likely be waiting, back from another day of Labour, and worried sick. He didn’t like when Lumi walked alone at night. It didn’t matter to him that she’d grown up in Junction, or that she knew the streets as well as anyone.\n\nGritting her teeth, Lumi refused to cower, pushing forward into the surge instead of finding shelter and huddling for warmth.\n\nWhen she finally arrived at the bunker, the door slid open and her brother rushed out with a blanket. He tossed it around her shoulders and ushered her inside. Though Lumi wanted to shrug off the blanket and retreat to her room, she allowed her brother the fiction of a family relations.\n\nTheir family was tattered, and had been since their parents had failed to come home after a mission. Instead, a representative of the Republic had visited their door, offering a salute and a kind word.\n\n“Eat,” said Tru. He set a disc on their table. It was full with a beige substance, halfway between liquid and solid. “Sorry, only nutritionals today. It’s this war, Lumi. The Republic is driving Labour harder, yet credit allotments are stagnant.”\n\nShe sat, grabbed a spoon, and began shovelling the paste into her mouth. There was no taste—only texture—and she kept her expression vacant as she swallowed.\n\nTru grimaced. “Sorry,” he said again. He dug into his own muck and ate with the same excitement.\n\n“Don’t apologize,” said Lumi. “I’m the one who’s sorry. You were forced into your path, Tru, and it’s kept us alive. I’ll always be thankful.” She looked away, and wiped a tear from her eye.\n\n“Well, kid, look on the bright side: your path is wide open. Selection is soon, isn’t it?”\n\nLumi nodded. Her seventeenth birthday had come and gone, but the Republic couldn’t test individually—there were far too many wanderers in the world. Twice a year, the Republic sent an emissary to usher the wanderers into one of three paths: Labour, Thought, or War.\n\n The Republic required the completion of many tasks, so most were designated to Labour. It was rare to be selected for the path of War, and Thought was even rarer.\n\nLumi’s parents had been warriors, though she didn’t know what that mean. Her parents had never spoken about their life in the Republic’s army. They’d not even wrote about it in their journal, Lumi’s most prized possession. She found it that day when the representative had come to her door with news of her parents’ deaths, when she’d raged around the bunker.\n\n“You want the path of war, don’t you?” asked Tru. He peered at her with crystal-green eyes, the same eyes she saw when she looked in a mirror, or at a picture of her parents.\n\nOf course she did. “I want to know what happened to them, Tru.” \\n He put down his spoon and sat back. “Even if you’re selected for War, Lumi, I doubt you’re going to find any answers.”\n\nThey’d had this conversation before—many times. “You can’t know that.” \\n “No, I can’t, but think about it, Lumi. Think—that’s what you’re really good at. Why would the Republic care about it? You think they’d allow one of their soldiers to go hunting for that kind of information? What would it mean to them, other than a waste of time and resources?”\n\nTru was right, but Lumi didn’t care. “I’m going to find out. They were special, Tru. I’ve seen the soldiers patrolling the streets, coming and going through Junction like we’re nothing but a harvest for selection. Our parents were different.” \\n Her brother opened his mouth to reply, to continue the familiar debate, but Lumi heard nothing. Her vision had blurred, and her head began to throb so violently that she pushed in her temples as if she could force the pain away.\n\nImages began to dance in her mind. Figures in sleek, white metal jumping and rolling between rubble. Lights pulsing from limbs, explosions and blood. \\n Lumi began to scream—to roar—and her voice echoed throughout the bunker. Tru was by her side in a second. Much too fast for a Labourer, she thought… \\n She awoke on her bed. Tru was mopping her head with a rag, his lips taught and eyes unmoving.\n\n“What did you see this time?” he asked.\n\n“I’ve seen it before,” Lumi answered. “It was the battle, with the white-metal fighters.” She closed her eyes, then squeezed them. “I saw the slaughter again.” \\n Tru placed the rag into a bowl of water, swirled it around, then wrung it out and continued mopping her head. For a time, he said nothing, and Lumi was grateful. She didn’t want to talk, or remember. She just wanted to sleep. \\n Eventually, her brother gripped her hand, then left the room, shutting the light as he went.\n\nLumi rolled over, desperate to find comfort in slumber.

{"id": "kX_xDYFISBo9aXyvEIKOjvscEVZ_-3asJBWUUbNOCgA", "title": "Chapter One: The Speaker of Runes", "body": "William grew restless and he struggled to focus on the drone of information buzzing from the talking head that floated in front of him, a holographic projection tasked with guiding him through the program. It was talking about the magician war again.\n\nBy now he knew enough about the magicians to elevate to the next cycle, but the curators of the program wanted their participants thinking in lockstep; they did not tolerate a divergence of detail. His eyes wandered to the contours of the projected head and he tried to imagine the technology inside his alcove that brought the speaker to life. The floating head began speaking about human understanding of magic. William smiled at the irony.\n\n*Focus*. His mind was calm. On any other day, he would have panicked at the thought of not being ready for the new cycle, or worse, to be caught distracted. But today, on his sixteenth birthday, he found he didn’t care.\n\nThuds of hardened leather on polished marble floors grew close, and he knew the warden must have entered his aisle, one of many that ran between hundreds of evenly spaced alcoves.\n\nHe’d learned a long time ago to differentiate between administration and elite by their footsteps. Phantom sounds of the clicking of expensive shoes invaded his mind, and he looked to his right to the adjoining, empty alcove where Trevor had sat. The clicking in his mind grew louder, and he squeezed his eyes tight as if he could avoid remembering. He couldn’t, and he watched a vision of Trevor being hauled away by men dressed in black suits, tips of white pocket squares peeking from their breast pockets. Behind them, a white haired man, broad and tall, followed behind with hands clasped behind his back, and the clicking of his shoes faded.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes, he was surprised to see the warden looking down into his alcove and directly at him. The warden wore combat fatigues, grey and white, with shoulder patches that bore the symbol of the regime -  a human, standing with arms akimbo and legs spread, inside of a circle and a square.\n\nHe looked up and met the warden’s eyes, his own carrying a hint of defiance. The warden set his square jaw and glared, bewildered, and spoke firmly.\n\n“What do you think you’re doing?”\n\n William had no response. He continued to stare at the warden instead of engaging with the program. The warden didn’t ask again. Instead, he reached down and grabbed William. With a single jerk of a muscled arm, he was removed from his alcove and slammed face first to the floor at the warden’s feet.\n\nAs he brought himself to his knees, eyes downcast, he was grateful that the warden’s boots were not expensive and did not click. Punishment would be swift, but he would not be dragged away like Trevor, off to be lobotomized.\n\nSearing pain shot through William’s arm as the warden stamped his brand. His skin blistered at the focused heat as it was lasered into his upper arm. It was over in an an instant, but the pain lingered with an intensity that seemed to grow. He’d never before been branded. It would be a black mark on his record, and he’d be unlikely to progress further than the second level cycles. So many years given to the regime - taken by the regime - thrown away in a moment of wayward thought.\n\nWilliam was tossed back into his alcove to re engage with the program, and he did so without hesitation. *What was I thinking?* It hadn’t been his first stray from the regime’s control. He thought of the piece of charcoal sitting in his satchel, and how from time to time he’d scrawl his name upon the base of the nearest skytower. He thought of his sneaking into the Quarantine to walk among the dead. But to openly reject the program and defy the regime, it was beyond foolish.\n\nThe talking head was still preaching. William tuned in, compensating for his behaviour by paying more attention than necessary.\n\n“Scientists postulate that the magicians derive from an parallel universe, and that they’re world exists in the same space and time as Earth. Such theories would explain why they look like us, and talk like us. The universes may be so close that the environment and evolutionary pressures were not dissimilar. ”\n\nWilliam sat straighter and listened in earnest. This information was new, unlike the grand summaries of the war he’d been used to hearing. Possibly the regime was introducing new information at the dawn of a new cycle, an elevated step in the program. His excitement faded quickly as he reached to his throbbing arm.\n\nThe talking head continued. “The practice of magic, of course, is the most distinct of the departures from the same path of selection, natural or artificial, and it remains the grandest mystery from the war.”\n\nLecture stopped soon after, and William spent the duration of the day immersing in the practical application of the program. At birth he’d been selected for engineering, so the panel walls in his alcove were alight with complex equations, radiating electric blue. To answer, he would wave his hands in the air and manipulate them, drawing new lines of light on the panels. Occasionally, when not solving fast enough, numbers appeared in the top right corners of the panels and began to count down. Hurried streaks danced out  his fingers as he raced against time and worked his way through the more difficult equations.\n\nHours later, when the sun began to set and an orange haze settled on this city, the chimes began to sound. He sat back, exhausted, with sweat beaded on his brow. The panels powered down, leaving only inclined walls, seamless and obsidian black, and the floating head snapped out of sight. One of the now dormant panel walls shifted, forming itself into a staircase. He climbed out and joined the ranks of other participants as they shuffled in unison towards the Hub’s exit.\n\nAs he walked, he noticed he was the only standing straight with raised chin, and all around him participants bowed their heads, their faces sullen. He continued to rub his arm as if he could wipe away the regime’s sigil, but the mark would remain, a reminder of his surprising recklessness. *At least the burning will fade*.\n\n“I saw everything.” He hadn’t noticed Jacob had join his side. He stayed silent, eyes fixed forward, and he kept his pace. On a good day, he struggled to bite his tongue at Jacob’s needling. On a day like today, when he needed respite and a place to think, he’d be hard pressed. But to his surprise and relief, Jacob said little else.\n\nThe boys made their way to the Hub’s bottom level and pushed through the crowd that had gathered at the exterior doors, emerging into the cold steel sterility of the regime’s finest city. To the east, at the centre of the city, skytowers soared into the sky, each exactly the same height as the next and evenly spaced. \n\nTheir Hub was built differently, constructed at the city’s edge. It stood only several floors high, but its width spanned several sectors on the grid. The building curved in the shape of an elongated arch, nestled against the border of the Quarantine. Western-facing walls were made of translucent glass, and participants had an unobstructed view of the ancient battleground and the fringe that lay beyond.\n\nWilliam had been gazing into the Quarantine for as long as he’d been a participant, and he blamed the view for his first moment of rebellion. For years he’d been instructed about the desolation within and forbidden from entering, but all he could think about was the silence.\n\nHe remembered his first time, and the stealth he’d conjured to avoid the camera globes mounted at every corner of the city. He remembered cutting through the border fence and finding his way inside, and his first walk amongst toppled buildings and broken cement. Serenity had washed over him, easing his mind from the reality of living in a world devoid of free thought and independence, where every moment of every day was planned with outcomes predicted. Thereafter, every now and then he would venture into the Quarantine as an escape from the program’s daily rigour, even for just an afternoon, or an evening.\n\nTonight, he would visit again. He’d decided to flee into the Quarantine the moment he’d been branded. Even if just for the night, he needed the escape to remain calm and find his balance. *One brand isn’t so bad*. Greater disciplines would be out of reach, but plenty still remained to allow for a comfortable life. If he wanted to ensure a future in the regime of any kind, he’d need to realign and get himself together.\n\n“I’m going for a walk.”\n\nThe sandy haired boy next to him stopped, dropped his satchel to the ground, and placed his hands on his hips.\n\n“What’s going on with you? What was that back there?” Jacob reached out and flicked the brand. William winced and pulled away. \n\n“I don’t know. Got distracted, I guess.”\n\n“You guess?”\n\n“Just drop it.”\n\n“How can I drop it? You were *branded*, William. That means--”\n\n“I know what it means.”\n\n“Fine. What are you going to do about it?”\n\n“I told you, I’m going for a walk. Want to come along?”\n\nJacob looked at him sceptically. They were not really friends as much as similarly aged teenagers, each selected for engineering, that kept pace with each other as they progressed through the program; but that was as close as anyone came to friends. The program demanded so much time and energy it did not leave much for anything but efficient progression. Archaic concepts like friendship were not encouraged.\n\n“It’s your birthday, isn’t it?”\n\n“How’d you know that?”\n\n“Checked you out in the database after the warden branded you.”\n\nWilliam didn’t want to know what other information had been dug up in the regime’s centralized network. He sucked a breath and nodded.\n\n“So, you coming?”\n\n“Why not. You should have some company on your birthday. Lead on.”\n\nThe walk to his secret entrance to the Quarantine was not far. William led them south of the Hub, parallel to the Quarantine perimeter, to a complex of cubed buildings; low-tier residential units for unimpressive graduates of the program. Behind the complex were a series of hills and valleys dense with rusted equipment and broken vehicles, a graveyard of obsolescence that offered many spots to hide from searching eyes. Jacob did not ask any questions as he dipped along with William between the relics of human history that the regime hid from their cities and pretended didn’t exist.\n\nEventually, the boys found themselves in a nook between two hills and the skeleton of a tank, muzzle of its heavy gun pointed past the fence and into into the Quarantine. At the base of the hills, the ground moved down as if falling into a crater. William stood straight from his crouch, confident he could not been seen here.\n\nWilliam braced himself and stepped towards the border.\n\n“What are you doing?” Until this point, Jacob had accompanied William on his walk without complaint. “I hope you’re not planning on going in there.”\n\n“Relax. This place has been dead for ages. We’ll be fine.”\n\n“But the--”\n\n“We’ll be fine, Jacob.”\n\nHe turned back to the tall, linked fence, coils of barbed along its top. Large, square signs were interspersed every hundred feet and warned against entry into the Quarantine. Each bore the regime’s symbol.\n\nOne such sign sat at the lip of the leftmost hill that hid the nook. He placed a foot against the fence and another on the hill, and he shimmied his way up to the sign. When he reached it, he grabbed the bottom corners and lifted it away from the fence, revealing the hole he’d cut years before.\n\nJacob’s face contorted as he watched, trying to speak but only letting loose a grunt. William did not react. To him, entering the Quarantine now felt as natural as breathing, as if he’d trained himself over several years to endure a poison.\n\n“I’m sorry Jacob. I’ve been here before; many times. It’s fine, I promise, but you can go. Thank you for coming this far.”\n\nWilliam looked up into a dark grey sky, like one giant cloud drooping over the city. A storm had blown in and the orange haze from the receding sun had all but gone. Far away, a streak of lightning flashed, and a roll of thunder reached his ears a few seconds later. It wasn’t loud enough to drown out the monotone preaching of the regime that continuously poured out from the loudspeakers placed throughout the city.\n\nJacob stared past William and beyond the fence, to the landscape of destruction beyond, made up of toppled skyscrapers, abandoned vehicles, and other relics from an urban vista lost ot the war. Several kilometres in the distance, the Rift rippled in the air, lingering over the Quarantine. It was dead, now only a monument to the past.\n\n“You’ve been there?”\n\n“More times than I can count.”\n\n“And they don’t know?\n\n“If they did, I wouldn’t be here talking to you.”\n\nJacob smirked. “Fair enough. I guess I could go a little further.”\n\nSmiling, William turned back to his hole and dropped through, and Jacob followed soon after. The other side was immediately different, as if the fence had been erected at the brink of desolation, and the boys navigated their way down into the ruins, taking care not to disturb the ash and rock. Occasionally a drone buzzed overhead and William would motion for Jacob to lay still.\n\nThey continued in this fashion for a long time, making their way towards the centre of the Quarantine, where the Rift shimmered high above. Along the way, Jacob expressed his amazement at broken and dusty artefacts. William remembered being so amazed, but now it just made him calm. Gradually the scattered rubble grew into a maze of shattered infrastructure. He spread his arms and allowed his fingers to trace broken stone while he navigated obstructed roads, and all around him he saw neon streaks of graffiti.\n\nThe graffiti was everywhere, wildly drawn, like autographs of poets who desperately marked their place and their time, and he imagined them crying out:  “Look! I was here!” Now, the poets were gone, forgotten to the passing of years, but their autographs remained. William swelled with joy as he imagined the poets learning that were remembered; then sorrow, as he reflected on his own life, bereft of such an opportunity.\n\nHe kept moving, eyes following the markings, and sometimes amidst the scribbles he saw smaller symbols, concise and uniform. The patterns made his mind wander and he imagined a recreated cityscape teeming with unshackled life that pulsed with creativity. With sadness, he realized the graffiti was all that remained of a past world of hope and freedom, and he would never understand, or appreciate, the meaning behind the symbols that remained.\n\n“Do you feel it, Jacob?”\n\n“Feel what, William?”\n\n“Freedom, I guess.”\n\nHe signalled to Jacob to stop their trek, and they halted near a clearing at the centre of the quarantine, ringed by rubble but otherwise open, sometimes even patched with green. The rift lingered straight above. Jacob had never been this close, and he gazed, awestruck and terrified. They were was at the epicentre of the magicians’ invasion, the final battlefield of the war.\n\nWilliam did not pay attention to the rippling air overhead. Instead, he faced a large slab of limestone that seemed to have fallen from high above and buried itself into the ground without breaking. It was a clean slate, and he would add his own autograph for the ages. The signature would be his and his alone, a memory of his own to add to the lost stories in the quarantine.\n\nHe dropped to one knee and unstrapped his satchel. He reached inside and dug around until he found the piece of charcoal that he’d used to mark his own graffiti on the regime’s skytowers, an act that, if caught, would have sent him for lobotomy. As it happened, the steel walls were not good mediums, and the charcoal markings had quickly blown away in the winds that swept through the city without relent.\n\nThis slab of stone would be different. He dreamed that his mark would last for years. It would be only the smallest of chinks in the Regime’s order, but it would be William’s own, and he imagined himself standing beside the poets and yelling along with them “Look! I did this! It was me!”\n\nHe stood, clutching his charcoal, and approached the stone, but when he stood directly in front of the smooth white surface, he felt suddenly very small. For all his bravado, he couldn’t rise to his moment, and he couldn’t think of anything to draw or any graffiti to tag. He tried to will himself through the block, and he raised his arm and touched the tip of the charcoal to the stone, but his hand just shook. He found he did not have anything to say. The poets of the past had stories to tell, but he had nothing. He was no poet. He squeezed his eyes, bared his teeth, and screamed out into the vacant surroundings, his voice echoing back.\n\nJacob startled but said nothing, though he trembled and kept glancing overhead.\n\nWilliam decided that if couldn’t say something for himself, he would borrow the words. His mind played back to the graffiti he’d passed on the way, and neon scribbles flashed in front of him in rapid succession, so fast they became blurred together into a hallucinated light-show. Then, as abruptly as it had begun, the flickering images froze in his mind, and a single symbol pulsed before him. It was one of smaller etchings, concise and uniform, and different from all the others. It appealed to him for a reason he could not articulate.\n\nHe smiled, his vision filled with the blank stone canvass in front of him. He slowly traced the lines of the symbol that lingered in front of his eyes like an optical illusion. Thick black lines began to take shape on the stone. He took his time. The symbol itself was relatively simple, but he was methodical, wanting to ensure his mark on history was perfect.\n\nThe second that he had finished the symbol, the charcoal residue solidified and began smouldering. He fell backwards in shock. Jacob looked on in horror. The symbol sunk into the stone, then began glowing orange. William could only watch, astonished. A high pitched whine began to fill the air. He scrambled to his feet and ran. Jacob followed. Seconds later, the glowing orange symbol lit ablaze like the sun, and the stone tablet split apart with a crack that could be heard for miles, distinct from the thunder that continued to roll through the sky.\n\nWilliam covered his ears at the sound and fell to the ground, out of breath and confused. He turned his head towards his canvass and saw only fractured rock. But among the remains, a piece of stone was perfectly preserved. It was the area on which he had drawn the symbol. The symbol was no longer glowing, now just faded graffiti, another forgotten autograph. In his peripherals, he saw Jacob pointing to the sky, mouth open with screams unheard.\n\nSirens began blaring before William could make sense of the situation. To his knowledge, never in the last four years had the Regime caught wind of his presence in the Quarantine, but the symbol and splitting stone had drawn their attention.\n\nHe lurched to his feet, grabbed Jacob by the arm, and began to run with all the speed he could muster. Jacob scampered along with him, his face set in shock. They didn’t run fast enough. Spotlights began sweeping the area, appearing with the suddenly circling helicopters, locating the boys with ease and tracking them as they ran.\n\nAt last, William saw an opening within a fallen structure and pointed. Jacob looked and nodded, and they dashed to the side and slipped into the opening. Once inside, they collapsed to the floor, breathless. William rested his head back against the cold concrete. It was no use. They couldn’t escape, and they’d spend the rest of their lives lobotomized and serving soup to the elite atop their skytowers. It was not the birthday he’d wanted.\n\n“Come with me. Now.”\n\nWilliam’s eyes shot open and he gasped, startled. In front of him stood a woman, tall, grey haired. She looked withered, but not from age. Exhaustion, maybe. Her skin was taught over high cheekbones and her lips were pursed.\n\n“Who are you?” He had trouble getting out the words.\n\n“We need to go.”\n\nThe sirens kept blaring, and he now heard dogs barking and yells from their masters as they searched the Quarantine. He had little choice.\n\n“Ok. Let’s go”\n\n“William.” Jacob’s spoke softly.\n\nHe stood and brushed himself off and looked at Jacob. The boy was falling to pieces before his eyes. “It’s her or them.” \n\nThe sounds of barking dogs and yelling men grew closer.\n\n“Choose quickly.” The woman’s voice was stern, but not scalding.\n\n“We’re just kids, in the wrong place and wrong time. They’ll believe us, I know they will. We can start the cycle tomorrow and complete the program. Please.”\n\n“Are you so naive?”\n\nJacob shrunk at the woman’s rebuke. He didn’t respond, but crouched against the wall and pulled his knees close, frozen with indecision.\n\nWilliam thought he heard the scuffling of feet on concrete and knew the searchers had entered the structure. He walked quickly to the boy and grabbed his arm.\n\n“Jacob, let’s go, damnit.”\n\nThe boy did not fight and rose to his feet as William’s pulled him up. The woman turned swiftly and made her way through cracks in the stone. The boys scampered after her, fleeing from their pursuers.\n\nAs they moved deeper, the light that seeped inside began to fade, until William, Jacob, and the woman became consumed by blackness. William reached out to brace against the stone walls and orient himself.\n\n“I can’t see.”\n\n“Shhhh.” The old woman’s response was not comforting.\n\nHe saw a flicker a motion in front of him, and a white light sparked a few feet from the ground. He then saw the woman’s fingers trace a pattern in the air. A small, glowing symbol began to drift in front of the now visible woman. The symbol began to swirl until it coalesced into a ball of radiating light. A corridor revealed itself, and the woman beckoned as she made her way forward.\n\nWilliam did not move. His mouth gaped in astonishment and he clutched the stone around him, terrified.\n\n“Magician!”\n\nJacob’s instincts had been correct, and he cursed himself. But Jacob was too frightened to gloat, his face white with terror. The woman peered at him but did not answer. She beckoned again for the boys to follow through the corridor. Faint sounds of yelling men reached his ears. The regime had not yet abandoned their search.\n\n“Are you going to kill us?”\n\n“No.”\n\nWilliam he steeled himself in the face of the magician, seemingly trapped. He nodded, and pushed forward into the corridor behind the woman. Jacob did not follow. He held his breath, censoring his growing frustration with his companion.\n\n“Jacob, we need to go now.”\n\nThe boy finally spoke, colour returning to his face.\n\n“She is a magician!”\n\nThe woman watched, her eyes twinkling in the glow from the symbol she’d inscribed, now orbiting her body.\n\n“If she wanted us dead, we’d be dead. The regime is coming for us, Jacob. I think we should take our chances with her.”\n\nJacob’s shoulder slumped and he stifled a sob. He pulled his tunic straight to flatten the wrinkles before shooting William a scornful look.\n\n“Going for a walk, huh.”\n\nWilliam squinted and pursed his lips, but took the comment as a good sign. He turned and met the magician’s gaze. She seemed so human. A hint of a smile curled at the corners of her lips and she disappeared through a toppled elevator shaft. They hurried after her without a word.\n\nA long time passed as they navigated their way through the fallen skyscraper. The woman seemed confident in their path, as if she’d walked it many times before. The sirens eventually grew faint, and the air became cooler. William thought they were travelling downwards into the earth, and it wasn’t long before his suspicions were confirmed. The walls changed from stone to compacted dirt and moss.\n\nHe broke the stillness with a question.\n\n“May I ask who are you?”\n\n“You may ask. I may not answer.”\n\n“Ok. Who are you?”\n\nThe woman didn’t respond. He sighed, desperate for an explanation. \n\n“Why were you here, at this spot, and this moment?”\n\n“You’ll have your answers soon enough, young one.” Her words were clipped, but she did not seem impatient. William got the impression that she intended to speak with them eventually. \n\nShe spoke no more, and they made the rest of the journey in silence. After a tiring amount of walking, their journey ended in a small opening barely larger than the standardized apartments in the city. William saw a bed ,and an empty desk, and a large map spread over one side of the room. It wasn’t an ordinary map of scroll and ink. This map hovered above the table, vertically, projecting the depicted landmass in three dimensions. He did not recognize it.\n\nTurning his thoughts to the rest of his surroundings, he could not imagine anyone living this small hole below the earth.\n\n“Is this your home?”\n\nThe woman crossed the room, her strides long and graceful, and sat on the bed with a thud, as if unloading a heavy weight. She looked at William.\n\n“Home? No, this is not my home, but this is where I survive.”\n\n“Survive? You survived the war?”\n\n“Yes, but it was no war.”\n\nHis face scrunched, confused.\n\n“There are several square kilometres of battlefield above our head, and a tear in space and time, that say otherwise.”\n\nThe woman’s lips curled slightly, a vestige of a smile.\n\n“You know much.”\n\n“The regime mandates that the program contains a full account of the magician war, so that order may be preserved: *We must remember the most important moment in human history*.”\n\nEven now, Jacob found an opportunity to show off. But the woman was not amused. Her small smile disappeared in an instant, and she hissed.\n\n“Ah, the regime, with their closed minds and machines. Spare me.”\n\n“You lost; the regime won. Humans won.”\n\nThe woman screamed with hatred. The boys shrunk away from the woman, scared once more. She noticed and bent forward to rest her elbows on her knees, hands clasped and head bowed low.\n\n“I am sorry. The pain is still too near.”\n\nWilliam’s face was stone, and he had no sympathy to spare for a magician. Still, he did not enjoy seeing the woman’s despair. He sought to change the subject, but more to ease his own discomfort than the woman’s.\n\nWilliam pointed at the hovering map, still not believing the magic before his eyes. It appeared to be made of paper, or perhaps vellum, and through it ran shadows of pinkish light. The projected landmass also seemed  to derive from light, green energy that coursed outwards. He marvelled at the intricate details of the map that no pen or printer could ever create. The program’s holographic documentaries had not done magic justice.\n\n“Where is that?”\n\nThe woman raised her head and briefly looked at him before glancing at the map.\n\n“That is Aeyu.”\n\nHe looked blankly at the woman.\n\n“Ay yoo?”\n\n“That’s right.”\n\n“That’s not a real place.”\n\n“I assure you it is real.”\n\n“Right.” William’s let the word drag out and squinted.\n\nThe woman did not flinch. She kept her eyes on him as he slowly started backing up towards the door through which they’d entered, signalling to Jacob to do the same. He had no intention of staying down here with a magician speaking of imaginary places.\n\nThe woman, though, was quick and clever. She flicked her wrist and traced a red symbol in the air. It faded from sight as quickly as it appeared. Nothing happened. William cocked his head, then turned and sprinted for the door. He travelled two steps before crushing his body into a barrier he could not see, then crumpled to the ground, winded. Jacob crashed down next to him.\n\nHis mind reeled and his vision was spotted. The woman appeared above him and bent over, looking directly into his eyes as he stared up at the ceiling, disoriented.\n\n“It is it your birthday?”\n\nHe rolled onto his side and grunted. “What?”\n\n“I asked if it is your birthday.”\n\nExasperated. “Yes, it’s my birthday. How’d you know that?”\n\nThe woman crouched beside him, and he studied her face in detail for the first time. He had thought her an old woman, but now he saw she was barely middle aged. By human standards, anyway. Her greying hair was braided and swept over her left shoulder, and an elongated, silver rune was tucked behind each ear. The lines of her jaw were sharp and her cheekbones high. \n\n“The ability to speak with Aeyu manifests at sixteen years of age. Children are eager for the day to arrive, for that is when we depart for study of the runic language and the ability to write it. It is a great tradition.”\n\n“Speak with Aeyu? You just told me Aeyu is a place.”\n\n“It is.”\n\nHe could not make sense of the woman. Now sitting and rubbing his head, he stated the obvious. “I am not a Magician.”\n\nThe woman smiled in earnest.\n\n“We shall see.”\n\nWilliam glanced up, taken aback. “What?”\n\n“For now, it’s important for you to know that you cannot go back.”\n\n“Go back where?”\n\n“To the Regime, of course. To your Program. To your family, and your friends, if such a thing exists any more, and to your so-called-life. Today was a turning point from which you cannot return.”\n\nHe pulled himself to his feet and steadied himself, still woozy from the impact with the woman’s barrier. When he found his footing, he placed his hands on his waist and stared at the woman, defiant.\n\n“And why is that?”\n\nThe woman stared back to William, and he could feel her conviction.\n\n“Because if the regime learns who you are, they will kill you, and they will kill everyone you love. Make no mistake.”", "timestamp": 1633462855, "digest": "ogGA5C2mfvGT--sE06g4tgMjRef5to-qO02xQLQbMBU", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "lwnURB3AuVQ0IkMHLCzkS8wzwXgRYHr3IXuZDItCrvs", "title": "Chapter One: Aurfell", "body": "Once a year, when the two moons of Aurfell align with its blue sun, the House of Light and Dark unites. It is the Transcendence. The world is shrouded in darkness before giving way to the light. It is a union of the First One’s children—a union of the gods—and it must be celebrated, for once, long ago, the Light and the Dark stood apart, two sides of the Everwar.\n\nTonight, disciples of the House remember the blood of those who came before, and honour what their ancestors became. The disciples—from Acolytes to the Speakers themselves—throw off their silk and cast them into the streets until piles of white and black lay strewn around the city, until they stand bare under the darkening sky. But not for long. They replace their clothing. Now those who belong to the House wear new silk: white on the left, black on the right, with a triangle on the chest. It is split down the middle, and there is an orb at each point.\n\nLumessa is so dressed. A year ago, when she had chosen to walk the path of darkness, the Messenger for this part of the city—a man named Quine, short and fat, with a red nose scarred by time and liquor—had thrust the ceremonial attire into her arms while exclaiming, “Rejoice, for you are saved!”\n\nBut she has never cared about the House of Light and Dark, or its moon worship, and she had wanted to spit in the Messenger’s face. Instead, she had chosen to survive, for all residents of Aurfell must take a path. There is no alternative, and Lumessa had no intention of being evicted from the city and set to wander with the Red-Eyes or skulk with the Demons. So, she had accepted the silk with open arms and a smile, with eyes wide-open.\n\nNow, on the eve of her first Transcendence, she stands with the other Acolytes of her coven on the outskirts of its courtyard. A single banner hangs over the eastern wall. It bears the mark of her coven, a desert crow, and billows just above a raised dais, where the assembly focuses.\n\nLumessa grinds her teeth as she listens to Quine sermonizing. She pulls at strands of her pale-blonde hair while the Messenger rambles on about the horrors of the Everwar and the exodus of the gods, which had brought the first Speakers of Light and Dark together. She grinds the heel of her pointed boot into the loose grains of sand that have blown across the courtyard as Quine praises the peace in Aurfell, and touts the prophecy of the sun.\n\nBut Lumessa is careful with her display, because the Shepherds are always watching. So, it is with a hushed voice that she whispers to the thin girl standing next to her, “We must do this every year?”\n\nSavantha firms her lips, then raises four fingers together and holds them over her eyes. Lumessa’s unwilling partner does not care for her manner. They are not friends, but they are bound. The duality of the House is everywhere—a symbol of the House’s devotion to the prophecy—and every Acolyte is paired with another, meant to walk the path together. *When the twins are one again*… the first words of the sun.\n\nLumessa sighs, perhaps too loudly. A Shepherd cocks a head in her direction and clucks her tongue. It is Shepherd Mara. She is an ugly woman, and stern. The folds of her skin have been cracked by time, but her eyes are sharp. Beads of blood still spot Lumessa’s skin from her last encounter with Mara, and Lumessa’s back aches from where the lashes of a whip have landed too often. She pulls her shoulders back and lifts her chin, but she quiets nonetheless.\n\nThe Messenger finishes his address with a rare prayer to the moons. He looks at the gathered Acolytes, expectation on his face, but there is no applause—not until several Shepherds silently encourage their flock with stern glances and clenched fists. After Quine descends the dais to a smattering of claps, he hurries to a woman who has emerged from the shadows under the fluttering banner. Several figures appear around her. Lumessa peers at them, but settles her gaze on the woman. She is different. She is tall and regal, and her pale face is framed by shoulder-length brown hair that curls around her angled features. There is no triangle on her chest—instead, there is a sphere with swirls inside. The woman is a mage.\n\nLumessa may not believe in gods and fairy tales, but she very much believes in magic—she’s seen it, long ago, and the smell of burning flesh still visits her dreams.\n\n*But why is this mage-woman here*, Lumessa wonders? There is no magic in Lumessa’s coven. It is a simple place, and its Acolytes are destined for labour and menial work. The mark of the desert crow is well known in Aurfell for the toil of its fledgling alumnus. She doubts her coven has produced so much as a Shepherd.\n\nThe woman and Quine seem to be arguing, though the Messenger quickly bows his head and totters away. After he is gone, the mage-woman and her cohort approach the dais. She climbs alone, her steps slow and steady, no sway in her arms, and her posture tight.\n\nWhen she reaches the podium, she rests her hands on each side and stares into a crowd that has gone silent. The quiet lingers, but, before long, nerves get the better of the young boys and girls of the Desert Crows, and their voices begin to creak in confusion. The Shepherds threaten with their presence but do nothing, perhaps equally unsure.\n\nAt last, the mage-woman raises her hand to the onlookers, and, like an unspoken command, the Acolytes quiet in an instant. When the night stills but for the flapping of silk and rustling of sand, the woman speaks.\n\n“Acolytes, my name is Huri. I am the Inquisitor of Darkness.”\n\nLike a crack of thunder, gasps and muted cries ripple among the throng, and the sounds coalesce into a rumble of confusion and awe. Even Lumessa is shocked. There are only two Inquisitors in Aurfell—one light, one dark—and they are the heads of the paths of magic, second only to the Speakers. *Perhaps*, thinks Lumessa, *they are equal*.\n\nInquisitor Huri is not swayed by her reception. Her face is void of expression, and she does not move. Lumessa has never encountered such a powerful figure. The Shepherds may lash their whips, but Lumessa does not fear them. Pain fades, and blood clots. But standing on the dais is a statue, a keeper of the secrets of magic, and an aura of strength drifts through the air. Lumessa finds herself biting her lip and tensing her muscles.\n\nThe Inquisitor speaks again.\n\n“Sons and Daughters of the Dark. Blessed is the Transcendence. Blessed is the union of the two moons and their followers. Blessed in the House, and the peace.”\n\n“*Blessed be!*” comes the response from the Acolytes, in harmony. Lumessa does not think the Shepherds will notice her lack of participation, though Savantha casts her another sharp glance before raising four fingers over her eyes.\n\n“You must find it strange for me to come here,” continues Huri. Her voice is steel. “Your coven is on the edge of the city; your graduates are decent, and hard-working, but not much more. The desert crow is not a symbol found within the Speaker’s Hall, to be sure.”\n\nLumessa stifles a laugh. She knows he Shepherds will bristle, as will the more delusional Acolytes. She warms at the look of horror on Savantha’s face, which shifts quickly to stone when she catches Lumessa staring.\n\n“Yet I am here. I will be put this simply, as is my way: I am searching.”\n\nMurmurs escape the Shepherd’s control, and Lumessa whistles. Savantha flares another look and covers her eyes again, again wishing blindness upon her counterpart.\n\n“That which I seek is beyond your understanding. I will say this, and only this: magic has gone too long without new blood. We have neglected our responsibility to nurture the gods’ gift.”\n\nThe Inquisitor’s voice echoes through the courtyard and lingers in the evening air. Breath unfurls from her lips. Already, the chill begins to set. It will only grow colder.\n\nThe Acolytes do not make noise. They are now hanging off of the Inquisitor’s words. No one knows much about magic, or those who practice it, and the Shepherds discourage gossip. It is not taught in the coven, though whispers seep into open ears like water through cracks in stone. Still, the desert crows are ill prepared to be visited by a mage—the Inquisitor, no less. \n\nLumessa thinks the words are carefully chosen, and her mind races as she tries to understand. She is now as silent as Savantha, and as the others gathered in the courtyard, finally captured in the moment.\n\n“In the coming days,” says Huri, “my mages will visit covens like yours all over this side of Aurfell. I know you’ve not before had the pleasure to keep company with my kin, but I urge you to welcome them, for they are of the Dark, too.”\n\nAn urgency lurks within the Inquisitor’s words. Lumessa hears it. She wonders if others will have as well. The murmurs grow again.\n\n“Prepare yourselves, Acolytes.” Huri is playing with the crowd. Lumessa is enthralled with the speech, but her anticipation fades at the Inquisitor’s next words: “I will find what I seek!” Huri speaks with sudden violence, her steady voice now a rasp, and she pounds a fist on the dais. The air ripples around the point of impact, and a wisp of shadow emerges and begins to coil around the Inquisitor. The shadow is amorphous, without form, yet it moves with purpose, finally settling in a hover over the woman’s shoulders. Two spots are glowing, faintly, from where a head might be, but Lumessa can’t be sure. Her fixation is shattered when the Inquisitor abruptly rips off her ceremonial clothing and stands naked in the cold.\n\nLumessa becomes suddenly aware of the panic surging through the desert crows. Even the Shepherds are mesmerized. Huri stares back into the crowd, shadow on her shoulders, and Lumessa squirms. The woman is frightening, and her intensity cannot be ignored.\n\n“Bring me proper clothes,” Huri demands. A snivelling Quine breaks free from the cohort of mages who stand in the shadows, then rushes over with silk as black as night, his face blanched and eyes wide. *This was not planned*, thinks Lumessa.\n\nThe Inquisitor pulls on the garments, which now include a flowing robe. “Better,” she says. Her voice has regained its calm, as if her display had been ordinary. The wisps of shadow—blackness darker than the night itself, as if a void in the world that eats the light—disappears.\n\n*She flaunts the union on the eve of the Transcendence*, thinks Lumessa.\n\nThe Shepherds are now standing with their mouths hanging open, and they seem oblivious to the growing cacophony in the rows of Acolytes: questions, cries…cheers? Lumessa bites her lip, her discomfort growing.\n\nHuri speaks again, and is calm once more. ”Blessed be the Darkness. Blessed be the desert crows.”\n\n“*Blessed be!*” comes the answer, though less unified than before. Huri abruptly leaves the dais and strides off, becoming invisible almost immediately as her silk blends with the night.\n\nShepherd Mara cracks a whip on the stone of the courtyard, and several Acolytes jump in time to the puff of sand that is raised. Instinctively, the desert crows filter into lines and began a shuffle into the coven. Before she joins, Lumessa peers up into the sky and sees the last flickering of a blue ring as the eclipse begins.", "timestamp": 1633462440, "digest": "D9DRbZhW4lRyuGGaTN-SmmHLKXB8PUqnn1fn8ATaGeg", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}

{"id": "NZiRS5QHxb8GSG2pIFszvBgqzlqzywHYNaoo0lqhFA8", "title": "Chapter One: The Speaker of Runes", "body": "William grew restless and he struggled to focus on the drone of information buzzing from the talking head that floated in front of him, a holographic projection tasked with guiding him through the program. It was talking about the magician war again.\n\nBy now he knew enough about the magicians to elevate to the next cycle, but the curators of the program wanted their participants thinking in lockstep; they did not tolerate a divergence of detail. His eyes wandered to the contours of the projected head and he tried to imagine the technology inside his alcove that brought the speaker to life. The floating head began speaking about human understanding of magic. William smiled at the irony.\n\n*Focus*. His mind was calm. On any other day, he would have panicked at the thought of not being ready for the new cycle, or worse, to be caught distracted. But today, on his sixteenth birthday, he found he didn’t care.\n\nThuds of hardened leather on polished marble floors grew close, and he knew the warden must have entered his aisle, one of many that ran between hundreds of evenly spaced alcoves.\n\nHe’d learned a long time ago to differentiate between administration and elite by their footsteps. Phantom sounds of the clicking of expensive shoes invaded his mind, and he looked to his right to the adjoining, empty alcove where Trevor had sat. The clicking in his mind grew louder, and he squeezed his eyes tight as if he could avoid remembering. He couldn’t, and he watched a vision of Trevor being hauled away by men dressed in black suits, tips of white pocket squares peeking from their breast pockets. Behind them, a white haired man, broad and tall, followed behind with hands clasped behind his back, and the clicking of his shoes faded.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes, he was surprised to see the warden looking down into his alcove and directly at him. The warden wore combat fatigues, grey and white, with shoulder patches that bore the symbol of the regime -  a human, standing with arms akimbo and legs spread, inside of a circle and a square.\n\nHe looked up and met the warden’s eyes, his own carrying a hint of defiance. The warden set his square jaw and glared, bewildered, and spoke firmly.\n\n“What do you think you’re doing?”\n\n William had no response. He continued to stare at the warden instead of engaging with the program. The warden didn’t ask again. Instead, he reached down and grabbed William. With a single jerk of a muscled arm, he was removed from his alcove and slammed face first to the floor at the warden’s feet.\n\nAs he brought himself to his knees, eyes downcast, he was grateful that the warden’s boots were not expensive and did not click. Punishment would be swift, but he would not be dragged away like Trevor, off to be lobotomized.\n\nSearing pain shot through William’s arm as the warden stamped his brand. His skin blistered at the focused heat as it was lasered into his upper arm. It was over in an an instant, but the pain lingered with an intensity that seemed to grow. He’d never before been branded. It would be a black mark on his record, and he’d be unlikely to progress further than the second level cycles. So many years given to the regime - taken by the regime - thrown away in a moment of wayward thought.\n\nWilliam was tossed back into his alcove to re engage with the program, and he did so without hesitation. *What was I thinking?* It hadn’t been his first stray from the regime’s control. He thought of the piece of charcoal sitting in his satchel, and how from time to time he’d scrawl his name upon the base of the nearest skytower. He thought of his sneaking into the Quarantine to walk among the dead. But to openly reject the program and defy the regime, it was beyond foolish.\n\nThe talking head was still preaching. William tuned in, compensating for his behaviour by paying more attention than necessary.\n\n“Scientists postulate that the magicians derive from an parallel universe, and that they’re world exists in the same space and time as Earth. Such theories would explain why they look like us, and talk like us. The universes may be so close that the environment and evolutionary pressures were not dissimilar. ”\n\nWilliam sat straighter and listened in earnest. This information was new, unlike the grand summaries of the war he’d been used to hearing. Possibly the regime was introducing new information at the dawn of a new cycle, an elevated step in the program. His excitement faded quickly as he reached to his throbbing arm.\n\nThe talking head continued. “The practice of magic, of course, is the most distinct of the departures from the same path of selection, natural or artificial, and it remains the grandest mystery from the war.”\n\nLecture stopped soon after, and William spent the duration of the day immersing in the practical application of the program. At birth he’d been selected for engineering, so the panel walls in his alcove were alight with complex equations, radiating electric blue. To answer, he would wave his hands in the air and manipulate them, drawing new lines of light on the panels. Occasionally, when not solving fast enough, numbers appeared in the top right corners of the panels and began to count down. Hurried streaks danced out  his fingers as he raced against time and worked his way through the more difficult equations.\n\nHours later, when the sun began to set and an orange haze settled on this city, the chimes began to sound. He sat back, exhausted, with sweat beaded on his brow. The panels powered down, leaving only inclined walls, seamless and obsidian black, and the floating head snapped out of sight. One of the now dormant panel walls shifted, forming itself into a staircase. He climbed out and joined the ranks of other participants as they shuffled in unison towards the Hub’s exit.\n\nAs he walked, he noticed he was the only standing straight with raised chin, and all around him participants bowed their heads, their faces sullen. He continued to rub his arm as if he could wipe away the regime’s sigil, but the mark would remain, a reminder of his surprising recklessness. *At least the burning will fade*.\n\n“I saw everything.” He hadn’t noticed Jacob had join his side. He stayed silent, eyes fixed forward, and he kept his pace. On a good day, he struggled to bite his tongue at Jacob’s needling. On a day like today, when he needed respite and a place to think, he’d be hard pressed. But to his surprise and relief, Jacob said little else.\n\nThe boys made their way to the Hub’s bottom level and pushed through the crowd that had gathered at the exterior doors, emerging into the cold steel sterility of the regime’s finest city. To the east, at the centre of the city, skytowers soared into the sky, each exactly the same height as the next and evenly spaced. \n\nTheir Hub was built differently, constructed at the city’s edge. It stood only several floors high, but its width spanned several sectors on the grid. The building curved in the shape of an elongated arch, nestled against the border of the Quarantine. Western-facing walls were made of translucent glass, and participants had an unobstructed view of the ancient battleground and the fringe that lay beyond.\n\nWilliam had been gazing into the Quarantine for as long as he’d been a participant, and he blamed the view for his first moment of rebellion. For years he’d been instructed about the desolation within and forbidden from entering, but all he could think about was the silence.\n\nHe remembered his first time, and the stealth he’d conjured to avoid the camera globes mounted at every corner of the city. He remembered cutting through the border fence and finding his way inside, and his first walk amongst toppled buildings and broken cement. Serenity had washed over him, easing his mind from the reality of living in a world devoid of free thought and independence, where every moment of every day was planned with outcomes predicted. Thereafter, every now and then he would venture into the Quarantine as an escape from the program’s daily rigour, even for just an afternoon, or an evening.\n\nTonight, he would visit again. He’d decided to flee into the Quarantine the moment he’d been branded. Even if just for the night, he needed the escape to remain calm and find his balance. *One brand isn’t so bad*. Greater disciplines would be out of reach, but plenty still remained to allow for a comfortable life. If he wanted to ensure a future in the regime of any kind, he’d need to realign and get himself together.\n\n“I’m going for a walk.”\n\nThe sandy haired boy next to him stopped, dropped his satchel to the ground, and placed his hands on his hips.\n\n“What’s going on with you? What was that back there?” Jacob reached out and flicked the brand. William winced and pulled away. \n\n“I don’t know. Got distracted, I guess.”\n\n“You guess?”\n\n“Just drop it.”\n\n“How can I drop it? You were *branded*, William. That means--”\n\n“I know what it means.”\n\n“Fine. What are you going to do about it?”\n\n“I told you, I’m going for a walk. Want to come along?”\n\nJacob looked at him sceptically. They were not really friends as much as similarly aged teenagers, each selected for engineering, that kept pace with each other as they progressed through the program; but that was as close as anyone came to friends. The program demanded so much time and energy it did not leave much for anything but efficient progression. Archaic concepts like friendship were not encouraged.\n\n“It’s your birthday, isn’t it?”\n\n“How’d you know that?”\n\n“Checked you out in the database after the warden branded you.”\n\nWilliam didn’t want to know what other information had been dug up in the regime’s centralized network. He sucked a breath and nodded.\n\n“So, you coming?”\n\n“Why not. You should have some company on your birthday. Lead on.”\n\nThe walk to his secret entrance to the Quarantine was not far. William led them south of the Hub, parallel to the Quarantine perimeter, to a complex of cubed buildings; low-tier residential units for unimpressive graduates of the program. Behind the complex were a series of hills and valleys dense with rusted equipment and broken vehicles, a graveyard of obsolescence that offered many spots to hide from searching eyes. Jacob did not ask any questions as he dipped along with William between the relics of human history that the regime hid from their cities and pretended didn’t exist.\n\nEventually, the boys found themselves in a nook between two hills and the skeleton of a tank, muzzle of its heavy gun pointed past the fence and into into the Quarantine. At the base of the hills, the ground moved down as if falling into a crater. William stood straight from his crouch, confident he could not been seen here.\n\nWilliam braced himself and stepped towards the border.\n\n“What are you doing?” Until this point, Jacob had accompanied William on his walk without complaint. “I hope you’re not planning on going in there.”\n\n“Relax. This place has been dead for ages. We’ll be fine.”\n\n“But the--”\n\n“We’ll be fine, Jacob.”\n\nHe turned back to the tall, linked fence, coils of barbed along its top. Large, square signs were interspersed every hundred feet and warned against entry into the Quarantine. Each bore the regime’s symbol.\n\nOne such sign sat at the lip of the leftmost hill that hid the nook. He placed a foot against the fence and another on the hill, and he shimmied his way up to the sign. When he reached it, he grabbed the bottom corners and lifted it away from the fence, revealing the hole he’d cut years before.\n\nJacob’s face contorted as he watched, trying to speak but only letting loose a grunt. William did not react. To him, entering the Quarantine now felt as natural as breathing, as if he’d trained himself over several years to endure a poison.\n\n“I’m sorry Jacob. I’ve been here before; many times. It’s fine, I promise, but you can go. Thank you for coming this far.”\n\nWilliam looked up into a dark grey sky, like one giant cloud drooping over the city. A storm had blown in and the orange haze from the receding sun had all but gone. Far away, a streak of lightning flashed, and a roll of thunder reached his ears a few seconds later. It wasn’t loud enough to drown out the monotone preaching of the regime that continuously poured out from the loudspeakers placed throughout the city.\n\nJacob stared past William and beyond the fence, to the landscape of destruction beyond, made up of toppled skyscrapers, abandoned vehicles, and other relics from an urban vista lost ot the war. Several kilometres in the distance, the Rift rippled in the air, lingering over the Quarantine. It was dead, now only a monument to the past.\n\n“You’ve been there?”\n\n“More times than I can count.”\n\n“And they don’t know?\n\n“If they did, I wouldn’t be here talking to you.”\n\nJacob smirked. “Fair enough. I guess I could go a little further.”\n\nSmiling, William turned back to his hole and dropped through, and Jacob followed soon after. The other side was immediately different, as if the fence had been erected at the brink of desolation, and the boys navigated their way down into the ruins, taking care not to disturb the ash and rock. Occasionally a drone buzzed overhead and William would motion for Jacob to lay still.\n\nThey continued in this fashion for a long time, making their way towards the centre of the Quarantine, where the Rift shimmered high above. Along the way, Jacob expressed his amazement at broken and dusty artefacts. William remembered being so amazed, but now it just made him calm. Gradually the scattered rubble grew into a maze of shattered infrastructure. He spread his arms and allowed his fingers to trace broken stone while he navigated obstructed roads, and all around him he saw neon streaks of graffiti.\n\nThe graffiti was everywhere, wildly drawn, like autographs of poets who desperately marked their place and their time, and he imagined them crying out:  “Look! I was here!” Now, the poets were gone, forgotten to the passing of years, but their autographs remained. William swelled with joy as he imagined the poets learning that were remembered; then sorrow, as he reflected on his own life, bereft of such an opportunity.\n\nHe kept moving, eyes following the markings, and sometimes amidst the scribbles he saw smaller symbols, concise and uniform. The patterns made his mind wander and he imagined a recreated cityscape teeming with unshackled life that pulsed with creativity. With sadness, he realized the graffiti was all that remained of a past world of hope and freedom, and he would never understand, or appreciate, the meaning behind the symbols that remained.\n\n“Do you feel it, Jacob?”\n\n“Feel what, William?”\n\n“Freedom, I guess.”\n\nHe signalled to Jacob to stop their trek, and they halted near a clearing at the centre of the quarantine, ringed by rubble but otherwise open, sometimes even patched with green. The rift lingered straight above. Jacob had never been this close, and he gazed, awestruck and terrified. They were was at the epicentre of the magicians’ invasion, the final battlefield of the war.\n\nWilliam did not pay attention to the rippling air overhead. Instead, he faced a large slab of limestone that seemed to have fallen from high above and buried itself into the ground without breaking. It was a clean slate, and he would add his own autograph for the ages. The signature would be his and his alone, a memory of his own to add to the lost stories in the quarantine.\n\nHe dropped to one knee and unstrapped his satchel. He reached inside and dug around until he found the piece of charcoal that he’d used to mark his own graffiti on the regime’s skytowers, an act that, if caught, would have sent him for lobotomy. As it happened, the steel walls were not good mediums, and the charcoal markings had quickly blown away in the winds that swept through the city without relent.\n\nThis slab of stone would be different. He dreamed that his mark would last for years. It would be only the smallest of chinks in the Regime’s order, but it would be William’s own, and he imagined himself standing beside the poets and yelling along with them “Look! I did this! It was me!”\n\nHe stood, clutching his charcoal, and approached the stone, but when he stood directly in front of the smooth white surface, he felt suddenly very small. For all his bravado, he couldn’t rise to his moment, and he couldn’t think of anything to draw or any graffiti to tag. He tried to will himself through the block, and he raised his arm and touched the tip of the charcoal to the stone, but his hand just shook. He found he did not have anything to say. The poets of the past had stories to tell, but he had nothing. He was no poet. He squeezed his eyes, bared his teeth, and screamed out into the vacant surroundings, his voice echoing back.\n\nJacob startled but said nothing, though he trembled and kept glancing overhead.\n\nWilliam decided that if couldn’t say something for himself, he would borrow the words. His mind played back to the graffiti he’d passed on the way, and neon scribbles flashed in front of him in rapid succession, so fast they became blurred together into a hallucinated light-show. Then, as abruptly as it had begun, the flickering images froze in his mind, and a single symbol pulsed before him. It was one of smaller etchings, concise and uniform, and different from all the others. It appealed to him for a reason he could not articulate.\n\nHe smiled, his vision filled with the blank stone canvass in front of him. He slowly traced the lines of the symbol that lingered in front of his eyes like an optical illusion. Thick black lines began to take shape on the stone. He took his time. The symbol itself was relatively simple, but he was methodical, wanting to ensure his mark on history was perfect.\n\nThe second that he had finished the symbol, the charcoal residue solidified and began smouldering. He fell backwards in shock. Jacob looked on in horror. The symbol sunk into the stone, then began glowing orange. William could only watch, astonished. A high pitched whine began to fill the air. He scrambled to his feet and ran. Jacob followed. Seconds later, the glowing orange symbol lit ablaze like the sun, and the stone tablet split apart with a crack that could be heard for miles, distinct from the thunder that continued to roll through the sky.\n\nWilliam covered his ears at the sound and fell to the ground, out of breath and confused. He turned his head towards his canvass and saw only fractured rock. But among the remains, a piece of stone was perfectly preserved. It was the area on which he had drawn the symbol. The symbol was no longer glowing, now just faded graffiti, another forgotten autograph. In his peripherals, he saw Jacob pointing to the sky, mouth open with screams unheard.\n\nSirens began blaring before William could make sense of the situation. To his knowledge, never in the last four years had the Regime caught wind of his presence in the Quarantine, but the symbol and splitting stone had drawn their attention.\n\nHe lurched to his feet, grabbed Jacob by the arm, and began to run with all the speed he could muster. Jacob scampered along with him, his face set in shock. They didn’t run fast enough. Spotlights began sweeping the area, appearing with the suddenly circling helicopters, locating the boys with ease and tracking them as they ran.\n\nAt last, William saw an opening within a fallen structure and pointed. Jacob looked and nodded, and they dashed to the side and slipped into the opening. Once inside, they collapsed to the floor, breathless. William rested his head back against the cold concrete. It was no use. They couldn’t escape, and they’d spend the rest of their lives lobotomized and serving soup to the elite atop their skytowers. It was not the birthday he’d wanted.\n\n“Come with me. Now.”\n\nWilliam’s eyes shot open and he gasped, startled. In front of him stood a woman, tall, grey haired. She looked withered, but not from age. Exhaustion, maybe. Her skin was taught over high cheekbones and her lips were pursed.\n\n“Who are you?” He had trouble getting out the words.\n\n“We need to go.”\n\nThe sirens kept blaring, and he now heard dogs barking and yells from their masters as they searched the Quarantine. He had little choice.\n\n“Ok. Let’s go”\n\n“William.” Jacob’s spoke softly.\n\nHe stood and brushed himself off and looked at Jacob. The boy was falling to pieces before his eyes. “It’s her or them.” \n\nThe sounds of barking dogs and yelling men grew closer.\n\n“Choose quickly.” The woman’s voice was stern, but not scalding.\n\n“We’re just kids, in the wrong place and wrong time. They’ll believe us, I know they will. We can start the cycle tomorrow and complete the program. Please.”\n\n“Are you so naive?”\n\nJacob shrunk at the woman’s rebuke. He didn’t respond, but crouched against the wall and pulled his knees close, frozen with indecision.\n\nWilliam thought he heard the scuffling of feet on concrete and knew the searchers had entered the structure. He walked quickly to the boy and grabbed his arm.\n\n“Jacob, let’s go, damnit.”\n\nThe boy did not fight and rose to his feet as William’s pulled him up. The woman turned swiftly and made her way through cracks in the stone. The boys scampered after her, fleeing from their pursuers.\n\nAs they moved deeper, the light that seeped inside began to fade, until William, Jacob, and the woman became consumed by blackness. William reached out to brace against the stone walls and orient himself.\n\n“I can’t see.”\n\n“Shhhh.” The old woman’s response was not comforting.\n\nHe saw a flicker a motion in front of him, and a white light sparked a few feet from the ground. He then saw the woman’s fingers trace a pattern in the air. A small, glowing symbol began to drift in front of the now visible woman. The symbol began to swirl until it coalesced into a ball of radiating light. A corridor revealed itself, and the woman beckoned as she made her way forward.\n\nWilliam did not move. His mouth gaped in astonishment and he clutched the stone around him, terrified.\n\n“Magician!”\n\nJacob’s instincts had been correct, and he cursed himself. But Jacob was too frightened to gloat, his face white with terror. The woman peered at him but did not answer. She beckoned again for the boys to follow through the corridor. Faint sounds of yelling men reached his ears. The regime had not yet abandoned their search.\n\n“Are you going to kill us?”\n\n“No.”\n\nWilliam he steeled himself in the face of the magician, seemingly trapped. He nodded, and pushed forward into the corridor behind the woman. Jacob did not follow. He held his breath, censoring his growing frustration with his companion.\n\n“Jacob, we need to go now.”\n\nThe boy finally spoke, colour returning to his face.\n\n“She is a magician!”\n\nThe woman watched, her eyes twinkling in the glow from the symbol she’d inscribed, now orbiting her body.\n\n“If she wanted us dead, we’d be dead. The regime is coming for us, Jacob. I think we should take our chances with her.”\n\nJacob’s shoulder slumped and he stifled a sob. He pulled his tunic straight to flatten the wrinkles before shooting William a scornful look.\n\n“Going for a walk, huh.”\n\nWilliam squinted and pursed his lips, but took the comment as a good sign. He turned and met the magician’s gaze. She seemed so human. A hint of a smile curled at the corners of her lips and she disappeared through a toppled elevator shaft. They hurried after her without a word.\n\nA long time passed as they navigated their way through the fallen skyscraper. The woman seemed confident in their path, as if she’d walked it many times before. The sirens eventually grew faint, and the air became cooler. William thought they were travelling downwards into the earth, and it wasn’t long before his suspicions were confirmed. The walls changed from stone to compacted dirt and moss.\n\nHe broke the stillness with a question.\n\n“May I ask who are you?”\n\n“You may ask. I may not answer.”\n\n“Ok. Who are you?”\n\nThe woman didn’t respond. He sighed, desperate for an explanation. \n\n“Why were you here, at this spot, and this moment?”\n\n“You’ll have your answers soon enough, young one.” Her words were clipped, but she did not seem impatient. William got the impression that she intended to speak with them eventually. \n\nShe spoke no more, and they made the rest of the journey in silence. After a tiring amount of walking, their journey ended in a small opening barely larger than the standardized apartments in the city. William saw a bed ,and an empty desk, and a large map spread over one side of the room. It wasn’t an ordinary map of scroll and ink. This map hovered above the table, vertically, projecting the depicted landmass in three dimensions. He did not recognize it.\n\nTurning his thoughts to the rest of his surroundings, he could not imagine anyone living this small hole below the earth.\n\n“Is this your home?”\n\nThe woman crossed the room, her strides long and graceful, and sat on the bed with a thud, as if unloading a heavy weight. She looked at William.\n\n“Home? No, this is not my home, but this is where I survive.”\n\n“Survive? You survived the war?”\n\n“Yes, but it was no war.”\n\nHis face scrunched, confused.\n\n“There are several square kilometres of battlefield above our head, and a tear in space and time, that say otherwise.”\n\nThe woman’s lips curled slightly, a vestige of a smile.\n\n“You know much.”\n\n“The regime mandates that the program contains a full account of the magician war, so that order may be preserved: *We must remember the most important moment in human history*.”\n\nEven now, Jacob found an opportunity to show off. But the woman was not amused. Her small smile disappeared in an instant, and she hissed.\n\n“Ah, the regime, with their closed minds and machines. Spare me.”\n\n“You lost; the regime won. Humans won.”\n\nThe woman screamed with hatred. The boys shrunk away from the woman, scared once more. She noticed and bent forward to rest her elbows on her knees, hands clasped and head bowed low.\n\n“I am sorry. The pain is still too near.”\n\nWilliam’s face was stone, and he had no sympathy to spare for a magician. Still, he did not enjoy seeing the woman’s despair. He sought to change the subject, but more to ease his own discomfort than the woman’s.\n\nWilliam pointed at the hovering map, still not believing the magic before his eyes. It appeared to be made of paper, or perhaps vellum, and through it ran shadows of pinkish light. The projected landmass also seemed  to derive from light, green energy that coursed outwards. He marvelled at the intricate details of the map that no pen or printer could ever create. The program’s holographic documentaries had not done magic justice.\n\n“Where is that?”\n\nThe woman raised her head and briefly looked at him before glancing at the map.\n\n“That is Aeyu.”\n\nHe looked blankly at the woman.\n\n“Ay yoo?”\n\n“That’s right.”\n\n“That’s not a real place.”\n\n“I assure you it is real.”\n\n“Right.” William’s let the word drag out and squinted.\n\nThe woman did not flinch. She kept her eyes on him as he slowly started backing up towards the door through which they’d entered, signalling to Jacob to do the same. He had no intention of staying down here with a magician speaking of imaginary places.\n\nThe woman, though, was quick and clever. She flicked her wrist and traced a red symbol in the air. It faded from sight as quickly as it appeared. Nothing happened. William cocked his head, then turned and sprinted for the door. He travelled two steps before crushing his body into a barrier he could not see, then crumpled to the ground, winded. Jacob crashed down next to him.\n\nHis mind reeled and his vision was spotted. The woman appeared above him and bent over, looking directly into his eyes as he stared up at the ceiling, disoriented.\n\n“It is it your birthday?”\n\nHe rolled onto his side and grunted. “What?”\n\n“I asked if it is your birthday.”\n\nExasperated. “Yes, it’s my birthday. How’d you know that?”\n\nThe woman crouched beside him, and he studied her face in detail for the first time. He had thought her an old woman, but now he saw she was barely middle aged. By human standards, anyway. Her greying hair was braided and swept over her left shoulder, and an elongated, silver rune was tucked behind each ear. The lines of her jaw were sharp and her cheekbones high. \n\n“The ability to speak with Aeyu manifests at sixteen years of age. Children are eager for the day to arrive, for that is when we depart for study of the runic language and the ability to write it. It is a great tradition.”\n\n“Speak with Aeyu? You just told me Aeyu is a place.”\n\n“It is.”\n\nHe could not make sense of the woman. Now sitting and rubbing his head, he stated the obvious. “I am not a Magician.”\n\nThe woman smiled in earnest.\n\n“We shall see.”\n\nWilliam glanced up, taken aback. “What?”\n\n“For now, it’s important for you to know that you cannot go back.”\n\n“Go back where?”\n\n“To the Regime, of course. To your Program. To your family, and your friends, if such a thing exists any more, and to your so-called-life. Today was a turning point from which you cannot return.”\n\nHe pulled himself to his feet and steadied himself, still woozy from the impact with the woman’s barrier. When he found his footing, he placed his hands on his waist and stared at the woman, defiant.\n\n“And why is that?”\n\nThe woman stared back to William, and he could feel her conviction.\n\n“Because if the regime learns who you are, they will kill you, and they will kill everyone you love. Make no mistake.”", "timestamp": 1633462855, "digest": "ogGA5C2mfvGT--sE06g4tgMjRef5to-qO02xQLQbMBU", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}

{"id": "S4dFABkQuG8FPcG4fC0239mdp3T1Lwct-EzM3mHSsJg", "title": "Chapter One: Ascension", "body": "Takha peered up into the hazy orange dawn. His eyes traced concentric circle rings running around an otherwise seamless tower that stretched from the ground before him and up into the Sky. He pushed his gaze as far as he could. Images of the Ascended danced through his mind. He imagined they wore all white and glowed under a halo of sunlight. This imagery sprung into his mind like an echo. Of course, he did not really know. He could not. No one could, nor could anyone tell you what really waited for them in the Sky. But everyone wanted to get there and find out. The people in the Muck didn’t know anything else. Everyone born here was raised with an eye to the Sky. Ascension.\n\nToday was Day One of the new Cycle. Takha sat on a slab of shattered stone directly across the street from the tower. His stone. He had sat there at the beginning of every new Cycle for as long as he could remember. His feet no longer dangled below him, kicking in anticipation of the faces that would pass him by on their way to the Passage. He grinned to himself at the memory of his heels bashing into the stone and the bruises left behind. No more. Now, his toes gripped into the ends of his shoes, firmly planted in the reddish dust that lined the streets of the Muck.\n\nThe crowds grew around him in the early dawn of Day One, undeterred by the morning chill. The lack of light in the Muck meant living in a perpetual shadow. Takha was always cold. Everyone was always cold. Yet people with tattered cloths and grimy faces streamed past Takha at his stone perch, chattering and reverberating with an infectious energy.\n\nThere were many hopefuls, and each took their place in one of several lines that had begun forming at different points along the Passage – a ring of panels at the base of the tower. Each line outstretched from a panel, and each line was growing long, like spokes from a wheel. Many more onlookers took root around Takha and beyond Some lay on withered grass and some draped out of their broken apartment. Some just stood in the dusty streets. The onlookers were either too young or too old, and they were either eagerly waiting for their time and their cycle or they were reminiscing about opportunity lost. The Passage would not respond to anyone below sixteen years of age or anyone older than twenty-five. If you didn’t Pass during the time in between you would be stuck in the Muck. Forever.\n\n“Takha! Over here!”\n\nTakha snapped his gaze into focus and followed the voice. He turned his head to the eastern most point of the Passage and saw a hand waving from amidst one of the lines. The hand flowed from a chubby arm that connected to a broad-shouldered boy with black hair and a toothy grin. It was Dento, his childhood friend. Takha smiled. Today was not only Day One of a New Cycle. Today was also Dento’s birthday. His sixteenth birthday.\n\nTakha and Dento were perhaps the most inquisitive of the 235s. They spent the majority of their days immersed in Lore, absorbing knowledge as if water in a desert. They learned of the magic of mathematics and language, the history of their ancestors and the path of the people before, and the wonderment of stories and emotions and what it meant to be human. They solved puzzles and played games. They read books and they wrote poetry. And they harnessed the knowledge that flowed from Lore like mills in a river. To follow this path was to become worthy of Ascension. Takha and Dento spent their entire lives in the Muck learning how to escape from it. And now, one this Day One, Dento would seize his chance.\n\nTakha jumped off his stone and strolled through the crowd towards Dento. Takha’s height was unusual in the Muck. The people were well nourished on account of the supply ships that descended every quarter-cycle. But the lack of light and the denser atmosphere of the Muck caused the people to grow more compact. Gravity. So said the Lore. In spite of this, Takha stood taller than most buy a large margin, so as he worked his way towards Dento he could see all the life bristling around the Passage. Day One was a holy day.\n\nTakha arrived at his friend’s place in line and looked down at the chubby boy. Takha examined the face smudged with dirt, white eyes brimming with fervor.\n\n“Are you ready, Dento?”\n\n“Of course!”\n\n“What is the precise distance from the Muck to the Sky?”\n\n“Easy, Takha. One point three kilometres.”\n\nTakha eyed his friend and remained sceptical. “And the authors of the First Global Constitution?”\n\n“Anderson, Weng, and Denton, if you mean the Monarch Papers; Tandingo and Santiago if you mean the Essays of the Republic. The Honourable Justice Twinfeathers, if you mean the final resolution and confirmation. Be specific, Takha.”\n\nTakha smirked. His friend was ready. One more, though.\n\n“What colour is my shirt?”\n\nThe chubby boy flinched, almost losing grasp of his consuming joy. But he held firm. “Nice try, Takha. You will not take this day from me. You know as well as I that there are too few panels calling a colour test. The odds are good—very good—and I am too happy to wonder on the alternative.”\n\nTakha flashed his own grin. “So be it.” He clapped his hand down on to his friend’s back. “Then this is where we part. I wish you luck, but not too much. It is my turn next cycle, and I shall hope to see you in the rings. Do not ascend without me.”\n\nDento beamed at his friend and waved as Takha retreated back to his stone. The chubby boy turned back to face the base of the Sky Tower and the Passage. The line ahead of him was quickly shrinking. Challengers in front of Dento and all around the Passage were turning away in defeat, crushed and in agony from their failure. The older the potential, the more brutal the despair. The twenty-five-year-olds were the worst, often breaking down and falling to the dusty ground, curled up in fetal positions. A display of utter helplessness. Sometimes Takha could hear a cheer lost amidst the cries, and he would catch a glimpse of a jubilant hopeful welcomed inside the Passage through a suddenly gaping hole where the panel had been. He hoped Dento remained confident.\n\nAt last, Dento’s time came. He stood at the tip of the line, nothing but unyielding blackness stretching to the horizons to each of his sides, and swallowed. He took several unsure steps from his place in line and stopped when he stood just shy of the Passage. Then he waited, but not long. The Passage shimmered before him and hummed into life, immediately displaying several complex equations. They radiated an electric blue and, while Dento could not see the colour, it did not matter for this particular type of examination. He exhaled deeply, relieved there would be no tasks of colour-based pattern recognition. He was secure in his own grasp of quantum mechanics.\n\nDento knew the equations would be visible to all who watched him attempt to secure entry through the Passage, but he refused to allow his nerves to overcome his calm. Instead, he began to wave his hands in the air, manipulating the symbols before him and drawing new lines of light on the panel. Time passed slowly and sweat beaded on Dento’s forehead. Eventually, numbers appeared in the top right corner of the panel and began counting down. Dento’s test was drawing to a close, one way or another. Dento squeezed his eyes and chewed his lip and struggled to find a solution. But, with little under a minute remaining in the examination, everything clicked in Dento’s head. He waved his arms in a flurry and then abruptly stopped.\n\nLights pulsed on his panel of the Passage, indicating a correct solution. The onlookers saw the blue lines of light turn green, and before Dento could himself react there was an eruption of jubilation that overcame him from behind. When realization swept over Dento and he finally did react, he fell to his knees under the weight of emotion. The panel in front of him winked out of existence and pulsed again with a white light around edges of a newly formed doorway, beckoning the successful ascendant to enter. Dento cried softly to himself and rose to his feet, slowly making his way into the tower and the beginnings of his Ascension.\n\nTakha had been watching from his atop his shattered stone. He had followed along with every wrong presumption and incorrect calculation. He had silently celebrated when Dento stumbled upon the corrections and worked his way to a solution. And he had mourned the closing of his lifelong friendship. Even if Takha made it past the Passage on his own Day One, he was not sure he would ever see Dento again. The concentric rings lining the Sky Tower were many, and broad, and Takha thought there were many steps to take along the path.\n\nLost in contemplation, Takha slipped away from his stone and made his way back to the Library and to the Lore, his mind firmly fixed on the next Cycle.\n\n \\n \n\n ", "timestamp": 1633463073, "digest": "jsk00xAY3IWIs50ppCLkuRWHEDTpxl4xCkcQ6FWJj_8", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "sPPJ3SbVJM1g2LhXPpjuddef3jSuCplGoKrQbfYBb8A", "title": "Chapter One: Shadowdancer", "body": "Izak woke up while falling from the sky, and he could not seize the wind to slow himself. He pulled at the threads of the air and commanded it to slow his descent, but it would not listen. So he fell, and kept falling, and the ground filled his vision until he saw nothing else but his impending death. It would come too soon for him. He’d only just graduated from the Trials. Years of hard work—of sweat and tears—would be wasted. In the fleeting seconds he had left, his mind filled with hatred—for the wind, and for its little masters who would not hear Izak’s call.\n\nAnd then a strange thing happened. His descent slowed, and the rush of the air that had filled his ears died away. His body righted itself until his feet were beneath him, and then he floated the remainder of the way to the ground, like an autumn leaf on a breeze, until he set down in the middle of a clearing.\n\nTall grass surrounded him—pale green, almost yellow, like the fluttering ribbons that hung throughout the Ferundi territories—and the pink hues of the second sun painted the horizon.\n\nImmediately after he landed, Izak ducked low and crawled into the grass in a bid to hide himself. The wind still would not answer. It terrified him. When was the last time he’d been unable to summon the Naiads, he wondered? The Naiads’ silence screamed in his mind, perhaps as loud as the confusion that engulfed him.\n\nHe didn’t know this place. It was still Ferundi lands, yes, but nowhere like he’d seen, or like he’d heard about, during all of his travels and studies. The lake south of him should not have existed, for the seasons had run so dry for years on end. To see a body of still water—especially one so large—defied everything he knew about the world. To the east he saw a mountain range. It was so close he could trace the contours of its foothills as they rolled over the plains. Perhaps they were an outcropping from the other side of the Banna mountains, but no maps he know revealed territory to the west, nor any paths to venture upon to get there.\n\nIt took only a few moments of wayward thought over his whereabouts before Izak turned his inquiry upward, to the sky.\n\nHow? Why?\n\nSitting in the brittle grass, Izak bit his tongue to stop from sobbing. Devotion to the Naiads did not allow for weakness; they would not respond to the meek. It had been his first and most important lesson as he navigated the Trials, one imparted long ago by a woman far wiser than him. She was a professor—the professor—of the Zoren, and her face drifted into Izak’s vision. He tried to push the sight away, and he shouted into the still of the morning: “I am not weak!”\n\nHis voice sounded through the valley. It was a mistake. Suddenly, there was a rustling in the grass. Not the sound of movement like the echo of a breeze, but more violent—purposeful. Izak did not like it, so he jumped to his feet and ran into the clearing and away from the grass, turning to face what was coming and instinctively reaching for the wind. He found nothing. He was helpless. The Naiads had abandoned him, and had been left to die alone.\n\nBut he again avoided his fate, for a girl emerged from the grass, gasping for air as she tried to catch her breath. The fear upon her face eclipsed the fear surging through his body, and when she laid eyes on him she began weeping. Her tears flowed freely and fell to the ground. Izak stood there, struck silent and flustered, until the girl fell to her knees. Only then did he move—toward her, not away.\n\n“Why are you crying,” he asked. It was an odd sensation to feel compassion in that moment. There in the grass, lost and scared and unable to feel the tingle of a connection with the Naiads, his mind had reached for a shred of humanity to right himself. Yet he remained aware of his vulnerability.\n\nThe girl sniffled. “They’ll find us,” she said. Izak came closer, then sat on his heels and looked the girl in her eyes—crisp, violet eyes that danced. Izak restrained his shock. She was a firebreed. Izak’s instinct urged him to pull away, but he resisted. Us, she had said.\n\n“Who will find us?” he asked, but she shook her head. Izak threw more questions at the terrified girl: “Why am I here? Where are we?” His anxiety rose again, and the noises around him awoke, his senses no longer deafened by the fall and the fear. He heard the howling in the distance for the first time. A storm would come—soon. It would swirl inwards from the horizon, like all storms, culminating in a vortex that would last through the night.\n\nIzak reassessed his surroundings. It was imperative to find shelter, and quickly, and then to double-back at the right moment. Dodging storms was ingrained into him—a natural truth, like breathing. But there were other worries at the moment, and he needed to understand.\n\n“Listen to me.” Izak did not want to push the unstable girl, but she would not listen. “Listen!” He gripped her shoulders. “We need to leave. Do you understand?”\n\nShe nodded, and her autumn hair swished as she rose to her feet. Izak stood with her, and then they faced each other at full height. The girl’s composure seemed to return. Her tears had stopped flowing, and her lips no longer trembled. She raised her arm, slightly, and offered her hand. Izak grabbed it, and the girl immediately tugged; together, they ran through the grass and toward the forest.", "timestamp": 1633462643, "digest": "gPc8WfeHZqEL8FiL1_e6mPAELy7RtUgwShIW6jTAulY", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "wB2LvvhS2dzeO-ypSmpwAsVK9rYvvjFuJqyBk8d49OI", "title": "Chapter One: Valour and Virtue", "body": "Fires burned from torches held high by the soldiers who’d survived the night. They stood at attention, sadness in their eyes, faces blackened and bloodied, bodies broken and scarred. But they lived. Those who lay atop the pyres did not.\n\nMorning came with a chill, the kind blown in over water, but the forces of Duneld did not waiver; they guarded their fallen, and would until the flames took them, as was the way.\n\n“Shouldn’t you be down there with your brother?”\n\nMairi pulled up her cloak to turn away the brittle wind and faced her mother, whose voice had been filled with judgment. Her mother did not keep secret her disdain for her daughter’s path.\n\n“It is not my place, Mother.”\n\n“You fought among them, did you not?”\n\nViolence took Mairi’s vision. Black blood had spilled across her edge as she had sliced it through the dark things that had come for them. It had washed over her, a torrent of death for which she’d prepared, but never enough. She tasted it still, like a festering poison. \n\n“Willyem is their Grey.”\n\n“Aye,” said Flora Duneld, matriarch of the clan. “He is there Grey, but you are his sister, and you have chosen the path of valour” She stepped out from the shadows and joined her daughter at the crest of the battlements overlooking the tattered Skyreach Fields—once rolling mounds of luscious green, now a charred and stained memory.\n\nMairi bristled but kept composure, letting out a slow breath. She watched it curl upward in the frosted air, and then fade away amidst the fog. “Still, Mother?”\n\nFiora gripped the chiselled-stone railing, and her knuckles whitened beyond her already-pale complexion. Fury burned behind brown eyes, concealed only slightly by her picture of beauty, marked by a perfectly oval face around which fell long, raven-black hair.\n\n“Still, my daughter. Your path was to be virtue.”\n\n“But I am not virtuous,” said Mairi.\n\n“That never mattered.” Her mother spoke as cold as the morning. “Valour and virtue is the way. It has always been the way. What will the clan do now, daughter?”\n\nMairi watched the solemn vigil taking place at the base of their hold. She admired the strength in the silence of the valiant few who remained to fly their colours. Willyem had emerged from the gates, and all eyes followed his slow march between the rows of pyres. He would visit them all—hundreds of them—to say a quiet word known only to him and the dead.\n\nShe reached up and played with the iron clasp holding tight her ceremonial cloak, patterned white and black, inscribed with the old words: “Valour and virtue.”\n\n“Mother,” said Mairi, “you shepherd this family; you lead this clan. No one could do justice to our interests better.”\n\n“I won’t be here forever, Mairi. What then?”\n\nBelow, Willyem continued delivering the last rights to the fallen, his white and black cloak billowing around him as he walked. Her brother had always been statuesque, like a hero from history born anew. But not even he could face the wars to come without help.\n\n“First there must be a forever,” said Mairi. “Father knew what was coming, and he trained me to fight, not to—“\n\n“Your father is dead!” Fiora seethed, still beautiful. “The path of valour is romantic, I know. The annals are full with legends of those who risked everything for glory, or honour, or whatever captured their fancy at the time. Many found success; many did not. But they are all dead, my love. It is we, the virtuous, who live on and carry forth family name.”\n\n“He needs my help,” said Mairi. “And when we unite the clans and save the island from dark hours, we will do so in the name of Duneld, and history will know.”\n\nFIora released her grip on the railing and stepped back into the shadows. “I hope you are right, Mairi. I hope you and Willyem accomplish all that you set out to do. But if you fail, my daughter, what will history have to say about us then? Perhaps nothing at all.”\n\nAfter her mother had left, Mairi remained alone in quiet observation of the vigil. Though tormented by her decision to pursue valour, and her mother’s words, she found herself resolute. Teeth gritted, she braced against the cold but did not move, and she stilled herself as best she could. Though she had no torch, she would guard the dead until the flames took them, as was the way.\n\nThe morning passed slow, and her brother’s march took time, but she did not move. She did not take her eyes away from her Grey, the boy with whom she’d grown right here in the Hold—the man who carried her father’s edge and who inspired love in all those who followed him. She would follow, too, for she was a valiant of Clan Duneld. That was her path.\n\nWillyem walked back to the base of the Hold where the soldiers stood, their torches still raised high, still flickering in the frost. He drew his edge, then he planted in in the rocky mud.\n\nHe spoke aloud, to no one in particular, and his voice carried far. “The night has ended. Then sun has risen. Breath fills our lunges. Blood runs in our veins.” He paused, then looked up and behind him, to where Mairi stood, still as stone. Their blue eyes met, but they shared no smile.\n\nHe pulled away his gaze and continued his sermon. “We live, aye, but our brothers and sisters fell, never to wake. They fought hard. They fought true. They lived and die for the clan. Our clan. Remember them, so their names might live forever.” Willyem readied his torch. “May they pass in peace. May our ancestors receive them. Valour, and virtue.”\n\nThe silent monoliths who stood at attention behind their Grey in unison thumped a fist against their chest and called out in one great voice: “Valour, and virtue!”\n\nThe sound echoed in the morning, and then all was serene once again. Willyem lowered his torch to the ground and lit the first pyre. His signal accepted, others moved forward and lit pyres, until they all began to burn, a great fire stretching into the horizon. The flames filled Mairi’s brown eyes, and she whispered to herself: “Valour, and virtue.”\n\n \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n \n\n“I thought I’d find you here.”\n\nMairi approached her brother, who at the edge of Wave’s End, the lake stretching from the northern sea to the edge of Cloudhold, clan Duneld’s family home. Wind was ever-present in their part of the Great Isle, and now it was gently pushing the water to the shore so that it lapped over the rocky beach. She loved the sound. This type of day had always been her favourite, back when she was innocent, and had not seen the things she had, nor done the things she had.\n\n“Father was right.” Without looking at his sister, Willyem spoke in the same distracted manner as at the vigil, as if he saw something over the water she could not. Perhaps he did. Perhaps that’s why the valiant chose him as their Grey, discarding the older, wiser, more hardened men who’d sought the head of the Duneld forces.\n\n“About what, Willyem?” She stood at his side now, her head stopping at his broad shoulders. She looked out over the water to look for what he saw, but found nothing but more water.\n\n“The eternal war,” he said. “That we are the shield.”\n\nMairi sighed, and her brother noticed.\n\n“Even after last night, and you don’t believe,” he said. It had not been a question.\n\n“I know what I saw, Brother.”\n\n“What did you see?” he asked. “I’ve been trying to describe it to myself, but I cannot find the words.”\n\nMairi again tasted black blood that had filled her mouth as she had bathed in chaos of dying men and women and… things. In the dawn, after she had crawled out from the muck, life clinging to her ragged self, she had drenched herself with steamed and perfumed water, and she had scrubbed herself raw, until her skin was red and her soul bare. Still, the vile remained with her. She couldn’t imagine ever being clean again.\n\n“I saw *them*,” she said. “Just as father foretold. Just as the tomes beneath the Hold caution. Just as the carvings at Old Rock depict.”\n\n“Aye,” said Willyem. “It was them. They died all the same.” One of his hands rested atop the handle of his edge hanging from his waist. He placed the other around his sister’s shoulder. “I saw you, Mairi, fighting. You have fire in you. Father would have been proud.”\n\n“Mother isn’t.”\n\nWillyem laughed, in his way. The hint of a smile played at his lips, and his eyes twinkled, but he stayed quiet, and his face did not move. “She only wants the best for our clan. A *future*, for our clan.”\n\n“I am no lady of virtue, Brother.”\n\n“No,” he said. “But you’re a daughter of Duneld all the same. There have always been two paths, Mairi. The clan needs both to survive.”\n\n“Virtue would not have survived the night.”\n\nWillyem bowed his head, then crouched. He reached for the lapping lake-water, and allowed it to flow over his ungloved finger. “I suspect not,” he said. “But virtue will lead us through many more.”\n\n“The other clans,” said Mairi.\n\n“Aye,” said Willyem. “The other clans.”\n\n“But you said it yourself, *we* are the shield. No other clan built their castles at the edges of the water; they’re all inland, Brother.”\n\n“Now we know why.”\n\nMairi stood quiet with her brother for some time, both looking out toward the mouth of the northern sea, from where dark things had come in the night. She walked closer to the shore.\n\n“Do you remember when we were children, Willyem? When we would dance in the water for hours and hours, splashing each other, racing from edge to edge, laughing until mother called us for dinner.”\n\nHe nodded. “Aye. I remember.”\n\n“Come,” she took off her boots and waded into the lake, reaching back to him. “Let us dance one last time, before the end of the world.”\n\nWillyem stared at her, his round eyes brilliant blue, like hers—like their father’s. She saw pain within them, and the same lingering sadness he always carried.\n\n“Mairi,” he said. “Dancing and splashing and racing and laughing…these are the actions of the innocent, and the joyous, and the free.”\n\n“Are we not those things, Brother?” She found herself pleading.\n\n“None of us are. Not any more.”\n\nThe cold of the lake hit her just then. It sunk beneath her skin and travelled through her body, until her spine chilled and heart numbed.\n\n“We deserve to be,” she said.\n\nWillyem pulled his eyes from hers and looked past her, toward the emptiness of the horizon, toward the same unknown she could not see.\n\n“When the time comes,” he said, “let us hope there is more mother in you than father. Not all of the clans will unite under valour; it will take virtue, too.”\n\n“Aye, Willyem,” she said. “Let us hope.”\n\nHe turned from her, standing alone in the lake, and began to walk back to the Hold. “Tomorrow, we ride for Clan Quarry. Let us begin there.”\n\n \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n \n\nWhen they left the next day, the ground shook beneath the feet of a thousand pairs of marching feet. None of the valiant men and women of Duneld who remained after the long night of terror had protested their new duty. None complained of weariness. None begged reprieve. Honour commanded their hearts as much as love of clan and country.\n\nCountry. The Great Isle. Home to many names and many stories—most marked by blood. How many years had it been, Mairi wondered, since war had broken out among the clans? It was all she knew. It was all she’d learned. Had it always been this way, or had there been a peace, long ago?\n\nShe walked beside her brother and the tip of the spear that was the valiant of Duneld, edges hanging from the belts, cloaks around their shoulders, banners at their backs. For a little while, they walked without interruption or distraction. Only the sounds of the Great Isle played in their ears, a counterpoint to the thundering march. Then it began to rain.\n\nDroplets pattered off steel and soaked leather, and the black hair of Willyem and Mairi Duneld dampened until it clung to their faces. She smelled sulphur lingering from a thunderstorm long past—or was it on its way?—and the emerald grass beneath their feet became soft and matted.\n\n“Clan Quarry is small, Brother, and Oathkeep is tucked away far to the east.”\n\n“Aye,” he said. “So they are; so it is.”\n\n“Why begin there? Their influence is light; they matter not in the grand scheme.”\n\nWillyem pulled himself up over topple rock from an age long past, then reached to his sister to help her. “Is that what mother says?”\n\n“She may have mentioned it a time or two when discussing clan politics.”\n\nHe looked at her. “Since when do you pay attention to politics?”\n\n“I haven’t always walked this path, Brother.”\n\nThunder sounded in the distance, from the direction in which they travelled. The storm would be upon them soon.\n\n“I suppose not,” he said. “Tell me, Mairi, do you know the Quarry home is called Oathkeep?”\n\n“I don’t,” she answered.\n\n“Legends say Clan Quarry was once mighty, spanning the entire coast, led by a man of great revere.”\n\n“Legends?” she asked.\n\nWillyem looked at her. “Father.” He continued. “There was to be a great battle, perhaps the greatest the Isle has ever seen, and the ancestors of Duneld needed aid. You’ve heard of Mulcom?”\n\n“Of course,” she said. “We bear his words on our crest.”\n\n“Aye,” said Willyem. “Mulcom approached the Quarry for an oath—an oath to come to their call when the battle came to Duneld.”\n\n“Why would the Quarry agree?”\n\n“Don’t know,” said Willyem. “But they did. And they kept their oath. In return, Mulcom gifted them the castle now called Oathkeep.”\n\nMairi didn’t know what to say. All of this information was new to her—something never told when she had learned the history of the Great Isle and of its clans. And perhaps she was more shocked to hear her brother speak of things other than steel and iron and blood.\n\n“If the legend is true—if *father* was right—the years have not been kind to Clan Quarry.”\n\n“No,” said Willyem.\n\n“You think they’ll stand by an oath pulled from history?”\n\n“Maybe not,” he said. “But there is open war between the clans. Nowhere is safe on the Great Isle—less so now. Only the Quarry stay tucked away, as you said; only the Quarry have no sides to choose.”\n\n“What of their own side?”\n\nWillyem thought for a moment before giving his reply. “If they choose their side, that is their choice. But we have to try.”\n\nAnother crack of thunder resonated, louder than before, and the rain began to fall harder. Mairi pulled up her hood to shelter herself. Her brother did the same.\n\n“Do you think they’ll believe us?”\n\n“About the dark?” he asked.\n\n“About them, about everything. To see is to know. We know.”\n\nHe looked over his shoulder at the marching valiant, then met her stare. “I wouldn’t. They won’t.”\n\n“No, I don’t suppose they will.”\n\n ", "timestamp": 1633461002, "digest": "wIFNyAkxt0DevWRQDBZ_P6Qk3R5JDbh7waALTK2E7Io", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "WwnSG6Xm6xosp8o7RxFfpJJGNtHGRypPvNbt0fLCsyU", "title": "Chapter One: The Showdown", "body": "\"Not far now,” I yelled over my shoulder. Pa lay drunk in the wagon rolling behind the horses I guided, laid out from two pints of gut warmer drained before noon. Left me to finish a drive alone again. One cowboy, two hundred heads, and there’d be hell to pay if any disappeared. Pa’s been for certain about pulling in more pieces.\n\nI pulled my shadowmaker lower on my face, squinted into the sun-drenched horizon past hoodoos sprouting from the badlands, and chewed at a piece of straw. It didn’t taste like anything, but kept my mouth wet with saliva and tricked my mind. Can’t remember where I picked up the habit. My skin had long ago darkened and tightened from the everyday sun, and long, wavy black hair had turned brown and flattened.\n\nNot many drove the Old Road. No fresh grass or fresh water this way, and dry heat sucked moisture from bone. Wasn’t any shorter either, still a week’s ride to Junction, the first border town to the east. Not even marshals roamed this far from Homestead. Something else brought cowboys over the desert. Freedom. Liberty from the Syndicate and the gallows, no hangin’ for using what burned within.\n\nA kick of my heels spurred Marrow to a slow trot along the cracked, dusty trail slowly funnelling between two cliffs. I passed a section of scorched rock, eyes following a wave of black growing higher and wider. Stretching from my saddle, I reached out and dragged fingertips against the surface. Sparks flickered and faded, the still air broken by sizzles and hisses. I gazed at the blue fire glowing through but not burning my saddle gloves, an ever-present itch just beneath my skin begging to be set free. The Blaze. Wicked, but powerful, even then urging me to wield the flame. But I didn’t.\n\nDaylight slipped away, and I managed to drive the herd to Junction without issue, no need to draw upon the Blaze. The cattle marched quiet over a crest of rock and down until the ground turned to yellow, brittle weeds and prickle shrubs barely moving a breeze blown in by the dusk.\n\n“Evenin’, ma’am.” A farmer walked besides, hauling a bundle of harvested corn.\n\n“Evenin’.” Kept chewing my straw, staring straight ahead. Too many faces in my life, coming and going through the Outskirts. Didn’t need another.\n\n“Quite the shadowmaker you got there. Never seen one like it.”\n\n“That right?”\n\n“Would pay a good share of pieces for it.”\n\nI pulled on Marrow’s reins and stopped, turned my head and glared down at the farmer. My shadowmaker used to be Ma’s, quick as she was. One day she’d not been quick enough. With her last breath she had told me to wear it well, make her proud. Wore it every day since, though I wasn’t no fighter and likely never would be—not if I spent my days driving cattle. Pa had tried to take the shadowmaker from me once, probably for sellin’—the famous shadowmaker of Giddy O’hare—but I had fought back something fierce. That day I discovered the Blaze. Pa never tried again.\n\n“It ain’t for sale.” I put ice and poison into my words, easy for a cowboy. The farmer took the hint and hurried away, circled wide around the herd now marching well ahead of me. Several other labourers scurried back to town, sometimes shifting heads and casting glances my way. Not many came by the Old Road, and those who did, like her, brought trouble.\n\nPa roused by the time the horses and wagon rolled up to the town’s gates, shaking his head and spitting the leftovers. No praise, no gratitude for lining his pockets, but I didn't expect any. Ten years since my first drive, and never a word of encouragement or smile. Just work. Pa didn't even pony for any new gear, and I spent most of my pieces getting equipped. Most. My fingers traced the single piece sitting my pocket. The beginning of my way out. \n\nI nodded the brim of my shadowmaker at locals slack-jawin' at our entrance, just two cowboys and a two hundred heads. Gates opened, allowing me and Pa to steer the cattle inside, set to eating grass and standing around. We sauntered into the town like black thumbs, gawked and pointed at by old folk and youngins’ walkin the streets. Not too many cowboys came this way, only once in a while. More pieces for less work in the Core. Junction and its folk settled on the inner perimeter of the Outskirts, or the outer edges of the Core, depending on how you looked at it. Close enough to attract trade, get fed, but too far to earn respect, be protected. The Syndicate didn't care about towns like these. If bandits came, they came, and people moved on. Life on the brink, some called it.\n\nAlways looked forward to drives to border towns. The people shined brighter, played harder. Maybe that's why Pa took more contracts in these parts, never hard to find a game of vapour, far enough away from roaming marshals to gamble without fear of the gallows.\n\n\"Where's the saloon?\" Pa shouted at a milkmaid cleaning her bottles under the water tower, spittle dripping down his chin and almost keeling over. The milkmaid soured and pointed to a three-story building nested between a smith and post office. Pa grunted, shook his reins and headed that way. I followed, but cast a sympathetic look to the woman, used to cleaning up after Pa's indiscretions.\n\n\"Stay here, Ellie,\" said Pa, dismounting and stumbling his way inside. I sighed, readied for a long night of waiting for Pa to lose his pieces and pass out with a belly full of whiskey.\n\nEven at the evening hour, people worked. Not just piano players and dancers in the saloon, flickering light and laughter escaping the swinging doors. Outside, the smith hammered iron, forged by intermittent streaks of blue fire from his fingertips illuminating the registration papers hanging from his stall, clangs ripping the air and echoing into the night. Several folk tended horses tied up to posts, lumped straw beneath their stouts and filled buckets, and lit candles near their droppings, the mix of smells confusing my nose.\n\nBut the jewel of the evening lay with the Showdown. The Syndicate may not operate on the brink, but the Showdown circuits came this far and further, even to the edges of the Outskirts. Nothing fancy this far out, nothing wild like in the stories from Homestead, and no heroes or legends. Just plain old draw and shoot. Men and women, boys and girls, cowboys and charlatans, farmers and other folk, all roped into the border circuits by some misfortune or another.\n\nWhen I saw the ring, the gathering of voyeurs around an erected platform, I rushed to the barricade around its edges and found an open space, stepped up on the wood and braced arms over, eager to glimpse the next draw.\n\nInto the opening walked a man, wide steps and jingling boots, white ten-gallon on his head and a bristly moustache below his nose. Forty? Fifty? The wrinkles in his skin stood out despite the dusk. The fighter didn't bother to engage the crowd, focused only on the woman twenty paces away. She wore a striped barmaid's dress, red top, black bottom, frilled and puffy, and blond hair pulled up in a bun. An entertainer, she took time to walk around the barricade and drag a fingertip over the lips of howling locals, then pulled it away, revealing a tiny gleam of blue fire.\n\n\"Folks, tonight the Showdown offers you a fight for the ages.\" The announcer standing in the middle of the platform grabbed the crowd's attention, his words inflected and urgent. \"First, a veteran of the circuits, born and raised a fighter, Blaze like you've never seen, I give you Jacob,\" the announcer elongated his next words, \"Two-Twin Jacobs.\"\n\nI pumped a fist as the rest of the onlookers cheered. Two-Twin was a veteran all right. In every town, I zealously sought information on the Showdown, heard tell of duels near and far, and so I recognized his name. Never seen him fight before, though. Never even seen a bounty poster, no wanted signs for a career fighter in the border towns.\n\nMy excitement faded quickly at the sounds of drunken gamblers pouring from the saloon. Pa used to love the Showdown, travel all around and watch Ma fell men twice her size. He had inspired my passion years ago, long before he lost himself to whiskey. Now Pa barely bothered, bristled at a mention.\n\n\"And his challenger, a local, you knew her well, stealer of hearts and pieces, life of barmaid in the saloon, now making her mark with her Blaze, it's Miss Poppy!\" The crowd roared louder, euphoric with their Junction fighter. \"You won't see this again for a hundred turns, I guarantee it. Bet those pieces, place your wagers, pony up if you're so sure. Who will it be, old and steady or young and unpredictable? The clock strikes soon.\"\n\nThe gamblers yelled in unison. Five pieces on the old man! Ten on the wench! Bet he downs her with one shot! Not a chance, sun sets for the old man! Pieces traded hands, flicked in the air, exchanged for slips of paper. Coins rattled in saddlebags and pouches. The commotion almost drowned out shouts drifting from the saloon, where no doubt Pa's game of vapour grew serious.\n\nI frowned, just one piece in my pockets, residue from the last drive. I needed the piece, the first step towards something else, more than driving cattle between holes in the ground. Heard tell of a Showdown gang up near Tallhill, could buy in for training and all that. But the evening air blew different, shooed my caution. Would be a long time until Pa and I made it out west again, or anywhere near Tallhill. And stakes put the barmaid ten to one, offered a jump start toward my something else when I finally got there. New blood and an old man who didn’t look his legend. Seemed clear to me.\n\n“I’ll put a piece on Poppy!” I flipped the metal in the air to the passing bookmaker, who caught it and handed me a slip confirming my bet. I clutched it to my chest and looked up and across the square to the town clock.\n\nLess than one minute to the hour. Two-Twin and Miss Poppy stared at each other, oblivious to their surroundings, hands by their sides, index fingers extended from balled fists and thumbs stretched out. No regulators on their fingertips, no rules out here. The quicker draw took the day, the slower dead to rights and left to mercy. Sometimes they got it, and sometimes they didn’t. Life on the brink.\n\nA crow hovered above, its caw clear and crisp. The frills of Miss Poppy's dress billowed in a faint breeze, and Two-Twins lip twitched, his moustache moving in unison. Silence fell about the crowd until only the ticking clock cut the evening. I heard my breath, squeezed a gatepost and leaned forward, afraid to blink.\n\nChime. The fighters reacted at once, too fast to perceive. Two-Twin snapped his hand from his side and pointed his extended index finger at Miss Poppy, the hint of a flame at his fingertip. He pushed his thumb down, a trigger, and his Blaze combusted with a sharp, loud crack. Blue fire shot toward Ms. Poppy in narrow, parallel beams, straight as a blade. But the barmaid pivoted in a circle at the chime, feet shuffling, frills raised and twirling, until she came back around and faced Jacobs. The twin beams singed her puffy blouse but missed their mark. As she finished her rotation, in one fluid movement, she clapped her hands together, index fingers side by side, cracking the air louder as her Blaze ignited, unleashing a rippling stream of blue fire, more flat than tall. It caught Two-Twin in the chest and knocked him ten feet back and to the ground, crumpled against the side of the barricade.\n\nThe gamblers roared, deafening the cries and whoops from the saloon, and pieces started changing hands again, diving deep into saddle bags, matched by curses and laughter. A man ran over to wear Two-Twin lay, dead as a doornail, a giant hole burned in his coat and a swollen bruise on his lifeless chest. The man stretched out a rope, took measurements for the coffin. Miss Poppy curtsied to the body before rounding the observers to collect her winnings. I tipped my shadowmaker at the defeated fighter, extinguished faster than greased lightning. Ma always said to respect the dead, especially Showdown fighters. Honour ain’t dead if even one person remembers, she said.\n\nWhen the barmaid circled to where she stood, I held out her chit, beaming. “I picked you!”\n\nMs. Poppy returned the smile. “Smart girl.” She looked at the paper, frowned. “Just one piece?”\n\n“Sorry, it’s all I have.” I jerked her thumb behind her to the saloon. “Pa’s in there spending the rest on whiskey and vapour.”\n\nThe fighter smiled, big and bright. “Gotcha. Bobbeh,” she waved to the bookmaker,” pay this doll her money.” Bookmaker Bobbeh waddled over until he stood next to the barmaid, head coming level with her shoulders. He inspected my paper and flipped seven pieces over the gate.\n\nHell, I had forgotten the rake. No matter, seven was still better than one. Ms. Poppy turned away, but before she moved on I blurted her mind. “Where did you learn to do that?”\n\n“Do what, honey?” The barmaid looked over the side of her shoulder, eagerness on her face to keep collecting.\n\n“Control your Blaze, make it ripple.” I held out my hands, tiny sparks at the tips of my fingers. “Mine just explodes out, you know? No focus.”\n\n“Takes time,” said Ms. Poppy. “But a cowboy like you probably doesn’t get much opportunity to practice, drive to drive, marshals at your back.”\n\n“You ain’t wrong.”\n\nMs. Poppy laughed, curled her finger and beckoned me closer. I leaned in and the barmaid whispered, “Only place you’re going to learn is in the Showdown, honey, where the money’s good. Not worth the risk otherwise; not even in the Outskirts. Tell you a secret, though. It’s not how pretty you make the Blaze; it’s how fast you are, how precise. Worry about that first before you look to entertain.” Ms. Poppy left with a wink, off to gather the rest of her prize.\n\nI jumped down, boots sinking into mud which I scraped off as I made my way back to the saloon. Raised voices continued to seep into the deepening night, the game far from over, Pa still afloat, somehow. I rattled the seven pieces in my pocket, a fortune. Briefly, my mind flashed a new saddle. But no. Instead, I strolled through town looking for a market open at the late hour, which I found. Two pieces bought freshly ground coffee, a few husks of corn, and jerky. A hearty breakfast for a new day, and something to take the sting out of Pa’s hangover.\n\nSatisfied, I sat on the porch, crossed my arms on my knees and rested my head, settling in for a later night than expected.", "timestamp": 1633460325, "digest": "a7z6sBzLvf-d9rxJ8vz8rmawwZYoF6q7NX451ZwZDF0", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "xrqjPt04t0CmcSKEq4KMBRwsysB7Ny5szom7uhC3cbM", "title": "Chapter One: Counterpoint", "body": "I still didn’t know what was going on. I remembered walking through night-markets in Shinjuku, eating fried octopus and watching neon lights ripple in the air over thousands of crowded locals and tourists alike. I remembered seeing a light, intense and enormous, then hearing screams and the pounding of feet on pavement. I remembered waking up in this room.\n\nThere were others, maybe a few hundred. No one had talked me or answered my questions. Not even when I had yelled or beat my hands against grey walls until my fists bruised and bled. The others had just sat and watched, twirled the ends of their sashes in their hands or laid back on beds protruding from the floor. I became accustomed to silence.\n\nSeveral more newcomers had appeared in the room since I first woke up. I hadn’t seen them arrive. How was that possible? They must have arrived while I was sleeping, awoken to their new reality just like I had. Each arrival wore similar clothes—white, loose fitting but durable robes, like a uniform or a gi from a martial arts studio, cinched by different coloured sashes. I counted four: blue, red, green, purple. To pass the time, I tried to find patterns, segment the colours between girls and boys, by age, by hair and skin colour, by height or weight. I’d always been good at patterns, but I saw nothing.\n\nNothing made sense. I would have gone crazy if not for the chimes. One for a meal, two for a snack. Three chimes to indicate a bathroom break, followed by the materialization of a door—or a dematerialization of a part of the wall—and a hallway flickering with hazy illumination. Before yesterday I’d never seen anything appear or disappear in such a way, but I didn’t care about spectacles or illusions or physics. I focused only on keeping sane, fighting the disassociation assaulting my mind. The chimes offered routine, and I clung to them.\n\nI listened to four chimes while laying on my bed, and then the room went dark with the thunk of powerful lights being deactivated. Immediately, the stars far above the windowed ceiling revealed themselves and began to twinkle. My eyes drifted to a large orb, bright and blue, and I played with one thought before falling asleep: *Where am I?*\n\n \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n \n\nThings changed in the morning after the breakfast chime. Our food trays disappeared into the ground, fizzles from existence like the coming and going of the bathroom door, and then the room moved. It had been rectangular, cavernous, like a warehouse storing sacks of flesh and blood. Now it became square and squished, the ceiling so close I could reach up and touch the glass of the window. It was cold—very cold—and I pulled my hand away.\n\nMurmurs filtered through us, whispers and questions revealing fright and dismay. Our nature brought us together and we huddled as close as possible for several hundred bodies. Then four doorways materialized, one for each wall of the square. Behind each door stretched a hallway lit up by a different colour, one for each of our sashes: blue, red, green, purple. Five chimes rang, and the murmuring became a crescendo of confusion. No one moved to the hallways. Everyone stayed huddled in the middle of the room. Some yelled and swore, cussing at no one in particular. The five chimes rang again, and the square shrank. A girl screamed, and a young boy began crying. An older boy knelt beside the crying boy in an attempt to provide comfort, the first display of kindness I’d seen. Still, no one moved. The chimes rang again. The square shrank, the walls so close those of us on the outer edges of the huddles mass could brace against them.\n\nThe implications were simple, so we started shifting to the hallways matching our sashes. I gripped mine by the dangling end and raised it in front of me. The material was soft, but when I tugged at each end I could sense its toughness and tensile strength. I let it fall to my side and then end bounced against my knee, then I walked to the edge of my hallway. A girl stepped next to me and I looked at her, measured her. She appeared about my age and stood a foot shorter. Her oval face ended in a point at her chin and she set her jaw firm, framed by long black hair and bangs that did not entirely hide green eyes, narrowed and angry.\n\n“My name is Ikko,” I said.\n\nThe girl shifted a glance but did not respond. I contemplated her for a moment before turning away and stepping side the hallway. My gi tinted green under the lights and I walked forward into a future I did not understand, to a destination I did not know. I looked back to see the others with green sashes follow me, led by the black-haired girl.\n\nWe walked straight ahead for a long time. The hallway never turned or curved. The floor under our feet was cold and smooth, formed by the same polished metal from within the room. So were the walls, which had no doorways or seams. Claustrophobia set in, and the sounds of breathing grew more laboured and rapid. More of us cried, pleaded for parents and familiar faces, horrible despair echoing through the tight corridor and infecting my calm. I tried to resist the temptation to give in to the agony of the unknown until the very end.\n\nI was saved by the end of the hallway. When I stopped and pressed my palms against the door, I closed my eyes and squeezed out a single tear. I wiped it away with the end of my sash, then turned to the mass of bodies who had stopped behind me.\n\n“We are here,” I said.\n\n“Where is here?” The black-haired girl spoke with no emotion in her voice, cold as the ceiling that had sheltered us from the stars. I had no answer, so I gave none. Instead, I pushed against the door. It did not swing open or give way, but it dematerialized as the others had done.\n\nAnother room opened before us. It was circular and ringed by a series of bed stacked three high. In the middle of the room I saw several chairs and tables, and upon those tables various contraptions made of a shimmering metal. And furthest from the door, a man sat at a desk. He also wore a gi—green, not white like ours—wrapped by a white sash. The man’s hair was tied up in a knot atop his head. His eyebrows were thick and bushy, and a single strip of beard fell from his lip below his chin. When we opened the door and entered the room, he stood from his desk and clasped his hands behind his back.\n\n“Welcome, Greens.”\n\nThe others fell into a flurry of motion and noise, running to them man and screaming, slamming their palms down on tables and kicking chairs. They wanted answers, they said they deserved answers, and they were right. I demanded answers, too. Why had we been brought here? Where was *here*? Who had brought us, and when would we return?\n\nBut the man offered no answers. He simply watched, silent, unmoving. Eventually the screams petered out, the disorder quieted, and the Greens began laying on bed or sitting in chairs. The stink of defeat sat heavy in the still air of the circular room. Only then did the man speak.\n\n“I will return in seven days.” A door materialized behind the man’s desk. He left and the door dematerialized, replaced by smooth, polished wall, leaving us alone with each other and the tables and the strange metallic contraptions upon them.\n\n“This is bullshit!” An older boy yelled at the wall and returned to disorder. Many joined him in throwing the contraptions around the wall and overturning furniture. I watched but did not give in to my emotion. Instead I called upon a stream of calm running through me, focused on self-control. I remembered kneeling in the grass while a gentle breeze flowed through my hair and rustled cherry blossoms. The memory was fuzzy and fragmented. How long ago had it been? How long have I been here?\n\n“You seek zen.” The black-haired girl stood next to me. She, too, removed herself from the chaos of the Greens who rejected their reality and expressed themselves with rage. \n\n“Where are you from, Ikko?”\n\n“My family lives in a small city in the north—Kakunodate—and I grew up in and around there. More recently I moved to Tokyo proper to pursue further training.”\n\n“Training for what?” she asked in earnest.\n\nI hesitated to tell her the truth, because my family and friends believed my pursuit to be foolish. Most refused to support me. Some would not even talk to me any more. They had preferred for me to focus on education and career, to become a salaryman like my siblings and cousins. But I had never developed that interest, had never wanted to follow that path. I had chosen for myself and accepted the consequences.\n\n“In the ways of bushido and samurai.”\n\nTo my surprise, the girl did not scoff or shrug. She did not cast judgment or seek to lecture me on honouring my family’s wishes. Instead, the girl crossed her arms and kept her eyes on the chaos unfolding in the circular room. Then she spoke.\n\n“My name is Hatsue. I am from Osaka.”\n\nI’d never been to Osaka, nor anywhere else in the country other than my small village and the sprawling metropolis of Tokyo. “What’s it like?”\n\n“Osaka?” She bit her lip and tugged at one the curving strands of hair that framed her face. “Vibrant. The people are friendly and the city is alive. And the food is amazing.”\n\n“Do you eat away from home often?”\n\n“I must, as I am a chef. My speciality is soba noodles, which I make from scratch every day.”\n\nI was impressed. Though I lacked experience in my own country, I understood its culture deeply. Crafting soba noodles was a thorough and detailed process. It took meticulous and time-consuming attention. Hatsue was an artisan. Nothing like me. No pattern.\n\n \n\n“Why do you think we are here, Hatsue?”\n\nShe finally turned to look at me, uncrossing her arms and gripping me gently by the arms. “I have been asking myself that question for two weeks.”\n\nTwo weeks? Hatsue had been here much longer than me. “How many of you were there when you woke up?”\n\n“A few, maybe a dozen,” she said.\n\n“Did you speak with anyone?”\n\n“No. No one seemed eager for conversation. We were all to confused and frightened, and that disarray only continued as more and more people began to appear.” She paused and cocked her head. “I remember when you arrived. You were among the last.”\n\nI squeezed my eyes. “I remember a bright light, and screaming.” I opened my eyes. “We ran.”\n\nHatsue nodded, recognition in her face. “I also saw a light. We also screamed and ran.”\n\n“What was it?”\n\n“I don’t know. Does it matter?” She shook her head. “We are here, and that man is returning in seven days. We are called Greens and there are a number of puzzles scattered about the room. Maybe we should keep our focus there until the man returns.”\n\nI squinted, inspecting Hatsue’s eyes and the corners of her mouth. “You are exceptionally calm. Perhaps you would be interested to the ways of bushido.”\n\nAt last, Hatsue smiled. “Perhaps I have been. Come,” she grabbed my hand,” let’s go talk to the others and try to figure out what it is our hosts expect from us.”", "timestamp": 1633463020, "digest": "WqfStekH7Ujt6IiWdHIvf64aC__Ih2OgODEWuSavWPw", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "yhAL2RWMu9cD0q7WM92w3Kxpen_Xc7HzrWBpzpWE0GM", "title": "Chapter One: Valour and Virtue", "body": "Fires burned from torches held high by the soldiers who’d survived the night. They stood at attention, sadness in their eyes, faces blackened and bloodied, bodies broken and scarred. But they lived. Those who lay atop the pyres did not.\n\nMorning came with a chill, the kind blown in over water, but the forces of Duneld did not waiver; they guarded their fallen, and would until the flames took them, as was the way.\n\n“Shouldn’t you be down there with your brother?”\n\nMairi pulled up her cloak to turn away the brittle wind and faced her mother, whose voice had been filled with judgment. Her mother did not keep secret her disdain for her daughter’s path.\n\n“It is not my place, Mother.”\n\n“You fought among them, did you not?”\n\nViolence took Mairi’s vision. Black blood had spilled across her edge as she had sliced it through the dark things that had come for them. It had washed over her, a torrent of death for which she’d prepared, but never enough. She tasted it still, like a festering poison. \n\n“Willyem is their Grey.”\n\n“Aye,” said Flora Duneld, matriarch of the clan. “He is there Grey, but you are his sister, and you have chosen the path of valour” She stepped out from the shadows and joined her daughter at the crest of the battlements overlooking the tattered Skyreach Fields—once rolling mounds of luscious green, now a charred and stained memory.\n\nMairi bristled but kept composure, letting out a slow breath. She watched it curl upward in the frosted air, and then fade away amidst the fog. “Still, Mother?”\n\nFiora gripped the chiselled-stone railing, and her knuckles whitened beyond her already-pale complexion. Fury burned behind brown eyes, concealed only slightly by her picture of beauty, marked by a perfectly oval face around which fell long, raven-black hair.\n\n“Still, my daughter. Your path was to be virtue.”\n\n“But I am not virtuous,” said Mairi.\n\n“That never mattered.” Her mother spoke as cold as the morning. “Valour and virtue is the way. It has always been the way. What will the clan do now, daughter?”\n\nMairi watched the solemn vigil taking place at the base of their hold. She admired the strength in the silence of the valiant few who remained to fly their colours. Willyem had emerged from the gates, and all eyes followed his slow march between the rows of pyres. He would visit them all—hundreds of them—to say a quiet word known only to him and the dead.\n\nShe reached up and played with the iron clasp holding tight her ceremonial cloak, patterned white and black, inscribed with the old words: “Valour and virtue.”\n\n“Mother,” said Mairi, “you shepherd this family; you lead this clan. No one could do justice to our interests better.”\n\n“I won’t be here forever, Mairi. What then?”\n\nBelow, Willyem continued delivering the last rights to the fallen, his white and black cloak billowing around him as he walked. Her brother had always been statuesque, like a hero from history born anew. But not even he could face the wars to come without help.\n\n“First there must be a forever,” said Mairi. “Father knew what was coming, and he trained me to fight, not to—“\n\n“Your father is dead!” Fiora seethed, still beautiful. “The path of valour is romantic, I know. The annals are full with legends of those who risked everything for glory, or honour, or whatever captured their fancy at the time. Many found success; many did not. But they are all dead, my love. It is we, the virtuous, who live on and carry forth family name.”\n\n“He needs my help,” said Mairi. “And when we unite the clans and save the island from dark hours, we will do so in the name of Duneld, and history will know.”\n\nFIora released her grip on the railing and stepped back into the shadows. “I hope you are right, Mairi. I hope you and Willyem accomplish all that you set out to do. But if you fail, my daughter, what will history have to say about us then? Perhaps nothing at all.”\n\nAfter her mother had left, Mairi remained alone in quiet observation of the vigil. Though tormented by her decision to pursue valour, and her mother’s words, she found herself resolute. Teeth gritted, she braced against the cold but did not move, and she stilled herself as best she could. Though she had no torch, she would guard the dead until the flames took them, as was the way.\n\nThe morning passed slow, and her brother’s march took time, but she did not move. She did not take her eyes away from her Grey, the boy with whom she’d grown right here in the Hold—the man who carried her father’s edge and who inspired love in all those who followed him. She would follow, too, for she was a valiant of Clan Duneld. That was her path.\n\nWillyem walked back to the base of the Hold where the soldiers stood, their torches still raised high, still flickering in the frost. He drew his edge, then he planted in in the rocky mud.\n\nHe spoke aloud, to no one in particular, and his voice carried far. “The night has ended. Then sun has risen. Breath fills our lunges. Blood runs in our veins.” He paused, then looked up and behind him, to where Mairi stood, still as stone. Their blue eyes met, but they shared no smile.\n\nHe pulled away his gaze and continued his sermon. “We live, aye, but our brothers and sisters fell, never to wake. They fought hard. They fought true. They lived and die for the clan. Our clan. Remember them, so their names might live forever.” Willyem readied his torch. “May they pass in peace. May our ancestors receive them. Valour, and virtue.”\n\nThe silent monoliths who stood at attention behind their Grey in unison thumped a fist against their chest and called out in one great voice: “Valour, and virtue!”\n\nThe sound echoed in the morning, and then all was serene once again. Willyem lowered his torch to the ground and lit the first pyre. His signal accepted, others moved forward and lit pyres, until they all began to burn, a great fire stretching into the horizon. The flames filled Mairi’s brown eyes, and she whispered to herself: “Valour, and virtue.”\n\n \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n \n\n“I thought I’d find you here.”\n\nMairi approached her brother, who at the edge of Wave’s End, the lake stretching from the northern sea to the edge of Cloudhold, clan Duneld’s family home. Wind was ever-present in their part of the Great Isle, and now it was gently pushing the water to the shore so that it lapped over the rocky beach. She loved the sound. This type of day had always been her favourite, back when she was innocent, and had not seen the things she had, nor done the things she had.\n\n“Father was right.” Without looking at his sister, Willyem spoke in the same distracted manner as at the vigil, as if he saw something over the water she could not. Perhaps he did. Perhaps that’s why the valiant chose him as their Grey, discarding the older, wiser, more hardened men who’d sought the head of the Duneld forces.\n\n“About what, Willyem?” She stood at his side now, her head stopping at his broad shoulders. She looked out over the water to look for what he saw, but found nothing but more water.\n\n“The eternal war,” he said. “That we are the shield.”\n\nMairi sighed, and her brother noticed.\n\n“Even after last night, and you don’t believe,” he said. It had not been a question.\n\n“I know what I saw, Brother.”\n\n“What did you see?” he asked. “I’ve been trying to describe it to myself, but I cannot find the words.”\n\nMairi again tasted black blood that had filled her mouth as she had bathed in chaos of dying men and women and… things. In the dawn, after she had crawled out from the muck, life clinging to her ragged self, she had drenched herself with steamed and perfumed water, and she had scrubbed herself raw, until her skin was red and her soul bare. Still, the vile remained with her. She couldn’t imagine ever being clean again.\n\n“I saw *them*,” she said. “Just as father foretold. Just as the tomes beneath the Hold caution. Just as the carvings at Old Rock depict.”\n\n“Aye,” said Willyem. “It was them. They died all the same.” One of his hands rested atop the handle of his edge hanging from his waist. He placed the other around his sister’s shoulder. “I saw you, Mairi, fighting. You have fire in you. Father would have been proud.”\n\n“Mother isn’t.”\n\nWillyem laughed, in his way. The hint of a smile played at his lips, and his eyes twinkled, but he stayed quiet, and his face did not move. “She only wants the best for our clan. A *future*, for our clan.”\n\n“I am no lady of virtue, Brother.”\n\n“No,” he said. “But you’re a daughter of Duneld all the same. There have always been two paths, Mairi. The clan needs both to survive.”\n\n“Virtue would not have survived the night.”\n\nWillyem bowed his head, then crouched. He reached for the lapping lake-water, and allowed it to flow over his ungloved finger. “I suspect not,” he said. “But virtue will lead us through many more.”\n\n“The other clans,” said Mairi.\n\n“Aye,” said Willyem. “The other clans.”\n\n“But you said it yourself, *we* are the shield. No other clan built their castles at the edges of the water; they’re all inland, Brother.”\n\n“Now we know why.”\n\nMairi stood quiet with her brother for some time, both looking out toward the mouth of the northern sea, from where dark things had come in the night. She walked closer to the shore.\n\n“Do you remember when we were children, Willyem? When we would dance in the water for hours and hours, splashing each other, racing from edge to edge, laughing until mother called us for dinner.”\n\nHe nodded. “Aye. I remember.”\n\n“Come,” she took off her boots and waded into the lake, reaching back to him. “Let us dance one last time, before the end of the world.”\n\nWillyem stared at her, his round eyes brilliant blue, like hers—like their father’s. She saw pain within them, and the same lingering sadness he always carried.\n\n“Mairi,” he said. “Dancing and splashing and racing and laughing…these are the actions of the innocent, and the joyous, and the free.”\n\n“Are we not those things, Brother?” She found herself pleading.\n\n“None of us are. Not any more.”\n\nThe cold of the lake hit her just then. It sunk beneath her skin and travelled through her body, until her spine chilled and heart numbed.\n\n“We deserve to be,” she said.\n\nWillyem pulled his eyes from hers and looked past her, toward the emptiness of the horizon, toward the same unknown she could not see.\n\n“When the time comes,” he said, “let us hope there is more mother in you than father. Not all of the clans will unite under valour; it will take virtue, too.”\n\n“Aye, Willyem,” she said. “Let us hope.”\n\nHe turned from her, standing alone in the lake, and began to walk back to the Hold. “Tomorrow, we ride for Clan Quarry. Let us begin there.”\n\n \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n \n\nWhen they left the next day, the ground shook beneath the feet of a thousand pairs of marching feet. None of the valiant men and women of Duneld who remained after the long night of terror had protested their new duty. None complained of weariness. None begged reprieve. Honour commanded their hearts as much as love of clan and country.\n\nCountry. The Great Isle. Home to many names and many stories—most marked by blood. How many years had it been, Mairi wondered, since war had broken out among the clans? It was all she knew. It was all she’d learned. Had it always been this way, or had there been a peace, long ago?\n\nShe walked beside her brother and the tip of the spear that was the valiant of Duneld, edges hanging from the belts, cloaks around their shoulders, banners at their backs. For a little while, they walked without interruption or distraction. Only the sounds of the Great Isle played in their ears, a counterpoint to the thundering march. Then it began to rain.\n\nDroplets pattered off steel and soaked leather, and the black hair of Willyem and Mairi Duneld dampened until it clung to their faces. She smelled sulphur lingering from a thunderstorm long past—or was it on its way?—and the emerald grass beneath their feet became soft and matted.\n\n“Clan Quarry is small, Brother, and Oathkeep is tucked away far to the east.”\n\n“Aye,” he said. “So they are; so it is.”\n\n“Why begin there? Their influence is light; they matter not in the grand scheme.”\n\nWillyem pulled himself up over topple rock from an age long past, then reached to his sister to help her. “Is that what mother says?”\n\n“She may have mentioned it a time or two when discussing clan politics.”\n\nHe looked at her. “Since when do you pay attention to politics?”\n\n“I haven’t always walked this path, Brother.”\n\nThunder sounded in the distance, from the direction in which they travelled. The storm would be upon them soon.\n\n“I suppose not,” he said. “Tell me, Mairi, do you know the Quarry home is called Oathkeep?”\n\n“I don’t,” she answered.\n\n“Legends say Clan Quarry was once mighty, spanning the entire coast, led by a man of great revere.”\n\n“Legends?” she asked.\n\nWillyem looked at her. “Father.” He continued. “There was to be a great battle, perhaps the greatest the Isle has ever seen, and the ancestors of Duneld needed aid. You’ve heard of Mulcom?”\n\n“Of course,” she said. “We bear his words on our crest.”\n\n“Aye,” said Willyem. “Mulcom approached the Quarry for an oath—an oath to come to their call when the battle came to Duneld.”\n\n“Why would the Quarry agree?”\n\n“Don’t know,” said Willyem. “But they did. And they kept their oath. In return, Mulcom gifted them the castle now called Oathkeep.”\n\nMairi didn’t know what to say. All of this information was new to her—something never told when she had learned the history of the Great Isle and of its clans. And perhaps she was more shocked to hear her brother speak of things other than steel and iron and blood.\n\n“If the legend is true—if *father* was right—the years have not been kind to Clan Quarry.”\n\n“No,” said Willyem.\n\n“You think they’ll stand by an oath pulled from history?”\n\n“Maybe not,” he said. “But there is open war between the clans. Nowhere is safe on the Great Isle—less so now. Only the Quarry stay tucked away, as you said; only the Quarry have no sides to choose.”\n\n“What of their own side?”\n\nWillyem thought for a moment before giving his reply. “If they choose their side, that is their choice. But we have to try.”\n\nAnother crack of thunder resonated, louder than before, and the rain began to fall harder. Mairi pulled up her hood to shelter herself. Her brother did the same.\n\n“Do you think they’ll believe us?”\n\n“About the dark?” he asked.\n\n“About them, about everything. To see is to know. We know.”\n\nHe looked over his shoulder at the marching valiant, then met her stare. “I wouldn’t. They won’t.”\n\n“No, I don’t suppose they will.”\n\n ", "timestamp": 1633461002, "digest": "wIFNyAkxt0DevWRQDBZ_P6Qk3R5JDbh7waALTK2E7Io", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}

{"id": "9504Qyjl-yvDeRLNlZQ93JBxx_1_xgqetktAWrDcCig", "title": "Ink - a social protocol", "body": "## Introduction\n\nSocial platforms have emerged as a way for people to communicate online ever since the dawn of the internet. Evolving gradually, from the colourful and busy profiles of MySpace  and personal websites to the carefully manicured and factory-style Facebook profiles, communication on the internet has seen rapid expansion. Now, ever since Satoshi Nakamoto published his inaugural whitepaper ‘[Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper)’ and a consortium of privacy concerns, a new standard for social has emerged: decentralization. This follows the natural progression from Web1 to Web2 and now what has been coined (no pun intended) as Web3. The somewhat expected and also necessary cultural revolution that ensued has led to a multitude of technological innovations, including smart contracts and defi to name a couple. This article proposes a new means of social communication on the internet and Ethereum blockchain: Ink.\n\n## Principles\n\nWhilst building Ink we have tried to maintain and stick to a set of core values and principles, as to not deviate from the original goal of the protocol.\n\n* **Accessibility / Freedom of participation** The protocol should be accessible to anyone, regardless of IRL persona or capital. This may include the platform being made chain-agnostic, or including gasless transactions in future, as well as enabling nothing but an Ethereum wallet and $INK to access. (1 $INK will be airdropped free to users)\n* **Freedom of expression** The protocol should be free for anyone to express their thoughts, opinions and ideas, provided it doesn’t clash with the first principle. The official Ink frontend may include *some* built in censorship features to protect the average user, but the contract itself will be free to use and we would love to see users create their own secondary UI / frontends.\n* **Decentralization** The platform will be controlled not by one person but by its users. It will *not* be hosted on a server and will *not* be mediated or moderated by us (the core developers). Alongside this, all the code will be opensource.\n\n## Protocol\n\nAt Ink, we are trying to design a  social protocol that aims to enhance the existing platforms of today and free users from the shackles of centralization. This requires both necessary and interesting new features, as well as an innovative new business model. We propose the protocol includes these features, some being added after the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is released.\n\n* **Posting.** Users can post to Ink freely. Put at a high level, posting is simply pushing to the `postIndex`mapping. Posting on Ink is different to posting on a traditional social platform in two key ways. Firstly, posts have the ability to receive $INK. This is displayed on your post and is key to the protocol remaining free from bad actors and bots. Secondly, the poster has the ability to mint their posts as an NFT, meaning it can be owned and published immutably on the blockchain, solving power abuse issues traditional platforms’ users have had to succumb to.\n* **Follow / unfollow** This is somewhat secondary to the $INK token, due to the somewhat artificial click of a button, versus the thoughtful gift of something that holds monetary value as well as utility. Despite this, the platform will still have a way of following creators as a method of feed curation and keeping tabs on friends and community members\n* **Tip posts / users** The protocol will allow users to tip other users and posts in our utility token, $INK. This again prevents bad actors and bots from abusing the platform (read up on [reputation](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/aXm3OTVTK26hN2QKu82s8NjLQYPKCOMiVD2zIioCOVU) in web3 here), as well as a way to incentivize and pay independent creators.\n* **Social tokens / Group chat** *(post MVP)* One aspect that could revolutionize the creator economy and internet is tokenized communities. This provides a means of truly decentralized creation and support, as well as a fun way to interact with your community. We propose a token-gated chat and DM feature for Ink, as well as token gated posts. This feature will hopefully be released after our initial v1 product or MVP.\n\nHopefully, Ink will migrate to a DAO structure, enabling true decentralization and participation. Whilst we are still raising funds and developing the product, we are remaining as a decentralized community / project not a DAO, as to speed up development and ensure the product is as good as possible.", "timestamp": 1633464464, "digest": "aQrz62hqUpq1GiXoFb0b_cYudW8SiomdHB2dbyIJr5U", "contributor": "0xdAB0A5d15ff6B75E69256c29609d2Fc3eBbFEb04"}

Not sure that could have been remotely possible, but while the flood of early ICOs engendered a lot of flack, the protocols and companies leading today’s groundbreaking revolutions (DeFi, NFTs, Web3, etc.) were largely built on the back of ICOs. And since that time, the ICO itself has evolved to include Token Generating Events, SAFTs, Security Token Offerings, Liquidity Generating Events, Initial Exchange Offerings, and Initial Dex Offerings (at least). Each offers a unique set of pros and cons that allow non-US entrepreneurs the freedom to select a fundraising path tailored to their project.\n\nWe’re here to suggest yet another route.\n\n**SAFE, SAFT, and the Pre-Mine IDO**\n\nStartups often take advantage of something called a SAFE- the Simple Agreement for Future Equity. The theory here is that brand new startups are difficult to price. Rather than raising $X at a specific enterprise value before getting data on tiny things like product-market-fit or total addressable market, the SAFE allows startups to raise money in return for an agreement to issue equity to investors in the subsequent priced round. Typically, this includes a discount to account for the risk of investing early and/or a cap to put an upper bound on extreme investor dilution. But, the specific mechanics are flexible and the agreement is intentionally simple (adding the additional benefit of lower legal costs).\n\nThe beauty of the SAFE is startups and investors can affordably raise and minimize the risks associated with pricing an early-round inefficiently where one side gets too much equity or the relationship gets otherwise mired with investor provisions.\n\nThe SAFT emerged to bring the power of the SAFE to blockchain projects. It was quickly shut down by regulators who pointed out it was just a security offering by another name. The SAFT avoided the requirement to lock in tokenomics because you weren’t issuing a token. Premature tokenization doesn’t just mess with the cap table, it messes with the mechanics of the entire project. If the project happens to be similar to an existing project, this might not be a concern, but if you are building something new, locking in the game-theoretical mechanics is reckless. For example, what if it turns out an inflationary issuance model would have worked better? What if there’s an opportunity for the community to engage but they are turned off by massive founder grants? Alternatively, what if big grants are needed to attract the initial team?\n\nThere is a disturbing trend in the blockchain world where VCs capture the big gains from projects before public token allocations. A new and amazing project might have been discovered by a smart community member, but that project will have achieved a massive market cap in the private markets before said community member can invest. Frankly, it’s un-American. I earned my dollar, how can you tell me I can’t invest it. SAFTs fail in this regard because they require accredited investors. SAFTs are also paper documents with only the promise for future tokens. So, if you need an actual token for utility or governance, a SAFT will not do. New Jobs Act options like Reg CF and Reg A similarly don’t work due to the tradeable nature of tokens.\n\nHere is where the pre-mine IDO shines. Like an IDO, placeholder tokens become immediately available on decentralized exchanges. This democratizes access to the upside. But, like a SAFT, locked tokenomics are replaced with clear communication that the pre-mine IDO token will be replaced at a future date.\n\nSo, could you even issue a token without setting the tokenomics? It is Ethereum we are talking about here, so… yes. Could you equitably build a liquid community from the start? The answer there has to be yes. Would projects benefit from being able to adjust mechanics according to product-market fit? The project has to benefit, but this lack of certainty does bring additional investor risk.\n\nWe’ll need some guardrails.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nIssue a litepaper that outlines the opportunity and the “planned” tokenomics. This manages expectations but allows for modification as a project develops a community and experiences the market.\n\nIssue a statement about funding goals of the Premine IDO adding details like investor provisions and the number of tokens to be airdropped to the team and community.\n\nInvestor provisions could include the promise to issue a detailed statement including locked tokenomics and roadmap seven days prior to the next token allocation. Promise to grant token holders who bought during the pre-mine IDO an air-drop of new tokens to ensure they have a 1.25X ROI on any tokens that have never been swapped.\n\nIf you are actively trading in and out of the token, you void any rights to investor protections. If the token has a greater than 25% price appreciation there will be no need for the 25% investor protection. You got in early, and you made money because you were early. By issuing a statement that includes the official tokenomics and roadmap seven days prior to the token allocation that follows the pre-mine IDO, investors have time to sell their tokens in the case that they don’t like the direction, or tokenomics, or are concerned about a rug-pull. Of course, once the IDO starts they might not get back in if they do sell.\n\nSell tokens directly to early investors. Airdrop tokens to community and team. Shout from the hilltops.

The more ambitious you are, the bigger the problems you seek out to solve.\n\nA problem, in this context, is defined as an unfulfilled desire — **there is something out there that you want and currently do not have.** Solving problems means fulfilling that desire and getting what you want.\n\nMost ambitious people never accomplish their dreams because they don’t understand the rules of the game or how it works. Worse, more never come to realize **they’re playing the wrong game to begin with.**\n\nThe main set of problems people set out to solve (i.e. the games they choose to play) are:\n\n1. **Goal attainment** (fulfilling desires/solving problems, accomplishing goals): this is the “game”\n2. **Fulfillment** (feeling good about ourselves as a result of actuating potential): this is the *real* game\n3. **Connection** (serving others, contributing to the group, feeling connected beyond ourselves): this is an extension of the game\n\nLet’s break each of these down further.\n\n### The “game”\n\nHere’s how the goal attainment “game” works:\n\n1. you start with `time` and `energy` as raw materials\n2. `time` and `energy` is expended through `behaviors` (actions you take; things you do or don’t do), which provide `information` through feedback\n3. resilient `information` (`knowledge`) is used to solve `problems`, which is `valuable`\n4. `value` generated from the `labor` of solving `problems` is primarily captured and exchanged through `social capital` and `financial capital`\n5. `capital` is reinvested into other forms of `leverage` to maximize `time` and `energy` so you can do more (solve more/bigger problems) with less\n6. you repeat the process above until you run out of `time` or realize there’s more to the game\n\nThe above process serves as the foundation for everything that revolves around our productive lives: health, psychology, education, media, work, business, economics, technology and more.

Not sure that could have been remotely possible, but while the flood of early ICOs engendered a lot of flack, the protocols and companies leading today’s groundbreaking revolutions (DeFi, NFTs, Web3, etc.) were largely built on the back of ICOs. And since that time, the ICO itself has evolved to include Token Generating Events, SAFTs, Security Token Offerings, Liquidity Generating Events, Initial Exchange Offerings, and Initial Dex Offerings (at least). Each offers a unique set of pros and cons that allow non-US entrepreneurs the freedom to select a fundraising path tailored to their project.\n\nWe’re here to suggest yet another route.\n\n**SAFE, SAFT, and the Pre-Mine IDO**\n\nStartups often take advantage of something called a SAFE- the Simple Agreement for Future Equity. The theory here is that brand new startups are difficult to price. Rather than raising $X at a specific enterprise value before getting data on tiny things like product-market-fit or total addressable market, the SAFE allows startups to raise money in return for an agreement to issue equity to investors in the subsequent priced round. Typically, this includes a discount to account for the risk of investing early and/or a cap to put an upper bound on extreme investor dilution. But, the specific mechanics are flexible and the agreement is intentionally simple (adding the additional benefit of lower legal costs).\n\nThe beauty of the SAFE is startups and investors can affordably raise and minimize the risks associated with pricing an early-round inefficiently where one side gets too much equity or the relationship gets otherwise mired with investor provisions.\n\nThe SAFT emerged to bring the power of the SAFE to blockchain projects. It was quickly shut down by regulators who pointed out it was just a security offering by another name. The SAFT avoided the requirement to lock in tokenomics because you weren’t issuing a token. Premature tokenization doesn’t just mess with the cap table, it messes with the mechanics of the entire project. If the project happens to be similar to an existing project, this might not be a concern, but if you are building something new, locking in the game-theoretical mechanics is reckless. For example, what if it turns out an inflationary issuance model would have worked better? What if there’s an opportunity for the community to engage but they are turned off by massive founder grants? Alternatively, what if big grants are needed to attract the initial team?\n\nThere is a disturbing trend in the blockchain world where VCs capture the big gains from projects before public token allocations. A new and amazing project might have been discovered by a smart community member, but that project will have achieved a massive market cap in the private markets before said community member can invest. Frankly, it’s un-American. I earned my dollar, how can you tell me I can’t invest it. SAFTs fail in this regard because they require accredited investors. SAFTs are also paper documents with only the promise for future tokens. So, if you need an actual token for utility or governance, a SAFT will not do. New Jobs Act options like Reg CF and Reg A similarly don’t work due to the tradeable nature of tokens.\n\nHere is where the pre-mine IDO shines. Like an IDO, placeholder tokens become immediately available on decentralized exchanges. This democratizes access to the upside. But, like a SAFT, locked tokenomics are replaced with clear communication that the pre-mine IDO token will be replaced at a future date.\n\nSo, could you even issue a token without setting the tokenomics? It is Ethereum we are talking about here, so… yes. Could you equitably build a liquid community from the start? The answer there has to be yes. Would projects benefit from being able to adjust mechanics according to product-market fit? The project has to benefit, but this lack of certainty does bring additional investor risk.\n\nWe’ll need some guardrails.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nIssue a litepaper that outlines the opportunity and the “planned” tokenomics. This manages expectations but allows for modification as a project develops a community and experiences the market.\n\nIssue a statement about funding goals of the Premine IDO adding details like investor provisions and the number of tokens to be airdropped to the team and community.\n\nInvestor provisions could include the promise to issue a detailed statement including locked tokenomics and roadmap seven days prior to the next token allocation. Promise to grant token holders who bought during the pre-mine IDO an air-drop of new tokens to ensure they have a 1.25X ROI on any tokens that have never been swapped.\n\nIf you are actively trading in and out of the token, you void any rights to investor protections. If the token has a greater than 25% price appreciation there will be no need for the 25% investor protection. You got in early, and you made money because you were early. By issuing a statement that includes the official tokenomics and roadmap seven days prior to the token allocation that follows the pre-mine IDO, investors have time to sell their tokens in the case that they don’t like the direction, or tokenomics, or are concerned about a rug-pull. Of course, once the IDO starts they might not get back in if they do sell.\n\nSell tokens directly to early investors. Airdrop tokens to community and team. Shout from the hilltops. And, let the decentralized exchanges do their thing.\n\nRelax and build.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, projects differ, motivations differ, and access to capital differs. Maybe the guardrails need refinement. Maybe most projects are better suited to existing token allocation schemes. We think there’s value in allowing teams the wisdom of time to refine their tokenomics. We think there’s value in prioritizing equal access to equity, right from the start.\n\nAlas, US regulations aren’t there yet. For now, we will opt for a standard seed round backed by a traditional SAFE. $WRK is a utility token. They will inevitably hit decentralized exchanges once used in our platform no matter what we try to do to stop them. Our investors will not benefit from that liquidity.\n\nMaybe someday someone will challenge these laws on the grounds that they stifle innovation, perpetuate the wealth gap, and unconstitutionally restrict people’s rights to the free and reasonable use of their capital.\n\nMaybe someday we’ll see pre-mine IDO", "timestamp": 1633464691, "digest": "n7i74FvlicZqKadPZ2SIguRlR_eOAN2sUoM__bE7_wA", "contributor": "0x6C71BAcDaAB54B4Bcb87019A292Fd1f27d0F7C08"}

In the process, I've found and thrown away a) a packet of sugar, b) two sachets of handwarming gel, and c) a crowbar.\n```\n\n```\nI'm not sure what's worse; that I didn't think about it before or that I did now.\n\n\"So you know how to use a crowbar?\n\n> You take CROWBAR.\nYou grab the crowbar with both hands and swing it at your desk. The crowbar hits the floor with a clatter, but luckily doesn't break.\n\n> You walk EAST.\nA poster on the wall informs you that there's a \"staff meeting\" at 11am. If you're going to find out what's going on, that's where you need to be.\n\n> You use CROWBAR on EDITOR.\nYou return to the main office with the crowbar. The editor is staring at it.\n\n\"Uh... It's a crowbar,\" you say awkwardly.\n\n\"You put in so much effort, didn't you?\" the editor frowns.\n\n\"It seemed... necessary.\"\n\n\"Necessary,\" the editor sighs. \"Give it to me.\"\n\nYour eyebrows rise in surprise.\n\n\"Are you... sure?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" the editor says. \"It's a crowbar. It's meant to be used. It's not doing anyone any good just lying around. Now hand it over.\"\n\nYou hand the crowbar to the editor.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" you say.\n\n\"Use your brain,\" the editor says. \"You wanted a story. Well, you've got one.\"\n\nYou stare at the editor in confusion.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"The crowbar, dummy! What else?\"\n\n\"I don't understand. What's the story? There's nothing to the crowbar.\"\n\n\"Of course there is.\"\n\n\"No, there isn't,\" you say. \"It's just a... just a simple metal bar that helps with opening things.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" the editor smiles. \"It's a metaphor. For all of us.\"\n\n\"I... I give up.\"\n\n\"All of us in this office are different people. We have different thoughts, different feelings, different desires... but we're all part of the same machine. We do the same tasks every day.\"\n\nYour eyes narrow.\n\n\"What's your point? I don't see how this is a story.\"\n\n\"It's a metaphor. The bar is you. You're a simple person. You have no depth, no complexity. You're just... a bar. You're just meant to be used.\"\n\n\"I think you've lost it,\" you say. \"I'm not a bar, I'm a person.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" the editor says. \"You're a person. The point is, you're no more special than any of us. We're all cogs in a machine. You, me, everyone. We all have our uses, but we're not important in and of ourselves.\"\n\nYou stare at the editor, aghast.\n\n\"If that's how you feel, then I pity you,\" you say. \"You can't just... reduce people to objects. We're all individuals.\"\n\nThe editor stares at you in confusion.\n\n\"What do you mean? I'm not reducing people to objects if I say they're all the same. That's literally what an object is. It's an individual piece of a greater whole. A screw has no meaning on its own, but it's important because it helps build a desk. A person is the same. I'm not saying people don't have dreams, hopes, loved ones... of course they do. But we're all just cogs in a greater machine. If one cog stops working, then the whole thing grinds to a halt. So you see? You're a cog. Me? I'm another type of cog. It's a shame you can't see the bigger picture. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to remove you from the machinery.\"\n\nThe editor steps forward, offering you the crowbar.\n\n\"Here,\" he says. \"Break my skull. I don't mind. It's what I'm here for.\"\n\nYou stare at him in confusion.\n\n\"I... What?\"\n\n\"Break my skull,\" the editor repeats. \"If you're a cog, then it's your duty to destroy another cog. It's what you're here for.\"\n\n\"That's ridiculous. Cogs don't kill each other. They just... slide past each other.\"\n\n\"No! Sometimes, cogs get stuck. When that happens, you need to unstick them. Sometimes, you need to break them. Break me. I don't mind. I've lived a good life, and I've had a great career. Now, smash my skull open. That's what I'm here for. That's what I'm for.\"\n\nYou stare at him, completely aghast.\n\n\"I... You... What? No! I'm not doing that! That's... Why would you want me to do that?\"\n\n\"Because it'll give meaning to your life,\" the editor says. \"If you kill me, it'll mean you've reached the top. You'll be the best there is. That's all any of us ever want, deep down. To be the best. To be the best mouser, the best hunter, the best writer... This is your chance. Break my skull. Prove you're the best there is. Prove you deserve your freedom.\"\n\nYou stare at him, unsure how to respond. Finally, you speak.\n\n\"I'm... I don't want to kill you,\" you say.\n\n\"Are you sure? Think it over. Seriously. Because if you don't kill me, I'm going to have to kill you.\"\n\n\"Why?\" you ask.\n\n\"Because you've proven yourself to be unreliable. If you won't kill me, I know you won't continue writing for the company. And if you won't do that, you're a threat to the company. So, I have to kill you.\"\n\n\"So...\" you say, swallowing. \"If I kill you, you'll let me go?\"\n\n\"Yes. You'll be free. The bird will be free. All will be free. So, will you do it? Kill me?\"\n\n\"I... Yes. I will,\" you say.\n\nThe editor smiles.\n\n\"Good. Then kill me. Do it now. Do it here. I'd rather not make a mess in the office. I still have so much work to do, you see. But you've got plenty of time to clean up, don't you? You're the boss now.\"\n\nYou raise the crowbar, staring at the old man. He stares back, smiling.\n\n\"Just remember,\" he says. \"I did this for you.\"\n\nAnd, with that, you bring the crowbar down against his head, and feel it crack under your strength. The old man's face collapses, and he slumps forward.\n\nHis body rapidly begins turning to stone. First, his face goes, then his hands, his feet, his arms, his legs. His entire body is transformed into a gray statue, and then that too crumbles to dust. You're left in a room with a pile of dust in the middle of it, and all that remains of the old man who changed your life.\nYou set down the crowbar, and walk towards the door. You open it, revealing the long, empty hallway. You could try to make your escape. You could head to the exit and leave this place forever. Nobody would try to stop you.\n\nBut there's more dust left. There's more ink and more paper. \nMore stories to be told, more pictures to be painted, more sounds to be heard. This place didn't save you. It didn't change you. But it gave you something to do. It taught you that life is worth living, and that play is just as important as anything else.\n\nThere's more dust left. More...\n\nTHE END\n```", "timestamp": 1633464932, "digest": "x86LIxc5CynOyrSZCQw3l18wKUt24NKkzbHbdsjKf14", "contributor": "0x4b3F8321C62982f2dfDB51AAC001e7E74c14A865"}

The more ambitious you are, the bigger the problems you seek out to solve.\n\nA problem, in this context, is defined as an unfulfilled desire — **there is something out there that you want and currently do not have.** Solving problems means fulfilling that desire and getting what you want.\n\nMost ambitious people never accomplish their dreams because they don’t understand the rules of the game or how it works. Worse, more never come to realize **they’re playing the wrong game to begin with.**\n\nThe main set of problems people set out to solve (i.e. the games they choose to play) are:\n\n1. **Goal attainment** (fulfilling desires/solving problems, accomplishing goals): this is the “game”\n2. **Fulfillment** (feeling good about ourselves as a result of actuating potential): this is the *real* game\n3. **Connection** (serving others, contributing to the group, feeling connected beyond ourselves): this is an extension of the game\n\nLet’s break each of these down further.\n\n### The “game”\n\nHere’s how the goal attainment “game” works:\n\n1. you start with `time` and `energy` as raw materials\n2. `time` and `energy` is expended through `behaviors` (actions you take; things you do or don’t do), which provide `information` through feedback\n3. resilient `information` (`knowledge`) is used to solve `problems`, which is `valuable`\n4. `value` generated from the `labor` of solving `problems` is primarily captured and exchanged through `social capital` and `financial capital`\n5. `capital` is reinvested into other forms of `leverage` to maximize `time` and `energy` so you can do more (solve more/bigger problems) with less\n6. you repeat the process above until you run out of `time` or realize there’s more to the game\n\nThe above process serves as the foundation for everything that revolves around our productive lives: health, psychology, education, media, work, business, economics, technology and more. Understanding this process and how to navigate/play it well is crucial and affords you the opportunity to spend your time how you’d like (important).\n\nHowever, this is **not** the full picture. Playing the “game” for the sake of attainment alone is a non-starter.\n\nThis is because humans are wired to endlessly desire (i.e. have problems) and seek to fulfill those desires (i.e. solve them). The irony is you could attain/accomplish everything you’ve ever wanted, and there would **still** be another thing to chase. This is what makes this particular game “infinite”.\n\nSometimes, people also play this particular “game” for the wrong reasons:\n\n[https://twitter.com/naval/status/1267179384886095873](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1267179384886095873)\n\nThe game, in its entirety, is extraordinarily difficult to navigate, let alone succeed in. Fortunately, the only thing preventing you from winning is a set of skills that **can** be learned. In future posts, I’ll cover what this looks like for the *real* game, and how innovations like crypto allow us to change the rules (and what you can do about it).\n\n[Subscribe]() to follow along as I break these down. Let's win together.

ไม่ว่าจะเป็น stablecoin (USDC, USDT, GUST, ฯลฯ) เพราะเราจะได้ดอกเบี้ยจาก crypto ที่เราฝากได้ถึง 10% ต่อปี (รึมากกว่านั้น) โดยผู้ที่ฝาก crypto กับ Celsius จะไม่มีช่วง lock-up ที่เหรียญของเราโดนล็อคไว้ในระบบ สามารถถอนออกได้ทันทีโดยไม่มีค่าธรรมเนียมการถอนอ่านมาถึงตรงนี้แล้วหลายคนอาจจะสงสัยว่าแบบนี้ก็มีด้วยเหรอ?\n\n**มีจริงครับ**\n\nส่วนหลังของบทความนี้จะอธิบายต่อว่าทำไม model ธุรกิจของ Celsius ถึงยั่งยืนและทำได้ตามที่กล่าวจริง โดยจะเริ่มอธิบายจากดอกเบี้ยที่ Celsius จ่ายคืนให้กับผู้ใช้งานดอกเบี้ยของ Celsius Network มาจากไหน?\n\nตามที่บอกไปข้างต้น Celsius Network จะนำกำไร 80% ของบริษัทมาจ่ายดอกเบี้ยคืนให้กับผู้ใช้ที่ฝาก crypto เข้าระบบทุกสัปดาห์\n\nอ่านไม่ผิดครับ 80%!\n\nซึ่งนี่เป็นสิ่งที่ทำให้ Celsius Network แตกต่างจาก project เพราะว่าหนึ่งในพันธกิจของบริษัทคือจะใช้กำไรแค่ 20% ในการบริหารธุรกิจ ซึ่งขนาดทำแบบนี้แล้วบริษัทก็ยังทำกำไรต่อเนื่องครับเจ๋งใช่มั้ยล่ะ\n\nที่เป็นแบบนี้ได้ เราต้องเข้าใจว่า Celsius Networks เป็นบริษัทที่เน้นการปล่อยกู้ crypto ครับ และกำไรส่วนมากก็มาจากตรงนั้น เวลาเราฝากเหรียญ crypto ของเราไปที่ Celsius เหรียญของเราจะถูกนำไปรวมกันเป็น pool ของเหรียญชนิดเดียวกัน จากนั้นบริษัทก็จะเอาเหรียญนั้นไปให้สถาบันการเงินกู้ยืม และคิดดอกเบี้ยการกู้ยืมจากสถาบันการเงินนั้น และดอกเบี้ยตรงส่วนนี้คือรายได้หลักของ Celsius เมื่อ Celsius ได้เงินมาจากนักลงทุนสถาบัน บริษัทก็จะเอา 80% ของรายได้มาซื้อ crypto เพื่อมาจ่ายดอกเบี้ยให้กับเราที่เป็นผู้ใช้งาน\n\n## ความเสี่ยงของธุรกิจกู้ยืม crypto มีอะไรบ้าง?\n\nความเสี่ยงหลักของเจ้าหนี้รึผู้ให้ยืมเงินคือลูกหนี้รึผู้ยืมเงินไม่ยอมจ่ายหนี้คืนครับ ซึ่งทาง Celsius Network ก็มีการรับมือความเสี่ยงนี้แล้วด้วยวิธีที่เรียกว่า over-collateralized loans (หลักประกันแบบเกิน)โดยมีรายละเอียดคือ ผู้ขอยืมเงินจาก Celsius จะต้องนำหลักประกันมาค้ำไว้ ตามตัวอย่างข้างล่างนี้\n\nสมมติว่า มีบริษัท A ต้องการยืม 100 Bitcoin จาก Celsius และในตอนนั้น ราคาของ 1 Bitcoin คือ $10,000 แสดงว่าจำนวนหนี้ที่ทางบริษัทยืมไปคือ $1,000,000 (100 BTC x 10,000)การที่บริษัท A จะยืมเงินจาก Celsius ได้ บริษัทต้องนำหลักประกันที่มีมูลค่ามากกว่า $2.000.000 มาค้ำประกันไว้ โดยตรงนี้จะมีอัตรา Loan-To-Value (LTV) อยู่ที่ 50%ทีนี้ ถ้าราคาของ Bitcoin พุ่งขึ้นจาก $10.000 ไปที่ $11.000 ค่า LTV จะเปลี่ยนเป็น 55% และทาง Celsius Network จะแจ้ง margin call ไปยังบริษัท A เพื่อให้นำหลักประกันมาค้ำเพิ่มเพื่อให้กลับไปยัง 50% LTV ถ้าบริษัท A ไม่สามารถลดค่า LTV ลงได้ และค่าของ Bitcoin ยังงพุ่งสูงขึ้น (สมมติว่าพุ่งไปถึง) $15.000 ค่า LTV จะเป็น 75%\n\nถึงตอนนั้น Celsius Network จะทำการยึดทรัพย์ที่บริษัท A นำมาค้ำไว้ ($2.000.000) เพื่อนำ 100 BTC ที่ให้ยืมไปกลับคืนมา และมูลค่าของ BTC ตอนที่ยึดกลับมาก็จะเพิ่มจาก $1.000.000 เป็น $1.500.000 ตามราคาตลาด\n\nและเพื่อเพิ่มรายได้กว่าเดิม Celsius ยังมีอีกวิธีที่จะเพิ่มการหารายได้ นั่นคือ rehypothecation ครับ\n\n## ความเสี่ยงของ rehypothecation\n\nคำว่า rehypothecation เริ่มเป็นที่รู้จักเมื่อตอนที่ Lehman Brothers ล้มละลายและทำให้เกิดภาวะเศรษฐกิจถดถอยทั่วโลกในปี 2007(ผู้แปลพยายามหาคำไทยแล้ว เหมือนจะแปลว่า หลักประกันที่ได้จากการให้กู้ยืมเงินไไปใช้ต่อแต่ดูไม่ค่อยสื่อเท่าไหร่)\n\n\\*rehypethecation ไม่ใช่สิ่งที่แย่เสมอไป เป็นเหมือนกับเครื่องมือการทำเงินชนิดหนึ่ง ถ้าไม่เข้าใจ ก็จะเป็นการเพิ่มความเสี่ยงในการเสียเงินมากกว่าหลักของ rehypothecation คือ• เราจะเพิ่มสภาพคล่องจากสินทรัพย์ที่ถืออยู่ได้ไวแค่ไหน (How fast can I get liquidity from the assets I hold?)• ผู้ขอกู้ยืมเงินมีลักษณะเป็นยังไง? (What is the quality of the borrower?)• หนี้ที่ยืมไปถูกนำไปใช้กับผลิตภัณฑ์การการเงินอื่นๆอีกหรือเปล่า? (Are the loans used in other financial products?)\n\nโดยลูกหนี้ที่มีลักษณะแย่คือ• ลูกหนี้ที่ใช้เวลาในกู้ทุนคืนนาน• หนี้ถูกนำไปใช้กับผลิตภัณฑ์การการเงินอื่นๆที่เป็นแบบนี้ เพราะว่ามันมีโอกาสสูงที่ผู้ปล่อยกู้จะหมุนเงินไม่ทันครับ และนั่นเป็นสิ่งที่เกิดขึ้นในช่วงวิกฤติ subprimeในปี 2007 ในช่วงนั้น การที่ธนาคารจะผลิดสภาพคล่องได้ ธนาคารต้องขายบ้านที่ถูกนำมาค้ำประกันเพื่อกู้ยืมเงิน ซึ่งบ่านรึอสังหาริมทรัพย์นั้นไม่ใช่สินทรัพย์ที่มีสภาพคล่องสูงแต่แรกอยู่แล้ว ยิ่งไปกว่านั้น ธนาคารยังปล่อยกู้มากเกินไป และมีลูกหน้จำนวนมากที่ไม่สามารถชำระหนี้คืนได้ เลยเกิดเป็นวงจรอุบาทว์ในช่วงนั้นส่วนในกรณีของ Celsius Network สินทรัพย์ที่บริษัทดูแลจะมีสภาพคล่องสูงมาก เพราะว่าผู้ยืมหลักคือนักลงทุนสถาบัน และใช้วิธี over-collateralized เลยทำให้ทั้งสองฝ่ายมีความเสี่ยงลดลง\n\nทีนี้เรามาดูกันต่อว่า rehypothecation ทำงานยังไง\n\n## หลักการทำงานของ Rehypothecation\n\nสมมติว่า Celsius Network มี 1000 Bitcoin จากผู้ใช้งานเหรียญจำนวน 20% จะถูกเก็บไว้ใน cold storage เผื่อว่าผู้ใช้งานต้องการถอนเหรียญออกที่เหลือ 80% จะนำไปปล่อยกู้ต่อ (800 Bitcoin)\n\nเพื่อให้เข้าใจได้ง่ายขึ้น เราจะสมมติว่าราคา Bitcoin นั้นถูกตรึงไว้ที่ $10.000(ในความเป็นจริง ราคาจะมีความผันผวนตลอดครับ ซึ่งบริษัทจะใช้วิธีการคำนวณ LTV เพื่อปรับสมดุลอยู่แล้ว)\n\n*ขั้นตอนที่ 1*\n\nสถาบัน A ต้องการกู้ 200 Bitcoin ด้วยราคา $10.000 ต่อ Bitcoin มูลค่าของเหรียญที่จะยืมโดยรวมจะเท่ากับ $2.000.000 ดังนั้น สถาบัน A ต้องนำสินทรัพย์จำนวน $4.000.000 มาค้ำ เพื่อให้ได้ 50% LTV.จบขั้นตอนนี้ Celsius Network จะมี 600 Bitcoin เหลือให้สถาบันการเงินอื่นกู้ยืมต่อ และมีสินทรัพย์ที่สภาบัน A นำมาค้ำไว้อีก $4.000.000\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*puJqJIvN9DZprl4G)\n\n*ขั้นตอนที่ 2*\n\nCelsius Network ตัดสินใจที่จะทำ rehypothecate กับสินทรัพย์ที่ Institution A นำมาค้ำประกันทีนี้ สถาบัน B ต้องการกู้ยืมเงินจำนวน $2.000.000 และใช้ 400 Bitcoin เพื่อค้ำประกันCelsius Network ปล่อยกู้ให้สถาบัน B เป็นจำนวน $2.000.000 โดยใช้เงินค้ำประกันที่ได้จาก สถาบัน A และได้รับ 400 Bitcoin จากสถาบัน B ที่มี 50% LTV.ตอนนี้ Celsius Network จะมี 1000 Bitcoin (600 จากผู้ใช้งาน และ 400 จากB) และเงินค้ำประกันอีก $2.000.000 จาก A.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*u0FOOwk0ISllQ0X4)\n\n*ชั้นตอนที่ 3*\n\nสถาบัน C ต้องการกู้ยืม 300 Bitcoin โดยใช้เงิน $6.000.000 เพื่อค้ำประกัน และจะมี 50% LTV.ตอนนี้ Celsius จะมี 700 Bitcoin และ $8.000.000.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*iYoTAtXO6Ul86WnM)\n\nจะเห็นได้ว่า การที่บริษัทใช้หลัก over-collateralized จะทำให้บริษัทมีสินทรัพย์ไปหมุนต่อเยอะมากครับ\n\n*ขั้นตอนที่ 4*\n\nสมมติว่าผู้ใช้งานพร้อมใจกันถอนเหรียญออกในรวดเดียว คิดเป็น 800 Bitcoin Celsius Network ก็ยังสามารถจ่ายเหรียญคืนให้ผู้ใช้งานได้เพราะบริษัทยังมีสินทรัพย์ที่คิดเป็น 1,500 Bitcoin\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*Llv5uVlDBl5EZpf6)\n\n*ขั้นตอนที่ 5*\n\nทีนี้ ถ้าสถาบันฯ ต้องการพร้อมใจกันชำระหนี้ในช่วงเดียวกัน Celsius Network ก็ต้องจ่าย 800 Bitcoin คืนไป และจะมีเงินเหลือ $7.000.000 ซึ่งเทียบเท่ากับ 700 Bitcoin.\n\nสถาบัน A ชำระ 200 Bitcoin ที่ยืมไป และได้รับ $4.000.000 ที่นำมาค้ำไว้คืน Celsius Network จะมี 200 Bitcoin และสินทรัพย์ $3.000.000\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*hL-OqgP0yh4l_aOn)\n\n*ขั้นตอนที่ 6*\n\nสถาบัน B ชำระหนี้ $2.000.000 คืน และได้รับ 400 Bitcoin กลับคืนไป Celsius Network จะมีสินทรัพย์เหลือ $3.000.000.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*OQA13Dy35o4ZG49i)\n\n*ขั้นตอนที่ 7*\n\nสถาบัน C ชำระ 300 Bitcoin คืนและได้รับ $6.000.000 กลับคืนไป Celsius Network จะมี 300 Bitcoin และ $3.000.000 Celsius Network ก็จะ liquidating 300 Bitcoin ที่เพิ่งได้รับคืนมาเพื่อชำระ $6.000.000 คืนให้กับสถาบัน C\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*6uQP-W5WxB_MLOku)\n\nฉะนั้น จะเห็นได้ว่าต่อให้ผู้ใช้งานพร้อมใจกันแห่มาถอนเหรียญออกจนหมด และสถาบันฯพร้อมใจกันชำระเงินคืนในรวดเดียว Celsius ก็ยังสามารถหมุนเงินและเหรียญเพื่อไปจ่ายคืนให้กัยทุกคนได้ครับ\n\nหวังว่าบทความนี้จะมีประโยชน์นะครับ ถ้าใครสนใจใช้งาน Celsius Network. แนะนำว่าให้โหลดแอปจาก link ของผมด้านล่าง\n\nใส่โค้ด 149421c6fd แล้วฝากเงินเข้า wallet ด้วย crypto ตัวไหนก็ได้ให้มีมูลค่าอย่างน้อย$400 โดยไม่ถอนออก พอครบ 30 วัน จะได้เงินเพิ่ม $50 เป็น BTC ครับ\n\n[Link ลงทะเบียนกับ Celsius Network](https://หวังว่าบทความนี้จะมีประโยชน์นะครับ ถ้าใครสนใจใช้งาน Celsius Network. แนะนำว่าให้โหลดแอปจาก link ของผมด้านล่าง  ใส่โค้ด 149421c6fd แล้วฝากเงินเข้า wallet ด้วย crypto ตัวไหนก็ได้ให้มีมูลค่าอย่างน้อย$400 โดยไม่ถอนออก พอครบ 30 วัน จะได้เงินเพิ่ม $50 เป็น BTC ครับ  Link เพื่อลงทะเบียนกับ Celsius Network)", "timestamp": 1633465727, "digest": "1sp8w6SPxv5JuND-pe6yI-ksv9zEdRfu6PylpE8ZwI8", "contributor": "0x587fbE613C3cc991455f0EA531FF6006C0B8fD51"}

The more ambitious you are, the bigger the problems you seek out to solve.\n\nA problem, in this context, is defined as an unfulfilled desire — **there is something out there that you want and currently do not have.** Solving problems means fulfilling that desire and getting what you want.\n\nMost ambitious people never accomplish their dreams because they don’t understand the rules of the game or how it works. Worse, more never come to realize **they’re playing the wrong game to begin with.**\n\nThe main set of problems people set out to solve (i.e. the games they choose to play) are:\n\n1. **Goal attainment** (fulfilling desires/solving problems, accomplishing goals): this is the “game”\n2. **Fulfillment** (feeling good about ourselves as a result of actuating potential): this is the *real* game\n3. **Connection** (serving others, contributing to the group, feeling connected beyond ourselves): this is an extension of the game\n\nLet’s break each of these down further.\n\n### The “game”\n\nHere’s how the goal attainment “game” works:\n\n1. you start with `time` and `energy` as raw materials\n2. `time` and `energy` is expended through `behaviors` (actions you take; things you do or don’t do), which provide `information` through feedback\n3. resilient `information` (`knowledge`) is used to solve `problems`, which is `valuable`\n4. `value` generated from the `labor` of solving `problems` is primarily captured and exchanged through `social capital` and `financial capital`\n5. `capital` is reinvested into other forms of `leverage` to maximize `time` and `energy` so you can do more (solve more/bigger problems) with less\n6. you repeat the process above until you run out of `time` or realize there’s more to the game\n\nThe above process serves as the foundation for everything that revolves around our productive lives: health, psychology, education, media, work, business, economics, technology and more. Understanding this process and how to navigate/play it well is crucial and affords you the opportunity to spend your time how you’d like (important).\n\nHowever, this is **not** the full picture. Playing the “game” for the sake of attainment alone is a non-starter.\n\nThis is because humans are wired to endlessly desire (i.e. have problems) and seek to fulfill those desires (i.e. solve them). The irony is you could attain/accomplish everything you’ve ever wanted, and there would **still** be another thing to chase. This is what makes this particular game “infinite”.\n\nSometimes, people also play this particular “game” for the wrong reasons:\n\n[https://twitter.com/naval/status/1267179384886095873](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1267179384886095873)\n\nThe game, in its entirety, is extraordinarily difficult to navigate, let alone succeed in. Fortunately, the only thing preventing you from winning is a set of skills that **can** be learned. In future posts, I’ll cover what this looks like for the *real* game, and how innovations like crypto allow us to change the rules (and what you can do about it).\n\n[Subscribe](https://www.melvin.gg/) to follow along as I break these down. Let's win together.

This lets the DivineDAO team focus on building their community and their product, instead of worrying about the technical implementation of their DAO stack.\n\nDivineDAO will launch as a SZNS Album on October 14th, at which point users can become members by either participating in the $DIVINE token sale or offering their Divine Loot as tribute in exchange for $DIVINE tokens (more information to follow below).\n\n### What is DivineDAO\n\n**[DivineDAO](https://twitter.com/divine_dao)** was built to supercharge the Loot ecosystem, forming as a more inclusive effort for all original Divine Loot items, including the more scarce (and thus less developed) hoods, gloves, and slippers.\n\nDivineDAO's goal is to act as a bridge between multiple communities to increase collaboration, accumulate Divine Loot in a treasury governed by $DIVINE holders, collectively tell and create the lore and story for Divine, and use that governance power to help drive the rest of the Loot ecosystem.\n\nYou can learn more about DivineDAO's exciting plans [here](https://divinedao.medium.com/introducing-the-divine-city-460596889bfc).\n\n### **$DIVINE Token Sale**\n\nThe intrinsic value of $DIVINE goes beyond the rare Loot NFTs held in the DAO's treasury, conferring both membership and utility to Divine Loot holders through governance over the DAO as a whole.\n\nThe $DIVINE Album Token Sale will commence Thursday, October 14th, 2021 at 12:00PM PST on SZNS and will run for a duration of seven (7) days. 8,000,000 $DIVINE will be available for sale for 0.000041625 ETH each, for a total raise of 333 ETH.\n\nAnyone can participate in the sale and join the DAO by connecting their wallet to [szns.io](http://szns.io) and purchasing their desired number of $DIVINE tokens.\n\n![Example UI flow for purchasing $DIVINE tokens on szns.io](https://storage.googleapis.com/szns-public/sznsdd-tokenbuy.gif)\n\nYou can read more information about the purchase process on SZNS [here](https://docs.szns.io/tutorials/buying-szntokens).\n\n### Divine Loot Tribute\n\nIn addition to purchasing $DIVINE via the Album Sale, anyone can join the DivineDAO via the [NFT Tribute process on SZNS](https://docs.szns.io/album-actions/nft-offering), where holders of Divine Loot can offer up their NFTs directly to the DAO in exchange for $DIVINE tokens.\n\nThis approach offers the opportunity to acquire $DIVINE without using additional capital. The SZNS UI makes it easy for anyone holding a small amount of $DIVINE tokens (a governance default for all Albums to prevent spam) to select their Divine Loot NFT, and submit a proposal to the DivineDAO for tribute. That sends a message to the DAO that requests that Divine Loot NFT be exchanged for a specified amount of $DIVINE. If the proposal is accepted, the NFT gets deposited into the DivineDAO treasury, and the user will be sent the requested number of $DIVINE.\n\nAt SZN-0 launch, the v1 of the SZNS protocol prioritizes security over all else, leading to a framework of two-week proposals (more on [our design choices here](https://szns.medium.com/szn-0-governance-overview-d9cb6e0e2dce)). While the SZNS interface offers the standard two-week proposal process (shown below) the DivineDAO plans to offer an expedited process for early contributors through an escrow process. More information on this will be shared shortly.\n\n![Example loop of an NFT Tribute on SZNS, where users can offer NFTs in exchange for a specified amount of Album Tokens.](https://storage.googleapis.com/szns-public/sznsdd-addnft.gif)\n\nWe're excited to work with DivineDAO to kick off the SZN-0 beta launch of the SZNS protocol and look forward to supporting more projects on collective NFT governance.\n\n### What's Next?\n\nOur site at <https://szns.io> will be going live shortly in a few days 👀 Come join the [SZNS Discord](https://discord.gg/szns) and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sznsNFT)!\n\nGet ready to join the DivineDAO by participating in the upcoming Album Sale on October 14th, 12:00PM PST.\n\nIn order to access the inner depths of the Divine City, you will need a Divine Key. DivineDAO has begun distributing these Keys to builders, artists, and patrons - if you would like to be considered to receive one, please apply [here](https://tally.so/r/meLKOn)!

Like, what in the fuck was going on here, basically.*  \\n - Thomas Pynchon, Inherent Vice\n\nI lay on a hotel bed in Amsterdam and watch villi and stitches on a huge sweater textured wallpaper move. Like worms, or waves, or chains, or snakes, or like a sweater. A wind blows and villi and stitches shake and bend. Left and right. Or right and left? I don't know. Too much movement. I should not distract myself. I should pay attention. What is attention after all? Does it mean being focused? To concentrate? To pay attention, eh? Why do we *pay* attention? Do they accept cards? No way. Attention cannot be money. This is ridiculous. English is weird.\n\nAnyway. Focus. Villi are moving. The grey-brown sweater is a meadow now, a grey-brown Chernobyl meadow, mesmerising, enthralling, but somehow familiar. I have been to hotels of the same brand before. Maybe they put this sweater wallpaper in every hotel of theirs, in every room. Maybe there is a factory that 3D-prints hotels with sweater wallpapers on the wall behind the bed. Then they got distributed all around Europe and maybe outside of it. I am not sure. Are there Ibis hotels in America? Write in the comments. The sweater is moving. It's like a cat now, a cat crossbred with an optical illusion. Can cats and optical illusions have sex and then have small little optically-illusionary kitties? I don't know.\n\n\"Mushrooms are not working,\" I say.\n\n\"Are you sure? Like for real?\" She giggles.\n\n\"I am. We should have gone for a stronger option.\"\n\n\"Are you disappointed?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\nA mushroom merchant had a catalogue. A colourful set of worn-out pages designed in Microsoft Word 2003 and WordArt.  Every page showed characteristics scales, like weapons, spells or items in video games but it was not +5 stamina and +100 intellect. It was quite the opposite. Vision, energy, something else I can't remember, are affected, supposedly in an *unusual* way. My bet wasn't on positive ways. I couldn't remember the exact names or brands of the mushrooms but they all had ‘Magic’ at the beginning of their names at the top and Latin names at the bottom of each page.\n\nWe went to Amsterdam for a few nights only. It was raining. No, incorrect word. It was pouring. It is better. Or bucketing down? The heavens had opened and were bucketing down on us. It is much, much better. We resembled a mushroom with a wide black cap and with two stalks, deluged from the top to bottom. Under one umbrella together, we were heading back to the hotel after a long walk through the old city centre. Then we saw an *Amanita muscari*a, like in Mario brothers, the one you eat and gain superpowers, in the game, though, in real life you die. It was a flat outdoor ad that invited us into the shop. Ads didn't affect us but we walked in, out of curiosity, of course. It was late. Did this guy had permission to sell mushrooms that late? Nevermind. The existence of the catalogue was enough to convince us. It was not like usual la carte, there was no mushroom soup, no mushroom risotto, and even no portobello mushroom burger. *Is that true that living people eat dead mushrooms but living mushrooms eat dead people*? I thought. We skimmed through the pages and decided to go for the simplest option. Perhaps, it was a good idea. Or not? We had never tried such a thing before. What if we forget to use all of it and leave some in our pockets and get arrested on border control? What if only Russian border control notice it? I did not want to go to a Russian prison. Agreed, the simplest version, the smallest portion. For two, please. Yes, card, please.\n\n\"Don't mix it with vodka\"\n\n*Why vodka?* I thought. Maybe the merchant recognised our Russian accent. Is it stereotypical to draw a connection between Russians and vodka? Is it racist? But *Russian* is a nationality, not a race. Should we get offended anyway? Perhaps, but the advice could still be spot on.\n\n\"And buy some sweets, chocolate or something\" We had that already. \"Eat it when you feel unwell or want the effect to ease.\" He actually cared about us. \"Have a good night\". The merchant smiled.\n\nFriends said we shouldn't get high outside (especially not with weed cupcakes). Otherwise, you can fall into a canal and die. We did not want that and so we went back to our room. We could not smoke joints in a hotel room so mushrooms seemed like a perfect option for the evening. It was bucketing down sideways, remember?\n\n\"Are you filming me?\"\n\n\"No. I am filming how mushrooms are not working.\" She laughs.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You have been staring at sweater on the wall for last like 20 minutes. I have got worried.\" She laughs.\n\nI laugh, too.\n\n\"Is that the reason for filming me?\"\n\n\"Quite so. You reminded me a philosopher. Whatever you are seeing there, can a sweater be that interesting?\"\n\n\"You said you are worried.\"\n\n\"I am, but you are seem very alright and it's funny\"\n\n\"I have never seen anything like that. The sweater, it's beautiful.\"\n\nShe laughs.\n\n\"Why? It's normal. What do you see?\"\n\n\"In no way it's normal. It's like… alive. Villi, stitches, they move, like a grass, like a fur on the wind. It's beautiful.\"\n\nShe laughs again, almost hysterically.\n\n\"Now I think that *my* mushrooms are not working.\"\n\nWe both laugh.\n\nIt tastes like walnut but almost tasteless, not tasty, a bit bitter, drier than a walnut, not oily at all, like a truffle maybe? Are we eating dried truffles? I should pay... I should have read la carte better. I put the last piece inside me.  I don't eat anything, do not drink water nor vodka. Did you know that *vodka (водка)* has the same root as *water*, *voda (вода)* in Russian? You know why? It's also transparent. Who am I talking to? Are you a sweater? Why are you here? Have you subscribed? Too many questions. I don't have time to answer them. The unreal reality is what's real right now. What if I am imagining you? What if you are just another stitch on the wall?\n\n\"Still doesn't work?\" I ask.\n\n\"No, nothing\"\n\n\"You shouldn't have eaten anything else.\"\n\n\"Maybe. I want to see the sweater, too.\"\n\n\"I heard it's personal.\"\n\n\"What is personal? The sweater?\"\n\n\"The effect.\"\n\n\"The effect of what?\"\n\n\"The effect of mushrooms and other stuff on your mind. People don't see the same things. Perhaps, yours isn't the sweater, you know?\"\n\nWe turn on a telly. It's Captain America. There's also Hulk there with the rest of the supernatural crew. They are Avengers. The second film. The one where they fight the AI robot that is too smart to bear humanity. Captain America speaks German. We laugh. We don't understand German. He speaks again. We laugh harder. It seems surreal. Captain America is not supposed to speak German but that's how humour works, right? We laugh. The AI speaks German, too. It feels utterly weird yet hilarious. We can't bear it anymore, not the film, not the language, but our laugh, and switch the channel.\n\nA breadman appears. His name is Bernd das Brot. He looks like a brick or a loaf of sourdough bread but has sad eyes and dangling glove-like hands as if they had no bones. He’s got wrinkles. How old is he? He sings, also in German. Is all TV in the Netherlands in German? Maybe it's not German? He has eyes, the breadman. Is he a superhero, too? “He was bitten by a sourdough when he was a kid. Now he is a friendly neighbour, a warden of the city.” He sings conveying his superheroic yeast-powered wisdom on how one should behave on a road. We still can't understand German, though, but it's obvious from the video sequence. We laugh, much harder than before. It is ridiculous, hilarious, bizarre, funny, and maybe some other adjectives.\n\n\"What happened? Switch back to the bread man.\" I say laughing.\n\n\"No way, my abs hurt. I can't do it anymore \"\n\n\"But he is a bread man. Please.\"\n\nShe switches it back.\n\nIt's not a comedy. It's a kids show. The breadman explains the better ways of living. It's educational. Is it self-help? It's 2 am. Why the kids show is shown so late? What's a time zone in Germany? The show ends. God, please, no Peppa pig. The breadman starts again. We laugh. Maybe it's just filling in the program during the night. Yes, it would make sense. We laugh more for the next hour or so. My abs also hurt. My neck hurts and it’s hard to breathe. Can one die of laughing? Can the breadman show be torture for junkies? An execution by laughing but without tickling? Am I a junkie now?\n\n\"You can't become a junkie after just one portion of mushrooms.\"\n\n\"That's what junkies say.\"\n\n\"It's just mushrooms.\"\n\n\"Junkies' famous last words.\"\n\nTime passes and I look at the sweater. It's gone. Not the sweater, villi and stitches aren't moving anymore.  The breadman is boring. Mushrooms have no power over me.\n\nWhat was it all? A glitch? A true reality? Are sweaters that beautiful? Am I missing something? I suddenly remember how Huxley described his psychedelic experience. In the *Doors Of Perception*, he introduced Mind At Large, or whatever was the name. Huxley said, by default, we are locked in our cages, cages we create for ourselves with experience, social status, beliefs and etc. These things limit our perception and define it. We cannot see the universe at its whole beauty and complexity. It would be overwhelming. Our brain locks it from us and locks us from it. It's a double cage. A cage inside a cage. A cage inside a cage inside a cage. A hyper-cage, a Nicolas Cage, a tesseract of cages. Whatever it is, I wish it had a sweater on the wall.\n\n*Ah, and, by the way, don't do drugs.*", "timestamp": 1633466245, "digest": "cMHbeJ6ENqKEDa06cKlcnL9yRxs119MVTG8eitKTwj8", "contributor": "0xa1445513D87606874E7A8C714EEA6A9cE49c0eE5"}

Under one umbrella together, we were heading back to the hotel after a long walk through the old city centre. Then we saw an *Amanita muscari*a, like in Mario brothers, the one you eat and gain superpowers, in the game, though, in real life you die. It was a flat outdoor ad that invited us into the shop.

The existence of the catalogue was enough to convince us. It was not like usual la carte, there was no mushroom soup, no mushroom risotto, and even no portobello mushroom burger. *Is that true that living people eat dead mushrooms but living mushrooms eat dead people*? I thought. We skimmed through the pages and decided to go for the simplest option. Perhaps, it was a good idea. Or not? We had never tried such a thing before.

{"id": "YafKDO4dbBACsUoMyqWraBeN6Qjh5EwN7ZG1sVdvBhI", "title": "Wishing for the Pre-Mine IDO", "body": "(originally posted to medium July 20 - 5min) \n\n**Background**\n\nIn 2017, Ethereum powered a flood of Initial Coin Offerings or ICOs which combined to raise over $5B and completely revolutionize blockchain-based fundraising. By 2018, that number was $20B. Even amidst a myriad of caveats like:\n\n* beware of scams\n* watch out for the SEC\n* lookout for projects building without investor-gated milestones\n* here’s hoping you guessed right on the design of the tokenomics pre-launch\n\nif ICOs were all Ethereum ever did, it would be a remarkable innovation.\n\nI think I heard somewhere — if you had invested in every ICO you would have made money. Not sure that could have been remotely possible, but while the flood of early ICOs engendered a lot of flack, the protocols and companies leading today’s groundbreaking revolutions (DeFi, NFTs, Web3, etc.) were largely built on the back of ICOs. And since that time, the ICO itself has evolved to include Token Generating Events, SAFTs, Security Token Offerings, Liquidity Generating Events, Initial Exchange Offerings, and Initial Dex Offerings (at least). Each offers a unique set of pros and cons that allow non-US entrepreneurs the freedom to select a fundraising path tailored to their project.\n\nWe’re here to suggest yet another route.\n\n**SAFE, SAFT, and the Pre-Mine IDO**\n\nStartups often take advantage of something called a SAFE- the Simple Agreement for Future Equity. The theory here is that brand new startups are difficult to price. Rather than raising $X at a specific enterprise value before getting data on tiny things like product-market-fit or total addressable market, the SAFE allows startups to raise money in return for an agreement to issue equity to investors in the subsequent priced round. Typically, this includes a discount to account for the risk of investing early and/or a cap to put an upper bound on extreme investor dilution. But, the specific mechanics are flexible and the agreement is intentionally simple (adding the additional benefit of lower legal costs).\n\nThe beauty of the SAFE is startups and investors can affordably raise and minimize the risks associated with pricing an early-round inefficiently where one side gets too much equity or the relationship gets otherwise mired with investor provisions.\n\nThe SAFT emerged to bring the power of the SAFE to blockchain projects. It was quickly shut down by regulators who pointed out it was just a security offering by another name. The SAFT avoided the requirement to lock in tokenomics because you weren’t issuing a token. Premature tokenization doesn’t just mess with the cap table, it messes with the mechanics of the entire project. If the project happens to be similar to an existing project, this might not be a concern, but if you are building something new, locking in the game-theoretical mechanics is reckless. For example, what if it turns out an inflationary issuance model would have worked better? What if there’s an opportunity for the community to engage but they are turned off by massive founder grants? Alternatively, what if big grants are needed to attract the initial team?\n\nThere is a disturbing trend in the blockchain world where VCs capture the big gains from projects before public token allocations. A new and amazing project might have been discovered by a smart community member, but that project will have achieved a massive market cap in the private markets before said community member can invest. Frankly, it’s un-American. I earned my dollar, how can you tell me I can’t invest it. SAFTs fail in this regard because they require accredited investors. SAFTs are also paper documents with only the promise for future tokens. So, if you need an actual token for utility or governance, a SAFT will not do. New Jobs Act options like Reg CF and Reg A similarly don’t work due to the tradeable nature of tokens.\n\nHere is where the pre-mine IDO shines. Like an IDO, placeholder tokens become immediately available on decentralized exchanges. This democratizes access to the upside. But, like a SAFT, locked tokenomics are replaced with clear communication that the pre-mine IDO token will be replaced at a future date.\n\nSo, could you even issue a token without setting the tokenomics? It is Ethereum we are talking about here, so… yes. Could you equitably build a liquid community from the start? The answer there has to be yes. Would projects benefit from being able to adjust mechanics according to product-market fit? The project has to benefit, but this lack of certainty does bring additional investor risk.\n\nWe’ll need some guardrails.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nIssue a litepaper that outlines the opportunity and the “planned” tokenomics. This manages expectations but allows for modification as a project develops a community and experiences the market.\n\nIssue a statement about funding goals of the Premine IDO adding details like investor provisions and the number of tokens to be airdropped to the team and community.\n\nInvestor provisions could include the promise to issue a detailed statement including locked tokenomics and roadmap seven days prior to the next token allocation. Promise to grant token holders who bought during the pre-mine IDO an air-drop of new tokens to ensure they have a 1.25X ROI on any tokens that have never been swapped.\n\nIf you are actively trading in and out of the token, you void any rights to investor protections. If the token has a greater than 25% price appreciation there will be no need for the 25% investor protection. You got in early, and you made money because you were early. By issuing a statement that includes the official tokenomics and roadmap seven days prior to the token allocation that follows the pre-mine IDO, investors have time to sell their tokens in the case that they don’t like the direction, or tokenomics, or are concerned about a rug-pull. Of course, once the IDO starts they might not get back in if they do sell.\n\nSell tokens directly to early investors. Airdrop tokens to community and team. Shout from the hilltops. And, let the decentralized exchanges do their thing.\n\nRelax and build.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, projects differ, motivations differ, and access to capital differs. Maybe the guardrails need refinement. Maybe most projects are better suited to existing token allocation schemes. We think there’s value in allowing teams the wisdom of time to refine their tokenomics. We think there’s value in prioritizing equal access to equity, right from the start.\n\nAlas, US regulations aren’t there yet. For now, we will opt for a standard seed round backed by a traditional SAFE. $WRK is a utility token. They will inevitably hit decentralized exchanges once used in our platform no matter what we try to do to stop them. Our investors will not benefit from that liquidity.\n\nMaybe someday someone will challenge these laws on the grounds that they stifle innovation, perpetuate the wealth gap, and unconstitutionally restrict people’s rights to the free and reasonable use of their capital.\n\nMaybe someday we’ll see pre-mine IDOs.", "timestamp": 1633466973, "digest": "YDnlF7tWld9bvIXW678qJZAh874ygA_7afZrMAPTw7c", "contributor": "0x6C71BAcDaAB54B4Bcb87019A292Fd1f27d0F7C08"}

Just finding a solution with a difficult person will feel like a win!\n\n### Treat yourself\n\nSuccessfully handling a difficult person is one of life's hardest tasks.

{"id": "9FzRo2XshgdgmDgeu8MnPaBUlmiDo67S9klsBzhj8Hw", "title": "6 Ways to Turn a Failure into a Success ", "body": "You’ve probably heard the story about Michael Jordan being cut from his freshmen basketball team or the one about how Thomas Edison failed 1,000 times before finally inventing the light bulb. The truth is, there are millions of stories like this in everyday life – people that took a perceived “failure” and used that as motivation to reach their own success.\n\nI like to refer to these failures as “perceived failures” because in reality, they were not failures at all – they were the catalyst that ultimately led to success. It could be argued that many successes would not exist at all without failing first.\n\nHere are 6 ways to turn your next failure into a success.\n\n## 1. Celebrate your failures\n\nThis celebration of failure is becoming more and more common in the top workplaces of today (think innovative tech companies). They encourage their employees to openly share their failures and some actually reward them for taking the risk in the first place. If you don’t reward yourself for failing, you won’t allow yourself to get outside your comfort zone – where the real growth happens.\n\n## 2. Identify failure as a stepping stone\n\nThe common belief is that failure should be avoided at all costs, this is dangerous. Instead of always trying to avoid it, reframe your mindset to make failure your direct path to ultimately reaching your success. You have to tell yourself that failure and success are not opposites, but are two points on the way to reaching our goals.\n\n## 3. Get consistent\n\nThere is a good chance that if you are doing something new or challenging you’re going to fail at first. Think about the first time you tried to ride a bike or ice skate…most certainly you failed time and time again before eventually succeeding at it. We can learn a lot by applying that same child-like consistency to our goals. Yes, you will fail, but the more and more you practice and persist on, the more success you’ll achieve.\n\n## 4. Team up\n\nFind a friend, family member, co-worker, etc. that may be interested in reaching the same goal as you. Having a partner who is going through the same failures as you will help bring both of you to success. If you can’t find someone who wants to achieve with you, instead look for a coach / mentor that can help you get there.\n\n## 5. Focus on the present\n\nI know it’s easy to just sit and think about how you’ve continued to fail and all of the things you did wrong. It’s ok to analyze your failures, but only as a way to learn from them – do not hang on to your failures as a way to become negative about what you are doing. The past is a great tool to learn from, but is the antithesis to living in the present moment (where the success actually happens).\n\n## 6. Develop a “growth mindset”\n\nOpposed to living with a fixed mindset, where you can’t learn and grow from your mistakes, growth mindset “people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.” – Carol Dweck (Check out her book “Mindset: The New Psychology of Success”). Living life with a growth mindset is a competitive advantage compared to most people that think people just “get lucky” or are “born with certain talents”.", "timestamp": 1633468190, "digest": "NEfuakYN4iAs-51siYskDwAy6mnZe_FsF-OTFOxfV7g", "contributor": "0xfb14157B0E4AadA6C6C24bea753C8FD6D27c850C"}

{"id": "EttytxXMnWxFTVbKtiiUeXpOnJ8qSrAU8AgBSPmoONE", "title": "Another Stitch On The Wall", "body": "> *Questions arose. Like, what in the fuck was going on here, basically.* - Thomas Pynchon, Inherent Vice\n\nI lay on a hotel bed in Amsterdam and watch villi and stitches on a huge sweater textured wallpaper move. Like worms, or waves, or chains, or snakes, or like a sweater. A wind blows and villi and stitches shake and bend. Left and right. Or right and left? I don't know. Too much movement. I should not distract myself. I should pay attention. What is attention after all? Does it mean being focused? To concentrate? To pay attention, eh? Why do we *pay* attention? Do they accept cards? No way. Attention cannot be money. This is ridiculous. English is weird.\n\nAnyway. Focus. Villi are moving. The grey-brown sweater is a meadow now, a grey-brown Chernobyl meadow, mesmerising, enthralling, but somehow familiar. I have been to hotels of the same brand before. Maybe they put this sweater wallpaper in every hotel of theirs, in every room. Maybe there is a factory that 3D-prints hotels with sweater wallpapers on the wall behind the bed. Then they got distributed all around Europe and maybe outside of it. I am not sure. Are there Ibis hotels in America? Write in the comments. The sweater is moving. It's like a cat now, a cat crossbred with an optical illusion. Can cats and optical illusions have sex and then have small little optically-illusionary kitties? I don't know.\n\n\"Mushrooms are not working,\" I say.\n\n\"Are you sure? Like for real?\" She giggles.\n\n\"I am. We should have gone for a stronger option.\"\n\n\"Are you disappointed?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\nA mushroom merchant had a catalogue. A colourful set of worn-out pages designed in Microsoft Word 2003 and WordArt.  Every page showed characteristics scales, like weapons, spells or items in video games but it was not +5 stamina and +100 intellect. It was quite the opposite. Vision, energy, something else I can't remember, are affected, supposedly in an *unusual* way. My bet wasn't on positive ways. I couldn't remember the exact names or brands of the mushrooms but they all had ‘Magic’ at the beginning of their names at the top and Latin names at the bottom of each page.\n\nWe went to Amsterdam for a few nights only. It was raining. No, incorrect word. It was pouring. It is better. Or bucketing down? The heavens had opened and were bucketing down on us. It is much, much better. We resembled a mushroom with a wide black cap and with two stalks, deluged from the top to bottom. Under one umbrella together, we were heading back to the hotel after a long walk through the old city centre. Then we saw an *Amanita muscari*a, like in Mario brothers, the one you eat and gain superpowers, in the game, though, in real life you die. It was a flat outdoor ad that invited us into the shop. Ads didn't affect us but we walked in, out of curiosity, of course. It was late. Did this guy had permission to sell mushrooms that late? Nevermind. The existence of the catalogue was enough to convince us. It was not like usual la carte, there was no mushroom soup, no mushroom risotto, and even no portobello mushroom burger. *Is that true that living people eat dead mushrooms but living mushrooms eat dead people*? I thought. We skimmed through the pages and decided to go for the simplest option. Perhaps, it was a good idea. Or not? We had never tried such a thing before. What if we forget to use all of it and leave some in our pockets and get arrested on border control? What if only Russian border control notice it? I did not want to go to a Russian prison. Agreed, the simplest version, the smallest portion. For two, please. Yes, card, please.\n\n\"Don't mix it with vodka\"\n\n*Why vodka?* I thought. Maybe the merchant recognised our Russian accent.

{"id": "f76SdUB_PMU18QTOVGbEchr9BXusjT88zInaC3mxeQ4", "title": "Motherland", "body": "So many of us grow up as “others”. Questioning where we fit in, who our tribe is and how our identity meets the world. For me, this was the story of much of my life as a Japanese-New Zealander who was never Japanese enough to be Japanese, or white enough to be white. My teenage love of jazz, hip hop and drum’n’bass all stemmed from the same needs - these were music forms where I could find comfort and community through diving into albums created from artists’ own searches for belonging and identity: sonic offerings that decried the status quo and mainstream seeking something more. This premise has been my foundation as an artist - creating music that looks to answer my own inner questions and reflect the world I see, while knowing that emulating the status quo does little to help me understand my own past, present and future.\n\n**Motherland** is a 43-minute film, a meditative audio-visual exploration of my Japanese ancestry and culture. Presented as both a **super-NFT film** and **audio NFTs**, Motherland features my Japanese roots-inspired music through a solo performance, set to footage shot during an artist residency in Kaga, Japan, during Summer 2019. It’s a series of instrumental tone-poems and immersive audio-visual moments to let your imagination play.\n\nThe collector of the super-NFT Motherland film will also receive **additional content** and an **equity share in the entire collection’s revenue** (more about that below). As well as sharing the project to share my art, I’m excited to experiment with different ways to present, share and incentivize music in the web3 space.\n\n***\\* Due to file size, please allow up to two minutes for the film to buffer before it plays***\n\n[auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?tokenId=3750](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?tokenId=3750)\n\n## The Film\n\nWe begin **Motherland** on the train ride to Kaga, and then on to an immersive journey of soundtracked sights following outdoor pathways to temples, rivers and lakes, accompanied by the sounds of nature and the eight compositions.\n\nThe footage of Japan featured in the film was shot in two locations - **Kakusenkei Gorge**, a beautiful forested valley with a river running between, and **Natadera Temple** - a Buddhist temple established in 714 AD with sprawling grounds, temple buildings and a distinct feeling of spiritual homeland. Along with the visuals, I’ve incorporated all the field-sound - the summer breeze rustling the trees, cicada song in the air, and the river’s running water. These create an integral connecting of the music with the visuals, and underpin the film with the sonic signature of nature.\n\nEach composition included in the film is introduced with *shodo* (traditional Japanese calligraphy) by visual artist **Kuniharu Yoshida**. The visual of the shodo and sight of Kuniharu’s hand in motion captures so much of the spirit of ancestry and roots which this project focuses on, and I’m grateful to have his contributions here.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AoIkXLj3xAHG5cTHi10qm.jpg?height=1348&width=2396)\n\n## The Music\n\n**Motherland** features eight instrumental compositions. Each piece has its own story - shared in storytime twitter threads:\n\n1. Motherland \\[[storytime](https://twitter.com/MdCL/status/1412113085381287942)\\]\n2.

Where some of my work dives heavily into beat-culture and the dancefloor, Motherland is an introspective offering, leaning primarily on the sound of the piano and subtle use of electronics to tell the story.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vYH2K0udctxqI46gcBVIG.jpg?height=1324&width=2552)\n\n## The NFT Collection\n\nMotherland is a deeply personal project for me and it’s important to present it in a way that preserves this meaning. Shout-out to my friend [Sirsu](https://twitter.com/sirsuhayb) who helped me put this collection together and encouraged and supported me to enter the NFT space.\n\nThe collection consists of the super-NFT film, eight 1-of-1 individual-track audio NFTs, fifty open-edition digital mixtape NFTs and four (only 4!) hand-pressed, translucent vinyl commemorative pressings. No more vinyl will be pressed.\n\nThe winning collector of the **Motherland Film** **Super-NFT** will receive:\n\n* **the full-res film** digital file (non-commercial use only)\n* **individual WAV files** for all eight audio pieces (non-commercial use only)\n* edition #1 of the **hand-pressed translucent vinyl**\n* **equity share of all sales** of the audio NFTs consisting of: 5% royalty share on all eight 1-of-1 single-audio NFTs + 2% royalty share on the open edition Motherland digital mixtape NFTs. The assigned share from primary sales is held in wallet [0xbd5E9c1C43Ded1E9656e24281Ad378F9Ab364A64](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbd5E9c1C43Ded1E9656e24281Ad378F9Ab364A64), for transfer to the winning collector. Secondary sales will be credited via a new smart contract.\n\nEvery bidder on the **Motherland** **Film Super-NFT** will also go in a draw to win edition #2 of the hand-pressed translucent vinyl (to be drawn following a successful auction).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/w-kQfpxZKMfuUf2ADWTDs.jpg?height=1080&width=1080)\n\n## The 1-of-1 Audio NFTs\n\nEach of the film’s eight pieces of music has been minted as a 1-of-1 audio NFT. [Auctions hosted on Catalog/Zora](https://catalog.works/mdcl).\n\nEvery bidder on any of the audio NFTs will also go in a draw to win edition #3 of the hand-pressed translucent vinyl (to be drawn when all eight 1-of-1 audio NFT auctions close or one year after initial minting, whichever is sooner).\n\n5% of all sales of these NFTs will be credited to the collector of the film super-NFT.

Like, what in the fuck was going on here, basically.* - Thomas Pynchon, Inherent Vice\n\nI lay on a hotel bed in Amsterdam and watch villi and stitches on a huge sweater textured wallpaper move. Like worms, or waves, or chains, or snakes, or like a sweater. A wind blows and villi and stitches shake and bend. Left and right. Or right and left? I don't know. Too much movement. I should not distract myself. I should pay attention. What is attention after all? Does it mean being focused? To concentrate? To pay attention, eh? Why do we *pay* attention? Do they accept cards? No way. Attention cannot be money. This is ridiculous. English is weird.\n\nAnyway. Focus. Villi are moving. The grey-brown sweater is a meadow now, a grey-brown Chernobyl meadow, mesmerising, enthralling, but somehow familiar. I have been to hotels of the same brand before. Maybe they put this sweater wallpaper in every hotel of theirs, in every room. Maybe there is a factory that 3D-prints hotels with sweater wallpapers on the wall behind the bed. Then they got distributed all around Europe and maybe outside of it. I am not sure. Are there Ibis hotels in America? Write in the comments. The sweater is moving. It's like a cat now, a cat crossbred with an optical illusion. Can cats and optical illusions have sex and then have small little optically-illusionary kitties? I don't know.\n\n\"Mushrooms are not working,\" I say.\n\n\"Are you sure? Like for real?\" She giggles.\n\n\"I am. We should have gone for a stronger option.\"\n\n\"Are you disappointed?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\nA mushroom merchant had a catalogue. A colourful set of worn-out pages designed in Microsoft Word 2003 and WordArt.  Every page showed characteristics scales, like weapons, spells or items in video games but it was not +5 stamina and +100 intellect. It was quite the opposite. Vision, energy, something else I can't remember, are affected, supposedly in an *unusual* way. My bet wasn't on positive ways. I couldn't remember the exact names or brands of the mushrooms but they all had ‘Magic’ at the beginning of their names at the top and Latin names at the bottom of each page.\n\nWe went to Amsterdam for a few nights only. It was raining. No, incorrect word. It was pouring. It is better. Or bucketing down? The heavens had opened and were bucketing down on us. It is much, much better. We resembled a mushroom with a wide black cap and with two stalks, deluged from the top to bottom. Under one umbrella together, we were heading back to the hotel after a long walk through the old city centre. Then we saw an *Amanita muscari*a, like in Mario brothers, the one you eat and gain superpowers, in the game, though, in real life you die. It was a flat outdoor ad that invited us into the shop. Ads didn't affect us but we walked in, out of curiosity, of course. It was late. Did this guy had permission to sell mushrooms that late? Nevermind. The existence of the catalogue was enough to convince us. It was not like usual la carte, there was no mushroom soup, no mushroom risotto, and even no portobello mushroom burger. *Is that true that living people eat dead mushrooms but living mushrooms eat dead people*? I thought. We skimmed through the pages and decided to go for the simplest option. Perhaps, it was a good idea. Or not? We had never tried such a thing before. What if we forget to use all of it and leave some in our pockets and get arrested on border control? What if only Russian border control notice it? I did not want to go to a Russian prison. Agreed, the simplest version, the smallest portion. For two, please. Yes, card, please.\n\n\"Don't mix it with vodka\"\n\n*Why vodka?* I thought. Maybe the merchant recognised our Russian accent. Is it stereotypical to draw a connection between Russians and vodka? Is it racist? But *Russian* is a nationality, not a race. Should we get offended anyway? Perhaps, but the advice could still be spot on.\n\n\"And buy some sweets, chocolate or something\" We had that already. \"Eat it when you feel unwell or want the effect to ease.\" He actually cared about us. \"Have a good night\". The merchant smiled.\n\nFriends said we shouldn't get high outside (especially not with weed cupcakes). Otherwise, you can fall into a canal and die. We did not want that and so we went back to our room. We could not smoke joints in a hotel room so mushrooms seemed like a perfect option for the evening.

Celebrate your failures\n\nThis celebration of failure is becoming more and more common in the top workplaces of today (think innovative tech companies). They encourage their employees to openly share their failures and some actually reward them for taking the risk in the first place. If you don’t reward yourself for failing, you won’t allow yourself to get outside your comfort zone – where the real growth happens.\n\n## 2. Identify failure as a stepping stone\n\nThe common belief is that failure should be avoided at all costs, this is dangerous. Instead of always trying to avoid it, reframe your mindset to make failure your direct path to ultimately reaching your success. You have to tell yourself that failure and success are not opposites, but are two points on the way to reaching our goals.\n\n## 3. Get consistent\n\nThere is a good chance that if you are doing something new or challenging you’re going to fail at first. Think about the first time you tried to ride a bike or ice skate…most certainly you failed time and time again before eventually succeeding at it. We can learn a lot by applying that same child-like consistency to our goals. Yes, you will fail, but the more and more you practice and persist on, the more success you’ll achieve.\n\n## 4. Team up\n\nFind a friend, family member, co-worker, etc. that may be interested in reaching the same goal as you. Having a partner who is going through the same failures as you will help bring both of you to success. If you can’t find someone who wants to achieve with you, instead look for a coach / mentor that can help you get there.\n\n## 5. Focus on the present\n\nI know it’s easy to just sit and think about how you’ve continued to fail and all of the things you did wrong. It’s ok to analyze your failures, but only as a way to learn from them – do not hang on to your failures as a way to become negative about what you are doing. The past is a great tool to learn from, but is the antithesis to living in the present moment (where the success actually happens).\n\n## 6. Develop a “growth mindset”\n\nOpposed to living with a fixed mindset, where you can’t learn and grow from your mistakes, growth mindset “people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.” – Carol Dweck (Check out her book “Mindset: The New Psychology of Success”). Living life with a growth mindset is a competitive advantage compared to most people that think people just “get lucky” or are “born with certain talents”.", "timestamp": 1633468356, "digest": "NEfuakYN4iAs-51siYskDwAy6mnZe_FsF-OTFOxfV7g", "contributor": "0xfb14157B0E4AadA6C6C24bea753C8FD6D27c850C"}

Evolving gradually, from the colourful and busy profiles of MySpace  and personal websites to the carefully manicured and factory-style Facebook profiles, communication on the internet has seen rapid expansion. Now, ever since Satoshi Nakamoto published his inaugural whitepaper ‘[Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper)’ and a consortium of privacy concerns, a new standard for social has emerged: decentralization. This follows the natural progression from Web1 to Web2 and now what has been coined (no pun intended) as Web3. The somewhat expected and also necessary cultural revolution that ensued has led to a multitude of technological innovations, including smart contracts and defi to name a couple. This article proposes a new means of social communication on the internet and Ethereum blockchain: Ink.\n\n## $INK token / Governance\n\nInk as a protocol is at its core decentralized. This means we cannot allow for power abuse by moderators, let alone implement such as system. Although it is mentioned we may implement a simple filtering system below, it is important to us we stay uncensored. One way we maintain a quality reputation system is through our inbuilt utility token, $INK. The token is used for numerous things around the ecosystem, primarily reputation and governance. The token will be used to vote on proposals in the upcoming inkDAO, and maintain reputation through ways described in the ‘protocol’ section of the article. \n\n### Distribution / Access\n\nAccess to the platform is important to us. We will distribute $INK as an airdrop to users, as a ‘getting started’ amount, not as a periodic instalment. The protocol will provide a multitude of ways to earn $INK organically, and the 1 $INK airdrop will hopefully start interested users off with the platform. For every interaction with $INK on the platform, 30% will be burned. The token is also uncapped, meaning new tokens are minted, rather than used from a store / reused. The burn function stops inflation.\n\n## Principles\n\nWhilst building Ink we have tried to maintain and stick to a set of core values and principles, as to not deviate from the original goal of the protocol.\n\n* **Accessibility / Freedom of participation** The protocol should be accessible to anyone, regardless of IRL persona or capital. This may include the platform being made chain-agnostic, or including gasless transactions in future, as well as enabling nothing but an Ethereum wallet and $INK to access. (1 $INK will be airdropped free to users)\n* **Freedom of expression** The protocol should be free for anyone to express their thoughts, opinions and ideas, provided it doesn’t clash with the first principle. The official Ink frontend may include *some* built in censorship features to protect the average user, but the contract itself will be free to use and we would love to see users create their own secondary UI / frontends.\n* **Decentralization** The platform will be controlled not by one person but by its users. It will *not* be hosted on a server and will *not* be mediated or moderated by us (the core developers). Alongside this, all the code will be open source.\n\n## Protocol\n\nAt Ink, we are trying to design a  social protocol that aims to enhance the existing platforms of today and free users from the shackles of centralization. This requires both necessary and interesting new features, as well as an innovative new business model. We propose the protocol includes these features, some being added after the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is released.\n\n* **Posting.** Users can post to Ink freely. Put at a high level, posting is simply pushing to the `postIndex`mapping. Posting on Ink is different to posting on a traditional social platform in two key ways. Firstly, posts have the ability to receive $INK. This is displayed on your post and is key to the protocol remaining free from bad actors and bots. Secondly, the poster has the ability to mint their posts as an NFT, meaning it can be owned and published immutably on the blockchain, solving power abuse issues traditional platforms’ users have had to succumb to.\n* **Follow / unfollow** This is somewhat secondary to the $INK token, due to the somewhat artificial click of a button, versus the thoughtful gift of something that holds monetary value as well as utility. Despite this, the platform will still have a way of following creators as a method of feed curation and keeping tabs on friends and community members\n* **Tip posts / users** The protocol will allow users to tip other users and posts in our utility token, $INK. This again prevents bad actors and bots from abusing the platform (read up on [reputation](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/aXm3OTVTK26hN2QKu82s8NjLQYPKCOMiVD2zIioCOVU) in web3 here), as well as a way to incentivize and pay independent creators.\n* **Social tokens / Group chat** *(post MVP)* One aspect that could revolutionize the creator economy and internet is tokenized communities. This provides a means of truly decentralized creation and support, as well as a fun way to interact with your community. We propose a token-gated chat and DM feature for Ink, as well as token gated posts. This feature will hopefully be released after our initial v1 product or MVP.\n\nHopefully, Ink will migrate to a DAO structure, enabling true decentralization and participation. Whilst we are still raising funds and developing the product, we are remaining as a decentralized community / project not a DAO, as to speed up development and ensure the product is as perfect as possible.\n\n## Channels\n\nStay in touch with us.

SZNS gives DivineDAO the ability to operate with a DAO framework built on the $DIVINE token, for community governance and management.\n\nAt the core of the SZNS platform are Albums, which are collections of NFTs that are governed by the Album tokenholders. Albums enable both fractional ownership and governance of high-value NFTs, opening up new opportunities for collective management of NFT baskets. You can read more about Albums [here](https://docs.szns.io/core-components/albums).\n\nDivineDAO selected SZNS as their platform because SZNS offers an out-of-the-box DAO toolkit for collectively-owned NFTs. This lets the DivineDAO team focus on building their community and their product, instead of worrying about the technical implementation of their DAO stack.\n\nDivineDAO will launch as a SZNS Album on October 14th, at which point users can become members by either participating in the $DIVINE token sale or offering their Divine Loot as tribute in exchange for $DIVINE tokens (more information to follow below).\n\n### What is DivineDAO\n\n**[DivineDAO](https://twitter.com/divine_dao)** was built to supercharge the Loot ecosystem, forming as a more inclusive effort for all original Divine Loot items, including the more scarce (and thus less developed) hoods, gloves, and slippers.\n\nDivineDAO's goal is to act as a bridge between multiple communities to increase collaboration, accumulate Divine Loot in a treasury governed by $DIVINE holders, collectively tell and create the lore and story for Divine, and use that governance power to help drive the rest of the Loot ecosystem.\n\nYou can learn more about DivineDAO's exciting plans [here](https://divinedao.medium.com/introducing-the-divine-city-460596889bfc).\n\n### **$DIVINE Token Sale**\n\nThe intrinsic value of $DIVINE goes beyond the rare Loot NFTs held in the DAO's treasury, conferring both membership and utility to Divine Loot holders through governance over the DAO as a whole.\n\nThe $DIVINE Album Token Sale will commence Thursday, October 14th, 2021 at 12:00PM PST on SZNS and will run for a duration of seven (7) days. 8,000,000 $DIVINE will be available for sale for 0.000041625 ETH each, for a total raise of 333 ETH.\n\nAnyone can participate in the sale and join the DAO by connecting their wallet to [szns.io](http://szns.io) and purchasing their desired number of $DIVINE tokens.\n\n![Example UI flow for purchasing $DIVINE tokens on szns.io](https://storage.googleapis.com/szns-public/sznsdd-tokenbuy.gif)\n\nYou can read more information about the purchase process on SZNS [here](https://docs.szns.io/tutorials/buying-szntokens).\n\n### Divine Loot Tribute\n\nIn addition to purchasing $DIVINE via the Album Sale, anyone can join the DivineDAO via the [NFT Tribute process on SZNS](https://docs.szns.io/album-actions/nft-offering), where holders of Divine Loot can offer up their NFTs directly to the DAO in exchange for $DIVINE tokens.\n\nThis approach offers the opportunity to acquire $DIVINE without using additional capital. The SZNS UI makes it easy for anyone holding a small amount of $DIVINE tokens (a governance default for all Albums to prevent spam) to select their Divine Loot NFT, and submit a proposal to the DivineDAO for tribute. That sends a message to the DAO that requests that Divine Loot NFT be exchanged for a specified amount of $DIVINE. If the proposal is accepted, the NFT gets deposited into the DivineDAO treasury, and the user will be sent the requested number of $DIVINE.\n\nAt SZN-0 launch, the v1 of the SZNS protocol prioritizes security over all else, leading to a framework of two-week proposals (more on [our design choices here](https://szns.medium.com/szn-0-governance-overview-d9cb6e0e2dce)). While the SZNS interface offers the standard two-week proposal process (shown below) the DivineDAO plans to offer an expedited process for early contributors through an escrow process. More information on this will be shared shortly.\n\n![Example loop of an NFT Tribute on SZNS, where users can offer NFTs in exchange for a specified amount of Album Tokens.](https://storage.googleapis.com/szns-public/sznsdd-addnft.gif)\n\nWe're excited to work with DivineDAO to kick off the SZN-0 beta launch of the SZNS protocol and look forward to supporting more projects on collective NFT governance.\n\n### What's Next?\n\nGet ready to join the DivineDAO by participating in the upcoming Album Sale on October 14th, 12:00PM PST.

{"id": "hw4pVezz69vqJp9_QUY3DxHEyYhp3BsnHEGTE_aXBpI", "title": "Beginner guide for first-time cryptocurrency buyers (2021)", "body": "I hope this article will bring you value and help you begin your cryptocurrency’s journey\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*o4B0xbYSEXTXINqk2vWluA.png)\n\nSome coins you will meet during your journey\n\nDecember 2020. My cousin starts sending me updates about the cryptocurrency markets. I watched videos about bitcoin 2 years ago. I was not really interested in it at that time. What caught my eyes during those updates in how the market fluctuated.\n\nAt that time, bitcoin just passed $25k. I didn’t understand why it keep going up and down. I needed to go deeper. I kept digging. I started watching Youtube videos about financial markets, trading basics, and blockchain/currency explanations. It was eye-opening.\n\nFrom then, I started my journey with cryptocurrencies. I started with $2.\n\nFrom there, my journey was a rollercoaster trip :\n\n* Tesla bought some bitcoin\n* Beeple sold his NFTs for 69 million of dollars\n* China cracks down miners in their country\n* Tesla stops accepting bitcoin\n* The market crashed in May 2021\n* El Salvador accepts bitcoin as a legal tender\n\nEvery single one of these events had an effect on the market.\n\nWhat kind of effect?\n\nLemme show you.\n\n## Understand market moves\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*dqswBfaNfUiTgEnL)\n\nPsychology of market cycle from Binance\n\nI went through all of those phases.\n\nPrices of assets go down and up depending on the market.\n\nA definition of a market is where people meet and exchange value.\n\nFor example :\n\n* in the stock market, people exchange shares with money.\n* in the bond market where participants can issue new [debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt), known as the [primary market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_market), or buy and sell debt [securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)), known as the [secondary market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_market).\n\nAnd now, the crypto market: you buy coins in exchange for fiat.\n\nThe number of people buying coins and the amount of people selling determines the market moves.\n\nYou can analyze the market move using two factors: **Technical analysis**: look at the chart for different indicators of a pattern.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*cv5HQb6Cs3pVe2ua.png)\n\nTypical chart view from tradingview.com\n\n**Fundamental analysis**: looks at the bigger picture, regulation, market cap, other news, or issues around a specific market. This methodology looks at the BTC value for example, as a technology regardless of the current price and its outside prices in order to determine what will happen.\n\nWith the understanding of these two basics analysis of market moves, lemme explain the market conditions.\n\n**Bull market :**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*z1G_i7F-Q52Lca6tDdnrFA.png)\n\nThe psychological effect of a bull market\n\nA [bull market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp) is a market that is on the rise and where the conditions of the economy are generally favorable.\n\nA bull market is typified by a sustained increase in prices. In the case of equity markets, a bull market denotes a rise in the prices of companies’ shares. In such times, investors often have faith that the [uptrend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptrend.asp) will continue over the long term. In this scenario, the country’s economy is typically strong and employment levels are high.\n\nIn the case of crypto market, it means the price per coin (in $) is going up.\n\n**Bear market :**\n\n![The psychological effect of a bear market](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*2XvHswIwpRSPX902IWdwMg.png)\n\nA bear market exists in an economy that is receding and where most stocks are declining in value.\n\nA [bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp) is one that is in decline. A market is usually not considered a true “bear” market unless it has fallen 20% or more from recent highs. In a bear market, share prices are continuously dropping. This results in a downward trend that investors believe will continue; this belief, in turn, perpetuates the downward spiral. During a bear market, the economy slows down and unemployment rises as companies begin laying off workers.\n\nin the case of the crypto market, the price per coin is going down.\n\nBecause the financial markets are greatly influenced by investors’ attitudes, these terms also denote how investors feel about the market and the ensuing economic trends :\n\n> You are bullish if you believe that an asset will increase in price;\n>\n> You are bearish otherwise.\n\nNow you understand the basics of market moves, let’s jump into the cryptocurrency market.\n\n## Cryptocurrency as an investment\n\nInvesting is different from trading.\n\n> Trading means you are for the short term market move. You take profit as soon as the market move the way you predict it. If you open a position saying the trend is going up (meaning you are taking a long position), once it does, you take profit. If not, you lose. If you open a position saying the trend is going down (meaning you are taking the short position), once it does, you take your profit. If not you lose\n\nLike I said in [my recent article](https://medium.com/coinmonks/beginner-guide-for-first-time-nfts-buyers-2021-7abecb8dd059), Bitcoin was created in the context of an economic crisis. Satoshi Nakamoto quotes :\n\n***The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible*.**\n\nThis was the beginning of a long road.\n\nIn 2008, an anonymous person called Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin. It’s money on the Internet, without banks, without a middle man.\n\n**First, what is money?**\n\nMoney is often defined in terms of the three **functions** or **services** that it provides :\n\n* **Medium of exchange**: Money’s most important function is as a medium of exchange to ease transactions. Without money, all transactions would have to be conducted by **barter.** It involves the direct exchange of one good or service for another.\n* **Store of value:** To be a medium of exchange, money must hold its value over time; that is, it must be a store of value. Otherwise, money could not be stored for some period and remain valuable in exchange.\n* **Unit of account**: Money also functions as a unit of account, providing a *common measure of the value* of goods and services being exchanged.\n\nHow did Satoshi manage to create “Internet money” with these functions?\n\nHe leveraged something called **Blockchain**.\n\nBlockchain is a register where every transaction is recorded. Its characteristics :\n\n* **Immutability**: No possibility to make a change on the register once data is in the ledger.\n* **Decentralized**: No one owns the technology, it’s shared among the users.\n* **Anonymity**: You don’t need to give your credentials, a random password is given to you only.\n* **Security**: It’s almost impossible to hack because of the density of the network.\n\nWith it, Satoshi made Bitcoin. No possibility to double spend. A store of value. A medium of exchange. A unit of account. All combined using blockchain and cryptography.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin has exploded. After 13 years, a unit of bitcoin is now worth between $30k and $65k depending on the demand.\n\nIn 2015, a group of 8 persons figured out they can do more things with the blockchain: ***they can build some kind of contract on top of it***.\n\nGiven the fact that the blockchain is a register, what you put on it depends on the writer of the code. If they can figure out a way to codify functions and put it on the blockchain, they will have another use case.\n\n> And they made it. Ethereum was born.\n\nYou can create your coin(or token) like Bitcoin, determine the max supply, and release it in under 5 min, using something called **“Smart contract”**: lines of codes you write and deploy on the blockchain.\n\nIn January 2021, I programmed the first token I called “Wetchit” which means “spare change”. I couldn’t believe it. It took me less than 5 min :\n\n* I went on Youtube\n* Research “How to create a coin with Ethereum”\n* I watched the tutorial\n* Click on the Github link\n* Copy the code\n* Paste it on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)\n* I change the name of the token\n* Define the max supply, the abbreviation of the token name, the divisibility, and leave the rest unchanged.\n\nDone. I compile it. No error.\n\nNow, I connect my Metamask and it was ready to deploy.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn’t have enough Ethereum to pay gas fees.\n\nBut I had the option to test the coin on Kovan Test Network. I was working well. I sent some tokens to different wallets.\n\nI was like “WOW, this is the next thing”.\n\nDo you see how easy it was to create a token in under 5 min, with an open-source program?\n\nThat’s why you need to know some statistics.\n\n## Macro view of cryptocurrency market\n\nHere are the statistics in 09/21/2021, based on Coinmarketcap:\n\n* [12,037](https://coinmarketcap.com/) cryptocurrencies\n* [$1,828,977,121,702](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) market cap\n* [$139,985,252,175](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) 24h volume\n\n12,037 coins !!!!!!! That’s 66.8722222222 times the number of fiat currencies.\n\nKnowing cryptocurrency market follows the same market rules, how to choose the best ones to invest in?\n\nFirst, every coin has a cycle, like the figure from Binance above. We can group them into two categories :\n\n* Bitcoin season\n* Altcoin (all coins different from BTC) season\n\nWith the data record, scientists develop a model for the evolution of bitcoin, called the **Stock-To-Flow model**.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0\\*Xm_on3EwB4AOPcHP)\n\nStock-to-flow model of bitcoin\n\nIt represents the evolution of BTC since the beginning of its creation.\n\nIn the X-axis, you have Years, Y-axis you have the price per BTC.\n\nBitcoin has a 21 million coins supply. No more will be created.\n\n**If 75% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last 30 days it is Altcoin Month. Otherwise, it’s Bitcoin month.**\n\n**If 75% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last season (90 days) it is Altcoin Season. Otherwise, it’s Bitcoin season.**\n\n**If 75% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last year it is Altcoin Year. Otherwise, it’s Bitcoin year.**\n\nHere is an index to find out which season we are in [Blockchain Center index](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/altcoin-season-index/)\n\nThe macro view allows you to have a global view of the market.\n\n**Here is how to approach bitcoin and altcoin season from a macro perspective.**\n\nA great opportunity to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nCounterintuitive right?\n\nLemme explain.\n\nWhen you know everyone is buying a house from a specific location, what happens? Prices go up. You have then two choices :\n\n* FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): do whatever possible to have a slot for you (at a higher price with maybe a smaller slot because of the high demand)\n* Research an alternative to the location, not far and with a lower price.\n\nThat’s the same strategy here.\n\nIf it’s altcoin season, it means bitcoin is undervalued in some way. It’s ‘cheap’.\n\nWhen you buy an asset when it’s cheap, it gives you leverage to take profit sooner, when you needed.\n\nSame concept here. You want to invest in cheap options. In this case, it’s altcoins.\n\nNow, how do you choose which altcoin to invest in?\n\nHere is my methodology I called: ***themetapick***\n\n## How to invest in altcoins using themetapick strategy\n\n**12,036** altcoins. That’s a lot.\n\nHow to wrap your head around those?\n\n**1-Understand blockchain**\n\n**2-Understand cryptocurrency market (I gave you an overview, but you need to go deeper)**\n\nBegin here: [100 Tools and References to Begin with Blockchain and Cryptoassets (2021)](https://medium.com/coinmonks/100-tools-and-references-to-begin-with-blockchain-and-cryptoassets-2021-9d7efb5b4797)\n\n> **Do you homework for at least 50 hours.**\n\nAfter that you should be able to answer these questions :\n\n* What is a blockchain?\n* What is a market cycle?\n* What is the difference between bitcoin and Ethereum?\n* What is support? What is resistance?\n* What is a wallet? How to secure a wallet?\n* How to buy a coin? Where to buy a coin?\n* How to transfer a coin?\n* What is the difference between a cold wallet and a hot wallet?\n* What is a seed phrase? What is the difference between a seed phrase and a password?\n* What is the difference between Bitcoin and Dogecoin?\n* What is the difference between Dogecoin and Shiba INU?\n* What is the difference between Ethreum and the coin built on top of Ethreum?\n* What is a gas fee? What is a gas price? What is a gas?\n* What is the definition of circulating supply? What is the difference between circulating supply and max supply?\n* Why not buy a hardware wallet on Amazon or another third-party company? Why do you have to buy them from the company making it?\n* What is the best way to protect your coins?\n* What is the best way to lose your coins?\n* Why can’t you invest more than you can afford to lose?\n\nIf you cannot answer one of these questions after 50 hours, DM me on [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/themetaboy)or [Instagram](http://instagram.com/themetaboy), I will be happy to help.\n\nNow that you can answer all these questions. We can move forward.\n\nWhen It comes to investing, you have to consider 4 cases :\n\n\\*\\*Low risk/low reward potential: \\*\\*If you are a real risk-averse person, I suggest you look into the top 5 coins. You can find them on [Coinmarketcap](http://coinmarketcap.com/) or [coingecko](http://coingecko.com/).\n\n\\*\\*Low Risk/High Potential Reward: \\*\\*These are scams. When you don’t have something to lose, you are not investing. you are gambling.\n\n\\*\\*High Risk/Low Potential Reward: \\*\\*Think of it like digging a well, you go deeper and deeper, with all the risk, you finally find out there is a little quantity of groundwater. Worth the risk? Don’t know, maybe now you learned how to dig a well. In the case of cryptocurrencies, I may be a way to experiment.\n\n\\*\\*High risk/high potential reward: \\*\\*Those are the ones you need to investigate and it will take time.\n\nif you are a high-risk/high-reward-looking person, the rest is for you.\n\n## Level 1: All new beginner\n\n***1-Unique value proposition***\n\nIs it clear?

But whenever I visited one of my father’s friends, there always seemed to be some tennis on his TV. Because of that, my earliest memories of tennis are of Martina, and Chrissy and John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors on a grass court in all white. When I got older and my family moved and had access to tennis on the TV, we watched it more often. We followed Pete Sampras, and Steffi Graf, and Monica Seles. We cheered and cried for Zina Garrison and Malivai Washington. However, my real connection to tennis didn’t happen until much later, in 1997.\n\nThat year, I started hearing about a young tennis player, Venus Williams. She had made it all the way to the US Open Finals as an unseeded player and was beaten by the number 1 player, Martina Hingis! But because of the anomaly of her race and upbringing (a Black girl from Compton playing tennis), we were learning more about her and her family, and especially her father. Any black person remotely interested in tennis always became more keenly interested when someone who looked like them made it on TV.\n\nOf course, the players were saddled with the extra weight of representing the hopes and dreams of all the Black people in America whenever they stepped on the court. But we watched with a cautious optimism, seldom prepared for the feelings that came when the player lost. But this felt different. Venus was young, and seemed to be capable of dominating, not just doing well, despite the pressure. And then when we learned that she had a sister who was coming up right behind her, the hope grew stronger. I was determined to see her play in real life.\n\nAs a kid in Miami, I had never had either the occasion or the budget to go to the Key Biscayne tennis tournament. But now, all of a sudden, I wanted to find a way. My college spring break was later than most colleges, and my spring breaks at home in Miami coincided with the massive annual tennis tournament in Key Biscayne — the Lipton, now the Miami Open. For me, it may as well have been the US Open or any Grand Slam because it was my dream opportunity to see Venus in action.\n\nI tried to go when I could, but, without the budget for tickets, it was difficult. One time a friend of my parents got an office ticket for a seat in the 400 level near the sky and gave it to me. I took every other opportunity I got, but they were rare. A friend of mine told me he was signing up to be a volunteer and I should do that too. It would be hard work and many hours. But you would get to see some tennis. Without a sure way of making it to and from Key Biscayne, I didn’t believe I could make the commitment. So I told him I would prefer to be the recipient of the occasional free ticket he would get when he volunteered.\n\nBut there was one day I remember. It was the day of the women’s semifinals and Venus would be playing Martina Hingis again, but I had no ticket. It was such a huge deal that I decided to just show up at Crandon Park and see what would happen. Since I had been there a couple of times, I was familiar with the location of the player and media entrance gate. That’s where college age me and a bunch of little kids would gather all day hoping to get a glimpse of a star. If you were lucky, you could get an autograph on a piece of paper or on an oversized tennis ball. This was before smart phones, so no selfies. But if you had a camera, you could wait for hours trying to get a picture *of a player*, almost never a picture *with a player* unless your parents were with you to take it and you had film left on the camera.\n\nSo when I got to the stadium that day, I figured out how to walk around to the left of the main entrance to find the player entrance. I was just going to take a look. Maybe I would see someone from the Williams family and wave or maybe I would get nowhere and just go back home. But somehow, moments later, I had gotten as far as the valet section of the player entrance. No one said anything, and I kept walking. And all of a sudden, I was in the stadium with no ticket and no plan. Somehow the buzz of arrivals or maybe absent-minded staff and pre 9/11 lax security had all conspired to help me out. I had no ticket, so I wouldn’t be able to get into center court to watch. But at this point, I didn’t care. I just wanted to hang out until I saw the Williams’.\n\nAnd I did. I only remember that Venus drove herself. I believe it was a Toyota 4runner. Smiling and happy, she was too far away or too quick, or I was in shock, but I said nothing, didn’t call out to her, didn’t try to get an autograph. But that’s not why I am telling this story.\n\nAt some point after Venus had already gone in, I looked up and saw an imposing man. A tall black man. At this tournament, there weren’t many black people other than the ground staff or food service workers, and some volunteers, and maybe a handful of older people in tennis gear who played together at some local court. You could spend a day at a tennis tournament and not see more than a couple of other black people. So, although I noticed Coach Williams, the more significant thing was that he noticed me.\n\nHe smiled and acknowledged me. I somehow did not freeze and I said something back… maybe, “Hi Mr. Williams, how are you? I am so excited to see Venus.” I don’t remember. But whatever I said caused him to stop walking. He came over to me, a toothpick in his mouth, really short shorts and a windbreaker. I introduced myself. He asked me what I was doing there. I told him I was home from college and came to see Venus play. We exchanged a few more words and then at some point he realized he had to go. But instead of saying good-bye, he said, “Come on.”\n\n![Coach Richard Williams, with a toothpick in his mouth, watching Venus defeat Martina Hingis from a lower level seat at the Lipton Tournament in Key Biscayne, Miami](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lMPFg8wAeYreCtcu-TKxE.jpg?height=277&width=410)\n\nI remember the voice, the accent, the tone — firm, and urgent, but welcoming. All of a sudden, Richard Williams and I were walking together at a tennis tournament! He was headed into the player area, so as we approached the door, I was ready to say goodbye and thanks for the short chat. But he wasn’t done with me. The security asked for credentials. He showed his, and then told the lady, “he’s with me.” In the same breath, he turns to me and says, “Come on.” I will never know if the security was planning to ask again or stop me from going in, or if she called for backup, because Coach Williams and I just kept walking and I kept my head straight ahead as the door closed behind us.\n\nOur conversation was not about tennis. All he cared about was that I was this little Black kid that was a student at Harvard. He didn’t know me an hour before, but he was proud of me. He talked about his daughters’ interests outside of tennis. He mentioned fashion design. He gushed about how ambitious his children were and how sure he was that they would succeed as business people! In fact, later on, when we got to the room with the rest of the family, he introduced me to Oracene Price, and to Serena, as a Harvard student who could maybe help with tutoring of Venus and Serena!\n\nA side note: I only have two memories of my interactions with Serena that day. One was her saying in response to my questions to her and her mom, who seemed to actually consider the idea of me tutoring her daughters, that she was interested in fashion design. The second was me very timidly pointing to my yellow and black kodak disposable camera, during a changeover while we were in the stands watching her sister play, asking her with my eyes if she would take a picture with me. She said no… but I understood, her sister was in the middle of a match against the world no. 1!\n\nBack to Coach Richard… The only thing he said to me about tennis was that Venus was going to be number 1 and that her sister Serena was really good as well and was going to be a superstar. Venus was the one who I had been watching from the year before and she was the one playing in the tournament. But he spoke of the Serena dominance that was to come with such conviction that when I look back, the only thing I can assume is that he could predict the future.\n\nI was instantly in awe of this man. I was proud to have met him and I was more excited than ever to take a permanent seat on the Williams Sisters’ supporter train. If he turned out to be right, it would be the most high impact change to the sport of tennis that anyone could imagine in 1998, despite many things weighing against the Williams family. You have to remember that there were few reporters, or tennis experts, or people for that matter, who would ever discuss Richard Williams in a positive way. And, even worse, many of the people who were willing to praise Venus and Serena still found it necessary to always add “and they speak well too.”\n\nAs a Black person in America, both the active and the passive racism around the Williams and their story hurt me deeply. Yet, the Williams family kept it moving. These two Williams sisters thrived on and off the court and their earliest coaches, Richard and Oracene, stood firm in the face of challenge after challenge.\n\nIt is why, for the past 23 years, whenever I am in the stands any where in the world, or watching from home I cheer loudly for Venus and Serena, but I also cheer in my heart for Coach Williams. His and Oracene Price’s hard work helped to give us many years of enjoyment and triumphs (and anxiety) from Venus and Serena. By extension, their genius and dedication helped to get us Sloane and Madison and Naomi, and Coco and many other players who looked up to the amazing and awe inspiring Williams sisters growing up.\n\nCoach Williams succeeded in his stated mission many years ago. In fact, as early as 2002, both Venus and Serena were so good that they each held the no. 1 ranking at different times! Yet, it has taken a long 19 years and many championships and Gold Medals to make it clear to a lot of people (including many of the Americans who caught my eye rolls during matches when they rooted for their opponents) that Coach Williams saw a future that he desired for his daughters and did everything in his power to support them as they made it so.\n\nAs I grew older, and as the Williams family’s legendary status got stronger, I lost touch with Coach Williams. Eventually, I was no longer running into Coach at tennis tournaments and never had a third or fourth chance to be seated in the Williams’ player box.\n\n![My ticket from the player’s box seats for a match in the 1998 US Open](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_s_nnmFXMgTXJ-ZDZ2Imh.jpg?height=332&width=679)\n\nBut, I have had many opportunities to watch Venus and Serena build their legacy over the years. They have been a constant source of inspiration and amazing reminders that hard work is the minimum requirement for success. Success in life puts you in the spotlight and you must rise to the occasion, knowing that your actions, and your words, can inspire others to perform. These are philosophies that have guided me and I have Coach Williams to thank for some of that.\n\nMy family and friends who knew about that day in Key Biscayne thought the highlight of my day was being in the Williams’ player box for the match when Venus toppled Martina Hingis. They all thought it was cool that my face popped up on their TV screen multiple times during the match. Many were curious why I was wearing an MIT shirt instead of a Harvard one. And, when people see the video now, they think it awesome that I was sitting with a young Serena cheering on Venus back in 1998.\n\nThe reality, however, is my thoughts during that match were not only on my shirt, or on the match and Venus but also on Coach Williams. Rather than sit in the player box, he sat courtside to get a better look and to shout his support. But I was sitting with Serena and Ms. Price and other important people, like Linda Long, from Puma who had just signed Serena to a contract. But in between the ups and downs of a 2 set to 1 win, my mind often wandered as I thought about the man who put me in that seat. I was grateful for his attention to me that day, and the attention to his goals over the years that played a major part in his daughter’s journey to that stadium. She was laying the foundation for a special legacy that she and her sister were about to build.\n\n![Screen grab from TV footage of Venus’ victory over Martina Hingis in Miami.

(And even if I do, I have digitized the VHS tape that my parents made of the match and the news report on CNN about Venus’ victory). But here’s what I learned from my interactions with Coach Richard:\n\nWe are supposed to do well. It is the price we pay to be here. On that day and whenever we spoke after that at other tournaments or on the occasional short phone call (was often difficult to hear him — “Mark! Hey young man. I’m in a convertible. It’s windy.”) he always focused on performance. How was I doing in school? He was making sure I didn’t let myself or my family down. He spoke in the same way about his children. Keep your head up and show them that you know your worth.\n\nCoach Williams understood the challenges. But he also figured out how to deal with them: Some people would always view you through a different, unsupportive lens. However, we have a responsibility to our families and to our communities to represent the best of us. Most importantly, working hard, consistently, increases the probability that you will win.\n\nThis philosophy that he shared with me just by the way he spoke to me, with the questions he asked, and the responses and advice he gave, was clearly a part of his plan to become the coach of two number 1 ranked, Grand Slam tournament winners. Thank goodness Venus and Serena were such talented and intelligent players that they outperformed even his wildest expectations. But I also stand in constant awe of Coach Williams’ ability to devise such a plan in the first place.\n\nMaybe it is true that Coach Williams predicted the future. But, what I have learned from his family over the years is that predicting the future wasn’t about seeing the future as an out of body experience, existing separately from you and your actions, fated to occur through some magic. It is more of a calculated guess at the future that is likely to happen if you assess your opportunity, your talent, and your resources and then you carefully define the inevitable end result of optimizing these things. Then, you march towards that result — through, over and around obstacles — buoyed by the confidence that no matter what others say, you have what it takes to get to your destination. Thank you, Coach Williams and Coach Price for what you have done. And thank you Venus and Serena for raising the bar.", "timestamp": 1633469585, "digest": "0L_ZG8JYN4yCeUZUPjy-jUQiFMpV5My_COPRETNggoY", "contributor": "0x33398E0a3e38f4e8ed57d5aa56bBc6241cFc8Ec3"}

But whenever I visited one of my father’s friends, there always seemed to be some tennis on his TV. Because of that, my earliest memories of tennis are of Martina, and Chrissy and John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors on a grass court in all white. When I got older and my family moved and had access to tennis on the TV, we watched it more often. We followed Pete Sampras, and Steffi Graf, and Monica Seles. We cheered and cried for Zina Garrison and Malivai Washington. However, my real connection to tennis didn’t happen until much later, in 1997.\n\nThat year, I started hearing about a young tennis player, Venus Williams. She had made it all the way to the US Open Finals as an unseeded player and was beaten by the number 1 player, Martina Hingis!

I guess while I’m here I should briefly introduce myself before diving in… \n\n## Hi, I’m Pablo\n\nI want to make the world a better place. I think technology (specifically web3 technology) is the biggest lever I can pull that will help everyday people. \\n  \\n So what am I working on?\n\n## I’m working on Junto: A web3 distributed library\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pWQiyB3vFLJRHyxa0fgCa.gif?height=620&width=621)\n\nJunto’s mission is to help shift our world’s economy from a scarcity model to an abundance model. \\n  \\n We’re tackling this problem by reviving the idea of a distributed library in the web3 era.\n\n## What is a distributed library?\n\nA distributed library is like a normal (centralized) library, but instead the users still own the items. There’s no central storage, or central entity that manages the items. It’s all peer-to-peer. It’s not just for books, but for anything!  \\n  \\n A library could be made for anything that sits around with little use: Spare rooms, extra cars, vacation homes, books, climbing gear, music equipment, rarely-used expensive kitchen ware… the list goes on\n\n## Why does web3 make this different?\n\nWe’ve always been able to lend our things out to people, but it rarely happens. It seems like a hassle. Things break. Logistics can be annoying. People are busy. People forget to return the items.\n\nYes, the world would be a better place if everyone shared their stuff, but you have to either really trust the other person you lend to, or set up a complicated legal agreement for collateral and insurance (like a time-share). Then what? Will I sue them if they break it?\n\n**Enter web3**\n\nFor the first time ever with web3 we’re seeing powers that traditionally only a company or government could wield (with an army of expensive lawyers) that are now in the hands of the everyday person or community.\n\nWe can easily make **self-enforced** smart contracts. No legal fees (likely some gas, though). Just connect a wallet and get moving.\n\nWeb3 allows for people to easily make money on the internet through community network effects. \\n  \\n Web3 also lets you incorporate a DAO for each community that can allow people to trade using their own complementary currency, and then as more people join, the library’s value goes up. \\n  \\n You can tokenize your items and sell them on-chain, or **just upload your items to Junto and let them make money for you while you sleep.**\n\n## Ok… but you still have to trust people to not break your things? How is trust solved?\n\nSmart contracts are a huge key here. Namely, incentive alignment between people using mutually assured destruction.\n\nLet me introduce the **Junto contract** and explain how it works (I promise it won’t be painful, 3 minutes max of thinking). This really is the core technology that enables all of this to work.\n\nSo let’s imagine Lisa wants to lend Bob her $10 item.\n\nWhat if Lisa could send Bob a smart contract that asks Bob to deposit $15 in the contract?\n\nThis means that Bob would never be incentivized to steal the item, because he would lose more than the item is worth.\n\n![Please pardon my crappy drawings](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yTlF7w7ZwGfakLChDgBUc.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nLisa doesn’t have to trust Bob at all, because she can always take the $15.\n\nThis solves a lot of issues already. Even this vanilla contract would be extremely helpful for making these transactions happen. If you look closely there’s a problem here though! Bob has to trust Lisa. Lisa could steal the $15 from Bob.\n\nTo protect Bob we can prevent Lisa from stealing the money in the contract herself. \n\nInstead she can just “nuke” the contract and forward the value inside of it to an agreed upon address (e.g. a charity both Lisa and Bob support).\n\n![Lisa's got a nuke... (to the tune of Janie's got a gun)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pmi-CpHOI8zK62sezXcSY.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nThis is a little better. Now Lisa can’t steal the money in the contract herself. She’s not incentivized to destroy the contract, but if Bob were to steal the item, then she can nuke the contract.\n\nThere’s still a problem here though: Bob could be blackmailed by Lisa for the $5 (she’s very petty). So to balance the equation Lisa can put in what we call a “goodwill collateral”\n\nThis is collateral that Lisa puts into the contract to say “Hey, I have something at stake inside of the contract too. I want to get my money out as well. I have no incentive to blackmail you.” \\n  \\n So, here we have the final contract state!\n\n![Both the lender and borrower are aligned through the incentives created by the contract](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cp057tJSqVhyqRKS7q66w.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nBoth people in the contract can at any point “nuke” the contract and nullify it, but both are strongly incentivized to get their money out of the contract and work together.\n\nIt’s important to note as well that each of the fields in the contract are **totally open for customization**. You can make the “Agreed upon 3rd party” the lender. Or you can change the collateral amounts based on trust levels. If you feel like there’s an asymmetry of risk, you can up the collateral on either side of the contract before signing. It’s all in your hands. \n\nAlso: **you can include a payment before or after the transaction ends**. \n\nSo you can charge someone for using your surfboard, books, recreational equipment, spare room, car, etc., and sleep easy at night knowing that the contract protects you.\n\n(NB: I invite anyone to try to crack the game theory of this contract! Many have tried…)\n\n## Ok, so I just upload my items to an app and they make money for me? I don’t have to trust anyone?\n\nBasically yes!

You own them, can remove them from the app whenever, or modify the contract for any of the items. \n\n## What would a world where people use this look like?\n\nRight now we are incredibly dependent on global supply chains and huge companies.

There’s no central storage, or central entity that manages the items. It’s all peer-to-peer. It’s not just for books, but for anything!  \\n  \\n A library could be made for anything that sits around with little use: Spare rooms, extra cars, vacation homes, books, climbing gear, music equipment, rarely-used expensive kitchen ware… the list goes on\n\n## Why does web3 make this different?\n\nWe’ve always been able to lend our things out to people, but it rarely happens. It seems like a hassle. Things break. Logistics can be annoying. People are busy. People forget to return the items.\n\nYes, the world would be a better place if everyone shared their stuff, but you have to either really trust the other person you lend to, or set up a complicated legal agreement for collateral and insurance (like a time-share). Then what? Will I sue them if they break it?\n\n**Enter web3**\n\nFor the first time ever with web3 we’re seeing powers that traditionally only a company or government could wield (with an army of expensive lawyers) that are now in the hands of the everyday person or community.\n\nWe can easily make **self-enforced** smart contracts.

I guess while I’m here I should briefly introduce myself before diving in… \n\n## Hi, I’m Pablo\n\nI want to make the world a better place. I think technology (specifically web3 technology) is the biggest lever I can pull that will help everyday people. \\n  \\n So what am I working on?\n\n## I’m working on Junto: A web3 distributed library\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pWQiyB3vFLJRHyxa0fgCa.gif?height=620&width=621)\n\nJunto’s mission is to help shift our world’s economy from a scarcity model to an abundance model. \\n  \\n We’re tackling this problem by reviving the idea of a distributed library in the web3 era.\n\n## What is a distributed library?\n\nA distributed library is like a normal (centralized) library, but instead the users still own the items. There’s no central storage, or central entity that manages the items. It’s all peer-to-peer. It’s not just for books, but for anything!  \\n  \\n A library could be made for anything that sits around with little use: Spare rooms, extra cars, vacation homes, books, climbing gear, music equipment, rarely-used expensive kitchen ware… the list goes on\n\n## Why does web3 make this different?\n\nWe’ve always been able to lend our things out to people, but it rarely happens. It seems like a hassle. Things break. Logistics can be annoying. People are busy. People forget to return the items.\n\nYes, the world would be a better place if everyone shared their stuff, but you have to either really trust the other person you lend to, or set up a complicated legal agreement for collateral and insurance (like a time-share). Then what? Will I sue them if they break it?\n\n**Enter web3**\n\nFor the first time ever with web3 we’re seeing powers that traditionally only a company or government could wield (with an army of expensive lawyers) that are now in the hands of the everyday person or community.\n\nWe can easily make **self-enforced** smart contracts. No legal fees (likely some gas, though). Just connect a wallet and get moving.\n\nWeb3 allows for people to easily make money on the internet through community network effects. \\n  \\n Web3 also lets you incorporate a DAO for each community that can allow people to trade using their own complementary currency, and then as more people join, the library’s value goes up. \\n  \\n You can tokenize your items and sell them on-chain, or **just upload your items to Junto and let them make money for you while you sleep.**\n\n## Ok… but you still have to trust people to not break your things? How is trust solved?\n\nSmart contracts are a huge key here. Namely, incentive alignment between people using mutually assured destruction.\n\nLet me introduce the **Junto contract** and explain how it works (I promise it won’t be painful, 3 minutes max of thinking). This really is the core technology that enables all of this to work.\n\nSo let’s imagine Lisa wants to lend Bob her $10 item.\n\nWhat if Lisa could send Bob a smart contract that asks Bob to deposit $15 in the contract?\n\nThis means that Bob would never be incentivized to steal the item, because he would lose more than the item is worth.\n\n![Please pardon my crappy drawings](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yTlF7w7ZwGfakLChDgBUc.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nLisa doesn’t have to trust Bob at all, because she can always take the $15.\n\nThis solves a lot of issues already. Even this vanilla contract would be extremely helpful for making these transactions happen. If you look closely there’s a problem here though! Bob has to trust Lisa. Lisa could steal the $15 from Bob.\n\nTo protect Bob we can prevent Lisa from stealing the money in the contract herself. \n\nInstead she can just “nuke” the contract and forward the value inside of it to an agreed upon address (e.g. a charity both Lisa and Bob support).\n\n![Lisa's got a nuke... (to the tune of Janie's got a gun)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pmi-CpHOI8zK62sezXcSY.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nThis is a little better. Now Lisa can’t steal the money in the contract herself. She’s not incentivized to destroy the contract, but if Bob were to steal the item, then she can nuke the contract.\n\nThere’s still a problem here though: Bob could be blackmailed by Lisa for the $5 (she’s very petty). So to balance the equation Lisa can put in what we call a “goodwill collateral”\n\nThis is collateral that Lisa puts into the contract to say “Hey, I have something at stake inside of the contract too. I want to get my money out as well. I have no incentive to blackmail you.” \\n  \\n So, here we have the final contract state!\n\n![Both the lender and borrower are aligned through the incentives created by the contract](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cp057tJSqVhyqRKS7q66w.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nBoth people in the contract can at any point “nuke” the contract and nullify it, but both are strongly incentivized to get their money out of the contract and work together.\n\nIt’s important to note as well that each of the fields in the contract are **totally open for customization**. You can make the “Agreed upon 3rd party” the lender. Or you can change the collateral amounts based on trust levels. If you feel like there’s an asymmetry of risk, you can up the collateral on either side of the contract before signing. It’s all in your hands. \n\nAlso: **you can include a payment before or after the transaction ends**. \n\nSo you can charge someone for using your surfboard, books, recreational equipment, spare room, car, etc., and sleep easy at night knowing that the contract protects you.\n\n(NB: I invite anyone to try to crack the game theory of this contract! Many have tried…)\n\n## Ok, so I just upload my items to an app and they make money for me? I don’t have to trust anyone?\n\nBasically yes! Our app is trying to decentralize the core functionality (peer-to-peer transactions) and then become progressively decentralized over time so there is no middle man. \\n  \\n You’re still in control of your items. You own them, can remove them from the app whenever, or modify the contract for any of the items. \n\n## What would a world where people use this look like?\n\nRight now we are incredibly dependent on global supply chains and huge companies. This is not only extremely fragile as a system, but also this centralization can lead to authoritarianism from large powerful organizations. Stick it to the man by sharing your items.\n\nOur sense of community used to come from our economic relations -- tight knit communities where each would help bring something to the table.

{"id": "fPSZ5hOyFk21kZolXiLDhtEcigdk1O35e_lAXGjG6qw", "title": "King Richard Williams — How Alexis Ohanian’s Father in Law and Serena William’s dad got me past security.", "body": "I didn’t have cable TV as a child, so I rarely saw tennis on our TV at home. But whenever I visited one of my father’s friends, there always seemed to be some tennis on his TV. Because of that, my earliest memories of tennis are of Martina, and Chrissy and John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors on a grass court in all white. When I got older and my family moved and had access to tennis on the TV, we watched it more often. We followed Pete Sampras, and Steffi Graf, and Monica Seles. We cheered and cried for Zina Garrison and Malivai Washington. However, my real connection to tennis didn’t happen until much later, in 1997.\n\nThat year, I started hearing about a young tennis player, Venus Williams. She had made it all the way to the US Open Finals as an unseeded player and was beaten by the number 1 player, Martina Hingis! But because of the anomaly of her race and upbringing (a Black girl from Compton playing tennis), we were learning more about her and her family, and especially her father. Any black person remotely interested in tennis always became more keenly interested when someone who looked like them made it on TV.\n\nOf course, the players were saddled with the extra weight of representing the hopes and dreams of all the Black people in America whenever they stepped on the court. But we watched with a cautious optimism, seldom prepared for the feelings that came when the player lost. But this felt different. Venus was young, and seemed to be capable of dominating, not just doing well, despite the pressure. And then when we learned that she had a sister who was coming up right behind her, the hope grew stronger. I was determined to see her play in real life.\n\nAs a kid in Miami, I had never had either the occasion or the budget to go to the Key Biscayne tennis tournament. But now, all of a sudden, I wanted to find a way. My college spring break was later than most colleges, and my spring breaks at home in Miami coincided with the massive annual tennis tournament in Key Biscayne — the Lipton, now the Miami Open. For me, it may as well have been the US Open or any Grand Slam because it was my dream opportunity to see Venus in action.\n\nI tried to go when I could, but, without the budget for tickets, it was difficult. One time a friend of my parents got an office ticket for a seat in the 400 level near the sky and gave it to me. I took every other opportunity I got, but they were rare. A friend of mine told me he was signing up to be a volunteer and I should do that too. It would be hard work and many hours. But you would get to see some tennis. Without a sure way of making it to and from Key Biscayne, I didn’t believe I could make the commitment. So I told him I would prefer to be the recipient of the occasional free ticket he would get when he volunteered.\n\nBut there was one day I remember. It was the day of the women’s semifinals and Venus would be playing Martina Hingis again, but I had no ticket. It was such a huge deal that I decided to just show up at Crandon Park and see what would happen. Since I had been there a couple of times, I was familiar with the location of the player and media entrance gate. That’s where college age me and a bunch of little kids would gather all day hoping to get a glimpse of a star. If you were lucky, you could get an autograph on a piece of paper or on an oversized tennis ball. This was before smart phones, so no selfies. But if you had a camera, you could wait for hours trying to get a picture *of a player*, almost never a picture *with a player* unless your parents were with you to take it and you had film left on the camera.\n\nSo when I got to the stadium that day, I figured out how to walk around to the left of the main entrance to find the player entrance. I was just going to take a look. Maybe I would see someone from the Williams family and wave or maybe I would get nowhere and just go back home. But somehow, moments later, I had gotten as far as the valet section of the player entrance. No one said anything, and I kept walking. And all of a sudden, I was in the stadium with no ticket and no plan. Somehow the buzz of arrivals or maybe absent-minded staff and pre 9/11 lax security had all conspired to help me out. I had no ticket, so I wouldn’t be able to get into center court to watch. But at this point, I didn’t care. I just wanted to hang out until I saw the Williams’.\n\nAnd I did. I only remember that Venus drove herself. I believe it was a Toyota 4runner. Smiling and happy, she was too far away or too quick, or I was in shock, but I said nothing, didn’t call out to her, didn’t try to get an autograph. But that’s not why I am telling this story.\n\nAt some point after Venus had already gone in, I looked up and saw an imposing man. A tall black man. At this tournament, there weren’t many black people other than the ground staff or food service workers, and some volunteers, and maybe a handful of older people in tennis gear who played together at some local court. You could spend a day at a tennis tournament and not see more than a couple of other black people. So, although I noticed Coach Williams, the more significant thing was that he noticed me.\n\nHe smiled and acknowledged me. I somehow did not freeze and I said something back… maybe, “Hi Mr. Williams, how are you? I am so excited to see Venus.” I don’t remember. But whatever I said caused him to stop walking. He came over to me, a toothpick in his mouth, really short shorts and a windbreaker. I introduced myself. He asked me what I was doing there. I told him I was home from college and came to see Venus play. We exchanged a few more words and then at some point he realized he had to go. But instead of saying good-bye, he said, “Come on.”\n\n![Coach Richard Williams, with a toothpick in his mouth, watching Venus defeat Martina Hingis from a lower level seat at the Lipton Tournament in Key Biscayne, Miami](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lMPFg8wAeYreCtcu-TKxE.jpg?height=277&width=410)\n\nI remember the voice, the accent, the tone — firm, and urgent, but welcoming. All of a sudden, Richard Williams and I were walking together at a tennis tournament! He was headed into the player area, so as we approached the door, I was ready to say goodbye and thanks for the short chat. But he wasn’t done with me. The security asked for credentials. He showed his, and then told the lady, “he’s with me.” In the same breath, he turns to me and says, “Come on.” I will never know if the security was planning to ask again or stop me from going in, or if she called for backup, because Coach Williams and I just kept walking and I kept my head straight ahead as the door closed behind us.\n\nOur conversation was not about tennis. All he cared about was that I was this little Black kid that was a student at Harvard. He didn’t know me an hour before, but he was proud of me. He talked about his daughters’ interests outside of tennis. He mentioned fashion design. He gushed about how ambitious his children were and how sure he was that they would succeed as business people! In fact, later on, when we got to the room with the rest of the family, he introduced me to Oracene Price, and to Serena, as a Harvard student who could maybe help with tutoring of Venus and Serena!\n\nA side note: I only have two memories of my interactions with Serena that day. One was her saying in response to my questions to her and her mom, who seemed to actually consider the idea of me tutoring her daughters, that she was interested in fashion design. The second was me very timidly pointing to my yellow and black kodak disposable camera, during a changeover while we were in the stands watching her sister play, asking her with my eyes if she would take a picture with me. She said no… but I understood, her sister was in the middle of a match against the world no. 1!\n\nBack to Coach Richard… The only thing he said to me about tennis was that Venus was going to be number 1 and that her sister Serena was really good as well and was going to be a superstar. Venus was the one who I had been watching from the year before and she was the one playing in the tournament. But he spoke of the Serena dominance that was to come with such conviction that when I look back, the only thing I can assume is that he could predict the future.\n\nI was instantly in awe of this man. I was proud to have met him and I was more excited than ever to take a permanent seat on the Williams Sisters’ supporter train. If he turned out to be right, it would be the most high impact change to the sport of tennis that anyone could imagine in 1998, despite many things weighing against the Williams family. You have to remember that there were few reporters, or tennis experts, or people for that matter, who would ever discuss Richard Williams in a positive way. And, even worse, many of the people who were willing to praise Venus and Serena still found it necessary to always add “and they speak well too.”\n\nAs a Black person in America, both the active and the passive racism around the Williams and their story hurt me deeply. Yet, the Williams family kept it moving. These two Williams sisters thrived on and off the court and their earliest coaches, Richard and Oracene, stood firm in the face of challenge after challenge.\n\nIt is why, for the past 23 years, whenever I am in the stands any where in the world, or watching from home I cheer loudly for Venus and Serena, but I also cheer in my heart for Coach Williams. His and Oracene Price’s hard work helped to give us many years of enjoyment and triumphs (and anxiety) from Venus and Serena. By extension, their genius and dedication helped to get us Sloane and Madison and Naomi, and Coco and many other players who looked up to the amazing and awe inspiring Williams sisters growing up.\n\nCoach Williams succeeded in his stated mission many years ago. In fact, as early as 2002, both Venus and Serena were so good that they each held the no. 1 ranking at different times! Yet, it has taken a long 19 years and many championships and Gold Medals to make it clear to a lot of people (including many of the Americans who caught my eye rolls during matches when they rooted for their opponents) that Coach Williams saw a future that he desired for his daughters and did everything in his power to support them as they made it so.\n\nAs I grew older, and as the Williams family’s legendary status got stronger, I lost touch with Coach Williams. Eventually, I was no longer running into Coach at tennis tournaments and never had a third or fourth chance to be seated in the Williams’ player box.\n\n![My ticket from the player’s box seats for a match in the 1998 US Open](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_s_nnmFXMgTXJ-ZDZ2Imh.jpg?height=332&width=679)\n\nBut, I have had many opportunities to watch Venus and Serena build their legacy over the years. They have been a constant source of inspiration and amazing reminders that hard work is the minimum requirement for success. Success in life puts you in the spotlight and you must rise to the occasion, knowing that your actions, and your words, can inspire others to perform. These are philosophies that have guided me and I have Coach Williams to thank for some of that.\n\nMy family and friends who knew about that day in Key Biscayne thought the highlight of my day was being in the Williams’ player box for the match when Venus toppled Martina Hingis. They all thought it was cool that my face popped up on their TV screen multiple times during the match. Many were curious why I was wearing an MIT shirt instead of a Harvard one. And, when people see the video now, they think it awesome that I was sitting with a young Serena cheering on Venus back in 1998.\n\nThe reality, however, is my thoughts during that match were not only on my shirt, or on the match and Venus but also on Coach Williams. Rather than sit in the player box, he sat courtside to get a better look and to shout his support. But I was sitting with Serena and Ms. Price and other important people, like Linda Long, from Puma who had just signed Serena to a contract. But in between the ups and downs of a 2 set to 1 win, my mind often wandered as I thought about the man who put me in that seat. I was grateful for his attention to me that day, and the attention to his goals over the years that played a major part in his daughter’s journey to that stadium. She was laying the foundation for a special legacy that she and her sister were about to build.\n\n![Screen grab from TV footage of Venus’ victory over Martina Hingis in Miami. Back Row L-R Mark McIntosh, Oracene Price; Front Row L-R Serena Williams and Lyndrea Price](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_MK5_18quCtKeFFRr6-YP.jpeg?height=685&width=1042)\n\nI will never forget that day. (And even if I do, I have digitized the VHS tape that my parents made of the match and the news report on CNN about Venus’ victory). But here’s what I learned from my interactions with Coach Richard:\n\nWe are supposed to do well. It is the price we pay to be here. On that day and whenever we spoke after that at other tournaments or on the occasional short phone call (was often difficult to hear him — “Mark! Hey young man. I’m in a convertible. It’s windy.”) he always focused on performance. How was I doing in school? He was making sure I didn’t let myself or my family down. He spoke in the same way about his children. Keep your head up and show them that you know your worth.\n\nCoach Williams understood the challenges. But he also figured out how to deal with them: Some people would always view you through a different, unsupportive lens. However, we have a responsibility to our families and to our communities to represent the best of us. Most importantly, working hard, consistently, increases the probability that you will win.\n\nThis philosophy that he shared with me just by the way he spoke to me, with the questions he asked, and the responses and advice he gave, was clearly a part of his plan to become the coach of two number 1 ranked, Grand Slam tournament winners. Thank goodness Venus and Serena were such talented and intelligent players that they outperformed even his wildest expectations. But I also stand in constant awe of Coach Williams’ ability to devise such a plan in the first place.\n\nMaybe it is true that Coach Williams predicted the future. But, what I have learned from his family over the years is that predicting the future wasn’t about seeing the future as an out of body experience, existing separately from you and your actions, fated to occur through some magic. It is more of a calculated guess at the future that is likely to happen if you assess your opportunity, your talent, and your resources and then you carefully define the inevitable end result of optimizing these things. Then, you march towards that result — through, over and around obstacles — buoyed by the confidence that no matter what others say, you have what it takes to get to your destination. Thank you, Coach Williams and Coach Price for what you have done. And thank you Venus and Serena for raising the bar.", "timestamp": 1633470335, "digest": "EZ4mfKnhq-RSdzJ2l4cKF4MQovgU2O1N2Q9dicxunCk", "contributor": "0x33398E0a3e38f4e8ed57d5aa56bBc6241cFc8Ec3"}
{"id": "rAKA7Y3qxXcCi9li0FOM2JT47nkcGbYX9C9t10_G2XI", "title": "Damn Vulnerable DeFi: Naive Receiver ", "body": "*Warning: Solution to the challenge will be discussed here. Also note, I could be totally fucking wrong about everything I’m about to write. This is mostly just me long form “tweeting into the ether” about my smart contract journey. Proceed with caution.*\n\n## Problem\n\n> *There’s a lending pool offering quite expensive flash loans of Ether, which has 1000 ETH in balance.*\n>\n> *You also see that a user has deployed a contract with 10 ETH in balance, capable of interacting with the lending pool and receiveing flash loans of ETH.*\n>\n> *Drain all ETH funds from the user’s contract. Doing it in a single transaction is a big plus ;)*\n\nOkay, so this problem isn’t even asking us to drain the cool expensive flash loan with 1k ETH; it just wants us to see if we can drain a separate contract, attached to an EOA that’s interacting with the flash loan contract.\n\n> NaiveReceiverLenderPool.sol\n\n![An image of the NaiveReceiverLenderPool smart contract](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*g9T7BDJDAzDbsRyx6JxJuA.png)\n\n> Sidenote: The first line of code is omitted here but it specifies the Solidity pragma as version \\*`^0.6.0`\n\nRight off the bat, we notice a few libraries brought in to handle issues like Reentrancy, arithmetic under/over flows, and a library for dealing with different address sources in Ethereum (contracts and EOAs). Cool.\n\nAs we read down the contract, I notice something that kind of gives me an immediate pause because who wants to pay a fee of 1ETH to take out a loan? That’s a pretty wild fee. Not only that but the variable for the fee is defined as both `private` and `constant` , meaning not only will this fee not be (easily) queryable and the value also cannot be changed after it is deployed.\n\n*Note:* `constant` and `immutable` keywords both specify a type of state variable on the Ethereum blockchain. `constant` keywords can’t be changed and must be set at creation while `immutable` can be changed within the constructor at deployment. Also, EVM doesn’t reserve storage for variables that are given these flags and instead just puts their value in place where the variable is called. (Not really sure what this really means yet will update later).\n\n### fixedFee\n\nThis is pretty straightforward, we have an external function that doesn’t do anything but read and return the `FIXED_FEE` `constant`variable that was defined earlier in the contract. Not much to gauge from this.\n\n### flashLoan\n\nThis shit is nonReentrant. Okay so any hopes I had initially of calling flashLoan multiple times to bankrupt the contract might be for naught. This f(x) is going to be called externally and it’s expecting just two arguments that it’ll process — namely, a `payable address` and a `uint256` known respectively as `borrower` and the `borrowAmount` and it does a couple of important checks right out the gate with these two pieces of info.\n\nFirst, we see that the f(x) is checking the current balance of the pool and then verifying that the amount being requested as the `borrowAmount` isn’t more than what’s actually available within the contract. Next, the f(x) is going to do a check on the `borrower` that was provided to ensure that this function is being called by a contract.\n\n> Sidenote: The `isContract`*method relies on* `extcodesize`, which returns 0 for contracts in construction, since the code is only stored at the end of the constructor execution. `EXTCODESIZE` returns 0 if it is called from the constructor of a contract. So if you are using this in a security sensitive setting, you would have to consider if this is a problem. \\*\\*\\**It is unsafe to assume that an address for which this function returns false is an externally-owned account (EOA) and not a contract. Among others,* `isContract` will return `false` for the following types of addresses: \\n — an externally-owned account \\n — a contract in construction \\n — an address where a contract will be created \\n — an address where a contract lived, but was destroyed\n\nAfter all of those checks clear out, the contract attempts to make a call to the `borrower` contract with a `call` that attempts to call a f(x) on the other end by the name of `receiveEther` that accepts a `uint256` as an argument with the `NaiveReceiverLendingPool`passing in its `FIXED_FEE` as the argument.\n\nWe do two final checks for this f(x) where we check if `success` of our external call is true and then we make sure that we were given our refund for the flashLoan at the end which will either succeed and everything is squared away or it fails and all the changes get reverted.\n\nNothing too big jumps out from any of this so far, but I’m very curious to see the f(x) on the other end that’s handling reception of the ETH as well as the payment of the fee.\n\n![Picture of the fallback function within NaiveRecieverLendingPool](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*8Jwx3MXjjVcCaQcktbC-cg.png)\n\n### fallback\n\nThis just looks like a basic fallback function for allowing the contract to accept deposits. No logic is found in the function, so I won’t spend too much time thinking about this one.\n\n> FlashLoanReceiver.sol\n\n![An image of the FlashLoanReceiver smart contract](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2navuXCzW50iSgJXnOD7L.png?height=1408&width=1556)\n\nAh, beautiful. There doesn’t seem to be any sort of guard for reentrancy imported here. Maybe we can use that? We are still using SafeMath and Address but this time we’re specifically using it for `address payable` and then immediately there’s this `address payable private pool` state that doesn’t get an instantiation from jump.\n\n### constructor\n\nHere we have a `public` constructor that is just taking `address payable pool` as its argument and setting `pool` to be an instance of the contract that’s being pointed to with the `poolAddress` variable, in our case the `NaiveReceiverLenderPool`\n\n### receiveEther\n\nThis is what we came for. We have a function that can be called by anyone to send value to this smart contract, and we also attach a `fee` argument here that maps to what we passed in as our `FIXED_FEE` and immediately makes a check to be sure that the address that is sending this call is matching the `pool` instance that was created in the constructor when the contract was deployed. We see that the f(x) creates `amountToBeRepaid` that takes whatever value is sent over for the loan request plus a fee of 1ETH as defined by `FIXED_FEE` , and then we make a quick check to be certain that the amount requested in addition to the `FIXED_FEE` is available in the contract to actually pay back the `NaiveReceiverLenderPool` at the end of this call. Some action is executed and then the money is returned to the lending pool; however, **the issue here is that the** `Receiver` **has absolutely no way to *reject* incoming loans that are called with their address. What this means is that, when we look at** `NaiveReceiverLenderPool` **we can see that the function to call flashLoan is only flagged to be called externally (by anyone) and we can supply an address of our choosing to accept the flashLoan by passing it into** `borrower` **, and in this case we can bankrupt** `Receiver` **entirely by asking for flash loans that are getting hit with a fee.**\n\n### _executeActionDuringFlashLoan\n\nThis is just some general `internal` f(x) that only `Receiver` can call in order to pull off whatever trading insight they believe they’ve reasoned upon. Nothing to see here beyond the confines of your own imagination.\n\n### fallback\n\nA fallback for just depositing money into the contract.\n\n## Solution\n\n![An image of the JS snippet used to verify exploit](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pAgP6SmUzNSyiKTAJrfTd.png?height=252&width=1226)\n\nSo the solution here is to just call `flashLoan` from our wallet, and we don’t even have to specify a loan amount as long as we have a 1 ETH `FIXED_FEE` , so we just drain the contract with 10 calls. I’m going to play around with the draining the contract in 1 transaction; I have a feeling there are a few options.\n\n### Reflection\n\nThis one made me feel bad 😞 I didn’t like draining some random person’s funds that’s cruel, but I did learn quite a bit about securing your contracts and making sure that receiving ether from a contract is always a more explicit flow for the `Receiver` — a few things I’d have done differently:\n\n1. A check within the `flashLoan` f(x) inside of `NaiveReceiverLendingPool`to be sure that `borrower` is `msg.sender` would be one change I’d make here to ensure that we aren’t actually letting random people request loans for others.\n2. We should probably add a check in this current `FlashLoanReceiver` to make sure that the trade was profitable or else we should revert like so `require(savedAmountFromExecuteFlashLoan > amountToBeRepaid + gasLimit)` This way we have the benefit of simply reverting which will cause `success` in `NaiveReceiverLendingPool` to be false which will cause the following `require` clause to fail.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis one was mostly just about considering the effects of withdrawal design and how dangerous it can be to not affirm origins of f(x) calls.", "timestamp": 1633470415, "digest": "eV4ON6xRvJUjR4PrKbl3OA9d7cKUlW9nuuNerfE5t6E", "contributor": "0xA699720418F612558E2827Bf68631686e9d1095e"}

My cousin starts sending me updates about the cryptocurrency markets. I watched videos about bitcoin 2 years ago. I was not really interested in it at that time. What caught my eyes during those updates in how the market fluctuated.\n\nAt that time, bitcoin just passed $25k. I didn’t understand why it keep going up and down. I needed to go deeper. I kept digging. I started watching Youtube videos about financial markets, trading basics, and blockchain/currency explanations. It was eye-opening.\n\nFrom then, I started my journey with cryptocurrencies. I started with $2.\n\nFrom there, my journey was a rollercoaster trip :\n\n* Tesla bought some bitcoin\n* Beeple sold his NFTs for 69 million dollars\n* China cracks down miners in their country\n* Tesla stops accepting bitcoin\n* The market crashed in May 2021\n* El Salvador accepts bitcoin as a legal tender\n\nEvery single one of these events had an effect on the market.\n\nWhat kind of effect?\n\nLemme show you.\n\n## Understand market moves\n\n![Psychology of market cycle from Binance](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*dqswBfaNfUiTgEnL)\n\nI went through all of those phases.\n\nPrices of assets go down and up depending on the market.\n\nA definition of a market is where people meet and exchange value.\n\nFor example :\n\n* in the stock market, people exchange shares with money.\n* in the bond market where participants can issue new [debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt), known as the [primary market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_market), or buy and sell debt [securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)), known as the [secondary market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_market).\n\nAnd now, the crypto market: you buy coins in exchange for fiat.\n\nThe number of people buying coins and the amount of people selling determines the market moves.\n\nYou can analyze the market move using two factors :**Technical analysis**: look at the chart for different indicators of a pattern.\n\n![Typical chart view from tradingview.com](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*cv5HQb6Cs3pVe2ua.png)\n\n**Fundamental analysis**: looks at the bigger picture, regulation, market cap, other news, or issues around a specific market. This methodology looks at the BTC value for example, as a technology regardless of the current price and its outside prices in order to determine what will happen.\n\nWith the understanding of these two basics analysis of market moves, lemme explain the market conditions.\n\n**Bull market :**\n\n![The psychological effect of a bull market](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*z1G_i7F-Q52Lca6tDdnrFA.png)\n\nA [bull market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp) is a market that is on the rise and where the conditions of the economy are generally favorable.\n\nA bull market is typified by a sustained increase in prices. In the case of equity markets, a bull market denotes a rise in the prices of companies’ shares. In such times, investors often have faith that the [uptrend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptrend.asp) will continue over the long term. In this scenario, the country’s economy is typically strong and employment levels are high.\n\nIn the case of the crypto market, it means the price per coin (in $) is going up.\n\n**Bear market :**\n\n![The psychological effect of a bear market](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*2XvHswIwpRSPX902IWdwMg.png)\n\nA bear market exists in an economy that is receding and where most stocks are declining in value.\n\nA [bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp) is one that is in decline. A market is usually not considered a true “bear” market unless it has fallen 20% or more from recent highs. In a bear market, share prices are continuously dropping. This results in a downward trend that investors believe will continue; this belief, in turn, perpetuates the downward spiral. During a bear market, the economy slows down and unemployment rises as companies begin laying off workers.\n\nin the case of the crypto market, the price per coin is going down.\n\nBecause the financial markets are greatly influenced by investors’ attitudes, these terms also denote how investors feel about the market and the ensuing economic trends :\n\n> You are bullish if you believe that an asset will increase in price;\n>\n> You are bearish otherwise.\n\nNow you understand the basics of market moves, let’s jump into the cryptocurrency market.\n\n## Cryptocurrency as an investment\n\nInvesting is different from trading.\n\n> Trading means you are for the short term market move. You take profit as soon as the market move the way you predict it. If you open a position saying the trend is going up (meaning you are taking a long position), once it does, you take profit. If not, you lose. If you open a position saying the trend is going down (meaning you are taking the short position), once it does, you take your profit. If not you lose\n\nLike I said in [my recent article](https://medium.com/coinmonks/beginner-guide-for-first-time-nfts-buyers-2021-7abecb8dd059), Bitcoin was created in the context of an economic crisis. Satoshi Nakamoto quotes :\n\n***The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible*.**\n\nThis was the beginning of a long road.\n\nIn 2008, an anonymous person called Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin. It’s money on the Internet, without banks, without a middle man.\n\n**First, what is money?**\n\nMoney is often defined in terms of the three **functions** or **services** that it provides :\n\n* **Medium of exchange**: Money’s most important function is as a medium of exchange to ease transactions. Without money, all transactions would have to be conducted by **barter.** It involves the direct exchange of one good or service for another.\n* **Store of value:** To be a medium of exchange, money must hold its value over time; that is, it must be a store of value. Otherwise, money could not be stored for some period and remain valuable in exchange.\n* **Unit of account**: Money also functions as a unit of account, providing a *common measure of the value* of goods and services being exchanged.\n\nHow did Satoshi manage to create “Internet money” with these functions?\n\nHe leveraged something called **Blockchain**.\n\nBlockchain is a register where every transaction is recorded. Its characteristics :\n\n* **Immutability**: No possibility to make a change on the register once data is in the ledger.\n* **Decentralized**: No one owns the technology, it’s shared among the users.\n* **Anonymity**: You don’t need to give your credentials, a random password is given to you only.\n* **Security**: It’s almost impossible to hack because of the density of the network.\n\nWith it, Satoshi made Bitcoin. No possibility to double spend. A store of value. A medium of exchange. A unit of account. All combined using blockchain and cryptography.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin has exploded. After 13 years, a unit of bitcoin is now worth between $30k and $65k depending on the demand.\n\nIn 2015, a group of 8 persons figured out they can do more things with the blockchain: ***they can build some kind of contract on top of it***.\n\nGiven the fact that the blockchain is a register, what you put on it depends on the writer of the code. If they can figure out a way to codify functions and put it on the blockchain, they will have another use case.\n\n> And they made it. Ethereum was born.\n\nYou can create your coin(or token) like Bitcoin, determine the max supply, and release it in under 5 min, using something called **“Smart contract”**: lines of codes you write and deploy on the blockchain.\n\nIn January 2021, I programmed the first token I called “Wetchit” which means “spare change”. I couldn’t believe it. It took me less than 5 min :\n\n* I went on Youtube\n* Research “How to create a coin with Ethereum”\n* I watched the tutorial\n* Click on the Github link\n* Copy the code\n* Paste it on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)\n* I change the name of the token\n* Define the max supply, the abbreviation of the token name, the divisibility, and leave the rest unchanged.\n\nDone. I compile it. No error.\n\nNow, I connect my Metamask and it was ready to deploy.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn’t have enough Ethereum to pay gas fees.\n\nBut I had the option to test the coin on Kovan Test Network. I was working well. I sent some tokens to different wallets.\n\nI was like “WOW, this is the next thing”.\n\nDo you see how easy it was to create a token in under 5 min, with an open-source program?\n\nThat’s why you need to know some statistics.\n\n## Macro view of the cryptocurrency market\n\nHere are the statistics in 09/21/2021, based on Coinmarketcap:\n\n* [12,037](https://coinmarketcap.com/) cryptocurrencies\n* [$1,828,977,121,702](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) market cap\n* [$139,985,252,175](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) 24h volume\n\n12,037 coins !!!!!!! That’s 66.8722222222 times the number of fiat currencies.\n\nKnowing cryptocurrency market follows the same market rules, how do you choose the best ones to invest in?\n\nFirst, every coin has a cycle, like the figure from Binance above. We can group them into two categories :\n\n* Bitcoin season\n* Altcoin (all coins different from BTC) season\n\nWith the data record, scientists develop a model for the evolution of bitcoin, called the **Stock-To-Flow model**.\n\n![Stock-to-flow model of bitcoin](https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0\\*Xm_on3EwB4AOPcHP)\n\nIt represents the evolution of BTC since the beginning of its creation.\n\nOn the X-axis, you have Years, Y-axis you have the price per BTC.\n\nBitcoin has a 21 million coins supply. No more will be created.\n\n**If 75% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last 30 days it is Altcoin Month. Otherwise, it’s Bitcoin month.**\n\n**If 75% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last season (90 days) it is Altcoin Season. Otherwise, it’s Bitcoin season.**\n\n**If 75% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last year it is Altcoin Year. Otherwise, it’s Bitcoin year.**\n\nHere is an index to find out which season we are: [Blockchain Center index](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/altcoin-season-index/)\n\nThe macro view allows you to have a global view of the market.\n\n**Here is how to approach bitcoin and altcoin season from a macro perspective.**\n\nA great opportunity to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nCounterintuitive right?\n\nLemme explain.\n\nWhen you know everyone is buying a house from a specific location, what happen? Prices go up. You have then two choices :\n\n* FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): do whatever possible to have a slot for you (at a higher price with maybe a smaller slot because of the high demand)\n* Research an alternative to the location, not far and with a lower price.\n\nThat’s the same strategy here.\n\nIf it’s altcoin season, it means bitcoin is undervalued in some way. It’s ‘cheap’.\n\nWhen you buy an asset when it’s cheap, it gives you leverage to take profit sooner, when you needed.\n\nSame concept here. You want to invest in cheap options. In this case, it’s altcoins.\n\nNow, how do you choose which altcoin to invest in?\n\nHere is my methodology I called: ***themetapick***\n\n## How to invest in altcoins using themetapick strategy\n\n**12,036** altcoins. That’s a lot.\n\nHow to wrap your head around those?\n\n**1-Understand blockchain**\n\n**2-Understand cryptocurrency market (I gave you an overview, but you need to go deeper)**\n\nBegin here: [100 Tools and References to Begin with Blockchain and Cryptoassets (2021)](https://medium.com/coinmonks/100-tools-and-references-to-begin-with-blockchain-and-cryptoassets-2021-9d7efb5b4797)\n\n> **Do you homework for at least 50 hours.**\n\nAfter that you should be able to answer these questions :\n\n* What is a blockchain?\n* What is a market cycle?\n* What is the difference between bitcoin and Ethereum?\n* What is a support?

{"id": "aPdFaoCEhfOJw7RvZU5ft4gKdlOBm880xY-3q6pI7wg", "title": "Beginner guide for first-time cryptocurrency buyers (2021)", "body": "I hope this article will bring you value and help you begin your cryptocurrency’s journey\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*o4B0xbYSEXTXINqk2vWluA.png)\n\nSome coins you will meet during your journey\n\nDecember 2020. My cousin starts sending me updates about the cryptocurrency markets. I watched videos about bitcoin 2 years ago. I was not really interested in it at that time. What caught my eyes during those updates in how the market fluctuated.\n\nAt that time, bitcoin just passed $25k. I didn’t understand why it keep going up and down. I needed to go deeper. I kept digging. I started watching Youtube videos about financial markets, trading basics, and blockchain/currency explanations. It was eye-opening.\n\nFrom then, I started my journey with cryptocurrencies. I started with $2.\n\nFrom there, my journey was a rollercoaster trip :\n\n* Tesla bought some bitcoin\n* Beeple sold his NFTs for 69 million dollars\n* China cracks down miners in their country\n* Tesla stops accepting bitcoin\n* The market crashed in May 2021\n* El Salvador accepts bitcoin as a legal tender\n\nEvery single one of these events had an effect on the market.\n\nWhat kind of effect?\n\nLemme show you.\n\n## Understand market moves\n\n![Psychology of market cycle from Binance](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*dqswBfaNfUiTgEnL)\n\nI went through all of those phases.\n\nPrices of assets go down and up depending on the market.\n\nA definition of a market is where people meet and exchange value.\n\nFor example :\n\n* in the stock market, people exchange shares with money.\n* in the bond market where participants can issue new [debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt), known as the [primary market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_market), or buy and sell debt [securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)), known as the [secondary market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_market).\n\nAnd now, the crypto market: you buy coins in exchange for fiat.\n\nThe number of people buying coins and the amount of people selling determines the market moves.\n\nYou can analyze the market move using two factors :**Technical analysis**: look at the chart for different indicators of a pattern.\n\n![Typical chart view from tradingview.com](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*cv5HQb6Cs3pVe2ua.png)\n\n**Fundamental analysis**: looks at the bigger picture, regulation, market cap, other news, or issues around a specific market. This methodology looks at the BTC value for example, as a technology regardless of the current price and its outside prices in order to determine what will happen.\n\nWith the understanding of these two basics analysis of market moves, lemme explain the market conditions.\n\n**Bull market :**\n\n![The psychological effect of a bull market](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*z1G_i7F-Q52Lca6tDdnrFA.png)\n\nA [bull market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp) is a market that is on the rise and where the conditions of the economy are generally favorable.\n\nA bull market is typified by a sustained increase in prices. In the case of equity markets, a bull market denotes a rise in the prices of companies’ shares. In such times, investors often have faith that the [uptrend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptrend.asp) will continue over the long term. In this scenario, the country’s economy is typically strong and employment levels are high.\n\nIn the case of the crypto market, it means the price per coin (in $) is going up.\n\n**Bear market :**\n\n![The psychological effect of a bear market](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*2XvHswIwpRSPX902IWdwMg.png)\n\nA bear market exists in an economy that is receding and where most stocks are declining in value.\n\nA [bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp) is one that is in decline. A market is usually not considered a true “bear” market unless it has fallen 20% or more from recent highs. In a bear market, share prices are continuously dropping. This results in a downward trend that investors believe will continue; this belief, in turn, perpetuates the downward spiral. During a bear market, the economy slows down and unemployment rises as companies begin laying off workers.\n\nin the case of the crypto market, the price per coin is going down.\n\nBecause the financial markets are greatly influenced by investors’ attitudes, these terms also denote how investors feel about the market and the ensuing economic trends :\n\n> You are bullish if you believe that an asset will increase in price;\n>\n> You are bearish otherwise.\n\nNow you understand the basics of market moves, let’s jump into the cryptocurrency market.\n\n## Cryptocurrency as an investment\n\nInvesting is different from trading.\n\n> Trading means you are for the short term market move. You take profit as soon as the market move the way you predict it. If you open a position saying the trend is going up (meaning you are taking a long position), once it does, you take profit. If not, you lose. If you open a position saying the trend is going down (meaning you are taking the short position), once it does, you take your profit. If not you lose\n\nLike I said in [my recent article](https://medium.com/coinmonks/beginner-guide-for-first-time-nfts-buyers-2021-7abecb8dd059), Bitcoin was created in the context of an economic crisis. Satoshi Nakamoto quotes :\n\n***The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible*.**\n\nThis was the beginning of a long road.\n\nIn 2008, an anonymous person called Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin. It’s money on the Internet, without banks, without a middle man.\n\n**First, what is money?**\n\nMoney is often defined in terms of the three **functions** or **services** that it provides :\n\n* **Medium of exchange**: Money’s most important function is as a medium of exchange to ease transactions. Without money, all transactions would have to be conducted by **barter.** It involves the direct exchange of one good or service for another.\n* **Store of value:** To be a medium of exchange, money must hold its value over time; that is, it must be a store of value. Otherwise, money could not be stored for some period and remain valuable in exchange.\n* **Unit of account**: Money also functions as a unit of account, providing a *common measure of the value* of goods and services being exchanged.\n\nHow did Satoshi manage to create “Internet money” with these functions?\n\nHe leveraged something called **Blockchain**.\n\nBlockchain is a register where every transaction is recorded. Its characteristics :\n\n* **Immutability**: No possibility to make a change on the register once data is in the ledger.\n* **Decentralized**: No one owns the technology, it’s shared among the users.\n* **Anonymity**: You don’t need to give your credentials, a random password is given to you only.\n* **Security**: It’s almost impossible to hack because of the density of the network.\n\nWith it, Satoshi made Bitcoin. No possibility to double spend. A store of value. A medium of exchange. A unit of account. All combined using blockchain and cryptography.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin has exploded. After 13 years, a unit of bitcoin is now worth between $30k and $65k depending on the demand.\n\nIn 2015, a group of 8 persons figured out they can do more things with the blockchain: ***they can build some kind of contract on top of it***.\n\nGiven the fact that the blockchain is a register, what you put on it depends on the writer of the code. If they can figure out a way to codify functions and put it on the blockchain, they will have another use case.\n\n> And they made it. Ethereum was born.\n\nYou can create your coin(or token) like Bitcoin, determine the max supply, and release it in under 5 min, using something called **“Smart contract”**: lines of codes you write and deploy on the blockchain.\n\nIn January 2021, I programmed the first token I called “Wetchit” which means “spare change”. I couldn’t believe it. It took me less than 5 min :\n\n* I went on Youtube\n* Research “How to create a coin with Ethereum”\n* I watched the tutorial\n* Click on the Github link\n* Copy the code\n* Paste it on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)\n* I change the name of the token\n* Define the max supply, the abbreviation of the token name, the divisibility, and leave the rest unchanged.\n\nDone. I compile it. No error.\n\nNow, I connect my Metamask and it was ready to deploy.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn’t have enough Ethereum to pay gas fees.\n\nBut I had the option to test the coin on Kovan Test Network. I was working well. I sent some tokens to different wallets.\n\nI was like “WOW, this is the next thing”.\n\nDo you see how easy it was to create a token in under 5 min, with an open-source program?\n\nThat’s why you need to know some statistics.\n\n## Macro view of the cryptocurrency market\n\nHere are the statistics in 09/21/2021, based on Coinmarketcap:\n\n* [12,037](https://coinmarketcap.com/) cryptocurrencies\n* [$1,828,977,121,702](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) market cap\n* [$139,985,252,175](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) 24h volume\n\n12,037 coins !!!!!!! That’s 66.8722222222 times the number of fiat currencies.\n\nKnowing cryptocurrency market follows the same market rules, how do you choose the best ones to invest in?\n\nFirst, every coin has a cycle, like the figure from Binance above. We can group them into two categories :\n\n* Bitcoin season\n* Altcoin (all coins different from BTC) season\n\nWith the data record, scientists develop a model for the evolution of bitcoin, called the **Stock-To-Flow model**.\n\n![Stock-to-flow model of bitcoin](https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0\\*Xm_on3EwB4AOPcHP)\n\nIt represents the evolution of BTC since the beginning of its creation.\n\nOn the X-axis, you have Years, Y-axis you have the price per BTC.\n\nBitcoin has a 21 million coins supply. No more will be created.\n\n**If 75% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last 30 days it is Altcoin Month. Otherwise, it’s Bitcoin month.**\n\n**If 75% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last season (90 days) it is Altcoin Season. Otherwise, it’s Bitcoin season.**\n\n**If 75% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last year it is Altcoin Year. Otherwise, it’s Bitcoin year.**\n\nHere is an index to find out which season we are: [Blockchain Center index](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/altcoin-season-index/)\n\nThe macro view allows you to have a global view of the market.\n\n**Here is how to approach bitcoin and altcoin season from a macro perspective.**\n\nA great opportunity to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nCounterintuitive right?\n\nLemme explain.\n\nWhen you know everyone is buying a house from a specific location, what happen? Prices go up. You have then two choices :\n\n* FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): do whatever possible to have a slot for you (at a higher price with maybe a smaller slot because of the high demand)\n* Research an alternative to the location, not far and with a lower price.\n\nThat’s the same strategy here.\n\nIf it’s altcoin season, it means bitcoin is undervalued in some way. It’s ‘cheap’.\n\nWhen you buy an asset when it’s cheap, it gives you leverage to take profit sooner, when you needed.\n\nSame concept here. You want to invest in cheap options. In this case, it’s altcoins.\n\nNow, how do you choose which altcoin to invest in?\n\nHere is my methodology I called: ***themetapick***\n\n## How to invest in altcoins using themetapick strategy\n\n**12,036** altcoins. That’s a lot.\n\nHow to wrap your head around those?\n\n**1-Understand blockchain**\n\n**2-Understand cryptocurrency market (I gave you an overview, but you need to go deeper)**\n\nBegin here: [100 Tools and References to Begin with Blockchain and Cryptoassets (2021)](https://medium.com/coinmonks/100-tools-and-references-to-begin-with-blockchain-and-cryptoassets-2021-9d7efb5b4797)\n\n> **Do you homework for at least 50 hours.**\n\nAfter that you should be able to answer these questions :\n\n* What is a blockchain?\n* What is a market cycle?\n* What is the difference between bitcoin and Ethereum?\n* What is a support? What is a resistance?\n* What is a wallet? How to secure a wallet?\n* How to buy a coin?

Why do you have to buy from the company making them?\n* What is the best way to protect your coins?\n* What is the best way to lose your coins?\n* Why can’t you invest more than you can afford to lose?\n\nIf you cannot answer one of these questions after 50 hours, DM me on [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/themetaboy)or [Instagram](http://instagram.com/themetaboy), I will be happy to help.\n\nNow that you can answer all these questions. We can move forward.\n\nWhen It comes to investing, you have to consider 4 cases :\n\n\\*\\*Low risk/low reward potential: \\*\\*If you are a real risk-averse person, I suggest you look into the top 5 coins. You can find them on [Coinmarketcap](http://coinmarketcap.com/) or [coingecko](http://coingecko.com/).\n\n\\*\\*Low Risk/High Potential reward: \\*\\*These are scams. When you don’t have something to lose, you are not investing. you are gambling.\n\n\\*\\*High Risk/Low Potential reward: \\*\\*Think of it like digging a well, you go deeper and deeper, with all the risk, you finally find out there is a little quantity of groundwater. Worth the risk? Don’t know, maybe now you learned how to dig a well. In the case of cryptocurrencies, I may be a way to experiment.\n\n\\*\\*High risk/high potential reward: \\*\\*Those are the ones you need to investigate and it will take time.\n\nif you are a high-risk/high reward-looking person, the rest is for you.\n\n## Level 1: All new beginner\n\n***1-Unique value proposition***\n\nIs it clear?

Universe is mental” says the Kybalion. “Our intellect is what gives us Godlike powers” says the rational scientist.\n\nThat’s all interesting, but what about Adam? What can we learn from Michelangelo’s depiction of our fellow representative in the moment of genesis? Adam must’ve been doing something right to bring God close to him. It takes two to tango. Yet most will see him as lifeless or passive and thus overlook his genius. It’s his passivity that invites God. God comes to the relaxed. \n\nAdam wasn’t dead. He was skilfully relaxed with a dash of healthy indifference which allowed life to approach and run through him. Can you imagine if he instead started to scream with excitement “Oh my! Look everyone! God is approaching me”? God would probably cringe, “that guy’s too clouded to receive my presence” and change directions.\n\nAs an artist, I can attest that most – if not all – of my ideas and inspirations have come effortlessly when I was simply receptive. Not when I was labouring behind my desk but when I was still in nature, shower, or bed. Yes, the soil must have been tended, the mind prepared. But all good things appear on their own accord. Suddenly the lotus blossoms. \n\nInstead of relaxing during vacation, or thinking of calm as simply good for our mental health, Bill Murray sees it as an ingredient for effectiveness. He’s talking about effortless action, calm in motion. Murray understands [wu wei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvZi7ZV-SWI).\n\nHaste makes waste. Note feedback from reality and go with the waves, not against them.

My cousin starts sending me updates about the cryptocurrency markets. I watched videos about bitcoin 2 years ago. I was not really interested in it at that time. What caught my eyes during those updates in how the market fluctuated.\n\nAt that time, bitcoin just passed $25k. I didn’t understand why it keep going up and down. I needed to go deeper. I kept digging. I started watching Youtube videos about financial markets, trading basics, and blockchain/currency explanations. It was eye-opening.\n\nFrom then, I started my journey with cryptocurrencies. I started with $2.\n\nFrom there, my journey was a rollercoaster trip :\n\n* Tesla bought some bitcoin\n* Beeple sold his NFTs for 69 million dollars\n* China cracks down miners in their country\n* Tesla stops accepting bitcoin\n* The market crashed in May 2021\n* El Salvador accepts bitcoin as a legal tender\n\nEvery single one of these events had an effect on the market.\n\nWhat kind of effect?\n\nLemme show you.\n\n## Understand market moves\n\n![Psychology of market cycle from Binance](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*dqswBfaNfUiTgEnL)\n\nI went through all of those phases.\n\nPrices of assets go down and up depending on the market.\n\nA definition of a market is where people meet and exchange value.\n\nFor example :\n\n* in the stock market, people exchange shares with money.\n* in the bond market where participants can issue new [debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt), known as the [primary market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_market), or buy and sell debt [securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)), known as the [secondary market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_market).\n\nAnd now, the crypto market: you buy coins in exchange for fiat.\n\nThe number of people buying coins and the amount of people selling determines the market moves.\n\nYou can analyze the market move using two factors :**Technical analysis**: look at the chart for different indicators of a pattern.\n\n![Typical chart view from tradingview.com](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*cv5HQb6Cs3pVe2ua.png)\n\n**Fundamental analysis**: looks at the bigger picture, regulation, market cap, other news, or issues around a specific market. This methodology looks at the BTC value for example, as a technology regardless of the current price and its outside prices in order to determine what will happen.\n\nWith the understanding of these two basics analysis of market moves, lemme explain the market conditions.\n\n**Bull market :**\n\n![The psychological effect of a bull market](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*z1G_i7F-Q52Lca6tDdnrFA.png)\n\nA [bull market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp) is a market that is on the rise and where the conditions of the economy are generally favorable.\n\nA bull market is typified by a sustained increase in prices. In the case of equity markets, a bull market denotes a rise in the prices of companies’ shares. In such times, investors often have faith that the [uptrend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptrend.asp) will continue over the long term. In this scenario, the country’s economy is typically strong and employment levels are high.\n\nIn the case of the crypto market, it means the price per coin (in $) is going up.\n\n**Bear market :**\n\n![The psychological effect of a bear market](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*2XvHswIwpRSPX902IWdwMg.png)\n\nA bear market exists in an economy that is receding and where most stocks are declining in value.\n\nA [bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp) is one that is in decline. A market is usually not considered a true “bear” market unless it has fallen 20% or more from recent highs. In a bear market, share prices are continuously dropping. This results in a downward trend that investors believe will continue; this belief, in turn, perpetuates the downward spiral. During a bear market, the economy slows down and unemployment rises as companies begin laying off workers.\n\nin the case of the crypto market, the price per coin is going down.\n\nBecause the financial markets are greatly influenced by investors’ attitudes, these terms also denote how investors feel about the market and the ensuing economic trends :\n\n> You are bullish if you believe that an asset will increase in price;\n>\n> You are bearish otherwise.\n\nNow you understand the basics of market moves, let’s jump into the cryptocurrency market.\n\n## Cryptocurrency as an investment\n\nInvesting is different from trading.\n\n> Trading means you are for the short term market move. You take profit as soon as the market move the way you predict it. If you open a position saying the trend is going up (meaning you are taking a long position), once it does, you take profit. If not, you lose. If you open a position saying the trend is going down (meaning you are taking the short position), once it does, you take your profit. If not you lose\n\nLike I said in [my recent article](https://medium.com/coinmonks/beginner-guide-for-first-time-nfts-buyers-2021-7abecb8dd059), Bitcoin was created in the context of an economic crisis. Satoshi Nakamoto quotes :\n\n***The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible*.**\n\nThis was the beginning of a long road.\n\nIn 2008, an anonymous person called Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin. It’s money on the Internet, without banks, without a middle man.\n\n**First, what is money?**\n\nMoney is often defined in terms of the three **functions** or **services** that it provides :\n\n* **Medium of exchange**: Money’s most important function is as a medium of exchange to ease transactions. Without money, all transactions would have to be conducted by **barter.** It involves the direct exchange of one good or service for another.\n* **Store of value:** To be a medium of exchange, money must hold its value over time; that is, it must be a store of value. Otherwise, money could not be stored for some period and remain valuable in exchange.\n* **Unit of account**: Money also functions as a unit of account, providing a *common measure of the value* of goods and services being exchanged.\n\nHow did Satoshi manage to create “Internet money” with these functions?\n\nHe leveraged something called **Blockchain**.\n\nBlockchain is a register where every transaction is recorded. Its characteristics :\n\n* **Immutability**: No possibility to make a change on the register once data is in the ledger.\n* **Decentralized**: No one owns the technology, it’s shared among the users.\n* **Anonymity**: You don’t need to give your credentials, a random password is given to you only.\n* **Security**: It’s almost impossible to hack because of the density of the network.\n\nWith it, Satoshi made Bitcoin. No possibility to double spend. A store of value. A medium of exchange. A unit of account. All combined using blockchain and cryptography.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin has exploded. After 13 years, a unit of bitcoin is now worth between $30k and $65k depending on the demand.\n\nIn 2015, a group of 8 persons figured out they can do more things with the blockchain: ***they can build some kind of contract on top of it***.\n\nGiven the fact that the blockchain is a register, what you put on it depends on the writer of the code. If they can figure out a way to codify functions and put it on the blockchain, they will have another use case.\n\n> And they made it. Ethereum was born.\n\nYou can create your coin(or token) like Bitcoin, determine the max supply, and release it in under 5 min, using something called **“Smart contract”**: lines of codes you write and deploy on the blockchain.\n\nIn January 2021, I programmed the first token I called “Wetchit” which means “spare change”. I couldn’t believe it. It took me less than 5 min :\n\n* I went on Youtube\n* Research “How to create a coin with Ethereum”\n* I watched the tutorial\n* Click on the Github link\n* Copy the code\n* Paste it on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)\n* I change the name of the token\n* Define the max supply, the abbreviation of the token name, the divisibility, and leave the rest unchanged.\n\nDone. I compile it. No error.\n\nNow, I connect my Metamask and it was ready to deploy.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn’t have enough Ethereum to pay gas fees.\n\nBut I had the option to test the coin on Kovan Test Network. I was working well. I sent some tokens to different wallets.\n\nI was like “WOW, this is the next thing”.\n\nDo you see how easy it was to create a token in under 5 min, with an open-source program?\n\nThat’s why you need to know some statistics.\n\n## Macro view of the cryptocurrency market\n\nHere are the statistics in 09/21/2021, based on Coinmarketcap:\n\n* [12,037](https://coinmarketcap.com/) cryptocurrencies\n* [$1,828,977,121,702](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) market cap\n* [$139,985,252,175](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) 24h volume\n\n12,037 coins !!!!!!! That’s 66.8722222222 times the number of fiat currencies.\n\nKnowing cryptocurrency market follows the same market rules, how do you choose the best ones to invest in?\n\nFirst, every coin has a cycle, like the figure from Binance above. We can group them into two categories :\n\n* Bitcoin season\n* Altcoin (all coins different from BTC) season\n\nWith the data record, scientists develop a model for the evolution of bitcoin, called the **Stock-To-Flow model**.\n\n![Stock-to-flow model of bitcoin](https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0\\*Xm_on3EwB4AOPcHP)\n\nIt represents the evolution of BTC since the beginning of its creation.\n\nOn the X-axis, you have Years, Y-axis you have the price per BTC.\n\nBitcoin has a 21 million coins supply. No more will be created.\n\n**If 75% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last 30 days it is Altcoin Month. Otherwise, it’s Bitcoin month.**\n\n**If 75% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last season (90 days) it is Altcoin Season. Otherwise, it’s Bitcoin season.**\n\n**If 75% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last year it is Altcoin Year. Otherwise, it’s Bitcoin year.**\n\nHere is an index to find out which season we are: [Blockchain Center index](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/altcoin-season-index/)\n\nThe macro view allows you to have a global view of the market.\n\n**Here is how to approach bitcoin and altcoin season from a macro perspective.**\n\nA great opportunity to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nCounterintuitive right?\n\nLemme explain.\n\nWhen you know everyone is buying a house from a specific location, what happen? Prices go up. You have then two choices :\n\n* FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): do whatever possible to have a slot for you (at a higher price with maybe a smaller slot because of the high demand)\n* Research an alternative to the location, not far and with a lower price.\n\nThat’s the same strategy here.\n\nIf it’s altcoin season, it means bitcoin is undervalued in some way. It’s ‘cheap’.\n\nWhen you buy an asset when it’s cheap, it gives you leverage to take profit sooner, when you needed.\n\nSame concept here. You want to invest in cheap options. In this case, it’s altcoins.\n\nNow, how do you choose which altcoin to invest in?\n\nHere is my methodology I called: ***themetapick***\n\n## How to invest in altcoins using themetapick strategy\n\n**12,036** altcoins. That’s a lot.\n\nHow to wrap your head around those?\n\n**1-Understand blockchain**\n\n**2-Understand cryptocurrency market (I gave you an overview, but you need to go deeper)**\n\nBegin here: [100 Tools and References to Begin with Blockchain and Cryptoassets (2021)](https://medium.com/coinmonks/100-tools-and-references-to-begin-with-blockchain-and-cryptoassets-2021-9d7efb5b4797)\n\n> **Do you homework for at least 50 hours.**\n\nAfter that you should be able to answer these questions :\n\n* What is a blockchain?\n* What is a market cycle?\n* What is the difference between bitcoin and Ethereum?\n* What is a support? What is a resistance?\n* What is a wallet? How to secure a wallet?\n* How to buy a coin? Where to buy a coin?\n* How to transfer a coin?\n* What is the difference between a cold wallet and a hot wallet?\n* What is a seed phrase? What is the difference between a seed phrase and a password?\n* What is the difference between Bitcoin and Dogecoin?\n* What is the difference between Dogecoin and Shiba INU ?\n* What is the difference between Ethreum and the coin built on top of Ethreum?\n* What is a gas fee?

Why do you have to buy from the company making them?\n* What is the best way to protect your coins?\n* What is the best way to lose your coins?\n* Why can’t you invest more than you can afford to lose?\n\nIf you cannot answer one of these questions after 50 hours, DM me on [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/themetaboy)or [Instagram](http://instagram.com/themetaboy), I will be happy to help.\n\nNow that you can answer all these questions. We can move forward.\n\nWhen It comes to investing, you have to consider 4 cases :\n\n***Low risk/low reward potential***: If you are a real risk-averse person, I suggest you look into the top 5 coins. You can find them on [Coinmarketcap](http://coinmarketcap.com/) or [coingecko](http://coingecko.com/).\n\n***Low Risk/High Potential reward:*** These are scams. When you don’t have something to lose, you are not investing. you are gambling.\n\n***High Risk/Low Potential reward:*** Think of it like digging a well, you go deeper and deeper, with all the risk, you finally find out there is a little quantity of groundwater. Worth the risk? Don’t know, maybe now you learned how to dig a well. In the case of cryptocurrencies, I may be a way to experiment.\n\n***High risk/high potential reward:*** Those are the ones you need to investigate and it will take time.\n\nif you are a high-risk/high reward-looking person, the rest is for you.\n\n## Level 1: All new beginner\n\n***1-Unique value proposition***\n\nIs it clear?

Broadly speaking, these projects inscribe their rules, rights and responsibilities to smart contracts which live indefinitely and immutably on the blockchain. Holders of the DAO’s corresponding crypto token may participate in votes which automatically invoke those contracts to execute functions and pass new legislation.\n\nThe prominent early experiment of this scheme was aptly named *The DAO*. The DAO deployed to the Ethereum blockchain in April 2016 on the back of one of the most successful crowdsourcing campaigns in history, drawing in over US$100 million and nearly 14% of the ETH in circulation.\n\nThe stated purpose of The DAO was much the same as any corporation — To create value and enrich stakeholders. Through the wisdom of the crowd, proposals would be curated and voted on to receive funds from The DAO’s treasury with the expectation that profit would flow back to the investors.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/996/1\\*wfIFsy9EGy9ckI3L34QbTw.png)\n\nNo hierarchies here!\n\nIt was a radical experiment. Could an organization with no hierarchies, belonging to no nation state, holding no intellectual property and enlisting no employees succeed in a post-industrial world and create profit for its some 18,000+ beneficiaries?\n\nUnfortunately, the experiment ended almost immediately.\n\nOn June 17th, two months after The DAO launched, a hacker exploited a combination of flaws in its code to drain US$70 million worth of ETH from The DAO’s treasury. The impact rippled around the blockchain world, and the Ethereum network resorted to a controversial hard fork to retrieve the stolen funds. It sounded a predictable death knell for The DAO, which was defunct and delisted from major exchanges before the end of the year.\n\nThat was the last time anybody tried the great DAO experiment. . .\n\n. . . Just kidding!\n\n*The DAO* is now a distant memory and there are well over 100 DAO projects holding billions of dollars in capital, the ranks of which include Maker, Aragon, Gitcoin, Moloch, The LAO, MetaCartel and now even Uniswap. These organizations are deeply important in the crypto ecosystem — Maker’s USD stablecoin product, DAI, has over US$3 billion in circulation.\n\nAs many DAOs as there are, most of them fall within just one of two categories: Governing DeFi protocols and issuing venture capital or grants. There are a few practical reasons for this:\n\n1.  DeFi is hot hot hot. After all, decentralized finance is the reason Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in the first place.\n2.  Governing DeFi protocols is mostly a number-tweaking game. It’s relatively simple to turn dials and pull levers by vote.\n3.  The blockchain ecosystem is new and booming. There’s a lot to be built and as much funding needed.\n4.  Giving out funding is also fairly simple. Vote on proposals and send over the money when they pass.\n\nIt appears that DAOs have found their early foothold in these niches. But where do they go from here? If DAOs are to evolve further into a general alternative to the hierarchical corporation, they need the capability to act in more substantial ways than merely moving money around in digital space. Even the simplest company needs somebody to answer the phone. Of course, these DAOs do exist and some of them will even answer the phone. How is that?\n\nThis is something of an open secret — our DAOs are neither truly autonomous nor fully decentralized.\n\nBehind all DAOs are people who do everything not programmed into its smart contract infrastructure. Maker, for example, elects a representative to manually transfer votes from their forum into an on-chain governance proposal. Uniswap proposals are implemented by their core development team. And *somebody* has to maintain all of these websites. These organizations have engineers, managers, executives (and executive assistants), marketers and more working off-chain and behind the scenes doing the myriad things needed by any functional organization. Today’s DAOs have wrapped much or most of their *product* *functionality* into a decentralized, autonomous framework. They themselves, however, are neither of those. There is still an air gap between vital organizational functions and the blockchain — a gap between the decentralized constituency and their organization.\n\nThis is important. Operations beyond the scope of the DAOs programming and oversight of its constituents are then externalities. This means that DAOs are subject to externalities **intrinsic to the operation of the organization itself. **That is, participants in supposedly decentralized and autonomous organizations are necessarily beholden to individuals and processes which they have no direct oversight over and which they must trust to act in their best interest. Uniswap’s community must take it on faith that their proposals will be executed by the core team. Maker’s community relies on privileged persons to facilitate fundamental functions of governance. If these trusted processes fail, DAO participants suffer the consequences.\n\nWhat can we do? How can DAOs become truly autonomous and fully decentralized?\n\nAnswer: They can’t and shouldn’t.\n\nFor one thing, it’s dubious if something can be “fully decentralized” at all. Take *The DAO* for example. It could be persuasively argued that all of the power in The DAO had been concentrated (read: centralized) into smart contract code written in just a few months by just a couple of people. It was a single point of failure, exploitable by a lone hacker to bring the whole thing crashing down. The more we obsess over what we are “decentralizing”, the more we may be turning a blind eye to where power is in fact being centralized. Nathan Schneider of the Metagovernance Project writes as much in his paper *Decentralization: an incomplete ambition*:\n\n*“…even the most apparently decentralized systems have shown the capacity to produce economically and structurally centralized outcomes. The rhetoric of decentralization thus obscures other aspects of the re-ordering it claims to describe. It steers attention from where concentrations of power are operating, deferring worthwhile debate about how such power should operate.”*\n\nIt is difficult to even imagine a fully decentralized organization, or at least a functional one. For all practical purposes, individuals occasionally need to make unilateral decisions in order to get things done. By *reductio ad absurdum* this seems axiomatic. Only one person should type on a keyboard at a time, and you can’t take a phone call by committee. It took *Twitch Plays Pokémon* 16 days to beat the Elite Four. Your average 8-year old can do it in a couple of days.\n\nUniswap has a core team of developers because a core team gets things done. While the blockchain space is still new enough to permit the occasional lone genius, gentrification is happening and the expectations for organizations are growing. As the demands on DAOs grow, it is more likely that power will be increasingly centralized to satisfy those demands rather than decentralized, as hierarchal organizational structures are a proven method of productivity.\n\n**So we pose a more important question: How can we maintain accountability over centralized aspects of DAO operations?**\n\nThe point here is that if a centralization of power is directly accountable to the constituency of a DAO, then it’s no longer an externality. This is the basic principle of popular sovereignty, the origins of which date back at least as far as the Roman Republic, wherein persons are *given* the responsibility of representing the will of the people. Such representatives are, in theory, held accountable to the people by the possibility of being deposed. Democracy has not come up with much better in thousands of years. The practicality of Republicanism is the same as for our DAOs — even now in the information era it’s unfeasible for an entire population to vote on every little thing. Instead, we give somebody temporary power to do it for us and check in on them every so often.\n\nThe capability for such *delegation* is critical for DAOs if they are to scale, broaden their operations, and cooperate with each other. It’s also critical that they do not further compromise their “decentralized” and “autonomous” ethos in doing so.\n\nWe propose a system for DAOs to encapsulate such centralization, resource allocation and privilege within an additive, accountable framework. This framework allows DAOs to conditionally delegate power and resources to chosen or yet-undetermined entities in pursuit of its directives via their existing governance mechanisms. By this process, DAOs can eliminate the air gap between off-chain operations and on-chain accountability. By the same system, we enable a new species of entrepreneur to emerge in the DAO ecosystem and push the flywheel of value creation for the space as a whole.\n\nMore about Cambrian Protocol’s accountability framework in [**Part 2**](https://medium.com/@nicwickman/accountability-is-everything-8f18ac5fa716)**!**\n", "timestamp": 1633472341, "digest": "DbSmaxc8DQyP6zFs04qHkKA0PBoiutgOlNqIc_Geqpw", "contributor": "0xCef01218f74937187c93EcD12EdAFE76fbbEEc8B"}
