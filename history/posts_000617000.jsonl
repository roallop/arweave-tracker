That's a lot.\n\nLet’s dive into a couple key players and identify what makes them unique in NFT conversations happening today.\n\n### SuperRare\n\n[SuperRare](https://superrare.co/) allows whitelisted creators to issue 1/1 NFTs, exemplifying the name ‘Super Rare’ by leaning on the fact that each and every token is highly exclusive and of the finest quality.\n\n[// GENERATE by fvckrender](ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/18159)\n\nCuration on SuperRare is key, as only about 1% of all applicants make their way onto the platform.\n\nSuperRare places a strong emphasis on the social nature of NFT collecting, allowing users to like posts and share their collection through a username linked to their Ethereum wallet.\n\nAll purchases on SuperRare are made exclusively in ETH.\n\n[SuperRare purchase](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1349811824082911232?s=20)\n\n### Nifty Gateway\n\n[Nifty Gateway](https://niftygateway.com/) is currently leading in sales volume, largely thanks to its fiat onramps that allow collectors to purchase NFTs with a credit card.\n\nWhile Nifty also offers 1/1 pieces, it’s seen the most success from the issuance of editions - or multiple copies of a specific type of NFTs. \n\nNifty leverages ‘[open editions](https://niftygateway.com/collections/everything)’ or FOMO-induced drops in which an unlimited number of editions can be for a finite period of time (commonly 5 minutes or less). \n\nEach open edition is sold at a base price, and after the window closes, no more of that NFT are ever issued. This has led to a vibrant secondary market and the emergence of novel releases including ‘packs’ or NFT drops with different rarities received at the time of purchase.\n\nNifty also leans heavily on curation, as only whitelisted creators are able to release NFTs, almost all of which are marketed as ‘drops’ that sell out in a matter of minutes.\n\n`https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1352774900163829760?s=20`\n\n### Rarible\n\nNot all NFT marketplaces require permission to access.\n\n[Rarible](https://rarible.com/) allows anyone to quickly and easily issue an NFT, and is underpinned by a governance token - [RARI](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rarible) - that gives users the ability to vote on changes to the protocol.\n\nWhile Rarible has had to deal with its fair share of growing pains including wash trading and fraud, the principle of allowing anyone to mint an NFT in a matter of seconds provides a fantastic testing ground for those new to the space.\n\nJust ask Marc Cuban, who minted his first NFT on Rarible earlier this week.\n\n[Cuban](https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1354498247700709388?s=20)\n\n### Zora\n\n[Zora](https://zora.co/) offers a universal market protocol for media ownership through the standardization of cryptomedia - or NFTs that include both a media and market components.\n\nzNFTs add an order book directly to the NFT, allowing creators to buy and sell the token directly without having to interface through any of the platforms mentioned above.\n\nAll zNFTs are issued as 1/1’s and indexed as a part of a global registry, meaning no two NFTs can be replicated.\n\nWhile still in its infancy, Zora’s push to make NFTs platform agnostic has garnered interest from projects like [Catalog](https://catalog.works/) and [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) - both of which are utilizing Zora for the NFTs being issued on their respective products.\n\n### OpenSea\n\n[OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) is an NFT issuance platform that doubles as the first NFT marketplace - offering a novel home for creators and collectors to access an aggregate view of all their NFTs collected from the various platforms listed above.\n\nOpenSea allows anyone to create NFTs, either as 1/1s or as editions.\n\nThe marketplace encompasses everything from crypto art to gaming assets and much more, and is long seen as the home for a global secondary market on any and all NFTs that exist today.\n\nOpenSea accepts a variety of different currencies, giving creators the ability to accept payment in ETH, DAI, USDC or custom social tokens like WHALE, COIN or HUE.\n\n## The Resources\n\nThe most important aspect of NFTs are the creators themselves - specifically with many of them releasing content across multiple marketplaces in various shapes and forms.\n\nI’ve found the best place to keep up with the top artists to be [cryptoart.io](https://cryptoart.io/) by [Richard Chen](https://twitter.com/richardchen39), offering a fantastic breakdown of the top sellers across SuperRare, Nifty Gateway, MakersPlace, Async Art, and KnownOrigin.\n\n![Credit: cryptoart.io/data](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6544aa15-594e-40e4-b540-b7bed4f1f762.jpeg?height=1040&width=2308)\n\nOther valuable resources to keep up with the ever changing NFT landscape include but are not limited to:\n\n### Starter Guides\n\n- [Collecting NFTs and Digital Art](https://www.loop-news.com/p/beginners-guide-collecting-nfts-and)\n- [Beginners Guide to NFTs](https://linda.mirror.xyz/df649d61efb92c910464a4e74ae213c4cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d)\n- [Non Fungible Tokens](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/) -

Whereas a dollar bill has the same value as any other dollar bill (meaning they are fungible), one car has a drastically different value from another (meaning they are non-fungible).\n\nNFTs frequently represent scarce digital content, and allow for provable ownership (otherwise known as provenance) of media files which have historically been free to reproduce.\n\nNFTs allow creators to assign scarcity and value to a digital file, including anything from text to images, videos and sound. \n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1347395072933838851?s=20)\n\nThink of a digital version of the Mona Lisa, where anyone can take a screenshot - but there is only one true owner. This is an NFT.\n\n## NFT Issuance\n\nThe process of creating an NFT is not as scary.\n\nCreators upload files like mp4s, gifs or jpgs to a distributed database like [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and issue a token that includes that file in its metadata.\n\nI found this description from the [NFT Skeptics Guide](https://justincone.com/posts/nft-skeptics-guide/) particularly accurate as it demystifies the seemingly dodgy world of web3.\n\n‘Token + Media = Cryptoart’\n\nThe token itself is not cryptoart. The NFT points to something else and says ‘Hey, this thing and I are joined at the hip. We’re inseparable. Think of us as one’ \n\n![Credit to NFT Skeptic Guide for visualization, Carlos for the rebrand](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f503408e-8428-418a-91db-8ce898492374.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nEveryone knows how to create a mp4, gif, and jpg, but very few people know how to issue a token on a blockchain.\n\nThis is where issuers - or platforms that help users create (or issue) tokens come into play.\n\n## Issuance Landscape\n\nThere are now nearly 50 different platforms to mint NFTs. That's a lot.\n\nLet’s dive into a couple key players and identify what makes them unique in NFT conversations happening today.\n\n### SuperRare\n\n[SuperRare](https://superrare.co/) allows whitelisted creators to issue 1/1 NFTs, exemplifying the name ‘Super Rare’ by leaning on the fact that each and every token is highly exclusive and of the finest quality.\n\n[// GENERATE by fvckrender](ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/18159)\n\nCuration on SuperRare is key, as only about 1% of all applicants make their way onto the platform.\n\nSuperRare places a strong emphasis on the social nature of NFT collecting, allowing users to like posts and share their collection through a username linked to their Ethereum wallet.\n\nAll purchases on SuperRare are made exclusively in ETH.\n\n[SuperRare purchase](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1349811824082911232?s=20)\n\n### Nifty Gateway\n\n[Nifty Gateway](https://niftygateway.com/) is currently leading in sales volume, largely thanks to its fiat onramps that allow collectors to purchase NFTs with a credit card.\n\nWhile Nifty also offers 1/1 pieces, it’s seen the most success from the issuance of editions - or multiple copies of a specific type of NFTs. \n\nNifty leverages ‘[open editions](https://niftygateway.com/collections/everything)’ or FOMO-induced drops in which an unlimited number of editions can be created for a finite period of time (commonly 5 minutes or less). \n\nEach open edition is sold at a base price, and after the window closes, no more of that NFT are ever issued. This has led to a vibrant secondary market and the emergence of novel releases including ‘packs’ or NFT drops with different rarities received at the time of purchase.\n\nNifty also leans heavily on curation, as only whitelisted creators are able to release NFTs, almost all of which are marketed as ‘drops’ that sell out in a matter of minutes.\n\n[Nifty](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1352774900163829760?s=20)\n\n### Rarible\n\nNot all NFT marketplaces require permission to access.\n\n[Rarible](https://rarible.com/) allows anyone to quickly and easily issue an NFT, and is underpinned by a governance token - [RARI](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rarible) - that gives users the ability to vote on changes to the protocol.\n\nWhile Rarible has had to deal with its fair share of growing pains including wash trading and fraud, the principle of allowing anyone to mint an NFT in a matter of seconds provides a fantastic testing ground for those new to the space.\n\nJust ask Marc Cuban, who minted his first NFT on Rarible earlier this week.\n\n[Cuban](https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1354498247700709388?s=20)\n\n### Zora\n\n[Zora](https://zora.co/) offers a universal market protocol for media ownership through the standardization of cryptomedia - or NFTs that include both a media and market components.\n\nzNFTs add an order book directly to the NFT, allowing creators to buy and sell the token directly without having to interface through any of the platforms mentioned above.\n\nAll zNFTs are issued as 1/1’s and indexed as a part of a global registry, meaning no two NFTs can be replicated.\n\nWhile still in its infancy, Zora’s push to make NFTs platform agnostic has garnered interest from projects like [Catalog](https://catalog.works/) and [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) - both of which are utilizing Zora for the NFTs being issued on their respective products.\n\n### OpenSea\n\n[OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) is an NFT issuance platform that doubles as the first NFT marketplace - offering a novel home for creators and collectors to access an aggregate view of all their NFTs collected from the various platforms listed above.\n\nOpenSea allows anyone to create NFTs, either as 1/1s or as editions.\n\nThe marketplace encompasses everything from crypto art to gaming assets and much more, and is long seen as the home for a global secondary market on any and all NFTs that exist today.\n\nOpenSea accepts a variety of different currencies, giving creators the ability to accept payment in ETH, DAI, USDC or custom social tokens like WHALE, COIN or HUE.\n\n## The Resources\n\nThe most important aspect of NFTs are the creators themselves - specifically with many of them releasing content across multiple marketplaces in various shapes and forms.\n\nI’ve found the best place to keep up with the top artists to be [cryptoart.io](https://cryptoart.io/) by [Richard Chen](https://twitter.com/richardchen39), offering a fantastic breakdown of the top sellers across SuperRare, Nifty Gateway, MakersPlace, Async Art, and KnownOrigin.\n\n![Credit: cryptoart.io/data](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6544aa15-594e-40e4-b540-b7bed4f1f762.jpeg?height=1040&width=2308)\n\nOther valuable resources to keep up with the ever changing NFT landscape include but are not limited to:\n\n### Starter Guides\n\n- [Collecting NFTs and Digital Art](https://www.loop-news.com/p/beginners-guide-collecting-nfts-and)\n- [Beginners Guide to NFTs](https://linda.mirror.xyz/df649d61efb92c910464a4e74ae213c4cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d)\n- [Non Fungible Tokens](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/) -
