史料として\n\n[比叡山](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1)[延暦寺](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BB%B6%E6%9A%A6%E5%AF%BA)は、「[古都京都の文化財（京都市、宇治市、大津市）](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8F%A4%E9%83%BD%E4%BA%AC%E9%83%BD%E3%81%AE%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E8%B2%A1)」を構成する17の寺社のひとつとして、[ユネスコ](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E9%9A%9B%E9%80%A3%E5%90%88%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E6%A9%9F%E9%96%A2)の[世界遺産](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E9%81%BA%E7%94%A3)に登録されています \\[4\\]\\[5\\]\\[6\\]。また、比叡山延暦寺は、国宝である[根本中堂](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BB%B6%E6%9A%A6%E5%AF%BA%E6%A0%B9%E6%9C%AC%E4%B8%AD%E5%A0%82)をはじめとして、複数の国宝や数多くの重要文化財を保有しています。このように、比叡山延暦寺は歴史的文化的に重要な場所であり、かつては現存しているよりも遥かに多くの文化財や史料を保有していました。\n\nしかし、比叡山延暦寺の文化財や史料は、[1571年の延暦寺焼打ち（元亀の法難）](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1%E7%84%BC%E3%81%8D%E8%A8%8E%E3%81%A1_(1571%E5%B9%B4))で被害を受け、その多くが失われました。そのため、かつての延暦寺の境内に存在した寺社の様子を伝える史料は数少ないです。\n\n『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』は、比叡山延暦寺の境内や坂本地区の寺社を描いた現存する古絵図の中では、もっとも詳細なものであるとされており、[1571年](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1%E7%84%BC%E3%81%8D%E8%A8%8E%E3%81%A1_(1571%E5%B9%B4))以前に存在した可能性のある寺社も描かれています \\[7\\]。そのため、『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』は、かつての比叡山延暦寺に存在した寺社の様子を知るための貴重な史料です。\n\n###

画像を入手した経緯\n\nぼくは、正規の手続きに従って、[国立公文書館](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E7%AB%8B%E5%85%AC%E6%96%87%E6%9B%B8%E9%A4%A8)に対して、『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』の第1鋪と第2鋪の２つの古地図のデジタルデータ（画像ファイル）の利用申請を提出し、下記の手数料等を支払って、2021年4月にこれらの２つの古地図の画像ファイルを入手しました。\n\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（中判特殊撮影）の料金 : 4コマ × 543円/コマ ＝ 2,172円\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（高精細特殊撮影）の料金 : 32コマ × 3,300円/コマ ＝ 105,600円\n* 上記撮影データのDVDＲへの書込みの料金 : DVDＲ 2枚 × 543円/枚 ＝ 1,086円\n* 梱包・送料 : 1件 × 520円/件 ＝ 520円\n* 手数料等合計金額 : 109,378円\n\n第1鋪と第2鋪の2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、縦横サイズが大きいために、国立公文書館は、1回の撮影で地図全体を1枚の写真におさめることができませんでした。 （※第1鋪と第2鋪の縦横サイズは、それぞれ、幅280cm×高さ187.5cm、幅279cm×高さ187.5cm です。） そのため、国立公文書館は、それぞれの地図ごとに、1枚の地図を複数回に分けて撮影しました。 それによって、2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、16枚の画像ファイルに分割されました。 （また、それに加えて、それぞれの古地図の、表表紙と裏表紙の写真も撮影されました。最終的に、2枚の古地図の画像ファイルは、それぞれ18枚になりました（合計36枚）。）\n\nぼくは、16枚ずつに分割された画像ファイルをつなぎ合わせて、この[『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E9%96%80%E4%B8%89%E5%A1%94%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC%E6%83%A3%E7%B5%B5%E5%9B%B3)の第1鋪と第2鋪の古地図の全体図の画像ファイルをつくりました。\n\nぼくは、国立公文書館の[「デジタル画像等の二次利用についての利用規約」](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/support/use.html)にもとづき、これらの古地図の画像ファイルを、ウィキメディア・コモンズのウェブサイトで、パブリックドメインとして公開しました。\n\n*

画像を入手した経緯\n\nぼくは、正規の手続きに従って、[国立公文書館](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E7%AB%8B%E5%85%AC%E6%96%87%E6%9B%B8%E9%A4%A8)に対して、『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』の第1鋪と第2鋪の２つの古地図のデジタルデータ（画像ファイル）の利用申請を提出し、下記の手数料等を支払って、2021年4月にこれらの２つの古地図の画像ファイルを入手しました。\n\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（中判特殊撮影）の料金 : 4コマ × 543円/コマ ＝ 2,172円\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（高精細特殊撮影）の料金 : 32コマ × 3,300円/コマ ＝ 105,600円\n* 上記撮影データのDVDＲへの書込みの料金 : DVDＲ 2枚 × 543円/枚 ＝ 1,086円\n* 梱包・送料 : 1件 × 520円/件 ＝ 520円\n* 手数料等合計金額 : 109,378円\n\n第1鋪と第2鋪の2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、縦横サイズが大きいために、国立公文書館は、1回の撮影で地図全体を1枚の写真におさめることができませんでした。 （※第1鋪と第2鋪の縦横サイズは、それぞれ、幅280cm×高さ187.5cm、幅279cm×高さ187.5cm です。） そのため、国立公文書館は、それぞれの地図ごとに、1枚の地図を複数回に分けて撮影しました。 それによって、2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、16枚の画像ファイルに分割されました。 （また、それに加えて、それぞれの古地図の、表表紙と裏表紙の写真も撮影されました。最終的に、2枚の古地図の画像ファイルは、それぞれ18枚になりました（合計36枚）。）\n\nぼくは、16枚ずつに分割された画像ファイルをつなぎ合わせて、この[『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E9%96%80%E4%B8%89%E5%A1%94%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC%E6%83%A3%E7%B5%B5%E5%9B%B3)の第1鋪と第2鋪の古地図の全体図の画像ファイルをつくりました。\n\nぼくは、国立公文書館の[「デジタル画像等の二次利用についての利用規約」](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/support/use.html)にもとづき、これらの古地図の画像ファイルを、ウィキメディア・コモンズのウェブサイトで、パブリックドメインとして公開しました。\n\n*

Trader Joe combines DEX services with DeFi lending to offer leveraged trading. Trader Joe’s products are community driven which allows them to give fees collected from liquidation and swaps back to the users via the JOE/xJOE staking mechanism. JOE is a governance token that also rewards its holders with a share of exchange revenues.\n\n## What is Avalanche?\n\nAvalanche is an open-source, proof-of-stake smart contracts platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications. Avalanche offers near-instant transaction finality and uses the native AVAX token to pay for gas and secure the network by staking.\n\n## A step-by-step guide on how to lend assets on Trader Joe:\n\n* Visit https://traderjoexyz.com and connect your wallet.\n\n![Trader Joe Connect Wallet Pop Up](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/efB_GbeDHGtEh7AgCYgGX.png?height=1474&width=2618)\n\n* If your wallet is not on the Avalanche Network, a window will prompt you to switch to the network. Click on “Switch to Avalanche” and sign it with your wallet.\n* Once you switch to the Avalanche Network, you will see your wallet address up in the top right corner of the page.\n* Now you will head over to the “Pool” tab where you can pick a pool to deposit to.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q4-Pb_FT1Bbnla9XOtEVY.png?height=1464&width=2094)\n\n* In this example I selected the “AVAX-USDT.e” pool as seen in the picture below.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/X2__-6iGxvbMaXwkfjhZc.png?height=1240&width=2020)\n\n* Depending on the amount of each token you have in your wallet, you can choose a specific amount of one and the website will fill in the amount for the other token. Tip: You can use the “Max” button for the coin with the smaller dollar value.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZGu8xkIJwZpsOp7GXNmzE.png?height=972&width=736)\n\n* When you have decided the amount of each asset you would like to deposit as liquidity, you will click on the button underneath to deposit.\n* The transaction will take a few seconds to go through and once you get a confirmation screen, you can be assured your assets are now deposited into the pool of your choice!\n\n  ## Resources:\n\n  **Avalanche C-Chain Block Explorer:**\n\n  [https://cchain.explorer.avax.network/](https://cchain.explorer.avax.network/)\n\n  **Ethereum -→ Avalanche Bridge:** \n\n  [https://bridge.avax.network/login](https://bridge.avax.network/login)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635889228, "digest": "X3BX21tJRxAOxD9VRHyPTGh79-fSCQ_Ffy15E8iUIgI", "contributor": "0x3eC44A823E07555B5f889d8d954eec736eb5865b"}

I am NOT going in there!”*\n\nI shout at our tour guide as I run away from the entrance.\n\nThese people must think I’m crazy…and very naive.\n\nI feel tricked. Duped. Forced to go somewhere I don’t want to go.\n\nEveryone else is still in line, entering single-file. But not me.\n\n**I’m going to stay above ground, where the sun still shines and no impenetrable rock walls will smush you dead.**\n\nMaybe I can meet them on the other side of their perilous expedition?\n\nI don’t know my way around this foreign land, but I can ask for directions.\n\nEither way, my decision is final. My feet are staying planted in the city of surface-dwellers.\n\nUntil, with the encouragement of God, my mind is starting to change.\n\n**He’s convincing me to go—through the caring words and actions of 3 other believers on this epic, shared journey.**\n\nI feel supported. Loved. Understood.\n\nGod is speaking through them, helping me overcome this foolish fear that has plagued me since childhood.\n\nI can’t believe I’m saying this, but I might actually do it…let’s go.\n\n**I’m in Israel. It’s 2014.**\n\nWe’re approaching the end of our unforgettable 2-week trip across The Holy Land.\n\nSomehow, we’ve herded 99 believers from my local church across this diverse terrain—and haven’t lost anyone.\n\nI thought maybe we’d misplace at least one person in the Negev Desert or while hiking Mount Carmel.\n\nBut nope. We’re all still here. A hearty golf-clap, we all deserve.\n\nOur two luxury, air-conditioned tour buses have weaved and swayed through 100’s of narrow, winding roads so that we could ***see***, and ***hear***, and ***touch***, and ***smell***, and even ***taste*** the Earthly epicenter of our faith…\n\nWe **picked sacred stones** from the lush, tree-lined Valley of Elah—where David killed Goliath…\n\n**Sang songs of worship to God** in a wooden boat on the iconic Sea of Galilee…\n\n**Entered The Church of The Nativity** in Bethlehem, seeing the exact spot where Jesus was born…\n\nAnd **gazed upon The Old City of Jerusalem** from atop The Mount of Olives—where Our Good Lord ascended to Heaven…\n\nFor all of us, The Bible has now been brought to life.\n\nIt’s easy to forget while reading God’s Word:\n\nThese places actually exist.\n\nNow we’re in Jerusalem. This is the last stop on our Biblical journey before we endure the long plane ride home.\n\nWe know we’re hitting all the main attractions:\n\nThe Western Wall, Gethsemane, Golgotha.\n\n**But Marty, our experienced tour guide, loves to surprise us.** He doesn’t want us to know every place we’re going.\n\nI’ve enjoyed his surprises so far. In our daily American lives, we expect to knowing exactly what we’re doing. We’re control freaks.\n\nIt feels good to let go of my calendar for a while.\n\nThat is, until, we arrive at our newest surprise location just on the outskirts of Jerusalem…\n\n**It’s called The City of David.**\n\nMarty tells us this is the oldest (and most significant) archeological site in Israel.\n\nThis 60-acre national park is situated on a small hill near The Western Wall.\n\nAbout 3,000 years ago, King David left his beloved city of Hebron to come here—transforming Jerusalem into a political and religious capital for the entire Jewish people.\n\nMarty also says this historical city is well-known for it’s vast, impressive system of caves and tunnels…\n\nThe most popular choice for tourists is called **Hezekiah’s Tunnel.**\n\nKing Hezekiah constructed this ancient marvel of engineering to redirect water from the Gihon Spring (outside the city walls) to the Pool of Siloam (inside the city walls).\n\nHe knew the Assyrians were planning to attack. But now, they would have to do it without a convenient source of hydration.\n\n\\*“And guess what? \\*he says. ***Surprise!*** *That’s our next destination. We’re going to walk inside of it.”*\n\nMarty continues: *“The tunnel is about 1/3 of a mile long and still contains water…”*\n\nHuh? What? He’s still talking? I can’t focus anymore.\n\nI’m distracted by my own anxious thoughts.\n\n**They’re expecting ME to stroll through this dark, wet tunnel like a New York City sewer rat?**\n\nI’d rather be a test subject in a pre-human trial medical experiment than scurry along inside this wretched hole bored into rock.\n\nBut I keep moving forward like the good, little church group tourist that I am…\n\nWe get into the lengthy, winding line leading to the entrance.\n\nThey hand each of us **a flashlight.** Oh boy.\n\nAs we turn the final corner, I peek ahead to investigate my impending doom.\n\nHmmmm….that entrance looks a tad narrow. I hope it widens more once we get inside.\n\nThe line shuffles forward until my right foot breaks the threshold of my greatest fear.\n\n**Uh oh. This is not getting any wider. It’s actually narrower.**\n\nI try to pump up my confidence with a little reassuring internal dialogue:\n\n*“It’s OK, Ryan. You can do this. Don’t stop now.”*\n\nI take one small step after the other. Maybe I won’t freak out if I move slowly.\n\nBut that doesn’t matter. I can still **feel the dense, cold rock of the tunnel walls squeezing tighter on both sides.**\n\nIn my everyday life, if I have the choice between an enclosed elevator or spacious stairs, I’ll meet you at the top using pure foot power.\n\nSure, this may seem like a healthy cardiovascular decision. But it’s not. I’m just succumbing to my fear of smaller spaces—which I’m trying to overcome right now.\n\nI arrive at the final staircase, leading down into the cave.\n\n**And then, at this last moment, I do it. I freak out.**\n\n*“Nope! I’m not going in THERE!*, I blurt out to my fellow travelers (and complete strangers) surrounding me.\n\nI turn around and push my way back through the line.\n\nI don’t care how significant this place is…\n\nI don’t care that brave men of God built this water-guiding wonder some 2,700 years ago by digging from both sides and somehow meeting in the middle.\n\nGood for them. I’m proud of ’em. I’ll drop a like on their Facebook page.\n\nRight now, I’m outta here!\n\nMarty immediately went to find me. And a concerned couple from our group followed him.\n\n*“Ryan, what’s wrong?”*, he asked.\n\n***“I’m claustrophobic.*** *So yeah, I won’t be spelunking in Hezekiah’s Historic Hole of Horrors today please.”*\n\n*“I know you can do this. I’ve gone through this tunnel many times with people who don’t like small spaces. Here, I know what will help….”*\n\nHe points at the couple who have been witnessing my hysteria since I was handed the flashlight.\n\n*Walk inside with Mark and Amber. It’s easier to do this if you feel you’re not alone.”*\n\n*“Sure, we’ll gladly do that*“, they say.\n\n*“Uhhhh, I guess so, I respond. We’ll see how this goes…”*\n\nWe weave back through the throng of tourists toward the tunnel entrance.\n\nAmber stands in front of me. Mark stands behind me. And we walk inside.\n\nThe walls start to squeeze again. The roof feels low—even though I’m only 5’5″.\n\nBut I keep moving. Because I no longer feel alone in my fear.\n\nI am literally surrounded by believers who have my back—while also leading from the front.\n\n**We are now an unstoppable train of believers, chugging forward one rail at a time toward our next station.**\n\n*Wait a second.

I’m shocked, but it’s now hard fact…\n\nI’m starting to ***enjoy*** our adventure through this cramped, damp hole in the rock.\n\nHezekiah’s Tunnel is a miraculous feat of ingenuity fueled by God.\n\nOur army of flashlights scares away enough of the darkness so we can see God’s beautiful work around us.\n\nAnd I’m steeped in the anticipation of what we would see next around each corner…\n\nThe cool, clear water flows through the entire channel. Sometimes I’m sloshing it with my feet, other times I’m wading up to my waist.\n\nBut even when my gap of air is limited, I continue moving forward with my Christian Crew.\n\nWe talk, we joke, we even sing some worship songs along the way.\n\n**And finally, after 1748 long feet, we exited through the other end.**\n\nThank you, Lord for giving me the visible, reassuring support I needed through the hands and feet of other believers.\n\n**He was reminding me: *“I am always with you. You are never alone.”***\n\nToday, God works most of his miracles through His Church—the forgiven believers who do His good works.\n\nWe all need help from other Jesus-followers to overcome our fears and live up to our new image in Christ.\n\n**Sadly, many of us have been more disconnected from The Body since the pandemic started.**\n\nWe’ve been isolated from the people with whom we’ll be spending the rest of eternity.\n\nNow it’s time. We’ve been hiding in our spiritual silos for long enough.\n\nWe need to know each other better. And encourage one another while on Earth.\n\nThis has been a recent problem in my life…\n\nWith the pandemic and moving to a nearby city, we still haven’t found a new home church.\n\nBut to be honest, I haven’t looked hard either.\n\nIt’s time to fix this. And to reconnect with my Jesus-following family.\n\n> “And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, **not giving up meeting together**, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.”\n>\n> —Hebrews 10:24-25\n\n***Who in our eternal family can you help and encourage?…***\n\n***Who can help and encourage you?…***\n\nWe all need support to use our heavenly gifts, overcome our fears, and live out our faith for The Gospel.\n\nThe greatest Godly power we have is when we’re together, encouraging each other, helping each other, bearing each other’s burdens.\n\n> “Again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.\n>\n> For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.”\n>\n> —Matthew 18:19-20\n\n**This broken world continues to become a darker place by the day.**\n\nAnd according to Scripture, the sinfulness, the temptations, the evil growing here will only get stronger.\n\nWe need each other more than ever now…\n\nBecause since Jesus won the eternal war, we have become **Satan’s #1 target.**\n\nSo let’s lead one another from the front, and guide each other from behind…\n\nJust like Mark and Amber did for me when I was freaking out in fear inside Hezekiah’s beautiful, magnificent tunnel.", "timestamp": 1635889173, "digest": "M7P1rU2QYtJn94gxpvPOKll_ohFc4WWmPv5YWeJsCUw", "contributor": "0x68876Bd92Ba03AAAD29812B7D62491cA80Fa0E74"}

史料として\n\n[比叡山](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1)[延暦寺](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BB%B6%E6%9A%A6%E5%AF%BA)は、「[古都京都の文化財（京都市、宇治市、大津市）](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8F%A4%E9%83%BD%E4%BA%AC%E9%83%BD%E3%81%AE%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E8%B2%A1)」を構成する17の寺社のひとつとして、[ユネスコ](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E9%9A%9B%E9%80%A3%E5%90%88%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E6%A9%9F%E9%96%A2)の[世界遺産](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E9%81%BA%E7%94%A3)に登録されています \\[4\\]\\[5\\]\\[6\\]。また、比叡山延暦寺は、国宝である[根本中堂](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BB%B6%E6%9A%A6%E5%AF%BA%E6%A0%B9%E6%9C%AC%E4%B8%AD%E5%A0%82)をはじめとして、複数の国宝や数多くの重要文化財を保有しています。このように、比叡山延暦寺は歴史的文化的に重要な場所であり、かつては現存しているよりも遥かに多くの文化財や史料を保有していました。\n\nしかし、比叡山延暦寺の文化財や史料は、[1571年の延暦寺焼打ち（元亀の法難）](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1%E7%84%BC%E3%81%8D%E8%A8%8E%E3%81%A1_(1571%E5%B9%B4))で被害を受け、その多くが失われました。そのため、かつての延暦寺の境内に存在した寺社の様子を伝える史料は数少ないです。\n\n『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』は、比叡山延暦寺の境内や坂本地区の寺社を描いた現存する古絵図の中では、もっとも詳細なものであるとされており、[1571年](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1%E7%84%BC%E3%81%8D%E8%A8%8E%E3%81%A1_(1571%E5%B9%B4))以前に存在した可能性のある寺社も描かれています \\[7\\]。そのため、『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』は、かつての比叡山延暦寺に存在した寺社の様子を知るための貴重な史料です。\n\n###

画像を入手した経緯\n\nぼくは、正規の手続きに従って、[国立公文書館](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E7%AB%8B%E5%85%AC%E6%96%87%E6%9B%B8%E9%A4%A8)に対して、『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』の第1鋪と第2鋪の２つの古地図のデジタルデータ（画像ファイル）の利用申請を提出し、下記の手数料等を支払って、2021年4月にこれらの２つの古地図の画像ファイルを入手しました。\n\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（中判特殊撮影）の料金 : 4コマ × 543円/コマ ＝ 2,172円\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（高精細特殊撮影）の料金 : 32コマ × 3,300円/コマ ＝ 105,600円\n* 上記撮影データのDVDＲへの書込みの料金 : DVDＲ 2枚 × 543円/枚 ＝ 1,086円\n* 梱包・送料 : 1件 × 520円/件 ＝ 520円\n* 手数料等合計金額 : 109,378円\n\n第1鋪と第2鋪の2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、縦横サイズが大きいために、国立公文書館は、1回の撮影で地図全体を1枚の写真におさめることができませんでした。 （※第1鋪と第2鋪の縦横サイズは、それぞれ、幅280cm×高さ187.5cm、幅279cm×高さ187.5cm です。） そのため、国立公文書館は、それぞれの地図ごとに、1枚の地図を複数回に分けて撮影しました。 それによって、2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、16枚の画像ファイルに分割されました。 （また、それに加えて、それぞれの古地図の、表表紙と裏表紙の写真も撮影されました。最終的に、2枚の古地図の画像ファイルは、それぞれ18枚になりました（合計36枚）。）\n\nぼくは、16枚ずつに分割された画像ファイルをつなぎ合わせて、この[『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E9%96%80%E4%B8%89%E5%A1%94%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC%E6%83%A3%E7%B5%B5%E5%9B%B3)の第1鋪と第2鋪の古地図の全体図の画像ファイルをつくりました。\n\nぼくは、国立公文書館の[「デジタル画像等の二次利用についての利用規約」](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/support/use.html)にもとづき、これらの古地図の画像ファイルを、ウィキメディア・コモンズのウェブサイトで、パブリックドメインとして公開しました。\n\n*

I had a flight back to the states the next morning which I’d have to get up early for. Still, there I was, trying every cheap trick I knew (hard refresh, switch to Firefox?) to get Klima DAO’s application to work for me. I needed to claim my aKLIMA to swap them for KLIMA tokens. Then I’d ‘stake’ my KLIMA and start reaping a 300,000% annual percentage yield (“APY”). Or I could sell my KLIMA tokens, which had just launched public trading hours earlier at a price of $323. Post launch, KLIMA immediately skyrocketed north of $1,200. Then it kept climbing.\n\nIf all of this sounds like a foreign language, it’s because the processes can indeed be pretty labyrinthine for the uninitiated. I’ve been deep in the crypto and ‘DeFi’ trenches for months. Navigating the Klima DAO launch was still challenging. My interest was less motivated by ‘generational wealth’ (as opposed to the majority of the folks in the #price-talk channel in Klima DAO’s Discord server). Rather, I ‘reserved’ a few aKLIMA \\~6 weeks ago to properly diligence this emergent, ambitious, complicated entity, whose stated goal is to make carbon offsets more expensive.\n\nIn the short time since they first crossed my radar, Klima DAO has tapped a very powerful asset, namely the confluence of two major memes in today’s zeitgeist ⚡. The first is the need for climate action. People know we need to take action about climate. The chance to *feel* like you’re doing something is irresistible, especially when so much discussion about climate is couched in the language of certain doom. In parallel, the allure of making money, whether it be in sports betting, stocks, or crypto is oozing out of every pore of our increasingly digital, gamified society 📈.\n\nKlima DAO has harnessed both these movements to gain a massive amount of momentum. But what *is* Klima DAO? It is at once a discord server with 30,000 members, an organization with aims of being “decentralized” and “autonomous” (read as: governed by their own members, ideally leveraging as much code as process for the autonomous part). It has its own crypto token, KLIMA, and a corresponding set of monetary policies. And its aim is to impact prices in a very ‘real-world’ market.\n\nSpecifically? Klima DAO wants to help fight climate change. In their words:\n\n> Klima DAO is a collective of environmentalists, developers and entrepreneurs who aim to pool their knowledge and expertise to drive change in the carbon markets, today. (see [here](https://docs.klimadao.finance/klima.fi-manifesto))\n\nWhy carbon markets? Let’s dive down the rabbit hole 🐰🕳️.\n\n### A word on carbon markets 🏭\n\nThe size of the carbon market as a whole was [north of $250B last year](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-carbon-idUSKBN29W1HR). There are lots of products and submarkets under this umbrella, including [voluntary and mandatory](https://www.offsetguide.org/understanding-carbon-offsets/carbon-offset-programs/mandatory-voluntary-offset-markets/) carbon markets. We’re focused on voluntary markets here, i.e. the ones that companies and people like you and I participate in when we buy ‘carbon offsets’.\n\nWhat are carbon offsets? Specifically, one carbon offset represents the avoidance or removal of one tonne of CO2 equivalent emissions (“CO2-e”). These offsets are supplied by projects that can prove they prevented or removed emissions to parties that want to reduce their *net* emissions footprint 👣. An example of a project that would supply carbon offsets might be one that preserves a rainforest whose flora sucks up carbon 🦜. Carbon offset projects are subject to a bevy of different verification standards. [Verra](https://verra.org/project/vcs-program/), which has facilitated the issuance of [almost 800M carbon offsets](https://verra.org/), and [Gold Standard](https://www.goldstandard.org/) are among the most prominent.\n\nCarbon offsets are purchased by all kinds of organizations. The market for voluntary markets is a beast of its own, forecast to [grow to $1B this year](https://www.wsj.com/articles/carbon-offsets-are-used-by-companies-seeking-net-zero-but-concerns-persist-11635079489) (as an aside, the fact that Klima DAO’s market cap at one point equaled the size of the entire voluntary offset markets’ is fun). Meanwhile, the parade of corporations touting new net-zero emissions targets would have been hard to miss over the past years. Companies like [Delta and Google](https://www.statista.com/chart/23751/companies-buying-carbon-offsets/) have emissions targets they would otherwise exceed were it not for carbon offsets. Carbon offset pricing varies depending on their source; the different projects that produce them all have different economics. Many offsets on the market are pretty cheap at current; a simple benchmark would be around $10 per tonne of CO2e.\n\n### The Klima DAO mission 🎯\n\nKlima DAO exists to make the price of carbon offsets more expensive 📈. Why? At current, there’s no real cost associated with *emitting* CO2. There almost definitely should be. If we were able to calculate the full cost of carbon emissions, taking into account all negative externalities on society, e.g. the future costs of global warming, habitat destruction, worse air quality, etc., emissions might [be very expensive](https://twitter.com/XavierHelgesen/status/1446620855677583360).\n\nKlima DAO identifies this challenge as core to their mission. They write:\n\n> *Companies and consumers do not pay (enough) for these negative externalities, and are therefore emitting too much carbon. This is a market failure – the market by itself does not internalize the costs of these emissions...A perfect market should price in carbon.* ([here](https://docs.klimadao.finance/blogs/about-carbon-offsets))\n\nWhile there’s no price for carbon, there *is* a price for carbon offsets. What if the carbon offsets became more scarce? In lieu of a true tax on carbon, this would increase their price and act as a ‘cost’ on the heavy CO2 emitters that buy them.\n\nThat’s exactly what Klima DAO wants to do — they want to become a “black hole” for carbon offsets 🕳️. First, their system (the “protocol”) has to attract capital. To do so, they’ve embraced the financial infrastructure of crypto. Which is smart — there are few forces stronger than the willingness of crypto market participants to ‘ape’ 🦍 (i.e. deploy large sums of capital with minimal diligence) into the latest token, provided it has momentum. Once the capital starts flowing, Klima DAO uses it to siphon carbon offsets out of traditional markets.\n\nHow does this work? Let’s take a look under the hood 🏎️.\n\n### The mechanics ‎‍🔧\n\nHow does Klima DAO acquire carbon offsets? First, offsets have to be taken out of traditional markets and brought on-chain. Klima DAO relies on the [Toucan Protocol](https://docs.toucan.earth/protocol/introduction/master) to execute this; Toucan operates a ‘carbon bridge’ that takes carbon offsets from registries we’ve discussed (currently they work exclusively with [Verra’s VCUs](https://verra.org/project/vcs-program/registry-system/verified-carbon-units-vcus/)) and brings them onto [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), a blockchain built on top of Ethereum. In the process, the offsets are turned into a commoditized, tradable unit represented by a token, [BCT](https://cryptobuyingtips.com/guides/how-to-buy-toucan-protocol-base-carbon-tonne-bct).\n\n> *Base Carbon Tonnes (BCT) is a reference token representing one tonne of carbon from the Verra Verified Carbon Unit (VCU) registry from 2008 or later, bridged by the Toucan Protocol.*\n\nKlima DAO doesn’t just raise money to buy BCTs though. That would be boring. Instead, Klima DAO introduces its own token, “KLIMA,” too. Why? To gamify the entire system. KLIMA is the piece of the puzzle 🧩 that , coupled with the voracious appetite and capital from the crypto market, powers the ‘black hole’ for carbon offsets.\n\nHow does KLIMA supercharge new BCT purchases? To start, they back each KLIMA with at least one BCT. Before new KLIMA can be created, Klima DAO has to acquire more BCT:\n\n> *...a new KLIMA can only be minted by locking a BCT (Base Carbon Tonne) in the Klima DAO Treasury and removing it from the market...* *the treasury backs every KLIMA token by at least one tonne of carbon offsets, which guarantees that users can always sell their KLIMA for at least one tonne.“* (Source [here](https://docs.klimadao.finance/))\n\nFrom there, incentives / monetary mechanics are layered in to accelerate BCT accumulation:\n\n* When the total market capitalization of KLIMA is higher than the value of the carbon offsets in its treasury, Klima DAO issues bonds to market participants in exchange for BCTs.\n* Importantly, these bonds are redeemable for KLIMA at a *discounted rate* to market price (after a vesting period has passed), making buying BCTs to acquire these bonds an attractive way to get your hands on KLIMA.\n* By selling the bonds, Klima DAO increases its store of BCTs. With more BCT in hand, it can issue new KLIMA.\n* If a virtuous cycle of price appreciation can be upheld, more investors will elect to contribute BCT to the Klima DAO treasury in order to get a discount on new KLIMA.\n\nHow does Klima DAO try to keep up said virtuous cycle of price appreciation? For one, if you believe carbon offsets will become more expensive over time, then the value of Klima DAO’s treasury holdings should appreciate too. For that trade you could just buy BCTs on your own though, so Klima DAO also introduces a profit distribution mechanism as an additional incentive to hold KLIMA. This mechanism distributes newly minted KLIMA to existing investors who choose to ‘stake’ their holdings. You can think of this as a sort of dividend rate for holding KLIMA, designed to attract even more investors to the Klima DAO ecosystem:\n\n> *Staking is designed to incentivize longer-term holding of KLIMA, and to give market participants exposure to the rising price of carbon. The longer participants hodl \\[sic — it’s a crypto joke\\] and stake, the more they compound and the more KLIMA tokens they will have when they unstake.* (More [here](https://docs.klimadao.finance/klima-dao-ecosystem)).\n\nAt launch, the APY for staking KLIMA was an eye-watering 300,000%. While the rate has come down since, at the initial rate, it would only have taken you 33 days to double your KLIMA holdings when staked. How is this APY set? This is where things get a touch sophisticated. Suffice it to say that it is contingent *both* on a rewards rate that Klima DAO sets via governance, and by market dynamics (e.g. how much new KLIMA is minted in any given period and how many people have staked their KLIMA).\n\nThe main takeaway for us is that Klima DAO pays out newly minted KLIMA to its holders as an additional incentive for holding the token. This newly minted KLIMA is also inflationary though, which *should* put a damper on the KLIMA price. What happens when it doesn’t though? Proceed 👉.\n\n### The bull run 🐂\n\nIf you were an early member of the Klima DAO community, you could buy KLIMA at [$10 per token](https://klimadao.medium.com/what-is-klima-dao-initial-discord-offering-5735c996c2ac). As of this writing, the token trades around $2,000 (down from a high of $3,500). And holders who stake their KLIMA are still earning four-five digit APYs to boot 💰. At $3,500 per KLIMA (approximately the high watermark so far), Klima DAO’s market capitalization eclipsed the $1B mark 🤯.\n\nWhy are people piling into KLIMA? Sure, there are probably some valiant climate warriors involved who participate in hopes of punishing companies that emit a lot of carbon. Getting investment exposure to the carbon offset market, as far as a long-term strategy is concerned, also has tailwinds speaking in favor of it. Even before Klima DAO and Toucan launched, the [offset market was heating up](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/27/bank-of-america-carbon-offset-market-to-x-50-to-meet-net-zero-goals.html). Some people may also buy KLIMA to participate in governing the DAO — tokens will grant future voting rights 🗳️.\n\nI assume however that it’s the promise of big time investment returns that the majority of participants at this stage are interested in. The crypto infrastructure that Klima DAO has integrated speaks directly to a cohort of rabid crypto traders who are always scouring the internet for their next big score. Klima DAO has captured their capital and attention to build momentum for the project. And they’ve done so very consciously. As one anon Klima DAO leader said in a recent [interview on the Bankless podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bankless/id1499409058?i=1000535838797):\n\n> *We’re Game-stopping the voluntary carbon market; using the incentive structure to drive more and more demand for these carbon credits.*\n\nThe alluring power of the games Klima DAO has designed is perhaps most clearly exhibited in Klima DAO’s mantra, (🌳, 🌳), which combines the deciduous tree emoji with “(3,3).” (3,3) is a game theory meme taken from another DAO that highlights that the most beneficial action for market participants is to stake their asset and sit pretty (nash equilibrium, for you nerds 🤓).\n\nWith the price of KLIMA holding strong for now, it looks like folks are heeding the (🌳, 🌳) call. Call it incentives, gamification 🎮, or gambling 🎰, it’s working.\n\n### The impact 💥\n\nLast week, Klima DAO noted it has already brought [8M tonnes of carbon offsets on-chain](https://twitter.com/KlimaDAO/status/1452635939889729536) (perhaps this gone up since). Estimates of what percentage of the total current available supply of carbon offsets in voluntary markets vary, but some pegged it as high as 5%. (We’ll revisit this claim later in “The Challenges” section).\n\nThe carbon market is notoriously difficult to quantify and measure, plus it’s super fractured, so it’s hard for us to corroborate exactly what % supply of which market Klima DAO has hoovered up. The claim that we’ve seen a measurable impact on price does seem to be corroborated by whispers and reports from the offset industry and carbon market themselves though. See for instance this from [Carbon Pulse last week](https://carbon-pulse.com/142130/):\n\n> Standardised voluntary emissions reduction (VER) prices for CORSIA- and nature-based units trended up towards fresh record highs on exchanges this week, with voluntary carbon market (VCM) participants citing involvement by speculative firms and crypto traders for the increase.\n\nIf this can be sustained, it could accelerate the rate at which companies are forced to explore real solutions to *reduce* their emissions, not just offset them. Further, if the price of carbon offsets rises, it could attract more offsetting projects to come online and fill the supply gap.\n\n> \\*Importantly, carbon offsets provide critical financing for sustainability projects, including forest conservation and renewable energy generation. (More [here](https://klimadao.medium.com/carbon-markets-retail-offset-pricing-4eab0f6196c0)).\n\nEspecially projects known as “frontier” carbon offsetting or removal projects, like [chemically bonding carbon to minerals and turning it into stone](https://www.heirloomcarbon.com/), need capital to prove the viability of their processes, navigate formal verification, and to subsequently scale them. If carbon offsets cost $10, these projects aren’t viable. If offsets cost $100 or $1,000, the economics might change.\n\nZooming out, what Toucan is doing to create a more liquid market for BCTs is very important. As we noted above, legacy markets are fractured and often illiquid; there are countless benefits that come with the transparency that a more liquid market would provide. We’ll save a deeper exploration of these for a future report on the Toucan protocol and BCTs themselves. Finally, at the risk of glossing over the obvious, I think what Klima DAO is doing in general, namely trying to turn crypto infrastructure, capital, and trading habits into climate impact, is laudable.\n\n### The challenges 🤨\n\nAt the beginning of this piece, I noted that the chance to *feel* like you’re contributing positively towards climate is a key motivator in today’s zeitgeist. Klima DAO offers this in droves. But how real is the climate impact here? Considering the allure of the rewards systems that Klima DAO has set up and the momentum that their token has garnered since launching a few weeks ago, this is a key question. If a bunch of people allocate time and money to this space and it turns out the climate promises weren’t all we thought they were, that could be a big blow to future crypto / climate projects.\n\nThe first question we should ask in aims of full intellectual honesty here is whether the carbon offsetting market is where we should be focusing our attention at all. Should the idea of a carbon-neutral oil & gas industry even exist?\n\nLet’s first look at the challenges inherent to offsets themselves. For one, carbon offsets aren’t all created equal, even if they all end up in the same commoditized on-chain pool (BCTs). One tonne of direct air carbon capture (DAC) vs one tonne of offsets achieved via reforestation doesn’t achieve the same thing, at least not right away; the tonne offset via reforestation takes longer to manifest (trees need time to mature), and assumes the trees won’t be burned or logged, even hundreds of years from now.\n\nCarbon offsets with older vintages can also be [considerably cheaper than newer offsets](https://about.bnef.com/blog/unlike-fine-wines-carbon-offsets-get-worse-with-age/). In pursuit of best practices around offsetting, corporations may try to purchase offsets that were issued in the same year in which the emissions they are looking to offset occurred. If an offset was issued in 2015, there are fewer potential buyers for it, as fewer companies had committed to any net-emissions targets then or were tracking their emissions readily. While carbon offsets in general may get more expensive in the coming decades, older vintages could actually be depreciating assets.\n\nKlima DAO’s current model is set up to buy the cheapest offsets. At this stage, that can mean buying lower quality (older vintage) offsets as well more of the “future avoidance” types of offsetting projects instead of say, the DAC carbon removals we discussed earlier. Of course, in many cases, these could still be offsets an Exxon or a Chevron would have bought otherwise, so this isn’t a critical flaw by any means.\n\nMoving on, it also seems like almost every day, some new [Fortune 500 company is beleaguered by charges](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/shell-s-carbon-offset-claims-show-task-ahead-for-un-climate-talks) that a carbon offset project they worked with didn’t prevent, capture or sequester CO2 in the way it said it would, or that standards weren’t upheld over time. At the level of standards and offset verification, even institutions like Verra have to [play defense re: accusations](https://verra.org/verra-response-to-guardian-article-on-carbon-offsets-used-by-major-airlines/) that projects in their registry aren’t up to snuff.\n\nNow, on the carbon offset *markets*. Carbon offset markets are historically plagued by double counting issues. Not only have there been significant challenges with carbon offsets being sold multiple times (if two different organizations can buy and then re-sell the same offset, they shouldn’t both be able to claim it towards their net emissions goals). Additionally, as Paul Gambill (CEO of [Nori](https://keepcool.co/nori-deepdive/)) explains, countries in which offsets are produced [often claim the same offsets that other entities then purchase](https://twitter.com/paulgambill/status/1449517958531674112/video/1) (another form of double counting). Offsets can be often flawed even before they are brought on-chain. These things aren’t Klima DAO’s fault, but they do raise the question of how worthwhile targeting offsets as a change mechanism is to begin with.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that companies that want access to a lot of offsets increasingly sidestep traditional carbon offset markets entirely. They’ve already forecasted the supply crunch Klima DAO hopes to accelerate and they hire teams to do diligence on and [buy entire offsetting projects](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/052621-larger-buyers-of-carbon-credits-buying-entire-projects) to produce offsets for them exclusively (and at scale). While they’re still competing for the same resource conceptually, as they opt out of the markets that Klima DAO targets, Klima DAO may need to shift its tactics.\n\nThis speaks to a broader point to me that Klima DAO is quite conscious of, namely that the supply of offsets itself is inflationary. You can occasion a short-term run on supply, sure. But once you’ve pulled it off, you’d likely see a raft of new offsetting projects come online. This would be a good thing for the planet, but perhaps not for the Klima DAO ecosystem. With a new wave of offset supply coming online, the value of the BCTs in Klima DAO’s treasury could decrease substantially from a high watermark. In short, even if BCTs do increase in value over time, it won’t be linear. I’ll be interested to see how carbon offset price volatility impacts Klima DAO’s ability to sustain a positive feedback loop. How strong will (🌳, 🌳) be if the treasury value gets cut in half?\n\nPerhaps most importantly, and more specific to Klima DAO, while the offsets that Toucan Protocol bridges [are listed as ‘retired’ in the Verra registry](https://twitter.com/wagmianon/status/1453140959013838848), what’s critical is that the offsets are fully retired *on-chain* too.\n\nPursuant to this point, a quote we read earlier might have raised flags for you 🚩:\n\n> ...the treasury backs every KLIMA token by at least one tonne of carbon offsets, which guarantees that users can always sell their KLIMA for at least one tonne.\n\n'Burning' (destroying) would be the best way to truly retire the offsets, but would also mean the value of the Klima DAO treasury would be 0. As long as the treasury pool of carbon offsets is viewed as ‘backing,’ and if users can “always sell their KLIMA for at least one tonne”, then we’re not really talking about retirement here. The Klima DAO team has corroborated this themselves, stating in their server:\n\n> ...our treasury is designed to be one-way, at least for now - we hold the BCTs in reserve to back KLIMA issuance...there are a few scenarios where BCT could flow out of the treasury, most notably if KLIMA price fell below 1 BCT we would step in as buyer of last resort.\n\nIf Klima DAO had to sell BCT from the treasury to buy back KLIMA, what would stop another party from claiming these BCTs at a later date? These offsets still very much exist, just in a different form. At minimum, they should be accounted for differently in Verra’s registry. Further, to say Klima DAO is a ‘blackhole’ for offsets is inaccurate. Nothing can escape a blackhole once it crosses the event horizon; the gravitational pull of the black hole is too strong. With respect to Klima DAO, while I wrote earlier that the power of crypto market participants can be quasi-gravitational, it can also be quite ephemeral ⌛. BCTs can escape Klima DAO’s treasury again.\n\nThere are also challenges with how Klima DAO describes its aggregate impact. [@_boodle](https://twitter.com/_boodle), who kindly provided comments on this entire piece, wrote the following:\n\n> Klima DAO claims to have 8M tonnes of offsets in its treasury. At the time of writing, there were only 1.6M ‘pure’ BCTs in the treasury. The rest of the 8M consists of [‘liquidity pool](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/what-is-a-liquidity-pool-crypto-market-liquidity#:\\~:text=A%20liquidity%20pool%20is%20a,a%20decentralized%20exchange%20(DEX).)’ shares (“LP shares”), including shares in a KLIMA/BCT pool. These LP shares represent a credit for the underlying tokens in the pool (KLIMA and BCT for the KLIMA/BCT pool). As far as counting these offsets as captured though, these pools \\*exist\\* for people to trade against them. Let’s say that market participants decide that KLIMA is overvalued compared to BCT. LP share owners can draw on the KLIMA/BCT pool directly, depositing their KLIMA to pull out BCT at the current market rate. When that trade is made, the BCT that was counted towards the current 8M figure is pulled from the pool. This is an even more direct mechanism whereby BCT can exit Klima DAO.\n\nKlima DAO is more like a [cartel cornering a market](https://dirtroads.substack.com/p/-19-klima-a-family-story) or a dragon sleeping on a pile of gold 🐉. If you don’t fully retire offsets, the impact of hoarding them can reverse at a later date ⏪. If something happens to the dragon, you could see a flood of carbon offset supply coming back *onto* the market.\n\nIf the answer to why this *won’t* happen is that the price of KLIMA will continue to be above the value of the treasury, then that gives me pause too. Klima DAO’s systems obviously work well when the hype is on. But if the systems constantly require fresh capital to sustain themselves and to avoid releasing a bunch of BCTs back onto the market, then I start to wonder at what point it’d be better for investors to just buy the underlying BCTs and hold them themselves.\n\nI can of course see *why* burning hasn’t been implemented. KLIMA’s intrinsic value is its treasury of offsets, which it hopes will increase in value. That’s a huge part of their differentiation. If you burned all the offsets, you’d just have an inflationary token with staking rewards. There’s plenty of those in crypto.\n\n### Final thoughts 👋\n\nI had some reservations about saving “The Challenges” section for the back half of this piece. In the same way that it would be easy to appreciate the ambition of Klima DAO and the milestones they’ve achieved so far without digging deep on the mechanics, it would be easy to read the first half of this and conclude that I’m unequivocally bullish.\n\nWhat am I bullish on? I’m bullish on incentivizing emissions reduction, whether at the individual, corporate, country or global level. I’m bullish on incentivizing new carbon offset and removal projects and development of new technologies. And I’m bullish on democratizing access to new asset classes, carbon included.\n\nFor me to be bullish on Klima DAO as a project from a *climate* perspective, I’d like to see commitments for at least temporary ‘sequestration’ of the offsets they bring into their treasury. Could Klima DAO commit to a measure of minimum permanence; i.e. all offsets are locked in the treasury for a minimum of ten years, in the same way carbon offset projects themselves must prove to sequester carbon for minimum thresholds of time? It’d also be great to see the entire supply chain of offsets, from Verra to the treasury, audited by someone who understands carbon markets much better than I do.\n\nI’d also like to see the first wave of hype subside 🌊. The people who keep building after that will be the ones who address the challenges including and beyond those I’ve identified. Having spent a decent chunk of time in the #carbon-markets channel in Klima DAO’s Discord server, I have seen many folks who are active and understand carbon markets *much* more intimately then I do. I hope they stick around 🤞.\n\nMy broader hope is that Klima DAO is a battering ram for crypto x climate companies, applications, and protocols. There are many other projects (e.g. [Nori](https://nori.com/) and [Regen network](https://www.regen.network/)) [and DAOs](https://twitter.com/TheEdenDao) targeting the carbon market with crypto infrastructure that are following closely behind. If Klima DAO paves a path for them to garner attention, investment, and their own hype cycle? That’d be an achievement in and of itself 🌱.\n\nAnd if there are challenges that Klima DAO doesn’t deliberately and openly address? That will sour peoples’ perspective on future projects with adjacent missions. The first DAO ever [raised more than $100M… only to catastrophically fail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)). That set Ethereum back massively. The first crypto / climate protocol to hit a billion dollar market cap is naturally attracting a lot of attention. It has a lot riding on it 👀.

This means that, mainly, to make the management of resources as balanced as possible, we will have to normalize, limit and redistribute, for example, clothing, consumer products, food, housing and cars, among others. Indeed, all consumer goods that have to do with people’s daily lives! This could be confused a bit with Socialism and that in part it is. But it does not have to do, necessarily, with a philosophy or with a basic political idea or as with a political dogma.\n\nRather, it is related to the idea of ​​starting to consider that there are industries in which an excess supply and many options are not as relevant (or less necessary) and that, indeed, the current regulation of the industry will have to be revisited. Fashion and the food industry — by the way, 30% of agricultural land is used to grow food that will never be consumed and 21% of fresh water is discarded for its production, according to the FAO.\n\nAll of the above leads me to think that a roadmap is necessary to establish, define and specify the world production of what is strictly necessary for a good life. And that, in the virtual world, everything else happens.\n\n## We are replicas, of ourselves, at different levels of abstraction.\n\nIn the virtual world (Metaverse), that is, from our Avatar, we can satisfy our needs and consumer freedoms.\n\nHowever, in the physical world, and in light of everything we have been experiencing and everything that is happening in the world, mainly global warming, the pandemic and a number of other issues, I think standardization becomes totally necessary.\n\nCurrently, “natural” monopolies are already being generated such as Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, among others. These companies will be, in my opinion, those responsible for providing us with technology, consumer goods and social interactions, to inhabit this new standard physical world and populate the diverse virtual dimension.\n\n## Integrate and incorporate the virtual dimension.\n\nStarting today — figuratively — we must begin to integrate and incorporate the virtual world as one more dimension of our experience as human beings.\n\nThe grace of the sixties — in my opinion — is that it became evident, for some, that to evolve it was necessary to integrate the spiritual. A lot of teachings were unveiled that allowed us to create an ecosystem, to unleash the current rebellion of the virtual.\n\nAs a phenomenon, I feel like it’s the sixties of virtuality.\n\nToday, the revolution manifests and coordinates in “virtual” way!; a moment in humanity where we awaken to a new dimension, and therefore, to a new species of human being.", "timestamp": 1635892414, "digest": "wp-GMuc2Sl0scdPKUldP83bL2v26p0IBMsuzupzRk7M", "contributor": "0x44dDAa90Ba33409b07D4D94e80343B3861Ef9FfC"}

How come he could pick up some colourful and heavy things on the shelf and lock himself in the room for the whole day? I imitated his behaviour but hardly understood a word from his accounting, economy and management books.\n\nOne day, I browsed my Dad’s treasures and found one book rather fascinating. [The Life of Friedrich Nietzsche by Daniel Halévy](https://amzn.to/3ryLJv2) (The Chinese translation version of that book called Friedrich Nietzsche: I’m the Sun《尼采传：我是太阳》) triggered me because that’s the only few words I could recognise at the young age. I felt highly excited like Archimedes leapt out of the bath and rushed home naked crying, “Eureka! Eureka!” I thought I found the universal truth that the Sun is this beard and weird-looking guy!\n\nMy family made fun of me about how I secretly told everyone, “do you know the Sun has a name called Ni Cai (Nietzsche’s pronunciation in Chinese)?” and how I regarded myself as a detective scientist who decodes the identity of the Sun. Silly, right? That childhood mystery followed me for ages until I learnt at school what **metaphor** is and who the real Nietzsche is, and apparently, there is a conventional rule to name things in our society, including the Sun.\n\nMy old friend’ Nietzsche didn’t fade away with my stupidity but lingered around my life and led me to dig more about him and his fellow philosophers. As his saying goes, **he who has a why to live can bear almost any how**. Like many rebellious, moody and self-centred teenagers in my adolescent years, I blamed my parents for everything because “I didn’t choose to be born”. My early 20s also filled enormous pains from internal self-doubt and disturbing external facts. I didn't know why I was here and what's it for.​\n\nI wrote numerous suicide notes in my diaries but never made it into action. I suffered from a constant existential crisis but never fell into mental illness. I don’t know if I am a coward or a survivor in this life game.\n\nNow I want to share my journey of discovering my WHY (aka, my philosophy). They are my guiding principle for my short life on earth. I hope you will find yours and live life on your own terms. ​\n\n## Flowism ​\n\nMy life philosophy is Flowism, a term I made up when my best friend asked why I constantly change my mind and never settle down on one idea, a place, a job or a person. I said, “I go with a flow. I’m practising Flowism.”\n\nGoing with a flow doesn’t mean you are a fence-sitter or flip-flopper. It’s a state of following your intuition and evolving your thoughts and ideas constantly.\n\nIf the universe was an ocean, what we understand is only a drop of water. Nothing is certain. Nothing is for sure. Everything is impermanent.\n\nI am aware that I know nothing. I could explore everything with my intellectual curiosity where fate brings me. It's OK to change your mind regularly with the foundation of independent and rational thinking.\n\nThe reality is merely real. The concepts of time and space and cause and effect are an illusion. Who has the ability to define the objective truth based on our current understanding? Ask real questions and obtain a good explanation.\n\nAll things are neutral. Everything depends on our perspectives toward this world. We choose to fall into nihilism or decide to make everything meaningful to ourselves. If nothing matters, just have a fun journey and be like a cheerful nihilist.\n\nAll things, including people, come and go. Not forcing, not interfering, just accepting everything.\n\nLife is a single-player game with sufferings from desire, departure and detestation. Once you accept this setting, everything you encounter in your life will be more acceptable and enjoyable.\n\nThe meta meaning of living is existing. Existing is a pain. Once we go into a flow state of an egoless mind, everything will become nothing. I am nothing. Nothing is painful anymore.\n\nOur thoughts and ideas, or so-called free wills, are inextricably tied to language, and language is socially constructed. We are all socially conditioned.\n\nWhat I try to say here may sound different from what I mean, but it doesn’t matter. Just go with your flow; go with your understanding of flowism because others, including myself, are an illusion.\n\nLife is only making sense when you look back. So, go with flow forward and collect and connect dots on the way.\n\nRemember, all things come to those who flow the way, as all wild streams and all unruly torrents drive eventually to great rivers and the sea. ​\n\n## Life Principles ​\n\nBesides my life philosophy, I also summarise and update my life principles on my birthday every year ([29](https://www.camelliayang.com/blog/happy-birthday-29), [30](https://www.camelliayang.com/blog/30-thoughts-on-turning-30), [31](https://www.camelliayang.com/blog/31-thoughts-before-i-turn-31)) as my guide for living a truthful life.\n\n2020 is a memorable year for most people due to Covid 19. I had my first anniversary of moving to London and enjoyed most of the solitude time thanks to lockdown.\n\n​People have to spend a certain amount of time staying only with themselves to hear their inner voice. Only in this way can we have a clear understanding of who we are and what we can offer to this world.\n\nHere are my 32 principles on my 32 years old birthday:\n\n1\\. Roman emperor [Marcus Aurelius](https://amzn.to/3dnOZEn) once said: “You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think”. During the pandemic, we feel like illness and death are only one inch away from us. I rethink my life priority and let death serve as my warning alarm rather than a fearful monster. Once you dare to face death, you begin to live a truthful life.\n\n2\\. Logic is a human being’s creation. The universe doesn’t give a damn about that. We all try to figure out the correlation and causation and brag about the pattern we discovered. However, there are so many black swan events happening around us. Maybe possibility and randomness are the key messages we should bear in mind.\n\n3\\. Everyone has a default setting. Don’t follow what society and others expect you to do but listen to your inner voice. We all have unique DNA and life experiences. Rather than anything, pursue your truth.\n\n4\\. Nations, money and companies are all fiction concepts. When you choose to sacrifice your time and life for those ‘unreal’ subjects, think twice. Are they worthy of it?\n\n5\\. As a Chinese saying goes, one has to put knowledge into action. What you know is not that important until you unify the mind and action together. Any knowledge that you gain but not put into action was considered delusion or false.\n\n6\\. Direction ＞ speed. There is no point you driving so fast but in the wrong way. In order to get to your destination, in the end, you have to pause and double-check you are on the right track.\n\n7\\. I don’t know what I don’t know. Therefore, I have to be rationally open-minded all the time. Stay foolish and stay hungry. If three of us are walking together, at least one of the other two is good enough to be my teacher.\n\n8\\. Building a system is better than setting up a goal. A goal is temporary, but a system is a compound machine that can help you play a long-term game. I am what I repeat. Let your actions speak for your traits and identity.\n\n9\\. Amor Fati. Memento Mori.\n\n10\\. You always have a choice. Don’t let linear thinking and simple causation lead you to the end of the road. Open your eyes and seek possibilities around you.\n\n11\\. On one hand, loss implies gain; on the other hand, gain means loss. All things are neutral and based on our perspectives to decide it’s good or bad. Be positive and find the good side of things and people.\n\n12\\. Any relationship is a good relationship as long as we are a whole person rather than a person who has a hole to seek others to fill the gap. Life is a single-player game. Let’s appreciate everyone we met on the journey.\n\n13\\. When I take photos, I look around and find a perfect angle. Finding different angles can also apply to interpersonal communications. Don’t let misunderstandings or pre-set judgement affect the potential relationship you are about to build up with others.\n\n14\\. It’s human being, not human doing. Live in the moment.\n\n15\\. Always have a deadline. During the lockdown, I had the privilege to attend [James Altucher](https://jamesaltucher.com/) 30 days book challenge. I am always dreaming of writing a novel in English but never find a chance to sit my ass down and write. With this 30 days time frame, I finally completed my book! Doing is better than thinking and talking.\n\n16\\. There is no universal solution that can solve all your problems. Stop reading those self-help or success stories from others. Find the suffering that you enjoy the most, and keep moving forward.\n\n17\\. Creating content is a way to express my feelings and thoughts. It also heals my trauma and pains. Every time I create a character who suffers from the exact problems facing me, I can figure out a solution for her/him in a third person’s perspective.\n\n18\\. Be careful with others’ compliments, and then you won’t pay much attention to their criticism. Your ability has a benchmark and won’t change based on others’ thoughts. But be humble to take constructive feedback.\n\n19\\. As an ancient Buddha said, perceive as you see, believe not what you perceive, then accept what you know as they are. 「老僧三十年前未参禅时，见山是山，见水是水；及至后来，亲见知识，有个入处，见山不是山，见水不是水；而今得个休歇处，依前见山只是山，见水只是水」。\n\n20\\. [John Donne](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2XwDGxhR6fojwCAzt8Oyb3?si=dRipINY7RxuoV6BD6rDjQQ) wrote the poem, “No man is an island entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee”. Consider about others surrounding you and do something within your ability to help out.\n\n21\\. Learn to forgive. Everyone is on their journey. You don’t know what others are suffering. Be kind.\n\n22\\. Find someone who both of you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably share silence.\n\n23\\. [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/) mentioned the concept of ‘Emotional Diversity’. Clarify your emotions and know what triggered them. Don’t let emotions serve as your master, especially during the decision-making process.\n\n24\\. As [Kevin Kelly](https://kk.org/) said, the universe is conspiring behind your back to make you a success. Embrace this concept and accept the gift that the universe gives to you. Then share it with this world.\n\n25\\. You are not your emotions, your thoughts and your body. You are your actions and the feelings you bring to others.\n\n26\\. What we do every day will shape the future. When our bodies vanished, our cultural memes would live forever. We have to pay attention to our thoughts and actions to generate a promising future for the next generations.\n\n27\\. [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/) mentioned every city has its personalities and ambitions. Pick up your city carefully that won’t drag you back but help you to find your tribes. London is a perfect choice for me as a football and literature enthusiast.\n\n28\\. Create your daily routine that can generate compound interest, and repeat, repeat and repeat. As [Albert Camus](https://amzn.to/3mcYaeP) said, “the struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy”.\n\n29\\. A life without constant examination is not worth living. As [Naval](https://nav.al/) said, a proper examination should ruin the life that you’re currently living. There is nothing wrong with continuous changing your surroundings, your networkings and your lifestyles. People have different priorities in their life stages. Examine your focus and do not be afraid of change.\n\n30\\. Learn to surrender. Control what you can control and let things go with the flow of what they are supposed to be.\n\n31\\. “There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.” --Albert Einstein ​32. Life is only making sense when you look back. Collect and connect dots on the way.\n\n## Origins  ​\n\nI was born in Jinan, Shandong Province, China, where under the tremendous influence of **Confucianism** emphasised personal and governmental morality, the correctness of social relationships, justice, kindness, and sincerity. I was taught to respect and obey authorities and elders and sacrifice individual welfare to achieve a group goal.\n\nI was a Merit Student throughout primary school because I knew how to please others by studying hard and obeying all the rules. I remembered so vividly on the graduation day of primary school, my best friend Shixin told me, “You have such a beautiful pair of eyes, but I can’t find any happiness inside them. I wish you a happy life.”\n\nI was shocked, and then I cried.\n\nThat was the first time I realised I lived a pretentious life and never be a happy kid deep inside. All I did was oppress my free spirit to adapt to mainstream society to get approval from others. What’s it for? Why do I do that? What’s my purpose? Those self-examination questions lead me to so many depressing hours during my childhood.\n\nAs you might know, **Three Teachings** (Buddhism, Daoism and Confucianism) is a traditional belief system in China. Many Chinese families hike and worship those Buddha Statues at the top of the mountain, visit the Taoist temple to draw a fortune stick or go to Qu Fu to pray for Confucius for their children’s education. While my parents participating in those activities, I got my first personal computer to surf online to learn more about the stories behind those three schools of thought.\n\nThanks to my grandparents, Qi Kaimin and Sun Yuzhen, the survivors of the China Cultural Revolution, who were highly educated and cultured. They devoted their retiring life to researching **Yi Jing** (also known as I Ching or Book of Changes), a book by far being considered the most consulted of all books that believe it can explain everything.\n\nMy grandparents proposed changing my name from Chenlu to Yixuan to alter my fate based on what Yi Jing said. I had no idea why I changed so dramatically after the name change (puberty hormonal changes?). I started to behave in such a rebellious way, disobeyed authorities, wrote political-sensitive content, asked numerous questions on existence that drove my parents crazy. They thought it would be better to send me overseas rather than living in a traditional Chinese society that brought everybody in trouble.\n\nI joined the exchange student program and went to New Zealand to study. The language barriers and culture shock took me to another round of loneliness and depression. I came across a Baptist Church near my school and prayed for **Christian God** to save me from suffering. Meanwhile, I attended a campus counselling service and tried to cure myself based on psychological practice. I also found libraries and bookstores were my shelters where I could temporarily escape from reality and enjoy my alone time.\n\nAfter I moved from New Zealand to the UK, I got a chance to meet and talk with people from different cultures and backgrounds where I could learn Muslim, Orthodox and other schools of religions and philosophy that originated from this part hemisphere. I read from Greek saints to German philosophers, from ancient guru to contemporary thinkers, and then developed my philosophy by standing on those giants’ shoulders.\n\nHere is the list of names and schools that influenced my philosophy to my awareness:\n\n* Stoicism, Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism and Existentialism\n* Jean-Paul Sartre, Plato, Rene Descartes, Friedrich Nietzsche, Immanuel Kant, Soren Kierkegaard, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, David Deutsch, Jed McKenna, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, G.W.F. Hegel, Ayn Rand, Rick and Morty, [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/), [Ryan Holiday](https://ryanholiday.net/), [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/), [Naval](https://nav.al/), [Kapil](https://www.kapilguptamd.com/), Ludwig Wittgenstein, Jiddu Krishnamurti\n* Among hundreds of books I read, this is the list of the top books I recommend where I benefit a lot from those writers: <https://mostrecommendedbooks.com/user/camelliayang>\n\n​\n\n## Tibet Trip ​\n\nIn 2015, I quit my first full-time job at a well-known New Zealand company because I lost my motivation and inspiration as a content creator. I went to America and indulged myself in materialistic pleasure. It was a fun month, but this kind of action provided me with a temporary solution rather than a permanent cure.\n\nI fell into a void and emptiness.\n\nBack then, my Dad made his trip to Tibet and shared photos of those majestic palaces and magical natural scenery with me. I have always been fascinated by **Tibetan Buddhism** and the profoundness of Tibetan culture. Since I was a child, I heard Princess Wencheng entering Tibet and marrying Songtsen Gampo and the story of how Tibetan used human skin to make drums.\n\nI longed for this sacred and mysterious land, and it was time for me to pay for a visit.\n\nIt took me 24 hours by train to arrive in Lhasa, Tibet. I went through horrible altitude sickness (headache and accelerated heartbeat plus breathing difficulty), but the grand scenery along the way made me survive this mammoth trip.\n\nI visited many villages where I saw the national five-star red flag flying in almost every house. I had no idea if it’s the government’s efforts or Tibetans voluntarily did so. My journalist background drove me to talk with everyone I met, but many elder villages could not speak Mandarin. Although we could not communicate, their genuine and innocent smiles made me feel very comfortable.\n\nWhat impressed me most was the Tibetan Buddhism Prostration. Tibetan Buddhism believers prostrate themselves on the ground, with the head, arms, and knees down on the ground, and move forward slowly, following every step with a kowtow. This was the way to express their most honest hearts to the Buddha, as they walked from their hometown to Lhasa, one kowtow with every three steps they took until they arrived in Lhasa (usually took a couple of months with 100,000 kowtows!).\n\nI was shocked because I never saw hundreds of people prostrating this ritual along the way. What made them so devoted? What’s the purpose for them to do so? What would they want to achieve?\n\nReflecting on my life, I had never focused on one thing, not to mention committed to any practice like that. I talked with the locals and prostrators and learnt that Buddha said our world is an illusion. **Human beings can strip themselves of this illusion through meditation and self-denial to achieve enlightenment**. The prostration practice is essential to the mind’s purification and freeing it from lousy karma due to harmful doings or thoughts.\n\nAlthough I’ve read a couple of Buddhism books before and had an idea of the Tibetan prostrator. Words on paper could not compare with seeing them practising at the Dazhao Temple in front of me! I was so touched by their actions and devotion. Moreover, visiting Dazhao Temple made me emerge the hope to our human race.\n\nThe Dazhao Temple owns its fame to its life-sized statue of the Buddha at age 12, brought to Lhasa as part of the Chinese Princess Wencheng’s dowry in 641.  1000 years later, another notable event happened in the temple’s long history: Chinese Emperor Kangxi’s visited here as a part of governing inspection.\n\nHow glad to see different ethnic groups could live harmoniously in one land throughout history. Although conflicts and wars had happened occasionally, the mixed ethnic culture memes would find their way to survive and left essences to the future generation.\n\nOne of the highlights of my Tibet trip was visiting the Potala Palace. Songtsen Gampo built this world wonder to marry Princess Wencheng from mainland China over 1,300 years ago. The Potala Palace was built on top of the mountain with more than 2,000 rooms full of paintings, books and exotic treasures.\n\nThe whole trip was mind-blowing with awe. Although human beings only existed in this universe for such a short period, the hard labour of creating those fantastic buildings and arts have always made me so emotional. ​​According to Tibetan Buddhist culture, if you circumambulate Mount Kailash clockwise on foot in the Year of Horse, it will bring good fortune because Mount Kailash is considered a home of Buddha Cakrasaṃvar, who represents supreme bliss; If you walk around Lake Namtso clockwise on foot in the Year of Sheep, it will bring buddha’ blessings because Lake Namtso is the holy lake in the Tibetan world.\n\n​The sixth Dalai Lama, Cang Yang Gyatso, once wrote a poem about his experiences walking around the mountain and the lake, “In this lifetime, circumambulating the mountains, the lake and stupas but not to seek rebirth, only to meet you along the way”. How romantic!\n\nI also wrote a piece to this beautiful land that blessed me with her beauty and holiness.\n\n告别西藏，难忘那白云朵朵蓝色静谧的天空，难忘那浪花淘淘绿色磅礴的江水，难忘那蓝白红绿黄代表天地五行的经幡，难忘那东西南北中虔诚扣头敬拜的教徒。\n\n布达拉宫依旧在旭日的照耀下璀璨生辉，藏香袅袅，佛音阵阵，美好一天又轮回，我在告别，你在守候，何日我们再相会？\n\nFarewell to Tibet, The Potala Palace shining brightly under the rising Sun.Farewell with the prayer flags with five pure lights.\n\nFarewell to Tibet, The Tibetan incense is curling up, Farewell to its white clouds, blue sky, and colourful lands.\n\nFarewell to Tibet, The Buddhist chanting is bursting out, Farewell to devoted people from the bottom of my heart.\n\nA beautiful day has come and gone. I’m saying goodbye. You are staying hereby. We are fated to meet again, Between the dark and dawn.​\n\n## Meditation Journey ​\n\nIf you’ve never tried it before, meditation can seem both improbable and pointless. You might wonder what the point is of sitting quietly for twenty minutes. It looks like a waste of time that doesn’t have any tangible benefits! But countless people and books talk about how important meditation is for your health, so I wondered: shall I give it a go and see what would work for me?\n\nIn 2018, after researching many different ways of meditation, I signed up for a **Transcendental Meditation (TM)** course, primarily influenced by [Ray Dalio](https://amzn.to/3drr07c), whose Principles was one of my favourite books. In this six-week course, my teacher taught me a mantra (he said everyone’s mantra is different. The mantra itself is meaningless, and it’s just an anchoring tool to help you focus). All I have to do is practice meditation for 20 minutes twice a day, once after waking up in the morning and once before dinner, in any setting or comfortable position.\n\n### How do I practise?\n\nFirst, choose a comfortable position, either sitting cross-legged or on a chair or sofa, as long as you are not lying down. Second, close your eyes and sit still for half a minute to a minute. When you feel relaxed, start repeating your mantra in your head. Your brain will generate many mixed thoughts at this time. The ideal state is when the mantra and the thoughts cease to exist, and a feeling of emptiness is achieved.\n\nAs it is written in the biography of [Steve Jobs,](https://amzn.to/3m8slUw) *“If you just sit and observe, you will see how restless your mind is. If you try to calm it, it only makes things worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there’s room to hear more subtle things — that’s when your intuition starts to blossom, and you start to see things more clearly and be in the present more. Your mind just slows down, and you see a tremendous expanse at the moment. You see so much more than you could see before. It’s a discipline; you have to practice it.”* I totally agree. The important part is **not controlling your thoughts but letting them go without interruption.**\n\nIt takes time but is worth it.\n\n### Yoga and Meditation Retreats\n\nOnce a year, I took a couple of weeks to do a **Yoga or Meditation retreat**. In 2019, I joined the Blooming Lotus Yoga retreat in Bali, including daily morning and evening yoga classes, theoretical study of the yoga system, daily morning and evening meditation sessions, and Bali’s cultural tour.\n\nAs an amateur CrossFit girl, I always find yoga too soothing and soft. I prefer to pump and punch in the gym or go to a HIIT class, making me feel like exercising. This seven-day intensive yoga training has changed my perspective on yoga classes in a fundamental way. I had a chance to learn Yin and Yang yoga. One is slightly faster, fluid, energetic and powerful; the other is softer, focusing on stretching and emphasising the endurance to achieve a state of unity between body and mind.\n\nYoga is not just a form of exercise but a way of life that unites body, mind and spirit, dating back 5,000 years to the Indus Valley. It has evolved over the millennia into many schools of thought, from the classical five major systems (wisdom yoga, karma yoga, hatha yoga, king yoga, kundalini yoga) and the eight branches of practice (abstinence, practice, asana, pranayama, mindfulness, concentration, meditation and samadhi) to the countless variations in modern society (hot yoga, Iyengar yoga, etc.).\n\nThe instructor briefly introduced us to Yoga Nidra, Chakras, Ayurveda and the yogic philosophy of ‘Unity of the Self’, and highlighted how to apply this theoretical knowledge to practical life by adopting healthy eating and exercise habits, self-healing and achieving a state of inner peace through a series of daily rituals. The most exciting part for me was the sister of Yoga: Ayurveda, derived from the Sanskrit word ‘life science’ with 5,000 years of history (Chinese medicine is also derived from Ayurveda).\n\nAyurveda believes that everything in the universe is made up of the five elements: Air (Akash), Wind (Vayu), Earth (Prithvi), Fire (Tejas) and Water (Apa), and the same is true of the human body (the five elements of Chinese medicine). These five elements are mixed to form Doshas’s life energy and are divided into three main categories.\n\nVata = Air + Wind\n\nPitta = Fire + Water\n\nKapha = Earth + Water\n\nThe Ayurvedic system teaches people to look within, understand themselves from the inside out, and find out what makes ‘themselves’. The essence of Ayurveda is to **find, discover and regulate your own sense of balance, to live in harmony with yourself, with others and with everything in the world.** No one can give more than what they have, which is why you must first start loving yourself. Be less obsessive with perfectionism and focus more on caring for yourself.\n\nThe most noticeable change since I started meditating is that I have become more aware of my ‘thoughts’ and many things I thought I had forgotten. Also, the emotions I had previously hidden and suppressed have come out (it can be horrifying at the beginning few months of practising meditation because you have to confront those ugly things that you avoided before).\n\n[Sigmund Freud](https://amzn.to/3rDamqn) once said, **“unexpressed emotions will never die. They are buried alive and will come forth later in uglier ways.”** No wonder I went through a couple of panic attacks in the past years --- my repressed emotions eventually reached their breaking point and suddenly attacked me.\n\nWith the help of meditation, I have more courage to face these deeply buried thoughts and feelings, which, although painful, are temporary, and when they are resolved one by one, I will no longer be disturbed by them and will have a clear-thinking mind.\n\nMeditation, like most things, is a long-term process, and just as the body needs to keep exercising to build muscle, the brain needs to keep meditating to develop awareness. Once you can be aware of yourself rather than follow the crowd, you’ll better understand who you really are and what you really want. And once this fundamental problem has been solved, other secondary issues that arise from a lack of clarity about ‘who you are’ will cease to exist.\n\n### Digital Detox Retreat\n\nDue to my work’s nature, I am always on my phone or in front of my computer, swiping through various social media platforms at all times, and actively/passively receiving a lot of fragmented information. Because of the fragmented knowledge in my head, I cannot focus and am easily affected by all kinds of redundant and cluttered information whenever I am thinking about complex issues. I constantly feel tired and less productive.\n\nIn 2018, I got a chance to check out a digital detox retreat in Auckland. It’s an excellent excuse for me to get away from the screen, be alone with myself and reflect on myself. In those three days, I didn’t touch any of my electronic devices. Each morning, I woke up naturally and practised two full meditation sessions, including 10-15 minutes of yoga, 5 minutes of breathing exercises, 20 minutes of Transcendental Meditation, resting in bed for the last 10 minutes and then repeating the above set of movements.\n\nThe rest of the day was writing journals, reading books, going out, and talking with other participants. I remembered one day I was sitting on my balcony and meditating. The Sun was shining brightly before I closed my eyes. When I woke up from the half-hour-long meditation, it was drizzling outside, and a little bird standing on my balcony, singing freely.\n\nIt reminds me of the time I watched the movie *Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.* The heroine saw a deer strolling on the green grass under the billboard, with the sunray in the backdrop. The heroine could not help but talk to the deer about her love for her daughter, and she returned to nature and faced the soft part of her heart. I shared the same feeling, appreciating nature’s beauty with gratitude.​\n\n## Psychedelic Experience\n\nIn 2021, I had my first psychedelic experience with the Grandfather plant, San Pedro, at [The Lighthouse Retreat](https://lighthouseretreats.co.uk/).\n\n2 trips in 4 days let me ‘saw’ the themes constantly haunted my mind: **time, space, reality and dream**. We all know language could be limited when you try to describe something overpowering magnificent. Here is my attempt to describe those visions and insights:​\n\nEighty-four thousand thoughts and ideas,\n\nLandscape transformation in the whirligig of time,\n\nEverything is evolving and decaying in front of my eyes.​\n\nVivid Colours dancing along with the music of nature,\n\nInfinite fractals emerging and disappearing like the Mandelbrot set and Mandala of Sanskrit.\n\nVan Gogh’s painting in a tangible form.​\n\nRam Dass’s message comes into my mind,\n\n“We’re all just walking each other home”.\n\nWe are nameless and formless,\n\nWe are a pixel and we are a Buddha,\n\nWas vernünftig ist, das ist wirklich,\n\nWe’re loved just for being who we are, just for existing.​\n\nLet’s accept ourselves and others in full,\n\nTry not to control, try not to force, try to surrender to the power of the universe.\n\nTime and space are a total illusion.\n\nThe reality doesn’t seem like what we see.\n\nTo see beauty, use our heart, not our eyes.\n\nFeel, and we shall know.\n\nSeek, and we shall find.​\n\nI rise above the earth and travel through abstract concepts and patterns.\n\nA snap of the finger is the moment of eternity.\n\nI could have lived forever in that dazzling and wonderful dream,\n\nBut your sweet smile pulls me back to the material world.​\n\nRemember, remember,\n\nLife is the eighth wonder.\n\nWhen we genuinely want something,\n\nThe whole universe is always on our side.\n\n​P.S. My teacher Isher at the retreat centre gave me the nickname “Zen Master” because I could sit on the platform for hours, calm and still. He mentioned my peaceful energy would help to balance unstable emotions from others.\n\nApart from the above experience, I do fully echo with what Steve Jobs once said, “*You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future”.*\n\nEverything that happened in my life has already connected in a beautiful circle. What I need to do is just follow my intuition and walk through the journey with love. Thanks to Grandpa San Pedro! See you soon, Grandma Ayahuasca!​\n\nP.P.S. I was astonished when I found Mandala flowers at the retreat centre! When I studied Buddhism at an early age, I named myself Mandala, and after two decades, I finally met ‘myself’ again.\n\n## Ultimate Goal  ​\n\nLast but not least, my grandpa left a poem to my family before dying in 2009.\n\nHe was a lifelong learner and independent thinker with intellectual curiosity on many subjects. Although he went through numerous ups and downs in his lifetime, he chose to have an innocent heart with a peaceful mind.\n\nI hope one day I could reach the same level as what he called oneness between me and the universe.​​\n\n![My grandpa Qi Kaimin's poem](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JYi1VRrCbImDdpKHVTlal.jpeg?height=827&width=639)\n\n《静坐吟》\n\n流光荏苒去无踪，\n\n富贵如云过眼空。\n\n淡泊生涯游物外，\n\n超然世俗学禅宗。\n\n阴阳和化情缘净，\n\n动静参修性意通。\n\n精气相乘神内守，\n\n天人合一九霄中。 ​​​​\n\n​Meditation\n\nThe light of the day is gone without a trace,\n\nWealth and fame are like clouds passing by.\n\nI am a simple person living a life outside of the material world,\n\nAnd I have studied Zen from the journey within.\n\nYin and Yang harmonise and purify my emotions, \n\nMoving and meditating cultivated my mind.\n\nThe essence of the spirit is my inner guard,\n\nThe universe and I unified in one.\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=295](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=295)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635894971, "digest": "goEs88Y0eo6SuQ1fp8TCQLMFI7X7HICINBtS_zYiH2o", "contributor": "0x6902E5CAf41158d3eD516cBd6D2807BB63863F42"}

How come he could pick up some colourful and heavy things on the shelf and lock himself in the room for the whole day? I imitated his behaviour but hardly understood a word from his accounting, economy and management books.\n\nOne day, I browsed my Dad’s treasures and found one book rather fascinating. [The Life of Friedrich Nietzsche by Daniel Halévy](https://amzn.to/3ryLJv2) (The Chinese translation version of that book called Friedrich Nietzsche: I’m the Sun《尼采传：我是太阳》) triggered me because that’s the only few words I could recognise at the young age. I felt highly excited like Archimedes leapt out of the bath and rushed home naked crying, “Eureka! Eureka!” I thought I found the universal truth that the Sun is this beard and weird-looking guy!\n\nMy family made fun of me about how I secretly told everyone, “do you know the Sun has a name called Ni Cai (Nietzsche’s pronunciation in Chinese)?” and how I regarded myself as a detective scientist who decodes the identity of the Sun. Silly, right? That childhood mystery followed me for ages until I learnt at school what **metaphor** is and who the real Nietzsche is, and apparently, there is a conventional rule to name things in our society, including the Sun.\n\nMy old friend’ Nietzsche didn’t fade away with my stupidity but lingered around my life and led me to dig more about him and his fellow philosophers. As his saying goes, **he who has a why to live can bear almost any how**. Like many rebellious, moody and self-centred teenagers in my adolescent years, I blamed my parents for everything because “I didn’t choose to be born”. My early 20s also filled enormous pains from internal self-doubt and disturbing external facts. I didn't know why I was here and what's it for.​\n\nI wrote numerous suicide notes in my diaries but never made it into action. I suffered from a constant existential crisis but never fell into mental illness. I don’t know if I am a coward or a survivor in this life game.\n\nNow I want to share my journey of discovering my WHY (aka, my philosophy). They are my guiding principle for my short life on earth. I hope you will find yours and live life on your own terms. ​\n\n## Flowism ​\n\nMy life philosophy is Flowism, a term I made up when my best friend asked why I constantly change my mind and never settle down on one idea, a place, a job or a person. I said, “I go with a flow. I’m practising Flowism.”\n\nGoing with a flow doesn’t mean you are a fence-sitter or flip-flopper. It’s a state of following your intuition and evolving your thoughts and ideas constantly.\n\nIf the universe was an ocean, what we understand is only a drop of water. Nothing is certain. Nothing is for sure. Everything is impermanent.\n\nI am aware that I know nothing. I could explore everything with my intellectual curiosity where fate brings me. It's OK to change your mind regularly with the foundation of independent and rational thinking.\n\nThe reality is merely real. The concepts of time and space and cause and effect are an illusion. Who has the ability to define the objective truth based on our current understanding? Ask real questions and obtain a good explanation.\n\nAll things are neutral. Everything depends on our perspectives toward this world. We choose to fall into nihilism or decide to make everything meaningful to ourselves. If nothing matters, just have a fun journey and be like a cheerful nihilist.\n\nAll things, including people, come and go. Not forcing, not interfering, just accepting everything.\n\nLife is a single-player game with sufferings from desire, departure and detestation. Once you accept this setting, everything you encounter in your life will be more acceptable and enjoyable.\n\nThe meta meaning of living is existing. Existing is a pain. Once we go into a flow state of an egoless mind, everything will become nothing. I am nothing. Nothing is painful anymore.\n\nOur thoughts and ideas, or so-called free wills, are inextricably tied to language, and language is socially constructed. We are all socially conditioned.\n\nWhat I try to say here may sound different from what I mean, but it doesn’t matter. Just go with your flow; go with your understanding of flowism because others, including myself, are an illusion.\n\nLife is only making sense when you look back. So, go with flow forward and collect and connect dots on the way.\n\nRemember, all things come to those who flow the way, as all wild streams and all unruly torrents drive eventually to great rivers and the sea. ​\n\n## Life Principles ​\n\nBesides my life philosophy, I also summarise and update my life principles on my birthday every year ([29](https://www.camelliayang.com/blog/happy-birthday-29), [30](https://www.camelliayang.com/blog/30-thoughts-on-turning-30), [31](https://www.camelliayang.com/blog/31-thoughts-before-i-turn-31)) as my guide for living a truthful life.\n\n2020 is a memorable year for most people due to Covid 19. I had my first anniversary of moving to London and enjoyed most of the solitude time thanks to lockdown.\n\n​People have to spend a certain amount of time staying only with themselves to hear their inner voice. Only in this way can we have a clear understanding of who we are and what we can offer to this world.\n\nHere are my 32 principles on my 32 years old birthday:\n\n1\\. Roman emperor [Marcus Aurelius](https://amzn.to/3dnOZEn) once said: “You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think”. During the pandemic, we feel like illness and death are only one inch away from us. I rethink my life priority and let death serve as my warning alarm rather than a fearful monster. Once you dare to face death, you begin to live a truthful life.\n\n2\\. Logic is a human being’s creation. The universe doesn’t give a damn about that. We all try to figure out the correlation and causation and brag about the pattern we discovered. However, there are so many black swan events happening around us. Maybe possibility and randomness are the key messages we should bear in mind.\n\n3\\. Everyone has a default setting. Don’t follow what society and others expect you to do but listen to your inner voice. We all have unique DNA and life experiences. Rather than anything, pursue your truth.\n\n4\\. Nations, money and companies are all fiction concepts. When you choose to sacrifice your time and life for those ‘unreal’ subjects, think twice. Are they worthy of it?\n\n5\\. As a Chinese saying goes, one has to put knowledge into action. What you know is not that important until you unify the mind and action together. Any knowledge that you gain but not put into action was considered delusion or false.\n\n6\\. Direction ＞ speed. There is no point you driving so fast but in the wrong way. In order to get to your destination, in the end, you have to pause and double-check you are on the right track.\n\n7\\. I don’t know what I don’t know. Therefore, I have to be rationally open-minded all the time. Stay foolish and stay hungry. If three of us are walking together, at least one of the other two is good enough to be my teacher.\n\n8\\. Building a system is better than setting up a goal. A goal is temporary, but a system is a compound machine that can help you play a long-term game. I am what I repeat. Let your actions speak for your traits and identity.\n\n9\\. Amor Fati. Memento Mori.\n\n10\\. You always have a choice. Don’t let linear thinking and simple causation lead you to the end of the road. Open your eyes and seek possibilities around you.\n\n11\\. On one hand, loss implies gain; on the other hand, gain means loss. All things are neutral and based on our perspectives to decide it’s good or bad. Be positive and find the good side of things and people.\n\n12\\. Any relationship is a good relationship as long as we are a whole person rather than a person who has a hole to seek others to fill the gap. Life is a single-player game. Let’s appreciate everyone we met on the journey.\n\n13\\. When I take photos, I look around and find a perfect angle. Finding different angles can also apply to interpersonal communications. Don’t let misunderstandings or pre-set judgement affect the potential relationship you are about to build up with others.\n\n14\\. It’s human being, not human doing. Live in the moment.\n\n15\\. Always have a deadline. During the lockdown, I had the privilege to attend [James Altucher](https://jamesaltucher.com/) 30 days book challenge. I am always dreaming of writing a novel in English but never find a chance to sit my ass down and write. With this 30 days time frame, I finally completed my book! Doing is better than thinking and talking.\n\n16\\. There is no universal solution that can solve all your problems. Stop reading those self-help or success stories from others. Find the suffering that you enjoy the most, and keep moving forward.\n\n17\\. Creating content is a way to express my feelings and thoughts. It also heals my trauma and pains. Every time I create a character who suffers from the exact problems facing me, I can figure out a solution for her/him in a third person’s perspective.\n\n18\\. Be careful with others’ compliments, and then you won’t pay much attention to their criticism. Your ability has a benchmark and won’t change based on others’ thoughts. But be humble to take constructive feedback.\n\n19\\. As an ancient Buddha said, perceive as you see, believe not what you perceive, then accept what you know as they are. 「老僧三十年前未参禅时，见山是山，见水是水；及至后来，亲见知识，有个入处，见山不是山，见水不是水；而今得个休歇处，依前见山只是山，见水只是水」。\n\n20\\. [John Donne](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2XwDGxhR6fojwCAzt8Oyb3?si=dRipINY7RxuoV6BD6rDjQQ) wrote the poem, “No man is an island entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee”. Consider about others surrounding you and do something within your ability to help out.\n\n21\\. Learn to forgive. Everyone is on their journey. You don’t know what others are suffering. Be kind.\n\n22\\. Find someone who both of you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably share silence.\n\n23\\. [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/) mentioned the concept of ‘Emotional Diversity’. Clarify your emotions and know what triggered them. Don’t let emotions serve as your master, especially during the decision-making process.\n\n24\\. As [Kevin Kelly](https://kk.org/) said, the universe is conspiring behind your back to make you a success. Embrace this concept and accept the gift that the universe gives to you. Then share it with this world.\n\n25\\. You are not your emotions, your thoughts and your body. You are your actions and the feelings you bring to others.\n\n26\\. What we do every day will shape the future. When our bodies vanished, our cultural memes would live forever. We have to pay attention to our thoughts and actions to generate a promising future for the next generations.\n\n27\\. [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/) mentioned every city has its personalities and ambitions. Pick up your city carefully that won’t drag you back but help you to find your tribes. London is a perfect choice for me as a football and literature enthusiast.\n\n28\\. Create your daily routine that can generate compound interest, and repeat, repeat and repeat. As [Albert Camus](https://amzn.to/3mcYaeP) said, “the struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy”.\n\n29\\. A life without constant examination is not worth living. As [Naval](https://nav.al/) said, a proper examination should ruin the life that you’re currently living. There is nothing wrong with continuous changing your surroundings, your networkings and your lifestyles. People have different priorities in their life stages. Examine your focus and do not be afraid of change.\n\n30\\. Learn to surrender. Control what you can control and let things go with the flow of what they are supposed to be.\n\n31\\. “There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.” --Albert Einstein ​32. Life is only making sense when you look back. Collect and connect dots on the way.\n\n## Origins  ​\n\nI was born in Jinan, Shandong Province, China, where under the tremendous influence of **Confucianism** emphasised personal and governmental morality, the correctness of social relationships, justice, kindness, and sincerity. I was taught to respect and obey authorities and elders and sacrifice individual welfare to achieve a group goal.\n\nI was a Merit Student throughout primary school because I knew how to please others by studying hard and obeying all the rules. I remembered so vividly on the graduation day of primary school, my best friend Shixin told me, “You have such a beautiful pair of eyes, but I can’t find any happiness inside them. I wish you a happy life.”\n\nI was shocked, and then I cried.\n\nThat was the first time I realised I lived a pretentious life and never be a happy kid deep inside. All I did was oppress my free spirit to adapt to mainstream society to get approval from others. What’s it for? Why do I do that? What’s my purpose? Those self-examination questions lead me to so many depressing hours during my childhood.\n\nAs you might know, **Three Teachings** (Buddhism, Daoism and Confucianism) is a traditional belief system in China. Many Chinese families hike and worship those Buddha Statues at the top of the mountain, visit the Taoist temple to draw a fortune stick or go to Qu Fu to pray for Confucius for their children’s education. While my parents participating in those activities, I got my first personal computer to surf online to learn more about the stories behind those three schools of thought.\n\nThanks to my grandparents, Qi Kaimin and Sun Yuzhen, the survivors of the China Cultural Revolution, who were highly educated and cultured. They devoted their retiring life to researching **Yi Jing** (also known as I Ching or Book of Changes), a book by far being considered the most consulted of all books that believe it can explain everything.\n\nMy grandparents proposed changing my name from Chenlu to Yixuan to alter my fate based on what Yi Jing said. I had no idea why I changed so dramatically after the name change (puberty hormonal changes?). I started to behave in such a rebellious way, disobeyed authorities, wrote political-sensitive content, asked numerous questions on existence that drove my parents crazy. They thought it would be better to send me overseas rather than living in a traditional Chinese society that brought everybody in trouble.\n\nI joined the exchange student program and went to New Zealand to study. The language barriers and culture shock took me to another round of loneliness and depression. I came across a Baptist Church near my school and prayed for **Christian God** to save me from suffering. Meanwhile, I attended a campus counselling service and tried to cure myself based on psychological practice. I also found libraries and bookstores were my shelters where I could temporarily escape from reality and enjoy my alone time.\n\nAfter I moved from New Zealand to the UK, I got a chance to meet and talk with people from different cultures and backgrounds where I could learn Muslim, Orthodox and other schools of religions and philosophy that originated from this part hemisphere. I read from Greek saints to German philosophers, from ancient guru to contemporary thinkers, and then developed my philosophy by standing on those giants’ shoulders.\n\nHere is the list of names and schools that influenced my philosophy to my awareness:\n\n* Stoicism, Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism and Existentialism\n* Jean-Paul Sartre, Plato, Rene Descartes, Friedrich Nietzsche, Immanuel Kant, Soren Kierkegaard, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, David Deutsch, Jed McKenna, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, G.W.F. Hegel, Ayn Rand, Rick and Morty, [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/), [Ryan Holiday](https://ryanholiday.net/), [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/), [Naval](https://nav.al/), [Kapil](https://www.kapilguptamd.com/), Ludwig Wittgenstein, Jiddu Krishnamurti\n* Among hundreds of books I read, this is the list of the top books I recommend where I benefit a lot from those writers: <https://mostrecommendedbooks.com/user/camelliayang>\n\n​\n\n## Tibet Trip ​\n\nIn 2015, I quit my first full-time job at a well-known New Zealand company because I lost my motivation and inspiration as a content creator. I went to America and indulged myself in materialistic pleasure. It was a fun month, but this kind of action provided me with a temporary solution rather than a permanent cure.\n\nI fell into a void and emptiness.\n\nBack then, my Dad made his trip to Tibet and shared photos of those majestic palaces and magical natural scenery with me. I have always been fascinated by **Tibetan Buddhism** and the profoundness of Tibetan culture. Since I was a child, I heard Princess Wencheng entering Tibet and marrying Songtsen Gampo and the story of how Tibetan used human skin to make drums.\n\nI longed for this sacred and mysterious land, and it was time for me to pay for a visit.\n\nIt took me 24 hours by train to arrive in Lhasa, Tibet. I went through horrible altitude sickness (headache and accelerated heartbeat plus breathing difficulty), but the grand scenery along the way made me survive this mammoth trip.\n\nI visited many villages where I saw the national five-star red flag flying in almost every house. I had no idea if it’s the government’s efforts or Tibetans voluntarily did so. My journalist background drove me to talk with everyone I met, but many elder villages could not speak Mandarin. Although we could not communicate, their genuine and innocent smiles made me feel very comfortable.\n\nWhat impressed me most was the Tibetan Buddhism Prostration. Tibetan Buddhism believers prostrate themselves on the ground, with the head, arms, and knees down on the ground, and move forward slowly, following every step with a kowtow. This was the way to express their most honest hearts to the Buddha, as they walked from their hometown to Lhasa, one kowtow with every three steps they took until they arrived in Lhasa (usually took a couple of months with 100,000 kowtows!).\n\nI was shocked because I never saw hundreds of people prostrating this ritual along the way. What made them so devoted? What’s the purpose for them to do so? What would they want to achieve?\n\nReflecting on my life, I had never focused on one thing, not to mention committed to any practice like that. I talked with the locals and prostrators and learnt that Buddha said our world is an illusion. **Human beings can strip themselves of this illusion through meditation and self-denial to achieve enlightenment**. The prostration practice is essential to the mind’s purification and freeing it from lousy karma due to harmful doings or thoughts.\n\nAlthough I’ve read a couple of Buddhism books before and had an idea of the Tibetan prostrator. Words on paper could not compare with seeing them practising at the Dazhao Temple in front of me! I was so touched by their actions and devotion. Moreover, visiting Dazhao Temple made me emerge the hope to our human race.\n\nThe Dazhao Temple owns its fame to its life-sized statue of the Buddha at age 12, brought to Lhasa as part of the Chinese Princess Wencheng’s dowry in 641.  1000 years later, another notable event happened in the temple’s long history: Chinese Emperor Kangxi’s visited here as a part of governing inspection.\n\nHow glad to see different ethnic groups could live harmoniously in one land throughout history. Although conflicts and wars had happened occasionally, the mixed ethnic culture memes would find their way to survive and left essences to the future generation.\n\nOne of the highlights of my Tibet trip was visiting the Potala Palace. Songtsen Gampo built this world wonder to marry Princess Wencheng from mainland China over 1,300 years ago. The Potala Palace was built on top of the mountain with more than 2,000 rooms full of paintings, books and exotic treasures.\n\nThe whole trip was mind-blowing with awe. Although human beings only existed in this universe for such a short period, the hard labour of creating those fantastic buildings and arts have always made me so emotional. ​​According to Tibetan Buddhist culture, if you circumambulate Mount Kailash clockwise on foot in the Year of Horse, it will bring good fortune because Mount Kailash is considered a home of Buddha Cakrasaṃvar, who represents supreme bliss; If you walk around Lake Namtso clockwise on foot in the Year of Sheep, it will bring buddha’ blessings because Lake Namtso is the holy lake in the Tibetan world.\n\n​The sixth Dalai Lama, Cang Yang Gyatso, once wrote a poem about his experiences walking around the mountain and the lake, “In this lifetime, circumambulating the mountains, the lake and stupas but not to seek rebirth, only to meet you along the way”. How romantic!\n\nI also wrote a piece to this beautiful land that blessed me with her beauty and holiness.\n\n告别西藏，难忘那白云朵朵蓝色静谧的天空，难忘那浪花淘淘绿色磅礴的江水，难忘那蓝白红绿黄代表天地五行的经幡，难忘那东西南北中虔诚扣头敬拜的教徒。\n\n布达拉宫依旧在旭日的照耀下璀璨生辉，藏香袅袅，佛音阵阵，美好一天又轮回，我在告别，你在守候，何日我们再相会？\n\nFarewell to Tibet, The Potala Palace shining brightly under the rising Sun.Farewell with the prayer flags with five pure lights.\n\nFarewell to Tibet, The Tibetan incense is curling up, Farewell to its white clouds, blue sky, and colourful lands.\n\nFarewell to Tibet, The Buddhist chanting is bursting out, Farewell to devoted people from the bottom of my heart.\n\nA beautiful day has come and gone. I’m saying goodbye. You are staying hereby. We are fated to meet again, Between the dark and dawn.​\n\n## Meditation Journey ​\n\nIf you’ve never tried it before, meditation can seem both improbable and pointless. You might wonder what the point is of sitting quietly for twenty minutes. It looks like a waste of time that doesn’t have any tangible benefits! But countless people and books talk about how important meditation is for your health, so I wondered: shall I give it a go and see what would work for me?\n\nIn 2018, after researching many different ways of meditation, I signed up for a **Transcendental Meditation (TM)** course, primarily influenced by [Ray Dalio](https://amzn.to/3drr07c), whose Principles was one of my favourite books. In this six-week course, my teacher taught me a mantra (he said everyone’s mantra is different. The mantra itself is meaningless, and it’s just an anchoring tool to help you focus). All I have to do is practice meditation for 20 minutes twice a day, once after waking up in the morning and once before dinner, in any setting or comfortable position.\n\n### How do I practise?\n\nFirst, choose a comfortable position, either sitting cross-legged or on a chair or sofa, as long as you are not lying down. Second, close your eyes and sit still for half a minute to a minute. When you feel relaxed, start repeating your mantra in your head. Your brain will generate many mixed thoughts at this time. The ideal state is when the mantra and the thoughts cease to exist, and a feeling of emptiness is achieved.\n\nAs it is written in the biography of [Steve Jobs,](https://amzn.to/3m8slUw) *“If you just sit and observe, you will see how restless your mind is. If you try to calm it, it only makes things worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there’s room to hear more subtle things — that’s when your intuition starts to blossom, and you start to see things more clearly and be in the present more. Your mind just slows down, and you see a tremendous expanse at the moment. You see so much more than you could see before. It’s a discipline; you have to practice it.”* I totally agree. The important part is **not controlling your thoughts but letting them go without interruption.**\n\nIt takes time but is worth it.\n\n### Yoga and Meditation Retreats\n\nOnce a year, I took a couple of weeks to do a **Yoga or Meditation retreat**. In 2019, I joined the Blooming Lotus Yoga retreat in Bali, including daily morning and evening yoga classes, theoretical study of the yoga system, daily morning and evening meditation sessions, and Bali’s cultural tour.\n\nAs an amateur CrossFit girl, I always find yoga too soothing and soft. I prefer to pump and punch in the gym or go to a HIIT class, making me feel like exercising. This seven-day intensive yoga training has changed my perspective on yoga classes in a fundamental way. I had a chance to learn Yin and Yang yoga. One is slightly faster, fluid, energetic and powerful; the other is softer, focusing on stretching and emphasising the endurance to achieve a state of unity between body and mind.\n\nYoga is not just a form of exercise but a way of life that unites body, mind and spirit, dating back 5,000 years to the Indus Valley. It has evolved over the millennia into many schools of thought, from the classical five major systems (wisdom yoga, karma yoga, hatha yoga, king yoga, kundalini yoga) and the eight branches of practice (abstinence, practice, asana, pranayama, mindfulness, concentration, meditation and samadhi) to the countless variations in modern society (hot yoga, Iyengar yoga, etc.).\n\nThe instructor briefly introduced us to Yoga Nidra, Chakras, Ayurveda and the yogic philosophy of ‘Unity of the Self’, and highlighted how to apply this theoretical knowledge to practical life by adopting healthy eating and exercise habits, self-healing and achieving a state of inner peace through a series of daily rituals. The most exciting part for me was the sister of Yoga: Ayurveda, derived from the Sanskrit word ‘life science’ with 5,000 years of history (Chinese medicine is also derived from Ayurveda).\n\nAyurveda believes that everything in the universe is made up of the five elements: Air (Akash), Wind (Vayu), Earth (Prithvi), Fire (Tejas) and Water (Apa), and the same is true of the human body (the five elements of Chinese medicine). These five elements are mixed to form Doshas’s life energy and are divided into three main categories.\n\nVata = Air + Wind\n\nPitta = Fire + Water\n\nKapha = Earth + Water\n\nThe Ayurvedic system teaches people to look within, understand themselves from the inside out, and find out what makes ‘themselves’. The essence of Ayurveda is to **find, discover and regulate your own sense of balance, to live in harmony with yourself, with others and with everything in the world.** No one can give more than what they have, which is why you must first start loving yourself. Be less obsessive with perfectionism and focus more on caring for yourself.\n\nThe most noticeable change since I started meditating is that I have become more aware of my ‘thoughts’ and many things I thought I had forgotten. Also, the emotions I had previously hidden and suppressed have come out (it can be horrifying at the beginning few months of practising meditation because you have to confront those ugly things that you avoided before).\n\n[Sigmund Freud](https://amzn.to/3rDamqn) once said, **“unexpressed emotions will never die. They are buried alive and will come forth later in uglier ways.”** No wonder I went through a couple of panic attacks in the past years --- my repressed emotions eventually reached their breaking point and suddenly attacked me.\n\nWith the help of meditation, I have more courage to face these deeply buried thoughts and feelings, which, although painful, are temporary, and when they are resolved one by one, I will no longer be disturbed by them and will have a clear-thinking mind.\n\nMeditation, like most things, is a long-term process, and just as the body needs to keep exercising to build muscle, the brain needs to keep meditating to develop awareness. Once you can be aware of yourself rather than follow the crowd, you’ll better understand who you really are and what you really want. And once this fundamental problem has been solved, other secondary issues that arise from a lack of clarity about ‘who you are’ will cease to exist.\n\n### Digital Detox Retreat\n\nDue to my work’s nature, I am always on my phone or in front of my computer, swiping through various social media platforms at all times, and actively/passively receiving a lot of fragmented information. Because of the fragmented knowledge in my head, I cannot focus and am easily affected by all kinds of redundant and cluttered information whenever I am thinking about complex issues. I constantly feel tired and less productive.\n\nIn 2018, I got a chance to check out a digital detox retreat in Auckland. It’s an excellent excuse for me to get away from the screen, be alone with myself and reflect on myself. In those three days, I didn’t touch any of my electronic devices. Each morning, I woke up naturally and practised two full meditation sessions, including 10-15 minutes of yoga, 5 minutes of breathing exercises, 20 minutes of Transcendental Meditation, resting in bed for the last 10 minutes and then repeating the above set of movements.\n\nThe rest of the day was writing journals, reading books, going out, and talking with other participants. I remembered one day I was sitting on my balcony and meditating. The Sun was shining brightly before I closed my eyes. When I woke up from the half-hour-long meditation, it was drizzling outside, and a little bird standing on my balcony, singing freely.\n\nIt reminds me of the time I watched the movie *Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.* The heroine saw a deer strolling on the green grass under the billboard, with the sunray in the backdrop. The heroine could not help but talk to the deer about her love for her daughter, and she returned to nature and faced the soft part of her heart. I shared the same feeling, appreciating nature’s beauty with gratitude.​\n\n## Psychedelic Experience\n\nIn 2021, I had my first psychedelic experience with the Grandfather plant, San Pedro, at [The Lighthouse Retreat](https://lighthouseretreats.co.uk/).\n\n2 trips in 4 days let me ‘saw’ the themes constantly haunted my mind: **time, space, reality and dream**. We all know language could be limited when you try to describe something overpowering magnificent. Here is my attempt to describe those visions and insights:​\n\nEighty-four thousand thoughts and ideas,\n\nLandscape transformation in the whirligig of time,\n\nEverything is evolving and decaying in front of my eyes.​\n\nVivid Colours dancing along with the music of nature,\n\nInfinite fractals emerging and disappearing like the Mandelbrot set and Mandala of Sanskrit.\n\nVan Gogh’s painting in a tangible form.​\n\nRam Dass’s message comes into my mind,\n\n“We’re all just walking each other home”.\n\nWe are nameless and formless,\n\nWe are a pixel and we are a Buddha,\n\nWas vernünftig ist, das ist wirklich,\n\nWe’re loved just for being who we are, just for existing.​\n\nLet’s accept ourselves and others in full,\n\nTry not to control, try not to force, try to surrender to the power of the universe.\n\nTime and space are a total illusion.\n\nThe reality doesn’t seem like what we see.\n\nTo see beauty, use our heart, not our eyes.\n\nFeel, and we shall know.\n\nSeek, and we shall find.​\n\nI rise above the earth and travel through abstract concepts and patterns.\n\nA snap of the finger is the moment of eternity.\n\nI could have lived forever in that dazzling and wonderful dream,\n\nBut your sweet smile pulls me back to the material world.​\n\nRemember, remember,\n\nLife is the eighth wonder.\n\nWhen we genuinely want something,\n\nThe whole universe is always on our side.\n\n​P.S. My teacher Isher at the retreat centre gave me the nickname “Zen Master” because I could sit on the platform for hours, calm and still. He mentioned my peaceful energy would help to balance unstable emotions from others.\n\nApart from the above experience, I do fully echo with what Steve Jobs once said, “*You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future”.*\n\nEverything that happened in my life has already connected in a beautiful circle. What I need to do is just follow my intuition and walk through the journey with love. Thanks to Grandpa San Pedro! See you soon, Grandma Ayahuasca!​\n\nP.P.S. I was astonished when I found Mandala flowers at the retreat centre! When I studied Buddhism at an early age, I named myself Mandala, and after two decades, I finally met ‘myself’ again.\n\n## Ultimate Goal  ​\n\nLast but not least, my grandpa left a poem to my family before dying in 2009.\n\nHe was a lifelong learner and independent thinker with intellectual curiosity on many subjects. Although he went through numerous ups and downs in his lifetime, he chose to have an innocent heart with a peaceful mind.\n\nI hope one day I could reach the same level as what he called oneness between me and the universe.​​\n\n![My grandpa Qi Kaimin's poem](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JYi1VRrCbImDdpKHVTlal.jpeg?height=827&width=639)\n\n《静坐吟》\n\n流光荏苒去无踪，\n\n富贵如云过眼空。\n\n淡泊生涯游物外，\n\n超然世俗学禅宗。\n\n阴阳和化情缘净，\n\n动静参修性意通。\n\n精气相乘神内守，\n\n天人合一九霄中。 ​​​​\n\n​Meditation\n\nThe light of the day is gone without a trace,\n\nWealth and fame are like clouds passing by.\n\nI am a simple person living a life outside of the material world,\n\nAnd I have studied Zen from the journey within.\n\nYin and Yang harmonise and purify my emotions,\n\nMoving and meditating cultivated my mind.\n\nThe essence of the spirit is my inner guard,\n\nThe universe and I unified in one.\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=295](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=295)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635895268, "digest": "goEs88Y0eo6SuQ1fp8TCQLMFI7X7HICINBtS_zYiH2o", "contributor": "0x6902E5CAf41158d3eD516cBd6D2807BB63863F42"}

{"id": "Lhuo9viqEeEGm7mcZAB1flU6ZX16XhaC5voTPA4VSc8", "title": "The Emergence of Liquidity as a Service (LaaS) DeFi Industry", "body": "## Why is liquidity important?\n\nLiquidity is important because all of crypto runs on liquidity just like the world runs on fossil fuel energies. Protocols and platforms that have high liquidity depth will be able to support more efficient trades. Over time this creates a monopolistic moat vs other protocols and platforms similar to how corporations like Google and Microsoft print money at will.\n\nLiquidity mining has proven to be the [go to method for DeFi startups to bootstrap liquidity](https://ethereumprice.org/newsletter/token-incentives-are-bootstrapping-more-than-just-defi/). This was initially used to great success to attract liquidity to protocols. However this is a costly endeavor and it has been found that the yield farmers, who are the primary liquidity providers, are economically incentivized to sell often to lock in yields. This increases sell pressure, erodes treasury buying power, and decreases the token value for long term holders of the protocol.\n\nCapital efficiency is a key metric for treasuries because they spend millions of dollars a week in incentives to source liquidity for their projects. The liquidity as a service (LaaS) industry is quickly catching steam, attracting $5B USD TVL in less than a quarter by offering greater liquidity depth and a higher capital efficiency. This nascent sector is being shaped by protocols such as [Curve Bribes](https://bribe.crv.finance/), [ Olympus Pro](https://www.olympusdao.finance/pro), [Tokemak](https://www.tokemak.xyz/), and [UMA](https://umaproject.org/).\n\n## Curve Bribes  - Liquidity Direction\n\nA protocol can participate in[ Curve bribes](https://tokenbrice.xyz/crv-wars/) to increase liquidity depth. When a protocol engages in a curve bribe, they are bribing to control larger voting power, which is used to direct liquidity to a desired Curve pool. Abracadabra utilized bribes to great success, creating[ over $700m total liquidity](https://tokenbrice.xyz/crv-wars/#the-spellmim-case) for the protocol’s decentralized coin MIM. Curve Bribes on the MIM pool on CRV receive higher yields via increased liquidity rewards (SPELL + CRV incentives) as a result of the bribe. Currently \\~14m/month ([130M $SPELL @ .028)](https://twitter.com/mim_spell/status/1447207616409636864) are allocated to Curve Bribes and towards Curve’s new votium system. For \\~14m/month, Abracadabra gets significantly increased liquidity depth.\n\n## Olympus Pro - Bond Marketplace\n\nOlympus Pro allows protocols to create a marketplace in which liquidity providers can trade their LP tokens in exchange for tokens held in the protocol’s treasury such as governance tokens or other tokens in the treasury. This marketplace allows protocols to buy back their liquidity and eventually own all of it, thereby being able to provide liquidity without paying large amounts to incentivize the liquidity pools. The marketplace uses a bonding mechanism to create a more efficient marketplace by automated price discovery.\n\nNot only does this increase treasury diversification by owning LP tokens, the cost for liquidity also decreases,  which is often one of the highest recurring treasury expenditures. For example[ Alchemix emits about 16,000 ALCX/week](https://forum.alchemix.fi/public/d/210-aip-21-alcx-bond-program) (\\~30m USD/month @ ALCX = $475) to incentivize liquidity pools. One potential downside to Olympus Pro is that it requires a high upfront cost to begin buying back liquidity. Funds are usually raised by selling governance tokens at a discount in replacement of a yield to liquidity providers.\n\nSince the initial launch of Olympus Pro in October, OP bonds have [captured $7.5m of liquidity](https://olympusdao.medium.com/olympus-pro-introducing-cohort-2-launch-partners-6b64dbe2b18c) for our first seven partners — Abracadabra, Alchemix, Float Protocol, Frax, Pendle, ShapeShift, and StakeDAO. Olympus DAO TVL has grown from [$150m TVL](https://olympusdao.medium.com/?p=d8db3052fca5) in September 2021 to nearly [$4b USD](https://dappradar.com/ethereum/defi/olympus-dao) (end of October 2021 at time of writing).\n\n## Tokemak - Decentralized Market Maker\n\nTokemark offers decentralized market making to any other protocol, thereby creating sustainable liquidity and more capital efficient markets. The Tokemak team was originally spun off from a professional DeFi market making firm Fractal. Tokemark recently started the process of liquidity deployment and finished its first [Collateralization of Reactors Event](https://medium.com/tokemak/c-o-r-e-collateralization-of-reactors-event-2a2d5b2f8e70) (C.o.R.E) with C.o.R.E. 2 planned to start in early November 2021. As of the end of October 2021, in less than 2 months Tokemak’s TVL has surpassed [$1b TVL](https://thedefiant.io/tokemak-amm-1-billion-tvl/) and is set to launch its own version of directing liquidity via TOKE voting power in December 2021.\n\nLiquidity provider rewards are paid in TOKE and the trading fees are accrued in the protocol. Over time these fees will hit a critical mass, [the \"singularity\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vum5l-acbm0),  which will allow the protocol to self-sustain without the need for liquidity providers. TOKE holders can then direct this capital as they see fit, earning trading fees without paying out any more TOKE rewards, thus closing the liquidity cycle.\n\n## Success tokens - another treasury diversification option\n\n[Success tokens](https://medium.com/uma-project/success-tokens-an-incentive-aligned-way-for-vc-funds-to-invest-in-daos-1e8b8244f2f4) allow a DAO to offer investors call options on the governance token. Investors pay the full price of the token. This could be a possibly lucrative way to raise capital from investors like venture capitalists or even other treasuries so that both treasuries can diversify by swapping these call options. Who doesn’t want a call option on their favorite DeFi project?\n\n## Range Tokens are a capital efficient way to source liquidity\n\n[Range tokens](https://medium.com/uma-project/treasury-diversification-with-range-tokens-145d4b12614e) by UMA allow DAOs to borrow funds without the risk of liquidation and simultaneously diversifies the treasury. Range tokens function like[ convertible debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convertiblebond.asp). The advantage to raising funds using range tokens is that the governance tokens are sold later, presumably when governance tokens are valued higher than when the funds were initially raised thus increasing capital efficiency of the governance tokens. Governance tokens can be used to open a risk free collateral debt position with range tokens and use the funds raised to fund treasury purchases/expenditures such as buying liquidity with[ Olympus Pro Bonds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTNplJBQvMA&t=19s&ab_channel=Bankless) or [Tokemak](https://medium.com/tokemak/introducing-tokemak-the-utility-for-sustainable-liquidity-8b99a4757301).\n\nUMA used a [range token pilot program to raise $2.6m](https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-raises-2-6mm-in-the-pilot-of-the-range-token-de5be578fa5e) in funding from investors. The range token had a three month duration with a 25% APY yield and a price range of UMA being between $4 and $12. If UMA is greater than $12 at expiry, the investor earns an effective APY higher than 25% because the investor has long exposure to a $12 call option. If UMA is less than $4, the investor earns an effective APY lower than 25%, but the investor has short exposure to a $4 put option. Distribution was completed 1:1 between UMA and investors for speed and simplicity, but has flexibility to be distributed in the best way that suits the treasury’s needs.\n\n## KPI Options can incentivize treasuries to source liquidity more efficiently\n\nKPI options are financial derivative contracts made by UMA which allow a protocol to incentivize progress towards a specific KPI (key performance indicator) goal and pay out increasing rewards based on how well the KPI metric was hit. KPI options offer [an alternative to liquidity incentives](https://medium.com/uma-project/state-of-kpi-liquidity-mining-40cbdec79ea8) and attempts to align liquidity provider incentives with the protocol incentives to prevent excessive selling pressure while increasing liquidity depth with the promise of paying out more rewards the greater the liquidity depth achieved is.\n\nAlthough the current approach incentivizes higher liquidity depth, it is not capital efficient because the more successful the KPI options are and the more liquidity depth that is achieved, the greater the cost of treasury expenditure will be. Rather, KPI options should incentivize the adoption of LaaS services such as Curve Bribes, Olympus Pro, and Tokemak. This would add another economic incentive to incentivize more sustainable liquidity sourcing treasury strategies.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLaaS is a fast growing crypto infrastructure industry with high demand because every protocol needs liquidity. Not all protocol’s are utilizing the most capital efficient ways towards sustainable liquidity sourcing as they rush to front-run the inevitable LaaS services backlog. As DeFi continues to grow, LaaS will continue to flourish and will create the DeFi industry legos necessary to support future DeFi sectors.", "timestamp": 1635896828, "digest": "QAh3W-Ovy9C39WcUItk_IH0ZgHrWZmwHJZQCzoKoAWE", "contributor": "0x829Ceb00fC74bD087b1e50d31ec628a90894cD52"}

Arbitrum enables high-throughput, low-cost smart contracts while maintaining reliable security. It enables us to interact with smart contracts at a fraction of the cost of using Ethereum natively, all while using the same tools you use to interact with Ethereum today.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aO89hukdh4X-VvfV_mRM4.png?height=689&width=1999)\n\n**We have seen the rapid change and growth speed in this L2 ecosystem and we’re quick to start developing on it, releasing Dev Protocol L2 on Arbitrum today.**\n\n## Why use Dev Protocol L2?\n\n* Reducing fees for users\n* Making staking and onboarding easier\n* Fast transaction throughput\n\nThe most powerful answer as to why, is quite simple, gas fees. L2 reduces gas fees for all users to a fraction of the cost. By reducing the gas fees to a much lower level than mainnet, it will make it much easier for all of us to use the Dev Protocol on a daily basis. This alone will foster new growth for more creators and supporters to join the ecosystem.\n\n## Stakes.social L2 has launched\n\n![Snapshot of the initial launch](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3OcMS78NP7N1nnn0YJpJx.png?height=1441&width=2560)\n\nThis is a very beginning phase and has a high earning potential. If you want to join early and get more opportunities, please try the \"How to migrate to L2\" section below.\n\n*\\* Before start using this, please understand that [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/) is in public beta and learn about the risks.*\n\n## How to migrate to L2\n\nThis is a quick way to get started. (A detailed guide is published in [Docs](https://docs.devprotocol.xyz/en/stakes-social/onboard-guide-arbitrum/).)\n\n1. Transfer tokens from Ethereum mainnet (L1) to Arbitrum (L2)\n   1. Transfer DEV → Use [Dev Layer Bridge](https://bridge.devprotocol.xyz/)\n   2. Transfer ETH → Use[ Artbitrum One Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/)\n2. Choose Arbitrum network in your wallet and open Stakes.social\n3. Depending on whether you want to stake or onboard a new project\n   1. If you are a creator: Please apply for onboarding. If you have already onboarded on stakes.social L1, please wait for the exact step guide from the team.\n   2. If you want to stake: simply stake to your favorite creators as you did before for a fraction of the cost.\n\n* DEV contract adress on Arbitrum: 0x91F5dC90979b058eBA3be6B7B7e523df7e84e137 ([Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x91F5dC90979b058eBA3be6B7B7e523df7e84e137))\n\n\n* Direct link of DEV on [Uniswap Arbitrum](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x91F5dC90979b058eBA3be6B7B7e523df7e84e137).\n\nIn addition, the Dev Protocol L2 comes standard with the sToken, which means that everyone who stakes to creators has a chance to receive NFTs and Perks from creators in the future! Please stay tuned for more information about Perks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe would like you to try out this wonderful experience on Arbitrum and give us your feedback. This is just the first step in expanding the new creator ecosystem, and there will be a series of exciting updates to the Dev Protocol after the L2 launch.\n\nWe hope that this new environment will spark the growth of our ecosystem, which ultimately will impact all of the decentralized creator economy, spilling over benefits for everyone involved. We are continuously working on developing the Dev Protocol to maximize the creativity for all creators and will continue to do so.\n\nStay tuned and keep an eye out for the next exciting update!\n\n![The symbol of \"Maximize the creativity\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Mo6jSuaob-nV4ocliyvHP.png?height=300&width=600)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635902840, "digest": "o9aCtLJf2IyO1-Ix7b_7RFTdsH_x6mF6Q4_z3CEQthM", "contributor": "0xd0569003436AeD6a15D8234003Fd333d80411Ea2"}

You can check-out any time you like, but you can never leave.* *🎶*\n\nThe greatest inventions in history are the results of *someone*, *somewhere*, wanting *something* that has never before existed. In the process of going from [zero to one](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296), they manifest a new reality for themselves and the world around them. These historical inflection points are somewhat of a paradox, often arising from an individual or group solving a what seems to be a local problem that turns out to be inherently global in scale. After all, if I’m having an issue, odds are high that someone else on this giant blue and green sphere is experiencing the exact same problem. By solving our own problems, we often solve those of others.\n\nYet innovation is not merely about solving the problems of today - it is also about expanding the problem sets of the future. Progress is an accumulative phenomenon, such that innovation x leads to innovation y, which leads to innovation z, on and on, ad infinitum. The creators of today are building on the foundations of those before them, in turn adding their own layers that will be built on by those of the future. We truly [stand on the shoulders of giants](https://fs.blog/2020/04/shoulders-of-giants/#:\\~:text=%E2%80%9CIf%20I%20have%20seen%20further,on%20the%20shoulders%20of%20giants.%E2%80%9D&text=Standing%20on%20the%20shoulders%20of%20giants%20is%20a%20necessary%20part,what%20you%20do%20less%20valuable).\n\nIn this equation of the future, time is the limiting reactant. Innovation y fails in a world where it is necessitated by innovation x, but where innovation x is yet to exist. Each innovation is thus a *spark* for innovations of the future, such that it acts as a branching point on a tree, each spawning many new innovations in its wake.\n\n![Ideas are the neurons of innovation - each idea creates the spark needed for the next.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7rT76-2KEESTJQftXgKx0.gif?height=262&width=455)\n\nTake for example the internet and its subsequent development track from Web 1.0 (read only) to Web 2.0 (read *and* write) to Web 3.0 ([read ](https://www.practicalecommerce.com/Basic-Definitions-Web-1-0-Web-2-0-Web-3-0)*[and](https://www.practicalecommerce.com/Basic-Definitions-Web-1-0-Web-2-0-Web-3-0)*[ write and ](https://www.practicalecommerce.com/Basic-Definitions-Web-1-0-Web-2-0-Web-3-0)*[execute](https://www.practicalecommerce.com/Basic-Definitions-Web-1-0-Web-2-0-Web-3-0)*)*.* Both Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 have spawned thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of new ideas and innovations. Web 1.0 was the spark needed for Web 2.0, providing the “read” functionality first and foremost so that the “write” functionality could later be added. Yet it was also the spark for many ideas, products, and companies built on the back of Web 1.0 itself.\n\nWhich brings us to crypto - the paradigm shift of paradigm shifts.\n\nFor years, open, permissionless networks unable to be hampered by gatekeepers or coerced by kings were but a figment of the imagination. For such a grand ambition to become reality, the world needed a spark. That spark came in 2008, when a pseudonymous cypherpunk named Satoshi Nakomoto solved the [Byzantine General’s problem](https://river.com/learn/what-is-the-byzantine-generals-problem/) and created a mechanism for decentralized consensus in absence of a trusted third party. Satoshi then applied their findings to create an electronic, peer-to-peer cash system dubbed Bitcoin and posted them online, for the world to see, in what will be remembered as one of the most revolutionary [white-papers](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) in all of human history.\n\nBut this is not an article on Bitcoin’s merits, per se - whether or not it is hard money, whether or not it is digital gold. This is an article about ideas and innovation and the places they take us. And the places that Satoshi has allowed us to go are merely in their infant stages of discovery.\n\n***We have walked into the digital Hotel California, and we will never leave.***\n\nAkin to the many great inventions of history, Bitcoin will be defined as much for the path it has paved for new innovations as it will be for the value it provides alone. And while Bitcoin is the seminal blockchain of the crypto ecosystem, the overwhelming majority of these new innovations will *not* be built on the backbone of Bitcoin the *blockchain*. But they will be built on the backbone of Bitcoin the *idea* - that consensus in absence of a third party is not only theoretically possible, but concretely possible. Today.\n\nIt is this idea that Vitalik Buterin expanded upon in his creation of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/). If Bitcoin is sound money backed by a blockchain, then Ethereum is programmable money backed by the same technology. In a sense, Ethereum is to Web 2.0 (read *and* write) as Bitcoin is to Web 1.0 (read only). It takes the Bitcoin idea and adds new functionality to it - a native programming language, a zero to one process in and of itself, such that new innovations can take the Ethereum idea and add new functionality to it.\n\n> ***The majority of future crypto innovations will not be built on top of Bitcoin the blockchain. But they will be built on top of Bitcoin the idea.***\n\nYet it has not been all roses for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the crypto ecosystem. Doubt is a frequent companion of hope, and crypto is living this reality daily. For every problem that a crypto-technology purports to solve, there are hundreds (if not thousands) of naysayers and opponents standing in its path. Such obstacles range from ‘experts’ that pronounce Bitcoin’s time of death with each 20%+ drawdown - [90 ‘deaths’ in 2018 after 125 in 2017](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-died-90-times-2018-120041001.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJBWUoNs_qKwEMCDBSXyWqZ8JURon1S97rycSpY2hkF_6i-RqDPan8RUohmP95WoHHAGYplyltcDbOCH8ciJScJopFqobvp7jVzkDbAfBiTiacoqVBfHBWwzU60TsBGi0HYK_rq5baXUvcfnj7v0En6XtZvS4K_Bpp2a-0CbDvtE) - to nation states such as [China ‘banning crypto’ for the nth time in 'September of 2021.](https://techstory.in/twitter-breaks-into-a-riot-of-memes-as-china-bans-crypto-again/)\n\n![\"Crypto is dead\" is code for \"buy the dip\".](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zlNinb3zV_Qj3AHHv_-G8.png?height=578&width=1250)\n\nWhile intuition suggests we proceed with caution, history tells us that crypto technologies are in good company for a simple fact - the most revolutionary ideas in human history frequently face stark opposition in their infancy stages. Take the printing press, for example, invented in the mid 1400s by Johannes Gutenburg. It found a formidable critic at the turn of the 16th century in the Roman Catholic Church, who recognized the press’s power to democratize the spread of information and subvert the Church’s ability to control the flow of religious content. Or how about the internet, perhaps the most revolutionary technology in history? In 1998, during the early stages of its adoption, a Nobel-prize winning economist made the following quote: *“By 2005, or so, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.”*\n\nThings are not until they are. And like the middle school recess bully, critics love to take shots at emerging technologies before problems of puberty are fleshed out.\n\nBut no matter. At the same time that skeptics are screaming into the wind, the market is speaking through a megaphone. In the past two weeks, the total [crypto market cap reached all time highs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-market-cap-hits-new-all-time-high-as-btc-eth-soar) as Bitcoin broke out to a new peak of $67K while Ethereum did the same to a tune of $4.4K.\n\nBitcoin is slowly (and programmatically) chipping away at the market cap of gold, while Ethereum, whose smart contract functionality provides a base layer infrastructure on which to create a decentralized financial system (‘De-Fi’, ie *Decentralized Finance*), just [surpassed the market cap of the world’s largest bank - JP Morgan](https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2021/ethereums-market-cap-jumps-to-513-billion-surpasses-visa-jpmorgan-chase/). What the critics mistake for fragility is in actuality its opposite. In an anti-fragile process, weaknesses brought to light quickly become strengths due to the velocity of information and creativity inherent in these open crypto networks. Constraints breed creativity, and each time crypto-networks are threatened the communities rally at lightening pace.\n\nThe immune responses inherent in crypto networks allow for the creation of a rock solid foundation upon which to build. We intuitively understand that a skyscraper is only as strong as its base, and those built on top of sand will inevitably succumb to the pressures of time. Yet with each [FUD](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=FUD) attack survived by Bitcoin and Ethereum, grains of sand morph to rock-solid concrete, enabling us to build higher - and see further -than we ever imagined.\n\n### Hotel Cryptofornia\n\nAs we stand today, it is as if each of us has been given all-access keys to the future. Each section of the crypto ecosystem represents a different room of the digital Hotel California, and you can choose the door through which you enter while having full autonomy of where you go once inside.\n\nFirst, on entry points. One of the great strengths of the crypto ecosystem it that it is inherently non-discriminatory. Bitcoin and Ethereum (and any other cryptocurrency, for that matter) care not how you got there. They operate in binary 1s and 0s - you either own or you do not. This is perhaps the simplest description of the manner in which they have bootstrapped themselves into dominance - BTC and ETH turn 0s into 1s by incentivizing new users with the strongest value proposition in the world - financial upside. Buy at x, and at some time in the future you’ll have x + y.\n\nViewed from inside the hotel, the manner in which you entered is irrelevant. Check in  at the front desk (*Bitcoin*)? Welcome! You’ll find there is much more to explore. Or perhaps you prefer to operate through the concierge (*Ethereum*)? *Benvenuto*, I love optionality myself. Did the DJ from the pool party (*Dogecoin*) show you in? Nice to see you, I can tell that roller coaster experiences are your idea of a good time. Oh, it was the art wing of the hotel (*NFTs*) that brought you in? You’ll find that we are just getting started.\n\nReality is such that most of the traffic entering the crypto-ecosystem comes via the same on-ramps - the same cryptocurrencies (BTC/ETH) and the same exchanges (Coinbase). But while the entry points may have high similarity, the interior of Hotel Cryptofornia is anything but uniform. In fact, there is a massive “Under Construction” sign in the middle of the front lawn with a progress bar on that shows well below 1% completion.\n\n![We are still \\*very\\* early.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jxdwN9ygNfLTaCdobM67w.gif?height=844&width=1500)\n\nThe interplay between open for business and under construction is a key distinction for what makes crypto so unique in its early stages. Few other industries in history have [sold construction passes to the general public at a higher clip than what is happening in crypto right now.](https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI/status/1396837073202532357?s=20) Anyone, regardless of how old or how wealthy, can can grab a hard hat and get to work in the hotel due to the space’s permissionless nature.\n\nAnd as each new person walks through the door, the base layer of the crypto ecosystem continues to solidify like grains of sand being turned to rock solid concrete. Bitcoin and Ethereum are proxies for the strength of the foundation, and as they continue to assert their dominance the possibility set of future floor plans expands.\n\nHotel Cryptofornia itself represents an intersection between the future and the present, a place that each of us inhabits by nature of walking through its doors. We can participate today in any number of ways - such as buying coins on exchanges like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com), browsing NFTs on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/%5C), or maybe even [sending Bitcoin via the Lightning Network](https://strike.me/en/). And while each of these actions are opportunities to participate in the *economy of now*, they are inherently shaping the *economy of the future* as well.\n\nWhat that economy of the future will look like, however, we can only guess. While each of us can gaze upwards from the ground floor to get an idea of what elevator stops we will be able to make, the clouds begin to obscure our vision the higher we look. In current state, we are merely re-designing the world’s pre-existing infrastructure. We are looking for the decentralized alternatives to Web 2.0 that are enabled by blockchain technology and Web 3.0. Take [BlueSky](https://twitter.com/bluesky?s=20), for example - Jack Dorsey and Twitter’s attempt to create a new standard for decentralized social media. Or [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz) (the site on which this article is published) - the first decentralized publishing platform that is built and run by its contributors.\n\nAs innovative as both of these platforms are, they are both following the same roadmap by leveraging crypto technology to reimagine a Web2 idea - “create the decentralized, Web3 version of the centralized, Web2 platform”. But what happens when we start building new floors of the hotel that have no pre-existing blueprint? Through this lens, the outline of the future becomes less clearly defined the higher we look.\n\nSo while the current construction of Hotel Cryptofornia is nothing short of remarkable, we have much, much more to build. The Google and Facebook moments of the space have yet to arrive. And while I am not sure what they will look like, I am sure that they will change the world in ways that we have never before seen.\n\nBut in order to build the dreams of the future, we must deal with the realities of the present. And one such reality of where we currently stand is that in order for the crypto ecosystem to grow and create the future we dream of, more people must come through the door.\n\nThe beauty of Hotel Cryptofornia is that it is permissionless in nature. It does not matter why you come, all that matters is that you do. Perhaps the doors through which you enter will shape your perceptions and experiences inside, but feel free to enter in any way you like. My personal path has been Bitcoin → ETH → NFTs → DeFi → Web3, but you can have any one you like. Because what matters isn’t the way in which the path winds, but simply that path itself exists. More 1s, and less 0s.\n\nSo come one, come all - Hotel Cryptofornia is open for business. Enter however you like and don’t be afraid to explore once you are inside. The floor plan is currently under construction, but with each day you’ll better understand where everything is. Except for the exit, that is, because there’s no such thing to be found. Technology is a one way street and Hotel Cryptofornia is no exception. You can check in any time you like, but you can never leave.", "timestamp": 1635903683, "digest": "5f9dALnFQQX3PLNTNPCwMPSZ_15gdpC4kUxcT8FRnx8", "contributor": "0x5A8F66b24de24e1c829e03c9D3EFD3343064083c"}

You can check-out any time you like, but you can never leave.* *🎶*\n\nThe greatest inventions in history are the results of *someone*, *somewhere*, wanting *something* that has never before existed. In the process of going from [zero to one](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296), they manifest a new reality for themselves and the world around them. These historical inflection points are somewhat of a paradox, often arising from an individual or group solving a what seems to be a local problem that turns out to be inherently global in scale. After all, if I’m having an issue, odds are high that someone else on this giant blue and green sphere is experiencing the exact same problem. By solving our own problems, we often solve those of others.\n\nYet innovation is not merely about solving the problems of today - it is also about expanding the problem sets of the future. Progress is an accumulative phenomenon, such that innovation x leads to innovation y, which leads to innovation z, on and on, ad infinitum. The creators of today are building on the foundations of those before them, in turn adding their own layers that will be built on by those of the future. We truly [stand on the shoulders of giants](https://fs.blog/2020/04/shoulders-of-giants/#:\\~:text=%E2%80%9CIf%20I%20have%20seen%20further,on%20the%20shoulders%20of%20giants.%E2%80%9D&text=Standing%20on%20the%20shoulders%20of%20giants%20is%20a%20necessary%20part,what%20you%20do%20less%20valuable).\n\nIn this equation of the future, time is the limiting reactant. Innovation y fails in a world where it is necessitated by innovation x, but where innovation x is yet to exist. Each innovation is thus a *spark* for innovations of the future, such that it acts as a branching point on a tree, each spawning many new innovations in its wake.\n\n![Ideas are the neurons of innovation - each idea creates the spark needed for the next.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7rT76-2KEESTJQftXgKx0.gif?height=262&width=455)\n\nTake for example the internet and its subsequent development track from Web 1.0 (read only) to Web 2.0 (read *and* write) to Web 3.0 ([read ](https://www.practicalecommerce.com/Basic-Definitions-Web-1-0-Web-2-0-Web-3-0)*[and](https://www.practicalecommerce.com/Basic-Definitions-Web-1-0-Web-2-0-Web-3-0)*[ write and ](https://www.practicalecommerce.com/Basic-Definitions-Web-1-0-Web-2-0-Web-3-0)*[execute](https://www.practicalecommerce.com/Basic-Definitions-Web-1-0-Web-2-0-Web-3-0)*)*.* Both Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 have spawned thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of new ideas and innovations. Web 1.0 was the spark needed for Web 2.0, providing the “read” functionality first and foremost so that the “write” functionality could later be added. Yet it was also the spark for many ideas, products, and companies built on the back of Web 1.0 itself.\n\nWhich brings us to crypto - the paradigm shift of paradigm shifts.\n\nFor years, open, permissionless networks unable to be hampered by gatekeepers or coerced by kings were but a figment of the imagination. For such a grand ambition to become reality, the world needed a spark. That spark came in 2008, when a pseudonymous cypherpunk named Satoshi Nakomoto solved the [Byzantine General’s problem](https://river.com/learn/what-is-the-byzantine-generals-problem/) and created a mechanism for decentralized consensus in absence of a trusted third party. Satoshi then applied their findings to create an electronic, peer-to-peer cash system dubbed Bitcoin and posted them online, for the world to see, in what will be remembered as one of the most revolutionary [white-papers](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) in all of human history.\n\nBut this is not an article on Bitcoin’s merits, per se - whether or not it is hard money, whether or not it is digital gold. This is an article about ideas and innovation and the places they take us. And the places that Satoshi has allowed us to go are merely in their infant stages of discovery.\n\n***We have walked into the digital Hotel California, and we will never leave.***\n\nAkin to the many great inventions of history, Bitcoin will be defined as much for the path it has paved for new innovations as it will be for the value it provides alone. And while Bitcoin is the seminal blockchain of the crypto ecosystem, the overwhelming majority of these new innovations will *not* be built on the backbone of Bitcoin the *blockchain*. But they will be built on the backbone of Bitcoin the *idea* - that consensus in absence of a third party is not only theoretically possible, but concretely possible. Today.\n\nIt is this idea that Vitalik Buterin expanded upon in his creation of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/). If Bitcoin is sound money backed by a blockchain, then Ethereum is programmable money backed by the same technology. In a sense, Ethereum is to Web 2.0 (read *and* write) as Bitcoin is to Web 1.0 (read only). It takes the Bitcoin idea and adds new functionality to it - a native programming language, a zero to one process in and of itself, such that new innovations can take the Ethereum idea and add new functionality to it.\n\n> ***The majority of future crypto innovations will not be built on top of Bitcoin the blockchain. But they will be built on top of Bitcoin the idea.***\n\nYet it has not been all roses for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the crypto ecosystem. Doubt is a frequent companion of hope, and crypto is living this reality daily. For every problem that a crypto-technology purports to solve, there are hundreds (if not thousands) of naysayers and opponents standing in its path. Such obstacles range from ‘experts’ that pronounce Bitcoin’s time of death with each 20%+ drawdown - [90 ‘deaths’ in 2018 after 125 in 2017](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-died-90-times-2018-120041001.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJBWUoNs_qKwEMCDBSXyWqZ8JURon1S97rycSpY2hkF_6i-RqDPan8RUohmP95WoHHAGYplyltcDbOCH8ciJScJopFqobvp7jVzkDbAfBiTiacoqVBfHBWwzU60TsBGi0HYK_rq5baXUvcfnj7v0En6XtZvS4K_Bpp2a-0CbDvtE) - to nation states such as [China ‘banning crypto’ for the nth time in 'September of 2021.](https://techstory.in/twitter-breaks-into-a-riot-of-memes-as-china-bans-crypto-again/)\n\n![\"Crypto is dead\" is code for \"buy the dip\".](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zlNinb3zV_Qj3AHHv_-G8.png?height=578&width=1250)\n\nWhile intuition suggests we proceed with caution, history tells us that crypto technologies are in good company for a simple fact - the most revolutionary ideas in human history frequently face stark opposition in their infancy stages. Take the printing press, for example, invented in the mid 1400s by Johannes Gutenburg. It found a formidable critic at the turn of the 16th century in the Roman Catholic Church, who recognized the press’s power to democratize the spread of information and subvert the Church’s ability to control the flow of religious content. Or how about the internet, perhaps the most revolutionary technology in history? In 1998, during the early stages of its adoption, a Nobel-prize winning economist made the following quote: *“By 2005, or so, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.”*\n\nThings are not until they are. And like the middle school recess bully, critics love to take shots at emerging technologies before problems of puberty are fleshed out.\n\nBut no matter. At the same time that skeptics are screaming into the wind, the market is speaking through a megaphone. In the past two weeks, the total [crypto market cap reached all time highs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-market-cap-hits-new-all-time-high-as-btc-eth-soar) as Bitcoin broke out to a new peak of $67K while Ethereum did the same to a tune of $4.4K.\n\nBitcoin is slowly (and programmatically) chipping away at the market cap of gold, while Ethereum, whose smart contract functionality provides a base layer infrastructure on which to create a decentralized financial system (‘De-Fi’, ie *Decentralized Finance*), just [surpassed the market cap of the world’s largest bank - JP Morgan](https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2021/ethereums-market-cap-jumps-to-513-billion-surpasses-visa-jpmorgan-chase/). What the critics mistake for fragility is in actuality its opposite. In an anti-fragile process, weaknesses brought to light quickly become strengths due to the velocity of information and creativity inherent in these open crypto networks. Constraints breed creativity, and each time crypto-networks are threatened the communities rally at lightening pace.\n\nThe immune responses inherent in crypto networks allow for the creation of a rock solid foundation upon which to build. We intuitively understand that a skyscraper is only as strong as its base, and those built on top of sand will inevitably succumb to the pressures of time. Yet with each [FUD](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=FUD) attack survived by Bitcoin and Ethereum, grains of sand morph to rock-solid concrete, enabling us to build higher - and see further -than we ever imagined.\n\n### Hotel Cryptofornia\n\nAs we stand today, it is as if each of us has been given all-access keys to the future. Each section of the crypto ecosystem represents a different room of the digital Hotel California, and you can choose the door through which you enter while having full autonomy of where you go once inside.\n\nFirst, on entry points. One of the great strengths of the crypto ecosystem it that it is inherently non-discriminatory. Bitcoin and Ethereum (and any other cryptocurrency, for that matter) care not how you got there. They operate in binary 1s and 0s - you either own or you do not. This is perhaps the simplest description of the manner in which they have bootstrapped themselves into dominance - BTC and ETH turn 0s into 1s by incentivizing new users with the strongest value proposition in the world - financial upside. Buy at x, and at some time in the future you’ll have x + y.\n\nViewed from inside the hotel, the manner in which you entered is irrelevant. Check in  at the front desk (*Bitcoin*)? Welcome! You’ll find there is much more to explore. Or perhaps you prefer to operate through the concierge (*Ethereum*)? *Benvenuto*, I love optionality myself. Did the DJ from the pool party (*Dogecoin*) show you in? Nice to see you, I can tell that roller coaster experiences are your idea of a good time. Oh, it was the art wing of the hotel (*NFTs*) that brought you in? You’ll find that we are just getting started.\n\nReality is such that most of the traffic entering the crypto-ecosystem comes via the same on-ramps - the same cryptocurrencies (BTC/ETH) and the same exchanges (Coinbase). But while the entry points may have high similarity, the interior of Hotel Cryptofornia is anything but uniform. In fact, there is a massive “Under Construction” sign in the middle of the front lawn with a progress bar on that shows well below 1% completion.\n\n![We are still \\*very\\* early.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jxdwN9ygNfLTaCdobM67w.gif?height=844&width=1500)\n\nThe interplay between open for business and under construction is a key distinction for what makes crypto so unique in its early stages. Few other industries in history have [sold construction passes to the general public at a higher clip than what is happening in crypto right now.](https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI/status/1396837073202532357?s=20) Anyone, regardless of how old or how wealthy, can can grab a hard hat and get to work in the hotel due to the space’s permissionless nature.\n\nAnd as each new person walks through the door, the base layer of the crypto ecosystem continues to solidify like grains of sand being turned to rock solid concrete. Bitcoin and Ethereum are proxies for the strength of the foundation, and as they continue to assert their dominance the possibility set of future floor plans expands.\n\nHotel Cryptofornia itself represents an intersection between the future and the present, a place that each of us inhabits by nature of walking through its doors. We can participate today in any number of ways - such as buying coins on exchanges like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com), browsing NFTs on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/%5C), or maybe even [sending Bitcoin via the Lightning Network](https://strike.me/en/). And while each of these actions are opportunities to participate in the *economy of now*, they are inherently shaping the *economy of the future* as well.\n\nWhat that economy of the future will look like, however, we can only guess. While each of us can gaze upwards from the ground floor to get an idea of what elevator stops we will be able to make, the clouds begin to obscure our vision the higher we look. In current state, we are merely re-designing the world’s pre-existing infrastructure. We are looking for the decentralized alternatives to Web 2.0 that are enabled by blockchain technology and Web 3.0. Take [BlueSky](https://twitter.com/bluesky?s=20), for example - Jack Dorsey and Twitter’s attempt to create a new standard for decentralized social media. Or [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz) (the site on which this article is published) - the first decentralized publishing platform that is built and run by its contributors.\n\nAs innovative as both of these platforms are, they are both following the same roadmap by leveraging crypto technology to reimagine a Web2 idea - “create the decentralized, Web3 version of the centralized, Web2 platform” (‘skeuomorphic' design’, as coined by Steve Jobs and [adapted to web3 by a16z’s Chris Dixon](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026954086944775?s=20)). But what happens when we start building new floors of the hotel that have no pre-existing blueprint? Through this lens, the outline of the future becomes less clearly defined the higher we look. So while the current construction of Hotel Cryptofornia is nothing short of remarkable, we have much, much more to build. The Google and Facebook moments of the space have yet to arrive. And while I am not sure what they will look like, I am sure that they will change the world in ways that we have never before seen.\n\nBut in order to build the dreams of the future, we must deal with the realities of the present. And one such reality is that in order for the crypto ecosystem to grow and create the future we dream of, more people must come through the door. The good news, however, is that the entryways of Hotel Cryptofornia are as plentiful as they are large. “Permisionless” means that no one will be turned away, and that includes you. Perhaps the doors through which you enter will shape your perceptions and experiences inside, but feel free to enter in any way you like. Because what matters isn’t the way your individual crypto path winds, but simply that the path itself exists. More 1s, less 0s.\n\nSo come one, come all - Hotel Cryptofornia is open for business. Enter however you like and don’t be afraid to explore once you are inside. The floor plan is currently under construction, but with each day you’ll better understand where everything is. Except for the exit, that is, because there’s no such thing to be found. Technology is a one way street and Hotel Cryptofornia is no exception. You can check in any time you like, but you can never leave.", "timestamp": 1635904514, "digest": "5f9dALnFQQX3PLNTNPCwMPSZ_15gdpC4kUxcT8FRnx8", "contributor": "0x5A8F66b24de24e1c829e03c9D3EFD3343064083c"}

The most recent poll by the Washington Post Shar School survey shows McAuliffe up by one percentage point – and that might be all the former governor needs to win this very tight race. \n\nI live in California where polls showed a neck-and-neck recall race between Gov. Gavin Newsom and radio talk show host Larry Elder. In the end, Newsom won by a very healthy margin.\n\n**[ELECTION DAY: VIRGINIA, NEW JERSEY POLLS OPEN IN GOVERNOR'S RACE SEEN AS REFERENDUM ON BIDEN: LIVE](https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/election-day-voters-polls-contests-biden)**\n\nTo be clear, the Virginia race isn’t a recall. Virginia certainly isn’t California. And the candidates couldn’t be more different. \n\n[Video](http://video.foxnews.com/v/6279847819001)\n\n**[JESSICA ANDERSON: IF MCAULIFFE LOSES, HE CAN THANK HIS ARROGANT AND OUT-OF-TOUCH STATEMENTS](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/youngkin-virginia-governor-race-parents-jessica-anderson)** \n  \n But there are some similarities. First, in California, some Democrats worried that there was more enthusiasm on the Republican side among voters, and we see the same worry among Democrats in Virginia. Second, early voting shows a Democrat advantage – more than a million people have voted early and McAuliffe is currently up by about 300,000 votes. But Election Day turnout could turn the tide and will reveal the strength or weakness of the Youngkin campaign. \n\n**[IAN PRIOR: VIRGINIA GOVERNOR'S RACE IS A FIGHT FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/virginia-governor-race-fight-soul-america-ian-prior)**\n\nMcAuliffe has made this race about former President Donald Trump and Youngkin’s alleged similarities. That’s forced Youngkin to try a balancing act: attempting to please the Trump supporters while distancing himself from the former president. Any kind of appearance by Trump might very well hurt Youngkin. In Virginia, one poll indicated voters dislike Trump more than they do President Joe Biden. \n\nFILE – Democratic candidate for governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe dances onstage next to his wife Dorothy, U.S. President Joe Biden, and Democratic Virginia Lt. Gov. candidate Hala Ayala at a rally in Arlington, Virginia, U.S. October 26, 2021. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst (Reuters)\n\nHistorically, Republicans in Virginia have shown higher turnout than Democrats in off-year elections. But there are several factors that could make this year different. Virginia has increased the number of moderate voters in the suburbs and election observers are seeing (in lines waiting to vote) a very strong African American voter presence in some very typically conservative districts (Stafford county, for instance). And Terry McAuliffe has broken the rules of \"history\" once before, in 2013.\n\n**[DAN GAINOR: MEDIA COVERS FOR LINCOLN PROJECT, FAUX REPUBLICANS WHO CAN BE COUNTED ON TO BASH GOP](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/media-covers-lincoln-project-faux-republicans-dan-gainor)**\n\nThis race will also be quite different in ways that could benefit Youngkin. President Joe Biden’s approval ratings have been dropping. Polls show highest disapproval among voters who are Independents – approximately 33% of Virginia’s voting population. What’s more, Youngkin and his campaign have successfully pushed education and the issue of critical race theory to the top of Virginia voters’ concerns.\n\nBut the question here isn’t whether the Democrat wins or not; it’s whether the Democrat wins and by how much. If Terry McAuliffe wins this election by a very close margin, that could have the same impact in the midterm House and Senate races for Democrats as would a loss by McAuliffe. \n\n**[CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER](https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters)**\n\nIn other words, if Virginia’s gubernatorial race determines whether my party retains its majority in the House, it’s looking unlikely. And, it could serve as the poster child for other Republican campaigns in which GOP candidates are looking to unseat Democrats elsewhere.\n\n[Video](http://video.foxnews.com/v/6279831299001)\n\nThis race also has implications that stretch beyond the House of Representatives. Just look at Virginia’s state legislature – both chambers have a Democrat majority and Virginia has had but one Republican governor in the past two decades. So, a win for Youngkin could start a red wave throughout Virginia’s local political races as well.\n\nAs a Democrat, I think the reason this race seems so close is multifaceted. I’d be lying if I said the president’s lower approval ratings aren’t a factor; or that Youngkin seized on the issue of parental rights in schools and critical race theory (even if he has lied that they’re teaching this in \"all\" Virginia public schools, which \"all\" are not). Or that the president’s infrastructure bill has been ripe and ready for passage and that the reconciliation bill still hasn’t passed – largely because of the progressive caucus of my party. Even Speaker Nancy Pelosi admitted that continued delay on the voting of this legislation could threaten McAuliffe’s chances.\n\n**[CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP](https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products)**\n\nThe bottom line is this: win or lose, Democrats could lose a lot of seats due to the closeness of this race. And Republicans will seize upon Youngkin’s formula for success in a purplish-blue state like Virginia and use it as a model for other races throughout the country. \n\nThey say Virginia is for lovers, and today voters will say who they love more for their governor.\n\n**[CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LESLIE MARSHALL](https://www.foxnews.com/person/m/leslie-marshall)**", "timestamp": 1635904662, "digest": "kEJEaq_H6OkvF6Dh8AFdhHmoFBIxaHDAbhGzfSqXc7Y", "contributor": "0x8073DB17391a3781b4a401FD4adA047A0c318a6E"}

Sliwa, on the other hand, has called the 110th mayor-to-be an elitist, as well as Bill de Blasio 2.0.\n\nSliwa, 67, is a well-known, if odd and controversial fixture in the city whose run was considered by a former radio host colleague to be the [latest in a series of media stunts](https://gothamist.com/news/curtis-sliwas-long-strange-sometimes-fabricated-road-to-becoming-a-2021-mayoral-candidate) to gain attention.\n\nHe is best known as the founder of the Guardian Angels, a volunteer anti-crime group that was established in the 1970s during an alarming period of high crime in the city. The group was welcomed by some New Yorkers who felt abandoned and unprotected by the city government at the time. But after surviving a horrific shooting in 1992, Sliwa confessed he'd made up stories of bogus attacks on members of the Guardian Angels and fabricated reports that he'd been abducted by off-duty transit police.\n\nIn his campaign, Sliwa hoped to appeal to voters with an array of proposals that included opposing vaccine mandates and critical race theory in public schools, increasing property taxes on Madison Square Garden, boosting the NYPD's budget and footprint, and converting the mayor's mansion into a cat and dog sanctuary.\n\nAs he went to the polls to vote for himself on Tuesday, Sliwa carried a small kitten in his arms, boasting it is the 17th feline he has adopted with his wife.\n\nIn another mayoral election, in Boston, voters are ushering in the city's first woman and person of color to the helm.\n\nThe candidates are City Councilmembers Michelle Wu and Annissa Essaibi George, both Democrats.

He is also charged with possession of a dangerous weapon by a minor, as he was 17 at the time. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn August last year, Rittenhouse traveled from his home in Antioch, Illinois, armed with an AR-15-style rifle and in response to a Kenosha-based militia calling for protection for businesses against protesters supporting the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRittenhouse is white, as were the two men who died and as is the one who was wounded. Nonetheless, the case has drawn attention from both sides of the political divide over policing and racial injustice.\n\nOn Monday, 12 jurors and eight alternates were selected in an all-day session. The highly contentious trial, which is expected to last approximately two weeks, will determine whether Rittenhouse acted in self-defense or in an intentional act of vigilantism.\n\nThe judge, Bruce Shroeder, said he would decide at the end of the trial which jurors were alternates and which would deliberate.\n\n“There is no magical way for you to evaluate the testimony,” he said on Tuesday. “Instead, you should use your common sense and your experiences in life.”\n\nRittenhouse looked on, dressed in suit and tie and yawning repeatedly.\n\nShroeder said the state must prove by evidence three elements of Rittenhouse’s homicide charges: that the defendant caused the death of another, that the defendant caused the death by criminally reckless conduct, and that the defendant’s conduct showed utter disregard for human life.\n\n“You cannot look into a person’s mind to determine intent, which must be found, if it is to be found at all,” Schroeder said, adding: “Intent should not be confused with motive.”\n\nIn his opening statement, Kenosha county assistant district attorney Thomas Binger portrayed Rittenhouse as an antagonist who chose to exacerbate tensions.\n\n“Like moths to a flame, tourists from outside our community were drawn to the chaos here in Kenosha,” said Binger. “People from outside Kenosha came in and contributed to that chaos.\n\n“The evidence will show that hundreds of people were out on the street experiencing chaos and violence, and the only person who killed anyone was the defendant, Kyle Rittenhouse.”\n\nBinger added: “When we consider the reasonableness of the defendant’s actions, I ask you to keep that in mind. We’re not asking you to solve a mystery in this case.”\n\nRittenhouse’s lead lawyer, Mark Richards, argued that Rittenhouse had close ties to Kenosha as his father lived in the city and he had worked as a lifeguard at a local YMCA.\n\n“Mr Binger makes a big thing out of Kyle Rittenhouse as the only person who shot somebody that evening,” Richards said. “True. Mr Rittenhouse was the only person who was chased by Joseph Rosenbaum that evening.”\n\nRosenbaum was one of the men fatally shot by Rittenhouse, who he chased across a parking lot and at whom he threw a plastic bag.\n\n“The government can refer to \\[Rittenhouse\\] all they wish as an active shooter,” Richards said. “The only person he had shot was Joseph Rosenbuam, who had made threats to kill.\n\n“… Kyle Rittenhouse protected himself, protected his firearm so it couldn’t be taken and used against him or other people from Mr Rosenbaum, who made threats to kill.”\n\nRichards also said “other individuals who didn’t see that shooting attacked \\[Rittenhouse\\] in the street like an animal”.\n\nThe trial continues.", "timestamp": 1635904849, "digest": "dAzUUvBMfqhf2HeDnokDCxtGpEVjMuJSzHLS05nIV-g", "contributor": "0x597dC0Cb1F614AcabBee2715Af3A4c77AA88B2Ba"}

Joe Manchin](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2021/11/02/manchin-spending-bill-comments-panel-harwood-keilar-newday-vpx.cnn). Yet, the West Virginia lawmaker is still [throwing up red flags](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/01/politics/joe-manchin-biden-agenda/index.html) about the size of the proposal and the measures that would pay for it.\n\nAccusing his colleagues of playing \"shell games\" and including \"budget gimmicks,\" Manchin said Monday that \"the real cost\" of the $1.75 trillion bill would be almost twice that amount if its provisions were extended or made permanent. And he said he won't support it without knowing how it would \"impact our debt and our economy and our country.\"\n\nManchin is fuming over one of the main ways the Democrats shrunk the package, which originally totaled $3.5 trillion over 10 years. They shortened the duration of several measures, thereby reducing their cost.\n\n* \n\nFor instance, the[ enhanced child tax credit](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/15/politics/child-tax-credit-stimulus-relief/index.html) would be extended for only one additional year, instead of four. The [beefed-up Affordable Care Act subsidies](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/31/politics/affordable-care-act-subsidies-stimulus-april-1/index.html) would continue only through 2025, instead of being made permanent.\n\n* \n\nIt's a technique used by both Republicans and Democrats, who hope that the measures will prove too popular with the public to let lapse, no matter who controls Congress. The Republicans' 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act contained numerous temporary provisions, with the individual income tax reductions set to expire after 2025.\n\n### Possible permanent extensions\n\nIf all the spending and revenue provisions in the Democrats' budget reconciliation package were made permanent, it would cost nearly $4 trillion over the next decade, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, an independent research group that Manchin has consulted.\n\n[RELATED: Joe Manchin just torpedoed the White House's planned victory lap](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/01/politics/manchin-biden-agenda/index.html)\n\nThe largest expense by far would be the enhanced child tax credit, which provides up to $3,600 a year for each child up to age 6 and $3,000 for each one ages 6 through 17. It would cost more than $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years if made permanent, according to Penn Wharton.\n\nThe beefed-up credit was created by the Democrats' coronavirus relief plan and is currently only in place for 2021. Under the White House framework released last week, the one-year extension of enhancements to the child and earned income tax credits would cost $200 billion.\n\nMaking the expanded earned income tax credit permanent would cost $125 billion, Penn Wharton estimates.\n\nThe more generous Affordable Care Act subsidies would cost $243 billion if they were permanent, instead of the $130 billion estimated by the White House.\n\nAnd the universal pre-school and child care measures would total $700 billion, rather than the $400 billion listed in the White House framework, which calls for only six years of funding.\n\n\"The Democrats right now are saying to Republicans: 'We're going to turn on this universal pre-K and child care. How are you going to turn it off in a couple of years?,'\" said Richard Prisinzano, Penn Wharton's director of policy analysis. \"The Republicans did the same thing, saying, 'We're going to make the individual tax cuts temporary.'\"\n\n### Revenue raisers may fall short\n\nThe White House says that the bill would be fully paid for, estimating that the proposed tax increases on corporations and the wealthy would bring in nearly $2 trillion of new revenue to Uncle Sam over 10 years. But two independent analyses suggest the White House is overestimating how much money those taxes will raise, finding that they won't cover the full cost of the spending plan.\n\n* \n\nBiden confident Joe Manchin will support his spending bill 01:38\n\n[Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates](https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/estimates/2021/10/28/white-house-reconciliation-revenue-package) the bill would raise about $1.5 trillion over 10 years and the right-leaning [Tax Foundation found](https://taxfoundation.org/build-back-better-plan-reconciliation-bill-tax/) it would raise $1.2 trillion over the same time period. In both cases, the bill would fall short of fully funding the $1.75 trillion plan and ultimately add billions of dollars to the deficit.\n\n* \n\nBoth analyses found that the proposed 15% minimum book tax on large corporations and the 1% tax on stock buybacks -- two of the biggest proposed revenue raisers -- wouldn't bring in nearly as much money as the White House predicts.\n\nThey both also expect that the proposal to beef up IRS enforcement to ensure that high-earning Americans are paying what they owe would result in less revenue than the $400 billion the White House claims. [An earlier report](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57444) from the Congressional Budget Office said that the proposal would raise half that amount over 10 years.", "timestamp": 1635904896, "digest": "NJXTO3vNH-LR8GMX1B6p-oMj5NwWb1uFAbUvD3hbFlY", "contributor": "0x8545f0833b3238480B8e72e22fC0E69Fa84d1cf2"}

It's unclear if a court would rule that MetaPC and Facebook are in the same wheelhouse though, given their vastly different businesses. \n\nThe filings haven't been approved - the filings are still listed as \"live\" - meaning Meta PC doesn't own the \"Meta\" brand just yet. Still, it did file its petition a full two months before Facebook announced its rebrand - meaning the tech giant could face a legal battle, even if it's in the form of patent trolling. \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1635904938, "digest": "CsPk6fLkQpe5HoLlYiifPMSU5W8rOy5N4ksobmIQMig", "contributor": "0xeeF8d0F4c1D7Cd87B0d7D9eb5cDe356985B922Ce"}

In [an op-ed for the ](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-11-01/ucsb-megadorm-santa-barbara-charles-munger-design)*[Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-11-01/ucsb-megadorm-santa-barbara-charles-munger-design)*[,](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-11-01/ucsb-megadorm-santa-barbara-charles-munger-design) McFadden explained why, calling the building “a misguided experiment that will affect the health and safety of multiple generations of undergraduates who will be forced to negotiate the design’s gross miscalculations and unintended consequences.”\n\nMany were quick to agree. Architecture critic Paul Goldberger [called](https://twitter.com/paulgoldberger/status/1453921647736541187?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1453927747277840388%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.curbed.com%2F2021%2F10%2Fyes-build-the-windowless-uc-santa-barbara-dorm-in-my-yard.html) the proposed building a “jail masquerading as a dorm.” Others [likened](https://twitter.com/profmusgrave/status/1454072429509218304?s=20) it to a “human rights violation.” \n\n[More from](https://www.bloomberg.com/citylab?in_source=postr_index)\n\n[Who Gets to Be Mayor?

This would transform a corner of the UCSB campus into the eighth-densest neighborhood on the planet. Students would get small bedrooms, with eight units sharing a kitchen and bathroom. Much of the building is reserved for common study, dining and recreation areas. Instead of windows and natural light, most interior rooms would be lit only by porthole-like fixtures. Parking is strictly limited to bicycles.\n\nAt $1.5 billion — a mind-boggling per-unit cost of $330,687 — the dorm is partially [funded](https://www.wsj.com/articles/buffett-partner-charlie-munger-has-a-side-gig-designing-college-dorms-11556807102) by its mastermind, billionaire investor Charlie Munger, who donated $200 million to the university, with the caveat that his building design must be followed. A vice chairman at [Berkshire Hathaway Inc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BRK%7CA:US). with a side passion for architecture, the 97-year-old businessman has made similar arrangements at other schools, including Stanford and the University of Michigan. The residence hall for Michigan graduate students that Munger helped fund and design is among the more [popular](https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1454201794620375042) housing options on campus. \n\nAnd if you can get past its monolithic [city-in-a-cube](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-10/one-planet-one-city-one-building) scale, bring the costs down, and hammer out minor issues like fire safety and what to do if the power goes out, Dormzilla is *fine*. \n\nIt’s perhaps best understood as an extreme but necessary response to the deepening student housing crisis that [leaves](http://transformschools.ucla.edu/stateofcrisis/) one in 20 UC students homeless. As KCRW [reported](https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/greater-la/van-life-street-medicine-shirley-raines/ucsb-housing-students?utm_campaign=gla&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=kcrw-tweet&utm_content=gla-ucsb-housing-students), the problem is especially acute at UCSB, where many students have taken to sleeping in cars and crashing on couches, if not dropping out altogether. The university could [soon face legal penalties](https://www.independent.com/2021/06/30/as-ucsb-grows-it-falls-way-behind-on-building-housing/) if it doesn’t build more student housing. Dormzilla would help to solve that.\n\nSay what you will about Munger’s architecture chops, but the man has a plan.\n\nNor are the proposed living standards particularly egregious. Dormzilla’s units may lack windows, but each student gets a private room with a desk, bed and space for personal belongings. (Down at the University of California, Los Angeles, many undergraduates sleep three to a room on bunk beds, and pay [handsomely](https://portal.housing.ucla.edu/my-housing/rates-contracts-rules/2020-2021-residential-suite-plaza-triple-room-shared-bath-rates) for the privilege.) And for all the [stink](https://twitter.com/jbarro/status/1454208400531853316?s=20) that has been made over four students sharing a bathroom, this is hardly an unusual [ratio](https://thehostelhelper.com/hostel-bathroom/) for communal living. It may not sound dreamy, but it beats living in a car.\n\n“It’s a game of tradeoffs,” [Munger told ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-29/charlie-munger-defends-design-for-dorm-bashed-by-architect)*[Bloomberg News](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-29/charlie-munger-defends-design-for-dorm-bashed-by-architect)*. “If you build a big square building, everything is conveniently near to everybody in the building. If you maximize the light, you get fewer people in the building.”\n\nIndeed, say what you will about Munger’s architecture chops, but the man has a plan: With its sparse private accommodations and lavish public spaces, the building is conceived to coax students out of their rooms and into the community. That was once understood to be the entire point of the more-spartan dormitories of the past. You go there to sleep and shower, but otherwise, you’re out and about on campus. With many new student residences resembling [luxury apartments](https://www.uky.edu/housing/residence-halls/woodland-glen-ii) — with astronomical boarding fees to boot — Munger’s design is an earnest, if outlandish, attempt to return to that vision of dorm life.\n\nCities are changing fast.

Like moving into Munger Hall, choosing a dense urban environment over a suburban one often means settling for a cramped apartment and giving up your car, yard and a measure of privacy. In exchange, the restaurants are your dining room, the libraries your office, the bars your parlor, the theater your entertainment room, and the public parks your lawn. In other housing contexts — see Los Angeles’ inward-looking [bungalow courts](https://archive.curbed.com/2020/6/23/21294285/bungalow-court-los-angeles-history) — urbanists rightly pine for this space-efficient style of communal living. Is Dormzilla really so different?\n\nOf course, the root cause of this student housing crisis — the reason the university finds itself needing a behemoth like Dormzilla — is the [refusal](https://www.pacificresearch.org/ceqa-holds-up-affordable-housing-student-housing/) of UCSB’s neighbors to allow housing construction. Like so many towns and cities in California, the communities around the university are in the thrall of single-family zoning policies that make multifamily developments all but impossible, forcing students and staff to either live far from campus or pay inflated housing prices. In neighboring Goleta, a segregationist zoning code [bans](https://nebula.wsimg.com/674d8d671f7ed1ef6387b66b49f353eb?AccessKeyId=8B11547F66E8794DD29E&disposition=0&alloworigin=1) apartments nearly citywide, while in unincorporated Isla Vista, densities are strictly [capped](http://www.goletazoning.com/documents.html) at 20 units per acre. The city of Santa Barbara has [permitted](https://housingdata.app/places/CA/Santa%20Barbara) fewer than 500 apartments over the past half-decade — half as many units as down-and-out Detroit built last year — despite enormous demand. (For further context: Each *floor* of Munger Hall would have more than 500 units.) \n\nTo go out on a limb, Dormzilla is hardly a perfect project. Its [location](https://twitter.com/alfred_twu/status/1454173132374220800?s=20) on the periphery of campus is far from ideal. Its costs are comically high, even by California [standards](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/us/California-housing-costs.html). The long corridors seem dreary and repetitive. It’s not the dorm that I — or evidently many other people, trained architects or otherwise — would design. \n\nBut when you follow housing fights for long enough, you start to realize that there are a million reasons to oppose every new development. This building requires more facade articulation or fewer stories; that one lacks yards and parking. The NIMBY impulse is an unlimited renewable resource, forever coming up with superficially convincing reasons for why nothing should ever be built anywhere. The only way to overcome it is to remain true to one simple fact: We need housing. If we made it easier to build, there would be more to go around. And perhaps some of those new apartments could even come with windows.  \n  \n *M.

The seat that was vacated by former Rep. [Marcia Fudge ](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/10/politics/marcia-fudge-confirmed-hud-secretary/index.html)who became President Joe Biden's secretary of housing and urban development earlier this year.\n\nCNN projected Brown's win over Republican candidate Laverne Gore, on Tuesday.\n\nBrown's victory is not expected to impact the balance of power for the US House of Representatives, where Democrats hold a slim 3-seat majority. That's because Ohio is having another special election in the 15th congressional district to fill the seat of GOP Rep. Steve Stivers, who resigned earlier this year. That district is considered safely Republican, and GOP Rep. Mike Carey is expected to win Tuesday.\n\nA native of Cleveland, Brown worked in marketing prior to jumping into politics and created a printing company to support small businesses. In 2012, she became a member of Warrensville Heights City Council and was elected chair of the Cuyahoga County Democratic party in 2017, becoming the first woman and Black American in the position.\n\nShe campaigned on working to stem gun violence by supporting gun safety measures, including banning firearm sales to those convicted of domestic violence or a hate crime. Brown also committed to ensuring equity among Covid-19 relief efforts and maternal health.\n\nGore, also a native of Cleveland and a businesswoman, campaigned on reducing welfare, promoting police training and improving the illiteracy rate. She launched an unsuccessful bid against Fudge in the 2020 election and lost by 60 percentage points.\n\nBrown was a favorite to win the seat in the heavily Democratic, Cleveland-based district where President Joe Biden won 80% of the vote. She defeated Nina Turner, a close ally of Vermont Sen.

The planned evictions in Sheikh Jarrah were a key flashpoint in the leadup to the 11-day May conflict between Israel and the Hamas terror group in the Gaza Strip.\n\nA lawyer for Nahalat Shimon did not respond to requests for comment. Publicly available filings indicated that the group had also submitted a response to the court, though its content has not been published.\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Editionby email and never miss our top stories\n\nNewsletter email addressGET IT\n\nBy signing up, you agree to the [terms](https://www.timesofisrael.com/terms)\n\nThe four Sheikh Jarrah homes under discussion were built on land owned by Jews before the 1948 Israeli War of Independence, when they were seized by Jordan and leased to Palestinian families. After Israel captured the area in the 1967 Six Day War, a 1970 Israeli law transferred all abandoned properties still held by the Jordanian government, including the Sheikh Jarrah homes, to the custody of the Israeli government.\n\nThe law further obligated the release of properties to the original owners when possible. The Jewish trusts that owned the site appealed for its return to their hands, sparking decades of legal battles with Palestinian residents who vowed to stay put.\n\nIn late April and early May of this year — as a potentially definitive court date approached — Sheikh Jarrah became a battleground. The neighborhood saw repeated clashes between Israeli riot police and Palestinian demonstrators. The spiraling tensions contributed to the escalation in Jerusalem that touched off the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to Ir Amim, a left-wing human rights group focusing on Jerusalem, around 200 families in East Jerusalem are under similar threat of eviction, with cases slowly moving through administrative bodies and Israeli courts.\n\nPalestinian residents of the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah and European diplomats attend a hearing regarding their eviction from their homes at the Supreme Court in Jerusalem on August 2, 2021. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\n\nIn early October, the Supreme Court published a compromise proposal: The Palestinians would be allowed to remain as protected tenants and Nahalat Shimon would be provisionally recognized as the owner of the land on which the homes were built.\n\nUnder the compromise, the Palestinians would pay NIS 2,400 ($763) in annual rent to Nahalat Shimon. Palestinian residents would also have to pay some of Nahalat Shimon’s legal fees, which the court set at NIS 30,000 ($9,308).\n\nThe Palestinians, who see the homes as rightfully theirs, have refused to recognize Nahalat Shimon’s ownership of the homes. The Jewish organization has said that it will not agree to any compromise in which Palestinians do not acknowledge their ownership.\n\nThe High Court had sought to find a middle ground: Nahalat Shimon would be recognized as the owners. But the Palestinians would not forfeit their right to seek to have the question of ownership reopened by the Justice Ministry, as their attorneys have long sought.\n\nThe court’s compromise would have specifically given Palestinians extra protections beyond the letter of the law. Protected tenancy can be stripped for various reasons — such as urban renewal projects or should residents make changes to the homes. The deal specifically ruled out evicting Palestinians for those reasons.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMoreover, Nahalat Shimon would pledge not to initiate any legal proceedings that could evict the Palestinian residents for at least 15 years, or until the struggle over the property’s ownership had been independently resolved.\n\nThe compromise offer split the Palestinian families, who were unable to reach a consensus for weeks.\n\n“There were extensive discussions. We’ve spent a month talking it over, every single day. Now we’ve reached a decision to reject it,” said Abdelfattah Eskafi, one of the Palestinians threatened with eviction.\n\nPalestinians and left-wing activists protest against the eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, on April 16, 2021. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\n\nResidents faced overwhelming external pressure to reject the deal, with both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas decrying the proposal.\n\nHamas chief Ismail Haniyeh held a phone call with the Sheikh Jarrah families last week calling on them to refuse the proposal.\n\n“We will not allow the occupation courts to extract by trickery what they were unable to extract in a war. You do not need to deal with their offers, as they are an illegal entity on our land,” Haniyeh said, according to his office.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, PA President Mahmoud Abbas’s adviser on Jerusalem affairs Ahmad al-Ruweidi also told residents not to take the deal during a press conference in Sheikh Jarrah.", "timestamp": 1635905254, "digest": "N3n-BEp2WJtwL56J_krCevI91P7N2UfM4-b0QqpQZKs", "contributor": "0xa5A313A41968f058EF5C36ddC1891B51fF57caAD"}

The new AirPods Pro themselves remain unchanged. What got tweaked is the case they come in. The case now supports MagSafe charging.\n\nAirPods Pro have always supported wireless charging, but these incorporate Apple’s MagSafe technology. That means when you set them on a MagSafe charger, they stick to it and stay in place magnetically. This makes it easy to know when they’re in place to receive a wireless charge, and it makes them less likely to be bumped off the charger. You do need Apple’s MagSafe charger to take advantage of this new feature, however ([see it at Amazon](https://zdcs.link/bl0Me?_ga=668900025.1635905462)).\n\nAside from that, these are the same as the model they’re replacing. They’re still excellent wireless earbuds, though. They still have active noise canceling with a pass-through mode. They come with replaceable rubber tips you can swap out to find the right size for your ears. They also have touch controls built into their stems, and they pair seamlessly with your Apple products like iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\n\n[close dialog](javascript:void(0))\n\nLET US DO THE WORK FOR YOU.\n\nGet Daily Deals delivered directly to your inbox\n\nevery morning\n\nSign Me Up\n\nNo, thanks\n\n\n---\n\n*Chris Reed is a deals expert and commerce editor for IGN.

Amazon's effort [fizzled and died less than two years later](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/05/amazons-actually-free-app-store-didnt-actually-last-for-two-years/).\n\n## Sharing your account? No problem\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n[Netflix once again introduces new features for Android, but not iOS (yet)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/new-netflix-mobile-app-feature-allows-viewing-partially-downloaded-videos/)\n\nToday's announcement includes no mention of a certain megaton Apple smartphone and tablet ecosystem; instead, you have to look at[the official \"Netflix Geeked\" Twitter account](https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1455580571959054341)to be assured that iOS support for Netflix Games is \"on the way.\" As[we previously confirmed](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/the-shape-of-netflix-gaming-is-smartphone-only-debuts-via-test-in-poland/), the credential-checking system in place on Android should translate neatly to iOS whenever Netflix Games gets around to launching there. (This certainly isn't the first time[Netflix has rolled out new, interesting features on Android before iOS](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/new-netflix-mobile-app-feature-allows-viewing-partially-downloaded-videos/).)\n\n![An example of how Netflix Games' interface will look inside the normal Netflix app on Android starting on Wednesday, November 3.](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Android_Collage_1920x1080__UCAN_En-980x551.jpg)\n\nOnce Netflix's Android app update goes live tomorrow, it will allow users to stay within the Netflix app, find each game as an individual download, and confirm Netflix credentials before loading the games. While Netflix says some of its games will need to check in with a server every time you play, I've confirmed that some of the launch games can work in fully offline mode—at least, after logging in and confirming Netflix credentials before fully closing each game, putting your smartphone into airplane mode, and loading the games again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking of flexibility, if your Netflix account supports multiple, simultaneous logins (like the United States' $17.99/month \"4K\" plan), Netflix Games will work the same way. Everyone can log in and simultaneously play games until an account's \"maximum devices\" limit is reached. At that point, the app will dish out alerts the same way it does with video account sharing. And while all of the games so far are kid-friendly (especially as they have no microtransactions), games are currently listed as \"adult\" content and thus require either an adult account or PIN code access.\n\nToday's slate of games looks like the fare you'd expect from an ex-Zynga executive running this newly established Netflix Games category. But that exec, Mike Verdu, insists there's more to come. \"Just like our series, films, and specials, we want to design games for any level of play and every kind of player, whether you’re a beginner or a lifelong gamer,\" he wrote in today's announcement.

If you ask me, once Hollywood got taken over by the executives, it went straight down the toilet,” [she told Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/prop-master-martin-cathy-scorsese-rust-shooting-2021-11) of the filmmaking industry that has become undermined by budgets to a dangerous degree. While she did not work on the film, she blamed long shifts, extreme pressure and cost-cutting measures for making situations like the one on the “Rust” set not uncommon.\n\nDirector Martin Scorsese with his wife Helen Morris and daughter Cathy Scorsese at the 77th annual Academy Awards in Hollywood, February 27, 2005.\n\nREUTERS\n\n“Amid the talk of hiring a nonunion crew and then pushing them beyond their limits and cutting corners to try and save money, it seems they screwed up pretty badly,” she said of “Rust.”\n\nWhile her personal experience with Baldwin has been positive, as a producer of the movie, she believes he could be even more significantly to blame.\n\n## SEE ALSO\n\n### Alec Baldwin seen at New Mexico hotel with Halyna Hutchins’ husband, son\n\n“I worked with Alec Baldwin on the set of ‘The Departed’ and ‘The Aviator.’ Alec is a good human being, and it’s [written all over his face](https://nypost.com/2021/10/30/alec-baldwin-breaks-silence-on-fatal-shooting-of-halyna-hutchins-on-rust-set/) how distraught he is. It’s awful, but in addition to his role as an actor, he’s also wearing the producer hat in this case,” she said.\n\n“The number of violations that took place to result in a death and an injury like this is beyond our comprehension,” she added, speaking on behalf of other industry colleagues who’ve been “blowing up” online message boards discussing “how this could have possibly happened when the chain of custody on set for firearms is so specific and strict.” \n\nShe hopes the incident will perhaps elicit some change.\n\n“For years, I’ve been saying there’s got to be a better way to make movies, and everybody’s attitude is, ‘Well, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’ But it is broke.

The Sandbox 本来是传统的区块链游戏，从 2018 年开始探索区块链版本，团队具有丰富的游戏开发和运营营销经验，在过去 2 年多的时间能够交付设定的目标和任务；\n2. The Sandbox 的控股公司 Animoca Brands 旗下有多个区块链游戏子公司 / 团队，控股公司可以对子公司经营提供支持和帮助；\n3. 从团队运营至今，合作的伙伴包括 Atari 等比较知名的游戏开发商，并且和多个知名 IP 合作。与 IP 联名有机会吸引非区块链用户，达到「出圈」的效果，营销能力比较强；\n4. 已有产品的用户体验都比较友好。\n\nThe Sandbox 的经济模型设计比较合理，与龙头 Decentraland 相比，The Sandbox 在设计机制上有改进和创新点。\n\n1. 任何人都可以创建和出售 The Sandbox 的 NFT 资产和游戏，增加了普通用户的获利方式，可以扩大了用户群体；\n2. NFT 资产增加了确定属性和稀有度，需要质押 SAND 或使用 SAND 购买获得，扩展了 NFT 的玩法；\n3. 基金会的资产未来将通过 Play-to-Earn 等流动性挖矿方式回馈给游戏用户，增加经济激励，能够吸引潜在用户。\n\nThe Sandbox 目前还处于开发中，最终虚拟世界 / 沙盒世界还未面世，很多玩法都还是书面计划，实际效果要在正式实施时才能知晓结果。玩家目前只可以使用 Game Maker、VoxEdit 创作 NFT 和游戏，也可以在 GameMaker 中探索界面，但虚拟世界入口暂未开放，团队已在 10 月宣布即将开放 The Sandbox Alpha 入口点 Mainhub。\n\n由于 The Sandbox 还处于发展早期，根据同类产品 Decentraland 的发展历史，我们需要关注以下几点：\n\n1. 虚拟现实平台普遍存在的问题是土地所有权和创造权的分离，以及 NFT 市场存在很大的人为炒作成分。购买了大量土地的人可能没有意愿花费大量精力构建内部生态，而有意愿 / 能力创作的人没有土地而无法丰富生态，从而导致了虚拟现实平台内部有大部份土地空缺，The Sandbox 也可能会出现这种情况，这会影响用户体验，导致用户留存率难以提高。\n2. 虚拟现实的经济模式还在探索中，没有真正发展起来。就目前已有的沙盒游戏来看，用户量提升比较困难，除了代币升值引起土地价格提高，土地持有者很难获得额外收益，这也会降低用户对土地等 NFT 的购买意愿。\n\n总体来说，The Sandbox 值得关注。\n\n*说明：头等仓最终评定的【关注】/【不关注】，是按照头等仓项目评估框架对项目当前基本面进行综合分析的结果，而非对项目代币未来价格涨跌的预测。影响代币价格的因素众多，项目基本面并非唯一因素，因此，不可因为研报判定为【不关注】，就认为项目价格一定会跌。此外，区块链项目的发展是动态的，被我们判定为【不关注】的项目，若其基本面发生重大的积极变化，我们将有可能会调整为【关注】，同样地，被我们判定为【关注】的项目，若发生重大恶性改变，我们将会警示所有会员，并有可能会调整为【不关注】。*\n\n### 基本概况\n\n#### 项目简介\n\nThe Sandbox 想要创建一个基于区块链的沙盒游戏 / 虚拟世界 / 游戏平台。在这个平台上，玩家可以使用代币来创建自己的游戏，并从中获利。\n\n产品：VoxEdit （NFT 编辑器）、Marketplace （交易市场）、Game Maker （土地 / 游戏编辑器）。\n\n通证经济：代币简称 SAND，用于交易、治理等。\n\n#### 基本信息\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The Sandbox](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/456f6a1ecc665d3e90f9798c0d272cb3.png-article)\n\n### 项目详解\n\n#### 团队\n\n**背景信息**\n\nThe Sandbox 的最初开发商为 Pixowl，2012 年发布传统沙盒游戏 The Sandbox，曾被 Apple 评选为 2012 年最佳游戏之一，但后续发展不如《我的世界》。2018 年 Pixowl 被 Animoca Brands 收购并成为其子公司，开始以 Voxel （体素）风格开发区块链版本 The Sandbox。The Sandbox 目前仍由 Pixowl 原团队成员进行开发。\n\nAnimoca Brands 由萧逸于 2014 年在澳大利亚创建，总部在香港，2015 年曾在澳大利亚证券交易所上市，2020 年 3 月由于参与加密货币有关活动等原因被澳大利亚证券交易所退市，但公司的经营活动正常，股票交易通过二级交易中心实现。Animoca Brands 投资或合作的公司包括：Pixowl （The Sandbox 团队），TicBits，nWay，iCandy Interactive，Sky Mavis （Axie Infinity 团队），Dapper Labs （CryptoKitties 团队），TSB 游戏，GAMEE，Tribeflame，Stryking Entertainment，Lucid Sight，Quidd，Experimental Group 和 Skytree。F1 Delta Time 区块链赛车游戏（代币简称 REVV）也为该公司开发的游戏之一。\n\nPixowl 游戏工作室曾经开发的游戏包括《Peanuts：Snoopy’s Town Tale》、《Garfield：Survival of the Fattest》和《Goosebumps Horror Town》等。在收购前，The Sandbox 有约 4,000 万历史下载量。\n\n综上，The Sandbox 的原团队已经有比较丰富的开发经验和游戏运营经验，并且被收购后，可以获得母公司的支持和帮助。\n\n**核心团队**\n\n官网显示核心团队 29 人，团队主要人员包括管理（4 名）、游戏开发和游戏设计（21 名）、营销运营（4 名）。\n\nArthur Madrid，联合创始人兼 CEO，2011 年创建 Pixowl。Pixowl 被收购后成为 Animoca Brands 董事会成员。\n\nSebastien Borget，联合创始人兼首席运营官，获得南巴黎国立电信学校计算机网络与电信专业学士学位，香港中文大学计算机网络与电信专业硕士学位。2004 年至 2011 年间先后就职于摩托罗拉、巴黎 Wixi 媒体等公司，任项目技术经理。2011 年加入 Pixowl。\n\nMarcelo Santurio，首席财务总监，1998 年毕业于伦敦商学院，毕业后任职波士顿银行经理助理，两年后和别人联合创建了拉丁美洲在线支付方案 Segulink.com。2018 年加入 The Sandbox。\n\nLucas Shrewsbury，首席技术官（CTO）。前 Gameloft 首席技术官，Gameloft 是一家世界著名的开发和发行基于移动设备的视频游戏的跨国公司，其开发的大型游戏多次获得国际性大奖，其总部位于法国。\n\n**顾问**\n\nEd Fries，Xbox 的创始人之一。Xbox 是微软创建的视频游戏品牌，包含 5 个开发部门。Ed Fries 在微软任职期间是 Xbox 的主要负责人之一。Fries 于 2001 年离开微软，随后自己创建了一家公司 Fire Ant 并出售给索尼互动娱乐公司。自 2015 年之后，开始担任 Ouya （基于安卓的游戏开发平台）和 Animoca 的顾问。\n\nAlexis Bonte，[Stillfron](https://www.stillfront.com/en/our-studios/) 集团首席运营官兼管理团队人员，Stillfron 集团旗下游戏工作室 eRepublik Labs 的联合创始人兼首席执行官。Stillfron 是一群游戏开发商、发行商组成的集团，旗下有 18 个子公司 / 游戏工作室，主要市场针对德国、美国、法国、英国、中东和北非。\n\nYat Siu （萧逸），Animoca Brands 联合创始人兼首席执行官。\n\nMick Nayeem，CryptoKitties 和 Axiom Zen 合伙人。\n\n**基金会**\n\n基金会支持 The Sandbox 生态系统发展，基金会的资金作为奖励激励用户 / 创作者 / 投资者在平台上创作高质量的内容和游戏。基金会发布的第一个活动是游戏创作者基金，活动从 2019 年 10 月至 2020 年 8 月，希望通过经济激励在 The Sandbox 生态内创建 100 个游戏。资助的游戏可获得 4,000\\~30,000 美元的补助金。截至 2021 年 1 月，该资助的游戏约 20 个，无详细信息。根据团队披露，基金会的地址由 The Sandbox 核心成员 2/3 多签管理，具体成员未披露。根据团队披露信息，基金会将于 2021 年向 DAO 转移。\n\n基金会 /DAO 资金主要来源：\n\n1. 土地拍卖的 25% 资金；\n2. 市场手续费的 50%；\n3. 代币分配。\n\n#### 资金\n\n团队的资金来源主要是代币销售。\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The Sandbox](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/ef835e7e56bd536184118b0677a58c24.png-article)\n\n注：\n\n私募轮：白皮书中表明 2019 年期间共 14 名投资者参与私募轮，共筹集 341 万美元。（在 One Page 介绍中称私募轮获得 421 万美元融资。）无法确定私募轮是否出售代币和股权。这部分融资金额可能包含 2019 年 5 月由 Hashed 牵头获得的 250 万美元投资。根据媒体消息，除币安披露的战略轮融资外，2020 年 3 月获得了 201 万美元的战略融资，投资机构包括 Square Enix，B Cryptos，True Global Ventures，共 201 万美元。\n\n2021 年 11 月 2 日，根据路透社消息，The Sandbox 完成 9,300 万美元融资，软银 Vison Fund2 领投。\n\n因此，The Sandbox 共筹集约 1.03 亿美元\\~1.13 亿美元之间。2021 年之前的完成的约 1,000 万美元融资，团队表明将 45% 资金用于开发团队和平台基础设施建设支出，45% 用于市场营销和 IP 合作，7% 用于法务等支出，3% 用于一般支出。\n\n#### 代码\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The Sandbox](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/e92880e2ab8c50e8af81481eca4fb2a3_zw8kTca.png-article)\n\n代码提交人数在 4 人左右，从 2018 年 1 月至 2021 年 1 月，代码提交总次数约 400 次。相较一般开源项目，提交量较少。但我们要注意的是，以公司形式运行的项目通常是先组内开发和内测，最后再进行一次性代码提交，因此代码提交数和提交人数会比较少。我们能够得出的结论是：团队的开发工作一直在进行中。\n\n#### 框架\n\nThe Sandbox 是基于以太坊区块链的去中心化虚拟现实平台，类似于传统的沙盒游戏《我的世界》和《迷你世界》。虚拟世界是由一块块土地构成的世界。根据下图，我们可以看出土地是 The Sandbox 的底层，整个基于土地形成一系列玩法和经济体系。\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The Sandbox](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/73f089c222425c67808f24d336bf2a96_eMrCLqq.png-article)\n\n**土地层**\n\nThe Sandbox 一共有 166,464 块土地，123,840 块地可出售，25,920 块作为奖励分配给合作伙伴、创造者、玩家，The Sandbox 保留 16,704 块地作为举办活动和游戏的场所。\n\n每块土地都是基于 ERC-721 标准的 NFT 代币，通过（x,y）坐标确定每块土地的唯一性。多块土地组合变成 ESTATE。土地最基础的用途是在土地上部署内容，从而影响和改变世界。持有土地的用户可以通过部署游戏、场馆收取门票、租赁土地等方式获得收益，构建一个以土地为基础的经济体系（目前还未搭建完成）。\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The Sandbox](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/bc2dcdc4940d55e8b8ac59fc6569d284_JdNnnf5.png-article)\n\n注：黑色部分为不可用部分，包含剩余未拍卖部分和团队保留的公共空间。\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The Sandbox](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/62c423e9e1e757538611182c23705c62_7CO1ey0.png-article)\n\n* 2021 年的土地拍卖通常 LAND 售价为 1,011 SAND，Premium LAND 售价 4,683 SAND，ESTATE 销售方式为拍卖。截至 2021 年 11 月底，The Sandbox 共出售 / 发放超过 60%，接下来 8 个月将出售 / 发放剩余的土地。部分交易数据未披露。\n* 土地拍卖所得资金 50% 属于公司储备资金，锁定 6 个月；25% 属于公司金库，锁定 12 个月；25% 属于基金会。公司储备资金的具体用途未标明。公司金库的 SAND 代币将在解锁后卖出，以支付公司的运营费用。基金会资金通过流动性挖矿、Play-to-Earn （玩游戏得奖励）的方式返还给 The Sandbox 用户。\n* 从 4.2 轮开始使用 SAND 代币参与拍卖，不再接受 ETH/DAI。\n* 4.3 轮由于技术原因分为 2 次进行拍卖，上述为 4.3 轮第一次拍卖出售土地块数和筹集资金，本次所得资金全部转入基金会。4.3 轮的第 2 次拍卖已经完成，拍卖了 5,518 块土地。\n\n**内容层**\n\nNFT 资产需要通过 VoxEdit 创建，游戏或者场景通过 Game Maker 创建，详情查看 2.5。\n\n在 The Sandbox 的设计中，内容层包含 NFT 资产、游戏、服务订阅、广告等内容。在构建 NFT 资产时，需要用到 GEM 和 Catalyst 这 2 种 ERC-20 代币，都需要使用 SAND 代币购买或通过在系统中质押 SAND 代币获得。GEM 代币决定 NFT 资产的稀有程度，Catalyst 决定 NFT 资产的属性。GEM 和 Catalyst 需要通过质押 SAND 才能够获得。NFT 资产基于 ERC-721 或 ERC-1155，内容都存储在 IPFS 网络中。\n\n目前团队通过经济激励刺激艺术家参与，为 The Sandbox 创建 NFT 资产。基金会也推出了游戏创作者资助计划，为生态内增加可用游戏。The Sandbox 合作的游戏商 / 游戏平台包括：Atari、Ultra、CryptoKitties、韩国 SBS 游戏学院、游戏公司 Square Enix 等等。\n\n**玩家层**\n\n玩家在虚拟世界中都有一个虚拟的形象，称为 Avatar。目前系统中已创建好的虚拟形象共 27 个，用户可选择已有的形象也可以在市场中购买别人创建的虚拟形象。\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The Sandbox](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/62a81b7ec95c5769be5337a83d8e6ff1.png-article)\n\n#### 产品\n\n**Marketplace （市场）**\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The Sandbox](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/b19032eddec65219baa5106308e00d6e.png-article)\n\n市场内将资产分为 NFT 资产、土地、ESTATE 三类。NFT 资产又进一步按照稀有度、类别、主题等进行分类，以便用户查找。稀有度分为 4 个级别，分别是：常见、罕见、史诗和传奇。土地和 Estate 暂未在市场中列出。目前市场交易费是 5%，其中 50% 归属基金会，50% 归属于 Staking 池，反馈给玩家和 SAND 持有者。\n\n**VoxEdit**\n\nVoxEdit 是 NFT 编辑器，采用 3D 体素的方式建模。所谓的体素就是一个个的方块，通过组合方块搭建出自己想要的图形。用户可以使用这个软件包创建 3D NFT。VoxEdit 支持一个骨骼系统，用户可以先搭建出物体的骨架，然后搭建动画层，使创建出的骨架旋转和缩放等，变成动画。VoxEdit 导出的作品格式为（.vxm 和 .vxr）以及标准格式（.obj、.dae、.gltf）。目前发布了 Windows 和 Mac OS 桌面版本，支持中文、英语、日语、韩语共 4 种语言。骨架的搭建部分比较简单，但动画部分稍难。\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The

500\\~1,000 人次之间。推特博文的互动量平均在 50 人左右。Discord 论坛比较活跃。官方在推特、Discord、Facebook 和 medium 上的博文推送的比较频繁。运营活动比较多，内容都是项目方最新进展。\n\n**合作伙伴**\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The Sandbox](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/b1a41b1404785ee5b56b694336905ccc_Ab5uYWj.png-article)\n\nThe Sandbox 的主要合作伙伴包括一些游戏开发商和联名品牌等，包括游戏巨头 Atari、桌上游戏网站 BGA 等，联名品牌包括小羊肖恩、蓝精灵等。除此外，The Sandbox 和 Polygon Network 达成合作，市场交易使用其二层网络。上图中还包括一些 NFT 交易市场或信息聚合网站，包括 Nonfungible、Dapp Review 等。合作方比较多，且关联性高。\n\n总结：\n\n1）团队的开发能力比较强。① The Sandbox 的团队成员原来就是开发传统的沙盒游戏，有比较成熟的游戏开发和运营经验；② The Sandbox 的控股公司旗下有多个区块链游戏，对子公司能够提供一定支持和帮助；③ 团队的核心产品能够在较短的时间内发布桌面客户端，和同类游戏相比开发进度比较快，并且产品体验感不错。\n\n2）团队的营销和运营能力不错。① The Sandbox 项目方经常举办内容创建、游戏创建激励活动，鼓励社区参与设计，鼓励用户参与生态；② 团队的合作方都是比较知名的游戏商或 IP，运营能力比较强。\n\n3）基金会将会在 2021 年逐渐转向 DAO 治理，资金将会通过各种活动回馈给社区，能够起到引流作用，吸引更多人加入 The Sandbox。团队的营收信息比较透明，但没有披露支出的具体信息。由于土地拍卖获得的代币很大一部分代币归属于公司，后续会出售给市场，因此可能会造成一定的抛压。\n\n### 发展\n\n#### 历史\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The Sandbox](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/b1c32125803f525cbee5a114d54c7513.png-article)\n\n#### 现状\n\n2021 年第四季度，项目主要进展包括：\n\n1. 完成了 9,300 万美元 B 轮融资；\n2. 完成一系列合作和营销活动，合作伙伴包括：My Crypto Profile、Metaverse Travel Agency、Isla Obscura、deadmau5、Pororo the Little Penguin 等，营销活动包括 NFT 制作竞赛和万圣节活动等等。\n\n团队于 10 月 1 号宣布 The Sandbox Alpha 的入口点为 Main Hub，即将开放。\n\n#### 未来\n\n* 技术：实现多平台可用，支持手机和平板等设备；实现多玩家模式；\n* 基金会：逐渐向 DAO 转移，使 SAND 持有者可以参与决策获得收益；\n* 运营：继续定期出售土地；举办一系列的激励活动，吸引内容创造者，完善内部生态，希望在 2 年内达到 100 万用户；\n* 合作伙伴：与更多游戏达成合作，将 The Sandbox 构建为游戏平台，争取在 2023 年在 The Sandbox 内部有 5,000 个游戏可用。\n\n总结：团队想要将 The Sandbox 开发成一个结构较为完善的沙盒平台，用户可以设计、部署、参与游戏，并通过这个平台获取收益。从团队的发展路线和规划来看，团队的规划比较清晰，目标明确，总体的设计是比较完善的。团队过去 2 年的发展基本能够按照路线图完成，并且已经确定好了未来 3 年的发展目标。在技术上，团队是有能力完成的，但达到目标用户数方面困难比较大，这是整个区块链沙盒游戏普遍存在的问题。\n\n### 经济模型\n\n#### 代币分布状况\n\n**代币初始分配**\n\n初始发行总量为 30 亿，代币分配如下：\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The Sandbox](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/b5f258c1f7b057fcb9c40ba8b6d0ddef.png-article)\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The Sandbox](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/7077fa2502105030991b6bc39c20bf9e_SttLzSi.png-article)\n\nThe Sandbox 的代币总量为 30 亿枚，目前已流通约 9 亿枚，包括币安 IEO 代币、公司储备的部分代币、基金会持有代币。团队白皮书中未详述具体的代币释放时间，可能是线性释放，在 2025 年实现 100% 释放。\n\n**Top100 地址代币集中度**\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The Sandbox](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/15d0813d7ea95e38a65dbbfa66b8c227_KiskOOE.png-article)\n\n根据 Nansen 和 Etherscan 数据，截至 2021 年 11 月 2 日，链上持币地址共 34,120 个，目前 9.75% 地址掌控 80% 的代币，其中基金会、公司储备、顾问、团队 4 个地址共持有将近 70% 的代币，交易所持币约 9%，因此从链上地址看，代币分布不算集中。从 2020 年 8 月代币释放开始，链上持币地址稳步增长。\n\n#### 作用\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The Sandbox](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/26d2cdf288495ab595516aacb0ffb084_Sd0mopX.png-article)\n\n上图为团队构建的 SAND 经济模型，从设计来看，SAND 的代币用途比较多。由于目前虚拟世界还未开放，因此 SAND 的主要作用仅是土地拍卖、其他 NFT 资产的交易，参与流动性挖矿等，需求有限。待产品全面上线后，SAND 的用途扩大。\n\n总结：The Sandbox 尚处于项目早期，并且没有代币销毁机制，主要需求来自参与土地拍卖和 NFT 交易，需求比较少。整体来看，代币分布较为集中。团队、公司和基金会持有大部分的代币，公司可能会根据需要出售代币，基金也会通过活动发放代币，并且在 2021 年下半年开始，团队、公司和顾问的代币开始解锁。\n\n### 竞争\n\n#### 赛道概览\n\nThe Sandbox 所属赛道为：NFT，游戏，细分为沙盒游戏 / 虚拟现实游戏 / 元宇宙。\n\n**游戏**\n\n2020 年，游戏玩家超过 20 亿人。\n\n所有的游戏玩家可以分为以下几种类型：\n\n* 成就型玩家：玩家会给自己设定一些游戏相关的目标，并完成目标。这意味着在为了完成目标，需要积累大量的资源、经验；\n* 探索型玩家：这类玩家需要较高的自由度，会尝试游戏中能够有的体验，并收集游戏装备等。收集爱好者也是这类型的游戏玩家；\n* 社交型玩家：享收在游戏过程中与其他玩家的互动，喜欢利用公会或团队机制强化自己的社会存在感；\n* 杀手型玩家：希望利用游戏中提供的工具进行破坏（包括与 NPC/ 其他玩家 PK），或者使使用武器去帮助别人。\n\n因此，一款竞争力强的游戏需要满足：1）能够满足一种或多种类型玩家的需求，可玩性强；2）画风一流；3）能够为游戏玩家创造收益等。就目前的区块链行业而言，能够创造收益是传统游戏的附加项，但对区块链游戏来说是必须项。\n\n沙盒游戏存在两个主题，第一个主题是可以改变、影响、创造游戏中的虚拟世界，核心在于将创作权下放给玩家，具有高度自由，从而极大增强游戏的可玩性，减少了对游戏运营商的依赖。另一个主题是社交，沙盒游戏的社交更加小型，更倾向于发生在熟人之间。\n\n《我的世界（MineCraft）》是最早出现的沙盒游戏之一，月活跃用户超过 1 亿。区块链版的沙盒游戏皆可以《我的世界》作为参照模板。《我的世界》最突出的竞争力在于能够满足多种类型玩家的需求，具有很高的可玩性。由于沙盒自由度高，并且该游戏创建的红石等玩法，吸引了大批高阶玩家，能够对生态内进行再创作，形成了一个良好循环，能够同时吸引上述的 4 种玩家。\n\n《我的世界》支持单机游戏和多人服务器，用户可以在不同的服务器体验不同的游戏模式，包括探索 / 创造模式和生存冒险模式。创造模式提供无限资源，初阶玩家和高阶玩家都可以进行创作。生存模式则比创造模式更困难，需要免于 NPC 的伤害，能够吸引杀手型玩家。多人服务器通常建立有论坛和公会，可以建立沙盒游戏内的小型社交。虚拟空间内存在嵌套游戏，这些游戏部分由高阶玩家创建。玩家创建的内容可以自由定价、发布出售，因此玩家有机会使用游戏资源获利。\n\n但是网易代理《我的世界》中国版并未获得成功，主要原因包括：\n\n1. 网易团队将社区创作的内容版权占位己有，内容部署者从社区转变为官方团队，用户获利渠道被团队切断；\n2. 社区成员上架内容需要经过团队的批准，并和团队签订条约，导致自由度降低，损失用户。\n\n由此可以看出，用户的创造能力也是沙盒游戏能够可持续发展的关键因素之一。\n\n**NFT**\n\nNFT 类型主要分为数字收藏品、游戏装备、实际应用型。\n\n根据 Nonfungible 年中发布的 NFT 市场报告，2020 年上半年已有接近 8 万个活跃的 NFT 地址，交易额约 2.3 亿美元。\n\n***收藏品***\n\n类型包括：数字艺术品（Art）、卡牌、图片等，没有实际用途。\n\n艺术品和古董是传统市场上主要的收藏品种类，其次还有一些其他领域的收藏品，包括邮票、奢侈品限量发行的产品、签名纪念品等等。\n\n收藏品的价值主要体现在：\n\n1. 历史价值，首先物品中包含的时间价值无法复制，其次具有历史价值的物品具有一定的研究意义，蕴含历史文化；\n2. 名人效应；\n3. 审美价值，作者的才华被大众肯定，作品的价值就会被上涨，并达到相应的平衡，因此未具有知名度的优秀作品存在价值上涨的空间；\n4. 稀有程度，根据供需，越稀少的东西价格越高。\n\n2019 年传统艺术品市场约拍卖 55 万件艺术品，金额约 133 亿美元。全球前 100 强的人均拍卖约 20 件艺术品，具有大量资金的人是拍卖市场的主要参与者。SuperRare、Known Origin、Makers Place 艺术品 NFT 二级市场在 2020 年第一季度的交易总额约为 400 万美元，交易笔数约 10 万笔，参与交易的活跃地址数约为 5,000 个。从此数据可以看出，和传统市场一样，也只有少数人参与数字艺术收藏品 NFT 交易。符合行情或形成价值共识的收藏被称为「软黄金」，具有很高的流通性。\n\n尽管一些项目收藏品数量稀少，但是价值支撑较少，在没有大范围形成价值共识的情况下，只能在小范围内流通，很难提高流动性。为了提高收藏品 NFT 的价值，收藏类 NFT 的发展趋势是为 NFT 增加名人效应，开始与知名品牌或大机构合作，发布联名款限量 NFT，包括币安周年纪念 NFT 等等。\n\n个人购买收藏品的动机可以归类为 3 类：1）爱好；2）升值期待；3）保值。\n\n但是当前收藏类的 NFT 面临着尚未形成价值共识的问题，尽管存在一定的审美价值，但人为炒作占有很大成分，具有较高的投机性。升值期待是区块链用户购买 NFT 数字收藏品的主要原因，大部分购买此类 NFT 的用户是希望这类 NFT 会因为名人效应、审美价值等升值，并从中获得利润。\n\n***游戏装备***\n\n代表：Gods Unchained 等卡牌游戏、Decentraland 等虚拟现实游戏、及其他类型的游戏。\n\n游戏装备 NFT 是指可以应用到游戏场景中的 NFT。此类 NFT 最大的特点是使游戏用户获得游戏资产的真实所有权，这有别于中心化服务商发行的游戏资产中心化管理的特点。\n\n在中心化游戏平台上，服务商拥有所有游戏资产的管理权，可以无理由删除或无限复制游戏资产。一旦中心化服务器数据丢失，就会给用户资产带来损失。2019 年，全球游戏市场收入约为 1,500 亿美元，而游戏装备是游戏收入的主要来源，因此游戏装备是一个潜力巨大的市场。\n\n虚拟现实游戏中最大的 NFT 资产是虚拟房产（LAND），购买土地 / 土地的人可以在土地上部署一些内容，或者通过出租等方式获得收入。而游戏可玩性是吸引游戏玩家、对游戏资产价值形成共识、游戏可持续发展的基础。只有吸引的玩家够多，游戏装备才能够具有较高流动性。\n\n***实际应用类型***\n\n代表：以太坊域名、服务或资产所有权 NFT。\n\n* 以太坊域名：用户可以使用以太坊域名作为收款地址等；\n* 纸质门票或电子门票采用 NFT 模式：持有人之间可以互相交易；项目方可以采用 NFT 减少黄牛炒作等；\n* 市场出现了 DeFi 与 NFT 结合的趋势，包括 NFT 抵押借贷，保险保单 NFT 化等产品；\n* NFT 抵押借贷：难以评估 NFT 价值，NFT 的价值不仅会受到代币价格影响，还会受到社区对该 NFT 的价值共识的影响，对借贷系统的抗风险能力要求更高，需要有更完善的机制应对风险。\n* 保险保单 NFT 化：出现的主要契机是保险平台的 KYC 限制，导致了一部分人即使有保险需求也无法购买保险。由此产生了第三方机构通过 NFT 的形式将保单二次卖出。也就是说，一些特定的服务可以以 NFT 的形式发售，但并非所有服务都适合。虚拟现实平台的房屋租赁 NFT 的性质与 NFT 保单的性质相似，但两者的前提都是链上资产。而链下资产或链下服务的 NFT 化还需要基础设施建设更完善后才能达成。\n\n#### 竞争项目\n\n**Decentraland**\n\nDecentraland 是基于以太坊的虚拟现实平台，于 2015 年成立，于 2020 年 2 月开始正式对外开放。Decentraland 在虚拟世界预开放阶段和正式开放后，一直采取经济激励的方式吸引内容创建者。Decentraland 目前已经实现去中心化自治管理（DAO），虽然团队仍表明会继续开发，但承诺会实现的目标已经延迟发布，开发效率变低。\n\n由于发展时间较长，Decentraland 目前是此类区块链游戏的龙头。目前 Decentraland 的优势在于发展时间比较长，具有先发优势，抢占了一定市场。但问题也比较明显，包括用户留存率低、土地大片空白、用户体验不佳等。我们可以从 Decentraland 项目的发展中看出该赛道潜在的问题。\n\n**Cryptovoxels**\n\nCryptovoxels 是创建在以太坊上的虚拟平台，采用了体素风格。Cryptovoxels 中的土地是由 6 个数字（x1，y1，z1，x2，y2，z2）表示，目前地图中共 3,000 块土地，根据用户增长情况逐步开发土地拍卖。用户可以使用以太坊购买土地。Cryptovoxels 只有一位开发人员，但开发进度较块，当前的功能包括添加音频、图像、文本、GIF 图片等。\n\n#### 竞争分析\n\n**代码情况**\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The Sandbox](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/ba4ae1ed84d6547c88985507d2375367_QIb5eZR.png-article)\n\nThe Sandbox、Decentraland、Cryptovoxels 的代码提交主体不同，因此呈现的数据不同。Decentraland 最初是团队的形式，但都是个人提交代码，因此代码提交量比较多。The Sandbox 以公司的形式进行开发，通过主要几个人进行代码提交，而 Cryptovoxels 的核心开发只有一个人，因此两者的代码提交量相似，The Sandbox 代码提交量略多余 Cryptovoxels。3 个项目都在持续开发。\n\n**产品对比**\n\n***用户和交易数据***\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The Sandbox](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/96a7b12b7bac5cc3b8a0683b55554d12_pfXB5C9.png-article)\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The Sandbox](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/f92a01b99b30514d804c92aea773a018_GuaFTtu.png-article)\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The Sandbox](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/c7bea7d4f6625d49a249b7888eadd69f_gIeLa2e.png-article)\n\n注：\n\n1）图片仅显示近一个月的数据变化；2）各个项目统计了所有相关的智能合约地址；3）一个用户可能拥有多个地址；4）交易数代表用户地址和智能合约地址数的交易次数。\n\n虽然统计项目各个相关的智能合约地址，但从数据上看，可能没有计入代币交易，仅计入 NFT 相关交易。由于 The Sandbox 还未完全开放，因上述仅为参与 NFT 交易的数据，12 月 11 号的数据为土地拍卖。目前 The Sandbox、Cryptovoxels 都尚处于发展早期，因此数据也比较早期，与已经长期发展的 Decentraland 对比没有很大意义。但在同期项目中，The Sandbox 的数据比较突出。\n\n***用户留存***\n\n用户留存是值新增用户在 N 周之后仍然使用此应用的用户量。通常情况下，质量越好的应用留存度高，可玩性越高的游戏留存度高。\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The Sandbox](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/f585773c54e6586fb13d6677f55f3052_7kt8cNU.png-article)\n\n![头等仓：深入解读热门区块链沙盒游戏 The Sandbox](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/de4f11aa59f853ada0823e3cdd8763fc_Vr3XJmF.png-article)\n\nThe Sandbox 暂未开放虚拟世界游览，因此无法获取其实际的玩家用户数和留存率。但从老牌 Decentraland 和较新项目 Cryptovoxels 的留存率可以看出，虚拟现实类的游戏存在留存率低的问题。主要原因在于除了土地所有者外，其他人的参与度比较低、虚拟世界内的用户体验较差。如果 The Sandbox 可以在用户体验、参与度上突破，可以在用户留存上有进一步的提升。\n\n***经济模型 / 玩法***\n\n代币\n\n* Decentraland：主要用于购买 NFT、虚拟世界内部游戏币、和 DAO 投票治理。\n* The Sandbox：SAND 代币的用途与 Decentraland MANA 代币用途基本一致，但与 Decentraland 相比，SAND 持有人可以通过质押代币获得奖励，增加了获利途径。\n* Cryptovoxels：虚拟世界内有用于购买颜色体素的代币，属于生态内的道具。\n\n土地\n\n* Decentraland：土地已经大部分拍卖完成，不同的社区提出了不同的发展模式。土地的交易主要在 Decentraland 市场或二级交易市场。但目前很大一部分土地没有人建设。\n* The Sandbox：目前仅拍卖了 31% 的土地，还有很大一部分土地待拍卖。处于发展早期。\n* Cryptovoxels：如果世界内的用户数不断增加，那么会增加拍卖土地，这主要由创始人决定。还有很多土地待拍卖，处于发展早期。\n\n内容层\n\n* Decentraland：\n\n土地建设：土地持有者需要自己创建，或通过游戏开发商处购买游戏。小区地的发展主要依靠社区组织，如果社区消极懈怠，极大可能造成土地大量荒废。而社区比较积极的小区则内容比较丰富，包括拉斯维加斯城等小区。\n\nNFT：主要是土地和可穿戴 NFT。目前 NFT 的创作权下放至社区，但仅有个别团队才有创作权。用户也可以将 Decentraland 合作方的 NFT 集成到世界内。\n\n* The Sandbox：\n\n土地建设：任何用户都可以通过 Game Maker 创建自己的场景，在条件许可下，创建好的游戏可以放在市场中进行交易。土地所有者的选择权增加。团队保留了将近 25% 的土地给自己和合作伙伴，可以保证这一部分的土地不会被空置。75% 的土地是拍卖给个人的，这一部分需要依靠个人创建或从市场中购买已建好的内容。由于不必须自己去创建并且有较多的选择，因此部署难度是低于 Decentraland 的。\n\nNFT：任何用户都可以创建包括虚拟形象在内的 NFT 资产，并且可以在市场交易。NFT 的属性和稀有程度由另外的游戏道具决定，增加可玩性。Cryptovoxels：只有土地所有者有创作权，比较局限。NFT 主要是通过集成自己已有的 NFT 收藏品。\n\n玩家\n\nDecentraland：玩家主要分为 2 类，土地持有者和浏览者。\n\n土地持有者可以购买游戏开发商创建的游戏并部署在自己的土地上，但费用比较高且选择少，或自己创建内容。还可以将自己的土地出租等，参与度比较高，有通过土地获利的机会。浏览者指的是没有持有土地的用户，这类用户只能浏览虚拟世界内部，可以玩内部部署的游戏、赌博机等等，除此之外很难通过参与生态获得收益。部分小区曾经提出了租赁方案，将土地 / 店面出租，但效果不是很好。\n\nThe Sandbox：玩家类型可以分为 3 类，包括 1）土地持有者；2）浏览者；3） NFT/ 游戏创建者。土地持有者和浏览者的参与方式与 Decentraland 中的同类玩家相似。但与 Decentraland 不同的是，任何人都可以创建 The Sandbox 中的 NFT 资产和游戏并在市场中出售，一般用户增加了获得收益的方式，能够吸引更多的人参与。\n\nCryptovoxels：当前还处于个人搭建场景的发展阶段，暂未出现其他利用土地方式。浏览者可以进入浏览，没有其他参与方式，参与度比较低。\n\n总结：和传统的虚拟现实 / 沙盒游戏相比，目前区块链的沙盒游戏主要问题在于：区块链沙盒游戏的土地为个人 / 小区所有，内容部署权限定给个人 / 小区，导致了创造能力和创造权分离。\n\n一方面，土地持有人数量有限，仅依靠土地持有人很难维系游戏发展。虽然无土地的用户也可以进行探索，但参与感比较低。而游戏体验取决于创建在土地上的内容质量，即土地持有人的创造能力。如果内容质量不高，则难以吸引用户参与。\n\n另一方面，用户是游戏的根本，用户留存率不提高，土地持有人难以获得土地升值之外的额外收益，导致想要购买土地的人减少，从而形成一个恶性循环，可能会造成土地等 NFT 资产的流动性缺失。\n\nThe Sandbox 目前也在积极发布激励活动，有利于促进用户累积和生态发展。与此赛道的龙头项目 Decentraland 相比，The Sandbox 还处于非常早期，在玩法和经济模型上有创新点和改进点。从团队的计划性和效率来看，The Sandbox 更胜一筹，因此有发展的潜力。\n\n从元宇宙的角度看，The Sandbox 和 Decentraland 等区块链项目都具备游戏资产透明、玩家游戏能力可兑现、玩家自由探索交易等优势。但 The Sandbox 的游戏属性更强，而 Decentraland 和 Cryptovoxels 目前更倾向于向线上派对、聚会场所方向发展。在短期内，游戏方向可能是更可实现用户数据量级增长的领域。\n\n### 风险提示\n\n#### 行业风险\n\n目前区块链的沙盒游戏存在用户参与感低，体验较差，用户群体局限的问题。大部分参与竞拍土地的人投机性比较强，很少人愿意花精力在创建内容上，导致土地空白，从而使其他游戏参与者的用户体验变差。如果内容质量不高，也很难吸引更多的用户参与。用户是游戏的根本，用户留存率不提高，导致购买游戏 NFT 资产的意愿降低，使游戏资产贬值，导致恶性循环。\n\n#### 行业竞争\n\n游戏开发时间比较长，The Sandbox 目前还未开放虚拟世界内部，这是最核心的产品，用户可能在等待的过程中失去耐心。而 Decentraland 已经是这个领域的龙头，完成度更高，能够进入内部探索，用户参与感会更强。除此之外，包括 Cryptovoxels 和 Somnium Space 在内的更多沙盒游戏正在崛起和发展，竞争更加激烈。\n\n####

Together they take the original art to animation for the NFT market, while they still focus on their unique crafts globally. Consider the life of a Destrola as a curious child, one in which every day was another opportunity to understand and evolve the world around them. Now imagine that child always blending into the background; never defining who they are and usually playing second fiddle to friends and family.\n\nAt a certain point, there is a switch and drive to move out of the shadows. In this successful venture, they redefine themselves and realize that they have a knack for understanding perceptions and can use their skills to influence that. Moving forward Destrola forges a career in animation and design; spending time with clients to understand the questions that need to be asked and creating solutions that answer them. At the age of 23 Destrola starts pivoting into the realm of education and became a lecturer and tutor at a university; reevaluating the base understandings and helping students begin to question their own perspective of the world through their designs and creations\n\n## 1/111 Believe\n\n**To believe is to have faith and confidence that your existence is love and truth manifested in the physical plain.

It was a box office failure.\n\nThe title, refers to \"Ghosts\", consciousness stored in computer minds with cyborg bodies, \"Shells\".  \n  \n On one level, it's a police story.\n\nIn 2029 Japan, “Major Motoko Kusanagi” is a government agent is chasing a hacker, 'The Pupper Master'. \n\nThe Major is also a cyborg, a human with a machine body. The \"Puppet Master\" is an A.I. made by another agency. After journeying through different networks, the A.I. became self-aware, and a threat to its creators.  \n  \n On a deeper layer, the film was an exploration by a director who believed a film \"about the influence and power of computers... was more effectively conveyed through animation\".\n\nThe film was made with both traditional 'cel' film animation and CGI. The movie's futuristic city was based on 20th century Hong Kong - a city that is a hybrid between the past and the future.\n\nA sound studio used various sources, including spatializers to evoke the feel of electronic brain conversations, Japanese pop, Bulgarian harmonies with folk singers, and a theme from U2 and Brian Eno.\n\nSome of the story was borrowed in \"The Matrix\" trilogy, and James Cameron credited the film as one of his inspirations for \"Avatar\".\n\nDespite the bad box office, there was a sequel in 2004, soundtracks, books and an animated series. The director released a second version in 2008.  \n  \n Followups made more money than the original film.\n\nThere was a 2021 IMAX restoration, 26 years after the debut.  \n  \n When the film came out, the Internet was still new, robots couldn't walk upright yet, and 'A.I.' was in its infancy. \n \n\n**2877 EARTH, THE NECKLACE, MARS CONSULATE**\n\nI got out of the floater, and walked into the consulate. \n\nI went back to the secure room, and opened the vault, and put the package on the table.

11-0214:29优质数码领域创作者\n\n从年初开始，全球众多行业都出现了缺芯的现象，不仅是手机芯片，还包括充电IC等芯片都是供不应求。近日小米高管卢伟冰也确认了Redmi K40S“没了”，也是因为缺芯难产而导致无法量产。\n\n苹果是业内公认的“供应链管理大师”，就算台积电芯片大幅涨价，也没影响到产品的定价，今年9月发布的iPhone13系列还降价了，变成了真正的“十三香”。iPhone13系列价格虽香，无奈产能还是跟不上市场需求，尤其是首次搭载高刷屏的iPhone13Pro/Pro Max，自9月底上市以来就一直是一机难求，官网显示下单后要一个多月才能到货。\n\n![](https://pics3.baidu.com/feed/dcc451da81cb39db712f826c37ab552daa183060.jpeg?token=bf06292bc914a764125c191838af422d)\n\n苹果CEO库克在前段时间接受采访时就表示，目前苹果已经很拼了，尽最大努力力保iPhone 13系列的供货量。\n\n而随着缺芯的进一步加剧，苹果也作出了一个新的决定：**弃车保帅，减产iPad，将iPad的零部件分给iPhone 13系列**。\n\n![](https://pics1.baidu.com/feed/d53f8794a4c27d1e54f70ec9eb68f167dcc43834.jpeg?token=81a82af5dec7226bde2ceb8cb66df3d6)\n\n据多方消息显示，为了优先生产iPhone13系列，过去两个月iPad的产量比原计划下降了50%之多，不仅如此，连原本用于旧款iPhone的零部件，也被调配给iPhone13系列。\n\n苹果现在的产品一直都是在“挤牙膏”式升级，所以旧款iPhone的很多零部件，和新款是通用的。比如iPhone12系列和iPhone13系列，配置上除了芯片不同，其他基本一致。就连苹果的联合创始人沃兹尼亚克都吐槽称，iPhone13与旧款 iPhone几乎没有区别。\n\n![](https://pics2.baidu.com/feed/a08b87d6277f9e2ffbfefcaef48db52dba99f391.jpeg?token=519a6546e2d36787a79e2fac17bf2970)\n\niPad和iPhone也有不少相同的零部件，其中就包括了手机芯片，所以苹果作出了减产iPad的决定，来提升iPhone13的产能。因为相比iPad，iPhone才是苹果的“赚钱密码”。\n\n根据苹果公布的2021财年第四财季（2021年Q3，截至9月25日）的业绩报告，苹果当季营收834亿美元，当季iPhone的业务营收389亿美元，占比为46.6%。\n\niPhone13于9月24日上市，所以这份财报只统计了iPhone 13系列的两天销量，在今年第四季度，iPhone的营收占比大概率会超过60%。\n\n![](https://pics3.baidu.com/feed/b151f8198618367adae286d8cbced7ddb21ce597.jpeg?token=d3a554673a401a0478ec37b0ba516dc5)\n\niPhone13系列的缺货情况，比去年iPhone12系列上市初还要严重得多。在苹果官网，以及天猫/京东等线上电商平台上，iPhone13/13mini部分版本有货，iPhone13Pro/Pro Max是全线无货，页面显示，现在下单的话，预计要到12月8日-12月15日才能送达。\n\n正逢一年一度的双11购物狂欢节，iPhone13系列也成了各大平台的引流利器，以天猫和京东为例，在这两大平台上购买iPhone13系列，最高都能优惠600元。如果四款机型都是现货发售的话，苹果在今年双11就是一骑绝尘的存在。\n\n为了“十三香”，苹果是弃车保帅，减产iPad确保iPhone13产能，相信再过段时间，“十三香”就不会像现在这样难买了，实现全面现货供应。\\\n\n\n##

{"id": "jEKg6ziYOzwRggllRU0loqHYaT-kxjuP2GKi-C5xPPY", "title": "The Lesser Hippias may be compared with the earlier dialogues of Plato, i", "body": "in which the contrast of Socrates and the Sophists is most strongly exhibited. Hippias, like Protagoras and Gorgias, though civil, is vain and boastful:  he knows all things; he can make anything, including his own clothes; he is a manufacturer of poems and declamations, and also of seal-rings, shoes, strigils; his girdle, which he has woven himself, is of a finer than Persian quality.  He is a vainer, lighter nature than the two great Sophists (compare Protag.), but of the same character with them, and equally impatient of the short cut-and-thrust method of Socrates, whom he endeavours to draw into a long oration.  At last, he gets tired of being defeated at every point by Socrates, and is with difficulty induced to proceed (compare Thrasymachus, Protagoras, Callicles, and others, to whom the same reluctance is ascribed).\n\nHippias like Protagoras has common sense on his side, when he argues, citing passages of the Iliad in support of his view, that Homer intended Achilles to be the bravest, Odysseus the wisest of the Greeks.  But he is easily overthrown by the superior dialectics of Socrates, who pretends to show that Achilles is not true to his word, and that no similar inconsistency is to be found in Odysseus.  Hippias replies that Achilles unintentionally, but Odysseus intentionally, speaks falsehood.  But is it better to do wrong intentionally or unintentionally?  Socrates, relying on the analogy of the arts, maintains the former, Hippias the latter of the two alternatives...All this is quite conceived in the spirit of Plato, who is very far from making Socrates always argue on the side of truth.  The over-reasoning on Homer, which is of course satirical, is also in the spirit of Plato.  Poetry turned logic is even more ridiculous than 'rhetoric turned logic,' and equally fallacious.  There were reasoners in ancient as well as in modern times, who could never receive the natural impression of Homer, or of any other book which they read.  The argument of Socrates, in which he picks out the apparent inconsistencies and discrepancies in the speech and actions of Achilles, and the final paradox, 'that he who is true is also false,' remind us of the interpretation by Socrates of Simonides in the Protagoras, and of similar reasonings in the first book of the Republic.  The discrepancies which Socrates discovers in the words of Achilles are perhaps as great as those discovered by some of the modern separatists of the Homeric poems...\n\nAt last, Socrates having caught Hippias in the toils of the voluntary and involuntary, is obliged to confess that he is wandering about in the same labyrinth; he makes the reflection on himself which others would make upon him (compare Protagoras).  He does not wonder that he should be in a difficulty, but he wonders at Hippias, and he becomes sensible of the gravity of the situation, when ordinary men like himself can no longer go to the wise and be taught by them.\n\nIt may be remarked as bearing on the genuineness of this dialogue:  (1) that the manners of the speakers are less subtle and refined than in the other dialogues of Plato; (2) that the sophistry of Socrates is more palpable and unblushing, and also more unmeaning; (3) that many turns of thought and style are found in it which appear also in the other dialogues:--whether resemblances of this kind tell in favour of or against the genuineness of an ancient writing, is an important question which will have to be answered differently in different cases.  For that a writer may repeat himself is as true as that a forger may imitate; and Plato elsewhere, either of set purpose or from forgetfulness, is full of repetitions.  The parallelisms of the Lesser Hippias, as already remarked, are not of the kind which necessarily imply that the dialogue is the work of a forger.  The parallelisms of the Greater Hippias with the other dialogues, and the allusion to the Lesser (where Hippias sketches the programme of his next lecture, and invites Socrates to attend and bring any friends with him who may be competent judges), are more than suspicious:-- they are of a very poor sort, such as we cannot suppose to have been due to Plato himself.  The Greater Hippias more resembles the Euthydemus than any other dialogue; but is immeasurably inferior to it.  The Lesser Hippias seems to have more merit than the Greater, and to be more Platonic in spirit.  The character of Hippias is the same in both dialogues, but his vanity and boasting are even more exaggerated in the Greater Hippias.  His art of memory is specially mentioned in both.  He is an inferior type of the same species as Hippodamus of Miletus (Arist. Pol.).  Some passages in which the Lesser Hippias may be advantageously compared with the undoubtedly genuine dialogues of Plato are the following:--Less. Hipp.:  compare Republic (Socrates' cunning in argument):  compare Laches (Socrates' feeling about arguments):  compare Republic (Socrates not unthankful):  compare Republic (Socrates dishonest in argument).", "timestamp": 1635906418, "digest": "wSzQipBfmQOkZRMiytO0UueZDp9FAnvpN9l2d3n4s3g", "contributor": "0x66B6Cc2B3C89CFc7a8Ed89fAD25FCde4d21Df26d"}

Now I, Hippias, originally asked you the question, because I was in doubt as to which of the two heroes was intended by the poet to be the best, and because I thought that both of them were the best, and that it would be difficult to decide which was the better of them, not only in respect of truth and falsehood, but of virtue generally, for even in this matter of speaking the truth they are much upon a par.\n\nHIPPIAS:  There you are wrong, Socrates; for in so far as Achilles speaks falsely, the falsehood is obviously unintentional.  He is compelled against his will to remain and rescue the army in their misfortune.  But when Odysseus speaks falsely he is voluntarily and intentionally false.\n\nSOCRATES:  You, sweet Hippias, like Odysseus, are a deceiver yourself.\n\nHIPPIAS:  Certainly not, Socrates; what makes you say so?\n\nSOCRATES:  Because you say that Achilles does not speak falsely from design, when he is not only a deceiver, but besides being a braggart, in Homer's description of him is so cunning, and so far superior to Odysseus in lying and pretending, that he dares to contradict himself, and Odysseus does not find him out; at any rate he does not appear to say anything to him which would imply that he perceived his falsehood.\n\nHIPPIAS:  What do you mean, Socrates?\n\nSOCRATES:  Did you not observe that afterwards, when he is speaking to Odysseus, he says that he will sail away with the early dawn; but to Ajax he tells quite a different story?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Where is that?\n\nSOCRATES:  Where he says,--\n\n'I will not think about bloody war until the son of warlike Priam, illustrious Hector, comes to the tents and ships of the Myrmidons, slaughtering the Argives, and burning the ships with fire; and about my tent and dark ship, I suspect that Hector, although eager for the battle, will nevertheless stay his hand.'\n\nNow, do you really think, Hippias, that the son of Thetis, who had been the pupil of the sage Cheiron, had such a bad memory, or would have carried the art of lying to such an extent (when he had been assailing liars in the most violent terms only the instant before) as to say to Odysseus that he would sail away, and to Ajax that he would remain, and that he was not rather practising upon the simplicity of Odysseus, whom he regarded as an ancient, and thinking that he would get the better of him by his own cunning and falsehood?\n\nHIPPIAS:  No, I do not agree with you, Socrates; but I believe that Achilles is induced to say one thing to Ajax, and another to Odysseus in the innocence of his heart, whereas Odysseus, whether he speaks falsely or truly, speaks always with a purpose.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then Odysseus would appear after all to be better than Achilles?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Certainly not, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Why, were not the voluntary liars only just now shown to be better than the involuntary?\n\nHIPPIAS:  And how, Socrates, can those who intentionally err, and voluntarily and designedly commit iniquities, be better than those who err and do wrong involuntarily?  Surely there is a great excuse to be made for a man telling a falsehood, or doing an injury or any sort of harm to another in ignorance.  And the laws are obviously far more severe on those who lie or do evil, voluntarily, than on those who do evil involuntarily.\n\nSOCRATES:  You see, Hippias, as I have already told you, how pertinacious I am in asking questions of wise men.  And I think that this is the only good point about me, for I am full of defects, and always getting wrong in some way or other.  My deficiency is proved to me by the fact that when I meet one of you who are famous for wisdom, and to whose wisdom all the Hellenes are witnesses, I am found out to know nothing.  For speaking generally, I hardly ever have the same opinion about anything which you have, and what proof of ignorance can be greater than to differ from wise men?  But I have one singular good quality, which is my salvation; I am not ashamed to learn, and I ask and enquire, and am very grateful to those who answer me, and never fail to give them my grateful thanks; and when I learn a thing I never deny my teacher, or pretend that the lesson is a discovery of my own; but I praise his wisdom, and proclaim what I have learned from him.  And now I cannot agree in what you are saying, but I strongly disagree.  Well, I know that this is my own fault, and is a defect in my character, but I will not pretend to be more than I am; and my opinion, Hippias, is the very contrary of what you are saying.  For I maintain that those who hurt or injure mankind, and speak falsely and deceive, and err voluntarily, are better far than those who do wrong involuntarily.  Sometimes, however, I am of the opposite opinion; for I am all abroad in my ideas about this matter, a condition obviously occasioned by ignorance.  And just now I happen to be in a crisis of my disorder at which those who err voluntarily appear to me better than those who err involuntarily.  My present state of mind is due to our previous argument, which inclines me to believe that in general those who do wrong involuntarily are worse than those who do wrong voluntarily, and therefore I hope that you will be good to me, and not refuse to heal me; for you will do me a much greater benefit if you cure my soul of ignorance, than you would if you were to cure my body of disease.  I must, however, tell you beforehand, that if you make a long oration to me you will not cure me, for I shall not be able to follow you; but if you will answer me, as you did just now, you will do me a great deal of good, and I do not think that you will be any the worse yourself.  And I have some claim upon you also, O son of Apemantus, for you incited me to converse with Hippias; and now, if Hippias will not answer me, you must entreat him on my behalf.\n\nEUDICUS:  But I do not think, Socrates, that Hippias will require any entreaty of mine; for he has already said that he will refuse to answer no man.--Did you not say so, Hippias?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes, I did; but then, Eudicus, Socrates is always troublesome in an argument, and appears to be dishonest.  (Compare Gorgias; Republic.)\n\nSOCRATES:  Excellent Hippias, I do not do so intentionally (if I did, it would show me to be a wise man and a master of wiles, as you would argue), but unintentionally, and therefore you must pardon me; for, as you say, he who is unintentionally dishonest should be pardoned.\n\nEUDICUS:  Yes, Hippias, do as he says; and for our sake, and also that you may not belie your profession, answer whatever Socrates asks you.\n\nHIPPIAS:  I will answer, as you request me; and do you ask whatever you like.\n\nSOCRATES:  I am very desirous, Hippias, of examining this question, as to which are the better--those who err voluntarily or involuntarily?  And if you will answer me, I think that I can put you in the way of approaching the subject:  You would admit, would you not, that there are good runners?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  And there are bad runners?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he who runs well is a good runner, and he who runs ill is a bad runner?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Very true.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he who runs slowly runs ill, and he who runs quickly runs well?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then in a race, and in running, swiftness is a good, and slowness is an evil quality?\n\nHIPPIAS:  To be sure.\n\nSOCRATES:  Which of the two then is a better runner?  He who runs slowly voluntarily, or he who runs slowly involuntarily?\n\nHIPPIAS:  He who runs slowly voluntarily.\n\nSOCRATES:  And is not running a species of doing?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  And if a species of doing, a species of action?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then he who runs badly does a bad and dishonourable action in a race?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes; a bad action, certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he who runs slowly runs badly?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then the good runner does this bad and disgraceful action voluntarily, and the bad involuntarily?\n\nHIPPIAS:  That is to be inferred.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then he who involuntarily does evil actions, is worse in a race than he who does them voluntarily?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes, in a race.\n\nSOCRATES:  Well, but at a wrestling match--which is the better wrestler, he who falls voluntarily or involuntarily?\n\nHIPPIAS:  He who falls voluntarily, doubtless.\n\nSOCRATES:  And is it worse or more dishonourable at a wrestling match, to fall, or to throw another?\n\nHIPPIAS:  To fall.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then, at a wrestling match, he who voluntarily does base and dishonourable actions is a better wrestler than he who does them involuntarily?\n\nHIPPIAS:  That appears to be the truth.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what would you say of any other bodily exercise--is not he who is better made able to do both that which is strong and that which is weak--that which is fair and that which is foul?--so that when he does bad actions with the body, he who is better made does them voluntarily, and he who is worse made does them involuntarily.\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes, that appears to be true about strength.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what do you say about grace, Hippias?  Is not he who is better made able to assume evil and disgraceful figures and postures voluntarily, as he who is worse made assumes them involuntarily?\n\nHIPPIAS:  True.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then voluntary ungracefulness comes from excellence of the bodily frame, and involuntary from the defect of the bodily frame?\n\nHIPPIAS:  True.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what would you say of an unmusical voice; would you prefer the voice which is voluntarily or involuntarily out of tune?\n\nHIPPIAS:  That which is voluntarily out of tune.\n\nSOCRATES:  The involuntary is the worse of the two?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  And would you choose to possess goods or evils?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Goods.\n\nSOCRATES:  And would you rather have feet which are voluntarily or involuntarily lame?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Feet which are voluntarily lame.\n\nSOCRATES:  But is not lameness a defect or deformity?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  And is not blinking a defect in the eyes?", "timestamp": 1635906511, "digest": "Cu0gC7urHDv0YRL8n90hMleqKdBQpeamWMk_KLt9Xm8", "contributor": "0xF701458E2D6717439ED97C778745d2D489b00797"}
{"id": "unYZXgBmqhzK3A6k3Udu4nMD414hltkjsU_15nZRryg", "title": "y exact line the genuine writings of Plato from the spurious.  The only external evidence to ", "body": "These considerations lead us to adopt the following criteria of genuineness:  (1) That is most certainly Plato's which Aristotle attributes to him by name, which (2) is of considerable length, of (3) great excellence, and also (4) in harmony with the general spirit of the Platonic writings.  But the testimony of Aristotle cannot always be distinguished from that of a later age (see above); and has various degrees of importance.  Those writings which he cites without mentioning Plato, under their own names, e.g. the Hippias, the Funeral Oration, the Phaedo, etc., have an inferior degree of evidence in their favour.  They may have been supposed by him to be the writings of another, although in the case of really great works, e.g. the Phaedo, this is not credible; those again which are quoted but not named, are still more defective in their external credentials.  There may be also a possibility that Aristotle was mistaken, or may have confused the master and his scholars in the case of a short writing; but this is inconceivable about a more important work, e.g. the Laws, especially when we remember that he was living at Athens, and a frequenter of the groves of the Academy, during the last twenty years of Plato's life.  Nor must we forget that in all his numerous citations from the Platonic writings he never attributes any passage found in the extant dialogues to any one but Plato.  And lastly, we may remark that one or two great writings, such as the Parmenides and the Politicus, which are wholly devoid of Aristotelian (1) credentials may be fairly attributed to Plato, on the ground of (2) length, (3) excellence, and (4) accordance with the general spirit of his writings.  Indeed the greater part of the evidence for the genuineness of ancient Greek authors may be summed up under two heads only:  (1) excellence; and (2) uniformity of tradition--a kind of evidence, which though in many cases sufficient, is of inferior value.\n\nProceeding upon these principles we appear to arrive at the conclusion that nineteen-twentieths of all the writings which have ever been ascribed to Plato, are undoubtedly genuine.  There is another portion of them, including the Epistles, the Epinomis, the dialogues rejected by the ancients themselves, namely, the Axiochus, De justo, De virtute, Demodocus, Sisyphus, Eryxias, which on grounds, both of internal and external evidence, we are able with equal certainty to reject.  But there still remains a small portion of which we are unable to affirm either that they are genuine or spurious.  They may have been written in youth, or possibly like the works of some painters, may be partly or wholly the compositions of pupils; or they may have been the writings of some contemporary transferred by accident to the more celebrated name of Plato, or of some Platonist in the next generation who aspired to imitate his master.  Not that on grounds either of language or philosophy we should lightly reject them.  Some difference of style, or inferiority of execution, or inconsistency of thought, can hardly be considered decisive of their spurious character.  For who always does justice to himself, or who writes with equal care at all times?  Certainly not Plato, who exhibits the greatest differences in dramatic power, in the formation of sentences, and in the use of words, if his earlier writings are compared with his later ones, say the Protagoras or Phaedrus with the Laws.  Or who can be expected to think in the same manner during a period of authorship extending over above fifty years, in an age of great intellectual activity, as well as of political and literary transition?  Certainly not Plato, whose earlier writings are separated from his later ones by as wide an interval of philosophical speculation as that which separates his later writings from Aristotle.\n\nThe dialogues which have been translated in the first Appendix, and which appear to have the next claim to genuineness among the Platonic writings, are the Lesser Hippias, the Menexenus or Funeral Oration, the First Alcibiades.  Of these, the Lesser Hippias and the Funeral Oration are cited by Aristotle; the first in the Metaphysics, the latter in the Rhetoric.  Neither of them are expressly attributed to Plato, but in his citation of both of them he seems to be referring to passages in the extant dialogues.  From the mention of 'Hippias' in the singular by Aristotle, we may perhaps infer that he was unacquainted with a second dialogue bearing the same name.  Moreover, the mere existence of a Greater and Lesser Hippias, and of a First and Second Alcibiades, does to a certain extent throw a doubt upon both of them.  Though a very clever and ingenious work, the Lesser Hippias does not appear to contain anything beyond the power of an imitator, who was also a careful student of the earlier Platonic writings, to invent.  The motive or leading thought of the dialogue may be detected in Xen. Mem., and there is no similar instance of a 'motive' which is taken from Xenophon in an undoubted dialogue of Plato.  On the other hand, the upholders of the genuineness of the dialogue will find in the Hippias a true Socratic spirit; they will compare the Ion as being akin both in subject and treatment; they will urge the authority of Aristotle; and they will detect in the treatment of the Sophist, in the satirical reasoning upon Homer, in the reductio ad absurdum of the doctrine that vice is ignorance, traces of a Platonic authorship.  In reference to the last point we are doubtful, as in some of the other dialogues, whether the author is asserting or overthrowing the paradox of Socrates, or merely following the argument 'whither the wind blows.'  That no conclusion is arrived at is also in accordance with the character of the earlier dialogues.  The resemblances or imitations of the Gorgias, Protagoras, and Euthydemus, which have been observed in the Hippias, cannot with certainty be adduced on either side of the argument.  On the whole, more may be said in favour of the genuineness of the Hippias than against it.\n\nThe Menexenus or Funeral Oration is cited by Aristotle, and is interesting as supplying an example of the manner in which the orators praised 'the Athenians among the Athenians,' falsifying persons and dates, and casting a veil over the gloomier events of Athenian history.  It exhibits an acquaintance with the funeral oration of Thucydides, and was, perhaps, intended to rival that great work.  If genuine, the proper place of the Menexenus would be at the end of the Phaedrus.  The satirical opening and the concluding words bear a great resemblance to the earlier dialogues; the oration itself is professedly a mimetic work, like the speeches in the Phaedrus, and cannot therefore be tested by a comparison of the other writings of Plato.  The funeral oration of Pericles is expressly mentioned in the Phaedrus, and this may have suggested the subject, in the same manner that the Cleitophon appears to be suggested by the slight mention of Cleitophon and his attachment to Thrasymachus in the Republic; and the Theages by the mention of Theages in the Apology and Republic; or as the Second Alcibiades seems to be founded upon the text of Xenophon, Mem.  A similar taste for parody appears not only in the Phaedrus, but in the Protagoras, in the Symposium, and to a certain extent in the Parmenides.\n\nTo these two doubtful writings of Plato I have added the First Alcibiades, which, of all the disputed dialogues of Plato, has the greatest merit, and is somewhat longer than any of them, though not verified by the testimony of Aristotle, and in many respects at variance with the Symposium in the description of the relations of Socrates and Alcibiades.  Like the Lesser Hippias and the Menexenus, it is to be compared to the earlier writings of Plato.  The motive of the piece may, perhaps, be found in that passage of the Symposium in which Alcibiades describes himself as self-convicted by the words of Socrates.  For the disparaging manner in which Schleiermacher has spoken of this dialogue there seems to be no sufficient foundation.  At the same time, the lesson imparted is simple, and the irony more transparent than in the undoubted dialogues of Plato.  We know, too, that Alcibiades was a favourite thesis, and that at least five or six dialogues bearing this name passed current in antiquity, and are attributed to contemporaries of Socrates and Plato.  (1) In the entire absence of real external evidence (for the catalogues of the Alexandrian librarians cannot be regarded as trustworthy); and (2) in the absence of the highest marks either of poetical or philosophical excellence; and (3) considering that we have express testimony to the existence of contemporary writings bearing the name of Alcibiades, we are compelled to suspend our judgment on the genuineness of the extant dialogue.\n\nNeither at this point, nor at any other, do we propose to draw an absolute line of demarcation between genuine and spurious writings of Plato.  They fade off imperceptibly from one class to another.  There may have been degrees of genuineness in the dialogues themselves, as there are certainly degrees of evidence by which they are supported.  The traditions of the oral discourses both of Socrates and Plato may have formed the basis of semi-Platonic writings; some of them may be of the same mixed character which is apparent in Aristotle and Hippocrates, although the form of them is different.  But the writings of Plato, unlike the writings of Aristotle, seem never to have been confused with the writings of his disciples:  this was probably due to their definite form, and to their inimitable excellence.  The three dialogues which we have offered in the Appendix to the criticism of the reader may be partly spurious and partly genuine; they may be altogether spurious;--that is an alternative which must be frankly admitted.  Nor can we maintain of some other dialogues, such as the Parmenides, and the Sophist, and Politicus, that no considerable objection can be urged against them, though greatly overbalanced by the weight (chiefly) of internal evidence in their favour.  Nor, on the other hand, can we exclude a bare possibility that some dialogues which are usually rejected, such as the Greater Hippias and the Cleitophon, may be genuine.  The nature and object of these semi-Platonic writings require more careful study and more comparison of them with one another, and with forged writings in general, than they have yet received, before we can finally decide on their character.  We do not consider them all as genuine until they can be proved to be spurious, as is often maintained and still more often implied in this and similar discussions; but should say of some of them, that their genuineness is neither proven nor disproven until further evidence about them can be adduced.  And we are as confident that the Epistles are spurious, as that the Republic, the Timaeus, and the Laws are genuine.\n\nOn the whole, not a twentieth part of the writings which pass under the name of Plato, if we exclude the works rejected by the ancients themselves and two or three other plausible inventions, can be fairly doubted by those who are willing to allow that a considerable change and growth may have taken place in his philosophy (see above).  That twentieth debatable portion scarcely in any degree affects our judgment of Plato, either as a thinker or a writer, and though suggesting some interesting questions to the scholar and critic, is of little importance to the general reader.\n\nLESSER HIPPIAS\n\nby", "timestamp": 1635906386, "digest": "bPRWg9qlPevPFuc3PIq2C6cROqL1nnaKBZRBX9D03Kc", "contributor": "0x6140E4c4b50f53D4a2621DF028b75Ce94f88De5b"}

Why do you not either refute his words, if he seems to you to have been wrong in any point, or join with us in commending him?  There is the more reason why you should speak, because we are now alone, and the audience is confined to those who may fairly claim to take part in a philosophical discussion.\n\nSOCRATES:  I should greatly like, Eudicus, to ask Hippias the meaning of what he was saying just now about Homer.  I have heard your father, Apemantus, declare that the Iliad of Homer is a finer poem than the Odyssey in the same degree that Achilles was a better man than Odysseus; Odysseus, he would say, is the central figure of the one poem and Achilles of the other.  Now, I should like to know, if Hippias has no objection to tell me, what he thinks about these two heroes, and which of them he maintains to be the better; he has already told us in the course of his exhibition many things of various kinds about Homer and divers other poets.\n\nEUDICUS:  I am sure that Hippias will be delighted to answer anything which you would like to ask; tell me, Hippias, if Socrates asks you a question, will you answer him?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Indeed, Eudicus, I should be strangely inconsistent if I refused to answer Socrates, when at each Olympic festival, as I went up from my house at Elis to the temple of Olympia, where all the Hellenes were assembled, I continually professed my willingness to perform any of the exhibitions which I had prepared, and to answer any questions which any one had to ask.\n\nSOCRATES:  Truly, Hippias, you are to be congratulated, if at every Olympic festival you have such an encouraging opinion of your own wisdom when you go up to the temple.  I doubt whether any muscular hero would be so fearless and confident in offering his body to the combat at Olympia, as you are in offering your mind.\n\nHIPPIAS:  And with good reason, Socrates; for since the day when I first entered the lists at Olympia I have never found any man who was my superior in anything.  (Compare Gorgias.)\n\nSOCRATES:  What an ornament, Hippias, will the reputation of your wisdom be to the city of Elis and to your parents!  But to return:  what say you of Odysseus and Achilles?  Which is the better of the two? and in what particular does either surpass the other?  For when you were exhibiting and there was company in the room, though I could not follow you, I did not like to ask what you meant, because a crowd of people were present, and I was afraid that the question might interrupt your exhibition.  But now that there are not so many of us, and my friend Eudicus bids me ask, I wish you would tell me what you were saying about these two heroes, so that I may clearly understand; how did you distinguish them?\n\nHIPPIAS:  I shall have much pleasure, Socrates, in explaining to you more clearly than I could in public my views about these and also about other heroes.  I say that Homer intended Achilles to be the bravest of the men who went to Troy, Nestor the wisest, and Odysseus the wiliest.\n\nSOCRATES:  O rare Hippias, will you be so good as not to laugh, if I find a difficulty in following you, and repeat my questions several times over?  Please to answer me kindly and gently.\n\nHIPPIAS:  I should be greatly ashamed of myself, Socrates, if I, who teach others and take money of them, could not, when I was asked by you, answer in a civil and agreeable manner.\n\nSOCRATES:  Thank you:  the fact is, that I seemed to understand what you meant when you said that the poet intended Achilles to be the bravest of men, and also that he intended Nestor to be the wisest; but when you said that he meant Odysseus to be the wiliest, I must confess that I could not understand what you were saying.  Will you tell me, and then I shall perhaps understand you better; has not Homer made Achilles wily?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Certainly not, Socrates; he is the most straight-forward of mankind, and when Homer introduces them talking with one another in the passage called the Prayers, Achilles is supposed by the poet to say to Odysseus:--\n\n'Son of Laertes, sprung from heaven, crafty Odysseus, I will speak out plainly the word which I intend to carry out in act, and which will, I believe, be accomplished.  For I hate him like the gates of death who thinks one thing and says another.  But I will speak that which shall be accomplished.'\n\nNow, in these verses he clearly indicates the character of the two men; he shows Achilles to be true and simple, and Odysseus to be wily and false; for he supposes Achilles to be addressing Odysseus in these lines.\n\nSOCRATES:  Now, Hippias, I think that I understand your meaning; when you say that Odysseus is wily, you clearly mean that he is false?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Exactly so, Socrates; it is the character of Odysseus, as he is represented by Homer in many passages both of the Iliad and Odyssey.\n\nSOCRATES:  And Homer must be presumed to have meant that the true man is not the same as the false?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Of course, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  And is that your own opinion, Hippias?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Certainly; how can I have any other?", "timestamp": 1635906452, "digest": "OBIVnHHlx3FKx-Q-wWwd0gPpt2fiPrubiiKn-DjmG18", "contributor": "0x47CC9063B147f6D9fF7b366328DcF5A2D6F08265"}

I am not speaking of any special case in which he is prevented by disease or something of that sort, but I am speaking generally, as I might say of you, that you are able to write my name when you like.  Would you not call a man able who could do that?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  And tell me, Hippias, are you not a skilful calculator and arithmetician?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes, Socrates, assuredly I am.\n\nSOCRATES:  And if some one were to ask you what is the sum of 3 multiplied by 700, you would tell him the true answer in a moment, if you pleased?\n\nHIPPIAS:  certainly I should.\n\nSOCRATES:  Is not that because you are the wisest and ablest of men in these matters?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  And being as you are the wisest and ablest of men in these matters of calculation, are you not also the best?\n\nHIPPIAS:  To be sure, Socrates, I am the best.\n\nSOCRATES:  And therefore you would be the most able to tell the truth about these matters, would you not?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes, I should.\n\nSOCRATES:  And could you speak falsehoods about them equally well?  I must beg, Hippias, that you will answer me with the same frankness and magnanimity which has hitherto characterized you.  If a person were to ask you what is the sum of 3 multiplied by 700, would not you be the best and most consistent teller of a falsehood, having always the power of speaking falsely as you have of speaking truly, about these same matters, if you wanted to tell a falsehood, and not to answer truly?  Would the ignorant man be better able to tell a falsehood in matters of calculation than you would be, if you chose?  Might he not sometimes stumble upon the truth, when he wanted to tell a lie, because he did not know, whereas you who are the wise man, if you wanted to tell a lie would always and consistently lie?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes, there you are quite right.\n\nSOCRATES:  Does the false man tell lies about other things, but not about number, or when he is making a calculation?\n\nHIPPIAS:  To be sure; he would tell as many lies about number as about other things.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then may we further assume, Hippias, that there are men who are false about calculation and number?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Who can they be?  For you have already admitted that he who is false must have the ability to be false:  you said, as you will remember, that he who is unable to be false will not be false?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes, I remember; it was so said.\n\nSOCRATES:  And were you not yourself just now shown to be best able to speak falsely about calculation?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes; that was another thing which was said.\n\nSOCRATES:  And are you not likewise said to speak truly about calculation?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then the same person is able to speak both falsely and truly about calculation?  And that person is he who is good at calculation--the arithmetician?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Who, then, Hippias, is discovered to be false at calculation?  Is he not the good man?  For the good man is the able man, and he is the true man.\n\nHIPPIAS:  That is evident.\n\nSOCRATES:  Do you not see, then, that the same man is false and also true about the same matters?  And the true man is not a whit better than the false; for indeed he is the same with him and not the very opposite, as you were just now imagining.\n\nHIPPIAS:  Not in that instance, clearly.\n\nSOCRATES:  Shall we examine other instances?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Certainly, if you are disposed.\n\nSOCRATES:  Are you not also skilled in geometry?\n\nHIPPIAS:  I am.\n\nSOCRATES:  Well, and does not the same hold in that science also?  Is not the same person best able to speak falsely or to speak truly about diagrams; and he is--the geometrician?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  He and no one else is good at it?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes, he and no one else.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then the good and wise geometer has this double power in the highest degree; and if there be a man who is false about diagrams the good man will be he, for he is able to be false; whereas the bad is unable, and for this reason is not false, as has been admitted.\n\nHIPPIAS:  True.\n\nSOCRATES:  Once more--let us examine a third case; that of the astronomer, in whose art, again, you, Hippias, profess to be a still greater proficient than in the preceding--do you not?\n\nHIPPIAS:  Yes, I am.\n\nSOCRATES:  And does not the same hold of astronomy?\n\nHIPPIAS:  True, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  And in astronomy, too, if any man be able to speak falsely he will be the good astronomer, but he who is not able will not speak falsely, for he has no knowledge.\n\nHIPPIAS:  Clearly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then in astronomy also, the same man will be true and false?\n\nHIPPIAS:  It would seem so.\n\nSOCRATES:  And now, Hippias, consider the question at large about all the sciences, and see whether the same principle does not always hold.  I know that in most arts you are the wisest of men, as I have heard you boasting in the agora at the tables of the money-changers, when you were setting forth the great and enviable stores of your wisdom; and you said that upon one occasion, when you went to the Olympic games, all that you had on your person was made by yourself.  You began with your ring, which was of your own workmanship, and you said that you could engrave rings; and you had another seal which was also of your own workmanship, and a strigil and an oil flask, which you had made yourself; you said also that you had made the shoes which you had on your feet, and the cloak and the short tunic; but what appeared to us all most extraordinary and a proof of singular art, was the girdle of your tunic, which, you said, was as fine as the most costly Persian fabric, and of your own weaving; moreover, you told us that you had brought with you poems, epic, tragic, and dithyrambic, as well as prose writings of the most various kinds; and you said that your skill was also pre-eminent in the arts which I was just now mentioning, and in the true principles of rhythm and harmony and of orthography; and if I remember rightly, there were a great many other accomplishments in which you excelled.  I have forgotten to mention your art of memory, which you regard as your special glory, and I dare say that I have forgotten many other things; but, as I was saying, only look to your own arts--and there are plenty of them--and to those of others; and tell me, having regard to the admissions which you and I have made, whether you discover any department of art or any description of wisdom or cunning, whichever name you use, in which the true and false are different and not the same:  tell me, if you can, of any.  But you cannot.\n\nHIPPIAS:  Not without consideration, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Nor will consideration help you, Hippias, as I believe; but then if I am right, remember what the consequence will be.\n\nHIPPIAS:  I do not know what you mean, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  I suppose that you are not using your art of memory, doubtless because you think that such an accomplishment is not needed on the present occasion.  I will therefore remind you of what you were saying:  were you not saying that Achilles was a true man, and Odysseus false and wily?\n\nHIPPIAS:  I was.\n\nSOCRATES:  And now do you perceive that the same person has turned out to be false as well as true?  If Odysseus is false he is also true, and if Achilles is true he is also false, and so the two men are not opposed to one another, but they are alike.\n\nHIPPIAS:  O Socrates, you are always weaving the meshes of an argument, selecting the most difficult point, and fastening upon details instead of grappling with the matter in hand as a whole.  Come now, and I will demonstrate to you, if you will allow me, by many satisfactory proofs, that Homer has made Achilles a better man than Odysseus, and a truthful man too; and that he has made the other crafty, and a teller of many untruths, and inferior to Achilles.  And then, if you please, you shall make a speech on the other side, in order to prove that Odysseus is the better man; and this may be compared to mine, and then the company will know which of us is the better speaker.\n\nSOCRATES:  O Hippias, I do not doubt that you are wiser than I am.  But I have a way, when anybody else says anything, of giving close attention to him, especially if the speaker appears to me to be a wise man.  Having a desire to understand, I question him, and I examine and analyse and put together what he says, in order that I may understand; but if the speaker appears to me to be a poor hand, I do not interrogate him, or trouble myself about him, and you may know by this who they are whom I deem to be wise men, for you will see that when I am talking with a wise man, I am very attentive to what he says; and I ask questions of him, in order that I may learn, and be improved by him.  And I could not help remarking while you were speaking, that when you recited the verses in which Achilles, as you argued, attacks Odysseus as a deceiver, that you must be strangely mistaken, because Odysseus, the man of wiles, is never found to tell a lie; but Achilles is found to be wily on your own showing.  At any rate he speaks falsely; for first he utters these words, which you just now repeated,--\n\n'He is hateful to me even as the gates of death who thinks one thing and says another:'--\n\nAnd then he says, a little while afterwards, he will not be persuaded by Odysseus and Agamemnon, neither will he remain at Troy; but, says he,--\n\n'To-morrow, when I have offered sacrifices to Zeus and all the Gods, having loaded my ships well, I will drag them down into the deep; and then you shall see, if you have a mind, and if such things are a care to you, early in the morning my ships sailing over the fishy Hellespont, and my men eagerly plying the oar; and, if the illustrious shaker of the earth gives me a good voyage, on the third day I shall reach the fertile Phthia.'\n\nAnd before that, when he was reviling Agamemnon, he said,--", "timestamp": 1635906481, "digest": "idbC5JL-IgNXV0gVFUYdPlrMkJyHiwh-BnyRZ8pYVKQ", "contributor": "0xfbd725612A5299FAE5cea4725fAb05072Fc51050"}

Sometimes the slanting rains festoon scarfs of mist about their crests, and the peaks fade into shadowy outlines, melting, melting, forever melting into the distances.  But for most days in the year the sun circles the twin glories with a sweep of gold.  The moon washes them with a torrent of silver.  Oftentimes, when the city is shrouded in rain, the sun yellows their snows to a deep orange, but through sun and shadow they stand immovable, smiling westward above the waters of the restless Pacific, eastward above the superb beauty of the Capilano Canyon.  But the Indian tribes do now know these peaks as \"The Lions.\"  Even the Chief, whose feet have so recently wandered to the Happy Hunting Grounds, never heard the name given them until I mentioned it to him one dreamy August day, as together we followed the trail leading to the canyon.  He seemed so surprised at the name that I mentioned the reason it had been applied to them, asking him if he recalled the Landseer Lions in Trafalgar Square.  Yes, he remembered those splendid sculptures, and his quick eye saw the resemblance instantly.  It seemed to please him, and his fine face expressed the haunting memories of the faraway roar of Old London.  But the \"call of the blood\" was stronger, and presently he referred to the Indian legend of those peaks--a legend that I have reason to believe is absolutely unknown to thousands of Palefaces who look upon \"The Lions\" daily, without the love for them that is in the Indian heart; without knowledge of the secret of \"The Two Sisters. The legend was far more fascinating as it left his lips in the quaint broken English that is never so dulcet as when it slips from an Indian tongue.  His inimitable gestures, strong, graceful, comprehensive, were like a perfectly chosen frame embracing a delicate painting, and his brooding eyes were as the light in which the picture hung. \"Many thousands of years ago,\" he began, \"there were no twin peaks like sentinels guarding the outposts of this sunset coast.  They were placed there long after the first creation, when the Sagalie Tyee moulded the mountains, and patterned the mighty rivers where the salmon run, because of His love for His Indian children, and His Wisdom for their necessities.  In those times there were many and mighty Indian tribes along the Pacific-- in the mountain ranges, at the shores and sources of the great Fraser River.  Indian law ruled the land.  Indian customs prevailed. Indian beliefs were regarded.  Those were the legend-making ages when great things occurred to make the traditions we repeat to our children today.  Perhaps the greatest of these traditions is the story of 'The Two Sisters,' for they are known to us as 'The Chief's Daughters,' and to them we owe the Great Peace in which we live, and have lived for many countless moons.  There is an ancient custom amongst the Coast tribes that when our daughters step from childhood into the great world of womanhood the occasion must be made one of extreme rejoicing. The being who possesses the possibility of someday mothering a man child, a warrior, a brave, receives much consideration in most nations, but to us, the Sunset Tribes, she is honored above all people.  The parents usually give a great potlatch, and a feast that lasts many days.  The entire tribe and the surrounding tribes are bidden to this festival. More than that, sometimes when a great Tyee celebrates for his daughter, the tribes from far up the coast, from the distant north, from inland, from the island, from the Cariboo country, are gathered as guests to the feast.  During these days of rejoicing, the girl is placed in a high seat, an exalted position, for is she not marriageable? And does not marriage mean motherhood?  And does not motherhood mean a vaster nation of brave sons and of gentle daughters, who, in their turn, will give us sons and daughters of their own?\n\n\"But it was many thousands of years ago that a great Tyee had two daughters that grew to womanhood at the same springtime, when the first great run of salmon thronged the rivers, and the ollallie bushes were heavy with blossoms.  These two daughters were young, lovable, and oh! very beautiful.  Their father, the great Tyee, prepared to make a feast such as the Coast had never seen.  There were to be days and days of rejoicing, the people were to come for many leagues, were to bring gifts to the girls and to receive gifts of great value from the Chief, and hospitality was to reign as long as pleasuring feet could dance, and enjoying lips could laugh, and mouths partake of the excellence of the Chief's fish, game and ollallies.\n\n\"The only shadow on the joy of it all was war, for the tribe of the great Tyee was at war with the Upper Coast Indians, those who lived north, near what is named by the Paleface as the port of Prince Rupert.  Giant war canoes slipped along the entire coast, war parties paddled up and down, war songs broke the silences of the nights, hatred, vengeance, strife, horror festered everywhere like sores on the surface of the earth.  But the great Tyee, after warring for weeks, turned and laughed at the battle and the bloodshed, for he had been victor in every encounter, and he could well afford to leave the strife for a brief week and feast in his daughters' honor, nor permit any mere enemy to come between him and the traditions of his race and household. So he turned insultingly deaf ears to their war cries; he ignored with arrogant indifference their paddle dips that encroached within his own coast waters, and he prepared as a great Tyee should, to royally entertain his tribesmen in honor of his daughters.\n\n\"But seven suns before the great feast these two maidens came before him, hand clasped in hand.\n\n\"'Oh! our father,' they said, 'may we speak?'\n\n\"'Speak, my daughters, my girls with the eyes of April, the hearts of June'\" (early spring and early summer would be the more accurate Indian phrasing).\n\n\"'Some day, Oh! our father, we may mother a man child, who may grow to be just such a powerful Tyee as you are, and for this honor that may some day be ours we have come to crave a favor of you--you, Oh! our father.'\n\n\"'It is your privilege at this celebration to receive any favor your hearts may wish,' he replied graciously, placing his fingers beneath their girlish chins.  'The favor is yours before you ask it, my daughters.'\n\n\"'Will you, for our sakes, invite the great northern hostile tribes--the tribe you war upon--to this, our feast?' they asked fearlessly.\n\n\"'To a peaceful feast, a feast in the honor of women?' he exclaimed incredulously.\n\n\"'So we would desire it,' they answered.\n\n\"'And so shall it be,' he declared.  'I can deny you nothing this day, and some time you may bear sons to bless this peace you have asked, and to bless their mother's sire for granting it.'  Then he turned to all the young men of the tribe and commanded, 'Build fires at sunset on all the coast headlands--fires of welcome.  Man your canoes and face the north, greet the enemy, and tell them that I, the Tyee of the Capilanos, ask--no, command that they join me for a great feast in honor of my two daughters.'  And when the northern tribes got this invitation they flocked down the coast to this feast of a Great Peace.  They brought their women and their children: they brought game and fish, gold and white stone beads, baskets and carven ladles, and wonderful woven blankets to lay at the feet of their now acknowledged ruler, the great Tyee.  And he, in turn, gave such a potlatch that nothing but tradition can vie with it.  There were long, glad days of joyousness, long pleasurable nights of dancing and camp fires, and vast quantities of food.  The war canoes were emptied of their deadly weapons and filled with the daily catch of salmon.  The hostile war songs ceased, and in their place were heard the soft shuffle of dancing feet, the singing voices of women, the play-games of the children of two powerful tribes which had been until now ancient enemies, for a great and lasting brotherhood was sealed between them--their war songs were ended forever.\n\n\"Then the Sagalie Tyee smiled on His Indian children: 'I will make these young-eyed maidens immortal,' He said.  In the cup of His hands He lifted the Chief's two daughters and set them forever in a high place, for they had borne two offspring--Peace and Brotherhood --each of which is now a great Tyee ruling this land.\n\n\"And on the mountain crest the Chief's daughters can be seen wrapped in the suns, the snows, the stars of all seasons, for they have stood in this high place for thousands of years, and will stand for thousands of years to come, guarding the peace of the Pacific Coast and the quiet of the Capilano Canyon.\"\n\n\n*****\n\nThis is the Indian legend of \"The Lions of Vancouver\" as I had it from one who will tell me no more the traditions of his people.\n\nThe Siwash Rock\n\nUnique and so distinct from its surroundings as to suggest rather the handicraft of man than a whim of Nature, it looms up at the entrance to the Narrows, a symmetrical column of solid grey stone.  There are no similar formations within the range of vision, or indeed within many a day's paddle up and down the coast.  Amongst all the wonders, the natural beauties that encircle Vancouver, the marvels of mountains shaped into crouching lions and brooding beavers, the yawning canyons, the stupendous forest firs and cedars, Siwash Rock stands as distinct, as individual, as if dropped from another sphere.\n\nI saw it first in the slanting light of a redly setting August sun; the little tuft of green shrubbery that crests its summit was black against the crimson of sea and sky, and its colossal base of grey stone gleamed like flaming polished granite.\n\nMy old tillicum lifted his paddle blade to point towards it.  \"You know the story?\" he asked.  I shook my head (experience had taught me his love of silent replies, his moods of legend-telling).  For a time we paddled slowly; the rock detached itself from its background of forest and shore, and it stood forth like a sentinel--erect, enduring, eternal.\n\n\"Do you think it stands straight--like a man?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, like some noble-spirited, upright warrior,\" I replied.\n\n\"It is a man,\" he said, \"and a warrior man, too; a man who fought for everything that was noble and upright.\"\n\n\"What do you regard as everything that is noble and upright, Chief?\" I asked, curious as to his ideas.  I shall not forget the reply: it was but two words--astounding, amazing words.  He said simply:\n\n\"Clean fatherhood.\"\n\nThrough my mind raced tumultuous recollections of numberless articles in yet numberless magazines, all dealing with the recent \"fad\" of motherhood, but I had to hear from the lips of a Squamish Indian Chief the only treatise on the nobility of \"clean fatherhood\" that I have yet unearthed.  And this treatise has been an Indian legend for centuries; and lest they forget how all-important those two little words must ever be, Siwash Rock stands to remind them, set there by the Deity as a monument to one who kept his own life clean, that cleanliness might be the heritage of the generations to come.\n\nIt was \"thousands of years ago\" (all Indian legends begin in extremely remote times) that a handsome boy chief journeyed in his canoe to the upper coast for the shy little northern girl whom he brought home as his wife.  Boy though he was, the young chief had proved himself to be an excellent warrior, a fearless hunter, and an upright, courageous man among men.  His tribe loved him, his enemies respected him, and the base and mean and cowardly feared him.\n\nThe customs and traditions of his ancestors were a positive religion to him, the sayings and the advices of the old people were his creed.  He was conservative in every rite and ritual of his race.  He fought his tribal enemies like the savage that he was.  He sang his war songs, danced his war dances, slew his foes, but the little girl-wife from the north he treated with the deference that he gave his own mother, for was she not to be the mother of his warrior son?\n\nThe year rolled round, weeks merged into months, winter into spring, and one glorious summer at daybreak he wakened to her voice calling him.  She stood beside him, smiling.\n\n\"It will be to-day,\" she said proudly.\n\nHe sprang from his couch of wolf skins and looked out upon the coming day: the promise of what it would bring him seemed breathing through all his forest world.  He took her very gently by the hand and led her through the tangle of wilderness down to the water's edge, where the beauty spot we moderns call Stanley Park bends about Prospect Point.  \"I must swim,\" he told her.\n\n\"I must swim, too,\" she smiled with the perfect understanding of two beings who are mated.  For to them the old Indian custom was law--the custom that the parents of a coming child must swim until their flesh is so clear and clean that a wild animal cannot scent their proximity.  If the wild creatures of the forests have no fear of them, then, and only then, are they fit to become parents, and to scent a human is in itself a fearsome thing to all wild things.\n\nSo those two plunged into the waters of the Narrows as the grey dawn slipped up the eastern skies and all the forest awoke to the life of a new, glad day.  Presently he took her ashore, and smilingly she crept away under the giant trees.  \"I must be alone,\" she said, \"but some to me at sunrise: you will not find me alone then.\"  He smiled also, and plunged back into the sea.  He must swim, swim, swim through this hour when his fatherhood was coming upon him.  It was the law that he must be clean, spotlessly clean, so that when his child looked out upon the world it would have the chance to live its own life clean.  If he did not swim hour upon hour his child would come to an unclean father. He must give his child a chance in life; he must not hamper it by his own uncleanliness at its birth.  It was the tribal law--the law of vicarious purity.\n\nAs he swam joyously to and fro, a canoe bearing four men headed up the Narrows. These men were giants in stature, and the stroke of their paddles made huge eddies that boiled like the seething tides.\n\n\"Out from our course!\" they cried as his lithe, copper-colored body arose and fell with his splendid stroke.  He laughed at them, giants though they were, and answered that he could not cease his swimming at their demand.\n\n\"But you shall cease!\" they commanded. \"We are the men (agents) of the Sagalie Tyee (God), and we command you ashore out of our way!\"  (I find in all these Coast Indian legends that the Deity is represented by four men, usually paddling an immense canoe.)\n\nHe ceased swimming, and, lifting his head, defied them.  \"I shall not stop, nor yet go ashore,\" he declared, striking out once more to the middle of the channel.\n\n\"Do you dare disobey us,\" they cried--\"we, the men of the Sagalie Tyee?  We can turn you into a fish, or a tree, or a stone for this; do you dare disobey the Great Tyee?\"\n\n\"I dare anything for the cleanliness and purity of my coming child.  I dare even the Sagalie Tyee Himself, but my child must be born to a spotless life.\"\n\nThe four men were astounded.  They consulted together, lighted their pipes and sat in council.  Never had they, the men of the Sagalie Tyee, been defied before.  Now, for the sake of a little unborn child, they were ignored, disobeyed, almost despised.  The lithe young copper-colored body still disported itself in the cool waters; superstition held that should their canoe, or even their paddle blades, touch a human being their marvellous power would be lost.  The handsome young chief swam directly in their course.  They dared not run him down; if so, they would become as other men.  While they yet counselled what to do, there floated from out the forest a faint, strange, compelling sound.  They listened, and the young chief ceased his stroke as he listened also.  The faint sound drifted out across the waters once more.  It was the cry of a little, little child. Then one of the four men, he that steered the canoe, the strongest and tallest of them all, arose and, standing erect, stretched out his arms towards the rising sun and chanted, not a curse on the young chief's disobedience, but a promise of everlasting days and freedom from death.\n\n\"Because you have defied all things that came in your path we promise this to you,\" he chanted; \"you have defied what interferes with your child's chance for a clean life, you have lived as you wish your son to live, you have defied us when we would have stopped your swimming and hampered your child's future.  You have placed that child's future before all things, and for this the Sagalie Tyee commands us to make you forever a pattern for your tribe.  You shall never die, but you shall stand through all the thousands of years to come, where all eyes can see you. You shall live, live, live as an indestructible monument to Clean Fatherhood.\"\n\nThe four men lifted their paddles, and as the handsome young chief swam inshore, as his feet touched the line where sea and land met, he was transformed into stone.\n\nThen the four men said, \"His wife and child must ever be near him; they shall not die, but live also.\"  And they, too, were turned into stone.  If you penetrate the hollows in the woods near Siwash Rock you will find a large rock and a smaller one beside it.  They are the shy little bride-wife from the north, with her hour-old baby beside her.  And from the uttermost parts of the world vessels come daily throbbing and sailing up the Narrows.  From far trans-Pacific ports, from the frozen North, from the lands of the Southern Cross, they pass and repass the living rock that was there before their hulls were shaped, that will be there when their very names are forgotten, when their crews and their captains have taken their long last voyage, when their merchandise has rotted, and their owners are known no more.  But the tall, grey column of stone will still be there--a monument to one man's fidelity to a generation yet unborn-- and will endure from everlasting to everlasting.", "timestamp": 1635906627, "digest": "KKjnFYNVcLBJC4rHXYb5P-99QQiYAaNbisV0VrXzKvw", "contributor": "0xf960c047a47677eA00c94a1074C90850c550c24C"}

{"id": "hN3If6FicERwUEmwPIITmCqjKFP80vzZSd4-qgvfGKM", "title": "He laughed--that irresistible, though silent, David Warfield laugh of his that always brought a responsive smile from his listeners.", "body": "Then he plunged directly into the tradition, with no preface save a comprehensive sweep of his wonderful hands towards my wide window, against which the rains were beating.\n\n\"It was after a long, long time of this--this rain.  The mountain streams were swollen, the rivers choked, the sea began to rise--and yet it rained; for weeks and weeks it rained.\" He ceased speaking, while the shadows of centuries gone crept into his eyes.  Tales of the misty past always inspired him.\n\n\"Yes,\" he continued.  \"It rained for weeks and weeks, while the mountain torrents roared thunderingly down, and the sea crept silently up.  The level lands were first to float in sea water, then to disappear.  The slopes were next to slip into the sea.  The world was slowly being flooded.  Hurriedly the Indian tribes gathered in one spot, a place of safety far above the reach of the on-creeping sea.  The spot was the circling shore of Lake Beautiful, up the North Arm.  They held a Great Council and decided at once upon a plan of action. A giant canoe should be built, and some means contrived to anchor it in case the waters mounted to the heights.  The men undertook the canoe, the women the anchorage.\n\n\"A giant tree was felled, and day and night the men toiled over its construction into the most stupendous canoe the world has ever known.  Not an hour, not a moment, but many worked, while the toil-wearied ones slept, only to awake to renewed toil.  Meanwhile the women also worked at a cable--the largest, the longest, the strongest that Indian hands and teeth had ever made.  Scores of them gathered and prepared the cedar fibre; scores of them plaited, rolled and seasoned it; scores of them chewed upon it inch by inch to make it pliable; scores of them oiled and worked, oiled and worked, oiled and worked it into a sea-resisting fabric.  And still the sea crept up, and up, and up.  It was the last day; hope of life for the tribe, of land for the world, was doomed.  Strong hands, self-sacrificing hands fastened the cable the women had made--one end to the giant canoe, the other about an enormous boulder, a vast immovable rock as firm as the foundations of the world--for might not the canoe with its priceless freight drift out, far out, to sea, and when the water subsided might not this ship of safety be leagues and leagues beyond the sight of land on the storm-driven Pacific?\n\n\"Then with the bravest hearts that ever beat, noble hands lifted every child of the tribe into this vast canoe; not one single baby was overlooked.  The canoe was stocked with food and fresh water, and lastly, the ancient men and women of the race selected as guardians to these children the bravest, most stalwart, handsomest young man of the tribe, and the mother of the youngest baby in the camp--she was but a girl of sixteen, her child but two weeks old; but she, too, was brave and very beautiful.  These two were placed, she at the bow of the canoe to watch, he at the stern to guide, and all the little children crowded between.\n\n\"And still the sea crept up, and up, and up. At the crest of the bluffs about Lake Beautiful the doomed tribes crowded.  Not a single person attempted to enter the canoe. There was no wailing, no crying out for safety.  'Let the little children, the young mother, and the bravest and best of our young men live,' was all the farewell those in the canoe heard as the waters reached the summit, and--the canoe floated.  Last of all to be seen was the top of the tallest tree, then--all was a world of water.\n\n\"For days and days there was no land--just the rush of swirling, snarling sea; but the canoe rode safely at anchor, the cable those scores of dead, faithful women had made held true as the hearts that beat behind the toil and labor of it all.\n\n\"But one morning at sunrise, far to the south a speck floated on the breast of the waters; at midday it was larger; at evening it was yet larger.  The moon arose, and in its magic light the man at the stern saw it was a patch of land.  All night he watched it grow, and at daybreak looked with glad eyes upon the summit of Mount Baker.  He cut the cable, grasped his paddle in his strong, young hands, and steered for the south.  When they landed, the waters were sunken half down the mountain side.  The children were lifted out; the beautiful young mother, the stalwart young brave, turned to each other, clasped hands, looked into each other's eyes--and smiled.\n\n\"And down in the vast country that lies between Mount Baker and the Fraser River they made a new camp, built new lodges, where the little children grew and thrived, and lived and loved, and the earth was repeopled by them.\n\n\"The Squamish say that in a gigantic crevice half way to the crest of Mount Baker may yet be seen the outlines of an enormous canoe, but I have never seen it myself.\"\n\nHe ceased speaking with that far-off cadence in his voice with which he always ended a legend, and for a long time we both sat in silence listening to the rains that were still beating against the window.\n\nThe Sea-Serpent\n\nThere is one vice that is absolutely unknown to the red man; he was born without it, and amongst all the deplorable things he has learned from the white races, this, at least, he has never acquired.  That is the vice of avarice.  That the Indian looks upon greed of gain, miserliness, avariciousness and wealth accumulated above the head of his poorer neighbor as one of the lowest degradations he can fall to is perhaps more aptly illustrated in this legend than anything I could quote to demonstrate his horror of what he calls \"the white man's unkindness.\"  In a very wide and varied experience with many tribes, I have yet to find even one instance of avarice, and I have encountered but one single case of a \"stingy Indian,\" and this man was so marked amongst his fellows that at mention of his name his tribes-people jeered and would remark contemptuously that he was like a white man--hated to share his money and his possessions.  All red races are born Socialists, and most tribes carry out their communistic ideas to the letter.  Amongst the Iroquois it is considered disgraceful to have food if your neighbor has none.  To be a creditable member of the nation you must divide your possessions with your less fortunate fellows.  I find it much the same amongst the Coast Indians, though they are less bitter in their hatred of the extremes of wealth and poverty than are the Eastern tribes.  Still, the very fact that they have preserved this legend, in which they liken avarice to a slimy sea-serpent, shows the trend of their ideas; shows, too, that an Indian is an Indian, no matter what his tribe; shows that he cannot or will not hoard money; shows that his native morals demand that the spirit of greed must be strangled at all cost.\n\nThe Chief and I had sat long over our luncheon.  He had been talking of his trip to England and of the many curious things he had seen.  At last, in an outburst of enthusiasm, he said: \"I saw everything in the world --everything but a sea-serpent!\"\n\n\"But there is no such thing as a sea-serpent,\" I laughed, \"so you must have really seen everything in the world.\"\n\nHis face clouded; for a moment he sat in silence; then looking directly at me said, \"Maybe none now, but long ago there was one here--in the Inlet.\"\n\n\"How long ago?\" I asked.\n\n\"When first the white gold-hunters came,\" he replied.  \"Came with greedy, clutching fingers, greedy eyes, greedy hearts.  The white men fought, murdered, starved, went mad with love of that gold far up the Fraser River. Tillicums were tillicums no more, brothers were foes, fathers and sons were enemies. Their love of the gold was a curse.\"\n\n\"Was it then the sea-serpent was seen?\" I asked, perplexed with the problem of trying to connect the gold-seekers with such a monster.\n\n\"Yes, it was then, but----\" he hesitated, then plunged into the assertion, \"but you will not believe the story if you think there is no such thing as a sea-serpent.\"\n\n\"I shall believe whatever you tell me, Chief,\" I answered; \"I am only too ready to believe.  You know I come of a superstitious race, and all my association with the Palefaces has never yet robbed me of my birthright to believe strange traditions.\"\n\n\"You always understand,\" he said after a pause.\n\n\"It's my heart that understands,\" I remarked quietly.\n\nHe glanced up quickly, and with one of his all too few radiant smiles, he laughed.\n\n\"Yes, skookum tum-tum.\"  Then without further hesitation he told the tradition, which, although not of ancient happening, is held in great reverence by his tribe.  During its recital he sat with folded arms, leaning on the table, his head and shoulders bending eagerly towards me as I sat at the opposite side.  It was the only time he ever talked to me when he did not use emphasising gesticulations, but his hands never once lifted: his wonderful eyes alone gave expression to what he called \"The Legend of the 'Salt-chuck Oluk'\" (sea-serpent).\n\n\"Yes, it was during the first gold craze, and many of our young men went as guides to the whites far up the Fraser.  When they returned they brought these tales of greed and murder back with them, and our old people and our women shook their heads and said evil would come of it.  But all our young men, except one, returned as they went--kind to the poor, kind to those who were foodless, sharing whatever they had with their tillicums. But one, by name Shak-shak (The Hawk), came back with hoards of gold nuggets, chickimin (money), everything; he was rich like the white men, and, like them, he kept it.  He would count his chickimin, count his nuggets, gloat over them, toss them in his palms.  He loved them better than food, better than his tillicums, better than his life.  The entire tribe arose.  They said Shak-shak had the disease of greed; that to cure it he must give a great potlatch, divide his riches with the poorer ones, share them with the old, the sick, the foodless.  But he jeered and laughed and told them No, and went on loving and gloating over his gold.\n\n\"Then the Sagalie Tyee spoke out of the sky and said, 'Shak-shak, you have made of yourself a loathsome thing; you will not listen to the cry of the hungry, to the call of the old and sick; you will not share your possessions; you have made of yourself an outcast from your tribe and disobeyed the ancient laws of your people.  Now I will make of you a thing loathed and hated by all men, both white and red.  You will have two heads, for your greed has two mouths to bite.  One bites the poor, and one bites your own evil heart--and the fangs in these mouths are poison, poison that kills the hungry, and poison that kills your own manhood.  Your evil heart will beat in the very centre of your foul body, and he that pierces it will kill the disease of greed forever from amongst his people.'  And when the sun arose above the North Arm the next morning the tribes-people saw a gigantic sea-serpent stretched across the surface of the waters.  One hideous head rested on the bluffs at Brockton Point, the other rested on a group of rocks just below Mission, at the western edge of North Vancouver.  If you care to go there some day I will show you the hollow in one great stone where that head lay.  The tribespeople were stunned with horror.  They loathed the creature, they hated it, they feared it.  Day after day it lay there, its monstrous heads lifted out of the waters, its mile-long body blocking all entrance from the Narrows, all outlet from the North Arm.  The chiefs made council, the medicine men danced and chanted, but the salt-chuck oluk never moved. It could not move, for it was the hated totem of what now rules the white man's world-- greed and love of chickimin.  No one can ever move the love of chickimin from the white man's heart, no one can ever make him divide all with the poor.  But after the chiefs and medicine men had done all in their power, and still the salt-chuck oluk lay across the waters, a handsome boy of sixteen approached them and reminded them of the words of the Sagalie Tyee, 'that he that pierced the monster's heart would kill the disease of greed forever amongst his people.'\n\n\"'Let me try to find this evil heart, oh! great men of my tribe,' he cried.  'Let me war upon this creature; let me try to rid my people of this pestilence.'\n\n\"The boy was brave and very beautiful.  His tribes-people called him the Tenas Tyee (Little Chief) and they loved him.  Of all his wealth of fish and furs, of game and hykwa (large shell money) he gave to the boys who had none; he hunted food for the old people; he tanned skins and furs for those whose feet were feeble, whose eyes were fading, whose blood ran thin with age.\n\n\"'Let him go!' cried the tribes-people.  'This unclean monster can only be overcome by cleanliness, this creature of greed can only be overthrown by generosity.  Let him go!' The chiefs and the medicine men listened, then consented.  'Go,' they commanded, 'and fight this thing with your strongest weapons-- cleanliness and generosity.'\n\n\"The Tenas Tyee turned to his mother.  'I shall be gone four days,' he told her, 'and I shall swim all that time.  I have tried all my life to be generous, but the people say I must be clean also to fight this unclean thing.  While I am gone put fresh furs on my bed every day, even if I am not here to lie on them; if I know my bed, my body and my heart are all clean I can overcome this serpent.'\n\n\"'Your bed shall have fresh furs every morning,' his mother said simply.\n\n\"The Tenas Tyee then stripped himself and, with no clothing save a buckskin belt into which he thrust his hunting-knife, he flung his lithe young body into the sea.  But at the end of four days he did not return.  Sometimes his people could see him swimming far out in mid-channel, endeavoring to find the exact centre of the serpent, where lay its evil, selfish heart; but on the fifth morning they saw him rise out of the sea, climb to the summit of Brockton Point and greet the rising sun with outstretched arms.  Weeks and months went by, still the Tenas Tyee would swim daily searching for that heart of greed; and each morning the sunrise glinted on his slender young copper-colored body as he stood with outstretched arms at the tip of Brockton Point, greeting the coming day and then plunging from the summit into the sea.\n\n\"And at his home on the north shore his mother dressed his bed with fresh furs each morning.  The seasons drifted by, winter followed summer, summer followed winter. But it was four years before the Tenas Tyee found the centre of the great salt-chuck oluk and plunged his hunting-knife into its evil heart.  In its death-agony it writhed through the Narrows, leaving a trail of blackness on the waters.  Its huge body began to shrink, to shrivel; it became dwarfed and withered, until nothing but the bones of its back remained, and they, sea-bleached and lifeless, soon sank to the bed of the ocean leagues off from the rim of land.  But as the Tenas Tyee swam homeward and his clean, young body crossed through the black stain left by the serpent, the waters became clear and blue and sparkling. He had overcome even the trail of the salt-chuck oluk.\n\n\"When at last he stood in the doorway of his home he said, 'My mother, I could not have killed the monster of greed amongst my people had you not helped me by keeping one place for me at home fresh and clean for my return.'\n\n\"She looked at him as only mothers look. 'Each day these four years, fresh furs have I laid for your bed.  Sleep now, and rest, oh! my Tenas Tyee,' she said.\"\n\n\n*******\n\nThe Chief unfolded his arms, and his voice took another tone as he said, \"What do you call that story--a legend?\"\n\n\"The white people would call it an allegory,\" I answered.  He shook his head.\n\n\"No savvy,\" he smiled.\n\nI explained as simply as possible, and with his customary alertness he immediately understood. \"That's right,\" he said.  \"That's what we say it means, we Squamish, that greed is evil and not clean, like the salt-chuck oluk.  That it must be stamped out amongst our people, killed by cleanliness and generosity. The boy that overcame the serpent was both these things.\"\n\n\"What became of this splendid boy?\" I asked.\n\n\"The Tenas Tyee?  Oh! some of our old, old people say they sometimes see him now, standing on Brockton Point, his bare young arms outstretched to the rising sun,\" he replied.\n\n\"Have you ever seen him, Chief?\" I questioned.\n\n\"No,\" he answered simply.  But I have never heard such poignant regret as his wonderful voice crowded into that single word.\n\nThe Lost Island\n\nYes,\" said my old tillicum, \"we Indians have lost many things. We have lost our lands, our forests, our game, our fish; we have lost our ancient religion, our ancient dress; some of the younger people have even lost their fathers' language and the legends and traditions of their ancestors.  We cannot call those old things back to us; they will never come again.  We may travel many days up the mountain trails, and look in the silent places for them.  They are not there. We may paddle many moons on the sea, but our canoes will never enter the channel that leads to the yesterdays of the Indian people. These things are lost, just like 'The Island of the North Arm.'  They may be somewhere nearby, but no one can ever find them.\"\n\n\"But there are many islands up the North Arm,\" I asserted.\n\n\"Not the island we Indian people have sought for many tens of summers,\" he replied sorrowfully.\n\n\"Was it ever there?\" I questioned.\n\n\"Yes, it was there,\" he said.  \"My grandsires and my great-grandsires saw it; but that was long ago.  My father never saw it, though he spent many days in many years searching, always searching, for it.  I am an old man myself, and I have never seen it, though from my youth I, too, have searched.  Sometimes in the stillness of the nights I have paddled up in my canoe.\"  Then, lowering his voice: \"Twice I have seen its shadow: high rocky shores, reaching as high as the tree tops on the mainland, then tall pines and firs on its summit like a king's crown.  As I paddled up the Arm one summer night, long ago, the shadow of these rocks and firs fell across my canoe, across my face, and across the waters beyond.  I turned rapidly to look.  There was no island there, nothing but a wide stretch of waters on both sides of me, and the moon almost directly overhead.  Don't say it was the shore that shadowed me,\" he hastened, catching my thought.  \"The moon was above me; my canoe scarce made a shadow on the still waters.  No, it was not the shore.\"\n\n\"Why do you search for it?\" I lamented, thinking of the old dreams in my own life whose realization I have never attained.\n\n\"There is something on that island that I want.  I shall look for it until I die, for it is there,\" he affirmed.\n\nThere was a long silence between us after that.  I had learned to love silences when with my old tillicum, for they always led to a legend.  After a time he began voluntarily:\n\n\"It was more than one hundred years ago. This great city of Vancouver was but the dream of the Sagalie Tyee (God) at that time. The dream had not yet come to the white man; only one great Indian medicine man knew that some day a great camp for Palefaces would lie between False Creek and the Inlet. This dream haunted him; it came to him night and day--when he was amid his people laughing and feasting, or when he was alone in the forest chanting his strange songs, beating his hollow drum, or shaking his wooden witch-rattle to gain more power to cure the sick and the dying of his tribe.  For years this dream followed him.  He grew to be an old, old man, yet always he could hear voices, strong and loud, as when they first spoke to him in his youth, and they would say: 'Between the two narrow strips of salt water the white men will camp--many hundreds of them, many thousands of them.  The Indians will learn their ways, will live as they do, will become as they are.  There will be no more great war dances, no more fights with other powerful tribes; it will be as if the Indians had lost all bravery, all courage, all confidence.'  He hated the voices, he hated the dream; but all his power, all his big medicine, could not drive them away.  He was the strongest man on all the North Pacific Coast.  He was mighty and very tall, and his muscles were as those of Leloo, the timber wolf, when he is strongest to kill his prey.  He could go for many days without food; he could fight the largest mountain lion; he could overthrow the fiercest grizzly bear; he could paddle against the wildest winds and ride the highest waves. He could meet his enemies and kill whole tribes single-handed.  His strength, his courage, his power, his bravery, were those of a giant.  He knew no fear; nothing in the sea, or in the forest, nothing in the earth or the sky, could conquer him.  He was fearless, fearless. Only this haunting dream of the coming white man's camp he could not drive away; it was the one thing in life he had tried to kill and failed.  It drove him from the feasting, drove him from the pleasant lodges, the fires, the dancing, the story-telling of his people in their camp by the water's edge, where the salmon thronged and the deer came down to drink of the mountain streams.  He left the Indian village, chanting his wild songs as he went.  Up through the mighty forests he climbed, through the trailless deep mosses and matted vines, up to the summit of what the white men call Grouse Mountain.  For many days he camped there.  He ate no food, he drank no water, but sat and sang his medicine songs through the dark hours and through the day.  Before him--far beneath his feet-- lay the narrow strip of land between the two salt waters.  Then the Sagalie Tyee gave him the power to see far into the future.  He looked across a hundred years, just as he looked across what you call the Inlet, and he saw mighty lodges built close together, hundreds and thousands of them; lodges of stone and wood, and long straight trails to divide them.  He saw these trails thronging with Palefaces; he heard the sound of the white man's paddle-dip on the waters, for it is not silent like the Indian's; he saw the white man's trading posts, saw the fishing nets, heard his speech.  Then the vision faded as gradually as it came.  The narrow strip of land was his own forest once more.\n\n\"'I am old,' he called, in his sorrow and his trouble for his people.  'I am old, oh, Sagalie Tyee!  Soon I shall die and go to the Happy Hunting Grounds of my fathers.  Let not my strength die with me.  Keep living for all time my courage, my bravery, my fearlessness. Keep them for my people that they may be strong enough to endure the white man's rule. Keep my strength living for them; hide it so that the Paleface may never find or see it.'\n\n\"Then he came down from the summit of Grouse Mountain.  Still chanting his medicine songs he entered his canoe, and paddled through the colors of the setting sun far up the North Arm.  When night fell he came to an island with misty shores of great grey rock; on its summit tall pines and firs circled like a king's crown.  As he neared it he felt all his strength, his courage, his fearlessness, leaving him; he could see these things drift from him on to the island.  They were as the clouds that rest on the mountains, grey-white and half transparent.  Weak as a woman he paddled back to the Indian village; he told them to go and search for 'The Island,' where they would find all his courage, his fearlessness and his strength, living, living forever. He slept then, but--in the morning he did not awake.  Since then our young men and our old have searched for 'The Island.'  It is there somewhere, up some lost channel, but we cannot find it.  When we do, we will get back all the courage and bravery we had before the white man came, for the great medicine man said those things never die--they live for one's children and grandchildren.\"\n\nHis voice ceased.  My whole heart went out to him in his longing for the lost island.  I thought of all the splendid courage I knew him to possess, so made answer: \"But you say that the shadow of this island has fallen upon you; is it not so, tillicum?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said half mournfully.  \"But only the shadow.\"\n\nPoint Grey\n\nHave you ever sailed around Point Grey?\" asked a young Squamish tillicum of mine who often comes to see me, to share a cup of tea and a taste of muck-a-muck, that otherwise I should eat in solitude.\n\n\"No,\" I admitted, I had not had that pleasure, for I did not know the uncertain waters of English Bay sufficiently well to venture about its headlands in my frail canoe.\n\n\"Some day, perhaps next summer, I'll take you there in a sail-boat, and show you the big rock at the southwest of the Point.  It is a strange rock; we Indian people call it Homolsom.\"\n\n\"What an odd name,\" I commented.  \"Is it a Squamish word?--it does not sound to me like one.\"\n\n\"It is not altogether Squamish, but half Fraser River language.  The Point was the dividing line between the grounds and waters of the two tribes, so they agreed to make the name 'Homolsom' from the two languages.\"\n\nI suggested more tea, and, as he sipped it, he told me the legend that few of the younger Indians know.  That he believes the story himself is beyond question, for many times he admitted having tested the virtues of this rock, and it had never once failed him.  All people that have to do with water craft are superstitious about some things, and I freely acknowledge that times innumerable I have \"whistled up\" a wind when dead calm threatened, or stuck a jack-knife in the mast, and afterwards watched with great contentment the idle sail fill, and the canoe pull out to a light breeze. So, perhaps, I am prejudiced in favor of this legend of Homolsom Rock, for it strikes a very responsive chord in that portion of my heart that has always throbbed for the sea.\n\n\"You know,\" began my young tillicum, \"that only waters unspoiled by human hands can be of any benefit.  One gains no strength by swimming in any waters heated or boiled by fires that men build.  To grow strong and wise one must swim in the natural rivers, the mountain torrents, the sea, just as the Sagalie Tyee made them.  Their virtues die when human beings try to improve them by heating or distilling, or placing even tea in them, and so--what makes Homolsom Rock so full of 'good medicine' is that the waters that wash up about it are straight from the sea, made by the hand of the Great Tyee, and unspoiled by the hand of man.\n\n\"It was not always there, that great rock, drawing its strength and its wonderful power from the seas, for it, too, was once a Great Tyee, who ruled a mighty tract of waters.  He was god of all the waters that wash the coast, of the Gulf of Georgia, of Puget Sound, of the Straits of Juan de Fuca, of the waters that beat against even the west coast of Vancouver Island, and of all the channels that cut between the Charlotte Islands.  He was Tyee of the West Wind, and his storms and tempests were so mighty that the Sagalie Tyee Himself could not control the havoc that he created.  He warred upon all fishing craft, he demolished canoes and sent men to graves in the sea.  He uprooted forests and drove the surf on shore heavy with wreckage of despoiled trees and with beaten and bruised fish. He did all this to reveal his powers, for he was cruel and hard of heart, and he would laugh and defy the Sagalie Tyee, and looking up to the sky he would call, 'See how powerful I am, how mighty, how strong; I am as great as you.'\n\n\"It was at this time that the Sagalie Tyee in the persons of the Four Men came in the great canoe up over the river of the Pacific, in that age thousands of years ago when they turned the evil into stone, and the kindly into trees.\n\n\"'Now,' said the god of the West Wind, 'I can show how great I am.  I shall blow a tempest that these men may not land on my coast.  They shall not ride my seas and sounds and channels in safety.  I shall wreck them and send their bodies into the great deeps, and I shall be Sagalie Tyee in their place and ruler of all the world.'  So the god of the West Wind blew forth his tempests.  The waves arose mountain high, the seas lashed and thundered along the shores.  The roar of his mighty breath could be heard wrenching giant limbs from the forest trees, whistling down the canyons and dealing death and destruction for leagues and leagues along the coast.  But the canoe containing the Four Men rode upright through all the heights and hollows of the seething ocean.  No curling crest or sullen depth could wreck that magic craft, for the hearts it bore were filled with kindness for the human race, and kindness cannot die.\n\n\"It was all rock and dense forest, and unpeopled; only wild animals and sea birds sought the shelter it provided from the terrors of the West Wind; but he drove them out in sullen anger, and made on this strip of land his last stand against the Four Men.  The Paleface calls the place Point Grey, but the Indians yet speak of it as 'The Battle Ground of the West Wind.'  All his mighty forces he now brought to bear against the oncoming canoe; he swept great hurricanes about its stony ledges; he caused the sea to beat and swirl in tempestuous fury along its narrow fastnesses, but the canoe came nearer and nearer, invincible as those shores, and stronger than death itself.  As the bow touched the land the Four Men arose and commanded the West Wind to cease his war cry, and, mighty though he had been, his voice trembled and sobbed itself into a gentle breeze, then fell to a whispering note, then faded into exquisite silence.\n\n\"'Oh, you evil one with the unkind heart,' cried the Four Men, 'you have been too great a god for even the Sagalie Tyee to obliterate you forever, but you shall live on, live now to serve, not to hinder mankind.  You shall turn into stone where you now stand, and you shall rise only as men wish you to.  Your life from this day shall be for the good of man, for when the fisherman's sails are idle and his lodge is leagues away you shall fill those sails and blow his craft free, in whatever direction he desires.  You shall stand where you are through all the thousands upon thousands of years to come, and he who touches you with his paddle-blade shall have his desire of a breeze to carry him home.'\"\n\nMy young tillicum had finished his tradition, and his great solemn eyes regarded me half-wistfully.\n\n\"I wish you could see Homolsom Rock,\" he said.  \"For that is he who was once the Tyee of the West Wind.\"\n\n\"Were you ever becalmed around Point Grey?\" I asked irrelevantly.\n\n\"Often,\" he replied.  \"But I paddle up to the rock and touch it with the tip of my paddle-blade, and no matter which way I want to go the wind will blow free for me, if I wait a little while.\"\n\n\"I suppose your people all do this?\" I replied.\n\n\"Yes, all of them,\" he answered.  \"They have done it for hundreds of years.  You see the power in it is just as great now as at first, for the rock feeds every day on the unspoiled sea that the Sagalie Tyee made.\"\n\nThe Tulameen Trail\n\nDid you ever \"holiday\" through the valley lands of the Dry Belt? Ever spend days and days in a swinging, swaying coach, behind a four-in-hand, when \"Curly\" or \"Nicola Ned\" held the ribbons, and tooled his knowing little leaders and wheelers down those horrifying mountain trails that wind like russet skeins of cobweb through the heights and depths of the Okanagan, the Nicola and the Similkameen countries?  If so, you have listened to the call of the Skookum Chuck, as the Chinook speakers call the rollicking, tumbling streams that sing their way through the canyons with a music so dulcet, so insistent, that for many moons the echo of it lingers in your listening ears, and you will, through all the years to come, hear the voices of those mountain rivers calling you to return.\n\nBut the most haunting of all the melodies\n\nis the warbling laughter of the Tulameen; its delicate note is far more powerful, more far-reaching than the throaty thunders of Niagara. That is why the Indians of the Nicola country still cling to their old-time story that the Tulameen carries the spirit of a young girl enmeshed in the wonders of its winding course; a spirit that can never free itself from the canyons, to rise above the heights and follow its fellows to the Happy Hunting Grounds, but which is contented to entwine its laughter, its sobs, its lonely whispers, its still lonelier call for companionship, with the wild music of the waters that sing forever beneath the western stars.\n\nAs your horses plod up and up the almost perpendicular trail that leads out of the Nicola Valley to the summit, a paradise of beauty outspreads at your feet; the color is indescribable in words, the atmosphere thrills you. Youth and the pulse of rioting blood are yours again, until, as you near the heights, you become strangely calmed by the voiceless silence of it all, a silence so holy that it seems the whole world about you is swinging its censer before an altar in some dim remote cathedral! The choir voices of the Tulameen are yet very far away across the summit, but the heights of the Nicola are the silent prayer that holds the human soul before the first great chords swell down from the organ loft.  In this first long climb up miles and miles of trail, even the staccato of the drivers' long black-snake whip is hushed.  He lets his animals pick their own sure-footed way, but once across the summit he gathers the reins in his steely fingers, gives a low, quick whistle, the whiplash curls about the ears of the leaders and the plunge down the dip of the mountain begins. Every foot of the way is done at a gallop. The coach rocks and swings as it dashes through a trail rough-hewn from the heart of the forest; at times the angles are so abrupt that you cannot see the heads of the leaders as they swing around the grey crags that almost scrape the tires on the left, while within a foot of the rim of the trail the right wheels whirl along the edge of a yawning canyon. The rhythms of the hoof-beats, the recurrent low whistle and crack of the whiplash, the occasional rattle of pebbles showering down to the depths, loosened by rioting wheels, have broken the sacred silence.  Yet above all those nearby sounds there seems to be an indistinct murmur, which grows sweeter, more musical, as you gain the base of the mountains, where it rises above all harsher notes.  It is the voice of the restless Tulameen as it dances and laughs through the rocky throat of the canyon, three hundred feet below. Then, following the song, comes a glimpse of the river itself--white garmented in the film of its countless rapids, its showers of waterfalls.  It is as beautiful to look at as to listen to, and it is here, where the trail winds about and above it for leagues, that the Indians say it caught the spirit of the maiden that is still interlaced in its loveliness.\n\nIt was in one of the terrible battles that raged between the valley tribes before the white man's footprints were seen along these trails.  None can now tell the cause of this warfare, but the supposition is that it was merely for tribal supremacy--that primeval instinct that assails the savage in both man and beast, that drives the hill men to bloodshed and the leaders of buffalo herds to conflict. It is the greed to rule; the one barbarous instinct that civilization has never yet been able to eradicate from armed nations. This war of the tribes of the valley lands was of years in duration; men fought and women mourned, and children wept, as all have done since time began.  It seemed an unequal battle, for the old experienced war-tried chief and his two astute sons were pitted against a single young Tulameen brave.  Both factions had their loyal followers, both were indomitable as to courage and bravery, both were determined and ambitious, both were skilled fighters.\n\nBut on the older man's side were experience and two other wary, strategic brains to help him, while on the younger was but the advantage of splendid youth and unconquerable persistence.  But at every pitched battle, at every skirmish, at every single-handed conflict the younger man gained little by little, the older man lost step by step.  The experience of age was gradually but inevitably giving way to the strength and enthusiasm of youth.  Then one day they met face to face and alone--the old war-scarred chief, the young battle-inspired brave.  It was an unequal combat, and at the close of a brief but violent struggle the younger had brought the older to his knees.  Standing over him with up-poised knife the Tulameen brave laughed sneeringly, and said:\n\n\"Would you, my enemy, have this victory as your own?  If so, I give it to you; but in return for my submission I demand of you-- your daughter.\"\n\nFor an instant the old chief looked in wonderment at his conqueror; he thought of his daughter only as a child who played about the forest trails or sat obediently beside her mother in the lodge, stitching her little moccasins or weaving her little baskets.\n\n\"My daughter!\" he answered sternly.  \"My daughter--who is barely out of her own cradle basket--give her to you, whose hands are blood-dyed with the killing of a score of my tribe?  You ask for this thing?\"\n\n\"I do not ask it,\" replied the young brave. \"I demand it; I have seen the girl and I shall have her.\"\n\nThe old chief sprang to his feet and spat out his refusal.  \"Keep your victory, and I keep my girl-child,\" though he knew he was not only defying his enemy, but defying death as well.\n\nThe Tulameen laughed lightly, easily.  \"I shall not kill the sire of my wife,\" he taunted. \"One more battle must we have, but your girl-child will come to me.\"\n\nThen he took his victorious way up the trail, while the old chief walked with slow and springless step down into the canyon.\n\nThe next morning the chief's daughter was loitering along the heights, listening to the singing river, and sometimes leaning over the precipice to watch its curling eddies and dancing waterfalls.  Suddenly she heard a slight rustle, as though some passing bird's wing had clipt the air.  Then at her feet there fell a slender, delicately shaped arrow.  It fell with spent force, and her Indian woodcraft told her it had been shot to her, not at her. She started like a wild animal.  Then her quick eye caught the outline of a handsome, erect figure that stood on the heights across the river.  She did not know him as her father's enemy.  She only saw him to be young, stalwart and of extraordinary, manly beauty.  The spirit of youth and of a certain savage coquetry awoke within her.  Quickly she fitted one of her own dainty arrows to the bow string and sent it winging across the narrow canyon; it fell, spent, at his feet, and he knew she had shot it to him, not at him.\n\nNext morning, woman-like, she crept noiselessly to the brink of the heights.  Would she see him again--that handsome brave?  Would he speed another arrow to her?  She had not yet emerged from the tangle of forest before it fell, its faint-winged flight heralding its coming.  Near the feathered end was tied a tassel of beautiful ermine tails.  She took from her wrist a string of shell beads, fastened it to one of her little arrows and winged it across the canyon, as yesterday.\n\nThe following morning before leaving the ledge she fastened the tassel of ermine tails in her straight, black hair.  Would he see them? But no arrow fell at her feet that day, but a clearer message was there on the brink of the precipice.  He himself awaited her coming-- he who had never left her thoughts since that first arrow came to her from his bow-string. His eyes burned with warm fires, as she approached, but his lips said simply: \"I have crossed the Tulameen River.\"  Together they stood, side by side, and looked down at the depths before them, watching in silence the little torrent rollicking and roystering over its boulders and crags.\n\n\"That is my country,\" he said, looking across the river.  \"This is the country of your father, and of your brothers; they are my enemies.  I return to my own shore tonight. Will you come with me?\"\n\nShe looked up into his handsome young face. So this was her father's foe--the dreaded Tulameen!\n\n\"Will you come?\" he repeated.\n\n\"I will come,\" she whispered.\n\nIt was in the dark of the moon and through the kindly night he led her far up the rocky shores to the narrow belt of quiet waters, where they crossed in silence into his own country.  A week, a month, a long golden summer, slipped by, but the insulted old chief and his enraged sons failed to find her.\n\nThen one morning as the lovers walked together on the heights above the far upper reaches of the river, even the ever-watchful eyes of the Tulameen failed to detect the lurking enemy.  Across the narrow canyon crouched and crept the two outwitted brothers of the girl-wife at his side; their arrows were on their bow-strings, their hearts on fire with hatred and vengeance.  Like two evil-winged birds of prey those arrows sped across the laughing river, but before they found their mark in the breast of the victorious Tulameen the girl had unconsciously stepped before him. With a little sigh, she slipped into his arms, her brothers' arrows buried into her soft, brown flesh.\n\nIt was many a moon before his avenging hand succeeded in slaying the old chief and those two hated sons of his.  But when this was finally done the handsome young Tulameen left his people, his tribe, his country, and went into the far north.  \"For,\" he said, as he sang his farewell war song, \"my heart lies dead in the Tulameen River.\"\n\n\n*****\n\nBut the spirit of his girl-wife still sings through the canyon, its song blending with the music of that sweetest-voiced river in all the great valleys of the Dry Belt.  That is why this laughter, the sobbing murmur of the beautiful Tulameen will haunt for evermore the ear that has once listened to its song.\n\nThe Grey Archway\n\nThe steamer, like a huge shuttle, wove in and out among the countless small islands; its long trailing scarf of grey smoke hung heavily along the uncertain shores, casting a shadow over the pearly waters of the Pacific, which sung lazily from rock to rock in indescribable beauty.\n\nAfter dinner I wandered astern with the traveller's ever-present hope of seeing the beauties of a typical Northern sunset, and by some happy chance I placed my deck stool near an old tillicum, who was leaning on the rail, his pipe between his thin curved lips, his brown hands clasped idly, his sombre eyes looking far out to sea, as though they searched the future--or was it that they were seeing the past?\n\n\"Kla-how-ya, tillicum!\" I greeted\n\nHe glanced round, and half smiled.\n\n\"Kla-how-ya, tillicum!\" he replied, with the warmth of friendliness I have always met with among the Pacific tribes.\n\nI drew my deck stool nearer to him, and he acknowledged the action with another half smile, but did not stir from his entrenchment, remaining as if hedged about with an inviolable fortress of exclusiveness.  Yet I knew that my Chinook salutation would be a drawbridge by which I might hope to cross the moat into his castle of silence.\n\nIndian-like, he took his time before continuing the acquaintance.  Then he began in most excellent English:\n\n\"You do not know these Northern waters?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\nAfter many moments he leaned forward, looking along the curve of the deck, up the channels and narrows we were threading, to a broad strip of waters off the port bow.  Then he pointed, with that peculiar, thoroughly Indian gesture of the palm, uppermost.\n\n\"Do you see it--over there?  The small island?  It rests on the edge of the water, like a grey gull.\"\n\nIt took my unaccustomed eyes some moments to discern it; then all at once I caught its outline, veiled in the mists of distance--grey, cobwebby, dreamy.\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"I see it now.  You will tell me of it--tillicum?\"\n\nHe gave a swift glance at my dark skin, then nodded.  \"You are one of us,\" he said, with evidently no thought of a possible contradiction.  \"And you will understand, or I should not tell you.  You will not smile at the story, for you are one of us.\"\n\n\"I am one of you, and I shall understand,\" I answered.\n\nIt was a full half-hour before we neared the island, yet neither of us spoke during that time; then, as the \"grey gull\" shaped itself into rock and tree and crag, I noticed in the very centre a stupendous pile of stone lifting itself skyward, without fissure or cleft; but a peculiar haziness about the base made me peer narrowly to catch the perfect outline.\n\n\"It is the 'Grey Archway,'\" he explained, simply.\n\nOnly then did I grasp the singular formation before us; the rock was a perfect archway, through which we could see the placid Pacific shimmering in the growing colors of the coming sunset at the opposite rim of the island.\n\n\"What a remarkable whim of Nature!\" I exclaimed, but his brown hand was laid in a contradictory grasp on my arm, and he snatched up my comment almost with impatience.\n\n\"No, it was not Nature,\" he said.  \"That is the reason I say you will understand--you are one of us--you will know what I tell you is true.  The Great Tyee did not make that archway, it was--\" here his voice lowered-- \"it was magic, red man's medicine and magic --you savvy?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.  \"Tell me, for I--savvy.\"\n\n\"Long time ago,\" he began, stumbling into a half-broken English language, because, I think, of the atmosphere and environment, \"long before you were born, or your father, or grandfather, or even his father, this strange thing happened.  It is a story for women to hear, to remember.  Women are the future mothers of the tribe, and we of the Pacific Coast hold such in high regard, in great reverence. The women who are mothers--o-ho!-- they are the important ones we say.  Warriors, fighters, brave men, fearless daughters, owe their qualities to these mothers--eh, is it not always so?\"\n\nI nodded silently.  The island was swinging nearer to us, the \"Grey Archway\" loomed almost above us, the mysticism crowded close, it enveloped me, caressed me, appealed to me.\n\n\"And?\" I hinted.\n\n\"And,\" he proceeded, \"this 'Grey Archway' is a story of mothers, of magic, of witchcraft, of warriors, of--love.\"\n\nAn Indian rarely uses the word \"love,\" and when he does it expresses every quality, every attribute, every intensity, emotion and passion embraced in those four little letters.  Surely this was an exceptional story I was to hear.\n\nI did not answer, only looked across the pulsing waters toward the \"Grey Archway,\" which the sinking sun was touching with soft pastels, tints one could give no name to, beauties impossible to describe.\n\n\"You have not heard of Yaada?\" he questioned. Then fortunately he continued without waiting for a reply.  He well knew that I had never heard of Yaada, so why not begin without preliminary to tell me of her?--so--\n\n\"Yaada was the loveliest daughter of the Haida tribe.  Young braves from all the islands, from the mainland, from the upper Skeena country came, hoping to carry her to their far-off lodges, but they always returned alone. She was the most desired of all the island maidens, beautiful, brave, modest, the daughter of her own mother.\n\n\"But there was a great man, a very great man--a medicine man, skilful, powerful, influential, old, deplorably old, and very, very rich; he said, 'Yaada shall be my wife.'  And there was a young fisherman, handsome, loyal, boyish, poor, oh! very poor, and gloriously young, and he, too, said, 'Yaada shall be my wife.'\n\n\"But Yaada's mother sat apart and thought and dreamed, as mothers will.  She said to herself, 'The great medicine man has power, has vast riches, and wonderful magic, why not give her to him?  But Ulka has the boy's heart, the boy's beauty, he is very brave, very strong; why not give her to him?'\n\n\"But the laws of the great Haida tribe prevailed. Its wise men said, 'Give the girl to the greatest man, give her to the most powerful, the richest.  The man of magic must have his choice.'\n\n\"But at this the mother's heart grew as wax in the summer sunshine--it is a strange quality that mothers' hearts are made of! 'Give her to the best man--the man her heart holds highest,' said this Haida mother.\n\n\"Then Yaada spoke: 'I am the daughter of my tribe; I would judge of men by their excellence.  He who proves most worthy I shall marry; it is not riches that make a good husband; it is not beauty that makes a good father for one's children.  Let me and my tribe see some proof of the excellence of these two men--then, only, shall I choose who is to be the father of my children.  Let us have a trial of their skill; let them show me how evil or how beautiful is the inside of their hearts. Let each of them throw a stone with some intent, some purpose in their hearts.  He who makes the noblest mark may call me wife.'\n\n\"'Alas!  Alas!' wailed the Haida mother 'This casting of stones does not show worth. It but shows prowess.'\n\n\"'But I have implored the Sagalie Tyee of my father, and of his fathers before him, to help me to judge between them by this means,' said the girl.  'So they must cast the stones.  In this way only shall I see their innermost hearts.'\n\n\"The medicine man never looked so old as at that moment; so hopelessly old, so wrinkled, so palsied: he was no mate for Yaada.  Ulka never looked so god-like in his young beauty, so gloriously young, so courageous.  The girl, looking at him, loved him--almost was she placing her hand in his, but the spirit of her forefathers halted her.  She had spoken the word--she must abide by it.  'Throw!' she commanded.\n\n\"Into his shrivelled fingers the great medicine man took a small, round stone, chanting strange words of magic all the while; his greedy eyes were on the girl, his greedy thoughts about her.\n\n\"Into his strong, young fingers Ulka took a smooth, flat stone; his handsome eyes were lowered in boyish modesty, his thoughts were worshipping her.  The great medicine man cast his missile first; it swept through the air like a shaft of lightning, striking the great rock with a force that shattered it.  At the touch of that stone the 'Grey Archway' opened and has remained opened to this day.\n\n\"'Oh, wonderful power and magic!' clamored the entire tribe.  'The very rocks do his bidding.'\n\n\"But Yaada stood with eyes that burned in agony.  Ulka could never command such magic--she knew it.  But at her side Ulka was standing erect, tall, slender and beautiful, but just as he cast his missile the evil voice of the old medicine man began a still more evil incantation.  He fixed his poisonous eyes on the younger man, eyes with hideous magic in their depths--ill-omened and enchanted with 'bad medicine.'  The stone left Ulka's fingers; for a second it flew forth in a straight line, then as the evil voice of the old man grew louder in its incantations the stone curved. Magic had waylaid the strong arm of the young brave.  The stone poised an instant above the forehead of Yaada's mother, then dropped with the weight of many mountains, and the last long sleep fell upon her.\n\n\"'Slayer of my mother!' stormed the girl, her suffering eyes fixed upon the medicine man.  'Oh, I now see your black heart through your black magic.  Through good magic you cut the 'Grey Archway,' but your evil magic you used upon young Ulka.  I saw your wicked eyes upon him; I heard your wicked incantations; I know your wicked heart.  You used your heartless magic in hope of winning me--in hope of making him an outcast of the tribe.  You cared not for my sorrowing heart, my motherless life to come.'  Then, turning to the tribe, she demanded: 'Who of you saw his evil eyes fixed on Ulka?  Who of you heard his evil song?'\n\n\"'I,' and 'I,' and 'I,' came voice after voice.\n\n\"'The very air is poisoned that we breathe about him,' they shouted.  'The young man is blameless, his heart is as the sun, but the man who has used his evil magic has a heart black and cold as the hours before the dawn.'\n\n\"Then Yaada's voice arose in a strange, sweet, sorrowful chant:\n\nMy feet shall walk no more upon this island,\n\nWith its great, Grey Archway.\n\nMy mother sleeps forever on this island,\n\nWith its great, Grey Archway.\n\nMy heart would break without her on this island,\n\nWith its great, Grey Archway.\n\nMy life was of her life upon this island,\n\nWith its great, Grey Archway.\n\nMy mother's soul has wandered from this island,\n\nWith its great, Grey Archway.\n\nMy feet must follow hers beyond this island,\n\nWith its great, Grey Archway.\n\n\"As Yaada chanted and wailed her farewell, she moved slowly towards the edge of the cliff.  On its brink she hovered a moment with outstretched arms, as a sea gull poises on its weight--then she called:\n\n\"'Ulka, my Ulka!  Your hand is innocent of wrong; it was the evil magic of your rival that slew my mother.  I must go to her; even you cannot keep me here; will you stay, or come with me?  Oh! my Ulka!\"\n\n\"The slender, gloriously young boy sprang toward her; their hands closed one within the other; for a second they poised on the brink of the rocks, radiant as stars; then together they plunged into the sea.\"\n\n\n*******\n\nThe legend was ended.  Long ago we had passed the island with its \"Grey Archway\"; it was melting into the twilight, far astern.\n\nAs I brooded over this strange tale of a daughter's devotion, I watched the sea and sky for something that would give me a clue to the inevitable sequel that the tillicum, like all his race, was surely withholding until the opportune moment.\n\nSomething flashed through the darkening waters not a stone's throw from the steamer. I leaned forward, watching it intently.  Two silvery fish were making a succession of little leaps and plunges along the surface of the sea, their bodies catching the last tints of sunset, like flashing jewels.  I looked at the tillicum quickly.  He was watching me--a world of anxiety in his half-mournful eyes.\n\n\"And those two silvery fish?\" I questioned.\n\nHe smiled.  The anxious look vanished.  \"I was right,\" he said; \"you do know us and our ways, for you are one of us.  Yes, those fish are seen only in these waters; there are never but two of them.  They are Yaada and her mate, seeking for the soul of the Haida woman --her mother.\"\n\nDeadman's Island\n\nIt is dusk on the Lost Lagoon, And we two dreaming the dusk away, Beneath the drift of a twilight grey-- Beneath the drowse of an ending day And the curve of a golden moon.\n\nIt is dark in the Lost Lagoon, And gone are the depths of haunting blue, The grouping gulls, and the old canoe, The singing firs, and the dusk and--you, And gone is the golden moon.\n\nO! lure of the Lost Lagoon-- I dream tonight that my paddle blurs The purple shade where the seaweed stirs-- I hear the call of the singing firs In the hush of the golden moon.\n\nFor many minutes we stood silently, leaning on the western rail of the bridge as we watched the sun set across that beautiful little basin of water known as Coal Harbor.  I have always resented that jarring, unattractive name, for years ago, when I first plied paddle across the gunwale of a light little canoe that idled above its margin, I named the sheltered little cove the Lost Lagoon. This was just to please my own fancy, for as that perfect summer month drifted on, the ever-restless tides left the harbor devoid of water at my favorite canoeing hour, and my pet idling place was lost for many days-- hence my fancy to call it the Lost Lagoon. But the chief, Indian-like, immediately adopted the name, at least when he spoke of the place to me, and as we watched the sun slip behind the rim of firs, he expressed the wish that his dugout were here instead of lying beached at the farther side of the park.\n\n\"If canoe was here, you and I we paddle close to shores all 'round your Lost Lagoon: we make track just like half moon.  Then we paddle under this bridge, and go channel between Deadman's Island and park.  Then 'round where cannon speak time at nine o'clock.  Then 'cross Inlet to Indian side of Narrows.\"\n\nI turned to look eastward, following in fancy the course he had sketched; the waters were still as the footstep of the oncoming twilight, and, floating in a pool of soft purple, Deadman's Island rested like a large circle of candle moss.\n\n\"Have you ever been on it?\" he asked as he caught my gaze centering on the irregular outline of the island pines.\n\n\"I have prowled the length and depth of it,\" I told him.  \"Climbed over every rock on its shores, crept under every tangled growth of its interior, explored its overgrown trails, and more than once nearly got lost in its very heart.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he half laughed, \"it pretty wild; not much good for anything.\"\n\n\"People seem to think it valuable,\" I said. \"There is a lot of litigation--of fighting going on now about it.\"\n\n\"Oh! that the way always,\" he said as though speaking of a long accepted fact.  \"Always fight over that place.  Hundreds of years ago they fight about it; Indian people; they say hundreds of years to come everybody will still fight--never be settled what that place is, who it belong to, who has right to it. No, never settle.  Deadman's Island always mean fight for someone.\"\n\n\"So the Indians fought amongst themselves about it?\" I remarked, seemingly without guile, although my ears tingled for the legend I knew was coming.\n\n\"Fought like lynx at close quarters,\" he answered.  \"Fought, killed each other, until the island ran with blood redder than that sunset, and the sea water about it was stained flame color--it was then, my people say, that the scarlet fire-flower was first seen growing along this coast.\"\n\n\"It is a beautiful color--the fire-flower,\" I said.\n\n\"It should be fine color, for it was born and grew from the hearts of fine tribes-people-- very fine people,\" he emphasized.\n\nWe crossed to the eastern rail of the bridge, and stood watching the deep shadows that gathered slowly and silently about the island; I have seldom looked upon anything more peaceful.\n\nThe chief sighed.  \"We have no such men now, no fighters like those men, no hearts, no courage like theirs.  But I tell you the story; you understand it then.  Now all peace; tonight all good tillicums; even dead man's spirit does not fight now, but long time after it happen those spirits fought.\"\n\n\"And the legend?\" I ventured.\n\n\"Oh! yes,\" he replied, as if suddenly returning to the present from out a far country in the realm of time.  \"Indian people, they call it the 'Legend of the Island of Dead Men.'\n\n\"There was war everywhere.  Fierce tribes from the northern coast, savage tribes from the south all met here and battled and raided, burned and captured, tortured and killed their enemies.  The forests smoked with camp fires, the Narrows were choked with war canoes, and the Sagalie Tyee--He who is a man of peace--turned His face away from His Indian children.  About this island there was dispute and contention.  The medicine men from the North claimed it as their chanting ground. The medicine men from the South laid equal claim to it.  Each wanted it as the stronghold of their witchcraft, their magic.  Great bands of these medicine men met on the small space, using every sorcery in their power to drive their opponents away.  The witch doctors of the North made their camp on the northern rim of the island; those from the South settled along the southern edge, looking towards what is now the great city of Vancouver. Both factions danced, chanted, burned their magic powders, built their magic fires, beat their magic rattles, but neither would give way, yet neither conquered.  About them, on the waters, on the mainlands, raged the warfare of their respective tribes--the Sagalie Tyee had forgotten His Indian children.\n\n\"After many months, the warriors on both sides weakened.  They said the incantations of the rival medicine men were bewitching them, were making their hearts like children's, and their arms nerveless as women's.  So friend and foe arose as one man and drove the medicine men from the island, hounded them down the Inlet, herded them through the Narrows and banished them out to sea, where they took refuge on one of the outer islands of the gulf.  Then the tribes once more fell upon each other in battle.\n\n\"The warrior blood of the North will always conquer.  They are the stronger, bolder, more alert, more keen.  The snows and the ice of their country make swifter pulse than the sleepy suns of the South can awake in a man; their muscles are of sterner stuff, their endurance greater.  Yes, the northern tribes will always be victors.\\*  But the craft and the strategy of the southern tribes are hard things to battle against.  While those of the North followed the medicine men farther out to sea to make sure of their banishment, those from the South returned under cover of night and seized the women and children and the old, enfeebled men in their enemy's camp, transported them all to the Island of Dead Men, and there held them as captives.  Their war canoes circled the island like a fortification, through which drifted the sobs of the imprisoned women, the mutterings of the aged men, the wail of little children.\n\n\"Again and again the men of the North assailed that circle of canoes, and again and again were repulsed.  The air was thick with poisoned arrows, the water stained with blood. But day by day the circle of southern canoes grew thinner and thinner; the northern arrows were telling and truer of aim.  Canoes drifted everywhere, empty, or worse still, manned only by dead men.  The pick of the southern warriors had already fallen, when their greatest Tyee mounted a large rock on the eastern shore.  Brave and unmindful of a thousand weapons aimed at his heart, he uplifted his\n\n* Note.--It would almost seem that the chief knew that wonderful poem of \"The Khan's,\" \"The Men of the Northern Zone,\" wherein he says:\n\n  If ever a Northman lost a throne\n\n  Did the conqueror come from the South?\n\n  Nay, the North shall ever be free . . . etc.\n\nhand, palm outward--the signal for conference.  Instantly every northern arrow was lowered, and every northern ear listened for his words.\n\n\"'Oh! men of the upper coast,' he said, 'you are more numerous than we are; your tribe is larger; your endurance greater.  We are growing hungry, we are growing less in numbers. Our captives--your women and children and old men--have lessened, too, our stores of food.  If you refuse our terms we will yet fight to the finish.  Tomorrow we will kill all our captives before your eyes, for we can feed them no longer, or you can have your wives, your mothers, your fathers, your children, by giving us for each and every one of them one of your best and bravest young warriors, who will consent to suffer death in their stead. Speak!  You have your choice.'\n\n\"In the northern canoes scores and scores of young warriors leapt to their feet.  The air was filled with glad cries, with exultant shouts.  The whole world seemed to ring with the voices of those young men who called loudly, with glorious courage:\n\n\"'Take me, but give me back my old father.'\n\n\"'Take me, but spare to my tribe my little sister.'\n\n\"'Take me, but release my wife and boy-baby.'\n\n\"So the compact was made.  Two hundred heroic, magnificent young men paddled up to the island, broke through the fortifying circle of canoes and stepped ashore.  They flaunted their eagle plumes with the spirit and boldness of young gods.  Their shoulders were erect, their step was firm, their hearts strong.  Into their canoes they crowded the two hundred captives. Once more their women sobbed, their old men muttered, their children wailed, but those young copper-colored gods never flinched, never faltered.  Their weak and their feeble were saved.  What mattered to them such a little thing as death?\n\n\"The released captives were quickly surrounded by their own people, but the flower of their splendid nation was in the hands of their enemies, those valorous young men who thought so little of life that they willingly, gladly laid it down to serve and to save those they loved and cared for.  Amongst them were war-tried warriors who had fought fifty battles, and boys not yet full grown, who were drawing a bow string for the first time, but their hearts, their courage, their self-sacrifice were as one.\n\n\"Out before a long file of southern warriors they stood.  Their chins uplifted, their eyes defiant, their breasts bared.  Each leaned forward and laid his weapons at his feet, then stood erect, with empty hands, and laughed forth their challenge to death.  A thousand arrows ripped the air, two hundred gallant northern throats flung forth a death cry exultant, triumphant as conquering kings--then two hundred fearless northern hearts ceased to beat.\n\n\"But in the morning the southern tribes found the spot where they fell peopled with flaming fire-flowers.  Dread terror seized upon them.  They abandoned the island, and when night again shrouded them they manned their canoes and noiselessly slipped through the Narrows, turned their bows southward and this coast line knew them no more.\"\n\n\"What glorious men,\" I half whispered as the chief concluded the strange legend.\n\n\"Yes, men!\" he echoed.  \"The white people call it Deadman's Island.  That is their way; but we of the Squamish call it The Island of Dead Men.\"\n\nThe clustering pines and the outlines of the island's margin were now dusky and indistinct. Peace, peace lay over the waters, and the purple of the summer twilight had turned to grey, but I knew that in the depths of the undergrowth on Deadman's Island there blossomed a flower of flaming beauty; its colors were veiled in the coming nightfall, but somewhere down in the sanctuary of its petals pulsed the heart's blood of many and valiant men.\n\nA Squamish Legend of Napoleon\n\nHolding an important place among the majority of curious tales held in veneration by the coast tribes are those of the sea-serpent.  The monster appears and reappears with almost monotonous frequency in connection with history, traditions, legends and superstitions; but perhaps the most wonderful part it ever played was in the great drama that held the stage of Europe, and incidentally all the world during the stormy days of the first Napoleon.\n\nThroughout Canada I have never failed to find an amazing knowledge of Napoleon Bonaparte amongst the very old and \"uncivilized\" Indians.  Perhaps they may be unfamiliar with every other historical character from Adam down, but they will all tell you they have heard of the \"Great French Fighter,\" as they call the wonderful little Corsican.\n\nWhether this knowledge was obtained through the fact that our earliest settlers and pioneers were French, or whether Napoleon's almost magical fighting career attracted the Indian mind to the exclusion of lesser warriors, I have never yet decided.  But the fact remains that the Indians of our generation are not as familiar with Bonaparte's name as were their fathers and grandfathers, so either the predominance of English-speaking settlers or the thinning of their ancient war-loving blood by modern civilization and peaceful times, must one or the other account for the younger Indian's ignorance of the Emperor of the French.\n\nIn telling me the legend of The Lost Talisman, my good tillicum, the late Chief Capilano, began the story with the almost amazing question, Had I ever heard of Napoleon Bonaparte? It was some moments before I just caught the name, for his English, always quaint and beautiful, was at times a little halting; but when he said by way of explanation, \"You know big fighter, Frenchman.  The English they beat him in big battle,\" I grasped immediately of whom he spoke.\n\n\"What do you know of him?\" I asked.\n\nHis voice lowered, almost as if he spoke a state secret.  \"I know how it is that English they beat him.\"\n\nI have read many historians on this event, but to hear the Squamish version was a novel and absorbing thing.  \"Yes?\" I said--my usual \"leading\" word to lure him into channels of tradition.\n\n\"Yes,\" he affirmed.  Then, still in a half whisper, he proceeded to tell me that it all happened through the agency of a single joint from the vertebra of a sea-serpent.\n\nIn telling me the story of Brockton Point and the valiant boy who killed the monster, he dwelt lightly on the fact that all people who approach the vicinity of the creature are palsied, both mentally and physically--bewitched, in fact--so that their bones become disjointed and their brains incapable; but today he elaborated upon this peculiarity until I harked back to the boy of Brockton Point and asked how it was that his body and brain escaped this affliction.\n\n\"He was all good, and had no greed,\" he replied. \"He proof against all bad things.\"\n\nI nodded understandingly, and he proceeded to tell me that all successful Indian fighters and warriors carried somewhere about their person a joint of a sea-serpent's vertebra, that the medicine men threw \"the power\" about them so that they were not personally affected by this little \"charm,\" but that immediately they approached an enemy the \"charm\" worked disaster, and victory was assured the fortunate possessor of the talisman.  There was one particularly effective joint that had been treasured and carried by the warriors of a great Squamish family for a century.  These warriors had conquered every foe they encountered, until the talisman had become so renowned that the totem pole of their entire \"clan\" was remodelled, and the new one crested by the figure of a single joint of a sea-serpent's vertebra.\n\nAbout this time stories of Napoleon's first great achievements drifted across the seas; not across the land--and just here may be a clue to buried, coast-Indian history, which those who are cleverer at research than I, can puzzle over.  The chief was most emphatic about the source of Indian knowledge of Napoleon.\n\n\"I suppose you heard of him from Quebec, through, perhaps, some of the French priests,\" I remarked.\n\n\"No, no,\" he contradicted hurriedly.  \"Not from East; we hear it from over the Pacific, from the place they call Russia.\"  But who conveyed the news or by what means it came he could not further enlighten me.  But a strange thing happened to the Squamish family about this time.  There was a large blood connection, but the only male member living was a very old warrior, the hero of many battles, and the possessor of the talisman. On his death-bed his women of three generations gathered about him; his wife, his sisters, his daughters, his granddaughters, but not one man, nor yet a boy of his own blood stood by to speed his departing warrior spirit to the land of peace and plenty.\n\n\"The charm cannot rest in the hands of women,\" he murmured almost with his last breath.  \"Women may not war and fight other nations or other tribes; women are for the peaceful lodge and for the leading of little children.  They are for holding baby hands, teaching baby feet to walk.  No, the charm cannot rest with you, women.  I have no brother, no cousin, no son, no grandson, and the charm must not go to a lesser warrior than I.  None of our tribe, nor of any tribe on the coast, ever conquered me.  The charm must go to one as unconquerable as I have been.  When I am dead send it across the great salt chuck, to the victorious 'Frenchman'; they call him Napoleon Bonaparte.\" They were his last words.\n\nThe older women wished to bury the charm with him, but the younger women, inspired with the spirit of their generation, were determined to send it over seas.  \"In the grave it will be dead,\" they argued.  \"Let it still live on.  Let it help some other fighter to greatness and victory.\"\n\nAs if to confirm their decision, the next day a small sealing vessel anchored in the Inlet. All the men aboard spoke Russian, save two thin, dark, agile sailors, who kept aloof from the crew and conversed in another language. These two came ashore with part of the crew and talked in French with a wandering Hudson's Bay trapper, who often lodged with the Squamish people.  Thus the women, who yet mourned over their dead warrior, knew these two strangers to be from the land where the great \"Frenchman\" was fighting against the world.\n\nHere I interrupted the chief.  \"How came the Frenchmen in a Russian sealer?\" I asked.\n\n\"Captives,\" he replied.  \"Almost slaves, and hated by their captors, as the majority always hate the few.  So the women drew those two Frenchmen apart from the rest and told them the story of the bone of the sea-serpent, urging them to carry it back to their own country and give it to the great 'Frenchman' who was as courageous and as brave as their dead leader.\n\n\"The Frenchmen hesitated; the talisman might affect them, they said; might jangle their own brains, so that on their return to Russia they would not have the sagacity to plan an escape to their own country; might disjoint their bodies, so that their feet and hands would be useless, and they would become as weak as children.  But the women assured them that the charm only worked its magical powers over a man's enemies, that the ancient medicine men had 'bewitched' it with this quality.  So the Frenchmen took it and promised that if it were in the power of man they would convey it to 'the Emperor.'\n\n\"As the crew boarded the sealer, the women watching from the shore observed strange contortions seize many of the men; some fell on the deck; some crouched, shaking as with palsy; some writhed for a moment, then fell limp and seemingly boneless; only the two Frenchmen stood erect and strong and vital --the Squamish talisman had already overcome their foes.  As the little sealer set sail up the gulf she was commanded by a crew of two Frenchmen--men who had entered these waters as captives, who were leaving them as conquerors.  The palsied Russians were worse than useless, and what became of them the chief could not state; presumably they were flung overboard, and by some trick of a kindly fate the Frenchmen at last reached the coast of France.\n\nTradition is so indefinite about their movements subsequent to sailing out of the Inlet, that even the ever-romantic and vividly colored imaginations of the Squamish people have never supplied the details of this beautifully childish, yet strangely historical fairy tale.  But the voices of the trumpets of war, the beat of drums throughout Europe heralded back to the wilds of the Pacific Coast forests the intelligence that the great Squamish 'charm' eventually reached the person of Napoleon; that from this time onward his career was one vast victory, that he won battle after battle, conquered nation after nation, and but for the direst calamity that could befall a warrior would eventually have been master of the world.\n\n\"What was this calamity, Chief?\" I asked, amazed at his knowledge of the great historical soldier and strategist.\n\nThe chief's voice again lowered to a whisper --his face was almost rigid with intentness as he replied:\n\n\"He lost the Squamish charm--lost it just before one great fight with the English people.\"\n\nI looked at him curiously; he had been telling me the oddest mixture of history and superstition, of intelligence and ignorance, the most whimsically absurd, yet impressive, tale I ever heard from Indian lips.\n\n\"What was the name of the great fight-- did you ever hear it?\" I asked, wondering how much he knew of events which took place at the other side of the world a century agone.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, carefully, thoughtfully; \"I hear the name sometime in London when I there.  Railroad station there--same name.\"\n\n\"Was it Waterloo?\" I asked.\n\nHe nodded quickly, without a shadow of hesitation.  \"That the one,\" he replied; \"that's it, Waterloo.\"\n\nThe Lure in Stanley Park\n\nThere is a well-known trail in Stanley Park that leads to what I always love to call the \"Cathedral Trees\"--that group of some half-dozen forest giants that arch overhead with such superb loftiness.  But in all the world there is no cathedral whose marble or onyx columns can vie with those straight, clean, brown cedar boles that teem with the sap and blood of life.  There is no fresco that can rival the delicacy of lace-work they have festooned between you and the far skies.  No tiles, no mosaic or inlaid marbles, are as fascinating as the bare, russet, fragrant floor outspreading about their feet.  They are the acme of Nature's architecture, and in building them she has outrivalled all her erstwhile conceptions.  She will never originate a more faultless design, never erect a more perfect edifice.  But the divinely moulded cedars and the man-made cathedral have one exquisite characteristic in common.  It is the atmosphere of holiness.  Most of us have better impulses after viewing a stately cathedral, and none of us can stand amid that majestic group of cedars without experiencing some elevating thoughts, some refinement of our coarser nature.  Perhaps those who read this little legend will never again stand amid those cathedral trees without thinking of the glorious souls they contain, for according to the Coast Indians they do harbor human souls, and the world is better because they once had the speech and the hearts of mighty men.\n\nMy tillicum did not use the word \"lure\" in telling me this legend.  There is no equivalent for the word in the Chinook tongue, but the gestures of his voiceful hands so expressed the quality of something between magnetism and charm that I have selected this word \"lure\" as best fitting what he wished to convey. Some few yards beyond the cathedral trees, an overgrown disused trail turns into the dense wilderness to the right.  Only Indian eyes could discern that trail, and the Indians do not willingly go to that part of the park to the right of the cedar group.  Nothing in this, nor yet the next world would tempt a Coast Indian into the compact centres of the wild portions of the park, for therein, concealed cunningly, is the \"lure\" they all believe in. There is not a tribe in the entire district that does not know of this strange legend.  You will hear the tale from those that gather at Eagle Harbor for the fishing, from the Fraser River tribes, from the Squamish at the Narrows, from the Mission, from up the Inlet, even from the tribes at North Bend, but no one will volunteer to be your guide, for having once come within the \"aura\" of the lure it is a human impossibility to leave it.  Your willpower is dwarfed, your intelligence blighted, your feet will refuse to lead you out by a straight trail, you will circle, circle for evermore about this magnet, for if death kindly comes to your aid your immortal spirit will go on in that endless circling that will bar it from entering the Happy Hunting Grounds.\n\nAnd, like the cathedral trees, the lure once lived, a human soul, but in this instance it was a soul depraved, not sanctified.  The Indian belief is very beautiful concerning the results of good and evil in the human body. The Sagalie Tyee (God) has His own way of immortalizing each.  People who are wilfully evil, who have no kindness in their hearts, who are bloodthirsty, cruel, vengeful, unsympathetic, the Sagalie Tyee turns to solid stone that will harbor no growth, even that of moss or lichen, for these stones contain no moisture, just as their wicked hearts lacked the milk of human kindness.  The one famed exception, wherein a good man was transformed into stone, was in the instance of Siwash Rock, but as the Indian tells you of it he smiles with gratification as he calls your attention to the tiny tree cresting that imperial monument.  He says the tree was always there to show the nations that the good in this man's heart kept on growing even when his body had ceased to be.  On the other hand the Sagalie Tyee transforms the kindly people, the humane, sympathetic, charitable-loving people into trees, so that after death they may go on forever benefiting all mankind; they may yield fruit, give shade and shelter, afford unending service to the living, by their usefulness as building material and as firewood.  Their saps and gums, their fibres, their leaves, their blossoms, enrich, nourish and sustain the human form; no evil is produced by trees--all, all is goodness, is hearty, is helpfulness and growth. They give refuge to the birds, they give music to the winds, and from them are carved the bows and arrows, the canoes and paddles, bowls, spoons and baskets.  Their service to mankind is priceless; the Indian that tells you this tale will enumerate all these attributes and virtues of these trees.  No wonder the Sagalie Tyee chose them to be the abode of souls good and great.\n\nBut the lure in Stanley Park is that most dreaded of all things, an evil soul.  It is embodied in a bare, white stone, which is shunned by moss and vine and lichen, but over which are splashed innumerable jet-black spots that have eaten into the surface like an acid.\n\nThis condemned soul once animated the body of a witch-woman, who went up and down the coast, over seas and far inland, casting her evil eye on innocent people, and bringing them untold evils and diseases.  About her person she carried the renowned \"Bad Medicine\" that every Indian believes in-- medicine that weakened the arm of the warrior in battle, that caused deformities, that poisoned minds and characters, that engendered madness, that bred plagues and epidemics; in short, that was the seed of every evil that could befall mankind.  This witch-woman herself was immune from death; generations were born and grew to old age, and died, and other generations arose in their stead, but the witch-woman went about, her heart set against her kind; her acts were evil, her purposes wicked, she broke hearts and bodies and souls; she gloried in tears, and revelled in unhappiness, and sent them broadcast wherever she wandered.  And in his high heaven the Sagalie Tyee wept with sorrow for his afflicted human children.  He dared not let her die, for her spirit would still go on with its evil doing.  In mighty anger he gave command to his Four Men (always representing the Deity) that they should turn this witch-woman into a stone and enchain her spirit in its centre, that the curse of her might be lifted from the unhappy race.\n\nSo the Four Men entered their giant canoe, and headed, as was their custom, up the Narrows. As they neared what is now known as Prospect Point they heard from the heights above them a laugh, and looking up they beheld the witch-woman jeering defiantly at them.  They landed and, scaling the rocks, pursued her as she danced away, eluding them like a will-o'-the-wisp as she called out to them sneeringly:\n\n\"Care for yourselves, oh! men of the Sagalie Tyee, or I shall blight you with my evil eye.  Care for yourselves and do not follow me.\"  On and on she danced through the thickest of the wilderness, on and on they followed until they reached the very heart of the seagirt neck of land we know as Stanley Park.  Then the tallest, the mightiest of the Four Men, lifted his hand and cried out: \"Oh! woman of the stony heart, be stone for evermore, and bear forever a black stain for each one of your evil deeds.\"  And as he spoke the witch-woman was transformed into this stone that tradition says is in the centre of the park.\n\nSuch is the legend of the Lure, whether or not this stone is really in existence--who knows?  One thing is positive, however, no Indian will ever help to discover it.\n\nThree different Indians have told me that fifteen or eighteen years ago two tourists--a man and a woman--were lost in Stanley Park. When found a week later, the man was dead, the woman mad, and each of my informants firmly believed they had, in their wanderings, encountered \"the stone\" and were compelled to circle around it, because of its powerful lure.\n\nBut this wild tale fortunately has a most beautiful conclusion.  The Four Men, fearing that the evil heart imprisoned in the stone would still work destruction, said: \"At the end of the trail we must place so good and great a thing that it will be mightier, stronger, more powerful than this evil.\"  So they chose from the nations the kindliest, most benevolent men, men whose hearts were filled with the love of their fellow-beings, and transformed these merciful souls into the stately group of \"Cathedral Trees.\"\n\nHow well the purpose of the Sagalie Tyee has wrought its effect through time!  The good has predominated as He planned it to, for is not the stone hidden in some unknown part of the park where eyes do not see it and feet do not follow--and do not the thousands who come to us from the nethermost parts of the world seek that wondrous beauty spot, and stand awed by the majestic silence, the almost holiness of that group of giant cedars?\n\nMore than any other legend that the Indians about Vancouver have told me does this tale reveal the love of the Coast native for kindness, and his hatred of cruelty.  If these tribes really have ever been a warlike race I cannot think they pride themselves much on the occupation. If you talk with any of them and they mention some man they particularly like or admire, their first qualification of him is: \"He's a kind man.\"  They never say he is brave, or rich, or successful, or even strong, that characteristic so loved by the red man.  To these Coast tribes if a man is \"kind\" he is everything. And almost without exception their legends deal with rewards for tenderness and self-abnegation, and personal and mental cleanliness.\n\nCall them fairy tales if you wish to, they all have a reasonableness that must have originated in some mighty mind, and better than that, they all tell of the Indian's faith in the survival of the best impulses of the human heart, and the ultimate extinction of the worst.\n\nIn talking with my many good tillicums, I find this witch-woman legend is the most universally known and thoroughly believed in of all traditions they have honored me by revealing to me.\n\nDeer Lake\n\nFew white men ventured inland, a century ago, in the days of the first Chief Capilano, when the spoils of the mighty Fraser River poured into copper-colored hands, but did not find their way to the remotest corners of the earth, as in our times, when the gold from its sources, the salmon from its mouth, the timber from its shores are world-known riches.\n\nThe fisherman's craft, the hunter's cunning were plied where now cities and industries, trade and commerce, buying and selling hold sway.  In those days the moccasined foot awoke no echo in the forest trails.  Primitive weapons, arms, implements, and utensils were the only means of the Indians' food-getting. His livelihood depended upon his own personal prowess, his skill in woodcraft and water lore. And, as this is a story of an elk-bone spear, the reader must first be in sympathy with the fact that this rude instrument, deftly fashioned, was of priceless value to the first Capilano, to whom it had come through three generations of ancestors, all of whom had been experienced hunters and dexterous fishermen.\n\nCapilano himself was without a rival as a spearsman.  He knew the moods of the Fraser River, the habits of its thronging tenants, as no other man has ever known them before or since.  He knew every isle and inlet along the coast, every boulder, the sand-bars, the still pools, the temper of the tides.  He knew the spawning grounds, the secret streams that fed the larger rivers, the outlets of rock-bound lakes, the turns and tricks of swirling rapids. He knew the haunts of bird and beast and fish and fowl, and was master of the arts and artifice that man must use when matching his brain against the eluding wiles of the untamed creatures of the wilderness.\n\nOnce only did his cunning fail him, once only did Nature baffle him with her mysterious fabric of waterways and land lures.  It was when he was led to the mouth of the unknown river, which has evaded discovery through all the centuries, but which--so say the Indians--still sings on its way through some buried channel that leads from the lake to the sea.\n\nHe had been sealing along the shores of what is now known as Point Grey.  His canoe had gradually crept inland, skirting up the coast to the mouth of False Creek.  Here he encountered a very king of seals, a colossal creature that gladdened the hunter's eyes as game worthy of his skill.  For this particular prize he would cast the elk-bone spear.  It had never failed his sire, his grandsire, his great-grandsire. He knew it would not fail him now.  A long, pliable, cedar-fibre rope lay in his canoe.  Many expert fingers had woven and plaited that rope, had beaten and oiled it until it was soft and flexible as a serpent.  This he attached to the spearhead, and with deft, unerring aim cast it at the king seal.  The weapon struck home.  The gigantic creature shuddered and, with a cry like a hurt child, it plunged down into the sea.  With the rapidity and strength of a giant fish it scudded inland with the rising tide, while Capilano paid out the rope its entire length, and, as it stretched taut, felt the canoe leap forward, propelled by the mighty strength of the creature which lashed the waters into whirlpools, as though it was possessed with the power and properties of a whale.\n\nUp the stretch of False Creek the man and monster drove their course, where a century hence great city bridges were to over-arch the waters.  They strove and struggled each for the mastery, neither of them weakened, neither of them faltered--the one dragging, the other driving.  In the end it was to be a matching of brute and human wits, not forces.  As they neared the point where now Main Street bridge flings its shadow across the waters, the brute leaped high into the air, then plunged headlong into the depths.  The impact ripped the rope from Capilano's hands.  It rattled across the gunwale.  He stood staring at the spot where it had disappeared--the brute had been victorious.  At low tide the Indian made search.  No trace of his game, of his precious elk-bone spear, of his cedar-fibre rope, could be found.  With the loss of the latter he firmly believed his luck as a hunter would be gone. So he patrolled the mouth of False Creek for many moons.  His graceful, high-bowed canoe rarely touched other waters, but the seal king had disappeared.  Often he thought long strands of drifting sea grasses were his lost cedar-fibre rope.  With other spears, with other cedar-fibres, with paddle blade and cunning traps he dislodged the weeds from their moorings, but they slipped their slimy lengths through his eager hands: his best spear with its attendant coil was gone.\n\nThe following year he was sealing again off the coast of Point Grey, and one night after sunset he observed the red reflection from the west, which seemed to transfer itself to the eastern skies.  Far into the night dashes of flaming scarlet pulsed far beyond the head of False Creek.  The color rose and fell like a beckoning hand, and, Indian-like, he immediately attached some portentous meaning to the unusual sight.  That it was some omen he never doubted, so he paddled inland, beached his canoe, and took the trail towards the little group of lakes that crowd themselves into the area that lies between the present cities of Vancouver and New Westminster. But long before he reached the shores of Deer Lake he discovered that the beckoning hand was in reality flame.  The little body of water was surrounded by forest fires.  One avenue alone stood open.  It was a group of giant trees that as yet the flames had not reached. As he neared the point he saw a great moving mass of living things leaving the lake and hurrying northward through this one egress. He stood, listening, intently watching with alert eyes; the swirr of myriads of little travelling feet caught his quick ear--the moving mass was an immense colony of beaver. Thousands upon thousands of them.  Scores of baby beavers staggered along, following their mothers; scores of older beavers that had felled trees and built dams through many seasons; a countless army of trekking fur beavers, all under the generalship of a wise old leader, who, as king of the colony, advanced some few yards ahead of his battalions.  Out of the waters through the forest towards the country to the north they journeyed.  Wandering hunters said they saw them cross Burrard Inlet at the Second Narrows, heading inland as they reached the farther shore.  But where that mighty army of royal little Canadians set up their new colony, no man knows.  Not even the astuteness of the first Capilano ever discovered their destination.  Only one thing was certain, Deer Lake knew them no more.\n\nAfter their passing, the Indian retraced their trail to the water's edge.  In the red glare of the encircling fires he saw what he at first thought was some dead and dethroned king beaver on the shore.  A huge carcass lay half in, half out, of the lake.  Approaching it he saw the wasted body of a giant seal.  There could never be two seals of that marvellous size.  His intuition now grasped the meaning of the omen of the beckoning flame that had called him from the far coasts of Point Grey. He stooped above his dead conqueror and found, embedded in its decaying flesh, the elk-bone spear of his forefathers, and trailing away at the water's rim was a long flexible cedar-fibre rope.\n\nAs he extracted this treasured heirloom he felt the \"power,\" that men of magic possess, creep up his sinewy arms.  It entered his heart, his blood, his brain.  For a long time he sat and chanted songs that only great medicine men may sing, and, as the hours drifted by, the heat of the forest fires subsided, the flames diminished into smouldering blackness. At daybreak the forest fire was dead, but its beckoning fingers had served their purpose. The magic elk-bone spear had come back to its own.\n\nUntil the day of his death the first Capilano searched for the unknown river up which the seal travelled from False Creek to Deer Lake, but its channel is a secret that even Indian eyes have not seen.\n\nBut although those of the Squamish tribe tell and believe that the river still sings through its hidden trail that leads from Deer Lake to the sea, its course is as unknown, its channel is as hopelessly lost as the brave little army of beavers that a century ago marshalled their forces and travelled up into the great lone north.\n\nA Royal Mohawk Chief\n\nHow many Canadians are aware that in Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, and only surviving son of Queen Victoria, who has been appointed to represent King George V in Canada, they undoubtedly have what many wish for--one bearing an ancient Canadian title as Governor-General of all the Dominion?  It would be difficult to find a man more Canadian than any one of the fifty chiefs who compose the parliament of the ancient Iroquois nation, that royal race of Redskins that has fought for the British crown against all of the enemies thereof, adhering to the British flag through the wars against both the French and the colonists.\n\nArthur Duke of Connaught is the only living white man who to-day has an undisputed right to the title of \"Chief of the Six Nations Indians\" (known collectively as the Iroquois). He possesses the privilege of sitting in their councils, of casting his vote on all matters relative to the governing of the tribes, the disposal of reservation lands, the appropriation of both the principal and interest of the more than half a million dollars these tribes hold in Government bonds at Ottawa, accumulated from the sales of their lands.  In short, were every drop of blood in his royal veins red, instead of blue, he could not be more fully qualified as an Indian chief than he now is, not even were his title one of the fifty hereditary ones whose illustrious names composed the Iroquois confederacy before the Paleface ever set foot in America.\n\nIt was on the occasion of his first visit to Canada in 1869, when he was little more than a boy, that Prince Arthur received, upon his arrival at Quebec, an address of welcome from his Royal mother's \"Indian Children\" on the Grand River Reserve, in Brant county, Ontario.  In addition to this welcome they had a request to make of him: would he accept the title of Chief and visit their reserve to give them the opportunity of conferring it?\n\nOne of the great secrets of England's success with savage races has been her consideration, her respect, her almost reverence of native customs, ceremonies and potentates. She wishes her own customs and kings to be honored, so she freely accords like honor to her subjects, it matters not whether they be white, black or red.\n\nYoung Arthur was delighted--royal lads are pretty much like all other boys; the unique ceremony would be a break in the endless round of state receptions, banquets and addresses.  So he accepted the Red Indians' compliment, knowing well that it was the loftiest honor those people could confer upon a white man.\n\nIt was the morning of October first when the royal train steamed into the little city of Brantford, where carriages awaited to take the Prince and his suite to the \"Old Mohawk Church,\" in the vicinity of which the ceremony was to take place.  As for the Prince's especial escort, Onwanonsyshon, head chief of the Mohawks, rode on a jet-black pony beside the carriage. The chief was garmented in full native costume --a buckskin suit, beaded moccasins, headband of owl's and eagle's feathers, and ornaments hammered from coin silver that literally covered his coat and leggings.  About his shoulders was flung a scarlet blanket, consisting of the identical broadcloth from which the British army tunics are made; this he \"hunched\" with his shoulders from time to time in true Indian fashion.  As they drove along, the Prince chatted boyishly with his Mohawk escort, and once leaned forward to pat the black pony on its shining neck and speak admiringly of it.  It was a warm autumn day: the roads were dry and dusty, and, after a mile or so, the boy-prince brought from beneath the carriage seat a basket of grapes.  With his handkerchief he flicked the dust from them, handed a bunch to the chief and took one himself.  An odd spectacle to be traversing a country road: an English prince and an Indian chief, riding amicably side-by-side, enjoying a banquet of grapes like two schoolboys.\n\nOn reaching the church, Arthur leapt lightly to the green sward.  For a moment he stood, rigid, gazing before him at his future brother-chiefs.  His escort had given him a faint idea of what he was to see, but he certainly never expected to be completely surrounded by three hundred full-blooded Iroquois braves and warriors, such as now encircled him on every side.  Every Indian was in war paint and feathers, some stripped to the waist, their copper-colored skins brilliant with paints, dyes and \"patterns\"; all carried tomahawks, scalping-knives, and bows and arrows.  Every red throat gave a tremendous war-whoop as he alighted, which was repeated again and again, as for that half moment he stood silent, a slim boyish figure, clad in light grey tweeds--a singular contrast to the stalwarts in gorgeous costumes who crowded about him.  His young face paled to ashy whiteness, then with true British grit he extended his right hand and raised his black \"billy-cock\" hat with his left.  At the same time he took one step forward.  Then the war cries broke forth anew, deafening, savage, terrible cries, as one by one the entire three hundred filed past, the Prince shaking hands with each one, and removing his glove to do so.  This strange reception over, Onwanonsyshon rode up, and, flinging his scarlet blanket on the grass, dismounted, and asked the Prince to stand on it.\n\nThen stepped forward an ancient chief, father of Onwanonsyshon, and Speaker of the Council.  He was old in inherited and personal loyalty to the British crown.  He had fought under Sir Isaac Brock at Queenston Heights in 1812, while yet a mere boy, and upon him was laid the honor of making his Queen's son a chief.  Taking Arthur by the hand this venerable warrior walked slowly to and fro across the blanket, chanting as he went the strange, wild formula of induction.  From time to time he was interrupted by loud expressions of approval and assent from the vast throng of encircling braves, but apart from this no sound was heard but the low, weird monotone of a ritual older than the white man's footprints in North America.\n\nIt is necessary that a chief of each of the three \"clans\" of the Mohawks shall assist in this ceremony.  The veteran chief, who sang the formula, was of the Bear clan.  His son, Onwanonsyshon, was of the Wolf (the clanship descends through the mother's side of the family).  Then one other chief, of the Turtle clan, and in whose veins coursed the blood of the historic Brant, now stepped to the edge of the scarlet blanket.  The chant ended, these two young chiefs received the Prince into the Mohawk tribe, conferring upon him the name of \"Kavakoudge,\" which means \"the sun flying from East to West under the guidance of the Great Spirit.\"\n\nOnwanonsyshon then took from his waist a brilliant deep-red sash, heavily embroidered with beads, porcupine quills and dyed moose hair, placing it over the Prince's left shoulder and knotting it beneath his right arm.  The ceremony was ended.  The Constitution that Hiawatha had founded centuries ago, a Constitution wherein fifty chiefs, no more, no less, should form the parliament of the \"Six Nations,\" had been shattered and broken, because this race of loyal red men desired to do honor to a slender young boy-prince, who now bears the fifty-first title of the Iroquois.\n\nMany white men have received from these same people honorary titles, but none has been bestowed through the ancient ritual, with the imperative members of the three clans assisting, save that borne by Arthur of Connaught.\n\nAfter the ceremony the Prince entered the church to autograph his name in the ancient Bible, which, with a silver Holy Communion service, a bell, two tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments, and a bronze British coat-of-arms, had been presented to the Mohawks by Queen Anne.  He inscribed \"Arthur\" just below the \"Albert Edward,\" which, as Prince of Wales, the late king wrote when he visited Canada in 1860.\n\nWhen he returned to England, Chief Kavakoudge sent his portrait, together with one of Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort, to be placed in the Council House of the \"Six Nations,\" where they decorate the walls today.\n\nAs I write, I glance up to see, in a corner of my room, a draping scarlet blanket, made of British army broadcloth, for the chief who rode the jet-black pony so long ago was the writer's father.  He was not here to wear it when Arthur of Connaught again set foot on Canadian shores.\n\nMany of these facts I have culled from a paper that lies on my desk; it is yellowing with age, and bears the date, \"Toronto, October 2, 1869,\" and on the margin is written in a clear, half-boyish hand, \"Onwanonsyshon, with kind regards from your brother-chief, Arthur.\"", "timestamp": 1635906725, "digest": "3vX4AzL3LWdNkuQ2y00QLrfOIveakLNj6wnI1Y9pdm0", "contributor": "0xb7660e925FDEA7dC47b0A1dD705473A37284A82b"}

Pauline Johnson (Tekahionwake) is the youngest child of a family of four born to the late G. H. M. Johnson (Onwanonsyshon), Head Chief of the Six Nations Indians, and his wife Emily S. Howells.  The latter was of English parentage, her birthplace being Bristol, but the land of her adoption Canada.\n\nChief Johnson was of the renowned Mohawk tribe, being a scion of one of the fifty noble families which composed the historical confederation founded by Hiawatha upwards of four hundred years ago, and known at that period as the Brotherhood of the Five Nations, but which was afterwards named the Iroquois by the early French missionaries and explorers. For their loyalty to the British Crown they were granted the magnificent lands bordering the Grand River, in the County of Brant, Ontario, on which the tribes still live.\n\nIt was upon this Reserve, on her father's estate, \"Chiefswood,\" that Pauline Johnson was born.  The loyalty of her ancestors breathes in her prose, as well as in her poetic writings.\n\nHer education was neither extensive nor elaborate. It embraced neither high school nor college. A nursery governess for two years at home, three years at an Indian day school half a mile from her home, and two years in the Central School of the city of Brantford, was the extent of her educational training.  But, besides this, she acquired a wide general knowledge, having been through childhood and early girlhood a great reader, especially of poetry.  Before she was twelve years old she had read Scott, Longfellow, Byron, Shakespeare, and such books as Addison's \"Spectator,\" Foster's Essays and Owen Meredith's writings.\n\nThe first periodicals to accept her poems and place them before the public were \"Gems of Poetry,\" a small magazine published in New York, and \"The Week,\" established by the late Prof. Goldwin Smith, of Toronto, the New York \"Independent\" and Toronto \"Saturday Night.\"  Since then she has contributed to most of the high-grade magazines, both on this continent and England.\n\nHer writings having brought her into notice, the next step in Miss Johnson's career was her appearance on the public platform as a reciter of her own poems.  For this she had natural talent, and in the exercise of it she soon developed a marked ability, joined with a personal magnetism, that was destined to make her a favorite with audiences from the Atlantic to the Pacific.  Her friend, Mr. Frank Yeigh, of Toronto, provided for a series of recitals having that scope, with the object of enabling her to go to England to arrange for the publication of her poems.  Within two years this aim was accomplished, her book of poems, \"The White Wampum,\" being published by John Lane, of the Bodley Head. She took with her numerous letters of introduction, including one from the Governor-General, the Earl of Aberdeen, and she soon gained both social and literary standing.  Her book was received with much favor, both by reviewers and the public. After giving many recitals in fashionable drawing-rooms, she returned to Canada, and made her first tour to the Pacific Coast, giving recitals at all the cities and towns en route.  Since then she has crossed the Rocky Mountains no fewer than nineteen times.\n\nMiss Johnson's pen had not been idle, and in 1903 the George Morang Co., of Toronto, published her second book of poems, entitled \"Canadian Born,\" which was also well received.\n\nAfter a number of recitals, which included Newfoundland and the Maritime Provinces, she went to England again in 1906 and made her first appearance in Steinway Hall, under the distinguished patronage of Lord and Lady Strathcona.  In the following year she again visited London, returning by way of the United States, where she gave many recitals.  After another tour of Canada she decided to give up public work, to make Vancouver, B. C., her home, and to devote herself to literary work.\n\nOnly a woman of remarkable powers of endurance could have borne up under the hardships necessarily encountered in travelling through North-western Canada in pioneer days as Miss Johnson did; and shortly after settling down in Vancouver the exposure and hardship she had endured began to tell on her, and her health completely broke down. For almost a year she has been an invalid, and as she is unable to attend to the business herself, a trust has been formed by some of the leading citizens of her adopted city for the purpose of collecting and publishing for her benefit her later works.  Among these are the beautiful Indian Legends contained in this volume, which she has been at great pains to collect, and a series of boys' stories, which have been exceedingly well received by magazine readers.\n\nDuring the sixteen years Miss Johnson was travelling, she had many varied and interesting experiences.  She travelled the old Battleford trail before the railroad went through, and across the Boundary country in British Columbia in the romantic days of the early pioneers.  Once she took an eight hundred and fifty mile drive up the Cariboo trail to the gold fields.  She has always been an ardent canoeist, and has run many strange rivers, crossed many a lonely lake, and camped in many an unfrequented place.  These venturesome trips she made more from her inherent love of Nature and adventure than from any necessity of her profession.\n\nContents\n\n```\n                                       Page Preface  .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .       v Author's Foreword  .   .   .   .   .   .   .   vii Biographical Notice  .   .   .   .   .   .      ix The Two Sisters    .   .   .   .   .   .   .     1 The Siwash Rock  .   .   .   .   .   .   .       7 The Recluse    .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .    13 The Lost Salmon Run  .   .   .   .   .   .      21 The Deep Waters    .   .   .   .   .   .   .    27 The Sea-Serpent  .   .   .   .   .   .   .      33 The Lost Island    .   .   .   .   .   .   .    39 Point Grey   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .      43 The Tulameen Trail .   .   .   .   .   .   .    47 The Grey Archway .   .   .   .   .   .   .      53 Deadman's Island   .   .   .   .   .   .   .    61 A Squamish Legend of Napoleon    .   .   .      67 The Lure in Stanley Park   .   .   .   .   .    73 Deer Lake    .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .      79 A Royal Mohawk Chief   .   .   .   .   .   .    85\n```\n\nThe Two Sisters ----- THE LIONS\n\nYou can see them as you look towards the north and the west, where the dream hills swim into the sky amid their ever-drifting clouds of pearl and grey.

{"id": "MWluVFfvydDMwBIy5AweaciejIz1pZlw1mZdIgUlBW0", "title": "CPython Internals 笔记 ── 编译 Python", "body": "Aug 24, 202112 min. read\n\n现在你已经下载了 CPython 开发环境并对其进行了配置，你可以将 CPython 源代码编译成一个可执行的解释器。\n\n与 Python 文件不同，C 源代码每次更改时都必须重新编译。\n\n在前一章中，我们已经设置开发环境，并设置了运行“Build”阶段的选项，该选项将重新编译 CPython。 在构建步骤工作之前，你需要一个 C 编译器和一些构建工具。 使用的工具取决于你使用的操作系统。\n\n> 如果你担心这些步骤中的任何一个会干扰您现有的 CPython 安装，请不要担心。CPython 源目录的行为就像一个虚拟环境。\n>\n> 对于编译 CPython、修改源代码和标准库，这些都保留在源目录的沙箱中。\n>\n> 如果要安装自定义版本，本章也将介绍此步骤。\n\n## 在 macOS 系统上编译 CPython\n\n在 macOS 上编译 CPython 需要一些额外的应用程序和库。你首先需要基本的 C 编译器工具包。 “Command Line Development Tools” 是一个可以在 macOS 中通过 App Store 更新的应用程序。 你需要在终端上执行初始安装。\n\n在终端中，通过运行以下命令安装 C 编译器和工具包：\n\n    $ xcode-select --install\n\n该命令会弹出一个提示，提示下载并安装一组工具，包括 Git、Make 和 GNU C 编译器。\n\n你还需要一份 [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) 的工作副本，用于从 [PyPi.org](http://pypi.org/) 网站获取包。 如果你以后计划使用此构建版本来安装其他软件包，则需要进行 SSL 验证。\n\n在 macOS 上安装 OpenSSL 的最简单方法是使用 [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)。\n\n可以使用一下命令安装 Homebrew：\n\n    $ /usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL \\\n     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\n一旦安装完成，你就可以使用 `brew install` 命令来安装所需的工具。\n\n    $ brew install openssl xz zlib gdbm sqlite\n\n现在你已经安装了依赖项，你可以运行 `configure` 脚本。 Homebrew 有一个命令 `brew --prefix [package]` ，它将给出安装包的目录。 你将通过编译 Homebrew 使用的位置来启用对 SSL 的支持。\n\n标志 `--with-pydebug` 启用调试挂钩。如果你打算出于开发或测试目的进行调试，请添加此项。\n\n配置阶段只需要运行一次，同时指定 `zlib` 包的位置：\n\n    $ CPPFLAGS=\"-I$(brew --prefix zlib)/include\" \\\n     LDFLAGS=\"-L$(brew --prefix zlib)/lib -L$(brew --prefix bzip2)/lib\" \\\n     ./configure --with-openssl=$(brew --prefix openssl) --with-pydebug\n\n运行 `configure` 将在存储库的根目录中生成一个 `Makefile`，你可以使用它来自动化构建过程。\n\n你现在可以通过运行一下命令来构建 CPython 二进制文件：\n\n    $ make -j2 -s\n\n在构建过程中，你可能会收到一些错误。在构建摘要中，`make` 会通知你并非所有包都已构建。 例如，`ossaudiodev`、`spwd` 和 `_tkinter` 将无法使用这组指令进行构建。 如果你不打算针对这些软件包进行开发，那也没关系。 如果是，请查看[官方开发指南](https://devguide.python.org/)网站以获取更多信息。\n\n构建将需要几分钟并生成一个名为 `python.exe` 的二进制文件。每次对源代码进行更改时， 你都会需要使用相同的标志重新运行 `make`。 `python.exe` 二进制文件是 CPython 的调试二进制文件。 执行 `python.exe` 以查看有效的 REPL：\n\n    $ ./python.exe\n    Python 3.9.0b1 (tags/v3.9.0b1:97fe9cf, May 19 2020, 10:00:00)\n    [Clang 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4)] on darwin\n    Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n    >>>\n\n> 是的，没错，macOS 版本的文件扩展名为 `.exe`。 这个扩展*不是*因为它是 Windows 二进制文件！ 因为 macOS 有一个不区分大小写的文件系统，并且在使用二进制文件时， 开发人员不希望人们不小心引用 `Python/` 目录，因此附加了 `.exe` 以避免歧义。 如果你稍后运行 `make install` 或 `make altinstall`， 它将在将文件安装到你的系统之前将文件重命名回 python。\n\n## 配置文件引导优化\n\nmacOS、Linux 和 Windows 构建过程具有“PGO”或“Profile Guided Optimization”标志。 PGO 不是 Python 团队创建的东西，而是许多编译器的特性，包括 CPython 使用的编译器。\n\nPGO 的工作方式是进行初始编译，然后通过运行一系列测试来分析应用程序。 然后分析创建的配置文件，编译器将对二进制文件进行更改以提高性能。\n\n对于 CPython，分析阶段运行 `python -m test --pgo`， 它执行在 `Lib/test/libregrtest/pgo.py` 中指定的回归测试。 这些测试是专门选择的，因为它们使用常用的 C 扩展模块或类型。\n\n> PGO 过程非常耗时，因此在整本书中，我将其排除在推荐步骤列表之外，以缩短编译时间。 如果要将自定义编译版本的 CPython 分发到生产环境中， 则应在 Linux 和 macOS 中使用 `--with-pgo` 标志运行 `./configure`， 并在 Windows 上使用 `--pgo` 标志运行 `build.bat`。\n\n由于优化特定于执行配置文件的平台和架构，因此无法在操作系统或 CPU 架构之间共享 PGO 配置文件。 [python.org](http://python.org/) 上的 CPython 发行版已经通过 PGO，所以如果你在编译的二进制文件上运行基准测试， 它会比从 [python.org](http://python.org/) 下载的要慢。\n\nWindows、macOS 和 Linux 配置文件引导的优化包括以下检查和改进：\n\n*   **函数内联** ── 如果函数被另一个函数定期调用，那么它将被“内联”以减少堆栈大小。\n*   **虚拟调用推测和内联** ── 如果一个虚拟函数调用频繁地针对某个函数， PGO 可以插入一个有条件执行的对该函数的直接调用。然后可以内联直接调用。\n*   **寄存器分配优化** ── 基于配置文件数据结果，PGO 将优化寄存器分配。\n*   **基本块优化** ── 基本块优化允许在给定帧内临时执行的共同执行的基本块放置在同一组页面（局部性）中。 它最大限度地减少了使用的页面数量，从而最大限度地减少了内存开销。\n*   **热点优化** ── 程序花费最多执行时间的函数可以优化速度。\n*   **函数布局优化** ── 在分析调用图之后，倾向于沿着相同执行路径的函数被移动到编译应用程序的同一部分。\n*   **条件分支优化** - PGO 可以查看决策分支，如 `if..else if` 或 `switch` 语句，并找出最常用的路径。 例如，如果 `switch` 语句中有 10 个 `case`，其中一个使用了 95% 的时间，那么它会被移到顶部，以便在代码路径中立即执行。\n*   **死点分离** ── 在 PGO 期间未调用的代码被移动到应用程序的单独部分。\n\n## 结论\n\n在本章中，你已经了解了如何将 CPython 源代码编译成可工作的解释器。 在探索和改编源代码时，你可以在整本书中使用这些知识。\n\n在使用 CPython 时，你可能需要重复编译步骤数十次甚至数百次。 如果你可以调整你的开发环境来创建重新编译的快捷方式，最好现在就这样做，这样可以节省大量时间。\n\n> GitHub repo: [qiwihui/blog](https://github.com/qiwihui/blog)\n>\n> Follow me: [@qiwihui](https://github.com/qiwihui)\n>\n> Site: [QIWIHUI](https://qiwihui.com/)\n\n###\n", "timestamp": 1635906796, "digest": "Jpuhfun1pgncoM3a5Pw7C-ry0EnL-DWGzj_uoj5y7Lw", "contributor": "0x169841AA3024cfa570024Eb7Dd6Bf5f774092088"}
{"id": "NH5JyJw3DyZn1_5yA4GhtJ04SObUTndEi-E0nOHFMFM", "title": "Journeying toward the upper course of the Capilano River, about a mile citywards from the damn, ", "body": ", you will pass a disused logger's shack.  Leave the trail at this point and strike through the undergrowth for a few hundred yards and you will be on the rocky borders of that purest, most restless river in all Canada.  The stream is haunted with tradition, teeming with a score of romances that vie with its grandeur and loveliness, and of which its waters are perpetually whispering.  But I learned this legend from one whose voice was as dulcet as the swirling rapids; but, unlike them, that voice is hushed today, while the river still sings on --sings on.\n\nIt was singing in very melodious tones through the long August afternoon two summers ago, while we, the chief, his happy-hearted wife and bright, young daughter, all lounged amongst the boulders and watched the lazy clouds drift from peak to peak far above us.  It was one of his inspired days; legends crowded to his lips as a whistle teases the mouth of a happy boy, his heart was brimming with tales of the bygones, his eyes were dark with dreams and that strange mournfulness that always haunted them when he spoke of long-ago romances.  There was not a tree, a boulder, a dash of rapid upon which his glance fell that he had not some ancient superstition to link with it.  Then abruptly, in the very midst of his verbal reveries, he turned and asked me if I were superstitious.  Of course I replied that I was.\n\n\"Do you think some happenings will bring trouble later on--will foretell evil?\" he asked.\n\nI made some evasive answer, which, however, seemed to satisfy him, for he plunged into the strange tale of the recluse of the canyon with more vigor than dreaminess; but first he asked me the question:\n\n\"What do your own tribes, those east of the great mountains think of twin children?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"That is enough,\" he said before I could reply.  \"I see, your people do not like them.\"\n\n\"Twin children are almost unknown with us,\" I hastened.  \"They are rare, very rare, but it is true we do not welcome them.\"\n\n\"Why?\" he asked abruptly.\n\nI was a little uncertain about telling him. If I said the wrong thing, the coming tale might die on his lips before it was born to speech, but we understood each other so well that I finally ventured the truth:\n\n\"We Iroquois say that twin children are as rabbits,\" I explained.  \"The nation always nicknames the parents.  'Tow-wan-da-na-ga.' That is the Mohawk for rabbit.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" he asked curiously.\n\n\"That is all.  Is it not enough to render twin children unwelcome?\" I questioned.\n\nHe thought awhile, then with evident desire to learn how all races regarded this occurrence, he said, \"You have been much among the Palefaces, what do they say of twins?\"\n\n\"Oh! the Palefaces like them.  They are --they are--oh! well, they say they are very proud of having twins,\" I stammered. Once again I was hardly sure of my ground. He looked most incredulous, and I was led to enquire what his own people of the Squamish thought of this discussed problem.\n\n\"It is no pride to us,\" he said, decidedly; \"nor yet is it disgrace of rabbits, but it is a fearsome thing--a sign of coming evil to the father, and, worse than that, of coming disaster to the tribe.\"\n\nThen I knew he held in his heart some strange incident that gave substance to the superstition.  \"Won't you tell it to me?\" I begged.\n\nHe leaned a little backward against a giant boulder, clasping his thin, brown hands about his knees; his eyes roved up the galloping river, then swept down the singing waters to where they crowded past the sudden bend, and during the entire recital of the strange legend his eyes never left that spot where the stream disappeared in its hurrying journey to the sea.  Without preamble he began:\n\n\"It was a grey morning when they told him of this disaster that had befallen him.  He was a great chief, and he ruled many tribes on the North Pacific Coast; but what was his greatness now?  His young wife had borne him twins, and was sobbing out her anguish in the little fir-bark lodge near the tidewater.\n\n\"Beyond the doorway gathered many old men and women--old in years, old in wisdom, old in the lore and learning of their nations. Some of them wept, some chanted solemnly the dirge of their lost hopes and happiness, which would never return because of this calamity; others discussed in hushed voices this awesome thing, and for hours their grave council was broken only by the infant cries of the two boy-babies in the bark lodge, the hopeless sobs of the young mother, the agonized moans of the stricken chief--their father.\n\n\"'Something dire will happen to the tribe,' said the old men in council.\n\n\"'Something dire will happen to him, my husband,' wept the young mother.\n\n\"'Something dire will happen to us all,' echoed the unhappy father.\n\n\"Then an ancient medicine man arose, lifting his arms, outstretching his palms to hush the lamenting throng.  His voice shook with the weight of many winters, but his eyes were yet keen and mirrored the clear thought and brain behind them, as the still trout pools in the Capilano mirror the mountain tops. His words were masterful, his gestures commanding, his shoulders erect and kindly.  His was a personality and an inspiration that no one dared dispute, and his judgment was accepted as the words fell slowly, like a doom.\n\n\"'It is the olden law of the Squamish that lest evil befall the tribe the sire of twin children must go afar and alone into the mountain fastnesses, there by his isolation and his loneliness to prove himself stronger than the threatened evil, and thus to beat back the shadow that would otherwise follow him and all his people.  I, therefore, name for him the length of days that he must spend alone fighting his invisible enemy.  He will know by some great sign in Nature the hour that the evil is conquered, the hour that his race is saved.  He must leave before this sun sets, taking with him only his strongest bow, his fleetest arrows, and going up into the mountain wilderness remain there ten days--alone, alone.'\n\n\"The masterful voice ceased, the tribe wailed their assent, the father arose speechless, his drawn face revealing great agony over this seemingly brief banishment.  He took leave of his sobbing wife, of the two tiny souls that were his sons, grasped his favorite bow and arrows, and faced the forest like a warrior.  But at the end of the ten days he did not return, nor yet ten weeks, nor yet ten months.\n\n\"'He is dead,' wept the mother into the baby ears of her two boys.  'He could not battle against the evil that threatened; it was stronger than he--he so strong, so proud, so brave.'\n\n\"'He is dead,' echoed the tribesmen and the tribeswomen.  'Our strong, brave chief, he is dead.'  So they mourned the long year through, but their chants and their tears but renewed their grief; he did not return to them.\n\n\"Meanwhile, far up the Capilano the banished chief had built his solitary home; for who can tell what fatal trick of sound, what current of air, what faltering note in the voice of the Medicine Man had deceived his alert Indian ears?  But some unhappy fate had led him to understand that his solitude must be of ten years' duration, not ten days, and he had accepted the mandate with the heroism of a stoic.  For if he had refused to do so his belief was that although the threatened disaster would be spared him, the evil would fall upon his tribe.  This was one more added to the long list of self-forgetting souls whose creed has been, 'It is fitting that one should suffer for the people.'  It was the world-old heroism of vicarious sacrifice.\n\n\"With his hunting-knife the banished Squamish chief stripped the bark from the firs and cedars, building for himself a lodge beside the Capilano River, where leaping trout and salmon could be speared by arrow-heads fastened to deftly shaped, long handles.  All through the salmon run he smoked and dried the fish with the care of a housewife.  The mountain sheep and goats, and even huge black and cinnamon bears, fell before his unerring arrows; the fleet-footed deer never returned to their haunts from their evening drinking at the edge of the stream--their wild hearts, their agile bodies were stilled when he took aim.  Smoked hams and saddles hung in rows from the cross poles of his bark lodge, and the magnificent pelts of animals carpeted his floors, padded his couch and clothed his body.  He tanned the soft doe hides, making leggings, moccasins and shirts, stitching them together with deer sinew as he had seen his mother do in the long-ago.  He gathered the juicy salmonberries, their acid flavor being a gratifying change from meat and fish.  Month by month and year by year he sat beside his lonely camp-fire, waiting for his long term of solitude to end.  One comfort alone was his-- he was enduring the disaster, fighting the evil, that his tribe might go unscathed, that his people be saved from calamity.  Slowly, laboriously the tenth year dawned; day by day it dragged its long weeks across his waiting heart, for Nature had not yet given the sign that his long probation was over.\n\n\"Then one hot summer day the Thunder Bird came crashing through the mountains about him.  Up from the arms of the Pacific rolled the storm cloud, and the Thunder Bird, with its eyes of flashing light, beat its huge vibrating wings on crag and canyon.\n\n\"Upstream, a tall shaft of granite rears its needle-like length.  It is named 'Thunder Rock,' and wise men of the Paleface people say it is rich in ore--copper, silver and gold. At the base of this shaft the Squamish chief crouched when the storm cloud broke and bellowed through the ranges, and on its summit the Thunder Bird perched, its gigantic wings threshing the air into booming sounds, into splitting terrors, like the crash of a giant cedar hurtling down the mountain side.\n\n\"But when the beating of those black pinions ceased and the echo of their thunder waves died down the depths of the canyon, the Squamish chief arose as a new man.  The shadow on his soul had lifted, the fears of evil were cowed and conquered.  In his brain, his blood, his veins, his sinews, he felt that the poison of melancholy dwelt no more.  He had redeemed his fault of fathering twin children; he had fulfilled the demands of the law of his tribe.\n\n\"As he heard the last beat of the Thunder Bird's wings dying slowly, slowly, faintly, faintly, among the crags, he knew that the bird, too, was dying, for its soul was leaving its monster black body, and presently that soul appeared in the sky.  He could see it arching overhead, before it took its long journey to the Happy Hunting Grounds, for the soul of the Thunder Bird was a radiant half-circle of glorious color spanning from peak to peak. He lifted his head then, for he knew it was the sign the ancient Medicine Man had told him to wait for--the sign that his long banishment was ended.\n\n\"And all these years, down in the tidewater country, the little brown-faced twins were asking childwise, 'Where is our father?  Why have we no father like other boys?'  To be met only with the oft-repeated reply, 'Your father is no more.  Your father, the great chief, is dead.'\n\n\"But some strange filial intuition told the boys that their sire would some day return. Often they voiced this feeling to their mother, but she would only weep and say that not even the witchcraft of the great Medicine Man could bring him to them.  But when they were ten years old the two children came to their mother, hand within hand.  They were armed with their little hunting-knives, their salmon spears, their tiny bows and arrows.\n\n\"'We go to find our father,' they said.\n\n\"'Oh! useless quest,' wailed the mother.\n\n\"'Oh! useless quest,' echoed the tribes-people.\n\n\"But the great Medicine Man said, 'The heart of a child has invisible eyes, perhaps the child-eyes see him.  The heart of a child has invisible ears, perhaps the child-ears hear him call.  Let them go.'  So the little children went forth into the forest; their young feet flew as though shod with wings, their young hearts pointed to the north as does the white man's compass.  Day after day they journeyed up-stream, until rounding a sudden bend they beheld a bark lodge with a thin blue curl of smoke drifting from its roof.\n\n\"'It is our father's lodge,' they told each other, for their childish hearts were unerring in response to the call of kinship.  Hand-in-hand they approached, and entering the lodge, said the one word, 'Come.'\n\n\"The great Squamish chief outstretched his arms towards them, then towards the laughing river, then towards the mountains.\n\n\"'Welcome, my sons!' he said.  'And good-bye, my mountains, my brothers, my crags and my canyons!'  And with a child clinging to each hand he faced once more the country of the tidewater.\"\n\n\n*****\n\nThe legend was ended.", "timestamp": 1635906653, "digest": "YgirqIHyzdDfuIlM8DiL1wYH3TncefY5l2z3u5GKrjU", "contributor": "0xdAD957361768B35f30365E92A8C13e24b91Df004"}
{"id": "UFPEGtKDgF-U7OuIad3vGws4UeFXaRKn9DLCSmPza0w", "title": "For a long time he sat in silence.  He had removed his gaze from the bend in the river, ", "body": "around which the two children had come and where the eyes of the recluse had first rested on them after ten years of solitude.\n\nThe chief spoke again, \"It was here, on this spot we are sitting, that he built his lodge: here he dwelt those ten years alone, alone.\"\n\nI nodded silently.  The legend was too beautiful to mar with comments, and as the twilight fell, we threaded our way through the underbrush, past the disused logger's camp and into the trail that leads citywards.\n\nThe Lost Salmon Run\n\nGreat had been the \"run,\" and the sockeye season was almost over.  For that reason I wondered many times why my old friend, the klootchman, had failed to make one of the fishing fleet.  She was an indefatigable workwoman, rivalling her husband as an expert catcher, and all the year through she talked of little else but the coming run.  But this especial season she had not appeared amongst her fellow-kind.  The fleet and the canneries knew nothing of her, and when I enquired of her tribes-people they would reply without explanation, \"She not here this year.\"\n\nBut one russet September afternoon I found her.  I had idled down the trail from the swans' basin in Stanley Park to the rim that skirts the Narrows, and I saw her graceful, high-bowed canoe heading for the beach that is the favorite landing place of the \"tillicums\" from the Mission.  Her canoe looked like a dream-craft, for the water was very still and everywhere a blue film hung like a fragrant veil, for the peat on Lulu Island had been smoldering for days and its pungent odors and blue-grey haze made a dream-world of sea and shore and sky.\n\nI hurried upshore, hailing her in the Chinook, and as she caught my voice she lifted her paddle directly above her head in the Indian signal of greeting.\n\nAs she beached, I greeted her with extended eager hands to assist her ashore, for the klootchman is getting to be an old woman; albeit she paddles against tidewater like a boy in his teens.\n\n\"No,\" she said, as I begged her to come ashore.  \"I not wait--me.  I just come to fetch Maarda; she been city; she come soon --now.\"  But she left her \"working\" attitude and curled like a schoolgirl in the bow of the canoe, her elbows resting on her paddle which she had flung across the gunwales.\n\n\"I have missed you, klootchman; you have not been to see me for three moons, and you have not fished or been at the canneries,\" I remarked.\n\n\"No,\" she said.  \"I stay home this year.\" Then leaning towards me with grave import in her manner, her eyes, her voice, she added, \"I have a grandchild, born first week July, so --I stay.\"\n\nSo this explained her absence.  I, of course, offered congratulations and enquired all about the great event, for this was her first grandchild, and the little person was of importance.\n\n\"And are you going to make a fisherman of him?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, no, not boy-child, it is girl-child,\" she answered with some indescribable trick of expression that led me to know she preferred it so.\n\n\"You are pleased it is a girl?\" I questioned in surprise.\n\n\"Very pleased,\" she replied emphatically. \"Very good luck to have girl for first grandchild. Own tribe not like yours; we want girl children first; we not always wish boy-child born just for fight.  Your people, they care only for war-path; our tribe more peaceful. Very good sign first grandchild to be girl.  I tell you why: girl-child maybe some time mother herself; very grand thing to be mother.\"\n\nI felt I had caught the secret of her meaning.  She was rejoicing that this little one should some time become one of the mothers of her race.  We chatted over it a little longer and she gave me several playful \"digs\" about my own tribe thinking so much less of motherhood than hers, and so much more of battle and bloodshed.  Then we drifted into talk of the sockeye run and of the hyiu chickimin the Indians would get.\n\n\"Yes, hyiu chickimin,\" she repeated with a sigh of satisfaction.  \"Always; and hyiu muck-a-muck when big salmon run.  No more ever come that bad year when not any fish.\"\n\n\"When was that?\" I asked.\n\n\"Before you born, or I, or\"--pointing across the park to the distant city of Vancouver, that breathed its wealth and beauty across the September afternoon--\"before that place born, before white man came here-- oh! long before.\"\n\nDear old klootchman!  I knew by the dusk in her eyes that she was back in her Land of Legends, and that soon I would be the richer in my hoard of Indian lore.  She sat, still leaning on her paddle; her eyes, half-closed, rested on the distant outline of the blurred heights across the Inlet.  I shall not further attempt her broken English, for this is but the shadow of her story, and without her unique personality the legend is as a flower that lacks both color and fragrance.  She called it \"The Lost Salmon Run.\"\n\n\"The wife of the Great Tyee was but a wisp of a girl, but all the world was young in those days; even the Fraser River was young and small, not the mighty water it is now; but the pink salmon crowded its throat just as they do now, and the tillicums caught and salted and smoked the fish just as they have done this year, just as they will always do. But it was yet winter, and the rains were slanting and the fogs drifting, when the wife of the Great Tyee stood before him and said:\n\n\"'Before the salmon run I shall give to you a great gift.  Will you honor me most if it is the gift of a boy-child or a girl-child?'  The Great Tyee loved the woman.  He was stern with his people, hard with his tribe; he ruled his council fires with a will of stone.  His medicine men said he had no human heart in his body; his warriors said he had no human blood in his veins.  But he clasped this woman's hands, and his eyes, his lips, his voice, were gentle as her own, as he replied:\n\n\"'Give to me a girl-child--a little girl-child --that she may grow to be like you, and, in her turn, give to her husband children.'\n\n\"But when the tribes-people heard of his choice they arose in great anger.  They surrounded him in a deep indignant circle.  'You are a slave to the woman,' they declared, 'and now you desire to make yourself a slave to a woman-baby.  We want an heir--a man-child to be our Great Tyee in years to come.  When you are old and weary of tribal affairs, when you sit wrapped in your blanket in the hot summer sunshine, because your blood is old and thin, what can a girl-child do to help either you or us?  Who, then, will be our Great Tyee?'\n\n\"He stood in the centre of the menacing circle, his arm folded, his chin raised, his eyes hard as flint.  His voice, cold as stone, replied:\n\n\"'Perhaps she will give you such a manchild, and, if so, the child is yours; he will belong to you, not to me; he will become the possession of the people.  But if the child is a girl she will belong to me--she will be mine. You cannot take her from me as you took me from my mother's side and forced me to forget my aged father in my service to my tribe; she will belong to me, will be the mother of my grandchildren, and her husband will be my son.'\n\n\"'You do not care for the good of your tribe.  You care only for your own wishes and desires,' they rebelled.  'Suppose the salmon run is small, we will have no food; suppose there is no man-child, we will have no Great Tyee to show us how to get food from other tribes, and we shall starve.'\n\n\"'Your hearts are black and bloodless,' thundered the Great Tyee, turning upon them fiercely, 'and your eyes are blinded.  Do you wish the tribe to forget how great is the importance of a child that will some day be a mother herself, and give to your children and grandchildren a Great Tyee?  Are the people to live, to thrive, to increase, to become more powerful with no mother-women to bear future sons and daughters?  Your minds are dead, your brains are chilled.  Still, even in your ignorance, you are my people: you and your wishes must be considered.  I call together the great medicine men, the men of witchcraft, the men of magic.  They shall decide the laws which will follow the bearing of either boy or girl-child.  What say you, oh! mighty men?'\n\n\"Messengers were then sent up and down the coast, sent far up the Fraser River, and to the valley lands inland for many leagues, gathering as they journeyed all the men of magic that could be found.  Never were so many medicine men in council before.  They built fires and danced and chanted for many days.  They spoke with the gods of the mountains, with the gods of the sea, then 'the power' of decision came to them.  They were inspired with a choice to lay before the tribespeople, and the most ancient medicine man in all the coast region arose and spoke their resolution:\n\n\"'The people of the tribe cannot be allowed to have all things.  They want a boy-child and they want a great salmon run also.  They cannot have both.  The Sagalie Tyee has revealed to us, the great men of magic, that both these things will make the people arrogant and selfish.  They must choose between the two.'\n\n\"'Choose, oh! you ignorant tribes-people,' commanded the Great Tyee.  'The wise men of our coast have said that the girl-child who will some day bear children of her own will also bring abundance of salmon at her birth; but the boy-child brings to you but himself.'\n\n\"'Let the salmon go,'\" shouted the people, 'but give us a future Great Tyee.  Give us the boy-child.'\n\n\"And when the child was born it was a boy.\n\n\"'Evil will fall upon you,' wailed the Great Tyee.  'You have despised a mother-woman. You will suffer evil and starvation and hunger and poverty, oh! foolish tribes-people.  Did you not know how great a girl-child is?'\n\n\"That spring, people from a score of tribes came up to the Fraser for the salmon run. They came great distances--from the mountains, the lakes, the far-off dry lands, but not one fish entered the vast rivers of the Pacific Coast.  The people had made their choice. They had forgotten the honor that a mother-child would have brought them.  They were bereft of their food.  They were stricken with poverty.  Through the long winter that followed they endured hunger and starvation.  Since then our tribe has always welcomed girl-children--we want no more lost runs.\"\n\nThe klootchman lifted her arms from her paddle as she concluded; her eyes left the irregular outline of the violet mountains.  She had come back to this year of grace--her Legend Land had vanished.\n\n\"So,\" she added, \"you see now, maybe, why I glad my grandchild is girl; it means big salmon run next year.\"\n\n\"It is a beautiful story, klootchman,\" I said, \"and I feel a cruel delight that your men of magic punished the people for their ill-choice.\"\n\n\"That because you girl-child yourself,\" she laughed.\n\nThere was the slightest whisper of a step behind me.  I turned to find Maarda almost at my elbow.  The rising tide was unbeaching the canoe, and as Maarda stepped in and the klootchman slipped astern it drifted afloat.\n\n\"Kla-how-ya,\" nodded the klootchman as she dipped her paddle-blade in exquisite silence.\n\n\"Kla-how-ya,\" smiled Maarda.\n\n\"Kla-how-ya, tillicums,\" I replied, and watched for many moments as they slipped away into the blurred distance, until the canoe merged into the violet and grey of the farther shore.\n\nThe Deep Waters\n\nFar over your left shoulder as your boat leaves the Narrows to thread the beautiful waterways that lead to Vancouver Island, you will see the summit of Mount Baker robed in its everlasting whiteness and always reflecting some wonderful glory from the rising sun, the golden noontide, or the violet and amber sunset.  This is the Mount Ararat of the Pacific Coast peoples; for those readers who are familiar with the ways and beliefs and faiths of primitive races will agree that it is difficult to discover anywhere in the world a race that has not some story of the Deluge, which they have chronicled and localized to fit the understanding and the conditions of the nation that composes their own immediate world.\n\nAmongst the red nations of America I doubt if any two tribes have the same ideas regarding the Flood.  Some of the traditions concerning this vast whim of Nature are grotesque in the extreme; some are impressive; some even profound; but of all the stories of the Deluge that I have been able to collect I know of not a single one that can even begin to equal in beauty of conception, let alone rival in possible reality and truth, the Squamish legend of \"The Deep Waters.\"\n\nI here quote the legend of \"mine own people,\" the Iroquois tribes of Ontario, regarding the Deluge.  I do this to paint the color of contrast in richer shades, for I am bound to submit that we who pride ourselves on ancient intellectuality have but a childish tale of the Flood when compared with the jealously preserved annals of the Squamish, which savour more of history than tradition. With \"mine own people,\" animals always play a much more important part and are endowed with a finer intelligence than humans.  I do not find amid my notes a single tradition of the Iroquois wherein animals do not figure, and our story of the Deluge rests entirely with the intelligence of sea-going and river-going creatures.  With us, animals in olden times were greater than man; but it is not so with the Coast Indians, except in rare instances.\n\nWhen a Coast Indian consents to tell you a legend he will, without variation, begin it with, \"It was before the white people came.\"\n\nThe natural thing for you then to ask is, \"But who were here then?\"\n\nHe will reply, \"Indians, and just the trees, and animals, and fishes, and a few birds.\"\n\nSo you are prepared to accept the animal world as intelligent co-habitants of the Pacific slope, but he will not lead you to think he regards them as equals, much less superiors. But to revert to \"mine own people\": they hold the intelligence of wild animals far above that of man, for perhaps the one reason that when an animal is sick it effects its own cure; it knows what grasses and herbs to eat, what to avoid, while the sick human calls the medicine man, whose wisdom is not only the result of years of study, but also heredity; consequently any great natural event, such as the Deluge, has much to do with the wisdom of the creatures of the forests and the rivers.\n\nIroquois tradition tells us that once this earth was entirely submerged in water, and during this period for many days a busy little muskrat swam about vainly looking for a foothold of earth wherein to build his house.  In his search he encountered a turtle leisurely swimming about, so they had speech together, and the muskrat complained of weariness; he could find no foothold; he was tired of incessant swimming, and longed for land such as his ancestors enjoyed.  The turtle suggested that the muskrat should dive and endeavor to find earth at the bottom of the sea.  Acting on this advice the muskrat plunged down, then arose with his two little forepaws grasping some earth he had found beneath the waters.\n\n\"Place it on my shell and dive again for more,\" directed the turtle.  The muskrat did so, but when he returned with his paws filled with earth he discovered the small quantity he had first deposited on the turtle's shell had doubled in size.  The return from the third trip found the turtle's load again doubled.  So the building went on at double compound increase, and the world grew its continents and its island with great rapidity, and now rests on the shell of a turtle.\n\nIf you ask an Iroquois, \"And did no men survive this flood?\" he will reply, \"Why should men survive?  The animals are wiser than men; let the wisest live.\"\n\nHow, then, was the earth re-peopled?\n\nThe Iroquois will tell you that the otter was a medicine man; that in swimming and diving about he found corpses of men and women; he sang his medicine songs and they came to life, and the otter brought them fish for food until they were strong enough to provide for themselves.  Then the Iroquois will conclude his tale with, \"You know well that the otter has greater wisdom than a man.\"\n\nSo much for \"mine own people\" and our profound respect for the superior intelligence of our little brothers of the animal world.\n\nBut the Squamish tribe hold other ideas. It was on a February day that I first listened to this beautiful, humane story of the Deluge. My royal old tillicum had come to see me through the rains and mists of late winter days.  The gateways of my wigwam always stood open--very widely open--for his feet to enter, and this especial day he came with the worst downpour of the season.\n\nWomanlike, I protested with a thousand contradictions in my voice that he should venture out to see me on such a day.  It was \"Oh! Chief, I am so glad to see you!\" and it was \"Oh! Chief, why didn't you stay at home on such a wet day--your poor throat will suffer.\" But I soon had quantities of hot tea for him, and the huge cup my own father always used was his--as long as the Sagalie Tyee allowed his dear feet to wander my way.  The immense cup stands idle and empty now for the second time.\n\nHelping him off with his great-coat, I chatted on about the deluge of rain, and he remarked it was not so very bad, as one could yet walk.\n\n\"Fortunately, yes, for I cannot swim,\" I told him.\n\nHe laughed, replying, \"Well, it is not so bad as when the Great Deep Waters covered the world.\"\n\nImmediately I foresaw the coming legend, so crept into the shell of monosyllables.\n\n\"No?\" I questioned.\n\n\"No,\" he replied.  \"For one time there was no land here at all; everywhere there was just water.\"\n\n\"I can quite believe it,\" I remarked caustically.", "timestamp": 1635906682, "digest": "Sz1lhlEnjklaUX7CSEAVpPLjB_PjxGdEcPGme__azvQ", "contributor": "0x9fEBE8Fef2023A1471822697F2EE016e30D61953"}

Each piece is a reflection of her children's true essence and represents an emotion we have shared with our parents and grandparents. Together in unity here and now, we celebrate the “Fabric of Life” and your existence in the first dimension, by looking into the mirror of the second dimension we are reminded how to be evolution, patient, and kind. In the third dimension, we are introduced to the concept of time by remembering the past, present, and future and with our emotions, and in this fourth dimension, we bring you the “Fabric of Life” DAO which actually has the purpose of creating more and more digital art in the metaverse and a mission of creating a different kind of buzz...\n\nWe intend on co-creating a message of love, balanced emotions, and a “Fabric of Life” fairy tale with NFT’s for ”Little People” everywhere to enjoy for the rest of time. After the crowdfund has ended and the collection of 111 “Fabric of Life” NFT’s have all been released we intend on using the collection for a special animated “Fabric of Life” Storybook NFT in Aid of the [Bumblebee Conservation Trust](https://www.bumblebeeconservation.org/).\n\n### The Artist\n\nThe [RonX111](https://ronx111.com/) collection is slowly being released as a unique Storybook NFT and rare animated NFTs. RonX111 is an authentic street artist with all prints and holding the stencils, as well as the actual original artworks. RonX111 was born in Australia and is a street activist, he has a primary focus on bringing balance to all and ensuring the things he loves from family to nature are preserved. He has the ability to make immediate and concrete moves if he believes his higher level is at risk.\n\nRonX111 uses nature and the leading street artists in the world to deliver very timely and deep messages for all, even if it takes time to understand the message being delivered. He sees nature in ways many do not like it’s the thing that brings light to his dark nights and the Sun is what reactivates Ron back into the reality that we all live in. His messages can be very kind and very hard it depends on the temperature of the moment. RonX111 is focused on mother nature, protecting and fighting for the greater universe that will be left in place, not fighting for today he fights for years ahead and every action has a consequence.\n\n[crowdfund://0x9C7621df511f44A1aC13E3cAe102e45f17f1FB09?features=overview,editions,podium,backers](crowdfund://0x9C7621df511f44A1aC13E3cAe102e45f17f1FB09?features=overview,editions,podium,backers)\n\n### The Animation Studio\n\n[The XStudio](https://thexstudio.io/) is in partnership with [RonX111](https://ronx111.com/), and [Destrola](https://www.destrola.com/) is the animation artist for this project. Together they take the original art to animation for the NFT market, while they still focus on their unique crafts globally. Consider the life of a Destrola as a curious child, one in which every day was another opportunity to understand and evolve the world around them. Now imagine that child always blending into the background; never defining who they are and usually playing second fiddle to friends and family.\n\nAt a certain point, there is a switch and drive to move out of the shadows. In this successful venture, they redefine themselves and realize that they have a knack for understanding perceptions and can use their skills to influence that. Moving forward Destrola forges a career in animation and design; spending time with clients to understand the questions that need to be asked and creating solutions that answer them. At the age of 23 Destrola starts pivoting into the realm of education and became a lecturer and tutor at a university; reevaluating the base understandings and helping students begin to question their own perspective of the world through their designs and creations\n\n## 1/111 Believe\n\n**To believe is to have faith and confidence that your existence is love and truth manifested in the physical plain.

It was a box office failure.\n\nThe title, refers to \"Ghosts\", consciousness stored in computer minds with cyborg bodies, \"Shells\".\n\nOn one level, it's a police story.\n\nIn 2029 Japan, “Major Motoko Kusanagi” is a government agent is chasing a hacker, 'The Pupper Master'.\n\nThe Major is also a cyborg, a human with a machine body. The \"Puppet Master\" is an A.I. made by another agency. After journeying through different networks, the A.I. became self-aware, and a threat to its creators.\n\nOn a deeper layer, the film was an exploration by a director who believed a film \"about the influence and power of computers... was more effectively conveyed through animation\".\n\nThe film was made with both traditional 'cel' film animation and CGI. The movie's futuristic city was based on 20th century Hong Kong - a city that is a hybrid between the past and the future.\n\nA sound studio used various sources, including spatializers to evoke the feel of electronic brain conversations, Japanese pop, Bulgarian harmonies with folk singers, and a theme from U2 and Brian Eno.\n\nSome of the story was borrowed in \"The Matrix\" trilogy, and James Cameron credited the film as one of his inspirations for \"Avatar\".\n\nDespite the bad box office, there was a sequel in 2004, soundtracks, books and an animated series. The director released a second version in 2008.\n\nFollowups made more money than the original film.\n\nThere was a 2021 IMAX restoration, 26 years after the debut.\n\nWhen the film came out, the Internet was still new, robots couldn't walk upright yet, and 'A.I.' was in its infancy.\n\n**2877 EARTH, THE NECKLACE, MARS CONSULATE**\n\nI got out of the floater, and walked into the consulate.\n\nI went back to the secure room, and opened the vault, and put the package on the table.

[自举编译器](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_\\(compilers\\)) 是用它们编译的语言编写的编译器，例如 Go 编译器。这是通过称为引导的过程完成的。\n2.  [源到源编译器](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler) 是用另一种已经有编译器的语言编写的编译器。\n\n如果你要从头开始编写新的编程语言，则需要一个可执行应用程序来编译你的编译器！ 你需要一个编译器来执行任何事情，所以当开发新语言时，它们通常首先用更老的、更成熟的语言编写。\n\n还有一些可用的工具可以读取语言规范并创建解析器。 流行的编译器-编译器（compiler-compilers）包括 GNU Bison、Yacc 和 ANTLR。\n\n> 如果你想了解有关解析器的更多信息，请查看 [lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) 项目。 Lark 是一个用 Python 编写的上下文无关语法解析器。\n\n编译器引导的一个很好的例子是 Go 编程语言。 第一个 Go 编译器是用 C 编写的，然后一旦 Go 可以编译了，就用 Go 重写编译器。\n\nCPython 保留了 C 语言的传统；许多标准库模块，如 ssl 模块或套接字模块，都是用 C 编写的，用于访问低级操作系统 API。 Windows 和 Linux 内核中用于[创建网络套接字](https://realpython.com/python-sockets/)、 [使用文件系统](https://realpython.com/working-with-files-in-python/)或 [与显示器交互](https://realpython.com/python-gui-with-wxpython/)的 API 都是用 C 编写的。 Python 的可扩展性层专注于 C 语言是有意义的。\n\n有一个用 Python 编写的 Python 编译器，称为 PyPy。 PyPy 的标志是一个 [衔尾蛇](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros)，代表编译器的自举性质。\n\nPython 交叉编译器的另一个示例是 Jython。Jython 是用 Java 编写的，从 Python 源代码编译成 Java 字节码。 与 CPython 可以轻松导入 C 库并从 Python 中使用它们一样，Jython 可以轻松导入和引用 Java 模块和类。\n\n创建编译器的第一步是定义语言。 例如，一下不是有效的 Python：\n\n    def my_example() <str> :\n    {\n        void* result = ;\n    }\n\n编译器在尝试执行之前需要严格的语言语法结构规则。\n\n> 对于本书的其余部分，`./python` 将指代 CPython 的编译版本。 但是，实际命令将取决于你的操作系统。\n>\n> 对于 Windows：\n>\n>     > > python.exe\n>     >\n\n> 对于 Linux：\n>\n>     > $ ./python\n>     >\n\n> 对于 macOS：\n>\n>     > $ ./python.exe\n>     >\n\n## Python 语言规范\n\nCPython 源代码中包含 Python 语言的定义。这个文档是所有 Python 解释器使用的参考规范。\n\n该规范采用人类可读和机器可读的格式。文档里面是对 Python 语言的详细解释。包含允许的内容以及每个语句的行为方式。\n\n### 语言文档\n\n位于 `Doc/reference` 目录中的是 Python 语言中每个功能的 [reStructured-Text](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) 解释。 这些文件构成了 [docs.python.org/3/reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/) 上的官方 Python 参考指南。\n\n目录里面是你需要了解整个语言、结构和关键字的文件：\n\n    cpython/Doc/reference/\n    ├── compound_stmts.rst          复合语句，如 if、while、for 和函数定义\n    ├── datamodel.rst               对象、值和类型\n    ├── executionmodel.rst          Python程序的结构\n    ├── expressions.rst             Python 表达式的元素\n    ├── grammar.rst                 Python 的核心语法（参考 Grammar/Grammar）\n    ├── import.rst                  导入系统\n    ├── index.rst                   语言参考索引\n    ├── introduction.rst            参考文档介绍\n    ├── lexical_analysis.rst        词法结构，如行、缩进、标记和关键字\n    ├── simple_stmts.rst            简单的语句，如 assert、import、return 和 yield\n    └── toplevel_components.rst     执行 Python 的方式的描述，如脚本和模块\n\n### 一个例子\n\n在 `Doc/reference/compound_stmts.rst`，你可以看到一个定义 `with` 语句的简单示例。\n\n`with` 语句有多种形式，最简单的是上下文管理器的实例化和嵌套的代码块：\n\n    with x():\n        ...\n\n你可以使用 `as` 关键字将结果分配给变量：\n\n    with x() as y:\n        ...\n\n你还可以使用逗号将上下文管理器链接在一起：\n\n    with x() as y, z() as jk:\n        ...\n\n文档包含语言的人类可读规范，机器可读规范包含在单个文件 `Grammar Grammar` 中。\n\n### 语法文件\n\n> 本节指的是“旧解析器”使用的语法文件。 在发布时，“新解析器”（PEG 解析器）是实验性的，尚未完成。\n>\n> 对于 3.8 及以下版本的 CPython，默认使用 pgen 解析器。 对于 CPython 3.9 及更高版本，PEG 解析器是默认的。可以在命令行上使用 `-X oldparser` 启用旧解析器。\n>\n> 两个解析器都使用 `Tokens` 文件。\n\n语法文件以一种称为[巴科斯范式](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) (BNF) 的上下文符号编写。 巴科斯范式不是 Python 特有的，通常用作许多其他语言中的语法符号。\n\n编程语言中语法结构的概念受到 [Noam Chomsky 在 1950 年代关于句法结构的工作](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_Structures)的启发！\n\nPython 的语法文件使用扩展巴科斯范式（EBNF）规范和正则表达式语法。因此，在语法文件中，你可以使用：\n\n*   `*` 用于重复\n*   `+` 至少重复一次\n*   `[]` 用于可选部分\n*   `|` 对于替代品\n*   `()` 用于分组\n\n例如，考虑如何定义一杯咖啡：\n\n*   它必须有一个杯子\n*   它必须包括至少一瓶浓缩咖啡（espresso），并且可以包含多个\n*   它可以有牛奶，但可选\n*   你可以在咖啡中加入多种牛奶，如全脂、脱脂和豆奶（soy）\n\n在 EBNF 中定义的咖啡订单可能如下所示：\n\n    coffee: 'cup' ('espresso')+ ['water'] [milk]\n    milk: 'full-fat' | 'skimmed' | 'soy'\n\n在本章中，语法是用铁路图形象化的。 这张图是咖啡语句的铁路图：\n\n![coffee_statement](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3297411/130769007-ecd75282-7d28-4d9f-9904-60cba7b83350.png)\n\n在铁路图中，每个可能的组合必须从左到右排成一条线。 可选语句可以被绕过，有些语句可以形成循环。\n\n如果在语法文件中搜索 `with_stmt`，可以看到定义：\n\n    with_stmt: 'with' with_item (',' with_item)*  ':' suite\n    with_item: test ['as' expr]\n\n引号中的任何内容都是字符串文字，称为终端（terminal）。终端是识别关键字的方式。`with_stmt` 指定为：\n\n1.  从 `with` 开始\n2.  后面跟一个 `with_item`，它可以是 `test`，和（可选的） `as` 以及一个表达式 `expr`\n3.  接着是一个或多个 `with_item`，每个都用逗号隔开\n4.  以 `:` 结尾\n5.  跟一个 `suite`\n\n在这两行中引用了其他三个定义：\n\n• `suite` 是指包含一个或多个语句的代码块 • `test` 指的是一个被评估的简单的语句 • `expr` 指的是一个简单的表达式\n\n在铁路图中可视化，`with` 语句如下所示：\n\n![with_stmt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3297411/130769199-d7db516f-fb2e-4a7d-ae4e-ca34f5c49d78.png)\n\n作为一个更复杂的例子，`try` 语句定义为：\n\n    try_stmt: ('try' ':' suite\n               ((except_clause ':' suite)+\n                ['else' ':' suite]\n                ['finally' ':' suite] |\n               'finally' ':' suite))\n    except_clause: 'except' [test ['as' NAME]]\n\n`try` 语句有两种用途：\n\n1.  `try` 和一个或多个 `except` 子句，然后是一个可选的 `else`，然后是一个可选的 `finally`\n2.  `try` 和只有一个 `finally` 语句\n\n或者，在铁路图中可视化：\n\n![try_stmt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3297411/130769305-3fc27399-a211-48ae-92c9-780885c2ca03.png)\n\n`try` 语句是更复杂结构的一个很好的例子。\n\n如果你想详细了解 Python 语言，语法在 `Grammar/Grammar` 中定义。\n\n## 使用解析器生成器（The Parser Generator）\n\nPython 编译器从不使用语法文件本身。相反，解析器表由解析器生成器创建。 如果对语法文件进行更改，则必须重新生成解析器表并重新编译 CPython。\n\n解析器表是潜在解析器状态的列表。当解析树变得复杂时，它们确保语法不会有歧义。\n\n## 解析器生成器\n\n解析器生成器的工作原理是将 EBNF 语句转换为非确定性有限自动机 (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton，NFA)。 NFA 状态和转换被解析并合并为一个确定性有限自动机 (Deterministic Finite Automaton，DFA)。\n\nDFA 被解析器用作解析表。这种技术是[在斯坦福大学形成的](http://infolab.stanford.edu/\\~ullman/dragon/slides1.pdf)，并在 1980 年代开发，就在 Python 出现之前。 CPython 的解析器生成器 `pgen` 是 CPython 项目独有的。\n\n`pgen` 应用程序在 Python 3.8 中从 C 重写为 Python，在文件 `Parser/pgen/pgen.py` 中。\n\n它可通过以下执行：\n\n    $ ./python -m Parser.pgen [grammar] [tokens] [graminit.h] [graminit.c]\n\n它通常从构建脚本执行，而不是直接执行。\n\nDFA 和 NFA 没有视觉输出，但有一个带有有向图输出的 [CPython 分支](https://github.com/tonybaloney/cpython/tree/dot_pgen)。 `decorator` 语法在 `Grammar/Grammar` 中定义为：\n\n    decorator: '@' dotted_name [ '(' [arglist] ')' ] NEWLINE\n\n解析器生成器创建了一个包含 11 个状态的复杂 NFA 图。每个状态都用数字表示（在语法中提示它们的名称）。 状态转移被称为“弧”。\n\nDFA 比 NFA 更简单，路径减少了：\n\n![decorator_DFA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3297411/130769383-4c305c61-39c4-4239-934e-5fadf0fc5281.png)\n\nNFA 和 DFA 图仅用于调试复杂语法的设计。\n\n我们将使用铁路图代替 DFA 或 NFA 图来表示语法。例如，此图表示 `decorator` 语句可以采用的路径：\n\n![decorator_stmt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3297411/130769434-73eb6a03-e7a1-4baa-bd65-e7b467b49ec9.png)\n\n## 重新生成语法\n\n要查看 `pgen` 的运行情况，让我们更改部分 Python 语法。 在 `Grammar/Grammar` 中搜索 `pass_stmt` 以查看 `pass` 语句的定义：\n\n    pass_stmt: 'pass'\n\n![pass_stmt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3297411/130769494-9b57251f-38fe-4d3b-b8eb-73e49c831eda.png)\n\n通过添加选择 `|` 和 `proceed` 字面量，更改该行以接受终端（关键字）`'pass'` 或 `'proceed'` 作为关键字：\n\n    pass_stmt: 'pass' | 'proceed'\n\n![pass_stmt_modified](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3297411/130769525-5107b366-f299-4299-a31d-8573304203ec.png)\n\n接下来，通过运行 `pgen` 重建语法文件。CPython 带有脚本来自动化 `pgen`。\n\n在 macOS 和 Linux 上，运行 `make regen-grammar`：\n\n    $ make regen-grammar\n\n对于 Windows，从 PCBuild 目录调出命令行并使用 `--regen` 标志运行 `build.bat`：\n\n    > build.bat --regen\n\n你应该会看到一个输出，显示新的 `Include/graminit.h` 和 `Python/graminit.c` 文件已重新生成。\n\n使用重新生成的解析器表，当你重新编译 CPython 时，它将使用新语法。\n\n如果代码编译成功，你可以执行新的 CPython 二进制文件并启动 REPL。\n\n在 REPL 中，你现在可以尝试定义一个函数。不要使用 pass 语句， 而是使用你编译到 Python 语法中的 `proceed` 关键字替代 `pass`：\n\n    $ ./python -X oldparser\n    Python 3.9.0b1 (tags/v3.9.0b1:97fe9cf, May 19 2020, 10:00:00)\n    [Clang 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4)] on darwin\n    Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n    >>> def example():\n    ...    proceed\n    ...\n    >>> example()\n\n恭喜，你已经更改了 CPython 语法并编译了你自己的 CPython 版本。\n\n接下来，我们将探索标记（tokens）及其与语法的关系。\n\n### 标记（Tokens）\n\n除了 `Grammar` 文件夹中的语法文件之外，还有 `Grammar/Tokens` 文件， 其中包含在分析树中作为叶节点找到的每个唯一类型。每个标记还有一个名称和一个生成的唯一 ID。 名称用于使在分词器（tokenizer）中更容易引用。\n\n> `Grammar/Tokens` 文件是 Python 3.8 中的一项新功能。\n\n例如，左括号称为 `LPAR`，分号称为称为 `SEMI`。 你将在本书后面看到这些标记：\n\n    LPAR                    '('\n    RPAR                    ')'\n    LSQB                    '['\n    RSQB                    ']'\n    COLON                   ':'\n    COMMA                   ','\n    SEMI                    ';'\n\n和 `Grammar` 文件一样，如果你修改了 `Grammar/Tokens` 文件，你需要重新运行 `pgen`。\n\n要查看操作中的标记，你可以使用 CPython 中的 `tokenize` 模块。\n\n> CPython 源代码中有两个标记器。这里演示了一个用 Python 编写的分词器，另一个用 C 编写。 用 Python 编写的分词器是一个实用程序，Python 解释器使用用 C 编写的那个。 它们具有相同的输出和行为。用 C 编写的版本是为性能而设计的，而 Python 中的模块是为调试而设计的。\n\n`cpython-book-samples/13/test_tokens.py`:\n\n```\n\ndef my_function(): proceed\n```\n\n将 `test_tokens.py` 文件输入到标准库中内置的名为 `tokenize` 的模块中。你将按行和字符看到标记列表。 使用 `-e` 标志输出确切的标记名称：\n\n    $ ./python -m tokenize -e test_tokens.py\n\n    0,0-0,0:            ENCODING       'utf-8'        \n    1,0-1,18:           COMMENT        '# Demo application'\n    1,18-1,19:          NL             '\\n'           \n    2,0-2,3:            NAME           'def'          \n    2,4-2,15:           NAME           'my_function'  \n    2,15-2,16:          LPAR           '('            \n    2,16-2,17:          RPAR           ')'            \n    2,17-2,18:          COLON          ':'            \n    2,18-2,19:          NEWLINE        '\\n'           \n    3,0-3,4:            INDENT         '    '         \n    3,4-3,11:           NAME           'proceed'      \n    3,11-3,12:          NEWLINE        '\\n'           \n    4,0-4,0:            DEDENT         ''             \n    4,0-4,0:            ENDMARKER      ''\n\n在输出中，第一列是行/列坐标的范围，第二列是标记的名称，最后一列是标记的值。\n\n在输出中， `tokenize` 模块隐含了一些标记：\n\n*   `utf-8` 的 `ENCODING` 标记\n*   结尾的空白行\n*   `DEDENT` 关闭函数声明\n*   `ENDMARKER` 结束文件\n\n最佳做法是在 Python 源文件的末尾有一个空行。如果省略它，CPython 会为你添加它。\n\n`tokenize` 模块是用纯 Python 编写的，位于 `Lib/tokenize.py` 中。\n\n要查看 C 分词器的详细读数，您可以使用 `-d` 标志运行 Python。 使用之前创建的 `test_tokens.py` 脚本，使用以下命令运行它：\n\n    $ ./python -d test_tokens.py\n\n    Token NAME/'def' ... It's a keyword\n     DFA 'file_input', state 0: Push 'stmt'\n     DFA 'stmt', state 0: Push 'compound_stmt'\n    ...\n    Token NEWLINE/'' ... It's a token we know\n     DFA 'funcdef', state 5: [switch func_body_suite to suite] Push 'suite'\n     DFA 'suite', state 0: Shift.\n    Token INDENT/'' ... It's a token we know\n     DFA 'suite', state 1: Shift.\n    Token NAME/'proceed' ... It's a keyword\n     DFA 'suite', state 3: Push 'stmt'\n    ...\n    ACCEPT.\n\n在输出中，你可以看到它突出显示了作为关键字的 `proceed`。 在下一章中，我们将看到执行 Python 二进制文件是如何到达分词器的，以及从那里执行代码时会发生什么。\n\n> 要清理你的代码，请恢复 `Grammar/Grammar` 中的更改，再次重新生成语法，然后清理构建并重新编译：\n>\n> 对于 macOS 或 Linux：\n>\n>     > $ git checkout -- Grammar/Grammar\n>     > $ make regen-grammar\n>     > $ make clobber\n>     > $ make -j2 -s\n>     >\n\n> 对于 Windows：\n>\n>     > > git checkout -- Grammar/Grammar\n>     > > build.bat --regen\n>     > > build.bat -t CleanAll\n>     > > build.bat -t Build\n>     >\n\n## 一个更复杂的例子\n\n添加 `proceed` 作为 `pass` 的替代关键字是一个简单的更改， 解析器生成器将 `'proceed'` 作为 `pass_stmt` 标记的文字进行匹配。 这个新关键字无需对编译器进行任何更改即可工作。\n\n在实践中，对语法的大多数更改都更加复杂。\n\nPython 3.8 引入了赋值表达式，格式为 `:=`。赋值表达式既为名称赋值，又返回命名变量的值。 受在 Python 语言中添加赋值表达式影响的语句之一是 `if` 语句。\n\n在 3.8 之前，`if` 语句定义为：\n\n*   关键字 `if` 后跟 `test`，然后是 `:`\n*   嵌套的一系列语句（`suite`）\n*   零个或多个 `elif` 语句，后跟 `test`、一个 `:` 和 `suite`\n*   一个可选的 `else` 语句，后跟一个 `:` 和一个 `suite`\n\n在语法中，这表示为：\n\n    if_stmt: 'if' test ':' suite ('elif' test ':' suite)* ['else' ':' suite]\n\n可视化之后看起来像：\n\n为了支持赋值表达式，更改需要向后兼容。 因此，在 `if` 语句中使用 `:=` 必须是可选的。\n\n`if` 语句中使用的 `test` 标记类型在许多语句之间是通用的。例如，`assert` 语句后跟一个 `test`（然后是可选的第二个 `test`）。\n\n    assert_stmt: 'assert' test [',' test]\n\n在 3.8 中添加了替代 `test` 标记类型，以便语法可以规定哪些语句应该支持赋值表达式，哪些不应该支持。\n\n这个称为 `namedexpr_test`，在 `Grammer` 中定义为：\n\n    namedexpr_test: test [':=' test]\n\n或者，在铁路图中可视化为：\n\n![namedexpr_test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3297411/130769573-78634152-1b47-4ee8-9ca7-2f6b6e3ff4a1.png)\n\n`if` 语句的新语法已更改为用 `namedexpr_test` 替换 `test`：\n\n    if_stmt: 'if' namedexpr_test ':' suite ('elif' namedexpr_test ':' suite)\n            ['else' ':' suite]\n\n在铁路图中可视化：\n\n![if_stmt_with_namedexpr_test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3297411/130769666-b253d126-ab60-4eb5-8dd6-8e7ca3988282.png)\n\n为了区分 `:=` 和现有的 `COLON` (`:`) 和 `EQUAL` (`=`) 标记，将以下标记也添加到 `Grammar/Tokens` 中：\n\n    COLONEQUAL              ':='\n\n这不是支持赋值表达式所需的唯一更改。 如 [Pull Request](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/10497) 中所示，这一变化改变了 CPython 编译器的许多部分。\n\n> 有关 CPython 解析器生成器的更多信息，`pgen` 的作者在 PyCon Europe 2019 上录制了 有关实现和设计的演示文稿：“[野兽之魂](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1\\_23AVsiQEc)”。\n\n## 总结\n\n在本章中，你已经了解了 Python 语法定义和解析器生成器。 在下一章中，你将扩展该知识以构建更复杂的语法功能，即“几乎等于”运算符。\n\n在实践中，必须仔细考虑和讨论对 Python 语法的更改。审查水平有两个原因：\n\n1.  拥有“太多”的语言特性或复杂的语法会改变 Python 作为一种简单易读的语言的精神\n2.  语法更改引入向后不兼容，这给所有开发人员增加了工作\n\n如果 Python 核心开发人员提议对语法进行更改，则必须将其作为 Python 增强提案 (PEP) 提出。 所有 PEP 都在 PEP 索引上进行编号和索引。 [PEP 5](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0005/) 记录了语言发展的指南，并指定必须在 PEP 中提出更改。\n\n成员还可以通过 [python-ideas 邮件列表](https://www.python.org/community/lists/)建议对核心开发组之外的语言进行更改。\n\n你可以在 [PEP 索引](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/)中查看 CPython 未来版本的起草的、拒绝的和接受的 PEP。 一旦 PEP 达成共识，并且草案已定稿，指导委员会必须接受或拒绝它。 [PEP 13](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0013/) 中定义的指导委员会的任务规定， 他们应努力“维护 Python 语言和 CPython 解释器的质量和稳定性”。\n\n###\n", "timestamp": 1635906725, "digest": "rjwQ7jbcZCD6A_xqoCet65i-MM9KEI7oJ325VR11OKE", "contributor": "0x169841AA3024cfa570024Eb7Dd6Bf5f774092088"}

{"id": "9l95tdhoeYzmTUZl4QkMWZlCvAWGydBDzHgMPEhA5J8", "title": "The Big Business Of Interpreting Interpolation", "body": "The sanctity of the song (and the songwriter) has been a subject of considerable discussion recently — from the overheated online debate over Olivia Rodrigo’s retroactively sharing songwriting credit with Paramore for their influence on her hit “Good 4 U,” to Hipgnosis head Merck Mercuriadis [sounding off about protecting songwriters](https://variety.com/2021/music/news/hipgnosis-merck-mercuriadis-open-letter-songwriter-1235070041/) in an open letter released on the same day the world biggest music company (and second-biggest music publisher) UMG went public for $55 billion.\n\nScrolling the Wikipedia page of “[Songs Subject to Plagiarism Disputes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_subject_to_plagiarism_disputes)” makes clear that fighting over soundalike songs is not a new phenomenon. But an increase in litigation is visible since the landmark 2013 case where the estate of Marvin Gaye took $5.3M off of Robyn Thicke and Pharrell Williams for “substantial similarities” between the former’s classic “Got To Give It Up” and the latter’s “Blurred Lines.” This high-profile case and subsequent trials held in court (and the court of public opinion) have put the very process of songwriting up for debate.\n\nOne of the more sensible voices in the conversation is Blake Robin (aka LUXXURY) whose TikToks on the topics of interpolation and other creative techniques have amassed 2.7M likes in recent months.\n\nWe spoke with Blake to get some answers that extend beyond TikTok’s 59-second limit.\n\n**You’ve been coming up a lot on TikTok for your takes on interpolation. How did that get started?**\n\nThe very first TikTok I posted was called “How To Steal Music,” which was obviously a tongue-in-cheek clickbait way of saying that if you're inspired by a song, can you do something about it? Well, you can sample it, you can cover it, or you can interpolate it. And I happened to start with interpolation because sampling has already been pretty widely covered.\n\nAnd suddenly in these past few months, because of the Olivia Rodrigo situation, interpolation has become much more a part of the vernacular.\n\n**Because of the trend of people on social media calling out similarities in songs.**\n\nThat was almost definitely a factor in the situation between Paramore and Olivia Rodrigo. It was such a huge meme. You couldn't escape it for a few weeks, hearing the two songs together.  But they were apparently in talks with the Paramore camp before the song came out. So who knows what happened there, specifically.\n\n\\*\\*How did you get interested in all this? \\*\\*\n\nMy interest is the topic of inspiration. I came to LA as a songwriter with a publishing deal with Razor & Tie. So my first job in the music industry, so to speak, was to write songs. I was in the studio doing co-writes with a different person almost every day. I would work with Bonnie McKee, who the next day would go work with Katy Perry and write “Teenage Dream.”\n\n**How common is it that songs are somehow derived from other works?**\n\nI would say that probably eight times out of ten that a songwriter sits down to write, there’s either a pre-existing idea in your head or you're listening to something and vibing on it. The fact that you have been influenced by something, inspired by something, and you're going to pay homage to it, that's always been understood to be the case.\n\nThere's this wonderful book called *Always Magic in the Air*, that talks about Brill Building teams in the sixties like Gerry Goffin & Carole King and Jerry Leiber & Mike Stoller. Writing songs was their day job. And there was a creative strategy they used called writing sideways. You would look at a hit and ask “What is it in this hit that we can borrow from?”\n\nA classic example is Four Tops “It’s The Same Old Song” on Motown. They literally took “Sugar Pie, Honey,” and redid it. It was an inside joke, the *same old song*.\n\nIn the modern era, we'd be like, let's get some of this Weezer energy. What is Weezer energy? It's the combination of the chord changes and the melodic shape and, with Weezer in particular, a very specific dry-sounding guitar. So you kind of pick some of the elements that speak to you and then you consider what you can do that is new and different, but uses some of these elements.\n\nWeezer is an interesting example because they so clearly did that with the Beach Boys with regards to their chord changes and their melodic structures. Plus the quiet/loud dynamic of the Pixies and Nirvana. Kurt Cobain also spoke many times talking about his love of the Pixies.\n\n**How much has that changed in the current environment?**\n\nAfter “Blurred Lines,” all these lawsuits got insane. You had to be careful what you said and what you did. I remember the conversation became, “Let's not tell anybody where this idea came from.”\n\n**So is this level of caution the new normal?**\n\nWell, we recently had the [Katy Perry “Dark Horse” case](https://variety.com/2020/music/news/katy-perry-dark-horse-reversal-1203537482/) and the [Led Zeppelin case](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-54423922#:\\~:text=The%20final%20possible%20legal%20challenge,revived%20on%20appeal%20in%202018.), both of which went in favor of the defendants. So everyone was sort of breathing out a little bit. Then with Olivia Rodrigo’s “Brutal,” you had Elvis Costello saying, “[This is fine by me.](https://twitter.com/ElvisCostello/status/1409567943520931847)” Then Lorde released “Solar Power,” and both [Primal Scream](https://www.nme.com/news/music/bobby-gillespie-everyone-in-primal-scream-is-really-flattered-that-lorde-was-influenced-by-loaded-2993250) and the [George Michael estate](https://pitchfork.com/news/george-michael-estate-gives-lorde-its-blessing-over-solar-power-and-freedom-90-similarities/) said they’re “flattered” by the imitation.\n\nUltimately, it's a calculation. How likely are they to sue? How big are they? Do I know their lawyer? Do they share management? All of this stuff factors into it.\n\n**That seems like a lot to consider when you’re just trying to write a song.**\n\nI think that copyright law is garbage. And I say that as much as I make stuff that I wouldn't want to be stolen. There's part of me that's got a vested interest in protecting the creator. It just doesn't work that way in practice. It's really not protecting the creator as much as it's protecting Disney. And it's really just protecting IP that generally benefits the Marvin Gaye estate. Who's getting that money? I don't know these people, but you kind of picture the deadbeat cousins who were like, how can we squeeze a few more dollars out of cousin Marvin?\n\n**What is the solution?**\n\nI'll give a shoutout to a group that I'm a part of called Songwriters of North America that was started by Michelle Lewis and Kay Hanley. Songwriters need to band together to make sure that we are represented when there is a new settlement with radio, or whatever. There's always some sort of activity going on.\n\n***Want to collaborate with The Cadence? [Contact us.](https://glmww.com/)***\n\n## ", "timestamp": 1635909237, "digest": "s_29US1xaf_2GrEWyn9RKcJfsd1bnukoH3KNllGX7Zo", "contributor": "0xDD37d95a709349A00381d6d394c4CECc736E8B7c"}

{"id": "RuWnJ-dUyOt3ExVsS0cEJin1VYbE3gGvKIEVsvGBkC8", "title": "Building Remote work 3.0 with oVice", "body": "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*F4MGE9hIMq7duTEf)\n\nWhat it looks like to work on oVice’s virtual office\n\nRemote work is ubiquitous in the workplace today. What happens if we take it one step further? Virtual offices. I’ve been long excited about this growing trend of Virtual HQ and whether it’s during pandemic or post-pandemic, I am confident that virtual offices are here to stay.\n\nVirtual office is a superior platform — it enables companies to work with talents across different geographies (making it a critical component for any company out there trying to hire the best talents around the world). While remote work has been proven to be efficient for employees in various industries, *existing remote work tools lack spontaneity and fluidity, resulting in less creativity.* Virtual offices allow individuals to build trust and foster genuine relationships. From employee onboarding and training, company town hall to sales meetings, almost every meeting we used to host in-person in physical offices can now be done in virtual offices.\n\nFor the last 12+months, I’ve been living in the world of Slack, Zoom, and Google Meet. If not for those, I don’t know how I would have survived through working remotely in this bazaar covid era. But I did find myself with significantly fewer opportunities to bond and engage in casual conversations with my colleagues. On top of video calling and messaging, what I really needed was \\*one place where I can instantly hop on a chat, ask a question, get an instant reply, jumpstraight into discussions and brainstorming \\*without having to schedule a call, create a call link, copy-paste to share the link and so on and so forth.\n\n> Remote work 1.0 = Google Docs, Slack\n>\n> Remote work 2.0 = Zoom, Google Meet\n>\n> Remote work 3.0 = oVice, Gather\n\n*Remote work is here to stay and there is a growing demand for new tools that empower employees to collaborate more efficiently and productively.* Virtual offices increase transparency across an organisation and enhance company culture in a virtual setting.\n\nThis is why I was so excited to meet Sae Hyung and learn about what his team was building at [oVice](https://ovice.in/index.html). *oVice offers virtual offices that are replicas of physical office experiences but better.* With oVice, employees can video chat with a single click, collaborate (eg. open Google docs, whiteboards, Figma) and effortlessly join in and out of watercooler conversations. These functions enable employees to build relationships and trust as they then have visibility on who is working on what, understand what’s happening on the other side of the team. In addition, you can decorate your virtual office with wonderful designs that might not have been available for your physical office.\n\nOf course, more people will return to physical offices after the pandemic but the way we work will be a more robust mix of virtual and physical spaces. This is why oVice focuses on *optimising hybrid communication* (online+offline/virtual+physical). They are currently working on a 360-degree camera that can be integrated into virtual offices (oVice) to enable seamless communication with physical offices.\n\nCompanies like En-Japan, Dentsu, and Itochu use oVice to build their virtual offices. And the list of companies goes on in multiple geographies. Some of them realised their employees’ productivity and satisfaction increased working at oVice so they got rid of their physical offices, saving tons of rent.\n\nAs an investor, I get excited about founders first and foremost. And Sae Hyung immediately impressed me with his experience, passion to create a more productive environment, and his *vision for how oVice could disrupt the global office real estate market.* Sae Hyung is an engineer himself and one of the things he focuses on is the basics, to offer absolutely amazing sound quality (if you have been living on Zoom like me, you will know how important this is).\n\nIf you’re at a company that values transparency, inclusion, creativity, and collaboration, come and check out oVice. I’m thrilled to partner with them on their journey.

Great listen - definitely recommend.\n\nHopefully, this post will clarify some things surrounding NFT's and Web3. If you have any Q's or want anything explained- don’t hesitate. These are crazy times, but we're really in a pivotal period of the Internet - we will look back at these monopolies of data harvesting, ad-based corporations and laugh. The future is open-source protocols where we interact with each other directly, not through gatekeepers like FB, Twitter, or anything.\n\nWithout further ado...\n\n\\*\n\nSo an NFT should be thought of as a base-level building block of the Internet - something that is as versatile and programmable as a webpage.\n\nNow remember the 90's!? (of course I don’t, but I've heard stories...)\n\nWhen the Internet started to hit mainstream - there was an impulse to apply current trends to this new medium. ie. upload magazines, newspapers and static information basically. This is known as skeuomorphism (trying to map real-life onto digital) and is a natural human thing, it never works very well though and eventually we evolve to better things.\n\nVery few predicted the applications we would see 10-20years down the line. Uber, Airbnb, Netflix, Amazon, Youtube, Tiktok and Facebook, Gaming, Fortnite - the list goes on.\n\nSo the thing that the NFT protocol allows - is digital property rights, and digital ownership. This is huge.\n\n\\*\n\nAn analogy:\n\nImagine if every time you went into a restaurant/hotel, the staff kindly requested that you took off all your clothes and used their supplied ones. And once you decided to leave, you had to leave everything behind and go put on fresh clothes for the next business. This is what we are all used to with the current Web2 model. Web3 and NFTs allow true INTEROPERABILITY between EVERYTHING. The applications are so much more than just supply chain management, ticketing, royalties for artists, digital swords and clothes etc.\n\nOnce you have digital scarcity and provable digital ownership, you can map real world items (real estate, commodities, anything!) onto the digital, with the scarcity programmed in. This is more than people throwing money at the next animal-related JPGs and hoping they win the golden ticket.\n\nThis is just the beginning of social tokens and communities forming around digital assets (GOAT token anyone...?) that work to align the incentives of community members and organisers. Tokens and NFT's allow a totally new relationship in an organisation, as its not an owner-employee relationship anymore, but each member has skin in the game (via owning tokens) and gets to participate and benefit from the value that is created by the community. This is why there isn't a single crypto project that spends $ on marketing. When people own a piece of the project, and believe in what they are doing - they tell people!\n\n\\*\n\nNow if this all hurts your head, that’s okay. I know. It's a lot. Trying to wrap your head around this stuff is icky. And if you feel like you missed the boat, don’t worry. If you went all in on flickr or delicious in the 90's - then you would've missed the biggest innovations that came 5-10 years later.\n\nWe are still so early.\n\nThere’s 4.6Billion Internet connected users. The current amount of wallets and addresses on the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks is estimated to be 3-4% of the global population. The largest estimates say 300mil.\n\nYou are part of the 3%.

{"id": "ylR9VABw2N3mR-p7tC3TRWO-6ffl-dU7MQsJ3vrAyIA", "title": "Lets go MEME", "body": "Doge与Shib是人们讨论最多的MEME代币，它们两个的涨幅十分疯狂，让几乎所有价值投资者都大跌眼镜。为什么它们能够如此疯狂？\n\n### 从众\n\n一谈到MEME，我脑海里产生的第一词是从众。羊群效应作为心理学中的经典理论，很好地解释了这一点，这可以追溯至进化心理学分支：人类有从众本能，因为在远古时期，世界充满危险，人们稍有不慎就可能会丧命，再加上人类获取信息的能力及其有限，因此在面对不确定的事物时，会更多地遵循同伴的意见（尤其是地位较高的同伴）。从众一直存在于我们的基因中，并在这个互联网时代被无限放大。\n\n但是，不是所有事物都能让人“从众”的，它们得具备一定的易传播基础，我们来看看Shib和Doge。首先，这两个代币的代表形象都是柴犬（理论上Doge是柴犬的一种）。Doge有一系列表情包在社交软件上被人们熟知，而Shib作为柴犬的统称，以其有趣可爱的样貌，治愈的笑容***深得人们的喜爱***。这使得Shiba和Doge在人们的脑海里已形成了一定的***条件反射***；再者，Doge和Shiba这两个单词并不复杂且读起来朗朗上口，很容易让人留下深刻印象并保留在长时记忆中，当一个事物能以不同的方式刺激人的大脑时尤其如此（这也是为什么很多人演讲或汇报时喜欢用PPT，即文字与图片的结合，有时还会加上音乐）。\n\n***Shib和Doge在拥有易传播特性的同时，还有从众心理和互联网的加持，再加上资本市场带有的逐利性，四种因素产生的化学反应构成了一个强大的助推器，能够瞬间让MEME火箭升空。***\n\n### 普遍性文化价值\n\n互联网的强连接性和匿名性让人们可以随时随地进行沟通，且可以放下心理包袱诉说自己的观点，这一定程度上加速了社区文化的发展：有相同兴趣，爱好的人群聚集在一起，成为一个群体，他们会在现实或网络上建立属于自己根据地。***在此现状下，要用一个文化价值体系聚集大量人群显然比以前更有难度，Shiba给出的答案是：慈善。***\n\n不知其有意为之还是无意，Vitalik将10亿美金的Shib捐给印度抗疫，让Shiba获得了大量印度人与众多慈善爱好者的关注。慈善是让所有人都无法拒绝的概念，不管你属于punk还是oldschool，是中国人还是美国人，是大人还是小孩，是男人还是女人，你都不会拒绝慈善（即使不捐款，也不会反对）。因为这属于人文关怀，而人文关怀是这个时代最重要的，带有普遍性的价值理念之一。在印度人的眼中，Shib不仅仅是柴犬，也不仅仅是一个数字货币，它还代表着善良和慈悲。在Shib暴力拉升之后，在各个公链出现的大量慈善概念协议（例如TerraShiba）也侧面印证了“慈善”概念的威力。\n\n以下两段内容从Mindao Yang老师的推特截取：\n\n*“当时，远在印度修行的姐姐同个庙里的僧人托我帮他买75美金的Shib，我当时听错了，以为是说Shiva (这是印度的一个神），我说从来没听过这个币。后来澄清了是Shib。这个事情刚好发生在Vitalik捐了十几亿美金的Shib给印度资助Covid灾情的时候。”（2021.10.24）*\n\n*My sister’s Pujari (temple priest) friends in India asked me to help buy $75 of SHIB, they‘re the remotest crypto users I ever resonate with, Vitalik’s donation alter SHIB's adoption trajectory/value pro; meme’s best value pro is no-value, no hatred, no enemy, no tribalism。（2021.5.25）*\n\n### KOL\n\nElon musk作为带有强大个人魅力的KOL，对Doge的拉升起到了巨大的作用。马斯克本身已凭借自身的影响力聚集了大量粉丝，**其自带“权威”**属性可以让他的粉丝无条件跟随：在同等条件下，人们会更信任“资深人士”的发言，即使他们发言毫无道理。\n\n一方面，musk喊单的推特会引爆其粉丝的情绪，支持musk的粉丝会跟随musk大量购买Doge，另一方面，在资本市场逐利性的加持下，“买Doge就能一夜暴富”的想法逐渐深入到了人们的脑海里，“大家都买Doge，大家一起暴富”的观念成为了Doge 开启疯狂上涨的引爆点。\n\n### 如何选择王牌MEME\n\n综上，我认为一个王牌MEME代币不仅要具备形象亲民，易传播，能够输出带有普遍性的文化价值，有KOL喊单加持的特点，其代币最好还能具备合理的经济机制（Shib比Doge做的更好）。\n\n另外，受到协议Klima的启发（其为OHM仿盘，但创新地把碳中和指数引入其金库中，旨在为实现碳中和目标作出贡献），**我认为团队若能够做事为其代币赋能，效果可能会更好。**Shiba的代码虽然是抄袭Uniswap的，但若其能参考UNI，利用Shiba生态（生态中含有代币leash和bone）围绕慈善不断制造更多的大事件，让Shib代币在名为慈善的价值理念中更进一步，那么我想，Shib币价不断创出新高的可能性是很大的，它甚至可能会在此过程中逐渐淡化MEME的标签，并在某一时刻蜕变，真正成为新时代慈善的代名词，转变为“价值币”。\n\n### 投资策略\n\nShiba和Doge作为MEME代币的代表，具有**高波动性，爆发力强**的特点。同时，他们的上涨很大程度上取决于大事件（印度抗灾或Elon musk喊单），因此我们需要特别注意风险。MEME币取决于共识，但人类的共识往往是十分片面的，具有反身性。因此，MEME的大行情跟社会大事件一样，是不可预测的。\n\n举个例子，我们最熟悉的，也是Doge最疯狂的两次上涨来自于2021年1月牛市爆发和2021年4月接近牛市末期，看上去Doge跟牛市的周期有关，但2020年7月6日的拉升却跟牛市毫无关系，ETH在同年20日开启连续拉升，DOGE却在6日拉升后持续走低。\n\n再看最近的Shiba，虽然表面上的原因可能是慈善，但很显然这十分滞后（我认为最直接的信号还是多个巨鲸地址提前埋伏）。Shiba爆发的同时，上一轮牛市同样涨幅爆炸的Akita（秋田），Pig等MEME在这一轮的涨幅却十分有限。当然，如果将其类比Doge2020年7月的拉升，那这很可能预示着一波狂暴牛市即将到来（但我认为没必要预测）。\n\n综上，我的观点是：不要试图重仓参与，而是用提前埋伏+监控资金+上杠杆的方法（我个人是1%的资金+10倍杠杆），牛市最疯狂的时候卖出，在熊市结束后重新买入；因为上一轮是Doge，这一轮是Shiba，下一轮可能是Doge，可能是Shiba也可能是其他币，并且Shiba能否维持在高位还不好说（可能在这一轮牛市结束之后，它会跟Doge一样在高点陨落）。\n\n**1，右端杠铃策略**\n\nMEME的意思是模因，用通俗的话来说是文化基因，而文化是一个很特殊的东西，它带有极强的时代特色（在排除复古的情况下，上个世纪的潮流文化放到现在显然不会火，反过来也一样），并且需要时间的检验，这就表明其实如果要投资“文化币”，我们将会面临巨大的不确定性和滞后性，因为我们发现它的价值往往是在它涨完之后，并且由于MEME本身不具备价值支撑，其币价在拉升之后能否维持在高位还有待检验（Doge没做到，Shib还需观察），因此不适合重仓长期持有。\n\n在这种情况下，我们可以使用塔勒布的杠铃策略：按上文的筛选标准筛选出MEME头牌，小仓位分别持有它们，只要有其中一个爆发，将会弥补所有的亏损并且大幅盈利。\n\n**2，高杠杆策略**\n\n在Shib拉升之前，数据网站Nasen已提前显示有大量资金买入Shib，可见Nasen在预测王牌MEME币时可能具有一定的参考价值（参考标的过少，因此仅为可能），可以暂时作为其中一个参考指标。另一方面，Shib和Doge的走势有“拉升-走平盘整-再拉升”的High tight风格，因此，我们可以持续关注王牌MEME币，并在数据网站显示其有大量资金流入后用小仓位+高杠杆进行布局，并在第一次拉升结束之后降低杠杆，在第二次拉升结束之后视情况降低或去除杠杆，把判断失误所造成的损失降到最低。", "timestamp": 1635914886, "digest": "HUjIYDRtMU4w81pxfbn3OcogcshtMdvbjyih_AgZTLc", "contributor": "0x455E0e9d8b0c0541F4f26ECeec2Ea54504e9b4C9"}
{"id": "SreYJF_R2topnEar2EfLKM8PR-zuOwRla3sdNAM31A4", "title": "$ENS Token Allocation (Claiming Opens Nov 8)", "body": "Since we [announced that ENS would be launching a DAO](https://ens.mirror.xyz/) and $ENS token to govern key components of the ENS protocol, we’ve had a lot of inquiries as to how the DAO will be structured and what the token airdrop to community members will look like.\n\nHere’s an overview of what we have planned.\n\n## ENS Token and DAO Overview\n\nThe core components of ENS are decentralized and self-running (e.g., no one can take away another person’s .ETH name), but there are a few things that require some human discretion.\n\nDuring the first week of the claim process, community members will vote directly on a [proposed ENS Constitution](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/proposed-ens-constitution/814), a set of rules and guidelines for the community.\n\nAfter that, and in its first act as a DAO, $ENS token holders will vote on a proposal to formally request from the root key holders the ability to:\n\n* govern protocol parameters, like .ETH pricing, the price oracle, and more\n* control funds from the existing community treasury, as well as receive future revenue.\n\nProposals will require the support of at least 100k tokens to go to a vote and a simple majority voting to approve with a quorum of at least 1% of all tokens.\n\nClaims will open on November 8, 2021. Users will be encouraged to delegate their voting power to a community member that represents their views ([call for delegates](https://ens.mirror.xyz/cfvfKRpQSPtZJjPQOprWqEeqv2rytE7tQkxDg6ht7Oo)) and will have **until May 4th, 2022 to claim their tokens, after which any remaining tokens will be sent to the DAO treasury**.\n\nWe have established an organization called The ENS Foundation in the Cayman Islands to legally represent the DAO, e.g. fulfill any tax obligations. The foundation's articles of incorporation give token holders the right to appoint and dismiss directors, and to instruct the foundation to take real-world actions. More details are available [here](https://ens.gitbook.io/ens-dao-governance-docs/).\n\n## ENS Constitution\n\nAs part of the claim process, those claiming $ENS tokens will vote on a [proposed ENS Constitution](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/proposed-ens-constitution/814). The ENS Constitution is a set of rules and guidelines for the ENS community on how ENS should be governed. For an article to pass, it’ll need 67% approval of all votes cast in the first week of the token launch.\n\nThe Constitution can always be amended by the ENS DAO in the future with a threshold of 67% approval and a quorum of 5% of total tokens.\n\n## ENS Token Distribution\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/24CmedtTQqbGg8OuVlTxO.png?height=1200&width=2400&&&size=medium)\n\nThe contract address for $ENS is token.ensdao.eth (0xC18360217D8F7Ab5e7c516566761Ea12Ce7F9D72).\n\nThe $ENS token distribution is as follows:\n\n* 25% airdrop to .ETH holders (>137k accounts)\n* 25% to ENS contributors (>100 individuals and groups, plus hundreds of Discord users)\n* 50% to the DAO community treasury\n\n### Airdrop to users\n\nThe 25% of the total supply allocated for the $ENS airdrop to users will be distributed to all addresses that are or have been the registrant of a .ETH second-level domain. The distribution is based on the total time of an address's past registration and future registration as of October 31st, 2021.\n\nThe total time of future registrations is capped at 8 years. Importantly, **the retroactive airdrop is per account, not per name**. This means that each address is counted for a given day based on whether it owns at least one .ETH name on that day.\n\nThe airdrop also features a 2x multiplier for Ethereum accounts that have set their Primary ENS Name (formerly known as Reverse Record), since this is an indicator that someone is an active user.\n\nThe airdrop formula is roughly:\n\n0\\.27 \\* (# days the account owned at least one ENS name)\n\n\\+\n\n0\\.067 \\* (# days until the expiration of the last name on the account)\n\nThe total is then multiplied by 2 if the account also has a Primary ENS Name set.\n\nWe recognize that this will be disappointing to some users who only own subdomains or DNS domains imported to ENS. Given that the initial purpose of the DAO is to govern the parameters of the .ETH registrar, and determine how to allocate the funds collected by it, however, we determined it was fair to give users that have contributed to that system the power to affect its future.\n\n### Contributors\n\nThe 25% designated for contributors will be allocated to over 100 individuals and organizations that have contributed in significant ways to ENS over the last four years, including the core team at True Names LTD, external contributors, significant integrations, translators, root key holders, and more.\n\nTokens for core contributors and launch advisors will have a four year lock-up and vesting schedule.\n\nThere are no tokens allocated for investors, since there are none.\n\nA portion of the contributors allocation has also been set aside for >450 active participants in the ENS Discord.\n\n### Community Treasury\n\nThe remaining 50% of $ENS tokens is allocated to the DAO. 10% of this allocation will be available to the DAO at launch, with the remaining unlocking over 4 years. This is in addition to the ENS treasury of funds raised from .ETH name registrations that the DAO is expected to receive from the ENS root multisig.\n\nThe DAO is encouraged to allocate these tokens towards community focused initiatives to help the development and growth of ENS, such as grants, hackathons, meetups and more.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nWe’ll be opening the token claim process on November 8.

The core components of ENS are decentralized and self-running (e.g., no one can take away another person’s .ETH name), but there are a few things that require some human discretion. We believe that both ENS and the DAO space have matured enough that now is the time to pass ENS governance over to the community via the creation of a DAO and the $ENS governance token.\n\nSpecifically, we wish to have the ENS root multisig pass over control of the existing ENS treasury, its future funds, and control of the .ETH registrar contract that is in charge of the pricing and registration mechanism for .ETH names. The first order of business for the ENS DAO will be to formally request these from the ENS root multisig key holders.\n\nStarting today, people may nominate themselves as ENS governance delegates. $ENS tokens will be opened for claiming a week from today (snapshot was made yesterday). [Here is more information about the token distribution](https://ens.mirror.xyz/-eaqMv7XPikvXhvjbjzzPNLS4wzcQ8vdOgi9eNXeUuY).\n\n## A Call for Delegates\n\nWe expect ENS governance will evolve over time. Learning from Gitcoin’s governance experience, we believe a delegate model is a good place to start. This helps the DAO represent the interests of members who can’t personally consider and vote on each proposal.\n\nWhile anyone will be welcome to self-delegate and vote independently, we’ll be encouraging token holders to delegate to one of the community leaders who put themselves forward.\n\nIn order for this to happen, we need delegates!\n\nWe need individuals and groups who are dedicated to the growth and longevity of ENS. If you’re interested in taking an active role in ENS governance, now’s your chance.\n\nIf you’re an active member of the ENS ecosystem and want to help direct the future of ENS, [follow this link and submit your application to be a delegate](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-dao-delegate-applications/815).\n\nTime is of the essence: We plan to open the $ENS token claim process one week from today. More details about that will be available then.\n\n**Important note:** You *only* need to submit yourself as a delegate if you want to appear in the list of delegates shown when other people claim their tokens. You do not need to submit a delegate profile if you only want to claim your airdrop, or if you only intend to delegate to yourself! **There will be no POAP issued for delegates.

Its working principle is summarized as \"bond as a service agreement\", which is mainly divided into three parts:\n\nPledge reward\n\nOhm token, which automatically generates income through treasury support currency with inherent value.\n\nTreasury revenue\n\nBonds and LP fees, as Treasury revenue, lock in liquidity and help control ohm supply.\n\nNational debt growth\n\nTreasury fund inflow is used to increase Treasury balance, support outstanding ohm tokens and regulate mortgage apy.\n\nUsers mortgage Dai and other assets, and then they can get ohm at a discount price.\n\nUsers get ohm, can participate in stacking, and then can continue to receive rewards (newly cast ohm will be evenly distributed to stacking participants).\n\nMoreover, the less ohm involved in stacking, the higher apy.\n\nTherefore, if you buy bonds and participate in stacking, you can basically enjoy permanent dividends.\n\nAt present, the TVL of Olympus is US $155 million, and the funds involved in stacking account for 99.5%.\n\nTokemak\n\nTokemak's goal is to become a decentralized market maker.\n\nMarket makers provide liquidity to exchanges, and tokemak is to solve the problem of defi liquidity.\n\nUsers pledge alcx, FXS, TCR, ohm, sushi and other assets on tokemak, and then obtain the corresponding ttoken.\n\nThe highlight of tokemak is to encourage ttoken holders to actively participate in the matching of transaction pairs to earn toke tokens. Therefore, token can be considered as token liquidity.\n\nTokemak runs on a cycle basis. The \"cycle\" is initially set to one week. When a new cycle begins, the assets are deployed. The LP may also request the withdrawal of its assets in the middle of the cycle and may withdraw at the end of the cycle.\n\nAbracadabra\n\n\"This is a spell book that allows users to produce magical Internet money.\"\n\nMagic internet currency (MIM) is a stable currency based on interest bearing assets.\n\nThe difference from the traditional excess mortgage stabilization currency is that abracadabra can mortgage assets that can still obtain sustainable income, such as yvyfi, yvusdt, yvusdc, xsushi, etc.\n\nIn other words, abracadabra's innovation is to make full use of the composability advantage of defi.\n\nconclusion\n\nAlthough these three projects are called defi 2.0, and the single methods are different, they are obviously a good attempt.

{"id": "L7itNjJqsal-o12g2z1jMvwZl8DeppTZQgruSJ_xTBk", "title": "Three years ago, the paper exposed the initial plan of FB metauniverse: it is expected to build and sell 100 million hardware within four years", "body": "。\n\nFocus\n\nIn 2018, oculus executive Jason Rubin wrote a 50 page document called \"metauniverse\" and sent it to Facebook executives and board members.\n\nIn this document, Rubin described in detail Facebook's initial plan to occupy the VR market with a product that can eliminate any competition in the future.\n\nRubin predicts that in ten years, the company will sell 100 million yuan universe hardware, 50% of which are oculus brand or authorized products.\n\nBut Rubin now admits that the meta universe cannot be built in four years, and meta alone cannot succeed. Zuckerberg believes that the meta universe will take 5 to 10 years to become the mainstream.\n\nTencent technology news on October 31, in June 2018, oculus executive Jason Rubin sent an email with the theme of \"the metaverse\" to Facebook board member Marc Andreessen.\n\nIn this 50 page document, Rubin outlined Facebook's strategy of building a metauniverse. He wrote in the first slide: \"we believe that the correct way to break consumers' indifference to virtual reality (VR) is to provide them with what they expect and want, that is, the metauniverse.\"\n\nIn the illustration taken on October 28, 2021, many toy characters appear in front of Facebook's new name meta logo\n\nThis document sent three years ago laid the foundation for meta's future ambition. On Thursday local time, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave a one hour demonstration and finally announced the name of the new company. This presentation aims to depict a virtual world completely different from the real world. Facebook is facing a steady stream of negative news related to the addictive nature of its social media products.\n\nZuckerberg told the audience during the demonstration that the company regards the metauniverse as the next technological frontier where people will live, work and play. But he admits that the meta universe will take five to 10 years to become the mainstream. Just a few days ago, the company announced in its financial report that from the fourth quarter, its hardware department reality labs will become an independent department to release financial results.\n\nThe document Rubin sent to Anderson in 2018 now looks more like the first draft of history. Imagine users floating in a digital world full of virtual advertising, with many virtual goods purchased by people. They will marry virtual people and spend as little time as possible in the so-called \"meatverse\". \"Physical world\" refers to the real world, because people are flesh and blood. Rubin used \"shocking and awe\" 12 times to describe the experience he wanted.\n\nMark Anderson, partner of Andreessen Horowitz, a famous venture capital institution in Silicon Valley\n\nAnderson is one of Rubin's key recipients, not only because he has been a member of Facebook's board of directors since 2008, but also because he has great influence in this specific field. Through Andreessen Horowitz, a famous venture capital institution in Silicon Valley, Anderson is an early investor of oculus. He also invested in roblox, a children's game platform, which focuses on building its own meta universe.\n\nRubin also sent the document to Andrew \"Boz\" Bosworth, head of Facebook's hardware department, and Hugo Barra, vice president of virtual reality department. Bosworth was promoted to CTO in July this year (starting next year). The people who disclosed the document were not authorized to talk about it, but Rubin confirmed its effectiveness in an interview on Friday.\n\nRubin wrote in the title of the first part of the document: \"metauniverse may be the field we will lose.\" he added that Facebook began to consider the concept of metauniverse as a way to attract ordinary consumers, because VR was not widely welcomed.\n\nThe document shows that Facebook spent $2 billion to acquire oculus in 2014. As of June 2018, the company's VR helmets had accumulated 250000 monthly active players. Rubin wrote that although hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in \"early users and pioneers\", these devices have not been welcomed by non hard core players. \"Ordinary consumers are waiting for the day when VR is' fully mature '.\".\n\nRubin wrote: \"we believe that 'full maturity' refers to the metauniverse. Only such a large-scale release can attract the attention of VR skeptics and potential users of VR in the future.\"\n\nRubin's current title at meta is vice president of metauniverse content. He says his document is widely read, but it's not the only one that gets attention. Rubin said on Friday: \"at that time, many people had ideas about the meta universe, and all kinds of documents were full of all kinds of views. I wanted to tell my ideas, which is the way we innovate on Facebook. There were a lot of ideas, a lot of people, and then they were excited. I hope some of them are useful.\"\n\n\"We must act first\"\n\nRubin predicted in the document that the metauniverse project may be completed within four years, and Facebook can complete it alone. But he now realizes that this will take more time, and meta will have to work with a wide range of companies rather than owning and controlling the whole system. \"This is another way for us to expand our thinking. We have to cooperate with others and we have to take many steps because it will take a long time,\" he said\n\nRubin said when writing the document that he was not sure how much time Facebook still had. He only knew that he had to \"find a way out\" and it was very important to stand out in the competition. \"The first meta universe to gain real attraction is likely to be the last. We must first take action to become bigger and stronger, or we may become one of those suitors,\" he wrote\n\nHe also wrote that Facebook could effectively drive competitors such as Google, apple, Sony, HTC and valve out of the VR market. He added that Sony focused on Playstation 5, HTC was dissatisfied with its potential hardware partners, and Facebook invested more than steam's developer valve. \"Google and apple don't exist in VR yet. Daydream is a joke,\" the document said, referring to Google's VR platform, which terminated its operation a year after its release.\n\nRubin was not keen on cooperation. He said in the document that close cooperation with other potential competitors is meaningless, because Facebook should be the place where all users get a virtual experience. Rubin wrote: \"let's not build a metauniverse with plans to help other platforms accumulate and retain consumers. Let's create a metauniverse ourselves to prevent competitors from entering the VR industry in a meaningful way.\"\n\nRubin stressed on Friday that meta has abandoned this approach and the plan is to make the metauniverse interoperable and open, rather than \"limited to one company\".\n\nIn an email statement, a meta spokesman said that technology has been developing since 2018, and the focus at that time was mainly VR. The company said it had always expected competition from Microsoft, Google, apple, Sony, roblox and many other companies. The spokesman also said: \"it is certain that investing in and building the products consumers want is the key to success; we cannot build a meta universe alone; cooperation with developers, creators and experts is very important.\"\n\nPriya's virtual marriage\n\nIn one chapter of the document, Rubin outlines a scenario in which the protagonist is a fictional user named Priya who visits the metauniverse. Priya entered a virtual city with bowling alleys, shops, theatres and Facebook pavilions, which are described as \"the largest building\" and occupy a prominent position in the square almost like a church.\n\nPriya can interact with others and use meta cosmic money to buy a new hairstyle for her avatar. Priya finally met another user who looked like a green, warty ogre. But they finally got married.\n\nRubin wrote: \"Priya can work, eat, socialize and sleep in the metauniverse. Her entertainment time is more and more completed in a virtual way, thanks to the integration of Netflix, Facebook, instagram and other metauniverses.\"\n\nRubin said that under this assumption, in ten years, the company's meta universe hardware sales will reach 100 million, of which 50% are oculus brand or authorized products, and the rest come from other hardware manufacturers.\n\nThe screenshot released on October 28, 2021 shows that Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of meta, announced that Facebook was renamed meta at the virtual and augmented reality conference. The picture shows him fencing with an Olympic gold medal fencer in the metauniverse\n\nIn 20 years, people's time spent on the meta universe can be comparable to \"the time spent watching TV in the 1990s and using Facebook in recent years\". The most important thing for Facebook is that \"after deducting developer expenses, the annual net income will reach billions of dollars\". These revenues will come from the sale of virtual real estate, hats, weapons and status symbols.\n\nFacebook's revenue will also come from advertising, the market the company knows best. Rubin envisaged that Coca Cola would pay for the best location in its exhibition hall, Ford would pay for its virtual car, Procter & Gamble would publicize its brand on digital billboards, gucci could open a virtual store, and Comcast would invest in buying \"a huge billboard that reads' Comcast: make metaspeed function better! '\"\n\nRubin wrote: \"if the meta universe is where people spend their time, it is where the real economy wants to go. Our goal is to bring the meta universe to this stage. In short, it doesn't look like a Facebook product.\"\n\nConsidering this deep immersion, Rubin estimates that the revenue brought by 100 million yuan of cosmic users may be more than that brought by 1 billion Facebook users. \"I may log on to Facebook many times a day, but I will live and work in the meta universe. I may prefer to spend time in the meta universe rather than work day after day,\" he wrote\n\nRubin wrote that to succeed, the metauniverse must be \"frightening\". In other words, it must be bold and ambitious, full of thousands of hours of game experience, and can change people's lives so that Facebook engineers are afraid of the problems they face.\n\nHe wrote: \"if the delivery of the metauniverse we started to build hasn't scared us away, it's not the metauniverse we should build, nor what customers want, so it doesn't make any sense. The rest are mini universes.\"\n\nRubin said that building all this and reaching out to the necessary customer groups requires more than internal resources. He said that Facebook needs a game studio with a team of more than 100 people to make large multiplayer online games.\n\n\"One thing is absolutely clear: no team within Facebook has such cohesion and experience to launch technologically challenging and awesome large-scale games or interactive products and create virtual cities,\" he wrote, referring to Facebook's digital world goal. \"For these reasons, we will need to make acquisitions\".\n\nRubin identified insomniac games and gearbox software as potential targets. Studios like Blizzard and Rockstar are too large, too profitable and too focused on their own game world to be acquired. Rubin finally recommended ready at dawn, the studio of lone echo. Facebook closed the deal in June 2020.\n\nLay the foundation for the future\n\nRubin wrote that in addition to the technical achievements of the meta universe, the release of products will also be crucial and need to \"create deterrence\". If Zuckerberg is not ready for this moment, he should avoid putting a slide with \"welcome to the metauniverse\" behind him when he takes the stage at the conference.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, delivered a speech at the virtual Facebook connect event. The company announced its name change to meta in New York on October 28, 2021\n\nRubin wrote: \"if we reveal every step of our roadmap because we want to complete the theme meeting, the competition will always be one step behind. We don't want to do that. Let's wait until a real metauniverse appears.\" however, Zuckerberg didn't fully follow this suggestion. His speech on Thursday was bold, but his world is far from ready for the consumer experience.\n\nThis demonstration is similar to the animation launched by Pixar, showing the software that the company hopes to develop. It is full of users who stroll and exercise with their own avatars or cartoon avatars. Zuckerberg admitted that this technology still has a long way to go and may take ten years.\n\nSome people believe that Facebook needs to change the topic and distract the public's attention. Previously, many internal documents disclosed by Facebook's whistleblower brought many destructive reports.\n\nRubin has different explanations for this. He said that the company now knows that in order to achieve its arduous mission, it needs to involve others and bid farewell to the tradition of \"walled garden\". \"It's a long journey and we will work with many different companies. In this case, you can't keep secrets for too long,\" he said in an interview", "timestamp": 1635916347, "digest": "dXFDNzBh5cSDeL4IX0lL7LLxU7v9pTD2DUZtCJ2f6Ag", "contributor": "0x981089e9d75994c0495181f55D40C18eb8cd0eAB"}

However, a white paper recently submitted by computer scientists from Stanford University and Ethereum foundation mentioned that there are three attack modes on Ethereum POS chain. This paper describes the problem of proof of interest through evidence.\n\npQLJ4eBzcrSLHArj7c8EFlbbknqjrIqeP4jqBpMj.jpeg\n\nAt this stage, Ethereum network has a proof of work (POW) consensus mechanism. It is expected that in the near future, Ethereum protocol will plan to fully transition to proof of interest (POS) network. Recently, Altair was upgraded in Berlin and London in order to make a smooth transition to the proof of interest network. At the same time, the average cost of destruction per Ethereum exchange also rose sharply, once soaring to $50. Not only that, on Saturday morning, U.S. vertical trends on twitter showed that the word \"eth 2.0\" began to catch fire. Some people discussing eth 2.0 upgrade shared a new white paper written by computer scientists from Stanford University and Ethereum foundation on twitter.\n\nTuur demeester, a bitcoin supporter, shared this article and two sentences quoted in the article on Saturday, which theoretically analyzed how opponents attacked the Ethereum POS chain. The paper entitled \"three attacks on Ethereum's proof of interest\" was published on October 19, Tuur demeester wrote on twitter\n\nReference from eth 2.0 attack paper, from @ kylelogiks:\n\n\"Opponents with 0.09% equity have a 99.6% chance to execute one record on any day\"\n\n\"In the case of adversarial network latency, an attacker can perform 10 reorganizations by controlling only 19 verifiers\" <https://t.co/HGazdB0acV> [pic.twitter.com/MsZoyUGdev](http://pic.twitter.com/MsZoyUGdev)\n\n\\-Tuur demeester (@ Tuur demeester) October 30, 2021\n\nThis white paper was written by Caspar Schwarz Schilling, Joachim neu, barnab é monnot, Aditya asgaonkar, ertem nusret TAs and David TSE. The white paper mainly exposed two recent Ethereum network attacks, and the authors said in the white paper that they had improved the attack technology.\n\nThe improvement of the first two attack technologies will theoretically cause \"short-range reorganization\" and \"adversarial network delay\". In addition, computer scientists have proposed a third way of attack, which they wrote:\n\n\"Combining the first two improved attack methods, we have obtained the third attack method, which is to trigger the reorganization of the remote consensus chain by allowing opponents who have few shares and can not control network message propagation (assuming probabilistic message propagation).\".\n\nMoreover, the white paper also adds to these three attack modes:\n\n\"Honest, rational, or ideologically motivated verifiers can use this attack to increase their profits or delay the agreement, thus threatening the incentive consistency and security of Ethereum pos. in addition, the attack may also lead to congestion of voting processing and instability of consensus.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the white paper said that the attack \"can also make a priori malicious actors completely delay consensus decisions\". At the same time, those who do not support Ethereum network use the paper to emphasize that there may be vulnerabilities related to these attacks when the network is completely transitioned to the proof of interest system. It is worth mentioning that Bram Cohen, founder of Chia project and creator of BitTorrent, also tweeted about the new research on Saturday:\n\nSome questions about the eth2 consensus \"we have obtained the third attack method, which can even cause opponents with very few shares to trigger the reorganization of the remote consensus chain\" <https://t.co/Vz3KG3ai1W>\n\n— Bram Cohen? (@ bramcohen) October 30, 2021\n\nA Chia supporter responded and replied to Bram Cohen:\n\n\"Let's review your tweet in a year and see what Chia has achieved compared with eth. You know, you're rejecting community members like me now.\"\n\nThe Ethereum attack paper does provide a feasible method to attack the Ethereum rights proof blockchain, but it also provides a solution. The authors of the paper believe that these attacks will lure malicious actors.\n\nThe author of this paper, which describes Ethereum's rights and interests and proves that there are three attacks on the blockchain, concludes:\n\n\"Our attack method also enables a priori malicious actors (possibly motivated by ideology) to delay or even completely delay consensus decisions in some cases. In Section 4.2, the improved attack method can provide attackers with tools to do this, even if the attacker cannot control the message propagation delay (on the contrary, it is assumed to be probabilistic).\"", "timestamp": 1635916968, "digest": "AGQPReYBDMntTGFZ35TO8h3SabDC-qPniw3Dcy8QMJU", "contributor": "0x6688E117972d5419D9ae810284A0CcA3A77ea60A"}

{"id": "B547Ey2tpwHAhXNTmsHlgYJWg2h1gnTk95AmY5LUBjA", "title": "算法稳定币专题（中心化稳定币或将被超车）", "body": "在加密世界，加密货币价格波动巨大的特性导致其难以具备现实世界法币的功能，用户需要一个价格稳定的数字货币用于支付和价值储存，在2014年，第一个稳定币USDT诞生了。\n\n \n\nUSDT是法币抵押稳定币，锚定价格为1美元，是目前市值占比最大的稳定币，但它有中心化托管，银行账户不透明的风险。2018年，同为法币抵押稳定币的USDC开始发行，其采用第三方机构对托管银行账户进行监管，并公开财务信息，是加密世界市值排行第二的稳定币。\n\n \n\n但我们发现，上述两个稳定币实质上都是中心化的。基于用户群体对去中心化的要求，加密货币抵押稳定币DAI出现了，其同样锚定1美元，但抵押品不是现实美元资产而是加密货币资产，虽然在前期出现过短暂脱锚的情况，但借助超额抵押机制，DAI总是能回到其锚定价格。\n\n \n\n而后，出于对资金效率的追求，又有一堆天才发明了低抵押甚至完全无抵押的算法稳定币，它们同样采用固定汇率，锚定1美元，但却是通过“算法”（理性经济人的套利行为）来维持价格稳定。初期算稳虽然在纯理性假设下能够不脱锚，但在极端行情下却非常容易进入死亡螺旋，没法持续给予用户信心。而第二代算稳UST和Frax凭借其独特的机制，成为算稳中的两大龙头。\n\n \n\n一，UST————股权协议算稳\n\n算稳UST与公链Terra的原生代币LUNA绑定，锚定价格为1美元。Terra在机制中用LUNA的股权属性作为UST背后的价值支撑。\n\n原理：\n\n当UST市场价格低于1美元时，系统增发LUNA ，回收UST并允许用户用UST换取新增发的LUNA进行套利。例如，当UST市场价格为0.9美元时, 用户可以用1个UST换取价值1美元的LUNA，相当于以比市价便宜0.1美元的价格拿到新增发的1个LUNA。\n\n当UST市场价格高于1美元时，系统增发UST并回收LUNA，用户可以用股权代币 LUNA 换取新增发的UST，例如，当UST市场价格为1.1美元时，用户可以用价值1美元的 LUNA换取一个UST，用户相当于以比市价便宜0.1美元的价格拿到新增发的1个UST。\n\n风险：\n\n当LUNA作为公链代币的共识不够强时，UST在极端行情下有可能会进入死亡螺旋，而LUNA的价值一方面由Terra的生态发展状况决定（Terra的生态越繁荣，投资者对LUNA的信心越强），另一方面由UST及Terra其他稳定币的需求决定（每生成一个Terra稳定币都会销毁等值的LUNA）。\n\nTerra创始团队显然知道这些风险，一方面，他们采用质押锁仓机制让共识较强的LUNA矿工承受在极端行情下的价格波动，另一方面，在不断壮大原生生态的同时，他们努力促成UST与其他公链的合作（例如SOL，COSMOS），推动UST需求的增长。这一系列操作使得LUNA和UST走出了正向飞轮：UST使用的用户数越多，投资者对LUNA的信心越足，而对LUNA的共识越强，用户对UST的稳定性也越有信心。\n\n二，Frax—————双重抵押算稳\n\nFrax背后有USDC和协议股票FXS两种抵押品作为支撑，两种抵押品的比例由协议算法进行调控，例如，可以为30%USDC+70%FXS或50%USDC+50%FXS。\n\n原理：\n\n当Frax的市场价格低于1美元时，用户可以买Frax并在协议中赎回抵押品，并通过卖出FXS获利；当Frax的市场价格高于1美元时，用户可以在协议中放入USDC和FXS铸造Frax并到市场上出售获利。\n\n风险：\n\n因其抵押品中有USDC，其风险仅存在于初期Frax协议抵押品池深度较小的时候（但同样能够通过提高USDC的抵押比例来避免）。不过，随着Frax的发展，项目方后续可能会将抵押品中的USDC换成其他抵押品（ETH，BTC等），到那时又是另一个故事了。\n\n \n\n就在这时，又有一个新问题出现了：随着锚定美元的稳定币不断发展，美元的系统性风险会对加密世界造成极大的影响，这不符合去中心化的概念。为了解决这个问题，非锚定算稳RAI和FLOAT横空出世，这些算稳不锚定美元，采用浮动汇率来换取货币政策的独立性，希望以此为基点，创造一个属于区块链自己的货币体系。\n\n三，RAI------DAI的算稳版本\n\nReflexer继承了DAI的抵押和清算机制：用户将ETH存入SAFE金库，铸造RAI；用户偿还RAI并支付借贷利息，可以赎回ETH。项目方采用的是PID算法控制目标的价格和利息，当前锚定价格为3.14美元。\n\n原理：\n\n当RAI的价格高于目标价格时(此时是3.14美元)，系统采用负利率使赎回价格降低，用户可以以赎回价格铸造新的RAI，并将其卖出换成ETH；当RAI的价格低于目标价格时，系统会提高利率来提高赎回价格，使得借贷成本变高，用户此时倾向于偿还债务。\n\n风险：\n\n与DAI一样，RAI系统的偿付能力将尤为关键，这也是需要用户超额抵押的原因。Reflexer为此同样设定了清算机制：抵押品价值下降到一定阈值时将会触发，并实施抵押品拍卖和债务拍卖。RAI在519期间出现短暂脱锚，但520日即刻拉回，与DAI初期的走势如出一辙，目前已实现价格初步稳定。\n\n四，FLOAT---------“篮子”算稳\n\n与Frax相似，发行FLOAT需要放入两种抵押品：一篮子资产和协议股票BANK。V1版本的篮子仅包括ETH，篮子归协议所有，用户不能用FLOAT换回抵押品。FLOAT通过荷兰式拍卖来调节供求关系，促使市场价格向目标价格回归。当前锚定价格为1.168美元。\n\n注：荷兰式拍卖亦称“减价式拍卖”。拍卖标的竞价由高到低依次递减直到第一个竞买人应价（达到或超过底价）时击槌成交的拍卖。减价式拍卖通常从非常高的价格开始，高得有时没有人竞价，这时，价格就以事先确定的降价阶梯，由高到低递减，直到有竞买人愿意接受为止。如有两个或两个以上竞价人同时应价时，转入增价拍卖形式。在大部分减价式拍卖中，实际上有许多竞价。因为减价式拍卖经常用于拍卖品具有多样品质的场合，如质量上的不同，第一个出价最高的竞买人可以买走全部物品，但往往只以最高价买走这些物品中最好的，然后拍卖继续，价格下降，当另有竞买人愿意接受竞价，他也有同样的选择，也是买走余下中最好的，然后拍卖又继续。在这种情况下，虽然竞买人大部分时间都沉默不语，但是在竞买者之间确实存在持续的竞争。减价拍卖最大的优点在于：成交过程特别迅速，尤其是使用表盘式无声拍卖方式，使拍卖过程机械化、电子化，交易速度大大加快。但是，叫价递减过程往往导致竞买人坐等观望，企盼价格不断减低，因而现场竞争气氛不够热烈\n\n \n\n原理：\n\n当FLOAT市场价格高于目标价格时，协议将从Float的市场价格开始向套利者出售新发行的FLOAT，协议会在FLOAT市场价格和目标价格之间以递减的方式降低报价，直到所有FLOAT都被买走；当FLOAT市场价格低于目标价格时，协议将从FLOAT的市场价格开始反向荷兰式拍卖，从市场中买入FLOAT并销毁，直到买下所有FLOAT。\n\n风险：\n\n与 Frax的USDC和FXS不同，FLOAT的篮子里放入的是ETH，这大概就是上文提到的Frax后续的故事了。没有清算机制和抵押机制的FLOAT能否逃离死亡螺旋，还得经过市场的长时间验证。\n\n五，OHM-------债券算稳？？\n\nOHM由OlympusDAO开发，之所以在OHM后面打上问号，是因为其目前的算法还不完善，Olympus发行的OHM既是算法稳定币，也是其权益代币，通过分析团队目前的运作，我认为他们此举的目的很可能是：前期将OHM作为权益代币对待，放弃稳定币价，并通过质押OHM的高APY激励抓取大量用户获得流量，之后再将OHM作为算法稳定币来对待，逐步让币价稳定下来。\n\n原理：\n\n与FLOAT类似，OHM也设立了一个篮子，篮子由DAI+其他资产组成，其他资产的组成可能是其他加密货币，可能是LP，也可能是其他稳定币（目前包括了LP和Frax）。篮子里每一个OHM都由1美元的DAI支持，但由于其还包含了其他资产，因此OHM的价值会高于1美元，目前锚定价值约为9.27美元。\n\nOHM的价格由债券调控：当OHM市场价格高于锚定价格时，用户可以在市场上用DAI或者OHM-DAI的LP份额购买债券，行权等待期为5天，之后用户可以按照折扣价换取OHM代币并在市场上卖出套利；当OHM价格低于锚定价格时，用户可以在市场上买入OHM，再购买逆向债券，行权等待期为5天，之后用户可以按照一定的溢价卖给篮子。\n\n风险：\n\n1，由于行权等待期，套利用户实际上是存在亏损风险的。团队应该是吸取了第一代算稳死亡螺旋的教训，放弃让用户直接参与铸造套利，而是通过设立行权等待期，把部分风险转移到用户身上，以此来避免OHM进入死亡螺旋。\n\n2，团队在前期为了拉流量，设立了二池:质押OHM，年化复利可达到100000%（系统每8小时复投一次，不收取手续费），风险在于币价崩盘导致亏损。\n\n3，逆向债券功能还未被开发出来。这可能是因为团队预期OHM的价格在初始阶段不会处于水下。逆向债券从其机制上理解，应该是用OHM换取DAI或者OHM-DAI LP。\n\n总结：中心化稳定币或将被超车\n\n稳定币作为链上刚需，竞争是非常激烈的，用户需要稳定币但显然不需要太多的稳定币。虽然USDT凭借其先发优势坐稳龙头位置，但我们不能忽视用户对“去中心化”的硬性要求，ETH创始人Vitalik和波卡创始人Garvin wood也曾多次公开强调了这一点。而对于算稳来说，我们认为在保证去中心化和安全性的基础上，再追求资本效率才是较为理想的方式。\n\n因此，虽然目前USDT和USDC占据了市场，但我们认为它们后续很会被超车的可能性很大。Dai作为第一个去中心化稳定币已经被许多Defi用户所接受，其超额抵押机制保证了安全性，目前市值为66亿，排行第30位；而UST今年与以SOL和COSMOS为首的多个公链进行合作，其市值达到27亿，排行第59位。这两个去中心化稳定币都十分有机会挑战中心化稳定币的位置。\n\n另一方面，RAI和FLOAT虽然仍处于起步阶段，但毫无疑问给了我们一个巨大的想象空间：区块链是否能拥有独立货币政策？拥有独立货币政策的区块链世界可以自定义其生态：从单个拥有完全开放式经济的游戏（像梦幻西游这类传统网游是半开放式经济），到多个拥有完全开放式经济游戏组成的联盟经济体，甚至到链上虚拟国度都有可能实现，再配上VR设备，刀剑神域和头号玩家里的场景已近在眼前。\n\n而对于OHM，其算稳代币与权益代币合一的机制是最大的创新，团队采用这个机制很可能是因为看到了算稳赛道的最大矛盾：币价是否稳定，很大程度上取决于用户数量，但在项目初期，背后若没有多方资本加持，谈何用户数量？这也是RAI和FLOAT目前仍在挣扎的重要原因。\n\nUSDT有先发优势，MakerDAO有强大的社区，Terra有严密的顶层设计，而OHM选择了双币合一：前期通过激励迅速拉来流量，后期则通过庞大的用户基数让OHM走出正向飞轮。而是否能够实现，让我们保持对OlympusDAO的密切关注。", "timestamp": 1635917622, "digest": "ZE3esIxiVBc6n-3O-cQMou8ipgvLpRnhJ7P63-tbdNo", "contributor": "0x455E0e9d8b0c0541F4f26ECeec2Ea54504e9b4C9"}

创业25年，如今63岁的许家印不是没有经历过“至暗时刻”。\n\n2008年1月，许家印创立的恒大集团，以41亿元的价格，拍下广州绢麻场地块。这一价格超过底价8倍，也让绢麻场地块成为当时广州的地王。\n\n2个月后，许家印正式宣布拟上市计划，并开始全球路演。按照当时的股价计算，一旦上市成功，他将成为中国新首富。\n\n摩拳擦掌之际，次贷危机席卷全球，恒大上市计划搁置，陷入债务危机。有媒体为许家印核算了一笔账，当时恒大的负债率，达到了97%。\n\n首富和破产，似乎只是转瞬间的事。\n\n危机时刻，许家印跑到香港，只干一件事——打牌。\n\n牌桌上，对面坐着被誉为“珠宝大王”的香港巨富郑裕彤、华人置业董事长刘銮雄、英皇集团主席杨受成。\n\n3个月后，“牌友们”出面，投资恒大5.06亿美元，缓解许家印的燃眉之急。\n\n2009年11月，危机解除，翻过身来的许家印率领恒大上市成功。当天，恒大成为中国市值最大的民营房地产公司，彼时51岁的许家印也以422亿元的身价，成为内地首富。\n\n转眼12年过去，不知道2021年的这一次危机，许家印是否还有牌可以打。\n\n故事，还是从头讲起。\n\n1958年，许家印出生在河南太康县。他的父亲许贤高是抗战老兵，16岁投身革命，做过抗日部队骑兵连连长。\n\n解放战争时期，许贤高因伤复员，回村务农。新中国成立后，他成为当地仓库的管理员。\n\n许贤高一直到自己36岁那年，才有了儿子许家印。重男轻女的年代，他激动地跑回家，整修半边即将坍塌的房子，不慎受伤，腿部落了残疾。\n\n父亲受伤，还在月子里的母亲下了地。或许是劳累过度，在许家印1岁时，母亲因病去世。许家印成为“半个孤儿”，从此，跟随奶奶生活。\n\n那时他记忆最深的是贫穷，母亲得的是败血病，家中没钱看病，母亲就那么躺在床上，直到生命终结。\n\n许家印的奶奶。是远近闻名的做醋高手。小时候，奶奶做好醋，许家印就带着沿街叫卖。\n\n他常提起奶奶教会他的做人道理，记得最熟的一句话是，“家印啊，咱们穷人最讲诚信。”\n\n那时太康遍地是穷人，没人有钱。想吃醋，就要用红薯干、鸡蛋、麸子来换醋。以物易物，成为许家印的商业启蒙。\n\n贫穷，但许家印没忘记读书。在他的自述里，小学六年，他是在一个没有窗户的茅草房里读完的。他常蹲在一个土台子上，读书写作业。\n\n夏天一下雨，房顶漏下的水，让土台子变成泥巴；冬天，土台子坚硬冰冷，手扶着写作业，常常生冻疮。\n\n他还记得，自己在课本上认识了“我爱北京天安门”几个字，回家读给奶奶听。奶奶的笑容那样灿烂。\n\n关于少年时代，许家印印象最深的是红薯和红薯面做的窝头。\n\n一日三餐，他每顿吃一个红薯和一个窝窝头。窝头冬天难啃难咽，他只能用热水泡开，或者用火烤热。夏天，窝头容易发霉，存放久了长毛，他就洗洗毛，再吃掉。\n\n读中学时需要住校，他背着一箩筐红薯和红薯面做的窝头，带一点盐、葱花、几滴小磨油，每天吃。\n\n成为恒大董事长后的他，常向员工提起自己吃霉窝头的故事。“我那时读书，吃了发霉的窝头闹肚子，你们这代人，真是幸福多了。”\n\n在恒大，人人熟知的故事，却没多少人相信。系爱马仕皮带的老板，谈起曾经的苦难，难免让人觉得有励志夸大的成分。\n\n但那就是赤裸裸的现实\n\n虽出身微寒，但许家印是个读书的好苗子。\n\n他是村里为数不多考到高中的人，他的发小回忆，“那时读书，老师抓得不紧，出好成绩不容易。”\n\n许家印不仅成绩好，他还喜欢画画和摆弄电器。他可以用铁片、铁丝接通废旧的手电筒。他还擅长素描，喜欢在纸上给同学和亲人画画。\n\n给奶奶画的那一幅，被奶奶贴在墙上，很久都没舍得揭。\n\n这份灵气却并未得到认可。那还是“推荐上大学”的时代，1975年，许家印没有成为幸运儿。他高中毕业后，回村里的生产队干了两年农活。\n\n因为文化程度高，他被分配为生产队的拖拉机手。他带着乡亲们，把生产队的苹果，运到县城贩卖。\n\n在村里的两年，他什么活都干活，甚至在生产队里带头掏大粪。人们都说，“这孩子读书读傻了。 \n \n\n但只有他知道，努力争取领导的赏识，是他当时离开泥土地唯一的机会。 \n \n\n1977年，许家印听到了恢复高考的消息。作为曾经的尖子生，他信心满满地报考了清华大学。同村的发小嘲笑他的无知，给他起绰号——许清华。\n\n一边干农活，一边抽空学习，他的第一次高考以失败告终。第二年，他花了很长时间准备考试，小心翼翼地报考了当时并不出名的武汉钢铁学院。\n\n“好歹毕业就是钢铁工人，不会再成为农民了。”\n\n成绩出来之后，他才知道，自己当年的成绩，是整个周口市的第三名。\n\n童年的贫穷，让许家印很早就生出一个强烈的念头，走出去。但多年以后，成为首富的他，却常常回家乡。\n\n他出资为家乡翻修小学，修通了路。2018年，整60岁的许家印，带着妻子再次回乡。看着坑洼的地面、破旧的床板，他说：\n\n“我们从小吃地瓜和地瓜面长大，铺的、盖的、穿的都是补丁摞补丁，现在大伙生活好了，吃的、穿的、住的都越来越好。”\n\n他也提起往事。曾经因为贫穷，村里人看不起他们家，但那次回家，他给村里1000多户村民，每户发了3000元红包。\n\n并决定，捐款6.5亿，用于家乡公益事业，修建医院和学校。\n\n在武汉钢铁学院，许家印印象最深的是学校门口的热干面。\n\n那时他靠国家每个月14元的助学金生活，攒好久的钱，他才可以吃一碗一毛钱的热干面。\n\n一次被老师发现，还被一顿批评。“你是吃助学金的人，怎么能吃这么贵的东西？！”\n\n大学时期，对他帮助最大的是中学老师周然夫妇，得知他生活穷苦，给他寄了20元的生活费。这笔钱，许家印记了大半辈子。\n\n工作后，许家印为老师一家买了一台当时先进的彩色电视机。2018年，他又赠送给老师一套当地的商品房，装修、家电全由许家印出资。\n\n1982年，许家印大学毕业，被分配到河南舞阳钢铁厂，圆了自己的“工人梦”。\n\n作为为数不多的大学生，许家印颇受赏识。车间主任亲自前往车站接他，“当时他带的书挺多的，全是专业书，一股书生味，怪浓的。”\n\n进入钢铁厂，许家印并未在一线工作太久，随即被调任车间主任助理。周围人对这个年轻人的评价出乎预料一致： \n \n\n聪明，好交朋友，干活拼命。\n\n那时他像钢厂里的机器一样，每天早上7点准时到车间，无论刮风下雨。一次外出学习技术，他甚至把所有材料都手抄了一遍，整整大一箱。\n\n凭借过硬的技术和拼命的精神，工作三年后，许家印升任车间主任。他对管理也颇有心得，制定的“生产管理300条”备受领导好评，很快成为整个厂的管理标准。\n\n他关心工人，为了让工人更舒服干活，他把废料收集起来，办了一个洗澡房，工人们下班后，便可免费在房间内洗澡。\n\n短短几年，他的车间成为了整个厂工作效率最高的车间，他也有了新的外号“小皇帝”。\n\n这个外号，包含着许家印在这个300多人大车间中的权威。\n\n但他没想到的是，在车间主任的位置上，他一坐就是整整7年。他自认没有关系、没有背景，很难继续被提拔，前途越来越渺茫。\n\n更让他绝望的是，当时，因为上交客户送来的1500元红包，他被记过处分。而自己岳父卧病在床，他却拿不出钱救助\n\n曾经梦寐以求的“工人生活”，让他越来越感到迷茫。\n\n一天在报纸上，他看到深圳成立特区的消息。正值下海浪潮席卷全国，许家印决定离开河南那个小小的钢铁厂，奔赴汪洋大海。\n\n“四面都是山，一直有离开出去闯荡的想法。”\n\n1992年，带着所有的积蓄2万元和30多页简历，他远走深圳。为此，他和妻子、岳父母分居。他答应他们，会给一家人更好的生活。\n\n在深圳，足足有半个月，许家印投出去的简历杳无音讯。那一年，他34岁，坐在繁忙的深圳街头，不知流了多少眼泪。\n\n“那时候真是痛不欲生，工作10年，我每一件事都做得很漂亮，如今混成这样，这叫什么事？”\n\n直到，一家贸易公司收留了他。他从一个处级干部，变成了一个贸易公司的小业务员，每月工资500元。\n\n重新进入一个新行业，他将自己的姿态降到最低，见谁都喊“师傅”。因为业务不熟，他见过太多难看的脸色。但为了生活，他必须咬牙坚持下去。\n\n在贸易公司，许家印唯一能做的，就是加倍工作。\n\n为了省钱，他在公司和朋友家的走廊睡了三个月，几乎把所有精力都放在了工作上。他认真周到地对待每一个客户，珍惜每一个谈判机会。\n\n幸运找到了他，当时经朋友介绍，他谈成了一笔10万元的合作。在90年代这是一笔天文数字，这件事，也让他被提拔为办公室主任。\n\n此后，许家印的能力找到了合适的舞台。干了一年后，他向老板提出成立合资公司的想法，希望能和前东家舞阳钢铁厂合作，老板爽快答应。\n\n这时，许家印从业务员，变成了时髦的“总经理”。\n\n那是许家印第一次创业。原本精于业务的他，发现仅仅会业务，是做不成事的。\n\n他开始施展自己的公关技巧。他极擅长应酬，酒场如战场，他能妥帖照顾到每一个人，给足面子，又拿到自己想要的条件。\n\n很多合作伙伴评价他，“说服能力之强，足以令风云变色。”\n\n甚至，有一次他跟一位银行行长说，希望把自己系到对方的鞋带上，“您去哪我就跟着去哪，不能浪费一个晚上。”\n\n多年以后，他和苏宁老板张近东一张喝交杯酒的照片，传遍网络。\n\n遗憾的是，第一次创业的许家印还是失败了，尽管他拿到了2000万银行的贷款。\n\n他也明白了一个道理——仅有应酬是远远不够的。做生意不全是人情，做生意，要盈利。\n\n1994年，许家印被公司派到长春分公司做分部总经理，他拒绝了。\n\n那时，万通六君子海南淘金的故事，已经传遍全国。在海南那片热土上，他们依靠房地产业务，闪转腾挪，赚到将近8个亿的资金。\n\n在许家印工作的深圳，王石创办的万科也早已上市，成为下海浪潮中耀眼的弄潮儿。富力集团的李思廉，以2000万资金进入广州房地产市场，发展迅速，书写了不小的神话……\n\n一个个崭新的财富故事面前，许家印野心勃勃。\n\n而那时，尽管已经做到了公司高管的位置，工资在几年间翻了6倍，但他仍然觉得“付出没有得到匹配的回报”。\n\n他希望到当时贸易更加兴盛的广州，从事房地产项目。\n\n果不其然，命运被他赌对了。来到广州的第一年，他收购了一块当时没人看好的地块，并对土地进行充分的包装。\n\n设计阶段，他力排众议，推出当时罕见的小户型房，结果一炮而红，几百套房子被抢购一空，也打响了许家印的名号。\n\n一个讲求效率的名号——当年开工，当年销售，当年销罄。\n\n而就在项目二期即将开售的时候，许家印却提了辞职。像第一次辞职一样，很多人劝他珍惜机会，他却说：\n\n“人是有价值的，什么样的人、什么样的水平、什么样的贡献，就一定要有什么样的待遇。不然，从管理上来说，是留不住人的。”\n\n当时，即便做到公司高管，他每个月的收入不足3000元。外人看来那是一个不低的工资，但他却希望有更好的生活。\n\n“假如一个年给我10万或20万，自己可能就不会去想创业了。因为创业有风险，也很艰难。但3000多元的工资养家都困难，怎么继续干下去？”\n\n1996年，在广州，广州恒大实业集团有限公司正式成立，当时38岁的许家印成了老板。\n\n历经近20年坎坷，这个从河南农村走出来的少年，敢于拼命的少年、受尽生活折磨的少年，开启了属于自己的时代。\n\n很多人看来，创业是开启自己时代的标志，但许家印明白，自己没有退路。\n\n缺少启动资金，缺少商业项目，一切难上加难。但许家印长袖善舞。当年年底，他拿到600万元的银行贷款，顺利买下广州工业大道的一块住宅用地。开始书写自己的神话。\n\n工业大道住宅地的旧址，是原广州农药厂，当时没有开发商愿意投资。许家印接手后，第一项措施就是将原本的土地下挖三尺，运来健康安全的土重新填埋。\n\n轰鸣的工地和卡车来来往往，全城的老百姓都可以看到。这一措施，成为了恒大第一个金字广告。\n\n随后，更绝的是，当时因为资金紧张。他想到的唯一方法不是压价，而是“压付款方式”。“因为我当时没钱的嘛，只有靠分期付款解决运营问题。”\n\n销售端，他的房子不降价，但可以分期付款。成本端，他以分期的方式支付劳务和采购。当时房子要盖到三分之二才可以卖楼，许家印冒着风险，房子从盖到第一层就发售。\n\n

抵押/稳定币/抵押借贷生息/\n\n### 项目发起人： Daniele\n\n​\n\n**Abracadabra 是一个著名的「咒文」，因为「魔语」在进行魔术表演时使用，这也是 Abracadabra 的治理代币是 SPELL（咒语）。**\n\n**​代币模型**\n\n## Abracadabra一个相对比较社区化的项目，代币更多是通过公平分发的方式流通，通过 IDO 方式分发的代币也就占比 7%。\n\n**不像其他项目各种资本领投，站台，天使，早年等利益分配。spell 分配简单。**\n\n**​**\n\n**SPELL**代币的分配如下：\n\n* **7%** ——IDO\n* **18%** — SushiSwap ETH-SPELL LP 代币\n* **45%** — MIM-3LP3CRV LP 代币\n* **30%** — 团队分配\n\n**代币分配**\n\nSPELL 的最大供应量为 2100 亿个，7% 通过 IDO 发行，团队分配 30%，其余通过流动性挖矿分发，分别是 18% 至 SushiSwap ETH-SPELL LP （促进 SPELL 和其他代币之间的交易），45% 至 MIM-3LP3CRV LP （促进 MIM 与三大美元稳定币的交易）。\n\n### 双代币模型\n\nAbracadabra 也分为治理代币 SPELL 和锚定美元的稳定币 MIM。\n\nSPELL 作为治理代币，主要是用来调整协议的整体参数的，就像 MKR 持有者需要按需为协议的新增资产、资产发行上限、抵押率等参数进行投票。而且 Abracadabra 的用户在借贷时需要付出一部分手续费，这部分收入最终也会通过回购或者各种形式分配给 SPELL 持有者。\n\nSPELL 的最大供应量为 2100 亿个，7% 通过 IDO 发行，团队分配 30%，其余通过流动性挖矿分发，分别是 18% 至 SushiSwap ETH-SPELL LP （促进 SPELL 和其他代币之间的交易），45% 至 MIM-3LP3CRV LP （促进 MIM 与三大美元稳定币的交易）。\n\n而「神奇的互联网货币」（MIM）则是一种锚定美元价值的稳定币，毕竟目前 DeFi 世界中锚定美元的稳定币市场更大，并且更方便与其他稳定币交易协议进行组合，流动性更佳。目前 MIM 的流通超20 亿美元。\n\n​\n\n**SPELL**是最大供应量2100亿的Abracadabra魔法令牌。目前在多链上线。\n\n在以太坊上线，SPELL 合约为：**0x090185f2135308BaD17527004364eBcC2D37e5F6**\n\n​\n\n**SPELL 有什么作用？**\n\n**SPELL 代**币的主要功能是将其**质押**在**Abracadabra 中**以获得**sSPELL**代币，这有几个好处。\n\n* 首先，他们授予持有人**投票权**来更改平台参数，例如 TVL、清算费用、未来抵押品期权等。\n* 其次，他们授予持有人对协议产生的**费用**的索赔。\n\n协议费用仅来自借用 MIM 的**利息**。由于债务是在 MIM 中支付的，因此会收取费用。它们分布如下：\n\n* **75%用于购买发给 sSPELL 代币**持有者的SPELL 代币。\n* **20%分配给治理金库，用于激励**MIM 流动性池。\n* **5%被重定向到多重签名库，当市场条件需要**干预时将使用该库。\n\n​代币市场情况\n\n## MIM市值：24亿左右\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s5kSM8xSFRMyICi2GsG-b.png?height=618&width=1804)\n\n##

是一个可以抵押**“生息债券”**来铸造**对 USD 锚定的稳定币\\*\\*（MIM）。\n\n大白话：**基于生息资产的稳定币协议**，就是在投资人在defi投资于yearn等这类的有息资产在拿出来抵押铸造锚定美元的稳定币。\n\n主要允许允许用户抵押他们的有息代币（ibToken）并以它们为抵押进行借贷。这个系统引入了两个新的主代币：\n\n* $MIM -协议可铸造的稳定币，每个 MIM 被设计为代表被抵押的 ibToken 中的 1 美元。\n* $SPELL - Abracadabra 生态系统的治理代币。它还被用作系统内主要的流动性挖矿补贴。\n\n\\*\\*项目最大的特色之一：释放了在其他平台抵押资产的流动性。\\*\\*例如用户在 yVaults 种锁定的资产是没有办法在取出之前使用的，也就是被限制了流动性，同时，用户会获得对应的生息证券 yTokens。但是 Abracadabra 允许用户抵押 yTokens 来借出稳定 MIM，释放了抵押物的流动性，大大加速了资产的流转。\n\n基于智能合约实现的链上稳定币协议，一般是通过超额抵押某类资产（比如 ETH），以铸造出锚定美元价值的稳定币（比如 DAI）。Abracadabra 也是同样的方式，**只不过将原本的超额抵押资产，换成了可以获得持续收入的资产**，很好地利用了 DeFi 的可组合性优势。\n\n除了部署在以太坊之外，还通过与 L2 和侧链的集成，进一步降低用户参与协议的成本。\n\nAbracadabra 也很快部署在了 BSC、Avalanche 和 Fantom 这三个侧链中，并且也第一时间支持了以太坊 L2 网络 Arbitrum One\n\n​\n\n模式简单，但很精彩。像 xSushi 这样的有息代币进去，然后被称为 MIM 美元的神奇互联网货币就会出来。把你的代币存入，你就会得到一个稳定币，以后你可以用 USDC 或 DAI 来交换，并随心所欲地使用它们。\n\n人们用他们的加密货币质押，以获得有利息的代币（xSushi, yvUSDC）的利息。这些代币，在 Abracadabra Money 上，可以作为质押品，从而为你赚钱，同时允许你借到它的价值的 90%。因此，它提高了你的资本效率。由于质押是生产性资产，可以说，你的质押品实际上是帮助你偿还债务。\n\n在 DeFi 2.0 中，你会听到越来越多的“自我偿还贷款”。他们的原生代币叫做 SPELL，是用来激励用户的。投入它，你会得到 sSPELL 的收入分成和投票权。\n\n## 资产的单独清算机制\n\n**项目的另一特色----资产的单独清算机制。由于 Abracadabra 使用的是 Kashi Lending Technology，这就**支持每个 MiM 都有一个确定的 ibTKN 来作为担保。也就是说，在 Abracadabra 种，每种抵押物头寸（CDP）都是独立的，只有自己的清算风险，而不像绝大多数项目一样，用户的所有抵押物都可能被一个清算事件清算掉。我们举个例子来说明下：\n\n假设钻石王老五有一些 yvWETH 和 yvDai (yearn 产生的生息债券，也就是本文所说的 ibTKN)，目前 yvWETH 的单价是 2000 美元。钻石王老五发现了 Abracadabra 这个神奇的项目，于是他把手上本来较难流通的 yvWETH 抵押到协议中，并且选择贷出最大额度的 MIM 供他使用。同时，他也把手头的 yvDai 抵押到了协议中，也借出了一定数额的 MiM。此时，他的 yvWETH 抵押物清算阈值是 1696.69 美元。\n\n同时，钻石王老六也一直在参与这个项目，并且作为清算者，他有一套自己的程序来监视这两个个 CDP 准备随时清算它。\n\n过了一段时间，yvWETH 价格非常不幸的跌落到 1696.69 以下，而 yvDai 却没有跌到对应的清算阈值下。钻石王老六的程序就会对钻石王老五的 yvWETH 抵押物头寸进行清算，偿还掉这个抵押物头寸对应的 MiM, 并且拥有了这些 yvWETH。而钻石王老五的 yvDai 头寸也不会被清算，同时他也不用去还 yvWETH 借出来的这部分 MiM。\n\n通过上面的例子我们可以看出，**Abracadabra 本身是个具有创新精神的项目**。\n\n运行机制\n\n首先，让我们概述一下协议的基本运行情况。如果你已经知道 Abracadabra 是如何工作的，你可以跳到关于激励机制的相关介绍。\n\n​\n\n​\n\n### 借款人\n\n首先，让我们从借款人的角度来了解这些步骤：\n\n* 借款人存款合格的 ibToken 抵押品\n* 借款人以资产抵押参数确定的固定利率铸造 $MIM 来代表其借款价值\n\n清算参数也由资产决定，他们假设 1 $MIM = 1 USD （USD Chainlink 价格预言机）\n\n* 借款人通过 Curve $MIM/ 稳定币池用 $MIM 交易其他更普遍接受的稳定币\n\n依靠 Curve 池的流动性来支持交易\n\n* 借款人在整个 DeFi 期间根据需要使用稳定币，监控 Abracadabra 的清算风险\n* 为了准备偿还贷款，借款人将稳定币交换为 $MIM\n\n依靠 Curve 池仍然有足够的流动性来支持交易\n\n为了不产生额外的不可预见的费用 / 损失，在从 $MIM 到稳定币的交换中，借款人依赖于 $MIM/ 稳定币的价格与之前大致相等或更便宜\n\n* 借款人在步骤 2 中返回 $MIM 债务+铸币利息。\n\n从借款人的角度来看，只要 Curve 池保持 MIM 的稳定 / 锚定和流动性，这个系统就能很好地工作。是的，交易的时候会产生一笔额外的临时费用，这应该被考虑进去。\n\n**借款人的一般价值交换：**\n\n* 为获得流动性担保 / 借款支付利息\n\n**借款人的好处：**\n\n* 稳定，利率相对较低\n* 在保持主要 ibToken 敞口的同时具有动态的担保 / 借贷能力\n\n**借款人的担忧：**\n\n* 因抵押品价值下降而被清算\n* $MIM Curve 池的剩余流动性\n* $MIM 保持锚定（或至少在回购 $MIM 时更便宜）\n* 导致抵押品损失的系统性漏洞 / 黑客攻击（尽管损失仅限于抵押品价值和借款价值之间的差额）\n\n### ​\n\n### Curve LP （MIM-3CRV LP）\n\n很明显，借款人关注的很大一部分是 Curve 池和 $MIM 定价，所以让我们来研究一下如何激励 Curve 的流动性提供者（LP）参与进来。\n\n* Curve LP 存入一个合格的稳定币（$DAI， $USDC， $USDT， $MIM），并接收 MIM- 3LP3CRV -f LP 代币（后面称为 MIM- 3CRV）\n\n存款人在技术上可以接收不同数量的 MIM- 3CRV 代币，这取决于池中每个代币的余额\n\n依赖于 $MIM 没有经历无限铸币\n\n如果提现或者任何池子中的代币脱锚后蒙受损失\n\n* MIM-3CRV LP 通过在 Abracadabra 上 staking MIM-3CRV，从 faming/ 流动性挖矿项目获得 $SPELL 补贴\n* 在任何时候，MIM-3CRV LP 都可以选择解除 staking，将流动性移除到所选择的稳定币中\n* 在任何时候，MIM-3CRV LP 都可以选择卖出、staking 或做二池的 LP （但请记住，他们从未购买 $SPELL，所以这是通胀 / 隐性的卖出压力）\n\n注意，池中的代币余额非常重要。如果其中任何一个代币发生价格倾斜，那么单个稳定币的价格和 MIM – 3CRV 池子份额代币的价格也会发生倾斜。\n\n**MIM-3CRV LP 的一般价值交换：**\n\n* 提供稳定的代币流动性，以换取 $SPELL 收益\n\n**MIM-3CRV LP 的优势：**\n\n* 交易费用提取\n* 高 $SPELL 年化\n\n**MIM-3CRV LP 的担忧：**\n\n* $MIM 无限铸币耗尽所有 MIM- 3RV LP 的价值\n* 进入 / 退出时，稳定币代币余额发生倾斜\n* 不在其他有可能更高收益的协议上进行 farming 的机会成本\n* 系统利用 / 黑客攻击\n\n最后一点对 MIM-3CRV LP 来说是至关重要的，因为稳定币 LP 通常被认为是收益的雇佣兵。如果他们能在其他方案中找到更好的风险 / 回报，他们几乎肯定会转移到那里。\n\n### 利润流\n\n从借款人那里提取的固定利息将有几个不同的去处。\n\n* 70% 的利润用于回购 $SPELL，并分发给 $sSPELL 的持有者（更多关于他们在下一节）\n* 20% 的利润被用作财政部持有的激励措施，并由治理社区进行管理\n\n这些激励的时机和资产类型将在未来的提案中待定\n\n* 利息的 5% 归 DAO 管理的安全基金\n\n### $SPELL 持有者（$SPELL Stakers）\n\n最后，我们来看看那些对 Abracadabra 的治理代币 $SPELL 有投机兴趣的人。首先，让我们看看那些 staking $SPELL 并从协议中抽取费用的人：\n\n* staker 持有 $SPELL （从市场购买或产量种植中获得）并获得 $sSPELL\n* 通过从借款人提取利息，staker 的 $sSPELL 积累了更多潜在的 $SPELL\n* 在任何时候，staker 可以解除 staking 并出售部分或全部 $SPELL\n\n**staker 的一般价值交换：**\n\n* staking $SPELL （系统 4 没有已知的好处），并获得更多潜在的 $SPELL\n\n**staker 的好处：**\n\n* 获得 $SPELL faming 的年化\n\n**staker 的担忧：**\n\n* $SPELL 价格下行\n* 高通货膨胀（会导致价格下跌）\n* 在其它项目上寻找更好的风险 / 回报\n* 系统利用 / 黑客攻击\n* 激励机制\n\n  项目很大程度上依赖于它的 $MIM 稳定币来保持一切顺利运行。\n\n  ### $MIM 的魅力\n\n  在目前发行和实施的时刻，我知道除了 MIM- 3CRV 池之外，没有什么真正的地方可以进行 $MIM 的铸币——通过交易和 LP 充值。但要保持系统的健康，$MIM 的余额不能与其他稳定货币偏离太多，也不能与美元脱钩（在本例中是低于 1 美元）。因此，为了支持 $MIM 的价格，需要鼓励其他非 $MIM 的稳定币存入到协议中。这就是 MIM-3CRV 资金池的流动性挖矿 /Yield Farming 来填补缺口的原因。\n\n  仍有一些潜在因素可以帮助支撑 $MIM 的价格，主要是当 $MIM 低于 1 美元时，未偿 $MIM 债务的投资者有机会折价偿还债务。然而，为了适当地激励他们偿还债务，稳定币脱锚的价差可能会比较大。毕竟，这些借款人可能正在其它地方使用杠杆，他们不想放弃绝佳的入场时机！这个过程是不利于那些想要建立新的债务仓位的人的，请注意，他们必须支付额外的费用，从而将 $MIM 转换为更广泛接受的稳定币。\n\n  ### 稳定币\n\n  在这场决斗中，稳定币 ibToken 借方（下文简称 s 借方）相较于 MIM – 3CRV LP 具有显著优势，尽管它们从根本上都是稳定币。这其中有三个原因：\n  * 借款人只是从一个更稳定的领域之外的领域获取收益（涉及所有可互操作的 DeFi 的 ytoken 允许更高的收益深度）\n  * 借款人有能力来模仿 MIM- 3CRV LP 的执的步骤（将 MIM 存入 MIM- 3CRV 池，并在那里收到累加的收益率）\n  * 借款人可以多任务处理他们的收益-收益从自他们的原始本金，同时可以帮助他们了解到如何使用的额外流动性（从 ibToken 赚取基本收益，并使用借来的资产作为期望在其他地方赚取）\n\n  由于上述借款人拥有独特的收益机会，MIM- 3CRV LP 经常被吸引并转换为借款人。为了保持收益率平衡并防止显著的转化率，MIM- 3CRV LP 要求补贴的收益率金额显著高于借款人可以从其他项目中通过本金获得的收益率。\n\n  ### $SPELL\n\n  $sSPELL 持有者和二池 LP 的对决更多是基于风险 / 敞口偏好，但风险影响的因素更多。\n\n  sSPELL 持有者的本金完全依赖于 $SPELL 的价值，他们的收益完全依赖于借款人支付给他们的利息。当有大量借款时，它们的收益率很高，反之亦然。\n\n  二池 LP 的本金同时投资于 $SPELL 和 $ETH，但两者的价值都只占一半。他们的收益来自于系统给他们补贴的 $SPELL。还有一部分来自于交易费用。当 $SPELL 价值下降时，从技术上讲，他们比 $sSPELL 持有者损失的本金更少。然而，二池 LP 可能会因为恐惧而完全离开协议。\n\n  因此，在这个子系统中，二池 LP 通常需要比 $sSPELL 持有者收获的利息收益更多的收益补贴。如果借款上升，$sSPELL 持有者的利息就会上升，二池 LP 的收益也会增加（希望是 $SPELL 价值增加，但不情愿的是增加代币补贴）。\n* 总结\n\n  SPELL 是最近 DeFi2.0 的代表协议，SPELL 作出的创新是增加抵押品的资本效率，项目方对标 MakerDAO。跟 MakerDAO 不同的是，Abracadabrao 抵押的资产是带有收益的资产，这样对于抵押资产的用户来说，相当于提高了资金的效率。因为这些抵押资产本身还在获得收益。这些带有收益率的资产包括 yvYFI、yvUSDT、yvUSDC、xSushi 等。超额抵押这一类资产可以生成其稳定币 MIM。首先是创新的使用有息资产代币进行抵押，其次是代币质押者可以获取协议费用分红，再者是多链部署，同时进行流动性激励。\n\n  **而优秀的defi协议最终回归资产的流动性与资本效率的提升**\n\n  DeFi 之所以能成为 DeFi，除了以太坊等底层公链基础设施之外，最重要的是有流动性的提供。这是 DeFi 能够运行的前提，是支撑其生命的血液。这也是为什么 2020 年夏天，在 Compound 推出流动性挖矿之后，引爆了整个市场的重要原因。\n\n  随着一年多实践展开，人们看到了流动性挖矿的弊端，短期的激励模型只会鼓励流动性提供者短期的行为。增发代币进入流动性提供者手中，不少情况下，流动性提供者并没有跟协议形成长期的互利合作关系。流动性提供者随时可以撤退，并留给协议一地鸡毛。\n\n  ### DeFi2.0 通过新的机制改变了协议和流动性提供者之间的关系，并最终重构了流动性服务本身。\n\n  那么Abracadabra的优势机亮点大概可以总结行为：\n\n  1\\.创新性的设置极大提高了资产的使用效率，使资产流动性大幅提升。\n\n  2\\.优秀的团队执行能力，最近盯上了btc与doge等资产，那么有望进一步提升mim的市值与使用场景，带来更多的协议收入。\n\n  3\\.\n\n  ​", "timestamp": 1635922440, "digest":

"![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/L93NoPEWJGaj524WGj5wD.png?height=900&width=1800)\n\neverPay\\[1\\] 是 everFinance 旗下的区块链实时支付协议。everPay 会将其他公链上的加密资产锁定在智能合约中，并将其映射到协议中为用户提供实时的支付结算。everPay 交易成本非常低，1美金可以进行百万笔交易。此外，everPay 使用存储共识范式打造，没有区块链的性能限制问题，协议的 TPS 大小取决于应用架构和服务器性能，具备和传统互联网应用媲美的 TPS 性能。\n\n在传统法币领域有 stripe\\[2\\] 提供法币支付服务，区块链领域则可以使用 everPay 进行代币支付。everPay 协议具备区块链的重要特性：透明、不可篡改、去信任化等。在协议中，任何人都可以成为协议的检测者，观察系统中的账本变化。同时，我们也为 everPay 提供浏览器，任何用户都可以访问浏览器查看 everPay 的账本，并确保 everPay 中锁定代币资产和流通资产始终保持 1:1 的映射关系。\n\n# 存储共识范式\n\n存储共识范式（Storage-based Consensus Paradigm\\[3\\]\\[4\\]，简称 SCP）是 everFinance 提出的下一代区块链应用开发范式。在 Ethereum 模型中，计算会被区块链网络中的所有节点执行，所有节点都会生成和存储全局状态以供查询。不同于 Ethereum 模型，SCP 分离了计算和存储，区块链不进行任何计算仅进行数据存储，所有计算由链下的客户端/服务器执行，生成的状态也由链下客户端/服务器进行保存。\n\nSCP 使用了链下智能合约，智能合约可以使用任何的语言进行编写，这些程序的所有输入参数都来自存储型区块链。在范式中，区块链更像是计算机的硬盘，链下智能合约可以在任何具备计算能力的机器上进行。使用区块链作为硬盘，所存储的数据具备了不可篡改和可追溯的特性，区块链为数据赋予了可信的特性。此时，链下智能合约对可信数据进行计算，能保证状态的最终一致性。\n\n使用 SCP 开发的应用程序具备区块链的透明和可信特性，同时又具备传统互联网应用的高性能和可用性。SCP 具备以下优势：\n\n![SCP 的优势](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AitKo81WPZWFrgcW5eymB.png?height=900&width=1800)\n\n1. 可组合性：传统金融服务间进行业务对接，需要会计对账，对账过程繁复且容易出错。采用 SCP，将金融交易记录完全上链，把传统金融服务转化成区块链应用，实现自动化对账，达到应用间的快速协同，高效组合。\n2. 开发门槛低：使用 Ethereum 虚拟机编写智能合约需要使用 Solidity 语言，链下智能合约则可以用任何的语言进行开发，开发者可以将传统的应用转化成区块链应用。\n3. 无性能限制：链下计算，其性能跟传统应用一样，链下服务器可以承载大量的交易。TPS 取决于提供计算服务的机器性能和构建应用的技术架构。\n4. 共识成本极低：100 万笔交易仅需要 1 美金。\n\nSCP 的灵感来自于 Arweave 的智能合约 SmartWeave 以及 Ethereum 二层扩容方案 Rollup，对 SmartWeave 和 Rollup 的可用性进行了改良。\n\n### 改良 SmartWeave\n\n> SmartWeave 是建立在 Arweave 上的智能合约平台。让用户和开发者可以构建应用程序，程序的执行具备可信和去中心化特性。SmartWeave 的重要特性是“惰性计算”，它将智能合约的计算过程从节点中移除，转交给用户进行处理。这意味着，合约代码的计算过程不会在区块链网络中进行，所有的计算过程和状态都在请求它们的机器上进行本地计算和存储。\n\nSmartWeave\\[5\\] 是一个完全开放性、去中心化的合约平台，链下计算具备更强的扩展性但也引发了新的问题。SmartWeave 容易受到数据 DDOS，大量无效数据通过 Arweave 传输到所有的计算节点上，导致节点的共识延迟和不可用。进行数据 DDOS 攻击时，攻击者可以恶意的发送大量的错误交易到链上，客户端需要先下载这些交易才能进行验证，大量错误交易占用了客户端的带宽，导致正常交易被淹没在错误交易中。数据 DDOS 达到一定的程度时，会导致客户端状态计算延迟。\n\n为了解决数据 DDOS 问题、保障应用的可用性，everFinance 提出协调者（Coordinator）的角色。应用的所有数据由协调者进行首次计算和验证，计算和验证通过后，这些数据再由协调者批量打包到 Arweave 上。协调者就像是以 Ethereum 上 Rollup 的运营商，同 Rollup 一样，它们都是批量的把一批交易打包到链上，而且这些打包的数据都可以被验证。SmartWeave 的“惰性计算”保证了可验证性，Rollup 保障了数据的正确性并避免了数据 DDOS 攻击。\n\n# 技术架构\n\neverPay 协议通过 DAO 进行运作，完全透明和 100% 可验证。DAO 的数据共享和计算都使用了 SCP。DAO 中共有三类成员角色，分别是：协调者（Coordinator），检查者（Detectors）和守望者（Watchmen）。另外有一个独立的组件 ProposalHub：用于采集 DAO 的提案和签名，聚合并执行提案。\n\n协议中，所有角色都集成了相同的链下智能合约代码，每个角色都具备一致的业务规则。角色之间的合约程序没有独立的数据通讯，数据通信和下载完全使用了 Arweave。合约程序会连接 Arweave 进行数据下载，交易的顺序以 Arweave 上存储的顺序为准。合约程序获得交易数据后，在链下智能合约中进行计算，生成具备一致性的最终状态。\n\n![everPay 如何工作](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9RO9Iivl7TUqwI-Ib7Wap.png?height=900&width=1800)\n\n### 协调者（Coordinator）\n\n负责交易验证和上链。协调者使用单笔实时验证，延时批量上链模式。用户的交易发送到协调者时，服务器会进行实时的计算和验证，更新服务器余额到最新状态。协调者是高可用的后端服务程序，确保交易的顺序和正确性，在数分钟内，协调者将这段时间内的一批交易按照时间的先后顺序打包到区块链上。\n\n协调者只有验证和上链的功能，无法对 DAO  账本进行攻击。原因是协议中的所有角色都会对账本进行独立验证，共识的形成并不由协调者决定，而是链下智能合约程序与可信的数据产生。在 everPay 协议中，共识不会被协议中的任何角色影响，SCP 保证了共识的客观性。协调者是 DAO 里的一个会计角色，进行账本的撰写，不会接触到实际资产。资产的调度由守望者进行，详见“守望者”小节。\n\n为了保障用户体验和交易的实时性，协调者目前是一个独立节点。协调者可以在交易排序时进行审核，审核时间窗口是短暂的，从交易采集到批量上链只有 10 分钟左右的时间。协调者单节点产生的内容审核和交易排序的风险，会在代币发行后引入质押和惩罚进行规避。\n\n### 检测者（Detectors）\n\neverPay 协议的链下智能合约代码会开源，合约代码可以在任何人的机器上运行并且计算 everPay 交易。\n\n任何人都可以下载链下智能合约代码成为系统中的检测者，该程序会自动加载 Arweave 上的交易数据，自动计算和验证这些交易。当程序同步到最新 Arweave 区块后，检测者可以获得应用的最终状态。检测者们运行了同一套 everPay 协议代码，同时他们的数据来源是不可篡改、可追溯的链上数据，让每一个检测者运行的最终状态都具备一致性。\n\n### 守望者（Watchmen）\n\n守望者是 everPay 协议中的多签治理成员，在 DAO 中，守望者这个角色非常重要，它需要生成提案和签署提案，提案只有获得了大多数（大于51%）守望者的签署后才能执行。\n\n协议的最终安全性是由 SCP 的客观性以及 Arweave 网络进行保证的，守望者承担了跨链资产锁定的安全职能。守望者生成提案要按照链下智能合约代码进行处理，提案的生成和签署都是自动化的。由于链下智能合约和链上可信数据生成的最终状态唯一，如果有守望者提交了非法的提案，协议也可以自动检测并进行应急处理。\n\n守望者保障了多签治理运行的合法性。 计算的共识安全性由 Arweave 永久存储进行保证，因此即使在守望者较少的情况下，应用也具备较强的共识。和同矿工升级 Ethereum 节点需要获得矿工的认可一样，当链下智能合约提出修改时守望者需要认可升级的程序，并适配新的提案生成流程。\n\n### ProposalHub\n\nHub 用于采集守望者的签名提案，进行提案执行。此功能不是必须的，创建 Hub 是为了更高效的收集和执行签名。\n\n# 账户体系\n\neverPay 协议的账户体系非常灵活，可以支持多种链的账户体系。\n\n目前已经支持的链地址默认就是 everPay 的账户 ID，例如 Ethereum 钱包地址 0x26…859 即 everPay 的账户 ID，Arweave 钱包地址 5NP…HXo 也是 everPay 的账户 ID。协议中的所有交易使用了 ID 对应的私钥进行签名。\n\neverPay 目前已经支持 Ethereum 和 Arweave。随着更多链的接入，将来会支持更多的链地址成为 everPay 的账户 ID。\n\n### 互联网账户\n\neverPay 可以支持传统互联网账号，使用邮箱或者手机号作为账号 ID。通过 Webauthn\\[6\\] 技术，everPay 可以将手机等硬件上的加密芯片作为账户的密钥。为保障账户的安全性，账号和硬件设备进行绑定。进行交易时，用户需要通过生物识别调用硬件加密芯片进行数字签名。如果设备丢失或者需要更换设备，可以使用邮箱进行安全恢复。例如 google 邮箱账户恢复：google 的所有邮件都使用了 google 的密钥进行签署，以防止邮件伪造，这份签署可以使用密码学进行验证。everPay 的账户系统使用了邮件的签名验证功能，对邮件内容进行签名验证用于账户恢复。\n\n账户恢复也可以通过联系人验证的方式进行。用户提前为账户设置好守卫（guards），守卫可以由多个关键联系人构成。用户需要进行账号恢复时可以通过多个守卫的签名对账户密钥进行替换。通过守卫恢复的方式和现有的智能合约钱包 Argent 非常相似。\n\n# 支付原语（opAction）\n\n为了满足不同的支付场景，everPay 协议支持多种支付原语。用户和商户可以根据自己的业务需求使用不同的支付原语。将来伴随更多的支付业务拓展，everPay 会支持更多的支付原语。\n\n所有的支付原语可以通过下载 SDK everpay-js 集成到应用中。仅需要数行代码即可调用支付原语进行交易。\n\n### 基础原语\n\n**充值（mint）**\n\n使用 everPay 进行支付，首先需要将其他链的资产充值到协议中。充值时用户只需要消费原生链上的手续费，将 Ethereum 上的代币充值到 everPay 需要等待 6 个 Ethereum 区块，将 Arweave 上的资产充值到 everPay 需要等待 15 个 Arweave 区块。充值成功后用户在 everPay 上的资产余额会增加。\n\n**提现（burn）**\n\n资产需要回到原生链时，使用提现功能。提现时用户必须在 everPay 协议中有相应的资产余额。提现需要等待提现交易批量打包到 Arweave 后，等待守望者监听到提现交易。守望者对所有的交易进行独立验证，并生成对应的提现提案。提案被超过 51% 的守望者签署后在原生链上执行并完成提现动作。提现成功后，用户在 everPay 上的资产余额减少，原生链上用户会收到对应的资产。\n\n**转账（transfer）**\n\n在 everPay 协议上拥有资产余额的用户可以进行转账。转账属于 MetaTransaction，通常在区块链上转账需要使用原生代币进行矿工费支付，everPay 的 MetaTransaction 则支持使用转账的代币进行费用支付。转账时，用户使用账户私钥进行签名，交易发送给协调者之后会被立即验证，非法的交易无法通过协调者验证。\n\n目前 everPay 已经支持了 Ethereum 和 Arweave 两条链的账户模型，因此转账的收款地址可以是任何的 Ethereum 地址或者 Arweave 地址，收款时不需要原生链的用户在 everPay 中注册，everPay 默认支持所有的有效 Ethereum 地址和 Arweave 地址。将来 everPay 会集成更多的区块链，支持更多的区块链账户体系。\n\n### 批量转账（bundle）\n\neverPay 支持将多笔转账绑定到一笔交易中进行事务性执行。在进行批量转账的时候，绑定的多笔转账必须全部成功，整个交易才能达成；如果多笔转账中如果有一笔转账失败，则整个交易进行事务性的回滚。\n\n批量转账除了可以支持一次性向多人进行付款，也可用于开发去中心化交易兑换，保证多个对手方的交易达成才进行有效结算。\n\n### 原子兑换（aswap）\n\n原子兑换是专门为订单薄模式交易设计的交易原语。不同于批量转账，原子兑换必须有 maker 和 taker 两个对手方，会对 maker 和 taker 的资产进行原子交换。如果 maker 和 taker 的资产交换不能同时满足，原子兑换会进行事务性的回滚。\n\n### 时间锁（timelock）\n\n部分场景下，为了促成交易达成，资产需要被锁定一段时间并等到对手方提供凭证才能进行结算。如在线上购物时如何保护买卖双方不受到侵害。买方 a 需要支付一笔费用 A 购买物品 B，卖方 b 收到订单后，需要等待三天时间才能将物品 B 寄送到 a 手里。此时存在多种欺诈的可能性：\n\n1. 卖方 b 欺诈：a 向 b 支付了费用，但是 b 未向 a 寄送货物 B\n2. 买方 a 欺诈：b 向 a 寄送了货物，但是 a 未向 b 支付费用\n\n使用时间锁能解决欺诈问题：a 向 b 支付一笔带时间锁的费用，费用锁定期限为4 天，需要提供证明才能完成支付。在规定期限内，b 不能提供证明则费用退回 a，提供证明则费用完成支付。\n\neverPay 协议可以支持多种凭证证明的时间锁，例如：使用 Ethereum 上的信息进行支付解锁，或通过第三方仲裁进行支付解锁等。\n\n## 业务\n\n### 实时转账\n\neverPay 提供接近传统支付体验的转账功能。\n\n进行区块链交易需要等待交易打包，交易打包的速度从数秒到几十分钟不等，区块的交易体验远远达不到普通的支付体验需求。everPay 协议使用协调者采集交易，可以进行实时确认的转账交易。协调者服务器在收到用户交易时会立即进行计算和验证，在毫秒级返回交易状态。\n\n![everPay 生态](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jVbxkXwh39Lku5CE0Dni-.png?height=900&width=1800)\n\n### 代币跨链\n\n使用 SCP 构建的 everPay 易于构建跨链系统\\[7\\]。目前 everPay 已经集成 Ethereum 和 Arweave 两条链，并将 Arweave 原生代币 AR 映射到 Ethereum 生成 WAR\\[8\\]。WAR 是 AR 的 ERC20 版本，WAR 的生成由 everPay 的 DAO 进行治理，具备透明性和 100% 可验证。everPay 能提供极好的跨链提现，使用 Arweave 钱包 ArConnect 连接 everPay 进行 AR 充值，在提现时候选择 Ethereum 填写对应的以太坊地址地址就可以完成跨链，整个过程在一小时内完成。\n\n协议的跨链特性会扩展到不同的区块链，不同的代币。未来 everPay 会成为一个支持多链的中继代币支付层。\n\n### 智能账户\n\neverPay 支持各种链的账户，甚至可以支持互联网账户。链下计算让 everPay 的账户体系具备最佳的灵活性。\n\n现有的区块链账户对普通用户门槛太高，非对称加密让用户难以理解，助记词的安全管理导致密钥泄露事件频繁发生。everPay 将为用户打造智能账户，将账户和硬件设备绑定保障安全性，硬件设备的生物识别技术提升了易用性。智能账户和现有的互联网账户具备相同的体验，让用户可以轻松的使用区块链。\n\n### 兑换\n\n支付原语中的批量转账和原子兑换是打造去中心化交易所\\[9\\]的基础工具。\n\n批量转账可以在多个对手方之间进行事务性兑换，其中一个对手方的交易失败则会让整个交易回滚，使用批量转账功能可以为用户和做市商之间建立去信任化的兑换方式，在签署批量转账交易后，仅有满足兑换双方的兑换要求交易才能成交。\n\n原子兑换是为订单薄模式的去中心化交易所提供的基础支付原语。用户可以为既定价格签署订单，同意该订单签署的任何第三方都可以对该订单进行吃单。交易双方的兑换都必须满足既定价格订单才能成交。\n\n### 理财\n\neverPay 协议会为用户提供跨链聚合理财。通过链下计算收集用户的理财需求，在一层进行一次性执行，可以极大地降低了区块链理财成本。配合 everPay 的智能账户，区块链理财的门槛也随之降低，用户可以像使用传统理财产品一样体验区块链理财。\n\n使用理财时，用户需要使用密钥完成理财合约签署，资产通过时间锁在 everPay 中进行锁定。这些理财合约会被守望者进行解释并生成理财提案，合法的提案达到 51% 的守望者签署后在 Ethereum 上执行。\n\n# 代币和治理\n\neverPay 协议的共识由权威机构参与 DAO 进行管理。随着业务和技术的发展，在保障安全性和易用性的前提下，将逐渐的过度到代币治理模式。\n\n目前，everPay 没有制定代币发行计划，会集中精力在基础设施打造和生态建设。团队会积极探索代币治理模型，寻找合适的时机将 everPay 协议过渡到完全的 DAO。\n\n# Roadmap\n\n### 2021\n\n* 支持：批量转账支付原语\n* 去中心化兑换\n* Arweave PSTs 跨链\n* 寻求 Watchmen 合作机构\n\n### 2022\n\n* 支付原语\n  * 原子兑换\n

{"id": "7FOShuHW9dSTpuGN0hyKoJRN1afOsnkYjzmi3bRtq_k", "title": "From Kyoto Protocol to Klima Protocol (🌳,🌳)\n", "body": "It was approximately 12:30 am in Amsterdam. I had a flight back to the states the next morning which I’d have to get up early for. Still, there I was, trying every cheap trick I knew (hard refresh, switch to Firefox?) to get Klima DAO’s application to work for me. I needed to claim my aKLIMA to swap them for KLIMA tokens. Then I’d ‘stake’ my KLIMA and start reaping a 300,000% annual percentage yield (“APY”). Or I could sell my KLIMA tokens, which had just launched public trading hours earlier at a price of $323. Post launch, KLIMA immediately skyrocketed north of $1,200. Then it kept climbing.\n\nIf all of this sounds like a foreign language, it’s because the processes can indeed be pretty labyrinthine for the uninitiated. I’ve been deep in the crypto and ‘DeFi’ trenches for months. Navigating the Klima DAO launch was still challenging. My interest was less motivated by ‘generational wealth’ (as opposed to the majority of the folks in the #price-talk channel in Klima DAO’s Discord server). Rather, I ‘reserved’ a few aKLIMA \\~6 weeks ago to properly diligence this emergent, ambitious, complicated entity, whose stated goal is to make carbon offsets more expensive.\n\nIn the short time since they first crossed my radar, Klima DAO has tapped a very powerful asset, namely the confluence of two major memes in today’s zeitgeist ⚡. The first is the need for climate action. People know we need to take action about climate. The chance to *feel* like you’re doing something is irresistible, especially when so much discussion about climate is couched in the language of certain doom. In parallel, the allure of making money, whether it be in sports betting, stocks, or crypto is oozing out of every pore of our increasingly digital, gamified society 📈.\n\nKlima DAO has harnessed both these movements to gain a massive amount of momentum. But what *is* Klima DAO? It is at once a discord server with 30,000 members, an organization with aims of being “decentralized” and “autonomous” (read as: governed by their own members, ideally leveraging as much code as process for the autonomous part). It has its own crypto token, KLIMA, and a corresponding set of monetary policies. And its aim is to impact prices in a very ‘real-world’ market.\n\nSpecifically? Klima DAO wants to help fight climate change. In their words:\n\n> Klima DAO is a collective of environmentalists, developers and entrepreneurs who aim to pool their knowledge and expertise to drive change in the carbon markets, today. (see [here](https://docs.klimadao.finance/klima.fi-manifesto))\n\nWhy carbon markets? Let’s dive down the rabbit hole 🐰🕳️.\n\n### A word on carbon markets 🏭\n\nThe size of the carbon market as a whole was [north of $250B last year](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-carbon-idUSKBN29W1HR). There are lots of products and submarkets under this umbrella, including [voluntary and mandatory](https://www.offsetguide.org/understanding-carbon-offsets/carbon-offset-programs/mandatory-voluntary-offset-markets/) carbon markets. We’re focused on voluntary markets here, i.e. the ones that companies and people like you and I participate in when we buy ‘carbon offsets’.\n\nWhat are carbon offsets? Specifically, one carbon offset represents the avoidance or removal of one tonne of CO2 equivalent emissions (“CO2-e”). These offsets are supplied by projects that can prove they prevented or removed emissions to parties that want to reduce their *net* emissions footprint 👣. An example of a project that would supply carbon offsets might be one that preserves a rainforest whose flora sucks up carbon 🦜. Carbon offset projects are subject to a bevy of different verification standards. [Verra](https://verra.org/project/vcs-program/), which has facilitated the issuance of [almost 800M carbon offsets](https://verra.org/), and [Gold Standard](https://www.goldstandard.org/) are among the most prominent.\n\nCarbon offsets are purchased by all kinds of organizations. The market for voluntary markets is a beast of its own, forecast to [grow to $1B this year](https://www.wsj.com/articles/carbon-offsets-are-used-by-companies-seeking-net-zero-but-concerns-persist-11635079489) (as an aside, the fact that Klima DAO’s market cap at one point equaled the size of the entire voluntary offset markets’ is fun). Meanwhile, the parade of corporations touting new net-zero emissions targets would have been hard to miss over the past years. Companies like [Delta and Google](https://www.statista.com/chart/23751/companies-buying-carbon-offsets/) have emissions targets they would otherwise exceed were it not for carbon offsets. Carbon offset pricing varies depending on their source; the different projects that produce them all have different economics. Many offsets on the market are pretty cheap at current; a simple benchmark would be around $10 per tonne of CO2e.\n\n### The Klima DAO mission 🎯\n\nKlima DAO exists to make the price of carbon offsets more expensive 📈. Why? At current, there’s no real cost associated with *emitting* CO2. There almost definitely should be. If we were able to calculate the full cost of carbon emissions, taking into account all negative externalities on society, e.g. the future costs of global warming, habitat destruction, worse air quality, etc., emissions might [be very expensive](https://twitter.com/XavierHelgesen/status/1446620855677583360).\n\nKlima DAO identifies this challenge as core to their mission. They write:\n\n> *Companies and consumers do not pay (enough) for these negative externalities, and are therefore emitting too much carbon. This is a market failure – the market by itself does not internalize the costs of these emissions...A perfect market should price in carbon.* ([here](https://docs.klimadao.finance/blogs/about-carbon-offsets))\n\nWhile there’s no price for carbon, there *is* a price for carbon offsets. What if the carbon offsets became more scarce? In lieu of a true tax on carbon, this would increase their price and act as a ‘cost’ on the heavy CO2 emitters that buy them.\n\nThat’s exactly what Klima DAO wants to do — they want to become a “black hole” for carbon offsets 🕳️. First, their system (the “protocol”) has to attract capital. To do so, they’ve embraced the financial infrastructure of crypto. Which is smart — there are few forces stronger than the willingness of crypto market participants to ‘ape’ 🦍 (i.e. deploy large sums of capital with minimal diligence) into the latest token, provided it has momentum. Once the capital starts flowing, Klima DAO uses it to siphon carbon offsets out of traditional markets.\n\nHow does this work? Let’s take a look under the hood 🏎️.\n\n### The mechanics ‎‍🔧\n\nHow does Klima DAO acquire carbon offsets? First, offsets have to be taken out of traditional markets and brought on-chain. Klima DAO relies on the [Toucan Protocol](https://docs.toucan.earth/protocol/introduction/master) to execute this; Toucan operates a ‘carbon bridge’ that takes carbon offsets from registries we’ve discussed (currently they work exclusively with [Verra’s VCUs](https://verra.org/project/vcs-program/registry-system/verified-carbon-units-vcus/)) and brings them onto [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), a blockchain built on top of Ethereum. In the process, the offsets are turned into a commoditized, tradable unit represented by a token, [BCT](https://cryptobuyingtips.com/guides/how-to-buy-toucan-protocol-base-carbon-tonne-bct).\n\n> *Base Carbon Tonnes (BCT) is a reference token representing one tonne of carbon from the Verra Verified Carbon Unit (VCU) registry from 2008 or later, bridged by the Toucan Protocol.*\n\nKlima DAO doesn’t just raise money to buy BCTs though. That would be boring. Instead, Klima DAO introduces its own token, “KLIMA,” too. Why? To gamify the entire system. KLIMA is the piece of the puzzle 🧩 that , coupled with the voracious appetite and capital from the crypto market, powers the ‘black hole’ for carbon offsets.\n\nHow does KLIMA supercharge new BCT purchases? To start, they back each KLIMA with at least one BCT. Before new KLIMA can be created, Klima DAO has to acquire more BCT:\n\n> *...a new KLIMA can only be minted by locking a BCT (Base Carbon Tonne) in the Klima DAO Treasury and removing it from the market...* *the treasury backs every KLIMA token by at least one tonne of carbon offsets, which guarantees that users can always sell their KLIMA for at least one tonne.“* (Source [here](https://docs.klimadao.finance/))\n\nFrom there, incentives / monetary mechanics are layered in to accelerate BCT accumulation:\n\n* When the total market capitalization of KLIMA is higher than the value of the carbon offsets in its treasury, Klima DAO issues bonds to market participants in exchange for BCTs.\n* Importantly, these bonds are redeemable for KLIMA at a *discounted rate* to market price (after a vesting period has passed), making buying BCTs to acquire these bonds an attractive way to get your hands on KLIMA.\n* By selling the bonds, Klima DAO increases its store of BCTs. With more BCT in hand, it can issue new KLIMA.\n* If a virtuous cycle of price appreciation can be upheld, more investors will elect to contribute BCT to the Klima DAO treasury in order to get a discount on new KLIMA.\n\nHow does Klima DAO try to keep up said virtuous cycle of price appreciation? For one, if you believe carbon offsets will become more expensive over time, then the value of Klima DAO’s treasury holdings should appreciate too. For that trade you could just buy BCTs on your own though, so Klima DAO also introduces a profit distribution mechanism as an additional incentive to hold KLIMA. This mechanism distributes newly minted KLIMA to existing investors who choose to ‘stake’ their holdings. You can think of this as a sort of dividend rate for holding KLIMA, designed to attract even more investors to the Klima DAO ecosystem:\n\n> *Staking is designed to incentivize longer-term holding of KLIMA, and to give market participants exposure to the rising price of carbon. The longer participants hodl \\[sic — it’s a crypto joke\\] and stake, the more they compound and the more KLIMA tokens they will have when they unstake.* (More [here](https://docs.klimadao.finance/klima-dao-ecosystem)).\n\nAt launch, the APY for staking KLIMA was an eye-watering 300,000%. While the rate has come down since, at the initial rate, it would only have taken you 33 days to double your KLIMA holdings when staked. How is this APY set? This is where things get a touch sophisticated. Suffice it to say that it is contingent *both* on a rewards rate that Klima DAO sets via governance, and by market dynamics (e.g. how much new KLIMA is minted in any given period and how many people have staked their KLIMA).\n\nThe main takeaway for us is that Klima DAO pays out newly minted KLIMA to its holders as an additional incentive for holding the token. This newly minted KLIMA is also inflationary though, which *should* put a damper on the KLIMA price. What happens when it doesn’t though? Proceed 👉.\n\n### The bull run 🐂\n\nIf you were an early member of the Klima DAO community, you could buy KLIMA at [$10 per token](https://klimadao.medium.com/what-is-klima-dao-initial-discord-offering-5735c996c2ac). As of this writing, the token trades around $2,000 (down from a high of $3,500). And holders who stake their KLIMA are still earning four-five digit APYs to boot 💰. At $3,500 per KLIMA (approximately the high watermark so far), Klima DAO’s market capitalization eclipsed the $1B mark 🤯.\n\nWhy are people piling into KLIMA? Sure, there are probably some valiant climate warriors involved who participate in hopes of punishing companies that emit a lot of carbon. Getting investment exposure to the carbon offset market, as far as a long-term strategy is concerned, also has tailwinds speaking in favor of it. Even before Klima DAO and Toucan launched, the [offset market was heating up](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/27/bank-of-america-carbon-offset-market-to-x-50-to-meet-net-zero-goals.html). Some people may also buy KLIMA to participate in governing the DAO — tokens will grant future voting rights 🗳️.\n\nI assume however that it’s the promise of big time investment returns that the majority of participants at this stage are interested in. The crypto infrastructure that Klima DAO has integrated speaks directly to a cohort of rabid crypto traders who are always scouring the internet for their next big score. Klima DAO has captured their capital and attention to build momentum for the project. And they’ve done so very consciously. As one anon Klima DAO leader said in a recent [interview on the Bankless podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bankless/id1499409058?i=1000535838797):\n\n> *We’re Game-stopping the voluntary carbon market; using the incentive structure to drive more and more demand for these carbon credits.*\n\nThe alluring power of the games Klima DAO has designed is perhaps most clearly exhibited in Klima DAO’s mantra, (🌳, 🌳), which combines the deciduous tree emoji with “(3,3).” (3,3) is a game theory meme taken from another DAO that highlights that the most beneficial action for market participants is to stake their asset and sit pretty (nash equilibrium, for you nerds 🤓).\n\nWith the price of KLIMA holding strong for now, it looks like folks are heeding the (🌳, 🌳) call. Call it incentives, gamification 🎮, or gambling 🎰, it’s working.\n\n### The impact 💥\n\nLast week, Klima DAO noted it has already brought [8M tonnes of carbon offsets on-chain](https://twitter.com/KlimaDAO/status/1452635939889729536) (perhaps this gone up since). Estimates of what percentage of the total current available supply of carbon offsets in voluntary markets vary, but some pegged it as high as 5%. (We’ll revisit this claim later in “The Challenges” section).\n\nThe carbon market is notoriously difficult to quantify and measure, plus it’s super fractured, so it’s hard for us to corroborate exactly what % supply of which market Klima DAO has hoovered up. The claim that we’ve seen a measurable impact on price does seem to be corroborated by whispers and reports from the offset industry and carbon market themselves though. See for instance this from [Carbon Pulse last week](https://carbon-pulse.com/142130/):\n\n> Standardised voluntary emissions reduction (VER) prices for CORSIA- and nature-based units trended up towards fresh record highs on exchanges this week, with voluntary carbon market (VCM) participants citing involvement by speculative firms and crypto traders for the increase.\n\nIf this can be sustained, it could accelerate the rate at which companies are forced to explore real solutions to *reduce* their emissions, not just offset them. Further, if the price of carbon offsets rises, it could attract more offsetting projects to come online and fill the supply gap.\n\n> Importantly, carbon offsets provide critical financing for sustainability projects, including forest conservation and renewable energy generation. (More [here](https://klimadao.medium.com/carbon-markets-retail-offset-pricing-4eab0f6196c0)).\n\nEspecially projects known as “frontier” carbon offsetting or removal projects, like [chemically bonding carbon to minerals and turning it into stone](https://www.heirloomcarbon.com/), need capital to prove the viability of their processes, navigate formal verification, and to subsequently scale them. If carbon offsets cost $10, these projects aren’t viable. If offsets cost $100 or $1,000, the economics might change.\n\nZooming out, what Toucan is doing to create a more liquid market for BCTs is very important. As we noted above, legacy markets are fractured and often illiquid; there are countless benefits that come with the transparency that a more liquid market would provide. We’ll save a deeper exploration of these for a future report on the Toucan protocol and BCTs themselves. Finally, at the risk of glossing over the obvious, I think what Klima DAO is doing in general, namely trying to turn crypto infrastructure, capital, and trading habits into climate impact, is laudable.\n\n### The challenges 🤨\n\nAt the beginning of this piece, I noted that the chance to *feel* like you’re contributing positively towards climate is a key motivator in today’s zeitgeist. Klima DAO offers this in droves. But how real is the climate impact here? Considering the allure of the rewards systems that Klima DAO has set up and the momentum that their token has garnered since launching a few weeks ago, this is a key question. If a bunch of people allocate time and money to this space and it turns out the climate promises weren’t all we thought they were, that could be a big blow to future crypto / climate projects.\n\nThe first question we should ask in aims of full intellectual honesty here is whether the carbon offsetting market is where we should be focusing our attention at all. Should the idea of a carbon-neutral oil & gas industry even exist?\n\nLet’s first look at the challenges inherent to offsets themselves. For one, carbon offsets aren’t all created equal, even if they all end up in the same commoditized on-chain pool (BCTs). One tonne of direct air carbon capture (DAC) vs one tonne of offsets achieved via reforestation doesn’t achieve the same thing, at least not right away; the tonne offset via reforestation takes longer to manifest (trees need time to mature), and assumes the trees won’t be burned or logged, even hundreds of years from now.\n\nCarbon offsets with older vintages can also be [considerably cheaper than newer offsets](https://about.bnef.com/blog/unlike-fine-wines-carbon-offsets-get-worse-with-age/). In pursuit of best practices around offsetting, corporations may try to purchase offsets that were issued in the same year in which the emissions they are looking to offset occurred. If an offset was issued in 2015, there are fewer potential buyers for it, as fewer companies had committed to any net-emissions targets then or were tracking their emissions readily. While carbon offsets in general may get more expensive in the coming decades, older vintages could actually be depreciating assets.\n\nKlima DAO’s current model is set up to buy the cheapest offsets. At this stage, that can mean buying lower quality (older vintage) offsets as well more of the “future avoidance” types of offsetting projects instead of say, the DAC carbon removals we discussed earlier. Of course, in many cases, these could still be offsets an Exxon or a Chevron would have bought otherwise, so this isn’t a critical flaw by any means.\n\nMoving on, it also seems like almost every day, some new [Fortune 500 company is beleaguered by charges](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/shell-s-carbon-offset-claims-show-task-ahead-for-un-climate-talks) that a carbon offset project they worked with didn’t prevent, capture or sequester CO2 in the way it said it would, or that standards weren’t upheld over time. At the level of standards and offset verification, even institutions like Verra have to [play defense re: accusations](https://verra.org/verra-response-to-guardian-article-on-carbon-offsets-used-by-major-airlines/) that projects in their registry aren’t up to snuff.\n\nNow, on the carbon offset *markets*. Carbon offset markets are historically plagued by double counting issues. Not only have there been significant challenges with carbon offsets being sold multiple times (if two different organizations can buy and then re-sell the same offset, they shouldn’t both be able to claim it towards their net emissions goals). Additionally, as Paul Gambill (CEO of [Nori](https://keepcool.co/nori-deepdive/)) explains, countries in which offsets are produced [often claim the same offsets that other entities then purchase](https://twitter.com/paulgambill/status/1449517958531674112/video/1) (another form of double counting). Offsets can be often flawed even before they are brought on-chain. These things aren’t Klima DAO’s fault, but they do raise the question of how worthwhile targeting offsets as a change mechanism is to begin with.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that companies that want access to a lot of offsets increasingly sidestep traditional carbon offset markets entirely. They’ve already forecasted the supply crunch Klima DAO hopes to accelerate and they hire teams to do diligence on and [buy entire offsetting projects](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/052621-larger-buyers-of-carbon-credits-buying-entire-projects) to produce offsets for them exclusively (and at scale). While they’re still competing for the same resource conceptually, as they opt out of the markets that Klima DAO targets, Klima DAO may need to shift its tactics.\n\nThis speaks to a broader point that Klima DAO is quite conscious of, namely that the supply of offsets itself is inflationary. You can occasion a short-term run on supply, sure. But once you’ve pulled it off, you’d likely see a raft of new offsetting projects come online. This would be a good thing for the planet, but perhaps not for the Klima DAO ecosystem. With a new wave of offset supply coming online, the value of the BCTs in Klima DAO’s treasury could decrease substantially from a high watermark. In short, even if BCTs do increase in value over time, it won’t be linear. I’ll be interested to see how carbon offset price volatility impacts Klima DAO’s ability to sustain a positive feedback loop. How strong will (🌳, 🌳) be if the treasury value gets cut in half?\n\nPerhaps most importantly, and more specific to Klima DAO, while the offsets that Toucan Protocol bridges [are listed as ‘retired’ in the Verra registry](https://twitter.com/wagmianon/status/1453140959013838848), what’s critical is that the offsets are fully retired *on-chain* too.\n\nPursuant to this point, a quote we read earlier might have raised flags for you 🚩:\n\n> ...the treasury backs every KLIMA token by at least one tonne of carbon offsets, which guarantees that users can always sell their KLIMA for at least one tonne.\n\n'Burning' (destroying) would be the best way to truly retire the offsets, but would also mean the value of the Klima DAO treasury would be 0. As long as the treasury pool of carbon offsets is viewed as ‘backing,’ and if users can “always sell their KLIMA for at least one tonne”, then we’re not really talking about retirement here. The Klima DAO team has corroborated this themselves, stating in their server:\n\n> ...our treasury is designed to be one-way, at least for now - we hold the BCTs in reserve to back KLIMA issuance...there are a few scenarios where BCT could flow out of the treasury, most notably if KLIMA price fell below 1 BCT we would step in as buyer of last resort.\n\nIf Klima DAO had to sell BCT from the treasury to buy back KLIMA, what would stop another party from claiming these BCTs at a later date? These offsets still very much exist, just in a different form. At minimum, they should be accounted for differently in Verra’s registry. Further, to say Klima DAO is a ‘blackhole’ for offsets is inaccurate. Nothing can escape a blackhole once it crosses the event horizon; the gravitational pull of the black hole is too strong. With respect to Klima DAO, while I wrote earlier that the power of crypto market participants can be quasi-gravitational, it can also be quite ephemeral ⌛. BCTs can escape Klima DAO’s treasury again.\n\nThere are also challenges with how Klima DAO describes its aggregate impact. [@_boodle](https://twitter.com/_boodle), who kindly provided comments on this entire piece, wrote the following:\n\n> Klima DAO claims to have 8M tonnes of offsets in its treasury. At the time of writing, there were only 1.6M ‘pure’ BCTs in the treasury. The rest of the 8M consists of [‘liquidity pool](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/what-is-a-liquidity-pool-crypto-market-liquidity#:\\~:text=A%20liquidity%20pool%20is%20a,a%20decentralized%20exchange%20(DEX).)’ shares (“LP shares”), including shares in a KLIMA/BCT pool. These LP shares represent a credit for the underlying tokens in the pool (KLIMA and BCT for the KLIMA/BCT pool). As far as counting these offsets as captured though, these pools \\*exist\\* for people to trade against them. Let’s say that market participants decide that KLIMA is overvalued compared to BCT. LP share owners can draw on the KLIMA/BCT pool directly, depositing their KLIMA to pull out BCT at the current market rate. When that trade is made, the BCT that was counted towards the current 8M figure is pulled from the pool. This is an even more direct mechanism whereby BCT can exit Klima DAO.\n\nKlima DAO is more like a [cartel cornering a market](https://dirtroads.substack.com/p/-19-klima-a-family-story) or a dragon sleeping on a pile of gold 🐉. If you don’t fully retire offsets, the impact of hoarding them can reverse at a later date ⏪. If something happens to the dragon, you could see a flood of carbon offset supply coming back *onto* the market.\n\nIf the answer to why this *won’t* happen is that the price of KLIMA will continue to be above the value of the treasury, then that gives me pause too. Klima DAO’s systems obviously work well when the hype is on. But if the systems constantly require fresh capital to sustain themselves and to avoid releasing a bunch of BCTs back onto the market, then I start to wonder at what point it’d be better for investors to just buy the underlying BCTs and hold them themselves.\n\nI can of course see *why* burning hasn’t been implemented. KLIMA’s intrinsic value is its treasury of offsets, which it hopes will increase in value. That’s a huge part of their differentiation. If you burned all the offsets, you’d just have an inflationary token with staking rewards. There’s plenty of those in crypto.\n\n### Final thoughts 👋\n\nI had some reservations about saving “The Challenges” section for the back half of this piece. In the same way that it would be easy to appreciate the ambition of Klima DAO and the milestones they’ve achieved so far without digging deep on the mechanics, it would be easy to read the first half of this and conclude that I’m unequivocally bullish.\n\nWhat am I bullish on? I’m bullish on incentivizing emissions reduction, whether at the individual, corporate, country or global level. I’m bullish on incentivizing new carbon offset and removal projects and development of new technologies. And I’m bullish on democratizing access to new asset classes, carbon included.\n\nFor me to be bullish on Klima DAO as a project from a *climate* perspective, I’d like to see commitments for at least temporary ‘sequestration’ of the offsets they bring into their treasury. Could Klima DAO commit to a measure of minimum permanence; i.e. all offsets are locked in the treasury for a minimum of ten years, in the same way carbon offset projects themselves must prove to sequester carbon for minimum thresholds of time? It’d also be great to see the entire supply chain of offsets, from Verra to the treasury, audited by someone who understands carbon markets much better than I do.\n\nI’d also like to see the first wave of hype subside 🌊. The people who keep building after that will be the ones who address the challenges including and beyond those I’ve identified. Having spent a decent chunk of time in the #carbon-markets channel in Klima DAO’s Discord server, I have seen many folks who are active and understand carbon markets *much* more intimately then I do. I hope they stick around 🤞.\n\nMy broader hope is that Klima DAO is a battering ram for crypto x climate companies, applications, and protocols. There are many other projects (e.g. [Nori](https://nori.com/) and [Regen network](https://www.regen.network/)) [and DAOs](https://twitter.com/TheEdenDao) targeting the carbon market with crypto infrastructure that are following closely behind. If Klima DAO paves a path for them to garner attention, investment, and their own hype cycle? That’d be an achievement in and of itself 🌱.\n\nAnd if there are challenges that Klima DAO doesn’t deliberately and openly address? That will sour peoples’ perspective on future projects with adjacent missions. The first DAO ever [raised more than $100M… only to catastrophically fail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)). That set Ethereum back massively. The first crypto / climate protocol to hit a billion dollar market cap is naturally attracting a lot of attention. It has a lot riding on it 👀.

How come he could pick up some colourful and heavy things on the shelf and lock himself in the room for the whole day? I imitated his behaviour but hardly understood a word from his accounting, economy and management books.\n\nOne day, I browsed my Dad’s treasures and found one book rather fascinating. [The Life of Friedrich Nietzsche by Daniel Halévy](https://amzn.to/3ryLJv2) (The Chinese translation version of that book called Friedrich Nietzsche: I’m the Sun《尼采传：我是太阳》) triggered me because that’s the only few words I could recognise at the young age. I felt highly excited like Archimedes leapt out of the bath and rushed home naked crying, “Eureka! Eureka!” I thought I found the universal truth that the Sun is this beard and weird-looking guy!\n\nMy family made fun of me about how I secretly told everyone, “do you know the Sun has a name called Ni Cai (Nietzsche’s pronunciation in Chinese)?” and how I regarded myself as a detective scientist who decodes the identity of the Sun. Silly, right? That childhood mystery followed me for ages until I learnt at school what **metaphor** is and who the real Nietzsche is, and apparently, there is a conventional rule to name things in our society, including the Sun.\n\nMy old friend’ Nietzsche didn’t fade away with my stupidity but lingered around my life and led me to dig more about him and his fellow philosophers. As his saying goes, **he who has a why to live can bear almost any how**. Like many rebellious, moody and self-centred teenagers in my adolescent years, I blamed my parents for everything because “I didn’t choose to be born”. My early 20s also filled enormous pains from internal self-doubt and disturbing external facts. I didn't know why I was here and what's it for.​\n\nI wrote numerous suicide notes in my diaries but never made it into action. I suffered from a constant existential crisis but never fell into mental illness. I don’t know if I am a coward or a survivor in this life game.\n\nNow I want to share my journey of discovering my WHY (aka, my philosophy). They are my guiding principle for my short life on earth. I hope you will find yours and live life on your own terms. ​\n\n## Flowism ​\n\nMy life philosophy is Flowism, a term I made up when my best friend asked why I constantly change my mind and never settle down on one idea, a place, a job or a person. I said, “I go with a flow. I’m practising Flowism.”\n\nGoing with a flow doesn’t mean you are a fence-sitter or flip-flopper. It’s a state of following your intuition and evolving your thoughts and ideas constantly.\n\nIf the universe was an ocean, what we understand is only a drop of water. Nothing is certain. Nothing is for sure. Everything is impermanent.\n\nI am aware that I know nothing. I could explore everything with my intellectual curiosity where fate brings me. It's OK to change your mind regularly with the foundation of independent and rational thinking.\n\nThe reality is merely real. The concepts of time and space and cause and effect are an illusion. Who has the ability to define the objective truth based on our current understanding? Ask real questions and obtain a good explanation.\n\nAll things are neutral. Everything depends on our perspectives toward this world. We choose to fall into nihilism or decide to make everything meaningful to ourselves. If nothing matters, just have a fun journey and be like a cheerful nihilist.\n\nAll things, including people, come and go. Not forcing, not interfering, just accepting everything.\n\nLife is a single-player game with sufferings from desire, departure and detestation. Once you accept this setting, everything you encounter in your life will be more acceptable and enjoyable.\n\nThe meta meaning of living is existing. Existing is a pain. Once we go into a flow state of an egoless mind, everything will become nothing. I am nothing. Nothing is painful anymore.\n\nOur thoughts and ideas, or so-called free wills, are inextricably tied to language, and language is socially constructed. We are all socially conditioned.\n\nWhat I try to say here may sound different from what I mean, but it doesn’t matter. Just go with your flow; go with your understanding of flowism because others, including myself, are an illusion.\n\nLife is only making sense when you look back. So, go with flow forward and collect and connect dots on the way.\n\nRemember, all things come to those who flow the way, as all wild streams and all unruly torrents drive eventually to great rivers and the sea. ​\n\n## Life Principles ​\n\nBesides my life philosophy, I also summarise and update my life principles on my birthday every year ([29](https://www.camelliayang.com/blog/happy-birthday-29), [30](https://www.camelliayang.com/blog/30-thoughts-on-turning-30), [31](https://www.camelliayang.com/blog/31-thoughts-before-i-turn-31)) as my guide for living a truthful life.\n\n2020 is a memorable year for most people due to Covid 19. I had my first anniversary of moving to London and enjoyed most of the solitude time thanks to lockdown.\n\n​People have to spend a certain amount of time staying only with themselves to hear their inner voice. Only in this way can we have a clear understanding of who we are and what we can offer to this world.\n\nHere are my 32 principles on my 32 years old birthday:\n\n1\\. Roman emperor [Marcus Aurelius](https://amzn.to/3dnOZEn) once said: “You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think”. During the pandemic, we feel like illness and death are only one inch away from us. I rethink my life priority and let death serve as my warning alarm rather than a fearful monster. Once you dare to face death, you begin to live a truthful life.\n\n2\\. Logic is a human being’s creation. The universe doesn’t give a damn about that. We all try to figure out the correlation and causation and brag about the pattern we discovered. However, there are so many black swan events happening around us. Maybe possibility and randomness are the key messages we should bear in mind.\n\n3\\. Everyone has a default setting. Don’t follow what society and others expect you to do but listen to your inner voice. We all have unique DNA and life experiences. Rather than anything, pursue your truth.\n\n4\\. Nations, money and companies are all fiction concepts. When you choose to sacrifice your time and life for those ‘unreal’ subjects, think twice. Are they worthy of it?\n\n5\\. As a Chinese saying goes, one has to put knowledge into action. What you know is not that important until you unify the mind and action together. Any knowledge that you gain but not put into action was considered delusion or false.\n\n6\\. Direction ＞ speed. There is no point you driving so fast but in the wrong way. In order to get to your destination, in the end, you have to pause and double-check you are on the right track.\n\n7\\. I don’t know what I don’t know. Therefore, I have to be rationally open-minded all the time. Stay foolish and stay hungry. If three of us are walking together, at least one of the other two is good enough to be my teacher.\n\n8\\. Building a system is better than setting up a goal. A goal is temporary, but a system is a compound machine that can help you play a long-term game. I am what I repeat. Let your actions speak for your traits and identity.\n\n9\\. Amor Fati. Memento Mori.\n\n10\\. You always have a choice. Don’t let linear thinking and simple causation lead you to the end of the road. Open your eyes and seek possibilities around you.\n\n11\\. On one hand, loss implies gain; on the other hand, gain means loss. All things are neutral and based on our perspectives to decide it’s good or bad. Be positive and find the good side of things and people.\n\n12\\. Any relationship is a good relationship as long as we are a whole person rather than a person who has a hole to seek others to fill the gap. Life is a single-player game. Let’s appreciate everyone we met on the journey.\n\n13\\. When I take photos, I look around and find a perfect angle. Finding different angles can also apply to interpersonal communications. Don’t let misunderstandings or pre-set judgement affect the potential relationship you are about to build up with others.\n\n14\\. It’s human being, not human doing. Live in the moment.\n\n15\\. Always have a deadline. During the lockdown, I had the privilege to attend [James Altucher](https://jamesaltucher.com/) 30 days book challenge. I am always dreaming of writing a novel in English but never find a chance to sit my ass down and write. With this 30 days time frame, I finally completed my book! Doing is better than thinking and talking.\n\n16\\. There is no universal solution that can solve all your problems. Stop reading those self-help or success stories from others. Find the suffering that you enjoy the most, and keep moving forward.\n\n17\\. Creating content is a way to express my feelings and thoughts. It also heals my trauma and pains. Every time I create a character who suffers from the exact problems facing me, I can figure out a solution for her/him in a third person’s perspective.\n\n18\\. Be careful with others’ compliments, and then you won’t pay much attention to their criticism. Your ability has a benchmark and won’t change based on others’ thoughts. But be humble to take constructive feedback.\n\n19\\. As an ancient Buddha said, perceive as you see, believe not what you perceive, then accept what you know as they are. 「老僧三十年前未参禅时，见山是山，见水是水；及至后来，亲见知识，有个入处，见山不是山，见水不是水；而今得个休歇处，依前见山只是山，见水只是水」。\n\n20\\. [John Donne](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2XwDGxhR6fojwCAzt8Oyb3?si=dRipINY7RxuoV6BD6rDjQQ) wrote the poem, “No man is an island entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee”. Consider about others surrounding you and do something within your ability to help out.\n\n21\\. Learn to forgive. Everyone is on their journey. You don’t know what others are suffering. Be kind.\n\n22\\. Find someone who both of you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably share silence.\n\n23\\. [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/) mentioned the concept of ‘Emotional Diversity’. Clarify your emotions and know what triggered them. Don’t let emotions serve as your master, especially during the decision-making process.\n\n24\\. As [Kevin Kelly](https://kk.org/) said, the universe is conspiring behind your back to make you a success. Embrace this concept and accept the gift that the universe gives to you. Then share it with this world.\n\n25\\. You are not your emotions, your thoughts and your body. You are your actions and the feelings you bring to others.\n\n26\\. What we do every day will shape the future. When our bodies vanished, our cultural memes would live forever. We have to pay attention to our thoughts and actions to generate a promising future for the next generations.\n\n27\\. [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/) mentioned every city has its personalities and ambitions. Pick up your city carefully that won’t drag you back but help you to find your tribes. London is a perfect choice for me as a football and literature enthusiast.\n\n28\\. Create your daily routine that can generate compound interest, and repeat, repeat and repeat. As [Albert Camus](https://amzn.to/3mcYaeP) said, “the struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy”.\n\n29\\. A life without constant examination is not worth living. As [Naval](https://nav.al/) said, a proper examination should ruin the life that you’re currently living. There is nothing wrong with continuous changing your surroundings, your networkings and your lifestyles. People have different priorities in their life stages. Examine your focus and do not be afraid of change.\n\n30\\. Learn to surrender. Control what you can control and let things go with the flow of what they are supposed to be.\n\n31\\. “There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.” --Albert Einstein ​32. Life is only making sense when you look back. Collect and connect dots on the way.\n\n## Origins  ​\n\nI was born in Jinan, Shandong Province, China, where under the tremendous influence of **Confucianism** emphasised personal and governmental morality, the correctness of social relationships, justice, kindness, and sincerity. I was taught to respect and obey authorities and elders and sacrifice individual welfare to achieve a group goal.\n\nI was a Merit Student throughout primary school because I knew how to please others by studying hard and obeying all the rules. I remembered so vividly on the graduation day of primary school, my best friend Shixin told me, “You have such a beautiful pair of eyes, but I can’t find any happiness inside them. I wish you a happy life.”\n\nI was shocked, and then I cried.\n\nThat was the first time I realised I lived a pretentious life and never be a happy kid deep inside. All I did was oppress my free spirit to adapt to mainstream society to get approval from others. What’s it for? Why do I do that? What’s my purpose? Those self-examination questions lead me to so many depressing hours during my childhood.\n\nAs you might know, **Three Teachings** (Buddhism, Daoism and Confucianism) is a traditional belief system in China. Many Chinese families hike and worship those Buddha Statues at the top of the mountain, visit the Taoist temple to draw a fortune stick or go to Qu Fu to pray for Confucius for their children’s education. While my parents participating in those activities, I got my first personal computer to surf online to learn more about the stories behind those three schools of thought.\n\nThanks to my grandparents, Qi Kaimin and Sun Yuzhen, the survivors of the China Cultural Revolution, who were highly educated and cultured. They devoted their retiring life to researching **Yi Jing** (also known as I Ching or Book of Changes), a book by far being considered the most consulted of all books that believe it can explain everything.\n\nMy grandparents proposed changing my name from Chenlu to Yixuan to alter my fate based on what Yi Jing said. I had no idea why I changed so dramatically after the name change (puberty hormonal changes?). I started to behave in such a rebellious way, disobeyed authorities, wrote political-sensitive content, asked numerous questions on existence that drove my parents crazy. They thought it would be better to send me overseas rather than living in a traditional Chinese society that brought everybody in trouble.\n\nI joined the exchange student program and went to New Zealand to study. The language barriers and culture shock took me to another round of loneliness and depression. I came across a Baptist Church near my school and prayed for **Christian God** to save me from suffering. Meanwhile, I attended a campus counselling service and tried to cure myself based on psychological practice. I also found libraries and bookstores were my shelters where I could temporarily escape from reality and enjoy my alone time.\n\nAfter I moved from New Zealand to the UK, I got a chance to meet and talk with people from different cultures and backgrounds where I could learn Muslim, Orthodox and other schools of religions and philosophy that originated from this part hemisphere. I read from Greek saints to German philosophers, from ancient guru to contemporary thinkers, and then developed my philosophy by standing on those giants’ shoulders.\n\nHere is the list of names and schools that influenced my philosophy to my awareness:\n\n* Stoicism, Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism and Existentialism\n* Jean-Paul Sartre, Plato, Rene Descartes, Friedrich Nietzsche, Immanuel Kant, Soren Kierkegaard, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, David Deutsch, Jed McKenna, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, G.W.F. Hegel, Ayn Rand, Rick and Morty, [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/), [Ryan Holiday](https://ryanholiday.net/), [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/), [Naval](https://nav.al/), [Kapil](https://www.kapilguptamd.com/), Ludwig Wittgenstein, Jiddu Krishnamurti\n* Among hundreds of books I read, this is the list of the top books I recommend where I benefit a lot from those writers: <https://mostrecommendedbooks.com/user/camelliayang>\n\n​\n\n## Tibet Trip ​\n\nIn 2015, I quit my first full-time job at a well-known New Zealand company because I lost my motivation and inspiration as a content creator. I went to America and indulged myself in materialistic pleasure. It was a fun month, but this kind of action provided me with a temporary solution rather than a permanent cure.\n\nI fell into a void and emptiness.\n\nBack then, my Dad made his trip to Tibet and shared photos of those majestic palaces and magical natural scenery with me. I have always been fascinated by **Tibetan Buddhism** and the profoundness of Tibetan culture. Since I was a child, I heard Princess Wencheng entering Tibet and marrying Songtsen Gampo and the story of how Tibetan used human skin to make drums.\n\nI longed for this sacred and mysterious land, and it was time for me to pay for a visit.\n\nIt took me 24 hours by train to arrive in Lhasa, Tibet. I went through horrible altitude sickness (headache and accelerated heartbeat plus breathing difficulty), but the grand scenery along the way made me survive this mammoth trip.\n\nI visited many villages where I saw the national five-star red flag flying in almost every house. I had no idea if it’s the government’s efforts or Tibetans voluntarily did so. My journalist background drove me to talk with everyone I met, but many elder villages could not speak Mandarin. Although we could not communicate, their genuine and innocent smiles made me feel very comfortable.\n\nWhat impressed me most was the Tibetan Buddhism Prostration. Tibetan Buddhism believers prostrate themselves on the ground, with the head, arms, and knees down on the ground, and move forward slowly, following every step with a kowtow. This was the way to express their most honest hearts to the Buddha, as they walked from their hometown to Lhasa, one kowtow with every three steps they took until they arrived in Lhasa (usually took a couple of months with 100,000 kowtows!).\n\nI was shocked because I never saw hundreds of people prostrating this ritual along the way. What made them so devoted? What’s the purpose for them to do so? What would they want to achieve?\n\nReflecting on my life, I had never focused on one thing, not to mention committed to any practice like that. I talked with the locals and prostrators and learnt that Buddha said our world is an illusion. **Human beings can strip themselves of this illusion through meditation and self-denial to achieve enlightenment**. The prostration practice is essential to the mind’s purification and freeing it from lousy karma due to harmful doings or thoughts.\n\nAlthough I’ve read a couple of Buddhism books before and had an idea of the Tibetan prostrator. Words on paper could not compare with seeing them practising at the Dazhao Temple in front of me! I was so touched by their actions and devotion. Moreover, visiting Dazhao Temple made me emerge the hope to our human race.\n\nThe Dazhao Temple owns its fame to its life-sized statue of the Buddha at age 12, brought to Lhasa as part of the Chinese Princess Wencheng’s dowry in 641.  1000 years later, another notable event happened in the temple’s long history: Chinese Emperor Kangxi’s visited here as a part of governing inspection.\n\nHow glad to see different ethnic groups could live harmoniously in one land throughout history. Although conflicts and wars had happened occasionally, the mixed ethnic culture memes would find their way to survive and left essences to the future generation.\n\nOne of the highlights of my Tibet trip was visiting the Potala Palace. Songtsen Gampo built this world wonder to marry Princess Wencheng from mainland China over 1,300 years ago. The Potala Palace was built on top of the mountain with more than 2,000 rooms full of paintings, books and exotic treasures.\n\nThe whole trip was mind-blowing with awe. Although human beings only existed in this universe for such a short period, the hard labour of creating those fantastic buildings and arts have always made me so emotional. ​​According to Tibetan Buddhist culture, if you circumambulate Mount Kailash clockwise on foot in the Year of Horse, it will bring good fortune because Mount Kailash is considered a home of Buddha Cakrasaṃvar, who represents supreme bliss; If you walk around Lake Namtso clockwise on foot in the Year of Sheep, it will bring buddha’ blessings because Lake Namtso is the holy lake in the Tibetan world.\n\n​The sixth Dalai Lama, Cang Yang Gyatso, once wrote a poem about his experiences walking around the mountain and the lake, “In this lifetime, circumambulating the mountains, the lake and stupas but not to seek rebirth, only to meet you along the way”. How romantic!\n\nI also wrote a piece to this beautiful land that blessed me with her beauty and holiness.\n\n告别西藏，难忘那白云朵朵蓝色静谧的天空，难忘那浪花淘淘绿色磅礴的江水，难忘那蓝白红绿黄代表天地五行的经幡，难忘那东西南北中虔诚扣头敬拜的教徒。\n\n布达拉宫依旧在旭日的照耀下璀璨生辉，藏香袅袅，佛音阵阵，美好一天又轮回，我在告别，你在守候，何日我们再相会？\n\nFarewell to Tibet, The Potala Palace shining brightly under the rising Sun.Farewell with the prayer flags with five pure lights.\n\nFarewell to Tibet, The Tibetan incense is curling up, Farewell to its white clouds, blue sky, and colourful lands.\n\nFarewell to Tibet, The Buddhist chanting is bursting out, Farewell to devoted people from the bottom of my heart.\n\nA beautiful day has come and gone. I’m saying goodbye. You are staying hereby. We are fated to meet again, Between the dark and dawn.​\n\n## Meditation Journey ​\n\nIf you’ve never tried it before, meditation can seem both improbable and pointless. You might wonder what the point is of sitting quietly for twenty minutes. It looks like a waste of time that doesn’t have any tangible benefits! But countless people and books talk about how important meditation is for your health, so I wondered: shall I give it a go and see what would work for me?\n\nIn 2018, after researching many different ways of meditation, I signed up for a **Transcendental Meditation (TM)** course, primarily influenced by [Ray Dalio](https://amzn.to/3drr07c), whose Principles was one of my favourite books. In this six-week course, my teacher taught me a mantra (he said everyone’s mantra is different. The mantra itself is meaningless, and it’s just an anchoring tool to help you focus). All I have to do is practice meditation for 20 minutes twice a day, once after waking up in the morning and once before dinner, in any setting or comfortable position.\n\n### How do I practise?\n\nFirst, choose a comfortable position, either sitting cross-legged or on a chair or sofa, as long as you are not lying down. Second, close your eyes and sit still for half a minute to a minute. When you feel relaxed, start repeating your mantra in your head. Your brain will generate many mixed thoughts at this time. The ideal state is when the mantra and the thoughts cease to exist, and a feeling of emptiness is achieved.\n\nAs it is written in the biography of [Steve Jobs,](https://amzn.to/3m8slUw) *“If you just sit and observe, you will see how restless your mind is. If you try to calm it, it only makes things worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there’s room to hear more subtle things — that’s when your intuition starts to blossom, and you start to see things more clearly and be in the present more. Your mind just slows down, and you see a tremendous expanse at the moment. You see so much more than you could see before. It’s a discipline; you have to practice it.”* I totally agree. The important part is **not controlling your thoughts but letting them go without interruption.**\n\nIt takes time but is worth it.\n\n### Yoga and Meditation Retreats\n\nOnce a year, I took a couple of weeks to do a **Yoga or Meditation retreat**. In 2019, I joined the Blooming Lotus Yoga retreat in Bali, including daily morning and evening yoga classes, theoretical study of the yoga system, daily morning and evening meditation sessions, and Bali’s cultural tour.\n\nAs an amateur CrossFit girl, I always find yoga too soothing and soft. I prefer to pump and punch in the gym or go to a HIIT class, making me feel like exercising. This seven-day intensive yoga training has changed my perspective on yoga classes in a fundamental way. I had a chance to learn Yin and Yang yoga. One is slightly faster, fluid, energetic and powerful; the other is softer, focusing on stretching and emphasising the endurance to achieve a state of unity between body and mind.\n\nYoga is not just a form of exercise but a way of life that unites body, mind and spirit, dating back 5,000 years to the Indus Valley. It has evolved over the millennia into many schools of thought, from the classical five major systems (wisdom yoga, karma yoga, hatha yoga, king yoga, kundalini yoga) and the eight branches of practice (abstinence, practice, asana, pranayama, mindfulness, concentration, meditation and samadhi) to the countless variations in modern society (hot yoga, Iyengar yoga, etc.).\n\nThe instructor briefly introduced us to Yoga Nidra, Chakras, Ayurveda and the yogic philosophy of ‘Unity of the Self’, and highlighted how to apply this theoretical knowledge to practical life by adopting healthy eating and exercise habits, self-healing and achieving a state of inner peace through a series of daily rituals. The most exciting part for me was the sister of Yoga: Ayurveda, derived from the Sanskrit word ‘life science’ with 5,000 years of history (Chinese medicine is also derived from Ayurveda).\n\nAyurveda believes that everything in the universe is made up of the five elements: Air (Akash), Wind (Vayu), Earth (Prithvi), Fire (Tejas) and Water (Apa), and the same is true of the human body (the five elements of Chinese medicine). These five elements are mixed to form Doshas’s life energy and are divided into three main categories.\n\nVata = Air + Wind\n\nPitta = Fire + Water\n\nKapha = Earth + Water\n\nThe Ayurvedic system teaches people to look within, understand themselves from the inside out, and find out what makes ‘themselves’. The essence of Ayurveda is to **find, discover and regulate your own sense of balance, to live in harmony with yourself, with others and with everything in the world.** No one can give more than what they have, which is why you must first start loving yourself. Be less obsessive with perfectionism and focus more on caring for yourself.\n\nThe most noticeable change since I started meditating is that I have become more aware of my ‘thoughts’ and many things I thought I had forgotten. Also, the emotions I had previously hidden and suppressed have come out (it can be horrifying at the beginning few months of practising meditation because you have to confront those ugly things that you avoided before).\n\n[Sigmund Freud](https://amzn.to/3rDamqn) once said, **“unexpressed emotions will never die. They are buried alive and will come forth later in uglier ways.”** No wonder I went through a couple of panic attacks in the past years --- my repressed emotions eventually reached their breaking point and suddenly attacked me.\n\nWith the help of meditation, I have more courage to face these deeply buried thoughts and feelings, which, although painful, are temporary, and when they are resolved one by one, I will no longer be disturbed by them and will have a clear-thinking mind.\n\nMeditation, like most things, is a long-term process, and just as the body needs to keep exercising to build muscle, the brain needs to keep meditating to develop awareness. Once you can be aware of yourself rather than follow the crowd, you’ll better understand who you really are and what you really want. And once this fundamental problem has been solved, other secondary issues that arise from a lack of clarity about ‘who you are’ will cease to exist.\n\n### Digital Detox Retreat\n\nDue to my work’s nature, I am always on my phone or in front of my computer, swiping through various social media platforms at all times, and actively/passively receiving a lot of fragmented information. Because of the fragmented knowledge in my head, I cannot focus and am easily affected by all kinds of redundant and cluttered information whenever I am thinking about complex issues. I constantly feel tired and less productive.\n\nIn 2018, I got a chance to check out a digital detox retreat in Auckland. It’s an excellent excuse for me to get away from the screen, be alone with myself and reflect on myself. In those three days, I didn’t touch any of my electronic devices. Each morning, I woke up naturally and practised two full meditation sessions, including 10-15 minutes of yoga, 5 minutes of breathing exercises, 20 minutes of Transcendental Meditation, resting in bed for the last 10 minutes and then repeating the above set of movements.\n\nThe rest of the day was writing journals, reading books, going out, and talking with other participants. I remembered one day I was sitting on my balcony and meditating. The Sun was shining brightly before I closed my eyes. When I woke up from the half-hour-long meditation, it was drizzling outside, and a little bird standing on my balcony, singing freely.\n\nIt reminds me of the time I watched the movie *Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.* The heroine saw a deer strolling on the green grass under the billboard, with the sunray in the backdrop. The heroine could not help but talk to the deer about her love for her daughter, and she returned to nature and faced the soft part of her heart. I shared the same feeling, appreciating nature’s beauty with gratitude.​\n\n## Psychedelic Experience\n\nIn 2021, I had my first psychedelic experience with the Grandfather plant, San Pedro, at [The Lighthouse Retreat](https://lighthouseretreats.co.uk/).\n\n2 trips in 4 days let me ‘saw’ the themes constantly haunted my mind: **time, space, reality and dream**. We all know language could be limited when you try to describe something overpowering magnificent. Here is my attempt to describe those visions and insights:​\n\nEighty-four thousand thoughts and ideas,\n\nLandscape transformation in the whirligig of time,\n\nEverything is evolving and decaying in front of my eyes.​\n\nVivid Colours dancing along with the music of nature,\n\nInfinite fractals emerging and disappearing like the Mandelbrot set and Mandala of Sanskrit.\n\nVan Gogh’s painting in a tangible form.​\n\nRam Dass’s message comes into my mind,\n\n“We’re all just walking each other home”.\n\nWe are nameless and formless,\n\nWe are a pixel and we are a Buddha,\n\nWas vernünftig ist, das ist wirklich,\n\nWe’re loved just for being who we are, just for existing.​\n\nLet’s accept ourselves and others in full,\n\nTry not to control, try not to force, try to surrender to the power of the universe.\n\nTime and space are a total illusion.\n\nThe reality doesn’t seem like what we see.\n\nTo see beauty, use our heart, not our eyes.\n\nFeel, and we shall know.\n\nSeek, and we shall find.​\n\nI rise above the earth and travel through abstract concepts and patterns.\n\nA snap of the finger is the moment of eternity.\n\nI could have lived forever in that dazzling and wonderful dream,\n\nBut your sweet smile pulls me back to the material world.​\n\nRemember, remember,\n\nLife is the eighth wonder.\n\nWhen we genuinely want something,\n\nThe whole universe is always on our side.\n\n​P.S. My teacher Isher at the retreat centre gave me the nickname “Zen Master” because I could sit on the platform for hours, calm and still. He mentioned my peaceful energy would help to balance unstable emotions from others.\n\nApart from the above experience, I do fully echo with what Steve Jobs once said, “*You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future”.*\n\nEverything that happened in my life has already connected in a beautiful circle. What I need to do is just follow my intuition and walk through the journey with love. Thanks to Grandpa San Pedro! See you soon, Grandma Ayahuasca!​\n\nP.P.S. I was astonished when I found Mandala flowers at the retreat centre! When I studied Buddhism at an early age, I named myself Mandala, and after two decades, I finally met ‘myself’ again.\n\n## Ultimate Goal  ​\n\nLast but not least, my grandpa left a poem to my family before dying in 2009.\n\nHe was a lifelong learner and independent thinker with intellectual curiosity on many subjects. Although he went through numerous ups and downs in his lifetime, he chose to have an innocent heart with a peaceful mind.\n\nI hope one day I could reach the same level as what he called oneness between me and the universe.​​\n\n![My grandpa Qi Kaimin's poem](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JYi1VRrCbImDdpKHVTlal.jpeg?height=827&width=639)\n\n《静坐吟》\n\n流光荏苒去无踪，\n\n富贵如云过眼空。\n\n淡泊生涯游物外，\n\n超然世俗学禅宗。\n\n阴阳和化情缘净，\n\n动静参修性意通。\n\n精气相乘神内守，\n\n天人合一九霄中。 ​​​​\n\n​Meditation\n\nThe light of the day is gone without a trace,\n\nWealth and fame are like clouds passing by.\n\nI am a simple person living a life outside of the material world,\n\nAnd I have studied Zen from the journey within.\n\nYin and Yang harmonise and purify my emotions,\n\nMoving and meditating cultivated my mind.\n\nThe essence of the spirit is my inner guard,\n\nThe universe and I unified in one.\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=295](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=295)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635925242, "digest": "goEs88Y0eo6SuQ1fp8TCQLMFI7X7HICINBtS_zYiH2o", "contributor": "0x6902E5CAf41158d3eD516cBd6D2807BB63863F42"}

{"id": "OngKc-9sR1nl6OHleYcA9GMqVCw9xb8PYc57-EF3SDY", "title": "头像NFT进化论：从收藏到社交，从Airdrop到发行Token", "body": "> 撰文：律动研究院-NFT Labs\n\n最近，大多数头像类 NFT 项目都在自己的路线图中加入了「发行 Token」这一玩法，而伴随而来的是更多的炒作以及人们的不解。\n\n更多的炒作是因为人们发现持有这类 NFT 每天都可以领取到相应数额的 Token，自己的回本周期被大大缩短，而且最终收入会变得更高；人们的不解在于透过炒作的泡沫来看，这些 Token 似乎大多数都没有价值，只不过是一些项目方在蹭热度，将近期最流行的玩法搬运到自己的路线图中而已。\n\n这些 Token 真的毫无价值吗？它们背后的含义究竟是什么？\n\n想要搞清楚这个问题，让我们先从 NFT 热潮刚刚来临的时候说起。\n\n### 从「收藏品」到「社交资本」\n\n这一次 NFT 头像的狂热最早可以追溯到 2021 年第二季度初，那是 Bored Ape Yacht Club 的爆火让人们开始用一种新的视角来看待 NFT。\n\n在此之前，无论是 CryptoPunks、Hashmasks 还是 NBA Top Shot，人们都将其视作「收藏品」。人们推崇 CryptoPunks 是因为它的历史地位，追捧 Hashmasks 是因为它的艺术性和共创精神，痴迷 NBA Top Shot 是因为在人们的共识里它是数字版的「球星卡」。\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club 的爆火在一开始让人们摸不着头脑，在当时它没有很重要的历史地位、没有极具艺术性的设计，更没有在现实世界中可以与之对应的收藏品。很多人说 BAYC 就是空气，而这些「空气」也迫使人们重新思考：NFT 除了可以是「收藏品」，它还可以是什么？\n\n随后出现的事件是人们把各种社交媒体的头像换成了猴子，之后便是大批猴子头像使用者的互相关注、点赞、转发与评论，这些「猴子」开始组建起了一个个小社群，随后因为在社交媒体「成群结队」导致影响力逐渐扩大，开始有一些名人也加入了这个队伍，社群规模也与日俱增。\n\n嗅觉敏锐的人们开始意识到，这些 NFT 已经成为了「社交资本」。而在那时「社交资本」有以下功能。\n\n首先是对于财富的炫耀。虽然可能在你买入 BAYC 时，它的地板价只有 0.2 ETH，但当它涨到 50 ETH 时，你把它用作头像实际上是在告诉大家你现在拥有价值 20 万美元左右的资产；又或者你是在 50 ETH 买入的 BAYC，把它当作头像时实际上是在告诉大家一个 jpg 头像「只」花掉了你的 20 万美元而已。\n\n其次便是对于社会地位与圈层的炫耀。如上文所说，社会各界名流纷纷买入 BAYC 并加入到 BAYC 的社群中，如果你也拥有一个 BAYC，那么你和这些名人就同属于一个圈层与社群。现实生活中每一个人都有自己喜爱的明星或尊崇的名人，而与他们同属一个圈层就成为了一个很有吸引力也很值得炫耀的事情了。\n\n那时「社交资本」的功能是以「炫耀」为基础的，而炫耀的最常见的方式便是「展示」。因此，早期的头像类 NFT 大多数都会为持有者 Airdrop 另外一个 NFT，这些 NFT 没有什么实际功能，只是人们又可以发在社交媒体中进行展示而已，比如 BAYC 向所有持有者 Airdrop 的一只狗。\n\n可以说在那时虽然人们发掘了 NFT 作为「社交资本」的用途，但是人们还是用「收藏者」的视角来看待 NFT，仍然把它当作是可以拿来炫耀、展示的东西。\n\n### 从「炫耀」到「社区冷启动」\n\n过去人们常说「Crypto 一日，人间一年。」，现在这句话已经变成了「NFT 一日，Crypto 一年。」。\n\nNFT 项目玩法的创新与更迭的速度令人瞠目，此时，NFT 的「社交资本」属性也开始有了除了炫耀之外的价值。\n\n此时的 NFT 不再只是用来炫耀的收藏品，而是成为了社区冷启动的工具。\n\n作为社区冷启动工具最为有趣也最极端的例子，Loot 充分展示了 NFT 在聚集社区这一方面的潜力，虽然 Loot NFT 的外观只是最简单的黑底白字，但它可以在极短的时间内凝聚起一个大社区，并让大部分社区成员投身于社区的建设当中。这时，人们购买 Loot NFT 或是投身于 Loot 社区建设并不是因为 NFT 的样式，而是因为人们相信 Loot 和社区未来的发展。\n\n人们对于 NFT 的外观越来越不重视，审美因素也不再是左右人们买入某个 NFT 的决定性因素，人们也不再只把「社交资本」用于炫耀，人们看待 NFT 的视角从「收藏者」变成了「投资者」。\n\n而在「投资」时，人们往往会在「人」和「事」两方面对一个项目进行深入研究。\n\n「人」指的是社区与名人。人们会关注一个项目的社区是否具有活力，有多少人真正愿意为了一个社区的发展而付出，社区中有没有一些有影响力的名人。名人一是指社交媒体的 KOL，二是指知名项目的创始人，三是指知名项目的藏家社区。\n\n他们相同点是都具有强大的粉丝基础，粉丝们会去支持他们所支持的项目；此外，他们也投资或创造过优质的项目，因此很多人会相信他们能够慧眼识珠；另一个原因是他们往往有较为充足的资金准备，既不急需变卖 NFT 来获取流动资金，又有潜在的「扫地板价」的可能。\n\n「事」指的是项目方发布的路线图，从路线图中人们可以看出项目方是否对于未来有着清晰的规划以及是否对于整个 NFT 领域有着深刻的见解。\n\n### 从 NFT Airdrop 到发行 Token\n\n头像类 NFT 项目热门玩法的变化在各个项目方路线图中体现得淋漓尽致。BAYC 带火了 NFT Airdrop，之后是众多项目在路线图中加入了对于未来元宇宙的规划，再之后是 CyberKongz 教科书级别的操作。除了繁育、体素版本 NFT Airdrop 之外，CyberKongz 让各个项目方纷纷开始发行自己的 Token。\n\n纵观如今市场中的 NFT 项目，它们发行的 Token 不外乎两种用途。\n\n第一是充当自己生态的货币。\n\n如今，NFT 项目大多数都对未来有着较为清晰且宏大的规划，比如推出 Play to Earn 游戏、建设元宇宙等等，正如前文所讲的那样，NFT 已经不仅仅是一个「收藏品」，而是「冷启动的工具」，发售只是第一步，更重要的是对未来的规划以及对于自己生态的建设。\n\n对于生态来说，经济体系的支撑与生态闭环的打造是十分重要的，因此项目方会给自己的 Token 充分赋能，以 CyberKongz 为例，其代币 BANANA 可以用来为 NFT 改名、繁育 Baby CyberKongz，未来还将推出只能用 BANANA 代币购买的 NFT 商店。\n\n第二是用来分享收益。\n\n近日，众多项目以发售 NFT 作为冷启动成立了投资 DAO，NFT 持有者组成一个去中心化自治组织，用发售 NFT 的收入作为启动资金，投票决定买入哪些蓝筹 NFT，之后发行 Token 用来代表社区金库的所有权，社区交易 NFT 的收益也将按比例分成。\n\n以 HeadDAO 为例，HeadDAO 项目方完成 NFT 发售后便开始采购蓝筹 NFT，通过在社区发起提案并由所有 NFT 持有者在 Snapshot 投票决定，买入了 CryptoPunk、BAYC、Cool Cat、Art Blocks Fidenza 系列等高价值蓝筹 NFT。随后 HeadDAO 将这些 NFT 通过 Fraction 平台进行碎片化，并将碎片化所得 HEAD Token 作为 NFT 持有者的质押奖励进行发放。\n\n不过目前一众项目方把发行 Token 当成了拯救自己项目的一步棋，但结果往往不尽如人意，一个失败的项目即使宣布发行 Token 也只会短暂地「回光返照」，热度过后又会迅速降温，最终无人问津，而这个过程在飞速发展的 NFT 世界中有时只需要几个小时。而这也让很多人给 NFT 项目发行的 Token 打上了「空气」、「泡沫」的标签。\n\n至此，让我们再来回顾一下文章开头提出的问题：这些 Token 真的毫无价值吗？它们背后的含义究竟是什么？\n\n### Proof of Holding：从 NFT 中解放流动性\n\n与各种 PoS、PoW 的 Token 一样，这些 Token 从本质上来说也是一种 Proof（证明），那么，它所证明的是什么呢？\n\n不难发现，无论是像 CyberKongz 那样持有 NFT 即可获得 BANANA Token，还是像 HeadDAO 那样将 NFT 质押后获得 HEAD Token，这些 Token 的获得者都是 NFT 的持有者，可以说这些 Token 是「持有证明」，我们不妨简称为「PoH（Proof of Holding）」。\n\n在各个 NFT 社区中都可以将人们大致分为两类：投机者（Flipper）和钻石手（Diamond Hands）。\n\n投机者（Flipper）是指为了在短期赚钱而来，价格上涨一些之后就会立刻将 NFT 卖掉，把「浮盈」装进口袋，从某种角度来说，他们为项目提供了流动性，决定了这个项目的下限；而钻石手（Diamond Hands）则是更加看重长期收益甚至不为了获得经济上的收益，因此会长期持有某个 NFT，而他们为项目创造了稀缺性，决定了这个项目的上限。\n\n一个项目想要长远发展，需要在稳住下限的情况下不断突破上限，这就需要鼓励人们去 Hold。但这又面临着一个新的问题。\n\n对于大多数人来说，资金的流动性是十分重要的。做一个投机者，人们可以在短期套利并能及时拿回流动资金；但是做一个钻石手，人们的资金相当于被长时间锁定，缺少流动资金可能会让人们错过很多的机会。\n\n因此，想要「提高上限」则需要将流动性从 NFT 中「释放」出来，发行 Token 是最好的选择。通过给每一个持有者发放 ERC-20 Token，一方面可以鼓励人们持有以获得更多 Token，另一方面是 ERC-20 Token 可以卖出获得人们所需的流动资金。项目方后续也可以推出流动性挖矿等方式鼓励用户自行添加流动性池以获得更多奖励。\n\n当我们明白这些 Token 是「持有证明」之后，NFT 领域又有了更多新的想象空间。\n\n举一个最简单的例子。现如今，各个项目方举办活动发放 Airdrop 奖励时，都采取了对 NFT 的持有地址进行快照的方式来将奖励发放给「持有者」，但是快照中的「持有者」是真正支持了这个项目的人吗？ \n \n\n诚然，这种方式有机会在短时间内快速拉升 NFT 的地板价，但这并不能保证拿到奖励的是真正的支持者。我们见到过太多发放完 Airdrop 地板价就立刻暴跌的项目，由此我们可以看出有不少人是为了拿到 Airdrop 才去买了这个项目的 NFT。\n\n快照所证明的是在那一刻你是否拥有某个 NFT，但项目方需要奖励的是在某个时间段长期持有某个 NFT 的用户，而作为「持有证明」的 Token 则可以很好地承担起这一功能。\n\n除此之外，很多 NFT 社区都将 NFT 用于治理投票，但这种方式缺少区分度，长期为社区作出贡献的人们理应拥有更大的权重，未来，项目方可以将持有 Token 的数量作为治理投票权重的判定标准，让社区治理更加公允。\n\nNFT 处于飞速发展的阶段，未来一定还会有更多的新鲜玩法来不断地拓宽 NFT 的边界，而我们需要不断地学习与理解。我们不能一味地抨击头像类 NFT 项目方发行 Token 并不只是蹭热度或是奢求自己的项目能够起死回生，对于优质项目而言，这是能够让其不断突破上限、持续发展的关键，也为整个 NFT 领域创造出了更多的可能性。 \n\n**欢迎加入律动 BlockBeats 官方社群** \n

Despite the hype and the consensus among the crypto community that crypto-gaming is the future, we’ve encountered both nebulous explanations of its benefits and legitimate arguments by established gamers as to why it will not work. We want to address both and discuss through the lens of our personal experiences and frustrations with games symbolic of our 2000s childhoods, six reasons why crypto will change gaming. We hope to propose novel applications or ideas in each section and provide a brief overview of existing arguments.\n\nAs always, if you’ve enjoyed this article please follow us on Twitter @terry15chung and @stingrayL0.\n\nThis article builds on and is inspired by, “[Into the Void: Where Crypto Meets the Metaverse](https://metaversed.net/263f1ff8c13c455ea472f5689e01acaa)” - we credit sections 1, 2, and 3 to this article. If you would like a more comprehensive overview of pillars 1, 2, and 3, we highly suggest reading this article first. Our [previous work on Axie](https://blockchain.mirror.xyz/sJzrBcsV-R700iMZ72hQeCrHgC_8NqT4senqCFXJRPg) also touches on this as well - check out the section titled “It's Just a Game”.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n* Definitions and Background\n* Pillar 1: Asset Ownership\n* Pillar 2: Transactions and Payments\n* Pillar 3: Interoperability\n* Pillar 4: Game Governance\n* Pillar 5: Reward Contributors\n* Pillar 6: Open Source\n* Redefining the Future of Work?\n\n## Tl;dr\n\n**Pillar 1: Asset Ownership**\n\n* NFTs allow you to keep in-game items even if the game shuts down\n* Self-custody means you can use it in other interoperable projects\n* NFTs can represent rights to access a game + other perks that give new monetization models to game devs\n* NFTs tell a story through the provable history of ownership that can make gameplay more immersive.\n\n**Pillar 2: Transactions and Payments**\n\n* Trustless marketplaces distribute margin from large marketplaces and sellers to individual sellers\n* RMT without fear of fraud.\n\n**Pillar 3: Interoperability**\n\n* Content and tokens can be interoperable - NFTs in one game can have representation in others.\n\n**Pillar 4: Game Governance**\n\n* Games allow provable on-chain proof of participation\n* This allows the creation of new governance models that address the issues with coin-voting, that make tradeoffs between Sybil resistance and plutocracy\n* This proof of participation model can be tweaked to solve for gerontocracy or account buying (more on this model later).\n\n**Pillar 5: Reward Contributors**\n\n* With crypto, we can now reward contributors with currency native to the game.\n* This is also important in rewarding developers, marketers, and other contributors to the protocol if the game is fully decentralized.\n\n**Pillar 6: Open Source**\n\n* Because blockchain games are open source, they can be forked to return to previous versions\n* This, combined with decentralized game governance allows organic dissipation of the incessant pressure to update for game developers.\n\n**Redefining the Future of Work?**\n\n* Through having a global system that is not disadvantageous to smaller players, we can provide meaningful wages to those who satisfy the demand for in-game currency or assets\n* Crypto-gaming can help alleviate the geographical lottery in ways that even working in regional software businesses cannot\n* Finally, we hope that there isn’t an over-finalization of gaming as the ultimate purpose is still to have fun. We should use NFTs and crypto to add immersion and never forget that the end goal is to build enjoyable consumer experiences.\n\n**Background:**\n\nWe want to start by first clarifying the differences between how we will use the terms “NFT Gaming”, and “Blockchain Gaming”.\n\nNFT Games have in-game assets that are NFTs. Just because a game incorporates NFTs, does not necessarily mean its game logic runs on a blockchain, or that it is decentralized. Similarly, games could decide to issue tokens and decentralize but omit NFTs altogether.\n\n“Blockchain games” host their game logic directly on public blockchains. Congruently, it does not have to incorporate NFTs or have a crypto-currency tied to the ecosystem (you get the point).\n\nWe will refer to games that use any blockchain technology as “crypto-games”.\n\nNote: Because this space is so new, our general definitions will probably have changed by this time next year. NFTs are social by nature, so our discussion focuses exclusively on multiplayer games.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Pillar 1: Asset Ownership\n\n2008 - I had just made some friends after moving to a new school. A bunch of us boys was hanging out in front of my best friend’s computer during a sleepover where we came across...\n\n![“Looks fun - could use a break from Age of Empires 2”](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pQLA5hGzOfiVrebzA08KB.jpg?height=379&width=500)\n\nBy 2010 we were still throwing snowballs at the basketball hoop as we complained about our homework that day. We had our Secret Agent Badge and Black Belt proudly equipped for all to see. Hanging out in Club Penguin was definitely a highlight of my lower-school years.\n\nEarly 2017, I had just found out that Club Penguin was shutting down a month later (March 2017). So my friends and I logged in one last time to shoot some snowballs at the basketball court while we threatened to report anyone who dared try to type “Idiot” with our Special Agent privileges.\n\n### Losing Games and Game Items\n\nWhether it’s a mount in WoW or my Puffle and igloo in Club Penguin losing in game-assets is an upsetting experience that is, unfortunately, the fact of life. Whether it’s the dozens of Reddit pages and forums, there are people frustrated with losing items in their games or MMOs [that have closed down over the years](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2021/09/best-mmos-shut-down-online/). Losing something they spent so much time, effort, and money to acquire. This is especially true in the case of MMORPGs, where people built whole identities and communities around their account, only for those to disappear when the game became unprofitable to maintain for the studio.\n\n![:(](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ci-6N94UQGDzUN8vsePEx.PNG?height=237&width=738)\n\nHere's an example of the unthinkable becoming reality: an MMO that [disappeared overnight.](https://www.engadget.com/2011-11-15-hangame-mmo-accidentally-deleted-shut-down-forever.html)\n\n### So How Does Crypto Help?\n\nIf my Puffle or Penguin avatar had been an NFT, it could exist independently of whether Disney shuts Club Penguin down or not. If other games or individual users so desired, these NFTs could still have use-cases (see Pillar 3, 6) from user spun-up derivative games/experiences.\n\nTo better understand this dynamic and why it is important (past your experience with Club Penguin) check out “[Into the Void: Where Crypto Meets the Open Metaverse.](https://metaversed.net/263f1ff8c13c455ea472f5689e01acaa)”\n\nIn this section, we want to build on the article above to muse about additional use-cases on how in-game asset ownership can transform gaming.\n\n### Buying and Selling of Games (Again)\n\nAccessing games through a DRM (Digital Rights Management) platform like Steam or Microsoft Store means you get a license to play games through their server. [You don’t actually own the game.](https://www.techradar.com/news/pc-game-ownership-in-the-digital-age-what-do-you-do-in-a-post-ownership-age)\n\nI remember the good old days when I traded my Smash Bros for a Blazing Angels CD. Every CD and cartridge that my friends had, was also another game I had access to - when we were bored of playing one game, we were happy to sell, swap, and gift it to each other.\n\n[https://twitter.com/jking215/status/1450444140072865794?s=25](https://twitter.com/jking215/status/1450444140072865794?s=25)\n\nToday, I have over 120 games on Steam, and I have no idea what to do with them. I can't sell, lease or gift them on a game-by-game basis nor can I sell my Steam account since it contains sensitive personal information and breaks TOS (terms of service). And frankly, there is a level of confusion about having just “purchased” something and being told that I cannot do anything with it past playing the game; [it seems like we aren’t the only ones following this train of logic.](https://www.vg247.com/steam-users-right-to-sell-games-french-court-valve-ruling)\n\nYet Steam can’t put it more directly that you *do not* in fact own the game. [From Steam’s TOS:](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/)\n\n> Valve hereby grants, and you accept, a non-exclusive license and right, to use the Content and Services for your personal, non-commercial use…\n>\n> All title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in and to the Content and Services and any and all copies thereof are **owned by Valve…**\n>\n> You are entitled to use the Content and Services for your own personal use, but **you are not entitled to (i) sell, grant a security interest in, or transfer reproductions** of the Content and Services to other parties in any way, **nor to rent, lease or license the Content and Services to others…**\n\nInstead of digital licenses, NFTs could be used to authenticate access to a game. This is already the case for Axie Infinity, where you must own 3 Axies to play. You’re then allowed to sell, gift, breed…etc those Axies anytime you wish. This now means that you can resell access to your old games, buy games on the secondary market, and lend/rent access to games through NFT renting protocols like [reNFT](https://www.renft.io/).\n\nSo perhaps before you purchase a game you want to try playing it for a while, or you’re finally finished with a game and want to resell it at market prices. Perhaps you want to create social communities around verified ownership of some game, or even guilds with requirements of verification of on-chain data about your in-game status (levels, land-possession, faction allegiance...etc). **With NFTs representing in-game assets, or replacing digital licenses, you unlock a richer user experience around gaming.**\n\n### But what about the Game Developers\n\nIf everyone could just buy/sell/trade their games with someone else, then how are they going to make money?\n\nFirst, NFTs can create new monetization models. Game developers can embed NFTs with a royalty fee so that each time in-game assets get traded, they (or a designated address - a treasury) automatically receive the fees. The same idea applies if the NFT assets represent ownership of the game itself. Axie relies on this model and is one of the top revenue-generating games of 2021.\n\n[https://twitter.com/santiagoroel/status/1442496732458221581](https://twitter.com/santiagoroel/status/1442496732458221581)\n\nFurthermore, game developers can offer additional interoperable experiences, lowering the cost barrier for new players while increasing price discrimination. Imagine a game studio that has developed a large game and many mini-games that all can be played entirely independently of each other. These games are related and are all part of a core story/game universe. Purchasing NFT A could allow players to access A mini-game, but they must buy NFT B if they want to access the B mini-game...etc. If they decide that they like what they’re playing, then they could buy the more expensive NFT Z. The different NFTs that I now own can now act as either unique characters, passes to enter certain areas in the big game, or be combined/composed into unique items while still providing access to the different minigames that are part of the same core universe.\n\nThe difference between this and the current DLC model is that each NFT is independent of one another. If the area that A NFT unlocks in the main game is no longer interesting to a player, they could sell that NFT individually. Or if they no longer have the time to play games, they could sell everything except for NFT A which to them is the most fun and least time-consuming.\n\nThese NFTs also don’t have to be as expensive as DLCs or purchasing games today. With new post-purchase monetization models available to game studios, initial purchase prices could be even lower than DLCs today.\n\n### Capturing Value\n\nWhat is valuable in a game?\n\nPerhaps it's “whatever lets us have the most fun”, but with that, we turn into the realm of subjectivity. A gorgeous-looking sword with mediocre stats may be welcomed by a more aesthetically conscious player but frowned upon by a stat-only player who wants the best gear.\n\n![Classic Dilemma](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EJsgjt_WY8j1UAKhIJeFE.jpg?height=480&width=640)\n\nWe conjecture that with in-game items the 4 main factors that contribute to “what is valuable” are authenticity, scarcity, utility, and story.\n\nAuthenticity, utility, and scarcity are generally well captured in the current gaming environment. If you know that a legendary item is super powerful, has a low drop rate, and is useful to you, you probably spend a lot of effort obtaining it and purchasing it at a high price, and because games today are closed environments, the question of authenticity is trivial.\n\nHowever, the value of the story, in our opinion, isn’t captured well at all. For example, when you buy an art piece, the curator can usually provide historical background on the piece, like whether its previous owner was someone famous, a crazy story of how it was rediscovered, or a story behind its creation. These stories are what sometimes make art valuable and engaging - when you purchase a piece, you aren’t just buying its visual representation, but its historical context (where and how it was made), its lineage (which walls it has hung on), and its overall story.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_DRNbpsU3Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_DRNbpsU3Q)\n\n**Unfortunately, stories like this are rarely captured in in-game assets on a noticeable level, which we believe is a massive missed opportunity.** Imagine how valuable it would be for some hardcore fans of Hiko to find out they were buying was the exact StatTrak P2000 Corticera skin he used to execute the [inhuman reaction headshot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFGpLdGEL9k) But more importantly imagine the level of immersion this can bring into gameplay - the level of pride at owning the exact skin used by Faker, the exact whip used by Durial321 during the Fally massacre (this point is expanded upon in Pillar 5). **Because the history of ownership is easily verifiable, items take on a story and a lineage, increasing its value but also creating more immersive experiences in gameplay.**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acKvztQu8Zg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acKvztQu8Zg)\n\nAn example of the power of story in creating immersive experiences around gaming: the Runescape Party Hat - “one of the most iconic items in the history of modern video games”\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Pillar 2: Transactions and Payments\n\nBesides ownership of in-game assets, the ability to transact trustlessly on blockchain infrastructure could be a solution for problems that revolve around gray markets and RMT [(Real Money Trading)](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/privacy-2/2021/09/gamers-beware-the-risks-of-real-money-trading-rmt-explained/). As presented in “[Into the Void](https://metaversed.net/263f1ff8c13c455ea472f5689e01acaa)” we assume RMT to be an inevitable byproduct of demand for in-game assets and build off that assumption.\n\n### Distribute Margin\n\nThe CSGO skin trade is a multi-billion dollar market that lacks transparency despite its popularity, size, and efforts to regulate it. The market isn’t the wild wild west anymore compared to pre-2018 thanks to greater oversight and regulation from Valve, but there still are plenty of fishy[ third-party sites](https://gist.github.com/MRuy/a3a64bc870a320864557) that are made to scam unaware buyers.\n\n![CSGOSkins](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_MlSl1Z2fIWbu64TOAyFI.png?height=601&width=1164)\n\nA safer bet would be to trade on the Steam Marketplace, which is far more secure and popular. However, Steam Wallet has a limit of $2,000 (so all trades cannot exceed it), a hefty 15% fee, and money gained from trading MUST stay in the Steam ecosystem. If you want to cash out to fiat or have an item(s) worth more than $2000 to sell, you would need to head back to those aforementioned third-party sites. And while many do offer legitimate trading services, the more legitimate they are, the higher fees they tend to command and the greater the likelihood you will need to complete KYC verification and link your account with Steam. What we see is a centralization to Steam’s marketplace and a select number of marketplaces that have high taxes and tactics to force you to stay in the Steam ecosystem.\n\nBecause blockchains already have developed infrastructure around secure transactions, marketplaces built atop public blockchains don’t need as much capital investment to maintain security. Hence, they’re able to distribute the margin they need to maintain profitability to the end-users, greatly lowering their take rate (marketplace fees on Opensea are 2.5%). Whereas in the past, Valve had to spend money validating transactions, responding to customer service requests, and building market infrastructure, public blockchains, and open source marketplace contracts already take care of all of these features (in fact just sell them on Opensea). Authenticity verification of NFTs is much easier via reading its metadata, restricting the possibility of scams by creating listing requirements on the platform.\n\nCrypto can also bring transparency to the RMT process. First, crypto-games by definition have adjacent marketplaces where buying and selling of in-game crypto assets take place. By accepting this as a feature of the game, the game can spin up its own marketplace and decrease player reliance on potentially fraudulent third-party websites. Second, through a listing mechanism where the product is automatically delivered upon receipt of payment, and/or through a DEX for in-game currency, crypto can enable better price discovery and trustless transactions.\n\nInterestingly, RMT sellers would also gain from adopting crypto. Current RMT sellers have to deal with credit card fraud, disputed charges, and merchant fees which take substantial chunks of their profits.\n\n### Dilution of Prestige\n\nA common criticism with embracing RMT is that it dilutes the amount of dedication a player put in to acquire a rare in-game asset if an RMTer could buy it at the click of a button. NFTs, via on-chain verifiable histories, make available to the public who it was that obtained (minted) the item. This can then act as social currency within the game.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Pillar 3: Interoperability\n\nBeyond the fact that the Smash Bros franchise is both a great party and competitive fighting game, we believe a factor in its immense success is how it allows characters from different franchises to interact. It’s in people’s nature to compare characters between different stories (Gandalf vs Dumbledore) and debate how a fight or interaction might shake out - to see it happen in-game satisfies that demand. People also find it fun when their favorite celebrities or fandoms collide and produce new content; scratching that ‘what if‘ scenario in the back of our heads. But because of our current gaming infrastructure, the majority of games are siloed in their own franchises and aren’t able to scratch that itch.\n\n![A well-visited screen](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-ZFFqnyWtZJfQUxBOt4rH.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\n### Content Interoperability\n\nGames like Smash Bros and Kingdom Hearts are in the minority. **We believe that players are missing out on a whole new way to experience their games with closed-end ecosystems while developers are missing out on new ways to monetize and promote their games.** Meanwhile, Fornite *has* realized this potential and is not afraid to take steps towards integrating other games/media outside of its universe, like the introduction of Kratos from the God of War franchise or John Wick as an example.\n\n![Fortnite](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4aOlt_g_AXKX0axrWcRG0.jpg?height=675&width=1080)\n\nNFTs can open the flood gates to interoperability between games. In so far as a game develops a representation of the NFT in their game, users will be able to integrate any NFT they desire. An NFT that represents a playable character or item in one game, could be a cosmetic skin or land in another. **Not every NFT will need to be playable or have representation in-game (this is infeasible due to cost and game-design issues), but the fact that one in-game item can exist in another even just as a cosmetic piece can be powerful in terms of the partnerships and hype it can bring.**\n\nBecause of the increased interoperability, players can also experience new ways to use the assets they own without needing to buy a new game. For example, if a Medieval MMORPG formed a partnership with a 5v5 NFT brawl game, the NFT character that I bought for the MMO could be used in the brawl game as well, effectively increasing my total playtime per item bought. Imagine the implications here for a game like Smash Bros.\n\nIt's exciting to see that these partnerships that will set the foundation of interoperability in NFT games are already being formed. [Wararena](https://www.warena.io/) and Iluvium’s [recent decision ](https://teamwarena.medium.com/warena-partners-with-illuvium-will-look-to-cross-metaverse-db17dd49533e)to form a partnership to solidify cross-compatibility is great, and we believe that the more games that are currently being developed with NFTs become interconnected, the sooner we can start building an open metaverse.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8SEavoH6ljSm7F98i8uOZ.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\n### Economic Interoperability\n\nAfter converting cash into V-bucks (Fortnite) or Steam wallet dollars, there currently is no way to withdraw it back to fiat, nor send it to another platform (assuming 2 weeks have passed for Steam Wallet). This is an intentional and effective method to keep players invested in their platform/game and not move their purchasing power elsewhere. In the [same article mentioned earlier](https://www.vg247.com/steam-users-right-to-sell-games-french-court-valve-ruling), the lawsuit brought on by the French consumer protection group against Steam also argues that the inability for people to withdraw their money from Steam is anti-consumer behavior. Even with gift cards, one can redeem the remaining balance to fiat assuming some conditions are met.\n\nWe believe there are many other benefits that having an interchangeable currency can bring; for example:\n\n* Players now actually have more control over their assets\n  * Withdraw to Fiat\n  * Transfer tokens to another player\n* Games that use the same tokens as an in-game currency could experience a higher level of user growth since players would be more inclined to try out a new game (and pay for things in it) if they already have the underlying token to play it\n* Game shutdowns won’t wipe out in-game currency, and other games could use existing currencies in any way they see fit\n* All of this effectively increases the utility of my in-game crypto-currency\n\nOne can imagine, once the Axie SDK is open source, new Axie game modes will create more use cases for SLP and increase Axie demand.\n\nAt the end of the day, the current system works, albeit in a non-ideal way. People are aware of the irreversibility of putting cash into their Steam wallet, and they still do it anyway. We just believe that there are more consumer and game-studio-friendly alternatives available with crypto.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Pillar 4: Game Governance\n\nI vividly remember opening up another tab on Internet Explorer to furtively chop willows or AFK salmon during computer class. This was 15 years ago, and I still play today.\n\n![And no I am not maxed...](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_Lt7jD2C7O2bgWYycpXyz.png?height=496&width=759)\n\n### Nostalgia\n\nThe golden age of Runescape was RS2 pre-EOC/post wildy + free trade. (For a quick recap, RS1 had old-school graphics and limited content, RS2 had an expansion of new skills, quests, and a deeper storyline, while RS3 had a new combat mechanic (EOC) and pay-to-win micropayments that caused a community schism.)  As with most games, simply by having existed long enough the dev team ended up shipping updates that were not well received by most of the community.\n\nPost EOC (in RS3) there was such a large exodus of players that the CEO of Jagex (the developing company behind the game) put out a community *[poll](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/2007---old-school-runescape-you-vote?jptg=ia&jptv=news_archive)*, a means to previously gauge player interest around updates, to determine whether Jagex should create a retro version of the game. If it received more than 50,000 votes the retro 2007 servers would be revived, and for each additional 250,000 votes it received, this “fork” would receive extra benefits and attention from the team.\n\nHere’s an in-depth explanation of the fork:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP-GQoO8hDU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP-GQoO8hDU)\n\nThe poll proceeded to pass with 440,000 votes spawning the creation of the now more popular OSRS (old school Runescape). As one of the promised benefits at the level of interest they received, the mods created an in-game polling system, where only paying members who had a **total level above 300 and more than 25 hours of game-time** would be able to vote on significant updates, new quests, cosmetics, and items. Only if the vote passed with more than 75% yes votes would the updates be implemented in-game. These polls are detailed, giving users the leeway to vote on the creation of new game modes, [cosmetics](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Poll:Design_A_Hat_Art_Competition_-_Finalists), and different [stats a game item possesses](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Poll:Equipment_Rebalance:_Ranged_Meta).\n\n![Poll Booth](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VSO-V5qDwevYxLXEP2bLd.png?height=288&width=511)\n\nThough widely supported by the community, this rollback also erased 6 years’ worth of content from 2007-2013. Today I would give anything to be able to go back to 2008 and finish “While Guthix Sleeps” on my original RS account, but alas the quest is now part of RS3, and my new OSRS character no longer has access to the quests I dreamt of completing in my childhood.\n\n### The Overarching Issue\n\nAll of these aforementioned issues stemmed from unilateral updates that the devs shipped without community input. We were members of a game without any say in how it progressed despite having sunk our time, money, and soul into it. Despite our willingness to do so, there was no way for users to contribute to further game development post-roll-back - to restore our favorite quests, or decide on which year to roll back the servers to.\n\n> I happily played World of Warcraft during 2007-2010, but one day Blizzard removed the damage component from my beloved warlock’s Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. I soon decided to quit. - Vitalik Buterin\n\nBut, at the end of the day, none of this is the core dev teams’ fault. They are under a catch-22 pressure, where unless there are new updates and content, players leave for newer pastures; but if there are too many updates, players grumble about balance and ruining the game. It is in their incentive structure to continue to ship updates at break-neck speeds. That is until one of the updates ends up as unpopular as EOC.\n\nAnd why restore to the 2007 version? - that was the only version that they could find that was [backed up in the company ](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:2007_-_Old_School_RuneScape..._You_Vote!)hard drive.\n\n### Issues with the Rollback / Voting System\n\nBy requiring that any update pass a plurality vote, OSRS gives the community the power to decide on how the game will progress. The polling system is by design conservative, making it unlikely that any large system altering update (like EOC) gets passed without scrutiny, and though voter participation is low, issues of particular interest (Group Ironman, adding new skills) do get much higher turnout than other polls (10% of player base or 2x DAU).\n\nAt the very least this can stop the degeneration of the game into an unrecognizable hodge-podge of overlapping updates. On the other hand, the plurality requirement and low voter turnout pit opinionated conservationists against people that want to see further developments in OSRS.\n\nThis opinionated minority effectively has the power to block all new updates that greatly alter the game. This puts people like me who valued RS2 in an odd position. We weren’t around to feel nostalgic and maximalist about preserving the classic nature of 2007 Runescape, yet we are also unwilling to go WoW in neighboring RS3. We want, and to this day fight for, a dynamically moving OSRS with our favorite quests, new items, and skills. Yet each successive time there is a vote to alter the 75% plurality requirement or updates that meaningfully alter the game, they are struck down by the minority.\n\nAn example of this conservative blocking power was in the failure of a new skill warding to pass the polls. Read about it briefly [here](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Warding). It failed with a yes vote of 66%, showing that a plurality requirement can create a static game.\n\nAnother disadvantage of the OSRS voting model is that it is prone to bot attacks (Sybil attacks). It’s easy for bots to create new accounts, and without detection, achieve 25 hours of gameplay plus a total level of 300. Though the ease of doing so decreases exponentially per hour played, (for example if the % likelihood of getting banned per hour of botting gameplay is 0.1%, then there is a 10% chance of getting banned in the first 100 hours) with current bot detection systems, it is more than likely that they can form a voting bloc that casts the deciding vote.\n\nRight now there is little incentive for RMTers and bot farmers to actively participate in the polls as most of the ballot items do not impact botting income, but if governance decisions had a direct impact on the price of associated tokens and items in-game then bot attacks become very costly.\n\n![A bot farm in the wildy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z9KX89GbOimwRasGihnw4.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nFinally, the OSRS model has no formal way for players to originate ideas. It has happened before that a popular forum post, filtered and edited by the devs, landed on a poll, but this is a rare occurrence.\n\n### Are NFT games able to Solve these problems?\n\nFrankly, we’re not sure! But we at least believe that the opportunity set of possible experiments is so vast that somewhere we will be able to find solutions to mitigate, if not solve these issues.\n\nThe pressure to constantly update will still exist but can be organically dissipated by community-driven content and decentralized governance. The exact version of the game the community desires can be retrieved at all times and run by any member that desires to do so, and more sophisticated polling systems than the one used by OSRS can be used/experimented with to target specific results.\n\n### Decentralized Governance\n\nFor a quick overview of what blockchain governance is check out this link. For a more in-depth introduction, we suggest the [Crypto Canon: Governance ](https://a16z.com/2018/02/10/crypto-readings-resources/)section.\n\nA reductive explanation would be that crypto-based communities, often organized around a particular project with its own token, are operated by governance systems where instead of a singular centralized entity making decisions (in this example think Jagex unilaterally pushing updates) there exists some form of voting or social consensus system among its users, community members and token holders. Within predefined bounds, changes to the protocol/application must pass a vote. Think about how in OSRS players that meet a certain threshold can vote for proposals that directly affect the game.\n\n### DeGov Unique to Crypto Games\n\nGaming, in particular, gives us access to primitives that allow the creation of new crypto-governance models. We hope to propose a rough blueprint of such a model that addresses issues within gaming and existing crypto-governance using unique qualities only available in games.\n\n### Existing Issues with Crypto-Governance\n\nThe predominant crypto-governance model is some form of coin-voting. Those who possess tokens can cast or delegate votes which are then weighed depending on the protocol’s governance specifications. Coin governance is prone to bribing, plutocracy and must implement additional measures to safeguard itself from predatory financial interests - quadratic voting being a prime example. It also fails to represent interests besides token holders. For a comprehensive overview check out Vitalik’s blog post - [Beyond Coin Governance](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html).\n\nAs mentioned in his article, a solution to the issues of coin-voting is non-coin-driven governance of which one branch - that doesn’t involve KYC - is “proof of participation”.\n\n> Proof of participation: systems that attest to the fact that some account corresponds to a person that has participated in some event, passed some educational training, or performed some useful work in the ecosystem. See POAP for one attempt to implement thus. - Vitalik\n\nIn existing protocols tangibly measuring proof of participation is a challenging issue. However, within a game, there are easily provable ways of verifying participation and subsequently weighing this participation.\n\n### Proof of Participation Voting Mechanisms\n\nOne immediate metric we can take as a proxy to participation is the total level of a character.\n\nFor instance, we could easily envision an extension of the OSRS model, where only members who have played more than X hours and have met certain leveling conditions get to vote and propose new items on the ballot.\n\nBut from there we could extend the voting mechanism with ideas brought over from coin-voting. The number of votes delegated to a user per voting round could scale at:\n\n```\n                          (X-S)^n\n```\n\nwhere x is the on-chain verifiable level, s is a phase shift that guarantees adequate Sybil resistance, and n is some constant (or piecewise changing), whereby the more total levels you have the more votes you earn, rewarding established players who verifiably have put time and effort into the game over newer users. With this simple model, we’ve engaged in a tradeoff between Sybil resistance in voting and plutocracy. **However for an optimized s and n, given a high enough % chance of being banned per time botted, we could minimize the effects of bot-attacks that sway key governance decisions, or at the very least cause it to be temporally infeasible for bot accounts to overcome actual user’s decisions**. The disadvantages of such a model would be that it could establish a gerontocracy as voting power pools in existing players which would incentivize account selling.  (Similar to this proof of playtime model is YGG’s token distribution model, where governance tokens are distributed to those who complete quests and contribute more to the community. We do not yet know how they will measure, verify contribution or decide on the number of rewards issued upon completion of those quests. Check their whitepaper [here](https://yieldguild.io/YGG-Whitepaper-English.pdf).)\n\n### Solving Gerontocracy\n\nTo prevent gerontocracy we could implement a voting power decay. Taking Runescape as an example for clarity, it could be that the first season of voting after you achieve 2000 total levels you receive x amount of votes, but every subsequent year x decays at a slow linear rate, removing the power of long-time incumbents and benefiting relatively newer users as they gain more experience. This is of course offset as the older players further advance within the game and earn more voting power through achieving new milestones. Once you reach the level limit this decay could stop, rewarding the highest achieving players.\n\n![An example of how voting power could scale with time](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7Z5SdnI_XiXupz4EqlcDJ.png?height=800&width=800)\n\n### Account Buying\n\nAs for large-scale account buying, we could implement the solution adopted by Axie Infinity. Because each character is an NFT with on-chain levels, we could easily have the level reset upon any transfer. (Axie progress resets upon each account transfer).\n\n![Consequence for Transfering](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FXIkJWTBkQBslDtGVcT61.PNG?height=318&width=466)\n\nAnother solution would be to make the NFT representing your playable account non-transferable. This would equate large-scale account buying to large-scale purchasing of private keys - entailing its own security and coordination costs. Because private keys are also unalterable, the seller can still access the account post-sale, further discouraging large-scale account buying. (We are currently working on an optimized version of the above model, testing different parameters to maximize Sybil resistance. Catch us in another post soon!)\n\n### Coin Voting + Proof of Playtime\n\nHaving established a proof-of-playtime voting system, we can combine it with existing coin-voting to give representation to overlapping but different constituencies. The weighing of these two votes could be ossified to outline the key governance values of the game. One can imagine a scenario where coin holders represent ⅓ of the voting power while proof of playtime voters control the rest, leading to the ability of coin-voters to sway important decisions, but not be the deciding factor in altering the game that the players invest their money, time and soul into.\n\n### Why not Off-chain?\n\nOne of the key reasons decentralized voting becomes necessary is that there can be times when the dev team (if there is a centralized team developing the game) and the community are in opposition to one another. With current games, besides the occasional dissatisfaction with an update, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. The community is the main source of revenue for the dev team, and alienating too many can come at the cost of their livelihood.\n\nHowever, one can imagine a blockchain game where the assets and tokens associated with it have become so valuable that despite the community’s desire in changing gameplay, it is in the best interest of the devs to preserve the value of their initial allocation over anything else.\n\nIf a governing proposal benefits the players at the expense of the token price, then a vote where correct execution is guaranteed and the votes and outcome cannot be tampered with by the team, is important.\n\nThough not immediately congruent, we can take a look at Axie Infinity, where the majority of scholar-players want some form of an Axie sink and higher SLP breeding requirements to raise the price of SLP, while it is in the team’s best interest to only marginally maintain acceptable yields and breeding profitability to increase the size of their player base.\n\n### Illuvium Improvement Proposal-4: A Case Study\n\nIlluvium is a current work-in-progress game that is positioning itself as the first AAA game to be built on IMX on Ethereum. It’s an open-world RPG, where players collect creatures (Illuvials) and use them to battle other players in an Auto-Chess game mode. This game is the first of its dev-size and popularity in the crypto space that has already implemented some form of decentralized governance. ILV holders get to vote for representatives on the Illuvium Council and delegate their vote to the person of their choice. Council members can then debate and vote on proposals submitted by token holders such as but not limited to:\n\n* Balance Changes\n* Expansion Packs\n* Character Sets\n* Monster Spawn Rates\n* Marketplace Fees\n\nAnd there are already early signs that the system can generate good results. A proposal was successfully passed to disallow locked tokens belonging to seed investors to qualify for staking rewards.\n\nThis change was to “substantially increase the APY of both pools, which will incentivize new users to purchase and stake ILV” and remove possibilities of “potentially harming the decentralization of the project”[ (the whole proposal).](https://github.com/IlluviumGame/IIPs/blob/master/iips/iip-4.md) This change was enacted to avoid plutocracy as stakers with locked tokens could also generate more ILV from yield farming, which would centralize their holdings and push smaller stakers and farmers out of the loop.\n\nThe passing of this proposal shows that the DAO can sacrifice short-term benefits for long-term objectives. It’s even more significant since it had a substantial (short-term) financial impact on the founding and then-current holders ILV, and the fact it reneged on some promises made to seed investors. It was a win for the longevity of the game, and I think the meteoric rise in the price of ILV since[ April ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/illuvium/)somewhat reflects that.\n\nI reached out to the person who suggested the change, and here is what he had to say:\n\n![Our Conversation on Discord](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ya0PW0jwJmMq5ZQhGivN9.PNG?height=452&width=1564&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=large)\n\n### So is it all worth it?\n\nShould the core community of players and stakeholders in a game be able to self-govern (self-originated ideas, vote) in a way that is less susceptible to bot attacks (than existing game governance) and plutocracy (than coin-voting) via implementing a proof of play-time mechanism?  Frankly, we’re not sure. We still don’t know if the mechanism can achieve adequate Sybil resistance, and how to implement a decentralized bot-banner.\n\nBut as we were writing this article, Riot Games’ unanimous decision to remove the /all chat (RIP 2009-2021) in patch 11.21 without ANY sort of warning to or consulting of the player base demonstrates the one-sided development of games. From general discussions, it seems while most people believe Riot came with good intentions, they have focused their energy entirely in the wrong place and are out of touch. Many believe that Riot should be focused on developing better software and features that detect the consistent bad actors (repeat AFKers, Trollers, Heavy Profanity Users, etc.) and implement more appropriate punishments accordingly while rewarding good behavior.\n\nWhile I’m sure making a comprehensive judicial system for the world’s most popular game isn’t easy, I also think the amount of time they’ve had surely would have been enough to come up with something better. In a decentralized system, I think players would have voted for the implementation of a better judicial system and malicious-behavior detection software a long time ago, and Riot games would have had to implement it, or at least not pull this nonsense of banning the beloved /all chat that solves basically nothing.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tttOFQdvB4_mEh1qY3-wr.png?height=238&width=523)\n\nEDIT: [Seems like Riot has heard the crowd (thankfully) last minute, the ban is now limited to certain regions with a 2 patch duration ](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/patch-11-21-notes/)to test the efficacy of the ban\n\nThere are large tradeoffs to community governance and a game controlled by its users may end up shipping developments at the whim of its community that ends up ruining the long-term prospects of the game anyways. But at the end of the day\n\n> “Democracy is the worst form of government – except for all the others that have been tried.”\n\nThis form of game development may be less fluid and tend toward conservatism, but it may turn out better than the benevolent dictatorship of a core dev team. At the very least we believe that given our history it is an experiment worth trying.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Pillar 5: Reward Contributors\n\n### Reward Gamers/Content Creators\n\nOne of the core advantages of having a coin is that the protocol has a native currency to reward constituencies and contributors in such a way that their incentives are aligned with the success of the protocol itself. **Earlier contributors obtain these rewards at a lower cost basis and take on a larger risk in participating in an unproven ecosystem.** The efforts they expend to grow bring in later participants, and the price of their tokens now appreciates to reflect the increased interest in the project.\n\nThis is the system implemented by Axie Infinity. Every season, the 1000 highest ranked players are eligible to claim progressively higher AXS rewards. The highest-ranked player for season 17 earned 225 AXS, which at the time of this writing is valued at 31,000USD. This creates a feedback loop where players increasingly strive to achieve higher rankings, thus experimenting with new builds, breeding, creating guides, making videos, teaching scholars...etc overall growing the ecosystem through monetary interest, all the while rewarding its most avid players, streamers and contributors.\n\n![Leaderboard Rewards](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AINHMuduoyA9qyhJXOJhE.png?height=864&width=1162)\n\n### Reward Developers/Modders/Marketers\n\nIf a game is fully decentralized without a developing company behind it, who will maintain the game, run customer service, work on new projects, find new partnerships...etc?\n\nIn lieu of the length of the article so far and because we believe that the possible implementations of this are not unique to games, we will not touch upon it here. We suggest the following readings:\n\n<https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html> (specifically check out futarchy)\n\n<https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c>, <https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html>, or to check out index-coop DAO’s [contributor compensation process](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rIZDsJtugfISRyrmLzSNCdNiTwH-TzXcDSxrNTNLZiU/edit#gid=457128231) (thought at the moment it is centralized)\n\n[https://twitter.com/alexdphan/status/1454140309328187393?s=21](https://twitter.com/alexdphan/status/1454140309328187393?s=21)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Pillar 6: Opensource\n\nOne protection that blockchain games provide against bad governance is the ability to return the game to any specific snapshot in time.\n\nBlockchain games have publicly available contracts which run their game logic. Many games have not only published public GitHub Repos with their smart contracts, but they’ve also open-sourced the Unity client of the game, including the interface and graphical resources ([an example](https://github.com/planetarium/NineChronicles)).\n\nThus anyone can aggregate this data, decide on a specific period of time when they want to revert the game back to and alter the logic of the contracts and game assets such that it replicates a specific moment in time, then deploy this new version of the game (though at the moment at non-negligible costs). Item and token balances would not be able to be returned unless the blockchain itself is forked, but at the very least, the game would start over OSRS style. [Nine Chronicles](https://docs.nine-chronicles.com/) is an example of an open-source blockchain game.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/F6ng8ATwhFoaMCYmDuto8.jpg?height=353&width=616)\n\nBy being easy to fork, blockchain games achieve ease of exit, a core tenet of good governance. Any decisions contrary to the wishes of the community that are implemented via plutocratic interest or bot-attacks are reversible, though not at a negligible cost.\n\n### Flourishing Parallel Worlds\n\nCrypto + open source games have implications beyond governance. Modded versions of games have always been at the forefront of pushing gameplay to new frontiers and genres. In fact, some of the most popular games of all time were inspired or directly created in/as mods of other games. From user-created modes, maps to user-created in-game assets, mods defined and created many of the games we know and love today.\n\nBut mods today though suffer from increased centralization as they become more popular. As they become more popular, they often get absorbed by the original game creator. Because many of these open-source/modded games are usually not profitable and maintained by people as a side hobby or an experiment, to sustain them, this happens more often than not (Minecraft is a prominent counter-example).\n\nBecause of the previously discussed ways that blockchain can prove ownership and generate continued revenue through royalty implementations, it is possible to have an open-source game that is also able to generate continuous revenue through the sale of in-game assets for the original creator AND the modders. The modders can also be rewarded through mechanisms detailed in pillar 5.\n\nA good example where open-sourced blockchain development could have benefited a game is the development of DayZ.\n\nTLDR: DayZ was first a mod developed by an Arma 2 player. The modder took the best aspects of Arma 2 and transformed it into a survival game with zombies which became playable on an Arma 2 server. Soon there were spin-off servers that layered more mods on top of the OG DayZ mod that offered vastly different gameplay mechanics and features (PVP focused, base building, etc.) than other servers. Players naturally gravitated to the servers that contained the gameplay they liked.\n\nThen, Bohemia Interactive decided it wanted to cash in on this opportunity, so it brought in the creator of the first DayZ mod and developers from their Arma 2 team to create a stand-alone, official DayZ game. Unfortunately, the new team unilaterally decided on features that should be in the official game without even considering the different player types across the servers, which alienated most of the PVP and base building lovers. The game itself turned out to be a buggy mess, and full of features that players did not ask for.\n\nBy ignoring the different player groups that existed in the different servers as the dev team began creating the standalone, it left a vacuum that games like PUBG (Player Unknown developed a battle royale server for DayZ which was his claim to fame), Rust, and Subnautica satisfied the desire these left-over players had, which blossomed into multibillion-dollar games across new genres.\n\n![The predecessor of PUBG started as a mod of Arma 2 (Credits to HandsomeJayce on Youtube)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/B0noO2_J12D3nNniKA84-.png?height=654&width=1273)\n\nSo how and why could blockchain development benefit the development of DayZ in this scenario? Imagine a parallel universe, where Bohemia Interactive didn’t make the unilateral choices they did (think governance again), and instead from day 1 started by providing open-source tools and assets to scale those different servers. Through NFTs, they could have generated revenue from those assets as modders utilized or sold them in their own servers. **Letting those modded DayZ servers thrive and grow while continuing to provide backend support and tools would have been a much safer route to take while still financially benefiting from ecosystem expansion. And DayZ could have survived the innovator’s dilemma by seeding promising mods without ruining its potential.**\n\n# Redefining the Future of Work?\n\nI am not an economist, official or self-proclaimed. The claims I make in this section are based on reasoning alone without a background in the existing literature. If there are well-established empirical studies that support or refute these claims please send them my way! That being said I hope you have some leniency if I throw around terms without much rigor.\n\n### Wages\n\nIt seems intuitive, and I seem to recall from freshman year macroeconomics, that in a perfectly competitive world, labor market equilibrium happens when the marginal benefit from hiring another worker is equal to the wage rate. Put another way, under perfect competition in the labor market, wages for the new employee will be equal to how much value he/she can generate for the firm.\n\nOf course in the real world, nothing is perfectly competitive and there are (for some people) massive switching costs to jobs, informational asymmetry, differing market conditions, and rent-seeking behavior by corporations who use a combination of these tactics to offer lower wages than the value each worker creates. One can imagine a setting where there is an excess supply of unemployed workers, a lack of union protection, high-living costs resulting in switching costs, and general abuse of informational asymmetry - offering lower than market-rate wages, altering benefits...etc - resulting in lower wages than at theoretical equilibrium. The aggregate value produced via labor is thus captured by the firm instead of being distributed to the employee.\n\nThis often means that the world’s least connected, least educated that live in the least protected geographies with the poorest economies suffer the most from these asymmetries. But note that these conditions can happen anywhere in the world.\n\n### Does Crypto Gaming Help?\n\nWe often hear about how crypto gaming will redefine work itself - this is the fundamental mission of YGG. Gabby Dizon, CEO of YGG, posits that the question people of the future will ask is whether it's more fun to make money playing a game than it is to be an Uber driver or a construction worker - that the employment choice of the future will be between gig work and metaverse work. But this question only holds under assumptions that value created by contributors can be fully captured, or more wholly captured by the contributors themselves. If such asymmetries as mentioned above exist, then crypto gaming is just another instance of gig work outsourced to those with the least opportunities to allow value accrual to large capital holders (scholarship managers, guilds...etc).\n\n### So… Can it? Aka. How Crypto Changes this Equation\n\n### Trustlessness\n\nFrom Pillar 2, we understand that RMT markets are opaque and have bad UX for buyers of in-game assets, but the introduction of crypto can allow users to transact trustlessly. This is one of the key pieces in redefining the future of work.\n\nBecause this is a grey market, scams abound and the discomfort of entering in your credit card data without assurance that your gold will be delivered is nerve-racking, the sellers who have the most/best positive ratings dominate purchases. This means that sellers who have the capital to deploy customer service, marketing bots on forums/in-game, set up and host custom websites...etc will end up attracting more customers, which reflexively attracts more customers, regardless of price. This incentivizes the creation of larger pools that expand this initial capital to gain size, then raise prices. Once you have built enough trust and legitimacy such that it makes sense to use your platform over cheaper alternatives, it's very hard for new entrants to unseat existing sellers.\n\n[https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645844334714883](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645844334714883)\n\n[https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645845991477250](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645845991477250)\n\n[https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645847740489729](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645847740489729)\n\nCrypto levels this playing field. Once you know that each vendor is trustworthy (by definition of the blockchain), then it is in the buyers’ best interest to purchase from the pool with the best price, or the most benefits. As for the sellers, any seller is now able to plug into the marketplace without the upfront investment of scaling legitimacy. **And because the marketplace platforms themselves are again easy to create, producer income can scale linearly with production. The margin that accrued to those at scale and to the platform is now distributed to everyone.**\n\n### Rewarding Time and Effort\n\nIf there is demand for in-game assets and gold, and RMT platforms exist where they can be changed for fiat, the production of in-game assets and gold is valuable labor denominated in fiat. But even one step further, crypto allows the rewarding of in-game contributions outside of the simple production of in-game assets.\n\nIn the past you contributed your time and soul to a game, amassing items that are then circulated into the economy. You build guilds, interact with other players and build social credibility within the game. **With the introduction of crypto-gaming, it has become possible to reward and incentivize these players and core contributors in a way that is fair and algorithmic.** As introduced in Pillar 5, gamers can be incentivized by levels, times, or core contributions as voted retroactively by members of the community.\n\nCertainly, Zezima and Woox contributed to the popularity of Runescape as much as many of the mods at Jagex, and Dean Hall did the same for Arma 2 with DayZ.\n\n### Geography\n\nFinally, crypto gaming is global. Most often when we produce goods and services, we are selling them to the purchasing power of our immediate vicinity or the section of the supply chain that is within our immediate vicinity. The farmer, clothes maker, bank teller of a specific region are henceforth bound in their wages by the economic conditions of the region they live in, so that the demand for their goods and services, either by the end-user or the next step in the supply chain, come from local buyers. This means that those who live in countries with economic instability have commensurate low wages.\n\nThis is true even in software. Despite software’s global nature, in practice at a smaller scale, local firms use local technologies. This is why despite being an SWE, some of my Axie scholars tell me they make as much if not more playing Axie than coding.\n\nWith crypto gaming, however, any worker anywhere can tap into a global source of demand. Games have been global from day 1. Because markets built on crypto are also fundamentally global, assets produced in-game that are then sold to those who want to play the game, are matched with the highest price. This purchasing power then leads to higher wages and empowerment of the aforementioned regions via capital inflow from more economically developed regions. This is why Axie scholars can sometimes earn more than their yearly wage playing Axie Infinity, or why they’re able to buy houses, laundry machines from Axie earnings. This is also why Venezuelan gold farmers exist on WoW and OSRS.\n\nCombined with the fact that transparent markets allow sustainable earnings for smaller players and redistribute margin from larger pools and platforms to smaller users, crypto gaming will allow any individual to play a game and sell the byproduct of their gaming to a global market. Furthermore, they will be able to get compensated by the depth of their contributions regardless of their geography.\n\n### Warning: Over Finalization\n\nWhile we illustrated an ambitious vision for how blockchain games can benefit gaming, we also acknowledge the [overwhelming response](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/nzto5t/blockchain_nfts_and_gaming_is_there_a_future_in_it/) from the gaming community that does not want financialization in their games.\n\nAt the end of the day, games are meant to be fun. Though you may derive auxiliary revenue from playing, if the purpose of the game becomes to make money, or if large financial interests come in and speculate on prices of rare items and land thus pricing out players, then gameplay becomes exclusionary to the players themselves. **This is why it’s so important to maintain decentralized player-driven governance over coin-voting schemes in NFT games.**\n\n**Overall, we warn against games seeking to maximally price discriminate through NFT licenses, NFT items...etc, and any cash-grab projects that add no value.** We hope that games can still maintain their end goal of providing a fun time for the user while using NFTs, governance, and contributor rewards to enhance games’ functionality and ability to tell a narrative, thus creating a more immersive and positive gaming experience.\n\n## The Future\n\nStory + Value + Virtual worlds. Games have the opportunity to become the backdrop of what is being called the metaverse - [as defined by Mathew Ball](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/forwardtothemetaverseprimer):\n\n> “A massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds which can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users, and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications, and payments.”\n\nFortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox have demonstrated they have surpassed use cases beyond just gaming and dub sub-games within their platforms as experiences. As the games evolve, so will our involvement within their worlds.\n\n![The Canonical Example - Travis Scott Convert In Fornite](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BmWzazqNn5fZUxy2UzIvZ.jpg?height=1200&width=1800)\n\nWe hope that these experiences will be able to take advantage of the aforementioned pillars of crypto-gaming while avoiding over-finalization to provide more immersive, open, and fair experiences in whatever this may evolve into in the next 20 years.\n\nIn our next article, we will introduce protocols building economic primitives in the metaverse. We are also working on a paper on optimized proof of participation models based on on-chain verifiable participation data in crypto games. So catch us again soon.\n\nIf you've enjoyed this article and want to support us in writing more about crypto gaming, the metaverse, and other related topics please consider purchasing this as an NFT!

预言机是一个滞后指标，它从单个交易所获取数据，导致缺乏市场覆盖，没有考虑跨交易对、CEX、竞争 DEX、不同 DEX 版本或 DEX 移植到的流动性碎片其他区块链， 3/ 成交量加权平均价格（VWAP）预言机（Chainlink Price Feeds）比较跟踪所有中心化和去中心化交易所，按实际交易量加权并丢弃异常值 ， 这产生了全面的市场覆盖，增加了市场操纵的成本，4/ 链上 TWAP 预言机的第一个主要问题是防篡改（安全性）和新鲜度（准确性）之间存在负相关 ， 这意味着您不能在不降低准确性的情况下提高安全性，也不能在不降低安全性的情况下提高准确性，4/ 链上 TWAP 预言机的第一个主要问题是防篡改（安全性）和新鲜度（准确性）之间存在负相关 ， 这意味着您不能在不降低准确性的情况下提高安全性，也不能在不降低安全性的情况下提高准确性， 5/ 因此，与波动时期的真实市场价格相比，TWAP 预言机变得不准确 ， 这种延迟的定价数据可能导致清算速度不够快，这在市场低迷期间可能导致无法清算的有毒头寸，6/ 新的 DEX 设计还具有集中流动性模型的其他细微差别 ， 虽然这意味着更高的资本效率，但与 xy=k 模型相比，这也意味着更低的操纵成本， 7/ 链上 TWAP 预言机的第二个主要问题是它们固有的缺乏市场覆盖 ， 使用 TWAP，只需要操纵一个交易所，本质上变得更容易，尤其是在使用交易量或流动性较小的交易所时，8/ 即使流动性较低的资产，使用 VWAP 预言机更安全，因为必须操纵整个\\*市场来改变价格，此时市场范围内的价格实际上发生了变化，这意味着 VWAP 仍然提供正确的价值（它是刚才是流动性问题）， 9/ 即使资产在单一交易所交易，使用 VWAP 预言机仍然更安全，因为您不知道明天的流动性状况会如何 ， 流动性可以迅速转变，这意味着您 100% 的市场覆盖率可以变成< 1% 的市场覆盖率，链上 TWAP，10/ 这意味着虽然低流动性资产将继续存在（预言机无法控制这一点），但设计合理的预言机应始终报告市场范围内的价格并使市场操纵成本最大化（TWAP 无法实现）， 11/ 因此，借贷市场创建者不仅需要注意使用具有全市场覆盖的 VWAP

The idea of showing solidarity with fellow human beings is a beautiful one, and one that should exclusively be done by individual people, not brands.\n\n![Don't be like Coca Cola](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ASQ4IvaCGXwvxE6I4woYx.png?height=847&width=720)\n\n**Why?**\n\nUsing a brand to show solidarity is disingenuous and essentially profiteering off the kindness of the naive. As with any statement we make as a brand we should to be real and consistent. If we show our solidarity with the victims of one injustice, then our silence to another is unacceptable. The Mundo Lingo community sees a world full of united people; to give more value to one human life over another is against our founding philosophy. To the contrary, we mustn’t allow ML to be used for the elitism of one sector of humanity over the rest of the world especially to the end of generating meaningless ‘likes’.\n\n**Charity Events**\n\nAny changes to the classic format of a ML event should be checked with the Community Team. As described above, we cannot favour one cause over another. We cannot favour one demographic over another no matter how obvious it is that they are deserving of our collective compassion.\n\n**Solidarity Hashtags**\n\nFor the above-mentioned reasons, we cannot be involved in solidarity hashtags, flag placement on our branded graphics.\n\n**Merry Christmas!**\n\nOur public are from many religions. Understanding this means our brand does not celebrate one religious holiday while staying quiet on another. For now, ML does not wish our public a Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukah, Eid Mubarak, Halloween, Patricks Day nor any other religious ceremony, because we won’t exclude those of other religions by way of silence. If a team member want’s to do this they can, but only personally as themselves with their personal profile. \n\nWe can however mark the various New Year’s celebrations such as Chinese New Year and December 31st.", "timestamp": 1635932539, "digest": "wE-irRVi7eJEcQmOHeWxtGkZlwEBhHrVY3Ey4gaVvBE", "contributor": "0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae"}

{"id": "QaUzliunJB4K9HE-Olcw3BL7Nk3rJKGzkmEr2Ygluzc", "title": "Why Portable Reputation is the Next Superpower for DAOs and Web3", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ySb3Z5x2kOd6MBBba7xC4.png?height=1068&width=2134)\n\n**Web2 was a huge leap in allowing individuals to build, craft, and curate digital reputations on various platforms. But that era is nearing an end, and Web3 promises to put us in control of — and give us ownership over — our digital reputations.**\n\nWe’ll also be able to take our reputations anywhere, free of centralized control, to build stronger platforms, digital spaces, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).\n\nThe concept of decentralized, portable reputation has been flying under the radar but is something that’s necessary for fulfilling the promise of Web3. Things like economic transactions using NFTs and DAO governance are based on trust and reputation. Once users, DAOs, and the Web3 world at large understand how portable reputation is coming to life today, use case implementation and mass adoption will become a no-brainer.\n\nThe first step is recognizing how centralized, Web2 reputation management is disempowering society. We can then begin to understand how portable reputation, in the form of scores, reports, or NFTs using both on and off-chain data, can be created. Portable reputation can then become a reality and play a central part of a more free, fair, and self-sovereign operating system for DAOs and Web3 writ large.\n\n## Moving Past Static, Centralized Web2 Reputation\n\nIndividual control and ownership of our reputational data under Web2 is an illusion. An Uber driver with a five-star rating, for example, has developed a strong and stable reputation on that platform. But that rating is just one dimension of that person’s overall digital reputation, and worse, is completely owned by Uber. The driver can’t take their well-built reputation with them to Lyft or another platform, and even worse that rating can be altered by Uber themselves if they so choose.\n\nIn recent years, DAOs have emerged to shine a light on better ways to organize and operate communities of all shapes and sizes. And in a DAO, reputation doesn’t just matter — reputation is everything. So as Web2 becomes a thing of the past, we’ll need a fair, accurate, and efficient way of building and maintaining reputations to facilitate all manner of economic and social interactions. Reputations form the lynchpin of group dynamics such as admittance, privileges, and voting rights.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Web2 has enjoyed several advantages in creating reputations. All user data and interactions exist on a centralized platform, allowing companies like Yelp to dub certain individuals as “super users” based on certain criteria. We have the blockchain data to achieve similar goals under Web3 but are just now developing the technology to achieve the same goals.\n\nWe can now empower users with a holistic view of their reputation using on and off-chain data, accurately reflective of the influence they’ve had on DAOs, economic transactions they’ve made, and a plethora of other factors. Portable reputation allows us to build, develop, and collaborate in a Web3 world.\n\n**We can now appear trustworthy in a trustless Web3 world.**\n\n![The number of decentralized identity (DeID) connections just over the past month on BrightID. DeID growth is a critical factor towards enabling portable reputation.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*4xEcWQB3ualCF6bprxQ9BA.png)\n\nThe number of decentralized identity (DeID) connections just over the past month on [BrightID](https://explorer.brightid.org/#). DeID growth is a critical factor towards enabling portable reputation.\n\n## How Portable Reputation Works Within DAOs and Web3\n\nWhile DAOs are likely the best current use case for portable reputation, it illustrates the potentially broad and widespread applications for decentralized, portable reputation. But in order to explore these possibilities, it’s important to have a concrete understanding of what portable reputation looks and feels like in a Web3 environment. As well as the tangible impact it has on how DAOs admit members, operate, and delegate rights and privileges.\n\n**Orange makes portable reputation possible by aggregating both on and off-chain data and creating a unique reputation non-fungible token (NFT), report, or real-time score for every individual.**\n\nOn-chain data that can be collected and minted into a portable reputation NFT includes:\n\n* Transaction data and user behavior\n* Digital asset balance and ownership history\n* Historical asset exchange volume\n* Smart contract associations\n* Prior history of holdings and transactions\n\nOrange then combines on-chain data with the following off-chain data sources to enable an individual’s portable reputation report, score, or NFT:\n\n* In-app data like game collectibles and purchases\n* Reviews and ratings from various platforms\n* User profile information from social networks\n* IoT data like geolocation and health status\n* Financial data from banks and insurance firms\n* KYC verification data such as government ID cards\n\nCombining data from all possible sources represents the first-ever minted version of an individual’s Verifiable Credentials (VCs) that are owned by the individual. These credentials can then be displayed and used as a form of utility in the DAO. For instance, a DAO focused on dApp development may only want to admit developers with a certain amount of experience and reputation in the developer community.\n\nFor DAO admission, developers can mint their portable reputation NFT to present to the collective for admittance. And if the user wants to enhance their reputation over time, the activities or projects that complete as part of a DAO they’re currently a member of — like Gitcoin for instance — the NFT will dynamically incorporate that data and boost their score. And once admittance is gained, DAO members with higher reputation scores might have more voting weight in the direction of the organization or project.\n\nThere’s also enormous potential of merging portable identity with physical world applications. For example, Blockchain experts in Europe are currently exploring self-sovereign, blockchain-based [identity solutions for public transit](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2096720921000099). Once portable reputation becomes integrated with these kinds of physical world initiatives, the reality of individuals controlling their reputations in all spaces and interacting in a more equitable fashion begins to take shape.\n\n![Accurate, authentic, user-owned reputation scores from multiple chains and data sources are now a reality with the Orange Protocol.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*QtGmcxGTWCu32Zaj9JJAzQ.png)\n\nAccurate, authentic, user-owned reputation scores from multiple chains and data sources are now a reality with the Orange Protocol.\n\n## Portable Reputation is Shifting the Balance of Power\n\nDecentralizing identity and reputation isn’t just about data ownership. It’s about fundamentally shifting the balance of power that’s coalesced under Web2 Governance of all spaces will be shared by an entire community, rather than a small group of people or a single business entity who are likely driven to maximize their wealth and benefits. Reputations on centralized platforms don’t necessarily exist to serve users first and foremost.\n\nUser data will also no longer be held by a third-party party and at substantial risk of data leaks. The Orange protocol, for instance, uses DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) to link the individual directly with their data. Every time this data is accessed, the request must contain signature data to be validated. Therefore, none of your data can be used or associated with you without your authorization. There is never a central point of failure or trust.\n\nIndividuals also don’t have to worry about oversharing of data. Netizens are in control of what information is shared from a single portable reputation wallet. For example, you can use the wallet to prove that you are over 18 without having to reveal your actual Date of Birth. Since the identity information itself isn’t held on the blockchain-based ledger, it is totally controlled by you, the individual.\n\nBut the most fundamental shift that will occur — and what makes portable reputation the next superpower for Web3 — is that individuals go from renting space on centralized platforms to owning their own reputations. Time, effort, and investment spent on building social and economic status is locked in and completely owned by the user, with the ability to take their reputations wherever they go.\n\n***Ready to learn more about the future of Portable Reputation?

However, DID is simply the first step towards constructing decentralized communities. Transactions and interactions can’t take place without trust. And reputation is the foundation upon which trust is based.\n\n**Bringing portable reputation to decentralized Web3 for developers and individuals is precisely why [Orange Protocol](https://www.orangeprotocol.io/) exists.**\n\nOrange represents a massive sea change from how reputation is controlled, managed, and utilized. The Web2 era of centralized identity and reputation management is becoming a thing of the past, and the Orange Protocol is here to put digital reputations back in the hands of the users, builders, and developers.\n\nBecause the Web3 world consists of so many decentralized identities, communities, and data sources, it’s been an enormous challenge to build, maintain, and carry reputations built over time and across platforms.\n\nWe’re here to show you how Orange is the first protocol of its kind that will allow Web3 netizens to take their reputations wherever they want, and how developers can build applications that utilize reputation for more fair, efficient communities.\n\n## Wrangling Web3 Reputation Algorithms and Data\n\nReputation in the Web3 space essentially consists of algorithms that calculate and compute reputation in various decentralized spaces. However, these algorithms can’t communicate or talk with one another, keeping individuals’ various reputations siloed and separated as well.\n\nThe well-earned reputation in a certain DAO via massive involvement and participation, for instance, isn’t visible to the next DAO they join. Even though that reputation is extremely relevant to how they’ll be positioned to participate.\n\nConnecting these algorithms is one of the biggest fundamental challenges that Orange solves. Not only does Orange fetch user data from various Web3 systems, but the protocol then generates results in the form of reputation scores that can be used across systems and blockchains.\n\n**Our goal is to connect Web3 data and algorithms in a way that makes reputation portable and completely owned by the user.**\n\n![Orange enables portable reputation from multiple on and off chain data sources.\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NP2L7BOeqk6Vj2HmB5sg8.png?height=788&width=1400)\n\n## Orange Serves both Web3 Builders and Netizens\n\nOrange exists to serve two primary sets of users:\n\n## 1. DAO and dApp Builders\n\nOrange acts as a middle-ware for builders and developers of decentralized apps (dApps) and decentralized autonomous organizations [(DAOs) who want to incorporate portable reputation](https://medium.com/@joinorangedao/why-portable-reputation-is-the-next-superpower-for-daos-and-web3-f46a53f80e6a) into their systems and functionality. Orange allows developers to use existing algorithm providers or configure their own algorithms with data of their choosing. They can even utilize their own dApp or DAO data, using one-stop consent management from users.\n\nDevelopers can then generate portable reputation with those algorithms and data sets in the form of scores, reports, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or verifiable credentials (VC). Any of these forms of programmable reputation can then seamlessly integrate into dApp or DAO systems to trigger customized actions or privileges, such as voting rights or access to airdrops. Orange then allows reputation-related data and algorithms to be shared with other networks or platforms.\n\n## 2. Individual Web3 Netizens\n\nOrange also acts as a decentralized reputation management portal for all Web3 netizens. Users can browse all on-chain data associated with their Digital Identity (DID) using Orange. They can also link user on-chain, off-chain, and in-app data to their unique DID. In addition, netizens may also view, manage, and authenticate any reputation claims or requests.\n\nFinally, individuals can select the portable reputation output of their choosing, whether it be a score, report, NFT, or VC, using the data and algorithm of their choosing. The architecture of Orange is designed to give users total control over their reputation.\n\n## Orange is Completely Private and Self-Sovereign\n\nOrange’s capability of generating reputation comes from fetching information from a Data Provider (DP) and then sending it to an algorithm provider (AP) to be processed. This is done on an encrypted basis using the APs public key to maintain security and confidentiality throughout the data transmission process.\n\n**User Authorization is also built-in to Orange, ensuring that no unwanted data is associated with a user’s reputation score, report, or NFT.**\n\nOrange protocol uses decentralized identifiers to link associated data with wallet addresses across multiple chains. And each calculation that goes into a certain reputation score must carry a user signature with it in order to be valid. Because users sign all actions with their private keys, individuals are placed in complete control of their reputation. This also helps developers ensure that each calculation or score is accurate and purpose-built to every use case scenario.\n\n**Orange is also non-custodial, so reputation data isn’t at risk of being used for purposes not designated by the user.**\n\n## The Role of Algorithm and Data Providers\n\nBoth DPs and APs play a central role in enabling portable reputation using Orange. Scores and reports are made possible by DPs feeding information to APs for processing and generation. APs can then configure data sources and algorithms to suit their use case, whether it be a dApp or DAO.\n\nOrange also enables a collaborative approach to building a knowledge base of algorithms, as APs can choose to make their algorithms public for integration with any other systems or applications. APs also have the option of keeping their algorithms completely private and accessible only to them on Orange.\n\n**It’s our belief that reputation models built by APs using Orange have huge potential for the future functioning and organization of Web3 ecosystems.**\n\nIn terms of DPs, Orange allows a more open and progressive model of sourcing data. Traditionally, the majority of data is isolated and siloed in the system it was collected in. This scenario can be anything from a centralized social media network to a DAO. But to make user reputation completely accurate and portable, Orange has been designed to access on-chain data throughout the entire Web3 space, irrespective of which ledger network information resides on.\n\nReputation outputs from Orange are therefore the result of data diversity not made possible previously. For example, the protocol can utilize information from DPs as diverse as KYC information from exchanges to entities that issue verified credentials such as driver’s licences and passports. And like APs, DPs can choose to make the schemas they build private or public, potentially helping future DPs on Orange data more effectively.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*bzYH8_IJI3Nd0m_B)\n\nOrange generates reputation based on custom algorithm and data specifications.\n\nThe Orange protocol is purpose-built to empower developers, APs, and DPs to build and use reputation models on Web3 unlike anything that’s come before. We’re excited to provide the tools and architecture that pull from such a wide array of data sources, while building a developer community that shares and improves upon algorithms.\n\n**Moving forward, we see the potential for Orange to become a massive, decentralized collaboration network that will unearth new, innovative ways of using portable reputation in Web3.**", "timestamp": 1635941134, "digest": "zXr26CwNXAUs75NXdMuYSlwhwPu0CA04z84jN5DBcCA", "contributor": "0x187E46cB0770a68bDB7fF6818420Ea6BeC67f27a"}

And with Orange, we’re now able to take our well-earned reputations from place to place.**\n\nAnd as we build out the [Orange community](https://discord.gg/gFV7SB98UA), we want to foster a sense of limitless potential applications and use cases.\n\nBut to get everyone started, here are some of the core use cases that we’ve already mapped out for Orange and where things could potentially go.\n\n## Reputation-Based Participation\n\nReputation is a critical part of how any organization, both in the physical and digital realms, functions. How individuals participate in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), for example, will completely change once portable reputation is introduced into the equation. And these concepts can then be applied to participation in other arenas like gaming and even real-world governance.\n\nHere are just a few participation-related use cases that we currently envision [using the Orange protocol](https://www.orangeprotocol.io/), both in terms of DAOs and beyond:\n\n* Initiating proposals and discussions\n* Voting weight and participation\n* Work contributions to treasury management\n* Records of donations to public goods\n* Participation in certain activities\n\nMoving forward in Web3, more spaces and communities will resemble a DAO architecture, if not become one altogether. Many blockchain-based video gaming and NFT projects, for example, are formally DAOs where collectors, users, and players have a say in the direction of the project. The problem is, new participants can’t bring their well-earned reputation from other DAOs or games, making various forms of activity and participation less fair and efficient.\n\nOther real-world applications like Burn Signal and Coordinape are emerging to fulfill a similar goal of better participation, collaboration, and resource allocation within DAOs. Orange is adding another layer to reputation-based participation of any Web3 community, making the biggest and most valuable contributors instantly recognizable.\n\n## Reputation as a Gateway to Entry\n\nNot every community should be open to anyone and everyone. And that’s not a bad thing. Whether it’s a DAO or any other form of collaborative Web3 group, the collective should be able to decide who gets in, who doesn’t, and based on what criteria. Without portable reputation, this becomes extremely difficult. Existing DAOs and communities can’t determine which individuals are likely to contribute the most, and potential entrants into the DAO can’t demonstrate their skills, experience, and capabilities.\n\nBut using portable reputation is a gateway into communities isn’t just about vetting people who want in. DAOs and other communities can use reputation scores as an acquisition strategy. A new gaming community, for instance, can search and filter existing gamers by [reputation scores using Orange](https://medium.com/@joinorangedao/why-portable-reputation-is-the-next-superpower-for-daos-and-web3-f46a53f80e6a) custom data sources and algorithms.\n\nThose users can then be given exclusive invites, enhanced voting rights, or placed on a whitelist to get them to join the DAO. Organizers can therefore use portable reputation to build the communities they want from the very beginning.\n\nWith Orange, any user’s entry into a system, network, or DAO can be designed based on criteria such as:\n\n* Sybil-resistant identity verification\n* Possession of fungible or NFT assets\n* Social-media verification\n* Subscriber and/or follower count\n* Third-party endorsements\n\nAdmission to DAOs and other networks via exclusive NFTs is already a reality. In fact, many NFT projects themselves use the artwork to double as a ticket into the DAO itself. With Orange Protocol, reputation can now be tied to an NFT for similar purposes. And when an individual gets admitted into the DAO due to sufficient reputation, their privileges for things like voting and airdrops can be dynamically set on a tiered basis via smart contracts.\n\n## Trustless Economic Activity\n\nFinally, portable reputation will be a key factor in enabling the growth of economic activity in the Web3 era. In Web2, economic trust and reputation are managed and controlled by centralized entities and services. Whether it’s a seller rating on eBay or a driver score on Uber, our economic reputations are largely siloed and not self-sovereign.\n\nAnd as we divest of centralized Web2 economic infrastructure, we’ll need new ways to build, manage, and maintain our reputations so that transactions between parties can be trustworthy and seamless. Facilitating economic trust will be a large part of what Orange will help achieve, whether it’s judging creditworthiness in the DeFi space or conducting peer-to-peer digital asset transactions.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*3DlPf3EKWMJ9CwxpOAl2jg.png)\n\nReputation via asset scoring for DeFi is just one potential use case for the Web3 economy.\n\nOrange can produce reputation scores, reports, or NFTs that enable Web3 economic activity by pulling and analyzing thousands of various data sources that reflect things like:\n\n* Transactional histories\n* Asset values & attributes\n* Off-chain verified financial risk data\n* Verified on and off-chain identities\n\nPortable reputation will be a cornerstone of our Web3 world and there’s no telling what use cases will emerge over the next few years. From DAO access to voting rights and trustless economic activity, use cases and applications of [Orange and portable reputation](https://medium.com/@joinorangedao/orange-what-the-web3-reputation-protocol-is-made-of-3956df0fd0e9) will only expand along with the growth of Web3 and decentralized ecosystems.\n\n***Want to learn more about how to build applications and use cases on Orange?

{"id": "P16U7fJj3XlNNkyCuNsNkIzK6Gd-rVZNGsGN-uLbZEc", "title": "How Snapshot and Orange are Making Crypto More Democratic with Reputation-Based Voting", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kfvXce8YOdHRAs50dYrqi.jpeg?height=640&width=1280)\n\nToday, token-based voting is the primary mechanism for deciding the direction of a DAO’s growth and development. But there are inherent flaws and inequities in this model that necessitate new solutions to create more equitable and regenerative DAO projects.\n\n**That’s why [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/) and [Orange](https://www.orangeprotocol.io/) are collaborating to bring reputation-based voting to life, giving the most loyal and active DAO contributors the biggest say. We’re making true democracy a reality in the crypto space.**\n\nThe year 2021 has most decidedly been the year of the DAO. From Layer 1 protocols to DeFi and NFT projects, DAOs are playing a critical role in determining the future of just about every blockchain community and the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nBut for DAOs, DeFi, and NFT ecosystems to evolve, governance tools will need to expand upon the current token-weighted voting parameters. It’s one of the key challenges that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin pointed out recently, explaining inherent risks, dangers, and [inequites of deceltralized governance](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) (DeGov) and token-based voting.\n\nThe economic inequities of token-weighted voting aside, there also hasn’t been any fool-proof way of verifying voters’ identity. These factors combine to make current governance models vulnerable to single users casting multiple votes, or token hoarding whales who disproportionately affecting outcomes.\n\nSnapshot is at the forefront of innovating DAO participation and solving these core issues. And, in combination with [portable reputation on Orange](https://medium.com/@orangeprotocol/why-portable-reputation-is-the-next-superpower-for-daos-and-web3-f46a53f80e6a), together we’ll be creating more equitable and customizable participation structures across all DAOs.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZYUt7p9bLQedkV-jl8cAp.png?height=814&width=1400)\n\n## The Importance of Reputation-Based Participation\n\nIn most DAOs, reputation is everything. Community members and moderators recognize the contributions and engagement of key individuals, and their opinions begin to carry more weight as projects and communities evolve. But this reality is at odds with traditional token-weighted voting standards, since currently voting power is linearly tied to token holdings, which requires owning capital. Steps in the right direction have been made with the proliferation of delegated voting power within DAOs, but this model still tends to favor the voice of those who have more money.\n\nThis leaves DAO voting susceptible to token holders who are merely speculators or have no intrinsic vested interest in the future success of the DAO. That’s why the importance of reputation-weighted voting is beginning to emerge, as DAOs seek to build communities where individuals are consistently generating engagement, as opposed to a degenerative paradigm, where passive users could accumulate tokens for a short period of time just to vote solely in terms of their own self-interest or not at all.\n\nCombining Snapshot’s expansive DAO voting dataset with the capabilities of Orange to produce customizable reputation reports, resumes, and NFTs, [DAOs can act as algorithm providers](https://medium.com/@orangeprotocol/orange-what-the-web3-reputation-protocol-is-made-of-3956df0fd0e9) to create voting structures that more accurately reflect the sentiment of the community. Snapshot’s dataset can be used to boost the reputations of users in combination with Orange and create their own reputation management systems. Applications beyond weighted voting, such as airdrops, DAO membership levels, and rewards based on reputation are also on the horizon.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*0RU6rqyldhttyKG_)\n\n## Sybil-Resistant and Quadratic Voting Measures\n\nThe concept of quadratic voting isn’t new, but until now it’s something that’s been difficult to implement both in physical-world governance and DAOs. With quadratic voting, an individual’s voting weight is increased not only based on how many tokens they hold but also based on how many others are voting in the same direction.\n\nFor example, 100 tokens-worth of voting power from 10 different individuals collectively is weighed more heavily than 100 tokens-worth of voting power from just one individual. This way, the direction of the DAO is more likely to be determined by the collective decision of the majority of its members as opposed to the decisions of the wealthy few.\n\n**Quadratic voting will likely become the standard for reputation-based decision-making in DAOs and Web3 communities.**\n\nAnother key aspect to how Snapshot and Orange will work together is making DAO voting sybil-resistant. It’s an unfortunate reality that many communities are plagued with bots or individuals using multiple identities to adversely affect voting. Orange brings the ability for DAOs to verify the identity of each voter, along with their reputation, to ensure that each vote is authentic and that every identity belongs to a committed DAO member.\n\nFor instance, an Orange algorithm might issue a reputation verified credential indicating that a certain Snapshot user has more than an 80 percent probability of being a real person. This computation takes into account verification data from sources like BrightID and Idena — along with internal Snapshot data — to determine the activity level of the user. Quadratic voting has already been pioneered for public goods projects by platforms like Gitcoin, but Snapshot and Orange are helping to make the process more sybil-resistant than ever.\n\n## Integrating Snapshot and Orange for DAO Voting\n\nSnapshot has already created an efficient platform for DAO proposals, discussions, and voting. And by integrating Orange scores into Snapshot, DAOs will be able to weigh votes based on reputation, rather than token holdings. Instead of wealth dictating who has the most say, a member’s track record and resume of engagement in multiple DAOs will give them a bigger say, promoting a higher form of democracy than we’ve seen in the crypto space.\n\nReputation-based voting on Snapshot could also take into account the length of time that users hold specific tokens, giving their votes more weight as well. This disincentivizes pump-and-dumps or individuals simply acquiring a large number of tokens in a short time span to disproportionately affect a single proposal. Participation and token holding periods are just two of many factors that DAOs could use when evaluating members’ reputations, resumes, or reports constructed by Orange.\n\nOnce Snapshot fully implements reputation-weighted voting alongside Orange, this new model will also incentivize users to be more active in DAO governance for the purpose of boosting their reputations. Discords and social engagement will increase, and more meaningful discussions will take place in terms of where projects are headed.

**共识层 (Eth2)**\n\n**合并后交易费会去哪里？**\n\n10 月 14 日，Yearn 的 @bantg 发推表示，合并不仅会导致以太坊的碳排放和币释放量的大幅下跌。很多人没有意识到的是，它完全消除了卖出压力，因为验证者的提款会在下一次升级才开放。然后社区开启了关于合并后交易费用和锁仓的 32 个 ETH 会发去哪个地址。Tim Beiko 对这个问题进行了回应：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FrAMDbQFPazA7DQQ_faj9.png?height=681&width=597)\n\n这一点没有写在规范上：合并后，EVM 的执行保持不变，因此出块者仍然可以设自己想要的 coinbase (余额地址) (像今天的矿工一样)。这与验证者获得解锁的区块提议奖励是不同的。也就是说，验证者奖励是发往验证者，而交易费是发往区块提议者指定的余额地址，它可以是任意以太坊地址。\n\n来源：\n\n[https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1448334011324055563?s=20](https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1448334011324055563?s=20)\n\n# **执行层 (Eth1)**\n\n## EIP-1559 要出修改版？\n\n在 10 月 30 日举行的第 125 次以太坊核心开发者会议，研究员 @adietrichs 详细介绍了 EIP-4396：Time-Aware Base Fee Calculation (关注时间的基本费用计算方案)，旨在克服当前使用区块 gas 使用量作为指标存在的缺陷。目前 EIP-1559 的缺陷如下：\n\n* 合并后，slot 间的间隔是固定的 12 秒，不同于 PoW 大约 13 秒的间隔。但如果错失了一个 slot，区块间的时间就增加一倍，即使需求是没有变的 (例如，连续两个 100% 满的区块 vs. 一个空 slot +一个200%满的区块)。也就是说根据当前的更新规则，会发出一个虚假的需求峰期信号，从而导致小型不合理的基本费用峰期。\n* 个别错过的 slot 的更严重问题可能由共识问题引起，因为 EIP-1559 只允许有 2 倍的区块容量弹性，如果错过的 slot 超过 2 个，它将阻止很大一部分区块提议者继续出块，这些情况会导致平均区块时间明显变长，从而以同样的倍率降低链的吞吐量。\n\n因此，@adietrichs 提议应该以单位时间内稳定的吞吐量而不是以区块为指标，在计算基本费用时使用区块时间。\n\n对于这份 EIP，与会的开发者展开了很长的讨论，主要的争议点在于信息泄露，即共识层上的 slot 信息可以透露多少给执行层，两者有越紧的挂钩，它们就越难各自独立更新。\n\n由于这个 EIP 关乎是纳入合并还是在上海硬分叉的问题，开发者们计划这周举行会议进行深入探讨。\n\nEIP-4396 :\n\n[https://github.com/quilt/EIPs/blob/time-aware-basefee/EIPS/eip-4396.md](https://github.com/quilt/EIPs/blob/time-aware-basefee/EIPS/eip-4396.md)\n\n来源：\n\n[https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1454191295795130371?s=20](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1454191295795130371?s=20)\n\n## 通往无状态以太坊之路——Verkle Tries\n\n在第 125 次以太坊核心开发者会议上，研究员@dankrad 和 @gballet 介绍了让以太坊走向无状态的路线图，重点通过 Verkle Tries 来实现。\n\n根据 Tim Beiko 的记录，他们解释到，通往无状态以太坊的其中一个大障碍是，在节点不需要存储网络完整状态的范式里，节点上“缺失状态”的证明 (即 witness，见证数据）的大小。如果一个节点没有某账户相关的状态但想处理该账户涉及的交易，它需要该账户确实存在及具有它所声称的余额/存储的证明。为了生成这些证明，你需要检索存储在 Merkle Patricia 树 (MPT) 里的以太坊状态。每个账户都存储在树分支的叶子上，而要构建一个证明，你不仅需要分支，还需要该节点的所有同级节点。这意味着，如果我们要保留 MPT， 证明 (见证数据) 在以太坊的 p2p 网络上广播太大了，它们比区块大 10-1000 倍。\n\n而 Verkle Tries (VT) 是一种不同类型的树，可以通过它生成小得多的见证数据。简言之，如果我们想要无状态，我们就需要“轻量的”证明，也就需要更好的树结构，因此需要从 MPT 转为 VT。\n\n要从 MPT 转到 VT 并不容易，因为状态是在每个以太坊区块中访问的，将当前 MPT 转为 VT 需要多于 13 秒的时间，因此我们需要冻结链。而要是实现这点，他们提出了一个 3 步走的路线图来部署这些 VT。\n\n第 1 步：为了适应 VT，我们需要改变大量的 gas 开销和 SELFDESTRUCT 的影响。因为这些修改都很小，我们会在上海硬分叉引入。\n\n第 2 步：冻结现在的 MPT，新增一个 VT 并把所有未来的更新都写入该 VT，慢慢把更多的状态从 MPT 转移到 VT。\n\n第 3 步：把“冻结的” MPT 转为 VT。这一步有一个巧妙的地方，尽管确切的切换需要在一个网络升级区块上发生，这个转换可以提前在“链下”进行。\n\n第 2 步和第 3 步之间需要几个月，因此我们有足够的时间把我们在第 2 步冻结的 MPT 转换为 VT，并把代码写入客户端里。当第 3 步启动时，我们就已经把冻结的 MPT 转换到 VT 了。然后，客户端就可以把所有 MPT 的代码拿掉了。\n\n以下为相关资源：\n\nVerkle Tries 的演示

**Layer2**\n\n**L2 扩容解决方案 Optimism 推迟发布 OVM 2.0**\n\n此前，Optimism 团队宣布于 10 月 28 日在主网推出 OVM 2.0 版本。随后，团队又再发布声明表示，OVM 2.0 的上线主网的日期将推迟到 PST 时间 11 月 11 日早上 10:00 (即北京时间 12 日早上 2:00)。届时，Optimistic Ethereum 系统预计会有 4-6 小时的宕机时间。\n\nOVM 2.0 上线后，开发者将能够一键部署合约，大家习惯使用的工具也能在 Layer2 上运行。完整的开发更改设置：<https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/l2/changeset.html>\n\n那些一直想要部署但无法使用自定义编译器运行的项目将可以直接部署，而无需对其代码进行修改。此外，任何可以在以太坊上运行的工具都将能够在 Optimistic Ethereum 上运行。也就是说，开发者能够在 L2 上使用 DappTools、Vyper、Tenderly、Hardhat 等。而在这个版本中，Optimism 当前的安全模型不会发生任何变化 —— OE 将仍然以单个定序者的模式运行。\n\n来源：\n\n[https://twitter.com/optimismPBC/status/1455645114269724675](https://twitter.com/optimismPBC/status/1455645114269724675)\n\n关于 OVM 2.0 版本，Optimism 团队发布了文章 Introducing EVM

团队宣布正式面向公众开放无需许可的代币桥接功能。这意味着，往 Arbitrum One 桥接添加任何代币将无需许可，且默认为标准的 ERC-20 代币实现。\n\n此前，L2 扩容解决方案 Arbitrum One 主网 beta 版本于 9 月 1 日向所有终端用户开放，但在一些功能上仍保留白名单限制 (如向 Arbitrum 的跨链桥接添加新的代币)。之所以这么做，是因为帮助确保项目获得适合其需求的代币类型：当桥接代币至 Arbitrum 时，L2 上的代币合约要么是标准 ERC-20 代币合约 (Standard ERC-20，支持基本的 ERC-20 功能以及在 L1 和 L2 之间的可传输性)，要么是自定义 ERC-20 合约 (Custom Gateway，可以与任何其他功能如治理、快照功能等一起部署)。Arbitrum 表示：如果桥接了某个标准的 ERC-20 代币之后，项目方随后选择创建一个自定义的 ERC-20 实现，我们就会得到同一个代币的不同实现。这虽然不会造成安全风险，但这带来了复杂性和不便，我们希望尽可能避免。因而，代币桥接功能的白名单限制将保留至 10 月 22 日。\n\n默认情况下，L1 上任何未注册到 Arbitrum 桥接网关的 ERC20 代币都可以无需许可地桥接至标准 ERC-20 代币合约网关。桥接代币至 L2

2 日，以太坊域名服务系统 ENS 宣布即将实行去中心化治理，并通过 DAO 和发行 ENS 治理代币将 ENS 的治理权移交给社区。具体来说，就是希望将 ENS 根的多签权移交给社区，社区的治理范围包括 ENS 金库以及其未来基金的控制权、.ETH 域名注册合约 (负责管理 .ETH 域名的定价和注册机制) 的控制权。对于 ENS DAO 来说，第一个要做的事情就是正式向 ENS 根多签密钥持有者请求获得上述控制权。\n\n此外，用户可以从 11 月 2 日开始申请成为 ENS 治理代表。ENS 治理代币将于 11 月 8 日开放申领 (空投域名快照已经于 11 月 1 日进行)，用户必须在 2022 年 5 月 4 日之前完成代币申领，否则将返回至 DAO 金库。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uXnLtCcDMZSL0bIxUbLEF.png?height=658&width=1284)\n\nENS 发行总量为 1 亿枚，总供应量的 25% 将空投给 .ETH 域名持有者 (> 13.7 万个地址)；25% 将分配给 ENS 贡献者 (>100 名个人和团队，加上数百名 Discord 用户)；剩下的 50% 将分配给 DAO 社区金库。\n\n其中，25% 空投给用户的规则为：分配给曾经注册过或目前有效的 .ETH 二级域名注册地址，空投权重按账户而非域名数量计算，公式为 0.27 乘以至少持有 1 个 ENS 域名的天数，再加上 0.067 乘以距离域名到期的天数（最多 8 年），如果账户额外设置了反向解析，则会将上述结果再乘以 2。\n\n来源：\n\n[https://twitter.com/ensdomains/status/1455283001248698376](https://twitter.com/ensdomains/status/1455283001248698376)\n\n**麦当劳也发 NFT？**\n\n麦当劳美国 (McDonald's USA) 首次推出有限的 NFT，以纪念其三明治

Through the bonding service, these protocols accumulate the crucial infrastructural liquidity that they generally service via liquidity mining. Instead of renting that liquidity (often at astronomical interest rates), they simply purchase it, turning a value-draining perpetual expense into revenue-producing assets that facilitate the functionality of the rest of the platform.\n\nOur team provides infrastructure, expertise, and exposure to a vibrant marketplace.

Despite the hype and the consensus among the crypto community that crypto-gaming is the future, we’ve encountered both nebulous explanations of its benefits and legitimate arguments by established gamers as to why it will not work. We want to address both and discuss through the lens of our personal experiences and frustrations with games symbolic of our 2000s childhoods, six reasons why crypto will change gaming. We hope to propose novel applications or ideas in each section and provide a brief overview of existing arguments.\n\nAs always, if you’ve enjoyed this article please follow us on Twitter @terry15chung and @stingrayL0.\n\nThis article builds on and is inspired by, “[Into the Void: Where Crypto Meets the Metaverse](https://metaversed.net/263f1ff8c13c455ea472f5689e01acaa)” - we credit sections 1, 2, and 3 to this article. If you would like a more comprehensive overview of pillars 1, 2, and 3, we highly suggest reading this article first. Our [previous work on Axie](https://blockchain.mirror.xyz/sJzrBcsV-R700iMZ72hQeCrHgC_8NqT4senqCFXJRPg) also touches on this as well - check out the section titled “It's Just a Game”.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n* Definitions and Background\n* Pillar 1: Asset Ownership\n* Pillar 2: Transactions and Payments\n* Pillar 3: Interoperability\n* Pillar 4: Game Governance\n* Pillar 5: Reward Contributors\n* Pillar 6: Open Source\n* Redefining the Future of Work?\n\n## Tl;dr\n\n**Pillar 1: Asset Ownership**\n\n* NFTs allow you to keep in-game items even if the game shuts down\n* Self-custody means you can use it in other interoperable projects\n* NFTs can represent rights to access a game + other perks that give new monetization models to game devs\n* NFTs tell a story through the provable history of ownership that can make gameplay more immersive.\n\n**Pillar 2: Transactions and Payments**\n\n* Trustless marketplaces distribute margin from large marketplaces and sellers to individual sellers\n* RMT without fear of fraud.\n\n**Pillar 3: Interoperability**\n\n* Content and tokens can be interoperable - NFTs in one game can have representation in others.\n\n**Pillar 4: Game Governance**\n\n* Games allow provable on-chain proof of participation\n* This allows the creation of new governance models that address the issues with coin-voting, that make tradeoffs between Sybil resistance and plutocracy\n* This proof of participation model can be tweaked to solve for gerontocracy or account buying (more on this model later).\n\n**Pillar 5: Reward Contributors**\n\n* With crypto, we can now reward contributors with currency native to the game.\n* This is also important in rewarding developers, marketers, and other contributors to the protocol if the game is fully decentralized.\n\n**Pillar 6: Open Source**\n\n* Because blockchain games are open source, they can be forked to return to previous versions\n* This, combined with decentralized game governance allows organic dissipation of the incessant pressure to update for game developers.\n\n**Redefining the Future of Work?**\n\n* Through having a global system that is not disadvantageous to smaller players, we can provide meaningful wages to those who satisfy the demand for in-game currency or assets\n* Crypto-gaming can help alleviate the geographical lottery in ways that even working in regional software businesses cannot\n* Finally, we hope that there isn’t an over-finalization of gaming as the ultimate purpose is still to have fun. We should use NFTs and crypto to add immersion and never forget that the end goal is to build enjoyable consumer experiences.\n\n**Background:**\n\nWe want to start by first clarifying the differences between how we will use the terms “NFT Gaming”, and “Blockchain Gaming”.\n\nNFT Games have in-game assets that are NFTs. Just because a game incorporates NFTs, does not necessarily mean its game logic runs on a blockchain, or that it is decentralized. Similarly, games could decide to issue tokens and decentralize but omit NFTs altogether.\n\n“Blockchain games” host their game logic directly on public blockchains. Congruently, it does not have to incorporate NFTs or have a crypto-currency tied to the ecosystem (you get the point).\n\nWe will refer to games that use any blockchain technology as “crypto-games”.\n\nNote: Because this space is so new, our general definitions will probably have changed by this time next year. NFTs are social by nature, so our discussion focuses exclusively on multiplayer games.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Pillar 1: Asset Ownership\n\n2008 - I had just made some friends after moving to a new school. A bunch of us boys was hanging out in front of my best friend’s computer during a sleepover where we came across...\n\n![“Looks fun - could use a break from Age of Empires 2”](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pQLA5hGzOfiVrebzA08KB.jpg?height=379&width=500)\n\nBy 2010 we were still throwing snowballs at the basketball hoop as we complained about our homework that day. We had our Secret Agent Badge and Black Belt proudly equipped for all to see. Hanging out in Club Penguin was definitely a highlight of my lower-school years.\n\nEarly 2017, I had just found out that Club Penguin was shutting down a month later (March 2017). So my friends and I logged in one last time to shoot some snowballs at the basketball court while we threatened to report anyone who dared try to type “Idiot” with our Special Agent privileges.\n\n### Losing Games and Game Items\n\nWhether it’s a mount in WoW or my Puffle and igloo in Club Penguin losing in game-assets is an upsetting experience that is, unfortunately, the fact of life. Whether it’s the dozens of Reddit pages and forums, there are people frustrated with losing items in their games or MMOs [that have closed down over the years](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2021/09/best-mmos-shut-down-online/). Losing something they spent so much time, effort, and money to acquire. This is especially true in the case of MMORPGs, where people built whole identities and communities around their account, only for those to disappear when the game became unprofitable to maintain for the studio.\n\n![:(](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ci-6N94UQGDzUN8vsePEx.PNG?height=237&width=738)\n\nHere's an example of the unthinkable becoming reality: an MMO that [disappeared overnight.](https://www.engadget.com/2011-11-15-hangame-mmo-accidentally-deleted-shut-down-forever.html)\n\n### So How Does Crypto Help?\n\nIf my Puffle or Penguin avatar had been an NFT, it could exist independently of whether Disney shuts Club Penguin down or not. If other games or individual users so desired, these NFTs could still have use-cases (see Pillar 3, 6) from user spun-up derivative games/experiences.\n\nTo better understand this dynamic and why it is important (past your experience with Club Penguin) check out “[Into the Void: Where Crypto Meets the Open Metaverse.](https://metaversed.net/263f1ff8c13c455ea472f5689e01acaa)”\n\nIn this section, we want to build on the article above to muse about additional use-cases on how in-game asset ownership can transform gaming.\n\n### Buying and Selling of Games (Again)\n\nAccessing games through a DRM (Digital Rights Management) platform like Steam or Microsoft Store means you get a license to play games through their server. [You don’t actually own the game.](https://www.techradar.com/news/pc-game-ownership-in-the-digital-age-what-do-you-do-in-a-post-ownership-age)\n\nI remember the good old days when I traded my Smash Bros for a Blazing Angels CD. Every CD and cartridge that my friends had, was also another game I had access to - when we were bored of playing one game, we were happy to sell, swap, and gift it to each other.\n\n[https://twitter.com/jking215/status/1450444140072865794?s=25](https://twitter.com/jking215/status/1450444140072865794?s=25)\n\nToday, I have over 120 games on Steam, and I have no idea what to do with them. I can't sell, lease or gift them on a game-by-game basis nor can I sell my Steam account since it contains sensitive personal information and breaks TOS (terms of service). And frankly, there is a level of confusion about having just “purchased” something and being told that I cannot do anything with it past playing the game; [it seems like we aren’t the only ones following this train of logic.](https://www.vg247.com/steam-users-right-to-sell-games-french-court-valve-ruling)\n\nYet Steam can’t put it more directly that you *do not* in fact own the game. [From Steam’s TOS:](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/)\n\n> Valve hereby grants, and you accept, a non-exclusive license and right, to use the Content and Services for your personal, non-commercial use…\n>\n> All title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in and to the Content and Services and any and all copies thereof are **owned by Valve…**\n>\n> You are entitled to use the Content and Services for your own personal use, but **you are not entitled to (i) sell, grant a security interest in, or transfer reproductions** of the Content and Services to other parties in any way, **nor to rent, lease or license the Content and Services to others…**\n\nInstead of digital licenses, NFTs could be used to authenticate access to a game. This is already the case for Axie Infinity, where you must own 3 Axies to play. You’re then allowed to sell, gift, breed…etc those Axies anytime you wish. This now means that you can resell access to your old games, buy games on the secondary market, and lend/rent access to games through NFT renting protocols like [reNFT](https://www.renft.io/).\n\nSo perhaps before you purchase a game you want to try playing it for a while, or you’re finally finished with a game and want to resell it at market prices. Perhaps you want to create social communities around verified ownership of some game, or even guilds with requirements of verification of on-chain data about your in-game status (levels, land-possession, faction allegiance...etc). **With NFTs representing in-game assets, or replacing digital licenses, you unlock a richer user experience around gaming.**\n\n### But what about the Game Developers\n\nIf everyone could just buy/sell/trade their games with someone else, then how are they going to make money?\n\nFirst, NFTs can create new monetization models. Game developers can embed NFTs with a royalty fee so that each time in-game assets get traded, they (or a designated address - a treasury) automatically receive the fees. The same idea applies if the NFT assets represent ownership of the game itself. Axie relies on this model and is one of the top revenue-generating games of 2021.\n\n[https://twitter.com/santiagoroel/status/1442496732458221581](https://twitter.com/santiagoroel/status/1442496732458221581)\n\nFurthermore, game developers can offer additional interoperable experiences, lowering the cost barrier for new players while increasing price discrimination. Imagine a game studio that has developed a large game and many mini-games that all can be played entirely independently of each other. These games are related and are all part of a core story/game universe. Purchasing NFT A could allow players to access A mini-game, but they must buy NFT B if they want to access the B mini-game...etc. If they decide that they like what they’re playing, then they could buy the more expensive NFT Z. The different NFTs that I now own can now act as either unique characters, passes to enter certain areas in the big game, or be combined/composed into unique items while still providing access to the different minigames that are part of the same core universe.\n\nThe difference between this and the current DLC model is that each NFT is independent of one another. If the area that A NFT unlocks in the main game is no longer interesting to a player, they could sell that NFT individually. Or if they no longer have the time to play games, they could sell everything except for NFT A which to them is the most fun and least time-consuming.\n\nThese NFTs also don’t have to be as expensive as DLCs or purchasing games today. With new post-purchase monetization models available to game studios, initial purchase prices could be even lower than DLCs today.\n\n### Capturing Value\n\nWhat is valuable in a game?\n\nPerhaps it's “whatever lets us have the most fun”, but with that, we turn into the realm of subjectivity. A gorgeous-looking sword with mediocre stats may be welcomed by a more aesthetically conscious player but frowned upon by a stat-only player who wants the best gear.\n\n![Classic Dilemma](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EJsgjt_WY8j1UAKhIJeFE.jpg?height=480&width=640)\n\nWe conjecture that with in-game items the 4 main factors that contribute to “what is valuable” are authenticity, scarcity, utility, and story.\n\nAuthenticity, utility, and scarcity are generally well captured in the current gaming environment. If you know that a legendary item is super powerful, has a low drop rate, and is useful to you, you probably spend a lot of effort obtaining it and purchasing it at a high price, and because games today are closed environments, the question of authenticity is trivial.\n\nHowever, the value of the story, in our opinion, isn’t captured well at all. For example, when you buy an art piece, the curator can usually provide historical background on the piece, like whether its previous owner was someone famous, a crazy story of how it was rediscovered, or a story behind its creation. These stories are what sometimes make art valuable and engaging - when you purchase a piece, you aren’t just buying its visual representation, but its historical context (where and how it was made), its lineage (which walls it has hung on), and its overall story.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_DRNbpsU3Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_DRNbpsU3Q)\n\n**Unfortunately, stories like this are rarely captured in in-game assets on a noticeable level, which we believe is a massive missed opportunity.** Imagine how valuable it would be for some hardcore fans of Hiko to find out they were buying was the exact StatTrak P2000 Corticera skin he used to execute the [inhuman reaction headshot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFGpLdGEL9k) But more importantly imagine the level of immersion this can bring into gameplay - the level of pride at owning the exact skin used by Faker, the exact whip used by Durial321 during the Fally massacre (this point is expanded upon in Pillar 5). **Because the history of ownership is easily verifiable, items take on a story and a lineage, increasing its value but also creating more immersive experiences in gameplay.**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acKvztQu8Zg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acKvztQu8Zg)\n\nAn example of the power of story in creating immersive experiences around gaming: the Runescape Party Hat - “one of the most iconic items in the history of modern video games”\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Pillar 2: Transactions and Payments\n\nBesides ownership of in-game assets, the ability to transact trustlessly on blockchain infrastructure could be a solution for problems that revolve around gray markets and RMT [(Real Money Trading)](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/privacy-2/2021/09/gamers-beware-the-risks-of-real-money-trading-rmt-explained/). As presented in “[Into the Void](https://metaversed.net/263f1ff8c13c455ea472f5689e01acaa)” we assume RMT to be an inevitable byproduct of demand for in-game assets and build off that assumption.\n\n### Distribute Margin\n\nThe CSGO skin trade is a multi-billion dollar market that lacks transparency despite its popularity, size, and efforts to regulate it. The market isn’t the wild wild west anymore compared to pre-2018 thanks to greater oversight and regulation from Valve, but there still are plenty of fishy[ third-party sites](https://gist.github.com/MRuy/a3a64bc870a320864557) that are made to scam unaware buyers.\n\n![CSGOSkins](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_MlSl1Z2fIWbu64TOAyFI.png?height=601&width=1164)\n\nA safer bet would be to trade on the Steam Marketplace, which is far more secure and popular. However, Steam Wallet has a limit of $2,000 (so all trades cannot exceed it), a hefty 15% fee, and money gained from trading MUST stay in the Steam ecosystem. If you want to cash out to fiat or have an item(s) worth more than $2000 to sell, you would need to head back to those aforementioned third-party sites. And while many do offer legitimate trading services, the more legitimate they are, the higher fees they tend to command and the greater the likelihood you will need to complete KYC verification and link your account with Steam. What we see is a centralization to Steam’s marketplace and a select number of marketplaces that have high taxes and tactics to force you to stay in the Steam ecosystem.\n\nBecause blockchains already have developed infrastructure around secure transactions, marketplaces built atop public blockchains don’t need as much capital investment to maintain security. Hence, they’re able to distribute the margin they need to maintain profitability to the end-users, greatly lowering their take rate (marketplace fees on Opensea are 2.5%). Whereas in the past, Valve had to spend money validating transactions, responding to customer service requests, and building market infrastructure, public blockchains, and open source marketplace contracts already take care of all of these features (in fact just sell them on Opensea). Authenticity verification of NFTs is much easier via reading its metadata, restricting the possibility of scams by creating listing requirements on the platform.\n\nCrypto can also bring transparency to the RMT process. First, crypto-games by definition have adjacent marketplaces where buying and selling of in-game crypto assets take place. By accepting this as a feature of the game, the game can spin up its own marketplace and decrease player reliance on potentially fraudulent third-party websites. Second, through a listing mechanism where the product is automatically delivered upon receipt of payment, and/or through a DEX for in-game currency, crypto can enable better price discovery and trustless transactions.\n\nInterestingly, RMT sellers would also gain from adopting crypto. Current RMT sellers have to deal with credit card fraud, disputed charges, and merchant fees which take substantial chunks of their profits.\n\n### Dilution of Prestige\n\nA common criticism with embracing RMT is that it dilutes the amount of dedication a player put in to acquire a rare in-game asset if an RMTer could buy it at the click of a button. NFTs, via on-chain verifiable histories, make available to the public who it was that obtained (minted) the item. This can then act as social currency within the game.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Pillar 3: Interoperability\n\nBeyond the fact that the Smash Bros franchise is both a great party and competitive fighting game, we believe a factor in its immense success is how it allows characters from different franchises to interact. It’s in people’s nature to compare characters between different stories (Gandalf vs Dumbledore) and debate how a fight or interaction might shake out - to see it happen in-game satisfies that demand. People also find it fun when their favorite celebrities or fandoms collide and produce new content; scratching that ‘what if‘ scenario in the back of our heads. But because of our current gaming infrastructure, the majority of games are siloed in their own franchises and aren’t able to scratch that itch.\n\n![A well-visited screen](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-ZFFqnyWtZJfQUxBOt4rH.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\n### Content Interoperability\n\nGames like Smash Bros and Kingdom Hearts are in the minority. **We believe that players are missing out on a whole new way to experience their games with closed-end ecosystems while developers are missing out on new ways to monetize and promote their games.** Meanwhile, Fornite *has* realized this potential and is not afraid to take steps towards integrating other games/media outside of its universe, like the introduction of Kratos from the God of War franchise or John Wick as an example.\n\n![Fortnite](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4aOlt_g_AXKX0axrWcRG0.jpg?height=675&width=1080)\n\nNFTs can open the flood gates to interoperability between games. In so far as a game develops a representation of the NFT in their game, users will be able to integrate any NFT they desire. An NFT that represents a playable character or item in one game, could be a cosmetic skin or land in another. **Not every NFT will need to be playable or have representation in-game (this is infeasible due to cost and game-design issues), but the fact that one in-game item can exist in another even just as a cosmetic piece can be powerful in terms of the partnerships and hype it can bring.**\n\nBecause of the increased interoperability, players can also experience new ways to use the assets they own without needing to buy a new game. For example, if a Medieval MMORPG formed a partnership with a 5v5 NFT brawl game, the NFT character that I bought for the MMO could be used in the brawl game as well, effectively increasing my total playtime per item bought. Imagine the implications here for a game like Smash Bros.\n\nIt's exciting to see that these partnerships that will set the foundation of interoperability in NFT games are already being formed. [Wararena](https://www.warena.io/) and Iluvium’s [recent decision ](https://teamwarena.medium.com/warena-partners-with-illuvium-will-look-to-cross-metaverse-db17dd49533e)to form a partnership to solidify cross-compatibility is great, and we believe that the more games that are currently being developed with NFTs become interconnected, the sooner we can start building an open metaverse.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8SEavoH6ljSm7F98i8uOZ.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\n### Economic Interoperability\n\nAfter converting cash into V-bucks (Fortnite) or Steam wallet dollars, there currently is no way to withdraw it back to fiat, nor send it to another platform (assuming 2 weeks have passed for Steam Wallet). This is an intentional and effective method to keep players invested in their platform/game and not move their purchasing power elsewhere. In the [same article mentioned earlier](https://www.vg247.com/steam-users-right-to-sell-games-french-court-valve-ruling), the lawsuit brought on by the French consumer protection group against Steam also argues that the inability for people to withdraw their money from Steam is anti-consumer behavior. Even with gift cards, one can redeem the remaining balance to fiat assuming some conditions are met.\n\nWe believe there are many other benefits that having an interchangeable currency can bring; for example:\n\n* Players now actually have more control over their assets\n  * Withdraw to Fiat\n  * Transfer tokens to another player\n* Games that use the same tokens as an in-game currency could experience a higher level of user growth since players would be more inclined to try out a new game (and pay for things in it) if they already have the underlying token to play it\n* Game shutdowns won’t wipe out in-game currency, and other games could use existing currencies in any way they see fit\n* All of this effectively increases the utility of my in-game crypto-currency\n\nOne can imagine, once the Axie SDK is open source, new Axie game modes will create more use cases for SLP and increase Axie demand.\n\nAt the end of the day, the current system works, albeit in a non-ideal way. People are aware of the irreversibility of putting cash into their Steam wallet, and they still do it anyway. We just believe that there are more consumer and game-studio-friendly alternatives available with crypto.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Pillar 4: Game Governance\n\nI vividly remember opening up another tab on Internet Explorer to furtively chop willows or AFK salmon during computer class. This was 15 years ago, and I still play today.\n\n![And no I am not maxed...](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_Lt7jD2C7O2bgWYycpXyz.png?height=496&width=759)\n\n### Nostalgia\n\nThe golden age of Runescape was RS2 pre-EOC/post wildy + free trade. (For a quick recap, RS1 had old-school graphics and limited content, RS2 had an expansion of new skills, quests, and a deeper storyline, while RS3 had a new combat mechanic (EOC) and pay-to-win micropayments that caused a community schism.)  As with most games, simply by having existed long enough the dev team ended up shipping updates that were not well received by most of the community.\n\nPost EOC (in RS3) there was such a large exodus of players that the CEO of Jagex (the developing company behind the game) put out a community *[poll](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/2007---old-school-runescape-you-vote?jptg=ia&jptv=news_archive)*, a means to previously gauge player interest around updates, to determine whether Jagex should create a retro version of the game. If it received more than 50,000 votes the retro 2007 servers would be revived, and for each additional 250,000 votes it received, this “fork” would receive extra benefits and attention from the team.\n\nHere’s an in-depth explanation of the fork:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP-GQoO8hDU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP-GQoO8hDU)\n\nThe poll proceeded to pass with 440,000 votes spawning the creation of the now more popular OSRS (old school Runescape). As one of the promised benefits at the level of interest they received, the mods created an in-game polling system, where only paying members who had a **total level above 300 and more than 25 hours of game-time** would be able to vote on significant updates, new quests, cosmetics, and items. Only if the vote passed with more than 75% yes votes would the updates be implemented in-game. These polls are detailed, giving users the leeway to vote on the creation of new game modes, [cosmetics](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Poll:Design_A_Hat_Art_Competition_-_Finalists), and different [stats a game item possesses](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Poll:Equipment_Rebalance:_Ranged_Meta).\n\n![Poll Booth](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VSO-V5qDwevYxLXEP2bLd.png?height=288&width=511)\n\nThough widely supported by the community, this rollback also erased 6 years’ worth of content from 2007-2013. Today I would give anything to be able to go back to 2008 and finish “While Guthix Sleeps” on my original RS account, but alas the quest is now part of RS3, and my new OSRS character no longer has access to the quests I dreamt of completing in my childhood.\n\n### The Overarching Issue\n\nAll of these aforementioned issues stemmed from unilateral updates that the devs shipped without community input. We were members of a game without any say in how it progressed despite having sunk our time, money, and soul into it. Despite our willingness to do so, there was no way for users to contribute to further game development post-roll-back - to restore our favorite quests, or decide on which year to roll back the servers to.\n\n> I happily played World of Warcraft during 2007-2010, but one day Blizzard removed the damage component from my beloved warlock’s Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. I soon decided to quit. - Vitalik Buterin\n\nBut, at the end of the day, none of this is the core dev teams’ fault. They are under a catch-22 pressure, where unless there are new updates and content, players leave for newer pastures; but if there are too many updates, players grumble about balance and ruining the game. It is in their incentive structure to continue to ship updates at break-neck speeds. That is until one of the updates ends up as unpopular as EOC.\n\nAnd why restore to the 2007 version? - that was the only version that they could find that was [backed up in the company ](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:2007_-_Old_School_RuneScape..._You_Vote!)hard drive.\n\n### Issues with the Rollback / Voting System\n\nBy requiring that any update pass a plurality vote, OSRS gives the community the power to decide on how the game will progress. The polling system is by design conservative, making it unlikely that any large system altering update (like EOC) gets passed without scrutiny, and though voter participation is low, issues of particular interest (Group Ironman, adding new skills) do get much higher turnout than other polls (10% of player base or 2x DAU).\n\nAt the very least this can stop the degeneration of the game into an unrecognizable hodge-podge of overlapping updates. On the other hand, the plurality requirement and low voter turnout pit opinionated conservationists against people that want to see further developments in OSRS.\n\nThis opinionated minority effectively has the power to block all new updates that greatly alter the game. This puts people like me who valued RS2 in an odd position. We weren’t around to feel nostalgic and maximalist about preserving the classic nature of 2007 Runescape, yet we are also unwilling to go WoW in neighboring RS3. We want, and to this day fight for, a dynamically moving OSRS with our favorite quests, new items, and skills. Yet each successive time there is a vote to alter the 75% plurality requirement or updates that meaningfully alter the game, they are struck down by the minority.\n\nAn example of this conservative blocking power was in the failure of a new skill warding to pass the polls. Read about it briefly [here](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Warding). It failed with a yes vote of 66%, showing that a plurality requirement can create a static game.\n\nAnother disadvantage of the OSRS voting model is that it is prone to bot attacks (Sybil attacks). It’s easy for bots to create new accounts, and without detection, achieve 25 hours of gameplay plus a total level of 300. Though the ease of doing so decreases exponentially per hour played, (for example if the % likelihood of getting banned per hour of botting gameplay is 0.1%, then there is a 10% chance of getting banned in the first 100 hours) with current bot detection systems, it is more than likely that they can form a voting bloc that casts the deciding vote.\n\nRight now there is little incentive for RMTers and bot farmers to actively participate in the polls as most of the ballot items do not impact botting income, but if governance decisions had a direct impact on the price of associated tokens and items in-game then bot attacks become very costly.\n\n![A bot farm in the wildy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z9KX89GbOimwRasGihnw4.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nFinally, the OSRS model has no formal way for players to originate ideas. It has happened before that a popular forum post, filtered and edited by the devs, landed on a poll, but this is a rare occurrence.\n\n### Are NFT games able to Solve these problems?\n\nFrankly, we’re not sure! But we at least believe that the opportunity set of possible experiments is so vast that somewhere we will be able to find solutions to mitigate, if not solve these issues.\n\nThe pressure to constantly update will still exist but can be organically dissipated by community-driven content and decentralized governance. The exact version of the game the community desires can be retrieved at all times and run by any member that desires to do so, and more sophisticated polling systems than the one used by OSRS can be used/experimented with to target specific results.\n\n### Decentralized Governance\n\nFor a quick overview of what blockchain governance is check out this link. For a more in-depth introduction, we suggest the [Crypto Canon: Governance ](https://a16z.com/2018/02/10/crypto-readings-resources/)section.\n\nA reductive explanation would be that crypto-based communities, often organized around a particular project with its own token, are operated by governance systems where instead of a singular centralized entity making decisions (in this example think Jagex unilaterally pushing updates) there exists some form of voting or social consensus system among its users, community members and token holders. Within predefined bounds, changes to the protocol/application must pass a vote. Think about how in OSRS players that meet a certain threshold can vote for proposals that directly affect the game.\n\n### DeGov Unique to Crypto Games\n\nGaming, in particular, gives us access to primitives that allow the creation of new crypto-governance models. We hope to propose a rough blueprint of such a model that addresses issues within gaming and existing crypto-governance using unique qualities only available in games.\n\n### Existing Issues with Crypto-Governance\n\nThe predominant crypto-governance model is some form of coin-voting. Those who possess tokens can cast or delegate votes which are then weighed depending on the protocol’s governance specifications. Coin governance is prone to bribing, plutocracy and must implement additional measures to safeguard itself from predatory financial interests - quadratic voting being a prime example. It also fails to represent interests besides token holders. For a comprehensive overview check out Vitalik’s blog post - [Beyond Coin Governance](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html).\n\nAs mentioned in his article, a solution to the issues of coin-voting is non-coin-driven governance of which one branch - that doesn’t involve KYC - is “proof of participation”.\n\n> Proof of participation: systems that attest to the fact that some account corresponds to a person that has participated in some event, passed some educational training, or performed some useful work in the ecosystem. See POAP for one attempt to implement thus. - Vitalik\n\nIn existing protocols tangibly measuring proof of participation is a challenging issue. However, within a game, there are easily provable ways of verifying participation and subsequently weighing this participation.\n\n### Proof of Participation Voting Mechanisms\n\nOne immediate metric we can take as a proxy to participation is the total level of a character.\n\nFor instance, we could easily envision an extension of the OSRS model, where only members who have played more than X hours and have met certain leveling conditions get to vote and propose new items on the ballot.\n\nBut from there we could extend the voting mechanism with ideas brought over from coin-voting. The number of votes delegated to a user per voting round could scale at:\n\n```\n                          (X-S)^n\n```\n\nwhere x is the on-chain verifiable level, s is a phase shift that guarantees adequate Sybil resistance, and n is some constant (or piecewise changing), whereby the more total levels you have the more votes you earn, rewarding established players who verifiably have put time and effort into the game over newer users. With this simple model, we’ve engaged in a tradeoff between Sybil resistance in voting and plutocracy. **However for an optimized s and n, given a high enough % chance of being banned per time botted, we could minimize the effects of bot-attacks that sway key governance decisions, or at the very least cause it to be temporally infeasible for bot accounts to overcome actual user’s decisions**. The disadvantages of such a model would be that it could establish a gerontocracy as voting power pools in existing players which would incentivize account selling.  (Similar to this proof of playtime model is YGG’s token distribution model, where governance tokens are distributed to those who complete quests and contribute more to the community. We do not yet know how they will measure, verify contribution or decide on the number of rewards issued upon completion of those quests. Check their whitepaper [here](https://yieldguild.io/YGG-Whitepaper-English.pdf).)\n\n### Solving Gerontocracy\n\nTo prevent gerontocracy we could implement a voting power decay. Taking Runescape as an example for clarity, it could be that the first season of voting after you achieve 2000 total levels you receive x amount of votes, but every subsequent year x decays at a slow linear rate, removing the power of long-time incumbents and benefiting relatively newer users as they gain more experience. This is of course offset as the older players further advance within the game and earn more voting power through achieving new milestones. Once you reach the level limit this decay could stop, rewarding the highest achieving players.\n\n![An example of how voting power could scale with time](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7Z5SdnI_XiXupz4EqlcDJ.png?height=800&width=800)\n\n### Account Buying\n\nAs for large-scale account buying, we could implement the solution adopted by Axie Infinity. Because each character is an NFT with on-chain levels, we could easily have the level reset upon any transfer. (Axie progress resets upon each account transfer).\n\n![Consequence for Transfering](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FXIkJWTBkQBslDtGVcT61.PNG?height=318&width=466)\n\nAnother solution would be to make the NFT representing your playable account non-transferable. This would equate large-scale account buying to large-scale purchasing of private keys - entailing its own security and coordination costs. Because private keys are also unalterable, the seller can still access the account post-sale, further discouraging large-scale account buying. (We are currently working on an optimized version of the above model, testing different parameters to maximize Sybil resistance. Catch us in another post soon!)\n\n### Coin Voting + Proof of Playtime\n\nHaving established a proof-of-playtime voting system, we can combine it with existing coin-voting to give representation to overlapping but different constituencies. The weighing of these two votes could be ossified to outline the key governance values of the game. One can imagine a scenario where coin holders represent ⅓ of the voting power while proof of playtime voters control the rest, leading to the ability of coin-voters to sway important decisions, but not be the deciding factor in altering the game that the players invest their money, time and soul into.\n\n### Why not Off-chain?\n\nOne of the key reasons decentralized voting becomes necessary is that there can be times when the dev team (if there is a centralized team developing the game) and the community are in opposition to one another. With current games, besides the occasional dissatisfaction with an update, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. The community is the main source of revenue for the dev team, and alienating too many can come at the cost of their livelihood.\n\nHowever, one can imagine a blockchain game where the assets and tokens associated with it have become so valuable that despite the community’s desire in changing gameplay, it is in the best interest of the devs to preserve the value of their initial allocation over anything else.\n\nIf a governing proposal benefits the players at the expense of the token price, then a vote where correct execution is guaranteed and the votes and outcome cannot be tampered with by the team, is important.\n\nThough not immediately congruent, we can take a look at Axie Infinity, where the majority of scholar-players want some form of an Axie sink and higher SLP breeding requirements to raise the price of SLP, while it is in the team’s best interest to only marginally maintain acceptable yields and breeding profitability to increase the size of their player base.\n\n### Illuvium Improvement Proposal-4: A Case Study\n\nIlluvium is a current work-in-progress game that is positioning itself as the first AAA game to be built on IMX on Ethereum. It’s an open-world RPG, where players collect creatures (Illuvials) and use them to battle other players in an Auto-Chess game mode. This game is the first of its dev-size and popularity in the crypto space that has already implemented some form of decentralized governance. ILV holders get to vote for representatives on the Illuvium Council and delegate their vote to the person of their choice. Council members can then debate and vote on proposals submitted by token holders such as but not limited to:\n\n* Balance Changes\n* Expansion Packs\n* Character Sets\n* Monster Spawn Rates\n* Marketplace Fees\n\nAnd there are already early signs that the system can generate good results. A proposal was successfully passed to disallow locked tokens belonging to seed investors to qualify for staking rewards.\n\nThis change was to “substantially increase the APY of both pools, which will incentivize new users to purchase and stake ILV” and remove possibilities of “potentially harming the decentralization of the project”[ (the whole proposal).](https://github.com/IlluviumGame/IIPs/blob/master/iips/iip-4.md) This change was enacted to avoid plutocracy as stakers with locked tokens could also generate more ILV from yield farming, which would centralize their holdings and push smaller stakers and farmers out of the loop.\n\nThe passing of this proposal shows that the DAO can sacrifice short-term benefits for long-term objectives. It’s even more significant since it had a substantial (short-term) financial impact on the founding and then-current holders ILV, and the fact it reneged on some promises made to seed investors. It was a win for the longevity of the game, and I think the meteoric rise in the price of ILV since[ April ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/illuvium/)somewhat reflects that.\n\nI reached out to the person who suggested the change, and here is what he had to say:\n\n![Our Conversation on Discord](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ya0PW0jwJmMq5ZQhGivN9.PNG?height=452&width=1564&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=large)\n\n### So is it all worth it?\n\nShould the core community of players and stakeholders in a game be able to self-govern (self-originated ideas, vote) in a way that is less susceptible to bot attacks (than existing game governance) and plutocracy (than coin-voting) via implementing a proof of play-time mechanism?  Frankly, we’re not sure. We still don’t know if the mechanism can achieve adequate Sybil resistance, and how to implement a decentralized bot-banner.\n\nBut as we were writing this article, Riot Games’ unanimous decision to remove the /all chat (RIP 2009-2021) in patch 11.21 without ANY sort of warning to or consulting of the player base demonstrates the one-sided development of games. From general discussions, it seems while most people believe Riot came with good intentions, they have focused their energy entirely in the wrong place and are out of touch. Many believe that Riot should be focused on developing better software and features that detect the consistent bad actors (repeat AFKers, Trollers, Heavy Profanity Users, etc.) and implement more appropriate punishments accordingly while rewarding good behavior.\n\nWhile I’m sure making a comprehensive judicial system for the world’s most popular game isn’t easy, I also think the amount of time they’ve had surely would have been enough to come up with something better. In a decentralized system, I think players would have voted for the implementation of a better judicial system and malicious-behavior detection software a long time ago, and Riot games would have had to implement it, or at least not pull this nonsense of banning the beloved /all chat that solves basically nothing.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tttOFQdvB4_mEh1qY3-wr.png?height=238&width=523)\n\nEDIT: [Seems like Riot has heard the crowd (thankfully) last minute, the ban is now limited to certain regions with a 2 patch duration ](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/patch-11-21-notes/)to test the efficacy of the ban\n\nThere are large tradeoffs to community governance and a game controlled by its users may end up shipping developments at the whim of its community that ends up ruining the long-term prospects of the game anyways. But at the end of the day\n\n> “Democracy is the worst form of government – except for all the others that have been tried.”\n\nThis form of game development may be less fluid and tend toward conservatism, but it may turn out better than the benevolent dictatorship of a core dev team. At the very least we believe that given our history it is an experiment worth trying.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Pillar 5: Reward Contributors\n\n### Reward Gamers/Content Creators\n\nOne of the core advantages of having a coin is that the protocol has a native currency to reward constituencies and contributors in such a way that their incentives are aligned with the success of the protocol itself. **Earlier contributors obtain these rewards at a lower cost basis and take on a larger risk in participating in an unproven ecosystem.** The efforts they expend to grow bring in later participants, and the price of their tokens now appreciates to reflect the increased interest in the project.\n\nThis is the system implemented by Axie Infinity. Every season, the 1000 highest ranked players are eligible to claim progressively higher AXS rewards. The highest-ranked player for season 17 earned 225 AXS, which at the time of this writing is valued at 31,000USD. This creates a feedback loop where players increasingly strive to achieve higher rankings, thus experimenting with new builds, breeding, creating guides, making videos, teaching scholars...etc overall growing the ecosystem through monetary interest, all the while rewarding its most avid players, streamers and contributors.\n\n![Leaderboard Rewards](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AINHMuduoyA9qyhJXOJhE.png?height=864&width=1162)\n\n### Reward Developers/Modders/Marketers\n\nIf a game is fully decentralized without a developing company behind it, who will maintain the game, run customer service, work on new projects, find new partnerships...etc?\n\nIn lieu of the length of the article so far and because we believe that the possible implementations of this are not unique to games, we will not touch upon it here. We suggest the following readings:\n\n<https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html> (specifically check out futarchy)\n\n<https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c>, <https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html>, or to check out index-coop DAO’s [contributor compensation process](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rIZDsJtugfISRyrmLzSNCdNiTwH-TzXcDSxrNTNLZiU/edit#gid=457128231) (thought at the moment it is centralized)\n\n[https://twitter.com/alexdphan/status/1454140309328187393?s=21](https://twitter.com/alexdphan/status/1454140309328187393?s=21)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Pillar 6: Opensource\n\nOne protection that blockchain games provide against bad governance is the ability to return the game to any specific snapshot in time.\n\nBlockchain games have publicly available contracts which run their game logic. Many games have not only published public GitHub Repos with their smart contracts, but they’ve also open-sourced the Unity client of the game, including the interface and graphical resources ([an example](https://github.com/planetarium/NineChronicles)).\n\nThus anyone can aggregate this data, decide on a specific period of time when they want to revert the game back to and alter the logic of the contracts and game assets such that it replicates a specific moment in time, then deploy this new version of the game (though at the moment at non-negligible costs). Item and token balances would not be able to be returned unless the blockchain itself is forked, but at the very least, the game would start over OSRS style. [Nine Chronicles](https://docs.nine-chronicles.com/) is an example of an open-source blockchain game.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/F6ng8ATwhFoaMCYmDuto8.jpg?height=353&width=616)\n\nBy being easy to fork, blockchain games achieve ease of exit, a core tenet of good governance. Any decisions contrary to the wishes of the community that are implemented via plutocratic interest or bot-attacks are reversible, though not at a negligible cost.\n\n### Flourishing Parallel Worlds\n\nCrypto + open source games have implications beyond governance. Modded versions of games have always been at the forefront of pushing gameplay to new frontiers and genres. In fact, some of the most popular games of all time were inspired or directly created in/as mods of other games. From user-created modes, maps to user-created in-game assets, mods defined and created many of the games we know and love today.\n\nBut mods today though suffer from increased centralization as they become more popular. As they become more popular, they often get absorbed by the original game creator. Because many of these open-source/modded games are usually not profitable and maintained by people as a side hobby or an experiment, to sustain them, this happens more often than not (Minecraft is a prominent counter-example).\n\nBecause of the previously discussed ways that blockchain can prove ownership and generate continued revenue through royalty implementations, it is possible to have an open-source game that is also able to generate continuous revenue through the sale of in-game assets for the original creator AND the modders. The modders can also be rewarded through mechanisms detailed in pillar 5.\n\nA good example where open-sourced blockchain development could have benefited a game is the development of DayZ.\n\nTLDR: DayZ was first a mod developed by an Arma 2 player. The modder took the best aspects of Arma 2 and transformed it into a survival game with zombies which became playable on an Arma 2 server. Soon there were spin-off servers that layered more mods on top of the OG DayZ mod that offered vastly different gameplay mechanics and features (PVP focused, base building, etc.) than other servers. Players naturally gravitated to the servers that contained the gameplay they liked.\n\nThen, Bohemia Interactive decided it wanted to cash in on this opportunity, so it brought in the creator of the first DayZ mod and developers from their Arma 2 team to create a stand-alone, official DayZ game. Unfortunately, the new team unilaterally decided on features that should be in the official game without even considering the different player types across the servers, which alienated most of the PVP and base building lovers. The game itself turned out to be a buggy mess, and full of features that players did not ask for.\n\nBy ignoring the different player groups that existed in the different servers as the dev team began creating the standalone, it left a vacuum that games like PUBG (Player Unknown developed a battle royale server for DayZ which was his claim to fame), Rust, and Subnautica satisfied the desire these left-over players had, which blossomed into multibillion-dollar games across new genres.\n\n![The predecessor of PUBG started as a mod of Arma 2 (Credits to HandsomeJayce on Youtube)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/B0noO2_J12D3nNniKA84-.png?height=654&width=1273)\n\nSo how and why could blockchain development benefit the development of DayZ in this scenario? Imagine a parallel universe, where Bohemia Interactive didn’t make the unilateral choices they did (think governance again), and instead from day 1 started by providing open-source tools and assets to scale those different servers. Through NFTs, they could have generated revenue from those assets as modders utilized or sold them in their own servers. **Letting those modded DayZ servers thrive and grow while continuing to provide backend support and tools would have been a much safer route to take while still financially benefiting from ecosystem expansion. And DayZ could have survived the innovator’s dilemma by seeding promising mods without ruining its potential.**\n\n# Redefining the Future of Work?\n\nI am not an economist, official or self-proclaimed. The claims I make in this section are based on reasoning alone without a background in the existing literature. If there are well-established empirical studies that support or refute these claims please send them my way! That being said I hope you have some leniency if I throw around terms without much rigor.\n\n### Wages\n\nIt seems intuitive, and I seem to recall from freshman year macroeconomics, that in a perfectly competitive world, labor market equilibrium happens when the marginal benefit from hiring another worker is equal to the wage rate. Put another way, under perfect competition in the labor market, wages for the new employee will be equal to how much value he/she can generate for the firm.\n\nOf course in the real world, nothing is perfectly competitive and there are (for some people) massive switching costs to jobs, informational asymmetry, differing market conditions, and rent-seeking behavior by corporations who use a combination of these tactics to offer lower wages than the value each worker creates. One can imagine a setting where there is an excess supply of unemployed workers, a lack of union protection, high-living costs resulting in switching costs, and general abuse of informational asymmetry - offering lower than market-rate wages, altering benefits...etc - resulting in lower wages than at theoretical equilibrium. The aggregate value produced via labor is thus captured by the firm instead of being distributed to the employee.\n\nThis often means that the world’s least connected, least educated that live in the least protected geographies with the poorest economies suffer the most from these asymmetries. But note that these conditions can happen anywhere in the world.\n\n### Does Crypto Gaming Help?\n\nWe often hear about how crypto gaming will redefine work itself - this is the fundamental mission of YGG. Gabby Dizon, CEO of YGG, posits that the question people of the future will ask is whether it's more fun to make money playing a game than it is to be an Uber driver or a construction worker - that the employment choice of the future will be between gig work and metaverse work. But this question only holds under assumptions that value created by contributors can be fully captured, or more wholly captured by the contributors themselves. If such asymmetries as mentioned above exist, then crypto gaming is just another instance of gig work outsourced to those with the least opportunities to allow value accrual to large capital holders (scholarship managers, guilds...etc).\n\n### So… Can it? Aka. How Crypto Changes this Equation\n\n### Trustlessness\n\nFrom Pillar 2, we understand that RMT markets are opaque and have bad UX for buyers of in-game assets, but the introduction of crypto can allow users to transact trustlessly. This is one of the key pieces in redefining the future of work.\n\nBecause this is a grey market, scams abound and the discomfort of entering in your credit card data without assurance that your gold will be delivered is nerve-racking, the sellers who have the most/best positive ratings dominate purchases. This means that sellers who have the capital to deploy customer service, marketing bots on forums/in-game, set up and host custom websites...etc will end up attracting more customers, which reflexively attracts more customers, regardless of price. This incentivizes the creation of larger pools that expand this initial capital to gain size, then raise prices. Once you have built enough trust and legitimacy such that it makes sense to use your platform over cheaper alternatives, it's very hard for new entrants to unseat existing sellers.\n\n[https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645844334714883](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645844334714883)\n\n[https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645845991477250](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645845991477250)\n\n[https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645847740489729](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645847740489729)\n\nCrypto levels this playing field. Once you know that each vendor is trustworthy (by definition of the blockchain), then it is in the buyers’ best interest to purchase from the pool with the best price, or the most benefits. As for the sellers, any seller is now able to plug into the marketplace without the upfront investment of scaling legitimacy. **And because the marketplace platforms themselves are again easy to create, producer income can scale linearly with production. The margin that accrued to those at scale and to the platform is now distributed to everyone.**\n\n### Rewarding Time and Effort\n\nIf there is demand for in-game assets and gold, and RMT platforms exist where they can be changed for fiat, the production of in-game assets and gold is valuable labor denominated in fiat. But even one step further, crypto allows the rewarding of in-game contributions outside of the simple production of in-game assets.\n\nIn the past you contributed your time and soul to a game, amassing items that are then circulated into the economy. You build guilds, interact with other players and build social credibility within the game. **With the introduction of crypto-gaming, it has become possible to reward and incentivize these players and core contributors in a way that is fair and algorithmic.** As introduced in Pillar 5, gamers can be incentivized by levels, times, or core contributions as voted retroactively by members of the community.\n\nCertainly, Zezima and Woox contributed to the popularity of Runescape as much as many of the mods at Jagex, and Dean Hall did the same for Arma 2 with DayZ.\n\n### Geography\n\nFinally, crypto gaming is global. Most often when we produce goods and services, we are selling them to the purchasing power of our immediate vicinity or the section of the supply chain that is within our immediate vicinity. The farmer, clothes maker, bank teller of a specific region are henceforth bound in their wages by the economic conditions of the region they live in, so that the demand for their goods and services, either by the end-user or the next step in the supply chain, come from local buyers. This means that those who live in countries with economic instability have commensurate low wages.\n\nThis is true even in software. Despite software’s global nature, in practice at a smaller scale, local firms use local technologies. This is why despite being an SWE, some of my Axie scholars tell me they make as much if not more playing Axie than coding.\n\nWith crypto gaming, however, any worker anywhere can tap into a global source of demand. Games have been global from day 1. Because markets built on crypto are also fundamentally global, assets produced in-game that are then sold to those who want to play the game, are matched with the highest price. This purchasing power then leads to higher wages and empowerment of the aforementioned regions via capital inflow from more economically developed regions. This is why Axie scholars can sometimes earn more than their yearly wage playing Axie Infinity, or why they’re able to buy houses, laundry machines from Axie earnings. This is also why Venezuelan gold farmers exist on WoW and OSRS.\n\nCombined with the fact that transparent markets allow sustainable earnings for smaller players and redistribute margin from larger pools and platforms to smaller users, crypto gaming will allow any individual to play a game and sell the byproduct of their gaming to a global market. Furthermore, they will be able to get compensated by the depth of their contributions regardless of their geography.\n\n### Warning: Over Financialization \n\nWhile we illustrated an ambitious vision for how blockchain games can benefit gaming, we also acknowledge the [overwhelming response](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/nzto5t/blockchain_nfts_and_gaming_is_there_a_future_in_it/) from the gaming community that does not want financialization in their games.\n\nAt the end of the day, games are meant to be fun. Though you may derive auxiliary revenue from playing, if the purpose of the game becomes to make money, or if large financial interests come in and speculate on prices of rare items and land thus pricing out players, then gameplay becomes exclusionary to the players themselves. **This is why it’s so important to maintain decentralized player-driven governance over coin-voting schemes in NFT games.**\n\n**Overall, we warn against games seeking to maximally price discriminate through NFT licenses, NFT items...etc, and any cash-grab projects that add no value.** We hope that games can still maintain their end goal of providing a fun time for the user while using NFTs, governance, and contributor rewards to enhance games’ functionality and ability to tell a narrative, thus creating a more immersive and positive gaming experience.\n\n## The Future\n\nStory + Value + Virtual worlds. Games have the opportunity to become the backdrop of what is being called the metaverse - [as defined by Mathew Ball](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/forwardtothemetaverseprimer):\n\n> “A massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds which can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users, and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications, and payments.”\n\nFortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox have demonstrated they have surpassed use cases beyond just gaming and dub sub-games within their platforms as experiences. As the games evolve, so will our involvement within their worlds.\n\n![The Canonical Example - Travis Scott Convert In Fornite](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BmWzazqNn5fZUxy2UzIvZ.jpg?height=1200&width=1800)\n\nWe hope that these experiences will be able to take advantage of the aforementioned pillars of crypto-gaming while avoiding over-finalization to provide more immersive, open, and fair experiences in whatever this may evolve into in the next 20 years.\n\nIn our next article, we will introduce protocols building economic primitives in the metaverse. We are also working on a paper on optimized proof of participation models based on on-chain verifiable participation data in crypto games. So catch us again soon.\n\nIf you've enjoyed this article and want to support us in writing more about crypto gaming, the metaverse, and other related topics please consider purchasing this as an NFT!

Connext常见问题解答\n\n1.  为什么在https\\://www\\.xpollinate.io/ 过一小会儿就提示让我进行签名? 这是Connext的安全机制制定的, 它保证是你在操作钱包跨链转账操作, 而不是黑客.\n\n2.  转账的费用是多少? 目前L2 跨链转账费用固定是 0.05%\n\n3.  目前支持哪些L2层的链? BSC, Xdai, polygon, Fantom, Arbitrum One, Avalanche\n\n4.  目前支持哪些币种的跨链? 现在只支持稳定币 usdc usdt 和 DAI\n\n5.  我可以跨链转账成不同的稳定币吗? 比如 polygon链的usdc转换成BSC链上的DAI? 不可以, 目前只支持原币转换. 比如polygon链的USDC 只能转换成其他链上的USDC.\n\n6.  跨链转账需要多长时间可以到账? 根据网络拥堵的情况不同,时间有一定差异. 大部分交易可以在3分钟内完成.\n\n7.  connext与其他跨链桥有什么区别吗? Connext 使用的是 NXTP(Noncustodial Xchain Transfer Protocol)协议, 所有的转账数据都来自链上, 所以它比其他桥在安全性更安全. 当然对小额高频转账,可能就不是很友好. 8.Connext 有令牌吗？ 否。 Connext 目前没有令牌。任何对 Connext 令牌的引用肯定是骗局。\n\n8.  Connext 是交易所（或其他 dApp）吗？ 不。Connext 是由许多独立的流动性/基础设施提供商（称为路由器）组成的协议，可以实现链之间的通信。开发人员可以在 Connext 之上构建本地跨链应用程序，如 DEX。\n\n9.

As we will see later, we are receiving support from various VCs.\n\n・The content of the protocol is similar to Curve Finance (similar, or Curve centered on BTC?), And it seems that Team members are also aware of Curve.\n\n2 Overview\n・The issue is that BTC, which boasts the largest market capitalization in Crypto, cannot be fully used in the Decentralized field, and various BTC peg tokens can be traded within AMM to solve this issue.\n\n・ Surprisingly, you can trade ETH peg tokens and stablecoins on AMM.\n\n・ Currently, the stocks that can be traded are as follows.\n\nBTC (tBTC WBTC RENBTC, etc.)\nETH (wETH sETH alETH, etc.)\nStablecoin such as USDC and DAI\nTrading with Virtual Swap\n・Virtual Swap is a virtual swap that uses Synthetix's synthetic assets.\n\n・Synthetix currently has a large liquidity pool (so-called infinite liquidity) of over $ 1 billion. Saddle uses Synthetix's infinite liquidity by using synthetic assets such as sUSD as a bridge between pools to swap.\n\n・For example, suppose you want to swap WBTC from USDC on Saddle.\n\n・When using the USDC pool and wBTC pool as AMM, if the assets in each pool are insufficient, slippage will become large and other problems will occur.\n\n・In Saddle, synthetic assets are included in the liquidity pool (as shown in the photo below, for example, the BTC pool contains sBTC), and by functioning the synthetic assets as a Liquid Bridge between the pools, Synthetix You can swap through the large liquidity pool above (infinite liquidity).\n\n・Specifically, the transaction works as follows.\n\nUSDC-> sUSD (rate set by AMM)\nsUSD-> sBTC (rate set by Chainlink Oracle)\nsBTC-> WBTC (rate set by AMM)\n\nFinancing status\n・Saddle has raised $ 4.3M from Coinbase Ventures, Dragonfly Capital, Nascent, Divergence Ventures, Alameda Research, Polychain Capital and more.\n\n3 About benefits (Airdrop)\n・Saddle has not been issued a token yet, but there is a description that it is aiming to form a DAO in the future. Looking at the example of Curve, I think that there is a good chance that this kind of project will eventually issue tokens. Therefore, in the following, I would like to consider how to contribute to the project with a view to obtaining Airdrops.\n\nHow to contribute (1) Liquidity supply\n・For liquidity supply, simply deposit the target asset from the Pool tab.\n\n・ As a trial, try supplying liquidity in the Stablecoin Pool V2 pool.\n\n① Select the target pool from Pool\n\n② Select the target currency. There are DAI, USDC, and USDC here, but any one is fine. Let's deposit 112 USDC.\n\n③ This is the USDC Deposit screen. After this, you will be charged for gas for Confirm and Deposit (at this time, it cost a total of $ 50 ...)\n\n④ Deposit completed successfully\n\n(2) SNX staking\n・As mentioned above, Saddle uses Synthetix's liquidity and virtual swap capabilities. A project using Synthetix indirectly contributes to the project by staking SNX tokens.\n\n・ In many cases, projects using Synthetix have been airdropped by SNX staking. Personally, I think Saddle may also have an airdrop on the SNX staker.\n\n\\[Reference: Airdrop example by SNX staking\\]\n\nThals have tokens airdropped on SNX stakers (those who have stakes even once and get paid). (Click here for the article)\nAelin has decided that 50% of the governance token AELIN will be allocated to SNX stakers (see article here)\nKwenta declares airdrop by SNX staking. See past articles for details.\n(3) Acquisition of NFT\n・ Saddle issues NFTs in various situations.\n\nIssuance of Decentralized passport NFT in collaboration with ARCx\nNFT auction in partnership with CryptoManga\n・Currently, the details of this NFT Utility have not been clarified, but recently there are increasing cases of giving benefits to POAP and NFT holders, so even with Saddle, airdrops and whitelists at the time of sale etc. You may get benefits. The above NFTs can be purchased at Opensea.\n\n4 Conclusion\n・According to the roadmap, Virtual Swap updates and transactions on Optimism are planned, and there are likely to be various movements in 2021-4Q.\n\n・Also, in recent L2 and so-called Defi 2.0 projects, there are many cases where Synthetix's synthetic assets and infinite liquidity are used, and I strongly feel that it is necessary to understand Synthetix itself and watch trends.", "timestamp": 1635947786, "digest": "DBIoH9Cx0lO-zBggL19IgnraFgbV7YhC_rchGSdZP64", "contributor": "0x0f8361eF329B43fA48aC66A7cD8F619C517274f1"}

是一种组织人员的新方式。传统上，公司结构一直是最有效的自由市场方法来积累人才以实现目标。这种劳动通常是通过工资来说服和控制的。DAO 寻求类似的目标——创造价值——但依赖于一个分散的框架，在这个框架中，工人、用户和其他利益相关者拥有实体的真正所有权。\n\n已经出现了各种类型的 DAO，以服务于不同的用例。随着对该领域兴趣的增加，DAO 开始多样化并尝试探索可能的边界。有用于投资的 DAO，用于构建新产品的 DAO，用于社交的 DAO，以及之间和之外的许多迭代。\n\n这些实体管理着有意义的资产。那些对加密领域，尤其是 DAO 持怀疑态度的人，可能想要重新考虑他们的立场。这些组织具有真正的影响力和真正的资本。在顶级 DAO 中管理着数百亿美元，其中一些，例如Compound，本身就拥有近 10 亿美元的资金。\n\n谈到 DAO 基础设施，我们还为时过早。DAO 有许多与公司相同的需求，但鉴于其规模、流动性和技术堆栈，必须经常处理更大的复杂性。这需要出现用于组建、沟通、协作、支付等的工具。DAO 有少数提供者可以在这些类别中进行选择，但总的来说，选择是有限的。我们应该期待未来几年会有许多新进入者进入这个领域。\n\nDAO 具有尚未完全解决的明显漏洞。第一个 DAO 被黑客入侵，一个坏演员试图从以太坊中窃取数百万美元。虽然今天的 DAO 更安全，但它们也存在风险。贡献者经常匿名加入，这意味着声誉资本并不完全在线。此外，如果没有足够的保护，一些 DAO 仍然容易受到利用。\n\nDAO团队的影响力人物\nAaron Wright，Tribute Labs 的创始人\n\nFWB 市长Alex Zhang\n\nDecentology 的联合创始人Chase Chapman\n\nCooper Turley , ∞

Gabriele，Founder of The Generalist创始人\n\n我们并不总是为公司工作\n\n直到 1820 年，只有20%的美国人口为支付工资的组织工作。其余的人耕种、捕鱼、经营自己的生意，或者在这些活动之间分配时间。\n\n在接下来的 130 年里，情况发生了迅速的变化。工业化提供了获得更多财富的机会，同时要求增加劳动力。这推动了具有集中式指挥系统的大型组织下的工人的整合。这些转变意味着到 1950 年，多达 90% 的人口依赖公司获取工资。\n\n那么，公司是一种现代现象，至少在我们通常认为的方式上是这样。今天看起来如此嵌入和难以处理的东西——大多数新企业的默认设置——实际上只是人类解决协调问题的最新尝试。\n\n一个更好的选择可能已经出现。尽管远非完美，但去中心化自治组织 (DAO) 试图在实现大规模人类协作的同时弥补公司的一些缺陷。这种互联网和加密原生结构旨在分散治理和所有权，让贡献者有机会确定项目的方向并从其成功中获利。\n\n虽然仍处于起步阶段，但对该组织框架的兴趣激增表明 DAO 是一个值得认真对待的想法。尤其是在过去的几个月里，新的 DAO 已经崭露头角，吸引了有意义的资本和高素质、有奉献精神的人才。从历史上看，那些关注加密领域这种混乱的人在多年后看起来很有先见之明——即使炒作似乎被夸大了。建筑商和投资者都应该适当考虑这个空间。\n\n除了潜在的财务收益之外，DAO 还可能预示着具有持久影响的社会转变。毕竟，我们受到我们经营所在组织的影响。社会学家查尔斯·佩罗 (Charles Perrow)在他的著作《组织协会》( A Society of Organizations) 中认为，组织解释了我们世界的大部分运作方式。他介绍了这个理论，如下：\n\n\\[U\\]除非您是组织理论家……您的专业将被视为因变量；组织将是塑造政治和经济行为、分层系统、宗教、社会心理过程和一般历史的自变量。\n\n作为一个新的自变量，DAO 将如何影响这些依赖项中的每一个？这种结构将对宗教、历史和政治产生什么影响？\n\n佩罗说：“我的主张是，组织是理解我们社会的关键，因为组织吸收了社会的大部分内容。”\n\n如果这个格言成立，那么 DAO 将吸收生活的哪些部分？如果公司侵入了在物理领域建立的关系和联系，那么随着时间的推移，DAO 可能会同化我们的数字生物。简而言之，它们可能会吸收互联网，成为我们新的 web3 社会的组成部分。\n\n我们将在今天的文章中探讨这个想法，同时解开 DAO 的当前状态。特别是，我们期待着回答下列问题（和你说一句话“道”那么，这么多的）：\n\n定义。解释什么是 DAO 以及我们如何看待它们。\n\n历史。新组织结构的起源。\n\n类别。存在的各种类型的 DAO。\n\n文化。支撑空间的价值观和理念。\n\n景观。主要参与者及其使用的工具。\n\n启动一个 DAO。探索去中心化的好处以及所需的策略。法律问题。怀俄明州有希望的发展和开放的问题。\n\n反对 DAO。结构的脆弱性及其未经证实的潜力。\n\n边境。探索未来可能发生的事情。\n\n在这篇文章的结尾，我们希望您能够对正在发生的事情以及它为什么重要有一个深刻的了解。尽管今天看起来不太可能，但在几十年后，很大一部分人口不是为中心化实体工作，而是为通过加密启用的去中心化实体工作，这并非不可能。\n\n历史和传说\n想发明自己的金融衍生品吗？使用以太坊，你可以。想制作自己的货币吗？将其设置为以太坊合约。想要建立一个完整的守护进程或天网？你可能需要有几千份相互关联的合同，并且一定要慷慨地养活它们，才能做到这一点，但没有什么能阻止你。\n\n这些词出现在 Vitalik Buterin 的 2013 年以太坊白皮书中——这是有史以来第一个对 DAO 的描述的来源。上面 Buterin 的解释不仅说明了他的区块链的模块化和力量，还暗示了它的智力影响。\n\n事实上，在以太坊出现之前的几年，更不用说 DAO，还有“守护进程”。2006 年，科幻作家丹尼尔·苏亚雷斯 (Daniel Suarez) 出版了一本同名的书，可以将其视为 DAO 的一种原始文本。\n\n在Daemon 中，苏亚雷斯描绘了一幅大规模计算机程序的图景，该程序编排了一个地下合作社会。虽然 Daemon 参与了许多我们不希望任何 web3 组织从中汲取灵感的不健康行为（想想自动驾驶摩托车刺客！），但它的基本操作与今天的 DAO 非常相似：支付赏金，在社区中共享信息，并管理叙事货币。\n\n尽管功能相似，Daemon并没有创造“DAO”这个名字。Buterin 在以太坊白皮书发布之前曾写过关于 “去中心化自治组织” 的文章，但他在开创性工作中包含了一个整洁的定义：\n\n\\[DAO 是\\] 一个虚拟实体，它拥有一组特定的成员或股东，其中可能有 67% 的多数，有权使用实体的资金并修改其代码。\n\n与守护进程一样，以太坊 DAO 依赖于自我修改代码。然而，与苏亚雷斯的创建不同，Buterin 将 DAO 设想为从根本上透明，具有明确的治理流程和建立共识的路径。\n\n白皮书对两种类型的 DAO 的描述进一步说明了这一概念：“去中心化自治公司”（DAC1）和“去中心化自治社区”（DAC2）。（这些首字母缩略词是我们试图轻松区分它们的尝试，而不是规范。）\n\nButerin 将前者设想为具有可交易股份和股息的谋利实体，而后者则更像是一个民主实体，社区成员可以在其中对某些问题进行投票，例如增加或删除成员。实际上，DAC1 以“1 股 = 1 票”的模式运行，而 DAC2 则以“1 名成员 = 1 票”的方式进行管理。不用说，Daemon 的读者会记得这本书的近乎无所不知的程序没有如此清晰的结构。\n\n现在，虽然 Buterin 在本节开头的引用可以被视为一种邀请，但它也是——至少在某种程度上——是一种挑衅。\n\n想要建立一个完整的守护进程或天网？......没有什么能阻止你......\n\n有人花了将近三年的时间来接受这个挑战。2016 年 4 月，DAO 诞生了。该项目以最好的意图开始，希望成为以太坊社区事实上的风险基金，以去中心化的方式进行管理。社区成员共同投资 The DAO，并对潜在投资进行投票。\n\n事实证明，这对许多人来说是一个诱人的提议。DAO 从 11,000 多个 LP 中迅速积累了 1270 万个 ETH，相当于当时的 1.5 亿美元。即使在传统的风险投资公司中，这种规模的公司也很有意义。就上下文而言，在 The DAO 成立的同一年，传奇基金 Union Square Ventures 宣布关闭一个 1.66 亿美元的新基金，与以太坊原生工具相比并没有太多。\n\n对于那些知道接下来会发生什么的人来说，很难不花一点时间想象这个实体可能会取得多么神奇的成功。如果 DAO 只是坚持其 ETH，提供零 alpha，那么它今天管理的资产将相当于 520亿美元。如果 DAO 甚至选出了几个赢家——它肯定会拥有世界上最广泛的采购结构——总和可能会高得多。结果将是去中心化金融领域的老虎全球规模的参与者。\n\n当然，事情并没有那样进行。\n\n同年 6 月，The DAO 遭到黑客攻击。从实体中提取了整整 360 万个 ETH 并转移到一个持有账户。为了让 ETH 的所有者有机会收回他们的资金，以太坊经历了一次硬分叉。没有损失任何资金，但这次黑客攻击导致了以太坊社区内部的分裂，并说明了尚未完全成熟的 DAO 结构的危险。\n\n随之而来的是一个 DAO 冬天，在更广泛的加密货币冷却之前并经历了这个冬天。尽管如此，即使在这个较慢的时期，专门的建筑商仍在该领域进行建设。由贡献者 Jorge Izquierdo 共同创立的 Aragon 于 2016 年开始为 DAO 开发工具。MakerDAO 成立于 2015 年，其声望继续增长，吸引了新的人才在该领域工作。\n\n在过去的 12 个月中，这些先行者已被证明至关重要。对 DAO 重新燃起的热情已经转化为切实的复兴，部分原因是因为新来者能够依赖 Aragon 和 Maker 等组织创建的基础设施和架构。\n\n在我们谈论游戏状态之前，我们会更深入地思考“DAO”的定义。\n\n什么是 DAO？\n希望上面的部分让我们对手头的主题有所了解。但是，还是值得花点时间思考一下这个最直接的问题：什么是DAO？\n\n即使在了解了 DAO 知识之后，回答这个问题也是一个看似棘手的问题。或者至少，回答好。\n\n首先，我们可以回到首字母缩略词的来源词：“去中心化自治组织”。\n\n这意味着什么？\n\n好吧，如果名副其实，DAO 应该没有中央权威（去中心化），独立于政府或私营部门参与者（自治）运作，并且是组织。\n\n够简单了吧？\n\n不完全的。当您意识到我们今天称为“DAO”的实体很少真正符合这个定义时，事情就会变得相当模糊。真正的去中心化很少见，尤其是一开始，因为大多数项目需要一定程度的中心化才能启动和运行。自主权也是如此。\n\n至关重要的是，这些特征不应该被视为二元的。回答 DAO 是否去中心化并不是一个“是”或“否”的问题，而是一个程度的问题。去中心化和自治是滑动的尺度，“DAO”在这个范围内以不同的方式定位自己。\n\n由于字面上的阅读并没有让我们走得很远，我们需要其他方式来思考 DAO。这里的棘手部分是精心设计的行为提出了自己的问题。事实上，每个定义 DAO 的人都可能给你一个微妙或有意义的不同回应。例如，一个有趣的对话者可能会合理地将 DAO 归类为共享银行账户的群聊，第二个可能将其归类为具有分布式所有权的社区，而（梦幻般的）三分之一可能会简单地将其称为“氛围”。\n\n一切都会好起来的，以他们自己的方式。DAO是群聊和社区，他们中的许多人通过他们的文化或氛围将自己分开。但是，尽管内容丰富，但这些描绘的某些东西却使这个想法显得很短。\n\nDAO 不仅仅是一个带有原生代币的 Discord 通道。相反，它们是面向共同目的的实体：创造价值。这是我们声明的表达方式的共同点。\n\n当然，价值创造的定义方式各不相同。一些专注于构建有形的数字产品，而另一些则着眼于积累和复合社会资本。尽管如此，这个基本目的仍然存在。\n\n这是对一个 DAO 最基本的描述，并不能令人满意。难道我们不能说几乎所有组织都致力于创造价值吗？公司不追求同样的目的吗？国家和宗教呢？\n\n“价值”过于主观，无法给我们足够的清晰度。为了对 DAO 有更高的保真度理解，我们需要超越命名法，并查看将这种实体形式与其他实体区分开来的特征。\n\n特征\n\n要了解 DAO 与其他组织有何不同，我们只需要看看它们如何处理所有权和组织。\n\n所有权\n\nDAO 不是将所有权集中到创始人和投资者手中，而是将所有权分配给生态系统中的各种利益相关者，包括贡献者、用户、战略合作伙伴、供应商等。\n\n从本质上讲，DAO 由在其中创造价值的人拥有。这是一个激进的观念，而且具有真正的后果；通过超越谁应该“拥有”一个组织的传统概念，DAO 赋予广泛的生态系统以代表其采取行动和创造价值的能力。\n\n组织\n\n如前所述，DAO 寻求“自治”。最初，这个术语指的是 DAO 希望在组织层面独立行动——不受国家或私营部门参与者的干扰。\n\n虽然某些 DAO 确实如此，但可以说，更重要的自治形式发生在个人层面。选民可以加入 DAO 并选择以他们认为最引人注目的方式做出贡献。可能有指导方针，但总的来说，利益相关者选择自己的劳动力并自我组织。\n\n同样，这很重要。传统上，个人贡献者和监督实体之间的关系是一种从属关系——工人按照公司的要求行事。这里不是这种情况。DAO“工人”在他们认为可以增加价值并希望这样做的时间和地点加入。\n\n通过采用这种方法，DAO 为紧急行为创造了条件。复杂系统的形成方式是任何个人或团体都无法自上而下协调的。\n\n构架\n仔细研究所有权和组织等特征可以让我们对 DAO 有更清晰的了解，但仍然很难将它们完全置于上下文中。\n\n为了更好地理解 DAO 如何在战术上运作，我们可以将它们与预先存在的组织结构进行比较。尽管从根本上是不同的，但通过尝试将 DAO 视为公司、合作社和网络，我们可以学到很多东西。\n\nDAO 作为公司\n\n尽管在所有权和组织方面存在差异，但公司仍然是理解 DAO 的有用框架。\n\n事实上，较大的 DAO 通常以类似于公司的方式运作，具有明确的“部门”，例如产品、营销、工程和社区。这些部门通常有一个团队负责人来指导和支持其他成员，与经理没有什么不同。\n\n一般来说，DAO 中的领导层往往是流动的和无等级的，类似于“青色组织”。正如管理理论家 Frederic Laloux 所定义的那样，Teal 组织是自治的且自然发展的。他们还鼓励员工将自己的全部精力投入到组织中。\n\nDAO 作为合作社\n\n当然，鉴于 DAO 与公司无关紧要的方面有所不同，特别是在所有权方面，上述框架仅到此为止。\n\n出于这个原因，合作社可能是一个更恰当的比较。合作社由为其做出贡献的工人拥有和控制。这类似于 DAO，在 DAO 中，利益相关者会收到授予治理权和分配所有权的代币。它距离您附近的杂货店没有一百万英里，被带入数字领域。\n\n作为网络的 DAO\n\n尽管 coop 框架有助于对所有权进行建模，但 DAO 不仅将所有权分配给贡献者——合理地等同于员工。相反，他们将所有权分配给一系列不同的利益相关者。这可能包括用户（如果 DAO 正在构建产品）、战略合作伙伴、供应商、与任务一致的社区成员等。\n\n结果与纯粹的合作社截然不同：网络。成员以自由形式相互交流，角色频繁而流畅地变化。\n\n在许多方面，这是考虑 DAO 的最有用的框架。当然，虽然网络并不新鲜——当协调复杂性很大时，私营和公共部门的组织都依赖它们——它特别适合 web3 时代。随着 DAO 规模和复杂性的增长，网络模型允许以可扩展的方式进行协调和对齐。\n\n这些框架在两年后是否有意义？五个呢？即使在今天，也可能有十几种或更多的方式来构思这个概念。\n\n（可以通过推特查看13种DAO概念）\n\n我们认为共享价值创造的基本目标可能会保持不变，但鉴于该领域的创新步伐，未来几年我们对 DAO 的看法可能会大不相同。考虑到这一点，是时候深入研究 DAO 的不同类别了。\n\nDAO 的类型\n\n很快，可能会有太多的 DAO 进行分类而没有多大意义。毕竟，如果您问某人“存在哪些类型的有限责任公司？” 他们可能会觉得回答这个问题很棘手。我们可能会在不久的将来达到 DAO 具有同等多样性的地步。\n\n不过，就目前而言，我们仍然可以区分 DAO 的类型。在一个高的水平，大部分的DAO要么是技术型或面向社会。\n\n以技术为导向的 DAO 倾向于专注于在加密领域进行构建。他们还倾向于在链上执行更多操作。\n\n面向社会的 DAO 的存在主要是为了将一群人聚集在一起，并为他们寻找新的互动和召集方式。治理更有可能是链下的，或者根本不存在。\n\n现在，这些细分市场之间没有强硬的界限。正如 DAO 存在于去中心化和自治的范围内一样，它们通常也在这里这样做。\n\n例如，MakerDAO 从根本上是面向技术的。但它具有极其强大的社会成分，具有很高的社区参与度和互动性。\n\n与此同时，有利益的朋友本质上是社交的。它充当艺术家、创始人和思想家的“文化会员”和数字聚集点。然而，它受益于强大的产品团队，该团队构建了有意义的工具，如事件令牌门控（“ Gatekeeper ”）、仪表板（“ Pulse ”）和编辑网站（“ WIP ”）。\n\n在这个范围内，有许多子类别值得分解。特别是，我们将重点关注：协议 DAO、社交 DAO、投资 DAO、资助 DAO、服务 DAO、媒体 DAO、创作者 DAO 和收集者 DAO。（我们告诉过你，在这篇文章中我们不得不说很多 DAO。）\n\n请注意，如果您想了解更多信息，这篇文章的撰稿人 Cooper Turley 对这些类型有很好的深入研究。\n\n协议 DAO\n顾名思义，协议 DAO 是用于帮助构建协议的协作实体。一个例子是上面讨论的MakerDAO 之类的东西。Maker 协议不是完全由集中式团队构建和管理，而是由相关 DAO 编排。\n\n事实上，在其多年的运营中，Maker 构建了一个由 15 个核心单元组成的复杂结构。每个单元都有任务和预算，由一个或多个协调人管理，协调和支付贡献者以实现 MakerDAO 内的长期目标。此外，每个部门都是一个独立的结构，由其自己的条款管辖，但仍然对 Maker 持有者做出回应。\n\nSushi、Uniswap、Compound、DANK也可以被视为协议 DAO，尽管每个都根据自己的结构运行。\n\n社交 DAO\n\nFriends with Benefits (FWB) 是一个经典的社交 DAO，尽管具有我们提到的工程技术。这里的目标是创建一个强大的社区。在这方面，最终结果与其他在线聚会并没有什么不同，尤其是那些有围墙花园的聚会。（一些 DAO 还专注于连接线上到线下，举办 IRL 聚会。）正如我们所讨论的，不同之处在于自治和所有权的概念。\n\n由撰稿人 Jess Sloss 创立的Seed Club是该领域的另一位参与者——尽管职责范围很广。CabinDAO和Bright Moments是另外两个例子。\n\n投资 DAO\n如果社交 DAO 主要是关于社区，那么投资 DAO 主要是关于回报。类似于 The DAO——第一个命运多舛的投资实体——这些项目的目标是聚集资本和投资者进行部署。与传统的风险投资公司不同，决策实际上是民主的，LP 对相关机会进行投票。\n\n通常，不同的投资 DAO 会有不同的侧重点。例如，一个人可能专门购买 ENS 名称，另一个人可能专注于区块链游戏，而第三个可能会资助加密初创公司。\n\n由贡献者亚伦赖特创立的 LAO是该领域的领导者。该母公司已经分拆出一些额外的车辆，包括火烈鸟和海王星。MetaCartel是另一个值得注意的投资 DAO。\n\n授予 DAO\n在上面提到的那篇文章中，Turley 指出，许多早期的 DAO 都是面向赞助的，作为 Grant DAO 运作。通常，这些存在于预先存在的项目之外，作为社区激励的一种形式。通过拨款，这些 DAO 寻求推进更广泛的生态系统，支持有前途的项目，并为新的 web3 贡献者开辟道路。\n\n例如，Uniswap 运营Uniswap Grants，Compound和Audius 也在做同样的事情。尽管在功能上与父实体不同，但它们仍然通过一种目的感联系在一起，并且通常是一个共同的社区。\n\n服务 DAO\n服务 DAO 在这个领域占据了一个独特的位置。具体而言，这些实体充当人才聚合器，将可用于某些项目的人力资本聚集在一起。\n\n例如，RaidGuild称自己为“Web3 生态系统的首要设计和开发机构”。不过，与传统机构不同的是，Raid 没有正式员工或公司结构：它是一个 DAO。\n\nService DAO 与 1Up World、Tellor 和 Stake On Me 等客户合作。 PartyDAO、DAOhaus、Yam DAO和其他许多都属于这一类别。\n\n媒体 DAO\nForefront、Bankless和DarkStar是 Media DAO。这些实体通常协作制作公共内容。来自该内容的奖励在整个团队中共享，而治理也是一项公共事务。利益相关者可以帮助决定要涵盖的主题以及管理资源。\n\n创建者 DAO\n如果 Media DAO 经常关注出版物，那么 Creator DAO 则以个人为中心。就像一些粉丝俱乐部为影响者最热情的支持者提供消费和互动的机会一样，DAO 也有能力这样做。除了纯粹的粉丝之外，利益相关者还可以积极贡献或为支持他们最热衷的创作者的组织工作。\n\n目前这是一种不太常见的结构，但可能会变得更受欢迎。我们已经看到许多创作者通过Roll 等产品采用“社交代币” ，这为真正的 Creator DAO 奠定了基础。先行者包括Leaving Records和Personal Corner。\n\n收藏品 DAO\n尽管与 Investor DAO 共享一些利润动机，但 Collector DAO 最终的定位略有不同。这些实体将贡献者围绕某些资产或收藏品联合起来。NFT 是一种常见的选择。\n\n虽然 NFT 的积累也可能产生极其有利的财务回报，但这些社区通常无意出售他们的物品，至少在中短期内是这样。对 NFT 和其他收藏品的收购也有一个根本不同的基调——参与与粉丝和亲和力一样多，甚至更多，因为它与阿尔法有关。\n\n这些团体也经常担任某些项目的策展人的角色，增加了一种机构寿命和支持。 例如，SquiggleDAO 的存在是为了支持和收集生成艺术，而MeebitsDAO收集 Meebits NFT。PleasrDAO充当跨项目的“艺术收藏帝国”。NounsDAO是 Noun NFT 持有者的聚集点，他们在未来的 Noun 销售中获得份额。\n\n当然，DAO 可以存在于这些类别之外或之间。例如，Krause House是一个 DAO，它既是一种投资工具，也是一种社会倡议：它的组装目标是共同购买一支 NBA 球队。\n\n展望未来，值得重申的是，虽然上述类别具有指导意义，但我们才刚刚开始。许多未来的伟大 DAO 将在这些界限之外进行绘制。\n\n哲学与文化\nDAO 代表了大规模人类协调的新框架，而人类协调的核心——无论是否去中心化——是组织文化。\n\n与早期初创公司的公司文化或未被发现的音乐场景中的社区文化没有什么不同，文化可以定义为个体群体之间出现的行为、模式和价值观。在他们的开创性文章“ Squad Wealth ”中，研究组织其他互联网指出，文化可以由任何东西组成，从“模因、热门话题、内部语言、𝓪𝓮𝓼𝓽𝓱𝓮𝓽𝓲𝓬𝓼，到只能被制定为一个群体的人工制品。”\n\n虽然每个 DAO 都找到了自己的方式来产生具有视觉、语言和行为规范的文化，但在整个 DAO 环境中，两个特征似乎特别普遍：成员行为的倾向，以及对彻底透明的期望。\n\n像业主一样行事\n当谈到 DAO 的文化时，所有权具有巨大的影响力。 它不仅激励个人参与，而且从根本上改变了贡献者对他们的努力和劳动的看法。所有的工作都建立在追求更大的目标之上，其中的好处是共享的。所有权充满了创造、成功和\\~共鸣\\~的感觉。与传统工人相比，老板自然会在经济和心理上更有动力支持同龄人，提升他人的工作，将自我放在门外，并尽其所能。\n\n投资公司 Variant 的联合创始人杰西·瓦尔登 (Jesse Walden) 在这个问题上特别有先见之明。在这篇名为“所有权经济”的文章中，瓦尔登指出：\n\n随着个人在价值创造中的作用变得越来越普遍，下一个演进步骤是朝着不仅由个人用户构建、运营和资助——而且也由用户拥有的软件发展。\n\n从某种意义上说，DAO 正是这种“软件”。他们提升了个人，让用户有机会贡献和拥有。那是强大的。\n\n彻底透明\n透明度在任何组织文化中都起着至关重要的作用，因为它可以在所有参与者之间建立信任。由于区块链上任何 DAO 的 ETH 地址的公开和不可变活动，DAO 以前所未有的水平实现了这一点。这创建了一种隐式和显式的制衡机制，允许利益相关者社区随时了解 DAO 如何行使其资本，同时确保领导团队根据社区做出决策。\n\n这种彻底的透明度会激励合作而不是竞争，并且由于个人对组织环境的深刻理解，因此他们能够对自己的工作拥有自主权。\n\n最终，DAO 的文化由个人群体之间形成的一对一关系定义，这些关系可以提炼为一组可重复的行为和模式。\n\n通过新形式的分散所有权和透明度，DAO 有可能创建新的组织结构，使用户不再是平台上的被动参与者，而是积极的、受到适当激励的网络所有者——以信任和协调为中心。这种权力和文化的分配会带来更多的敏捷性、弹性和反脆弱性，这有助于创造一个世界，在这个世界中，互联网上的大量人群甚至可以与最强大的中心化公司抗衡。\n\n风景\nDAO 已成为整个 web3 世界的核心组织原语。与此同时，一个新兴的生态系统已经出现，以支持这些组织的核心功能。\n\n下面，我们将重点介绍 DAO 领域中具有影响力的利益相关者。我们应该注意，这绝不是一份详尽的清单——地图不是领土。Web3 发展迅速，每天都在变化，新进入者不断改变空间的面貌。\n\n不过，我们将概述以下职能领域的参与者：\n\n编队\n\n沟通\n\n社区\n\n治理\n\n赔偿\n\n国库\n\n我们还会提到其他著名的组织和意见领袖。\n\n让我们让 DAOwn 开始营业。\n\n编队\n为了参与一个 DAO，首先必须有一个 DAO。 目前有几个项目在争夺霸权，包括 Aragon、Syndicate、Orca、Tribute 和 Colony。这些并不总是直接竞争，因为每个解决方案都提供独特的价值主张和功能集。\n\n这些项目有什么作用？一种简单的方法是将它们视为Stripe Atlas的加密原生版本——它们允许 DAO 起步。这包括会员管理、财务工具和治理基础设施等。\n\n在未来几年，我们应该会看到更多的产品进入市场以支持 DAO 的形成。正如白标解决方案用于处理内容管理等任务一样，我们很快就会达到新的 DAO 构建者有多种选择的地步。\n\nAragon（阿拉贡）\n\nAragon成立于 2016 年，提供一套应用程序来大规模创建、管理和治理 DAO。这包括 Aragon Court、Aragon Govern、Aragon Voice 和 Aragon Client。作为最早致力于 DAO 基础设施的团队之一，Aragon 协会已成为 DAO 的重要服务提供商，并声称拥有 LidoDAO 等知名项目的用户。\n\nSyndicate\n\n贡献者 Will Papper 是Syndicate 的联合创始人，Syndicate是一个专注于投资 DAO 的去中心化投资协议和社交网络。它的使命是通过允许个人和社区比传统基金更快、更便宜地推出投资工具，从而使投资世界民主化。Syndicate 的解决方案包括法律支持和社交网络协议，允许投资社区召集、交流和部署资本。\n\nOrca（基于Solana的DEX）\n\nDAO 通常发现难以大规模维持高参与率。Orca 协议对此有一个聪明的解决方案，同时也减少了资金和资源部署的瓶颈。\n\n具体来说，Orca 利用“ Pod 模型”，其中单个单一的金库被较小的“Pod”取代，每个“Pod”都有自己的子会员和钱包。本质上，每个 pod 都充当更大 DAO 结构中的迷你 DAO。\n\n这是一个很大的解锁，通过为 pod 创建基础设施来根据需要附加和分离，为 DAO 带来可组合性，有点像 DAO-lego。它还使小组更小，使协调和参与更容易。\n\nOrca 协议\n\nTribute\n\n作为 MolochDAO 生态系统的一部分，Tribute提供了一个开源解决方案框架，DAO 可以利用这些框架来更好地扩展。它的技术堆栈包括取消提案、创建无投票权股份、踢出成员、使用 NFT 成为会员、白名单代币等的解决方案。Tribute 基本上是模块化的，允许 DAO 挑选他们需要的解决方案。\n\nColony\n\n受蚁群的启发，Colony提供了一系列以太坊智能合约，无需任何编码即可启动 DAO。Colony 简化了治理、权限、补偿等。\n\nColony 本身由 Metacolony 维护——一个尚未公开的 DAO。Metacolony 将不断开发和维护工具，供那些利用 Colony 基础设施的人使用。\n\n沟通\n一旦 DAO 成立，它需要促进其成员之间的沟通。当然，健康的讨论是信息共享的关键，它开启了良好的投票实践、资金管理和更广泛的协调。没有 DAO 想成为安静的地方。\n\n已经出现了许多促进对话的工具，其中包括 Discord、Telegram 和 Twitter。\n\n（ DAO常用的社交沟通应用 ）\n\nDiscord\n\n可以说，DAO 的主要沟通和协调方式是 Discord。对于那些尚未进入令人眼花缭乱的 web3 服务器快速火力世界的人来说，Discord 是一个免费的语音、视频和文本聊天平台，在生态系统中迅速普及。\n\n它的特性使其对 DAO 尤其有吸引力。一方面，启动 Discord 相对简单，而且由于其频道和子频道架构，组织沟通变得简单而灵活。（即使它并不能完全平息疯狂。）\n\n至关重要的是，由于 Discord 已成为 web3 中的默认设置，因此出现了许多有用的机器人和插件来支持它。其中最主要的是“令牌门控”功能。如前所述，一些 DAO 限制对那些持有一定数量原生代币的访问。例如，如果我们要启动 RandomDAO，我们可能会坚持要求任何想要加入 Discord 的人都需要持有 420 个 $RANDOM 代币。\n\nCollab.Land 之类的工具使 DAO 可以轻松确保仅向满足令牌要求的人授予对私人聊天的访问权限。其他广泛使用的机器人包括 MEE6 和 Statbot。\n\n此外，值得注意的是，Discord 与现有站点集成良好；随着越来越多的社区过渡到 DAO，预计这将成为一个越来越重要的功能。\n\n电报\n\nDiscord 最常见的替代品是 Telegram。尽管在加密人群中很受欢迎，但聊天应用程序在 DAO 中的采用率与 Discord 不同。这在很大程度上是因为 Telegram 没有提供相同级别的粒度，特别是在机器人和子渠道方面。\n\n它比较简单，也许是因为，然而，电报是经常对于那些刚刚起步，他们毕业不和谐之前的DAO的温床。\n\n推特\n\n“Twitter 怎么还免费？” 这是该平台最狂热的用户之间的一个笑话，这是有充分理由的。在许多方面，Twitter 已成为某种公共产品，尤其是在加密世界中。在特定日期流经该平台的信息和洞察量是惊人的，其作为行业事实上的社交图谱的至高无上地位巩固了其重要性。（当然，其他人会来争夺那个宝座。）\n\n虽然 Twitter 没有解决 DAO 对私密、高容量聊天的需求，但它仍然是生态系统中的一个重要通信工具——特别是用于发现新项目——如果我们至少不承认这一点，我们就会失职。\n\n协调\n无论是当地社区还是跨国公司，任何集体面临的最大挑战之一是协调，尤其是在规模上。从历史上看，我们使用层次结构来管理这个问题，但是在扁平的、分散的结构中什么是最好的解决方案？\n\nDAO 依靠许多不同的工具来管理他们的社区和优化协调，包括 Coordinape、Collab.Land、SourceCred 和 DAOhaus。\n\n坐标\n\n通过DEFI蓝筹股协议，如向往和寿司使用，Coordinape帮助的DAO协调和资源分配给贡献者。\n\n例如，Coordinape 的“ Circle ”产品允许 DAO 贡献者“赠送”有限数量的 GIVE 代币给他们认为正在为组织带来价值的人。虽然这样做的好处是有趣和奖励参与，但它也创建了一个事实上的“薪酬地图”，说明谁在推动项目向前发展。此外，补偿过程在功能上是分散的，因为任何人都可以选择奖励任何人。\n\n这种机制的批评者认为，点对点补偿会导致人气竞赛，其中最响亮、最外向的成员获得超额分配。\n\nCollab.Land\n\nCollab.Land为 Discord 和 Telegram 提供了一个令牌门控机器人。它在为任一平台上的 DAO 成员分配角色时也很有用。由于其相对易用性，Collab.Land 已成为业界常用的工具，随着 DAO 数量的增加，其使用率应该会上升。\n\nGuild虽然尚未完全启动，但它是具有类似功能集的替代方案。\n\nsourcecred\n\nDAO 使用SourceCred来衡量和奖励个人对项目的贡献。那些通过努力为 DAO 带来价值的人会根据组织设定的参数获得“信誉”。Cred 是一种简单量化贡献者声誉和工作的强大方法。\n\nDAO 还可以发行带有信用的“ Grain ”，它可以用作工资等价物。SourceCred 区分令牌，注意：\n\n如果 cred 回答“谁提供了价值？”这个问题，Grain 会回答“我们应该如何奖励人们提供的价值？”\n\nDAOhaus\n\nDAOhaus是一个“无代码平台”，用于基于 MolochDAO 构建的框架启动和运行 DAO。该平台允许用户通过一个中央枢纽进行协调，在那里他们可以检查活动、治理建议和财务状况。会员资格也可以从这里管理。\n\n由于该平台基于 MolochDAO 的结构，DAOhaus 用户可以访问该父组织提供的所有工具，并具有用户友好的包装器的好处。\n\n赔偿\n让我们换个角度谈谈DAO如何补偿贡献者。正如我们所提到的，一些提供支付功能作为更大的 DAO 套件的一部分，但也存在专门的产品。Superfluid和Sablier尤其引人注目。\n\n将这些工具视为“DAO 的工资单”的一种方式。他们帮助 DAO 在区块链上以最少的 gas 费用定期处理付款。\n\n对于那些刚接触加密货币的人来说，该领域的许多术语可能听起来令人困惑。关于这些项目需要注意的重要一点是，它们使 DAO 可以轻松地向区块链上的贡献者付款。\n\nSuperfluid\n\nSuperfluid是一种允许可编程现金流的协议。使用其独特的 ERC-777 标准，您可以定义“价值流”，以便补偿自动不断地流向 DAO 的贡献者。这有点像设置您公司的工资单，这样，您的员工就可以根据他们工作的每一秒获得实时报酬，而不是每月获得两次报酬。所有这些都无需您进一步干预。\n\nSuperfluid\n\n与 Superfluid 一样，Sablier是一个金融流媒体平台。Sablier 创建于 2019 年，支持任何 ERC-20 代币，并且不收取使用合约的费用。\n\nSablier 的一个显着特点是它真正具有自主性。创建该项目的团队销毁了控制第 1 层合约的管理密钥。这意味着 Sablier 的制造商不再有能力阻止新流的创建。用创始人保罗·拉兹万·伯格 (Paul Razvan Berg) 的话来说，它是“100% 去中心化的公共产品”。\n\n（可以通过推特查看细节）\n\n治理\n大规模解决治理和协调决策是 DAO 当今面临的最困难的问题之一。\n\n为什么这么难？\n\nweb3 的一大亮点是其抗审查性和“无需许可的可访问性”。换句话说，任何人在任何地方都可以在不受第三方干扰的情况下相互交易或参与去中心化的协议和应用程序。例如，没有政府能够阻止你加入 DAO。（至少，理论上是这样。）\n\n这种无需许可的访问有时可能是一把双刃剑，尤其是随着 DAO 的增长和扩展。如果成员没有硬性上限，DAO 通常会随着时间的推移变得更大和更加多样化。最终，流行的 DAO 可能拥有数以万计的成员，每个人都会带来不同的技能、经验、价值观、观点和背景。\n\n需要明确的是，这是一个很好的问题。web3 使个人能够从劳动者转变为所有者是其最基本、最引人注目的属性之一。但随着社区变得越来越去中心化，对稳健治理的需求也随之增加——否则，你最终可能会得到一个支离破碎的组织，其中每个参与者都只是在风中尖叫。\n\n几个团队正在疯狂地解决这个问题，构建有助于组织和激励成员的工具。Snapshot 和 Discourse 是两个在空间中广泛使用的看似强大的产品。\n\n快照\n\nSnapshot是一个链下、无气体投票平台，主要由发行 ERC-20 和 ERC-721 治理代币的 DAO 使用。以太坊上昂贵的 gas 费用排除了除最大代币持有者之外的所有人的链上治理。\n\nSnapshot 通过提供一种易于使用且成本低廉的治理参与方法而大受欢迎。本质上，DAO 贡献者可以前往他们组织的快照页面，查看要投票的主题并进行权衡。例如，以下是 Sushi 社区最近投票的提案。\n\n寿司快照页面\n\n举几个值得注意的例子，比如 MakerDAO，大多数代币 DAO 现在将 Snapshot 投票集成到他们的治理过程中。需要注意的是，Gnosis 生产的产品“ SafeSnap ”（下文讨论）允许链上执行链下投票。它通过利用 Snapshot 和 Gnosis Safe 的组合功能来实现这一点。\n\n这是什么意思？\n\n基本上，DAO 参与者仍然可以在链外投票——节省燃料费——随后的结果，并在以后无缝地在链上制定，没有干扰的可能性。\n\n话语权\n\n话语论坛就像 DAO 的“参议院”，代表了对提案进行正式讨论和反馈的场所。围绕治理提案的讨论和辩论可能会在 Discord、Telegram 甚至 Twitter 等后台渠道中进行，但通常提交的内容最终会在 Discourse 上进行，以便进行更有针对性的长篇幅讨论。由于其功能更加正式，Discourse 论坛还充当与 DAO 相关的讨论和提案的档案。\n\nAave 投票页面\n国库\n许多社区 DAO 要求成员投入前期资金才能参与。然后，这笔资金将汇集到 DAO 的“金库”中。与传统公司一样，DAO 希望有效地管理他们的资产，并希望增加他们的持股。为此，许多人将他们的资金投资于整个数字生态系统的资产，包括 NFT、社交代币、加密项目等。实际上，它们充当分散的投资基金。\n\n为了避免您认为此类实验在规模上微不足道，值得注意的是，今天DAO 共同管理着数百亿美元，这些是具有复杂需求且有意义的组织。\n\n开放组织\n大多数 DAO 都有雄心勃勃的计划，但精明的管理可能很困难。首先，加密行业非常不稳定。随着资产价格的上涨和下跌，DAO 的资产在某一天可能会波动 20% 或更多。为了防止这些波动，DAO 必须多样化。\n\nLlama、Parcel 和 Gnosis 旨在为财务经理提供处理此类动荡所需的工具和见解。\n\nLlama\n\nLlama是一个 DAO，专注于协助其他 DAO（元宇宙）进行资金管理。LlamaDAO 已经通过 Gitcoin 赠款协调了一些大客户。它为 Aave、PoolTogether、Uniswap、Gitcoin 和 FWB 等协议创建了仪表板、报告、资金管理指南、协调的销售和财务报表。\n\nParcel\n\nParcel是 DeFi 中一些最大的 DAO 使用的财务套件，包括 Aave Grants、Compound Grants 和 Synthetix。目前处于封闭测试阶段，Parcel 为 8 个 DAO 提供服务，并已被用于为各种程序批量支付 300 万美元。随着 DAO 的扩展，他们将需要 Parcel 提供的解决方案来管理资金流，以有效地授予接受者、支付贡献者和部署资金。\n\nGnosis Safe\n\nGnosis Safe是 GnosisDAO 开发的一项服务，可为 DAO 多重签名钱包提供更好的用户体验。\n\n什么是“多重签名”？\n\n它只是一个需要多个签名才能批准交易的钱包。不是一个人能够批准付款，而是需要多方。DAO 传统上使用此框架来管理资金、防止滥用和权力下放。\n\n与某些替代解决方案不同，Gnosis Safe 支持 ERC-20s 和 ERC-721s 资产，允许 DAO 将 NFT 保存在多重签名钱包中。由于许多 NFT 的价格大幅上涨，强大的资金工具在这里变得越来越重要。\n\n其他著名组织\nDAO 有机会将接下来的 1 亿或更多用户带入 web3。作为组织发展和部署的基础结构，DAO 将揭示协调个人和专业参与的新方法，重新思考我们作为一个集体的运作和决策方式。\n\n当上面提到的工具和策略结合在一起时，值得强调一些使它们栩栩如生的流行项目。\n\nPartyDAO\n\nPartyDAO是设计和构建 DAO 工具的开发人员、作家、工程师和设计师的分散集合。他们的第一个产品“ PartyBid ”允许用户汇集资金来竞标 NFT。用户已经使用 PartyBid 汇集资金来竞标 Cryptopunks、Andrew Yang 的 NFT 和 CrypToadz。随着9 月底“ Party Splits ”的发布，PartyDAO 现在可以实现 NFT 的碎片化，分配所有权。\n\nMirror（镜子）\n\nMirror由 Denis Navaroz 创立，是一个去中心化的出版网络。通过 WRITE 代币的中介，用户可以支付 WRITE 来创建自己的镜像域，他们可以向该域发布文章并通过他们的投票权影响新成员的批准。\n\n很快，Mirror 已成为发布关于 web3 的想法和启动社区工作的事实上的地方。例如，Mirror 的 CTO 发起的“Crypto, Culture, & Society”利用该平台勾勒出一个加密学习 DAO，在此过程中筹集了 25 个 ETH。\n\nSeed Club\n\n种子俱乐部是一个建立、支持和投资代币化社区的 DAO。该社区包括社交令牌空间中的许多顶级影响者和创始人。种子俱乐部已经与著名的 DAO 和社区合作，包括 PartyDAO、Forefront、The Generalist 和 SquiggleDAO。\n\nFWB\n\n我们已经谈到了 FWB，但 DAO 的影响值得稍微讨论一下。就在本周，大型社交 DAO 宣布已从 a16z、Pace 和其他公司筹集了 1000 万美元的资金。\n\nFWB 是最大的加密思想家集合之一，并主持广泛的讨论。Discord 的一个频道可能会谈论音乐，另一个频道可能会谈论 NFT，而第三个频道可能会谈论投资。除了作为一种 web3 社交俱乐部，FWB 成员还积极为社区构建产品，正如所讨论的。简而言之，它正在成为加密货币真正的文化、生成之家。\n\nLAO\n\n根据定义，LAO不完全是一个 DAO。相反，创始人亚伦赖特的实体是一个“有限责任自治组织”。尽管保留了 DAO 的许多特征，但 LAO 是一个真正的特拉华州合并实体。通过将产品置于传统的法律世界，LAO 力求为其成员理顺和简化棘手的法律和税务问题。\n\n除了其差异化的结构之外，LAO 在投资 DAO 领域的影响力也非常出色。它不仅收到了超过 6500 万美元的捐款，还催生了一波子公司。这包括Flamingo（一个 NFT 集体）、Red DAO（一个数字时尚 DAO）、Neon（一个元节 DAO）、Neptune（一个 DeFi 流动性 DAO）等等。正如前面提到的 DAO 的多样性所指出的，有限责任结构可以在整个加密相关项目范围内提供帮助。\n\n鉴于这些实体在过去几年中一直在加密领域非常活跃，纸面回报几乎肯定是疯狂的。赖特本人在推特上表示，火烈鸟的资产管理规模有望达到 10 亿美元：\n\nMetaCartel\n\nMetaCartel是一个去中心化的建设者团体，他们最初致力于支持 Dapp 开发，但后来转向孵化 DAO。MetaCartel 对人们进行 DAO 教育，对现实世界的 DAO 进行案例研究，并协助与新 DAO 的开发和引导相关的所有事情。\n\nMetaCartel 还成立了一个名为 MetaCartel Ventures 的投资部门。反过来，它又投资了其他几个 DAO。\n\nMoloch DAO\n\nMoloch DAO最初成立是为了资助与 ETH 2.0 相关的以太坊公共基础设施的开发。从那时起，Moloch 已扩展为 Grants DAO，通过其赠款支持 Tornado Cash、Lodestar 和 Dapp 节点等项目。已经创建了许多子行会来评估申请资助的项目。\n\n此外，MolochDAO 提供了一个带有 v2 智能合约的开源 DAO 框架。我们之前注意到 Tribute 和 DAOhaus 都从 Moloch 的工作中受益。\n\nRabbithole\n\nRabbithole是一个学会赚钱的 DAO，它为消费者提供了一条了解加密货币的途径，同时还能获得奖励。\n\n在此过程中，Rabbithole 提供具有用户获取功能的加密协议。在过去的一年里，加密协议和产品的数量呈爆炸式增长，这使得一些项目很难找到并留住积极、熟练的参与者。\n\n通过“任务”，Rabbithole 帮助协议获得训练有素的社区成员，他们在此过程中展示了自己的能力。Aave、Opensea、Matcha、Perpetual Protocol 和 PoolTogether 已经与 Rabbithole 合作。\n\n随着新的 DAO 日益受到关注，预计这份有影响力的组织名单将在未来几个月和几年内迅速增长。\n\n为什么要启动 DAO？\n像我们在上一节中所做的那样概述环境使一些事情变得非常清楚：DAO 很难。即使在最好的时候，也很难协调一大群人朝着一个共同的目标前进。DAO 接受了这一挑战，增加了技术和社会复杂性的层（和层），并引入了巨大的经济波动。\n\n结果就像试图在一个新星球上建立一个国家，那里的人口每年增长 5,000%，而您的自然资源每天都在发生巨大变化。\n\n那么，为什么会有人想要创建 DAO？\n\n除了享受真正新颖且仍然具有革命性的事物之外，创建 DAO 的核心原因有以下三个：\n\n易于资本形成\n\n共享优势\n\n透明度\n\n易于资本形成\n简而言之，DAO 是汇集可由团体管理的资金的最简单方法之一。例如，它比建立一家传统的投资公司要简单得多，也便宜得多。\n\n由于 DAO 建立在公共区块链上，因此从一开始就受益于全球金融基础设施。启动由集体控制的共享钱包很简单。尽管加密入门仍有很多不足之处，但一旦您拥有钱包和一些代币，您就可以将这些代币转移到世界上的任何其他帐户，无论它们位于何处。从本质上讲，DAO 允许您创建具有协作功能的跨境基金。\n\n资本形成很重要，因为它使社区能够投资于他们关心的项目。在过去的几个月里，DAO 筹集了资金来收集 NFT、构建软件、创建互联网原生社交俱乐部、制作音乐、促进碳清除等等。\n\n共享优势\n正如我们所概述的，DAO 成员资格通常由加密代币强制执行。对于许多 DAO，如果您持有特定的 NFT 或数量的 ER-C20 代币，您将被视为“官方”成员。这些代币可以提供许多与治理、访问、状态、价值捕获等相关的功能。最后一点——价值捕获——至关重要，因为它允许人们通过为 DAO 做出贡献来谋生。\n\n从历史上看，项目的财务收益主要集中在创始人、早期员工和投资者身上。加密代币提供了一种奖励一系列利益相关者的流畅方式，包括自由职业者、服务提供商，甚至客户。\n\n应该说，对某些令牌缺乏可访问性存在合理的担忧。随着一些 DAO 变得越来越流行，它们的代币价格上涨，使得事实上的会员资格变得昂贵。\n\n许多 DAO 开始通过引入资助计划和奖学金来解决这个问题，这些计划和奖学金资助经济能力有限的高潜力成员。随着时间的推移，我们希望看到更多这样的举措。\n\n透明度\n正如我们在“哲学”部分所指出的，大多数 DAO 都具有很强的透明度文化。为此，许多 DAO 感觉更像是开源项目而不是公司。除了只是在公共场合构建之外，DAO 还可以在公共场合进行交流、加入、交易和治理。这有助于产生有意义的不同交互和行为。 以下是这在沟通、成员资格和治理方面的表现。\n\n沟通\n\n如上所述，DAO 倾向于使用 Discord 或 Telegram 进行同步通信。通常，任何人都可以加入公共渠道以了解有关该项目的更多信息。\n\n也有私人会员专用频道，虽然它们不会散发出最透明的氛围，但它们仍然是 DAO 历史和决策的重要记录。\n\n会员资格\n\n由于 DAO 成员资格通常以加密代币计价，因此任何人都可以查看相关信息。在链上，你可以看到有多少代币持有者，发现会员的价值，并检查随着时间的推移谁购买或出售了代币。\n\n有趣的是，由于加密代币用于会员身份，DAO 可以根据其代币持有量奖励其他DAO 的成员。例如，Rabbithole 可以向钱包中持有 $FWB 代币的任何人提供奖励。这可能会在未来几年迎来“成员可组合性”，允许社区以更亲社会的方式进行协作。\n\n治理\n\nDAO 的决策和资金流动也是透明的。社区成员可以提出新的倡议并对关键决策进行投票。这将治理变成了一种社会特征。\n\n例如，Nouns DAO 在过去三个月中从 NFT 拍卖中筹集了超过 5000 万美元，成员投票通过捐赠给慈善机构、构建 iOS 应用程序和出版漫画系列来花费这笔资金。尽管绝非万能药，但 DAO 结构确实有明显的好处。\n\n如何启动 DAO\n如果上面的部分激起了你的兴趣，你可能想知道如何开始一个 DAO。 虽然不是小事，形成一个DAO时创建一个DAO的多，更难的任务比较容易持久的价值。坦率地说，这个领域的新生意味着我们仍然不知道一个持久异常的 DAO 是什么样子。\n\n如果你只是希望旋转了一个DAO结构的缘故吧，在PlayBook可能类似于下面的鸣叫按撰稿人杰西斯洛斯列出的一个 ：\n\n出售一些 NFT，在您的社区中培养很酷的人，关闭 Discord，并丢弃一些代币。任务完成。\n\n但这实际上只是未来任务的开始。要了解如何构建具有真正价值的 DAO，缩小并查看大多数 DAO 发布涉及的四个阶段会很有帮助。\n\n1. 召唤冒险\n2. 所有权分配\n3. 治理\n4. 激励和奖励\n\n召唤冒险\n与“使命”或“愿景”等术语相比，对冒险的呼吁更准确地描述了参与者对 DAO 的购买。\n\n当然，加入是朝着一个目标前进，但前方的道路尤其朦胧且真正未曾涉足。那些加入的人正在报名参加逆境、潜在的失败以及在动态、流动的结构中与困难作斗争。\n\n来自 DAO 的一些奇妙的冒险呼吁：\n\nKrauseHouse寻求成为第一个由 DAO 拥有和管理的 NBA 特许经营权。\n\nGitCoin，正在建设和资助“数字公共产品”。\n\nFWB，它正在文化和加密的交叉点建立强大的影响力。\n\n所有权分配\n在吸引真正信徒的注意力后，DAO 需要分配所有权。 这是一项重要的任务，也是一项关键的设计决策。一些 DAO 从一开始就通过代币分配所有权，就像NFTx和Sushi 一样。其他人选择用较小的团队进行构建，然后在产品或社区证明需求和动力后分配所有权。Uniswap和Compound就是这里的例子。\n\n归根结底，DAO 可以通过多种方式将所有权分配给贡献者。一种方法是“空投”，即根据之前的操作（例如购买 NFT）将代币分发给成员。另一种是通过“赏金”；例如，当用户在其平台上了解加密项目时，Rabbithole 会提供代币。其他人通过去中心化交易所开放代币购买，例如 Uniswap。\n\n如果做得好，所有权分配会将代币交到具有一致价值观的个人和组织手中，这将有助于并帮助 DAO 向前发展。\n\n几个不同的 DAO 如何分配所有权的例子：\n\nSquiggle DAO要求你拥有一个 Squiggle NFT 才能加入 Discord。后来，$SQUIG 代币被空投。\n\nSuperRare向使用其 NFT 平台的艺术家和收藏家分发了 $RARE 代币。\n\nFWB要求会员拥有 75 美元的 FWB 代币。这些可以在 Uniswap 上购买，也可以通过赠款获得。\n\n治理\n决定如何作为一个群体做出决策是 DAO 启动过程的一个重要阶段。处理这种决策的团体通常被称为“治理结构”。web3 的一个有意义的部分非常关注这个主题，并不断研究新的方法论和方法。即使复仇创始人维塔利克·巴特林最近权衡的问题。\n\n在最简单的形式中，治理是在 DAO 或在 DAO 内运营的团队做出的决策中建立合法性的过程。\n\n治理结构有很多种，但最常见的决策方法是“代币加权投票”。 在这个系统中，一个代币代表一票。成员提出的提案和工具（如 Snapshot）允许用户表明他们对手头主题的偏好。这些投票的结果要么自动执行，要么由多重签名的签名者确认。\n\n一些治理结构最终看起来更像是直接民主国家，成员对大多数提案进行投票，而其他治理结构则充当代议制民主国家，其中具有授权的核心团队代表集团投票。治理结构通常会随着时间的推移而演变。\n\n“法案如何成为法律”的 DAO 版本可能是这样的：\n\n1. 讨论和塑造。一个成员在 Discord 中提出一个想法，这个想法是通过对话形成的，并建立了早期的共识。\n2. 提案的正式化。提案可能会发布在 Discourse 上，从而导致更正式的对话和评论。在此过程中，可以改进提案。\n3. 对该提案进行投票。使用 Snapshot，DAO 授权代币持有者在规定的时间内对提案进行投票。\n4. 提案的执行。一旦投票结束，多重签名者就会执行交易或操作。\n\n治理的重点是做出正确的决策并推动项目向前发展。善治确保声音被听到，合法性得到管理并建立势头。\n\n激励和奖励\nDAO 协调努力以实现目标；激励措施推动了这种努力。DAO 提供的第一个奖励通常是原生治理代币，它赋予早期贡献者所有权。\n\n虽然这些代币在市场上可能没有直接价值，但它们代表了个人为新组织做出贡献的相对价值，以及 DAO 集体价值的共享所有权。\n\n当然，并非所有奖励都是财政奖励。DAO 激励的类型包括：\n\n代币奖励。这些是上面提到的代币类型，赋予持有者所有权和影响力。\n\n社会资本。有价值的成员可能会在 Discord 上或通过 NFT 获得正式头衔。作为“主持人”或“领导者”可以授予 DAO 范围内的社会地位。\n\n账单支付代币。贡献者可能会获得更广泛流通的货币，如 USDC 或 ETH。这更类似于工资，因为流动性更高，并且持有的资产可以轻松兑换为当地法定货币。\n\n虽然这些奖励可能很强大，但要达到真正的规模，DAO 需要找到方法向贡献者支付足够的报酬，以便他们能够支付账单。\n\n一种方法是为 DAO 治理代币创建市场。Uniswap 和 Sushi 等工具使这成为可能，但它们使用起来可能很复杂。此外，只有非常成熟的组织才有可能在这里看到有意义的交易量。\n\n相反，大多数 DAO 需要将 USDC 或 ETH 存入他们的国库，作为支付贡献者努力的一种方式。DAO 可以通过在可能的情况下交换治理代币或产生链上收入来做到这一点。例如，DAO 可能会选择以 ETH 出售 NFT，可以将其添加到国库中，然后根据贡献者的贡献支付给他们。DAO 也可能同意为组织提供某些服务——比如区块链开发——以换取报酬。\n\n如何构建奖励的问题是大多数 DAO 花费大量时间的问题。DAO 在这方面的定义通常不太明确。没有老板，没有结构化的薪酬计划，甚至没有明确的角色。没有中央人力资源部门可以就工资做出决定。\n\n如果没有这种控制，DAO 会通过不同的机制奖励贡献者，其中一些我们已经讨论过：\n\n赏金奖励那些使用一定数量的代币完成明确定义的任务的贡献者。\n\n补助奖励贡献者为开展一个更大，更小良好定义的挑战与令牌的一组数。\n\nCoordinape Circles用其他贡献者众筹的代币奖励工作组的努力。\n\n可以定期向核心团队成员发放薪水，以奖励他们的努力。这通常以 USDC、ETH 和原生代币的混合形式支付。\n\nDAO 模型、流程和工具每天都在构建，通常是由需要它们的社区构建的。目前还没有真正的剧本，尽管 Sushi 和 Index Coop 都制定了结构化的招聘和薪酬方法。\n\n最终，如上所述，在许多情况下，目前针对 DAO 需求的每个阶段只有一两个常用的技术解决方案——与竞争服务于每个细分市场的丰富 SaaS 工具相去甚远。\n\n虽然参与像 DAO 这样的新兴模型有其挑战，但它带来了塑造下一个互联网的巨大机会。\n\n为 DAO 工作\n如果你还没有准备好开始一个 DAO，那些对这个领域感兴趣的人可以通过为一个人工作来赢得他们的支持。为了了解如何解决这个问题，我们将通过一个假设的招聘流程并解开不同的步骤，包括：\n\n选择你的职业\n\n寻找合适的角色\n\n入职\n\n合作\n\n获取报酬\n\n选择你的职业\n当谈到为 DAO 工作时，可能很难知道从哪里开始。DAO 中有哪些角色？真正需要什么样的人才？\n\n好消息是它比您想象的更简单。虽然根据 DAO 本身的重点肯定会有很多变化，但有一些共同的角色。\n\n社区管理者。当然，DAO 是社区。这使得这个角色特别重要——版主和经理是将项目凝聚在一起并帮助其向前推进的粘合剂。\n\n招聘人员和发起人。尤其是在早期，DAO 需要传福音，吸引优秀的人加入项目。招聘人员在这里很有价值。\n\n文士。通过 DAO 创建和传播大量信息。作家可以在清楚地记录这些信息方面产生影响，并为营销和知识做出贡献。\n\n艺术家。NFT 已成为 DAO 赚取收入的一种流行方式。因此，艺术能力和情感可能会受到高度追捧。\n\n工程师。一些 DAO 已经开始在 web3 领域构建自己的工具或其他产品。如果您是一名程序员，或者想成为一名程序员，DAO 提供了一个学习的机会。\n\n司库。正如我们所提到的，DAO 管理大型 AUM。他们需要精明的财务运营商来帮助有效管理和部署支出。\n\n当然，这远非详尽无遗。游戏设计师、数字营销人员和各种其他功能对 DAO 很有用。\n\n寻找合适的角色\n您如何在 DAO 世界中找到空缺？ 事实是，没有正式的发现过程，大多数机会都是在 Twitter、封闭式 Discord 聊天或加密播客上偶然出现的。尽管这种不透明性使得闯入变得更加困难，但缺乏“工作板”可能让人感觉像是一个功能而不是一个错误。人们首先通过与他们信任的社区互动来找到他们关心的机会。\n\n入职\n一旦你找到了一个你想加入的 DAO，然后呢？ 入职体验往往因 DAO 的不同而有很大差异，尽管高质量的组织通常在这方面表现出色。毕竟，如果新成员有合适的背景和支持，他们就能更好地做出贡献。\n\n为此，一些 DAO 组织了结构化的新成员入职电话会议，类似于大学开放日。Index Coop是一家创建加密指数产品的去中心化资产管理公司，每周举办新加入者会议，并提供名为“Cooper Owl Quest”的详细指南，了解如何开始。\n\n索引合作社手册\n像 NounsDAO 这样以用户生成的创造力为中心的 DAO 采用了不同的方法。Nouns 创建了一个游乐场并开放了工具，因此成员可以开始参与社区的工作，并随后获得社区资金的资助。\n\n合作\n一旦您进入，就可以开始增加价值。  对于 DAO，其中大部分是通过协作实现的。DAO 的决策权是分布式的，而不是定义工作流的集中管理团队。每个人都有权表达他们对未来的愿景，领导团队通常来自能够识别社区需求并努力解决这些需求的人。\n\n这种自下而上的方法在整个 DAO 环境中都是可见的。例如，一个由六名专门的 Sushi 贡献者组成的团队申请了一项资助，以帮助解决用户故障并创建一个多语言客户服务门户。这样的举措在 DAOS 中很经典——贡献者发现了 Sushi 生态系统中的一个痛点，主动提出了一个解决方案，请求和接收资源，并开始构建。\n\n这项工作在哪里完成？\n\n正如我们所提到的，Discord 和 Discourse 是流行的对话场所。剩下的大部分合作发生在 Google Docs、Notion、Airtable、Figma 和 Github 等地方。虽然强大的平台，但没有一个是为 web3 异常流畅的团队构建的。\n\n一方面，这些平台将用户信息存储在集中式数据库上，并且通常根据个人在组织中的角色分配访问权限。DAO 的运作方式不同，角色和贡献者可能希望保持匿名。\n\n我们应该期待在未来几年出现原生的 web3 生产力堆栈。这可能会根据社区内的代币持有量和过去的贡献授予权限。\n\n获取报酬\n我们主要介绍了 DAO 贡献者为换取他们的努力而获得的不同类型的奖励。 另一个值得注意的主题是 DAO 有时将补偿与某些 KPI 联系起来。UMA 项目创建了一个框架，如果 DAO 在给定的到期日期之前达到预定目标，则该框架将支付更多合成代币。\n\n虽然这可能是一种激励，但存在社区对错误指标过度编制索引的风险。此外，不良行为者可能会想方设法玩弄系统，从而最大限度地提高对某些 KPI 的贡献，但却避开有意义的工作。任何时候算法或程序控制对花环的访问，都不可避免地有人会试图操纵它。\n\n法律问题\n在最好的意义上，区块链和基于区块链的系统（如 DAO）旨在在法律范围之外运行。由于部署了技术，这些实体遵守封装为基于区块链的代码的自治规则。尽管如此，该技术是可调节的。\n\n今天，与许多传统法律实体和其他商业协会相比，DAO 以不同的假设运作。DAO 是流动的设计，不是由董事会或经理管理，而是旨在由民主或高度参与的流程或算法管理。与扎根于某个司法管辖区的传统组织不同，DAO 遍布全球，将成千上万的成员拼接在一起，无论他们住在哪里；唯一的要求是互联网连接。DAO 通常试图避免书面协议或其他形式的法律手续，成员主要同意使用软件和代码规则来遵守和管理他们的事务。\n\n虽然在大多数司法管辖区没有定义，但怀俄明州（有限责任公司的原始创建者）最近通过了一项法律，授予在区块链上运营的 DAO 具有合法公司地位，前提是它们被组织为怀俄明州有限责任公司。“平等国家”的这种颇具前瞻性的观点为 DAO 成员提供了责任保护。如果没有这样的保障措施，DAO 可以被视为普通合伙企业，如果出现问题，则让成员承担个人责任。虽然怀俄明州是先行者，但我们看到许多其他司法管辖区正在深入思考 DAO 的未来。利用有限责任状态结构的 DAO 示例包括前面提到的 LAO（基于风险的 DAO）及其一些相关结构。\n\nTribute Labs（前身为 OpenLaw）一直在探索替代结构，包括“非法人非营利组织”或 UNA。当一群人想要组建一个协会而不必通过注册将其正式化时，可以创建这种方式。UNA 结构被用于数字博物馆MUSE0的建设，收藏家和艺术家在这里捐赠 NFT，社区决定是否应该进入永久收藏。\n\nMuse0 系列\n虽然启动 UNA 不需要任何文书工作，但如果非法人协会的目的包括盈利意图，那么就已经创建了普通合伙企业。实际上，UNA 非常适合想要采取非盈利性质的行动并需要制定指导原则的团体。\n\nDAO 的重要性日益增加，并且有早期迹象表明，基于区块链的治理将对公司的治理方式产生重大影响——无论是通过数字化传统治理机制还是提供从根本上组织企业的新方法。\n\n从法律上讲，前进的道路正在明确，支持者应该对未来的道路保持谨慎乐观。\n\n反对 DAO\n虽然有很多理由看好 DAO，但这是一个处于起步阶段的空间。实现大规模部署和采用需要时间和精力。\n\n即使考虑到这一点，DAO 也并不完美。尽管现代公司有其问题，DAO 是对它们缺陷的回应，但我们不应该假装公司结构一无是处。这样做将无视数百年来吸取的教训。\n\n例如，管理合理的公司在其运营中承担两项关键责任。\n\n1. 信托责任。公司所有权和管理很少完全重叠。因此，负责公司决策的人（想想高管或董事会）必须以股东（真正的所有者）的最佳利益而非他们自己的最佳利益行事。\n2. 少数民族保护。不同的股东群体通常在一家公司拥有不同的股份。公平公司的运作必须使公司相对于所有股东的股份平等地受益。大股东群体不能强迫其他股东遵守以牺牲少数人为代价，不成比例地奖励多数人的要求。\n\n这些是健全企业的基本运营，不遵守这些规则的企业将面临法律诉讼的可信威胁。但是，很难在 DAO 中重新创建类似的操作，至少不进行权衡。\n\n一方面，在违约的情况下，没有传统的法院可以依靠。此外，由于 DAO 本质上是作为智能合约运行的无需信任的计算机程序，因此它无法确定某个提案是否满足了信托责任，或者小股东是否得到了充分保护。这种判断从根本上是主观的，不能被软件很好地解释。\n\n大多数时候这可能并不重要，但如果 DAO 的投票权落入坏人之手，这将变得非常重要。例如，如果一个不良行为者（或恶意团体）成功地获得了 51% 的投票权重（或超过了设定的任何阈值），他们可能会提议并批准对组织进行不成比例地奖励他们的变革，代价是社区的其他成员。\n\nDAO 可能没有能力阻止这种情况，尤其是在软件级别。对于 DAO 的代码，合法的提议和威胁组织存在的提议看起来完全一样。由于社区内的人在上述情况下将无法保护自己，因此解决问题需要来自能够进行此类评估的可信外部来源的输入。\n\n化名使问题进一步复杂化。许多人使用“丢弃身份”为 DAO 做出贡献，这意味着不良行为者的声誉风险很小。在一个完全对抗性的环境中，DAO 对任何人都开放，违反上述属性几乎没有什么阻碍——至少没有任何外部激励。如果有机会，一些人可能认为泄露 DAO 的资源是值得的，特别是因为它们可以在没有归属的情况下运行。\n\n为什么我们没有看到更多这样的攻击？\n\n在某种程度上，这可能是由于其他激励因素在起作用。在许多 DAO 中，代币供应集中在少数创始人或信誉良好的投资者手中。这些人通常会考虑长远并披露了他们的身份，这意味着声誉风险受到威胁。任何攻击都可能被这些鲸鱼击落，即使它们的理性经济决策是支持它。这种可能性甚至阻止了此类操作的尝试。\n\n在许多情况下，那些负责管理 DAO 多重签名的人也可能相对容易地违背社区的利益。然而，随着 DAO 和 web3 规范的世界积累的社会资本阻止了这种行为，即使没有什么能阻止他们自私地行事。\n\n已经提出了其他方法来解决这些风险，包括愤怒戒烟和否决。\n\n愤怒戒烟\nMoloch DAO 具有“愤怒退出”机制，允许代币持有者以其资产的比例份额退出 DAO。至关重要的是，愤怒的戒烟者会带着他们在提案正式通过之前所拥有的份额离开，除非他们投票赞成。本质上，如果您不喜欢 DAO 刚刚做出的决定，您可以打包并随身携带您的代币。\n\n对于潜在的攻击者来说，这种退出机制的存在是一个主要障碍。如果贡献者认为攻击正在进行，他们可以带着自己的资金离开，而不是被迫加入。即使潜在的强盗积累了 51% 的多数，他们也可能无法获得任何资金。\n\n愤怒退出机制的缺点是它是一种非常核方法。此外，它对于持有 NFT 等不可替代资产的 DAO 并不是特别好。如果你、我和我们的 98 位朋友每人投入 1 ETH 购买一些无聊的猿，并且你决定放弃愤怒，我们如何允许你带着你的部分股份离开？没有简单的答案。\n\n最终，任何使用这种方法的大型 DAO 都会将其与对成员的全面审查过程结合起来。这确保了社会资本处于危险之中，从一开始就阻止了流氓提议的发生。\n\n否决\n一些 DAO 不是愤怒地退出，而是通过否决来防止攻击。在这种情况下，受信任的实体或机制会介入以确保提案的合法性并关闭恶意行为。\n\n例如，Nouns DAO 的创始人可以否决恶意提案，但他们计划随着时间的推移“可证明撤销”该权利。同样，这里的方法依赖于社会资本而不是代码。\n\n一些协议试图通过提供主观输入来正面解决问题。例如，阿拉贡法院通过“监护人”网络帮助处理此类纠纷。当出现问题时，可以将判决推迟到这个独立的法院，他们的公正努力会得到奖励。Kleros 的“正义协议”是一个类似的解决方案。\n\n除了攻击威胁之外，DAO 还必须解决一些围绕其结构有效性的悬而未决的问题。分散的方法可能会产生最好的结果吗？\n\n高影响力的初创公司已经融合在一个相当默认的运营手册上，其中高层领导推动组织的方向，知识产权是专有的，招聘是结构化的，保密是至关重要的。在过去的几十年里，这种方法产生了一些非常出色的结果。\n\n当然，DAO 的行为有所不同，它们倾向于完全透明的扁平结构。虽然这种模型在去中心化至关重要的情况下被证明非常有效（比特币和以太坊可以被认为是 DAO），但尚不清楚它是否适合其他类型的组织。\n\n看到 DAO 与特定市场中的中心化团队竞争，并观察该模型的相对优势和劣势所在，将会非常有趣。\n\n边境\n或许 DAO 世界最令人兴奋的地方在于，我们几乎没有触及它潜力的表面。尽管新技术在部署的方式、地点和原因方面不可避免地让我们感到惊讶，但尝试并设想它们可能预示的未来还是值得的。\n\n在这个主题上，我们将涉及 DAO 对我们未来的重要性、所有权和创造力的变化概念以及潜在的新组织时代。\n\nDAO 的重要性\n不断扩大的贫富差距是我们作为一个社会面临的最大逆风之一，而 COVID-19 的后果只会加剧这一问题。这不仅仅是一个道德问题，也是一个经济问题。残酷的事实是，劳动力和工资并不是建立可持续财富的最佳解决方案；资产所有权和获得资本是。从历史上看，那些拥有资本的人与提供劳动力的人相比，通常会获得不成比例的收益，这通常是为了换取固定工资。再说一遍，如果你想变得富有并获得财务自由，你需要拥有资产——资本>劳动力。\n\nWeb3 对很多人来说意义重大，但正如我们所讨论的，它的核心支柱之一是所有权的概念。通过更广泛地传播这种资本，该空间有可能将数百万人从传统的雇佣劳动中拖出并转向所有权。\n\n货币贬值的背景只会强化这种感觉，即在世界需要加密货币的那一刻，它正在成为一种可广泛投资的资产类别。\n\nDAO 是这一运动的关键部分。它们不仅本身就是创造财富的机会，而且还可能在进入生态系统的人的教育和技能提升方面发挥主导作用。\n\n创造力\n正如我们许多人所知，所有阶层的公民都越来越担心自动化、人工智能和机器人技术的进步将取代当今的许多工作，而这种担心并非完全错误。然而，web3 和相关 DAO 的爆炸式增长可能会催生数百个新行业、数千个新组织和数百万个以前不存在的新工作。\n\n创造力可能会受到特别的影响。随着死记硬背的劳动被自动化，敏锐度更高的人才可能会脱颖而出。一个日益机械化的世界也可能鼓励连接，即使是通过数字领域。\n\nDAO 是这两种趋势的完美体现。Creator DAO 将使艺术家能够与粉丝互动，并在许多情况下创造世代财富。反过来，其中大部分内容将与帮助生成它的人共享。\n\nMicah Johnson就是这种可能性变为现实的例子。约翰逊，前 MLB 球员和活跃艺术家，是一个名为Aku的基于 NFT 的角色的创造者。阿库不仅成为了一个受欢迎的化身，约翰逊的作品也得到了 Visa 的赞助。不难想象“Akuverse”在未来几年可能会如何扩展，产生一个真正的 DAO 和一个参与社区。\n\nAku World 阿库世界\n新的组织结构\n截至目前，所有传统资产都是有效的法律结构，资产持有人的权利由法院强制执行。\n\n随着越来越多的资产在链上转移，智能合约和程序化激励将取代法律体系作为保证所有权的一种方式。同样，DAO 将取代法人实体，成为围绕这些资产进行协调的主要方法。个人不是组建公司，而是创建 DAO 来管理链上资产。\n\n正如我们所提到的，DAO 是对传统公司的范式转变，因为它们从一开始就可以是全球性的，无需许可即可加入或贡献，并最大限度地减少诸如身份、雇佣合同、工作面试甚至实时赔偿。虽然今天这个过程中有很多问题，但我们有充分的理由相信，随着时间的推移，这些问题会得到解决。\n\n简而言之，加密为产权和全球“无需许可”的金融体系提供了更强大的保护，任何人都可以利用它以比当今过时的替代方案更有效的方式将资产转换为资本。\n\nDAO 是否会兑现其非凡的承诺还有待观察，过去的十年比我们想象的更陌生、更黑暗、更神奇，下一次可能会带来更大的转变。\n\n不过，相信强大的、积极的变化是合理的。如果您免费、开放地访问一个充满远见的新领域，有些人会找到一种方法来改善许多人的生计。少数人和多数人可能会发现自己不是为公司工作，而是为 DAO 工作——一个流动的、不断变化的数字空间角落，吸收了互联网。", "timestamp":

，如果当初买了一点没有卖出，心里会好受点。\n\n跟随热点炒币，赚了是行情赏脸。没有赚，想想主要还是自己的思想问题。\n\n行情好的时候，随便买个热点币都能暴涨。\n\n行情不好的时候，就算买的是价值币也能暴跌。\n\n炒币炒的的是短期行情，当断则断，不要妄想长期持有，如果你害怕会继续暴涨，那就留一点 。\n\n有的人炒热点币是为了套利，热点币在暴涨的同时，有些平台的价格会存在差价，在这个交易所低价买入，再把币提到价格高的地方。当然，如果你嫌弃搬砖的手续费高，也可以直接等价格涨了再卖，这个时候你要衡量的风险是，如果后面涨的价格比其他交易所低又或者会不会一直不涨，总而言之，尽量把各种风险考虑到。一般来说，最后有赚就好。\n\nmana和sand都是跟元宇宙相关的币种，最近两天实现了翻倍行情。\n\n我看见已经有大佬提示了有关元宇宙的币会火起来。虽然ta没有说具体是哪个币,但这种事最好还是自己领会比较好。\n\n没想到，就两三天时间，mana和sand涨了几倍。\n\n这些币在个人看来就是跟随热点炒起来的。\n\n至于后面会不会真的跟元宇宙有联系，其实大家都不会很在乎。\n\n泡沫是推动牛市高潮的催化剂，学会拥抱泡沫，在泡沫散开之前下车有何不可？\n\n（二）\n\n一直在圈内学习实践，最后总会有所收获。\n　　\n不怕你们笑话，pink是我参与了将近一年多的项目，虽然笔者不算是最早的参与者，但一直有参与

，比起高年化的野矿稳多了。\n\n如果你早期就拥有pink，可以用pink和波场做市挖pink，年化在189%左右。\n\npink的波场挖矿支持波场单币挖，实际年化在20%左右。\n　　\n单币eth挖，实际年化20%左右。\n　　\n单币usdt挖pink，实际年化20%左右。\n\n单币pink挖pink，实际年化20%左右。\n\n以前我也是对pink有着极大的偏见，现在我变成了pink的长期持有者，如果你也看好pink，看好pink的未来，欢迎你来到粉红梦庄园

Around 2017, there were collectible trading games in the industry, which combined the \"transaction attribute\" and \"unique private property of assets\" of blockchain with gameplay. However, blockchain games at this time can only be called chain games, and do not have the characteristics of GameFi.\n\nThe emergence of GameFi benefits from the conceptual maturity of NFT and the development of DEFI field, under the framework of the blockchain metauniverse concept. The only way to complete the metaverse concept is to map reality to the blockchain world.\n\n当 Metasverse 的游戏形式与 NFT 和 DEFI 概念相结合时，链上金融系统被游戏化。2020年，GameFi概念提出并被业界广泛接受。因此，GameFi 从 2020 年下半年开始的一系列发展就受到了区块链行业的重视。\n\n经过一年多的市场测试，GameFi在数字资产价值和链游戏价值交互方面展现了其独特的生态。\n\n自 2021 年 3 月以来，GameFi 经历了爆发式增长。到 2021 年 9 月，GameFi 已经成长为区块链行业的一个独立部分，预计在短期内将超过 DEFI。\n\n03 优势分布式，参与运营，获得收益\n\nGameFi 的基本理念是基于区块链，因此 GameFi 自然具有传统行业所不具备的分布式优势。\n\n游戏中的每个玩家都可以完全控制自己的游戏角色、资产、道具，并可以通过治理通证引领链游戏的发展方向，玩家可以通过投票来升级和完善链游戏。\n\n链游去中心化结构在运营方面的优势在于，玩家可以参与到链游的运营和维护中。游戏越流行，玩家体验就会越好。玩家越多，越早的玩家受益。\n\nGameFi 现在广泛使用 Play to Eran 经济模型，其中游戏产生的真钱是玩家积极性和忠诚度的保证。\n\nAs of September 2021, DappRadar data shows that GameFi has a total of 836 online games, with an average of 1 million users and $15.62 million transactions per day.\n\nAccording to relevant data statistics, since July, the data of chain games has been growing rapidly. The number of players has increased from 80,000 in early April to 928,000 in September, and the daily trading volume has increased from 500,000 in early April to an average level of about 40 million dollars, with the highest daily trading volume exceeding 93 million dollars.\n\n04 summary\n\nGameFi has become one of the most promising areas in the industry, and as the metasverse concept becomes more popular, GameFi will gain more attention and participation.\n\n虽然 GameFi 领域的日交易量现在接近 1 亿美元，但鉴于市场的广度及其与资产交互的能力，GameFi 的潜力尚未完全爆发。\n\n毕竟距离GameFi这个概念提出才一年多。由于GameFi仍处于该领域的早期阶段，其未来的发展和前景无疑值得期待。", "timestamp": 1635948823, "digest": "qb2meUbYIjWyrJjQVu1achvuZqFgEpIp6ug6IUGs8D0", "contributor": "0x4123c900e0Ce5B0f59d5c23d8788622b28CF391C"}

His design of Bit Gold, widely considered as a precursor to Bitcoin, came out before Bitcoin was introduced to the world by Satoshi Nakamoto. Additionally, he was the inventor of the concept of smart contract, which was brought to a great height by Ethereum. Though Szabo was all for Ethereum in the beginning, he then took a clear-cut stand in opposition. One could not help but wonder, what happened in between that this cypherpunk did a 180 on Ethereum?\n\nThis article presents a timeline of Szabo’s change in attitude, supported by a selection of his open comments on different platforms, i.e. social media. Placed in the context of the history of Ethereum, an analysis is conducted on incidents triggering Szabo’s negativity, building on which conclusions are made relating to his stances towards Ethereum and the value of his opinion on the development of the community.\n\n## Where it started\n\nEarly in 1994, in the opening of his [paper](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart.contracts.html), Szabo coined the term smart contract:\n\n\"A smart contract is a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract. The general objectives of smart contract design are to satisfy common contractual conditions …, minimize exceptions both malicious and accidental, and minimize the need for trusted intermediaries.\"\n\nSmart contracts stayed a concept for a long time until the blockchain was brought to life. While Bitcoin was the first to support smart contracts through its script, it is considered to be Turing Incomplete and restricted by the finite number of situations in which it is used. Ethereum, on the other hand, is the platform that truly popularized smart contracts.\n\nIn 2013, Vitalik, founder of Ethereum, adopted the concept of “smart contract” in [Ethereum Whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/), titled *A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform*. To pay his tribute, Vitalik named a unit of ether after Szabo (1 ether = 1000000 Szabo), showing a great extent of respect for this living legend.\n\nAnd this is where the story between Szabo and Ethereum started.\n\n## How it went down\n\n### Positive (2014 - 2016?)\n\nInitially, Szabo was a firm advocate of Ethereum and was on great terms with the community. In November 2015, he was invited to the Ethereum DEVCON1 held in London and delivered a keynote speech “[Smart Contracts and Ethereum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y3fWXA6d5k)”, from which we can take a glimpse of his optimism in the integration between the two.\n\nMeanwhile, Szabo paid his compliment to Ethereum effusively on a variety of public platforms, from Twitter to podcasts. To name a few:\n\nOn August 2nd, 2014, he tweeted:\n\n*   [Ethereum has the best ideas in block chain tech.](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/495300992049479680)\n\nIn September 2015, he said in a podcast:\n\n*   [I sometimes make the comparison of a pocket calculator \\[Bitcoin\\] versus, say, a general purpose computer \\[Ethereum\\].](https://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/lets-talk-bitcoin-246-smart-contracts-with-nick-szabo)\n\nOn February 14th, 2016, he replied under a Twitter thread:\n\n*   [Most breakthroughs start off as seemingly unrealistic and definitely unrealized. And often as Bitcoin & Ethereum as white papers.](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/698580881665974272)\n\n### Negative (2016? - )\n\nLater, however, all his remarks about Ethereum on social media went negative, especially after 2016 (the exact time to be discussed in this article). For example:\n\nOn June 5th, 2017, he retweeted Vitalik with a comment:\n\n*   [Ethereum is headed for either a huge bureaucracy or disaster.](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/871462865206509568)\n\nOn August 19th, 2018, he replied\n\n*   [Computational scalability and a governance model that violates immutability are both huge problems for Ethereum.](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1030929448034418688)\n\nOn October 21st, 2019, when asked about his shift in attitude to Etherum on a podcast, he responded that:\n\n*   [The attitudes of leadership changed. It’s in their self-interests now to preach a pro-centralization ideology.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RZgq0mtD18)\n\n### A u-turn with no witness\n\nIt seems unlikely that such a volte-face came out of nowhere.\n\nFrom search results on Twitter, Szabo made his last positive comment about Ethereum on February 14th, 2016, and the first negative on June 5th, 2017. During this span of more than a year, he never chimed in about Ethereum on this platform.\n\nApart from Twitter, on which Szabo makes most of his voice, he also has a personal blog called “[Unenumerated](https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/)” with long articles posted occasionally, most recently updated in 2018. Likewise, no trace was left here.\n\nIt is thus hard to pin down exactly when things changed. When did he make this u-turn? There is no direct link to follow.\n\n*Timeline of Szabo’s Comments and Attitudes towards Ethereum*\n\n## What is it about Ethereum that turned away Szabo?\n\nSince the attitude change, Szabo has never had a good word about Ethereum on Twitter. “Centralized” is the term brought up the most in his critiques. At the same time, he constantly talked about his core insistence - trust minimization.\n\nFor instance, in 2019, [Szabo avowed that](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1170009986216296448) he has “abandoned (Ethereum) long ago, in no small part due to Ethereum leadership’s poor understanding of governance and **trust minimization**.”\n\n[He also pointed out “an undeniable evidence”](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1183931593800306689): “claiming immutability & censorship resistance on the one hand, attacking **trust minimization** principles on the other, claiming **decentralization** while devolving into **centralized** cult.”\n\nWhen asked whether ETH is a “shitcoin”, [he replied](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1184525892514701312), “Sadly, yes, Ethereum, which once sounded so promising, has become a shitcoin as a result of devolving into a **centralized** cult.”\n\nMeanwhile, according to Szabo, [the reason why the development of DeFi on Ethereum fell short was that](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1184541939472961538) “you don’t have nearly enough influence to make Ethereum sufficiently **trust-minimized** for any DeFi that is a substantial improvement…”\n\nBesides, [he also commented on the current status of cryptocurrency](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1184523046704635904), and criticized that “multitudes and charlatans have entered the cryptocurrency and smart contract spaces who not only lack cypherpunk sensibilities, but hate cypherpunk values, including the values such as **trust minimization** that give cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin their market values.”\n\n*Keyword Cloud related to Ethereum posted by Szabo on Twitter*\n\nAccording to Szabo, the power center of Ethereum is the leadership team headed by Vitalik Buterin and Vlad Zamfir. Vitalik is the well-known co-founder of Ethereum; Vlad used to serve as a key researcher of Ethereum, whose work on cryptoeconomics, PoS consensus mechanism, and blockchain sharding within the Ethereum ecosystem is widely received.\n\nIt was Vlad who started the war. In January 2019, he posted [*Against Szabo’s Law, For A New Crypto Legal System*](https://medium.com/cryptolawreview/against-szabos-law-for-a-new-crypto-legal-system-d00d0f3d3827), in which he positioned himself against “Szabo’s law” and called it “bullshit”. As he said, Szabo’s law is simple: Do not implement changes to the blockchain protocol unless the changes are required for the purpose of technical maintenance. It can also justifiably be called “blockchain governance minimization” and “crypto law minimization”.\n\nThis is indeed an extension of Szabo’s view on decentralization and trust minimization. However, Szabo himself has never claimed his creation of such a law on any occasion; it looked like these words were put into his mouth.\n\nSzabo did not respond to Vlad’s provocation. However, as Vlad cornered him with constant Tweet attacks, he finally fought back. Szabo condemned that [Vlad went way off with centralization and the personal attacks were uncalled for](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1183858161603629056). He went further and denounced that the team at Ethereum connived at his behavior.\n\nSzabo also [accused](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1328255985941581824) Vitalik of being “quite in favor of centralized parties censoring things based on his preconceived (and in this case legally false) opinions. That’s why he only pretends to give a shit about Ethereum ‘decentralization’. He’d love to hold kangaroo courts over the DeFI billions.”\n\nThe flame war ended with Szabo blocking Vlad and whoever supported him on Twitter, Vitalik included, of course.\n\nSzabo’s keen understanding of decentralization and trust minimization might originate from his own life experience.\n\nNick Szabo’s parents are Hungarians, and his father participated in the 1956 Hungarian Revolution against the Soviet Union. To escape from the pro-Soviet regime established after World War II in Hungry, the whole family fled to the United States and settled there. As a son in a Hungarian refugee family, Szabo grew up having little trust in a centralized government, and was surrounded by horrifying stories of private property being looted, people oppressed and even murdered. He personally experienced the hazard caused by abuses of state power, which contributed to his firm standpoint. [In an interview](https://medium.com/zulurepublic/towards-a-trust-minimized-world-an-interview-with-nick-szabo-90b900947683), he said that: “If you had just been born and raised in the US, you might not have known as much about the potential for government to be abused. So, to my mind if you can substitute — there’s many important functions government does — if you can substitute less violent and less abusable ways to perform those functions, that’s a big win.” In his opinion, a trust-minimized system is a solution to preventing the abuse of centralized power.\n\nIn 2001, Szabo published a well-known article [*Trusted Third Parties are Security Holes*](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/), a systematic elaboration of his core opinions, which is widely acknowledged. He believes that in a security protocol design, the existence of a “trusted third party” constitutes the introduction of a security hole into that design. If a security protocol is reliant on a trusted third party, it entails security risks caused by centralization, which, therefore, inevitably brings high security costs. Eventually, both the high risks and costs will be passed on to the users of the protocol. To close such a security gap, the trusted third party should be excluded, to an extent that trust is minimized.\n\nAll Szabo’s conceptions throughout his life exemplified his philosophy of “trust minimization”: the notion behind Bit Gold is to avoid the involvement of trust in centralized currency issuers; smart contracts aim at reducing trust in third-party transaction intermediaries.\n\nSzabo opened his arms to Ethereum because it was a decentralized smart contract platform that upheld the principle of decentralization and trust minimization. When the principle went out of the window, of course this determined cypherpunk would switch to the opposite side in no time.\n\nSo, what happened that led Szabo to believe Ethereum had given up on decentralization?\n\n## Is Ethereum going down the road of centralization?\n\n“Szabo’s law”, as explained earlier, despite its stretch from Szabo’s opinion on paper, is a spot-on conclusion. No change shall be made to the blockchain protocol unless it is required for the purpose of technical maintenance. In other words, governance of and changes to blockchain protocol should be limited to the minimum, amounting to the principle of “governance minimization”, an extension of “decentralization” and “trust minimization”. These have been Szabo’s core values from the very beginning.\n\nAny modification to blockchain protocol, as can be imagined, could easily upset believers of such values. As a matter of fact, during the whole year when Szabo kept quiet about Ethereum (Feb 2016 to Jun 2017), there were several changes made to the Ethereum protocol:\n\n1.  **March 15th, 2016, Homestead upgrade.** Homestead is the second major version of the Ethereum platform, an optimization long-planned in the white paper.\n2.  **July 20th, 2016, The DAO hard fork.** An attacker found a vulnerability in the coding that allowed him to drain funds from The DAO. To retrieve the loss, a hard fork was executed and funds were returned to the investors.\n3.  **October 18th, 2016, Tangerine Whistle upgrade:** an upgrade to the protocol in response to the denial of service (DoS) attacks on the network (September/October 2016).\n4.  **November 23rd, 2016, Spurious Dragon upgrade**: as above, the second response to the DoS attacks on the network.\n\nAmong them, **the one that caught the most attention was the highly disputable **[**The DAO hard fork**](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/20/hard-fork-completed/)**. This incident exerted a fundamental influence on Ethereum, which can be seen as its first centralization crisis.**\n\nIn 2016, The DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, gathered over ten million Ether (worth around $150M at the time) through an ICO. However, a loophole on the smart contract was spotted and exploited, resulting in over 30% of ethers raised being stolen. To refund the lost money, the Ethereum Foundation team decided to hard-fork the Ethereum blockchain to restore all funds to the original contract and fix the bug. This move was not supported by all members of the community and was especially controversial among the miners, leading to a fork in Ethereum, where the original blockchain was maintained as Ethereum Classic, and the other the current Ethereum.\n\nThis incident was highly contentious. Supporters believe that the hard fork stopped the hacker from getting away and protected the interests of The Dao users; justice was well served. Objectors, on the other hand, reckon it a serious violation of blockchain immutability and decentralization. One of the main reasons why people embrace blockchain and support Ethereum is that they abominate the inherent arbitrariness of traditional centralized institutions in changing rules and data. If Ethereum can also reverse transactions through hard-fork, how is it any different from traditional centralized institutions?\n\nFurthermore, the Ethereum Foundation’s involvement and promotion of The DAO project has also been heavily criticized. The DAO was the largest and most influential project in the Ethereum ecosystem at the time, and several core members of the Ethereum Foundation were holders of DAO tokens and advisors to The DAO project. The quasi-official nature of the project meant that any failure would strike the whole ecosystem critically. Therefore, the Ethereum Foundation team had to step up and rescue The DAO up against the infamy of tampering rules. Who could have imagined the vile story of Wall Street’s “too big to fail” could happen in the world of blockchain? This is undoubtedly a huge irony to the decentralized spirit of blockchain.\n\nTo fork or not to fork: that is a question. After The Dao attack, the Ethereum community took the initiative and launched an on-chain vote, [Carbon Vote](http://v1.carbonvote.com/), to collect the community’s opinion on whether a hard fork should be implemented. The final result was an overwhelming (87%) support. However, [this vote was not quite convincing for several reasons](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-dao-is-history-or-is-it-47a6f457338a):\n\n*   Carbon Vote counts the ballot in correspondence to the number of ETH under the from-address. Whether it is Ether Foundation or Slock.it, the company that launched The DAO project, both of them owned huge amounts of Ether and are parties involved in the incident. The support from these whale addresses could easily sway the vote.\n*   At the time, the distribution of ethers was very uneven, with 25% of the votes coming from a single address. It is therefore unfair to call the voting result a community decision.\n*   Only less than 6% of Ether holders voted. Many were not aware of this Carbon Vote or simply did not know how to vote.\n\nEventually, the result of this unofficial Carbon Vote was used as evidence of “community supports hard-fork” by the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nSzabo has never spoken about The DAO hard fork in public, but indirectly expressed his opinion on The DAO token offering by commenting on the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nIn July 2017, [the SEC released a research report on DAO tokens issued on Ethereum in 2016](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-131). According to the report, U.S. securities laws should be followed in the sale and trading of DAO tokens. Although the SEC said that it will not pursue the legal responsibility of DAO token offering and trading for the time being, and it recognized that the application of securities law to ICO should be based on the actual situation, the SEC made clear its attitude of bringing ICO projects into the scope of regulation.\n\nSzabo [tweeted](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/890321836990316544): “SEC tl;dr: TheDAO broke our regs like crazy, but we aren’t going to do anything about it except write words to scare other people.”\n\nThere is no doubt that Szabo is opposed to The DAO incident, though he never declared himself. Vlad, on the other hand, bluntly stated in [his article criticizing Szabo’s law](https://medium.com/cryptolawreview/against-szabos-law-for-a-new-crypto-legal-system-d00d0f3d3827) that: “The DAO hard fork was a clear violation of Szabo’s Law, and it offended Nick enough that he disowned Ethereum…”\n\nAdditionally, Reddit user cyounessi([former Head of Risk Management at MakerDAO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyounessi/)) [claimed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6fbgdq/nick_szabo_to_vitalik_who_is_we_programmers/dii93q4?utm_source=share\\&utm_medium=web2x\\&context=3) that he had followed Szabo’s social media closely, and sensed strong signals of Szabo’s distaste for Ethereum, and implicitly pointed out his speculation as to why - Szabo’s opposition to The DAO hard fork. He also [noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6fbgdq/nick_szabo_to_vitalik_who_is_we_programmers/digytpr?utm_source=share\\&utm_medium=web2x\\&context=3) that “In a year and a half of being part of this (Ethereum) community, I have never heard Szabo say one positive thing about Ethereum.” This comment was posted in June 2017, which also fits into the transition timeline laid out above.\n\n## Ethereum closing Pandora’s box\n\nIf we say that The DAO hard fork event cracked Pandora’s box of centralization in Ethereum, the proposal of EIP-867 and EIP-999 opened the lid even further, which aroused heated community discussions and Szabo’s criticism. Thankfully, in the end, neither proposal was approved.\n\nOn February 2, 2018, someone from the Ethereum community presented [EIP-867: Standardized Ethereum Recovery Proposals (ERP)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-867), aiming to create a set of evaluation standards for recovering lost funds on Ethereum caused by bugs or mistakes.\n\nThe EIP-867 proposal was triggered by vulnerabilities in Parity multi-signature wallet. In November 2017, a vulnerability in the WalletLibrary contract of the newly deployed multi-signature wallet by the Parity team was accidentally activated by a user. This resulted in the accidental self-destruction of the contract, affecting 587 wallets attached, and a total of 513,774 ethers frozen eternally. In April 2018, the Parity team launched the [EIP-999 proposal](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-999.md) in an attempt to bring the frozen assets back by restoring the code of the WalletLibrary contract.\n\nThe significant damage caused by massive token loss turned some members of the Ethereum community to standardized recovery proposals for problem-solving. Several members, led by Dan Phifer, co-sponsored the EIP-867 proposal.\n\nMany people, in [a discussion about this proposal on Ethereum Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-867-standardized-ethereum-recovery-proposals-erps/139), laid out their objections.\n\nsfultong said: “…accepting/rejecting ERPs is a governance issue, and I don’t think devs should be burdened with making those decisions.”\n\npostables believed that: “This kind of issue should not even be considered as it’s something that can harm the integrity of everyone’s network for the monetary benefit of a very small portion of the user base. The error that resulted in this catastrophic loss of money wasn’t the fault of the protocol or the network rather it was the fault of the developer of the code, but more importantly the fault of everyone who lost money because they didn’t do their own due diligence.”\n\nbwheeler96 spoke out: “I still strongly oppose this EIP. The blockchain is not designed to have a history that can be rewritten.”\n\nConversely, Micah Zoltu, from the standpoint of a supporter, explained that: “The ERP process is a forking process. It is just a recommendation on how people can formalize their requests for a hard fork when it pertains to recovery of lost (not stolen) funds. The ERP process is pretty clear on never being used to take money away from one owner and assigning it to another. It is designed/worded such that it can only take money that is inaccessible by anyone and assign it to the person that should have access to it. This happens in situations where people typo an address, or end up with funds stuck in a smart contract due to a bug. The ERP process is expressly not for something like TheDAO recovery where funds were taken from one party and given to another.”\n\nlocalethereumMichael supposed that such a bad precedent should be prevented: “‘protecting people from shooting themselves in the foot’ will lead to institutionalised theft, especially considering there’s no formalised boundary. EIP-999 might not be considered theft, but each time we accept one of these proposals to essentially undo a transaction, we’re taking another step towards a centralised government that gets to choose which transactions are valid and which are not. Each recovery will set another a precedent just like The DAO fork did (if The DAO fork never happened, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation). Long term, if we accept state changes like this Ethereum will slowly evolve towards a corruptible, tyrannical system over the decades to come. These views were expressed in The DAO fork debate in 2016 and they are still valid today. The fundamental awesome-ness of Ethereum is that code executes exactly as written and there shouldn’t be exceptions to that for people who are exceptionally negligent. This EIP breaks the core functionality of Ethereum.”\n\nIndeed, as the objectors pointed out, **the proposal is a severe violation of immutability of blockchain and the principle of governance minimization, and may even incur legal risks.**\n\nLess than two weeks after EIP-867 was proposed, [Yoichi Hirai, editor of the proposal, resigned from his position](https://twitter.com/pirapira/status/963950687288733697). The reason was that he thought this controversial proposal could violate a Japanese law - “[Unauthorized Creation of Electronic Records:](http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail_main?re=02\\&vm=\\&id=1960#en_pt2ch17at9) the intent to bring about improper administration of the matters of another person”. Before his resignation, he was one of six developers who had the right to update the Github code repository of Ethereum.\n\n[Szabo commented](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/964256077477851137) that EPR “is an abuse of the software upgrade process, an invitation for lawyers to take over, and destructive of social scalability (of Ethereum)”. Broadening the scope of software upgrades should not be a community norm. Special legal and accounting decisions that give permission to balance modification should be forbidden.\n\n[He also claimed that](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/964258743025156098) “ERP is an amateur court that lacks the basic procedural protections one learns in the first year of law school: notice to affected parties, criteria for quality of evidence, etc.” Meanwhile, [he concluded that](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/964259218525011968) ERP can easily become a ripe target for fraudulent claims because it is short of a reliable or secure way to verify impacted Ethereum addresses.\n\nAlso as [CoinDesk reports](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-developer-resigns-as-code-editor-citing-legal-concerns), the main proponent of EIP-867, Dan Philfer, comes from Musiconomi, one of the main victims of the Parity multi-signature wallet incident. The team suffered from the permanent loss of 16,475 ethers gathered through ICO. Dan, as a direct stakeholder in the proposal, has a self-explanatory motive - if EIP-867 is approved, the team will be able to recover their losses.\n\nBut in the end, the quest was failed - both EIP-867 and EIP-999 were rejected. This time, Ethereum closed Pandora’s Box and avoided the mistake of The DAO incident.\n\n## Szabo’s emotional preference and idealism\n\nSzabo’s attitude towards Ethereum was clearly influenced by The DAO hard fork, but it seems that Ethereum’s disapproving EIP-867 and EIP-999 as a gesture of learning from past mistakes did not win him back. So what was Szabo’s view on Ethereum after that?\n\nWe might get a peek from [a conversation](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1184026404733636609) on Twitter between Szabo and Ethereum developer Mark Beylin in October 2019.\n\nSzabo said that Ethereum is like a centralized cult, whose leadership is ignorant of basic values which are at the core of Blockchain and smart contract, such as decentralization and trust minimization.\n\nMark expressed his opinion that Szabo might have been distracted by the few loud voices on Twitter, but in fact the Ethereum community is much wider than that. Many within the community do care about the same ideals Satoshi embedded into the BTC protocol. In terms of blockchain immutability, EIP-999 was vetoed because Ethereum was trying to correct its wrongdoing. This was a key transition point that showed that the community had learned from its past mistake.\n\nSzabo admitted that many people in Ethereum do care about these values, but they are lured by the leadership who pretend to themselves. Since The DAO fiasco, they have practiced trust minimization, purely for pragmatism, not because they have faith in it. Especially Vlad, who almost took on a full-time job preaching against it, and the rest of the leadership tacitly endorsed such views.\n\nWhen Mark asked: “Do you ever worry that your emotional attachments have limited your ability to rationally evaluate these communities and their technologies?”,\n\nSzabo did not go up front, but responded: “Before I figured out in several hard ways what was going on, I was emotionally attached to Ethereum, for silly egotistical reasons: their flattery of smart contracts, their naming a unit of their currency after me, etc.”\n\nIn my opinion, Szabo’s negativity against Ethereum is more or less emotionally biased. **As he admitted that he was leaning towards Ethereum in the early days because of his personal emotions, similarly, he has let his subjective aversion to Vlad get in the way of making an unbiased judgment of the value of the entire Ethereum community.** His blocking Vlad and all his supporters on Twitter due to personal hostility is a case in point. [When Vitalik walked up and said “I like Vlad! Why am I not blocked yet?”, Szabo satisfied his request the instant](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1183636606550339589).\n\nSzabo acknowledges that there are indeed many decentralization believers in the Ethereum community and that Ethereum has been practicing the value of trust minimization after The DAO (as evidenced by the rejection of EIP-867 and EIP-999). However, simply because of the presence of “diehards” like Vlad in the leadership team, Szabo concludes that the so-called decentralization of Ethereum is just a “pretense\", and even overgeneralized that Ethereum has devolved into a “centralized cult”.\n\nIn addition, Szabo, as a strong supporter of trust minimization, appears to be too idealistic, even cynical, on The DAO issue. Admittedly, principles such as decentralization and trust minimization are commendable. When practiced in reality, nevertheless, theories developed in an ivory tower are bound to be challenged. **It is one thing to pick fault with Ethereum from the moral high ground, but another to operate and maintain such a huge decentralized smart contract platform**. Even Bitcoin isn’t perfect; less than two years since its creation, a soft fork had to be implemented to roll back transactions as a result of the [value overflow incident](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident).\n\nDespite a reluctant action, the Ethereum team actually had to implement a hard fork after The DAO attack. At that time, Ethereum was just born less than a year ago, and The DAO project raised almost 14% of the total ethers issued - such a huge amount meant that if The DAO project failed due to the hack, it could be a fatal blow to Ethereum.\n\nIf Szabo put himself into Vitalik’s shoes, what would he have done? Would he stick to the principle of blockchain immutability and watch the smart contract platform he created collapsed into pieces? Or would he set values aside for a while and give way to survival and continuity?\n\nTaking a step back, The DAO hard fork is hardly an absolutely centralized decision. It was a consensus reached among developers, users, miners, and the community. Supporters migrated to the post-fork Ethereum, and those who disavowed could simply stay in Ethereum Classic; everyone gets their own way.\n\nIn this case, is it fair to say that all of Szabo’s accusations against Ethereum are biased? Not necessarily. In my opinion, Szabo, as a contrarian watchdog, has a positive impact on Ethereum.\n\n*   Firstly, an onlooker sees clearly - As an outsider of the Ethereum community, Szabo provides a distinctive perspective to approach the issues.\n*   Secondly, a good medicine tastes bitter - Szabo’s criticism, at times even cynicism, of Ethereum might sound harsh, but some of them really nailed its soft spot.\n\nBoth of the above mentioned are reflected in the discussion of the flaws in the governance mechanism of Ethereum.\n\n## Concerns in the governance of Ethereum\n\nAccording to Szabo, **“**[**the most important and hardest part of trust minimization is governance minimization.**](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1170389161909444609)**”** From this perspective, Vlad’s summary of Szabo’s Law as blockchain governance minimization is proper. Still, **governance minimization is not to abandon governance completely, but to **[**reduce the power and reliance on governance wherever possible**](https://www.fehrsam.xyz/blog/governance-minimization).\n\nThe governance of Ethereum is off-chain, which relies heavily on conference calls held among core developers. Szabo is quite vocal about this. As mentioned earlier, he tweeted that Ethereum leadership has “poor understanding” of governance minimization, and thought that “a governance model that violates immutability” is a “huge problem” for Ethereum.\n\nOn December 1, 2018, Lane Brettig, a key developer of Ethereum, after finishing a regular conference call, [posted a dozen tweets updating relevant progress.](https://twitter.com/lrettig/status/1068546005946310657) He mentioned two new records set in this call: a 2.5-hour length and a 43/60 attendance of key developers worldwide. He also expressed the pity that developers in Asia Pacific could not participate (due to time difference).\n\nWithout reserve, Szabo [replied](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1068956486808698880) that there is a disconnect between key developers and users - the developers have no knowledge of the great diversity of users. Calling it a “community” is a misuse as there is no communication at all. He also gave a prescription for this issue - “Social Scalability”.\n\n[He said](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1068959933897437184): “If you want Ethereum to be a true world computer it must scale socially, i.e. behave in a manner trustworthy to as many diverse users in diverse parts of globe as possible, not merely geographically (just a few dozen English-speaking mutual acquaintances in a handful of cities).”\n\nSo what is social scalability? [According to Szabo](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/827667125556826113), “Social scalability = overcoming shortcomings of human minds & institutions that limit who & how many can successfully participate.”\n\nHe also [suggested a specific measure to improve the scalability of a community](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1068960876416258049): “Each stakeholder who participates in the call decreases all other stakeholders’ voices and thus community – calls and other such communications are unscalable. **The way to scale is to decrease the number of things you need to talk about – decrease the argument surface.**”\n\n[Szabo reckoned that](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1069236671848333313) Ethereum can narrow the argument by strictly prohibiting any potential transaction reversals at the chain level and by foregoing improvements to computational scalability and chain performance, which facilitates overall architectural simplicity and stability, much like removing redundant agenda from the table. Where feasible, Ethereum can move new features and improvements in computational scalability or chain performance from the chain code level on layer 1 to smart contracts or applications on layer 2.\n\n**Reduce the number of issues on the table and touch as little as possible at the chain level - these are concrete approaches to implementing governance minimization advocated by Szabo.**\n\nSzabo is not the only one who picks on the current governance mechanism of Ethereum for not following the principle of governance minimization. For example, the just-implemented [EIP-1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md), an update of Ethereum’s transaction pricing mechanism and modification of Ethereum’s monetary policy, surely of substantial significance, aroused plenty of dissenting opinions within the community. Among them, some argued [that the economic model of EIP-1559 is unconvincing](https://ethfans.org/zengmi/articles/38066). Sadly, though the issues were put forward, Ethereum Foundation neither bothered to pay much attention and start any conversation nor for one second hesitated about having a change of heart. [Opponents thus complained](https://www.chainnews.com/articles/595733283015.htm) that the Ethereum Foundation is headstrong and unrestrained, and never seems to ponder whether their power should be limited in any way. Any proposal led by the Foundation that was technically feasible was approved. This has been especially true in recent years, with underlying design moved and monetary policy changed, given absolutely no consideration of governance minimization.\n\nIn his article [*Governance Minimization*](https://www.fehrsam.xyz/blog/governance-minimization), Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of leading crypto investment fund Paradigm, points out **the importance of governance minimization** - “**it supports the primary value proposition of protocols: credible neutrality**”, **a set of mechanisms built on which is instinctively fair, with no favorites or discrimination against any particular groups.** The level of credible neutrality of a protocol tends to be greatly enhanced by minimal governance.\n\nUnfortunately, the credible neutrality of the Ethereum governance mechanism is being challenged. The Foundation is entitled to raising proposals, with each of them easily endorsed and approved. No voice of opposition can shout louder. Other community members involved in Ethereum governance are ignored. The scale of credible neutrality was heavily tilted.\n\nWhen credible neutrality is eroded, more and more issues would be put on the table, leading certain people to contemplate making changes to the code at the chain level. This will further introduce the discussion of modifying underlying protocols, which makes governance minimization out of place. It seems that the Ethereum leadership is clear about this - It was [Vitalik’s article](https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/) that Fred cited to explain the concept of credible neutrality. That said, for some reason, they seem to be going in the opposite direction.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe main drive that turned Nick Szabo’s attitude towards Ethereum from being supportive to objective is unclear. It can be inferred from his open criticism of Ethereum, however, that some of their practices violated the core concept he has always upheld and promoted - trust minimization. Among these, The DAO hard fork in 2016 was the most hurtful. Although Ethereum has since learned its lesson and extinguished any actions at the risk of undermining blockchain immutability, the broken trust was never rebuilt.\n\nIn my opinion, Szabo’s negativity towards Ethereum is derived from his ideal of decentralization, more or less swayed by subjective emotions. Nonetheless, it is undeniable that the governance mechanism of Ethereum is problematic and lacks consideration of governance minimization. Szabo’s criticism and suggestions on this point are meaningful, which deserve the deliberation of every single member of the community who is involved in its governance.\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nMy sincere appreciation goes to Ajian and Yao Xiang for their valuable input on this article, Raphina for her generous assistance in data collection and timeline mapping, and Kandace for translation.\n\n### DISCLAIMER\n\nThis work was a research achievement of Primitives Lane and was funded by Primitives Lane.

By doing this light exploration, we can start to build increasing layers of understanding and context around the world we are living in, and proceed from there to ask questions about how we can create this new world.\n\nSound cool ?\n\nNice. Let’s get into it.\n\n**What is Web 1 ?**\n\nWeb 1 refers to the earliest stages of the internet, as it was configured from the 1980s through to the early 2000s. In that era, there were only a few creators on the internet. Most users on the web were simply consumers of content. The most common form of content was typically personal web pages, which were mostly static and hosted on free web hosting services. This configuration of the internet was decentralised. It was built upon a series of open protocols that anyone could create directly on top of. For example, there was the HTTP protocol to create websites, the SMS protocol to create messages, the FTP protocol for file transfers and the SMTP protocol to send emails. These protocols essentially acted as a sediment layer. They were agreed upon, not subject to change, and as a result people could build websites on top of these protocols without fearing whether some intermediary would “change the rules of the game”.\n\nThis was all good. People had a sense of security, privacy and excitement about building projects online. There was a direct relationship with the consumer. But the technology was clunky in a few pretty important ways.\n\n1. **Stateless:** Web 1 protocols were stateless. What this means is that websites essentially had no “memory”. They did not capture user data. This meant that website owners had no idea if a user had visited a site before, and so they couldn’t tailor experiences accordingly. This led to a pretty rubbish user experience for most websites - with a lot of useless information of people. \n \n2. **Too technical:** To build a presence on Web 1, users had to be technical. They had to understand how SMTP, SMS, HTTP etc. all worked in order to build out services we take for granted now such as emails, messaging and building websites. This barrier to entry meant that every day people weren’t able to really participate in the internet as creators, and this wasn’t great. \n \n3. **Limited protocols:** Web 1 didn’t have standard protocols for many the things that power the internet today, like payments, search, apps, social media, commerce, credit and more. This meant that the use case of the internet was pretty limited, and did not touch the needs of every day people. \n \n4. **No advertising / monetisation:** In Web 1, websites were not able to show adverts while \"surfing on the web”. There really was no real monetisation mechanism that would help builders capture the value they generated. Protocols had no means of monetisation. If they did, then **[Tim Berners Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee)** would have made a lot more money. \n \n\nIn summary, Web 1 showed a lot of promise. But it had some serious gaps which needed to be filled. Some of these limitations ushered in the era that we have collectively grown up in, which is referred to as Web 2.\n\n**What is Web 2 ?**\n\nWeb 2 refers to the version of the internet that we know and see today. It’s the internet of Facebook, of YouTube, of Google. It’s an internet dominated by companies that provide services in exchange for user’s personal data. This was the era when software developers recognised the limitations of web 1, built products to fill them in, and made sure the capture the value in the process. Once the technology required to capture State (cookies) was invented, companies set out to aggregate it by building buckets too attract mountains of user data. Companies like Facebook made it so that anyone could participate and build a presence on the platform, and they wrapped existing products in frictionless user interfaces that created products where no protocols existed or were too technical.\n\nThis was really a great period of time. It democratised the ability for many people to participate on the internet. For example rather than my needing to understand SMTP to create my own email client, I could use services like Gmail or MailChimp. Rather than needing to understand the fundamentals of SMS to create instant messaging, I could use services like Twitter to communicate, and also to be discovered. These are all desirable and valuable outputs.\n\nAs a general outline of the typical web 2 model, a company would rely on user participation to create fresh content, and profile data to be sold to third parties for marketing purposes. The internet in this configuration is essentially a giant app store, dominated by centralised apps from Google, Facebook and Amazon, where everyone is trying to build an audience, collect data, and subsequently monetise that data through targeted advertising. The centralisation of this data, and and use of this data without the user’s meaningful consent, is therefore built into that web 2 business model.\n\nThe flip side of that economic model is SAAS or subscription based. In this model there is a strong polarisation between the consumer and the producer, where the exchange is such that the producer creates the service and the consumer receives it in exchange for a fee. While this avoided some of the privacy challenges implicit in the advertising model, it does not allow for the participatory and open source nature that the internet is so naturally suited to empower.\n\nAnd still, more challenges remain. For instance Twitter could shut down a user’s account whenever it wants to. And that user’s followers would be scrubbed out with it, as we’ve seen on a few occasions already. In another example, Facebook allowed brands and publishers to build up audiences on a seemingly free platform, and then they changed the rules and forced them to pay to reach their own audiences. All of these issues point towards a different solution, which we call web 3.\n\n**So what is Web 3?**\n\nAs we mentioned a little further up, the early internet thrived because of native internet protocols that we use daily. This includes things like https, ftp, tcp and ssh. One of the main reasons that these protocols have been so successful is that they were widely adopted and not subject to change. The rules of the game could not change at the will of any specific CEO or group of investors.\n\nUntil recently, there were two pieces of functionality that made web 2 stand out from web 1, even with those decentralised protocols. The first is payments, and the second is state. Blockchain technology enables both of these things because it opens up the path to programmable money and state (memory) without the need of a centralised server, bank or any intermediary at all !\n\nThe result is that Web 3 and blockchains are able to bring about entirely new business models only made possible by tokenisation and crypto-economic protocols. To see early examples of this check out [PartyDAO](https://party.mirror.xyz) and [Compound](https://compound.finance). In this model, creators monetise through the issuance of social tokens or NFTs, rather than through advertising.\n\nWhat this means is that money and influence will shift from the people who aggregate state, to the people who create and consume. It will cut out the middle man in a disruptive manner, and it will attach each user’s data and money directly to them. It will be underpinned by a public record that they own, which they can take with them and profit off wherever they go on the web.\n\nStill, while all of this makes sense and is exciting on paper. Web 3 is still a long way from mass adoption. Interfaces are often still clunky and unapproachable to those who aren’t technical. This is why companies like CoinBase and OpenSea have become so valuable so quickly, and have managed to do so without any paid advertising. We need more projects with simple interfaces. We need more projects that enable people to engage with crypto in an intuitive way. We need more projects that empower people to take their fates into their own hands. \n  \n It’s time to build them !", "timestamp": 1635949681, "digest": "CWgaNyAwqhqip3N4c5yAs1tkWdUgf7pazWyk8fFfHt4", "contributor": "0xa79A065efEC011dAc7ecDBD1E9919A9a3a97f2D1"}

You’ll get smarter and laugh every week 🤓\n\n🎧\\* To get this essay straight in your ears: listen on **[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5Fa6OZuYALrMGVBXAR7kYy)**\\*\n\nStock market, I need you to understand…it’s not you…it’s me.\n\n**I have increased my personal allocation to crypto.**\n\nIf you know me you know I am a strong advocate for investing in the stock market. That’s not changing.\n\nHowever, it is very clear that more revenue-generating use-cases and businesses are being built on blockchains. I believe this is going to drive more adoption, more public tech companies to get involved, better user experiences/user interfaces, better security, and more innovation in the space.\n\nThis marks the start of my journey deeper into crypto. I’m a beginner in every sense of the word which is why I think it’s important for me to document my journey as I learn. I still have an outsider’s perspective and have not built up any biases in the space which I think will help me keep an open mind (we’ll see).\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2de3c4d0-6f63-47e5-a684-e4518e9a709a_1280x720.png)\n\nI have no idea which cryptocurrencies will do well and none of this is a recommendation. No one should have any confidence in the level of research I’ve done into these because I consider myself an absolute beginner. These opinions are mine and mine only. **This is not financial advice.**\n\n**Disclosure:** As of this writing, I personally own Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cosmos (ATOM), Wrapped Luna (WLUNA) which represents Terra (LUNA), Polygon (MATIC), Polymath (POLY), Assemble Protocol (ASM), Olympus (OHM), and THORChain (RUNE).\n\n**My current assumptions:**\n\n* Crypto and Blockchain technology are here to stay\n* Everyone investing in the stock market should dedicate time to crypto\n* Everyone investing in crypto should dedicate time to the stock market\n* Crypto when combined into one single “market” has more upside than the S&P500 or the “stock market” over the next 10 years\n* Crypto has more risk than the stock market over the next 10 years. That’s how risk works\n* There are individual stocks (companies) that will significantly outperform the stock market and most cryptocurrencies over the next 10 years\n* There are individual cryptocurrencies that will significantly outperform the crypto “market” and most individual stocks over the next 10 years\n* I am far more likely to get scammed in crypto (invest in a crypto that goes to 0, lose your crypto wallet and any funds inside permanently) than in any individual stock (excluding penny stocks). This is because stocks are heavily regulated\n* Regulation will be a good thing for legitimate cryptocurrencies, blockchains, and crypto investors\n* It’s impossible to establish any credible price targets for any cryptocurrencies because the asset class is too new and there is no industry standard\n* Some people will be “right” and become very rich off crypto but that doesn’t mean their process for establishing price targets and/or allocating capital was right. It just means the outcome worked out in their favor\n* I will be extremely careful “following” anyone’s research in crypto because it’s impossible to know what their incentives actually are (what crypto do they own, what protocol are they being paid by to promote?)\n* The same is true in stocks with the exception of fund managers who have to disclose their holdings\n* The number of people developing things and using crypto will be significantly higher in 5, 10, and 15 years than today\n* There is tremendous upside in crypto even if Bitcoin doesn’t become the global reserve currency, the U.S. dollar doesn’t collapse, and civilization as we know it doesn’t cease to exist\n* I don’t see any indication that these doomsday scenarios that many love to push will happen. If they do, please continue subscribing to my newsletter that I’ll write by hand from an underground bunker somewhere\n* I have limited time to spend on this stuff so I’m going to own what I believe are the core cryptocurrencies that will benefit from adoption, dollar cost average into them monthly, keep my allocation at a level that I’m comfortable with 50%+ losses\n* Day trading crypto and/or stocks is a fantastic way to lose money and I have 0 interest in doing that\n* Many of the qualities that make great stock market investors will translate directly to crypto. A longer time horizon, proper risk management, and a process-driven approach are true edges\n* Balance is important. Remember to take care of your health, your family, and other priorities\n\n### Cryptocurrency Market Cap vs Global Equity Market Cap\n\nI’m going to define most of the crypto terminology I use, but [here’s a great glossary of terms for crypto newbies from Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1050329/a-basic-glossary-of-terms-for-crypto-newbies).\n\nAccording to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies is $2.6 trillion, there are currently 13,164 cryptocurrencies and 422 exchanges. In October 2020, the total market cap was $400 billion.\\*\\* The global market cap of cryptocurrencies has grown by $2.2 trillion or 6.5x over the last year.\\*\\*\n\nFor context, the [total value of the U.S. equity market is](https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/) $48.5 trillion, up 20% from $40.7 trillion at the end of 2020. **The U.S. stock market has grown by $7.8 trillion since the end of 2020.**\n\nGlobal equity market capitalization [increased by roughly $20 trillion in 2020](https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/fact-book/) ending the year at $105.8 trillion up 18% year-over-year.\n\nOn one hand, the 6.5x growth in the cryptocurrency market over the last year seems absolutely absurd. On the other hand, it represents 2.5% of the global equity markets\n\nCrypto’s growth of $2.2 trillion over the last year was roughly 10% of the growth of global equities. Given the difference in current market size, total addressable markets, and growth rates the $2.2 trillion doesn’t seem as excessive.\n\nDo I think crypto is going to overtake the global equity markets? No.\n\nBut when I think about it as part of a broader investment portfolio, It’s easy to imagine crypto representing 5% - 10% of a portfolio. There are a lot of regulatory and technological barriers to many global investors owning crypto in their portfolios but I think those barriers will go away over time. That arguably makes crypto more interesting now because it’s a headwind that I believe will go away.\n\nThe next logical question is whether or not the crypto market is overvalued. My answer is that over the short term, I have no clue. But just like in the stock market, assets are valued based on their potential for future growth.\n\nI’m comfortable with the idea that the crypto markets have the potential for higher growth rates ahead compared to global equities. There are a lot of global stock markets I’d never even consider investing in.\n\nIt makes sense to me that crypto deserves a “premium” compared to the global equity markets because of the upside potential. However, I could also see the crypto market shrinking by 50% overnight.\n\nAt this point, I’m looking at investing in crypto as a call option (high risk, but high potential return) on more people and businesses being interested in it in the future.\n\nSome crypto-enthusiasts make an argument that crypto and specifically Bitcoin and/or Ether are sound money. Sound money basically means a currency that can be expected to be stable enough to be a “store of value”.\n\nFrom my limited knowledge, no crypto is anywhere close to being sound money right now. The prices are too volatile. Many will argue, that they are a store of value because there’s a limited supply, they’re decentralized, etc so in their opinion, the value will go up exponentially, and eventually the price will stabilize. Then they will be sound money and a store of value.\n\nI believe this is a potential outcome. But probably 20+ years in the future. In my opinion, this is a good thing because it means crypto can continue increasing in value before stabilizing.\n\nThe story of crypto thus far is one of mostly dominance by Bitcoin and Ether, with other assets only gaining in popularity in the last few years.\n\n### Bitcoin Dominance Chart\n\nThe chart below from CoinMarketCap shows the percentage of total crypto market cap for the 10 largest cryptoassets.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb38c40e-fa6b-403e-9aa7-859f8eb49d11_1371x643.png)\n\nIn February 2017, Bitcoin and Ethereum made up 91% of all cryptoassets with no other asset representing over 1%.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f47bb38-7db1-480e-a270-f8755573ab78_229x215.png)\n\nAs of October 2021, Bitcoin represents 45.5%, Ethereum represents 19%, “Others” represent 18%, and 8 other assets represent at least 1%. Nine cryptoassets represent 82% of the total crypto market cap or roughly $2.13 trillion.\n\nBitcoin represents a market cap of $1.17 trillion and Ethereum represents $500 billion.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fe6f73e-9bfb-40c1-82e9-a7a12206d879_229x215.png)\n\nIn order for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies to grow their market capitalizations and sustain them over the long term, they have to drive comparable economic value as compared to corporations with similar market capitalizations.\n\nThat statement could be completely wrong, but it’s my current view. I’ve heard some people say they value everything in Bitcoin and not the U.S. dollar.\n\nI’m nowhere close to arriving at that conclusion. I don’t think it’s intellectually honest to believe that at this time. You can’t sustain your livelihood/life (buy food, utilities, medical, etc) without using the dollar or your local currency. Until you can, it’s unrealistic to value everything in Bitcoin.\n\n### The Economic Value of Crypto\n\nWhat is the total economic value of these cryptocurrencies and do they deserve their current valuations? I have no idea.\n\n***That will be the main question I try to answer as I dive deeper into crypto and I’ll share my learnings along the way. If anyone has good data or resources on this please share in the comments, or hit reply and email me directly!***\n\n[Leave a comment](https://austin.substack.com/p/my-crypto-confession-part-1/comments)\n\nI’m new at this but here’s my current view on how blockchains can provide economic value and in turn, drive certain cryptocurrencies higher over time.\n\n*Blockchain technology is a crowd-sourced and verified database. However, instead of being sold and managed by a company like Microsoft or MongoDatabase, users get access to its features by purchasing one of the digital assets (cryptocurrencies) that the database’s code understands.*\n\nOkay, thanks Austin, you just confirmed my view that crypto is made up and has no value.\n\n*Not so fast…*\n\nWhy is Windows, or iOS, or Mayonaise for that matter valuable? They’re valuable because Windows and iOS provide an interface that millions of people and businesses have agreed to use and therefore derive value from. Mayonaise is just disgusting.\n\nSimilar to operating systems or any other software, blockchains will drive economic value if more people believe in them and decide to build revenue-generating use cases and business on them.\n\nThis is only the very beginning of the discussion I want to have about crypto. It is left to be decided what currency people will ultimately care about that revenue being generated in. Right now, anyone who makes money in crypto can’t cover the essentials of living without transferring it to a fiat currency.\n\nWill that change in the future? possibly. But I’ll leave it here for essay #1\n\n### Questions I have that I’ll write about in the future\n\n* What is the total economic value of these cryptocurrencies and do they deserve their current valuations?\n* What is the ownership structure of all of the mined Bitcoin? Who owns them? Are there just a few “whales” who own most of the value and can therefore undermine the security and future of Bitcoin?\n* What even happens when you purchase crypto on an exchange like Coinbase?\n* Why is the wallet experience so horrible right now and when will that improve?\n\n<!---->\n\n* Is the explosion in activity on Ethereum from NFTs a potential risk to Ethereum’s future because it caused gas prices to go so high? Does this concern open up opportunities for other alternative layer 1 blockchains? If so then what does that say about the moat or defensibility of blockchains and what does that mean for their long-term value in USD?\n* What are all of these new cryptos like Solana, and others? How do we know if something is a total scam?\n\nThis newsletter is not only going to focus on crypto. Most of my assets and interest is currently tied to the stock market so you’ll still get updates about stocks and other finance-related topics.\n\nI’m trying to make this newsletter sustainable for myself and informative for you as a reader. We’re at a turning point in history where it’s never been easier to be an investor. I want to help spread financial literacy and awareness in a thoughtful way which is how I’ll use this platform.\n\nI hope you join me on the ride.\n\n### Help me get smarter about crypto\n\n* **Hit the heart at the top of this page, subscribe for free, and share with your friends.

It is not uncommon for this to lead to an infection of the organism and even to organ-damaging dysfunction. A unique interaction potential. In order to develop this function, the evolutionary development of viruses, which already started from the evolution of metabolism-based microorganisms, certainly plays a decisive role. What other particle that works so efficiently uses a comparably relevant functionality as a method? \n  \n In the ruse of disguising itself as the body's own particle, which enters the human cell's own production sites and subsequently uses them for its own replication without being noticed, is a highly efficient and dangerous strategy. \n  \n This characteristic creates a global need to think, analyse and produce new modules and possibilities to ensure the health of the earth's population. In the best case, to protect preventively. \n  \n In 2021, the German Centre for Vaccine Research still estimates that it will take 10 years to produce a validated drug or a serum that can be injected into humans as a vaccine with acceptable side effects. \n  \n The Anthropocene shows a further progressive takeover of untouched fauna and flora. Original habitats that have not yet been touched by humans, with their microbiological natural diversity, are being incorporated automatically, so to speak, through urban expansion. It is obvious that the list of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), which was compiled in the 1970s, will be expanded in the future by a large number of as yet unknown viruses. \n  \n Technological developments enable us to understand the sequencing of DNA. From this, relevant RNA structures can be extracted. These can be understood in relation to their function: used, produced, specially designed and subsequently transcribed. As highly specialised parts, these genome sequences offer the initiation of specific molecular genetic production of necessary proteins in cells, which can be translated again by the cell's own ribosomes into process-triggering proteins. These proteins are, for example, fundamentally responsible for triggering a necessary preventive immune response of the body in critial situation even years later. \n  \n Research and science, as demonstrated in 2020 by the SarsCov-2 virus pandemic, are capable of equipping humans with a preventive immunising immune response through biotechnologically developed seras in the shortest possible time, testing them and making them available in high quantities after testing. To achieve this, the development of all highly specialised individual processes requires intensive research, detailed precision, high technology, complex production facilities, meticulous personalisation of methodology, lengthy evaluation as well as time for explicit testing of efficacy. Not to mention the effort of adapting different serums for immune system function to individual classes of viruses and their constant natural mutation.  \n  \n What if we could develop a digital simulation that would be able to correlate ecological evolution/mutation of our natural habitat and human anatomical evolution/mutation to predict protein diversity by simulating RNA, including change and expansion of the organism's overall immune composition, in evolution and interrelationship? How would it be if information for future viruses could be distilled from this and at the same time already provided with a blueprint for immunisation through a serum vaccine?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s8R6X75QkaQiXYO8UjVUP.jpg?height=1920&width=1920)\n\nThe METAPOLYCISTRONICS (MPC) is a system with several coupled computational simulations, which work in mutual alignment of their results. A immunisation via intelligent genome engineering. The MPC develops solution model data, such as foreseeable constellations of possible virus genomes with directly associated solution approaches from mRNA classifications. \n  \n A first model module of the active continuous digital simulation classifies detailed current proteins of the human immune system as a basic catalogue. As an extension, new possible proteins and DNA changes, which can be predicted in ecological as well as anatomical evolution and their mutual condition, are simulated, so to speak, in options and variations computationally chaotically modelled. \n  \n Another model module uses current and known viral genome structures from their RNA or DNA and evolutionises/mutates them. In the process, the model transcribes not yet known mRNA parts that contain an above-average change compared to the known sequences of the genetic information and makes these available to the overall system in a prioritisation. \n  \n The coupling of the two models creates an overall simulation that is constantly synchronised with each other. Representable, visualisable potential new virus classifications with directly related selection of relevant mRNA sequences of the new virus speculations can be recognised and output preventively.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QvQ9Y8WiWLABckXuiZ4c5.jpg?height=7926&width=7926)\n\nFrom the generated data results, MPC can be used to assemble a polychronistic sequence guide for multidimensional multi-mRNA as the basis of a combination vaccine to be produced. This vaccine not only responds to current facts of an upcoming new viral pandemic, but also covers evolutionary preventive immunisation evolutions with a thereby initiated protein diversity in the human body. \n  \n An MPC serum with its polychronistic messenger-RNA is able to initiate and output diverse different proteins through its calculated intelligent structure and sequence of nucleotide sequences in the human cell in order to preventively and actively train the immune system on an ongoing basis.  \n  \n The serum can be available and administered to patients in an annual subscription. Personalisation of personal immune data can be included in the MPC. \n  \n The natural evolution of the anatomical functionality of the immune system is thus an essential part of the overall system and is actively included in the simulation.

Um diese Funktion zu entwickeln spielt sicherlich die evolutionäre Entwicklung der Viren, welche schon von der Evolution der stoffwechselbasierten Mikroorganismen begann, eine ausschlaggebende Rolle. Welches andere so effizient arbeitende Teilchen nutzt eine vergleichbar relevante Funktionalität als Methode.\n\nIn der List, sich als körpereigenes Modul zu verschleiern, welches die menschlich zelleigenen Produktionsstätten betritt und diese anschließend für die eigene Replikation unbemerkt nutzt, ist eine hocheffiziente und gefährliche Strategie.\n\nAus dieser Eigenschaft entsteht eine globale Notwendigkeit, neue Module und Möglichkeiten zu denken, zu analysieren und herzustellen, um die Gesundheit der Erdbevölkerung zu gewährleisten.

Daraus lassen sich relevante RNA Strukturen herauslösen. Diese können im Bezug zu ihrer Funktion verstanden, genutzt, hergestellt, eigens gestaltet wie anschliessend transkribiert werden. Als hoch spezialisierte Anteile bieten diese Genomsequenzen in Zellen die Initiation spezifischer molekulargenetischer Produktion von notwendigen Proteinen, welche durch die zelleigenen Ribosomen wieder in prozessauslösende Proteine übersetzt werden können.

Dazu benötigt die Entwicklung aller hoch spezialisierten einzelnen Vorgänge intensive Forschung, detailgenaue Präzision, Hochtechnologie, komplexe Produktionsstätten, minutiöse Personalisierung der Methodik, langwierige Evaluation wie Zeit zur expliziten Prüfung der Wirksamkeit. Ganz abgesehen des Aufwandes der Anpassung verschiedener Seras für die Funktion des Immunsystems auf einzelne Klassen von Viren und deren ständige natürliche Mutation.\n\nWie wäre es, wenn wir eine digitale Simulation entwickeln, welche in der Lage wäre, ökologische Evolution/Mutation unseres natürlichen Lebensraumes und der anatomischen Evolution/Mutation des Menschen in Bezug zu setzten, um eine Proteindiversität, auch Veränderung und Erweiterung der gesamten Immunzusammensetzung des Organismus, in Entwicklung und wechselseitiger Beziehung vorherzusagen? Wie wäre es wenn daraus Informationen für zukünftige Viren destilliert und gleichzeitig schon mit einem Bauplan für die Immunisierung durch einen Serumimpfstoff bereitstellt werden würden?\n\nDas METAPOLYCISTRONICS (MPC) ist ein System mit mehreren gekoppelten computergestützten Softwaresimulationen, welche in gegenseitigem Abgleich ihrer Ergebnisse funktioniert. Das MPC entwickelt Lösungsmodelle, wie vorherzusehende Konstellationen von möglich auftretenden Virusgenomen mit dazu direkt zugeordneten Lösungsansätzen aus mRNA Klassifikationen.\n\nEin erstes Modellmodul der aktiven immer fortlaufenden digitalen Simulation klassifiziert Details, wie aktuelle Proteinkataloge des humanen Immunsystems als Basiskatalog. Als Erweiterung werden neue mögliche Proteine und DNA Veränderungen, welche sich in der ökologischen wie anatomischen Evolution und deren gegenseitige Bedingung vermuten, sozusagen simuliert, in Optionen und Variationen rechnerisch chaotisch modelliert.\n\nEin weiteres Modellmodul nutzt aktuelle wie bekannte virale Genomstrukturen aus deren RNA beziehungsweise DNA und evolutioniert beziehungsweise mutiert diese. Im Vorgang transkribiert das Modell noch nicht bekannte mRNA Anteile, welche eine überdurchschnittliche Veränderung gegenüber den bekannten Sequenzen der Erbgutinformation enthalten, und stellt diese in einer Priorisierung dem Gesamtsystem zur Verfügung.\n\nDie Koppelung beider Modelle erzeugt eine sich ständig gegenseitig abgleichende Gesamtsimulation. Darstellbare, visualisierbare potenzielle neue Virusklassifikationen mit direkt bezogener Selektion relevanter mRNA Sequenzen der neuen Virusspekulationen sind präventiv zu erkennen und auszugeben.\n\nAus den erzeugten Datenergebnissen kann MPC dazu genutzt werden eine polychronistische Sequenzanleitung für mehrdimensionale Multi-mRNA als Basis eines herzustellenden Kombinationsimpfstoffs zusammensetzten. Dieser Impfstoff reagiert nicht nur auf aktuelle Fakten einer anstehenden neuen Viruspandemie, sondern deckt evolutionsbedingte präventive Immunisierungsevolutionen mit einer dadurch initiierten Proteindiversität im menschlichen Körper ab.\n\nEin MPC-Serum ist mit seiner multivariablen MessengerRNA in der Lage, durch seine berechnete intelligente Struktur und Abfolge der Nukleotidsequenzen in der menschlichen Zelle diverse unterschiedliche Proteine zu initiieren und auszugeben, um präventiv und aktiv das Immunsystem fortlaufend zu schulen. Das Serum kann in einem Jahresabonnement Patienten zur Verfügung stehen und verabreicht werden. Eine Personalisierung persönlicher Immundaten kann in das MPC einbezogen werden.\n\nDie natürliche Evolution der anatomischen Funktionalität des Immunsystems ist damit essenzieller Teil des Gesamtsystems und ist in die Simulation aktiv mit einbezogen.

The globally widespread mycelium, as the mostly invisible network of the fungus, consists of widely branched single-row thread-like cells. The outer membranes of these channel-like, widely branching hyphae (cylindrical tube systems) can coordinate the transport of various mineral nutrients such as phosphorus or nitrogen, and exchange them as needed in a symbiotic partnership with plants at an explicit position for their sugars produced by photosynthesis. This naturally controlled process provides fascinating methods of a biochemically coordinated system of demand and demand correlation. A mycelial network thus serves, for example, trees as a useful supplier of water and minerals. \n \nIn natural areas, mycelia can reach an extent of more than one square kilometre. Due to the ever-structuring and demand-oriented newly modulated hyphal expansions, they can theoretically exist for an unlimited lifetime. In forests, collectives are formed from various individual mycelia, which exchange biologically relevant information about water scarcity, pest infestation and special circumstances with their symbiosis partners and synchronise each other biochemically. They can store situations in their growth pattern, so to speak. Trees, for example, use this network for an intelligent exchange of information, a form of communication with other members of their species.\nOur humanly developed, computer-assisted, synthetically generated information exchange via data networks, as well as long-term and short-term data storage, involves a problem: the finiteness of physical storage media and components. Technologies such as solid-state drives, HDDs and analogue data storage such as data lines are subject to physical finiteness due to wear and tear. \n \nQuestions arise as to how relevant data can be stored permanently for thousands of years and our future - how it can be preserved. Methods such as temporary engraving by optoelectronic processes (laser writing) in three-dimensional quartz glass bodies are being investigated both scientifically and physically. \n \nSynthetic materials, however, are cost-effective in the ever-advancing Big Data dimension. The combination of our future data archives and storage thus requires an adaptation of the requirements of future data processing.\n\n![UTH.17.1 – Hyphed 500TB standard product study ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RS2BcL-Ui7fZ4CynQu0rF.png?height=1804&width=1804)\n\nHow about we develop a symbiotic interface globally existing mycelial network of fungal genera and translate it into a product family for data storage? A data repository through a symbiosis of data, plant and mycelium? \n \nThe 500 TB Hyphed Standard is a handy ceramic porous cylinder on whose surface there are organic cells connected to a control unit and vapour-deposited spores of a fungus. The interior is partially hollow and provides space for the insertion of the roots of a young plant.\n\nAs the root system grows, the Hyphed integrates directly in physical symbiosis. The cells of the Hyphed are connected to a control unit that functions as a data interface. The roots, in combination with the symbiotic mycelium (mycorrhizal fungi), provide sugars and minerals that the Hyphed needs to function.\n\nTo operate the synthetic control unit, the Hyphed has an enrichment of the bacterium Rhodoferax ferrireducens in closed areas of the product body, which provides electrical current for the control unit from a portion of the sugar. Once the Hyphed is transplanted, it can be operated after two to three weeks of mycelium growth. The data writing process takes place in the cells on the surface of the Hyphed. In the process, cells take up phosphorus or nitrogen through the adjacent hyphae of the mycelium.\n\n![UTH.17.2 – Hyphed 500TB standard mycelium network installed study ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/F4bcQqfpMAyKNPmYq7zVH.png?height=1804&width=1804)\n\nThe Hyphed provides three types of cells. A nitrogen-filled cell, a phosphorus-filled cell and a mixed cell. The cell completely filled with nitrogen is interpreted as digital information 1 and the cell is filled with phosphorus with digital information 0. Cells that allow a ratio concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus also store ratios simultaneously, so to speak. Thus, storage states are also conceivable in an extended form. \n \nIf a cell is written to, it stops dispensing sugar and seals the opening to the mycelium. If the cell is reset or deleted, it releases the contained mineral substance again by an impulse given by the control unit to its adjacent hypha of the mycelium. A write or delete process thus only works through an interaction with the fungal mycelium itself.\nThe Hyphed product family consists of the Standard with 500 TB (young plant), the Module with 2000 TB (perennial tree plant), and the Enterprise (forest plot or rental of a planted adult forest) with scalable zettabytes. The Enterprise solution can also be integrated or applied to existing forests.\n\n![UTH.17.3 – Hyphed hyphenlink visualisation study](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Clg2OMqdE5TJJXk5mBHLj.png?height=1804&width=1804)\n\nThe optional Hyphed-Commute module can be added to any product and offers a so-called Hyphenlink. This makes the exchange of information via the so-called \"World Wide Hyphed Network\" conceivable. Signals are thus transmitted to other Hyphed products via their mycelial network without affecting the function and form of the natural hyphae. An alternative ecologically natural symbiotic form of information communication. \n  \n --- \n  \n Neben unserem aktuellen synthetischen Informations- und Kommunikationssystem mit seinen nach Moore‘s Gesetz exponentiell anwachsenden Datenmengen existiert ein weiteres natürliches Netzwerk. Die weltweit verbreiteten Myzele, als meist unsichtbare Geflecht des Pilzes, besteht aus weit verzweigten einreihigen fadenförmigen Zellen. Die Außenmembranen dieser kanalartigen sich weit verzweigenden Hyphen (zylindrischen Rohrsystemen) sind in der Lage den Transport verschiedenster Mineralstoffe wie Phosphor oder Stickstoff zu koordinieren, und nach Bedarf in einer symbiotischen Partnerschaft mit Pflanzen an expliziter Position gegen deren durch Fotosynthese hergestellten Zucker auszutauschen. Dieser natürlich gesteuerte Prozess bietet faszinierende Methoden eines biochemisch koordinierten Systems der Bedarfs- und der Nachfragekorrelation. Ein Myzelnetzwerk dient somit zum Beispiel Bäumen als nützlicher Wasser und Mineralstofflieferant. \n\nMyzele sind in natürlichen Gebieten in der Lage eine Ausdehnung von über einem Quadratkilometer zu erreichen. Durch die sich immer weiter strukturieren und bedarfsorientierten neu modulierten Hyphenausdehnungen können sie theoretisch für eine unbegrenzte Lebenszeit existieren. In Wäldern bilden sich Kollektive aus verschiedenen Einzelmyzelen, welche biologisch relevante Informationen von Wasserknappheit, Schädlingsbefall und besonderen Umständen an ihre Symbiosepartner austauschen und gegenseitig biochemisch synchronisieren. Sie sind in der Lage Situationen sozusagen in ihrem Wachstumsmuster abzuspeichern. Dieses Netzwerk nutzen zum Beispiel Bäume für einen intelligenten Informationsaustausch, einer Form der Kommunikation mit anderen Artgenossen.\n\nUnser menschlich entwickelter, computergestützter synthetisch erzeugter Informationsaustausch über Datennetzwerke, sowie die Langzeit wie Kurzzeit-Datenspeicherung, beinhaltet auf lange Sicht eine Problematik: die Endlichkeit physikalischer Speichermedien und Bauteile. Technologien wie Solid State Drives, HDDs und analoger Datenspeicher wie Datenleitungen unterliegen einer physikalischen Endlichkeit durch Abnutzung und Verschleiß.\n\nEs stellen sich Fragen wie relevante Daten beständig für tausende von Jahren und unsere Zukunft abzuspeichern sind – zu konservieren sind. Methoden, wie die temporäre Gravur durch optoelektronischen Verfahren (Laserschreibvorgänge) in  dreidimensionale Quarzglaskörper werden wissenschaftlich wie physikalisch untersucht.\n\nSynthetische Materialien sind jedoch in der immer wieder fortschreitenden Big-Data Dimension kosteneffizient. Die Kombination unserer zukünftigen Datenarchive und Speicher erfordert damit eine Anpassung der Anforderungen zukünftiger Datenverarbeitung.\n\nWie wäre es, wenn wir eine symbiotische Schnittstelle weltweit existierenden Myzeliennetzwerk der Pilzgattungen entwickeln und in eine Produktfamilie für die Datenablage übersetzten? Ein Datenspeicher durch eine Symbiose von Daten, Pflanze und Myzel?\n\nDas 500 TB Hyphed Standard ist ein handlich keramischer poröser Zylinder auf dessen Oberfläche sich mit einer Steuereinheit verbundenen organischen Zellen und aufgedampften Sporen eines Pilzes befinden. Der Innenbereich ist teilweise hohl und bietet Platz für das Einsetzen der Wurzeln einer Jungpflanze. \n\nWächst das Wurzelwerk integriert sich das Hyphed in physischer Symbiose direkt. Die Zellen des Hyphed sind mit einer Steuereinheit verbunden, die als Datenschnittstelle funktioniert. Die Wurzeln stellen in Kombination mit dem symbiotischen Myzel (Mykorrhiza-Pilze) Zucker und Mineralstoffe bereit, welches das Hyphed für seine Funktion benötigt.\n\nUm die synthetische Steuereinheit zu betreiben besitzt das Hyphed in abgeschlossenen Bereichen des Produktkörpers eine Anreicherung des Bakterium Rhodoferax ferrireducens, welches aus einem Anteil des Zuckers elektrischen Strom für die Steuereinheit bietet. Ist das Hyphed verpflanzt kann es nach zwei bis drei Wochen Wachstum des Myzels betrieben werden.\n\nDer Datenschreibvorgang findet in den Zellen der Oberfläche des Hyphed statt. Dabei nehmen Zellen Phosphor bzw. Stickstoff durch die anliegenden Hyphen des Myzels auf. \n\nDas Hyphed stellt drei Zelltypen zur Verfügung. Eine mit Stickstoff befüllbare, eine mit Phosphor befüllbare, und eine Mischzelle. Die komplett mit Stickstoff angefüllte Zelle wird als digitale Information 1 und die mit Phosphor angefüllte Zelle mit der digitalen Information 0 interpretiert. Zellen welche eine Verhältniskonzentration von Stickstoff und Phosphor zulassen, speichern damit auch sozusagen gleichzeitig Verhältnisse. Damit sind Speicherzustände auch in einer erweiterten Form denkbar.\n\n \n Ist eine Zelle beschrieben, stellt sie die Zuckerausgabe ein und versiegelt die Öffnung zum Myzel. Wird die Zelle wieder zurückgesetzt oder gelöscht, gibt sie den enthaltenen Mineralstoff wieder durch einen von der Steuereinheit abgegebenen Impuls an ihr anliegendes Hyphen des Myzels ab. Ein Schreib- bzw. Löschvorgang funktioniert somit nur durch eine Interaktion mit dem Pilzmyzel selbst.\n\nDie Produktfamilie von Hyphed besteht aus dem Standard mit 500 TB (Jungpflanze), dem Module mit 2000 TB (Mehrjährige Baumpflanze), und dem Enterprise (Waldstück bzw. Anmietung eines angepflanzten ausgewachsenen Waldes) mit skalierbaren Zettabytes. Die Enterprise Lösung kann auch in vorhandene schon bestehende Wälder integriert beziehungsweise appliziert werden.\n\nDas optionale Commute-Modul lässt sich jedem Produkt hinzufügen und bietet einen sogenannten Hyphenlink. Damit ist der Informationsaustausch über das sogenannte »World Wide Hyphen Network« denkbar. Signale werden damit, ohne die Funktion und Form der natürlichen Hyphen zu beinträchtigen, über ihr Myzel-Netzwerk zu anderen Hyphed Produkten übertragen. Eine alternative ökologisch natürlich symbiotische Form der Informationskommunikation.  \n  \n ---", "timestamp": 1635953925, "digest": "Z7URzoFbmv3DGPX-8j74bUOQb4dFvIb2XhySKYf_V3k", "contributor": "0x12d7CCC2454111af7039E27Af42b919893d4cCA2"}

It is not uncommon for this to lead to an infection of the organism and even to organ-damaging dysfunction. A unique interaction potential. In order to develop this function, the evolutionary development of viruses, which already started from the evolution of metabolism-based microorganisms, certainly plays a decisive role. What other particle that works so efficiently uses a comparably relevant functionality as a method? \n \nThe ruse of disguising itself as the body's own particle, which enters the human cell's own production sites and subsequently uses them for its own replication without being noticed, is a highly efficient and dangerous strategy. \n \nThis characteristic creates a global need to think, analyse and produce new modules and possibilities to ensure the health of the earth's population. In the best case, to protect preventively. \n \nIn 2021, the German Centre for Vaccine Research still estimates that it will take 10 years to produce a validated drug or a serum that can be injected into humans as a vaccine with acceptable side effects. \n \nThe Anthropocene shows a further progressive takeover of untouched fauna and flora. Original habitats that have not yet been touched by humans, with their microbiological natural diversity, are being incorporated automatically, so to speak, through urban expansion. It is obvious that the list of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), which was compiled in the 1970s, will be expanded in the future by a large number of as yet unknown viruses.\n\nTechnological developments enable us to understand the sequencing of DNA. From this, relevant RNA structures can be extracted. These can be understood concerning their function: used, produced, specially designed and subsequently transcribed. As highly specialised parts, these genome sequences offer the initiation of specific molecular genetic production of necessary proteins in cells, which can be translated again by the cell's ribosomes into process-triggering proteins. These proteins are, for example, fundamentally responsible for triggering a necessary preventive immune response of the body in critical situation even years later. \n \nResearch and science, as demonstrated in 2020 by the SarsCov-2 virus pandemic, are capable of equipping humans with a preventive immunising immune response through biotechnologically developed seras in the shortest possible time, testing them and making them available in high quantities after testing. To achieve this, the development of all highly specialised individual processes requires intensive research, detailed precision, high technology, complex production facilities, meticulous personalisation of methodology, lengthy evaluation as well as time for explicit testing of efficacy. Not to mention the effort of adapting different serums for immune system function to individual classes of viruses and their constant natural mutation.\n\n![UTH.16.1 Metapolycistronics mRNA parts computational simulation](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s8R6X75QkaQiXYO8UjVUP.jpg?height=1920&width=1920)\n\nWhat if we could develop a digital simulation that would be able to correlate ecological evolution/mutation of our natural habitat and human anatomical evolution/mutation to predict protein diversity by simulating RNA, including change and expansion of the organism's overall immune composition, in evolution and interrelationship? How would it be if information for future viruses could be distilled from this and at the same time already provided with a blueprint for immunisation through a serum vaccine?\n\nThe METAPOLYCISTRONICS (MPC) is a system with several coupled computational simulations, which work in the mutual alignment of their results. An immunisation via intelligent genome engineering. The MPC develops solution model data, such as foreseeable constellations of possible virus genomes with directly associated solution approaches from mRNA classifications. \n \nA first model module of the active continuous digital simulation classifies detailed current proteins of the human immune system as a basic catalogue. As an extension, new possible proteins and DNA changes, which can be predicted in ecological as well as anatomical evolution and their mutual condition, are simulated, so to speak, in options and variations computationally chaotically modelled. \n \nAnother model module uses current and known viral genome structures from their RNA or DNA and evolutionises/mutates them. In the process, the model transcribes not yet known mRNA parts that contain an above-average change compared to the known sequences of the genetic information and makes these available to the overall system in a prioritisation. \n \nThe coupling of the two models creates an overall simulation that is constantly synchronised with each other. Representable, visualisable potential new virus classifications with a directly related selection of relevant mRNA sequences of the new virus speculations can be recognised and output preventively.\n\n![UTH.16.2 Metapolycistronics mRNA parts computational simulation detail](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QvQ9Y8WiWLABckXuiZ4c5.jpg?height=7926&width=7926)\n\nFrom the generated data results, MPC can be used to assemble a polychronistic sequence guide for multidimensional multi-mRNA as the basis of a combination vaccine to be produced. This vaccine not only responds to current facts of an upcoming new viral pandemic but also covers evolutionary preventive immunisation evolutions with a thereby initiated protein diversity in the human body. \n \nAn MPC serum with its polychronistic messenger-RNA can initiate and output diverse different proteins through its calculated intelligent structure and sequence of nucleotide sequences in the human cell to preventively and actively train the immune system on an ongoing basis. \n  \n  The serum can be available and administered to patients in an annual subscription. Personalisation of personal immune data can be included in the MPC. The natural evolution of the anatomical function of the immune system is thus an essential part of the overall system and is actively included in the simulation. Intelligent training of the immune system is accomplished and can act as a continuous automated immunisation.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_KVLzpw2eM3wmOme1O3eM.jpg?height=1920&width=1920)\n\n\\---\n\nViren, als nicht lebensfähig klassifizierte organische Teilchen,  stellen mit ihrer enthaltenen Funktion durch einen lebenden Wirt zu einer Multiplikation ihrer selbst. Nicht selten kommt es dabei zu einer Infektion des Organismus bis hin zu einer organschädigenden Dysfunktion. Ein einzigartiges Interaktionspotential. Um diese Funktion zu entwickeln spielt sicherlich die evolutionäre Entwicklung der Viren, welche schon von der Evolution der stoffwechselbasierten Mikroorganismen begann, eine ausschlaggebende Rolle. Welches andere so effizient arbeitende Teilchen nutzt eine vergleichbar relevante Funktionalität als Methode.\n\nIn der List, sich als körpereigenes Modul zu verschleiern, welches die menschlich zelleigenen Produktionsstätten betritt und diese anschließend für die eigene Replikation unbemerkt nutzt, ist eine hocheffiziente und gefährliche Strategie.\n\nAus dieser Eigenschaft entsteht eine globale Notwendigkeit, neue Module und Möglichkeiten zu denken, zu analysieren und herzustellen, um die Gesundheit der Erdbevölkerung zu gewährleisten. Im besten Falle präventiv zu schützen.\n\n2021 gibt das Deutsche Zentrum für Impfstoffforschung die Herstellung eines validierten Medikamentes, beziehungsweise die Herstellung eines dem Menschen mit vertretbaren Nebenwirkungen injizierbaren Serums als Impfung, immer noch mit 10 Jahren an.\n\nDas Anthropozän zeigt eine weiter fortschreitende Übernahme von unberührter Fauna und Flora. Ursprüngliche, noch nicht durch den Menschen genutzter Lebensräume mit ihrer mikrobiologischen natürlichen Vielfalt werden durch die urbane Ausdehnung sozusagen automatisiert einverleibt. Dabei liegt auf der Hand, das die in den 1970ger Jahren erstellte Liste des International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) in Zukunft durch eine Vielzahl noch unbekannter Viren erweitert werden wird.\n\nTechnologische Entwicklungen ermöglichen uns ein Verständnis der Sequenzierungen von DNA. Daraus lassen sich relevante RNA Strukturen herauslösen. Diese können im Bezug zu ihrer Funktion verstanden, genutzt, hergestellt, eigens gestaltet wie anschliessend transkribiert werden. Als hoch spezialisierte Anteile bieten diese Genomsequenzen in Zellen die Initiation spezifischer molekulargenetischer Produktion von notwendigen Proteinen, welche durch die zelleigenen Ribosomen wieder in prozessauslösende Proteine übersetzt werden können. Diese Proteine sind zum Beispiel grundlegend dafür verantwortlich eine wenn notwendige präventive Immunantwort des Körpers auszulösen.\n\nForschung und Wissenschaft sind, wie 2020 die SarsCov-2 Viruspandemie vorführt, in der Lage, den Menschen mit einer präventiv immunisierenden Immunantwort durch biotechnologisch entwickelte Seras in kürzester Zeit auszustatten, diese zu testen und in hohen Mengen nach Prüfung bereitzustellen. Dazu benötigt die Entwicklung aller hoch spezialisierten einzelnen Vorgänge intensive Forschung, detailgenaue Präzision, Hochtechnologie, komplexe Produktionsstätten, minutiöse Personalisierung der Methodik, langwierige Evaluation wie Zeit zur expliziten Prüfung der Wirksamkeit. Ganz abgesehen des Aufwandes der Anpassung verschiedener Seras für die Funktion des Immunsystems auf einzelne Klassen von Viren und deren ständige natürliche Mutation.\n\nWie wäre es, wenn wir eine digitale Simulation entwickeln, welche in der Lage wäre, ökologische Evolution/Mutation unseres natürlichen Lebensraumes und der anatomischen Evolution/Mutation des Menschen in Bezug zu setzten, um eine Proteindiversität, auch Veränderung und Erweiterung der gesamten Immunzusammensetzung des Organismus, in Entwicklung und wechselseitiger Beziehung vorherzusagen? Wie wäre es wenn daraus Informationen für zukünftige Viren destilliert und gleichzeitig schon mit einem Bauplan für die Immunisierung durch einen Serumimpfstoff bereitstellt werden würden?\n\nDas METAPOLYCISTRONICS (MPC) ist ein System mit mehreren gekoppelten computergestützten Softwaresimulationen, welche in gegenseitigem Abgleich ihrer Ergebnisse funktioniert. Das MPC entwickelt Lösungsmodelle, wie vorherzusehende Konstellationen von möglich auftretenden Virusgenomen mit dazu direkt zugeordneten Lösungsansätzen aus mRNA Klassifikationen.\n\nEin erstes Modellmodul der aktiven immer fortlaufenden digitalen Simulation klassifiziert Details, wie aktuelle Proteinkataloge des humanen Immunsystems als Basiskatalog. Als Erweiterung werden neue mögliche Proteine und DNA Veränderungen, welche sich in der ökologischen wie anatomischen Evolution und deren gegenseitige Bedingung vermuten, sozusagen simuliert, in Optionen und Variationen rechnerisch chaotisch modelliert.\n\nEin weiteres Modellmodul nutzt aktuelle wie bekannte virale Genomstrukturen aus deren RNA beziehungsweise DNA und evolutioniert beziehungsweise mutiert diese. Im Vorgang transkribiert das Modell noch nicht bekannte mRNA Anteile, welche eine überdurchschnittliche Veränderung gegenüber den bekannten Sequenzen der Erbgutinformation enthalten, und stellt diese in einer Priorisierung dem Gesamtsystem zur Verfügung.\n\nDie Koppelung beider Modelle erzeugt eine sich ständig gegenseitig abgleichende Gesamtsimulation. Darstellbare, visualisierbare potenzielle neue Virusklassifikationen mit direkt bezogener Selektion relevanter mRNA Sequenzen der neuen Virusspekulationen sind präventiv zu erkennen und auszugeben.\n\nAus den erzeugten Datenergebnissen kann MPC dazu genutzt werden eine polychronistische Sequenzanleitung für mehrdimensionale Multi-mRNA als Basis eines herzustellenden Kombinationsimpfstoffs zusammensetzten. Dieser Impfstoff reagiert nicht nur auf aktuelle Fakten einer anstehenden neuen Viruspandemie, sondern deckt evolutionsbedingte präventive Immunisierungsevolutionen mit einer dadurch initiierten Proteindiversität im menschlichen Körper ab.\n\nEin MPC-Serum ist mit seiner multivariablen MessengerRNA in der Lage, durch seine berechnete intelligente Struktur und Abfolge der Nukleotidsequenzen in der menschlichen Zelle diverse unterschiedliche Proteine zu initiieren und auszugeben, um präventiv und aktiv das Immunsystem fortlaufend zu schulen. Das Serum kann in einem Jahresabonnement Patienten zur Verfügung stehen und verabreicht werden. Eine Personalisierung persönlicher Immundaten kann in das MPC einbezogen werden.\n\nDie natürliche Evolution der anatomischen Funktionalität des Immunsystems ist damit essenzieller Teil des Gesamtsystems und ist in die Simulation aktiv mit einbezogen. Eine intelligente Schulung des Immunsystems wird vollzogen und kann als fortlaufende automatisierte Immunisierung wirken.\n\n\n---", "timestamp": 1635954236, "digest": "y19mCvGylh4xYUljE8gtidCj8qZH1X7o0S9xQ9maTxI", "contributor": "0x12d7CCC2454111af7039E27Af42b919893d4cCA2"}

She’s become a master at observing some of our strangest behaviours online while covering the deepest corners of the web. As a big fan of her writings, I had a lot of questions about her methods, analyses and findings. Below is the recap of our conversation.*\n\n**Note:** This interview was recorded on October 5th, 2021.\n\n\n---\n\n**Hi Fadeke, thanks for accepting my invitation! As a loyal [Cybernaut](https://every.to/cybernaut) reader, I’m happy to have you here to talk about your experience building this awesome publication. Before launching the newsletter with the Every collective, you worked on content marketing at Doist. During my research for this interview, I also realized that you wrote the fantastic [Holloway Guide To Using Twitter](https://www.holloway.com/g/using-twitter) that I have recommended a lot in my newsletter. You were initially focused more on actionable content than in-depth analyses of internet cultures. So I was wondering: how did it all start for Cybernaut?**\n\nWorking at Doist helped me fall in love with long-form writing. Our pieces on remote work or productivity were anywhere between 2500 and 6000 words –– not your typical content marketing. Besides that, I’ve always been interested in technology’s impact on society. Hence the idea of Cybernaut: a newsletter with long-form essays exploring how people and platforms interact with one another. I wanted to write about how platforms shape people and vice versa. These are phenomenons I read a lot about and get the chance to observe within online communities. My goal with Cybernaut is diving into internet culture topics and spending time cataloging and discussing what I find.\n\n**And you do it wonderfully! I shared several Cybernaut articles in the newsletter and [the one on LinkedIn](https://every.to/cybernaut/linkedins-alternate-universe-21780381-7883) is probably the funniest take I’ve read this year. Before digging your (vast) topic of predilection together, I wanted to ask you: what is exactly “internet culture”? And does it concern everybody online or just some of us?**\n\nInternet culture has a ton of different definitions. It’s often associated with Gen Z but I consider it much broader than that. There was briefly a solid line between “real life” and whatever happens online. But since everything we do is embedded within the web, internet culture has simply become culture itself. We can't escape it.\n\nFor instance, it was so interesting to see the response and discussion while Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp were down \\[the day before the interview\\]. The noticeable difference we experience when these platforms are gone reveals the huge facets of our lives they represent. The reactions on Twitter yesterday showed an interesting aspect of internet culture: what happens when some of the sites that we rely on are no longer available to us?\n\n**The good news for you is, internet culture seems an endless source of inspiration for your writings. So far you have covered topics like parasocial relationships, online fandom, and the hustle narrative. How do you pick the topics you write about? And what’s your approach to analyzing the cultures you choose?**\n\nI read a lot online and tend to fall down rabbit holes. When I notice an interesting trend or phenomenon, I often want to know where it starts and where it ends. So I just keep digging. For instance, my article on the [Study Web](https://every.to/cybernaut/caught-in-the-study-web) was born out of seeing a lot of study content on TikTok. I was familiar with such content on YouTube and I wanted to see differences with platforms like Reddit and Discord. I found out that there are so many corners of the internet where students are relying on one another to succeed at school. There is also a lot of pressure and anxiety around achievement. Of course, it’s a phenomenon that has accelerated because of the pandemic. It would have been much harder to analyze this if students were on campus instead of all being online.\n\nSo digging and observing is stage one. But if I am actually decided on writing on a topic, then I'll go further. I reach out to people within those communities to see if they're willing to chat and give me more insight. I recently [wrote a piece about anti-fandoms](https://every.to/cybernaut/the-anti-fan-phenomenon), that is communities where people bond over the common practice of loving to hate on public figures. I found the phenomenon bizarre –– I didn't understand it on the surface because I couldn't imagine myself or people I know doing this.\n\nSo I really wanted to speak to people within the community and ask what they find so captivating about these spaces. I managed to talk to three people within a particular community, Gossip Gate, that was dedicated to hating a wide array of influencers. I discovered they had actually been true fans of the influencers at one point. They somehow became disenchanted along the way and considered these spaces as a form of entertainment. So you can’t just observe such phenomenons and hope to understand without having any interactions with the community.\n\n**This explains how you manage to keep a certain neutrality by not being judgemental in your writings. And yet, some traits of the cultures you observe can appear as cringe, shallow, ridiculous or even depressing. Still, you introduce yourself as a “tech optimist” in your Twitter bio. What makes you feel that way about the Internet?**\n\nI believe that technology has a positive impact on the world –– which is not to say that it can't have a negative one. I'm hopeful that the next generation of technologists will have a more mindful approach to shaping online experiences for all. Most people act with good intent –– I think it’s true for most founders building tech companies and most people interacting with others online. Of course, there are bad actors. But I don't think that is the majority.\n\nI live in the grey. This probably reflects in my writings. When I [wrote about Clubhouse](https://every.to/cybernaut/cashing-in-on-clubhouse), it was a time when people were quite critical of the platform and describing it as a failed experiment. While I thought there were some changes that made the app less spontaneous and interesting, I really enjoyed my time on Clubhouse. Bringing people together through the medium of voice is definitely an interesting and intimate experience. I didn’t want to write another take just for the sake of bashing the app –– even though it would have probably garnered more attention and engagement.\n\n**Traditional media are often merciless regarding Big Tech. Today, it just seems inconceivable to read a single positive article about companies like Facebook or Google in the press. Do you think that all the negative coverage on these platforms is always justified?**\n\nIt's interesting that you ask that on the day after Facebook went down. People around the world lost connectivity to their friends and family because WhatsApp was unavailable. It’s a massive medium of communication, especially in developing countries where it is a pillar for both individuals and small businesses.\n\nIn many ways, Facebook has had a positive impact on the world. But that doesn’t make them above scrutiny or criticism. Recently, the company made headlines regarding their own findings regarding how Instagram may impact the mental health of young users. It’s worthwhile for the press to dig into things like that.\n\nOn the other hand, the tech press is not above criticism either. There are many instances where outlets are not discerning as they could (and should) be. It’s more important than ever to have real debates that address nuance and complexity rather than simply pointing fingers.\n\n**Speaking of this, what are some of the issues on the Internet that strike you most?**\n\nI’m interested in how algorithms can drive human behaviour. For instance, their capacity to magnify and amplify highly engaging content – sometimes for the better and very often for the worse – is something I think about a lot. On Twitter, it’s always concerning to see someone’s name trending, often for some minor non-offense, that leads to pile-ons and harassment that in many ways feel sanctioned by the platform and become a common behaviour.\n\nIt’s also interesting how people “hack” algorithms. There is this meme called [Soylent Grin](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/soy-boy-face-soyjak) referring to a particular facial expression where people have their mouth wide open, looking shocked. You might have noticed that in many YouTube thumbnails –– it’s “thumbnail face”.\n\nThere’s a great video on the Veritasium YouTube channel on the [effectiveness of clickbait](https://youtu.be/S2xHZPH5Sng), that discusses how important thumbnails are to creators garnering clicks. The algorithm learns a behaviour that generates more clicks and boosts videos with that attribute. As a result, creators took notice and suddenly everyone was doing the Soylent Grin. I think that's an interesting example to illustrate how algorithms can drive behaviour.\n\nThis phenomenon is even more evident on TikTok. Fashion trends proliferate overnight because of viral TikTok videos. That's what I mean when I say that the frontier between internet culture and IRL culture has been shrinking.\n\n**Among the different internet cultures that you have observed so far, which one do you think was the most fascinating?**\n\nI've been thinking a lot about [parasocial relationships](https://every.to/cybernaut/the-blurred-lines-of-parasocial-relationships) after my series of articles on the subject in Cybernaut. It’s a term that was coined in 1956 by Donald Horton and Richard Wohl. They initially described the bonds that TV viewers developed with movie screen actors. But since the rise of the internet, and especially social media, we've just seen these relationships proliferate and soar online.\n\nToday, internet creators are very intimately tied with their audiences. After all, they often speak directly to them through the camera. Influencers show who they are by streaming their private life. They are showing their morning routine, going grocery shopping, spending the weekends with their family members at barbecues. So they give true insight into their lives. This level of access to someone’s life is much deeper than with an actor simply doing their job. Going forward, I think it’s a very important phenomenon to keep an eye on.\n\n**But I’m wondering, aren’t we all doing that on TikTok or Instagram? It’s probably a chicken and egg dilemma, but do you explain parasocial relationships by the fact that we all behave like influencers online or by the fact that influencers just act like everyone?**\n\nThat's an interesting question. We live in an era where everyone has a personal brand, whether it’s on Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram or TikTok. We have a certain image online that can be very different from that of our personal life. On the one hand, a lot of people tend to polish their online presence to gain views, likes and influence. But on the other hand, online creators cultivate this deep intimacy with their audiences.\n\nIn the first piece that I wrote about parasocial relationships, I gave an anecdote about the two creators of my favourite podcast: Hila and Ethan Klein. During a livestream, they told their audience that Hila was pregnant right after they found it –– bypassing the customary three-month waiting period. Announcements like that are extremely intimate and many of us don't even share those details with their own friends and family. But some online creators share some of the most intimate aspects of their lives, including death, divorce, depression or miscarriage. Such close connections between people and their audience is what drives parasocial relationships today.\n\n**The funny thing is that this trend actually has an opposite with the rise of anonymity online. We can see that with “anon” accounts on Twitter or with most teenagers having a “Finsta”. According to you, what are the main consequences of having such fluid identities online?**\n\nThis is such a fascinating topic. People are complex and have some facets of their identity that they want to hide –– or not have associated with their real name or professional identity. Being able to obscure your identity online allows some people to feel more comfortable in self-expression.\n\nThere is also this whole thesis about the [pseudonymous economy](https://youtu.be/gkJqMSbI1IA) developed by Balaji Srinivasan. It's an interesting idea about potentially earning money, starting a company, and making a living online detached from your real identity using blockchain technology. I think we'll be seeing a lot more of that in the future.\n\n**There is this traditional cliche that when people behave anonymously, they will take advantage of the situation to scam or harass without consequence. But for others, concealing personal traits like your name, face or gender is precisely what prevents them from being harassed.**\n\nYes, pseudonymity can be a way for people to feel free to be themselves and speak plainly without fear of backlash — including speaking up about social issues they care about. While it can be valuable for avoiding discrimination related to your gender, race, or sexual orientation, it’s a bandaid solution.\n\n**Protecting people from being discriminated against at work remains a solid argument in favour of Balaji Srinivasan’s thesis. This reminds me of [the interview I had with Jackson Dame](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/llZnEhKaVQrxGOW2sE6aiiG3LknPy1UXJoifAXB2Mc8) two months ago, when we discussed the opportunities offered by crypto to help marginalized people build a better future for themselves. Anonymity is one of the features of Web3 that can be life-changing for underprivileged people. Another implication of Finstas and anon accounts is that still more people do have multiple social accounts – which is a big cultural shift.**\n\nExactly. And that’s a pretty big deal. Having multiple identities also means having multiple modes of expression. People get to decide which extensions of themselves they want to cultivate privately. You might have a Twitter account with your real name in which you keep things professional and tailored for your audience. And then you can run a pseudonymous account for activism, political debate, or something else entirely on the side.\n\n**Still, I think it's kind of sad that some people tend to “specialize” in social media. I tend to value online creators who act like whole persons and don’t perform a certain role to please a certain audience.**\n\nPeople often can’t deal with complexity online, there’s a desire to categorize or put things into neat boxes. It’s more challenging than ever to find nuanced discussions online or people who can hold onto more than one idea at a time. Alt accounts can help navigate this by letting people explore different ideas separately from their primary identities.\n\n**But can we truly consider that removing information by going anonymous as a viable way to fix the polarization of debates online? As a writer, I tend to consider that context is key to understand and relate to a story.**\n\nI don’t think pseudonymity or anonymity are solutions to polarization, no. The desire for pseudonymity may never reach a critical mass. Many people will still want to have their real identities out in the world. But it doesn’t need to be binary. Just like what we see with Finsta these days, many people are likely to keep their true identity online while going pseudonymous for specific facets of their life.\n\n**Time will tell! Also, this conversation went even deeper than what I initially thought. So thanks a lot Fadeke, it was a pleasure to learn more about your approach behind your fantastic articles. I can’t wait to see which new cultures you’ll explore next with Cybernaut. Take care!**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RycUCZDipLjiLdqd8qKOy.gif?height=270&width=500)\n\n### 4 interesting corners of the internet, curated by Fadeke:\n\n* **[#PrisonTok](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/prisontok?lang=en)** : *“TikTok is one of my favorite platforms because we often see and hear from “unlikely creators” –– from blue collar workers cleaning pools for a living or people residing (mostly) off-grid in remote parts of Hawaii or The Yukon. #PrisonTok (or #JailTok) lets users hear from people we rarely get to: the incarcerated population. Getting an unvarnished look into life inside, outside television or a documentary, is one of the more interesting sections of TikTok.”*\n* **[KnowYourMeme](https://knowyourmeme.com/)** : *“KnowYourMeme is one of the most impressive encyclopedias of popular internet culture that exists today.

Some recent favorites include “[Spent All Last Night Crying About The Wage Gap (I'm 6'3\" BTW)](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/spent-all-last-night-crying-about-the-wage-gap-im-63-btw)” and “[Violation Of My HIPAA Rights](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/violation-of-my-hipaa-rights).”*\n* **[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)** : *“The Internet Archive is a super impressive digital library that often lets you take a peek into early internet culture if you know where to look. The tag “[computermagazines](https://archive.org/details/computermagazines)” often yields some interesting gems including early editions of publications like PC Magazine and MacWorld.”*\n* **[NoSurf](https://nosurf.net/)** : *“The ubiquity of the internet inevitably means some people want to escape it. NoSurf is an interesting movement, which includes online communities across Discord and a Subreddit, where people seek support on disconnecting from the web and living fuller lives offline. It’s fascinating to see how people discuss the internet and it’s grip on them.”*\n\n\n---\n\n### Read my other interviews:\n\n* **[Navigating Web3 with fresh eyes, with Jackson Dame](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/llZnEhKaVQrxGOW2sE6aiiG3LknPy1UXJoifAXB2Mc8)**\n* **[The emerging Internet Renaissance, with Patrick Rivera](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/BoEyMiW_B2DoUZlFNKdfXRn59goHfrsPwvdM8KiLhb4)**\n* **[Following the right rabbit holes, with Sari Azout](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/VclwDqX-nSxzQTeJnJCTyMkzsvP_IJxwomzUaOYmq1k)**\n* **[Choose your own writing adventure, with Max Nussenbaum](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/9GZm-IGk-oL_OmxsLHl_fEApuZd3a5NkaITLS7jJ3ck)**\n* **[Pioneering the passion economy, with Li Jin](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/cKbvFpq0mV_-E0gM4GKmk8w-CYrKZF8ByC1nN2xm07E)**\n* **[Building a new school for the mind, with Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/GD03ufsBOrDkKjO9psSLro0PEqC64So_t_uC39N20Hs)**", "timestamp": 1635955427, "digest": "2GxCJJ8HDkomBrgENLvVuq0Ao7co0sbl2QoeetAuZvU", "contributor": "0xb18501548Eeb4660c2348A75515e2740041999F6"}

We can't escape it.\n\nFor instance, it was so interesting to see the response and discussion while Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp were down \\[the day before the interview\\]. The noticeable difference we experience when these platforms are gone reveals the huge facets of our lives they represent. The reactions on Twitter yesterday showed an interesting aspect of internet culture: what happens when some of the sites that we rely on are no longer available to us?\n\n**The good news for you is, internet culture seems an endless source of inspiration for your writings. So far you have covered topics like parasocial relationships, online fandom, and the hustle narrative. How do you pick the topics you write about? And what’s your approach to analyzing the cultures you choose?**\n\nI read a lot online and tend to fall down rabbit holes. When I notice an interesting trend or phenomenon, I often want to know where it starts and where it ends. So I just keep digging. For instance, my article on the [Study Web](https://every.to/cybernaut/caught-in-the-study-web) was born out of seeing a lot of study content on TikTok. I was familiar with such content on YouTube and I wanted to see differences with platforms like Reddit and Discord. I found out that there are so many corners of the internet where students are relying on one another to succeed at school. There is also a lot of pressure and anxiety around achievement. Of course, it’s a phenomenon that has accelerated because of the pandemic. It would have been much harder to analyze this if students were on campus instead of all being online.\n\nSo digging and observing is stage one. But if I am actually decided on writing on a topic, then I'll go further. I reach out to people within those communities to see if they're willing to chat and give me more insight. I recently [wrote a piece about anti-fandoms](https://every.to/cybernaut/the-anti-fan-phenomenon), that is communities where people bond over the common practice of loving to hate on public figures. I found the phenomenon bizarre –– I didn't understand it on the surface because I couldn't imagine myself or people I know doing this.\n\nSo I really wanted to speak to people within the community and ask what they find so captivating about these spaces. I managed to talk to three people within a particular community, Gossip Gate, that was dedicated to hating a wide array of influencers. I discovered they had actually been true fans of the influencers at one point. They somehow became disenchanted along the way and considered these spaces as a form of entertainment. So you can’t just observe such phenomenons and hope to understand without having any interactions with the community.\n\n**This explains how you manage to keep a certain neutrality by not being judgemental in your writings. And yet, some traits of the cultures you observe can appear as cringe, shallow, ridiculous or even depressing. Still, you introduce yourself as a “tech optimist” in your Twitter bio. What makes you feel that way about the Internet?**\n\nI believe that technology has a positive impact on the world –– which is not to say that it can't have a negative one. I'm hopeful that the next generation of technologists will have a more mindful approach to shaping online experiences for all. Most people act with good intent –– I think it’s true for most founders building tech companies and most people interacting with others online. Of course, there are bad actors. But I don't think that is the majority.\n\nI live in the grey. This probably reflects in my writings. When I [wrote about Clubhouse](https://every.to/cybernaut/cashing-in-on-clubhouse), it was a time when people were quite critical of the platform and describing it as a failed experiment. While I thought there were some changes that made the app less spontaneous and interesting, I really enjoyed my time on Clubhouse. Bringing people together through the medium of voice is definitely an interesting and intimate experience. I didn’t want to write another take just for the sake of bashing the app –– even though it would have probably garnered more attention and engagement.\n\n**Traditional media are often merciless regarding Big Tech. Today, it just seems inconceivable to read a single positive article about companies like Facebook or Google in the press. Do you think that all the negative coverage on these platforms is always justified?**\n\nIt's interesting that you ask that on the day after Facebook went down. People around the world lost connectivity to their friends and family because WhatsApp was unavailable. It’s a massive medium of communication, especially in developing countries where it is a pillar for both individuals and small businesses.\n\nIn many ways, Facebook has had a positive impact on the world. But that doesn’t make them above scrutiny or criticism. Recently, the company made headlines regarding their own findings regarding how Instagram may impact the mental health of young users. It’s worthwhile for the press to dig into things like that.\n\nOn the other hand, the tech press is not above criticism either. There are many instances where outlets are not discerning as they could (and should) be. It’s more important than ever to have real debates that address nuance and complexity rather than simply pointing fingers.\n\n**Speaking of this, what are some of the issues on the Internet that strike you most?**\n\nI’m interested in how algorithms can drive human behaviour. For instance, their capacity to magnify and amplify highly engaging content – sometimes for the better and very often for the worse – is something I think about a lot. On Twitter, it’s always concerning to see someone’s name trending, often for some minor non-offense, that leads to pile-ons and harassment that in many ways feel sanctioned by the platform and become a common behaviour.\n\nIt’s also interesting how people “hack” algorithms. There is this meme called [Soylent Grin](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/soy-boy-face-soyjak) referring to a particular facial expression where people have their mouth wide open, looking shocked. You might have noticed that in many YouTube thumbnails –– it’s “thumbnail face”.\n\nThere’s a great video on the Veritasium YouTube channel on the [effectiveness of clickbait](https://youtu.be/S2xHZPH5Sng), that discusses how important thumbnails are to creators garnering clicks. The algorithm learns a behaviour that generates more clicks and boosts videos with that attribute. As a result, creators took notice and suddenly everyone was doing the Soylent Grin. I think that's an interesting example to illustrate how algorithms can drive behaviour.\n\nThis phenomenon is even more evident on TikTok. Fashion trends proliferate overnight because of viral TikTok videos. That's what I mean when I say that the frontier between internet culture and IRL culture has been shrinking.\n\n**Among the different internet cultures that you have observed so far, which one do you think was the most fascinating?**\n\nI've been thinking a lot about [parasocial relationships](https://every.to/cybernaut/the-blurred-lines-of-parasocial-relationships) after my series of articles on the subject in Cybernaut. It’s a term that was coined in 1956 by Donald Horton and Richard Wohl. They initially described the bonds that TV viewers developed with movie screen actors. But since the rise of the internet, and especially social media, we've just seen these relationships proliferate and soar online.\n\nToday, internet creators are very intimately tied with their audiences. After all, they often speak directly to them through the camera. Influencers show who they are by streaming their private life. They are showing their morning routine, going grocery shopping, spending the weekends with their family members at barbecues. So they give true insight into their lives. This level of access to someone’s life is much deeper than with an actor simply doing their job. Going forward, I think it’s a very important phenomenon to keep an eye on.\n\n**But I’m wondering, aren’t we all doing that on TikTok or Instagram? It’s probably a chicken and egg dilemma, but do you explain parasocial relationships by the fact that we all behave like influencers online or by the fact that influencers just act like everyone?**\n\nThat's an interesting question. We live in an era where everyone has a personal brand, whether it’s on Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram or TikTok. We have a certain image online that can be very different from that of our personal life. On the one hand, a lot of people tend to polish their online presence to gain views, likes and influence. But on the other hand, online creators cultivate this deep intimacy with their audiences.\n\nIn the first piece that I wrote about parasocial relationships, I gave an anecdote about the two creators of my favourite podcast: Hila and Ethan Klein. During a livestream, they told their audience that Hila was pregnant right after they found it –– bypassing the customary three-month waiting period. Announcements like that are extremely intimate and many of us don't even share those details with their own friends and family. But some online creators share some of the most intimate aspects of their lives, including death, divorce, depression or miscarriage. Such close connections between people and their audience is what drives parasocial relationships today.\n\n**The funny thing is that this trend actually has an opposite with the rise of anonymity online. We can see that with “anon” accounts on Twitter or with most teenagers having a “Finsta”. According to you, what are the main consequences of having such fluid identities online?**\n\nThis is such a fascinating topic. People are complex and have some facets of their identity that they want to hide –– or not have associated with their real name or professional identity. Being able to obscure your identity online allows some people to feel more comfortable in self-expression.\n\nThere is also this whole thesis about the [pseudonymous economy](https://youtu.be/gkJqMSbI1IA) developed by Balaji Srinivasan. It's an interesting idea about potentially earning money, starting a company, and making a living online detached from your real identity using blockchain technology. I think we'll be seeing a lot more of that in the future.\n\n**There is this traditional cliche that when people behave anonymously, they will take advantage of the situation to scam or harass without consequence. But for others, concealing personal traits like your name, face or gender is precisely what prevents them from being harassed.**\n\nYes, pseudonymity can be a way for people to feel free to be themselves and speak plainly without fear of backlash — including speaking up about social issues they care about. While it can be valuable for avoiding discrimination related to your gender, race, or sexual orientation, it’s a bandaid solution.\n\n**Protecting people from being discriminated against at work remains a solid argument in favour of Balaji Srinivasan’s thesis. This reminds me of [the interview I had with Jackson Dame](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/llZnEhKaVQrxGOW2sE6aiiG3LknPy1UXJoifAXB2Mc8) two months ago, when we discussed the opportunities offered by crypto to help marginalized people build a better future for themselves. Anonymity is one of the features of Web3 that can be life-changing for underprivileged people. Another implication of Finstas and anon accounts is that still more people do have multiple social accounts – which is a big cultural shift.**\n\nExactly. And that’s a pretty big deal. Having multiple identities also means having multiple modes of expression. People get to decide which extensions of themselves they want to cultivate privately. You might have a Twitter account with your real name in which you keep things professional and tailored for your audience. And then you can run a pseudonymous account for activism, political debate, or something else entirely on the side.\n\n**Still, I think it's kind of sad that some people tend to “specialize” in social media. I tend to value online creators who act like whole persons and don’t perform a certain role to please a certain audience.**\n\nPeople often can’t deal with complexity online, there’s a desire to categorize or put things into neat boxes. It’s more challenging than ever to find nuanced discussions online or people who can hold onto more than one idea at a time. Alt accounts can help navigate this by letting people explore different ideas separately from their primary identities.\n\n**But can we truly consider that removing information by going anonymous as a viable way to fix the polarization of debates online? As a writer, I tend to consider that context is key to understand and relate to a story.**\n\nI don’t think pseudonymity or anonymity are solutions to polarization, no. The desire for pseudonymity may never reach a critical mass. Many people will still want to have their real identities out in the world. But it doesn’t need to be binary. Just like what we see with Finsta these days, many people are likely to keep their true identity online while going pseudonymous for specific facets of their life.\n\n**Time will tell! Also, this conversation went even deeper than what I initially thought. So thanks a lot Fadeke, it was a pleasure to learn more about your approach behind your fantastic articles. I can’t wait to see which new cultures you’ll explore next with Cybernaut. Take care!**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RycUCZDipLjiLdqd8qKOy.gif?height=270&width=500)\n\n### 4 interesting corners of the internet, curated by Fadeke:\n\n* **[#PrisonTok](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/prisontok?lang=en)** : *“TikTok is one of my favorite platforms because we often see and hear from “unlikely creators” –– from blue collar workers cleaning pools for a living or people residing (mostly) off-grid in remote parts of Hawaii or The Yukon. #PrisonTok (or #JailTok) lets users hear from people we rarely get to: the incarcerated population. Getting an unvarnished look into life inside, outside television or a documentary, is one of the more interesting sections of TikTok.”*\n* **[KnowYourMeme](https://knowyourmeme.com/)** : *“KnowYourMeme is one of the most impressive encyclopedias of popular internet culture that exists today. If you’re online and feel you’re outside the sphere of understanding the inside joke of the week, there’s a great chance it’s been documented on the site. Some recent favorites include “[Spent All Last Night Crying About The Wage Gap (I'm 6'3\" BTW)](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/spent-all-last-night-crying-about-the-wage-gap-im-63-btw)” and “[Violation Of My HIPAA Rights](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/violation-of-my-hipaa-rights).”*\n* **[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)** : *“The Internet Archive is a super impressive digital library that often lets you take a peek into early internet culture if you know where to look. The tag “[computermagazines](https://archive.org/details/computermagazines)” often yields some interesting gems including early editions of publications like PC Magazine and MacWorld.”*\n* **[NoSurf](https://nosurf.net/)** : *“The ubiquity of the internet inevitably means some people want to escape it. NoSurf is an interesting movement, which includes online communities across Discord and a Subreddit, where people seek support on disconnecting from the web and living fuller lives offline.

Los NFTs han surgido como consecuencia del **desarrollo tecnológico** de la humanidad e involucra preguntas sobre el **presente, el futuro** y en ese sentido muchas de las **respuestas están en el pasado**, repasando la historia.\n\nIncluso para aquellos que ya tengan en mayor o menor medida alguna comprensión del término es probable que se encuentren con **la difícil tarea** de intentar explicar en palabras sencillas algo que ya veremos si se convierte en un **fenómeno complejo** con la capacidad de impactar todo ámbito de la experiencia humana.\n\nEn ese sentido me voy a centrar en exponer de forma resumida qué es un **Token No fungible o Non Fungible Token** — NFT por sus siglas en ingles.\n\n## Por qué Fungible?\n\n![BTC/ETH](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*6kkAedTUE1Jw0rR4ANqAng.jpeg)\n\nEn principio es necesario tener en cuenta lo que significa **“fungible”**, desde un punto de vista monetario, es la propiedad que tiene el dinero de por ejemplo, ser intercambiado 1:1, es decir, **1$ dólar por 1$ dólar**. Lo mismo ocurre con **Bitcoin** dado que de los **21 millones de Bitcoin**s que existen en total todos son **igualmente equivalentes entre sí.**\n\nPor lo tanto, al contrario de las cripto-monedas, los NFT son **No Fungibles** y esto implica que cada NFT representa una **garantía de propiedad única** digital en forma de token encriptado que es **registrado en la cadena de bloques (blockchain)**. Lo que significa que todo activo tokenizado o NFT queda sujeto a un **dueño único**, asociado a una **billetera personal**, que puede ser **verificable en la cadena de bloques** de la red (**[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/)**) donde se encuentra alojado el activo, asegurado por un **contrato digital.**\n\n## Verificación de Autenticidad y Certificado de Propiedad\n\n![Profesor Elon Rocket Factory (PERF) NFT #1373](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M8Cl5F8V3YOCQtcXSWmVM.jpg?height=2000&width=2000)\n\nEsto quiere decir que ahora se puede realizar seguimiento dentro de un registro público digital sobre los activos que existen en el mundo físico como por ejemplo: Desde bienes raíces hasta obras de arte, productos (Merch) de artistas, [álbumes de música](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/arts/music/wu-tang-clan-once-upon-a-time-in-shaolin.html), donaciones. Todo lo que implique una transacción o intercambio ya sea de un bien o un servicio **puede ser verificado por la red.**\n\nDesde el aspecto cultural relacionado a las artes o a la música representa la posibilidad de **vencer a la piratearía de contenido,** también da la posibilidad de verificar la autenticidad del trabajo creativo de cualquier persona y así como también **salvaguardar su propiedad intelectual.**\n\nSumado a lo anterior esto también permite a los artistas **manejar su trabajo de manera independiente** sin necesidad de terceras personas o instituciones (third party) quienes se encargan de validar a dichos artistas como relevantes o no, es decir, las grandes galerías y museos o las compañías de música que mantienen el **monopolio del contenido.**\n\n## NFT, Comunidad y Descentralización\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*jCxJcrR2-GPuw-m9eybnAQ.jpeg)\n\nAnte la innovación que representa la posibilidad de contar con un medio para **verificar y certificar activos** y objetos de creación y uso humano como el arte, la música o los bienes raíces, esto implica un cambio directo en la forma en la que se **intercambia valor** por las actividades creativas y por todo aquello que es de utilidad para la sociedad.\n\nPor otro lado, los NFTs también cuentan con la cualidad de funcionar como una llave de entrada o una manera de **identificar a cada individuo como miembro** de una comunidad lo que abre un sin fin de posibilidades para la manera en la que los humanos del presente y el futuro se pueden organizar en grupos e interactuar entre sí.\n\nQuizá esto permita **nuevas maneras de gobernanza** donde cada individuo al ser verificado e identificado dentro de cada comunidad donde se desenvuelve a través de un token digital como **miembro activo de dicha comunidad. Esto se puede traducir en nuevos sistemas de votación** y por ende mayor descentralización ya que cada NFT dentro de un ecosistema podría ser equivalente a un voto dentro de una **[organización descentralizada](https://101blockchains.com/define-dao-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/)**.\n\n## Mainstream NFTs\n\n![Reese Witherspoon Tweet sobre la compra de su primer NFT](https://miro.medium.com/max/1216/1\\*tGTHCW12wwQ9dM5bsvV3LA.png)\n\nA pesar de que es algo nuevo estando hoy en el (Q4) de 2021 es un fenómeno que como buen producto del desarrollo tecnológico y la era digital, se despliega rápido y su **adopción masiva** parece que en comparación con tecnologías e innovaciones previas será tan rápido que las personas harán uso de ellos sin siquiera percatarse.\n\nCuando artistas y deportistas como [Sharika](https://www.instagram.com/p/CULLYI4ML9C/), [Maluma](https://ethernitychain.medium.com/ethernity-chain-presents-icon-x-maluma-e8c94e4e9692), [Messi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSpTr6Yplqs&ab_channel=EthernityChain),[ Shaquille O’Neal](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/04/shaq-to-release-nft-collection/) o [Ressee Witherspoon](https://twitter.com/ReeseW/status/1447608205224316931) con millones de seguidores se unen a la fiebre por los NFTs puede que sea un indicio de que **algo está pasando.**\n\n## The Future Ahora\n\n![The Future is Now](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*dPIRMG1PE6i79CpRN41CDw.jpeg)\n\nEl futuro esta ocurriendo ante nuestros ojos, vivimos en un mundo donde todo transcurre muy rápido, la información vuela y muchas veces nos vemos **saturados de información.** De todas maneras, nada se detiene, el progreso y el desarrollo tecnológico es **cada vez más acelerado.**\n\nPor su naturaleza innovadora es un entorno donde todos los actores están **aprendiendo sobre la marcha y todo ocurre a una velocidad acelerada.**\n\n## Tecnología en Desarrollo\n\nUn tecnología en desarrollo que **influye sobre comunidades diversas** y no sólo de la industria del arte o deportes, sino tecnología, gaming, redes sociales, el diseño, la música y así **casi cualquier aspecto de la vida humana.**\n\nAsí que acompáñenme a hacerle seguimiento a lo ocurre dentro de este espacio que **recién empieza** y que se puede **construir en conjunto.**\n\n## *Nota: Este articulo no tiene intención de servir como consejo financiero.

{"id": "EC_BAZDn5MMuB38CRzQZUcgbeCUQbAgV0wPtbSq_ATI", "title": "Technology for a Better Future by DanteAC | Oct 2021 |Medium", "body": "![Better Future](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*h1gX100wvdY2xde6WwpYXg.jpeg)\n\n## Exchange, Interaction, and Development\n\nThe development of human civilization has as one of its foundations the ability to communicate and interact with each other, the use of symbols followed by the development of common languages allows the exchange of value between humans, following a set of rules that can be imposed ([Authoritarian](https://www.significados.com/autoritarismo/)) or deliberate ([Consensus](https://dle.rae.es/consenso)) enabling the organization of diverse groups working together, where each individual makes a specific contribution product of their effort that translates into value for the collective.\n\nThis progress as a whole is what allows us today to have technology that makes it possible to enjoy drinking water, electric lighting, public services, the internet, smartphones, and everything that facilitates human processes. This is the result of endless trial and error, achieving the most accelerated technological development in history, reaching an unprecedented exponential growth.\n\n![Industrial Development](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*mkzj57LXHLEXHvPZqOd7vA.jpeg)\n\n## Collective Know-How\n\nMore than 200 years have passed since the [1st industrial revolution](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revoluci%C3%B3n_Industrial), this means that by the year 2021 while we are going through the [first great pandemic](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) of the new millennium, 100 years since the last pandemic of similar magnitude as the [Spanish flu](https://enciclopediadehistoria.com/gripe-espanola/#:\\~:text=%C2%BFQu%C3%A9%20fue%20la%20gripe%20espa%C3%B1ola%3F%20La%20gripe%20espa%C3%B1ola,provoc%C3%B3%20la%20muerte%20de%20alrededor%20de%2050%20millones.), today we are in the 4th industrial revolution and perhaps heading towards the [5th industrial revolution](https://www.fingent.com/blog/how-the-5th-industrial-revolution-is-advancing-humanity-at-workplace/).\n\nThe transmission of knowledge is a process that takes time to be expressed in practice, this not only happens with individuals, but it is also the same for society, culture, and humanity as a whole. The first thinkers/scientists such as Socrates, Aristotle, Copernicus, Newton, Einstein, Hawking, or Elon Musk all have been influenced by their predecessors.\n\nIn that sense the know-how has been accumulating in humanity expressed in the development of our environment, today we have tools that allow almost anyone with internet access to take an online course and begin to immediately apply the knowledge just acquired. Not only this but also the possibility of sharing it in real-time thanks to social networks.\n\nThis represents an unprecedented possibility, being the reason why knowhow is important, understood as an indicator to determine the development referred to the implementation of the acquired knowledge of a group or collective that are transmitted from generation to generation and are the origin of the creation of products of value for society and therefore of complex productive chains and therefore greater development.\n\n![Collective Knowhow](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*vtC76ma0zXF04guCg0FTKw.jpeg)\n\n## Knowledge Communities\n\nNowadays, human beings require the contribution of applied knowledge from each individual for their development. In this sense, social networks provide the means to disseminate this knowledge in real-time to be consumed, assimilated, recycled, and shared. This opens the possibility that communities of knowledge that are organized through platforms such as twitter, reddit, or discord can produce objects of value for society and exchange them directly among themselves, as well as between communities.\n\nIn this way, each member of the community has the possibility of contributing, acquiring, and exchanging not only ideas but also the product of their work for goods and services that are in turn provided by other members of the community. Of course, this varies depending on the interest or motive under which the group has been created, taking into account that different types of communities can interact with each other, without having mutually exclusive interests.\n\n![What’s Next](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*FWwrMM25cmEyt-Lw26CXHg.jpeg)\n\n## The Better Future\n\nThe emergence of new technologies that have facilitated communication between humans and entire communities, in conjunction with the development of the digital space, contains the potential to allow groups with specific knowledge to interact with each other, exchanging value, all of this being verified within the digital environment while occurring in the physical realm.\n\nBy making use of smart contracts secured on the network ([Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/)) any type of transaction between two individuals can be verified (Blockchain), this also applies to broad groups of people such as the transactions of a business premises, an artist’s community, a scientific group, a municipality and even a country.\n\nThis can represent the use of technology to innovate the way humans establish groups, create new voting systems with greater transparency, and even have the potential to keep humanity connected for the common good, each individual contributing from their niche of knowledge.\n\nInstead of making use of social networks and technology to escape reality, it would be the use of such applied knowledge to the renewal and innovation of the ways of interaction of humanity, groups, society, the conformation of governments, thus making more complex but at the same time decentralized and transparent the exchange of value between humans.\n\n## Note: This article is not intended to serve as financial advice.

Lo anterior como resultado de un sin fin de pruebas y errores, logrando el desarrollo tecnológico más acelerado de la historia, hasta alcanzar en el presente un crecimiento exponencial sin precedentes.\n\n![Desarrollo Industrial](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CCnJAhW8ISlwT4g9O1hm_.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\n## Saber Hacer Colectivo\n\nHan pasado más de 200 años desde la 1ra [revolución industrial](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revoluci%C3%B3n_Industrial), esto quiere decir que para el año 2021 mientras atravesamos la [primera gran pandemia](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) del nuevo milenio, 100 años desde la ultima pandemia de magnitudes similares como fue la [gripe española](https://enciclopediadehistoria.com/gripe-espanola/#:\\~:text=%C2%BFQu%C3%A9%20fue%20la%20gripe%20espa%C3%B1ola%3F%20La%20gripe%20espa%C3%B1ola,provoc%C3%B3%20la%20muerte%20de%20alrededor%20de%2050%20millones.), hoy nos encontramos en la 4ta revolución industrial y quizá dirigidos hacia la [5ta revolución industrial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L43Np8B9xK0&ab_channel=TEDxTalks)\n\nLa transmisión del conocimiento es un proceso que toma tiempo para verse expresado en la práctica, esto no solo ocurre con los individuos, es igual para la sociedad, la cultura y la humanidad como un todo. Desde los primeros pensadores/científicos como Sócrates, Aristóteles, pasando por Copérnico, Newton, Einstein, Hawking o Elon Musk todos se han visto influenciados por sus antecesores.\n\nEn ese sentido el saber hacer (Knowhow) se ha ido acumulando en la humanidad expresado en el desarrollo de nuestro entorno, hoy contamos con herramientas que permiten que casi cualquier persona con acceso a internet pueda tomar un curso en línea y comenzar a aplicar de forma inmediata el conocimiento que recién adquirió. No solo esto, sino que además cuenta con la posibilidad de compartirlo en tiempo real gracias a las redes sociales.\n\nEsto representa una posibilidad sin precedentes siendo la razón por la cual es importante el saber hacer ([knowhow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L43Np8B9xK0&ab_channel=TEDxTalks)), entendido como un indicador para determinar el desarrollo referido a la puesta en práctica de los conocimientos adquiridos de un grupo o el colectivo que se transmiten de generación en generación y son el origen de la creación de productos de valor para la sociedad y por lo tanto de cadenas productivas complejas y por ende mayor desarrollo.\n\n![Saber Hacer Colectivo](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*vtC76ma0zXF04guCg0FTKw.jpeg)\n\n# Comunidades de Conocimiento\n\nEn la actualidad el ser humano requiere del aporte del conocimiento aplicado de cada individuo para su desarrollo, en ese sentido, con las redes sociales se dispone de medios para difundir dicho conocimiento en tiempo real para ser consumido, asimilado, reciclado y compartido. Esto abre la posibilidad a que comunidades de conocimiento que se organizan a través de plataformas como twitter, reddit o discord puedan producir objetos de valor para la sociedad e intercambiarlos directamente entre sí, así como entre comunidades.\n\nDe está manera cada miembro de la comunidad tiene la posibilidad de aportar, adquirir e intercambiar no solo ideas, también puede ser el producto de su trabajo por bienes y/o servicios que a su vez son prestados por otros miembros de la comunidad. Por su puesto, esto varia dependiendo del interés o motivo bajo el cual el grupo se ha creado, a su vez, tomando en cuenta que diversos tipos de comunidades pueden interactuar entre sí, sin que hayan intereses excluyentes entre sí.\n\n![El Porvenir](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*FWwrMM25cmEyt-Lw26CXHg.jpeg)\n\n## El Futuro Mejor\n\nEl surgimiento de nuevas tecnologías que han facilitado la comunicación entre seres humanos y comunidades enteras, en conjunto con el desarrollo del espacio digital, contiene el potencial de permitir que agrupaciones con conocimientos específicos interactúen entre sí, intercambiando valor, todo esto siendo verificado dentro del entorno digital mientras ocurre en el ámbito físico.\n\nHaciendo uso de contratos inteligentes asegurados en la red ([Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/)) se puede verificar (Cadena de bloques) cualquier tipo de transacción entre dos individuos, esto también aplica para amplios grupos de personas como pueden ser las transacciones de un local comercial, la comunidad de un artista, un grupo científico, un municipio e incluso un país.\n\nEsto puede representar el uso de la tecnología para innovar la manera en la que los humanos establecen grupos, crear nuevos sistema de votación con mayor transparencia e incluso cuenta con el potencial de mantener a la humanidad conectada por el bien común, cada individuo aportando desde su nicho de conocimiento.\n\nEn vez de hacer uso de las redes sociales y la tecnología para escapar de la realidad, seria el uso de dicho conocimiento aplicado para la renovación e innovación de las maneras de interacción de la humanidad, los grupos, la sociedad, la conformación de gobiernos, haciendo así mas complejo pero al mismo tiempo descentralizado y transparente el intercambio de valor entre humanos.\n\n## Nota: Este articulo no tiene intención de servir como consejo financiero.

Los NFTs han surgido como consecuencia del **desarrollo tecnológico** de la humanidad e involucra preguntas sobre el **presente, el futuro** y en ese sentido muchas de las **respuestas están en el pasado**, repasando la historia.\n\nIncluso para aquellos que ya tengan en mayor o menor medida alguna comprensión del término es probable que se encuentren con **la difícil tarea** de intentar explicar en palabras sencillas algo que ya veremos si se convierte en un **fenómeno complejo** con la capacidad de impactar todo ámbito de la experiencia humana.\n\nEn ese sentido me voy a centrar en exponer de forma resumida qué es un **Token No fungible o Non Fungible Token** — NFT por sus siglas en ingles.\n\n## Por qué Fungible?\n\n![BTC/ETH](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*6kkAedTUE1Jw0rR4ANqAng.jpeg)\n\nEn principio es necesario tener en cuenta lo que significa **“fungible”**, desde un punto de vista monetario, es la propiedad que tiene el dinero de por ejemplo, ser intercambiado 1:1, es decir, **1$ dólar por 1$ dólar**. Lo mismo ocurre con **Bitcoin** dado que de los **21 millones de Bitcoin**s que existen en total todos son **igualmente equivalentes entre sí.**\n\nPor lo tanto, al contrario de las cripto-monedas, los NFT son **No Fungibles** y esto implica que cada NFT representa una **garantía de propiedad única** digital en forma de token encriptado que es **registrado en la cadena de bloques (blockchain)**. Lo que significa que todo activo tokenizado o NFT queda sujeto a un **dueño único**, asociado a una **billetera personal**, que puede ser **verificable en la cadena de bloques** de la red (**[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/)**) donde se encuentra alojado el activo, asegurado por un **contrato digital.**\n\n## Verificación de Autenticidad y Certificado de Propiedad\n\n![Profesor Elon Rocket Factory (PERF) NFT #1373](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M8Cl5F8V3YOCQtcXSWmVM.jpg?height=2000&width=2000)\n\nEsto quiere decir que ahora se puede realizar seguimiento dentro de un registro público digital sobre los activos que existen en el mundo físico como por ejemplo: Desde bienes raíces hasta obras de arte, productos (Merch) de artistas, [álbumes de música](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/arts/music/wu-tang-clan-once-upon-a-time-in-shaolin.html), donaciones. Todo lo que implique una transacción o intercambio ya sea de un bien o un servicio **puede ser verificado por la red.**\n\nDesde el aspecto cultural relacionado a las artes o a la música representa la posibilidad de **vencer a la piratearía de contenido,** también da la posibilidad de verificar la autenticidad del trabajo creativo de cualquier persona y así como también **salvaguardar su propiedad intelectual.**\n\nSumado a lo anterior esto también permite a los artistas **manejar su trabajo de manera independiente** sin necesidad de terceras personas o instituciones (third party) quienes se encargan de validar a dichos artistas como relevantes o no, es decir, las grandes galerías y museos o las compañías de música que mantienen el **monopolio del contenido.**\n\n## NFT, Comunidad y Descentralización\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*jCxJcrR2-GPuw-m9eybnAQ.jpeg)\n\nAnte la innovación que representa la posibilidad de contar con un medio para **verificar y certificar activos** y objetos de creación y uso humano como el arte, la música o los bienes raíces, esto implica un cambio directo en la forma en la que se **intercambia valor** por las actividades creativas y por todo aquello que es de utilidad para la sociedad.\n\nPor otro lado, los NFTs también cuentan con la cualidad de funcionar como una llave de entrada o una manera de **identificar a cada individuo como miembro** de una comunidad lo que abre un sin fin de posibilidades para la manera en la que los humanos del presente y el futuro se pueden organizar en grupos e interactuar entre sí.\n\nQuizá esto permita **nuevas maneras de gobernanza** donde cada individuo al ser verificado e identificado dentro de cada comunidad donde se desenvuelve a través de un token digital como **miembro activo de dicha comunidad. Esto se puede traducir en nuevos sistemas de votación** y por ende mayor descentralización ya que cada NFT dentro de un ecosistema podría ser equivalente a un voto dentro de una **[organización descentralizada](https://101blockchains.com/define-dao-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/)**.\n\n## Mainstream NFTs\n\n![Reese Witherspoon Tweet sobre la compra de su primer NFT](https://miro.medium.com/max/1216/1\\*tGTHCW12wwQ9dM5bsvV3LA.png)\n\nA pesar de que es algo nuevo estando hoy en el (Q4) de 2021 es un fenómeno que como buen producto del desarrollo tecnológico y la era digital, se despliega rápido y su **adopción masiva** parece que en comparación con tecnologías e innovaciones previas será tan rápido que las personas harán uso de ellos sin siquiera percatarse.\n\nCuando artistas y deportistas como [Sharika](https://www.instagram.com/p/CULLYI4ML9C/), [Maluma](https://ethernitychain.medium.com/ethernity-chain-presents-icon-x-maluma-e8c94e4e9692), [Messi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSpTr6Yplqs&ab_channel=EthernityChain),[ Shaquille O’Neal](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/04/shaq-to-release-nft-collection/) o [Ressee Witherspoon](https://twitter.com/ReeseW/status/1447608205224316931) con millones de seguidores se unen a la fiebre por los NFTs puede que sea un indicio de que **algo está pasando.**\n\n## The Future Ahora\n\n![The Future is Now](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*dPIRMG1PE6i79CpRN41CDw.jpeg)\n\nEl futuro esta ocurriendo ante nuestros ojos, vivimos en un mundo donde todo transcurre muy rápido, la información vuela y muchas veces nos vemos **saturados de información.** De todas maneras, nada se detiene, el progreso y el desarrollo tecnológico es **cada vez más acelerado.**\n\nPor su naturaleza innovadora es un entorno donde todos los actores están **aprendiendo sobre la marcha y todo ocurre a una velocidad acelerada.**\n\n## Tecnología en Desarrollo\n\nUn tecnología en desarrollo que **influye sobre comunidades diversas** y no sólo de la industria del arte o deportes, sino tecnología, gaming, redes sociales, el diseño, la música y así **casi cualquier aspecto de la vida humana.**\n\nAsí que acompáñenme a hacerle seguimiento a lo ocurre dentro de este espacio que **recién empieza** y que se puede **construir en conjunto.**\n\n## *Nota: Este articulo no tiene intención de servir como consejo financiero.

{"id": "Sd51wtKxx5yiOF9pN070SBfFe3cqNXKUn4FDGTBpluM", "title": "What is a NFT?", "body": "![Digital Evolution](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*FmA1ow4X7rVeCS9lBNhe_w.jpeg)\n\nThis is a question that many people are asking at the moment and the interest is just going to increase through time. NFTs have arisen as a consequence of the technological development of mankind and involve questions about the present, the future and in that sense many of the answers are in the past, going back in history.\n\nEven for those who already have to a greater or lesser extent some understanding of the term, it is likely that they will be faced with the difficult task of trying to explain in simple words something that we will see if it becomes a complex phenomenon with the ability to impact every area of human experience.\n\n## Why Fungible?\n\n![BTC/ETH](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*6kkAedTUE1Jw0rR4ANqAng.jpeg)\n\nI will focus on summarizing what is a Non Fungible Token — NFT.\n\nFirst of all, it is necessary to take into account what “fungible” means, from a monetary point of view, it is the property that money has of, for example, being exchanged 1:1, i.e. $1 dollar for $1 dollar. The same is true of Bitcoin since of the 21 million Bitcoins that exist in total all are equally equivalent to each other.\n\nTherefore, unlike cryptocurrencies, NFTs are Non-Fungible and this implies that each NFT represents a guarantee of unique digital property in the form of an encrypted token that is registered in the blockchain. What this means is that every tokenized asset or NFT is subject to a unique owner, associated with a personal wallet, which can be verified on the blockchain of the network [(Ethereum)](https://ethereum.org/en/) where the asset is hosted, secured by a digital contract.\n\n## Verification of Authenticity and Certificate of Ownership\n\n![Profesor Elon Rocket Factory (PERF) NFT #1373](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*y8druaUabydy2j0VrmayJw.jpeg)\n\nThis means that any existing asset in the physical world can now be tracked in a digital public record, for example: from real estate, artwork, artists merchandise, [music albums](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/arts/music/wu-tang-clan-once-upon-a-time-in-shaolin.html), donations. Everything that involves a transaction or exchange of either a good or service can be verified by the network.\n\nFrom the cultural aspect related to the arts or music, it represents the possibility of defeating the piracy of content, it also gives the possibility of verifying the authenticity of the creative work of any person as well as safeguarding their intellectual property.\n\nIn addition to the above, this also allows artists to manage their work independently without the need of third parties who are in charge of validating the artists as relevant or not, i.e. the big galleries and museums or the music companies that hold the monopoly of the content.\n\n## NFT, Community and Decentralization\n\n![Networking Communities](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*jCxJcrR2-GPuw-m9eybnAQ.jpeg)\n\nThe innovation lies in the possibility of verifying and certifying assets of human creation such as art, music, or real estate and any exchange that occurs as a result of the interaction between two people, this implies a direct change in the way in which value is exchanged for creative activities and for everything that is useful to society.\n\nOn the other hand, NFTs also have the quality of functioning as an entry key or a way to identify each individual as a member of a community, which opens endless possibilities for the way in which present and future humans can organize themselves into groups and interact with each other.\n\nPerhaps this will allow for new ways of governance where each individual can be verified and identified within each community through a digital token as an active member of that community. This can be translated into new voting systems and therefore greater decentralization since each NFT within an ecosystem could be equivalent to a vote within a [decentralized organization](https://101blockchains.com/define-dao-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/).\n\n## Mainstream NFTs\n\n![Reese Witherspoon Tweet about buying her first NFT](https://miro.medium.com/max/1216/1\\*tGTHCW12wwQ9dM5bsvV3LA.png)\n\nAlthough it is something new today in (Q4) 2021 it is a phenomenon that as a good product of technological development and the digital era, it is deploying fast and its massive adoption seems that compared to previous technologies and innovations will be so fast that people will make use of them without even realizing it.\n\nWhen artists and athletes like [Sharika](https://www.instagram.com/p/CULLYI4ML9C/), [Maluma](https://ethernitychain.medium.com/ethernity-chain-presents-icon-x-maluma-e8c94e4e9692), [Messi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSpTr6Yplqs&ab_channel=EthernityChain), [Shaquille O’Neal](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/04/shaq-to-release-nft-collection/), or [Ressee Witherspoon](https://twitter.com/ReeseW/status/1447608205224316931) with millions of followers join the fever for NFTs it may be an indication that something is happening.\n\n## The Future Now\n\n![The Future is Now](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*dPIRMG1PE6i79CpRN41CDw.jpeg)\n\nThe future is happening before our eyes, we live in a world where everything happens very fast, information flies, and many times we are saturated with information. However, nothing stands still, progress and technological development is increasingly accelerated.\n\nBecause of its innovative nature, it is an environment where all actors are learning on the fly and everything happens at an accelerated speed.\n\n## Developing Technology\n\nDeveloping technology that influences diverse communities and not just in the art or sports industry, but technology, gaming, social networking, design, music and almost any aspect of human life.\n\nSo join me in following what is happening in this space that is just beginning and can be built together.\n\n## Note: This article is not intended to serve as financial advice.

{"id": "uuCRNIFZlp3hzeE2KtQnRPB1TPAyE4AVLHbleJOuePk", "title": "Parasocial Activity — my interview with Fadeke Adegbuyi", "body": "> **This interview was first published in [Plumes With Attitude](https://plumeswithattitude.substack.com/) ( 🇫🇷 ), my personal newsletter on the benefits of writing, on August, 2021.**\n\n*[Fadeke Adegbuyi](https://twitter.com/fadeke_adegbuyi) is the author of [Cybernaut](https://every.to/cybernaut), a newsletter on the many faces of internet culture that is part of the [Every](https://every.to/) bundle. She’s become a master at observing some of our strangest behaviours online while covering the deepest corners of the web. As a big fan of her writings, I had a lot of questions about her methods, analyses and findings. Below is the recap of our conversation.*\n\n**Note:** This interview was recorded on October 5th, 2021.\n\n![Fadeke Adegbuyi, author of Cybernaut](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mfdYlBJSWeGHD3_7mA3oD.jpeg?height=3150&width=3150)\n\n**Hi Fadeke, thanks for accepting my invitation! As a loyal [Cybernaut](https://every.to/cybernaut) reader, I’m happy to have you here to talk about your experience building this awesome publication. Before launching the newsletter with the Every collective, you worked on content marketing at Doist. During my research for this interview, I also realized that you wrote the fantastic [Holloway Guide To Using Twitter](https://www.holloway.com/g/using-twitter) that I have recommended a lot in my newsletter. You were initially focused more on actionable content than in-depth analyses of internet cultures. So I was wondering: how did it all start for Cybernaut?**\n\nWorking at Doist helped me fall in love with long-form writing. Our pieces on remote work or productivity were anywhere between 2500 and 6000 words –– not your typical content marketing. Besides that, I’ve always been interested in technology’s impact on society. Hence the idea of Cybernaut: a newsletter with long-form essays exploring how people and platforms interact with one another. I wanted to write about how platforms shape people and vice versa. These are phenomenons I read a lot about and get the chance to observe within online communities. My goal with Cybernaut is diving into internet culture topics and spending time cataloging and discussing what I find.\n\n**And you do it wonderfully! I shared several Cybernaut articles in the newsletter and [the one on LinkedIn](https://every.to/cybernaut/linkedins-alternate-universe-21780381-7883) is probably the funniest take I’ve read this year. Before digging your (vast) topic of predilection together, I wanted to ask you: what is exactly “internet culture”? And does it concern everybody online or just some of us?**\n\nInternet culture has a ton of different definitions. It’s often associated with Gen Z but I consider it much broader than that. There was briefly a solid line between “real life” and whatever happens online. But since everything we do is embedded within the web, internet culture has simply become culture itself. We can't escape it.\n\nFor instance, it was so interesting to see the response and discussion while Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp were down \\[the day before the interview\\]. The noticeable difference we experience when these platforms are gone reveals the huge facets of our lives they represent. The reactions on Twitter yesterday showed an interesting aspect of internet culture: what happens when some of the sites that we rely on are no longer available to us?\n\n**The good news for you is, internet culture seems an endless source of inspiration for your writings. So far you have covered topics like parasocial relationships, online fandom, and the hustle narrative. How do you pick the topics you write about? And what’s your approach to analyzing the cultures you choose?**\n\nI read a lot online and tend to fall down rabbit holes. When I notice an interesting trend or phenomenon, I often want to know where it starts and where it ends. So I just keep digging. For instance, my article on the [Study Web](https://every.to/cybernaut/caught-in-the-study-web) was born out of seeing a lot of study content on TikTok. I was familiar with such content on YouTube and I wanted to see differences with platforms like Reddit and Discord. I found out that there are so many corners of the internet where students are relying on one another to succeed at school. There is also a lot of pressure and anxiety around achievement. Of course, it’s a phenomenon that has accelerated because of the pandemic. It would have been much harder to analyze this if students were on campus instead of all being online.\n\nSo digging and observing is stage one. But if I am actually decided on writing on a topic, then I'll go further. I reach out to people within those communities to see if they're willing to chat and give me more insight. I recently [wrote a piece about anti-fandoms](https://every.to/cybernaut/the-anti-fan-phenomenon), that is communities where people bond over the common practice of loving to hate on public figures. I found the phenomenon bizarre –– I didn't understand it on the surface because I couldn't imagine myself or people I know doing this.\n\nSo I really wanted to speak to people within the community and ask what they find so captivating about these spaces. I managed to talk to three people within a particular community, Gossip Gate, that was dedicated to hating a wide array of influencers. I discovered they had actually been true fans of the influencers at one point. They somehow became disenchanted along the way and considered these spaces as a form of entertainment. So you can’t just observe such phenomenons and hope to understand without having any interactions with the community.\n\n**This explains how you manage to keep a certain neutrality by not being judgemental in your writings. And yet, some traits of the cultures you observe can appear as cringe, shallow, ridiculous or even depressing. Still, you introduce yourself as a “tech optimist” in your Twitter bio. What makes you feel that way about the Internet?**\n\nI believe that technology has a positive impact on the world –– which is not to say that it can't have a negative one. I'm hopeful that the next generation of technologists will have a more mindful approach to shaping online experiences for all. Most people act with good intent –– I think it’s true for most founders building tech companies and most people interacting with others online. Of course, there are bad actors. But I don't think that is the majority.\n\nI live in the grey. This probably reflects in my writings. When I [wrote about Clubhouse](https://every.to/cybernaut/cashing-in-on-clubhouse), it was a time when people were quite critical of the platform and describing it as a failed experiment. While I thought there were some changes that made the app less spontaneous and interesting, I really enjoyed my time on Clubhouse. Bringing people together through the medium of voice is definitely an interesting and intimate experience. I didn’t want to write another take just for the sake of bashing the app –– even though it would have probably garnered more attention and engagement.\n\n**Traditional media are often merciless regarding Big Tech. Today, it just seems inconceivable to read a single positive article about companies like Facebook or Google in the press. Do you think that all the negative coverage on these platforms is always justified?**\n\nIt's interesting that you ask that on the day after Facebook went down. People around the world lost connectivity to their friends and family because WhatsApp was unavailable. It’s a massive medium of communication, especially in developing countries where it is a pillar for both individuals and small businesses.\n\nIn many ways, Facebook has had a positive impact on the world. But that doesn’t make them above scrutiny or criticism. Recently, the company made headlines regarding their own findings regarding how Instagram may impact the mental health of young users. It’s worthwhile for the press to dig into things like that.\n\nOn the other hand, the tech press is not above criticism either. There are many instances where outlets are not discerning as they could (and should) be. It’s more important than ever to have real debates that address nuance and complexity rather than simply pointing fingers.\n\n**Speaking of this, what are some of the issues on the Internet that strike you most?**\n\nI’m interested in how algorithms can drive human behaviour. For instance, their capacity to magnify and amplify highly engaging content – sometimes for the better and very often for the worse – is something I think about a lot. On Twitter, it’s always concerning to see someone’s name trending, often for some minor non-offense, that leads to pile-ons and harassment that in many ways feel sanctioned by the platform and become a common behaviour.\n\nIt’s also interesting how people “hack” algorithms. There is this meme called [Soylent Grin](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/soy-boy-face-soyjak) referring to a particular facial expression where people have their mouth wide open, looking shocked. You might have noticed that in many YouTube thumbnails –– it’s “thumbnail face”.\n\nThere’s a great video on the Veritasium YouTube channel on the [effectiveness of clickbait](https://youtu.be/S2xHZPH5Sng), that discusses how important thumbnails are to creators garnering clicks. The algorithm learns a behaviour that generates more clicks and boosts videos with that attribute. As a result, creators took notice and suddenly everyone was doing the Soylent Grin. I think that's an interesting example to illustrate how algorithms can drive behaviour.\n\nThis phenomenon is even more evident on TikTok. Fashion trends proliferate overnight because of viral TikTok videos. That's what I mean when I say that the frontier between internet culture and IRL culture has been shrinking.\n\n**Among the different internet cultures that you have observed so far, which one do you think was the most fascinating?**\n\nI've been thinking a lot about [parasocial relationships](https://every.to/cybernaut/the-blurred-lines-of-parasocial-relationships) after my series of articles on the subject in Cybernaut. It’s a term that was coined in 1956 by Donald Horton and Richard Wohl. They initially described the bonds that TV viewers developed with movie screen actors. But since the rise of the internet, and especially social media, we've just seen these relationships proliferate and soar online.\n\nToday, internet creators are very intimately tied with their audiences. After all, they often speak directly to them through the camera. Influencers show who they are by streaming their private life. They are showing their morning routine, going grocery shopping, spending the weekends with their family members at barbecues. So they give true insight into their lives. This level of access to someone’s life is much deeper than with an actor simply doing their job. Going forward, I think it’s a very important phenomenon to keep an eye on.\n\n**But I’m wondering, aren’t we all doing that on TikTok or Instagram? It’s probably a chicken and egg dilemma, but do you explain parasocial relationships by the fact that we all behave like influencers online or by the fact that influencers just act like everyone?**\n\nThat's an interesting question. We live in an era where everyone has a personal brand, whether it’s on Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram or TikTok. We have a certain image online that can be very different from that of our personal life. On the one hand, a lot of people tend to polish their online presence to gain views, likes and influence. But on the other hand, online creators cultivate this deep intimacy with their audiences.\n\nIn the first piece that I wrote about parasocial relationships, I gave an anecdote about the two creators of my favourite podcast: Hila and Ethan Klein. During a livestream, they told their audience that Hila was pregnant right after they found it –– bypassing the customary three-month waiting period. Announcements like that are extremely intimate and many of us don't even share those details with their own friends and family. But some online creators share some of the most intimate aspects of their lives, including death, divorce, depression or miscarriage. Such close connections between people and their audience is what drives parasocial relationships today.\n\n**The funny thing is that this trend actually has an opposite with the rise of anonymity online. We can see that with “anon” accounts on Twitter or with most teenagers having a “Finsta”. According to you, what are the main consequences of having such fluid identities online?**\n\nThis is such a fascinating topic. People are complex and have some facets of their identity that they want to hide –– or not have associated with their real name or professional identity. Being able to obscure your identity online allows some people to feel more comfortable in self-expression.\n\nThere is also this whole thesis about the [pseudonymous economy](https://youtu.be/gkJqMSbI1IA) developed by Balaji Srinivasan. It's an interesting idea about potentially earning money, starting a company, and making a living online detached from your real identity using blockchain technology. I think we'll be seeing a lot more of that in the future.\n\n**There is this traditional cliche that when people behave anonymously, they will take advantage of the situation to scam or harass without consequence. But for others, concealing personal traits like your name, face or gender is precisely what prevents them from being harassed.**\n\nYes, pseudonymity can be a way for people to feel free to be themselves and speak plainly without fear of backlash — including speaking up about social issues they care about. While it can be valuable for avoiding discrimination related to your gender, race, or sexual orientation, it’s a bandaid solution.\n\n**Protecting people from being discriminated against at work remains a solid argument in favour of Balaji Srinivasan’s thesis. This reminds me of [the interview I had with Jackson Dame](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/llZnEhKaVQrxGOW2sE6aiiG3LknPy1UXJoifAXB2Mc8) two months ago, when we discussed the opportunities offered by crypto to help marginalized people build a better future for themselves. Anonymity is one of the features of Web3 that can be life-changing for underprivileged people. Another implication of Finstas and anon accounts is that still more people do have multiple social accounts – which is a big cultural shift.**\n\nExactly. And that’s a pretty big deal. Having multiple identities also means having multiple modes of expression. People get to decide which extensions of themselves they want to cultivate privately. You might have a Twitter account with your real name in which you keep things professional and tailored for your audience. And then you can run a pseudonymous account for activism, political debate, or something else entirely on the side.\n\n**Still, I think it's kind of sad that some people tend to “specialize” in social media. I tend to value online creators who act like whole persons and don’t perform a certain role to please a certain audience.**\n\nPeople often can’t deal with complexity online, there’s a desire to categorize or put things into neat boxes. It’s more challenging than ever to find nuanced discussions online or people who can hold onto more than one idea at a time. Alt accounts can help navigate this by letting people explore different ideas separately from their primary identities.\n\n**But can we truly consider that removing information by going anonymous as a viable way to fix the polarization of debates online? As a writer, I tend to consider that context is key to understand and relate to a story.**\n\nI don’t think pseudonymity or anonymity are solutions to polarization, no. The desire for pseudonymity may never reach a critical mass. Many people will still want to have their real identities out in the world. But it doesn’t need to be binary. Just like what we see with Finsta these days, many people are likely to keep their true identity online while going pseudonymous for specific facets of their life.\n\n**Time will tell!

{"id": "WMsGLDmxZdVpgeS1GKgp3TP_ChlyyAfrkRlm9AIMwm8", "title": "Tutorial: How to Provide Liquidity on Trader Joe", "body": "## What is Trader Joe?\n\n[Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/home) is a one-stop AMM decentralized trading platform on the Avalanche network. Trader Joe combines DEX services with DeFi lending to offer leveraged trading. Trader Joe’s products are community driven which allows them to give fees collected from liquidation and swaps back to the users via the JOE/xJOE staking mechanism. JOE is a governance token that also rewards its holders with a share of exchange revenues.\n\n## What is Avalanche?\n\n[Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/) is an open-source, proof-of-stake smart contracts platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications. Avalanche offers near-instant transaction finality and uses the native AVAX token to pay for gas and secure the network by staking.\n\n## What is an AMM/CFMM?\n\nCFMMs are a classification of AMMs which have been applied to crypto DeFi markets. CFMMs were pioneered by several projects in the crypto community to create decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for digital asset trading and based on a mathematical function establishing a pre-defined set of prices based on the assets held in a liquidity pool. Whereas a traditional order book-based exchanges (OBs/CLOBs), traders trade against a specific counter-party.\n\n## Why Deposit Liquidity in Trader Joe?\n\nSome investors/traders may want to Provide Liquidity (LP) in an AMM style DEX for various reasons. One popular reason is the ability to earn rewards in the native governance token of the platform. This reward structure can be used to offset a concept known as [impermanent loss (IL)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/impermanent-loss) which is when someone’s assets in a pool lose relative value when the price of one asset changes dramatically against the other asset. This concept is often referred to as [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-yield-farming) and can be done under the “Farm” tab on [Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/farm). \n\n## A step-by-step guide on how to lend assets on Trader Joe:\n\n* Visit https://traderjoexyz.com and connect your wallet.\n\n![Trader Joe Connect Wallet Pop Up](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/efB_GbeDHGtEh7AgCYgGX.png?height=1474&width=2618)\n\n* If your wallet is not on the Avalanche Network, a window will prompt you to switch to the network. Click on “Switch to Avalanche” and sign it with your wallet.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ANdLwi85qg1fFm_tZGl4D.png?height=608&width=966)\n\n* Verify the chain data is correct and click approve.\n\n![Avalanche C-Chain Details](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vcixdEM2zE6ZswaHGVZad.png?height=1464&width=944)\n\n![Switch Network to Avalanche C-Chain](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ouxa0pH0h8Yl0wl_D35wC.png?height=1464&width=944)\n\n* Once you’ve switched to the Avalanche Network, you will see your wallet address up in the top right corner of the page.\n* Now you will head over to the “Pool” tab where you can pick a pool to deposit to.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q4-Pb_FT1Bbnla9XOtEVY.png?height=1464&width=2094)\n\n* In this example I selected the “AVAX-USDT.e” pool as seen in the picture below.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/X2__-6iGxvbMaXwkfjhZc.png?height=1240&width=2020)\n\n* Depending on the amount of each token in the wallet, manually choose an amount of one token and the website will fill in the matching amount for the other token. Tip: You can use the “Max” button for the coin with the smaller dollar value.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZGu8xkIJwZpsOp7GXNmzE.png?height=972&width=736)\n\n* When you have decided the amount of each asset you would like to deposit as liquidity, you will click on the button underneath to deposit.\n* The transaction will take a few seconds to go through and once you get a confirmation screen, you can be assured your assets are now deposited into the pool of your choice!\n\n  ## Resources:\n\n  **Avalanche C-Chain Block Explorer:**\n\n  <https://cchain.explorer.avax.network/>\n\n  **Ethereum -→ Avalanche Bridge:**\n\n  <https://bridge.avax.network/login>", "timestamp": 1635957040, "digest": "X3BX21tJRxAOxD9VRHyPTGh79-fSCQ_Ffy15E8iUIgI", "contributor": "0x3eC44A823E07555B5f889d8d954eec736eb5865b"}

She’s become a master at observing some of our strangest behaviours online while covering the deepest corners of the web. As a big fan of her writings, I had a lot of questions about her methods, analyses and findings. Below is the recap of our conversation.*\n\n**Note:** This interview was recorded on October 5th, 2021.\n\n![Fadeke Adegbuyi, author of Cybernaut](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mfdYlBJSWeGHD3_7mA3oD.jpeg?height=3150&width=3150)\n\n**Hi Fadeke, thanks for accepting my invitation! As a loyal [Cybernaut](https://every.to/cybernaut) reader, I’m happy to have you here to talk about your experience building this awesome publication. Before launching the newsletter with the Every collective, you worked on content marketing at Doist. During my research for this interview, I also realized that you wrote the fantastic [Holloway Guide To Using Twitter](https://www.holloway.com/g/using-twitter) that I have recommended a lot in my newsletter. You were initially focused more on actionable content than in-depth analyses of internet cultures. So I was wondering: how did it all start for Cybernaut?**\n\nWorking at Doist helped me fall in love with long-form writing. Our pieces on remote work or productivity were anywhere between 2500 and 6000 words –– not your typical content marketing. Besides that, I’ve always been interested in technology’s impact on society. Hence the idea of Cybernaut: a newsletter with long-form essays exploring how people and platforms interact with one another. I wanted to write about how platforms shape people and vice versa. These are phenomenons I read a lot about and get the chance to observe within online communities. My goal with Cybernaut is diving into internet culture topics and spending time cataloging and discussing what I find.\n\n**And you do it wonderfully! I shared several Cybernaut articles in the newsletter and [the one on LinkedIn](https://every.to/cybernaut/linkedins-alternate-universe-21780381-7883) is probably the funniest take I’ve read this year. Before digging your (vast) topic of predilection together, I wanted to ask you: what is exactly “internet culture”? And does it concern everybody online or just some of us?**\n\nInternet culture has a ton of different definitions. It’s often associated with Gen Z but I consider it much broader than that. There was briefly a solid line between “real life” and whatever happens online. But since everything we do is embedded within the web, internet culture has simply become culture itself. We can't escape it.\n\nFor instance, it was so interesting to see the response and discussion while Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp were down \\[the day before the interview\\]. The noticeable difference we experience when these platforms are gone reveals the huge facets of our lives they represent. The reactions on Twitter yesterday showed an interesting aspect of internet culture: what happens when some of the sites that we rely on are no longer available to us?\n\n**The good news for you is, internet culture seems an endless source of inspiration for your writings. So far you have covered topics like parasocial relationships, online fandom, and the hustle narrative. How do you pick the topics you write about? And what’s your approach to analyzing the cultures you choose?**\n\nI read a lot online and tend to fall down rabbit holes. When I notice an interesting trend or phenomenon, I often want to know where it starts and where it ends. So I just keep digging. For instance, my article on the [Study Web](https://every.to/cybernaut/caught-in-the-study-web) was born out of seeing a lot of study content on TikTok. I was familiar with such content on YouTube and I wanted to see differences with platforms like Reddit and Discord. I found out that there are so many corners of the internet where students are relying on one another to succeed at school. There is also a lot of pressure and anxiety around achievement. Of course, it’s a phenomenon that has accelerated because of the pandemic. It would have been much harder to analyze this if students were on campus instead of all being online.\n\nSo digging and observing is stage one. But if I am actually decided on writing on a topic, then I'll go further. I reach out to people within those communities to see if they're willing to chat and give me more insight. I recently [wrote a piece about anti-fandoms](https://every.to/cybernaut/the-anti-fan-phenomenon), that is communities where people bond over the common practice of loving to hate on public figures. I found the phenomenon bizarre –– I didn't understand it on the surface because I couldn't imagine myself or people I know doing this.\n\nSo I really wanted to speak to people within the community and ask what they find so captivating about these spaces. I managed to talk to three people within a particular community, Gossip Gate, that was dedicated to hating a wide array of influencers. I discovered they had actually been true fans of the influencers at one point. They somehow became disenchanted along the way and considered these spaces as a form of entertainment. So you can’t just observe such phenomenons and hope to understand without having any interactions with the community.\n\n**This explains how you manage to keep a certain neutrality by not being judgemental in your writings. And yet, some traits of the cultures you observe can appear as cringe, shallow, ridiculous or even depressing. Still, you introduce yourself as a “tech optimist” in your Twitter bio. What makes you feel that way about the Internet?**\n\nI believe that technology has a positive impact on the world –– which is not to say that it can't have a negative one. I'm hopeful that the next generation of technologists will have a more mindful approach to shaping online experiences for all. Most people act with good intent –– I think it’s true for most founders building tech companies and most people interacting with others online. Of course, there are bad actors. But I don't think that is the majority.\n\nI live in the grey. This probably reflects in my writings. When I [wrote about Clubhouse](https://every.to/cybernaut/cashing-in-on-clubhouse), it was a time when people were quite critical of the platform and describing it as a failed experiment. While I thought there were some changes that made the app less spontaneous and interesting, I really enjoyed my time on Clubhouse. Bringing people together through the medium of voice is definitely an interesting and intimate experience. I didn’t want to write another take just for the sake of bashing the app –– even though it would have probably garnered more attention and engagement.\n\n**Traditional media are often merciless regarding Big Tech. Today, it just seems inconceivable to read a single positive article about companies like Facebook or Google in the press. Do you think that all the negative coverage on these platforms is always justified?**\n\nIt's interesting that you ask that on the day after Facebook went down. People around the world lost connectivity to their friends and family because WhatsApp was unavailable. It’s a massive medium of communication, especially in developing countries where it is a pillar for both individuals and small businesses.\n\nIn many ways, Facebook has had a positive impact on the world. But that doesn’t make them above scrutiny or criticism. Recently, the company made headlines regarding their own findings regarding how Instagram may impact the mental health of young users. It’s worthwhile for the press to dig into things like that.\n\nOn the other hand, the tech press is not above criticism either. There are many instances where outlets are not discerning as they could (and should) be. It’s more important than ever to have real debates that address nuance and complexity rather than simply pointing fingers.\n\n**Speaking of this, what are some of the issues on the Internet that strike you most?**\n\nI’m interested in how algorithms can drive human behaviour. For instance, their capacity to magnify and amplify highly engaging content – sometimes for the better and very often for the worse – is something I think about a lot. On Twitter, it’s always concerning to see someone’s name trending, often for some minor non-offense, that leads to pile-ons and harassment that in many ways feel sanctioned by the platform and become a common behaviour.\n\nIt’s also interesting how people “hack” algorithms. There is this meme called [Soylent Grin](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/soy-boy-face-soyjak) referring to a particular facial expression where people have their mouth wide open, looking shocked. You might have noticed that in many YouTube thumbnails –– it’s “thumbnail face”.\n\nThere’s a great video on the Veritasium YouTube channel on the [effectiveness of clickbait](https://youtu.be/S2xHZPH5Sng), that discusses how important thumbnails are to creators garnering clicks. The algorithm learns a behaviour that generates more clicks and boosts videos with that attribute. As a result, creators took notice and suddenly everyone was doing the Soylent Grin. I think that's an interesting example to illustrate how algorithms can drive behaviour.\n\nThis phenomenon is even more evident on TikTok. Fashion trends proliferate overnight because of viral TikTok videos. That's what I mean when I say that the frontier between internet culture and IRL culture has been shrinking.\n\n**Among the different internet cultures that you have observed so far, which one do you think was the most fascinating?**\n\nI've been thinking a lot about [parasocial relationships](https://every.to/cybernaut/the-blurred-lines-of-parasocial-relationships) after my series of articles on the subject in Cybernaut.

We have a certain image online that can be very different from that of our personal life. On the one hand, a lot of people tend to polish their online presence to gain views, likes and influence. But on the other hand, online creators cultivate this deep intimacy with their audiences.\n\nIn the first piece that I wrote about parasocial relationships, I gave an anecdote about the two creators of my favourite podcast: Hila and Ethan Klein.

Some recent favorites include “[Spent All Last Night Crying About The Wage Gap (I'm 6'3\" BTW)](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/spent-all-last-night-crying-about-the-wage-gap-im-63-btw)” and “[Violation Of My HIPAA Rights](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/violation-of-my-hipaa-rights).”*\n* **[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)** : *“The Internet Archive is a super impressive digital library that often lets you take a peek into early internet culture if you know where to look. The tag “[computermagazines](https://archive.org/details/computermagazines)” often yields some interesting gems including early editions of publications like PC Magazine and MacWorld.”*\n* **[NoSurf](https://nosurf.net/)** : *“The ubiquity of the internet inevitably means some people want to escape it. NoSurf is an interesting movement, which includes online communities across Discord and a Subreddit, where people seek support on disconnecting from the web and living fuller lives offline.

It works because it mirrors the way I think, allows me to make connections, both random and specific, and doesn’t require me to have all my ideas complete.\n\nBefore Obsidian, my writing was hit and miss due to:\n\n• the blank page\n\n• lack of inspiration\n\n• the need to finish\n\n## Obsidian gave me the tools to create a workflow\n\nWriting from scratch is hard. But that’s how I had always done it. Obsidian is also my repository for ideas and inspiration. Writing with abundance (David Perell) showed me how to use my reading to develop my own ideas. That changed everything. And with Obsidian Publish I can share my notes!\n\n## It’s like your own personal Wiki\n\nYears ago when I first started writing I needed Obsidian, or, at least, Zettelkasten.\n\nI wish I’d cultivated my journaling habit at an earlier age. All those missing years! I’m in awe of anyone who has documented their life in notebooks. Obsidian’s Daily Notes let you do just that.\n\nMy favourite element though — links, backlinks and the graph. I don’t have to think logically, just throw everything in, add links or tags and Obsidian does the rest.\n\nSince Obsidian:\n\n• Book outlining is easy\n\n• Finding references is a cinch\n\n• Nothing is forgotten\n\n• I’m writing in public\n\nObsidian lit a fire beneath me from day one.

This is a guideline and framework for Defi and yield farming. Do your own research!**\n\nMaybe you or someone you know has been bitten by the [Defi bug](https://blog.coinbase.com/a-beginners-guide-to-decentralized-finance-defi-574c68ff43c4?gi=be743f506002). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e0_E09gpROytBZpOv3elU.png?height=646&width=978)\n\nDefi, short for decentralized finance, is a blockchain-based form of finance, which does not rely on centralized financial intermediaries and is completely permissionless. Through Defi, users can lend out cryptocurrency, like a traditional bank would, and earn interest as the lender. When I first heard of this from a friend, I admit I was skeptical. Once you get over the learning curve, it’s amazing to see the bright road ahead for Defi. \n\nThis article is for people who have a solid crypto baseline and are looking to dabble in Decentralized finance by yield farming or lending out their crypto to earn interest. Below, I share my Defi framework to help you get started and earn interest on your crypto. This is a good starting point as a beginners guide that scratches the surface of the full suite of yield farming. \n\nI’ll also show you a real world example of how you can get started today (and earn 58% APY!)\n\nLet’s jump in.\n\n## Framework and Directions for Defi yield farming:\n\n* **Setup a Metamask wallet**\n  * Unlike a Centralized Exchange like Coinbase or Gemini, Metamask is a crypto wallet that allows you to store and send cryptocurrencies in a quick and easy way. I use the Chrome extension and it allows me to login into various [web3](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/) websites seamlessly and easily (no username or password needed!)\n* **Pick a chain (protocol) that you want to transact on**\n  * For example, Ethereum Mainnet is the most popular protocol and the native token used to transact on the network is ETH. You’ll need to use the native token on that network to pay for gas fees. You’ll likely hear people talk about [cross-chain swaps](https://hackernoon.com/what-are-cross-chain-swaps-2j2e37f1), but for this beginners guide, just focus on one chain. \n* **Find a reliable [DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/)/Defi project which you choose to provide liquidity to**\n  * DEX’s are autonomous programs that are built on a protocol (Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, etc) that essentially offer a high yield to attract users in to deposit liquidity on their platform. \n  * As a general rule of thumb, the lower the risk, the lower the yield projects offer (yields are calculated on an annualized basis but paid out instantly).The higher the risk, the higher the yield. You can find [rates here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/yield-farming) for top yield farming pools by value locked. Check out [this article](https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-yield-farms/) for an in-depth read on Yield Farming. \n  * When deciding on which [liquidity pool](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/what-is-a-liquidity-pool-crypto-market-liquidity) to add to (ie deposit your crypto in), do some research on the assets you’re providing liquidity for. Whether you’re supplying assets for a single-sided liquidity pool or a pair, you should feel confident that the underlying assets you’re providing to the pool will be worth more in the future, when you do decide to exit that pool (and hope for a high return!)\n* **Understand the differences between farming & staking ([Yield Farming vs. Staking](https://blog.shrimpy.io/blog/yield-farming-vs-staking-how-are-they-different))**\n  * While similar, they do differ slightly. Farming is a newer concept and intended for liquidity providers (the individuals putting up the assets) who supply liquidity (a liquid asset which is equivalent to cash, in this case, a cryptocurrency, that’s added to a pool) to a protocol in return for a yield. Staking is generally a term used for ‘locking up’ your asset to show your good faith and interest behind a project. They are very similar and both offer the same end goal (yield), but make sure you always check the fine print behind the protocol you’re depositing these assets into and see if there are any fees or fine print associated with either or.\n* **Monitor rates**\n  * Rates, calculated in [APY](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/apr-apy-bank-hopes-cant-tell-difference/) (annual percentage yield) and/or [APR](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/annual-percentage-rate-apr) (annual percentage rate), are very fluid and change rapidly depending on the price of the underlying token(s), liquidity inflows/outflows, etc. This may affect your [yield farming strategy](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-yield-farming-the-rocket-fuel-of-defi-explained/) if the rates drop, but also consider the costs of switching between farms (gas fees) and your long term goals. \n* **Have a strategy for reinvesting and taking profits**\n  * Always check to see how the [rewards are paid out.](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/concepts/advanced-topics/understanding-returns) Once you receive your rewards (often calculated in real time), you’ll need to manually harvest those tokens at your own discretion. After you harvest or redeem those rewards, it will be added to your Metamask. You have the option of re-investing those profits back into the protocol or cashing them out (ie. swapping the reward token for a stablecoin and transferring back into a Centralized Exchange or cold wallet). I would recommend a mix of both to ensure you’re cashing in on profits in the event the project dips or yield drops off. \n* **Know how to get out of liquidity pools**\n  * It’s important to know how to exit any liquidity pools you enter. Check the docs to figure out how to ‘[unstake](https://docs.traderjoexyz.com/main/the-platform/staking)’ any assets and how to remove it from the pool. I recommend doing a ‘fire drill’ exercise where you remove all of your liquidity as fast as possible to make sure you know how to get your funds out and safe in the event of a major crash or hack.\n  * It’s also important to understand how much liquidity there is in a pool (i.e. total amount of money locked up). If there’s very low liquidity (for example, $50k of total locked value), it’s going to be difficult to exit without affecting the price. If you’re in a pool with $50M of total locked value, liquidity shouldn’t be an issue or affect the price of the asset(s) you’re looking to withdraw and sell for another token.\n* **Join the community**\n  * Join Telegram and Discord Channels behind the projects you’re investing in and get a feel for the community. Ask questions about the roadmap and see what other token holders care about (and maybe even meet some internet friends!)\n* **Find some friends to share alpha with and help each other out**\n  * This might be the most important part. Find trustworthy friends and allies to share stories and trades with. More often than not, you’re going to mess up somewhere along the lines and need help (or have a friend that messes up and needs help). This has happened to me countless times and it’s good to have a friend you can call and walk through what happens! Oftentimes, you can backtrack your transactions to find where things went wrong, but it’s difficult to do on your own behind a computer screen with no help.\n* **[DYOR](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/do-your-own-research)**\n  * If it seems too good to be true, it probably is! It’s important to Do Your Own Research (DYOR) before providing any liquidity into a project. Ask yourself: why do they need my tokens and how is the yield being generated? Defi is an unregulated industry and anyone can spin up a website and offer incentives to attract people. Look for reputable Defi projects that have a known leadership team behind them and an easy to use platform with a strong community and growing TVL (total value locked). You want to avoid [rug pulls](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/11/02/squid-game-crypto-rug-pull/) at all costs (or try your best to!)\n  * Read the [docs](https://docs.traderjoexyz.com/main/welcome/master)/whitepaper behind every project you’re investing in (or at a minimum, scan them quickly). This will give you an idea of the project and their products, roadmap, etc.\n* **Beware of scammers**\n  * After joining a Telegram or Discord Group be very cautious about posting anything about your personal holdings in a public setting. Never disclose how many tokens you hold. If you’re having technical issues, post in a public place and keep the details vague. Post this: ‘Hey, I’m having issues withdrawing into USDC’ Not this: ‘Hey, I tried to withdraw $700 in USDC and can’t find it’). Confirm that anyone who DM’s you and says they are offering to help is truly an ‘admin’ or a verified person. And lastly: never *EVER* give away your Metamask Seed phrase! No support team will ever ask you for this and it’s a dead giveaway that a hacker is trying to scam you. \n* **Set a goal and stick to it!**\n  * Often overlooked, but this is the most important part of yield farming. Come in with a plan and execute on it. Don’t second guess yourself and don’t just ‘let it ride’ unless you’re OK with watching your portfolio go through peaks and troughs. Crypto markets are 10x more volatile than traditional equities markets so it’s important to set benchmarks for your returns and not let your emotions dictate your moves. \n\n## Now, let’s bring it all together and use a real example! Here’s how you can farm xJOE for a 58% APY on the Avalanche Network\n\n**Getting Started:** to start, you’re going to need to set up your Metamask Wallet. You will use this to login to various Defi/web3 websites\n\n[Getting Started with MetaMask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af_lQ1zUnoM&t=108s)\n\n***Pro tips:***\n\n* ‘Pin’ your Metamask extension to Chrome so you can easily click it. You’re going to be checking this quite a bit! \n* Save your seed phrase and make sure it’s in multiple areas (physical and digital). You cannot recover this and you’re screwed if you lose it! \n* Most Defi projects are only compatible off a desktop browser, so you cannot make any trades off your phone. Metamask has a mobile app but I prefer the Chrome Extension. If a project is crashing and you want to cash out in a hurry, you’ll need to have access to the laptop which you have your Metamask installed on (or have your seed phrase handy to be able to login off a new computer)\n\n**Adding Avalanche Network to your Metamask:** the default network for Metamask is Ethereum Mainnet. However, we’ll be staking and farming within the Avalanche ecosystem (lower gas and quicker transactions than Ethereum), so you’ll need to manually add this as a new network.\n\n[Adding Avalanche Network to Metmask](https://crypto-explained.com/services/how-to-add-avalanche-network-to-metamask/)\n\nOnce you have the Avalanche Network setup in Metamask, you’re ready to send assets into Metamask. \n\n***Note:*** *if you’re using Coinbase, you can purchase AVAX and transfer directly into your Metamask Wallet, just make sure you switch over to the Avalanche Network on your Metamask!*\n\nIf you cannot buy AVAX (native token of Avalanche Network that is needed to pay for gas fees), you will need to send an ERC-20 [compatible token](https://eidoo.io/erc20-tokens-list) to your Ethereum Mainnet Wallet (I used ETH). Go ahead and transfer your ETH or other token (from Coinbase, Gemini, cold wallet, etc.) into your Metamask account\n\n[How to Deposit ETH to MetaMask (Add Ethereum To Your Wallet)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMTYAMPQzSk)\n\n***Pro tips:*** \n\n* Make sure the asset you are sending into Metmask is listed under ‘Assets’ in Metamask so it shows up \n* Make sure you have enough ETH to cover gas fees (very high at the moment)\n\nOnce you can see the ETH in your Metamask account, you’ll need to **bridge this over to the Avalanche Network**, since it is a different protocol. The bridge essentially wraps your tokens and converts them into comptable format on the other network. A simple analogy is like transferring your cell phone plan from one network to another, but imagine if you kept your same number.\n\n[Avalanche Bridge: Transferring from Ethereum to Avalanche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLnNMfINwS0&t=85s)\n\n*Pro tips:* \n\n* At the time of writing, if you bridge over $75 onto the Avalanche Network, you will be eligible for an [airdrop](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/airdrop-cryptocurrency.asp) to help cover your gas fees. \n* Make sure you have added in the new asset within Avalanche Network. For instance, if you bridged over ETH, it will now be under ‘wETH.e’, not ‘ETH’, since you left the Ethereum Network.\n\n**Once this is bridged over, you’re ready to begin your Defi journey in the Avalanche Network!** \n\n**Buying $JOE Token:** head on over to [TraderJoe](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/home), the largest DEX (Decentralized Exchange) on the Avalanche Network. Login with your Metamask and then you can begin trading. You can trade your ‘wETH.e’ that you transferred over and now swap this into JOE (but, remember to make sure you have some AVAX to cover the gas fees!)\n\n[TraderJoe Tutorials - Platform Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXr6LI2NDGc)\n\n** \n Staking & Farming:** once you swap for JOE, you can now stake and farm this (yes, you can do both but you need to stake your JOE into xJOE first) to get double rewards. You’re essentially providing liquidity in two pools and getting double the rewards. Here is how you do it:\n\n[How to Stake Joe and xJOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hyWTwVYhJY)\n\nAnd Voila! You’re now providing liquidity and earning yield on your assets. Your rewards are displayed in real time on the platform under the ‘*Farm*’ page. You will need to harvest and claim your rewards (JOE), which will get added to your Metamask wallet. You can then cash them out into USDC.e (or other stablecoins) for profits or reinvest back into the xJOE farm. \n\n***Pro Tips:***\n\n* I tend to harvest (claim) my rewards every few days. Once I do so, I redeem my JOE, and then re-stake it into xJOE and put it back into the farm (repeating the steps listed above). I usually cash out a small portion of xJOE into USDC.e for profits at the end of the month\n* Check to see if they charge a fee for withdrawing your assets out of the staking/farming pools (they usually don’t but some charge a withdrawal fee).\n\nTo summarize, you’re making 28% from staking your JOE into xJOE, and then another 30% for farming your xJOE, which comes to a grand total of **58% APY**\n\nThere is no other technology that has allowed individuals and institutions to trade and lend assets out in a permissionless environment than Defi has. At the time this is written, there is over [$104 Billion dollars of value](https://defipulse.com/) locked in Defi and this is just the beginning of a new wave of permissionless protocols that will unlock trillions of dollars of value for lenders and borrowers across the globe. All you need is access to wifi, a wallet and crypto coins. \n\nHappy trading!\n\nShamus", "timestamp": 1635962419, "digest": "JR8PqmdqmdwPtL4T6dzVsfHpzR0nOGf4YHG5wK0w1Xs", "contributor": "0x238FAE1cF4Cd3e82CDA997aCF48004fdEa903353"}

This is the result of endless trial and error, achieving the most accelerated technological development in history, reaching an unprecedented exponential growth.\n\n![Industrial Development](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*mkzj57LXHLEXHvPZqOd7vA.jpeg)\n\n## Collective Know-How\n\nMore than 200 years have passed since the [1st industrial revolution](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revoluci%C3%B3n_Industrial), this means that by the year 2021 while we are going through the [first great pandemic](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) of the new millennium, 100 years since the last pandemic of similar magnitude as the [Spanish flu](https://enciclopediadehistoria.com/gripe-espanola/#:\\~:text=%C2%BFQu%C3%A9%20fue%20la%20gripe%20espa%C3%B1ola%3F%20La%20gripe%20espa%C3%B1ola,provoc%C3%B3%20la%20muerte%20de%20alrededor%20de%2050%20millones.), today we are in the 4th industrial revolution and perhaps heading towards the [5th industrial revolution](https://www.fingent.com/blog/how-the-5th-industrial-revolution-is-advancing-humanity-at-workplace/).\n\nThe transmission of knowledge is a process that takes time to be expressed in practice, this not only happens with individuals, but it is also the same for society, culture, and humanity as a whole. The first thinkers/scientists such as Socrates, Aristotle, Copernicus, Newton, Einstein, Hawking, or Elon Musk all have been influenced by their predecessors.\n\nIn that sense the know-how has been accumulating in humanity expressed in the development of our environment, today we have tools that allow almost anyone with internet access to take an online course and begin to immediately apply the knowledge just acquired. Not only this but also the possibility of sharing it in real-time thanks to social networks.\n\nThis represents an unprecedented possibility, being the reason why knowhow is important, understood as an indicator to determine the development referred to the implementation of the acquired knowledge of a group or collective that are transmitted from generation to generation and are the origin of the creation of products of value for society and therefore of complex productive chains and therefore greater development.\n\n![Collective Knowhow](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*vtC76ma0zXF04guCg0FTKw.jpeg)\n\n## Knowledge Communities\n\nNowadays, human beings require the contribution of applied knowledge from each individual for their development. In this sense, social networks provide the means to disseminate this knowledge in real-time to be consumed, assimilated, recycled, and shared. This opens the possibility that communities of knowledge that are organized through platforms such as twitter, reddit, or discord can produce objects of value for society and exchange them directly among themselves, as well as between communities.\n\nIn this way, each member of the community has the possibility of contributing, acquiring, and exchanging not only ideas but also the product of their work for goods and services that are in turn provided by other members of the community. Of course, this varies depending on the interest or motive under which the group has been created, taking into account that different types of communities can interact with each other, without having mutually exclusive interests.\n\n![What’s Next](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*FWwrMM25cmEyt-Lw26CXHg.jpeg)\n\n## The Better Future\n\nThe emergence of new technologies that have facilitated communication between humans and entire communities, in conjunction with the development of the digital space, contains the potential to allow groups with specific knowledge to interact with each other, exchanging value, all of this being verified within the digital environment while occurring in the physical realm.\n\nBy making use of smart contracts secured on the network ([Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/)) any type of transaction between two individuals can be verified (Blockchain), this also applies to broad groups of people such as the transactions of business premises, an artist’s community, a scientific group, a municipality, and even a country.\n\nThis can represent the use of technology to innovate the way humans establish groups, create new voting systems with greater transparency, and even have the potential to keep humanity connected for the common good, each individual contributing from their niche of knowledge.\n\nInstead of making use of social networks and technology to escape reality, it would be the use of such applied knowledge to the renewal and innovation of the ways of interaction of humanity, groups, society, the conformation of governments, thus making more complex but at the same time decentralized and transparent the exchange of value between humans.\n\n## Note: This article is not intended to serve as financial advice.

{"id": "XCZ1N7NjMhHOXdzMocbZdwM90LIky40oJfTb_8vkdBo", "title": "Tutorial: How to Provide Liquidity on Trader Joe", "body": "## What is Trader Joe?\n\n[Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/home) is a one-stop AMM decentralized trading platform on the Avalanche network. Trader Joe combines DEX services with DeFi lending to offer leveraged trading. Trader Joe’s products are community driven which allows them to give fees collected from liquidation and swaps back to the users via the JOE/xJOE staking mechanism. JOE is a governance token that also rewards its holders with a share of exchange revenues.\n\n## What is Avalanche?\n\n[Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/) is a [layer one](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) blockchain created to host all kind of distributed applications. As another blockchain with similar utility to Ethereum, Avalanche has made small changes to how the blockchain works to optimize for speed and scalability. Avalanche aims to not only be a short term compliment to Ethereum but possibly even a substitute. Avalanche has a unique architecture. It consists of three unique chains: X-Chain, C-Chain and P-Chain. With each chain having its own purpose. Something interesting about Avalanche is that each chain uses a different consensus mechanism.\n\n## What is an AMM/CFMM?\n\nConstant Function Market Makers (CFMMs) are a classification of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) which have been applied to crypto DeFi markets. CFMMs were pioneered by several projects in the crypto community to create decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for digital asset trading and based on a mathematical function establishing a pre-defined set of prices based on the assets held in a liquidity pool. Whereas a traditional order book-based exchanges (OBs/CLOBs), traders trade against a specific counter-party.\n\n## Why Deposit Liquidity in Trader Joe?\n\nSome investors/traders may want to Provide Liquidity (LP) in an AMM style DEX for various reasons. One popular reason is the ability to earn rewards in the native governance token of the platform. This reward structure can be used to offset a concept known as [impermanent loss (IL)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/impermanent-loss) which is when someone’s assets in a pool lose relative value when the price of one asset changes dramatically against the other asset. This concept is often referred to as [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-yield-farming) and can be done under the “Farm” tab on [Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/farm).\n\n## A step-by-step guide on how to lend assets on Trader Joe:\n\n* Visit https://traderjoexyz.com and connect your wallet.\n\n![Trader Joe Connect Wallet Pop Up](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/efB_GbeDHGtEh7AgCYgGX.png?height=1474&width=2618)\n\n* If your wallet is not on the Avalanche Network, a window will prompt you to switch to the network. Click on “Switch to Avalanche” and sign it with your wallet.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ANdLwi85qg1fFm_tZGl4D.png?height=608&width=966)\n\n* Verify the chain data is correct and click approve.\n\n![Avalanche C-Chain Details](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vcixdEM2zE6ZswaHGVZad.png?height=1464&width=944)\n\n![Switch Network to Avalanche C-Chain](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ouxa0pH0h8Yl0wl_D35wC.png?height=1464&width=944)\n\n* Once you’ve switched to the Avalanche Network, you will see your wallet address up in the top right corner of the page.\n* Now you will head over to the “Pool” tab where you can pick a pool to deposit to.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q4-Pb_FT1Bbnla9XOtEVY.png?height=1464&width=2094)\n\n* In this example I selected the “AVAX-USDT.e” pool as seen in the picture below.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/X2__-6iGxvbMaXwkfjhZc.png?height=1240&width=2020)\n\n* Depending on the amount of each token in the wallet, manually choose an amount of one token and the website will fill in the matching amount for the other token. Tip: You can use the “Max” button for the coin with the smaller dollar value.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZGu8xkIJwZpsOp7GXNmzE.png?height=972&width=736)\n\n* When you have decided the amount of each asset you would like to deposit as liquidity, you will click on the button underneath to deposit.\n* The transaction will take a few seconds to go through and once you get a confirmation screen, you can be assured your assets are now deposited into the pool of your choice!\n\n  ## Resources:\n\n  **Avalanche C-Chain Block Explorer:**\n\n  <https://cchain.explorer.avax.network/>\n\n  **Ethereum -→ Avalanche Bridge:**\n\n  <https://bridge.avax.network/login>", "timestamp": 1635965129, "digest": "X3BX21tJRxAOxD9VRHyPTGh79-fSCQ_Ffy15E8iUIgI", "contributor": "0x3eC44A823E07555B5f889d8d954eec736eb5865b"}

NFTs have arisen as a consequence of the technological development of mankind and involve questions about the present, the future and in that sense many of the answers are in the past, going back in history.\n\nEven for those who already have to a greater or lesser extent some understanding of the term, it is likely that they will be faced with the difficult task of trying to explain in simple words something that we will see if it becomes a complex phenomenon with the ability to impact every area of human experience.\n\n## Why Fungible?\n\n![BTC/ETH](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*6kkAedTUE1Jw0rR4ANqAng.jpeg)\n\nI will focus on summarizing what is a Non Fungible Token — NFT.\n\nFirst of all, it is necessary to take into account what “fungible” means, from a monetary point of view, it is the property that money has of, for example, being exchanged 1:1, (i.e. $1 dollar for $1 dollar). The same is true of Bitcoin since of the 21 million Bitcoins that exist in total all are equally equivalent to each other.\n\nTherefore, unlike cryptocurrencies, NFTs are Non-Fungible and this implies that each NFT represents a guarantee of unique digital property in the form of an encrypted token that is registered in the blockchain. What this means is that every tokenized asset or NFT is subject to a unique owner, associated with a personal wallet, which can be verified on the blockchain of the network [(Ethereum)](https://ethereum.org/en/) where the asset is hosted, secured by a digital contract.\n\n## Verification of Authenticity and Certificate of Ownership\n\n![Profesor Elon Rocket Factory (PERF) NFT #1373](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*y8druaUabydy2j0VrmayJw.jpeg)\n\nThis means that any existing asset in the physical world can now be tracked in a digital public record, for example: from real estate, artwork, artists merchandise, [music albums](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/arts/music/wu-tang-clan-once-upon-a-time-in-shaolin.html), donations. Everything that involves a transaction or exchange of either a good or service can be verified by the network.\n\nFrom the cultural aspect related to the arts or music, it represents the possibility of defeating the piracy of content, it also gives the possibility of verifying the authenticity of the creative work of any person as well as safeguarding their intellectual property.\n\nIn addition to the above, this also allows artists to manage their work independently without the need of third parties who are in charge of validating the artists as relevant or not, i.e. the big galleries and museums or the music companies that hold the monopoly of the content.\n\n## NFT, Community and Decentralization\n\n![Networking Communities](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*jCxJcrR2-GPuw-m9eybnAQ.jpeg)\n\nThe innovation lies in the possibility of verifying and certifying assets of human creation such as art, music, or real estate and any exchange that occurs as a result of the interaction between two people, this implies a direct change in the way in which value is exchanged for creative activities and for everything that is useful to society.\n\nOn the other hand, NFTs also have the quality of functioning as an entry key or a way to identify each individual as a member of a community, which opens endless possibilities for the way in which present and future humans can organize themselves into groups and interact with each other.\n\nPerhaps this will allow for new ways of governance where each individual can be verified and identified within each community through a digital token as an active member of that community. This can be translated into new voting systems and therefore greater decentralization since each NFT within an ecosystem could be equivalent to a vote within a [decentralized organization](https://101blockchains.com/define-dao-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/).\n\n## Mainstream NFTs\n\n![Reese Witherspoon Tweet about buying her first NFT](https://miro.medium.com/max/1216/1\\*tGTHCW12wwQ9dM5bsvV3LA.png)\n\nAlthough it is something new today in (Q4) 2021 it is a phenomenon that as a good product of technological development and the digital era, it is deploying fast and its massive adoption seems that compared to previous technologies and innovations will be so fast that people will make use of them without even realizing it.\n\nWhen artists and athletes like [Sharika](https://www.instagram.com/p/CULLYI4ML9C/), [Maluma](https://ethernitychain.medium.com/ethernity-chain-presents-icon-x-maluma-e8c94e4e9692), [Messi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSpTr6Yplqs&ab_channel=EthernityChain), [Shaquille O’Neal](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/04/shaq-to-release-nft-collection/), or [Ressee Witherspoon](https://twitter.com/ReeseW/status/1447608205224316931) with millions of followers join the fever for NFTs it may be an indication that something is happening.\n\n## The Future Now\n\n![The Future is Now](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*dPIRMG1PE6i79CpRN41CDw.jpeg)\n\nThe future is happening before our eyes, we live in a world where everything happens very fast, information flies, and many times we are saturated with information. However, nothing stands still, progress and technological development is increasingly accelerated.\n\nBecause of its innovative nature, it is an environment where all actors are learning on the fly and everything happens at an accelerated speed.\n\n## Developing Technology\n\nDeveloping technology that influences diverse communities and not just in the art or sports industry, but technology, gaming, social networking, design, music, and almost any aspect of human life.\n\nSo join me in following what is happening in this space that is just beginning and can be built together.\n\n## Note: This article is not intended to serve as financial advice.

Everything that involves a transaction or exchange of either a good or service can be verified by the network.\n\nFrom the cultural aspect related to the arts or music, it represents the possibility of defeating the piracy of content, it also gives the possibility of verifying the authenticity of the creative work of any person as well as safeguarding their intellectual property.\n\nIn addition to the above, this also allows artists to manage their work independently without the need of third parties who are in charge of validating the artists as relevant or not, i.e. the big galleries and museums or the music companies that hold the monopoly of the content.\n\n## NFT, Community and Decentralization\n\n![Networking Communities](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*jCxJcrR2-GPuw-m9eybnAQ.jpeg)\n\nThe innovation lies in the possibility of verifying and certifying assets of human creation such as art, music, or real estate and any exchange that occurs as a result of the interaction between two people, this implies a direct change in the way in which value is exchanged for creative activities and for everything that is useful to society.\n\nOn the other hand, NFTs also have the quality of functioning as an entry key or a way to identify each individual as a member of a community, which opens endless possibilities for the way in which present and future humans can organize themselves into groups and interact with each other.\n\nPerhaps this will allow for new ways of governance where each individual can be verified and identified within each community through a digital token as an active member of that community. This can be translated into new voting systems and therefore greater decentralization since each NFT within an ecosystem could be equivalent to a vote within a [decentralized organization](https://101blockchains.com/define-dao-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/).\n\n## Mainstream NFTs\n\n![Reese Witherspoon Tweet about buying her first NFT](https://miro.medium.com/max/1216/1\\*tGTHCW12wwQ9dM5bsvV3LA.png)\n\nAlthough it is something new today in (Q4) 2021 it is a phenomenon that as a good product of technological development and the digital era, it is deploying fast and its massive adoption seems that compared to previous technologies and innovations will be so fast that people will make use of them without even realizing it.\n\nWhen artists and athletes like [Sharika](https://www.instagram.com/p/CULLYI4ML9C/), [Maluma](https://ethernitychain.medium.com/ethernity-chain-presents-icon-x-maluma-e8c94e4e9692), [Messi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSpTr6Yplqs&ab_channel=EthernityChain), [Shaquille O’Neal](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/04/shaq-to-release-nft-collection/), or [Ressee Witherspoon](https://twitter.com/ReeseW/status/1447608205224316931) with millions of followers join the fever for NFTs it may be an indication that something is happening.\n\n## The Future Now\n\n![The Future is Now](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*dPIRMG1PE6i79CpRN41CDw.jpeg)\n\nThe future is happening before our eyes, we live in a world where everything happens very fast, information flies, and many times we are saturated with information. However, nothing stands still, progress and technological development is increasingly accelerated.\n\nBecause of its innovative nature, it is an environment where all actors are learning on the fly and everything happens at an accelerated speed.\n\n## Developing Technology\n\nDeveloping technology that influences diverse communities and not just in the art or sports industry, but technology, gaming, social networking, design, music, and almost any aspect of human life.\n\nSo join me in following what is happening in this space that is just beginning and can be built together.\n\n## Note: This article is not intended to serve as financial advice.

This is the result of endless trial and error, achieving the most accelerated technological development in history, reaching an unprecedented exponential growth.\n\n![Industrial Development](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*mkzj57LXHLEXHvPZqOd7vA.jpeg)\n\n## Collective Know-How\n\nMore than 200 years have passed since the [1st industrial revolution](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revoluci%C3%B3n_Industrial), this means that by the year 2021 while we are going through the [first great pandemic](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) of the new millennium, 100 years since the last pandemic of similar magnitude as the [Spanish flu](https://enciclopediadehistoria.com/gripe-espanola/#:\\~:text=%C2%BFQu%C3%A9%20fue%20la%20gripe%20espa%C3%B1ola%3F%20La%20gripe%20espa%C3%B1ola,provoc%C3%B3%20la%20muerte%20de%20alrededor%20de%2050%20millones.), today we are in the 4th industrial revolution and perhaps heading towards the [5th industrial revolution](https://www.fingent.com/blog/how-the-5th-industrial-revolution-is-advancing-humanity-at-workplace/).\n\nThe transmission of knowledge is a process that takes time to be expressed in practice, this not only happens with individuals, but it is also the same for society, culture, and humanity as a whole. The first thinkers/scientists such as Socrates, Aristotle, Copernicus, Newton, Einstein, Hawking, or Elon Musk all have been influenced by their predecessors.\n\nIn that sense the know-how has been accumulating in humanity expressed in the development of our environment, today we have tools that allow almost anyone with internet access to take an online course and begin to immediately apply the knowledge just acquired. Not only this but also the possibility of sharing it in real-time thanks to social networks.\n\nThis represents an unprecedented possibility, being the reason why knowhow is important, understood as an indicator to determine the development referred to the implementation of the acquired knowledge of a group or collective that are transmitted from generation to generation and are the origin of the creation of products of value for society and therefore of complex productive chains and therefore greater development.\n\n![Collective Knowhow](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*vtC76ma0zXF04guCg0FTKw.jpeg)\n\n## Knowledge Communities\n\nNowadays, human beings require the contribution of applied knowledge from each individual for their development. In this sense, social networks provide the means to disseminate this knowledge in real-time to be consumed, assimilated, recycled, and shared. This opens the possibility that communities of knowledge that are organized through platforms such as twitter, reddit, or discord can produce objects of value for society and exchange them directly among themselves, as well as between communities.\n\nIn this way, each member of the community has the possibility of contributing, acquiring, and exchanging not only ideas but also the product of their work for goods and services that are in turn provided by other members of the community. Of course, this varies depending on the interest or motive under which the group has been created, taking into account that different types of communities can interact with each other, without having mutually exclusive interests.\n\n![What’s Next](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*FWwrMM25cmEyt-Lw26CXHg.jpeg)\n\n## The Better Future\n\nThe emergence of new technologies that have facilitated communication between humans and entire communities, in conjunction with the development of the digital space, contains the potential to allow groups with specific knowledge to interact with each other, exchanging value, all of this being verified within the digital environment while occurring in the physical realm.\n\nBy making use of smart contracts secured on the network ([Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/)) any type of transaction between two individuals can be verified (Blockchain), this also applies to broad groups of people such as the transactions of business premises, an artist’s community, a scientific group, a municipality, and even a country.\n\nThis can represent the use of technology to innovate the way humans establish groups, create new voting systems with greater transparency, and even have the potential to keep humanity connected for the common good, each individual contributing from their niche of knowledge.\n\nInstead of making use of social networks and technology to escape reality, it would be the use of such applied knowledge to the renewal and innovation of the ways of interaction of humanity, groups, society, the conformation of governments, thus making more complex but at the same time decentralized and transparent the exchange of value between humans.\n\n## Note: This article is not intended to serve as financial advice.

Lo anterior como resultado de un sin fin de pruebas y errores, logrando el desarrollo tecnológico más acelerado de la historia, hasta alcanzar en el presente un crecimiento exponencial sin precedentes.\n\n![Desarrollo Industrial](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CCnJAhW8ISlwT4g9O1hm_.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\n## Saber Hacer Colectivo\n\nHan pasado más de 200 años desde la 1ra [revolución industrial](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revoluci%C3%B3n_Industrial), esto quiere decir que para el año 2021 mientras atravesamos la [primera gran pandemia](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) del nuevo milenio, 100 años desde la ultima pandemia de magnitudes similares como fue la [gripe española](https://enciclopediadehistoria.com/gripe-espanola/#:\\~:text=%C2%BFQu%C3%A9%20fue%20la%20gripe%20espa%C3%B1ola%3F%20La%20gripe%20espa%C3%B1ola,provoc%C3%B3%20la%20muerte%20de%20alrededor%20de%2050%20millones.), hoy nos encontramos en la 4ta revolución industrial y quizá dirigidos hacia la [5ta revolución industrial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L43Np8B9xK0&ab_channel=TEDxTalks)\n\nLa transmisión del conocimiento es un proceso que toma tiempo para verse expresado en la práctica, esto no solo ocurre con los individuos, es igual para la sociedad, la cultura y la humanidad como un todo. Desde los primeros pensadores/científicos como Sócrates, Aristóteles, pasando por Copérnico, Newton, Einstein, Hawking o Elon Musk todos se han visto influenciados por sus antecesores.\n\nEn ese sentido el saber hacer (Knowhow) se ha ido acumulando en la humanidad expresado en el desarrollo de nuestro entorno, hoy contamos con herramientas que permiten que casi cualquier persona con acceso a internet pueda tomar un curso en línea y comenzar a aplicar de forma inmediata el conocimiento que recién adquirió. No solo esto, sino que además cuenta con la posibilidad de compartirlo en tiempo real gracias a las redes sociales.\n\nEsto representa una posibilidad sin precedentes siendo la razón por la cual es importante el saber hacer ([knowhow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L43Np8B9xK0&ab_channel=TEDxTalks)), entendido como un indicador para determinar el desarrollo referido a la puesta en práctica de los conocimientos adquiridos de un grupo o el colectivo que se transmiten de generación en generación y son el origen de la creación de productos de valor para la sociedad y por lo tanto de cadenas productivas complejas y por ende mayor desarrollo.\n\n![Saber Hacer Colectivo](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*vtC76ma0zXF04guCg0FTKw.jpeg)\n\n# Comunidades de Conocimiento\n\nEn la actualidad el ser humano requiere del aporte del conocimiento aplicado de cada individuo para su desarrollo, en ese sentido, con las redes sociales se dispone de medios para difundir dicho conocimiento en tiempo real para ser consumido, asimilado, reciclado y compartido. Esto abre la posibilidad a que comunidades de conocimiento que se organizan a través de plataformas como twitter, reddit o discord puedan producir objetos de valor para la sociedad e intercambiarlos directamente entre sí, así como entre comunidades.\n\nDe está manera cada miembro de la comunidad tiene la posibilidad de aportar, adquirir e intercambiar no solo ideas, también puede ser el producto de su trabajo por bienes y/o servicios que a su vez son prestados por otros miembros de la comunidad. Por su puesto, esto varia dependiendo del interés o motivo bajo el cual el grupo se ha creado, a su vez, tomando en cuenta que diversos tipos de comunidades pueden interactuar entre sí, sin que hayan intereses excluyentes entre sí.\n\n![El Porvenir](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*FWwrMM25cmEyt-Lw26CXHg.jpeg)\n\n## El Futuro Mejor\n\nEl surgimiento de nuevas tecnologías que han facilitado la comunicación entre seres humanos y comunidades enteras, en conjunto con el desarrollo del espacio digital, contiene el potencial de permitir que agrupaciones con conocimientos específicos interactúen entre sí, intercambiando valor, todo esto siendo verificado dentro del entorno digital mientras ocurre en el ámbito físico.\n\nHaciendo uso de contratos inteligentes asegurados en la red ([Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/)) se puede verificar (Cadena de bloques) cualquier tipo de transacción entre dos individuos, esto también aplica para amplios grupos de personas como pueden ser las transacciones de un local comercial, la comunidad de un artista, un grupo científico, un municipio e incluso un país.\n\nEsto puede representar el uso de la tecnología para innovar la manera en la que los humanos establecen grupos, crear nuevos sistema de votación con mayor transparencia e incluso cuenta con el potencial de mantener a la humanidad conectada por el bien común, cada individuo aportando desde su nicho de conocimiento.\n\nEn vez de hacer uso de las redes sociales y la tecnología para escapar de la realidad, seria el uso de dicho conocimiento aplicado para la renovación e innovación de las maneras de interacción de la humanidad, los grupos, la sociedad, la conformación de gobiernos, haciendo así mas complejo pero al mismo tiempo descentralizado y transparente el intercambio de valor entre humanos.\n\n## Nota: Este articulo no tiene intención de servir como consejo financiero.

{"id": "jIepfgZ2FoDC72xUg5OhMiq8-i2YZudgtcSLDXNFu5U", "title": "What is an NFT? - DanteAc", "body": "![Digital Evolution](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*FmA1ow4X7rVeCS9lBNhe_w.jpeg)\n\nThis is a question that many people are asking at the moment and the interest is just going to increase through time. NFTs have arisen as a consequence of the technological development of mankind and involve questions about the present, the future and in that sense many of the answers are in the past, going back in history.\n\nEven for those who already have to a greater or lesser extent some understanding of the term, it is likely that they will be faced with the difficult task of trying to explain in simple words something that we will see if it becomes a complex phenomenon with the ability to impact every area of human experience.\n\n## Why Fungible?\n\n![BTC/ETH](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*6kkAedTUE1Jw0rR4ANqAng.jpeg)\n\nI will focus on summarizing what is a Non Fungible Token — NFT.\n\nFirst of all, it is necessary to take into account what “fungible” means, from a monetary point of view, it is the property that money has of, for example, being exchanged 1:1, (i.e. $1 dollar for $1 dollar). The same is true of Bitcoin since of the 21 million Bitcoins that exist in total all are equally equivalent to each other.\n\nTherefore, unlike cryptocurrencies, NFTs are Non-Fungible and this implies that each NFT represents a guarantee of unique digital property in the form of an encrypted token that is registered in the blockchain. What this means is that every tokenized asset or NFT is subject to a unique owner, associated with a personal wallet, which can be verified on the blockchain of the network [(Ethereum)](https://ethereum.org/en/) where the asset is hosted, secured by a digital contract.\n\n## Verification of Authenticity and Certificate of Ownership\n\n![Profesor Elon Rocket Factory (PERF) NFT #1373](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*y8druaUabydy2j0VrmayJw.jpeg)\n\nThis means that any existing asset in the physical world can now be tracked in a digital public record, for example: from real estate, artwork, artists merchandise, [music albums](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/arts/music/wu-tang-clan-once-upon-a-time-in-shaolin.html), donations. Everything that involves a transaction or exchange of either a good or service can be verified by the network.\n\nFrom the cultural aspect related to the arts or music, it represents the possibility of defeating the piracy of content, it also gives the possibility of verifying the authenticity of the creative work of any person as well as safeguarding their intellectual property.\n\nIn addition to the above, this also allows artists to manage their work independently without the need of third parties who are in charge of validating the artists as relevant or not, i.e. the big galleries and museums or the music companies that hold the monopoly of the content.\n\n## NFT, Community and Decentralization\n\n![Networking Communities](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*jCxJcrR2-GPuw-m9eybnAQ.jpeg)\n\nThe innovation lies in the possibility of verifying and certifying assets of human creation such as art, music, or real estate and any exchange that occurs as a result of the interaction between two people, this implies a direct change in the way in which value is exchanged for creative activities and for everything that is useful to society.\n\nOn the other hand, NFTs also have the quality of functioning as an entry key or a way to identify each individual as a member of a community, which opens endless possibilities for the way in which present and future humans can organize themselves into groups and interact with each other.\n\nPerhaps this will allow for new ways of governance where each individual can be verified and identified within each community through a digital token as an active member of that community. This can be translated into new voting systems and therefore greater decentralization since each NFT within an ecosystem could be equivalent to a vote within a [decentralized organization](https://101blockchains.com/define-dao-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/).\n\n## Mainstream NFTs\n\n![Reese Witherspoon Tweet about buying her first NFT](https://miro.medium.com/max/1216/1\\*tGTHCW12wwQ9dM5bsvV3LA.png)\n\nAlthough it is something new today in (Q4) 2021 it is a phenomenon that as a good product of technological development and the digital era, it is deploying fast and its massive adoption seems that compared to previous technologies and innovations will be so fast that people will make use of them without even realizing it.\n\nWhen artists and athletes like [Sharika](https://www.instagram.com/p/CULLYI4ML9C/), [Maluma](https://ethernitychain.medium.com/ethernity-chain-presents-icon-x-maluma-e8c94e4e9692), [Messi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSpTr6Yplqs&ab_channel=EthernityChain), [Shaquille O’Neal](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/04/shaq-to-release-nft-collection/), or [Ressee Witherspoon](https://twitter.com/ReeseW/status/1447608205224316931) with millions of followers join the fever for NFTs it may be an indication that something is happening.\n\n## The Future Now\n\n![The Future is Now](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*dPIRMG1PE6i79CpRN41CDw.jpeg)\n\nThe future is happening before our eyes, we live in a world where everything happens very fast, information flies, and many times we are saturated with information. However, nothing stands still, progress and technological development is increasingly accelerated.\n\nBecause of its innovative nature, it is an environment where all actors are learning on the fly and everything happens at an accelerated speed.\n\n## Developing Technology\n\nDeveloping technology that influences diverse communities and not just in the art or sports industry, but technology, gaming, social networking, design, music, and almost any aspect of human life.\n\nSo join me in following what is happening in this space that is just beginning and can be built together.\n\n## Note: This article is not intended to serve as financial advice.

Provide Liquidity for the WETH-FRAK pairs on Sushiswap and Uniswap v2.2. Stake the LP tokens on [GYSR.io](https://www.gysr.io/) and earn FRAK\n\n**The economics**\n\n30 Million FRAK will be distributed over a period of 90 days. Each of the 2pools will be assigned 15 Million FRAK each to be distributed equally over the 90 day period. Rewards vest over an additional 90 day period. For example your rewards from day n will vest linearly over n + 90 days. This means your rewards will fully vest after 90 days but you can withdraw rewards at any point before and receive your currently vested rewards (rewards \\* n/90).\n\n**The logic**Liquidity Mining incentives are a way to build liquid markets for the Fraktal DAO token (FRAK) across major decentralised exchanges (i.e AMMs). In addition, it is a way to further distribute the FRAK token to a broader userbase and decentralise the ecosystem to a greater extent. With that being said, we have implemented vesting to reduce the risk for vampire-like attacks where degens swoop in rapidly, accumulating extremely high ROIs and exit the project just as quickly to create a handsome profit for themselves, but leaving a trail of destruction behind with liquidity being pulled and the reward token being dumped. Vesting should counteract this situation and attract more long-term minded liquidity providers who believe in the project enough to stick around for the full 180 days (day 90 + 90) to have all of their tokens vested.\n\nTo get started head over to any of the supported AMM pools, provide WETH-FRAK liquidity, and stake those tokens on GYSR to automatically begin receiving rewards from October 4, 2021.\n\nIf you have any question reach out to us on [discord](https://discord.com/invite/P6fCPvtZtq).\n\n**Useful Info**\n\nTo acquire FRAK: <https://tinyurl.com/zfdd7nwx>\n\nFRAK Token Address (ERC20): 0xa6a5deea66550772d4a2d77ecbe0187451a4f19e\n\nGYSR Sushiswap Reward Pool (Stake your SLP here): <https://discover.gysr.io/pool/0xc448df940d5991bdc05f0442709c8df25c370640>\n\nGYSR Uniswap v2 Reward Pool (Stake your uni-v2 LP here):Univ2 GYSR reward pool is live for staking.

{"id": "nsQDaCJP0Tqe_FYaTP1OYHEvPA-Mdx5y3KbENSFRbxo", "title": "$ENS Token Allocation (Claiming Opens Nov 8)", "body": "Since we [announced that ENS would be launching a DAO](https://ens.mirror.xyz/) and $ENS token to govern key components of the ENS protocol, we’ve had a lot of inquiries as to how the DAO will be structured and what the token airdrop to community members will look like.\n\nHere’s an overview of what we have planned.\n\n## ENS Token and DAO Overview\n\nThe core components of ENS are decentralized and self-running (e.g., no one can take away another person’s .ETH name), but there are a few things that require some human discretion.\n\nDuring the first week of the claim process, community members will vote directly on a [proposed ENS Constitution](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/proposed-ens-constitution/814), a set of rules and guidelines for the community.\n\nAfter that, and in its first act as a DAO, $ENS token holders will vote on a proposal to formally request from the root key holders the ability to:\n\n* govern protocol parameters, like .ETH pricing, the price oracle, and more\n* control funds from the existing community treasury, as well as receive future revenue.\n\nProposals will require the support of at least 100k tokens to go to a vote and a simple majority voting to approve with a quorum of at least 1% of all tokens.\n\nClaims will open on November 8, 2021. Users will be encouraged to delegate their voting power to a community member that represents their views ([call for delegates](https://ens.mirror.xyz/cfvfKRpQSPtZJjPQOprWqEeqv2rytE7tQkxDg6ht7Oo)) and will have **until May 4th, 2022 to claim their tokens, after which any remaining tokens will be sent to the DAO treasury**.\n\nWe have established an organization called The ENS Foundation in the Cayman Islands to legally represent the DAO, e.g. fulfill any tax obligations. The foundation's articles of incorporation give token holders the right to appoint and dismiss directors, and to instruct the foundation to take real-world actions. More details are available [here](https://ens.gitbook.io/ens-dao-governance-docs/).\n\n## ENS Constitution\n\nAs part of the claim process, those claiming $ENS tokens will vote on a [proposed ENS Constitution](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/proposed-ens-constitution/814). The ENS Constitution is a set of rules and guidelines for the ENS community on how ENS should be governed. For an article to pass, it’ll need 67% approval of all votes cast in the first week of the token launch.\n\nThe Constitution can always be amended by the ENS DAO in the future with a threshold of 67% approval and a quorum of 5% of total tokens.\n\n## ENS Token Distribution\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/24CmedtTQqbGg8OuVlTxO.png?height=1200&width=2400&&&&size=medium)\n\nThe contract address for $ENS is token.ensdao.eth (0xC18360217D8F7Ab5e7c516566761Ea12Ce7F9D72).\n\nThere will be 100 million total $ENS tokens, and the distribution is as follows:\n\n* 25% airdrop to .ETH holders (>137k accounts)\n* 25% to ENS contributors (>100 individuals and groups, plus hundreds of Discord users)\n* 50% to the DAO community treasury\n\n### Airdrop to users\n\nThe 25% of the total supply allocated for the $ENS airdrop to users will be distributed to all addresses that are or have been the registrant of a .ETH second-level domain. The distribution is based on the total time of an address's past registration and future registration as of October 31st, 2021.\n\nThe total time of future registrations is capped at 8 years. Importantly, **the retroactive airdrop is per account, not per name**. This means that each address is counted for a given day based on whether it owns at least one .ETH name on that day.\n\nThe airdrop also features a 2x multiplier for Ethereum accounts that have set their Primary ENS Name (formerly known as Reverse Record), since this is an indicator that someone is an active user.\n\nThe airdrop formula is roughly:\n\n0\\.27 \\* (# days the account owned at least one ENS name)\n\n\\+\n\n0\\.067 \\* (# days until the expiration of the last name on the account)\n\nThe total is then multiplied by 2 if the account also has a Primary ENS Name set.\n\nWe recognize that this will be disappointing to some users who only own subdomains or DNS domains imported to ENS. Given that the initial purpose of the DAO is to govern the parameters of the .ETH registrar, and determine how to allocate the funds collected by it, however, we determined it was fair to give users that have contributed to that system the power to affect its future.\n\n### Contributors\n\nThe 25% designated for contributors will be allocated to over 100 individuals and organizations that have contributed in significant ways to ENS over the last four years, including the core team at True Names LTD, external contributors, significant integrations, translators, root key holders, and more.\n\nTokens for core contributors and launch advisors will have a four year lock-up and vesting schedule.\n\nThere are no tokens allocated for investors, since there are none.\n\nA portion of the contributors allocation has also been set aside for >450 active participants in the ENS Discord.\n\n### Community Treasury\n\nThe remaining 50% of $ENS tokens is allocated to the DAO. 10% of this allocation will be available to the DAO at launch, with the remaining unlocking over 4 years. This is in addition to the ENS treasury of funds raised from .ETH name registrations that the DAO is expected to receive from the ENS root multisig.\n\nThe DAO is encouraged to allocate these tokens towards community focused initiatives to help the development and growth of ENS, such as grants, hackathons, meetups and more.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nWe’ll be opening the token claim process on November 8.

{"id": "JVlv6QIA1DYX2fMWyzsOsWQL7cwhBnyFM-eMSkFy98g", "title": "Fraktal DAO Launches on Arbitrum", "body": "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Eh2cURyNw7P5PLz2eOaGug.png)\n\nThe Fraktal DAO on Arbitrum is the holy grail of the Fraktal ecosystem. It manages the marketplace, fees, funds and the protocol for fractionalizing NFTs. The more protocol usage, the more fees are collected and distributed to members of the DAO. We designed a model where users are paid to participate, which we believe is the future for any type of voting mechanisms or governance.\n\n## What is Arbitrum?\n\nA layer 2 solution designed to improve the capabilities of Ethereum smart contracts — boosting their speed and scalability, while still providing the high level of security of Ethereum’s layer 1.\n\nWhereas independent layer 1 blockchains, often naively hyped as ‘Ethereum killers’ do feature lower gas fees, this is because their network is less robust, less secure, and consequently cheaper than Ethereum. Ironically, many of these blockchains are intentionally built to be EVM compatible and are not scalable themselves.\n\n## Why are we focusing on Arbitrum?\n\nBecause it offers the best user experience possible, which means low cost, fast, and highly secure transactions that are ultimately settled on Ethereum mainnet. Instead of launching our marketplace directly onto an expensive Ethereum Mainnet or worse — a cheap, inferior layer 1, we are building on a truly secure and cost effective network.\n\n## How Fraktal DAOs are structured.\n\nOur primary DAO is on Mainnet and holds the Fraktal treasury and any assets of value. To avoid exorbitant gas costs on Mainnet, we deployed a clone Fraktal DAO on the xDai network. The DAO on xDai is used specifically for vote intensive proposals such as displaying NFT’s at galleries or operations focused proposals where no value is being moved as a result of the vote. The xDai network offers low-cost, on-chain transactions that are secure enough for voting, but inadequate for managing transactions where significant value is being moved, unlike Arbitrum.\n\n## What the future holds and how Arbitrum fits in.\n\n## Phase 1\n\nArbitrum replaces xDai. All xDai DAO members must ragequit and redeposit their tokens into the Arbitrum DAO. This process will not be automated. Voter turnout has been low, and we believe active participants should be rewarded with the fees collected from the Fraktal marketplace and protocol.\n\n## Phase 2\n\nArbitrum replaces Ethereum Mainnet and funds are migrated to the Arbitrum DAO. The biggest challenge in migrating Fraktal’s assets to Arbitrum is building a bridge from Mainnet supporting NFTs. Once the assets have been bridged, the Fraktal marketplace and protocol can be deployed on Arbitrum. The protocol can technically be deployed on Arbitrum now, but there is no way to send NFT’s to Arbitrum, so there would be no point.\n\n**Arbitrum Deployment**\n\nDue to concentrated activity in the first 2 iterations of Fraktal DAOs among a handful of participants, we decided to take a different approach when deploying this DAO. We have chosen the 7 most active participants (by contributions to Discord, GitHub, social media, and general business development). These 7 members are the genesis Arbitrum DAO members.\n\nThe founding DAO members are:\n\n**Cryptnotiq** 0x77DD52c08F4aAA9dA42ED1bF2e738B8969Ab980F : Designed the initial Fraktal protocol and is an active contributor and voice in pushing the project forward.\n\n**Arthunter** 0x46ec2102EB83eF52a1193489d52F22D6C1b1B97D : NFT Collector contributing to partnership strategies and artist collaborations.\n\n**Stras** 0x7DCb309e6900Fc6e1ea580f438883B8F886d3E53 : Running marketing\n\n**earth2travis** 0xbc5b552641e5d203f0a6c230aa9dc14da7450053 : Keeping everything running smoothly on the development side and largely contributing to every aspect of the project\n\n**DrHongo** 0x7932810A66FEdc6c72a2578Fc83F44521832DEC2 : Writing smart contracts\n\n**Torgmeister11** 0x77fa39f3adf09bde9d4f175e40d0854d21a33318 : Helping run Discord and contributing to writing, leading the community while also building an NFT AMM project using the Fraktal protocol\n\n**MR_LIGZ** 0x6fEF3D3226e9da958cC66bCb513db55224E1F1AE : Marketing ninja and social media strategist\n\nWithout these contributors, Fraktal would not exist. We have decided to airdrop each of these contributors 5m FRAK (worth \\~$10,000 at the time of publishing) directly into the Arbitrum DAO to be used as voting shares. Each member is free to increase their voting power by tributing more FRAK into the DAO. These members have proven to form the foundation of the Fraktal ecosystem and the backbone for bootstrapping the Arbitrum DAO. If you disagree with any of these members, you can join the DAO and issue a proposal to kick them out.\n\n**Everyone else currently in the xDai DAO must follow these steps to join.**\n\nArbitrum is its own blockchain (L2), you are required to bridge ETH or any ERC-20 token via the [Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) and add the Arbitrum network to MetaMask.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Ragequit from XDai DAO\n\n* Open a Proposal to exit the DAO. When you do so, you receive your share of the DAO Bank (i.e your FRAK)\n* Transfer FRAK from xDai to Ethereum via <https://omni.xdaichain.com/bridge>\n\nMake sure metamask network is on xDAI. xDAI FRAK address: 0x2473b9380a8cbb195544bc8577b2f8a076e96320\n\n2\\.

Today, we’re thrilled to announce Anoma’s first public testnet: Feigenbaum.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*ygP0CgVBnYjRuQNc)\n\nAnnouncing Feigenbaum: Anoma’s first public testnet\n\n## What is Feigenbaum?\n\nFeigenbaum is Anoma’s first public test network, developed and currently maintained by the team building Anoma. It is the first milestone in Anoma’s public testnet roadmap, which has been constructed to enable a progressive deployment of components and features, and to facilitate the participation of early users in testing and interacting with the implementation– thereby parallelizing the development of further features, and the gathering and integration of external user feedback.\n\n*Fractals* are a recurring theme in the design of Anoma, noticeable, for instance, in how the protocol upgrade mechanism works or in how Anoma’s ecosystem scales via the co-existence of many instances. Thus, Anoma’s protocol version names take inspiration from fractals, beginning with the Feigenbaum testnet, named after the [Feigenbaum attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map), a deterministic fractal with a very low [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension) dimension.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Upgrades](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-upgrades/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Scaling](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-scaling/)\n\n## What features does Feigenbaum support?\n\nThe current version of the protocol provides an early demonstration of the intent gossip and matchmaker components in the peer-to-peer layer, which are very particular to the design of the Anoma protocol and unprecedented in the architecture of other Layer 1 blockchains. It also offers a playground for customizing and deploying validity predicates and transactions in Rust. Anoma implements proof-of-stake (PoS) as its sibyl resistance mechanism and Tendermint, a variant of the practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism (PBFT). Finally, interactions with the protocol are facilitated via the command-line interface (CLI) client, node, and wallet.\n\n## What can you do on Feigenbaum?\n\nIn addition to the basic interactions with the ledger, Feigenbaum already enables experimentation for users who might be interested in operating and directly participating in the network at mainnet launch.\n\nThe roles\\* supported are operating validator nodes, intent gossip, and matchmaking nodes. For builders that enjoy playing with Rust, we encourage them to try [customizing validity predicates](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/ledger/customize.html), transactions, or even [the matchmaker node](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/intent-gossip-and-matchmaker.html). For early end-users that are not intimidated by the command-line, it’s not too early to start with the basics, such as [setting up a wallet](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/wallet.html) with addresses, getting some testnet tokens from the faucet account, making transfers, and staking– or, for the most adventurous ones, a primer to Anoma as a [multivariate, multivariable protocol](https://twitter.com/awasunyin/status/1422508932635967489?s=20), you can start crafting custom intents and deploying them directly to the intents gossip network.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Intent Gossip & Matchmaking system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Validity Predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/)\n\n\\*[Stay tuned](https://twitter.com/anomanetwork) for a new series of articles on our blog that explain each role in the Anoma Network!\n\n## How do I participate in the Feigenbaum testnet?\n\nAs a public, permissionless testnet, anyone can join anonymously by pulling the code from the [repository](https://github.com/anoma/anoma/releases/tag/v0.2.0) and following the instructions in the [docs](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/).\n\nA few members from the team building Anoma will also be participating in the Feigenbaum testnet to ensure that it runs smoothly. Furthermore, some will be available on Anoma’s [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/RzN98vXbFt) (#feigenbaum channel) to help out with installation or any other issues, as well as for gathering user feedback.\n\nFinally, to stay up-to-date on all news and communications related to Anoma’s Feigenbaum and future testnets, we recommend that you fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/GLzTF37vwokbFYeW9) to receive the testnet newsletter.\n", "timestamp": 1635970169, "digest": "V2i0wCCs6GlnscEyhRAvlBzpPJVQlcwBt-uxi9FlLso", "contributor": "0xa3b0B3EaA0eb40f74976F6aF0b0b2AD1F6Db1771"}
{"id": "npoL57sl-hGiZ-OyJcn9Tt200zXdJQUAq3sxb6rg1wc", "title": "Introducing Anoma: A Blockchain for Private Asset-Agnostic Bartering", "body": "## What is Anoma?\n\nAnoma is a sovereign, proof-of-stake blockchain that enables private, asset-agnostic bartering among *any number of parties*. To illustrate the capabilities of Anoma, we’ll go through three examples and provide an overview of some of the key components of the protocol.\n\n## Private transfers with one asset type\n\nIn the first example, there are two participants: Alice, residing in San Francisco, and Bob, residing in Zürich. Alice and Bob had dinner together abroad, before they returned to their respective countries. To settle the bill for dinner, Alice wants to pay Bob in BTC.\n\nIn this example, two parties wish to transact, where the sender’s asset type (BTC) coincides with the receiver’s asset type. The Anoma blockchain is able to settle this transaction in zero-knowledge privacy. On Anoma, observers will not be able to infer any information about this transaction between Alice and Bob. Additionally, this transaction will look indistinguishable from any other transaction involving BTC, ETH, or any other cryptocurrencies.\n\n## Private transfers with two asset types\n\nIn the second example, Alice is on a business trip in Shanghai and visits 1984 Bookstore & Café, a trendy coffee shop in the bustling megacity. Alice, who holds primarily BTC in her mobile wallet, wants to pay for coffee.\n\nJust like the first example, this transaction involves two parties: Alice and the coffee shop. However, the sender’s asset type (BTC) does not coincide with the recipient’s asset type, as the coffee shop only accepts CNY or CNYC, a stablecoin form of 人民币. Through Anoma, Alice can spend BTC and the coffee shop can receive CNYC.\n\nUnder the hood, the Anoma blockchain automatically facilitates exchange between BTC and CNYC at the best market rate at the time, and all intermediate transactions (sending BTC, the BTC/CNYC exchange, and receiving CNYC) benefit from privacy provided by a multi-denomination zero-knowledge transfer circuit, which enables different types of assets to share one anonymity set. This way, the privacy guarantees will not be limited by the transaction volume of each individual asset.\n\nThis transaction is enabled by Anoma’s custom-tailored state machine, which has an built-in trade system supporting cross-chain asset transfers and settlement, a novel account system based on *validity predicates*, and an *intent matching system* with liquidity incentivization.\n\n## N-party bartering\n\nIn the third example there are three parties: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice holds BTC and wants DOT, Bob holds ETH and wants BTC, and Charlie holds DOT and wants ETH.\n\nIn this case, there are three parties, and no two can directly trade with each other because their desires are pairwise mismatched. The Anoma intent matching system and blockchain are able to match and settle the wants of all three participants at the same time. In other words, Anoma enables *bartering *among all three parties, as Alice, Bob, and Charlie do not need to agree on a common means of exchange in order to satisfy their individual wants.\n\nUsing the components described above, combined with custom zero-knowledge circuits, all interactions involved in an *𝐍*-party barter can benefit from the same privacy guarantees as a simple two-party asset transfer. Moreover, users of Anoma can barter any types of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fungible-assets, non-fungible assets or any upcoming types that represent more complex valuables.\n\nLastly, the Anoma blockchain is equipped with a distributed key generation and threshold decryption scheme to prevent reordering transactions and front-running trades.\n\n## The motivations behind Anoma\n\nThe motivations behind Anoma are threefold: the loss of individual financial privacy, the loss of local financial sovereignty, and the inability of humankind to coordinate at scale.\n\nFirst, the loss of financial privacy is fueled by the non-consensual usage of sensitive data about each individual’s financial activity by third parties. In mild cases, this results in intrusive commercial practices, such as targeted advertising or monetization of sensitive information. In more severe cases, this contributes to national and foreign governmental and corporate surveillance programs.\n\nSecond, the loss of local financial sovereignty results from the dependence on traditional financial systems — from electronic forms of fiat currencies to the permissioned backbone of international wire transfers. These systems, which often consist of a complex web of direct and indirect intermediaries, are susceptible to capture by governments, who can leverage them to enforce their sanctions on domestic or foreign residents.\n\nThird, humankind lacks the tools to solve problems of a cross-border nature which require the coordination of large groups of distinct economic agents. An existentially threatening subset of them, *collective action problems*, are currently only addressable through mechanisms that rely on the intervention of governments. Unfortunately, said problems often transcend national borders, thereby rendering the enforcement capabilities of Westphalian nation states inadequate.\n\n## The vision behind Anoma\n\nThe Anoma blockchain protocol aims to facilitate “*Self-Sovereign Communities”* by providing tools that grant increased control to individuals and communities’ of the systems governing their day-to-day aspects and activities, such as financial privacy, sovereignty, and coordination.\n\nAs the first instances of the Anoma protocol focus on granting privacy-preserving financial tools, the Anoma blockchain protocol places special emphasis on supporting any kind of asset and on zero-knowledge privacy regardless of the denomination of the assets.\n\nThe purpose of *undefining money *refers to the removal of any artificial constraints around what can be used as money or *means of exchange*, providing higher flexibility and control to the users of the protocol in deciding what to use — be it assets created by others or assets they created themselves. Anoma’s focus on financial self-sovereignty is also illustrated by the ***N***-party barter system, which facilitates asset-agnostic private cash in the simplest cases, but can assist in exchange, trades, and other financial activities of entire communities.\n\nFinally, in alignment with the vision, the design of the Anoma blockchain protocol scales via *fractal scaling*. Simply put, each Anoma blockchain instance is designed to integrate seamlessly with other instances, which can be specialized geographically (e.g. when Alice pays for coffee in Shanghai, this transaction is settled by the Chinese instance of Anoma) or are tailored to satisfy the needs and purposes of any real-world or virtual community (e.g. an Anoma instance that allows Animal Crossing players to trade furniture).\n\n## The team building Anoma\n\nThe [Anoma blockchain](https://anoma.network/) protocol is being built by [Heliax](https://heliax.dev/), a team currently composed of 23 cross-disciplinary members and supported by the [Anoma Foundation](http://anoma.foundation/).\n", "timestamp": 1635970185, "digest": "WXFc5F2E7P6eybfJgLGAIJt2XS03PsxHhwdrAHClamA", "contributor": "0xa3b0B3EaA0eb40f74976F6aF0b0b2AD1F6Db1771"}

The ledger is characterized by its integration with Tendermint BFT consensus and WASM, in addition to basic capabilities such as key-value store, transactions, and a command-line interface. Over the last moon cycle, the support for [validity predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/) on WASM, gas metering, and storage improvements among other changes were added to the ledger; the [intent gossip system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is able to broadcast and support simple token barter intents; and the [matchmaker](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is integrated with a WASM matching algorithm, allowing the system to match simple token barter intents. For a more in-depth view of the architecture of Anoma, take a look at the [documentation](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/).\n\n## Learning by playing with Anoma\n\nAs the design of the Anoma protocol is distinct in several ways, some features might appear unfamiliar, especially if you’re accustomed to protocols designed to be cryptocurrencies or platforms for arbitrary computation. Besides learning about Anoma via the growing base of resources, a swifter way for the playful minds would be by trying Anoma out.\n\nIf you’re interested in setting up your own local testnet of Anoma, you can find the guidelines for installing, building, operating an Anoma node [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#installing). You can also find the Rust docs for the Anoma crates [here](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/rustdoc/anoma/). Some of the most notable interactions involve validity predicates, creating and submitting *intents*, and operating the intent gossip and matchmaker systems.\n\n## Contributing to Anoma\n\nNothing would delight the core developers of Anoma more than feedback on the design, code, or documentation from the community at any scale — from typos to reviews on the design.

Unfortunately, said problems often transcend national borders, thereby rendering the enforcement capabilities of Westphalian nation states inadequate.\n\n## The vision behind Anoma\n\nThe Anoma blockchain protocol aims to facilitate “*Self-Sovereign Communities”* by providing tools that grant increased control to individuals and communities’ of the systems governing their day-to-day aspects and activities, such as financial privacy, sovereignty, and coordination.\n\nAs the first instances of the Anoma protocol focus on granting privacy-preserving financial tools, the Anoma blockchain protocol places special emphasis on supporting any kind of asset and on zero-knowledge privacy regardless of the denomination of the assets.\n\nThe purpose of *undefining money *refers to the removal of any artificial constraints around what can be used as money or *means of exchange*, providing higher flexibility and control to the users of the protocol in deciding what to use — be it assets created by others or assets they created themselves. Anoma’s focus on financial self-sovereignty is also illustrated by the ***N***-party barter system, which facilitates asset-agnostic private cash in the simplest cases, but can assist in exchange, trades, and other financial activities of entire communities.\n\nFinally, in alignment with the vision, the design of the Anoma blockchain protocol scales via *fractal scaling*. Simply put, each Anoma blockchain instance is designed to integrate seamlessly with other instances, which can be specialized geographically (e.g. when Alice pays for coffee in Shanghai, this transaction is settled by the Chinese instance of Anoma) or are tailored to satisfy the needs and purposes of any real-world or virtual community (e.g. an Anoma instance that allows Animal Crossing players to trade furniture).\n\n## The team building Anoma\n\nThe [Anoma blockchain](https://anoma.network/) protocol is being built by [Heliax](https://heliax.dev/), a team currently composed of 23 cross-disciplinary members and supported by the [Anoma Foundation](http://anoma.foundation/).\n", "timestamp": 1635970462, "digest": "VSWkAOLVoS76vLNeKV0B-fYvVJ2HLrLTVP-bvMmwBQ4", "contributor": "0x88d93ecff2B67ba407dB4A08E410647138FdeC4C"}

{"id": "YY6KRJzc9Q4TZwB9xHmcguDvlIK_fsE4b203WiBPQ6Q", "title": "Introducing Anoma: A Blockchain for Private Asset-Agnostic Bartering", "body": "## What is Anoma?\n\nAnoma is a sovereign, proof-of-stake blockchain that enables private, asset-agnostic bartering among *any number of parties*. To illustrate the capabilities of Anoma, we’ll go through three examples and provide an overview of some of the key components of the protocol.\n\n## Private transfers with one asset type\n\nIn the first example, there are two participants: Alice, residing in San Francisco, and Bob, residing in Zürich. Alice and Bob had dinner together abroad, before they returned to their respective countries. To settle the bill for dinner, Alice wants to pay Bob in BTC.\n\nIn this example, two parties wish to transact, where the sender’s asset type (BTC) coincides with the receiver’s asset type. The Anoma blockchain is able to settle this transaction in zero-knowledge privacy. On Anoma, observers will not be able to infer any information about this transaction between Alice and Bob. Additionally, this transaction will look indistinguishable from any other transaction involving BTC, ETH, or any other cryptocurrencies.\n\n## Private transfers with two asset types\n\nIn the second example, Alice is on a business trip in Shanghai and visits 1984 Bookstore & Café, a trendy coffee shop in the bustling megacity. Alice, who holds primarily BTC in her mobile wallet, wants to pay for coffee.\n\nJust like the first example, this transaction involves two parties: Alice and the coffee shop. However, the sender’s asset type (BTC) does not coincide with the recipient’s asset type, as the coffee shop only accepts CNY or CNYC, a stablecoin form of 人民币. Through Anoma, Alice can spend BTC and the coffee shop can receive CNYC.\n\nUnder the hood, the Anoma blockchain automatically facilitates exchange between BTC and CNYC at the best market rate at the time, and all intermediate transactions (sending BTC, the BTC/CNYC exchange, and receiving CNYC) benefit from privacy provided by a multi-denomination zero-knowledge transfer circuit, which enables different types of assets to share one anonymity set. This way, the privacy guarantees will not be limited by the transaction volume of each individual asset.\n\nThis transaction is enabled by Anoma’s custom-tailored state machine, which has an built-in trade system supporting cross-chain asset transfers and settlement, a novel account system based on *validity predicates*, and an *intent matching system* with liquidity incentivization.\n\n## N-party bartering\n\nIn the third example there are three parties: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice holds BTC and wants DOT, Bob holds ETH and wants BTC, and Charlie holds DOT and wants ETH.\n\nIn this case, there are three parties, and no two can directly trade with each other because their desires are pairwise mismatched. The Anoma intent matching system and blockchain are able to match and settle the wants of all three participants at the same time. In other words, Anoma enables *bartering *among all three parties, as Alice, Bob, and Charlie do not need to agree on a common means of exchange in order to satisfy their individual wants.\n\nUsing the components described above, combined with custom zero-knowledge circuits, all interactions involved in an *𝐍*-party barter can benefit from the same privacy guarantees as a simple two-party asset transfer. Moreover, users of Anoma can barter any types of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fungible-assets, non-fungible assets or any upcoming types that represent more complex valuables.\n\nLastly, the Anoma blockchain is equipped with a distributed key generation and threshold decryption scheme to prevent reordering transactions and front-running trades.\n\n## The motivations behind Anoma\n\nThe motivations behind Anoma are threefold: the loss of individual financial privacy, the loss of local financial sovereignty, and the inability of humankind to coordinate at scale.\n\nFirst, the loss of financial privacy is fueled by the non-consensual usage of sensitive data about each individual’s financial activity by third parties. In mild cases, this results in intrusive commercial practices, such as targeted advertising or monetization of sensitive information. In more severe cases, this contributes to national and foreign governmental and corporate surveillance programs.\n\nSecond, the loss of local financial sovereignty results from the dependence on traditional financial systems — from electronic forms of fiat currencies to the permissioned backbone of international wire transfers. These systems, which often consist of a complex web of direct and indirect intermediaries, are susceptible to capture by governments, who can leverage them to enforce their sanctions on domestic or foreign residents.\n\nThird, humankind lacks the tools to solve problems of a cross-border nature which require the coordination of large groups of distinct economic agents. An existentially threatening subset of them, *collective action problems*, are currently only addressable through mechanisms that rely on the intervention of governments. Unfortunately, said problems often transcend national borders, thereby rendering the enforcement capabilities of Westphalian nation states inadequate.\n\n## The vision behind Anoma\n\nThe Anoma blockchain protocol aims to facilitate “*Self-Sovereign Communities”* by providing tools that grant increased control to individuals and communities’ of the systems governing their day-to-day aspects and activities, such as financial privacy, sovereignty, and coordination.\n\nAs the first instances of the Anoma protocol focus on granting privacy-preserving financial tools, the Anoma blockchain protocol places special emphasis on supporting any kind of asset and on zero-knowledge privacy regardless of the denomination of the assets.\n\nThe purpose of *undefining money *refers to the removal of any artificial constraints around what can be used as money or *means of exchange*, providing higher flexibility and control to the users of the protocol in deciding what to use — be it assets created by others or assets they created themselves. Anoma’s focus on financial self-sovereignty is also illustrated by the ***N***-party barter system, which facilitates asset-agnostic private cash in the simplest cases, but can assist in exchange, trades, and other financial activities of entire communities.\n\nFinally, in alignment with the vision, the design of the Anoma blockchain protocol scales via *fractal scaling*. Simply put, each Anoma blockchain instance is designed to integrate seamlessly with other instances, which can be specialized geographically (e.g. when Alice pays for coffee in Shanghai, this transaction is settled by the Chinese instance of Anoma) or are tailored to satisfy the needs and purposes of any real-world or virtual community (e.g. an Anoma instance that allows Animal Crossing players to trade furniture).\n\n## The team building Anoma\n\nThe [Anoma blockchain](https://anoma.network/) protocol is being built by [Heliax](https://heliax.dev/), a team currently composed of 23 cross-disciplinary members and supported by the [Anoma Foundation](http://anoma.foundation/).\n", "timestamp": 1635970374, "digest": "JKjK9izwpgsOsufMWMJkbBrygBbKMxCdRWKvYQZz-ho", "contributor": "0x770De711ED4629790fD8Ce95C86C812149a6CCE5"}

{"id": "IGCAvCOi9PZJYWvTAOEL5aUzlvoYfEOagpyfanzZZUY", "title": "Introducing Anoma: A Blockchain for Private Asset-Agnostic Bartering", "body": "## What is Anoma?\n\nAnoma is a sovereign, proof-of-stake blockchain that enables private, asset-agnostic bartering among *any number of parties*. To illustrate the capabilities of Anoma, we’ll go through three examples and provide an overview of some of the key components of the protocol.\n\n## Private transfers with one asset type\n\nIn the first example, there are two participants: Alice, residing in San Francisco, and Bob, residing in Zürich. Alice and Bob had dinner together abroad, before they returned to their respective countries. To settle the bill for dinner, Alice wants to pay Bob in BTC.\n\nIn this example, two parties wish to transact, where the sender’s asset type (BTC) coincides with the receiver’s asset type. The Anoma blockchain is able to settle this transaction in zero-knowledge privacy. On Anoma, observers will not be able to infer any information about this transaction between Alice and Bob. Additionally, this transaction will look indistinguishable from any other transaction involving BTC, ETH, or any other cryptocurrencies.\n\n## Private transfers with two asset types\n\nIn the second example, Alice is on a business trip in Shanghai and visits 1984 Bookstore & Café, a trendy coffee shop in the bustling megacity. Alice, who holds primarily BTC in her mobile wallet, wants to pay for coffee.\n\nJust like the first example, this transaction involves two parties: Alice and the coffee shop. However, the sender’s asset type (BTC) does not coincide with the recipient’s asset type, as the coffee shop only accepts CNY or CNYC, a stablecoin form of 人民币. Through Anoma, Alice can spend BTC and the coffee shop can receive CNYC.\n\nUnder the hood, the Anoma blockchain automatically facilitates exchange between BTC and CNYC at the best market rate at the time, and all intermediate transactions (sending BTC, the BTC/CNYC exchange, and receiving CNYC) benefit from privacy provided by a multi-denomination zero-knowledge transfer circuit, which enables different types of assets to share one anonymity set. This way, the privacy guarantees will not be limited by the transaction volume of each individual asset.\n\nThis transaction is enabled by Anoma’s custom-tailored state machine, which has an built-in trade system supporting cross-chain asset transfers and settlement, a novel account system based on *validity predicates*, and an *intent matching system* with liquidity incentivization.\n\n## N-party bartering\n\nIn the third example there are three parties: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice holds BTC and wants DOT, Bob holds ETH and wants BTC, and Charlie holds DOT and wants ETH.\n\nIn this case, there are three parties, and no two can directly trade with each other because their desires are pairwise mismatched. The Anoma intent matching system and blockchain are able to match and settle the wants of all three participants at the same time. In other words, Anoma enables *bartering *among all three parties, as Alice, Bob, and Charlie do not need to agree on a common means of exchange in order to satisfy their individual wants.\n\nUsing the components described above, combined with custom zero-knowledge circuits, all interactions involved in an *𝐍*-party barter can benefit from the same privacy guarantees as a simple two-party asset transfer. Moreover, users of Anoma can barter any types of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fungible-assets, non-fungible assets or any upcoming types that represent more complex valuables.\n\nLastly, the Anoma blockchain is equipped with a distributed key generation and threshold decryption scheme to prevent reordering transactions and front-running trades.\n\n## The motivations behind Anoma\n\nThe motivations behind Anoma are threefold: the loss of individual financial privacy, the loss of local financial sovereignty, and the inability of humankind to coordinate at scale.\n\nFirst, the loss of financial privacy is fueled by the non-consensual usage of sensitive data about each individual’s financial activity by third parties. In mild cases, this results in intrusive commercial practices, such as targeted advertising or monetization of sensitive information. In more severe cases, this contributes to national and foreign governmental and corporate surveillance programs.\n\nSecond, the loss of local financial sovereignty results from the dependence on traditional financial systems — from electronic forms of fiat currencies to the permissioned backbone of international wire transfers. These systems, which often consist of a complex web of direct and indirect intermediaries, are susceptible to capture by governments, who can leverage them to enforce their sanctions on domestic or foreign residents.\n\nThird, humankind lacks the tools to solve problems of a cross-border nature which require the coordination of large groups of distinct economic agents. An existentially threatening subset of them, *collective action problems*, are currently only addressable through mechanisms that rely on the intervention of governments. Unfortunately, said problems often transcend national borders, thereby rendering the enforcement capabilities of Westphalian nation states inadequate.\n\n## The vision behind Anoma\n\nThe Anoma blockchain protocol aims to facilitate “*Self-Sovereign Communities”* by providing tools that grant increased control to individuals and communities’ of the systems governing their day-to-day aspects and activities, such as financial privacy, sovereignty, and coordination.\n\nAs the first instances of the Anoma protocol focus on granting privacy-preserving financial tools, the Anoma blockchain protocol places special emphasis on supporting any kind of asset and on zero-knowledge privacy regardless of the denomination of the assets.\n\nThe purpose of *undefining money *refers to the removal of any artificial constraints around what can be used as money or *means of exchange*, providing higher flexibility and control to the users of the protocol in deciding what to use — be it assets created by others or assets they created themselves. Anoma’s focus on financial self-sovereignty is also illustrated by the ***N***-party barter system, which facilitates asset-agnostic private cash in the simplest cases, but can assist in exchange, trades, and other financial activities of entire communities.\n\nFinally, in alignment with the vision, the design of the Anoma blockchain protocol scales via *fractal scaling*. Simply put, each Anoma blockchain instance is designed to integrate seamlessly with other instances, which can be specialized geographically (e.g. when Alice pays for coffee in Shanghai, this transaction is settled by the Chinese instance of Anoma) or are tailored to satisfy the needs and purposes of any real-world or virtual community (e.g. an Anoma instance that allows Animal Crossing players to trade furniture).\n\n## The team building Anoma\n\nThe [Anoma blockchain](https://anoma.network/) protocol is being built by [Heliax](https://heliax.dev/), a team currently composed of 23 cross-disciplinary members and supported by the [Anoma Foundation](http://anoma.foundation/).\n", "timestamp": 1635970687, "digest": "HP3E_jwrLe6_vtPU00huy4omWqu6kPLmzN_IbZf1NEg", "contributor": "0x4C8F31595b24709bed7770d557AB702B3DD9b812"}

It is the first milestone in Anoma’s public testnet roadmap, which has been constructed to enable a progressive deployment of components and features, and to facilitate the participation of early users in testing and interacting with the implementation– thereby parallelizing the development of further features, and the gathering and integration of external user feedback.\n\n*Fractals* are a recurring theme in the design of Anoma, noticeable, for instance, in how the protocol upgrade mechanism works or in how Anoma’s ecosystem scales via the co-existence of many instances. Thus, Anoma’s protocol version names take inspiration from fractals, beginning with the Feigenbaum testnet, named after the [Feigenbaum attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map), a deterministic fractal with a very low [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension) dimension.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Upgrades](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-upgrades/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Scaling](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-scaling/)\n\n## What features does Feigenbaum support?\n\nThe current version of the protocol provides an early demonstration of the intent gossip and matchmaker components in the peer-to-peer layer, which are very particular to the design of the Anoma protocol and unprecedented in the architecture of other Layer 1 blockchains. It also offers a playground for customizing and deploying validity predicates and transactions in Rust. Anoma implements proof-of-stake (PoS) as its sibyl resistance mechanism and Tendermint, a variant of the practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism (PBFT). Finally, interactions with the protocol are facilitated via the command-line interface (CLI) client, node, and wallet.\n\n## What can you do on Feigenbaum?\n\nIn addition to the basic interactions with the ledger, Feigenbaum already enables experimentation for users who might be interested in operating and directly participating in the network at mainnet launch.\n\nThe roles\\* supported are operating validator nodes, intent gossip, and matchmaking nodes. For builders that enjoy playing with Rust, we encourage them to try [customizing validity predicates](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/ledger/customize.html), transactions, or even [the matchmaker node](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/intent-gossip-and-matchmaker.html).

Following the ethos of the project and its core developers, the current implementation of the protocol has been open-sourced — paving the way for a more accessible research and developer journey of Anoma.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PnediXxrICx7HafyHdFyyA.png)\n\n## In the Anoma codebase\n\nFrom the beginning of the year, the core developers of Anoma have been working continuously on the Anoma ledger, its intent gossip system, and the matchmaker system. The ledger is characterized by its integration with Tendermint BFT consensus and WASM, in addition to basic capabilities such as key-value store, transactions, and a command-line interface. Over the last moon cycle, the support for [validity predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/) on WASM, gas metering, and storage improvements among other changes were added to the ledger; the [intent gossip system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is able to broadcast and support simple token barter intents; and the [matchmaker](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is integrated with a WASM matching algorithm, allowing the system to match simple token barter intents. For a more in-depth view of the architecture of Anoma, take a look at the [documentation](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/).\n\n## Learning by playing with Anoma\n\nAs the design of the Anoma protocol is distinct in several ways, some features might appear unfamiliar, especially if you’re accustomed to protocols designed to be cryptocurrencies or platforms for arbitrary computation. Besides learning about Anoma via the growing base of resources, a swifter way for the playful minds would be by trying Anoma out.\n\nIf you’re interested in setting up your own local testnet of Anoma, you can find the guidelines for installing, building, operating an Anoma node [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#installing). You can also find the Rust docs for the Anoma crates [here](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/rustdoc/anoma/). Some of the most notable interactions involve validity predicates, creating and submitting *intents*, and operating the intent gossip and matchmaker systems.\n\n## Contributing to Anoma\n\nNothing would delight the core developers of Anoma more than feedback on the design, code, or documentation from the community at any scale — from typos to reviews on the design. Find the contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#how-to-contribute) and a list of open issues [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma/issues).\n\nIf you feel aligned with the vision of Anoma and would be interested in getting more involved with the project, know that the current team is growing and looking for more team members driven by the purpose of making privacy-preserving and self-sovereignty tools accessible. Take a look at this [list of open positions](https://heliax.dev/jobs), including but not limited to distributed systems research, zero-knowledge cryptography research and protocol engineering in Rust.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nAn upcoming development of the Anoma protocol is in the works and it combines the above with proof-of-stake and a dynamic validator selection mechanism. Later, support for [Ferveo](https://anoma.network/blog/ferveo-a-distributed-key-generation-scheme-for-front-running-protection) for front-running protection will be integrated, with other notable features to follow. The prototype is being refined along with the technical specifications and documentation in preparation for the very first experimental public testnet of Anoma.

Unfortunately, said problems often transcend national borders, thereby rendering the enforcement capabilities of Westphalian nation states inadequate.\n\n## The vision behind Anoma\n\nThe Anoma blockchain protocol aims to facilitate “*Self-Sovereign Communities”* by providing tools that grant increased control to individuals and communities’ of the systems governing their day-to-day aspects and activities, such as financial privacy, sovereignty, and coordination.\n\nAs the first instances of the Anoma protocol focus on granting privacy-preserving financial tools, the Anoma blockchain protocol places special emphasis on supporting any kind of asset and on zero-knowledge privacy regardless of the denomination of the assets.\n\nThe purpose of *undefining money *refers to the removal of any artificial constraints around what can be used as money or *means of exchange*, providing higher flexibility and control to the users of the protocol in deciding what to use — be it assets created by others or assets they created themselves. Anoma’s focus on financial self-sovereignty is also illustrated by the ***N***-party barter system, which facilitates asset-agnostic private cash in the simplest cases, but can assist in exchange, trades, and other financial activities of entire communities.\n\nFinally, in alignment with the vision, the design of the Anoma blockchain protocol scales via *fractal scaling*. Simply put, each Anoma blockchain instance is designed to integrate seamlessly with other instances, which can be specialized geographically (e.g. when Alice pays for coffee in Shanghai, this transaction is settled by the Chinese instance of Anoma) or are tailored to satisfy the needs and purposes of any real-world or virtual community (e.g. an Anoma instance that allows Animal Crossing players to trade furniture).\n\n## The team building Anoma\n\nThe [Anoma blockchain](https://anoma.network/) protocol is being built by [Heliax](https://heliax.dev/), a team currently composed of 23 cross-disciplinary members and supported by the [Anoma Foundation](http://anoma.foundation/).\n", "timestamp": 1635971055, "digest": "UdXSt_ufYO5s5u-KOgajJ7kY0qQ6j5mvkLlWZDfb7kI", "contributor": "0x495e827E540cA60c93bBaC919B4627554211f33F"}

Following the ethos of the project and its core developers, the current implementation of the protocol has been open-sourced — paving the way for a more accessible research and developer journey of Anoma.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PnediXxrICx7HafyHdFyyA.png)\n\n## In the Anoma codebase\n\nFrom the beginning of the year, the core developers of Anoma have been working continuously on the Anoma ledger, its intent gossip system, and the matchmaker system. The ledger is characterized by its integration with Tendermint BFT consensus and WASM, in addition to basic capabilities such as key-value store, transactions, and a command-line interface. Over the last moon cycle, the support for [validity predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/) on WASM, gas metering, and storage improvements among other changes were added to the ledger; the [intent gossip system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is able to broadcast and support simple token barter intents; and the [matchmaker](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is integrated with a WASM matching algorithm, allowing the system to match simple token barter intents. For a more in-depth view of the architecture of Anoma, take a look at the [documentation](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/).\n\n## Learning by playing with Anoma\n\nAs the design of the Anoma protocol is distinct in several ways, some features might appear unfamiliar, especially if you’re accustomed to protocols designed to be cryptocurrencies or platforms for arbitrary computation. Besides learning about Anoma via the growing base of resources, a swifter way for the playful minds would be by trying Anoma out.\n\nIf you’re interested in setting up your own local testnet of Anoma, you can find the guidelines for installing, building, operating an Anoma node [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#installing). You can also find the Rust docs for the Anoma crates [here](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/rustdoc/anoma/). Some of the most notable interactions involve validity predicates, creating and submitting *intents*, and operating the intent gossip and matchmaker systems.\n\n## Contributing to Anoma\n\nNothing would delight the core developers of Anoma more than feedback on the design, code, or documentation from the community at any scale — from typos to reviews on the design. Find the contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#how-to-contribute) and a list of open issues [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma/issues).\n\nIf you feel aligned with the vision of Anoma and would be interested in getting more involved with the project, know that the current team is growing and looking for more team members driven by the purpose of making privacy-preserving and self-sovereignty tools accessible. Take a look at this [list of open positions](https://heliax.dev/jobs), including but not limited to distributed systems research, zero-knowledge cryptography research and protocol engineering in Rust.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nAn upcoming development of the Anoma protocol is in the works and it combines the above with proof-of-stake and a dynamic validator selection mechanism. Later, support for [Ferveo](https://anoma.network/blog/ferveo-a-distributed-key-generation-scheme-for-front-running-protection) for front-running protection will be integrated, with other notable features to follow. The prototype is being refined along with the technical specifications and documentation in preparation for the very first experimental public testnet of Anoma.

To illustrate the capabilities of Anoma, we’ll go through three examples and provide an overview of some of the key components of the protocol.\n\n## Private transfers with one asset type\n\nIn the first example, there are two participants: Alice, residing in San Francisco, and Bob, residing in Zürich. Alice and Bob had dinner together abroad, before they returned to their respective countries. To settle the bill for dinner, Alice wants to pay Bob in BTC.\n\nIn this example, two parties wish to transact, where the sender’s asset type (BTC) coincides with the receiver’s asset type. The Anoma blockchain is able to settle this transaction in zero-knowledge privacy. On Anoma, observers will not be able to infer any information about this transaction between Alice and Bob. Additionally, this transaction will look indistinguishable from any other transaction involving BTC, ETH, or any other cryptocurrencies.\n\n## Private transfers with two asset types\n\nIn the second example, Alice is on a business trip in Shanghai and visits 1984 Bookstore & Café, a trendy coffee shop in the bustling megacity. Alice, who holds primarily BTC in her mobile wallet, wants to pay for coffee.\n\nJust like the first example, this transaction involves two parties: Alice and the coffee shop. However, the sender’s asset type (BTC) does not coincide with the recipient’s asset type, as the coffee shop only accepts CNY or CNYC, a stablecoin form of 人民币. Through Anoma, Alice can spend BTC and the coffee shop can receive CNYC.\n\nUnder the hood, the Anoma blockchain automatically facilitates exchange between BTC and CNYC at the best market rate at the time, and all intermediate transactions (sending BTC, the BTC/CNYC exchange, and receiving CNYC) benefit from privacy provided by a multi-denomination zero-knowledge transfer circuit, which enables different types of assets to share one anonymity set. This way, the privacy guarantees will not be limited by the transaction volume of each individual asset.\n\nThis transaction is enabled by Anoma’s custom-tailored state machine, which has an built-in trade system supporting cross-chain asset transfers and settlement, a novel account system based on *validity predicates*, and an *intent matching system* with liquidity incentivization.\n\n## N-party bartering\n\nIn the third example there are three parties: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice holds BTC and wants DOT, Bob holds ETH and wants BTC, and Charlie holds DOT and wants ETH.\n\nIn this case, there are three parties, and no two can directly trade with each other because their desires are pairwise mismatched. The Anoma intent matching system and blockchain are able to match and settle the wants of all three participants at the same time. In other words, Anoma enables *bartering *among all three parties, as Alice, Bob, and Charlie do not need to agree on a common means of exchange in order to satisfy their individual wants.\n\nUsing the components described above, combined with custom zero-knowledge circuits, all interactions involved in an *𝐍*-party barter can benefit from the same privacy guarantees as a simple two-party asset transfer. Moreover, users of Anoma can barter any types of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fungible-assets, non-fungible assets or any upcoming types that represent more complex valuables.\n\nLastly, the Anoma blockchain is equipped with a distributed key generation and threshold decryption scheme to prevent reordering transactions and front-running trades.\n\n## The motivations behind Anoma\n\nThe motivations behind Anoma are threefold: the loss of individual financial privacy, the loss of local financial sovereignty, and the inability of humankind to coordinate at scale.\n\nFirst, the loss of financial privacy is fueled by the non-consensual usage of sensitive data about each individual’s financial activity by third parties. In mild cases, this results in intrusive commercial practices, such as targeted advertising or monetization of sensitive information. In more severe cases, this contributes to national and foreign governmental and corporate surveillance programs.\n\nSecond, the loss of local financial sovereignty results from the dependence on traditional financial systems — from electronic forms of fiat currencies to the permissioned backbone of international wire transfers. These systems, which often consist of a complex web of direct and indirect intermediaries, are susceptible to capture by governments, who can leverage them to enforce their sanctions on domestic or foreign residents.\n\nThird, humankind lacks the tools to solve problems of a cross-border nature which require the coordination of large groups of distinct economic agents. An existentially threatening subset of them, *collective action problems*, are currently only addressable through mechanisms that rely on the intervention of governments. Unfortunately, said problems often transcend national borders, thereby rendering the enforcement capabilities of Westphalian nation states inadequate.\n\n## The vision behind Anoma\n\nThe Anoma blockchain protocol aims to facilitate “*Self-Sovereign Communities”* by providing tools that grant increased control to individuals and communities’ of the systems governing their day-to-day aspects and activities, such as financial privacy, sovereignty, and coordination.\n\nAs the first instances of the Anoma protocol focus on granting privacy-preserving financial tools, the Anoma blockchain protocol places special emphasis on supporting any kind of asset and on zero-knowledge privacy regardless of the denomination of the assets.\n\nThe purpose of *undefining money *refers to the removal of any artificial constraints around what can be used as money or *means of exchange*, providing higher flexibility and control to the users of the protocol in deciding what to use — be it assets created by others or assets they created themselves. Anoma’s focus on financial self-sovereignty is also illustrated by the ***N***-party barter system, which facilitates asset-agnostic private cash in the simplest cases, but can assist in exchange, trades, and other financial activities of entire communities.\n\nFinally, in alignment with the vision, the design of the Anoma blockchain protocol scales via *fractal scaling*. Simply put, each Anoma blockchain instance is designed to integrate seamlessly with other instances, which can be specialized geographically (e.g. when Alice pays for coffee in Shanghai, this transaction is settled by the Chinese instance of Anoma) or are tailored to satisfy the needs and purposes of any real-world or virtual community (e.g. an Anoma instance that allows Animal Crossing players to trade furniture).\n\n## The team building Anoma\n\nThe [Anoma blockchain](https://anoma.network/) protocol is being built by [Heliax](https://heliax.dev/), a team currently composed of 23 cross-disciplinary members and supported by the [Anoma Foundation](http://anoma.foundation/).\n", "timestamp": 1635971306, "digest": "ir5rZAhBRUWHK68BRWcvrXu4XoaEHB00BqtWqEjDVK8", "contributor": "0xee7Cee9aa9E73B0F3A244FCF6dAccf989dDA2710"}

The last two weeks have been extremely intense and exciting for the Humanode teams, and we can’t wait to share some of the most significant news with you!\n>\n> First and foremost, Humanode has announced a strategic partnership with Republic. Republic Crypto will act as a strategic and technical advisor for Humanode in several fields ranging from technology, use cases, partnerships, to marketing and fundraising. Through rigorous technical advisory, ecosystem business development, and cross-promotional marketing, the Republic Crypto team carries a full arsenal of expertise that Humanode is thrilled to engage in preparation for the milestones ahead.\n>\n> Currently, the Humanode teams are operating extremely hard on the major tasks. As part of the development update, they’ve shared what they’ve been working on over the past two weeks. As for the network development, they’ve added simple cli to run and test local testnet, switched to a different URL scheme for the web app, made FaceTec integration corrections, and used aura keys in bioauth flow. As for the Humanode consensus protocol, they’ve fixed messages in circular visualization and refactored circular visualization. Considering crypto-biometric search and matching and liveness algorithms, the bio-auth team has fixed bugs and integrated face align module for liveness detection, and added the data generation script for it, as well as added the dataloader and training code for single frame FAS.\n>\n> The eighth Fireside talk took place in Humanode telegram voice chat on July 28th, 2021. The discussion was fully devoted to biometrics for DeFi. Listen to the recording on the Humanode Podcast, and join the team on Wednesday for the next conversation!\n>\n> Humanode’s latest blog post discusses crypto biometrics. In a nutshell, crypto-biometrics is based on a combination of various technologies and exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, information security, cybersecurity, Sybil resistance, biometrics, liveness detection, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), homomorphic encryption, and blockchain. Humanode is developing the world’s first decentralized biometric identification layer that will not only be used on the Humanode platform but which can be utilized in a variety of services, platforms, and applications. Read more about Humanode’s approach in their blog.\n>\n> Furthermore, the team published an overview of liveness detection providers. For those who aren’t familiar, biometric liveness refers to the use of computer vision technology to detect the actual presence of a living user, rather than a representation such as a photograph or a mask, video or screen, a fake silicon fingerprint, or other spoof artifacts. Check out a detailed list of liveness detection providers and a quick overview of their technologies to learn more.\n>\n> That’s a wrap!

Today, we’re thrilled to announce Anoma’s first public testnet: Feigenbaum.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*ygP0CgVBnYjRuQNc)\n\nAnnouncing Feigenbaum: Anoma’s first public testnet\n\n## What is Feigenbaum?\n\nFeigenbaum is Anoma’s first public test network, developed and currently maintained by the team building Anoma. It is the first milestone in Anoma’s public testnet roadmap, which has been constructed to enable a progressive deployment of components and features, and to facilitate the participation of early users in testing and interacting with the implementation– thereby parallelizing the development of further features, and the gathering and integration of external user feedback.\n\n*Fractals* are a recurring theme in the design of Anoma, noticeable, for instance, in how the protocol upgrade mechanism works or in how Anoma’s ecosystem scales via the co-existence of many instances. Thus, Anoma’s protocol version names take inspiration from fractals, beginning with the Feigenbaum testnet, named after the [Feigenbaum attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map), a deterministic fractal with a very low [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension) dimension.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Upgrades](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-upgrades/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Scaling](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-scaling/)\n\n## What features does Feigenbaum support?\n\nThe current version of the protocol provides an early demonstration of the intent gossip and matchmaker components in the peer-to-peer layer, which are very particular to the design of the Anoma protocol and unprecedented in the architecture of other Layer 1 blockchains. It also offers a playground for customizing and deploying validity predicates and transactions in Rust. Anoma implements proof-of-stake (PoS) as its sibyl resistance mechanism and Tendermint, a variant of the practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism (PBFT). Finally, interactions with the protocol are facilitated via the command-line interface (CLI) client, node, and wallet.\n\n## What can you do on Feigenbaum?\n\nIn addition to the basic interactions with the ledger, Feigenbaum already enables experimentation for users who might be interested in operating and directly participating in the network at mainnet launch.\n\nThe roles\\* supported are operating validator nodes, intent gossip, and matchmaking nodes.

Today, we’re thrilled to announce Anoma’s first public testnet: Feigenbaum.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*ygP0CgVBnYjRuQNc)\n\nAnnouncing Feigenbaum: Anoma’s first public testnet\n\n## What is Feigenbaum?\n\nFeigenbaum is Anoma’s first public test network, developed and currently maintained by the team building Anoma. It is the first milestone in Anoma’s public testnet roadmap, which has been constructed to enable a progressive deployment of components and features, and to facilitate the participation of early users in testing and interacting with the implementation– thereby parallelizing the development of further features, and the gathering and integration of external user feedback.\n\n*Fractals* are a recurring theme in the design of Anoma, noticeable, for instance, in how the protocol upgrade mechanism works or in how Anoma’s ecosystem scales via the co-existence of many instances. Thus, Anoma’s protocol version names take inspiration from fractals, beginning with the Feigenbaum testnet, named after the [Feigenbaum attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map), a deterministic fractal with a very low [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension) dimension.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Upgrades](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-upgrades/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Scaling](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-scaling/)\n\n## What features does Feigenbaum support?\n\nThe current version of the protocol provides an early demonstration of the intent gossip and matchmaker components in the peer-to-peer layer, which are very particular to the design of the Anoma protocol and unprecedented in the architecture of other Layer 1 blockchains. It also offers a playground for customizing and deploying validity predicates and transactions in Rust. Anoma implements proof-of-stake (PoS) as its sibyl resistance mechanism and Tendermint, a variant of the practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism (PBFT). Finally, interactions with the protocol are facilitated via the command-line interface (CLI) client, node, and wallet.\n\n## What can you do on Feigenbaum?\n\nIn addition to the basic interactions with the ledger, Feigenbaum already enables experimentation for users who might be interested in operating and directly participating in the network at mainnet launch.\n\nThe roles\\* supported are operating validator nodes, intent gossip, and matchmaking nodes. For builders that enjoy playing with Rust, we encourage them to try [customizing validity predicates](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/ledger/customize.html), transactions, or even [the matchmaker node](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/intent-gossip-and-matchmaker.html).

{"id": "Ip3Fx-q5tNrHbg5LO1uwDZ7cLGcWmxHuSZZ_mDDmcS8", "title": "Introducing Anoma: A Blockchain for Private Asset-Agnostic Bartering", "body": "## What is Anoma?\n\nAnoma is a sovereign, proof-of-stake blockchain that enables private, asset-agnostic bartering among *any number of parties*. To illustrate the capabilities of Anoma, we’ll go through three examples and provide an overview of some of the key components of the protocol.\n\n## Private transfers with one asset type\n\nIn the first example, there are two participants: Alice, residing in San Francisco, and Bob, residing in Zürich. Alice and Bob had dinner together abroad, before they returned to their respective countries. To settle the bill for dinner, Alice wants to pay Bob in BTC.\n\nIn this example, two parties wish to transact, where the sender’s asset type (BTC) coincides with the receiver’s asset type. The Anoma blockchain is able to settle this transaction in zero-knowledge privacy. On Anoma, observers will not be able to infer any information about this transaction between Alice and Bob. Additionally, this transaction will look indistinguishable from any other transaction involving BTC, ETH, or any other cryptocurrencies.\n\n## Private transfers with two asset types\n\nIn the second example, Alice is on a business trip in Shanghai and visits 1984 Bookstore & Café, a trendy coffee shop in the bustling megacity. Alice, who holds primarily BTC in her mobile wallet, wants to pay for coffee.\n\nJust like the first example, this transaction involves two parties: Alice and the coffee shop. However, the sender’s asset type (BTC) does not coincide with the recipient’s asset type, as the coffee shop only accepts CNY or CNYC, a stablecoin form of 人民币. Through Anoma, Alice can spend BTC and the coffee shop can receive CNYC.\n\nUnder the hood, the Anoma blockchain automatically facilitates exchange between BTC and CNYC at the best market rate at the time, and all intermediate transactions (sending BTC, the BTC/CNYC exchange, and receiving CNYC) benefit from privacy provided by a multi-denomination zero-knowledge transfer circuit, which enables different types of assets to share one anonymity set. This way, the privacy guarantees will not be limited by the transaction volume of each individual asset.\n\nThis transaction is enabled by Anoma’s custom-tailored state machine, which has an built-in trade system supporting cross-chain asset transfers and settlement, a novel account system based on *validity predicates*, and an *intent matching system* with liquidity incentivization.\n\n## N-party bartering\n\nIn the third example there are three parties: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice holds BTC and wants DOT, Bob holds ETH and wants BTC, and Charlie holds DOT and wants ETH.\n\nIn this case, there are three parties, and no two can directly trade with each other because their desires are pairwise mismatched. The Anoma intent matching system and blockchain are able to match and settle the wants of all three participants at the same time. In other words, Anoma enables *bartering *among all three parties, as Alice, Bob, and Charlie do not need to agree on a common means of exchange in order to satisfy their individual wants.\n\nUsing the components described above, combined with custom zero-knowledge circuits, all interactions involved in an *𝐍*-party barter can benefit from the same privacy guarantees as a simple two-party asset transfer. Moreover, users of Anoma can barter any types of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fungible-assets, non-fungible assets or any upcoming types that represent more complex valuables.\n\nLastly, the Anoma blockchain is equipped with a distributed key generation and threshold decryption scheme to prevent reordering transactions and front-running trades.\n\n## The motivations behind Anoma\n\nThe motivations behind Anoma are threefold: the loss of individual financial privacy, the loss of local financial sovereignty, and the inability of humankind to coordinate at scale.\n\nFirst, the loss of financial privacy is fueled by the non-consensual usage of sensitive data about each individual’s financial activity by third parties. In mild cases, this results in intrusive commercial practices, such as targeted advertising or monetization of sensitive information. In more severe cases, this contributes to national and foreign governmental and corporate surveillance programs.\n\nSecond, the loss of local financial sovereignty results from the dependence on traditional financial systems — from electronic forms of fiat currencies to the permissioned backbone of international wire transfers. These systems, which often consist of a complex web of direct and indirect intermediaries, are susceptible to capture by governments, who can leverage them to enforce their sanctions on domestic or foreign residents.\n\nThird, humankind lacks the tools to solve problems of a cross-border nature which require the coordination of large groups of distinct economic agents. An existentially threatening subset of them, *collective action problems*, are currently only addressable through mechanisms that rely on the intervention of governments. Unfortunately, said problems often transcend national borders, thereby rendering the enforcement capabilities of Westphalian nation states inadequate.\n\n## The vision behind Anoma\n\nThe Anoma blockchain protocol aims to facilitate “*Self-Sovereign Communities”* by providing tools that grant increased control to individuals and communities’ of the systems governing their day-to-day aspects and activities, such as financial privacy, sovereignty, and coordination.\n\nAs the first instances of the Anoma protocol focus on granting privacy-preserving financial tools, the Anoma blockchain protocol places special emphasis on supporting any kind of asset and on zero-knowledge privacy regardless of the denomination of the assets.\n\nThe purpose of *undefining money *refers to the removal of any artificial constraints around what can be used as money or *means of exchange*, providing higher flexibility and control to the users of the protocol in deciding what to use — be it assets created by others or assets they created themselves. Anoma’s focus on financial self-sovereignty is also illustrated by the ***N***-party barter system, which facilitates asset-agnostic private cash in the simplest cases, but can assist in exchange, trades, and other financial activities of entire communities.\n\nFinally, in alignment with the vision, the design of the Anoma blockchain protocol scales via *fractal scaling*. Simply put, each Anoma blockchain instance is designed to integrate seamlessly with other instances, which can be specialized geographically (e.g. when Alice pays for coffee in Shanghai, this transaction is settled by the Chinese instance of Anoma) or are tailored to satisfy the needs and purposes of any real-world or virtual community (e.g. an Anoma instance that allows Animal Crossing players to trade furniture).\n\n## The team building Anoma\n\nThe [Anoma blockchain](https://anoma.network/) protocol is being built by [Heliax](https://heliax.dev/), a team currently composed of 23 cross-disciplinary members and supported by the [Anoma Foundation](http://anoma.foundation/).\n", "timestamp": 1635971538, "digest": "esDLTV3GdBRUd_RY_LeBMlXxgBx7W3Pejnxrq4H7-PE", "contributor": "0x7D667F0C1aB2f2Bdb4A1849d639366D14bBE799D"}

Following the ethos of the project and its core developers, the current implementation of the protocol has been open-sourced — paving the way for a more accessible research and developer journey of Anoma.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PnediXxrICx7HafyHdFyyA.png)\n\n## In the Anoma codebase\n\nFrom the beginning of the year, the core developers of Anoma have been working continuously on the Anoma ledger, its intent gossip system, and the matchmaker system. The ledger is characterized by its integration with Tendermint BFT consensus and WASM, in addition to basic capabilities such as key-value store, transactions, and a command-line interface. Over the last moon cycle, the support for [validity predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/) on WASM, gas metering, and storage improvements among other changes were added to the ledger; the [intent gossip system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is able to broadcast and support simple token barter intents; and the [matchmaker](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is integrated with a WASM matching algorithm, allowing the system to match simple token barter intents. For a more in-depth view of the architecture of Anoma, take a look at the [documentation](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/).\n\n## Learning by playing with Anoma\n\nAs the design of the Anoma protocol is distinct in several ways, some features might appear unfamiliar, especially if you’re accustomed to protocols designed to be cryptocurrencies or platforms for arbitrary computation. Besides learning about Anoma via the growing base of resources, a swifter way for the playful minds would be by trying Anoma out.\n\nIf you’re interested in setting up your own local testnet of Anoma, you can find the guidelines for installing, building, operating an Anoma node [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#installing). You can also find the Rust docs for the Anoma crates [here](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/rustdoc/anoma/). Some of the most notable interactions involve validity predicates, creating and submitting *intents*, and operating the intent gossip and matchmaker systems.\n\n## Contributing to Anoma\n\nNothing would delight the core developers of Anoma more than feedback on the design, code, or documentation from the community at any scale — from typos to reviews on the design. Find the contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#how-to-contribute) and a list of open issues [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma/issues).\n\nIf you feel aligned with the vision of Anoma and would be interested in getting more involved with the project, know that the current team is growing and looking for more team members driven by the purpose of making privacy-preserving and self-sovereignty tools accessible. Take a look at this [list of open positions](https://heliax.dev/jobs), including but not limited to distributed systems research, zero-knowledge cryptography research and protocol engineering in Rust.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nAn upcoming development of the Anoma protocol is in the works and it combines the above with proof-of-stake and a dynamic validator selection mechanism. Later, support for [Ferveo](https://anoma.network/blog/ferveo-a-distributed-key-generation-scheme-for-front-running-protection) for front-running protection will be integrated, with other notable features to follow. The prototype is being refined along with the technical specifications and documentation in preparation for the very first experimental public testnet of Anoma.

Let’s explore our mission, and how we think about the mutual benefits of a long-term partnership with Sushi.\n\n**What are we building?**\n\nTempus is building secondary markets on yield. On Tempus, users can not only transform their variable rate yield farming rewards to fixed rate, but also provide liquidity to boost their existing variable yield.\n\nFor example, if you are already lending DAI on Compound, or staking ETH on Lido, you can deposit cDAI or stETH into Tempus to fix your yield farming rewards for the next few months. You can also deposit cDAI or stETH as a liquidity provider, and earn additional LP income on those assets.\n\n**Tempus partners with Sushi**\n\nThe strategic partnership between Tempus and Sushi will be mutually beneficial — it will allow Tempus to access Sushi’s community resources, pursue more integrations and engage with its users.\n\n1.  Sushi is known for its fantastic community. Tempus has built a community of over 7,000 early adopters across multiple social media channels who have participated in our [Sers Ambassador Program](https://thesers.com/). Partnering with Sushi helps us learn from the best to make sure the Tempus community will be just as awesome as Sushi’s.\n2.  Sushi’s brand new lending and margin trading platform, Kashi, offers a great integration opportunity for Tempus. We are eager to build a roadmap alongside Sushi to fill the institutional demand for fixed rates on their own platform. Tempus will be the first team to develop a fixed-rate lending solution backed by lending yields on Kashi.\n3.  Sushi has world-class engineering and business development teams, who will offer supportive guidance to Tempus as we scale from a small, 11-person team to a much larger decentralized network with multi-chain support.\n\nTempus is excited about this journey together as we push to mainnet over the next few weeks.\n\n**About Sushi**\n\nSushi’s first product, an AMM, was launched back in 2020 and it gathered a strong community from the very beginning. They expanded and successfully managed a DAO for more than a year now, bringing major innovations to the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nSushi expands horizontally in many DeFi areas and creates various products. Some of them are already live, such as BentoBox, a central place that facilitates access to liquidity for other protocols in a gas-efficient manner, or Kashi where everyone can create an isolated lending/borrowing market. Sushi is also paving the way for multi-chain DeFi — they have deployed on more than 14 chains.\n\nAll this couldn’t be possible without a great community backing the project and actively contributing to it. If you want to learn more about Sushi, we recommend this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cbtvc8Eso_g), which explains how the different parts of the protocol work and create synergies together.\n\n**About Tempus**\n\nTempus is a protocol where users can transform their variable rate yield farming rewards to fixed rate, and speculate on those yield farming rewards.\n\nHow does Tempus achieve this?\n\nUsers can deposit their yield bearing tokens (such as stETH) which Tempus splits into tokenized principal and yield tokens. Those primitives can then be traded against each other. This is made possible by the custom AMM designed by Tempus, for which we received grant funding from Balancer.\n\nTempus will offer capital-efficient fixed rate yields and high variable yields on various assets. For example, Tempus will be the first team to release fixed rate ETH 2.0 staking through Lido. Tempus will also integrate with Compound, Aave, Yearn, and Rari.\n\nTempus is live on Goerli testnet and will be launching on mainnet next month.

Through Anoma, Alice can spend BTC and the coffee shop can receive CNYC.\n\nUnder the hood, the Anoma blockchain automatically facilitates exchange between BTC and CNYC at the best market rate at the time, and all intermediate transactions (sending BTC, the BTC/CNYC exchange, and receiving CNYC) benefit from privacy provided by a multi-denomination zero-knowledge transfer circuit, which enables different types of assets to share one anonymity set. This way, the privacy guarantees will not be limited by the transaction volume of each individual asset.\n\nThis transaction is enabled by Anoma’s custom-tailored state machine, which has an built-in trade system supporting cross-chain asset transfers and settlement, a novel account system based on *validity predicates*, and an *intent matching system* with liquidity incentivization.\n\n## N-party bartering\n\nIn the third example there are three parties: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice holds BTC and wants DOT, Bob holds ETH and wants BTC, and Charlie holds DOT and wants ETH.\n\nIn this case, there are three parties, and no two can directly trade with each other because their desires are pairwise mismatched. The Anoma intent matching system and blockchain are able to match and settle the wants of all three participants at the same time. In other words, Anoma enables *bartering *among all three parties, as Alice, Bob, and Charlie do not need to agree on a common means of exchange in order to satisfy their individual wants.\n\nUsing the components described above, combined with custom zero-knowledge circuits, all interactions involved in an *𝐍*-party barter can benefit from the same privacy guarantees as a simple two-party asset transfer. Moreover, users of Anoma can barter any types of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fungible-assets, non-fungible assets or any upcoming types that represent more complex valuables.\n\nLastly, the Anoma blockchain is equipped with a distributed key generation and threshold decryption scheme to prevent reordering transactions and front-running trades.\n\n## The motivations behind Anoma\n\nThe motivations behind Anoma are threefold: the loss of individual financial privacy, the loss of local financial sovereignty, and the inability of humankind to coordinate at scale.\n\nFirst, the loss of financial privacy is fueled by the non-consensual usage of sensitive data about each individual’s financial activity by third parties. In mild cases, this results in intrusive commercial practices, such as targeted advertising or monetization of sensitive information. In more severe cases, this contributes to national and foreign governmental and corporate surveillance programs.\n\nSecond, the loss of local financial sovereignty results from the dependence on traditional financial systems — from electronic forms of fiat currencies to the permissioned backbone of international wire transfers. These systems, which often consist of a complex web of direct and indirect intermediaries, are susceptible to capture by governments, who can leverage them to enforce their sanctions on domestic or foreign residents.\n\nThird, humankind lacks the tools to solve problems of a cross-border nature which require the coordination of large groups of distinct economic agents. An existentially threatening subset of them, *collective action problems*, are currently only addressable through mechanisms that rely on the intervention of governments. Unfortunately, said problems often transcend national borders, thereby rendering the enforcement capabilities of Westphalian nation states inadequate.\n\n## The vision behind Anoma\n\nThe Anoma blockchain protocol aims to facilitate “*Self-Sovereign Communities”* by providing tools that grant increased control to individuals and communities’ of the systems governing their day-to-day aspects and activities, such as financial privacy, sovereignty, and coordination.\n\nAs the first instances of the Anoma protocol focus on granting privacy-preserving financial tools, the Anoma blockchain protocol places special emphasis on supporting any kind of asset and on zero-knowledge privacy regardless of the denomination of the assets.\n\nThe purpose of *undefining money *refers to the removal of any artificial constraints around what can be used as money or *means of exchange*, providing higher flexibility and control to the users of the protocol in deciding what to use — be it assets created by others or assets they created themselves. Anoma’s focus on financial self-sovereignty is also illustrated by the ***N***-party barter system, which facilitates asset-agnostic private cash in the simplest cases, but can assist in exchange, trades, and other financial activities of entire communities.\n\nFinally, in alignment with the vision, the design of the Anoma blockchain protocol scales via *fractal scaling*. Simply put, each Anoma blockchain instance is designed to integrate seamlessly with other instances, which can be specialized geographically (e.g. when Alice pays for coffee in Shanghai, this transaction is settled by the Chinese instance of Anoma) or are tailored to satisfy the needs and purposes of any real-world or virtual community (e.g. an Anoma instance that allows Animal Crossing players to trade furniture).\n\n## The team building Anoma\n\nThe [Anoma blockchain](https://anoma.network/) protocol is being built by [Heliax](https://heliax.dev/), a team currently composed of 23 cross-disciplinary members and supported by the [Anoma Foundation](http://anoma.foundation/).\n", "timestamp": 1635971738, "digest": "Ab5VfmGswUsQUexVW8s3XqHv6a926VhKldP4Mtcts4U", "contributor": "0x8D35F1Be3e2f223c099Dc26B14BF5e0D25B690BA"}

Following the ethos of the project and its core developers, the current implementation of the protocol has been open-sourced — paving the way for a more accessible research and developer journey of Anoma.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PnediXxrICx7HafyHdFyyA.png)\n\n## In the Anoma codebase\n\nFrom the beginning of the year, the core developers of Anoma have been working continuously on the Anoma ledger, its intent gossip system, and the matchmaker system. The ledger is characterized by its integration with Tendermint BFT consensus and WASM, in addition to basic capabilities such as key-value store, transactions, and a command-line interface. Over the last moon cycle, the support for [validity predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/) on WASM, gas metering, and storage improvements among other changes were added to the ledger; the [intent gossip system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is able to broadcast and support simple token barter intents; and the [matchmaker](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is integrated with a WASM matching algorithm, allowing the system to match simple token barter intents. For a more in-depth view of the architecture of Anoma, take a look at the [documentation](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/).\n\n## Learning by playing with Anoma\n\nAs the design of the Anoma protocol is distinct in several ways, some features might appear unfamiliar, especially if you’re accustomed to protocols designed to be cryptocurrencies or platforms for arbitrary computation. Besides learning about Anoma via the growing base of resources, a swifter way for the playful minds would be by trying Anoma out.\n\nIf you’re interested in setting up your own local testnet of Anoma, you can find the guidelines for installing, building, operating an Anoma node [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#installing). You can also find the Rust docs for the Anoma crates [here](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/rustdoc/anoma/). Some of the most notable interactions involve validity predicates, creating and submitting *intents*, and operating the intent gossip and matchmaker systems.\n\n## Contributing to Anoma\n\nNothing would delight the core developers of Anoma more than feedback on the design, code, or documentation from the community at any scale — from typos to reviews on the design. Find the contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#how-to-contribute) and a list of open issues [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma/issues).\n\nIf you feel aligned with the vision of Anoma and would be interested in getting more involved with the project, know that the current team is growing and looking for more team members driven by the purpose of making privacy-preserving and self-sovereignty tools accessible. Take a look at this [list of open positions](https://heliax.dev/jobs), including but not limited to distributed systems research, zero-knowledge cryptography research and protocol engineering in Rust.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nAn upcoming development of the Anoma protocol is in the works and it combines the above with proof-of-stake and a dynamic validator selection mechanism. Later, support for [Ferveo](https://anoma.network/blog/ferveo-a-distributed-key-generation-scheme-for-front-running-protection) for front-running protection will be integrated, with other notable features to follow. The prototype is being refined along with the technical specifications and documentation in preparation for the very first experimental public testnet of Anoma.

Let’s explore our mission, and how we think about the mutual benefits of a long-term partnership with Sushi.\n\n**What are we building?**\n\nTempus is building secondary markets on yield. On Tempus, users can not only transform their variable rate yield farming rewards to fixed rate, but also provide liquidity to boost their existing variable yield.\n\nFor example, if you are already lending DAI on Compound, or staking ETH on Lido, you can deposit cDAI or stETH into Tempus to fix your yield farming rewards for the next few months. You can also deposit cDAI or stETH as a liquidity provider, and earn additional LP income on those assets.\n\n**Tempus partners with Sushi**\n\nThe strategic partnership between Tempus and Sushi will be mutually beneficial — it will allow Tempus to access Sushi’s community resources, pursue more integrations and engage with its users.\n\n1.  Sushi is known for its fantastic community. Tempus has built a community of over 7,000 early adopters across multiple social media channels who have participated in our [Sers Ambassador Program](https://thesers.com/). Partnering with Sushi helps us learn from the best to make sure the Tempus community will be just as awesome as Sushi’s.\n2.  Sushi’s brand new lending and margin trading platform, Kashi, offers a great integration opportunity for Tempus. We are eager to build a roadmap alongside Sushi to fill the institutional demand for fixed rates on their own platform. Tempus will be the first team to develop a fixed-rate lending solution backed by lending yields on Kashi.\n3.  Sushi has world-class engineering and business development teams, who will offer supportive guidance to Tempus as we scale from a small, 11-person team to a much larger decentralized network with multi-chain support.\n\nTempus is excited about this journey together as we push to mainnet over the next few weeks.\n\n**About Sushi**\n\nSushi’s first product, an AMM, was launched back in 2020 and it gathered a strong community from the very beginning. They expanded and successfully managed a DAO for more than a year now, bringing major innovations to the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nSushi expands horizontally in many DeFi areas and creates various products. Some of them are already live, such as BentoBox, a central place that facilitates access to liquidity for other protocols in a gas-efficient manner, or Kashi where everyone can create an isolated lending/borrowing market. Sushi is also paving the way for multi-chain DeFi — they have deployed on more than 14 chains.\n\nAll this couldn’t be possible without a great community backing the project and actively contributing to it. If you want to learn more about Sushi, we recommend this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cbtvc8Eso_g), which explains how the different parts of the protocol work and create synergies together.\n\n**About Tempus**\n\nTempus is a protocol where users can transform their variable rate yield farming rewards to fixed rate, and speculate on those yield farming rewards.\n\nHow does Tempus achieve this?\n\nUsers can deposit their yield bearing tokens (such as stETH) which Tempus splits into tokenized principal and yield tokens. Those primitives can then be traded against each other. This is made possible by the custom AMM designed by Tempus, for which we received grant funding from Balancer.\n\nTempus will offer capital-efficient fixed rate yields and high variable yields on various assets. For example, Tempus will be the first team to release fixed rate ETH 2.0 staking through Lido. Tempus will also integrate with Compound, Aave, Yearn, and Rari.\n\nTempus is live on Goerli testnet and will be launching on mainnet next month. Join us on our journey to become the leading fixed-rate protocol in DeFi!\n\n[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6gauHECShr) | [Github](https://github.com/tempus-finance) | [Medium](https://medium.com/@tempusfinance) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tempusfinance) | [Website](https://tempus.finance/)\n", "timestamp": 1635971648, "digest": "_8iF8Ohqt39RrenvvlNpjH3MCtaB06YR4KYHxT-N4gI", "contributor": "0x8D35F1Be3e2f223c099Dc26B14BF5e0D25B690BA"}

Today, we’re thrilled to announce Anoma’s first public testnet: Feigenbaum.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*ygP0CgVBnYjRuQNc)\n\nAnnouncing Feigenbaum: Anoma’s first public testnet\n\n## What is Feigenbaum?\n\nFeigenbaum is Anoma’s first public test network, developed and currently maintained by the team building Anoma. It is the first milestone in Anoma’s public testnet roadmap, which has been constructed to enable a progressive deployment of components and features, and to facilitate the participation of early users in testing and interacting with the implementation– thereby parallelizing the development of further features, and the gathering and integration of external user feedback.\n\n*Fractals* are a recurring theme in the design of Anoma, noticeable, for instance, in how the protocol upgrade mechanism works or in how Anoma’s ecosystem scales via the co-existence of many instances. Thus, Anoma’s protocol version names take inspiration from fractals, beginning with the Feigenbaum testnet, named after the [Feigenbaum attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map), a deterministic fractal with a very low [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension) dimension.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Upgrades](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-upgrades/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Scaling](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-scaling/)\n\n## What features does Feigenbaum support?\n\nThe current version of the protocol provides an early demonstration of the intent gossip and matchmaker components in the peer-to-peer layer, which are very particular to the design of the Anoma protocol and unprecedented in the architecture of other Layer 1 blockchains. It also offers a playground for customizing and deploying validity predicates and transactions in Rust. Anoma implements proof-of-stake (PoS) as its sibyl resistance mechanism and Tendermint, a variant of the practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism (PBFT). Finally, interactions with the protocol are facilitated via the command-line interface (CLI) client, node, and wallet.\n\n## What can you do on Feigenbaum?\n\nIn addition to the basic interactions with the ledger, Feigenbaum already enables experimentation for users who might be interested in operating and directly participating in the network at mainnet launch.\n\nThe roles\\* supported are operating validator nodes, intent gossip, and matchmaking nodes. For builders that enjoy playing with Rust, we encourage them to try [customizing validity predicates](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/ledger/customize.html), transactions, or even [the matchmaker node](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/intent-gossip-and-matchmaker.html). For early end-users that are not intimidated by the command-line, it’s not too early to start with the basics, such as [setting up a wallet](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/wallet.html) with addresses, getting some testnet tokens from the faucet account, making transfers, and staking– or, for the most adventurous ones, a primer to Anoma as a [multivariate, multivariable protocol](https://twitter.com/awasunyin/status/1422508932635967489?s=20), you can start crafting custom intents and deploying them directly to the intents gossip network.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Intent Gossip & Matchmaking system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Validity Predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/)\n\n\\*[Stay tuned](https://twitter.com/anomanetwork) for a new series of articles on our blog that explain each role in the Anoma Network!\n\n## How do I participate in the Feigenbaum testnet?\n\nAs a public, permissionless testnet, anyone can join anonymously by pulling the code from the [repository](https://github.com/anoma/anoma/releases/tag/v0.2.0) and following the instructions in the [docs](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/).\n\nA few members from the team building Anoma will also be participating in the Feigenbaum testnet to ensure that it runs smoothly. Furthermore, some will be available on Anoma’s [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/RzN98vXbFt) (#feigenbaum channel) to help out with installation or any other issues, as well as for gathering user feedback.\n\nFinally, to stay up-to-date on all news and communications related to Anoma’s Feigenbaum and future testnets, we recommend that you fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/GLzTF37vwokbFYeW9) to receive the testnet newsletter.\n", "timestamp": 1635971751, "digest": "k7PqQb09eERXGwXzYU7C8E96EY2PeOPFb22gZl5mKBs", "contributor": "0x8D35F1Be3e2f223c099Dc26B14BF5e0D25B690BA"}

It is the first milestone in Anoma’s public testnet roadmap, which has been constructed to enable a progressive deployment of components and features, and to facilitate the participation of early users in testing and interacting with the implementation– thereby parallelizing the development of further features, and the gathering and integration of external user feedback.\n\n*Fractals* are a recurring theme in the design of Anoma, noticeable, for instance, in how the protocol upgrade mechanism works or in how Anoma’s ecosystem scales via the co-existence of many instances. Thus, Anoma’s protocol version names take inspiration from fractals, beginning with the Feigenbaum testnet, named after the [Feigenbaum attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map), a deterministic fractal with a very low [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension) dimension.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Upgrades](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-upgrades/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Scaling](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-scaling/)\n\n## What features does Feigenbaum support?\n\nThe current version of the protocol provides an early demonstration of the intent gossip and matchmaker components in the peer-to-peer layer, which are very particular to the design of the Anoma protocol and unprecedented in the architecture of other Layer 1 blockchains. It also offers a playground for customizing and deploying validity predicates and transactions in Rust. Anoma implements proof-of-stake (PoS) as its sibyl resistance mechanism and Tendermint, a variant of the practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism (PBFT). Finally, interactions with the protocol are facilitated via the command-line interface (CLI) client, node, and wallet.\n\n## What can you do on Feigenbaum?\n\nIn addition to the basic interactions with the ledger, Feigenbaum already enables experimentation for users who might be interested in operating and directly participating in the network at mainnet launch.\n\nThe roles\\* supported are operating validator nodes, intent gossip, and matchmaking nodes. For builders that enjoy playing with Rust, we encourage them to try [customizing validity predicates](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/ledger/customize.html), transactions, or even [the matchmaker node](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/intent-gossip-and-matchmaker.html). For early end-users that are not intimidated by the command-line, it’s not too early to start with the basics, such as [setting up a wallet](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/wallet.html) with addresses, getting some testnet tokens from the faucet account, making transfers, and staking– or, for the most adventurous ones, a primer to Anoma as a [multivariate, multivariable protocol](https://twitter.com/awasunyin/status/1422508932635967489?s=20), you can start crafting custom intents and deploying them directly to the intents gossip network.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Intent Gossip & Matchmaking system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Validity Predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/)\n\n\\*[Stay tuned](https://twitter.com/anomanetwork) for a new series of articles on our blog that explain each role in the Anoma Network!\n\n## How do I participate in the Feigenbaum testnet?\n\nAs a public, permissionless testnet, anyone can join anonymously by pulling the code from the [repository](https://github.com/anoma/anoma/releases/tag/v0.2.0) and following the instructions in the [docs](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/).\n\nA few members from the team building Anoma will also be participating in the Feigenbaum testnet to ensure that it runs smoothly. Furthermore, some will be available on Anoma’s [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/RzN98vXbFt) (#feigenbaum channel) to help out with installation or any other issues, as well as for gathering user feedback.\n\nFinally, to stay up-to-date on all news and communications related to Anoma’s Feigenbaum and future testnets, we recommend that you fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/GLzTF37vwokbFYeW9) to receive the testnet newsletter.\n", "timestamp": 1635971777, "digest": "r2B8aH0NbuJnMdMqCmKfsNDhhf66BY_CJ3kwIO_c_vM", "contributor": "0x6Acf04cD3c60aF7893F44E88F3ef3b413A985594"}
{"id": "Sy-y8KtYcWd0zU28yYiiomiowKuaOLTTWPnXZSTVXF4", "title": "Introducing Anoma: A Blockchain for Private Asset-Agnostic Bartering", "body": "## What is Anoma?\n\nAnoma is a sovereign, proof-of-stake blockchain that enables private, asset-agnostic bartering among *any number of parties*. To illustrate the capabilities of Anoma, we’ll go through three examples and provide an overview of some of the key components of the protocol.\n\n## Private transfers with one asset type\n\nIn the first example, there are two participants: Alice, residing in San Francisco, and Bob, residing in Zürich. Alice and Bob had dinner together abroad, before they returned to their respective countries. To settle the bill for dinner, Alice wants to pay Bob in BTC.\n\nIn this example, two parties wish to transact, where the sender’s asset type (BTC) coincides with the receiver’s asset type. The Anoma blockchain is able to settle this transaction in zero-knowledge privacy. On Anoma, observers will not be able to infer any information about this transaction between Alice and Bob. Additionally, this transaction will look indistinguishable from any other transaction involving BTC, ETH, or any other cryptocurrencies.\n\n## Private transfers with two asset types\n\nIn the second example, Alice is on a business trip in Shanghai and visits 1984 Bookstore & Café, a trendy coffee shop in the bustling megacity. Alice, who holds primarily BTC in her mobile wallet, wants to pay for coffee.\n\nJust like the first example, this transaction involves two parties: Alice and the coffee shop. However, the sender’s asset type (BTC) does not coincide with the recipient’s asset type, as the coffee shop only accepts CNY or CNYC, a stablecoin form of 人民币. Through Anoma, Alice can spend BTC and the coffee shop can receive CNYC.\n\nUnder the hood, the Anoma blockchain automatically facilitates exchange between BTC and CNYC at the best market rate at the time, and all intermediate transactions (sending BTC, the BTC/CNYC exchange, and receiving CNYC) benefit from privacy provided by a multi-denomination zero-knowledge transfer circuit, which enables different types of assets to share one anonymity set. This way, the privacy guarantees will not be limited by the transaction volume of each individual asset.\n\nThis transaction is enabled by Anoma’s custom-tailored state machine, which has an built-in trade system supporting cross-chain asset transfers and settlement, a novel account system based on *validity predicates*, and an *intent matching system* with liquidity incentivization.\n\n## N-party bartering\n\nIn the third example there are three parties: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice holds BTC and wants DOT, Bob holds ETH and wants BTC, and Charlie holds DOT and wants ETH.\n\nIn this case, there are three parties, and no two can directly trade with each other because their desires are pairwise mismatched. The Anoma intent matching system and blockchain are able to match and settle the wants of all three participants at the same time. In other words, Anoma enables *bartering *among all three parties, as Alice, Bob, and Charlie do not need to agree on a common means of exchange in order to satisfy their individual wants.\n\nUsing the components described above, combined with custom zero-knowledge circuits, all interactions involved in an *𝐍*-party barter can benefit from the same privacy guarantees as a simple two-party asset transfer. Moreover, users of Anoma can barter any types of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fungible-assets, non-fungible assets or any upcoming types that represent more complex valuables.\n\nLastly, the Anoma blockchain is equipped with a distributed key generation and threshold decryption scheme to prevent reordering transactions and front-running trades.\n\n## The motivations behind Anoma\n\nThe motivations behind Anoma are threefold: the loss of individual financial privacy, the loss of local financial sovereignty, and the inability of humankind to coordinate at scale.\n\nFirst, the loss of financial privacy is fueled by the non-consensual usage of sensitive data about each individual’s financial activity by third parties. In mild cases, this results in intrusive commercial practices, such as targeted advertising or monetization of sensitive information. In more severe cases, this contributes to national and foreign governmental and corporate surveillance programs.\n\nSecond, the loss of local financial sovereignty results from the dependence on traditional financial systems — from electronic forms of fiat currencies to the permissioned backbone of international wire transfers. These systems, which often consist of a complex web of direct and indirect intermediaries, are susceptible to capture by governments, who can leverage them to enforce their sanctions on domestic or foreign residents.\n\nThird, humankind lacks the tools to solve problems of a cross-border nature which require the coordination of large groups of distinct economic agents. An existentially threatening subset of them, *collective action problems*, are currently only addressable through mechanisms that rely on the intervention of governments. Unfortunately, said problems often transcend national borders, thereby rendering the enforcement capabilities of Westphalian nation states inadequate.\n\n## The vision behind Anoma\n\nThe Anoma blockchain protocol aims to facilitate “*Self-Sovereign Communities”* by providing tools that grant increased control to individuals and communities’ of the systems governing their day-to-day aspects and activities, such as financial privacy, sovereignty, and coordination.\n\nAs the first instances of the Anoma protocol focus on granting privacy-preserving financial tools, the Anoma blockchain protocol places special emphasis on supporting any kind of asset and on zero-knowledge privacy regardless of the denomination of the assets.\n\nThe purpose of *undefining money *refers to the removal of any artificial constraints around what can be used as money or *means of exchange*, providing higher flexibility and control to the users of the protocol in deciding what to use — be it assets created by others or assets they created themselves. Anoma’s focus on financial self-sovereignty is also illustrated by the ***N***-party barter system, which facilitates asset-agnostic private cash in the simplest cases, but can assist in exchange, trades, and other financial activities of entire communities.\n\nFinally, in alignment with the vision, the design of the Anoma blockchain protocol scales via *fractal scaling*. Simply put, each Anoma blockchain instance is designed to integrate seamlessly with other instances, which can be specialized geographically (e.g. when Alice pays for coffee in Shanghai, this transaction is settled by the Chinese instance of Anoma) or are tailored to satisfy the needs and purposes of any real-world or virtual community (e.g. an Anoma instance that allows Animal Crossing players to trade furniture).\n\n## The team building Anoma\n\nThe [Anoma blockchain](https://anoma.network/) protocol is being built by [Heliax](https://heliax.dev/), a team currently composed of 23 cross-disciplinary members and supported by the [Anoma Foundation](http://anoma.foundation/).\n", "timestamp": 1635971787, "digest": "hfnAbyOCFtcEEBKwTs012gooulWDv4JWM3dreka7tbY", "contributor": "0x6Acf04cD3c60aF7893F44E88F3ef3b413A985594"}

Following the ethos of the project and its core developers, the current implementation of the protocol has been open-sourced — paving the way for a more accessible research and developer journey of Anoma.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PnediXxrICx7HafyHdFyyA.png)\n\n## In the Anoma codebase\n\nFrom the beginning of the year, the core developers of Anoma have been working continuously on the Anoma ledger, its intent gossip system, and the matchmaker system. The ledger is characterized by its integration with Tendermint BFT consensus and WASM, in addition to basic capabilities such as key-value store, transactions, and a command-line interface. Over the last moon cycle, the support for [validity predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/) on WASM, gas metering, and storage improvements among other changes were added to the ledger; the [intent gossip system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is able to broadcast and support simple token barter intents; and the [matchmaker](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is integrated with a WASM matching algorithm, allowing the system to match simple token barter intents. For a more in-depth view of the architecture of Anoma, take a look at the [documentation](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/).\n\n## Learning by playing with Anoma\n\nAs the design of the Anoma protocol is distinct in several ways, some features might appear unfamiliar, especially if you’re accustomed to protocols designed to be cryptocurrencies or platforms for arbitrary computation. Besides learning about Anoma via the growing base of resources, a swifter way for the playful minds would be by trying Anoma out.\n\nIf you’re interested in setting up your own local testnet of Anoma, you can find the guidelines for installing, building, operating an Anoma node [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#installing). You can also find the Rust docs for the Anoma crates [here](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/rustdoc/anoma/). Some of the most notable interactions involve validity predicates, creating and submitting *intents*, and operating the intent gossip and matchmaker systems.\n\n## Contributing to Anoma\n\nNothing would delight the core developers of Anoma more than feedback on the design, code, or documentation from the community at any scale — from typos to reviews on the design. Find the contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#how-to-contribute) and a list of open issues [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma/issues).\n\nIf you feel aligned with the vision of Anoma and would be interested in getting more involved with the project, know that the current team is growing and looking for more team members driven by the purpose of making privacy-preserving and self-sovereignty tools accessible. Take a look at this [list of open positions](https://heliax.dev/jobs), including but not limited to distributed systems research, zero-knowledge cryptography research and protocol engineering in Rust.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nAn upcoming development of the Anoma protocol is in the works and it combines the above with proof-of-stake and a dynamic validator selection mechanism. Later, support for [Ferveo](https://anoma.network/blog/ferveo-a-distributed-key-generation-scheme-for-front-running-protection) for front-running protection will be integrated, with other notable features to follow. The prototype is being refined along with the technical specifications and documentation in preparation for the very first experimental public testnet of Anoma. To stay tuned with the progress and updates, find us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anomanetwork), join the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RzN98vXbFt), or [receive updates](https://anoma.network/).\n", "timestamp": 1635971797, "digest": "IezVpPcNIywIj1QY2kuWtrDHqv1mH-YXoDWwkeIlW_o", "contributor": "0x6Acf04cD3c60aF7893F44E88F3ef3b413A985594"}

Security is one of the most formidable challenges for smart contract implementation in present times. There exist concerns of inefficiencies, security breaches and some broken codes that could lead to high or unnecessary costs for any user of a protocol.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges with smart contract implementation is the fact that they have an irreversible nature and users can lose a part or whole of their funds deposited in a contract that has not been written effectively.\n\nSmart contract auditing is therefore important for the better optimization of codes and improves the performance of the smart contract, in a way that also benefits the user of that contract (for example — gas efficiency conditions), enhanced vaults or wallets on the protocols, security against hacks and more.\n\n## **Tempus Passes Security Audit of Coinspect**\n\nWe are happy to announce the completion of our first audit by [Coinspect](https://www.coinspect.com/) who were able to find only 3 medium risk bugs that have now all been fixed.\n\nAs explained by Coinspect, no high-risk vulnerabilities that would result in user funds being stolen were identified from the source code. One of the medium-risk issues detected could have a high impact but there was a low likelihood of that event taking place. This bug has now also been fixed. Other bugs are related to the power of the pool owners and whether they could update the fees without constraints and that could have an adverse impact on users in case the accounts were compromised.\n\nFind Coinspect’s audit report [here](https://www.coinspect.com/doc/Coinspect%20-%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20-%20Tempus%20v211013.pdf).\n\n## **Tempus Security Audit Competition at Code 423n4**\n\nTempus is a future yield tokenization and fixed-rate protocol that allows users to optimize their existing exposure to variable yield based on their risk tolerance. As we continue to build on other protocols it is important for us to make sure our contracts are secured in case there is a failure on the protocols that we are building on.\n\nEnterprise audits do not necessarily guarantee the quality and robustness of smart contracts. Instead of organising a bug bounty program ourselves, we decided to partner with [Code 423n4](https://code423n4.com/) that creates incentivised weekly smart contract audit competitions that allow some of the most talented security researchers to do a thorough security audit of the smart contracts. It uses a novel competitive mechanism that allows anyone to help secure protocols and platforms without having to be a full-time professional auditor. This approach is designed to increase the depth and breadth of an audit while incentivizing security researchers to find the highest-risk and rarest bugs.\n\nIn addition to that, it does not follow the approach of ‘first person to turn in the bug gets the bounty’. Instead, they reward everyone’s contributions even if there are multiple submissions of the same bug.\n\nThe smart contract audit competition for Tempus began** on** **October 14, 2021, at 00:00 UTC**.\n\nThis contest ends **on October 20, 2021, at 23:59 UTC**.\n\n**We have allocated $50,000 USDC for anyone who is able to find bugs or can help us improve gas optimization on Tempus.**\n\n**Read more about the contest **[**here**](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus)** and start now!**\n\n## **About Tempus**\n\nTempus is a protocol where users can re-allocate the risk of interest rate fluctuations between each other.

Today, we’re thrilled to announce Anoma’s first public testnet: Feigenbaum.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*ygP0CgVBnYjRuQNc)\n\nAnnouncing Feigenbaum: Anoma’s first public testnet\n\n## What is Feigenbaum?\n\nFeigenbaum is Anoma’s first public test network, developed and currently maintained by the team building Anoma. It is the first milestone in Anoma’s public testnet roadmap, which has been constructed to enable a progressive deployment of components and features, and to facilitate the participation of early users in testing and interacting with the implementation– thereby parallelizing the development of further features, and the gathering and integration of external user feedback.\n\n*Fractals* are a recurring theme in the design of Anoma, noticeable, for instance, in how the protocol upgrade mechanism works or in how Anoma’s ecosystem scales via the co-existence of many instances. Thus, Anoma’s protocol version names take inspiration from fractals, beginning with the Feigenbaum testnet, named after the [Feigenbaum attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map), a deterministic fractal with a very low [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension) dimension.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Upgrades](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-upgrades/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Scaling](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-scaling/)\n\n## What features does Feigenbaum support?\n\nThe current version of the protocol provides an early demonstration of the intent gossip and matchmaker components in the peer-to-peer layer, which are very particular to the design of the Anoma protocol and unprecedented in the architecture of other Layer 1 blockchains. It also offers a playground for customizing and deploying validity predicates and transactions in Rust. Anoma implements proof-of-stake (PoS) as its sibyl resistance mechanism and Tendermint, a variant of the practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism (PBFT). Finally, interactions with the protocol are facilitated via the command-line interface (CLI) client, node, and wallet.\n\n## What can you do on Feigenbaum?\n\nIn addition to the basic interactions with the ledger, Feigenbaum already enables experimentation for users who might be interested in operating and directly participating in the network at mainnet launch.\n\nThe roles\\* supported are operating validator nodes, intent gossip, and matchmaking nodes. For builders that enjoy playing with Rust, we encourage them to try [customizing validity predicates](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/ledger/customize.html), transactions, or even [the matchmaker node](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/intent-gossip-and-matchmaker.html). For early end-users that are not intimidated by the command-line, it’s not too early to start with the basics, such as [setting up a wallet](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/wallet.html) with addresses, getting some testnet tokens from the faucet account, making transfers, and staking– or, for the most adventurous ones, a primer to Anoma as a [multivariate, multivariable protocol](https://twitter.com/awasunyin/status/1422508932635967489?s=20), you can start crafting custom intents and deploying them directly to the intents gossip network.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Intent Gossip & Matchmaking system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Validity Predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/)\n\n\\*[Stay tuned](https://twitter.com/anomanetwork) for a new series of articles on our blog that explain each role in the Anoma Network!\n\n## How do I participate in the Feigenbaum testnet?\n\nAs a public, permissionless testnet, anyone can join anonymously by pulling the code from the [repository](https://github.com/anoma/anoma/releases/tag/v0.2.0) and following the instructions in the [docs](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/).\n\nA few members from the team building Anoma will also be participating in the Feigenbaum testnet to ensure that it runs smoothly.

{"id": "7je1Zvpy8QTSnGHIhhxe3p6tw2o1fGsygm0ybpAx4og", "title": "Introducing Anoma: A Blockchain for Private Asset-Agnostic Bartering", "body": "## What is Anoma?\n\nAnoma is a sovereign, proof-of-stake blockchain that enables private, asset-agnostic bartering among *any number of parties*. To illustrate the capabilities of Anoma, we’ll go through three examples and provide an overview of some of the key components of the protocol.\n\n## Private transfers with one asset type\n\nIn the first example, there are two participants: Alice, residing in San Francisco, and Bob, residing in Zürich. Alice and Bob had dinner together abroad, before they returned to their respective countries. To settle the bill for dinner, Alice wants to pay Bob in BTC.\n\nIn this example, two parties wish to transact, where the sender’s asset type (BTC) coincides with the receiver’s asset type. The Anoma blockchain is able to settle this transaction in zero-knowledge privacy. On Anoma, observers will not be able to infer any information about this transaction between Alice and Bob. Additionally, this transaction will look indistinguishable from any other transaction involving BTC, ETH, or any other cryptocurrencies.\n\n## Private transfers with two asset types\n\nIn the second example, Alice is on a business trip in Shanghai and visits 1984 Bookstore & Café, a trendy coffee shop in the bustling megacity. Alice, who holds primarily BTC in her mobile wallet, wants to pay for coffee.\n\nJust like the first example, this transaction involves two parties: Alice and the coffee shop. However, the sender’s asset type (BTC) does not coincide with the recipient’s asset type, as the coffee shop only accepts CNY or CNYC, a stablecoin form of 人民币. Through Anoma, Alice can spend BTC and the coffee shop can receive CNYC.\n\nUnder the hood, the Anoma blockchain automatically facilitates exchange between BTC and CNYC at the best market rate at the time, and all intermediate transactions (sending BTC, the BTC/CNYC exchange, and receiving CNYC) benefit from privacy provided by a multi-denomination zero-knowledge transfer circuit, which enables different types of assets to share one anonymity set. This way, the privacy guarantees will not be limited by the transaction volume of each individual asset.\n\nThis transaction is enabled by Anoma’s custom-tailored state machine, which has an built-in trade system supporting cross-chain asset transfers and settlement, a novel account system based on *validity predicates*, and an *intent matching system* with liquidity incentivization.\n\n## N-party bartering\n\nIn the third example there are three parties: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice holds BTC and wants DOT, Bob holds ETH and wants BTC, and Charlie holds DOT and wants ETH.\n\nIn this case, there are three parties, and no two can directly trade with each other because their desires are pairwise mismatched. The Anoma intent matching system and blockchain are able to match and settle the wants of all three participants at the same time. In other words, Anoma enables *bartering *among all three parties, as Alice, Bob, and Charlie do not need to agree on a common means of exchange in order to satisfy their individual wants.\n\nUsing the components described above, combined with custom zero-knowledge circuits, all interactions involved in an *𝐍*-party barter can benefit from the same privacy guarantees as a simple two-party asset transfer. Moreover, users of Anoma can barter any types of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fungible-assets, non-fungible assets or any upcoming types that represent more complex valuables.\n\nLastly, the Anoma blockchain is equipped with a distributed key generation and threshold decryption scheme to prevent reordering transactions and front-running trades.\n\n## The motivations behind Anoma\n\nThe motivations behind Anoma are threefold: the loss of individual financial privacy, the loss of local financial sovereignty, and the inability of humankind to coordinate at scale.\n\nFirst, the loss of financial privacy is fueled by the non-consensual usage of sensitive data about each individual’s financial activity by third parties. In mild cases, this results in intrusive commercial practices, such as targeted advertising or monetization of sensitive information. In more severe cases, this contributes to national and foreign governmental and corporate surveillance programs.\n\nSecond, the loss of local financial sovereignty results from the dependence on traditional financial systems — from electronic forms of fiat currencies to the permissioned backbone of international wire transfers. These systems, which often consist of a complex web of direct and indirect intermediaries, are susceptible to capture by governments, who can leverage them to enforce their sanctions on domestic or foreign residents.\n\nThird, humankind lacks the tools to solve problems of a cross-border nature which require the coordination of large groups of distinct economic agents. An existentially threatening subset of them, *collective action problems*, are currently only addressable through mechanisms that rely on the intervention of governments. Unfortunately, said problems often transcend national borders, thereby rendering the enforcement capabilities of Westphalian nation states inadequate.\n\n## The vision behind Anoma\n\nThe Anoma blockchain protocol aims to facilitate “*Self-Sovereign Communities”* by providing tools that grant increased control to individuals and communities’ of the systems governing their day-to-day aspects and activities, such as financial privacy, sovereignty, and coordination.\n\nAs the first instances of the Anoma protocol focus on granting privacy-preserving financial tools, the Anoma blockchain protocol places special emphasis on supporting any kind of asset and on zero-knowledge privacy regardless of the denomination of the assets.\n\nThe purpose of *undefining money *refers to the removal of any artificial constraints around what can be used as money or *means of exchange*, providing higher flexibility and control to the users of the protocol in deciding what to use — be it assets created by others or assets they created themselves. Anoma’s focus on financial self-sovereignty is also illustrated by the ***N***-party barter system, which facilitates asset-agnostic private cash in the simplest cases, but can assist in exchange, trades, and other financial activities of entire communities.\n\nFinally, in alignment with the vision, the design of the Anoma blockchain protocol scales via *fractal scaling*. Simply put, each Anoma blockchain instance is designed to integrate seamlessly with other instances, which can be specialized geographically (e.g. when Alice pays for coffee in Shanghai, this transaction is settled by the Chinese instance of Anoma) or are tailored to satisfy the needs and purposes of any real-world or virtual community (e.g. an Anoma instance that allows Animal Crossing players to trade furniture).\n\n## The team building Anoma\n\nThe [Anoma blockchain](https://anoma.network/) protocol is being built by [Heliax](https://heliax.dev/), a team currently composed of 23 cross-disciplinary members and supported by the [Anoma Foundation](http://anoma.foundation/).\n", "timestamp": 1635972005, "digest": "sZv8-8a2UAz58yu7xnlOg4v-RPXrbJ0bo5m4p5k-fkY", "contributor": "0x67832D525b5f5f40Ac70bd68f930E9AB09593771"}

Following the ethos of the project and its core developers, the current implementation of the protocol has been open-sourced — paving the way for a more accessible research and developer journey of Anoma.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PnediXxrICx7HafyHdFyyA.png)\n\n## In the Anoma codebase\n\nFrom the beginning of the year, the core developers of Anoma have been working continuously on the Anoma ledger, its intent gossip system, and the matchmaker system. The ledger is characterized by its integration with Tendermint BFT consensus and WASM, in addition to basic capabilities such as key-value store, transactions, and a command-line interface. Over the last moon cycle, the support for [validity predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/) on WASM, gas metering, and storage improvements among other changes were added to the ledger; the [intent gossip system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is able to broadcast and support simple token barter intents; and the [matchmaker](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is integrated with a WASM matching algorithm, allowing the system to match simple token barter intents. For a more in-depth view of the architecture of Anoma, take a look at the [documentation](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/).\n\n## Learning by playing with Anoma\n\nAs the design of the Anoma protocol is distinct in several ways, some features might appear unfamiliar, especially if you’re accustomed to protocols designed to be cryptocurrencies or platforms for arbitrary computation. Besides learning about Anoma via the growing base of resources, a swifter way for the playful minds would be by trying Anoma out.\n\nIf you’re interested in setting up your own local testnet of Anoma, you can find the guidelines for installing, building, operating an Anoma node [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#installing). You can also find the Rust docs for the Anoma crates [here](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/rustdoc/anoma/). Some of the most notable interactions involve validity predicates, creating and submitting *intents*, and operating the intent gossip and matchmaker systems.\n\n## Contributing to Anoma\n\nNothing would delight the core developers of Anoma more than feedback on the design, code, or documentation from the community at any scale — from typos to reviews on the design. Find the contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#how-to-contribute) and a list of open issues [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma/issues).\n\nIf you feel aligned with the vision of Anoma and would be interested in getting more involved with the project, know that the current team is growing and looking for more team members driven by the purpose of making privacy-preserving and self-sovereignty tools accessible. Take a look at this [list of open positions](https://heliax.dev/jobs), including but not limited to distributed systems research, zero-knowledge cryptography research and protocol engineering in Rust.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nAn upcoming development of the Anoma protocol is in the works and it combines the above with proof-of-stake and a dynamic validator selection mechanism. Later, support for [Ferveo](https://anoma.network/blog/ferveo-a-distributed-key-generation-scheme-for-front-running-protection) for front-running protection will be integrated, with other notable features to follow. The prototype is being refined along with the technical specifications and documentation in preparation for the very first experimental public testnet of Anoma.

Security is one of the most formidable challenges for smart contract implementation in present times. There exist concerns of inefficiencies, security breaches and some broken codes that could lead to high or unnecessary costs for any user of a protocol.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges with smart contract implementation is the fact that they have an irreversible nature and users can lose a part or whole of their funds deposited in a contract that has not been written effectively.\n\nSmart contract auditing is therefore important for the better optimization of codes and improves the performance of the smart contract, in a way that also benefits the user of that contract (for example — gas efficiency conditions), enhanced vaults or wallets on the protocols, security against hacks and more.\n\n## **Tempus Passes Security Audit of Coinspect**\n\nWe are happy to announce the completion of our first audit by [Coinspect](https://www.coinspect.com/) who were able to find only 3 medium risk bugs that have now all been fixed.\n\nAs explained by Coinspect, no high-risk vulnerabilities that would result in user funds being stolen were identified from the source code. One of the medium-risk issues detected could have a high impact but there was a low likelihood of that event taking place. This bug has now also been fixed. Other bugs are related to the power of the pool owners and whether they could update the fees without constraints and that could have an adverse impact on users in case the accounts were compromised.\n\nFind Coinspect’s audit report [here](https://www.coinspect.com/doc/Coinspect%20-%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20-%20Tempus%20v211013.pdf).\n\n## **Tempus Security Audit Competition at Code 423n4**\n\nTempus is a future yield tokenization and fixed-rate protocol that allows users to optimize their existing exposure to variable yield based on their risk tolerance. As we continue to build on other protocols it is important for us to make sure our contracts are secured in case there is a failure on the protocols that we are building on.\n\nEnterprise audits do not necessarily guarantee the quality and robustness of smart contracts. Instead of organising a bug bounty program ourselves, we decided to partner with [Code 423n4](https://code423n4.com/) that creates incentivised weekly smart contract audit competitions that allow some of the most talented security researchers to do a thorough security audit of the smart contracts. It uses a novel competitive mechanism that allows anyone to help secure protocols and platforms without having to be a full-time professional auditor. This approach is designed to increase the depth and breadth of an audit while incentivizing security researchers to find the highest-risk and rarest bugs.\n\nIn addition to that, it does not follow the approach of ‘first person to turn in the bug gets the bounty’. Instead, they reward everyone’s contributions even if there are multiple submissions of the same bug.\n\nThe smart contract audit competition for Tempus began** on** **October 14, 2021, at 00:00 UTC**.\n\nThis contest ends **on October 20, 2021, at 23:59 UTC**.\n\n**We have allocated $50,000 USDC for anyone who is able to find bugs or can help us improve gas optimization on Tempus.**\n\n**Read more about the contest **[**here**](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus)** and start now!**\n\n## **About Tempus**\n\nTempus is a protocol where users can re-allocate the risk of interest rate fluctuations between each other. Users can deposit their yield-bearing tokens (such as stETH) which Tempus splits into tokenized principal and yield tokens. Those primitives can then be traded against each other through the custom Balancer v2 AMM. Tempus will offer capital-efficient fixed rate yields and high variable yields on various assets. For example, Tempus will be the first team to release fixed-rate ETH 2.0 staking through Lido.

Following the ethos of the project and its core developers, the current implementation of the protocol has been open-sourced — paving the way for a more accessible research and developer journey of Anoma.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PnediXxrICx7HafyHdFyyA.png)\n\n## In the Anoma codebase\n\nFrom the beginning of the year, the core developers of Anoma have been working continuously on the Anoma ledger, its intent gossip system, and the matchmaker system. The ledger is characterized by its integration with Tendermint BFT consensus and WASM, in addition to basic capabilities such as key-value store, transactions, and a command-line interface. Over the last moon cycle, the support for [validity predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/) on WASM, gas metering, and storage improvements among other changes were added to the ledger; the [intent gossip system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is able to broadcast and support simple token barter intents; and the [matchmaker](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is integrated with a WASM matching algorithm, allowing the system to match simple token barter intents. For a more in-depth view of the architecture of Anoma, take a look at the [documentation](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/).\n\n## Learning by playing with Anoma\n\nAs the design of the Anoma protocol is distinct in several ways, some features might appear unfamiliar, especially if you’re accustomed to protocols designed to be cryptocurrencies or platforms for arbitrary computation. Besides learning about Anoma via the growing base of resources, a swifter way for the playful minds would be by trying Anoma out.\n\nIf you’re interested in setting up your own local testnet of Anoma, you can find the guidelines for installing, building, operating an Anoma node [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#installing). You can also find the Rust docs for the Anoma crates [here](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/rustdoc/anoma/). Some of the most notable interactions involve validity predicates, creating and submitting *intents*, and operating the intent gossip and matchmaker systems.\n\n## Contributing to Anoma\n\nNothing would delight the core developers of Anoma more than feedback on the design, code, or documentation from the community at any scale — from typos to reviews on the design. Find the contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#how-to-contribute) and a list of open issues [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma/issues).\n\nIf you feel aligned with the vision of Anoma and would be interested in getting more involved with the project, know that the current team is growing and looking for more team members driven by the purpose of making privacy-preserving and self-sovereignty tools accessible. Take a look at this [list of open positions](https://heliax.dev/jobs), including but not limited to distributed systems research, zero-knowledge cryptography research and protocol engineering in Rust.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nAn upcoming development of the Anoma protocol is in the works and it combines the above with proof-of-stake and a dynamic validator selection mechanism. Later, support for [Ferveo](https://anoma.network/blog/ferveo-a-distributed-key-generation-scheme-for-front-running-protection) for front-running protection will be integrated, with other notable features to follow. The prototype is being refined along with the technical specifications and documentation in preparation for the very first experimental public testnet of Anoma. To stay tuned with the progress and updates, find us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anomanetwork), join the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RzN98vXbFt), or [receive updates](https://anoma.network/).\n", "timestamp": 1635971943, "digest": "JRLzzyvJMiMfMB1KDNusRMMCmFbw2mDTNiprNnkoGn0", "contributor": "0xcd9D9D81899bDf1ec8acc612E411d159DbA12d2F"}

Users can deposit their yield bearing tokens (such as stETH) which Tempus splits into tokenized principal and yield tokens. Those primitives can then be traded against each other through the custom Balancer v2 AMM. Tempus will offer capital-efficient fixed rate yields and high variable yields on various assets. For example, Tempus will be the first team to release fixed-rate ETH 2.0 staking through Lido. Tempus will also integrate Compound, Aave and Yearn.\n\n[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6gauHECShr) | [Github](https://github.com/tempus-finance) | [Medium](https://medium.com/@tempusfinance) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tempusfinance) | [Website](https://tempus.finance/)\n", "timestamp": 1635971918, "digest": "LDiqLGAE-Wq8AGtjX-6OccA8F-lY3N7IBJChu0SSFc4", "contributor": "0xcd9D9D81899bDf1ec8acc612E411d159DbA12d2F"}
{"id": "zXI0Uf7iyPWMAhTx9xPea3sEkH96TJ0yu7iN2mrIrHI", "title": "Introducing Anoma: A Blockchain for Private Asset-Agnostic Bartering", "body": "## What is Anoma?\n\nAnoma is a sovereign, proof-of-stake blockchain that enables private, asset-agnostic bartering among *any number of parties*. To illustrate the capabilities of Anoma, we’ll go through three examples and provide an overview of some of the key components of the protocol.\n\n## Private transfers with one asset type\n\nIn the first example, there are two participants: Alice, residing in San Francisco, and Bob, residing in Zürich. Alice and Bob had dinner together abroad, before they returned to their respective countries. To settle the bill for dinner, Alice wants to pay Bob in BTC.\n\nIn this example, two parties wish to transact, where the sender’s asset type (BTC) coincides with the receiver’s asset type. The Anoma blockchain is able to settle this transaction in zero-knowledge privacy. On Anoma, observers will not be able to infer any information about this transaction between Alice and Bob. Additionally, this transaction will look indistinguishable from any other transaction involving BTC, ETH, or any other cryptocurrencies.\n\n## Private transfers with two asset types\n\nIn the second example, Alice is on a business trip in Shanghai and visits 1984 Bookstore & Café, a trendy coffee shop in the bustling megacity. Alice, who holds primarily BTC in her mobile wallet, wants to pay for coffee.\n\nJust like the first example, this transaction involves two parties: Alice and the coffee shop. However, the sender’s asset type (BTC) does not coincide with the recipient’s asset type, as the coffee shop only accepts CNY or CNYC, a stablecoin form of 人民币. Through Anoma, Alice can spend BTC and the coffee shop can receive CNYC.\n\nUnder the hood, the Anoma blockchain automatically facilitates exchange between BTC and CNYC at the best market rate at the time, and all intermediate transactions (sending BTC, the BTC/CNYC exchange, and receiving CNYC) benefit from privacy provided by a multi-denomination zero-knowledge transfer circuit, which enables different types of assets to share one anonymity set. This way, the privacy guarantees will not be limited by the transaction volume of each individual asset.\n\nThis transaction is enabled by Anoma’s custom-tailored state machine, which has an built-in trade system supporting cross-chain asset transfers and settlement, a novel account system based on *validity predicates*, and an *intent matching system* with liquidity incentivization.\n\n## N-party bartering\n\nIn the third example there are three parties: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice holds BTC and wants DOT, Bob holds ETH and wants BTC, and Charlie holds DOT and wants ETH.\n\nIn this case, there are three parties, and no two can directly trade with each other because their desires are pairwise mismatched. The Anoma intent matching system and blockchain are able to match and settle the wants of all three participants at the same time. In other words, Anoma enables *bartering *among all three parties, as Alice, Bob, and Charlie do not need to agree on a common means of exchange in order to satisfy their individual wants.\n\nUsing the components described above, combined with custom zero-knowledge circuits, all interactions involved in an *𝐍*-party barter can benefit from the same privacy guarantees as a simple two-party asset transfer. Moreover, users of Anoma can barter any types of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fungible-assets, non-fungible assets or any upcoming types that represent more complex valuables.\n\nLastly, the Anoma blockchain is equipped with a distributed key generation and threshold decryption scheme to prevent reordering transactions and front-running trades.\n\n## The motivations behind Anoma\n\nThe motivations behind Anoma are threefold: the loss of individual financial privacy, the loss of local financial sovereignty, and the inability of humankind to coordinate at scale.\n\nFirst, the loss of financial privacy is fueled by the non-consensual usage of sensitive data about each individual’s financial activity by third parties. In mild cases, this results in intrusive commercial practices, such as targeted advertising or monetization of sensitive information. In more severe cases, this contributes to national and foreign governmental and corporate surveillance programs.\n\nSecond, the loss of local financial sovereignty results from the dependence on traditional financial systems — from electronic forms of fiat currencies to the permissioned backbone of international wire transfers. These systems, which often consist of a complex web of direct and indirect intermediaries, are susceptible to capture by governments, who can leverage them to enforce their sanctions on domestic or foreign residents.\n\nThird, humankind lacks the tools to solve problems of a cross-border nature which require the coordination of large groups of distinct economic agents. An existentially threatening subset of them, *collective action problems*, are currently only addressable through mechanisms that rely on the intervention of governments. Unfortunately, said problems often transcend national borders, thereby rendering the enforcement capabilities of Westphalian nation states inadequate.\n\n## The vision behind Anoma\n\nThe Anoma blockchain protocol aims to facilitate “*Self-Sovereign Communities”* by providing tools that grant increased control to individuals and communities’ of the systems governing their day-to-day aspects and activities, such as financial privacy, sovereignty, and coordination.\n\nAs the first instances of the Anoma protocol focus on granting privacy-preserving financial tools, the Anoma blockchain protocol places special emphasis on supporting any kind of asset and on zero-knowledge privacy regardless of the denomination of the assets.\n\nThe purpose of *undefining money *refers to the removal of any artificial constraints around what can be used as money or *means of exchange*, providing higher flexibility and control to the users of the protocol in deciding what to use — be it assets created by others or assets they created themselves. Anoma’s focus on financial self-sovereignty is also illustrated by the ***N***-party barter system, which facilitates asset-agnostic private cash in the simplest cases, but can assist in exchange, trades, and other financial activities of entire communities.\n\nFinally, in alignment with the vision, the design of the Anoma blockchain protocol scales via *fractal scaling*. Simply put, each Anoma blockchain instance is designed to integrate seamlessly with other instances, which can be specialized geographically (e.g. when Alice pays for coffee in Shanghai, this transaction is settled by the Chinese instance of Anoma) or are tailored to satisfy the needs and purposes of any real-world or virtual community (e.g. an Anoma instance that allows Animal Crossing players to trade furniture).\n\n## The team building Anoma\n\nThe [Anoma blockchain](https://anoma.network/) protocol is being built by [Heliax](https://heliax.dev/), a team currently composed of 23 cross-disciplinary members and supported by the [Anoma Foundation](http://anoma.foundation/).\n", "timestamp": 1635971952, "digest": "uGhxPHkyhnZPxTbIaei8ib9Xh8d5IbwB5P7Xe01y1oE", "contributor": "0xcd9D9D81899bDf1ec8acc612E411d159DbA12d2F"}

Security is one of the most formidable challenges for smart contract implementation in present times. There exist concerns of inefficiencies, security breaches and some broken codes that could lead to high or unnecessary costs for any user of a protocol.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges with smart contract implementation is the fact that they have an irreversible nature and users can lose a part or whole of their funds deposited in a contract that has not been written effectively.\n\nSmart contract auditing is therefore important for the better optimization of codes and improves the performance of the smart contract, in a way that also benefits the user of that contract (for example — gas efficiency conditions), enhanced vaults or wallets on the protocols, security against hacks and more.\n\n## **Tempus Passes Security Audit of Coinspect**\n\nWe are happy to announce the completion of our first audit by [Coinspect](https://www.coinspect.com/) who were able to find only 3 medium risk bugs that have now all been fixed.\n\nAs explained by Coinspect, no high-risk vulnerabilities that would result in user funds being stolen were identified from the source code. One of the medium-risk issues detected could have a high impact but there was a low likelihood of that event taking place. This bug has now also been fixed. Other bugs are related to the power of the pool owners and whether they could update the fees without constraints and that could have an adverse impact on users in case the accounts were compromised.\n\nFind Coinspect’s audit report [here](https://www.coinspect.com/doc/Coinspect%20-%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20-%20Tempus%20v211013.pdf).\n\n## **Tempus Security Audit Competition at Code 423n4**\n\nTempus is a future yield tokenization and fixed-rate protocol that allows users to optimize their existing exposure to variable yield based on their risk tolerance. As we continue to build on other protocols it is important for us to make sure our contracts are secured in case there is a failure on the protocols that we are building on.\n\nEnterprise audits do not necessarily guarantee the quality and robustness of smart contracts. Instead of organising a bug bounty program ourselves, we decided to partner with [Code 423n4](https://code423n4.com/) that creates incentivised weekly smart contract audit competitions that allow some of the most talented security researchers to do a thorough security audit of the smart contracts. It uses a novel competitive mechanism that allows anyone to help secure protocols and platforms without having to be a full-time professional auditor. This approach is designed to increase the depth and breadth of an audit while incentivizing security researchers to find the highest-risk and rarest bugs.\n\nIn addition to that, it does not follow the approach of ‘first person to turn in the bug gets the bounty’. Instead, they reward everyone’s contributions even if there are multiple submissions of the same bug.\n\nThe smart contract audit competition for Tempus began** on** **October 14, 2021, at 00:00 UTC**.\n\nThis contest ends **on October 20, 2021, at 23:59 UTC**.\n\n**We have allocated $50,000 USDC for anyone who is able to find bugs or can help us improve gas optimization on Tempus.**\n\n**Read more about the contest **[**here**](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus)** and start now!**\n\n## **About Tempus**\n\nTempus is a protocol where users can re-allocate the risk of interest rate fluctuations between each other.

{"id": "qxZW_6qw5pb1Z28c8KcNWXSvdBCnvho3jpoabc5otW8", "title": "Getting Started in NFTs", "body": "As a product that aims to help everyone in NFTs and not just the elite, we thought it would be helpful to provide simple and actionable advice to buy your first piece.\n\nWe want everyone to profit from using [NFT Ninja](https://www.nftninja.app) regardless of their knowledge or capital levels so we’re assuming little knowledge or acumen in this article.\n\nThere are lots of ways to actually buy an NFT with multiple competing exchanges, wallets, and marketplaces, but for the sake of simplicity, we’ve detailed one possible route, which is one that in our experience has low fees and a good user experience.\n\n## What You Need\n\n* $500+\n* Will to learn\n\nYes - really. You don’t need to be a techie or art collector to get involved.\n\nFor an “Amazonified” world spoiled by convenience, the infrastructure around NFTs is relatively convoluted so you’ll need to jump through a few hoops to secure your prize.\n\nIt’s nothing an hour or so won’t fix but in the near future, this will be much easier. See it as an advantage, in that if you’re willing to do a tiny bit of work to understand what you’re doing and why then you’re earlier than people who don’t.\n\n## Links\n\nIt’d be worth bookmarking the below because you’ll need them throughout the process.\n\n* [Crypto.com](https://www.crypto.com)\n* [Metamask.io](https://metamask.io/)\n* [OpenSea](https://www.opensea.io)\n\n## Step 1 – Buy Ethereum\n\nFirst off you need to purchase cryptocurrency using your fiat currency (USD, GBP etc). The coin with the most liquidity in NFTs is Ethereum, with lower levels of activity existing in other ecosystems as well, but for starters let’s just use ETH.\n\nHead to [Crypto.com](https://www.crypto.com) or download the [app](https://crypto.com/app), go through the necessary steps to be registered and verified, and buy ETH. It’s actually recommended to do as much on mobile as possible as mobile is inherently more secure than desktop.\n\nThe minimum viable amount you’ll need is around $1k, or 0.25 ETH at the time of writing. This is to cover the purchase of the NFT as well as the transaction costs (aka “gas fees”).\n\n## Step 2 – Setup MetaMask\n\nMetaMask is a browser extension wallet that allows you to easily access and interact with decentralized applications (aka dApps).\n\nFind out more at [metamask.io](https://www.metamask.io) or click on the below link to go straight to downloading the extension:\n\n[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en)\n\nWhen you're done adding it to your browser, it’s time to start setting up your wallet.\n\nWe’re assuming you’re new to all this, so you want to create a new wallet. The next steps are incredibly important in terms of securing your funds as there’s no one who can help if you mess it up.\n\nIf you’re curious, listen to this podcast episode to understand the need to go OTT when it comes to security in crypto:\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Wb0NT2kEXGaGxFqc4vSTD?si=2d4acc9b5c5c4ca7](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Wb0NT2kEXGaGxFqc4vSTD?si=2d4acc9b5c5c4ca7)\n\nTLDL; you will never be able to recover your funds if you lose your password and seed phrase. There’s no company or process that will help you recover what you’ve lost so be careful!\n\n### Securing Your Wallet: Password\n\nUnlike most application logins, you won’t be able to simply email yourself a forgotten password link.\n\nIt’s really important to create a secure, unique password for your MetaMask wallet. Please make sure to store this password securely, offline in a secure location like a safe.\n\n### Securing Your Wallet: Seed Phrase\n\nThe secret recovery phrase also referred to as the seed phrase, is a 12-word phrase that corresponds to a long, alphanumeric key that isn’t very practical for us to store/write.\n\nSimply put, your seed phrase is the foundation of your wallet and wallet contents. If you forget your password, you’ll need to rely on your seed phrase to recover access.\n\nSo, your seed phrase can be used to import your wallet on any device.\n\nTherefore, much like you wouldn’t share passwords, never share your recovery seed phrase with anyone. It’s good practice to store it offline in multiple, separate, secure locations. Check out Ledger for popular hardware solutions.\n\nAfter securely recording and storing away your recovery seed phrase, your wallet is ready to receive your ETH from Crypto.com!\n\n## Step 3 – Transfer ETH to MetaMask\n\nHaving set up MetaMask, you need to transfer your ETH from your exchange (Crypto.com).\n\nWhen opening your newly acquired MetaMask wallet, you can find your Ethereum address (a long string of letters and numbers, starting with 0x) at the top.\n\nBecause of the length of addresses, it’s often most easy to identify an address by a few characters from the beginning and end of an address. To unveil the entire address though, just hover over the characters, and click to copy the address to your clipboard.\n\nThe full result is your Ethereum address. You’ll need this address if you wish to be able to receive ETH from Crypto.com\n\nSimply paste your MetaMask wallet address into the relevant field when withdrawing from Crypto.com in order to move funds from there to MetaMask.\n\nGreat – your MetaMask is funded and you’re ready to set the NFT world alight.\n\n## Step 4 – Purchase NFT\n\nYou have two options here:\n\n* Minting an NFT\n* Buying on the secondary market\n\n### Minting\n\nAssuming you believe in a new project, and you think the price of an NFT will only go up, then you will maximize profits by being early and “minting” an NFT. This means you’re in the first batch of people who can get their hands on an NFT.\n\nUsually, you will randomly generate an NFT with certain traits and attributes that are rare or common, or more likely somewhere in between.\n\nYou can then hold this or sell it on OpenSea.\n\n### Secondary\n\nOpenSea is by and large the home of the secondary NFT market.\n\nPeople sell their minted NFTs or ones they’ve bought on OpenSea, generally for a profit although with all markets people sell for a loss if they think the price is only going down.\n\n## How to Set Up and Navigate Your Account\n\nAccounts on OpenSea, like nearly all of Web 3.0, are directly tied to your Ethereum address.\n\nTherefore, to set up an account on OpenSea, you’ll need to have an Ethereum address and wallet with compatibility with Web 3.0 and decentralized applications. The most popular wallet option is MetaMask, but with OpenSea, you can connect with a handful of other wallet options.\n\nIf you already have a wallet, you can head to [OpenSea.io](https://opensea.io/) and connect to the site using the wallet icon in the top right corner of the page.\n\n**IMAGE**\n\nAfter choosing the appropriate wallet provider and following the connection steps, you’re now “signed in” to OpenSea.\n\n## How to Find the Perfect NFT on OpenSea\n\nHere’s where [NFT Ninja](http://www.nftninja.app) comes in. You can either browse OpenSea collections with basic information on, or have greater insight when it comes to how rare each NFT is.\n\n**IMAGE**\n\nAs you can see, you can run any collection on OpenSea through the platform and get the full rarity rankings based on our algorithm.

Security is one of the most formidable challenges for smart contract implementation in present times. There exist concerns of inefficiencies, security breaches and some broken codes that could lead to high or unnecessary costs for any user of a protocol.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges with smart contract implementation is the fact that they have an irreversible nature and users can lose a part or whole of their funds deposited in a contract that has not been written effectively.\n\nSmart contract auditing is therefore important for the better optimization of codes and improves the performance of the smart contract, in a way that also benefits the user of that contract (for example — gas efficiency conditions), enhanced vaults or wallets on the protocols, security against hacks and more.\n\n## **Tempus Passes Security Audit of Coinspect**\n\nWe are happy to announce the completion of our first audit by [Coinspect](https://www.coinspect.com/) who were able to find only 3 medium risk bugs that have now all been fixed.\n\nAs explained by Coinspect, no high-risk vulnerabilities that would result in user funds being stolen were identified from the source code. One of the medium-risk issues detected could have a high impact but there was a low likelihood of that event taking place. This bug has now also been fixed. Other bugs are related to the power of the pool owners and whether they could update the fees without constraints and that could have an adverse impact on users in case the accounts were compromised.\n\nFind Coinspect’s audit report [here](https://www.coinspect.com/doc/Coinspect%20-%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20-%20Tempus%20v211013.pdf).\n\n## **Tempus Security Audit Competition at Code 423n4**\n\nTempus is a future yield tokenization and fixed-rate protocol that allows users to optimize their existing exposure to variable yield based on their risk tolerance. As we continue to build on other protocols it is important for us to make sure our contracts are secured in case there is a failure on the protocols that we are building on.\n\nEnterprise audits do not necessarily guarantee the quality and robustness of smart contracts. Instead of organising a bug bounty program ourselves, we decided to partner with [Code 423n4](https://code423n4.com/) that creates incentivised weekly smart contract audit competitions that allow some of the most talented security researchers to do a thorough security audit of the smart contracts. It uses a novel competitive mechanism that allows anyone to help secure protocols and platforms without having to be a full-time professional auditor. This approach is designed to increase the depth and breadth of an audit while incentivizing security researchers to find the highest-risk and rarest bugs.\n\nIn addition to that, it does not follow the approach of ‘first person to turn in the bug gets the bounty’. Instead, they reward everyone’s contributions even if there are multiple submissions of the same bug.\n\nThe smart contract audit competition for Tempus began** on** **October 14, 2021, at 00:00 UTC**.\n\nThis contest ends **on October 20, 2021, at 23:59 UTC**.\n\n**We have allocated $50,000 USDC for anyone who is able to find bugs or can help us improve gas optimization on Tempus.**\n\n**Read more about the contest **[**here**](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus)** and start now!**\n\n## **About Tempus**\n\nTempus is a protocol where users can re-allocate the risk of interest rate fluctuations between each other.

Today, we’re thrilled to announce Anoma’s first public testnet: Feigenbaum.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*ygP0CgVBnYjRuQNc)\n\nAnnouncing Feigenbaum: Anoma’s first public testnet\n\n## What is Feigenbaum?\n\nFeigenbaum is Anoma’s first public test network, developed and currently maintained by the team building Anoma. It is the first milestone in Anoma’s public testnet roadmap, which has been constructed to enable a progressive deployment of components and features, and to facilitate the participation of early users in testing and interacting with the implementation– thereby parallelizing the development of further features, and the gathering and integration of external user feedback.\n\n*Fractals* are a recurring theme in the design of Anoma, noticeable, for instance, in how the protocol upgrade mechanism works or in how Anoma’s ecosystem scales via the co-existence of many instances. Thus, Anoma’s protocol version names take inspiration from fractals, beginning with the Feigenbaum testnet, named after the [Feigenbaum attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map), a deterministic fractal with a very low [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension) dimension.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Upgrades](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-upgrades/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Scaling](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-scaling/)\n\n## What features does Feigenbaum support?\n\nThe current version of the protocol provides an early demonstration of the intent gossip and matchmaker components in the peer-to-peer layer, which are very particular to the design of the Anoma protocol and unprecedented in the architecture of other Layer 1 blockchains. It also offers a playground for customizing and deploying validity predicates and transactions in Rust. Anoma implements proof-of-stake (PoS) as its sibyl resistance mechanism and Tendermint, a variant of the practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism (PBFT). Finally, interactions with the protocol are facilitated via the command-line interface (CLI) client, node, and wallet.\n\n## What can you do on Feigenbaum?\n\nIn addition to the basic interactions with the ledger, Feigenbaum already enables experimentation for users who might be interested in operating and directly participating in the network at mainnet launch.\n\nThe roles\\* supported are operating validator nodes, intent gossip, and matchmaking nodes. For builders that enjoy playing with Rust, we encourage them to try [customizing validity predicates](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/ledger/customize.html), transactions, or even [the matchmaker node](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/intent-gossip-and-matchmaker.html). For early end-users that are not intimidated by the command-line, it’s not too early to start with the basics, such as [setting up a wallet](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/wallet.html) with addresses, getting some testnet tokens from the faucet account, making transfers, and staking– or, for the most adventurous ones, a primer to Anoma as a [multivariate, multivariable protocol](https://twitter.com/awasunyin/status/1422508932635967489?s=20), you can start crafting custom intents and deploying them directly to the intents gossip network.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Intent Gossip & Matchmaking system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Validity Predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/)\n\n\\*[Stay tuned](https://twitter.com/anomanetwork) for a new series of articles on our blog that explain each role in the Anoma Network!\n\n## How do I participate in the Feigenbaum testnet?\n\nAs a public, permissionless testnet, anyone can join anonymously by pulling the code from the [repository](https://github.com/anoma/anoma/releases/tag/v0.2.0) and following the instructions in the [docs](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/).\n\nA few members from the team building Anoma will also be participating in the Feigenbaum testnet to ensure that it runs smoothly. Furthermore, some will be available on Anoma’s [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/RzN98vXbFt) (#feigenbaum channel) to help out with installation or any other issues, as well as for gathering user feedback.\n\nFinally, to stay up-to-date on all news and communications related to Anoma’s Feigenbaum and future testnets, we recommend that you fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/GLzTF37vwokbFYeW9) to receive the testnet newsletter.\n", "timestamp": 1635972095, "digest": "-Qr4jxiztprVVQCzqsNWA0y3ow08Nf4gqocn8yndrlc", "contributor": "0xE6045502603ab01690A5e41F94aC64Ab704E8F9f"}

Following the ethos of the project and its core developers, the current implementation of the protocol has been open-sourced — paving the way for a more accessible research and developer journey of Anoma.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PnediXxrICx7HafyHdFyyA.png)\n\n## In the Anoma codebase\n\nFrom the beginning of the year, the core developers of Anoma have been working continuously on the Anoma ledger, its intent gossip system, and the matchmaker system. The ledger is characterized by its integration with Tendermint BFT consensus and WASM, in addition to basic capabilities such as key-value store, transactions, and a command-line interface. Over the last moon cycle, the support for [validity predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/) on WASM, gas metering, and storage improvements among other changes were added to the ledger; the [intent gossip system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is able to broadcast and support simple token barter intents; and the [matchmaker](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is integrated with a WASM matching algorithm, allowing the system to match simple token barter intents. For a more in-depth view of the architecture of Anoma, take a look at the [documentation](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/).\n\n## Learning by playing with Anoma\n\nAs the design of the Anoma protocol is distinct in several ways, some features might appear unfamiliar, especially if you’re accustomed to protocols designed to be cryptocurrencies or platforms for arbitrary computation. Besides learning about Anoma via the growing base of resources, a swifter way for the playful minds would be by trying Anoma out.\n\nIf you’re interested in setting up your own local testnet of Anoma, you can find the guidelines for installing, building, operating an Anoma node [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#installing). You can also find the Rust docs for the Anoma crates [here](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/rustdoc/anoma/). Some of the most notable interactions involve validity predicates, creating and submitting *intents*, and operating the intent gossip and matchmaker systems.\n\n## Contributing to Anoma\n\nNothing would delight the core developers of Anoma more than feedback on the design, code, or documentation from the community at any scale — from typos to reviews on the design. Find the contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#how-to-contribute) and a list of open issues [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma/issues).\n\nIf you feel aligned with the vision of Anoma and would be interested in getting more involved with the project, know that the current team is growing and looking for more team members driven by the purpose of making privacy-preserving and self-sovereignty tools accessible. Take a look at this [list of open positions](https://heliax.dev/jobs), including but not limited to distributed systems research, zero-knowledge cryptography research and protocol engineering in Rust.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nAn upcoming development of the Anoma protocol is in the works and it combines the above with proof-of-stake and a dynamic validator selection mechanism. Later, support for [Ferveo](https://anoma.network/blog/ferveo-a-distributed-key-generation-scheme-for-front-running-protection) for front-running protection will be integrated, with other notable features to follow. The prototype is being refined along with the technical specifications and documentation in preparation for the very first experimental public testnet of Anoma. To stay tuned with the progress and updates, find us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anomanetwork), join the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RzN98vXbFt), or [receive updates](https://anoma.network/).\n", "timestamp": 1635972078, "digest": "3xQ8VG0N851IQP1NoVU_V8UmbEw3WpoJyIA55K0gOgw", "contributor": "0xE6045502603ab01690A5e41F94aC64Ab704E8F9f"}
{"id": "qU0-VFnWV2kauet42sdDb_-DeLa9xWdJgoZkAhjWhYQ", "title": "Introducing Anoma: A Blockchain for Private Asset-Agnostic Bartering", "body": "## What is Anoma?\n\nAnoma is a sovereign, proof-of-stake blockchain that enables private, asset-agnostic bartering among *any number of parties*. To illustrate the capabilities of Anoma, we’ll go through three examples and provide an overview of some of the key components of the protocol.\n\n## Private transfers with one asset type\n\nIn the first example, there are two participants: Alice, residing in San Francisco, and Bob, residing in Zürich. Alice and Bob had dinner together abroad, before they returned to their respective countries. To settle the bill for dinner, Alice wants to pay Bob in BTC.\n\nIn this example, two parties wish to transact, where the sender’s asset type (BTC) coincides with the receiver’s asset type. The Anoma blockchain is able to settle this transaction in zero-knowledge privacy. On Anoma, observers will not be able to infer any information about this transaction between Alice and Bob. Additionally, this transaction will look indistinguishable from any other transaction involving BTC, ETH, or any other cryptocurrencies.\n\n## Private transfers with two asset types\n\nIn the second example, Alice is on a business trip in Shanghai and visits 1984 Bookstore & Café, a trendy coffee shop in the bustling megacity. Alice, who holds primarily BTC in her mobile wallet, wants to pay for coffee.\n\nJust like the first example, this transaction involves two parties: Alice and the coffee shop. However, the sender’s asset type (BTC) does not coincide with the recipient’s asset type, as the coffee shop only accepts CNY or CNYC, a stablecoin form of 人民币. Through Anoma, Alice can spend BTC and the coffee shop can receive CNYC.\n\nUnder the hood, the Anoma blockchain automatically facilitates exchange between BTC and CNYC at the best market rate at the time, and all intermediate transactions (sending BTC, the BTC/CNYC exchange, and receiving CNYC) benefit from privacy provided by a multi-denomination zero-knowledge transfer circuit, which enables different types of assets to share one anonymity set. This way, the privacy guarantees will not be limited by the transaction volume of each individual asset.\n\nThis transaction is enabled by Anoma’s custom-tailored state machine, which has an built-in trade system supporting cross-chain asset transfers and settlement, a novel account system based on *validity predicates*, and an *intent matching system* with liquidity incentivization.\n\n## N-party bartering\n\nIn the third example there are three parties: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice holds BTC and wants DOT, Bob holds ETH and wants BTC, and Charlie holds DOT and wants ETH.\n\nIn this case, there are three parties, and no two can directly trade with each other because their desires are pairwise mismatched. The Anoma intent matching system and blockchain are able to match and settle the wants of all three participants at the same time. In other words, Anoma enables *bartering *among all three parties, as Alice, Bob, and Charlie do not need to agree on a common means of exchange in order to satisfy their individual wants.\n\nUsing the components described above, combined with custom zero-knowledge circuits, all interactions involved in an *𝐍*-party barter can benefit from the same privacy guarantees as a simple two-party asset transfer. Moreover, users of Anoma can barter any types of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fungible-assets, non-fungible assets or any upcoming types that represent more complex valuables.\n\nLastly, the Anoma blockchain is equipped with a distributed key generation and threshold decryption scheme to prevent reordering transactions and front-running trades.\n\n## The motivations behind Anoma\n\nThe motivations behind Anoma are threefold: the loss of individual financial privacy, the loss of local financial sovereignty, and the inability of humankind to coordinate at scale.\n\nFirst, the loss of financial privacy is fueled by the non-consensual usage of sensitive data about each individual’s financial activity by third parties. In mild cases, this results in intrusive commercial practices, such as targeted advertising or monetization of sensitive information. In more severe cases, this contributes to national and foreign governmental and corporate surveillance programs.\n\nSecond, the loss of local financial sovereignty results from the dependence on traditional financial systems — from electronic forms of fiat currencies to the permissioned backbone of international wire transfers. These systems, which often consist of a complex web of direct and indirect intermediaries, are susceptible to capture by governments, who can leverage them to enforce their sanctions on domestic or foreign residents.\n\nThird, humankind lacks the tools to solve problems of a cross-border nature which require the coordination of large groups of distinct economic agents. An existentially threatening subset of them, *collective action problems*, are currently only addressable through mechanisms that rely on the intervention of governments. Unfortunately, said problems often transcend national borders, thereby rendering the enforcement capabilities of Westphalian nation states inadequate.\n\n## The vision behind Anoma\n\nThe Anoma blockchain protocol aims to facilitate “*Self-Sovereign Communities”* by providing tools that grant increased control to individuals and communities’ of the systems governing their day-to-day aspects and activities, such as financial privacy, sovereignty, and coordination.\n\nAs the first instances of the Anoma protocol focus on granting privacy-preserving financial tools, the Anoma blockchain protocol places special emphasis on supporting any kind of asset and on zero-knowledge privacy regardless of the denomination of the assets.\n\nThe purpose of *undefining money *refers to the removal of any artificial constraints around what can be used as money or *means of exchange*, providing higher flexibility and control to the users of the protocol in deciding what to use — be it assets created by others or assets they created themselves.

Security is one of the most formidable challenges for smart contract implementation in present times. There exist concerns of inefficiencies, security breaches and some broken codes that could lead to high or unnecessary costs for any user of a protocol.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges with smart contract implementation is the fact that they have an irreversible nature and users can lose a part or whole of their funds deposited in a contract that has not been written effectively.\n\nSmart contract auditing is therefore important for the better optimization of codes and improves the performance of the smart contract, in a way that also benefits the user of that contract (for example — gas efficiency conditions), enhanced vaults or wallets on the protocols, security against hacks and more.\n\n## **Tempus Passes Security Audit of Coinspect**\n\nWe are happy to announce the completion of our first audit by [Coinspect](https://www.coinspect.com/) who were able to find only 3 medium risk bugs that have now all been fixed.\n\nAs explained by Coinspect, no high-risk vulnerabilities that would result in user funds being stolen were identified from the source code. One of the medium-risk issues detected could have a high impact but there was a low likelihood of that event taking place. This bug has now also been fixed. Other bugs are related to the power of the pool owners and whether they could update the fees without constraints and that could have an adverse impact on users in case the accounts were compromised.\n\nFind Coinspect’s audit report [here](https://www.coinspect.com/doc/Coinspect%20-%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20-%20Tempus%20v211013.pdf).\n\n## **Tempus Security Audit Competition at Code 423n4**\n\nTempus is a future yield tokenization and fixed-rate protocol that allows users to optimize their existing exposure to variable yield based on their risk tolerance. As we continue to build on other protocols it is important for us to make sure our contracts are secured in case there is a failure on the protocols that we are building on.\n\nEnterprise audits do not necessarily guarantee the quality and robustness of smart contracts. Instead of organising a bug bounty program ourselves, we decided to partner with [Code 423n4](https://code423n4.com/) that creates incentivised weekly smart contract audit competitions that allow some of the most talented security researchers to do a thorough security audit of the smart contracts. It uses a novel competitive mechanism that allows anyone to help secure protocols and platforms without having to be a full-time professional auditor. This approach is designed to increase the depth and breadth of an audit while incentivizing security researchers to find the highest-risk and rarest bugs.\n\nIn addition to that, it does not follow the approach of ‘first person to turn in the bug gets the bounty’. Instead, they reward everyone’s contributions even if there are multiple submissions of the same bug.\n\nThe smart contract audit competition for Tempus began** on** **October 14, 2021, at 00:00 UTC**.\n\nThis contest ends **on October 20, 2021, at 23:59 UTC**.\n\n**We have allocated $50,000 USDC for anyone who is able to find bugs or can help us improve gas optimization on Tempus.**\n\n**Read more about the contest **[**here**](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus)** and start now!**\n\n## **About Tempus**\n\nTempus is a protocol where users can re-allocate the risk of interest rate fluctuations between each other.

Today, we’re thrilled to announce Anoma’s first public testnet: Feigenbaum.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*ygP0CgVBnYjRuQNc)\n\nAnnouncing Feigenbaum: Anoma’s first public testnet\n\n## What is Feigenbaum?\n\nFeigenbaum is Anoma’s first public test network, developed and currently maintained by the team building Anoma. It is the first milestone in Anoma’s public testnet roadmap, which has been constructed to enable a progressive deployment of components and features, and to facilitate the participation of early users in testing and interacting with the implementation– thereby parallelizing the development of further features, and the gathering and integration of external user feedback.\n\n*Fractals* are a recurring theme in the design of Anoma, noticeable, for instance, in how the protocol upgrade mechanism works or in how Anoma’s ecosystem scales via the co-existence of many instances. Thus, Anoma’s protocol version names take inspiration from fractals, beginning with the Feigenbaum testnet, named after the [Feigenbaum attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map), a deterministic fractal with a very low [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension) dimension.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Upgrades](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-upgrades/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Scaling](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-scaling/)\n\n## What features does Feigenbaum support?\n\nThe current version of the protocol provides an early demonstration of the intent gossip and matchmaker components in the peer-to-peer layer, which are very particular to the design of the Anoma protocol and unprecedented in the architecture of other Layer 1 blockchains. It also offers a playground for customizing and deploying validity predicates and transactions in Rust. Anoma implements proof-of-stake (PoS) as its sibyl resistance mechanism and Tendermint, a variant of the practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism (PBFT). Finally, interactions with the protocol are facilitated via the command-line interface (CLI) client, node, and wallet.\n\n## What can you do on Feigenbaum?\n\nIn addition to the basic interactions with the ledger, Feigenbaum already enables experimentation for users who might be interested in operating and directly participating in the network at mainnet launch.\n\nThe roles\\* supported are operating validator nodes, intent gossip, and matchmaking nodes. For builders that enjoy playing with Rust, we encourage them to try [customizing validity predicates](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/ledger/customize.html), transactions, or even [the matchmaker node](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/intent-gossip-and-matchmaker.html). For early end-users that are not intimidated by the command-line, it’s not too early to start with the basics, such as [setting up a wallet](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/wallet.html) with addresses, getting some testnet tokens from the faucet account, making transfers, and staking– or, for the most adventurous ones, a primer to Anoma as a [multivariate, multivariable protocol](https://twitter.com/awasunyin/status/1422508932635967489?s=20), you can start crafting custom intents and deploying them directly to the intents gossip network.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Intent Gossip & Matchmaking system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Validity Predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/)\n\n\\*[Stay tuned](https://twitter.com/anomanetwork) for a new series of articles on our blog that explain each role in the Anoma Network!\n\n## How do I participate in the Feigenbaum testnet?\n\nAs a public, permissionless testnet, anyone can join anonymously by pulling the code from the [repository](https://github.com/anoma/anoma/releases/tag/v0.2.0) and following the instructions in the [docs](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/).\n\nA few members from the team building Anoma will also be participating in the Feigenbaum testnet to ensure that it runs smoothly. Furthermore, some will be available on Anoma’s [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/RzN98vXbFt) (#feigenbaum channel) to help out with installation or any other issues, as well as for gathering user feedback.\n\nFinally, to stay up-to-date on all news and communications related to Anoma’s Feigenbaum and future testnets, we recommend that you fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/GLzTF37vwokbFYeW9) to receive the testnet newsletter.\n", "timestamp": 1635972123, "digest": "XJqdxouE_Ej9MIclcZ0yInmnDhEUkUVgYg6ML_rqFfA", "contributor": "0xec9c8676F97d6B8FD6972527E2A3B45B8f64A366"}
{"id": "J920NsFKVSzJsdepQjrw15mrAw83kZtR_3Blq0ZB4go", "title": "Introducing Anoma: A Blockchain for Private Asset-Agnostic Bartering", "body": "## What is Anoma?\n\nAnoma is a sovereign, proof-of-stake blockchain that enables private, asset-agnostic bartering among *any number of parties*. To illustrate the capabilities of Anoma, we’ll go through three examples and provide an overview of some of the key components of the protocol.\n\n## Private transfers with one asset type\n\nIn the first example, there are two participants: Alice, residing in San Francisco, and Bob, residing in Zürich. Alice and Bob had dinner together abroad, before they returned to their respective countries. To settle the bill for dinner, Alice wants to pay Bob in BTC.\n\nIn this example, two parties wish to transact, where the sender’s asset type (BTC) coincides with the receiver’s asset type. The Anoma blockchain is able to settle this transaction in zero-knowledge privacy. On Anoma, observers will not be able to infer any information about this transaction between Alice and Bob. Additionally, this transaction will look indistinguishable from any other transaction involving BTC, ETH, or any other cryptocurrencies.\n\n## Private transfers with two asset types\n\nIn the second example, Alice is on a business trip in Shanghai and visits 1984 Bookstore & Café, a trendy coffee shop in the bustling megacity. Alice, who holds primarily BTC in her mobile wallet, wants to pay for coffee.\n\nJust like the first example, this transaction involves two parties: Alice and the coffee shop. However, the sender’s asset type (BTC) does not coincide with the recipient’s asset type, as the coffee shop only accepts CNY or CNYC, a stablecoin form of 人民币. Through Anoma, Alice can spend BTC and the coffee shop can receive CNYC.\n\nUnder the hood, the Anoma blockchain automatically facilitates exchange between BTC and CNYC at the best market rate at the time, and all intermediate transactions (sending BTC, the BTC/CNYC exchange, and receiving CNYC) benefit from privacy provided by a multi-denomination zero-knowledge transfer circuit, which enables different types of assets to share one anonymity set. This way, the privacy guarantees will not be limited by the transaction volume of each individual asset.\n\nThis transaction is enabled by Anoma’s custom-tailored state machine, which has an built-in trade system supporting cross-chain asset transfers and settlement, a novel account system based on *validity predicates*, and an *intent matching system* with liquidity incentivization.\n\n## N-party bartering\n\nIn the third example there are three parties: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice holds BTC and wants DOT, Bob holds ETH and wants BTC, and Charlie holds DOT and wants ETH.\n\nIn this case, there are three parties, and no two can directly trade with each other because their desires are pairwise mismatched. The Anoma intent matching system and blockchain are able to match and settle the wants of all three participants at the same time. In other words, Anoma enables *bartering *among all three parties, as Alice, Bob, and Charlie do not need to agree on a common means of exchange in order to satisfy their individual wants.\n\nUsing the components described above, combined with custom zero-knowledge circuits, all interactions involved in an *𝐍*-party barter can benefit from the same privacy guarantees as a simple two-party asset transfer. Moreover, users of Anoma can barter any types of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fungible-assets, non-fungible assets or any upcoming types that represent more complex valuables.\n\nLastly, the Anoma blockchain is equipped with a distributed key generation and threshold decryption scheme to prevent reordering transactions and front-running trades.\n\n## The motivations behind Anoma\n\nThe motivations behind Anoma are threefold: the loss of individual financial privacy, the loss of local financial sovereignty, and the inability of humankind to coordinate at scale.\n\nFirst, the loss of financial privacy is fueled by the non-consensual usage of sensitive data about each individual’s financial activity by third parties. In mild cases, this results in intrusive commercial practices, such as targeted advertising or monetization of sensitive information. In more severe cases, this contributes to national and foreign governmental and corporate surveillance programs.\n\nSecond, the loss of local financial sovereignty results from the dependence on traditional financial systems — from electronic forms of fiat currencies to the permissioned backbone of international wire transfers. These systems, which often consist of a complex web of direct and indirect intermediaries, are susceptible to capture by governments, who can leverage them to enforce their sanctions on domestic or foreign residents.\n\nThird, humankind lacks the tools to solve problems of a cross-border nature which require the coordination of large groups of distinct economic agents. An existentially threatening subset of them, *collective action problems*, are currently only addressable through mechanisms that rely on the intervention of governments. Unfortunately, said problems often transcend national borders, thereby rendering the enforcement capabilities of Westphalian nation states inadequate.\n\n## The vision behind Anoma\n\nThe Anoma blockchain protocol aims to facilitate “*Self-Sovereign Communities”* by providing tools that grant increased control to individuals and communities’ of the systems governing their day-to-day aspects and activities, such as financial privacy, sovereignty, and coordination.\n\nAs the first instances of the Anoma protocol focus on granting privacy-preserving financial tools, the Anoma blockchain protocol places special emphasis on supporting any kind of asset and on zero-knowledge privacy regardless of the denomination of the assets.\n\nThe purpose of *undefining money *refers to the removal of any artificial constraints around what can be used as money or *means of exchange*, providing higher flexibility and control to the users of the protocol in deciding what to use — be it assets created by others or assets they created themselves. Anoma’s focus on financial self-sovereignty is also illustrated by the ***N***-party barter system, which facilitates asset-agnostic private cash in the simplest cases, but can assist in exchange, trades, and other financial activities of entire communities.\n\nFinally, in alignment with the vision, the design of the Anoma blockchain protocol scales via *fractal scaling*. Simply put, each Anoma blockchain instance is designed to integrate seamlessly with other instances, which can be specialized geographically (e.g. when Alice pays for coffee in Shanghai, this transaction is settled by the Chinese instance of Anoma) or are tailored to satisfy the needs and purposes of any real-world or virtual community (e.g. an Anoma instance that allows Animal Crossing players to trade furniture).\n\n## The team building Anoma\n\nThe [Anoma blockchain](https://anoma.network/) protocol is being built by [Heliax](https://heliax.dev/), a team currently composed of 23 cross-disciplinary members and supported by the [Anoma Foundation](http://anoma.foundation/).\n", "timestamp": 1635972131, "digest": "rRY3eR32iZJC__HR3jkyAdaAH8KswnlOZn4XqmrRtGw", "contributor": "0xec9c8676F97d6B8FD6972527E2A3B45B8f64A366"}

Following the ethos of the project and its core developers, the current implementation of the protocol has been open-sourced — paving the way for a more accessible research and developer journey of Anoma.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PnediXxrICx7HafyHdFyyA.png)\n\n## In the Anoma codebase\n\nFrom the beginning of the year, the core developers of Anoma have been working continuously on the Anoma ledger, its intent gossip system, and the matchmaker system. The ledger is characterized by its integration with Tendermint BFT consensus and WASM, in addition to basic capabilities such as key-value store, transactions, and a command-line interface. Over the last moon cycle, the support for [validity predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/) on WASM, gas metering, and storage improvements among other changes were added to the ledger; the [intent gossip system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is able to broadcast and support simple token barter intents; and the [matchmaker](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is integrated with a WASM matching algorithm, allowing the system to match simple token barter intents. For a more in-depth view of the architecture of Anoma, take a look at the [documentation](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/).\n\n## Learning by playing with Anoma\n\nAs the design of the Anoma protocol is distinct in several ways, some features might appear unfamiliar, especially if you’re accustomed to protocols designed to be cryptocurrencies or platforms for arbitrary computation. Besides learning about Anoma via the growing base of resources, a swifter way for the playful minds would be by trying Anoma out.\n\nIf you’re interested in setting up your own local testnet of Anoma, you can find the guidelines for installing, building, operating an Anoma node [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#installing). You can also find the Rust docs for the Anoma crates [here](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/rustdoc/anoma/). Some of the most notable interactions involve validity predicates, creating and submitting *intents*, and operating the intent gossip and matchmaker systems.\n\n## Contributing to Anoma\n\nNothing would delight the core developers of Anoma more than feedback on the design, code, or documentation from the community at any scale — from typos to reviews on the design. Find the contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#how-to-contribute) and a list of open issues [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma/issues).\n\nIf you feel aligned with the vision of Anoma and would be interested in getting more involved with the project, know that the current team is growing and looking for more team members driven by the purpose of making privacy-preserving and self-sovereignty tools accessible. Take a look at this [list of open positions](https://heliax.dev/jobs), including but not limited to distributed systems research, zero-knowledge cryptography research and protocol engineering in Rust.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nAn upcoming development of the Anoma protocol is in the works and it combines the above with proof-of-stake and a dynamic validator selection mechanism. Later, support for [Ferveo](https://anoma.network/blog/ferveo-a-distributed-key-generation-scheme-for-front-running-protection) for front-running protection will be integrated, with other notable features to follow. The prototype is being refined along with the technical specifications and documentation in preparation for the very first experimental public testnet of Anoma.

Users can deposit their yield bearing tokens (such as stETH) which Tempus splits into tokenized principal and yield tokens. Those primitives can then be traded against each other through the custom Balancer v2 AMM. Tempus will offer capital-efficient fixed rate yields and high variable yields on various assets. For example, Tempus will be the first team to release fixed-rate ETH 2.0 staking through Lido. Tempus will also integrate Compound, Aave and Yearn.\n\n[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6gauHECShr) | [Github](https://github.com/tempus-finance) | [Medium](https://medium.com/@tempusfinance) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tempusfinance) | [Website](https://tempus.finance/)\n", "timestamp": 1635972167, "digest": "BoT0v_4Q0d3fgyybunLWHUqvHHLhbuDYhcJ1Ak1Lfb8", "contributor": "0xec9c8676F97d6B8FD6972527E2A3B45B8f64A366"}
{"id": "2oyBYcjR7AKSdYrKjXLe8b2Cw0M4kJyUWgfyF8pNTk4", "title": "Re-imagining Creative Ecosystem Funding", "body": "Welcome to [Unnamed Fund](https://unnamed.fund/) —  a cooperatively controlled creative ecosystem fund.\n\nWe're a group of creatives working towards sustainable funding solutions for artists, creative practice, and creative enterprises. As members and alumni of [NEW INC](https://newinc.org/), the New Museum’s incubator, we came together with the goal of building community focused solutions to, and imagining new futures for funding within our ecosystem.\n\n\n---\n\n### What would it look like to develop an experimental, community-led, cooperatively controlled fund for the creative ecosystem?\n\nUnnamed Fund is a cooperatively controlled creative ecosystem fund. Part new funding model and part provocation, this experimental fund seeks to re-imagine existing models for funding creative, artistic, and entrepreneurial projects by sustaining those underserved by traditional funding through the equitable distribution of capital, across multiple impact outcomes.\n\nResponding to the deficit of available funding resources for creators, in particular those underserved by traditional models, a core group of members have organically come together to shape this experiment. United around the principles of distributed governance, and an excitement for community-led solutions, we began to develop ideas for a cooperatively governed fund through slow, organic, and intentional work.\n\nThe fund is currently in a phase of public research - through which we will publish our unfinished thesis, refined through research and conversations with community members. We expect this research phase to continue for the rest of 2021, with a view to launching an initial round of funding in Spring of 2022. This initial round will launch as a public/private beta, working directly with NEW INC and its community of creatives as a test case for the viability of the fund.\n\n### The Problem With Funding\n\nThe distribution of capital within the creative and entrepreneurial ecosystem is problematic at best. At worst, it actively and deliberately excludes diverse creators and founders from access to capital, creating a cultural and economic echo chamber under a singular narrative. This is particularly concerning as it narrows the focus of what it means to be successful, with a predisposition towards unsustainable growth, and products over people.\n\nWhen we look to other nations, there are a multiplicity of support options for creative endeavors that are not linked to private wealth. But here in the US, there is a serious dearth of unrestricted funding options, leaving the survival of the creative community/economy at the mercy of venture capitalists, foundations, institutions, crowdfunding, and philanthropy.\n\nTraditional funding models such as investment are plagued with issues of inaccessibility, discrimination, and top-down decision making (to name a few), but a more elegant, equitable, and sustainable alternative has yet to emerge with any semblance of viability. While these models present compelling opportunities for funding projects in the creative ecosystem, systemic inequality, intermittent availability, and a virtually non-existent framework for financial sustainability leave little room for truly viable business models, especially for projects and founders that seek community returns over capital ones.\n\n### The Experiment\n\nThe fund will explore the creation of a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) as a possible antidote to traditional funding models. By adopting principles of cooperativism and distributed governance, and pairing these with the transparency of this crypto-native approach, this experiment will stress test a series of evolving funding theses, in order to develop a funding model that employs a mix of funding instruments for capital disbursement to creative projects.\n\nIn order to cultivate a community-centric approach to funding, we have envisioned the experiment in four phases. These phases are intentionally slow, taking a soft approach to funding that is rooted in a sense of community and sustainability.\n\n* **SEED PHASE (RESEARCH)** - Community-source our initial thesis through a series of interviews, and public explorations over a period of 6 months.\n* **BUD PHASE (MVP)** - A 6 month MVP launching an initial round of funding under the established primary thesis as developed through the research phase. This MVP will focus on creative projects within the NEW INC ecosystem.\n* **FLOWER PHASE (EXPERIMENT)** - An ongoing two year thought experiment within the NEW INC ecosystem consisting of consecutive experimental rounds of funding, each linked to a thesis that builds upon findings from past rounds.\n* **GARDEN PHASE (LAUNCH)** - Pending successful experimentation and development of a viable model for the fund within the NEW INC Ecosystem, the fund will launch publicly as a community-led, cooperatively controlled fund that equitably distributes capital within the larger creative ecosystem.\n\n### Our Thesis\n\nA community-first approach to the distribution of capital is an essential step towards diversifying the landscape of creatives and projects who have access to capital. Our current thesis is at the time of this writing is:\n\n**Thesis 1.0**\n\n*The development of a community-led, cooperatively controlled fund will create a model for funding and sustaining creative ecosystem projects across multiple impact outcomes - ranging from financial return to community return.*\n\nThis thesis is centered around four main tenets:\n\n* **Community:** A fund can be community led and cooperatively controlled.\n* **Sustainability:** A fund can sustain a creative ecosystem across multiple impact outcomes (financial and social).\n* **Equity:** A fund can amplify and sustain projects in the creative ecosystem that are underserved by traditional means of funding.\n* **Decentralized:** A fund can employ decentralized governance principles and economics facilitated by web 3.0 technology, specifically via a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).\n\n### Current Members\n\nThe fund came about through a series of organic conversations among interested NEW INC community members. Currently the fund is being managed and organized by Alex Darby, Austin Robey, Bhavik Singh, Jonah King, and Noya Kohavi. Over the past few months, we have each brought a unique perspective on the value that creation of an experimental fund could build within the creative ecosystem, and we invite the community to learn more about our members and our relationship to this funding experiment.\n\n\n---\n\n***[Alex Darby](https://www.alexandradarby.com/) is a creative producer, artist, and cultural strategist. She is the Founder of [Darby Studios](https://darbystudios.xyz/) and works with artists, entrepreneurs, and cultural institutions to develop businesses, projects, content, and experiences.***\n\nAfter many years working with and for cultural orgs and artists to produce creative work, I joined the NEW INC team during its first cohort year. After 5 years of being embedded in its creative community, I observed and supported hundreds of creatives and businesses struggling with the same issues around funding — there is no clear, viable business model for creative practice as it looks today.\n\nA new model for funding creative practice is essential if we as a community want to see it survive. Institutional funding structures lack sustainability, resulting in misused resources, unclear scope, and a lack of ongoing support. We need a more community-centric approach to opportunity creation that fosters reciprocity and shared ownership over projects and pipelines. We need to fund black and women led projects. We need to mobilize communities. We need shared goals, intentional organizations, and transparency.\n\nI have a big imagination for the future that is possible for the creative community through this work. Re-thinking funding access means safeguarding creative practice as a viable model for future communities. My hope is that this experiment can build tangible opportunities for sustainable business models in the creative entrepreneurial space, and beyond that create a repeatable model for new organizations, structures, and communities to iterate on and learn from. By re-imagining funding for creative practice we can begin to redistribute wealth and power into the hands of creators and community, ensuring creative practice is available to all, not just a privileged few.\n\n\n---\n\n***Austin Robey is Head of Growth at [Unlock Protocol](https://unlock-protocol.com/), and a Co-Founder of [Ampled](https://www.ampled.com/), a cooperatively-owned web platform that allows musicians to be directly supported by their community.***\n\nI became involved with the NEW INC community in its 6th year as part of the “Equitable Platforms” track. I had helped co-found a cooperative web platform called Ampled, which became a project incubated within NEW INC.\n\nWorking to build a co-op made me realize how many gaps there were in both the for-profit and non-profit funding ecosystems. I’ve become interested in the Web 3.0 space as a way to achieve greater collective ownership of platforms and networks, at scale.\n\nI’d love to imagine a future where public or shared goods can find adequate funding while still maintaining community ownership and control. I’d like to envision a future where resources are shifted beyond capital serving capital, towards capital used to serve collective needs.\n\n\n---\n\n***[Bhavik Singh](https://bhaviksingh.com/) is an artist and technologist who creates software that is intimate, slow, & community powered.***\n\nAfter spending many years working in consumer technology, I came to NEW INC in its 7th year to explore new futures for social software. Working collaboratively with other artists, activists, and technologists, I've been spending time building software that feels intimate, slow and meaningfully powered by its community.\n\nI've realized that both artists and technologists feel limited by their funding structures. Technologists feel incentivized to build a very specific type of hyper-growth software and top-down software company. Artists feel limited by institutional mandates, and often reluctantly create scarce work that aligns with the market value rather their own.\n\nThrough this experiment, I'm excited to explore models for communities to sustain themselves not only creatively and intellectually, but also economically. I'm curious how the web3 can empower this, but also look to a long history of cooperative movements for inspiration. Eventually, I hope it means more time for all of us, in the grass, amongst the trees.\n\n\n---\n\n***[Jonah King](https://jonahkingartist.cargo.site/) is a media artist, filmmaker and educator examining how ecological systems give rise to culture and identity through films, texts, sculptures, installations and extended realities.***\n\nI came to NEW INC in Y7&8 via the commercial art world, seeking fresh approaches to art, technology and community. I work across disciplines and have a background in establishing cultural platforms for inclusive, collaborative community authorship.\n\nI am interested in projects that exercise novel approaches to decentralised processes and offer access and support in spaces overlooked by established funding infrastructure. The emerging web 3.0 provides a crucial opportunity to push the boundaries of how and who gets support when creating culture.\n\nI envision an opportunity to establish a sustainable model for funding projects and initiatives based on values not limited to profit return but instead by the breadth of scope, experimentation and social impact. I hope this nourishes neglected creators taking risks in their work.\n\n\n---\n\n***[Noya Kohavi](https://www.noyakohavi.com/) is a technologist, writer and independent consultant. Her work utilizes computer vision and computational linguistics to generate new narratives and insights, focusing on data ethics and a queer approach to computing.***\n\nI came to NEW INC in 2019 after working in startup/corporate tech to focus on ethical implementation of search and exploration algorithms and queer computation. In my two years there, I built a AI visual discovery engine for museum collections called LINEAGE.\n\nI’m interested in the ways in which form informs content, in the sense that funding structures inform which ideas are developed and which remain ‘just ideas’, even before they reach a fundraising stage. The transparency in the root of this project, both theoretical and practical, will serve as an object lesson regardless of outcome. Also, the possibility of material sustainability for our community and those aligned and adjacent.\n\nI believe the success and the failures we can generate through an experimental model, and the lessons we share, can inform not just our fund but the ecosystem at large.\n\n## Imagine New Futures With Us\n\nWe invite the wider creative community to join us in imagining new futures for funding creative projects.\n\n* You can follow along with our research via [Mirror](https://unnamedfund.mirror.xyz/), our [mailing list](https://unnamed.fund/interest.html), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Unnamedfund) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/unnamedfund/).\n* If you’re interested in actively contributing to our research through an interview, or you’d like to become a thought partner, please join our [mailing list](https://unnamed.fund/interest.html).\n* During the research phase the fund is not open to applications for funders or organizing members, but we are taking expressions of interest from the community.

{"id": "aGFbCN5WT4gWyqGf97nHAK29GVEcw0mIiinH7E6rLbg", "title": "Introducing Anoma: A Blockchain for Private Asset-Agnostic Bartering", "body": "## What is Anoma?\n\nAnoma is a sovereign, proof-of-stake blockchain that enables private, asset-agnostic bartering among *any number of parties*. To illustrate the capabilities of Anoma, we’ll go through three examples and provide an overview of some of the key components of the protocol.\n\n## Private transfers with one asset type\n\nIn the first example, there are two participants: Alice, residing in San Francisco, and Bob, residing in Zürich. Alice and Bob had dinner together abroad, before they returned to their respective countries. To settle the bill for dinner, Alice wants to pay Bob in BTC.\n\nIn this example, two parties wish to transact, where the sender’s asset type (BTC) coincides with the receiver’s asset type. The Anoma blockchain is able to settle this transaction in zero-knowledge privacy. On Anoma, observers will not be able to infer any information about this transaction between Alice and Bob. Additionally, this transaction will look indistinguishable from any other transaction involving BTC, ETH, or any other cryptocurrencies.\n\n## Private transfers with two asset types\n\nIn the second example, Alice is on a business trip in Shanghai and visits 1984 Bookstore & Café, a trendy coffee shop in the bustling megacity. Alice, who holds primarily BTC in her mobile wallet, wants to pay for coffee.\n\nJust like the first example, this transaction involves two parties: Alice and the coffee shop. However, the sender’s asset type (BTC) does not coincide with the recipient’s asset type, as the coffee shop only accepts CNY or CNYC, a stablecoin form of 人民币. Through Anoma, Alice can spend BTC and the coffee shop can receive CNYC.\n\nUnder the hood, the Anoma blockchain automatically facilitates exchange between BTC and CNYC at the best market rate at the time, and all intermediate transactions (sending BTC, the BTC/CNYC exchange, and receiving CNYC) benefit from privacy provided by a multi-denomination zero-knowledge transfer circuit, which enables different types of assets to share one anonymity set. This way, the privacy guarantees will not be limited by the transaction volume of each individual asset.\n\nThis transaction is enabled by Anoma’s custom-tailored state machine, which has an built-in trade system supporting cross-chain asset transfers and settlement, a novel account system based on *validity predicates*, and an *intent matching system* with liquidity incentivization.\n\n## N-party bartering\n\nIn the third example there are three parties: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice holds BTC and wants DOT, Bob holds ETH and wants BTC, and Charlie holds DOT and wants ETH.\n\nIn this case, there are three parties, and no two can directly trade with each other because their desires are pairwise mismatched. The Anoma intent matching system and blockchain are able to match and settle the wants of all three participants at the same time. In other words, Anoma enables *bartering *among all three parties, as Alice, Bob, and Charlie do not need to agree on a common means of exchange in order to satisfy their individual wants.\n\nUsing the components described above, combined with custom zero-knowledge circuits, all interactions involved in an *𝐍*-party barter can benefit from the same privacy guarantees as a simple two-party asset transfer. Moreover, users of Anoma can barter any types of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fungible-assets, non-fungible assets or any upcoming types that represent more complex valuables.\n\nLastly, the Anoma blockchain is equipped with a distributed key generation and threshold decryption scheme to prevent reordering transactions and front-running trades.\n\n## The motivations behind Anoma\n\nThe motivations behind Anoma are threefold: the loss of individual financial privacy, the loss of local financial sovereignty, and the inability of humankind to coordinate at scale.\n\nFirst, the loss of financial privacy is fueled by the non-consensual usage of sensitive data about each individual’s financial activity by third parties. In mild cases, this results in intrusive commercial practices, such as targeted advertising or monetization of sensitive information. In more severe cases, this contributes to national and foreign governmental and corporate surveillance programs.\n\nSecond, the loss of local financial sovereignty results from the dependence on traditional financial systems — from electronic forms of fiat currencies to the permissioned backbone of international wire transfers. These systems, which often consist of a complex web of direct and indirect intermediaries, are susceptible to capture by governments, who can leverage them to enforce their sanctions on domestic or foreign residents.\n\nThird, humankind lacks the tools to solve problems of a cross-border nature which require the coordination of large groups of distinct economic agents. An existentially threatening subset of them, *collective action problems*, are currently only addressable through mechanisms that rely on the intervention of governments. Unfortunately, said problems often transcend national borders, thereby rendering the enforcement capabilities of Westphalian nation states inadequate.\n\n## The vision behind Anoma\n\nThe Anoma blockchain protocol aims to facilitate “*Self-Sovereign Communities”* by providing tools that grant increased control to individuals and communities’ of the systems governing their day-to-day aspects and activities, such as financial privacy, sovereignty, and coordination.\n\nAs the first instances of the Anoma protocol focus on granting privacy-preserving financial tools, the Anoma blockchain protocol places special emphasis on supporting any kind of asset and on zero-knowledge privacy regardless of the denomination of the assets.\n\nThe purpose of *undefining money *refers to the removal of any artificial constraints around what can be used as money or *means of exchange*, providing higher flexibility and control to the users of the protocol in deciding what to use — be it assets created by others or assets they created themselves. Anoma’s focus on financial self-sovereignty is also illustrated by the ***N***-party barter system, which facilitates asset-agnostic private cash in the simplest cases, but can assist in exchange, trades, and other financial activities of entire communities.\n\nFinally, in alignment with the vision, the design of the Anoma blockchain protocol scales via *fractal scaling*. Simply put, each Anoma blockchain instance is designed to integrate seamlessly with other instances, which can be specialized geographically (e.g. when Alice pays for coffee in Shanghai, this transaction is settled by the Chinese instance of Anoma) or are tailored to satisfy the needs and purposes of any real-world or virtual community (e.g. an Anoma instance that allows Animal Crossing players to trade furniture).\n\n## The team building Anoma\n\nThe [Anoma blockchain](https://anoma.network/) protocol is being built by [Heliax](https://heliax.dev/), a team currently composed of 23 cross-disciplinary members and supported by the [Anoma Foundation](http://anoma.foundation/).\n", "timestamp": 1635972239, "digest": "OLmqi2yNhKsgPp1hF_a0MRIxmSgsdcc56H-Fc1Z21Uo", "contributor": "0x71fAB14a22E324699161E6e976F97b6685F65010"}
{"id": "AICsIg4KhdX5o1FaezS1WSWWpbhfS6As__nBYlWxytE", "title": "Anoma is Open-source - Anoma Network - Medium", "body": "[![Awa Sun Yin](https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/2\\*lixhEKqbx-1LsCnR_PYaSw.jpeg)](https://medium.com/@awasunyin?source=post_page-----9c1c8721bb7a--------------------------------)\n\n**TL;DR**: Check the [Anoma repository](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma) or [documentation](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/) out.\n\nShortly after Anoma’s [announcement](https://medium.com/anomanetwork/introducing-anoma-a-blockchain-for-private-asset-agnostic-bartering-dcc47ac42d9f) at the end of March, the core developers of Anoma released the [whitepaper](https://anoma.network/papers/whitepaper.pdf), which provides a comprehensive overview of the design and features of the protocol. Following the ethos of the project and its core developers, the current implementation of the protocol has been open-sourced — paving the way for a more accessible research and developer journey of Anoma.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PnediXxrICx7HafyHdFyyA.png)\n\n## In the Anoma codebase\n\nFrom the beginning of the year, the core developers of Anoma have been working continuously on the Anoma ledger, its intent gossip system, and the matchmaker system. The ledger is characterized by its integration with Tendermint BFT consensus and WASM, in addition to basic capabilities such as key-value store, transactions, and a command-line interface. Over the last moon cycle, the support for [validity predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/) on WASM, gas metering, and storage improvements among other changes were added to the ledger; the [intent gossip system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is able to broadcast and support simple token barter intents; and the [matchmaker](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is integrated with a WASM matching algorithm, allowing the system to match simple token barter intents. For a more in-depth view of the architecture of Anoma, take a look at the [documentation](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/).\n\n## Learning by playing with Anoma\n\nAs the design of the Anoma protocol is distinct in several ways, some features might appear unfamiliar, especially if you’re accustomed to protocols designed to be cryptocurrencies or platforms for arbitrary computation. Besides learning about Anoma via the growing base of resources, a swifter way for the playful minds would be by trying Anoma out.\n\nIf you’re interested in setting up your own local testnet of Anoma, you can find the guidelines for installing, building, operating an Anoma node [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#installing). You can also find the Rust docs for the Anoma crates [here](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/rustdoc/anoma/). Some of the most notable interactions involve validity predicates, creating and submitting *intents*, and operating the intent gossip and matchmaker systems.\n\n## Contributing to Anoma\n\nNothing would delight the core developers of Anoma more than feedback on the design, code, or documentation from the community at any scale — from typos to reviews on the design. Find the contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#how-to-contribute) and a list of open issues [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma/issues).\n\nIf you feel aligned with the vision of Anoma and would be interested in getting more involved with the project, know that the current team is growing and looking for more team members driven by the purpose of making privacy-preserving and self-sovereignty tools accessible. Take a look at this [list of open positions](https://heliax.dev/jobs), including but not limited to distributed systems research, zero-knowledge cryptography research and protocol engineering in Rust.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nAn upcoming development of the Anoma protocol is in the works and it combines the above with proof-of-stake and a dynamic validator selection mechanism. Later, support for [Ferveo](https://anoma.network/blog/ferveo-a-distributed-key-generation-scheme-for-front-running-protection) for front-running protection will be integrated, with other notable features to follow.

Today, we’re thrilled to announce Anoma’s first public testnet: Feigenbaum.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*ygP0CgVBnYjRuQNc)\n\nAnnouncing Feigenbaum: Anoma’s first public testnet\n\n## What is Feigenbaum?\n\nFeigenbaum is Anoma’s first public test network, developed and currently maintained by the team building Anoma. It is the first milestone in Anoma’s public testnet roadmap, which has been constructed to enable a progressive deployment of components and features, and to facilitate the participation of early users in testing and interacting with the implementation– thereby parallelizing the development of further features, and the gathering and integration of external user feedback.\n\n*Fractals* are a recurring theme in the design of Anoma, noticeable, for instance, in how the protocol upgrade mechanism works or in how Anoma’s ecosystem scales via the co-existence of many instances. Thus, Anoma’s protocol version names take inspiration from fractals, beginning with the Feigenbaum testnet, named after the [Feigenbaum attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map), a deterministic fractal with a very low [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension) dimension.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Upgrades](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-upgrades/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Scaling](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-scaling/)\n\n## What features does Feigenbaum support?\n\nThe current version of the protocol provides an early demonstration of the intent gossip and matchmaker components in the peer-to-peer layer, which are very particular to the design of the Anoma protocol and unprecedented in the architecture of other Layer 1 blockchains. It also offers a playground for customizing and deploying validity predicates and transactions in Rust. Anoma implements proof-of-stake (PoS) as its sibyl resistance mechanism and Tendermint, a variant of the practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism (PBFT). Finally, interactions with the protocol are facilitated via the command-line interface (CLI) client, node, and wallet.\n\n## What can you do on Feigenbaum?\n\nIn addition to the basic interactions with the ledger, Feigenbaum already enables experimentation for users who might be interested in operating and directly participating in the network at mainnet launch.\n\nThe roles\\* supported are operating validator nodes, intent gossip, and matchmaking nodes. For builders that enjoy playing with Rust, we encourage them to try [customizing validity predicates](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/ledger/customize.html), transactions, or even [the matchmaker node](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/intent-gossip-and-matchmaker.html). For early end-users that are not intimidated by the command-line, it’s not too early to start with the basics, such as [setting up a wallet](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/wallet.html) with addresses, getting some testnet tokens from the faucet account, making transfers, and staking– or, for the most adventurous ones, a primer to Anoma as a [multivariate, multivariable protocol](https://twitter.com/awasunyin/status/1422508932635967489?s=20), you can start crafting custom intents and deploying them directly to the intents gossip network.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Intent Gossip & Matchmaking system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Validity Predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/)\n\n\\*[Stay tuned](https://twitter.com/anomanetwork) for a new series of articles on our blog that explain each role in the Anoma Network!\n\n## How do I participate in the Feigenbaum testnet?\n\nAs a public, permissionless testnet, anyone can join anonymously by pulling the code from the [repository](https://github.com/anoma/anoma/releases/tag/v0.2.0) and following the instructions in the [docs](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/).\n\nA few members from the team building Anoma will also be participating in the Feigenbaum testnet to ensure that it runs smoothly. Furthermore, some will be available on Anoma’s [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/RzN98vXbFt) (#feigenbaum channel) to help out with installation or any other issues, as well as for gathering user feedback.\n\nFinally, to stay up-to-date on all news and communications related to Anoma’s Feigenbaum and future testnets, we recommend that you fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/GLzTF37vwokbFYeW9) to receive the testnet newsletter.\n", "timestamp": 1635972285, "digest": "gAjgTJhKSf0PuzvRaP5ohCw1E2_0zp0YnNh0mwVxh3E", "contributor": "0x2ff74049304739bf5020D14258f24A47b54C407B"}

That is a big improvement to the instrumentalization of minoritarian ones. And, in the Internet, minoritarian means almost “not English”.

{"id": "E9uphtU_k4e3d561rz2d-rsw0C_thr7D1iTv5v1sTU4", "title": "Re-imagining Creative Ecosystem Funding", "body": "Welcome to [Unnamed Fund](https://unnamed.fund/) —  a cooperatively controlled creative ecosystem fund.\n\nWe're a group of creatives working towards sustainable funding solutions for artists, creative practice, and creative enterprises. As members and alumni of [NEW INC](https://newinc.org/), the New Museum’s incubator, we came together with the goal of building community focused solutions to, and imagining new futures for funding within our ecosystem.\n\n\n---\n\n### What would it look like to develop an experimental, community-led, cooperatively controlled fund for the creative ecosystem?\n\nUnnamed Fund is a cooperatively controlled creative ecosystem fund. Part new funding model and part provocation, this experimental fund seeks to re-imagine existing models for funding creative, artistic, and entrepreneurial projects by sustaining those underserved by traditional funding through the equitable distribution of capital, across multiple impact outcomes.\n\nResponding to the deficit of available funding resources for creators, in particular those underserved by traditional models, a core group of members have organically come together to shape this experiment. United around the principles of distributed governance, and an excitement for community-led solutions, we began to develop ideas for a cooperatively governed fund through slow, organic, and intentional work.\n\nThe fund is currently in a phase of public research - through which we will publish our unfinished thesis, refined through research and conversations with community members. We expect this research phase to continue for the rest of 2021, with a view to launching an initial round of funding in Spring of 2022. This initial round will launch as a public/private beta, working directly with NEW INC and its community of creatives as a test case for the viability of the fund.\n\n### The Problem With Funding\n\nThe distribution of capital within the creative and entrepreneurial ecosystem is problematic at best. At worst, it actively and deliberately excludes diverse creators and founders from access to capital, creating a cultural and economic echo chamber under a singular narrative. This is particularly concerning as it narrows the focus of what it means to be successful, with a predisposition towards unsustainable growth, and products over people.\n\nWhen we look to other nations, there are a multiplicity of support options for creative endeavors that are not linked to private wealth. But here in the US, there is a serious dearth of unrestricted funding options, leaving the survival of the creative community/economy at the mercy of venture capitalists, foundations, institutions, crowdfunding, and philanthropy.\n\nTraditional funding models such as investment are plagued with issues of inaccessibility, discrimination, and top-down decision making (to name a few), but a more elegant, equitable, and sustainable alternative has yet to emerge with any semblance of viability. While these models present compelling opportunities for funding projects in the creative ecosystem, systemic inequality, intermittent availability, and a virtually non-existent framework for financial sustainability leave little room for truly viable business models, especially for projects and founders that seek community returns over capital ones.\n\n### The Experiment\n\nThe fund will explore the creation of a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) as a possible antidote to traditional funding models. By adopting principles of cooperativism and distributed governance, and pairing these with the transparency of this crypto-native approach, this experiment will stress test a series of evolving funding theses, in order to develop a funding model that employs a mix of funding instruments for capital disbursement to creative projects.\n\nIn order to cultivate a community-centric approach to funding, we have envisioned the experiment in four phases. These phases are intentionally slow, taking a soft approach to funding that is rooted in a sense of community and sustainability.\n\n* **SEED PHASE (RESEARCH)** - Community-source our initial thesis through a series of interviews, and public explorations over a period of 6 months.\n* **BUD PHASE (MVP)** - A 6 month MVP launching an initial round of funding under the established primary thesis as developed through the research phase. This MVP will focus on creative projects within the NEW INC ecosystem.\n* **FLOWER PHASE (EXPERIMENT)** - An ongoing two year thought experiment within the NEW INC ecosystem consisting of consecutive experimental rounds of funding, each linked to a thesis that builds upon findings from past rounds.\n* **GARDEN PHASE (LAUNCH)** - Pending successful experimentation and development of a viable model for the fund within the NEW INC Ecosystem, the fund will launch publicly as a community-led, cooperatively controlled fund that equitably distributes capital within the larger creative ecosystem.\n\n### Our Thesis\n\nA community-first approach to the distribution of capital is an essential step towards diversifying the landscape of creatives and projects who have access to capital. Our current thesis is at the time of this writing is:\n\n**Thesis 1.0**\n\n*The development of a community-led, cooperatively controlled fund will create a model for funding and sustaining creative ecosystem projects across multiple impact outcomes - ranging from financial return to community return.*\n\nThis thesis is centered around four main tenets:\n\n* **Community:** A fund can be community led and cooperatively controlled.\n* **Sustainability:** A fund can sustain a creative ecosystem across multiple impact outcomes (financial and social).\n* **Equity:** A fund can amplify and sustain projects in the creative ecosystem that are underserved by traditional means of funding.\n* **Decentralized:** A fund can employ decentralized governance principles and economics facilitated by web 3.0 technology, specifically via a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).\n\n### Current Members\n\nThe fund came about through a series of organic conversations among interested NEW INC community members. Currently the fund is being managed and organized by Alex Darby, Austin Robey, Bhavik Singh, Jonah King, and Noya Kohavi. Over the past few months, we have each brought a unique perspective on the value that creation of an experimental fund could build within the creative ecosystem, and we invite the community to learn more about our members and our relationship to this funding experiment.\n\n\n---\n\n***[Alex Darby](https://www.alexandradarby.com/) is a creative producer, artist, and cultural strategist. She is the Founder of [Darby Studios](https://darbystudios.xyz/) and works with artists, entrepreneurs, and cultural institutions to develop businesses, projects, content, and experiences.***\n\nAfter many years working with and for cultural orgs and artists to produce creative work, I joined the NEW INC team during its first cohort year. After 5 years of being embedded in its creative community, I observed and supported hundreds of creatives and businesses struggling with the same issues around funding — there is no clear, viable business model for creative practice as it looks today.\n\nA new model for funding creative practice is essential if we as a community want to see it survive. Institutional funding structures lack sustainability, resulting in misused resources, unclear scope, and a lack of ongoing support. We need a more community-centric approach to opportunity creation that fosters reciprocity and shared ownership over projects and pipelines. We need to fund black and women led projects. We need to mobilize communities. We need shared goals, intentional organizations, and transparency.\n\nI have a big imagination for the future that is possible for the creative community through this work. Re-thinking funding access means safeguarding creative practice as a viable model for future communities. My hope is that this experiment can build tangible opportunities for sustainable business models in the creative entrepreneurial space, and beyond that create a repeatable model for new organizations, structures, and communities to iterate on and learn from. By re-imagining funding for creative practice we can begin to redistribute wealth and power into the hands of creators and community, ensuring creative practice is available to all, not just a privileged few.\n\n\n---\n\n***Austin Robey is Head of Growth at [Unlock Protocol](https://unlock-protocol.com/), and a Co-Founder of [Ampled](https://www.ampled.com/), a cooperatively-owned web platform that allows musicians to be directly supported by their community.***\n\nI became involved with the NEW INC community in its 6th year as part of the “Equitable Platforms” track. I had helped co-found a cooperative web platform called Ampled, which became a project incubated within NEW INC.\n\nWorking to build a co-op made me realize how many gaps there were in both the for-profit and non-profit funding ecosystems. I’ve become interested in the Web 3.0 space as a way to achieve greater collective ownership of platforms and networks, at scale.\n\nI’d love to imagine a future where public or shared goods can find adequate funding while still maintaining community ownership and control. I’d like to envision a future where resources are shifted beyond capital serving capital, towards capital used to serve collective needs.\n\n\n---\n\n***[Bhavik Singh](https://bhaviksingh.com/) is an artist and technologist who creates software that is intimate, slow, & community powered.***\n\nAfter spending many years working in consumer technology, I came to NEW INC in its 7th year to explore new futures for social software. Working collaboratively with other artists, activists, and technologists, I've been spending time building software that feels intimate, slow and meaningfully powered by its community.\n\nI've realized that both artists and technologists feel limited by their funding structures. Technologists feel incentivized to build a very specific type of hyper-growth software and top-down software company. Artists feel limited by institutional mandates, and often reluctantly create scarce work that aligns with the market value rather their own.\n\nThrough this experiment, I'm excited to explore models for communities to sustain themselves not only creatively and intellectually, but also economically. I'm curious how the web3 can empower this, but also look to a long history of cooperative movements for inspiration. Eventually, I hope it means more time for all of us, in the grass, amongst the trees.\n\n\n---\n\n***[Jonah King](https://jonahkingartist.cargo.site/) is a media artist, filmmaker and educator examining how ecological systems give rise to culture and identity through films, texts, sculptures, installations and extended realities.***\n\nI came to NEW INC in Y7&8 via the commercial art world, seeking fresh approaches to art, technology and community. I work across disciplines and have a background in establishing cultural platforms for inclusive, collaborative community authorship.\n\nI am interested in projects that exercise novel approaches to decentralised processes and offer access and support in spaces overlooked by established funding infrastructure. The emerging web 3.0 provides a crucial opportunity to push the boundaries of how and who gets support when creating culture.\n\nI envision an opportunity to establish a sustainable model for funding projects and initiatives based on values not limited to profit return but instead by the breadth of scope, experimentation and social impact. I hope this nourishes neglected creators taking risks in their work.\n\n\n---\n\n***[Noya Kohavi](https://www.noyakohavi.com/) is a technologist, writer and independent consultant. Her work utilizes computer vision and computational linguistics to generate new narratives and insights, focusing on data ethics and a queer approach to computing.***\n\nI came to NEW INC in 2019 after working in startup/corporate tech to focus on ethical implementation of search and exploration algorithms and queer computation. In my two years there, I built a AI visual discovery engine for museum collections called LINEAGE.\n\nI’m interested in the ways in which form informs content, in the sense that funding structures inform which ideas are developed and which remain ‘just ideas’, even before they reach a fundraising stage. The transparency in the root of this project, both theoretical and practical, will serve as an object lesson regardless of outcome. Also, the possibility of material sustainability for our community and those aligned and adjacent.\n\nI believe the success and the failures we can generate through an experimental model, and the lessons we share, can inform not just our fund but the ecosystem at large.\n\n## Imagine New Futures With Us\n\nWe invite the wider creative community to join us in imagining new futures for funding creative projects.\n\n* You can follow along with our research via [Mirror](https://unnamedfund.mirror.xyz/), our [mailing list](https://unnamed.fund/interest.html), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Unnamedfund) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/unnamedfund/).\n* If you’re interested in actively contributing to our research through an interview, or you’d like to become a thought partner, please join our [mailing list](https://unnamed.fund/interest.html).\n* During the research phase the fund is not open to applications for funders or organizing members, but we are taking expressions of interest from the community.

Security is one of the most formidable challenges for smart contract implementation in present times. There exist concerns of inefficiencies, security breaches and some broken codes that could lead to high or unnecessary costs for any user of a protocol.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges with smart contract implementation is the fact that they have an irreversible nature and users can lose a part or whole of their funds deposited in a contract that has not been written effectively.\n\nSmart contract auditing is therefore important for the better optimization of codes and improves the performance of the smart contract, in a way that also benefits the user of that contract (for example — gas efficiency conditions), enhanced vaults or wallets on the protocols, security against hacks and more.\n\n## **Tempus Passes Security Audit of Coinspect**\n\nWe are happy to announce the completion of our first audit by [Coinspect](https://www.coinspect.com/) who were able to find only 3 medium risk bugs that have now all been fixed.\n\nAs explained by Coinspect, no high-risk vulnerabilities that would result in user funds being stolen were identified from the source code. One of the medium-risk issues detected could have a high impact but there was a low likelihood of that event taking place. This bug has now also been fixed. Other bugs are related to the power of the pool owners and whether they could update the fees without constraints and that could have an adverse impact on users in case the accounts were compromised.\n\nFind Coinspect’s audit report [here](https://www.coinspect.com/doc/Coinspect%20-%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20-%20Tempus%20v211013.pdf).\n\n## **Tempus Security Audit Competition at Code 423n4**\n\nTempus is a future yield tokenization and fixed-rate protocol that allows users to optimize their existing exposure to variable yield based on their risk tolerance. As we continue to build on other protocols it is important for us to make sure our contracts are secured in case there is a failure on the protocols that we are building on.\n\nEnterprise audits do not necessarily guarantee the quality and robustness of smart contracts. Instead of organising a bug bounty program ourselves, we decided to partner with [Code 423n4](https://code423n4.com/) that creates incentivised weekly smart contract audit competitions that allow some of the most talented security researchers to do a thorough security audit of the smart contracts. It uses a novel competitive mechanism that allows anyone to help secure protocols and platforms without having to be a full-time professional auditor. This approach is designed to increase the depth and breadth of an audit while incentivizing security researchers to find the highest-risk and rarest bugs.\n\nIn addition to that, it does not follow the approach of ‘first person to turn in the bug gets the bounty’. Instead, they reward everyone’s contributions even if there are multiple submissions of the same bug.\n\nThe smart contract audit competition for Tempus began** on** **October 14, 2021, at 00:00 UTC**.\n\nThis contest ends **on October 20, 2021, at 23:59 UTC**.\n\n**We have allocated $50,000 USDC for anyone who is able to find bugs or can help us improve gas optimization on Tempus.**\n\n**Read more about the contest **[**here**](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus)** and start now!**\n\n## **About Tempus**\n\nTempus is a protocol where users can re-allocate the risk of interest rate fluctuations between each other. Users can deposit their yield-bearing tokens (such as stETH) which Tempus splits into tokenized principal and yield tokens. Those primitives can then be traded against each other through the custom Balancer v2 AMM. Tempus will offer capital-efficient fixed rate yields and high variable yields on various assets. For example, Tempus will be the first team to release fixed-rate ETH 2.0 staking through Lido. Tempus will also integrate Compound, Aave and Yearn.\n\n[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6gauHECShr) | [Github](https://github.com/tempus-finance) | [Medium](https://medium.com/@tempusfinance) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tempusfinance) | [Website](https://tempus.finance/)\n", "timestamp": 1635972466, "digest": "y_noPHtGY7zKANtWVt0kQT87ESxNOlsnW5pNpvQFfkI", "contributor": "0x979AbfF1D6b676CeAC21AEeD3d800d48e6775be2"}

Following the ethos of the project and its core developers, the current implementation of the protocol has been open-sourced — paving the way for a more accessible research and developer journey of Anoma.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PnediXxrICx7HafyHdFyyA.png)\n\n## In the Anoma codebase\n\nFrom the beginning of the year, the core developers of Anoma have been working continuously on the Anoma ledger, its intent gossip system, and the matchmaker system. The ledger is characterized by its integration with Tendermint BFT consensus and WASM, in addition to basic capabilities such as key-value store, transactions, and a command-line interface. Over the last moon cycle, the support for [validity predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/) on WASM, gas metering, and storage improvements among other changes were added to the ledger; the [intent gossip system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is able to broadcast and support simple token barter intents; and the [matchmaker](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is integrated with a WASM matching algorithm, allowing the system to match simple token barter intents. For a more in-depth view of the architecture of Anoma, take a look at the [documentation](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/).\n\n## Learning by playing with Anoma\n\nAs the design of the Anoma protocol is distinct in several ways, some features might appear unfamiliar, especially if you’re accustomed to protocols designed to be cryptocurrencies or platforms for arbitrary computation. Besides learning about Anoma via the growing base of resources, a swifter way for the playful minds would be by trying Anoma out.\n\nIf you’re interested in setting up your own local testnet of Anoma, you can find the guidelines for installing, building, operating an Anoma node [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#installing). You can also find the Rust docs for the Anoma crates [here](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/rustdoc/anoma/). Some of the most notable interactions involve validity predicates, creating and submitting *intents*, and operating the intent gossip and matchmaker systems.\n\n## Contributing to Anoma\n\nNothing would delight the core developers of Anoma more than feedback on the design, code, or documentation from the community at any scale — from typos to reviews on the design. Find the contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#how-to-contribute) and a list of open issues [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma/issues).\n\nIf you feel aligned with the vision of Anoma and would be interested in getting more involved with the project, know that the current team is growing and looking for more team members driven by the purpose of making privacy-preserving and self-sovereignty tools accessible. Take a look at this [list of open positions](https://heliax.dev/jobs), including but not limited to distributed systems research, zero-knowledge cryptography research and protocol engineering in Rust.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nAn upcoming development of the Anoma protocol is in the works and it combines the above with proof-of-stake and a dynamic validator selection mechanism. Later, support for [Ferveo](https://anoma.network/blog/ferveo-a-distributed-key-generation-scheme-for-front-running-protection) for front-running protection will be integrated, with other notable features to follow. The prototype is being refined along with the technical specifications and documentation in preparation for the very first experimental public testnet of Anoma.

Today, we’re thrilled to announce Anoma’s first public testnet: Feigenbaum.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*ygP0CgVBnYjRuQNc)\n\nAnnouncing Feigenbaum: Anoma’s first public testnet\n\n## What is Feigenbaum?\n\nFeigenbaum is Anoma’s first public test network, developed and currently maintained by the team building Anoma. It is the first milestone in Anoma’s public testnet roadmap, which has been constructed to enable a progressive deployment of components and features, and to facilitate the participation of early users in testing and interacting with the implementation– thereby parallelizing the development of further features, and the gathering and integration of external user feedback.\n\n*Fractals* are a recurring theme in the design of Anoma, noticeable, for instance, in how the protocol upgrade mechanism works or in how Anoma’s ecosystem scales via the co-existence of many instances. Thus, Anoma’s protocol version names take inspiration from fractals, beginning with the Feigenbaum testnet, named after the [Feigenbaum attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map), a deterministic fractal with a very low [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension) dimension.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Upgrades](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-upgrades/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Scaling](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-scaling/)\n\n## What features does Feigenbaum support?\n\nThe current version of the protocol provides an early demonstration of the intent gossip and matchmaker components in the peer-to-peer layer, which are very particular to the design of the Anoma protocol and unprecedented in the architecture of other Layer 1 blockchains. It also offers a playground for customizing and deploying validity predicates and transactions in Rust. Anoma implements proof-of-stake (PoS) as its sibyl resistance mechanism and Tendermint, a variant of the practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism (PBFT). Finally, interactions with the protocol are facilitated via the command-line interface (CLI) client, node, and wallet.\n\n## What can you do on Feigenbaum?\n\nIn addition to the basic interactions with the ledger, Feigenbaum already enables experimentation for users who might be interested in operating and directly participating in the network at mainnet launch.\n\nThe roles\\* supported are operating validator nodes, intent gossip, and matchmaking nodes. For builders that enjoy playing with Rust, we encourage them to try [customizing validity predicates](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/ledger/customize.html), transactions, or even [the matchmaker node](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/intent-gossip-and-matchmaker.html). For early end-users that are not intimidated by the command-line, it’s not too early to start with the basics, such as [setting up a wallet](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/wallet.html) with addresses, getting some testnet tokens from the faucet account, making transfers, and staking– or, for the most adventurous ones, a primer to Anoma as a [multivariate, multivariable protocol](https://twitter.com/awasunyin/status/1422508932635967489?s=20), you can start crafting custom intents and deploying them directly to the intents gossip network.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Intent Gossip & Matchmaking system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Validity Predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/)\n\n\\*[Stay tuned](https://twitter.com/anomanetwork) for a new series of articles on our blog that explain each role in the Anoma Network!\n\n## How do I participate in the Feigenbaum testnet?\n\nAs a public, permissionless testnet, anyone can join anonymously by pulling the code from the [repository](https://github.com/anoma/anoma/releases/tag/v0.2.0) and following the instructions in the [docs](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/).\n\nA few members from the team building Anoma will also be participating in the Feigenbaum testnet to ensure that it runs smoothly.

Following the ethos of the project and its core developers, the current implementation of the protocol has been open-sourced — paving the way for a more accessible research and developer journey of Anoma.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PnediXxrICx7HafyHdFyyA.png)\n\n## In the Anoma codebase\n\nFrom the beginning of the year, the core developers of Anoma have been working continuously on the Anoma ledger, its intent gossip system, and the matchmaker system. The ledger is characterized by its integration with Tendermint BFT consensus and WASM, in addition to basic capabilities such as key-value store, transactions, and a command-line interface. Over the last moon cycle, the support for [validity predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/) on WASM, gas metering, and storage improvements among other changes were added to the ledger; the [intent gossip system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is able to broadcast and support simple token barter intents; and the [matchmaker](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is integrated with a WASM matching algorithm, allowing the system to match simple token barter intents. For a more in-depth view of the architecture of Anoma, take a look at the [documentation](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/).\n\n## Learning by playing with Anoma\n\nAs the design of the Anoma protocol is distinct in several ways, some features might appear unfamiliar, especially if you’re accustomed to protocols designed to be cryptocurrencies or platforms for arbitrary computation. Besides learning about Anoma via the growing base of resources, a swifter way for the playful minds would be by trying Anoma out.\n\nIf you’re interested in setting up your own local testnet of Anoma, you can find the guidelines for installing, building, operating an Anoma node [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#installing). You can also find the Rust docs for the Anoma crates [here](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/rustdoc/anoma/). Some of the most notable interactions involve validity predicates, creating and submitting *intents*, and operating the intent gossip and matchmaker systems.\n\n## Contributing to Anoma\n\nNothing would delight the core developers of Anoma more than feedback on the design, code, or documentation from the community at any scale — from typos to reviews on the design. Find the contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#how-to-contribute) and a list of open issues [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma/issues).\n\nIf you feel aligned with the vision of Anoma and would be interested in getting more involved with the project, know that the current team is growing and looking for more team members driven by the purpose of making privacy-preserving and self-sovereignty tools accessible. Take a look at this [list of open positions](https://heliax.dev/jobs), including but not limited to distributed systems research, zero-knowledge cryptography research and protocol engineering in Rust.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nAn upcoming development of the Anoma protocol is in the works and it combines the above with proof-of-stake and a dynamic validator selection mechanism. Later, support for [Ferveo](https://anoma.network/blog/ferveo-a-distributed-key-generation-scheme-for-front-running-protection) for front-running protection will be integrated, with other notable features to follow. The prototype is being refined along with the technical specifications and documentation in preparation for the very first experimental public testnet of Anoma.

Security is one of the most formidable challenges for smart contract implementation in present times. There exist concerns of inefficiencies, security breaches and some broken codes that could lead to high or unnecessary costs for any user of a protocol.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges with smart contract implementation is the fact that they have an irreversible nature and users can lose a part or whole of their funds deposited in a contract that has not been written effectively.\n\nSmart contract auditing is therefore important for the better optimization of codes and improves the performance of the smart contract, in a way that also benefits the user of that contract (for example — gas efficiency conditions), enhanced vaults or wallets on the protocols, security against hacks and more.\n\n## **Tempus Passes Security Audit of Coinspect**\n\nWe are happy to announce the completion of our first audit by [Coinspect](https://www.coinspect.com/) who were able to find only 3 medium risk bugs that have now all been fixed.\n\nAs explained by Coinspect, no high-risk vulnerabilities that would result in user funds being stolen were identified from the source code. One of the medium-risk issues detected could have a high impact but there was a low likelihood of that event taking place. This bug has now also been fixed. Other bugs are related to the power of the pool owners and whether they could update the fees without constraints and that could have an adverse impact on users in case the accounts were compromised.\n\nFind Coinspect’s audit report [here](https://www.coinspect.com/doc/Coinspect%20-%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20-%20Tempus%20v211013.pdf).\n\n## **Tempus Security Audit Competition at Code 423n4**\n\nTempus is a future yield tokenization and fixed-rate protocol that allows users to optimize their existing exposure to variable yield based on their risk tolerance. As we continue to build on other protocols it is important for us to make sure our contracts are secured in case there is a failure on the protocols that we are building on.\n\nEnterprise audits do not necessarily guarantee the quality and robustness of smart contracts. Instead of organising a bug bounty program ourselves, we decided to partner with [Code 423n4](https://code423n4.com/) that creates incentivised weekly smart contract audit competitions that allow some of the most talented security researchers to do a thorough security audit of the smart contracts. It uses a novel competitive mechanism that allows anyone to help secure protocols and platforms without having to be a full-time professional auditor. This approach is designed to increase the depth and breadth of an audit while incentivizing security researchers to find the highest-risk and rarest bugs.\n\nIn addition to that, it does not follow the approach of ‘first person to turn in the bug gets the bounty’. Instead, they reward everyone’s contributions even if there are multiple submissions of the same bug.\n\nThe smart contract audit competition for Tempus began** on** **October 14, 2021, at 00:00 UTC**.\n\nThis contest ends **on October 20, 2021, at 23:59 UTC**.\n\n**We have allocated $50,000 USDC for anyone who is able to find bugs or can help us improve gas optimization on Tempus.**\n\n**Read more about the contest **[**here**](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus)** and start now!**\n\n## **About Tempus**\n\nTempus is a protocol where users can re-allocate the risk of interest rate fluctuations between each other. Users can deposit their yield-bearing tokens (such as stETH) which Tempus splits into tokenized principal and yield tokens. Those primitives can then be traded against each other through the custom Balancer v2 AMM. Tempus will offer capital-efficient fixed rate yields and high variable yields on various assets. For example, Tempus will be the first team to release fixed-rate ETH 2.0 staking through Lido. Tempus will also integrate Compound, Aave and Yearn.\n\n[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6gauHECShr) | [Github](https://github.com/tempus-finance) | [Medium](https://medium.com/@tempusfinance) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tempusfinance) | [Website](https://tempus.finance/)\n", "timestamp": 1635972311, "digest": "TGPD7H1dsbXHUZQVpZ_GPSA06p3cRQHb4nDdNM4BYwA", "contributor": "0x2ff74049304739bf5020D14258f24A47b54C407B"}

Other bugs are related to the power of the pool owners and whether they could update the fees without constraints and that could have an adverse impact on users in case the accounts were compromised.\n\nFind Coinspect’s audit report [here](https://www.coinspect.com/doc/Coinspect%20-%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20-%20Tempus%20v211013.pdf).\n\n## **Tempus Security Audit Competition at Code 423n4**\n\nTempus is a future yield tokenization and fixed-rate protocol that allows users to optimize their existing exposure to variable yield based on their risk tolerance. As we continue to build on other protocols it is important for us to make sure our contracts are secured in case there is a failure on the protocols that we are building on.\n\nEnterprise audits do not necessarily guarantee the quality and robustness of smart contracts. Instead of organising a bug bounty program ourselves, we decided to partner with [Code 423n4](https://code423n4.com/) that creates incentivised weekly smart contract audit competitions that allow some of the most talented security researchers to do a thorough security audit of the smart contracts. It uses a novel competitive mechanism that allows anyone to help secure protocols and platforms without having to be a full-time professional auditor. This approach is designed to increase the depth and breadth of an audit while incentivizing security researchers to find the highest-risk and rarest bugs.\n\nIn addition to that, it does not follow the approach of ‘first person to turn in the bug gets the bounty’. Instead, they reward everyone’s contributions even if there are multiple submissions of the same bug.\n\nThe smart contract audit competition for Tempus began** on** **October 14, 2021, at 00:00 UTC**.\n\nThis contest ends **on October 20, 2021, at 23:59 UTC**.\n\n**We have allocated $50,000 USDC for anyone who is able to find bugs or can help us improve gas optimization on Tempus.**\n\n**Read more about the contest **[**here**](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus)** and start now!**\n\n## **About Tempus**\n\nTempus is a protocol where users can re-allocate the risk of interest rate fluctuations between each other. Users can deposit their yield-bearing tokens (such as stETH) which Tempus splits into tokenized principal and yield tokens. Those primitives can then be traded against each other through the custom Balancer v2 AMM. Tempus will offer capital-efficient fixed rate yields and high variable yields on various assets. For example, Tempus will be the first team to release fixed-rate ETH 2.0 staking through Lido. Tempus will also integrate Compound, Aave and Yearn.\n\n[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6gauHECShr) | [Github](https://github.com/tempus-finance) | [Medium](https://medium.com/@tempusfinance) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tempusfinance) | [Website](https://tempus.finance/)\n", "timestamp": 1635972378, "digest": "Pnuvza4v1YOiiLSTaudza3Q_Uk01ZqPH8pUSnu_g9ks", "contributor": "0x8CE12f759601C1F93C1c00F2E5b49897b6B468A9"}

Today, we’re thrilled to announce Anoma’s first public testnet: Feigenbaum.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*ygP0CgVBnYjRuQNc)\n\nAnnouncing Feigenbaum: Anoma’s first public testnet\n\n## What is Feigenbaum?\n\nFeigenbaum is Anoma’s first public test network, developed and currently maintained by the team building Anoma. It is the first milestone in Anoma’s public testnet roadmap, which has been constructed to enable a progressive deployment of components and features, and to facilitate the participation of early users in testing and interacting with the implementation– thereby parallelizing the development of further features, and the gathering and integration of external user feedback.\n\n*Fractals* are a recurring theme in the design of Anoma, noticeable, for instance, in how the protocol upgrade mechanism works or in how Anoma’s ecosystem scales via the co-existence of many instances. Thus, Anoma’s protocol version names take inspiration from fractals, beginning with the Feigenbaum testnet, named after the [Feigenbaum attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map), a deterministic fractal with a very low [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension) dimension.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Upgrades](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-upgrades/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Scaling](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-scaling/)\n\n## What features does Feigenbaum support?\n\nThe current version of the protocol provides an early demonstration of the intent gossip and matchmaker components in the peer-to-peer layer, which are very particular to the design of the Anoma protocol and unprecedented in the architecture of other Layer 1 blockchains. It also offers a playground for customizing and deploying validity predicates and transactions in Rust. Anoma implements proof-of-stake (PoS) as its sibyl resistance mechanism and Tendermint, a variant of the practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism (PBFT). Finally, interactions with the protocol are facilitated via the command-line interface (CLI) client, node, and wallet.\n\n## What can you do on Feigenbaum?\n\nIn addition to the basic interactions with the ledger, Feigenbaum already enables experimentation for users who might be interested in operating and directly participating in the network at mainnet launch.\n\nThe roles\\* supported are operating validator nodes, intent gossip, and matchmaking nodes. For builders that enjoy playing with Rust, we encourage them to try [customizing validity predicates](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/ledger/customize.html), transactions, or even [the matchmaker node](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/intent-gossip-and-matchmaker.html). For early end-users that are not intimidated by the command-line, it’s not too early to start with the basics, such as [setting up a wallet](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/wallet.html) with addresses, getting some testnet tokens from the faucet account, making transfers, and staking– or, for the most adventurous ones, a primer to Anoma as a [multivariate, multivariable protocol](https://twitter.com/awasunyin/status/1422508932635967489?s=20), you can start crafting custom intents and deploying them directly to the intents gossip network.\n\nMore in-depth reading:\n\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Intent Gossip & Matchmaking system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/)\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Validity Predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/)\n\n\\*[Stay tuned](https://twitter.com/anomanetwork) for a new series of articles on our blog that explain each role in the Anoma Network!\n\n## How do I participate in the Feigenbaum testnet?\n\nAs a public, permissionless testnet, anyone can join anonymously by pulling the code from the [repository](https://github.com/anoma/anoma/releases/tag/v0.2.0) and following the instructions in the [docs](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/).\n\nA few members from the team building Anoma will also be participating in the Feigenbaum testnet to ensure that it runs smoothly. Furthermore, some will be available on Anoma’s [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/RzN98vXbFt) (#feigenbaum channel) to help out with installation or any other issues, as well as for gathering user feedback.\n\nFinally, to stay up-to-date on all news and communications related to Anoma’s Feigenbaum and future testnets, we recommend that you fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/GLzTF37vwokbFYeW9) to receive the testnet newsletter.\n", "timestamp": 1635972438, "digest": "DbFUBoudp49HRTfowNlNjfI8gGH2hPkr30AFUnJQAGE", "contributor": "0x979AbfF1D6b676CeAC21AEeD3d800d48e6775be2"}
{"id": "oitbRI8c5OebmYkf16vBE2qAY_NlbjUHfCznInqa4Kw", "title": "Introducing Anoma: A Blockchain for Private Asset-Agnostic Bartering", "body": "## What is Anoma?\n\nAnoma is a sovereign, proof-of-stake blockchain that enables private, asset-agnostic bartering among *any number of parties*. To illustrate the capabilities of Anoma, we’ll go through three examples and provide an overview of some of the key components of the protocol.\n\n## Private transfers with one asset type\n\nIn the first example, there are two participants: Alice, residing in San Francisco, and Bob, residing in Zürich. Alice and Bob had dinner together abroad, before they returned to their respective countries. To settle the bill for dinner, Alice wants to pay Bob in BTC.\n\nIn this example, two parties wish to transact, where the sender’s asset type (BTC) coincides with the receiver’s asset type. The Anoma blockchain is able to settle this transaction in zero-knowledge privacy. On Anoma, observers will not be able to infer any information about this transaction between Alice and Bob. Additionally, this transaction will look indistinguishable from any other transaction involving BTC, ETH, or any other cryptocurrencies.\n\n## Private transfers with two asset types\n\nIn the second example, Alice is on a business trip in Shanghai and visits 1984 Bookstore & Café, a trendy coffee shop in the bustling megacity. Alice, who holds primarily BTC in her mobile wallet, wants to pay for coffee.\n\nJust like the first example, this transaction involves two parties: Alice and the coffee shop. However, the sender’s asset type (BTC) does not coincide with the recipient’s asset type, as the coffee shop only accepts CNY or CNYC, a stablecoin form of 人民币. Through Anoma, Alice can spend BTC and the coffee shop can receive CNYC.\n\nUnder the hood, the Anoma blockchain automatically facilitates exchange between BTC and CNYC at the best market rate at the time, and all intermediate transactions (sending BTC, the BTC/CNYC exchange, and receiving CNYC) benefit from privacy provided by a multi-denomination zero-knowledge transfer circuit, which enables different types of assets to share one anonymity set. This way, the privacy guarantees will not be limited by the transaction volume of each individual asset.\n\nThis transaction is enabled by Anoma’s custom-tailored state machine, which has an built-in trade system supporting cross-chain asset transfers and settlement, a novel account system based on *validity predicates*, and an *intent matching system* with liquidity incentivization.\n\n## N-party bartering\n\nIn the third example there are three parties: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice holds BTC and wants DOT, Bob holds ETH and wants BTC, and Charlie holds DOT and wants ETH.\n\nIn this case, there are three parties, and no two can directly trade with each other because their desires are pairwise mismatched. The Anoma intent matching system and blockchain are able to match and settle the wants of all three participants at the same time. In other words, Anoma enables *bartering *among all three parties, as Alice, Bob, and Charlie do not need to agree on a common means of exchange in order to satisfy their individual wants.\n\nUsing the components described above, combined with custom zero-knowledge circuits, all interactions involved in an *𝐍*-party barter can benefit from the same privacy guarantees as a simple two-party asset transfer. Moreover, users of Anoma can barter any types of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fungible-assets, non-fungible assets or any upcoming types that represent more complex valuables.\n\nLastly, the Anoma blockchain is equipped with a distributed key generation and threshold decryption scheme to prevent reordering transactions and front-running trades.\n\n## The motivations behind Anoma\n\nThe motivations behind Anoma are threefold: the loss of individual financial privacy, the loss of local financial sovereignty, and the inability of humankind to coordinate at scale.\n\nFirst, the loss of financial privacy is fueled by the non-consensual usage of sensitive data about each individual’s financial activity by third parties. In mild cases, this results in intrusive commercial practices, such as targeted advertising or monetization of sensitive information. In more severe cases, this contributes to national and foreign governmental and corporate surveillance programs.\n\nSecond, the loss of local financial sovereignty results from the dependence on traditional financial systems — from electronic forms of fiat currencies to the permissioned backbone of international wire transfers. These systems, which often consist of a complex web of direct and indirect intermediaries, are susceptible to capture by governments, who can leverage them to enforce their sanctions on domestic or foreign residents.\n\nThird, humankind lacks the tools to solve problems of a cross-border nature which require the coordination of large groups of distinct economic agents. An existentially threatening subset of them, *collective action problems*, are currently only addressable through mechanisms that rely on the intervention of governments. Unfortunately, said problems often transcend national borders, thereby rendering the enforcement capabilities of Westphalian nation states inadequate.\n\n## The vision behind Anoma\n\nThe Anoma blockchain protocol aims to facilitate “*Self-Sovereign Communities”* by providing tools that grant increased control to individuals and communities’ of the systems governing their day-to-day aspects and activities, such as financial privacy, sovereignty, and coordination.\n\nAs the first instances of the Anoma protocol focus on granting privacy-preserving financial tools, the Anoma blockchain protocol places special emphasis on supporting any kind of asset and on zero-knowledge privacy regardless of the denomination of the assets.\n\nThe purpose of *undefining money *refers to the removal of any artificial constraints around what can be used as money or *means of exchange*, providing higher flexibility and control to the users of the protocol in deciding what to use — be it assets created by others or assets they created themselves. Anoma’s focus on financial self-sovereignty is also illustrated by the ***N***-party barter system, which facilitates asset-agnostic private cash in the simplest cases, but can assist in exchange, trades, and other financial activities of entire communities.\n\nFinally, in alignment with the vision, the design of the Anoma blockchain protocol scales via *fractal scaling*. Simply put, each Anoma blockchain instance is designed to integrate seamlessly with other instances, which can be specialized geographically (e.g. when Alice pays for coffee in Shanghai, this transaction is settled by the Chinese instance of Anoma) or are tailored to satisfy the needs and purposes of any real-world or virtual community (e.g. an Anoma instance that allows Animal Crossing players to trade furniture).\n\n## The team building Anoma\n\nThe [Anoma blockchain](https://anoma.network/) protocol is being built by [Heliax](https://heliax.dev/), a team currently composed of 23 cross-disciplinary members and supported by the [Anoma Foundation](http://anoma.foundation/).\n", "timestamp": 1635972447, "digest": "SyS88QlX519evqadTbYa2r2sxQCB2B9FohFbR7vlVSU", "contributor": "0x979AbfF1D6b676CeAC21AEeD3d800d48e6775be2"}

Users can deposit their yield bearing tokens (such as stETH) which Tempus splits into tokenized principal and yield tokens. Those primitives can then be traded against each other through the custom Balancer v2 AMM. Tempus will offer capital-efficient fixed rate yields and high variable yields on various assets. For example, Tempus will be the first team to release fixed-rate ETH 2.0 staking through Lido. Tempus will also integrate Compound, Aave and Yearn.\n\n[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6gauHECShr) | [Github](https://github.com/tempus-finance) | [Medium](https://medium.com/@tempusfinance) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tempusfinance) | [Website](https://tempus.finance/)\n", "timestamp": 1635972476, "digest": "GAQnUo1jljXv9w30zP2KhFjLJmH8ZEbYZANUAthZTxM", "contributor": "0x979AbfF1D6b676CeAC21AEeD3d800d48e6775be2"}

Security is one of the most formidable challenges for smart contract implementation in present times. There exist concerns of inefficiencies, security breaches and some broken codes that could lead to high or unnecessary costs for any user of a protocol.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges with smart contract implementation is the fact that they have an irreversible nature and users can lose a part or whole of their funds deposited in a contract that has not been written effectively.\n\nSmart contract auditing is therefore important for the better optimization of codes and improves the performance of the smart contract, in a way that also benefits the user of that contract (for example — gas efficiency conditions), enhanced vaults or wallets on the protocols, security against hacks and more.\n\n## **Tempus Passes Security Audit of Coinspect**\n\nWe are happy to announce the completion of our first audit by [Coinspect](https://www.coinspect.com/) who were able to find only 3 medium risk bugs that have now all been fixed.\n\nAs explained by Coinspect, no high-risk vulnerabilities that would result in user funds being stolen were identified from the source code. One of the medium-risk issues detected could have a high impact but there was a low likelihood of that event taking place. This bug has now also been fixed. Other bugs are related to the power of the pool owners and whether they could update the fees without constraints and that could have an adverse impact on users in case the accounts were compromised.\n\nFind Coinspect’s audit report [here](https://www.coinspect.com/doc/Coinspect%20-%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20-%20Tempus%20v211013.pdf).\n\n## **Tempus Security Audit Competition at Code 423n4**\n\nTempus is a future yield tokenization and fixed-rate protocol that allows users to optimize their existing exposure to variable yield based on their risk tolerance. As we continue to build on other protocols it is important for us to make sure our contracts are secured in case there is a failure on the protocols that we are building on.\n\nEnterprise audits do not necessarily guarantee the quality and robustness of smart contracts. Instead of organising a bug bounty program ourselves, we decided to partner with [Code 423n4](https://code423n4.com/) that creates incentivised weekly smart contract audit competitions that allow some of the most talented security researchers to do a thorough security audit of the smart contracts. It uses a novel competitive mechanism that allows anyone to help secure protocols and platforms without having to be a full-time professional auditor. This approach is designed to increase the depth and breadth of an audit while incentivizing security researchers to find the highest-risk and rarest bugs.\n\nIn addition to that, it does not follow the approach of ‘first person to turn in the bug gets the bounty’. Instead, they reward everyone’s contributions even if there are multiple submissions of the same bug.\n\nThe smart contract audit competition for Tempus began** on** **October 14, 2021, at 00:00 UTC**.\n\nThis contest ends **on October 20, 2021, at 23:59 UTC**.\n\n**We have allocated $50,000 USDC for anyone who is able to find bugs or can help us improve gas optimization on Tempus.**\n\n**Read more about the contest **[**here**](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus)** and start now!**\n\n## **About Tempus**\n\nTempus is a protocol where users can re-allocate the risk of interest rate fluctuations between each other.

{"id": "uvOLU1YlD0lcIc9hoJXqqVRw-wO5V9kRndpoC9DSoCU", "title": "Introducing Anoma: A Blockchain for Private Asset-Agnostic Bartering", "body": "## What is Anoma?\n\nAnoma is a sovereign, proof-of-stake blockchain that enables private, asset-agnostic bartering among *any number of parties*. To illustrate the capabilities of Anoma, we’ll go through three examples and provide an overview of some of the key components of the protocol.\n\n## Private transfers with one asset type\n\nIn the first example, there are two participants: Alice, residing in San Francisco, and Bob, residing in Zürich. Alice and Bob had dinner together abroad, before they returned to their respective countries. To settle the bill for dinner, Alice wants to pay Bob in BTC.\n\nIn this example, two parties wish to transact, where the sender’s asset type (BTC) coincides with the receiver’s asset type. The Anoma blockchain is able to settle this transaction in zero-knowledge privacy. On Anoma, observers will not be able to infer any information about this transaction between Alice and Bob. Additionally, this transaction will look indistinguishable from any other transaction involving BTC, ETH, or any other cryptocurrencies.\n\n## Private transfers with two asset types\n\nIn the second example, Alice is on a business trip in Shanghai and visits 1984 Bookstore & Café, a trendy coffee shop in the bustling megacity. Alice, who holds primarily BTC in her mobile wallet, wants to pay for coffee.\n\nJust like the first example, this transaction involves two parties: Alice and the coffee shop. However, the sender’s asset type (BTC) does not coincide with the recipient’s asset type, as the coffee shop only accepts CNY or CNYC, a stablecoin form of 人民币. Through Anoma, Alice can spend BTC and the coffee shop can receive CNYC.\n\nUnder the hood, the Anoma blockchain automatically facilitates exchange between BTC and CNYC at the best market rate at the time, and all intermediate transactions (sending BTC, the BTC/CNYC exchange, and receiving CNYC) benefit from privacy provided by a multi-denomination zero-knowledge transfer circuit, which enables different types of assets to share one anonymity set. This way, the privacy guarantees will not be limited by the transaction volume of each individual asset.\n\nThis transaction is enabled by Anoma’s custom-tailored state machine, which has an built-in trade system supporting cross-chain asset transfers and settlement, a novel account system based on *validity predicates*, and an *intent matching system* with liquidity incentivization.\n\n## N-party bartering\n\nIn the third example there are three parties: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice holds BTC and wants DOT, Bob holds ETH and wants BTC, and Charlie holds DOT and wants ETH.\n\nIn this case, there are three parties, and no two can directly trade with each other because their desires are pairwise mismatched. The Anoma intent matching system and blockchain are able to match and settle the wants of all three participants at the same time. In other words, Anoma enables *bartering *among all three parties, as Alice, Bob, and Charlie do not need to agree on a common means of exchange in order to satisfy their individual wants.\n\nUsing the components described above, combined with custom zero-knowledge circuits, all interactions involved in an *𝐍*-party barter can benefit from the same privacy guarantees as a simple two-party asset transfer. Moreover, users of Anoma can barter any types of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fungible-assets, non-fungible assets or any upcoming types that represent more complex valuables.\n\nLastly, the Anoma blockchain is equipped with a distributed key generation and threshold decryption scheme to prevent reordering transactions and front-running trades.\n\n## The motivations behind Anoma\n\nThe motivations behind Anoma are threefold: the loss of individual financial privacy, the loss of local financial sovereignty, and the inability of humankind to coordinate at scale.\n\nFirst, the loss of financial privacy is fueled by the non-consensual usage of sensitive data about each individual’s financial activity by third parties. In mild cases, this results in intrusive commercial practices, such as targeted advertising or monetization of sensitive information. In more severe cases, this contributes to national and foreign governmental and corporate surveillance programs.\n\nSecond, the loss of local financial sovereignty results from the dependence on traditional financial systems — from electronic forms of fiat currencies to the permissioned backbone of international wire transfers. These systems, which often consist of a complex web of direct and indirect intermediaries, are susceptible to capture by governments, who can leverage them to enforce their sanctions on domestic or foreign residents.\n\nThird, humankind lacks the tools to solve problems of a cross-border nature which require the coordination of large groups of distinct economic agents. An existentially threatening subset of them, *collective action problems*, are currently only addressable through mechanisms that rely on the intervention of governments. Unfortunately, said problems often transcend national borders, thereby rendering the enforcement capabilities of Westphalian nation states inadequate.\n\n## The vision behind Anoma\n\nThe Anoma blockchain protocol aims to facilitate “*Self-Sovereign Communities”* by providing tools that grant increased control to individuals and communities’ of the systems governing their day-to-day aspects and activities, such as financial privacy, sovereignty, and coordination.\n\nAs the first instances of the Anoma protocol focus on granting privacy-preserving financial tools, the Anoma blockchain protocol places special emphasis on supporting any kind of asset and on zero-knowledge privacy regardless of the denomination of the assets.\n\nThe purpose of *undefining money *refers to the removal of any artificial constraints around what can be used as money or *means of exchange*, providing higher flexibility and control to the users of the protocol in deciding what to use — be it assets created by others or assets they created themselves. Anoma’s focus on financial self-sovereignty is also illustrated by the ***N***-party barter system, which facilitates asset-agnostic private cash in the simplest cases, but can assist in exchange, trades, and other financial activities of entire communities.\n\nFinally, in alignment with the vision, the design of the Anoma blockchain protocol scales via *fractal scaling*. Simply put, each Anoma blockchain instance is designed to integrate seamlessly with other instances, which can be specialized geographically (e.g. when Alice pays for coffee in Shanghai, this transaction is settled by the Chinese instance of Anoma) or are tailored to satisfy the needs and purposes of any real-world or virtual community (e.g. an Anoma instance that allows Animal Crossing players to trade furniture).\n\n## The team building Anoma\n\nThe [Anoma blockchain](https://anoma.network/) protocol is being built by [Heliax](https://heliax.dev/), a team currently composed of 23 cross-disciplinary members and supported by the [Anoma Foundation](http://anoma.foundation/).\n", "timestamp": 1635972400, "digest": "Sdm-8p_XmnfKM1jD86Gx1eoPNpYK4BSWoI3WgbwTE-Y", "contributor": "0x8CE12f759601C1F93C1c00F2E5b49897b6B468A9"}

Following the ethos of the project and its core developers, the current implementation of the protocol has been open-sourced — paving the way for a more accessible research and developer journey of Anoma.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PnediXxrICx7HafyHdFyyA.png)\n\n## In the Anoma codebase\n\nFrom the beginning of the year, the core developers of Anoma have been working continuously on the Anoma ledger, its intent gossip system, and the matchmaker system. The ledger is characterized by its integration with Tendermint BFT consensus and WASM, in addition to basic capabilities such as key-value store, transactions, and a command-line interface. Over the last moon cycle, the support for [validity predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/) on WASM, gas metering, and storage improvements among other changes were added to the ledger; the [intent gossip system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is able to broadcast and support simple token barter intents; and the [matchmaker](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/) is integrated with a WASM matching algorithm, allowing the system to match simple token barter intents. For a more in-depth view of the architecture of Anoma, take a look at the [documentation](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/).\n\n## Learning by playing with Anoma\n\nAs the design of the Anoma protocol is distinct in several ways, some features might appear unfamiliar, especially if you’re accustomed to protocols designed to be cryptocurrencies or platforms for arbitrary computation. Besides learning about Anoma via the growing base of resources, a swifter way for the playful minds would be by trying Anoma out.\n\nIf you’re interested in setting up your own local testnet of Anoma, you can find the guidelines for installing, building, operating an Anoma node [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#installing). You can also find the Rust docs for the Anoma crates [here](https://anomanetwork.github.io/anoma/rustdoc/anoma/). Some of the most notable interactions involve validity predicates, creating and submitting *intents*, and operating the intent gossip and matchmaker systems.\n\n## Contributing to Anoma\n\nNothing would delight the core developers of Anoma more than feedback on the design, code, or documentation from the community at any scale — from typos to reviews on the design. Find the contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma#how-to-contribute) and a list of open issues [here](https://github.com/anomanetwork/anoma/issues).\n\nIf you feel aligned with the vision of Anoma and would be interested in getting more involved with the project, know that the current team is growing and looking for more team members driven by the purpose of making privacy-preserving and self-sovereignty tools accessible. Take a look at this [list of open positions](https://heliax.dev/jobs), including but not limited to distributed systems research, zero-knowledge cryptography research and protocol engineering in Rust.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nAn upcoming development of the Anoma protocol is in the works and it combines the above with proof-of-stake and a dynamic validator selection mechanism. Later, support for [Ferveo](https://anoma.network/blog/ferveo-a-distributed-key-generation-scheme-for-front-running-protection) for front-running protection will be integrated, with other notable features to follow. The prototype is being refined along with the technical specifications and documentation in preparation for the very first experimental public testnet of Anoma.

It’s a community.”\n\nNo arguments here. I firmly believe one of the reasons CrossFit thrives today is its community. The reason people pay a lot of money for CrossFit is community. The reason most people stay active members at their gyms is community.\n\nPeople want to feel a part of something.\n\nBut something very interesting happened during the pandemic. CrossFit’s founder, Greg Glassman, was ousted for making insensitive tweets about the George Floyd situation, and further allegations of sexism, racism and homophobia were disclosed.\n\nIn the various articles that reported this, Glassman was described as a co-founder and then sole owner of CrossFit. All major organizational decisions were ultimately signed off by one person. The CEO. Glassman.\n\nMany affiliates (gyms officially associated with CrossFit HQ) distanced themselves from the organization, removed the term “CrossFit” from their names, and began saying that their methodology was functional fitness. The underlying sentiment was that CrossFit the community was separate from HQ.\n\nThis change, which many reverted when Glassman stepped down, showed the ability for CrossFit to decentralize. The pandemic showed that affiliates have the ability to manage their communities online. The various programs offered by professional CrossFit athletes proved that you don’t even need to join an affiliate. These programs’ workouts are organized similarly to local gyms, and the online community can provide the same sense of belonging.\n\nThis is all amazing. Despite losing one of its strongest attributes with in-person community and relationships, most affiliates managed to stay afloat. Members didn’t cancel their memberships, they rented equipment to take home, and everyone rode out the Covid wave while it lasted.\n\nThe biggest issue with all of this? Ownership.\n\n\n---\n\nThe hardest thing when managing an online community is incentivizing its members to remain active. Many try do this through various channels. Zoom classes, swag drops, the occasional (but painfully awkward) meet and greets… They all get some initial participation going, but for most, the activity wains as new members’ initial enthusiasm drops.\n\nAlso, the lack of coordination from gyms at the top level was a concern. Many gyms remain (officially or unofficially) disaffiliated with CrossFit HQ and have decided to go in their own direction. This lack of coordination can lead to a poor end product, which ends up with people getting physically hurt. Five times CrossFit Games champion Mat Fraser brought this up on Joe Rogan’s podcast.\n\nI’ll spare you all from the crypto promo, but something made possible by crypto is a truly decentralized organizational structure. One that gives everyone the opportunity to own a stake, and participate within the organization at the speed they’d like to.\n\nThis structure could create CrossFit’s 3.0 dream or nightmare. 1.0 was inception. 2.0 was the use of technology to track and scale the progress of CrossFit communities and its members.\n\n3\\.0 is something much more powerful.\n\n3\\.0 will be inspired by the Web3 revolution. It will incentivize community members through financial capital, and will build upon the social capital that CrossFit has already generated.\n\nI wrote above that online CrossFit at times was painful, but it doesn’t have to be. With more coordination, standardization of communication channels, and a hierarchy based on CrossFit-related competence, combined with participation and ownership, there could be a real engine that redefines what it means to be a part of a fitness community.\n\nLet’s break down the four things (in my opinion) that are most pressing to build this type of engine.\n\n\n---\n\n**1. Ownership**\n\nIn order for someone to be an owner, they need to provide value to the organization. In order to receive ownership for providing value, there needs to be a treasury (sum of money) where collateral can be added and capital can be distributed from.\n\nThe best way to organize this is through digital tokens. A group of early founders create a token pool and put up their own individual capital to receive portions of the pool. They then allocate certain percentages of the pool for future members to invest, earn through participation and they can also allocate tokens for other initiatives they find important. For example, scholarship funds or community programs.\n\nThis form of incentivisation creates financial reward and gain for members of the community as it grows, scales and increases in relevancy and mind share in the world.\n\nPeople like making money.\n\n**2. Social Capital**\n\nAs mentioned, one of CrossFit’s best attributes is its community. If the community structure and organization were to move online, there is still a real human element that can be leveraged.\n\nSay that members of this online community have engaged with each other for certain periods of time, and one travels to a part of the world where the other lives. They can meet up at the gym for a workout, have a coffee or a beer, anything. The physical locations are already in place for this; there just needs to be better coordination and incentives to go out and interact within said locations.\n\nPeople already drop in to CrossFit gyms when they’re on the road (for outrageous fees may I add). This experience provides most a great workout, a greeting or two, but that’s really it.\n\nDoing this, however, through a format that is powered by an online community which you own a stake in will make the human experience more meaningful, memorable and worthwhile.\n\nI love dropping in to gyms, but imagine a world where your drop-in is actually a long awaited meet up? This is a better form of community.\n\n**3. Hierarchy & Governance**\n\nFounding members would need to have some form of credibility within CrossFit, or functional fitness in general. While wild west scenarios are fun, poor competence structures in this scenario would result in people getting physically hurt.\n\nTherefore, the founding team would need to create an onboarding process that determines a person’s competence level related to CrossFit. They would also need to create an onboarding process that enables aspiring contributors to work on the projects they want to.\n\n**Hierarchy**\n\nFor example, let’s say someone enters the community. They’ve purchased tokens and are now a member of the organization. Where do they stand in the hierarchy?\n\nThe organization creates an exam that members take to show their knowledge of CrossFit and/or functional fitness. Their score then determines where they stand in the competence hierarchy. Let’s say there are three levels to this. 3) Member 2) Athlete 1) Coach.\n\nPeople who join the community are explicitly told that coaches are those who provide fitness guidance, athletes can help with less pressing questions, and members are good to chat with. This hierarchy doesn’t exclude people from participation in various projects, it rather establishes a group of people where community members can route their fitness specific questions.\n\n**Contributing**\n\nThe other side of this is the onboarding of members who want to contribute. This can be done fairly easily at the beginning. Community members are asked where they want to participate, they are encouraged to engage in that area’s communication channels and are awarded with tokens as they complete projects.\n\nIf they were not previously token holders, they then become members of the organization and are assigned to the third level of the fitness competence hierarchy until passing the “exam” to move up.\n\n**Governance**\n\nThe two subjects discussed previously do not affect governance. Governance determines the direction of the organization, and there are many models that can be followed. To not dive down a technical rabbit hole, we’ll keep this explanation shorter.\n\nAny decision that affects the organization should be voted on by its members. Anyone who has ownership (owns tokens) in the organization can vote on proposals that would affect the future state of the organization. This furthers the financial incentivisation that members have, and will likely keep them more active and invested in the organization’s future.\n\nIt changes the game completely. HQ doesn’t tell you what to do. People submit proposals and members vote yes or no. If there are more yes votes than no, the proposal passes.\n\nA democratic fitness organization. Who would’ve thought?\n\nPS. There are many ways to determine the weight and value of someone’s vote. I would recommend googling *coin voting blockchain* and *quadratic voting blockchain* to understand this better.\n\n**4. Coordination**\n\nThe biggest hurdle that a prospective organization like this faces is coordination. Founding members will need to quickly establish the communication channels, member onboarding, the organization’s economics (tokenomics), and the governance structure.\n\nBy doing this, the organization will have a clear strategic narrative, new members won’t feel lost in a likely new world, and the community will be able to operate autonomously while maintaining its vision.\n\nIf these processes are quickly established, prior to scale, the end product of a CrossFit 3.0 will be far superior than its current state.\n\n\n---\n\nCrossFit has changed my life for the better, and I couldn’t agree more with its philosophy and approach to sport, health and wellness. However, with another economic revolution on the horizon, it’s important that organizations that heavily rely on community understand the power of Web3 and DAO organizational structures.\n\nReason being, the decentralization experiment for CrossFit has produced a lot of economic upside for HQ and the influential persons associated with it and the CrossFit Games. Again this wasn’t and isn’t a bad thing, but it’s important to understand as generational and economic circumstances transform, organizations must transform with them. Otherwise, they will become increasingly irrelevant and possibly fail.\n\nA truly decentralized CrossFit that gives community ownership and a voice is an interesting proposition. One I believe would succeed. The economic distribution will change from few to all, and the social community will change from local to global.", "timestamp": 1635972878, "digest": "v2ZEBQAQTPYdLPtnxx2g7r4kYW8BRfrfCn_DsElRcbY", "contributor": "0xa32D089F144e613106072fE2Ec4FF2ff95b7606D"}

It’s a community.”\n\nNo arguments here. I firmly believe one of the reasons CrossFit thrives today is its community. The reason people pay a lot of money for CrossFit is community. The reason most people stay active members at their gyms is community.\n\nPeople want to feel a part of something.\n\nBut something very interesting happened during the pandemic. CrossFit’s founder, Greg Glassman, was ousted for making insensitive tweets about the George Floyd situation, and further allegations of sexism, racism and homophobia were disclosed.\n\nIn the various articles that reported this, Glassman was described as a co-founder and then sole owner of CrossFit. All major organizational decisions were ultimately signed off by one person. The CEO. Glassman.\n\nMany affiliates (gyms officially associated with CrossFit HQ) distanced themselves from the organization, removed the term “CrossFit” from their names, and began saying that their methodology was functional fitness.

there was a lot to be found within that yield.\n\nAn overarching force to bind, and a backdrop for the thoughts to unwind.\n\nNot just limited to a minor point, but extending indefinitely as a part of the whole joint.\n\nWith forces acting in it, the senses of the dual minds had a way to both be lit.\n\nStarting as a wish to be in the clouds, these ideations were heard aloud.\n\nParticles and planets akin, there were now minds found at all levels within.\n\nCorporeal Jove.\n\nFurther down into the core, the properties he wondered what they were for.\n\nThe heart of its mind and the mind of its heart, it now revealed to play a major part.\n\nThe storms were now organs of this beast, with the red spot partaking in a sensory feast.\n\nThe eye of the storm was a literal eye, gathering light borrowed from the sky.\n\nAll other senses were still mysteries, something to be found out from observing its atmospheric seas.\n\nBut with a being starting to form, it provided insights that out of seeing were born.\n\nPicking up phenomenon just as us, but with this one from its hefty gusts.\n\nThe Way Beheld.\n\nThis being now observed had so much to say, in its words it actually showed the way.\n\nHeld within the line of sight, nothing to be seen except for the mind set alight.\n\nTo the eye, it was all invisible, but to the mind it was entirely possible.\n\nIt was there and it couldn't be refuted, but cognitively it was quite disputed.\n\nWas it something of a resonance, revealing to him its overly grand presence?\n\nNothing can be said of how it really did look, yet somewhere in the cortex was an odd nook.\n\nWhat it provided was a way forward, leaving not but a trace soon afterward.\n\nHis Cosmos.\n\nDirected yet nowhere to go, something had lingered from after the show.\n\nIt sat and festered waiting to bloom, stuck in his head it started to loom.\n\nThere was truth to be had, still undiscovered, the answer was soon to be recovered\n\nResoundingly he uttered My Cosmos!, again he proudly said, It's my Cosmos!.\n\nThere was no truth to it being said at the time, as it had to be digested and made into a crime.\n\nThere some guilt that it was all his, but after all, it was part of his wish.\n\nInto dreams others that eureka moment went, but now his self started to fragment.\n\nParallel Lives.\n\nPerceptions of one were now quite lucid, with previously attached identity become more fluid.\n\nWith past and future now coalesced, a splitting of time and mind was then professed.\n\nThings of a static nature seemingly upset, taking on dynamics as of not yet met.\n\nA swift rift developed somewhere from deep, so much that there was nothing to keep.\n\nWho he once was now long gone, but many new selves soon came along.\n\nWithin these alien skins, there was nothing of which to be considered akin.\n\nThe ripples had calmed and some had formed, becoming grand he was finally warmed.\n\nCybernetic Angel.\n\nWading out to the outer limits, there were things only a god of technological future could permit.\n\nThere must have been some kind of ascent, as up from earth this new being was sent.\n\nAn amalgamated higher being, from future and past, this synthesis was fleeing.\n\nWith a mechanized eye and three wings on its back, there was nothing it did lack.\n\nUsing its powers of higher intensity, to do good for others became its propensity.\n\nComing above from the stars, to mitigate the pain of the scars.\n\nWith this of self now depleted, its goals and strivings were all but completed.\n\nRed Green Blue Triad.\n\nSeeing is to be more than a belief, the next perception coming not quite with relief.\n\nSplit into a spectral red, green, and blue, nothing about this could be fully seen as true.\n\nWith the colors all under the hood, they did what they did, what was what they should.\n\nNot present, but out of the time they have been, they complemented what was yet to be seen.\n\nAs prophetic as that all may sound, nowhere in life were they to be found.\n\nBut the vision which they provided, in their wake left the two minded planets divided.\n\nA potential within the trinity of hues, they were all within the perceiver, sharing their cues.\n\nThe warmest one out of the bunch, give some clues towards the next hunch.\n\nTerran Counterpart.\n\nWith one planet in its gaseous glory, and the other telling a biological story.\n\nThe eye of the storm had some insight, as the ideas of what could be, started to take flight.\n\nThe lensed spot greatly red had no brother, not a green one nor blue one nor some other.\n\nOne perceiver in the rockier land, flailing around had created some gusts at the whim of his hand.\n\nLike a butterfly in its fullest effect, a gale soon formed imperceptible to detect.\n\nNow in cohort with the great mind's endeavor, something to play out forever and ever.\n\nTo be seen is to be received, and with new sight, this was being achieved.\n\nRoyal Eyes of Sol.\n\nWith more to be noticed from a new set of eyes, came a question not yet realized.\n\nWonder what had started its course, it had to find out the initial source.\n\nThe little perceiver having eyes of his own, seeing from whom it was sown.\n\nIt was the sun above which they were under, the intention of this star was to visually plunder.\n\nAll one day to be subsumed, if not for the perceiver's blue irises it was assumed.\n\nWith this came high prestige, for all things are to be seen and to appease.\n\nAdding on novel responsibilities, the perceiver had a job to do with the best of his abilities.\n\nPlanetary Duties.\n\nWhat looks to us as though a work of art, was actually its purpose and was an integral part.\n\nThe warm-hued swirls blown about, to resemble the giant, the perceiver did shout.\n\nThe barren red one was the blue and green's directive, it's unpainted canvas was Jove's protective.\n\nOther bodies were already colored in, but damaged by time were their surface's skins.\n\nEarth as well being just a project done, and nearing completion, had almost won.\n\nTo carry on the torch of the mission, next in line is Mars was Jove's admission.\n\nWith all of this now in the perceiver's eyes, to make this whole and come to realize.\n\nBecoming All.\n\nReturning back to his own cavity of self, these concepts imagined were for the moment put on the shelf.\n\nAfter the being became the godhead and one with the creation of all, it occurred in a second just looking down the hall.\n\nUnexplainable in any terms known, but having a deeply true nature, the perceiver was shown.\n\nThe previous perceptions to this all led, as a god he had seen it was within and wholly his head.\n\nFrom Jove to Sol and further above, all that was brought down was agape love.\n\nEverything at once and once with everything, he could rightfully claim My Cosmos! in which he was king.\n\nSeeing above and further yonder, the universe was still empty of sonder.\n\nNow Intergalactic.\n\nA received message from Jove was accepted, light into his stormy eye wasn't just recepted.\n\nIt was a victory of finding life, an end to the long run of solitude and strife.\n\nWith the artful mission in their hands, there were many more creations to be found in far-off lands.\n\nFrom Sol's soul to those of other suns, they all had their very own daughters and sons.\n\nNeither interstellar nor interplanetary, but on the grandest of scales their communion was merry.\n\nA deep longing on a subconscious level, the perceiver's new friends shared joy and revel.\n\nTo the stars and heavens that hang, making celebratory noise they started to clang.\n\nMountain Contact.\n\nNow time to leave home and hearth, taking off and soon waving goodbye to earth.\n\nBefore feet left the ground below, the perceiver was included to be in the know.\n\nTo be held atop a local mountain, there was to be an extravagant celebration.\n\nA feast for the senses and what was received, later to be found out to just be deceived.\n\nIt all took place with the perceiver left out, pacing back forth expressing a facial pout.\n\nSadly, up to space was not in his cards, everything was a hoax that he had to discard.\n\nBut there were unseen rewards he could sweep, into the smallest scale did minds now seep.\n\nRaw Qualia.\n\nSenses appearing seeming unadulterated, their features usually staunchy, now all cooperated.\n\nMeaning imbued with each and every bit, their purpose revealed and largely writ.\n\nWas this indeed the perceiver's gift, or did he wonder was it all a grift?\n\nThe colorful triad now in space anew, the reason they appeared from pieces only he knew.\n\nColor and form and sound abound, there again, their meaning had been found all around.\n\nIt happened all in a flash, with the articulations of them gone in a quick dash.\n\nLeft with something to be understood now, the mental qualities had taken their bow.\n\nThe Great Goddess.\n\nConcealing what was revealing, the cracks were patched up after their peeling.\n\nAs mediation from yet the greatest source, this presence had an immense force.\n\nTo sustain reality and its fabric, the great queen had done her trick.\n\nToo had been much to be seen, and not something for this smallest of a perceiving being.\n\nBack into the shadows for the bits of mind, after the magic, the perceiver could no longer find.\n\nStill lost nowhere, or somewhere, in the lack of confines, not entirely sure if he will ever be fine.\n\nReassured by her highest majesty, finally some normalcy the perceiver could finally see.\n\nReturn Home.\n\nAt home and hearth, this all outplayed, but everything perceived was in the mind and displayed.\n\nNowhere but in one spot did it all transpire, yet to greater heights did he now aspire.\n\nThey will say it was all in his head, but so does everything while we're sleeping in our beds.\n\nJust hallucinations and delusions, but more in nature to be seen as perceptual illusions.\n\nTaking place in a realm of all residents, meeting beings far greater than mere presidents.\n\nTaking something back but what exactly, nothing that could be seen certain and factly.\n\nBack to home and life ordinary, but having something in mind most extraordinary.\n", "timestamp": 1635974306, "digest": "QNR4UkHYlnj1j7afWQ2OXrZzSQte6L9V99uKQqu1iGU", "contributor":

there was a lot to be found within that yield.\n\nAn overarching force to bind, and a backdrop for the thoughts to unwind.\n\nNot just limited to a minor point, but extending indefinitely as a part of the whole joint.\n\nWith forces acting in it, the senses of the dual minds had a way to both be lit.\n\nStarting as a wish to be in the clouds, these ideations were heard aloud.\n\nParticles and planets akin, there were now minds found at all levels within.\n\nCorporeal Jove.\n\nFurther down into the core, the properties he wondered what they were for.\n\nThe heart of its mind and the mind of its heart, it now revealed to play a major part.\n\nThe storms were now organs of this beast, with the red spot partaking in a sensory feast.\n\nThe eye of the storm was a literal eye, gathering light borrowed from the sky.\n\nAll other senses were still mysteries, something to be found out from observing its atmospheric seas.\n\nBut with a being starting to form, it provided insights that out of seeing were born.\n\nPicking up phenomenon just as us, but with this one from its hefty gusts.\n\nThe Way Beheld.\n\nThis being now observed had so much to say, in its words it actually showed the way.\n\nHeld within the line of sight, nothing to be seen except for the mind set alight.\n\nTo the eye, it was all invisible, but to the mind it was entirely possible.\n\nIt was there and it couldn't be refuted, but cognitively it was quite disputed.\n\nWas it something of a resonance, revealing to him its overly grand presence?\n\nNothing can be said of how it really did look, yet somewhere in the cortex was an odd nook.\n\nWhat it provided was a way forward, leaving not but a trace soon afterward.\n\nHis Cosmos.\n\nDirected yet nowhere to go, something had lingered from after the show.\n\nIt sat and festered waiting to bloom, stuck in his head it started to loom.\n\nThere was truth to be had, still undiscovered, the answer was soon to be recovered\n\nResoundingly he uttered My Cosmos!, again he proudly said, It's my Cosmos!.\n\nThere was no truth to it being said at the time, as it had to be digested and made into a crime.\n\nThere some guilt that it was all his, but after all, it was part of his wish.\n\nInto dreams others that eureka moment went, but now his self started to fragment.\n\nParallel Lives.\n\nPerceptions of one were now quite lucid, with previously attached identity become more fluid.\n\nWith past and future now coalesced, a splitting of time and mind was then professed.\n\nThings of a static nature seemingly upset, taking on dynamics as of not yet met.\n\nA swift rift developed somewhere from deep, so much that there was nothing to keep.\n\nWho he once was now long gone, but many new selves soon came along.\n\nWithin these alien skins, there was nothing of which to be considered akin.\n\nThe ripples had calmed and some had formed, becoming grand he was finally warmed.\n\nCybernetic Angel.\n\nWading out to the outer limits, there were things only a god of technological future could permit.\n\nThere must have been some kind of ascent, as up from earth this new being was sent.\n\nAn amalgamated higher being, from future and past, this synthesis was fleeing.\n\nWith a mechanized eye and three wings on its back, there was nothing it did lack.\n\nUsing its powers of higher intensity, to do good for others became its propensity.\n\nComing above from the stars, to mitigate the pain of the scars.\n\nWith this of self now depleted, its goals and strivings were all but completed.\n\nRed Green Blue Triad.\n\nSeeing is to be more than a belief, the next perception coming not quite with relief.\n\nSplit into a spectral red, green, and blue, nothing about this could be fully seen as true.\n\nWith the colors all under the hood, they did what they did, what was what they should.\n\nNot present, but out of the time they have been, they complemented what was yet to be seen.\n\nAs prophetic as that all may sound, nowhere in life were they to be found.\n\nBut the vision which they provided, in their wake left the two minded planets divided.\n\nA potential within the trinity of hues, they were all within the perceiver, sharing their cues.\n\nThe warmest one out of the bunch, give some clues towards the next hunch.\n\nTerran Counterpart.\n\nWith one planet in its gaseous glory, and the other telling a biological story.\n\nThe eye of the storm had some insight, as the ideas of what could be, started to take flight.\n\nThe lensed spot greatly red had no brother, not a green one nor blue one nor some other.\n\nOne perceiver in the rockier land, flailing around had created some gusts at the whim of his hand.\n\nLike a butterfly in its fullest effect, a gale soon formed imperceptible to detect.\n\nNow in cohort with the great mind's endeavor, something to play out forever and ever.\n\nTo be seen is to be received, and with new sight, this was being achieved.\n\nRoyal Eyes of Sol.\n\nWith more to be noticed from a new set of eyes, came a question not yet realized.\n\nWonder what had started its course, it had to find out the initial source.\n\nThe little perceiver having eyes of his own, seeing from whom it was sown.\n\nIt was the sun above which they were under, the intention of this star was to visually plunder.\n\nAll one day to be subsumed, if not for the perceiver's blue irises it was assumed.\n\nWith this came high prestige, for all things are to be seen and to appease.\n\nAdding on novel responsibilities, the perceiver had a job to do with the best of his abilities.\n\nPlanetary Duties.\n\nWhat looks to us as though a work of art, was actually its purpose and was an integral part.\n\nThe warm-hued swirls blown about, to resemble the giant, the perceiver did shout.\n\nThe barren red one was the blue and green's directive, it's unpainted canvas was Jove's protective.\n\nOther bodies were already colored in, but damaged by time were their surface's skins.\n\nEarth as well being just a project done, and nearing completion, had almost won.\n\nTo carry on the torch of the mission, next in line is Mars was Jove's admission.\n\nWith all of this now in the perceiver's eyes, to make this whole and come to realize.\n\nBecoming All.\n\nReturning back to his own cavity of self, these concepts imagined were for the moment put on the shelf.\n\nAfter the being became the godhead and one with the creation of all, it occurred in a second just looking down the hall.\n\nUnexplainable in any terms known, but having a deeply true nature, the perceiver was shown.\n\nThe previous perceptions to this all led, as a god he had seen it was within and wholly his head.\n\nFrom Jove to Sol and further above, all that was brought down was agape love.\n\nEverything at once and once with everything, he could rightfully claim My Cosmos! in which he was king.\n\nSeeing above and further yonder, the universe was still empty of sonder.\n\nNow Intergalactic.\n\nA received message from Jove was accepted, light into his stormy eye wasn't just recepted.\n\nIt was a victory of finding life, an end to the long run of solitude and strife.\n\nWith the artful mission in their hands, there were many more creations to be found in far-off lands.\n\nFrom Sol's soul to those of other suns, they all had their very own daughters and sons.\n\nNeither interstellar nor interplanetary, but on the grandest of scales their communion was merry.\n\nA deep longing on a subconscious level, the perceiver's new friends shared joy and revel.\n\nTo the stars and heavens that hang, making celebratory noise they started to clang.\n\nMountain Contact.\n\nNow time to leave home and hearth, taking off and soon waving goodbye to earth.\n\nBefore feet left the ground below, the perceiver was included to be in the know.\n\nTo be held atop a local mountain, there was to be an extravagant celebration.\n\nA feast for the senses and what was received, later to be found out to just be deceived.\n\nIt all took place with the perceiver left out, pacing back forth expressing a facial pout.\n\nSadly, up to space was not in his cards, everything was a hoax that he had to discard.\n\nBut there were unseen rewards he could sweep, into the smallest scale did minds now seep.\n\nRaw Qualia.\n\nSenses appearing seeming unadulterated, their features usually staunchy, now all cooperated.\n\nMeaning imbued with each and every bit, their purpose revealed and largely writ.\n\nWas this indeed the perceiver's gift, or did he wonder was it all a grift?\n\nThe colorful triad now in space anew, the reason they appeared from pieces only he knew.\n\nColor and form and sound abound, there again, their meaning had been found all around.\n\nIt happened all in a flash, with the articulations of them gone in a quick dash.\n\nLeft with something to be understood now, the mental qualities had taken their bow.\n\nThe Great Goddess.\n\nConcealing what was revealing, the cracks were patched up after their peeling.\n\nAs mediation from yet the greatest source, this presence had an immense force.\n\nTo sustain reality and its fabric, the great queen had done her trick.\n\nToo had been much to be seen, and not something for this smallest of a perceiving being.\n\nBack into the shadows for the bits of mind, after the magic, the perceiver could no longer find.\n\nStill lost nowhere, or somewhere, in the lack of confines, not entirely sure if he will ever be fine.\n\nReassured by her highest majesty, finally some normalcy the perceiver could finally see.\n\nReturn Home.\n\nAt home and hearth, this all outplayed, but everything perceived was in the mind and displayed.\n\nNowhere but in one spot did it all transpire, yet to greater heights did he now aspire.\n\nThey will say it was all in his head, but so does everything while we're sleeping in our beds.\n\nJust hallucinations and delusions, but more in nature to be seen as perceptual illusions.\n\nTaking place in a realm of all residents, meeting beings far greater than mere presidents.\n\nTaking something back but what exactly, nothing that could be seen certain and factly.\n\nBack to home and life ordinary, but having something in mind most extraordinary.\n", "timestamp": 1635974481, "digest": "QNR4UkHYlnj1j7afWQ2OXrZzSQte6L9V99uKQqu1iGU", "contributor":

{"id": "V_cXXlYLBnqZu6dilJOrWzyCgEgEpIpEzGuKXnOL3UM", "title": "Coinbase Lend Fucks Everything", "body": "I may have oversold here. But 4% APY risk-free is a problem, and the SEC knows it.\n\nLend theoretically enables customers to earn 4% APY on their cash (USDC), risk-free, simply by parking money in their Coinbase account. From a user experience perspective, there’s little difference between holding your money with Coinbase Lend and holding it in a savings account. However, 4% APY is exponentially higher than your typical savings account rate, which means there’s a significant incentive to move money from banks to Coinbase. But that’s only the beginning.\n\nConsider interest rates. The “Prime Rate” is shorthand for the interest rate banks charge their highest quality customers, like large corporations. This rate serves as the basis for all sorts of other interest rates. Today, it’s \\~3.25%. So, the best companies can get debt at 3.25% and rates rise from there in accordance with creditworthiness. \n\nThis is the basis of the banking business model. The bank accepts deposits, pays .1% APY on those deposits, and then lends that money at 3.25%+ and keeps the difference. That’s the game at its most basic level. \n\nCoinbase Lend provides a higher return than lending at the prime rate.\n\nIn traditional finance, institutions keep 90%+ of the value generated via capital by lending at 3-6% and giving just .1% to depositors. In cryptoland, most of the work done by traditional financial institutions is outsourced to code, so 90% of the value accrues back to capital providers. *Financial services become a public good.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eqA20rqLSM-6kJkPEkXW_.png?height=624&width=1252)\n\nThis isn’t just a product with a better interest rate. *It’s a paradigm shift in how value is distributed.*\n\nNone of this is unique to Coinbase. In fact, it’s less true of Coinbase than it is of DeFi, where a 4% annual return is negligible. However, most Americans aren’t ready to use a DeFi protocol. As a public company with a fiat offramp, Coinbase can bring this (watered down) offering to a mass market at scale, which is why it makes sense for the SEC to reject Coinbase’s version of a product that’s already commonplace elsewhere, leading to what Brian Armstrong called “unequal enforcement”.\n\nCoinbase Lend would be a step change in both UX and trust, making 4% APY just a bank transfer away. Someday, 100 million people could conceivably use this product. The potential volume is what shifts markets and stirs the SEC.\n\nIt is unclear what kind of downstream impact this could have. All sorts of financial products from annuities, to life insurance, to funds are built on the current rules, where government bonds get 1% and top tier corporate bonds get 3%. Billions of dollars of financialization happen on top of these bonds and financial companies have major political sway.\n\nAdditionally, government bonds can’t conceivably compete with this return unless interest rates increase significantly, which would cause the cost of servicing the national debt to explode. More likely, interest rates will remain low in the short term and  as a result, bonds could lose value as demand for them wanes.\n\nIf consumers have access to a 4% risk-free option, many popular investments will become much less appealing to the average person very quickly. This could be destabilizing for traditional finance, especially if inflation continues to rise and crypto becomes a mainstream solution for “fighting inflation” as commentators search for talking points. Significant destabilization is probably contingent on institutions pivoting into products like Coinbase Lend, but in the medium term, why wouldn’t they?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/x4ZwUc1cne7AzZlRHIPMh.png?height=782&width=1278)\n\nCoinbase’s offering is good enough to be a risk. And 4% is just the \"starter rate”, just wait for 5% and 6%.\n\nEventually this product will launch. Over the next decade, the inversion of the distribution of lending profits will change the world in ways we can’t predict. It’s the beginning of the end, and the SEC needs more time to wrap their head around it.", "timestamp": 1635975040, "digest": "wptq3wrQU_2GxR57D9AxgoFepGk7F2kLutzQU-zlp2I", "contributor": "0x0D358B96cF7B5B05E0F2e97E30916E7D3C623e6B"}

{"id": "Xpr-W6MGIpDH1tO1eQNRwlvfu9D2Zj8uiLRvNC4hMXA", "title": "Tutorial: How to Provide Liquidity on Trader Joe — Mirror", "body": "## What is Trader Joe?\n\n[Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/home) is an AMM style decentralized exchange on Avalanche. Trader Joe combines DEX services with DeFi lending to offer leveraged trading. Trader Joe’s products are community driven which allows them to allocate fees collected from liquidation and swaps back to the users via the JOE/xJOE staking mechanism. JOE is a governance token that also rewards its holders with a share of exchange revenues.\n\n## What is Avalanche?\n\n[Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/) is a [layer one](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) blockchain created to host all kind of distributed applications. As another blockchain with similar utility to Ethereum, Avalanche has made small changes to how the blockchain works to optimize for speed and scalability. Avalanche aims to not only be a short term compliment to Ethereum but possibly even a substitute. Avalanche has a unique architecture. It consists of three unique chains: X-Chain, C-Chain and P-Chain. With each chain having its own purpose. Something interesting about Avalanche is that each chain uses a different consensus mechanism.\n\n## What is an AMM/CFMM?\n\nConstant Function Market Makers (CFMMs) are a classification of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) which have been applied to crypto DeFi markets. CFMMs were pioneered by several projects in the crypto community to create decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for digital asset trading and based on a mathematical function establishing a pre-defined set of prices based on the assets held in a liquidity pool. Whereas a traditional order book-based exchanges (OBs/CLOBs), traders trade against a specific counter-party.\n\n## Why Deposit Liquidity in Trader Joe?\n\nSome investors/traders may want to Provide Liquidity (LP) in an AMM style DEX for various reasons. One popular reason is the ability to earn rewards in the native governance token of the platform. This reward structure can be used to offset a concept known as [impermanent loss (IL)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/impermanent-loss) which is when someone’s assets in a pool lose relative value when the price of one asset changes dramatically against the other asset. The concept of earning tokens for staking LP tokens is referred to as [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-yield-farming) and can be done under the “Farm” tab on [Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/farm).\n\n## A step-by-step guide on how to lend assets on Trader Joe:\n\n* Visit [https://traderjoexyz.com](https://traderjoexyz.com/) and connect your wallet.\n\n![Trader Joe Connect Wallet Pop Up](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FefB_GbeDHGtEh7AgCYgGX.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n* If your wallet is not on the Avalanche Network, a window will prompt you to switch to the network.

What if you could fund your startup while aligning your community with your upside? \n\nA group of Internet friends came together to reflect on these questions. The result was[ The Modern Billboard Collective](https://themodernbillboard.com/) – a collective of startups selling ad space on their website represented as NFTs that are freely tradable.  \n\n**[Get notified when we launch. ](https://airtable.com/shrQbP4UOfnSYpRlS)**Read for more 👇\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/u2jOBUAjrZEyJULCv1lrr.png?height=4096&width=6740&&size=medium)\n\n\n---\n\nWe turned to inspiration in the unlikeliest of places…the [Million Dollar Homepage](http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/).\n\nThe Million Dollar Homepage was a project created by [Alex Tew](https://twitter.com/tewy) (fun fact: he is now the founder of [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) 🤯) in 2005 where he sold one million pixels for $1 each to pay for school. Each pixel gave its owner the right to add a logo and link out to a website to drive traffic. \n\nIt took Alex two weeks to convince friends and family to purchase the first 47 blocks for $4.7k. He took that cash and hired a PR firm. Then things got wild. By New Years Eve 2006, $999k worth of pixels had been sold.\n\nAs the site attracted more visitors, the pixels became more valuable. Alex capitalized on the buzz by auctioning off the last 1000 pixels on eBay for $38k, bringing his total haul to just over $1MM. \n\nThe site still lives today. \n\nIf you zoom into the image on the top right, you’ll find the words: “own a piece of Internet history”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NiZZJVOMbsftMiigNapnE.png?height=1234&width=1600)\n\nBut here’s the thing, the early pixel buyers and fans of the project weren’t able to freely trade the pixels and share in the financial upside of the project. To call this an experiment in digital ownership is laughable by today’s standards, where tokenization and crypto-economic protocols are making it possible to make the Internet truly ownable.\n\nAn NFT equivalent of the Million Dollar Homepage would presumably introduce a new business model with shared upside for pixel owners, and perpetual royalties for the creator baked into the code itself. \n\nGenius? Not so much.

You decide where to place it. But you must commit to keeping it on your site.\n* The billboard is broken down into 48 lots, each represented by an NFT.\n* Invite your community to invest in and buy lots. Buying a lot entitles the owner to upload media and link out to a URL of their choice. They can resell the lot anytime. Websites get a % of the sale of any future lots in the secondary market, in perpetuity. \n\n**For the lotholders (aka the people buying the NFT lots):**\n\n* We are launching with billboards for three early startups that we believe will be seeing an increasing amount of traffic over time: Startupy, Koodos, and Coinvise. \n* Bid on or buy billboard lots from any of these websites. A grid lot is represented as an NFT, which grants you the ability to upload media and URL of your choice to your lot.\n* You can keep your lot indefinitely, or sell it anytime. Chances are, as the participating websites become more valuable and generate more traffic, your lot will be worth more. \n\n### What’s in it…\n\n**For the lotholders:**\n\n* Align yourself with the startups you believe in and get provable, verifiable ownership of that support. \n* Make $ by owning a valuable piece of digital real estate: In the physical real estate world, it is well known that value is driven by location. The same logic applies in the digital world, but thus far there have been few ways to monetize and invest in valuable digital real estate. The companies in the collective are at the forefront of their fields, and buying a grid lot is like betting early on them.\n* Simple, self-serve advertising: Online advertising has become overrun by “middleman” ad exchanges, audience segmentation, complicated behavioral and cross-device user tracking, and opaque cross-party sharing through data management platforms. We bring back simplicity. If you think one of the companies in The Modern Billboard Collective aligns with your brand, buy a lot and promote your company/project in it.  \n* Passive, community broadcasting: Buying a lot on a billboard doesn’t simply attach your value to that of the company—you also form an alliance with your lot neighbors. It’s a mutually profitable status play: you’re aligning yourself with both the sites you believe in, as well as the people who believe in those sites. \n\n**For startups in the collective:**\n\n* A new source of funding that does not involve giving up your freedom or diluting your cap table. Companies monetize from initial NFT sales and by collecting royalties every time the NFTs are resold.\n* A simple, non-intrusive ad product.\n* A fun experiment that aligns your community with your success.\n* An opportunity to participate in a collective of companies that are jointly vested in each other’s success. 5% of all initial lot sales will go towards the collective of participating companies. The pool provides a long-term hedge on the overall performance of each individual company billboard.\n\n### Will this perform well as an advertising format?\n\nThe short answer is – we don’t know! Maybe the square lots won’t get many clicks, but maybe the opposite will happen. Some of our working hypotheses:\n\n* The Modern Billboard combines the latest crypto technology with the oldest form of advertising as actual space separate from integration with your activities online, so the project itself may become an art piece that will draw attention that then draws attention to the lots.\n* The web currency of CPMs was built on commoditized, generalized metrics that treat all audience as equal. The Modern Billboard inverts that formula by acknowledging that not all audiences are created equal. In that sense, scanning through the billboard feels more akin to navigating a community directory (by choice) than getting served ads in a Twitter or Instagram feed (with no agency). It’s a fun and transparent way to see who is supporting or aligning with a startup, and discover relevant projects, companies, and people.\n* Online advertising has become overrun by “middleman” ad exchanges, programmatic ads, and complicated user tracking. This format brings back simplicity. It acknowledges that treating people with respect is the best way to earn their attention.\n\nLastly, we want the format to perform well and are committed to exploring and evolving the format to make it more performant (and human) than the status quo. Early supporters will be remembered and rewarded.\n\n### Can I buy a gridlot and rent out the ad space to someone else?\n\nOnce you buy the lot, it’s yours and you can do whatever you want with it (within the bounds of the hosting sites’ terms & conditions). In the future, we will add native tools to allow lotholders to rent out their lot space for a limited time. \n\n### I want to host a billboard on my website, how can I join the collective?\n\nTo ensure the quality of companies in the collective, participation is limited but you can apply to join the collective [here](https://airtable.com/shr1b3aRVFCCesPxh).\n\n### Hmmm…why crypto though?\n\nTokenization is perfect for this use case because combined with other financial building blocks on Ethereum, they allow anyone to own and trade their gridlots in a way that is borderless and easy to transfer. In addition, NFTs enable seamless, perpetual royalties - companies monetize by collecting royalties every time the NFTs are resold, an entirely new revenue stream that is only possible because of cryptoeconomic protocols that can encode royalty logic in the media itself.\n\nHow can I browse and bid on available lots?\n\nThe first billboards are set to be released next week. \n\n**[Get notified when we launch.](https://airtable.com/shrQbP4UOfnSYpRlS) If you want pre-release access, RT this Twitter thread🤝**\n\n### Who’s behind this?\n\n[Sari](https://twitter.com/sariazout), [Jad](https://twitter.com/Jad_AE), [Jenil](https://twitter.com/0xjenil), [Kirill](https://twitter.com/noskovvkirill), [Eliot](https://twitter.com/CDTEliot), [Gabriel](https://twitter.com/wacko_gabriel), [Aleena](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleenavigoda/), [Brandon](https://twitter.com/brandonbaraban), [Max](https://twitter.com/coffeein2code), Jeremiah & [Josh](https://twitter.com/joshnissenboim)", "timestamp": 1635980420, "digest": "f5rGPFSdOQxFlp-xR_ERP8m4YE6oPJ0JuK1gffI3DSQ", "contributor": "0x8cCBf346E4D3623aFBE2278b43a267D39854D147"}

Each pixel gave its owner the right to add a logo and link out to a website to drive traffic.\n\nIt took Alex two weeks to convince friends and family to purchase the first 47 blocks for $4.7k. He took that cash and hired a PR firm. Then things got wild. By New Years Eve 2006, $999k worth of pixels had been sold.\n\nAs the site attracted more visitors, the pixels became more valuable. Alex capitalized on the buzz by auctioning off the last 1000 pixels on eBay for $38k, bringing his total haul to just over $1MM.\n\nThe site still lives today.\n\nIf you zoom into the image on the top right, you’ll find the words: “own a piece of Internet history”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NiZZJVOMbsftMiigNapnE.png?height=1234&width=1600)\n\nBut here’s the thing, the early pixel buyers and fans of the project weren’t able to freely trade the pixels and share in the financial upside of the project. To call this an experiment in digital ownership is laughable by today’s standards, where tokenization and crypto-economic protocols are making it possible to make the Internet truly ownable.\n\nAn NFT equivalent of the Million Dollar Homepage would presumably introduce a new business model with shared upside for pixel owners, and perpetual royalties for the creator baked into the code itself.\n\nGenius?

{"id": "z-jexKRk4eqRD0s8ixVdNUbNrI8tK-IRm80_M1GJlIU", "title": "NFT的三大协议", "body": "发展到现在，大多数非同质化代币都是在以太坊区块链上创建的，主要形成了以下三种标准:\n\n•ERC-721——最早的标准，每一种代币都需要一个单独的智能合约。\n\n•ERC-1155——由 Enjin 公司的团队首创，提出了 NFT 的半同质化方案。ERC-1155 允许一个智能合约处理几种类型的代币，例如，这种合约可以同时包含同质化和非同质化代币，大大提升交易效率。\n\n•ERC-998——新的不断发展的标准，允许创建“可合成”的代币，及“拥有”另一数字资产的数字资产。这是对 ERC-721 标准的扩展，使 ERC-721 代币能够拥有其他 ERC-721 代币和 ERC-20 代币。例如，在电脑游戏中一个游戏角色的所有权代表一个非同质化代币，而角色装备的所有权代表另一个代币。ERC-998 允许用户将二者合成为一个代币。\n\n注：除了 Ethereum之外，NEO、EOS、TRON、FLOW、Binance 和 COSMOS 区块链上也有 NFT 标准。\nNFT 的标准化至关重要，特别体现在互操作性上，标准化使得这种不可流通的代币能在不同的 Dapp 之间流转。此外，由于区块链和以太坊生态系统的发展，流动性的问题得到了解决。交易市场（如Rarible 或 Sorare）则解决了销售和购买问题。\n\nFT 和 NFT 的一大区别在于使用了不同的合约接口，前者使用的代币协议为 ERC-20，后者为 ERC-721。\nERC-20\nERC-20 协议是以太坊区块链较早的、比较流行的代币规格协议。若以太坊平台上两种代币都以 ERC-20 发行，则两者之间可以进行自由置换。ERC20 是标准代币接口，规定了其基本功能, 方便第三方使用。系统开源使得 ERC20 的标准已经简单到可以 5 分钟发行一个 ERC-20 代币。ERC-20 代币听命于同一组代币合约的命令，也就意味着所有 ERC-20 协议中的代币都可轻松实现转移、请求、批准等功能，但其功能因此也具有局限性。\n\nERC-721\nNFT 项目通常使用 ERC-721 标准来签发 NFT。ERC-721 与 ERC-20 具有相似的属性。两者相似之处在于数字资产信息保存在同一个区块链上，关键区别在于，ERC-721 允许跟踪资产的所有权记录，这些资产都具有独一无二的特点。\n相比于 ERC-20，ERC-721 协议功能更多且技术更先进。该协议是以太坊的针对不可置换代币的 NFT 数字资产的第一个标准，应用于 CryptoKitties、Decentraland 等项目。ERC721 标准正是由 CryptoKitties 的 CTO Dieter Shirley 所创建和发布的，Dieter Shirley 是 NFT 的奠基人之一。\n虽然 ERC-721 较 ERC-20 用例较少，功能还处于探索之用，但 ERC-721 协议下的资产——画作、债券、房子或是汽车——的优势在于能保证所有权的安全性、所有权转移的便捷性以及所有权历史的不可更改性和透明性。另外，ERC721 还可以促进追踪、交易和管理真实资产的交易和管理等等。随着游戏虚拟资产不断流行起来，5G 和 VR 不断普及，搭载区块链技术，721 协议前景一片光明。\n\nERC-1155\n\n1. 什么是 ERC-1155？\n   与 ERC-20 和其他标准相比，ERC-1155 代币协议标准突出的地方在于它是如何跨链兼容的。到目前为止，用户的大部分资产只能在以太坊区块链上使用，然而 ERC-1155 标准也使其资产与其他生态系统兼容，能够跨多个区块链进行操作似乎是唯一的出路。\n2. ERC-1155 如何运作?\n   ERC-1155 使用本地的 Enjin 币来支持这些定制代币，可以确保通过此方法创建的所有资产都有一个保证值，该价值可以通过使用 Enjin 钱包内的本地“熔融”特性来获得，使得有形价值的获取更加直接。\n   ERC-1155 与传统的代币非常不同，不能直接销毁。相反，除非最初的开发人员定期买回代币，否则它们通常仍在流通。ERC-1155 的定位为更具体的代币标准，因为在此标准上任何资产都可以在任何给定时间创建和销毁。\n   由此带来的好处就是代币稀缺性。ERC-20 协议中，几乎不存在稀缺性。而 ERC-1155 协议下，资产的销毁可以减少流通量，改善整体的稀缺性，提供了与传统选择不一样的代币协议种类。", "timestamp": 1635982778, "digest": "dT3BKSaH0DmBmnsWLsTsyK2fJ50k53HwEqViotju1SM", "contributor": "0x04bc5eDE3c58fC2EAbC38De17FfC7cdaEE17C64E"}

{"id": "UWCfAs0dD9GiQI6ZVmTb4O6UlQo3h4w6N79w4n8ASU8", "title": "Tutorial: How to Provide Liquidity on Trader Joe — Mirror — Mirror", "body": "## What is Trader Joe?\n\n[Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/home) is an AMM style decentralized exchange on Avalanche. Trader Joe combines DEX services with DeFi lending to offer leveraged trading. Trader Joe’s products are community driven which allows them to allocate fees collected from liquidation and trades back to the users via the JOE/xJOE staking mechanism. JOE is a governance token that also rewards its holders with a share of exchange revenues.\n\n## What is Avalanche?\n\n[Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/) is a [layer one](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) blockchain created to host all kind of distributed applications. As another blockchain with similar utility to Ethereum, Avalanche has made small changes to how the blockchain works to optimize for speed and scalability. Avalanche aims to not only be a short term compliment to Ethereum but possibly even a substitute. Avalanche has a unique architecture. It consists of three unique chains: X-Chain, C-Chain and P-Chain. With each chain having its own purpose. Something interesting about Avalanche is that each chain uses a different consensus mechanism.\n\n## What is an AMM/CFMM?\n\nConstant Function Market Makers (CFMMs) are a classification of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) which have been applied to crypto DeFi markets. CFMMs were pioneered by several projects in the crypto community to create decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for digital asset trading and based on a mathematical function establishing a pre-defined set of prices based on the assets held in a liquidity pool. Whereas a centralized limit order book-based exchanges (OBs/CLOBs), traders trade against a specific counter-party.\n\n## Why Deposit Liquidity in Trader Joe?\n\nSome investors/traders may want to Provide Liquidity (LP) in an AMM style DEX for various reasons. One popular reason is the ability to earn rewards in the native governance token of the platform. This reward structure can be used to offset a concept known as [impermanent loss (IL)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/impermanent-loss) which is when someone’s assets in a pool lose relative value when the price of one asset changes dramatically against the other asset. The concept of earning tokens for staking LP tokens is referred to as [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-yield-farming) and can be done under the “Farm” tab on [Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/farm).\n\n## A step-by-step guide on how to lend assets on Trader Joe:\n\n* Visit [https://traderjoexyz.com](https://traderjoexyz.com/) and connect your wallet.\n\n![Trader Joe Connect Wallet Pop Up](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FefB_GbeDHGtEh7AgCYgGX.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n* If your wallet is not on the Avalanche Network, a window will prompt you to switch to the network. Click on “Switch to Avalanche” and sign it with your wallet.\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FANdLwi85qg1fFm_tZGl4D.png&w=2048&q=90)\n\n* Verify the chain data is correct and click approve.\n\n![Avalanche C-Chain Details](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FvcixdEM2zE6ZswaHGVZad.png&w=1920&q=90)\n\n![Switch Network to Avalanche C-Chain](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FOuxa0pH0h8Yl0wl_D35wC.png&w=1920&q=90)\n\n* Once you’ve switched to the Avalanche Network, you will see your wallet address up in the top right corner of the page.\n* Now you will head over to the “Pool” tab where you can pick a pool to deposit to.\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fq4-Pb_FT1Bbnla9XOtEVY.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n* In this example I selected the “AVAX-USDT.e” pool as seen in the picture below.\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FX2__-6iGxvbMaXwkfjhZc.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n* Depending on the amount of each token in the wallet, manually choose an amount of one token and the website will fill in the matching amount for the other token. Tip: You can use the “MAX” button for the coin with the smaller dollar value.\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FZGu8xkIJwZpsOp7GXNmzE.png&w=1920&q=90)\n\n* When you have decided the amount of each asset you would like to deposit as liquidity, you will click on the button underneath to deposit.\n* The transaction will take a few seconds to go through and once you get a confirmation screen, you can be assured your assets are now deposited into the pool of your choice!\n\n  ## Resources:\n\n  **Avalanche C-Chain Block Explorer:**\n\n  <https://cchain.explorer.avax.network/>\n\n  **Ethereum -→ Avalanche Bridge:**\n\n  <https://bridge.avax.network/login>", "timestamp": 1635984281, "digest": "D76UCshwcxd-Qa-fT5PiKo-0YStw3U6WzZOcGiID5ao", "contributor": "0x3eC44A823E07555B5f889d8d954eec736eb5865b"}

Wood的主题演讲，原标题《Substrate的要点分享》。\n\n笔记根据讲者英文视频和AI翻译进行简单的翻译与整理，因行走本人英文水平有限，会有信息遗落和错误，请知悉。\n\n以下，Enjoy：\n\n大家好，我是林嘉文，很高兴和大家分享关于Substrate的一些信息。\n\n首先我希望为大家介绍一下Substrate和其他竞争的区块链解决方案之间的不同。相比其他的一些去中心化的应用和去中心化的解决方案，Substrate有四点不同，理解这四点不同是非常很重要的：Unstoppable、Upgradable、Unlimited、Feeless（点对点、可升级、无限、无感）\n\n**1、Unstoppable 点对点的去中心化******\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211103/fe4efa49a53346aa81a10c840759cb9d_HAZDQKRTGM2A.jpeg) \n\n基于Substrate的平行链，是真正的点对点的，完全去中心化的。这个目前市面上大多数所谓领先的解决方案是有着前差万别的。很多所谓的解决方案，更多倾向于在中心化和去中心化之间做混合。这样的解决方案会使得网络中某一部分的参与者相比于其他人，获得更大的优势和权威。这样的解决方案本身就并非是P2P点对点的。这一方面会影响到网络整体的安全性，另一方面，技术是否能真正进行下去也要画个问号。\n\n但Substrate出现了，我们是真正的去中心化。我们网络中的每一个节点所拥有的数据都是一样的，并且在网络中所有的验证人能够获得的许可也是一致的。如果你并不想运行一个全节点，Substrate也提供了独一无二的功能，就是我们的轻客户端。轻客户端允许用户投入比较低的资源，从而实现对去中心化应用的访问。比如去访问Substrate的网络浏览器和移动端设备。\n\n2、**Upgradable 可升级******\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211103/b11a85704ae0445a9aa59b55c0ab7afd_GUYTQKRTGI2A.jpeg)\\\n\n\nSubstrate的可升级是具备可开发性和长期可持续性的关键要素。对于大家而言，很容易会认为某些软件的最初版本就是完美无缺的，也就是说它并不需要进一步的迭代、修改。不过这种想法完全不切合实际，而且是完全不会实现的。在现实世界中，软件需要在完整的生命周期中不断的升级。\n\n想要实现这一点，区块链的去中心化系统就需要有一个所谓的原协议。原协议代表了一个能够处理业务逻辑的区块链协议。它实际上是搭载在共识层的协议之上的。只有通过这样的方式，Substrate才能够允许我们的开发人员对各类企业级的应用程序进行升级，而且在升级中需要付出的努力是最小的。\n\n3、**Unlimited无限性******\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211103/3808525833694fcdbdfb6273cd5d9d98\\_GUZDEKRTGE4Q.jpeg)\\\n\n\nSubstrate的无限性体现在，用户在使用去中心化技术和区块链的场景是无限的。Substrate是无准入的开放式网络，这和事务性的模型存在这天壤之别。作为一个开发者，你可以自行决定去运行哪些代码以及何时去跑这些代码。项目也不需要和其他项目竞争，以执行想要执行的事务性逻辑。Substrate允许你对时间进行切分，决定到底要运行哪些逻辑。可以指定哪些机构和个人可以来进行使用。\n\n另外，我们也允许链上的调度，允许交易和事务优先的方式，同时允许对交易进行定制，允许无费用的交易。总体来说，那些那些传统的智能合约环境中已经不被允许和最初的想象，这些API接口在Substrate上都可以实现接入。\n\n4、**Feeless 无感******\n\nSubstrate能够给作为平行链开发作者提供经济上的自由。平行链的开发者可以决定以何种方式，何时接入Substrate。同时这个决策也是平行链上的用户来决定的。有更多的用户支持你的平行链，愿意为插槽拍卖进行质押，开发者就可以获得平行链资源。这和传统互联网早期时代有些类似。可以有效的避免某些平台的限制。\n\n这些平台会决定或者限制用户的访问，会要求用户持有平台的代币才能使用区块链网络。有了Substrate和Substrate的执行模型作应用，平行链可以自行决定到底是使用代币还是使用其他方式。身份认证是采用链上的方式，还是链下一些身份识别的服务。以及其他平行链可以想到的，用来决定一个用户是否可以使用网络，使用的频率多高以及何时使用。\n\n在理论上，开发者可以避免过多的成本投入，就像在Web 2时代一样获得一个很好的冷启动的过程。而不需要为了使用某个组件、插件而单独付费。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211103/8d4e74862e434739a93fb728408f9f9b_HAZDQKRUGA3Q.jpeg)\\\n\n\n以上就是Substrate的四大显著区别，我认为大家有必要对其有一个清晰的认识，从而能够理解我们为什么要开发Substrate，以及Substrate到底能提供怎样的优势。\n\n下面我会和大家分享一下Substrate生态中一些项目的进展。\n\n1、**Bridges Status 跨链桥******\n\n如果大家之前有了解过跨链技术会知道，在链和链之间的通信是分开的，而跨链为使其连接，提供了一个低安全性的，相互通信的系统。它允许独立的链之间进行通信。虽然大家有必要意识到，其中的哪个链安全性最低，它将主导和其他链之间总体交互的安全性。这意味着，对于高安全性的链而言，通过跨链桥的方式和其他链进行桥接是存在很大的安全隐患的。\n\nBridges Status跨链桥可以实现独立的链之间的互操作性和互通性。我们目前正在进行跨链桥的两个测试版本的调试，代码的第二轮审计，还有两周就可以正式完成。我们预计它的完整代码会很快确定下来。虽然可能会有一些修正，但不会是很多。这样我们就可以在Kusama和波卡两个价值网络中实现中继对中继的跨链。\n\n这样的规划，我们预计到今年年底前就能实现。因此对于这两个网络而言，前景也是非常令人兴奋的。\n\n而且我们预计在明年的一月、二月的时候，就能实现在Kusama和波卡网络中的平行链之间的跨链桥。\n\n**2、XCM Status******\n\n这会是XCM信息传递机制的第二个版本，它带来的一系列的优化。包括可扩展的虚拟机模型，就是我们所谓的跨共识的虚拟机XCM。如果大家对于这个虚拟机的技术底层有兴趣，可以去Github上看。我们有一个专门的XCM格式的Github库。\n\nStatus这个新版本提供了很多功能，其中就包括自动化的版本追踪。通过这个功能的实现，两个不同版本的XCM，不同的列就能够实现互操作性和相互通信。但却并不需要同步进行升级。\n\n与此同时，我们也引入了异步错误处理程序。比如一条链上的信息出现了问题，但另一条链上的代码依然可以对它进行修改。\n\n我们还有 一个新的优化，是关于资产锁定，资产赎回合作的消息。这样就可以避免在插槽竞拍结束后，或者有意，或者无意被落下的资产，可以在稍后进行赎回。\n\n我个人还是希望那些宝贵的资产不会无意被丢失或者被销毁。XCM也从最底层引入了一个异常处理机制。可以允许不同的代码运行，无论是否存在错误。\n\n**3、Parachains Status******\n\n我们非常高兴和大家告知，目前我们的平行链和平行链代码库已经是功能完整的了。这就意味着平行链已经具备了必要的安全性，代码审计也已经完成。当然在平行链及其代码被正式投入到使用之前，还会有一些非常重要的修正，但我们预计在并不遥远的未来就会完成。我们是希望其在几天之内就可以完成。我们预计最晚平行链的代码会在11月上旬被首先部署在Kusama的网络里，而在未来的一到两周就能够实现在Kusama网络的部署。这会进一步的强化我们的信心。\n\n不过从生产角度而言，从技术上说，最好不要在12月或12月中旬我们完成代码测试之前来使用这个代码。\n\n下面想和各位分享一下我对行业未来几年的展望，以及我到底是如何看待行业发展变化的：\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211103/33cc2d3fb8a9415aaa237b13222231ce_HAZDQKRTHAYA.jpeg) \n\n在我们的行业中，存在这许多的驱动力量。其中之一就是对高性能的渴求。比如我们一直希望更高的TPS，更高的吞吐量。但我认为**有一些团队在追求高性能的时候已经忘记了一个事实：去中心化和安全并不是一个可选项**。**我们不能在安全性和去中心化这两个方面去寻找捷径。******\n\n对Parity来讲，我们没有忘记这一点。因此我们将加倍努力来确保我们的网络始终是去中心化的，同时是最大程度的点对点的网络。能够在技术允许的最大限度内做到去中心化和点对点。\n\n最近我们也能看到，行业在监管方面出现了一些新的趋势。比如有些国家出台了一些政策性的文件供我们阅读。这些文件中有一点非常明确，软件开发并不是监管明确要干预的领域。从我读到的文件和理解看，这一点让我非常高兴。软件开发依然得到了很好的保护。一般来说，通用型的网络维护和通用性的代码运维都是可以正常进行的。当然不同国家的情况还是存在差异的。\n\n由于监管的加强，有一些趋势从长期而言是不可持续的。而大多数情况下，这些不可持续的趋势都是和中心化要素相关的。比如RPC服务商、OTC的服务商，可能以后在线上会越来越少的被看到。\n\n此外， 托管钱包和DAPP的应用网站或商城，如果其背后有一个中心化的服务器（平台、运营方），我认为它都会是被监管的对象和目标。\n\n包括一些多签钱包，基于Substrate的多签钱包也有可能被监管关注。也包括了一些托管服务。一般来说，托管服务商会包含钱包、非去中心化的稳定币。这些项目可能会面临一些困境。\n\n还有一些我认为是半中心化的应用，虽然使用了高度个性化的技术，但也存在一些中心化的技术要素。它们需要这些中心化的技术要素来增加用户规模，吸引用户的关注。我认为这些中心化的运营流程，也会受到监管的关注并面临困境。\n\n有一点非常清晰，**如果一个项目的中心化程度越高，意味着监管越有可能会详细的审视这个项目到底在做什么**。就像是监管哪些银行活动一样，要求你取得国际上的一些许可和证书。\n\n与之相对的，如果你能够实现去中心化，更多的P2P，而且能够确保所有的参与者都是可以公平的参与，没有人能够获得特权。这样拥有最大程度开放性特征的应用，相对来说面临的监管和许可要求可能会更小一些。\n\n虽然我们要关注去中心化，同时也需要重点的关注安全。当然可扩展性是这一切中最重要的因素。对于行业内的项目来说，监管要求往往会更针对一些被认为是非常中心化的项目。也许我们还需要一年、两年或者三年才能看到监管对于中心化项目的实质性行动，但如果我们放眼长远，很多项目确实应该从现在就做出改变。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211103/d096d894d92e4addb6dc2a629db158e0\\_HAZDQKRTHE2A.jpeg) \n\nParity和Substrate会将所有的时间聚焦于去中心化，在基础设施层面就实现去中心化和点对点的网络。我们会确保基于Kusama和波卡网络，跑在链上的应用能够在长期实现可持续性。这意味着我们还需要在一些其他领域去实现去中心化，也需要持续的创新。\n\n幸运的是，我们已经在这条道路上取得了一些进展。第一点是在治理层面，尤其是在对于Substrate的治理上需要找到一些其他的替代方案。比如目前的理事会制度，本质上属于一个多重签名，有大量的控制在其中，并不是一个绝对的去中心化的设计。所以当我们的网络变得非常大的时候，理事会的机制也是需要重新思考的。\n\n其次是我们会通过轻客户端去解决RPC服务商的问题。其实对于任何一个所谓的去中心化网络而言，RPC服务商都是一个非常明显的卡脖子的点（使用了中心化互联网企业提供的云服务—行走注）。当然去中心化的存储也需要进一步的创新，以确保其高性能，使得去中心化之后，用户的体验是一致的。我们会做一系列的创新，使得轻客户端。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211103/ccfcef29ed7744d3a86a5b77576fee49\\_HAZDQKRTGY4A.jpeg)\\\n\n\n依赖已经存在的，比较安全的系统。这一点也是我们要在未来一、两个月投入努力的方向。技术上的创新还包括了很多，比如在节点之间实现交互的同时，如何保持彼此的隐私，当然这样做的目的是实现更大的安全性。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211103/ed0944b9b9874f4f9c5bb90d592412db_GUZTQKRTGQYA.jpeg)\\\n\n\n总之，我们确实是一个去中心化的网络**。Substrate提供的方案将会是高性能的，基于Web 3级别安全性的，而且是真正P2P的。波卡正在构建世界上首个或者说首批P2P的，高安全性，高可扩展性，高可执行的网络平台**。我也希望这样构建起来的平台，在未来几年对您而言是有好处的。\n\n以上是笔记的全部内容。\n\n根据央行等部门发布“关于进一步防范和处置虚拟货币交易炒作风险的通知”，请读者严格遵守所在地区法律法规，不参与任何违法违规的投资行为。本文内容仅用于信息分享，不对任何经营与投资活动推广进行背书，请读者提高风险防范意识。\n",

What if you could fund your startup while aligning your community with your upside?\n\nA group of Internet friends came together to reflect on these questions. The result was[ The Modern Billboard Collective](https://themodernbillboard.com/) – a collective of startups selling ad space on their website represented as NFTs that are freely tradable.

Each pixel gave its owner the right to add a logo and link out to a website to drive traffic.\n\nIt took Alex two weeks to convince friends and family to purchase the first 47 blocks for $4.7k. He took that cash and hired a PR firm. Then things got wild. By New Years Eve 2006, $999k worth of pixels had been sold.\n\nAs the site attracted more visitors, the pixels became more valuable. Alex capitalized on the buzz by auctioning off the last 1000 pixels on eBay for $38k, bringing his total haul to just over $1MM.\n\nThe site still lives today.\n\nIf you zoom into the image on the top right, you’ll find the words: “own a piece of Internet history”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NiZZJVOMbsftMiigNapnE.png?height=1234&width=1600)\n\nBut here’s the thing, the early pixel buyers and fans of the project weren’t able to freely trade the pixels and share in the financial upside of the project. To call this an experiment in digital ownership is laughable by today’s standards, where tokenization and crypto-economic protocols are making it possible to make the Internet truly ownable.\n\nAn NFT equivalent of the Million Dollar Homepage would presumably introduce a new business model with shared upside for pixel owners, and perpetual royalties for the creator baked into the code itself.\n\nGenius? Not so much. [Many have tried](https://milliondollartokenpage.com/) and failed.\n\nIt’s hard to replicate the viral success of the Million Dollar Homepage.\n\nBut zooming out, the key insight from the Million Dollar Homepage is that digital real estate can be very valuable. So why start a website for the sole purpose of selling *pixels* on the lottery chance that it succeeds when we could apply the same logic to existing digital real estate?\n\nIn the physical real estate business, it is well known that value is driven primarily by one thing: location, location, location!\n\nThe same logic should apply to digital spaces - domain squatting, anyone? Owning shares in a startup has proven to be a huge source of wealth creation - but most people can’t invest in startups, either due to lack of access or not being accredited investors.\n\nAnd most startups thus far have had to trade money for freedom, defaulting to raising venture funding even though the tool of venture capital is appropriate for a tiny, tiny fraction of companies.\n\nWe think there should be more ways for founders to fund their companies while aligning their community to participate in its upside.\n\n**[The Modern Billboard Collective](https://themodernbillboard.com/) is a group of startups selling ad space on their websites - represented as NFTs on a billboard - that are freely tradeable. If you believe a website in the collective will succeed and generate more traffic over time, you can buy a little piece of it now and resell it in the future. Chances are, as the participating websites become more valuable, your lot will be worth more.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LPEC5qV1Pkos9mVhrtgBb.png?height=4096&width=6740&&&size=medium)\n\nAd products typically only work once you have millions of eyeballs. But tokenization introduces a new dynamic. By combining the benefits of a billboard ad with the appreciation potential of an NFT, we are giving lotholders a unique way to support the companies they believe in, advertise their own projects, and retain significant upside potential.\n\nIt’s the benefits of advertising, the upside of an investment, and the feel good vibes of patronage ;)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/viqSeyC8yMDReiTzyr9fq.png?height=1346&width=2966&&&size=medium)\n\n**Ugh, but like I have a million questions.**\n\n*Let’s unpack them.*\n\n### How exactly does this work?\n\n**For startups in the collective (aka websites hosting a billboard):**\n\n* Add a billboard to your site. You decide where to place it. But you must commit to keeping it on your site.\n* The billboard is broken down into 48 lots, each represented by an NFT.\n* Invite your community to invest in and buy lots. Buying a lot entitles the owner to upload media and link out to a URL of their choice. They can resell the lot anytime. Websites get a % of the sale of any future lots in the secondary market, in perpetuity.\n\n**For the lotholders (aka the people buying the NFT lots):**\n\n* We are launching with billboards for three early startups that we believe will be seeing an increasing amount of traffic over time: Startupy, Koodos, and Coinvise.\n* Bid on or buy billboard lots from any of these websites. A grid lot is represented as an NFT, which grants you the ability to upload media and URL of your choice to your lot.\n* You can keep your lot indefinitely, or sell it anytime. Chances are, as the participating websites become more valuable and generate more traffic, your lot will be worth more.\n\n### What’s in it…\n\n**For the lotholders:**\n\n* Align yourself with the startups you believe in and get provable, verifiable ownership of that support.\n* Make $ by owning a valuable piece of digital real estate: In the physical real estate world, it is well known that value is driven by location. The same logic applies in the digital world, but thus far there have been few ways to monetize and invest in valuable digital real estate. The companies in the collective are at the forefront of their fields, and buying a grid lot is like betting early on them.\n* Simple, self-serve advertising: Online advertising has become overrun by “middleman” ad exchanges, audience segmentation, complicated behavioral and cross-device user tracking, and opaque cross-party sharing through data management platforms. We bring back simplicity. If you think one of the companies in The Modern Billboard Collective aligns with your brand, buy a lot and promote your company/project in it.\n* Passive, community broadcasting: Buying a lot on a billboard doesn’t simply attach your value to that of the company—you also form an alliance with your lot neighbors. It’s a mutually profitable status play: you’re aligning yourself with both the sites you believe in, as well as the people who believe in those sites.\n\n**For startups in the collective:**\n\n* A new source of funding that does not involve giving up your freedom or diluting your cap table. Companies monetize from initial NFT sales and by collecting royalties every time the NFTs are resold.\n* A simple, non-intrusive ad product.\n* A fun experiment that aligns your community with your success.\n* An opportunity to participate in a collective of companies that are jointly vested in each other’s success. 5% of all initial lot sales will go towards the collective of participating companies. The pool provides a long-term hedge on the overall performance of each individual company billboard.\n\n### Will this perform well as an advertising format?\n\nThe short answer is – we don’t know! Maybe the square lots won’t get many clicks, but maybe the opposite will happen. Some of our working hypotheses:\n\n* The Modern Billboard combines the latest crypto technology with the oldest form of advertising as actual space separate from integration with your activities online, so the project itself may become an art piece that will draw attention that then draws attention to the lots.\n* The web currency of CPMs was built on commoditized, generalized metrics that treat all audience as equal. The Modern Billboard inverts that formula by acknowledging that not all audiences are created equal. In that sense, scanning through the billboard feels more akin to navigating a community directory (by choice) than getting served ads in a Twitter or Instagram feed (with no agency). It’s a fun and transparent way to see who is supporting or aligning with a startup, and discover relevant projects, companies, and people.\n* Online advertising has become overrun by “middleman” ad exchanges, programmatic ads, and complicated user tracking. This format brings back simplicity. It acknowledges that treating people with respect is the best way to earn their attention.\n\nLastly, we want the format to perform well and are committed to exploring and evolving the format to make it more performant (and human) than the status quo. Early supporters will be remembered and rewarded.\n\n### Can I buy a gridlot and rent out the ad space to someone else?\n\nOnce you buy the lot, it’s yours and you can do whatever you want with it (within the bounds of the hosting sites’ terms & conditions). In the future, we will add native tools to allow lotholders to rent out their lot space for a limited time.\n\n### I want to host a billboard on my website, how can I join the collective?\n\nTo ensure the quality of companies in the collective, participation is limited but you can apply to join the collective [here](https://airtable.com/shr1b3aRVFCCesPxh).\n\n### Hmmm…why crypto though?\n\nTokenization is perfect for this use case because combined with other financial building blocks on Ethereum, they allow anyone to own and trade their gridlots in a way that is borderless and easy to transfer. In addition, NFTs enable seamless, perpetual royalties - companies monetize by collecting royalties every time the NFTs are resold, an entirely new revenue stream that is only possible because of cryptoeconomic protocols that can encode royalty logic in the media itself.\n\nHow can I browse and bid on available lots?\n\nThe first billboards are set to be released next week.\n\n**[Get notified when we launch.](https://airtable.com/shrQbP4UOfnSYpRlS) If you want pre-release access, RT this Twitter thread🤝**\n\n### Who’s behind this?\n\n[Sari](https://twitter.com/sariazout), [Jad](https://twitter.com/Jad_AE), [Jenil](https://twitter.com/0xjenil), [Kirill](https://twitter.com/noskovvkirill), [Eliot](https://twitter.com/CDTEliot), [Gabriel](https://twitter.com/wacko_gabriel), [Aleena](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleenavigoda/), [Brandon](https://twitter.com/brandonbaraban), [Max](https://twitter.com/coffeein2code), Jeremiah & [Josh](https://twitter.com/joshnissenboim)", "timestamp": 1635988113, "digest": "f5rGPFSdOQxFlp-xR_ERP8m4YE6oPJ0JuK1gffI3DSQ", "contributor": "0x8cCBf346E4D3623aFBE2278b43a267D39854D147"}

Alex capitalized on the buzz by auctioning off the last 1000 pixels on eBay for $38k, bringing his total haul to just over $1MM.\n\nThe site still lives today.\n\nIf you zoom into the image on the top right, you’ll find the words: “own a piece of Internet history”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NiZZJVOMbsftMiigNapnE.png?height=1234&width=1600)\n\nBut here’s the thing, the early pixel buyers and fans of the project weren’t able to freely trade the pixels and share in the financial upside of the project. To call this an experiment in digital ownership is laughable by today’s standards, where tokenization and crypto-economic protocols are making it possible to make the Internet truly ownable.\n\nAn NFT equivalent of the Million Dollar Homepage would presumably introduce a new business model with shared upside for pixel owners, and perpetual royalties for the creator baked into the code itself.\n\nGenius? Not so much. [Many have tried](https://milliondollartokenpage.com/) and failed.\n\nIt’s hard to replicate the viral success of the Million Dollar Homepage.\n\nBut zooming out, the key insight from the Million Dollar Homepage is that digital real estate can be very valuable. So why start a website for the sole purpose of selling *pixels* on the lottery chance that it succeeds when we could apply the same logic to existing digital real estate?\n\nIn the physical real estate business, it is well known that value is driven primarily based on location, location, location! Invest in a thriving neighborhood and reap the upside.\n\nThe same logic applies in digital spaces - domain squatting, anyone? Owning shares in a startup has proven to be a huge source of wealth creation - but [most people don’t have the opportunity to invest in startups](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1445791810496851971?s=20). Additionally, most startups thus far have had to trade money for freedom, defaulting to raising venture funding.\n\nWe think there should be more ways for founders to fund their companies while aligning their community to participate in its upside.\n\n**[The Modern Billboard Collective](https://themodernbillboard.com/) is a group of startups selling ad space on their websites - represented as NFTs on a billboard - that are freely tradeable. If you believe a website in the collective will succeed and generate more traffic over time, you can buy a little piece of it now and resell it in the future. Chances are, as the participating websites become more valuable, your lot will be worth more.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LPEC5qV1Pkos9mVhrtgBb.png?height=4096&width=6740&&&&size=medium)\n\nAd products typically only work once you have millions of eyeballs. But tokenization introduces a new dynamic. By combining the benefits of a billboard ad with the appreciation potential of an NFT, we are giving lotholders a unique way to support the companies they believe in, advertise their own projects, and retain significant upside potential.\n\nIt’s the benefits of advertising, the upside of an investment, and the feel good vibes of patronage ;)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/viqSeyC8yMDReiTzyr9fq.png?height=1346&width=2966&&&&size=medium)\n\n**Ugh, but like I have a million questions.**\n\n*Let’s unpack them.*\n\n### How exactly does this work?\n\n**For startups in the collective (aka websites hosting a billboard):**\n\n* Add a billboard to your site. You decide where to place it. But you must commit to keeping it on your site.\n* The billboard is broken down into 48 lots, each represented by an NFT.\n* Invite your community to invest in and buy lots. Buying a lot entitles the owner to upload media and link out to a URL of their choice. They can resell the lot anytime. Websites get a % of the sale of any future lots in the secondary market, in perpetuity.\n\n**For the lotholders (aka the people buying the NFT lots):**\n\n* We are launching with billboards for three early startups that we believe will be seeing an increasing amount of traffic over time: Startupy, Koodos, and Coinvise.\n* Bid on or buy billboard lots from any of these websites. A grid lot is represented as an NFT, which grants you the ability to upload media and URL of your choice to your lot.\n* You can keep your lot indefinitely, or sell it anytime. Chances are, as the participating websites become more valuable and generate more traffic, your lot will be worth more.\n\n### What’s in it…\n\n**For the lotholders:**\n\n* Align yourself with the startups you believe in and get provable, verifiable ownership of that support.\n* Make $ by owning a valuable piece of digital real estate: In the physical real estate world, it is well known that value is driven by location. The same logic applies in the digital world, but thus far there have been few ways to monetize and invest in valuable digital real estate. The companies in the collective are at the forefront of their fields, and buying a grid lot is like betting early on them.\n* Simple, self-serve advertising: Online advertising has become overrun by “middleman” ad exchanges, audience segmentation, complicated behavioral and cross-device user tracking, and opaque cross-party sharing through data management platforms. We bring back simplicity. If you think one of the companies in The Modern Billboard Collective aligns with your brand, buy a lot and promote your company/project in it.\n* Passive, community broadcasting: Buying a lot on a billboard doesn’t simply attach your value to that of the company—you also form an alliance with your lot neighbors. It’s a mutually profitable status play: you’re aligning yourself with both the sites you believe in, as well as the people who believe in those sites.\n\n**For startups in the collective:**\n\n* A new source of funding that does not involve giving up your freedom or diluting your cap table. Companies monetize from initial NFT sales and by collecting royalties every time the NFTs are resold.\n* A simple, non-intrusive ad product.\n* A fun experiment that aligns your community with your success.\n* An opportunity to participate in a collective of companies that are jointly vested in each other’s success. 5% of all initial lot sales will go towards the collective of participating companies. The pool provides a long-term hedge on the overall performance of each individual company billboard.\n\n### Will this perform well as an advertising format?\n\nThe short answer is – we don’t know! Maybe the square lots won’t get many clicks, but maybe the opposite will happen. Some of our working hypotheses:\n\n* The Modern Billboard combines the latest crypto technology with the oldest form of advertising as actual space separate from integration with your activities online, so the project itself may become an art piece that will draw attention that then draws attention to the lots.\n* The web currency of CPMs was built on commoditized, generalized metrics that treat all audience as equal. The Modern Billboard inverts that formula by acknowledging that not all audiences are created equal. In that sense, scanning through the billboard feels more akin to navigating a community directory (by choice) than getting served ads in a Twitter or Instagram feed (with no agency). It’s a fun and transparent way to see who is supporting or aligning with a startup, and discover relevant projects, companies, and people.\n* Online advertising has become overrun by “middleman” ad exchanges, programmatic ads, and complicated user tracking. This format brings back simplicity. It acknowledges that treating people with respect is the best way to earn their attention.\n\nLastly, we want the format to perform well and are committed to exploring and evolving the format to make it more performant (and human) than the status quo. Early supporters will be remembered and rewarded.\n\n### Can I buy a gridlot and rent out the ad space to someone else?\n\nOnce you buy the lot, it’s yours and you can do whatever you want with it (within the bounds of the hosting sites’ terms & conditions). In the future, we will add native tools to allow lotholders to rent out their lot space for a limited time.\n\n### I want to host a billboard on my website, how can I join the collective?\n\nTo ensure the quality of companies in the collective, participation is limited but you can apply to join the collective [here](https://airtable.com/shr1b3aRVFCCesPxh).\n\n### Hmmm…why crypto though?\n\nTokenization is perfect for this use case because combined with other financial building blocks on Ethereum, they allow anyone to own and trade their gridlots in a way that is borderless and easy to transfer. In addition, NFTs enable seamless, perpetual royalties - companies monetize by collecting royalties every time the NFTs are resold, an entirely new revenue stream that is only possible because of cryptoeconomic protocols that can encode royalty logic in the media itself.\n\nHow can I browse and bid on available lots?\n\nThe first billboards are set to be released next week.\n\n**[Get notified when we launch.](https://airtable.com/shrQbP4UOfnSYpRlS) If you want pre-release access, RT this Twitter thread🤝**\n\n### Who’s behind this?\n\n[Sari](https://twitter.com/sariazout), [Jad](https://twitter.com/Jad_AE), [Jenil](https://twitter.com/0xjenil), [Kirill](https://twitter.com/noskovvkirill), [Eliot](https://twitter.com/CDTEliot), [Gabriel](https://twitter.com/wacko_gabriel), [Aleena](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleenavigoda/), [Brandon](https://twitter.com/brandonbaraban), [Max](https://twitter.com/coffeein2code), Jeremiah & [Josh](https://twitter.com/joshnissenboim)", "timestamp": 1635988709, "digest": "f5rGPFSdOQxFlp-xR_ERP8m4YE6oPJ0JuK1gffI3DSQ", "contributor": "0x8cCBf346E4D3623aFBE2278b43a267D39854D147"}

ETH has shined so far this quarter because after setting an all-time high (ATH) of $4,400 recently, it [soared](https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/ether-scales-4600-record-high-bitcoin-trails-2021-11-03/) to new historic highs of $4,650. \n\nSix years ago, Ethereum [hit](https://twitter.com/EarnWithSapna/status/1454032505166651397) an all-time low of $0.4209 on October 21, 2015. Even though ETH has retraced to the $4,563 level during intraday trading, the second-largest cryptocurrency continues to scale the heights and showcase what the crypto space has to offer.\n\nFor instance, Ethereum has accelerated the penetration of booming sectors like decentralized finance (***[DeFi](https://blockchain.news/tag/DeFi)***) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) based on the high adoption rates of some features like smart contracts.\n\nThe percent of ETH supply in smart contracts recently [broke](https://blockchain.news/analysis/ethereum-supply-in-smart-contracts-hits-ath-of-28-percent) the record at 28%. \n\nSmart contracts are self-executing agreements based on blockchain technology that decreases the demand for centralized intermediates.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum Futures ETF has been witnessing simultaneous growth.

The launch is a springboard for crypto to become a more mainstream financial sector.\n\nBullish comments from tech billionaire investor trader Paul Tudor Jones also gave a boost to BTC price as he said crypto is a better inflation hedge than gold.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, Thiel joked that “you’re supposed to just buy bitcoin” prior to adding “I feel like I’ve been under-invested in it.” He echoed the views of several other billionaires, including Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Tesla CEO Elon Musk who expressed support for Bitcoin.\n\n* BTC price performance chart by TradingView\n\nWith the first BTC futures ETF debuting on the NYSE on Tuesday, Bitcoin notched a fresh all-time high of $66,974 on Wednesday, breaking through its previous record high of $64,888. Last week, BTC price rose by 12.2% to post its highest weekly close at $61,511.0.\n\nAccording to a survey of Finder's panel of 50 fintech experts, Bitcoin is expected to peak slightly above $80,000 this quarter, prior to closing the year near $71,400. The long-term predictions look even more radiant: panelists forecast BTC to skyrocket to $249,578 and $5,237,082 in 2025 and 2030, respectively.\n\nBased on the strong fundamentals and a favorable macro environment, I would say that BTC is likely aimed at $70,000, with a further potential pullback. It would be no surprise to see the minimum level of $72,000-$80,000 by the end of 2021. Still, the market is highly volatile.\n\nBitcoin price reacts most strongly to reports on its regulation. For example, if Switzerland finally makes BTC part of its constitution, we can expect even $100,000 by the end of the year. We need to monitor what happens closely.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum followed Bitcoin’s rally, rising above the psychological threshold of $4,000 to its new ATH of $4,366.09. The bullish trend is expected to continue. At the time of writing, ETH traded at $4,125.28 with a $487.42 billion market capitalization.\n\nLooking at technicals, ETH support level is seen at $3,599, while resistance is at $4,277.\n\n\\*ETH price performance chart by TradingView\n\nOther Crypto Gainers:\nSolana (SOL)\nSolana burst onto the scene in 2021, rising from a 0.01% market share to become one of the top 10 cryptos by market cap in September.

For any individual investor, the safety of their funds is all the most important. Choosing a reliable broker is of high importance if you want to trade and feel your investments are in safe hands.\n\n[Exness Broker](https://www.exness.com/) can provide safety for your investments. But what options can you have to ensure high profit from your investments?\n\nHere we offer you a closer look at the safest and most profitable investment options you can opt for to ensure the highest returns in 2021.\n\n**Investing in gold**\n\nGold is a truly unique asset. Mainly because it carries no counterparty risk. If you wish to invest in gold, you can do so through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), purchasing stock in gold miners and associated companies, or buying a solid product.\n\nGold is known to provide competitive returns compared to other assets. What makes gold a perfect investment is that ***[fiat currencies](https://blockchain.news/tag/fiat-currencies)*** tend to fall in value against gold. The latest analysis shows that investors holding between 2% to 10% of their funds in gold can significantly improve long-term performance.\n\n \n\n**Investing in stocks**\n\nImagine you invest by purchasing tiny fractional ownership pieces (shares) in a public company. Doing so, you're literally making a bet that a particular company develops and performs well over time. And if you make a wise choice of a company you decide to invest in and it does grow well, the stocks you hold will become more valuable, making them more desirable to other stock investors who will have to pay more for them than you once did. You can find more info about what is happening in stock markets by reading [FXStreet news](https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/whats-happening-in-markets-stocks-forex-bonds-commodities-video-202107150923).\n\nHere are the most profitable stock sectors you should check out now:\n\n**E-commerce**\n\nThe ongoing pandemic has led to a surge in online shopping. Many consumers who have never purchased anything on the Internet suddenly found themselves ordering groceries, clothing, and even large household appliances online. Moreover, many admire the convenience of online shopping and might not go back. With that said, e-commerce is booming and will likely continue to do so.\n\n**Health Care**\n\nWith most pharmaceutical manufacturers currently focusing mainly on COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, there are plenty of smaller medical companies, which are also growing at a staggering rate.\n\n**Travel**\n\nThe pandemic has hugely impacted the travel industry. However, the stock prices of travel companies are lower than ever before, making it probably the best time to invest before the shares skyrocket once again.\n\n**Green Energy**\n\nRenewable energy can provide us with an infinite source of non-polluting power. Needless to say, companies focused on green energy options are doing overwhelmingly well today.\n\n \n\n**Investing in government bonds**\n\nInvestments in government bonds are among the safest investments you can make as the state's credit backs the bonds. Government bonds are also highly liquid, although their value fluctuates depending on such risk factors as interest rate or inflation.\n\n**Investing in corporate bonds**\n\nCorporate bonds can be of particular interest to investors such as retirees looking for a stable cash flow or just anyone who wants a higher yield than government bond funds can provide. The best part is that you can buy or sell your fund shares at any time. You can also reinvest income or make additional investments if needed. Make sure to stick with respectable, blue-chip companies to be on the safe side with your funds.\n\n**Investing in real estate**\n\nReal estate makes an excellent investment, especially if you choose to self-manage your properties. For instance, if you purchase a few innovative (smart) properties in good locations, you will make easy passive income as tenants will fight over renting your apartment.\n\nWhile beneficial from many angles, real estate can also prove complicated to offload in case if you need to quickly raise money, as you can't instantly sell your properties with a few clicks on your phone.", "timestamp": 1635989425, "digest": "gE9YRXApSr7e-7b9YphSkxS4eWCZ2jgoI1L_OTvAOl4", "contributor": "0x08C9a8cc7430a9819Ab8d1A28CFA006E74864885"}

In addition lots of emails, documents and communication implied.\n\nError correction and waiting takes a huge amount of time, many processes are difficult to manage fast and to synchronize with each other. This number of documents affects the cost and time required to prepare, verify, transfer and sign them. Paper documents are often associated with fraud and forgery. In addition, COVID-19 has impacted various stages of financial trade, including business meetings, negotiations, document transfers, personal signatures and shipments.\n\nEverything is going in favor of using blockchain in financial trading. And this is another consequence of the pandemic: it provoked an increase in digitalization in all areas, including trade.\n\nBlockchain Technology allows people to trade at a lower cost and with speeds much faster than before.\n\n**Trade Cryptocurrency with MetaTrader 5  - What is MetaTrader Used for?**\n\nExness MetaTrader is a popular online trading platform that you can use to automate your trading.

Everyone should test additional features to boost his or her trading experience.\n\n**What Does Trade Finance Mean?**\n\nTrade finance means financing for trade and refers to both domestic and international trade transactions. A trade requires a seller, a buyer, and various intermediaries, such as banks and financial institutions that facilitate these transactions by financing trade.\n\nThe foundation of trade finance platforms is blockchain. There are many advantages, especially compared to the traditional model of doing business in this area.\n\n**What Is Blockchain?**\n\n \n \n\nBlockchain is the latest technology, the interest in which has grown along with the popularity of cryptocurrencies. Initially, blockchain technology appeared to put ***[bitcoin](https://blockchain.news/tag/bitcoin)*** into circulation and was used exceptionally to manage cryptocurrencies. However, since its emergence in 2009, the area of its application has expanded considerably. Today it is widely discussed and used in the world of finance, marketing, computer games, as well as to store and process personal data and identification. \n\nLiterally, blockchain is a continuous chain of blocks. It is a technology that helps users to store the entire chain of transactions and the current list of owners on their computers. Furthermore, if one or more computers fail, the information will not be lost. Blockchain can be considered the source of truth, because transaction information cannot be hidden, changed or falsified. The status of the transaction is instantly updated and stored after every action done. As a result, it is almost impossible to lose information irrevocably.\n\nBlockchain platforms provide rapid access to partner companies around the world and take communication between all participants to the new level. In addition to a common communication environment, platforms provide new opportunities for fast document flow. A process that used to take weeks can now be reduced to a minimum of one or two days.\n\nAll indications are that transactions using trade finance tools over blockchain platforms will eventually become the global standard. The reality is that small platforms are leaving the market, while large platforms are investing, growing, and attracting more participants. In the future, the largest participants will be interconnected with each other. As a result, whoever joins them will have access to a huge number of counterparties from around the world. Eventually, the traditional model will disappear completely. After all, if everyone has gone digital and one company hasn't done it, it will be left out in the cold. Even if their offerings are profitable, no one will notice them. \n\n**Blockchain: How It Works?**\n\nWe've collected the main concepts of blockchain and in simple words will help you to understand how this technology works.\n\nFirst of all, we need an **asset**. It is usually something of value (money, property, information). Assets can exist in the real world as well as they can be completely digital.\n\nWhen people transfer assets to each other, it is called a **transaction**. The mechanism for confirming the transfer of an asset or rights to an asset is very secure and confidential. In blockchain, the registry of owners is not stored on a single organization's server. Its copies are simultaneously updated on several independent computers. \n\nA **block** is a record in a distributed registry of several transactions. It reflects who, to whom, and when transferred a certain amount of assets. All blocks are sequentially connected in one consecutive chain. Blocks cannot be changed or deleted; only new blocks can be added. In this way, it is always possible to reconstruct the transition history and to know its current owner.\n\n**Miners** store copies of the blockchain, protect information from loss or tampering, confirm and verify transactions that other miners have registered. Everyone can become a miner. Just specialized computers and software needed. Miners get **rewards** for their work. Usually these are commissions from all participants in transactions and rewards from the network itself. The network generates this reward according to a certain algorithm.\n\nTransactors and miners receive transfers on their **digital wallets**. A digital wallet keeps the entire history of a particular user's transactions. Most often such wallets are anonymous. They do not allow finding out who accepts or sends assets from it. \n\nIn blockchain networks, the buyer and seller confirm the transaction with a cryptographic **key** – a unique digital code. It is almost impossible to guess the sequence of characters of a code. \n\nThe benefits of using blockchain include the low cost of money transfers, the reduction of intermediaries such as banks, and the possibility of electronic identification. Blockchain technology has been identified as one of the ways to combat corruption.\n\nIn commerce, it is safe to say that blockchain will be useful for confirming transactions occurring remotely, verifying the authenticity of transactions, controlling the supply chain etz.. Blockchain technology makes all processes transparent. All things considered, we have a few highlights that demonstrate the benefits of blockchain in trade finance:\n\n●    Efficiency\n\n●    Traceability\n\n●    Auditability\n\n●    Transparency\n\n●    Security\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n**10 trading influencers you should follow in 2021**\n\n[Following trading influencers](https://tradingbeasts.com/featured/cryptocurrency-quotes/) will help you to learn as much as possible about the powerful potential of blockchain technology.   \n\n●   Elon Musk \n\n●   Nick Szabo\n\n●   Andreas Antonopoulos\n\n●   Adam Back\n\n●   Nick Szabo\n\n●   Josh Olszewicz\n\n●   WhalePanda\n\n●   Lil Bubble\n\n●   Altcoin Sara\n\n●   Changpeng Zhao\n\n●   Nicholas Merten\n\n●   Vitalik Buterin\n\n●   Roger Ver\n\n**Bottom Line** \n\nThe main idea of blockchain technology is to decentralize the storage of data that is usually owned, controlled or manipulated by a central entity in a traditional scheme. Trade finance experts argue that moving to paperless trade would be extremely helpful by reducing costs, error-free documentation, transparency and rapid transfer of documents to customers.  New technology contributes to the efficiency of the trade finance process.", "timestamp": 1635989254, "digest": "Uor9oJjz_tLgkVlcggequWw8zR3GxdUwrAKTqjCpjhw", "contributor": "0xbaA8670A19f0ea64187837eE6C4841fF4D392357"}

{"id": "u8uQlJZkDrpvWpzPEqdru3hCAkbjFZ93f-2CAurR_vo", "title": "Benefits and Use cases of Blockchain in Real Estate Sector", "body": "Without a doubt, technological innovations and advancements are reshaping the dimensions of the globe in which we are currently living. In the last few decades, great strides were made from physical payments to digital payments, from cash to cards, and from desktop to mobile.\n\nCryptocurrency and blockchain technology appears to be the next major leap in that evolution.  \n\nThe enormous asset class of the world is real estate. Real estate professionals and commercial enterprises recognise the revolutionary impact of blockchain technology to streamline payments and optimise commercial and retail property sales. Not only this, blockchain technology plays a pivotal role in increasing access to real estate funds and investment opportunities. From the rental market to general real estate transactions, cryptocurrency and blockchain technology can transform the way landlords and tenants do their business.   \n\nLet’s dig into the benefits, use cases, and implementation of blockchain technology in real estate.  \n\n**How Blockchain Technology proves to be beneficial for the Real Estate Industry?** \n\nCommercial real property consists of a notable portion of transaction pursuit and international economic assets. According to a Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) report, the overall size of the professionally managed global real estate investment market evolved from $7.4 trillion to $8.5 trillion from 2016 to 2017, respectively.  The real property market of the current era consists of several independent and isolated networks with blurriness and transactional resistance between current systems.  \n\nBlockchain technology provides the following  benefits to the real estate industry: \n\n* Blockchain technology provides effortless access to secondary market opportunities. \n* It brings forth access to broad investor pools because of ownership fractionalisation.\n* Blockchain technology gives accessibility to global asset distribution.\n* Automated processes help in reducing costs.\n* Blockchain technology provides process efficiency for underlying industry operations.\n* It permits the securitisation and tokenisation of real property assets. \n\nBlockchain technology allows data accessibility which is crucial to make better investment decisions, enhance transparency and portfolio management.\n\nApart from this, digital securitisation of real estate properties is one of the most existing ways blockchain technology benefits the real estate industry. Ideally, as a landlord or tenant,  that may necessarily want a groundbreaking solution to send and receive cryptocurrency payments in real-time privately, conveniently, securely while streamlining market verticals across the board. \n\n**Use Cases of Blockchain Technology in Real Property**\n\nEnterprise blockchain technology modifies the real estate industry with the following ten use cases: \n\n* Urban planning \n* Project financing\n* instantaneous accounting\n* Management of property\n* Leasing and payments\n* Identity verification and KYC of Inventor and tenant\n* Loan and mortgage tokenisation or securitisation\n* Construction and development of property\n* Real property investments and asset management\n* Sales, registries, and reassignment of properties and lands\n\n**Influence of Blockchain Technology on Estate Management**\n\nLarge-scale estate management organisations go through incompetent oversights of their universal profiles and holdings. Thanks to blockchain technology as it streamlines rental payments and collections. It facilitates data sharing and makes the life of landlords easy. Blockchain technology also provides premium due diligence across the portfolio. This allows cost and time savings. Moreover, it enhances operational efficiency and generates sustainably richer data. That data facilitates making critical strategic decisions. \n\n**Influence of Blockchain Technology on Leasing and Payments**\n\nDistributed ledger technology allows leases to be signed as well as paid on-chain in real-time. This automates dividend and rental payments to property owners and eliminates the need for manual reconciliations. Also, smart contracts help in the automatisation of different types of remittances and fees. This stimulates the appropriate behaviour of tenants, landlords, and service providers. \n\n**Influence of Blockchain Technology on Real-Time Accounting** \n\nAsset owners and investors benefit from near-intermediate and automated accounting as cash flows and property ownership is recorded on-chain. The preparation of annual financial statements, including statements of cash flows, income statement, or balance sheet, will be conducted in the upcoming years with the potential for real-time audits. It enables several breakthroughs in investor relations, regulatory oversight, and compliance. \n\n**Influence of Blockchain on Urban Planning**  \n\nProperty development usually encounters the absence of valuable input from the community. The public feels disenfranchised because the local communities don’t express their preferences during the planning process. Blockchain-based planning platforms include feedback loops between stakeholders, educational resources, and token-based participation incentives. This integrates local communities in the property development value chain, encourages community engagement, and improves developer services for sustainable success. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nObviously, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are still in the early stages of development. Several industries and investors are curious about what this revolutionary technology has more to serve this world in approaching years. The real estate market is already facing a significant impact of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in the form of smart contracts, tokenisation, and verification. Moreover, it has provided new opportunities for the sale of property and acquisition for real estate investors. \n\nKnowledge, expertise, skills, and advice of real estate professionals are important to commercial buyers in the real property market. However, accounting, document processing, liability management, and processing of securities will inevitably transform. Hence, it’s only time to tell us which improvements and advancements of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are the lasting ones. ", "timestamp": 1635989504, "digest": "JIa-V2RTsuzSPzZBndwFW2GZAn6GFmezN1x791ZAJZQ", "contributor": "0xB5141ebEF9A4789cb3fCC6b393feF28657Ce2E3A"}

Right from healthcare to finance and banking, many industries, sectors, and businesses can immensely benefit by integrating Blockchain technology into their daily processes.\n\nThis article discusses Blockchain’s potential to transform the web hosting industry for the better- both for providers and end clients.\n\nA website can be considered as a digital equivalent of your brick and mortar shop or workplace. Through your website, you earn revenue, make business connections, attract global clients- individuals and institutional buyers, and make sales.\n\nTo build and run a website, you need to buy a domain name and hosting services. While you have control over your site’s front-end, its backend is deeply influenced and shaped by your hosting ecosystem. You trust your providers with the security of your website, but an increasing amount of data breaches and cyberattacks tell a different story. We cannot blame it entirely on the hosting providers. It is the present “model” of web hosting that needs serious revamping.\n\nAmong other solutions, Blockchain can be a highly effective option that should be considered. Being decentralised and secured by cryptographic hashes, the Blockchain promises to add a new dimension to the website's security and performance. Here are a few ways Blockchain can be used in the hosting industry:\n\n**Preventing DDoS Attacks**\n\nDue to their more profound and quick impact, DDoS or [Distributed Denial of Services attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) has emerged as a preferred weapon for threat actors. It is an almost sure-shot way to bring websites to a complete standstill and disrupt the digital environment. It is all a play of volume- Gather volume and direct it against the servers of the targeted site. Bots make things even more accessible. To continue staying online, the victim has to exponentially increase the computing resources that cost millions of dollars for the hosting companies across the globe.\n\nOne thing to mention here is that it is the present system of centralised servers that makes DDoS attacks possible. With the help of Blockchain-based decentralised hosting with thousands of distributed nodes, every node can host a specific portion of the site. It effectively prevents the attacks as there isn’t any single central target to hit.\n\n**Prevention of DNS-manipulation**\n\nThe DNS server translates the plain English name in users' browser address bar into a computer language- technically called IP address to connect the visitors with the corresponding website they want to browse.\n\nThe attackers can upset the digital environment by disrupting this critical process of converting URLs into IP addresses. Such attacks can be massive in terms of both geographical and business terms.\n\nA reliable solution to prevent DNS attacks is to use the Blockchain platform for storage, resolving, and updating DNS records. This distributed model of DNS management will prevent the threat actors from directing their threat efforts towards a single DNS server. Moreover, it will also provide superior protection against various other attacks associated with DNS manipulation- like man-in-the-middle attacks and URL redirection to the malicious resources.\n\n**Complete data ownership**\n\nIn the present centralised digital ecosystem, we need to trust the sites with our sensitive data. This model has many flaws- that users have started discovering more recently. Lack of good security provisions at the providers’ end can result in heavy data breaches, and the stolen data can be misused by cyber-attackers in myriad ways- right from manipulating your sensitive digital areas to unlocking your passwords, misusing your communication IDs, and even wiping off your bank accounts with the help of payment card numbers.\n\nMoreover, even the providers use your data by selling them to other companies, which results in annoying market communications and requests for downloading specific apps. They can even mine your data to achieve their business goals. All these things happen without your permission.\n\nWith the help of a cryptographic system of Blockchain, you can now retain complete data ownership while using different digital applications. The blockchain model replaces centralised storage with distributed storage across a vast network. It empowers the users to enjoy exclusive data access while using digital applications.\n\n**Defending cyber-attacks with Blockchain-Cloud combination**\n\nUsing point-to-point encryption can play a vital role in protecting the mission-critical data from in-transit attacks and also protecting its integrity at the resting location. Point to point distribution facilitates the even spread of Blockchain copies across the broader breadth of cloud networks that provides substantially higher security against data breaches- especially when compared to existing single-point data storage.\n\nIt will also give a new dimension to encryption-based security as the mission-critical data can be shredded into minute portions before encrypting them. Furthermore, leveraging the decentralised characteristics of Blockchain technology, these tiny data portions can be stored on different nodes that are strategically distributed across several geographies. In short, it adds several other shields over the top of encryption-based technology to ensure superior security.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBlockchain runs as a decentralised platform that replaces the central authority with cryptographic hashes and smart contracts. It offers airtight security to the data and transaction while ensuring unrestricted access to the permitted data. By strategically employing Blockchain in the web hosting industry, the hosting providers can guarantee superior security and performance. At the same time, the end clients can enjoy quick and smooth functionality while retaining maximum control over their data.", "timestamp": 1635989603, "digest": "Sjrt5M5a5VicD7ioSdrt90dv05NMDPqYLlDrxP-uRTE", "contributor": "0x860b6dDdb221D7d184f63e59e2C0E9A63C542c39"}

But tokenization introduces a new dynamic. By combining the benefits of a billboard ad with the appreciation potential of an NFT, we are giving lotholders a unique way to support the companies they believe in, advertise their own projects, and retain significant upside potential.\n\nIt’s the benefits of advertising, the upside of an investment, and the feel good vibes of patronage ;)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/viqSeyC8yMDReiTzyr9fq.png?height=1346&width=2966&&&&&size=medium)\n\n**Ugh, but like I have a million questions.**\n\n*Let’s unpack them.*\n\n### How exactly does this work?\n\n**For startups in the collective (aka websites hosting a billboard):**\n\n* Add a billboard to your site. You decide where to place it. But you must commit to keeping it on your site.\n* The billboard is broken down into 48 lots, each represented by an NFT.\n* Invite your community to invest in and buy lots. Buying a lot entitles the owner to upload media and link out to a URL of their choice. They can resell the lot anytime. Websites get a % of the sale of any future lots in the secondary market, in perpetuity.\n\n**For the lotholders (aka the people buying the NFT lots):**\n\n* We are launching with billboards for three early startups that we believe will be seeing an increasing amount of traffic over time: Startupy, Koodos, and Coinvise.\n* Bid on or buy billboard lots from any of these websites. A grid lot is represented as an NFT, which grants you the ability to upload media and URL of your choice to your lot.\n* You can keep your lot indefinitely, or sell it anytime. Chances are, as the participating websites become more valuable and generate more traffic, your lot will be worth more.\n\n### What’s in it…\n\n**For the lotholders:**\n\n* Align yourself with the startups you believe in and get provable, verifiable ownership of that support.\n* Make $ by owning a valuable piece of digital real estate: In the physical real estate world, it is well known that value is driven by location. The same logic applies in the digital world, but thus far there have been few ways to monetize and invest in valuable digital real estate. The companies in the collective are at the forefront of their fields, and buying a grid lot is like betting early on them.\n* Simple, self-serve advertising: Online advertising has become overrun by “middleman” ad exchanges, audience segmentation, complicated behavioral and cross-device user tracking, and opaque cross-party sharing through data management platforms. We bring back simplicity. If you think one of the companies in The Modern Billboard Collective aligns with your brand, buy a lot and promote your company/project in it.\n* Passive, community broadcasting: Buying a lot on a billboard doesn’t simply attach your value to that of the company—you also form an alliance with your lot neighbors. It’s a mutually profitable status play: you’re aligning yourself with both the sites you believe in, as well as the people who believe in those sites.\n\n**For startups in the collective:**\n\n* A new source of funding that does not involve giving up your freedom or diluting your cap table. Companies monetize from initial NFT sales and by collecting royalties every time the NFTs are resold.\n* A simple, non-intrusive ad product.\n* A fun experiment that aligns your community with your success.\n* An opportunity to participate in a collective of companies that are jointly vested in each other’s success. 5% of all initial lot sales will go towards the collective of participating companies. The pool provides a long-term hedge on the overall performance of each individual company billboard.\n\n### Will this perform well as an advertising format?\n\nThe short answer is – we don’t know! Maybe the square lots won’t get many clicks, but maybe the opposite will happen. Some of our working hypotheses:\n\n* The Modern Billboard combines the latest crypto technology with the oldest form of advertising as actual space separate from integration with your activities online, so the project itself may become an art piece that will draw attention that then draws attention to the lots.\n* The web currency of CPMs was built on commoditized, generalized metrics that treat all audience as equal. The Modern Billboard inverts that formula by acknowledging that not all audiences are created equal. In that sense, scanning through the billboard feels more akin to navigating a community directory (by choice) than getting served ads in a Twitter or Instagram feed (with no agency). It’s a fun and transparent way to see who is supporting or aligning with a startup, and discover relevant projects, companies, and people.\n* Online advertising has become overrun by “middleman” ad exchanges, programmatic ads, and complicated user tracking. This format brings back simplicity. It acknowledges that treating people with respect is the best way to earn their attention.\n\nLastly, we want the format to perform well and are committed to exploring and evolving the format to make it more performant (and human) than the status quo. Early supporters will be remembered and rewarded.\n\n### Can I buy a gridlot and rent out the ad space to someone else?\n\nOnce you buy the lot, it’s yours and you can do whatever you want with it (within the bounds of the hosting sites’ terms & conditions). In the future, we will add native tools to allow lotholders to rent out their lot space for a limited time.\n\n### I want to host a billboard on my website, how can I join the collective?\n\nTo ensure the quality of companies in the collective, participation is limited but you can apply to join the collective [here](https://airtable.com/shr1b3aRVFCCesPxh).\n\n### Hmmm…why crypto though?\n\nTokenization is perfect for this use case because combined with other financial building blocks on Ethereum, they allow anyone to own and trade their gridlots in a way that is borderless and easy to transfer. In addition, NFTs enable seamless, perpetual royalties - companies monetize by collecting royalties every time the NFTs are resold, an entirely new revenue stream that is only possible because of cryptoeconomic protocols that can encode royalty logic in the media itself.\n\nHow can I browse and bid on available lots?\n\nThe first billboards are set to be released next week.\n\n**[Get notified when we launch.](https://airtable.com/shrQbP4UOfnSYpRlS) If you want pre-release access, RT this Twitter thread🤝**\n\n### Who’s behind this?\n\n[Sari](https://twitter.com/sariazout), [Jad](https://twitter.com/Jad_AE), [Jenil](https://twitter.com/0xjenil), [Kirill](https://twitter.com/noskovvkirill), [Eliot](https://twitter.com/CDTEliot), [Gabriel](https://twitter.com/wacko_gabriel), [Aleena](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleenavigoda/), [Brandon](https://twitter.com/brandonbaraban), [Max](https://twitter.com/coffeein2code), Jeremiah & [Josh](https://twitter.com/joshnissenboim)", "timestamp": 1635989982, "digest": "f5rGPFSdOQxFlp-xR_ERP8m4YE6oPJ0JuK1gffI3DSQ", "contributor": "0x8cCBf346E4D3623aFBE2278b43a267D39854D147"}

What if you could advertise on them? What if you could fund your startup while letting your community participate in the upside?\n\nA group of Internet friends came together to reflect on these questions. The result was[ The Modern Billboard Collective](https://themodernbillboard.com/) – a collective of startups selling ad space on their websites as NFTs. [Get notified when we launch. ](https://airtable.com/shrQbP4UOfnSYpRlS)Read for more 👇\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/u2jOBUAjrZEyJULCv1lrr.png?height=4096&width=6740&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n\n---\n\nThe initial spark came from the unlikeliest of places…the [Million Dollar Homepage](http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/).\n\nThe Million Dollar Homepage was created in 2005 by [Alex Tew](https://twitter.com/tewy) (now the founder of [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) 🤯). He sold one million pixels for $1 each to pay for school and each pixel gave its owner the right to add a logo and link out to a website to drive traffic.\n\nIt took Alex two weeks to convince friends and family to purchase the first 47 blocks for $4.7k. He took that cash and hired a PR firm. Then things got wild. By New Years Eve 2006, $999k worth of pixels had been sold.\n\nAs the site attracted more visitors, the pixels became more valuable. Alex capitalized on the buzz by auctioning off the last 1000 pixels on eBay for $38k, bringing his total haul to just over $1MM.\n\nThe site still lives today.\n\nIf you zoom into the image on the top right, you’ll find the words: “own a piece of Internet history”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NiZZJVOMbsftMiigNapnE.png?height=1234&width=1600)\n\nBut here’s the thing, the early pixel buyers and fans of the project weren’t able to freely trade the pixels and share in the financial upside of the project. To call this an experiment in digital ownership is laughable by today’s standards, where tokenization and crypto-economic protocols are making it possible to make the Internet truly ownable.\n\nAn NFT equivalent of the Million Dollar Homepage would presumably introduce a new business model with shared upside for pixel owners, and perpetual royalties for the creator baked into the code itself.\n\nGenius? Not so much. [Many have tried](https://milliondollartokenpage.com/) and failed.\n\nIt’s hard to replicate the viral success of the Million Dollar Homepage.\n\nBut zooming out, the key insight from the Million Dollar Homepage is that digital real estate can be very valuable. So why start a website for the sole purpose of selling *pixels* on the lottery chance that it succeeds when we could apply the same logic to existing digital real estate?\n\nIn the physical real estate business, it is well known that value is driven primarily based on location, location, location! Invest in a thriving neighborhood and reap the upside.\n\nThe same logic applies in digital spaces - and it’s more than just domain squatting. Buying ‘real estate’ on a startup’s website could be the equivalent of investing in a property in an up-and-coming neighborhood. \n\nOwning shares in a startup has proven to be a huge source of wealth creation - but [most people don’t have the opportunity to invest in startups](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1445791810496851971?s=20). Additionally, most startups thus far have had to trade money for freedom, defaulting to raising venture funding. Tokens have proven to be a lucrative alternative for founders to fund their companies while aligning their community to participate in the upside.\n\n**[The Modern Billboard Collective](https://themodernbillboard.com/) is a group of startups selling ad space on their websites - represented as NFTs on a billboard - that are freely tradeable. If you believe a website in the collective will succeed and generate more traffic over time, you can buy a little piece of it now and resell it in the future. Chances are, as the participating websites become more valuable, your lot will be worth more.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LPEC5qV1Pkos9mVhrtgBb.png?height=4096&width=6740&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nAd products typically only work once you have millions of eyeballs. But tokenization introduces a new dynamic. By combining the benefits of a billboard ad with the appreciation potential of an NFT, we are giving lot-holders a unique way to support the companies they believe in, advertise their own projects, and retain significant upside potential.\n\nIt’s the benefits of advertising, the upside of an investment, and the feel good vibes of patronage ;)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/viqSeyC8yMDReiTzyr9fq.png?height=1346&width=2966&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n**Ugh, but like I have a million questions.**\n\n*Let’s unpack them.*\n\n### How exactly does this work?\n\n**For startups in the collective (aka websites hosting a billboard):**\n\n* Add a billboard to your site. You decide where to place it. But you must commit to keeping it on your site.\n* The billboard is broken down into 48 lots, each represented by an NFT.\n* Invite your community to invest in and buy lots. Buying a lot entitles the owner to upload media and link out to a URL of their choice. They can resell the lot anytime. Websites get a % of the sale of any future lots in the secondary market, in perpetuity.\n\n**For the lotholders (aka the people buying the NFT lots):**\n\n* We are launching with billboards for three early startups that we believe will be seeing an increasing amount of traffic over time: Startupy, Koodos, and Coinvise.\n* Bid on or buy billboard lots from any of these websites. A grid lot is represented as an NFT, which grants you the ability to upload media and URL of your choice to your lot.\n* You can keep your lot indefinitely, or sell it anytime. Chances are, as the participating websites become more valuable and generate more traffic, your lot will be worth more.\n\n### What’s in it…\n\n**For the lotholders:**\n\n* Align yourself with the startups you believe in and get provable, verifiable ownership of that support.\n* Make $ by owning a valuable piece of digital real estate: In the physical real estate world, it is well known that value is driven by location. The same logic applies in the digital world, but thus far there have been few ways to monetize and invest in valuable digital real estate. The companies in the collective are at the forefront of their fields, and buying a grid lot is like betting early on them.\n* Simple, self-serve advertising: Online advertising has become overrun by “middleman” ad exchanges, audience segmentation, complicated behavioral and cross-device user tracking, and opaque cross-party sharing through data management platforms. We bring back simplicity. If you think one of the companies in The Modern Billboard Collective aligns with your brand, buy a lot and promote your company/project in it.\n* Passive, community broadcasting: Buying a lot on a billboard doesn’t simply attach your value to that of the company—you also form an alliance with your lot neighbors. It’s a mutually profitable status play: you’re aligning yourself with both the sites you believe in, as well as the people who believe in those sites.\n\n**For startups in the collective:**\n\n* A new source of funding that does not involve giving up your freedom or diluting your cap table. Companies monetize from initial NFT sales and by collecting royalties every time the NFTs are resold.\n* A simple, non-intrusive ad product.\n* A fun experiment that aligns your community with your success.\n* An opportunity to participate in a collective of companies that are jointly vested in each other’s success. 5% of all initial lot sales will go towards the collective of participating companies. The pool provides a long-term hedge on the overall performance of each individual company billboard.\n\n### Will this perform well as an advertising format?\n\nThe short answer is – we don’t know! Maybe the square lots won’t get many clicks, but maybe the opposite will happen. Some of our working hypotheses:\n\n* The Modern Billboard combines the latest crypto technology with the oldest form of advertising as actual space separate from integration with your activities online, so the project itself may become an art piece that will draw attention that then draws attention to the lots.\n* The web currency of CPMs was built on commoditized, generalized metrics that treat all audience as equal. The Modern Billboard inverts that formula by acknowledging that not all audiences are created equal. In that sense, scanning through the billboard feels more akin to navigating a community directory (by choice) than getting served ads in a Twitter or Instagram feed (with no agency). It’s a fun and transparent way to see who is supporting or aligning with a startup, and discover relevant projects, companies, and people.\n* Online advertising has become overrun by “middleman” ad exchanges, programmatic ads, and complicated user tracking. This format brings back simplicity. It acknowledges that treating people with respect is the best way to earn their attention.\n\nLastly, we want the format to perform well and are committed to exploring and evolving the format to make it more performant (and human) than the status quo. Early supporters will be remembered and rewarded.\n\n### Can I buy a gridlot and rent out the ad space to someone else?\n\nOnce you buy the lot, it’s yours and you can do whatever you want with it (within the bounds of the hosting sites’ terms & conditions). In the future, we will add native tools to allow lotholders to rent out their lot space for a limited time.\n\n### I want to host a billboard on my website, how can I join the collective?\n\nTo ensure the quality of companies in the collective, participation is limited but you can apply to join the collective [here](https://airtable.com/shr1b3aRVFCCesPxh).\n\n### Hmmm…why crypto though?\n\nTokenization is perfect for this use case because combined with other financial building blocks on Ethereum, they allow anyone to own and trade their gridlots in a way that is borderless and easy to transfer. In addition, NFTs enable seamless, perpetual royalties - companies monetize by collecting royalties every time the NFTs are resold, an entirely new revenue stream that is only possible because of cryptoeconomic protocols that can encode royalty logic in the media itself.\n\nHow can I browse and bid on available lots?\n\nThe first billboards are set to be released next week.\n\n**[Get notified when we launch.](https://airtable.com/shrQbP4UOfnSYpRlS) If you want pre-release access, RT this Twitter thread🤝**\n\n### Who’s behind this?\n\n[Sari](https://twitter.com/sariazout), [Jad](https://twitter.com/Jad_AE), [Jenil](https://twitter.com/0xjenil), [Kirill](https://twitter.com/noskovvkirill), [Eliot](https://twitter.com/CDTEliot), [Gabriel](https://twitter.com/wacko_gabriel), [Aleena](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleenavigoda/), [Brandon](https://twitter.com/brandonbaraban), [Max](https://twitter.com/coffeein2code), Jeremiah & [Josh](https://twitter.com/joshnissenboim)", "timestamp": 1635991271, "digest": "f5rGPFSdOQxFlp-xR_ERP8m4YE6oPJ0JuK1gffI3DSQ", "contributor": "0x8cCBf346E4D3623aFBE2278b43a267D39854D147"}

As groundbreaking governance and economic infrastructure emerge from the efforts of the pioneers of web3, DAOs are becoming strong cultural and economic forces with significant influence on all of our lives. Approaching is the age of DAOs governing the vast majority of real-world assets, their respective decentralized tokenization protocols & legal frameworks, and the open platforms curating their web3 presence. \n\nFrom the RED Brick Club web3 collective, with professional experience & vision in the following fields -  software & blockchain development, corporate law, political engineering, and design - comes the following DAO proposal. \n\nThis NFT sale represents the official launch of the Real Estate DAO ( @ RealEstateDAO ) - a decentralized autonomous organization governing a limited liability corporate framework with the purposes of funding & contributing to the development of a legally compliant tokenized real estate web3 stack including a decentralized application (dApp) with an open-source protocol, legal frameworks, and governance tools that aims to provide individuals, businesses, & organizations the means to tokenize and manage a variety of different real estate assets on the blockchain, including residential, commercial, social, and industrial real estate. \n\nUpon completion of the protocol and front-end application, the DAO **“Brick Club”** will manage and scale the first sufficiently scaled, multiple-sector, tokenized, community-owned & governed real estate portfolio via the token ($BRICK) that funds the protocol / dApp. Legal frameworks and DAO infrastructure will be designed in parallel. \n\nTo develop and scale such an endeavor, the collective is announcing the Real Estate DAO NFTs. **Buyers will be whitelisted for significant early $BRICK token distribution via airdrop.** The proceeds will be immediately locked into a multi-sig Gnosis Safe upon the termination of the NFT sale. \n\nThe RED Brick Club’s 2021 / early 2022 rough roadmap: \n\n1. A DAO LLC formation in Delaware, as well as an on or off-shore foundation (TBD).\n2. The launch of the $BRICK token on the Ethereum blockchain and appropriate ZKP-based layer 2 scaling solutions including on-chain governance (Arbitrum, ZKSync, Starknet, etc). \n3. The flexible, secure implementation of cutting-edge DAO infrastructure, including a Gnosis Safe multi-sig & Snapshot governance protocol, and a decentralized website on Arweave’s Permaweb with a relevant ENS domain & Mirror blog. \n\nThank you for your interest, and if you buy an NFT…\n\n🧱 **Welcome to the Real Estate DAO Brick Club.** \n\n*We will be launching a formal development roadmap (“The RED Brick Road”) very soon, as well a Permaweb page and community discord.

This means that you don’t have to spend too much when transferring money to others, and you don’t have to worry about the increased costs of shopping in certain businesses.\n```", "timestamp": 1635993233, "digest": "sAO5UiJFpITlRdRrc1PRQiuJN8uwyqbSLJKpYXc3kVw", "contributor": "0xAC06251490967736A557cA92a29482FfE04F7ebf"}

This reward structure can be used to offset a concept known as [impermanent loss (IL)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/impermanent-loss) which is when someone’s assets in a pool lose relative value when the price of one asset changes dramatically against the other asset. The concept of earning tokens for staking LP tokens is referred to as [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-yield-farming) and can be done under the “Farm” tab on [Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/farm).\n\n## A step-by-step guide on how to lend assets on Trader Joe:\n\n* Visit [https://traderjoexyz.com](https://traderjoexyz.com/) and connect your wallet.\n\n![Trader Joe Connect Wallet Pop Up](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FefB_GbeDHGtEh7AgCYgGX.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n* If your wallet is not on the Avalanche Network, a window will prompt you to switch to the network.

{"id": "jSbKXWitfEjPYEWMk4Vt8GAcIdQUyPW03LikoS8KKoQ", "title": "What are the advantages of SheepDex as Uniswap V3 on the BSC chain?", "body": "With the popularity of the cryptocurrency market and the tightening of global regulatory policies, DEX is expected to account for an increasing proportion of the entire cryptocurrency market trading platform. Uniswap is undoubtedly the track leader and innovator in the DEX market, and its daily trading volume is already comparable to that of the world's top CEX. Uniswap's rapid growth was boosted by the release of V3 in particular.\n\nWhat are the main features of Uniswap V3?\n\nIn Uniswap V3, the efficiency of capital use is significantly improved, up to 4,000 times, according to the official report. This is mainly due to the user's choice of price range. In addition to the price range, the user can choose the rate of market making. In addition, the version also achieved a single currency market and other functions.\n\nThe success of Uniswap V3 also provides an opportunity to optimize other DEX, such as SheepDex on the BSC chain, which is the first DEX other than Uniswap to implement V3.\n\nSheepDex: indicates the DEX that has Uniswap V3 enabled\n\nSheepDex ([sheepdex.org](http://sheepdex.org)) is a decentralized cross-chain liquidity aggregation platform for both cash and derivatives. It was the first DEX to co-exist both cash and derivatives. Participation in SheepDex provides liquidity mining and trading incentives, while allowing liquidity providers (LPs) to deploy funds within a price range within a trading pair to improve the efficiency of the use of funds, further focus trading depth and provide better liquidity to end users.\n\nSheepDex will support derivatives as well as cash trading, there will be leveraged tokens and in the future there will be perpetual contracts on the SheepDex platform with no funding fee, which will break the history of perpetual contracts having to pay a funding fee.\n\nSheepDex Reviews (Experience)\n\nBelow we mainly from trading and market - making these two aspects of experience.\n\nA) trading\n\nSheepDex supports inter-price market making, so users often choose a market range based on the market price (e.g. 10% fluctuation in the market price) because of higher capital utilization and more profit from market making. When more and more users choose market-making price ranges that fluctuate up and down based on market prices, it is equivalent to the range of orders in CEX that are based on market prices. Therefore, the trading depth will be greatly enhanced. The depth of trading has increased, and users can get more revenue when they trade. Let's do the SheepDex versus PancakeSwap.\n\nSheepDex is particularly advantageous when exchanging stablecoins.\n\n1, can exchange more tokens, less volatile loss\n\nFor example, if you exchange BUSD for USDT at both PancakeSwap and SheepDex, you get 990074USDT at PancakeSwap and 997599USDT at SheepDex, that is, You can obtain an additional 7525USDT at SheepDex.\n\nWe can also see from the transaction above that SheepDex has a lower PancakeSwap loss of 0.81% compared to -0.02% for PancakeSwap.\n\nIf you exchange BUSD for USDT on SheepDex, you get more USDT, and if you exchange BUSD for USDT on SheepDex, is there any advantage? We go on to the SheepDex and PancakeSwap.\n\nSheepDex $1 million USDT for 997788BUSD and PancakeSwap $1 million USDT for 988739BUSD, a difference of 9049BUSD, So you get 9049BUSD for PancakeSwap, and SheepDex has a much lower immutability loss than PancakeSwap.\n\nSheepDex Swap has lower fees\n\nAs you can see from the transaction screen above, SheepDex provides you with more tokens and a lower commission than PancakeSwap. For example, if you exchange BUSD for 1 million USDT, SheepDex has a working capital provider fee of 2,000USdt and PancakeSwap 2500USDT.\n\nSheepDex has a clear advantage over PancakeSwap Swap, both in terms of loss and cost.\n\n1. SheepDex Swap provides more information\n\nSheepDex therefore has a significant price advantage when converting stabecoins across the BSC chain. Let's look at the user experience for SheepDex Swap.\n\nYou can see that the Swap screen at SheepDex provides more transaction information, for example in the screenshot above of exchanging BNB for USDT, both the number of BNB entered and the number of USDT that can be exchanged, There will be a corresponding real-time dollar value (for example, the current market value of 2.188BNB is 1155.96 USD). The advantage of this design is that it is not easy to enter wrong information during the transaction. After entering the exchange quantity, there will be an estimated DOLLAR value, and users will have a value expectation in their mind.\n\nPancakeSwap does not have such value estimation information, for example, when entering 2.188bnb in the Swap interface of PancakeSwap, users may be confused about the current market value of 2.188BNb. The value estimate provided by SheepDex gives you a good idea.\n\nYou can also see the transaction rewards (i.e., trading rewards) directly on the SheepDex Swap screen as well as volatile losses, minimum exchanges, etc.\n\n1. make a market\n\nOne of the biggest features of SheepDex compared to other swaps is the ability to select price ranges for market making, which is a key feature of Uniswap V3. SheepDex implemented this function only a few months after Uniswap V3 launched. It also reflects the technical strength of the SheepDex team.\n\nAt present, most Swap exchanges in the market, when users make market, the price range is from 0 to infinity, that is, inter-regional price making, that is, whether the price of tokens plummets to 0 or spikes to infinity, users' market making funds support the exchange of corresponding tokens. Can, in fact, most of the tokens, price range is limited, especially in a relatively short time period with the price range is relatively narrow, provide full price range do city city certainly wasted money to use efficiency, while SheepDex points price range for city market funds use efficiency is improved greatly.\n\nSheepDex offers a default market - making price range when we have selected a market - making fund pair such as BNB-USDT. For example, in the figure above, SheepDex provides users with a range of BNB/USDT market making prices ranging from 50% down to 100% up, shown in blue, BNB is currently 518.907usdt, Therefore, the current market-making price range is:\n\n518\\.907 x (1-50%) \\~\\~\\~\\~\\~ 518.907 x (1+100%).\n\nIt says that the user's money will only make the market if the current BNB price falls within this range, and if it falls beyond this range (both down and up), the user's money will not make the market.\n\nOf course, this price range can be customized by the user. For example, in the figure above, the user can change the price range by sliding the corresponding percentage (up or down) button left and right.\n\nIn addition to swiping the left and right buttons, users can use the \"+\" and \"-\" buttons in the figure below to fine-tune the upper and lower limits of the price range, or directly enter the upper and lower limits of the price range.\n\nWhether through a sliding button, use the \"+\" \"-\" button to change the market price range, or by manually enter the market price of the upper and lower limits, these three methods are linked, also is to use any method to change the market price range, market-making interface in blue area, the lowest rate, the highest conversion rates will change the corresponding data.\n\nOn the SheepDex market making interface, you can choose between price ranges and use the full range function, which is the way most swaps are currently doing.\n\nIn addition, when the price range of the market is not within the current market price range of the currency, only one currency can be charged to provide liquidity, which is the so-called single currency market making.\n\nFor example, in the figure above, the price of BNB is 545USDT. If the market price range is 664 -- 901 USDT, then only BNB can be topped up to make the market. Similarly, if the market price range is lower than the current market price, then only USDT can be topped up.\n\nThe SheepDex market - making interface allows you to make a wide range of market - making options based on your actual situation.\n\nIn the market-making interface of the SheepDex platform, not only is the price range optional, but the fees are optional.\n\nSheepDex has three levels of fees: 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.5%, of which the lowest 0.1% is suitable for stable currency because it has the least volatility and carries less risk to the user, while 0.5% is suitable for currencies with low transaction volume. These currencies are relatively unfashionable and users are taking on more risk when making markets, so yields are correspondingly higher and 0.2% is appropriate for most currencies, which is the default for the SheepDex platform.\n\nNote: in the fee box, the selection percentage below refers to the user's selection rate. For example, in the figure above, the selection rate of the 0.2% fee is 100%, indicating that the current market making users of BNB/USDT are all opting for the 02% fee.\n\nFor example, in the USDT/USDC transaction pair, 52% chose 0.1%, while the remaining 48% chose 0.2%.\n\nAlthough SheepDex recommends a level of market-making fees for each coin, you can choose your own rates based on your situation.\n\nOverall, SheepDex, as a decentralized exchange with Uniswap V3 capabilities, has a significant advantage for both trading and mining on the platform.", "timestamp": 1635995694, "digest": "1Tg9OxJIOOXjwWwxzt26ikVFqm-Z7CeAoXrBBMNb33w", "contributor": "0x8767552e76C4C1D5982797cF514d0FeF373D602C"}

'Laughter is the language of the soul.' Efficient and timely. Especially since it cost 3 pages to write.\"`\n\n![Source: https://twitter.com/easusj/status/1453491163210698754?s=21](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p3BtyQ78tbyuK4WuJUY29.png?height=374&width=468)\n\n![Source: https://twitter.com/easusj/status/1453491163210698754?s=21](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NkNZqkMiKIrcq2RcEebOJ.png?height=450&width=468)\n\nLOST POETS的成功离不开Pak的设计、Elon Musk、Sotheby's的关注，而对于我们而言，更重要的或许是神秘莫测的诗人形象与那些文学要素、现代诗性、审美气质乃至哲学隐喻若有若无的关联。倘若它能像“Pablo Neruda”一样在冷下来的NFT市场中进入人们的日常生活，勾连起”超越生活“的诗歌与每一个NFT持有人个体生活的响应，不妨称它为一场NFT文艺运动。\n\n【Hashmasks】#NFT Collectibles\n\n![Source:https://www.thehashmasks.com/gallery](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ifYYgTMu_Hs_KpDPCa6fS.png?height=229&width=468)\n\n「LOST POETS」的命名机制及肖像盲盒早有先声——Hashmasks。Hashmasks是一个NFT数字艺术收藏品项目，由全球70多名艺术家创作，采用盲盒拍卖方式启动。\n\nHashmasks的系列NFT中，每个都有艺术家自身灌输的价值观和隐喻/暗含特征，并且都是独一无二的。整体来看，Hask与CryptoPunk的IP机制类似，但添加了冠名权和stake概念，让其具有了更多的价值捕获和沉淀手段。Hashmasks知名度较高，在此不作具体分析。Hashmasks后期发展可参考下图——“Hashmasks’ Expansion into the Metaverse via Virtual Worlds”。\n\n![Source:https://nftevening.com/hashmasks-nfts-to-colonise-four-different-digital-worlds/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oMlQY8qwXHzLc-wodM4Z8.png?height=365&width=468)\n\n【Cosmo Chamber】#NFT Art\n\n![Source:https://m.cosmochamber.art/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/12VHhedVpUZIbN5CdZVBE.png?height=225&width=468)\n\nCosmo Chamber是十月推出的NFT项目，通过以太坊ERC721协议发行6001枚不重复的「宇宙客厅」NFT。与LOST POETS相比，Cosmo Chamber的机制设计较为简单，但它的东方美学表达及诸多细节却是NFT市场的审美高标。\n\n根据项目op上的介绍，Cosmo Chamber是对Hashmask的一次致意，这是首个具有东方感性（Eastern sensibility）的NFT集合。创作「宇宙客厅」的四位艺术家都“Continuing a long lineage of interest in Eastern philosophies and the literati tradition”——对东方哲学和文士传统的志趣存在着绵延已久的谱系，而他们正是这一谱系的延续者。\n\nCosmo Chamber试图摒弃快餐式的NFT，为那些真正在意美学的群体带来一个独特的NFT元宇宙——一场东方视阈下的“奥德赛式”的美学空间跋涉。项目的灵感取自The Double Screen一书，表达出对时空宇宙的另一种体悟。\n\n![Source: https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/D/bo21520412.html](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SVgePv1ebvzxOHMK7QUFK.png?height=230&width=468)\n\n![（作为对该项目的补充介绍，我们从Discord中文区摘录了部分内容）Source:https://discord.gg/QpetW4XW\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bfwIbrevVQz0yUgmp7Q2R.png?height=150&width=468)\n\n如下图所示，我们从官网上截取了对四位艺术家的介绍。在社会学的视角下，Cosmo Chamber不仅是一个NFT collection，更是NFT创作者中一类新兴群体集中性的话语载体。\n\n以该项目为例，多元的文化知识背景：东方神秘主义、佛教思想、文身文化；艺术表达的历史感：明朝工笔画的承继；传统在现代数字技术中的复兴：古典风景画与计算机生成的3D景观的融合……如此种种，形成自身风格鲜明的NFT美学叙事。\n\n我们期待在未来，这一类具有高文艺素养的加密艺术家群体会给NFT市场带来更多审美的观照。\n\n![Source:https://m.cosmochamber.art/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zkV9mYh9oZUOoECXJw5Ny.png?height=224&width=468)\n\nCosmo Chamber的独特性还在于它是一个门户、一个节点，为美学创作的融合提供了良好的协作环境：\n\n\n`\"Each artist brings their unique visual style into the project while sharing a collective interest in the sensibility of the Far East.\"`\n\n\n在这个意义上，远东世界的感性成为一种被集体共享的质素，而每个艺术家又能以自身独一无二的风格参与其中，在个性与异质性中达至“远东的美学共识“。\n\nCosmo Chamber项目分四个阶段推进，直至合成完整的宇宙客厅。在未来，收藏者还有望发现通往其他宇宙的隐藏门。空房间内的那扇圆窗，在东方神秘主义的艺术表现下，意味着玄之又玄的多重可能性。\n\n![Source:

something good”——Kanon利用去中心化金融生态系统来重塑赞助、慈善、策展和托管，试图创造一种艺术表达、结构实验和金融收益相辅相成的“价值飞轮”。\n\n![Source:https://www.block123.com/zh-hans/nav/150848115390.htm](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S5GFuQoLPaLOTPH_JctQO.png?height=288&width=468)\n\nKanon通过KSPEC--Kanon的开源协议，为基于数字化的链上艺术的记录和保存带来了博物馆学的最佳实践。KSPEC扩展了ERC-721 NFT标准，使复杂的艺术品、其出处、策展背景、艺术家的身份和意图都能被无限期透明地保存下来。K21将是第一个符合KSPEC标准的NFT藏品。\n\n![Source:

https://kanondotart.medium.com/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/L98KLqjByZ3l2O_F7nKyV.png?height=235&width=468)\n\n在K21画廊中，我们可以看到中国艺术家曹斐的作品《Einstein on the Beach—Chasing the Moon／沙滩上的爱因斯坦-追月》（China Tracy，2021）\n\nKanon的整体风格与它的项目愿景都很艺术，向我们展现了NFT的又一种演绎方式——它有时诉诸当代性的、现时的创作，有时则像Kanon正在做的：很好地结合了NFT链上保存的永久性与透明性、与其他加密原生工具的融合性等诸多特质，引入一种历史的向度，置于当代面前。\n\n【POAP Delivery】#NFT Collectibles\n与Kanon同样表达了一种历史意识的还有一个小猪项目：POAP Delivery，在这里我们顺带提一下。POAP是一个“出勤证明徽章协议“，可以使活动创建者向用户发行出勤证明或活动参与证明徽章。通过POAP Delivery可以获取POAP以记住曾经参与的历史性事件。它是基于Merkle树的空投，通过特别的POAP向过往那些事件的参与者致敬。\n\n【Shoyu】#NFT

asset”，并且被分成了许多shares——“文化资产证券化”。在模式上，它和NFT与区块链的关系其实并不密切。\n\n![Source:https://www.withotis.com/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kAngECcQsJQKYjw-YQiv-.png?height=183&width=468)\n\nOtis的美学要素主要来自所谓的“Nostalgia”氛围——怀旧、复古，数字时代的收藏盒。Otis列出的一些收藏品有：\n\no\tBlue Eyes White Dragon Yu-Gi-Oh Card（2002 LOB-001 First Edition BGS 9.5 GEM-MT）“青眼白龙”，《游戏王》卡牌；\no\tDarth Vader Action Figure（1978 Star Wars Kenner “12-A SKU on Figure Stand” AFA 85）达斯·维德，《星球大战》；\no\tVenusaur Pokémon Card（1999 Pokémon 1st Edition Shadowless Holo Venusaur #15 PSA 10）妙蛙花，《神奇宝贝》1999年卡牌；\no\tSuper Mario 64（Wata 9.6, A+ Seal, Nintendo 64）超级马里奥；\no\tOriginal iPhone（Apple iPhone 2G, A1203,

Bill这一件艺术藏品很有意思，它的创作者MSCHF将3份真实的医疗账单变成了画作出售，用以消除73,360.36美元的医疗债务。通过将医疗账单变成一幅画，MSCHF着手使两种货币力量相等且彼此抵消，同时也对美国医疗系统表达了自己的态度。\n\nOtis的收藏品中，与篮球有关的球星卡交易显然不及NBATopShot，且资产证券化的模式也并非加密领域的“新玩法”，但它就像是藏匿在喧哗主街背后弄堂里的怀旧店铺，等待我们从NFT眼花缭乱的霓虹里抽身，偶然踏入此店。\n\n（2）Crypto与Web3网络集成\n\n上述项目可视作NFT领域审美要素的入场序曲，而相应的网络集成与个人收藏库将有助于我们更好地成为一种Crypto Existence。它们提出的更自由、平等的方案将有助于消减传统的壁垒，回归人的主体性，也为整个加密领域带来更大的想象空间。\n\n【RSS3】#一个Web 3.0 时代内容社交网络设计的开放协议\n\n![Source:

Our donors, contributors and the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole trusts and relies on us to act responsibly and with integrity at all times. As such, the manner in which we conduct ourselves and deal with others will impact how well we build, retain and strengthen their trust. As contractors, volunteers, interns, consultants, and/or business partners (“**you**”, “**your**”, “**yourself**”) who work with us in any capacity, how you conduct yourself will similarly be a reflection on us as well.  \n\nIt is our policy (“**Policy**”) to conduct all of our business in an honest and ethical manner. We take a zero-tolerance approach to exploitation or improper disclosure of confidential and proprietary information for personal gain and are committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships. \n\nBy signing on the acceptance page attached as a schedule to this Policy and returning it with a duplicate of this Policy to us, you have agreed to comply with and be bound by the terms of this Policy.\n\n### Definitions\n\nIn this Policy, the following terms have the following meanings ascribed to them:\n\n“**Confidential Information**” means any information and data of any kind that the Company designates as being confidential or which, under the circumstances surrounding disclosure, ought to be treated as confidential whether disclosed before, on or after the date of this Policy by the Company or any of its representatives, to you or any of your representatives. \n\n“**ENS Digital Assets**” means any digital assets launched by the ENS Project or by projects in which the Company is involved, including (without limitation) ENS names.\n\n“**Inside Information**” means any market-sensitive or material non-public information, which refers to any information not publicly available that a reasonable investor would consider in deciding whether to buy or sell ENS Digital Assets and may relate to the Company, the ENS Project, a partner, sponsor, donor, project, ENS names or digital assets.\n\n### Guidance on Confidential Information\n\nJust to provide a few examples, Confidential Information includes the following:\n\n* technology, information and/or personal data provided by the Company pertaining to the Company’s business, operations, processes, plans, projects or strategies;\n* the Company’s trade secrets, market opportunities, negotiations, discussions, and contracts with other companies, customers or projects; and \n* any information relating to or generated by the Company that is not publicly available through independent public sources (e.g. the newspaper, websites, social media pages).\n\n### Guidance on Inside Information\n\nThere is no bright line test for determining whether particular information is material or market-sensitive. Such a determination depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. If information could reasonably be expected to affect the price of the ENS Digital Assets, or would provide a buyer or seller of ENS Digital Assets with a material informational advantage in a decision to buy, sell or register any ENS Digital Assets, then such information should be considered material or market-sensitive. Importantly, whether such information is considered material or market-sensitive will be considered with the benefit of hindsight. Hence, if the price of the ENS Digital Asset changed as a result of such information have been made public, it will likely be considered material or market-sensitive by us.\n\nJust to provide a few examples, the following information and matters should normally be regarded as material or market-sensitive:\n\n* news about token sales, airdrops, token listings, forks, project launches;\n* financial performance of the Company, or significant changes in financial performance or liquidity;\n* strategic plans, business initiatives, potential mergers or acquisitions, new partnerships;\n* new major contracts, orders, projects, suppliers, customers or finance sources or loss thereof;\n* major discoveries or significant changes or developments in research or technologies;\n* significant changes in senior management;\n* actual or threatened major litigation, or resolution of such litigation; and\n* contents of draft press releases and publications which may affect the market price of the ENS Digital Assets.\n\n### What is prohibited?\n\nYou may, during the course of your work, be aware of Inside Information and Confidential Information. \n\n**Confidentiality obligations**\n\nYou must always:\n\n* protect Confidential Information – even after your engagement, partnership, collaboration or work with the Company ends;\n* keep electronic and paper documents and files containing Confidential Information in a safe place with access limited to only those who are authorised to peruse it;\n* obtain appropriate approval from Confidential Information content owners and non-disclosure agreements from external parties before releasing Confidential Information to them;\n* ensure that information received from third parties is from authorised sources and that information is used in accordance with specified conditions; and\n* implement necessary safeguards to protect Confidential Information against risks of loss or destruction, or unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure.\n\nYou must never:\n\n* disclose Confidential Information to any third party unless you are authorised by us to share such Confidential Information with a specified third party for business reasons; or\n* provide personal information to anyone without appropriate approval.\n\n\n* General Prohibitions against insider trading, market misconduct and abuse of first-mover advantage\n\nYou must never:\n\n* use Inside Information and/or Confidential Information for your personal gain or to cause detriment to others either directly or indirectly (including without limitation by way of information-advantaged decisions to register or purchase ENS names, or through family members, friends, associates or acquaintances);\n* engage in activities to manipulate the price of Company-related Digital Assets;\n* discuss or disclose any Inside Information and/or Confidential Information inside or outside your dealings with the Company other than in the proper course of business and as authorised as part of your regular duties for the Company; \n* provide any Inside Information and/or Confidential Information to another person who may trade or advise others to trade on the basis of that Inside Information and/or Confidential Information; and/or\n* make any recommendations or give trading advice of any kind to others to deal in ENS Digital Assets, where you are aware of Inside Information and/or Confidential Information.\n\nIf in doubt as to whether any course of action may be a breach of this Policy, please consult Nick Johnson or Brantly Millegan. \n\n**Breach of this Policy**\n\nThe consequences of prohibited insider trading, market manipulation and breach of confidence can be severe. Even an appearance of a breach of this Policy can seriously damage our reputation. As such, we may terminate any contractual relationship with you without any compensation and without notice, in the event that we find that you are in breach of this Policy. \n\nPersons found in violation of this Policy may also be required to disgorge the profit made or loss avoided by the trade of ENS Digital Assets, or purchase, registration or transfer of ENS names and compensate the Company for such related losses.", "timestamp": 1635996543, "digest": "qjlFjV5QSs17li8Tu5O6_7WoSMEak2D1YP0ED-Mp-GA", "contributor": "0x983110309620D911731Ac0932219af06091b6744"}

'Laughter is the language of the soul.' Efficient and timely. Especially since it cost 3 pages to write.\"`\n\n![Source:

Musk、Sotheby's的关注，而对于我们而言，更重要的或许是神秘莫测的诗人形象与那些文学要素、现代诗性、审美气质乃至哲学隐喻若有若无的关联。倘若它能像“Pablo Neruda”一样在冷下来的NFT市场中进入人们的日常生活，勾连起”超越生活“的诗歌与每一个NFT持有人个体生活的响应，不妨称它为一场NFT文艺运动。\n\n【Hashmasks】#NFT

POETS」的命名机制及肖像盲盒早有先声——Hashmasks。Hashmasks是一个NFT数字艺术收藏品项目，由全球70多名艺术家创作，采用盲盒拍卖方式启动。\n\nHashmasks的系列NFT中，每个都有艺术家自身灌输的价值观和隐喻/暗含特征，并且都是独一无二的。整体来看，Hask与CryptoPunk的IP机制类似，但添加了冠名权和stake概念，让其具有了更多的价值捕获和沉淀手段。Hashmasks知名度较高，在此不作具体分析。Hashmasks后期发展可参考下图——“Hashmasks’

Chamber是十月推出的NFT项目，通过以太坊ERC721协议发行6001枚不重复的「宇宙客厅」NFT。与LOST POETS相比，Cosmo Chamber的机制设计较为简单，但它的东方美学表达及诸多细节却是NFT市场的审美高标。\n\n根据项目op上的介绍，Cosmo Chamber是对Hashmask的一次致意，这是首个具有东方感性（Eastern sensibility）的NFT集合。创作「宇宙客厅」的四位艺术家都“Continuing a long lineage of interest in Eastern philosophies and the literati tradition”——对东方哲学和文士传统的志趣存在着绵延已久的谱系，而他们正是这一谱系的延续者。\n\nCosmo Chamber试图摒弃快餐式的NFT，为那些真正在意美学的群体带来一个独特的NFT元宇宙——一场东方视阈下的“奥德赛式”的美学空间跋涉。项目的灵感取自The Double Screen一书，表达出对时空宇宙的另一种体悟。\n\n![Source:

Chamber不仅是一个NFT collection，更是NFT创作者中一类新兴群体集中性的话语载体。\n\n以该项目为例，多元的文化知识背景：东方神秘主义、佛教思想、文身文化；艺术表达的历史感：明朝工笔画的承继；传统在现代数字技术中的复兴：古典风景画与计算机生成的3D景观的融合……如此种种，形成自身风格鲜明的NFT美学叙事。\n\n我们期待在未来，这一类具有高文艺素养的加密艺术家群体会给NFT市场带来更多审美的观照。\n\n![Source:https://m.cosmochamber.art/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zkV9mYh9oZUOoECXJw5Ny.png?height=224&width=468)\n\nCosmo Chamber的独特性还在于它是一个门户、一个节点，为美学创作的融合提供了良好的协作环境：\n\n\n`\"Each artist brings their unique visual style into the project while sharing a collective interest in the sensibility of the Far East.\"`\n\n\n在这个意义上，远东世界的感性成为一种被集体共享的质素，而每个艺术家又能以自身独一无二的风格参与其中，在个性与异质性中达至“远东的美学共识“。\n\nCosmo Chamber项目分四个阶段推进，直至合成完整的宇宙客厅。在未来，收藏者还有望发现通往其他宇宙的隐藏门。空房间内的那扇圆窗，在东方神秘主义的艺术表现下，意味着玄之又玄的多重可能性。\n\n![Source:

Art\n\n![Source:https://kanon.art/?ref=block123](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iKI3vr2bdaMvXkBdb0_C8.png?height=232&width=468)\n\nKanon是一个艺术、设计、加密原生技术的集合，“下一个百年”的展望让它具备了一种历史的意识，这是我们将它同样归入“审美的入场”这一分类的原因。\n\n但同时，它又很好地利用了DeFi等其他加密原生工具来“do something good”——Kanon利用去中心化金融生态系统来重塑赞助、慈善、策展和托管，试图创造一种艺术表达、结构实验和金融收益相辅相成的“价值飞轮”。\n\n![Source:https://www.block123.com/zh-hans/nav/150848115390.htm](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S5GFuQoLPaLOTPH_JctQO.png?height=288&width=468)\n\nKanon通过KSPEC--Kanon的开源协议，为基于数字化的链上艺术的记录和保存带来了博物馆学的最佳实践。KSPEC扩展了ERC-721 NFT标准，使复杂的艺术品、其出处、策展背景、艺术家的身份和意图都能被无限期透明地保存下来。K21将是第一个符合KSPEC标准的NFT藏品。\n\n![Source:

https://kanondotart.medium.com/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/L98KLqjByZ3l2O_F7nKyV.png?height=235&width=468)\n\n在K21画廊中，我们可以看到中国艺术家曹斐的作品《Einstein on the Beach—Chasing the Moon／沙滩上的爱因斯坦-追月》（China Tracy，2021）\n\nKanon的整体风格与它的项目愿景都很艺术，向我们展现了NFT的又一种演绎方式——它有时诉诸当代性的、现时的创作，有时则像Kanon正在做的：很好地结合了NFT链上保存的永久性与透明性、与其他加密原生工具的融合性等诸多特质，引入一种历史的向度，置于当代面前。\n\n【POAP Delivery】#NFT Collectibles\n与Kanon同样表达了一种历史意识的还有一个小猪项目：POAP Delivery，在这里我们顺带提一下。POAP是一个“出勤证明徽章协议“，可以使活动创建者向用户发行出勤证明或活动参与证明徽章。通过POAP Delivery可以获取POAP以记住曾经参与的历史性事件。它是基于Merkle树的空投，通过特别的POAP向过往那些事件的参与者致敬。\n\n【Shoyu】#NFT

investing\n\n![Source:https://www.withotis.com/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wgu7Tq-ZlhQhptGkvMgXd.png?height=67&width=468)\n\nOtis的本质是一个将非同质化的物品（代币）进行同质化、代币化，从而使它便于被小用户投资的项目，基本模式是以App为主要操作平台，投资收藏品、运动鞋和艺术品以分享其随时间推移价值增长的红利。收藏品种类多样，它们被成为“cultural asset”，并且被分成了许多shares——“文化资产证券化”。在模式上，它和NFT与区块链的关系其实并不密切。\n\n![Source:https://www.withotis.com/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kAngECcQsJQKYjw-YQiv-.png?height=183&width=468)\n\nOtis的美学要素主要来自所谓的“Nostalgia”氛围——怀旧、复古，数字时代的收藏盒。Otis列出的一些收藏品有：\n\no\tBlue Eyes White Dragon Yu-Gi-Oh Card（2002 LOB-001 First Edition BGS 9.5 GEM-MT）“青眼白龙”，《游戏王》卡牌；\no\tDarth Vader Action Figure（1978 Star Wars Kenner “12-A SKU on Figure Stand” AFA 85）达斯·维德，《星球大战》；\no\tVenusaur Pokémon Card（1999 Pokémon 1st Edition Shadowless Holo Venusaur #15 PSA 10）妙蛙花，《神奇宝贝》1999年卡牌；\no\tSuper Mario 64（Wata 9.6, A+ Seal, Nintendo 64）超级马里奥；\no\tOriginal iPhone（Apple iPhone 2G, A1203, Sealed）“创世iphone“（还有下图所示的第一代iPod）；\n\n![Source:https://www.withotis.com/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9m1_zXUMja_A0BgRzQfVK.png?height=251&width=468)\n\n![Source:https://www.withotis.com/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gPTC5C3OfRL2TydQvBLAq.png?height=324&width=468)\n\nMedical Bill这一件艺术藏品很有意思，它的创作者MSCHF将3份真实的医疗账单变成了画作出售，用以消除73,360.36美元的医疗债务。通过将医疗账单变成一幅画，MSCHF着手使两种货币力量相等且彼此抵消，同时也对美国医疗系统表达了自己的态度。\n\nOtis的收藏品中，与篮球有关的球星卡交易显然不及NBATopShot，且资产证券化的模式也并非加密领域的“新玩法”，但它就像是藏匿在喧哗主街背后弄堂里的怀旧店铺，等待我们从NFT眼花缭乱的霓虹里抽身，偶然踏入此店。\n\n（2）Crypto与Web3网络集成\n\n上述项目可视作NFT领域审美要素的入场序曲，而相应的网络集成与个人收藏库将有助于我们更好地成为一种Crypto Existence。它们提出的更自由、平等的方案将有助于消减传统的壁垒，回归人的主体性，也为整个加密领域带来更大的想象空间。\n\n【RSS3】#一个Web 3.0 时代内容社交网络设计的开放协议\n\n![Source:

年度云栖大会」上重申了这一观点。\n\n当然，也许会有人说元宇宙是一群科技精英和投资玩家编撰出来的又一个炒作概念，只不过是为了在资本市场讲更好地故事，但事实真的如此吗？\n\n从媒体的角度来看，人们讨厌一片倒的声音，所以媒体教程里有一个技巧是「反其道而行之」？或者叫「换一个角度」，即当绝大部分人都在说好的时候，要勇敢地站出来说它不好，这样才有机会可以博得大众眼球，也有一定概率成为爆文，所以很大意义上这是媒体观点，而不是思考逻辑的结果。\n\n**事实上，笔者更倾向于认为元宇宙是时代发展的趋势**，就好比 2010 年乔布斯在旧金山发布 iPhone4 手机一样，某种意义上我们无法抗拒，只是我们恰好在这一时刻打开了元宇宙的潘多拉盒子，或者说在经历一段时期后我们终于来到了元宇宙的边缘，而下面笔者将从 4 个方面来佐证这一观点（以下观点在 1 个月前作为内部线下分享首次提出）。\n\n### 硬件的更新迭代：从收音机到 VR\n\n1901 年，意大利无线电工程师伽利尔摩·马可尼成功发明了能够跨越大西洋的无线电波，随后他创建了世界上第一个收音机工厂并获得专利。而真正让收音机开始走进千家万户的是 kdka 广播电台的出现，1920 年 11 月 20 日，kdka 广播了第一条广播，消息是：沃伦·哈丁击败詹姆·考克斯当选为总统，因此 kdka 广播也被公认为世界上第一个真正的无线广播电台。\n\n据波士顿学院传播学教授、芝加哥广播通信博物馆教育部主任迈克尔·基思回忆，**在那两年时间里，美国有了 500 家电台和约 150 万台收音机，并且美国每一个大都市都有了自己的电台**。\n\n之后的故事大家都知道了，广播风靡了全世界，在上世纪初期席卷了全球家庭，甚至在 90 年代我们国内依然畅销，是许多老辈子获取最新信息的重要来源。\n\n再到后来我们有了黑白电视，有了彩电，人们从声音世界逐步转化到了图像信息，节目的丰富度也大大提高，可以说电视成为了许多 80 后小时候的记忆。\n\n而到了 90 年代中叶，1946 年，全世界第一台电子数字计算机 ENIAC 在美国宾夕法尼亚州立大学莫尔电工学院诞生，由此开启了我们更为熟知的信息化高速，也迎来了延续至今的互联网时代。\n\n当然，**互联网时代还有一个重要转折点是移动智能手机的普及，也就是乔布斯先生缔造的王国，并带来了更多的创新，也颠覆了我们的生产生活**。\n\n分析机构 Strategy Analytics 的最新研究表明，截至 2021 年 6 月，全球一半人口都拥有智能手机，约为 40 亿人，但是智能手机在 10-15 年前才算真正开始进入市场，其增速令人错愕。\n\n面对如此庞大的用户，我们不禁思考，智能手机还能怎么进化？人们的日常社交娱乐设备还能怎么演变？难道让智能设备生产商面对增速放缓都去造车吗？\n\n我们再看另一组数据：**IDC 数据显示，2021 年第一季度全球 VR 头显出货量同比增长 52.4%，展望未来，IDC 预测 2021 年 VR 头显全球出货量将同比增长 28.9%**，但这是受制于疫情带来的供应问题而测算，长期来看 VR 头显市场增长依然十分强劲，IDC 的报告预计全球出货量将于 2025 年增长至 2860 万台，五年复合年增长率（CAGR）为 41.4%。\n\n而全球知名 VR 游戏《Beat Saber》（中文常称为「节奏光剑」）销量在 3 月就超过了 400 万份，付费 DLC 的歌曲销量超过 4000 万份，营收超过了 1.8 亿美元，远超市场的预估。\n\n**从数据上我们可以直观看出智能手机增速在放缓，而 VR 设备在经历一段低谷期后开始展现出真正的活力**，虽然 IDC 预测 VR 头显市场出货量未来不及 3000 万台，但这一数据显然低估了市场的增速，毕竟今年第一季度全球 VR 头显设备出货量和去年同期相比增长了 52.4%。\n\n我们知道 VR 设备将会是元宇宙非常重要的一环，就好比于智能手机和移动互联网一样，如果 90 年代有人告诉你未来我们会在一个手机上（当时还是「大哥大」或者小灵通）购物社交，甚至每天超过 6 小时沉浸在这个世界里（QuestMobile 数据），估计会被人骂是疯子，但现在这就是事实。\n\n那么，未来呢？人们是否会像逐渐抛弃收音机和电视一样，逐步放下智能手机，并找到下一个硬件产品，那么它会是 VR 设备吗，这个承载着元宇宙的基础硬件？\n\n沿着这一思路再想下去，谁会成为元宇宙里的乔布斯，哪一款硬件又会成为 iPhone4 一样的颠覆级产品？\n\n### Z 时代消费人群的变化\n\n如果说硬件的变化还仅仅是「小荷才露尖尖角」，那么人群结构和消费者的变化则是肉眼可见的改变。\n\n我们不得不承认，随着时间的推移，曾经还略显年轻或青涩的 80、90 后如今也已步入青壮年，而被称为 Z 世代（定义为 95 后+00 后）的新的种子选手却在悄然成长着，**按照年初统计的数据，Z 世代的网络活跃用户已经超过 3.2 亿人，占全体移动网民 28.1%**（QuestMobile 数据）。\n\n按照数据统计，Z 世代们的网络月人均使用时长近 175 个小时，高出全网用户 35 个小时，我们按照一个月 480 小时的可活动时间（减去三分之一的睡眠）计算，这一占比接近 40% 的日常活动时间。\n\n另一方面，**Z 世代也被称为互联网真正的原著居民，他们可能从记事起就有了互联网的陪伴，甚至已经走在了时代的前沿，因此他们的网络使用特点愈加鲜明**。\n\n而根据 QuestMobile2020「Z 世代」洞察报告显示，Z 世代们的用户画像中包含了「动漫」、「明星」和「游戏」三个重要的标签，也因此他们对盲盒经济、公仔 IP 经济、颜值经济和偶像经济这些在老大哥们看来不太理解的领域反而游刃有余。\n\n当我们谈到 Z 世代时，不得不提到当前月活超过 2.37 亿年轻用户（18-35 岁用户占比 78%）的 B 站，人们从以前的不理解到逐步接纳其中的一些文化，包括二次元、虚拟偶像和弹幕文化。\n\n而在今年「双十一」活动期间，淘宝举办了「天猫双 11 首届元宇宙艺术展」，里面的虚拟代言人 AYAYI 更是受到了不少年轻用户的追捧。\n\n同时，关于 Z 世代的另一组数据也值得我们关注，视频娱乐形式深受 Z 世代青睐，人均每月花费在视频娱乐上接近 50 个小时，从这个数据上我们便可以直观的看出为什么图文内容打开率越来越低的原因，毕竟年轻用户的选择才是未来的方向。\n\n但由此我们不禁想到一个变化，当视频的表达方式越来越受到网络用户青睐时，下一步会有怎样的呈现？我们也不禁思考或许 VR/AR 的视频会带来更有趣的体验，既然是更有趣、更新潮的东西，Z 世代们会拒绝吗？毕竟在许多 90 后眼里都不太理解的盲盒都成长出了上千亿的市场。\n\n如果我们细心的去思考一件事，会发现，**科技的进步已经超越了大部分人的设想，而人类作为创造者一方面在适应，另一方面还在持续不断的创新**，但这也是社会和科技与人类历史相辅相成发展的原因，我们谁也逃不过这个螺旋向上的漩涡。\n\n### 疫情带来的大变局\n\n回看过去两年发生的重大社会事件，我们不得不承认疫情对全球产生了深远的影响，甚至即使现在我们也还说不清这场已持续几十个月的疫情最终会带来什么变化，但站在这样一个窗口去思考一些内生的逻辑，大概已经从猝不及防到逐渐适应了。\n\n正如著名历史学者、畅销书《人类简史》作者尤瓦尔·赫拉利对疫情的看法，**再过数十年，当人们回顾历史的时候，如果他们还记得新冠肺炎疫情，他们记住的不是疫情本身，而是「哦，就是从那时开始，世界完全数字化了」**。\n\n这句话似乎印证了过去 2 年的一些变化，正如知名视频会议软件 Zoom 的股价走势一样，其在新冠病毒大流行期间因居家工作而受到关注，尽管部分地区的疫情已经有所放缓，但一些科技公司似乎已经感受到了数字化办公所带来的好处，但这只是表象，更多的变化已经暗流涌动。\n\n美国的 Enterprise Technology Research （ETR）在去年 9 月份调查了 1200 名不同行业的首席信息官，最终**预计在 2021 年，全世界将会有 34% 的员工永久在家办公，而疫情前，在家办公的员工数量仅为 16.4%**。\n\n以携程为例，2020 年疫情爆发期间，携程 11 条业务线近 70% 的客服员工实施了「在家办公」，部分部门在家办公人员比例近 85%。而结果显示，由于不受办公室干扰和通勤时间等因素的影响，在家办公的人可以完成更多的工作。因此，今年 8 月携程启动了「2021 混合办公试验」，通过为期半年的 A/B 测试来验证居家办公的真实效果，而试验组的员工每周三和周五在家办公。\n\n当然对于携程这样的实验结果我们保持好奇，但更多的是数字化办公的趋势同样成为了疫情期间众多公司的选择，毕竟像微软、Twitter 和 Facebook 这样的海外巨头公司早就宣布允许员工们永久在家办公。\n\n我们有理由相信，**居家办公的改变仅仅是疫情带来的一个比较明显的变化，实则是，我们需要逐步跨越物理空间的限制，找到一个新的平衡**，但如果有一个产品可以既做到无需真实物理空间的跨越也能「触手可达」，这样的痛点便有了 Facebook 搭建的「元宇宙会议」，也才使得 Facebook 看到了元宇宙更大的潜力，甚至更换了公司名称。\n\n同时，物理空间的跨越也让成千上万人同时在线听音乐会有了可能，这便是今年 4 月 ,《堡垒之夜》与美国著名说唱歌手 Travis Scott 联合在全球各大服务器上演的一场名为「Astronomical」的「沉浸式」大型演唱会，吸引了超过 2770 万名玩家前往观看，但这在现实世界是完全不可能实现的。\n\n我们一方面迫切希望疫情早点结束，但另一方面我们又不得不正视疫情带来的影响，甚至开始做出改变去适应它，毕竟历史上每一次重大历史变故都会带来新的变化，这次也不例外。**而早在今年 7 月，奥斯陆国际和平研究所与约翰霍普金斯大学根据官方数据统计，过去一年半的死亡人数（400 万）大约相当于自 1982 年以来所有世界战争中阵亡人数的总和（如今已接近 500 万）**。\n\n或许多年后当我们回看这段历史时真的会有这样的感慨：原来那场疫情影响如此甚远。\n\n### 过去 30 年新兴科技的交融\n\n当我们把时间维度放入到历史的进程时，疫情、科技与人类发展之间似乎来到了一个交汇点，新的科技产品亟需更新迭代来适应新兴消费群体的崛起，而疫情带来的影响又会加速某些进程，尤其是数字化，由此我们看到了一些原本漂浮在遥远未来的东西已经加速来到了我们身边，元宇宙便是这样的存在。\n\n**回看过去 30 年的科技发展，用「颠覆」来形容也不足为过，尤其是进入 21 世纪 20 年代后，我们可以直观的看到 5G 正在加速、物联网的设备飞速进入人们生产生活、人工智能从 AlphaGo 之后开启了新征程**。同时芯片领域依然遵循着摩尔定律发展着，甚至我们还看到了人们对互联网更高的使用追求，包括了区块链和 Web3.0 的逐渐落地。当然，还有越来越轻便的 VR/AR 设备，这便是真真实实的科技进步。\n\n被誉为「最接近理查德·费曼的科学家」迈克斯·泰格马克在《生命 3.0》中对未来生命有了新的定义，他称其为「生命 3.0」，具体来说，未来的生命不仅能设计自身的软件，还能设计自身的硬件，最终能完全摆脱进化的束缚，比如变形金刚。\n\n迈克斯的生命 3.0 可能更符合人类的进程，也贴近科技进步的极限，但作为血肉之躯的我们一方面凭借科技的外衣实现了上天入地，另一方面也通过科技产品去获得体验和链接，**前者是科技的外显，后者是科技的内显**，正如微软公司和 Facebook 一样，他们都是时代的产物。\n\n那么时间来到了今天，凭借创造新能源汽车、SpaceX 和脑机接口的科技新贵马斯克已经成为了新的全球首富，特斯拉市值也突破万亿市值，与老牌科技公司相比，马斯克似乎代表着一个新的时代，那么在这样的背景下，谁会是同时期的「Facebook」或者「微软」？\n\n就目前来看，在有限的想象空间内，元宇宙似乎可以承载出下一个万亿市值的公司（我们把区块链技术也归结到元宇宙里），毕竟电商、娱乐、社交似乎都可以在元宇宙中重塑一遍，而这三大方向在过去 30 年都诞生出了不少巨无霸，那么这次会不同吗？\n\n### 总结\n\n最后，我们再次回到主题来看，「为什么说元宇宙的发展是大势所趋」，**因为智能设备来到了新的进化点，因为消费人群迎来了改观，疫情带来的百年之大变局，各类技术也到了一个新的开闸口，而这些的交汇点之一至少我们看到了元宇宙的身影**。\n\n虽然咱古人有句老话叫「王婆卖瓜自卖自夸」，又好像是「屁股决定脑袋」的事儿，但元宇宙的发挥可能比我们想象的更加有憧憬，毕竟从数百年前人们希冀着能够通达全球，到 50 多年前互联网带来的信息无缝链接，按照某种过渡的逻辑，接下来的想象便是即使身处车水马龙，也可真实感受「大漠孤烟直，长河落日圆」的壮丽。\n\n当然，我们也看到了众多科技公司不断加码元宇宙赛道，但按照创新的逻辑来说，那些真正具备颠覆性创新的产品可能很难从大玩家手里出来，即使有，也更可能是内部孵化或者革新，毕竟大船难掉头的故事在《基业长青》中也少有存在。\n\n5 年前可以说是区块链最佳的创业时期，甚至是荒蛮之地里的一个巨大冒险岛，但现在区块链已经从山野逐渐走向了殿堂，意味着更多束缚和既定的玩家，**不过区块链带来的应用依然还很早期，而区块链+元宇宙的效用或许才是理解真正「元宇宙」的伏笔，而不仅仅是再造一个虚拟世界这样简单**。\n\n商业世界有一个经典的故事，100 年前街上充盈着的还并不是汽车，而是各种体型的马车，所以那时候人们还担心持续增长的马车会带来铺天盖地的马粪危机，甚至在 1898 年召开了有史以来第一次以马粪为主题的国际会议，但后来马粪危机成了过去时，马车也退出了历史舞台。\n\n当然，马车故事中那几十万马车夫如果没有选择适应汽车的到来，可能后半辈子只会在游乐园或农场度过。\n\n那么，元宇宙真的要到来了吗？我想，它可能比汽车取代马车的时间要快。", "timestamp": 1635996865, "digest":

{"id": "U0idgLFm3OwjCwxBFlrvTIxB10WGh-OSUAtVcivvVXk", "title": "什么是智能合约?以及它的工作原理", "body": "　　为了正确理解什么是智能合约以及我们为什么要使用它们，我们首先需要缩小并了解在智能合约概念出现之前就存在的最早的加密货币。\n\n　　创建的第一个加密货币(从 2009 年开始)没有智能合约，直到后来才推出第一个功能齐全的智能合约区块链(以太坊)，以解决使用加密货币的人们发现的一些缺失功能他们想。\n\n　　一开始，只有比特币。中本聪以其无穷的智慧将比特币带给了我们，全世界看过他作品的人都认为它很好。\n\n　　比特币是第一个存在的数字货币，是对金融体系不透明的权力结构和影响政府发行货币的失控货币通货膨胀的反应，特别是在 2008 年全球金融危机之后。\n\n　　它是第一个由数学和密码学而不是由隐藏在封闭的门后的一小群有权势的人统治的公开透明的货币。使用比特币，首次以完全自由的公开透明方式存储和转移价值成为可能。\n\n　　然而，比特币有一些限制，这源于其设计的有目的的简单性。虽然可以在分布在世界各地的人们之间进行简单的支付，也可以创建非常简单的应用程序(例如多重签名钱包)，但不可能创建更复杂的应用程序。\n\n　　因此，随着时间的推移，出现了对更复杂的“可编程货币”的需求，它可以允许程序员编写任何代码并允许它执行与加密货币相关的交易。\n\n　　**什么是智能合约?**\n\n　　从技术角度来看，智能合约是存储在区块链上的代码，可以执行一组精心预定义的操作，以响应人类从钱包进行交易或由其他智能合约触发的操作。\n\n　　以太坊引入了“智能合约”区块链的概念，为程序员提供了更大的灵活性。这最终意味着任何可以在普通计算机上编写和执行的计算机程序也可以在以太坊上运行(尽管在实践中这样做可能非常昂贵!)因此，这提供了以前无法想象的数量通过设计一系列可以相互操作的智能合约，创造整个金融生态系统和创新的潜力。\n\n　　**它们是如何工作的?**\n\n　　智能合约可以被认为是存储并在区块链上运行的计算机程序。因此，智能合约通常包含“if…then…”语句的变体，根据各种输入和条件执行某些逻辑。\n\n　　以太坊是当今最流行的智能合约区块链，它拥有自己的编程语言 Solidity，开发人员使用它来创建应用程序。\n\n　　一旦编写，合约被编译成低级“字节码”，然后“部署”到特定的以太坊地址，以太坊的任何用户和其他合约都可以访问该地址。\n\n　　为了与该智能合约的代码进行交互，人们将通过将包含特定数据的交易发送到合约的以太坊地址来调用函数。这可以通过Metamask等钱包完成。\n\n　　**智能合约可以用来做什么?**\n\n　　智能合约的用例非常广泛，我们已经看到了大量的创新。当今最流行的用途包括代表多种不同资产的代币、去中心化金融(DeFi) 和代表艺术品的不可替代代币 (NFT)。然而，很可能还有很多其他的应用还没有被想象到!\n\n　　许多最早的智能合约用例非常简单，但是，随着时间的推移，复杂性增加了。智能合约最强大的元素之一是它们能够相互交互，这导致了围绕它们成长的生态系统。例如，DeFi 开始创建替代金融系统，该系统开始时只有一些最简单的元素，如代币和交易所，但现在包括保险、复杂的衍生品等。\n\n　　智能合约功能的简单示例包括：\n\n　　跟踪谁拥有哪些资产(代币)\n\n　　代表艺术品和其他资产 (NFT) 的所有权\n\n　　允许分散和透明的投票(治理)\n\n　　在满足条件时向适当的各方发放资金(去中心化交易所)\n\n　　当某些条件发生时发出事件，允许自动监控(通知)\n\n　　**有什么好处?**\n\n　　**透明的**\n\n　　任何查看区块链的人都可以观察到智能合约代码，因此管理它们的规则是完全透明的。由于审查水平的提高，与封闭源应用程序、网站或金融机构中可能存在的信任相比，这显着增加了对这些应用程序的信任。可以遵守规则以平等对待所有人，而不是使某些人受益于其他人。例如，去中心化交易所可以证明给每个人相同的价格和相同的费用，而在传统金融世界中，有几个引人注目的案例，发现交易所为他们的一些人提供了更好的条件。客户，允许他们最终以牺牲其他客户为代价来赚钱。\n\n　　**永久不变**\n\n　　一旦创建并部署了智能合约，它就是永久性的，无法更改。这让与他们互动的人相信，未来的变化不会导致引入可能因黑客或错误而导致资金损失的新错误。\n\n　　这也意味着与它们交互的应用程序可以确定使用智能合约构建的协议将永远按预期运行。\n\n　　**高度灵活和可定制**\n\n　　以太坊和其他智能合约平台理论上允许编写和部署任何程序。这为世界各地的开发人员带来了几乎无限的潜力，可以在全球范围内试验和测试他们的新想法，而无需首先创建底层基础设施来承载他们的想法。\n\n　　因此，我们看到了围绕智能合约的大量创新以及在 DeFi中创建的一些非常成功的协议，这些协议在短短几年后就拥有数十亿美元的资产，而且每天都在构建更多!\n\n　　**始终在线且可靠**\n\n　　由于智能合约协议部署在区块链上，因此它们继承了区块链极具弹性且永不脱机的事实。虽然传统网站经常需要维护，在一段时间后关闭，或者在升级过程中遇到问题导致向后兼容，但只要区块链继续存在，智能合约就会存在。\n\n　　这让那些想要建立在智能合约之上的人知道他们只需要做一次工作，并且在一段时间后不会发现系统发生变化或停止工作。\n\n　　**确定性的**\n\n　　智能合约的输出是确定性的，因此总是会导致可证明的结果，可以复制并证明是公平的。无论谁执行输出，每次输出都是相同的。\n\n　　**去信任**\n\n　　区块链确保交易必须遵守编入智能合约的规则，因此两方或多方可以通过它们进行交互，而无需相互信任。\n\n　　**有哪些限制?**\n\n　　**真实世界数据**\n\n　　虽然智能合约非常适合与区块链的其他用户交互以及涉及区块链上已有资产的交易，但为了充分发挥其潜力，他们需要访问有关现实世界的信息。\n\n　　例如，如果我们正在构建一个智能合约作为代管代理，为正在出售的房屋付款，我们需要有一种可靠的方法来知道房屋已被交换。\n\n　　有许多项目致力于以安全和去信任的方式提供“Oracle”数据，以允许应用程序访问这些数据并围绕它们创建逻辑。一个流行的例子是ChainLink。\n\n　　**缺乏可升级性**\n\n　　由于如果存在软件错误，则智能合约在部署后无法更改，因此修复起来要困难得多。在最坏的情况下，这可能导致黑客更大的攻击和资金损失。\n\n　　对此的一种解决方案是，许多协议现在使用“代理”合约作为访问协议的接口，其逻辑保存在第二个智能合约中。虽然不能替换或更改逻辑合约，但可以部署新的升级逻辑，然后可以通知代理仅指向新合约。\n\n　　**成本**\n\n　　虽然理论上可以使用智能合约构建任何计算机程序，但限制因素通常是成本。由于必须在区块链上部署合约、执行交易和存储数据，因此每个操作都会产生相关成本，以避免整体状态变得太大并防止垃圾交易。\n\n　　一般来说，开发人员的目标是尽可能多地“脱链”工作，并且只将智能合约用于真正需要它们提供的好处的核心元素。", "timestamp": 1635996655, "digest": "l2cmflmdBnbdlBmSXUgEQJB4rytACGOSPpLBFtiGuVw", "contributor": "0xbE1aCaAE49c7396F6599333c1B548C7Fa211278D"}

For the LOBS, wait until EOD and take highest bid if current ask untaken.\n\nI did not develop clear falsifications for the LOBS purchase. This is partly because I had no real idea what to look for, or what to look at — I had no observations or orientations for NFTs to work with. After closely following (1) the market with OpenSea and Nansen and (2) the DAO on Telegram and GitHub, I lost faith in two respects:\n\n* the first was that market activity had been dying in both volume and price\n  * on Crypto Twitter, there was little to no mention of LOBS, which in my mind meant that there were not going to be any new buyers outside of the LobsterDAO community\n* the second was that the DAO seemed to be rent-seeking and ambivalent\n  * the de facto leadership of Ivan was ineffectual because Ivan didn’t want to appear as leadership (probably because of regulatory fears)\n\n### what went well\n\n* i informally identified two falsifications:\n  * market activity winding down into stagnation\n  * the DAO demonstrating a lack of widespread initiative and no clear direction, with little buy-in/participation from the vast majority of LOBS holders\n* i developed an exit plan and stuck to it, while keeping a close watch on whether the plan might be modified or improved\n* i have a visceral, gut-wrenching understanding of what it means for a market to be illiquid, and feel like my view of more liquid markets has changed markedly\n\n### what i want to do better next time\n\nIn the future, before entering a market, I want to make sure I understand the specific dangers and dynamics of the market, as well as have a mental model of what historically happened in related or similar situations.\n\nI want to be self-aware and mindful. I want to ensure I only enter trades in which I have some provable, tangible, concrete edge. I want to ensure I only enter trades which are suited for my portfolio and my economic positioning. I want to ensure I only take a trade because I’m bullish on the trade and believe it will be a profitable decision.\n\nI want to ensure a diplomatic immunity to FOMO. Everybody gets what they want to out of the market, and I’ll take the consistent feedback as a means to identify and exorcise any personal demons.\n\nThis is entirely a mental game, and à la CGP Grey, the best way to correct the mental state is by beginning with the physical — yoga and meditation.\n\nSelling the whole portfolio, largely motivated by an emotional reaction to a large loss, was perhaps unwise when considered as an isolated incident.\n\nSelling the whole portfolio, at a meta-level, was good. I took a step back from the market, while I was wholly bullish with a large margin of safety on my liquid positions, because my process (endlessly scrolling crypto twitter) was one which removed my own agency and turned me into a reactionary machine largely consuming manipulative and manufactured content. Continuing to benefit from my process, in the long run, was a damaging habit to reinforce.\n\nCrypto is a generational opportunity, yes. But I can’t continue believing that the only meaningful wealth-generating opportunity I’ll ever have is buying cryptocurrencies earlier than the rest of the world. I especially can’t continue living with a scarcity mindset while my thinking isn’t independent and focused.\n\nI need to realize that the world is full of abundance — and that there is essentially infinite opportunity in financial markets alone.\n\nThe goal is to continually increase my capacity for independent action. I focus on the long-term, developing wisdom and refining my decision-making + leadership skills. I anticipate this will be much like the Bible story concerning Solomon: God gave Solomon the choice between wisdom or riches, and Solomon chose wisdom. God was then so pleased that he gave Solomon both.", "timestamp": 1635998686, "digest": "J7t52b7pJiDijT5N1DR7H7mcFEi2tCC6hCmAbQTnEzE", "contributor": "0xdF3AB3adB9F679d71b9A22ab77565b1FF3A5047D"}

After closely following (1) the market with OpenSea and Nansen and (2) the DAO on Telegram and GitHub, I lost faith in two respects:\n\n* the first was that market activity had been dying in both volume and price\n  * on Crypto Twitter, there was little to no mention of LOBS, which in my mind meant that there were not going to be any new buyers outside of the LobsterDAO community\n* the second was that the DAO seemed to be rent-seeking and ambivalent\n  * the de facto leadership of Ivan was ineffectual because Ivan didn’t want to appear as leadership (probably because of regulatory fears)\n\n### what went well\n\n* i informally identified two falsifications:\n  * market activity winding down into stagnation\n  * the DAO demonstrating a lack of widespread initiative and no clear direction, with little buy-in/participation from the vast majority of LOBS holders\n* i developed an exit plan and stuck to it, while keeping a close watch on whether the plan might be modified or improved\n* i have a visceral, gut-wrenching understanding of what it means for a market to be illiquid, and feel like my view of more liquid markets has changed markedly\n\n### what i want to do better next time\n\nIn the future, before entering a market, I want to make sure I understand the specific dangers and dynamics of the market, as well as have a mental model of what historically happened in related or similar situations.\n\nI want to be self-aware and mindful. I want to ensure I only enter trades in which I have some provable, tangible, concrete edge. I want to ensure I only enter trades which are suited for my portfolio and my economic positioning. I want to ensure I only take a trade because I’m bullish on the trade and believe it will be a profitable decision.\n\nI want to ensure a diplomatic immunity to FOMO. Everybody gets what they want to out of the market, and I’ll take the consistent feedback as a means to identify and exorcise any personal demons.\n\nThis is entirely a mental game, and à la CGP Grey, the best way to correct the mental state is by beginning with the physical — yoga and meditation.\n\nSelling the whole portfolio, largely motivated by an emotional reaction to a large loss, was perhaps unwise when considered as an isolated incident.\n\nSelling the whole portfolio, at a meta-level, was good. I took a step back from the market, while I was wholly bullish with a large margin of safety on my liquid positions, because my process (endlessly scrolling crypto twitter) was one which removed my own agency and turned me into a reactionary machine largely consuming manipulative and manufactured content. Continuing to benefit from my process, in the long run, was a damaging habit to reinforce.\n\nCrypto is a generational opportunity, yes. But I can’t continue believing that the only meaningful wealth-generating opportunity I’ll ever have is buying cryptocurrencies earlier than the rest of the world. I especially can’t continue living with a scarcity mindset while my thinking isn’t independent and focused.\n\nI need to realize that the world is full of abundance — and that there is essentially infinite opportunity in financial markets alone.\n\nThe goal is to continually increase my capacity for independent action. I focus on the long-term, developing wisdom and refining my decision-making + leadership skills. I anticipate this will be much like the Bible story concerning Solomon: God gave Solomon the choice between wisdom or riches, and Solomon chose wisdom. God was then so pleased that he gave Solomon both.", "timestamp": 1635998742, "digest": "J7t52b7pJiDijT5N1DR7H7mcFEi2tCC6hCmAbQTnEzE", "contributor": "0xdF3AB3adB9F679d71b9A22ab77565b1FF3A5047D"}

The government, \"Ma Bell\", and the NSA were the worry. Most people didn't worry about privacy, anonymity, and security - yet. Still early.\n\nChaum started DigiCash to create 'eCash' - electronic money, backed by cash, on a network connected to a bank. Sadly, Plastic lust and paypal won. \"DigiCash\" was small and centralized, the worst of both worlds, and went bankrupt - 'eCash' died.\n\nThere was b-Money and bitgold but they could be hacked by cheap bots. There was \"e-Gold\", backed by gold, it got big but the Feds crushed it in 2008 - the cypherpunks' worst fears confirmed.\n\nThe big banks and government had an iron grip on networks and money.

I didn't bother sharing that I was helping a local police inspector arrest grey-marketeers either. There would be time afterwords for apologies to the Ambassador.\n\nI went down the elevator to meet with a \"representative\" from the co-op. Yesterday, she and I were trying to kill each other in a restaurant. I walked to the consulate’s lounge.

"        《攻略》一书出版之后，很多读者加入了Larry的微信群，家长们在群里讨论了很多英语启蒙方面的心得，因为Larry的读者群既不推销任何课程、也不安利家长们买任何东西，Larry还时常在群里帮助大家解决问题，所以大家都非常认可读者群的价值。\\\n\n\n        与此同时，众多家长表示希望能得到更具体的指导，大家希望能更具体地了解英语启蒙这条路到底长啥样。家长们的需求是合理的，但Larry自己精力有限，浑身是铁也打不了几根钉，毕竟我是一个人面对一堆人，很难面面俱到...    \n\n        为了让家长们知道英语启蒙到底长啥样，除了《攻略》这本书之外，Larry把Connie从英语启蒙第一天开始，一直到近期（2018年末、2019年初左右）学英语的历程整理了一番，今天这篇文章就是整理的结果。\n\n        现在的家长都喜欢拍娃晒娃，手机里都存了不少自己娃的照片和视频，Larry自己也存了不少，写这篇文字的时候，Larry自己是一边翻老相册、一边整理、一边写，所以这篇手记呢，艺术性肯定没多少，但求给各位家长一份直观的阅读体验，让大家深入了解Connie小朋友从学英语第一天起，一直到后来小有所成的方方面面。这篇文章里有图有文也有视频，限于公众号最多只能发三个视频，Larry把视频剪辑到了一块，放在了本文开头。\n\n        视频里的各个片段大概是Connie在开始英语启蒙后12-18个月的表现，Connie现在的水平肯定比视频里体现的更好，不过Connie最近的表现就不展示了，Larry在这也不是为了秀娃，而是通过这个视频告诉大家，通过合理的英语启蒙手段，在一年到一年半左右的时间内，小朋友大概能达到什么程度的英语水平，让大家心里有个数。\n\n        总之，本文开头的视频乃是英语启蒙的学习成果，Larry在这里可以非常自信地告诉大家，只要大家能坚持住，都能达到类似Connie的英语水平，如果投入足够大，很可能比Connie更好，或者即便比Connie差，差的程度也很有限，而对于英语启蒙路上需要的各种资源投入（包括时间精力投入），看了这篇手记，相信大家都会有详细的了解。\n\n        Larry一向倡导手把手的“教学”方式，《攻略》这本书如此，这篇文章同样如此，Larry希望这篇长文能够作为《攻略》的有益补充，让家长对英语启蒙路上可能会遇到的困难有更明确的认知，如此一来，Larry自己走过的弯路，大家就不用再走一遍了。除了开篇的视频外，本文中出现的照片都是按照拍摄的时间顺序贴上来的，通过观察这些照片，我想大家对Connie学英语的历程会有更加直观的感受。\n\n        OK，咱们开始。\n\n【一切始于2017年九月】\n\n![]()\n\n![]()\n\n![]()\n\n        Connie最开始接触英语是2017年的九月份，我当时萌生了系统地教Connie学英语的想法。平心而论，我自己的英语水平不错，按照网上的揶揄说法，我算得上是普通人群中“英语大神”了，读过我书的朋友们或许无法理解一件事，那就是为什么直到Connie幼儿园大班的时候我才想起来英语启蒙这件事，早干嘛去了呢？原因也很简单，我之前根本没空...\\\n\n\n        我之前是做互联网的（现在也是，不过这是后话了...），2016年底我从上海的互联网公司辞职，回到了福建，在此后两年的时间里，严格来说我一直处于失业状态，个中原因就不细说了，这里头故事太多... 总之，在家里呆着啥也不干肯定不行，人都快呆废掉了，正好我英语还可以，所以我想着干脆带着Connie学英语好了，作为一名赋闲在家的无业人员，这不正好是我力所能及的事儿么？\\\n\n\n        然而看了上面这几张图你就会发现，我当时根本就是在乱教，想到哪教到哪，没任何规划可言。刚刚开始英语启蒙就搞读写肯定是不对的，但我偏偏就这么干了，方法不当也就算了，当时的学习状态也是三天打鱼两天晒网，心情好了就教两下，想不起来的话呢，好几天都可能不碰英语，所以整个九月份下来，Connie的英语依旧是如假包换的零起点...\\\n\n\n        我在《攻略》里面也坦承，自己开始的时候走过不少弯路，我自己并非一开始就掌握了英语启蒙的真谛，然后见神杀神见佛杀佛，Connie的英语从此就上天了... 如果你教小孩学英语的初期遇到困难，不要因此而灰心，因为Larry自己当时也好不到哪里去...\\\n\n\n        经过了瞎搞一通的九月份之后，我开始认真思考英语启蒙这件事，我之前显然低估了这件事的难度，这是一件需要规划的事情，而我之前并没有任何规划。我这人缺点非常多，但我有一个优点，那就是我肯认真思考某个问题，并尝试多种办法。于是，从十月份开始，Connie的英语启蒙计划正式启动！\\\n\n\n        在大学里写论文的话，第一个部分一定是文献综述，说白了就是你这个论文研究的对象，之前肯定有一大堆人已经研究过了，其中不乏很多砖家叫兽大牛，你得先综述下大牛们之前都做了啥工作，先了解大牛们的想法和研究成果，然后再说，好了我这个论文要解决的是某某问题，在众多大牛的研究成果基础之上，我准备如何如何... 这显然是一套合理的逻辑，作为一名拥有烟酒僧学历、熟知论文剽窃技巧的待业人员，我决定先开始英语启蒙的“文献综述”部分。\\\n\n\n        不研究不知道，研究了下还真是吓一跳，英语启蒙产业的混乱状况一点不比成年人英语这行差，各种忽悠、割韭菜、收智商税... 当然了，大牛们的书我该买的都买了，安妮鲜花、廖彩杏、吴敏兰、汪培珽、盖兆泉等一众作者的书我通通读了一遍，读了之后更加感慨这个行业的混乱程度，因为其中某些书里头写的东西那是肉眼可见地站不住脚，但就是这种荒谬绝伦的玩意，当当上也卖出了十几二十万本！\\\n\n\n        在英语启蒙方面，我固然一开始称不上是行家，但我懂得基本的语言学理论，我自己学英语N年，非常了解语言学习的曲线特点，小孩学英语的所谓神奇之处在语言学基本理论里其实有明确的阐述，但其实无论大人还是小孩，都不可能通过“磨耳朵”来学会一门语言，看到市面上大行其道的磨耳朵、英语童谣、自然拼读，我感觉十分无语，这个时候我做了决定：\\\n\n\n        **这些书大部分都扯淡的，英语启蒙这个事儿，还是得哥们自己来！**\n\n        话说得是非常霸气，但其实我真正着手Connie英语启蒙的第一步是比较low的... 我买了几套儿童英语的教材回来，准备先尝试一波教材路线...\\\n\n\n        自己当时拍的照片不知道哪儿去了，放几张网上找的好了，下面这些都是我当时买过的：\\\n\n\n![]()\n\n![]()\n\n![]()\n\n        我后来还买过新概念的青少版等等一堆的材料，不过这是后话，这里就不提，反正买了这些教材之后，我发现这些教材也不怎么样，最后反而是最便宜的、仅仅花了我27块钱的一套盗版《用美国幼儿园课本学英语》让我觉得编排最为合理，于是在学了几天剑桥的教材之后，Connie正式开始学这套《用美国幼儿园课本学英语》。\n\n        英语启蒙，这个说法放在Connie身上并不准确，因为并没有什么启蒙的元素，其实就是普普通通的学英语而已，我最开始对Connie的学习完全是按照传统学英语的方式来要求的，除了不要求读写之外，我要求Connie要记住单词的读音以及意思，同时也要明白句子的意思。\\\n\n\n        是的，按照英语启蒙的原则来说，上面的方法大部分是错的！但凡事不能只看表面，我之所以用传统的方法起步，是因为我从来都认为现行的学校英语教育根本没多大问题，很多人diss哑巴英语，唾弃学校教育体系，那是你自己不够努力好不好？怎么我自己英语就学得挺6，听说读写各方面都6呢？别老说自己学了十几年英语这个那个的，量化成小时2000小时都不到，你学不好英语不是很正常么？\\\n\n\n       ** 从最笨的办法起步，然后逐步调优，这是正解。**市面上流行的理论，哪怕是Larry自己写的《攻略》，大家也不要以为就是最适合自己小孩的学习节奏，每个小孩都是个性化的存在，不可能有某种办法放哪里都灵的。记住这句话：**用最笨的办法起步，然后逐步调优，达到自己家庭内部力所能及的最大化效率。**\n\n        《幼儿园》这套书长这样：        \n\n![]()\n\n![]()\n\n![]()\n\n        小孩用的英语教材，最开始必然都是“123红黄蓝猫狗鸟”这套东西，《美国幼儿园》也不例外，当然，教了忘，忘了教，教了再忘这种无限循环是无可避免的，我为此也和Connie发过脾气，这期间Connie还哭过两回... 至于is，am， are死活分不清之类的问题会让人多郁闷，这方面就不多说了，教过小孩的都知道，反正各种血压升高、情绪崩溃的情景我该经历的都经历了...\\\n\n\n        忙活了一个月，每天半个多小时，终于把《幼儿园》第一本给拿下了，搞定一本书听上去很厉害，但其实这本书很薄，而且后面一大半是词汇表和练习册之类的无意义内容，真实需要学习的内容只有前面的六七十页，加上排版稀疏，加在一块应该也没有100个生词。\\\n\n\n        《幼儿园1》是Connie在我的指导下用最笨、最传统、最没创意的办法学完的，但无论过程如何蠢笨，结果是Connie通过学习这本书具备了最最基本的英语能力：“掌握”了不到100个听力词汇，以及，懂得了最最基本的几个句型（比如 It's a dog, I'm a boy, They are cats之类）。\\\n\n\n        学完了《幼儿园 1》之后，我开始停下来思考如何改进目前的学习方式，改进是必须的，因为当前的学习方式存在问题：\n\n1、学了忘、忘了教、教了再忘的死循环简直是魔咒，无论如何都打不破。\n\n2、输入量不够。作为英语“大神”，我十分清楚**语言学习的本质无非是输入输出的各种训练**，目前的学习方式在输入量方面存在天然缺陷，改进是一种必须。\n\n3、Connie不开心。Connie虽然迫于压力勉强学了一点东西，但这种学习过程是痛苦的，长远来看不利于Connie的英语学习。当然，**完全“无痛”的学习没有必要，也不合理**，世界上没有那么多快乐的学习，郎朗和周杰伦都是“黑暗童年”经历者，但适当降低学习的痛苦值，在一定程度上“减负”依旧十分必要。\n\n        改进是一种必须，但之前这一个月依旧收获巨大，虽然经历的过程又蠢又笨，但如今看来，当初这痛苦的第一个月意义非凡，没有这无聊苦闷的第一个月，就换不来Connie后续在英语学习上的起飞。当然，我不建议大家从一开始就搞这种痛苦学习法，大家按照我改进后的办法搞就可以了。\\\n\n\n        针对上面的几项缺点，Connie后续的英语学习应做如下改进：\\\n\n\n        首先，针对学了就忘这个问题，改进的办法是：**忘了就忘了，不去管它，不强求掌握，只要对学过的内容做到大致熟悉就好**。在整个十月份期间，除了教Connie英语之外，我买了市面上常见的几乎所有儿童英语教材、分级读物、各类绘本等等，在充分调研了这些材料之后，我发现这些材料中词汇的复现率是很高的，即，前面学过的东西即便忘了也关系不大，因为同样的词汇会在之后的内容中反复出现，既然如此，为什么还要追求当下立即掌握呢？忘了就忘了好了，只要不至于全部丢掉，只要能大概熟悉学过的东西，完全可以采用“平推”的策略直接往前走，而不必顾忌忘掉的那些知识点。\\\n\n\n        其次，在输入量方面，我做了两项改进。第一，**全面掐掉Connie的中文动画输入**，光头强和熊大熊二以后坚决不允许看了，只能看英文动画，我挑选了一些语言难度比较低，适合Connie现阶段观看的动画，规定Connie只能看这些动画；第二，后续的学习材料除了《幼儿园2、3》之外，**搭配牛津树作为辅助的阅读材料**，可能的情况下，尽量熟悉牛津树里头出现的生词，将其作为听力词汇来“掌握”。      \n\n【当时给Connie买的分级读物】\\\n\n\n![]()\n\n        除了牛津树之外，海尼曼、兰登、以及一系列其他乱七八糟的分级读物我也买了一大堆，目的就是希望Connie能够在学习之外，增加习得的内容。每天少量的刚性学习内容 + 英语读物习得 + 动画片习得，加上我偶尔和Connie讲一点英语（这个时间不可能很多，小孩要上幼儿园，在家的时间本来就少，而且小孩每天还要干其他的事儿，不可能因为学英语就不玩耍了，事实上Connie每天的玩耍时间一直很多，从英语启蒙开始第一天就如此，现在依旧如此），在我看来应该会取得不错的学习效果。\\\n\n\n        最后，除了上述的“常规处理”手段，我直接和Connie谈了一笔交易，交易的内容就是：我把自己的Mac电脑送给Connie，但是Connie以后要用这台电脑多看英文的动画片，以及，要更努力地学英语...\\\n\n\n        是不是觉得这最后一条听上去特别不靠谱？事实证明这个交易意义巨大！小孩对电子产品其实特别感兴趣，也渴望拥有这种东西，主动送给小孩一件电子产品，小孩是非常开心的，更重要的是，用自己的东西看动画片，和用大人的东西看完全是两码事，前者对小孩来说更有仪式感，小孩子也更容易经常打开“自己的电脑”来看动画，如此一来能更好地辅助英语学习。\\\n\n\n        需要说明一下的是，送给Connie的这台Mac是真的送，也就是说从此以后不经过Connie同意，我不能再使用这台电脑了，电脑的密码被我设置成Connie的名字，我还教会了Connie基本的电脑操作，以后看动画片这件事都由她自己搞定。\\\n\n\n        大家没必要照搬我的做法，毕竟送电脑给小孩这种糊涂事儿会去做的人不会太多，但我个人觉得在学习方面适当给与物质奖励并无不妥，当然，这是个见仁见智的问题，我在这就不跑题说太多了。\\\n\n\n        于是，从十一月份开始，Connie看动画的时间日渐增多：\n\n![]()\n\n![]()\n\n        从十一月份开始，Connie的英语学习方式发生了很大变化，因为不再要求强行记忆，Connie对英语的抵触心理小了很多，加之一台Mac笔记本的收买，Connie开始对英语逐渐建立起兴趣了，除此之外，牛津树的介入也产生了积极的效果，\\<Biff, Chip, and Kipper Stories>的内容远比《幼儿园》来得有趣，Connie经常会在学习之外的时间，自己主动拿出牛津树来看一看，虽然还不认识上面的单词，但仅仅是上面的插图也让她十分感兴趣。\n\n        从十一月开始一直到十二月期间，Connie的英语学习状态可以这样来总结：每天学习时间20分钟到半小时，学习内容有时候是《幼儿园》，有时候是牛津树，每天看动画时间大概在一小时左右（因为光头强被我掐了，所以只能看英文的...），除此之外，如果有空的话，我会给Connie讲一点英文的故事，说是讲故事，其实就是我拿着分级读物给Connie读故事，读的内容可能是牛津树，也可能是海尼曼、兰登等等其他的读物。\\\n\n\n        在这个阶段，我顺利调整了Connie的学习路线，输入量变大了很多，但在输出方面Connie并无太多出彩的表现，我在讲故事的时候偶尔会用英文问Connie一些很简单的问题，Connie会简短回答YES/NO，或者用极其简单的句子来回答（比如 It's a dog之类）， 但整体上来说，Connie在这个阶段并没有达成像样的输出能力，我也没在这方面期望太多，在输入积累还不足的时候，本就不该指望有像样的输出，这方面的基本常识我还是有的。\\\n\n\n        除了上述这些手段之外，为了让Connie尽快完成“原始积累”，我打算每天让Connie掌握一个有代表性的英文句子，所以我自己调研了Connie前期需要看的动画片的台词，以及各类绘本，搞了《一句英语》这个东西，当然了，当时这份材料并没有任何名字，这就是我自己“创作”出来给Connie用的，后来才把这个东西录成课程，取了《一句英语》这个名字。\n\n【当时的笔记截图】 \n\n![]()\n\n        给Connie每天灌输一个句子的意义不仅仅在于“原始积累”，还在于克服母语负迁移。Connie开始学英语的时候已经是幼儿园大班，母语能力已经完全建立，这个时候开始学外语必然会有明显的负迁移问题，这也是为什么英语启蒙最好在三岁左右开始的原因（这个具体就不多说了，大家去看我写的书就好）。\\\n\n\n        在母语负迁移已经是既成事实的情况下（对国内大多数小朋友来说，这是普遍现象），想扭转过来并不容易，所以我给Connie每天安排的句子都有明确的侧重点，有专门针对疑问词的使用、有第三人称单数训练、以及单复数训练等等，以此尽快克服负迁移的影响。\n\n        事实证明，我搞的这一套东西是有用的。克服负迁移是一个长期的过程，小孩不可能立竿见影地把所有毛病都改掉，但《一句英语》在帮助完成“原始积累”以及克服负迁移方面，都起到了不小的作用，最起码加速了这两个目标的达成。\\\n\n\n        上面说了这么多，听上去Connie的学习任务似乎重的很，其实并非如此，当时感觉累的并不是Connie，而是我这个当爹的，因为既要做“文献综述”的工作，做很多调研，思考各种方案的利弊，还要自己看大量的绘本、分级读物、以及动画，抽取其中的句子单词，再改造成Connie能理解的句子，最终整理出一套“教材”给Connie用。Connie的生活倒并没有被英语吃掉多少时间，虽然英文动画看了不少，但这些时间本就是用来看熊大熊二的，不能算作额外的“支出”，Connie的小日子整体来说还是很滋润的，这是当时拍的一些照片：\\\n\n\n【福建的破天气，冬天有太阳的时候不多，天气好的时候赶紧出来耍...】\\\n\n\n![]()\n\n【冬天大多数时候是下面这样的画风...】\n\n![]()\n\n【其实我觉得Connie画画还阔以，对了，下面这个画的是妈妈，也就是我媳妇儿，写轮眼都整出来了...![](https://res.wx.qq.com/mpres/htmledition/images/icon/common/emotion_panel/emoji_ios/u1F602.png)![](https://res.wx.qq.com/mpres/htmledition/images/icon/common/emotion_panel/emoji_ios/u1F602.png)![](https://res.wx.qq.com/mpres/htmledition/images/icon/common/emotion_panel/emoji_ios/u1F602.png)】\n\n![]()\n\n        经过了两个月的学习后，在2018年元旦这一天，Connie画了这样一幅作品：\n\n![]()\n\n![]()\n\n        故事背景是这样滴：我媳妇儿一个同事兼好友元旦这天结婚，发了喜帖，Connie表示要去参加酒席吃大餐，但不好空手去，于是拿一张A4纸画了一幅画作为贺礼...\\\n\n\n        这幅画的特色在于，Connie会的所有知识，都体现在了这幅画里... 有2018（数字）、ABEF（英文字母）、“大人小”（汉字），元素不可谓不丰富... 最重要的是，\"I went to

+ 最基础的若干个句子。\\\n\n\n2、经过了第一个月的阵痛期后，Connie的英语学习计划迭代至更先进的、以大量输入为主（英文动画 + 我给Connie讲一些英文故事 + 自己瞎看）、每日轻量化学习为辅的状态。但必须明确的是，没有第一个月的阵痛期，也很难有后续的转型，大家固然不应该照抄我第一个月的盲目状态，但其中的内核精神值得大家参考，**要记住瞎磨耳朵一定没用，输入也必须是有效输入才行**。\n\n3、头三个月属于打基础阶段，我没有在Connie身上盲目追求连贯的句子输出，她想说就说，不想说就算了，引导固然要引导，但不强求结果，**在打基础的阶段，输出过少或者完全没有输出都很正常，求全责备的心态要不得**。\n\n        时间就这样来到了2018年，一月份里的大事并不是学英语，而是订春运的火车票回东北老家过年。Connie小时候身体不好，东北的冬天太冷，以前Connie很少回去，2018年春节我们准备回东北过，所以整个一月份除了每天学一点英语之外，就是数着日子准备回老家过年。\n\n        相册里翻出了一张我当时去幼儿园参加“开放日”活动的照片，记得当时应该是学期的最后一天了：\\\n\n\n![]()\n\n        接下来是坐火车回家，Connie很喜欢坐火车，因为坐火车可以吃泡面：\\\n\n\n![]()\n\n        在火车上也要看动画片的，英文动画，这是必须的：\\\n\n\n![]()\n\n        我之前的手机相册在电脑里一共备份了四个文件夹：\\\n\n\n![]()\n\n         回东北是带了《幼儿园3》和牛津树回去的，但我找遍了这些相册，也没发现哪怕一张Connie在2018年春节回东北过年期间学英语的照片，这只能证明一件事，那就是Connie在这段时间里很少学英语，或者说我主动教她的时候很少... 看动画片的照片倒是有：\\\n\n\n【Zootopia】\n\n![]()\n\n        我记得当时在东北的时候偶尔也会拿出牛津树或者《幼儿园》教Connie一点东西，但大都是review之前学过的东西，新知识的学习的确不多，相册里留下的照片告诉我，当时Connie基本都是在玩...\n\n【东北特色食品：冻梨！当时是一边吃冻梨一边看动画片】      \n\n![]()\n\n【南方出生的小孩，见到这种大雪当然要出来玩的...】\n\n![]()\n\n![]()\n\n【东北特色食品：蚕蛹！话说我完全不敢吃这个东西，不过Connie觉得这玩意很好吃，正在一边吃一边看动画片...】\n\n![]()\n\n【还有偶尔这种不知道在干嘛的搞怪状态，这一字马也是没sei了...】\n\n![]()\n\n【Connie认为东北烧烤和麦当劳一个级别的好吃，这个评价不可谓不高了![](https://res.wx.qq.com/mpres/htmledition/images/icon/common/emotion_panel/emoji_ios/u1F602.png)】\n\n![]()\n\n【Connie的春联作品...】\\\n\n\n![]()\n\n        在东北呆了一个多月，Connie的生活基本就是吃喝玩乐，这期间并没有保持此前三个月那种强度的英语学习。在东北浪够了，于是准备回家，老婆大人是老师，因为学校开学事情比较多提前回去了，于是我自己带着Connie回家，为了怕Connie走丢，还特意买了一个亲子“手铐”：\\\n\n\n【北京站，作为生活在南方的东北人，这是我造访无数次的中转站...】\\\n\n\n![]()\n\n        终于回家了，Connie的英语学习也逐渐回归正轨，学习之余就是和隔壁的“闺蜜”玩耍：\\\n\n\n【这小女孩住我们家隔壁，她家经营牛肉生意，我们家因此获得了很多免费的牛肉...】\\\n\n\n![]()\n\n        Connie的学习状态回归正轨，但好景不长，回家不到一个月，Connie又生病了，于是我和丈母娘两个人又带着Connie跑了一趟上海...\\\n\n\n【新华医院，这家擅长儿科的医院Connie来过四五趟了...】\\\n\n\n![]()\n\n【西医要看，顺便也看了下新华医院的特色：小儿中医科】\n\n![]()\n\n![]()\n\n        看了病抓了药，启程回家，在动车上动画片也是要看的：\\\n\n\n![]()\n\n![]()\n\n        我一直和家长们说，**Connie的英语是看动画片看出来的**，看了上面两幅图想必大家有些感触吧，关于“看动画片看出来的”这件事儿，我后面还会重复提到的。\\\n\n\n        从上海回来之后，Connie的生活恢复了往常的状态，不过因为肠胃不好的关系，她需要在一定程度上忌口。话说Connie从小就挺可怜的，吃一块糖果就可能咳嗽不止、感冒发烧，其他的零食也不怎么敢吃，否则肠胃就可能出问题，在东北的时候吃一顿烧烤都要小心翼翼，后来Connie长大一些就好多了。Connie小时候经常看着别人家的小孩吃零食流口水，自己想吃又不敢吃，真是太让人心酸了...\\\n\n\n        我一直在微信群里和家长们说，我对Connie真的没什么很高的期望，我就希望她能一直健康，一直开心，一些家长可能以为我是故意玩低调，其实还真不是，我想任何父母都和我是一样的，如果自己的小孩从小体弱多病，那么让孩子健康快乐就是最大的期望，其他一切额外的东西都没什么好计较的。\\\n\n\n        2018年三四月份，从这两个月开始，我加大了Connie每日的习得输入量，因为Connie对英文故事越来越有兴趣，我每天会抽出更多时间来给她讲故事，为了保证Connie每天都有新鲜的故事可以听，我还买了全套的《图书馆》和\\<I Can Read>这两套分级读物。\\\n\n\n        之前和大家解释过了，所谓的讲英文故事，其实就是照书念，大人或许觉得这件事无聊的很，但小孩子是真的喜欢，Connie更是乐此不疲，《图书馆》里有一些故事书比较厚，这些故事Connie暂时还听不太懂，但她依旧要听，尤其喜欢各种王子公主的戏码（小女孩的通病...）。我尝试过给Connie讲故事的时候同时做录音，结果一篇故事讲下来，整整十五分钟，连续十五分钟嘴动个不停，讲完之后嗓子都在冒烟儿，这活儿还是比较累人的，谁讲谁知道，重要的是一个故事还可能不够... 但为了Connie能学好英语，哪怕累一点我也会给Connie多讲几个故事，而且相比妈妈对孩子的付出，其实我这个当爸的也没做什么，也就是讲几个英文故事了...\\\n\n\n        因为已经有了一定量的输入积累，加上我平时经常给Connie用英文讲故事，Connie在这个阶段开始自己“讲”故事了，关于这一点我在《攻略》这本书里提到过，这里放一张《攻略》里出现过的一张图：\\\n\n\n![]()\n\n        大家可以对照上面的图看下，Connie自己开始“讲”故事大概就是2018年三月份开始的。为了不误导大家，我在这张图里面并没有加入Connie之前走过的“弯路”部分，比如《幼儿园》的学习、以及第一个月里面Connie经历过的“痛苦学习”部分，**这些都是我自己走过的弯路，大家不应该照单全收去模仿**，所以其实这张路线图体现的是修正后的“正确”路线。\\\n\n\n        我给Connie讲故事，以及Connie自己“讲”故事，这两件事我可以详细和大家说下当时的细节。一般是Connie先去她自己的书架上去选书，她一般一次会拿七八本，有时候甚至是十几本书，然后我们俩就坐床上，Connie开始分配任务，她会把书分成两堆，她自己喜欢的放一堆（这是她自己要“讲”的），她自己相对不喜欢或者她喜欢但根本看不懂却又想听的，放成另外一堆，这些是我要讲的，然后就开始讲故事，我和Connie轮流来，我先讲一个故事（一本书），然后Connie“讲”，以此类推，直到两堆书都讲完为止（其实有点累人...）。\n\n        我讲故事的方式就是正规的读故事，书上写了啥我就念啥，有时候我翻页的时候Connie会按住不让我翻，因为她要“消化”这一页的内容，一般是因为插图没看够想多看一会儿。这里要说明下，虽然小孩并不识字（至少是认不全的，不论中英文），但小孩对待插图的态度十分认真，我经常发现Connie会看出某些插图的细节，而这些细节都是我忽略掉的，想必拿着绘本给小孩讲过故事（不论中英文）的家长们都深有体会。\n\n         我讲完了一个故事，就轮到Connie来“讲”了，之所以是加引号的“讲”，是因为Connie的英语程度根本无法支撑她自己认读上面的英文句子，所以Connie其实是瞎讲一气，很多时候嘴里冒出来的东西根本和书上的内容丝毫不相关，甚至有时候会冒出一个我昨天教过她的《一句英语》里的句子来充数，让人哭笑不得，我对此的态度是放任不管，但如果她输出的句子里有语法错误，我会指出来，要求她重新说一遍，如果依旧说错，就暂且放过，但如果后续再次出现同样的错误，我依旧会指出她的错误，要求她重新说，关于这一点，在《攻略》中有关“通知”的技巧方面有详述，这里就不赘述了。\\\n\n\n        “讲”故事完全是Connie自己的发明，我对此抱着乐见其成的态度，因为我知道学外语既要有足够的输入量，又要有一定的输出锻炼，以及，在学习初期，学习者的输出一定会掺杂着大量语法错误，这些错误乃是必然，小孩绝不可能立马就改掉这些问题，改正这些问题是一个长期的过程，需要多方面联合解决，只要后续保证足够的输入量（语法正确且地道的足量输入，比如看动画），辅以每日的轻量化学习，甚至在合适的时间点引入语法教育，语法错误并不是问题。\\\n\n\n        开始的时候是Connie缠着我和她一块玩“讲”故事的游戏，因为我可以辅助Connie来“讲”故事，在她“讲”不出来的时候，我会提点她一下，给她帮个忙，让她能顺利“讲”下去，但有时候我也没空陪她玩，所以后来她干脆就自己“讲”，经常自己抱了一摞书坐在床上瞎“讲”一气，我也不去打扰她，由她自己玩得开心就好，虽然看上去有些好笑，但这也是相当不错的输出训练。\\\n\n\n【Connie的专属书架，这些并不是Connie全部的英语读物，我自己的书架上还有好大一坨...】\\\n\n\n![]()\n\n        除了上述的变化之外，这期间我做了对于Connie的英语学习来说十分重要的决定：指定\\<Reading A-Z>（RAZ）作为Connie后续的主打教材。\\\n\n\n        之所以做出这个决定，原因是多方面的。首先，Connie的听力词汇积累速度让我不够满意，虽然在一般人看来Connie的学习进度已经很快，但我十分清楚，小孩学外语的潜力绝对不止如此，之所以词汇积累还不能令我满意，我认为是当前的主打输入内容，牛津树，的锅！\n\n        牛津树是非常非常非常优秀的一套读物，一连三个非常，可见我有多认可这套读物，但**牛津树最大的缺点是它也仅仅就是个有趣好玩的读物而已，用它来入门的确蛮合适，但用来系统提升英语水平、夯实英语基础的话，它完全不合格**，因为它除了有趣、好玩之外，基本上毫无体系可言，具体牛津树的缺点有哪些，我在《攻略》里面都有详述，这里就不多说了。\\\n\n\n        其次，Connie需要一个**学习路线的参照系**。学习路线的参照系，这话貌似有点让人听不懂，但说白了其实意思就是：\\\n\n\n        我们现在习惯把小孩学英语叫做英语启蒙，但其实也就是第一年可以算作是所谓的“启蒙”，后续就不能叫启蒙了，应该叫学习了，那么问题来了，小孩完成了英语启蒙的第一年后，应该达到什么水平？之后又学了一年，应该达到什么水平？如果一直学到小学毕业，又应该达到什么水平？以及，假设以小学毕业作为关键节点的话，那么从英语启蒙开始一直到小学毕业的这六七年、七八年、甚至10年期间，我如何才能知道我的孩子在某个时间点上，达到了应该达到的水平呢？如果我一直用牛津树，是不是牛津树学完了，就宣告成功了？那如果我用海尼曼呢？或者是培生呢？如果牛津树、海尼曼、培生之类的学完了还不够，我的小孩后续该学啥？甚至还可以问得更精细：不管是牛津树、海尼曼、培生，还是其他任何分级读物，多久之内学完算合格？\\\n\n\n        类似上面这样的问题会有一大堆，要知道我已经是所谓的英语“大神”了，都会有这么多问题，如果是普通的英语小白家长，遇到这类问题绝对会直接崩溃，当然，足够小白的家长可能连想到这种问题的思维都不具备，那问题就更严重，因为这种家长根本就没规划、没目标，这种学习肯定会一直原地打转，很难取得进展。\\\n\n\n        上面这些问题让我意识到，我需要一套真正的教材，这套教材必须具备如下特点：\\\n\n\n1、词汇丰富。这一条之前解释过了，就不赘述。\n\n2、体系足够庞大，能够支撑Connie从当前水平开始，一直到小学毕业阶段的学习。\\\n\n\n3、分级明确，有级可依。所谓的分级明确，不单单是你一套读物分了几个级别就算完事了，你得告诉人家到几岁了，应该读完学完什么东西，达到什么样的水平才算数。这一点RAZ是做到了的，RAZ对于分级以及每个级别相应应该达到的水平是有明确规定的，具体来说长这样：\n\n![]()\n\n        上图是网上随手down下来的，这张图的右侧，也就是“中国”的部分大家可以无视，RAZ照这个办法来学完全没意义，大家直接看左边的“美国”部分就好了，当然，左侧的美国部分也和我记忆中RAZ对应的美国孩子的水平能力略有出入，我印象中的要求更严苛一点，这张图大概比美国孩子的水平落后了一年左右，不过这也没什么不好，因为我本来就觉得**对标美国同龄孩子的水平并不现实，落后一到两年才是更现实的方案**。\n\n        刚刚提到了“分级明确，有级可依”， 指的就是上图左侧部分的对照标准，按照这个标准对标美国孩子的标准来学就可以了，当然，即便达到了美国同龄孩子的阅读进度（单单指RAZ而言），孩子真实的英语水平和英语为母语的小孩依旧是不能比的，大家要记住一点，**对标美国标准，不等于达到美国水平**，有些事情本来就是难以做到的，庸人自扰毫无意义，如果能在小学毕业之前解决掉RAZ，你家小孩的英语水平绝对是秒杀同龄人的存在，达到这种水平已经非常非常足够了，后续孩子的英语学习也绝对会一骑绝尘，永远领先下去。\n\n        一些对英语启蒙了解较为深入的家长可能会问了，为什么没考虑其他的美国原版教材呢？Wonders 不是很好么？为什么不用呢？\n\n        事实上，我调研的还不止 Wonders 这一种原版教材，Wonders、Treasures、Journeys、Storytown、Scott 等等一堆的教材我都要么买到手、要么下载了电子版调研了一大圈，调研的结果是我认为上述这些教材都不适合Connie来使用，原因也非常简单：这些教材的体系有些过于庞大！\\\n\n\n        刚刚提到的这些教材大都有语文”、“科学”、“数学”等等明确的科目分类，简而言之就是，书的数量多、分类多、学起来消耗的心思精力也多！如果学这类教材，你需要时刻保证各个科目都处于相同的进度，总不可能“语文”学到了三年级了，“数学”还停留在一年级呢，直白一点说，普通家长面对这种教材根本无从下手，说句自夸的话，连我这样的英语“大神”都觉得太麻烦，可以想象普通小白家长面对这种教材的无助状态。\\\n\n\n        类似 Wonders 这样的分科目的原版教材，其实比较适合国际学校作为标准教材来适用，而不适合普通家长用来给孩子做英语启蒙。RAZ是不分科目的，或者说它直接把所有科目统统捆在了一块，这样的“无脑”体系对于国内普通家长来说更容易执行。\\\n\n\n        于是，在2018年三四月份期间，RAZ成为了Connie的主要学习内容，而牛津树则变成了娱乐项目，彻底沦为“讲”故事的材料。这期间Connie每天的学习安排大概是这样的：上午去幼儿园，每天中午幼儿园放学之后，利用吃饭之前的时间在家学习15-20分钟的RAZ，然后吃午饭，午饭之后自己随便耍一会，然后选择午睡或者看动画片（有时候她躺着那磨磨唧唧的实在不肯睡，你也没办法对不对...），下午继续在幼儿园度过，晚上放学回家之后，晚饭之前再学习15-20分钟的RAZ，晚饭之后搞什么节目不好说，有时候逛超市，有时候去蓝鲸乐园（听名字就知道是游乐场...），有时候和隔壁小朋友玩耍，有时候看动画片，总结一下就是：每天两段固定的学习时间，这个是定时定点定量的，除此之外的习得输入就难说了（看动画、讲英文故事等等），有时候多，有时候少，有时候完全没有，不过总的来说看动画的时间还是蛮多的，在我的印象里光是《狮子王》Connie就看了不下50遍，台词都快给背下来了...\\\n\n\n        学了一小段时间RAZ之后，因为此前的输入积累已经不少，加上我平时有意引导，Connie在这个期间开始主动说英语了，当然，她说的英语经常有不少的语法错误，说出来的东西常常是broken English，但我很清楚这是个好兆头，只要保证后续的输入量，Connie听说水平的建立只是时间问题。\\\n\n\n        关于口语这件事情，我在这里有必要和大家多啰嗦几句：\\\n\n\n1、Connie是先有听，后有说，不止是Connie，所有的小孩都是这样的，因为这就是原本的、正确的、符合人类天性的语言学习路线。成年人学外语另说，听说读写一起上也没问题，但对于小孩来说，听力水平的建立永远是第一位的，没有听懂，就没有表达，所以大家一定不要整天担心所谓的口语问题，只要小孩听力水平达标，哪怕两年都不开口说一个单词都不是问题，因为，**有听就有说！****反之，听力输入不够，或者听力水平太差，口语绝不可能好！**\n\n2、**沉默期这个东西，可信可不信**。《攻略》中对于沉默期这个概念有过一些论述，这里就不说太多了，在这里我想和大家说的是，对于沉默期这件事，大家应该抱有的态度是：如果我的小孩开口了，那沉默期就是扯淡！如果我的小孩还没开口，那就是还在沉默期...  \n\n3、口语是一种衍生副产品。在中国学英语，无论大人学还是小孩学，不要追求所谓的口语好，你追求这个，那你就什么都得不到。因为我们生活在中国，你无论怎么追求，也不论你花多少钱，你终究换不来纯正地道的纯英文自然语境，这意味着大多数时间里英语学习者（不论大人小孩）接触最多的永远是文字材料（绘本、分级读物、英语教材等等）+ 多媒体材料（动画、美剧、电影等等），这意味着最经常接触的永远是阅读和听力这两个场景，至于口语，你找谁说找谁练？父母老师亲戚朋友同学舍友同事里头，你周围有几个能和你说英语的？至于老外，你一年见几个老外？**学习任何东西，一定要确保自己的学习方法足够接地气，不要搞任何看起来高大上、实际上却飘在云端、无法落地的玩意**。搞好听说和阅读，口语自然会有，而如果只盯着口语看，你最后什么都得不到，不管大人小孩，这一条通通适用，因为这是真正符合国情的学习路线。\n\n        经过2018年前面三四个月的学习，Connie学会了500个以上的听力词汇，具备了一定的输出能力，但这种输出是有瑕疵的、仍需改进的，在这个期间Connie对英语已经产生了比较浓厚的兴趣，每天学英语对Connie来说再不是一种负担，在正式的学习之余，Connie自己也会把“讲”英文故事和看英文动画作为娱乐活动来对待，习得程度因此得到了深化，以上可以看做是对Connie这一阶段英语学习的总结。\n\n        相册里翻出一张超有趣的照片，是2018年5月3日这天拍的：\n\n![]()\n\n        忘了当时是淘宝了什么东西来着，这张退货卡片被Connie拿去玩了，然后Connie要求我在上面写了图上的那些字，Connie口述，我来写：\n\n*我想要一个最棒的东西*\n\n*那就是爱和朋友*\n\n*我想学各种文化*\n\n*每个东西都不一样*\n\n*我自己想学英语*\n\n*没有人能阻挡我*\n\n        让人忍俊不禁的一段表达，来自即将从幼儿园毕业的Connie，虽然好笑的很，但从这段话里可以看出Connie对英语的态度。如果每个小朋友对待英语都能有类似的态度，学英语这件事就会简单许多，但是大家不要忘了，正如我在《攻略》里面提到的：**真正的喜欢，一定是建立在水平之上的**，Connie并不是从一开始就喜欢英语的，这个世界上并没有那么多快乐的学习，该吃苦的时候必须得吃苦。只要水平稍微提升上来，英语是很容易建立兴趣的一门技能，而如果水平一直在低位徘徊，英语绝对是世界上最让人讨厌的东西。\n\n        对英语启蒙这件事来说，除了要规划明确外，我觉得**家庭内部的“文化环境”也是重要因素**。我这人缺点多多，但姑且还算是个“读书人”（偶尔会抽些时间读书的人... ），老婆大人“读书人”的属性比我弱一点，但她是中学老师，案牍工作十分繁重，很多书不想读也得读，作业不想批也得批，所以从Connie的角度来说，爸爸妈妈经貌似经常在看书写字什么的，小孩总是喜欢模仿大人，于是：\\\n\n\n![]()\n\n![]()\n\n        一个幼儿园小屁孩，你拿《红楼梦》出来装样子就算了，旁边还放个鼠标这是什么造型... ![](https://res.wx.qq.com/mpres/htmledition/images/icon/common/emotion_panel/emoji_wx/2\\_05.png)![](https://res.wx.qq.com/mpres/htmledition/images/icon/common/emotion_panel/emoji_wx/2\\_05.png)![](https://res.wx.qq.com/mpres/htmledition/images/icon/common/emotion_panel/emoji_wx/2\\_05.png)\n\n        我并没有因为自己是“读书人”就觉得Connie以后肯定学习成绩特别棒，我压根没这种奢望，但家里的“文化环境”对Connie学英语起到了积极作用，这个是真真切切的。**想要让孩子有看书的习惯，最容易的办法就是大人自己多看看书，如果自己实在没时间看书，偶尔装个样子也行**，哪怕你看的是网络小说，但你买套实体书看，装个样子，绝对比你天天在孩子面前盯着手机看有意义得多（自我表扬一句，我从来不是那种整天手里捧个手机、其他啥都不管的人，我也不喜欢和这种人做朋友）。\\\n\n\n        得，跑题了，还是说回英语这个事儿。如果大家读过我写的《攻略》这本书，就会明白我一直强调的路线是每日的“轻量化学习” + 大量习得，本文之前的部分也一直在强调这些，除此之外，我想额外讲一下关于如何学字母的问题。\\\n\n\n        26个英文字母？这不是随便学两下就手到擒来的东西，还有必要专门讲这个？事实上，还真的很有必要讲一下26个字母到底怎么学的问题，因为很多家长对这个问题真的很懵圈... 认为这个东西十分好学、手到擒来的，那你肯定没教过小孩，甚至没养过小孩...\\\n\n\n        首先要明确一件事儿，那就是：**26个字母并不好学**。你觉得字母好学，是因为你已经会了，好比你认为20以内的加减法特别简单，但你指导孩子写作业的时候还是会气出心脏病来，因为那玩意对小孩来说并不简单，而且，你也好，我也好，咱们小时候其实都笨得要死，类似于20以内加减法，26个字母这种东西，其实对小朋友来说是很有难度的。\\\n\n\n        明确了26个字母并不好学这个事实后，还要接受另外一件事儿：26个字母这种基础性的玩意，对初次接触的小朋友来说，属于既无规律也没趣味的无聊东西，想记熟26个字母，还要区分大小写，本身难度就很大（不信邪的家长，你自己去找一份日语五十音图，看看自己多少天能背下来并熟练默写，你会发现自己可能连小孩都不如... ），而且最无奈的是，除了机械记忆之外，并没有其他什么好办法，至于某些机构也好，线上课程也好，搞那种除了letter name还要记忆letter sound的鬼把戏，把字母学习和自然拼读混在一块搞的，通通都是扯淡，并不适用于零起点的小孩，总之一句话，**26个字母除了死记硬背根本没别的办法！**\n\n        明确了上述两点，攻克26个字母的路线就很明确了，应该采用的办法是：**每天学一点点（机械的东西，多学也没用，因为转过头就忘） + 每日极少量的机械记忆学习和复习（多了小孩肯定不耐烦）+ 不厌其烦地一点一点磨。**\\\n\n\n        从英语启蒙第一天开始，Connie就学了字母，从本文开头的第一张照片大家就看得出来，不过当时的学法完全是“描红”，根本记不住任何东西，我本来以为字母这么简单的东西应该随便就搞定了，没想到直到Connie听说方面都已经小有所成了，26个字母还写不全呢，而且大小写经常分不清，你如果考她默写的话，比如w怎么写，Connie要从A开始数，一直数到w才能写出来，而且有时候还能数错...\\\n\n\n        有了这些经历之后，我对字母学习转变了态度，干脆每天拿出3-5分钟专门练习字母，听说读写全都上，翻来覆去地搞，反正每天就那么几分钟，Connie也并不至于嫌烦，说起来大家可能不信，就这26个字母，Connie差不多学英语学了大半年才真正记熟了...\\\n\n\n        总结一下，关于字母学习，大家应该记住这样几个原则：\\\n\n\n1、四岁以下的孩子不建议一开始就学字母，即便要学，也不应该追求过快的学习进度，无论多慢都是可以接受的，哪怕花费了一整年才学明白，也完全没问题。\n\n2、字母真的不简单，不要以大人的标准去要求小朋友，永远记住，你小时候十有八九还不如自己的娃呢...\n\n3、字母学习可以和英语启蒙同步进行，也可以不同步，因为英语启蒙第一年主要是搞听说，26个字母并不是太重要的内容。\n\n4、对四岁以上的小朋友来说，我建议大家从一开始就把学习字母表列为每天的学习内容（否则等真正需要用的时候，才发现孩子完全是“文盲”... 那个时候再开始学有些来不及），哪怕每天就学一个字母，哪怕一个字母学好多天，哪怕每天就学一分钟，都是没有问题的。\n\n        总之，对待字母学习这件事，用不着过于认真，看下Connie就好了，Connie以前会这样：\\\n\n\n【看《跳跳蛙》】\n\n![]()\n\n        照片里Connie在看《跳跳蛙》，一边看一遍装模作样地拿出纸笔，对照着动画片上教的拼读知识自己也跟着写，我并没有让Connie这么干，完全是她自己摆的造型，但其实这种无意识的学习效果往往更好，不是死记硬背能比的。\\\n\n\n        家里当时在墙上贴了一块软磁性白板，买了配套的字母模型，每天用这个来教Connie认字母，当时没拍照片，我淘宝上找了一张图，大概长这样：\\\n\n\n![]()\n\n        我家里的情况和这张图的区别在于：我家那块白板比这个黑色的难看许多，我家的装修也没人家这个房子漂亮... ![](https://res.wx.qq.com/mpres/htmledition/images/icon/common/emotion_panel/emoji_ios/u1F602.png)![](https://res.wx.qq.com/mpres/htmledition/images/icon/common/emotion_panel/emoji_ios/u1F602.png)![](https://res.wx.qq.com/mpres/htmledition/images/icon/common/emotion_panel/emoji_ios/u1F602.png)  \\\n\n\n        经过了2018年前面三四个月的学习，Connie已经有了还算凑合的英语基础，平心而论，和其他零起点开始学英语的小朋友相比，Connie取得的学习成果已经算得上很棒了，但我对Connie的学习进度并不满意，不满意的原因有两个：1）Connie从幼儿园大班才开始学英语，其实已经错过了3-4岁的启蒙黄金期，假设Connie从三岁开始学英语，那现在的水平已经很好了，但Connie恰恰错过了黄金期，为了弥补启蒙过晚的问题，我认为Connie需要开小灶补课；2）Connie目前的英语学习在输入方面主要依靠教材（RAZ）、听英文故事（我给她读分级读物）、以及自己看英文动画片，这三者当中价值最高、营养最丰富的的无疑是英文动画片，但问题恰恰在于以Connie目前的听说水平（主要是听力），很难从动画中吸收到足够的营养。\\\n\n\n        OK，明确了原因，找到主要矛盾的主要方面就容易了，结论就是：当前主要的矛盾是Connie过低的听力水平与英文动画所要求的高听力水平之间的矛盾，制约Connie的英语水平进一步发展的，是Connie目前过于落后的听力水平，只要解决了这个问题，那就解决了几乎所有问题。\\\n\n\n        那么接下来就要探讨如何提高听力水平的问题了。**对于成年人来说，提高英语听力水平是极难、极难、极难的事情！**很多人以为口语提高很难，其实他们都是小白和外行，**成年人学英语，最难的地方就是听力！**想翻越听力这座大山，需要付出的努力远超你想象，我自己学英语的经历绝对可以写成一本比《攻略》厚十倍的书，但只要你解决了听力问题，口语能力自然会达成一大半，还是之前说过的那个逻辑：**先有听，后有说，有听就有说！**\\\n\n\n     **   这里也给一些想要提高自身英语水平的家长们提个醒，别老是口语口语口语的，你盯着口语看，你就什么都得不到，你想想看，连美国英国的新闻都听不懂，就想着如何能口语666，这有可能么？****打通了听力，你才真正地拥有英语，否则啥都是白搭。**\\\n\n\n        大人搞定听力十分艰难，但幸运的是，小朋友搞定外语听力要比大人简单许多，至于个中原因是什么，语言学家也没整明白呢，所以咱们也别咸吃萝卜淡操心，只要知道这件事对小孩来说不那么难就行了。\\\n\n\n        小孩提高听力水平固然比大人来得容易，但本质依旧需要经历“**大量输入→消化吸收→继续输入**”这样一个反复循环的过程，对成年人来说，提高听力大概有“精听”和“泛听”两个手段（听写其实属于精听），我自己一直是精听派（我并没有说泛听没用... ），我自己当年攻克听力就是通过海量的精听练习来达成的（泛听在我看来生效太慢），一些家长朋友可能不太理解精听和泛听有啥区别，其实一句话就能讲明白：**精听要求学习和吸收听力材料中的每个词，连同标点符号在在内的所有东西，你都得整明白；****泛听则是听完就拉倒，听不懂的就算了，并不针对听不懂的部分做额外的努力。**\\\n\n\n        英语启蒙阶段的英文动画输入，其实本质上是一种泛听行为，泛听的优点有很多，比如方便执行、心态轻松、场景要求宽松（坐公交地铁的时候都可以听）等等，但泛听有个最大的弊端：起效太慢。\\\n\n\n        基于以上种种理由，我决定给Connie“填鸭”。《攻略》出版之后，很多家长在微信群里问我有关“填鸭”的问题，他们有些搞不懂“填鸭”的意义，鉴于我在《攻略》里面针对“填鸭”已经有了大量论述，这里就不赘述太多，我用两段话来解释“填鸭”的意义：\\\n\n\n1、**“填鸭”本质上等于“精听”**，而精听是提高听力水平的重要手段，只要听力水平提高了，读写和口语都很容易解决。总之，要时刻记住，**不管大人小孩，英语学习听力第一，其他都是次要的。**\\\n\n\n2、“填鸭” = “精听”，这个解释过了，而之所以要执行“精听”，是因为Connie平时已经有了足量的“泛听”基础（看动画、讲英文故事等等），**对于小孩来说，光搞“精听”绝对是不行的，先不论这其中的科学性如何，小孩本身的个性就不可能喜欢“精听”这种无聊透顶的学习方式，所以，必须是“泛听”（看动画片） + “精听”（“填鸭”）才有用。**\n\n        OK，除了刚刚说的这两点，我在这里必须再次无比郑重地对读到此文的家长朋友们说一句：**“填鸭”不是必须的**，个中原因是什么，我在《攻略》里面有详细的论述，这里就不多说了。\n\n        于是，从2018年五月份开始，Connie的“填鸭”学习正式开始，正如在《攻略》里面提到过的，我挑选的材料是\\<Bubble Guppies>这部动画片的台词，因为网上找不到现成的字幕文稿，我只好自己先听写下来，这是当时的笔记截图：\\\n\n\n【\\<Bubble Guppies>第一季第一集台词，我记录下来的文稿一共是1440个单词】\n\n![]()\n\n【第11集，我只记录了6个单词】\n\n![]()\n\n【第14集，只记录了44个单词，如果不是为了掌握整个句子，记录下来的单词肯定只有几个而已】\n\n![]()\n\n        对照上面几张笔记截图，大家可以发现Connie的进步是很快的，事实上正如我在《攻略》中提到的，经过了五六集动画台词的“填鸭”之后，后面其实都会变得比较轻松。\\\n\n\n        经过了“填鸭”整个阶段后，Connie的听说水平有了很大提升，在这个阶段Connie的口语输出逐渐从碎片化的broken English提升至质量更高的表达，语法错误也少了很多。\\\n\n\n        Connie的“填鸭”学习大概执行了三四个月，原则上是每天都执行，但实际上并没有做到一天不落，有时候是隔天，有时候几天才有一次，而且每次“填鸭”完一集动画台词的文稿，还要反复看好几遍。“填鸭”这件事听上去有些霸道吓人，但实际上Connie却挺喜欢的，因为经过她的讨价还价之后，“复习”某一集动画也变成了所谓的学习时间，所以很多时候Connie只要看一会动画就算完成了当天的学习任务（看之前“填鸭”过的某一集动画），如此一来她还是很乐意的。\n\n        针对“填鸭”这件事在这里就不多说了，毕竟《攻略》里已经讲了很多，配合这篇文章中的描述，相信大家应该能搞明白“填鸭”到底是怎么回事了。\\\n\n\n        时间就这样来到了2018年的暑假，Connie也正式从幼儿园毕业，马上就要成为小学生了，这一年的暑假我们最终决定回东北老家耍。\n\n【在火车上看牛津树】\n\n![]()\n\n【动画当然更是要看的...】\n\n![]()\n\n【东北平原，怎一个“平”字了得...】\\\n\n\n![]()\n\n        和上次春节的时候回东北一样，我在相册里依旧没找到暑假期间哪怕一张有关Connie学英语的照片，可见这个暑假学英语的时间依旧不多，四处玩耍的照片倒是翻出了一大堆：\\\n\n\n【吃喝】\n\n![]()\n\n【玩乐】\n\n![]()\n\n【莫莫格自然保护区的丹顶鹤】\n\n![]()\n\n【在自然保护区也得吃...】\n\n![]()\n\n【接着吃...】\n\n![]()\n\n【感受下东北餐馆的菜量，脸盆差不多大的盘子...】\n\n![]()\n\n【Connie和爷爷奶奶】\\\n\n\n![]()\n\n【捉蜻蜓】\\\n\n\n![]()\n\n【各种捉其他小动物...】\n\n![]()\n\n        在东北浪了一个多月之后，一家三口人又回到了福建，等待Connie的是我预先在网上订购的一堆英文读物：\\\n\n\n![]()\n\n        其实写到这里，这篇《Connie的英语启蒙手记》已经可以结尾了，因为2018年暑假过后Connie的听说水平已经相当不错，在家里和我用英文对话已经成为常态，从2018年下半年开始，Connie的听说水平慢慢就提高到了本文一开始的视频中的状态了，至于这期间的学习状态，一句话就可以概括：每天RAZ + 看动画片。\n\n        作为看官的你可能有点不理解了，怎么前面还说Connie一直说得不够流畅、语法错误多什么的，这就一下子就飞起来了涅...\n\n        飞起来固然不至于，Connie说的英文还是经常会犯一些小错误，但这根本不是问题，要知道这么大的孩子即便说母语也经常会犯错，Connie就经常说出类似“今天的饭太盛丰了！”之类让人哭笑不得的句子，其实这些都不是问题，只要后续保证足够的输入量，口语上的些许小错误慢慢都会解决掉的，而Connie之所以在2018年下半年达成英语学习的“飞跃”，是因为之前的输入积累已经足够，尤其是每天的动画输入，我在微信群里一直和家长们说，Connie的英语其实就是看动画看出来的，翻开之前的手机相册，Connie看动画时拍的照片最多，一边吃东西一边看动画，是Connie最重要的娱乐项目之一：\\\n\n\n【一边吃香蕉一边看】\n\n![]()\n\n【生病发烧了也看...】\n\n![]()\n\n【这个造型奇葩的气球我记得要20块钱！】\n\n![]()\n\n【功夫熊猫配鸡腿...】\n\n![]()\n\n        如果你读过《攻略》这本书，搭配这篇对Connie英语学习历程的回顾（全文两万字... ），想必对小孩如何学英语这件事一定有更深的理解了，在本文结尾之前，再和大家额外强调两件事，分别是关于母语负迁移导致的语法错误的解决办法，以及自然拼读的问题。\n\n        首先，对于语法错误的问题，小孩学英语，一定会犯很多语法错误，关于这一点我在《攻略》中已经提到过如何对付这个难题，除了《攻略》中提到的办法之外，我想额外提醒大家的是：**习得固然非常有用，也能解决很多问题，但不要迷信习得的作用，该“学习”就一定要学，该训练的时候也一定要训练！**比如：\\\n\n\n【Connie的语法考卷】\n\n![]()\n\n【读写训练，说白了就是背单词...】\n\n![]()\n\n        上面第一张图上的语法题目是我出的（一部分句子是我自己造的，还有一些是动画台词改编的），目的就是针对Connie的语法进行训练，习得固然有用，但有一部分“痼疾”并不是仅仅依靠习得就可以百分百解决的，阶段性的搞一搞专项训练，把传统学校学习的那一套拿出来，其实是十分管用的。大家一定要足够客观、足够理性地看待传统学校的外语教育，不要一提到学校英语教育就嗤之以鼻，**传统的办法固然缺点很多，但优点也不少，对于小孩学英语来说，在传统的老办法中“择其善者而从之”绝对是有必要的！**\n\n        说完语法错误的问题，我还要提一嘴自然拼读的事儿。《攻略》中对自然拼读的论述已经非常多，我在这里要和大家额外说的是：**自然拼读是一件非常不重要的事情，这个东西早学或者晚学，甚至极端一点说，学或者不学，影响并不大**，因为英语是拼音文字，只要打通了听说，读写自然就有了，自然拼读只不过是连接二者的桥梁，就其本身来说，自然拼读并没有什么真正的价值，即便小孩完全不学拼读规则，只要听说能力达到一定的水平，再辅以相应的阅读训练，自然拼读很可能“不小心”就自然掌握了大部分。总之大家要记住，**自然拼读不重要，听说是根本，而听力是根本的根本，听力过关了，读写和口语都不是问题，大家从英语启蒙第一天就要牢记：听力第一！**\n\n        OK，这篇文章该结尾了，其实在我看来，教Connie学英语这件事最有意义的地方并不是Connie学到了多少英语知识，而是通过这件事我成为了一名相对更合格一点的爸爸：\\\n\n\n![]()\\\n\n\n        机缘巧合之下，我出版了一本书，很多家长因此都觉得我是个模范爸爸 + 模范丈夫，这距离真相非常遥远... 我们家最不可或缺的人是我丈母娘，她外出一个星期，家里吃喝拉撒全乱套，整个家庭直接陷入无法运转的状态... 第二不可或缺的人是我媳妇儿，她既要照顾自己班级的几十号学生，又要照顾Connie，既要辅导Connie写作业，又负责带Connie出去各种玩，相比之下我对家庭的照顾是很不够的，奈何只因为我出了一本书，好名声让我一个人全占了，当然，这个社会就是这样，名气大的人不见得有多少斤两，辛勤付出的人却往往无人问津，我姑且也算是一个例子吧... 对了，你可能要问了，怎么没提泰山大人呢？因为他和我一样，在家里的存在感都比较低... ![](https://res.wx.qq.com/mpres/htmledition/images/icon/common/emotion_panel/emoji_ios/u1F602.png)![](https://res.wx.qq.com/mpres/htmledition/images/icon/common/emotion_panel/emoji_ios/u1F602.png)![](https://res.wx.qq.com/mpres/htmledition/images/icon/common/emotion_panel/emoji_ios/u1F602.png)\n\n

{"id": "nMorJW9NUt8LYShYArfz3j60NbnAJQRQh93xqvnXt-k", "title": "random thoughts on crypto", "body": "本质上来说，中本聪发明的区块链技术，提供的是一个全球范围内的，对数字内容的所有权确权，转移，清算的基础设施。这确实是革命性地解决了数字内容能被轻易复制的问题。比特币以太坊为代表的一系列项目，使得全球有可观的一群人理解了区块链的概念，相信并接受了在区块链上流转的数据的所有权+不可复制性。在这个基础设施上，币圈建立了一个庞大的有不同分工的虚拟经济体系，**其实本质很像是一个全世界一起玩的，以金融为主题的，在线虚拟游戏。**\n\n在以前这样一个游戏要在全球范围内普及，\n\n1）要很强的剧情/玩法驱动才能在全球范围内快速传播和保持热度，而区块链提供的是“赚钱”这个永恒普适主题，加上了不少高科技的背景色彩，这就比中国炒邮票/藏獒，欧美炒名画要更加简单，更加符合新一代年轻人的需求。\n\n2）要跨国超主权建立起来便捷的经济流通和交易体系，而区块链有互联网就可以做到。\n\n3）要保证玩家的虚拟资产所有权，对游戏运营方的诚信和能力有很强的要求，而区块链是去中心化自组织的。\n\n在这个社会游戏体系里面，NFT就很好理解了，其实就是特殊的skin/avatar，可以表示social status。想想看我们在CS里面愿意为一把独特的刀（并没有实际效果）付出多少钱。游戏中有专门的一大类付费道具叫做Pay to be Cool。\n\n现在NFT头像主要是对拥有者提供一种社会认同，这和名表/豪车/藏獒等任何收藏圈是一样的，只是数字化了，有足够多的人接受这个收藏品价值的narrative，并且能保证稀缺性就可以。这其实和8888的车牌/手机号码比较贵是一个道理，是一种verifiable scarcity的展示。因此投资域名出身的蔡文胜对这个事情肯定是很理解的，而关注实际使用价值的投资人肯定会感到不解。\n\n在这个游戏体系外的人看游戏中的价格，和游戏中的人看是不一样的。几百个eth换一个punk在外人看不可思议，其实放在游戏的经济体系，只是普通道具换/合成高级道具的逻辑，尤其是一些早期玩家已经积累了大量普通道具。只是这个游戏的道具和实际货币兑换比其他游戏容易多了。\n\n很多人是冲着赚钱效应进来这个游戏，而没有花时间建立和游戏中早期参与者类似的心理寄托，对游戏里面的内容缺乏认同感（这种认同感可能就是通过大起大落产生的），当然会觉得这个游戏的参与者都疯了。没玩过魔兽世界的人肯定对一件极品装备的价值是缺乏认同的。\n\n如果把区块链理解成一个游戏的话，一定要把游戏中的内容和现实世界结合起来产生某种程度上的应用，这可能就意义不大了。游戏本身就很有价值，没必要一定要对应到现实世界，类似魔兽世界里的神兵利器，也不用在现实中有什么作用。\n\n在这里面倒腾道具能不能赚钱呢？当然是可以的，实际上游戏圈有不少人就是这样发财的，在一个更大尺度，更多人参与，更好流动性的游戏里，当然更加可以。但是不是VC适合做一个投资游戏道具的基金呢？这个是存疑的。至少如果把这样的基金说成是和投资互联网公司一样、我很存疑。比如说博闻做的Defi fund，有些类似一个基金专门从游戏中以一种稳定的方式（比如说种田挖矿）来获得金币。只要大家能持续把金币换成钱，那确实这个基金是可以赚钱的。\n\n区块链这个基础设施是很强大的，但是也不要过度神话它，把它说成包治百病。这个游戏什么时候会出问题？我认为是流动性出问题，导致大家对“这个游戏里的道具可以换钱”产生怀疑的时候。这个很可能最后还是来自于监管，毕竟如果让一群游戏中早期获得大量道具的人变成世界上最有钱和能量的人，这不是一个负责任的政府想看到的。如果你知道游戏里面的道具可能有一天不能兑换成钱了，那挤兑可能就免不了了。\n\n如果一个游戏全世界有大量的人或多或少在玩，这其实就是一个metaverse的雏形。好比假设中国人80%都是魔兽世界的玩家，那游戏中的公会就能起到某种程度上的社会治理作用，游戏中的经济系统就能某种程度上成为一套alternative 经济系统。比如说有小国家宣布用比特币作为法定货币，说实话一个大规模游戏中的货币，比如说另一个例子是Robux，可能就是比一个不靠谱小国家的货币更具公信力和价值。\n\n形成这样一个Metaverse，对各国政府来说可能都是很可怕的，我觉得很大概率会形成一个全球主要国家政权联合去绞杀的局面。", "timestamp": 1636003285, "digest": "ms8xKZ5AGP0EJK99E4CGQXkv3n0PM-UykLYS72VVZgg", "contributor": "0xB2de2F8Da855CC511382Cd329Dcb3395213EC48C"}
{"id": "OA9iRZLUOhnLLSwCMY-cORLLpey3QXRxmLZ_tQuZPEE", "title": "Urban renewal analogies for web space", "body": "During the vaccination phase of the pandemic someone very close to me fell into a pit of links and mailing lists. I had understood, abstractly, that misinformation and conspiracies breed in the Venn overlap of wellness and isolation, but I hadn’t appreciated the real-life costs and anxieties that are the result. It doesn’t just stay anon.\n\nAs if we hadn’t already known, whistle-blower Frances Haugen’s patient explanations of algorithmic devilry depict a Facebook business model that puts fractions of percentage points of profit before community safety \\[1\\]. Haugen recognises the real-life consequences of misinformation, having been initially motivated to work at Facebook after her close friend was radicalised on the platform. \n  \n As much as misinformation is a problem in English speaking communities, Haugen explains, there are other more extreme concerns for human safety. Facebook subsidises the web in places where a free and open internet does not exist, and only a handful of languages have AI safety ability; programming a new language for safety and integrity does not make economic sense in societies with smaller numbers of (usually) less affluent users. The common knowledge that a lot of what’s on the web is untrue is not necessarily known in all communities. The ethnic violence in Myanmar and Ethiopia, fanned by social media groups, is just the beginning.  \n  \n Haugen describes how Facebook rhetoric promotes a black and white choice: *we can either have oversight or we can have privacy.* But this is a false choice. It’s not a problem of dangerous content, it’s a problem of the structures and rules / algorithms of the platform.\n\n Seemingly minor changes that Haugen claims could make a difference in limiting the spread of malicious materials (and reduce clicks / eyeballs / profit by small fractions of percentage points) include:\n\n* refining the algorithms to cap the number of invitations to a group a member can issue (embedding a **human scale**)\n* requiring links to be copied and pasted after a certain number of reshares (introducing **friction** to decisions) \n* capping the dominance of ‘extreme users’ (those who engage with the platform the most, often in anger and anxiety) in training the algorithm that influences what other users see (introducing a **mediating** factor) \n \n\nNotwithstanding Facebook’s recent offensive to claim the metaverse, this *is* a time for reworking the web. What began as information (Web1) and expanded into interactive content creation (Web2) is in desperate need of governance and civility. Some accountability can be achieved through code-verified decentralisation (Web3), but, even in a world where an individual’s human existence and their online actions and ownership can be proven by a 42-character Ethereum address, the public space of the web remains an under-realised and sad reflection of a community’s values.\n\n### Metaphor and analogy have value in helping the collective reworking of the web.\n\nMetaphor and analogy are methods of sense-making – ways of *framing and acting in the unknown* \\[2\\]. The practice of sense-making generates findings useful for others, outside of the case-specific or technical detail. Synthesising the explanation so that it makes sense to others has an *intersubjective* intention, that is it focuses on the capacity of people to understand each other. Sense-making is the application of discursive and relational techniques of communication; naming, distilling, abstracting and repackaging, including through stories and metaphors, continually redrafting the collective story and the ‘best available’ explanation.\n\n### Public space is a useful web analogy.\n\nEli Pariser is co-director of [New Public](https://newpublic.org/), a group with a mission to *understand what common characteristics make for “public-friendly” spaces, that valorise the collective and that are designed for the greater public good*. Much like Haugen, Pariser takes issue with the structure and governance of the web rather than the content. It’s not an information problem, it’s a problem of human relationships, trust, connection, the structures of the bonds that the information flows through. Pariser argues that the way platforms create online spaces should intentionally learn from urban spaces that are optimised for cooperation and connection. Cities are full of strangers interacting, often without danger. Pariser talks about the *civic signals* – those features that constitute the critical qualities of flourishing public spaces, and that ‘script’ human behaviours, both in real life and online \\[3\\]. Civic signals include the scale of public / online spaces, features that script behaviours and connections, the ‘soft’ architecture of programme, and governance, agency and ownership *(how and by whom are behaviours set?)*\n\n### My own job is in urban design. So here are four more urban renewal analogies through which to consider the web space:\n\n1. **Place activation**  \n Curated place activation brings public life to a place in its early evolution, before a critical mass of population ‘activates’ it organically. This includes everyday and night programme, seasonal events, and temporary programme that targets specific user groups within the community. Paid ‘place managers’ have a coordinating role, but the events themselves are decided through stakeholder engagement (within the community) and through expressions of interest by external partners. To accommodate this range the structure of public spaces should be simple and flexible rather than complex. For web, this analogy illuminates the role of planned activation rather than simply letting the space fill organically, especially in the early days of a platform / group / protocol.\n2. **Funding** \n In urban renewal, those who benefit from the uplift in land value contribute financially to the upgrades required to support the growing population. For example, a residential tower development will pay a fee per apartment as a contribution to funding needed community infrastructure - parks, public spaces, street upgrades. For web, this analogy questions the mechanisms for contributing to and determining infrastructure priorities as a platform grows.\n3. **Safety, diversity, inclusion** \n Universal Design is the design of places and products to ensure inclusion, regardless of ability. It is distinct from accessibility because inclusion is integrated from the outset. Universal Design is the welcoming address, not the ramp added on the side. Other measures of safety and inclusion in physical public spaces are the *social field* (a scale at which people can see other people - increasing perception of safety) and *walkability* (describing - obviously - distance plus environmental comfort). For web, these features can be analogies to consider details of scale, access, user experience that support expression and connection and limit danger.\n4. **Long term view**  \n Finally, there is the factor of time. Improving public space and safety is not wholesale reworking but long-term and incremental renewal by many hands that takes time. It’s an ongoing job, not something that can be fixed once, rebuilt, and then disregarded, it won’t ever be complete or perfect. But, as Haugen says, *we shouldn’t be afraid of trying to make a problem 80% better just because we can’t make it 100% better.*\n\n\\[1\\] Frances Haugen, 2021,  <https://www.franceshaugen.com/blog/b9xlswihkike7639nn4ie23odz9eqy> \n  \n  \\[2\\] Deborah Ancona, 2012, Sensemaking: Framing and acting in the unknown, in *The handbook for teaching leadership: Knowing, doing, and being,* Sage \n   \n \\[3\\] New Public, 2021, *Civic Signals: The qualities of flourishing digital spaces*,  <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lO4skPVekwciJGFYxxJBIBitFzzDSC0zL1-AvhgfeNs/edit#slide=id.gaae01eb308_1_81>", "timestamp": 1636003204, "digest": "PcDYvJIhXdIK_e_MMpcD0MfeRAB0ja72_c2m1VXf8CE", "contributor": "0x5a13E93873A51Fcb8C6417e8A15D8111250d3B14"}

北京报道\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/klIE8FQUisVRzxv5AzPvT.jpg?height=4608&width=3456)\n\n李泽厚是谁？\n\n据说有一年李泽厚南下，去某大学附近的书店作客。老板在门口贴了一张不起眼的告示，引得诸多学子停步注目。他们兴高采烈，奔走相告：李泽楷要来了！\n\n一位学者在听到这个段子后感叹，“一瞬间，我感到了世事的苍凉。想当年，李泽厚是何等了得啊！八十年代的大学生、研究生，有几个不知道李泽厚的？就连他那本其实没多少人读得懂的《批判哲学的批判》，也是许多青年学子的架上之书、枕边之物。”\n\n李泽厚曾说，1990年代是“思想家淡出，学问家突显”。在新世纪已经五年的今天，大概是学人淡出、商人突显了。将李泽厚错认作李嘉诚之子、小超人李泽楷，这是时代的悲哀还是进步呢？\n\n想当年，李泽厚初出茅庐就一鸣惊人，在1956年的美学争论中，26岁的他发表《论美感、美和艺术》一文，提出美是“客观性和社会性的统一”，批评了当时鼎鼎大名的美学家朱光潜和蔡仪的观点。\n\n在此后的反右和文革中，政治的惊涛骇浪波及中国绝大部分思考着的头脑，而李泽厚却几乎没受影响。在太行山下放、在“五七干校”劳动，当有的同事忙着做家具的时候，李泽厚却用红宝书蒙着康德的著作，搞自己的哲学研究。\n\n1970年代末百废待兴，李泽厚的作品有如横空出世。从哲学、美学到思想史，他横跨多个领域。从思想到语言，都是一种崭新的面貌。\n\n《批判哲学的批判》这一纯哲学著作，当时竟然卖了3万册。而三部(古代、近代、现代)思想史论更是影响深远。李的思想洞见和文字魅力在《美的历程》一书中表现得淋漓尽致。该书1981年出版后，十年之内印了八次，成为最畅销的学术著作，甚至成为一个时代的标志，被冯友兰先生高度评价，是对中国美学、中国文学，以至于中国哲学最精练浓缩的概括。\n\n这本1979年的作品，丝毫没有革命八股的文风。即便今日看来，文字依然珠圆玉润。光是标题，便气度不凡：龙飞凤舞、青铜饕餮、魏晋风度、盛唐之音……\n\n有人宣称，以七七、七八级本科生和七八、七九级研究生为代表的一拨人是“读朦胧诗和李泽厚长大的一代”。\n\n高尔基曾这样评价叶赛宁：“与其说是一个人，倒不如说是自然界特意为了诗歌，为了表达无尽的‘田野的悲哀’、对一切生物的爱和恻隐之心而创造出来的一个器官。”《原道》主编陈明套用这个说法，认为李泽厚“也是上帝赐给中国的，进行思想的器官，为了感受时代的气息、脉搏，把它彰显放大”。\n\n李泽厚似乎总是能把握住思想文化的历史脉搏，引领学术界的目光投向一个又一个新领域。1980年代后的“美学热”、“文化热”，都与李泽厚有关。可以说，他在这十年间中国思想文化的进程中留下了自己明显的烙印。\n\n李泽厚告诉记者，他的所有书都有盗版，即便如此，著作收入也超过100万了。也许李的思想仍然有人质疑，但其在思想启蒙方面的覆盖力，恐怕不亚于正统的教科书。\n\n在1980年代，李泽厚是时髦。但世移时易，有人认为李泽厚过时了：1989年写《华夏美学》的他已是“日薄西山”。而1996年的《世纪新梦》更是“老态毕现”。\n\n李泽厚的思想究竟会在历史上占据什么位置，恐怕今人无权置喙。口无遮拦的他对记者说，“有人说我已在美学上远超朱光潜，哲学上远超冯友兰。我心里倾向接受，口头却连说不敢，我还没想清这到底是我的谦虚还是虚伪。”“对我的评价，可能要在我死后30年或50年。”\n\n李泽厚1992年1月去了美国。每年回国一次。在异国他乡教书8年，现已退休。1980年代如众星捧月般的他，1990年代给金发碧眼的年轻人讲授中国的孔子和康梁，不知是怎样的一番滋味。\n\n当学问家取代思想家，当新左派和自由主义者闹得不可开交之时，一个远离中国、远离学术圈的老人，偶尔也会超然世外地说些真话。2002年，李泽厚和陈明的对话录《浮生论学》出版，因为臧否了不少今人，惹来非议。\n\n11月的深秋，李泽厚身着睡衣，在家里接受了本报记者的专访。当他谈起世界和历史，一种孤高而强大的自信折射出背后庞大的思想支撑。当他用湘音聊起老长沙的旧时风貌，一种温暖的气氛烘托出这位老人的恬淡心境。\n\n李泽厚曾说“走自己的路”。在他看来，自己的人生际遇与反右、文革一样，都是社会大潮的起伏而已，而只有自己的思索一直闲庭信步，节奏未曾改变。正如记者几次要求，他依然穿着睡衣拍照。\n\n下面的对话，大部分都是常识。恐怕只有清醒而“不懂人情世故”的老人，才能说出这些明白而不拐弯的实话。\n\n## 访谈\n\n记者：我们的报纸提倡理性、建设性，据说您很早就有类似的提法，能不能讲一讲？\n\n李泽厚：我在1980年代有过类似说法。对五四运动，我曾评价为，理性不足，激情有余。这八个字是我曾在纪念五四运动时写的。\n\n现在有股潮流，有批人物，否定五四，觉得五四斩断了中国的文化传统。这个观点我是非常反对的。但我认为五四有很多缺点。\n\n学术界流行尼采和后现代。现在把尼采捧为学术偶像，我是不赞成的。我认为，破坏一个东西不大难，但建设一个东西却不那么容易。而人类社会是靠建设而不是靠破坏来维持其存在的。毛泽东说，先破后立，不破不立，主要是强调破的方面。实际上立比破要难得多，破了不见得立得起来。\n\n比如写学术文章，以前我说过，你指出哪个人的文章有一二三四五错误，那不太难，但你要想就这个问题提出自己的一点真正的建设性意见，就不容易。小到写文章，大到一个国家和社会的成长，建设是重要的，所以我很赞成你们报社的这个提法。\n\n一个很有名的知识分子跟我讲，知识分子的任务就是批判。似乎一考虑建设，就是想做帝王师。这个看法是不对的。这个立场在欧美可以，因为这些社会的资本主义已经很稳固了，你怎么批判也没什么关系。欧美一些知识分子做的事情就是批判，他们不管建设不建设。譬如福柯，就是反对理性，认为理性是囚笼、启蒙是错误。但是，对中国，特别是目前的中国来说，更需要理性的、建设性的东西。这一点我1999年也讲过了。\n\n20世纪70年代末80年代初，我在一篇文章中说，马克思主义不仅是批判的哲学，也应该是建设的哲学。过去一讲到马克思主义，修饰语就是批判的、革命的。但我认为，马克思主义应该也是建设性的。怎么样建设一个好的社会，精神方面、物质方面都有许多问题值得探讨研究。\n\n所以，我很赞成理性、建设性。这不是奉承你们的报纸。当然批判也应该是理性的，但现在流行的是非理性、反理性。\n\n记者：记得您说过，在不同社会阶段，需要的思想是不一样的。欧美的社会制度发展已经比较成熟，所以需要福柯这类批判思想。但在中国现在这个阶段，后现代这些东西是不是远远超前于现实了？\n\n李泽厚：这是一个复杂的问题。一个思想的作用要放到具体的社会环境里去考查。\n\n西方的资本主义发展了几百年，理性的东西相当周密。美国的法律多如牛毛，法律就是理性的具体表现。而理性，特别是工具理性，在中国是太少了。而在西方，却是工具理性太多，把人都捆起来了。所以，他们需要破坏和解构。中国恰恰相反。学者们要模仿、要接轨，把后现代硬搬过来，在基本学理上是有问题的。当然，后现代作为一种现象，为什么和如何可能产生，这倒值得研究。\n\n我想可能有这个原因：主流学者不是讲“历史的终结”嘛，历史终结，便不需要革命了，激情也没有了，过一种平平淡淡的生活。有些人感觉极不满意，有各种虚无和自我暴弃。\n\n但是，就中国社会而言，大部分人仍然没有过上好的生活，大量农民工还在为生存拼死拼活。所以，这些思想就和时代脱节了。其实，就算在资本主义国家，也有贫富悬殊问题。不然法国哪有那么大的骚乱，也是因为那些移民的第二代受到歧视吧。\n\n讲后现代的人，很大部分是学院里的教授。一些人大肆赞美非洲的原始部族。有学者说，那你干吗不把自己的孩子送到非洲去？为什么自己不去那里生活？\n\n后现代思潮实际上是在学院里，并不是发达社会的思想主流，社会的主流还是非常理性的。\n\n现在西方最时髦的就是后现代，要赶时髦，才能接轨嘛。学术和科技不一样，科技当然最时髦的就是最好的。学术却不一定。现在的理论不一定比柏拉图好到哪里去。后现代的这些代表人物反对理性、反对启蒙。但他们其实并不比康德、洛克、休谟强到哪里去。福柯、德里达这些人，我觉得比马克思差远了。\n\n记者：您仔细看过福柯、德里达吗？\n\n李泽厚：当然，只看过一些，但他们的基本思想我知道。比如福柯，我认为比较精彩的是，他说知识是与权力联系在一起的，任何一种知识都是被权力支配着。这是有道理的，甚至某些自然科学，都是被某种权力支配的。没有什么真正超脱的知识，没有与政治无关的真理。但是，马克思的思想里早就包含着这一点。其实，福柯他们受马克思的影响很深，但他们不愿意讲。海德格尔也是这样。\n\n福柯的其他主张，比如理性是监狱等等，我以为，学术价值并不高。\n\n记者：您的思想的两个基点，是不是马克思主义和儒家经典？\n\n李泽厚：一个是马克思，不是马克思主义。因为马克思也说他自己不是马克思主义者。哈哈。另一个是中国传统。我是在中国传统的基础上融化康德和马克思。我也吸收了不少后现代的思想。例如，后现代思潮反对绝对的、先验的理性，反对像康德、黑格尔那样的理性。我提出的实用理性，恰恰也是反对绝对先验的理性。我认为理性是从经验中提升出来的。这些方面便和后现代有吻合之处，或者说吸纳了他们的一些东西。又如，我反对他们的相对主义和反二分法，却又强调“度”的灵活性和不确定性，等等。\n\n记者：从计划经济到市场经济，中国的物质生活是朝向欧美那个方向。在精神文化层面上，中国是不是缺什么，怎么解决？比如中国人是不是需要宗教？\n\n李泽厚：这个问题太大了，不好谈。刘小枫说，五四时代的一个最大错误，就是没有把基督教搬进来。所以他希望基督教来救中国。但我的看法是，在基层，特别在农村和下层社会，基督教可能会有很大的传播。但要中国知识分子普遍接受基督教，是比较困难的。\n\n我也说过，在美国上课时，有个学生问我，你们中国人不信上帝，怎么还能维持那么久呢？他很惊讶。这是一个很好的问题。汉族发展到今天这么庞大的规模和人口，是一个奇迹。\n\n原因之一，我在最近的一个文章中讲，是因为中国有个“礼教”，儒家的教。它不信上帝，也不拜孔子。但是，它拜五个字：天地国亲师。我记得小时候，家里的堂屋供奉着祖宗牌位，后面的红纸上写了五个大字，天地国亲师。这就是中国的宗教，拜的就是这个东西。原来是天地君亲师，辛亥革命以后就改成天地国亲师了。国是国家，亲就是长辈和亲戚。中国的礼教，是一套行为规则，一种伦理规范，一种情感信仰。所以，我讲中国礼教的特点是宗教、伦理、政治三合一。\n\n三纲五伦，这就是中国的宗教，是和伦理、政治相结合的一个东西。但是，这个传统也丢掉了。\n\n过去的这个传统是有经济基础的，祠堂、宗祠有田，由族长来支配钱怎么用，或者办学，或者在饥荒时义赈，救济灾民。现在这些都没有了。\n\n在新的形势下，我们怎么来应对？假设我们从外面借一个宗教比如基督教或伊斯兰过来，可能性不大吧？！能否和怎样创造一种新的形式，回到中国人过去那种天地国亲师的信仰(而非政治或伦理)状态？这是中国文化要解决的大问题。\n\n到现在为止，中国还是人情味比较浓的一个社会。注重家庭生活，尊敬师长、长辈，注意各种亲属关系，和别的民族还是不同。比如打工妹赚了钱，还要寄回家，很顾家的。这在西方是不可能的。这说明什么？说明还是存在某种传统。不能说基础牢固，但场域尚在，还有可为。在这个基础上怎么发展出信仰？学者要思索，也要做一些社会调查，还要政治家的努力。这是很艰巨的事情。\n\n记者：这和您说的“西体中用”有关系吗？\n\n李泽厚：大有关系。关于西体中用，我已经写了很长的文章，不再重复。简单说两点。所谓西体就是现代化，这个现代化是从西方引进的，不是讲改革开放嘛；“体”是指社会存在。西体是指社会存在和日常生活的现代化。这才是真正的人类本体。这和我说的吃饭哲学是联系在一起的。这个“体”，不是虚无飘渺的中国精神、文化传统、精气神啊什么的。\n\n第二，我的这个西体中用是针对中体西用而言的。中体西用来自张之洞，其主要目的就是维护封建专制主义。没有中体西用，我也不会说西体中用。而中用，是西方的一套搬到中国来后的应用。中国用西方的体，会创造出新形式。所以我说转换性创造。从而，这个体也就并不完全等同于西方的那个体了。这个问题讲起来很复杂，详细的可参看我的《再说西体中用》一文。\n\n记者：上海7月份开设了首个中小学生诵经班，辅导他们学习《三字经》、《千字文》、《百家文》等儒家启蒙经典。请问您对儿童读经运动有什么看法？\n\n李泽厚：我并不反对读些经典，不然我写《论语今读》干什么。但要看你用什么思想来指导读经运动，是国粹主义、复古主义、保守主义？这些我是反对的。\n\n记者：您刚才说到中国礼教的特点，是政治、宗教、伦理三合一，这出自您对巫的理解吧？现在年轻人的思维结构，完全是西方现代科学那一套。而西方概念体系和中国传统是搭不上界的。比如哲学、宗教，中国过去都没有这些完整的概念。但您是从根子上思考，建立了一套概念体系。\n\n李泽厚：我就是从根子上找。例如，为什么中国人说天人合一？这在西方是不可能的，因为上帝和人是绝对不同质的。你只能皈依上帝，请上帝赎你的罪。你不能和上帝变成一体(除了某些异端派别)。中国的主流，儒家、道家都讲天人合一。这是哪里来的？就是我说的巫史传统。似乎别人还没这么说过。\n\n记者：周公和孔子发挥了巨大作用。\n\n李泽厚：我认为周公、孔子、秦始皇，是对中国历史影响最大，也最重要的三个人。\n\n记者：秦始皇为什么了不起呢？\n\n李泽厚：我以前没有讲过，我不是研究历史的，发言权不够。\n\n秦始皇统一中国是了不起的事情。而且，他搞了书同文等等。汉字在维持中华民族的延续、发展和统一方面起了极大的作用。我认为，汉字并不是口头语言的复写，和西方语言完全不同。但我不是语言学家，这只是我的一个看法。但我觉得这个看法很重要。\n\n汉字怎么来的？来自结绳记事。所以汉字具有神圣性、可崇拜性。我小时候，经常看到墙上贴着一张纸，上写“敬惜字纸”。一张白纸，写了字，就应该爱惜它，尊敬它。没有汉字，中国很早就分成很多个民族国家了，就和欧洲分成那么多民族一样。\n\n而且，汉字控制着语言的发展，而不是语言控制文字的发展。在西方恰恰相反，是语言控制文字的发展。要英国教授看懂11世纪的英文，那是不可能的事情。但我们可以看懂孔子、孟子的东西。文字有这么强的持续性，语言受它的控制。\n\n除了书同文，秦始皇还有汉武帝把六国开始有的郡县制给统一化、制度化了，建立了文官制度等等。这也很了不起。中国的基础都是秦汉时打下的。\n\n记者：记得您讲过，在地方和中央的关系上，您还是倾向于中央集权？\n\n李泽厚：1990年代我和很多朋友争论时说过，中央集权很重要，不能搞地方分权。中国最可怕的是内战。如果地方分权，每个地方都有个军区支持它，那湖南和广东就可以打仗了。我们这么大一个国家、统一市场，多好。欧盟就是想搞个统一市场啊。\n\n什么事都有利必有弊。中央集权当然有弊端，但比分权可能带来的四分五裂好得多。\n\n这个方面我和很多人看法不一样。有人提倡地方自治，我是不赞成的。可以搞试验，但如果发展趋向与中央对立，那就麻烦了。\n\n记者：哪些方面可以分，哪些可以统？您能不能讲得细致一点？\n\n李泽厚：我是搞哲学的，只能说个大概。经济上、政治上，哪些该分，哪些该统，那是我无法发言的。但我当年就赞成宏观调控，1990年代初吧。辛亥革命最大的问题，就是把中央集权的象征打掉了。后果一定是军阀混战。\n\n记者：您似乎对民族主义比较反感。\n\n李泽厚：民族主义，是很危险的事情。今天在世界任何地方都要反对民族主义。民族主义是最容易煽动民众感情的一种主义。如果有人鼓动，我们和日本打一仗，那一定是许多青年人争先恐后。现在之所以不能搞议会、多党制，原因之一是打民族主义大旗的政党一定优势胜出。这是非常危险的。\n\n现在学术界也有某种民族主义思想，包括我的一些学生、朋友，我是不赞成的。10年前不是有本书《中国可以说不》，我非常反感。现在也有一种情绪，认为21世纪就是中国的世纪。我也不赞成。这是一种莫名其妙的自大。不管哪个方面，科学、军事、技术、政治、文化以及经济，我们比西方都差一大截。所以我最讨厌豪言壮语。这方面我和很多人讲不来。我认为这种姿态容易误导民众。如果号召和日本或美国打仗，那一定热血沸腾，群情激奋，极不理性。\n\n记者：有很多学生游行抵制日货。这个算不算民族主义？\n\n李泽厚：我觉得，政府和学者应该注意这个问题。\n\n但我也一再说欧盟是个榜样，那么复杂的情况可以走到现在这样密切的经济联系，这才是世界真正走向大同的路径。不同文化、不同宗教、不同语言、不同传统可以联合在一起。现在不能想象法德再打仗了。也许30年后俄罗斯也会进去。为什么？因为经济的力量。\n\n对台湾也是，经济力量才能让它不和大陆分开。这就是我的马克思主义，这也是我的吃饭哲学。我说的吃饭，包括衣食住行、性健寿娱，指整个生活质量的不断上升。这个力量是最大的。\n\n人首先是一种物质性的生存动物，我不欣赏那些大讲精神至上的人。我故意用吃饭哲学这个词。有人说庸俗、粗鄙。我就是要它来刺激那些蔑视物质生活的人。你再不庸俗，也要吃饭，而且都想吃点好饭。除了印度的苦行僧。\n\n记者：能不能对自己做个评价？\n\n李泽厚：近两年已经有好几位这么问过我了。我对自己不好作评价，让时人特别是后人评价吧。我总不能像牟宗三说自己的“古今无两”吧，有人说我已在美学上远超朱光潜，哲学上远超冯友兰。我心里倾向接受，口头却连说不敢，我还没想清这到底是我的谦虚还是虚伪。我又想为什么近来老有人问这问题，我想我大概是快死了。\n\n记者：您提了一些概念，如实用理性、乐感文化、一个世界，都很独特。您的这套概念能够在中国和西方的思想之间搭一座桥，是不是可以这样理解？\n\n李泽厚：我抓了一些根本性的问题。这样才能真正走进世界，和西方沟通。从王国维到冯友兰、牟宗三，都是走向世界，我希望将来能走进世界。\n\n我这些概念，不仅中国可以用，将来西方也可以用。比如我的实用理性，当然要很长一段时间以后。对我的评价，可能要在我死后30年或50年。呵呵。\n\n记者：您在和陈明的对话《浮生论学》中几次提到，中国学术界应该重视分析哲学。我也感到，许多人用同一个词，但却是不同的含义，这样讨论问题就容易南辕北辙了。\n\n李泽厚：现在很多人不注意这个问题，经常一篇文章内自己的话有矛盾。其实一直有这个问题，当年讨论形象思维就是如此。现在的文风也不好，学后现代，搞得晦涩难懂，可以清清楚楚讲的，故意曲曲折折、模模糊糊。\n\n记者：对目前国内学术界的主力军，您有什么评价？\n\n李泽厚：在1979年的《古代思想史论》后记中，我说希望属于下一代。我希望能“为王先驱”。\n\n我希望这些年轻人能出一些非常好的作品。我当时说，红卫兵一代搞自然科学是没有希望了。但我希望在人文学界、政治方面出一些有作为的人。包括文艺界，我希望出一些大家。20多年过去了，我对此相当失望。\n\n最大问题是原创性不够，都是转述、模仿。根本性的创造太少。当然也不能胡乱创造。\n\n记者：到现在，您的著作总共印了多少册？\n\n李泽厚：我没有数。我所有书都有盗版。这些书好像还是学生买得多。因此盗版书都集中在学校区域。书有人看就好，可惜错字太多。我的书在台湾卖得也不错，例如《美的历程》，这个没想到。这大概是我的惟一安慰。\n\n记者：为什么一直有人看呢？说明一直没过时。\n\n李泽厚：不随风倒。现在讲华伦斯坦、白银经济等等，我就不信。我以为，不论做事或做学问，重要的是要有自己的判断。我一向说，判断能力比知识重要。到底哪个对，哪个错，对几分，错几分，自己要有判断。现在很多是人云亦云，赶时髦，追风。",

访谈\n\n记者：我们的报纸提倡理性、建设性，据说您很早就有类似的提法，能不能讲一讲？\n\n李泽厚：我在1980年代有过类似说法。对五四运动，我曾评价为，理性不足，激情有余。这八个字是我曾在纪念五四运动时写的。\n\n现在有股潮流，有批人物，否定五四，觉得五四斩断了中国的文化传统。这个观点我是非常反对的。但我认为五四有很多缺点。\n\n学术界流行尼采和后现代。现在把尼采捧为学术偶像，我是不赞成的。我认为，破坏一个东西不大难，但建设一个东西却不那么容易。而人类社会是靠建设而不是靠破坏来维持其存在的。毛泽东说，先破后立，不破不立，主要是强调破的方面。实际上立比破要难得多，破了不见得立得起来。\n\n比如写学术文章，以前我说过，你指出哪个人的文章有一二三四五错误，那不太难，但你要想就这个问题提出自己的一点真正的建设性意见，就不容易。小到写文章，大到一个国家和社会的成长，建设是重要的，所以我很赞成你们报社的这个提法。\n\n一个很有名的知识分子跟我讲，知识分子的任务就是批判。似乎一考虑建设，就是想做帝王师。这个看法是不对的。这个立场在欧美可以，因为这些社会的资本主义已经很稳固了，你怎么批判也没什么关系。欧美一些知识分子做的事情就是批判，他们不管建设不建设。譬如福柯，就是反对理性，认为理性是囚笼、启蒙是错误。但是，对中国，特别是目前的中国来说，更需要理性的、建设性的东西。这一点我1999年也讲过了。\n\n20世纪70年代末80年代初，我在一篇文章中说，马克思主义不仅是批判的哲学，也应该是建设的哲学。过去一讲到马克思主义，修饰语就是批判的、革命的。但我认为，马克思主义应该也是建设性的。怎么样建设一个好的社会，精神方面、物质方面都有许多问题值得探讨研究。\n\n所以，我很赞成理性、建设性。这不是奉承你们的报纸。当然批判也应该是理性的，但现在流行的是非理性、反理性。\n\n记者：记得您说过，在不同社会阶段，需要的思想是不一样的。欧美的社会制度发展已经比较成熟，所以需要福柯这类批判思想。但在中国现在这个阶段，后现代这些东西是不是远远超前于现实了？\n\n李泽厚：这是一个复杂的问题。一个思想的作用要放到具体的社会环境里去考查。\n\n西方的资本主义发展了几百年，理性的东西相当周密。美国的法律多如牛毛，法律就是理性的具体表现。而理性，特别是工具理性，在中国是太少了。而在西方，却是工具理性太多，把人都捆起来了。所以，他们需要破坏和解构。中国恰恰相反。学者们要模仿、要接轨，把后现代硬搬过来，在基本学理上是有问题的。当然，后现代作为一种现象，为什么和如何可能产生，这倒值得研究。\n\n我想可能有这个原因：主流学者不是讲“历史的终结”嘛，历史终结，便不需要革命了，激情也没有了，过一种平平淡淡的生活。有些人感觉极不满意，有各种虚无和自我暴弃。\n\n但是，就中国社会而言，大部分人仍然没有过上好的生活，大量农民工还在为生存拼死拼活。所以，这些思想就和时代脱节了。其实，就算在资本主义国家，也有贫富悬殊问题。不然法国哪有那么大的骚乱，也是因为那些移民的第二代受到歧视吧。\n\n讲后现代的人，很大部分是学院里的教授。一些人大肆赞美非洲的原始部族。有学者说，那你干吗不把自己的孩子送到非洲去？为什么自己不去那里生活？\n\n后现代思潮实际上是在学院里，并不是发达社会的思想主流，社会的主流还是非常理性的。\n\n现在西方最时髦的就是后现代，要赶时髦，才能接轨嘛。学术和科技不一样，科技当然最时髦的就是最好的。学术却不一定。现在的理论不一定比柏拉图好到哪里去。后现代的这些代表人物反对理性、反对启蒙。但他们其实并不比康德、洛克、休谟强到哪里去。福柯、德里达这些人，我觉得比马克思差远了。\n\n记者：您仔细看过福柯、德里达吗？\n\n李泽厚：当然，只看过一些，但他们的基本思想我知道。比如福柯，我认为比较精彩的是，他说知识是与权力联系在一起的，任何一种知识都是被权力支配着。这是有道理的，甚至某些自然科学，都是被某种权力支配的。没有什么真正超脱的知识，没有与政治无关的真理。但是，马克思的思想里早就包含着这一点。其实，福柯他们受马克思的影响很深，但他们不愿意讲。海德格尔也是这样。\n\n福柯的其他主张，比如理性是监狱等等，我以为，学术价值并不高。\n\n记者：您的思想的两个基点，是不是马克思主义和儒家经典？\n\n李泽厚：一个是马克思，不是马克思主义。因为马克思也说他自己不是马克思主义者。哈哈。另一个是中国传统。我是在中国传统的基础上融化康德和马克思。我也吸收了不少后现代的思想。例如，后现代思潮反对绝对的、先验的理性，反对像康德、黑格尔那样的理性。我提出的实用理性，恰恰也是反对绝对先验的理性。我认为理性是从经验中提升出来的。这些方面便和后现代有吻合之处，或者说吸纳了他们的一些东西。又如，我反对他们的相对主义和反二分法，却又强调“度”的灵活性和不确定性，等等。\n\n记者：从计划经济到市场经济，中国的物质生活是朝向欧美那个方向。在精神文化层面上，中国是不是缺什么，怎么解决？比如中国人是不是需要宗教？\n\n李泽厚：这个问题太大了，不好谈。刘小枫说，五四时代的一个最大错误，就是没有把基督教搬进来。所以他希望基督教来救中国。但我的看法是，在基层，特别在农村和下层社会，基督教可能会有很大的传播。但要中国知识分子普遍接受基督教，是比较困难的。\n\n我也说过，在美国上课时，有个学生问我，你们中国人不信上帝，怎么还能维持那么久呢？他很惊讶。这是一个很好的问题。汉族发展到今天这么庞大的规模和人口，是一个奇迹。\n\n原因之一，我在最近的一个文章中讲，是因为中国有个“礼教”，儒家的教。它不信上帝，也不拜孔子。但是，它拜五个字：天地国亲师。我记得小时候，家里的堂屋供奉着祖宗牌位，后面的红纸上写了五个大字，天地国亲师。这就是中国的宗教，拜的就是这个东西。原来是天地君亲师，辛亥革命以后就改成天地国亲师了。国是国家，亲就是长辈和亲戚。中国的礼教，是一套行为规则，一种伦理规范，一种情感信仰。所以，我讲中国礼教的特点是宗教、伦理、政治三合一。\n\n三纲五伦，这就是中国的宗教，是和伦理、政治相结合的一个东西。但是，这个传统也丢掉了。\n\n过去的这个传统是有经济基础的，祠堂、宗祠有田，由族长来支配钱怎么用，或者办学，或者在饥荒时义赈，救济灾民。现在这些都没有了。\n\n在新的形势下，我们怎么来应对？假设我们从外面借一个宗教比如基督教或伊斯兰过来，可能性不大吧？！能否和怎样创造一种新的形式，回到中国人过去那种天地国亲师的信仰(而非政治或伦理)状态？这是中国文化要解决的大问题。\n\n到现在为止，中国还是人情味比较浓的一个社会。注重家庭生活，尊敬师长、长辈，注意各种亲属关系，和别的民族还是不同。比如打工妹赚了钱，还要寄回家，很顾家的。这在西方是不可能的。这说明什么？说明还是存在某种传统。不能说基础牢固，但场域尚在，还有可为。在这个基础上怎么发展出信仰？学者要思索，也要做一些社会调查，还要政治家的努力。这是很艰巨的事情。\n\n记者：这和您说的“西体中用”有关系吗？\n\n李泽厚：大有关系。关于西体中用，我已经写了很长的文章，不再重复。简单说两点。所谓西体就是现代化，这个现代化是从西方引进的，不是讲改革开放嘛；“体”是指社会存在。西体是指社会存在和日常生活的现代化。这才是真正的人类本体。这和我说的吃饭哲学是联系在一起的。这个“体”，不是虚无飘渺的中国精神、文化传统、精气神啊什么的。\n\n第二，我的这个西体中用是针对中体西用而言的。中体西用来自张之洞，其主要目的就是维护封建专制主义。没有中体西用，我也不会说西体中用。而中用，是西方的一套搬到中国来后的应用。中国用西方的体，会创造出新形式。所以我说转换性创造。从而，这个体也就并不完全等同于西方的那个体了。这个问题讲起来很复杂，详细的可参看我的《再说西体中用》一文。\n\n记者：上海7月份开设了首个中小学生诵经班，辅导他们学习《三字经》、《千字文》、《百家文》等儒家启蒙经典。请问您对儿童读经运动有什么看法？\n\n李泽厚：我并不反对读些经典，不然我写《论语今读》干什么。但要看你用什么思想来指导读经运动，是国粹主义、复古主义、保守主义？这些我是反对的。\n\n记者：您刚才说到中国礼教的特点，是政治、宗教、伦理三合一，这出自您对巫的理解吧？现在年轻人的思维结构，完全是西方现代科学那一套。而西方概念体系和中国传统是搭不上界的。比如哲学、宗教，中国过去都没有这些完整的概念。但您是从根子上思考，建立了一套概念体系。\n\n李泽厚：我就是从根子上找。例如，为什么中国人说天人合一？这在西方是不可能的，因为上帝和人是绝对不同质的。你只能皈依上帝，请上帝赎你的罪。你不能和上帝变成一体(除了某些异端派别)。中国的主流，儒家、道家都讲天人合一。这是哪里来的？就是我说的巫史传统。似乎别人还没这么说过。\n\n记者：周公和孔子发挥了巨大作用。\n\n李泽厚：我认为周公、孔子、秦始皇，是对中国历史影响最大，也最重要的三个人。\n\n记者：秦始皇为什么了不起呢？\n\n李泽厚：我以前没有讲过，我不是研究历史的，发言权不够。\n\n秦始皇统一中国是了不起的事情。而且，他搞了书同文等等。汉字在维持中华民族的延续、发展和统一方面起了极大的作用。我认为，汉字并不是口头语言的复写，和西方语言完全不同。但我不是语言学家，这只是我的一个看法。但我觉得这个看法很重要。\n\n汉字怎么来的？来自结绳记事。所以汉字具有神圣性、可崇拜性。我小时候，经常看到墙上贴着一张纸，上写“敬惜字纸”。一张白纸，写了字，就应该爱惜它，尊敬它。没有汉字，中国很早就分成很多个民族国家了，就和欧洲分成那么多民族一样。\n\n而且，汉字控制着语言的发展，而不是语言控制文字的发展。在西方恰恰相反，是语言控制文字的发展。要英国教授看懂11世纪的英文，那是不可能的事情。但我们可以看懂孔子、孟子的东西。文字有这么强的持续性，语言受它的控制。\n\n除了书同文，秦始皇还有汉武帝把六国开始有的郡县制给统一化、制度化了，建立了文官制度等等。这也很了不起。中国的基础都是秦汉时打下的。\n\n记者：记得您讲过，在地方和中央的关系上，您还是倾向于中央集权？\n\n李泽厚：1990年代我和很多朋友争论时说过，中央集权很重要，不能搞地方分权。中国最可怕的是内战。如果地方分权，每个地方都有个军区支持它，那湖南和广东就可以打仗了。我们这么大一个国家、统一市场，多好。欧盟就是想搞个统一市场啊。\n\n什么事都有利必有弊。中央集权当然有弊端，但比分权可能带来的四分五裂好得多。\n\n这个方面我和很多人看法不一样。有人提倡地方自治，我是不赞成的。可以搞试验，但如果发展趋向与中央对立，那就麻烦了。\n\n记者：哪些方面可以分，哪些可以统？您能不能讲得细致一点？\n\n李泽厚：我是搞哲学的，只能说个大概。经济上、政治上，哪些该分，哪些该统，那是我无法发言的。但我当年就赞成宏观调控，1990年代初吧。辛亥革命最大的问题，就是把中央集权的象征打掉了。后果一定是军阀混战。\n\n记者：您似乎对民族主义比较反感。\n\n李泽厚：民族主义，是很危险的事情。今天在世界任何地方都要反对民族主义。民族主义是最容易煽动民众感情的一种主义。如果有人鼓动，我们和日本打一仗，那一定是许多青年人争先恐后。现在之所以不能搞议会、多党制，原因之一是打民族主义大旗的政党一定优势胜出。这是非常危险的。\n\n现在学术界也有某种民族主义思想，包括我的一些学生、朋友，我是不赞成的。10年前不是有本书《中国可以说不》，我非常反感。现在也有一种情绪，认为21世纪就是中国的世纪。我也不赞成。这是一种莫名其妙的自大。不管哪个方面，科学、军事、技术、政治、文化以及经济，我们比西方都差一大截。所以我最讨厌豪言壮语。这方面我和很多人讲不来。我认为这种姿态容易误导民众。如果号召和日本或美国打仗，那一定热血沸腾，群情激奋，极不理性。\n\n记者：有很多学生游行抵制日货。这个算不算民族主义？\n\n李泽厚：我觉得，政府和学者应该注意这个问题。\n\n但我也一再说欧盟是个榜样，那么复杂的情况可以走到现在这样密切的经济联系，这才是世界真正走向大同的路径。不同文化、不同宗教、不同语言、不同传统可以联合在一起。现在不能想象法德再打仗了。也许30年后俄罗斯也会进去。为什么？因为经济的力量。\n\n对台湾也是，经济力量才能让它不和大陆分开。这就是我的马克思主义，这也是我的吃饭哲学。我说的吃饭，包括衣食住行、性健寿娱，指整个生活质量的不断上升。这个力量是最大的。\n\n人首先是一种物质性的生存动物，我不欣赏那些大讲精神至上的人。我故意用吃饭哲学这个词。有人说庸俗、粗鄙。我就是要它来刺激那些蔑视物质生活的人。你再不庸俗，也要吃饭，而且都想吃点好饭。除了印度的苦行僧。\n\n记者：能不能对自己做个评价？\n\n李泽厚：近两年已经有好几位这么问过我了。我对自己不好作评价，让时人特别是后人评价吧。我总不能像牟宗三说自己的“古今无两”吧，有人说我已在美学上远超朱光潜，哲学上远超冯友兰。我心里倾向接受，口头却连说不敢，我还没想清这到底是我的谦虚还是虚伪。我又想为什么近来老有人问这问题，我想我大概是快死了。\n\n记者：您提了一些概念，如实用理性、乐感文化、一个世界，都很独特。您的这套概念能够在中国和西方的思想之间搭一座桥，是不是可以这样理解？\n\n李泽厚：我抓了一些根本性的问题。这样才能真正走进世界，和西方沟通。从王国维到冯友兰、牟宗三，都是走向世界，我希望将来能走进世界。\n\n我这些概念，不仅中国可以用，将来西方也可以用。比如我的实用理性，当然要很长一段时间以后。对我的评价，可能要在我死后30年或50年。呵呵。\n\n记者：您在和陈明的对话《浮生论学》中几次提到，中国学术界应该重视分析哲学。我也感到，许多人用同一个词，但却是不同的含义，这样讨论问题就容易南辕北辙了。\n\n李泽厚：现在很多人不注意这个问题，经常一篇文章内自己的话有矛盾。其实一直有这个问题，当年讨论形象思维就是如此。现在的文风也不好，学后现代，搞得晦涩难懂，可以清清楚楚讲的，故意曲曲折折、模模糊糊。\n\n记者：对目前国内学术界的主力军，您有什么评价？\n\n李泽厚：在1979年的《古代思想史论》后记中，我说希望属于下一代。我希望能“为王先驱”。\n\n我希望这些年轻人能出一些非常好的作品。我当时说，红卫兵一代搞自然科学是没有希望了。但我希望在人文学界、政治方面出一些有作为的人。包括文艺界，我希望出一些大家。20多年过去了，我对此相当失望。\n\n最大问题是原创性不够，都是转述、模仿。根本性的创造太少。当然也不能胡乱创造。\n\n记者：到现在，您的著作总共印了多少册？\n\n李泽厚：我没有数。我所有书都有盗版。这些书好像还是学生买得多。因此盗版书都集中在学校区域。书有人看就好，可惜错字太多。我的书在台湾卖得也不错，例如《美的历程》，这个没想到。这大概是我的惟一安慰。\n\n记者：为什么一直有人看呢？说明一直没过时。\n\n李泽厚：不随风倒。现在讲华伦斯坦、白银经济等等，我就不信。我以为，不论做事或做学问，重要的是要有自己的判断。我一向说，判断能力比知识重要。到底哪个对，哪个错，对几分，错几分，自己要有判断。现在很多是人云亦云，赶时髦，追风。",

{"id": "1iBawiGwvgseE4V4U2ilpizEzyd6WZHO6EQcxvbe9jQ", "title": "Urban renewal analogies for web space", "body": "During the vaccination phase of the pandemic someone very close to me fell into a pit of links and mailing lists. I had understood, abstractly, that misinformation and conspiracies breed in the Venn overlap of wellness and isolation, but I hadn’t appreciated the real-life costs and anxieties that are the result. It doesn’t just stay anon.\n\nAs if we hadn’t already known, whistle-blower Frances Haugen’s patient explanations of algorithmic devilry depict a Facebook business model that puts fractions of percentage points of profit before community safety \\[1\\]. Haugen recognises the real-life consequences of misinformation, having been initially motivated to work at Facebook after her close friend was radicalised on the platform.\n\nAs much as misinformation is a problem in English speaking communities, Haugen explains, there are other more extreme concerns for human safety. Facebook subsidises the web in places where a free and open internet does not exist, and only a handful of languages have AI safety ability; programming a new language for safety and integrity does not make economic sense in societies with smaller numbers of (usually) less affluent users. The common knowledge that a lot of what’s on the web is untrue is not necessarily known in all communities. The ethnic violence in Myanmar and Ethiopia, fanned by social media groups, is just the beginning.\n\nHaugen describes how Facebook rhetoric promotes a black and white choice: *we can either have oversight or we can have privacy.* But this is a false choice. It’s not a problem of dangerous content, it’s a problem of the structures and rules / algorithms of the platform.\n\nSeemingly minor changes that Haugen claims could make a difference in limiting the spread of malicious materials (and reduce clicks / eyeballs / profit by small fractions of percentage points) include:\n\n* refining the algorithms to cap the number of invitations to a group a member can issue (embedding a **human scale**)\n* requiring links to be copied and pasted after a certain number of reshares (introducing **friction** to decisions)\n* capping the dominance of ‘extreme users’ (those who engage with the platform the most, often in anger and anxiety) in training the algorithm that influences what other users see (introducing a **mediating** factor)\n\nNotwithstanding Facebook’s recent offensive to claim the metaverse, this *is* a time for reworking the web. What began as information (Web1) and expanded into interactive content creation (Web2) is in desperate need of governance and civility. Some accountability can be achieved through code-verified decentralisation (Web3), but, even in a world where an individual’s human existence and their online actions and ownership can be proven by a 42-character Ethereum address, the public space of the web remains an under-realised and sad reflection of a community’s values.\n\n### Metaphor and analogy have value in helping the collective reworking of the web.\n\nMetaphor and analogy are methods of sense-making – ways of *framing and acting in the unknown* \\[2\\]. The practice of sense-making generates findings useful for others, outside of the case-specific or technical detail. Synthesising the explanation so that it makes sense to others has an *intersubjective* intention, that is it focuses on the capacity of people to understand each other. Sense-making is the application of discursive and relational techniques of communication; naming, distilling, abstracting and repackaging, including through stories and metaphors, continually redrafting the collective story and the ‘best available’ explanation.\n\n### Public space is a useful web analogy.\n\nEli Pariser is co-director of [New Public](https://newpublic.org/), a group with a mission to *understand what common characteristics make for “public-friendly” spaces, that valorise the collective and that are designed for the greater public good*. Much like Haugen, Pariser takes issue with the structure and governance of the web rather than the content. It’s not an information problem, it’s a problem of human relationships, trust, connection, the structures of the bonds that the information flows through. Pariser argues that the way platforms create online spaces should intentionally learn from urban spaces that are optimised for cooperation and connection. Cities are full of strangers interacting, often without danger. Pariser talks about the *civic signals* – those features that constitute the critical qualities of flourishing public spaces, and that ‘script’ human behaviours, both in real life and online \\[3\\]. Civic signals include the scale of public / online spaces, features that script behaviours and connections, the ‘soft’ architecture of programme, and governance, agency and ownership *(how and by whom are behaviours set?)*\n\n### My own job is in urban design. So here are four more urban renewal analogies through which to consider the web space:\n\n1. **Place activation \n **Curated place activation brings public life to a place in its early evolution, before a critical mass of population ‘activates’ it organically. This includes everyday and night programme, seasonal events, and temporary programme that targets specific user groups within the community. Paid ‘place managers’ have a coordinating role, but the events themselves are decided through stakeholder engagement (within the community) and through expressions of interest by external partners. To accommodate this range the structure of public spaces should be simple and flexible rather than complex. For web, this analogy illuminates the role of planned activation rather than simply letting the space fill organically, especially in the early days of a platform / group / protocol. \n \n2. **Funding**\n   In urban renewal, those who benefit from the uplift in land value contribute financially to the upgrades required to support the growing population. For example, a residential tower development will pay a fee per apartment as a contribution to funding needed community infrastructure - parks, public spaces, street upgrades. For web, this analogy questions the mechanisms for contributing to and determining infrastructure priorities as a platform grows. \n \n3. **Safety, diversity, inclusion**\n   Universal Design is the design of places and products to ensure inclusion, regardless of ability. It is distinct from accessibility because inclusion is integrated from the outset. Universal Design is the welcoming address, not the ramp added on the side. Other measures of safety and inclusion in physical public spaces are the *social field* (a scale at which people can see other people - increasing perception of safety) and *walkability* (describing - obviously - distance plus environmental comfort). For web, these features can be analogies to consider details of scale, access, user experience that support expression and connection and limit danger. \n \n4. **Long term view \n **Finally, there is the factor of time. Improving public space and safety is not wholesale reworking but long-term and incremental renewal by many hands that takes time. It’s an ongoing job, not something that can be fixed once, rebuilt, and then disregarded, it won’t ever be complete or perfect.

北京报道\n\n![经济观察报2005.12.5](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/klIE8FQUisVRzxv5AzPvT.jpg?height=4608&width=3456)\n\n李泽厚是谁？\n\n据说有一年李泽厚南下，去某大学附近的书店作客。老板在门口贴了一张不起眼的告示，引得诸多学子停步注目。他们兴高采烈，奔走相告：李泽楷要来了！\n\n一位学者在听到这个段子后感叹，“一瞬间，我感到了世事的苍凉。想当年，李泽厚是何等了得啊！八十年代的大学生、研究生，有几个不知道李泽厚的？就连他那本其实没多少人读得懂的《批判哲学的批判》，也是许多青年学子的架上之书、枕边之物。”\n\n李泽厚曾说，1990年代是“思想家淡出，学问家突显”。在新世纪已经五年的今天，大概是学人淡出、商人突显了。将李泽厚错认作李嘉诚之子、小超人李泽楷，这是时代的悲哀还是进步呢？\n\n想当年，李泽厚初出茅庐就一鸣惊人，在1956年的美学争论中，26岁的他发表《论美感、美和艺术》一文，提出美是“客观性和社会性的统一”，批评了当时鼎鼎大名的美学家朱光潜和蔡仪的观点。\n\n在此后的反右和文革中，政治的惊涛骇浪波及中国绝大部分思考着的头脑，而李泽厚却几乎没受影响。在太行山下放、在“五七干校”劳动，当有的同事忙着做家具的时候，李泽厚却用红宝书蒙着康德的著作，搞自己的哲学研究。\n\n1970年代末百废待兴，李泽厚的作品有如横空出世。从哲学、美学到思想史，他横跨多个领域。从思想到语言，都是一种崭新的面貌。\n\n《批判哲学的批判》这一纯哲学著作，当时竟然卖了3万册。而三部(古代、近代、现代)思想史论更是影响深远。李的思想洞见和文字魅力在《美的历程》一书中表现得淋漓尽致。该书1981年出版后，十年之内印了八次，成为最畅销的学术著作，甚至成为一个时代的标志，被冯友兰先生高度评价，是对中国美学、中国文学，以至于中国哲学最精练浓缩的概括。\n\n这本1979年的作品，丝毫没有革命八股的文风。即便今日看来，文字依然珠圆玉润。光是标题，便气度不凡：龙飞凤舞、青铜饕餮、魏晋风度、盛唐之音……\n\n有人宣称，以七七、七八级本科生和七八、七九级研究生为代表的一拨人是“读朦胧诗和李泽厚长大的一代”。\n\n高尔基曾这样评价叶赛宁：“与其说是一个人，倒不如说是自然界特意为了诗歌，为了表达无尽的‘田野的悲哀’、对一切生物的爱和恻隐之心而创造出来的一个器官。”《原道》主编陈明套用这个说法，认为李泽厚“也是上帝赐给中国的，进行思想的器官，为了感受时代的气息、脉搏，把它彰显放大”。\n\n李泽厚似乎总是能把握住思想文化的历史脉搏，引领学术界的目光投向一个又一个新领域。1980年代后的“美学热”、“文化热”，都与李泽厚有关。可以说，他在这十年间中国思想文化的进程中留下了自己明显的烙印。\n\n李泽厚告诉记者，他的所有书都有盗版，即便如此，著作收入也超过100万了。也许李的思想仍然有人质疑，但其在思想启蒙方面的覆盖力，恐怕不亚于正统的教科书。\n\n在1980年代，李泽厚是时髦。但世移时易，有人认为李泽厚过时了：1989年写《华夏美学》的他已是“日薄西山”。而1996年的《世纪新梦》更是“老态毕现”。\n\n李泽厚的思想究竟会在历史上占据什么位置，恐怕今人无权置喙。口无遮拦的他对记者说，“有人说我已在美学上远超朱光潜，哲学上远超冯友兰。我心里倾向接受，口头却连说不敢，我还没想清这到底是我的谦虚还是虚伪。”“对我的评价，可能要在我死后30年或50年。”\n\n李泽厚1992年1月去了美国。每年回国一次。在异国他乡教书8年，现已退休。1980年代如众星捧月般的他，1990年代给金发碧眼的年轻人讲授中国的孔子和康梁，不知是怎样的一番滋味。\n\n当学问家取代思想家，当新左派和自由主义者闹得不可开交之时，一个远离中国、远离学术圈的老人，偶尔也会超然世外地说些真话。2002年，李泽厚和陈明的对话录《浮生论学》出版，因为臧否了不少今人，惹来非议。\n\n11月的深秋，李泽厚身着睡衣，在家里接受了本报记者的专访。当他谈起世界和历史，一种孤高而强大的自信折射出背后庞大的思想支撑。当他用湘音聊起老长沙的旧时风貌，一种温暖的气氛烘托出这位老人的恬淡心境。\n\n李泽厚曾说“走自己的路”。在他看来，自己的人生际遇与反右、文革一样，都是社会大潮的起伏而已，而只有自己的思索一直闲庭信步，节奏未曾改变。正如记者几次要求，他依然穿着睡衣拍照。\n\n下面的对话，大部分都是常识。恐怕只有清醒而“不懂人情世故”的老人，才能说出这些明白而不拐弯的实话。\n\n## 访谈\n\n记者：我们的报纸提倡理性、建设性，据说您很早就有类似的提法，能不能讲一讲？\n\n李泽厚：我在1980年代有过类似说法。对五四运动，我曾评价为，理性不足，激情有余。这八个字是我曾在纪念五四运动时写的。\n\n现在有股潮流，有批人物，否定五四，觉得五四斩断了中国的文化传统。这个观点我是非常反对的。但我认为五四有很多缺点。\n\n学术界流行尼采和后现代。现在把尼采捧为学术偶像，我是不赞成的。我认为，破坏一个东西不大难，但建设一个东西却不那么容易。而人类社会是靠建设而不是靠破坏来维持其存在的。毛泽东说，先破后立，不破不立，主要是强调破的方面。实际上立比破要难得多，破了不见得立得起来。\n\n比如写学术文章，以前我说过，你指出哪个人的文章有一二三四五错误，那不太难，但你要想就这个问题提出自己的一点真正的建设性意见，就不容易。小到写文章，大到一个国家和社会的成长，建设是重要的，所以我很赞成你们报社的这个提法。\n\n一个很有名的知识分子跟我讲，知识分子的任务就是批判。似乎一考虑建设，就是想做帝王师。这个看法是不对的。这个立场在欧美可以，因为这些社会的资本主义已经很稳固了，你怎么批判也没什么关系。欧美一些知识分子做的事情就是批判，他们不管建设不建设。譬如福柯，就是反对理性，认为理性是囚笼、启蒙是错误。但是，对中国，特别是目前的中国来说，更需要理性的、建设性的东西。这一点我1999年也讲过了。\n\n20世纪70年代末80年代初，我在一篇文章中说，马克思主义不仅是批判的哲学，也应该是建设的哲学。过去一讲到马克思主义，修饰语就是批判的、革命的。但我认为，马克思主义应该也是建设性的。怎么样建设一个好的社会，精神方面、物质方面都有许多问题值得探讨研究。\n\n所以，我很赞成理性、建设性。这不是奉承你们的报纸。当然批判也应该是理性的，但现在流行的是非理性、反理性。\n\n记者：记得您说过，在不同社会阶段，需要的思想是不一样的。欧美的社会制度发展已经比较成熟，所以需要福柯这类批判思想。但在中国现在这个阶段，后现代这些东西是不是远远超前于现实了？\n\n李泽厚：这是一个复杂的问题。一个思想的作用要放到具体的社会环境里去考查。\n\n西方的资本主义发展了几百年，理性的东西相当周密。美国的法律多如牛毛，法律就是理性的具体表现。而理性，特别是工具理性，在中国是太少了。而在西方，却是工具理性太多，把人都捆起来了。所以，他们需要破坏和解构。中国恰恰相反。学者们要模仿、要接轨，把后现代硬搬过来，在基本学理上是有问题的。当然，后现代作为一种现象，为什么和如何可能产生，这倒值得研究。\n\n我想可能有这个原因：主流学者不是讲“历史的终结”嘛，历史终结，便不需要革命了，激情也没有了，过一种平平淡淡的生活。有些人感觉极不满意，有各种虚无和自我暴弃。\n\n但是，就中国社会而言，大部分人仍然没有过上好的生活，大量农民工还在为生存拼死拼活。所以，这些思想就和时代脱节了。其实，就算在资本主义国家，也有贫富悬殊问题。不然法国哪有那么大的骚乱，也是因为那些移民的第二代受到歧视吧。\n\n讲后现代的人，很大部分是学院里的教授。一些人大肆赞美非洲的原始部族。有学者说，那你干吗不把自己的孩子送到非洲去？为什么自己不去那里生活？\n\n后现代思潮实际上是在学院里，并不是发达社会的思想主流，社会的主流还是非常理性的。\n\n现在西方最时髦的就是后现代，要赶时髦，才能接轨嘛。学术和科技不一样，科技当然最时髦的就是最好的。学术却不一定。现在的理论不一定比柏拉图好到哪里去。后现代的这些代表人物反对理性、反对启蒙。但他们其实并不比康德、洛克、休谟强到哪里去。福柯、德里达这些人，我觉得比马克思差远了。\n\n记者：您仔细看过福柯、德里达吗？\n\n李泽厚：当然，只看过一些，但他们的基本思想我知道。比如福柯，我认为比较精彩的是，他说知识是与权力联系在一起的，任何一种知识都是被权力支配着。这是有道理的，甚至某些自然科学，都是被某种权力支配的。没有什么真正超脱的知识，没有与政治无关的真理。但是，马克思的思想里早就包含着这一点。其实，福柯他们受马克思的影响很深，但他们不愿意讲。海德格尔也是这样。\n\n福柯的其他主张，比如理性是监狱等等，我以为，学术价值并不高。\n\n记者：您的思想的两个基点，是不是马克思主义和儒家经典？\n\n李泽厚：一个是马克思，不是马克思主义。因为马克思也说他自己不是马克思主义者。哈哈。另一个是中国传统。我是在中国传统的基础上融化康德和马克思。我也吸收了不少后现代的思想。例如，后现代思潮反对绝对的、先验的理性，反对像康德、黑格尔那样的理性。我提出的实用理性，恰恰也是反对绝对先验的理性。我认为理性是从经验中提升出来的。这些方面便和后现代有吻合之处，或者说吸纳了他们的一些东西。又如，我反对他们的相对主义和反二分法，却又强调“度”的灵活性和不确定性，等等。\n\n记者：从计划经济到市场经济，中国的物质生活是朝向欧美那个方向。在精神文化层面上，中国是不是缺什么，怎么解决？比如中国人是不是需要宗教？\n\n李泽厚：这个问题太大了，不好谈。刘小枫说，五四时代的一个最大错误，就是没有把基督教搬进来。所以他希望基督教来救中国。但我的看法是，在基层，特别在农村和下层社会，基督教可能会有很大的传播。但要中国知识分子普遍接受基督教，是比较困难的。\n\n我也说过，在美国上课时，有个学生问我，你们中国人不信上帝，怎么还能维持那么久呢？他很惊讶。这是一个很好的问题。汉族发展到今天这么庞大的规模和人口，是一个奇迹。\n\n原因之一，我在最近的一个文章中讲，是因为中国有个“礼教”，儒家的教。它不信上帝，也不拜孔子。但是，它拜五个字：天地国亲师。我记得小时候，家里的堂屋供奉着祖宗牌位，后面的红纸上写了五个大字，天地国亲师。这就是中国的宗教，拜的就是这个东西。原来是天地君亲师，辛亥革命以后就改成天地国亲师了。国是国家，亲就是长辈和亲戚。中国的礼教，是一套行为规则，一种伦理规范，一种情感信仰。所以，我讲中国礼教的特点是宗教、伦理、政治三合一。\n\n三纲五伦，这就是中国的宗教，是和伦理、政治相结合的一个东西。但是，这个传统也丢掉了。\n\n过去的这个传统是有经济基础的，祠堂、宗祠有田，由族长来支配钱怎么用，或者办学，或者在饥荒时义赈，救济灾民。现在这些都没有了。\n\n在新的形势下，我们怎么来应对？假设我们从外面借一个宗教比如基督教或伊斯兰过来，可能性不大吧？！能否和怎样创造一种新的形式，回到中国人过去那种天地国亲师的信仰(而非政治或伦理)状态？这是中国文化要解决的大问题。\n\n到现在为止，中国还是人情味比较浓的一个社会。注重家庭生活，尊敬师长、长辈，注意各种亲属关系，和别的民族还是不同。比如打工妹赚了钱，还要寄回家，很顾家的。这在西方是不可能的。这说明什么？说明还是存在某种传统。不能说基础牢固，但场域尚在，还有可为。在这个基础上怎么发展出信仰？学者要思索，也要做一些社会调查，还要政治家的努力。这是很艰巨的事情。\n\n记者：这和您说的“西体中用”有关系吗？\n\n李泽厚：大有关系。关于西体中用，我已经写了很长的文章，不再重复。简单说两点。所谓西体就是现代化，这个现代化是从西方引进的，不是讲改革开放嘛；“体”是指社会存在。西体是指社会存在和日常生活的现代化。这才是真正的人类本体。这和我说的吃饭哲学是联系在一起的。这个“体”，不是虚无飘渺的中国精神、文化传统、精气神啊什么的。\n\n第二，我的这个西体中用是针对中体西用而言的。中体西用来自张之洞，其主要目的就是维护封建专制主义。没有中体西用，我也不会说西体中用。而中用，是西方的一套搬到中国来后的应用。中国用西方的体，会创造出新形式。所以我说转换性创造。从而，这个体也就并不完全等同于西方的那个体了。这个问题讲起来很复杂，详细的可参看我的《再说西体中用》一文。\n\n记者：上海7月份开设了首个中小学生诵经班，辅导他们学习《三字经》、《千字文》、《百家文》等儒家启蒙经典。请问您对儿童读经运动有什么看法？\n\n李泽厚：我并不反对读些经典，不然我写《论语今读》干什么。但要看你用什么思想来指导读经运动，是国粹主义、复古主义、保守主义？这些我是反对的。\n\n记者：您刚才说到中国礼教的特点，是政治、宗教、伦理三合一，这出自您对巫的理解吧？现在年轻人的思维结构，完全是西方现代科学那一套。而西方概念体系和中国传统是搭不上界的。比如哲学、宗教，中国过去都没有这些完整的概念。但您是从根子上思考，建立了一套概念体系。\n\n李泽厚：我就是从根子上找。例如，为什么中国人说天人合一？这在西方是不可能的，因为上帝和人是绝对不同质的。你只能皈依上帝，请上帝赎你的罪。你不能和上帝变成一体(除了某些异端派别)。中国的主流，儒家、道家都讲天人合一。这是哪里来的？就是我说的巫史传统。似乎别人还没这么说过。\n\n记者：周公和孔子发挥了巨大作用。\n\n李泽厚：我认为周公、孔子、秦始皇，是对中国历史影响最大，也最重要的三个人。\n\n记者：秦始皇为什么了不起呢？\n\n李泽厚：我以前没有讲过，我不是研究历史的，发言权不够。\n\n秦始皇统一中国是了不起的事情。而且，他搞了书同文等等。汉字在维持中华民族的延续、发展和统一方面起了极大的作用。我认为，汉字并不是口头语言的复写，和西方语言完全不同。但我不是语言学家，这只是我的一个看法。但我觉得这个看法很重要。\n\n汉字怎么来的？来自结绳记事。所以汉字具有神圣性、可崇拜性。我小时候，经常看到墙上贴着一张纸，上写“敬惜字纸”。一张白纸，写了字，就应该爱惜它，尊敬它。没有汉字，中国很早就分成很多个民族国家了，就和欧洲分成那么多民族一样。\n\n而且，汉字控制着语言的发展，而不是语言控制文字的发展。在西方恰恰相反，是语言控制文字的发展。要英国教授看懂11世纪的英文，那是不可能的事情。但我们可以看懂孔子、孟子的东西。文字有这么强的持续性，语言受它的控制。\n\n除了书同文，秦始皇还有汉武帝把六国开始有的郡县制给统一化、制度化了，建立了文官制度等等。这也很了不起。中国的基础都是秦汉时打下的。\n\n记者：记得您讲过，在地方和中央的关系上，您还是倾向于中央集权？\n\n李泽厚：1990年代我和很多朋友争论时说过，中央集权很重要，不能搞地方分权。中国最可怕的是内战。如果地方分权，每个地方都有个军区支持它，那湖南和广东就可以打仗了。我们这么大一个国家、统一市场，多好。欧盟就是想搞个统一市场啊。\n\n什么事都有利必有弊。中央集权当然有弊端，但比分权可能带来的四分五裂好得多。\n\n这个方面我和很多人看法不一样。有人提倡地方自治，我是不赞成的。可以搞试验，但如果发展趋向与中央对立，那就麻烦了。\n\n记者：哪些方面可以分，哪些可以统？您能不能讲得细致一点？\n\n李泽厚：我是搞哲学的，只能说个大概。经济上、政治上，哪些该分，哪些该统，那是我无法发言的。但我当年就赞成宏观调控，1990年代初吧。辛亥革命最大的问题，就是把中央集权的象征打掉了。后果一定是军阀混战。\n\n记者：您似乎对民族主义比较反感。\n\n李泽厚：民族主义，是很危险的事情。今天在世界任何地方都要反对民族主义。民族主义是最容易煽动民众感情的一种主义。如果有人鼓动，我们和日本打一仗，那一定是许多青年人争先恐后。现在之所以不能搞议会、多党制，原因之一是打民族主义大旗的政党一定优势胜出。这是非常危险的。\n\n现在学术界也有某种民族主义思想，包括我的一些学生、朋友，我是不赞成的。10年前不是有本书《中国可以说不》，我非常反感。现在也有一种情绪，认为21世纪就是中国的世纪。我也不赞成。这是一种莫名其妙的自大。不管哪个方面，科学、军事、技术、政治、文化以及经济，我们比西方都差一大截。所以我最讨厌豪言壮语。这方面我和很多人讲不来。我认为这种姿态容易误导民众。如果号召和日本或美国打仗，那一定热血沸腾，群情激奋，极不理性。\n\n记者：有很多学生游行抵制日货。这个算不算民族主义？\n\n李泽厚：我觉得，政府和学者应该注意这个问题。\n\n但我也一再说欧盟是个榜样，那么复杂的情况可以走到现在这样密切的经济联系，这才是世界真正走向大同的路径。不同文化、不同宗教、不同语言、不同传统可以联合在一起。现在不能想象法德再打仗了。也许30年后俄罗斯也会进去。为什么？因为经济的力量。\n\n对台湾也是，经济力量才能让它不和大陆分开。这就是我的马克思主义，这也是我的吃饭哲学。我说的吃饭，包括衣食住行、性健寿娱，指整个生活质量的不断上升。这个力量是最大的。\n\n人首先是一种物质性的生存动物，我不欣赏那些大讲精神至上的人。我故意用吃饭哲学这个词。有人说庸俗、粗鄙。我就是要它来刺激那些蔑视物质生活的人。你再不庸俗，也要吃饭，而且都想吃点好饭。除了印度的苦行僧。\n\n记者：能不能对自己做个评价？\n\n李泽厚：近两年已经有好几位这么问过我了。我对自己不好作评价，让时人特别是后人评价吧。我总不能像牟宗三说自己的“古今无两”吧，有人说我已在美学上远超朱光潜，哲学上远超冯友兰。我心里倾向接受，口头却连说不敢，我还没想清这到底是我的谦虚还是虚伪。我又想为什么近来老有人问这问题，我想我大概是快死了。\n\n记者：您提了一些概念，如实用理性、乐感文化、一个世界，都很独特。您的这套概念能够在中国和西方的思想之间搭一座桥，是不是可以这样理解？\n\n李泽厚：我抓了一些根本性的问题。这样才能真正走进世界，和西方沟通。从王国维到冯友兰、牟宗三，都是走向世界，我希望将来能走进世界。\n\n我这些概念，不仅中国可以用，将来西方也可以用。比如我的实用理性，当然要很长一段时间以后。对我的评价，可能要在我死后30年或50年。呵呵。\n\n记者：您在和陈明的对话《浮生论学》中几次提到，中国学术界应该重视分析哲学。我也感到，许多人用同一个词，但却是不同的含义，这样讨论问题就容易南辕北辙了。\n\n李泽厚：现在很多人不注意这个问题，经常一篇文章内自己的话有矛盾。其实一直有这个问题，当年讨论形象思维就是如此。现在的文风也不好，学后现代，搞得晦涩难懂，可以清清楚楚讲的，故意曲曲折折、模模糊糊。\n\n记者：对目前国内学术界的主力军，您有什么评价？\n\n李泽厚：在1979年的《古代思想史论》后记中，我说希望属于下一代。我希望能“为王先驱”。\n\n我希望这些年轻人能出一些非常好的作品。我当时说，红卫兵一代搞自然科学是没有希望了。但我希望在人文学界、政治方面出一些有作为的人。包括文艺界，我希望出一些大家。20多年过去了，我对此相当失望。\n\n最大问题是原创性不够，都是转述、模仿。根本性的创造太少。当然也不能胡乱创造。\n\n记者：到现在，您的著作总共印了多少册？\n\n李泽厚：我没有数。我所有书都有盗版。这些书好像还是学生买得多。因此盗版书都集中在学校区域。书有人看就好，可惜错字太多。我的书在台湾卖得也不错，例如《美的历程》，这个没想到。这大概是我的惟一安慰。\n\n记者：为什么一直有人看呢？说明一直没过时。\n\n李泽厚：不随风倒。现在讲华伦斯坦、白银经济等等，我就不信。我以为，不论做事或做学问，重要的是要有自己的判断。我一向说，判断能力比知识重要。到底哪个对，哪个错，对几分，错几分，自己要有判断。现在很多是人云亦云，赶时髦，追风。",

{"id": "BRzhN9V694JApvcYP46n1u9XvFpqsy2MqcNd3DFRbtw", "title": "Urban renewal analogies for web space", "body": "During the vaccination phase of the pandemic someone very close to me fell into a pit of links and mailing lists. I had understood, abstractly, that misinformation and conspiracies breed in the Venn overlap of wellness and isolation, but I hadn’t appreciated the real-life costs and anxieties that are the result. It doesn’t just stay anon.\n\nAs if we hadn’t already known, whistle-blower Frances Haugen’s patient explanations of algorithmic devilry depict a Facebook business model that puts fractions of percentage points of profit before community safety \\[1\\]. Haugen recognises the real-life consequences of misinformation, having been initially motivated to work at Facebook after her close friend was radicalised on the platform.\n\nAs much as misinformation is a problem in English speaking communities, Haugen explains, there are other more extreme concerns for human safety. Facebook subsidises the web in places where a free and open internet does not exist, and only a handful of languages have AI safety ability; programming a new language for safety and integrity does not make economic sense in societies with smaller numbers of (usually) less affluent users. The common knowledge that a lot of what’s on the web is untrue is not necessarily known in all communities. The ethnic violence in Myanmar and Ethiopia, fanned by social media groups, is just the beginning.\n\nHaugen describes how Facebook rhetoric promotes a black and white choice: *we can either have oversight or we can have privacy.* But this is a false choice. It’s not a problem of dangerous content, it’s a problem of the structures and rules / algorithms of the platform.\n\nSeemingly minor changes that Haugen claims could make a difference in limiting the spread of malicious materials (and reduce clicks / eyeballs / profit by small fractions of percentage points) include:\n\n* refining the algorithms to cap the number of invitations to a group a member can issue (embedding a **human scale**)\n* requiring links to be copied and pasted after a certain number of reshares (introducing **friction** to decisions)\n* capping the dominance of ‘extreme users’ (those who engage with the platform the most, often in anger and anxiety) in training the algorithm that influences what other users see (introducing a **mediating** factor)\n\nNotwithstanding Facebook’s recent offensive to claim the metaverse, this *is* a time for reworking the web. What began as information (Web1) and expanded into interactive content creation (Web2) is in desperate need of governance and civility. Some accountability can be achieved through code-verified decentralisation (Web3), but, even in a world where an individual’s human existence and their online actions and ownership can be proven by a 42-character Ethereum address, the public space of the web remains an under-realised and sad reflection of a community’s values.\n\n### Metaphor and analogy have value in helping the collective reworking of the web.\n\nMetaphor and analogy are methods of sense-making – ways of *framing and acting in the unknown* \\[2\\]. The practice of sense-making generates findings useful for others, outside of the case-specific or technical detail. Synthesising the explanation so that it makes sense to others has an *intersubjective* intention, that is it focuses on the capacity of people to understand each other. Sense-making is the application of discursive and relational techniques of communication; naming, distilling, abstracting and repackaging, including through stories and metaphors, continually redrafting the collective story and the ‘best available’ explanation.\n\n### Public space is a useful web analogy.\n\nEli Pariser is co-director of [New Public](https://newpublic.org/), a group with a mission to *understand what common characteristics make for “public-friendly” spaces, that valorise the collective and that are designed for the greater public good*. Much like Haugen, Pariser takes issue with the structure and governance of the web rather than the content. It’s not an information problem, it’s a problem of human relationships, trust, connection, the structures of the bonds that the information flows through. Pariser argues that the way platforms create online spaces should intentionally learn from urban spaces that are optimised for cooperation and connection. Cities are full of strangers interacting, often without danger. Pariser talks about the *civic signals* – those features that constitute the critical qualities of flourishing public spaces, and that ‘script’ human behaviours, both in real life and online \\[3\\]. Civic signals include the scale of public / online spaces, features that script behaviours and connections, the ‘soft’ architecture of programme, and governance, agency and ownership *(how and by whom are behaviours set?)*\n\n### My own job is in urban design. So here are four more urban renewal analogies through which to consider the web space:\n\n1. **Place activation**\n\n   Curated place activation brings public life to a place in its early evolution, before a critical mass of population ‘activates’ it organically. This includes everyday and night programme, seasonal events, and temporary programme that targets specific user groups within the community. Paid ‘place managers’ have a coordinating role, but the events themselves are decided through stakeholder engagement (within the community) and through expressions of interest by external partners. To accommodate this range the structure of public spaces should be simple and flexible rather than complex. For web, this analogy illuminates the role of planned activation rather than simply letting the space fill organically, especially in the early days of a platform / group / protocol.\n2. **Funding**\n\n   In urban renewal, those who benefit from the uplift in land value contribute financially to the upgrades required to support the growing population. For example, a residential tower development will pay a fee per apartment as a contribution to funding needed community infrastructure - parks, public spaces, street upgrades. For web, this analogy questions the mechanisms for contributing to and determining infrastructure priorities as a platform grows.\n3. **Safety, diversity, inclusion**\n\n   Universal Design is the design of places and products to ensure inclusion, regardless of ability. It is distinct from accessibility because inclusion is integrated from the outset. Universal Design is the welcoming address, not the ramp added on the side. Other measures of safety and inclusion in physical public spaces are the *social field* (a scale at which people can see other people - increasing perception of safety) and *walkability* (describing - obviously - distance plus environmental comfort). For web, these features can be analogies to consider details of scale, access, user experience that support expression and connection and limit danger.\n4. **Long term view**\n\n   Finally, there is the factor of time.

{"id": "d27sm8YACTTCw2E0puMXHMv98fUydGmlyc3UmAJHeX8", "title": "Urban renewal analogies for web space", "body": "During the vaccination phase of the pandemic someone very close to me fell into a pit of links and mailing lists. I had understood, abstractly, that misinformation and conspiracies breed in the Venn overlap of wellness and isolation, but I hadn’t appreciated the real-life costs and anxieties that are the result. It doesn’t just stay anon.\n\nAs if we hadn’t already known, whistle-blower Frances Haugen’s patient explanations of algorithmic devilry depict a Facebook business model that puts fractions of percentage points of profit before community safety \\[1\\]. Haugen recognises the real-life consequences of misinformation, having been initially motivated to work at Facebook after her close friend was radicalised on the platform.\n\nAs much as misinformation is a problem in English speaking communities, Haugen explains, there are other more extreme concerns for human safety. Facebook subsidises the web in places where a free and open internet does not exist, and only a handful of languages have AI safety ability; programming a new language for safety and integrity does not make economic sense in societies with smaller numbers of (usually) less affluent users. The common knowledge that a lot of what’s on the web is untrue is not necessarily known in all communities. The ethnic violence in Myanmar and Ethiopia, fanned by social media groups, is just the beginning.\n\nHaugen describes how Facebook rhetoric promotes a black and white choice: *we can either have oversight or we can have privacy.* But this is a false choice. It’s not a problem of dangerous content, it’s a problem of the structures and rules / algorithms of the platform.\n\nSeemingly minor changes that Haugen claims could make a difference in limiting the spread of malicious materials (and reduce clicks / eyeballs / profit by small fractions of percentage points) include:\n\n* refining the algorithms to cap the number of invitations to a group a member can issue (embedding a **human scale**)\n* requiring links to be copied and pasted after a certain number of reshares (introducing **friction** to decisions)\n* capping the dominance of ‘extreme users’ (those who engage with the platform the most, often in anger and anxiety) in training the algorithm that influences what other users see (introducing a **mediating** factor)\n\nNotwithstanding Facebook’s recent offensive to claim the metaverse, this *is* a time for reworking the web. What began as information (Web1) and expanded into interactive content creation (Web2) is in desperate need of governance and civility. Some accountability can be achieved through code-verified decentralisation (Web3), but, even in a world where an individual’s human existence and their online actions and ownership can be proven by a 42-character Ethereum address, the public space of the web remains an under-realised and sad reflection of a community’s values.\n\n### Metaphor and analogy have value in helping the collective reworking of the web.\n\nMetaphor and analogy are methods of sense-making – ways of *framing and acting in the unknown* \\[2\\]. The practice of sense-making generates findings useful for others, outside of the case-specific or technical detail. Synthesising the explanation so that it makes sense to others has an *intersubjective* intention, that is it focuses on the capacity of people to understand each other. Sense-making is the application of discursive and relational techniques of communication; naming, distilling, abstracting and repackaging, including through stories and metaphors, continually redrafting the collective story and the ‘best available’ explanation.\n\n### Public space is a useful web analogy.\n\nEli Pariser is co-director of [New Public](https://newpublic.org/), a group with a mission to *understand what common characteristics make for “public-friendly” spaces, that valorise the collective and that are designed for the greater public good*. Much like Haugen, Pariser takes issue with the structure and governance of the web rather than the content. It’s not an information problem, it’s a problem of human relationships, trust, connection, the structures of the bonds that the information flows through. Pariser argues that the way platforms create online spaces should intentionally learn from urban spaces that are optimised for cooperation and connection. Cities are full of strangers interacting, often without danger. Pariser talks about the *civic signals* – those features that constitute the critical qualities of flourishing public spaces, and that ‘script’ human behaviours, both in real life and online \\[3\\]. Civic signals include the scale of public / online spaces, features that script behaviours and connections, the ‘soft’ architecture of programme, and governance, agency and ownership *(how and by whom are behaviours set?)*\n\n### My own job is in urban design. So here are four more urban renewal analogies through which to consider the web space:\n\n1. **Place activation** \n\n   Curated place activation brings public life to a place in its early evolution, before a critical mass of population ‘activates’ it organically. This includes everyday and night programme, seasonal events, and temporary programme that targets specific user groups within the community. Paid ‘place managers’ have a coordinating role, but the events themselves are decided through stakeholder engagement (within the community) and through expressions of interest by external partners. To accommodate this range the structure of public spaces should be simple and flexible rather than complex. For web, this analogy illuminates the role of planned activation rather than simply letting the space fill organically, especially in the early days of a platform / group / protocol.\n2. **Funding**\n\n   In urban renewal, those who benefit from the uplift in land value contribute financially to the upgrades required to support the growing population. For example, a residential tower development will pay a fee per apartment as a contribution to funding needed community infrastructure - parks, public spaces, street upgrades. For web, this analogy questions the mechanisms for contributing to and determining infrastructure priorities as a platform grows.\n3. **Safety, diversity, inclusion**\n\n   Universal Design is the design of places and products to ensure inclusion, regardless of ability. It is distinct from accessibility because inclusion is integrated from the outset. Universal Design is the welcoming address, not the ramp added on the side. Other measures of safety and inclusion in physical public spaces are the *social field* (a scale at which people can see other people - increasing perception of safety) and *walkability* (describing - obviously - distance plus environmental comfort). For web, these features can be analogies to consider details of scale, access, user experience that support expression and connection and limit danger.\n4. **Long term view** \n\n   Finally, there is the factor of time. Improving public space and safety is not wholesale reworking but long-term and incremental renewal by many hands that takes time. It’s an ongoing job, not something that can be fixed once, rebuilt, and then disregarded, it won’t ever be complete or perfect. But, as Haugen says, *we shouldn’t be afraid of trying to make a problem 80% better just because we can’t make it 100% better.*\n\n\\[1\\] Frances Haugen, 2021,  <https://www.franceshaugen.com/blog/b9xlswihkike7639nn4ie23odz9eqy>\n\n\\[2\\] Deborah Ancona, 2012, Sensemaking: Framing and acting in the unknown, in *The handbook for teaching leadership: Knowing, doing, and being,* Sage\n\n\\[3\\] New Public, 2021, *Civic Signals: The qualities of flourishing digital spaces*,  <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lO4skPVekwciJGFYxxJBIBitFzzDSC0zL1-AvhgfeNs/edit#slide=id.gaae01eb308_1_81>", "timestamp": 1636005350, "digest": "PcDYvJIhXdIK_e_MMpcD0MfeRAB0ja72_c2m1VXf8CE", "contributor": "0x5a13E93873A51Fcb8C6417e8A15D8111250d3B14"}

北京报道\n\n![经济观察报2005.12.5](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/klIE8FQUisVRzxv5AzPvT.jpg?height=4608&width=3456)\n\n李泽厚是谁？\n\n据说有一年李泽厚南下，去某大学附近的书店作客。老板在门口贴了一张不起眼的告示，引得诸多学子停步注目。他们兴高采烈，奔走相告：李泽楷要来了！\n\n一位学者在听到这个段子后感叹，“一瞬间，我感到了世事的苍凉。想当年，李泽厚是何等了得啊！八十年代的大学生、研究生，有几个不知道李泽厚的？就连他那本其实没多少人读得懂的《批判哲学的批判》，也是许多青年学子的架上之书、枕边之物。”\n\n李泽厚曾说，1990年代是“思想家淡出，学问家突显”。在新世纪已经五年的今天，大概是学人淡出、商人突显了。将李泽厚错认作李嘉诚之子、小超人李泽楷，这是时代的悲哀还是进步呢？\n\n想当年，李泽厚初出茅庐就一鸣惊人，在1956年的美学争论中，26岁的他发表《论美感、美和艺术》一文，提出美是“客观性和社会性的统一”，批评了当时鼎鼎大名的美学家朱光潜和蔡仪的观点。\n\n在此后的反右和文革中，政治的惊涛骇浪波及中国绝大部分思考着的头脑，而李泽厚却几乎没受影响。在太行山下放、在“五七干校”劳动，当有的同事忙着做家具的时候，李泽厚却用红宝书蒙着康德的著作，搞自己的哲学研究。\n\n1970年代末百废待兴，李泽厚的作品有如横空出世。从哲学、美学到思想史，他横跨多个领域。从思想到语言，都是一种崭新的面貌。\n\n《批判哲学的批判》这一纯哲学著作，当时竟然卖了3万册。而三部(古代、近代、现代)思想史论更是影响深远。李的思想洞见和文字魅力在《美的历程》一书中表现得淋漓尽致。该书1981年出版后，十年之内印了八次，成为最畅销的学术著作，甚至成为一个时代的标志，被冯友兰先生高度评价，是对中国美学、中国文学，以至于中国哲学最精练浓缩的概括。\n\n这本1979年的作品，丝毫没有革命八股的文风。即便今日看来，文字依然珠圆玉润。光是标题，便气度不凡：龙飞凤舞、青铜饕餮、魏晋风度、盛唐之音……\n\n有人宣称，以七七、七八级本科生和七八、七九级研究生为代表的一拨人是“读朦胧诗和李泽厚长大的一代”。\n\n高尔基曾这样评价叶赛宁：“与其说是一个人，倒不如说是自然界特意为了诗歌，为了表达无尽的‘田野的悲哀’、对一切生物的爱和恻隐之心而创造出来的一个器官。”《原道》主编陈明套用这个说法，认为李泽厚“也是上帝赐给中国的，进行思想的器官，为了感受时代的气息、脉搏，把它彰显放大”。\n\n李泽厚似乎总是能把握住思想文化的历史脉搏，引领学术界的目光投向一个又一个新领域。1980年代后的“美学热”、“文化热”，都与李泽厚有关。可以说，他在这十年间中国思想文化的进程中留下了自己明显的烙印。\n\n李泽厚告诉记者，他的所有书都有盗版，即便如此，著作收入也超过100万了。也许李的思想仍然有人质疑，但其在思想启蒙方面的覆盖力，恐怕不亚于正统的教科书。\n\n在1980年代，李泽厚是时髦。但世移时易，有人认为李泽厚过时了：1989年写《华夏美学》的他已是“日薄西山”。而1996年的《世纪新梦》更是“老态毕现”。\n\n李泽厚的思想究竟会在历史上占据什么位置，恐怕今人无权置喙。口无遮拦的他对记者说，“有人说我已在美学上远超朱光潜，哲学上远超冯友兰。我心里倾向接受，口头却连说不敢，我还没想清这到底是我的谦虚还是虚伪。”“对我的评价，可能要在我死后30年或50年。”\n\n李泽厚1992年1月去了美国。每年回国一次。在异国他乡教书8年，现已退休。1980年代如众星捧月般的他，1990年代给金发碧眼的年轻人讲授中国的孔子和康梁，不知是怎样的一番滋味。\n\n当学问家取代思想家，当新左派和自由主义者闹得不可开交之时，一个远离中国、远离学术圈的老人，偶尔也会超然世外地说些真话。2002年，李泽厚和陈明的对话录《浮生论学》出版，因为臧否了不少今人，惹来非议。\n\n11月的深秋，李泽厚身着睡衣，在家里接受了本报记者的专访。当他谈起世界和历史，一种孤高而强大的自信折射出背后庞大的思想支撑。当他用湘音聊起老长沙的旧时风貌，一种温暖的气氛烘托出这位老人的恬淡心境。\n\n李泽厚曾说“走自己的路”。在他看来，自己的人生际遇与反右、文革一样，都是社会大潮的起伏而已，而只有自己的思索一直闲庭信步，节奏未曾改变。正如记者几次要求，他依然穿着睡衣拍照。\n\n下面的对话，大部分都是常识。恐怕只有清醒而“不懂人情世故”的老人，才能说出这些明白而不拐弯的实话。\n\n## 访谈\n\n记者：我们的报纸提倡理性、建设性，据说您很早就有类似的提法，能不能讲一讲？\n\n李泽厚：我在1980年代有过类似说法。对五四运动，我曾评价为，理性不足，激情有余。这八个字是我曾在纪念五四运动时写的。\n\n现在有股潮流，有批人物，否定五四，觉得五四斩断了中国的文化传统。这个观点我是非常反对的。但我认为五四有很多缺点。\n\n学术界流行尼采和后现代。现在把尼采捧为学术偶像，我是不赞成的。我认为，破坏一个东西不大难，但建设一个东西却不那么容易。而人类社会是靠建设而不是靠破坏来维持其存在的。毛泽东说，先破后立，不破不立，主要是强调破的方面。实际上立比破要难得多，破了不见得立得起来。\n\n比如写学术文章，以前我说过，你指出哪个人的文章有一二三四五错误，那不太难，但你要想就这个问题提出自己的一点真正的建设性意见，就不容易。小到写文章，大到一个国家和社会的成长，建设是重要的，所以我很赞成你们报社的这个提法。\n\n一个很有名的知识分子跟我讲，知识分子的任务就是批判。似乎一考虑建设，就是想做帝王师。这个看法是不对的。这个立场在欧美可以，因为这些社会的资本主义已经很稳固了，你怎么批判也没什么关系。欧美一些知识分子做的事情就是批判，他们不管建设不建设。譬如福柯，就是反对理性，认为理性是囚笼、启蒙是错误。但是，对中国，特别是目前的中国来说，更需要理性的、建设性的东西。这一点我1999年也讲过了。\n\n20世纪70年代末80年代初，我在一篇文章中说，马克思主义不仅是批判的哲学，也应该是建设的哲学。过去一讲到马克思主义，修饰语就是批判的、革命的。但我认为，马克思主义应该也是建设性的。怎么样建设一个好的社会，精神方面、物质方面都有许多问题值得探讨研究。\n\n所以，我很赞成理性、建设性。这不是奉承你们的报纸。当然批判也应该是理性的，但现在流行的是非理性、反理性。\n\n记者：记得您说过，在不同社会阶段，需要的思想是不一样的。欧美的社会制度发展已经比较成熟，所以需要福柯这类批判思想。但在中国现在这个阶段，后现代这些东西是不是远远超前于现实了？\n\n李泽厚：这是一个复杂的问题。一个思想的作用要放到具体的社会环境里去考查。\n\n西方的资本主义发展了几百年，理性的东西相当周密。美国的法律多如牛毛，法律就是理性的具体表现。而理性，特别是工具理性，在中国是太少了。而在西方，却是工具理性太多，把人都捆起来了。所以，他们需要破坏和解构。中国恰恰相反。学者们要模仿、要接轨，把后现代硬搬过来，在基本学理上是有问题的。当然，后现代作为一种现象，为什么和如何可能产生，这倒值得研究。\n\n我想可能有这个原因：主流学者不是讲“历史的终结”嘛，历史终结，便不需要革命了，激情也没有了，过一种平平淡淡的生活。有些人感觉极不满意，有各种虚无和自我暴弃。\n\n但是，就中国社会而言，大部分人仍然没有过上好的生活，大量农民工还在为生存拼死拼活。所以，这些思想就和时代脱节了。其实，就算在资本主义国家，也有贫富悬殊问题。不然法国哪有那么大的骚乱，也是因为那些移民的第二代受到歧视吧。\n\n讲后现代的人，很大部分是学院里的教授。一些人大肆赞美非洲的原始部族。有学者说，那你干吗不把自己的孩子送到非洲去？为什么自己不去那里生活？\n\n后现代思潮实际上是在学院里，并不是发达社会的思想主流，社会的主流还是非常理性的。\n\n现在西方最时髦的就是后现代，要赶时髦，才能接轨嘛。学术和科技不一样，科技当然最时髦的就是最好的。学术却不一定。现在的理论不一定比柏拉图好到哪里去。后现代的这些代表人物反对理性、反对启蒙。但他们其实并不比康德、洛克、休谟强到哪里去。福柯、德里达这些人，我觉得比马克思差远了。\n\n记者：您仔细看过福柯、德里达吗？\n\n李泽厚：当然，只看过一些，但他们的基本思想我知道。比如福柯，我认为比较精彩的是，他说知识是与权力联系在一起的，任何一种知识都是被权力支配着。这是有道理的，甚至某些自然科学，都是被某种权力支配的。没有什么真正超脱的知识，没有与政治无关的真理。但是，马克思的思想里早就包含着这一点。其实，福柯他们受马克思的影响很深，但他们不愿意讲。海德格尔也是这样。\n\n福柯的其他主张，比如理性是监狱等等，我以为，学术价值并不高。\n\n记者：您的思想的两个基点，是不是马克思主义和儒家经典？\n\n李泽厚：一个是马克思，不是马克思主义。因为马克思也说他自己不是马克思主义者。哈哈。另一个是中国传统。我是在中国传统的基础上融化康德和马克思。我也吸收了不少后现代的思想。例如，后现代思潮反对绝对的、先验的理性，反对像康德、黑格尔那样的理性。我提出的实用理性，恰恰也是反对绝对先验的理性。我认为理性是从经验中提升出来的。这些方面便和后现代有吻合之处，或者说吸纳了他们的一些东西。又如，我反对他们的相对主义和反二分法，却又强调“度”的灵活性和不确定性，等等。\n\n记者：从计划经济到市场经济，中国的物质生活是朝向欧美那个方向。在精神文化层面上，中国是不是缺什么，怎么解决？比如中国人是不是需要宗教？\n\n李泽厚：这个问题太大了，不好谈。刘小枫说，五四时代的一个最大错误，就是没有把基督教搬进来。所以他希望基督教来救中国。但我的看法是，在基层，特别在农村和下层社会，基督教可能会有很大的传播。但要中国知识分子普遍接受基督教，是比较困难的。\n\n我也说过，在美国上课时，有个学生问我，你们中国人不信上帝，怎么还能维持那么久呢？他很惊讶。这是一个很好的问题。汉族发展到今天这么庞大的规模和人口，是一个奇迹。\n\n原因之一，我在最近的一个文章中讲，是因为中国有个“礼教”，儒家的教。它不信上帝，也不拜孔子。但是，它拜五个字：天地国亲师。我记得小时候，家里的堂屋供奉着祖宗牌位，后面的红纸上写了五个大字，天地国亲师。这就是中国的宗教，拜的就是这个东西。原来是天地君亲师，辛亥革命以后就改成天地国亲师了。国是国家，亲就是长辈和亲戚。中国的礼教，是一套行为规则，一种伦理规范，一种情感信仰。所以，我讲中国礼教的特点是宗教、伦理、政治三合一。\n\n三纲五伦，这就是中国的宗教，是和伦理、政治相结合的一个东西。但是，这个传统也丢掉了。\n\n过去的这个传统是有经济基础的，祠堂、宗祠有田，由族长来支配钱怎么用，或者办学，或者在饥荒时义赈，救济灾民。现在这些都没有了。\n\n在新的形势下，我们怎么来应对？假设我们从外面借一个宗教比如基督教或伊斯兰过来，可能性不大吧？！能否和怎样创造一种新的形式，回到中国人过去那种天地国亲师的信仰(而非政治或伦理)状态？这是中国文化要解决的大问题。\n\n到现在为止，中国还是人情味比较浓的一个社会。注重家庭生活，尊敬师长、长辈，注意各种亲属关系，和别的民族还是不同。比如打工妹赚了钱，还要寄回家，很顾家的。这在西方是不可能的。这说明什么？说明还是存在某种传统。不能说基础牢固，但场域尚在，还有可为。在这个基础上怎么发展出信仰？学者要思索，也要做一些社会调查，还要政治家的努力。这是很艰巨的事情。\n\n记者：这和您说的“西体中用”有关系吗？\n\n李泽厚：大有关系。关于西体中用，我已经写了很长的文章，不再重复。简单说两点。所谓西体就是现代化，这个现代化是从西方引进的，不是讲改革开放嘛；“体”是指社会存在。西体是指社会存在和日常生活的现代化。这才是真正的人类本体。这和我说的吃饭哲学是联系在一起的。这个“体”，不是虚无飘渺的中国精神、文化传统、精气神啊什么的。\n\n第二，我的这个西体中用是针对中体西用而言的。中体西用来自张之洞，其主要目的就是维护封建专制主义。没有中体西用，我也不会说西体中用。而中用，是西方的一套搬到中国来后的应用。中国用西方的体，会创造出新形式。所以我说转换性创造。从而，这个体也就并不完全等同于西方的那个体了。这个问题讲起来很复杂，详细的可参看我的《再说西体中用》一文。\n\n记者：上海7月份开设了首个中小学生诵经班，辅导他们学习《三字经》、《千字文》、《百家文》等儒家启蒙经典。请问您对儿童读经运动有什么看法？\n\n李泽厚：我并不反对读些经典，不然我写《论语今读》干什么。但要看你用什么思想来指导读经运动，是国粹主义、复古主义、保守主义？这些我是反对的。\n\n记者：您刚才说到中国礼教的特点，是政治、宗教、伦理三合一，这出自您对巫的理解吧？现在年轻人的思维结构，完全是西方现代科学那一套。而西方概念体系和中国传统是搭不上界的。比如哲学、宗教，中国过去都没有这些完整的概念。但您是从根子上思考，建立了一套概念体系。\n\n李泽厚：我就是从根子上找。例如，为什么中国人说天人合一？这在西方是不可能的，因为上帝和人是绝对不同质的。你只能皈依上帝，请上帝赎你的罪。你不能和上帝变成一体(除了某些异端派别)。中国的主流，儒家、道家都讲天人合一。这是哪里来的？就是我说的巫史传统。似乎别人还没这么说过。\n\n记者：周公和孔子发挥了巨大作用。\n\n李泽厚：我认为周公、孔子、秦始皇，是对中国历史影响最大，也最重要的三个人。\n\n记者：秦始皇为什么了不起呢？\n\n李泽厚：我以前没有讲过，我不是研究历史的，发言权不够。\n\n秦始皇统一中国是了不起的事情。而且，他搞了书同文等等。汉字在维持中华民族的延续、发展和统一方面起了极大的作用。我认为，汉字并不是口头语言的复写，和西方语言完全不同。但我不是语言学家，这只是我的一个看法。但我觉得这个看法很重要。\n\n汉字怎么来的？来自结绳记事。所以汉字具有神圣性、可崇拜性。我小时候，经常看到墙上贴着一张纸，上写“敬惜字纸”。一张白纸，写了字，就应该爱惜它，尊敬它。没有汉字，中国很早就分成很多个民族国家了，就和欧洲分成那么多民族一样。\n\n而且，汉字控制着语言的发展，而不是语言控制文字的发展。在西方恰恰相反，是语言控制文字的发展。要英国教授看懂11世纪的英文，那是不可能的事情。但我们可以看懂孔子、孟子的东西。文字有这么强的持续性，语言受它的控制。\n\n除了书同文，秦始皇还有汉武帝把六国开始有的郡县制给统一化、制度化了，建立了文官制度等等。这也很了不起。中国的基础都是秦汉时打下的。\n\n记者：记得您讲过，在地方和中央的关系上，您还是倾向于中央集权？\n\n李泽厚：1990年代我和很多朋友争论时说过，中央集权很重要，不能搞地方分权。中国最可怕的是内战。如果地方分权，每个地方都有个军区支持它，那湖南和广东就可以打仗了。我们这么大一个国家、统一市场，多好。欧盟就是想搞个统一市场啊。\n\n什么事都有利必有弊。中央集权当然有弊端，但比分权可能带来的四分五裂好得多。\n\n这个方面我和很多人看法不一样。有人提倡地方自治，我是不赞成的。可以搞试验，但如果发展趋向与中央对立，那就麻烦了。\n\n记者：哪些方面可以分，哪些可以统？您能不能讲得细致一点？\n\n李泽厚：我是搞哲学的，只能说个大概。经济上、政治上，哪些该分，哪些该统，那是我无法发言的。但我当年就赞成宏观调控，1990年代初吧。辛亥革命最大的问题，就是把中央集权的象征打掉了。后果一定是军阀混战。\n\n记者：您似乎对民族主义比较反感。\n\n李泽厚：民族主义，是很危险的事情。今天在世界任何地方都要反对民族主义。民族主义是最容易煽动民众感情的一种主义。如果有人鼓动，我们和日本打一仗，那一定是许多青年人争先恐后。现在之所以不能搞议会、多党制，原因之一是打民族主义大旗的政党一定优势胜出。这是非常危险的。\n\n现在学术界也有某种民族主义思想，包括我的一些学生、朋友，我是不赞成的。10年前不是有本书《中国可以说不》，我非常反感。现在也有一种情绪，认为21世纪就是中国的世纪。我也不赞成。这是一种莫名其妙的自大。不管哪个方面，科学、军事、技术、政治、文化以及经济，我们比西方都差一大截。所以我最讨厌豪言壮语。这方面我和很多人讲不来。我认为这种姿态容易误导民众。如果号召和日本或美国打仗，那一定热血沸腾，群情激奋，极不理性。\n\n记者：有很多学生游行抵制日货。这个算不算民族主义？\n\n李泽厚：我觉得，政府和学者应该注意这个问题。\n\n但我也一再说欧盟是个榜样，那么复杂的情况可以走到现在这样密切的经济联系，这才是世界真正走向大同的路径。不同文化、不同宗教、不同语言、不同传统可以联合在一起。现在不能想象法德再打仗了。也许30年后俄罗斯也会进去。为什么？因为经济的力量。\n\n对台湾也是，经济力量才能让它不和大陆分开。这就是我的马克思主义，这也是我的吃饭哲学。我说的吃饭，包括衣食住行、性健寿娱，指整个生活质量的不断上升。这个力量是最大的。\n\n人首先是一种物质性的生存动物，我不欣赏那些大讲精神至上的人。我故意用吃饭哲学这个词。有人说庸俗、粗鄙。我就是要它来刺激那些蔑视物质生活的人。你再不庸俗，也要吃饭，而且都想吃点好饭。除了印度的苦行僧。\n\n记者：能不能对自己做个评价？\n\n李泽厚：近两年已经有好几位这么问过我了。我对自己不好作评价，让时人特别是后人评价吧。我总不能像牟宗三说自己的“古今无两”吧，有人说我已在美学上远超朱光潜，哲学上远超冯友兰。我心里倾向接受，口头却连说不敢，我还没想清这到底是我的谦虚还是虚伪。我又想为什么近来老有人问这问题，我想我大概是快死了。\n\n记者：您提了一些概念，如实用理性、乐感文化、一个世界，都很独特。您的这套概念能够在中国和西方的思想之间搭一座桥，是不是可以这样理解？\n\n李泽厚：我抓了一些根本性的问题。这样才能真正走进世界，和西方沟通。从王国维到冯友兰、牟宗三，都是走向世界，我希望将来能走进世界。\n\n我这些概念，不仅中国可以用，将来西方也可以用。比如我的实用理性，当然要很长一段时间以后。对我的评价，可能要在我死后30年或50年。呵呵。\n\n记者：您在和陈明的对话《浮生论学》中几次提到，中国学术界应该重视分析哲学。我也感到，许多人用同一个词，但却是不同的含义，这样讨论问题就容易南辕北辙了。\n\n李泽厚：现在很多人不注意这个问题，经常一篇文章内自己的话有矛盾。其实一直有这个问题，当年讨论形象思维就是如此。现在的文风也不好，学后现代，搞得晦涩难懂，可以清清楚楚讲的，故意曲曲折折、模模糊糊。\n\n记者：对目前国内学术界的主力军，您有什么评价？\n\n李泽厚：在1979年的《古代思想史论》后记中，我说希望属于下一代。我希望能“为王先驱”。\n\n我希望这些年轻人能出一些非常好的作品。我当时说，红卫兵一代搞自然科学是没有希望了。但我希望在人文学界、政治方面出一些有作为的人。包括文艺界，我希望出一些大家。20多年过去了，我对此相当失望。\n\n最大问题是原创性不够，都是转述、模仿。根本性的创造太少。当然也不能胡乱创造。\n\n记者：到现在，您的著作总共印了多少册？\n\n李泽厚：我没有数。我所有书都有盗版。这些书好像还是学生买得多。因此盗版书都集中在学校区域。书有人看就好，可惜错字太多。我的书在台湾卖得也不错，例如《美的历程》，这个没想到。这大概是我的惟一安慰。\n\n记者：为什么一直有人看呢？说明一直没过时。\n\n李泽厚：不随风倒。现在讲华伦斯坦、白银经济等等，我就不信。我以为，不论做事或做学问，重要的是要有自己的判断。我一向说，判断能力比知识重要。到底哪个对，哪个错，对几分，错几分，自己要有判断。现在很多是人云亦云，赶时髦，追风。",

Gox 方停止运作，用户存入的 75 万比特币和 Mt. Gox 所持的 10 万比特币，均遭骇客透过系统漏洞窃取，比特币最大的交易平台“Mt. Gox”在二月底确认遭骇，平台内的八十五万个比特币被窃，价值将近台币五亿元。总部位在日本东京的“Mt. Gox”公司向东京地方法院申请破产保护之外，执行长“卡伯列”不久之后，也公开出面道歉。\n\n2014年2月底，比特币交易网站First Meta的28岁女执行长莱德科（Autumn Radtke）日前传出在新加坡的住所死亡，外界盛传莱德科是自杀身亡。加拿大第一台比特币ATM也安放在一家咖啡厅的旁边。知名银行Flexcoin遭骇客盗领洗劫，被迫关门。Flexcoin 在 3月2日遭到攻击，攻击骇客将位于热钱包的 896 枚比特币洗劫一空，市价约达 60 万美元。不过 Flexcoin 亦指出，用户存放于离线空间“冷钱包”（cold wallet）的比特币目前并未遭受攻击尚安然无恙。韩国首台比特币ATM亮相首尔的一家咖啡厅。香港首台比特币ATM被授权给一家咖啡厅使用，位于旺角弥敦道的总统商业中心。中国大陆首台比特币ATM也将出现在上海张江高科技园区的一家名为IC咖啡的咖啡店内，而上海《第一财经日报》的记者于2014年4月14日率先体验这台比特币ATM，并且完成了这台机器在中国大陆的第一笔购买比特币的交易。台湾BitoEX币托将购买比特币导入全家便利商店共2980间。\n\n2015年5月，香港港星彭伟华成立的Mycoin比特币交易网站采用传销式买卖比特币最后周转失灵，卷款潜逃，数千人受害。前MtGox执行长马克·科尔佩勒斯被日本警方逮捕。警方指控该公司社长对系统进行非法操作，虚增虚假账户的比特币余额，以盗取比特币。\n\n2017年3月，一个比特币的价格首次超过一盎司的黄金。有消息称中国决定在叫停首次代币发售（ICO）后，限定时间内陆续关闭中国境内所有的虚拟货币交易所，比特币当日跌幅超20%。12月比特币交易价格首次突破10000美元\n\n2018年12月，比特币较历史最高点下跌80%以上\n\n2021年4月10日，比特币达到历史最高点6.48万美元\n\n![](https://pic2.zhimg.com/v2-921c6467ca805d082a732baa5e497611_b.jpg)\n\n", "timestamp": 1636012937, "digest": "X-FEE0TyQpoxxMBtqT2siYQ6e5Qq2nQZhXFUaT55Qtw", "contributor": "0x1e0012884cC3B4d6Fe361dCED4B748f53dC5c6fE"}
