I have been blogging about it since it launched in the spring of 2013, eight years ago now. I wrote [this](https://avc.com/2013/05/citibike/) at the time.\n\nSince it started getting warm in NYC about a month ago, I have been Citibiking to work, to home, to dinner, etc. And I must say that the Citibike experience in NYC has gotten a lot better in the last few years.\n\nThere are now a lot of electric bikes. I don’t use them because I prefer to get the workout, but I see a lot of people using them.\n\nThe newer bikes are really easy to ride. They keep improving the bikes and the latest lot of them are terrific.\n\nThe Citibike app has also improved. It now starts with a navigation map and you can easily see where to get your bike and where to drop it off.\n\n![](https://avc.com/content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot\\_20210420-061354-1.png)\n\nAnd finally, NYC keeps adding bike lanes and making them better. I rode all around lower manhattan yesterday and was always in a bike lane, feeling safe and that I belonged there.\n\nBiking is a great way to get around NYC and Citibike makes it so simple. Get a bike, ride somewhere, drop it off. It is one of the great things that has happened to NYC in the almost forty years we have lived here.\n", "timestamp": 1618915268, "digest": "ejuBXrucoyAju79-dWU3ES2SrWZUsbJByJM7A7zRoXQ", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}
{"id": "K7aIrGdbDyXf6sf8ceG1WJqgTU5NkMAqw09s5MwSVQQ", "title": "Come for the creator, stay for the economy", "body": "[\"Come for the tool, stay for the network\"](https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network) is a classic strategy for bootstrapping social networks. It aimed to solve a hard problem: *how do you convince people to join your social network when there's nobody else to socialize with*?\n\nOne approach is to build a single-player tool that gets people to use the product. Over time, as more people use the single-player tool, you then add social features such as likes, comments, follows, etc. to plant the seeds for a defensible network. \n\nToday, with the rise of creator-focused platforms, this mantra is evolving into: \"[come for the *creator*, stay for the network](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1195412859733168128).\" Creator-focused platforms realize that wherever the creator goes, the audience and attention follows. As a result, platforms bootstrap their network by attracting top creators.\n\nThe go-to-market strategy can generally be summarized as:\n\n1. Attract top creators with compelling features and / or a bag 💰\n2. Creators bring their audience\n3. Add features to retain the creator and their audience long-term\n\nIt's no secret that creator-focused platforms like [Instagram](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-brands-pay-instagram-reels-pay-rate-breakdown-2020-12), [TikTok](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-the-200-million-tiktok-creator-fund), [Snap](https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/spotlight-guidelines), [Spotify](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-05-19/the-joe-rogan-experience-launches-exclusive-partnership-with-spotify/), [OnlyFans](https://www.music-news.com/news/Underground/138951/OnlyFans-launches-a-new-fund-to-support-creative-industries-hit-by-the-pandemic), [Substack](https://blog.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers), and Triller ([lol](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/style/triller-app-tiktok.html)) are offering massive bags to attract top creators and their audiences.\n\nBut there's a few issues with this model:\n\n- It's hard to make a sustainable living unless you're a top creator\n- Creator payouts are determined by opaque processes\n- Content and social graphs are rarely portable across platforms\n\nIn my job at [Mirror](http://mirror.xyz/), I think a lot about how to build products that put more power back in the hands of creators and their audiences. But we aren't a \"company\", in the traditional sense. Instead, we're building a creator-focused protocol. We work with creators to understand their needs, write smart contracts, deploy them to the Ethereum network, create interfaces to access these smart contracts, and have the goal of developing a new type of network to help creators solve their problems.\n\nDecentralized protocols aren't social networks. They're *cryptoeconomic networks*.\n\nInstead of \"come for the creator, stay for the network\", I think the mantra of creator-focused protocols will be more like \"come for the creator, stay for the economy.\"\n\nHere's the difference.\n\nA social network is:\n\n- Owned by shareholders (which skews towards finance firms, executives, board directors, and early employees)\n- Governed by shareholders (in practice, governance is usually controlled by the board, CEO, and sometimes activist investors)\n- Most code is private\n- Data is secured by the company's engineering team\n- The network becomes global over time\n\nA cryptoeconomic network is:\n\n- Owned by the community\n- Governed by the community\n- Open source\n- Secured through distributed consensus, cryptography, and public / private key pairs\n- Global from day one\n\nAre cryptoeconomic networks perfect? *Hell no*.\n\nBut the point is, creator-focused protocols will be more like internet-native economies than traditional social networks. No more rigid hierarhcies, top-down product development, opaque payment schemes, taxation without representation, or walled gardens. \n\nCreator-focused protocols will have community-led decision committees, native protocol tokens for governance, value capture, and utility, decentralized grant programs, [universal creator income](https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class), an open developer ecosystem, pseudonymous collectives, degen investment clubs, protocol politicians, and more.\n\nA couple years ago this may have sounded like another one of those idealistic crypto narratives that would never *actually* work in practice. But it's already happening. Since 2018, DeFi protocols like Uniswap, Compound, and AAVE have earned billion dollar treasuries, launched protocol tokens, and started experimenting with community-led initiatives like grant programs.\n\nOver the next few years, I think creator-focused protocols will reach a similar scale.\n\nBut to get there, it usually takes an iterative approach. Similar to how social networks start off [looking like toys](https://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy) but eventually evolve into something serious, protocols also need to go through their own natural selection process.\n\nI think successful creator-focused protocols will go through three phases:\n\n- Phase 1: Creator Mode\n- Phase 2: Org. Mode\n- Phase 3: A Protocol Economy\n\nHere's a high level overview of each phase.\n\n![Three phases for creator-focused protocols](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bbc3cb0e-590f-4b6c-a6e5-22cc7d62cdfe.png?height=784&width=1666)\n\n\nWith decentralized protocols, \"come for the creator, stay for the network\" becomes \"come for the creator, stay for the economy\". Creators will have ownership stakes in the internet economies they're building. They'll be incentivized to hype up other creators. To invest in the community. To direct traffic. To provide support. Fans, curators, and community leaders will do the same. \n\nBut how do we get there?\n\nIn the rest of this post, I'll sketch out some rough thoughts on the milestones for each phase. To start, let's look at the first phase - Creator Mode.\n\n# Phase One: Creator Mode\n\nIn creator mode, the goal is to:\n\n> *\"Help creators generate on-chain revenue by selling crypto-native products.\"*\n\nHelping creators generate on-chain revenue is a good first step for a few reasons:\n\n- Convinces creators that it's worth spending more time using crypto protocols\n- Gets a creator's audience to download a wallet and on-ramp to ETH\n- Provides a foundation for future on-chain experiments\n\nIn terms of deciding what to build, I like [Li Jin's](https://twitter.com/ljin18) framework for creator lifecycles. There are four stages:\n\n1. Create something\n2. Build audience\n3. Monetize\n4. Manage and grow business\n\nToday, crypto's killer feature for creators is monetizing through NFTs. Over time, I think crypto will get better at other stages like helping creator's build their audience through token rewards and enabling new content formats. But for now, as a creator-focused protocol, your best bet is to help creators monetize (given all the interest, activity, and novel use cases around NFTs).\n\nAt Mirror, we've built tools focused on the first and third stages of the creator lifecycle: create something and monetize.\n\nOur founder / CEO, [Denis](https://twitter.com/Iiterature), realized that all creative work has a story to tell and that long form writing was one of the best ways to do so. As a result, the team has spent the past few months building a crypto-native publishing stack for creators to tell their stories. Here are a few components:\n\n- **Decentralized identity using ENS.** When you sign up for Mirror, you also register an [ENS](https://docs.ens.domains/) domain using your key. This ENS domain is basically a self-custodied Twitter username *and* Cash App handle. It's your social identity *and* economic identity. Soon, we're adding the ability to accept tips to an ENS domain and route funds to other ENS domains on Mirror.\n- **Decentralized storage using Arweave.** All posts on Mirror are signed by your key and stored as a digest on Arweave. We plan on building a tool where people can click a button to export all their posts on Mirror to easily migrate to another publishing tool if they ever choose to.\n- **Markdown editor.** Still in the early stages but the long-term vision is to have a Notion-like block based editor. You'll be able to embed crypto-native versions of crowdfunds, auctions, and global payments right in your post as easily as you can [embed an image](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1382469745178468355).\n\nAt Mirror, we also realized that creative work needs capital to sustain itself. Given that, we've also built a suite of smart contracts and a web app to help creators fund and monetize their work. A few examples include:\n\n- **Tokenized crowdfunds.** Raise ETH from anybody in the world with an Ethereum wallet. One author [recently raised $50k](https://emily.mirror.xyz/) for an upcoming novel. The crowdfund is tokenized by issuing an ERC20 token to anyone that contributes ETH to the crowdfund. The crowdfund creator can then tie revenue from NFT sales back to the crowdfund contract and token holders can redeem their tokens for a portion of the sales. This has been called a [Patronage + Ownership](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1355165547441303554) model. [Why subscribe when you can invest](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/8p0qPpLDPNkV6Bb4ObfSCdR2PKAN0Gz9tWTnGq7ikRY)? For more technical details, check [this](https://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ) out.\n- **Reserve auctions.** There are many ways to sell NFTs but reserve auctions are quickly becoming the best price discovery mechanism. Plus they're a lot of fun. As the NFT seller, you set a minimum price and the auction duration. Once the minimum bid is hit, it kicks off a clock based on the duration set by the seller. If a bid come in within the last 15 minutes, the clock is reset to 15 minutes. [Mario](https://twitter.com/mariodgabriele) from The Generalist recently teamed up with [Jack Butcher](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher) of Visualize Value to auction an NFT that [sold for ~$45k](https://generalist.mirror.xyz/ctXDylaQayrGtgFY9C1wVBZ5HnWJKGzeuWAZtZqs_io).\n- **Revenue splits.** In web2, if you reference someone in your essay by linking out to their Twitter profile or Substack, you're rewarding them with *attention*. It's then up to the other person to convert that attention into cash. But what if you could financially reward anybody in the world, *directly*? At Mirror, we recently deployed a revenue split contract that allows you to split sales with any Ethereum address. [Packy](https://twitter.com/packyM) from Not Boring [recently used](https://notboring.mirror.xyz/SPV_-bchriVn_ncDj8OgnLccSb5qAsU0sXNpg9y_UTk) this feature to split $5k in NFT sales with 16 contributors.\n\nBuilding a protocol during the Creator Mode phase is hard because you don't have much information. Also, crypto is notoriously difficult to use. Creators are used to slick onboarding flows. Not signing messages through Metamask, paying gas fees, and waiting five minutes for a transaction to be confirmed on-chain. \n\nBut we view every experiment as a chance to learn something new about the market and incorporate it back into product development. Here are a few principles we've used to guide us during this initial phase:\n\n- **Launch features with a specific use case in mind and then generalize it.** So far, our go-to-market strategy at Mirror has relied on partnering with creators on a very specific experiment they want to run. It usually starts with them asking us if doing a certain thing is possible. We go back and forth and scope out a reasonable solution that can be implemented in a couple weeks while still accomplishing their goals. We then implement the feature, reflect on learnings, and continue working with creators to iterate on the experience until we're confident to release it to all of our members. Crypto is so new that most creators aren't sure how to use it to accomplish their goals. These experiments serve as a form of documentation for creators to understand what's possible.\n- **Optimize smart contracts for security, mechanism design, composability, and gas efficiency.** As an engineer building a crypto protocol, one of the first things you'll realize is that writing smart contracts is a whole different game from any other type of programming. If you're a decent software engineer, you can learn how to write a basic smart contract pretty quickly. But it takes *years* to build secure, composable, gas-efficient smart contracts that unlock useful functionality. By far the #1 competitive advantage a protocol can have is a team of world-class smart contract engineers. I think it's really hard to build a *truly* innovative protocol without one. Although I'm nowhere near world-class myself, I've been fortunate to work with some world-class smart contract engineers at [Dharma](https://dharma.io/) and Mirror. I've noticed the four areas they're great at are: security, mechanism design, composability, and gas efficiency. Don't settle until you find a smart contract engineer that's great at these skills.\n\n![Listen to the ski instructor](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c5a9d211-e63f-450f-8ab7-e32a01b222ab.png?height=608&width=760)\n\n\n\n- **Use [guarded launches](https://medium.com/electric-capital/derisking-defi-guarded-launches-2600ce730e0a) to limit downside risk.** Our crowdfunds have a funding limit of 25 ETH (~$55k today). Although we take an extreme amount of precaution before deploying contracts to mainnet, there's always a non-zero risk of vulnerabilities. Having safeguards like funding limits ensures people don't yolo their life savings into a random crowdfund and get rekt because of a vulnerability in a contract. No bueno.\n\nOver the past few months, we've learned a lot about what creators want and how crypto can help them build stronger communities. One of the most common pieces of feedback we've received is that creators want to build sustainable recurring-revenue businesses using crypto-native tools. At the same time, they want to ensure their community has a chance to share in the upside.\n\nThis leads us to the next phase: Org. Mode.\n\n# Phase Two: Org. Mode\n\nIn org. mode, the goal is to:\n\n> *\"Help creators and communities build sustainable crypto-native businesses.\"*\n\nCreator mode is about selling crypto-native products. Org. mode is about building crypto-native communities and businesses.\n\nIt's kinda like the difference between being an independent artist vs. being signed to a record label. As an independent artist, you're responsible for production, distribution, publishing on streaming platforms, booking live concerts, selling merch, and more. Meanwhile, once you're signed to a record label, many of the implementation details are abstracted away so you can focus more time on creative work. The record label plugs you into a [system](https://jarroddicker.medium.com/the-next-media-business-talent-reputation-and-lessons-from-record-labels-e14b695c43b) that makes it easier to produce, distribute, monetize, and grow. For creator-focused protocols, I think the transition from Creator Mode to Org. Mode will look similar (minus the shitty record deals).\n\nBut what's the business model for creators? One approach is to connect value to an ERC20 token. Today, most revenue generated on creator-focused protocols goes to an EOA (e.g., an individual's wallet). It's then up to the individual to redistribute the funds themselves, if at all.\n\nHowever, Org. Mode is about building a crypto-native community with a sustainable business. We can take inspiration from DeFi protocols to understand how to design such a system.\n\nHere's the basic mechanism:\n\n- **Issue an ERC20 token**. Distribution methods could include a crowdsale, a [\"fair launch\"](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/yfi-a-tale-of-fair-launch-governance-and-value/), [airdrop](https://airdrops.io/uniswap/) to anyone that meets specified criteria, a [liquidity mining](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/liquidity-mining-a-user-centric-token-distribution-strategy-1d05c5174641) scheme for active participants, or any combination of the above.\n- **Develop on-chain revenue streams.** For DeFi protocols, this is usually a transaction fee. For creators and communities, this could include selling 1 of 1 / fractionalized / open edition NFTs,  collecting NFTs, access to a community, digital land, crowdfunds, consulting services, programmable subscriptions, etc.\n- **Funnel on-chain revenue to a treasury contract.** Sales generated by the community flow to an on-chain treasury contract. The treasury is controlled by a multi-sig wallet which submits transactions based on community governance.\n- **Redistribute funds through community governance**. If the community is optimizing for long-term growth, they may vote for a [\"buy back and build\"](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-56-buyback-and-build/8929) strategy where the treasury buys back tokens on the open market and uses them to fund community growth initiatives. Alternatively, the community could optimize for short-term liquidity by offering dividends to token holders.\n\nMost creators / communities in crypto aren't as sophisticated as DeFi protocols because the tooling doesn't exist yet. At best, they may stitch together a bunch of disparate tools. Yet, there's still a lot to desire.\n\nIn web2, there's a mature stack for building communities and businesses. Tooling for stuff like:\n\n- Financing\n- Payment processing\n- Monetization\n- Marketing automation\n- Product analytics\n\nIn web3, there's an additional set of tools that still need to be refined:\n\n- Multi-sig capabilities\n- On-chain analytics\n- Governance\n- Treasury management\n- Token rewards programs\n\nShopify makes it easy for anyone to start, manage, and scale an e-commerce store. For creator-focused protocols, Org. Mode is about making it easy for creators to start, manage, and scale a crypto-native community or business.\n\nAs a creator-focused protocol, I think it's useful to hone in on a particular use case, provide the tooling it needs to be successful, and expand from there. For Mirror, a few examples could include:\n\n- **Publication DAOs**. Most newsletter products today are optimized for single player mode. One writer. This provides benefits like autonomy and more financial upside (if you're already established). But single player mode also has downsides like a higher workload and the challenge of coming up with consistent growth strategies. A Publication DAO could share the workload, help writers gain distribution, and equitably share financial upside through transparent revenue splits. [Here's](https://air.mirror.xyz/bTAwqOAe2vG6UIq5KSPrEho_VbrfDxcswm0ZuUtPGAc) a detailed example of what a Publication DAO could look like.\n- **Investment clubs**. As we've seen with r/wallstreetbets and $DOGE, people *love* investing together. It's part [entertainment](https://helloshreyas.mirror.xyz/_lLuc5cdtUlQHQdsEh43xpnDkUPXxJ59aplYzlft88E). Part [collective action](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/opinion/what-are-nfts.html). Part fuck it I'm gonna ape. Over the past few months in crypto, investment clubs have emerged to coordinate and curate valuable NFT collections. [PleasrDAO](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/xykan-ethereum-story) is  a decentralized investment club that was formed over Twitter to purchase [an NFT](https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623) by [pplpleasr](https://twitter.com/pplpleasr1). Recently, PleasrDAO got into an epic bidding war for Edward Snowden's [first NFT](https://foundation.app/Snowden/stay-free-edward-snowden-2021-24437) and they won with a final bid of 2,224 ETH (~$4.7M today). Investment clubs have also been called [curators](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/A16NP2XXi9RdHptfdF9WHR0Xq_E1XDmUgMwPmJYOG7w) and I believe they'll be some of the most important stakeholders in the emerging crypto economy. In the past, curators like Vogue, Hypebeast, and TechCrunch decided what was cool and what wasn't. Soon, decentralized curators like PleasrDAO, [$WHALE](https://whale.me/), [SeedClub](https://seedclub.xyz/), [$FWB](https://fwb.help/), and [Flamingo DAO](https://flamingodao.xyz/) will specialize in nice verticals and invest in the highest potential creators, communities, and projects.\n- **Decentralized grant programs**. Pretty much every creator-focused platform in web2 has a creator grant program. [TikTok](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-the-200-million-tiktok-creator-fund), [Snap](https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/spotlight-guidelines), [OnlyFans](https://www.music-news.com/news/Underground/138951/OnlyFans-launches-a-new-fund-to-support-creative-industries-hit-by-the-pandemic), [Substack](https://blog.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers), etc. In web2, these programs are a clever way to acquire top creators, get their audience to join your platform, and retain them over time. But the issue is that these grant programs are opaque and cash-based with little to no equity. I think web3 grant programs will look very different. DeFi protocols like [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-grants-program-v0-1/9081), [Compound](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-grants-program/1292), and [AAVE](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-community-grants-program/3642) have started piloting their own grant programs and I'm excited to watch them evolve. For a creator-focused protocol, a grant program could work like this: creators apply for the grant on a public forum, community members contribute ETH to a pool and receive ERC20 tokens, contributors stake their ERC20s to vote on which creators should receive funding, after a certain time period the top x creators share the pool and are rewarded with protocol tokens so they have skin in the game. There's a lot that needs to be figured out here but the general idea is to make the process more transparent and to give creators more ownership over their work. These days it seems like [every](https://www.tubefilter.com/2021/04/01/tiktokers-investors-josh-richards-griffin-johnson-noah-beck-animal-capital/) [top](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/mrbeasts-management-company-night-media-has-a-new-venture-fund-thats-backed-by-creators/) [creator](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/jake-paul-looks-to-knock-out-the-venture-capital-world-with-anti-fund/) is starting their own VC fund. In web3, I could see this model evolve where top creators start grant programs and allow their community to decide how the funds should be allocated.\n\nOver the past year, creator-focused protocols have been iterating on Creator Mode. I think the next couple years are going to be about transitioning to building tools that enable Org. Mode.\n\nLooking even further ahead, what's after Org. Mode? As your protocol builds tools to help creators and communities start, manage, and scale crypto-native businesses, it becomes time to think about how to decentralize the protocol itself. This brings us to the final boss-level phase: A Protocol Economy.\n\n# Phase Three: A Protocol Economy\n\nIn the Protocol Economy phase, the goal is to:\n\n> *\"Build a community owned and operated protocol with minimal involvement from the initial development team. Ongoing development is driven by community-led committees with active participation from creators, curators, collectors, and a developer ecosystem.\"*\n\nA Protocol Economy is what separates web3 protocols from web2 companies. One of my favorite protocols to study is Yearn. [Insiders describe it](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2021/02/15/love-coordination-at-the-frontier-of-governance-how-yearn-minted-300-million) as a multicellular organism, not a corporation. There's no board of directors. No CEO. No VCs. No HR department. Instead, it started as a solo open source project and evolved into a [\"collective of contributors\"](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/how-we-think-about-yearn/7137/3).\n\nBut, does it *actually* work? Only time will tell, but so far they've coordinated to [make really difficult decisions](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-56-buyback-and-build/8929) without blowing up the community. For example, community members recently voted to increase the protocol's (previously sacred) token supply cap to fund protocol development. They've also [proposed](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/proposal-governance-2-0/10460) one of the most sophisticated decentralized governance systems in all of crypto. (I ***highly*** recommend reading [this](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2021/02/15/love-coordination-at-the-frontier-of-governance-how-yearn-minted-300-million) and [this](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-56-buyback-and-build/8929) to get a sense of their culture)***.*** Today, their protocol token $YFI has a $1.4B market cap. Not bad for what started off as a one-person open source project ten months ago.\n\nAlthough Yearn was a fully decentralized protocol from day one, there's a lot we can learn even if we take a phased approach like the one outlined so far. DeFi protocols like Uniswap and Compound took the phased approach but have began progressively decentralizing over the past few months. They've incorporated best practices from projects like Yearn and developed their own learnings while transitioning to the Protocol Economy phase.\n\nHere's a few key elements creator-focused protocols may want to consider during this phase:\n\n- **A protocol token.** Protocol tokens tend to serve two main functions: currency and [](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2019/2/19/cryptonetwork-governance-as-capital)capital. When a protocol token serves as currency, it's primarily used for consumption, has a short-term focus, high velocity, and is a medium of exchange / unit of account. When a protocol token serves as capital, it's used as a tool to govern, has a long-term focus, low velocity, and is a store of value ([source](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2019/2/19/cryptonetwork-governance-as-capital)). Sometimes, a protocol token switches from one function to another through community governance. For example, Yearn's protocol token, $YFI, was originally viewed as currency. $YFI holders received dividends and many community members were obsessed with the price action. However, some community members realized those funds may be better spent by paying core contributors to improve the protocol. As a result, the community voted to increase the token supply cap and diverted more of the treasury to core contributors instead of speculative token holders. With this change, the protocol token went from currency to capital. In a protocol economy, the token can be about more than just \"number go up\". It can be an instrument for change throughout the protocol. Currency *and* capital. For creator-focused protocols, this capital can be used to share more of the upside with creators. This could align incentives and generate more long-term growth for the protocol. You could end up seeing deals structured similar to a startup employee's compensation package. There could be token lockup periods and vesting schedules. Frankly, I think platforms *should* reward top creators the same way they reward top employees.\n- **Third party developer ecosystem**. In a Protocol Economy, the initial development team can't unilaterally change the protocol. Instead, the protocol will need to set up a ✨ thriving ✨ developer ecosystem with a suite of tools. These include: audited / well-tested smart contracts, documentation describing the entire system, subgraphs to query on-chain data, SDK's for integrating smart contracts, grant programs to fund new projects, bug bounties to improve the protocol, and clear avenues for technical support. One key difference between web2 and web3 is that on-chain data is public. As a result, you could see creator-focused protocols having tens or hundreds of different frontend clients built by third party teams. These clients would use the logic and data from the protocol's smart contracts but could also compose them with other protocol's smart contracts to create something entirely new. It's like if the content and algorithms on Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, etc. were publicly accessible. You could compose and remix functionality in crazy ways. There could be an app that's exclusively focused on helping creators finance new projects based on their on-chain revenue. Or maybe there's a marketplace to help facilitate collabs across different protocols. Lot's of crazy stuff can happen here.\n- **Community-led committees.** By committee, I don't mean those useless committees inside big companies that just meet so they can have free pizza every month. I'm talking about small, focused teams with clear KPI's, domain expertise, and skin in the game. Again, Yearn seems to be leading the way here. Over the past few months, they've noticed a few teams emerge organically. Teams for operations, development, budget control, and big brain energy, to name a few. As a result, community members [proposed](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/proposal-governance-2-0/10460) creating formal \"yTeams\". Each yTeam is empowered to make decisions regarding their domain. Whether it's how to spend the budget, defining the development roadmap, or coming up with new yield farming schemes. Who would've thought that decentralized protocols would *choose* to have so much structure? It reminds me of one of my favorite [quotes](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html) from Vitalik: \"To me, the goal of crypto was never to remove the need for all trust. Rather, the goal of crypto is to give people access to cryptographic and economic building blocks that give people more choice in *whom* to trust\". Community-led committees are chosen by their peers and are a vital force in pushing the protocol forward.\n- **Community benefit programs.** One of the most common arguments against web2 creator-focused platforms is that they take more than they give. To a certain degree, their take rates could be viewed as a form of [taxation without representation](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1374162266287968257?s=20). Of course, web2 platforms provide key services like distribution, tools for content creation, payment processing, etc. But the key question is, *are they taking more than they give*? And who should decide? In web3, the decision is in the hands of the community. In DeFi protocol economies, the most common community benefit program is a grant program. Top protocols allocate around $1M a quarter to projects they deem beneficial to the ecosystem. For creator-focused protocols, I think there's a number of creator-specific community benefit programs that could be interesting. Stuff like [universal creator income](https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class), insurance for smart contract risk, automated wealth management services, p2p zero-interest loans, etc. etc. This is the area I'm most excited to see evolve. I'm confident that communities for creator-focused protocols are going to come up with some insanely creative collective bargaining schemes to ensure they're able to not just succeed as individuals, but to succeed [as a squad](https://otherinter.net/squad-wealth/).\n\nA Protocol Economy is the boss-level phase for creator-focused protocols. But it's also the phase that's radically different from existing platforms. As creators and communities become key contributors to protocol economies, I believe crypto will go from looking like a toy to being recognized as the generation defining movement that it has the potential to be.\n\n# Closing Thoughts\n\nAlthough we walked through the three phases - Creator Mode, Org. Mode, and Protocol Economy - in a specific order, it's still important to have the end-state in mind from the earliest days of protocol development. Who you hire. Who you attract as the first customers and community members. What your website copy says. Early decisions impact your ability to move through the other phases.\n\nSo, how might \"come for the creator, stay for the economy\" end up looking in practice? \n\nIn a few years, I imagine people flocking to a creator-focused protocol because one of their favorite creators recently joined. As they build a reputation on the protocol, they may qualify to apply for a monthly stipend from the treasury to quit their job and become a full-time content creator. Or maybe they want to deposit their crypto into the community's automated wealth management system. Or maybe they raise an investment fund from the protocol treasury based on their reputation as a curator. In mature creator-focused protocols, I believe there will be emergent opportunities like these for creators, curators, community leaders, developers, protocol politicians, and passive consumers alike.\n\nThey come for the creator, but stay for the economy.\n\nAt a superficial level, they're bound by the protocol token. On a deeper level, they're bound by the desire to succeed *together*. The heart and soul of these economies isn't an invisible hand driven solely by self-interest. Nope. Instead, it's the [feathered dinosaur](https://twitter.com/tracheopteryx) that's a community leader on a mission \"to cohere & align collective intelligence\". It's the [bunny](https://twitter.com/bantg) that ships code like his life depends on it. It's the bag holders that donated 10% of their earnings back to the protocol to fund future development.\n\nIt's a new type of economy.", "timestamp": 1618930827, "digest": "1EpvJwUpx_KlRcHOKLNqADEkwHL_Z1ZYKobF2uLwgBg", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}
{"id": "-6GkmlhbmTIZJnu3ufnt7XoA2MhFF4RzsoAXcMFjQOQ", "title": "Solvency", "body": "The work of art is under constant redefinition. A powerful solvent, the NFT, has been applied to the work of art as we’ve known it so far. The reaction has begun. What form this new element will take is yet to be fully realized. One absolute remains: in time, all things dissolve.\n\nAs a digital artist this moment is liberating. A new path has opened up. NFTs offer a solution to the pitfalls of sharing work on places like Instagram, which has trapped artists inside a limbo of gamified feedback loops of likes, views, advertisements, and influence, while they struggle to convert fragmented attention into monetary value from brands, potential collaborators and employers. Now, we may have begun the shift toward a new model of the Internet, where genuine appreciation and fair compensation for digital art is possible.\n\nI've always been disappointed to see my real-time, generative work reduced to a video or still image. In its true form my work never exists in the same state twice, making the experience of viewing the work fluid and fleeting, and engaging the viewer’s attention in a way that a still image, or video cannot. So I have often felt confined by having to translate my work into a different medium than it was originally intended to be viewed.\n\nNFTs can only be viewed on the web. They are created as purely digital objects. The web itself is a rich ecosystem of technologies that can be chained together to create dynamic, interactive experiences. It makes sense that NFTs should leverage the power of the web, instead of being limited to still images or videos. The power of the blockchain has also opened up the potential for artworks to contain dynamic information about their own context, ownership, and variables from the external world.\n\nUnfortunately, the major platforms for viewing and collecting NFTs have limited capacity for displaying alternative types of work: they offer few options beyond image or video files. That limitation, along with my disappointment with the available tools, motivated me to create my own series of 1-of-1, generative, browser-based NFTs. \n\n>When you’re limited by other people’s tools, sometimes you must build your own.\n\n[Solvency #5](https://solvency.art/view/1?fullscreen=true&embed=true&display=iframe&size=large)\n\n*If viewing on Safari, enable WebGL 2 in Developer -> Experimental Features*\n\n[Solvency](https://solvency.art/) consists of four major components: the smart contract, the front-end code, the random seed, and the back-end. The smart contract determines the work’s mechanics. I collaborated with software engineer [Steve Klebanoff](https://twitter.com/steveklbnf) to produce a bespoke smart contract that handles the logic for minting each piece. \n\nEach piece in the series is simply a digital token. That is all an NFT collector ever technically owns. After a token is purchased, information from that transaction generates the work of art. Conventionally, image or video files are linked via metadata to this token within a smart contract. In theory, this metadata can contain any type of media, which means that NFTs are not limited to images and videos. **The media associated with Solvency tokens are dynamic WebGL simulations.** These simulations are feedback loops made of multiple shaders that render particles which drive the movement and form of layers of moving color and texture across the screen. The textures themselves were generated using a [GAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) trained on 35mm photographs I’ve taken over the last few years. I grouped these generated images into categories like ‘Flowers’ or ‘City.’ I also hand-selected certain combinations of values that generate particle formations within the simulation such as ‘Veins’ or ‘Smoke.’ The result is that each artwork is unique, with a wide potential for aesthetic variation, but sharing properties that produce a thematic series.\n\nIn the Solvency smart contract, a pseudo-random function generates a hash associated for each minted token, which is used to seed a deterministic random number generator. Deterministic simply means that these randomly generated values will always be the same, given the same input hash, so that the artwork will always render in the same way after it has been created. The values generated by the random number generator control the parameters of the simulation, as well as the selection of image textures that drive the color and composition of the piece. Some tokens contain combinations of textures and forms that occur less frequently than others. The piece doesn't exist until it's minted. Because of the random distribution of attributes there’s no guarantee that a certain rare attribute will exist in any of the pieces after they’ve all been minted. The smart contract points to an Arweave hash that represents a permanent copy of the front-end viewer hosted on the [Arweave blockchain](https://www.arweave.org/).\n\nIn addition to the main WebGL artwork, I opted to render each piece into video and image formats, because collectors should be able to see their artwork on the parts of the web that don’t support the real-time WebGL version, such as [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) or mobile devices. One of the challenges of Solvency was to create a backend that could automatically render artwork that had never existed before being minted. I needed to add automation to avoid manually rendering videos for all of the artworks. To do this required a significant amount of experimentation, given that the tools for rendering video on the web, especially from WebGL, are limited. Many moving parts had to be connected to create a seamless data flow between automated processes. Detailed technical discussion of the backend goes outside of the scope of this essay.\n\nThe artwork is stored on an HTTP server, and “permanently” on the Arweave blockchain. When you access the front end website at solvency.art, you're viewing a version of the work hosted on Vercel’s servers. Each piece directly links out to a streamlined version of the website, hosted on Arweave, which will render the exact same version of any Solvency piece given its token hash seed. In the case of the Arweave website, all scripts and textures are hosted on Arweave’s blockchain. If solvency.art ever went down, all pieces could still be viewed on Arweave.\n\nFor technology to improve, it must simultaneously break itself. Software becomes outmoded, deprecated, or vulnerable to security threats. Hardware becomes more performant, capable, and incompatible with older tools. It's nearly impossible to permanently archive a website (most rarely last more than 2 or 3 years) but we can try our best to conserve them for as long as possible. Digital artists will never have complete control over the software they use. Even the lowest level software depends on third parties beyond the artist’s control—packages, libraries, browsers, operating systems, compilers.\n\nBy creating an NFT built inside of a WebGL canvas, I'm making assumptions: that WebGL will continue to exist as a browser-based API, that computers will be able to run the code, and that the code is future-proof. I’m also assuming that both the Arweave and Ethereum blockchains will persist.\n\nAll works of art are built on assumptions, having to do with the potential endurance of media, e.g. canvas, paper, videotape, plastic. Artists have typically not put the concern about the longevity of materials first in their thoughts, convinced that *ars lunga, vita brevis* was sufficient reason to pitch something into the sea of time, in hopes that it would last a long time, if not ‘forever.’ It would be interesting to calculate the sheer number of works of art disappeared, deteriorated, lost to the elements, and rendered null by time—NFTs will be no exception. Art museums and collectors, armed with their expert restorers and conservators, are forever fighting against the material destinies of their collections. Often modern works, enabled by certain technological breakthroughs, become the hardest to maintain.\n\nBy fighting to preserve something, whether it be a digital file, a building, a painting, a state of being, we are fighting against the natural tendency of all organized collections of matter to move toward chaos - the tendency of entropy. Entropy is the fundamental law of the universe that measures disorder and uncertainty within any given system. Generative art and entropy run in parallel. How to create something that is at once dynamic yet never-ending, visually enticing at any given moment yet always in a state of flux, an ever-changing image, always rearranging and redrawing itself? To do so it is necessary to embrace the tendency of systems to dissolve, and move toward chaos—towards an equilibrium that can't be reversed. There is no 'undo' button in a time-based feedback loop, only the present moment and the next one. This condition of entropy is fundamental to both the tools, and the aesthetic language with which Solvency is built.\n\n*Solvency will be open to the public at 1pm EST on Thursday April 22nd.

The object is to convince a general audience that blockchain technologies like bitcoin and other “digital currencies” will have a large impact on our world.\n\nThis isn’t a popular view. Today it is difficult to even explain what bitcoin is, or how a blockchain works. Proponents too-often rely on dense technical explanations, or vague gestures towards far-future use cases. To many this sounds dodgy. If this new technology is so great, why can’t you explain it?\n\nWe’ve seen this dynamic before. Blockchain technology today is a lot like the internet in 1993 or 1994. A new technology used by a limited number of enthusiasts, associated mainly with geeks and pornographers. Explaining the internet in 1993 meant either getting into technical details like IP addresses and packets, or describing a vague future with uncertain benefits. Not a pursuit for serious people. The “web”, which would eventually fulfill most of the early advocates’ promises, barely existed.\n\nBut to understand that the internet would change the world, you didn’t have to understand the technical details or believe in a specific utopia. **Mostly, you needed one key insight: the internet radically reduced the cost of moving information.** Any process, product or business that involved moving information would be impacted by the internet. The businesses that didn’t even realize they were in the information business — “we sell CDs, not data!” — would be decimated by it. It is striking, if popularly mundane, to think about how the world has changed in 20 years:\n\n> *Before the internet, media access was tightly delineated by national borders. You could access international media if you really sought it out — when I was a kid in a small town, there were a few families on my route who received the Sunday Times — but it was expensive, and difficult to discover if you didn’t already know you wanted it.*\n\nNow, anyone anywhere (with some exceptions) has access to all media from any country in the world. They don’t receive it as a bundle of paper delivered to their doorstep, but rather through the new common medium of the web.\n\n> *Before the internet, individual people could only exchange messages or phone calls across great distances using very expensive intermediaries like phone companies.*\n\n\nNow, anyone anywhere can communicate instantly with anyone else, in any form, using a device they carry around with them in their pocket.\n\n> *Before the internet, there were very high barriers to launching new media products & companies. Distribution of physical media is very expensive, and the existing networks were largely controlled by the incumbent industries (e.g. most printing presses had, and continue to have, tight business relationships with the papers that use them). You had to be local to compete with local media.*\n\nPublishing newspapers and books is still expensive, but publishing on the internet is free and accessible to anyone. Anyone can compete with “local” media because all distribution is global distribution. This lowered the costs of entry and allowed many new companies to compete in what was previously an industry dominated by a small number of players.\n\nI believe blockchain technology is a lot like the internet in 1993. We don’t have our “web” yet, the consumer-facing leap that will open it up to a mass audience. But the underlying technology is sound, and this industry is the site of an incredible outpouring of entrepreneurial energies (and capital investment).\n\nWithin the community, it can be easy to lose sight of this big picture. There are many competing projects and [competing visions](http://www.coindesk.com/what-is-the-bitcoin-block-size-debate-and-why-does-it-matter/) for how blockchain technology should evolve. Some of these projects will succeed. Others will fail. Things will not turn out as we expect. But at this point in late 2015, it is clear that however this early industry turns out, blockchain technologies like bitcoin will have *at least* one revolutionary property: they will make it incredibly cheap to move money. To control it, to manage it, to send it.\n\nWhat might that look like?\n\n> *Before blockchain, financial access was tightly delineated by national borders. Most people only had banking relationships, if any, with the select few banks that have local branches in their hometown. You could open up accounts in foreign countries if you really sought them out — and they offered specific tax advantages or investment opportunities if you did — but it was expensive to set up, and difficult to discover if you didn’t already know you wanted it.*\n\nIn the future, anyone anywhere can access financial products and services from any company in the world. They don’t access them through traditional banks or using traditional mediums of exchange, but over a new global network of common exchange.\n\n> *Before blockchain, individual people could only exchange value over great distances by using expensive intermediaries like banks & financial services companies like Western Union.*\n\nIn the future, anyone anywhere can transfer value instantly to anyone else, using a device they carry around in their pocket.\n\n> *Before blockchain, there were very high barriers to launching new financial products & companies. Receiving, managing, and distributing large sums of money is difficult and expensive, requiring specialized expertise, a large staff, and privileged relationships with existing large financial institutions.*\n\nIn the future, receiving and distributing large sums of money or managing large numbers of transfers will be an inexpensive, automated process managed almost entirely by software. Barriers to entry for new entrants into financial services will be radically lowered, allowing many new companies to compete in what was previously a small industry dominated by large players.\n\nThe internet analogy isn’t perfect. But it’s a helpful lens. The internet transformed every industry whose business was, in some form, moving information from A to B. Blockchain, the argument goes, could have an equally transformative impact on any industry involved in moving money. If your business needs to move money around, and pays for that service, blockchain might cut your costs and expand the realm of possible business models. If your business *is* the business of moving money around, then you might want to call your CTO.\n\nMoving money from A to B is, today, quite profitable. Firms like Western Union charge an average of 8% on a transfer of $200. One of their largest markets is international remittances sent to developing nations — typically, an immigrant remitting a portion of her income back to her family. In 2015, ~$440 billion USD will be sent to developing countries this way, billions of which will go to firms like Western Union.\n\nReducing fees on remittances has been a priority for development organizations for years, for good reason. Even cutting those fees in half would add ~$17.5 billion USD to developing nations’ economies — the size of the entire UK foreign aid budget. What if we could eliminate them entirely?\n\nIn the future, the fact that there was at one point a “remittance industry” will seem as absurd as there being an “email industry” today. Moving money, like moving information, is not a service you should have to pay for. It will just be a feature of the internet. A thing you do with your phone.\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1618932658, "digest": "LFaxJZKYtgEYMM70Wt2-BWx6udWNalxWuAz5Q9Wb1fI", "contributor": "0x4aa9C5546BE68486c4eF264a230D25674a1A728e"}
{"id": "sf8UIDMuygjdmfjPamDDX_3xdDLbamj50ShMDvbFDAA", "title": "Substack vs. DAOstack", "body": "An alternative history of platforms, publishing, politics, and power.\n\n*a [Jonathan Glick](https://twitter.com/jonathanglick), [Tal Shachar](https://twitter.com/tweettal) & Jarrod Dicker joint.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/48d7ce19-4d7e-4cac-a0eb-fa1fb782fb32.png?height=746&width=486)\n\nThere’s an alternative story of Substack. Imagine the following:\n\nOnce upon a time, not so long ago, some entrepreneurs started a company that offered writers an easy way to distribute and charge for their newsletters. Their business model would be elegant-- the writer would get the software for free, and only pay a percentage of their subscription revenues (10%) to the platform if the writer decided to charge at all. \n\nMost importantly, the entrepreneurs emphasized this new platform would empower writers. It would not be a new social aggregator standing in the way between author and audience. The platform would not own the subscribers. The writer would. And she could take them with her if she decided to leave. \n\nThis offer was generally appealing. The design was good. It was easy to use. They attracted a number of writers around various topics and communities. A number of these writer’s soon attracted a decent number of loyal subscribers. But revenues remained pretty small despite momentum and the costs of development and operations were not insignificant. The platform needed capital to grow.\n\nBut here’s where the stream of time split from our reality. (Cue spooky sci-fi sound effects.) Because in *this* other dimension, the platform entrepreneurs didn’t raise venture money. Maybe this was because they couldn’t. Maybe VCs didn’t want to invest in yet another media tech play. Or maybe it was because the entrepreneurs didn’t want to. \n\nInstead, they decided to raise capital by selling crypto tokens directly to the Substack subscriber community. To make them worth buying, all subscriptions and payments were moved on-chain so that the tokens could provide their owners a number of utility benefits. First, they could be used as a way of pre-paying for newsletters in advance (support). Second, they might be associated with some profit-sharing once the platform started earning money. And lastly, the tokens would be used for governance purposes, for votes on the future strategy of the platform project itself. In essence, the platform, Substack, had become a DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization.\n\nOur other-dimension Substack team granted themselves some amount of the tokens, and perhaps under pressure, they granted some to their writers based on some formula of subscribers and/or revenues. Then, the big moment, they let Substack subscribers know they were available for purchase.  \n\nThe token sale was a success! Loyal participants, encouraged by their favorite newsletter-authors, jumped at the chance to get more deeply involved in Substack. Some of the top writers even bought more tokens themselves, using their earnings to increase their position. The price of the token quickly went up, and even people who had not yet known about the project piled in. \n\n**Substack, the Lender**\n\nAs the platform began to scale, much like in our own timeline, the project faced a big challenge. A lot of the platform’s most desirable writers, writers who could almost certainly attract a ton of paying subscribers, were currently paid employees of media companies. For them to leave those jobs and come to a platform where they were paid by subscribers meant taking a risk, and for some amount of time at least, perhaps a severe pay cut. \n\nThen, one day in the Substack discord, somebody had an idea; What if the project used the funds they just had raised to not only pay for tech and ops, but to offer some very popular writers a guarantee for the first year? It would be a bit of a gamble. These mainstream media writers’ might not be successful on the platform. But the proposal’s proponents argued that the project had no choice but to try it. The alternative would be to just wait for the slower growth of independent less well-known writers.\n\nIt was the community’s first big vote -- and it passed by a large majority. A long list of columnists and journalists had been approved for invitation to the guarantee program. To nobody’s surprise, most of these ignored or declined the offer. But some of the invited writers agreed. Still others requested a larger sum, forcing Substack to work out a kind of negotiation model where token-holders approved this new amount. Within a few months, some very big names were writing on the platform.\n\nTo the surprise of even the staunchest guarantee program advocates, the results were amazing. Many of the invited authors gained more subscribers than anticipated, easily outperforming expectations. In fact, most of the most popular writers on the platform were now guarantee recipients. \n\nThere was only one issue; as was the case in our reality, when the Substack community looked at exactly which of the guarantee writers were performing best, it turned out there was a pattern. A meaningful percentage of their top performers, whether from the left-wing or right, were those self-described as ‘anti-woke.’ As the business model is to subscribe to an individual, the relationship became less just about the content the person created and more about the position the person took. A new business of Opinions. \n\nIn retrospect, this should have been at least somewhat obvious. Who was more likely to take the leap from a ‘mainstream’ publication? Someone who was critical of what he, she, or they considered a ‘stultifying newsroom orthodoxy.’ Who might attract plenty of paying subscribers? Someone who provided news and views for the engaged audience who hated those allegedly repressive newsrooms. \n\nThe implications of this were challenging to say the least. Even though Substack did not promote their guaranteed or most popular newsletters, it seemed inevitable that these writers would come to represent the project overall. What if the association made it harder to attract readers and writers of other perspectives? What if alternative newsletter platforms seized the opportunity to steal away writers and this competition caused the token’s value began to fall? What if supporting these writers was simply wrong.\n\nSoon enough, Substack’s owner-community began raising the issue. They organized into three factions. There was the group of people who felt that the current program was working fine. They should continue to offer guarantees to well-known writers and whoever was successful. The second group argued that the guarantee program, for all of its success, had at the very least become too damaging to the brand of the project, and should be discontinued. If these ‘anti-woke’ writers continue to use the platform, fine, but any perception of editorial endorsement should be eliminated. The final group thought Substack should recognize that the biggest opportunity was to help develop writers that would reach underrepresented communities. By making a special effort to reach out to and even subsidize promising contributors before they were famous, they could expand the brand and the platform. These folks also felt that especially toxic writers should be banned from using the Substack platform.\n\nThe debate raged. There was much discordance. The project team, the readers, even those who only owned the token as an investment, all weighed in. The writers were loudest of all, rallying their followers across social media. You can probably guess which of Substack’s naturally (and professionally) argumentative pundits fell into which camp. And in some cases you’d be right. But interestingly, the debate became more complicated than that. Many of the most popular ‘anti-wokeists’ now had a lot of potential wealth tied up in Substack tokens. Some of them recognized that having the brand over-associated with one political stance, and especially with really notorious trolls, was potentially a huge drag on their value. Several of these writers came out in favor of expanding subsidies to female, POC, LGBTQ, and other underrepresented writers. Meanwhile, some of those opposed to the ‘anti-wokeists,’ despite the momentum of their position, decided to leave anyway, starting their own competitive DAO. \n\n**The Difference Between Substack and DAOstack**\n\nSo how did these two timelines differ? In many ways, they didn’t. The platform’s features were pretty much the same. The people who were popular here were popular there. The dynamic which seems to especially infect our opinion pages was just as salient in the other dimension.\n\nBut there were some subtle differences. The positions of the writers, who really are at the heart of the current debate, were not simply tweets or quotes in a Ben Smith column, not just the views of disgruntled or delighted customers. In the alternative Substack world, they were the opinions of owners seeking to influence other owners. Everyone involved recognized that the value of their tokens was directly connected to the decisions the community would make, and the high value that would result from finding a solution that would be most appealing to readers and writers.\n\nAnd in the case where the community found that solution, the DAOstack perhaps built a thriving ecosystem. As co-owners, readers actively recommended newsletters to their family and friends. The token soared in value, and the treasury became the largest single source of funding for independent journalism and opinion. Excess funds were invested in other tokens for growth and diversification, a kind of endowment. Standing committees were created to select writers who would cover underfunded subjects and communities, which introduced other possible models for book publishing and local journalism.  If a writer was not offered a grant by one of the standing committees, any token-holder or group of holders could still independently decide to provide funding. Over time, these independently originated guarantees became the majority of loans to new writers. \n\nBut what if our two timelines collided? What if, as happens from time to time in multiverses, these two dimensions became one, and Substack Inc and DAOstack both existed in the same place and time? [Alien vs. Predator?Adam Warlock vs. Magus?](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Magus_(Earth-7528)) Who would win and why?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1e2cbd81-d616-44a6-b23a-0c5e81a95236.png?height=936&width=614)\n\n**The Final Battle.**\n\nOne way to think about this is to compare how successful the two institutions would be as lenders. To oversimplify, lenders compete on three aspects: who can source the most and most promising borrowers; who can price a loan most accurately -- ie., determine how much capital and at what rate to give to ensure the most lucrative return; and who can acquire capital most inexpensively. In other words, you want to amass money at the lowest price, and give the right amount at the right price to the most people. \n\nThere’s no reason Substack Inc. couldn’t become an excellent scale lender for all sorts of paid media projects. But DAOStack might have some unique competitive advantages. \n\nFor writers and other creators, a project owned by writers and readers is a potentially appealing partner. Like Vanguard in mutual funds or non-profits who run hospitals, there’s real brand benefit that comes from being perceived as a natural ally. Maybe you’re slightly more likely to believe they are ‘on your side.’ And, socially, the fact some of your existing readers and fellow writers are likely to be DAOstack owners, makes it more likely that you’ll hear about the offer in positive terms. After all, they have a vested interest in promoting it to you.\n\nDetermining who represents a good investment and how much to stake them is a trickier, more technical capability. Presumably, over time, both Substack Inc. and DAOStack would employ algorithms that analyzed the writer’s follower base, their writing history, and the appeal of their topical focus. Maybe one would be better at this. Maybe they’d be evenly matched. In any case, it’s likely that both would continue to use human judgment, overriding the ‘computer’ when a writer felt like a good risk, or an important one, anyway. Which would be better at this? Substack Inc. would not suffer from the raucous arguments of the token-holder committees, and could perhaps allocate capital more efficiently. DAOStack’s independent token-holders and market model might be more successful in identifying smaller unexpected winners. \n\nPerhaps the DAO’s biggest advantage would be the amount of capital it could quickly accumulate.  When combined with an enthusiastic community of investors, the frictionless nature of DeFi enables capital formation at hyperspeed. It is hard to imagine that a centralized venture-backed company could match these abilities. \n\nHere in our dimension, we are in the midst of a wave of venture investing in the creator economy. Companies building new platforms for writers, artists, and other makers are closing huge rounds from A-list investors. These investments are driving much-needed product innovation. Even more importantly, they are increasingly providing the financial subsidies necessary to transition people from employment to independence. But these platforms depend on brilliant creators, and they depend on the users who are loyal to them. Without their buy-in, none of it works, at least, not for long. It’s quite possible that the decentralized ownership model enabled by DAOs and DeFi can perform as well or better as the venture one, while providing those stakeholders with a seat at the decision-making table and a piece of the pie. Why not an OnlyFans owned by the performers? Why not a Clubhouse governed by the influencers?\n\nDecentralization doesn’t eliminate the hard problems. It doesn’t wish away wars over values; hierarchies of professional vs amateur; the challenges of developing and nurturing talent. And, token-based governance isn’t necessarily going to reach the best or most ethical solutions. But the participatory purpose of a DAO makes the debates around these issues transparent. They make them a matter for the community. Instead of having ‘management’ struggle to accommodate different constituencies, the costs/benefits tradeoffs are born by the community directly and managed by the community itself. DeFi, by reducing the transaction costs and creating the infrastructure needed to operate such a system finally enables true community-run organizations.\n\nOur colliding Substacks both bring value to their communities. Both can serve as an evolution to transition into a world when you can have both financial support, creator capital, and a collective-based media platform. As we move from a purely brand-led to a talent-led media ecosystem, the venture model should evolve to encourage both the talent and its community to be owners and drivers of the experience. \n\n", "timestamp": 1618935259, "digest": "dXLsgFCPeKnOQg-81N9uaHUsvdlkAsKSGXZM5ed4UIM", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}
{"id": "7NI1OQrqVuZ1cEZoH7e4a8p4O8UcC16--mvXZH5Gmnw", "title": "Solvency", "body": "The work of art is under constant redefinition. A powerful solvent, the NFT, has been applied to the work of art as we’ve known it so far. The reaction has begun. What form this new element will take is yet to be fully realized. One absolute remains: in time, all things dissolve.\n\nAs a digital artist this moment is liberating. A new path has opened up. NFTs offer a solution to the pitfalls of sharing work on places like Instagram, which has trapped artists inside a limbo of gamified feedback loops of likes, views, advertisements, and influence, while they struggle to convert fragmented attention into monetary value from brands, potential collaborators and employers. Now, we may have begun the shift toward a new model of the Internet, where genuine appreciation and fair compensation for digital art is possible.\n\nI've always been disappointed to see my real-time, generative work reduced to a video or still image. In its true form my work never exists in the same state twice, making the experience of viewing the work fluid and fleeting, and engaging the viewer’s attention in a way that a still image, or video cannot. So I have often felt confined by having to translate my work into a different medium than it was originally intended to be viewed.\n\nNFTs can only be viewed on the web. They are created as purely digital objects. The web itself is a rich ecosystem of technologies that can be chained together to create dynamic, interactive experiences. It makes sense that NFTs should leverage the power of the web, instead of being limited to still images or videos. The power of the blockchain has also opened up the potential for artworks to contain dynamic information about their own context, ownership, and variables from the external world.\n\nUnfortunately, the major platforms for viewing and collecting NFTs have limited capacity for displaying alternative types of work: they offer few options beyond image or video files. That limitation, along with my disappointment with the available tools, motivated me to create my own series of 1-of-1, generative, browser-based NFTs. \n\n>When you’re limited by other people’s tools, sometimes you must build your own.\n\n[Solvency #5](https://solvency.art/view/5?fullscreen=true&embed=true&display=iframe&size=large)\n\n*If viewing on Safari, enable WebGL 2 in Developer -> Experimental Features*\n\n[Solvency](https://solvency.art/) consists of four major components: the smart contract, the front-end code, the random seed, and the back-end. The smart contract determines the work’s mechanics. I collaborated with software engineer [Steve Klebanoff](https://twitter.com/steveklbnf) to produce a bespoke smart contract that handles the logic for minting each piece. \n\nEach piece in the series is simply a digital token. That is all an NFT collector ever technically owns. After a token is purchased, information from that transaction generates the work of art. Conventionally, image or video files are linked via metadata to this token within a smart contract. In theory, this metadata can contain any type of media, which means that NFTs are not limited to images and videos. **The media associated with Solvency tokens are dynamic WebGL simulations.** These simulations are feedback loops made of multiple shaders that render particles which drive the movement and form of layers of moving color and texture across the screen. The textures themselves were generated using a [GAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) trained on 35mm photographs I’ve taken over the last few years. I grouped these generated images into categories like ‘Flowers’ or ‘City.’ I also hand-selected certain combinations of values that generate particle formations within the simulation such as ‘Veins’ or ‘Smoke.’ The result is that each artwork is unique, with a wide potential for aesthetic variation, but sharing properties that produce a thematic series.\n\nIn the Solvency smart contract, a pseudo-random function generates a hash associated for each minted token, which is used to seed a deterministic random number generator. Deterministic simply means that these randomly generated values will always be the same, given the same input hash, so that the artwork will always render in the same way after it has been created. The values generated by the random number generator control the parameters of the simulation, as well as the selection of image textures that drive the color and composition of the piece. Some tokens contain combinations of textures and forms that occur less frequently than others. The piece doesn't exist until it's minted. Because of the random distribution of attributes there’s no guarantee that a certain rare attribute will exist in any of the pieces after they’ve all been minted. The smart contract points to an Arweave hash that represents a permanent copy of the front-end viewer hosted on the [Arweave blockchain](https://www.arweave.org/).\n\nIn addition to the main WebGL artwork, I opted to render each piece into video and image formats, because collectors should be able to see their artwork on the parts of the web that don’t support the real-time WebGL version, such as [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) or mobile devices. One of the challenges of Solvency was to create a backend that could automatically render artwork that had never existed before being minted. I needed to add automation to avoid manually rendering videos for all of the artworks. To do this required a significant amount of experimentation, given that the tools for rendering video on the web, especially from WebGL, are limited. Many moving parts had to be connected to create a seamless data flow between automated processes. Detailed technical discussion of the backend goes outside of the scope of this essay.\n\nThe artwork is stored on an HTTP server, and “permanently” on the Arweave blockchain. When you access the front end website at solvency.art, you're viewing a version of the work hosted on Vercel’s servers. Each piece directly links out to a streamlined version of the website, hosted on Arweave, which will render the exact same version of any Solvency piece given its token hash seed. In the case of the Arweave website, all scripts and textures are hosted on Arweave’s blockchain. If solvency.art ever went down, all pieces could still be viewed on Arweave.\n\nFor technology to improve, it must simultaneously break itself. Software becomes outmoded, deprecated, or vulnerable to security threats. Hardware becomes more performant, capable, and incompatible with older tools. It's nearly impossible to permanently archive a website (most rarely last more than 2 or 3 years) but we can try our best to conserve them for as long as possible. Digital artists will never have complete control over the software they use. Even the lowest level software depends on third parties beyond the artist’s control—packages, libraries, browsers, operating systems, compilers.\n\nBy creating an NFT built inside of a WebGL canvas, I'm making assumptions: that WebGL will continue to exist as a browser-based API, that computers will be able to run the code, and that the code is future-proof. I’m also assuming that both the Arweave and Ethereum blockchains will persist.\n\nAll works of art are built on assumptions, having to do with the potential endurance of media, e.g. canvas, paper, videotape, plastic. Artists have typically not put the concern about the longevity of materials first in their thoughts, convinced that *ars lunga, vita brevis* was sufficient reason to pitch something into the sea of time, in hopes that it would last a long time, if not ‘forever.’ It would be interesting to calculate the sheer number of works of art disappeared, deteriorated, lost to the elements, and rendered null by time—NFTs will be no exception. Art museums and collectors, armed with their expert restorers and conservators, are forever fighting against the material destinies of their collections. Often modern works, enabled by certain technological breakthroughs, become the hardest to maintain.\n\nBy fighting to preserve something, whether it be a digital file, a building, a painting, a state of being, we are fighting against the natural tendency of all organized collections of matter to move toward chaos - the tendency of entropy. Entropy is the fundamental law of the universe that measures disorder and uncertainty within any given system. Generative art and entropy run in parallel. How to create something that is at once dynamic yet never-ending, visually enticing at any given moment yet always in a state of flux, an ever-changing image, always rearranging and redrawing itself? To do so it is necessary to embrace the tendency of systems to dissolve, and move toward chaos—towards an equilibrium that can't be reversed. There is no 'undo' button in a time-based feedback loop, only the present moment and the next one. This condition of entropy is fundamental to both the tools, and the aesthetic language with which Solvency is built.\n\n*Solvency will be open to the public at 1pm EST on Thursday April 22nd.

{"id": "CqZoMFq8vKMV49ZEoDPZsOF1QtBdOdtu-BgFpHdO480", "title": "Come for the creator, stay for the economy", "body": "[\"Come for the tool, stay for the network\"](https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network) is a classic strategy for bootstrapping social networks. It aimed to solve a hard problem: *how do you convince people to join your social network when there's nobody else to socialize with*?\n\nOne approach is to build a single-player tool that gets people to use the product. Over time, as more people use the single-player tool, you then add social features such as likes, comments, follows, etc. to plant the seeds for a defensible network. \n\nToday, with the rise of creator-focused platforms, this mantra is evolving into: \"[come for the *creator*, stay for the network](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1195412859733168128).\" Creator-focused platforms realize that wherever the creator goes, the audience and attention follows. As a result, platforms bootstrap their network by attracting top creators.\n\nThe go-to-market strategy can generally be summarized as:\n\n1. Attract top creators with compelling features and / or a bag 💰\n2. Creators bring their audience\n3. Add features to retain the creator and their audience long-term\n\nIt's no secret that creator-focused platforms like [Instagram](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-brands-pay-instagram-reels-pay-rate-breakdown-2020-12), [TikTok](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-the-200-million-tiktok-creator-fund), [Snap](https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/spotlight-guidelines), [Spotify](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-05-19/the-joe-rogan-experience-launches-exclusive-partnership-with-spotify/), [OnlyFans](https://www.music-news.com/news/Underground/138951/OnlyFans-launches-a-new-fund-to-support-creative-industries-hit-by-the-pandemic), [Substack](https://blog.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers), and Triller ([lol](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/style/triller-app-tiktok.html)) are offering massive bags to attract top creators and their audiences.\n\nBut there's a few issues with this model:\n\n- It's hard to make a sustainable living unless you're a top creator\n- Creator payouts are determined by opaque processes\n- Content and social graphs are rarely portable across platforms\n\nIn my job at [Mirror](http://mirror.xyz/), I think a lot about how to build products that put more power back in the hands of creators and their audiences. But we aren't a \"company\", in the traditional sense. Instead, we're building a creator-focused protocol. We work with creators to understand their needs, write smart contracts, deploy them to the Ethereum network, create interfaces to access these smart contracts, and have the goal of developing a new type of network to help creators solve their problems.\n\nDecentralized protocols aren't social networks. They're *cryptoeconomic networks*.\n\nInstead of \"come for the creator, stay for the network\", I think the mantra of creator-focused protocols will be more like \"come for the creator, stay for the economy.\"\n\nHere's the difference.\n\nA social network is:\n\n- Owned by shareholders (which skews towards finance firms, executives, board directors, and early employees)\n- Governed by shareholders (in practice, governance is usually controlled by the board, CEO, and sometimes activist investors)\n- Most code is private\n- Data is secured by the company's engineering team\n- The network becomes global over time\n\nA cryptoeconomic network is:\n\n- Owned by the community\n- Governed by the community\n- Open source\n- Secured through distributed consensus, cryptography, and public / private key pairs\n- Global from day one\n\nAre cryptoeconomic networks perfect? *Hell no*.\n\nBut the point is, creator-focused protocols will be more like internet-native economies than traditional social networks. No more rigid hierarhcies, top-down product development, opaque payment schemes, taxation without representation, or walled gardens. \n\nCreator-focused protocols will have community-led decision committees, native protocol tokens for governance, value capture, and utility, decentralized grant programs, [universal creator income](https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class), an open developer ecosystem, pseudonymous collectives, degen investment clubs, protocol politicians, and more.\n\nA couple years ago this may have sounded like another one of those idealistic crypto narratives that would never *actually* work in practice. But it's already happening. Since 2018, DeFi protocols like Uniswap, Compound, and AAVE have earned billion dollar treasuries, launched protocol tokens, and started experimenting with community-led initiatives like grant programs.\n\nOver the next few years, I think creator-focused protocols will reach a similar scale.\n\nBut to get there, it usually takes an iterative approach. Similar to how social networks start off [looking like toys](https://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy) but eventually evolve into something serious, protocols also need to go through their own natural selection process.\n\nI think successful creator-focused protocols will go through three phases:\n\n- Phase 1: Creator Mode\n- Phase 2: Org. Mode\n- Phase 3: A Protocol Economy\n\nHere's a high level overview of each phase.\n\n![Three phases for creator-focused protocols](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bbc3cb0e-590f-4b6c-a6e5-22cc7d62cdfe.png?height=784&width=1666)\n\n\nWith decentralized protocols, \"come for the creator, stay for the network\" becomes \"come for the creator, stay for the economy\". Creators will have ownership stakes in the internet economies they're building. They'll be incentivized to hype up other creators. To invest in the community. To direct traffic. To provide support. Fans, curators, and community leaders will do the same. \n\nBut how do we get there?\n\nIn the rest of this post, I'll sketch out some rough thoughts on the milestones for each phase. To start, let's look at the first phase - Creator Mode.\n\n# Phase One: Creator Mode\n\nIn creator mode, the goal is to:\n\n> *\"Help creators generate on-chain revenue by selling crypto-native products.\"*\n\nHelping creators generate on-chain revenue is a good first step for a few reasons:\n\n- Convinces creators that it's worth spending more time using crypto protocols\n- Gets a creator's audience to download a wallet and on-ramp to ETH\n- Provides a foundation for future on-chain experiments\n\nIn terms of deciding what to build, I like [Li Jin's](https://twitter.com/ljin18) framework for creator lifecycles. There are four stages:\n\n1. Create something\n2. Build audience\n3. Monetize\n4. Manage and grow business\n\nToday, crypto's killer feature for creators is monetizing through NFTs. Over time, I think crypto will get better at other stages like helping creator's build their audience through token rewards and enabling new content formats. But for now, as a creator-focused protocol, your best bet is to help creators monetize (given all the interest, activity, and novel use cases around NFTs).\n\nAt Mirror, we've built tools focused on the first and third stages of the creator lifecycle: create something and monetize.\n\nOur founder / CEO, [Denis](https://twitter.com/Iiterature), realized that all creative work has a story to tell and that long form writing was one of the best ways to do so. As a result, the team has spent the past few months building a crypto-native publishing stack for creators to tell their stories. Here are a few components:\n\n- **Decentralized identity using ENS.** When you sign up for Mirror, you also register an [ENS](https://docs.ens.domains/) domain using your key. This ENS domain is basically a self-custodied Twitter username *and* Cash App handle. It's your social identity *and* economic identity. Soon, we're adding the ability to accept tips to an ENS domain and route funds to other ENS domains on Mirror.\n- **Decentralized storage using Arweave.** All posts on Mirror are signed by your key and stored as a digest on Arweave. We plan on building a tool where people can click a button to export all their posts on Mirror to easily migrate to another publishing tool if they ever choose to.\n- **Markdown editor.** Still in the early stages but the long-term vision is to have a Notion-like block based editor. You'll be able to embed crypto-native versions of crowdfunds, auctions, and global payments right in your post as easily as you can [embed an image](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1382469745178468355).\n\nAt Mirror, we also realized that creative work needs capital to sustain itself. Given that, we've also built a suite of smart contracts and a web app to help creators fund and monetize their work. A few examples include:\n\n- **Tokenized crowdfunds.** Raise ETH from anybody in the world with an Ethereum wallet. One author [recently raised $50k](https://emily.mirror.xyz/) for an upcoming novel. The crowdfund is tokenized by issuing an ERC20 token to anyone that contributes ETH to the crowdfund. The crowdfund creator can then tie revenue from NFT sales back to the crowdfund contract and token holders can redeem their tokens for a portion of the sales. This has been called a [Patronage + Ownership](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1355165547441303554) model. [Why subscribe when you can invest](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/8p0qPpLDPNkV6Bb4ObfSCdR2PKAN0Gz9tWTnGq7ikRY)? For more technical details, check [this](https://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ) out.\n- **Reserve auctions.** There are many ways to sell NFTs but reserve auctions are quickly becoming the best price discovery mechanism. Plus they're a lot of fun. As the NFT seller, you set a minimum price and the auction duration. Once the minimum bid is hit, it kicks off a clock based on the duration set by the seller. If a bid come in within the last 15 minutes, the clock is reset to 15 minutes. [Mario](https://twitter.com/mariodgabriele) from The Generalist recently teamed up with [Jack Butcher](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher) of Visualize Value to auction an NFT that [sold for ~$45k](https://generalist.mirror.xyz/ctXDylaQayrGtgFY9C1wVBZ5HnWJKGzeuWAZtZqs_io).\n- **Revenue splits.** In web2, if you reference someone in your essay by linking out to their Twitter profile or Substack, you're rewarding them with *attention*. It's then up to the other person to convert that attention into cash. But what if you could financially reward anybody in the world, *directly*? At Mirror, we recently deployed a revenue split contract that allows you to split sales with any Ethereum address. [Packy](https://twitter.com/packyM) from Not Boring [recently used](https://notboring.mirror.xyz/SPV_-bchriVn_ncDj8OgnLccSb5qAsU0sXNpg9y_UTk) this feature to split $5k in NFT sales with 16 contributors.\n\nBuilding a protocol during the Creator Mode phase is hard because you don't have much information. Also, crypto is notoriously difficult to use. Creators are used to slick onboarding flows. Not signing messages through Metamask, paying gas fees, and waiting five minutes for a transaction to be confirmed on-chain. \n\nBut we view every experiment as a chance to learn something new about the market and incorporate it back into product development. Here are a few principles we've used to guide us during this initial phase:\n\n- **Launch features with a specific use case in mind and then generalize it.** So far, our go-to-market strategy at Mirror has relied on partnering with creators on a very specific experiment they want to run. It usually starts with them asking us if doing a certain thing is possible. We go back and forth and scope out a reasonable solution that can be implemented in a couple weeks while still accomplishing their goals. We then implement the feature, reflect on learnings, and continue working with creators to iterate on the experience until we're confident to release it to all of our members. Crypto is so new that most creators aren't sure how to use it to accomplish their goals. These experiments serve as a form of documentation for creators to understand what's possible.\n- **Optimize smart contracts for security, mechanism design, composability, and gas efficiency.** As an engineer building a crypto protocol, one of the first things you'll realize is that writing smart contracts is a whole different game from any other type of programming. If you're a decent software engineer, you can learn how to write a basic smart contract pretty quickly. But it takes *years* to build secure, composable, gas-efficient smart contracts that unlock useful functionality. By far the #1 competitive advantage a protocol can have is a team of world-class smart contract engineers. I think it's really hard to build a *truly* innovative protocol without one. Although I'm nowhere near world-class myself, I've been fortunate to work with some world-class smart contract engineers at [Dharma](https://dharma.io/) and Mirror. I've noticed the four areas they're great at are: security, mechanism design, composability, and gas efficiency. Don't settle until you find a smart contract engineer that's great at these skills.\n\n![Listen to the ski instructor](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c5a9d211-e63f-450f-8ab7-e32a01b222ab.png?height=608&width=760)\n\n\n\n- **Use [guarded launches](https://medium.com/electric-capital/derisking-defi-guarded-launches-2600ce730e0a) to limit downside risk.** Our crowdfunds have a funding limit of 25 ETH (~$55k today). Although we take an extreme amount of precaution before deploying contracts to mainnet, there's always a non-zero risk of vulnerabilities. Having safeguards like funding limits ensures people don't yolo their life savings into a random crowdfund and get rekt because of a vulnerability in a contract. No bueno.\n\nOver the past few months, we've learned a lot about what creators want and how crypto can help them build stronger communities. One of the most common pieces of feedback we've received is that creators want to build sustainable recurring-revenue businesses using crypto-native tools. At the same time, they want to ensure their community has a chance to share in the upside.\n\nThis leads us to the next phase: Org. Mode.\n\n# Phase Two: Org. Mode\n\nIn org. mode, the goal is to:\n\n> *\"Help creators and communities build sustainable crypto-native businesses.\"*\n\nCreator mode is about selling crypto-native products. Org. mode is about building crypto-native communities and businesses.\n\nIt's kinda like the difference between being an independent artist vs. being signed to a record label. As an independent artist, you're responsible for production, distribution, publishing on streaming platforms, booking live concerts, selling merch, and more. Meanwhile, once you're signed to a record label, many of the implementation details are abstracted away so you can focus more time on creative work. The record label plugs you into a [system](https://jarroddicker.medium.com/the-next-media-business-talent-reputation-and-lessons-from-record-labels-e14b695c43b) that makes it easier to produce, distribute, monetize, and grow. For creator-focused protocols, I think the transition from Creator Mode to Org. Mode will look similar (minus the shitty record deals).\n\nBut what's the business model for creators? One approach is to connect value to an ERC20 token. Today, most revenue generated on creator-focused protocols goes to an EOA (e.g., an individual's wallet). It's then up to the individual to redistribute the funds themselves, if at all.\n\nHowever, Org. Mode is about building a crypto-native community with a sustainable business. We can take inspiration from DeFi protocols to understand how to design such a system.\n\nHere's the basic mechanism:\n\n- **Issue an ERC20 token**. Distribution methods could include a crowdsale, a [\"fair launch\"](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/yfi-a-tale-of-fair-launch-governance-and-value/), [airdrop](https://airdrops.io/uniswap/) to anyone that meets specified criteria, a [liquidity mining](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/liquidity-mining-a-user-centric-token-distribution-strategy-1d05c5174641) scheme for active participants, or any combination of the above.\n- **Develop on-chain revenue streams.** For DeFi protocols, this is usually a transaction fee. For creators and communities, this could include selling 1 of 1 / fractionalized / open edition NFTs,  collecting NFTs, access to a community, digital land, crowdfunds, consulting services, programmable subscriptions, etc.\n- **Funnel on-chain revenue to a treasury contract.** Sales generated by the community flow to an on-chain treasury contract. The treasury is controlled by a multi-sig wallet which submits transactions based on community governance.\n- **Redistribute funds through community governance**. If the community is optimizing for long-term growth, they may vote for a [\"buy back and build\"](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-56-buyback-and-build/8929) strategy where the treasury buys back tokens on the open market and uses them to fund community growth initiatives. Alternatively, the community could optimize for short-term liquidity by offering dividends to token holders.\n\nMost creators / communities in crypto aren't as sophisticated as DeFi protocols because the tooling doesn't exist yet. At best, they may stitch together a bunch of disparate tools. Yet, there's still a lot to desire.\n\nIn web2, there's a mature stack for building communities and businesses. Tooling for stuff like:\n\n- Financing\n- Payment processing\n- Monetization\n- Marketing automation\n- Product analytics\n\nIn web3, there's an additional set of tools that still need to be refined:\n\n- Multi-sig capabilities\n- On-chain analytics\n- Governance\n- Treasury management\n- Token rewards programs\n\nShopify makes it easy for anyone to start, manage, and scale an e-commerce store. For creator-focused protocols, Org. Mode is about making it easy for creators to start, manage, and scale a crypto-native community or business.\n\nAs a creator-focused protocol, I think it's useful to hone in on a particular use case, provide the tooling it needs to be successful, and expand from there. For Mirror, a few examples could include:\n\n- **Publication DAOs**. Most newsletter products today are optimized for single player mode. One writer. This provides benefits like autonomy and more financial upside (if you're already established). But single player mode also has downsides like a higher workload and the challenge of coming up with consistent growth strategies. A Publication DAO could share the workload, help writers gain distribution, and equitably share financial upside through transparent revenue splits. [Here's](https://air.mirror.xyz/bTAwqOAe2vG6UIq5KSPrEho_VbrfDxcswm0ZuUtPGAc) a detailed example of what a Publication DAO could look like.\n- **Investment clubs**. As we've seen with r/wallstreetbets and $DOGE, people *love* investing together. It's part [entertainment](https://helloshreyas.mirror.xyz/_lLuc5cdtUlQHQdsEh43xpnDkUPXxJ59aplYzlft88E). Part [collective action](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/opinion/what-are-nfts.html). Part fuck it I'm gonna ape. Over the past few months in crypto, investment clubs have emerged to coordinate and curate valuable NFT collections. [PleasrDAO](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/xykan-ethereum-story) is  a decentralized investment club that was formed over Twitter to purchase [an NFT](https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623) by [pplpleasr](https://twitter.com/pplpleasr1). Recently, PleasrDAO got into an epic bidding war for Edward Snowden's [first NFT](https://foundation.app/Snowden/stay-free-edward-snowden-2021-24437) and they won with a final bid of 2,224 ETH (~$4.7M today). Investment clubs have also been called [curators](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/A16NP2XXi9RdHptfdF9WHR0Xq_E1XDmUgMwPmJYOG7w) and I believe they'll be some of the most important stakeholders in the emerging crypto economy. In the past, curators like Vogue, Hypebeast, and TechCrunch decided what was cool and what wasn't. Soon, decentralized curators like PleasrDAO, [$WHALE](https://whale.me/), [SeedClub](https://seedclub.xyz/), [$FWB](https://fwb.help/), and [Flamingo DAO](https://flamingodao.xyz/) will specialize in nice verticals and invest in the highest potential creators, communities, and projects.\n- **Decentralized grant programs**. Pretty much every creator-focused platform in web2 has a creator grant program. [TikTok](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-the-200-million-tiktok-creator-fund), [Snap](https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/spotlight-guidelines), [OnlyFans](https://www.music-news.com/news/Underground/138951/OnlyFans-launches-a-new-fund-to-support-creative-industries-hit-by-the-pandemic), [Substack](https://blog.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers), etc. In web2, these programs are a clever way to acquire top creators, get their audience to join your platform, and retain them over time. But the issue is that these grant programs are opaque and cash-based with little to no equity. I think web3 grant programs will look very different. DeFi protocols like [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-grants-program-v0-1/9081), [Compound](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-grants-program/1292), and [AAVE](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-community-grants-program/3642) have started piloting their own grant programs and I'm excited to watch them evolve. For a creator-focused protocol, a grant program could work like this: creators apply for the grant on a public forum, community members contribute ETH to a pool and receive ERC20 tokens, contributors stake their ERC20s to vote on which creators should receive funding, after a certain time period the top x creators share the pool and are rewarded with protocol tokens so they have skin in the game. There's a lot that needs to be figured out here but the general idea is to make the process more transparent and to give creators more ownership over their work. These days it seems like [every](https://www.tubefilter.com/2021/04/01/tiktokers-investors-josh-richards-griffin-johnson-noah-beck-animal-capital/) [top](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/mrbeasts-management-company-night-media-has-a-new-venture-fund-thats-backed-by-creators/) [creator](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/jake-paul-looks-to-knock-out-the-venture-capital-world-with-anti-fund/) is starting their own VC fund. In web3, I could see this model evolve where top creators start grant programs and allow their community to decide how the funds should be allocated.\n\nOver the past year, creator-focused protocols have been iterating on Creator Mode. I think the next couple years are going to be about transitioning to building tools that enable Org. Mode.\n\nLooking even further ahead, what's after Org. Mode? As your protocol builds tools to help creators and communities start, manage, and scale crypto-native businesses, it becomes time to think about how to decentralize the protocol itself. This brings us to the final boss-level phase: A Protocol Economy.\n\n# Phase Three: A Protocol Economy\n\nIn the Protocol Economy phase, the goal is to:\n\n> *\"Build a community owned and operated protocol with minimal involvement from the initial development team. Ongoing development is driven by community-led committees with active participation from creators, curators, collectors, and a developer ecosystem.\"*\n\nA Protocol Economy is what separates web3 protocols from web2 companies. One of my favorite protocols to study is Yearn. [Insiders describe it](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2021/02/15/love-coordination-at-the-frontier-of-governance-how-yearn-minted-300-million) as a multicellular organism, not a corporation. There's no board of directors. No CEO. No VCs. No HR department. Instead, it started as a solo open source project and evolved into a [\"collective of contributors\"](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/how-we-think-about-yearn/7137/3).\n\nBut, does it *actually* work? Only time will tell, but so far they've coordinated to [make really difficult decisions](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-56-buyback-and-build/8929) without blowing up the community. For example, community members recently voted to increase the protocol's (previously sacred) token supply cap to fund protocol development. They've also [proposed](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/proposal-governance-2-0/10460) one of the most sophisticated decentralized governance systems in all of crypto. (I ***highly*** recommend reading [this](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2021/02/15/love-coordination-at-the-frontier-of-governance-how-yearn-minted-300-million) and [this](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-56-buyback-and-build/8929) to get a sense of their culture)***.*** Today, their protocol token $YFI has a $1.4B market cap. Not bad for what started off as a one-person open source project ten months ago.\n\nAlthough Yearn was a fully decentralized protocol from day one, there's a lot we can learn even if we take a phased approach like the one outlined so far. DeFi protocols like Uniswap and Compound took the phased approach but have began progressively decentralizing over the past few months. They've incorporated best practices from projects like Yearn and developed their own learnings while transitioning to the Protocol Economy phase.\n\nHere's a few key elements creator-focused protocols may want to consider during this phase:\n\n- **A protocol token.** Protocol tokens tend to serve two main functions: currency and [](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2019/2/19/cryptonetwork-governance-as-capital)capital. When a protocol token serves as currency, it's primarily used for consumption, has a short-term focus, high velocity, and is a medium of exchange / unit of account. When a protocol token serves as capital, it's used as a tool to govern, has a long-term focus, low velocity, and is a store of value ([source](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2019/2/19/cryptonetwork-governance-as-capital)). Sometimes, a protocol token switches from one function to another through community governance. For example, Yearn's protocol token, $YFI, was originally viewed as currency. $YFI holders received dividends and many community members were obsessed with the price action. However, some community members realized those funds may be better spent by paying core contributors to improve the protocol. As a result, the community voted to increase the token supply cap and diverted more of the treasury to core contributors instead of speculative token holders. With this change, the protocol token went from currency to capital. In a protocol economy, the token can be about more than just \"number go up\". It can be an instrument for change throughout the protocol. Currency *and* capital. For creator-focused protocols, this capital can be used to share more of the upside with creators. This could align incentives and generate more long-term growth for the protocol. You could end up seeing deals structured similar to a startup employee's compensation package. There could be token lockup periods and vesting schedules. Frankly, I think platforms *should* reward top creators the same way they reward top employees.\n- **Third party developer ecosystem**. In a Protocol Economy, the initial development team can't unilaterally change the protocol. Instead, the protocol will need to set up a ✨ thriving ✨ developer ecosystem with a suite of tools. These include: audited / well-tested smart contracts, documentation describing the entire system, subgraphs to query on-chain data, SDK's for integrating smart contracts, grant programs to fund new projects, bug bounties to improve the protocol, and clear avenues for technical support. One key difference between web2 and web3 is that on-chain data is public. As a result, you could see creator-focused protocols having tens or hundreds of different frontend clients built by third party teams. These clients would use the logic and data from the protocol's smart contracts but could also compose them with other protocol's smart contracts to create something entirely new. It's like if the content and algorithms on Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, etc. were publicly accessible. You could compose and remix functionality in crazy ways. There could be an app that's exclusively focused on helping creators finance new projects based on their on-chain revenue. Or maybe there's a marketplace to help facilitate collabs across different protocols. Lot's of crazy stuff can happen here.\n- **Community-led committees.** By committee, I don't mean those useless committees inside big companies that just meet so they can have free pizza every month. I'm talking about small, focused teams with clear KPI's, domain expertise, and skin in the game. Again, Yearn seems to be leading the way here. Over the past few months, they've noticed a few teams emerge organically. Teams for operations, development, budget control, and big brain energy, to name a few. As a result, community members [proposed](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/proposal-governance-2-0/10460) creating formal \"yTeams\". Each yTeam is empowered to make decisions regarding their domain. Whether it's how to spend the budget, defining the development roadmap, or coming up with new yield farming schemes. Who would've thought that decentralized protocols would *choose* to have so much structure? It reminds me of one of my favorite [quotes](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html) from Vitalik: \"To me, the goal of crypto was never to remove the need for all trust. Rather, the goal of crypto is to give people access to cryptographic and economic building blocks that give people more choice in *whom* to trust\". Community-led committees are chosen by their peers and are a vital force in pushing the protocol forward.\n- **Community benefit programs.** One of the most common arguments against web2 creator-focused platforms is that they take more than they give. To a certain degree, their take rates could be viewed as a form of [taxation without representation](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1374162266287968257?s=20). Of course, web2 platforms provide key services like distribution, tools for content creation, payment processing, etc. But the key question is, *are they taking more than they give*? And who should decide? In web3, the decision is in the hands of the community. In DeFi protocol economies, the most common community benefit program is a grant program. Top protocols allocate around $1M a quarter to projects they deem beneficial to the ecosystem. For creator-focused protocols, I think there's a number of creator-specific community benefit programs that could be interesting. Stuff like [universal creator income](https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class), insurance for smart contract risk, automated wealth management services, p2p zero-interest loans, etc. etc. This is the area I'm most excited to see evolve. I'm confident that communities for creator-focused protocols are going to come up with some insanely creative collective bargaining schemes to ensure they're able to not just succeed as individuals, but to succeed [as a squad](https://otherinter.net/squad-wealth/).\n\nA Protocol Economy is the boss-level phase for creator-focused protocols. But it's also the phase that's radically different from existing platforms. As creators and communities become key contributors to protocol economies, I believe crypto will go from looking like a toy to being recognized as the generation defining movement that it has the potential to be.\n\n# Closing Thoughts\n\nAlthough we walked through the three phases - Creator Mode, Org. Mode, and Protocol Economy - in a specific order, it's still important to have the end-state in mind from the earliest days of protocol development. Who you hire. Who you attract as the first customers and community members. What your website copy says. Early decisions impact your ability to move through the other phases.\n\nSo, how might \"come for the creator, stay for the economy\" end up looking in practice? \n\nIn a few years, I imagine people flocking to a creator-focused protocol because one of their favorite creators recently joined. As they build a reputation on the protocol, they may qualify to apply for a monthly stipend from the treasury to quit their job and become a full-time content creator. Or maybe they want to deposit their crypto into the community's automated wealth management system. Or maybe they raise an investment fund from the protocol treasury based on their reputation as a curator. In mature creator-focused protocols, I believe there will be emergent opportunities like these for creators, curators, community leaders, developers, protocol politicians, and passive consumers alike.\n\nThey come for the creator, but stay for the economy.\n\nAt a superficial level, they're bound by the protocol token. On a deeper level, they're bound by the desire to succeed *together*. The heart and soul of these economies isn't an invisible hand driven solely by self-interest. Nope. Instead, it's the [feathered dinosaur](https://twitter.com/tracheopteryx) that's a community leader on a mission \"to cohere & align collective intelligence\". It's the [bunny](https://twitter.com/bantg) that ships code like his life depends on it. It's the bag holders that donated 10% of their earnings back to the protocol to fund future development.\n\nIt's a new type of economy.\n\n---\n\nShoutout to [Denis](https://twitter.com/Iiterature), [Graeme](https://twitter.com/strangechances), and [Jon-Kyle](https://twitter.com/jondashkyle) for discussions that led to these thoughts.", "timestamp": 1618940185, "digest": "1EpvJwUpx_KlRcHOKLNqADEkwHL_Z1ZYKobF2uLwgBg", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}

Now, we may have begun the shift toward a new model of the Internet, where genuine appreciation and fair compensation for digital art is possible.\n\nI've always been disappointed to see my real-time, generative work reduced to a video or still image. In its true form my work never exists in the same state twice, making the experience of viewing the work fluid and fleeting, and engaging the viewer’s attention in a way that a still image, or video cannot. So I have often felt confined by having to translate my work into a different medium than it was originally intended to be viewed.\n\nNFTs can only be viewed on the web. They are created as purely digital objects. The web itself is a rich ecosystem of technologies that can be chained together to create dynamic, interactive experiences. It makes sense that NFTs should leverage the power of the web, instead of being limited to still images or videos. The power of the blockchain has also opened up the potential for artworks to contain dynamic information about their own context, ownership, and variables from the external world.\n\nUnfortunately, the major platforms for viewing and collecting NFTs have limited capacity for displaying alternative types of work: they offer few options beyond image or video files. That limitation, along with my disappointment with the available tools, motivated me to create my own series of 1-of-1, generative, browser-based NFTs. \n\n>When you’re limited by other people’s tools, sometimes you must build your own.\n\n[Solvency #5](https://solvency.art/view/5?fullscreen=true&embed=true&display=iframe&size=large)\n\n*If viewing on Safari, enable WebGL 2 in Developer -> Experimental Features*\n\n[Solvency](https://solvency.art/) consists of four major components: the smart contract, the front-end code, the random seed, and the back-end. The smart contract determines the work’s mechanics. I collaborated with software engineer [Steve Klebanoff](https://twitter.com/steveklbnf) to produce a bespoke smart contract that handles the logic for minting each piece. \n\nEach piece in the series is simply a digital token. After a token is purchased, information from that transaction generates the work of art. Conventionally, image or video files are linked via metadata to this token within a smart contract. In theory, this metadata can contain any type of media, which means that NFTs are not limited to images and videos. **The media associated with Solvency tokens are dynamic WebGL simulations.** These simulations are feedback loops made of multiple shaders that render particles which drive the movement and form of layers of moving color and texture across the screen. The textures themselves were generated using a [GAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) trained on 35mm photographs I’ve taken over the last few years. I grouped these generated images into categories like ‘Flowers’ or ‘City.’ I also hand-selected certain combinations of values that generate particle formations within the simulation such as ‘Veins’ or ‘Smoke.’ The result is that each artwork is unique, with a wide potential for aesthetic variation, but sharing properties that produce a thematic series.\n\nIn the Solvency smart contract, a pseudo-random function generates a hash associated for each minted token, which is used to seed a deterministic random number generator. Deterministic simply means that these randomly generated values will always be the same, given the same input hash, so that the artwork will always render in the same way after it has been created. The values generated by the random number generator control the parameters of the simulation, as well as the selection of image textures that drive the color and composition of the piece. Some tokens contain combinations of textures and forms that occur less frequently than others. The piece doesn't exist until it's minted. Because of the random distribution of attributes there’s no guarantee that a certain rare attribute will exist in any of the pieces after they’ve all been minted. The smart contract points to an Arweave hash that represents a permanent copy of the front-end viewer hosted on the [Arweave blockchain](https://www.arweave.org/).\n\nIn addition to the main WebGL artwork, I opted to render each piece into video and image formats, because collectors should be able to see their artwork on the parts of the web that don’t support the real-time WebGL version, such as [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) or mobile devices. One of the challenges of Solvency was to create a backend that could automatically render artwork that had never existed before being minted. I needed to add automation to avoid manually rendering videos for all of the artworks. To do this required a significant amount of experimentation, given that the tools for rendering video on the web, especially from WebGL, are limited. Many moving parts had to be connected to create a seamless data flow between automated processes. Detailed technical discussion of the backend goes outside of the scope of this essay.\n\nThe artwork is stored on an HTTP server, and “permanently” on the Arweave blockchain. When you access the front end website at solvency.art, you're viewing a version of the work hosted on Vercel’s servers. Each piece directly links out to a streamlined version of the website, hosted on Arweave, which will render the exact same version of any Solvency piece given its token hash seed. In the case of the Arweave website, all scripts and textures are hosted on Arweave’s blockchain. If solvency.art ever went down, all pieces could still be viewed on Arweave.\n\nFor technology to improve, it must simultaneously break itself. Software becomes outmoded, deprecated, or vulnerable to security threats. Hardware becomes more performant, capable, and incompatible with older tools. It's nearly impossible to permanently archive a website (most rarely last more than 2 or 3 years) but we can try our best to conserve them for as long as possible. Digital artists will never have complete control over the software they use. Even the lowest level software depends on third parties beyond the artist’s control—packages, libraries, browsers, operating systems, compilers.\n\nBy creating an NFT built inside of a WebGL canvas, I'm making assumptions: that WebGL will continue to exist as a browser-based API, that computers will be able to run the code, and that the code is future-proof. I’m also assuming that both the Arweave and Ethereum blockchains will persist.\n\nAll works of art are built on assumptions, having to do with the potential endurance of media, e.g. canvas, paper, videotape, plastic. Artists have typically not put the concern about the longevity of materials first in their thoughts, convinced that *ars lunga, vita brevis* was sufficient reason to pitch something into the sea of time, in hopes that it would last a long time, if not ‘forever.’ It would be interesting to calculate the sheer number of works of art disappeared, deteriorated, lost to the elements, and rendered null by time—NFTs will be no exception. Art museums and collectors, armed with their expert restorers and conservators, are forever fighting against the material destinies of their collections. Often modern works, enabled by certain technological breakthroughs, become the hardest to maintain.\n\nBy fighting to preserve something, whether it be a digital file, a building, a painting, a state of being, we are fighting against the natural tendency of all organized collections of matter to move toward chaos - the tendency of entropy. Entropy is the fundamental law of the universe that measures disorder and uncertainty within any given system. Generative art and entropy run in parallel. How to create something that is at once dynamic yet never-ending, visually enticing at any given moment yet always in a state of flux, an ever-changing image, always rearranging and redrawing itself? To do so it is necessary to embrace the tendency of systems to dissolve, and move toward chaos—towards an equilibrium that can't be reversed. There is no 'undo' button in a time-based feedback loop, only the present moment and the next one. This condition of entropy is fundamental to both the tools, and the aesthetic language with which Solvency is built.\n\n*Solvency will be open to the public at 1pm EST on Thursday April 22nd.

The smart contract determines the work’s mechanics. I collaborated with software engineer [Steve Klebanoff](https://twitter.com/steveklbnf) to produce a bespoke smart contract that handles the logic for minting each piece. \n\nEach piece in the series is simply a digital token. After a token is purchased, information from that transaction generates the work of art. Conventionally, image or video files are linked via metadata to this token within a smart contract. In theory, this metadata can contain any type of media, which means that NFTs are not limited to images and videos. **The media associated with Solvency tokens are dynamic WebGL simulations.** These simulations are feedback loops made of multiple shaders that render particles which drive the movement and form of layers of moving color and texture across the screen. The textures themselves were generated using a [GAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) trained on 35mm photographs I’ve taken over the last few years. I grouped these generated images into categories like ‘Flowers’ or ‘City.’ I also hand-selected certain combinations of values that generate particle formations within the simulation such as ‘Veins’ or ‘Smoke.’ The result is that each artwork is unique, with a wide potential for aesthetic variation, but sharing properties that produce a thematic series.\n\nIn the Solvency smart contract, a pseudo-random function generates a hash associated for each minted token, which is used to seed a deterministic random number generator. Deterministic simply means that these randomly generated values will always be the same, given the same input hash, so that the artwork will always render in the same way after it has been created. The values generated by the random number generator control the parameters of the simulation, as well as the selection of image textures that drive the color and composition of the piece. Some tokens contain combinations of textures and forms that occur less frequently than others. The piece doesn't exist until it's minted. Because of the random distribution of attributes there’s no guarantee that a certain rare attribute will exist in any of the pieces after they’ve all been minted. The smart contract points to an Arweave hash that represents a permanent copy of the front-end viewer hosted on the [Arweave blockchain](https://www.arweave.org/).\n\nIn addition to the main WebGL artwork, I opted to render each piece into video and image formats, because collectors should be able to see their artwork on the parts of the web that don’t support the real-time WebGL version, such as [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) or mobile devices. One of the challenges of Solvency was to create a backend that could automatically render artwork that had never existed before being minted. I needed to add automation to avoid manually rendering videos for all of the artworks. To do this required a significant amount of experimentation, given that the tools for rendering video on the web, especially from WebGL, are limited.

In the case of the Arweave website, all scripts and textures are hosted on Arweave’s blockchain. If solvency.art ever went down, all pieces could still be viewed on Arweave.\n\nFor technology to improve, it must simultaneously break itself.

Artists have typically not put the concern about the longevity of materials first in their thoughts, convinced that *ars lunga, vita brevis* was sufficient reason to pitch something into the sea of time, in hopes that it would last a long time, if not ‘forever.’ It would be interesting to calculate the sheer number of works of art disappeared, deteriorated, lost to the elements, and rendered null by time—NFTs will be no exception. Art museums and collectors, armed with their expert restorers and conservators, are forever fighting against the material destinies of their collections. Often modern works, enabled by certain technological breakthroughs, become the hardest to maintain.\n\nBy fighting to preserve something, whether it be a digital file, a building, a painting, a state of being, we are fighting against the natural tendency of all organized collections of matter to move toward chaos - the tendency of entropy. Entropy is the fundamental law of the universe that measures disorder and uncertainty within any given system. Generative art and entropy run in parallel. How to create something that is at once dynamic yet never-ending, visually enticing at any given moment yet always in a state of flux, an ever-changing image, always rearranging and redrawing itself? To do so it is necessary to embrace the tendency of systems to dissolve, and move toward chaos—towards an equilibrium that can't be reversed. There is no 'undo' button in a time-based feedback loop, only the present moment and the next one. This condition of entropy is fundamental to both the tools, and the aesthetic language with which Solvency is built.\n\n*Solvency will be open to the public at 1pm EST on Thursday April 22nd. Each Solvency piece will cost 0.4 ETH, with a maximum of 500 pieces able to be minted.

I studied Finance but after a few internships, I realized I wasn’t meant to be in a cheap suit from JCPenny cranking out discounted cash flow models until midnight. At the time, a friend of mine had just finished a coding bootcamp and suggested I try learning to code.\n\nIt was my senior year so like any rational person, I decided to stop going to class so I could code all day (sorry mom). Over the next few months I picked up web development, built full-stack apps, and did so many [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems that you’d think it was a form of capital punishment. \n\nOnce I graduated, I bought a one-way ticket to San Francisco and stayed on a cozy air mattress in my friend’s living room. Over the next few months, I did some contract work for my friends at [Career Karma](http://careerkarma.com/) and eventually landed a job as a software engineer on the growth team at [Instacart](instacart.com).\n\nA little over a year later, I was looking to work at an early stage startup so I got in touch with a [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) startup called [Dharma](http://dharma.io/). I had no clue what DeFi was but it was using this crypto thing I vaguely remembered hearing about a while back. After speaking with the team about their vision for a decentralized bank, I was red pilled.\n\nI joined the team but started having imposter syndrome in my first meeting. They talked about counterfactuals, meta transactions, proxy contracts, on-chain this and off-chain that. After the meeting, I had a mini dictionary worth of terms to look up on Wikipedia that night. Then we got to lunch and the entire team passionately debated token economics, incentive structures, governance mechanisms, and all this other stuff I had no clue about. I quickly realized this crypto thing wasn’t just slightly different than existing systems. It was completely different.\n\nOne of my favorite things about crypto is that it’s not just a technology. It’s a philosophy. It’s a belief system. It’s a way of viewing the world. It’s about questioning conventional systems and not caring if everyone else thinks you’re batshit crazy.\n\nOver the next few months, I learned more about cryptonetworks and how they worked under the hood. I remember the “aha moment” when I wrote my first smart contract. With just a few lines of code and a private key, I was able to transfer an internet-native currency anywhere in the world in seconds. \n\nI didn’t have to sign up for Stripe. I didn’t have to use the Plaid API to connect a bank account. I didn’t have to check if TransferWise supported payments for a specific country. There was no centralized party. Just a peer-to-peer cryptonetwork called Ethereum. It was pretty damn mindblowing.\n\nAfter the first few weeks at Dharma, I was confident that DeFi and crypto were the future. But I also got the itch to work on some of my own ideas. I wanted to build software for creative people. Writers. Artists. Musicians. Online teachers. I strongly believe our world depends on these types of people having the tools they need to serve their communities as best they can.\n\nFrankly, I also thought it would take a couple years before the crypto industry had the infrastructure in place for a mainstream consumer app to be built.\n\n\nSo I ended up leaving Dharma to take some time off and explore a few startup ideas. But a couple months ago I read a [manifesto](https://cryptomedia.wtf/) by [Zora](https://zora.co/) that changed how I thought about crypto.\n\nIt described a world where crypto could be used to give any digital media file (eg an image, a song, an essay, digital art, etc.) property rights. It explained how cryptonetworks could turn digital media into liquid financial assets, secured through cryptography, and programmable through smart contracts.\n\nAlthough the individual ideas weren’t new, they were combined and articulated in a way that just made sense. And not just to me.\n\n[Digital artists](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-nfts/insight-how-a-10-second-video-clip-sold-for-6-6-million-idUKL8N2KV6X9), [athletes](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/28/230-million-dollars-spent-on-nba-top-shot.html), [social media influencers](https://cryptoslate.com/logan-paul-nfts-sell-3-5-million-worth-on-first-day-of-release/), [tech executives](https://scottbelsky.medium.com/the-furry-lisa-cryptoart-the-new-economy-of-digital-creativity-6cb2300ea081), [media executives](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI), and [journalists](https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1366554892035219462) that never took the crypto weirdos seriously, seem to be taking notice.\n\nBut let’s be real. Is this latest NFT craze a bubble? Probz. Yet, is there at least a kernel of value in the idea of ownership over creative work? I think so.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nWell, there’s been a lot of talk about high transaction fees and lack of scalability in these systems. Although I do think these problems should and will get fixed, a lack of technical scalability is kinda the point.\n\nCryptonetworks trade off technical scalability for social scalability.\n\nFacebook is technically scalable because it’s a social network that processes millions of transactions per second. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is socially scalable because it’s a trillion dollar economic network without a centralized authority.\n\nCrypto isn’t just a technological revolution. It’s also a revolution in capital formation and human coordination. How creative projects are funded. How groups of people are incentivized. How organizations are structured.\n\nYears from now, when I’m old and senile, I believe we’ll look back at this period as an [Internet Renaissance](https://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1343210395704541189) of sorts. \n\nA time where we dared to fight back against systems that have been designed for centuries to elevate certain groups and keep others disenfranchised.\n\nWho knows though. Maybe all this crypto stuff really is just an intellectual ideal that’ll never work in practice. Regardless, I think it’s at least worth trying.", "timestamp": 1618971171, "digest": "pl07RMWdJZktHUAn8hZ02YlO35-Ju49orPrhaRnn4Vo", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}

Founders are almost always visionaries (if they aren’t, run in the opposite direction) and hired CEOs are almost always operators.\n\nWhat this VC was saying is that once you replace visionary leadership with operational leadership, the Company will stop innovating and start to lose value. I agree completely that companies that stop innovating will start to lose value. What I don’t agree with and have seen first hand, is that you can have a team that can provide both operational and visionary leadership.\n\nLeaders who can provide both operational and visionary leadership are a rare but special breed. When you find one, get on their bus and stay on it for as long as you can. It will be an incredible trip.\n\nIt is also the case that you can pair visionary leadership with operational leadership and I have seen that model work very well for long periods of time. Most commonly, the visionary leader is “in charge” and the operational leader runs the business on a day to day period. That can be an Executive Chairman (visionary) and a CEO (operator) or it can be a CEO (visionary) and President/COO (operator). Most commonly in this model, the visionary leader is the founder and the operator is a hired executive.\n\nSmall early-stage companies can succeed without operational leadership but not forever. That is why founders who are great visionaries but weak operationally can be very successful for a while at least. Once a company gets into the hundreds of employees and is headed to the thousands, it needs operational leadership and this is where many visionary founders struggle. And this is when operational leaders are hired and the work starts to find the right long-term sustainable operating model.\n\nSome founders are this rare breed of visionaries who can operate too. Most are not. So this work to find the right pairing is critical and is a lot of the work that board members do with the founders and their leadership team in startups.\n\nBut going back to my friend and his advice that I started this post with, it is true that operational leadership alone will not get the job done. And it is also true that operational leaders will have a hard time getting “the vision thing” from below. It has to come from the top. Operational leadership, fortunately, does not.\n", "timestamp": 1619000439, "digest": "i-RXJwhoolS8aM197Q_LDJnqcTZz3d0x40cAFUalOLw", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

Among the programs was Federal Project Number One, which devoted $27 million—roughly $522 million today—to provide employment for tens of thousands of artists across music, design, visual art, theater, writing, and more. As the largest instance of government patronage of the arts, the program also sought to make art accessible to the wider community and to create a new American style of art.\n\nThese programs employed some of the 20th century’s most celebrated [artists](https://mymodernmet.com/wpa-federal-art-project/), including Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Lee Krasner, and Mark Rothko, and yielded over 100,000 works, including murals, sculptures, and paintings. The Federal Art Project aimed to be inclusive of artists of varying experience levels and allowed wide latitude in subject matters and styles, with program director Holger Cahill declaring, “Anything painted by an American artist is American art.”\n\nBeyond providing relief to unemployed artists, the programs were designed to “ameliorate growing discontent and inspire civic feeling” ([source](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo19909836.html)). Importantly, they shifted the perception of art from a luxury good financed through private patronage to an essential part of what constituted a democracy. Art became accessible to all and woven into the fabric of public spaces, versus limited to rarefied circles. The role of the artist became validated as an essential part of the economy and community, as opposed to a frivolous hobbyist.\n\n\n![“The Bauxite Mines” by Julius Woeltz for the Benton, AR post office](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a66d888e-6bfd-46ef-9999-bf7bc45f2851.jpeg?height=394&width=800)\n\n\nNearly a century later, it’s time to renew that spirit. The present day mirrors the 1930s New Deal-era in many ways, with widespread job loss, a broad sense of burnout, and a need to bridge divides across communities. Importantly, COVID-19 has exacerbated income inequality to levels not seen since the Gilded Age—the top 1% of Americans now hold [30.4%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2020/10/08/top-1-of-us-households-hold-15-times-more-wealth-than-bottom-50-combined/?sh=651adbd55179) of all household wealth—with low-income workers, women, and minority groups disproportionately suffering job loss and health risks. After this economic collapse, as after the Great Depression, we ought to explore ways to support recovery, especially for the most vulnerable groups.\n\n## **Universal Creative Income (UCI)**\n\nToday, the financial precarity associated with creative professions means that those who pursue art are typically well off: someone whose family has an income of $100,000 is [twice as likely](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/wealth-strong-predictor-whether-individual-pursues-creative-profession-180972072/) to become an artist, actor, musician, or author than someone from a family with $50,000 income. And those from households with an annual income of $1 million are *10 times* more likely to become artists than those from families with a $100,000 income. *Money*’s Kristen Bahler [wrote](https://money.com/rich-people-get-more-creative-jobs/), “Devoting yourself to the life of a ‘starving artist’ is a lot less risky if your family has enough money to make sure you don’t actually starve.” This uneven opportunity landscape remains true in the world of online content creation: a 2013 [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcc4.12042) in the *Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication* found that “online content creators tend to be from relatively privileged groups and the content of online services based on their contributions may be biased towards what is most interesting or relevant to them.”\n\nDespite the democratization of creative tools and platforms and the lower barriers to becoming a creator on the internet, financial success is concentrated among just a small segment of top creators, and the [middle class](https://li.substack.com/p/building-the-middle-class-of-the) of the creator economy remains elusive.\n\n## **Platform-provided UCI**\n\nIn some ways, creative works on the internet resemble public goods: they are nonexcludable (a user cannot exclude others from consuming the good) and nonrivalrous (one’s usage of the good does not prevent others from consuming it). When creators post a video on TikTok or write a tweetstorm, the entire world can consume and benefit from them. The content can provide entertainment, connection, and edification, spark new insights, and have positive externalities. Consumers value the content, but it’s infeasible to charge for it—unless the creator puts up a paywall and turns the public good into a club good.\n\n![Source: https://boycewire.com/public-goods-definition-and-examples/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/076c7d81-3e90-491d-8849-1d386947d5e6.jpeg?height=350&width=600)\n\n\n\nGovernment spending is one way to provide public goods, but not the only way. In line with the notion of the [net state](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/news/qa-alexis-wichowski-discusses-growing-power-%E2%80%9Cnet-states%E2%80%9D)—in which our economic and cultural lives are increasingly shaped by tech companies that rival nation-states in their power and capital—technology platforms are another potential source of funding for these creative workers.\n\nTech companies commonly compare themselves to digital public spaces: Mark Zuckerberg [wrote](https://www.facebook.com/notes/2420600258234172/) in 2019 that Facebook and Instagram were “the digital equivalent of a town square,” and Jack Dorsey has referred to Twitter as a “[digital public square](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1037399093084151808).” In the physical world, public spaces are typically funded through a combination of local, state, and federal funding; for tech platforms, funding emerging creators can be a form of investing and supporting those who contribute to the vitality of digital town squares.\n\n**In the digital world, user rights are civic rights, and creator rights are worker rights.** Today, creator-workers have little voice over their compensation, protections, and labor practices. Platform-sponsored basic income for creators would be one step towards facilitating a more worker-friendly environment. In turn, a richer and more diverse content environment would enhance the consumer experience.\n\nI introduced the idea of a platform-sponsored Universal Creative Income (UCI) in my December essay about the need to support a [creator middle class](https://li.substack.com/p/building-the-middle-class-of-the), outlining platform UCI as a possible solution to support emerging creators.\n\n> Providing creators with a basic income may be a wise strategy to incentivize more creators to devote more time to content creation. TikTok’s Creator Fund announcement echoes this sentiment: “The U.S. fund will start with $200 million to help support ambitious creators who are seeking opportunities to foster a livelihood through their innovative content.”\n\nGuaranteed income would enable individuals to spend more time on creative pursuits, rather than worrying about being able to meet basic needs. Successful implementation of UCI would bring improvements in creator stress and mental health, and create a more equitable path for a more diverse array of creators to be able to pursue content creation as a career.\n\nFor platforms, the idea is simple: **use company revenue to fund a Universal Creative Income program for emerging creators on the platform**. For instance, companies like Facebook or YouTube could carve out a fund to support creators on the platform and send them a monthly check to cover basic living expenses, regardless of skill, training, or background. UCI differs from most prevailing platform creator funds in terms of consistency of payments, transparency of eligibility criteria, and focus on smaller emerging creators. To the last point: we believe focusing on creators who are in the greatest financial need would create the largest impact on participation in the creator economy.\n\n### **Platform benefits of UCI**\n\nWhile UCI may appear to be predicated on altruism on the part of companies, there are tangible business benefits that could make such a program a worthwhile investment. UCI can better align creator and platform incentives, and drive downstream user engagement and retention.\n\n**1. Compete for creators**. Implementing a UCI program allows platforms to attract creators in an era in which every social platform is fiercely competing for creator attention. There has been a steady drumbeat of new creator funding initiatives, signifiers of the battle to win over creators. The [TikTok Creator Fund](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-the-200-million-tiktok-creator-fund) was announced in summer 2020, committing to award $1 billion to creators in the US in the next 3 years, and [Snap Spotlight](https://investor.snap.com/news/news-details/2020/Snap-Inc.-Launches-Spotlight-a-New-Entertainment-Platform-for-User-Generated-Content-within-Snapchat/default.aspx)—which pays out $1 million daily—followed suit just months later. While these programs are a step in the right direction for compensating creators, the distribution of funds is correlated with success, making them financially meaningful only to the superstars on each platform. A UCI program can be beneficial in attracting and retaining a much larger population of creators.\n\n**2. Empower more diverse creators to participate in the creator economy**. Just as unpaid internships [exclude](https://www.epi.org/blog/unpaid-internships-economic-mobility/) students from lower-income backgrounds who cannot afford to work for free, the current paradigm in the creator economy of amassing an audience through free content before eventually monetizing locks out creators who are less able to take financial risks.\n\n**Our hypothesis is that funding the long-tail of creators can create more long-term business impact than funding top creators who can already monetize in myriad ways and are highly sought after by many platforms.** A UCI program targeted at emerging creators can engender more creator loyalty and build a proprietary acquisition channel for the next generation of talent. A recent example of a platform initiative targeting emerging creators is Pinterest’s newly-announced [Creator Fund](https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/creatorcode), which is explicitly focused on underrepresented communities who acutely need financial and creative resources: “we saw a need to uplift Creators and communities that have been disproportionately underrepresented on the platform.”\n\nAlexis Wichowski in *[The Information Trade](https://www.amazon.com/Information-Trade-Countries-Challenges-Transforms/dp/0062888986) writes*, “The digital realm needs to stay ‘healthy’ in order to keep users there. It’s in net states’ best interests to invest in the health of that ecosystem.” UCI can foster a healthier ecosystem by financially assisting emerging creators—ultimately leading to more user engagement and a richer content ecosystem on the platform.\n\n**3. Retain creators throughout their entire lifecycles**. For creators, an early decision they make is choosing a platform to begin creating content on. A UCI program could tip the scales in favor of a platform, encouraging creators to begin their content creation on that ecosystem. From there, it’s easier to retain creators as they grow and progress in their lifecycles. For creators who develop familiarity with product features and build a following on the platform, there’s added lock-in that translates into increased retention.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b01c71bb-483c-483b-8ffd-3447c14be691.png?height=405&width=720)\n\n\n**4. Counteract resentment among smaller creators**. From our conversations with emerging creators, there’s often a sense that platforms prioritize top creators, granting them preferential treatment, lower take rates, and greater visibility and promotion. A platform-sponsored UCI would counteract that perception, demonstrating to emerging creators that they are a valued part of the ecosystem.\n\nIn short, UCI functions like any business investment: the benefits of a UCI program, in the form of acquiring more creators and fostering a more vibrant ecosystem of content, should exceed the cost of implementing such a program.\n\n### **Creator benefits for UCI**\n\n**1. Encourage experimentation and creativity**. Research on the interplay between creativity and social vs. financial rewards has [found](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/44/3/536/3738819) that social recognition—which drives much of the online creator economy—induces conformity, whereas financial rewards boost originality. UCI could encourage creators to experiment and take on bigger risks with their content, tackling new and diverse topics without fear of alienating their audience or underperforming.\n\n**2. Improve creator wellness**. Hunter Walk recently [wrote](https://hunterwalk.medium.com/instagram-youtube-tiktok-are-burning-out-their-creators-heres-how-to-fix-that-7298dcfbd055) that \"being a modern creator is, for many, exhausting,\" since social media platforms reward content velocity. UCI can encourage more balance and ward off creator burnout. A 1970s [universal basic income (UBI) experiment](https://www.chatelaine.com/news/universal-basic-income-canada-faq/) gave a group of Manitoba, Canada residents a guaranteed income for a five-year period; as a result, women took more time off for maternity leave and more students completed high school. By removing concerns over meeting basic needs, UCI can similarly afford creators the ability to make decisions that optimize for long-term benefits.\n\n**3. Bridge the gap from side hustle to main hustle**. A familiar milestone for any employee-turned-creator is the anxiety surrounding the initial plunge into creating full-time—and the associated initial pay cut. UCI can help more creators make the transition from side hustle to main hustle by smoothing income as creators navigate finding [creator-market fit](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1376393732610785283).\n\nThe net impact of UCI would be more content creators—including those who otherwise would not have taken the risk to become creators—and a higher-quality, more diverse content ecosystem. Substack echoed these benefits in their blog post explaining the [Substack Pro program](https://blog.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers), their advance payments program for writers:\n\n> We like this structure because, while some who get these deals are already well off, it gives financially constrained writers the ability to start building a sustainable enterprise. We take most of the risk for them. In return, their work contributes to the quality of the Substack ecosystem and they become long-term customers.\n\n### **What are the risks of platform UCI?**\n\nHaving tech platforms sponsor UCI programs is not without risk. It moves us from the real-world paradigm in which governments and central banks have absolute power over money, to an online world in which platforms have greater control over the livelihoods of emerging artists.\n\nFor creators in the UCI program, being a beneficiary increases dependency on a single company that maintains power to make unilateral decisions about payment amounts, program eligibility, etc. Unlike a government-sponsored UBI, there’s no democratic process to get the consent of the stakeholders in the design of platform UCI.\n\nAnother major potential downside is stifling innovation. While established, profitable companies are able to fund UCI, it’s infeasible for early-stage startups to do the same. Startups would be less financially attractive to emerging creators, who may increasingly opt to create on platforms that offer UCI. Just as the New Deal was part of a cultural agenda to Americanize art and create a sense of shared national identity, platform-sponsored UCI could similarly “platformize” art, making certain formats more widely accepted and valued and entrenching platforms’ lock-in.\n\nA platform-funded UCI program could also be controversial among top creators, because it is effectively redistribution within the platform’s economy: a share of the platform’s revenue—which is disproportionately earned from the top creators—would be allocated to emerging creators. In the real world, the political resistance to UBI stems, in part, from the increase in taxes necessary to fund it. Residents already take into taxation in deciding [where to live](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2020/09/24/bay-area-wealthy-moving-with-urgency-ahead-of-expe.html). The parallel in the creator economy is that top creators can move elsewhere—taking their audiences with them—in order to avoid platform take rates that go toward subsidizing UCI.\n\nIt’s worth noting, however, that platform-sponsored UCI could promote a net increase in the accessibility of being an online creator as a career. And to-date, a lack of monetization features has not hindered new startups (e.g. Clubhouse for the first year) from attracting creators.\n\n### **How to implement platform UCI**\n\n1. Platform calculates a share of its revenue that it can allocate to a UCI program, as well as decides on the segment of creators it would like to target and criteria for determining eligibility. The criteria would be determined based on business goals, for instance, targeting creators for whom regular cash payments would have the greatest marginal utility and generate the most incremental new creation activity. This eligibility criteria would also serve to distinguish aspiring, emerging creators from regular consumer users.\n2. Once a creator hits the eligibility criteria, they can elect to begin receiving UCI payments. The company sends creators a monthly check for a standard amount for UCI.\n3. At the end of 12 months (or a predetermined length of time), the creator is phased out of UCI. The time-bound nature of the program is intentional, so that every emerging creator gets a shot, but limits the scope of the program so that platforms don’t have to subsidize every long-tail creator forever.\n4. Platform assesses the UCI program’s results against business objectives (e.g. original content creation, engagement, retention) and iterates from there.\n\n## **Crypto UCI**\n\nAs an alternative to platform-funded UCI, crypto could also be used to implement more transparent and democratic forms of artist funding. In a [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=165EfOwRVkw) conversation, Collab.Land founder James Young describes a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that could sell fractionalized NFTs and use the proceeds to fund grants for emerging artists, who would, in turn, give the organization a portion of their social tokens as a form of collateral.\n\nAnother implementation could be that a community treasury could use a portion of its holdings to fund a UCI program. It would function similarly to the platform UCI outlined above, but rather than a centralized company making unilateral decisions about UCI, users and creators of the DAO would participate in governance decisions, including the mechanics of the basic income program for creators.\n\nThe downsides of using crypto to fund artists are greater complexity and new behavior changes: creators would need to have crypto wallets and learn how to transfer cryptocurrencies into fiat (to buy materials, pay for food, rent, etc.). If UCI is targeted at the lowest income creators, it’s a segment that is less likely to be familiar with the mechanics underlying a crypto UCI program and requires more onboarding and education.\n\nReturning to the New Deal, crypto UCI has the potential to renew the democratic spirit of the Federal Art Project. Just as the Federal Art Project employed artists whose work was [installed](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/new-deal-federal-art-project-support-arts-coronavirus-1202684330/) in public spaces like schools, hospitals, and libraries, new crypto business models like NFTs and crowdfunds can enable creators to monetize while still preserving public access to their work. An ARTnews column [contrasts](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/new-deal-federal-art-project-support-arts-coronavirus-1202684330/), \"If the commercialization of art was accompanied by its dislocation in galleries, museums, and private homes [...] then the FAP sought a more inclusive understanding and appreciation of culture by endeavoring to integrate art with everyday experience.” Crypto UCI can combat the dislocation of content, moving it from walled gardens to more open ecosystems where creators have more control over their businesses and consumers can have more access to information.\n\nThough platform-funded UCI and crypto UCI may appear ideologically opposed, they are not mutually exclusive. Web2 and Web3 solutions can and will live in tandem: crypto UCI can be a great funding mechanism for creators with community recognition, but for a brand new creator, the distribution potential of Web2 aggregators is currently unparalleled.\n\n## **From UCI to UBI**\n\nBeyond just funding creators, there could be benefits for expanding basic income to a wider swath of the population. **Universal Basic Income (UBI) can be a hidden form of creator funding, freeing more people to be more creative and innovative**. Research shows that children from high-income (top 1%) families are [ten times as likely](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24062) to become inventors as those from below-median income families; moreover, downstream product innovation also disproportionately [benefits](https://scholar.harvard.edu/xavier/paper-1) higher-income households.\n\nIn the 2020 election, presidential candidate Andrew Yang called for giving every American adult a basic income of $1,000 every month, with one of the stated benefits being to enable people to “[be more creative](https://2020.yang2020.com/policies/the-freedom-dividend/).” Today, support for UBI is especially popular among young people: adults under age 30 favor the government providing a UBI by roughly [two-to-one](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/19/more-americans-oppose-than-favor-the-government-providing-a-universal-basic-income-for-all-adult-citizens/). Despite this recent popularization of UBI, the idea of a guaranteed income has a long-standing history: [Napoleon](https://www.investopedia.com/news/history-of-universal-basic-income/), [Thomas Paine](https://basicincometoday.com/thomas-paines-centuries-old-argument-for-ubi-as-a-right/), and [Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/08/martin-luther-kings-economic-dream-a-guaranteed-income-for-all-americans/279147/) all expressed support for some form of cash handout or base compensation.\n\nDespite the benefits of UBI, the US may not have the political will to enact such a program anytime soon. UBI Research is a think tank that explores possible implementations of *government-independent* UBI; many of its compiled [projects](https://ubiresearch.org/projects) are crypto-based. For instance, [UBI](https://blog.kleros.io/introducing-ubi-universal-basic-income-for-humans/) is a crypto project that continuously [streams](https://twitter.com/scottsantens/status/1377334493640499203?s=20) $UBI tokens to successfully verified members, who have been registered as unique humans on [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/), a social identity system for humans on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n## **The future of digital creative life**\n\nBeyond providing employment for artists, the New Deal had a larger mission: to promote what Franklin D. Roosevelt called \"a more abundant life.\" New Deal cultural programs enabled countless Americans to see original artwork for the first time, attend their first live theater show, and attend educational programming at community centers around the country.\n\nToday, social media platforms likewise enable consumers to access a multitude of creative work at no expense to themselves, but the advertising model and digital nature of content have undermined the economic viability of content creation online. The end result is that the creator economy resembles an economy of superstars, and the vast majority of creators are struggling to make ends meet—and all creators are building on a shaky foundation as their ability to reach audiences and earn income is dictated by a small handful of companies.\n\nThough crypto holds promise for platforms to be more open and transparent and for users to directly own and participate in the upside of the underlying platform, there’s already a power-law distribution emerging for creators. On NFT marketplaces, the top 1% of artists account for [48% of sales](https://justincone.com/posts/nft-skeptics-guide/). It’s a power law dynamic that mirrors the traditional art world, in which the top 1% of artists account for [64% of auction sales](https://d2u3kfwd92fzu7.cloudfront.net/Art%20Basel%20and%20UBS_The%20Art%20Market_2018.pdf).\n\nWith pandemic-induced job insecurity and heightening income inequality, it is more pressing than ever to enact programs that create broader on-ramps for creator success. **As we spend more of our lives in digital town squares, it’s important to foster a healthier ecosystem in these online cities, with stronger civic activity, democratic decision-making, funding for public works, and an economy with a robust creator middle class.** Universal Creative Income can be a step in this direction.\n\n---\n\n*We hope that the ideas and solutions outlined in this essay are considered starting points in a longer conversation.

Among the programs was Federal Project Number One, which devoted $27 million—roughly $522 million today—to provide employment for tens of thousands of artists across music, design, visual art, theater, writing, and more. As the largest instance of government patronage of the arts, the program also sought to make art accessible to the wider community and to create a new American style of art.\n\nThese programs employed some of the 20th century’s most celebrated [artists](https://mymodernmet.com/wpa-federal-art-project/), including Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Lee Krasner, and Mark Rothko, and yielded over 100,000 works, including murals, sculptures, and paintings. The Federal Art Project aimed to be inclusive of artists of varying experience levels and allowed wide latitude in subject matters and styles, with program director Holger Cahill declaring, “Anything painted by an American artist is American art.”\n\nBeyond providing relief to unemployed artists, the programs were designed to “ameliorate growing discontent and inspire civic feeling” ([source](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo19909836.html)). Importantly, they shifted the perception of art from a luxury good financed through private patronage to an essential part of what constituted a democracy. Art became accessible to all and woven into the fabric of public spaces, versus limited to rarefied circles. The role of the artist became validated as an essential part of the economy and community, as opposed to a frivolous hobbyist.\n\n\n![“The Bauxite Mines” by Julius Woeltz for the Benton, AR post office](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a66d888e-6bfd-46ef-9999-bf7bc45f2851.jpeg?height=394&width=800)\n\n\nNearly a century later, it’s time to renew that spirit. The present day mirrors the 1930s New Deal-era in many ways, with widespread job loss, a broad sense of burnout, and a need to bridge divides across communities. Importantly, COVID-19 has exacerbated income inequality to levels not seen since the Gilded Age—the top 1% of Americans now hold [30.4%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2020/10/08/top-1-of-us-households-hold-15-times-more-wealth-than-bottom-50-combined/?sh=651adbd55179) of all household wealth—with low-income workers, women, and minority groups disproportionately suffering job loss and health risks. After this economic collapse, as after the Great Depression, we ought to explore ways to support recovery, especially for the most vulnerable groups.\n\n## **Universal Creative Income (UCI)**\n\nToday, the financial precarity associated with creative professions means that those who pursue art are typically well off: someone whose family has an income of $100,000 is [twice as likely](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/wealth-strong-predictor-whether-individual-pursues-creative-profession-180972072/) to become an artist, actor, musician, or author than someone from a family with $50,000 income. And those from households with an annual income of $1 million are *10 times* more likely to become artists than those from families with a $100,000 income. *Money*’s Kristen Bahler [wrote](https://money.com/rich-people-get-more-creative-jobs/), “Devoting yourself to the life of a ‘starving artist’ is a lot less risky if your family has enough money to make sure you don’t actually starve.” This uneven opportunity landscape remains true in the world of online content creation: a 2013 [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcc4.12042) in the *Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication* found that “online content creators tend to be from relatively privileged groups and the content of online services based on their contributions may be biased towards what is most interesting or relevant to them.”\n\nDespite the democratization of creative tools and platforms and the lower barriers to becoming a creator on the internet, financial success is concentrated among just a small segment of top creators, and the [middle class](https://li.substack.com/p/building-the-middle-class-of-the) of the creator economy remains elusive.\n\n## **Platform-provided UCI**\n\nIn some ways, creative works on the internet resemble public goods: they are nonexcludable (a user cannot exclude others from consuming the good) and nonrivalrous (one’s usage of the good does not prevent others from consuming it). When creators post a video on TikTok or write a tweetstorm, the entire world can consume and benefit from them. The content can provide entertainment, connection, and edification, spark new insights, and have positive externalities. Consumers value the content, but it’s infeasible to charge for it—unless the creator puts up a paywall and turns the public good into a club good.\n\n![Source: https://boycewire.com/public-goods-definition-and-examples/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/076c7d81-3e90-491d-8849-1d386947d5e6.jpeg?height=350&width=600)\n\n\n\nGovernment spending is one way to provide public goods, but not the only way. In line with the notion of the [net state](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/news/qa-alexis-wichowski-discusses-growing-power-%E2%80%9Cnet-states%E2%80%9D)—in which our economic and cultural lives are increasingly shaped by tech companies that rival nation-states in their power and capital—technology platforms are another potential source of funding for these creative workers.\n\nTech companies commonly compare themselves to digital public spaces: Mark Zuckerberg [wrote](https://www.facebook.com/notes/2420600258234172/) in 2019 that Facebook and Instagram were “the digital equivalent of a town square,” and Jack Dorsey has referred to Twitter as a “[digital public square](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1037399093084151808).” In the physical world, public spaces are typically funded through a combination of local, state, and federal funding; for tech platforms, funding emerging creators can be a form of investing and supporting those who contribute to the vitality of digital town squares.\n\n**In the digital world, user rights are civic rights, and creator rights are worker rights.** Today, creator-workers have little voice over their compensation, protections, and labor practices. Platform-sponsored basic income for creators would be one step towards facilitating a more worker-friendly environment. In turn, a richer and more diverse content environment would enhance the consumer experience.\n\nI introduced the idea of a platform-sponsored Universal Creative Income (UCI) in my December essay about the need to support a [creator middle class](https://li.substack.com/p/building-the-middle-class-of-the), outlining platform UCI as a possible solution to support emerging creators.\n\n> Providing creators with a basic income may be a wise strategy to incentivize more creators to devote more time to content creation. TikTok’s Creator Fund announcement echoes this sentiment: “The U.S. fund will start with $200 million to help support ambitious creators who are seeking opportunities to foster a livelihood through their innovative content.”\n\nGuaranteed income would enable individuals to spend more time on creative pursuits, rather than worrying about being able to meet basic needs. Successful implementation of UCI would bring improvements in creator stress and mental health, and create a more equitable path for a more diverse array of creators to be able to pursue content creation as a career.\n\nFor platforms, the idea is simple: **use company revenue to fund a Universal Creative Income program for emerging creators on the platform**. For instance, companies like Facebook or YouTube could carve out a fund to support creators on the platform and send them a monthly check to cover basic living expenses, regardless of skill, training, or background. UCI differs from most prevailing platform creator funds in terms of consistency of payments, transparency of eligibility criteria, and focus on smaller emerging creators. To the last point: we believe focusing on creators who are in the greatest financial need would create the largest impact on participation in the creator economy.\n\n### **Platform benefits of UCI**\n\nWhile UCI may appear to be predicated on altruism on the part of companies, there are tangible business benefits that could make such a program a worthwhile investment. UCI can better align creator and platform incentives, and drive downstream user engagement and retention.\n\n**1. Compete for creators**. Implementing a UCI program allows platforms to attract creators in an era in which every social platform is fiercely competing for creator attention. There has been a steady drumbeat of new creator funding initiatives, signifiers of the battle to win over creators. The [TikTok Creator Fund](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-the-200-million-tiktok-creator-fund) was announced in summer 2020, committing to award $1 billion to creators in the US in the next 3 years, and [Snap Spotlight](https://investor.snap.com/news/news-details/2020/Snap-Inc.-Launches-Spotlight-a-New-Entertainment-Platform-for-User-Generated-Content-within-Snapchat/default.aspx)—which pays out $1 million daily—followed suit just months later. While these programs are a step in the right direction for compensating creators, the distribution of funds is correlated with success, making them financially meaningful only to the superstars on each platform. A UCI program can be beneficial in attracting and retaining a much larger population of creators.\n\n**2. Empower more diverse creators to participate in the creator economy**. Just as unpaid internships [exclude](https://www.epi.org/blog/unpaid-internships-economic-mobility/) students from lower-income backgrounds who cannot afford to work for free, the current paradigm in the creator economy of amassing an audience through free content before eventually monetizing locks out creators who are less able to take financial risks.\n\n**Our hypothesis is that funding the long-tail of creators can create more long-term business impact than funding top creators who can already monetize in myriad ways and are highly sought after by many platforms.** A UCI program targeted at emerging creators can engender more creator loyalty and build a proprietary acquisition channel for the next generation of talent. A recent example of a platform initiative targeting emerging creators is Pinterest’s newly-announced [Creator Fund](https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/creatorcode), which is explicitly focused on underrepresented communities who acutely need financial and creative resources: “we saw a need to uplift Creators and communities that have been disproportionately underrepresented on the platform.”\n\nAlexis Wichowski in *[The Information Trade](https://www.amazon.com/Information-Trade-Countries-Challenges-Transforms/dp/0062888986) writes*, “The digital realm needs to stay ‘healthy’ in order to keep users there. It’s in net states’ best interests to invest in the health of that ecosystem.” UCI can foster a healthier ecosystem by financially assisting emerging creators—ultimately leading to more user engagement and a richer content ecosystem on the platform.\n\n**3. Retain creators throughout their entire lifecycles**. For creators, an early decision they make is choosing a platform to begin creating content on. A UCI program could tip the scales in favor of a platform, encouraging creators to begin their content creation on that ecosystem. From there, it’s easier to retain creators as they grow and progress in their lifecycles. For creators who develop familiarity with product features and build a following on the platform, there’s added lock-in that translates into increased retention.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b01c71bb-483c-483b-8ffd-3447c14be691.png?height=405&width=720)\n\n\n**4. Counteract resentment among smaller creators**. From our conversations with emerging creators, there’s often a sense that platforms prioritize top creators, granting them preferential treatment, lower take rates, and greater visibility and promotion. A platform-sponsored UCI would counteract that perception, demonstrating to emerging creators that they are a valued part of the ecosystem.\n\nIn short, UCI functions like any business investment: the benefits of a UCI program, in the form of acquiring more creators and fostering a more vibrant ecosystem of content, should exceed the cost of implementing such a program.\n\n### **Creator benefits for UCI**\n\n**1. Encourage experimentation and creativity**. Research on the interplay between creativity and social vs. financial rewards has [found](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/44/3/536/3738819) that social recognition—which drives much of the online creator economy—induces conformity, whereas financial rewards boost originality. UCI could encourage creators to experiment and take on bigger risks with their content, tackling new and diverse topics without fear of alienating their audience or underperforming.\n\n**2. Improve creator wellness**. Hunter Walk recently [wrote](https://hunterwalk.medium.com/instagram-youtube-tiktok-are-burning-out-their-creators-heres-how-to-fix-that-7298dcfbd055) that \"being a modern creator is, for many, exhausting,\" since social media platforms reward content velocity. UCI can encourage more balance and ward off creator burnout. A 1970s [universal basic income (UBI) experiment](https://www.chatelaine.com/news/universal-basic-income-canada-faq/) gave a group of Manitoba, Canada residents a guaranteed income for a five-year period; as a result, women took more time off for maternity leave and more students completed high school. By removing concerns over meeting basic needs, UCI can similarly afford creators the ability to make decisions that optimize for long-term benefits.\n\n**3. Bridge the gap from side hustle to main hustle**. A familiar milestone for any employee-turned-creator is the anxiety surrounding the initial plunge into creating full-time—and the associated initial pay cut. UCI can help more creators make the transition from side hustle to main hustle by smoothing income as creators navigate finding [creator-market fit](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1376393732610785283).\n\nThe net impact of UCI would be more content creators—including those who otherwise would not have taken the risk to become creators—and a higher-quality, more diverse content ecosystem. Substack echoed these benefits in their blog post explaining the [Substack Pro program](https://blog.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers), their advance payments program for writers:\n\n> We like this structure because, while some who get these deals are already well off, it gives financially constrained writers the ability to start building a sustainable enterprise. We take most of the risk for them. In return, their work contributes to the quality of the Substack ecosystem and they become long-term customers.\n\n### **What are the risks of platform UCI?**\n\nHaving tech platforms sponsor UCI programs is not without risk. It moves us from the real-world paradigm in which governments and central banks have absolute power over money, to an online world in which platforms have greater control over the livelihoods of emerging artists.\n\nFor creators in the UCI program, being a beneficiary increases dependency on a single company that maintains power to make unilateral decisions about payment amounts, program eligibility, etc. Unlike a government-sponsored UBI, there’s no democratic process to get the consent of the stakeholders in the design of platform UCI.\n\nAnother major potential downside is stifling innovation. While established, profitable companies are able to fund UCI, it’s infeasible for early-stage startups to do the same. Startups would be less financially attractive to emerging creators, who may increasingly opt to create on platforms that offer UCI. Just as the New Deal was part of a cultural agenda to Americanize art and create a sense of shared national identity, platform-sponsored UCI could similarly “platformize” art, making certain formats more widely accepted and valued and entrenching platforms’ lock-in.\n\nA platform-funded UCI program could also be controversial among top creators, because it is effectively redistribution within the platform’s economy: a share of the platform’s revenue—which is disproportionately earned from the top creators—would be allocated to emerging creators. In the real world, the political resistance to UBI stems, in part, from the increase in taxes necessary to fund it. Residents already take into consideration taxation in deciding [where to live](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2020/09/24/bay-area-wealthy-moving-with-urgency-ahead-of-expe.html). The parallel in the creator economy is that top creators can move elsewhere—taking their audiences with them—in order to avoid platform take rates that go toward subsidizing UCI.\n\nIt’s worth noting, however, that platform-sponsored UCI could promote a net increase in the accessibility of being an online creator as a career. And to-date, a lack of monetization features has not hindered new startups (e.g. Clubhouse for the first year) from attracting creators.\n\n### **How to implement platform UCI**\n\n1. Platform calculates a share of its revenue that it can allocate to a UCI program, as well as decides on the segment of creators it would like to target and criteria for determining eligibility. The criteria would be determined based on business goals, for instance, targeting creators for whom regular cash payments would have the greatest marginal utility and generate the most incremental new creation activity. This eligibility criteria would also serve to distinguish aspiring, emerging creators from regular consumer users.\n2. Once a creator hits the eligibility criteria, they can elect to begin receiving UCI payments. The company sends creators a monthly check for a standard amount for UCI.\n3. At the end of 12 months (or a predetermined length of time), the creator is phased out of UCI. The time-bound nature of the program is intentional, so that every emerging creator gets a shot, but limits the scope of the program so that platforms don’t have to subsidize every long-tail creator forever.\n4. Platform assesses the UCI program’s results against business objectives (e.g. original content creation, engagement, retention) and iterates from there.\n\n## **Crypto UCI**\n\nAs an alternative to platform-funded UCI, crypto could also be used to implement more transparent and democratic forms of artist funding. In a [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=165EfOwRVkw) conversation, Collab.Land founder James Young describes a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that could sell fractionalized NFTs and use the proceeds to fund grants for emerging artists, who would, in turn, give the organization a portion of their social tokens as a form of collateral.\n\nAnother implementation could be that a community treasury could use a portion of its holdings to fund a UCI program. It would function similarly to the platform UCI outlined above, but rather than a centralized company making unilateral decisions about UCI, users and creators of the DAO would participate in governance decisions, including the mechanics of the basic income program for creators.\n\nThe downsides of using crypto to fund artists are greater complexity and new behavior changes: creators would need to have crypto wallets and learn how to transfer cryptocurrencies into fiat (to buy materials, pay for food, rent, etc.). If UCI is targeted at the lowest income creators, it’s a segment that is less likely to be familiar with the mechanics underlying a crypto UCI program and requires more onboarding and education.\n\nReturning to the New Deal, crypto UCI has the potential to renew the democratic spirit of the Federal Art Project. Just as the Federal Art Project employed artists whose work was [installed](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/new-deal-federal-art-project-support-arts-coronavirus-1202684330/) in public spaces like schools, hospitals, and libraries, new crypto business models like NFTs and crowdfunds can enable creators to monetize while still preserving public access to their work. An ARTnews column [contrasts](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/new-deal-federal-art-project-support-arts-coronavirus-1202684330/), \"If the commercialization of art was accompanied by its dislocation in galleries, museums, and private homes [...] then the FAP sought a more inclusive understanding and appreciation of culture by endeavoring to integrate art with everyday experience.” Crypto UCI can combat the dislocation of content, moving it from walled gardens to more open ecosystems where creators have more control over their businesses and consumers can have more access to information.\n\nThough platform-funded UCI and crypto UCI may appear ideologically opposed, they are not mutually exclusive. Web2 and Web3 solutions can and will live in tandem: crypto UCI can be a great funding mechanism for creators with community recognition, but for a brand new creator, the distribution potential of Web2 aggregators is currently unparalleled.\n\n## **From UCI to UBI**\n\nBeyond just funding creators, there could be benefits for expanding basic income to a wider swath of the population. **Universal Basic Income (UBI) can be a hidden form of creator funding, freeing more people to be more creative and innovative**. Research shows that children from high-income (top 1%) families are [ten times as likely](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24062) to become inventors as those from below-median income families; moreover, downstream product innovation also disproportionately [benefits](https://scholar.harvard.edu/xavier/paper-1) higher-income households.\n\nIn the 2020 election, presidential candidate Andrew Yang called for giving every American adult a basic income of $1,000 every month, with one of the stated benefits being to enable people to “[be more creative](https://2020.yang2020.com/policies/the-freedom-dividend/).” Today, support for UBI is especially popular among young people: adults under age 30 favor the government providing a UBI by roughly [two-to-one](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/19/more-americans-oppose-than-favor-the-government-providing-a-universal-basic-income-for-all-adult-citizens/). Despite this recent popularization of UBI, the idea of a guaranteed income has a long-standing history: [Napoleon](https://www.investopedia.com/news/history-of-universal-basic-income/), [Thomas Paine](https://basicincometoday.com/thomas-paines-centuries-old-argument-for-ubi-as-a-right/), and [Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/08/martin-luther-kings-economic-dream-a-guaranteed-income-for-all-americans/279147/) all expressed support for some form of cash handout or base compensation.\n\nDespite the benefits of UBI, the US may not have the political will to enact such a program anytime soon. UBI Research is a think tank that explores possible implementations of *government-independent* UBI; many of its compiled [projects](https://ubiresearch.org/projects) are crypto-based. For instance, [UBI](https://blog.kleros.io/introducing-ubi-universal-basic-income-for-humans/) is a crypto project that continuously [streams](https://twitter.com/scottsantens/status/1377334493640499203?s=20) $UBI tokens to successfully verified members, who have been registered as unique humans on [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/), a social identity system for humans on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n## **The future of digital creative life**\n\nBeyond providing employment for artists, the New Deal had a larger mission: to promote what Franklin D. Roosevelt called \"a more abundant life.\" New Deal cultural programs enabled countless Americans to see original artwork for the first time, attend their first live theater show, and attend educational programming at community centers around the country.\n\nToday, social media platforms likewise enable consumers to access a multitude of creative work at no expense to themselves, but the advertising model and digital nature of content have undermined the economic viability of content creation online. The end result is that the creator economy resembles an economy of superstars, and the vast majority of creators are struggling to make ends meet—and all creators are building on a shaky foundation as their ability to reach audiences and earn income is dictated by a small handful of companies.\n\nThough crypto holds promise for platforms to be more open and transparent and for users to directly own and participate in the upside of the underlying platform, there’s already a power-law distribution emerging for creators. On NFT marketplaces, the top 1% of artists account for [48% of sales](https://justincone.com/posts/nft-skeptics-guide/). It’s a power law dynamic that mirrors the traditional art world, in which the top 1% of artists account for [64% of auction sales](https://d2u3kfwd92fzu7.cloudfront.net/Art%20Basel%20and%20UBS_The%20Art%20Market_2018.pdf).\n\nWith pandemic-induced job insecurity and heightening income inequality, it is more pressing than ever to enact programs that create broader on-ramps for creator success. **As we spend more of our lives in digital town squares, it’s important to foster a healthier ecosystem in these online cities, with stronger civic activity, democratic decision-making, funding for public works, and an economy with a robust creator middle class.** Universal Creative Income can be a step in this direction.\n\n---\n\n*We hope that the ideas and solutions outlined in this essay are considered starting points in a longer conversation.
