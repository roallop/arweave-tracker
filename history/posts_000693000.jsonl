Instructions about both can be found later in this post.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6391a341-d325-447b-9f6c-f240928c8dcc.png?height=500&width=704)\n\n## What's Impossible Object?\n\nImpossible Object's books will exist at the intersection of crypto and legacy publishing. This means we'll be publishing innovative books the old-fashioned way, as trade paperbacks and eBooks, but we're also attempting something completely new: simultaneously releasing on the blockchain so that we can use crypto's capacities to help make new kinds of book.\n\n*Conversations on AI* will be the first result of this experiment. Crypto has already provided solutions for crowdfunding [fiction](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), [science](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/41443491289334730858714141368268395642829177615924976808738423867555824271361) and [music](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM); now it's philosophy's turn. Backers of $IMPOSSIBLE will see the first ever philosophy book funded by crypto brought into the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3d1d3f6a-456e-48cd-8b79-5d1140227771.jpg?height=2728&width=2728)\n\n## Who's taking part in the conversations – and why are they about AI?\n\nThe initial impetus for the project was to assemble a group of pioneering thinkers so they could discuss a topic that all of their work has a stake in, and publish their discussions as a public good.\n\nThat group ended up comprising Reza Negarestani, Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester and Nick Srnicek. And the topic that turned out to unite their interests was Artificial Intelligence. \n\nThese thinkers have previously dealt with AI from various angles: some have written about AI directly (Reza Negarestani's *Intelligence and Spirit* and Nick Srnicek's work on the political economy of AI), some engage with AI as a collaborator (Holly Herndon, Mat Dryhurst and SPAWN), while some have developed the notion of artificiality in itself as a means out of conceptual deadlock (Helen Hester and Benjamin Bratton).\n\nIn the three conversations on the topic, AI will act more as a crossroads than the sole focus. Our dialogists are fascinated by the impact that AI will have on politics, art, philosophy, education, terraforming, and many more things, meaning that although the dialogues may consistently pass through AI, they will almost certainly end up at surprising destinations.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3650eb7b-b2d7-405a-833e-e96ab8ae0adc.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Reza Negarestani** is a philosopher and a former systems engineer. Since the early 2000s, he has contributed extensively to journals and anthologies, and lectured at numerous international universities and institutes including Duke University, MIT, École Normale Supérieure, and Haus der Kulturen der Welt among others. Negarestani’s writings have been translated to twelve languages. Negarestani’s latest philosophical work is *Intelligence and Spirit*(Urbanomic/Sequence Press/MIT, 2018), a book investigating the meaning of intelligence at the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, theory of computation and the philosophy of German Idealism.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/36c1d3cb-b3d1-4273-85f4-ece4dbedcd0c.png?height=700&width=500)\n\n**Benjamin Bratton's** work spans Philosophy, Art, Design and Computer Science. He is Professor of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego. He is Program Director of The Terraforming programme at Strelka Institute of Media, Architecture and Design in Moscow. He is also a Visiting Professor at The European Graduate School,  SCI_Arc (The Southern California Institute of Architecture) and NYU Shanghai. He is the author of several books including *The Revenge of The Real: Politics for a Post-Pandemic World *(Verso, 2021) and *The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty*  (MIT Press, 2015).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5cb5a2e-846b-429c-b790-33688ae2084f.png?height=400&width=650)\n\n**Mathew Dryhurst** is an artist and researcher based in Berlin, Germany. His research focuses on technical and ethical protocols. He makes music and creates art with Holly Herndon, and their albums *Proto* and *Platform* (4AD) have provoked international critical acclaim. He teaches at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, Strelka Institute and European Graduate School. He previously served as Director of Programming at Gray Area in San Francisco.\n\n**Holly Herndon** is an American composer, musician, and sound artist based in Berlin, Germany. After studying composition at Stanford University and completing her Ph.D. at Stanford University’s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics, she pursued a music career internationally. Herndon's music often includes human singing voices (including her own), is primarily computer-based, and regularly uses the visual programming language Max/MSP to create custom instruments and vocal processes.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/88dd94d0-5b76-49ba-9357-cb56c286038b.png?height=500&width=1000)\n\n**Helen Hester** is Professor of Gender, Technology and Work at the University of West London. Her research interests include technology, social reproduction, and the future of work, and she is a member of the international feminist working group Laboria Cuboniks. Her books include *Beyond Explicit: Pornography and the Displacement of Sex* (SUNY Press, 2014), *Xenofeminism* (Polity, 2018), and *After Work: The Politics of Free Time* (Verso, 2022, with Nick Srnicek).\n\n**Nick Srnicek** is a Lecturer in Digital Economy at King's College London. He is the author of *Platform Capitalism* (Polity, 2016), *Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work* (Verso, 2015 with Alex Williams).\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a9e8862-0cd7-4c28-a3d4-4a6e5ec3564a.png?height=511&width=664)\n\n\n\n## What's $IMPOSSIBLE?\n\n$IMPOSSIBLE is the token that backers of the crowdfund will receive in return for their contributions of ether. \n\nIf you're already familiar with Mirror crowdfunds and how they differ from regular crowdfunds, that won't need any explanation. But if you're new here, here's a lil explainer:\n\n- Holding $IMPOSSIBLE tokens not only proves you helped make the book happen in the first place, but also gives you a stake in the financial success of the book.\n- Once the book is completed, the text will be minted as an NFT on Zora and put up for a reserve auction.\n\n- When the NFT sells, the smart contract funnels funds back to $IMPOSSIBLE holders in proportion to the amount of $IMPOSSIBLE they hold.\n\n-  At that point, backers can choose to sell their $IMPOSSIBLE tokens on an exchange such as Uniswap, redeeming them for ether, or carry on holding them. Holders will receive financial upside whenever the NFT is auctioned again in the future.\n\n- $IMPOSSIBLE holders will be able to play a governance role by taking part in Snapshot polls relating to *Conversations on AI*.\n\n- That's not all. Hold on for a full explanation of additional benefits below.\n\n[Diagram of how it works?]\n\n## When will the conversations happen?\n\nAs soon as the crowdfund is over. \n\nAfter that, the publication of the book will occur in two stages.\n\n### Stage 1\n\nOnce the conversations have all taken place, they'll be published on Mirror as an eBook of approximately 50000 words – equivalent to about 200 printed pages. This will be free for all to read.\n\n### Stage 2\n\nThis is where things really start to get interesting. \n\nBefore the trade paperback is published, Impossible Object will seek responses to the dialogues from their first readership. The call for proposed responses will be open to **all** readers, not just holders of $IMPOSSIBLE. One to three of these will be published alongside the main dialogues in the first full print and electronic edition of the book. \n\nAlso, the names of the original backers and holders of the $IMPOSSIBLE token will be included the acknowledgements and logged forever on the blockchain in recognition of the role they played in making the book happen.\n\nPrinting commentaries and objections alongside the main text has a long tradition, stretching back before Descartes' *Meditations*. But with Mirror's help we're giving things a web3 twist.\n\n\n\n![Still from Metahaven's \"The Sprawl\"](https://thefader-res.cloudinary.com/private_images/w_1800,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:best/screen_shot_2016-04-20_at_21.52.37_rqwpvi/screenshot-from-i-the-sprawl-i.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Who will design the book?\nWe're excited to say that editorial design for the book and for Impossible Object's future titles will be by the incredible Metahaven.\n\nNot only will Metahaven be doing editorial design for *Conversations on AI*; in line with a plan that will be repeated with future Impossible Object titles, the front cover image will be minted as a standalone NFT and auctioned a little further down the line. \n\nSome of the proceeds of this will go to iODAO, Impossible Object's creator DAO.\n\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1464387a-458e-4d20-b694-34e576c840a0.png?height=409&width=430)\n\n\n\n## How much are you aiming to raise?\n\nWe're aiming to raise up to 25 ether. This will go to:\n\n- Our dialogists: Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester, Reza Negarestani and Nick Srnicek\n- Our designer, Metahaven\n- The costs of producing, marketing and distributing the book\n- The development of web3 functionality on Impossible Object's website and forthcoming Discord server, giving $IMPOSSIBLE holders access to the benefits that this entails.\n\n## What are the different tiers of backer rewards?\n\n**Every backer**\n- $IMPOSSIBLE tokens at the rate: 1 ether = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE\n- Proportional stakes in the sale of the book's NFT as described above.\n- Proportional voting power in polls relating to the book.\n- Mention in the book's acknowledgements.\n\n**0.25 ether and above**\n- The above, plus...\n- A copy of the trade paperback\n- Invitation to a 2hr Zoom roundtable on AI, led by Reza Negarestani and featuring participants in the book.\n\n**0.75 ether and above**\n- The above, plus...\n- A signed copy of the book.\n- A one-on-one call with Reza Negarestani about anything at all (not necessarily AI!).\n\n", "timestamp": 1621855050, "digest": "hqkBkj6ttSQfHvgdArGYPNgw9JkrlLAyZqC5UWqk3s0", "contributor": "0xc46E9a66FDdC8D1a69529d86E668236f02957F1b"}

Tetherの準備金に対する不安感\n5.  タックスデー（5月17日は、米国の税金申告期限）\n\nまたその他の要因としてインフレ警告や、米国政府と中央銀行が最近決定した財政・金融政策（景気刺激策、赤字支出、低金利）などのマクロ経済的要因により、広い範囲で市場が不安定になっている点も触れています。\n　\n　\n５．[DeFi Dashboard Zapper Raises $15M to Build On-Platform App Store](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-dashboard-zapper-raises-15m-to-build-on-platform-app-store)\n\nDeFiのダッシュボードを提供している[Zapper](https://zapper.fi/)は、シリーズAで$15Mドルを調達しました。Framework Venturesがリードで俳優のアシュトン・カッチャー氏のSound VenturesやMark Cubanが参加しています。\n\nZapperは、ウォレットを接続すると、簡単に残高を確認することができ、また複数のチェーンでスワップやステーキング、ファーミングを行うことができます。\n\nZapperによると、すでに月間15万人のアクティブユーザーを抱え、最近では累計出来高が$3Bドルを突破したそうです。今後開発者向けにプラットフォーム上のアプリストアを立ち上げる予定で、Zapperモバイルアプリの開発に取り組んでいます。\n\nマネタイズのモデルについてはまだ検討中のようで、Instadappsのようにトークンを発行する可能性もあると思いますが、ユーザと出来高も多いのでトークン無しでもいくらでもやりようがありそうです。\n　\n　\n６．[Surviving the Shark Tank](https://ardrive.io/surviving-the-shark-tank/)\n\n[ArDrive](https://ardrive.io/)が、$1.6Mドルを調達しました。Digital Renaissance Foundation、D1、SevenXや、Arweaveの創業チームが支援しました。\n\nArDriveは以前少し触れましたが、Dropboxなどの大手クラウドストレージに代わる、Arweaveチェーン上の分散型ストレージです。\n\nユーザは月単位ではなく、ファイル単位で課金になり、例えば20GBのストレージで既存の月額サービスと比べると以下のようになります。\n\n[![f:id:CoffeeTimes:20210523095800p:plain](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0df77122-5299-4b63-8d58-d0950b8e8550\\_1033x744.png

Mining）が行われていて、10月まで利用者に対してArDriveトークンが配られています。\n　\n　\n７．[Common Protocol Raises $3.2M to Streamline DeFi Governance](https://www.coindesk.com/commonwealth-labs-raises-3-2m-to-streamline-defi-governance)\n\nガバナンス関連のスタートアップ企業である[Common Protocol](https://commonwealth.im/)は、Dragonfly CapitalとParaFi Capitalがリードで、$3.2Mドルの資金調達を完了しました。Framework、Hashed、IDEO、Nascent、Balaji Srinivasanなども参加しています。Commonは、Polkadot上のチェーンを目指す[Edgeware](https://edgewa.re/)の開発元でもあります。\n\n今回リード投資家となったParaFiのSantiago Santosは、「DeFi全体のガバナンスに積極的に参加している私たちにとって、ポートフォリオ全体で増え続ける議論や提案を把握することは困難な場合がある」と述べています。\n\nそれに対応するのがCommonで、提案を監視・管理できるガバナンスのアグリゲータとも言えます。コンセプトはTallyと似ていますし、その他にも、Snapshot、Boardroomなどのガバナンスのツールがありますが、Commonは「EVM、Substrate、Cosmosに対応したプロトコルやトークンが使用できるマルチチェーンのプラットフォーム」を目指します。\n　\n　\n８．[Flux Protocol Raises $10.3M Seed Round to Build DeFi Infrastructure on NEAR](https://www.coindesk.com/flux-protocol-raises-10-3m-seed-round-to-build-defi-infrastructure-on-near)\n\nNEAR上の予測市場のプロトコル[Flux](https://www.fluxprotocol.org/)が$10.3Mを調達しました。Distributed Globalが主導し、Coinbase Ventures、CoinFund、Uncorrelated Ventures、Figment Capitalなどが参加しています。\n\nFluxは予測市場のためのオラクルのネットワークといえますが、バリデータが担保としてトークンをステークします。バリデータが報告するデータが正しければ、トークンはそのまま残り、さらに手数料を受け取ります。間違った報告には異議申し立てが入る可能性があり、そこで間違っていたバリデータはトークンを没収される可能性があります。こうすることで間違ったデータが入力されることを防ぎます。\n　\n　\n９．[Coinbase Wallet introduces new browser extension](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-wallet-introduces-new-browser-extension-dd067403b86?gi=91d17af197d4)\n\nCoinbase Walletは、MetaMaskと直接競合するChromeブラウザ・エクステンションの機能を新たに提供することを発表しました。\n\nこれまではモバイルアプリのみでしたが、今後はデスクトップのChromeユーザーが利用できるようになります。また既存のCoinbase Walletモバイルアカウントと直接同期するほか、Coinbaseのアカウントにリンクすることもでき、ユーザーはブラウザからクリプトを購入したり送金したりすることができます。\n\nMetaMaskはすでにデファクトになっていますが、一般層にはCoinbaseの認知度は高いため、競争になっていくと思います。\n　\n　\n１０．[DeFi Platform DeversiFi Raises $5M in Bid to Scale Trading on Ethereum](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-platform-deversifi-raises-5m-in-bid-to-scale-trading-on-ethereum)\n\nL2を利用したDEXの[DeversiFi](https://www.deversifi.com/)は、$5Mドルを調達しました。ParaFiがリードとなり、Defiance Capital、Lightspeed Venture Partners、Blockchain.com Ventures、Delphi Ventures、Fenbushi Capital、OKExなども参加しています。Aaveの創業者であるStani Kulechov氏や、連携しているStarkWareも参加しました。\n\nDVFトークンの供給の12.5%が、今回の投資家に渡されています。トークンの50％は、流動性マイニングまたは他のエアドロップなどでコミュニティに分配される予定です。今回の調達資金の一部は、レイヤー2のAMMプールのローンチや、流動性マイニングやツールの開発に充てられます。\n　\n　\n１１．[Coinbase Joins $5M Funding for Digital Transfer Agent Vertalo](https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-funding-vertalo)\n\nデジタル証券の発行と管理を支援する[Vertalo](https://www.vertalo.com/)は、Coinbaseなどから$5Mドルを調達しました。Tezos Foundation、Wedbush Capitalなどからの参加もあったとのことです。\n\n主にTezosとEthereumのブロックチェーンで、不動産や株式などの資産をセキュリティトークンの形でデジタル化することを支援しています。\n\n主要なサービスとしては、ブロックチェーンを使った資本政策表(キャップテーブル)を可能にし、株式や資産の所有者、金額、支払った価格、購入日などの関連情報とともにチェーン上に記録します。\n\nスマートコントラクトによって取引が決済されると、所有者の記録がリアルタイムで更新されます。スプレッドシート上で手動で更新されていた従来のキャップテーブルの管理を用意にしエラーを軽減することを目的としています。\n\nウェブサイトによると、Vertaloは米国証券取引委員会に名義書換代理人（トランスファー・エージェント）として登録しているため、発行者と共にして証券の所有権の記録を編集し、配当を分配し、取引を促進することができます。\n　\n　\n１２．[Cryptocurrencies.AI Raises $8M to Merge Decentralized and Centralized Trading](https://www.coindesk.com/cryptocurrencies-ai-raises-8m-to-merge-decentralized-and-centralized-trading)\n\n[Cryptocurrencies.AI](https://cryptocurrencies.ai/)は、Alameda Research、Alphabitなどの投資家を含む資金調達ラウンドで$8Mドルを調達しました。今回の資金調達ラウンドには、DFG、AU21、Master Ventures、Fomocraft Ventures、Protocol Ventures、A195、GBIC、Rarestone Capitalも参加しました。\n\n自動化や分析ツールを備えた取引所で、DEXはSolanaブロックチェーン上に構築されています。CEXもローンチ予定で、Binanceがブローカーパートナーになっています。\n　\n　\n１３．[DeFi lending platform Maple Finance debuts with its inaugural $17 million pool](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/105331/defi-lending-platform-maple-finance-first-17-million-pool)\n\nDeFiのレンディングプロトコルである[Maple Finance](https://www.maple.finance/)は、$17Mドルの最初のレンディングプールをローンチしました。最初の貸し手にはBlockchain.comとCoinSharesが、借り手にはAlameda Research、Wintermute、Amber Groupなどが名を連ねています。\n\n機関投資家向けDeFiということで、Maple については以前も少し書きましたが、貸し手となる資産プールの提供側の『Pool Delegate』が、借り手のプロフィールに基づいて金利、融資額、支払い条件を決定します。これによってMapleでは、借りる金額の100％以上を担保として出す必要がない点が特徴です。\n\n最初の『Pool Delegates』はトレード会社のOrthogonal Tradingで、$17Mドルのプールが作られています。借り手は、最大2Mドルの融資を受けることができます。金利は年率10～15％となっていて、担保のレベルは0〜50％の間で、信用力のある借り手は無担保で借りることができます。\n\nMapleのビジネスモデルですが、借り手が支払う手数料（ローン設立費用）の半分が、プロトコルの財源に回るようになっています。この手数料の残り半分は、プール代表者であるPool

{"id": "W66nyontu6_r3vsw8GQBFAFeONnaqQeE0ghivIOk4wY", "title": "Eth2.0最初のアップグレード「Altair」/ 投資DAO「Komorebi Collective」", "body": "■ Last Week in Crypto\n\n１．[What Eth 2.0 Validators Can Expect After the 'Altair' Upgrade](https://www.coindesk.com/eth-2-0-validators-can-expect-after-altair-upgrade)\n\nEth2.0の最初のアップグレード（コードネーム：Altair）が7月頃に実施される予定ですが、それによって何が変わるかが書かれた記事です。\n\nちなみにこの時期には、「ロンドン」と呼ばれる現行のEthereum1.0のハードフォークも予定されていますが、これについては以前書いたEIP1559がマージされます。\n\n#### **Altairで何が変わるか**\n\nAltairのアップグレードについては、上の記事と [Bison Trais の記事](https://bisontrails.co/eth2/012/)に概要がまとまっていますが、主にバリデータの責任が高まります。\n\n例えば活動を停止したバリデータのステークしているETHを失う量が多くなります。また、二重署名や二重提案などの悪い行為をしたバリデータは、ペナルティとして没収される金額が、0.25ETHから0.5ETHにあがります。\n\n最初にEth2.0が動き出したときに、参加を促すために意図的に下げられていましたが、元々の設定されていたものに近づけることが目的です。\n\n#### **報酬分配の是正**\n\nまた報酬の分配の不均衡が是正されます。現在バリデータ収益のうち、「正しいブロックへの投票」や「証明」に与えられる報酬が、収益の大半を占めていますが、Altairアップグレードで体系が少し変わります。具体的には、「次のブロックを提案する」ことの割合が、3%から約12.5%に上がり、役割による収益がより均等に分配されるようになります。\n\n#### **ライトクライアントのサポート準備**\n\nまた少ない計算量とデータ量で動作するEth 2.0ソフトウェア・クライアントのために必要な更新を行い、ライトクライアントをサポートする準備となります。\n\n#### **今後**\n\nこのAltairの次に控えるアップグレードでは、現行のEthereumとEth 2.0のチェーンをマージさせ、PoSに完全に移行させることが予定されています。なのでAltairはPoS完全移行への準備フェーズと言えます。\n　\n　\n２．[Fox Taps ‘Rick and Morty’ Creator Dan Harmon to Bring NFTs to TV](https://www.coindesk.com/fox-taps-rick-and-morty-creator-dan-harmon-to-bring-nfts-to-tv)\n\nテレビ番組「Rick and Morty」や「Community」の生みの親であるDan Harmon氏と、テレビ大手企業FoxがNFTに参入するようです。\n\nDan Harmon氏とFoxが「[Krapopolis](https://www.fox.com/krapopolis/)」というコメディアニメの番組を立ち上げていて、トークンを絡めたアニメになるそうです。プレスリリースには以下のように記載されていて、\n\n> 「KRAPOPOLISは、ブロックチェーン上で完全にキュレーションされた史上初のアニメーションシリーズとして機能します。『KRAPOPOLIS』専用のマーケットプレイスを立ち上げ、一点もののキャラクターや背景のアート、GIFなどのNFTから、スーパーファンを巻き込んで報酬を与える限定的なソーシャル体験を提供するトークンまで、デジタルグッズをキュレーションして販売していきます。」\n\n　\n　\n３．[Decentralized Komorebi Collective launches to back female and nonbinary crypto founders](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/decentralized-komorebi-collective-launches-to-back-female-and-non-binary-crypto-founders/?tpcc=ECTW2020)\n\nここ最近、多くのDAOが続々と誕生していますが、Komorebi Collective というDAOが発表されました。クリプト界隈の女性中心に設立された組織で、「女性またはノンバイナリージェンダーのクリプト創業者」に限定して投資を行うDAOになっています。\n\nクリプト非営利団体の [she256](http://she256.org/) や、[Women in Blockchain](https://blockchaingirls.org/)などから集められたコアチームメンバーが投資先を見つけてグループに提示するための大部分の作業を行います。その他のメンバーは、最低5,000ドルをコミットしたメンバーで、より軽い作業を行います。\n\nそして、それぞれの投資案件について、36名のメンバーの投票によって決定されます。メンバーには、Mechanism Capital、Dragonfly Capital、IDEO CoLab Venturesなどの企業に加え、Twitter、Coinbase、Skynet Labs、Celo Labs、Gitcoinなどの個人が含まれています。またこの組織は、[Syndicate Protocolを利用しています](https://www.syndicateprotocol.org/syndicate/komorebi_collective)。\n\nshe256いわく、少なくとも1人の女性創業者がいるチームは、7.24%の早さでexitできているそうです（[AllRaise](https://www.allraise.org/)参照）。また[First Round](https://firstround.com/)というVCの投資先では、女性の創業者がいる企業は、男性だけの創業チームの投資先に比べて、63％パフォーマンス良かったそうです。\n\nしかし、現在VCの90％は男性で、彼らは86％の資本を男性のみのチームに投資していて、昨年女性主導のスタートアップ企業が受けたVC出資は全体の2.3％だったそうです。\n\nそんな中でKomorebi Collectiveのようなコンセプトの投資DAOが出てくるのはとても良いことだと思いますし、暗号通貨やトークン、ブロックチェーンやDAOを使って、スタートアップ投資の敷居を下げていくのは意義のあることだと思います。\n　\n　\n#### **Delphi INFINFT**\n\nまた先週Syndicate上では、NFTや関連スタートアップへ投資をするDAO「[Delphi INFINFT](https://www.syndicateprotocol.org/syndicate/delphi_infinft)」が登場しました。\n\nDelphi Digitalと[gmoney](https://twitter.com/gmoneyNFT)氏（cryptopunkのNFTを140 ETHで購入して話題になった人物）が共同運営し、2021年に約20のNFTプロジェクトに約5Mドルを投資する予定になっています。ちなみにこのgmoney氏については [Bspeak!2021年1月8日号の8項](https://bspeak.substack.com/p/fei) もご参照ください。\n\nDelphi INFINFTには、IDEO CoLab Ventures、Gabby Dizon（Yield Guild）、Jiho（Axie Infinity）、Andrew Steinwold（Sfermion）、Andy（Fractional）、Calvin Liu（Compound）、Will Priceなどが支援しています。\n　\n　\n４．<https://www.paradigm.xyz/How_To_Survive_A_Crypto_Cycle.pdf>\n\n元Coinbase共同創業者で、Paradigm共同創業者のFred氏による「How To Survive a Crypto Cycle」（クリプトサイクルの生き残り方）です。\n\nCoinbaseで経験した過去3回のサイクル（2011, 2013, 2017）を元にしたアドバイスになっていますが、そこまで長くないレターなので、一読をオススメします。\n\nここに書かれているように、今後のサイクルは、ほぼ間違いなく過去の傾向は異なるものになるでしょうし、今サイクルにいるわけでもないかもしれませんが、過去を要素を理解することには価値があります。\n\nFredはサイクルの傾向として、\n\n*   非常に感情的である\n*   大規模な世間の注目を集める\n*   エコシステムが強化される\n*   弱い企業は淘汰される\n*   規制当局の注目を浴びる\n*   インフラが限界まで使われる\n\nという要素をあげ、それぞれに対して体験談を説明しています。そしてサイクルへの耐性を高めるために、効果的と感じたことが共有されています。\n\nいくつか視点はあると思いますが、ものすごく簡単にいえば、ロングタームで考えて、技術とそれによって実現する世界を見ていれば、サイクルへの耐性を持てるかと思います。特にロングタームで考えることの利点は大きいはずです。\n\nちなみに、先週価格がクラッシュした明確な理由はよく分かっていませんが、それについての[Decryptの記事](https://decrypt.co/71405/5-reasons-crypto-market-500-billion-bloodbath)では以下のように書かれて説明がされています。\n\n1.  中国が暗号通貨を禁止したという見出し\n2.  イーロン・マスク\n3.  レバレッジをかけたポジションの清算\n4.  Tetherの準備金に対する不安感\n5.  タックスデー（5月17日は、米国の税金申告期限）\n\nまたその他の要因としてインフレ警告や、米国政府と中央銀行が最近決定した財政・金融政策（景気刺激策、赤字支出、低金利）などのマクロ経済的要因により、広い範囲で市場が不安定になっている点も触れています。\n　\n　\n５．[DeFi Dashboard Zapper Raises $15M to Build On-Platform App Store](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-dashboard-zapper-raises-15m-to-build-on-platform-app-store)\n\nDeFiのダッシュボードを提供している[Zapper](https://zapper.fi/)は、シリーズAで$15Mドルを調達しました。Framework Venturesがリードで俳優のアシュトン・カッチャー氏のSound VenturesやMark Cubanが参加しています。\n\nZapperは、ウォレットを接続すると、簡単に残高を確認することができ、また複数のチェーンでスワップやステーキング、ファーミングを行うことができます。\n\nZapperによると、すでに月間15万人のアクティブユーザーを抱え、最近では累計出来高が$3Bドルを突破したそうです。今後開発者向けにプラットフォーム上のアプリストアを立ち上げる予定で、Zapperモバイルアプリの開発に取り組んでいます。\n\nマネタイズのモデルについてはまだ検討中のようで、Instadappsのようにトークンを発行する可能性もあると思いますが、ユーザと出来高も多いのでトークン無しでもいくらでもやりようがありそうです。\n　\n　\n６．[Surviving the Shark Tank](https://ardrive.io/surviving-the-shark-tank/)\n\n[ArDrive](https://ardrive.io/)が、$1.6Mドルを調達しました。Digital Renaissance Foundation、D1、SevenXや、Arweaveの創業チームが支援しました。\n\nArDriveは以前少し触れましたが、Dropboxなどの大手クラウドストレージに代わる、Arweaveチェーン上の分散型ストレージです。\n\nユーザは月単位ではなく、ファイル単位で課金になり、例えば20GBのストレージで既存の月額サービスと比べると以下のようになります。\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0df77122-5299-4b63-8d58-d0950b8e8550\\_1033x744.png

Mining）が行われていて、10月まで利用者に対してArDriveトークンが配られています。\n　\n　\n７．[Common Protocol Raises $3.2M to Streamline DeFi Governance](https://www.coindesk.com/commonwealth-labs-raises-3-2m-to-streamline-defi-governance)\n\nガバナンス関連のスタートアップ企業である[Common Protocol](https://commonwealth.im/)は、Dragonfly CapitalとParaFi Capitalがリードで、$3.2Mドルの資金調達を完了しました。Framework、Hashed、IDEO、Nascent、Balaji Srinivasanなども参加しています。Commonは、Polkadot上のチェーンを目指す[Edgeware](https://edgewa.re/)の開発元でもあります。\n\n今回リード投資家となったParaFiのSantiago Santosは、「DeFi全体のガバナンスに積極的に参加している私たちにとって、ポートフォリオ全体で増え続ける議論や提案を把握することは困難な場合がある」と述べています。\n\nそれに対応するのがCommonで、提案を監視・管理できるガバナンスのアグリゲータとも言えます。コンセプトはTallyと似ていますし、その他にも、Snapshot、Boardroomなどのガバナンスのツールがありますが、Commonは「EVM、Substrate、Cosmosに対応したプロトコルやトークンが使用できるマルチチェーンのプラットフォーム」を目指します。\n　\n　\n８．[Flux Protocol Raises $10.3M Seed Round to Build DeFi Infrastructure on NEAR](https://www.coindesk.com/flux-protocol-raises-10-3m-seed-round-to-build-defi-infrastructure-on-near)\n\nNEAR上の予測市場のプロトコル[Flux](https://www.fluxprotocol.org/)が$10.3Mを調達しました。Distributed Globalが主導し、Coinbase Ventures、CoinFund、Uncorrelated Ventures、Figment Capitalなどが参加しています。\n\nFluxは予測市場のためのオラクルのネットワークといえますが、バリデータが担保としてトークンをステークします。バリデータが報告するデータが正しければ、トークンはそのまま残り、さらに手数料を受け取ります。間違った報告には異議申し立てが入る可能性があり、そこで間違っていたバリデータはトークンを没収される可能性があります。こうすることで間違ったデータが入力されることを防ぎます。\n　\n　\n９．[Coinbase Wallet introduces new browser extension](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-wallet-introduces-new-browser-extension-dd067403b86?gi=91d17af197d4)\n\nCoinbase Walletは、MetaMaskと直接競合するChromeブラウザ・エクステンションの機能を新たに提供することを発表しました。\n\nこれまではモバイルアプリのみでしたが、今後はデスクトップのChromeユーザーが利用できるようになります。また既存のCoinbase Walletモバイルアカウントと直接同期するほか、Coinbaseのアカウントにリンクすることもでき、ユーザーはブラウザからクリプトを購入したり送金したりすることができます。\n\nMetaMaskはすでにデファクトになっていますが、一般層にはCoinbaseの認知度は高いため、競争になっていくと思います。\n　\n　\n１０．[DeFi Platform DeversiFi Raises $5M in Bid to Scale Trading on Ethereum](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-platform-deversifi-raises-5m-in-bid-to-scale-trading-on-ethereum)\n\nL2を利用したDEXの[DeversiFi](https://www.deversifi.com/)は、$5Mドルを調達しました。ParaFiがリードとなり、Defiance Capital、Lightspeed Venture Partners、Blockchain.com Ventures、Delphi Ventures、Fenbushi Capital、OKExなども参加しています。Aaveの創業者であるStani Kulechov氏や、連携しているStarkWareも参加しました。\n\nDVFトークンの供給の12.5%が、今回の投資家に渡されています。トークンの50％は、流動性マイニングまたは他のエアドロップなどでコミュニティに分配される予定です。今回の調達資金の一部は、レイヤー2のAMMプールのローンチや、流動性マイニングやツールの開発に充てられます。\n　\n　\n１１．[Coinbase Joins $5M Funding for Digital Transfer Agent Vertalo](https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-funding-vertalo)\n\nデジタル証券の発行と管理を支援する[Vertalo](https://www.vertalo.com/)は、Coinbaseなどから$5Mドルを調達しました。Tezos Foundation、Wedbush Capitalなどからの参加もあったとのことです。\n\n主にTezosとEthereumのブロックチェーンで、不動産や株式などの資産をセキュリティトークンの形でデジタル化することを支援しています。\n\n主要なサービスとしては、ブロックチェーンを使った資本政策表(キャップテーブル)を可能にし、株式や資産の所有者、金額、支払った価格、購入日などの関連情報とともにチェーン上に記録します。\n\nスマートコントラクトによって取引が決済されると、所有者の記録がリアルタイムで更新されます。スプレッドシート上で手動で更新されていた従来のキャップテーブルの管理を用意にしエラーを軽減することを目的としています。\n\nウェブサイトによると、Vertaloは米国証券取引委員会に名義書換代理人（トランスファー・エージェント）として登録しているため、発行者と共にして証券の所有権の記録を編集し、配当を分配し、取引を促進することができます。\n　\n　\n１２．[Cryptocurrencies.AI Raises $8M to Merge Decentralized and Centralized

Research、Alphabitなどの投資家を含む資金調達ラウンドで$8Mドルを調達しました。今回の資金調達ラウンドには、DFG、AU21、Master Ventures、Fomocraft Ventures、Protocol Ventures、A195、GBIC、Rarestone Capitalも参加しました。\n\n自動化や分析ツールを備えた取引所で、DEXはSolanaブロックチェーン上に構築されています。CEXもローンチ予定で、Binanceがブローカーパートナーになっています。\n　\n　\n１３．[DeFi lending platform Maple Finance debuts with its inaugural $17 million pool](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/105331/defi-lending-platform-maple-finance-first-17-million-pool)\n\nDeFiのレンディングプロトコルである[Maple Finance](https://www.maple.finance/)は、$17Mドルの最初のレンディングプールをローンチしました。最初の貸し手にはBlockchain.comとCoinSharesが、借り手にはAlameda Research、Wintermute、Amber Groupなどが名を連ねています。\n\n機関投資家向けDeFiということで、Maple については以前も少し書きましたが、貸し手となる資産プールの提供側の『Pool Delegate』が、借り手のプロフィールに基づいて金利、融資額、支払い条件を決定します。これによってMapleでは、借りる金額の100％以上を担保として出す必要がない点が特徴です。\n\n最初の『Pool Delegates』はトレード会社のOrthogonal Tradingで、$17Mドルのプールが作られています。借り手は、最大2Mドルの融資を受けることができます。金利は年率10～15％となっていて、担保のレベルは0〜50％の間で、信用力のある借り手は無担保で借りることができます。\n\nMapleのビジネスモデルですが、借り手が支払う手数料（ローン設立費用）の半分が、プロトコルの財源に回るようになっています。この手数料の残り半分は、プール代表者であるPool Delegateが得ます。またMapleのネイティブトークンであるMPLの保有者は、MPLトークンを出資したプールからの利回りの10分の1を得ることができます。\n \n

This means we'll be publishing innovative books the old-fashioned way, as trade paperbacks and eBooks. But we're also attempting something completely new: simultaneously releasing on the blockchain so that we can use crypto's capacities to help make new kinds of book.\n\n*Conversations on AI* will be the first result of this experiment. Crypto has already provided solutions for crowdfunding [fiction](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), [science](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/41443491289334730858714141368268395642829177615924976808738423867555824271361) and [music](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM); now it's philosophy's turn. Backers of $IMPOSSIBLE will see the first ever philosophy book funded by crypto brought into the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3d1d3f6a-456e-48cd-8b79-5d1140227771.jpg?height=2728&width=2728)\n\n## Who's taking part in the conversations – and why are they about AI?\n\nThe initial impetus for the project was to assemble a group of pioneering thinkers so they could discuss a topic that all of their work has a stake in, and publish their discussions as a public good.\n\nThat group ended up comprising Reza Negarestani, Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester and Nick Srnicek. And the topic that turned out to unite their interests was Artificial Intelligence. \n\nThese thinkers have previously dealt with AI from various angles: some have written about AI directly (Reza Negarestani's *Intelligence and Spirit* and Nick Srnicek's work on the political economy of AI), some engage with AI as a collaborator (Holly Herndon, Mat Dryhurst and SPAWN), while some have developed the notion of artificiality in itself as a means out of conceptual deadlock (Helen Hester and Benjamin Bratton).\n\nIn the three conversations on the topic, AI will act more as a crossroads than the sole focus. Our dialogists are fascinated by the impact that AI will have on politics, art, philosophy, education, terraforming, and many more things, meaning that although the dialogues may consistently pass through AI, they will almost certainly end up at surprising destinations.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3650eb7b-b2d7-405a-833e-e96ab8ae0adc.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Reza Negarestani** is a philosopher and a former systems engineer. Since the early 2000s, he has contributed extensively to journals and anthologies, and lectured at numerous international universities and institutes including Duke University, MIT, École Normale Supérieure, and Haus der Kulturen der Welt among others. Negarestani’s writings have been translated to twelve languages. Negarestani’s latest philosophical work is *Intelligence and Spirit*(Urbanomic/Sequence Press/MIT, 2018), a book investigating the meaning of intelligence at the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, theory of computation and the philosophy of German Idealism.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/36c1d3cb-b3d1-4273-85f4-ece4dbedcd0c.png?height=700&width=500)\n\n**Benjamin Bratton's** work spans Philosophy, Art, Design and Computer Science. He is Professor of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego. He is Program Director of The Terraforming programme at Strelka Institute of Media, Architecture and Design in Moscow. He is also a Visiting Professor at The European Graduate School,  SCI_Arc (The Southern California Institute of Architecture) and NYU Shanghai. He is the author of several books including *The Revenge of The Real: Politics for a Post-Pandemic World *(Verso, 2021) and *The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty*  (MIT Press, 2015).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5cb5a2e-846b-429c-b790-33688ae2084f.png?height=400&width=650)\n\n**Mathew Dryhurst** is an artist and researcher based in Berlin, Germany. His research focuses on technical and ethical protocols. He makes music and creates art with Holly Herndon, and their albums *Proto* and *Platform* (4AD) have provoked international critical acclaim. He teaches at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, Strelka Institute and European Graduate School. He previously served as Director of Programming at Gray Area in San Francisco.\n\n**Holly Herndon** is an American composer, musician, and sound artist based in Berlin, Germany. After studying composition at Stanford University and completing her Ph.D. at Stanford University’s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics, she pursued a music career internationally. Herndon's music often includes human singing voices (including her own), is primarily computer-based, and regularly uses the visual programming language Max/MSP to create custom instruments and vocal processes.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d282a589-ee4b-4fc1-8a3f-5591651e2b5b.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Helen Hester** is Professor of Gender, Technology and Work at the University of West London. Her research interests include technology, social reproduction, and the future of work, and she is a member of the international feminist working group Laboria Cuboniks. Her books include *Beyond Explicit: Pornography and the Displacement of Sex* (SUNY Press, 2014), *Xenofeminism* (Polity, 2018), and *After Work: The Politics of Free Time* (Verso, 2022, with Nick Srnicek).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e1948298-0307-4f62-a05f-4dc65252fcaf.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Nick Srnicek** is a Lecturer in Digital Economy at King's College London. He is the author of *Platform Capitalism* (Polity, 2016), *Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work* (Verso, 2015 with Alex Williams).\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a9e8862-0cd7-4c28-a3d4-4a6e5ec3564a.png?height=511&width=664)\n\n\n\n## What's $IMPOSSIBLE?\n\n$IMPOSSIBLE is the token that backers of the crowdfund will receive in return for their contributions of ether. \n\nIf you're already familiar with Mirror crowdfunds and how they differ from regular crowdfunds, that won't need any explanation. But if you're new here, here's a lil explainer:\n\n- Holding $IMPOSSIBLE tokens not only proves you helped make the book happen in the first place, but also gives you a stake in the financial success of the book.\n- Once the book is completed, the text will be minted as an NFT on Zora and put up for a reserve auction.\n\n- When the NFT sells, its smart contract funnels funds back to $IMPOSSIBLE holders in proportion to the amount of $IMPOSSIBLE they hold.\n\n-  At that point, backers can choose to sell their $IMPOSSIBLE tokens on an exchange such as Uniswap, redeeming them for ether, or carry on holding them. Holders will receive financial upside whenever the NFT is auctioned again in the future.\n\n- $IMPOSSIBLE holders will be able to play a governance role by taking part in Snapshot polls relating to *Conversations on AI*.\n\n- That's not all. Hold on for a full explanation of additional benefits below.\n\n[Diagram of how it works?]\n\n## When will the conversations happen?\n\nAs soon as the crowdfund is over. \n\nAfter that, the publication of the book will occur in two stages.\n\n### Stage 1\n\nOnce the conversations have all taken place, they'll be published on Mirror as an eBook of approximately 50000 words – equivalent to about 200 printed pages. This will be free for all to read.\n\n### Stage 2\n\nThis is where things really start to get interesting. \n\nBefore the trade paperback is published, Impossible Object will seek responses to the dialogues from their first readership. The call for proposed responses will be open to **all** readers, not just holders of $IMPOSSIBLE. One to three of these will be published alongside the main dialogues in the first full print and electronic edition of the book. \n\nAlso, the names of the original backers and holders of the $IMPOSSIBLE token will be included the acknowledgements and logged forever on the blockchain in recognition of the role they played in making the book happen.\n\nPrinting commentaries and objections alongside the main text has a long tradition, stretching back before Descartes' *Meditations*. But with Mirror's help we're giving things a web3 twist.\n\n\n\n![Still from Metahaven's \"The Sprawl\"](https://thefader-res.cloudinary.com/private_images/w_1800,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:best/screen_shot_2016-04-20_at_21.52.37_rqwpvi/screenshot-from-i-the-sprawl-i.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Who will design the book?\nWe're excited to say that editorial design for the book and for Impossible Object's future titles will be by the incredible **Metahaven**.\n\nThe work of Metahaven consists of filmmaking, writing, and design. Films by Metahaven include *The Sprawl (Propaganda about Propaganda)* (2015), *Information Skies* (2016, nominated for the 2017 European Film Awards), *Hometown* (2018), *Eurasia (Questions on Happiness)* (2018), and *Chaos Theory* (2021). Solo exhibitions include *Turnarounds*, e-flux, New York (2019), *Version History*, ICA London (2018), *Earth*, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (2018), *Hometown*, Izolyatsia, Kyiv (2018), *Information Skies*, Auto Italia, London (2016), *The Sprawl*, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco (2015), and *Islands in the Cloud*, MoMA PS1, New York (2013). Recent publications include PSYOP: An Anthology (Koenig Books, London, 2018), and Digital Tarkovsky (Strelka Press, Moscow, 2018). \n\nNot only will Metahaven be doing editorial design for *Conversations on AI*; in line with a plan that will be repeated with future Impossible Object titles, the front cover image will be minted as a standalone NFT and auctioned a little further down the line. \n\nSome of the proceeds of this will go to iODAO, Impossible Object's creator DAO.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1464387a-458e-4d20-b694-34e576c840a0.png?height=409&width=430)\n\n\n\n## How much are you aiming to raise?\n\nWe're aiming to raise up to 25 ether. This will go to:\n\n- Our dialogists: Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester, Reza Negarestani and Nick Srnicek\n- Our designer, Metahaven\n- The costs of producing, marketing and distributing the book\n- The development of web3 functionality on Impossible Object's website and forthcoming Discord server, giving $IMPOSSIBLE holders access to the benefits that this entails.\n\n## What are the different tiers of backer rewards?\n\n**Every backer**\n- $IMPOSSIBLE tokens at the rate: 1 ether = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE\n- Proportional stakes in the sale of the book's NFT as described above.\n- Proportional voting power in polls relating to the book.\n- Mention in the book's acknowledgements.\n\n**0.25 ether and above**\n- The above, plus...\n- A copy of the trade paperback\n- Invitation to a 2hr Zoom roundtable on AI, led by Reza Negarestani and featuring participants in the book.\n\n**0.75 ether and above**\n- The above, plus...\n- A signed copy of the book.\n- A one-on-one call with Reza Negarestani about anything at all (not necessarily AI!).\n\n", "timestamp": 1621861260, "digest": "hqkBkj6ttSQfHvgdArGYPNgw9JkrlLAyZqC5UWqk3s0", "contributor": "0xc46E9a66FDdC8D1a69529d86E668236f02957F1b"}

But if you're new here, here's a lil explainer:\n\n- Holding $IMPOSSIBLE tokens not only proves you helped make the book happen in the first place, but also gives you a stake in the financial success of the book.\n- Once the book is completed, the text will be minted as an NFT on Zora and put up for a reserve auction.\n\n- When the NFT sells, its smart contract funnels funds back to $IMPOSSIBLE holders in proportion to the amount of $IMPOSSIBLE they hold.\n\n-  At that point, backers can choose to sell their $IMPOSSIBLE tokens on an exchange such as Uniswap, redeeming them for ether, or carry on holding them. Holders will receive financial upside whenever the NFT is auctioned again in the future.\n\n- $IMPOSSIBLE holders will be able to play a governance role by taking part in Snapshot polls relating to *Conversations on AI*.\n\n- That's not all. Hold on for a full explanation of additional benefits below.\n\n[Diagram of how it works?]\n\n## When will the conversations happen?\n\nAs soon as the crowdfund is over. \n\nAfter that, the publication of the book will occur in two stages.\n\n### Stage 1\n\nOnce the conversations have all taken place, they'll be published on Mirror as an eBook of approximately 50000 words – equivalent to about 200 printed pages. This will be free for all to read.\n\n### Stage 2\n\nThis is where things really start to get interesting. \n\nBefore the trade paperback is published, Impossible Object will seek responses to the dialogues from their first readership. The call for proposed responses will be open to **all** readers, not just holders of $IMPOSSIBLE. One to three of these will be published alongside the main dialogues in the first full print and electronic edition of the book. \n\nAlso, the names of the original backers and holders of the $IMPOSSIBLE token will be included the acknowledgements and logged forever on the blockchain in recognition of the role they played in making the book happen.\n\nPrinting commentaries and objections alongside the main text has a long tradition, stretching back before Descartes' *Meditations*.

If you don’t have a wallet, Rainbow’s mobile app is a good option for iOS users. Alternatively, there's Metamask (iOS, Android and web).\n- 1 ether = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE. For example, someone contributing 0.5 ether will receive 500 $IMPOSSIBLE.\n- Ether transactions involve a transaction fee (Tx fee). The level of the Tx fee varies with the price of 'gas' on the network, which can be checked [here](https://ethgasstation.info/).

But we're also attempting something completely new: simultaneously releasing on the blockchain so that we can use crypto's capacities to help make new kinds of book.\n\n*Conversations on AI* will be the first result of this experiment. Crypto has already provided solutions for crowdfunding [fiction](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), [science](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/41443491289334730858714141368268395642829177615924976808738423867555824271361) and [music](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM); now it's philosophy's turn. Backers of $IMPOSSIBLE will see the first ever philosophy book funded by crypto brought into the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3d1d3f6a-456e-48cd-8b79-5d1140227771.jpg?height=2728&width=2728)\n\n## Who's taking part in the conversations – and why are they about AI?\n\nThe initial impetus for the project was to assemble a group of pioneering thinkers so they could discuss a topic that all of their work has a stake in, and publish their discussions as a public good.\n\nThat group ended up comprising **Reza Negarestani, Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester and Nick Srnicek**. And the topic that turned out to unite their interests was Artificial Intelligence. \n\nThese thinkers have previously dealt with AI from various angles: some have written about AI directly (Reza Negarestani's *Intelligence and Spirit* and Nick Srnicek's work on the political economy of AI), some engage with AI as a collaborator (Holly Herndon, Mat Dryhurst and SPAWN), while some have developed the notion of artificiality in itself as a means out of conceptual deadlock (Helen Hester and Benjamin Bratton).\n\nIn the three conversations on the topic, AI will act more as a crossroads than the sole focus. Our dialogists are fascinated by the impact that AI will have on politics, art, philosophy, education, terraforming, and many more things, meaning that although the dialogues may consistently pass through AI, they will almost certainly end up at surprising destinations.\n\nReza's short essay on the themes of *Conversations on AI* can be found [here](https://r.mirror.xyz/zghnOjS2aVlowlZ5D7ocnswHVSLSe04ZG-ubaMFBHmI).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3650eb7b-b2d7-405a-833e-e96ab8ae0adc.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Reza Negarestani** is a philosopher and a former systems engineer. Since the early 2000s, he has contributed extensively to journals and anthologies, and lectured at numerous international universities and institutes including Duke University, MIT, École Normale Supérieure, and Haus der Kulturen der Welt among others. Negarestani’s writings have been translated to twelve languages. Negarestani’s latest philosophical work is *Intelligence and Spirit*(Urbanomic/Sequence Press/MIT, 2018), a book investigating the meaning of intelligence at the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, theory of computation and the philosophy of German Idealism.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/36c1d3cb-b3d1-4273-85f4-ece4dbedcd0c.png?height=700&width=500)\n\n**Benjamin Bratton's** work spans Philosophy, Art, Design and Computer Science. He is Professor of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego. He is Program Director of The Terraforming programme at Strelka Institute of Media, Architecture and Design in Moscow. He is also a Visiting Professor at The European Graduate School,  SCI_Arc (The Southern California Institute of Architecture) and NYU Shanghai. He is the author of several books including *The Revenge of The Real: Politics for a Post-Pandemic World *(Verso, 2021) and *The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty*  (MIT Press, 2015).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5cb5a2e-846b-429c-b790-33688ae2084f.png?height=400&width=650)\n\n**Mathew Dryhurst** is an artist and researcher based in Berlin, Germany. His research focuses on technical and ethical protocols. He makes music and creates art with Holly Herndon, and their albums *Proto* and *Platform* (4AD) have provoked international critical acclaim. He teaches at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, Strelka Institute and European Graduate School. He previously served as Director of Programming at Gray Area in San Francisco.\n\n**Holly Herndon** is an American composer, musician, and sound artist based in Berlin, Germany. After studying composition at Stanford University and completing her Ph.D. at Stanford University’s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics, she pursued a music career internationally. Herndon's music often includes human singing voices (including her own), is primarily computer-based, and regularly uses the visual programming language Max/MSP to create custom instruments and vocal processes.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d282a589-ee4b-4fc1-8a3f-5591651e2b5b.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Helen Hester** is Professor of Gender, Technology and Work at the University of West London. Her research interests include technology, social reproduction, and the future of work, and she is a member of the international feminist working group Laboria Cuboniks. Her books include *Beyond Explicit: Pornography and the Displacement of Sex* (SUNY Press, 2014), *Xenofeminism* (Polity, 2018), and *After Work: The Politics of Free Time* (Verso, 2022, with Nick Srnicek).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/088cd853-c10f-45b6-a521-c961f6b87d21.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n\n**Nick Srnicek** is a Lecturer in Digital Economy at King's College London. He is the author of *Platform Capitalism* (Polity, 2016), *Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work* (Verso, 2015 with Alex Williams).\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a9e8862-0cd7-4c28-a3d4-4a6e5ec3564a.png?height=511&width=664)\n\n\n\n## What's $IMPOSSIBLE?\n\n$IMPOSSIBLE is the token that backers of the crowdfund will receive in return for their contributions of ether. \n\nIf you're already familiar with Mirror crowdfunds and how they differ from regular crowdfunds, that won't need any explanation. But if you're new here, here's a lil explainer:\n\n- Holding $IMPOSSIBLE tokens not only proves you helped make the book happen in the first place, but also gives you a stake in the financial success of the book.\n- Once the book is completed, the text will be minted as an NFT on Zora and put up for a reserve auction.\n\n- When the NFT sells, its smart contract funnels funds back to $IMPOSSIBLE holders in proportion to the amount of $IMPOSSIBLE they hold.\n\n-  At that point, backers can choose to sell their $IMPOSSIBLE tokens on an exchange such as Uniswap, redeeming them for ether, or carry on holding them. Holders will receive financial upside whenever the NFT is auctioned again in the future.\n\n- $IMPOSSIBLE holders will be able to play a governance role by taking part in Snapshot polls relating to *Conversations on AI*.\n\n- That's not all. Hold on for a full explanation of additional benefits below.\n\n[Diagram of how it works?]\n\n## When will the conversations happen?\n\nAs soon as the crowdfund is over. \n\nAfter that, the publication of the book will occur in two stages.\n\n### Stage 1\n\nOnce the conversations have all taken place, they'll be published on Mirror as an eBook of approximately 50000 words – equivalent to about 200 printed pages. This will be free for all to read.\n\n### Stage 2\n\nThis is where things really start to get interesting. \n\nBefore the trade paperback is published, Impossible Object will seek responses to the dialogues from their first readership. The call for proposed responses will be open to **all** readers, not just holders of $IMPOSSIBLE. One to three of these will be published alongside the main dialogues in the first full print and electronic edition of the book. \n\nAlso, the names of the original backers and holders of the $IMPOSSIBLE token will be included the acknowledgements and logged forever on the blockchain in recognition of the role they played in making the book happen.\n\nPrinting commentaries and objections alongside the main text has a long tradition, stretching back before Descartes' *Meditations*. But with Mirror's help we're giving things a web3 twist.\n\n\n\n![Still from Metahaven's \"The Sprawl\"](https://thefader-res.cloudinary.com/private_images/w_1800,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:best/screen_shot_2016-04-20_at_21.52.37_rqwpvi/screenshot-from-i-the-sprawl-i.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Who will design the book?\nWe're excited to say that editorial design for the book and for Impossible Object's future titles will be by the incredible **Metahaven**.\n\nThe work of Metahaven consists of filmmaking, writing, and design. Films by Metahaven include *The Sprawl (Propaganda about Propaganda)* (2015), *Information Skies* (2016, nominated for the 2017 European Film Awards), *Hometown* (2018), *Eurasia (Questions on Happiness)* (2018), and *Chaos Theory* (2021). Solo exhibitions include *Turnarounds*, e-flux, New York (2019), *Version History*, ICA London (2018), *Earth*, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (2018), *Hometown*, Izolyatsia, Kyiv (2018), *Information Skies*, Auto Italia, London (2016), *The Sprawl*, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco (2015), and *Islands in the Cloud*, MoMA PS1, New York (2013). Recent publications include *PSYOP: An Anthology* (Koenig Books, London, 2018), and *Digital Tarkovsky* (Strelka Press, Moscow, 2018). \n\nNot only will Metahaven be doing editorial design for *Conversations on AI*; in line with a plan that will be repeated with future Impossible Object titles, the front cover image will be minted as a standalone NFT and auctioned a little further down the line. \n\nSome of the proceeds of this will go to iODAO, Impossible Object's creator DAO.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1464387a-458e-4d20-b694-34e576c840a0.png?height=409&width=430)\n\n\n\n## How much are you aiming to raise?\n\nWe're aiming to raise up to 25 ether. This will go to:\n\n- Our dialogists: Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester, Reza Negarestani and Nick Srnicek\n- Our designer, Metahaven\n- The costs of producing, marketing and distributing the book\n- The development of web3 functionality on Impossible Object's website and forthcoming Discord server, giving $IMPOSSIBLE holders access to the benefits that this entails.\n\n## What are the different tiers of backer rewards?\n\n**Every backer**\n- $IMPOSSIBLE tokens at the rate: 1 ether = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE\n- Proportional stakes in the sale of the book's NFT as described above.\n- Proportional voting power in polls relating to the book.\n- Mention in the book's acknowledgements.\n\n**0.25 ether+**\n- The above, plus...\n- A copy of the trade paperback\n- Invitation to a 2hr Zoom roundtable on AI, led by Reza Negarestani and featuring participants in the book.\n\n**0.5 ether+**\n- huihui\n\n\n\n**0.75 ether+**\n- The above, plus...\n- A signed copy of the book.\n\n**1 ether+**\n- A one-on-one call with Reza Negarestani about anything at all (not necessarily AI!).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0b9be0ef-5b18-48c2-bb36-f3f6a864d411.png?height=493&width=634)\n\n\n\n**Futher information about the crowdfund**\n\n- The crowdfund will begin at Xpm on 25th May on this page.\n- The crowdfund is first come, first serve. Once it's closed, it will no longer be possible to make contributions.\n- You will need an Ethereum wallet and some ether to participate. If you don’t have a wallet, Rainbow’s mobile app is a good option for iOS users. Alternatively, there's Metamask (iOS, Android and web).\n- 1 ether = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE. For example, someone contributing 0.5 ether will receive 500 $IMPOSSIBLE.\n- Ether transactions involve a transaction fee (Tx fee). The level of the Tx fee varies with the price of 'gas' on the network, which can be checked [here](https://ethgasstation.info/). If gas prices are too high, wait and try again later for a more reasonable overall Tx fee.\n- If you are new to this and need any advice, reach out on the Impossible Object [Telegram group](t.me/impossibleobject). We'll do what we can to help!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c929ee03-cff5-47b6-b407-4f47ba3b10f0.jpg?height=987&width=1142)\n\n\n\n## Additional references\n\nhttps://j.mirror.xyz/uVGCCwwm3k341lPpxaJmHTZROESVse9Pe_rmbiuUAC0\n\nhttps://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ\n\nhttps://generalist.mirror.xyz/1T0h7VGDcECJuifK4TPDfRoUQ3zaO_tPwdZV-dtnNqw", "timestamp": 1621863189, "digest": "hqkBkj6ttSQfHvgdArGYPNgw9JkrlLAyZqC5UWqk3s0", "contributor": "0xc46E9a66FDdC8D1a69529d86E668236f02957F1b"}
{"id": "5hj17Rgf4xMzY-OPUdGw53eS_8zR-M5AOqfvQpx-wYs", "title": "Tech stack for decentralized cities", "body": "A [decentralized city](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/decentralized-cities/) is a network of **distinct physical locations tied together by shared governance and culture.** It allows people to maintain close social ties and norms while moving around to different places. It also creates resilience against local changes in climate, regulation, and social norms.\n\nInspired by Balaji's essay on [The Location Stack](https://1729.com/location/) for technological progressives and conversations at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) this past week, we've been thinking through a rough sketch of the tech stack for decentralized cities:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c9eff57a-48ee-4e01-bce5-6a71e784d038.jpeg?height=1725&width=1307)\n\nLike a computer, a decentralized city has hardware and software. **Hardware is the physical space**: the land, the infrastructure, and the buildings. **Software is the virtual layer**: incorporation, governance, and social interaction. \n\nThis separation allows decentralized cities to operate with compatible and interchangeable hardware and software architectures. If a physical node in the network doesn't agree with decisions being made, they can spin up a new virtual governance layer. And if a physical location becomes an untenable place to continue living, the community can migrate to a new location without losing its social and governance layers. \n\n**By decoupling these functions, everyone has a plausible [path to exit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty) and try something different.** You can imagine that virtual \"governments\" would gain and lose physical locations over time, and that physical locations could be part of multiple social and governance layers, depending on their needs:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/49e05c2c-07d5-44b5-9038-803cac2a07ab.png?height=1099&width=1704)\n\n\n## Hardware for a decentralized city\n\nThere are three layers of the physical hardware stack:\n\n1. Land\n2. Infrastructure\n3. Buildings\n\n### Land: Develop multiple exurban locations\n\nWhile the metaverse will increase our time spent in virtual realities, we still need to live in good old-fashioned physical reality. And if you want to be able to control your physical space, you need to own land.\n\nDecentralized cities need land, but a key difference that separates them from conventional cities is that the land doesn't all need to be in the same place. Multiple physical nodes in the network allow flexibility and a plausible path to exit from any specific location. \n\nWhere should these nodes be located? The best living locations through quality-of-life factors like:\n\n- **Cost**: housing, food, taxes...\n- **Environment**: climate, access to nature...\n- **Infrastructure**: internet speed, airports, healthcare...\n- **Culture**: access to dining, museums, concerts...\n- **Regulation**: the ability to build, experiment...\n\n**We believe that exurban environments provide the best trade-off among these factors for decentralized cities.** They have relatively low costs and regulations and provide access to both nature and urban areas.\n\nUnincorporated areas approximately 30 minutes - 1 hour outside of core urban areas seem to be ideal. For example, we've located the first Creator Cabins location in an exurban sweet spot, out in nature but only 45 minutes from downtown Austin:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac2d734f-8a1d-4e38-9f59-c8c59639f090.jpg?height=1512&width=1926)\n\n\n### Infrastructure: Go off-grid \n\nTo build a robust decentralized city node, off-the-grid technologies make up the core infrastructure tech stack. Solar panels, fixed wireless or satellite internet, a well, and a septic system can provide for an entirely independent retreat. Here are some pictures of our infra set-up:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5085a095-c5d9-4873-b302-035da188e624.jpg?height=1333&width=1961)\n\nThere are probably several whole posts to be written about lessons learned putting in our infrastructure. But generally speaking, these technologies have gotten good enough that you can create a functioning outpost on your own infrastructure nearly anywhere in the world. With the proliferation of 5G and Starlink, internet access will soon be very fast in most places. \n\n\n### Buildings: design for community and flexibility\n\nThe physical buildings should be suited to the target citizens of your decentralized city. We recommend [A Pattern Language](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199) as a guide to the principles of spatial design of physical communities. In our case, we designed the new cabin from the ground up for creator co-living and working. It features private bedroom suites with built-in desks and large connected public areas for social interaction and collaboration: \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e626a4ec-2085-4f7c-910e-c8ee2d05120f.png?height=1708&width=2462)\n\nWe partnered with [Forte Shelter](https://www.forteshelter.com/) to pre-fabricate this cabin out of shipping containers. It's an inherently modular and extensible design. While pre-fab construction is not a panacea, **it also allows the flexibility to install similar cabins anywhere in the world and move existing cabins to new locations if needed**:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11103b3b-578b-46f0-914f-4cab39355273.jpg?height=1174&width=1710)\n\nOther flexible living options like [Kibbo](https://www.kibbo.com/) could allow for even easier migration of living spaces. Chenoe Hart has written about [the ways in which self-driving technology may blur the lines between vehicles and buildings](https://reallifemag.com/perpetual-motion-machines/). \n\n\n## Software for a decentralized city\n\nDecentralized cities run on three primary layers of the software stack:\n\n1. Incorporation\n2. Governance\n3. Social\n\n### Remote incorporation\n\nIn Balaji's [Location Stack](https://1729.com/location/) post, he asks for people to help research options for jurisdictions friendly to tech progressives. Posts like [this one](https://dougantin.com/remote-work-the-tech-enabled-exit/) walk-through options for living tailored to local governance preferences. But the underlying assumption is that the place you live is also the place you will be governed. This may always be true, but it doesn't have to be. \n\nTraditionally, cities are in a single place and are incorporated locally. **But much like startups now incorporate in Delaware regardless of where they do business, cities may start to incorporate in one place and then do their work in many places.** Wyoming creating a legal structure for DAOs could make it a compelling option for incorporating a city. \n\nI am not a lawyer, and state laws aren't going anywhere. But decentralized cities with remote incorporation could actually work elegantly within the existing structures of American federalism. The idea of powers left to local governing bodies is core to the structure of the US Constitution. \n\nIf local governance isn't tied to a single location, where does it happen? On-chain.\n\n\n### On-chain governance\n\nBlockchains are a natural fit for decentralized city governance. They allow for open access, transportability, and a permanent and inalterable historical record.\n\nOne of my favorite characters of Texas history is [Angelina Eberly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Eberly), an innkeeper who protected Texas' government records with a cannon when Sam Houston (then the president of Texas) tried to forcibly relocate the state capital from Austin to his namesake town of Houston. There's a statue to honor her near the capitol in downtown Austin:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b6a9b444-019a-475e-920f-0f0c39e60ca2.jpg?height=912&width=1600)\n\nThe [Texas Archive War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Archive_War), as it was called, isn't possible when the governance records are located on a blockchain. **Anyone can look at the records at any time from anywhere, and no one can change them.**\n\nWe are experimenting with this at Creator Cabins by launching CabinDAO, [a token-based governance structure for funding and awarding creator residencies at our cabins](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/crowdfunded-creator-residencies/). Stay tuned for our $CABIN crowdfund on Mirror later this week!\n\n\n### Off-chain social communication & connection\n\nWhile Web3 provides an ideal governance layer for decentralized cities, we can borrow lessons from Web2 in developing the social layer to tie decentralized communities together.\n\nIn the 20th century, people gathered in churches that represented shared cultural, social, and religious values. We need new ways of doing this in the 21st century:\n\n> The internet era has opened us to the possibility of curating and creating our own tailored practices and to looking to our peers for guidance as much as any teacher or authority figure\n\n*[The Power of Ritual](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Ritual-Everyday-Activities-Practices/dp/0062881817), Casper ter Kuile*\n\nAs traditional religion falls by the wayside, people are developing new structures of accountability and community connection. The social layer of decentralized cities can provide these services. \n\nTools for social connection, community onboarding, reputation management, and member recruiting can all draw from existing Web2 models. However, because these tools will be owned and operated collectively by the community, they can be designed to exclusively serve the users instead of advertisers or other attention economy intermediaries. \n\n\n## A rough sketch\n\nThis post provides a rough outline of a tech stack, but take the implementation details with a grain of salt. They are our best guess from an initial exploration of the idea maze, not an ideal solution. We'd love to hear from other people thinking about building innovative living spaces and organizing social and governance structures. **After all, only through many experiments with hardware and software stacks will we start to evolve a network of nodes in the first decentralized cities. **\n\n\n*Acknowledgments: thanks to Jon Gold, Zachary Fleischmann, Lauren Alexander for feedback, edits, and ideas*\n\n", "timestamp": 1621865291, "digest": "-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

It features private bedroom suites with built-in desks and large connected public areas for social interaction and collaboration: \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e626a4ec-2085-4f7c-910e-c8ee2d05120f.png?height=1708&width=2462)\n\nWe partnered with [Forte Shelter](https://www.forteshelter.com/) to pre-fabricate this cabin out of shipping containers. It's an inherently modular and extensible design. While pre-fab construction is not a panacea, **it also allows the flexibility to install similar cabins anywhere in the world and move existing cabins to new locations if needed**:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11103b3b-578b-46f0-914f-4cab39355273.jpg?height=1174&width=1710)\n\nOther flexible living options like [Kibbo](https://www.kibbo.com/) could allow for even easier migration of living spaces. Chenoe Hart has written about [the ways in which self-driving technology may blur the lines between vehicles and buildings](https://reallifemag.com/perpetual-motion-machines/). \n\n\n## Software for a decentralized city\n\nDecentralized cities run on three primary layers of the software stack:\n\n1. Incorporation\n2. Governance\n3. Social\n\n### Remote incorporation\n\nIn Balaji's [Location Stack](https://1729.com/location/) post, he asks for people to help research options for jurisdictions friendly to tech progressives. Posts like [this one](https://dougantin.com/remote-work-the-tech-enabled-exit/) walk-through options for living tailored to local governance preferences. But the underlying assumption is that the place you live is also the place you will be governed. This may always be true, but it doesn't have to be. \n\nTraditionally, cities are in a single place and are incorporated locally. **But much like startups now incorporate in Delaware regardless of where they do business, cities may start to incorporate in one place and then do their work in many places.** Wyoming creating a legal structure for DAOs could make it a compelling option for incorporating a city. \n\nI am not a lawyer, and state laws aren't going anywhere. But decentralized cities with remote incorporation could actually work elegantly within the existing structures of American federalism. The idea of powers left to local governing bodies is core to the structure of the US Constitution. \n\nIf local governance isn't tied to a single location, where does it happen? On-chain.\n\n\n### On-chain governance\n\nBlockchains are a natural fit for decentralized city governance. They allow for open access, transportability, and a permanent and inalterable historical record.\n\nOne of my favorite characters of Texas history is [Angelina Eberly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Eberly), an innkeeper who protected Texas' government records with a cannon when Sam Houston (then the president of Texas) tried to forcibly relocate the state capital from Austin to his namesake town of Houston. There's a statue to honor her near the capitol in downtown Austin:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b6a9b444-019a-475e-920f-0f0c39e60ca2.jpg?height=912&width=1600)\n\nThe [Texas Archive War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Archive_War), as it was called, isn't possible when the governance records are located on a blockchain. **Anyone can look at the records at any time from anywhere, and no one can change them.**\n\nWe are experimenting with this at Creator Cabins by launching CabinDAO, [a token-based governance structure for funding and awarding creator residencies at our cabins](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/crowdfunded-creator-residencies/). Stay tuned for our $CABIN crowdfund on Mirror later this week!\n\n\n### Off-chain social communication & connection\n\nWhile Web3 provides an ideal governance layer for decentralized cities, we can borrow lessons from Web2 in developing the social layer to tie decentralized communities together.\n\nIn the 20th century, people gathered in churches that represented shared cultural, social, and religious values. We need new ways of doing this in the 21st century:\n\n> The internet era has opened us to the possibility of curating and creating our own tailored practices and to looking to our peers for guidance as much as any teacher or authority figure\n\n*[The Power of Ritual](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Ritual-Everyday-Activities-Practices/dp/0062881817), Casper ter Kuile*\n\nAs traditional religion falls by the wayside, people are developing new structures of accountability and community connection. The social layer of decentralized cities can provide these services. \n\nTools for social connection, community onboarding, reputation management, and member recruiting can all draw from existing Web2 models. However, because these tools will be owned and operated collectively by the community, they can be designed to exclusively serve the users instead of advertisers or other attention economy intermediaries. \n\n\n## A rough sketch\n\nThis post provides a rough outline of a tech stack, but take the implementation details with a grain of salt. They are our best guess from an initial exploration of the idea maze, not an ideal solution. We'd love to hear from other people thinking about building innovative living spaces and organizing social and governance structures. **After all, only through many experiments with hardware and software stacks will we start to evolve a network of nodes in the first decentralized cities.**\n\n\n*Acknowledgments: thanks to Jon Gold, Zachary Fleischmann, Lauren Alexander for feedback, edits, and ideas*\n\n", "timestamp": 1621865458, "digest": "-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

I’ve watched Phil for thirty years and I’ve seen all of the highs and lows and there have been many. He plays the game of golf with a level of creativity that can often lead to problems. He is a risk-taker which isn’t always the best way to approach a golf course.\n\nBut this weekend at the PGA, he was simply better than anyone else. He hit the ball as far as players thirty years younger than he is. And he showed off his incredible short game.\n\nWe have now seen this a few times, where athletes who are “past their prime” continue to be better than anyone else, at least for a game or a long weekend.\n\nSome of this is due to the better conditioning that today’s athletes are in. Some of it is that they are older and wiser and have been there before and understand how to handle the moment. And some of it is that they are the best of their generation and that level of talent goes a long way.\n\nI think us “old timers” can take some lessons from Phil and other athletes who are outperforming well beyond their prime. We can stay in the game to start. We can figure out what our version of learning how to hit the ball as far as the youngsters is. And we can take comfort in the fact that we have been in this moment before and know how to take a breath, calm down, and make the right decision.

{"id": "4arjOccW8xJ-e6lLHOUeZQI8p0mIItUYgIrWK-ploR8", "title": "Tech stack for decentralized cities", "body": "A [decentralized city](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/decentralized-cities/) is a network of **distinct physical locations tied together by shared governance and culture.** It allows people to maintain close social ties and norms while moving around to different places. It also creates resilience against local changes in climate, regulation, and social norms.\n\nInspired by Balaji's essay on [The Location Stack](https://1729.com/location/) for technological progressives and conversations at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) this past week, we've been thinking through a rough sketch of the tech stack for decentralized cities:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c9eff57a-48ee-4e01-bce5-6a71e784d038.jpeg?height=1725&width=1307)\n\nLike a computer, a decentralized city has hardware and software. **Hardware is the physical space**: the land, the infrastructure, and the buildings. **Software is the virtual layer**: incorporation, governance, and social interaction. \n\nThis separation allows decentralized cities to operate with compatible and interchangeable hardware and software architectures. If a physical node in the network doesn't agree with decisions being made, they can spin up a new virtual governance layer. And if a physical location becomes an untenable place to continue living, the community can migrate to a new location without losing its social and governance layers. \n\n**By decoupling these functions, everyone has a plausible [path to exit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty) and try something different.** You can imagine that virtual \"governments\" would gain and lose physical locations over time, and that physical locations could be part of multiple social and governance layers, depending on their needs:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/49e05c2c-07d5-44b5-9038-803cac2a07ab.png?height=1099&width=1704)\n\n\n## Hardware for a decentralized city\n\nThere are three layers of the physical hardware stack:\n\n1. Land\n2. Infrastructure\n3. Buildings\n\n### Land: Develop multiple exurban locations\n\nWhile the metaverse will increase our time spent in virtual realities, we still need to live in good old-fashioned physical reality. And if you want to be able to control your physical space, you need to own land.\n\nDecentralized cities need land, but a key difference that separates them from conventional cities is that the land doesn't all need to be in the same place. Multiple physical nodes in the network allow flexibility and a plausible path to exit from any specific location. \n\nWhere should these nodes be located? The best living locations through quality-of-life factors like:\n\n- **Cost**: housing, food, taxes...\n- **Environment**: climate, access to nature...\n- **Infrastructure**: internet speed, airports, healthcare...\n- **Culture**: access to dining, museums, concerts...\n- **Regulation**: the ability to build, experiment...\n\n**We believe that exurban environments provide the best trade-off among these factors for decentralized cities.** They have relatively low costs and regulations and provide access to both nature and urban areas.\n\nUnincorporated areas approximately 30 minutes - 1 hour outside of core urban areas seem to be ideal. For example, we've located the first Creator Cabins location in an exurban sweet spot, out in nature but only 45 minutes from downtown Austin:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac2d734f-8a1d-4e38-9f59-c8c59639f090.jpg?height=1512&width=1926)\n\n\n### Infrastructure: Go off-grid \n\nTo build a robust decentralized city node, off-the-grid technologies make up the core infrastructure tech stack. Solar panels, fixed wireless or satellite internet, a well, and a septic system can provide for an entirely independent retreat. Here are some pictures of our infra set-up:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5085a095-c5d9-4873-b302-035da188e624.jpg?height=1333&width=1961)\n\nThere are probably several whole posts to be written about lessons learned putting in our infrastructure. But generally speaking, these technologies have gotten good enough that you can create a functioning outpost on your own infrastructure nearly anywhere in the world. With the proliferation of 5G and Starlink, internet access will soon be very fast in most places. \n\n\n### Buildings: design for community and flexibility\n\nThe physical buildings should be suited to the target citizens of your decentralized city. We recommend [A Pattern Language](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199) as a guide to the principles of spatial design of physical communities. In our case, we designed the new cabin from the ground up for creator co-living and working.

We're situated on 28 acres of land about 45 minutes from downtown Austin, and we just built a new cabin designed as a collaborative co-living and working space for independent online creators. It's the first node in what we hope will one day be a [decentralized city](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/decentralized-cities/):\n\n[PICTURE OF CABIN]\n\nWe're setting up a DAO to manage the crowdfund. All contributors will be awarded $CABIN tokens, which can be used to vote for residency proposals. While the DAO will ultimately govern the use of the funds, here's a rough sketch of how we are thinking about structuring the program:\n\nWe want to crowdfund 12 months worth of time staying at the cabins. This would allow us to fund 12 creators to come for a one-month stay each. We have four bedrooms available, so we could run three cohorts of four creators each. \n\nThe DAO will set up an open application process (perhaps similar to $WRITE RACE), and the winners will be invited to Creator Cabins outside of Austin, TX to work on their proposals. At the end of the month, we will help each creator mint an NFT representing their residency. The NFTs could be held and curated by the CabinDAO treasury or sold with a split of the proceeds going to the artist and back to the DAO.\n\n\nThis project came together over the course of a two-week stay at Creator Cabins. We didn't go into our stay intending to make this——the plan emerged from two weeks of interesting conversations and collaboration at the cabins. In particular, we'd like to thank <<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>. We hope this residency program can help inspire more collaborative projects like this one. \n\n[PICTURE?]\n\nFAQs\n\n**Who is eligible for a residency?**\n\nAnyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of creators: digital artists, musicians, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders, YOU. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of Web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide. \n\n**How will the money be spent?**\n\nWe are budgeting 1/3rd of an ETH per creator-week for room and board, so 16 ETH can fund 3 cohorts (12 creators for a total of 48 weeks at the cabins). \n\n**What happens with the other 50% of $CABIN?**\n\nThe DAO will retain 50% of $CABIN tokens to give to artists upon completion of their residencies, future supporters of the residency program, and whoever else the DAO decides to grant them to.\n\n**\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1621866816, "digest": "bq669jDh2Rra9sE0qhYv0zYrn-rZRvtGJM1mspQ3Ok8", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

This means we'll be publishing innovative books the old-fashioned way, as trade paperbacks and eBooks. But we're also attempting something completely new: simultaneously releasing on the blockchain so that we can use crypto's capacities to help make new kinds of book.\n\n*Conversations on AI* will be the first result of this experiment. Crypto has already provided solutions for crowdfunding [fiction](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), [science](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/41443491289334730858714141368268395642829177615924976808738423867555824271361) and [music](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM); now it's philosophy's turn.

And the topic that turned out to unite their interests was Artificial Intelligence. \n\nThese thinkers have previously dealt with AI from various angles: some have written about AI directly (Reza Negarestani's *Intelligence and Spirit* and Nick Srnicek's work on the political economy of AI), some engage with AI as a collaborator (Holly Herndon, Mat Dryhurst and SPAWN), while some have developed the notion of artificiality in itself as a means out of conceptual deadlock (Helen Hester and Benjamin Bratton).\n\nIn the three conversations on the topic, AI will act more as a crossroads than the sole focus. Our dialogists are fascinated by the impact that AI will have on politics, art, philosophy, education, terraforming, and many more things, meaning that although the dialogues may consistently pass through AI, they will almost certainly end up at surprising destinations.\n\nReza's short essay on the themes of *Conversations on AI* can be found [here](https://r.mirror.xyz/zghnOjS2aVlowlZ5D7ocnswHVSLSe04ZG-ubaMFBHmI).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3650eb7b-b2d7-405a-833e-e96ab8ae0adc.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Reza Negarestani** is a philosopher and a former systems engineer. Since the early 2000s, he has contributed extensively to journals and anthologies, and lectured at numerous international universities and institutes including Duke University, MIT, École Normale Supérieure, and Haus der Kulturen der Welt among others. Negarestani’s writings have been translated to twelve languages. Negarestani’s latest philosophical work is *Intelligence and Spirit*(Urbanomic/Sequence Press/MIT, 2018), a book investigating the meaning of intelligence at the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, theory of computation and the philosophy of German Idealism.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/36c1d3cb-b3d1-4273-85f4-ece4dbedcd0c.png?height=700&width=500)\n\n**Benjamin Bratton's** work spans Philosophy, Art, Design and Computer Science. He is Professor of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego. He is Program Director of The Terraforming programme at Strelka Institute of Media, Architecture and Design in Moscow. He is also a Visiting Professor at The European Graduate School,  SCI_Arc (The Southern California Institute of Architecture) and NYU Shanghai. He is the author of several books including *The Revenge of The Real: Politics for a Post-Pandemic World *(Verso, 2021) and *The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty*  (MIT Press, 2015).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5cb5a2e-846b-429c-b790-33688ae2084f.png?height=400&width=650)\n\n**Mathew Dryhurst** is an artist and researcher based in Berlin, Germany. His research focuses on technical and ethical protocols. He makes music and creates art with Holly Herndon, and their albums *Proto* and *Platform* (4AD) have provoked international critical acclaim. He teaches at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, Strelka Institute and European Graduate School. He previously served as Director of Programming at Gray Area in San Francisco.\n\n**Holly Herndon** is an American composer, musician, and sound artist based in Berlin, Germany. After studying composition at Stanford University and completing her Ph.D. at Stanford University’s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics, she pursued a music career internationally. Herndon's music often includes human singing voices (including her own), is primarily computer-based, and regularly uses the visual programming language Max/MSP to create custom instruments and vocal processes.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d282a589-ee4b-4fc1-8a3f-5591651e2b5b.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Helen Hester** is Professor of Gender, Technology and Work at the University of West London. Her research interests include technology, social reproduction, and the future of work, and she is a member of the international feminist working group Laboria Cuboniks. Her books include *Beyond Explicit: Pornography and the Displacement of Sex* (SUNY Press, 2014), *Xenofeminism* (Polity, 2018), and *After Work: The Politics of Free Time* (Verso, 2022, with Nick Srnicek).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/088cd853-c10f-45b6-a521-c961f6b87d21.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n\n**Nick Srnicek** is a Lecturer in Digital Economy at King's College London.

But if you're new here, here's a lil explainer:\n\n- Holding $IMPOSSIBLE tokens not only proves you helped make the book happen in the first place, but also gives you a stake in the financial success of the book.\n- Once the book is completed, the text will be minted as an NFT on Zora and put up for a reserve auction.\n\n- When the NFT sells, its smart contract funnels funds back to $IMPOSSIBLE holders in proportion to the amount of $IMPOSSIBLE they hold.\n\n-  At that point, backers can choose to sell their $IMPOSSIBLE tokens on an exchange such as Uniswap, redeeming them for ether, or carry on holding them. Holders will receive financial upside whenever the NFT is auctioned again in the future.\n\n- $IMPOSSIBLE holders will be able to play a governance role by taking part in Snapshot polls relating to *Conversations on AI*.\n\n- That's not all. Hold on for a full explanation of additional benefits below.\n\n[Diagram of how it works?]\n\n## When will the conversations happen?\n\nAs soon as the crowdfund is over. \n\nAfter that, the publication of the book will occur in two stages.\n\n### Stage 1\n\nOnce the conversations have all taken place, they'll be published on Mirror as an eBook of approximately 50000 words – equivalent to about 200 printed pages. This will be free for all to read.\n\n### Stage 2\n\nThis is where things really start to get interesting. \n\nBefore the trade paperback is published, Impossible Object will seek responses to the dialogues from their first readership. The call for proposed responses will be open to **all** readers, not just holders of $IMPOSSIBLE. One to three of these will be published alongside the main dialogues in the first full print and electronic edition of the book. \n\nAlso, the names of the original backers and holders of the $IMPOSSIBLE token will be included the acknowledgements and logged forever on the blockchain in recognition of the role they played in making the book happen.\n\nPrinting commentaries and objections alongside the main text has a long tradition, stretching back before Descartes' *Meditations*. But with Mirror's help we're giving things a web3 twist.\n\n\n\n![Still from Metahaven's \"The Sprawl\"](https://thefader-res.cloudinary.com/private_images/w_1800,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:best/screen_shot_2016-04-20_at_21.52.37_rqwpvi/screenshot-from-i-the-sprawl-i.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Who will design the book?\nWe're excited to say that editorial design for the book and for Impossible Object's future titles will be by the incredible **Metahaven**.\n\nThe work of Metahaven consists of filmmaking, writing, and design. Films by Metahaven include *The Sprawl (Propaganda about Propaganda)* (2015), *Information Skies* (2016, nominated for the 2017 European Film Awards), *Hometown* (2018), *Eurasia (Questions on Happiness)* (2018), and *Chaos Theory* (2021). Solo exhibitions include *Turnarounds*, e-flux, New York (2019), *Version History*, ICA London (2018), *Earth*, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (2018), *Hometown*, Izolyatsia, Kyiv (2018), *Information Skies*, Auto Italia, London (2016), *The Sprawl*, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco (2015), and *Islands in the Cloud*, MoMA PS1, New York (2013). Recent publications include *PSYOP: An Anthology* (Koenig Books, London, 2018), and *Digital Tarkovsky* (Strelka Press, Moscow, 2018). \n\nNot only will Metahaven be doing editorial design for *Conversations on AI*; in line with a plan that will be repeated with future Impossible Object titles, the front cover image will be minted as a standalone NFT and auctioned a little further down the line. \n\nSome of the proceeds of this will go to iODAO, Impossible Object's creator DAO.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1464387a-458e-4d20-b694-34e576c840a0.png?height=409&width=430)\n\n\n\n## How much are you aiming to raise?\n\nWe're aiming to raise up to 25 ether. This will go to:\n\n- Our dialogists: Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester, Reza Negarestani and Nick Srnicek\n- Our designer, Metahaven\n- The costs of producing, marketing and distributing the book\n- The development of web3 functionality on Impossible Object's website and forthcoming Discord server, giving $IMPOSSIBLE holders access to the benefits that this entails.\n\n## What are the different tiers of backer rewards?\n\n**Every backer**\n- $IMPOSSIBLE tokens at the rate: 1 ether = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE\n- Proportional stakes in the sale of the book's NFT as described above.\n- Proportional voting power in polls relating to the book.\n- Mention in the book's acknowledgements.\n\n**0.25 ether+**\n- The above, plus...\n- A copy of the trade paperback\n- Invitation to a 2hr Zoom roundtable on AI, led by Reza Negarestani and featuring participants in the book.\n\n**0.5 ether+**\n- huihui\n\n\n\n**0.75 ether+**\n- The above, plus...\n- A signed copy of the book.\n\n**1 ether+**\n- A one-on-one call with Reza Negarestani about anything at all (not necessarily AI!).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0b9be0ef-5b18-48c2-bb36-f3f6a864d411.png?height=493&width=634)\n\n\n\n**Futher information about the crowdfund**\n\n- The crowdfund will begin at Xpm on 25th May on this page.\n- The crowdfund is first come, first serve. Once it's closed, it will no longer be possible to make contributions.\n- You will need an Ethereum wallet and some ether to participate. If you don’t have a wallet, Rainbow’s mobile app is a good option for iOS users. Alternatively, there's Metamask (iOS, Android and web).\n- 1 ether = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE. For example, someone contributing 0.5 ether will receive 500 $IMPOSSIBLE.\n- Ether transactions involve a transaction fee (Tx fee). The level of the Tx fee varies with the price of 'gas' on the network, which can be checked [here](https://ethgasstation.info/). If gas prices are too high, wait and try again later for a more reasonable overall Tx fee.\n- If you are new to this and need any advice, reach out on the Impossible Object [Telegram group](t.me/impossibleobject). We'll do what we can to help!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/03eff263-e1c5-452e-9700-323013ad9e5b.jpg?height=1432&width=1263)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Additional references\n\nhttps://j.mirror.xyz/uVGCCwwm3k341lPpxaJmHTZROESVse9Pe_rmbiuUAC0\n\nhttps://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ\n\nhttps://generalist.mirror.xyz/1T0h7VGDcECJuifK4TPDfRoUQ3zaO_tPwdZV-dtnNqw", "timestamp": 1621866774, "digest": "hqkBkj6ttSQfHvgdArGYPNgw9JkrlLAyZqC5UWqk3s0", "contributor": "0xc46E9a66FDdC8D1a69529d86E668236f02957F1b"}
{"id": "PWwyOaz-MCTmSTkt_Fb59S4_U9qXgEG8qoRwk2bl04o", "title": "Tech stack for decentralized cities", "body": "A [decentralized city](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/decentralized-cities/) is a network of **distinct physical locations tied together by shared governance and culture.** It allows people to maintain close social ties and norms while moving around to different places. It also creates resilience against local changes in climate, regulation, and social norms.\n\nInspired by Balaji's essay on [The Location Stack](https://1729.com/location/) for technological progressives and conversations at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) this past week, we've been thinking through a rough sketch of the tech stack for decentralized cities:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c9eff57a-48ee-4e01-bce5-6a71e784d038.jpeg?height=1725&width=1307)\n\nLike a computer, a decentralized city has hardware and software. **Hardware is the physical space**: the land, the infrastructure, and the buildings. **Software is the virtual layer**: incorporation, governance, and social interaction. \n\nThis separation allows decentralized cities to operate with compatible and interchangeable hardware and software architectures. If a physical node in the network doesn't agree with decisions being made, they can spin up a new virtual governance layer. And if a physical location becomes an untenable place to continue living, the community can migrate to a new location without losing its social and governance layers. \n\n**By decoupling these functions, everyone has a plausible [path to exit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty) and try something different.** You can imagine that virtual \"governments\" would gain and lose physical locations over time, and that physical locations could be part of multiple social and governance layers, depending on their needs:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/49e05c2c-07d5-44b5-9038-803cac2a07ab.png?height=1099&width=1704)\n\n\n## Hardware for a decentralized city\n\nThere are three layers of the physical hardware stack:\n\n1. Land\n2. Infrastructure\n3. Buildings\n\n### Land: Develop multiple exurban locations\n\nWhile the metaverse will increase our time spent in virtual realities, we still need to live in good old-fashioned physical reality. And if you want to be able to control your physical space, you need to own land.\n\nDecentralized cities need land, but a key difference that separates them from conventional cities is that the land doesn't all need to be in the same place. Multiple physical nodes in the network allow flexibility and a plausible path to exit from any specific location. \n\nWhere should these nodes be located? The best living locations through quality-of-life factors like:\n\n- **Cost**: housing, food, taxes...\n- **Environment**: climate, access to nature...\n- **Infrastructure**: internet speed, airports, healthcare...\n- **Culture**: access to dining, museums, concerts...\n- **Regulation**: the ability to build, experiment...\n\n**We believe that exurban environments provide the best trade-off among these factors for decentralized cities.** They have relatively low costs and regulations and provide access to both nature and urban areas.\n\nUnincorporated areas approximately 30 minutes - 1 hour outside of core urban areas seem to be ideal. For example, we've located the first Creator Cabins location in an exurban sweet spot, out in nature but only 45 minutes from downtown Austin:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac2d734f-8a1d-4e38-9f59-c8c59639f090.jpg?height=1512&width=1926)\n\n\n### Infrastructure: Go off-grid \n\nTo build a robust decentralized city node, off-the-grid technologies make up the core infrastructure tech stack. Solar panels, fixed wireless or satellite internet, a well, and a septic system can provide for an entirely independent retreat. Here are some pictures of our infra set-up:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5085a095-c5d9-4873-b302-035da188e624.jpg?height=1333&width=1961)\n\nThere are probably several whole posts to be written about lessons learned putting in our infrastructure. But generally speaking, these technologies have gotten good enough that you can create a functioning outpost on your own infrastructure nearly anywhere in the world. With the proliferation of 5G and Starlink, internet access will soon be very fast in most places. \n\n\n### Buildings: design for community and flexibility\n\nThe physical buildings should be suited to the target citizens of your decentralized city. We recommend [A Pattern Language](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199) as a guide to the principles of spatial design of physical communities. In our case, we designed the new cabin from the ground up for creator co-living and working. It features private bedroom suites with built-in desks and large connected public areas for social interaction and collaboration: \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e626a4ec-2085-4f7c-910e-c8ee2d05120f.png?height=1708&width=2462)\n\nWe partnered with [Forte Shelter](https://www.forteshelter.com/) to pre-fabricate this cabin out of shipping containers. It's an inherently modular and extensible design. While pre-fab construction is not a panacea, **it also allows the flexibility to install similar cabins anywhere in the world and move existing cabins to new locations if needed**:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11103b3b-578b-46f0-914f-4cab39355273.jpg?height=1174&width=1710)\n\nOther flexible living options like [Kibbo](https://www.kibbo.com/) could allow for even easier migration of living spaces. Chenoe Hart has written about [the ways in which self-driving technology may blur the lines between vehicles and buildings](https://reallifemag.com/perpetual-motion-machines/). \n\n\n## Software for a decentralized city\n\nDecentralized cities run on three primary layers of the software stack:\n\n1. Incorporation\n2. Governance\n3. Social\n\n### Remote incorporation\n\nIn Balaji's [Location Stack](https://1729.com/location/) post, he asks for people to help research options for jurisdictions friendly to tech progressives. Posts like [this one](https://dougantin.com/remote-work-the-tech-enabled-exit/) walk-through options for living tailored to local governance preferences. But the underlying assumption is that the place you live is also the place you will be governed. This may always be true, but it doesn't have to be. \n\nTraditionally, cities are in a single place and are incorporated locally. **But much like startups now incorporate in Delaware regardless of where they do business, cities may start to incorporate in one place and then do their work in many places.** Wyoming creating a legal structure for DAOs could make it a compelling option for incorporating a city. \n\nI am not a lawyer, and state laws aren't going anywhere. But decentralized cities with remote incorporation could actually work elegantly within the existing structures of American federalism. The idea of powers left to local governing bodies is core to the structure of the US Constitution. \n\nIf local governance isn't tied to a single location, where does it happen? On-chain.\n\n\n### On-chain governance\n\nBlockchains are a natural fit for decentralized city governance. They allow for open access, transportability, and a permanent and inalterable historical record.\n\nOne of my favorite characters of Texas history is [Angelina Eberly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Eberly), an innkeeper who protected Texas' government records with a cannon when Sam Houston (then the president of Texas) tried to forcibly relocate the state capital from Austin to his namesake town of Houston. There's a statue to honor her near the capitol in downtown Austin:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b6a9b444-019a-475e-920f-0f0c39e60ca2.jpg?height=912&width=1600)\n\nThe [Texas Archive War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Archive_War), as it was called, isn't possible when the governance records are located on a blockchain. **Anyone can look at the records at any time from anywhere, and no one can change them.**\n\nWe are experimenting with this at Creator Cabins by launching CabinDAO, [a token-based governance structure for funding and awarding creator residencies at our cabins](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/crowdfunded-creator-residencies/). Stay tuned for our $CABIN crowdfund on Mirror later this week!\n\n\n### Off-chain social communication & connection\n\nWhile Web3 provides an ideal governance layer for decentralized cities, we can borrow lessons from Web2 in developing the social layer to tie decentralized communities together.\n\nIn the 20th century, people gathered in churches that represented shared cultural, social, and religious values. We need new ways of doing this in the 21st century:\n\n> The internet era has opened us to the possibility of curating and creating our own tailored practices and to looking to our peers for guidance as much as any teacher or authority figure\n\n*[The Power of Ritual](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Ritual-Everyday-Activities-Practices/dp/0062881817), Casper ter Kuile*\n\nAs traditional religion falls by the wayside, people are developing new structures of accountability and community connection. The social layer of decentralized cities can provide these services. \n\nTools for social connection, community onboarding, reputation management, and member recruiting can all draw from existing Web2 models. However, because these tools will be owned and operated collectively by the community, they can be designed to exclusively serve the users instead of advertisers or other attention economy intermediaries. \n\n\n## A rough sketch\n\nThis post provides a rough outline of a tech stack, but take the implementation details with a grain of salt. They are our best guess from an initial exploration of the idea maze, not an ideal solution. We'd love to hear from other people thinking about building innovative living spaces and organizing social and governance structures. **After all, only through many experiments with hardware and software stacks will we start to evolve a network of nodes in the first decentralized cities.**\n\n\n\n\n*Acknowledgments: thanks to Jon Gold, Zachary Fleischmann, Lauren Alexander for feedback, edits, and ideas*\n\n", "timestamp": 1621866751, "digest": "-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

Ship PartyBid: a product / standard for creating popup DAOs that can bid on NFTs\n2. Build PartyDAO itself into a long-lasting organization that can fund its own continued existence\n\nPartyDAO is different from many DAOs that have come before it. To date, DAOs have mostly been synonymous with a treasury of funds + group voting on where to send those funds. PartyDAO aims to be something else: **we are a fully decentralized organization that actually ships products**.\n\nAlready, PartyDAO has assembled a group of members with strong capabilities in design, engineering, smart contract development, and writing. As we build this first product, we will use these skills to ship a product at a quality level typically only seen at top-tier startups. In doing so, we will begin to expand on the idea of what a DAO is capable of.\n\nOver the next several weeks, we will also progress towards the much larger opportunity of building a long-lasting organization. We’ll establish the PartyDAO identity and continue to build up a list of members with skills we can call on. Though we are building things together, we are not a company. We are a group of autonomous individuals that can coordinate around shared projects that we all own a part of.\n\n---\n\nIn the immediate, we have 2 primary work streams to pursue in parallel.\n\nFirst, we have begun building PartyBid V1. In the past week, we've cemented our V1 spec and selected a team responsible for project management, design, and development. That team consists of the following members, and development is now underway.\n\n- Project Lead: [John Palmer](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer)\n- Lead solidity developer: [Anna Carroll](https://twitter.com/annascarroll)\n- Designer: [Callil Capuozzo](https://twitter.com/_callil)\n- Web developer: [Anish Agnihotri](https://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri)\n- Solidity reviewers: [Steve Klabenoff](https://twitter.com/steveklbnf), [Graeme Boy](https://twitter.com/strangechances), and [Arpit Agarwal](https://twitter.com/atvanguard)\n\nSecond, we have slowly begun building PartyDAO itself. While only a few individuals are building PartyBid V1, every member is a part of establishing the DAO as an organization by sharing what we're up to and inviting new members to join.\n\nAs far as this goes, we've made initial progress by creating our publication on Mirror and publishing this first post. Additionally, we've collborated with [GraphixSlayer](https://twitter.com/GraphixSlayer) to create our official mascot, Kazoo.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/25356535-e48f-47ee-a221-c61993d17056.jpeg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\n---\n\nOver the coming weeks, we'll have a lot more to share here. What's shaping up in the PartyDAO Discord already resembles much more established crypto projects, and development progress is moving forward quickly. On top of that, everyone is having a good time.", "timestamp": 1621872026, "digest": "xte55cT3ESlQRP62KYxupRbha7A1O6MMHhKMIzfmLyg", "contributor": "0xB0623C91c65621df716aB8aFE5f66656B21A9108"}

There is also a one-of-one Zora NFT for the official *Form* music video, auctioning off on Zora. \n\nYou can see who the recipients are for each of the 4 Catalog NFTs being auctioned below. These are the collaborators (writers, producers, engineers) I created this music with. \n\n## Track No. 3 — Sand\n\n*Sand* is written by Danny Majic + myself, and produced by Danny Majic.\n\nThis was the first song Danny and I ever wrote together, the very day we met each other. This was also the very first song I wrote after a 10-day cross-country solo drive from Montreal, Canada to Los Angeles, California. \n\n[Token #3166](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3166)\n\n## Track No. 4 — Red Balloons\n\n*Red Balloons* is written by Hayley Gene Penner, Jason Yik Nam Wu + myself, and produced by Rabitt.\n\nThis is the first song I've ever released with a co-written top-line. I've always found it difficult to write lyrics and melody with others, but Hayley is a great friend and we truly found a shared energy on this one. And Rabitt always brings the goods. \n\n[Token #3167](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3167)\n\n## Track No. 5 — Crazy\n\n*Crazy* is written by Danny Majic + myself, and produced by Danny Majic.\n\nWe wrote this song together at a songwriting camp in Nashville, Tennessee.

Attached to said studio was the very house we were both living in at the time. This was the last song we wrote together, before I left for Montreal when the pandemic began. A version of the song was first released on streaming platforms in May 2020, on a charity album raising money for MusiCares' Covid Relief Fund. \n\n[Token #3169](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3169)\n\nAs you can see in the auctions above above, **5% of funds received are going towards my private community *Homemade Universe*’s shared treasury**.

We started writing this song on my birthday. It was the first time Matt and I had ever worked together. \n\nThe song is nearly finished, but has an empty second verse that needs a feature. Hence, the ***Flavors Feature Contest***. Anyone who collects an NFT or purchases an album bundle copy receives one (1) entry into the contest. \n\nAfter your purchase and/or collection, you’ll receive a private download of the album. Included will be an mp3 of Flavors with an open second verse. You can use that file to start writing your verse. You will also gain access to the Homemade Universe discord server, where you will be able to submit your version of Flavors. Submissions will close on June 20 2021. \n\nA winner will then be chosen to be the official feature of Flavors. The final version of the song with your verse on it will then be released as a 1/1 Catalog NFT and, eventually, on the Textures OF A Long Forgotten Assumption album release on streaming platforms. \n\n**The winner will also receive this 1/1 collectible NFT of Flavors, as well as 10% of the master’s future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties etc).**\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:1012987:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\n### **Track no. 8 — *Paint*** + the *Silent Auction*\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/1012935)\n\nThe song *Paint* is still in a very early demo stage. In fact, I don’t yet have a chorus for it. I wrote the beginnings of this song with Danny Majic, and have always loved the first verse and pre-chorus. But there is still a ways to go on this song, and I am looking for 1 partner to join along for the ride. \n\nThis partner will be the ***creative director*** for the song *Paint* — and this role can look many different ways. Perhaps you’re a musician and can help with the songwriting or production of the song, perhaps you’re visual artists and can help on the visual side. Perhaps you don’t consider yourself an artist whatsoever, but can help on the outreach and marketing side. Perhaps you just want to get a closer look into the makings of a song, and just want to take pictures of the process on your disposable camera. Whatever it may be! This creative director position is yours to fill however you choose, should you win it of course. \n\nNow, how do you win it?\n\nThe *Paint* collectible is a 1/1 NFT on Rarible, and is up for **Silent Auction**. \n\nYes, that’s correct. Silent Auction. \n\nTo win this auction, you must email me your bid. \n\nThat’s correct. Email me your bid at paintauctionbid@gmail.com. \n\nYour bid can be in ETH, it can be in USD, it can be in CAD, or DOGE or WRITE or any other currency on the planet. It can also be a non-currency bid! It can be a barter of some kind — maybe a good or maybe a service. Anything! Get creative! \n\nThis is for the role of creative director on the song. So show me your creativity. And show me how much you want it. :)\n\nOnce the first bid is in, a 24-hour countdown will commence. I will announce updates on the Silent Auction in real-time on [twitter](https://twitter.com/matthewchaim). \n\n**The winner will be the official creative director for *Paint*, win this 1/1 collectible NFT, and receive 10% of the master’s future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties etc).**\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:1012935:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\n### **Track no. 9 — *Untitled*** + the *Untitled Creative Director DAO*\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430/572927)\n\nGrab your [**entry NFT into the *Untitled Creative Director DAO* here**](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details).\n\n1 creative director is great. But what about 100? \n\nYes, that’s correct. 100 creative directors. \n\nThat is what I am in search of for this last song on the album, which does not yet even have a name. As you can see, we have our work cut out for ourselves. \n\nIn fact, I’m not even sure which demo on mine should be the 9th and final song on the project. There are a few options that I really love, but I need your help to decide on which one to pursue. That is where we will start our collective decision making. Here’s how it works:\n\nThe Untitled collectible is a **100 edition** NFT on [Rarible](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details), with each edition priced at **0.03 ETH**. I ask that you purchase a maximum of **1 edition per wallet**. \n\nThe Untitled collectible NFT will act as the access token into a gated set of channels on the Homemade Universe discord, where this community of 100 people will convene and begin the creative direction of the song. \n\n**Each edition represents 1 vote in the *Untitled Creative Director DAO* that will be formed to govern the completion of this final song of the album, as well as 0.1% of the master’s future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties, etc). This means that 100 people will together own 10% of the song’s final master.**\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\n# THE COPIES\n\nThe final form this album is being released today is with **1000 album bundle copies**, [available for purchase on my online shop here](https://ko-fi.com/s/794a026bac). \n\nThis bundle comes with:\n1. the first 7 tracks off the album, including *Flavors* with the empty second verse\n2. 8 pieces of album artwork\n3. one (1) invitation to *Homemade Universe*\n4. one (1) entry into the *Flavors Feature Contest* (more info in the Collectibles section above\n\nAfter your purchase, you will receive an access card into the Homemade Universe discord — which will give you access to the private set of channels available to members. \n\nThe album bundle will be available for up to two weeks or up to 1000 copies, whichever comes first. \n\n**You can [purchase an album bundle copy here](https://ko-fi.com/s/794a026bac).**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f29b829a-3e2e-4aba-aee9-2ab41f399355.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\n# A Final Thought \n\nIn building this release out, I realized I missed one more word in my cute little alliteration. \n\nThe full phrase should go → Canon, Collectibles, Copies, and *Community*. \n\nThis project in some ways only *begins* today, in that it is the first page in our story of exploring collective creation together. For the final 3 songs, we will begin a new journey of seeing what it is like for a community to create together in 3 very different ways — one as a contest, one as a 1-to-1 relationship, and 1 as a DAO making decisions together. It is also the beginning of exploring the possibilities around sharing in the equity of our co-creations in this way. \n\nThe other thing you may notice in the splits delineated in the *Canon* NFTs above, is my private community Homemade Universe is receiving 5% of all auction revenues. Those funds will go into a shared treasury controlled by the community, which we will use for future co-creative projects together. \n\nI’m incredibly excited to go on this new journey with you. And learn what it means to bring together like-minded individuals around my art, and create real value together. \n\nThis is just the beginning. \n\nThanks for being here. 🌻", "timestamp": 1621874445, "digest": "9EAsxtkQD6hIQJLDID5w8Jn6o_m9Bw4XnDdTwOVHttA", "contributor": "0x5090c4Fead5Be112b643BC75d61bF42339675448"}

We started writing this song on my birthday. It was the first time Matt and I had ever worked together. \n\nThe song is nearly finished, but has an empty second verse that needs a feature. Hence, the ***Flavors Feature Contest***. Anyone who collects an NFT or purchases an album bundle copy receives one (1) entry into the contest. \n\nAfter your purchase and/or collection, you’ll receive a private download of the album. Included will be an mp3 of Flavors with an open second verse. You can use that file to start writing your verse. You will also gain access to the Homemade Universe discord server, where you will be able to submit your version of Flavors. Submissions will close on June 20 2021. \n\nA winner will then be chosen to be the official feature of Flavors. The final version of the song with your verse on it will then be released as a 1/1 Catalog NFT and, eventually, on the Textures OF A Long Forgotten Assumption album release on streaming platforms. \n\n**The winner will also receive this 1/1 collectible NFT of Flavors, as well as 10% of the master’s future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties etc).**\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:1012987:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\n### **Track no. 8 — *Paint*** + the *Silent Auction*\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/1012935)\n\nThe song *Paint* is still in a very early demo stage. In fact, I don’t yet have a chorus for it. I wrote the beginnings of this song with Danny Majic, and have always loved the first verse and pre-chorus. But there is still a ways to go on this song, and I am looking for 1 partner to join along for the ride. \n\nThis partner will be the ***creative director*** for the song *Paint* — and this role can look many different ways. Perhaps you’re a musician and can help with the songwriting or production of the song, perhaps you’re visual artists and can help on the visual side. Perhaps you don’t consider yourself an artist whatsoever, but can help on the outreach and marketing side. Perhaps you just want to get a closer look into the makings of a song, and just want to take pictures of the process on your disposable camera. Whatever it may be! This creative director position is yours to fill however you choose, should you win it of course. \n\nNow, how do you win it?\n\nThe *Paint* collectible is a 1/1 NFT on Rarible, and is up for **Silent Auction**. \n\nYes, that’s correct. Silent Auction. \n\nTo win this auction, you must email me your bid. \n\nThat’s correct. Email me your bid at paintauctionbid@gmail.com. \n\nYour bid can be in ETH, it can be in USD, it can be in CAD, or DOGE or WRITE or any other currency on the planet. It can also be a non-currency bid! It can be a barter of some kind — maybe a good or maybe a service. Anything! Get creative! \n\nThis is for the role of creative director on the song. So show me your creativity. And show me how much you want it. :)\n\nOnce the first bid is in, a 24-hour countdown will commence. I will announce updates on the Silent Auction in real-time on [twitter](https://twitter.com/matthewchaim). \n\n**The winner will be the official creative director for *Paint*, win this 1/1 collectible NFT, and receive 10% of the master’s future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties etc).**\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:1012935:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\n### **Track no. 9 — *Untitled*** + the *Untitled Creative Director DAO*\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430/572927)\n\nGrab your [**entry NFT into the *Untitled Creative Director DAO* here**](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details).\n\n1 creative director is great.

As you can see, we have our work cut out for ourselves. \n\nIn fact, I’m not even sure which demo on mine should be the 9th and final song on the project. There are a few options that I really love, but I need your help to decide on which one to pursue. That is where we will start our collective decision making. Here’s how it works:\n\nThe Untitled collectible is a **100 edition** NFT on [Rarible](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details), with each edition priced at **0.03 ETH**. I ask that you purchase a maximum of **1 edition per wallet**. \n\nThe Untitled collectible NFT will act as the access token into a gated set of channels on the Homemade Universe discord, where this community of 100 people will convene and begin the creative direction of the song. \n\n**Each edition represents 1 vote in the *Untitled Creative Director DAO* that will be formed to govern the completion of this final song of the album, as well as 0.1% of the master’s future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties, etc).

For the final 3 songs, we will begin a new journey of seeing what it is like for a community to create together in 3 very different ways — one as a contest, one as a 1-to-1 relationship, and 1 as a DAO making decisions together. It is also the beginning of exploring the possibilities around sharing in the equity of our co-creations in this way. \n\nThe other thing you may notice in the splits delineated in the *Canon* NFTs above, is my private community Homemade Universe is receiving 5% of all auction revenues. Those funds will go into a shared treasury controlled by the community, which we will use for future co-creative projects together. \n\nI’m incredibly excited to go on this new journey with you. And learn what it means to bring together like-minded individuals around my art, and create real value together. \n\nThis is just the beginning. \n\nThanks for being here. 🌻", "timestamp": 1621874555, "digest": "9EAsxtkQD6hIQJLDID5w8Jn6o_m9Bw4XnDdTwOVHttA", "contributor": "0x5090c4Fead5Be112b643BC75d61bF42339675448"}

What happens when we do? \n\nThe release of this project aims to rip open some of those deeply held beliefs we have around music — what music is, how we value it, and how it’s “supposed to be” distributed. \n\nThis release is broken down into 3 sections: **The Canon, The Collectibles, and The Copies**. *To learn more about my thoughts behind this release mix, [read my previous essay](https://chaim.mirror.xyz/0SRGluR6sYweDWV0qmgF6V1wsN0BvEKsvCVOZCFX7yU).* \n\n### Here’s what’s happening:\n\n- There are 5 one-of-one *canon*ical NFTs on auction **below**\n- There are 9 NFT *collectibles* now [**available on Rarible**](https://rarible.com/chaim), which are walked through in detail below \n- There are 1000 album bundle *copies* [**now available on my online shop**](https://ko-fi.com/s/794a026bac), also walked through below \n\n### All collectors of any of the above will receive: \n\n- a private download of the *Textures Of A Long Forgotten Assumptions* album's songs and artwork\n- one (1) invitation into the *Homemade Universe* discord server — my private online community. \n- one (1) entry into the *Flavors Feature Contest*.

There is also a one-of-one Zora NFT for the official *Form* music video, auctioning off on Zora. \n\nYou can see who the recipients are for each of the 4 Catalog NFTs being auctioned below. These are the collaborators (writers, producers, engineers) I created this music with. \n\n## Track No. 3 — Sand\n\n*Sand* is written by Danny Majic + myself, and produced by Danny Majic.\n\nThis was the first song Danny and I ever wrote together, the very day we met each other. This was also the very first song I wrote after a 10-day cross-country solo drive from Montreal, Canada to Los Angeles, California. \n\n[Token #3166](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3166)\n\n## Track No. 4 — Red Balloons\n\n*Red Balloons* is written by Hayley Gene Penner, Jason Yik Nam Wu + myself, and produced by Rabitt.\n\nThis is the first song I've ever released with a co-written top-line. I've always found it difficult to write lyrics and melody with others, but Hayley is a great friend and we truly found a shared energy on this one. And Rabitt always brings the goods. \n\n[Token #3167](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3167)\n\n## Track No. 5 — Crazy\n\n*Crazy* is written by Danny Majic + myself, and produced by Danny Majic.\n\nWe wrote this song together at a songwriting camp in Nashville, Tennessee.

Attached to said studio was the very house we were both living in at the time. This was the last song we wrote together, before I left for Montreal when the pandemic began. A version of the song was first released on streaming platforms in May 2020, on a charity album raising money for MusiCares' Covid Relief Fund. \n\n[Token #3169](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3169)\n\nAs you can see in the auctions above above, **5% of funds received are going towards my private community *Homemade Universe*’s shared treasury**.

This means that 100 people will together own 10% of the song’s final master.**\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\n# THE COPIES\n\nThe final form this album is being released today is with **1000 album bundle copies**, [available for purchase on my online shop here](https://ko-fi.com/s/794a026bac). \n\nThis bundle comes with:\n1. the first 7 tracks off the album, including *Flavors* with the empty second verse\n2. 8 pieces of album artwork\n3. one (1) invitation to *Homemade Universe*\n4. one (1) entry into the *Flavors Feature Contest* (more info in the Collectibles section above\n\nAfter your purchase, you will receive an access card into the Homemade Universe discord — which will give you access to the private set of channels available to members. \n\nThe album bundle will be available for up to two weeks or up to 1000 copies, whichever comes first. \n\n**You can [purchase an album bundle copy here](https://ko-fi.com/s/794a026bac).**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f29b829a-3e2e-4aba-aee9-2ab41f399355.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\n# A Final Thought \n\nIn building this release out, I realized I missed one more word in my cute little alliteration. \n\nThe full phrase should go → Canon, Collectibles, Copies, and *Community*. \n\nThis project in some ways only *begins* today, in that it is the first page in our story of exploring collective creation together. For the final 3 songs, we will begin a new journey of seeing what it is like for a community to create together in 3 very different ways — one as a contest, one as a 1-to-1 relationship, and 1 as a DAO making decisions together. It is also the beginning of exploring the possibilities around sharing in the equity of our co-creations in this way. \n\nThe other thing you may notice in the splits delineated in the *Canon* NFTs above, is my private community Homemade Universe is receiving 5% of all auction revenues. Those funds will go into a shared treasury controlled by the community, which we will use for future co-creative projects together. \n\nI’m incredibly excited to go on this new journey with you. And learn what it means to bring together like-minded individuals around my art, and create real value together. \n\nThis is just the beginning. \n\nThanks for being here. 🌻", "timestamp": 1621874660, "digest": "9EAsxtkQD6hIQJLDID5w8Jn6o_m9Bw4XnDdTwOVHttA", "contributor": "0x5090c4Fead5Be112b643BC75d61bF42339675448"}

{"id": "LlpEs39G7OCzoR3svKaWrcyZ4DuzZ2Csfuo5N3NJkhM", "title": "$IMPOSSIBLE: \"Conversations on AI\"", "body": "We're super excited to launch the crowdfund for Impossible Object's first book, *Conversations on AI*.\n\nIf you'd like to back this project, all you need is an Ethereum address and to click on the crowdfund block below. Instructions about both can be found later in this post.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6391a341-d325-447b-9f6c-f240928c8dcc.png?height=500&width=704)\n\n## What's Impossible Object?\n\nImpossible Object's books will exist at the intersection of crypto and legacy publishing. This means we'll be publishing innovative books the old-fashioned way, as trade paperbacks and eBooks. But we're also attempting something completely new: simultaneously releasing on the blockchain so that we can use crypto's capacities to help make new kinds of book.\n\n*Conversations on AI* will be the first result of this experiment. Crypto has already provided solutions for crowdfunding [fiction](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), [science](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/41443491289334730858714141368268395642829177615924976808738423867555824271361) and [music](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM); now it's philosophy's turn. Backers of $IMPOSSIBLE will see the first ever philosophy book funded by crypto brought into the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3d1d3f6a-456e-48cd-8b79-5d1140227771.jpg?height=2728&width=2728)\n\n## Who's taking part in the conversations – and why are they about AI?\n\nThe initial impetus for the project was to assemble a group of pioneering thinkers so they could discuss a topic that all of their work has a stake in, and publish their discussions as a public good.\n\nThat group ended up comprising **Reza Negarestani, Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester and Nick Srnicek**. And the topic that turned out to unite their interests was Artificial Intelligence. \n\nThese thinkers have previously dealt with AI from various angles: some have written about AI directly (Reza Negarestani's *Intelligence and Spirit* and Nick Srnicek's work on the political economy of AI), some engage with AI as a collaborator (Holly Herndon, Mat Dryhurst and SPAWN), while some have developed the notion of artificiality in itself as a means out of conceptual deadlock (Helen Hester and Benjamin Bratton).\n\nIn the three conversations on the topic, AI will act more as a crossroads than the sole focus. Our dialogists are fascinated by the impact that AI will have on politics, art, philosophy, education, terraforming, and many more things, meaning that although the dialogues may consistently pass through AI, they will almost certainly end up at surprising destinations.\n\nReza's short essay on the themes of *Conversations on AI* can be found [here](https://r.mirror.xyz/zghnOjS2aVlowlZ5D7ocnswHVSLSe04ZG-ubaMFBHmI).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3650eb7b-b2d7-405a-833e-e96ab8ae0adc.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Reza Negarestani** is a philosopher and a former systems engineer. Since the early 2000s, he has contributed extensively to journals and anthologies, and lectured at numerous international universities and institutes including Duke University, MIT, École Normale Supérieure, and Haus der Kulturen der Welt among others. Negarestani’s writings have been translated to twelve languages. Negarestani’s latest philosophical work is *Intelligence and Spirit*(Urbanomic/Sequence Press/MIT, 2018), a book investigating the meaning of intelligence at the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, theory of computation and the philosophy of German Idealism.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/36c1d3cb-b3d1-4273-85f4-ece4dbedcd0c.png?height=700&width=500)\n\n**Benjamin Bratton's** work spans Philosophy, Art, Design and Computer Science. He is Professor of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego. He is Program Director of The Terraforming programme at Strelka Institute of Media, Architecture and Design in Moscow. He is also a Visiting Professor at The European Graduate School,  SCI_Arc (The Southern California Institute of Architecture) and NYU Shanghai. He is the author of several books including *The Revenge of The Real: Politics for a Post-Pandemic World *(Verso, 2021) and *The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty*  (MIT Press, 2015).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5cb5a2e-846b-429c-b790-33688ae2084f.png?height=400&width=650)\n\n**Mathew Dryhurst** is an artist and researcher based in Berlin, Germany. His research focuses on technical and ethical protocols. He makes music and creates art with Holly Herndon, and their albums *Proto* and *Platform* (4AD) have provoked international critical acclaim. He teaches at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, Strelka Institute and European Graduate School. He previously served as Director of Programming at Gray Area in San Francisco.\n\n**Holly Herndon** is an American composer, musician, and sound artist based in Berlin, Germany. After studying composition at Stanford University and completing her Ph.D. at Stanford University’s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics, she pursued a music career internationally. Herndon's music often includes human singing voices (including her own), is primarily computer-based, and regularly uses the visual programming language Max/MSP to create custom instruments and vocal processes.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d282a589-ee4b-4fc1-8a3f-5591651e2b5b.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Helen Hester** is Professor of Gender, Technology and Work at the University of West London. Her research interests include technology, social reproduction, and the future of work, and she is a member of the international feminist working group Laboria Cuboniks. Her books include *Beyond Explicit: Pornography and the Displacement of Sex* (SUNY Press, 2014), *Xenofeminism* (Polity, 2018), and *After Work: The Politics of Free Time* (Verso, 2022, with Nick Srnicek).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/088cd853-c10f-45b6-a521-c961f6b87d21.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n\n**Nick Srnicek** is a Lecturer in Digital Economy at King's College London. He is the author of *Platform Capitalism* (Polity, 2016), *Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work* (Verso, 2015 with Alex Williams).\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a9e8862-0cd7-4c28-a3d4-4a6e5ec3564a.png?height=511&width=664)\n\n\n\n## What's $IMPOSSIBLE?\n\n$IMPOSSIBLE is the token that backers of the crowdfund will receive in return for their contributions of ether. \n\nIf you're already familiar with Mirror crowdfunds and how they differ from regular crowdfunds, that won't need any explanation. But if you're new here, here's a lil explainer:\n\n- Holding $IMPOSSIBLE tokens not only proves you helped make the book happen in the first place, but also gives you a stake in the financial success of the book.\n- Once the book is completed, the text will be minted as an NFT on Zora and put up for a reserve auction.\n\n- When the NFT sells, its smart contract funnels funds back to $IMPOSSIBLE holders in proportion to the amount of $IMPOSSIBLE they hold.\n\n-  At that point, backers can choose to sell their $IMPOSSIBLE tokens on an exchange such as Uniswap, redeeming them for ether, or carry on holding them. Holders will receive financial upside whenever the NFT is auctioned again in the future.\n\n- $IMPOSSIBLE holders will be able to play a governance role by taking part in Snapshot polls relating to *Conversations on AI*.\n\n- That's not all. Hold on for a full explanation of additional benefits below.\n\n[Diagram of how it works?]\n\n## When will the conversations happen?\n\nAs soon as the crowdfund is over. \n\nAfter that, the publication of the book will occur in two stages.\n\n### Stage 1\n\nOnce the conversations have all taken place, they'll be published on Mirror as an eBook of approximately 50000 words – equivalent to about 200 printed pages. This will be free for all to read.\n\n### Stage 2\n\nThis is where things really start to get interesting. \n\nBefore the trade paperback is published, Impossible Object will seek responses to the dialogues from their first readership. The call for proposed responses will be open to **all** readers, not just holders of $IMPOSSIBLE. One to three of these will be published alongside the main dialogues in the first full print and electronic edition of the book. \n\nAlso, the names of the original backers and holders of the $IMPOSSIBLE token will be included the acknowledgements and logged forever on the blockchain in recognition of the role they played in making the book happen.\n\nPrinting commentaries and objections alongside the main text has a long tradition, stretching back before Descartes' *Meditations*. But with Mirror's help we're giving things a web3 twist.\n\n\n\n![Still from Metahaven's \"The Sprawl\"](https://thefader-res.cloudinary.com/private_images/w_1800,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:best/screen_shot_2016-04-20_at_21.52.37_rqwpvi/screenshot-from-i-the-sprawl-i.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Who will design the book?\nWe're excited to say that editorial design for the book and for Impossible Object's future titles will be by the incredible **Metahaven**.\n\nThe work of Metahaven consists of filmmaking, writing, and design. Films by Metahaven include *The Sprawl (Propaganda about Propaganda)* (2015), *Information Skies* (2016, nominated for the 2017 European Film Awards), *Hometown* (2018), *Eurasia (Questions on Happiness)* (2018), and *Chaos Theory* (2021). Solo exhibitions include *Turnarounds*, e-flux, New York (2019), *Version History*, ICA London (2018), *Earth*, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (2018), *Hometown*, Izolyatsia, Kyiv (2018), *Information Skies*, Auto Italia, London (2016), *The Sprawl*, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco (2015), and *Islands in the Cloud*, MoMA PS1, New York (2013). Recent publications include *PSYOP: An Anthology* (Koenig Books, London, 2018), and *Digital Tarkovsky* (Strelka Press, Moscow, 2018). \n\nNot only will Metahaven be doing editorial design for *Conversations on AI*; in line with a plan that will be repeated with future Impossible Object titles, the front cover image will be minted as a standalone NFT and auctioned a little further down the line. \n\nSome of the proceeds of this will go to iODAO, Impossible Object's creator DAO.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1464387a-458e-4d20-b694-34e576c840a0.png?height=409&width=430)\n\n\n\n## How much are you aiming to raise?\n\nWe're aiming to raise up to 25 ether. This will go to:\n\n- Our dialogists: Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester, Reza Negarestani and Nick Srnicek\n- Our designer, Metahaven\n- The costs of producing, marketing and distributing the book\n- The development of web3 functionality on Impossible Object's website and forthcoming Discord server, giving $IMPOSSIBLE holders access to the benefits that this entails.\n\n## What are the different tiers of backer rewards?\n\n**Every backer**\n- $IMPOSSIBLE tokens at the rate: 1 ether = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE\n- Proportional stakes in the sale of the book's NFT as described above.\n- Proportional voting power in Snapshot polls relating to the book.\n- Mention in the book's acknowledgements.\n\n**0.25 ether+**\n- The above, plus...\n- Invitation to a 2hr Zoom roundtable on AI, led by Reza Negarestani and featuring participants in the book.\n\n**0.5 ether+**\n- The above, plus...\n- Signed special edition of the book\n- Limited edition Impossible Object merch\n\n**0.75 ether+**\n- The above, plus...\n- A one-on-one call with Reza Negarestani about anything at all (not necessarily AI!).\n\n\n**1 ether+**\n- The above, plus...\n- One-of-a-kind *Conversations on AI* 'metaposter' by Metahaven.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0b9be0ef-5b18-48c2-bb36-f3f6a864d411.png?height=493&width=634)\n\n\n\n**Futher information about the crowdfund**\n\n- The crowdfund will begin at Xpm on 25th May on this page.\n- The crowdfund is first come, first serve. Once it's closed, it will no longer be possible to make contributions.\n- You will need an Ethereum wallet and some ether to participate. If you don’t have a wallet, Rainbow’s mobile app is a good option for iOS users. Alternatively, there's Metamask (iOS, Android and web).\n- 1 ether = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE. For example, someone contributing 0.5 ether will receive 500 $IMPOSSIBLE.\n- Ether transactions involve a transaction fee (Tx fee). The level of the Tx fee varies with the price of 'gas' on the network, which can be checked [here](https://ethgasstation.info/).

{"id": "D2eBXh4hsCnbDWRQxRmcqYGgp2UQr_LqCO6NZlKAbp4", "title": "Tech stack for decentralized cities", "body": "A [decentralized city](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/decentralized-cities/) is a network of **distinct physical locations tied together by shared governance and culture.** It allows people to maintain close social ties and norms while moving around to different places. It also creates resilience against local changes in climate, regulation, and social norms.\n\nInspired by Balaji's essay on [The Location Stack](https://1729.com/location/) for technological progressives and conversations at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) this past week, we've been thinking through a rough sketch of the tech stack for decentralized cities:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c9eff57a-48ee-4e01-bce5-6a71e784d038.jpeg?height=1725&width=1307)\n\nLike a computer, a decentralized city has hardware and software. **Hardware is the physical space**: the land, the infrastructure, and the buildings. **Software is the virtual layer**: incorporation, governance, and social interaction. \n\nThis separation allows decentralized cities to operate with compatible and interchangeable hardware and software architectures. If a physical node in the network doesn't agree with decisions being made, they can spin up a new virtual governance layer. And if a physical location becomes an untenable place to continue living, the community can migrate to a new location without losing its social and governance layers. \n\n**By decoupling these functions, everyone has a plausible [path to exit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty) and try something different.** You can imagine that virtual \"governments\" would gain and lose physical locations over time, and that physical locations could be part of multiple social and governance layers, depending on their needs:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/49e05c2c-07d5-44b5-9038-803cac2a07ab.png?height=1099&width=1704)\n\n\n## Hardware for a decentralized city\n\nThere are three layers of the physical hardware stack:\n\n1. Land\n2. Infrastructure\n3. Buildings\n\n### Land: Develop multiple exurban locations\n\nWhile the metaverse will increase our time spent in virtual realities, we still need to live in good old-fashioned physical reality. And if you want to be able to control your physical space, you need to own land.\n\nDecentralized cities need land, but a key difference that separates them from conventional cities is that the land doesn't all need to be in the same place. Multiple physical nodes in the network allow flexibility and a plausible path to exit from any specific location. \n\nWhere should these nodes be located? The best living locations are usually determined through quality-of-life factors like:\n\n- **Cost**: housing, food, taxes...\n- **Environment**: climate, access to nature...\n- **Infrastructure**: internet speed, airports, healthcare...\n- **Culture**: access to dining, museums, concerts...\n- **Regulation**: the ability to build, experiment...\n\n**We believe that exurban environments provide the best trade-off among these factors for decentralized cities.** They have relatively low costs and regulations and provide access to both nature and urban areas.\n\nUnincorporated areas approximately 30 minutes - 1 hour outside of core urban areas seem to be ideal. For example, we've located the first Creator Cabins location in an exurban sweet spot, out in nature but only 45 minutes from downtown Austin:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac2d734f-8a1d-4e38-9f59-c8c59639f090.jpg?height=1512&width=1926)\n\n\n### Infrastructure: Go off-grid \n\nTo build a robust decentralized city node, off-the-grid technologies make up the core infrastructure tech stack. Solar panels, fixed wireless or satellite internet, a well, and a septic system can provide for an entirely independent retreat. Here are some pictures of our infra set-up:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5085a095-c5d9-4873-b302-035da188e624.jpg?height=1333&width=1961)\n\nThere are probably several whole posts to be written about lessons learned putting in our infrastructure. But generally speaking, these technologies have gotten good enough that you can create a functioning outpost on your own infrastructure nearly anywhere in the world. With the proliferation of 5G and Starlink, internet access will soon be very fast in most places. \n\n\n### Buildings: design for community and flexibility\n\nThe physical buildings should be suited to the target citizens of your decentralized city. We recommend [A Pattern Language](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199) as a guide to the principles of spatial design of physical communities. In our case, we designed the new cabin from the ground up for creator co-living and working. It features private bedroom suites with built-in desks and large connected public areas for social interaction and collaboration: \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e626a4ec-2085-4f7c-910e-c8ee2d05120f.png?height=1708&width=2462)\n\nWe partnered with [Forte Shelter](https://www.forteshelter.com/) to pre-fabricate this cabin out of shipping containers. It's an inherently modular and extensible design. While pre-fab construction is not a panacea, **it allows the flexibility to install similar cabins anywhere in the world and move existing cabins to new locations if needed**:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11103b3b-578b-46f0-914f-4cab39355273.jpg?height=1174&width=1710)\n\nOther flexible living options like [Kibbo](https://www.kibbo.com/) could allow for even easier migration of living spaces. Chenoe Hart has written about [the ways in which self-driving technology may blur the lines between vehicles and buildings](https://reallifemag.com/perpetual-motion-machines/). \n\n\n## Software for a decentralized city\n\nDecentralized cities run on three primary layers of the software stack:\n\n1. Incorporation\n2. Governance\n3. Social\n\n### Remote incorporation\n\nIn Balaji's [Location Stack](https://1729.com/location/) post, he asks for people to help research options for jurisdictions friendly to tech progressives. Posts like [this one](https://dougantin.com/remote-work-the-tech-enabled-exit/) walk-through options for living tailored to local governance preferences. But the underlying assumption is that the place you live is also the place you will be governed. This may always be true, but it doesn't have to be. \n\nTraditionally, cities are in a single place and are incorporated locally. **But much like startups now incorporate in Delaware regardless of where they do business, cities may start to incorporate in one place and then do their work in many places.** Wyoming creating a legal structure for DAOs could make it a compelling option for incorporating a city. \n\nI am not a lawyer, and state laws aren't going anywhere. But decentralized cities with remote incorporation could actually work elegantly within the existing structures of American federalism. The idea of powers left to local governing bodies is core to the structure of the US Constitution. \n\nIf local governance isn't tied to a single location, where does it happen? On-chain.\n\n\n### On-chain governance\n\nBlockchains are a natural fit for decentralized city governance. They allow for open access, transportability, and a permanent and inalterable historical record.\n\nOne of my favorite characters of Texas history is [Angelina Eberly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Eberly), an innkeeper who protected Texas' government records with a cannon when Sam Houston (then the president of Texas) tried to forcibly relocate the state capital from Austin to his namesake town of Houston. There's a statue to honor her near the capitol in downtown Austin:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b6a9b444-019a-475e-920f-0f0c39e60ca2.jpg?height=912&width=1600)\n\nThe [Texas Archive War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Archive_War), as it was called, isn't possible when the governance records are located on a blockchain. **Anyone can look at the records at any time from anywhere, and no one can change them.**\n\nWe are experimenting with this at Creator Cabins by launching CabinDAO, [a token-based governance structure for funding and awarding creator residencies at our cabins](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/crowdfunded-creator-residencies/). Stay tuned for our $CABIN crowdfund on Mirror later this week!\n\n\n### Off-chain social communication & connection\n\nWhile Web3 provides an ideal governance layer for decentralized cities, we can borrow lessons from Web2 in developing the social layer to tie decentralized communities together.\n\nIn the 20th century, people gathered in churches that represented shared cultural, social, and religious values. We need new ways of doing this in the 21st century:\n\n> The internet era has opened us to the possibility of curating and creating our own tailored practices and to looking to our peers for guidance as much as any teacher or authority figure\n\n*[The Power of Ritual](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Ritual-Everyday-Activities-Practices/dp/0062881817), Casper ter Kuile*\n\nAs traditional religion falls by the wayside, people are developing new structures of accountability and community connection. The social layer of decentralized cities can provide these services. \n\nTools for social connection, community onboarding, reputation management, and member recruiting can all draw from existing Web2 models. However, because these tools will be owned and operated collectively by the community, they can be designed to exclusively serve the users instead of advertisers or other attention economy intermediaries. \n\n\n## A rough sketch\n\nThis post provides a rough outline of a tech stack, but take the implementation details with a grain of salt. They are our best guess from an initial exploration of the idea maze, not an ideal solution. We'd love to hear from other people thinking about building innovative living spaces and organizing social and governance structures. **After all, only through many experiments with hardware and software stacks will we start to evolve a network of nodes in the first decentralized cities.**\n\n\n\n\n*Acknowledgments: thanks to Jon Gold, Zachary Fleischmann, Lauren Alexander for feedback, edits, and ideas*\n\n", "timestamp": 1621882462, "digest": "-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

Instructions about both can be found later in this post.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6391a341-d325-447b-9f6c-f240928c8dcc.png?height=500&width=704)\n\n## What's Impossible Object?\n\nImpossible Object's books will exist at the intersection of crypto and legacy publishing. This means we'll be publishing innovative books the old-fashioned way, as trade paperbacks and eBooks. But we're also attempting something completely new: simultaneously releasing on the blockchain so that we can use crypto's capacities to help make new kinds of book.\n\n*Conversations on AI* will be the first result of this experiment. Crypto has already provided solutions for crowdfunding [fiction](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), [science](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/41443491289334730858714141368268395642829177615924976808738423867555824271361) and [music](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM); now it's philosophy's turn. Backers of $IMPOSSIBLE will see the first ever philosophy book funded by crypto brought into the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3d1d3f6a-456e-48cd-8b79-5d1140227771.jpg?height=2728&width=2728)\n\n## Who's taking part in the conversations – and why are they about AI?\n\nThe initial impetus for the project was to assemble a group of pioneering thinkers so they could discuss a topic that all of their work has a stake in, and publish their discussions as a public good.\n\nThat group ended up comprising **Reza Negarestani, Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester and Nick Srnicek**. And the topic that turned out to unite their interests was Artificial Intelligence. \n\nThese thinkers have previously dealt with AI from various angles: some have written about AI directly (Reza Negarestani's *Intelligence and Spirit* and Nick Srnicek's work on the political economy of AI), some engage with AI as a collaborator (Holly Herndon, Mat Dryhurst and SPAWN), while some have developed the notion of artificiality in itself as a means out of conceptual deadlock (Helen Hester and Benjamin Bratton).\n\nIn the three conversations on the topic, AI will act more as a crossroads than the sole focus. Our dialogists are fascinated by the impact that AI will have on politics, art, philosophy, education, terraforming, and many more things, meaning that although the dialogues may consistently pass through AI, they will almost certainly end up at surprising destinations.\n\nReza's short essay on the themes of *Conversations on AI* can be found [here](https://r.mirror.xyz/zghnOjS2aVlowlZ5D7ocnswHVSLSe04ZG-ubaMFBHmI).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3650eb7b-b2d7-405a-833e-e96ab8ae0adc.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Reza Negarestani** is a philosopher and a former systems engineer. Since the early 2000s, he has contributed extensively to journals and anthologies, and lectured at numerous international universities and institutes including Duke University, MIT, École Normale Supérieure, and Haus der Kulturen der Welt among others. Negarestani’s writings have been translated to twelve languages. Negarestani’s latest philosophical work is *Intelligence and Spirit*(Urbanomic/Sequence Press/MIT, 2018), a book investigating the meaning of intelligence at the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, theory of computation and the philosophy of German Idealism.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/36c1d3cb-b3d1-4273-85f4-ece4dbedcd0c.png?height=700&width=500)\n\n**Benjamin Bratton's** work spans Philosophy, Art, Design and Computer Science. He is Professor of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego. He is Program Director of The Terraforming programme at Strelka Institute of Media, Architecture and Design in Moscow. He is also a Visiting Professor at The European Graduate School,  SCI_Arc (The Southern California Institute of Architecture) and NYU Shanghai. He is the author of several books including *The Revenge of The Real: Politics for a Post-Pandemic World *(Verso, 2021) and *The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty*  (MIT Press, 2015).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5cb5a2e-846b-429c-b790-33688ae2084f.png?height=400&width=650)\n\n**Mathew Dryhurst** is an artist and researcher based in Berlin, Germany. His research focuses on technical and ethical protocols. He makes music and creates art with Holly Herndon, and their albums *Proto* and *Platform* (4AD) have provoked international critical acclaim. He teaches at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, Strelka Institute and European Graduate School. He previously served as Director of Programming at Gray Area in San Francisco.\n\n**Holly Herndon** is an American composer, musician, and sound artist based in Berlin, Germany. After studying composition at Stanford University and completing her Ph.D. at Stanford University’s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics, she pursued a music career internationally.

But if you're new here, here's a lil explainer:\n\n- Holding $IMPOSSIBLE tokens not only proves you helped make the book happen in the first place, but also gives you a stake in the financial success of the book.\n- Once the book is completed, the text will be minted as an NFT on Zora and put up for a reserve auction.\n\n- When the NFT sells, its smart contract funnels funds back to $IMPOSSIBLE holders in proportion to the amount of $IMPOSSIBLE they hold.\n\n-  At that point, backers can choose to sell their $IMPOSSIBLE tokens on an exchange such as Uniswap, redeeming them for ether, or carry on holding them. Holders will receive financial upside whenever the NFT is auctioned again in the future.\n\n- $IMPOSSIBLE holders will be able to play a governance role by taking part in Snapshot polls relating to *Conversations on AI*.\n\n- That's not all. Hold on for a full explanation of additional benefits below.\n\n[Diagram of how it works?]\n\n## When will the conversations happen?\n\nAs soon as the crowdfund is over. \n\nAfter that, the publication of the book will occur in two stages.\n\n### Stage 1\n\nOnce the conversations have all taken place, they'll be published on Mirror as an eBook of approximately 50000 words – equivalent to about 200 printed pages. This will be free for all to read.\n\n### Stage 2\n\nThis is where things really start to get interesting. \n\nBefore the trade paperback is published, Impossible Object will seek responses to the dialogues from their first readership. The call for proposed responses will be open to **all** readers, not just holders of $IMPOSSIBLE. One to three of these will be published alongside the main dialogues in the first full print and electronic edition of the book. \n\nAlso, the names of the original backers and holders of the $IMPOSSIBLE token will be included the acknowledgements and logged forever on the blockchain in recognition of the role they played in making the book happen.\n\nPrinting commentaries and objections alongside the main text has a long tradition, stretching back before Descartes' *Meditations*.

This means we'll be publishing innovative books the old-fashioned way, as trade paperbacks and eBooks. But we're also attempting something completely new: simultaneously releasing on the blockchain so that we can use crypto's capacities to help make new kinds of book.\n\n*Conversations on AI* will be the first result of this experiment. Crypto has already provided solutions for crowdfunding [fiction](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), [science](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/41443491289334730858714141368268395642829177615924976808738423867555824271361) and [music](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM); now it's philosophy's turn.

And the topic that turned out to unite their interests was Artificial Intelligence. \n\nThese thinkers have previously dealt with AI from various angles: some have written about AI directly (Reza Negarestani's *Intelligence and Spirit* and Nick Srnicek's work on the political economy of AI), some engage with AI as a collaborator (Holly Herndon, Mat Dryhurst and SPAWN), while some have developed the notion of artificiality in itself as a means out of conceptual deadlock (Helen Hester and Benjamin Bratton).\n\nIn the three conversations on the topic, AI will act more as a crossroads than the sole focus. Our dialogists are fascinated by the impact that AI will have on politics, art, philosophy, education, terraforming, and many more things, meaning that although the dialogues may consistently pass through AI, they will almost certainly end up at surprising destinations.\n\nReza's short essay on the themes of *Conversations on AI* can be found [here](https://r.mirror.xyz/zghnOjS2aVlowlZ5D7ocnswHVSLSe04ZG-ubaMFBHmI).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3650eb7b-b2d7-405a-833e-e96ab8ae0adc.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Reza Negarestani** is a philosopher and a former systems engineer. Since the early 2000s, he has contributed extensively to journals and anthologies, and lectured at numerous international universities and institutes including Duke University, MIT, École Normale Supérieure, and Haus der Kulturen der Welt among others. Negarestani’s writings have been translated to twelve languages. Negarestani’s latest philosophical work is *Intelligence and Spirit*(Urbanomic/Sequence Press/MIT, 2018), a book investigating the meaning of intelligence at the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, theory of computation and the philosophy of German Idealism.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/36c1d3cb-b3d1-4273-85f4-ece4dbedcd0c.png?height=700&width=500)\n\n**Benjamin Bratton's** work spans Philosophy, Art, Design and Computer Science. He is Professor of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego. He is Program Director of The Terraforming programme at Strelka Institute of Media, Architecture and Design in Moscow. He is also a Visiting Professor at The European Graduate School,  SCI_Arc (The Southern California Institute of Architecture) and NYU Shanghai.

His research focuses on technical and ethical protocols. He makes music and creates art with Holly Herndon, and their albums *Proto* and *Platform* (4AD) have provoked international critical acclaim. He teaches at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, Strelka Institute and European Graduate School. He previously served as Director of Programming at Gray Area in San Francisco.\n\n**Holly Herndon** is an American composer, musician, and sound artist based in Berlin, Germany. After studying composition at Stanford University and completing her Ph.D. at Stanford University’s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics, she pursued a music career internationally.

{"id": "PY2JcDcaQWGdl0wV9DRusAmEkfL-ZlXxuUEC3U2PKMI", "title": "Tech stack for decentralized cities", "body": "A [decentralized city](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/decentralized-cities/) is a network of **distinct physical locations tied together by shared governance and culture.** It allows people to maintain close social ties and norms while moving around to different places. It also creates resilience against local changes in climate, regulation, and society.\n\nInspired by Balaji's essay on [The Location Stack](https://1729.com/location/) for technological progressives and conversations at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) this past week, we've been thinking through a rough sketch of the tech stack for decentralized cities:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c9eff57a-48ee-4e01-bce5-6a71e784d038.jpeg?height=1725&width=1307)\n\nLike a computer, a decentralized city has hardware and software. **Hardware is the physical space**: the land, the infrastructure, and the buildings. **Software is the virtual layer**: incorporation, governance, and social interaction. \n\nThis separation can allow decentralized cities to operate with compatible and interchangeable hardware and software architectures. If a local node in the network doesn't agree with decisions being made, they can spin up a new virtual governance layer. And if a physical location becomes an untenable place to continue living, the community can migrate to a new location without losing its governance and community. \n\n**By decoupling these functions, everyone has a plausible [path to exit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty) to try something different.** You can imagine that virtual \"governments\" would gain and lose physical locations over time, and that physical locations could be part of multiple social and governance layers, depending on their needs:\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/49e05c2c-07d5-44b5-9038-803cac2a07ab.png?height=1099&width=1704)\n\n\n## Hardware for a decentralized city\n\nThere are three layers of the physical hardware stack:\n\n1. Land\n2. Infrastructure\n3. Buildings\n\n### Land: Develop multiple exurban locations\n\nWhile the metaverse will increase our time spent in virtual realities, we still need to live in good old-fashioned physical reality. And if you want to be able to control your physical space, you need to own land.\n\nDecentralized cities need land, but a key difference that separates them from conventional cities is that the land doesn't all need to be in the same place. Multiple physical nodes in the network allow flexibility and a plausible path to exit from any specific location. \n\nWhere should these nodes be located? The best living locations are usually determined through quality-of-life factors like:\n\n- *Cost*: housing, food, taxes...\n- *Environment*: climate, access to nature...\n- *Infrastructure*: internet speed, airports, healthcare...\n- *Culture*: access to dining, museums, concerts...\n- *Regulation*: the ability to build, experiment...\n\n**We think that exurban environments provide the best trade-off among these factors for the first decentralized cities.** They have relatively low costs and regulations and provide access to both nature and urban areas.\n\nUnincorporated areas approximately 30 minutes - 1 hour outside of core urban areas seem to be ideal. For example, we've located the first Creator Cabins location in an exurban sweet spot, out in nature but only 45 minutes from downtown Austin:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac2d734f-8a1d-4e38-9f59-c8c59639f090.jpg?height=1512&width=1926)\n\n\n### Infrastructure: Go off-grid \n\nTo build a robust decentralized city node, off-the-grid technologies make up the core of our infrastructure tech stack. Solar panels, fixed wireless or satellite internet, a well, and a septic system can provide for an entirely independent retreat. Here are some pictures of our infra set-up:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5085a095-c5d9-4873-b302-035da188e624.jpg?height=1333&width=1961)\n\nThere are probably several whole posts to be written about lessons learned putting in our infrastructure.

While the DAO will ultimately govern the use of the funds, here's a rough sketch of how we are thinking about structuring the program:\n\n## CabinDAO\n\nWe want to crowdfund 12 months worth of time at the cabins. This would allow $CABIN holders to vote and fund 12 creators to come for a one-month stay each. The cabins in Texas have four bedrooms, so we would run three cohorts of four creators each.\n\nThe DAO will set up an open application process (perhaps similar to $WRITE RACE), and the winners will be invited to Creator Cabins outside of Austin, TX to work on their proposals. At the end of the month, we will help each creator mint an NFT representing their residency. The NFTs could be held and curated by the CabinDAO treasury or sold back to the community with a split of the proceeds going to the artist and the DAO.\n\nThis project came together over the course of a two-week stay at Creator Cabins by members of Creator Coop. We didn't go into our stay intending to make this—the plan emerged from two weeks of co-working, co-living, and co-creating at the cabins. Everyone came into their time at the cabins with projects they wanted to finish, but late night conversations around the fire got us all inspired to build something much bigger.  We hope this residency program can help inspire more collaborative projects like this one.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2c1549c9-0d03-4b4e-914c-d50f07800d22.jpg?height=1284&width=1932)\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\nWho is eligible for a residency?\nAnyone creating independently and sharing their work online.

All contributors will be awarded $CABIN tokens, which can be used to vote for creator residency proposals. While the DAO will ultimately govern the use of the funds, here's a rough sketch of how we are thinking about structuring the program:\n\n## CabinDAO\n\nWe want to crowdfund 12 months' worth of time at the cabins. This would allow $CABIN holders to vote and fund 12 creators to come for a one-month stay each. The new cabin has four bedrooms, so we would run three cohorts of four creators each.\n\nThe DAO will set up an open application process (perhaps similar to $WRITE RACE), and the winners will be invited to Creator Cabins outside of Austin, TX to work on their proposals. At the end of the month, we will help each creator mint an NFT representing their residency. The NFTs could be held and curated by the CabinDAO treasury or sold back to the community with a split of the proceeds going to the artist and the DAO.\n\nThis project came together over the course of a two-week stay at Creator Cabins by members of [creator.coop](https://creator.coop). We didn't go into our stay intending to make this——the plan emerged from two weeks of co-working, co-living, and co-creating at the cabins. Everyone came into their time at the cabins with projects they wanted to finish, but late-night conversations around the fire got us all inspired to build something much bigger.  We hope this residency program can help inspire more collaborative projects like this one.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2c1549c9-0d03-4b4e-914c-d50f07800d22.jpg?height=1284&width=1932)\n\n\n\n## FAQs\n\n### Who is eligible for a residency?\n\nAnyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of the term “creator”: digital artists, musicians, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders. If you’re building something that you hope to share back with the world, then you probably fit the bill. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of Web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide.\n\n\n### How do I apply? \n\nOnce the crowdfund is complete, the DAO will run an open process for selecting applicants. [If you're interested in being notified about that process, opt-in here](https://creatorcabins.ck.page/9e628caec5).\n\n\n### How will the money be spent?\n\nAll money raised by the DAO will be used to fund residencies at Creator Cabins. We are budgeting 1/3rd of an ETH per creator-week, so 16 ETH can fund 3 cohorts (12 creators for a total of 48 weeks at the cabins). \n \n\n### What happens with the other 50% of $CABIN?\n\nThe DAO will retain 50% of $CABIN tokens to give to artists upon completion of their residencies, future supporters of the residency program, and whoever else CabinDAO decides to grant them to.\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1df7adbe-3a5c-49e0-95f2-d9af9e8c364e.jpg?height=1298&width=1946)\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/27723c84-ba7e-4cf2-b133-6b843455ecd1.jpg?height=1284&width=1950)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2a3ce5da-5f6d-4ce6-974a-83006b9ddcd4.jpg?height=1308&width=1960)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/39edd82a-9a14-4f91-9442-79e59c11eb5b.jpg?height=1292&width=1940)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8aca6bb-3fd6-457a-987e-c606089a5907.jpg?height=1254&width=1932)\n\n", "timestamp": 1621914333, "digest": "bq669jDh2Rra9sE0qhYv0zYrn-rZRvtGJM1mspQ3Ok8", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

Instructions about both can be found later in this post.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6391a341-d325-447b-9f6c-f240928c8dcc.png?height=500&width=704)\n\n## What's Impossible Object?\n\nImpossible Object's books will exist at the intersection of crypto and legacy publishing. This means we'll be publishing innovative books the old-fashioned way, as trade paperbacks and eBooks. But we're also attempting something completely new: simultaneously releasing on the blockchain so that we can use crypto's capacities to help make new kinds of book.\n\n*Conversations on AI* will be the first result of this experiment. Crypto has already provided solutions for crowdfunding [fiction](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), [science](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/41443491289334730858714141368268395642829177615924976808738423867555824271361) and [music](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM); now it's philosophy's turn. Backers of $IMPOSSIBLE will see the first ever philosophy book funded by crypto brought into the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3d1d3f6a-456e-48cd-8b79-5d1140227771.jpg?height=2728&width=2728)\n\n## Who's taking part in the conversations – and why are they about AI?\n\nThe initial impetus for the project was to assemble a group of pioneering thinkers so they could discuss a topic that all of their work has a stake in, and publish their discussions as a public good.\n\nThat group ended up comprising **Reza Negarestani, Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester and Nick Srnicek**. And the topic that turned out to unite their interests was Artificial Intelligence. \n\nThese thinkers have previously dealt with AI from various angles: some have written about AI directly (Reza Negarestani's *Intelligence and Spirit* and Nick Srnicek's work on the political economy of AI), some engage with AI as a collaborator (Holly Herndon, Mat Dryhurst and SPAWN), while some have developed the notion of artificiality in itself as a means out of conceptual deadlock (Helen Hester and Benjamin Bratton).\n\nIn the three conversations on the topic, AI will act more as a crossroads than the sole focus. Our dialogists are fascinated by the impact that AI will have on politics, art, philosophy, education, terraforming, and many more things, meaning that although the dialogues may consistently pass through AI, they will almost certainly end up at surprising destinations.\n\nReza's short essay on the themes of *Conversations on AI* can be found [here](https://r.mirror.xyz/zghnOjS2aVlowlZ5D7ocnswHVSLSe04ZG-ubaMFBHmI).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3650eb7b-b2d7-405a-833e-e96ab8ae0adc.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Reza Negarestani** is a philosopher and a former systems engineer. Since the early 2000s, he has contributed extensively to journals and anthologies, and lectured at numerous international universities and institutes including Duke University, MIT, École Normale Supérieure, and Haus der Kulturen der Welt among others. Negarestani’s writings have been translated to twelve languages. Negarestani’s latest philosophical work is *Intelligence and Spirit*(Urbanomic/Sequence Press/MIT, 2018), a book investigating the meaning of intelligence at the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, theory of computation and the philosophy of German Idealism.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/36c1d3cb-b3d1-4273-85f4-ece4dbedcd0c.png?height=700&width=500)\n\n**Benjamin Bratton's** work spans Philosophy, Art, Design and Computer Science. He is Professor of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego. He is Program Director of The Terraforming programme at Strelka Institute of Media, Architecture and Design in Moscow. He is also a Visiting Professor at The European Graduate School,  SCI_Arc (The Southern California Institute of Architecture) and NYU Shanghai. He is the author of several books including *The Revenge of The Real: Politics for a Post-Pandemic World *(Verso, 2021) and *The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty*  (MIT Press, 2015).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5cb5a2e-846b-429c-b790-33688ae2084f.png?height=400&width=650)\n\n**Holly Herndon** operates at the edge of electronic and avant-garde pop music and emerges with a dynamic and disruptive canon of her own. On her most recent full-length album *PROTO* Herndon fronts and conducts an electronic pop choir comprised of both human and AI voices over a musical palette that encompasses everything from synths to Sacred Harp stylings. CNN noted that Herndon is “shaping the future of AI” and she has demonstrated this nexus of technological evolution and musical catharsis with elevated performances at The Barbican (London), Volksbühne (Berlin), Sónar (Barcelona), Unsound (Krakow), and Club 2 Club (Milan). The sounds synthesized on PROTO by Herndon, her AI “baby” Spawn, and the vocal ensemble combine elements from Herndon’s dynamic and idiosyncratic personal journey: the timeless folk traditions of her childhood experiences in church-going East Tennessee (particularly the prismatic layered practice of Sacred Harp singing), the avant-garde music she explored while at Mills College, and the radical club culture of Berlin, all enhanced by her recent PhD composition studies at Stanford University, researching machine learning and music. Herndon co-founded the podcast series Interdependence alongside Mat Dryhurst.\n\n**Mat Dryhurst** releases music, research and artworks solo and in conjunction with creative partner Holly Herndon. He teaches at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Music, Strelka Institute and the European Graduate School and hosts discussions with figures shaping 21st century culture on the Interdependence podcast.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d282a589-ee4b-4fc1-8a3f-5591651e2b5b.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Helen Hester** is Professor of Gender, Technology and Work at the University of West London. Her research interests include technology, social reproduction, and the future of work, and she is a member of the international feminist working group Laboria Cuboniks. Her books include *Beyond Explicit: Pornography and the Displacement of Sex* (SUNY Press, 2014), *Xenofeminism* (Polity, 2018), and *After Work: The Politics of Free Time* (Verso, 2022, with Nick Srnicek).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/088cd853-c10f-45b6-a521-c961f6b87d21.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n\n**Nick Srnicek** is a Lecturer in Digital Economy at King's College London. He is the author of *Platform Capitalism* (Polity, 2016), *Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work* (Verso, 2015 with Alex Williams).\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a9e8862-0cd7-4c28-a3d4-4a6e5ec3564a.png?height=511&width=664)\n\n\n\n## What's $IMPOSSIBLE?\n\n$IMPOSSIBLE is the token that backers of the crowdfund will receive in return for their contributions of ether. \n\nIf you're already familiar with Mirror crowdfunds and how they differ from regular crowdfunds, that won't need any explanation.

They demand us to navigate them across different scales, to see and approach them not as monolithic phenomena but as deep objects which progressively push us to engineer better toolboxes of techniques to interact with them. The concept of intelligence invokes precisely one such complex landscape whose navigation calls at once for attempts at refinement, conceptual perspicuity and open-endedness, care and development of new ways of knowing and practice.\n\nCharles and Ray Eames’ classic short film *Powers of Ten* begins with a couple enjoying a picnic. This is what we can call the familiar picture of things broadly understood. Thus, the initial point of the story takes place at a scale we are already inhabiting in our ordinary and quotidian picture of the world. We can call this the scale zero of any terrestrial story.\n\nThe film then scales up this familiar picture every ten seconds, from one square meter to ten square meters, then one hundred and then one thousand, until it reaches 100 million light years. By this simple procedure of adding a zero to our index of scale-length every ten seconds, we soon find ourselves at the brink of an empty universe littered with scanty piles of dust that we call galaxies. \n\nThe film then reverses direction and hurtles back towards the couples at the Michigan lakeside. This time we scale down from a patch of the man’s skin to the scale of elementary particles and scales for which we have not yet developed robust and confirmed theories of physics. \n\n![Stills from \"Powers of Ten\". Copyright Eames Office LLC.](http://shazwanyaziz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Powers_of_Ten_Film_Stills_Final.png)\n\nThis instance of scaling up and down from the ordinary picture of ourselves to which we are accustomed to a scale where the concept of the human must be invented anew coincides with the obligation of forging new ways of looking at the meaning of our place in the world broadly understood. \n\nAs we move up and down in terms of scales, we no longer see ourselves as this or that sort of species, for our conception of ourselves as a part of the world constantly changes, a change that requires new concepts and vocabularies, new ways of knowing and worldmaking, and by extension revised theoretical and practical commitments to the word and to ourselves.\n\nThe aim of *Conversations on AI* is to pursue a series of discussions with a simple premise. We will begin by talking about artificial intelligence and general intelligence as we know them today. This is the scale zero of our dialogue. From our ordinary understanding of intelligence, we can move up and down the scales. We will assess the idea of AI and general intelligence at political and trans-generational levels as we travel higher in scales. At the same time, we’ll begin to talk about intelligence at lower scales such as neural and biochemical levels. Our commitment is to nothing but drastic shifts in perspective when it comes to talking about intelligence. \n\nSuch changes of perspective demand us to engineer new concepts — more refined, more fruitful and more robust — for the scale at which we address the problems. Conceptual engineering that replaces or repairs our everyday concepts with better ones will be a guiding principle in our exploration.\n\nAll in all, this book promises to deal with the questions of artificial intelligence and general intelligence using a host of different perspectives at different scales, from the question of modeling complex phenomena to planetary-scale engineering, education and global pedagogy, trans-generational politics to the intersection of the computational mind and the social mind.\n\nWhat happens when the social account of mind meets the computational account of mind, when we realize that we have always been artifacts of our decisions, thoughts and actions, whether directly or through the systems in which they have now been entrenched?\n\n[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0)\n\n**Reza Negarestani is a philosopher and a former systems engineer.

This means we'll be publishing innovative books the old-fashioned way, as trade paperbacks and eBooks. But we're also attempting something completely new: simultaneously releasing on the blockchain so that we can use crypto's capacities to help make new kinds of book.\n\n*Conversations on AI* will be the first result of this experiment. Crypto has already provided solutions for crowdfunding [fiction](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), [science](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/41443491289334730858714141368268395642829177615924976808738423867555824271361) and [music](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM); now it's philosophy's turn. Backers of $IMPOSSIBLE will see the first ever philosophy book funded by crypto brought into the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3d1d3f6a-456e-48cd-8b79-5d1140227771.jpg?height=2728&width=2728)\n\n## Who's taking part in the conversations – and why are they about AI?\n\nThe initial impetus for the project was to assemble a group of pioneering thinkers so they could discuss a topic that all of their work has a stake in, and publish their discussions as a public good.\n\nThat group ended up comprising **Reza Negarestani, Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester and Nick Srnicek**. And the topic that turned out to unite their interests was Artificial Intelligence. \n\nThese thinkers have previously dealt with AI from various angles: some have written about AI directly (Reza Negarestani's *Intelligence and Spirit* and Nick Srnicek's work on the political economy of AI), some engage with AI as a collaborator (Holly Herndon, Mat Dryhurst and SPAWN), while some have developed the notion of artificiality in itself as a means out of conceptual deadlock (Helen Hester and Benjamin Bratton).\n\nIn the three conversations on the topic, AI will act more as a crossroads than the sole focus. Our dialogists are fascinated by the impact that AI will have on politics, art, philosophy, education, terraforming, and many more things, meaning that although the dialogues may consistently pass through AI, they will almost certainly end up at surprising destinations.\n\nReza's short essay on the themes of *Conversations on AI* can be found [here](https://r.mirror.xyz/zghnOjS2aVlowlZ5D7ocnswHVSLSe04ZG-ubaMFBHmI).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3650eb7b-b2d7-405a-833e-e96ab8ae0adc.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Reza Negarestani** is a philosopher and a former systems engineer.

He is Professor of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego. He is Program Director of The Terraforming programme at Strelka Institute of Media, Architecture and Design in Moscow. He is also a Visiting Professor at The European Graduate School,  SCI_Arc (The Southern California Institute of Architecture) and NYU Shanghai.

On her most recent full-length album *PROTO* Herndon fronts and conducts an electronic pop choir comprised of both human and AI voices over a musical palette that encompasses everything from synths to Sacred Harp stylings. CNN noted that Herndon is “shaping the future of AI” and she has demonstrated this nexus of technological evolution and musical catharsis with elevated performances at The Barbican (London), Volksbühne (Berlin), Sónar (Barcelona), Unsound (Krakow), and Club 2 Club (Milan). The sounds synthesized on PROTO by Herndon, her AI “baby” Spawn, and the vocal ensemble combine elements from Herndon’s dynamic and idiosyncratic personal journey: the timeless folk traditions of her childhood experiences in church-going East Tennessee (particularly the prismatic layered practice of Sacred Harp singing), the avant-garde music she explored while at Mills College, and the radical club culture of Berlin, all enhanced by her recent PhD composition studies at Stanford University, researching machine learning and music. Herndon co-founded the podcast series Interdependence alongside Mat Dryhurst.\n\n**Mat Dryhurst** releases music, research and artworks solo and in conjunction with creative partner Holly Herndon. He teaches at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Music, Strelka Institute and the European Graduate School and hosts discussions with figures shaping 21st century culture on the Interdependence podcast.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d282a589-ee4b-4fc1-8a3f-5591651e2b5b.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Helen Hester** is Professor of Gender, Technology and Work at the University of West London. Her research interests include technology, social reproduction, and the future of work, and she is a member of the international feminist working group Laboria Cuboniks. Her books include *Beyond Explicit: Pornography and the Displacement of Sex* (SUNY Press, 2014), *Xenofeminism* (Polity, 2018), and *After Work: The Politics of Free Time* (Verso, 2022, with Nick Srnicek).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/088cd853-c10f-45b6-a521-c961f6b87d21.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n\n**Nick Srnicek** is a Lecturer in Digital Economy at King's College London.

Instructions about both can be found later in this post.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6391a341-d325-447b-9f6c-f240928c8dcc.png?height=500&width=704)\n\n## What's Impossible Object?\n\nImpossible Object's books will exist at the intersection of crypto and legacy publishing. This means we'll be publishing innovative books the old-fashioned way, as trade paperbacks and eBooks. But we're also attempting something completely new: simultaneously releasing on the blockchain so that we can use crypto's capacities to help make new kinds of book.\n\n*Conversations on AI* will be the first result of this experiment. Crypto has already provided solutions for crowdfunding [fiction](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), [science](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/41443491289334730858714141368268395642829177615924976808738423867555824271361) and [music](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM); now it's philosophy's turn. Backers of $IMPOSSIBLE will see the first ever philosophy book funded by crypto brought into the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3d1d3f6a-456e-48cd-8b79-5d1140227771.jpg?height=2728&width=2728)\n\n## Who's taking part in the conversations – and why are they about AI?\n\nThe initial impetus for the project was to assemble a group of pioneering thinkers so they could discuss a topic that all of their work has a stake in, and publish their discussions as a public good.\n\nThat group ended up comprising **Reza Negarestani, Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester and Nick Srnicek**. And the topic that turned out to unite their interests was Artificial Intelligence. \n\nThese thinkers have previously dealt with AI from various angles: some have written about AI directly (Reza Negarestani's *Intelligence and Spirit* and Nick Srnicek's work on the political economy of AI), some engage with AI as a collaborator (Holly Herndon, Mat Dryhurst and SPAWN), while some have developed the notion of artificiality in itself as a means out of conceptual deadlock (Helen Hester and Benjamin Bratton).\n\nIn the three conversations on the topic, AI will act more as a crossroads than the sole focus. Our dialogists are fascinated by the impact that AI will have on politics, art, philosophy, education, terraforming, and many more things, meaning that although the dialogues may consistently pass through AI, they will almost certainly end up at surprising destinations.\n\n[Insert thoughts on blockchain here. Emphasise that it's first of its kind.]\n\nReza and Impossible Object's short essay on the themes of *Conversations on AI* can be found [here](https://r.mirror.xyz/zghnOjS2aVlowlZ5D7ocnswHVSLSe04ZG-ubaMFBHmI).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3650eb7b-b2d7-405a-833e-e96ab8ae0adc.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Reza Negarestani** is a philosopher and a former systems engineer. [He became known for his pioneering work of teory-fiction...] pioneering the Since the early 2000s, he has contributed extensively to journals and anthologies, and lectured at numerous international universities and institutes including Duke University, MIT, École Normale Supérieure, and Haus der Kulturen der Welt among others. Negarestani’s writings have been translated to twelve languages. Negarestani’s latest philosophical work is *Intelligence and Spirit*(Urbanomic/Sequence Press/MIT, 2018), a book investigating the meaning of intelligence at the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, theory of computation and the philosophy of German Idealism.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/36c1d3cb-b3d1-4273-85f4-ece4dbedcd0c.png?height=700&width=500)\n\n**Benjamin Bratton's** work spans Philosophy, Art, Design and Computer Science. He is Professor of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego. He is Program Director of The Terraforming programme at Strelka Institute of Media, Architecture and Design in Moscow. He is also a Visiting Professor at The European Graduate School,  SCI_Arc (The Southern California Institute of Architecture) and NYU Shanghai. He is the author of several books including *The Revenge of The Real: Politics for a Post-Pandemic World *(Verso, 2021) and *The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty*  (MIT Press, 2015).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5cb5a2e-846b-429c-b790-33688ae2084f.png?height=400&width=650)\n\n**Holly Herndon** operates at the edge of electronic and avant-garde pop music and emerges with a dynamic and disruptive canon of her own. On her most recent full-length album *PROTO* Herndon fronts and conducts an electronic pop choir comprised of both human and AI voices over a musical palette that encompasses everything from synths to Sacred Harp stylings. CNN noted that Herndon is “shaping the future of AI” and she has demonstrated this nexus of technological evolution and musical catharsis with elevated performances at The Barbican (London), Volksbühne (Berlin), Sónar (Barcelona), Unsound (Krakow), and Club 2 Club (Milan). The sounds synthesized on PROTO by Herndon, her AI “baby” Spawn, and the vocal ensemble combine elements from Herndon’s dynamic and idiosyncratic personal journey: the timeless folk traditions of her childhood experiences in church-going East Tennessee (particularly the prismatic layered practice of Sacred Harp singing), the avant-garde music she explored while at Mills College, and the radical club culture of Berlin, all enhanced by her recent PhD composition studies at Stanford University, researching machine learning and music. Herndon co-founded the podcast series Interdependence alongside Mat Dryhurst.\n\n**Mat Dryhurst** releases music, research and artworks solo and in conjunction with creative partner Holly Herndon. He teaches at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Music, Strelka Institute and the European Graduate School and hosts discussions with figures shaping 21st century culture on the Interdependence podcast.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d282a589-ee4b-4fc1-8a3f-5591651e2b5b.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Helen Hester** is Professor of Gender, Technology and Work at the University of West London. Her research interests include technology, social reproduction, and the future of work, and she is a member of the international feminist working group Laboria Cuboniks. Her books include *Beyond Explicit: Pornography and the Displacement of Sex* (SUNY Press, 2014), *Xenofeminism* (Polity, 2018), and *After Work: The Politics of Free Time* (Verso, 2022, with Nick Srnicek).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/088cd853-c10f-45b6-a521-c961f6b87d21.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n\n**Nick Srnicek** is a Lecturer in Digital Economy at King's College London. He is the author of *Platform Capitalism* (Polity, 2016), *Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work* (Verso, 2015 with Alex Williams).\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a9e8862-0cd7-4c28-a3d4-4a6e5ec3564a.png?height=511&width=664)\n\n\n\n## What's $IMPOSSIBLE?\n\n$IMPOSSIBLE is the token that backers of the crowdfund will receive in return for their contributions of ether. \n\nIf you're already familiar with Mirror crowdfunds and how they differ from regular crowdfunds, that won't need any explanation. But if you're new here, here's a lil explainer:\n\n- Holding $IMPOSSIBLE tokens not only proves you helped make the book happen in the first place, but also gives you a stake in the financial success of the book.\n- Once the book is completed, the text will be minted as an NFT on Zora and put up for a reserve auction.\n\n- When the NFT sells, its smart contract funnels funds back to $IMPOSSIBLE holders in proportion to the amount of $IMPOSSIBLE they hold.\n\n-  At that point, backers can choose to sell their $IMPOSSIBLE tokens on an exchange such as Uniswap, redeeming them for ether, or carry on holding them. Holders will receive financial upside whenever the NFT is auctioned again in the future.\n\n- $IMPOSSIBLE holders will be able to play a governance role by taking part in Snapshot polls relating to *Conversations on AI*.\n\n- That's not all. Hold on for a full explanation of additional benefits below.\n\n[Diagram of how it works?]\n\n## When will the conversations happen?\n\nAs soon as the crowdfund is over. \n\nAfter that, the publication of the book will occur in two stages.\n\n### Stage 1\n\nOnce the conversations have all taken place, they'll be published on Mirror as a 'beta' eBook of approximately 50,000 words – equivalent to about 200 printed pages. This will be free for all to read.\n\n### Stage 2\n\nThis is where things really start to get interesting. \n\nBefore the trade paperback is published, Impossible Object will seek responses to the dialogues from their first readership. The call for proposed responses will be open to **all** readers, not just holders of $IMPOSSIBLE. One to three of these will be published alongside the main dialogues in the first full print and electronic edition of the book, and the authors will be rewarded with $IMPOSSIBLE tokens.\n\nAlso, the names of the original backers and holders of the $IMPOSSIBLE token will be included the acknowledgements and logged forever on the blockchain in recognition of the role they played in making the book happen.\n\nPrinting commentaries and objections alongside the main text has a long tradition, stretching back before Descartes' *Meditations*. But with Mirror's help we're giving things a web3 twist.\n\n\n\n![Still from Metahaven's \"The Sprawl\"](https://thefader-res.cloudinary.com/private_images/w_1800,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:best/screen_shot_2016-04-20_at_21.52.37_rqwpvi/screenshot-from-i-the-sprawl-i.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Who will design the book?\nWe're excited to say that editorial design for the book and for Impossible Object's future titles will be by the incredible **Metahaven**.\n\nThe work of Metahaven consists of filmmaking, writing, and design. Films by Metahaven include *The Sprawl (Propaganda about Propaganda)* (2015), *Information Skies* (2016, nominated for the 2017 European Film Awards), *Hometown* (2018), *Eurasia (Questions on Happiness)* (2018), and *Chaos Theory* (2021). Solo exhibitions include *Turnarounds*, e-flux, New York (2019), *Version History*, ICA London (2018), *Earth*, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (2018), *Hometown*, Izolyatsia, Kyiv (2018), *Information Skies*, Auto Italia, London (2016), *The Sprawl*, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco (2015), and *Islands in the Cloud*, MoMA PS1, New York (2013). Recent publications include *PSYOP: An Anthology* (Koenig Books, London, 2018), and *Digital Tarkovsky* (Strelka Press, Moscow, 2018). \n\nNot only will Metahaven be doing editorial design for *Conversations on AI*; in line with a plan that will be repeated with future Impossible Object titles, the front cover image will be minted as a standalone NFT and auctioned a little further down the line. \n\nSome of the proceeds of this will go to iODAO, Impossible Object's creator DAO.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1464387a-458e-4d20-b694-34e576c840a0.png?height=409&width=430)\n\n\n\n## How much are you aiming to raise?\n\nWe're aiming to raise up to 25 ether. This will go to:\n\n- Our dialogists: Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester, Reza Negarestani and Nick Srnicek\n- Our designer, Metahaven\n- The costs of producing, marketing and distributing the book\n- The development of web3 functionality on Impossible Object's website and forthcoming Discord server, giving $IMPOSSIBLE holders access to the benefits that this entails.\n\n## What are the different tiers of backer rewards?\n\n**Every backer**\n- $IMPOSSIBLE tokens at the rate: 1 ether = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE.\n- Proportional stakes in the sale of the book's NFT as described above.\n- Proportional voting power in Snapshot polls relating to the book.\n- Mention in the book's acknowledgements.\n\n**0.125 ether+**\n- The above, plus...\n- Invitation to a 2hr Zoom roundtable on AI, led by Reza Negarestani and featuring participants in the book.\n\n**0.5 ether+**\n- The above, plus...\n- Signed special edition of the book.\n- Limited edition Impossible Object merch.\n\n**0.75 ether+**\n- The above, plus...\n- One-of-a-kind *Conversations on AI* poster by Metahaven.\n\n**1 ether+**\n- The above, plus...\n- A one-on-one call with Reza Negarestani on the topics covered in *Conversations on AI*.\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0b9be0ef-5b18-48c2-bb36-f3f6a864d411.png?height=493&width=634)\n\n\n\n**Futher information about the crowdfund**\n\n- The crowdfund will begin at Xpm on 25th May on this page.\n- The crowdfund is first come, first serve. Once it's closed, it will no longer be possible to make contributions.\n- You will need an Ethereum wallet and some ether to participate. If you don’t have a wallet, Rainbow’s mobile app is a good option for iOS users. Alternatively, there's Metamask (iOS, Android and web).\n- 1 ether = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE. For example, someone contributing 0.5 ether will receive 500 $IMPOSSIBLE.\n- Ether transactions involve a transaction fee (Tx fee). The level of the Tx fee varies with the price of 'gas' on the network, which can be checked [here](https://ethgasstation.info/). If gas prices are too high, wait and try again later for a more reasonable overall Tx fee.\n- If you are new to this and need any advice, reach out on the Impossible Object [Telegram group](t.me/impossibleobject).

Copyright Eames Office LLC.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3cd2022e-2df3-41e1-8322-47717aa08c1d.jpeg?height=1046&width=1568)\n\nComplex landscapes are defined by their multi-level structures. They demand us to navigate them across different scales, to see and approach them not as monolithic phenomena but as deep objects which progressively push us to engineer better toolboxes of techniques to interact with them. The concept of intelligence invokes precisely one such complex landscape whose navigation calls at once for open-ended exploration and careful development of new ways of knowing and practice.\n\nCharles and Ray Eames’ classic short film *Powers of Ten* begins with a couple enjoying a picnic. This is what we can call the familiar picture of things broadly understood. Thus, the initial point of the story takes place at a scale we are already inhabiting in our ordinary and quotidian picture of the world. We can call this the scale zero of any terrestrial story.\n\nThe film then scales up this familiar picture every ten seconds, from one square meter to ten square meters, then one hundred and then one thousand, until it reaches 100 million light years. By this simple procedure of adding a zero to our index of scale-length every ten seconds, we soon find ourselves at the brink of an empty universe littered with scanty piles of dust that we call galaxies. \n\nThe film then reverses direction and hurtles back towards the couples at the Michigan lakeside. This time we scale down from a patch of the man’s skin to the scale of elementary particles and scales for which we have not yet developed robust and confirmed theories of physics. \n\n![Stills from \"Powers of Ten\". Copyright Eames Office LLC.](http://shazwanyaziz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Powers_of_Ten_Film_Stills_Final.png)\n\nThis instance of scaling up and down from the ordinary picture of ourselves to which we are accustomed to a scale where the concept of the human must be invented anew coincides with the obligation of forging new ways of looking at the meaning of our place in the world broadly understood. \n\nAs we move up and down in terms of scales, we no longer see ourselves as this or that sort of species, for our conception of ourselves as a part of the world constantly changes, a change that requires new concepts and vocabularies, new ways of knowing and worldmaking, and by extension revised theoretical and practical commitments to the word and to ourselves.\n\nThe aim of *Conversations on AI* is to pursue a series of discussions with a simple premise. We will begin by talking about artificial intelligence and general intelligence as we know them today. This is the scale zero of our dialogue. From our ordinary understanding of intelligence, we can move up and down the scales. We will assess the idea of AI and general intelligence at political and trans-generational levels as we travel higher in scales. At the same time, we’ll begin to talk about intelligence at lower scales such as neural and biochemical levels. Our commitment is to nothing but drastic shifts in perspective when it comes to talking about intelligence. \n\nSuch changes of perspective demand us to engineer new concepts — more refined, more fruitful and more robust — for the scale at which we address the problems. Conceptual engineering that replaces or repairs our everyday concepts with better ones will be a guiding principle in our exploration.\n\nAll in all, this book promises to deal with the questions of artificial intelligence and general intelligence using a host of different perspectives at different scales, from the question of modeling complex phenomena to planetary-scale engineering, education and global pedagogy, trans-generational politics to the intersection of the computational mind and the social mind.\n\nWhat happens when the social account of mind meets the computational account of mind, when we realize that we have always been artifacts of our decisions, thoughts and actions, whether directly or through the systems in which they have now been entrenched?\n\n**Click here to be taken back to the *Conversations on AI* crowdfund:**\n\nhttps://r.mirror.xyz/hqkBkj6ttSQfHvgdArGYPNgw9JkrlLAyZqC5UWqk3s0\n\n**Reza Negarestani is a philosopher and a former systems engineer.

We're situated on 28 acres of land about 45 minutes from downtown Austin, and we just built a new cabin designed as a collaborative co-living and working space for independent online creators. Our cabins are the first nodes in what we hope will one day be a [decentralized city](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/decentralized-cities/):\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aff070f7-1ccb-4868-8a53-64505c093fee.jpg?height=1174&width=1710)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f7f4c3a9-0d4d-4403-8a28-23432eb32a98.jpg?height=1286&width=1954)\n\n[The land & cabins are our hardware](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4).

While the DAO will ultimately govern the use of the funds, here's a rough sketch of how we are thinking about structuring the program:\n\n## CabinDAO\n\nWe want to crowdfund 12 months' worth of time at the cabins. This would allow $CABIN holders to vote and fund 12 creators to come for a one-month stay each. The new cabin has four bedrooms, so we would run three cohorts of four creators each.\n\nThe DAO will set up an open application process (perhaps similar to $WRITE RACE), and the winners will be invited to Creator Cabins outside of Austin, TX to work on their proposals. At the end of the month, we will help each creator mint an NFT representing their residency. The NFTs could be held and curated by the CabinDAO treasury or sold back to the community with a split of the proceeds going to the artist and the DAO.\n\nThis project came together over the course of a two-week stay at Creator Cabins by members of [creator.coop](https://creator.coop). We didn't go into our stay intending to make this——the plan emerged from two weeks of co-working, co-living, and co-creating at the cabins. Everyone came into their time at the cabins with projects they wanted to finish, but late-night conversations around the fire got us all inspired to build something much bigger.  We hope the residency program can help inspire more collaborative projects like this one.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2c1549c9-0d03-4b4e-914c-d50f07800d22.jpg?height=1284&width=1932)\n\n\n\n## FAQs\n\n### Who is eligible for a residency?\n\nAnyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of the term “creator”: digital artists, musicians, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders. If you’re building something that you hope to share back with the world, then you probably fit the bill.

Now we're starting to experiment with on-chain governance software. We will set up CabinDAO to manage this crowdfund. All contributors will be awarded $CABIN tokens, which can be used to vote for creator residency proposals. While the DAO will ultimately govern the use of the funds, here's a rough sketch of how we are thinking about structuring the program:\n\n## CabinDAO\n\nWe want to crowdfund 12 months' worth of time at the cabins. This would allow $CABIN holders to vote and fund 12 creators to come for a one-month stay each. The new cabin has four bedrooms, so we would run three cohorts of four creators each.\n\nThe DAO will set up an open application process (perhaps similar to $WRITE RACE), and the winners will be invited to Creator Cabins outside of Austin, TX to work on their proposals. At the end of the month, we will help each creator mint an NFT representing their residency. The NFTs could be held and curated by the CabinDAO treasury or sold back to the community with a split of the proceeds going to the artist and the DAO.\n\nThis project came together over the course of a two-week stay at Creator Cabins by members of [creator.coop](https://creator.coop). We didn't go into our stay intending to make this——the plan emerged from two weeks of co-working, co-living, and co-creating at the cabins. Everyone came into their time at the cabins with projects they wanted to finish, but late-night conversations around the fire got us all inspired to build something much bigger.  We hope the residency program can help inspire more collaborative projects like this one.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2c1549c9-0d03-4b4e-914c-d50f07800d22.jpg?height=1284&width=1932)\n\n\n\n## FAQs\n\n### Who is eligible for a residency?\n\nAnyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of the term “creator”: digital artists, musicians, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders. If you’re building something that you hope to share back with the world, then you probably fit the bill. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of Web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide.\n\n\n### How do I apply? \n\nOnce the crowdfund is complete, the DAO will run an open process for selecting applicants. [If you're interested in being notified about that process, opt-in here](https://creatorcabins.ck.page/9e628caec5).\n\n\n### How will the money be spent?\n\nAll money raised by the DAO will be used to fund residencies at Creator Cabins. We are budgeting 1/3rd of an ETH per creator-week, so 16 ETH can fund 3 cohorts (12 creators for a total of 48 weeks at the cabins). \n \n\n### What happens with the other 50% of $CABIN?\n\nThe DAO will retain 50% of $CABIN tokens to give to artists upon completion of their residencies, future supporters of the residency program, and whoever else CabinDAO decides to grant them to.\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1df7adbe-3a5c-49e0-95f2-d9af9e8c364e.jpg?height=1298&width=1946)\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/27723c84-ba7e-4cf2-b133-6b843455ecd1.jpg?height=1284&width=1950)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2a3ce5da-5f6d-4ce6-974a-83006b9ddcd4.jpg?height=1308&width=1960)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/39edd82a-9a14-4f91-9442-79e59c11eb5b.jpg?height=1292&width=1940)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8aca6bb-3fd6-457a-987e-c606089a5907.jpg?height=1254&width=1932)\n\n**Acknowledgements** \n\n*We're deeply grateful for the thoughts, ideas, support, feedback, encouragement, and advice we've received from the community over the past few weeks. \n\nThanks to @patrickxrivera, @thattallguy, XXX, for talking through the initial idea and helping set up the right structure for this project.\n\nThanks to @p_millerd and @kadlac for being the first people to contribute funds when this was still just an idea.*", "timestamp": 1621955164, "digest": "20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

It emerged from late-night conversations at the cabin where we are hosting this residency. \n\nAfter a year of pandemic, we had forgotten some of the magical energy of open-ended living and working with other people. You don't need to schedule a Zoom call with an agenda and a hard stop after 30 minutes. As you're drinking your morning coffee, you can end up down a rabbit hole, swapping book recommendations, productivity tools, and podcast episodes. The result: great conversations, deepened friendships, and exciting new ideas.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1df7adbe-3a5c-49e0-95f2-d9af9e8c364e.jpg?height=1298&width=1946)\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/27723c84-ba7e-4cf2-b133-6b843455ecd1.jpg?height=1284&width=1950)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2a3ce5da-5f6d-4ce6-974a-83006b9ddcd4.jpg?height=1308&width=1960)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/39edd82a-9a14-4f91-9442-79e59c11eb5b.jpg?height=1292&width=1940)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8aca6bb-3fd6-457a-987e-c606089a5907.jpg?height=1254&width=1932)\n\n**Acknowledgements** \n\n*We're deeply grateful for the thoughts, ideas, support, feedback, encouragement, and advice we've received from the community over the past few weeks.* \n\n*Thanks to @patrickxrivera, @thattallguy, XXX, for talking through the initial idea and helping set up the right structure for this project.*\n\n*Thanks to @p_millerd and @kadlac for being the first people to contribute funds when this was still just an idea.*\n\n*Thanks to @brianwlackey for the beautiful photography in this post.*", "timestamp": 1621957332, "digest": "20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

Instructions about both can be found later in this post.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6391a341-d325-447b-9f6c-f240928c8dcc.png?height=500&width=704)\n\n## Let us know you backed the crowdfund!\n\nSometimes it's easy to identify backers from their Ethereum addresses, and sometimes it's not. When you back the project, [tweet](https://twitter.com/compose/tweet) **@im_po_ss_ib_le** to help us match you up with your contribution!\n\n## What's Impossible Object?\n\nImpossible Object's books will exist at the intersection of crypto and legacy publishing. This means we'll be publishing innovative books the old-fashioned way, as trade paperbacks and eBooks. But we're also attempting something completely new: simultaneously releasing on the blockchain so that we can use crypto's capacities to help make new kinds of book.\n\n*Conversations on AI* will be the first result of this experiment. Crypto has already provided solutions for crowdfunding [fiction](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), [science](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/41443491289334730858714141368268395642829177615924976808738423867555824271361) and [music](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM); now it's philosophy's turn. Backers of $IMPOSSIBLE will see the **first ever philosophy book funded by crypto** brought into the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3d1d3f6a-456e-48cd-8b79-5d1140227771.jpg?height=2728&width=2728)\n\n## Who's taking part in the conversations – and why are they about AI?\n\nThe initial impetus for the project was to assemble a group of pioneering thinkers so they could discuss a topic that all of their work has a stake in, and publish their discussions as a public good.\n\nThat group ended up comprising **Reza Negarestani, Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester and Nick Srnicek**. And the topic that turned out to unite their interests was Artificial Intelligence. \n\nThese thinkers have previously dealt with AI from various angles: some have written about AI directly (Reza Negarestani's *Intelligence and Spirit* and Nick Srnicek's work on the political economy of AI), some engage with AI as a collaborator (Holly Herndon, Mat Dryhurst and SPAWN), while some have developed the notion of artificiality in itself as a means out of conceptual deadlock (Helen Hester and Benjamin Bratton).\n\nIn the three conversations on the topic, AI will act more as a crossroads than the sole focus. Our dialogists are fascinated by the impact that AI will have on politics, art, philosophy, education, terraforming, and many more things, meaning that although the dialogues may consistently pass through AI, they will almost certainly end up at surprising destinations.\n\nAnd in what way is this a 'new kind of book'? First, as mentioned already, it's the first ever philosophy book funded by crypto. Second, we will use the $IMPOSSIBLE token to steer the book through at least two distinct editions. After the first 'beta' edition, we will seek responses to the dialogues, which will be rewarded with $IMPOSSIBLE and published in all later editions. \n\nThis book will not be a static object, but instead a fluid one that uses the decentralised logic of the blockchain to open up new possibilities for collaboration.  More on all of this below.\n\nReza and Impossible Object's short essay on the themes of *Conversations on AI* can be found [here](https://r.mirror.xyz/zghnOjS2aVlowlZ5D7ocnswHVSLSe04ZG-ubaMFBHmI).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3650eb7b-b2d7-405a-833e-e96ab8ae0adc.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Reza Negarestani** is a philosopher and a former systems engineer. [He became known for his pioneering work of teory-fiction...] pioneering the Since the early 2000s, he has contributed extensively to journals and anthologies, and lectured at numerous international universities and institutes including Duke University, MIT, École Normale Supérieure, and Haus der Kulturen der Welt among others. Negarestani’s writings have been translated to twelve languages. Negarestani’s latest philosophical work is *Intelligence and Spirit*(Urbanomic/Sequence Press/MIT, 2018), a book investigating the meaning of intelligence at the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, theory of computation and the philosophy of German Idealism.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/36c1d3cb-b3d1-4273-85f4-ece4dbedcd0c.png?height=700&width=500)\n\n**Benjamin Bratton's** work spans Philosophy, Art, Design and Computer Science. He is Professor of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego. He is Program Director of The Terraforming programme at Strelka Institute of Media, Architecture and Design in Moscow. He is also a Visiting Professor at The European Graduate School,  SCI_Arc (The Southern California Institute of Architecture) and NYU Shanghai. He is the author of several books including *The Revenge of The Real: Politics for a Post-Pandemic World *(Verso, 2021) and *The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty*  (MIT Press, 2015).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5cb5a2e-846b-429c-b790-33688ae2084f.png?height=400&width=650)\n\n**Holly Herndon** operates at the edge of electronic and avant-garde pop music and emerges with a dynamic and disruptive canon of her own. On her most recent full-length album *PROTO* Herndon fronts and conducts an electronic pop choir comprised of both human and AI voices over a musical palette that encompasses everything from synths to Sacred Harp stylings. CNN noted that Herndon is “shaping the future of AI” and she has demonstrated this nexus of technological evolution and musical catharsis with elevated performances at The Barbican (London), Volksbühne (Berlin), Sónar (Barcelona), Unsound (Krakow), and Club 2 Club (Milan). The sounds synthesized on PROTO by Herndon, her AI “baby” Spawn, and the vocal ensemble combine elements from Herndon’s dynamic and idiosyncratic personal journey: the timeless folk traditions of her childhood experiences in church-going East Tennessee (particularly the prismatic layered practice of Sacred Harp singing), the avant-garde music she explored while at Mills College, and the radical club culture of Berlin, all enhanced by her recent PhD composition studies at Stanford University, researching machine learning and music. Herndon co-founded the podcast series Interdependence alongside Mat Dryhurst.\n\n**Mat Dryhurst** releases music, research and artworks solo and in conjunction with creative partner Holly Herndon. He teaches at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Music, Strelka Institute and the European Graduate School and hosts discussions with figures shaping 21st century culture on the Interdependence podcast.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d282a589-ee4b-4fc1-8a3f-5591651e2b5b.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Helen Hester** is Professor of Gender, Technology and Work at the University of West London. Her research interests include technology, social reproduction, and the future of work, and she is a member of the international feminist working group Laboria Cuboniks. Her books include *Beyond Explicit: Pornography and the Displacement of Sex* (SUNY Press, 2014), *Xenofeminism* (Polity, 2018), and *After Work: The Politics of Free Time* (Verso, 2022, with Nick Srnicek).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/088cd853-c10f-45b6-a521-c961f6b87d21.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n\n**Nick Srnicek** is a Lecturer in Digital Economy at King's College London. He is the author of *Platform Capitalism* (Polity, 2016), *Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work* (Verso, 2015 with Alex Williams).\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a9e8862-0cd7-4c28-a3d4-4a6e5ec3564a.png?height=511&width=664)\n\n\n\n## What's $IMPOSSIBLE?\n\n$IMPOSSIBLE is the token that backers of the crowdfund will receive in return for their contributions of ether. \n\nIf you're already familiar with Mirror crowdfunds and how they differ from regular crowdfunds, that won't need any explanation. But if you're new here, here's a lil explainer:\n\n- Holding $IMPOSSIBLE tokens not only proves you helped make the book happen in the first place, but also gives you a stake in the financial success of the book.\n- Once the book is completed, the text will be minted as an NFT on Zora and put up for a reserve auction.\n\n- When the NFT sells, its smart contract funnels funds back to $IMPOSSIBLE holders in proportion to the amount of $IMPOSSIBLE they hold.\n\n-  At that point, backers can choose to sell their $IMPOSSIBLE tokens on an exchange such as Uniswap, redeeming them for ether, or carry on holding them. Holders will receive financial upside whenever the NFT is auctioned again in the future.\n\n- $IMPOSSIBLE holders will be able to play a governance role by taking part in Snapshot polls relating to *Conversations on AI*.\n\n- That's not all. Hold on for a full explanation of additional benefits below.\n\n- Here's a simplified diagram of the process:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/033b5a4f-fbba-4432-906f-9bbbdc047376.jpg?height=1500&width=1500)\n\n\n\n\n## When will the conversations happen?\n\nAs soon as the crowdfund is over. \n\nAfter that, the publication of the book will occur in two stages.\n\n### Stage 1\n\nOnce the conversations have all taken place, they'll be published on Mirror as a 'beta' eBook of approximately 50,000 words – equivalent to about 200 printed pages. This will be free for all to read.\n\n### Stage 2\n\nThis is where things really start to get interesting. \n\nBefore the trade paperback is published, Impossible Object will seek responses to the dialogues from their first readership.

Films by Metahaven include *The Sprawl (Propaganda about Propaganda)* (2015), *Information Skies* (2016, nominated for the 2017 European Film Awards), *Hometown* (2018), *Eurasia (Questions on Happiness)* (2018), and *Chaos Theory* (2021). Solo exhibitions include *Turnarounds*, e-flux, New York (2019), *Version History*, ICA London (2018), *Earth*, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (2018), *Hometown*, Izolyatsia, Kyiv (2018), *Information Skies*, Auto Italia, London (2016), *The Sprawl*, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco (2015), and *Islands in the Cloud*, MoMA PS1, New York (2013). Recent publications include *PSYOP: An Anthology* (Koenig Books, London, 2018), and *Digital Tarkovsky* (Strelka Press, Moscow, 2018). \n\nNot only will Metahaven be doing editorial design for *Conversations on AI*; in line with a plan that will be repeated with future Impossible Object titles, the front cover image will be minted as a standalone NFT and auctioned a little further down the line. \n\nSome of the proceeds of this will go to iODAO, Impossible Object's creator DAO.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1464387a-458e-4d20-b694-34e576c840a0.png?height=409&width=430)\n\n\n\n## How much are you aiming to raise?\n\nWe're aiming to raise up to 25 ether. This will go to:\n\n- Our dialogists: Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester, Reza Negarestani and Nick Srnicek\n- Our designer, Metahaven\n- The costs of producing, marketing and distributing the book\n- The development of web3 functionality on Impossible Object's website and forthcoming Discord server, giving $IMPOSSIBLE holders access to the benefits that this entails.\n\n## What are the different tiers of backer rewards?\n\n**Every backer**\n- $IMPOSSIBLE tokens at the rate: 1 ether = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE.\n- Proportional stakes in the sale of the book's NFT as described above.\n- Proportional voting power in Snapshot polls relating to the book.\n- Mention in the book's acknowledgements.\n\n**0.125 ether+**\n- The above, plus...\n- Invitation to a 2hr Zoom roundtable on AI, led by Reza Negarestani and featuring participants in the book.\n\n**0.5 ether+**\n- The above, plus...\n- Signed special edition of the book.\n- Limited edition Impossible Object merch.\n\n**0.75 ether+**\n- The above, plus...\n- One-of-a-kind *Conversations on AI* poster by Metahaven.\n\n**1 ether+**\n- The above, plus...\n- A one-on-one call with Reza Negarestani on the topics covered in *Conversations on AI*.\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0b9be0ef-5b18-48c2-bb36-f3f6a864d411.png?height=493&width=634)\n\n\n\n**Futher information about the crowdfund**\n\n- The crowdfund will begin at Xpm on 25th May on this page.\n- The crowdfund is first come, first serve. Once it's closed, it will no longer be possible to make contributions.\n- You will need an Ethereum wallet and some ether to participate. If you don’t have a wallet, Rainbow’s mobile app is a good option for iOS users. Alternatively, there's Metamask (iOS, Android and web).\n- 1 ether = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE. For example, someone contributing 0.5 ether will receive 500 $IMPOSSIBLE.\n- Ether transactions involve a transaction fee (Tx fee). The level of the Tx fee varies with the price of 'gas' on the network, which can be checked [here](https://ethgasstation.info/). If gas prices are too high, wait and try again later for a more reasonable overall Tx fee.\n- If you are new to this and need any advice, reach out on the Impossible Object [Telegram group](t.me/impossibleobject).

Instructions about both can be found later in this post.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6391a341-d325-447b-9f6c-f240928c8dcc.png?height=500&width=704)\n\n## Let us know you backed the crowdfund!\n\nSometimes it's easy to identify backers from their Ethereum addresses; sometimes less so. When you back the project, [tweet](https://twitter.com/compose/tweet) **@im_po_ss_ib_le** to help us match you up with your contribution!\n\n## What's Impossible Object?\n\nImpossible Object's books will exist at the intersection of crypto and legacy publishing. This means we'll be publishing innovative books the old-fashioned way, as trade paperbacks and eBooks. But we're also attempting something completely new: simultaneously releasing on the blockchain so that we can use crypto's capacities to help make new kinds of book.\n\n*Conversations on AI* will be the first result of this experiment. Crypto has already provided solutions for crowdfunding [fiction](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), [science](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/41443491289334730858714141368268395642829177615924976808738423867555824271361) and [music](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM); now it's philosophy's turn. Backers of $IMPOSSIBLE will see the **first ever philosophy book funded by crypto** brought into the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3d1d3f6a-456e-48cd-8b79-5d1140227771.jpg?height=2728&width=2728)\n\n## Who's taking part in the conversations – and why are they about AI?\n\nThe initial impetus for the project was to assemble a group of pioneering thinkers so they could discuss a topic that all of their work has a stake in, and publish their discussions as a public good.\n\nThat group ended up comprising **Reza Negarestani, Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester and Nick Srnicek**. And the topic that turned out to unite their interests was Artificial Intelligence. \n\nThese thinkers have previously dealt with AI from various angles: some have written about AI directly (Reza Negarestani's *Intelligence and Spirit* and Nick Srnicek's work on the political economy of AI), some engage with AI as a collaborator (Holly Herndon, Mat Dryhurst and SPAWN), while some have developed the notion of artificiality in itself as a means out of conceptual deadlock (Helen Hester and Benjamin Bratton).\n\nIn the three conversations on the topic, AI will act more as a crossroads than the sole focus. Our dialogists are fascinated by the impact that AI will have on politics, art, philosophy, education, terraforming, and many more things, meaning that although the dialogues may consistently pass through AI, they will almost certainly end up at surprising destinations.\n\nAnd in what way is this a 'new kind of book'? First, as mentioned already, it's the first ever philosophy book funded by crypto. Second, we will use the $IMPOSSIBLE token to steer the book through at least two distinct editions. After the first 'beta' edition, we will seek responses to the dialogues, which will be rewarded with $IMPOSSIBLE and published in all later editions. \n\nThis book will not be a static object, but instead a fluid one that uses the decentralised logic of the blockchain to open up new possibilities for collaboration.  More on all of this below.\n\nReza and Impossible Object's short essay on the themes of *Conversations on AI* can be found [here](https://r.mirror.xyz/zghnOjS2aVlowlZ5D7ocnswHVSLSe04ZG-ubaMFBHmI).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3650eb7b-b2d7-405a-833e-e96ab8ae0adc.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Reza Negarestani** is a philosopher and a former systems engineer. He originally became known for pioneering his pioneering work of theory-fiction *Cyclonopedia* (2008). Since the early 2000s, he has contributed extensively to journals and anthologies, and lectured at numerous international universities and institutes including Duke University, MIT, École Normale Supérieure, and Haus der Kulturen der Welt among others. Negarestani’s writings have been translated into twelve languages. Negarestani’s latest philosophical work is *Intelligence and Spirit*(Urbanomic/Sequence Press/MIT, 2018), a book investigating the meaning of intelligence at the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, theory of computation and the philosophy of German Idealism.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/36c1d3cb-b3d1-4273-85f4-ece4dbedcd0c.png?height=700&width=500)\n\n**Benjamin Bratton's** work spans Philosophy, Art, Design and Computer Science. He is Professor of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego. He is Program Director of The Terraforming programme at Strelka Institute of Media, Architecture and Design in Moscow. He is also a Visiting Professor at The European Graduate School,  SCI_Arc (The Southern California Institute of Architecture) and NYU Shanghai. He is the author of several books including *The Revenge of The Real: Politics for a Post-Pandemic World *(Verso, 2021) and *The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty*  (MIT Press, 2015).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5cb5a2e-846b-429c-b790-33688ae2084f.png?height=400&width=650)\n\n**Holly Herndon** operates at the edge of electronic and avant-garde pop music and emerges with a dynamic and disruptive canon of her own. On her most recent full-length album *PROTO* Herndon fronts and conducts an electronic pop choir comprised of both human and AI voices over a musical palette that encompasses everything from synths to Sacred Harp stylings. CNN noted that Herndon is 'shaping the future of AI' and she has demonstrated this nexus of technological evolution and musical catharsis with elevated performances at The Barbican (London), Volksbühne (Berlin), Sónar (Barcelona), Unsound (Krakow), and Club 2 Club (Milan). The sounds synthesized on PROTO by Herndon, her AI “baby” Spawn, and the vocal ensemble combine elements from Herndon’s dynamic and idiosyncratic personal journey: the timeless folk traditions of her childhood experiences in church-going East Tennessee (particularly the prismatic layered practice of Sacred Harp singing), the avant-garde music she explored while at Mills College, and the radical club culture of Berlin, all enhanced by her recent PhD composition studies at Stanford University, researching machine learning and music. Herndon co-founded the podcast series Interdependence alongside Mat Dryhurst.\n\n**Mat Dryhurst** releases music, research and artworks solo and in conjunction with creative partner Holly Herndon. He teaches at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Music, Strelka Institute and the European Graduate School and hosts discussions with figures shaping 21st century culture on the Interdependence podcast.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d282a589-ee4b-4fc1-8a3f-5591651e2b5b.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Helen Hester** is Professor of Gender, Technology and Work at the University of West London. Her research interests include technology, social reproduction, and the future of work, and she is a member of the international feminist working group Laboria Cuboniks. Her books include *Beyond Explicit: Pornography and the Displacement of Sex* (SUNY Press, 2014), *Xenofeminism* (Polity, 2018), and *After Work: The Politics of Free Time* (Verso, 2022, with Nick Srnicek).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/088cd853-c10f-45b6-a521-c961f6b87d21.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n\n**Nick Srnicek** is a Lecturer in Digital Economy at King's College London. He is the author of *Platform Capitalism* (Polity, 2016), *Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work* (Verso, 2015 with Alex Williams).\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a9e8862-0cd7-4c28-a3d4-4a6e5ec3564a.png?height=511&width=664)\n\n\n\n## What's $IMPOSSIBLE?\n\n$IMPOSSIBLE is the token that backers of the crowdfund will receive in return for their contributions of ETH. \n\nIf you're already familiar with Mirror crowdfunds and how they differ from regular crowdfunds, that won't need any explanation. But if you're new here, here's a lil explainer:\n\n- Holding $IMPOSSIBLE tokens not only proves you helped make the book happen in the first place, but also gives you a stake in the financial success of the book.\n- Once the book is completed, the text will be minted as an NFT on Zora and put up for a reserve auction.\n\n- When the NFT sells, its smart contract funnels funds back to $IMPOSSIBLE holders in proportion to the amount of $IMPOSSIBLE they hold.\n\n-  At that point, backers can choose to sell their $IMPOSSIBLE tokens on an exchange such as Uniswap, redeeming them for ETH, or carry on holding them. Holders will receive financial upside whenever the NFT is auctioned again by future owners.\n\n- $IMPOSSIBLE holders will be able to play a governance role by taking part in Snapshot polls relating to *Conversations on AI*.\n\n- That's not all. Hold on for a full explanation of additional benefits after the jump.\n\n- This is pretty complicated, so in case it helps, please find a simplified diagram of the process below.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/033b5a4f-fbba-4432-906f-9bbbdc047376.jpg?height=1500&width=1500)\n\n\n\n\n## When will the conversations happen?\n\nAs soon as the crowdfund is over! We can't wait.\n\nAfter that, the publication of the book will occur in two stages.\n\n### Stage 1\n\nOnce the conversations have all taken place, they'll be published on Mirror as a 'beta' eBook of approximately 50,000 words – equivalent to about 200 printed pages. This will be free for all to read.\n\n### Stage 2\n\nThis is where things really start to get interesting. \n\nBefore the trade paperback is published, Impossible Object will seek responses to the dialogues from their first readership. The call for proposed responses will be open to **all** readers, not just holders of $IMPOSSIBLE. One to three of these will be published alongside the main dialogues in the first full print and electronic edition of the book, and the authors will be rewarded with $IMPOSSIBLE tokens.\n\nAlso, the names of the original backers and holders of the $IMPOSSIBLE token will be included the acknowledgements and logged forever on the blockchain in recognition of the role they played in making the book happen.\n\nPrinting commentaries and objections alongside the main text has a long tradition, stretching back before Descartes' *Meditations*. But with Mirror's help we're giving things a web3 twist.\n\n### Stage 3?\n\nOur seeking responses to the book needn't stop there. Impossible Object will retain some $IMPOSSIBLE tokens to send to authors of future responses, which would also be published in further editions on the book.\n\n\n![Still from Metahaven's \"The Sprawl\"](https://thefader-res.cloudinary.com/private_images/w_1800,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:best/screen_shot_2016-04-20_at_21.52.37_rqwpvi/screenshot-from-i-the-sprawl-i.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Who will design *Conversations on AI*?\nWe're excited to say that editorial design for the book and for Impossible Object's future titles will be by the incredible **Metahaven**.\n\nThe work of Metahaven consists of filmmaking, writing, and design.

Once it's closed, it will no longer be possible to make contributions.\n- You will need an Ethereum wallet and some ETH to participate. If you don’t have a wallet, Rainbow’s mobile app is a good option for iOS users. Alternatively, there's Metamask (iOS, Android and web).\n- 1 ETH = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE. For example, someone contributing 0.5 ETH will receive 500 $IMPOSSIBLE.\n- ETH transactions involve a transaction fee (Tx fee). The level of the Tx fee varies with the price of 'gas' on the network, which can be checked [here](https://ethgasstation.info/). If gas prices are too high, wait and try again later for a more reasonable overall Tx fee.\n- If you are new to this and need any advice, reach out on the Impossible Object [Telegram group](t.me/impossibleobject).

Instructions about both can be found later in this post.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6391a341-d325-447b-9f6c-f240928c8dcc.png?height=500&width=704)\n\n## Let us know you backed the crowdfund!\n\nSometimes it's easy to identify backers from their Ethereum addresses; sometimes less so. When you back the project, [tweet](https://twitter.com/compose/tweet) **@im_po_ss_ib_le** to help us match you up with your contribution!\n\n## What's Impossible Object?\n\nImpossible Object's books will exist at the intersection of crypto and legacy publishing. This means we'll be publishing innovative books the old-fashioned way, as trade paperbacks and eBooks. But we're also attempting something completely new: simultaneously releasing on the blockchain so that we can use crypto's capacities to help make new kinds of book.\n\n*Conversations on AI* will be the first result of this experiment. Crypto has already provided solutions for crowdfunding [fiction](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), [science](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/41443491289334730858714141368268395642829177615924976808738423867555824271361) and [music](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM); now it's philosophy's turn. Backers of $IMPOSSIBLE will see the **first ever philosophy book funded by crypto** brought into the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3d1d3f6a-456e-48cd-8b79-5d1140227771.jpg?height=2728&width=2728)\n\n## Who's taking part in the conversations – and why are they about AI?\n\nThe initial impetus for the project was to assemble a group of pioneering thinkers so they could discuss a topic that all of their work has a stake in, and publish their discussions as a public good.\n\nThat group ended up comprising **Reza Negarestani, Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester and Nick Srnicek**. And the topic that turned out to unite their interests was Artificial Intelligence. \n\nThese thinkers have previously dealt with AI from various angles: some have written about AI directly (Reza Negarestani's *Intelligence and Spirit* and Nick Srnicek's work on the political economy of AI), some engage with AI as a collaborator (Holly Herndon, Mat Dryhurst and SPAWN), while some have developed the notion of artificiality in itself as a means out of conceptual deadlock (Helen Hester and Benjamin Bratton).\n\nIn the three conversations on the topic, AI will act more as a crossroads than the sole focus. Our dialogists are fascinated by the impact that AI will have on politics, art, philosophy, education, terraforming, and many more things, meaning that although the dialogues may consistently pass through AI, they will almost certainly end up at surprising destinations.\n\nAnd in what way is this a 'new kind of book'? First, as mentioned already, it's the first ever philosophy book funded by crypto. Second, we will use the $IMPOSSIBLE token to steer the book through at least two distinct editions. After the first 'beta' edition, we will seek responses to the dialogues, which will be rewarded with $IMPOSSIBLE and published in all later editions. \n\nThis book will not be a static object, but instead a fluid one that uses the decentralised logic of the blockchain to open up new possibilities for collaboration.  More on all of this below.\n\nReza and Impossible Object's short essay on the themes of *Conversations on AI* can be found [here](https://r.mirror.xyz/zghnOjS2aVlowlZ5D7ocnswHVSLSe04ZG-ubaMFBHmI).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3650eb7b-b2d7-405a-833e-e96ab8ae0adc.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Reza Negarestani** is a philosopher and a former systems engineer. He originally became known for pioneering his pioneering work of theory-fiction *Cyclonopedia* (2008). Since the early 2000s, he has contributed extensively to journals and anthologies, and lectured at numerous international universities and institutes including Duke University, MIT, École Normale Supérieure, and Haus der Kulturen der Welt among others. Negarestani’s writings have been translated into twelve languages. Negarestani’s latest philosophical work is *Intelligence and Spirit*(Urbanomic/Sequence Press/MIT, 2018), a book investigating the meaning of intelligence at the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, theory of computation and the philosophy of German Idealism.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/36c1d3cb-b3d1-4273-85f4-ece4dbedcd0c.png?height=700&width=500)\n\n**Benjamin Bratton's** work spans Philosophy, Art, Design and Computer Science. He is Professor of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego. He is Program Director of The Terraforming programme at Strelka Institute of Media, Architecture and Design in Moscow. He is also a Visiting Professor at The European Graduate School,  SCI_Arc (The Southern California Institute of Architecture) and NYU Shanghai. He is the author of several books including *The Revenge of The Real: Politics for a Post-Pandemic World *(Verso, 2021) and *The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty*  (MIT Press, 2015).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5cb5a2e-846b-429c-b790-33688ae2084f.png?height=400&width=650)\n\n**Holly Herndon** operates at the edge of electronic and avant-garde pop music and emerges with a dynamic and disruptive canon of her own. On her most recent full-length album *PROTO* Herndon fronts and conducts an electronic pop choir comprised of both human and AI voices over a musical palette that encompasses everything from synths to Sacred Harp stylings. CNN noted that Herndon is 'shaping the future of AI' and she has demonstrated this nexus of technological evolution and musical catharsis with elevated performances at The Barbican (London), Volksbühne (Berlin), Sónar (Barcelona), Unsound (Krakow), and Club 2 Club (Milan). The sounds synthesized on PROTO by Herndon, her AI “baby” Spawn, and the vocal ensemble combine elements from Herndon’s dynamic and idiosyncratic personal journey: the timeless folk traditions of her childhood experiences in church-going East Tennessee (particularly the prismatic layered practice of Sacred Harp singing), the avant-garde music she explored while at Mills College, and the radical club culture of Berlin, all enhanced by her recent PhD composition studies at Stanford University, researching machine learning and music. Herndon co-founded the podcast series Interdependence alongside Mat Dryhurst.\n\n**Mat Dryhurst** releases music, research and artworks solo and in conjunction with creative partner Holly Herndon. He teaches at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Music, Strelka Institute and the European Graduate School and hosts discussions with figures shaping 21st century culture on the Interdependence podcast.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d282a589-ee4b-4fc1-8a3f-5591651e2b5b.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Helen Hester** is Professor of Gender, Technology and Work at the University of West London. Her research interests include technology, social reproduction, and the future of work, and she is a member of the international feminist working group Laboria Cuboniks. Her books include *Beyond Explicit: Pornography and the Displacement of Sex* (SUNY Press, 2014), *Xenofeminism* (Polity, 2018), and *After Work: The Politics of Free Time* (Verso, 2022, with Nick Srnicek).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/088cd853-c10f-45b6-a521-c961f6b87d21.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n\n**Nick Srnicek** is a Lecturer in Digital Economy at King's College London. He is the author of *Platform Capitalism* (Polity, 2016), *Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work* (Verso, 2015 with Alex Williams).\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a9e8862-0cd7-4c28-a3d4-4a6e5ec3564a.png?height=511&width=664)\n\n\n\n## What's $IMPOSSIBLE?\n\n$IMPOSSIBLE is the token that backers of the crowdfund will receive in return for their contributions of ETH. \n\nIf you're already familiar with Mirror crowdfunds and how they differ from regular crowdfunds, that won't need any explanation. But if you're new here, here's a lil explainer:\n\n- Holding $IMPOSSIBLE tokens not only proves you helped make the book happen in the first place, but also gives you a stake in the financial success of the book.\n- Once the book is completed, the text will be minted as an NFT on Zora and put up for a reserve auction.\n\n- When the NFT sells, its smart contract funnels funds back to $IMPOSSIBLE holders in proportion to the amount of $IMPOSSIBLE they hold.\n\n-  At that point, backers can choose to sell their $IMPOSSIBLE tokens on an exchange such as Uniswap, redeeming them for ETH, or carry on holding them. Holders will receive financial upside whenever the NFT is auctioned again by future owners.\n\n- $IMPOSSIBLE holders will be able to play a governance role by taking part in Snapshot polls relating to *Conversations on AI*.\n\n- That's not all. Hold on for a full explanation of additional benefits after the jump.\n\n- This is pretty complicated, so in case it helps, please find a simplified diagram of the process below.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/033b5a4f-fbba-4432-906f-9bbbdc047376.jpg?height=1500&width=1500)\n\n\n\n\n## When will the conversations happen?\n\nAs soon as the crowdfund is over! We can't wait.\n\nAfter that, the publication of the book will occur in two stages.\n\n### Stage 1\n\nOnce the conversations have all taken place, they'll be published on Mirror as a 'beta' eBook of approximately 50,000 words – equivalent to about 200 printed pages. This will be free for all to read.\n\n### Stage 2\n\nThis is where things really start to get interesting. \n\nBefore the trade paperback is published, Impossible Object will seek responses to the dialogues from their first readership. The call for proposed responses will be open to **all** readers, not just holders of $IMPOSSIBLE. One to three of these will be published alongside the main dialogues in the first full print and electronic edition of the book, and the authors will be rewarded with $IMPOSSIBLE tokens.\n\nAlso, the names of the original backers and holders of the $IMPOSSIBLE token will be included the acknowledgements and logged forever on the blockchain in recognition of the role they played in making the book happen.\n\nPrinting commentaries and objections alongside the main text has a long tradition, stretching back before Descartes' *Meditations*. But with Mirror's help we're giving things a web3 twist.\n\n### Stage 3?\n\nOur seeking responses to the book needn't stop there. Impossible Object will retain some $IMPOSSIBLE tokens to send to authors of future responses, which would also be published in further editions on the book.\n\n\n![Still from Metahaven's \"The Sprawl\"](https://thefader-res.cloudinary.com/private_images/w_1800,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:best/screen_shot_2016-04-20_at_21.52.37_rqwpvi/screenshot-from-i-the-sprawl-i.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Who will design *Conversations on AI*?\nWe're excited to say that editorial design for the book and for Impossible Object's future titles will be by the incredible **Metahaven**.\n\nThe work of Metahaven consists of filmmaking, writing, and design.

It's an experiment in [universal creator income](https://li.substack.com/p/the-case-for-universal-creative-income), [tech stacks for decentralized cities](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4), and the physical [manifestation of DAOs](https://twitter.com/jongold/status/1395390112205352962?s=20).\n\n\n[CabinDAO](crowdfund://0x94515e4f6fabad73C8bCdd8cd42f0b5C037E2c49?network=homestead)\n\n\nThis is a crowdfund for one year of cumulative time living and building at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) in the Texas Hill Country. We're situated on 28 acres of land about 45 minutes from downtown Austin, and we just built a new cabin designed as a collaborative co-living and working space for independent online creators. Our cabins are the first nodes in what we hope will one day be a [decentralized city](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/decentralized-cities/):\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aff070f7-1ccb-4868-8a53-64505c093fee.jpg?height=1174&width=1710)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f7f4c3a9-0d4d-4403-8a28-23432eb32a98.jpg?height=1286&width=1954)\n\n[The land & cabins are our hardware](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4). Now we're starting to experiment with on-chain governance software. We will set up CabinDAO to manage this crowdfund. All contributors will be awarded $CABIN tokens, which can be used to vote for creator residency proposals. While the DAO will ultimately govern the use of the funds, here's a rough sketch of how we are thinking about structuring the program:\n\n## CabinDAO\n\nWe want to crowdfund 12 months' worth of time at the cabins. This would allow $CABIN holders to vote and fund 12 creators to come for a one-month stay each. The new cabin has four bedrooms, so we would run three cohorts of four creators each.\n\nThe DAO will set up an open application process, perhaps similar to $WRITE RACE). Winners will be invited to Creator Cabins outside of Austin, TX to work on their projects——or ride the waves of synchronicity & decide to collaborate. \n\nAt the end of the month, we will help each creator mint an NFT representing their work at the residency. Our intention is for the CabinDAO community (IRL in Texas, and globally on Discord) to help creators best use emergent web3 patterns to collaborate and share their work.\n\nWhile the first use-case for this DAO is creator residencies, we hope to learn from this experiment and continue to find ways to sustainably fund independent online creators and develop DAO-based governance models for physical spaces. CabinDAO community adds a node to an interdependent network of the new Creator Economy. The edges of CabinDAO are permeable and open to all forms of contribution. We're especially excited about mutually beneficial web3 native collaborations with other DAOs working toward similar visions.\n\nThis project came together over the course of a two-week stay at Creator Cabins by members of [creator.coop](https://creator.coop). We didn't go into our stay intending to make this——the plan emerged from two weeks of co-working, co-living, and co-creating at the cabins. \n\nEveryone came into their time at the cabins with projects they wanted to finish, but late-night conversations around the fire got us all inspired to think about opening the space up to the whole community, regardless of financial means. We hope the residency program can help inspire more collaborative, community-oriented projects like this one.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2c1549c9-0d03-4b4e-914c-d50f07800d22.jpg?height=1284&width=1932)\n\n\n## FAQs\n\n### How do I contribute?\n\nUsing Mirror's widget embedded in this post, you can send ETH to CabinDAO's crowdfund. All contributors will be awarded $CABIN tokens and invited to our Discord community to begin putting together the plan to fund residencies. Contributions are capped at 2 ETH to maximize participation and ensure balanced governance.\n\n\n### Who is eligible for a residency?\n\nAnyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of the term “creator”: digital artists, musicians, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders. If you’re building something that you hope to share back with the world, then you probably fit the bill. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide.\n\n\n### How do I apply for a residency? \n\nOnce the crowdfund is complete, the DAO will run an open process for selecting applicants. [If you're interested in being notified about that process, opt-in here](https://creatorcabins.ck.page/9e628caec5).\n\n\n### How will the money be spent?\n\nAll money raised by the DAO will be used to fund residencies at Creator Cabins. We are budgeting 1/2th of an ETH per creator-week, so 24 ETH can fund 3 cohorts (12 creators for 4 weeks each the cabins). This provides enough funding for room, board, and services to support creators during their stay.\n\n\n### How will the DAO sustain itself?\n\nAt the end of each residency, we will help creators mint an NFT representing their work. The NFTs could be held and curated by the CabinDAO treasury or sold back to the community with a split of the proceeds going to the artist and the DAO. \n\nWe hope this structure can help produce value for the community and creator residents while contributing to the long-term sustainability of this model. This is a patronage project designed to provide the gift of time and space to our community. Contributors to the DAO should not expect any financial return.\n\n\n### What happens with the other 50% of $CABIN?\n\nCabinDAO will retain 50% of $CABIN tokens to give to artists upon completion of their residencies, collaborators, other communally beneficial DAOs, future supporters of the residency program, and whoever else CabinDAO decides to grant them to.\n\n\n### Is this co-ownership in the cabins?\n\nNo. CabinDAO is a separate entity, managing the endowment of our creative residency program. This is our first experiment with web3 governance, and we hope to use the lessons from this project to progressively decentralize other aspects of this project in the future.\n\n\n### Why IRL?\n\nThis project never would have happened without the open-ended space to explore and collaborate IRL. It emerged from late-night conversations at the cabin where we are hosting this residency. \n\nAfter a year of pandemic, we had forgotten some of the magical energy of open-ended living and working with other people. You don't need to schedule a Zoom call with an agenda and a hard stop after 30 minutes. As you're drinking your morning coffee, you can end up down a rabbit hole, swapping book recommendations, productivity tools, and podcast episodes. The result: great conversations, deepened friendships, and exciting new ideas.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1df7adbe-3a5c-49e0-95f2-d9af9e8c364e.jpg?height=1298&width=1946)\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/27723c84-ba7e-4cf2-b133-6b843455ecd1.jpg?height=1284&width=1950)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2a3ce5da-5f6d-4ce6-974a-83006b9ddcd4.jpg?height=1308&width=1960)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/39edd82a-9a14-4f91-9442-79e59c11eb5b.jpg?height=1292&width=1940)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8aca6bb-3fd6-457a-987e-c606089a5907.jpg?height=1254&width=1932)\n\n\n[CabinDAO](crowdfund://0x94515e4f6fabad73C8bCdd8cd42f0b5C037E2c49?network=homestead)\n\n\n\n**Acknowledgements** \n\n*Our ideas are building on the prior art, shared learnings & enlightening conversations we’ve had with many others over the past few months.*\n\n*Thanks to @patrickxrivera, @thattallguy, @sirsuhayb, @js_horne, @ljin18, @drewcoffman, and @jarroddicker for talking through the initial idea and helping set up the right structure for this project.*\n\n*Thanks to Seed Club, Songcamp, PartyDAO, herstoryDAO, and the Mint Fund for feedback, inspiration, and advice.*\n\n*Thanks to @p_millerd and @kadlac for being the first people to contribute funds when this was still just an idea.*\n\n*Thanks to @brianwlackey for the beautiful photography in this post.*", "timestamp": 1621973236, "digest": "20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

Instructions about both can be found later in this post.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6391a341-d325-447b-9f6c-f240928c8dcc.png?height=500&width=704)\n\n## Let us know you backed the crowdfund!\n\nSometimes it's easy to identify backers from their Ethereum addresses; sometimes less so. When you back the project, [tweet](https://twitter.com/compose/tweet) **@im_po_ss_ib_le** to help us match you up with your contribution!\n\n## What's Impossible Object?\n\nImpossible Object's books will exist at the intersection of crypto and legacy publishing. This means we'll be publishing innovative books the old-fashioned way, as trade paperbacks and eBooks. But we're also attempting something completely new: simultaneously releasing on the blockchain so that we can use crypto's capacities to help make new kinds of book.\n\n*Conversations on AI* will be the first result of this experiment. Crypto has already provided solutions for crowdfunding [fiction](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), [science](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/41443491289334730858714141368268395642829177615924976808738423867555824271361) and [music](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM); now it's philosophy's turn. Backers of $IMPOSSIBLE will see the **first ever philosophy book funded by crypto** brought into the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3d1d3f6a-456e-48cd-8b79-5d1140227771.jpg?height=2728&width=2728)\n\n## Who's taking part in the conversations – and why are they about AI?\n\nThe initial impetus for the project was to assemble a group of pioneering thinkers so they could discuss a topic that all of their work has a stake in, and publish their discussions as a public good.\n\nThat group ended up comprising **Reza Negarestani, Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester and Nick Srnicek**. And the topic that turned out to unite their interests was Artificial Intelligence. \n\nThese thinkers have previously dealt with AI from various angles: some have written about AI directly (Reza Negarestani's *Intelligence and Spirit* and Nick Srnicek's work on the political economy of AI), some engage with AI as a collaborator (Holly Herndon, Mat Dryhurst and SPAWN), while some have developed the notion of artificiality in itself as a means out of conceptual deadlock (Helen Hester and Benjamin Bratton).\n\nIn the three conversations on the topic, AI will act more as a crossroads than the sole focus. Our dialogists are fascinated by the impact that AI will have on politics, art, philosophy, education, terraforming, and many more things, meaning that although the dialogues may consistently pass through AI, they will almost certainly end up at surprising destinations.\n\nAnd in what way is this a 'new kind of book'? First, as mentioned already, it's the first ever philosophy book funded by crypto. Second, we will use the $IMPOSSIBLE token to steer the book through at least two distinct editions. After the first 'beta' edition, we will seek responses to the dialogues, which will be rewarded with $IMPOSSIBLE and published in all later editions. \n\nThis book will not be a static object, but instead a fluid one that uses the decentralised logic of the blockchain to open up new possibilities for collaboration.  More on all of this below.\n\nReza and Impossible Object's short essay on the themes of *Conversations on AI* can be found [here](https://r.mirror.xyz/zghnOjS2aVlowlZ5D7ocnswHVSLSe04ZG-ubaMFBHmI).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3650eb7b-b2d7-405a-833e-e96ab8ae0adc.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Reza Negarestani** is a philosopher and a former systems engineer. He originally became known for pioneering his pioneering work of theory-fiction *Cyclonopedia* (2008). Since the early 2000s, he has contributed extensively to journals and anthologies, and lectured at numerous international universities and institutes including Duke University, MIT, École Normale Supérieure, and Haus der Kulturen der Welt among others. Negarestani’s writings have been translated into twelve languages. Negarestani’s latest philosophical work is *Intelligence and Spirit*(Urbanomic/Sequence Press/MIT, 2018), a book investigating the meaning of intelligence at the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, theory of computation and the philosophy of German Idealism.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/36c1d3cb-b3d1-4273-85f4-ece4dbedcd0c.png?height=700&width=500)\n\n**Benjamin Bratton's** work spans Philosophy, Art, Design and Computer Science. He is Professor of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego. He is Program Director of The Terraforming programme at Strelka Institute of Media, Architecture and Design in Moscow. He is also a Visiting Professor at The European Graduate School,  SCI_Arc (The Southern California Institute of Architecture) and NYU Shanghai. He is the author of several books including *The Revenge of The Real: Politics for a Post-Pandemic World *(Verso, 2021) and *The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty*  (MIT Press, 2015).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5cb5a2e-846b-429c-b790-33688ae2084f.png?height=400&width=650)\n\n**Holly Herndon** operates at the edge of electronic and avant-garde pop music and emerges with a dynamic and disruptive canon of her own. On her most recent full-length album *PROTO* Herndon fronts and conducts an electronic pop choir comprised of both human and AI voices over a musical palette that encompasses everything from synths to Sacred Harp stylings. CNN noted that Herndon is 'shaping the future of AI' and she has demonstrated this nexus of technological evolution and musical catharsis with elevated performances at The Barbican (London), Volksbühne (Berlin), Sónar (Barcelona), Unsound (Krakow), and Club 2 Club (Milan). The sounds synthesized on PROTO by Herndon, her AI “baby” Spawn, and the vocal ensemble combine elements from Herndon’s dynamic and idiosyncratic personal journey: the timeless folk traditions of her childhood experiences in church-going East Tennessee (particularly the prismatic layered practice of Sacred Harp singing), the avant-garde music she explored while at Mills College, and the radical club culture of Berlin, all enhanced by her recent PhD composition studies at Stanford University, researching machine learning and music. Herndon co-founded the podcast series Interdependence alongside Mat Dryhurst.\n\n**Mat Dryhurst** releases music, research and artworks solo and in conjunction with creative partner Holly Herndon. He teaches at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Music, Strelka Institute and the European Graduate School and hosts discussions with figures shaping 21st century culture on the Interdependence podcast.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d282a589-ee4b-4fc1-8a3f-5591651e2b5b.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Helen Hester** is Professor of Gender, Technology and Work at the University of West London. Her research interests include technology, social reproduction, and the future of work, and she is a member of the international feminist working group Laboria Cuboniks. Her books include *Beyond Explicit: Pornography and the Displacement of Sex* (SUNY Press, 2014), *Xenofeminism* (Polity, 2018), and *After Work: The Politics of Free Time* (Verso, 2022, with Nick Srnicek).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/088cd853-c10f-45b6-a521-c961f6b87d21.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n\n**Nick Srnicek** is a Lecturer in Digital Economy at King's College London. He is the author of *Platform Capitalism* (Polity, 2016), *Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work* (Verso, 2015 with Alex Williams).\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a9e8862-0cd7-4c28-a3d4-4a6e5ec3564a.png?height=511&width=664)\n\n\n\n## What's $IMPOSSIBLE?\n\n$IMPOSSIBLE is the token that backers of the crowdfund will receive in return for their contributions of ETH. \n\nIf you're already familiar with Mirror crowdfunds and how they differ from regular crowdfunds, that won't need any explanation. But if you're new here, here's a lil explainer:\n\n- Holding $IMPOSSIBLE tokens not only proves you helped make the book happen in the first place, but also gives you a stake in the financial success of the book.\n- Once the book is completed, the text will be minted as an NFT on Zora and put up for a reserve auction.\n\n- When the NFT sells, its smart contract funnels funds back to $IMPOSSIBLE holders in proportion to the amount of $IMPOSSIBLE they hold.\n\n-  At that point, backers can choose to sell their $IMPOSSIBLE tokens on an exchange such as Uniswap, redeeming them for ETH, or carry on holding them. Holders will receive financial upside whenever the NFT is auctioned again by future owners.\n\n- $IMPOSSIBLE holders will be able to play a governance role by taking part in Snapshot polls relating to *Conversations on AI*.\n\n- That's not all. Hold on for a full explanation of additional benefits after the jump.\n\n- This is pretty complicated, so in case it helps, please find a simplified diagram of the process below.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/033b5a4f-fbba-4432-906f-9bbbdc047376.jpg?height=1500&width=1500)\n\n\n\n\n## When will the conversations happen?\n\nAs soon as the crowdfund is over! We can't wait.\n\nAfter that, the publication of the book will occur in two stages.\n\n### Stage 1\n\nOnce the conversations have all taken place, they'll be published on Mirror as a 'beta' eBook of approximately 50,000 words – equivalent to about 200 printed pages. This will be free for all to read.\n\n### Stage 2\n\nThis is where things really start to get interesting. \n\nBefore the trade paperback is published, Impossible Object will seek responses to the dialogues from their first readership. The call for proposed responses will be open to **all** readers, not just holders of $IMPOSSIBLE. One to three of these will be published alongside the main dialogues in the first full print and electronic edition of the book, and the authors will be rewarded with $IMPOSSIBLE tokens.\n\nAlso, the names of the original backers and holders of the $IMPOSSIBLE token will be included the acknowledgements and logged forever on the blockchain in recognition of the role they played in making the book happen.\n\nPrinting commentaries and objections alongside the main text has a long tradition, stretching back before Descartes' *Meditations*. But with Mirror's help we're giving things a web3 twist.\n\n### Stage 3?\n\nOur seeking responses to the book needn't stop there. Impossible Object will retain some $IMPOSSIBLE tokens to send to authors of future responses, which would also be published in further editions on the book.\n\n\n![Still from Metahaven's \"The Sprawl\"](https://thefader-res.cloudinary.com/private_images/w_1800,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:best/screen_shot_2016-04-20_at_21.52.37_rqwpvi/screenshot-from-i-the-sprawl-i.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Who will design *Conversations on AI*?\nWe're excited to say that editorial design for the book and for Impossible Object's future titles will be by the incredible **Metahaven**.\n\nThe work of Metahaven consists of filmmaking, writing, and design. Films by Metahaven include *The Sprawl (Propaganda about Propaganda)* (2015), *Information Skies* (2016, nominated for the 2017 European Film Awards), *Hometown* (2018), *Eurasia (Questions on Happiness)* (2018), and *Chaos Theory* (2021). Solo exhibitions include *Turnarounds*, e-flux, New York (2019), *Version History*, ICA London (2018), *Earth*, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (2018), *Hometown*, Izolyatsia, Kyiv (2018), *Information Skies*, Auto Italia, London (2016), *The Sprawl*, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco (2015), and *Islands in the Cloud*, MoMA PS1, New York (2013). Recent publications include *PSYOP: An Anthology* (Koenig Books, London, 2018), and *Digital Tarkovsky* (Strelka Press, Moscow, 2018). \n\nNot only will Metahaven be doing editorial design for *Conversations on AI*; in line with a plan that will be repeated with future Impossible Object titles, the front cover image will be minted as a standalone NFT and auctioned a little further down the line. \n\nSome of the proceeds of this will go to iODAO, Impossible Object's creator DAO.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1464387a-458e-4d20-b694-34e576c840a0.png?height=409&width=430)\n\n\n\n## How much are we aiming to raise?\n\nWe're aiming to raise up to 25 ETH. This will go to:\n\n- Our dialogists: Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester, Reza Negarestani and Nick Srnicek\n- Our designer, Metahaven\n- The costs of producing, marketing and distributing the book\n- The development of web3 functionality on Impossible Object's website and forthcoming Discord server, giving $IMPOSSIBLE holders access to the benefits that this entails.\n\n## What are the different tiers of backer rewards?\n\n**Every backer**\n- $IMPOSSIBLE tokens at the rate: 1 ETH = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE.\n- Proportional stakes in the sale of the book's NFT as described above.\n- Proportional voting power in Snapshot polls relating to the book.\n- Your name in the book's acknowledgements as one of those who supported the first ever philosophy book funded by crypto.\n\n**0.125 ETH+**\n- The above, plus...\n- Invitation to a 2hr Zoom roundtable on AI, led by Reza Negarestani and featuring participants in the book.\n\n**0.5 ETH+**\n- The above, plus...\n- Plus one invitation to the Zoom roundtable.\n- Signed special edition of the book.\n- Limited edition Impossible Object merch.\n\n**0.75 ETH+**\n- The above, plus...\n- One-of-a-kind *Conversations on AI* poster by Metahaven.\n\n**1 ETH+**\n- The above, plus...\n- A one-on-one call with Reza Negarestani on the topics covered in *Conversations on AI*.\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0b9be0ef-5b18-48c2-bb36-f3f6a864d411.png?height=493&width=634)\n\n\n\n**Futher information about the crowdfund**\n\n- The crowdfund is first come, first serve. Once it's closed, it will no longer be possible to make contributions.\n- You will need an Ethereum wallet and some ETH to participate. If you don’t have a wallet, Rainbow’s mobile app is a good option for iOS users. Alternatively, there's Metamask (iOS, Android and web).\n- 1 ETH = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE. For example, someone contributing 0.5 ETH will receive 500 $IMPOSSIBLE.\n- ETH transactions involve a transaction fee (Tx fee). The level of the Tx fee varies with the price of 'gas' on the network, which can be checked [here](https://ethgasstation.info/). If gas prices are too high, wait and try again later for a more reasonable overall Tx fee.\n- If you are new to this and need any advice, reach out on the Impossible Object [Telegram group](t.me/impossibleobject). We'll do what we can to help!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/03eff263-e1c5-452e-9700-323013ad9e5b.jpg?height=1432&width=1263)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Additional references\n\nhttps://impossible-object.io/\n\nhttps://interdependence.fm/episodes/discussing-the-essay-funded-via-essay-scissor-labels-and-hyperpop-fandoms-with-john-palmer-kara-kittel-toby-shorin-other-internet\n\nhttps://j.mirror.xyz/uVGCCwwm3k341lPpxaJmHTZROESVse9Pe_rmbiuUAC0\n\nhttps://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ\n\nhttps://generalist.mirror.xyz/1T0h7VGDcECJuifK4TPDfRoUQ3zaO_tPwdZV-dtnNqw", "timestamp": 1621973082, "digest": "hqkBkj6ttSQfHvgdArGYPNgw9JkrlLAyZqC5UWqk3s0", "contributor": "0xc46E9a66FDdC8D1a69529d86E668236f02957F1b"}

He teaches at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Music, Strelka Institute and the European Graduate School and hosts discussions with figures shaping 21st century culture on the Interdependence podcast.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d282a589-ee4b-4fc1-8a3f-5591651e2b5b.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Helen Hester** is Professor of Gender, Technology and Work at the University of West London. Her research interests include technology, social reproduction, and the future of work, and she is a member of the international feminist working group Laboria Cuboniks. Her books include *Beyond Explicit: Pornography and the Displacement of Sex* (SUNY Press, 2014), *Xenofeminism* (Polity, 2018), and *After Work: The Politics of Free Time* (Verso, 2022, with Nick Srnicek).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/088cd853-c10f-45b6-a521-c961f6b87d21.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n\n**Nick Srnicek** is a Lecturer in Digital Economy at King's College London. He is the author of *Platform Capitalism* (Polity, 2016), *Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work* (Verso, 2015 with Alex Williams).\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a9e8862-0cd7-4c28-a3d4-4a6e5ec3564a.png?height=511&width=664)\n\n\n\n## What's $IMPOSSIBLE?\n\n$IMPOSSIBLE is the token that backers of the crowdfund will receive in return for their contributions of ETH. \n\nIf you're already familiar with Mirror crowdfunds and how they differ from regular crowdfunds, that won't need any explanation. But if you're new here, here's a lil explainer:\n\n- Holding $IMPOSSIBLE tokens not only proves you helped make the book happen in the first place, but also gives you a stake in the financial success of the book.\n- Once the book is completed, the text will be minted as an NFT on Zora and put up for a reserve auction.\n\n- When the NFT sells, its smart contract funnels funds back to $IMPOSSIBLE holders in proportion to the amount of $IMPOSSIBLE they hold.\n\n-  At that point, backers can choose to sell their $IMPOSSIBLE tokens on an exchange such as Uniswap, redeeming them for ETH, or carry on holding them. Holders will receive financial upside whenever the NFT is auctioned again by future owners.\n\n- $IMPOSSIBLE holders will be able to play a governance role by taking part in Snapshot polls relating to *Conversations on AI*.\n\n- That's not all. Hold on for a full explanation of additional benefits after the jump.\n\n- This is pretty complicated, so in case it helps, please find a simplified diagram of the process below.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/033b5a4f-fbba-4432-906f-9bbbdc047376.jpg?height=1500&width=1500)\n\n\n\n\n## When will the conversations happen?\n\nAs soon as the crowdfund is over! We can't wait.\n\nAfter that, the publication of the book will occur in two stages.\n\n### Stage 1\n\nOnce the conversations have all taken place, they'll be published on Mirror as a 'beta' eBook of approximately 50,000 words – equivalent to about 200 printed pages. This will be free for all to read.\n\n### Stage 2\n\nThis is where things really start to get interesting. \n\nBefore the trade paperback is published, Impossible Object will seek responses to the dialogues from their first readership. The call for proposed responses will be open to **all** readers, not just holders of $IMPOSSIBLE. One to three of these will be published alongside the main dialogues in the first full print and electronic edition of the book, and the authors will be rewarded with $IMPOSSIBLE tokens.\n\nAlso, the names of the original backers and holders of the $IMPOSSIBLE token will be included the acknowledgements and logged forever on the blockchain in recognition of the role they played in making the book happen.\n\nPrinting commentaries and objections alongside the main text has a long tradition, stretching back before Descartes' *Meditations*. But with Mirror's help we're giving things a web3 twist.\n\n### Stage 3?\n\nOur seeking responses to the book needn't stop there. Impossible Object will retain some $IMPOSSIBLE tokens to send to authors of future responses, which would also be published in further editions on the book.\n\n\n![Still from Metahaven's \"The Sprawl\"](https://thefader-res.cloudinary.com/private_images/w_1800,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:best/screen_shot_2016-04-20_at_21.52.37_rqwpvi/screenshot-from-i-the-sprawl-i.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Who will design *Conversations on AI*?\nWe're excited to say that editorial design for the book and for Impossible Object's future titles will be by the incredible **Metahaven**.\n\nThe work of Metahaven consists of filmmaking, writing, and design. Films by Metahaven include *The Sprawl (Propaganda about Propaganda)* (2015), *Information Skies* (2016, nominated for the 2017 European Film Awards), *Hometown* (2018), *Eurasia (Questions on Happiness)* (2018), and *Chaos Theory* (2021). Solo exhibitions include *Turnarounds*, e-flux, New York (2019), *Version History*, ICA London (2018), *Earth*, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (2018), *Hometown*, Izolyatsia, Kyiv (2018), *Information Skies*, Auto Italia, London (2016), *The Sprawl*, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco (2015), and *Islands in the Cloud*, MoMA PS1, New York (2013). Recent publications include *PSYOP: An Anthology* (Koenig Books, London, 2018), and *Digital Tarkovsky* (Strelka Press, Moscow, 2018). \n\nNot only will Metahaven be doing editorial design for *Conversations on AI*; in line with a plan that will be repeated with future Impossible Object titles, the front cover image will be minted as a standalone NFT and auctioned a little further down the line. \n\nSome of the proceeds of this will go to iODAO, Impossible Object's creator DAO.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6f070e1c-e7f9-4f33-9e0e-5cde8d7859ee.png?height=600&width=430)\n\n## How much are we aiming to raise?\n\nWe're aiming to raise up to 25 ETH. This will go to:\n\n- Our dialogists: Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester, Reza Negarestani and Nick Srnicek\n- Our designer, Metahaven\n- The costs of producing, marketing and distributing the book\n- The development of web3 functionality on Impossible Object's website and forthcoming Discord server, giving $IMPOSSIBLE holders access to the benefits that this entails.\n\n## What are the different tiers of backer rewards?\n\n**Every backer**\n- $IMPOSSIBLE tokens at the rate: 1 ETH = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE.\n- Proportional stakes in the sale of the book's NFT as described above.\n- Proportional voting power in Snapshot polls relating to the book.\n- Your name in the book's acknowledgements as one of those who supported the first ever philosophy book funded by crypto.\n\n**0.125 ETH+**\n- The above, plus...\n- Invitation to a 2hr Zoom roundtable on AI, led by Reza Negarestani and featuring participants in the book.\n\n**0.5 ETH+**\n- The above, plus...\n- Plus one invitation to the Zoom roundtable.\n- Signed special edition of the book.\n- Limited edition Impossible Object merch.\n\n**0.75 ETH+**\n- The above, plus...\n- One-of-a-kind *Conversations on AI* poster by Metahaven.\n\n**1 ETH+**\n- The above, plus...\n- A one-on-one call with Reza Negarestani on the topics covered in *Conversations on AI*.\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0b9be0ef-5b18-48c2-bb36-f3f6a864d411.png?height=493&width=634)\n\n\n\n**Futher information about the crowdfund**\n\n- The crowdfund is first come, first serve. Once it's closed, it will no longer be possible to make contributions.\n- You will need an Ethereum wallet and some ETH to participate. If you don’t have a wallet, Rainbow’s mobile app is a good option for iOS users. Alternatively, there's Metamask (iOS, Android and web).\n- 1 ETH = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE. For example, someone contributing 0.5 ETH will receive 500 $IMPOSSIBLE.\n- ETH transactions involve a transaction fee (Tx fee). The level of the Tx fee varies with the price of 'gas' on the network, which can be checked [here](https://ethgasstation.info/). If gas prices are too high, wait and try again later for a more reasonable overall Tx fee.\n- If you are new to this and need any advice, reach out on the Impossible Object [Telegram group](t.me/impossibleobject).

Instructions about both can be found later in this post.\n\n[$IMPOSSIBLE: Conversations on AI](crowdfund://0x22fFc1E1Ab8e8eE937Fe05a4cBe45eD0636e47fb?network=homestead)\n\n## Let us know you backed the crowdfund!\n\nSometimes it's easy to identify backers from their Ethereum addresses; sometimes less so. When you back the project, [tweet](https://twitter.com/compose/tweet) **@im_po_ss_ib_le** to help us match you up with your contribution!\n\n## What's Impossible Object?\n\nImpossible Object's books will exist at the intersection of crypto and legacy publishing. This means we'll be publishing innovative books the old-fashioned way, as trade paperbacks and eBooks. But we're also attempting something completely new: simultaneously releasing on the blockchain so that we can use crypto's capacities to help make new kinds of book.\n\n*Conversations on AI* will be the first result of this experiment. Crypto has already provided solutions for crowdfunding [fiction](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), [science](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/41443491289334730858714141368268395642829177615924976808738423867555824271361) and [music](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM); now it's philosophy's turn. Backers of $IMPOSSIBLE will see the **first ever philosophy book funded by crypto** brought into the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3d1d3f6a-456e-48cd-8b79-5d1140227771.jpg?height=2728&width=2728)\n\n## Who's taking part in the conversations – and why are they about AI?\n\nThe initial impetus for the project was to assemble a group of pioneering thinkers so they could discuss a topic that all of their work has a stake in, and publish their discussions as a public good.\n\nThat group ended up comprising **Reza Negarestani, Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester and Nick Srnicek**. And the topic that turned out to unite their interests was Artificial Intelligence. \n\nThese thinkers have previously dealt with AI from various angles: some have written about AI directly (Reza Negarestani's *Intelligence and Spirit* and Nick Srnicek's work on the political economy of AI), some engage with AI as a collaborator (Holly Herndon, Mat Dryhurst and SPAWN), while some have developed the notion of artificiality in itself as a means out of conceptual deadlock (Helen Hester and Benjamin Bratton).\n\nIn the three conversations on the topic, AI will act more as a crossroads than the sole focus. Our dialogists are fascinated by the impact that AI will have on politics, art, philosophy, education, terraforming, and many more things, meaning that although the dialogues may consistently pass through AI, they will almost certainly end up at surprising destinations.\n\nAnd in what way is this a 'new kind of book'? First, as mentioned already, it's the first ever philosophy book funded by crypto. Second, we will use the $IMPOSSIBLE token to steer the book through at least two distinct editions. After the first 'beta' edition, we will seek responses to the dialogues, which will be rewarded with $IMPOSSIBLE and published in all later editions. \n\nThis book will not be a static object, but instead a fluid one that uses the decentralised logic of the blockchain to open up new possibilities for collaboration.  More on all of this below.\n\nReza and Impossible Object's short essay on the themes of *Conversations on AI* can be found [here](https://r.mirror.xyz/zghnOjS2aVlowlZ5D7ocnswHVSLSe04ZG-ubaMFBHmI).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3650eb7b-b2d7-405a-833e-e96ab8ae0adc.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Reza Negarestani** is a philosopher and a former systems engineer. He originally became known for pioneering his pioneering work of theory-fiction *Cyclonopedia* (2008). Since the early 2000s, he has contributed extensively to journals and anthologies, and lectured at numerous international universities and institutes including Duke University, MIT, École Normale Supérieure, and Haus der Kulturen der Welt among others. Negarestani’s writings have been translated into twelve languages. Negarestani’s latest philosophical work is *Intelligence and Spirit*(Urbanomic/Sequence Press/MIT, 2018), a book investigating the meaning of intelligence at the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, theory of computation and the philosophy of German Idealism.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/36c1d3cb-b3d1-4273-85f4-ece4dbedcd0c.png?height=700&width=500)\n\n**Benjamin Bratton's** work spans Philosophy, Art, Design and Computer Science. He is Professor of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego. He is Program Director of The Terraforming programme at Strelka Institute of Media, Architecture and Design in Moscow. He is also a Visiting Professor at The European Graduate School,  SCI_Arc (The Southern California Institute of Architecture) and NYU Shanghai. He is the author of several books including *The Revenge of The Real: Politics for a Post-Pandemic World *(Verso, 2021) and *The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty*  (MIT Press, 2015).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5cb5a2e-846b-429c-b790-33688ae2084f.png?height=400&width=650)\n\n**Holly Herndon** operates at the edge of electronic and avant-garde pop music and emerges with a dynamic and disruptive canon of her own. On her most recent full-length album *PROTO* Herndon fronts and conducts an electronic pop choir comprised of both human and AI voices over a musical palette that encompasses everything from synths to Sacred Harp stylings. CNN noted that Herndon is 'shaping the future of AI' and she has demonstrated this nexus of technological evolution and musical catharsis with elevated performances at The Barbican (London), Volksbühne (Berlin), Sónar (Barcelona), Unsound (Krakow), and Club 2 Club (Milan). The sounds synthesized on PROTO by Herndon, her AI “baby” Spawn, and the vocal ensemble combine elements from Herndon’s dynamic and idiosyncratic personal journey: the timeless folk traditions of her childhood experiences in church-going East Tennessee (particularly the prismatic layered practice of Sacred Harp singing), the avant-garde music she explored while at Mills College, and the radical club culture of Berlin, all enhanced by her recent PhD composition studies at Stanford University, researching machine learning and music. Herndon co-founded the podcast series Interdependence alongside Mat Dryhurst.\n\n**Mat Dryhurst** releases music, research and artworks solo and in conjunction with creative partner Holly Herndon.

Copyright Eames Office LLC.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3cd2022e-2df3-41e1-8322-47717aa08c1d.jpeg?height=1046&width=1568)\n\nComplex landscapes are defined by their multi-level structures. They demand us to navigate them across different scales, to see and approach them not as monolithic phenomena but as deep objects which progressively push us to engineer better toolboxes of techniques to interact with them. The concept of intelligence invokes precisely one such complex landscape whose navigation calls at once for open-ended exploration and careful development of new ways of knowing and practice.\n\nCharles and Ray Eames’ classic short film *Powers of Ten* begins with a couple enjoying a picnic. This is what we can call the familiar picture of things broadly understood. Thus, the initial point of the story takes place at a scale we are already inhabiting in our ordinary and quotidian picture of the world. We can call this the scale zero of any terrestrial story.\n\nThe film then scales up this familiar picture every ten seconds, from one square meter to ten square meters, then one hundred and then one thousand, until it reaches 100 million light years. By this simple procedure of adding a zero to our index of scale-length every ten seconds, we soon find ourselves at the brink of an empty universe littered with scanty piles of dust that we call galaxies. \n\nThe film then reverses direction and hurtles back towards the couples at the Michigan lakeside. This time we scale down from a patch of the man’s skin to the scale of elementary particles and scales for which we have not yet developed robust and confirmed theories of physics. \n\n![Stills from \"Powers of Ten\". Copyright Eames Office LLC.](http://shazwanyaziz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Powers_of_Ten_Film_Stills_Final.png)\n\nThis instance of scaling up and down from the ordinary picture of ourselves to which we are accustomed to a scale where the concept of the human must be invented anew coincides with the obligation of forging new ways of looking at the meaning of our place in the world broadly understood. \n\nAs we move up and down in terms of scales, we no longer see ourselves as this or that sort of species, for our conception of ourselves as a part of the world constantly changes, a change that requires new concepts and vocabularies, new ways of knowing and worldmaking, and by extension revised theoretical and practical commitments to the word and to ourselves.\n\nThe aim of *Conversations on AI* is to pursue a series of discussions with a simple premise. We will begin by talking about artificial intelligence and general intelligence as we know them today. This is the scale zero of our dialogue. From our ordinary understanding of intelligence, we can move up and down the scales. We will assess the idea of AI and general intelligence at political, artistic and trans-generational levels as we travel higher in scales. At the same time, we’ll begin to talk about intelligence at lower scales such as neural and biochemical levels. Our commitment is to nothing but drastic shifts in perspective when it comes to talking about intelligence. \n\nSuch changes of perspective demand us to engineer new concepts — more refined, more fruitful and more robust — for the scale at which we address the problems. Conceptual engineering that replaces or repairs our everyday concepts with better ones will be a guiding principle in our exploration.\n\nAll in all, this book promises to deal with the questions of artificial intelligence and general intelligence using a host of different perspectives at different scales, from the question of modeling complex phenomena to planetary-scale engineering, education and global pedagogy, trans-generational politics to the intersection of the computational mind and the social mind.\n\nWhat happens when the social account of mind meets the computational account of mind, when we realize that we have always been artifacts of our decisions, thoughts and actions, whether directly or through the systems in which they have now been entrenched?\n\n**Click here to be taken back to the *Conversations on AI* crowdfund:**\n\nhttps://r.mirror.xyz/hqkBkj6ttSQfHvgdArGYPNgw9JkrlLAyZqC5UWqk3s0\n\n**Impossible Object publishes innovative books and uses a blend of legacy and crypto workflows to create new kinds of book.**\n\nhttps://impossible-object.io/\n\n**Reza Negarestani is a philosopher and a former systems engineer.

Instructions about both can be found later in this post.\n\n[$IMPOSSIBLE: Conversations on AI](crowdfund://0x22fFc1E1Ab8e8eE937Fe05a4cBe45eD0636e47fb?network=homestead)\n\n## Let us know you backed the crowdfund!\n\nSometimes it's easy to identify backers from their Ethereum addresses; sometimes less so.

This means we'll be publishing innovative books the old-fashioned way, as trade paperbacks and eBooks. But we're also attempting something completely new: simultaneously releasing on the blockchain so that we can use crypto's capacities to help make new kinds of book.\n\n*Conversations on AI* will be the first result of this experiment. Crypto has already provided solutions for crowdfunding [fiction](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), [science](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/41443491289334730858714141368268395642829177615924976808738423867555824271361) and [music](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM); now it's philosophy's turn.

And the topic that turned out to unite their interests was Artificial Intelligence. \n\nThese thinkers have previously dealt with AI from various angles: some have written about AI directly (Reza Negarestani's *Intelligence and Spirit* and Nick Srnicek's work on the political economy of AI), some engage with AI as a collaborator (Holly Herndon, Mat Dryhurst and SPAWN), while some have developed the notion of artificiality in itself as a means out of conceptual deadlock (Helen Hester and Benjamin Bratton).\n\nIn the three conversations on the topic, AI will act more as a crossroads than the sole focus. Our dialogists are fascinated by the impact that AI will have on politics, art, philosophy, education, terraforming, and many more things, meaning that although the dialogues may consistently pass through AI, they will almost certainly end up at surprising destinations.\n\nAnd in what way is this a 'new kind of book'? First, as mentioned already, it's the first ever philosophy book funded by crypto. Second, we will use the $IMPOSSIBLE token to steer the book through at least two distinct editions. After the first 'beta' edition, we will seek responses to the dialogues, which will be rewarded with $IMPOSSIBLE and published in all later editions. \n\nThis book will not be a static object, but instead a fluid one that uses the decentralised logic of the blockchain to open up new possibilities for collaboration.  More on all of this below.\n\nReza and Impossible Object's short essay on the themes of *Conversations on AI* can be found [here](https://r.mirror.xyz/zghnOjS2aVlowlZ5D7ocnswHVSLSe04ZG-ubaMFBHmI).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3650eb7b-b2d7-405a-833e-e96ab8ae0adc.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Reza Negarestani** is a philosopher and a former systems engineer. He originally became known for pioneering his pioneering work of theory-fiction *Cyclonopedia* (2008). Since the early 2000s, he has contributed extensively to journals and anthologies, and lectured at numerous international universities and institutes including Duke University, MIT, École Normale Supérieure, and Haus der Kulturen der Welt among others. Negarestani’s writings have been translated into twelve languages. Negarestani’s latest philosophical work is *Intelligence and Spirit*(Urbanomic/Sequence Press/MIT, 2018), a book investigating the meaning of intelligence at the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, theory of computation and the philosophy of German Idealism.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/36c1d3cb-b3d1-4273-85f4-ece4dbedcd0c.png?height=700&width=500)\n\n**Benjamin Bratton's** work spans Philosophy, Art, Design and Computer Science. He is Professor of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego. He is Program Director of The Terraforming programme at Strelka Institute of Media, Architecture and Design in Moscow. He is also a Visiting Professor at The European Graduate School,  SCI_Arc (The Southern California Institute of Architecture) and NYU Shanghai. He is the author of several books including *The Revenge of The Real: Politics for a Post-Pandemic World *(Verso, 2021) and *The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty*  (MIT Press, 2015).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5cb5a2e-846b-429c-b790-33688ae2084f.png?height=400&width=650)\n\n**Holly Herndon** operates at the edge of electronic and avant-garde pop music and emerges with a dynamic and disruptive canon of her own. On her most recent full-length album *PROTO* Herndon fronts and conducts an electronic pop choir comprised of both human and AI voices over a musical palette that encompasses everything from synths to Sacred Harp stylings. CNN noted that Herndon is 'shaping the future of AI' and she has demonstrated this nexus of technological evolution and musical catharsis with elevated performances at The Barbican (London), Volksbühne (Berlin), Sónar (Barcelona), Unsound (Krakow), and Club 2 Club (Milan). The sounds synthesized on PROTO by Herndon, her AI “baby” Spawn, and the vocal ensemble combine elements from Herndon’s dynamic and idiosyncratic personal journey: the timeless folk traditions of her childhood experiences in church-going East Tennessee (particularly the prismatic layered practice of Sacred Harp singing), the avant-garde music she explored while at Mills College, and the radical club culture of Berlin, all enhanced by her recent PhD composition studies at Stanford University, researching machine learning and music. Herndon co-founded the podcast series Interdependence alongside Mat Dryhurst.\n\n**Mat Dryhurst** releases music, research and artworks solo and in conjunction with creative partner Holly Herndon. He teaches at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Music, Strelka Institute and the European Graduate School and hosts discussions with figures shaping 21st century culture on the Interdependence podcast.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d282a589-ee4b-4fc1-8a3f-5591651e2b5b.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Helen Hester** is Professor of Gender, Technology and Work at the University of West London. Her research interests include technology, social reproduction, and the future of work, and she is a member of the international feminist working group Laboria Cuboniks. Her books include *Beyond Explicit: Pornography and the Displacement of Sex* (SUNY Press, 2014), *Xenofeminism* (Polity, 2018), and *After Work: The Politics of Free Time* (Verso, 2022, with Nick Srnicek).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/088cd853-c10f-45b6-a521-c961f6b87d21.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n\n**Nick Srnicek** is a Lecturer in Digital Economy at King's College London. He is the author of *Platform Capitalism* (Polity, 2016), *Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work* (Verso, 2015 with Alex Williams).\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a9e8862-0cd7-4c28-a3d4-4a6e5ec3564a.png?height=511&width=664)\n\n\n\n## What's $IMPOSSIBLE?\n\n$IMPOSSIBLE is the token that backers of the crowdfund will receive in return for their contributions of ETH. \n\nIf you're already familiar with Mirror crowdfunds and how they differ from regular crowdfunds, that won't need any explanation. But if you're new here, here's a lil explainer:\n\n- Holding $IMPOSSIBLE tokens not only proves you helped make the book happen in the first place, but also gives you a stake in the financial success of the book.\n- Once the book is completed, the text will be minted as an NFT on Zora and put up for a reserve auction.\n\n- When the NFT sells, its smart contract funnels funds back to $IMPOSSIBLE holders in proportion to the amount of $IMPOSSIBLE they hold.\n\n-  At that point, backers can choose to sell their $IMPOSSIBLE tokens on an exchange such as Uniswap, redeeming them for ETH, or carry on holding them. Holders will receive financial upside whenever the NFT is auctioned again by future owners.\n\n- $IMPOSSIBLE holders will be able to play a governance role by taking part in Snapshot polls relating to *Conversations on AI*.\n\n- That's not all. Hold on for a full explanation of additional benefits after the jump.\n\n- This is pretty complicated, so in case it helps, please find a simplified diagram of the process below.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/033b5a4f-fbba-4432-906f-9bbbdc047376.jpg?height=1500&width=1500)\n\n\n\n\n## When will the conversations happen?\n\nAs soon as the crowdfund is over! We can't wait.\n\nAfter that, the publication of the book will occur in two stages.\n\n### Stage 1\n\nOnce the conversations have all taken place, they'll be published on Mirror as a 'beta' eBook of approximately 50,000 words – equivalent to about 200 printed pages. This will be free for all to read.\n\n### Stage 2\n\nThis is where things really start to get interesting. \n\nBefore the trade paperback is published, Impossible Object will seek responses to the dialogues from their first readership. The call for proposed responses will be open to **all** readers, not just holders of $IMPOSSIBLE. One to three of these will be published alongside the main dialogues in the first full print and electronic edition of the book, and the authors will be rewarded with $IMPOSSIBLE tokens.\n\nAlso, the names of the original backers and holders of the $IMPOSSIBLE token will be included the acknowledgements and logged forever on the blockchain in recognition of the role they played in making the book happen.\n\nPrinting commentaries and objections alongside the main text has a long tradition, stretching back before Descartes' *Meditations*. But with Mirror's help we're giving things a web3 twist.\n\n### Stage 3?\n\nOur seeking responses to the book needn't stop there. Impossible Object will retain some $IMPOSSIBLE tokens to send to authors of future responses, which would also be published in further editions on the book.\n\n\n![Still from Metahaven's \"The Sprawl\"](https://thefader-res.cloudinary.com/private_images/w_1800,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:best/screen_shot_2016-04-20_at_21.52.37_rqwpvi/screenshot-from-i-the-sprawl-i.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Who will design *Conversations on AI*?\nWe're excited to say that editorial design for the book and for Impossible Object's future titles will be by the incredible **Metahaven**.\n\nThe work of Metahaven consists of filmmaking, writing, and design. Films by Metahaven include *The Sprawl (Propaganda about Propaganda)* (2015), *Information Skies* (2016, nominated for the 2017 European Film Awards), *Hometown* (2018), *Eurasia (Questions on Happiness)* (2018), and *Chaos Theory* (2021). Solo exhibitions include *Turnarounds*, e-flux, New York (2019), *Version History*, ICA London (2018), *Earth*, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (2018), *Hometown*, Izolyatsia, Kyiv (2018), *Information Skies*, Auto Italia, London (2016), *The Sprawl*, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco (2015), and *Islands in the Cloud*, MoMA PS1, New York (2013). Recent publications include *PSYOP: An Anthology* (Koenig Books, London, 2018), and *Digital Tarkovsky* (Strelka Press, Moscow, 2018). \n\nNot only will Metahaven be doing editorial design for *Conversations on AI*; in line with a plan that will be repeated with future Impossible Object titles, the front cover image will be minted as a standalone NFT and auctioned a little further down the line. \n\nSome of the proceeds of this will go to iODAO, Impossible Object's creator DAO.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6f070e1c-e7f9-4f33-9e0e-5cde8d7859ee.png?height=600&width=430)\n\n## How much are we aiming to raise?\n\nWe're aiming to raise up to 25 ETH. This will go to:\n\n- Our dialogists: Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester, Reza Negarestani and Nick Srnicek\n- Our designer, Metahaven\n- The costs of producing, marketing and distributing the book\n- The development of web3 functionality on Impossible Object's website and forthcoming Discord server, giving $IMPOSSIBLE holders access to the benefits that this entails.\n\n## What are the different tiers of backer rewards?\n\n**Every backer**\n- $IMPOSSIBLE tokens at the rate: 1 ETH = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE.\n- Proportional stakes in the sale of the book's NFT as described above.\n- Proportional voting power in Snapshot polls relating to the book.\n- Your name in the book's acknowledgements as one of those who supported the first ever philosophy book funded by crypto.\n\n**0.125 ETH+**\n- The above, plus...\n- Invitation to a 2hr Zoom roundtable on AI, led by Reza Negarestani and featuring participants in the book.\n\n**0.5 ETH+**\n- The above, plus...\n- Plus one invitation to the Zoom roundtable.\n- Signed special edition of the book.\n- Limited edition Impossible Object merch.\n\n**0.75 ETH+**\n- The above, plus...\n- One-of-a-kind *Conversations on AI* poster by Metahaven.\n\n**1 ETH+**\n- The above, plus...\n- A one-on-one call with Reza Negarestani on the topics covered in *Conversations on AI*.\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0b9be0ef-5b18-48c2-bb36-f3f6a864d411.png?height=493&width=634)\n\n\n\n**Futher information about the crowdfund**\n\n- The crowdfund is first come, first serve. Once it's closed, it will no longer be possible to make contributions.\n- You will need an Ethereum wallet and some ETH to participate. If you don’t have a wallet, Rainbow’s mobile app is a good option for iOS users. Alternatively, there's Metamask (iOS, Android and web).\n- 1 ETH = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE. For example, someone contributing 0.5 ETH will receive 500 $IMPOSSIBLE.\n- ETH transactions involve a transaction fee (Tx fee). The level of the Tx fee varies with the price of 'gas' on the network, which can be checked [here](https://ethgasstation.info/). If gas prices are too high, wait and try again later for a more reasonable overall Tx fee.\n- If you are new to this and need any advice, reach out on the Impossible Object [Telegram group](t.me/impossibleobject).

Negarestani’s writings have been translated into twelve languages. Negarestani’s latest philosophical work is *Intelligence and Spirit*(Urbanomic/Sequence Press/MIT, 2018), a book investigating the meaning of intelligence at the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, theory of computation and the philosophy of German Idealism.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/36c1d3cb-b3d1-4273-85f4-ece4dbedcd0c.png?height=700&width=500)\n\n**Benjamin Bratton's** work spans Philosophy, Art, Design and Computer Science. He is Professor of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego. He is Program Director of The Terraforming programme at Strelka Institute of Media, Architecture and Design in Moscow. He is also a Visiting Professor at The European Graduate School,  SCI_Arc (The Southern California Institute of Architecture) and NYU Shanghai. He is the author of several books including *The Revenge of The Real: Politics for a Post-Pandemic World* (Verso, 2021) and *The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty*  (MIT Press, 2015).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5cb5a2e-846b-429c-b790-33688ae2084f.png?height=400&width=650)\n\n**Holly Herndon** operates at the edge of electronic and avant-garde pop music and emerges with a dynamic and disruptive canon of her own. On her most recent full-length album *PROTO* Herndon fronts and conducts an electronic pop choir comprised of both human and AI voices over a musical palette that encompasses everything from synths to Sacred Harp stylings. CNN noted that Herndon is 'shaping the future of AI' and she has demonstrated this nexus of technological evolution and musical catharsis with elevated performances at The Barbican (London), Volksbühne (Berlin), Sónar (Barcelona), Unsound (Krakow), and Club 2 Club (Milan). The sounds synthesized on PROTO by Herndon, her AI “baby” Spawn, and the vocal ensemble combine elements from Herndon’s dynamic and idiosyncratic personal journey: the timeless folk traditions of her childhood experiences in church-going East Tennessee (particularly the prismatic layered practice of Sacred Harp singing), the avant-garde music she explored while at Mills College, and the radical club culture of Berlin, all enhanced by her recent PhD composition studies at Stanford University, researching machine learning and music. Herndon co-founded the podcast series Interdependence alongside Mat Dryhurst.\n\n**Mat Dryhurst** releases music, research and artworks solo and in conjunction with creative partner Holly Herndon. He teaches at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Music, Strelka Institute and the European Graduate School and hosts discussions with figures shaping 21st century culture on the Interdependence podcast.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d282a589-ee4b-4fc1-8a3f-5591651e2b5b.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Helen Hester** is Professor of Gender, Technology and Work at the University of West London. Her research interests include technology, social reproduction, and the future of work, and she is a member of the international feminist working group Laboria Cuboniks. Her books include *Beyond Explicit: Pornography and the Displacement of Sex* (SUNY Press, 2014), *Xenofeminism* (Polity, 2018), and *After Work: The Politics of Free Time* (Verso, 2022, with Nick Srnicek).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/088cd853-c10f-45b6-a521-c961f6b87d21.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n\n**Nick Srnicek** is a Lecturer in Digital Economy at King's College London. He is the author of *Platform Capitalism* (Polity, 2016), *Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work* (Verso, 2015 with Alex Williams).\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a9e8862-0cd7-4c28-a3d4-4a6e5ec3564a.png?height=511&width=664)\n\n\n\n## What's $IMPOSSIBLE?\n\n$IMPOSSIBLE is the token that backers of the crowdfund will receive in return for their contributions of ETH. \n\nIf you're already familiar with Mirror crowdfunds and how they differ from regular crowdfunds, that won't need any explanation. But if you're new here, here's a lil explainer:\n\n- Holding $IMPOSSIBLE tokens not only proves you helped make the book happen in the first place, but also gives you a stake in the financial success of the book.\n- Once the book is completed, the text will be minted as an NFT on Zora and put up for a reserve auction.\n\n- When the NFT sells, its smart contract funnels funds back to $IMPOSSIBLE holders in proportion to the amount of $IMPOSSIBLE they hold.\n\n-  At that point, backers can choose to sell their $IMPOSSIBLE tokens on an exchange such as Uniswap, redeeming them for ETH, or carry on holding them. Holders will receive financial upside whenever the NFT is auctioned again by future owners.\n\n- $IMPOSSIBLE holders will be able to play a governance role by taking part in Snapshot polls relating to *Conversations on AI*.\n\n- That's not all. Hold on for a full explanation of additional benefits after the jump.\n\n- This is pretty complicated, so in case it helps, please find a simplified diagram of the process below.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/033b5a4f-fbba-4432-906f-9bbbdc047376.jpg?height=1500&width=1500)\n\n\n\n\n## When will the conversations happen?\n\nAs soon as the crowdfund is over! We can't wait.\n\nAfter that, the publication of the book will occur in two stages.\n\n### Stage 1\n\nOnce the conversations have all taken place, they'll be published on Mirror as a 'beta' eBook of approximately 50,000 words – equivalent to about 200 printed pages. This will be free for all to read.\n\n### Stage 2\n\nThis is where things really start to get interesting. \n\nBefore the trade paperback is published, Impossible Object will seek responses to the dialogues from their first readership. The call for proposed responses will be open to **all** readers, not just holders of $IMPOSSIBLE. One to three of these will be published alongside the main dialogues in the first full print and electronic edition of the book, and the authors will be rewarded with $IMPOSSIBLE tokens.\n\nAlso, the names of the original backers and holders of the $IMPOSSIBLE token will be included the acknowledgements and logged forever on the blockchain in recognition of the role they played in making the book happen.\n\nPrinting commentaries and objections alongside the main text has a long tradition, stretching back before Descartes' *Meditations*. But with Mirror's help we're giving things a web3 twist.\n\n### Stage 3?\n\nOur seeking responses to the book needn't stop there. Impossible Object will retain some $IMPOSSIBLE tokens to send to authors of future responses, which would also be published in further editions on the book.\n\n\n![Still from Metahaven's \"The Sprawl\"](https://thefader-res.cloudinary.com/private_images/w_1800,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:best/screen_shot_2016-04-20_at_21.52.37_rqwpvi/screenshot-from-i-the-sprawl-i.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Who will design *Conversations on AI*?\nWe're excited to say that editorial design for the book and for Impossible Object's future titles will be by the incredible **Metahaven**.\n\nThe work of Metahaven consists of filmmaking, writing, and design. Films by Metahaven include *The Sprawl (Propaganda about Propaganda)* (2015), *Information Skies* (2016, nominated for the 2017 European Film Awards), *Hometown* (2018), *Eurasia (Questions on Happiness)* (2018), and *Chaos Theory* (2021). Solo exhibitions include *Turnarounds*, e-flux, New York (2019), *Version History*, ICA London (2018), *Earth*, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (2018), *Hometown*, Izolyatsia, Kyiv (2018), *Information Skies*, Auto Italia, London (2016), *The Sprawl*, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco (2015), and *Islands in the Cloud*, MoMA PS1, New York (2013). Recent publications include *PSYOP: An Anthology* (Koenig Books, London, 2018), and *Digital Tarkovsky* (Strelka Press, Moscow, 2018). \n\nNot only will Metahaven be doing editorial design for *Conversations on AI*; in line with a plan that will be repeated with future Impossible Object titles, the front cover image will be minted as a standalone NFT and auctioned a little further down the line. \n\nSome of the proceeds of this will go to iODAO, Impossible Object's creator DAO.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6f070e1c-e7f9-4f33-9e0e-5cde8d7859ee.png?height=600&width=430)\n\n## How much are we aiming to raise?\n\nWe're aiming to raise up to 25 ETH. This will go to:\n\n- Our dialogists: Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester, Reza Negarestani and Nick Srnicek\n- Our designer, Metahaven\n- The costs of producing, marketing and distributing the book\n- The development of web3 functionality on Impossible Object's website and forthcoming Discord server, giving $IMPOSSIBLE holders access to the benefits that this entails.\n\n## What are the different tiers of backer rewards?\n\n**Every backer**\n- $IMPOSSIBLE tokens at the rate: 1 ETH = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE.\n- Proportional stakes in the sale of the book's NFT as described above.\n- Proportional voting power in Snapshot polls relating to the book.\n- Your name in the book's acknowledgements as one of those who supported the first ever philosophy book funded by crypto.\n\n**0.125 ETH+**\n- The above, plus...\n- Invitation to a 2hr Zoom roundtable on AI, led by Reza Negarestani and featuring participants in the book.\n\n**0.5 ETH+**\n- The above, plus...\n- Plus one invitation to the Zoom roundtable.\n- Signed special edition of the book.\n- Limited edition Impossible Object merch.\n\n**0.75 ETH+**\n- The above, plus...\n- One-of-a-kind *Conversations on AI* poster by Metahaven.\n\n**1 ETH+**\n- The above, plus...\n- A one-on-one call with Reza Negarestani on the topics covered in *Conversations on AI*.\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0b9be0ef-5b18-48c2-bb36-f3f6a864d411.png?height=493&width=634)\n\n\n\n**Futher information about the crowdfund**\n\n- The crowdfund is first come, first serve. Once it's closed, it will no longer be possible to make contributions.\n- You will need an Ethereum wallet and some ETH to participate. If you don’t have a wallet, Rainbow’s mobile app is a good option for iOS users. Alternatively, there's Metamask (iOS, Android and web).\n- 1 ETH = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE. For example, someone contributing 0.5 ETH will receive 500 $IMPOSSIBLE.\n- ETH transactions involve a transaction fee (Tx fee). The level of the Tx fee varies with the price of 'gas' on the network, which can be checked [here](https://ethgasstation.info/). If gas prices are too high, wait and try again later for a more reasonable overall Tx fee.\n- If you are new to this and need any advice, reach out on the Impossible Object [Telegram group](t.me/impossibleobject).

{"id": "RQyPELZP8ZSJ_948fW9sc_TvJk31KKwpfSQ5UfPlRWs", "title": "Crowdfunding creator residencies at our $CABIN", "body": "\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/93235881-62bb-43e6-9c03-3cf84317a0a7.JPG?height=1365&width=2048)\n\nOver the past few weeks, a group of independent online creators have been living at a [cabin retreat](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) outside of Austin, TX and asking ourselves:\n\n> ## What could our community do with a year of time and space to create?\n\nWe want to bring more people out to the cabins to help answer the question, so we're starting a creator residency program. It's an experiment in [universal creator income](https://li.substack.com/p/the-case-for-universal-creative-income), [tech stacks for decentralized cities](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4), and the physical [manifestation of DAOs](https://twitter.com/jongold/status/1395390112205352962?s=20).\n\n\n[CabinDAO](crowdfund://0x94515e4f6fabad73C8bCdd8cd42f0b5C037E2c49?network=homestead)\n\n\nThis is a crowdfund for one year of cumulative time living and building at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) in the Texas Hill Country. We're situated on 28 acres of land about 45 minutes from downtown Austin, and we just built a new cabin designed as a collaborative co-living and working space for independent online creators. Our cabins are the first nodes in what we hope will one day be a [decentralized city](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/decentralized-cities/):\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aff070f7-1ccb-4868-8a53-64505c093fee.jpg?height=1174&width=1710)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f7f4c3a9-0d4d-4403-8a28-23432eb32a98.jpg?height=1286&width=1954)\n\n[The land & cabins are our hardware](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4). Now we're starting to experiment with on-chain governance software. We will set up CabinDAO to manage this crowdfund. All contributors will be awarded $CABIN tokens, which can be used to vote for creator residency proposals. While the DAO will ultimately govern the use of the funds, here's a rough sketch of how we are thinking about structuring the program:\n\n## CabinDAO\n\nWe want to crowdfund 12 months' worth of time at the cabins. This would allow $CABIN holders to vote and fund 12 creators to come for a one-month stay each. The new cabin has four bedrooms, so we would run three cohorts of four creators each.\n\nThe DAO will set up an open application process, perhaps similar to $WRITE RACE. Winners will be invited to Creator Cabins outside of Austin, TX to work on their projects——or ride the waves of synchronicity & decide to collaborate. \n\nAt the end of the month, we will help each creator mint an NFT representing their work at the residency. Our intention is for the CabinDAO community (IRL in Texas, and globally on Discord) to help creators best use emergent web3 patterns to collaborate and share their work.\n\nWhile the first use-case for this DAO is creator residencies, we hope to learn from this experiment and continue to find ways to sustainably fund independent online creators and develop DAO-based governance models for physical spaces. CabinDAO community adds a node to an interdependent network of the new Creator Economy. The edges of CabinDAO are permeable and open to all forms of contribution. We're especially excited about mutually beneficial web3 native collaborations with other DAOs working toward similar visions.\n\nThis project came together over the course of a two-week stay at Creator Cabins by members of [creator.coop](https://creator.coop). We didn't go into our stay intending to make this——the plan emerged from two weeks of co-working, co-living, and co-creating at the cabins. \n\nEveryone came into their time at the cabins with projects they wanted to finish, but late-night conversations around the fire got us all inspired to think about opening the space up to the whole community, regardless of financial means. We hope the residency program can help inspire more collaborative, community-oriented projects like this one.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2c1549c9-0d03-4b4e-914c-d50f07800d22.jpg?height=1284&width=1932)\n\n\n## FAQs\n\n### How do I contribute?\n\nUsing Mirror's widget embedded in this post, you can send ETH to CabinDAO's crowdfund. All contributors will be awarded $CABIN tokens and invited to our Discord community to begin putting together the plan to fund residencies. Contributions are capped at 2 ETH to maximize participation and ensure balanced governance.\n\n\n### Who is eligible for a residency?\n\nAnyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of the term “creator”: digital artists, musicians, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders. If you’re building something that you hope to share back with the world, then you probably fit the bill. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide.\n\n\n### How do I apply for a residency? \n\nOnce the crowdfund is complete, the DAO will run an open process for selecting applicants. [If you're interested in being notified about that process, opt-in here](https://creatorcabins.ck.page/9e628caec5).\n\n\n### How will the money be spent?\n\nAll money raised by the DAO will be used to fund residencies at Creator Cabins. We are budgeting 1/2th of an ETH per creator-week, so 24 ETH can fund 3 cohorts (12 creators for 4 weeks each the cabins). This provides enough funding for room, board, and services to support creators during their stay.\n\n\n### How will the DAO sustain itself?\n\nAt the end of each residency, we will help creators mint an NFT representing their work. The NFTs could be held and curated by the CabinDAO treasury or sold back to the community with a split of the proceeds going to the artist and the DAO. \n\nWe hope this structure can help produce value for the community and creator residents while contributing to the long-term sustainability of this model. This is a patronage project designed to provide the gift of time and space to our community. Contributors to the DAO should not expect any financial return.\n\n\n### What happens with the other 50% of $CABIN?\n\nCabinDAO will retain 50% of $CABIN tokens to give to artists upon completion of their residencies, collaborators, other communally beneficial DAOs, future supporters of the residency program, and whoever else CabinDAO decides to grant them to.\n\n\n### Is this co-ownership in the cabins?\n\nNo. CabinDAO is a separate entity, managing the endowment of our creative residency program. This is our first experiment with web3 governance, and we hope to use the lessons from this project to progressively decentralize other aspects of this project in the future.\n\n\n### Why IRL?\n\nThis project never would have happened without the open-ended space to explore and collaborate IRL. It emerged from late-night conversations at the cabin where we are hosting this residency. \n\nAfter a year of pandemic, we had forgotten some of the magical energy of open-ended living and working with other people. You don't need to schedule a Zoom call with an agenda and a hard stop after 30 minutes. As you're drinking your morning coffee, you can end up down a rabbit hole, swapping book recommendations, productivity tools, and podcast episodes. The result: great conversations, deepened friendships, and exciting new ideas.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1df7adbe-3a5c-49e0-95f2-d9af9e8c364e.jpg?height=1298&width=1946)\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/27723c84-ba7e-4cf2-b133-6b843455ecd1.jpg?height=1284&width=1950)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2a3ce5da-5f6d-4ce6-974a-83006b9ddcd4.jpg?height=1308&width=1960)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/39edd82a-9a14-4f91-9442-79e59c11eb5b.jpg?height=1292&width=1940)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8aca6bb-3fd6-457a-987e-c606089a5907.jpg?height=1254&width=1932)\n\n\n[CabinDAO](crowdfund://0x94515e4f6fabad73C8bCdd8cd42f0b5C037E2c49?network=homestead)\n\n\n\n**Acknowledgements** \n\n*Our ideas are building on the prior art, shared learnings & enlightening conversations we’ve had with many others over the past few months.*\n\n*Thanks to @patrickxrivera, @thattallguy, @sirsuhayb, @js_horne, @ljin18, @drewcoffman, and @jarroddicker for talking through the initial idea and helping set up the right structure for this project.*\n\n*Thanks to Seed Club, Songcamp, PartyDAO, herstoryDAO, and the Mint Fund for feedback, inspiration, and advice.*\n\n*Thanks to @p_millerd and @kadlac for being the first people to contribute funds when this was still just an idea.*\n\n*Thanks to @brianwlackey for the beautiful photography in this post.*", "timestamp": 1621976831, "digest": "20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}
