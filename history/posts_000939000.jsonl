{"id": "IxxgXO2pjIQXLAfxdY2G794LELmxktXfyySJcL0qBPc", "title": "My Dream for the Planet School", "body": "Last week, I stepped off the *SSV* (Sailing School Vessel) *Corwith Cramer* after spending six weeks at sea as the 3rd Mate for “Marine Biodiversity & Conservation,” a college semester-at-sea program run by the Sea Education Association (SEA)*.* Coming aboard in Key West, Florida seven weeks ago marked 14 years since I had stepped onto *Cramer* as a student myself. I had never been sailing before and I had no idea how profoundly that voyage would impact me. They say that the sea is a great teacher and I agree, but the community we intentionally create at sea deserves description too.\n\nAn isolated ship at sea is, in many ways, an ideal medium for creating deeply impactful learning opportunities. For this inaugural Planet School blog post, I want to share why I love to teach at sea and how the core elements of an ocean-based curriculum do not actually need to be unique to the sea at all. To do that, I need to give a bit of background on what it means to go sailing for a semester on a tall ship.\n\n![Removing the crutch of GPS and navigating with the stars is yet another opportunity for authentic student agency.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2czv-EUWimA9Q8y4l-iNF.jpeg?height=450&width=600)\n\nMake no mistake: sailing is hard work. I suspect that many students, like me when I was 20 years old, perceive a semester aboard a sailboat as one of relaxing exoticism bordering on luxuriousness: perfect sunsets, dolphins chasing the bow, strumming a guitar, reading *Treasure Island* or *Moby Dick* and coming home with a perfect tan and a year’s worth of Instagram posts—no filter, obviously. After all, yachts are a pastime of the wealthy and the Caribbean is a vacation destination. While there are innumerable moments of grandeur to be had at sea and all of the things I listed above usually happen multiple times on every voyage, they belie the full story. Any notion of #YachtLife is a delusion that gets shaken almost instantly.\n\nStudents step onto the ship and they step into a new world. First, the language is completely different—both the immense vocabulary of nautical terminology as well as the style of repeating commands. When you are given a task, you repeat the command back to the person who just gave it to you, then you go do the task, then once the task is done you return to the person who gave you the task and tell them it is complete, which they then repeat back to you. This creates a closed loop—there is little chance for miscommunication—but that much repetition does not come naturally. So not only do students have multiple subject areas to master—navigation, seamanship, meteorology, watch standing duties, laboratory procedures—but their way of communicating is being frequently corrected. They are studying new subjects in a new language in a place that is constantly moving (making many of them seasick) and with a watch-standing schedule that means their sleep is inconsistent. On all fronts, my semester with SEA in college was, hands down, my most challenging term and Brown University was not exactly a cake walk.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wYOcovwOe7n5jeVg9IkIg.jpeg?height=3456&width=4608)\n\n## A Three Phase Approach\n\nEvery voyage program I have sailed on—SEA vessels and Proctor Academy’s Ocean Classroom semester—breaks their trip into three phases: The Spaghetti Phase, The Shadow Phase, and the Junior Watch Officer (JWO) Phase. The Spaghetti Phase is so named because, for the students, it feels like information is being thrown at them like spaghetti: some of it sticks and some (most) just falls to the deck. It could also be called the Firehose Phase because it can feel like drinking from a firehose. Whatever the metaphor, the first phase is characterized by feeling overwhelmed, adjusting to the boat, and being corrected frequently. It can be discouraging, so building unity within a student’s watch is important as is creating frequent moments for light hearted community building. The goal is for students to learn *what* to do and to see this behavior role-modeled by the staff.\n\nThe second phase (usually following two weeks of spaghetti) is when students start to shift to learning *why* things are done. During each watch, a student is selected to be the shadow and follow the mate through their duties. The mate narrates what they are doing as they do it, the student accompanies the mate when they check in with the captain, and the student starts to take the lead in various routines, like making sure the hourly boat checks and weather observations are completed. This is the chance to start peeking behind the curtain and feel invited to partake in the boat’s management.\n\nFinally, the JWO Phase. In many ways, the entire trip builds to the JWO Phase. During this phase, a student is elevated to the position of Junior Watch Officer during their watch and takes over for the mate. Students interact directly with the captain to respond to weather changes, recommend sail evolutions, and delegate tasks within their watch.  The JWO can even delegate tasks to the mate, so long as the task does not take the mate away from the quarterdeck for more than 10 minutes. While the mate is still the safety officer and legally responsible for the watch, they step back as much as possible. Mates are told to let mistakes happen and only yell “Hold!” if a student is about to injure someone or damage the boat. No reason is given for yelling “Hold!”, so action does not resume until the JWO or one of their watchmates discovers the problem and corrects it.\n\n![A JWO, wearing the \"JWO Hat,\" plotting the ship's position.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pw2OQCJQxLevILLX_gG1F.jpeg?height=3024&width=4032)\n\n## A Recipe for Great Learning\n\nThis three phase progression is where the magic happens. All three phases are essential; neither is successful without the other two. Most conventional classrooms never make it past the Spaghetti Phase. Conversely, if we were to skip the Spaghetti Phase, the students would not feel prepared for the greater responsibility asked of them. This progression works because of the learning environment that is very intentionally created by the staff, both in the program’s core design and through staff meetings that happen underway. That environment consists of a few essential ingredients:\n\n1. **Authenticity**. If students feel that their input and time is valued as part of an experience that is not “busy work,” they will invest in it. Since the boat is a real boat sailing on the ocean, everything connected to that objective being completed successfully is very clearly not busy work. There are very real consequences to not doing a job completely or correctly. This element drives home the value of “Seek Excellence.”\n2. **Relevance**. A student could be assigned the authentic task of digging a big hole or meticulously cleaning the interior components of an antique pocket watch but will probably lose interest if the question “why” is not answered. This can sometimes happen with boat checks, which happen every hour on a boat and begin to take on an element of blind routine if their value is not reinforced. When it comes to establishing relevance, the connection can be specific to the student, broad to society, temporal to the moment at hand, or tied to the legacy of the human race 10,000 years from now, but there must be an answer.\n3. **Ownership**. Of all the characteristics here, this is the one we see the most frequently in existing classrooms. High school students are given charge of completing their assignments, showing up to class on time, and discharging a multitude of duties. What I advocate for here is that we create more pathways for the sphere of ownership to keep expanding. We should reward great performance with greater ownership.\n4. **Agency**. This is different from ownership, perhaps even a step up from ownership. Agency combines ownership, relevance, and authenticity to create a moments where the student makes choices that have consequences. As a mate, when I delegate setting a sail to a student, I have given them ownership of that task. Often, the ownership of something means following a script for how that job needs to be done: there is a right way to set a sail and a myriad of wrong ways. Agency means writing the script.\n5. **Ability to Fail**. It is possible to create a learning environment where all of the above are present and yet the lesson still falls short on this final element. A JWO will feel authenticity, relevance, ownership, and agency by the nature of being JWO, but if the mate steps in to answer a tough question or offers an overly revealing hint, the ability to fail dissolves. In some ways, ability to fail creates a deeper layer of fusion between authenticity and the relevance of the experience that generate moments of genuine discomfort for students.\n\n   As a mate, a critical element in creating a successful JWO Phase is to step back and let the student make mistakes, or forget things, or become overwhelmed. This can be hard because I want my students to succeed, but I have come to appreciate that there needs to be a “butterfly emerging from the chrysalis” moment if the value of everything that happened up to that point is going to matter. A student can watch and study something a million times, but then it is their turn to step up and do it. Near the end of the novel *The Alchemist*, the alchemist describes this concept to the protagonist:\n\n> “What you still need to know is this: before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we’ve learned as we’ve moved toward that dream. That’s the point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one ‘dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.’\n>\n> Every search begins with beginner’s luck. And every search ends with the victor’s being severely tested.”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XFo5fuOKYfz2DwkCXIQz_.jpg?height=447&width=450)\n\nTo be clear, I am not talking about fear of failing as a person. Our classrooms already have this trait to a damaging degree with our modern grading system and the pressure of college admissions. I have frequently seen tears on JWO and while sometimes that is just how a person processes stress, there needs to be a calibration of duties with what a student is ready for, which varies by person. When I debrief with my JWO after the watch is over, a pointer I frequently remind them of is to not be too hard on themself when they fail: accept that you will make a mistake, take a moment to reflect on it, and then give yourself the grace to move past it and you can unpack the lesson later. As a leader, you must move past it or you will be distracted from your job in that moment. I also believe that a student needs, ideally, a minimum of three shifts as JWO to enable them to witness their own progress and internalize lessons. Most often, a student’s first JWO stint is not pretty and having that be their one shot would be unfortunate.\n\n## Beyond Sailing\n\nSailing for weeks at a time is an amazing adventure that makes creating many of these conditions easier, but in some ways it is not ideal. The sleep schedule, seasickness, and risk of burnout for staff and students are the most obvious downsides. Sailing is also an expensive and exclusive opportunity. And do we really need a boat in order to do any of this?\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\n![Planet School terms will begin with 4-5 weeks sailing and then transfer to a land campus, bringing along the ethos developed underway.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yh6OSBRAKEr2wfgdma3uE.jpeg?height=3024&width=4032)\n\nMy goal with the Planet School is to take this process that I have seen be so effective on sailboats and replicate it in other realms. A three phase progression carried out between a knowledgeable practitioner and a group of students can be done in almost any field: the leader of a “watch” need not be a professional mariner. The expert could be a farmer, an engineer, an economist, or an artist. The task need not be sailing, it could be starting a business, managing a farm, or building a yurt. It could even be building a school.\n\nThe underlying project of the Planet School is to build the school itself. Since a campus is a community, such an undertaking could reasonably include a project in almost any discipline, giving students the chance to explore their passions and be exposed to potential passions they have not experienced before. Some of my most potent memories from high school are from the activities that included role-playing of “real life”: speech and debate, theatre, Model UN, Youth Legislature, and the school newspaper. Through the prevalence of internships, externships, and youth employment as well as the cliche of how teenagers yearn to leave home, the desire for real world experience at that age is evident. We should build our schools to be authentic laboratories for trying out real world solutions. If we are to be better stewards of our planet, then we need to do more than encourage experimentation, bold thinking, and sustainability—we need to create education spaces where we actively train youth in those habits.\n\nI never imagined myself as a teacher. I never imagined myself working in education. Yet I have learned that any systemic reimagining of human civilization must begin with how we equip our future generations. My vision for school is that, whatever the project, students are challenged in an authentic, relevant way where they have agency, feel ownership, and are trusted to be able to fail.", "timestamp": 1653239582, "digest": "SiaaK_sDxGc1-zoy7KhbTktMsmr-WZmS8dSheqQM8Yc", "contributor": "0x505683cF3aDdF5DE8E82AABB9d24763B9A72aAD0"}

NFT游戏角色简介\n\n### 2.1 雪人Yeti\n\nYeti是游戏最主要的角色，它们可用于开采特定资源，具体取决于Yeti的种族类型和稀有度。 \n\n一共有9种不同的雪人，根据产出的不同可以分为三组类型：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vAsGagFc0aXYodf-AgWKq.png?height=263&width=554)\n\n拿着普通斧头、高级斧头，手拿普通锯子的雪人开采木头资源，每次开采需消耗能量和工具耐久度，耐久度可通过矿石代币修复。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5YSw19O1fsamU1y-TtNol.png?height=271&width=554)\n\n带电锯、普通镐和电钻的雪人开采矿石资源(millirium)，每次开采需消耗能量和工具耐久度，耐久度通过木头代币修复。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3MYMR2ANfzZv_wLaqA5v2.png?height=265&width=554)\n\n初学、中级和高级的雪人工程师是可再生能源生产的先驱，它们产出能量，每次开采仅消耗耐久，耐久需要通过矿石和木头来修复。\n\n### 2.2 护身符Amulet\n\n游戏中目前有6种不同的护身符，可以用于增加每次开采的资源数量，或减少每次开采所需要消耗的数量，同时将护身符放置到祭坛还可以产出一些spirit代币。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9nw67oE3IxfpdMcVCDmQ-.png?height=282&width=312)\n\n护身符除了可从atomichub交易市场购买，还可以使用木头、矿石和精神三种代币来制作。\n\n### 2.3 魔法砖magicbrick\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-epA4k2iHzHWgbxPy2aR1.png?height=346&width=430)\n\n小屋(cabin)是雪人们居住的建筑物，游戏初始为每个玩家提供了两间小屋，初始每间小屋仅可容纳一个同一类型的雪人，也就是如果你有两个工程师雪人NFT用于挖能量代币，可将它们分别放置到两个小屋中，但如果有第三个同样用于挖掘能量的雪人，就需要使用魔法砖来升级你的小屋。 \n\n蓝色和绿色魔法砖可用于增加小屋容量，普通cabin升级到大型cabin需要3块蓝色魔法砖或1块绿色魔法砖，大型升级到别墅需要6块蓝色魔法砖或2块绿砖，一个玩家最多可在游戏内放置18只不同类型的雪人。 \n\n粉色和紫色魔法砖则可用于增加使用护身符的插槽。\n\n \n\n### 2.4 土地land\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/B9wzz_HQZRDqr-7hphMyv.png?height=320&width=554)\n\n玩家除了挖掘资源，也可以选择持有一块或多块土地，每块土地有不同的开采类型和稀有度，土地所有者可从其他玩家在该土地上开采的资源中获得 2% 到 8% 的分润收益。 \n\n注意目前土地还未开始销售，另外如上图所示，在页面中心的阿曼达岛屿附近有六块大型岛屿(megaland)，官方后期将会举行拍卖会，它们每一块是普通土地面积的7倍，且该土地的所有者将和传奇土地所有者平分系统总佣金池的40%。\n\n \n\n## 3. 玩法流程 \n\n在对经济模型和游戏角色有个基础了解后，让我们来看看雪人家族的具体玩法： \n\n**进入游戏网站自动连接钱包：**\n\n[https://saar.game/](https://saar.game/)\n\n**第一次登录首先会看到资源选择页面：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vdC2xqfZ1zS57DBucooNs.png?height=329&width=554)\n\n根据你持有的雪人类型选择其中一种资源类型来采挖，玩家在同一时间段只能开采木头、矿石、能源这三种中的其中一种，如果你选择开采能源，而账号中还有挖掘木头的雪人，那它将只能产出spirit代币(无需消耗能量)。 \n\n玩家可自由切换采挖资源类型，但需要支付相应的代币，比如从挖能源切换到挖木头，需支付500个srw币。 \n\n**选择土地：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yIYHEJHdvNmdviTTCuKUe.png?height=287&width=554)\n\n土地可以选megaland或是周围的普通土地都可以，只要点击每块土地看到左侧详细信息里显示有choose for mining即可选择，土地选择需注意，如果是普通地，land type要选择和你主挖的资源一致的地，另外天气尽量选当前是sunny的，如果是其他天气类型会影响产出。\n\n \n\n**选好后在页面右下角点击Village进入游戏页面如下图所示：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4cCnUWahZUSIGs44sUNhq.png?height=308&width=554)\n\n**点击小屋，进入采挖页面：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6K5wHYo_jd99wwTM7YL82.png?height=316&width=554)\n\n根据你的雪人类型在右侧分栏选择合适的插槽放置NFT，放置好后如无显示刷新页面即可。\n\n**雪人放置好后即可开始采挖：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fFmRVQoPILIRN_7MqqIqN.png?height=320&width=554)\n\n上图是普通能量开采工程师的采挖页面，每1小时claim一次，一次大约可获得45.45个能量代币，消耗60个耐久度，需要12个矿石和18个木头代币来修复，这里玩家可选择每次去repair，也可以积累到耐久度用完。 \n\n另如果是挖木头或矿石，采挖时需要消耗能量，因此要事先充入一些能量代币到游戏中。 \n\n以上就是雪人家族大致的流程，目前claim间隔默认是1小时，每支付5个spirit币可将claim间隔时间延长1小时。 \n\n**收益方面团队暂时没有给官方的ROI表，这里附上一份社区玩家做的表格：**\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iOYDIqOca5KLEZB3QS6Eqs5TblaK0oE9dB2VnXgCGzs/edit#gid=2079524431](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iOYDIqOca5KLEZB3QS6Eqs5TblaK0oE9dB2VnXgCGzs/edit#gid=2079524431)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XuB9ij_hikVtKoIYzx9pR.png?height=251&width=554)\n\n可以填入你想配置的NFT，参考下大致的ROI，但需要注意，游戏内数据是动态变化的，它这里记录的消耗产出和实际存在出入，同时没有考虑手续费和精神代币的产出，所以它只是暂时的参考，从目前观察来看，产出矿石和能量的ROI比木头要好，同时等级越高的收益越高，不考虑价格波动，史诗传奇的ROI平均在10天上下，相对普通的在30天以上。\n\n## 4. 项目测评及潜力分析\n\nSAAR雪人家族是比较典型的多币制挖矿游戏，这也是目前市场主流的一种经济模型，玩家可选择不同的玩法策略，token之间互为供需，可使游戏维持更长期的经济平衡。 \n\n相对于市场同类项目，SAAR的主要亮点一是通过第四种代币sws的消耗，来延长claim时间间隔，达到一定程度的自动化采挖，从同类项目来看，这种设计是有一定玩家需求的。 \n\n另一个是天气状况的设计，每块土地每24小时都可能会有不同的天气变化，Sunny太阳天不会对玩家有任何影响，Windy阴天，有30%概率产生，它会减少Yeti15%的产出量，有10%的几率遇到Snowstorm暴风雪天，在这种天气条件下，开采量减少50%，同时消耗量翻倍，对于普通NFT，这时玩家可能需要选择停工。 \n\n天气的变量增加了游戏的随机性，同时也有助于对游戏内各种资源供需进行动态调整，通过对近年来链游市场的观察，我们也发现，经济模式不只是写在白皮书和表格里的单一数据，随着游戏的发展，能进行有效的动态调节对项目的长期很重要。 \n\n问题方面目前来说可能最主要的还是市场偏小众，据Dappradar数据，日活用户数在500左右，这里主要原因可能在于随着加密市场进入熊市，链游市场一直萎靡不振，特别是近期wax价格大幅下跌，也导致很多玩家离场，另外该项目从销售到上线的时间间隔稍长，现在也会存在一点热度缺失，包括NFT市场交易量暂时不高，还需要看团队在未来是否能够通过一些营销或市场活动激发更多玩家的兴趣。 \n\n不过市场趋冷对玩家来说不一定是坏事，像现在市场上的入门包也就在10-30刀不等，风险可控，所以它还是比较适合一些喜欢玩这种采挖游戏的玩家去体验。 \n\n对于未来的关注点一是制作合成，从NFT市场来看，他家各类型的雪人体量并不是特别大，早期包八九成也都被打开，随着用户增长，有望刺激合成需求，合成消耗更多的代币，代币价值增长再推动更多的用户增长，这也是这种挖矿合成类主要的增长模式。 \n\n另一个就是土地，目前官方还未公布销售规则，对玩家来说，它可能也是该游戏接下来的一个机会点。\n\n## 相关链接\n\n`官推：`\n\n[https://twitter.com/SaaR_nft](https://twitter.com/SaaR_nft)\n\n`白皮书：`\n\n[https://whitepaper.saar.network/](https://whitepaper.saar.network/)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653239757, "digest": "MIbMrEPFslnl04gAUayyZ2CpW313s_6GVvk6md56GEI", "contributor": "0xeF96650E66688D5Fedb995432E28cdadDCcCBF71"}

With that in mind, we’ve decided to do things a little differently and base our launch on (possibly) the rarest commodity in this market: awareness. Welcome to our stealth launch.\n\n\n---\n\n*The ASX Genesis Event has arrived.

There's no vesting. 100% of the max supply will be unlocked and circulating on day one.\n* Once the soft cap is reached (250,000,000 ASX minted), a countdown of 10 days will start. When it hits zero, the Genesis Event will end, the initial liquidity pool on Uniswap will be created and the remaining ASX will be burned along with the liquidity provider (LP) token.\n* ASX ERC-20 smart contract address: **0x5313235002b9F11698D7B9187Be44f836FEbD6b5**.\n\n\n---\n\n## A unique token launch\n\nAs a community-focused project committed to the ethos and founding principles of the blockchain space, we are pleased to announce the official launch of **ASX**, the governance token of the ASX Protocol.\n\nIn the spirit of equal distribution, fairness, decentralization, and a community-first ideology, the launch event is taking place on our [custom-made platform](https://mint.asx.st/) and it's the first and only opportunity for anyone to get access to the ASX Protocol's native token, **ASX**, which will give holders the power to govern and curate essential infrastructure components of the network.\n\nOur mission is to give everyone in our community an opportunity to become a stakeholder in the ecosystem, and we want to extend that opportunity as fairly as possible. Launching ASX on our own platform, with a mechanism that is fair and transparent for all participants, drastically increases the chances of achieving this mission.\n\nApart from building our own token launch platform, we made sure everyone was on a level playing field. There's no seed or private sale, no liquidity mining, no emission (zero inflation), zero tokens to influencers or promoters, no airdrop, and zero Treasury, Company, Founders, Team, or Partners allocation.\n\n### 1 billion ASX tokens. 800 million to be minted, 200 million for liquidity. That's it.\n\n> *The protocol's revenue will exclusively serve ASX holders and all operations will be funded with ETH or stablecoins.*\n\nThe ASX Genesis Event is open to all interested and qualifying parties. It's a major milestone for the ASX Protocol ecosystem and speaks to the viability of our core technology and business model as we aim to become the ultimate permissionless omnichain liquidity hub for staked assets.\n\nAt ASX Labs, we believe in creating a global staking ecosystem of the people, by the people, for the people, that shall not perish under any threats. The crypto dream has never been about creating an instrument that can easily be put in a box, but about creating global assets that can govern and manage these new decentralized global networks.\n\n## Understanding the mechanics\n\nTo mint 1 ASX you need to contribute 0.000004 ETH. A total of 800,000,000 ASX will be available for minting. Due to the low fully diluted market cap of the project and to ensure as broad a distribution as possible and dramatically soften the potential for a massive gas war, we decided to operate in stealth mode until 50% of the tokens are minted.\n\nThere's a minimum of 1 ASX per mint and no maximum. Setting up a max cap per wallet without KYC is foolish and we're not big fans of KYC in DeFi. For us, privacy and freedom are paramount, and we respect and stand by yours. With that said, there's a cap of 100 ETH per mint on our Interface just to slow things down, if they get a bit crazy.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to hear about the ASX Protocol early, you'll have enough time to participate. Otherwise, you can get ASX tokens on Uniswap, after the Genesis Event is completed.\n\n## How to participate\n\nParticipating in the ASX Genesis Event is simple, quick, and intuitive, and getting prepared is even easier. Here’s what you’ll need:\n\n→ **An Ethereum-compatible web3 browser wallet**, such as MetaMask. You can generate a wallet address from these web3 wallets directly, or use your seeds to import an existing wallet address.\n\n→ **Sufficient ETH**, which you will need in order to contribute and pay for transactions gas fees.\n\nOnce you’ve got your checklist all set, here’s what the process will look like:\n\n1. To get started, head to our custom-made [Launch Platform](https://mint.asx.st/).\n2. You’ll be prompted with a welcome message. Click on \"**PARTICIPATION TERMS**\". Read everything and, if you agree, click on \"**I AGREE**\". Next, click on \"**CONTINUE**\".\n3. The next message will be a TL;DR of the ASX Genesis Event. Carefully read everything and click on \"**CONTINUE**\".\n4. You can now connect your wallet. We support almost any web3 injected wallet, but for a flawless experience, we recommend using MetaMask. Click on \"**CONNECT WALLET**\", either in the center or on the upper right-hand corner of the page.\n5. Once your wallet is connected, the ETH and ASX input fields will become available to you. You may either insert the amount of ASX you would like to receive or the amount of ETH you would like to contribute. Enter the desired amount and click on \"**MINT**\". Please make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet to pay for transaction fees.\n6. You will see a popup from your MetaMask wallet. Confirm the transaction and then wait for it to go through. Once it is validated on the Ethereum blockchain, your ASX balance, on the top of the page, will update and a \"CLAIM\" button will appear. You will be able to claim your ASX tokens once the event is completed.\n7. That's it! You successfully participated in the ASX Genesis Event.\n\n*Once your transaction is validated, a smart contract, that works like an escrow, will receive your ASX tokens and keep them safe until the end of the Genesis Event, when you will be able to claim them. Claimed ASX tokens are not locked and there is no vesting.*\n\n*Team and partners are allowed to participate in the Genesis Event after the progress bar reaches 50%. If the desired amount of ASX that those parties intend to hold can't be fully minted during this event, the remaining amount will be purchased on Uniswap.*\n\n## Liquidity\n\nBy the end of the Genesis Event, the initial liquidity of the ASX token will be immediately provided as a full range position on Uniswap V3. Since the resulting liquidity provider (LP) token will be directly burned, this initial position will be perpetual.\n\nThe liquidity depth will represent 40% of the FDV (Fully Diluted Value) and its absolute value will be based on the total ASX minted.\n\n* At soft cap, 250 ETH will be paired with 62,500,000 ASX, pricing the token at $0.0077 / ASX with $962,500 of liquidity depth.\n* At hard cap, 800 ETH will be paired with 200,000,000 ASX, pricing the token at $0.0077 / ASX with $3,080,000 of liquidity depth.\n\n*The Genesis Event will end in 10 days after the soft cap is reached or when all ASX tokens are minted, whichever comes first. Any unminted ASX will be burned.*\n\n## Security\n\nWe were very careful when deciding the code for the ASX ERC-20 smart contract and, to make it the safest possible, we only allowed the absolutely necessary lines of code. There's no mint function, no pause function and the contract is not upgradeable. It is an immutable token on the Ethereum Mainnet Network.\n\nBoth the ERC-20 and the Genesis Event smart contracts were developed with the highest levels of security, leveraging the battle-tested OpenZeppelin standard. With the entire supply circulating by the end of the Genesis Event plus the immediate burn of the liquidity provider (LP) token, you can rest assured that the ASX token can never be hacked or rugged.\n\n### Important Notes\n\nThe team at ASX Labs will NEVER DM YOU FIRST or ask you for money on any platform. You should be very skeptical of any DMs received by anyone claiming to be from ASX Labs.\n\nOnly trust ASX Protocol's official channels at the bottom of this announcement for information surrounding the event.\n\nThe ASX token will only be available once the Genesis Event is completed. Only then you will be able to trade it on Uniswap. Be sure to always check the smart contract address before trading.\n\n\n---\n\nThis is the first step towards an omnichain yield future.

With that in mind, we’ve decided to do things a little differently and base our launch on (possibly) the rarest commodity in this market: awareness. Welcome to our stealth launch.\n\n\n---\n\n*The ASX Genesis Event has arrived. Please read this article carefully to understand the novel mechanics of this event.*\n\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\n*Values in US$ consider ETH priced at $1,925.*\n\n* **Token:** ASX (ERC-20) → Governance Token of the ASX Protocol\n* **Network:** Ethereum Mainnet\n* **Total / Max Supply:** 1,000,000,000 ASX\n* **Genesis Event Allocation:** 800,000,000 ASX\n* **Initial Liquidity Allocation:** 200,000,000 ASX\n* **Mint Rate:** 1 ASX / 0.000004 ETH or 250,000 ASX / 1 ETH\n* **Venue:** Self-hosted at <https://mint.asx.st/>\n* **Mode:** First-come, first-served basis (FCFS)\n* **Start date**: Live now\n* **End date**: 10 days after the soft cap is reached\n* **Soft Cap:** 1000 ETH | 250,000,000 ASX minted\n* **Hard Cap:** 3200 ETH | 800,000,000 ASX minted\n* **Fully Diluted Market Cap / Value (FDV)**\n  * **at Soft Cap:** 312,500,000 ASX \\~ $2,406,250 | 687,500,000 ASX burned\n  * **at Hard Cap:** 1,000,000,000 ASX \\~ $7,700,000 | 0 ASX burned\n* **Initial Liquidity (40% of FDV)**\n  * **at Soft Cap:** 62,500,000 ASX + 250 ETH | \\~ $962,500\n  * **at Hard Cap:** 200,000,000 ASX + 800 ETH | \\~ $3,080,000\n* There's no founders or team allocation, no seed or private sale, no liquidity mining, and no airdrop. The Genesis Event is the first and only place to get ASX tokens before listing.\n* Team and partners are allowed to participate after the progress bar reaches 50%.\n* Participants can claim their ASX tokens once the event is completed. There's no vesting. 100% of the max supply will be unlocked and circulating on day one.\n* Once the soft cap is reached (250,000,000 ASX minted), a countdown of 10 days will start. When it hits zero, the Genesis Event will end, the initial liquidity pool on Uniswap will be created and the remaining ASX will be burned along with the liquidity provider (LP) token.\n* ASX ERC-20 smart contract address: **0x5313235002b9F11698D7B9187Be44f836FEbD6b5**.\n\n\n---\n\n## A unique token launch\n\nAs a community-focused project committed to the ethos and founding principles of the blockchain space, we are pleased to announce the official launch of **ASX**, the governance token of the ASX Protocol.\n\nIn the spirit of equal distribution, fairness, decentralization, and a community-first ideology, the launch event is taking place on our [custom-made platform](https://mint.asx.st/) and it's the first and only opportunity for anyone to get access to the ASX Protocol's native token, **ASX**, which will give holders the power to govern and curate essential infrastructure components of the network.\n\nOur mission is to give everyone in our community an opportunity to become a stakeholder in the ecosystem, and we want to extend that opportunity as fairly as possible. Launching ASX on our own platform, with a mechanism that is fair and transparent for all participants, drastically increases the chances of achieving this mission.\n\nApart from building our own token launch platform, we made sure everyone was on a level playing field. There's no seed or private sale, no liquidity mining, no emission (zero inflation), zero tokens to influencers or promoters, no airdrop, and zero Treasury, Company, Founders, Team, or Partners allocation.\n\n### 1 billion ASX tokens. 800 million to be minted, 200 million for liquidity. That's it.\n\n> ***The protocol's revenue will exclusively serve ASX holders and all operations will be funded with ETH or stablecoins.***\n\nThe ASX Genesis Event is open to all interested and qualifying parties. It's a major milestone for the ASX Protocol ecosystem and speaks to the viability of our core technology and business model as we aim to become the ultimate permissionless omnichain liquidity hub for staked assets.\n\nAt ASX Labs, we believe in creating a global staking ecosystem of the people, by the people, for the people, that shall not perish under any threats. The crypto dream has never been about creating an instrument that can easily be put in a box, but about creating global assets that can govern and manage these new decentralized global networks.\n\n## Understanding the mechanics\n\nTo mint 1 ASX you need to contribute 0.000004 ETH. A total of 800,000,000 ASX will be available for minting. Due to the low fully diluted market cap of the project and to ensure as broad a distribution as possible and dramatically soften the potential for a massive gas war, we decided to operate in stealth mode until 50% of the tokens are minted.\n\nThere's a minimum of 1 ASX per mint and no maximum.

I had never been sailing before and I had no idea how profoundly that voyage would impact me. They say that the sea is a great teacher and I agree, but the community we intentionally create at sea deserves description too.\n\nAn isolated ship at sea is, in many ways, an ideal medium for creating deeply impactful learning opportunities. For this inaugural Planet School blog post, I want to share why I love to teach at sea and how the core elements of an ocean-based curriculum do not actually need to be unique to the sea at all. To do that, I need to give a bit of background on what it means to go sailing for a semester on a tall ship.\n\n![Removing the crutch of GPS and navigating with the stars is yet another opportunity for authentic student agency.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2czv-EUWimA9Q8y4l-iNF.jpeg?height=450&width=600)\n\nMake no mistake: sailing is hard work. I suspect that many students, like me when I was 20 years old, perceive a semester aboard a sailboat as one of relaxing exoticism bordering on luxuriousness: perfect sunsets, dolphins chasing the bow, strumming a guitar, reading *Treasure Island* or *Moby Dick* and coming home with a perfect tan and a year’s worth of Instagram posts—no filter, obviously. After all, yachts are a pastime of the wealthy and the Caribbean is a vacation destination. While there are innumerable moments of grandeur to be had at sea and all of the things I listed above usually happen multiple times on every voyage, they belie the full story. Any notion of #YachtLife is a delusion that gets shaken almost instantly.\n\nStudents step onto the ship and they step into a new world. First, the language is completely different—both the immense vocabulary of nautical terminology as well as the style of repeating commands. When you are given a task, you repeat the command back to the person who just gave it to you, then you go do the task, then once the task is done you return to the person who gave you the task and tell them it is complete, which they then repeat back to you. This creates a closed loop—there is little chance for miscommunication—but that much repetition does not come naturally. So not only do students have multiple subject areas to master—navigation, seamanship, meteorology, watch standing duties, laboratory procedures—but their way of communicating is being frequently corrected. They are studying new subjects in a new language in a place that is constantly moving (making many of them seasick) and with a watch-standing schedule that means their sleep is inconsistent. On all fronts, my semester with SEA in college was, hands down, my most challenging term and Brown University was not exactly a cake walk.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wYOcovwOe7n5jeVg9IkIg.jpeg?height=3456&width=4608)\n\n## A Three Phase Approach\n\nEvery voyage program I have sailed on—SEA vessels and Proctor Academy’s Ocean Classroom semester—breaks their trip into three phases: The Spaghetti Phase, The Shadow Phase, and the Junior Watch Officer (JWO) Phase. The Spaghetti Phase is so named because, for the students, it feels like information is being thrown at them like spaghetti: some of it sticks and some (most) just falls to the deck. It could also be called the Firehose Phase because it can feel like drinking from a firehose. Whatever the metaphor, the first phase is characterized by feeling overwhelmed, adjusting to the boat, and being corrected frequently. It can be discouraging, so building unity within a student’s watch is important as is creating frequent moments for light hearted community building. The goal is for students to learn *what* to do and to see this behavior role-modeled by the staff.\n\nThe second phase (usually following two weeks of spaghetti) is when students start to shift to learning *why* things are done. During each watch, a student is selected to be the shadow and follow the mate through their duties. The mate narrates what they are doing as they do it, the student accompanies the mate when they check in with the captain, and the student starts to take the lead in various routines, like making sure the hourly boat checks and weather observations are completed. This is the chance to start peeking behind the curtain and feel invited to partake in the boat’s management.\n\nFinally, the JWO Phase. In many ways, the entire trip builds to the JWO Phase. During this phase, a student is elevated to the position of Junior Watch Officer during their watch and takes over for the mate. Students interact directly with the captain to respond to weather changes, recommend sail evolutions, and delegate tasks within their watch.  The JWO can even delegate tasks to the mate, so long as the task does not take the mate away from the quarterdeck for more than 10 minutes. While the mate is still the safety officer and legally responsible for the watch, they step back as much as possible. Mates are told to let mistakes happen and only yell “Hold!” if a student is about to injure someone or damage the boat. No reason is given for yelling “Hold!”, so action does not resume until the JWO or one of their watchmates discovers the problem and corrects it.\n\n![A JWO, wearing the \"JWO Hat,\" plotting the ship's position.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pw2OQCJQxLevILLX_gG1F.jpeg?height=3024&width=4032)\n\n## A Recipe for Great Learning\n\nThis three phase progression is where the magic happens. All three phases are essential; neither is successful without the other two. Most conventional classrooms never make it past the Spaghetti Phase. Conversely, if we were to skip the Spaghetti Phase, the students would not feel prepared for the greater responsibility asked of them. This progression works because of the learning environment that is very intentionally created by the staff, both in the program’s core design and through staff meetings that happen underway. That environment consists of a few essential ingredients:\n\n1. **Authenticity**. If students feel that their input and time is valued as part of an experience that is not “busy work,” they will invest in it. Since the boat is a real boat sailing on the ocean, everything connected to that objective being completed successfully is very clearly not busy work. There are very real consequences to not doing a job completely or correctly. This element drives home the value of “Seek Excellence.”\n2. **Relevance**. A student could be assigned the authentic task of digging a big hole or meticulously cleaning the interior components of an antique pocket watch but will probably lose interest if the question “why” is not answered. This can sometimes happen with boat checks, which happen every hour on a boat and begin to take on an element of blind routine if their value is not reinforced. When it comes to establishing relevance, the connection can be specific to the student, broad to society, temporal to the moment at hand, or tied to the legacy of the human race 10,000 years from now, but there must be an answer.\n3. **Ownership**. Of all the characteristics here, this is the one we see the most frequently in existing classrooms. High school students are given charge of completing their assignments, showing up to class on time, and discharging a multitude of duties. What I advocate for here is that we create more pathways for the sphere of ownership to keep expanding. We should reward great performance with greater ownership.\n4. **Agency**. This is different from ownership, perhaps even a step up from ownership. Agency combines ownership, relevance, and authenticity to create a moments where the student makes choices that have consequences. As a mate, when I delegate setting a sail to a student, I have given them ownership of that task. Often, the ownership of something means following a script for how that job needs to be done: there is a right way to set a sail and a myriad of wrong ways. Agency means writing the script.\n5. **Ability to Fail**. It is possible to create a learning environment where all of the above are present and yet the lesson still falls short on this final element. A JWO will feel authenticity, relevance, ownership, and agency by the nature of being JWO, but if the mate steps in to answer a tough question or offers an overly revealing hint, the ability to fail dissolves. In some ways, ability to fail creates a deeper layer of fusion between authenticity and the relevance of the experience that generate moments of genuine discomfort for students.\n\n   As a mate, a critical element in creating a successful JWO Phase is to step back and let the student make mistakes, or forget things, or become overwhelmed. This can be hard because I want my students to succeed, but I have come to appreciate that there needs to be a “butterfly emerging from the chrysalis” moment if the value of everything that happened up to that point is going to matter. A student can watch and study something a million times, but then it is their turn to step up and do it. Near the end of the novel *The Alchemist*, the alchemist describes this concept to the protagonist:\n\n> “What you still need to know is this: before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we’ve learned as we’ve moved toward that dream. That’s the point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one ‘dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.’\n>\n> Every search begins with beginner’s luck. And every search ends with the victor’s being severely tested.”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XFo5fuOKYfz2DwkCXIQz_.jpg?height=447&width=450)\n\nTo be clear, I am not talking about fear of failing as a person. Our classrooms already have this trait to a damaging degree with our modern grading system and the pressure of college admissions. I have frequently seen tears on JWO and while sometimes that is just how a person processes stress, there needs to be a calibration of duties with what a student is ready for, which varies by person. When I debrief with my JWO after the watch is over, a pointer I frequently remind them of is to not be too hard on themself when they fail: accept that you will make a mistake, take a moment to reflect on it, and then give yourself the grace to move past it and you can unpack the lesson later. As a leader, you must move past it or you will be distracted from your job in that moment. I also believe that a student needs, ideally, a minimum of three shifts as JWO to enable them to witness their own progress and internalize lessons. Most often, a student’s first JWO stint is not pretty and having that be their one shot would be unfortunate.\n\n## Beyond Sailing\n\nSailing for weeks at a time is an amazing adventure that makes creating many of these conditions easier, but in some ways it is not ideal. The sleep schedule, seasickness, and risk of burnout for staff and students are the most obvious downsides. Sailing is also an expensive and exclusive opportunity. And do we really need a boat in order to do any of this?\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\n![Planet School terms will begin with 4-5 weeks sailing and then transfer to a land campus, bringing along the ethos developed underway.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yh6OSBRAKEr2wfgdma3uE.jpeg?height=3024&width=4032)\n\nMy goal with the Planet School is to take this process that I have seen be so effective on sailboats and replicate it in other realms. A three phase progression carried out between a knowledgeable practitioner and a group of students can be done in almost any field: the leader of a “watch” need not be a professional mariner. The expert could be a farmer, an engineer, an economist, or an artist. The task need not be sailing, it could be starting a business, managing a farm, or building a yurt. It could even be building a school.\n\nThe underlying project of the Planet School is to build the school itself. Since a campus is a community, such an undertaking could reasonably include a project in almost any discipline, giving students the chance to explore their passions and be exposed to potential passions they have not experienced before. Some of my most potent memories from high school are from the activities that included role-playing of “real life”: speech and debate, theatre, Model UN, Youth Legislature, and the school newspaper. Through the prevalence of internships, externships, and youth employment as well as the cliche of how teenagers yearn to leave home, the desire for real world experience at that age is evident. We should build our schools to be authentic laboratories for trying out real world solutions. If we are to be better stewards of our planet, then we need to do more than encourage experimentation, bold thinking, and sustainability—we need to create education spaces where we actively train youth in those habits.\n\nI never imagined myself as a teacher. I never imagined myself working in education. Yet I have learned that any systemic reimagining of human civilization must begin with how we equip our future generations. My vision for school is that, whatever the project, students are challenged in an authentic, relevant way where they have agency, feel ownership, and are trusted to be able to fail.", "timestamp": 1653240036, "digest": "SiaaK_sDxGc1-zoy7KhbTktMsmr-WZmS8dSheqQM8Yc", "contributor": "0x505683cF3aDdF5DE8E82AABB9d24763B9A72aAD0"}

{"id": "l5UF_vuCanTR12l4OciB1z_OMSvMAAg9N3f18-Up1N4", "title": "ASX Genesis Event", "body": "## Not you usual TGE\n\nThere have been many debates about what the fairest token generation event mechanism would be, but a consensus has yet to be reached. With that in mind, we’ve decided to do things a little differently and base our launch on (possibly) the rarest commodity in this market: awareness. Welcome to our stealth launch.\n\n\n---\n\n*The ASX Genesis Event has arrived. Please read this article carefully to understand the novel mechanics of this event.*\n\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\n*Values in US$ consider ETH priced at $1,925.*\n\n* **Token:** ASX (ERC-20) → Governance Token of the ASX Protocol\n* **Network:** Ethereum Mainnet\n* **Total / Max Supply:** 1,000,000,000 ASX\n* **Genesis Event Allocation:** 800,000,000 ASX\n* **Initial Liquidity Allocation:** 200,000,000 ASX\n* **Mint Rate:** 1 ASX / 0.000004 ETH or 250,000 ASX / 1 ETH\n* **Venue:** Self-hosted at <https://mint.asx.st/>\n* **Mode:** First-come, first-served basis (FCFS)\n* **Start date**: Live now\n* **End date**: 10 days after the soft cap is reached\n* **Soft Cap:** 1000 ETH | 250,000,000 ASX minted\n* **Hard Cap:** 3200 ETH | 800,000,000 ASX minted\n* **Fully Diluted Market Cap / Value (FDV)**\n  * **at Soft Cap:** 312,500,000 ASX \\~ $2,406,250 | 687,500,000 ASX burned\n  * **at Hard Cap:** 1,000,000,000 ASX \\~ $7,700,000 | 0 ASX burned\n* **Initial Liquidity (40% of FDV)**\n  * **at Soft Cap:** 62,500,000 ASX + 250 ETH | \\~ $962,500\n  * **at Hard Cap:** 200,000,000 ASX + 800 ETH | \\~ $3,080,000\n* There's no founders or team allocation, no seed or private sale, no liquidity mining, and no airdrop. The Genesis Event is the first and only place to get ASX tokens before listing.\n* Team and partners are allowed to participate after the progress bar reaches 50%.\n* Participants can claim their ASX tokens once the event is completed. There's no vesting. 100% of the max supply will be unlocked and circulating on day one.\n* Once the soft cap is reached (250,000,000 ASX minted), a countdown of 10 days will start. When it hits zero, the Genesis Event will end, the initial liquidity pool on Uniswap will be created and the remaining ASX will be burned along with the liquidity provider (LP) token.\n* ASX ERC-20 smart contract address: **0x5313235002b9F11698D7B9187Be44f836FEbD6b5**.\n\n\n---\n\n## A unique token launch\n\nAs a community-focused project committed to the ethos and founding principles of the blockchain space, we are pleased to announce the official launch of **ASX**, the governance token of the ASX Protocol.\n\nIn the spirit of equal distribution, fairness, decentralization, and a community-first ideology, the launch event is taking place on our [custom-made platform](https://mint.asx.st/) and it's the first and only opportunity for anyone to get access to the ASX Protocol's native token, **ASX**, which will give holders the power to govern and curate essential infrastructure components of the network.\n\nOur mission is to give everyone in our community an opportunity to become a stakeholder in the ecosystem, and we want to extend that opportunity as fairly as possible. Launching ASX on our own platform, with a mechanism that is fair and transparent for all participants, drastically increases the chances of achieving this mission.\n\nApart from building our own token launch platform, we made sure everyone was on a level playing field. There's no seed or private sale, no liquidity mining, no emission (zero inflation), zero tokens to influencers or promoters, no airdrop, and zero Treasury, Company, Founders, Team, or Partners allocation.\n\n### 1 billion ASX tokens. 800 million to be minted, 200 million for liquidity. That's it.\n\n> *The protocol's revenue will exclusively serve ASX holders and all operations will be funded with ETH or stablecoins.*\n\nThe ASX Genesis Event is open to all interested and qualifying parties. It's a major milestone for the ASX Protocol ecosystem and speaks to the viability of our core technology and business model as we aim to become the ultimate permissionless omnichain liquidity hub for staked assets.\n\nAt ASX Labs, we believe in creating a global staking ecosystem of the people, by the people, for the people, that shall not perish under any threats. The crypto dream has never been about creating an instrument that can easily be put in a box, but about creating global assets that can govern and manage these new decentralized global networks.\n\n## Understanding the mechanics\n\nTo mint 1 ASX you need to contribute 0.000004 ETH. A total of 800,000,000 ASX will be available for minting. Due to the low fully diluted market cap of the project and to ensure as broad a distribution as possible and dramatically soften the potential for a massive gas war, we decided to operate in stealth mode until 50% of the tokens are minted.\n\nThere's a minimum of 1 ASX per mint and no maximum. Setting up a max cap per wallet without KYC is foolish and we're not big fans of KYC in DeFi. For us, privacy and freedom are paramount, and we respect and stand by yours. With that said, there's a cap of 100 ETH per mint on our Interface just to slow things down, if they get a bit crazy.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to hear about the ASX Protocol early, you'll have enough time to participate. Otherwise, you can get ASX tokens on Uniswap, after the Genesis Event is completed.\n\n## How to participate\n\nParticipating in the ASX Genesis Event is simple, quick, and intuitive, and getting prepared is even easier. Here’s what you’ll need:\n\n→ **An Ethereum-compatible web3 browser wallet**, such as MetaMask. You can generate a wallet address from these web3 wallets directly, or use your seeds to import an existing wallet address.\n\n→ **Sufficient ETH**, which you will need in order to contribute and pay for transactions gas fees.\n\nOnce you’ve got your checklist all set, here’s what the process will look like:\n\n1. To get started, head to our custom-made [Launch Platform](https://mint.asx.st/).\n2. You’ll be prompted with a welcome message. Click on \"**PARTICIPATION TERMS**\". Read everything and, if you agree, click on \"**I AGREE**\". Next, click on \"**CONTINUE**\".\n3. The next message will be a TL;DR of the ASX Genesis Event. Carefully read everything and click on \"**CONTINUE**\".\n4. You can now connect your wallet. We support almost any web3 injected wallet, but for a flawless experience, we recommend using MetaMask. Click on \"**CONNECT WALLET**\", either in the center or on the upper right-hand corner of the page.\n5. Once your wallet is connected, the ETH and ASX input fields will become available to you. You may either insert the amount of ASX you would like to receive or the amount of ETH you would like to contribute. Enter the desired amount and click on \"**MINT**\". Please make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet to pay for transaction fees.\n6. You will see a popup from your MetaMask wallet. Confirm the transaction and then wait for it to go through. Once it is validated on the Ethereum blockchain, your ASX balance, on the top of the page, will update and a \"CLAIM\" button will appear. You will be able to claim your ASX tokens once the event is completed.\n7. That's it! You successfully participated in the ASX Genesis Event.\n\n*Once your transaction is validated, a smart contract, that works like an escrow, will receive your ASX tokens and keep them safe until the end of the Genesis Event, when you will be able to claim them. Claimed ASX tokens are not locked and there is no vesting.*\n\n*Team and partners are allowed to participate in the Genesis Event after the progress bar reaches 50%. If the desired amount of ASX that those parties intend to hold can't be fully minted during this event, the remaining amount will be purchased on Uniswap.*\n\n## Liquidity\n\nBy the end of the Genesis Event, the initial liquidity of the ASX token will be immediately provided as a full range position on Uniswap V3. Since the resulting liquidity provider (LP) token will be directly burned, this initial position will be perpetual.\n\nThe liquidity depth will represent 40% of the FDV (Fully Diluted Value) and its absolute value will be based on the total ASX minted.\n\n* At soft cap, 250 ETH will be paired with 62,500,000 ASX, pricing the token at $0.0077 / ASX with $962,500 of liquidity depth.\n* At hard cap, 800 ETH will be paired with 200,000,000 ASX, pricing the token at $0.0077 / ASX with $3,080,000 of liquidity depth.\n\n*The Genesis Event will end in 10 days after the soft cap is reached or when all ASX tokens are minted, whichever comes first. Any unminted ASX will be burned.*\n\n## Security\n\nWe were very careful when deciding the code for the ASX ERC-20 smart contract and, to make it the safest possible, we only allowed the absolutely necessary lines of code. There's no mint function, no pause function and the contract is not upgradeable. It is an immutable token on the Ethereum Mainnet Network.\n\nBoth the ERC-20 and the Genesis Event smart contracts were developed with the highest levels of security, leveraging the battle-tested OpenZeppelin standard. With the entire supply circulating by the end of the Genesis Event plus the immediate burn of the liquidity provider (LP) token, you can rest assured that the ASX token can never be hacked or rugged.\n\n### Important Notes\n\nThe team at ASX Labs will NEVER DM YOU FIRST or ask you for money on any platform. You should be very skeptical of any DMs received by anyone claiming to be from ASX Labs.\n\nOnly trust ASX Protocol's official channels at the bottom of this announcement for information surrounding the event.\n\nThe ASX token will only be available once the Genesis Event is completed. Only then you will be able to trade it on Uniswap. Be sure to always check the smart contract address before trading.\n\n\n---\n\nThis is the first step towards an omnichain yield future.

(the full text is 3588 words and takes about 5 − 10 minutes to read.)\n\nWe mean that as long as we have chased and loved each other, we can have an “Internet anniversary” every day, every year, for this young people to have fun and celebrate. If we are not even, we can also find online confidants. (I really hope that KK’s birthday can also catch this carnival on May 11 next year.)\n\n0406, 0505, seventh and ninth anniversaries… Looking back on these anniversaries this year, it is really more and more lively, and the more lively it is, the more prominent the coldness of the Internet. Youdao is in response to that sentence - busy anniversary, barren Internet.\n\nSo, do the beautiful days that I’ve heard of really exist?\n\n“The reason why we are here today is to celebrate the birthday of our best friend, Gu Li…”\n\nThe standard script for Ms. Gu Li’s birthday, oh, the same day is also her father’s memorial day, or the “rotten and smelly day” of the time sisters. From birthday greetings, birthday entries, birthday posters to outdoor screens, the little rich woman of the times is no less than an artist.\n\nMr. Liu mintao’s “red high heels” is the first direct shot actress in the history of internal entertainment. One must be arranged to commemorate the direct shot.\n\nIn the twinkling of an eye, sister Xun’s “a lot of people” expression bag has been for several years. By the way, it is Lu Fei and crayon Xiaoxin’s birthday on the same day. I wish the two Taurus children a happy birthday.\n\nAs for the grand carnival of “Internet anniversary”, at least not the draft.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2021, we watched the domestic entertainment talent show from the first year to hot and then to quietly end.\n\nThe first year, the day when the limited group ninepercent became a group, announced the arrival of a new era, and many people’s dreams began from this day;\n\nIn the second year, unine, a limited group, successfully promoted the era of draft automation because of its random ranking distribution;\n\nIn the third year, there was no debut night and no group. The building of internal entertainment draft was stopped when it was built to the second floor, which indirectly became a “uncompleted residential building”. Since then, it has become Xiufen’s “Qingming Festival”.\n\n“Youth 3” ixform made its debut quietly in an unnamed music. The debut night of the finals that failed to be broadcast was quietly buried together with the draft, which is sad.\n\nThe internal entertainment talent show has changed for only three or four years. Seeing him rise from a tall building, see his banquet guests, and see his building collapse, now, Xiufen people recall their youth by relying on the pictures of memories and on a special anniversary day.\n\nDo you want this blessing?\n\nA “Legend of Zhen Huan” can be said to have kept LETV I prosperous.\n\nMany years later, there are still a large number of audiences “passing the love pass”. The founder of Hua’er film and television, the producer of the legend of Zhen Huan, said: “the legend of Zhen Huan can bring more than 10 million profits to Hua’er film and television (which has been acquired by LETV) every year.”\n\nWell, why not?\n\nWhether it’s the birthday of ANN bird, the memorial day of Zhen Huan’s return to the palace, or the 300 year anniversary of the legend of Zhen Huan, it’s the audience’s real love for the play,\n\nThe audience is willing to look at a carefully carved work with a magnifying glass and see it again and again, which also shows that the audience has enough patience and appreciation ability for the work with real intention.\n\nFrom the examination questions of level 10 of the legend of Zhen Huan to how many episodes you can live in the palace, a variety of extended topics and challenges are still active on the platform today. This play seems to have become the spice of public life. Every day in the real-time square, people will plead with the creators of the legend of Zhen Huan to abide by the law and discipline, so as not to get the work off the shelves and become a public enemy of the whole people.\n\nSource: microblog screenshot\n\nThis year marks the ninth anniversary of the launch of the legend of Lu Zhen. Looking back on the whole story, Lu Zhen, an outstanding female representative of the Northern Qi Dynasty who was brave and firm and earned the position of Prime Minister for herself under the rule of the imperial power by relying on her own wisdom, is still a unique presence in the current TV series market.\n\nIn the past nine years, the actor himself has been in hot demand since his unknown place of origin. After a rough and hard journey, he finally got to Xintiandi and became the “85 flower” in the front line. I don’t know how ah Zhen, who is parallel to time and space, has also experienced unknown hardships. Is he happy with ah Zhan?\n\nOn the anniversary of another variety show “informal talks”, which has been with you for seven years, Chen Mingfa said that seven years is not a short life journey. His eldest daughter is seven years old. He saw some friends offline and told him that they were accompanying them from junior high school / high school to University / graduate school. He felt very honored to accompany you through your youth. These seven years of unhealthy time are also his youth and his UFO.\n\nThis UFO is straight ahead in any direction. It can take him to any place he wants to go, see the scenery, talk about any topic, and never die. He has been looking forward to seeing you again.\n\n“I can’t live without you.”\n\nLove me, scold me, whatever you want\n\n“Of course, I will be very moved. It shows that my acting skills have been recognized. We believe that there are such people around us. We believe that he (the role) has really come to the world. As an actor, there is nothing happier than this.” This is the true feeling of an actor who once worked with KK.\n\nThe time spent with the character is three months, six months or even longer to enter another person’s life and become this person. Experience his life and experience his joys and sorrows. “Sometimes it’s difficult to say goodbye. The hardest thing is to convince yourself that he doesn’t exist. If someone can remember him except me, at least he’s not so lonely.”\n\nThe audience can remember their own plays and characters, and even celebrate their birthdays and anniversaries outside the play. Remembering his life is a great affirmation for the actors.\n\nAt the most beautiful night BiliBili party in 2021, Zhang Wanyi, the actor of Chen Yannian in the awakening age, played a song “misplaced time and space”.\n\nPicture by network picture by network\n\nWhen the sound of leather shoes and chain rings at the same time, roles and players meet across time and space, maybe I", "timestamp": 1653240614, "digest": "RFaxcNKON4OJ8eGGLNGtFmiAL-IzfYeP6LeOFCsUZM4", "contributor": "0x1a79643D49D2C41D0E17B3Ad0DB838a27F85679a"}
{"id": "ID2VDvxQLTLDX4NJONhVShcga_zvVZ9CWUSq4YmAwjI", "title": "Heroines", "body": "So, we are very excited to announce \"The Heroines\" finally.\n\nBack in October, when we first started working on Heroes of the Metaverse,  one of the first decisions we had to make was how we would deal with the percentages of characters that would be males vs. females.\n\n***Who decides what?***\nHistorically, both in the NFT space and in the RPG/D&D world, women have been infra represented, and we did not want to reproduce the same stereotypes.\n\nThe logical decision was to divide the % of male characters vs. female characters by 50/50, closing the issue. Anything else would have been either negative or positive discrimination.\n\nAnd, of course, we didn’t want to dillute the series unnecessarily.\n\n## The five male founders dilemma\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the five founders are male heroes made us feel highly uncomfortable with the fact of creating Female Characters. Cesar Drawss -our Creative Director and artist- was the first one to raise the voice that he should not be the one designing female characters.\n\nBut in that early stage, the only members of Heroes of the Metaverse were the five founders.\n\nSo, all of these facts made us realize we were not comfortable or ready to launch the Heroines simultaneously as the Heroes.\n\n## Doodles: the inspiration\n\nAs everyone in this space wants to make something lasting and beautiful, we like to learn from everyone. And if there's someone we love about the NFT space is the creativity, the rule-breaking attitude, and the possibility of using technology to disrupt the status quo of what is possible and what's not.\n\n![Space Doodles is a subtle and brilliant innovation](https://doodles.app/images/doodle_plane.gif)\n\nAnd when Doodles announced the Space Doodles, what caught our attention was the technology they used. For us, the wrapped NFTs technology is one of the greatest innovations in the NFT space since the Azuki's ERC721A smart contract.\n\nEven if only a tiny percentage of people realize what this could become in the future, we also see this could be a great way to transform your Male Hero into a Female Hero. And, with it, let the market choose the % of female heroes vs. male heroes.\n\n## The Heroines\n\nAfter learning how the wrapped NFTs work, we decided not to use this technology.\n\nSince the change of sex is a variable and an image, we didn't need it as it does not bring any other value to the user. If we had wanted to use the wrapped NFTs, we would have required a second contract and a utility tool to enable the wrapping for the user. That would represent an unnecessary cost for the holder since the gas fee would have been much higher than how we are doing it.\n\nWe will create the Heroines transformation by ***uploading different JSON and image files to IPFS, and only modifying the file names while retrieving the token URI*.** As if it were two sides of one same coin. There is no tech innovation here, but this will ensure as much gas as possible as no extra code is written in the contract.\n\n![Switch from Hero to Heroine whenever you want. Cost = 0ETH + gas.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XI7iZg3UIJ-wbq2WqCrte.jpg?height=1080&width=1080)\n\n***These are the essential points of the transformation:***\n\n* You will be able to transform your Hero into a Heroine whenever you want and vice-versa.\n* The Heroines will be available some weeks after the first King's election.\n* The cost for converting your Hero will be 0ETH + gas.\n* Female artists have created our Heroes to ensure they lead the way of \"how a heroine should look like.\"\n* There will be a tool so everyone can see what the counterpart version would look like -even if not visible on marketplaces.", "timestamp": 1653240694, "digest": "rwRckqLH7RZ-zCPspfmfa64oUFMrJ0cwjbSvVT0JJrE", "contributor": "0x3cD877CF87DE6Bfc7f23eB4D0B3C20cb5a6FD080"}

{"id": "VlOwH3hRwLpzkf-cM4KI3L5w7VW0V9Bs5aG4iZfOM_U", "title": "How we found our Teddy :)", "body": "Last summer Sam FaceTime'd me & was talking to me about NFT’s. I knew what NFT’s were before we had that conversation but just never paid attention to it. He said : bro this space is perfect for you, don’t ask me why just go on twitter & join any NFT twitter space and you’ll find your journey, I am so excited to see where this story goes from here…\n\nI still remember saying : bro it’s 4 in the morning rn on a Saturday night and you’re telling me to go on twitter space rn and follow some monkey’s??? lol\n\nIn my mind I was like this dude’s lit & out of his right frame of mind. Finishing our sentences he said Teddy trust me, I know you and I am telling you this is a one way ticket to the life you have always dreamed but never lived and opportunities like this are very hard to find. I just laughed at it and I was like I’ll think about it and let you know…\n\nThen after a week I was playing soccer with Shadow in my backyard thinking about what Sam said the other day and the way he said it it was full of light. I could literally feel those good vibes. Btw Sam is a well known artist in the space, and now after spending all this time in this space I get it why he was hyper that day. Anyways, then I went on my twitter and switched my profile form private to public. I joined my first twitter space, It was with @NFTPrince & NFTsquirrels. Both are living legends and I respect them a lot. They shared tons of selfless advice to me on first day without even knowing who I was, what my real name is, or how I looked like. The knowledge was so valuable that basically I’ve never been rugged / scammed in this space till date. \n\nAfter spending some time in different spaces and observing how everything is working in this ecosystem, I focused on the fundamentals, the way people interact and react with certain things, what values they carried, and how do they find their feeling of importance. It was’nt very difficult for me to figure these things out because of my knowledge & experience with Social Media for over 5 years. I grew 36 million+ followers on Instagram via different entertainment pages and a network of over 250 million+ followers via networking in less than 6 months with just 2,000$ to start with from my college dorm.\n\nDuring that time Bored Ape’s were just flying and they still are but the vibes were immaculate last year you can’t deny that. I literally did a PHD on them and I was just astounded by their story but I was able to relate a lot of it to my life, it was so inspiring and fascinating. I was thinking so much about it, that even in my dreams I was seeing NFT’s all around me and my life changed the night of September 30 when i had that one lucid dream, I decided to do a project to share my story so that others can relate to it and be a part of it. \n\n( Note : This was’nt the main reason for me to do a NFT project. My main goal was and is still the same today that I want to leave this NFT space better than how I found it. )\n\nBack to the story, why Teddy? Well obviously. My friend’s call me Teddy and Teddies have been a part of everyone’s childhood and I believe people will hold on to that tradition forever. They provide us the comfort & companionship, a friend to talk to, and it’s not just kids who benefit from the positive effects of a comforting Teddy squeeze. Teddies are just universal and timeless.\n\nI put all of my traits and character and imagination’s in the art, from my expressions to the way I dress. Some of the assets are added for the aesthetics of the collection. I am not an artist but since I was the character I worked with few freelance artist’s to bring my idea on paper. They asked me for a sketch to give an idea of what I wanted and this is what I sent them lmao 😂😂😂😂😂😂\n\n![ That Yu-Gi-Oh and LV belt part has my heart lmaoooo😭😭😭. Tbh this image is still a lot better than my first one. Btw I am not rich lol, I don't have a AP watch or fancy items.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p7SJwXfpBXm-_G9fiTlu0.jpg?height=1280&width=960)\n\n![This looks decent lol. Lot better than what I came up with.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vxl5Z9dogU0G7wxHt-euI.png?height=1280&width=720)\n\n![That's me on the Left! Dw I am doxed to all our past holder's and lot of people in NFT space know me irl. My identity is just not public in the space atm. I'll reveal it when time is right.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CL1JyGEQS_ynX1v0M1WGn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nBack to the story, so once I got this I reached out to few professional artist’s in my network and I worked with multiple of them to find the perfect Teddy. We wanted to stick with 2D because 3D art is great but the market seemed to be doing well with 2D more than 3D collections. Ofcs art style isn’t the main reason for it but it does play a role. But then I am like let’s take the challenge and create something insane. During the time when I started the project, their were’nt any 3D project’s coming out just yet nor there were any noticeable Teddy Bear collections popping as long as I know. So then we decided to turn this into 3D. During this process one 3D artist reached out to me in my DM’s of one our meme page asking to collab, I am like okay cool lets give it a shot and see what you got. \n\n![This is what he came up with as base model. 💀💀💀](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FcshCcWqBzufElk9puKnW.png?height=772&width=778)\n\nYeah he just lost me on that base model. If ur surprised, I did’nt see this coming either, when I saw it for the first time I was out of words just like you are rn. I seriously had no comments on this image. So yeah I had to say no to that dude and look for another artist. The fact that people fake their LinkedIn and show you proof of work of other artist is just hilarious. So I asked one of my friend on telegram if he knew any artist to connect me and he did. \n\n![Idk tbh, it was just not it.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z3yiJzSTaGmqQdaHZroTJ.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nIt just did’nt feel right going with the full body at this point, gave pfp style a shot and see how it does. Initially the idea was, we will do pfp collection and in a seperate contract and we will give the holders full body version of their Teddy so they have both and can use it the way they like whether to animate or so with the source file…\n\n![I finally said yes to this one and made a deal with the artist and gave her an upfront amount for her time that we both agreed on. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ef-d0SnN5nrZH4EpHIfbn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThe reason why I paid upfront was because she told me she had financial instability and urgently need of money for rent and expenses so she would’nt be able to work full time on this project and it would take lot longer to complete the collection than what I was expecting. Plus I genuinely wanted to help her regardless of if she would work for the project or not due to her situation.\n\n![My mind, Her skills.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q7q8YdENYDP5zDlajLh05.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nWe decided to fully render and rigg the collection in the end after all the traits and assets are illustrated and confirmed so that their isn't any confusions and nothing is left out. But unfortunately she died in a car accident 3 days before our launch. I found out about it next day of her death from my friend I was completely devasted but I was more sad for her and her family. I communicated with our community and told them that guys we do not have the collection fully rigged and its in between 2D and 3D so we would have to pause the project for now until we find another artist and see how things go from there. \n\nBut then I was also out of funds because I put everything I had in the project initially. So I communicated this with the community in our discord and 34 people ended up minting 100 regardless of the situation. 10 were minted for team and 1 was minted by me personally to participate in the process just like any other member of community. They knew that mint had zero value and won’t have a secondary market value but yet they still supported. All they asked me was to not quit on my dream and to the challenge to make a come back from this situation. The collection won’t ever be revealed for the respect and honor of our artist. We communicated this with our holders as well and they are okay with it. A small portion of funds from royalties of our new collection will go towards her Family. Here’s the OpenSea link to that collection :\n\n[https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub](https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub)\n\nThen after I did an outreach again and managed to find a team of 4 professional 3D artist’s. Their past ventures have involved working with brands like Puma, Bangs and Lulu Lemon. Their Identities are anon as they wish to keep it that way but I have confirmed the veracity of their credentials. When I presented this entire idea and vision of the collection to them, after hearing me they instantly said yes and told be that we’re gonna make the best collection of 2022. We started working on it the same day and even with this team, I worked 1 on 1 with the team over screen shares for every single trait’s and asset’s and outcomes are just fantastic. Look It does’nt matter what people think of it but we do believe it is one of the greatest NFT collections that will ever be deployed on Blockchain. We’ve put our blood, sweat and tears in this collection as a team day in and day out. The collection is timeless & it will age well I can make that one promise for sure. \n\n![This collection is dedicated to someone who does'nt need to own it. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wKl-h3xgt9G73xjvxW_7_.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThe story will never have an end to be honest and I am just the captain of the boat as of now but at some point I want to hand the dream over to the community in a position that even if I am not present the story live forever as long as their is imagination left in this world.

{"id": "lIHG8Eoa04PwKjNsr4-_J18_bDEbzLsPrMtXL0oy2uQ", "title": "How we found our Teddy :)", "body": "Last summer Sam FaceTime'd me & was talking to me about NFT’s. I knew what NFT’s were before we had that conversation but just never paid attention to it. He said : bro this space is perfect for you, don’t ask me why just go on twitter & join any NFT twitter space and you’ll find your journey, I am so excited to see where this story goes from here…\n\nI still remember saying : bro it’s 4 in the morning rn on a Saturday night and you’re telling me to go on twitter space rn and follow some monkey’s??? lol\n\nIn my mind I was like this dude’s lit & out of his right frame of mind. Finishing our sentences he said Teddy trust me, I know you and I am telling you this is a one way ticket to the life you have always dreamed but never lived and opportunities like this are very hard to find. I just laughed at it and I was like I’ll think about it and let you know…\n\nThen after a week I was playing soccer with Shadow in my backyard thinking about what Sam said the other day and the way he said it it was full of light. I could literally feel those good vibes. Btw Sam is a well known artist in the space, and now after spending all this time in this space I get it why he was hyper that day. Anyways, then I went on my twitter and switched my profile form private to public. I joined my first twitter space, It was with @NFTPrince & NFTsquirrels. Both are living legends and I respect them a lot. They shared tons of selfless advice to me on first day without even knowing who I was, what my real name is, or how I looked like. The knowledge was so valuable that basically I’ve never been rugged / scammed in this space till date. \n\nAfter spending some time in different spaces and observing how everything is working in this ecosystem, I focused on the fundamentals, the way people interact and react with certain things, what values they carried, and how do they find their feeling of importance. It was’nt very difficult for me to figure these things out because of my knowledge & experience with Social Media for over 5 years. I grew 36 million+ followers on Instagram via different entertainment pages and a network of over 250 million+ followers via networking in less than 6 months with just 2,000$ to start with from my college dorm.\n\nDuring that time Bored Ape’s were just flying and they still are but the vibes were immaculate last year you can’t deny that. I literally did a PHD on them and I was just astounded by their story but I was able to relate a lot of it to my life, it was so inspiring and fascinating. I was thinking so much about it, that even in my dreams I was seeing NFT’s all around me and my life changed the night of September 30 when i had that one lucid dream, I decided to do a project to share my story so that others can relate to it and be a part of it. \n\n( Note : This was’nt the main reason for me to do a NFT project. My main goal was and is still the same today that I want to leave this NFT space better than how I found it. )\n\nBack to the story, why Teddy? Well obviously. My friend’s call me Teddy and Teddies have been a part of everyone’s childhood and I believe people will hold on to that tradition forever. They provide us the comfort & companionship, a friend to talk to, and it’s not just kids who benefit from the positive effects of a comforting Teddy squeeze. Teddies are just universal and timeless.\n\nI put all of my traits and character and imagination’s in the art, from my expressions to the way I dress. Some of the assets are added for the aesthetics of the collection. I am not an artist but since I was the character I worked with few freelance artist’s to bring my idea on paper. They asked me for a sketch to give an idea of what I wanted and this is what I sent them lmao 😂😂😂😂😂😂\n\n![ That Yu-Gi-Oh and LV belt part has my heart lmaoooo😭😭😭.

Presque tous les réseaux blockchain vantent le nombre élevé de transactions par seconde (TPS) comme un argument de vente. Cependant, le TPS n'est pas une mesure valable pour comparer les réseaux blockchain, ce qui rend difficile l'évaluation de leurs performances relatives. De plus, les grands nombres de TPS ont généralement un coût, ce qui pose la question suivante : ces réseaux sont-ils réellement évolutifs ou se contentent-ils d'augmenter leur débit ?\n\nExaminons donc comment définir la scalabilité, quels compromis sont faits pour y parvenir et pourquoi les Validity Rollups constituent la solution la scalabilité par excellence.\n\n### Toutes les transactions ne sont pas égales\n\nTout d'abord, nous devons établir notre affirmation selon laquelle la mesure simple et pratique des TPS ne sont pas une mesure précise de la scalabilité.\n\nPour compenser les nœuds pour l'exécution des transactions (et pour dissuader les utilisateurs de spammer le réseau avec des calculs inutiles), les blockchains facturent des frais proportionnels à la charge de calcul imposée à la blockchain. Dans Ethereum, la complexité de la charge de calcul est mesurée en gas. Le gas étant une mesure très pratique de la complexité des transactions, le terme sera utilisé tout au long de cet article pour les blockchains autres qu'Ethereum, même s'il est généralement spécifique à Ethereum.\n\nLes transactions diffèrent considérablement en termes de complexité et, par conséquent, de quantité de gas qu'elles consomment. Bitcoin, le pionnier des transactions de pair à pair (P2P) trustless, ne prend en charge que le rudimentaire script Bitcoin. Ces simples transferts d'adresse à adresse consomment peu de gas. En revanche, les chaînes de smart contract comme Ethereum ou Solana prennent en charge une machine virtuelle et des langages de programmation complets de Turing qui permettent des transactions beaucoup plus complexes. Par conséquent, les dApps comme Uniswap nécessitent beaucoup plus de gas.\n\nC'est pourquoi il est absurde de comparer les TPS de différentes blockchains. Ce que nous devrions plutôt comparer, c'est la capacité de calcul ou débit.\n\nToutes les blockchains ont une taille de bloc (variable) et un temps de bloc qui déterminent combien d'unités de calcul peuvent être traitées par bloc et à quelle vitesse un nouveau bloc peut être ajouté. Ensemble, ces deux variables déterminent le débit d'une blockchain.\n\n## Qu'est-ce qui limite la scalabilité ?\n\nLes blockchains s'efforcent d'être des réseaux inclusifs et décentralisés au maximum. Pour y parvenir, deux propriétés fondamentales doivent être contrôlées.\n\n### 1. Exigences matérielles\n\nLa décentralisation d'un réseau blockchain est déterminé par la capacité du nœud le plus faible du réseau à vérifier la blockchain et à en conserver l'état. Par conséquent, les coûts de fonctionnement d'un nœud (matériel, bande passante et stockage) doivent être maintenus aussi bas que possible afin de permettre à un maximum d'individus de devenir des participants permissionless au réseau trustless.\n\n### 2. Croissance de l'État\n\nLa croissance de l'état (state growth) fait référence à la vitesse de croissance de la blockchain. Plus le débit d'une blockchain est élevé par unité de temps, plus la blockchain se développe rapidement. Les nœuds complets stockent l'historique du réseau, et ils doivent être en mesure de valider l'état du réseau. L'état d'Ethereum est stocké et référencé à l'aide de structures efficaces telles que des arbres ([arbre de Merkle](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbre_de_Merkle)). Au fur et à mesure que l'état se développe, de nouvelles feuilles et branches sont ajoutées, ce qui rend l'exécution de certaines actions toujours plus complexe et plus longue. Au fur et à mesure que la blockchain s'agrandit, elle empire l’exécution par les nœuds dans le pire des cas, ce qui entraîne un temps toujours plus long pour valider les nouveaux blocs. Au fil du temps, cela augmente également le temps total nécessaire à la synchronisation d'un nœud complet.\n\n## Impacts néfastes de l'augmentation du débit\n\n### 1. Nombre de nœuds\n\nLes exigences minimales pour faire fonctionner un nœud et le nombre de nœuds sont les suivants :\n\n* Bitcoin¹ : 350 Go d'espace disque, connexion 5 Mbit/s, 1 Go de RAM, CPU >1 Ghz. **Nombre de nœuds : \\~10 000**\n* Ethereum² : 500GB+ espace disque SSD, connexion 25 Mbit/s, 4-8GB RAM, CPU 2-4 cores. **Nombre de nœuds : \\~6 000**\n* Solana³ : 1,5 To+ d'espace disque SSD, connexion 300 Mbit/s, 128 Go de RAM, CPU 12+ cœurs. **Nombre de nœuds : \\~1 200**\n\nNotez que plus les exigences en matière de CPU, de bande passante et de stockage pour les nœuds nécessaires au débit d'une blockchain sont élevées, moins il y a de nœuds sur le réseau, ce qui entraîne une décentralisation plus faible et un réseau moins inclusif.\n\n### 2. Temps de synchronisation d'un nœud complet\n\nLorsqu'un nœud fonctionne pour la première fois, il doit se synchroniser avec tous les nœuds existants, télécharger et valider l'état du réseau depuis le bloc de genèse jusqu'à l'extrémité de la chaîne. Ce processus doit être aussi rapide et efficace que possible pour permettre à quiconque d'agir en tant que participant permissionless du protocole.\n\nEn prenant comme indicateur les tests de synchronisation des [nœuds Bitcoin 2020](https://blog.lopp.net/2020-bitcoin-node-performance-tests/) et [2021](https://blog.lopp.net/2021-altcoin-node-sync-tests/) de Jameson Lopp, le tableau 1 compare le temps nécessaire à la synchronisation d'un nœud complet de Bitcoin, d'Ethereum et de Solana sur un PC grand public moyen.\n\n![Tableau 1. Comparaison du débit de la blockchain et de la synchronisation des nœuds](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S0FjQNLqB60bURgiddwGb.png?height=450&width=1400)\n\nLe tableau 1 montre que l'augmentation du débit entraîne des temps de synchronisation plus longs, car de plus en plus de données doivent être traitées et stockées.\n\nBien que des améliorations soient constamment apportées au logiciel des nœuds pour atténuer le défi posé par la croissance de la blockchain (réduction de l'empreinte du disque, vitesses de synchronisation plus rapides, meilleure résistance aux pannes, modularisation de certains composants, etc.\n\n### Comment définir la scalabilité ?\n\nLa scalabilité est le terme le plus mal représenté dans l'espace blockchain. Si l'augmentation du débit est souhaitable, elle n'est qu'une partie du puzzle.\n\n***La scalabilité*** *signifie* ***plus de transactions*** pour le ***même matériel***.\n\nPour cette raison, la scalabilité peut être séparée en deux catégories.\n\n### La scalabilité du séquenceur\n\nLe séquençage décrit l'acte d'ordonner et de traiter les transactions dans un réseau. Comme il a été établi précédemment, toute blockchain pourrait trivialement augmenter son débit en augmentant la taille des blocs et en raccourcissant leur durée jusqu'à un point où l'impact négatif sur sa décentralisation est jugé trop important. Mais le fait d'ajuster ces simples paramètres ne permet pas d'obtenir les améliorations nécessaires. L'EVM d'Ethereum peut, en théorie, [gérer jusqu'à environ 2 000 TPS](https://twitter.com/dankrad/status/1459607325854121989), ce qui est insuffisant pour répondre à la demande d'espace de bloc à long terme. Pour mettre à l'échelle le séquençage, Solana a fait quelques innovations impressionnantes : tirer parti d'un environnement d'exécution parallélisable et d'un mécanisme de consensus astucieux, qui permet un débit bien plus efficace. Mais, malgré ses améliorations, il n'est ni suffisant ni évolutif. À mesure que Solana augmente son débit, les coûts matériels pour faire fonctionner un nœud et traiter les transactions augmentent également.\n\n### Scalabilité de la vérification\n\nLa scalabilité de la vérification décrit des approches qui augmentent le débit sans imposer aux nœuds des coûts matériels toujours plus élevés. Plus précisément, elle fait référence aux innovations cryptographiques telles que les preuves de validité. Elles sont la raison pour laquelle les Validity Rollups peuvent faire évoluer une blockchain de manière durable.\n\n### **Qu'est-ce qu'un Validity Rollup ?**\n\nLes Validity Rollups (également connus sous le nom de \"ZK-Rollups\") déplacent le calcul et le stockage d'état off-chain mais conservent une petite quantité de certaines données on-chain. Un smart contract sur la blockchain sous-jacente maintient la racine de l'état du Rollup. Sur le Rollup, un lot de transactions hautement compressées, ainsi que la racine de l'état actuel, sont envoyés à un Prouveur off-chain. Le Prouveur calcule les transactions, génère une preuve de validité des résultats et de la nouvelle racine d'état, et l'envoie à un Verifieur on-chain. Le vérifieur vérifie la preuve de validité et le smart contract qui maintient l'état du rollup, le met à jour avec le nouvel état fourni par le vérifieur.\n\n### **Comment les Validity Rollup évoluent-ils avec les mêmes exigences matérielles ?**\n\nMême si les Prouveurs nécessitent du matériel haut de gamme, ils n'ont pas d'impact sur la décentralisation d'une blockchain, car la validité des transactions est garantie par des preuves mathématiquement vérifiables.\n\nCe qui importe, ce sont les exigences pour vérifier les preuves. Comme les données impliquées sont hautement compressées et largement abstraites par le calcul, leur impact sur les nœuds de la blockchain sous-jacente est minime.\n\nLes vérifieurs (nœuds Ethereum) n'ont pas besoin de matériel haut de gamme, et la taille des lots n'augmente pas les exigences matérielles. Seules les transitions d'état et une petite quantité de données d'appel doivent être traitées et stockées par les nœuds. Cela permet à tous les nœuds Ethereum de vérifier les lots Validity Rollup en utilisant leur matériel existant.\n\n### **Plus il y a de transactions, moins c'est cher**\n\nDans les blockchains traditionnelles, plus il y a de transactions, plus le coût est élevé pour tout le monde, car l'espace du bloc se remplit et les utilisateurs doivent surenchérir sur le marché des frais pour que leurs transactions soient incluses.\n\nPour un Validity Rollup, cette dynamique est inversée. La vérification d'un lot de transactions sur Ethereum a un certain coût. Au fur et à mesure que le nombre de transactions dans un lot augmente, le coût de vérification du lot augmente à un rythme exponentiellement plus lent. L'ajout d'un plus grand nombre de transactions à un lot entraîne des frais de transaction moins élevés, même si le coût de vérification du lot augmente, car il est amorti sur toutes les transactions du lot. Les modules d'extension de validité veulent qu'un lot contienne le plus grand nombre possible de transactions, afin que les frais de vérification puissent être répartis entre tous les utilisateurs. Au fur et à mesure que la taille du lot augmente jusqu'à l'infini, les frais amortis par transaction convergent vers zéro, c'est-à-dire que plus il y a de transactions dans un Validity Rollup, moins c'est cher pour tout le monde.\n\ndYdX, une dApp alimentée par un Validity Rollup, voit fréquemment des lots de plus de 12 000 transactions. La comparaison de la consommation de gas des mêmes transactions sur le Mainnet et sur un Validity Rollup illustre les gains de scalabilité :\n\nRèglement d'une transaction dYdX sur Ethereum Mainnet : **200 000 gas**\n\nRèglement d'une transaction dYdX sur StarkEx : <**500 gas**\n\nUne autre façon de voir les choses : Le coût principal des Validity Rollups évolue linéairement avec le nombre d'utilisateurs d'un même lot.\n\n### **Pourquoi les Optimistic Rollups ne sont pas aussi scalable qu'on pourrait le penser ?**\n\nEn théorie, les Optimistic Rollups offrent presque les mêmes avantages de scalabilité que les validity rollups. Mais il existe une distinction importante : Les Optimistic Rollups sont optimisés pour le cas moyen, alors que les Validity Rollups sont optimisés pour le cas le plus défavorable.

Ainsi, pour contester une fraude, l'utilisateur doit synchroniser un nœud complet Ethereum, un nœud complet L2, et calculer lui-même la transaction suspecte.\n\nDans le pire des cas, un utilisateur n'aurait qu'à synchroniser un nœud complet Ethereum pour vérifier la preuve de validité, s'épargnant ainsi la charge de calcul.\n\nContrairement aux Validity Rollups, le coût des Optimistic Rollups s'échelonne linéairement avec le nombre de transactions au lieu du nombre d'utilisateurs, ce qui les rend plus chers.\n\n### **Dernière pièce du puzzle - Accès permissionless à l'état du rollup**\n\nPour garantir la validité des transactions, les utilisateurs doivent exécuter un nœud Ethereum uniquement. Cependant, les utilisateurs et les développeurs peuvent vouloir voir, et exécuter, l'état et l'exécution du Rollup à diverses fins. Un nœud L2 d'indexation répond parfaitement à ce besoin. Non seulement il permet aux utilisateurs de voir les transactions dans le réseau, mais il s'agit également d'une pièce essentielle nécessaire au fonctionnement de l'infrastructure de l'écosystème. Les indexeurs comme The Graph, Alchemy, Infura, les réseaux Oracle comme Chainlink, et les explorateurs de blocs, tous sont entièrement pris en charge par un nœud L2 d'indexation permissionless.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDe nombreuses approches pour aborder la scalabilité des blockchains se concentrent à tort sur l'augmentation du débit.

The money circle leaders suffered heavy losses, and the maximum value decreased by nearly 90%", "body": "Cryptocurrency is still being sold, and bitcoin has fallen to its lowest level since December 2020.\n\nMarket data show that bitcoin has fallen for seven consecutive days - the longest consecutive decline since March 2020. On May 12, bitcoin fell below US $27000 / piece again, and other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum could not hide the decline. It fell 13% to less than US $1800 / piece, continuing to brush the new low since July last year. Ethereum fell 19.6% in 24 hours. As of press time, Ethereum has fallen by more than 16% to US $1770 / piece.\n\nIn fact, analysts have always regarded $30000 as an important milestone of bitcoin, and many people expect that once it falls below, its decline may accelerate. Technical analysts said bitcoin now needs to hold the $28000 mark, which could trigger a new wave of selling.\n\nRecently, the US stock market has continued to plummet. Some analysts believe that as traditional funds such as hedge funds and family trusts have entered the field of cryptocurrency in the past two years, digital assets have developed more and more synchronously with stocks. Such funds are more likely to sell cryptocurrency assets during market fluctuations.\n\nAt the same time, cryptocurrency has also been hit by the decoupling of stable currency. The stable currency was originally regarded as the least volatile currency in the cryptocurrency world, linked to the value of the currency issued by the government. However, in the past week, ust was decoupled from the US dollar exchange rate twice. The lowest value of UST, which was supposed to be the anchor of US $1, fell to US $0.65, triggering a crisis of confidence and impacting the overall cryptocurrency market.\n\nPreviously, the sister token Luna of ust was once called “coin circle Maotai” by coin circle players. It soared from the lowest point of US $0.12 to US $119.5, with a maximum market value of US $41 billion (about more than 270 billion yuan). Recently, its price once fell below US $2 and its market value once fell to US $1.1 billion.\n\nAccording to the data of on-line masters under okcloud chain, up to now, 43 companies or institutions, including gray-scale investment, hold 1225600 bitcoins. More than $13 billion of bitcoin held by institutions and companies including Tesla has evaporated. Among them, Aker ASA lost US $21.62 million, metu lost US $19.75 million and plunwra lost US $16.95 million, ranking in the top three. In addition, Tesla holds 40900 bitcoins, with an average price of $32000.\n\nAt the same time, the value of investment leaders has also shrunk due to the recent sharp decline. According to the Bloomberg billionaire index, the personal wealth of coinbase founder Brian Armstrong was $13.7 billion in November last year. So far, his wealth has evaporated by about 83% to $2.3 billion.\n\nCHANGPENG Zhao, chief executive of coin security, suffered more losses than Armstrong. According to the Bloomberg billionaire index in January, Zhao CHANGPENG’s personal wealth was $96 billion, which had been reduced to $11.6 billion as of May 11, with an evaporation rate of nearly 90%.", "timestamp": 1653240790, "digest": "URcFj5oYwpD6ozNBQkZu2SIHPlr-d5wYDqokFQHsLRo", "contributor": "0x50BbaEA569F29abd3c0d95e75A09E4f1876c98E4"}

{"id": "_JlEEPEaYZYjnl5-Gd_UL4q6sI3g6HDVEUh7t-HQRTA", "title": "On Nowness and Collective Memory", "body": "> “It is obvious to everybody that the phenomena of the world are evidently irreversible. I mean things happen that do not happen the other way. You drop a cup and it breaks, and you can sit there a long time waiting for the pieces to come together and jump back into your hand. If you watch the waves of the sea breaking, you can stand there and wait for the great moment when the foam collects together, rises up out of the sea, and falls back farther out from the shore — it would be very pretty!” - Richard Feynman\n\nWe all have an immediate, almost visceral understanding of the distinction between the past and the future, even from the most mundane experiences. We learn from the past, and we plan for the future. We celebrate, we commemorate, we mourn, and we hope. Yet, as Feynman notes, no one would sit and wait after a long enough time for the cup to come back together.\n\nBut although we so clearly understand the distinction between past and future so many of us spend surprisingly little time thinking about the present - the way we cultivate it and the way we become inspired by it. The more I think about it the more surprising this is, since in a sense there is no period quite so long as right now.\n\nMore than anything else this is because *now* is such a slippery concept in the first place. On the one hand, there is a standard notion of *nowness* we’re all naturally in tune with as we check our calendars, our watches, and our phones. On the other, there’s the time we truly *experience*. In ancient Greek, the distinction between kronos (*chronological, measured time*) and [kairos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairos) (*qualitative, lived time*) helped us better understand what we mean by the present moment. Similarly, in Sanskrit, *[ritu](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/ritu#sanskrit)* played a key cultural (and often spiritual) role marking meaningful moments of change.\n\nIn the current day, especially in light of the pandemic, our attention has slowly returned to the concept of lived time as a [subject of analysis](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/how-the-coronavirus-pandemic-is-warping-our-sense-of-time). As we all experienced time dilation together, it became more relevant, and in some ways easier for us to pinpoint just how much of an impact new experiences (and hence new memories) can have on our ability to move from one moment to the next.\n\n## Rhythm, Ritual, and Collective Memory\n\nIn every era the way we each individually interpret time comes with collective consequences. As the origins of words like kairos and ritu suggest, there has always been a sense of life and ripeness that comes with a change in environment, and with new experiences.\n\nSimultaneously, there is a sense of punctuation that comes with *ritual* which guides our ability to recollect our collective memory. Rituals are intentional, repeated moments with others or even with ourselves, which somehow, incredibly, cleanse our spirits and create a renewed sense of novelty (and alter our sense of time). But the types of rituals we take part in have changed extensively over time, with the rise and fall variations of social, political, theological / ecclesiastic tradition, and perhaps most importantly with the rise of new technologies.\n\nThese times of change in ritual haven’t been left unexplored. The ethnographer Arnold van Gennep, anthropologist Victor Turner, and even the psychologist Carl Jung all touched on the notion of liminal phases in which changes in rituals and customs occur – another kind of collective present. Today, people might like to call these changes [vibe shifts](https://www.thecut.com/2022/02/a-vibe-shift-is-coming.html).\n\nWith the ever increasing pace of technology, these shifts are occurring faster than ever. With the introduction of the [printing press](https://fs.blog/memory-printing-press/), we moved from spoken words held in memory to books as the main store of human knowledge.\n\nAs Marshall McLuhan noted, computers, connected via the internet, have further complicated the way we remember and the way we flow through time. Especially in the modern day, we’re constantly bouncing between algorithmically generated and distributed narratives that lack the same weight, the same auras as those that we collectively imagined together.\n\nIt’s no surprise then that the idea of [lore](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1503415155975204864) has resurfaced. But perhaps the most important questions remain unasked: namely, what actions can we take to collectively maintain it?\n\nThere are many answers to this question, and I’m not even certain there’s a right one, but it certainly feels like we need new forms of ritual that we can enact together to draw ourselves back to [intentionality](https://scott.mirror.xyz/U8aWHSX_HHHYcN1GvbTcBnZbAR7eNeJ_61WIOuSguF8); to regain a sense of focus and in turn a sense of true belonging.\n\nExploring these rituals, however, can’t be done in writing. It can’t be done between a writer and an audience. It has to be done together.\n\n*Thanks as always to Andy Tudhope, David Phelps, and Vivek Singh for graciously reviewing this draft. Please note, this draft will likely change over time as I update my thinking and continue to add more depth and context.

Presque tous les réseaux blockchain vantent le nombre élevé de transactions par seconde (TPS) comme un argument de vente. Cependant, le TPS n'est pas une mesure valable pour comparer les réseaux blockchain, ce qui rend difficile l'évaluation de leurs performances relatives. De plus, les grands nombres de TPS ont généralement un coût, ce qui pose la question suivante : ces réseaux sont-ils réellement évolutifs ou se contentent-ils d'augmenter leur débit ?\n\nExaminons donc comment définir la scalabilité, quels compromis sont faits pour y parvenir et pourquoi les Validity Rollups constituent la solution la scalabilité par excellence.\n\n### Toutes les transactions ne sont pas égales\n\nTout d'abord, nous devons établir notre affirmation selon laquelle la mesure simple et pratique des TPS ne sont pas une mesure précise de la scalabilité.\n\nPour compenser les nœuds pour l'exécution des transactions (et pour dissuader les utilisateurs de spammer le réseau avec des calculs inutiles), les blockchains facturent des frais proportionnels à la charge de calcul imposée à la blockchain. Dans Ethereum, la complexité de la charge de calcul est mesurée en gas. Le gas étant une mesure très pratique de la complexité des transactions, le terme sera utilisé tout au long de cet article pour les blockchains autres qu'Ethereum, même s'il est généralement spécifique à Ethereum.\n\nLes transactions diffèrent considérablement en termes de complexité et, par conséquent, de quantité de gas qu'elles consomment. Bitcoin, le pionnier des transactions de pair à pair (P2P) trustless, ne prend en charge que le rudimentaire script Bitcoin. Ces simples transferts d'adresse à adresse consomment peu de gas. En revanche, les chaînes de smart contract comme Ethereum ou Solana prennent en charge une machine virtuelle et des langages de programmation complets de Turing qui permettent des transactions beaucoup plus complexes. Par conséquent, les dApps comme Uniswap nécessitent beaucoup plus de gas.\n\nC'est pourquoi il est absurde de comparer les TPS de différentes blockchains. Ce que nous devrions plutôt comparer, c'est la capacité de calcul ou débit.\n\nToutes les blockchains ont une taille de bloc (variable) et un temps de bloc qui déterminent combien d'unités de calcul peuvent être traitées par bloc et à quelle vitesse un nouveau bloc peut être ajouté. Ensemble, ces deux variables déterminent le débit d'une blockchain.\n\n## Qu'est-ce qui limite la scalabilité ?\n\nLes blockchains s'efforcent d'être des réseaux inclusifs et décentralisés au maximum. Pour y parvenir, deux propriétés fondamentales doivent être contrôlées.\n\n### 1. Exigences matérielles\n\nLa décentralisation d'un réseau blockchain est déterminé par la capacité du nœud le plus faible du réseau à vérifier la blockchain et à en conserver l'état. Par conséquent, les coûts de fonctionnement d'un nœud (matériel, bande passante et stockage) doivent être maintenus aussi bas que possible afin de permettre à un maximum d'individus de devenir des participants permissionless au réseau trustless.\n\n### 2. Croissance de l'État\n\nLa croissance de l'état (state growth) fait référence à la vitesse de croissance de la blockchain. Plus le débit d'une blockchain est élevé par unité de temps, plus la blockchain se développe rapidement. Les nœuds complets stockent l'historique du réseau, et ils doivent être en mesure de valider l'état du réseau. L'état d'Ethereum est stocké et référencé à l'aide de structures efficaces telles que des arbres ([arbre de Merkle](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbre_de_Merkle)). Au fur et à mesure que l'état se développe, de nouvelles feuilles et branches sont ajoutées, ce qui rend l'exécution de certaines actions toujours plus complexe et plus longue. Au fur et à mesure que la blockchain s'agrandit, elle empire l’exécution par les nœuds dans le pire des cas, ce qui entraîne un temps toujours plus long pour valider les nouveaux blocs. Au fil du temps, cela augmente également le temps total nécessaire à la synchronisation d'un nœud complet.\n\n## Impacts néfastes de l'augmentation du débit\n\n### 1. Nombre de nœuds\n\nLes exigences minimales pour faire fonctionner un nœud et le nombre de nœuds sont les suivants :\n\n* Bitcoin¹ : 350 Go d'espace disque, connexion 5 Mbit/s, 1 Go de RAM, CPU >1 Ghz. **Nombre de nœuds : \\~10 000**\n* Ethereum² : 500GB+ espace disque SSD, connexion 25 Mbit/s, 4-8GB RAM, CPU 2-4 cores. **Nombre de nœuds : \\~6 000**\n* Solana³ : 1,5 To+ d'espace disque SSD, connexion 300 Mbit/s, 128 Go de RAM, CPU 12+ cœurs. **Nombre de nœuds : \\~1 200**\n\nNotez que plus les exigences en matière de CPU, de bande passante et de stockage pour les nœuds nécessaires au débit d'une blockchain sont élevées, moins il y a de nœuds sur le réseau, ce qui entraîne une décentralisation plus faible et un réseau moins inclusif.\n\n### 2. Temps de synchronisation d'un nœud complet\n\nLorsqu'un nœud fonctionne pour la première fois, il doit se synchroniser avec tous les nœuds existants, télécharger et valider l'état du réseau depuis le bloc de genèse jusqu'à l'extrémité de la chaîne. Ce processus doit être aussi rapide et efficace que possible pour permettre à quiconque d'agir en tant que participant permissionless du protocole.\n\nEn prenant comme indicateur les tests de synchronisation des [nœuds Bitcoin 2020](https://blog.lopp.net/2020-bitcoin-node-performance-tests/) et [2021](https://blog.lopp.net/2021-altcoin-node-sync-tests/) de Jameson Lopp, le tableau 1 compare le temps nécessaire à la synchronisation d'un nœud complet de Bitcoin, d'Ethereum et de Solana sur un PC grand public moyen.\n\n![Tableau 1. Comparaison du débit de la blockchain et de la synchronisation des nœuds](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S0FjQNLqB60bURgiddwGb.png?height=450&width=1400)\n\nLe tableau 1 montre que l'augmentation du débit entraîne des temps de synchronisation plus longs, car de plus en plus de données doivent être traitées et stockées.\n\nBien que des améliorations soient constamment apportées au logiciel des nœuds pour atténuer le défi posé par la croissance de la blockchain (réduction de l'empreinte du disque, vitesses de synchronisation plus rapides, meilleure résistance aux pannes, modularisation de certains composants, etc.\n\n### Comment définir la scalabilité ?\n\nLa scalabilité est le terme le plus mal représenté dans l'espace blockchain. Si l'augmentation du débit est souhaitable, elle n'est qu'une partie du puzzle.\n\n***La scalabilité*** *signifie* ***plus de transactions*** pour le ***même matériel***.\n\nPour cette raison, la scalabilité peut être séparée en deux catégories.\n\n### La scalabilité du séquenceur\n\nLe séquençage décrit l'acte d'ordonner et de traiter les transactions dans un réseau. Comme il a été établi précédemment, toute blockchain pourrait trivialement augmenter son débit en augmentant la taille des blocs et en raccourcissant leur durée jusqu'à un point où l'impact négatif sur sa décentralisation est jugé trop important. Mais le fait d'ajuster ces simples paramètres ne permet pas d'obtenir les améliorations nécessaires. L'EVM d'Ethereum peut, en théorie, [gérer jusqu'à environ 2 000 TPS](https://twitter.com/dankrad/status/1459607325854121989), ce qui est insuffisant pour répondre à la demande d'espace de bloc à long terme. Pour mettre à l'échelle le séquençage, Solana a fait quelques innovations impressionnantes : tirer parti d'un environnement d'exécution parallélisable et d'un mécanisme de consensus astucieux, qui permet un débit bien plus efficace. Mais, malgré ses améliorations, il n'est ni suffisant ni évolutif. À mesure que Solana augmente son débit, les coûts matériels pour faire fonctionner un nœud et traiter les transactions augmentent également.\n\n### Scalabilité de la vérification\n\nLa scalabilité de la vérification décrit des approches qui augmentent le débit sans imposer aux nœuds des coûts matériels toujours plus élevés. Plus précisément, elle fait référence aux innovations cryptographiques telles que les preuves de validité. Elles sont la raison pour laquelle les Validity Rollups peuvent faire évoluer une blockchain de manière durable.\n\n### **Qu'est-ce qu'un Validity Rollup ?**\n\nLes Validity Rollups (également connus sous le nom de \"ZK-Rollups\") déplacent le calcul et le stockage d'état off-chain mais conservent une petite quantité de certaines données on-chain. Un smart contract sur la blockchain sous-jacente maintient la racine de l'état du Rollup. Sur le Rollup, un lot de transactions hautement compressées, ainsi que la racine de l'état actuel, sont envoyés à un Prouveur off-chain. Le Prouveur calcule les transactions, génère une preuve de validité des résultats et de la nouvelle racine d'état, et l'envoie à un Verifieur on-chain. Le vérifieur vérifie la preuve de validité et le smart contract qui maintient l'état du rollup, le met à jour avec le nouvel état fourni par le vérifieur.\n\n### **Comment les Validity Rollup évoluent-ils avec les mêmes exigences matérielles ?**\n\nMême si les Prouveurs nécessitent du matériel haut de gamme, ils n'ont pas d'impact sur la décentralisation d'une blockchain, car la validité des transactions est garantie par des preuves mathématiquement vérifiables.\n\nCe qui importe, ce sont les exigences pour vérifier les preuves. Comme les données impliquées sont hautement compressées et largement abstraites par le calcul, leur impact sur les nœuds de la blockchain sous-jacente est minime.\n\nLes vérifieurs (nœuds Ethereum) n'ont pas besoin de matériel haut de gamme, et la taille des lots n'augmente pas les exigences matérielles. Seules les transitions d'état et une petite quantité de données d'appel doivent être traitées et stockées par les nœuds. Cela permet à tous les nœuds Ethereum de vérifier les lots Validity Rollup en utilisant leur matériel existant.\n\n### **Plus il y a de transactions, moins c'est cher**\n\nDans les blockchains traditionnelles, plus il y a de transactions, plus le coût est élevé pour tout le monde, car l'espace du bloc se remplit et les utilisateurs doivent surenchérir sur le marché des frais pour que leurs transactions soient incluses.\n\nPour un Validity Rollup, cette dynamique est inversée. La vérification d'un lot de transactions sur Ethereum a un certain coût. Au fur et à mesure que le nombre de transactions dans un lot augmente, le coût de vérification du lot augmente à un rythme exponentiellement plus lent. L'ajout d'un plus grand nombre de transactions à un lot entraîne des frais de transaction moins élevés, même si le coût de vérification du lot augmente, car il est amorti sur toutes les transactions du lot. Les modules d'extension de validité veulent qu'un lot contienne le plus grand nombre possible de transactions, afin que les frais de vérification puissent être répartis entre tous les utilisateurs. Au fur et à mesure que la taille du lot augmente jusqu'à l'infini, les frais amortis par transaction convergent vers zéro, c'est-à-dire que plus il y a de transactions dans un Validity Rollup, moins c'est cher pour tout le monde.\n\ndYdX, une dApp alimentée par un Validity Rollup, voit fréquemment des lots de plus de 12 000 transactions. La comparaison de la consommation de gas des mêmes transactions sur le Mainnet et sur un Validity Rollup illustre les gains de scalabilité :\n\nRèglement d'une transaction dYdX sur Ethereum Mainnet : **200 000 gas**\n\nRèglement d'une transaction dYdX sur StarkEx : <**500 gas**\n\nUne autre façon de voir les choses : Le coût principal des Validity Rollups évolue linéairement avec le nombre d'utilisateurs d'un même lot.\n\n### **Pourquoi les Optimistic Rollups ne sont pas aussi scalable qu'on pourrait le penser ?**\n\nEn théorie, les Optimistic Rollups offrent presque les mêmes avantages de scalabilité que les validity rollups. Mais il existe une distinction importante : Les Optimistic Rollups sont optimisés pour le cas moyen, alors que les Validity Rollups sont optimisés pour le cas le plus défavorable. Les systèmes de blockchain fonctionnant dans des conditions extrêmement défavorables, l'optimisation pour le pire des cas est le seul moyen d'assurer la sécurité.\n\nDans le pire cas du **Optimistic Rollups,** les transactions d'un utilisateur ne seront pas vérifiées par les contrôleurs de fraude. Ainsi, pour contester une fraude, l'utilisateur doit synchroniser un nœud complet Ethereum, un nœud complet L2, et calculer lui-même la transaction suspecte.\n\nDans le pire des cas, un utilisateur n'aurait qu'à synchroniser un nœud complet Ethereum pour vérifier la preuve de validité, s'épargnant ainsi la charge de calcul.\n\nContrairement aux Validity Rollups, le coût des Optimistic Rollups s'échelonne linéairement avec le nombre de transactions au lieu du nombre d'utilisateurs, ce qui les rend plus chers.\n\n### **Dernière pièce du puzzle - Accès permissionless à l'état du rollup**\n\nPour garantir la validité des transactions, les utilisateurs doivent exécuter un nœud Ethereum uniquement. Cependant, les utilisateurs et les développeurs peuvent vouloir voir, et exécuter, l'état et l'exécution du Rollup à diverses fins. Un nœud L2 d'indexation répond parfaitement à ce besoin. Non seulement il permet aux utilisateurs de voir les transactions dans le réseau, mais il s'agit également d'une pièce essentielle nécessaire au fonctionnement de l'infrastructure de l'écosystème. Les indexeurs comme The Graph, Alchemy, Infura, les réseaux Oracle comme Chainlink, et les explorateurs de blocs, tous sont entièrement pris en charge par un nœud L2 d'indexation permissionless.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDe nombreuses approches pour aborder la scalabilité des blockchains se concentrent à tort sur l'augmentation du débit.

{"id": "rPBNfJQ1QAgTwWJsofVA7RXpd3zI1Z9Z64Nb5lmh4Qk", "title": "Can roast + complaining solve the problem? CBA signboards need to be jointly maintained", "body": "In the ninth round of CBA League, in a focus duel between Liaoning and Shanxi, the scores of the two teams have been completely opened in the second half, and the game has lost suspense early. However, Guo Allen, a player of Liaoning team, complained that the referee was expelled after an attack, which has become the focus of the game.\n\nAfter the game, Guo Allen directly made a comment on social media, “I can’t understand. It’s a joke. I’ll play games. Bye.”\n\nComments about referees and players spread all over the comment area. Soon after, the topic of “Guo Allen was expelled” rushed to the microblog hot search, and it still topped the list hot search this morning. It can be seen that everyone’s attention to this matter is far more than the game itself.\n\nFrom the perspective of slow motion, Aaron Guo’s layup was indeed suspected of being violated, but the referee could not guarantee that every penalty would be foolproof for other objective reasons such as angle on the court. We can only maximize the fairness of the players of the two teams, not to mention the uncertainty of competitive sports is also an attractive factor.\n\nOf course, Aaron Guo’s complaint has his reasons, but his improper speech directly led him to two consecutive technical fouls and was finally expelled. For Guo Allen, it’s natural that some dumb people have a hard feeling of eating Coptis chinensis. They themselves suffer a loss. They find the referee to reason, but they suffer again.\n\nAs a player, respect the rules and face up to the problems. Even if you suffer a loss on the court, you can go through the appeal channel and ask the relevant departments to watch the video. If you compete directly with the referee on the court, the irrational athlete will naturally become the object of punishment. He will be wronged himself, which will only make him more embarrassed.\n\nAfter Aaron Guo was expelled, I believe the CBA alliance will not turn a blind eye to his words on social media. According to the ticket issued by CBA League this season, Aaron Guo may be fined or even suspended.\n\nIn the match between Guangzhou and Jilin this week, Guangzhou head coach Guo Shiqiang was directly suspended for five games and fined 20000 yuan because he complained about the referee and made a scene on the technical stage. Zhao Rui was suspended for one match and fined 50000 yuan for judging with his fingers and using insulting language. These two tickets related to referees can be seen from a certain extent that the CBA alliance is protecting referees and strictly implementing the rules. Of course, the protection of referees is not biased. There are major omissions and misjudgments, and CBA also has a corresponding punishment mechanism for referees. For example, the referees and technical representatives of law enforcement Guangzhou and Jilin have been criticized internally, and there is even news that they have been suspended.\n\nAlthough referees often become the object of roast, people should communicate or appeal in appropriate ways. Blindly pushing the referee to the commanding height of public opinion will only make everyone watch the game with colored glasses and can’t appreciate the charm of competitive sports itself.\n\nOf course, the remarks made by Liaoning team head coach Yang Ming at the post game press conference are worth praising for him. As the coach of the team and the coach of Aaron Guo, he apologized to the outside world for his players in front of the media. “The only deficiency is that Allen apologized to everyone and the referee through the media lens. (Guo Allen) the team will summarize the complaints about the referee’s decision, and strive for the coaching team to master the field environment and the scale of the referee’s decision in the future, so as not to make similar mistakes.” Yang Ming’s remarks set a good example for the whole team and even the whole league.\n\nUnder the background of the epidemic, CBA League has always been forging ahead and continuing the closed management of the tournament system. It is very difficult for 20 teams, including the referees. When the CBA League is in trouble, we need to work together to maintain the image of the league. Superstars, CBA League and fans are duty bound to work together to overcome difficulties and create a better environment for the CBA League.", "timestamp": 1653241471, "digest": "MvchtL0K7JdHYg3PAiFK7SvGq73X2FUulwe2RNjuTzA", "contributor": "0x2eC42C830Ed1356983C3818DFf57B51C4b60bbe9"}
{"id": "3uEv8Ewj-PG7gJasmJ0aBy1LiK0YG2F2CL1BVDCPm1E", "title": "The auto market falls into recession, and the repair must grasp three key points", "body": "The supply chain crisis, accompanied by the conversion of popular models, jointly led to the decline of the car market in early 2022. After the market has identified the new hot spot of “new energy + economic models”, whether several star products can be born in the second quarter to stimulate the rapid recovery of the market has become the key to whether China’s auto market can maintain growth or at least avoid a serious recession in 2022.\n\nWen Yinlu editor mark\n\nThe passenger car market joint conference (hereinafter referred to as the passenger car Association), China Automobile Industry Association and China Automobile Circulation Association have successively released the key operation data of China’s automobile market in April 2022 in the past few days. The data performance is expected to be very depressed. In addition, more than expected, not only the production end is seriously damaged, but also the sales end data is obviously weak, and the production and sales ends are under pressure. The second quarter of this year has become a key window period for the repair of the automobile market.\n\nAfter in-depth communication with many OEMs and dealers, Caijing eleven believes that there are three key points to repair the car market:\n\n 1. Dredge the capillaries of the supply chain.\n 2. 2. It is urgent to bail out dealers.\n 3. 3. The integration of car enterprises follows the hot spot transformation of the car market.\n 4. Supply chain repair more difficult than expected\n 5. The impact of this round of epidemic on automobile production is comparable to that when the epidemic just broke out in 2020. According to the data released by the passenger Federation, 969000 passenger cars were produced in April, down 41.1% year-on-year and 46.8% month on month, which is under great pressure. The last time the monthly output of passenger cars was less than one million was in February and March 2020, 208000 and 975000 respectively.\n 6. The decline rates of production at different levels are as follows: luxury brands decreased by 57% year-on-year and 43% month on month; Joint venture brands decreased by 56% year-on-year and 58% month on month; Independent brands decreased by 20% year-on-year and 38% month on month. The biggest reason for the decline of joint venture brands is that many car companies are located in Shanghai and Changchun, which are seriously affected by the epidemic. In April, the production of five major automobile enterprises in Shanghai decreased by 75% month on month compared with March, the production of joint venture major automobile enterprises in Changchun decreased by 54% month on month, and the overall decline in other regions was 38%.\n 7. The supply chain crisis has led to more than one million production cuts. After entering may, although the situation has improved, the impact is still not optimistic. Changchun has basically completed the restoration of production order, but there are many difficulties in resuming production in Shanghai. The automobile supply chain is very long. It is difficult to cover all key enterprises in the supply chain through the permission of the white list.\n 8. Chen Yudong, President of Bosch China, said that although the two batches of white lists released in Shanghai have covered more than 2000 enterprises, and most of the first-class suppliers of Bosch and Bosch are in the “white list”, the suppliers of Bosch suppliers are not necessarily in the “white list”, and the supply chain cannot form a chain, so products cannot be produced in the end.\n 9. For example, Chen Yudong said, “we have a coating supplier. The company is in Shanghai and the scale is very small. In this case, it is difficult to resume work, but if the supplier does not resume work, it will affect the production of the whole chain. In the later stage, we also helped the company resume work through various coordination.”\n10. The madness of competing for upstream supply is also affecting the progress of resumption of production. At present, the supply capacity of upstream suppliers is very limited. When competing for the supply of goods, there are even buyers blocking the door with cash. As long as there are goods, the buyer will take care of them all. This gave birth to a phenomenon. One of the two enterprises grabbed part a and the other grabbed Part B. as a result, the two enterprises didn’t spend less money, but the parts were still incomplete and could not resume production smoothly.\n11. Logistics and accessories are the two major problems faced by the current auto enterprises. If these problems are not solved, even if the workers can return to their posts smoothly, they will face the situation of no work to start. From April 18 to the end of the month, there are 11 working days. SAIC passenger car port base produced more than 2400 vehicles in April and Tesla produced 10757 vehicles in April, both of which are less than half of the normal production capacity. Chen Yudong also confirmed that although Bosch’s factories are in production and operation, the degree of capacity recovery is not optimistic. On the whole, the degree of capacity recovery is about 30% - 75%.\n12. Although the repair road of the whole automobile supply chain is blocked and long, the trend is obviously improving. Cui Dongshu, Secretary General of the Federation, revealed at the sales data release and communication meeting on May 10 that the delivery data in the first week of May had been significantly improved compared with the last week of April. With the continuous improvement of epidemic control in Shanghai, the repair of supply chain will be significantly accelerated. At present, compared with the difficulties of vehicle manufacturers, the plight of dealers in direct contact with consumers needs more attention.\n13. Dealers are more difficult than vehicle manufacturers\n14. The difficulties of vehicle manufacturers have become the focus of the whole society, but the difficulties of dealers have not been paid enough attention. According to the data released by China Automobile Circulation Association, among the 94 City samples surveyed, dealers in 34 cities have closed their stores due to epidemic prevention and control, mostly in first tier cities. More than 60% of the dealers who closed their stores for more than a week. Most dealers said they could not complete the sales task of the current month. More than 70% of dealers with a completion rate of less than 70% and more than 40% of dealers with a completion rate of less than half. At present, some car enterprises have reduced the task assessment indicators for dealers.\n15. Key data reflect the severity of the problem. At present, the dealer’s inventory coefficient (inventory coefficient = ending inventory / current sales volume) is 1.91, which is the highest value since March 2020. From February to April this year, the inventory coefficients are 1.85, 1.75 and 1.91 respectively, significantly exceeding the boom and bust line of 1.50, and increasing year-on-year for three consecutive months.\n16. Source: China Automobile Circulation Association\n17. According to the analysis of the passenger Association, the proportion of in transit inventory has increased, and the production of some popular models is in shortage, resulting in the mismatch of supply and demand structure and great difficulty in adjustment; The lack of retail increment of popular models also makes the inventory coefficient falsely high.\n18. However, the false high coefficient does not mean that the damage to dealers is false. The dealer inventory early warning index released by China Automobile Circulation Association in April was 66.4%, while the rise and fall line of this index was 50%. The early warning index in April was the highest value since February 2020, and the early warning index has risen continuously since February 2022. Unlike the inventory coefficient, which only calculates a single index, the early warning index integrates the total demand of the automobile market, the customer volume of 4S stores, the transaction rate, price changes and sales changes\n19.

The community can create any World that can be prototyped.**\n\nThe idea that web3 can inform the design of a better tomorrow, and that the Web3 community is a disrupting force that can provoke better societies into existence is a powerful one to explore, envision, and question. If proven true then it is a movement.\n\n**Web3 systems can provoke themselves into existence**\n\n\"Web3 has stunned the world by forging a parallel system of finance of unprecedented flexibility and creativity in less than a decade.\" This demonstrates that within the online bubble of the internet \"Web3 systems can provoke themselves into existence\". This is largely true because social consensus and economic incentives are embedded into their design and enforced at deployment. \n\n**Can we design and build cyber-physical systems to capitalize on the promise of Web3 and provoke a better future?**\n\nThis promising transformational power, if indeed exists, remains unused in large-scale constructs that bridge the cyber and physical worlds such as private cities, because it is too complex and daunting for anyone to tackle alone. \n\nIn one aspect this is because web3 technology is a stack of abstract protocols that makes it very difficult for technical and non-technical users to imagine future realities and alternative worlds that may become available to us by hierarchical assemblies of lego-code blocks. \n\n**Is there a need for a decentralized agency to design, research, and prototype future realities?**\n\nIn this era of unprecedented change, no single team or organization can begin to design unexpected solutions that disrupt conventional thinking without deep collaboration between ecosystem players, communities, and local governance. The fact that there is no easy way to imagine future worlds build with this futuristic technologies, the uncertainty, and other factors are limiting the potential of society to use Web3 in full force. As an example we bring the potential of a Web3 city of 5 M people that could generate an annual product of five hundred Million Ether the equivalent of one Trillion USD.\n\n**Why the Web3 community needs World Building Prototyping?**\n\nWeb3 Synthetic Worlds provides the opportunity for a unique and unparallel experimental environment to: design, prototype, and test complex \\[socio-economic and political \\] systems of regional scale. In doing so, they allow us to not just tinker with the status quo, but to dismantle it and build something better in its place. \n\nBy prototyping projective futures we can show people that other realities are possible and that web3 can help us get there. If we can show that web3 can help to create a brighter future and we map the path to it, many of us will all rush towards that outcome. \n\n**What kind of a decentralized design agency do we imagine?**\n\nThis design initiative finds it attractive to follow an approach modeled as an agency that works on behalf of the Web3 community and ecosystem to help envision the potential of Web3 to its fullest extent through prototyping new worlds that we haven't seen before. This d.agency, is coming together to work with the community to drive the future of Web3 and help put the community at the center of this movement. \n\nThe success of this experiment is based on our ability to create value for citizens and society. Providing a way to align incentives to attract participation and share the benefits of future outcomes is central to our vision for fairness and justice.\n\n\\[This is a draft, a living document.

This is because all hardware wallets that require signing of transactions would have to be compromised *simultaneously* in order for an attacker to steal the funds, which would be extremely hard to do if you use hardware wallets from different vendors.\n\n正如 Michael Flaxman 在此[播客](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/97/)中所提到的，多重簽名錢包中每增加一個簽名者，安全性就會提高一個等級，即使增加的簽名方是閉源硬件錢包。因為如果攻擊著想要攻擊一筆多簽交易，他就必須攻擊所有參與簽名的硬件錢包。如果您使用的是來自不同供應商的硬件錢包，那這種情況將難以實現。\n\n目前，我們以經完成了與 [Gnosis Safe](https://support.keyst.one/3rd-party-wallets/defi-dapp-with-keystone/gnosis-safe)、 [Blue Wallet](https://support.keyst.one/v/traditional-chinese/di-san-fang-qian-bao/bi-te-bi-qian-bao/bluewallet)、[Spectre](https://support.keyst.one/v/traditional-chinese/di-san-fang-qian-bao/bi-te-bi-qian-bao/specter)、[Wasabi Wallet](https://support.keyst.one/v/traditional-chinese/di-san-fang-qian-bao/bi-te-bi-qian-bao/wasabi)、[Sparrow](https://support.keyst.one/v/traditional-chinese/di-san-fang-qian-bao/bi-te-bi-qian-bao/sparrow)、[BTCPay Server](https://support.keyst.one/v/traditional-chinese/di-san-fang-qian-bao/bi-te-bi-qian-bao/btcpay-server)、[Electrum Wallet](https://support.keyst.one/v/traditional-chinese/di-san-fang-qian-bao/bi-te-bi-qian-bao/electrum)、Fully Noded 等多個數字貨幣錢包的兼容，並且支持 PSBT 多重簽名。多重簽名被認為是安全儲存數字貨幣的[最佳選擇](https://twitter.com/mflaxman/status/1310580116808970240)，用戶可以使用 Keystone 硬件錢包作為簽名者創建多重簽名錢包，以此驗證未簽名的多重簽名交易。您可以在[本文](https://medium.com/shiftcrypto/the-pitfalls-of-multisig-when-using-hardware-wallets-9b0e98e4c19c)中查看此功能的重要性。\n\n## 下一步計畫\n\n目前，為了防止網絡釣魚攻擊，Keystone 僅允許用戶通過簽名的固件包進行升級， Ledger、Trezor 和 Keepkey 用戶最近都成為網絡釣魚攻擊的受害者。所以只是單單提醒用戶謹慎安裝第三方固件不足以應對威脅，因為並非所有用戶都具備必要的背景知識，能意識到固件升級過程中潛在的網絡攻擊。\n\n僅允許由我們簽署的固件包進行升級確實防範了大量網絡攻擊，但也有缺點，那就是用戶必須信任我們發布的固件升級包。為了減小這種信任，並滿足那些想要自定義固件的高級用戶，我們未來會發布 Cypherpunk 版本的 Keystone，這個版本的 Keystone 不再預裝任何固件，因此用戶必須編譯自己的固件，在 Github 上選擇可用的私鑰進行簽名，並且，用戶可以自行替換升級包校驗的秘鑰對，從而只識別用戶自行簽名的升級包。\n\n作為目前區塊鏈社區中支持[多重簽名這一最佳解決方案](https://twitter.com/mflaxman/status/1310580116808970240)的一員，我們非常自豪地告訴大家，我們與 [Nunchuk](https://nunchuk.io/)、[ColdCard](https://coldcard.com/) 和 [BitBox](https://shiftcrypto.ch/) 的開發人員一起起草了 [BIP129](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0129.mediawiki)（比特幣安全多重簽名設置，BSMS ）。該 BIP 將比特幣多重簽名的安全性，提升到了一個全新的水平。不久的將來，我們也將實施此 BIP 準則。\n\n# 羅馬不是一天建成的\n\n關於開源，我們為什麼要一步一步實現？有這樣幾個原因。首先，我們有責任保護我們的用戶免受日益增加的黑客攻擊，而將代碼開源的同時也將暴露漏洞，行業內有一句話：「security through obscurity」。所以，Keystone 硬件錢包開源的同時也產生了新的潛在威脅。我們需要執行更嚴格的代碼標準，對這些漏洞進行分析修復，然後才能發布。\n\n世界上沒有絕對的事情，也沒有任何電子產品永遠是完全透明100%開源的，但開源對區塊鏈社區來說仍然非常重要。開源代碼不僅使內部工程師作惡變得更加困難，而且還能促進硬件錢包與軟件錢包等其他產品的集成。現在我們的產品與其他軟件錢包的兼容性越來越高，這也是我們理應為比特幣社區做出的貢獻，同時這也有助於減少用戶對我們產品的信任依賴。", "timestamp": 1653241826, "digest": "iLJF6Da4LgtnfdhIyWtNW67rEij1ld6pwxItNlN9_6w", "contributor": "0xaFEF3a80B6A205d1F74aaC7887e96A0F6F6051e0"}

Zhuang Guotai, Secretary of the Party group and director of the China Meteorological Administration, put forward clear requirements for strengthening meteorological disaster monitoring and early warning and cooperating with relevant departments to do a good job in disaster prevention and reduction. Yu Yong, member of the Party group and deputy director of the Bureau, deployed the next work.\n\nThe meeting pointed out that the China Meteorological Administration attached great importance to the strongest precipitation process in the South since the flood season. Local meteorological support services continued to follow up and took strong actions, showing a good trend of early prediction, early service, good linkage and good effect. Meteorological departments at all levels should implement the concept of “people first and life first”, continue to cooperate with relevant departments to do a good job, and earnestly build the first line of defense for meteorological disaster prevention and reduction.\n\nThe meeting made arrangements for the next work:\n\nFirst, we should strengthen monitoring, forecasting and early warning services. The heavy precipitation process is still continuing and is in the critical period of defense. Meteorological departments at all levels should continue to maintain the combat state, make persistent efforts, strengthen rolling monitoring, consultation, research and judgment, give full play to the advantages of modern meteorological monitoring means, strengthen short-term approach prediction, and go all out to provide monitoring and prediction services.\n\nSecond, service tips should be provided for possible subsequent secondary disasters. The precipitation lasts for a long time. We should pay close attention to the secondary disasters that may induce mountain torrents, geological disasters and other disasters, as well as the disaster risks such as over alarm of small and medium-sized rivers and waterlogging in urban and rural areas, and timely follow up and optimize the service tips.\n\nThird, we should continue to strengthen information submission and public science popularization. Fully understand the importance of all parties to the heavy precipitation process, timely and authoritative release of meteorological monitoring actual information and rolling forecast and early warning, strengthen close cooperation with relevant departments, timely report to Party committees and governments at all levels, timely inform the public and popularize science.\n\nFourth, we should make an overall plan for the current cold air in the north and heavy rainfall in the south. At present, the process of cold air in the north is extreme. In particular, it is necessary to strengthen the analysis of the impact of cold air on epidemic prevention and control and agricultural production, and provide targeted decision-making services by comparing historical data with big data. The South should beware of secondary disasters that may be induced by early precipitation accumulation.", "timestamp": 1653242336, "digest": "8tkoBLJtPE_0rze45uBwUt3Dz1EvGQ0Fic_Gzm4yThQ", "contributor": "0xeb948025a9113a2390E01a455Fda18B2D425254B"}

The big publishing platforms and leading influencers control most of the traffic which allows them to charge exorbitant pay-to-be-seen fees. This and other supporting factors, especially the drive to boost revenue by publishing a lot of content, result in a prohibitively over-priced and over-crowded innovation showcase stage that favors the rich and savvy over the viable, technologically-sound and value-adding. It is like looking for someone you haven’t met yet, in a dark and noisy nightclub with a high probability they didn’t even clear the bouncer…\n\n# Mission — Marco! Polo!\n\nOrchestra’s mission is to help all interested parties in the Crypto/web3 innovation space to find each other on a level playing field.\n\n# Strategy — Come together\n\n![Come together](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z546IYK0oa5WrqwBNjuFt.png?height=787&width=1400)\n\nWe’ll do this by both removing obstacles and by paving inroads.\n\nIn removing obstacles we mean getting rid of the “noise” created by the current unnatural selection process, i.e., merit-centric curation of strong and reputable pool of Good Innovation Projects (GIPs). In “paving inroads” we mean providing a communal virtual space and conditions that would foster interactions with and in a community of innovation supporters (e.g., investors, partners, OGs, KOLs, journalists, publishers, influencers, and other interested parties we can’t think of right now).\n\nAs can be inferred, we believe that collaboration is a necessary condition for effective innovation. We also believe that given the right conditions, collaboration happens naturally. What we mean is that if we are able to bring people together in a way that provides a good match in terms of resources, needs and mutual interests, they will do the rest on their own.\n\n# Organization — Orchestra is a {Set}\n\nOrchestra is not a website (mobile or otherwise), not a Discord channel (nor Telegram group or any other social platform collective noun), not a platform, not a company, an association or any other legal entity. Orchestra will most probably include some or all of the objects above. However, Orchestra is not defined by any of them.\n\nOrchestra is an organization. In “organization” we mean that it is a set of people that 1) identify as belonging to that set, and 2) are accepted by (enough) other members of the set as belonging to that set, and 3) that act in a way that affects other members of the set. The source of the sense of belonging in our case stems from a shared purpose.

How to make up for it?", "body": "Xinhua news agency, Beijing, May 12 - question: what are the shortcomings of flood control since the strongest rainfall this year? How to make up for it?\n\nXinhua News Agency reporter\n\nAt 18:00 on the 11th, the Central Meteorological Observatory issued the first orange rainstorm warning this year, suggesting that many provinces in southern China will usher in heavy rain, and there will be heavy rain in some areas. It is reported that this is the strongest rainfall since the flood season in the south. What are the shortcomings of flood control in China? How to make up the local short board? Xinhua News Agency reporters conducted interviews in many places.\n\nThe flood control situation is still grim\n\nIn recent days, Guo Jianliang, director of the office of the flood control and drought relief headquarters in Nanxian County, Yiyang City, Hunan Province, has been busy. He should not only organize flood fighting and rescue training, but also arrange personnel to keep an eye on the changes of the flood situation. Once the water situation is severe, he should also organize personnel to patrol the embankment for danger investigation. He told reporters: “Dongting Lake area is the ‘main battlefield’ for flood control and flood fighting. After entering the flood season, we are highly nervous.”\n\nAccording to the analysis and prediction from meteorological and hydrological departments, the flood control situation in many places this year is relatively severe.\n\nMa Jianhua, executive deputy commander-in-chief of the Yangtze River flood control and Drought Relief Headquarters, said that it is predicted that the precipitation in the flood season of the Yangtze River Basin this year is normal and less, but the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation is extremely uneven, the risk of regional floods in the upstream is high, the probability of drought and water shortage in the middle and lower reaches is high, and the possibility of drought and flood coexisting is high.\n\n“Flood risk is still the biggest threat to the Yellow River Basin this year.” Wang Annan, executive deputy commander-in-chief of the Yellow River flood control and Drought Relief Headquarters, said. The prediction and analysis data show that there is more precipitation in the Yellow River Basin this summer. Among them, the precipitation in the north of Hetao is close to the whole year, the precipitation in the South and lower reaches of the middle reaches is 20-40% more, and that in other areas is less than 20%. It is reported that most of the areas with excessive rainfall forecast are the main source areas of flood and sediment caused by the Yellow River. Once a large flood is formed, both water and sediment will fall, making it very difficult to defend. In addition, with the increasing impact of global climate change in recent years and the further increase of flood disaster risk in the Yellow River Basin, the flood control situation of the Yellow River this year is still grim.\n\nThere are multiple short boards in flood control\n\nMa Jianhua said: “at present, the flood control and disaster reduction capacity of the Yangtze River Basin has been significantly improved, but the weak links are still prominent. It will take a long time to improve the flood control and disaster reduction system.”\n\nThe shortage of manpower and great financial pressure have been the short board of flood control in various places for many years. Huarong County, Yueyang City, Hunan Province, is known as “standing on the Yangtze River and stepping on the Dongting”. The first-line flood control dike is 325km long, accounting for about 10% of the total length of the first-line flood control dike in Hunan Province. Wang Zhong, deputy director of Huarong County Water Conservancy Bureau, introduced that Dongting Lake area is the main agricultural production area. A large number of young and strong labor force go out to work, and the left behind personnel are difficult to bear the heavy flood control work. Cadres in Henan, Hubei and other places also reported that the shortage of flood control manpower means that investment should be increased. At the same time, some water conservancy facilities also need to be improved, and local financial pressure is also great.\n\nThe 2022 Yellow River flood control and drought relief work conference revealed that there are many weak links in the flood control engineering system of the Yellow River Basin. Including the low embankment standard of some sections of the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the flood control project in the middle reaches has not yet formed a system, and the downstream “secondary suspended river” channel shape, wandering channel and “moving bed” situation exacerbate the flood risk. “The river conditions in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, with high hanging rivers, wide beaches and many people, and the coexistence of flood and sediment, have not changed, and the situation is still grim,” Wang Annan said\n\nUrban flood control also faces multiple weaknesses. Yuan Zhenlong, director of the Institute of comprehensive management of the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, said that many old urban areas lack the overall planning of flood control functions in the early stage of construction, or the planning is not scientific and accurate enough, the building density in the central urban area is high, and the flood control standards of bungalow areas and old residential areas are low, which makes these areas easy to become weak links of urban flood control. “In some areas, rivers, wetlands and depressions have been occupied, and the urban water storage space is narrow, which can not give full play to the water storage function when the rainstorm comes.” Yuan Zhenlong said.\n\nStrong ability, build team and make up for weaknesses\n\nRecently, in some concave bridge areas in Beijing, the staff of Beijing Drainage Group are installing surveillance cameras to monitor the ponding in the bridge area in real time during the flood season, so as to find the ponding in time and dispose it quickly.\n\nBeijing Drainage Group has increased the total pumping capacity of 88 rainwater pump stations of the group to 750000 cubic meters per hour since 2013. “Last year, we further improved emergency rescue equipment, with a total emergency rescue capacity of 205000 cubic meters per hour, an increase of 17 times compared with 2011.” Beijing Drainage Group official said.\n\nIn rural areas, all localities try their best to make up for the shortcomings of flood control and emergency response capacity by strengthening real-time monitoring, information construction and establishing professional teams. Huarong County investigated the rural young and middle-aged labor force at home before the flood season, organized 17453 assault and patrol personnel and registered them, and established a 100 person county-level flood control emergency rescue militia company and an 80 person County rescue emergency engineering team. “Putting the work ahead avoids the difficulty of organizing temporary personnel.” Wang Zhong told reporters.\n\n“The accumulated rainfall of Xuanmiaoguan reservoir has exceeded 100 mm. We must increase patrols and pay attention to prevent mountain torrents and landslides.” Recently, with the continuous rainfall, Chen Jiangling, a government worker in Leizu Town, Yuan’an County, Yichang City, Hubei Province, received a number of messages on her mobile phone.\n\nThe situation of rainwater in mountainous areas is relatively complex, and people live scattered. According to chenjiangling, a monitoring cloud platform has been established locally, so that the rain information can be monitored in real time, and can be seen at a glance on the platform. Then, the disaster early warning information can be timely released to flood control personnel and people in flood threatened areas through various media such as mobile phone short message platform, wechat official account and video number.\n\n“For the 63 hidden geological hazards identified, we not only put forward preventive and rectification measures, but also establish an on-site inspection mechanism. In case of flood, village cadres and emergency team members will be required to dispatch quickly for emergency disposal to ensure that the hidden risks are controlled and build a safety screen for the people.” Chen Jiangling said.

Ziwei celebrates after the game on July 2. On February 7, Ren Ziwei won the men’s 1000m short track speed skating final of this winter Olympic Games and became the first “double gold” winner of the Chinese ice and snow corps at this winter Olympic Games. “The students I took have won various awards, but I have a dream that has not come true. That is, no child has won the Olympic champion yet.” Two years ago, Wang Beiming, Ren Ziwei’s Enlightenment coach, expressed this regret in a conversation with Ren Ziwei. At that time, Ren Ziwei said with determination that he was confident to help the teacher realize this dream. In 2010, Ren Ziwei suffered an accidental fracture during the competition. At that time, Ren Ziwei’s mother didn’t want him to continue training, so Wang Beiming personally communicated with his parents. Later, Wang Beiming went to work for Ren Ziwei and asked him if he liked the sport and whether he wanted to continue practicing. He replied that he still wanted to, but his parents disagreed. “Miss Wang, do you think I’m ok?” Ren Ziwei was very confused at that time. Wang Beiming replied, “if you say you can, I’ll say you can. If you say you can’t, I’ll say you can’t.” Ren Ziwei said he would do it. Wang Beiming led Ren Ziwei to train for 10 years and witnessed Ren Ziwei grow from a child to the provincial team and national team, and then to win two gold medals in the Beijing Winter Olympics. Ren Ziwei is still expected to win the gold medal in the next two events of the men’s 500 meter relay and the men’s 5000 meter relay in the Winter Olympics.", "timestamp": 1653242497, "digest": "0J84WDUaqTDQdxrjeobNOzYhzDq5NEEA7e1yyGiUlMU", "contributor": "0x4fd71871D9FA215D255E2297B5aB0C8e756e7Dc7"}

If you're not happy with something, change it. Everything is in our minds; if you can change your mind, you will be able to change your reality.\n\nDo not accept things for the sake of it. Question why things should be that way and how you could make them different. At the end of the day, the only thing that matters is you. If I were you, I would make myself the number one priority.\n\nYour happiness is yours. Luckily being happy, you can make others happy. If life is a game, we should have fun playing it. If we decide to suffer, let it be for something worth it.\n\nWhy wait so long to do something you want to do? How many people have ended up doing nothing? Nothing in life is permanent. The only thing that will be permanent for the course of your life is you. So fall in love with yourself since it's the only permanent thing.\n\nPeople come and go, thoughts and emotions come and go, and nothing stays put. The only thing that comes and goes is time. Time passes but never returns. Every second that passes is one second closer to death. Make your time the most important asset you have. Learn to spend it. There is nothing more valuable than time.\n\nLove with all your being, do not shy away from loving. Loving is our nature. No one should prevent you from living. Learn to love; if I were you, I would start with myself. Loving yourself is the most extraordinary act of love you will do in your life. The moment you learn to love yourself, you will be reborn.\n\nLife is simple; our human mind complicates it. We spend so much time wanting things, aching for those things, and so little time appreciating what we already have. Be thankful for everything you have, and being alive is more than enough to feel grateful.\n\nThis message is for whoever, wherever, and whenever.

We all have different ways of feeling loved and wanted.\n\nRest assured that life will be whatever you want it to be. Figure out what you want your life to be.

The language system features a complex of 3D animation, typographic design, abstracted linguistics, Rorschach style inkblots, and procedural monochromatic animations.\n\nThe exhibition’s visual language was the result of over a year's worth of research and development.\n\n> “The approach we took with BAB was essentially linguistic and architectural, having an evocative language as the center of the system made it easy to sculpt around the pieces.” - Moustafa Hassan\n\nThe second output of the project’s research was utilizing B.A.B’s language system in the creation of an interactive care plan designed by web3 smart company m3ga.\n\n> “We wanted to reexamine how a research study engages with black audiences. Typically most studies are uninformed, cultural discordant and just straight boring. Therefore we wanted to tap into mimetics as a pathway to really connect with people using a shared language.” - Gregory Ketant\n\nDeveloped using the [VideoAsk](https://m3ga.world/) platform, the interactive care plan featured response choices such as conditional logic, multiple response options, & contact forms to make the conversation and community building seamless. The diversity in response types allowed the project to think more interpersonally when developing the prompts for the survey.\n\nThe interactive care plan aims to gather the measurable effects of systematic race-related trauma that black artists experience.

Therefore we have decided to leverage the power of web3 to metastasize the exhibition into a DAO; **ghost**DAO.\n\nThe structure of **ghost**DAO is inspired by the utility found in temporary or transitional architecture. Temporary architecture provides a framework for research and experimentation, allowing architects to present their visions on an international stage, with the aim of advancing practice and stimulating innovation.\n\n> Temporary architecture is a fertile ground for testing ideas, examining places, and popularizing new concepts and technologies.\n\nThis architectural framework serves as the conceptual basis for **ghost**DAO; a DAO purposely built for experimentation, examining new practices, and processes for identifying burnout for black artists as well as introducing new concepts in mental health advocacy, innovative treatment & more activities.\n\nOnce our stated goals are met, the **ghost**DAO will dissolve leaving behind all of the research, development, data, and documentation available to the artist community, on-chain.

{"id": "7DflQJiwi4Qojf0NfxtGeFDzY0iGM49UdicXcwqRqeE", "title": "How we found our Teddy :)", "body": "Last summer Sam FaceTime'd me & was talking to me about NFT’s. I knew what NFT’s were before we had that conversation but just never paid attention to it. He said : bro this space is perfect for you, don’t ask me why just go on twitter & join any NFT twitter space and you’ll find your journey, I am so excited to see where this story goes from here…\n\nI still remember saying : bro it’s 4 in the morning rn on a Saturday night and you’re telling me to go on twitter space rn and follow some monkey’s??? lol\n\nIn my mind I was like this dude’s lit & out of his right frame of mind. Finishing our sentences he said Teddy trust me, I know you and I am telling you this is a one way ticket to the life you have always dreamed but never lived and opportunities like this are very hard to find. I just laughed at it and I was like I’ll think about it and let you know…\n\nThen after a week I was playing soccer with Shadow in my backyard thinking about what Sam said the other day and the way he said it it was full of light. I could literally feel those good vibes. Btw Sam is a well known artist in the space, and now after spending all this time in this space I get it why he was hyper that day. Anyways, then I went on my twitter and switched my profile form private to public. I joined my first twitter space, It was with @NFTPrince & NFTsquirrels. Both are living legends and I respect them a lot. They shared tons of selfless advice to me on first day without even knowing who I was, what my real name is, or how I looked like. The knowledge was so valuable that basically I’ve never been rugged / scammed in this space till date. \n\nAfter spending some time in different spaces and observing how everything is working in this ecosystem, I focused on the fundamentals, the way people interact and react with certain things, what values they carried, and how do they find their feeling of importance. It was’nt very difficult for me to figure these things out because of my knowledge & experience with Social Media for over 5 years. I grew 36 million+ followers on Instagram via different entertainment pages and a network of over 250 million+ followers via networking in less than 6 months with just 2,000$ to start with from my college dorm.\n\nDuring that time Bored Ape’s were just flying and they still are but the vibes were immaculate last year you can’t deny that. I literally did a PHD on them and I was just astounded by their story but I was able to relate a lot of it to my life, it was so inspiring and fascinating. I was thinking so much about it, that even in my dreams I was seeing NFT’s all around me and my life changed the night of September 30 when i had that one lucid dream, I decided to do a project to share my story so that others can relate to it and be a part of it. \n\n( Note : This was’nt the main reason for me to do a NFT project. My main goal was and is still the same today that I want to leave this NFT space better than how I found it. )\n\nBack to the story, why Teddy? Well obviously. My friend’s call me Teddy and Teddies have been a part of everyone’s childhood and I believe people will hold on to that tradition forever. They provide us the comfort & companionship, a friend to talk to, and it’s not just kids who benefit from the positive effects of a comforting Teddy squeeze. Teddies are just universal and timeless.\n\nI put all of my traits and character and imagination’s in the art, from my expressions to the way I dress. Some of the assets are added for the aesthetics of the collection. I am not an artist but since I was the character I worked with few freelance artist’s to bring my idea on paper. They asked me for a sketch to give an idea of what I wanted and this is what I sent them lmao 😂😂😂😂😂😂\n\n![ That Yu-Gi-Oh and LV belt part has my heart lmaoooo😭😭😭. Tbh this image is still a lot better than my first one. Btw I am not rich lol, I don't have a AP watch or fancy items.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p7SJwXfpBXm-_G9fiTlu0.jpg?height=1280&width=960)\n\n![This looks decent lol. Lot better than what I came up with.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vxl5Z9dogU0G7wxHt-euI.png?height=1280&width=720)\n\n![That's me on the Left! Dw I am doxed to all our past holder's and lot of people in NFT space know me irl. My identity is just not public in the space atm. I'll reveal it when time is right.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CL1JyGEQS_ynX1v0M1WGn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nBack to the story, so once I got this I reached out to few professional artist’s in my network and I worked with multiple of them to find the perfect Teddy. We wanted to stick with 2D because 3D art is great but the market seemed to be doing well with 2D more than 3D collections. Ofcs art style isn’t the main reason for it but it does play a role. But then I am like let’s take the challenge and create something insane. During the time when I started the project, their were’nt any 3D project’s coming out just yet nor there were any noticeable Teddy Bear collections popping as long as I know. So then we decided to turn this into 3D. During this process one 3D artist reached out to me in my DM’s of one our meme page asking to collab, I am like okay cool lets give it a shot and see what you got. \n\n![This is what he came up with as base model. 💀💀💀](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FcshCcWqBzufElk9puKnW.png?height=772&width=778)\n\nYeah he just lost me on that base model. If ur surprised, I did’nt see this coming either, when I saw it for the first time I was out of words just like you are rn. I seriously had no comments on this image. So yeah I had to say no to that dude and look for another artist. The fact that people fake their LinkedIn and show you proof of work of other artist is just hilarious. So I asked one of my friend on telegram if he knew any artist to connect me and he did. \n\n![Idk tbh, it was just not it.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z3yiJzSTaGmqQdaHZroTJ.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nIt just did’nt feel right going with the full body at this point, gave pfp style a shot and see how it does. Initially the idea was, we will do pfp collection and in a seperate contract and we will give the holders full body version of their Teddy so they have both and can use it the way they like whether to animate or so with the source file…\n\n![I finally said yes to this one and made a deal with the artist and gave her an upfront amount for her time that we both agreed on. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ef-d0SnN5nrZH4EpHIfbn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThe decided to upfront because she told me she had financial instability and urgently need of money for rent and expenses so she would’nt be able to work full time on this project and it would take lot longer to complete the collection than what I was expecting. Plus I genuinely wanted to help her regardless of if she would work for the project or not due to her situation. \n\n![My mind, Her ability.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q7q8YdENYDP5zDlajLh05.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nWe decided to fully render and rigg the collection in the end after all the traits and assets are illustrated and confirmed so that their isn't any confusions and nothing is left out. But unfortunately when she submitted, the quality of collection turned out terrible atleast from my pov. I communicated it with our community and told them that ‘guys we do not have the collection fully rigged and its in between 2D and 3D so we would have to pause the project for now until we find another artist and see how things go from there’. \n\nBut then I was also out of funds because I put everything I had in the project initially. So I communicated this with the community in our discord and 34 people ended up minting 100 regardless of the situation. 10 were minted for team and 1 was minted by me personally to participate in the process just like any other member of community. They knew that mint had zero value and won’t have a secondary market value but yet they still supported. So that moment onwards my belief in the project became even stronger and quitting was never an option no matter what situation I go through. The collection won’t ever be revealed because I don’t believe in trying to sell some bullshit to people just to pocket some eth. In trying to sell NFT’s I am not going to sell my character, tf I look like? ZagaBond? There is a big fat difference between failing and abandoning your project. We don’t give up around here…This project is my dream and it like a child to me. I want to be the best out there in anything I do in life. Whether if it is playing soccer or anything that I hold dear too I give my absolute best to win. When I play soccer I don’t play to just participate I play to make difference, I play to dominate the field. \n\n[https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub](https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub)\n\nSo yeah that was my first failure in NFT space, I learned a lot from that failure. The most important thing was that when starting a business do everything you can to gather great people that have the same drive & BELIEVE IN YOUR VISION as you do. Because in the end all a business is a group of people dedicated to provide service or product to people. Take care of your team like your family & they’ll take care of your business & customers. \n\nThen after I did an outreach again and managed to find a team of 4 professional 3D artist’s. Their past ventures have involved working with brands like Puma, Bangs and Lulu Lemon. Their Identities are anon as they wish to keep it that way but I have confirmed the veracity of their credentials. When I presented this entire idea and vision of the collection to them, after hearing me they instantly said yes and told be that we believe in you and we’re gonna make the best collection of 2022. We started working on it the same day and even with this team, I worked 1 on 1 with the team over screen shares for every single trait’s and asset’s and outcomes are just fantastic. Look It does’nt matter what people think of it but we do believe it is one of the greatest NFT collections that will ever be deployed on Blockchain. We’ve put our blood, sweat and tears in this collection as a team day in and day out. The collection is timeless & it will age well I can make that one promise for sure. \n\n![This collection is dedicated to someone who does'nt need to own it. It's a dream come true. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wKl-h3xgt9G73xjvxW_7_.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThere is no bigger feeling than making your dream come true and the story will never have an end to be honest. I am just the captain of the boat as of now but at some point I want to hand the dream over to the community in a position that even if I am not present the story live forever as long as their is imagination left in this world. \n\nBig hug & Thank you for your time and consideration for reading this. I genuinely appreciate your presence here with all my heart.

Rather then fetishize black trauma, we utilized art as a device to create sustainable resistance measures to envisage better experiences for black artists.\n\n![3D Avatar: Khalid](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i2wksw2q9s53364/We%20Got%20You.gif?raw=1)\n\n## The Mission\n\nThe project’s fundamental objective is to raise awareness of the deleterious effects of burnout as it specifically relates to black artists. B.A.B provides visibility for an under-diagnosed issue and representation to better the landscape for those who deal with race-related trauma in the artist ecosystem.\n\n> B.A.B was commissioned by contemporary digital art and technology archive Rhizome, and co-presented with The New Museum.\n\n![3D Avatar: Kiyana](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bl1n6eoowrkzb7k/RHZ%20Transition.gif?raw=1)\n\nExamples of symptoms of burn-out for black artists:\n\n* Persistent penalization for speaking out against racist institutions leading to self-initiated deletion of social accounts\n* Emotional, mental, and psychological distress leading to prolonged hiatus, inconsistent engagement, and detachment from the artist community\n* Lack of interest to remain present due to low incentive; meaning lessened ability to maintain a quality standard of living from which most of one's time is invested\n\n> Burnout is categorized as a \"syndrome\" that results from \"chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed.” ([WHO International Disease Classification CD-11](https://www.who.int/news/item/28-05-2019-burn-out-an-occupational-phenomenon-international-classification-of-diseases)).\n\n## Folk • Tech: Interactive Care Plan\n\n![Left to Right: Lizz, Nuenoto, Max](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c76ru71k9k5z3tu/Cereal%20Box.gif?raw=1)\n\nA critical innovation in B.A.B’s development is the exhibition’s visual language. The language system features a complex of 3D animation, typographic design, abstracted linguistics, Rorschach style inkblots, and procedural monochromatic animations.\n\nThe exhibition’s visual language was the result of over a year's worth of research and development.\n\n> “The approach we took with BAB was essentially linguistic and architectural, having an evocative language as the center of the system made it easy to sculpt around the pieces.” - Moustafa Hassan\n\nThe second output of the project’s research was utilizing B.A.B’s language system in the creation of an interactive care plan designed by web3 smart company m3ga.\n\n> “We wanted to reexamine how a research study engages with black audiences. Typically most studies are uninformed, cultural discordant and just straight boring. Therefore we wanted to tap into mimetics as a pathway to really connect with people using a shared language.” - Gregory Ketant\n\nDeveloped using the [VideoAsk](https://m3ga.world/) platform, the interactive care plan featured response choices such as conditional logic, multiple response options, & contact forms to make the conversation and community building seamless. The diversity in response types allowed the project to think more interpersonally when developing the prompts for the survey.\n\nThe interactive care plan aims to gather the measurable effects of systematic race-related trauma that black artists experience. The goal is to see how the interpretation of the information provided can guide a larger community towards finding solutions around inequity and harm reduction that produce observable results.\n\n![  “When we suffer in silence conditions for chronic stress are created. If left unaddressed and unresolved burnout occurs.”](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k7dbvi0lfxtsd72/Ink%20Transition.gif?raw=1)\n\n## Early Look at the Data\n\n[PSA 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC0xlB6KwD0)\n\nTo date, the interactive care plan has reached over 300+ impressions and generated over 100 conversations spanning 3 continents, 5 countries, and over a dozen cities.\n\nA snapshot of early statistics gathered from the study:\n\n* 63% of the respondents identify as black\n* 7% of the respondents identify as indigenous\n* 31% of the respondents identify as non-black / non-indigenous\n* 20% of respondents have completed the study\n* 34% of respondents have completed half of the study’s questions/prompts\n\nWe are currently coordinating outreach to connect respondents to provide any needed emotional or logistical support to finish the study.\n\n> **Note**: Anyone is invited to take part in the study however participants who identify as non-black / non-indigenous are considered a part of the control group data cohort.\n\n![Preview from the B.A.B collection that will be up for auction soon.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j5eG6uuKzS4GO07nuvhZv.png?height=3616&width=3616)\n\n![Prototype identity for ghostDAO](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E2A6N4LXv3z-jRNV7KZju.png?height=620&width=2126)\n\nDuring the development of the exhibition, we realized that B.A.B has an opportunity to make a much larger, sustainable impact beyond creating awareness of this underdiagnosed issue. We surmised that if the exhibition is already generating community-led conversations, as well as creating solutions, then B.A.B is already doing the work of an institution. Therefore we have decided to leverage the power of web3 to metastasize the exhibition into a DAO; **ghost**DAO.\n\nThe structure of **ghost**DAO is inspired by the utility found in temporary or transitional architecture. Temporary architecture provides a framework for research and experimentation, allowing architects to present their visions on an international stage, with the aim of advancing practice and stimulating innovation.\n\n> Temporary architecture is a fertile ground for testing ideas, examining places, and popularizing new concepts and technologies.\n\nThis architectural framework serves as the conceptual basis for **ghost**DAO; a DAO purposely built for experimentation, examining new practices, and processes for identifying burnout for black artists as well as introducing new concepts in mental health advocacy, innovative treatment & more activities.\n\nOnce our stated goals are met, the **ghost**DAO will dissolve leaving behind all of the research, development, data, and documentation available to the artist community, on-chain. Our intention by dissolving is to leave the framework for community-led efforts that focus on missions instead of the institutionalization of action.\n\n### Why a DAO?\n\n[Nexus\\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LQPNN9zgYc)\n\nLimitations to resources and barriers to education have presented themselves in a number of ways while producing this exhibition. **ghost**DAO serves as a regenerative streamlining of support to accomplish our communities’ goals as our shared needs make themselves known. These key factors, once properly resolved, will no longer stifle the operations of this project:\n\n* Requiring institutional backing or capital to gain access to educational references and resources from academic journals, databases, and other archives\n* Paying for first-hand accounts or sources related to our research; including people or property\n* Investing in new and pre-existing solutions to the problems that arise in the process of the study, as well as those suggested by our data analysis\n* Production and labor costs\n* Mutual aid efforts\n\n### Vodun (Paris)\n\n[crowdfund://0x7213aA1d22A74c03D5fc07871b33E55Db5a7805a?version=podium_1&network=mainnet](crowdfund://0x7213aA1d22A74c03D5fc07871b33E55Db5a7805a?version=podium_1&network=mainnet)\n\nOur roadmap is a mission-based schematic, colloquially known as a *drill*, based on the completion of milestones at which the DAO is triggered to dissolve. The mission for this version of **ghost**DAO is called *Vodun* (Paris).\n\n**1-800-Comfort Calls Installation**\nComfort Calls is the curation of physical platforms for social exchange rooted in self-healing. In incubation pods, participants are invited to initiate 3 activations that encourage them to occupy their mind, time, and space with concepts around collective wellness.\n\n**B.A.B: Interactive Care Plan: Version 2**\nVersion 1 is live right now and we’re already learning what works and what doesn’t. What is the community responding to? Is it really accessible? What can we do to optimize it? % of funds will be allocated to improving the interactive care plan to make a version 2 that will be accessible to multiple languages with an improved design.\n\n**Artificial Intelligence** **Toolkit**\nIn researching ways to create a smart survey, we wanted to employ an analysis method that decreased the amount of subjectivity when looking at participant responses. Therefore we want to develop artificial intelligence tools that can help us achieve a safe, depersonalized method of analysis.\n\n**B.A.B Journal** After we completed our testing and deployment of B.A.B interactive care plan version 2, we will publish / mint a journal of our findings featuring data analyzed using our custom artificial intelligence toolkit.\n\n**Vodun (Paris)**\nThe final mission is to present our concept for black artist reform in a Moorish-inspired diplomatic correspondence to *TBD* Paris based art institutions. The edict will be the sum total of the research, development, and data collected studying the effects of Black Artist Burnout.\n\nOnce funding goals are raised, **ghost**DAO will actively recruit black and indigenous creatives of all types to join our organization.\n\n### UPDATE:\n\nOn April 11, 2022 **ghost**DAO was interviewed by researcher and professor of art history and theory at the National Superior School of Art of Nancy; [Vanina Gere](https://frenchamerican.org/vanina-gere/).

Our intention by dissolving is to leave the framework for community-led efforts that focus on missions instead of the institutionalization of action.\n\n### Why a DAO?\n\n[Nexus\\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LQPNN9zgYc)\n\nLimitations to resources and barriers to education have presented themselves in a number of ways while producing this exhibition. **ghost**DAO serves as a regenerative streamlining of support to accomplish our communities’ goals as our shared needs make themselves known. These key factors, once properly resolved, will no longer stifle the operations of this project:\n\n* Requiring institutional backing or capital to gain access to educational references and resources from academic journals, databases, and other archives\n* Paying for first-hand accounts or sources related to our research; including people or property\n* Investing in new and pre-existing solutions to the problems that arise in the process of the study, as well as those suggested by our data analysis\n* Production and labor costs\n* Mutual aid efforts\n\n### Vodun (Paris)\n\n[crowdfund://0x7213aA1d22A74c03D5fc07871b33E55Db5a7805a?version=podium_1&network=mainnet](crowdfund://0x7213aA1d22A74c03D5fc07871b33E55Db5a7805a?version=podium_1&network=mainnet)\n\nOur roadmap is a mission-based schematic, colloquially known as a *drill*, based on the completion of milestones at which the DAO is triggered to dissolve. The mission for this version of **ghost**DAO is called *Vodun* (Paris).\n\n**1-800-Comfort Calls Installation**\nComfort Calls is the curation of physical platforms for social exchange rooted in self-healing. In incubation pods, participants are invited to initiate 3 activations that encourage them to occupy their mind, time, and space with concepts around collective wellness.\n\n**B.A.B: Interactive Care Plan: Version 2**\nVersion 1 is live right now and we’re already learning what works and what doesn’t. What is the community responding to? Is it really accessible? What can we do to optimize it? % of funds will be allocated to improving the interactive care plan to make a version 2 that will be accessible to multiple languages with an improved design.\n\n**Artificial Intelligence** **Toolkit**\nIn researching ways to create a smart survey, we wanted to employ an analysis method that decreased the amount of subjectivity when looking at participant responses. Therefore we want to develop artificial intelligence tools that can help us achieve a safe, depersonalized method of analysis.\n\n**B.A.B Journal** After we completed our testing and deployment of B.A.B interactive care plan version 2, we will publish / mint a journal of our findings featuring data analyzed using our custom artificial intelligence toolkit.\n\n**Vodun (Paris)**\nThe final mission is to present our concept for black artist reform in a Moorish-inspired diplomatic correspondence to *TBD* Paris based art institutions. The edict will be the sum total of the research, development, and data collected studying the effects of Black Artist Burnout.\n\nOnce funding goals are raised, **ghost**DAO will actively recruit black and indigenous creatives of all types to join our organization.\n\n### UPDATE:\n\nOn April 11, 2022 **ghost**DAO was interviewed by researcher and professor of art history and theory at the National Superior School of Art of Nancy; [Vanina Gere](https://frenchamerican.org/vanina-gere/).

I knew what NFT’s were before we had that conversation but just never paid attention to it. He said : bro this space is perfect for you, don’t ask me why just go on twitter & join any NFT twitter space and you’ll find your journey, I am so excited to see where this story goes from here…\n\nI still remember saying : bro it’s 4 in the morning rn on a Saturday night and you’re telling me to go on twitter space rn and follow some monkey’s??? lol\n\nIn my mind I was like this dude’s lit & out of his right frame of mind. Finishing our sentences he said Teddy trust me, I know you and I am telling you this is a one way ticket to the life you have always dreamed but never lived and opportunities like this are very hard to find. I just laughed at it and I was like I’ll think about it and let you know…\n\nThen after a week I was playing soccer with Shadow in my backyard thinking about what Sam said the other day and tbh I enjoyed hearing him & everything he had to say with enthusiasm over the potential of NFT’s. Btw Sam is a well known artist in the space, and now after spending all this time in this space I get it why he was hyper that day. Anyways, then I went on my twitter and switched my profile form private to public. I joined my first twitter space, It was with @NFTPrince & NFTsquirrels. Both are living legends and I respect them a lot. They shared tons of selfless advice to me on first day without even knowing who I was, what my real name is, or how I looked like. The knowledge was so valuable that basically I’ve never been rugged / scammed in this space till date. \n\nAfter spending some time in different spaces and observing how everything is working in this ecosystem, I focused on the fundamentals, the way people interact and react with certain things, what values they carried, and how do they find their feeling of importance. It was’nt very difficult for me to figure these things out because of my knowledge & experience with Social Media for over 5 years. I grew 36 million+ followers on Instagram via different entertainment pages and a network of over 250 million+ followers via networking in less than 6 months with just 2,000$ to start with from my college dorm.\n\nDuring that time Bored Ape’s were just flying and they still are but the vibes were immaculate last year you can’t deny that. I literally did a PHD on them and I was just astounded by their story but I was able to relate a lot of it to my life, it was so inspiring and fascinating. I was thinking so much about it, that even in my dreams I was seeing NFT’s all around me and my life changed the night of September 30 with that one lucid dream, I decided to do a project to share my story so that others can relate to it and be a part of it. \n\n( Note : This was’nt the main reason for me to do a NFT project. My main goal was and is still the same today that I want to leave this NFT space better than how I found it. )\n\nBack to the story, why Teddy? Well obviously. My friend’s call me Teddy and Teddies have been a part of everyone’s childhood and I believe people will hold on to that tradition forever. They provide us the comfort & companionship, a friend to talk to, and it’s not just kids who benefit from the positive effects of a comforting Teddy squeeze. Teddies are just universal and timeless.\n\nI put all of my traits and character and imagination’s in the art, from my expressions to the way I dress. Some of the assets are added for the aesthetics of the collection. I am not an artist but since I was the character I worked with few freelance artist’s to bring my idea on paper. They asked me for a sketch to give an idea of what I wanted and this is what I sent them lmao 😂😂😂😂😂😂\n\n![ That Yu-Gi-Oh and LV belt part has my heart lmaoooo😭😭😭. Tbh this image is still a lot better than my first one. Btw I am not rich lol, I don't have a AP watch or fancy items.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p7SJwXfpBXm-_G9fiTlu0.jpg?height=1280&width=960)\n\n![This looks decent lol. Lot better than what I came up with.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vxl5Z9dogU0G7wxHt-euI.png?height=1280&width=720)\n\n![That's me on the Left! Dw I am doxed to all our past holder's and lot of people in NFT space know me irl. My identity is just not public in the space atm. I'll reveal it when time is right.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CL1JyGEQS_ynX1v0M1WGn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nBack to the story, so once I got this I reached out to few professional artist’s in my network and I worked with multiple of them to find the perfect Teddy. We wanted to stick with 2D because 3D art is great but the market seemed to be doing well with 2D more than 3D collections. Ofcs art style isn’t the main reason for it but it does play a role. But then I am like let’s take the challenge and create something insane. During the time when I started the project, their were’nt any 3D project’s coming out just yet nor there were any noticeable Teddy Bear collections popping as long as I know. So then we decided to turn this into 3D. During this process one 3D artist reached out to me in my DM’s of one our meme page asking to collab, I am like okay cool lets give it a shot and see what you got. \n\n![This is what he came up with as base model. 💀💀💀](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FcshCcWqBzufElk9puKnW.png?height=772&width=778)\n\nYeah he just lost me on that base model. If ur surprised, I did’nt see this coming either, when I saw it for the first time I was out of words just like you are rn. I seriously had no comments on this image. So yeah I had to say no to that dude and look for another artist. The fact that people fake their LinkedIn and show you proof of work of other artist is just hilarious. So I asked one of my friend on telegram if he knew any artist to connect me and he did. \n\n![Idk tbh, it was just not it.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z3yiJzSTaGmqQdaHZroTJ.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nIt just did’nt feel right going with the full body at this point, gave pfp style a shot and see how it does. Initially the idea was, we will do pfp collection and in a seperate contract and we will give the holders full body version of their Teddy so they have both and can use it the way they like whether to animate or so with the source file…\n\n![I finally said yes to this one and made a deal with the artist and gave her an upfront amount for her time that we both agreed on. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ef-d0SnN5nrZH4EpHIfbn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThe decided to upfront because she told me she had financial instability and urgently need of money for rent and expenses so she would’nt be able to work full time on this project and it would take lot longer to complete the collection than what I was expecting. Plus I genuinely wanted to help her regardless of if she would work for the project or not due to her situation. \n\n![My mind, Her ability.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q7q8YdENYDP5zDlajLh05.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nWe decided to fully render and rigg the collection in the end after all the traits and assets are illustrated and confirmed so that their isn't any confusions and nothing is left out. But unfortunately when she submitted, the quality of collection turned out terrible atleast from my pov. I communicated it with our community and told them that ‘guys we do not have the collection fully rigged and its in between 2D and 3D so we would have to pause the project for now until we find another artist and see how things go from there’. \n\nBut then I was also out of funds because I put everything I had in the project initially. So I communicated this with the community in our discord and 34 people ended up minting 100 regardless of the situation. 10 were minted for team and 1 was minted by me personally to participate in the process just like any other member of community. They knew that mint had zero value and won’t have a secondary market value but yet they still supported. So that moment onwards my belief in the project became even stronger and quitting was never an option no matter what situation I go through. The collection won’t ever be revealed because I don’t believe in trying to sell some bullshit to people just to pocket some eth. In trying to sell NFT’s I am not going to sell my character, tf I look like? ZagaBond? There is a big fat difference between failing and abandoning your project. We don’t give up around here…This project is my dream and it like a child to me. I want to be the best out there in anything I do in life. Whether if it is playing soccer or anything that I hold dear too I give my absolute best to win. When I play soccer I don’t play to just participate I play to make difference, I play to dominate the field. \n\n[https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub](https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub)\n\nSo yeah that was my first failure in NFT space, I learned a lot from that failure. The most important thing was that when starting a business do everything you can to gather great people that have the same drive & BELIEVE IN YOUR VISION as you do. Because in the end all a business is a group of people dedicated to provide service or product to people. Take care of your team like your family & they’ll take care of your business & customers. \n\nThen after I did an outreach again and managed to find a team of 4 professional 3D artist’s. Their past ventures have involved working with brands like Puma, Bangs and Lulu Lemon. Their Identities are anon as they wish to keep it that way but I have confirmed the veracity of their credentials. When I presented this entire idea and vision of the collection to them, after hearing me they instantly said yes and told be that we believe in you and we’re gonna make the best collection of 2022. We started working on it the same day and even with this team, I worked 1 on 1 with the team over screen shares for every single trait’s and asset’s and outcomes are just fantastic. Look It does’nt matter what people think of it but we do believe it is one of the greatest NFT collections that will ever be deployed on Blockchain. We’ve put our blood, sweat and tears in this collection as a team day in and day out. The collection is timeless & it will age well I can make that one promise for sure. \n\n![This collection is dedicated to someone who does'nt need to own it. It's a dream come true. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wKl-h3xgt9G73xjvxW_7_.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThere is no bigger feeling than making your dream come true and the story will never have an end to be honest. I am just the captain of the boat as of now but at some point I want to hand the dream over to the community in a position that even if I am not present the story live forever as long as their is imagination left in this world. \n\nBig hug & Thank you for your time and consideration for reading this. I genuinely appreciate your presence here with all my heart.

The system removes the control banks and institutions have on money, financial products, and financial services.\n\nSome of the key attractions of DeFi for many consumers are:\n\n* It eliminates the fees that banks and other financial companies charge for using their services.\n* You hold your money in a secure digital wallet instead of keeping it in a bank.\n* Anyone with an internet connection can use it without needing approval.\n* You can transfer funds in seconds and minutes.\n\n  ### Decentralized Finance\n\n  Decentralized finance eliminates intermediaries by allowing people, merchants, and businesses to conduct financial transactions through emerging technology. This is accomplished through peer-to-peer financial networks that use security protocols, connectivity, software, and hardware advancements.\n\n  From anywhere you have an internet connection, you can lend, trade, and borrow using software that records and verifies financial actions in distributed financial databases. A distributed database is accessible across various locations; it collects and aggregates data from all users and uses a consensus mechanism to verify it.\n\n  Decentralized finance uses this technology to eliminate centralized finance models by enabling anyone to use financial services anywhere regardless of who or where they are.\n\n  DeFi applications give users more control over their money through personal wallets and trading services that cater to individuals.", "timestamp": 1653245371, "digest": "dMPO6CJ-fZtOv13vssskl_cfPKwGA07KdSgawA8n0VQ", "contributor": "0x2169Ec73eeB5287Ed3180b401B6383BEaf5a2011"}

{"id": "Pqqol7jeEi583r4UcDCDnqAizyby41Nf8hYr7m8rdqw", "title": "In April, the production and sales of automobile enterprises were cut by half, and new energy became popular against the market", "body": "Recently, the passenger Federation released the latest passenger car sales in April. According to the data, in April 2022, the retail sales volume of the domestic narrow passenger car market reached 1043000, with a year-on-year decrease of 35.5% and a month on month decrease of 34.0%. The year-on-year and month on month growth rate of retail in April were at the lowest in the history of that month. From January to April, a total of 5.958 million vehicles were retailed, a year-on-year decrease of 11.9%.\n\nIn this regard, the China Railway Passenger Transport Federation pointed out that due to the impact of the epidemic, there is a shortage of imported parts, domestic parts system suppliers involved in the Yangtze River Delta are unable to supply in time, and some even completely shut down or shut down. In addition, the logistics efficiency is reduced and the transportation time is uncontrollable, resulting in the prominent problem of poor production.\n\nIn addition, in April, the production of five major auto enterprises in Shanghai decreased by 75% month on month compared with March, the production of joint venture major auto enterprises in Changchun decreased by 54%, and the overall decline in other regions was 38%. The national radiation effect of the parts system in Shanghai was prominent. It can be seen that the impact of the epidemic on the automotive industry is still great.\n\nAuto Enterprises: SAIC’s sales are greatly affected\n\nDue to the impact of the epidemic, the sales ranking of automobile enterprises changed greatly in April. The champion of FAW Volkswagen was taken away by BYD, and the sales volume of SAIC (including SAIC Volkswagen, SAIC GM and SAIC GM Wuling) fell collectively. In particular, SAIC GM Wuling has fallen out of the top ten list.\n\nAlthough the sales volume of independent brands is passable, Geely and Chang’an are on the list one after another, but the sales volume data is not good-looking, and great wall motor also ranks outside the top 10; It is noteworthy that the overall performance of the Japanese system is fairly good, with GAC Toyota in the third place and Dongfeng Nissan in the second place.\n\nBYD, which ranked first, had a brilliant sales performance in April, reaching 105000 vehicles. It was also the only auto enterprise with a sales volume of more than 100000 vehicles in April, with a year-on-year increase of 138.4% and a market share of 10%. It has to be said that BYD’s achievements with new energy vehicles are worth learning from many car enterprises. In particular, the model equipped with DM-I super hybrid system launched by BYD is very popular and the product is excellent enough.\n\nThe sales volume of Geely Automobile and Chang’an Automobile, both independent brands, also declined to varying degrees in April. Among them, Geely Automobile sold 54600 vehicles in April, with a year-on-year decrease of 40.4% and a market share of 5.2%, ranking fifth; Chang’an Automobile followed, with a sales volume of 53700, with a market share of 5.2%, ranking sixth.\n\nUnfortunately, Great Wall Motors has been squeezed out of the top ten list in April. According to the official data released by Great Wall Motors, the Haval brand sold 29125 vehicles in April; Euler brand sells 3088 vehicles; Wei brand sells 2293 vehicles; The tank brand sells 6065 vehicles.\n\nAccording to our rough calculation, the sales volume of the passenger car sector of Great Wall Motor in April was only more than 40000, and the data of the passenger Federation was 35600. In this regard, Great Wall attributed the problem to the domestic epidemic, supply chain, logistics and other impacts, but this is also a common problem faced by all auto enterprises. However, the decline of great wall motor is obvious, which shows that great wall motor is still under great pressure.\n\nNext, let’s look at the sales performance of the joint venture brand in April. FAW Volkswagen sold 81000 vehicles in April, down 49.2% year-on-year, losing the championship, which is not a small gap with BYD’s sales of 105000 vehicles; The same brother SAIC Volkswagen was even worse, with sales of only 52000 vehicles, down 52.4% year-on-year, falling to the eighth place, mainly due to the impact of the epidemic and the shortage of parts.\n\nSAIC General Motors of SAIC system sold only 50000 vehicles in April, a year-on-year decline of 57% and a market share of 4.8%, ranking ninth. Similarly, as the main sales source of SAIC Group, SAIC GM has made some miserable achievements. At the same time, SAIC GM Wuling was also squeezed out of the top 10. The impact of the epidemic in Shanghai on SAIC Group is indeed not small.\n\nThe performance of Sino Japanese brands of joint venture car enterprises is fairly reasonable. GAC Toyota ranked third, with sales of 64000 vehicles in April, down 7.3% year-on-year. GAC Toyota is the enterprise with the lowest sales decline among the top ten car enterprises. Compared with Japanese Dongfeng Nissan, Dongfeng Honda and GAC Honda, the decline is not obvious.\n\nDongfeng Nissan ranked fourth, with sales of 58000 vehicles in April, a year-on-year decline of 43.4% and a market share of 5.5%. Dongfeng Nissan’s sales volume is good, or Xuanyi’s car is the biggest credit. If the reason for the decline in sales volume is not only the cause of the epidemic, but also the defect in the product power of xinxinjun, which leads to the obvious decline in sales volume.\n\nAmong the Japanese series, the sales volume of Honda series is average. The sales volume of Dongfeng Honda in April was 52000 vehicles, down 38.4% year-on-year, with a market share of 5%; GAC Honda sold 43000 vehicles, a year-on-year decline of 33.2% and a market share of 4.1%. The year-on-year decline of the two car companies exceeded 30%, and the sales performance was very general.\n\nBecause of the epidemic, many auto enterprises suffered serious losses, especially the shortage of parts led to the shutdown and shutdown of auto enterprises. Although the follow-up factories began to resume production, it was very difficult to catch up in a short time.\n\nSUV: BYD wins Grand Slam\n\nFrom the performance of SUV segment market, the cumulative sales volume in April was 459000, a year-on-year decrease of 38.6% and a month on month decrease of 38.1%; From January to April, the cumulative sales volume was 2.767 million, a year-on-year decrease of 11%.\n\nFrom the ranking of SUV sales in April, the overall characteristics are as follows: the BYD Song family still performed well, won the champion of SUV sales, and the performance of 25105 vehicles far exceeded that of Honda CR-V and Haval H6, which ranked second and third. In addition, BYD’s other SUV models, such as BYD Tang and BYD yuan plus, are all in the top 10 of the list;\n\nHaval H6 still failed to turn over this time, ranking third, suppressed by BYD Song family and Honda CR-V; In the high-end luxury SUV market, Mercedes Benz GLC and BMW X3 have entered the list, and Audi Q5 has disappeared; Because of the impact of the epidemic, Tesla Model y disappeared from the list. Next, we briefly analyze the market performance of each SUV model.\n\nIn the first place is the BYD Song family. The sales volume in April was 25105, with a year-on-year increase of 60.2%.

What contribution has it made to realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation? What valuable historical experience do you have? What should the Communist Youth League do in the new era?  \n\nNi Bangwen, Secretary of the Party committee of the Central Youth League school (China Youth Political College), said: “the important speech of the general secretary is highly political, ideological and strategic. It comprehensively and systematically reviews the history of the Communist Youth League in the past 100 years and points out the direction for the party’s youth work in the new era.”\n\nThe fate of youth has always been closely linked with the times. More than 100 years ago, when the nation was in danger, a group of young people who first awakened held high the banner of Marxism and lit the revolutionary fire in the dark night. In 1921, a group of young people with an average age of 28 established the Communist Party of China. Once the Communist Party of China was born, it paid attention to the youth and placed the hope of revolution on the youth. On May 5, 1922, under the direct care and leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Communist Youth League of China was established. Since then, the Chinese youth movement has opened a new chapter in history.\n\nWhat the party flag refers to is what the regiment flag refers to. From the day of its birth, the Communist Youth League has always been unswervingly following the party. In the course of a hundred years of struggle, the Communist Youth League has united the majority of Chinese youth, listened to the party’s command and fought with the party, and has made positive contributions and played an important role in various historical periods.\n\nOver the past 100 years, generation after generation of League members and young people have advanced one after another for the country and the nation. In the journey of striving for national independence, they rushed to the front and shed their blood; In the vast world of new China, they worked selflessly and worked hard; They are at the forefront of reform, opening up and modernization\n\nDean of the Youth Development Institute of the University of international business and economics Lian Si, an expert member of the national medium and long term youth development plan, said: “If we look at the history of this league, I think it is a song of youth played by the youth love party and the party love youth polyphony. On the one hand, the youth love the party, and the majority of young people sincerely follow the party to build a new China in the decadent world, in which the Communist Youth League has also played the value of the times of organizing and mobilizing young people; on the other hand, the party loves young people, and the party spared no effort to build a stage and create a platform for young people What role can we see the Communist Youth League play? It is an important mission to convey the voice of the party, gather the opinions of young people and ensure the development of young people. “\n\n \n\n  To guide the formulation of the first youth development plan and the first white paper specially issued for youth groups in the history of new China; Put forward a series of new ideas, viewpoints and conclusions around youth work to promote all-round progress and historic achievements in China’s youth development.\n\nLi Di, deputy director of the Youth Rights and interests Department of the Communist Youth League Central Committee, said: “while promoting and leading the party’s youth work, the general secretary also answered a series of major strategic topics such as what kind of youth to cultivate in the new era, how to cultivate youth, what kind of Communist Youth League to build and how to build the Communist Youth League, which provides fundamental guidance and guidance for the work of the Communist Youth League and the party’s youth work.”\n\nWhat are the Chinese youth like in the new era? We can see that during the outbreak raid, nearly half of the medical staff in Wuhan were “post-90s” and “post-00s”. In the major task of tackling key scientific and technological problems, a large number of young scientific and technological talents have played a leading role: the average age of “Shenzhou team” is 33 years old, and the average age of China Tianyan fast R & D team is only 30 years old\n\nAt the 2022 Winter Olympics, Su Yiming and a large number of athletes worked hard to let people see the best appearance of youth.\n\nOn the battlefield of poverty alleviation, in the process of defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and at every critical moment when the motherland and the people need it, the Communist Youth League has united and led the Youth League members to shoulder the heavy burden entrusted by the state and the nation, and demonstrated their determination and responsibility with practical actions.\n\n \n\nThe long march from generation to generation. Realizing the Chinese dream is a historical relay race. At present, the great changes in the world that have not been seen in a century have accelerated the evolution, and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered a critical period. On the new journey, how to better unite, organize and mobilize young people to strive for the realization of the second Centennial goal and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is a major issue that must be answered by China’s youth movement and youth work in the new era.\n\nLian Si said: “in his speech, the general secretary put forward four hopes for the Communist Youth League. Adhering to educating people for the party is the fundamental task of the Communist Youth League’s work. Conscientious responsibility is actually a duty and mission of the Communist Youth League. Caring for the majority of young people is a driving source of the Communist Youth League’s work. Being brave in self revolution is actually a fundamental guarantee for the Communist Youth League’s continuous self iteration and self-development.”\n\n  for instance,", "timestamp": 1653245573, "digest": "uPi7WPgb4IiR__ScPz5ijQNsX2AwbSBnJm0QzU7p8R4", "contributor": "0x0727CBC189380057FEd7E2ECe1d60099dECa589d"}

{"id": "pmlHLQppScxont1uIa8CBC4P1zWTMZguNiuyQUwiVcs", "title": "Why Owning NFTs Will Be The Future of Your Identity ", "body": "By [Zachary Scott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharyscott01/)\n\nIn the wake of what can only be described as a global NFT craze, I find myself wondering what more there is to the future of NFTs other than digital art…\n\n**Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and more specifically their smart contracts may prove to have a much deeper and more transformative impact than most casual observers would expect. There is a day on the horizon where NFTs will form the basis of our identities and reflect the characteristics of our individual personalities.**\n\nLooking beyond “material” possessions (and not material in the sense of tangible items as we all know that by definition NFTs are not quite this) but material in the sense of valuable digital art of which we have seen many amazing [examples](https://foundation.app/). 2021 was the year that NFTs became mainstream, but the more we learn the more we realise there is still a long way to go in the development of this technology with many real-world [use cases](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763) that will impact our everyday life, on the surface and within.\n\n**It's not about what you own but who you can become**\n\n[Alex Danco](https://alexdanco.com/) does a truly fantastic job at describing this in Packy McCormick’s [Not Boring – Tokengated Commerce](https://www.notboring.co/p/tokengated-commerce?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0NjkxMjA4OSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NTMxNTkyODYsIl8iOiJSSnFQaCIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTUwMTYwMywiZXhwIjoxNjUxNTA1MjAzLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMTAwMjUiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.SUd1yV_bVySDF3oItpvsNG0eNLwdiqKdVxeo4ehH_pU&s=r) and I would highly recommend it for anyone wanting to dive a little deeper. Fundamentally, they discuss how crypto has always been about what you can do and NFTs, what you can own, but there is something more at play here and that is who you can become.\n\nOwnership of an NFT has often been associated with identity but this concept has the potential to play a much bigger role in our daily lives than just being a member of the latest cool trend. NFTs [represent](https://www.web3.university/tracks/build-your-first-nft) a new file format, our digital social identities are rapidly growing and for the first time this measure of culture and community can be neatly packaged in a way that can be just as easily interpreted by computers as it can be by people.\n\nWe humans are tribalistic beings, we long for belonging and to be a part of something. As owners of NFTs we will be people with [wallets](https://metamask.io/) and these wallets can be connected to discord channels, dapps and marketplaces as a means of communicating said identity. \"NFTs are a new token of meaning on the internet for 'fit in, and stand out', one of the most important raw ingredients for so many wonderful things in the world - culture, community, commerce\" says Alex who is working on what he refers to as Tokengated Commerce, taking this idea of signifying community membership and applying it to consumer experiences. \n\nIn the form of digital art NFTs are an output of commerce but following this they can evolve to be an input for commerce. Imagine shopping online but when you connect your wallet the retailer’s platform responds in a way that acknowledges you. This recognition has the power to be leveraged in a way that promotes inclusion far beyond any of the loyalty programs we see currently. The ‘gated’ aspect will gamify the experience to an extent as well, making certain products or real life experiences unlockable dependent on your identity, we have seen the beginning of this already with [Coachella](https://nft.coachella.com/bloom) utilising rare flower NFTs for specific area access, redemption mechanisms for products and other rare experiences.  In his [Three Stages of Adoption](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ftx_the-three-stages-of-nft-adoption-a-hypothesis-ugcPost-6925816246831603712-bjsB/?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=android_app), FTX’s Trystan Yver describes how this idea of owning digital items that tie back to real life things in particular is how we will onboard the next wave of adopters. The combination of an increasingly personalised experience and one that plays to scarcity by limiting access and creating a challenge for consumers is one that will have a dramatic impact on everyone in the transition to [web3](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blockchain-coming-together-says-berners-200956278.html).\n\n![Source: 2022 In Bloom FTX NFT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZXGFl5jJLSiPwg9zxyzNC.png?height=632&width=744)\n\n**Identification and Verification**\n\nWhat makes NFTs so special is their ability to act as a digital identifier that can be controlled using the integrated smart contracts. This in particular is a benefit that can offer wide ranging practical use for individuals in every walk of life. Medical records and personal identification documents being the most obvious. Both of which are traditionally difficult to access and even harder to replace. Putting the control back into the hands of the individual as opposed to the large health institutions would increase confidentiality and allow the individual to dictate the specific information shared when seeking treatment without disclosing personal data that they wish to keep private.\n\nAnything that is unique can be represented digitally and secured to an NFT. Although the most common use for these special tokens has been in the mediums of digital rarities like artwork and collectibles, their ability to act as a digital representation for something could be extended to even us humans. \n\nAs adoption increases, we could occupy a world where an individual is issued an NFT birth certificate. Inextricably linked to the individual, this could be the start of establishing a digital record of identification and form the basis for which to link medical records that can be tracked in NFT form. \n\nA similar principle of identification can be applied to products within the manufacturing process. Take car manufacturing for example, by linking each individual part with a non fungible signature, which could be as simple as a QR code, the automotive supply chain would allow the manufacturer to trace the components in a way that in the event of a recall, could save the company billions if dollars each year by reducing the number of vehicles that would need to be recalled. \n\nWarehouse administration is another aspect of the supply chain that has the potential for radical increase in efficiency through the new standards blockchain enables. Inaccurate inventory can be costly for companies and we know all too well the scope for human error in conventional databases. By incorporating a digital identity that can move with the physical item we reduce the inventory related inaccuracies and increase the authenticity of the original, something that is becoming apparent in the luxury goods industry. \n\nLouis Vuitton [announced](https://www.euronews.com/culture/2022/02/19/fashion-and-blockchain-how-louis-vuitton-and-friends-are-digitising-your-threads) plans to use an NFT optimised supply chain to identify their goods and provide increased transparency throughout the products manufacturing process, adding to the uniqueness and quality. In the past five years we have seen a clear shift in sustainably focused firms and transparency has been a big driver in the promotion of this. As the luxury brands pave the way for what is possible, in the future we may see this authenticity flow down to some more accessible daily products such as clothing or coffee, where us consumers feel strongly about transparency in the entire supply chain process.\n\n![Source: Blockchain in Procurement and Supply Chain](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GjcUD4fEjtufdB9Oi6pM4.png?height=415&width=877)\n\nThe above are mere examples of things that can be easily integrated onto the blockchain via digital twins. Taking this concept of ownership verification there are a plethora of assets with historically clunky proof of ownership systems that we can apply this ideology to. Traditionally, conducting high value asset transactions digitally was uncommon. The process of buying a house can be a stressful experience for most lucky enough to experience it. Consisting of a long winded process with multiple parties involved in substantial paperwork facilitating the deed transfer. The smart contracts that underpin NFTs would allow this asset class and many others that have been notoriously illiquid, to be tokenised and traded as easily as you would trade a cryptocurrency. \n\nMarx Rowan, chief executive officer of Apollo Global Management Inc. said in an episode of “[Bloomberg Wealth with David Rubenstein](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/the-blockworks-group_apollo-ceo-500-billion-aum-on-the-potential-ugcPost-6929371971033956352-xkmL?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=android_app).” “Many of the rails or the technology or the platforms or the systems that support what’s happening in NFT are actually the precursor to changes in our financial system and we ignore them at our peril.” \n\nWork In Fintech's very own [Benyamin Ahmed](https://twitter.com/ObiWanBenoni), NFT [millionaire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abPmJwXan9c) at 12 years old and the youngest ever guest [lecturer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHUWaLcLau8) at Oxford University, will be talking more about digital identities and looking at how this generational shift will propel society further into the digital universe at [NFT.NYC](https://www.nft.nyc/). \n\nFollow [Work In Fintech](https://workinfintech.com/) for more information and to stay up to date as this new technology continues to shape our world.\n\n \n  \n ", "timestamp": 1653245732, "digest": "mQi4RkO97g8cqCnVunD_9kcBoskYxAx3ZC8YDS6ag44", "contributor": "0xcb1dad8Eb819F5E4AFD54284050aCE97Ca900464"}

Jesus, Grayson. What strength?” came his sister’s voice through the phone.\n\nGrayson squinted through the dawn sun at the bottle of pills he had grabbed from his bedside table: *Losonil. Memory Loss. For A Sound Mind.* “Extra Strength… 1 year.”\n\n“I knew it! Just like all the other cowards!”\n\n“Sis, please. There’s nothing?”\n\n“Nothing. You left nothing. You told me nothing. There’s no fucking note. The gall. After everything you’ve said.”\n\n“Everything I said?”\n\n“You haven’t even read the news yet haven’t you? Go fuck yourself. No wonder she left you.”\n\nClick.\n\nSilence.\n\nStealing himself from the dizzy desire to expel whatever food he ate last night, Grayson swiped past a year’s worth of missing data on his phone to open the browser. He took a deep breath and opened the headlines.\n\n*Private Message Leak Continues to Wreak Havoc.*\n\n*Who Is The Hacker? Search Continues.*\n\n*Never Reader Groups Protest Face2Face Offices.*\n\n*Calls for Social Debt Jubilee Rises.*\n\n*New York Opens Additional Mental Health Clinics.*\n\n*Layoffs at Face2Face Continue.*\n\n*Bank CEOs Say That Their Money Is Safe.*\n\nAs Grayson scrolled through the news, the pieces fell into place.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a hack of Face2Face was revealed. By breaking the encryption through an unknown method, about a year’s worth of private messages and location data from a billion people were collected by a hacker, and leaked. Almost immediately, as the world verified the truth of it, the fallout began. At a college party in Georgetown the beer pong and loud EDM turned down to hushes. A woman left an apartment in Cape Town with all her belongings in a box, slamming the door in the face of her now ex-boyfriend. A woman in Dubai called her sister in Mumbai to ask if she knew about their father. A Hong Kong man threw xiaolongbao at his friend, asking him why he lied about the money. In Sydney, a friend texted another friend wondering why they were always so afraid to share the truth of how they felt towards each other. In Buenos Aires, a woman cried and kissed a fading picture of her husband after learning the truth about his death. A father in Reykjavik cried over hearing his daughter’s last, joyful voice notes sent to her friends before the accident.\n\nAt first, it was all individual stories of pain, guilt, and frustration, but also of joy, release, and closure. New connections and disconnections. But, then, the fallout snowballed into groups: Never Readers, Forgivers, and Transparenters to name a few. Never Readers resisted the temptation and vowed to stay with the true intent. They wished to not violate the consent of those who discussed things in private. The Never Readers had its own sub-groups, with one side going with the flow (the Flow Nevers). Their belief was: it happened, it doesn’t need to be read, and that’s okay. The other (the Never Evers), vowed to destroy the dataset through any means possible. It was an abomination and a temptation that had to be forever erased.\n\nThe Forgivers read the dataset, but vowed to accept the true nature of humanity. None of us were perfect after all: we bad mouth others, cheat, and lie. Now that the truth was out: we forgive and move on. However, the Transparenters were a bit more radical: believing that this represented a new reality and evolution for society. We should all be transparent with all our thoughts with everyone around us. It was telepathy, a way to grow collectively, and to erase the harm of the ego.\n\nThe world economy also fell off a cliff. Not only did most people stop using social media, but it was uncertain whether any technology was reliably encrypted: the entire bedrock of the world economy. It faltered, with group CEOs of the Fortune 500 coming together to issue a statement saying that while investigations continue, they believe it was only an issue at Face2Face. The hacker was also still on the loose, having managed to hide their tracks. It was then that Grayson checked his phone again. He couldn’t log into his Face2Face work email. Smearing his hands through his face as if it would somehow paint back a year’s worth of memories, he ghosted towards the kitchen and rang his colleague. Inside the fridge was a sandwich with a note to himself: “This is the only thing you get. Sorry. - Grayson”.\n\nAs he inspected it, his colleague answered. “Grayson? Yo. What’s up?”\n\nBiting off a mouthful of egg and bacon, and briefly pausing with it in his mouth, Grayson responded. “Rick…”\n\n“Grayson?”\n\n“Rick…”\n\n“Oh shit. Fuck. G. You didn’t? You promised!”\n\nSwallowing more of the sandwich, Grayson replied with a clearer voice. “I did. Rick. Holy shit. Please tell me I told you something?”\n\n“Well, fuck. This is not good-”\n\n“Why did I take it? Wait, why?”\n\n“Shit, this is not good. Shit. Shit. Okay-”\n\n“Rick, what’s going on?”\n\n“Where are you? At your apartment?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“They are coming today. Meet me at Dawns in thirty. We can’t talk about this over the phone.”\n\nGrayson pulled back his phone to check the day of the week. It was Monday. “I don’t have a job anymore, do I?”\n\n“Right on, dickhead. I don’t either. See you soon. I’ll explain.”\n\nClick.\n\nSilence.\n\nGrayson wolfed down the rest of his breakfast sandwich and jumped into the shower. When the condensation evaporated he saw a self he did not remember: neat haircut, chiseled abs, and a smooth face. After a short walk, he arrived at Dawns to the smell of coffee, breakfast, and a hint of newly cleaned floors. Scanning the room, a wave from a table in the corner greeted him and he hesitantly walked over amidst a TV blaring the news.\n\n“Yeah, I’ve let go a bit from when you last would remember me. It’s been tough on everyone,” Rick said as Grayson sat down.\n\n“What’s going on?”\n\n“We were all fired. Most of Face2Face got fired. But, since then, our team has been placed under investigation and-”\n\n“They think we did it?” Grayson asked as the waitress arrived.\n\n“We’ll just have some coffee. Thank you,” Rick replied before turning back to Grayson.\n\n“Actually, hang on,” Grayson said, turning towards the waitress before she left. “Can you turn down the TV? It’s a bit much.” She frowned a bit and then nodded affirmatively before heading to the kitchen. “Continue”, he said to Rick.\n\n“Yes, so, yeah. They think we did it. And our lawyers were coming today to take statements to bolster our case. Taking Losonil *the* day before, do you know what that looks like?”\n\n“Yes, I’m not stupid.”\n\n“Then why Grayson?! Are you sure you left no note?”\n\n“Nothing besides my other self leaving me a sandwich, nope. And if there’s one thing I know about myself. I won’t leave myself a fucking treasure hunt.”\n\nRick sighed after a sip of coffee. “Dude. Okay. Well. The lawyers are still coming today… Just tell them the truth, please. And when you can, please check the leaked database. Anything will help our case, even if you took Losonil. Have you looked at the dataset at all?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“About two months in, we switched all our internal comms to exclusively use Face2Face internally. It’s all there. Maybe there’s something in there that will help us.” Grayson was silent as he sipped his coffee. “You’re not going to reply to that? After all we’ve been through?”\n\n“Rick. Relax. I just lost a year of my life. I don’t have a job anymore. The world is in chaos. We’re apparently under investigation? It’s not even obvious that combing through this dataset will actually help us. I also apparently had a girlfriend that left me? None of this makes sense at all. Rick-”\n\n“I know, I know,” Rick replied, catching his breath. “Just. Anything will help at this point.”\n\n“You think someone on our team did it?”\n\n“I didn’t think so, but with more of the team taking Losonil…”\n\n“Who else did?”\n\n“Li did. Aphiwe did… Your ex also. Allison.”\n\n“Is… is that why we broke up? When did she join the team? Do you have a picture of us?”\n\nRick pulled out of his phone, opened his photos and started scrolling through it. Grayson put down his coffee and leaned across the table. Before Rick could get to a photo he suddenly closed his phone.\n\n“You know what. No,” Rick suddenly responded. “Stop changing the subject.” Grayson pulled back in his seat frowning at his friend. “You broke your promise. How can I actually trust you after this?”\n\n“Who is she, Rick?! What did she do to me?!” Grayson shouted at his old friend, yanking the phone from his hand.\n\nRick stole his phone back and stood up. “So close Grayson. So close. You actually were so close to changing for the better.” Rick left towards the door.\n\n“I’m just looking for answers!”\n\n“Everyone is, asshole. Can’t even say sorry. Maybe stop looking elsewhere for your answers,” Rick shouted into Dawns before exiting into the morning outside.\n\nThe waitress returned and asked if he was sure he didn’t want some food. He nodded no, downed the coffee, dropped some dollars on the table and left. Outside, he lit a cigarette as a faceless crowd with placards mobbed towards the local park. The only part of their chant he could hear was “Face 2 Face”. Staring into the road as if it hid the answers from him, he took a deep draw of the cigarette and turned the other way back towards his apartment.\n\nWhen he arrived, two men in suits and briefcases were waiting for him next to a statue of a bird he did not recall buying. Grayson straightened himself and walked towards them.\n\n“Mr. Cave. It’s me, Austin, and this is my colleague, whom you’ve also met, Gerard. How are you?”\n\n“Good, and you can call me Grayson,” as he shook their hands and led them inside. As they opened up their tablets on the kitchen table, Grayson interrupted. “Listen. I’m going to make this easy on you. I took Losonil last night. A year’s worth.”\n\nThey kept typing, and then suddenly stopped. “Wait. Can you repeat that?”\n\n“Gerard, right?” Grayson asked as he pointed at the one with the balding head. “I don’t remember you. I took Losonil. Should I say it again?”\n\n“You took Losonil right before we could help you? Why?”\n\n“If I knew why, it wouldn’t be a memory loss pill, now would it?”\n\n“Are you insane?!”\n\nAustin, the one with the big glasses, shifted in his seat, “...okay, guys. Relax.”\n\n“He took Losonil. The day before taking statements. What are we doing here?”\n\nGrayson offered a solution. “Look, if you can figure out why, then we both win, no?”\n\nClosing his tablet, Gerard stood up and started searching through the apartment.\n\n“You could’ve just asked,” Grayson responded to the lawyer going through his stuff.\n\n“Sorry about that,” Austin chimed in.\n\n“It’s fine. There’s no treasure hunt here. I would’ve made it more obvious.”\n\n“Do you mind if we go through your apartment? We’re here to help.”\n\nGrayson looked at Gerard scanning in between stacked books. “Your partner is already doing so. Go ahead.” As much as he hoped that they might find something, he let out a sigh of relief when they finally left with nothing in hand.\n\nAs soon as the door closed behind them, Grayson downloaded the leaked dataset. Amidst the general chatter of tasks and project management comms from his old team, he found her full name: *Allison Bleicher*. He copy-pasted it into the dataset’s search bar and for a moment hesitated before he hit search. A warmth rose up in him and he went to the kitchen to pour a glass of water first. He took a deep breath and hit enter.\n\nThere she was. A beautiful dark-haired woman with blue eyes and a button nose. She was into birds, running, cryptography, and old French films. His hands started shaking as he entered both their names into the search bar. *Allison Bleicher. Grayson Cave.*\n\nHe lurched at the life he won’t ever get back again. They were in love. He effortlessly said all the right things. They were very much in love. He kept scrolling through the early days of their relationship until he halted at a picture of her in lacey lingerie. He moved his chair back, and then suddenly closed his computer. After pacing around in his apartment, he opened the dataset again and entered his own name.\n\nThe past 365 days actually went well. Even went to the gym more often. He pulled up his shirt and felt his abs again. He tapped his nails on his laptop, shook his head, and typed in their names again. The lacey lingerie photo appeared again. With a deep breath he kept scrolling until the photos shared between them undressed themselves to her naked body. The cursor inched closer and hovered over her hips and her breasts. He had responded with his own warm, sunset nude.\n\n*>>* I’m the luckiest man in the world. :heart-eyes-emoji:. You have a body that belongs in a gallery for all the world to see.\n\n<< :winky-face-emoji: We’ll both be on those pedestals one day. For now though. You know where to find me…\n\nThe next message was 16 minutes later.\n\n*>>* I’m outside.\n\nThe next message was a few hours later.\n\n<< Thanks for last night. You’re welcome to apply for a membership pass to this gallery. :winky-face-emoji:\n\nAs he continued scrolling through their relationship, it was all positive messages of affirmation and love. Despite seeing the body of a woman he once shared, what made him choke up the most was hearing her voice: a kind, happy, and gentle voice. One such voice note, left during a humid summer’s day on her way to the grocery store, left her slightly out of breath after listing the ingredients for their dinner. The cicadas sang in the background. As it got closer to the date of the leak, Grayson’s heart kept beating faster. And then, all of a sudden, it ended.\n\n*>>* You are so obsessed with your work. You changed. I can’t anymore. We have to talk.\n\nA week later, the leak was revealed. He logged onto Face2Face to find his account still active, living in a ghost town. All other social media too. In the wake of the hack, 80% of users deleted their accounts. The Allison Bleicher of today was nowhere to be seen. Her number was still in the database, however. He called it.\n\nA dead tone.\n\nHe sighed and called Rick.\n\nIt rang.\n\nIt rang.\n\nIt went to voicemail.\n\n“Hey. Rick. Sorry about this morning. Can we talk? The lawyers were here. I let them look through my apartment. They found nothing. I still know nothing. I’ve looked at the database, but it would really help if I could ask you some questions. Call me.”\n\nClick.\n\nSilence.\n\nHe sighed, ordered some Chinese takeaway, and searched online for any news about leases. It confirmed what he wanted to know: many people had moved after the dataset leaked. There were fresh calls from congress to consider a lease jubilee, allowing anyone to exit without penalties. He started typing in Allison’s name in the search bar alongside the request to display all associated locations. His hand hovered over the “Enter” button, but he pulled back, and slammed his fist into the table to noodles and chopsticks flinging out from his takeaway.\n\nHe recalled his conversations today. His sister shouting at him: “*Who do you think you are?!*” Rick telling him to: “*...maybe stop looking elsewhere for your answers*”, and Allison’s last message to him: “*...you’ve changed*”. In his notepad, he scribbled: *Who am I?*\n\nIn the dataset, he searched for all mentions of himself. Rumours, whispers, and messages from people orbiting his life. Unlike some people who discovered newfound loneliness after discovering that no one ever talked about them, Grayson found plenty of chatter. It crossed the scope of the human condition.\n\nFrom the good:\n\n“Grayson is a great candidate! Definitely send the offer letter.”\n\n“Yeah, Grayson is also coming. He usually makes this kickass cocktail. Also, knows a shit-ton about obscure poetry. You’ll love him.”\n\n“I miss Grayson, man. Wish he didn’t move.”\n\nTo sexual, “Did you see Grayson’s abs lately? The thirst traps on Face2Face. Um. Yum.”\n\nBut, most of it was negative.\n\n“Why are you still dating him? Does he even listen?”\n\n“Can’t we do something? He literally hogs all the meetings?”\n\n“Can’t you call him? Please, he’s just gonna gaslight me again.”\n\n“Is Grayson coming? He sometimes gets just so abrasive when he’s had a few drinks.”\n\nHe searched for any open source tools that would allow him to get a bigger picture. Not a lot existed, but there were open source libraries for people who wanted to run sentiment analysis on people: insert your name and you would get a word cloud of positive and negative associations. Another interesting one: the serendipity maximizer. It went through the dataset and determined the person in the dataset that would be the most unlikely person that you should’ve met in your life. All those strange coincidences that should’ve happened, but never did. It reminded him of a conversation with Allison that he read a few hours earlier.\n\n<< G. Isn’t it weird that through all of time and space, we managed to meet?\n\n*>>* Life is weird, yeah. A wonderful coincidence. Serendipity at its finest.\n\n<< No, but like specifically. What are the actual odds? If I didn’t meet Skye at that party, so many things would’ve been different. We would never have been put in touch. I wish I knew.\n\n*>>* We would’ve met. I’m sure of it.\n\nWhen he entered his name into the serendipity maximizer, it popped up a name that, as expected, he had never heard of: *Hel Witte*. Grayson frowned as he browsed through what was available of Hel’s life. Seemingly quite active, socially, but only a few photos of others in his life. Although they were supposed to have met, with their apparent coincidental proximity, they haven’t. He scribbled in his notebook: *“Come back to Hel Witte…”*\n\nGrayson kept searching for more open source libraries, but didn’t find any of use. There was one thing he was now after and it was in the notebook, encircled with more thoughts.\n\n*“Who am I? -> I am not myself. I’m the stories in everyone else’s heads. I’m not one person. I’m a composite self. I am many.”*\n\nSo, after hours of work, the sun already having set, he combined the serendipity maximizer and the sentiment analytical tool to create a new tool: one that would create a composite self. It was the combination of what everyone said, influenced and embedded into the social graph of his life. Those closest to him had the highest impacts and weak connections elsewhere had less. When combined, would see his full and real self. After the data crunched, the bright screen in the dark night illuminated the question Grayson was after. There he was, the real complex, messy Grayson. It was an indescribable mirror that suddenly forced tears into his eyes. It was his younger self that felt the joy, the one that was always bullied for misunderstanding. It was his younger self that didn’t have the luxury to know what needed to be done before he was punished for being clueless. All those selves pushed tears into his face, blurring the composite self on the screen into what he always wanted to see. He understood himself. Despite this joy, there was a part of himself that glowed dark: his utter selfishness. It wasn’t long before that consumed him again.\n\nHis notebook had collected a new scribble: *“If you could know your composite self and see everything that influenced it, could you manipulate it?”*\n\nBased on his model of the composite self, he determined possible ways that one could manipulate it. Some actions were more powerful. For example, initial impressions and first mentions had a strong halo effect: it lasted very long. Additionally, it seemed that manipulating the social graph itself would also alter his composite self. New people that entered a social circle would drastically alter the composite selves of everyone they directly touched, even to second and third degrees of separation. After he ranked the actions to their strengths, he polled through the dataset to see if there were any instances where these strong manipulative actions clustered unexpectedly. Somewhere in the early morning, energy drink in hand and new stubble on his face, his stomach lurched again - and it wasn’t from missing dinner.\n\nSomeone had indeed been using these strong manipulative methods to alter their composite selves, and it was a name he’d seen before: *Hel Witte*. A man he had never known that was his highest serendipity match: someone who he should’ve met in his life, but never did. With what space was left in his notebook, he wrote in bold: *“COULD THIS BE THE HACKER? WHO IS HEL WITTE?!”*\n\nGrayson put Hel Witte’s name into Face2Face, and there he was, not deleted. An anomaly.\n\nOpening up the messenger, Grayson shakingly typed: “Hey?”\n\nHis heart pounded as the person on the other end was typing …\n\n<< Hey Grayson. I knew this might happen.\n\n*>>* What? I don’t understand?\n\n<< Do you want to know who I am?\n\n*>>* Yes.\n\n<< Then this was the only way. Trust me. Come find me here.\n\n<Location Pin Shared\\*>\\*\n\n*>>* Who are you?\n\nThere was no further reply. Entering the pin on Face2Face Maps revealed a location a short drive away in an old warehouse. His eyes darted around, uncertain if this was a memory he was supposed to remember. He entered this location, and Hel Witte into the dataset. Nothing for the latter, but the location popped up occasionally, precisely for what it seemed to be: a seemingly empty warehouse. Squinting at the screen, hoping that it would reveal who Hel Witte was, Grayson called Rick again.\n\nIt rang.\n\nIt rang.\n\nIt rang. Click. Silence. No voicemail.\n\nHe took a deep breath and searched for his name alongside his sister. There, in a message to a co-worker, was the Grayson that his sister rejected.\n\n<< This firewall bug feels like my ex, lol. Seemingly impenetrable, but if you push the right button, it all falls down.\n\n*>>* I know the feeling. Sounds like my sister, tbh. So scared of life that she feels compelled to lash out at everything with even the slightest breeze against her. Makes her a bit of a bitch.\n\nHe called her.\n\nIt rang.\n\nIt rang.\n\nIt rang. It went to voicemail.\n\n“Hey, this is Steph. I’m not at the phone right now. Please leave a message if you are the kind of person who likes to leave a message. Voice notes are also fine. Okay, bye.”\n\n“Hey, sis. I’m sorry about what I said. I truly am. I found the messages I wrote. Can I make it up to you? I’ll bring you some key lime pie? Listen. I need to know something. Do you know a Hel Witte? The dataset says you do? Call me back when you can, please.”\n\nWhen Grayson put the phone down, he realised partly why no one was answering. It was 5:12 AM. He looked towards his bed and towards his apartment door. After a deep breath, he threw on some warmer clothes, picked up his keys, and jumped into his car to the radio blaring an early morning talk show on the hack. He turned it off and drove towards the warehouse.\n\nOn the highway, the first signs of the dawn gradient painted itself on the horizon. It was cold and fresh as the Sisyphean sun swept the night away. Alongside ads for injury lawyers, a billboard stood out: “God always knew everything. Repent, forgive, and trust Him.”\n\nWhen Grayson arrived at the warehouse and turned off the rumbling engine, the silence rang in his ears. The only noise was the distant highway and early planes jetting consultants off to cities elsewhere.\n\nA door into the warehouse was ajar with a light clawing into the yard. He edged closer as the crunchy cold dust pierced underneath his boots through the morning silence. Peering around the door’s frame, he suddenly winced back when he saw about ten silhouettes inside. He tried to slow down his breath, but his heart felt like a kick drum, booming away.\n\nNothing. He heard nothing. Peering back around the frame, holding his gaze, he saw that the silhouettes weren’t moving. He inched in and his eyes acclimated to the static crowd in front of him. It was cardboard cutouts with question marks on them. Frowning, he moved through the crowd to a tiny table at the back of the warehouse. On it, was a phone plugged into a power outlet. He picked it up and it instantly recognized his face, unlocking it.\n\nShaking and dizzy, he picked up the phone to see that there was one text file on it that simply said: README. He tapped on it, and it prompted for a password. He tried some of his own passwords, but none worked. Looking around, he found nothing that could indicate that there was a password nearby. Grayson tried recalling parts of what he had read about Hel Witte. He tried a bunch of long shots, to no avail. His stomach churned after not having had dinner, taking him back to the sandwich he left himself the day before. Frowning, Grayson typed: “This is the only thing you get. Sorry. - Grayson.”\n\nIt opened and the first sentence took his breath away.\n\n“Hey Grayson. I knew this might happen. Hel Witte isn’t real. I created him. Or, *we*, created him. I am your other self. I left this letter to you. You hacked Face2Face and you leaked the dataset. I’ll tell you why, and I’ll tell you why I took Losonil.”\n\nGrayson fell to his knees as he rested his back against the table legs before continuing to read the letter he wrote to himself.\n\n“By the fact that you found this letter, it tells me that what I might tell you, won’t be new. It all started a month into your memory loss. By accident you discovered a serious vulnerability in the key generation of Face2Face’s encryption. This also affected end-to-end encryption. The possibilities were intoxicating. For so many years, you’ve felt misunderstood, and this meant that maybe, finally, you could get out of your rut and understand so many more things: yourself, the world, and others. You didn’t hesitate.\n\n“During this initial data gathering phase, Allison joined the team. At first, there was light playful attention between you and her, but when it didn’t go further, you saw it as the perfect time to finally use the power you had at your fingertips. Slowly, but surely, learning who she was, you changed yourself and said exactly the right things. It worked, and you grew closer. Once the relationship worked, the desire did not go away. It burned in you, to know more. Delusions of grandeur spiraled and you knew that the most important project you could do, was to perfect the use of this dataset to your benefit. You always wanted to know yourself, and now you could. You saw, in real-time, how the dataset moved and morphed: words, messages, and actions spiraling into new connections and disconnections. In order to gain power over this beast, you had to know yourself. So, you built the composite self: a combined person of all the people you are to others.\n\n“Many variables were involved, including yourself, where others were in the social graph, what they said about you, and where they were. That moment you first saw your full self, you were in ecstasy. And then, you became all powerful. You could see how any and all actions in your circle affected you. And so, with your composite self, you started crafting the version you wanted to be. By saying the right things at the right time, and introducing the right people to each other, you saw in real time how your composite self improved. But, your hubris got the best of you. All of this manipulation started seeping into the people around you. Allison left you because you became consumed by altering your composite self. At first, with her leaving, it even improved your composite self because she blocked you. Slowly, but surely, the feedback loop went into the wrong direction. You increasingly manipulated yourself, even to the point of personal abuse.\n\n“When the composite self didn’t change the way you wanted it to, you even punished yourself. In your wake was not just a self destroyed, but also the wreckage of many broken relationships. It all came to a head when the woman who was there for you, for all your life, was ostracized to improve your self image. After you sent that message to your sister, the cracks of the composite self appeared and you came face to face with yourself.\n\n“Staring ever deeper into this abyss, drunk on creating a new you, you saw the real Grayson that was led to this point: a Grayson that just needed self-love. You didn’t need to manipulate yourself into a perfect you, you just had to accept what you’ve done and who you’ve become. You are just human, Grayson. Flawed, like everyone else. Just a human that tries to do good with the world that forced them into the spaces and times they weren’t ready for. From the brink, however, you could see the void that awaited others and humanity if this power was left unchecked: an undetectable human with vast manipulative power. If they didn’t have a filter, the world would never be the same.\n\n“The entire system had to be nuked. By leaking the dataset, trust in private communications on social media would evaporate. It would be costly for society, but worth it. You, however, would still be a broken God. While you would save humanity from a potential disaster, you achieved an epiphany at the cost of the lives of others. You manipulated the people around you to arrive at this point. You had to atone to truly deserve this epiphany. You could’ve asked for forgiveness, but it would be meaningless without the entire truth that you were the hacker. That wasn’t a cost you would then consider to bear. And so, the most meaningful atonement would be merely to forget the epiphany. You would take Losonil and delete as much of this past year from your life as you can.\n\n“However, I knew that there was a possibility that having forgotten this entire year, I would follow the same path without the lesson I had learned. Even though the dataset wouldn’t be real time anymore and people would stop using private social media, I was afraid you would somehow continue down a dark path and cause more destruction again in your wake. I still had a duty to stop that from happening, and so instead of just leaving a note on your bedside table, I would only intervene if you arrived at the same conclusion: that a dataset like this would be used to manipulate others. I moved many of the manipulations I did in the past year and split it into a fake person: *Hel Witte*. By baiting your curiosity, I knew if you arrived at Hel Witte, I’d be able to get you out here and share the truth with you. You know yourself, but not nearly as well as you think you do. The faceless crowd in this room is there to help you answer the question that’s been plaguing you, your entire life.\n\n*Who am I?*\n\nRather, the question should be. *Who are we not?*\n\nWhile you now know the full truth again, you’re back where you started. You’ve failed. It’s time to truly atone.\n\nI love you, asshole.”\n\nThe screen turned black and he saw himself briefly in the reflection before a choice appeared.\n\n“In five minutes, the phone will notify the press of your hack, the way it happened, and why you did it. *Or*, you can cancel this countdown and erase the phone. I know what I would do, do you?”", "timestamp": 1653245793, "digest": "g6Ugf8LFFYLmjei4otUckKjvfPRNiIkqeVyvtmjPlCQ", "contributor": "0x4086583a20335BA5a333547b6D5327aD6e002261"}

The total amount of refunded compensation was nearly 80million yuan, and the Simba Kwai account number was permanently closed.\n\nOn May 11, the relevant person in charge of Henan Consumer Association declined the interview with e-Law of Finance and economics. The relevant person in charge of Simba team introduced the main dispute focus in the trial.\n\nSpecifically include: whether Henan consumer association can put forward the lawsuit claim of “refund one compensation three”; Whether the company involved should jointly bear the responsibility of “one refund and three compensation”, and if necessary, how to calculate the amount of refund and compensation that should be borne by all parties; Whether there is a legal basis for permanently shutting down Simba and its companies’ live studio accounts; Whether Henan Consumer Association has performed its public welfare duties before litigation.\n\nAs a new form of e-commerce rising in recent years, the introduction, display and publicity of products brought by live broadcasting have broken through the regulatory scope of laws and regulations such as advertising law. At present, a series of laws and regulations have been issued, including the code of conduct for webcast marketing, the measures for the supervision and administration of online transactions and the measures for the administration of webcast marketing (for Trial Implementation). The regulatory authorities have also launched special rectification actions to make it clear that “the problem of illegal and illegal profits shall be strictly dealt with”, including the false publicity of marketing goods.\n\nIn the view of Ma Xiangxiang, partner of Beijing Anjie law firm, “there is a complete and mature rule system for live broadcasting with goods. However, in specific practice, relevant subjects need to comply with the requirements of laws and regulations”. She pointed out that a remarkable feature of digital economic governance is multiple collaborative governance. Therefore, consumer organizations, industry associations and other institutions should play an important role in the supervision and governance of live broadcasting and goods.\n\nTherefore, the lawsuit initiated by Henan Consumer Association is known as the first public interest litigation case of live delivery of goods. All parties believe that this case is of great significance to the normative development of this emerging industry.\n\n01\n\nThe whole story of “false bird’s nest incident”\n\nAt the end of October 2020, consumers pointed out that the bird’s nest sold by Simba’s anchor “Shida Meili” in the live studio was actually sugar water. On November 27 of the same year, Simba issued a letter of apology, saying that when the involved “Mingzhi” bird’s nest products were promoted and sold in the live broadcasting room, “there was indeed exaggerated publicity, and the ingredient of bird’s nest was less than 2G per bowl”. Simba put forward the “first compensation scheme”, recalled all the “Mingzhi” brand bird’s nest products sold in Xinxuan live studio, and promised to refund one for three.\n\nOn December 23 of the same year, the Guangzhou municipal market supervision bureau reported the investigation and handling situation and planned to impose an administrative penalty of ordering Guangzhou Heyi e-commerce Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Guangzhou Heyi”), the founder of the live broadcasting room involved, to stop the illegal act and impose a fine of 900000 yuan. Guangzhou Rongyu Trading Co., Ltd., the main seller of goods involved in the case, was ordered to stop the illegal act and fined 2 million yuan.\n\nOn the same day, the official microblog of Kwai e-commerce also announced that after the incident, the brand’s bird’s nest products were taken off the shelves of Kwai e-commerce in the whole station, and the e-commerce function of “Shida Meili” account was banned for 14 days; Xin Youzhi (Simba), the person in charge of Heyi in Guangzhou to which the anchor belongs, was required to properly deal with the after-sales problems and cooperate with the investigation of relevant departments. The live broadcast of Xin Youzhi’s personal account was suspended from November 17.\n\nThe announcement also said that according to the investigation and handling by the Guangzhou municipal market supervision bureau, Kwai e-commerce decided to take further measures: from now on, the account of “Shida Meili” will be closed for 60 days; Close Xin Youzhi’s personal account for 60 days. In addition, the accounts of 27 e-commerce anchors of Guangzhou Heyi and its affiliated companies were closed for 15 days, and the company was required to organize their e-commerce anchors for relevant training and learning.\n\nHowever, the incident did not end here. In August, 2021, Henan consumers’ Association filed a civil public interest lawsuit against Kwai company, Simba and related companies, requiring them to jointly bear the liability of “one refund and three compensation” and joint and several liability, with a total amount of 79.714156 million yuan.\n\nIn January 2022, after the lawsuit was disclosed, Xinxuan group announced that after the “bird’s nest incident”, it had put forward an advance compensation scheme on November 27, 2020, that is, recalling the products of the live broadcasting room and promising to refund one for three. As of January 14, 2022, the company has paid a total of 41.439 million yuan to consumers, and the compensation scheme is still valid.\n\n02\n\nDoes the consumer association have the right to file public interest litigation?\n\nHenan Consumer Association said in the indictment that at the end of December 2020, Henan Consumer Association successively received consumer complaints and complaints. The bird’s nest purchased in Simba live studio had problems and was suspected of cheating consumers. After investigation and verification, it is determined that it infringes on many unspecified consumers (including 2124 transaction notes in Henan Province, with a total transaction amount of 601000 yuan). Henan Consumer Association believes that this incident infringed on the legitimate rights and interests of many unspecified consumers, caused serious damage to social and public interests, and met the legal conditions for filing consumer civil public interest litigation.\n\nAccording to the interpretation of the Supreme People’s Court on Several Issues concerning the application of law in the trial of consumer civil public interest litigation cases (revised in 2020) (hereinafter referred to as the interpretation of consumer civil public interest litigation), which came into force on January 1, 2021, the conduct of the defendant in filing consumer civil public interest litigation infringes the legitimate rights and interests of many unspecified consumers, or has the potential to endanger the personal Proof materials of preliminary evidence of damage to social and public interests such as property safety risk. For the trial of such cases, the court needs to first review the relevant supporting materials submitted by the local consumer association.\n\nAccording to the previous public information, Simba took the initiative to announce the first Refund Scheme of “one refund and three compensation” on November 27, 2020. Simba said that as of the date of the trial, all consumers who can be contacted by Guangzhou Heyi and meet the refund conditions have been compensated.\n\nThen, the Henan Consumer Association submitted a civil complaint to the Henan intermediate people’s court in August 2021.

{"id": "vwTap7ybXRHxRH32kDGCHSh23i_2zyPWD7p6JOVKdGQ", "title": "Is NFT a big change or real hype?", "body": "The number of words in this article: 3368, about 6 minutes when reading\n\nA mosaic painting sold for 450 million yuan, an ape head for 100 million yuan, and a twitter with five English words for 20 million yuan. The seemingly unimaginable cases are not only people’s expectation of the meta universe, but also the result of the “foam” of the prevalence of market speculation and arbitrage. The risk of scalding should be prevented. The yuan universe in full swing urgently needs to put out the virtual fire and eliminate the turnips.\n\n(Chen Qianling, special commentator of Finance and economics e-Law)\n\nThe meta universe of virtual and real fusion has not yet taken shape, but various magical scenes have occurred frequently in reality.\n\nAt Christie’s auction house, the NFT painting “every day: the first five thousand days” by artist beeple was auctioned, and finally dropped the hammer at a sky high price of US $69.346 million (about 450 million yuan). The work is a digital image composed of 5000 works. In contrast, in the same month, Sotheby’s auction house held the auction of Van Gogh’s masterpiece “Montmartre Street View”, which was sold at a price of 13.091 million euros (about 100 million yuan).\n\nIt sounds puzzling that a pure digital painting is much more expensive than the original work of famous artists.\n\nHowever, it has been proved that beeple’s sky high auction is not an example. In the past two years, the “meta universe works” relying on NFT technology have frequently sold surprisingly high prices——\n\nNBA star curry spent $180000 to buy the “boring monkey” NFT avatar; Sun Yuchen, founder of wave field Tron, took a picture of an ape NFT head for $15 million (about 100 million yuan).\n\nJack Dorsey, the co-founder of twitter, put his first tweet sent out in 2006 on the auction website with only one sentence “just setting up my twttr” and clinched a deal with us $2.9 million (about RMB 18.88 million).\n\nAfter a whole day of fierce competition, the price of the moving picture of “rainbow cat” was finally set at 300 ether coins, which was worth about $560000 at that time.\n\nAll kinds of incredible cases can’t help but make us wonder - why can the works of metauniverse sell at such a high price?\n\n01\n\nWhy are NFT works worth so much money?\n\nFrom the bottom logic, it is people’s optimism and expectation for the complete transformation of the meta universe and the current art market.\n\nWe know that the “value” of works of art lies in its scarcity, emphasizing the exclusivity of the owner in their possession, use, income and disposal. However, in the digital art market, you can easily use and disseminate the works created by the originator in a time-consuming and labor-consuming way by simply “copying” and “pasting”. There are various means of plagiarism, and the problem of authenticity of works is difficult to solve Therefore, the digital art market has failed to open space.\n\nThe “meta universe works” relying on NFT and blockchain technology can solve the key pain points of the traditional digital art market and is expected to burst into vitality no less than that of the traditional art market.\n\nFirst, “protect genuine products”.\n\nThe full English name of NFT is non fungible token, which translates into Chinese: non homogenous token, which is indivisible, irreplaceable and unique. The so-called homogenized token, namely ft (fungible token), can replace and divide each other, that is, there is no difference between an FT in your hand and an FT in mine.\n\nNon homogeneous tokens, namely NFT, are unique and inseparable tokens, and each token is unique. Therefore, mapping the works to the blockchain to generate NFT is equivalent to giving it a unique, authentic and permanent identity, which is the key credential to realize the original authentication, and relying on the tamper proof and traceable blockchain technology, it can realize the real record of the whole process of the subsequent transaction flow information of the works, so as to realize the effective ownership of digital works.\n\nThe second is to “crack down on piracy”.\n\n“Infringement relief difficulty” has always been an important problem perplexing network copyright protection. It is difficult to prove, identify and remedy. Under the meta universe technology, if you suspect that your work has been plagiarized, you can find all relevant information in the blockchain, including the information of the creator, “who created what content at what time”, as well as the relevant information of other subjects’ use and possession of the work. At this time, you can take the relevant records as judicial evidence. This change has undoubtedly greatly reduced the cost of proof for the parties.\n\nThe third is “revenue recovery”.\n\nIn the traditional art trade, once the works are sold, they can only get a one-time return. However, in the form of meta universe, since the transaction link can be executed through smart contract, each transaction can be recorded automatically, which makes it possible for the creator to “get a share” from each subsequent circulation of the work. In the smart contract, the creator can agree on a certain proportion of subsequent revenue sharing, so the payment of each transaction can be automatically withdrawn to his account in each re circulation of the work.\n\nIt can be predicted that with the continuous maturity of metauniverse technologies such as NFT and blockchain, the solution of traditional copyright problems will completely open the digital content market, and the whole links of production, circulation and distribution of works will be reshaped.\n\n02\n\nThe risk of heat to scald needs to be paid attention to\n\nAlthough metacosmic technologies such as NFT have great advantages in stimulating the vitality of original ecology and promoting the reform and innovation of art market, they also have problems and risks that can not be underestimated.\n\nFirst of all, as the saying goes, the ideal is full and the reality is skinny. Although metauniverse has great potential to subvert the digital content market, it is still a long way from the realization of the vision.\n\nTo realize the copyright protection of metacosmic works, the key is to “link the works”. However, as the blockchain technology is not yet fully mature, the larger the file of NFT works, the higher the storage cost on the chain. Therefore, at present, most NFT artworks are still stored in the form of off chain. In this case, they can only rely on the centralized server. Once the server is attacked, the security of the works will be greatly threatened.\n\nAnd even if we can “work on the chain”", "timestamp": 1653246048, "digest": "qaIzTjGb6c59V2XgwcvWPoAQz79rlLlV4n_WMqXvfOA", "contributor": "0x92Cce496362F3039d7746BCBEE0aDfA08ca98bDb"}

In the first half of 2018, China made many new breakthroughs and discoveries in the field of science. These new achievements continue to refresh the public’s perception of science and technology, and are also changing our lives.\n\nThe world’s first individual cell cloned monkey was born in China, which has a new prospect for the treatment of major brain diseases\n\nThe picture shows the somatic cloned monkeys “Zhongzhong” and “Huahua” provided by the Chinese Academy of Sciences\n\nAt a press conference held on January 24 this year, the Chinese Academy of Sciences announced that China has achieved somatic cloning of non-human primates for the first time in the world. Cell, an international academic journal of biology, published this achievement as a cover article and was published online on January 25, 2018. This achievement marks that China has taken the lead in opening a new era of using somatic cloned monkeys as experimental animal models, and has realized the transformation of China from international “parallel” to “leading” in the field of non-human primate research.\n\nIn addition to being of great significance in basic research, this achievement also contributes to solving the major challenges in the field of population health in China. It is reported that the use of somatic cell cloning technology to make brain disease model monkeys has brought unprecedented bright prospects for the mechanism research, intervention, diagnosis and treatment of major brain diseases faced by humans.\n\nChinese scientists took the lead in discovering the activation mechanism of human embryos, laying a foundation for eugenics\n\nIn March this year, the Beijing Genomics Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in cooperation with a number of domestic scientific research institutions, revealed the mystery of orderly gene expression, development and evolution of human embryos for the first time in the world. The research results were published in the international academic journal Cell.\n\nResearch shows that almost all kinds of cells in human body have a large number of gene expression. However, about two days after human fertilization is very special, during which there is almost no gene expression in the embryo. Scientists have found the key molecule that initiates the expression of the human genome (Oct4), and found that in the history of evolution, the first gene (old gene) will be expressed first, while the last gene will often be expressed later. The study also revealed an important new mechanism of human evolution. Scientific research shows that DNA mutation will cause human evolution. There is a kind of DNA fragment called transposon in the DNA sequence. They often jump from one region to another, which will produce DNA mutation. The research results have opened the door to understanding the gene expression regulation of human embryonic development, and will provide a theoretical basis for human eugenics.\n\nThe birth of the world’s first neurological disease model pig promotes the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other diseases\n\nThe picture shows the knock in pig of Huntington’s chorea gene. Source: Popular Science China\n\nAccording to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, after four years of efforts, the international research team led by Guangdong scientists successfully bred the world’s first case of Huntington’s chorea gene knockin pig by using gene editing technology (CRISPR / cas9) and somatic cell nuclear transfer technology for the first time. It can accurately simulate human neurodegenerative diseases, provide stable and reliable animal models for the treatment of Huntington’s chorea, Alzheimer’s disease and other diseases, and promote drug screening and treatment plan formulation. The results were published online in the journal Cell in the early morning of March 30, Beijing time.\n\nAs the world’s first case of Huntington’s disease gene knock into the pig model, the researchers introduced that it will promote the development of the pharmaceutical R & D industrial chain of large animal disease model in China, and promote the R & D process of new drugs for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, as well as immune deficiency, tumor and metabolic diseases. At the same time, the animal model can be used for preclinical evaluation of stem cell therapy and other means, and ultimately benefit mankind.\n\nScientists have discovered more than 100 gene loci that affect human hair color, making it possible for more accurate forensic DNA phenotypic characterization\n\nThe picture is provided by the Chinese Academy of Sciences for hair color classification for genome-wide association analysis\n\nScientists from the Beijing Genomics Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and scientific research institutions in several other countries have newly discovered more than 100 genes that affect human hair color, breaking the previous understanding that human hair color is mainly determined by several known genes, which helps to accurately predict the hair color of unknown criminals through DNA. The research results were published in the international journal Nature Genetics.\n\nPrevious researchers believe that human hair color is mainly determined by several known genes. This study shows that in addition to the known genes, hair color is affected by more than 100 newly discovered genetic loci. Human hair color prediction based on the newly discovered loci has higher accuracy, is conducive to guiding the follow-up study of human complex phenotypic genetics, and provides the possibility for more accurate forensic DNA phenotypic characterization.\n\nChinese scientists first revealed that the atomic resolution image and magic number effect of hydrated ions can shorten the battery charging time and increase the battery power\n\nAfter obtaining the world’s first sub molecular level resolved image of water molecules in 2014, Jiang Ying’s scientific research team, a professor at the quantum material science center of the school of physics of Peking University, obtained the atomic level resolved image of hydrated sodium ions for the first time in the world, and found a magic number effect of hydrated ion transport. The results were published in the international academic journal Nature on May 14.\n\nThe results show that the transport of ions in the confined environment or nanofluids can be controlled by changing the symmetry and periodicity of the surface lattice, so as to selectively enhance or weaken the transport capacity of certain ions, which has important potential significance for many related application fields, such as ion batteries, anti-corrosion, electrochemical reaction, seawater desalination, biological ion channels and so on. “ In addition, the experimental technology of the research exhibition has also pushed the research accuracy of hydration interaction to the atomic level for the first time. It is expected to be applied to more and wider hydrate systems and open up a new research field in the future.\n\nChina has successfully developed the first fully automatic stem cell induction and culture equipment in the world, laying the equipment foundation for regenerative medicine and precision medicine\n\nThe picture is provided by Chinese Academy of Sciences on the operation console of automatic stem cell induction and culture equipment\n\nThe development of the national major scientific research equipment development project “fully automatic stem cell induction and culture equipment” undertaken by Guangzhou Institute of biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, marks the birth of the world’s first intelligent stem cell induction and culture equipment with no one to stick to and deep neural network.\n\nThis device has completely independent intellectual property rights and is established from cell culture", "timestamp": 1653246605, "digest": "RwE_AEMYyyl67t4a_OttaqVVpKiEFB3hiILvGI9Rag0", "contributor": "0x7104f44B7296c82E0b055C354B90B01e04403f04"}

Например A\\*\\* (скриншот выше) может продать вам USDT на 100 рублей, не меньше.\n* Способ оплаты - у торговца должен быть указан такой же способ оплаты, как и добавленный вами в настройки, иначе обмен не получится.\n\nПодобрав нужного торговца нажимайте “Купить USDT” и вводите интересующую вас сумму\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8lGfjY1DkxHleKloBthN1.png?height=496&width=789)\n\nНажимайте кнопку “Купить USDT”, после этого вы попадете в торговый чат, где увидите номер карты торговца, на который нужно отправить рубли.\n\nКогда торговец подтвердит, что получил перевод криптовалюта зачислится на ваш счет.\n\n### Продаем крипту\n\nНа панели сверху выбирайте “Продать”, правее выбирайте крипту, которую хотите продать, например крипто доллар BTC и еще правее местную валюту которую хотите получить, например рубль.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/v1dpLQn2r2F9q90HgGtBi.png?height=582&width=1612)\n\nДалее как и с покупкой выбирайте подходящего торговца, обратите внимание на его лимиты и способ оплаты.\n\nПосле нажатия на кнопку “Продать” введите интересующую вас сумму и еще раз нажимайте “Продать”\n\nПосле этого вы попадете в чат с торговцем, дождитесь, когда на вашу карту придут рубли от торговца и только после этого отправляйте ему криптовалюту нажимая на кнопку “Отправить криптовалюту”.\n\n## Обмен крипты на крипту\n\nДопустим вам прислали оплату в BTC и вы хотите зафиксировать свои средства в более стабильной валюте, например USDT (крипто доллар, привязан к курсу доллара США). Тут все довольно просто:\n\nНа верхней панели выбирайте “Торги” и “Конвертировать”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YHt3gGiTXQUtJFEDtPdE-.png?height=875&width=1882)\n\nОткроется окно, в котором нужно выбрать какую крипту вы отдаете (например BTC) и какую хотите получить (например USDT). Вводите интересующую вас сумму и нажимайте кнопку “Конвертировать”. Данный обмен происходит автоматически, без участия человека с другой стороны.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gnzcz1KSwSiDRkdnlXsMc.png?height=618&width=752)\n\nГотово, вы обменяли биткоин на крипто доллар и теперь можете обменять его на рубли по достаточно стабильному курсу, либо использовать в любых других целях.\n\n## Перевести крипту на биржу\n\nЕсли вы не покупали крипту самостоятельно, а хотите получить перевод от другого человека не ваш счет на бирже, сделать это можно так:\n\nНа верхней панели находите кнопку “Активы” и там нажимайте “Пополнить”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7DBEkXyvgM5_NPINHrrIK.png?height=647&width=1874)\n\nДалее выбирайте интересующую вас валюту и (ОЧЕНЬ ВАЖНО!) сеть, из которой вы будете ее получать. Например биткоин (BTC) можно получить в основной сети BTC-Bitcoin или в сети BTC-Lightning. Уточняйте у отправителя средств как именно он будет это делать и только после этого сообщайте ему адрес для перевода.\n\nВыглядит окно пополнения так:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AQb2ktkyPOKVGNYH0ng4M.png?height=753&width=613)\n\nУвидеть список ваших активов на бирже можно в разделе “Мои активы”, он находится в меню “Активы” на верхней панели. Пополнение можно осуществлять так же из этого раздела.\n\n```\nЕсли материал оказался для вас полезным,\nможете отправить мне пару монет на кофе:\n0x354d4D759c49094f60D537bfD7177c05b70c20cC\n```", "timestamp": 1653247417, "digest": "VCx4yc_PzewAga7ECLmYKQiJq0eNZPsx22VGMPwSy2U", "contributor": "0x354d4D759c49094f60D537bfD7177c05b70c20cC"}
