{"id": "IxxgXO2pjIQXLAfxdY2G794LELmxktXfyySJcL0qBPc", "title": "My Dream for the Planet School", "body": "Last week, I stepped off the *SSV* (Sailing School Vessel) *Corwith Cramer* after spending six weeks at sea as the 3rd Mate for “Marine Biodiversity & Conservation,” a college semester-at-sea program run by the Sea Education Association (SEA)*.* Coming aboard in Key West, Florida seven weeks ago marked 14 years since I had stepped onto *Cramer* as a student myself. I had never been sailing before and I had no idea how profoundly that voyage would impact me. They say that the sea is a great teacher and I agree, but the community we intentionally create at sea deserves description too.\n\nAn isolated ship at sea is, in many ways, an ideal medium for creating deeply impactful learning opportunities. For this inaugural Planet School blog post, I want to share why I love to teach at sea and how the core elements of an ocean-based curriculum do not actually need to be unique to the sea at all. To do that, I need to give a bit of background on what it means to go sailing for a semester on a tall ship.\n\n![Removing the crutch of GPS and navigating with the stars is yet another opportunity for authentic student agency.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2czv-EUWimA9Q8y4l-iNF.jpeg?height=450&width=600)\n\nMake no mistake: sailing is hard work. I suspect that many students, like me when I was 20 years old, perceive a semester aboard a sailboat as one of relaxing exoticism bordering on luxuriousness: perfect sunsets, dolphins chasing the bow, strumming a guitar, reading *Treasure Island* or *Moby Dick* and coming home with a perfect tan and a year’s worth of Instagram posts—no filter, obviously. After all, yachts are a pastime of the wealthy and the Caribbean is a vacation destination. While there are innumerable moments of grandeur to be had at sea and all of the things I listed above usually happen multiple times on every voyage, they belie the full story. Any notion of #YachtLife is a delusion that gets shaken almost instantly.\n\nStudents step onto the ship and they step into a new world. First, the language is completely different—both the immense vocabulary of nautical terminology as well as the style of repeating commands. When you are given a task, you repeat the command back to the person who just gave it to you, then you go do the task, then once the task is done you return to the person who gave you the task and tell them it is complete, which they then repeat back to you. This creates a closed loop—there is little chance for miscommunication—but that much repetition does not come naturally. So not only do students have multiple subject areas to master—navigation, seamanship, meteorology, watch standing duties, laboratory procedures—but their way of communicating is being frequently corrected. They are studying new subjects in a new language in a place that is constantly moving (making many of them seasick) and with a watch-standing schedule that means their sleep is inconsistent. On all fronts, my semester with SEA in college was, hands down, my most challenging term and Brown University was not exactly a cake walk.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wYOcovwOe7n5jeVg9IkIg.jpeg?height=3456&width=4608)\n\n## A Three Phase Approach\n\nEvery voyage program I have sailed on—SEA vessels and Proctor Academy’s Ocean Classroom semester—breaks their trip into three phases: The Spaghetti Phase, The Shadow Phase, and the Junior Watch Officer (JWO) Phase. The Spaghetti Phase is so named because, for the students, it feels like information is being thrown at them like spaghetti: some of it sticks and some (most) just falls to the deck. It could also be called the Firehose Phase because it can feel like drinking from a firehose. Whatever the metaphor, the first phase is characterized by feeling overwhelmed, adjusting to the boat, and being corrected frequently. It can be discouraging, so building unity within a student’s watch is important as is creating frequent moments for light hearted community building. The goal is for students to learn *what* to do and to see this behavior role-modeled by the staff.\n\nThe second phase (usually following two weeks of spaghetti) is when students start to shift to learning *why* things are done. During each watch, a student is selected to be the shadow and follow the mate through their duties. The mate narrates what they are doing as they do it, the student accompanies the mate when they check in with the captain, and the student starts to take the lead in various routines, like making sure the hourly boat checks and weather observations are completed. This is the chance to start peeking behind the curtain and feel invited to partake in the boat’s management.\n\nFinally, the JWO Phase. In many ways, the entire trip builds to the JWO Phase. During this phase, a student is elevated to the position of Junior Watch Officer during their watch and takes over for the mate. Students interact directly with the captain to respond to weather changes, recommend sail evolutions, and delegate tasks within their watch.  The JWO can even delegate tasks to the mate, so long as the task does not take the mate away from the quarterdeck for more than 10 minutes. While the mate is still the safety officer and legally responsible for the watch, they step back as much as possible. Mates are told to let mistakes happen and only yell “Hold!” if a student is about to injure someone or damage the boat. No reason is given for yelling “Hold!”, so action does not resume until the JWO or one of their watchmates discovers the problem and corrects it.\n\n![A JWO, wearing the \"JWO Hat,\" plotting the ship's position.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pw2OQCJQxLevILLX_gG1F.jpeg?height=3024&width=4032)\n\n## A Recipe for Great Learning\n\nThis three phase progression is where the magic happens. All three phases are essential; neither is successful without the other two. Most conventional classrooms never make it past the Spaghetti Phase. Conversely, if we were to skip the Spaghetti Phase, the students would not feel prepared for the greater responsibility asked of them. This progression works because of the learning environment that is very intentionally created by the staff, both in the program’s core design and through staff meetings that happen underway. That environment consists of a few essential ingredients:\n\n1. **Authenticity**. If students feel that their input and time is valued as part of an experience that is not “busy work,” they will invest in it. Since the boat is a real boat sailing on the ocean, everything connected to that objective being completed successfully is very clearly not busy work. There are very real consequences to not doing a job completely or correctly. This element drives home the value of “Seek Excellence.”\n2. **Relevance**. A student could be assigned the authentic task of digging a big hole or meticulously cleaning the interior components of an antique pocket watch but will probably lose interest if the question “why” is not answered. This can sometimes happen with boat checks, which happen every hour on a boat and begin to take on an element of blind routine if their value is not reinforced. When it comes to establishing relevance, the connection can be specific to the student, broad to society, temporal to the moment at hand, or tied to the legacy of the human race 10,000 years from now, but there must be an answer.\n3. **Ownership**. Of all the characteristics here, this is the one we see the most frequently in existing classrooms. High school students are given charge of completing their assignments, showing up to class on time, and discharging a multitude of duties. What I advocate for here is that we create more pathways for the sphere of ownership to keep expanding. We should reward great performance with greater ownership.\n4. **Agency**. This is different from ownership, perhaps even a step up from ownership. Agency combines ownership, relevance, and authenticity to create a moments where the student makes choices that have consequences. As a mate, when I delegate setting a sail to a student, I have given them ownership of that task. Often, the ownership of something means following a script for how that job needs to be done: there is a right way to set a sail and a myriad of wrong ways. Agency means writing the script.\n5. **Ability to Fail**. It is possible to create a learning environment where all of the above are present and yet the lesson still falls short on this final element. A JWO will feel authenticity, relevance, ownership, and agency by the nature of being JWO, but if the mate steps in to answer a tough question or offers an overly revealing hint, the ability to fail dissolves. In some ways, ability to fail creates a deeper layer of fusion between authenticity and the relevance of the experience that generate moments of genuine discomfort for students.\n\n   As a mate, a critical element in creating a successful JWO Phase is to step back and let the student make mistakes, or forget things, or become overwhelmed. This can be hard because I want my students to succeed, but I have come to appreciate that there needs to be a “butterfly emerging from the chrysalis” moment if the value of everything that happened up to that point is going to matter. A student can watch and study something a million times, but then it is their turn to step up and do it. Near the end of the novel *The Alchemist*, the alchemist describes this concept to the protagonist:\n\n> “What you still need to know is this: before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we’ve learned as we’ve moved toward that dream. That’s the point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one ‘dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.’\n>\n> Every search begins with beginner’s luck. And every search ends with the victor’s being severely tested.”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XFo5fuOKYfz2DwkCXIQz_.jpg?height=447&width=450)\n\nTo be clear, I am not talking about fear of failing as a person. Our classrooms already have this trait to a damaging degree with our modern grading system and the pressure of college admissions. I have frequently seen tears on JWO and while sometimes that is just how a person processes stress, there needs to be a calibration of duties with what a student is ready for, which varies by person. When I debrief with my JWO after the watch is over, a pointer I frequently remind them of is to not be too hard on themself when they fail: accept that you will make a mistake, take a moment to reflect on it, and then give yourself the grace to move past it and you can unpack the lesson later. As a leader, you must move past it or you will be distracted from your job in that moment. I also believe that a student needs, ideally, a minimum of three shifts as JWO to enable them to witness their own progress and internalize lessons. Most often, a student’s first JWO stint is not pretty and having that be their one shot would be unfortunate.\n\n## Beyond Sailing\n\nSailing for weeks at a time is an amazing adventure that makes creating many of these conditions easier, but in some ways it is not ideal. The sleep schedule, seasickness, and risk of burnout for staff and students are the most obvious downsides. Sailing is also an expensive and exclusive opportunity. And do we really need a boat in order to do any of this?\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\n![Planet School terms will begin with 4-5 weeks sailing and then transfer to a land campus, bringing along the ethos developed underway.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yh6OSBRAKEr2wfgdma3uE.jpeg?height=3024&width=4032)\n\nMy goal with the Planet School is to take this process that I have seen be so effective on sailboats and replicate it in other realms. A three phase progression carried out between a knowledgeable practitioner and a group of students can be done in almost any field: the leader of a “watch” need not be a professional mariner. The expert could be a farmer, an engineer, an economist, or an artist. The task need not be sailing, it could be starting a business, managing a farm, or building a yurt. It could even be building a school.\n\nThe underlying project of the Planet School is to build the school itself. Since a campus is a community, such an undertaking could reasonably include a project in almost any discipline, giving students the chance to explore their passions and be exposed to potential passions they have not experienced before. Some of my most potent memories from high school are from the activities that included role-playing of “real life”: speech and debate, theatre, Model UN, Youth Legislature, and the school newspaper. Through the prevalence of internships, externships, and youth employment as well as the cliche of how teenagers yearn to leave home, the desire for real world experience at that age is evident. We should build our schools to be authentic laboratories for trying out real world solutions. If we are to be better stewards of our planet, then we need to do more than encourage experimentation, bold thinking, and sustainability—we need to create education spaces where we actively train youth in those habits.\n\nI never imagined myself as a teacher. I never imagined myself working in education. Yet I have learned that any systemic reimagining of human civilization must begin with how we equip our future generations. My vision for school is that, whatever the project, students are challenged in an authentic, relevant way where they have agency, feel ownership, and are trusted to be able to fail.", "timestamp": 1653239582, "digest": "SiaaK_sDxGc1-zoy7KhbTktMsmr-WZmS8dSheqQM8Yc", "contributor": "0x505683cF3aDdF5DE8E82AABB9d24763B9A72aAD0"}

NFT游戏角色简介\n\n### 2.1 雪人Yeti\n\nYeti是游戏最主要的角色，它们可用于开采特定资源，具体取决于Yeti的种族类型和稀有度。 \n\n一共有9种不同的雪人，根据产出的不同可以分为三组类型：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vAsGagFc0aXYodf-AgWKq.png?height=263&width=554)\n\n拿着普通斧头、高级斧头，手拿普通锯子的雪人开采木头资源，每次开采需消耗能量和工具耐久度，耐久度可通过矿石代币修复。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5YSw19O1fsamU1y-TtNol.png?height=271&width=554)\n\n带电锯、普通镐和电钻的雪人开采矿石资源(millirium)，每次开采需消耗能量和工具耐久度，耐久度通过木头代币修复。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3MYMR2ANfzZv_wLaqA5v2.png?height=265&width=554)\n\n初学、中级和高级的雪人工程师是可再生能源生产的先驱，它们产出能量，每次开采仅消耗耐久，耐久需要通过矿石和木头来修复。\n\n### 2.2 护身符Amulet\n\n游戏中目前有6种不同的护身符，可以用于增加每次开采的资源数量，或减少每次开采所需要消耗的数量，同时将护身符放置到祭坛还可以产出一些spirit代币。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9nw67oE3IxfpdMcVCDmQ-.png?height=282&width=312)\n\n护身符除了可从atomichub交易市场购买，还可以使用木头、矿石和精神三种代币来制作。\n\n### 2.3 魔法砖magicbrick\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-epA4k2iHzHWgbxPy2aR1.png?height=346&width=430)\n\n小屋(cabin)是雪人们居住的建筑物，游戏初始为每个玩家提供了两间小屋，初始每间小屋仅可容纳一个同一类型的雪人，也就是如果你有两个工程师雪人NFT用于挖能量代币，可将它们分别放置到两个小屋中，但如果有第三个同样用于挖掘能量的雪人，就需要使用魔法砖来升级你的小屋。 \n\n蓝色和绿色魔法砖可用于增加小屋容量，普通cabin升级到大型cabin需要3块蓝色魔法砖或1块绿色魔法砖，大型升级到别墅需要6块蓝色魔法砖或2块绿砖，一个玩家最多可在游戏内放置18只不同类型的雪人。 \n\n粉色和紫色魔法砖则可用于增加使用护身符的插槽。\n\n \n\n### 2.4 土地land\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/B9wzz_HQZRDqr-7hphMyv.png?height=320&width=554)\n\n玩家除了挖掘资源，也可以选择持有一块或多块土地，每块土地有不同的开采类型和稀有度，土地所有者可从其他玩家在该土地上开采的资源中获得 2% 到 8% 的分润收益。 \n\n注意目前土地还未开始销售，另外如上图所示，在页面中心的阿曼达岛屿附近有六块大型岛屿(megaland)，官方后期将会举行拍卖会，它们每一块是普通土地面积的7倍，且该土地的所有者将和传奇土地所有者平分系统总佣金池的40%。\n\n \n\n## 3. 玩法流程 \n\n在对经济模型和游戏角色有个基础了解后，让我们来看看雪人家族的具体玩法： \n\n**进入游戏网站自动连接钱包：**\n\n[https://saar.game/](https://saar.game/)\n\n**第一次登录首先会看到资源选择页面：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vdC2xqfZ1zS57DBucooNs.png?height=329&width=554)\n\n根据你持有的雪人类型选择其中一种资源类型来采挖，玩家在同一时间段只能开采木头、矿石、能源这三种中的其中一种，如果你选择开采能源，而账号中还有挖掘木头的雪人，那它将只能产出spirit代币(无需消耗能量)。 \n\n玩家可自由切换采挖资源类型，但需要支付相应的代币，比如从挖能源切换到挖木头，需支付500个srw币。 \n\n**选择土地：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yIYHEJHdvNmdviTTCuKUe.png?height=287&width=554)\n\n土地可以选megaland或是周围的普通土地都可以，只要点击每块土地看到左侧详细信息里显示有choose for mining即可选择，土地选择需注意，如果是普通地，land type要选择和你主挖的资源一致的地，另外天气尽量选当前是sunny的，如果是其他天气类型会影响产出。\n\n \n\n**选好后在页面右下角点击Village进入游戏页面如下图所示：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4cCnUWahZUSIGs44sUNhq.png?height=308&width=554)\n\n**点击小屋，进入采挖页面：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6K5wHYo_jd99wwTM7YL82.png?height=316&width=554)\n\n根据你的雪人类型在右侧分栏选择合适的插槽放置NFT，放置好后如无显示刷新页面即可。\n\n**雪人放置好后即可开始采挖：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fFmRVQoPILIRN_7MqqIqN.png?height=320&width=554)\n\n上图是普通能量开采工程师的采挖页面，每1小时claim一次，一次大约可获得45.45个能量代币，消耗60个耐久度，需要12个矿石和18个木头代币来修复，这里玩家可选择每次去repair，也可以积累到耐久度用完。 \n\n另如果是挖木头或矿石，采挖时需要消耗能量，因此要事先充入一些能量代币到游戏中。 \n\n以上就是雪人家族大致的流程，目前claim间隔默认是1小时，每支付5个spirit币可将claim间隔时间延长1小时。 \n\n**收益方面团队暂时没有给官方的ROI表，这里附上一份社区玩家做的表格：**\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iOYDIqOca5KLEZB3QS6Eqs5TblaK0oE9dB2VnXgCGzs/edit#gid=2079524431](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iOYDIqOca5KLEZB3QS6Eqs5TblaK0oE9dB2VnXgCGzs/edit#gid=2079524431)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XuB9ij_hikVtKoIYzx9pR.png?height=251&width=554)\n\n可以填入你想配置的NFT，参考下大致的ROI，但需要注意，游戏内数据是动态变化的，它这里记录的消耗产出和实际存在出入，同时没有考虑手续费和精神代币的产出，所以它只是暂时的参考，从目前观察来看，产出矿石和能量的ROI比木头要好，同时等级越高的收益越高，不考虑价格波动，史诗传奇的ROI平均在10天上下，相对普通的在30天以上。\n\n## 4. 项目测评及潜力分析\n\nSAAR雪人家族是比较典型的多币制挖矿游戏，这也是目前市场主流的一种经济模型，玩家可选择不同的玩法策略，token之间互为供需，可使游戏维持更长期的经济平衡。 \n\n相对于市场同类项目，SAAR的主要亮点一是通过第四种代币sws的消耗，来延长claim时间间隔，达到一定程度的自动化采挖，从同类项目来看，这种设计是有一定玩家需求的。 \n\n另一个是天气状况的设计，每块土地每24小时都可能会有不同的天气变化，Sunny太阳天不会对玩家有任何影响，Windy阴天，有30%概率产生，它会减少Yeti15%的产出量，有10%的几率遇到Snowstorm暴风雪天，在这种天气条件下，开采量减少50%，同时消耗量翻倍，对于普通NFT，这时玩家可能需要选择停工。 \n\n天气的变量增加了游戏的随机性，同时也有助于对游戏内各种资源供需进行动态调整，通过对近年来链游市场的观察，我们也发现，经济模式不只是写在白皮书和表格里的单一数据，随着游戏的发展，能进行有效的动态调节对项目的长期很重要。 \n\n问题方面目前来说可能最主要的还是市场偏小众，据Dappradar数据，日活用户数在500左右，这里主要原因可能在于随着加密市场进入熊市，链游市场一直萎靡不振，特别是近期wax价格大幅下跌，也导致很多玩家离场，另外该项目从销售到上线的时间间隔稍长，现在也会存在一点热度缺失，包括NFT市场交易量暂时不高，还需要看团队在未来是否能够通过一些营销或市场活动激发更多玩家的兴趣。 \n\n不过市场趋冷对玩家来说不一定是坏事，像现在市场上的入门包也就在10-30刀不等，风险可控，所以它还是比较适合一些喜欢玩这种采挖游戏的玩家去体验。 \n\n对于未来的关注点一是制作合成，从NFT市场来看，他家各类型的雪人体量并不是特别大，早期包八九成也都被打开，随着用户增长，有望刺激合成需求，合成消耗更多的代币，代币价值增长再推动更多的用户增长，这也是这种挖矿合成类主要的增长模式。 \n\n另一个就是土地，目前官方还未公布销售规则，对玩家来说，它可能也是该游戏接下来的一个机会点。\n\n## 相关链接\n\n`官推：`\n\n[https://twitter.com/SaaR_nft](https://twitter.com/SaaR_nft)\n\n`白皮书：`\n\n[https://whitepaper.saar.network/](https://whitepaper.saar.network/)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653239757, "digest": "MIbMrEPFslnl04gAUayyZ2CpW313s_6GVvk6md56GEI", "contributor": "0xeF96650E66688D5Fedb995432E28cdadDCcCBF71"}

With that in mind, we’ve decided to do things a little differently and base our launch on (possibly) the rarest commodity in this market: awareness. Welcome to our stealth launch.\n\n\n---\n\n*The ASX Genesis Event has arrived.

There's no vesting. 100% of the max supply will be unlocked and circulating on day one.\n* Once the soft cap is reached (250,000,000 ASX minted), a countdown of 10 days will start. When it hits zero, the Genesis Event will end, the initial liquidity pool on Uniswap will be created and the remaining ASX will be burned along with the liquidity provider (LP) token.\n* ASX ERC-20 smart contract address: **0x5313235002b9F11698D7B9187Be44f836FEbD6b5**.\n\n\n---\n\n## A unique token launch\n\nAs a community-focused project committed to the ethos and founding principles of the blockchain space, we are pleased to announce the official launch of **ASX**, the governance token of the ASX Protocol.\n\nIn the spirit of equal distribution, fairness, decentralization, and a community-first ideology, the launch event is taking place on our [custom-made platform](https://mint.asx.st/) and it's the first and only opportunity for anyone to get access to the ASX Protocol's native token, **ASX**, which will give holders the power to govern and curate essential infrastructure components of the network.\n\nOur mission is to give everyone in our community an opportunity to become a stakeholder in the ecosystem, and we want to extend that opportunity as fairly as possible. Launching ASX on our own platform, with a mechanism that is fair and transparent for all participants, drastically increases the chances of achieving this mission.\n\nApart from building our own token launch platform, we made sure everyone was on a level playing field. There's no seed or private sale, no liquidity mining, no emission (zero inflation), zero tokens to influencers or promoters, no airdrop, and zero Treasury, Company, Founders, Team, or Partners allocation.\n\n### 1 billion ASX tokens. 800 million to be minted, 200 million for liquidity. That's it.\n\n> *The protocol's revenue will exclusively serve ASX holders and all operations will be funded with ETH or stablecoins.*\n\nThe ASX Genesis Event is open to all interested and qualifying parties. It's a major milestone for the ASX Protocol ecosystem and speaks to the viability of our core technology and business model as we aim to become the ultimate permissionless omnichain liquidity hub for staked assets.\n\nAt ASX Labs, we believe in creating a global staking ecosystem of the people, by the people, for the people, that shall not perish under any threats. The crypto dream has never been about creating an instrument that can easily be put in a box, but about creating global assets that can govern and manage these new decentralized global networks.\n\n## Understanding the mechanics\n\nTo mint 1 ASX you need to contribute 0.000004 ETH. A total of 800,000,000 ASX will be available for minting. Due to the low fully diluted market cap of the project and to ensure as broad a distribution as possible and dramatically soften the potential for a massive gas war, we decided to operate in stealth mode until 50% of the tokens are minted.\n\nThere's a minimum of 1 ASX per mint and no maximum. Setting up a max cap per wallet without KYC is foolish and we're not big fans of KYC in DeFi. For us, privacy and freedom are paramount, and we respect and stand by yours. With that said, there's a cap of 100 ETH per mint on our Interface just to slow things down, if they get a bit crazy.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to hear about the ASX Protocol early, you'll have enough time to participate. Otherwise, you can get ASX tokens on Uniswap, after the Genesis Event is completed.\n\n## How to participate\n\nParticipating in the ASX Genesis Event is simple, quick, and intuitive, and getting prepared is even easier. Here’s what you’ll need:\n\n→ **An Ethereum-compatible web3 browser wallet**, such as MetaMask. You can generate a wallet address from these web3 wallets directly, or use your seeds to import an existing wallet address.\n\n→ **Sufficient ETH**, which you will need in order to contribute and pay for transactions gas fees.\n\nOnce you’ve got your checklist all set, here’s what the process will look like:\n\n1. To get started, head to our custom-made [Launch Platform](https://mint.asx.st/).\n2. You’ll be prompted with a welcome message. Click on \"**PARTICIPATION TERMS**\". Read everything and, if you agree, click on \"**I AGREE**\". Next, click on \"**CONTINUE**\".\n3. The next message will be a TL;DR of the ASX Genesis Event. Carefully read everything and click on \"**CONTINUE**\".\n4. You can now connect your wallet. We support almost any web3 injected wallet, but for a flawless experience, we recommend using MetaMask. Click on \"**CONNECT WALLET**\", either in the center or on the upper right-hand corner of the page.\n5. Once your wallet is connected, the ETH and ASX input fields will become available to you. You may either insert the amount of ASX you would like to receive or the amount of ETH you would like to contribute. Enter the desired amount and click on \"**MINT**\". Please make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet to pay for transaction fees.\n6. You will see a popup from your MetaMask wallet. Confirm the transaction and then wait for it to go through. Once it is validated on the Ethereum blockchain, your ASX balance, on the top of the page, will update and a \"CLAIM\" button will appear. You will be able to claim your ASX tokens once the event is completed.\n7. That's it! You successfully participated in the ASX Genesis Event.\n\n*Once your transaction is validated, a smart contract, that works like an escrow, will receive your ASX tokens and keep them safe until the end of the Genesis Event, when you will be able to claim them. Claimed ASX tokens are not locked and there is no vesting.*\n\n*Team and partners are allowed to participate in the Genesis Event after the progress bar reaches 50%. If the desired amount of ASX that those parties intend to hold can't be fully minted during this event, the remaining amount will be purchased on Uniswap.*\n\n## Liquidity\n\nBy the end of the Genesis Event, the initial liquidity of the ASX token will be immediately provided as a full range position on Uniswap V3. Since the resulting liquidity provider (LP) token will be directly burned, this initial position will be perpetual.\n\nThe liquidity depth will represent 40% of the FDV (Fully Diluted Value) and its absolute value will be based on the total ASX minted.\n\n* At soft cap, 250 ETH will be paired with 62,500,000 ASX, pricing the token at $0.0077 / ASX with $962,500 of liquidity depth.\n* At hard cap, 800 ETH will be paired with 200,000,000 ASX, pricing the token at $0.0077 / ASX with $3,080,000 of liquidity depth.\n\n*The Genesis Event will end in 10 days after the soft cap is reached or when all ASX tokens are minted, whichever comes first. Any unminted ASX will be burned.*\n\n## Security\n\nWe were very careful when deciding the code for the ASX ERC-20 smart contract and, to make it the safest possible, we only allowed the absolutely necessary lines of code. There's no mint function, no pause function and the contract is not upgradeable. It is an immutable token on the Ethereum Mainnet Network.\n\nBoth the ERC-20 and the Genesis Event smart contracts were developed with the highest levels of security, leveraging the battle-tested OpenZeppelin standard. With the entire supply circulating by the end of the Genesis Event plus the immediate burn of the liquidity provider (LP) token, you can rest assured that the ASX token can never be hacked or rugged.\n\n### Important Notes\n\nThe team at ASX Labs will NEVER DM YOU FIRST or ask you for money on any platform. You should be very skeptical of any DMs received by anyone claiming to be from ASX Labs.\n\nOnly trust ASX Protocol's official channels at the bottom of this announcement for information surrounding the event.\n\nThe ASX token will only be available once the Genesis Event is completed. Only then you will be able to trade it on Uniswap. Be sure to always check the smart contract address before trading.\n\n\n---\n\nThis is the first step towards an omnichain yield future.

With that in mind, we’ve decided to do things a little differently and base our launch on (possibly) the rarest commodity in this market: awareness. Welcome to our stealth launch.\n\n\n---\n\n*The ASX Genesis Event has arrived. Please read this article carefully to understand the novel mechanics of this event.*\n\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\n*Values in US$ consider ETH priced at $1,925.*\n\n* **Token:** ASX (ERC-20) → Governance Token of the ASX Protocol\n* **Network:** Ethereum Mainnet\n* **Total / Max Supply:** 1,000,000,000 ASX\n* **Genesis Event Allocation:** 800,000,000 ASX\n* **Initial Liquidity Allocation:** 200,000,000 ASX\n* **Mint Rate:** 1 ASX / 0.000004 ETH or 250,000 ASX / 1 ETH\n* **Venue:** Self-hosted at <https://mint.asx.st/>\n* **Mode:** First-come, first-served basis (FCFS)\n* **Start date**: Live now\n* **End date**: 10 days after the soft cap is reached\n* **Soft Cap:** 1000 ETH | 250,000,000 ASX minted\n* **Hard Cap:** 3200 ETH | 800,000,000 ASX minted\n* **Fully Diluted Market Cap / Value (FDV)**\n  * **at Soft Cap:** 312,500,000 ASX \\~ $2,406,250 | 687,500,000 ASX burned\n  * **at Hard Cap:** 1,000,000,000 ASX \\~ $7,700,000 | 0 ASX burned\n* **Initial Liquidity (40% of FDV)**\n  * **at Soft Cap:** 62,500,000 ASX + 250 ETH | \\~ $962,500\n  * **at Hard Cap:** 200,000,000 ASX + 800 ETH | \\~ $3,080,000\n* There's no founders or team allocation, no seed or private sale, no liquidity mining, and no airdrop. The Genesis Event is the first and only place to get ASX tokens before listing.\n* Team and partners are allowed to participate after the progress bar reaches 50%.\n* Participants can claim their ASX tokens once the event is completed. There's no vesting. 100% of the max supply will be unlocked and circulating on day one.\n* Once the soft cap is reached (250,000,000 ASX minted), a countdown of 10 days will start. When it hits zero, the Genesis Event will end, the initial liquidity pool on Uniswap will be created and the remaining ASX will be burned along with the liquidity provider (LP) token.\n* ASX ERC-20 smart contract address: **0x5313235002b9F11698D7B9187Be44f836FEbD6b5**.\n\n\n---\n\n## A unique token launch\n\nAs a community-focused project committed to the ethos and founding principles of the blockchain space, we are pleased to announce the official launch of **ASX**, the governance token of the ASX Protocol.\n\nIn the spirit of equal distribution, fairness, decentralization, and a community-first ideology, the launch event is taking place on our [custom-made platform](https://mint.asx.st/) and it's the first and only opportunity for anyone to get access to the ASX Protocol's native token, **ASX**, which will give holders the power to govern and curate essential infrastructure components of the network.\n\nOur mission is to give everyone in our community an opportunity to become a stakeholder in the ecosystem, and we want to extend that opportunity as fairly as possible. Launching ASX on our own platform, with a mechanism that is fair and transparent for all participants, drastically increases the chances of achieving this mission.\n\nApart from building our own token launch platform, we made sure everyone was on a level playing field. There's no seed or private sale, no liquidity mining, no emission (zero inflation), zero tokens to influencers or promoters, no airdrop, and zero Treasury, Company, Founders, Team, or Partners allocation.\n\n### 1 billion ASX tokens. 800 million to be minted, 200 million for liquidity. That's it.\n\n> ***The protocol's revenue will exclusively serve ASX holders and all operations will be funded with ETH or stablecoins.***\n\nThe ASX Genesis Event is open to all interested and qualifying parties. It's a major milestone for the ASX Protocol ecosystem and speaks to the viability of our core technology and business model as we aim to become the ultimate permissionless omnichain liquidity hub for staked assets.\n\nAt ASX Labs, we believe in creating a global staking ecosystem of the people, by the people, for the people, that shall not perish under any threats. The crypto dream has never been about creating an instrument that can easily be put in a box, but about creating global assets that can govern and manage these new decentralized global networks.\n\n## Understanding the mechanics\n\nTo mint 1 ASX you need to contribute 0.000004 ETH. A total of 800,000,000 ASX will be available for minting. Due to the low fully diluted market cap of the project and to ensure as broad a distribution as possible and dramatically soften the potential for a massive gas war, we decided to operate in stealth mode until 50% of the tokens are minted.\n\nThere's a minimum of 1 ASX per mint and no maximum.

I had never been sailing before and I had no idea how profoundly that voyage would impact me. They say that the sea is a great teacher and I agree, but the community we intentionally create at sea deserves description too.\n\nAn isolated ship at sea is, in many ways, an ideal medium for creating deeply impactful learning opportunities. For this inaugural Planet School blog post, I want to share why I love to teach at sea and how the core elements of an ocean-based curriculum do not actually need to be unique to the sea at all. To do that, I need to give a bit of background on what it means to go sailing for a semester on a tall ship.\n\n![Removing the crutch of GPS and navigating with the stars is yet another opportunity for authentic student agency.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2czv-EUWimA9Q8y4l-iNF.jpeg?height=450&width=600)\n\nMake no mistake: sailing is hard work. I suspect that many students, like me when I was 20 years old, perceive a semester aboard a sailboat as one of relaxing exoticism bordering on luxuriousness: perfect sunsets, dolphins chasing the bow, strumming a guitar, reading *Treasure Island* or *Moby Dick* and coming home with a perfect tan and a year’s worth of Instagram posts—no filter, obviously. After all, yachts are a pastime of the wealthy and the Caribbean is a vacation destination. While there are innumerable moments of grandeur to be had at sea and all of the things I listed above usually happen multiple times on every voyage, they belie the full story. Any notion of #YachtLife is a delusion that gets shaken almost instantly.\n\nStudents step onto the ship and they step into a new world. First, the language is completely different—both the immense vocabulary of nautical terminology as well as the style of repeating commands. When you are given a task, you repeat the command back to the person who just gave it to you, then you go do the task, then once the task is done you return to the person who gave you the task and tell them it is complete, which they then repeat back to you. This creates a closed loop—there is little chance for miscommunication—but that much repetition does not come naturally. So not only do students have multiple subject areas to master—navigation, seamanship, meteorology, watch standing duties, laboratory procedures—but their way of communicating is being frequently corrected. They are studying new subjects in a new language in a place that is constantly moving (making many of them seasick) and with a watch-standing schedule that means their sleep is inconsistent. On all fronts, my semester with SEA in college was, hands down, my most challenging term and Brown University was not exactly a cake walk.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wYOcovwOe7n5jeVg9IkIg.jpeg?height=3456&width=4608)\n\n## A Three Phase Approach\n\nEvery voyage program I have sailed on—SEA vessels and Proctor Academy’s Ocean Classroom semester—breaks their trip into three phases: The Spaghetti Phase, The Shadow Phase, and the Junior Watch Officer (JWO) Phase. The Spaghetti Phase is so named because, for the students, it feels like information is being thrown at them like spaghetti: some of it sticks and some (most) just falls to the deck. It could also be called the Firehose Phase because it can feel like drinking from a firehose. Whatever the metaphor, the first phase is characterized by feeling overwhelmed, adjusting to the boat, and being corrected frequently. It can be discouraging, so building unity within a student’s watch is important as is creating frequent moments for light hearted community building. The goal is for students to learn *what* to do and to see this behavior role-modeled by the staff.\n\nThe second phase (usually following two weeks of spaghetti) is when students start to shift to learning *why* things are done. During each watch, a student is selected to be the shadow and follow the mate through their duties. The mate narrates what they are doing as they do it, the student accompanies the mate when they check in with the captain, and the student starts to take the lead in various routines, like making sure the hourly boat checks and weather observations are completed. This is the chance to start peeking behind the curtain and feel invited to partake in the boat’s management.\n\nFinally, the JWO Phase. In many ways, the entire trip builds to the JWO Phase. During this phase, a student is elevated to the position of Junior Watch Officer during their watch and takes over for the mate. Students interact directly with the captain to respond to weather changes, recommend sail evolutions, and delegate tasks within their watch.  The JWO can even delegate tasks to the mate, so long as the task does not take the mate away from the quarterdeck for more than 10 minutes. While the mate is still the safety officer and legally responsible for the watch, they step back as much as possible. Mates are told to let mistakes happen and only yell “Hold!” if a student is about to injure someone or damage the boat. No reason is given for yelling “Hold!”, so action does not resume until the JWO or one of their watchmates discovers the problem and corrects it.\n\n![A JWO, wearing the \"JWO Hat,\" plotting the ship's position.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pw2OQCJQxLevILLX_gG1F.jpeg?height=3024&width=4032)\n\n## A Recipe for Great Learning\n\nThis three phase progression is where the magic happens. All three phases are essential; neither is successful without the other two. Most conventional classrooms never make it past the Spaghetti Phase. Conversely, if we were to skip the Spaghetti Phase, the students would not feel prepared for the greater responsibility asked of them. This progression works because of the learning environment that is very intentionally created by the staff, both in the program’s core design and through staff meetings that happen underway. That environment consists of a few essential ingredients:\n\n1. **Authenticity**. If students feel that their input and time is valued as part of an experience that is not “busy work,” they will invest in it. Since the boat is a real boat sailing on the ocean, everything connected to that objective being completed successfully is very clearly not busy work. There are very real consequences to not doing a job completely or correctly. This element drives home the value of “Seek Excellence.”\n2. **Relevance**. A student could be assigned the authentic task of digging a big hole or meticulously cleaning the interior components of an antique pocket watch but will probably lose interest if the question “why” is not answered. This can sometimes happen with boat checks, which happen every hour on a boat and begin to take on an element of blind routine if their value is not reinforced. When it comes to establishing relevance, the connection can be specific to the student, broad to society, temporal to the moment at hand, or tied to the legacy of the human race 10,000 years from now, but there must be an answer.\n3. **Ownership**. Of all the characteristics here, this is the one we see the most frequently in existing classrooms. High school students are given charge of completing their assignments, showing up to class on time, and discharging a multitude of duties. What I advocate for here is that we create more pathways for the sphere of ownership to keep expanding. We should reward great performance with greater ownership.\n4. **Agency**. This is different from ownership, perhaps even a step up from ownership. Agency combines ownership, relevance, and authenticity to create a moments where the student makes choices that have consequences. As a mate, when I delegate setting a sail to a student, I have given them ownership of that task. Often, the ownership of something means following a script for how that job needs to be done: there is a right way to set a sail and a myriad of wrong ways. Agency means writing the script.\n5. **Ability to Fail**. It is possible to create a learning environment where all of the above are present and yet the lesson still falls short on this final element. A JWO will feel authenticity, relevance, ownership, and agency by the nature of being JWO, but if the mate steps in to answer a tough question or offers an overly revealing hint, the ability to fail dissolves. In some ways, ability to fail creates a deeper layer of fusion between authenticity and the relevance of the experience that generate moments of genuine discomfort for students.\n\n   As a mate, a critical element in creating a successful JWO Phase is to step back and let the student make mistakes, or forget things, or become overwhelmed. This can be hard because I want my students to succeed, but I have come to appreciate that there needs to be a “butterfly emerging from the chrysalis” moment if the value of everything that happened up to that point is going to matter. A student can watch and study something a million times, but then it is their turn to step up and do it. Near the end of the novel *The Alchemist*, the alchemist describes this concept to the protagonist:\n\n> “What you still need to know is this: before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we’ve learned as we’ve moved toward that dream. That’s the point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one ‘dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.’\n>\n> Every search begins with beginner’s luck. And every search ends with the victor’s being severely tested.”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XFo5fuOKYfz2DwkCXIQz_.jpg?height=447&width=450)\n\nTo be clear, I am not talking about fear of failing as a person. Our classrooms already have this trait to a damaging degree with our modern grading system and the pressure of college admissions. I have frequently seen tears on JWO and while sometimes that is just how a person processes stress, there needs to be a calibration of duties with what a student is ready for, which varies by person. When I debrief with my JWO after the watch is over, a pointer I frequently remind them of is to not be too hard on themself when they fail: accept that you will make a mistake, take a moment to reflect on it, and then give yourself the grace to move past it and you can unpack the lesson later. As a leader, you must move past it or you will be distracted from your job in that moment. I also believe that a student needs, ideally, a minimum of three shifts as JWO to enable them to witness their own progress and internalize lessons. Most often, a student’s first JWO stint is not pretty and having that be their one shot would be unfortunate.\n\n## Beyond Sailing\n\nSailing for weeks at a time is an amazing adventure that makes creating many of these conditions easier, but in some ways it is not ideal. The sleep schedule, seasickness, and risk of burnout for staff and students are the most obvious downsides. Sailing is also an expensive and exclusive opportunity. And do we really need a boat in order to do any of this?\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\n![Planet School terms will begin with 4-5 weeks sailing and then transfer to a land campus, bringing along the ethos developed underway.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yh6OSBRAKEr2wfgdma3uE.jpeg?height=3024&width=4032)\n\nMy goal with the Planet School is to take this process that I have seen be so effective on sailboats and replicate it in other realms. A three phase progression carried out between a knowledgeable practitioner and a group of students can be done in almost any field: the leader of a “watch” need not be a professional mariner. The expert could be a farmer, an engineer, an economist, or an artist. The task need not be sailing, it could be starting a business, managing a farm, or building a yurt. It could even be building a school.\n\nThe underlying project of the Planet School is to build the school itself. Since a campus is a community, such an undertaking could reasonably include a project in almost any discipline, giving students the chance to explore their passions and be exposed to potential passions they have not experienced before. Some of my most potent memories from high school are from the activities that included role-playing of “real life”: speech and debate, theatre, Model UN, Youth Legislature, and the school newspaper. Through the prevalence of internships, externships, and youth employment as well as the cliche of how teenagers yearn to leave home, the desire for real world experience at that age is evident. We should build our schools to be authentic laboratories for trying out real world solutions. If we are to be better stewards of our planet, then we need to do more than encourage experimentation, bold thinking, and sustainability—we need to create education spaces where we actively train youth in those habits.\n\nI never imagined myself as a teacher. I never imagined myself working in education. Yet I have learned that any systemic reimagining of human civilization must begin with how we equip our future generations. My vision for school is that, whatever the project, students are challenged in an authentic, relevant way where they have agency, feel ownership, and are trusted to be able to fail.", "timestamp": 1653240036, "digest": "SiaaK_sDxGc1-zoy7KhbTktMsmr-WZmS8dSheqQM8Yc", "contributor": "0x505683cF3aDdF5DE8E82AABB9d24763B9A72aAD0"}

{"id": "l5UF_vuCanTR12l4OciB1z_OMSvMAAg9N3f18-Up1N4", "title": "ASX Genesis Event", "body": "## Not you usual TGE\n\nThere have been many debates about what the fairest token generation event mechanism would be, but a consensus has yet to be reached. With that in mind, we’ve decided to do things a little differently and base our launch on (possibly) the rarest commodity in this market: awareness. Welcome to our stealth launch.\n\n\n---\n\n*The ASX Genesis Event has arrived. Please read this article carefully to understand the novel mechanics of this event.*\n\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\n*Values in US$ consider ETH priced at $1,925.*\n\n* **Token:** ASX (ERC-20) → Governance Token of the ASX Protocol\n* **Network:** Ethereum Mainnet\n* **Total / Max Supply:** 1,000,000,000 ASX\n* **Genesis Event Allocation:** 800,000,000 ASX\n* **Initial Liquidity Allocation:** 200,000,000 ASX\n* **Mint Rate:** 1 ASX / 0.000004 ETH or 250,000 ASX / 1 ETH\n* **Venue:** Self-hosted at <https://mint.asx.st/>\n* **Mode:** First-come, first-served basis (FCFS)\n* **Start date**: Live now\n* **End date**: 10 days after the soft cap is reached\n* **Soft Cap:** 1000 ETH | 250,000,000 ASX minted\n* **Hard Cap:** 3200 ETH | 800,000,000 ASX minted\n* **Fully Diluted Market Cap / Value (FDV)**\n  * **at Soft Cap:** 312,500,000 ASX \\~ $2,406,250 | 687,500,000 ASX burned\n  * **at Hard Cap:** 1,000,000,000 ASX \\~ $7,700,000 | 0 ASX burned\n* **Initial Liquidity (40% of FDV)**\n  * **at Soft Cap:** 62,500,000 ASX + 250 ETH | \\~ $962,500\n  * **at Hard Cap:** 200,000,000 ASX + 800 ETH | \\~ $3,080,000\n* There's no founders or team allocation, no seed or private sale, no liquidity mining, and no airdrop. The Genesis Event is the first and only place to get ASX tokens before listing.\n* Team and partners are allowed to participate after the progress bar reaches 50%.\n* Participants can claim their ASX tokens once the event is completed. There's no vesting. 100% of the max supply will be unlocked and circulating on day one.\n* Once the soft cap is reached (250,000,000 ASX minted), a countdown of 10 days will start. When it hits zero, the Genesis Event will end, the initial liquidity pool on Uniswap will be created and the remaining ASX will be burned along with the liquidity provider (LP) token.\n* ASX ERC-20 smart contract address: **0x5313235002b9F11698D7B9187Be44f836FEbD6b5**.\n\n\n---\n\n## A unique token launch\n\nAs a community-focused project committed to the ethos and founding principles of the blockchain space, we are pleased to announce the official launch of **ASX**, the governance token of the ASX Protocol.\n\nIn the spirit of equal distribution, fairness, decentralization, and a community-first ideology, the launch event is taking place on our [custom-made platform](https://mint.asx.st/) and it's the first and only opportunity for anyone to get access to the ASX Protocol's native token, **ASX**, which will give holders the power to govern and curate essential infrastructure components of the network.\n\nOur mission is to give everyone in our community an opportunity to become a stakeholder in the ecosystem, and we want to extend that opportunity as fairly as possible. Launching ASX on our own platform, with a mechanism that is fair and transparent for all participants, drastically increases the chances of achieving this mission.\n\nApart from building our own token launch platform, we made sure everyone was on a level playing field. There's no seed or private sale, no liquidity mining, no emission (zero inflation), zero tokens to influencers or promoters, no airdrop, and zero Treasury, Company, Founders, Team, or Partners allocation.\n\n### 1 billion ASX tokens. 800 million to be minted, 200 million for liquidity. That's it.\n\n> *The protocol's revenue will exclusively serve ASX holders and all operations will be funded with ETH or stablecoins.*\n\nThe ASX Genesis Event is open to all interested and qualifying parties. It's a major milestone for the ASX Protocol ecosystem and speaks to the viability of our core technology and business model as we aim to become the ultimate permissionless omnichain liquidity hub for staked assets.\n\nAt ASX Labs, we believe in creating a global staking ecosystem of the people, by the people, for the people, that shall not perish under any threats. The crypto dream has never been about creating an instrument that can easily be put in a box, but about creating global assets that can govern and manage these new decentralized global networks.\n\n## Understanding the mechanics\n\nTo mint 1 ASX you need to contribute 0.000004 ETH. A total of 800,000,000 ASX will be available for minting. Due to the low fully diluted market cap of the project and to ensure as broad a distribution as possible and dramatically soften the potential for a massive gas war, we decided to operate in stealth mode until 50% of the tokens are minted.\n\nThere's a minimum of 1 ASX per mint and no maximum. Setting up a max cap per wallet without KYC is foolish and we're not big fans of KYC in DeFi. For us, privacy and freedom are paramount, and we respect and stand by yours. With that said, there's a cap of 100 ETH per mint on our Interface just to slow things down, if they get a bit crazy.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to hear about the ASX Protocol early, you'll have enough time to participate. Otherwise, you can get ASX tokens on Uniswap, after the Genesis Event is completed.\n\n## How to participate\n\nParticipating in the ASX Genesis Event is simple, quick, and intuitive, and getting prepared is even easier. Here’s what you’ll need:\n\n→ **An Ethereum-compatible web3 browser wallet**, such as MetaMask. You can generate a wallet address from these web3 wallets directly, or use your seeds to import an existing wallet address.\n\n→ **Sufficient ETH**, which you will need in order to contribute and pay for transactions gas fees.\n\nOnce you’ve got your checklist all set, here’s what the process will look like:\n\n1. To get started, head to our custom-made [Launch Platform](https://mint.asx.st/).\n2. You’ll be prompted with a welcome message. Click on \"**PARTICIPATION TERMS**\". Read everything and, if you agree, click on \"**I AGREE**\". Next, click on \"**CONTINUE**\".\n3. The next message will be a TL;DR of the ASX Genesis Event. Carefully read everything and click on \"**CONTINUE**\".\n4. You can now connect your wallet. We support almost any web3 injected wallet, but for a flawless experience, we recommend using MetaMask. Click on \"**CONNECT WALLET**\", either in the center or on the upper right-hand corner of the page.\n5. Once your wallet is connected, the ETH and ASX input fields will become available to you. You may either insert the amount of ASX you would like to receive or the amount of ETH you would like to contribute. Enter the desired amount and click on \"**MINT**\". Please make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet to pay for transaction fees.\n6. You will see a popup from your MetaMask wallet. Confirm the transaction and then wait for it to go through. Once it is validated on the Ethereum blockchain, your ASX balance, on the top of the page, will update and a \"CLAIM\" button will appear. You will be able to claim your ASX tokens once the event is completed.\n7. That's it! You successfully participated in the ASX Genesis Event.\n\n*Once your transaction is validated, a smart contract, that works like an escrow, will receive your ASX tokens and keep them safe until the end of the Genesis Event, when you will be able to claim them. Claimed ASX tokens are not locked and there is no vesting.*\n\n*Team and partners are allowed to participate in the Genesis Event after the progress bar reaches 50%. If the desired amount of ASX that those parties intend to hold can't be fully minted during this event, the remaining amount will be purchased on Uniswap.*\n\n## Liquidity\n\nBy the end of the Genesis Event, the initial liquidity of the ASX token will be immediately provided as a full range position on Uniswap V3. Since the resulting liquidity provider (LP) token will be directly burned, this initial position will be perpetual.\n\nThe liquidity depth will represent 40% of the FDV (Fully Diluted Value) and its absolute value will be based on the total ASX minted.\n\n* At soft cap, 250 ETH will be paired with 62,500,000 ASX, pricing the token at $0.0077 / ASX with $962,500 of liquidity depth.\n* At hard cap, 800 ETH will be paired with 200,000,000 ASX, pricing the token at $0.0077 / ASX with $3,080,000 of liquidity depth.\n\n*The Genesis Event will end in 10 days after the soft cap is reached or when all ASX tokens are minted, whichever comes first. Any unminted ASX will be burned.*\n\n## Security\n\nWe were very careful when deciding the code for the ASX ERC-20 smart contract and, to make it the safest possible, we only allowed the absolutely necessary lines of code. There's no mint function, no pause function and the contract is not upgradeable. It is an immutable token on the Ethereum Mainnet Network.\n\nBoth the ERC-20 and the Genesis Event smart contracts were developed with the highest levels of security, leveraging the battle-tested OpenZeppelin standard. With the entire supply circulating by the end of the Genesis Event plus the immediate burn of the liquidity provider (LP) token, you can rest assured that the ASX token can never be hacked or rugged.\n\n### Important Notes\n\nThe team at ASX Labs will NEVER DM YOU FIRST or ask you for money on any platform. You should be very skeptical of any DMs received by anyone claiming to be from ASX Labs.\n\nOnly trust ASX Protocol's official channels at the bottom of this announcement for information surrounding the event.\n\nThe ASX token will only be available once the Genesis Event is completed. Only then you will be able to trade it on Uniswap. Be sure to always check the smart contract address before trading.\n\n\n---\n\nThis is the first step towards an omnichain yield future.

(the full text is 3588 words and takes about 5 − 10 minutes to read.)\n\nWe mean that as long as we have chased and loved each other, we can have an “Internet anniversary” every day, every year, for this young people to have fun and celebrate. If we are not even, we can also find online confidants. (I really hope that KK’s birthday can also catch this carnival on May 11 next year.)\n\n0406, 0505, seventh and ninth anniversaries… Looking back on these anniversaries this year, it is really more and more lively, and the more lively it is, the more prominent the coldness of the Internet. Youdao is in response to that sentence - busy anniversary, barren Internet.\n\nSo, do the beautiful days that I’ve heard of really exist?\n\n“The reason why we are here today is to celebrate the birthday of our best friend, Gu Li…”\n\nThe standard script for Ms. Gu Li’s birthday, oh, the same day is also her father’s memorial day, or the “rotten and smelly day” of the time sisters. From birthday greetings, birthday entries, birthday posters to outdoor screens, the little rich woman of the times is no less than an artist.\n\nMr. Liu mintao’s “red high heels” is the first direct shot actress in the history of internal entertainment. One must be arranged to commemorate the direct shot.\n\nIn the twinkling of an eye, sister Xun’s “a lot of people” expression bag has been for several years. By the way, it is Lu Fei and crayon Xiaoxin’s birthday on the same day. I wish the two Taurus children a happy birthday.\n\nAs for the grand carnival of “Internet anniversary”, at least not the draft.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2021, we watched the domestic entertainment talent show from the first year to hot and then to quietly end.\n\nThe first year, the day when the limited group ninepercent became a group, announced the arrival of a new era, and many people’s dreams began from this day;\n\nIn the second year, unine, a limited group, successfully promoted the era of draft automation because of its random ranking distribution;\n\nIn the third year, there was no debut night and no group. The building of internal entertainment draft was stopped when it was built to the second floor, which indirectly became a “uncompleted residential building”. Since then, it has become Xiufen’s “Qingming Festival”.\n\n“Youth 3” ixform made its debut quietly in an unnamed music. The debut night of the finals that failed to be broadcast was quietly buried together with the draft, which is sad.\n\nThe internal entertainment talent show has changed for only three or four years. Seeing him rise from a tall building, see his banquet guests, and see his building collapse, now, Xiufen people recall their youth by relying on the pictures of memories and on a special anniversary day.\n\nDo you want this blessing?\n\nA “Legend of Zhen Huan” can be said to have kept LETV I prosperous.\n\nMany years later, there are still a large number of audiences “passing the love pass”. The founder of Hua’er film and television, the producer of the legend of Zhen Huan, said: “the legend of Zhen Huan can bring more than 10 million profits to Hua’er film and television (which has been acquired by LETV) every year.”\n\nWell, why not?\n\nWhether it’s the birthday of ANN bird, the memorial day of Zhen Huan’s return to the palace, or the 300 year anniversary of the legend of Zhen Huan, it’s the audience’s real love for the play,\n\nThe audience is willing to look at a carefully carved work with a magnifying glass and see it again and again, which also shows that the audience has enough patience and appreciation ability for the work with real intention.\n\nFrom the examination questions of level 10 of the legend of Zhen Huan to how many episodes you can live in the palace, a variety of extended topics and challenges are still active on the platform today. This play seems to have become the spice of public life. Every day in the real-time square, people will plead with the creators of the legend of Zhen Huan to abide by the law and discipline, so as not to get the work off the shelves and become a public enemy of the whole people.\n\nSource: microblog screenshot\n\nThis year marks the ninth anniversary of the launch of the legend of Lu Zhen. Looking back on the whole story, Lu Zhen, an outstanding female representative of the Northern Qi Dynasty who was brave and firm and earned the position of Prime Minister for herself under the rule of the imperial power by relying on her own wisdom, is still a unique presence in the current TV series market.\n\nIn the past nine years, the actor himself has been in hot demand since his unknown place of origin. After a rough and hard journey, he finally got to Xintiandi and became the “85 flower” in the front line. I don’t know how ah Zhen, who is parallel to time and space, has also experienced unknown hardships. Is he happy with ah Zhan?\n\nOn the anniversary of another variety show “informal talks”, which has been with you for seven years, Chen Mingfa said that seven years is not a short life journey. His eldest daughter is seven years old. He saw some friends offline and told him that they were accompanying them from junior high school / high school to University / graduate school. He felt very honored to accompany you through your youth. These seven years of unhealthy time are also his youth and his UFO.\n\nThis UFO is straight ahead in any direction. It can take him to any place he wants to go, see the scenery, talk about any topic, and never die. He has been looking forward to seeing you again.\n\n“I can’t live without you.”\n\nLove me, scold me, whatever you want\n\n“Of course, I will be very moved. It shows that my acting skills have been recognized. We believe that there are such people around us. We believe that he (the role) has really come to the world. As an actor, there is nothing happier than this.” This is the true feeling of an actor who once worked with KK.\n\nThe time spent with the character is three months, six months or even longer to enter another person’s life and become this person. Experience his life and experience his joys and sorrows. “Sometimes it’s difficult to say goodbye. The hardest thing is to convince yourself that he doesn’t exist. If someone can remember him except me, at least he’s not so lonely.”\n\nThe audience can remember their own plays and characters, and even celebrate their birthdays and anniversaries outside the play. Remembering his life is a great affirmation for the actors.\n\nAt the most beautiful night BiliBili party in 2021, Zhang Wanyi, the actor of Chen Yannian in the awakening age, played a song “misplaced time and space”.\n\nPicture by network picture by network\n\nWhen the sound of leather shoes and chain rings at the same time, roles and players meet across time and space, maybe I", "timestamp": 1653240614, "digest": "RFaxcNKON4OJ8eGGLNGtFmiAL-IzfYeP6LeOFCsUZM4", "contributor": "0x1a79643D49D2C41D0E17B3Ad0DB838a27F85679a"}
{"id": "ID2VDvxQLTLDX4NJONhVShcga_zvVZ9CWUSq4YmAwjI", "title": "Heroines", "body": "So, we are very excited to announce \"The Heroines\" finally.\n\nBack in October, when we first started working on Heroes of the Metaverse,  one of the first decisions we had to make was how we would deal with the percentages of characters that would be males vs. females.\n\n***Who decides what?***\nHistorically, both in the NFT space and in the RPG/D&D world, women have been infra represented, and we did not want to reproduce the same stereotypes.\n\nThe logical decision was to divide the % of male characters vs. female characters by 50/50, closing the issue. Anything else would have been either negative or positive discrimination.\n\nAnd, of course, we didn’t want to dillute the series unnecessarily.\n\n## The five male founders dilemma\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the five founders are male heroes made us feel highly uncomfortable with the fact of creating Female Characters. Cesar Drawss -our Creative Director and artist- was the first one to raise the voice that he should not be the one designing female characters.\n\nBut in that early stage, the only members of Heroes of the Metaverse were the five founders.\n\nSo, all of these facts made us realize we were not comfortable or ready to launch the Heroines simultaneously as the Heroes.\n\n## Doodles: the inspiration\n\nAs everyone in this space wants to make something lasting and beautiful, we like to learn from everyone. And if there's someone we love about the NFT space is the creativity, the rule-breaking attitude, and the possibility of using technology to disrupt the status quo of what is possible and what's not.\n\n![Space Doodles is a subtle and brilliant innovation](https://doodles.app/images/doodle_plane.gif)\n\nAnd when Doodles announced the Space Doodles, what caught our attention was the technology they used. For us, the wrapped NFTs technology is one of the greatest innovations in the NFT space since the Azuki's ERC721A smart contract.\n\nEven if only a tiny percentage of people realize what this could become in the future, we also see this could be a great way to transform your Male Hero into a Female Hero. And, with it, let the market choose the % of female heroes vs. male heroes.\n\n## The Heroines\n\nAfter learning how the wrapped NFTs work, we decided not to use this technology.\n\nSince the change of sex is a variable and an image, we didn't need it as it does not bring any other value to the user. If we had wanted to use the wrapped NFTs, we would have required a second contract and a utility tool to enable the wrapping for the user. That would represent an unnecessary cost for the holder since the gas fee would have been much higher than how we are doing it.\n\nWe will create the Heroines transformation by ***uploading different JSON and image files to IPFS, and only modifying the file names while retrieving the token URI*.** As if it were two sides of one same coin. There is no tech innovation here, but this will ensure as much gas as possible as no extra code is written in the contract.\n\n![Switch from Hero to Heroine whenever you want. Cost = 0ETH + gas.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XI7iZg3UIJ-wbq2WqCrte.jpg?height=1080&width=1080)\n\n***These are the essential points of the transformation:***\n\n* You will be able to transform your Hero into a Heroine whenever you want and vice-versa.\n* The Heroines will be available some weeks after the first King's election.\n* The cost for converting your Hero will be 0ETH + gas.\n* Female artists have created our Heroes to ensure they lead the way of \"how a heroine should look like.\"\n* There will be a tool so everyone can see what the counterpart version would look like -even if not visible on marketplaces.", "timestamp": 1653240694, "digest": "rwRckqLH7RZ-zCPspfmfa64oUFMrJ0cwjbSvVT0JJrE", "contributor": "0x3cD877CF87DE6Bfc7f23eB4D0B3C20cb5a6FD080"}

{"id": "VlOwH3hRwLpzkf-cM4KI3L5w7VW0V9Bs5aG4iZfOM_U", "title": "How we found our Teddy :)", "body": "Last summer Sam FaceTime'd me & was talking to me about NFT’s. I knew what NFT’s were before we had that conversation but just never paid attention to it. He said : bro this space is perfect for you, don’t ask me why just go on twitter & join any NFT twitter space and you’ll find your journey, I am so excited to see where this story goes from here…\n\nI still remember saying : bro it’s 4 in the morning rn on a Saturday night and you’re telling me to go on twitter space rn and follow some monkey’s??? lol\n\nIn my mind I was like this dude’s lit & out of his right frame of mind. Finishing our sentences he said Teddy trust me, I know you and I am telling you this is a one way ticket to the life you have always dreamed but never lived and opportunities like this are very hard to find. I just laughed at it and I was like I’ll think about it and let you know…\n\nThen after a week I was playing soccer with Shadow in my backyard thinking about what Sam said the other day and the way he said it it was full of light. I could literally feel those good vibes. Btw Sam is a well known artist in the space, and now after spending all this time in this space I get it why he was hyper that day. Anyways, then I went on my twitter and switched my profile form private to public. I joined my first twitter space, It was with @NFTPrince & NFTsquirrels. Both are living legends and I respect them a lot. They shared tons of selfless advice to me on first day without even knowing who I was, what my real name is, or how I looked like. The knowledge was so valuable that basically I’ve never been rugged / scammed in this space till date. \n\nAfter spending some time in different spaces and observing how everything is working in this ecosystem, I focused on the fundamentals, the way people interact and react with certain things, what values they carried, and how do they find their feeling of importance. It was’nt very difficult for me to figure these things out because of my knowledge & experience with Social Media for over 5 years. I grew 36 million+ followers on Instagram via different entertainment pages and a network of over 250 million+ followers via networking in less than 6 months with just 2,000$ to start with from my college dorm.\n\nDuring that time Bored Ape’s were just flying and they still are but the vibes were immaculate last year you can’t deny that. I literally did a PHD on them and I was just astounded by their story but I was able to relate a lot of it to my life, it was so inspiring and fascinating. I was thinking so much about it, that even in my dreams I was seeing NFT’s all around me and my life changed the night of September 30 when i had that one lucid dream, I decided to do a project to share my story so that others can relate to it and be a part of it. \n\n( Note : This was’nt the main reason for me to do a NFT project. My main goal was and is still the same today that I want to leave this NFT space better than how I found it. )\n\nBack to the story, why Teddy? Well obviously. My friend’s call me Teddy and Teddies have been a part of everyone’s childhood and I believe people will hold on to that tradition forever. They provide us the comfort & companionship, a friend to talk to, and it’s not just kids who benefit from the positive effects of a comforting Teddy squeeze. Teddies are just universal and timeless.\n\nI put all of my traits and character and imagination’s in the art, from my expressions to the way I dress. Some of the assets are added for the aesthetics of the collection. I am not an artist but since I was the character I worked with few freelance artist’s to bring my idea on paper. They asked me for a sketch to give an idea of what I wanted and this is what I sent them lmao 😂😂😂😂😂😂\n\n![ That Yu-Gi-Oh and LV belt part has my heart lmaoooo😭😭😭. Tbh this image is still a lot better than my first one. Btw I am not rich lol, I don't have a AP watch or fancy items.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p7SJwXfpBXm-_G9fiTlu0.jpg?height=1280&width=960)\n\n![This looks decent lol. Lot better than what I came up with.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vxl5Z9dogU0G7wxHt-euI.png?height=1280&width=720)\n\n![That's me on the Left! Dw I am doxed to all our past holder's and lot of people in NFT space know me irl. My identity is just not public in the space atm. I'll reveal it when time is right.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CL1JyGEQS_ynX1v0M1WGn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nBack to the story, so once I got this I reached out to few professional artist’s in my network and I worked with multiple of them to find the perfect Teddy. We wanted to stick with 2D because 3D art is great but the market seemed to be doing well with 2D more than 3D collections. Ofcs art style isn’t the main reason for it but it does play a role. But then I am like let’s take the challenge and create something insane. During the time when I started the project, their were’nt any 3D project’s coming out just yet nor there were any noticeable Teddy Bear collections popping as long as I know. So then we decided to turn this into 3D. During this process one 3D artist reached out to me in my DM’s of one our meme page asking to collab, I am like okay cool lets give it a shot and see what you got. \n\n![This is what he came up with as base model. 💀💀💀](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FcshCcWqBzufElk9puKnW.png?height=772&width=778)\n\nYeah he just lost me on that base model. If ur surprised, I did’nt see this coming either, when I saw it for the first time I was out of words just like you are rn. I seriously had no comments on this image. So yeah I had to say no to that dude and look for another artist. The fact that people fake their LinkedIn and show you proof of work of other artist is just hilarious. So I asked one of my friend on telegram if he knew any artist to connect me and he did. \n\n![Idk tbh, it was just not it.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z3yiJzSTaGmqQdaHZroTJ.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nIt just did’nt feel right going with the full body at this point, gave pfp style a shot and see how it does. Initially the idea was, we will do pfp collection and in a seperate contract and we will give the holders full body version of their Teddy so they have both and can use it the way they like whether to animate or so with the source file…\n\n![I finally said yes to this one and made a deal with the artist and gave her an upfront amount for her time that we both agreed on. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ef-d0SnN5nrZH4EpHIfbn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThe reason why I paid upfront was because she told me she had financial instability and urgently need of money for rent and expenses so she would’nt be able to work full time on this project and it would take lot longer to complete the collection than what I was expecting. Plus I genuinely wanted to help her regardless of if she would work for the project or not due to her situation.\n\n![My mind, Her skills.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q7q8YdENYDP5zDlajLh05.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nWe decided to fully render and rigg the collection in the end after all the traits and assets are illustrated and confirmed so that their isn't any confusions and nothing is left out. But unfortunately she died in a car accident 3 days before our launch. I found out about it next day of her death from my friend I was completely devasted but I was more sad for her and her family. I communicated with our community and told them that guys we do not have the collection fully rigged and its in between 2D and 3D so we would have to pause the project for now until we find another artist and see how things go from there. \n\nBut then I was also out of funds because I put everything I had in the project initially. So I communicated this with the community in our discord and 34 people ended up minting 100 regardless of the situation. 10 were minted for team and 1 was minted by me personally to participate in the process just like any other member of community. They knew that mint had zero value and won’t have a secondary market value but yet they still supported. All they asked me was to not quit on my dream and to the challenge to make a come back from this situation. The collection won’t ever be revealed for the respect and honor of our artist. We communicated this with our holders as well and they are okay with it. A small portion of funds from royalties of our new collection will go towards her Family. Here’s the OpenSea link to that collection :\n\n[https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub](https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub)\n\nThen after I did an outreach again and managed to find a team of 4 professional 3D artist’s. Their past ventures have involved working with brands like Puma, Bangs and Lulu Lemon. Their Identities are anon as they wish to keep it that way but I have confirmed the veracity of their credentials. When I presented this entire idea and vision of the collection to them, after hearing me they instantly said yes and told be that we’re gonna make the best collection of 2022. We started working on it the same day and even with this team, I worked 1 on 1 with the team over screen shares for every single trait’s and asset’s and outcomes are just fantastic. Look It does’nt matter what people think of it but we do believe it is one of the greatest NFT collections that will ever be deployed on Blockchain. We’ve put our blood, sweat and tears in this collection as a team day in and day out. The collection is timeless & it will age well I can make that one promise for sure. \n\n![This collection is dedicated to someone who does'nt need to own it. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wKl-h3xgt9G73xjvxW_7_.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThe story will never have an end to be honest and I am just the captain of the boat as of now but at some point I want to hand the dream over to the community in a position that even if I am not present the story live forever as long as their is imagination left in this world.

{"id": "lIHG8Eoa04PwKjNsr4-_J18_bDEbzLsPrMtXL0oy2uQ", "title": "How we found our Teddy :)", "body": "Last summer Sam FaceTime'd me & was talking to me about NFT’s. I knew what NFT’s were before we had that conversation but just never paid attention to it. He said : bro this space is perfect for you, don’t ask me why just go on twitter & join any NFT twitter space and you’ll find your journey, I am so excited to see where this story goes from here…\n\nI still remember saying : bro it’s 4 in the morning rn on a Saturday night and you’re telling me to go on twitter space rn and follow some monkey’s??? lol\n\nIn my mind I was like this dude’s lit & out of his right frame of mind. Finishing our sentences he said Teddy trust me, I know you and I am telling you this is a one way ticket to the life you have always dreamed but never lived and opportunities like this are very hard to find. I just laughed at it and I was like I’ll think about it and let you know…\n\nThen after a week I was playing soccer with Shadow in my backyard thinking about what Sam said the other day and the way he said it it was full of light. I could literally feel those good vibes. Btw Sam is a well known artist in the space, and now after spending all this time in this space I get it why he was hyper that day. Anyways, then I went on my twitter and switched my profile form private to public. I joined my first twitter space, It was with @NFTPrince & NFTsquirrels. Both are living legends and I respect them a lot. They shared tons of selfless advice to me on first day without even knowing who I was, what my real name is, or how I looked like. The knowledge was so valuable that basically I’ve never been rugged / scammed in this space till date. \n\nAfter spending some time in different spaces and observing how everything is working in this ecosystem, I focused on the fundamentals, the way people interact and react with certain things, what values they carried, and how do they find their feeling of importance. It was’nt very difficult for me to figure these things out because of my knowledge & experience with Social Media for over 5 years. I grew 36 million+ followers on Instagram via different entertainment pages and a network of over 250 million+ followers via networking in less than 6 months with just 2,000$ to start with from my college dorm.\n\nDuring that time Bored Ape’s were just flying and they still are but the vibes were immaculate last year you can’t deny that. I literally did a PHD on them and I was just astounded by their story but I was able to relate a lot of it to my life, it was so inspiring and fascinating. I was thinking so much about it, that even in my dreams I was seeing NFT’s all around me and my life changed the night of September 30 when i had that one lucid dream, I decided to do a project to share my story so that others can relate to it and be a part of it. \n\n( Note : This was’nt the main reason for me to do a NFT project. My main goal was and is still the same today that I want to leave this NFT space better than how I found it. )\n\nBack to the story, why Teddy? Well obviously. My friend’s call me Teddy and Teddies have been a part of everyone’s childhood and I believe people will hold on to that tradition forever. They provide us the comfort & companionship, a friend to talk to, and it’s not just kids who benefit from the positive effects of a comforting Teddy squeeze. Teddies are just universal and timeless.\n\nI put all of my traits and character and imagination’s in the art, from my expressions to the way I dress. Some of the assets are added for the aesthetics of the collection. I am not an artist but since I was the character I worked with few freelance artist’s to bring my idea on paper. They asked me for a sketch to give an idea of what I wanted and this is what I sent them lmao 😂😂😂😂😂😂\n\n![ That Yu-Gi-Oh and LV belt part has my heart lmaoooo😭😭😭.

Presque tous les réseaux blockchain vantent le nombre élevé de transactions par seconde (TPS) comme un argument de vente. Cependant, le TPS n'est pas une mesure valable pour comparer les réseaux blockchain, ce qui rend difficile l'évaluation de leurs performances relatives. De plus, les grands nombres de TPS ont généralement un coût, ce qui pose la question suivante : ces réseaux sont-ils réellement évolutifs ou se contentent-ils d'augmenter leur débit ?\n\nExaminons donc comment définir la scalabilité, quels compromis sont faits pour y parvenir et pourquoi les Validity Rollups constituent la solution la scalabilité par excellence.\n\n### Toutes les transactions ne sont pas égales\n\nTout d'abord, nous devons établir notre affirmation selon laquelle la mesure simple et pratique des TPS ne sont pas une mesure précise de la scalabilité.\n\nPour compenser les nœuds pour l'exécution des transactions (et pour dissuader les utilisateurs de spammer le réseau avec des calculs inutiles), les blockchains facturent des frais proportionnels à la charge de calcul imposée à la blockchain. Dans Ethereum, la complexité de la charge de calcul est mesurée en gas. Le gas étant une mesure très pratique de la complexité des transactions, le terme sera utilisé tout au long de cet article pour les blockchains autres qu'Ethereum, même s'il est généralement spécifique à Ethereum.\n\nLes transactions diffèrent considérablement en termes de complexité et, par conséquent, de quantité de gas qu'elles consomment. Bitcoin, le pionnier des transactions de pair à pair (P2P) trustless, ne prend en charge que le rudimentaire script Bitcoin. Ces simples transferts d'adresse à adresse consomment peu de gas. En revanche, les chaînes de smart contract comme Ethereum ou Solana prennent en charge une machine virtuelle et des langages de programmation complets de Turing qui permettent des transactions beaucoup plus complexes. Par conséquent, les dApps comme Uniswap nécessitent beaucoup plus de gas.\n\nC'est pourquoi il est absurde de comparer les TPS de différentes blockchains. Ce que nous devrions plutôt comparer, c'est la capacité de calcul ou débit.\n\nToutes les blockchains ont une taille de bloc (variable) et un temps de bloc qui déterminent combien d'unités de calcul peuvent être traitées par bloc et à quelle vitesse un nouveau bloc peut être ajouté. Ensemble, ces deux variables déterminent le débit d'une blockchain.\n\n## Qu'est-ce qui limite la scalabilité ?\n\nLes blockchains s'efforcent d'être des réseaux inclusifs et décentralisés au maximum. Pour y parvenir, deux propriétés fondamentales doivent être contrôlées.\n\n### 1. Exigences matérielles\n\nLa décentralisation d'un réseau blockchain est déterminé par la capacité du nœud le plus faible du réseau à vérifier la blockchain et à en conserver l'état. Par conséquent, les coûts de fonctionnement d'un nœud (matériel, bande passante et stockage) doivent être maintenus aussi bas que possible afin de permettre à un maximum d'individus de devenir des participants permissionless au réseau trustless.\n\n### 2. Croissance de l'État\n\nLa croissance de l'état (state growth) fait référence à la vitesse de croissance de la blockchain. Plus le débit d'une blockchain est élevé par unité de temps, plus la blockchain se développe rapidement. Les nœuds complets stockent l'historique du réseau, et ils doivent être en mesure de valider l'état du réseau. L'état d'Ethereum est stocké et référencé à l'aide de structures efficaces telles que des arbres ([arbre de Merkle](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbre_de_Merkle)). Au fur et à mesure que l'état se développe, de nouvelles feuilles et branches sont ajoutées, ce qui rend l'exécution de certaines actions toujours plus complexe et plus longue. Au fur et à mesure que la blockchain s'agrandit, elle empire l’exécution par les nœuds dans le pire des cas, ce qui entraîne un temps toujours plus long pour valider les nouveaux blocs. Au fil du temps, cela augmente également le temps total nécessaire à la synchronisation d'un nœud complet.\n\n## Impacts néfastes de l'augmentation du débit\n\n### 1. Nombre de nœuds\n\nLes exigences minimales pour faire fonctionner un nœud et le nombre de nœuds sont les suivants :\n\n* Bitcoin¹ : 350 Go d'espace disque, connexion 5 Mbit/s, 1 Go de RAM, CPU >1 Ghz. **Nombre de nœuds : \\~10 000**\n* Ethereum² : 500GB+ espace disque SSD, connexion 25 Mbit/s, 4-8GB RAM, CPU 2-4 cores. **Nombre de nœuds : \\~6 000**\n* Solana³ : 1,5 To+ d'espace disque SSD, connexion 300 Mbit/s, 128 Go de RAM, CPU 12+ cœurs. **Nombre de nœuds : \\~1 200**\n\nNotez que plus les exigences en matière de CPU, de bande passante et de stockage pour les nœuds nécessaires au débit d'une blockchain sont élevées, moins il y a de nœuds sur le réseau, ce qui entraîne une décentralisation plus faible et un réseau moins inclusif.\n\n### 2. Temps de synchronisation d'un nœud complet\n\nLorsqu'un nœud fonctionne pour la première fois, il doit se synchroniser avec tous les nœuds existants, télécharger et valider l'état du réseau depuis le bloc de genèse jusqu'à l'extrémité de la chaîne. Ce processus doit être aussi rapide et efficace que possible pour permettre à quiconque d'agir en tant que participant permissionless du protocole.\n\nEn prenant comme indicateur les tests de synchronisation des [nœuds Bitcoin 2020](https://blog.lopp.net/2020-bitcoin-node-performance-tests/) et [2021](https://blog.lopp.net/2021-altcoin-node-sync-tests/) de Jameson Lopp, le tableau 1 compare le temps nécessaire à la synchronisation d'un nœud complet de Bitcoin, d'Ethereum et de Solana sur un PC grand public moyen.\n\n![Tableau 1. Comparaison du débit de la blockchain et de la synchronisation des nœuds](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S0FjQNLqB60bURgiddwGb.png?height=450&width=1400)\n\nLe tableau 1 montre que l'augmentation du débit entraîne des temps de synchronisation plus longs, car de plus en plus de données doivent être traitées et stockées.\n\nBien que des améliorations soient constamment apportées au logiciel des nœuds pour atténuer le défi posé par la croissance de la blockchain (réduction de l'empreinte du disque, vitesses de synchronisation plus rapides, meilleure résistance aux pannes, modularisation de certains composants, etc.\n\n### Comment définir la scalabilité ?\n\nLa scalabilité est le terme le plus mal représenté dans l'espace blockchain. Si l'augmentation du débit est souhaitable, elle n'est qu'une partie du puzzle.\n\n***La scalabilité*** *signifie* ***plus de transactions*** pour le ***même matériel***.\n\nPour cette raison, la scalabilité peut être séparée en deux catégories.\n\n### La scalabilité du séquenceur\n\nLe séquençage décrit l'acte d'ordonner et de traiter les transactions dans un réseau. Comme il a été établi précédemment, toute blockchain pourrait trivialement augmenter son débit en augmentant la taille des blocs et en raccourcissant leur durée jusqu'à un point où l'impact négatif sur sa décentralisation est jugé trop important. Mais le fait d'ajuster ces simples paramètres ne permet pas d'obtenir les améliorations nécessaires. L'EVM d'Ethereum peut, en théorie, [gérer jusqu'à environ 2 000 TPS](https://twitter.com/dankrad/status/1459607325854121989), ce qui est insuffisant pour répondre à la demande d'espace de bloc à long terme. Pour mettre à l'échelle le séquençage, Solana a fait quelques innovations impressionnantes : tirer parti d'un environnement d'exécution parallélisable et d'un mécanisme de consensus astucieux, qui permet un débit bien plus efficace. Mais, malgré ses améliorations, il n'est ni suffisant ni évolutif. À mesure que Solana augmente son débit, les coûts matériels pour faire fonctionner un nœud et traiter les transactions augmentent également.\n\n### Scalabilité de la vérification\n\nLa scalabilité de la vérification décrit des approches qui augmentent le débit sans imposer aux nœuds des coûts matériels toujours plus élevés. Plus précisément, elle fait référence aux innovations cryptographiques telles que les preuves de validité. Elles sont la raison pour laquelle les Validity Rollups peuvent faire évoluer une blockchain de manière durable.\n\n### **Qu'est-ce qu'un Validity Rollup ?**\n\nLes Validity Rollups (également connus sous le nom de \"ZK-Rollups\") déplacent le calcul et le stockage d'état off-chain mais conservent une petite quantité de certaines données on-chain. Un smart contract sur la blockchain sous-jacente maintient la racine de l'état du Rollup. Sur le Rollup, un lot de transactions hautement compressées, ainsi que la racine de l'état actuel, sont envoyés à un Prouveur off-chain. Le Prouveur calcule les transactions, génère une preuve de validité des résultats et de la nouvelle racine d'état, et l'envoie à un Verifieur on-chain. Le vérifieur vérifie la preuve de validité et le smart contract qui maintient l'état du rollup, le met à jour avec le nouvel état fourni par le vérifieur.\n\n### **Comment les Validity Rollup évoluent-ils avec les mêmes exigences matérielles ?**\n\nMême si les Prouveurs nécessitent du matériel haut de gamme, ils n'ont pas d'impact sur la décentralisation d'une blockchain, car la validité des transactions est garantie par des preuves mathématiquement vérifiables.\n\nCe qui importe, ce sont les exigences pour vérifier les preuves. Comme les données impliquées sont hautement compressées et largement abstraites par le calcul, leur impact sur les nœuds de la blockchain sous-jacente est minime.\n\nLes vérifieurs (nœuds Ethereum) n'ont pas besoin de matériel haut de gamme, et la taille des lots n'augmente pas les exigences matérielles. Seules les transitions d'état et une petite quantité de données d'appel doivent être traitées et stockées par les nœuds. Cela permet à tous les nœuds Ethereum de vérifier les lots Validity Rollup en utilisant leur matériel existant.\n\n### **Plus il y a de transactions, moins c'est cher**\n\nDans les blockchains traditionnelles, plus il y a de transactions, plus le coût est élevé pour tout le monde, car l'espace du bloc se remplit et les utilisateurs doivent surenchérir sur le marché des frais pour que leurs transactions soient incluses.\n\nPour un Validity Rollup, cette dynamique est inversée. La vérification d'un lot de transactions sur Ethereum a un certain coût. Au fur et à mesure que le nombre de transactions dans un lot augmente, le coût de vérification du lot augmente à un rythme exponentiellement plus lent. L'ajout d'un plus grand nombre de transactions à un lot entraîne des frais de transaction moins élevés, même si le coût de vérification du lot augmente, car il est amorti sur toutes les transactions du lot. Les modules d'extension de validité veulent qu'un lot contienne le plus grand nombre possible de transactions, afin que les frais de vérification puissent être répartis entre tous les utilisateurs. Au fur et à mesure que la taille du lot augmente jusqu'à l'infini, les frais amortis par transaction convergent vers zéro, c'est-à-dire que plus il y a de transactions dans un Validity Rollup, moins c'est cher pour tout le monde.\n\ndYdX, une dApp alimentée par un Validity Rollup, voit fréquemment des lots de plus de 12 000 transactions. La comparaison de la consommation de gas des mêmes transactions sur le Mainnet et sur un Validity Rollup illustre les gains de scalabilité :\n\nRèglement d'une transaction dYdX sur Ethereum Mainnet : **200 000 gas**\n\nRèglement d'une transaction dYdX sur StarkEx : <**500 gas**\n\nUne autre façon de voir les choses : Le coût principal des Validity Rollups évolue linéairement avec le nombre d'utilisateurs d'un même lot.\n\n### **Pourquoi les Optimistic Rollups ne sont pas aussi scalable qu'on pourrait le penser ?**\n\nEn théorie, les Optimistic Rollups offrent presque les mêmes avantages de scalabilité que les validity rollups. Mais il existe une distinction importante : Les Optimistic Rollups sont optimisés pour le cas moyen, alors que les Validity Rollups sont optimisés pour le cas le plus défavorable.

Ainsi, pour contester une fraude, l'utilisateur doit synchroniser un nœud complet Ethereum, un nœud complet L2, et calculer lui-même la transaction suspecte.\n\nDans le pire des cas, un utilisateur n'aurait qu'à synchroniser un nœud complet Ethereum pour vérifier la preuve de validité, s'épargnant ainsi la charge de calcul.\n\nContrairement aux Validity Rollups, le coût des Optimistic Rollups s'échelonne linéairement avec le nombre de transactions au lieu du nombre d'utilisateurs, ce qui les rend plus chers.\n\n### **Dernière pièce du puzzle - Accès permissionless à l'état du rollup**\n\nPour garantir la validité des transactions, les utilisateurs doivent exécuter un nœud Ethereum uniquement. Cependant, les utilisateurs et les développeurs peuvent vouloir voir, et exécuter, l'état et l'exécution du Rollup à diverses fins. Un nœud L2 d'indexation répond parfaitement à ce besoin. Non seulement il permet aux utilisateurs de voir les transactions dans le réseau, mais il s'agit également d'une pièce essentielle nécessaire au fonctionnement de l'infrastructure de l'écosystème. Les indexeurs comme The Graph, Alchemy, Infura, les réseaux Oracle comme Chainlink, et les explorateurs de blocs, tous sont entièrement pris en charge par un nœud L2 d'indexation permissionless.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDe nombreuses approches pour aborder la scalabilité des blockchains se concentrent à tort sur l'augmentation du débit.

The money circle leaders suffered heavy losses, and the maximum value decreased by nearly 90%", "body": "Cryptocurrency is still being sold, and bitcoin has fallen to its lowest level since December 2020.\n\nMarket data show that bitcoin has fallen for seven consecutive days - the longest consecutive decline since March 2020. On May 12, bitcoin fell below US $27000 / piece again, and other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum could not hide the decline. It fell 13% to less than US $1800 / piece, continuing to brush the new low since July last year. Ethereum fell 19.6% in 24 hours. As of press time, Ethereum has fallen by more than 16% to US $1770 / piece.\n\nIn fact, analysts have always regarded $30000 as an important milestone of bitcoin, and many people expect that once it falls below, its decline may accelerate. Technical analysts said bitcoin now needs to hold the $28000 mark, which could trigger a new wave of selling.\n\nRecently, the US stock market has continued to plummet. Some analysts believe that as traditional funds such as hedge funds and family trusts have entered the field of cryptocurrency in the past two years, digital assets have developed more and more synchronously with stocks. Such funds are more likely to sell cryptocurrency assets during market fluctuations.\n\nAt the same time, cryptocurrency has also been hit by the decoupling of stable currency. The stable currency was originally regarded as the least volatile currency in the cryptocurrency world, linked to the value of the currency issued by the government. However, in the past week, ust was decoupled from the US dollar exchange rate twice. The lowest value of UST, which was supposed to be the anchor of US $1, fell to US $0.65, triggering a crisis of confidence and impacting the overall cryptocurrency market.\n\nPreviously, the sister token Luna of ust was once called “coin circle Maotai” by coin circle players. It soared from the lowest point of US $0.12 to US $119.5, with a maximum market value of US $41 billion (about more than 270 billion yuan). Recently, its price once fell below US $2 and its market value once fell to US $1.1 billion.\n\nAccording to the data of on-line masters under okcloud chain, up to now, 43 companies or institutions, including gray-scale investment, hold 1225600 bitcoins. More than $13 billion of bitcoin held by institutions and companies including Tesla has evaporated. Among them, Aker ASA lost US $21.62 million, metu lost US $19.75 million and plunwra lost US $16.95 million, ranking in the top three. In addition, Tesla holds 40900 bitcoins, with an average price of $32000.\n\nAt the same time, the value of investment leaders has also shrunk due to the recent sharp decline. According to the Bloomberg billionaire index, the personal wealth of coinbase founder Brian Armstrong was $13.7 billion in November last year. So far, his wealth has evaporated by about 83% to $2.3 billion.\n\nCHANGPENG Zhao, chief executive of coin security, suffered more losses than Armstrong. According to the Bloomberg billionaire index in January, Zhao CHANGPENG’s personal wealth was $96 billion, which had been reduced to $11.6 billion as of May 11, with an evaporation rate of nearly 90%.", "timestamp": 1653240790, "digest": "URcFj5oYwpD6ozNBQkZu2SIHPlr-d5wYDqokFQHsLRo", "contributor": "0x50BbaEA569F29abd3c0d95e75A09E4f1876c98E4"}

{"id": "_JlEEPEaYZYjnl5-Gd_UL4q6sI3g6HDVEUh7t-HQRTA", "title": "On Nowness and Collective Memory", "body": "> “It is obvious to everybody that the phenomena of the world are evidently irreversible. I mean things happen that do not happen the other way. You drop a cup and it breaks, and you can sit there a long time waiting for the pieces to come together and jump back into your hand. If you watch the waves of the sea breaking, you can stand there and wait for the great moment when the foam collects together, rises up out of the sea, and falls back farther out from the shore — it would be very pretty!” - Richard Feynman\n\nWe all have an immediate, almost visceral understanding of the distinction between the past and the future, even from the most mundane experiences. We learn from the past, and we plan for the future. We celebrate, we commemorate, we mourn, and we hope. Yet, as Feynman notes, no one would sit and wait after a long enough time for the cup to come back together.\n\nBut although we so clearly understand the distinction between past and future so many of us spend surprisingly little time thinking about the present - the way we cultivate it and the way we become inspired by it. The more I think about it the more surprising this is, since in a sense there is no period quite so long as right now.\n\nMore than anything else this is because *now* is such a slippery concept in the first place. On the one hand, there is a standard notion of *nowness* we’re all naturally in tune with as we check our calendars, our watches, and our phones. On the other, there’s the time we truly *experience*. In ancient Greek, the distinction between kronos (*chronological, measured time*) and [kairos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairos) (*qualitative, lived time*) helped us better understand what we mean by the present moment. Similarly, in Sanskrit, *[ritu](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/ritu#sanskrit)* played a key cultural (and often spiritual) role marking meaningful moments of change.\n\nIn the current day, especially in light of the pandemic, our attention has slowly returned to the concept of lived time as a [subject of analysis](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/how-the-coronavirus-pandemic-is-warping-our-sense-of-time). As we all experienced time dilation together, it became more relevant, and in some ways easier for us to pinpoint just how much of an impact new experiences (and hence new memories) can have on our ability to move from one moment to the next.\n\n## Rhythm, Ritual, and Collective Memory\n\nIn every era the way we each individually interpret time comes with collective consequences. As the origins of words like kairos and ritu suggest, there has always been a sense of life and ripeness that comes with a change in environment, and with new experiences.\n\nSimultaneously, there is a sense of punctuation that comes with *ritual* which guides our ability to recollect our collective memory. Rituals are intentional, repeated moments with others or even with ourselves, which somehow, incredibly, cleanse our spirits and create a renewed sense of novelty (and alter our sense of time). But the types of rituals we take part in have changed extensively over time, with the rise and fall variations of social, political, theological / ecclesiastic tradition, and perhaps most importantly with the rise of new technologies.\n\nThese times of change in ritual haven’t been left unexplored. The ethnographer Arnold van Gennep, anthropologist Victor Turner, and even the psychologist Carl Jung all touched on the notion of liminal phases in which changes in rituals and customs occur – another kind of collective present. Today, people might like to call these changes [vibe shifts](https://www.thecut.com/2022/02/a-vibe-shift-is-coming.html).\n\nWith the ever increasing pace of technology, these shifts are occurring faster than ever. With the introduction of the [printing press](https://fs.blog/memory-printing-press/), we moved from spoken words held in memory to books as the main store of human knowledge.\n\nAs Marshall McLuhan noted, computers, connected via the internet, have further complicated the way we remember and the way we flow through time. Especially in the modern day, we’re constantly bouncing between algorithmically generated and distributed narratives that lack the same weight, the same auras as those that we collectively imagined together.\n\nIt’s no surprise then that the idea of [lore](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1503415155975204864) has resurfaced. But perhaps the most important questions remain unasked: namely, what actions can we take to collectively maintain it?\n\nThere are many answers to this question, and I’m not even certain there’s a right one, but it certainly feels like we need new forms of ritual that we can enact together to draw ourselves back to [intentionality](https://scott.mirror.xyz/U8aWHSX_HHHYcN1GvbTcBnZbAR7eNeJ_61WIOuSguF8); to regain a sense of focus and in turn a sense of true belonging.\n\nExploring these rituals, however, can’t be done in writing. It can’t be done between a writer and an audience. It has to be done together.\n\n*Thanks as always to Andy Tudhope, David Phelps, and Vivek Singh for graciously reviewing this draft. Please note, this draft will likely change over time as I update my thinking and continue to add more depth and context.

Presque tous les réseaux blockchain vantent le nombre élevé de transactions par seconde (TPS) comme un argument de vente. Cependant, le TPS n'est pas une mesure valable pour comparer les réseaux blockchain, ce qui rend difficile l'évaluation de leurs performances relatives. De plus, les grands nombres de TPS ont généralement un coût, ce qui pose la question suivante : ces réseaux sont-ils réellement évolutifs ou se contentent-ils d'augmenter leur débit ?\n\nExaminons donc comment définir la scalabilité, quels compromis sont faits pour y parvenir et pourquoi les Validity Rollups constituent la solution la scalabilité par excellence.\n\n### Toutes les transactions ne sont pas égales\n\nTout d'abord, nous devons établir notre affirmation selon laquelle la mesure simple et pratique des TPS ne sont pas une mesure précise de la scalabilité.\n\nPour compenser les nœuds pour l'exécution des transactions (et pour dissuader les utilisateurs de spammer le réseau avec des calculs inutiles), les blockchains facturent des frais proportionnels à la charge de calcul imposée à la blockchain. Dans Ethereum, la complexité de la charge de calcul est mesurée en gas. Le gas étant une mesure très pratique de la complexité des transactions, le terme sera utilisé tout au long de cet article pour les blockchains autres qu'Ethereum, même s'il est généralement spécifique à Ethereum.\n\nLes transactions diffèrent considérablement en termes de complexité et, par conséquent, de quantité de gas qu'elles consomment. Bitcoin, le pionnier des transactions de pair à pair (P2P) trustless, ne prend en charge que le rudimentaire script Bitcoin. Ces simples transferts d'adresse à adresse consomment peu de gas. En revanche, les chaînes de smart contract comme Ethereum ou Solana prennent en charge une machine virtuelle et des langages de programmation complets de Turing qui permettent des transactions beaucoup plus complexes. Par conséquent, les dApps comme Uniswap nécessitent beaucoup plus de gas.\n\nC'est pourquoi il est absurde de comparer les TPS de différentes blockchains. Ce que nous devrions plutôt comparer, c'est la capacité de calcul ou débit.\n\nToutes les blockchains ont une taille de bloc (variable) et un temps de bloc qui déterminent combien d'unités de calcul peuvent être traitées par bloc et à quelle vitesse un nouveau bloc peut être ajouté. Ensemble, ces deux variables déterminent le débit d'une blockchain.\n\n## Qu'est-ce qui limite la scalabilité ?\n\nLes blockchains s'efforcent d'être des réseaux inclusifs et décentralisés au maximum. Pour y parvenir, deux propriétés fondamentales doivent être contrôlées.\n\n### 1. Exigences matérielles\n\nLa décentralisation d'un réseau blockchain est déterminé par la capacité du nœud le plus faible du réseau à vérifier la blockchain et à en conserver l'état. Par conséquent, les coûts de fonctionnement d'un nœud (matériel, bande passante et stockage) doivent être maintenus aussi bas que possible afin de permettre à un maximum d'individus de devenir des participants permissionless au réseau trustless.\n\n### 2. Croissance de l'État\n\nLa croissance de l'état (state growth) fait référence à la vitesse de croissance de la blockchain. Plus le débit d'une blockchain est élevé par unité de temps, plus la blockchain se développe rapidement. Les nœuds complets stockent l'historique du réseau, et ils doivent être en mesure de valider l'état du réseau. L'état d'Ethereum est stocké et référencé à l'aide de structures efficaces telles que des arbres ([arbre de Merkle](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbre_de_Merkle)). Au fur et à mesure que l'état se développe, de nouvelles feuilles et branches sont ajoutées, ce qui rend l'exécution de certaines actions toujours plus complexe et plus longue. Au fur et à mesure que la blockchain s'agrandit, elle empire l’exécution par les nœuds dans le pire des cas, ce qui entraîne un temps toujours plus long pour valider les nouveaux blocs. Au fil du temps, cela augmente également le temps total nécessaire à la synchronisation d'un nœud complet.\n\n## Impacts néfastes de l'augmentation du débit\n\n### 1. Nombre de nœuds\n\nLes exigences minimales pour faire fonctionner un nœud et le nombre de nœuds sont les suivants :\n\n* Bitcoin¹ : 350 Go d'espace disque, connexion 5 Mbit/s, 1 Go de RAM, CPU >1 Ghz. **Nombre de nœuds : \\~10 000**\n* Ethereum² : 500GB+ espace disque SSD, connexion 25 Mbit/s, 4-8GB RAM, CPU 2-4 cores. **Nombre de nœuds : \\~6 000**\n* Solana³ : 1,5 To+ d'espace disque SSD, connexion 300 Mbit/s, 128 Go de RAM, CPU 12+ cœurs. **Nombre de nœuds : \\~1 200**\n\nNotez que plus les exigences en matière de CPU, de bande passante et de stockage pour les nœuds nécessaires au débit d'une blockchain sont élevées, moins il y a de nœuds sur le réseau, ce qui entraîne une décentralisation plus faible et un réseau moins inclusif.\n\n### 2. Temps de synchronisation d'un nœud complet\n\nLorsqu'un nœud fonctionne pour la première fois, il doit se synchroniser avec tous les nœuds existants, télécharger et valider l'état du réseau depuis le bloc de genèse jusqu'à l'extrémité de la chaîne. Ce processus doit être aussi rapide et efficace que possible pour permettre à quiconque d'agir en tant que participant permissionless du protocole.\n\nEn prenant comme indicateur les tests de synchronisation des [nœuds Bitcoin 2020](https://blog.lopp.net/2020-bitcoin-node-performance-tests/) et [2021](https://blog.lopp.net/2021-altcoin-node-sync-tests/) de Jameson Lopp, le tableau 1 compare le temps nécessaire à la synchronisation d'un nœud complet de Bitcoin, d'Ethereum et de Solana sur un PC grand public moyen.\n\n![Tableau 1. Comparaison du débit de la blockchain et de la synchronisation des nœuds](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S0FjQNLqB60bURgiddwGb.png?height=450&width=1400)\n\nLe tableau 1 montre que l'augmentation du débit entraîne des temps de synchronisation plus longs, car de plus en plus de données doivent être traitées et stockées.\n\nBien que des améliorations soient constamment apportées au logiciel des nœuds pour atténuer le défi posé par la croissance de la blockchain (réduction de l'empreinte du disque, vitesses de synchronisation plus rapides, meilleure résistance aux pannes, modularisation de certains composants, etc.\n\n### Comment définir la scalabilité ?\n\nLa scalabilité est le terme le plus mal représenté dans l'espace blockchain. Si l'augmentation du débit est souhaitable, elle n'est qu'une partie du puzzle.\n\n***La scalabilité*** *signifie* ***plus de transactions*** pour le ***même matériel***.\n\nPour cette raison, la scalabilité peut être séparée en deux catégories.\n\n### La scalabilité du séquenceur\n\nLe séquençage décrit l'acte d'ordonner et de traiter les transactions dans un réseau. Comme il a été établi précédemment, toute blockchain pourrait trivialement augmenter son débit en augmentant la taille des blocs et en raccourcissant leur durée jusqu'à un point où l'impact négatif sur sa décentralisation est jugé trop important. Mais le fait d'ajuster ces simples paramètres ne permet pas d'obtenir les améliorations nécessaires. L'EVM d'Ethereum peut, en théorie, [gérer jusqu'à environ 2 000 TPS](https://twitter.com/dankrad/status/1459607325854121989), ce qui est insuffisant pour répondre à la demande d'espace de bloc à long terme. Pour mettre à l'échelle le séquençage, Solana a fait quelques innovations impressionnantes : tirer parti d'un environnement d'exécution parallélisable et d'un mécanisme de consensus astucieux, qui permet un débit bien plus efficace. Mais, malgré ses améliorations, il n'est ni suffisant ni évolutif. À mesure que Solana augmente son débit, les coûts matériels pour faire fonctionner un nœud et traiter les transactions augmentent également.\n\n### Scalabilité de la vérification\n\nLa scalabilité de la vérification décrit des approches qui augmentent le débit sans imposer aux nœuds des coûts matériels toujours plus élevés. Plus précisément, elle fait référence aux innovations cryptographiques telles que les preuves de validité. Elles sont la raison pour laquelle les Validity Rollups peuvent faire évoluer une blockchain de manière durable.\n\n### **Qu'est-ce qu'un Validity Rollup ?**\n\nLes Validity Rollups (également connus sous le nom de \"ZK-Rollups\") déplacent le calcul et le stockage d'état off-chain mais conservent une petite quantité de certaines données on-chain. Un smart contract sur la blockchain sous-jacente maintient la racine de l'état du Rollup. Sur le Rollup, un lot de transactions hautement compressées, ainsi que la racine de l'état actuel, sont envoyés à un Prouveur off-chain. Le Prouveur calcule les transactions, génère une preuve de validité des résultats et de la nouvelle racine d'état, et l'envoie à un Verifieur on-chain. Le vérifieur vérifie la preuve de validité et le smart contract qui maintient l'état du rollup, le met à jour avec le nouvel état fourni par le vérifieur.\n\n### **Comment les Validity Rollup évoluent-ils avec les mêmes exigences matérielles ?**\n\nMême si les Prouveurs nécessitent du matériel haut de gamme, ils n'ont pas d'impact sur la décentralisation d'une blockchain, car la validité des transactions est garantie par des preuves mathématiquement vérifiables.\n\nCe qui importe, ce sont les exigences pour vérifier les preuves. Comme les données impliquées sont hautement compressées et largement abstraites par le calcul, leur impact sur les nœuds de la blockchain sous-jacente est minime.\n\nLes vérifieurs (nœuds Ethereum) n'ont pas besoin de matériel haut de gamme, et la taille des lots n'augmente pas les exigences matérielles. Seules les transitions d'état et une petite quantité de données d'appel doivent être traitées et stockées par les nœuds. Cela permet à tous les nœuds Ethereum de vérifier les lots Validity Rollup en utilisant leur matériel existant.\n\n### **Plus il y a de transactions, moins c'est cher**\n\nDans les blockchains traditionnelles, plus il y a de transactions, plus le coût est élevé pour tout le monde, car l'espace du bloc se remplit et les utilisateurs doivent surenchérir sur le marché des frais pour que leurs transactions soient incluses.\n\nPour un Validity Rollup, cette dynamique est inversée. La vérification d'un lot de transactions sur Ethereum a un certain coût. Au fur et à mesure que le nombre de transactions dans un lot augmente, le coût de vérification du lot augmente à un rythme exponentiellement plus lent. L'ajout d'un plus grand nombre de transactions à un lot entraîne des frais de transaction moins élevés, même si le coût de vérification du lot augmente, car il est amorti sur toutes les transactions du lot. Les modules d'extension de validité veulent qu'un lot contienne le plus grand nombre possible de transactions, afin que les frais de vérification puissent être répartis entre tous les utilisateurs. Au fur et à mesure que la taille du lot augmente jusqu'à l'infini, les frais amortis par transaction convergent vers zéro, c'est-à-dire que plus il y a de transactions dans un Validity Rollup, moins c'est cher pour tout le monde.\n\ndYdX, une dApp alimentée par un Validity Rollup, voit fréquemment des lots de plus de 12 000 transactions. La comparaison de la consommation de gas des mêmes transactions sur le Mainnet et sur un Validity Rollup illustre les gains de scalabilité :\n\nRèglement d'une transaction dYdX sur Ethereum Mainnet : **200 000 gas**\n\nRèglement d'une transaction dYdX sur StarkEx : <**500 gas**\n\nUne autre façon de voir les choses : Le coût principal des Validity Rollups évolue linéairement avec le nombre d'utilisateurs d'un même lot.\n\n### **Pourquoi les Optimistic Rollups ne sont pas aussi scalable qu'on pourrait le penser ?**\n\nEn théorie, les Optimistic Rollups offrent presque les mêmes avantages de scalabilité que les validity rollups. Mais il existe une distinction importante : Les Optimistic Rollups sont optimisés pour le cas moyen, alors que les Validity Rollups sont optimisés pour le cas le plus défavorable. Les systèmes de blockchain fonctionnant dans des conditions extrêmement défavorables, l'optimisation pour le pire des cas est le seul moyen d'assurer la sécurité.\n\nDans le pire cas du **Optimistic Rollups,** les transactions d'un utilisateur ne seront pas vérifiées par les contrôleurs de fraude. Ainsi, pour contester une fraude, l'utilisateur doit synchroniser un nœud complet Ethereum, un nœud complet L2, et calculer lui-même la transaction suspecte.\n\nDans le pire des cas, un utilisateur n'aurait qu'à synchroniser un nœud complet Ethereum pour vérifier la preuve de validité, s'épargnant ainsi la charge de calcul.\n\nContrairement aux Validity Rollups, le coût des Optimistic Rollups s'échelonne linéairement avec le nombre de transactions au lieu du nombre d'utilisateurs, ce qui les rend plus chers.\n\n### **Dernière pièce du puzzle - Accès permissionless à l'état du rollup**\n\nPour garantir la validité des transactions, les utilisateurs doivent exécuter un nœud Ethereum uniquement. Cependant, les utilisateurs et les développeurs peuvent vouloir voir, et exécuter, l'état et l'exécution du Rollup à diverses fins. Un nœud L2 d'indexation répond parfaitement à ce besoin. Non seulement il permet aux utilisateurs de voir les transactions dans le réseau, mais il s'agit également d'une pièce essentielle nécessaire au fonctionnement de l'infrastructure de l'écosystème. Les indexeurs comme The Graph, Alchemy, Infura, les réseaux Oracle comme Chainlink, et les explorateurs de blocs, tous sont entièrement pris en charge par un nœud L2 d'indexation permissionless.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDe nombreuses approches pour aborder la scalabilité des blockchains se concentrent à tort sur l'augmentation du débit.

{"id": "rPBNfJQ1QAgTwWJsofVA7RXpd3zI1Z9Z64Nb5lmh4Qk", "title": "Can roast + complaining solve the problem? CBA signboards need to be jointly maintained", "body": "In the ninth round of CBA League, in a focus duel between Liaoning and Shanxi, the scores of the two teams have been completely opened in the second half, and the game has lost suspense early. However, Guo Allen, a player of Liaoning team, complained that the referee was expelled after an attack, which has become the focus of the game.\n\nAfter the game, Guo Allen directly made a comment on social media, “I can’t understand. It’s a joke. I’ll play games. Bye.”\n\nComments about referees and players spread all over the comment area. Soon after, the topic of “Guo Allen was expelled” rushed to the microblog hot search, and it still topped the list hot search this morning. It can be seen that everyone’s attention to this matter is far more than the game itself.\n\nFrom the perspective of slow motion, Aaron Guo’s layup was indeed suspected of being violated, but the referee could not guarantee that every penalty would be foolproof for other objective reasons such as angle on the court. We can only maximize the fairness of the players of the two teams, not to mention the uncertainty of competitive sports is also an attractive factor.\n\nOf course, Aaron Guo’s complaint has his reasons, but his improper speech directly led him to two consecutive technical fouls and was finally expelled. For Guo Allen, it’s natural that some dumb people have a hard feeling of eating Coptis chinensis. They themselves suffer a loss. They find the referee to reason, but they suffer again.\n\nAs a player, respect the rules and face up to the problems. Even if you suffer a loss on the court, you can go through the appeal channel and ask the relevant departments to watch the video. If you compete directly with the referee on the court, the irrational athlete will naturally become the object of punishment. He will be wronged himself, which will only make him more embarrassed.\n\nAfter Aaron Guo was expelled, I believe the CBA alliance will not turn a blind eye to his words on social media. According to the ticket issued by CBA League this season, Aaron Guo may be fined or even suspended.\n\nIn the match between Guangzhou and Jilin this week, Guangzhou head coach Guo Shiqiang was directly suspended for five games and fined 20000 yuan because he complained about the referee and made a scene on the technical stage. Zhao Rui was suspended for one match and fined 50000 yuan for judging with his fingers and using insulting language. These two tickets related to referees can be seen from a certain extent that the CBA alliance is protecting referees and strictly implementing the rules. Of course, the protection of referees is not biased. There are major omissions and misjudgments, and CBA also has a corresponding punishment mechanism for referees. For example, the referees and technical representatives of law enforcement Guangzhou and Jilin have been criticized internally, and there is even news that they have been suspended.\n\nAlthough referees often become the object of roast, people should communicate or appeal in appropriate ways. Blindly pushing the referee to the commanding height of public opinion will only make everyone watch the game with colored glasses and can’t appreciate the charm of competitive sports itself.\n\nOf course, the remarks made by Liaoning team head coach Yang Ming at the post game press conference are worth praising for him. As the coach of the team and the coach of Aaron Guo, he apologized to the outside world for his players in front of the media. “The only deficiency is that Allen apologized to everyone and the referee through the media lens. (Guo Allen) the team will summarize the complaints about the referee’s decision, and strive for the coaching team to master the field environment and the scale of the referee’s decision in the future, so as not to make similar mistakes.” Yang Ming’s remarks set a good example for the whole team and even the whole league.\n\nUnder the background of the epidemic, CBA League has always been forging ahead and continuing the closed management of the tournament system. It is very difficult for 20 teams, including the referees. When the CBA League is in trouble, we need to work together to maintain the image of the league. Superstars, CBA League and fans are duty bound to work together to overcome difficulties and create a better environment for the CBA League.", "timestamp": 1653241471, "digest": "MvchtL0K7JdHYg3PAiFK7SvGq73X2FUulwe2RNjuTzA", "contributor": "0x2eC42C830Ed1356983C3818DFf57B51C4b60bbe9"}
{"id": "3uEv8Ewj-PG7gJasmJ0aBy1LiK0YG2F2CL1BVDCPm1E", "title": "The auto market falls into recession, and the repair must grasp three key points", "body": "The supply chain crisis, accompanied by the conversion of popular models, jointly led to the decline of the car market in early 2022. After the market has identified the new hot spot of “new energy + economic models”, whether several star products can be born in the second quarter to stimulate the rapid recovery of the market has become the key to whether China’s auto market can maintain growth or at least avoid a serious recession in 2022.\n\nWen Yinlu editor mark\n\nThe passenger car market joint conference (hereinafter referred to as the passenger car Association), China Automobile Industry Association and China Automobile Circulation Association have successively released the key operation data of China’s automobile market in April 2022 in the past few days. The data performance is expected to be very depressed. In addition, more than expected, not only the production end is seriously damaged, but also the sales end data is obviously weak, and the production and sales ends are under pressure. The second quarter of this year has become a key window period for the repair of the automobile market.\n\nAfter in-depth communication with many OEMs and dealers, Caijing eleven believes that there are three key points to repair the car market:\n\n 1. Dredge the capillaries of the supply chain.\n 2. 2. It is urgent to bail out dealers.\n 3. 3. The integration of car enterprises follows the hot spot transformation of the car market.\n 4. Supply chain repair more difficult than expected\n 5. The impact of this round of epidemic on automobile production is comparable to that when the epidemic just broke out in 2020. According to the data released by the passenger Federation, 969000 passenger cars were produced in April, down 41.1% year-on-year and 46.8% month on month, which is under great pressure. The last time the monthly output of passenger cars was less than one million was in February and March 2020, 208000 and 975000 respectively.\n 6. The decline rates of production at different levels are as follows: luxury brands decreased by 57% year-on-year and 43% month on month; Joint venture brands decreased by 56% year-on-year and 58% month on month; Independent brands decreased by 20% year-on-year and 38% month on month. The biggest reason for the decline of joint venture brands is that many car companies are located in Shanghai and Changchun, which are seriously affected by the epidemic. In April, the production of five major automobile enterprises in Shanghai decreased by 75% month on month compared with March, the production of joint venture major automobile enterprises in Changchun decreased by 54% month on month, and the overall decline in other regions was 38%.\n 7. The supply chain crisis has led to more than one million production cuts. After entering may, although the situation has improved, the impact is still not optimistic. Changchun has basically completed the restoration of production order, but there are many difficulties in resuming production in Shanghai. The automobile supply chain is very long. It is difficult to cover all key enterprises in the supply chain through the permission of the white list.\n 8. Chen Yudong, President of Bosch China, said that although the two batches of white lists released in Shanghai have covered more than 2000 enterprises, and most of the first-class suppliers of Bosch and Bosch are in the “white list”, the suppliers of Bosch suppliers are not necessarily in the “white list”, and the supply chain cannot form a chain, so products cannot be produced in the end.\n 9. For example, Chen Yudong said, “we have a coating supplier. The company is in Shanghai and the scale is very small. In this case, it is difficult to resume work, but if the supplier does not resume work, it will affect the production of the whole chain. In the later stage, we also helped the company resume work through various coordination.”\n10. The madness of competing for upstream supply is also affecting the progress of resumption of production. At present, the supply capacity of upstream suppliers is very limited. When competing for the supply of goods, there are even buyers blocking the door with cash. As long as there are goods, the buyer will take care of them all. This gave birth to a phenomenon. One of the two enterprises grabbed part a and the other grabbed Part B. as a result, the two enterprises didn’t spend less money, but the parts were still incomplete and could not resume production smoothly.\n11. Logistics and accessories are the two major problems faced by the current auto enterprises. If these problems are not solved, even if the workers can return to their posts smoothly, they will face the situation of no work to start. From April 18 to the end of the month, there are 11 working days. SAIC passenger car port base produced more than 2400 vehicles in April and Tesla produced 10757 vehicles in April, both of which are less than half of the normal production capacity. Chen Yudong also confirmed that although Bosch’s factories are in production and operation, the degree of capacity recovery is not optimistic. On the whole, the degree of capacity recovery is about 30% - 75%.\n12. Although the repair road of the whole automobile supply chain is blocked and long, the trend is obviously improving. Cui Dongshu, Secretary General of the Federation, revealed at the sales data release and communication meeting on May 10 that the delivery data in the first week of May had been significantly improved compared with the last week of April. With the continuous improvement of epidemic control in Shanghai, the repair of supply chain will be significantly accelerated. At present, compared with the difficulties of vehicle manufacturers, the plight of dealers in direct contact with consumers needs more attention.\n13. Dealers are more difficult than vehicle manufacturers\n14. The difficulties of vehicle manufacturers have become the focus of the whole society, but the difficulties of dealers have not been paid enough attention. According to the data released by China Automobile Circulation Association, among the 94 City samples surveyed, dealers in 34 cities have closed their stores due to epidemic prevention and control, mostly in first tier cities. More than 60% of the dealers who closed their stores for more than a week. Most dealers said they could not complete the sales task of the current month. More than 70% of dealers with a completion rate of less than 70% and more than 40% of dealers with a completion rate of less than half. At present, some car enterprises have reduced the task assessment indicators for dealers.\n15. Key data reflect the severity of the problem. At present, the dealer’s inventory coefficient (inventory coefficient = ending inventory / current sales volume) is 1.91, which is the highest value since March 2020. From February to April this year, the inventory coefficients are 1.85, 1.75 and 1.91 respectively, significantly exceeding the boom and bust line of 1.50, and increasing year-on-year for three consecutive months.\n16. Source: China Automobile Circulation Association\n17. According to the analysis of the passenger Association, the proportion of in transit inventory has increased, and the production of some popular models is in shortage, resulting in the mismatch of supply and demand structure and great difficulty in adjustment; The lack of retail increment of popular models also makes the inventory coefficient falsely high.\n18. However, the false high coefficient does not mean that the damage to dealers is false. The dealer inventory early warning index released by China Automobile Circulation Association in April was 66.4%, while the rise and fall line of this index was 50%. The early warning index in April was the highest value since February 2020, and the early warning index has risen continuously since February 2022. Unlike the inventory coefficient, which only calculates a single index, the early warning index integrates the total demand of the automobile market, the customer volume of 4S stores, the transaction rate, price changes and sales changes\n19.

The community can create any World that can be prototyped.**\n\nThe idea that web3 can inform the design of a better tomorrow, and that the Web3 community is a disrupting force that can provoke better societies into existence is a powerful one to explore, envision, and question. If proven true then it is a movement.\n\n**Web3 systems can provoke themselves into existence**\n\n\"Web3 has stunned the world by forging a parallel system of finance of unprecedented flexibility and creativity in less than a decade.\" This demonstrates that within the online bubble of the internet \"Web3 systems can provoke themselves into existence\". This is largely true because social consensus and economic incentives are embedded into their design and enforced at deployment. \n\n**Can we design and build cyber-physical systems to capitalize on the promise of Web3 and provoke a better future?**\n\nThis promising transformational power, if indeed exists, remains unused in large-scale constructs that bridge the cyber and physical worlds such as private cities, because it is too complex and daunting for anyone to tackle alone. \n\nIn one aspect this is because web3 technology is a stack of abstract protocols that makes it very difficult for technical and non-technical users to imagine future realities and alternative worlds that may become available to us by hierarchical assemblies of lego-code blocks. \n\n**Is there a need for a decentralized agency to design, research, and prototype future realities?**\n\nIn this era of unprecedented change, no single team or organization can begin to design unexpected solutions that disrupt conventional thinking without deep collaboration between ecosystem players, communities, and local governance. The fact that there is no easy way to imagine future worlds build with this futuristic technologies, the uncertainty, and other factors are limiting the potential of society to use Web3 in full force. As an example we bring the potential of a Web3 city of 5 M people that could generate an annual product of five hundred Million Ether the equivalent of one Trillion USD.\n\n**Why the Web3 community needs World Building Prototyping?**\n\nWeb3 Synthetic Worlds provides the opportunity for a unique and unparallel experimental environment to: design, prototype, and test complex \\[socio-economic and political \\] systems of regional scale. In doing so, they allow us to not just tinker with the status quo, but to dismantle it and build something better in its place. \n\nBy prototyping projective futures we can show people that other realities are possible and that web3 can help us get there. If we can show that web3 can help to create a brighter future and we map the path to it, many of us will all rush towards that outcome. \n\n**What kind of a decentralized design agency do we imagine?**\n\nThis design initiative finds it attractive to follow an approach modeled as an agency that works on behalf of the Web3 community and ecosystem to help envision the potential of Web3 to its fullest extent through prototyping new worlds that we haven't seen before. This d.agency, is coming together to work with the community to drive the future of Web3 and help put the community at the center of this movement. \n\nThe success of this experiment is based on our ability to create value for citizens and society. Providing a way to align incentives to attract participation and share the benefits of future outcomes is central to our vision for fairness and justice.\n\n\\[This is a draft, a living document.

This is because all hardware wallets that require signing of transactions would have to be compromised *simultaneously* in order for an attacker to steal the funds, which would be extremely hard to do if you use hardware wallets from different vendors.\n\n正如 Michael Flaxman 在此[播客](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/97/)中所提到的，多重簽名錢包中每增加一個簽名者，安全性就會提高一個等級，即使增加的簽名方是閉源硬件錢包。因為如果攻擊著想要攻擊一筆多簽交易，他就必須攻擊所有參與簽名的硬件錢包。如果您使用的是來自不同供應商的硬件錢包，那這種情況將難以實現。\n\n目前，我們以經完成了與 [Gnosis Safe](https://support.keyst.one/3rd-party-wallets/defi-dapp-with-keystone/gnosis-safe)、 [Blue Wallet](https://support.keyst.one/v/traditional-chinese/di-san-fang-qian-bao/bi-te-bi-qian-bao/bluewallet)、[Spectre](https://support.keyst.one/v/traditional-chinese/di-san-fang-qian-bao/bi-te-bi-qian-bao/specter)、[Wasabi Wallet](https://support.keyst.one/v/traditional-chinese/di-san-fang-qian-bao/bi-te-bi-qian-bao/wasabi)、[Sparrow](https://support.keyst.one/v/traditional-chinese/di-san-fang-qian-bao/bi-te-bi-qian-bao/sparrow)、[BTCPay Server](https://support.keyst.one/v/traditional-chinese/di-san-fang-qian-bao/bi-te-bi-qian-bao/btcpay-server)、[Electrum Wallet](https://support.keyst.one/v/traditional-chinese/di-san-fang-qian-bao/bi-te-bi-qian-bao/electrum)、Fully Noded 等多個數字貨幣錢包的兼容，並且支持 PSBT 多重簽名。多重簽名被認為是安全儲存數字貨幣的[最佳選擇](https://twitter.com/mflaxman/status/1310580116808970240)，用戶可以使用 Keystone 硬件錢包作為簽名者創建多重簽名錢包，以此驗證未簽名的多重簽名交易。您可以在[本文](https://medium.com/shiftcrypto/the-pitfalls-of-multisig-when-using-hardware-wallets-9b0e98e4c19c)中查看此功能的重要性。\n\n## 下一步計畫\n\n目前，為了防止網絡釣魚攻擊，Keystone 僅允許用戶通過簽名的固件包進行升級， Ledger、Trezor 和 Keepkey 用戶最近都成為網絡釣魚攻擊的受害者。所以只是單單提醒用戶謹慎安裝第三方固件不足以應對威脅，因為並非所有用戶都具備必要的背景知識，能意識到固件升級過程中潛在的網絡攻擊。\n\n僅允許由我們簽署的固件包進行升級確實防範了大量網絡攻擊，但也有缺點，那就是用戶必須信任我們發布的固件升級包。為了減小這種信任，並滿足那些想要自定義固件的高級用戶，我們未來會發布 Cypherpunk 版本的 Keystone，這個版本的 Keystone 不再預裝任何固件，因此用戶必須編譯自己的固件，在 Github 上選擇可用的私鑰進行簽名，並且，用戶可以自行替換升級包校驗的秘鑰對，從而只識別用戶自行簽名的升級包。\n\n作為目前區塊鏈社區中支持[多重簽名這一最佳解決方案](https://twitter.com/mflaxman/status/1310580116808970240)的一員，我們非常自豪地告訴大家，我們與 [Nunchuk](https://nunchuk.io/)、[ColdCard](https://coldcard.com/) 和 [BitBox](https://shiftcrypto.ch/) 的開發人員一起起草了 [BIP129](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0129.mediawiki)（比特幣安全多重簽名設置，BSMS ）。該 BIP 將比特幣多重簽名的安全性，提升到了一個全新的水平。不久的將來，我們也將實施此 BIP 準則。\n\n# 羅馬不是一天建成的\n\n關於開源，我們為什麼要一步一步實現？有這樣幾個原因。首先，我們有責任保護我們的用戶免受日益增加的黑客攻擊，而將代碼開源的同時也將暴露漏洞，行業內有一句話：「security through obscurity」。所以，Keystone 硬件錢包開源的同時也產生了新的潛在威脅。我們需要執行更嚴格的代碼標準，對這些漏洞進行分析修復，然後才能發布。\n\n世界上沒有絕對的事情，也沒有任何電子產品永遠是完全透明100%開源的，但開源對區塊鏈社區來說仍然非常重要。開源代碼不僅使內部工程師作惡變得更加困難，而且還能促進硬件錢包與軟件錢包等其他產品的集成。現在我們的產品與其他軟件錢包的兼容性越來越高，這也是我們理應為比特幣社區做出的貢獻，同時這也有助於減少用戶對我們產品的信任依賴。", "timestamp": 1653241826, "digest": "iLJF6Da4LgtnfdhIyWtNW67rEij1ld6pwxItNlN9_6w", "contributor": "0xaFEF3a80B6A205d1F74aaC7887e96A0F6F6051e0"}

Zhuang Guotai, Secretary of the Party group and director of the China Meteorological Administration, put forward clear requirements for strengthening meteorological disaster monitoring and early warning and cooperating with relevant departments to do a good job in disaster prevention and reduction. Yu Yong, member of the Party group and deputy director of the Bureau, deployed the next work.\n\nThe meeting pointed out that the China Meteorological Administration attached great importance to the strongest precipitation process in the South since the flood season. Local meteorological support services continued to follow up and took strong actions, showing a good trend of early prediction, early service, good linkage and good effect. Meteorological departments at all levels should implement the concept of “people first and life first”, continue to cooperate with relevant departments to do a good job, and earnestly build the first line of defense for meteorological disaster prevention and reduction.\n\nThe meeting made arrangements for the next work:\n\nFirst, we should strengthen monitoring, forecasting and early warning services. The heavy precipitation process is still continuing and is in the critical period of defense. Meteorological departments at all levels should continue to maintain the combat state, make persistent efforts, strengthen rolling monitoring, consultation, research and judgment, give full play to the advantages of modern meteorological monitoring means, strengthen short-term approach prediction, and go all out to provide monitoring and prediction services.\n\nSecond, service tips should be provided for possible subsequent secondary disasters. The precipitation lasts for a long time. We should pay close attention to the secondary disasters that may induce mountain torrents, geological disasters and other disasters, as well as the disaster risks such as over alarm of small and medium-sized rivers and waterlogging in urban and rural areas, and timely follow up and optimize the service tips.\n\nThird, we should continue to strengthen information submission and public science popularization. Fully understand the importance of all parties to the heavy precipitation process, timely and authoritative release of meteorological monitoring actual information and rolling forecast and early warning, strengthen close cooperation with relevant departments, timely report to Party committees and governments at all levels, timely inform the public and popularize science.\n\nFourth, we should make an overall plan for the current cold air in the north and heavy rainfall in the south. At present, the process of cold air in the north is extreme. In particular, it is necessary to strengthen the analysis of the impact of cold air on epidemic prevention and control and agricultural production, and provide targeted decision-making services by comparing historical data with big data. The South should beware of secondary disasters that may be induced by early precipitation accumulation.", "timestamp": 1653242336, "digest": "8tkoBLJtPE_0rze45uBwUt3Dz1EvGQ0Fic_Gzm4yThQ", "contributor": "0xeb948025a9113a2390E01a455Fda18B2D425254B"}

The big publishing platforms and leading influencers control most of the traffic which allows them to charge exorbitant pay-to-be-seen fees. This and other supporting factors, especially the drive to boost revenue by publishing a lot of content, result in a prohibitively over-priced and over-crowded innovation showcase stage that favors the rich and savvy over the viable, technologically-sound and value-adding. It is like looking for someone you haven’t met yet, in a dark and noisy nightclub with a high probability they didn’t even clear the bouncer…\n\n# Mission — Marco! Polo!\n\nOrchestra’s mission is to help all interested parties in the Crypto/web3 innovation space to find each other on a level playing field.\n\n# Strategy — Come together\n\n![Come together](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z546IYK0oa5WrqwBNjuFt.png?height=787&width=1400)\n\nWe’ll do this by both removing obstacles and by paving inroads.\n\nIn removing obstacles we mean getting rid of the “noise” created by the current unnatural selection process, i.e., merit-centric curation of strong and reputable pool of Good Innovation Projects (GIPs). In “paving inroads” we mean providing a communal virtual space and conditions that would foster interactions with and in a community of innovation supporters (e.g., investors, partners, OGs, KOLs, journalists, publishers, influencers, and other interested parties we can’t think of right now).\n\nAs can be inferred, we believe that collaboration is a necessary condition for effective innovation. We also believe that given the right conditions, collaboration happens naturally. What we mean is that if we are able to bring people together in a way that provides a good match in terms of resources, needs and mutual interests, they will do the rest on their own.\n\n# Organization — Orchestra is a {Set}\n\nOrchestra is not a website (mobile or otherwise), not a Discord channel (nor Telegram group or any other social platform collective noun), not a platform, not a company, an association or any other legal entity. Orchestra will most probably include some or all of the objects above. However, Orchestra is not defined by any of them.\n\nOrchestra is an organization. In “organization” we mean that it is a set of people that 1) identify as belonging to that set, and 2) are accepted by (enough) other members of the set as belonging to that set, and 3) that act in a way that affects other members of the set. The source of the sense of belonging in our case stems from a shared purpose.

How to make up for it?", "body": "Xinhua news agency, Beijing, May 12 - question: what are the shortcomings of flood control since the strongest rainfall this year? How to make up for it?\n\nXinhua News Agency reporter\n\nAt 18:00 on the 11th, the Central Meteorological Observatory issued the first orange rainstorm warning this year, suggesting that many provinces in southern China will usher in heavy rain, and there will be heavy rain in some areas. It is reported that this is the strongest rainfall since the flood season in the south. What are the shortcomings of flood control in China? How to make up the local short board? Xinhua News Agency reporters conducted interviews in many places.\n\nThe flood control situation is still grim\n\nIn recent days, Guo Jianliang, director of the office of the flood control and drought relief headquarters in Nanxian County, Yiyang City, Hunan Province, has been busy. He should not only organize flood fighting and rescue training, but also arrange personnel to keep an eye on the changes of the flood situation. Once the water situation is severe, he should also organize personnel to patrol the embankment for danger investigation. He told reporters: “Dongting Lake area is the ‘main battlefield’ for flood control and flood fighting. After entering the flood season, we are highly nervous.”\n\nAccording to the analysis and prediction from meteorological and hydrological departments, the flood control situation in many places this year is relatively severe.\n\nMa Jianhua, executive deputy commander-in-chief of the Yangtze River flood control and Drought Relief Headquarters, said that it is predicted that the precipitation in the flood season of the Yangtze River Basin this year is normal and less, but the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation is extremely uneven, the risk of regional floods in the upstream is high, the probability of drought and water shortage in the middle and lower reaches is high, and the possibility of drought and flood coexisting is high.\n\n“Flood risk is still the biggest threat to the Yellow River Basin this year.” Wang Annan, executive deputy commander-in-chief of the Yellow River flood control and Drought Relief Headquarters, said. The prediction and analysis data show that there is more precipitation in the Yellow River Basin this summer. Among them, the precipitation in the north of Hetao is close to the whole year, the precipitation in the South and lower reaches of the middle reaches is 20-40% more, and that in other areas is less than 20%. It is reported that most of the areas with excessive rainfall forecast are the main source areas of flood and sediment caused by the Yellow River. Once a large flood is formed, both water and sediment will fall, making it very difficult to defend. In addition, with the increasing impact of global climate change in recent years and the further increase of flood disaster risk in the Yellow River Basin, the flood control situation of the Yellow River this year is still grim.\n\nThere are multiple short boards in flood control\n\nMa Jianhua said: “at present, the flood control and disaster reduction capacity of the Yangtze River Basin has been significantly improved, but the weak links are still prominent. It will take a long time to improve the flood control and disaster reduction system.”\n\nThe shortage of manpower and great financial pressure have been the short board of flood control in various places for many years. Huarong County, Yueyang City, Hunan Province, is known as “standing on the Yangtze River and stepping on the Dongting”. The first-line flood control dike is 325km long, accounting for about 10% of the total length of the first-line flood control dike in Hunan Province. Wang Zhong, deputy director of Huarong County Water Conservancy Bureau, introduced that Dongting Lake area is the main agricultural production area. A large number of young and strong labor force go out to work, and the left behind personnel are difficult to bear the heavy flood control work. Cadres in Henan, Hubei and other places also reported that the shortage of flood control manpower means that investment should be increased. At the same time, some water conservancy facilities also need to be improved, and local financial pressure is also great.\n\nThe 2022 Yellow River flood control and drought relief work conference revealed that there are many weak links in the flood control engineering system of the Yellow River Basin. Including the low embankment standard of some sections of the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the flood control project in the middle reaches has not yet formed a system, and the downstream “secondary suspended river” channel shape, wandering channel and “moving bed” situation exacerbate the flood risk. “The river conditions in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, with high hanging rivers, wide beaches and many people, and the coexistence of flood and sediment, have not changed, and the situation is still grim,” Wang Annan said\n\nUrban flood control also faces multiple weaknesses. Yuan Zhenlong, director of the Institute of comprehensive management of the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, said that many old urban areas lack the overall planning of flood control functions in the early stage of construction, or the planning is not scientific and accurate enough, the building density in the central urban area is high, and the flood control standards of bungalow areas and old residential areas are low, which makes these areas easy to become weak links of urban flood control. “In some areas, rivers, wetlands and depressions have been occupied, and the urban water storage space is narrow, which can not give full play to the water storage function when the rainstorm comes.” Yuan Zhenlong said.\n\nStrong ability, build team and make up for weaknesses\n\nRecently, in some concave bridge areas in Beijing, the staff of Beijing Drainage Group are installing surveillance cameras to monitor the ponding in the bridge area in real time during the flood season, so as to find the ponding in time and dispose it quickly.\n\nBeijing Drainage Group has increased the total pumping capacity of 88 rainwater pump stations of the group to 750000 cubic meters per hour since 2013. “Last year, we further improved emergency rescue equipment, with a total emergency rescue capacity of 205000 cubic meters per hour, an increase of 17 times compared with 2011.” Beijing Drainage Group official said.\n\nIn rural areas, all localities try their best to make up for the shortcomings of flood control and emergency response capacity by strengthening real-time monitoring, information construction and establishing professional teams. Huarong County investigated the rural young and middle-aged labor force at home before the flood season, organized 17453 assault and patrol personnel and registered them, and established a 100 person county-level flood control emergency rescue militia company and an 80 person County rescue emergency engineering team. “Putting the work ahead avoids the difficulty of organizing temporary personnel.” Wang Zhong told reporters.\n\n“The accumulated rainfall of Xuanmiaoguan reservoir has exceeded 100 mm. We must increase patrols and pay attention to prevent mountain torrents and landslides.” Recently, with the continuous rainfall, Chen Jiangling, a government worker in Leizu Town, Yuan’an County, Yichang City, Hubei Province, received a number of messages on her mobile phone.\n\nThe situation of rainwater in mountainous areas is relatively complex, and people live scattered. According to chenjiangling, a monitoring cloud platform has been established locally, so that the rain information can be monitored in real time, and can be seen at a glance on the platform. Then, the disaster early warning information can be timely released to flood control personnel and people in flood threatened areas through various media such as mobile phone short message platform, wechat official account and video number.\n\n“For the 63 hidden geological hazards identified, we not only put forward preventive and rectification measures, but also establish an on-site inspection mechanism. In case of flood, village cadres and emergency team members will be required to dispatch quickly for emergency disposal to ensure that the hidden risks are controlled and build a safety screen for the people.” Chen Jiangling said.

Ziwei celebrates after the game on July 2. On February 7, Ren Ziwei won the men’s 1000m short track speed skating final of this winter Olympic Games and became the first “double gold” winner of the Chinese ice and snow corps at this winter Olympic Games. “The students I took have won various awards, but I have a dream that has not come true. That is, no child has won the Olympic champion yet.” Two years ago, Wang Beiming, Ren Ziwei’s Enlightenment coach, expressed this regret in a conversation with Ren Ziwei. At that time, Ren Ziwei said with determination that he was confident to help the teacher realize this dream. In 2010, Ren Ziwei suffered an accidental fracture during the competition. At that time, Ren Ziwei’s mother didn’t want him to continue training, so Wang Beiming personally communicated with his parents. Later, Wang Beiming went to work for Ren Ziwei and asked him if he liked the sport and whether he wanted to continue practicing. He replied that he still wanted to, but his parents disagreed. “Miss Wang, do you think I’m ok?” Ren Ziwei was very confused at that time. Wang Beiming replied, “if you say you can, I’ll say you can. If you say you can’t, I’ll say you can’t.” Ren Ziwei said he would do it. Wang Beiming led Ren Ziwei to train for 10 years and witnessed Ren Ziwei grow from a child to the provincial team and national team, and then to win two gold medals in the Beijing Winter Olympics. Ren Ziwei is still expected to win the gold medal in the next two events of the men’s 500 meter relay and the men’s 5000 meter relay in the Winter Olympics.", "timestamp": 1653242497, "digest": "0J84WDUaqTDQdxrjeobNOzYhzDq5NEEA7e1yyGiUlMU", "contributor": "0x4fd71871D9FA215D255E2297B5aB0C8e756e7Dc7"}

If you're not happy with something, change it. Everything is in our minds; if you can change your mind, you will be able to change your reality.\n\nDo not accept things for the sake of it. Question why things should be that way and how you could make them different. At the end of the day, the only thing that matters is you. If I were you, I would make myself the number one priority.\n\nYour happiness is yours. Luckily being happy, you can make others happy. If life is a game, we should have fun playing it. If we decide to suffer, let it be for something worth it.\n\nWhy wait so long to do something you want to do? How many people have ended up doing nothing? Nothing in life is permanent. The only thing that will be permanent for the course of your life is you. So fall in love with yourself since it's the only permanent thing.\n\nPeople come and go, thoughts and emotions come and go, and nothing stays put. The only thing that comes and goes is time. Time passes but never returns. Every second that passes is one second closer to death. Make your time the most important asset you have. Learn to spend it. There is nothing more valuable than time.\n\nLove with all your being, do not shy away from loving. Loving is our nature. No one should prevent you from living. Learn to love; if I were you, I would start with myself. Loving yourself is the most extraordinary act of love you will do in your life. The moment you learn to love yourself, you will be reborn.\n\nLife is simple; our human mind complicates it. We spend so much time wanting things, aching for those things, and so little time appreciating what we already have. Be thankful for everything you have, and being alive is more than enough to feel grateful.\n\nThis message is for whoever, wherever, and whenever.

We all have different ways of feeling loved and wanted.\n\nRest assured that life will be whatever you want it to be. Figure out what you want your life to be.

The language system features a complex of 3D animation, typographic design, abstracted linguistics, Rorschach style inkblots, and procedural monochromatic animations.\n\nThe exhibition’s visual language was the result of over a year's worth of research and development.\n\n> “The approach we took with BAB was essentially linguistic and architectural, having an evocative language as the center of the system made it easy to sculpt around the pieces.” - Moustafa Hassan\n\nThe second output of the project’s research was utilizing B.A.B’s language system in the creation of an interactive care plan designed by web3 smart company m3ga.\n\n> “We wanted to reexamine how a research study engages with black audiences. Typically most studies are uninformed, cultural discordant and just straight boring. Therefore we wanted to tap into mimetics as a pathway to really connect with people using a shared language.” - Gregory Ketant\n\nDeveloped using the [VideoAsk](https://m3ga.world/) platform, the interactive care plan featured response choices such as conditional logic, multiple response options, & contact forms to make the conversation and community building seamless. The diversity in response types allowed the project to think more interpersonally when developing the prompts for the survey.\n\nThe interactive care plan aims to gather the measurable effects of systematic race-related trauma that black artists experience.

Therefore we have decided to leverage the power of web3 to metastasize the exhibition into a DAO; **ghost**DAO.\n\nThe structure of **ghost**DAO is inspired by the utility found in temporary or transitional architecture. Temporary architecture provides a framework for research and experimentation, allowing architects to present their visions on an international stage, with the aim of advancing practice and stimulating innovation.\n\n> Temporary architecture is a fertile ground for testing ideas, examining places, and popularizing new concepts and technologies.\n\nThis architectural framework serves as the conceptual basis for **ghost**DAO; a DAO purposely built for experimentation, examining new practices, and processes for identifying burnout for black artists as well as introducing new concepts in mental health advocacy, innovative treatment & more activities.\n\nOnce our stated goals are met, the **ghost**DAO will dissolve leaving behind all of the research, development, data, and documentation available to the artist community, on-chain.

{"id": "7DflQJiwi4Qojf0NfxtGeFDzY0iGM49UdicXcwqRqeE", "title": "How we found our Teddy :)", "body": "Last summer Sam FaceTime'd me & was talking to me about NFT’s. I knew what NFT’s were before we had that conversation but just never paid attention to it. He said : bro this space is perfect for you, don’t ask me why just go on twitter & join any NFT twitter space and you’ll find your journey, I am so excited to see where this story goes from here…\n\nI still remember saying : bro it’s 4 in the morning rn on a Saturday night and you’re telling me to go on twitter space rn and follow some monkey’s??? lol\n\nIn my mind I was like this dude’s lit & out of his right frame of mind. Finishing our sentences he said Teddy trust me, I know you and I am telling you this is a one way ticket to the life you have always dreamed but never lived and opportunities like this are very hard to find. I just laughed at it and I was like I’ll think about it and let you know…\n\nThen after a week I was playing soccer with Shadow in my backyard thinking about what Sam said the other day and the way he said it it was full of light. I could literally feel those good vibes. Btw Sam is a well known artist in the space, and now after spending all this time in this space I get it why he was hyper that day. Anyways, then I went on my twitter and switched my profile form private to public. I joined my first twitter space, It was with @NFTPrince & NFTsquirrels. Both are living legends and I respect them a lot. They shared tons of selfless advice to me on first day without even knowing who I was, what my real name is, or how I looked like. The knowledge was so valuable that basically I’ve never been rugged / scammed in this space till date. \n\nAfter spending some time in different spaces and observing how everything is working in this ecosystem, I focused on the fundamentals, the way people interact and react with certain things, what values they carried, and how do they find their feeling of importance. It was’nt very difficult for me to figure these things out because of my knowledge & experience with Social Media for over 5 years. I grew 36 million+ followers on Instagram via different entertainment pages and a network of over 250 million+ followers via networking in less than 6 months with just 2,000$ to start with from my college dorm.\n\nDuring that time Bored Ape’s were just flying and they still are but the vibes were immaculate last year you can’t deny that. I literally did a PHD on them and I was just astounded by their story but I was able to relate a lot of it to my life, it was so inspiring and fascinating. I was thinking so much about it, that even in my dreams I was seeing NFT’s all around me and my life changed the night of September 30 when i had that one lucid dream, I decided to do a project to share my story so that others can relate to it and be a part of it. \n\n( Note : This was’nt the main reason for me to do a NFT project. My main goal was and is still the same today that I want to leave this NFT space better than how I found it. )\n\nBack to the story, why Teddy? Well obviously. My friend’s call me Teddy and Teddies have been a part of everyone’s childhood and I believe people will hold on to that tradition forever. They provide us the comfort & companionship, a friend to talk to, and it’s not just kids who benefit from the positive effects of a comforting Teddy squeeze. Teddies are just universal and timeless.\n\nI put all of my traits and character and imagination’s in the art, from my expressions to the way I dress. Some of the assets are added for the aesthetics of the collection. I am not an artist but since I was the character I worked with few freelance artist’s to bring my idea on paper. They asked me for a sketch to give an idea of what I wanted and this is what I sent them lmao 😂😂😂😂😂😂\n\n![ That Yu-Gi-Oh and LV belt part has my heart lmaoooo😭😭😭. Tbh this image is still a lot better than my first one. Btw I am not rich lol, I don't have a AP watch or fancy items.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p7SJwXfpBXm-_G9fiTlu0.jpg?height=1280&width=960)\n\n![This looks decent lol. Lot better than what I came up with.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vxl5Z9dogU0G7wxHt-euI.png?height=1280&width=720)\n\n![That's me on the Left! Dw I am doxed to all our past holder's and lot of people in NFT space know me irl. My identity is just not public in the space atm. I'll reveal it when time is right.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CL1JyGEQS_ynX1v0M1WGn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nBack to the story, so once I got this I reached out to few professional artist’s in my network and I worked with multiple of them to find the perfect Teddy. We wanted to stick with 2D because 3D art is great but the market seemed to be doing well with 2D more than 3D collections. Ofcs art style isn’t the main reason for it but it does play a role. But then I am like let’s take the challenge and create something insane. During the time when I started the project, their were’nt any 3D project’s coming out just yet nor there were any noticeable Teddy Bear collections popping as long as I know. So then we decided to turn this into 3D. During this process one 3D artist reached out to me in my DM’s of one our meme page asking to collab, I am like okay cool lets give it a shot and see what you got. \n\n![This is what he came up with as base model. 💀💀💀](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FcshCcWqBzufElk9puKnW.png?height=772&width=778)\n\nYeah he just lost me on that base model. If ur surprised, I did’nt see this coming either, when I saw it for the first time I was out of words just like you are rn. I seriously had no comments on this image. So yeah I had to say no to that dude and look for another artist. The fact that people fake their LinkedIn and show you proof of work of other artist is just hilarious. So I asked one of my friend on telegram if he knew any artist to connect me and he did. \n\n![Idk tbh, it was just not it.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z3yiJzSTaGmqQdaHZroTJ.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nIt just did’nt feel right going with the full body at this point, gave pfp style a shot and see how it does. Initially the idea was, we will do pfp collection and in a seperate contract and we will give the holders full body version of their Teddy so they have both and can use it the way they like whether to animate or so with the source file…\n\n![I finally said yes to this one and made a deal with the artist and gave her an upfront amount for her time that we both agreed on. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ef-d0SnN5nrZH4EpHIfbn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThe decided to upfront because she told me she had financial instability and urgently need of money for rent and expenses so she would’nt be able to work full time on this project and it would take lot longer to complete the collection than what I was expecting. Plus I genuinely wanted to help her regardless of if she would work for the project or not due to her situation. \n\n![My mind, Her ability.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q7q8YdENYDP5zDlajLh05.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nWe decided to fully render and rigg the collection in the end after all the traits and assets are illustrated and confirmed so that their isn't any confusions and nothing is left out. But unfortunately when she submitted, the quality of collection turned out terrible atleast from my pov. I communicated it with our community and told them that ‘guys we do not have the collection fully rigged and its in between 2D and 3D so we would have to pause the project for now until we find another artist and see how things go from there’. \n\nBut then I was also out of funds because I put everything I had in the project initially. So I communicated this with the community in our discord and 34 people ended up minting 100 regardless of the situation. 10 were minted for team and 1 was minted by me personally to participate in the process just like any other member of community. They knew that mint had zero value and won’t have a secondary market value but yet they still supported. So that moment onwards my belief in the project became even stronger and quitting was never an option no matter what situation I go through. The collection won’t ever be revealed because I don’t believe in trying to sell some bullshit to people just to pocket some eth. In trying to sell NFT’s I am not going to sell my character, tf I look like? ZagaBond? There is a big fat difference between failing and abandoning your project. We don’t give up around here…This project is my dream and it like a child to me. I want to be the best out there in anything I do in life. Whether if it is playing soccer or anything that I hold dear too I give my absolute best to win. When I play soccer I don’t play to just participate I play to make difference, I play to dominate the field. \n\n[https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub](https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub)\n\nSo yeah that was my first failure in NFT space, I learned a lot from that failure. The most important thing was that when starting a business do everything you can to gather great people that have the same drive & BELIEVE IN YOUR VISION as you do. Because in the end all a business is a group of people dedicated to provide service or product to people. Take care of your team like your family & they’ll take care of your business & customers. \n\nThen after I did an outreach again and managed to find a team of 4 professional 3D artist’s. Their past ventures have involved working with brands like Puma, Bangs and Lulu Lemon. Their Identities are anon as they wish to keep it that way but I have confirmed the veracity of their credentials. When I presented this entire idea and vision of the collection to them, after hearing me they instantly said yes and told be that we believe in you and we’re gonna make the best collection of 2022. We started working on it the same day and even with this team, I worked 1 on 1 with the team over screen shares for every single trait’s and asset’s and outcomes are just fantastic. Look It does’nt matter what people think of it but we do believe it is one of the greatest NFT collections that will ever be deployed on Blockchain. We’ve put our blood, sweat and tears in this collection as a team day in and day out. The collection is timeless & it will age well I can make that one promise for sure. \n\n![This collection is dedicated to someone who does'nt need to own it. It's a dream come true. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wKl-h3xgt9G73xjvxW_7_.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThere is no bigger feeling than making your dream come true and the story will never have an end to be honest. I am just the captain of the boat as of now but at some point I want to hand the dream over to the community in a position that even if I am not present the story live forever as long as their is imagination left in this world. \n\nBig hug & Thank you for your time and consideration for reading this. I genuinely appreciate your presence here with all my heart.

Rather then fetishize black trauma, we utilized art as a device to create sustainable resistance measures to envisage better experiences for black artists.\n\n![3D Avatar: Khalid](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i2wksw2q9s53364/We%20Got%20You.gif?raw=1)\n\n## The Mission\n\nThe project’s fundamental objective is to raise awareness of the deleterious effects of burnout as it specifically relates to black artists. B.A.B provides visibility for an under-diagnosed issue and representation to better the landscape for those who deal with race-related trauma in the artist ecosystem.\n\n> B.A.B was commissioned by contemporary digital art and technology archive Rhizome, and co-presented with The New Museum.\n\n![3D Avatar: Kiyana](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bl1n6eoowrkzb7k/RHZ%20Transition.gif?raw=1)\n\nExamples of symptoms of burn-out for black artists:\n\n* Persistent penalization for speaking out against racist institutions leading to self-initiated deletion of social accounts\n* Emotional, mental, and psychological distress leading to prolonged hiatus, inconsistent engagement, and detachment from the artist community\n* Lack of interest to remain present due to low incentive; meaning lessened ability to maintain a quality standard of living from which most of one's time is invested\n\n> Burnout is categorized as a \"syndrome\" that results from \"chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed.” ([WHO International Disease Classification CD-11](https://www.who.int/news/item/28-05-2019-burn-out-an-occupational-phenomenon-international-classification-of-diseases)).\n\n## Folk • Tech: Interactive Care Plan\n\n![Left to Right: Lizz, Nuenoto, Max](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c76ru71k9k5z3tu/Cereal%20Box.gif?raw=1)\n\nA critical innovation in B.A.B’s development is the exhibition’s visual language. The language system features a complex of 3D animation, typographic design, abstracted linguistics, Rorschach style inkblots, and procedural monochromatic animations.\n\nThe exhibition’s visual language was the result of over a year's worth of research and development.\n\n> “The approach we took with BAB was essentially linguistic and architectural, having an evocative language as the center of the system made it easy to sculpt around the pieces.” - Moustafa Hassan\n\nThe second output of the project’s research was utilizing B.A.B’s language system in the creation of an interactive care plan designed by web3 smart company m3ga.\n\n> “We wanted to reexamine how a research study engages with black audiences. Typically most studies are uninformed, cultural discordant and just straight boring. Therefore we wanted to tap into mimetics as a pathway to really connect with people using a shared language.” - Gregory Ketant\n\nDeveloped using the [VideoAsk](https://m3ga.world/) platform, the interactive care plan featured response choices such as conditional logic, multiple response options, & contact forms to make the conversation and community building seamless. The diversity in response types allowed the project to think more interpersonally when developing the prompts for the survey.\n\nThe interactive care plan aims to gather the measurable effects of systematic race-related trauma that black artists experience. The goal is to see how the interpretation of the information provided can guide a larger community towards finding solutions around inequity and harm reduction that produce observable results.\n\n![  “When we suffer in silence conditions for chronic stress are created. If left unaddressed and unresolved burnout occurs.”](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k7dbvi0lfxtsd72/Ink%20Transition.gif?raw=1)\n\n## Early Look at the Data\n\n[PSA 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC0xlB6KwD0)\n\nTo date, the interactive care plan has reached over 300+ impressions and generated over 100 conversations spanning 3 continents, 5 countries, and over a dozen cities.\n\nA snapshot of early statistics gathered from the study:\n\n* 63% of the respondents identify as black\n* 7% of the respondents identify as indigenous\n* 31% of the respondents identify as non-black / non-indigenous\n* 20% of respondents have completed the study\n* 34% of respondents have completed half of the study’s questions/prompts\n\nWe are currently coordinating outreach to connect respondents to provide any needed emotional or logistical support to finish the study.\n\n> **Note**: Anyone is invited to take part in the study however participants who identify as non-black / non-indigenous are considered a part of the control group data cohort.\n\n![Preview from the B.A.B collection that will be up for auction soon.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j5eG6uuKzS4GO07nuvhZv.png?height=3616&width=3616)\n\n![Prototype identity for ghostDAO](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E2A6N4LXv3z-jRNV7KZju.png?height=620&width=2126)\n\nDuring the development of the exhibition, we realized that B.A.B has an opportunity to make a much larger, sustainable impact beyond creating awareness of this underdiagnosed issue. We surmised that if the exhibition is already generating community-led conversations, as well as creating solutions, then B.A.B is already doing the work of an institution. Therefore we have decided to leverage the power of web3 to metastasize the exhibition into a DAO; **ghost**DAO.\n\nThe structure of **ghost**DAO is inspired by the utility found in temporary or transitional architecture. Temporary architecture provides a framework for research and experimentation, allowing architects to present their visions on an international stage, with the aim of advancing practice and stimulating innovation.\n\n> Temporary architecture is a fertile ground for testing ideas, examining places, and popularizing new concepts and technologies.\n\nThis architectural framework serves as the conceptual basis for **ghost**DAO; a DAO purposely built for experimentation, examining new practices, and processes for identifying burnout for black artists as well as introducing new concepts in mental health advocacy, innovative treatment & more activities.\n\nOnce our stated goals are met, the **ghost**DAO will dissolve leaving behind all of the research, development, data, and documentation available to the artist community, on-chain. Our intention by dissolving is to leave the framework for community-led efforts that focus on missions instead of the institutionalization of action.\n\n### Why a DAO?\n\n[Nexus\\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LQPNN9zgYc)\n\nLimitations to resources and barriers to education have presented themselves in a number of ways while producing this exhibition. **ghost**DAO serves as a regenerative streamlining of support to accomplish our communities’ goals as our shared needs make themselves known. These key factors, once properly resolved, will no longer stifle the operations of this project:\n\n* Requiring institutional backing or capital to gain access to educational references and resources from academic journals, databases, and other archives\n* Paying for first-hand accounts or sources related to our research; including people or property\n* Investing in new and pre-existing solutions to the problems that arise in the process of the study, as well as those suggested by our data analysis\n* Production and labor costs\n* Mutual aid efforts\n\n### Vodun (Paris)\n\n[crowdfund://0x7213aA1d22A74c03D5fc07871b33E55Db5a7805a?version=podium_1&network=mainnet](crowdfund://0x7213aA1d22A74c03D5fc07871b33E55Db5a7805a?version=podium_1&network=mainnet)\n\nOur roadmap is a mission-based schematic, colloquially known as a *drill*, based on the completion of milestones at which the DAO is triggered to dissolve. The mission for this version of **ghost**DAO is called *Vodun* (Paris).\n\n**1-800-Comfort Calls Installation**\nComfort Calls is the curation of physical platforms for social exchange rooted in self-healing. In incubation pods, participants are invited to initiate 3 activations that encourage them to occupy their mind, time, and space with concepts around collective wellness.\n\n**B.A.B: Interactive Care Plan: Version 2**\nVersion 1 is live right now and we’re already learning what works and what doesn’t. What is the community responding to? Is it really accessible? What can we do to optimize it? % of funds will be allocated to improving the interactive care plan to make a version 2 that will be accessible to multiple languages with an improved design.\n\n**Artificial Intelligence** **Toolkit**\nIn researching ways to create a smart survey, we wanted to employ an analysis method that decreased the amount of subjectivity when looking at participant responses. Therefore we want to develop artificial intelligence tools that can help us achieve a safe, depersonalized method of analysis.\n\n**B.A.B Journal** After we completed our testing and deployment of B.A.B interactive care plan version 2, we will publish / mint a journal of our findings featuring data analyzed using our custom artificial intelligence toolkit.\n\n**Vodun (Paris)**\nThe final mission is to present our concept for black artist reform in a Moorish-inspired diplomatic correspondence to *TBD* Paris based art institutions. The edict will be the sum total of the research, development, and data collected studying the effects of Black Artist Burnout.\n\nOnce funding goals are raised, **ghost**DAO will actively recruit black and indigenous creatives of all types to join our organization.\n\n### UPDATE:\n\nOn April 11, 2022 **ghost**DAO was interviewed by researcher and professor of art history and theory at the National Superior School of Art of Nancy; [Vanina Gere](https://frenchamerican.org/vanina-gere/).

Our intention by dissolving is to leave the framework for community-led efforts that focus on missions instead of the institutionalization of action.\n\n### Why a DAO?\n\n[Nexus\\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LQPNN9zgYc)\n\nLimitations to resources and barriers to education have presented themselves in a number of ways while producing this exhibition. **ghost**DAO serves as a regenerative streamlining of support to accomplish our communities’ goals as our shared needs make themselves known. These key factors, once properly resolved, will no longer stifle the operations of this project:\n\n* Requiring institutional backing or capital to gain access to educational references and resources from academic journals, databases, and other archives\n* Paying for first-hand accounts or sources related to our research; including people or property\n* Investing in new and pre-existing solutions to the problems that arise in the process of the study, as well as those suggested by our data analysis\n* Production and labor costs\n* Mutual aid efforts\n\n### Vodun (Paris)\n\n[crowdfund://0x7213aA1d22A74c03D5fc07871b33E55Db5a7805a?version=podium_1&network=mainnet](crowdfund://0x7213aA1d22A74c03D5fc07871b33E55Db5a7805a?version=podium_1&network=mainnet)\n\nOur roadmap is a mission-based schematic, colloquially known as a *drill*, based on the completion of milestones at which the DAO is triggered to dissolve. The mission for this version of **ghost**DAO is called *Vodun* (Paris).\n\n**1-800-Comfort Calls Installation**\nComfort Calls is the curation of physical platforms for social exchange rooted in self-healing. In incubation pods, participants are invited to initiate 3 activations that encourage them to occupy their mind, time, and space with concepts around collective wellness.\n\n**B.A.B: Interactive Care Plan: Version 2**\nVersion 1 is live right now and we’re already learning what works and what doesn’t. What is the community responding to? Is it really accessible? What can we do to optimize it? % of funds will be allocated to improving the interactive care plan to make a version 2 that will be accessible to multiple languages with an improved design.\n\n**Artificial Intelligence** **Toolkit**\nIn researching ways to create a smart survey, we wanted to employ an analysis method that decreased the amount of subjectivity when looking at participant responses. Therefore we want to develop artificial intelligence tools that can help us achieve a safe, depersonalized method of analysis.\n\n**B.A.B Journal** After we completed our testing and deployment of B.A.B interactive care plan version 2, we will publish / mint a journal of our findings featuring data analyzed using our custom artificial intelligence toolkit.\n\n**Vodun (Paris)**\nThe final mission is to present our concept for black artist reform in a Moorish-inspired diplomatic correspondence to *TBD* Paris based art institutions. The edict will be the sum total of the research, development, and data collected studying the effects of Black Artist Burnout.\n\nOnce funding goals are raised, **ghost**DAO will actively recruit black and indigenous creatives of all types to join our organization.\n\n### UPDATE:\n\nOn April 11, 2022 **ghost**DAO was interviewed by researcher and professor of art history and theory at the National Superior School of Art of Nancy; [Vanina Gere](https://frenchamerican.org/vanina-gere/).

I knew what NFT’s were before we had that conversation but just never paid attention to it. He said : bro this space is perfect for you, don’t ask me why just go on twitter & join any NFT twitter space and you’ll find your journey, I am so excited to see where this story goes from here…\n\nI still remember saying : bro it’s 4 in the morning rn on a Saturday night and you’re telling me to go on twitter space rn and follow some monkey’s??? lol\n\nIn my mind I was like this dude’s lit & out of his right frame of mind. Finishing our sentences he said Teddy trust me, I know you and I am telling you this is a one way ticket to the life you have always dreamed but never lived and opportunities like this are very hard to find. I just laughed at it and I was like I’ll think about it and let you know…\n\nThen after a week I was playing soccer with Shadow in my backyard thinking about what Sam said the other day and tbh I enjoyed hearing him & everything he had to say with enthusiasm over the potential of NFT’s. Btw Sam is a well known artist in the space, and now after spending all this time in this space I get it why he was hyper that day. Anyways, then I went on my twitter and switched my profile form private to public. I joined my first twitter space, It was with @NFTPrince & NFTsquirrels. Both are living legends and I respect them a lot. They shared tons of selfless advice to me on first day without even knowing who I was, what my real name is, or how I looked like. The knowledge was so valuable that basically I’ve never been rugged / scammed in this space till date. \n\nAfter spending some time in different spaces and observing how everything is working in this ecosystem, I focused on the fundamentals, the way people interact and react with certain things, what values they carried, and how do they find their feeling of importance. It was’nt very difficult for me to figure these things out because of my knowledge & experience with Social Media for over 5 years. I grew 36 million+ followers on Instagram via different entertainment pages and a network of over 250 million+ followers via networking in less than 6 months with just 2,000$ to start with from my college dorm.\n\nDuring that time Bored Ape’s were just flying and they still are but the vibes were immaculate last year you can’t deny that. I literally did a PHD on them and I was just astounded by their story but I was able to relate a lot of it to my life, it was so inspiring and fascinating. I was thinking so much about it, that even in my dreams I was seeing NFT’s all around me and my life changed the night of September 30 with that one lucid dream, I decided to do a project to share my story so that others can relate to it and be a part of it. \n\n( Note : This was’nt the main reason for me to do a NFT project. My main goal was and is still the same today that I want to leave this NFT space better than how I found it. )\n\nBack to the story, why Teddy? Well obviously. My friend’s call me Teddy and Teddies have been a part of everyone’s childhood and I believe people will hold on to that tradition forever. They provide us the comfort & companionship, a friend to talk to, and it’s not just kids who benefit from the positive effects of a comforting Teddy squeeze. Teddies are just universal and timeless.\n\nI put all of my traits and character and imagination’s in the art, from my expressions to the way I dress. Some of the assets are added for the aesthetics of the collection. I am not an artist but since I was the character I worked with few freelance artist’s to bring my idea on paper. They asked me for a sketch to give an idea of what I wanted and this is what I sent them lmao 😂😂😂😂😂😂\n\n![ That Yu-Gi-Oh and LV belt part has my heart lmaoooo😭😭😭. Tbh this image is still a lot better than my first one. Btw I am not rich lol, I don't have a AP watch or fancy items.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p7SJwXfpBXm-_G9fiTlu0.jpg?height=1280&width=960)\n\n![This looks decent lol. Lot better than what I came up with.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vxl5Z9dogU0G7wxHt-euI.png?height=1280&width=720)\n\n![That's me on the Left! Dw I am doxed to all our past holder's and lot of people in NFT space know me irl. My identity is just not public in the space atm. I'll reveal it when time is right.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CL1JyGEQS_ynX1v0M1WGn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nBack to the story, so once I got this I reached out to few professional artist’s in my network and I worked with multiple of them to find the perfect Teddy. We wanted to stick with 2D because 3D art is great but the market seemed to be doing well with 2D more than 3D collections. Ofcs art style isn’t the main reason for it but it does play a role. But then I am like let’s take the challenge and create something insane. During the time when I started the project, their were’nt any 3D project’s coming out just yet nor there were any noticeable Teddy Bear collections popping as long as I know. So then we decided to turn this into 3D. During this process one 3D artist reached out to me in my DM’s of one our meme page asking to collab, I am like okay cool lets give it a shot and see what you got. \n\n![This is what he came up with as base model. 💀💀💀](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FcshCcWqBzufElk9puKnW.png?height=772&width=778)\n\nYeah he just lost me on that base model. If ur surprised, I did’nt see this coming either, when I saw it for the first time I was out of words just like you are rn. I seriously had no comments on this image. So yeah I had to say no to that dude and look for another artist. The fact that people fake their LinkedIn and show you proof of work of other artist is just hilarious. So I asked one of my friend on telegram if he knew any artist to connect me and he did. \n\n![Idk tbh, it was just not it.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z3yiJzSTaGmqQdaHZroTJ.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nIt just did’nt feel right going with the full body at this point, gave pfp style a shot and see how it does. Initially the idea was, we will do pfp collection and in a seperate contract and we will give the holders full body version of their Teddy so they have both and can use it the way they like whether to animate or so with the source file…\n\n![I finally said yes to this one and made a deal with the artist and gave her an upfront amount for her time that we both agreed on. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ef-d0SnN5nrZH4EpHIfbn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThe decided to upfront because she told me she had financial instability and urgently need of money for rent and expenses so she would’nt be able to work full time on this project and it would take lot longer to complete the collection than what I was expecting. Plus I genuinely wanted to help her regardless of if she would work for the project or not due to her situation. \n\n![My mind, Her ability.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q7q8YdENYDP5zDlajLh05.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nWe decided to fully render and rigg the collection in the end after all the traits and assets are illustrated and confirmed so that their isn't any confusions and nothing is left out. But unfortunately when she submitted, the quality of collection turned out terrible atleast from my pov. I communicated it with our community and told them that ‘guys we do not have the collection fully rigged and its in between 2D and 3D so we would have to pause the project for now until we find another artist and see how things go from there’. \n\nBut then I was also out of funds because I put everything I had in the project initially. So I communicated this with the community in our discord and 34 people ended up minting 100 regardless of the situation. 10 were minted for team and 1 was minted by me personally to participate in the process just like any other member of community. They knew that mint had zero value and won’t have a secondary market value but yet they still supported. So that moment onwards my belief in the project became even stronger and quitting was never an option no matter what situation I go through. The collection won’t ever be revealed because I don’t believe in trying to sell some bullshit to people just to pocket some eth. In trying to sell NFT’s I am not going to sell my character, tf I look like? ZagaBond? There is a big fat difference between failing and abandoning your project. We don’t give up around here…This project is my dream and it like a child to me. I want to be the best out there in anything I do in life. Whether if it is playing soccer or anything that I hold dear too I give my absolute best to win. When I play soccer I don’t play to just participate I play to make difference, I play to dominate the field. \n\n[https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub](https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub)\n\nSo yeah that was my first failure in NFT space, I learned a lot from that failure. The most important thing was that when starting a business do everything you can to gather great people that have the same drive & BELIEVE IN YOUR VISION as you do. Because in the end all a business is a group of people dedicated to provide service or product to people. Take care of your team like your family & they’ll take care of your business & customers. \n\nThen after I did an outreach again and managed to find a team of 4 professional 3D artist’s. Their past ventures have involved working with brands like Puma, Bangs and Lulu Lemon. Their Identities are anon as they wish to keep it that way but I have confirmed the veracity of their credentials. When I presented this entire idea and vision of the collection to them, after hearing me they instantly said yes and told be that we believe in you and we’re gonna make the best collection of 2022. We started working on it the same day and even with this team, I worked 1 on 1 with the team over screen shares for every single trait’s and asset’s and outcomes are just fantastic. Look It does’nt matter what people think of it but we do believe it is one of the greatest NFT collections that will ever be deployed on Blockchain. We’ve put our blood, sweat and tears in this collection as a team day in and day out. The collection is timeless & it will age well I can make that one promise for sure. \n\n![This collection is dedicated to someone who does'nt need to own it. It's a dream come true. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wKl-h3xgt9G73xjvxW_7_.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThere is no bigger feeling than making your dream come true and the story will never have an end to be honest. I am just the captain of the boat as of now but at some point I want to hand the dream over to the community in a position that even if I am not present the story live forever as long as their is imagination left in this world. \n\nBig hug & Thank you for your time and consideration for reading this. I genuinely appreciate your presence here with all my heart.

The system removes the control banks and institutions have on money, financial products, and financial services.\n\nSome of the key attractions of DeFi for many consumers are:\n\n* It eliminates the fees that banks and other financial companies charge for using their services.\n* You hold your money in a secure digital wallet instead of keeping it in a bank.\n* Anyone with an internet connection can use it without needing approval.\n* You can transfer funds in seconds and minutes.\n\n  ### Decentralized Finance\n\n  Decentralized finance eliminates intermediaries by allowing people, merchants, and businesses to conduct financial transactions through emerging technology. This is accomplished through peer-to-peer financial networks that use security protocols, connectivity, software, and hardware advancements.\n\n  From anywhere you have an internet connection, you can lend, trade, and borrow using software that records and verifies financial actions in distributed financial databases. A distributed database is accessible across various locations; it collects and aggregates data from all users and uses a consensus mechanism to verify it.\n\n  Decentralized finance uses this technology to eliminate centralized finance models by enabling anyone to use financial services anywhere regardless of who or where they are.\n\n  DeFi applications give users more control over their money through personal wallets and trading services that cater to individuals.", "timestamp": 1653245371, "digest": "dMPO6CJ-fZtOv13vssskl_cfPKwGA07KdSgawA8n0VQ", "contributor": "0x2169Ec73eeB5287Ed3180b401B6383BEaf5a2011"}

{"id": "Pqqol7jeEi583r4UcDCDnqAizyby41Nf8hYr7m8rdqw", "title": "In April, the production and sales of automobile enterprises were cut by half, and new energy became popular against the market", "body": "Recently, the passenger Federation released the latest passenger car sales in April. According to the data, in April 2022, the retail sales volume of the domestic narrow passenger car market reached 1043000, with a year-on-year decrease of 35.5% and a month on month decrease of 34.0%. The year-on-year and month on month growth rate of retail in April were at the lowest in the history of that month. From January to April, a total of 5.958 million vehicles were retailed, a year-on-year decrease of 11.9%.\n\nIn this regard, the China Railway Passenger Transport Federation pointed out that due to the impact of the epidemic, there is a shortage of imported parts, domestic parts system suppliers involved in the Yangtze River Delta are unable to supply in time, and some even completely shut down or shut down. In addition, the logistics efficiency is reduced and the transportation time is uncontrollable, resulting in the prominent problem of poor production.\n\nIn addition, in April, the production of five major auto enterprises in Shanghai decreased by 75% month on month compared with March, the production of joint venture major auto enterprises in Changchun decreased by 54%, and the overall decline in other regions was 38%. The national radiation effect of the parts system in Shanghai was prominent. It can be seen that the impact of the epidemic on the automotive industry is still great.\n\nAuto Enterprises: SAIC’s sales are greatly affected\n\nDue to the impact of the epidemic, the sales ranking of automobile enterprises changed greatly in April. The champion of FAW Volkswagen was taken away by BYD, and the sales volume of SAIC (including SAIC Volkswagen, SAIC GM and SAIC GM Wuling) fell collectively. In particular, SAIC GM Wuling has fallen out of the top ten list.\n\nAlthough the sales volume of independent brands is passable, Geely and Chang’an are on the list one after another, but the sales volume data is not good-looking, and great wall motor also ranks outside the top 10; It is noteworthy that the overall performance of the Japanese system is fairly good, with GAC Toyota in the third place and Dongfeng Nissan in the second place.\n\nBYD, which ranked first, had a brilliant sales performance in April, reaching 105000 vehicles. It was also the only auto enterprise with a sales volume of more than 100000 vehicles in April, with a year-on-year increase of 138.4% and a market share of 10%. It has to be said that BYD’s achievements with new energy vehicles are worth learning from many car enterprises. In particular, the model equipped with DM-I super hybrid system launched by BYD is very popular and the product is excellent enough.\n\nThe sales volume of Geely Automobile and Chang’an Automobile, both independent brands, also declined to varying degrees in April. Among them, Geely Automobile sold 54600 vehicles in April, with a year-on-year decrease of 40.4% and a market share of 5.2%, ranking fifth; Chang’an Automobile followed, with a sales volume of 53700, with a market share of 5.2%, ranking sixth.\n\nUnfortunately, Great Wall Motors has been squeezed out of the top ten list in April. According to the official data released by Great Wall Motors, the Haval brand sold 29125 vehicles in April; Euler brand sells 3088 vehicles; Wei brand sells 2293 vehicles; The tank brand sells 6065 vehicles.\n\nAccording to our rough calculation, the sales volume of the passenger car sector of Great Wall Motor in April was only more than 40000, and the data of the passenger Federation was 35600. In this regard, Great Wall attributed the problem to the domestic epidemic, supply chain, logistics and other impacts, but this is also a common problem faced by all auto enterprises. However, the decline of great wall motor is obvious, which shows that great wall motor is still under great pressure.\n\nNext, let’s look at the sales performance of the joint venture brand in April. FAW Volkswagen sold 81000 vehicles in April, down 49.2% year-on-year, losing the championship, which is not a small gap with BYD’s sales of 105000 vehicles; The same brother SAIC Volkswagen was even worse, with sales of only 52000 vehicles, down 52.4% year-on-year, falling to the eighth place, mainly due to the impact of the epidemic and the shortage of parts.\n\nSAIC General Motors of SAIC system sold only 50000 vehicles in April, a year-on-year decline of 57% and a market share of 4.8%, ranking ninth. Similarly, as the main sales source of SAIC Group, SAIC GM has made some miserable achievements. At the same time, SAIC GM Wuling was also squeezed out of the top 10. The impact of the epidemic in Shanghai on SAIC Group is indeed not small.\n\nThe performance of Sino Japanese brands of joint venture car enterprises is fairly reasonable. GAC Toyota ranked third, with sales of 64000 vehicles in April, down 7.3% year-on-year. GAC Toyota is the enterprise with the lowest sales decline among the top ten car enterprises. Compared with Japanese Dongfeng Nissan, Dongfeng Honda and GAC Honda, the decline is not obvious.\n\nDongfeng Nissan ranked fourth, with sales of 58000 vehicles in April, a year-on-year decline of 43.4% and a market share of 5.5%. Dongfeng Nissan’s sales volume is good, or Xuanyi’s car is the biggest credit. If the reason for the decline in sales volume is not only the cause of the epidemic, but also the defect in the product power of xinxinjun, which leads to the obvious decline in sales volume.\n\nAmong the Japanese series, the sales volume of Honda series is average. The sales volume of Dongfeng Honda in April was 52000 vehicles, down 38.4% year-on-year, with a market share of 5%; GAC Honda sold 43000 vehicles, a year-on-year decline of 33.2% and a market share of 4.1%. The year-on-year decline of the two car companies exceeded 30%, and the sales performance was very general.\n\nBecause of the epidemic, many auto enterprises suffered serious losses, especially the shortage of parts led to the shutdown and shutdown of auto enterprises. Although the follow-up factories began to resume production, it was very difficult to catch up in a short time.\n\nSUV: BYD wins Grand Slam\n\nFrom the performance of SUV segment market, the cumulative sales volume in April was 459000, a year-on-year decrease of 38.6% and a month on month decrease of 38.1%; From January to April, the cumulative sales volume was 2.767 million, a year-on-year decrease of 11%.\n\nFrom the ranking of SUV sales in April, the overall characteristics are as follows: the BYD Song family still performed well, won the champion of SUV sales, and the performance of 25105 vehicles far exceeded that of Honda CR-V and Haval H6, which ranked second and third. In addition, BYD’s other SUV models, such as BYD Tang and BYD yuan plus, are all in the top 10 of the list;\n\nHaval H6 still failed to turn over this time, ranking third, suppressed by BYD Song family and Honda CR-V; In the high-end luxury SUV market, Mercedes Benz GLC and BMW X3 have entered the list, and Audi Q5 has disappeared; Because of the impact of the epidemic, Tesla Model y disappeared from the list. Next, we briefly analyze the market performance of each SUV model.\n\nIn the first place is the BYD Song family. The sales volume in April was 25105, with a year-on-year increase of 60.2%.

What contribution has it made to realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation? What valuable historical experience do you have? What should the Communist Youth League do in the new era?  \n\nNi Bangwen, Secretary of the Party committee of the Central Youth League school (China Youth Political College), said: “the important speech of the general secretary is highly political, ideological and strategic. It comprehensively and systematically reviews the history of the Communist Youth League in the past 100 years and points out the direction for the party’s youth work in the new era.”\n\nThe fate of youth has always been closely linked with the times. More than 100 years ago, when the nation was in danger, a group of young people who first awakened held high the banner of Marxism and lit the revolutionary fire in the dark night. In 1921, a group of young people with an average age of 28 established the Communist Party of China. Once the Communist Party of China was born, it paid attention to the youth and placed the hope of revolution on the youth. On May 5, 1922, under the direct care and leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Communist Youth League of China was established. Since then, the Chinese youth movement has opened a new chapter in history.\n\nWhat the party flag refers to is what the regiment flag refers to. From the day of its birth, the Communist Youth League has always been unswervingly following the party. In the course of a hundred years of struggle, the Communist Youth League has united the majority of Chinese youth, listened to the party’s command and fought with the party, and has made positive contributions and played an important role in various historical periods.\n\nOver the past 100 years, generation after generation of League members and young people have advanced one after another for the country and the nation. In the journey of striving for national independence, they rushed to the front and shed their blood; In the vast world of new China, they worked selflessly and worked hard; They are at the forefront of reform, opening up and modernization\n\nDean of the Youth Development Institute of the University of international business and economics Lian Si, an expert member of the national medium and long term youth development plan, said: “If we look at the history of this league, I think it is a song of youth played by the youth love party and the party love youth polyphony. On the one hand, the youth love the party, and the majority of young people sincerely follow the party to build a new China in the decadent world, in which the Communist Youth League has also played the value of the times of organizing and mobilizing young people; on the other hand, the party loves young people, and the party spared no effort to build a stage and create a platform for young people What role can we see the Communist Youth League play? It is an important mission to convey the voice of the party, gather the opinions of young people and ensure the development of young people. “\n\n \n\n  To guide the formulation of the first youth development plan and the first white paper specially issued for youth groups in the history of new China; Put forward a series of new ideas, viewpoints and conclusions around youth work to promote all-round progress and historic achievements in China’s youth development.\n\nLi Di, deputy director of the Youth Rights and interests Department of the Communist Youth League Central Committee, said: “while promoting and leading the party’s youth work, the general secretary also answered a series of major strategic topics such as what kind of youth to cultivate in the new era, how to cultivate youth, what kind of Communist Youth League to build and how to build the Communist Youth League, which provides fundamental guidance and guidance for the work of the Communist Youth League and the party’s youth work.”\n\nWhat are the Chinese youth like in the new era? We can see that during the outbreak raid, nearly half of the medical staff in Wuhan were “post-90s” and “post-00s”. In the major task of tackling key scientific and technological problems, a large number of young scientific and technological talents have played a leading role: the average age of “Shenzhou team” is 33 years old, and the average age of China Tianyan fast R & D team is only 30 years old\n\nAt the 2022 Winter Olympics, Su Yiming and a large number of athletes worked hard to let people see the best appearance of youth.\n\nOn the battlefield of poverty alleviation, in the process of defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and at every critical moment when the motherland and the people need it, the Communist Youth League has united and led the Youth League members to shoulder the heavy burden entrusted by the state and the nation, and demonstrated their determination and responsibility with practical actions.\n\n \n\nThe long march from generation to generation. Realizing the Chinese dream is a historical relay race. At present, the great changes in the world that have not been seen in a century have accelerated the evolution, and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered a critical period. On the new journey, how to better unite, organize and mobilize young people to strive for the realization of the second Centennial goal and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is a major issue that must be answered by China’s youth movement and youth work in the new era.\n\nLian Si said: “in his speech, the general secretary put forward four hopes for the Communist Youth League. Adhering to educating people for the party is the fundamental task of the Communist Youth League’s work. Conscientious responsibility is actually a duty and mission of the Communist Youth League. Caring for the majority of young people is a driving source of the Communist Youth League’s work. Being brave in self revolution is actually a fundamental guarantee for the Communist Youth League’s continuous self iteration and self-development.”\n\n  for instance,", "timestamp": 1653245573, "digest": "uPi7WPgb4IiR__ScPz5ijQNsX2AwbSBnJm0QzU7p8R4", "contributor": "0x0727CBC189380057FEd7E2ECe1d60099dECa589d"}

{"id": "pmlHLQppScxont1uIa8CBC4P1zWTMZguNiuyQUwiVcs", "title": "Why Owning NFTs Will Be The Future of Your Identity ", "body": "By [Zachary Scott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharyscott01/)\n\nIn the wake of what can only be described as a global NFT craze, I find myself wondering what more there is to the future of NFTs other than digital art…\n\n**Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and more specifically their smart contracts may prove to have a much deeper and more transformative impact than most casual observers would expect. There is a day on the horizon where NFTs will form the basis of our identities and reflect the characteristics of our individual personalities.**\n\nLooking beyond “material” possessions (and not material in the sense of tangible items as we all know that by definition NFTs are not quite this) but material in the sense of valuable digital art of which we have seen many amazing [examples](https://foundation.app/). 2021 was the year that NFTs became mainstream, but the more we learn the more we realise there is still a long way to go in the development of this technology with many real-world [use cases](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763) that will impact our everyday life, on the surface and within.\n\n**It's not about what you own but who you can become**\n\n[Alex Danco](https://alexdanco.com/) does a truly fantastic job at describing this in Packy McCormick’s [Not Boring – Tokengated Commerce](https://www.notboring.co/p/tokengated-commerce?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0NjkxMjA4OSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NTMxNTkyODYsIl8iOiJSSnFQaCIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTUwMTYwMywiZXhwIjoxNjUxNTA1MjAzLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMTAwMjUiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.SUd1yV_bVySDF3oItpvsNG0eNLwdiqKdVxeo4ehH_pU&s=r) and I would highly recommend it for anyone wanting to dive a little deeper. Fundamentally, they discuss how crypto has always been about what you can do and NFTs, what you can own, but there is something more at play here and that is who you can become.\n\nOwnership of an NFT has often been associated with identity but this concept has the potential to play a much bigger role in our daily lives than just being a member of the latest cool trend. NFTs [represent](https://www.web3.university/tracks/build-your-first-nft) a new file format, our digital social identities are rapidly growing and for the first time this measure of culture and community can be neatly packaged in a way that can be just as easily interpreted by computers as it can be by people.\n\nWe humans are tribalistic beings, we long for belonging and to be a part of something. As owners of NFTs we will be people with [wallets](https://metamask.io/) and these wallets can be connected to discord channels, dapps and marketplaces as a means of communicating said identity. \"NFTs are a new token of meaning on the internet for 'fit in, and stand out', one of the most important raw ingredients for so many wonderful things in the world - culture, community, commerce\" says Alex who is working on what he refers to as Tokengated Commerce, taking this idea of signifying community membership and applying it to consumer experiences. \n\nIn the form of digital art NFTs are an output of commerce but following this they can evolve to be an input for commerce. Imagine shopping online but when you connect your wallet the retailer’s platform responds in a way that acknowledges you. This recognition has the power to be leveraged in a way that promotes inclusion far beyond any of the loyalty programs we see currently. The ‘gated’ aspect will gamify the experience to an extent as well, making certain products or real life experiences unlockable dependent on your identity, we have seen the beginning of this already with [Coachella](https://nft.coachella.com/bloom) utilising rare flower NFTs for specific area access, redemption mechanisms for products and other rare experiences.  In his [Three Stages of Adoption](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ftx_the-three-stages-of-nft-adoption-a-hypothesis-ugcPost-6925816246831603712-bjsB/?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=android_app), FTX’s Trystan Yver describes how this idea of owning digital items that tie back to real life things in particular is how we will onboard the next wave of adopters. The combination of an increasingly personalised experience and one that plays to scarcity by limiting access and creating a challenge for consumers is one that will have a dramatic impact on everyone in the transition to [web3](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blockchain-coming-together-says-berners-200956278.html).\n\n![Source: 2022 In Bloom FTX NFT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZXGFl5jJLSiPwg9zxyzNC.png?height=632&width=744)\n\n**Identification and Verification**\n\nWhat makes NFTs so special is their ability to act as a digital identifier that can be controlled using the integrated smart contracts. This in particular is a benefit that can offer wide ranging practical use for individuals in every walk of life. Medical records and personal identification documents being the most obvious. Both of which are traditionally difficult to access and even harder to replace. Putting the control back into the hands of the individual as opposed to the large health institutions would increase confidentiality and allow the individual to dictate the specific information shared when seeking treatment without disclosing personal data that they wish to keep private.\n\nAnything that is unique can be represented digitally and secured to an NFT. Although the most common use for these special tokens has been in the mediums of digital rarities like artwork and collectibles, their ability to act as a digital representation for something could be extended to even us humans. \n\nAs adoption increases, we could occupy a world where an individual is issued an NFT birth certificate. Inextricably linked to the individual, this could be the start of establishing a digital record of identification and form the basis for which to link medical records that can be tracked in NFT form. \n\nA similar principle of identification can be applied to products within the manufacturing process. Take car manufacturing for example, by linking each individual part with a non fungible signature, which could be as simple as a QR code, the automotive supply chain would allow the manufacturer to trace the components in a way that in the event of a recall, could save the company billions if dollars each year by reducing the number of vehicles that would need to be recalled. \n\nWarehouse administration is another aspect of the supply chain that has the potential for radical increase in efficiency through the new standards blockchain enables. Inaccurate inventory can be costly for companies and we know all too well the scope for human error in conventional databases. By incorporating a digital identity that can move with the physical item we reduce the inventory related inaccuracies and increase the authenticity of the original, something that is becoming apparent in the luxury goods industry. \n\nLouis Vuitton [announced](https://www.euronews.com/culture/2022/02/19/fashion-and-blockchain-how-louis-vuitton-and-friends-are-digitising-your-threads) plans to use an NFT optimised supply chain to identify their goods and provide increased transparency throughout the products manufacturing process, adding to the uniqueness and quality. In the past five years we have seen a clear shift in sustainably focused firms and transparency has been a big driver in the promotion of this. As the luxury brands pave the way for what is possible, in the future we may see this authenticity flow down to some more accessible daily products such as clothing or coffee, where us consumers feel strongly about transparency in the entire supply chain process.\n\n![Source: Blockchain in Procurement and Supply Chain](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GjcUD4fEjtufdB9Oi6pM4.png?height=415&width=877)\n\nThe above are mere examples of things that can be easily integrated onto the blockchain via digital twins. Taking this concept of ownership verification there are a plethora of assets with historically clunky proof of ownership systems that we can apply this ideology to. Traditionally, conducting high value asset transactions digitally was uncommon. The process of buying a house can be a stressful experience for most lucky enough to experience it. Consisting of a long winded process with multiple parties involved in substantial paperwork facilitating the deed transfer. The smart contracts that underpin NFTs would allow this asset class and many others that have been notoriously illiquid, to be tokenised and traded as easily as you would trade a cryptocurrency. \n\nMarx Rowan, chief executive officer of Apollo Global Management Inc. said in an episode of “[Bloomberg Wealth with David Rubenstein](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/the-blockworks-group_apollo-ceo-500-billion-aum-on-the-potential-ugcPost-6929371971033956352-xkmL?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=android_app).” “Many of the rails or the technology or the platforms or the systems that support what’s happening in NFT are actually the precursor to changes in our financial system and we ignore them at our peril.” \n\nWork In Fintech's very own [Benyamin Ahmed](https://twitter.com/ObiWanBenoni), NFT [millionaire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abPmJwXan9c) at 12 years old and the youngest ever guest [lecturer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHUWaLcLau8) at Oxford University, will be talking more about digital identities and looking at how this generational shift will propel society further into the digital universe at [NFT.NYC](https://www.nft.nyc/). \n\nFollow [Work In Fintech](https://workinfintech.com/) for more information and to stay up to date as this new technology continues to shape our world.\n\n \n  \n ", "timestamp": 1653245732, "digest": "mQi4RkO97g8cqCnVunD_9kcBoskYxAx3ZC8YDS6ag44", "contributor": "0xcb1dad8Eb819F5E4AFD54284050aCE97Ca900464"}

Jesus, Grayson. What strength?” came his sister’s voice through the phone.\n\nGrayson squinted through the dawn sun at the bottle of pills he had grabbed from his bedside table: *Losonil. Memory Loss. For A Sound Mind.* “Extra Strength… 1 year.”\n\n“I knew it! Just like all the other cowards!”\n\n“Sis, please. There’s nothing?”\n\n“Nothing. You left nothing. You told me nothing. There’s no fucking note. The gall. After everything you’ve said.”\n\n“Everything I said?”\n\n“You haven’t even read the news yet haven’t you? Go fuck yourself. No wonder she left you.”\n\nClick.\n\nSilence.\n\nStealing himself from the dizzy desire to expel whatever food he ate last night, Grayson swiped past a year’s worth of missing data on his phone to open the browser. He took a deep breath and opened the headlines.\n\n*Private Message Leak Continues to Wreak Havoc.*\n\n*Who Is The Hacker? Search Continues.*\n\n*Never Reader Groups Protest Face2Face Offices.*\n\n*Calls for Social Debt Jubilee Rises.*\n\n*New York Opens Additional Mental Health Clinics.*\n\n*Layoffs at Face2Face Continue.*\n\n*Bank CEOs Say That Their Money Is Safe.*\n\nAs Grayson scrolled through the news, the pieces fell into place.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a hack of Face2Face was revealed. By breaking the encryption through an unknown method, about a year’s worth of private messages and location data from a billion people were collected by a hacker, and leaked. Almost immediately, as the world verified the truth of it, the fallout began. At a college party in Georgetown the beer pong and loud EDM turned down to hushes. A woman left an apartment in Cape Town with all her belongings in a box, slamming the door in the face of her now ex-boyfriend. A woman in Dubai called her sister in Mumbai to ask if she knew about their father. A Hong Kong man threw xiaolongbao at his friend, asking him why he lied about the money. In Sydney, a friend texted another friend wondering why they were always so afraid to share the truth of how they felt towards each other. In Buenos Aires, a woman cried and kissed a fading picture of her husband after learning the truth about his death. A father in Reykjavik cried over hearing his daughter’s last, joyful voice notes sent to her friends before the accident.\n\nAt first, it was all individual stories of pain, guilt, and frustration, but also of joy, release, and closure. New connections and disconnections. But, then, the fallout snowballed into groups: Never Readers, Forgivers, and Transparenters to name a few. Never Readers resisted the temptation and vowed to stay with the true intent. They wished to not violate the consent of those who discussed things in private. The Never Readers had its own sub-groups, with one side going with the flow (the Flow Nevers). Their belief was: it happened, it doesn’t need to be read, and that’s okay. The other (the Never Evers), vowed to destroy the dataset through any means possible. It was an abomination and a temptation that had to be forever erased.\n\nThe Forgivers read the dataset, but vowed to accept the true nature of humanity. None of us were perfect after all: we bad mouth others, cheat, and lie. Now that the truth was out: we forgive and move on. However, the Transparenters were a bit more radical: believing that this represented a new reality and evolution for society. We should all be transparent with all our thoughts with everyone around us. It was telepathy, a way to grow collectively, and to erase the harm of the ego.\n\nThe world economy also fell off a cliff. Not only did most people stop using social media, but it was uncertain whether any technology was reliably encrypted: the entire bedrock of the world economy. It faltered, with group CEOs of the Fortune 500 coming together to issue a statement saying that while investigations continue, they believe it was only an issue at Face2Face. The hacker was also still on the loose, having managed to hide their tracks. It was then that Grayson checked his phone again. He couldn’t log into his Face2Face work email. Smearing his hands through his face as if it would somehow paint back a year’s worth of memories, he ghosted towards the kitchen and rang his colleague. Inside the fridge was a sandwich with a note to himself: “This is the only thing you get. Sorry. - Grayson”.\n\nAs he inspected it, his colleague answered. “Grayson? Yo. What’s up?”\n\nBiting off a mouthful of egg and bacon, and briefly pausing with it in his mouth, Grayson responded. “Rick…”\n\n“Grayson?”\n\n“Rick…”\n\n“Oh shit. Fuck. G. You didn’t? You promised!”\n\nSwallowing more of the sandwich, Grayson replied with a clearer voice. “I did. Rick. Holy shit. Please tell me I told you something?”\n\n“Well, fuck. This is not good-”\n\n“Why did I take it? Wait, why?”\n\n“Shit, this is not good. Shit. Shit. Okay-”\n\n“Rick, what’s going on?”\n\n“Where are you? At your apartment?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“They are coming today. Meet me at Dawns in thirty. We can’t talk about this over the phone.”\n\nGrayson pulled back his phone to check the day of the week. It was Monday. “I don’t have a job anymore, do I?”\n\n“Right on, dickhead. I don’t either. See you soon. I’ll explain.”\n\nClick.\n\nSilence.\n\nGrayson wolfed down the rest of his breakfast sandwich and jumped into the shower. When the condensation evaporated he saw a self he did not remember: neat haircut, chiseled abs, and a smooth face. After a short walk, he arrived at Dawns to the smell of coffee, breakfast, and a hint of newly cleaned floors. Scanning the room, a wave from a table in the corner greeted him and he hesitantly walked over amidst a TV blaring the news.\n\n“Yeah, I’ve let go a bit from when you last would remember me. It’s been tough on everyone,” Rick said as Grayson sat down.\n\n“What’s going on?”\n\n“We were all fired. Most of Face2Face got fired. But, since then, our team has been placed under investigation and-”\n\n“They think we did it?” Grayson asked as the waitress arrived.\n\n“We’ll just have some coffee. Thank you,” Rick replied before turning back to Grayson.\n\n“Actually, hang on,” Grayson said, turning towards the waitress before she left. “Can you turn down the TV? It’s a bit much.” She frowned a bit and then nodded affirmatively before heading to the kitchen. “Continue”, he said to Rick.\n\n“Yes, so, yeah. They think we did it. And our lawyers were coming today to take statements to bolster our case. Taking Losonil *the* day before, do you know what that looks like?”\n\n“Yes, I’m not stupid.”\n\n“Then why Grayson?! Are you sure you left no note?”\n\n“Nothing besides my other self leaving me a sandwich, nope. And if there’s one thing I know about myself. I won’t leave myself a fucking treasure hunt.”\n\nRick sighed after a sip of coffee. “Dude. Okay. Well. The lawyers are still coming today… Just tell them the truth, please. And when you can, please check the leaked database. Anything will help our case, even if you took Losonil. Have you looked at the dataset at all?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“About two months in, we switched all our internal comms to exclusively use Face2Face internally. It’s all there. Maybe there’s something in there that will help us.” Grayson was silent as he sipped his coffee. “You’re not going to reply to that? After all we’ve been through?”\n\n“Rick. Relax. I just lost a year of my life. I don’t have a job anymore. The world is in chaos. We’re apparently under investigation? It’s not even obvious that combing through this dataset will actually help us. I also apparently had a girlfriend that left me? None of this makes sense at all. Rick-”\n\n“I know, I know,” Rick replied, catching his breath. “Just. Anything will help at this point.”\n\n“You think someone on our team did it?”\n\n“I didn’t think so, but with more of the team taking Losonil…”\n\n“Who else did?”\n\n“Li did. Aphiwe did… Your ex also. Allison.”\n\n“Is… is that why we broke up? When did she join the team? Do you have a picture of us?”\n\nRick pulled out of his phone, opened his photos and started scrolling through it. Grayson put down his coffee and leaned across the table. Before Rick could get to a photo he suddenly closed his phone.\n\n“You know what. No,” Rick suddenly responded. “Stop changing the subject.” Grayson pulled back in his seat frowning at his friend. “You broke your promise. How can I actually trust you after this?”\n\n“Who is she, Rick?! What did she do to me?!” Grayson shouted at his old friend, yanking the phone from his hand.\n\nRick stole his phone back and stood up. “So close Grayson. So close. You actually were so close to changing for the better.” Rick left towards the door.\n\n“I’m just looking for answers!”\n\n“Everyone is, asshole. Can’t even say sorry. Maybe stop looking elsewhere for your answers,” Rick shouted into Dawns before exiting into the morning outside.\n\nThe waitress returned and asked if he was sure he didn’t want some food. He nodded no, downed the coffee, dropped some dollars on the table and left. Outside, he lit a cigarette as a faceless crowd with placards mobbed towards the local park. The only part of their chant he could hear was “Face 2 Face”. Staring into the road as if it hid the answers from him, he took a deep draw of the cigarette and turned the other way back towards his apartment.\n\nWhen he arrived, two men in suits and briefcases were waiting for him next to a statue of a bird he did not recall buying. Grayson straightened himself and walked towards them.\n\n“Mr. Cave. It’s me, Austin, and this is my colleague, whom you’ve also met, Gerard. How are you?”\n\n“Good, and you can call me Grayson,” as he shook their hands and led them inside. As they opened up their tablets on the kitchen table, Grayson interrupted. “Listen. I’m going to make this easy on you. I took Losonil last night. A year’s worth.”\n\nThey kept typing, and then suddenly stopped. “Wait. Can you repeat that?”\n\n“Gerard, right?” Grayson asked as he pointed at the one with the balding head. “I don’t remember you. I took Losonil. Should I say it again?”\n\n“You took Losonil right before we could help you? Why?”\n\n“If I knew why, it wouldn’t be a memory loss pill, now would it?”\n\n“Are you insane?!”\n\nAustin, the one with the big glasses, shifted in his seat, “...okay, guys. Relax.”\n\n“He took Losonil. The day before taking statements. What are we doing here?”\n\nGrayson offered a solution. “Look, if you can figure out why, then we both win, no?”\n\nClosing his tablet, Gerard stood up and started searching through the apartment.\n\n“You could’ve just asked,” Grayson responded to the lawyer going through his stuff.\n\n“Sorry about that,” Austin chimed in.\n\n“It’s fine. There’s no treasure hunt here. I would’ve made it more obvious.”\n\n“Do you mind if we go through your apartment? We’re here to help.”\n\nGrayson looked at Gerard scanning in between stacked books. “Your partner is already doing so. Go ahead.” As much as he hoped that they might find something, he let out a sigh of relief when they finally left with nothing in hand.\n\nAs soon as the door closed behind them, Grayson downloaded the leaked dataset. Amidst the general chatter of tasks and project management comms from his old team, he found her full name: *Allison Bleicher*. He copy-pasted it into the dataset’s search bar and for a moment hesitated before he hit search. A warmth rose up in him and he went to the kitchen to pour a glass of water first. He took a deep breath and hit enter.\n\nThere she was. A beautiful dark-haired woman with blue eyes and a button nose. She was into birds, running, cryptography, and old French films. His hands started shaking as he entered both their names into the search bar. *Allison Bleicher. Grayson Cave.*\n\nHe lurched at the life he won’t ever get back again. They were in love. He effortlessly said all the right things. They were very much in love. He kept scrolling through the early days of their relationship until he halted at a picture of her in lacey lingerie. He moved his chair back, and then suddenly closed his computer. After pacing around in his apartment, he opened the dataset again and entered his own name.\n\nThe past 365 days actually went well. Even went to the gym more often. He pulled up his shirt and felt his abs again. He tapped his nails on his laptop, shook his head, and typed in their names again. The lacey lingerie photo appeared again. With a deep breath he kept scrolling until the photos shared between them undressed themselves to her naked body. The cursor inched closer and hovered over her hips and her breasts. He had responded with his own warm, sunset nude.\n\n*>>* I’m the luckiest man in the world. :heart-eyes-emoji:. You have a body that belongs in a gallery for all the world to see.\n\n<< :winky-face-emoji: We’ll both be on those pedestals one day. For now though. You know where to find me…\n\nThe next message was 16 minutes later.\n\n*>>* I’m outside.\n\nThe next message was a few hours later.\n\n<< Thanks for last night. You’re welcome to apply for a membership pass to this gallery. :winky-face-emoji:\n\nAs he continued scrolling through their relationship, it was all positive messages of affirmation and love. Despite seeing the body of a woman he once shared, what made him choke up the most was hearing her voice: a kind, happy, and gentle voice. One such voice note, left during a humid summer’s day on her way to the grocery store, left her slightly out of breath after listing the ingredients for their dinner. The cicadas sang in the background. As it got closer to the date of the leak, Grayson’s heart kept beating faster. And then, all of a sudden, it ended.\n\n*>>* You are so obsessed with your work. You changed. I can’t anymore. We have to talk.\n\nA week later, the leak was revealed. He logged onto Face2Face to find his account still active, living in a ghost town. All other social media too. In the wake of the hack, 80% of users deleted their accounts. The Allison Bleicher of today was nowhere to be seen. Her number was still in the database, however. He called it.\n\nA dead tone.\n\nHe sighed and called Rick.\n\nIt rang.\n\nIt rang.\n\nIt went to voicemail.\n\n“Hey. Rick. Sorry about this morning. Can we talk? The lawyers were here. I let them look through my apartment. They found nothing. I still know nothing. I’ve looked at the database, but it would really help if I could ask you some questions. Call me.”\n\nClick.\n\nSilence.\n\nHe sighed, ordered some Chinese takeaway, and searched online for any news about leases. It confirmed what he wanted to know: many people had moved after the dataset leaked. There were fresh calls from congress to consider a lease jubilee, allowing anyone to exit without penalties. He started typing in Allison’s name in the search bar alongside the request to display all associated locations. His hand hovered over the “Enter” button, but he pulled back, and slammed his fist into the table to noodles and chopsticks flinging out from his takeaway.\n\nHe recalled his conversations today. His sister shouting at him: “*Who do you think you are?!*” Rick telling him to: “*...maybe stop looking elsewhere for your answers*”, and Allison’s last message to him: “*...you’ve changed*”. In his notepad, he scribbled: *Who am I?*\n\nIn the dataset, he searched for all mentions of himself. Rumours, whispers, and messages from people orbiting his life. Unlike some people who discovered newfound loneliness after discovering that no one ever talked about them, Grayson found plenty of chatter. It crossed the scope of the human condition.\n\nFrom the good:\n\n“Grayson is a great candidate! Definitely send the offer letter.”\n\n“Yeah, Grayson is also coming. He usually makes this kickass cocktail. Also, knows a shit-ton about obscure poetry. You’ll love him.”\n\n“I miss Grayson, man. Wish he didn’t move.”\n\nTo sexual, “Did you see Grayson’s abs lately? The thirst traps on Face2Face. Um. Yum.”\n\nBut, most of it was negative.\n\n“Why are you still dating him? Does he even listen?”\n\n“Can’t we do something? He literally hogs all the meetings?”\n\n“Can’t you call him? Please, he’s just gonna gaslight me again.”\n\n“Is Grayson coming? He sometimes gets just so abrasive when he’s had a few drinks.”\n\nHe searched for any open source tools that would allow him to get a bigger picture. Not a lot existed, but there were open source libraries for people who wanted to run sentiment analysis on people: insert your name and you would get a word cloud of positive and negative associations. Another interesting one: the serendipity maximizer. It went through the dataset and determined the person in the dataset that would be the most unlikely person that you should’ve met in your life. All those strange coincidences that should’ve happened, but never did. It reminded him of a conversation with Allison that he read a few hours earlier.\n\n<< G. Isn’t it weird that through all of time and space, we managed to meet?\n\n*>>* Life is weird, yeah. A wonderful coincidence. Serendipity at its finest.\n\n<< No, but like specifically. What are the actual odds? If I didn’t meet Skye at that party, so many things would’ve been different. We would never have been put in touch. I wish I knew.\n\n*>>* We would’ve met. I’m sure of it.\n\nWhen he entered his name into the serendipity maximizer, it popped up a name that, as expected, he had never heard of: *Hel Witte*. Grayson frowned as he browsed through what was available of Hel’s life. Seemingly quite active, socially, but only a few photos of others in his life. Although they were supposed to have met, with their apparent coincidental proximity, they haven’t. He scribbled in his notebook: *“Come back to Hel Witte…”*\n\nGrayson kept searching for more open source libraries, but didn’t find any of use. There was one thing he was now after and it was in the notebook, encircled with more thoughts.\n\n*“Who am I? -> I am not myself. I’m the stories in everyone else’s heads. I’m not one person. I’m a composite self. I am many.”*\n\nSo, after hours of work, the sun already having set, he combined the serendipity maximizer and the sentiment analytical tool to create a new tool: one that would create a composite self. It was the combination of what everyone said, influenced and embedded into the social graph of his life. Those closest to him had the highest impacts and weak connections elsewhere had less. When combined, would see his full and real self. After the data crunched, the bright screen in the dark night illuminated the question Grayson was after. There he was, the real complex, messy Grayson. It was an indescribable mirror that suddenly forced tears into his eyes. It was his younger self that felt the joy, the one that was always bullied for misunderstanding. It was his younger self that didn’t have the luxury to know what needed to be done before he was punished for being clueless. All those selves pushed tears into his face, blurring the composite self on the screen into what he always wanted to see. He understood himself. Despite this joy, there was a part of himself that glowed dark: his utter selfishness. It wasn’t long before that consumed him again.\n\nHis notebook had collected a new scribble: *“If you could know your composite self and see everything that influenced it, could you manipulate it?”*\n\nBased on his model of the composite self, he determined possible ways that one could manipulate it. Some actions were more powerful. For example, initial impressions and first mentions had a strong halo effect: it lasted very long. Additionally, it seemed that manipulating the social graph itself would also alter his composite self. New people that entered a social circle would drastically alter the composite selves of everyone they directly touched, even to second and third degrees of separation. After he ranked the actions to their strengths, he polled through the dataset to see if there were any instances where these strong manipulative actions clustered unexpectedly. Somewhere in the early morning, energy drink in hand and new stubble on his face, his stomach lurched again - and it wasn’t from missing dinner.\n\nSomeone had indeed been using these strong manipulative methods to alter their composite selves, and it was a name he’d seen before: *Hel Witte*. A man he had never known that was his highest serendipity match: someone who he should’ve met in his life, but never did. With what space was left in his notebook, he wrote in bold: *“COULD THIS BE THE HACKER? WHO IS HEL WITTE?!”*\n\nGrayson put Hel Witte’s name into Face2Face, and there he was, not deleted. An anomaly.\n\nOpening up the messenger, Grayson shakingly typed: “Hey?”\n\nHis heart pounded as the person on the other end was typing …\n\n<< Hey Grayson. I knew this might happen.\n\n*>>* What? I don’t understand?\n\n<< Do you want to know who I am?\n\n*>>* Yes.\n\n<< Then this was the only way. Trust me. Come find me here.\n\n<Location Pin Shared\\*>\\*\n\n*>>* Who are you?\n\nThere was no further reply. Entering the pin on Face2Face Maps revealed a location a short drive away in an old warehouse. His eyes darted around, uncertain if this was a memory he was supposed to remember. He entered this location, and Hel Witte into the dataset. Nothing for the latter, but the location popped up occasionally, precisely for what it seemed to be: a seemingly empty warehouse. Squinting at the screen, hoping that it would reveal who Hel Witte was, Grayson called Rick again.\n\nIt rang.\n\nIt rang.\n\nIt rang. Click. Silence. No voicemail.\n\nHe took a deep breath and searched for his name alongside his sister. There, in a message to a co-worker, was the Grayson that his sister rejected.\n\n<< This firewall bug feels like my ex, lol. Seemingly impenetrable, but if you push the right button, it all falls down.\n\n*>>* I know the feeling. Sounds like my sister, tbh. So scared of life that she feels compelled to lash out at everything with even the slightest breeze against her. Makes her a bit of a bitch.\n\nHe called her.\n\nIt rang.\n\nIt rang.\n\nIt rang. It went to voicemail.\n\n“Hey, this is Steph. I’m not at the phone right now. Please leave a message if you are the kind of person who likes to leave a message. Voice notes are also fine. Okay, bye.”\n\n“Hey, sis. I’m sorry about what I said. I truly am. I found the messages I wrote. Can I make it up to you? I’ll bring you some key lime pie? Listen. I need to know something. Do you know a Hel Witte? The dataset says you do? Call me back when you can, please.”\n\nWhen Grayson put the phone down, he realised partly why no one was answering. It was 5:12 AM. He looked towards his bed and towards his apartment door. After a deep breath, he threw on some warmer clothes, picked up his keys, and jumped into his car to the radio blaring an early morning talk show on the hack. He turned it off and drove towards the warehouse.\n\nOn the highway, the first signs of the dawn gradient painted itself on the horizon. It was cold and fresh as the Sisyphean sun swept the night away. Alongside ads for injury lawyers, a billboard stood out: “God always knew everything. Repent, forgive, and trust Him.”\n\nWhen Grayson arrived at the warehouse and turned off the rumbling engine, the silence rang in his ears. The only noise was the distant highway and early planes jetting consultants off to cities elsewhere.\n\nA door into the warehouse was ajar with a light clawing into the yard. He edged closer as the crunchy cold dust pierced underneath his boots through the morning silence. Peering around the door’s frame, he suddenly winced back when he saw about ten silhouettes inside. He tried to slow down his breath, but his heart felt like a kick drum, booming away.\n\nNothing. He heard nothing. Peering back around the frame, holding his gaze, he saw that the silhouettes weren’t moving. He inched in and his eyes acclimated to the static crowd in front of him. It was cardboard cutouts with question marks on them. Frowning, he moved through the crowd to a tiny table at the back of the warehouse. On it, was a phone plugged into a power outlet. He picked it up and it instantly recognized his face, unlocking it.\n\nShaking and dizzy, he picked up the phone to see that there was one text file on it that simply said: README. He tapped on it, and it prompted for a password. He tried some of his own passwords, but none worked. Looking around, he found nothing that could indicate that there was a password nearby. Grayson tried recalling parts of what he had read about Hel Witte. He tried a bunch of long shots, to no avail. His stomach churned after not having had dinner, taking him back to the sandwich he left himself the day before. Frowning, Grayson typed: “This is the only thing you get. Sorry. - Grayson.”\n\nIt opened and the first sentence took his breath away.\n\n“Hey Grayson. I knew this might happen. Hel Witte isn’t real. I created him. Or, *we*, created him. I am your other self. I left this letter to you. You hacked Face2Face and you leaked the dataset. I’ll tell you why, and I’ll tell you why I took Losonil.”\n\nGrayson fell to his knees as he rested his back against the table legs before continuing to read the letter he wrote to himself.\n\n“By the fact that you found this letter, it tells me that what I might tell you, won’t be new. It all started a month into your memory loss. By accident you discovered a serious vulnerability in the key generation of Face2Face’s encryption. This also affected end-to-end encryption. The possibilities were intoxicating. For so many years, you’ve felt misunderstood, and this meant that maybe, finally, you could get out of your rut and understand so many more things: yourself, the world, and others. You didn’t hesitate.\n\n“During this initial data gathering phase, Allison joined the team. At first, there was light playful attention between you and her, but when it didn’t go further, you saw it as the perfect time to finally use the power you had at your fingertips. Slowly, but surely, learning who she was, you changed yourself and said exactly the right things. It worked, and you grew closer. Once the relationship worked, the desire did not go away. It burned in you, to know more. Delusions of grandeur spiraled and you knew that the most important project you could do, was to perfect the use of this dataset to your benefit. You always wanted to know yourself, and now you could. You saw, in real-time, how the dataset moved and morphed: words, messages, and actions spiraling into new connections and disconnections. In order to gain power over this beast, you had to know yourself. So, you built the composite self: a combined person of all the people you are to others.\n\n“Many variables were involved, including yourself, where others were in the social graph, what they said about you, and where they were. That moment you first saw your full self, you were in ecstasy. And then, you became all powerful. You could see how any and all actions in your circle affected you. And so, with your composite self, you started crafting the version you wanted to be. By saying the right things at the right time, and introducing the right people to each other, you saw in real time how your composite self improved. But, your hubris got the best of you. All of this manipulation started seeping into the people around you. Allison left you because you became consumed by altering your composite self. At first, with her leaving, it even improved your composite self because she blocked you. Slowly, but surely, the feedback loop went into the wrong direction. You increasingly manipulated yourself, even to the point of personal abuse.\n\n“When the composite self didn’t change the way you wanted it to, you even punished yourself. In your wake was not just a self destroyed, but also the wreckage of many broken relationships. It all came to a head when the woman who was there for you, for all your life, was ostracized to improve your self image. After you sent that message to your sister, the cracks of the composite self appeared and you came face to face with yourself.\n\n“Staring ever deeper into this abyss, drunk on creating a new you, you saw the real Grayson that was led to this point: a Grayson that just needed self-love. You didn’t need to manipulate yourself into a perfect you, you just had to accept what you’ve done and who you’ve become. You are just human, Grayson. Flawed, like everyone else. Just a human that tries to do good with the world that forced them into the spaces and times they weren’t ready for. From the brink, however, you could see the void that awaited others and humanity if this power was left unchecked: an undetectable human with vast manipulative power. If they didn’t have a filter, the world would never be the same.\n\n“The entire system had to be nuked. By leaking the dataset, trust in private communications on social media would evaporate. It would be costly for society, but worth it. You, however, would still be a broken God. While you would save humanity from a potential disaster, you achieved an epiphany at the cost of the lives of others. You manipulated the people around you to arrive at this point. You had to atone to truly deserve this epiphany. You could’ve asked for forgiveness, but it would be meaningless without the entire truth that you were the hacker. That wasn’t a cost you would then consider to bear. And so, the most meaningful atonement would be merely to forget the epiphany. You would take Losonil and delete as much of this past year from your life as you can.\n\n“However, I knew that there was a possibility that having forgotten this entire year, I would follow the same path without the lesson I had learned. Even though the dataset wouldn’t be real time anymore and people would stop using private social media, I was afraid you would somehow continue down a dark path and cause more destruction again in your wake. I still had a duty to stop that from happening, and so instead of just leaving a note on your bedside table, I would only intervene if you arrived at the same conclusion: that a dataset like this would be used to manipulate others. I moved many of the manipulations I did in the past year and split it into a fake person: *Hel Witte*. By baiting your curiosity, I knew if you arrived at Hel Witte, I’d be able to get you out here and share the truth with you. You know yourself, but not nearly as well as you think you do. The faceless crowd in this room is there to help you answer the question that’s been plaguing you, your entire life.\n\n*Who am I?*\n\nRather, the question should be. *Who are we not?*\n\nWhile you now know the full truth again, you’re back where you started. You’ve failed. It’s time to truly atone.\n\nI love you, asshole.”\n\nThe screen turned black and he saw himself briefly in the reflection before a choice appeared.\n\n“In five minutes, the phone will notify the press of your hack, the way it happened, and why you did it. *Or*, you can cancel this countdown and erase the phone. I know what I would do, do you?”", "timestamp": 1653245793, "digest": "g6Ugf8LFFYLmjei4otUckKjvfPRNiIkqeVyvtmjPlCQ", "contributor": "0x4086583a20335BA5a333547b6D5327aD6e002261"}

The total amount of refunded compensation was nearly 80million yuan, and the Simba Kwai account number was permanently closed.\n\nOn May 11, the relevant person in charge of Henan Consumer Association declined the interview with e-Law of Finance and economics. The relevant person in charge of Simba team introduced the main dispute focus in the trial.\n\nSpecifically include: whether Henan consumer association can put forward the lawsuit claim of “refund one compensation three”; Whether the company involved should jointly bear the responsibility of “one refund and three compensation”, and if necessary, how to calculate the amount of refund and compensation that should be borne by all parties; Whether there is a legal basis for permanently shutting down Simba and its companies’ live studio accounts; Whether Henan Consumer Association has performed its public welfare duties before litigation.\n\nAs a new form of e-commerce rising in recent years, the introduction, display and publicity of products brought by live broadcasting have broken through the regulatory scope of laws and regulations such as advertising law. At present, a series of laws and regulations have been issued, including the code of conduct for webcast marketing, the measures for the supervision and administration of online transactions and the measures for the administration of webcast marketing (for Trial Implementation). The regulatory authorities have also launched special rectification actions to make it clear that “the problem of illegal and illegal profits shall be strictly dealt with”, including the false publicity of marketing goods.\n\nIn the view of Ma Xiangxiang, partner of Beijing Anjie law firm, “there is a complete and mature rule system for live broadcasting with goods. However, in specific practice, relevant subjects need to comply with the requirements of laws and regulations”. She pointed out that a remarkable feature of digital economic governance is multiple collaborative governance. Therefore, consumer organizations, industry associations and other institutions should play an important role in the supervision and governance of live broadcasting and goods.\n\nTherefore, the lawsuit initiated by Henan Consumer Association is known as the first public interest litigation case of live delivery of goods. All parties believe that this case is of great significance to the normative development of this emerging industry.\n\n01\n\nThe whole story of “false bird’s nest incident”\n\nAt the end of October 2020, consumers pointed out that the bird’s nest sold by Simba’s anchor “Shida Meili” in the live studio was actually sugar water. On November 27 of the same year, Simba issued a letter of apology, saying that when the involved “Mingzhi” bird’s nest products were promoted and sold in the live broadcasting room, “there was indeed exaggerated publicity, and the ingredient of bird’s nest was less than 2G per bowl”. Simba put forward the “first compensation scheme”, recalled all the “Mingzhi” brand bird’s nest products sold in Xinxuan live studio, and promised to refund one for three.\n\nOn December 23 of the same year, the Guangzhou municipal market supervision bureau reported the investigation and handling situation and planned to impose an administrative penalty of ordering Guangzhou Heyi e-commerce Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Guangzhou Heyi”), the founder of the live broadcasting room involved, to stop the illegal act and impose a fine of 900000 yuan. Guangzhou Rongyu Trading Co., Ltd., the main seller of goods involved in the case, was ordered to stop the illegal act and fined 2 million yuan.\n\nOn the same day, the official microblog of Kwai e-commerce also announced that after the incident, the brand’s bird’s nest products were taken off the shelves of Kwai e-commerce in the whole station, and the e-commerce function of “Shida Meili” account was banned for 14 days; Xin Youzhi (Simba), the person in charge of Heyi in Guangzhou to which the anchor belongs, was required to properly deal with the after-sales problems and cooperate with the investigation of relevant departments. The live broadcast of Xin Youzhi’s personal account was suspended from November 17.\n\nThe announcement also said that according to the investigation and handling by the Guangzhou municipal market supervision bureau, Kwai e-commerce decided to take further measures: from now on, the account of “Shida Meili” will be closed for 60 days; Close Xin Youzhi’s personal account for 60 days. In addition, the accounts of 27 e-commerce anchors of Guangzhou Heyi and its affiliated companies were closed for 15 days, and the company was required to organize their e-commerce anchors for relevant training and learning.\n\nHowever, the incident did not end here. In August, 2021, Henan consumers’ Association filed a civil public interest lawsuit against Kwai company, Simba and related companies, requiring them to jointly bear the liability of “one refund and three compensation” and joint and several liability, with a total amount of 79.714156 million yuan.\n\nIn January 2022, after the lawsuit was disclosed, Xinxuan group announced that after the “bird’s nest incident”, it had put forward an advance compensation scheme on November 27, 2020, that is, recalling the products of the live broadcasting room and promising to refund one for three. As of January 14, 2022, the company has paid a total of 41.439 million yuan to consumers, and the compensation scheme is still valid.\n\n02\n\nDoes the consumer association have the right to file public interest litigation?\n\nHenan Consumer Association said in the indictment that at the end of December 2020, Henan Consumer Association successively received consumer complaints and complaints. The bird’s nest purchased in Simba live studio had problems and was suspected of cheating consumers. After investigation and verification, it is determined that it infringes on many unspecified consumers (including 2124 transaction notes in Henan Province, with a total transaction amount of 601000 yuan). Henan Consumer Association believes that this incident infringed on the legitimate rights and interests of many unspecified consumers, caused serious damage to social and public interests, and met the legal conditions for filing consumer civil public interest litigation.\n\nAccording to the interpretation of the Supreme People’s Court on Several Issues concerning the application of law in the trial of consumer civil public interest litigation cases (revised in 2020) (hereinafter referred to as the interpretation of consumer civil public interest litigation), which came into force on January 1, 2021, the conduct of the defendant in filing consumer civil public interest litigation infringes the legitimate rights and interests of many unspecified consumers, or has the potential to endanger the personal Proof materials of preliminary evidence of damage to social and public interests such as property safety risk. For the trial of such cases, the court needs to first review the relevant supporting materials submitted by the local consumer association.\n\nAccording to the previous public information, Simba took the initiative to announce the first Refund Scheme of “one refund and three compensation” on November 27, 2020. Simba said that as of the date of the trial, all consumers who can be contacted by Guangzhou Heyi and meet the refund conditions have been compensated.\n\nThen, the Henan Consumer Association submitted a civil complaint to the Henan intermediate people’s court in August 2021.

{"id": "vwTap7ybXRHxRH32kDGCHSh23i_2zyPWD7p6JOVKdGQ", "title": "Is NFT a big change or real hype?", "body": "The number of words in this article: 3368, about 6 minutes when reading\n\nA mosaic painting sold for 450 million yuan, an ape head for 100 million yuan, and a twitter with five English words for 20 million yuan. The seemingly unimaginable cases are not only people’s expectation of the meta universe, but also the result of the “foam” of the prevalence of market speculation and arbitrage. The risk of scalding should be prevented. The yuan universe in full swing urgently needs to put out the virtual fire and eliminate the turnips.\n\n(Chen Qianling, special commentator of Finance and economics e-Law)\n\nThe meta universe of virtual and real fusion has not yet taken shape, but various magical scenes have occurred frequently in reality.\n\nAt Christie’s auction house, the NFT painting “every day: the first five thousand days” by artist beeple was auctioned, and finally dropped the hammer at a sky high price of US $69.346 million (about 450 million yuan). The work is a digital image composed of 5000 works. In contrast, in the same month, Sotheby’s auction house held the auction of Van Gogh’s masterpiece “Montmartre Street View”, which was sold at a price of 13.091 million euros (about 100 million yuan).\n\nIt sounds puzzling that a pure digital painting is much more expensive than the original work of famous artists.\n\nHowever, it has been proved that beeple’s sky high auction is not an example. In the past two years, the “meta universe works” relying on NFT technology have frequently sold surprisingly high prices——\n\nNBA star curry spent $180000 to buy the “boring monkey” NFT avatar; Sun Yuchen, founder of wave field Tron, took a picture of an ape NFT head for $15 million (about 100 million yuan).\n\nJack Dorsey, the co-founder of twitter, put his first tweet sent out in 2006 on the auction website with only one sentence “just setting up my twttr” and clinched a deal with us $2.9 million (about RMB 18.88 million).\n\nAfter a whole day of fierce competition, the price of the moving picture of “rainbow cat” was finally set at 300 ether coins, which was worth about $560000 at that time.\n\nAll kinds of incredible cases can’t help but make us wonder - why can the works of metauniverse sell at such a high price?\n\n01\n\nWhy are NFT works worth so much money?\n\nFrom the bottom logic, it is people’s optimism and expectation for the complete transformation of the meta universe and the current art market.\n\nWe know that the “value” of works of art lies in its scarcity, emphasizing the exclusivity of the owner in their possession, use, income and disposal. However, in the digital art market, you can easily use and disseminate the works created by the originator in a time-consuming and labor-consuming way by simply “copying” and “pasting”. There are various means of plagiarism, and the problem of authenticity of works is difficult to solve Therefore, the digital art market has failed to open space.\n\nThe “meta universe works” relying on NFT and blockchain technology can solve the key pain points of the traditional digital art market and is expected to burst into vitality no less than that of the traditional art market.\n\nFirst, “protect genuine products”.\n\nThe full English name of NFT is non fungible token, which translates into Chinese: non homogenous token, which is indivisible, irreplaceable and unique. The so-called homogenized token, namely ft (fungible token), can replace and divide each other, that is, there is no difference between an FT in your hand and an FT in mine.\n\nNon homogeneous tokens, namely NFT, are unique and inseparable tokens, and each token is unique. Therefore, mapping the works to the blockchain to generate NFT is equivalent to giving it a unique, authentic and permanent identity, which is the key credential to realize the original authentication, and relying on the tamper proof and traceable blockchain technology, it can realize the real record of the whole process of the subsequent transaction flow information of the works, so as to realize the effective ownership of digital works.\n\nThe second is to “crack down on piracy”.\n\n“Infringement relief difficulty” has always been an important problem perplexing network copyright protection. It is difficult to prove, identify and remedy. Under the meta universe technology, if you suspect that your work has been plagiarized, you can find all relevant information in the blockchain, including the information of the creator, “who created what content at what time”, as well as the relevant information of other subjects’ use and possession of the work. At this time, you can take the relevant records as judicial evidence. This change has undoubtedly greatly reduced the cost of proof for the parties.\n\nThe third is “revenue recovery”.\n\nIn the traditional art trade, once the works are sold, they can only get a one-time return. However, in the form of meta universe, since the transaction link can be executed through smart contract, each transaction can be recorded automatically, which makes it possible for the creator to “get a share” from each subsequent circulation of the work. In the smart contract, the creator can agree on a certain proportion of subsequent revenue sharing, so the payment of each transaction can be automatically withdrawn to his account in each re circulation of the work.\n\nIt can be predicted that with the continuous maturity of metauniverse technologies such as NFT and blockchain, the solution of traditional copyright problems will completely open the digital content market, and the whole links of production, circulation and distribution of works will be reshaped.\n\n02\n\nThe risk of heat to scald needs to be paid attention to\n\nAlthough metacosmic technologies such as NFT have great advantages in stimulating the vitality of original ecology and promoting the reform and innovation of art market, they also have problems and risks that can not be underestimated.\n\nFirst of all, as the saying goes, the ideal is full and the reality is skinny. Although metauniverse has great potential to subvert the digital content market, it is still a long way from the realization of the vision.\n\nTo realize the copyright protection of metacosmic works, the key is to “link the works”. However, as the blockchain technology is not yet fully mature, the larger the file of NFT works, the higher the storage cost on the chain. Therefore, at present, most NFT artworks are still stored in the form of off chain. In this case, they can only rely on the centralized server. Once the server is attacked, the security of the works will be greatly threatened.\n\nAnd even if we can “work on the chain”", "timestamp": 1653246048, "digest": "qaIzTjGb6c59V2XgwcvWPoAQz79rlLlV4n_WMqXvfOA", "contributor": "0x92Cce496362F3039d7746BCBEE0aDfA08ca98bDb"}

In the first half of 2018, China made many new breakthroughs and discoveries in the field of science. These new achievements continue to refresh the public’s perception of science and technology, and are also changing our lives.\n\nThe world’s first individual cell cloned monkey was born in China, which has a new prospect for the treatment of major brain diseases\n\nThe picture shows the somatic cloned monkeys “Zhongzhong” and “Huahua” provided by the Chinese Academy of Sciences\n\nAt a press conference held on January 24 this year, the Chinese Academy of Sciences announced that China has achieved somatic cloning of non-human primates for the first time in the world. Cell, an international academic journal of biology, published this achievement as a cover article and was published online on January 25, 2018. This achievement marks that China has taken the lead in opening a new era of using somatic cloned monkeys as experimental animal models, and has realized the transformation of China from international “parallel” to “leading” in the field of non-human primate research.\n\nIn addition to being of great significance in basic research, this achievement also contributes to solving the major challenges in the field of population health in China. It is reported that the use of somatic cell cloning technology to make brain disease model monkeys has brought unprecedented bright prospects for the mechanism research, intervention, diagnosis and treatment of major brain diseases faced by humans.\n\nChinese scientists took the lead in discovering the activation mechanism of human embryos, laying a foundation for eugenics\n\nIn March this year, the Beijing Genomics Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in cooperation with a number of domestic scientific research institutions, revealed the mystery of orderly gene expression, development and evolution of human embryos for the first time in the world. The research results were published in the international academic journal Cell.\n\nResearch shows that almost all kinds of cells in human body have a large number of gene expression. However, about two days after human fertilization is very special, during which there is almost no gene expression in the embryo. Scientists have found the key molecule that initiates the expression of the human genome (Oct4), and found that in the history of evolution, the first gene (old gene) will be expressed first, while the last gene will often be expressed later. The study also revealed an important new mechanism of human evolution. Scientific research shows that DNA mutation will cause human evolution. There is a kind of DNA fragment called transposon in the DNA sequence. They often jump from one region to another, which will produce DNA mutation. The research results have opened the door to understanding the gene expression regulation of human embryonic development, and will provide a theoretical basis for human eugenics.\n\nThe birth of the world’s first neurological disease model pig promotes the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other diseases\n\nThe picture shows the knock in pig of Huntington’s chorea gene. Source: Popular Science China\n\nAccording to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, after four years of efforts, the international research team led by Guangdong scientists successfully bred the world’s first case of Huntington’s chorea gene knockin pig by using gene editing technology (CRISPR / cas9) and somatic cell nuclear transfer technology for the first time. It can accurately simulate human neurodegenerative diseases, provide stable and reliable animal models for the treatment of Huntington’s chorea, Alzheimer’s disease and other diseases, and promote drug screening and treatment plan formulation. The results were published online in the journal Cell in the early morning of March 30, Beijing time.\n\nAs the world’s first case of Huntington’s disease gene knock into the pig model, the researchers introduced that it will promote the development of the pharmaceutical R & D industrial chain of large animal disease model in China, and promote the R & D process of new drugs for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, as well as immune deficiency, tumor and metabolic diseases. At the same time, the animal model can be used for preclinical evaluation of stem cell therapy and other means, and ultimately benefit mankind.\n\nScientists have discovered more than 100 gene loci that affect human hair color, making it possible for more accurate forensic DNA phenotypic characterization\n\nThe picture is provided by the Chinese Academy of Sciences for hair color classification for genome-wide association analysis\n\nScientists from the Beijing Genomics Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and scientific research institutions in several other countries have newly discovered more than 100 genes that affect human hair color, breaking the previous understanding that human hair color is mainly determined by several known genes, which helps to accurately predict the hair color of unknown criminals through DNA. The research results were published in the international journal Nature Genetics.\n\nPrevious researchers believe that human hair color is mainly determined by several known genes. This study shows that in addition to the known genes, hair color is affected by more than 100 newly discovered genetic loci. Human hair color prediction based on the newly discovered loci has higher accuracy, is conducive to guiding the follow-up study of human complex phenotypic genetics, and provides the possibility for more accurate forensic DNA phenotypic characterization.\n\nChinese scientists first revealed that the atomic resolution image and magic number effect of hydrated ions can shorten the battery charging time and increase the battery power\n\nAfter obtaining the world’s first sub molecular level resolved image of water molecules in 2014, Jiang Ying’s scientific research team, a professor at the quantum material science center of the school of physics of Peking University, obtained the atomic level resolved image of hydrated sodium ions for the first time in the world, and found a magic number effect of hydrated ion transport. The results were published in the international academic journal Nature on May 14.\n\nThe results show that the transport of ions in the confined environment or nanofluids can be controlled by changing the symmetry and periodicity of the surface lattice, so as to selectively enhance or weaken the transport capacity of certain ions, which has important potential significance for many related application fields, such as ion batteries, anti-corrosion, electrochemical reaction, seawater desalination, biological ion channels and so on. “ In addition, the experimental technology of the research exhibition has also pushed the research accuracy of hydration interaction to the atomic level for the first time. It is expected to be applied to more and wider hydrate systems and open up a new research field in the future.\n\nChina has successfully developed the first fully automatic stem cell induction and culture equipment in the world, laying the equipment foundation for regenerative medicine and precision medicine\n\nThe picture is provided by Chinese Academy of Sciences on the operation console of automatic stem cell induction and culture equipment\n\nThe development of the national major scientific research equipment development project “fully automatic stem cell induction and culture equipment” undertaken by Guangzhou Institute of biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, marks the birth of the world’s first intelligent stem cell induction and culture equipment with no one to stick to and deep neural network.\n\nThis device has completely independent intellectual property rights and is established from cell culture", "timestamp": 1653246605, "digest": "RwE_AEMYyyl67t4a_OttaqVVpKiEFB3hiILvGI9Rag0", "contributor": "0x7104f44B7296c82E0b055C354B90B01e04403f04"}

Например A\\*\\* (скриншот выше) может продать вам USDT на 100 рублей, не меньше.\n* Способ оплаты - у торговца должен быть указан такой же способ оплаты, как и добавленный вами в настройки, иначе обмен не получится.\n\nПодобрав нужного торговца нажимайте “Купить USDT” и вводите интересующую вас сумму\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8lGfjY1DkxHleKloBthN1.png?height=496&width=789)\n\nНажимайте кнопку “Купить USDT”, после этого вы попадете в торговый чат, где увидите номер карты торговца, на который нужно отправить рубли.\n\nКогда торговец подтвердит, что получил перевод криптовалюта зачислится на ваш счет.\n\n### Продаем крипту\n\nНа панели сверху выбирайте “Продать”, правее выбирайте крипту, которую хотите продать, например крипто доллар BTC и еще правее местную валюту которую хотите получить, например рубль.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/v1dpLQn2r2F9q90HgGtBi.png?height=582&width=1612)\n\nДалее как и с покупкой выбирайте подходящего торговца, обратите внимание на его лимиты и способ оплаты.\n\nПосле нажатия на кнопку “Продать” введите интересующую вас сумму и еще раз нажимайте “Продать”\n\nПосле этого вы попадете в чат с торговцем, дождитесь, когда на вашу карту придут рубли от торговца и только после этого отправляйте ему криптовалюту нажимая на кнопку “Отправить криптовалюту”.\n\n## Обмен крипты на крипту\n\nДопустим вам прислали оплату в BTC и вы хотите зафиксировать свои средства в более стабильной валюте, например USDT (крипто доллар, привязан к курсу доллара США). Тут все довольно просто:\n\nНа верхней панели выбирайте “Торги” и “Конвертировать”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YHt3gGiTXQUtJFEDtPdE-.png?height=875&width=1882)\n\nОткроется окно, в котором нужно выбрать какую крипту вы отдаете (например BTC) и какую хотите получить (например USDT). Вводите интересующую вас сумму и нажимайте кнопку “Конвертировать”. Данный обмен происходит автоматически, без участия человека с другой стороны.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gnzcz1KSwSiDRkdnlXsMc.png?height=618&width=752)\n\nГотово, вы обменяли биткоин на крипто доллар и теперь можете обменять его на рубли по достаточно стабильному курсу, либо использовать в любых других целях.\n\n## Перевести крипту на биржу\n\nЕсли вы не покупали крипту самостоятельно, а хотите получить перевод от другого человека не ваш счет на бирже, сделать это можно так:\n\nНа верхней панели находите кнопку “Активы” и там нажимайте “Пополнить”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7DBEkXyvgM5_NPINHrrIK.png?height=647&width=1874)\n\nДалее выбирайте интересующую вас валюту и (ОЧЕНЬ ВАЖНО!) сеть, из которой вы будете ее получать. Например биткоин (BTC) можно получить в основной сети BTC-Bitcoin или в сети BTC-Lightning. Уточняйте у отправителя средств как именно он будет это делать и только после этого сообщайте ему адрес для перевода.\n\nВыглядит окно пополнения так:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AQb2ktkyPOKVGNYH0ng4M.png?height=753&width=613)\n\nУвидеть список ваших активов на бирже можно в разделе “Мои активы”, он находится в меню “Активы” на верхней панели. Пополнение можно осуществлять так же из этого раздела.\n\n```\nЕсли материал оказался для вас полезным,\nможете отправить мне пару монет на кофе:\n0x354d4D759c49094f60D537bfD7177c05b70c20cC\n```", "timestamp": 1653247417, "digest": "VCx4yc_PzewAga7ECLmYKQiJq0eNZPsx22VGMPwSy2U", "contributor": "0x354d4D759c49094f60D537bfD7177c05b70c20cC"}

{"id": "Bg7XBcvo3Ac_cUo4yuYWu9jzNCmZWejoVDtAapg9nbA", "title": "How we found our Teddy :)", "body": "Last summer Sam FaceTime'd me & was talking to me about NFT’s. I knew what NFT’s were before we had that conversation but just never paid attention to it. He said : bro this space is perfect for you, don’t ask me why just go on twitter & join any NFT twitter space and you’ll find your journey, I am so excited to see where this story goes from here…\n\nI still remember saying : bro it’s 4 in the morning rn on a Saturday night and you’re telling me to go on twitter space rn and follow some monkey’s??? lol\n\nIn my mind I was like this dude’s lit & out of his right frame of mind. Finishing our sentences he said Teddy trust me, I know you and I am telling you this is a one way ticket to the life you have always dreamed but never lived and opportunities like this are very hard to find. I just laughed at it and I was like I’ll think about it and let you know…\n\nThen after a week I was playing soccer with Shadow in my backyard thinking about what Sam said the other day and tbh I enjoyed hearing him & everything he had to say with enthusiasm over the potential of NFT’s. Btw Sam is a well known artist in the space, and now after spending all this time in this space I get it why he was hyper that day. Anyways, then I went on my twitter and switched my profile form private to public. I joined my first twitter space, It was with @NFTPrince & NFTsquirrels. Both are living legends and I respect them a lot. They shared tons of selfless advice to me on first day without even knowing who I was, what my real name is, or how I looked like. The knowledge was so valuable that basically I’ve never been rugged / scammed in this space till date. \n\nAfter spending some time in different spaces and observing how everything is working in this ecosystem, I focused on the fundamentals, the way people interact and react with certain things, what values they carried, and how do they find their feeling of importance. It was’nt very difficult for me to figure these things out because of my knowledge & experience with Social Media for over 5 years. I grew 36 million+ followers on Instagram via different entertainment pages and a network of over 250 million+ followers via networking in less than 6 months with just 2,000$ to start with from my college dorm.\n\nDuring that time Bored Ape’s were just flying and they still are but the vibes were immaculate last year you can’t deny that. I literally did a PHD on them and I was just astounded by their story but I was able to relate a lot of it to my life, it was so inspiring and fascinating. I was thinking so much about it, that even in my dreams I was seeing NFT’s all around me and my life changed the night of September 30 when i had that one lucid dream, I decided to do a project to share my story so that others can relate to it and be a part of it. \n\n( Note : This was’nt the main reason for me to do a NFT project. My main goal was and is still the same today that I want to leave this NFT space better than how I found it. )\n\nBack to the story, why Teddy? Well obviously. My friend’s call me Teddy and Teddies have been a part of everyone’s childhood and I believe people will hold on to that tradition forever. They provide us the comfort & companionship, a friend to talk to, and it’s not just kids who benefit from the positive effects of a comforting Teddy squeeze. Teddies are just universal and timeless.\n\nI put all of my traits and character and imagination’s in the art, from my expressions to the way I dress. Some of the assets are added for the aesthetics of the collection. I am not an artist but since I was the character I worked with few freelance artist’s to bring my idea on paper. They asked me for a sketch to give an idea of what I wanted and this is what I sent them lmao 😂😂😂😂😂😂\n\n![ That Yu-Gi-Oh and LV belt part has my heart lmaoooo😭😭😭. Tbh this image is still a lot better than my first one. Btw I am not rich lol, I don't have a AP watch or fancy items.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p7SJwXfpBXm-_G9fiTlu0.jpg?height=1280&width=960)\n\n![This looks decent lol. Lot better than what I came up with.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vxl5Z9dogU0G7wxHt-euI.png?height=1280&width=720)\n\n![That's me on the Left! Dw I am doxed to all our past holder's and lot of people in NFT space know me irl. My identity is just not public in the space atm. I'll reveal it when time is right.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CL1JyGEQS_ynX1v0M1WGn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nBack to the story, so once I got this I reached out to few professional artist’s in my network and I worked with multiple of them to find the perfect Teddy. We wanted to stick with 2D because 3D art is great but the market seemed to be doing well with 2D more than 3D collections. Ofcs art style isn’t the main reason for it but it does play a role. But then I am like let’s take the challenge and create something insane. During the time when I started the project, their were’nt any 3D project’s coming out just yet nor there were any noticeable Teddy Bear collections popping as long as I know. So then we decided to turn this into 3D. During this process one 3D artist reached out to me in my DM’s of one our meme page asking to collab, I am like okay cool lets give it a shot and see what you got. \n\n![This is what he came up with as base model. 💀💀💀](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FcshCcWqBzufElk9puKnW.png?height=772&width=778)\n\nYeah he just lost me on that base model. If ur surprised, I did’nt see this coming either, when I saw it for the first time I was out of words just like you are rn. I seriously had no comments on this image. So yeah I had to say no to that dude and look for another artist. The fact that people fake their LinkedIn and show you proof of work of other artist is just hilarious. So I asked one of my friend on telegram if he knew any artist to connect me and he did. \n\n![Idk tbh, it was just not it.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z3yiJzSTaGmqQdaHZroTJ.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nIt just did’nt feel right going with the full body at this point, gave pfp style a shot and see how it does. Initially the idea was, we will do pfp collection and in a seperate contract and we will give the holders full body version of their Teddy so they have both and can use it the way they like whether to animate or so with the source file…\n\n![I finally said yes to this one and made a deal with the artist and gave her an upfront amount for her time that we both agreed on. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ef-d0SnN5nrZH4EpHIfbn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThe decided to upfront because she told me she had financial instability and urgently need of money for rent and expenses so she would’nt be able to work full time on this project and it would take lot longer to complete the collection than what I was expecting. Plus I genuinely wanted to help her regardless of if she would work for the project or not due to her situation. \n\n![My mind, Her ability.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q7q8YdENYDP5zDlajLh05.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nWe decided to fully render and rigg the collection in the end after all the traits and assets are illustrated and confirmed so that their isn't any confusions and nothing is left out. But unfortunately when she submitted, the quality of collection turned out terrible atleast from my pov. I communicated it with our community and told them that ‘guys we do not have the collection fully rigged and its in between 2D and 3D so we would have to pause the project for now until we find another artist and see how things go from there’. \n\nBut then I was also out of funds because I put everything I had in the project initially. So I communicated this with the community in our discord and 34 people ended up minting 100 regardless of the situation. 10 were minted for team and 1 was minted by me personally to participate in the process just like any other member of community. They knew that mint had zero value and won’t have a secondary market value but yet they still supported. So that moment onwards my belief in the project became even stronger and quitting was never an option no matter what situation I go through. The collection won’t ever be revealed because I don’t believe in trying to sell some bullshit to people just to pocket some eth. In trying to sell NFT’s I am not going to sell my character, tf I look like? ZagaBond? There is a big fat difference between failing and abandoning your project. We don’t give up around here…This project is my dream and it like a child to me. I want to be the best out there in anything I do in life. Whether if it is playing soccer or anything that I hold dear too I give my absolute best to win. When I play soccer I don’t play to just participate I play to make difference, I play to dominate the field. \n\n[https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub](https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub)\n\nSo yeah that was my first failure in NFT space, I learned a lot from that failure. The most important thing was that when starting a business do everything you can to gather great people that have the same drive & BELIEVE IN YOUR VISION as you do. Because in the end all a business is a group of people dedicated to provide service or product to people. Take care of your team like your family & they’ll take care of your business & customers. \n\nThen after I did an outreach again and managed to find a team of 4 professional 3D artist’s. Their past ventures have involved working with brands like Puma, Bangs and Lulu Lemon. Their Identities are anon as they wish to keep it that way but I have confirmed the veracity of their credentials. When I presented this entire idea and vision of the collection to them, after hearing me they instantly said yes and told be that we believe in you and we’re gonna make the best collection of 2022. We started working on it the same day and even with this team, I worked 1 on 1 with the team over screen shares for every single trait’s and asset’s and outcomes are just fantastic. Look It does’nt matter what people think of it but we do believe it is one of the greatest NFT collections that will ever be deployed on Blockchain. We’ve put our blood, sweat and tears in this collection as a team day in and day out. The collection is timeless & it will age well I can make that one promise for sure. \n\n![This collection is dedicated to someone who does'nt need to own it. It's a dream come true. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wKl-h3xgt9G73xjvxW_7_.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThere is no bigger feeling than making your dream come true and the story will never have an end to be honest. I am just the captain of the boat as of now but at some point I want to hand the dream over to the community in a position that even if I am not present the story live forever as long as their is imagination left in this world. \n\nBig hug & Thank you for your time and consideration for reading this. I genuinely appreciate your presence here with all my heart.

Zhurong found signs of recent water activity on Mars", "body": "◎ science and Technology Daily reporter Lu Chengkuan\n\nChinese scientists have found signs of water activity on Mars.\n\nOn May 11, science progress published an important research result on Martian water activities. Based on the short wave infrared spectrum and navigation Terrain Camera data obtained by the Mars rover zhurong, Chinese researchers found a plate-shaped bright colored rock similar to sedimentary rock on the surface of Mars. Further analysis found that these plate-shaped bright colored rocks are rich in minerals such as water bearing sulfate.\n\nThis marks the first time that zhurong international has used the short wave infrared spectrometer on the rover to detect water bearing minerals in situ on Mars.\n\n“The discovery of signs of water activity in the relatively young geological age landing area of zhurong indicates that the Martian hydrosphere during the Amazon period may be more active than previously thought. This discovery is of great significance to understand the evolution history of Martian climate and environment.” Liu Yang, the first author and corresponding author of the paper and researcher of the National Space Science Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said.\n\nThe zhurong Mars rover carried by China’s first Mars exploration mission tianwen-1 successfully landed in the southern region of Utopia plain on May 15, 2021. Up to now, the Mars rover zhurong has been traveling in the utopian plain in the northern lowlands of Mars for one year, with a total of nearly 2000 meters, and has obtained a large number of valuable scientific exploration data.\n\nThe existing dating work of the impact crater shows that the landing area of the Mars rover zhurong is located in the Amazon stratum after the later reconstruction event. During the Amazon period, the climate of Mars has changed from warm and humid to cold and dry. The analysis of orbital remote sensing data shows that a variety of geomorphic features distributed around the landing site indicate that there may have been a large amount of volatile matter in the utopian plain.\n\nHowever, “limited by the spatial resolution and coverage, the orbital remote sensing data did not find water bearing minerals near the landing area, which brings many questions about the formation mechanism of such landforms and the nature of water activities in the area.” Liu Yang said.\n\nThe research team believes that the plate-shaped bright colored rock found by zhurong is a hard shell developed locally in the landing area. Compared with the broken rocks observed in situ by the American pirate 1 Mars Lander, the hard shell in the zhurong landing area seems to be more erosion resistant, and the hard shell layer is relatively thick.\n\n“Forming such a thick hard shell requires a lot of liquid water, which cannot be formed only by water vapor in the atmosphere.” Liu Yang explained.\n\nAt the same time, the study found that there was no obvious surface runoff or river trace in the landing area, and no fluffy surface and salt frost residues formed by water evaporation were found around the inspection route, which ruled out the possibility of large-scale water activities on the surface of the landing area.\n\nIn this regard, the research team proposed a new formation mechanism. This mechanism suggests that the soil weathering layer before the Martian sedimentary period experienced cementation and diagenesis during the rise or infiltration of salt rich groundwater, forming the observed tabular rocks. Salt cements precipitate in capillary pores or groundwater near the water table, and active evaporation and accumulation occur. The intermittent fluctuation of groundwater level may further thicken the hard shell and form layered structure. Subsequently, the topsoil covered on the hard shell is eroded away, exposing the erosion resistant hard shell layer.\n\nLiu Yang said that the discovery of the zhurong Rover showed that the water activity of Mars during the Amazon period may be more active than previously thought. The zhurong landing area and the extensive area of the northern plains of Mars may contain a large amount of available water in the form of hydrous minerals.\n\nReviewed by: Yue Liang", "timestamp": 1653248785, "digest": "_LTu9Jrk_e-jSFs_Naz3_g7DFG5jeNlwoduu392sNwI", "contributor": "0x3e964Ff29b57EB3836b015D1d335906BF6CfBB1f"}

In order to protect their safety, the police of the Beijing Mobile Investigation Corps hid in the crowd and did not miss a trace of trouble. On October 1, national day, the first thief was arrested in Daxing Yizhuang. Yesterday’s Mid Autumn Festival, the police arrested five pickpockets in Orson. Since the national day, all the police of the Beijing Mobile Investigation Corps have stuck to their posts and arrested 32 pickpocketing suspects.\n\nThe first thief Daxing bus station was arrested\n\nSince the national day, when tourists and citizens gather in public places and scenic spots, there are some invisible guards at the entrances and exits of the surrounding bus and subway stations, parks and scenic spots. They look no different from other tourists, but their sharp eyes keep scanning the wind and grass in the crowd, secretly guarding the safety of tourists. They are the police of the mobile Investigation Corps of the Municipal Public Security Bureau.\n\nOn the morning of October 1, the mobile Investigation Corps and the police of Yizhuang police station found two men acting suspiciously while carrying out pickpocketing, patrol and control along the bus in Yizhuang. The police followed the control all the way to nandahongmen bus station. When two men stole a passenger’s mobile phone, they were arrested by the police on the spot. Subsequently, the police seized 6 stolen mobile phones and 1 Wallet (including 2 ID cards and several bank cards) from the car driven by the two suspects.\n\n14 pickpockets were arrested on the same day\n\nAfter examination, the suspects Li and Wang explained the illegal facts of stealing seven mobile phones and one wallet. At present, the two suspects have been criminally detained by Daxing Branch. The case is still under further investigation.\n\nThe reporter of Beijing Youth Daily learned from the mobile Investigation Corps that Li and Wang were the first thieves arrested by Beijing anti pickpocketing police during the national day week.\n\nOn October 1, the whole police of the mobile Investigation Corps of the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched to successively crack 6 pickpocketing cases and 14 pickpocketing suspects in Beijing subway station, Tiananmen Jinshui bridge, Beijing West Railway Station subway, Beihai north railway station, Yuanda Road station and other places.\n\nFive pickpockets in Orson were caught yesterday\n\nYesterday’s Mid Autumn Festival, Beijing was clear and crisp in autumn, which was especially suitable for travel. The Olympic Forest Park has also welcomed tourists from all over the country.\n\nIt is reported that in view of the characteristics of large passenger flow and pickpockets during the Olympic Forest Park Festival, the mobile Investigation Corps and Chaoyang Branch deploy special police forces to jointly carry out pickpocketing operations to escort the people.\n\nAt 2:40 PM, “don’t move, police!” With a loud cry, several plainclothes arrested a man at the entrance of the Olympic Forest Park Station of Metro Line 8. It turned out that the man took advantage of the tourists’ inattention to pick up the camera he was carrying, but he didn’t know that his every move had long been mastered by the anti pickpocketing investigators, who arrested him when he succeeded in pickpocketing.\n\nIt is understood that on October 4, the Mid Autumn Festival, five pickpocketing suspects were arrested around the Olympic Forest Park and are currently under review by Chaoyang Branch.\n\nSince the National Day holiday, all the police of the mobile Investigation Corps of the Municipal Public Security Bureau have stuck to their posts and arrested 32 pickpocketing suspects, which has advantageously ensured the safety of the people.\n\nBeijing police suggest that there are many people traveling during holidays.

{"id": "s5hu9UDyPDRExvoP4Q9tC56wQnWEqQZMubATy4-v4T0", "title": "The recent fluctuation of RMB exchange rate is market correction rather than policy guidance", "body": "The recent fluctuation of RMB exchange rate is market correction rather than policy guidance\n\nLast week (April 18-22), the closing price (i.e. the closing price of the interbank market at 4:30 p.m.) and the central parity of the domestic RMB exchange rate (hereinafter, if not specifically referred to, refer to the RMB exchange rate against the US dollar) fell below 6.40 to 1 on the 20th and 21st, and closed at 6.4875 and 6.4596 on Friday, respectively. The cumulative decline in that week was 1.7% and 1.0% respectively. Both domestic and foreign exchange rates fell below 6.50 on Friday night. Last November, the central bank proposed for the first time that “the degree of deviation is directly proportional to the correction force”. The correction of market forces finally came again.\n\nI guessed this round of RMB exchange rate adjustment again\n\nLast year, when the market was bullish that the RMB exchange rate would rise above 6.0, the author said frankly that this would be a small probability event and “guessed” that the RMB might not go as strong as expected. As a result, even though the multilateral exchange rate of RMB increased significantly throughout the year, the bilateral exchange rate of RMB against the US dollar increased by only slightly more than 2%, and the highest price in the year did not rise below 6.34.\n\nThis year, the author warned of the possible risks of Fed tightening. At the end of February, the author was invited to write an article and put forward seven spillover channels, four impact scenarios and six countermeasures. The article was officially published at the end of March. A few days ago, when I attended the Tsinghua Wudaokou global financial forum, I further pointed out that the tightening of the Fed’s policy is an important factor affecting the trend of the RMB exchange rate this year, and made judgments in four scenarios or four stages.\n\nIn the first scenario or stage, the Federal Reserve will tighten moderately and orderly, the inflow of foreign capital in China will slow down, and the appreciation of RMB will slow down; In the second scenario or stage, the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates more aggressively or even start to shrink the table at the same time, which will cause turbulence in the US economy and financial market, lead to phased capital outflow from China, and the RMB exchange rate will fluctuate in both directions; In the third scenario or stage, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening is stronger than expected, which may puncture the asset foam and trigger an economic recession. China will not be able to survive alone, and the RMB exchange rate will be under pressure again; In the fourth scenario or stage, after the crisis, the Federal Reserve will return to monetary easing. If China can continue to maintain the leading position of economic recovery in the world, it may return to capital return and the RMB exchange rate will be stronger.\n\nAt that time, the author made it clear that China has now smoothly passed the first stage - the Federal Reserve’s reduction in bond purchase, but we should still pay high attention and vigilance to the future, because the development and changes of the situation may be nonlinear. Now it seems that the author is unfortunately right. This wave of RMB exchange rate correction since mid March, especially the cumulative drop of one or two cents in the past three trading days, is an important background for the enhanced tightening expectation of the Federal Reserve. At the same time, this also confirms the author’s research experience that using public information can make trend judgment.\n\nThe recent sharp decline is a concentrated catharsis of market sentiment\n\nSince the beginning of June 2020, the domestic epidemic has been well prevented and controlled, the economy has recovered rapidly, the external dollar index is weak, and the interest rate gap between China and the United States is large. Together, it points to the appreciation of the RMB exchange rate, which has increased by nearly 10% by the end of the year. Last year, the supporting role of factors such as the slowdown of economic recovery, the turmoil of financial markets, the rebound of the US dollar index and the convergence of China US interest rate spread weakened, but the leading prevention and control of the epidemic and the continuation of foreign demand boom drove the RMB exchange rate to continue to appreciate slightly against the rebound of the US index.\n\nAfter the interest rate meeting in March this year, with the further rise of US inflation, the expectation of monetary tightening in the market is becoming stronger and stronger. The US index accelerated its rebound, breaking 100 in mid April; US bond yields soared, superimposed on the differentiation of China US monetary policy, and the interest rate spread between China and the United States converged rapidly or even upside down. Last week, the Fed’s “Eagle Song” was louder. Last Monday, St. Louis Fed chairman Brad publicly proposed a one-time interest rate increase of 75 basis points in May; Last Thursday, Powell said at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that a 50 basis point interest rate increase would be discussed in May, and a similar interest rate increase might be needed to curb inflation; Last Friday, Nomura Securities latest forecast that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by 75 basis points in June and July. Affected by this, the US index stood above 100 last week, the exchange rate of the yen against the US dollar hit a 20-year low, and the exchange rate of the RMB against the yen hit a six-and-a-half-year high.\n\nAt the beginning of March, the RMB exchange rate also hit a new high in recent four years, but there have been signs of adjustment since the middle of the year. At that time, the Risk Spillover of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine was superimposed, the supervision of Chinese stocks was strengthened, the domestic epidemic rebounded sharply, and the RMB exchange rate was quickly corrected, wiping out all the gains in last year, and then fluctuated repeatedly around the level at the end of last year. Recently, due to the spread of the epidemic in a few cities, the problem of smooth economic circulation has become more prominent, which has exacerbated the market’s concerns about domestic economic recovery and export prospects. On April 19, the IMF lowered China’s economic growth forecast for this year by 0.4 percentage points, and the RMB exchange rate fell below 6.40 from that day. On April 22, the middle price and closing price fell by 1.7% and 2.2% respectively compared with the end of last month, and fell by 1.3% and 1.8% respectively compared with the end of last year.\n\nSome people attribute the recent fluctuation of RMB exchange rate to the intentional guidance of the central parity quotation mechanism, which is contrary to the fact. Whether the adjustment in mid and late March or recently, it is driven by the offshore market. The offshore RMB exchange rate (CNH) continued to be weak relative to the onshore RMB exchange rate (CNY). The daily average price difference was 1.5% from March 11 to 31 and 2.7% from April 20 to 22. This reflects that after foreign capital reduced its holdings of domestic RMB financial assets, it purchased foreign exchange in the offshore market, driving the weakness of CNH. In addition, the record low exchange rate of the yen against the US dollar triggered speculation about intervening in the depreciation of the yen. In addition, China’s uncertain economic prospects triggered the closing of the yen carry trade of buying high interest rate RMB assets with low interest rate yen. The resulting foreign exchange purchase accelerated the downward trend of CNH and pushed down CNY. If the central bank is wrong, it is also “wrong”. After the counter cyclical factor is faded out and used, it abides by the transparency principle of the middle price quotation mechanism and does not regulate it.\n\nThe rise and fall of the RMB exchange rate should be viewed with an ordinary mind\n\nFrom the expectation of RMB exchange rate implied in one-year non deliverable forward (NDF), the daily average depreciation expectation was 1.16% from April 20 to 22, up from 0.42% from March 11 to April 19, but not significant, and the highest was only 1.29%. In the future, we should pay attention to whether it converges or diverges.

BiliBili’s share price, which lowered its first quarter net turnover forecast on the evening of May 2, fell by more than 8%.\n\nSince the Internet industry became more strictly regulated in 2021, the share price performance of relevant companies has been weak. But recently, the warm wind in the industry is blowing frequently. Some institutions said that the current domestic policies can effectively ensure the orderly and stable development of the Internet industry, and the prospect is worth looking forward to. China’s Internet has entered a mature and prosperous period, and the leading effect continues to appear.\n\nLiu qiangdong’s reduction of Jingdong health\n\nOn May 4, after the opening of JD health, the share price fell all the way, with a maximum drop of more than 14%. As of the close, the decline narrowed to 10.18%, with a total market value of about HK $1438 billion, an evaporation of nearly HK $16.2 billion from the previous day.\n\nAccording to the equity disclosure data of the Hong Kong stock exchange, Liu qiangdong, founder and chairman of JD group, recently reduced his shareholding in JD health twice, involving about 8.8404 million shares, totaling nearly HK $440 million, which is the first reduction of Liu qiangdong’s shareholding since JD health was listed at the end of 2020. Liu Qiang Dong’s stock was sold at an average price of HK $450 million per share on the day of June, which was about HK $300 million; On April 29, 3.84 million shares were sold at an average price of HK $50.67 per share, cashing out HK $195 million.\n\nAfter the reduction, Liu qiangdong’s shareholding in JD health decreased from 68.94% to 68.66%.\n\nThe annual report shows that JD health’s annual revenue in 2021 was 30.68 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 58.3%; The net loss was 1.07 billion yuan, a year-on-year loss of 17.235 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 93.8%. As of December 31, 2021, the annual number of active users of JD health has reached 123 million, a net increase of 33.56 million compared with the number of active users in 2020.\n\nShen NANPENG’s reduction in meituan\n\nCoincidentally, meituan was also recently reduced by well-known investor Shen NANPENG. Today, its share price once plunged by more than 6%. As of press time, the decline narrowed to 4%, with a total market value of HK $1.02 trillion, an evaporation of nearly HK $50 billion from the previous day.\n\nAccording to the equity information disclosed by the Hong Kong stock exchange, Shen NANPENG, independent non-executive director of meituan and founding managing partner of Sequoia Capital, reduced a total of 42.9572 million shares of meituan last Wednesday (April 27) and last Friday (April 29), cashing out about HK $6.227 billion. Shen NANPENG meituan’s shareholding has decreased from 3.98% to 3.19%.\n\nHong Kong stock Internet giants fell sharply one after another\n\nNot only JD health and meituan, but also Hong Kong stock Internet giants fell sharply today, and the Hang Seng technology index fell by more than 3%. BiliBili fell by more than 8%, Ali health fell by nearly 6%, and jd.com and Kwai fell by more than 4%.\n\nAmong them, bilibilibili issued an update announcement on the guidance of net turnover on the evening of May 2, which lowered the expectation of net turnover in the first quarter. The announcement shows that due to the unexpected spread of the epidemic in China, many cities and regions, including Shanghai, have successively implemented static management since mid March, which has had a certain impact on the overall economy and enterprise operation. Based on this, BiliBili expects the net turnover in the first quarter of 2022 to be between 5 billion yuan and 5.1 billion yuan, and the previously estimated net turnover was between 5.3 billion yuan and 5.5 billion yuan.\n\nBiliBili also said in the announcement that its community continued to grow. The average monthly active users in the first quarter of 2022 was 293.6 million, a year-on-year increase of 31.5%; The average daily active users were 79.4 million, a year-on-year increase of 32%. In the first quarter, the average daily use time of a single user was up to 95 minutes, reaching the highest record since the operation of station B.\n\nSince 2021, the Internet industry has become more strictly regulated, the share price performance of relevant companies has plummeted, the Hang Seng technology index has fallen all the way, and the investor sentiment is also relatively low. But recently, Internet stocks have been blowing. Haitong Securities said that the current domestic policies can effectively ensure the orderly and stable development of the Internet industry, and the prospect is worth looking forward to. China’s Internet has entered a mature and prosperous period, and the leading effect continues to appear.\n\nLooking forward to the future, Zheng Jian, assistant fund manager of ChuangJin Hexin, said that at present, mainstream Chinese Internet companies still generally have a valuation allowance of about 30% compared with their American counterparts, and their valuation is also outside the two standard deviations of the five-year average valuation, which belongs to a more attractive stage of valuation. The repeated interest rate hikes in Russia and Ukraine had a great impact on the US market in the first half of the year. From the perspective of fundamentals, we believe that the performance of the industry in the second half of this year will be better than that in the first half of this year, and the performance driven growth will prevail in the second half of this year. Therefore, we are optimistic about the allocation value of Hang Seng technology index for a long time.\n\nThe exclusive investment gift package under the rebound market!

(content source: Elle Chinese website)\n\nRecently, when Guan Xiaotong attended the event, he wore a blue sweater with a checkered skirt and collided with American cutting-edge supermodel Kaia Geber!\n\nLooking at their whole body photos, I suddenly found that in addition to hitting their shirts, they were eye-catching, and their big long legs hit each other!\n\nRecently, Guan Xiaotong attended the award ceremony of Weibo night. A neat mini dress with silver high heels also found a very similar match in Gaia’s activity dress. The most important thing is that when they appear, they are more concerned about what they wear. Visually, the two meter long legs have been amazing, and the reincarnation of leg essence is probably the same!\n\nBecause they have the same good figure against the sky and the same youthful vitality, they have a high similarity in dressing.\n\nSkirt chapter\n\nWith such a pair of good legs, they naturally prefer short skirts.\n\nThe shorter the skirt, the longer the leg. It is 100% applicable to two people.\n\nWhen we wore small dresses on formal occasions, we found that both of them had chosen small dresses with short front and long back. The long skirts were grand and the short skirts were energetic, showing their good figure.\n\nBut in the daily choice of medium and long skirts, we also found the differences between the two.\n\nGuan Xiaotong prefers A-line skirts above the knee, just like a clever and sweet girl next door.\n\nGaia Geber prefers the knee length skirt with straight tube, and the high waist element directly means the visual sense of “legs below the chest”.\n\nTrousers\n\nIn the choice of trousers, both of them are the routine of “long legs, willful and casual wear”, which only wants people to shout “God is unfair”.\n\nIf you think Guan Xiaotong’s long legs are just the same after reading the dress in front, please take a look at Guan Xiaotong who wears shorts to know what leg essence is. Casual jacket with denim shorts, general matching routine, unusual long legs.\n\nPerhaps there is no truth that “Cowboy SHORTS show long legs”, but Cowboy SHORTS are placed on long legs.

If you can meet at a street corner many years later, I hope you can recognize me at a glance. I used to be my best friend.\n\nPolite greetings\n\n01\n\nToday, when I was brushing the circle of friends, I suddenly saw the news of a junior high school classmate getting married. In the photo, he became a lot more handsome, not like the big fool in junior high school at all. And he is one of the best partners I played in junior high school.\n\nWe have a dormitory. We have to go back together after class, eat and play ball together, and even go to the bathroom. We said we would be good brothers for a lifetime, but in high school and college, we all went to different places and schools, and gradually had less contact. Until today, my good brother got married, but I didn’t know.\n\nI sent him a “happy wedding” message. I didn’t receive a “thank you” until just now. I wanted to say something more, but I didn’t know where to start and what to say. It seems that there are only some polite greetings left.\n\nPass by\n\n02\n\nAlong the way, we met many people, some of whom passed by when they became partners, while others passed by when they became partners.\n\nThe childhood sweetheart who quarreled over who should be the father and who should be the mother; The little sister who dances rubber bands with you and puts on makeup for the doll; The troublemaker who plays marbles with you and secretly pulls the girl’s hair. Do you remember these people in those years? Do you still have contact?\n\nTime goes on and people go in all directions. Maybe some people just walk away. We always grow up in thinking, grow up in habit and forget in habit. Just like when I first went to college, I always miss my high school classmates, but I also met new classmates and new friends while I miss them, and those old classmates we miss also have new companionship.\n\nSome people accompany her to class instead of us, some people eat with her instead of us, and some people talk gossip with her instead of us, watch Korean dramas, laugh and cry together. Her circle of friends is no longer a lonely selfie and sad words. Gradually, there are group photos of eating, singing and watching movies together, just like the group photos of eating, singing and watching movies together. But now, we don’t know the people and places in the photos, and the comments are gradually less, until there is only an occasional love.\n\nAt the same time, we are also busy shuttling around in the new environment, taking the postgraduate entrance examination, or playing games with new friends. Every night is no longer holding a mobile phone to chat with old classmates, and no longer need to ask you how you are doing and how you are doing. After all, your circle of friends has explained everything.\n\nI don’t know when we began to have less contact. Our chat also moved from the chat box to the circle of friends, then looked at it, and then brushed it calmly until we finally had nothing to say from the initial nothing to the present nothing to say.\n\nIt dispersed as we walked\n\n03\n\nAdults often say that old classmates should keep in touch. You still have contact with junior high school classmates. What’s the one who used to come to our house to play now. Sorry, I really can’t answer some questions, because we haven’t been in touch for a long time. I don’t know whether I’m too ruthless or time is too meaningless. In short, we are drifting away in the torrent of time.\n\nFriendship may be a phased product, and some people are destined to accompany us only for a period of time. Just like when I studied in Spain, I also met many friends who played very well, but then I returned home and they stayed there. In this way, we seem to be people in two completely different worlds. I said we should prepare for the final exam tomorrow, and he said he was preparing for the Christmas holiday.\n\nWhen the stage of our common life is over, we move towards a new beginning, have a new environment, new friends, and perhaps the feelings we once had are fading quietly. We chat less and less, and our chat words are shorter and shorter. You have your new world and I have my new life.\n\nOccasionally in the circle of friends to see the dynamics of old friends, think of our crazy days together, want to talk a few words, but don’t know where to start. After all, for a long time, sometimes I really don’t know what to say, and what else belongs to our common topic. After all, the memory will gradually fade until the last sentence is “really, I don’t remember”.\n\nYoung and frivolous\n\n04\n\nIndeed, time has changed our appearance, but it has also lengthened our distance. Fortunately, my young frivolous has your participation, and your love is accompanied by me.\n\nDear old friends, maybe we don’t have much contact now, but please believe I’ve never forgotten you. The happy songs and laughter you have brought me will still emerge one after another when I revisit my hometown. The future that I can’t participate with you will still bless silently in the distance.\n\nIf you can meet at a street corner many years later, I hope you can recognize me at a glance.

According to the report of securities times · e company, on May 10, some production lines of BYD Changsha factory have been shut down for rectification. In the past two months, thousands of residents in more than a dozen communities around BYD’s factory in Yuhua District, Changsha jointly reported that they often smell strong paint smell. According to Phoenix technology, the paint smell is the most serious from the evening to the early morning, and hundreds of children have experienced unexplained epistaxis. After the topic of “suspected nosebleed of many children caused by BYD factory pollution” was put on the hot search, on the same day of May 7, BYD Changsha Yuhua District Industrial Park issued a statement, which did not deny the existence of peculiar smell around the factory and said that “the company has taken relevant measures and actively improved it”. However, for the situation of “nosebleed caused by excessive emission”, the statement said that “it is a malicious fabricated Association and has been reported to the police.” On May 8, the Changsha Government Affairs official account “couch cloth” issued a document saying that the Changsha Municipal Party committee and government had set up an investigation team and stationed in BYD Yuhua District factory to investigate. Relevant media reports pointed out that the source of the odor, or the coating workshop of BYD Yuhua District factory. In fact, BYD has a “criminal record” in this regard. In 2019, Changsha BYD was regarded as a key complained enterprise and included in the key supervision object due to the impact of pollutants discharged from the production waste gas of the spraying workshop on the lives of nearby residents. An employee of a car company in Beijing told boxed lunch finance that painting, electroplating and other links will indeed affect the environment. “Because of environmental protection requirements, we have no painting factories in Beijing, and the corresponding businesses are given to factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai.” According to Chinese philanthropists, citing the views of people in the automobile industry, the coating process of automobile production will produce a large number of pollutants. If not handled properly, it will have an impact on the surrounding atmosphere and water. Among them, the paint waste gas mainly comes from the volatile waste gas produced by the organic solvent contained in the paint during spraying and drying, which is called volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and the main components are benzene, toluene, xylene, etc. The employees of the above car enterprises also said that there was no corresponding fact and it was impossible to confirm that the odor came from BYD production line. China Securities Journal reported on May 8 that some peculiar smell near the factory may be diesel exhaust and engine oil, and the source of the peculiar smell cannot be confirmed. In an interview with China Securities Journal, the staff of the Management Committee of Changsha Yuhua Economic Development Zone said, “we will find a third-party testing institution recognized by the surrounding residents to participate… But the truth needs to be carefully investigated.” 01\n\nWhen buying a car, few consumers will be aware of the pollution behind the beautiful appearance of the car. Painting on the car surface has two functions: one is decoration, and the other is to protect the car body from corrosion; But on the other hand, coating is also a serious part of exhaust gas in automobile production process. “Paint smell” is the core of the public opinion storm around BYD. Before that, there were many disputes about its coating workshop. In 2019, Changsha BYD was complained about waste gas pollution in the spraying workshop and was included in the key supervision object of local relevant departments. According to a document on the official website of Hunan Provincial Department of ecological environment, the serious paint smell in the coating workshop of BYD Yuhua District factory is basically true, and the document date is May 8, 2021. According to an EIA report in December 2021, the waste gas from the electrophoresis process in the coating workshop was directly and unorganized discharged by BYD Changsha factory in the early stage without collection. In addition, the types and values of 24 organic substances in the report were not disclosed. In three years, the problem of coating workshop has not been solved. BYD’s environmental protection issues have always been highly concerned. Since November 2011, BYD and its affiliated companies have been punished by relevant departments for environmental protection for many times. The reasons for punishment include excessive toluene discharge, excessive exhaust gas discharge, direct discharge of wastewater and other issues. Not only BYD, but also its competitor Tesla has recently attracted criticism for paint related problems. According to foreign media electek reported on May 4, the German environmental protection organization Green Alliance asked to revoke the business license of Tesla’s super factory in Berlin, Germany after learning of a serious paint leakage accident. Previously, the organization had asked the local court to stop the Tesla Berlin plant project for reasons such as deforestation and water resources control, which is also a major reason why Tesla didn’t get the business license of the local plant until this year. Electek quoted German media rbb24 as saying that the 15000 liters of paint leaked by Tesla had been properly handled, and only 2 to 3 liters fell on the road and solidified during loading. The leakage is considered to have slight harm to the water body. Although it did not enter the sewage or sewer system in the end, the green alliance still requires relevant institutions to revoke Tesla’s factory license until Tesla completes the laying of some unpaved areas around the paint workshop to prevent dangerous materials from entering the aquifer. A source disclosed to electek that the coating workshop is the main bottleneck of the production capacity of Tesla Berlin super factory. In the past two years, Tesla, weixiaoli and other auto companies have expanded their factories in China. Why is only BYD involved in the vortex of pollution? At present, the investigation of relevant facts has not been completed, but many industry people in contact with boxed lunch finance believe that too close to residential areas and the rapid expansion of production capacity are two possible factors. According to the national standard for health protection distance of automobile manufacturers, considering the influence of wind direction, terrain and other factors, the distance between the factory and the residential area should range from 300m to 500m. Some residents involved in the incident are only one road away from the factory, only 40 to 50 meters away, and the nearby Jiahe school is only 300 meters away from the factory. According to a research report of the environmental protection organization green Jiangnan and Public Environment Research Center (IPE), in 2016, a Toyota supplier was fined 100000 yuan by the local regulatory authorities for being complained by surrounding residents about excessive exhaust gas. The report shows that the supplier’s factory is only one road from the residential area. If the factory is too close to the residential area, it is easy to affect the living conditions of residents. Other new car building forces have also considered relevant factors in the site selection of self built factories. Take Xiaopeng as an example. Xiaopeng’s self built factory is located in Zhaoqing, Guangzhou. According to the environmental impact report of Zhaoqing Xiaopeng automobile intelligent network technology industrial park project released by Zhaoqing high tech network, the recent residential areas and", "timestamp": 1653249819, "digest": "tKJe_GwMUjlKaJucsGSOtt3bN22g8zfIlKZp8E2we8c", "contributor": "0xC22CbeF481FfC030331bACEb3D34c94bc45cc30C"}

When the baby’s awareness of defecation control has not yet occurred, physiological needs dominate. Defecation is a reflex activity. If the defecation reflex is often inhibited, it will gradually make the rectum lose its normal sensitivity to fecal pressure stimulation. Children around the age of 1 often neglect to excrete feces because of fun, so that the feces stay in the large intestine for too long, and the water in the feces is absorbed and becomes dry and hard. As a result, it is not easy to excrete, which is also one of the most common reasons for constipation. It is important to establish good defecation habits as soon as possible and develop the habit of regular defecation in the morning. It must be noted that children’s self-control awareness of defecation is formed earlier than that of urination.\n\nAfter seven months, the child has learned to sit independently and sit more stably. Generally, children behave before defecation. They may suddenly turn red around their eyes, daze in their eyes, twist their body, turn their corners of their mouth to both sides, and even fart. At this time, you can practice your child’s defecation in the basin, and adults can hold him on one side. Once the child has defecated, he must be kissed to let the child gradually know that his parents like this defecation and feel comfortable. After that, every day, parents put their children on the bedpan to defecate at about the same time, and use language and expression to signal their children to defecate hard downward. A few weeks later, as soon as the child sits on the bedpan, his nervous system will produce a conditioned reflex and urge him to defecate hard downward, so as to form a good habit of defecating in the bedpan every day. After the age of 1, gradually train children to express their need to defecate in language. Such training will take some time. Parents should be patient. If properly trained, children can complete toilet training around the age of 2.\n\nTry to arrange the time of defecation in the morning. The time of sitting in the basin each time should be about 5 minutes, not more than 10 minutes, so as not to cause the child’s disgust. After the child is 1 year old, you can buy a small toilet ring and put it on the adult’s big toilet ring to train the child to sit in the toilet and defecate. If parents train well and there is no special change in diet, children will defecate at a fixed time. Generally speaking, children can control their urine and urine well only at the age of 2 \\~ 2.5.", "timestamp": 1653250340, "digest": "IQo029_tyOLxk-riEX8ggJ1_KTnMcvHikLxlqpqMYYU", "contributor": "0xa49812D5EFc028469701b34F49101008960Bf796"}

From scheme design to construction, China has created one by one, breaking the limit of the world’s Offshore Bridge Engineering.\n\nThe total length of the Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge is about 55 kilometers, of which the main works include 22.9 kilometers of bridges, 6.7 kilometers of subsea tunnels and east-west artificial islands connecting tunnels and bridges.\n\nCCTV reporter Wu Jie: my current position is the dongrengong island of the Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge. Above my head are the dense takeoff and landing routes of the Hong Kong International Airport. Behind me is the busy golden waterway on Lingdingyang. Many bridge experts believe that it is almost an impossible task to link the core areas of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao and avoid affecting the sea and air transportation here.\n\nIn order to realize the non-interference of sea, land and air traffic, the Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge adopts the world’s first integrated scheme of bridge, island and tunnel. On the vast sea, engineers surrounded two artificial islands of 100000 square meters with 120 huge steel cylinders with a diameter of 22 meters and a height of 18 floors. The whole project took only 212 days.\n\nThe 6.7-kilometer-long subsea tunnel is composed of 33 large immersed tubes docked on the seabed. Each immersed tube weighs more than 80000 tons, which is equivalent to an aircraft carrier, and the accuracy of immersed tube docking should reach the centimeter level. These are unprecedented technological innovations in the history of bridge construction in the world\n\nSu quanke, chief engineer of Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge Authority: bridges, tunnels and artificial islands are accurately manufactured in factories, and large-scale equipment is pulled over and installed. Therefore, the quality of this bridge is very high, which pushes China’s bridge construction to the level of industrial construction. We were very surprised that foreign experts could come to China to build bridges at this time.\n\nIn terms of the overall bridge design, the main bridge of Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge is largely constructed of prefabricated steel structure, with a total steel consumption of 420000 tons, which is enough to build ten bird nests. The exquisite construction technology makes the service life of the bridge up to 120 years, which is 20 years longer than the common design service life of sea crossing bridges in the world, and has become a new benchmark for bridge construction in the world.\n\nTan Guoshun, project manager of Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge project of China Railway Bridge Bureau: the requirements for the accuracy of each component are higher and higher. If the deviation is large, it can’t be installed. The requirement of 1 cm deviation (installation) proposed by Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge is unimaginable in the process of large-scale engineering construction in the world. The technical standard of Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge is much higher than that of any country in the world.\n\nAfter the completion and opening of the Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge, the land transportation from Hong Kong to Zhuhai will be reduced from the previous three hours to 30 minutes. This super project on Lingdingyang will rewrite the economic territory of the Pearl River Delta and lay a solid foundation for the integration of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao.", "timestamp": 1653250485, "digest": "iErnMQYUcnubiVyMlbHffpCFzgnvZf4wyH8Ps-Tmfd8", "contributor": "0xa10509Ce5fcC91169CeB5b07298598aab5c03A7a"}

What is the hidden worry of lithium iron phosphate surplus?", "body": "“In 2022, due to the shortage of raw materials, the arrival of overcapacity will be delayed to a certain extent. After 2023, with the gradual easing of the tight supply of lithium carbonate, the problem of overcapacity will be faced at that time.”\n\nAfter nearly two years of rapid development, lithium iron phosphate cathode material seems to be sliding to the quagmire of overcapacity step by step.\n\nAccording to Gaogong lithium battery, from January to March 2022 alone, there were 9 domestic projects involving lithium iron phosphate materials, with a planned capacity of 1.19 million tons. The chairman of a listed company of lithium battery cathode materials said, “our demand is at the level of millions of tons, while the supply starts at more than millions of tons.” The fund manager of a new energy industry in Shanghai also believes that “due to the large increase of production capacity, the capacity of lithium iron phosphate may be surplus in the second half of 2022.”\n\nWhen will the situation of excess capacity of lithium iron phosphate appear? What impact will it have on the upstream and downstream enterprises of the industrial chain?\n\nNew and old players compete to expand production, and the planned production capacity far exceeds the demand\n\nBenefiting from the rapid development of new energy vehicles and energy storage industry, China’s lithium iron phosphate battery shipment exceeded 160gwh in 2021, with a year-on-year increase of more than 150%; Lithium iron phosphate cathode material shipments 470000 tons, an increase of 277%.\n\nCinda Securities said that under the influence of the rapid rise of raw material prices and the decline of subsidies, the cost advantage of battery materials is highlighted. Lithium iron phosphate will continue its rapid growth trend in 2022. It is estimated that the global demand for lithium iron phosphate will reach 1.81 million tons by 2025.\n\nHowever, according to the incomplete statistics of battery China, the expanded production scale of lithium iron phosphate announced by various manufacturers and the existing production capacity have exceeded 5 million tons, and the planned production capacity is significantly higher than the demand.\n\nIt is reported that the production expansion of lithium iron phosphate cathode materials mainly comes from three types of manufacturers:\n\n1) Manufacturers whose main business is lithium iron phosphate, such as German nano (300769. SZ), Hunan Yuneng, etc.\n\n2) Chemical enterprises with lithium iron phosphate business, such as Longbai group (002601. SZ), Chuanfa longmang (002312.

SZ), etc.\n\nFrom the perspective of competition pattern, according to the data of Gaogong lithium battery, the market share of lithium ferrite material top5 in 2021 was 64%, down 19 percentage points from 2020 (83%). Among them, the total shipment proportion of top2 was 40%, down only 2 percentage points, and the market share of top3-5 was significantly reduced from 40% to 24%.\n\nCinda Securities believes that with the gradual release of new production capacity of chemical enterprises, the market concentration may continue to show a downward trend.\n\nWhen the shortage of raw materials or delay the surplus time point, cost reduction PK is inevitable\n\nIn fact, behind the large-scale expansion of lithium iron phosphate material capacity, the shortage of raw materials is an indisputable fact.\n\nIn terms of lithium carbonate, according to the latest data released by the customs, the import volume of lithium carbonate in China in the first quarter of 2022 was 27497 tons, a year-on-year increase of 43.7%. Guojin Securities said that at present, the increment of the production end is quite limited, and there is still a shortage in 2022.\n\nIn terms of phosphate rock, since the second half of 2021, Yuntianhua, Wengfu group, kaiphosphorus group and some enterprises in Hubei have stopped selling or significantly reduced the take out volume of phosphate rock. At the same time, they have to purchase some medium and high-grade phosphate rock, resulting in less phosphate rock circulating in the market. At present, many phosphorus chemical enterprises reflect that it is very difficult to purchase phosphate rock.\n\nIn terms of iron phosphate, the expansion cycle is longer, 12-18 months, while the expansion cycle of lithium iron phosphate is 6-8 months. Therefore, the relative capacity of iron phosphate is lower in the short term.\n\n“In 2022, due to the shortage of raw materials, the arrival of overcapacity will be delayed to a certain extent. After 2023, with the gradual easing of the tight supply of lithium carbonate, the problem of overcapacity will be faced at that time. Moreover, this is the overcapacity of the industry, and the profit margin of industry leaders will also be affected.” There are new industry analysts said.\n\nA senior employee in the industry also believes that the problems of overcapacity superimposed on raw materials and cash flow will be gradually exposed. The road behind lithium iron phosphate is very difficult, and many small enterprises will be merged after 2023.\n\nHow will new and old players of lithium iron phosphate deal with the situation of overcapacity at that time?\n\nFirst finance called German nano, Fulin Seiko and other enterprises. As of the press time, no reply has been received.\n\nXingfa group (600141. SH) said that after overcapacity in the future, the impact on the company depends on the cost, market price, product scale and other factors of manufacturing lithium iron phosphate.\n\nThe above-mentioned fund manager of Hushang new energy industry told China first finance and economics that the lithium iron phosphate processing link is surplus, the profit probability will be compressed, and all enterprises may usher in cost reduction PK. Enterprises with integrated layout have certain advantages. At the same time, with the decline of product prices, enterprises will have more or less pressure, followed by the exchange of quantity for price.\n\nIn fact, in order to reduce costs and increase efficiency, cathode material enterprises have expanded upstream and downstream. Taking German nano as an example, the company plans to invest 800 million yuan to build a 200000 ton / year lithium iron phosphate precursor project in Qujing, Yunnan, and cooperate with Ningde times and Yiwei lithium energy in the downstream. It is reported that the Defang Yiwei factory, which the company cooperates with Yiwei lithium energy, is the cathode material project with the largest monomer capacity in China.\n\nHunan Yuneng, Hubei Wanrun and anda technology have also announced the layout of iron phosphate business.\n\nChemical enterprises with cross-border layout are expected to give full play to their own advantages of integration. Such as iron source advantages of Longbai group, anada and other titanium dioxide enterprises; Phosphorus source advantages of phosphorus chemical enterprises such as Xingfa group and Yuntianhua.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the overcapacity of lithium iron phosphate undoubtedly means an opportunity to improve profits for downstream power battery enterprises. Some people in the power battery industry said that if lithium iron phosphate has excess capacity, the cost will drop for battery enterprises. The above fund managers also believe that the overcapacity of lithium iron phosphate will benefit the power battery enterprises.\n\nAccording to the data of China automotive power battery industry innovation alliance, the installed capacity of lithium iron phosphate batteries in China totaled 79.8gwh in 2021, accounting for 51.7%, which exceeded that of ternary batteries. In April 2022, the installed capacity of lithium iron phosphate power battery in China was 18.6gwh, with a year-on-year increase of 200.7%.", "timestamp": 1653250858, "digest": "6i4fg5H-hg0r-nKvFnFjilLmY-NX_ZH2KXDg4lmcf2s", "contributor": "0xcf8666a2CDDd7ea7F3383F98eD9bC946DBf3C482"}

But in order to use them appropriately, we need to fully understand our biological limitations — not just as a vague concept. This graph made it real for us.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1310/0\\*2QTq36S0vUpkR1C9)\n\nAre you pretty sure you want kids but feel like *really* thinking about it is a “later you” problem? Have you heard about IVF or surrogacy and thought, “I should probably actually understand what that entails,” but never followed up? Do you get a little pit in your stomach when someone mentions egg freezing and think, “should I be looking into that?”\n\nIf any of these ring true for you, no worries, we are totally with you. It is completely normal to put off thinking about this stuff when it doesn’t feel particularly relevant or pressing! That said, we focused our [graduate thesis](https://soeithelp.stanford.edu/design-impact) research on enabling women to make informed decisions about their fertility and family planning. In interviewing dozens of women ages 21–40 over the past year, we’ve started to realize that pushing off thinking about this stuff is leading to what we now call “Oh Sh\\*t” moments down the road, when suddenly options for having kids can feel a lot more limited and women ask themselves “when was I supposed to be planning for this?”\n\nAt the same time, women we interviewed who were not yet thinking about children reported feeling like they *should* be and asked us to share back with them what we found. There seems to be a general sense of “I should know more,” but not a lot of guidance on what to learn.\n\nSo, that said, we’re here to share a few things we’ve learned with you throughout our research so that we can all start clarifying our desires and understanding our options before we hit any sort of panic zone around fertility. This is in no way pushing anyone to have children, or to set hard-and-fast timelines, but just to help us all start having realistic conversations with ourselves around how our lives could play out, with a few guiding questions along the way.\n\n## 1: The Disney Princess Complex and Preventing the “Oh Sh\\*t” Moment\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/The-Oh-Sht-Moment-e1ilpti)\n\n## What is the “Disney princess” complex?\n\nWe’ll preface by pointing out that we didn’t come up with this term. It has been a headline before, but different groups have defined it in different ways. Some describe it as causing body image issues and an obsession with looks. Others (mostly male blogs) say it causes unrealistic expectations in dating. What *we* are calling the disney princess complex is the idea that we are socialized to believe once we fall in love, everything will fall into place in our lives and we’ll live happily ever after — a whimsical approach to dating and potential family-building.\n\nOver the past few decades we’ve actually come a pretty long way in moving away from this narrative in how we think about relationships, since it’s obviously becoming more and more normal to be independent and career-focused and not just wait around for a man to save us. And beyond that, it’s way more accepted to be queer, not get married, or have different relationship structures like polyamory or open relationships.\n\nBut while narratives around what it means to be a woman in the world have shifted, our narratives around children have not. We’re still conditioned to believe that if we have a partner who loves us, kids will just work out when the time is right, like we see in fairytales. Or beyond fairytales, what we’ve seen with the generations before us. But as the “right time” for kids gets pushed due to later marriages, career aspirations, and financial constraints, for a lot of people it has become an experience far from a fairytale. The Disney princess influence on family “just working out” does not match our current reality, and provides a pretty unrealistic narrative of what to expect. We are not Disney princesses, nor do we want to be! But until we reconcile the disconnect and start planning within our current reality, “Oh Sh\\*t” moments will continue to happen.\n\n## What is causing these “Oh Sh\\*t” moments and how can we prevent them?\n\n## Need for reproductive assistance\n\nOne [statistic](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/02news/ameriwomen.htm) to note is that the average age at which women had their first child in the US rose from 21.4 years old in 1970 to 26.9 in 2018. For fathers, it’s increased from 27 to 31. Obviously, this still sounds pretty young. I mean, we’re in our mid-twenties, but this age thing feeds into the fact that one in six couples today has trouble conceiving. And, in at least half of all cases of infertility, a [male factor](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17201-male-infertility) is a major or contributing cause. So, often, the “Oh Sh\\*t” moment in a heterosexual relationship could be getting to the point of being ready to have kids and then realizing you’re going to need some assistance if you want to have biological children–for queer couples this could be finding out how much it costs to utilize assisted reproductive technologies (ART) or realizing that you are not covered by insurance.\n\nAuthor’s note: we believe everyone should have access to fertility benefits! And abortion! True agency is the ability to say no and to say yes (check out our website [http://whohateswomen.com](http://whohateswomen.com/) for more on this).\n\n## Shift in life circumstances\n\nAnother reason for the “Oh Sh\\*t” moment comes from life changes; we’ve heard from a lot of women in their 30’s or 40’s who went through breakups or encountered other life changes and suddenly their life circumstances around children were completely different. They’d been assuming things were going to work out when the time was right, and planning for a certain version of their life, but all of a sudden they’re asking themselves questions like, am I willing to have kids on my own? Should I have frozen my eggs years ago? How important are biological children to me?\n\n## Medical diagnoses\n\nAnd finally, “Oh Sh\\*t” moments can come along with medical diagnoses. We have a really long way to go in the world of women’s healthcare to even understand what is going on with our bodies (we could do a whole separate book on that), but we’ve talked to a bunch of women who face an “Oh Sh\\*t” moment when they suddenly become aware of a medical condition, like endometriosis, PCOS, or an autoimmune disease that could affect their fertility and need to make decisions about how to handle that. This can also come about at the moment of transition for transgender folks in deciding how to handle preserving fertility if they’d like to do so.\n\n## What do I do with this information?\n\nRight, so honestly, that’s kind of the whole point of this article! We know this stuff can be super overwhelming, and it’s way easier to just be like “I’ll deal with this later”. But we’ve heard from enough women now who kept moving the goalpost of “I’ll deal with this later,” and ultimately ended up in very stressful scenarios, that we really think there is value in starting to think about this stuff earlier on.\n\nFor a lot of people, this is honestly just getting clear with yourself on some possible scenarios for how your life could play out and thinking through what you might do in that situation. Here are some examples:\n\n“I know I *really* want kids, so if I get to be in my early 30’s and I’m still really not feeling ready, maybe that’s when I get a fertility assessment to see if anything is abnormal that I should be aware of?”\n\n“I’m not sure if I want kids yet, but if I decide to have them it would likely be in my late 30’s or even early 40’s, thus IVF could be necessary. Maybe I could consider freezing my eggs at a younger age in order for that to have a higher chance of success?”\n\n“I’m queer and know I will want to use assited reproductive technologies to have children, but all of that can cost a lot of money. Maybe I could start saving or advocating for fertility benefits in my workplace?”\n\nAgain, none of this is personal or medical advice at all, but we think knowledge is power. If we can get educated on the options out there, understand the realistic costs and limitations that might exist, and reflect on how these options might fit into our own lives, then we have a lot more agency over our futures. We can avoid the “Oh Sh\\*t” moments, not miss out on options because we didn’t know or didn’t understand, and feel convicted in our decisions when it is time to make them.\n\n## 2: The Paradox of Partnership\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/The-Paradox-of-Partnership-e1ilpvg)\n\n## What is the “Paradox of Partnership?”\n\nWhen chatting with dozens of women between the ages of 21 and 40, partnership and lack of partnership are both used as reasons to delay thinking about family planning and fertility. We heard people in partnerships say “I’m not too worried about it, we’ll have these conversations once we get more serious about having kids” and people without partners say “I don’t have a partner so I don’t think about family planning yet.” Sound like you?\n\n## So, when are people planning for children?\n\nIn many cases, right before they start trying! Which, in our parents’ generation, made a bit more sense because marriage and children were essentially the default for everyone and timelines tended to move more quickly. Now, couples are waiting a lot longer not only to marry, but also to have kids. Many factors contribute to this, but according to [a study](https://modernfertility.com/modern-state-fertility-2020-sofi-career-money) by Sofi and Modern Fertility, 60% of respondents reported delaying childbearing due to not having enough money. Life costs more money nowadays, so getting to a place where we can fully provide for children is taking longer than for our parents, and we have pretty abysmal childcare support in this country to help us.\n\nOn top of that, there are higher numbers of women pursuing education and continued education, and more women working and advancing in their careers. Relationships and dating have changed, as well–in some ways it feels like we’re all slight commitment-phobes due to the rise of divorce rates we experienced with our parents’ generation.\n\nSo, all of this combined is pushing out the timeline for having kids. Which in some sense is awesome. It provides more opportunity to pursue other things outside of building a family. The only problem is that our ability to have biological children really does change over time. We can push out the timeline, but if the goalpost keeps moving back and back and back, eventually we could run into a situation where we just don’t have as many options as we did before. Most folks we’ve interviewed have pretty vague ideas of what it might look like to try to have kids at different stages of life given egg counts, fertility challenges, etc.\n\nHence, the need to plan ahead. We believe more forethought could go into what you want, outside of partnership. When you consider divorce rates averaging around 45–50%, the likelihood of raising children on your own or co-parenting from different households is actually quite high. This is not a fun statistic, but it was a reframe that helped us think through the realities of choosing to have children.\n\nWe also heard many stories of women experiencing a breakup at 35, 36, 37 with someone they thought they were going to marry and have kids with. That can’t be planned for, of course, but it’s a very real possibility–partnership is kind of a question mark! Doesn’t it feel a bit odd to hinge such a big decision on a question mark?\n\n## Yes! What do I do with this information?\n\nWe plan out almost everything else in our lives, so it’s interesting that we keep this sort of whimsical outlook of “it will fall into place!” Or “if it’s meant to be it will be” around having kids. We believe this is a conversation that is useful to have with ourselves, outside of partnership, so that we can handle possible changes in our lives with the grounding that we know what we want.\n\nWe’ve laid out some examples of guiding questions to think about with yourself, whether or not you have a partner:\n\n“I don’t have a partner at this moment and I’m like 75% sure I want kids in the future, but definitely not 100%…would I be willing to spend money on getting a fertility assessment or freezing my eggs now so that I can have some extra buffer room to decide?”\n\n“I definitely need to be on the same page about kids as my partner before marriage, but when I brought it up it kind of caught them off-guard. What do I really want kid-wise and what kind of timeline am I thinking about? What will I do if we don’t align?”\n\n“Thinking about future partners — I’d want to ask myself if I would feel confident raising a child with them if we did not stay together romantically in the future?”\n\n“What if I’m not even sure I want the 1:1 partnership model for the rest of my life? Would I consider having kids on my own? Would I want to be a “choice mom” (the new term for having children solo intentionally)?\n\n“Do I want multiple partners or a larger family unit to raise children with as a community?”\n\nNow, this is not to scare anyone or push folks to overplan. These are huge questions, and our answers can change over time. But knowing our options, being real about the various outcomes that could play out, and having a good sense of our own desires–detached from partnership–should set us up to have much more agency than if we put off thinking about children until we want to start trying.\n\n## 3: False Confidence in Options and Fertility Unit Economics\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/False-Optionality-e1ilq0l)\n\n## What is causing “false confidence” in fertility?\n\nWith rapid advancements in fertility technology and heavy investment in the space, it’s easy to believe that we will have plenty of options for conceiving when the time is right. There are some really exciting emerging technologies. However, due to high cost and mixed success rates of fertility interventions, our current options are actually less of a slam dunk than we think, and can lead to emotional and physical challenges.\n\nWe also seem to have a skewed understanding of the accessibility of these fertility interventions, partly from the influence of celebrity news and social media. In 2015, Gabrielle Union opened up about the shame she felt in prioritizing career over family building, leading her to pursue IVF in her 40’s. In 2016, Selena Gomez froze her eggs; her medical care team recommended considering the procedure before undergoing chemotherapy for Lupus. In 2018, Halsey froze her eggs at 23 due to her endometriosis diagnosis and related surgeries. In 2020, we learned more about Kim Kardashian’s fertility journey–during her first two pregnancies she experienced placenta accreta and gestational diabetes, a condition in which the placenta gets stuck inside the body during birth. Because of this, she chose to use surrogates for her third and fourth children. In 2021, we watched Heather Rae from Selling Sunsets document her fertility journey through IVF and embryo preservation on TikTok. And finally, in 2022, we learned Chrissy Teigen is using IVF to try for her third child and saw her share the all-too-common, but often private, pain of miscarriage.\n\nOn the one hand, this exposure is great. It’s passively trojan-horsing some of this fertility information to folks and normalizing conversations. But while exposure is good, it could also be giving us a false sense of security. We hear the ages of some of these celebrities and think “ah, I have all the time in the world.” However, for them, money isn’t an issue. They can afford as many cycles or procedures as it takes, and can seek out and travel to the best clinics in the world.\n\nWe also detected a lot of false confidence when speaking with women who use their mom’s story as an example of success. We heard things like, “well my mom had a kid at 39, so I’m probably good!” However, there are differences between our mothers’ generation and ours. Not only are we, on average, having kids later in life, there’s also more and more [evidence ](https://www.popsci.com/air-pollution-fertility-pregnancy/)that environmental factors like pollution affect fertility, and that fertility is generally on the decline.\n\nFertility struggles also are not limited to women. In fact, it’s a giant misconception and one that we need to set straight. In at least half of all cases of infertility, a male factor is a [major or contributing cause](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17201-male-infertility). While researchers aren’t sure what exactly is causing male-factor infertility–they mostly blame environmental factors–it is clear that male fertility is decreasing. In 1992, a [study](https://www.bmj.com/content/305/6854/609) found a global 50% decline in sperm counts in men over the previous 60 years. Multiple studies over subsequent years confirmed that initial finding, including a 2017 [paper](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/6/646/4035689) showing 50–60% decline in sperm concentration between 1973 and 2011 in men from around the world.\n\nSo what does this mean? We’re not trying to scare the shit out of everyone. But there’s no denying fertility is changing and the need for assisted reproductive technologies is increasing. We need to get real about how much different treatments cost and the likely success rates at different ages (because age matters here too) with assisted reproductive technologies like IUI, egg freezing, and IVF. With this information we can better plan, better save, and better prioritize when making life decisions, like potentially taking fertility benefits into account when job searching.\n\n## How much do fertility options really cost?\n\nTo begin, we need to make clear that most of these procedures are not covered by insurance, public or private. This is something not everyone knows. Unless it is deemed “medically necessary,” like in the case of women undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, it is not covered. And these guidelines are quite strict–we spoke with a woman undergoing chemo for an autoimmune disease who could not get egg freezing covered as “medically necessary” because it wasn’t cancer. This also typically excludes LGBTQ+ individuals who don’t meet the definitions of “infertility” that may qualify them for coverage. Even transgender individuals undergoing gender-affirming care may not meet the criteria for “infertility” that would cover them for fertility preservation (think: egg or sperm freezing).\n\nSo, most patients are paying out of pocket for these treatments, which can end up being well over $10,000, depending on the treatment. Let’s break it down. And shoutout to [FertilityIQ](https://www.fertilityiq.com/) — a super informative fertility education site that helped us source these numbers (this platform also costs money…nothing is free in this fertility world!).\n\n## IUI\n\nIUI, which stands for Intrauterine Insemination, is a procedure to put sperm directly inside the uterus, helping healthy sperm get closer to an egg. It is usually a “first try” for unexplained infertility. You may explore this if you have endometriosis or low sperm count/quality. It would also be used for same-sex female couples using donor sperm, or single women using donor sperm. It averages between $500-$4000 per cycle or “try,” essentially. The range is so wide because it can vary by medication pricing, monitoring and bloodwork, and the insemination procedure, so it mostly depends on the clinic you go to.\n\n## IVF\n\nIVF, which stands for In-Vitro Fertilization, is a procedure in which eggs and sperm are fertilized outside of the body in a test tube or petri dish, and then a viable fertilized embryo is put directly inside the uterus. It can be eggs and sperm from partners, or donor eggs / donor sperm. It is also often used with surrogates. This is often a next step in the unexplained infertility process, or for women who have fallopian tube damage/blockage, or other health concerns. IVF can cost well over $20,000 for one cycle when tallying the cost of treatment and medication–most women will average 2.1 cycles, bringing the total cost upwards of $40,000. Cost also depends on if you do genetic testing or other add-ons and is variable by clinic and by state.\n\n## Egg freezing\n\nEgg freezing is the last one we’ll cover, although there are many more fertility options. Egg freezing is a procedure in which eggs are extracted and then frozen using cryopreservation. It is used as a preservation measure, so that you can use the eggs later. You can freeze embryos (fertilized eggs) for preservation as well. On average, egg freezing patients will spend $30,000-$40,000 on treatment and storage. The breakdown is around $15,000 per cycle (to extract the eggs) and most women do an average of 2.1 cycles. Storage costs depend on location, but average around $500 per year.\n\nIt becomes even more complex when assessing the unit economics of fertility treatments. Freezing your eggs at 32 is a very different financial decision than freezing your eggs at 38, or 43 like Kourtney Kardashian. For example, you might be able to get 40 eggs in one round at age 32 for $20,000 with longer-term storage costs, and 20 eggs in three rounds at age 38 for $60,000 with reduced storage costs. We should be thinking not only about which fertility options might make sense for us, but also when those options make sense in the context of our wants and needs. It’s not fun to have to think about unit economics when thinking about the magic of having a baby! But that is exactly the kind of psychological barrier we hope to help women overcome.\n\n## So, what could I be thinking about?\n\nThere are a few companies popping up to make fertility procedures cheaper, which is exciting. That’s essentially [Kindbody’s](https://kindbody.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=kindbody&utm_term=kindbody&utm_campaign=__Kindbody+Brand&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=5349304425&hsa_cam=15158927904&hsa_grp=132895691881&hsa_ad=558827162131&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-482671827007&hsa_kw=kindbody&hsa_mt=p&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwspKUBhCvARIsAB2IYutVqaW_myuSzBGeZxOcosPqZGy-GuI_1dUAym-32IhnsXPZIIu6lHUaArX5EALw_wcB) premise–they’re improving user experience but also trying to drive down costs. But even at Kindbody, if you want to get a basic fertility assessment to find out where you’re at and if you should be worried, it can still be upwards of $300. In some states, insurance companies are required to cover a fertility assessment, so if you’re interested in getting a fertility workup done, talk to your OBGYN. They should be able to refer you to a clinic, and with that referral your insurance could cover it. But *always* ask upfront what your insurance will cover.\n\nThere are also companies like [Carrot Fertility](https://www.get-carrot.com/) or [Progyny](https://progyny.com/) that facilitate employers offering their employees fertility benefits. You could consider negotiating or advocating for fertility benefits in your current company or next job! And finally, there are companies like [Sunfish](https://joinsunfish.com/) offering financing and loans for fertility treatments.\n\nAdditionally, here are a few guiding questions you could ask yourself:\n\n“How do I feel about assisted reproductive technologies in general?”\n\n“Do I know what, if any, fertility coverage I currently have?”\n\n“If I have a partner(s), have we mutually discussed our feelings about ART? Does my partner have fertility benefits?”\n\n“I’m queer and would likely use ART to have a biological child with my partner, how might we plan for that?”\n\n“If I’m diagnosed with a fertility issue (about 10% of women have PCOS and 2–10% have endometriosis) and struggle to get pregnant naturally, how much money, if any, would I be willing to spend on assisted reproductive technology?”\n\n“Am I willing to start saving money (or advocating for benefits!) now to have a plan in place for if I might need ART?”\n\n## 4: Why We Might Not Want Kids\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/Why-We-Might-Not-Want-Kids-e1ilq28)\n\n## Let’s talk about this!\n\nObviously, it’s becoming increasingly socially acceptable to not want kids, but we don’t actually spend much structured time thinking or talking about the reasons why we do or do not want kids. We found in many cases in our interviews with women, it’s just referred to as a feeling. But where does this feeling come from? Is it subliminal social pressure? What your friends are doing? The next logical step in your relationship with your partner? Or, is it truly your own desire and intentional decision, one way or another?\n\nSo, let’s talk about why we might not want kids! Lack of a supportive partner, lifestyle and identity, climate change, and health concerns are all valid reasons for choosing not to have children and deserve some discussion to spark thoughtful reflection. And, even without children of your own, there are many ways to integrate children into your life if you still want to be around them.\n\n## Lack of supportive partner\n\nUnfortunately, the ever-present influence of traditional gender roles feeds into considerations around lack of a supportive partner. According to [happiness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness) expert Paul Dolan, a professor of behavioral science at the London School of Economics, women who are single with no children are actually the happiest. Dolan [explains](https://www.businessinsider.com/unmarried-childless-women-are-happiest-expert-says-2019-5) that while men derive benefits from [marriage](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/marriage), the same cannot generally be said for women. This statement is clearly very heteronormative and sweeping, and there are many really great marriages out there, but women are still typically the default for emotional and household labor within marriages, which gets exacerbated with children involved. Married heterosexual mothers notoriously take on more responsibilities than their male partners and very different responsibilities than their single women counterparts.\n\n## Lifestyle and identity\n\nHere, we want to touch on the concept of “regretting motherhood” which is super taboo in our society to talk about.\n\nSociologist Orna Donath published a book called [Regretting Motherhood,](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32302223-regretting-motherhood) which is a study on women who self-report regretting becoming mothers. There are many different reasons they became mothers in the first place–avoiding divorce, meeting family expectations, fitting in with friends, or simply because they thought it was the “next step”–and some of them actually did have a strong desire to be mothers before having kids, but all of them ended up regretting it when faced with the reality of motherhood.\n\nWe always hear about women who choose *not* to be mothers being warned that they will regret their decision later in life, but we really don’t talk about the possibility that the opposite could also be true — that a woman who becomes a mother might regret it. This brings us back to women dealing with most of the emotional and household labor in heterosexual relationships–the burden of childbearing often does fall primarily on the woman, which is a very real factor to consider depending on your relationship. Looking at the realities of the lifestyle changes and identity changes that come along with having kids, you might just decide you are not down for that shift and really value your autonomy, which is a completely valid choice.\n\n## Climate change\n\nClimate change is a very real consideration for a lot of folks in the decision of whether or not to have kids. In our parents’ generation, they still had plenty of societal issues going on that could make them wary of bringing children into the world (ex. war, economic stress, etc.), but it wasn’t at quite the same level of climate change–our world is fully on fire and not on track to stabilize.\n\nGiven the trajectory we’re on, there’s definitely questions of: “What kind of world am I bringing my kids into?” “Where should we live so that we’re not at constant threat of floods, fires, famine, etc., and can we even afford that?” For some, this feels more pressing than for others, but certainly we’re hearing more and more about people choosing not to have children due to climate change.\n\nWe are absolutely not trying to be doomsday here, and there’s an argument on the flip-side of all this where having children is actually a sign of sustained hope for the world, but we just want to validate the fact that you might have considered this and that you are not crazy for factoring climate into your decision-making.\n\n## Health concerns\n\nFinally, health concerns are a valid consideration. Maybe you are already dealing with a health condition that meaningfully affects your life and you do not know how a pregnancy or the stress of having children might impact your own personal health. We spoke with a woman who has a very intense autoimmune disease and is worried about taking care of a child while also trying to manage her disease. Obviously, our society should have better resources for and access to childcare, which would solve many of these problems, but within our current reality this is a serious consideration.\n\nEven the act of giving birth can come with serious health risks that are rarely talked about. [303,000](https://everymothercounts.org/our-story/the-issue/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwspKUBhCvARIsAB2IYuucoFuxdQwdJE4OyzDt4eGzFYrpU5MOFsJEDNZWagVR3FhDXp6sFzwaAhVzEALw_wcB) women die around the world as a result of complications of pregnancy and childbirth every year, and due to inequitable care, Black Women in the US have the highest [maternal mortality rate](https://usafacts.org/articles/the-us-maternal-mortality-rate-peaked-during-the-pandemic-and-was-highest-for-black-women/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=ND-Healthcare&gclid=Cj0KCQjwspKUBhCvARIsAB2IYutgrWUncb-QfJGc1JhdkS2mNZQbTxcO2t3O1wry1n1lTQJxH4B1d64aAp-VEALw_wcB), more than two times worse than that of any other racial or ethnic group.\n\nAdditionally, we are not told much about birthing until it happens to us. Even with more and more women opening up about the realities of childbirth on social media, we are still wildly uninformed when it comes to what happens to our bodies during and after childbirth. Even miscarriages are taboo, yet 10–20% of known pregnancies end in them. For some women, this might have a meaningful impact on whether or not they want to be a birthing parent and thus it should not remain a taboo topic.\n\n## What can I be thinking about?\n\nSo, there are a lot of reasons you might not want kids. We have a really strong narrative in society that parenthood will be the best thing that ever happened to you. However, we heard a quote recently that we loved along the lines of, “We are told parenthood will be the best thing that ever happened to you, but if you don’t become a parent or don’t want to,\\* something else \\*will be the best thing that ever happened to you.” You’ll always have a best thing! The best thing is not the same for everyone.\n\nThe status quo and cultural expectation is still to have children, but women are still sacrificing the most with having kids. So we hope that the decision of whether or not to have kids becomes more intentional– one you truly have conviction in. Also, experiencing the positive impacts of “nurturing” something does not have to be children. It could be nurturing your relationships, your community, the world in whatever way feels right to you. Or, if you are really inclined to nurture children, there are a million ways to integrate kids into your life even if they are not your own.\n\nHere are some guiding questions to consider:\n\n“Have I thought about all the ways my lifestyle would change if I were to have kids? Am I okay with that? “\n\n“Do I want kids of my own or just kids in my life in general?”\n\n“Do I feel like I would be taking on the role of primary caregiver in my relationship if we were to have kids, and if so, am I okay with that?”\n\n“Do I feel that bringing a child into the world is something I’m comfortable with given my own personal feelings about the trajectory our world is on?”\n\n“Does having the right partner meaningfully impact whether or not I would want kids?”\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nUltimately, the goal of this article is to help women avoid the “Oh Sh\\*t” moment we keep hearing about, where they get totally blindsided by fertility challenges. And again, you can have babies at any age and in a lot of different ways–we just want everyone to understand the options that are available to them and empower everyone to become their own advocate!\n\n## Please reach out if this brought anything up for you or if you have any questions!", "timestamp": 1653251904, "digest": "_DoeT7tVEMYnXe0R3156V0S9AKYoJb3xdw_cSY4SAVE", "contributor": "0xa0C3a5E5e25dDE1148296d8c3971e17009b45ccF"}

Su kejing, director of the Department of soil ecological environment of the Ministry of ecological environment, said that he would deeply fight the tough battle of agricultural and rural pollution control, give full play to the role of the government, the market and villagers, and speed up the filling of weaknesses. By 2025, the national rural domestic sewage treatment rate will reach 40%.\n\nSu kejing said that in recent years, the Ministry of ecological environment, together with relevant departments, has formulated plans according to local conditions, popularized typical experience and practices, accelerated the establishment of rural domestic sewage treatment system, and achieved preliminary results. “But on the whole, the foundation of rural domestic sewage treatment is weak and the task is still arduous. By 2021, the rural domestic sewage treatment rate is only about 28%.” In this regard, the Ministry of ecology and environment will further fight the tough battle of agricultural and rural pollution control and speed up the filling of weaknesses. By 2025, the national rural domestic sewage treatment rate will reach 40%.\n\nFirst, give play to the leading role of local governments. Strengthen the overall connection, take the county as the unit, comprehensively manage the rural domestic sewage, and organically connect with toilet improvement, urban development, rural construction, land and space planning, etc.\n\nSecond, give play to the main role of the market. Follow the economic law, let the main body, projects, funds and other elements live, and operate in a market-oriented and sustainable manner. Qualified areas can entrust professional institutions to comprehensively implement rural domestic sewage treatment and improve the level of large-scale operation.\n\nThird, give full play to the role of villagers’ participation. Fully respect the farmers’ rights to know, participate and supervise, and enhance their sense of ownership. Give full play to the organization and coordination role of the two village committees, and organize villagers to participate in sewage treatment planning, construction, operation and management through fund-raising and labor raising, so as to get through the “last kilometer”.\n\nMassive information and accurate interpretation are all in Sina Finance app", "timestamp": 1653251846, "digest": "fGzyeK-iKxrKGzeabK_Z9CSYO_-B50wuT04nbBfR7ok", "contributor": "0xFDb3E6aabd9541D7110cc61c7326B3DB531C889a"}

A few days ago, the seminar on “digital twin city framework and global practice” held by the Chinese Academy of information and communications was successfully held. Yu Xiaohui, President of the Chinese Academy of information and communications, pointed out in his speech that digital twin cities are an important direction for the development and evolution of smart cities.\n\nWhen the digital twin and smart city met, the spark of landing application was finally detonated, and the digital twin officially evolved from a technical concept to a new transformation path.\n\nKey points of digital twin smart city construction\n\nWith the rapid development of Internet of things, cloud computing, big data and other information technologies in recent years, the objective technical conditions for building a smart city have matured. The digital twin smart city, as the advanced stage of smart city, is to drive the reconstruction of the city with 5g, AI and other scientific and technological means, digitize, platform and label the urban twin, and reshape urban planning and management from a new perspective of integration.\n\nIn recent years, digital twin cities are accelerating their landing and become an important direction of urban form evolution in the future. On the one hand, “building a digital twin city” has risen to a national height. The outline of China’s 14th five year plan clearly points out that “improve the urban information model platform and operation management service platform, build the urban data resource system, promote the construction of urban data brain” and “explore the construction of digital twin city”, which has created a good development environment for urban digital twin. On the other hand, at present, digital twin technology has been applied to urban architecture, transportation infrastructure and other building types, digital twin base construction of different scale levels, and has created a variety of application scenarios such as digital twin Industrial Park, digital twin ecological park and digital twin park.\n\n“Green code link, face capture, AI recognition…” the “5g + Digital twin smart community” project, which promotes the modernization of grass-roots governance system and governance capacity with 5g, big data, cloud computing, Internet of things, artificial intelligence and other technologies, has been implemented in Shuangliu District, Chengdu. This is a vivid practice for China Telecom to give full play to digitization to help the government’s digital transformation.\n\nIn fact, this is only an epitome of the digital twin field of operators. In the 5g era, digital twin technology and application have been promoted to a strategic level. As the main force of digital economy construction, operators are constantly building leading examples in the field of digital twin. For example, China Telecom’s “5g + MEC” smart business cloud XR digital twin platform has been implemented in more than 100 cities across the country; The first city level IOT platform built by China Telecom in xiong’an has become the base of realizing digital twin city in xiong’an new area; China Mobile released the 2030 + vision and needs report, which proposed the 6G vision of “digital twins and ubiquitous wisdom”, the “six characteristics” of 6G network and the “three layers and four sides” 6G network logical architecture; China Unicom led the relevant work of the urban safety laboratory in xiong’an new area and carried out the exploration of new strategies, new technologies and new theories of digital twin urban safety.\n\nPromoting co construction and sharing is the only way\n\nThe value of digital twin is mainly realized through digital top-level design and digital operation. Therefore, we should pay more attention to building the infrastructure system of smart city. 5g is an important foundation to support the virtual real interaction of digital twins. As the main force of digital economy construction, operators should first provide excellent cases of building various leading digital operation systems for the shared and co constructed network under 5g new infrastructure, promote the popularization of applications, publicize the application achievements of digital twins, strengthen the real-world display of digital twins, and encourage the industrial Internet Innovation Exhibition Center to integrate digital twins solutions.\n\nIn addition, at present, most of the key technologies related to digital twins are in the hands of foreign enterprises, such as sensor technology, CAD technology, CAE technology, PLM technology, VR / AR technology, etc. Therefore, operators should pool the forces of politics, industry, University and research, speed up the formulation of the overall architecture of digital twins, strengthen the top-level design, actively participate in the formulation of the reference architecture of digital twins, and seize the right to formulate international standards of digital twins.", "timestamp": 1653251961, "digest": "b6gdjoIv0H1_eRZLZAefhRA17yC1v6UwXhdGVmGLoUI", "contributor": "0x72a04836aFD242c755cDB39E149D0f267a31f80e"}

But in order to use them appropriately, we need to fully understand our biological limitations — not just as a vague concept. This graph made it real for us.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1310/0\\*2QTq36S0vUpkR1C9)\n\nAre you pretty sure you want kids but feel like *really* thinking about it is a “later you” problem? Have you heard about IVF or surrogacy and thought, “I should probably actually understand what that entails,” but never followed up? Do you get a little pit in your stomach when someone mentions egg freezing and think, “should I be looking into that?”\n\nIf any of these ring true for you, no worries, we are totally with you. It is completely normal to put off thinking about this stuff when it doesn’t feel particularly relevant or pressing! That said, we focused our [graduate thesis](https://soeithelp.stanford.edu/design-impact) research on enabling women to make informed decisions about their fertility and family planning. In interviewing dozens of women ages 21–40 over the past year, we’ve started to realize that pushing off thinking about this stuff is leading to what we now call “Oh Sh\\*t” moments down the road, when suddenly options for having kids can feel a lot more limited and women ask themselves “when was I supposed to be planning for this?”\n\nAt the same time, women we interviewed who were not yet thinking about children reported feeling like they *should* be and asked us to share back with them what we found. There seems to be a general sense of “I should know more,” but not a lot of guidance on what to learn.\n\nSo, that said, we’re here to share a few things we’ve learned with you throughout our research so that we can all start clarifying our desires and understanding our options before we hit any sort of panic zone around fertility. This is in no way pushing anyone to have children, or to set hard-and-fast timelines, but just to help us all start having realistic conversations with ourselves around how our lives could play out, with a few guiding questions along the way.\n\n## 1: The Disney Princess Complex and Preventing the “Oh Sh\\*t” Moment\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/The-Oh-Sht-Moment-e1ilpti)\n\n## What is the “Disney princess” complex?\n\nWe’ll preface by pointing out that we didn’t come up with this term. It has been a headline before, but different groups have defined it in different ways. Some describe it as causing body image issues and an obsession with looks. Others (mostly male blogs) say it causes unrealistic expectations in dating. What *we* are calling the disney princess complex is the idea that we are socialized to believe once we fall in love, everything will fall into place in our lives and we’ll live happily ever after — a whimsical approach to dating and potential family-building.\n\nOver the past few decades we’ve actually come a pretty long way in moving away from this narrative in how we think about relationships, since it’s obviously becoming more and more normal to be independent and career-focused and not just wait around for a man to save us. And beyond that, it’s way more accepted to be queer, not get married, or have different relationship structures like polyamory or open relationships.\n\nBut while narratives around what it means to be a woman in the world have shifted, our narratives around children have not. We’re still conditioned to believe that if we have a partner who loves us, kids will just work out when the time is right, like we see in fairytales. Or beyond fairytales, what we’ve seen with the generations before us. But as the “right time” for kids gets pushed due to later marriages, career aspirations, and financial constraints, for a lot of people it has become an experience far from a fairytale. The Disney princess influence on family “just working out” does not match our current reality, and provides a pretty unrealistic narrative of what to expect. We are not Disney princesses, nor do we want to be! But until we reconcile the disconnect and start planning within our current reality, “Oh Sh\\*t” moments will continue to happen.\n\n## What is causing these “Oh Sh\\*t” moments and how can we prevent them?\n\n## Need for reproductive assistance\n\nOne [statistic](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/02news/ameriwomen.htm) to note is that the average age at which women had their first child in the US rose from 21.4 years old in 1970 to 26.9 in 2018. For fathers, it’s increased from 27 to 31. Obviously, this still sounds pretty young. I mean, we’re in our mid-twenties, but this age thing feeds into the fact that one in six couples today has trouble conceiving. And, in at least half of all cases of infertility, a [male factor](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17201-male-infertility) is a major or contributing cause. So, often, the “Oh Sh\\*t” moment in a heterosexual relationship could be getting to the point of being ready to have kids and then realizing you’re going to need some assistance if you want to have biological children–for queer couples this could be finding out how much it costs to utilize assisted reproductive technologies (ART) or realizing that you are not covered by insurance.\n\nAuthor’s note: we believe everyone should have access to fertility benefits! And abortion! True agency is the ability to say no and to say yes (check out our website [http://whohateswomen.com](http://whohateswomen.com/) for more on this).\n\n## Shift in life circumstances\n\nAnother reason for the “Oh Sh\\*t” moment comes from life changes; we’ve heard from a lot of women in their 30’s or 40’s who went through breakups or encountered other life changes and suddenly their life circumstances around children were completely different. They’d been assuming things were going to work out when the time was right, and planning for a certain version of their life, but all of a sudden they’re asking themselves questions like, am I willing to have kids on my own? Should I have frozen my eggs years ago? How important are biological children to me?\n\n## Medical diagnoses\n\nAnd finally, “Oh Sh\\*t” moments can come along with medical diagnoses. We have a really long way to go in the world of women’s healthcare to even understand what is going on with our bodies (we could do a whole separate book on that), but we’ve talked to a bunch of women who face an “Oh Sh\\*t” moment when they suddenly become aware of a medical condition, like endometriosis, PCOS, or an autoimmune disease that could affect their fertility and need to make decisions about how to handle that. This can also come about at the moment of transition for transgender folks in deciding how to handle preserving fertility if they’d like to do so.\n\n## What do I do with this information?\n\nRight, so honestly, that’s kind of the whole point of this article! We know this stuff can be super overwhelming, and it’s way easier to just be like “I’ll deal with this later”. But we’ve heard from enough women now who kept moving the goalpost of “I’ll deal with this later,” and ultimately ended up in very stressful scenarios, that we really think there is value in starting to think about this stuff earlier on.\n\nFor a lot of people, this is honestly just getting clear with yourself on some possible scenarios for how your life could play out and thinking through what you might do in that situation. Here are some examples:\n\n“I know I *really* want kids, so if I get to be in my early 30’s and I’m still really not feeling ready, maybe that’s when I get a fertility assessment to see if anything is abnormal that I should be aware of?”\n\n“I’m not sure if I want kids yet, but if I decide to have them it would likely be in my late 30’s or even early 40’s, thus IVF could be necessary. Maybe I could consider freezing my eggs at a younger age in order for that to have a higher chance of success?”\n\n“I’m queer and know I will want to use assited reproductive technologies to have children, but all of that can cost a lot of money. Maybe I could start saving or advocating for fertility benefits in my workplace?”\n\nAgain, none of this is personal or medical advice at all, but we think knowledge is power. If we can get educated on the options out there, understand the realistic costs and limitations that might exist, and reflect on how these options might fit into our own lives, then we have a lot more agency over our futures. We can avoid the “Oh Sh\\*t” moments, not miss out on options because we didn’t know or didn’t understand, and feel convicted in our decisions when it is time to make them.\n\n## 2: The Paradox of Partnership\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/The-Paradox-of-Partnership-e1ilpvg)\n\n## What is the “Paradox of Partnership?”\n\nWhen chatting with dozens of women between the ages of 21 and 40, partnership and lack of partnership are both used as reasons to delay thinking about family planning and fertility. We heard people in partnerships say “I’m not too worried about it, we’ll have these conversations once we get more serious about having kids” and people without partners say “I don’t have a partner so I don’t think about family planning yet.” Sound like you?\n\n## So, when are people planning for children?\n\nIn many cases, right before they start trying! Which, in our parents’ generation, made a bit more sense because marriage and children were essentially the default for everyone and timelines tended to move more quickly. Now, couples are waiting a lot longer not only to marry, but also to have kids. Many factors contribute to this, but according to [a study](https://modernfertility.com/modern-state-fertility-2020-sofi-career-money) by Sofi and Modern Fertility, 60% of respondents reported delaying childbearing due to not having enough money. Life costs more money nowadays, so getting to a place where we can fully provide for children is taking longer than for our parents, and we have pretty abysmal childcare support in this country to help us.\n\nOn top of that, there are higher numbers of women pursuing education and continued education, and more women working and advancing in their careers. Relationships and dating have changed, as well–in some ways it feels like we’re all slight commitment-phobes due to the rise of divorce rates we experienced with our parents’ generation.\n\nSo, all of this combined is pushing out the timeline for having kids. Which in some sense is awesome. It provides more opportunity to pursue other things outside of building a family. The only problem is that our ability to have biological children really does change over time. We can push out the timeline, but if the goalpost keeps moving back and back and back, eventually we could run into a situation where we just don’t have as many options as we did before. Most folks we’ve interviewed have pretty vague ideas of what it might look like to try to have kids at different stages of life given egg counts, fertility challenges, etc.\n\nHence, the need to plan ahead. We believe more forethought could go into what you want, outside of partnership. When you consider divorce rates averaging around 45–50%, the likelihood of raising children on your own or co-parenting from different households is actually quite high. This is not a fun statistic, but it was a reframe that helped us think through the realities of choosing to have children.\n\nWe also heard many stories of women experiencing a breakup at 35, 36, 37 with someone they thought they were going to marry and have kids with. That can’t be planned for, of course, but it’s a very real possibility–partnership is kind of a question mark! Doesn’t it feel a bit odd to hinge such a big decision on a question mark?\n\n## Yes! What do I do with this information?\n\nWe plan out almost everything else in our lives, so it’s interesting that we keep this sort of whimsical outlook of “it will fall into place!” Or “if it’s meant to be it will be” around having kids. We believe this is a conversation that is useful to have with ourselves, outside of partnership, so that we can handle possible changes in our lives with the grounding that we know what we want.\n\nWe’ve laid out some examples of guiding questions to think about with yourself, whether or not you have a partner:\n\n“I don’t have a partner at this moment and I’m like 75% sure I want kids in the future, but definitely not 100%…would I be willing to spend money on getting a fertility assessment or freezing my eggs now so that I can have some extra buffer room to decide?”\n\n“I definitely need to be on the same page about kids as my partner before marriage, but when I brought it up it kind of caught them off-guard. What do I really want kid-wise and what kind of timeline am I thinking about? What will I do if we don’t align?”\n\n“Thinking about future partners — I’d want to ask myself if I would feel confident raising a child with them if we did not stay together romantically in the future?”\n\n“What if I’m not even sure I want the 1:1 partnership model for the rest of my life? Would I consider having kids on my own? Would I want to be a “choice mom” (the new term for having children solo intentionally)?\n\n“Do I want multiple partners or a larger family unit to raise children with as a community?”\n\nNow, this is not to scare anyone or push folks to overplan. These are huge questions, and our answers can change over time. But knowing our options, being real about the various outcomes that could play out, and having a good sense of our own desires–detached from partnership–should set us up to have much more agency than if we put off thinking about children until we want to start trying.\n\n## 3: False Confidence in Options and Fertility Unit Economics\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/False-Optionality-e1ilq0l)\n\n## What is causing “false confidence” in fertility?\n\nWith rapid advancements in fertility technology and heavy investment in the space, it’s easy to believe that we will have plenty of options for conceiving when the time is right. There are some really exciting emerging technologies. However, due to high cost and mixed success rates of fertility interventions, our current options are actually less of a slam dunk than we think, and can lead to emotional and physical challenges.\n\nWe also seem to have a skewed understanding of the accessibility of these fertility interventions, partly from the influence of celebrity news and social media. In 2015, Gabrielle Union opened up about the shame she felt in prioritizing career over family building, leading her to pursue IVF in her 40’s. In 2016, Selena Gomez froze her eggs; her medical care team recommended considering the procedure before undergoing chemotherapy for Lupus. In 2018, Halsey froze her eggs at 23 due to her endometriosis diagnosis and related surgeries. In 2020, we learned more about Kim Kardashian’s fertility journey–during her first two pregnancies she experienced placenta accreta and gestational diabetes, a condition in which the placenta gets stuck inside the body during birth. Because of this, she chose to use surrogates for her third and fourth children. In 2021, we watched Heather Rae from Selling Sunsets document her fertility journey through IVF and embryo preservation on TikTok. And finally, in 2022, we learned Chrissy Teigen is using IVF to try for her third child and saw her share the all-too-common, but often private, pain of miscarriage.\n\nOn the one hand, this exposure is great. It’s passively trojan-horsing some of this fertility information to folks and normalizing conversations. But while exposure is good, it could also be giving us a false sense of security. We hear the ages of some of these celebrities and think “ah, I have all the time in the world.” However, for them, money isn’t an issue. They can afford as many cycles or procedures as it takes, and can seek out and travel to the best clinics in the world.\n\nWe also detected a lot of false confidence when speaking with women who use their mom’s story as an example of success. We heard things like, “well my mom had a kid at 39, so I’m probably good!” However, there are differences between our mothers’ generation and ours. Not only are we, on average, having kids later in life, there’s also more and more [evidence ](https://www.popsci.com/air-pollution-fertility-pregnancy/)that environmental factors like pollution affect fertility, and that fertility is generally on the decline.\n\nFertility struggles also are not limited to women. In fact, it’s a giant misconception and one that we need to set straight. In at least half of all cases of infertility, a male factor is a [major or contributing cause](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17201-male-infertility). While researchers aren’t sure what exactly is causing male-factor infertility–they mostly blame environmental factors–it is clear that male fertility is decreasing. In 1992, a [study](https://www.bmj.com/content/305/6854/609) found a global 50% decline in sperm counts in men over the previous 60 years. Multiple studies over subsequent years confirmed that initial finding, including a 2017 [paper](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/6/646/4035689) showing 50–60% decline in sperm concentration between 1973 and 2011 in men from around the world.\n\nSo what does this mean? We’re not trying to scare the shit out of everyone. But there’s no denying fertility is changing and the need for assisted reproductive technologies is increasing. We need to get real about how much different treatments cost and the likely success rates at different ages (because age matters here too) with assisted reproductive technologies like IUI, egg freezing, and IVF. With this information we can better plan, better save, and better prioritize when making life decisions, like potentially taking fertility benefits into account when job searching.\n\n## How much do fertility options really cost?\n\nTo begin, we need to make clear that most of these procedures are not covered by insurance, public or private. This is something not everyone knows. Unless it is deemed “medically necessary,” like in the case of women undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, it is not covered. And these guidelines are quite strict–we spoke with a woman undergoing chemo for an autoimmune disease who could not get egg freezing covered as “medically necessary” because it wasn’t cancer. This also typically excludes LGBTQ+ individuals who don’t meet the definitions of “infertility” that may qualify them for coverage. Even transgender individuals undergoing gender-affirming care may not meet the criteria for “infertility” that would cover them for fertility preservation (think: egg or sperm freezing).\n\nSo, most patients are paying out of pocket for these treatments, which can end up being well over $10,000, depending on the treatment. Let’s break it down. And shoutout to [FertilityIQ](https://www.fertilityiq.com/) — a super informative fertility education site that helped us source these numbers (this platform also costs money…nothing is free in this fertility world!).\n\n## IUI\n\nIUI, which stands for Intrauterine Insemination, is a procedure to put sperm directly inside the uterus, helping healthy sperm get closer to an egg. It is usually a “first try” for unexplained infertility. You may explore this if you have endometriosis or low sperm count/quality. It would also be used for same-sex female couples using donor sperm, or single women using donor sperm. It averages between $500-$4000 per cycle or “try,” essentially. The range is so wide because it can vary by medication pricing, monitoring and bloodwork, and the insemination procedure, so it mostly depends on the clinic you go to.\n\n## IVF\n\nIVF, which stands for In-Vitro Fertilization, is a procedure in which eggs and sperm are fertilized outside of the body in a test tube or petri dish, and then a viable fertilized embryo is put directly inside the uterus. It can be eggs and sperm from partners, or donor eggs / donor sperm. It is also often used with surrogates. This is often a next step in the unexplained infertility process, or for women who have fallopian tube damage/blockage, or other health concerns. IVF can cost well over $20,000 for one cycle when tallying the cost of treatment and medication–most women will average 2.1 cycles, bringing the total cost upwards of $40,000. Cost also depends on if you do genetic testing or other add-ons and is variable by clinic and by state.\n\n## Egg freezing\n\nEgg freezing is the last one we’ll cover, although there are many more fertility options. Egg freezing is a procedure in which eggs are extracted and then frozen using cryopreservation. It is used as a preservation measure, so that you can use the eggs later. You can freeze embryos (fertilized eggs) for preservation as well. On average, egg freezing patients will spend $30,000-$40,000 on treatment and storage. The breakdown is around $15,000 per cycle (to extract the eggs) and most women do an average of 2.1 cycles. Storage costs depend on location, but average around $500 per year.\n\nIt becomes even more complex when assessing the unit economics of fertility treatments. Freezing your eggs at 32 is a very different financial decision than freezing your eggs at 38, or 43 like Kourtney Kardashian. For example, you might be able to get 40 eggs in one round at age 32 for $20,000 with longer-term storage costs, and 20 eggs in three rounds at age 38 for $60,000 with reduced storage costs. We should be thinking not only about which fertility options might make sense for us, but also when those options make sense in the context of our wants and needs. It’s not fun to have to think about unit economics when thinking about the magic of having a baby! But that is exactly the kind of psychological barrier we hope to help women overcome.\n\n## So, what could I be thinking about?\n\nThere are a few companies popping up to make fertility procedures cheaper, which is exciting. That’s essentially [Kindbody’s](https://kindbody.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=kindbody&utm_term=kindbody&utm_campaign=__Kindbody+Brand&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=5349304425&hsa_cam=15158927904&hsa_grp=132895691881&hsa_ad=558827162131&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-482671827007&hsa_kw=kindbody&hsa_mt=p&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwspKUBhCvARIsAB2IYutVqaW_myuSzBGeZxOcosPqZGy-GuI_1dUAym-32IhnsXPZIIu6lHUaArX5EALw_wcB) premise–they’re improving user experience but also trying to drive down costs. But even at Kindbody, if you want to get a basic fertility assessment to find out where you’re at and if you should be worried, it can still be upwards of $300. In some states, insurance companies are required to cover a fertility assessment, so if you’re interested in getting a fertility workup done, talk to your OBGYN. They should be able to refer you to a clinic, and with that referral your insurance could cover it. But *always* ask upfront what your insurance will cover.\n\nThere are also companies like [Carrot Fertility](https://www.get-carrot.com/) or [Progyny](https://progyny.com/) that facilitate employers offering their employees fertility benefits. You could consider negotiating or advocating for fertility benefits in your current company or next job! And finally, there are companies like [Sunfish](https://joinsunfish.com/) offering financing and loans for fertility treatments.\n\nAdditionally, here are a few guiding questions you could ask yourself:\n\n“How do I feel about assisted reproductive technologies in general?”\n\n“Do I know what, if any, fertility coverage I currently have?”\n\n“If I have a partner(s), have we mutually discussed our feelings about ART? Does my partner have fertility benefits?”\n\n“I’m queer and would likely use ART to have a biological child with my partner, how might we plan for that?”\n\n“If I’m diagnosed with a fertility issue (about 10% of women have PCOS and 2–10% have endometriosis) and struggle to get pregnant naturally, how much money, if any, would I be willing to spend on assisted reproductive technology?”\n\n“Am I willing to start saving money (or advocating for benefits!) now to have a plan in place for if I might need ART?”\n\n## 4: Why We Might Not Want Kids\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/Why-We-Might-Not-Want-Kids-e1ilq28)\n\n## Let’s talk about this!\n\nObviously, it’s becoming increasingly socially acceptable to not want kids, but we don’t actually spend much structured time thinking or talking about the reasons why we do or do not want kids. We found in many cases in our interviews with women, it’s just referred to as a feeling. But where does this feeling come from? Is it subliminal social pressure? What your friends are doing? The next logical step in your relationship with your partner? Or, is it truly your own desire and intentional decision, one way or another?\n\nSo, let’s talk about why we might not want kids! Lack of a supportive partner, lifestyle and identity, climate change, and health concerns are all valid reasons for choosing not to have children and deserve some discussion to spark thoughtful reflection. And, even without children of your own, there are many ways to integrate children into your life if you still want to be around them.\n\n## Lack of supportive partner\n\nUnfortunately, the ever-present influence of traditional gender roles feeds into considerations around lack of a supportive partner. According to [happiness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness) expert Paul Dolan, a professor of behavioral science at the London School of Economics, women who are single with no children are actually the happiest. Dolan [explains](https://www.businessinsider.com/unmarried-childless-women-are-happiest-expert-says-2019-5) that while men derive benefits from [marriage](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/marriage), the same cannot generally be said for women. This statement is clearly very heteronormative and sweeping, and there are many really great marriages out there, but women are still typically the default for emotional and household labor within marriages, which gets exacerbated with children involved. Married heterosexual mothers notoriously take on more responsibilities than their male partners and very different responsibilities than their single women counterparts.\n\n## Lifestyle and identity\n\nHere, we want to touch on the concept of “regretting motherhood” which is super taboo in our society to talk about.\n\nSociologist Orna Donath published a book called [Regretting Motherhood,](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32302223-regretting-motherhood) which is a study on women who self-report regretting becoming mothers. There are many different reasons they became mothers in the first place–avoiding divorce, meeting family expectations, fitting in with friends, or simply because they thought it was the “next step”–and some of them actually did have a strong desire to be mothers before having kids, but all of them ended up regretting it when faced with the reality of motherhood.\n\nWe always hear about women who choose *not* to be mothers being warned that they will regret their decision later in life, but we really don’t talk about the possibility that the opposite could also be true — that a woman who becomes a mother might regret it. This brings us back to women dealing with most of the emotional and household labor in heterosexual relationships–the burden of childbearing often does fall primarily on the woman, which is a very real factor to consider depending on your relationship. Looking at the realities of the lifestyle changes and identity changes that come along with having kids, you might just decide you are not down for that shift and really value your autonomy, which is a completely valid choice.\n\n## Climate change\n\nClimate change is a very real consideration for a lot of folks in the decision of whether or not to have kids. In our parents’ generation, they still had plenty of societal issues going on that could make them wary of bringing children into the world (ex. war, economic stress, etc.), but it wasn’t at quite the same level of climate change–our world is fully on fire and not on track to stabilize.\n\nGiven the trajectory we’re on, there’s definitely questions of: “What kind of world am I bringing my kids into?” “Where should we live so that we’re not at constant threat of floods, fires, famine, etc., and can we even afford that?” For some, this feels more pressing than for others, but certainly we’re hearing more and more about people choosing not to have children due to climate change.\n\nWe are absolutely not trying to be doomsday here, and there’s an argument on the flip-side of all this where having children is actually a sign of sustained hope for the world, but we just want to validate the fact that you might have considered this and that you are not crazy for factoring climate into your decision-making.\n\n## Health concerns\n\nFinally, health concerns are a valid consideration. Maybe you are already dealing with a health condition that meaningfully affects your life and you do not know how a pregnancy or the stress of having children might impact your own personal health. We spoke with a woman who has a very intense autoimmune disease and is worried about taking care of a child while also trying to manage her disease. Obviously, our society should have better resources for and access to childcare, which would solve many of these problems, but within our current reality this is a serious consideration.\n\nEven the act of giving birth can come with serious health risks that are rarely talked about. [303,000](https://everymothercounts.org/our-story/the-issue/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwspKUBhCvARIsAB2IYuucoFuxdQwdJE4OyzDt4eGzFYrpU5MOFsJEDNZWagVR3FhDXp6sFzwaAhVzEALw_wcB) women die around the world as a result of complications of pregnancy and childbirth every year, and due to inequitable care, Black Women in the US have the highest [maternal mortality rate](https://usafacts.org/articles/the-us-maternal-mortality-rate-peaked-during-the-pandemic-and-was-highest-for-black-women/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=ND-Healthcare&gclid=Cj0KCQjwspKUBhCvARIsAB2IYutgrWUncb-QfJGc1JhdkS2mNZQbTxcO2t3O1wry1n1lTQJxH4B1d64aAp-VEALw_wcB), more than two times worse than that of any other racial or ethnic group.\n\nAdditionally, we are not told much about birthing until it happens to us. Even with more and more women opening up about the realities of childbirth on social media, we are still wildly uninformed when it comes to what happens to our bodies during and after childbirth. Even miscarriages are taboo, yet 10–20% of known pregnancies end in them. For some women, this might have a meaningful impact on whether or not they want to be a birthing parent and thus it should not remain a taboo topic.\n\n## What can I be thinking about?\n\nSo, there are a lot of reasons you might not want kids. We have a really strong narrative in society that parenthood will be the best thing that ever happened to you. However, we heard a quote recently that we loved along the lines of, “We are told parenthood will be the best thing that ever happened to you, but if you don’t become a parent or don’t want to,\\* something else \\*will be the best thing that ever happened to you.” You’ll always have a best thing! The best thing is not the same for everyone.\n\nThe status quo and cultural expectation is still to have children, but women are still sacrificing the most with having kids. So we hope that the decision of whether or not to have kids becomes more intentional– one you truly have conviction in. Also, experiencing the positive impacts of “nurturing” something does not have to be children. It could be nurturing your relationships, your community, the world in whatever way feels right to you. Or, if you are really inclined to nurture children, there are a million ways to integrate kids into your life even if they are not your own.\n\nHere are some guiding questions to consider:\n\n“Have I thought about all the ways my lifestyle would change if I were to have kids? Am I okay with that? “\n\n“Do I want kids of my own or just kids in my life in general?”\n\n“Do I feel like I would be taking on the role of primary caregiver in my relationship if we were to have kids, and if so, am I okay with that?”\n\n“Do I feel that bringing a child into the world is something I’m comfortable with given my own personal feelings about the trajectory our world is on?”\n\n“Does having the right partner meaningfully impact whether or not I would want kids?”\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nUltimately, the goal of this article is to help women avoid the “Oh Sh\\*t” moment we keep hearing about, where they get totally blindsided by fertility challenges. And again, you can have babies at any age and in a lot of different ways–we just want everyone to understand the options that are available to them and empower everyone to become their own advocate!\n\n## Please reach out if this brought anything up for you or if you have any questions!", "timestamp": 1653251852, "digest": "_DoeT7tVEMYnXe0R3156V0S9AKYoJb3xdw_cSY4SAVE", "contributor": "0xa0C3a5E5e25dDE1148296d8c3971e17009b45ccF"}

Have you heard about IVF or surrogacy and thought, “I should probably actually understand what that entails,” but never followed up? Do you get a little pit in your stomach when someone mentions egg freezing and think, “should I be looking into that?”\n\nIf any of these ring true for you, no worries, we are totally with you. It is completely normal to put off thinking about this stuff when it doesn’t feel particularly relevant or pressing! That said, we focused our [graduate thesis](https://soeithelp.stanford.edu/design-impact) research on enabling women to make informed decisions about their fertility and family planning. In interviewing dozens of women ages 21–40 over the past year, we’ve started to realize that pushing off thinking about this stuff is leading to what we now call “Oh Sh\\*t” moments down the road, when suddenly options for having kids can feel a lot more limited and women ask themselves “when was I supposed to be planning for this?”\n\nAt the same time, women we interviewed who were not yet thinking about children reported feeling like they *should* be and asked us to share back with them what we found. There seems to be a general sense of “I should know more,” but not a lot of guidance on what to learn.\n\nSo, that said, we’re here to share a few things we’ve learned with you throughout our research so that we can all start clarifying our desires and understanding our options before we hit any sort of panic zone around fertility. This is in no way pushing anyone to have children, or to set hard-and-fast timelines, but just to help us all start having realistic conversations with ourselves around how our lives could play out, with a few guiding questions along the way.\n\n## 1: The Disney Princess Complex and Preventing the “Oh Sh\\*t” Moment\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/The-Oh-Sht-Moment-e1ilpti)\n\n## What is the “Disney princess” complex?\n\nWe’ll preface by pointing out that we didn’t come up with this term. It has been a headline before, but different groups have defined it in different ways. Some describe it as causing body image issues and an obsession with looks. Others (mostly male blogs) say it causes unrealistic expectations in dating. What *we* are calling the disney princess complex is the idea that we are socialized to believe once we fall in love, everything will fall into place in our lives and we’ll live happily ever after — a whimsical approach to dating and potential family-building.\n\nOver the past few decades we’ve actually come a pretty long way in moving away from this narrative in how we think about relationships, since it’s obviously becoming more and more normal to be independent and career-focused and not just wait around for a man to save us. And beyond that, it’s way more accepted to be queer, not get married, or have different relationship structures like polyamory or open relationships.\n\nBut while narratives around what it means to be a woman in the world have shifted, our narratives around children have not. We’re still conditioned to believe that if we have a partner who loves us, kids will just work out when the time is right, like we see in fairytales. Or beyond fairytales, what we’ve seen with the generations before us. But as the “right time” for kids gets pushed due to later marriages, career aspirations, and financial constraints, for a lot of people it has become an experience far from a fairytale. The Disney princess influence on family “just working out” does not match our current reality, and provides a pretty unrealistic narrative of what to expect. We are not Disney princesses, nor do we want to be! But until we reconcile the disconnect and start planning within our current reality, “Oh Sh\\*t” moments will continue to happen.\n\n## What is causing these “Oh Sh\\*t” moments and how can we prevent them?\n\n## Need for reproductive assistance\n\nOne [statistic](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/02news/ameriwomen.htm) to note is that the average age at which women had their first child in the US rose from 21.4 years old in 1970 to 26.9 in 2018. For fathers, it’s increased from 27 to 31. Obviously, this still sounds pretty young. I mean, we’re in our mid-twenties, but this age thing feeds into the fact that one in six couples today has trouble conceiving. And, in at least half of all cases of infertility, a [male factor](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17201-male-infertility) is a major or contributing cause. So, often, the “Oh Sh\\*t” moment in a heterosexual relationship could be getting to the point of being ready to have kids and then realizing you’re going to need some assistance if you want to have biological children–for queer couples this could be finding out how much it costs to utilize assisted reproductive technologies (ART) or realizing that you are not covered by insurance.\n\nAuthor’s note: we believe everyone should have access to fertility benefits! And abortion! True agency is the ability to say no and to say yes (check out our website [http://whohateswomen.com](http://whohateswomen.com/) for more on this).\n\n## Shift in life circumstances\n\nAnother reason for the “Oh Sh\\*t” moment comes from life changes; we’ve heard from a lot of women in their 30’s or 40’s who went through breakups or encountered other life changes and suddenly their life circumstances around children were completely different. They’d been assuming things were going to work out when the time was right, and planning for a certain version of their life, but all of a sudden they’re asking themselves questions like, am I willing to have kids on my own? Should I have frozen my eggs years ago? How important are biological children to me?\n\n## Medical diagnoses\n\nAnd finally, “Oh Sh\\*t” moments can come along with medical diagnoses. We have a really long way to go in the world of women’s healthcare to even understand what is going on with our bodies (we could do a whole separate book on that), but we’ve talked to a bunch of women who face an “Oh Sh\\*t” moment when they suddenly become aware of a medical condition, like endometriosis, PCOS, or an autoimmune disease that could affect their fertility and need to make decisions about how to handle that. This can also come about at the moment of transition for transgender folks in deciding how to handle preserving fertility if they’d like to do so.\n\n## What do I do with this information?\n\nRight, so honestly, that’s kind of the whole point of this article! We know this stuff can be super overwhelming, and it’s way easier to just be like “I’ll deal with this later”. But we’ve heard from enough women now who kept moving the goalpost of “I’ll deal with this later,” and ultimately ended up in very stressful scenarios, that we really think there is value in starting to think about this stuff earlier on.\n\nFor a lot of people, this is honestly just getting clear with yourself on some possible scenarios for how your life could play out and thinking through what you might do in that situation. Here are some examples:\n\n“I know I *really* want kids, so if I get to be in my early 30’s and I’m still really not feeling ready, maybe that’s when I get a fertility assessment to see if anything is abnormal that I should be aware of?”\n\n“I’m not sure if I want kids yet, but if I decide to have them it would likely be in my late 30’s or even early 40’s, thus IVF could be necessary. Maybe I could consider freezing my eggs at a younger age in order for that to have a higher chance of success?”\n\n“I’m queer and know I will want to use assited reproductive technologies to have children, but all of that can cost a lot of money. Maybe I could start saving or advocating for fertility benefits in my workplace?”\n\nAgain, none of this is personal or medical advice at all, but we think knowledge is power. If we can get educated on the options out there, understand the realistic costs and limitations that might exist, and reflect on how these options might fit into our own lives, then we have a lot more agency over our futures. We can avoid the “Oh Sh\\*t” moments, not miss out on options because we didn’t know or didn’t understand, and feel convicted in our decisions when it is time to make them.\n\n## 2: The Paradox of Partnership\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/The-Paradox-of-Partnership-e1ilpvg)\n\n## What is the “Paradox of Partnership?”\n\nWhen chatting with dozens of women between the ages of 21 and 40, partnership and lack of partnership are both used as reasons to delay thinking about family planning and fertility. We heard people in partnerships say “I’m not too worried about it, we’ll have these conversations once we get more serious about having kids” and people without partners say “I don’t have a partner so I don’t think about family planning yet.” Sound like you?\n\n## So, when are people planning for children?\n\nIn many cases, right before they start trying! Which, in our parents’ generation, made a bit more sense because marriage and children were essentially the default for everyone and timelines tended to move more quickly. Now, couples are waiting a lot longer not only to marry, but also to have kids. Many factors contribute to this, but according to [a study](https://modernfertility.com/modern-state-fertility-2020-sofi-career-money) by Sofi and Modern Fertility, 60% of respondents reported delaying childbearing due to not having enough money. Life costs more money nowadays, so getting to a place where we can fully provide for children is taking longer than for our parents, and we have pretty abysmal childcare support in this country to help us.\n\nOn top of that, there are higher numbers of women pursuing education and continued education, and more women working and advancing in their careers. Relationships and dating have changed, as well–in some ways it feels like we’re all slight commitment-phobes due to the rise of divorce rates we experienced with our parents’ generation.\n\nSo, all of this combined is pushing out the timeline for having kids. Which in some sense is awesome. It provides more opportunity to pursue other things outside of building a family. The only problem is that our ability to have biological children really does change over time. We can push out the timeline, but if the goalpost keeps moving back and back and back, eventually we could run into a situation where we just don’t have as many options as we did before. Most folks we’ve interviewed have pretty vague ideas of what it might look like to try to have kids at different stages of life given egg counts, fertility challenges, etc.\n\nHence, the need to plan ahead. We believe more forethought could go into what you want, outside of partnership. When you consider divorce rates averaging around 45–50%, the likelihood of raising children on your own or co-parenting from different households is actually quite high. This is not a fun statistic, but it was a reframe that helped us think through the realities of choosing to have children.\n\nWe also heard many stories of women experiencing a breakup at 35, 36, 37 with someone they thought they were going to marry and have kids with. That can’t be planned for, of course, but it’s a very real possibility–partnership is kind of a question mark! Doesn’t it feel a bit odd to hinge such a big decision on a question mark?\n\n## Yes! What do I do with this information?\n\nWe plan out almost everything else in our lives, so it’s interesting that we keep this sort of whimsical outlook of “it will fall into place!” Or “if it’s meant to be it will be” around having kids. We believe this is a conversation that is useful to have with ourselves, outside of partnership, so that we can handle possible changes in our lives with the grounding that we know what we want.\n\nWe’ve laid out some examples of guiding questions to think about with yourself, whether or not you have a partner:\n\n“I don’t have a partner at this moment and I’m like 75% sure I want kids in the future, but definitely not 100%…would I be willing to spend money on getting a fertility assessment or freezing my eggs now so that I can have some extra buffer room to decide?”\n\n“I definitely need to be on the same page about kids as my partner before marriage, but when I brought it up it kind of caught them off-guard. What do I really want kid-wise and what kind of timeline am I thinking about? What will I do if we don’t align?”\n\n“Thinking about future partners — I’d want to ask myself if I would feel confident raising a child with them if we did not stay together romantically in the future?”\n\n“What if I’m not even sure I want the 1:1 partnership model for the rest of my life? Would I consider having kids on my own? Would I want to be a “choice mom” (the new term for having children solo intentionally)?\n\n“Do I want multiple partners or a larger family unit to raise children with as a community?”\n\nNow, this is not to scare anyone or push folks to overplan. These are huge questions, and our answers can change over time. But knowing our options, being real about the various outcomes that could play out, and having a good sense of our own desires–detached from partnership–should set us up to have much more agency than if we put off thinking about children until we want to start trying.\n\n## 3: False Confidence in Options and Fertility Unit Economics\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/False-Optionality-e1ilq0l)\n\n## What is causing “false confidence” in fertility?\n\nWith rapid advancements in fertility technology and heavy investment in the space, it’s easy to believe that we will have plenty of options for conceiving when the time is right. There are some really exciting emerging technologies. However, due to high cost and mixed success rates of fertility interventions, our current options are actually less of a slam dunk than we think, and can lead to emotional and physical challenges.\n\nWe also seem to have a skewed understanding of the accessibility of these fertility interventions, partly from the influence of celebrity news and social media. In 2015, Gabrielle Union opened up about the shame she felt in prioritizing career over family building, leading her to pursue IVF in her 40’s. In 2016, Selena Gomez froze her eggs; her medical care team recommended considering the procedure before undergoing chemotherapy for Lupus. In 2018, Halsey froze her eggs at 23 due to her endometriosis diagnosis and related surgeries. In 2020, we learned more about Kim Kardashian’s fertility journey–during her first two pregnancies she experienced placenta accreta and gestational diabetes, a condition in which the placenta gets stuck inside the body during birth. Because of this, she chose to use surrogates for her third and fourth children. In 2021, we watched Heather Rae from Selling Sunsets document her fertility journey through IVF and embryo preservation on TikTok. And finally, in 2022, we learned Chrissy Teigen is using IVF to try for her third child and saw her share the all-too-common, but often private, pain of miscarriage.\n\nOn the one hand, this exposure is great. It’s passively trojan-horsing some of this fertility information to folks and normalizing conversations. But while exposure is good, it could also be giving us a false sense of security. We hear the ages of some of these celebrities and think “ah, I have all the time in the world.” However, for them, money isn’t an issue. They can afford as many cycles or procedures as it takes, and can seek out and travel to the best clinics in the world.\n\nWe also detected a lot of false confidence when speaking with women who use their mom’s story as an example of success. We heard things like, “well my mom had a kid at 39, so I’m probably good!” However, there are differences between our mothers’ generation and ours. Not only are we, on average, having kids later in life, there’s also more and more [evidence ](https://www.popsci.com/air-pollution-fertility-pregnancy/)that environmental factors like pollution affect fertility, and that fertility is generally on the decline.\n\nFertility struggles also are not limited to women. In fact, it’s a giant misconception and one that we need to set straight. In at least half of all cases of infertility, a male factor is a [major or contributing cause](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17201-male-infertility). While researchers aren’t sure what exactly is causing male-factor infertility–they mostly blame environmental factors–it is clear that male fertility is decreasing. In 1992, a [study](https://www.bmj.com/content/305/6854/609) found a global 50% decline in sperm counts in men over the previous 60 years. Multiple studies over subsequent years confirmed that initial finding, including a 2017 [paper](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/6/646/4035689) showing 50–60% decline in sperm concentration between 1973 and 2011 in men from around the world.\n\nSo what does this mean? We’re not trying to scare the shit out of everyone. But there’s no denying fertility is changing and the need for assisted reproductive technologies is increasing. We need to get real about how much different treatments cost and the likely success rates at different ages (because age matters here too) with assisted reproductive technologies like IUI, egg freezing, and IVF. With this information we can better plan, better save, and better prioritize when making life decisions, like potentially taking fertility benefits into account when job searching.\n\n## How much do fertility options really cost?\n\nTo begin, we need to make clear that most of these procedures are not covered by insurance, public or private. This is something not everyone knows. Unless it is deemed “medically necessary,” like in the case of women undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, it is not covered. And these guidelines are quite strict–we spoke with a woman undergoing chemo for an autoimmune disease who could not get egg freezing covered as “medically necessary” because it wasn’t cancer. This also typically excludes LGBTQ+ individuals who don’t meet the definitions of “infertility” that may qualify them for coverage. Even transgender individuals undergoing gender-affirming care may not meet the criteria for “infertility” that would cover them for fertility preservation (think: egg or sperm freezing).\n\nSo, most patients are paying out of pocket for these treatments, which can end up being well over $10,000, depending on the treatment. Let’s break it down. And shoutout to [FertilityIQ](https://www.fertilityiq.com/) — a super informative fertility education site that helped us source these numbers (this platform also costs money…nothing is free in this fertility world!).\n\n## IUI\n\nIUI, which stands for Intrauterine Insemination, is a procedure to put sperm directly inside the uterus, helping healthy sperm get closer to an egg. It is usually a “first try” for unexplained infertility. You may explore this if you have endometriosis or low sperm count/quality. It would also be used for same-sex female couples using donor sperm, or single women using donor sperm. It averages between $500-$4000 per cycle or “try,” essentially. The range is so wide because it can vary by medication pricing, monitoring and bloodwork, and the insemination procedure, so it mostly depends on the clinic you go to.\n\n## IVF\n\nIVF, which stands for In-Vitro Fertilization, is a procedure in which eggs and sperm are fertilized outside of the body in a test tube or petri dish, and then a viable fertilized embryo is put directly inside the uterus. It can be eggs and sperm from partners, or donor eggs / donor sperm. It is also often used with surrogates. This is often a next step in the unexplained infertility process, or for women who have fallopian tube damage/blockage, or other health concerns. IVF can cost well over $20,000 for one cycle when tallying the cost of treatment and medication–most women will average 2.1 cycles, bringing the total cost upwards of $40,000. Cost also depends on if you do genetic testing or other add-ons and is variable by clinic and by state.\n\n## Egg freezing\n\nEgg freezing is the last one we’ll cover, although there are many more fertility options. Egg freezing is a procedure in which eggs are extracted and then frozen using cryopreservation. It is used as a preservation measure, so that you can use the eggs later. You can freeze embryos (fertilized eggs) for preservation as well. On average, egg freezing patients will spend $30,000-$40,000 on treatment and storage. The breakdown is around $15,000 per cycle (to extract the eggs) and most women do an average of 2.1 cycles. Storage costs depend on location, but average around $500 per year.\n\nIt becomes even more complex when assessing the unit economics of fertility treatments. Freezing your eggs at 32 is a very different financial decision than freezing your eggs at 38, or 43 like Kourtney Kardashian. For example, you might be able to get 40 eggs in one round at age 32 for $20,000 with longer-term storage costs, and 20 eggs in three rounds at age 38 for $60,000 with reduced storage costs. We should be thinking not only about which fertility options might make sense for us, but also when those options make sense in the context of our wants and needs. It’s not fun to have to think about unit economics when thinking about the magic of having a baby! But that is exactly the kind of psychological barrier we hope to help women overcome.\n\n## So, what could I be thinking about?\n\nThere are a few companies popping up to make fertility procedures cheaper, which is exciting. That’s essentially [Kindbody’s](https://kindbody.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=kindbody&utm_term=kindbody&utm_campaign=__Kindbody+Brand&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=5349304425&hsa_cam=15158927904&hsa_grp=132895691881&hsa_ad=558827162131&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-482671827007&hsa_kw=kindbody&hsa_mt=p&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwspKUBhCvARIsAB2IYutVqaW_myuSzBGeZxOcosPqZGy-GuI_1dUAym-32IhnsXPZIIu6lHUaArX5EALw_wcB) premise–they’re improving user experience but also trying to drive down costs. But even at Kindbody, if you want to get a basic fertility assessment to find out where you’re at and if you should be worried, it can still be upwards of $300. In some states, insurance companies are required to cover a fertility assessment, so if you’re interested in getting a fertility workup done, talk to your OBGYN. They should be able to refer you to a clinic, and with that referral your insurance could cover it. But *always* ask upfront what your insurance will cover.\n\nThere are also companies like [Carrot Fertility](https://www.get-carrot.com/) or [Progyny](https://progyny.com/) that facilitate employers offering their employees fertility benefits. You could consider negotiating or advocating for fertility benefits in your current company or next job! And finally, there are companies like [Sunfish](https://joinsunfish.com/) offering financing and loans for fertility treatments.\n\nAdditionally, here are a few guiding questions you could ask yourself:\n\n“How do I feel about assisted reproductive technologies in general?”\n\n“Do I know what, if any, fertility coverage I currently have?”\n\n“If I have a partner(s), have we mutually discussed our feelings about ART? Does my partner have fertility benefits?”\n\n“I’m queer and would likely use ART to have a biological child with my partner, how might we plan for that?”\n\n“If I’m diagnosed with a fertility issue (about 10% of women have PCOS and 2–10% have endometriosis) and struggle to get pregnant naturally, how much money, if any, would I be willing to spend on assisted reproductive technology?”\n\n“Am I willing to start saving money (or advocating for benefits!) now to have a plan in place for if I might need ART?”\n\n## 4: Why We Might Not Want Kids\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/Why-We-Might-Not-Want-Kids-e1ilq28)\n\n## Let’s talk about this!\n\nObviously, it’s becoming increasingly socially acceptable to not want kids, but we don’t actually spend much structured time thinking or talking about the reasons why we do or do not want kids. We found in many cases in our interviews with women, it’s just referred to as a feeling. But where does this feeling come from? Is it subliminal social pressure? What your friends are doing? The next logical step in your relationship with your partner? Or, is it truly your own desire and intentional decision, one way or another?\n\nSo, let’s talk about why we might not want kids! Lack of a supportive partner, lifestyle and identity, climate change, and health concerns are all valid reasons for choosing not to have children and deserve some discussion to spark thoughtful reflection. And, even without children of your own, there are many ways to integrate children into your life if you still want to be around them.\n\n## Lack of supportive partner\n\nUnfortunately, the ever-present influence of traditional gender roles feeds into considerations around lack of a supportive partner. According to [happiness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness) expert Paul Dolan, a professor of behavioral science at the London School of Economics, women who are single with no children are actually the happiest. Dolan [explains](https://www.businessinsider.com/unmarried-childless-women-are-happiest-expert-says-2019-5) that while men derive benefits from [marriage](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/marriage), the same cannot generally be said for women. This statement is clearly very heteronormative and sweeping, and there are many really great marriages out there, but women are still typically the default for emotional and household labor within marriages, which gets exacerbated with children involved. Married heterosexual mothers notoriously take on more responsibilities than their male partners and very different responsibilities than their single women counterparts.\n\n## Lifestyle and identity\n\nHere, we want to touch on the concept of “regretting motherhood” which is super taboo in our society to talk about.\n\nSociologist Orna Donath published a book called [Regretting Motherhood,](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32302223-regretting-motherhood) which is a study on women who self-report regretting becoming mothers. There are many different reasons they became mothers in the first place–avoiding divorce, meeting family expectations, fitting in with friends, or simply because they thought it was the “next step”–and some of them actually did have a strong desire to be mothers before having kids, but all of them ended up regretting it when faced with the reality of motherhood.\n\nWe always hear about women who choose *not* to be mothers being warned that they will regret their decision later in life, but we really don’t talk about the possibility that the opposite could also be true — that a woman who becomes a mother might regret it. This brings us back to women dealing with most of the emotional and household labor in heterosexual relationships–the burden of childbearing often does fall primarily on the woman, which is a very real factor to consider depending on your relationship. Looking at the realities of the lifestyle changes and identity changes that come along with having kids, you might just decide you are not down for that shift and really value your autonomy, which is a completely valid choice.\n\n## Climate change\n\nClimate change is a very real consideration for a lot of folks in the decision of whether or not to have kids. In our parents’ generation, they still had plenty of societal issues going on that could make them wary of bringing children into the world (ex. war, economic stress, etc.), but it wasn’t at quite the same level of climate change–our world is fully on fire and not on track to stabilize.\n\nGiven the trajectory we’re on, there’s definitely questions of: “What kind of world am I bringing my kids into?” “Where should we live so that we’re not at constant threat of floods, fires, famine, etc., and can we even afford that?” For some, this feels more pressing than for others, but certainly we’re hearing more and more about people choosing not to have children due to climate change.\n\nWe are absolutely not trying to be doomsday here, and there’s an argument on the flip-side of all this where having children is actually a sign of sustained hope for the world, but we just want to validate the fact that you might have considered this and that you are not crazy for factoring climate into your decision-making.\n\n## Health concerns\n\nFinally, health concerns are a valid consideration. Maybe you are already dealing with a health condition that meaningfully affects your life and you do not know how a pregnancy or the stress of having children might impact your own personal health. We spoke with a woman who has a very intense autoimmune disease and is worried about taking care of a child while also trying to manage her disease. Obviously, our society should have better resources for and access to childcare, which would solve many of these problems, but within our current reality this is a serious consideration.\n\nEven the act of giving birth can come with serious health risks that are rarely talked about. [303,000](https://everymothercounts.org/our-story/the-issue/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwspKUBhCvARIsAB2IYuucoFuxdQwdJE4OyzDt4eGzFYrpU5MOFsJEDNZWagVR3FhDXp6sFzwaAhVzEALw_wcB) women die around the world as a result of complications of pregnancy and childbirth every year, and due to inequitable care, Black Women in the US have the highest [maternal mortality rate](https://usafacts.org/articles/the-us-maternal-mortality-rate-peaked-during-the-pandemic-and-was-highest-for-black-women/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=ND-Healthcare&gclid=Cj0KCQjwspKUBhCvARIsAB2IYutgrWUncb-QfJGc1JhdkS2mNZQbTxcO2t3O1wry1n1lTQJxH4B1d64aAp-VEALw_wcB), more than two times worse than that of any other racial or ethnic group.\n\nAdditionally, we are not told much about birthing until it happens to us. Even with more and more women opening up about the realities of childbirth on social media, we are still wildly uninformed when it comes to what happens to our bodies during and after childbirth. Even miscarriages are taboo, yet 10–20% of known pregnancies end in them. For some women, this might have a meaningful impact on whether or not they want to be a birthing parent and thus it should not remain a taboo topic.\n\n## What can I be thinking about?\n\nSo, there are a lot of reasons you might not want kids. We have a really strong narrative in society that parenthood will be the best thing that ever happened to you. However, we heard a quote recently that we loved along the lines of, “We are told parenthood will be the best thing that ever happened to you, but if you don’t become a parent or don’t want to,\\* something else \\*will be the best thing that ever happened to you.” You’ll always have a best thing! The best thing is not the same for everyone.\n\nThe status quo and cultural expectation is still to have children, but women are still sacrificing the most with having kids. So we hope that the decision of whether or not to have kids becomes more intentional– one you truly have conviction in. Also, experiencing the positive impacts of “nurturing” something does not have to be children. It could be nurturing your relationships, your community, the world in whatever way feels right to you. Or, if you are really inclined to nurture children, there are a million ways to integrate kids into your life even if they are not your own.\n\nHere are some guiding questions to consider:\n\n“Have I thought about all the ways my lifestyle would change if I were to have kids? Am I okay with that? “\n\n“Do I want kids of my own or just kids in my life in general?”\n\n“Do I feel like I would be taking on the role of primary caregiver in my relationship if we were to have kids, and if so, am I okay with that?”\n\n“Do I feel that bringing a child into the world is something I’m comfortable with given my own personal feelings about the trajectory our world is on?”\n\n“Does having the right partner meaningfully impact whether or not I would want kids?”\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nUltimately, the goal of this article is to help women avoid the “Oh Sh\\*t” moment we keep hearing about, where they get totally blindsided by fertility challenges.

American media began to black James", "body": "Did James really dominate the deal\n\nOn February 6 Beijing time, the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Indiana Pacers 94-136 away. It is worth mentioning that the Lakers were 23 points behind the Pacers at the end of the half-time. In the game, when Ingram made a free throw, the fans were shouting at him: LeBron is going to trade you.\n\nAt the end of the half-time, the US media spoofed James and sent a text message to the magician: “trade Anthony Davis quickly, or I will continue to sit on the bench in the second half.” At present, the Lakers are in the vortex of public opinion in the transaction. In such a transaction, the team’s hearts are naturally scattered. More importantly, almost everyone of these young players has been sent to the shelves by the management.\n\nIn the latest development of today’s transaction, the Lakers gave the final offer: Ball brother + Kuzma + Ingram + Hart + zubartz + pop + two first round signings for Anthony Davis and Solomon hill. At that time, when looking at the offer, Chumei had praised it, but then the offer was rejected by the pelican, and the Lakers withdrew all transactions about Chumei.\n\nAnd every offer from the Lakers, Ingram and Kuzma are listed. No wonder the fans will react like this today! In this battle, Ingram got 12 points and 6 rebounds. （Emily）", "timestamp": 1653252533, "digest": "LAvX7Qz2iURoEc4Zg6EbJ5vs54Pf9mCNNJUbfivLO-s", "contributor": "0x4e5A16d837674fD858686D895Ce0a6ED3988FD2f"}

The announcement also said that a few days earlier, Shuangliang energy conservation also signed orders for crystalline silicon reduction furnace of more than 324 million yuan.\n\nAccording to the announcement released by Shuangliang energy conservation on the 9th, Dongfang Risheng expects to purchase 1.572 billion monocrystalline silicon chips from the wholly-owned subsidiary of Shuangliang energy conservation from 2022 to 2024.\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, Shuangliang energy conservation entered the silicon wafer market. Since this year, the company has deepened the layout of photovoltaic field, promoted the differentiated development of photovoltaic business, and realized strategic coordination with the industrial chain. While opening up orders, Shuangliang’s energy-saving industry gradually became clear, forming two “carbon neutral” related sectors of “energy conservation and water saving” and “new energy”.\n\nShuangliang energy conservation said that since the company started the silicon wafer business, it has signed long silicon material purchase orders with Xinte, ASI, Jiangsu Zhongneng and other enterprises, and the silicon material supply has always been stable. In addition to solid orders on hand, the technical advantages and continuous iteration of the silicon wafer business also continue to ensure the market development ability of the business. So far, Shuangliang energy conservation has signed a long silicon wafer / silicon rod order, with an amount of about 77.9 billion yuan.\n\nAccording to the announcement on the 9th, the subject of another single contract signed by Shuangliang energy conservation is a multi pair rod polysilicon reduction furnace, with a contract amount of 324 million yuan. In the field of reduction furnace, Shuangliang energy-saving ploughing takes longer. Shuangliang energy saving was founded in 1982. After going public in 2003, it began to layout photovoltaic business and provide polysilicon reduction furnace for downstream silicon wafer manufacturers. In 2022, the amount of newly signed orders for polysilicon reduction furnace has reached 1.886 billion yuan.\n\nIt is understood that Shuangliang energy conservation also continues to promote upstream and downstream cooperation in the industrial chain, forming an industrial layout from “series” to “parallel” with reduction furnace customers, silicon wafer customers and component customers.\n\nToday, the photovoltaic business has brought strong performance growth to Shuangliang energy conservation. In the first quarter of this year, Shuangliang energy conservation achieved an operating revenue of 1.734 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 299.5%.\n\nThe relevant person in charge of Shuangliang energy conservation said that with rich industry experience and close customer relationship, the company will build a new growth pole, so as to accelerate the strategic layout from professional equipment manufacturers to zero carbon green energy solution providers.", "timestamp": 1653252720, "digest": "oTeE_kgvkjhjNdrAnXgfAXSTHOG4fGNFfpn4FTe-g7Q", "contributor": "0x0d85Db479c9A5249ac9d78ad2BaF52C07788392C"}

One must say that the world's best workspace is not possible without the world's best people like them, and while the void is deep, they left a Polaris to look up to.\n\nUnless you’re secretly a billionaire — or Elon Musk — you probably want to work at your dream job one day (read: every day).\n\nThere are a few challenges with doing that.\n\n1. You’ll have to figure out *what* your dream job is, which is a little more challenging than it sounds.\n2. When you’ve figured out your dream job — and you might’ve guessed this — finding that place and getting hired for the role you want is a *LOT* more challenging than it sounds.\n\nI’ve always known that I didn’t have it in me to work a toxic full-time \\*\\*\\*\\*job.\n\nI also know that those sorts of jobs permeate Nigeria’s job market, giving workers fewer good options than they deserve.\n\nBeing able to pick the sort of jobs I work at is a privilege I am forever grateful for; most of my working life has been with amazing companies and organizations with kind, caring coworkers.\n\nGood for me, right?

Big tech companies control the platforms and tools we use every day — from Google’s search engine to Meta’s suite of social apps to the app you’re reading this article on.\n\nThey own the platforms. They make the rules.\n\nThis contrasts starkly with “Web3,” which uses [peer-to-peer technology](https://ntkris.substack.com/p/what-can-web3-solve-for-users?s=r) to let people access anything on the internet without giving up power to one person.\n\nThe next thing you want to know about is the meaning of “DAO.” A DAO is a community of people working on Web3 who prefer to be autonomous.\n\nThey don’t like big tech owning all the most used internet software, and they don’t want to follow rules that may not be in their best interests as users.\n\n“DAO” is an acronym for Decentralised Autonomous Organisation:\n\n* “Decentralised” = “There isn’t one person in charge. Everyone can be in charge.”\n* “Autonomous” = “We make our own rules.”\n* The word organization shares that it’s not a company but a group of people aligned to one goal.\n\nThere are hundreds of DAOs, and each one is creating projects that help you do anything from save the environment to travel luxuriously.\n\nHere’s the last thing you should know.\n\n“Regen,” aka regenerative\\*,\\* means a lot of things. Their sum is “**practices that use Web3 to improve the world for *everyone’s* benefit**.”\n\nTherefore, a Regen DAO is a decentralized, autonomous organization that uses Web3 to improve the world for everyone’s benefit.\n\nI mentioned earlier that, on Web2, the people who own the platform make the rules. That can be a bad thing, and here’s an example from my life.\n\nIn early 2020, I applied to volunteer with a large org working on a cause I care deeply about.\n\nMy role was at the grassroots level — I would interact directly with the kids we were helping through the organization’s key program, report to directors in my region (community leaders I looked up to), and help reach more young participants.\n\nI was stoked.\n\n… for all of two weeks.\n\nBarely a fortnight after I joined, the org was draining me. I got near midnight calls and messages from program participants (I didn’t sign up for these, but someone needed to take them) and was pressured into working as late as 3 am on tasks assigned to my team.\n\nI was burning out.\n\nFast.\n\nOn top of all this, I had life and online school to think about, but the org didn’t have a system to let me reduce my hours or share my needs, and my only other teammate was even more burnt out than I was.\n\nThe most stressful part of the endeavor — and the one that made me quit first thing in the morning after a crying, screaming breakdown at 2 a.m. in my mother’s dining room — was that the deadlines were unachievable for anyone but [Kyle XY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_XY).\n\nI had come into the org wanting to use excellent marketing to further the cause but rarely had time to think of my personal social content goals, much less post anything for them.\n\nOur manager was toxic. They beat volunteers down verbally and then gaslit workers into thinking of the verbal abuse as “constructive feedback.” This manager’s superior communicated with and deferred to them in all things, so volunteers had no one to turn to.\n\nI quit. Obviously.\n\nBut that situation could have been so much better. You’ll find the key problems from that story in almost every company at various levels of solved-ness. Let’s call them **the Workplace Ruinators**.\n\nI haven’t encountered a regen DAO with this problem because most DAO models work using “contributors” instead of “hires.”\n\nA contributor has more role flexibility than a hire ever can from the get-go. In most cases, you can look at what a DAO is doing and contribute if it appeals to you.\n\nThen you choose *how* you want to contribute. The DAO may pay you per project, with a salary, a stipend, or a mix of each, depending on how it operates.\n\nWhat happens if you change your mind about how you want to contribute?\n\nYou switch it up. Contributors tackle a problem or provide a needed service within a DAO: You’re golden as long as you can help.\n\n***Workplace Ruin averted.***\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1192/1\\*ZksPAFlrW25Uw7w5Cgqfdw.jpeg)\n\nNot every regen DAO operates with contributors alone. But when they do, you’re asking for a specific role in a project you’re genuinely psyched about, so you don’t have to deal with aspects of the job that make you go “eek.”\n\nIn regen DAOs, work is not assigned. You ask for it or are invited. (Invited here is *an actual invite*. None of that passive-aggressive, “We’re pretending you have a choice” stuff.)\n\nAnd, if you’re on a project where you like *some* of the work — but not all of it — there’s almost always going to be a contributor eager to help by doing the thing you dislike.\n\nAll DAOs promote a fast, collaborative, “make it happen” culture. Picture yourself in that environment: a contract or full-time worker doing work you don’t like or cannot excel at.\n\nRegen DAO leaders and other collaborators are glad (read: completely understanding and *happy)* to take such work off your hands.\n\nHow does this situation play out in a Regen DAO?\n\n**On having fun at work:** Web3 is meme culture at its best. Regen web3 is even better: Everyone appreciates the value of a workplace where all contributors feel valued, accepted, and heard. And, like GitcoinDAOs [Memeapalooza](https://twitter.com/GitcoinDAO/status/1499827748117913604?t=g2L1tjf7QW-smrFldJ31_Q&s=19) event, everyone *has fun*.\n\n**On communicating with managers and sharing ideas without anxiety:** DAO contributors in leadership are paradigms of this culture; using a “Yes, and” mentality when faced with new ideas, facilitating collaboration, and ensuring everyone is aware of the resources available to them. DreamDAO co-founder Gary Sheng is a great example:\n\nGary’s reflections while learning in public.\n\nLeaders like Sean Mannis of Gitcoin’s MMM (Merch, Memes, and Marketing) workstream push for workplace innovation that makes it easy to get constructive feedback and recognition from your peers and do work that fits in your life.\n\nSounds fantastic.\n\n**On inclusion and diversity**\n\nI can’t 100% say that every Regen DAO does its best to make a workplace that is openly inclusive. However, they *do* create environments that scorn prejudice and marginalization. They also create environments where anyone feels encouraged to propose a project changing things that may make people feel unsafe to be themselves.\n\nMost importantly, all this is decentralized. Everyone gets a say in who leads, how they lead, and what they do. Gitcoin founder Kevin Owocki puts it best [when he says](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/consent-of-the-governed-and-legitimacy-by-process-in-gitcoindao/9778), “The consent of the governed is the only legitimate basis for government.”\n\n# **Final Thoughts**\n\nDoing work you genuinely love should be easier than it is today. As humans, we should only have to do work stuff that we *actually enjoy* in workplaces that make it easy to be happy.\n\nI found these sorts of workplaces as an independent editor at [Craft Your Content](https://www.craftyourcontent.com/) and a writer at [Coin Central](https://coincentral.com/author/jemimah-jones/), both Web2-native companies.\n\nIt’s not impossible. It’s just easier when you work in regen Web3.\n\n**Things to note:**\n\n1. If you’re a manager at a traditional web2 company, consider that your team members (and company) will benefit from applying some principles in this post.\n2. If you’re like me, looking for the world’s best workplaces, consider contributing to a regen DAO. Here’s [how to contribute to GitcoinDAO](https://www.notion.so/8035f41cf1194022b03c579791f32ca7), where I work.\n3. If you do not consider anything I’ve shared, please consider avoiding situations that lead to Zombified-Worker Syndrome. You deserve better.\n\nLike this article?

{"id": "wJJQyzl87__muSIcHNv5r53_0GmoIKnAoK7ksKn0qKs", "title": "New consumption observation | Guochao Li Ning starts selling coffee | one trillion coffee market adds another cross-border giant | see you every day on the cover", "body": "Cover news reporter Wu Yujia\n\nRecently, Li Ning Sports (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. has applied for the registration of the trademark “Ning coffee”, officially announcing its entry into the coffee industry.\n\nShould the leader of sports brand “Guochao” layout the coffee market? For a time, it has aroused widespread concern in the industry. There are different opinions on whether to play tickets or test the water. According to some insiders, coffee is more “embellishment” stores for Li Ning group, but others believe that this is opening up a new track.\n\nDuring the discussion, Li Ning’s official response said: the company pays attention to the consumer purchase experience of retail terminals, hopes to improve customers’ comfort and experience during shopping by optimizing in store services, and provide coffee services in the store, which will be an innovative attempt of Li Ning for the consumer experience of retail terminals.\n\nFrom the official response, coffee for Li Ning is more about improving the store experience than trying to open up a new track.\n\nFirst of all, from a market perspective, coffee is one of the hottest consumption tracks in recent years. According to the data, in 2021, the scale of China’s coffee market was about 381.7 billion yuan. Some institutions predict that by 2025, the scale of the domestic coffee market will reach 1 trillion yuan, with a growth rate of 27.2%, far exceeding the global average of 2%. Facing the fast-growing track, capital has already poured in. According to data, from 2013 to 2021, coffee related projects were financed 114 times, with a disclosed amount of more than 11.5 billion yuan. Whether in terms of market scale or financing performance, the coffee track is worth Li Ning’s try.\n\nSecondly, from the development stage, as an emerging industry, China’s coffee market is still in a relatively early stage. There are many domestic coffee brands. Starbucks, Tim Hortons, Costa and other international chain coffee brands are positioned as slow coffee scenes, focusing on the third space social networking; The “slow coffee camp” represented by% Arabica, m stand and seesaw is more about building brand awareness through stores, paying attention to the creation of aesthetic atmosphere, and taking high-quality coffee as its own; Novartis coffee, Ruixing coffee and man coffee are the representatives of high price coffee. The “fast coffee scene” is used to meet the needs of people who take coffee as their daily needs, and take the cost-effective route.\n\nIn addition, there are also some new cross-border players. Many industry giants such as “two barrels of oil”, China Post, Wanda, Tongrentang and even Goubuli have been involved in the coffee business one after another. In 2018, PetroChina established “Kunlun hospitality coffee” and sold freshly ground coffee in its Kunlun hospitality convenience store. In 2021, “hospitable coffee” opened more than 120 stores in 20 provinces and cities, with sales of more than 100 million yuan. The product line includes freshly ground coffee and ready to drink coffee. In 2019, Sinopec Yijie convenience store with nearly 30000 stores released a new brand “Yijie coffee”. In October 2019, Tongrentang Health Pharmaceutical Group’s new retail brand “Zhima health” experience store opened and launched medlar latte, Luohanguo American style and other “herbal” coffee. In February 2022, China Post announced that the country’s first post office coffee shop would officially land in Xiamen. On February 23, Tianjin “Goubuli steamed stuffed bun” also announced its entry into the Bureau and established gaoleya coffee.\n\nWhat are Li Ning’s advantages in choosing to cross into the coffee track at this time? First, the number of stores. Compared with Ruixing with 6024 stores, Starbucks with 5654 stores in China and Nova coffee with more than 1500 stores in the same period, Li Ning coffee with more than 7000 outlets has certain advantages in scale. Once fully or partially launched, it is a force that can not be underestimated.\n\nSecondly, different from the brand positioning of professional coffee making, the core logic behind Li Ning’s move is more similar to the business idea of resource reuse or new satisfaction of traffic. By improving the store experience, attracting young consumer groups and approaching generation Z, Li Ning’s national fashion image of China is strengthened.\n\nInsiders pointed out that for brand entities, building scenes that consumers can experience and deeply perceive in time will become a key measure of market competition in the future.\n\nAs for whether this decision can really consolidate the brand barrier and become a new driving force for enterprises to move forward, it takes time to give the final answer.", "timestamp": 1653252903, "digest": "0HOkmLR_QcckY8V_ZC9w9qfwh37K40rfKExjzHLsWdI", "contributor": "0x587883E7cc65ED49d14a8763507733692d1E901C"}

Centered around on-chain ESG metrics, HASH DAO is focused on providing a growing open-source library of genetics, farming methods, hash processing, entheogenic plant treatment, and community healing protocols available through a multi-tiered token.\n\n**Creating the Future of Tech, Innovation, & Culture**\n\nHighly Autonomous Systems of Horticulture (**$HASH**) : Utilizing smart contracts to automate and democratize production, supply chain, and governance in the cannabis & psychedelic Industry.\n\nWe created $HASH to allow the craft growers who put the plant first and under-represented communities easier access into the cannabis space and the emerging technologies of Web3.\n\n*“Decades of marijuana prohibition and high incarceration rates for marijuana convictions has left many people out of the legal marijuana boom.”*\n\n> **Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over $20 Billion and is projected to 10x in the next decade.\n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\nCorporate cannabis companies operate and control the majority of the space, leaving legacy operators and small brands without capital solutions to scale their businesses and do not take into consideration all of it’s stakeholders :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oXXVXLuIXOQoXtXRqzBXV.png?height=621&width=904)\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of the BIPOC community for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands  exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market. With the integration of digital identities, NFTs/Web3 purchasing, and automation, many of these problems are easily solved.\n\n![Exclusive Libraries of Genetics & Phenos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-8T4OrLTcNOJxW2vLerl-.jpg?height=1866&width=1536)\n\n*Solution?* Creating community-ownership of the vertically-integrated $HASH Supply Chain of production, processing, distributing, and operating on-chain craft cannabis  compliance geared toward Web3 adoption. Information, data security, and their applications are essential for business optimization and transparency. Although there are many ERP solutions for the industry already, our governance will be centered around cannabis supply chain and DeFi dApps that utilize NFT-based SKU’s to generate active product data and create on-chain interactions that comply with ESG metrics, paving the way for global regulations and the future of the cannabis space.\n\nDeveloping Horticulture Public Goods : BIPOC Horticulture Initiative, Open-Source Library of Genetics, Strains and Phenos, Regenerative Farming Methods & Techniques, Cannabis Production, Processing, Entheogenic Cultivation, Medicinal Protocols, and a Community-Practitioner Directory\n\nCommunity-Governance over the liquidity, yield-farming, and major-user decisions in the tokenization of HASH DAO.\n\nHASH DAO Governance is the future of the industry standard, and to do this we will start by partnering with one successful Emerald Triangle, Northern California craft cannabis-brand with community-staking of its future scaling of operations and expanding a compilation of automation protocols through smart contracts.\n\n**ON-CHAIN SUPPLY NFTs + ACTIVE INVENTORY TRACKING + CRYPTO TRANSACTIONS = Web3 PoS**\n\n**World’s First Cannabis DAO Founded On**:\n\nBIPOC-equity and engineered around community-development governed by craft cannabis operators, backed by IRL projects.\n\n**On-Chain Protocols + Smart Contracts = The Automated Horticulture of Tomorrow**\n\nCreating a future:\n\n* Geared to the love and cultivation of the plant and Mother Earth\n* Onboarding BIPOC leaders and creatives onto the blockchain\n* Compensating intellectual property proportionally to fulfill smart contracts\n\n> **HASH DAO = Power Back in Your Hands**\n\nReinvention of the Horticulture Supply Chain and Data Distribution via smart contracts that allow for automation and help individuals to create ownership over community-led projects, intellectual property, digital assets, and dApps.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M6C2p0sNHx37p783TEv9D.jpg?height=822&width=1125)\n\n**First Wins for HASH DAO**\n\n> “Community Ownership of Physical and Digital Assets”\n\nMinting a multi-tiered HASH DAO NFT with the top governance tier going for $10 K, raising a total of $11.5 M for an initial $HASH treasury. As funds become available, proceeds will immediately go to partnering with South Face Mangement to purchase over 30 acres in Mendocino and 40+ acres Humbolt County. This will include the scaling of a vertically-integrated nursery and farm as well as it’s statewide distribution of award-winning products under Uncle Mac’s brand and South Face Farms Management.\n\n**Project #1 :**  Carry out renovation on the farm and nursery to ensure full-scale ESG-metric compliance and how to bring all aspects of the farm and it’s production on-chain, from SKU NFT’s to utilizing energy consumption data for carbon credit checks. Partnering with Uncle Mac’s, a Northern California craft cannabis brand, & South Face Management, parent company to Flower Wheel Nursery, South Face Farms Cultivation, and Uncle Mac’s brand.\n\n**Project #2 :** Onboard visual and 3D artists who will design branding and assets for the Metaverse and we develop cross-chain NFT’s to be dropped on various play-to-earn games. We will also be acquiring digital plots of real estate to build “Metaverse farms” and “digital dispensaries” where a user can view the product, find out all of it’s information, and have it eventually delivered through an on-chain transaction. Along with digital land we will also be investing in domain names, including various strain names, cannabis celebrities, and psychedelic culture. Explore liquidity pools and yield farming with assets and treasury.\n\n**Project #3 :** Developing the Whitethorne Wash House, operating at an Emerald Triangle legacy property. This on-chain Hash House, the home lab for Uncle Mac’s brand hash production, will operate as a wholesale fresh frozen supply chain solution for transportation, storage, distribution and hash toll processing.\n\n**Project #4** : Getting $HASH in your hands. This is our farm-to-table craft cannabis buyers club providing direct-to-consumer access to exclusive SKU’s from legacy brands in the Emerald Triangle. This will include obtaining a retail and event license to launch Nephew’s Automated.\n\n**Project #5 :** Aggregating a library of horticulture public goods & building the Biodiversity BIPOC Glamping Learning Initiative; start building Marijuana for Minorities Program to co-create $HASH University creating content with some of the best small-batch growers and washers in the industry. (Community Online Education)\n\n**Project #6 :** Nephew’s will be applying for its event space license building the foundation for Akasha, an immersive psychedelic A/R Lounge for BIPOC community healing. The distribution and delivery will be a warehouse that will have an on-chain ESG-metric system in the back and a public access immersive art space in the front. We will also be looking into developing a portfolio of boutique cannabis bud and breakfasts in emerging global cannabis markets.\n\n**Project #7 :** We will be finding ERP solutions to develop state-of-the-art horticulture automation and Web3 technologies, based upon on-chain governance and compliance, to pave the way for the international industry standard by working towards meeting ESG-metric compliance. Our final goal is developing complete automation systems without compromising craft horticulture. From driverless deliveries, farm drone surveillance & data collection to utilize machine-learning and AI and to understand buyer behavior, horticulture improvements, growth optimization, etc.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QcqQLT4DyBHuQRaaputgr.png?height=560&width=997)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653253005, "digest": "jnsLcgStN8lRzxU8kXxyzenqIy65Wc-9QjToTmHRd3M", "contributor": "0x954fA8cfb797a26D4878ee212004889a2C9D7624"}

(source: vogue fashion)\n\nFitness coach private teaching\n\nUnless you are not human, it is not possible to live 100% according to the health guidelines. Yes, we can try to choose a healthy breakfast, but no one can completely abandon alcohol, caffeine, starch and midnight snack! If you agree that the key to a healthy life lies in balance, rather than strictly adhering to a single healthy choice at every step, then we have some good news for you. The pursuit of a healthy life does not mean a complete innovation. Here are 25 simple tips told by the fitness coach. It is very simple to implement, but it can bring us great changes in the long run.\n\nBreathing training: conscious breathing will help stabilize hormones, calm stress and optimize metabolism and digestive system. If you don’t breathe properly, you may miss one of the basic ways to keep your best health. I encourage my guests to find five minutes a day, lie flat, raise their legs and try abdominal breathing Bridget Jane， New Leaf Nutriti\n\nPay attention to vitamin B intake: vitamin B intake from green leafy vegetables can help relieve stress, increase deep sleep, and make you more focused during the day—— Yoga instructor Dani Lieberman\n\nSleep with essential oil: use some essential oil in the bedroom when sleeping. My favorite is lavender fragrance, which can calm you down and get deeper sleep—— Marissa Vicario, integrated nutrition health coach\n\nEat less factory bred animal products: this can reduce the intake of chemical hormones and antibiotics. Or reduce adult meat intake, such as the meat free day every week, or choose grass fed and free fed ranch animal products - Jennifer cassetta, Institute for integrated nutrition health coach\n\nUse app to record: I will choose cycle tracking app to record my periodic changes. The app can help me understand the impact of my hormones on diet, stress, exercise and other living habits. It can also record your mood, physical symptoms, weight, drugs, sex and body temperature. Understanding your body is one of the basic elements of maintaining a long-term healthy life. An app can help you understand your body Bridget Jane， New Leaf Nutrition\n\nTips for fitness and weight loss\n\nTry canned salad: try some salad recipes that can be saved in cans. They are very simple and beautiful and can be used as a working lunch. Put your favorite ingredients in the glass for lunch every morning—— Maria Marlowe, Institute for integrated nutrition health coach\n\nDownload a meditation app: do you think such an app is a waste of time? Wrong! Just 10 minutes of meditation a day can make you work more efficiently and even help you make better decisions. I use Deepak choprah’s mediation app. “- Jennifer cassetta, Institute for integrated nutrition health coach and personal trainer\n\nStay away from refined sugar: in addition to weight gain, sugar is also the culprit of chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, heart disease, poor memory and diabetes. And the more you eat sugar, the more you crave sugar. Make a three-day sugar free diet plan. Because you don’t eat sugar at all, you won’t crave sugar too much. This meal includes healthy fats, proteins, vegetables and fruits. When your taste buds get used to the natural sweet food of fruit, you will soon find that the biscuits and desserts you used to talk about are too sweet for you now. If you reduce your refined sugar intake, you will become healthier and slimmer Maria Marlowe, Institute for integrated nutrition health coach and personal trainer\n\nTongue scraping: it sounds a little disgusting, but don’t be afraid. The tongue scraper can not only clean, but also inhibit dental plaque bacteria and make your Breath fresher. Tongue scraper is a U-shaped metal tool, which can be bought in pharmacies or online. It can scrape off bacteria and food residues on the surface of the tongue Marissa Vicario, Institute for integrated nutrition health coach and personal trainer\n\nEat more probiotics: it’s good to get started with probiotic supplements, but many people don’t seem to realize the benefits. Therefore, I would recommend that customers take probiotics through sauerkraut, kimchi and black tea fungus. Another benefit of this is that eating different foods allows you to harvest different intestinal bacteria that are good for you Robyn Youkilis, Institute for integrated nutrition health coach\n\nDon’t be lazy for the sake of good health\n\nPrepare a week’s menu in advance: preparing a menu in advance on Sunday can minimize the time you spend in the kitchen and make it easier to control a healthy eating plan for the whole week. Make a menu, roast vegetables, cook grains, and prepare a lot of protein. Then just heat it on weekdays. By mixing different ingredients, you don’t have to worry about getting bored eating the same thing all week Personal trainer, Marlowe Institute for nutrition", "timestamp": 1653253434, "digest": "MjrEvncA3WYBHsAR-t4zeBhc7JL--JNXuVDK_PMMUS8", "contributor": "0xDa0E4c747C5FED5243e69fcF4eDC3e327f170E1A"}

If those beautiful feelings and wishes are only cherished and enshrined on the table of expectation, they can only be eclipsed by the dust accumulated in the abrasion of years.\n\nAn autumn rain, a cold. When the temperature dropped suddenly, I opened the wardrobe and wanted to turn over a thick cotton padded jacket to keep out the cold, but I accidentally found a clothes tightly wrapped in several layers of plastic bags in the corner of the drawer at the bottom of the wardrobe. What kind of clothes are you taking care of so carefully? I haven’t worn it for a long time. I almost forget it. So I carefully peeled off the outer package layer by layer. It turned out to be an outdated but still straight and gorgeous wool skirt. Suddenly, an indescribable emotion came to my mind. This beautiful wool skirt was once a favorite dress I bought a few years ago. It is expensive and exquisite. But because I like it so much, I don’t want to wear it more. I wear it on my body only a few days after the annual Chinese new year, attending friends’ banquets and attending important meetings. Then I take care of it carefully and put it in the cabinet, like a devout monk silently worshipping his God in my heart.\n\nBut the number of times I wear it is too small. Over time, I gradually forget its existence. Until today, I see it as new, but it is out of date and can’t wear it out anymore. The love for it and the joy of wearing it all dissipated in the abrasion of these years, leaving only infinite regret. If only I had worn it more than once!\n\ntoo late to regret\n\nWe always habitually hide the people and things we love most carefully, and stubbornly think that we can always keep the beauty and the long joy at the moment, but we never know that happiness and joy are just a state of mind, and it also has a fresh-keeping period. If you don’t do what you want to do at the moment you value most, it will slip away. The scenery flows and the time and space changes. No matter how hard we try to recall, all we leave is a helpless sigh, “how I liked it at the beginning!”.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, my 88 year old grandmother died, which has become my eternal regret. Every spring when flowers bloom, I always want to take advantage of my spare time to take her trembling hand, take her through the mossy slate Road, out of the ancient alley, take her out of the creaking attic, go to the city where I live, see the colorful neons, stand in the high office building, see the flying fireflies on the viaduct, or go to the beach on the edge of the city, Look at the white waves on the beach and the skyline at the end of the sea.\n\nHowever, this wish has never been realized. My work is getting busier and busier, and there are more and more trivial things at home. Often on Grandma’s birthday, I can only rush back with a cake to have a good meal with her, and then I promise her, “next time, I will take time to take you!” This promise is carefully folded and enshrined in the cellar where there is no sunshine. It is full of dust on miscellaneous days and rots in the dense soil. I didn’t regret until I saw my grandmother lying on the hospital bed getting thinner and thinner, like an old tree with fallen leaves in the autumn wind. I listened to her nagging and vaguely reciting something to me. I let my tears fall.\n\nThe past can’t be changed, and the future can’t be guessed. All we can do is now to make the joy and happiness more mellow. Don’t let years run out of fragrance in waiting for empty checks; Don’t appreciate the sadness before you know how to cherish your clothes and the people in front of you.

Later, the company determined that Han Bing was inseparable from the company’s financial system problems and reported the case.\n\nAccording to the extraction, inspection and identification of the electronic data judicial identification center of the national information center and the judicial identification of Beijing Zhonghai Yixin Information Technology Co., Ltd. on the site of Lianjia company and Han Bing’s apple computer, the host name Yggdrasil and MAC address of the defendant Han Bing’s apple computer are consistent with the access terminal corresponding to the host name and IP address of the equipment accessed by the client ID assigned by the on-site login server on the day of the crime, The court found that in its behavior log on June 4, 2018, it was recorded that it logged in to the financial system to execute the - shred and - RM orders for deletion.\n\nAfter the identification of computer records and the video materials provided by the chain family, the court of first instance found Han Bing guilty of damaging the computer information system and sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment. Since then, Han Bing filed an appeal, and his defender believed that the facts of the case were unclear and the evidence was insufficient, which could not rule out reasonable doubt, and the suspected crime should be avoided. However, the court finally rejected the appeal in the second instance and upheld the original judgment.\n\nWith regard to the legal basis for the defendant Han Bing being sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment in this case, lawyer Xia Hailong of Shanghai Shenlong law firm analyzed to reporters 21 that according to the provisions of the criminal law, if the perpetrator commits the crime of destroying computer information system, the consequences are particularly serious, he shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of more than five years, According to the relevant provisions of the interpretation of the Supreme People’s court and the Supreme People’s Procuratorate on Several Issues concerning the application of law in handling criminal cases endangering the security of computer information systems, if the perpetrator causes an economic loss of more than 50000 yuan, it belongs to “the consequences are particularly serious”, and the benchmark punishment is more than five years. Based on the above provisions, in this case, Han Bing caused an economic loss of 180000 yuan and deleted the data as high as 9t, which obviously belongs to “the consequences are particularly serious”. He was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment, which is in line with the provisions of the criminal law.\n\nIn addition, whether the perpetrator has the circumstances of voluntary surrender and confession, and whether he pleads guilty or not will affect the final sentencing of the court. The defendant Han Bing refused to admit after deleting 9TB data of the company, and did not cooperate to provide computer and mobile phone passwords. Although the company spent 180000 yuan to repair the data, the circumstances were serious and finally sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment.\n\nIt has reflected the problems of the financial system several times, but it has not been paid attention to\n\nIn Han Bing’s testimony, the reason for deleting the database was not reflected. However, according to media reports, according to his colleagues, Han Bing found that there were security problems in the company’s financial system during his tenure, and sent an email to Zhang, another database administrator of the chain home. He reported the security problems of the financial system to several leaders twice and suggested that the company start a security project to repair the security problems, but it was not paid attention to.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Department of the financial line was assigned to the information line. They reported the security problems of the financial system to Zhou Xiaolong, the leader of the information line, and suggested to start a security project for repair, but it was still not adopted, and even had a dispute with Zhou Xiaolong in the process of making suggestions.\n\nAs for the phenomenon that other relevant persons involved ignored the potential safety hazards or did not act, lawyer Xia Hailong said that although there was no connection between the disregard and omission of other personnel of the company to the system risk and the crime committed by the defendant in this case, there was no instigation or assistance, and they did not have to bear criminal responsibility, but other personnel, such as the leaders of the above information line The director of the professional ethics construction center does not pay attention to the hidden danger of data security, and is also likely to violate the company’s internal management regulations or labor contract, so he needs to be liable for compensation to the company for relevant losses.\n\nHowever, for the criminal act committed by Han Bing himself, the defendant in this case, Lianjia company believes that the slowdown before his engagement and the lack of cooperation with the investigation afterwards are the culprits causing the final loss of the company. The director of the professional ethics construction center of Lianjia company also mentioned in his testimony that Han Bing came to the company in February 2018 to be responsible for the maintenance of the financial system, was transferred to the technical support department in May, and the workplace also changed. Han Bing has a problem with the organizational adjustment and feels that he is not taken seriously. After the adjustment, he slows down. After checking the company’s surveillance video, Han Bing often arrives late and leaves early, and is also absent from work.\n\nIn recent years, there have been frequent database deletion incidents in which employees retaliate against the company. How to maintain system security and compliance in the work involving enterprise information security and confidentiality has become particularly important. Lawyer Xia Hailong told reporters 21 that the company should take more effective technical means to strengthen the security protection of internal information system and data, disperse the authority of core system, increase the verification level, formulate a more standardized system security system, fill management loopholes, and avoid database deletion events caused by employees’ personal reasons to the greatest extent.\n\nThe discretion and judgment at the legal level are becoming increasingly clear and justified. “For whatever reason, employees’ unauthorized deletion of the company’s information and data is a serious violation of the company’s internal management system and will objectively cause losses to the company. Therefore, they will face the risk of termination of labor relations and compensation for losses", "timestamp": 1653253985, "digest": "J1vX8TO2pWPJQjOWPyHTo-ykUhSeXPamQwSNgxzIjXs", "contributor": "0x79aACBC0E746C1bc8e9849612b655Ed47414E45E"}
{"id": "TWg1L9rssF8EHuoFv-I-s8o5umjkeq2rYNqjzxWiTzI", "title": "My favourite game", "body": "I am a child of the 80’s. Born in ’73, my conscious mind really started to take shape in the years defined by E.T, Ghostbusters, Back to the Future and Star Wars…, Nintendo Hardware games (Orange Donkey Kong fold up…;), Big Tall Stereo towers, LP records, Neon Colors and my favorite game at that time… “ONDERUIT”. The game (called “Downfall” in English) is a strategic turn by turn game like Zeeslag (“Battleship”) or Vier op een Rij (“four in a row”), but it had something different to the rest. The gears that you would turn would influence the game of your opponent. I absolutely loved that. The objective of the game would be to unload your two times 5 Tokens that would feed in at the top. By turning the gears, the Tokens would fall into the special token spaces available in each of the 5 gears. You could move the tokens down to the catch reservoir at the bottom. Whoever did that the quickest way would win. I used to play this game a lot with my dad and my sister and had one strategy. I would always try to load up the final gear (which had space for 5 tokens) and prepare my turn to have maximum effect by dropping 5 Tokens in the reservoir at once… freaking out my competition…. In this case usually my sister.\n\n![ONDERUIT / DOWNFALL](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bOryJqsRX1PNFhCFS8cX6.png?height=220&width=426)\n\nOver the years, my 80’s influenced interests and average high school performance lead me to the doors of the university of Technology in Delft. A pretty overwhelming place for someone who actually just wanted to go to art school, but a place I look back to with much appreciation and gratitude for having the patients with a slow burner like myself.In Delft I learned to design industrial products and services. During my 12,5-year stay (at the time students could pretty much study forever) I learned to control my chaotic creative mind, using the abstract academic frameworks and pathways offered by the faculty of Industrial Design engineering. It took me some time to realize that the PROCESS of DESIGN was actually helping me to give order to my creative mind. Learning to see the difference between ideas, concepts and iterative prototypes and creating options as apposed to single minded focus on one idea, was one of the biggest lessons I took away from that place.\n\nWhen I started my first solo design company called “RIPPLE” (domain for sale by the way), I started to see the benefits of being able to create order and optionality in a world of entrepreneurial chaos, using frames or guidelines that would show an accountable path towards a desired end goal. This ended up literally becoming what I am still doing for clients today. [But that is another story](https://www.visuallyyours.nl).\n\nIt was after some time into my studies, doing assignments and miscellaneous design work for others, that I started to realize that I had developed a pattern of working. My own take on the Delft process of Design. Not a particular good pattern, but one that was similar to my one strategy in the “ONDERUIT” game I shared so enthusiastically at the start of this post.\n\nBefore I sat down with a client (or fellow students / professors) I would prepare a whole lot of work overwhelming them with a wall of visuals. Something that looked good and combined our shared perspectives. A story that felt like a credible well thought out direction that was ready to go and be successful. There are all kinds of things you can say about working like that, but for the purpose of this post the moment of sharing a lot of (visual) work is key. The moment I would share my in-between progress would feel exactly like dropping the 5 tokens in the reservoir! My 80’s game strategy when playing that kick-ass two person battle game, ended up becoming my preferred way of working whenever I would share my designs with others.\n\nSo now …you might be wondering why I would share this somewhat strange and bizarrely personal revelation with you in a random online post. The stories I am putting together on Mirror.xyz/DENACE.eth are part of a bigger picture that has to do with my own personal way of trying to connect with what I think could be the future of collaboration and personal identity…Web3. But am I ready for what it has to offer? Are my present capabilities ready for the future?\n\nThe virtual space we have come to know as the internet has been gaining speed. Both in its technical development and its cultural application. This means that the newer protocols, codes/algorithms and the attention on Artificial Intelligence are kind of forcing me to reevaluate the way I operate. Is the way that I design, the way I interact with others, the way online collaboration across the globe is enabling so many people to work and create so many amazing new things together, is that way compatible with my one strategy….my personal design framework?\n\nWhat this new space is doing for me now is kind of forcing me to test & challenge my old modus operandi. Does my visual abundance strategy, my desire to overwhelm people with visual work, does it still have a future in Web3?\n\nWhat I am seeing in my daily design doings is that the new iterations in our shared online space, are just too big to get our heads around. For designers and for our clients alike the promises of new relationships with ownership, responsibility & privacy might give you new reasons to worry, instead of opportunities to take advantage of. In order to understand what is changing and from what angles you can approach the Web3 potential, people will  need guidance or curated pathways to start and understand what the current changes in the landscape might mean for you.\n\nBecause it is happening in so many spaces at once, with so many people trying to create ways for you to connect to why it is important, it is a challenge to understand and see how the future of the internet is relevant to you.\n\nThese posts on Mirror & Medium will be my quest going forward in the development of small stories, that can show the way. My explorations will try to overwhelm you with a combination of writing and visualization, making it easier to relate to some of the main themes in Web3, like ownership, privacy, trust and collaboration.\n\nMy choice for Mirror as a platform lies entirely with Joshua Nuttall, with whom I am sharing the Perpetual Inquiry Journey. Since the beginning of 2021 I have been collaborating with Joshua Nuttall ([josh.mirror.xyz](https://josh.mirror.xyz/)) on a variety of projects in several Thinking domains.

Or the grey business of \"internal and external collusion\"", "body": "The third-party platform charges and recommends interns in the financial industry, which has caused a storm. Many institutions have denied the behavior of “charging internal promotion”\n\n“Tens of thousands of yuan to buy internships in financial institutions” is a scam\n\nAt the peak of College Students’ summer internship, a third-party platform “clearly priced” was sold to the “disclosure” of internship opportunities in financial institutions, which caused an uproar in the financial circle and college students. In this regard, a number of financial institutions have issued statements denying any form of “fee push” behavior. Some people in the financial industry pointed out that the behavior of “fee pushing” is likely to be a private transaction between internal employees of financial institutions and external third-party institutions.\n\nInternships in well-known financial institutions are the dream of many college graduates. If someone charges you 35000 yuan to recommend internship opportunities for you, will you pay? A few days ago, a microblog revealed that some third-party platforms carried out “fee push” business, which caused an uproar in the financial circle and college students. A number of financial institutions have issued official statements, saying that there is no “fee push” in any form, reminding everyone to apply through formal channels such as the official website. Many people in the financial circle also told the reporter of Beijing Youth Daily that regular financial institutions will not recruit fee interns, and the majority of students should beware of being cheated.\n\nBreak the news\n\nPay 50000 yuan to practice in investment banking companies\n\nThe so-called internal push is internal recommendation. When recruiting interns or regular employees, many enterprises are willing to let people inside the company recommend them. This practice can improve the recruitment efficiency, which is equivalent to adding a layer of interpersonal endorsement in addition to the normal examination and investigation. Some financial institutions also encourage internal employees to recommend talents for the company, and even reward the successful referrals. Originally, the recruitment information of these enterprises was completely open and the recruitment process was all free, but some platforms saw “business opportunities” to start the business of charging and pushing.\n\nAccording to the information exposed on Weibo, some training institutions taking “financial partners” as an example are actually selling internship opportunities for financial institutions in the name of job guidance for interns, involving many financial institutions, including some well-known banks and securities companies.\n\nBeiqing Daily reporter found that most large-scale platforms do not directly price internship opportunities, but are keen to launch expensive training packages.\n\nIn the “breaking news” of Weibo, a screenshot of an article from the “financial partner” official account shows that the training institution provides four different levels of packages with different charging standards, including courses and practical training (four weeks offline + two weeks offline), with a quotation of 11800 yuan; Online elite apprenticeship package (online training + 1-to-1 remote internship, recommendation letter can be provided), with a quotation of 15800 yuan. There are also exclusive packages and Xingyao packages requiring private letter inquiry, including courses and training + unlimited internships + two-year VIP + school recruitment VIP, etc.\n\nOn another platform called “disciple job search”, the reporter of Beiqing daily found that it launched the disciple plan of “ensuring to obtain internship 0ffer (employment)”, claiming that this plan is a “carefully built high-end private customized” project. This project aims at job matching for resumes, targeting target positions, whether remote, on-site, formal or full-time, and all positions in investment banks, public funds and foreign investment consulting. It also claims “accidental failure, full refund” in an “atmosphere”. As for the price, it is a single post, single pricing, and the price varies. A person who has contacted the job consultant of the platform disclosed that the quotation of the platform for different companies and positions ranges from 20000 to 60000 yuan.\n\nThe reporter of Beiqing daily also found that a few platforms that mainly promote through wechat even play the push price directly on the leaflet. For example, in a third-party organization’s “fee push” standard circulated on the Internet, investment banks, consulting, accounting firms, banks, FMCG and the Internet in the financial industry are covered. The companies cited include state-owned banks, four major accounting firms, well-known securities companies, Chinese funded and foreign-funded enterprises. The internship opportunities of FMCG and Internet companies with the lowest price are 19800 yuan, while the internship opportunities of investment banking companies need up to 52800 yuan.\n\ninvestigation\n\nAt least more than a dozen platforms engaged in “charging internal promotion”\n\nAccording to the incomplete statistics of the reporter of Beiqing daily, there are at least more than ten third-party institutions with some fame and scale engaged in similar internal push internship charging business.\n\nNetizens who have worked on similar platforms broke the news that these charging platforms are mainly for college students with internship and employment needs, and all provide various paid services and packages with clearly marked prices. The service content is also diverse, fully covering the full range of needs of job seekers. For example, basic training such as modifying resumes, delivering resumes, online interview skills training and career planning consulting are generally cheaper. The most attractive is the plan that can push inward and even guarantee offer. Generally, the charge is 5 digits.\n\nThese platforms will “viral” share the circle of friends, pull target customers into the group, and then send some articles and information in the group every day to attract everyone to buy services. The modification of resume is generally 100-400 yuan, and the help of professional HR (Human Resource Management) is 500-1000 yuan. Targeted internship posts are priced according to different situations. Ordinary securities companies are priced at 10000-20000 yuan. The higher the reputation, the higher the price. For example, a Chinese prefix securities company pushes a price of 45000 yuan, and those with good performance have room for retention; The internship position of the top investment bank in China is 60000 yuan, and the internship is guaranteed for 3 months.\n\nclarify\n\nMany financial institutions say it has nothing to do with the charging platform\n\nAfter microblogging exposed the industry chaos of “fee push” internship, many financial institutions issued public statements saying they had no cooperative relationship with these platforms.\n\nUBS group said in a statement that it has no cooperative relationship with any training unit, group or individual to internally recommend resumes, and has never edited, published or released any recruitment examination reference materials. UBS careers official website is the only official recruitment channel of the group in mainland China. Applicants who are interested in applying for UBS group apply for positions through official channels to guard against fraud. UBS Group reserves the right to investigate the legal liability of the publisher of false information.\n\nHuatai Securities also stated, “Huatai Securities recruitment official website is the only official channel for campus recruitment resumes.

Stephen Smith of “American Yang Yi” also angrily criticized 76 people.\n\nHe believes that the 76 people have no fighting spirit today, represented by nbid.\n\n“It’s the worst 76ers game I’ve seen in a long time,” Smith said. “There’s no fighting spirit, from the beginning to the end. It seems that they feel they’re still waiting for Game 6.”\n\nNbid scored only 17 points. Although he may have been affected by the injury, others have no excuse. A team without fighting spirit can’t beat the heat.\n\nAfter losing Tianwang mountain, the 76ers fell behind 2-3. Losing another game means being out. Their best result is to win the G6 and then go to Miami to compete with the heat. But if it’s today’s fighting spirit, they won’t have a chance to go to Miami at all.

It’s not a good feeling. We didn’t play well. We have to understand the requirements of the game. We need more ball rights in the other half. It’s difficult for the players to understand the concept of free man. We lack the simplicity required. But the team is efficient and we’re still fighting for second place.”\n\n“We have some important players missing, such as pique, pedry and Busquets, which affects the team. Nevertheless, we must play easily and more succinctly. Don’t lose so many goals.”\n\nHarvey praised demberle, who scored twice in assists: “sometimes he plays a decisive role, not only in scoring goals, but also in creating goals. Demberle almost helps the team rewrite the score to 1-0 by himself. In football, not only scoring goals, his assists can also play a decisive role.”\n\nFor Araujo, who suffered a concussion during the game, Harvey said that the players were kept in the hospital for observation overnight, but it was OK.\n\nOn the news that Manchester City signed Harland, Harvey said: “that’s what I said yesterday.

It’s about accountability, and taking responsibility for things we can control and understanding where we are vulnerable. Every discord we build should be built in mind with each and every single user being subject to compromise. Therefore, we have a PLAN in place BEFORE the attack, and do everything we can to mitigate and sometimes null the attack (before it takes place). But there is one role that must NEVER be compromised, and we can lock it down before the discord is open to the public.\n\n## Discord Creator/Founder Role\n\n![The discord creator/founder role is identified by the CROWN.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9pNu0CAI42af7dO2yqzFv.png?height=67&width=284)\n\nThe account that creates the discord should NEVER be an active USER in the server (once it is open) or even active anywhere outside of the server. It is OK if you use an active account to create the discord, but BEFORE going public, this role should be transferred to a burner account (preferably brand new account with email and discord name unassociated with the server/unrecognizable). This account is NOT used for anything else, other than being a ‘hardware wallet/ledger’ for the server. \n \n\n![This role can be transferred to ANYONE, but only by the user with the role. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z-qwDiAGit7tqsl0bucQR.png?height=126&width=184)\n\n \n No matter what the permissions and roles are in a server, no matter the hierarchy of those roles, the **FOUNDER/CREATOR** account bypasses all restrictions and has absolute control over the entire server and every role within it. The good news is, we can completely eliminate this attack vector and keep it in cold storage, unmarked and hidden away on the server. This account doesn’t need any special roles or identifiable markings and we in fact recommend keeping it that way. \n  \n Users may be able to use tools to figure it out, or discord itself may do a poor job of hiding it, but we do NOT need to bring any extra attention to this role, nor do we need to put it at risk by using it on an active account. With the account taken out of play and not in use, there is no chance of anyone phishing or gaining access to this account. Furthermore if an Admin is compromised, we always have one role above it, hidden and ready to ‘break in case of emergency’ and regain control of the server/eradicate the threat. If this role is ever compromised in this way, we know the attack came from within and limit it to only the person who had access to it being responsible.\n\n## Roles, Permissions, & Hierarchy\n\nThe next most vulnerable area of attack is ANYONE with administrator permissions in the server (humans and bots). Administrator permissions bypass ALL roles and restrictions within the discord and channels HOWEVER they still cannot change or alter the roles at or above them. This hierarchy of roles can be used to our advantage when structuring discord roles and permissions.\n\n![Subject to change, missing verification bot.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/F6xf2NACQwCapIOCRrmR6.png?height=674&width=677)\n\nUnderstanding ADMIN access is vulnerable to attack, we place the ONLY human role with admin at the very TOP (+) role and we only grant it to few individuals who need it. I recommend 2-3 at max, depending on the size of the server. I furthermore recommend that those working in this position understand they are NOT allowed to use these accounts to degen into other servers or operate on them for anything else other than doing their administrator work in the discords they are working on. It’s a lot of responsibility, it’s a job and should be treated as such. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TeYlyd392eMzpwYNbSLy-.png?height=246&width=218)\n\n \n Notice this role is neither hoisted, nor visible on the sidebar, nor is it colored and meant to stand out. The vanity roles which mark and signify Admin, Mod, and Team do NOT have Admin access and they are restricted only to the channels they need for their job.  \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_S9lbFudcm3_Jefh3uOHG.gif?height=442&width=536)\n\nThese roles have an identifiable color and mark, sometimes with emoji icons and hoisted above all other roles. We expect these roles to be targeted and plan for them to be compromised. Therefore we plan ahead of time to mitigate the damage anyone can do with these roles with this structure and limitation of perms. Again, the only true Admins of the server have the (+) role and no ONE can give them this role, except for the founder/creator role which is on ice and locked away. And those with this + role take on extra responsibility and limit their attack vectors and exposure. \n  \n After administrator permissions (which again bypasses all restrictions, except hierarchy of roles) the next biggest threat is who has access to INFORMATION channels, with the biggest targets being on #Announcements & #Official Links channels. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jy5bYbeigGGeeMs8WA7bo.png?height=842&width=1013)\n\nThe standard setup takes away everyone’s ability to write in this channel except for the intended user/role which overrides the nulled send message permission. Again Administrators still have absolute access and bypass all restrictions.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ztSxAiQQQn49fEfMnAgYX.png?height=850&width=1006)\n\nTherefore we NEVER grant anyone *permanent* control of these channels and limit their access with the (++) role. Only the true administrator (+) role has permanent access (as admin negates these restrictions) and only the (+) role can grant access.  \n  \n It is therefore recommend that his exchange of power and communication for it be done (off and away from discord). Either through the use of text, whatsapp, or other platforms. This way even if a users discord account is compromised, the attackers do NOT have a means to ask for access to these permissions (other than discord channels and DMs, which we will NEVER use to ask for these permissions).  \n  \n Now attackers need full use to an admins device (phone or computer) to entirely compromise them. These attackers are not doing this yet, but as we up our security they may which means we will need more security and practices outside of discord.\n\n## Trusted Bots\n\nAfter removing the attack vector from the Creator/Founder account, limiting attack vectors to only trusted admin (+) role, our last area of exposure are the bots we use and the permissions we grant them. For projects of larger scale, I highly recommend fully-custom built, in-house bots to limit exposure and responsibility. As much as we dislike Azuki’s founder, I do applaud their server for having no compromises as all their bots are custom built. They remain a high target and have completely avoided compromise, this is worth noting and paying attention to regardless of feelings towards Zagabond or their project. \n  \n Not everyone can afford this option, but for any project that is bringing in hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars, there is no excuse. The only other options are to completely remove all bots from the server (which takes away logs and much welcomed automation), or to have very limited bots in the server strictly permed for their roles, and having the structure setup in a way to prepare for their compromise.\n\n![This build is currently missing a verification gate, I believe I'd place it here - but this is subject to change. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/44gE4YUgygYuvzZohaJEM.png?height=426&width=678)\n\nAs it currently stands I have WICK above all other bots, with the quarantine role above them, but below Wick. This way we can rely on Wick to quarantine and remove all threats (including any of these bots being compromised). The problem with this build is that we are putting A LOT of faith in wick not being compromised. However, Wick is a PAID service and built with security in mind. Even if a user granted themselves a permission in this server, they wouldn’t be able to access and change the wick dashboard settings unless the server owner gave them access (which again, this account is locked away on cold storage).  \n  \n When a Mee6 employee was compromised, and they were able to bypass server settings and change permissions and roles, the one server with Wick operating as intended (PXN) was able to instantly & automatically remove any webhooks and posts in their announcement channel. This was because the user was NOT whitelisted to post on the backend/dashboard of Wick. Even though an admin was compromised, Wick still didn’t allow that admin to post. Again it still puts a lot of faith in Wick and if you operate a large-scale project, I recommend you make your own.\n\n## In Conclusion\n\nServer Creator/Founder should be kept on ice and taken out of play. Humans with Admin access and perms above all other roles should be very limited and ready to take full responsibility and accountability for their role. It should be a paid job and those in that position should understand how to properly build and manage a discord. \n  \n BOTs in the server should be very limited in permissions and channels for only their needed purpose and those that aren’t we should understand fully how much faith and trust we are granting in them (as much as an ADMIN) if they have administrator access. Depending on the size and scale of your business, understand what that means. \n  \n There are discords that have NEVER been compromised, or if compromised, had minimal damage (threats instantly eradicated). We should all understand why that was and open-source our security as much as possible to team up against these threats. Understand this does NOT replace a much needed job and position within this space as we can give someone the keys to a helicopter and they still cannot fly it, or the schematics to a building and not everyone can build it.", "timestamp": 1653255674, "digest": "KYe8hFL2h-zwuDbIMOBxjPSVooAeUkTcWa_UAkhu5aE", "contributor": "0x2f14fBa7f3b90DAA8DE0f35DfE0c6859cBB0034a"}

{"id": "keRusc3jYc5mpn0J_tpImkIfcFUjWuPhpDZSm9JSP0c", "title": "Smelling tumor? Zhejiang University research results crack the root cause of glioma", "body": "Beijing, Hangzhou, May 12 (Xie Panpan, Ke Yineng) how do tumors occur? It has always been a difficult problem for scientists. Zhejiang University has proved for the first time that there is a unique direct link between olfactory perception experience and glioma through a clear chain of evidence.\n\nThis achievement was published in the international top journal Nature on May 11, Beijing time. The first author of the paper is Chen Pengxiang, a doctoral student of the school of medicine of Zhejiang University, and the corresponding author is Liu Chong, a researcher of Liangzhu laboratory and a dual professor of the second College of Zhejiang University.\n\nGliomas with discoloration are the most common malignant primary intracranial tumors. The annual incidence rate is about 3-8 people /100000 people. The median survival time of patients is only 15 months from the discovery of disease to death. Patients need to receive multimodal treatment such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, immunotherapy and so on. At present, it is believed that the etiology of glioma is caused by the interaction between congenital genetic high-risk factors and carcinogenic factors in the acquired environment. However, it has not been determined how environmental stimuli are associated with disease.\n\nIn more than ten years of research, Liu Chong has been thinking about what factors can induce glioma?\n\n“The growth of tumor cells will communicate and transmit information with surrounding cells. Neurons are the basic functional unit of the brain and function through nerve discharge. Therefore, we focus on neuronal activity to explore whether it will affect the production of glioma.” Liu Chong introduced.\n\nTo uncover the relationship between environmental stimuli and glioma production, the first challenge is to build an experimental mouse model that can spontaneously produce glioma. Because the tumor is produced spontaneously rather than transplanted, it can really reflect the process of tumor formation in the brain.\n\nFacing this challenge, Liu Chong’s laboratory took several years to build a reliable animal model to simulate the generation process of glioma in human brain. Through rigorous analysis, the team found that the tumor mainly spontaneously occurred in the synaptic bulb layer of the olfactory bulb, that is, the information exchange area of the first level neurons (olfactory sensory neurons) and the second level neurons (called monk hat / cluster cells) of the olfactory loop.\n\n“Since the olfactory brain area is the prone site of gliomas, will the neuronal activity of the olfactory circuit affect the occurrence of gliomas?” This sudden “brain hole” has become the key of the whole research. Liu Chong’s team then further verified this conjecture.\n\nZhejiang University research team used cutting-edge chemical genetic interventions to accurately inhibit the activity of olfactory neurons in mice. The researchers found that after inhibiting the activity of olfactory sensory neurons, the tumor volume decreased significantly; After activating its activity, the tumor volume increased. The results showed that the excitatory activity of olfactory loop neurons was the root of glioma.\n\nIn order to verify the above conclusions, the team of Zhejiang University further blocked the unilateral olfactory input of mice through accurate physical blocking. After directly blocking the unilateral olfactory input of mice, the researchers found that the volume of tumors in the olfactory bulb of the blocked side brain decreased, which fully proved that olfactory stimulation can regulate the occurrence of gliomas.\n\n“This study is the first to intervene in spontaneous glioma formation by physical means, and also verifies the role of olfactory neural circuit in glioma formation.” Liu Chong said.\n\nAfter clarifying the olfactory neural circuit that induces glioma, the next step is to trace back to the source and find out what is the mechanism behind it?\n\nThrough in-depth analysis, Liu Chong’s team screened out that growth factor IGF-1 is a potentially important effector, and IGF-1 in the olfactory bulb is mainly expressed in the second-order neurons of the olfactory loop, monk cap / cluster cells. Based on the above findings, the researchers constructed a new mouse model, which can simultaneously simulate the occurrence of glioma and remove IGF-1 specifically derived from monk hat / cluster cells. The results showed that after knockout of IGF-1 in monk hat / cluster cells, the tumor volume decreased significantly. Subsequently, the team activated olfactory sensory neurons and blocked IGF-1 signaling pathway on this mouse tumor model, and found that the tumor promoting effect caused by olfactory activation was completely eliminated. It is clearly proved that olfactory activity mainly regulates the occurrence of glioma through IGF-1 signaling pathway.\n\nLiu Chong said, “in the whole glioma occurrence loop, the monk hat / cluster cells in the olfactory loop are stimulated by olfaction to secrete growth factor IGF-1, which is equivalent to the growth signal sent by the radio wave transmitting tower. This signal is received by the growth factor receptor on the tumor cell, which is like the radio wave is received by the antenna, and then transmitted to the tumor cell to start the process of cell malignant transformation and proliferation.”\n\nOver the years, based on the long-term cooperation with the neurosurgery department of the second hospital of Zhejiang University, Liu Chong laboratory has been paying attention to the research and development of the origin of nervous system tumor cells, tumor evolution mechanism and personalized treatment strategy. The publication of the latest results reveals that external sensation (olfactory stimulation) can directly affect the occurrence of glioma from a new perspective.\n\nLiu Chong said that this achievement provides unlimited thinking space for the follow-up to further explore whether different sensory stimuli (such as vision, hearing, taste, touch, etc.), even emotional stress and abnormal neurological function related diseases will also affect the occurrence of tumors. The in-depth exploration based on this research can help people better understand the basic biological problem of the essence of tumorigenesis, and provide a new direction for the prevention, early intervention and treatment of glioma.

DAO如果想实现（有代币门槛的）“一人一票”投票机制，往往得依赖web2的基础设施，如社交媒体个人资料，来对抗女巫攻击（用程序生成大量机器人模拟真人行为）。\n3. Web3建设者在各个DAO建设中都做出了贡献，但这种贡献却无法直接与其链上的身份绑定，导致其在求职时可能依然需要走Web2的简历填写等流程。\n4. 一些NFT项目声称自己是由某知名艺术家创作的，但这种创作无法在链上得到直接验证。用户只有通过Web2社交媒体联系艺术家来验证真伪，若无法联系或得不到及时澄清，容易上当受骗。\n\n因此，Web3原生身份组件的构建，对于Web3的进一步繁荣发展是至关重要的。行业内一般称这类身份组件为去中心化身份（DID）。\n\n## 二、DID的枢纽位置与应用场景\n\nAmber Group，全球顶级的crypto金融服务商，于2021年11月勾勒了DID的生态系统，详见下图：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6jTUS1eIVJbuF1MJfmExt.png?height=1470&width=1430)\n\n在这幅图中，DID位于Layer3，处于整个生态的枢纽位置。\n\n在DID的上游，是Layer1-共识标准层和Layer2-基础设施：\n\n* 共识标准层可以简单理解为对Web3身份表示的各种标准规范的制定，目前主要参与方是为W3C（万维网联盟）和DIF（去中心化身份基金会）\n* 基础设施层中，最值得关注的是.bit、ENS等域名项目 —— 由于域名可以绑定地址、地址本身难以记忆，未来Web3世界中每个人的“姓名”很可能会以域名的形式进行展示。\n\n在DID的下游，是众多依赖于DID的应用项目。个人认为，当前对DID最为迫切的三类应用项目，是不完全抵押借贷、DAO治理工具、Web3社交：\n\n* 不完全抵押借贷曾是Defi中的一大探索方向，曾经也有Goldfinch等有一定影响力的项目，但它们并不成功，TVL接近归0；但是，如果有了身份约束、甚至链下真人的唯一性认证，用户就不得不考虑到违约所要付出的信用成本，这和真实世界借贷相类似。\n* 在DAO治理投票、包括项目对早期用户贡献的衡量中，如何识别哪些用户为真人、哪些是机器人一直是一大难题。当DID成熟之后，DAO治理也将会走向新的高度。\n* Web3原生的社交项目目前并没有非常成功的，其中的一个因素就是缺少现实真人在链上的实体映射：每个用户可能有多个地址，且地址之间的交易局限于金融行为而缺少社交行为。DID的出现将为Web3社交项目的发展提供新思路。\n\n值得注意的是，由于DID目前的成熟形态尚不清晰，不少DID项目的分类在不同的地方也不一样，这个问题也将会在后文进行探讨。有时候一些本属于socialfi、defi类的赛道也会被归为DID赛道的项目，对此我们不必纠结。\n\n下面，让我们来看看当前的DID项目是如何做出解决上述问题的尝试的。\n\n## 三、DID项目的大致划分及其代表方案\n\n上文提到，Web3中不同的应用场景都对DID提出了需求。对于不同需求的侧重，当前的DID项目可以大致划分为四类：链下身份认证类、链上身份聚合类、链上信用评分类、链上行为认证类。\n\n### 3.1 链下身份认证\n\n将链下的真人身份信息与链上地址绑定，是一个看似有吸引力的解决Web3身份问题的方案：\n\n假设一个人毕业于斯坦福大学，曾在谷歌当工程师，在硅谷有两套房产。如果上述信息能够得到认证而与这个人持有的一个地址绑定，那么这些链下的荣誉和财产也将为他在链上的社交、借贷等各种活动提供加持 —— 比如他想认识斯坦福的校友，抑或是他希望进行一些抵押率相对较低的借贷。\n\n然而，现阶段如果想要做信息层面的绑定验证，是相当困难的。这其中最关键的原因，在于这些链下行为无法在链上得到验证，从而使得其审核依赖于中心化机构。比如想实现一个简单的工作单位认证，都需要这些工作单位配合上链进行审核操作，考虑到当前Web3的大众普及率和上手门槛，这对于项目的推广是相当困难的；更进一步的，如果要做工作中的项目经历认证，更是为审查困难、串谋作弊提供了可能 —— 毕竟这些东西都不在链上。\n\n因此，希望挑战链下信息验证的项目寥寥无几。在A16Z去年11月的文章中，提到Violet项目在做这方面的尝试，不过其官网仍没有其具体方案的展示。\n\n既然如此，现在涉及到链下身份的DID项目，更多的侧重于“唯一真人身份绑定”。这还是有比较成熟的技术方案的，那就是视频人脸识别。\n\nBrightID是真人身份验证的代表性项目，目前其已有超过5.7万名用户。用户需要预约zoom视频会议，通过人脸识别和验证官的复核来做BrightID的唯一身份认证；如果用户之前已经做过认证，就无法再创建新的账号，只能申请身份恢复。\n\n![BrightID APP的主界面](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tfMryU5b5vi4aIqiypfsv.png?height=1926&width=3292)\n\n![BrightID通过Zoom视频会议进行唯一性认证](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J-8sX-xRcUaJx6qGr2mBg.png?height=1922&width=3638)\n\nBrightID的当前主要应用场景，来自部分项目方开展项目时的“一人一号”需求，如比如经过BrightID认证后才能领空投。目前Gitcoin、RabbitHole、Status 等多个项目都已经采用BrightID。\n\n除了BrightID以外，Verite也是个值得关注的身份标准。它由UDSC的发行方Circle公司于5月10日推出，其中KYC是其身份验证的关键之一，具体KYC的形式和产品的设计有待项目方进一步披露。不过个人认为，视频人脸认证是比要提供护照、身份证等进一步真人隐私信息等KYC更合适的方案。\n\n### 3.2 链上身份聚合\n\n这类的DID项目并没有关注用户线下的情况，而是通过“数字身份”这一概念，来实现用户的链上信息的聚合管理，甚至进而成为用户在web3世界的入口。\n\n这里面隐含着一个深层次的假设：Web3应用的服务对象应该是“数字人”而非真人，每位现实世界中的用户可以选择在Web3中构建多个数字身份。当然，每个人的时间精力总是有限的，因此这些数字身份总有主次、领域侧重之分，但这没有关系。如果用户要凭借一个成熟的数字身份做出违约、欺诈等行为，这意味着他可能会失去之前构建这个数字身份所做的一切努力。\n\nUnipass是这类项目的代表之一，它做的事情正是链上身份的聚合管理：通过一个Unipass ID，用户可以绑定邮箱、多个ETH地址，并且还搭建了社交图谱（CyberConnect）、信息聚合平台（RSS3）等应用层协议。通过这种不断的聚合和对应用层的整合、屏蔽，之后Unipass甚至可能成为用户在Web3入口，变成用户在Web3的“One Pass”。\n\n![Unipass APP主界面](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EMDIjmTqxg-pnPn5bUVkf.png?height=1952&width=3162)\n\n可以看出，Unipass是一个野心很大的项目，它的终极目标其实是取代钱包在当前Web3的生态位 —— 但其方案必然会与钱包项目起冲突，不少应用项目恐怕也不希望被“协议化”而失去流量入口。从更高的视角来看，对Web3的入口的竞争无疑是相当激烈的，未来Metamask等钱包项目很可能也会朝着链上身份聚合这个方向发展。\n\n> 关于Unipass的更多展望，可以参考Nervos Network对Unipass项目方的访谈：[A Conversation with UniPass: Your Free Web3 Account](https://medium.com/@nervosnetwork/a-conversation-with-unipass-your-free-web3-account-ce5ed52f73bc)\n\n另一类值得关注的项目以Spruce为代表。Spruce想做的事情简单来说，就是构建一个跨平台、跨公链的身份认证系统。比如，用户可以基于 SpruceID 的认证插件使用以太坊账户，直接登录 discord，不用二次信息验证。\n\n可以看出，Spruce的身份认证，更多体现在Web3公链地址与Web2各平台账号的互通与融合上。与Web2现有平台账号的绑定，对于一些已经在Web2中有一定成就和影响力的人而言，无疑是一个很不错身份增强方案 —— 例如一个几百万粉丝的Twitter大V，其去做借贷的时候很可能可以得到更优惠的抵押率和利率。\n\n![流程图： oidc.login.xyz 服务器如何帮助Spruce进行身份验证](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jMZLq-VoQChQYCsnri0OS.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nSpruce于2022年4月20日完成A轮3400万美元融资，由A16Z领投。由于Spruce的实现涉及到许多技术挑战，其应用目前尚未上线，不过项目方会在官方不时披露其开发进度。\n\n### 3.3 链上信用评分\n\n这类项目的初心非常直接 —— 拓展Defi借贷的场景，把现实世界中金融行业的信用机制在Web3中找到某种实现，以提高Defi的资源配置效率。\n\nARCx可以看做此类项目的一个代表。它于2022年5月13日完成新一轮融资，由 Dragonfly Capital、Scalar Capital 和 Ledger Prime 领投。\n\nARCx通过发行「DeFi Passport」，根据每个 DeFi Passport 持有者的信用分来量化其链上地址的信誉度。信用分将通过分析持有者的以太坊地址历史活动来确定，其范围设置为 0 到 999 分，该信用分确定了协议为用户提供的抵押率。对于信用分高的地址而言，DeFi Passport 能够提供有竞争力的借贷抵押。\n\n![ARCx官网截图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KrgqTjMZzL0ult0FkuoO9.png?height=1246&width=1360)\n\n可以看出，相比于前两类DID项目，链上信用评分类项目更聚焦于用户的“数字金融身份”，使用的也多是用户的链上交易数据而非其社交行为数据，这使得其很难朝完整的DID项目发展。但鉴于金融活动在Web3当前的重要地位，信用评分类项目也将会是完整DID生态中不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### 3.4 链上行为认证\n\n如果说前三类项目都聚焦于对用户的身份状态作出静态的整理与评估，那么最后一类项目就显得比较特殊了 —— 它是对用户的身份状态作出动态的更新。这类项目的核心逻辑是，引导用户参与某些合作方要求的活动、行为，并对其颁发链上的认证。\n\n显然的，这类项目本身并没有给用户一个DID，更多的是对用户现有DID的不断补充。这类项目在DID的生态中也占有很重要的地位 —— 毕竟某种意义上，是它们定义了什么是“\n数字身份”的组成部分。\n\nProject Galaxy是这个方向的明星项目，其代币于2022年5月4日在Binance上线。Project Galaxy也被称为“数据凭证网络”，这里的“凭证”，就是为行为认证的具体表达。\n\n> 用户连接钱包后即可生成一张“银河身份证”，证件上会根据地址的历史行为，自动贴上「认证证书」，比如「Uniswap 交易员」、「OpenSea 交易员」等等。这些凭证如同现实世界的各种职业资格证一般，在某些特定场景会发挥价值。\n\nProject Galaxy最大的应用场景，就是帮助项目方利用凭证数据来构建更好的产品和社区，成为连接项目方和用户的平台。比如项目方希望用户进行某种链上活动后才能获取空投资格，Project Galaxy就可以帮助项目方识别这种链上活动并颁发凭证，既方便项目方的空投管理，也赋予了用户更多的价值感。\n\n![项目方把活动任务挂在Project Galaxy上](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ldyd9CJ4ijpBRRENhgYxJ.png?height=1588&width=2658)\n\n另外一个值得介绍的项目是Rabbithole，它是“学习认证”类项目的代表。它希望游戏化思维，将每个去中心化应用分解为游戏任务，引导用户与区块链协议、去中心化应用进行交互，培育 DeFi 用户的使用习惯，同时用户的 Web3 操作和行为还将获得“认证”。从某种意义上，Rabbithole项目正在给未来的课程结业证书、甚至简历构建打下雏形。\n\n![Rabbithole的技能学习](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ofhd4KyscsoUFy0MaV-qg.png?height=1332&width=2320)\n\n## 4. 未来展望\n\n通过上述的分析，可以看出目前DID的发展依然处于早期探索阶段，有不少关键的问题仍然需要Web3建设者们去探索。对于这些问题，个人观点如下：\n\n**最关键的问题，是DID的产品形态之争**：DID会像Unipass那样，朝Web3的入口方向发展，与钱包赛道相融合？还是会作为承上启下的枢纽，提供对用户真人鉴定、信用评分等协议接口，服务于各种上层应用？还是还是短期内更偏向于和Web2各平台的融合，通过“与Web2共存”的方式来强化认证的可靠性和有效性？也许这三条道路会是相互交融的，甚至也许还可能有别的道路，这些目前都还没有答案。**个人倾向于认为它会发展成为Web3的入口 —— 毕竟在大众用户的心智中，总需要一个尽可能简单、全面的“入口”**。当前类似于Metamask的钱包在全面性上做的远远不够，而聚合类的DID或许是一个方案。Web1的门户网站、Web2的搜索引擎、移动互联网中微信使用时长的不断提升和小程序生态的繁荣，都印证了这一点。\n\n**其次重要的问题，是关于“数字人”与“真人”之争**：Web3应用的服务方到底应该是链下的真人，还是链下真人在数字世界中创建的镜像？后者似乎更加符合Web3的理念初心，但从Web3的全球监管合规化和大众普及角度考虑，真人的验证或许将是难以避免的。个**人认为，未来不排除这两者有共存的可能：经过真人认证的账号将在Web3世界中享有更多的权利，但纯粹的数字人依然也会被接受**。\n\n**另外衍生的问题，是关于隐私保护的问题**：随着各种认证、评分的增多，甚至是真人链下信息的绑定，总有一些信息用户是不希望暴露在链上、可被随时查看的。当然，用户也不会希望这些数据放在项目方的中心化数据库里，这样就失去Web3的意义了。如何保护用户的身份信息，仅让其在必要的时候披露给必要的对象，也是DID在技术实现中所要面临的问题。\n\n综上所述，DID赛道依然处于混沌的“莽荒时代”，这也将会是各路冒险家大展身手的舞台。\n\n## 5.投资建议\n\n虽然不少DID赛道的项目已经公开发行了代币，但多数项目的币价最高点往往出现在2021年11-12月的时候，现在的币价相比于最高点都有非常大的回落，有兴趣的读者可以去具体做些搜寻。\n\n为什么会出现这种情况？\n\n从情绪面上来看，21年底的时候正值新一轮牛市，随着Roblox的上市和Sandbox、Decentralized Land项目币价的飙升，“元宇宙”“Web3”相关概念异常火热，DID作为Web3的枢纽，也引来了社区情绪的FOMO。而在5月的现在，随着BTC、美股的层层下跌，再加上LUNA崩盘事件的阴影，社区的情绪是极度恐慌的，对于这类发展\n\n从项目基本面来看，DID本质上也属于偏基础设施的赛道。多数项目的代币难以构建很好的经济模型和应用场景，再加上其并不多的用户数、不高的增长速度，社区情绪过后引发币价下跌，也是一件可以理解的事情。\n\n从行业基本面来看，DID虽然确实是Web3发展的一大瓶颈所在，但它并不是唯一的瓶颈 —— 基础设施的不完善、用户上手成本的高昂等，都是老生常谈的其它问题。现在Web3在应用层可以说是“超金融化”的，除了Defi借贷、NFT交易等个别与用户交易行为直接关联的赛道之外，多数依然处于探索期，而DID的发展毕竟是需要真实应用场景做支撑的。在应用层如此现状之下，多数DID项目的用户数据不佳，也是可以理解的。\n\n因此，经过如上分析，**当下时点个人并不建议对DID项目采取短线投资的策略。毕竟短期内这些项目很难有高增长和大爆发，再加上整体市场依然在走熊，这些项目的币价很可能仍然存在下跌空间**。\n\n**但从长期来看，Web3若要实现真正的井喷式发展，必须要有成熟的DID解决方案，一定会有项目成为赛道龙头。所以，不妨用风险投资的思维，在自己看好的项目足够便宜的时候买入并长期持有，期待其将来成为赛道头部，实现数十倍乃至数百倍的回报**。\n\n###

{"id": "Lqhwv_mlfGgH-zKEGaOKU3Z2sIAwPJ3s7uoK0OlvNL0", "title": "An Introduction to zkSync", "body": "[zkSync](https://zksync.io/) is a L2 blockchain that uses zkRollups to enable high throughput and low-gas transfers. This post is my understanding of zkSync and zkRollups. The following topics are discussed in this post:\n\n* The blockchain trilemma and goal of layer 2 scaling solutions.\n* A definition of zkSync, zkRollup, and zkSNARK.\n* An explanation of how zkSync achieves high throughput, fast finality, and low-gas transfers.\n\nThis is written in May 2022. The accuracy of information in this post can change based on upgrades to zkSync or Ethereum.\n\n## The Scalability Problem\n\nEthereum is a decentralized and secure blockchain, but it’s not scalable due to its low throughput of roughly [15 transactions per second](https://ethtps.info/Network/Ethereum). When the network gets busy, transaction speed slows down, resulting in a queue of transactions. During slow speeds, users participate in a bidding war, increasing their gas prices in an effort to jump the queue and get included in the next block. Ethereum miners change the order of transactions in favor of those with the highest priority fee. This creates a slow and expensive user experience.\n\nThe goal of scalability is to increase transaction throughput and speed of finality. The challenge is doing this without sacrificing decentralization or security. This challenge is known as the [blockchain trilemma](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-the-blockchain-trilemma), the idea that blockchains can only achieve two out of the three properties with respect to decentralization, security, and scalability. In an attempt to solve the blockchain trilemma, upgrades to Ethereum aim to make the network more scalable and secure without sacrificing decentralization.\n\nThere are many [approaches](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/#scaling-overview) to scaling Ethereum, including on-chain solutions like sharding and off-chain solutions like plasma, state channels, rollups, and sidechains. Layer 2 (L2) is a category of scaling solutions that consists of smart contracts deployed on Layer 1 (L1) that are responsible for processing deposits, withdrawals, and verifying proofs, while computation and storage are performed off-chain. Unlike sidechains, L2 inherits the security of the L1 network. It is one of the most promising scaling solutions available today. There are currently three main L2 solutions: State Channels, Plasma, and Rollups.\n\n## zkRollups, zkProofs, zk-SNARKs\n\nA rollup is a type of L2 scaling solution that batches transactions off-chain and submits them to L1 as a single transaction. There are two types of rollups, Oprimistic Rollups and [Zero Knowledge Rollups (zkRollups)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/). In this post, I will only cover zkRollups, the scaling mechanism used by zkSync. zkRollups is a type of rollup that uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to prove the validity of transactions in a rollup block (batch of transactions).\n\nZero Knowledge (ZK) refers to one party being able to prove to another that a particular set of information is true, without revealing what that information is, hence there is zero knowledge of the information but there is proof that it exists. [Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK)](https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/) is a type of ZKP used by zkRollups. A zk-SNARK is generated for each rollup block which is then verified on-chain by the L1 contract. Each zk-SNARK includes a proof of the validity of every single transaction in a rollup block.\n\nProcessing transactions off-chain enables rollups to increase throughput. Computation executed off-chain does not affect the speed of the on-chain part of the transaction. Rollups use compression to reduce the size of on-chain data. By reducing the size of on-chain data, rollups not only increase finality speeds, but they reduce the cost of gas. Having less on-chain data saves processing power, time, and storage.\n\n## The Contender\n\n[zkSync](https://zksync.io/) is a L2 blockchain that uses zkRollups to enable high transaction throughput and low-gas transfers.\n\n**High Transaction Throughput**\n\nzkSync scales transaction throughput with speeds of [2000+ transactions per second](https://docs.zksync.io/zkevm/#basics). It achieves this by reducing the amount of on-chain transaction data, allowing for transactions to be processed more quickly and for more transactions to fit in a block. Only a cryptographic proof and the state delta (the change in the state of the L2 blockchain) are stored on-chain.\n\n**Fast Finality**\n\nFinality in a rollup block can be reached in as fast as 10 minutes. Transactions in zkSync reach finality as soon as a SNARK proof for a particular rollup block is posted and verified by the L1 smart contract. This is a significant advantage over Fraud Proofs, which require up to 7 days for a transaction to reach finality.\n\nThe off-chain confirmation for transactions on zkSync are [instant](https://docs.zksync.io/userdocs/tech.html#instant-confirmations), however, users still rely on the validator to include the transaction in a rollup block. In the future, zkSync validators will be required to add a [security bond](https://docs.zksync.io/userdocs/tech.html#instant-confirmations) to the network as an economic guarantee that they will include the transaction in a rollup block.\n\n**Low Gas Fees**\n\nAs a result of using SNARK validity proofs and compressing on-chain data, zkSync is able to reduce gas costs by [up to 200x](https://docs.zksync.io/userdocs/tech.html#zk-rollup-architecture) compared to a L1 transaction. SNARKs allow zkSync to only store the SNARK itself and the state delta on-chain. Everything else is computed and stored off-chain, where operation costs are fractions of a cent per transaction. The data for every rollup block is published as a root hash in L1 calldata, the lowest-cost data location. By bundling thousands of transactions, users split the cost of a single L1 transaction, reducing gas costs even further.\n\n**Gasless Meta-Transactions**\n\nzkSync supports gasless meta-transactions, enabling users to pay gas fees in the token being transferred. Meta-transactions are transactions in which a relayer pays the gas fee in ether on behalf of the sender. Dapps on zkSync can choose to sponsor the fee or they can have validators accept ERC-20 tokens for gas fees. This abstracts gas from the UX because it no longer requires users to have an ether balance or adjust gas settings.\n\n**Scalable Payments**\n\nGiven the low-gas transfers and high throughput of zkRollups, zkSync works as an exceptional solution for scalable payments. With transaction throughput equal to, if not greater than Visa, zkSync can be used as a payment solution for p2p, e-commerce, retail, and more. [zkCheckout](https://checkout.zksync.io/link) allows users to accept token payments on zkSync via payment links that function as payable invoices. Developers can use the [zkCheckout SDK](https://docs.zksync.io/api/sdk/checkout/tutorial.html#structure-of-the-tutorial) to implement payments via zkSync onto any website. zkCheckout has already been implemented into [Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-grants-round-8/) as a checkout option.\n\n**Mainnet-Level Security**\n\nBecause zkSync is a L2 solution, it inherits the security and decentralization of Ethereum. Once the rollup block is verified and produced in L1, it is immutable. Users do not have to rely on 3rd parties or validators for the security of their funds. Validators are not able to corrupt the state of the L2 blockchain nor steal user funds. If zkSync validators stop cooperating and fail to include user transactions in a rollup block, users can use an emergency exit function to withdraw funds back to L1. There is no operational activity required on zkSync to keep the funds safe.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEthereum L2 scaling solutions are live and thriving with close to [$5 billion](https://l2beat.com/) in combined TVL. Currently, there are several implementations of an EVM-compatible Optimistic Rollup. zkRollups are getting there, with several projects working towards EVM-compatibility. The scaling and gas improvements brought forward by zkSync are a significant step towards mass crypto adoption.\n\nSmart contract support will come at the release of [zkSync 2.0,](https://docs.zksync.io/zkevm/#general) an upgrade that will include an EVM-compatible zkRollup. It will enable existing Ethereum applications to seamlessly launch on zkSync as well as allow Solidity developers to building natively on L2. The uptick in banking on a fast, cheap, and secure L2 is near.\n\n__\n\nFeedback? Message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/silecrypto). \n Questions?

On May 11, the relevant person in charge of the Ministry of transport responded to social hot issues such as how to ensure connectivity and people’s livelihood.\n\nLet the truck run and let the logistics pass\n\nIn view of the problems encountered by many truck drivers during transportation due to the epidemic in recent times, the relevant person in charge of the Ministry of transport introduced that it has guided all localities to classify and accurately implement truck traffic guarantee measures, implement the requirements of “pick and go” and “closed-loop management”, and effectively ensure the smooth passage of freight vehicles.\n\nHanjinghua, deputy director of the transportation service department of the Ministry of transport: all localities are required to accurately implement traffic control according to the actual travel of freight vehicles and drivers and passengers, whether they are involved in epidemic diseases, etc., and shall not use the place of origin and registered residence as the conditions for restricting traffic. It is required to completely cancel the restrictions on the epidemic prevention access of freight vehicles from low-risk areas. For freight vehicles with drivers and passengers from low-risk areas, that is, the green communication travel card without  sign, all localities shall not restrict the access at will.\n\nMake every effort to ensure smooth logistics in key areas\n\nAt present, the epidemic situation in the Yangtze River Delta is still grim. The Ministry of transport said that it should go all out to ensure smooth logistics in key areas. For enterprises included in the “white list” of the supply chain, priority transportation capacity support, priority loading and unloading, priority distribution and other services shall be taken.\n\nTake multiple measures to smooth the “last mile” of urban distribution\n\nIn addition, in order to solve the “last mile” problem of urban material distribution, the Ministry of transport will guide all localities to unseal the closed postal express distribution centers, business outlets and express service stations in an orderly manner on the premise of meeting the epidemic prevention requirements and strictly implementing the epidemic prevention and control measures.\n\nHan Jinghua, deputy director of the transportation service department of the Ministry of transport: focusing on the guarantee of operation and transfer, guide all localities to delimit the logistics distribution node network outside the sealing area as far as possible to ensure the orderly operation of the network; If the logistics distribution node is located outside the sealing area, control area and prevention area, it shall not be shut down without authorization; If it is really necessary to shut down the transfer of inter provincial and inter municipal production and living materials and mail express within the prevention area and control area, it shall be submitted to the provincial and municipal joint prevention and control mechanism for approval according to the procedures.", "timestamp": 1653257285, "digest": "TpXxBAgZQdHs_M7EJuckGVXKx8Wap6Qs7a0rpS5y5eQ", "contributor": "0x2bE779A9677054C0C1644185E59BE05AaD3Ed764"}
{"id": "Y27sCzFvmKobOJliFaS4i1xSrihZL5IGgREntHsIaC8", "title": "Securing Discord ", "body": "Permissions and roles, the administrator needs to understand every permission and role in order to limit the attack vector and limit exposure. It’s about accountability, and taking responsibility for things we can control and understanding where we are vulnerable. Every discord we build should be built in mind with each and every single user being subject to compromise. Therefore, we have a PLAN in place BEFORE the attack, and do everything we can to mitigate and sometimes null the attack (before it takes place). But there is one role that must NEVER be compromised, and we can lock it down before the discord is open to the public.\n\n## Discord Creator/Founder Role\n\n![The discord creator/founder role is identified by the CROWN.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9pNu0CAI42af7dO2yqzFv.png?height=67&width=284)\n\nThe account that creates the discord should NEVER be an active USER in the server (once it is open) or even active anywhere outside of the server. It is OK if you use an active account to create the discord, but BEFORE going public, this role should be transferred to a burner account (preferably brand new account with email and discord name unassociated with the server/unrecognizable). This account is NOT used for anything else, other than being a ‘hardware wallet/ledger’ for the server. \n \n\n![This role can be transferred to ANYONE, but only by the user with the role. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z-qwDiAGit7tqsl0bucQR.png?height=126&width=184)\n\n \n No matter what the permissions and roles are in a server, no matter the hierarchy of those roles, the **FOUNDER/CREATOR** account bypasses all restrictions and has absolute control over the entire server and every role within it. The good news is, we can completely eliminate this attack vector and keep it in cold storage, unmarked and hidden away on the server. This account doesn’t need any special roles or identifiable markings and we in fact recommend keeping it that way. \n  \n Users may be able to use tools to figure it out, or discord itself may do a poor job of hiding it, but we do NOT need to bring any extra attention to this role, nor do we need to put it at risk by using it on an active account. With the account taken out of play and not in use, there is no chance of anyone phishing or gaining access to this account. Furthermore if an Admin is compromised, we always have one role above it, hidden and ready to ‘break in case of emergency’ and regain control of the server/eradicate the threat. If this role is ever compromised in this way, we know the attack came from within and limit it to only the person who had access to it being responsible.\n\n## Roles, Permissions, & Hierarchy\n\nThe next most vulnerable area of attack is ANYONE with administrator permissions in the server (humans and bots). Administrator permissions bypass ALL roles and restrictions within the discord and channels HOWEVER they still cannot change or alter the roles at or above them. This hierarchy of roles can be used to our advantage when structuring discord roles and permissions.\n\n![Subject to change, missing verification bot.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/F6xf2NACQwCapIOCRrmR6.png?height=674&width=677)\n\nUnderstanding ADMIN access is vulnerable to attack, we place the ONLY human role with admin at the very TOP (+) role and we only grant it to few individuals who need it. I recommend 2-3 at max, depending on the size of the server. I furthermore recommend that those working in this position understand they are NOT allowed to use these accounts to degen into other servers or operate on them for anything else other than doing their administrator work in the discords they are working on. It’s a lot of responsibility, it’s a job and should be treated as such. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TeYlyd392eMzpwYNbSLy-.png?height=246&width=218)\n\n \n Notice this role is neither hoisted, nor visible on the sidebar, nor is it colored and meant to stand out. The vanity roles which mark and signify Admin, Mod, and Team do NOT have Admin access and they are restricted only to the channels they need for their job.  \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_S9lbFudcm3_Jefh3uOHG.gif?height=442&width=536)\n\nThese roles have an identifiable color and mark, sometimes with emoji icons and hoisted above all other roles. We expect these roles to be targeted and plan for them to be compromised. Therefore we plan ahead of time to mitigate the damage anyone can do with these roles with this structure and limitation of perms. Again, the only true Admins of the server have the (+) role and no ONE can give them this role, except for the founder/creator role which is on ice and locked away. And those with this + role take on extra responsibility and limit their attack vectors and exposure. \n  \n After administrator permissions (which again bypasses all restrictions, except hierarchy of roles) the next biggest threat is who has access to INFORMATION channels, with the biggest targets being on #Announcements & #Official Links channels. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jy5bYbeigGGeeMs8WA7bo.png?height=842&width=1013)\n\nThe standard setup takes away everyone’s ability to write in this channel except for the intended user/role which overrides the nulled send message permission. Again Administrators still have absolute access and bypass all restrictions.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ztSxAiQQQn49fEfMnAgYX.png?height=850&width=1006)\n\nTherefore we NEVER grant anyone *permanent* control of these channels and limit their access with the (++) role. Only the true administrator (+) role has permanent access (as admin negates these restrictions) and only the (+) role can grant access.  \n  \n It is therefore recommend that his exchange of power and communication for it be done (off and away from discord). Either through the use of text, whatsapp, or other platforms. This way even if a users discord account is compromised, the attackers do NOT have a means to ask for access to these permissions (other than discord channels and DMs, which we will NEVER use to ask for these permissions).  \n  \n Now attackers need full use to an admins device (phone or computer) to entirely compromise them. These attackers are not doing this yet, but as we up our security they may which means we will need more security and practices outside of discord.\n\n## Trusted Bots\n\nAfter removing the attack vector from the Creator/Founder account, limiting attack vectors to only trusted admin (+) role, our last area of exposure are the bots we use and the permissions we grant them. For projects of larger scale, I highly recommend fully-custom built, in-house bots to limit exposure and responsibility. As much as we dislike Azuki’s founder, I do applaud their server for having no compromises as all their bots are custom built. They remain a high target and have completely avoided compromise, this is worth noting and paying attention to regardless of feelings towards Zagabond or their project. \n  \n Not everyone can afford this option, but for any project that is bringing in hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars, there is no excuse. The only other options are to completely remove all bots from the server (which takes away logs and much welcomed automation), or to have very limited bots in the server strictly permed for their roles, and having the structure setup in a way to prepare for their compromise.\n\n![This build is currently missing a verification gate, I believe I'd place it here - but this is subject to change. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/44gE4YUgygYuvzZohaJEM.png?height=426&width=678)\n\nAs it currently stands I have WICK above all other bots, with the quarantine role above them, but below Wick. This way we can rely on Wick to quarantine and remove all threats (including any of these bots being compromised). The problem with this build is that we are putting A LOT of faith in wick not being compromised. However, Wick is a PAID service and built with security in mind. Even if a user granted themselves a permission in this server, they wouldn’t be able to access and change the wick dashboard settings unless the server owner gave them access (which again, this account is locked away on cold storage).  \n  \n When a Mee6 employee was compromised, and they were able to bypass server settings and change permissions and roles, the one server with Wick operating as intended (PXN) was able to instantly & automatically remove any webhooks and posts in their announcement channel. This was because the user was NOT whitelisted to post on the backend/dashboard of Wick. Even though an admin was compromised, Wick still didn’t allow that admin to post. Again it still puts a lot of faith in Wick and if you operate a large-scale project, I recommend you make your own.\n\n## In Conclusion\n\nServer Creator/Founder should be kept on ice and taken out of play. Humans with Admin access and perms above all other roles should be very limited and ready to take full responsibility and accountability for their role. It should be a paid job and those in that position should understand how to properly build and manage a discord. \n  \n BOTs in the server should be very limited in permissions and channels for only their needed purpose and those that aren’t we should understand fully how much faith and trust we are granting in them (as much as an ADMIN) if they have administrator access. Depending on the size and scale of your business, understand what that means. \n  \n There are discords that have NEVER been compromised, or if compromised, had minimal damage (threats instantly eradicated). We should all understand why that was and open-source our security as much as possible to team up against these threats. Understand this does NOT replace a much needed job and position within this space as we can give someone the keys to a helicopter and they still cannot fly it, or the schematics to a building and not everyone can build it.", "timestamp": 1653253695, "digest": "KYe8hFL2h-zwuDbIMOBxjPSVooAeUkTcWa_UAkhu5aE", "contributor": "0x2f14fBa7f3b90DAA8DE0f35DfE0c6859cBB0034a"}

{"id": "mRlvS8G9_UYEFv3Dasr2NHby87Bb_6NSJDLD7zIZo1U", "title": "Don't step on thunder when buying a car", "body": "Recently, China Insurance Research Institute c-iasi announced the collision test results of seven models: Buick GL8, Tesla Model y, Citroen Tianyi C5, Buick oncoway s, Toyota c-hr, tank 300 and xinxinjun. There are many popular models in the subdivided fields. Today, combined with the test results released this time, assuming that one of them is just covered in your car purchase plan, how to choose?\n\n1、 Buick GL8\n\nOfficial selling price: 2329-533900 yuan\n\nModel overview: Buick GL8 probably didn’t expect that this unique Chinese model can firmly rank first in the current Chinese MPV market (don’t compare Wuling and Chang’an with it, which are not pure MPV models). Some people say that it benefits from its fashionable design and accurate grasp of the Chinese market. These points are true, but if Buick GL8 talks about money and generation, its history is far less than that of Odyssey and Senna.\n\nSuccess is not unreasonable. Friends who have taken Buick GL8 know that its loading capacity is still very strong. It can be said that it perfectly deduces the space performance of an MPV. In the most worrying third row space, GL8 can also be easily handled. When used, the trunk space can still accommodate three boarding boxes of about 20 inches. Because of its strong space performance, GL8 has today’s position in the market.\n\nHowever, only space is obviously not enough. In recent years, Buick GL8 began to make a big fuss at the luxury level, and the car series is also divided into ordinary version and luxury Avenir Avia version. The whole system is equipped with 2.0T engine. In this way, Buick GL8 has maintained a good sales volume with complete lining and face. Looking at all the competitors, even if the powers are around, it will stand firm.\n\nIn terms of safety, Buick GL8 also participated in the crash test of China Insurance Research Institute before, but its performance was not ideal in the earlier test. There was also a bending of A-pillar. This collision is the medium-term modified model of GL8. From the test results, it can be seen that the medium-term modified GL8 has a commission in all aspects of safety performance, especially in the 25% offset collision, from the previous P (poor) to a (good), The roof strength has also been improved from a (good) to G (excellent).\n\nAfter the mid-term modification of GL8, the A-pillar was slightly deformed in the 25% offset collision, which was much better than that of the old model. The GL8 in the side impact has also lost serious points before, and has also been improved on the new models. On the whole, although the overall performance of the medium-term modified GL8 has not reached the optimal state, considering the adverse factors in its MPV structure, the progress in security of the medium-term modified GL8 is still worthy of recognition. However, it can be further strengthened in terms of body materials.\n\n2、 Buick oncoway\n\nOfficial selling price: 209900-309900 yuan\n\nIf you were asked to buy an SUV within the price range of 200000 yuan, would you include Buick ankovi in the alternative list? It is estimated that many consumers are unlikely to choose it. In this price range, there are countless domestic SUVs, which have made great efforts in terms of space, power and configuration. But the test still needs to be tested. Whether it sells well or not is put aside. First of all, the car must be OK.\n\nSimilarly, playing back the old Buick oncoway model, there was no small controversy in the first phase of the test of China Insurance Research Institute, because oncoway is a model produced in China and then sold back to the U.S. market. It can be said that the Chinese Standard Version of the old oncoway and the returned models have achieved very different results in the test of China Insurance Research Institute and the IIHS crash test in the United States. Especially in the rigid performance of the roof, there are great differences between the two. The medium gauge version is very “straddling”.\n\nUp to now, China Insurance Research Institute has tested Buick ankway s model again. We see that it has achieved g excellence in the passenger safety index in the vehicle, 25% offset collision on the driver’s side is also g excellence, and the roof strength and side collision are also g excellence. Similarly, the pedestrian safety index and pedestrian protection outside the vehicle are also excellent. “Don’t steam steamed bread, fight for breath”. This time, Buick ankoway finally found a trace of face.\n\nHowever, in terms of crashworthiness and maintenance economy, ankoway received a poor evaluation of P. Get m general evaluation on vehicle auxiliary safety. In that sentence, combined with its price, in terms of safety assistance, leonkovic’s performance is far from reaching the standard of domestic cars of the same level.\n\nBut anyway, a strong body should come first. This is the foundation, but at the same time, we can’t ignore the balanced performance of some safety auxiliary configurations. We hope that oncoway will continue to maintain excellent achievements in future collisions and see more progress at the same time.\n\n3、 Citroen Tianyi C5 Aircross\n\nOfficial selling price: RMB 159700-229700\n\nLooking at the selling price of Citroen Tianyi C5 Aircross, it will undoubtedly be more people-friendly and grounded. From the side, it also truly reflects the dilemma of Citroen models in the domestic market. In fact, in this test, I would like to see the performance of Versailles c5x, but this time, China Insurance and Research Institute chose Citroen Tianyi C5 Aircross as the player, which is also worthy of attention.\n\nBut unexpectedly, the Citroen C5 Aircross Tianyi, as the representative of the legal system car, did not achieve excellent results. Look at its test results:\n\nFirstly, in the 25% offset collision, it is a (good), and the A-pillar has a certain bending; To tell you the truth, it’s a little out of line with the consistent performance of legal cars. It’s very unexpected. Second, the front side air curtain of the vehicle is not large enough, and the score of side impact is a. the air curtain blocks the dummy’s head between the air curtain and the window. If there is a traffic accident, it will be extremely dangerous. I don’t know whether it is a design problem or a sudden case.\n\nThird, in the roof strength test, the peak load of Citroen Tianyi was only 53954 n, which did not meet the excellent standard of four times the vehicle weight.\n\nAfter watching the performance of Tianyi, the author was also surprised. We should know that Tianyi C5 Aircross is a global model of Citroen. In the previous Euro NCAP test collision, it received a 5-star evaluation. In the official publicity, it is clearly pointed out that", "timestamp": 1653258669, "digest": "gX5miCZTOE4r_4qfIXV58czNvien4UII9Q5e9TrW0CM", "contributor": "0xed871cB9957f3820D40a8972664fFdfBCA51ABCa"}

On May 20, the S\\&P 500 briefly fell into bear market territory, indicating that traders continue to sell risky assets in fear of a recession. \n\nDue to its tight correlation with US equities markets, Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) has remained under pressure for many weeks. The bulls are attempting to push Bitcoin [higher during the weekend](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-targets-record-8th-weekly-red-candle-while-btc-price-limits-weekend-losses) and avert an even longer losing streak.\n\n![](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2022-05/f002ea05-8f8a-4299-9a96-07d8c679310c.png)\n\n*Crypto market data daily view. Source:** *[*Coin360*](https://coin360.com/)\n\nBitcoin’s performance in the first five months has been the worst since 2018, indicating that sellers are in control. However, after several weeks of weakness, the crypto markets may be on the cusp of a [bear market rally](https://cointelegraph.com/trading-for-beginners/bull-vs-bear-crypto-market-what-is-the-difference-and-how-to-handle-both).\n\nWhat are the critical levels that may signal the start of a sustained recovery? Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the near term.\n\n## BTC/USDT\n\nBitcoin rebounded off the crucial support at $28,630 on May 20, indicating strong buying near this level. The bulls are attempting to push the price above the downtrend line, which could be the first indication that the selling pressure may be reducing.\n\n![](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2022-05/34a8a16e-b22f-4cbc-8cb4-38f836814546.png)\n\n*BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView*\n\nAbove the downtrend line, the BTC/USDT pair could rise to the 20-day exponential moving average ($31,887). The bears are likely to defend this level with vigor. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will once again try to sink the pair below $28,630.\n\nIf they manage to do that, the pair could drop to $26,700. This is an important level to keep an eye on because a break and close below it could open the doors for a decline to $25,000 and then to $21,800.\n\nConversely, if buyers thrust the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could attempt a rally to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $34,823. If this level is scaled, the pair could climb to the 50-day simple moving average ($37,289).\n\n![](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2022-05/798c16b5-94df-4242-92eb-b33b10b4ff5f.png)\n\n*BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView*\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the price is getting squeezed between the downtrend line and $28,630. The 20-EMA and the 50-SMA have flattened out and the relative strength index (RSI) is just above the midpoint suggesting a balance between supply and demand.\n\nThis balance could tilt in favor of buyers if they push and sustain the price above the downtrend line. If that happens, the pair could start its northward march toward the 200-SMA.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from the current level, the bears will attempt to sink the pair below $28,630 and gain the upper hand.\n\n## BNB/USDT\n\nBinance Coin ([BNB](https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index)) recovered sharply from the critical support at $211 and has reached the overhead resistance at the 20-day EMA ($323). This is an important level for the bears to defend because a break and close above it could indicate that a bottom may be in place.\n\n![](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2022-05/4076e671-1621-4b7c-a706-e682aee9fa2a.png)\n\n*BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView*\n\nAbove the 20-day EMA, the BNB/USDT pair could rally to $350 and thereafter to the 50-day SMA ($376). This level could again act as a stiff hurdle but if bulls thrust the price above it, the pair could rally to the 200-day SMA ($451).\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears have not yet given up and they continue to sell at higher levels.

Systems integration and controlled environments are used to make the most efficient use of space and resources.  \n\nThese methods are not only capable of producing large quantities of food, but also of doing so in a way that is gentle on the environment. As vertical farming becomes more widespread, it has the potential to transform the way we think about food production. \n\nOne key advantage of vertical farming is that it is much more efficient than traditional farming methods. \n\nFor example, vertical farms can use up to 95% less water than traditional farms, and they can be located near urban areas, which reduces transportation costs. In addition, vertical farms can be operated year-round, meaning that there is no need for seasonal breaks. \n\nAs a result, vertical farming is a much more efficient way of producing food. In addition to being efficient, vertical farming is also sustainable. Because vertical farms use less water and land, they have a smaller environmental footprint than traditional farms.\n\nIn addition, Vertical farms can use recycled materials for things like walls and ceilings, further reducing their environmental impact. As more people become aware of the benefits of vertical farming, it is likely that this method of agriculture will become increasingly. \n\nIt's no secret that the quality of our food has been declining in recent years. But what is the cause of this decline? One major factor is the way that our food is produced. \n\nIn order to maximize profits, many farmers and food producers have turned to mass production methods that sacrifice quality for quantity. This has led to a diminished nutrient content in our fruits and vegetables. As a result, we are not getting the we need to stay healthy.\n\n The three most popular methods for growing plants without soil are aquaponics, hydroponics and aeroponics. All of these techniques can often result in bigger and healthier crops than traditional plant-growing methods that rely on topsoil rich with nutrients. \n\nBut what if there was a way to combine the best of all worlds? That's where solar panels come in. Solar panels can be used to power hydroponic, aquaponic, and aeroponic systems, making them more efficient and effective. \n\nNot only that, but the system can also help to regulate temperature and humidity levels, providing the perfect environment for plant growth. \n\nBy integrating the growing system, you can increase yields, reduce costs, and create a more sustainable and eco-friendly operation.", "timestamp": 1653260347, "digest": "ySbF7egGqe5H7mr7_EFkqvbOjwinbrSHRnVhdBl0c8I", "contributor": "0xC38A688a3c8111B174aaa30c6576da598Dd74cCF"}

In addition, we can help to reduce the carbon footprint of the food production process by using less land and water.\n\nA decentralized food supply chain is one in which food production, processing, distribution, and consumer purchases are integrated and coordinated within a relatively short distance.\n\nThe decentralized food supply system is an alternative to the industrial food system, which is reliant on large-scale monocrop production, long-distance transport, and global trade.\n\nA decentralized system is often more efficient and higher quality than an industrialized one. Modular technology can help small scale producers to grow more food and produce more food with less effort.\n\nWith patented protection over corporate influence and a dedication to the creative commons for we will scale the development our technology so producers can easily setup integrated solutions, products, and services to participate toward decentralization.\n\nThis will result in more people having access to fresh, healthy food. It will also reduce the environmental impact of the food system by minimizing transportation distances and energy use.\n\nOver the last century, there have been significant advances in our understanding of plant genetics and how plants develop.\n\nThis has allowed us to create new plant varieties that are more resistant to disease and pests, and that can grow in a wider range of environmental conditions. However, much of this research has been focused on individual genes and on making small changes to the plant's DNA.\n\nThis approach has its limits, as it is difficult to predict how a plant will respond to a change in its environment. A more promising approach is to create controlled environments in which plants can be grown under specific conditions.\n\nThe study of plant development and evolution in a controlled setting, and to identify plant plant growth patterns and their best suited particular environment.\n\nThis systems approach also gives the opportunity to stabilize or amplify the existing conditions in a local environment, which can help to improve plant productivity in marginal areas.\n\nEnvironmental sensors are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and their use is providing researchers with a greater understanding of plant development and evolution.\n\nBy tracking the environmental conditions under which plants grow, sensors can help to identify the plant varieties that are best suited for a particular environment.\n\nIn addition, sensors can be used to monitor the progress of plant growth, and to track the movement of pollen and other plant materials. This information can then be used to develop new methods of crop production, and to identify potential problems with existing crops.\n\nAs sensors become more affordable and easier to use, they are likely to play an increasingly important role in the study of plant development and evolution.\n\nThe vertical farm is a type of agricultural facility that produces crops in vertically stacked layers. Sensor systems integrated into the framework of the vertical farm offer potential to generate valuable data about plant development under controlled environmental conditions.\n\nThese sensor systems can measure factors such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, and carbon dioxide levels. Measuring environmental factors will likely play an increasingly important role in the study of plant development and evolution.\n\nIn addition, sensor data can be used to optimize growing conditions for specific crops, resulting in higher yields and better quality produce. The integrated sensor system have the potential to revolutionize agriculture by making it more efficient, productive, and sustainable.\n\nA vertical farm is a type of agriculture where crops are grown in vertically stacked layers in a controlled environment.Vertical farms can be used to grow a variety of crops, including fruits, vegetables, and grains.\n\nOne major benefit of vertical farming is that it allows farmers to grow crops year-round, regardless of the weather outside. Additionally, because vertical farms are typically located in urban areas, they can help to reduce the amount of land needed for agriculture.\n\nVertical farms also use less water than traditional farms, and they can minimize the spread of pests and diseases. As a result, vertical farming is an increasingly popular option for those looking to produce food in a more sustainable way.\n\nIntegrated sensor systems offer the potential to generate valuable data about plant development by measuring a variety of environmental factors.\n\nSensors can measure light levels, soil moisture, and temperature. This data can be used to track the progress of a plant's growth, identify stressors that may be affecting its development, and predict future yield.\n\nIn addition, sensor systems can be used to monitor the health of a crop by detecting early signs of disease or pests. By providing detailed information about plant development, integrated sensor systems have the potential to revolutionize agriculture.\n\nIn order to optimize growing conditions for specific crops, it is necessary to collect data about the conditions under which the crop grows best.\n\nThis data can be collected through studies of the crop's natural habitat, experiments with different growing conditions, and surveys of farmers who have experience growing the crop. Once this data is collected, it can be analyzed to identify patterns and trends.\n\nThis analysis can then be used to develop models that predict how the crop will respond to different conditions. These models can be used to optimize the growing environment for the crop, thereby increasing yield and quality.\n\nIn order to ensure that the data is of high quality, it is important to use reliable sources and methods of collection and analysis. Using data and statistics to optimize growing conditions can be an effective way to increase crop yields and improve quality.\n\nThe vertical farm is a type of agriculture that is increasingly being adopted by farmers due to its many potential benefits.\n\nOne key advantage of the vertical farm is the integrated sensor system. This system monitors various parameters such as temperature, humidity, and light intensity. By doing so, it allows for greater control over the growing environment.\n\nAs a result, the plants can be grown more efficiently, with less water and fewer pesticides. In addition, the sensor system can also help to reduce food waste by alerting farmers when the produce is ready to harvest.\n\nOverall, the integrated sensor system of the vertical farm offers a number of potential benefits that make it an attractive option for agricultural production.\n\nWhile vertical growing technology and vertical farming offer a number of potential benefits, there are also a number of challenges that need to be addressed in order to realize these benefits. One challenge is the high initial investment cost.\n\nVertical farms require specialized equipment and infrastructure, which can be expensive. Additionally, vertical farms often require higher levels of energy and water consumption than traditional farming methods.\n\nUsing a specialized infrastructure we can find ways to build the tools required to scale outcomes of the innovation and technology in action. The current infrastructure is not equipped to handle the demand for these services.\n\nThe need for these specialized services has become more apparent as the use of technology in our everyday lives has increased. With the right tools in place, we can overcome these challenges and continue to innovate and improve the way we live and work.\n\nAs such, it is important to ensure that vertical farms are designed and operated in an efficient manner in order to minimize these costs. As vertical farming continues to grow in popularity, it is important to ensure that these farms are designed and operated in a way that minimizes costs.\n\nOne way to do this is by using efficient growing methods, such as hydroponics. In addition, it is important to use energy-efficient lighting and climate control systems.Another challenge is the lack of standards and regulations for vertical farming.\n\nThis lack of regulation can lead to a wide range of practices being used, which can make it difficult to compare the costs and benefits of different farms.\n\nAs vertical farms continue to grow in popularity, there is an increasing amount of public pressure on influencers to push for solutions that will lead to change in regulation.\n\nThis can often lead to a wide range of practices being used the key factors include the type of crops grown, the climatic conditions of the farm, the level of automation, and the size of the farm.\n\nAs vertical farming becomes more widespread, it is important to develop standards and regulations that will help to ensure that these farms are operated efficiently and in a way that minimizes costs.\n\nAs vertical farming is still a relatively new technology, there are no standardized methods or regulations governing its use.\n\nThis lack of standards can make it difficult for farmers to compare different types of vertical farms and choose the most appropriate option for their needs.\n\nFinally, vertical farms can generate a significant efficiency, which needs to be properly managed and utilized to offer the potential benefits. Vertically Integrated Agriculture is here to meet the number of challenges that need to be addressed in order to realize these benefits.", "timestamp": 1653260802, "digest": "Bn2P7dL7RPGAcWHu2fa_L2oqqDvIz6clhL9zoUbAsPM", "contributor": "0xC38A688a3c8111B174aaa30c6576da598Dd74cCF"}

The views of netizens are quite different: it is understandable for farmers to sell unripe wheat; Farmers are destroying grain by selling unripe wheat.\n\nOn May 10, the upstream news reporter obtained the notice on stepping up the verification of various wheat destruction problems issued by the general office of the Ministry of agriculture and rural areas, which showed that “the beginning of summer” has passed, and the wheat in the main production area has entered the grain filling period and is about to usher in the harvest season. Recently, there have been wheat destruction problems such as silage wheat in some places, which not only have an adverse impact on the harvest, but also have an adverse social impact. In order to resolutely put an end to similar incidents and ensure the safe storage of mature wheat particles, all localities, together with relevant departments, should pay close attention to the comprehensive investigation and investigation of all kinds of wheat destruction problems.\n\nThe notice requires that the main wheat producing areas should organize cities (counties) to comprehensively investigate whether there are various wheat destruction situations such as silage wheat, wheat destruction and planting trees, and dispatch whether there are breeding enterprises in the province to purchase silage wheat for feed and silage harvesting machinery for harvesting silage wheat. Find out the scale and analyze the specific reasons if any. Once the signs of wheat destruction are found, take effective measures to dispose and report at the first time, so as to minimize the adverse effects. Those preparing to use wheat for silage should be resolutely stopped. For the land requisitioned for construction and the wheat is about to mature, the work shall be started after the wheat is ripe and harvested. For those who destroy wheat and trees, we should strengthen the control of cultivated land use, find and correct them in time. Timely understand and report the handling of relevant responsible persons of wheat destruction events in various places.\n\nA professor from Huazhong Agricultural University, who asked not to be named, said that based on the characteristics and price of wheat, it is impossible for farms to use it as silage, which is just a helpless “expedient” for a few farms. The notice issued by the Ministry of agriculture and rural areas is very timely. It is to prevent small changes and correct the bad signs in time.\n\n▲ a few feed plants buy wheat in the filling stage at the price of 1500 yuan / mu. Image source / video screenshot\n\nThis article is reprinted from the upstream news. The original text was first published on May 10, 2022. The original title was “harvesting wheat as silage before ripening attracts attention, and the Ministry of agriculture and rural areas issued a notice to resolutely prohibit the destruction of wheat”, which does not represent the view of the outlook think tank.\n\none\n\nHenan express telegram:\n\nWheat cannot be used for silage\n\nIn the ranking of provincial grain output in 2021, Henan, the “granary of the Central Plains”, is second only to Heilongjiang. According to public reports, wheat production in Henan Province accounts for a quarter of the country, stable at more than 70 billion kg.\n\nOn May 8, before the Ministry of agriculture and rural areas issued the notice, the Department of agriculture and rural areas of Henan Province has issued an “urgent” internal telegram throughout the province.\n\nThe cable said that at present, wheat has entered the grain filling period, which is the key period for increasing grain weight and ensuring yield. There are only more than 20 days left from the beginning of harvest in a large area. Recently, there have been reports on the use of wheat for silage in some places on the Internet, which has been highly valued by the society.\n\nThe cable said that the destruction of wheat and the use of wheat as silage have exposed that a small number of cadres and relevant stakeholders in some places are not well positioned to safeguard national food security and have a weak awareness of protecting farmers’ interests. Agricultural and rural departments at all levels should fully understand the seriousness that wheat is the main ration and cannot be used for silage, and consciously shoulder the important task of food security from the height of stressing politics, the overall situation, discipline and people’s livelihood.\n\nThe message requires that from now until the end of the wheat harvest, no place, unit or person shall destroy wheat or use wheat for silage for any reason. All localities should rely on the strength of township and village grass-roots organizations to thoroughly investigate the events involving the destruction of wheat or the use of wheat for silage, leave no dead corners or blind areas, take resolute and effective measures to strengthen the protection of wheat fields, prevent the recurrence of all kinds of wheat destruction events, and strive to achieve a good harvest of summer grain.\n\nAfter the message was issued, all parts of Henan Province actively implemented it.\n\nOn May 10, the chief of Suiping County agricultural and rural Bureau in Zhumadian City, Henan Province, surnamed Li, told the upstream news reporter that after receiving the telegram, the bureau had made arrangements to prohibit the sale of wheat as silage. “Wheat can’t be sold until it’s ripe. If it’s sold, it will be held accountable.”\n\nIn Anhui, adjacent to Henan Province, a staff member of the agricultural and rural Bureau of Funan County, Fuyang City, also said that wheat could not be sold as silage.\n\nOn the morning of May 10, a staff member of the Ministry of agriculture and rural areas told the upstream news reporters that all localities will introduce requirements and regulations on wheat according to local conditions, which should be strictly implemented.\n\n▲ a few feed plants buy wheat in the filling stage at the price of 1500 yuan / mu. Image source / video screenshot\n\ntwo\n\nExpert opinion:\n\nSilage corn is more suitable for silage than wheat\n\nProfessor of Huazhong Agricultural University introduced that cattle and sheep breeding feed is divided into three kinds: fresh feed, silage and dry feed. Silage is a kind of coarse feed obtained by chopping and fermenting the green feed with a moisture content of 65% - 75%. It is more resistant to storage than fresh feed and has stronger nutritional components than dry feed. All green plants that can be used as feed can be used as silage raw materials. The commonly used silage raw materials in China are corn, ryegrass, Bromus inermis, alfalfa, clover, milkvetch and so on. “Cattle and sheep eat it better than dry feed, and the quality of meat and milk is high.” According to its incomplete statistics, silage corn is the most widely planted.\n\nThe upstream news reporter noted that the document “several opinions on strengthening reform and innovation and accelerating agricultural modernization” released on February 1, 2015 mentioned that we should accelerate the development of grassland and animal husbandry, support the planting of silage corn and alfalfa, carry out the test point of the combination mode of grain to feed and planting and breeding, and promote the development of ternary planting structure of grain, cash crops and forage.\n\nThe professor introduced that special corn varieties should be used to plant silage corn, which has high yield and good green retention. Planting 2 mu of silage corn can solve the annual silage supply of a high-yield cow. Ordinary corn is harvested in advance for silage, and the yield is low.\n\nIn the professor’s opinion, corn is more suitable for silage than wheat. “For one mu of land, the output of silage corn is more than 4 tons; for one mu of land, the output of wheat is only more than 1 ton. Planting wheat has no harvest because of management problems. Based on the consideration of no waste, it can be used as silage.”\n\nIn addition to its own characteristics, breeding enterprises will also buy silage corn based on cost considerations.\n\nMay 10, Anhui", "timestamp": 1653262424, "digest": "uu6L9HES7jOwzZMumV_edNfmbyFmYTardEJjL5f8t8M", "contributor": "0x485D48fDCD82ff1C62d85cF2E121eE27dCd4E286"}

MoonDAO launched on [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money) with an initial fundraising goal of $450,000 to send members into space and achieved huge success with [2,623 ETH (equivalent to $8.3 million at crowd raise close) raised from the community.\n](https://juicebox.money/#/p/moondao)\nThe community now has a treasury of [$40+ million dollars](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xce4a1E86a5c47CD677338f53DA22A91d85cab2c9/apps) (as of this writing) supported by MoonDAO’s governance token [$MOONEY](https://etherscan.io/token/0x20d4DB1946859E2Adb0e5ACC2eac58047aD41395), and has successfully purchased two tickets from Blue Origin to go to space. This represents MoonDAO’s first major milestone in space exploration, but this is only the first mission: MoonDAO has a multiyear road-map ahead of it.\n\n## How will MoonDAO choose who flies to space?\n\n![On May 16th at 8am PST: Our NFT Tickets will be released. $MOONEY holders will have a hand in deciding the winners.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ysr78JxUkdLk5RPmWAP9m.png?height=1920&width=1920)\n\nOn Sunday May 29th at 8am PST, MoonDAO is releasing a ticket to space NFT collection that gives the holders the opportunity of going to space.\n\nThe winners will have the opportunity to fly to space - provided that each individual must also meet Blue Origin’s requirements to fly. Blue Origin reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to evaluate all potential individuals and to approve or deny access to any voyage.\n\nThe holders of the ticket will also be airdropped [$MOONEY](https://etherscan.io/token/0x20d4DB1946859E2Adb0e5ACC2eac58047aD41395), our DAO’s governance token, such that they can vote on issues in the DAO.

Projects are wide-ranging and can involve research, engineering, governance, international space collaboration, or art. Current projects in the MoonDAO pipeline include the construction of a MoonDAO satellite, the production of the first music video filmed in space, and even preliminary projects leading to the design of a MoonDAO rocket.\n\n## How to join MoonDAO?\n\nAnyone can join MoonDAO by joining MoonDAO’s Discord! Contributors can also purchase MoonDAO’s governance token, $MOONEY,  giving its holders the right to govern the DAO and help lead humanity towards an inter-galactic future that brings everyone along for the ride.\n\n**There is no expectation of profit with the $MOONEY token. It is a governance token.

{"id": "euVjKT9Jby1V7sIsKftQLcNX8_eckdxIQQG61_h4lLE", "title": "Crypto's Consumer Era", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ec6478c7-7e84-4840-80b6-44a33a7b33c7.jpg?height=2080&width=3120)\n\nA few years ago it was common to hear the phrase, “we’re still waiting for crypto’s killer app.”\n\nCrypto markets weren’t quite ready for mainstream attention. The past five years of crypto were heavily focused on financial infrastructure and technological foundations.\n\nBut we’ve now experienced early product-market fit in DeFi, an explosion of projects like NBA Topshot, Axie Infinity, Cryptopunks and onboarded the first [\\~100M users](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/publications/3rd-global-cryptoasset-benchmarking-study/) to crypto. **The next 100M crypto users will be driven by consumer protocols, DAOs and applications.**\n\nTraditional consumer has gone through a transformation in the past thirty years. Consumer was about the physical -  food, beverages, media and entertainment. But eventually, the internet offered a digital business model for everything physical. Consumers now access virtually any product or service with a few clicks. Consumer brands have vastly expanded their distribution and business economics due to the internet.\n\nSo what will define the next consumer transformation? Crypto. There are 3 major reasons why crypto is poised to do this:\n\n**Ownership**\n\nCrypto enables ownership from day one-- a powerful concept. For the first time, users can partake in the growth and success of the products and communities they are a part of, from the beginning. Ownership changes the model from extractive to additive. The main mechanism for ownership has been via tokens - whether they are fungible or non-fungible. Tokens offer users the ability to partake in governance, access user benefits, and more. Tokens turn users into advocates. Each additional user in a given network benefits alongside the entire network. Rather than providing content, time, attention for free, they are rewarded for making products and services successful.\n\n**24/7 Markets**\n\nSecond, is the nature of crypto markets. Crypto never sleeps. Similar to how the internet trained millions of users to fast instant community, 2-day delivery, and simple UX, crypto will train users to expect 24/7 markets. The past decade has seen exchanges like Coinbase and Binance grow a user base that’s come to expect 24/7 global markets. DeFi is accessible to anyone with an internet connection. We’re now taking this to the next level by making the internet ownable. Marketplaces like [OpenSea](https://opensea.com) provide exposure to non-fungible tokens at any time of day. Consumers are shifting expectations to meet this cadence.\n\n**Open Access**\n\nLastly, a defining pillar for crypto is around open global access. The internet turned e-commerce, advertising, and media into global all-consuming models. Advertisers are able to personalize and target users while social media launched the influencer career model. However, the beneficiaries of the internet continue to be limited to a smaller set of stakeholders. Geographical constraints will continue to fall away, giving users opportunities to work and play online in manners that weren’t previously available. The focus is now on the long tail of creators and communities.\n\n### But isn’t everything “Consumer”\n\nThe first decade of crypto was about finding our footing. We saw the highs and lows of an emerging asset class and a (still developing) smart contract ecosystem.\n\nWe still have a long way to go when it comes to scaling, infrastructure, and user experiences. But, I’m certain that we’re reached a point where narratives and stories will allow us to scale.\n\nUntil we shift away from our past shadows, it’ll be challenging to resonate with what’s to come. What’s better than telling? Showing.\n\nOver the next decade, we’ll start to see bottoms-up brands, business model reinvention, and community ownership take off. The consumer category in crypto will create opportunities we haven’t even thought of yet. The outcome, I hope, will be one that is fairer and more equitable to all participants.\n\nThe old rules do not apply and I’m excited to be a part of the new playbook. To make this more real, here are 5 breakout categories I’m watching:\n\n**1 | Curation-as-a-Service**\n\nThe internet made it so we are all consumers, creators and curators. As we are constantly reminded in our online lives - we are the product. Curation implies taste, and requires effort and skill to do so correctly. But that being said, we are all curators. We curate with our likes. We curate with our comments. We also curate via promotion. Sharing within our network and beyond. While the internet has created a business model around affiliate programs and links, ultimately, the curation space remains relatively [untapped.](https://gaby.mirror.xyz/LGrzJJbwV9ewhYAa7gcFYa2nxYlTWRH-SxmSuViEWA4)\n\n![Yup ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/555afede-69d8-442f-9809-d5559abc8d2d.png?height=1332&width=2152)\n\nWeb3 offers an opportunity to curate with clear financial incentives *and* social status. What once took place across blogs and newsletters will soon find ways to curate where you can tip creators, earn money via curation, and create massive economic graphs. For example, Yup, is a curation protocol that provides an opportunity for users to curate and build their influence accordingly. Collector DAOs are curating NFT investments and making a bet on the future success of these projects. Curation-focused products allow digital content to become organized irrespective of the platform it lives on. Social token design can create a system where users earn for curating content and split the benefits with both the curators and creators. Being early has always had value, but web3 allows you to benefit from it.\n\nNotable projects: [Yup](http://yup.io), [Bitclout](https://bitclout.com/), [Verse](https://neuroswish.mirror.xyz/2IlOa5B-eMCuSMTGjYq4lsdPRzOwqqIqy9XzHycsmrY)\n\n**2 | Social DAOs**\n\nSocial DAOs are [tokens backed by the reputation of an individual, brand, or community.](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-bull-case-for-social-tokens) These DAOs typically have the following structure: a shared mission or purpose, a strong community, and tokenized ownership. Web3, and more specifically tokenized incentives, allow for social communities to quantify their value and share in the upside.\n\n![FWB Dashboard](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8bfde67-be38-4c64-9b40-33a1817c1c34.png?height=1370&width=2878)\n\nToday, there are a few dozens of social token DAOs, with FWB taking center stage as the leading player. FWB, Friends with Benefits, provides a window into some of the coolest creators and thinkers in Web3. Together they’ve created a digital space that fosters conversation and translates that into digital and IRL events, editorial content and more. Infrastructure providers like Rally and Coinvise are providing the tools to allow these social token communities to thrive, with token infrastructure as well as creator support. It’s still early days for social token DAOs but I’m bullish this category will grow extensively in the coming decades.\n\nNotable projects: [FWB](https://www.fwb.help/), [Coinvise](https://www.coinvise.co/), [Rally](https://rally.io/)\n\n**3 | Play-to-Earn Games**\n\nPlay-to-earn games are the newest gaming business model to take the spotlight. Although the model has been for decades, blockchain applications are unlocking ways to earn and own in-game assets. Virtual in-game assets are plentiful but are confined to a one-way economy, where game publishers create and users buy. Despite spending millions on virtual assets, users ultimately have no ownership rights over these assets. With the play-to-earn category, users are working within games to earn in-game assets in the form of NFTs, tokens or otherwise. As more people play the game, the collective value increases while benefiting users. This introduces digital property rights, two-way markets, and in-game scarcity.\n\n![Axie Infinity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c314e7dc-605b-44d0-be25-4c1bf31071a0.png?height=576&width=1024)\n\nAxie Infinity is the most popular play-to-earn game in the blockchain world, with nearly [$500M](https://www.tokenterminal.com/) in protocol revenue generated to date. Yield Guild Games, is an organization of players, who all play games where they can earn in-game currency or assets. Play-to-earn games allow users to participate in the upside while growing the games they enjoy playing.\n\nNotable projects: [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), [YGG](https://yieldguild.io/)\n\n**4 | Digital Spaces & Showcases**\n\n![JPG Gallery](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c34387ee-1761-4b15-a651-d07a8e561acc.png?height=668&width=1352)\n\nNFTs are a tool. They allow users to tell a story, share context, collaborate, raise funding and more. As NFTs become increasingly popular, the next question arises - where do we put them? As the concept of the metaverse takes off, I’m interested in digital spaces and showcases where users can share their NFTs, socialize with others and build deeper connections. Whether it is about incorporating virtual reality (like CryptoVoxels), developing museum style exhibits (JPG Gallery) or combining the physical and digital (CryptoVenetians) there are significant opportunities to explore.\n\nNotable projects: **[CryptoVoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/), [Super Rare Spaces](https://twitter.com/SuperRare/status/1430199846464536577), [CryptoVenetians](https://www.cryptovenetians.com/), [Gallery](https://gallery.so/), [JPG](https://jpg.space/)**\n\n**5 | Bottoms Up Brands**\n\nI’m fascinated by the concept of bottoms up brands. I define bottoms up brands as community driven, mission-oriented brands with distributed IP. This could be a particular type of PFP and the IP around it, products like PartyDAO or entertainment like Crypto Punk Comics. We’re in a world where communities are crowdsourcing product roadmaps, DAOs are spinning up to support a particular project and IP is becoming decentralized.

Here’s what’s happening:**\n\n**Prices:** Bitcoin gains slightly in weekend trading but can't break much beyond $30,000; ether and other major cryptos are in the green.\n\n**Insights:** Terra's post-collapse path will be difficult.\n\n**Technician's take:** BTC is roughly flat over the past week.

But in the larger picture, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was still deep in a bear market with no end in sight, and struggling to hover above the $30,000 support line it has held for the past 10 days.\n\nBTC was recently trading at approximately $30,370, a roughly 3.3% rise from its ending point Friday. Ether, the second largest crypto by market cap, was up similarly over the same period and holding just over $2,000 – its perch for much of the past few weeks. AVAX was among the big winners, recently rising more than 8%. SOL and TRX were both up over 5%.\n\n\"Bitcoin managed to retain the support levels it found last week and even attempted range breakouts,\" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital wrote to CoinDesk. \"However, $31K-$32K remains a strong resistance level \\[that\\] Bitcoin needs to successfully breach before we can look toward more upside.\"\n\nInvestors alarmed by central banking missteps to tame inflation, the ongoing economic fall-out from Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the increasing likelihood of recession have veered away from riskier assets, including digital currencies and stocks since last fall.\n\nTo be sure, equity markets ended their Friday with a surge, but all that did was help the S&P 500 escape the bear market territory where it lingered for much of the day. The S&P, which bitcoin has tracked increasingly in recent months, closed flat after spending the morning and afternoon in the red. Indices earn bear market designation when they are off 20% from their previous highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which crypto markets have tracked increasingly, rallied late to also hold its ground from the previous day, as did The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Still, the DJIA declined for the eighth consecutive week, its longest weekly losing streak since the Great Depression. Each of the indices fell 2.9% or more for the week.\n\nTech stocks have led the ongoing declines with Apple and Meta Platform's (formerly Facebook) share price dropping 22% and 42% since the start of the year. But the retail sector, which fueled a large part of the economic recovery in 2021 and early 2022, has now also showed signs of weakening with Walmart, Target and Kohl's underperforming on their most recent earnings. \"Households are feeling the effects of higher prices everywhere,\" First Republic Bank said in a note to investors, adding that \"markets will remain under pressure with significant bouts of equity and bond volatility persisting as investors digest a regime shift toward tighter policy intended to slow inflation.\"\n\nDiPasquale noted cautiously that crypto markets \"had yet to see strong buying action, the kind that is typically indicative of a proper reversal,\" and that BitBull has \"plans for both positive and negative price action from here.\"\n\n## Markets\n\nS&P 500: 3,901 +0.01%\n\nDJIA: 31,261 +0.02%\n\nNasdaq: 11,354 -0.3%\n\nGold: $1,846 +0.2%\n\n## Insights\n\n**Terra's difficult post-collapse path**\n\nAs the rubble is swept up after Terra’s collapse, some investors are sorting through it for pieces on which to rebuild, while other investors are posting *mea culpas* or trying to back away from the project entirely. At the same time, experts are warning that regulators will use this implosion as a need for comprehensive stablecoin regulation.\n\nOn [Terra’s governance proposal portal](https://station.terra.money/proposal/1623), 80% of eligible token holders that voted are pushing to rebuild the protocol — minus the algorithmic component.\n\nTerra’s dozen or so investors have plenty of incentive to support this. The losses from their gamble on the protocol are astronomical.\n\nGalaxy Digital’s (GLXY.TO) Mike Novogratz has spoken about the need for a [post-LUNA redemption cycle](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/18/mike-novogratz-ends-twitter-silence-gives-take-on-ustluna-crash/). Delphi Digital [said it](https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/learnings-from-last-week) “always knew something like this was possible..\\[but\\] miscalculated the risk of a 'death spiral.'” [Hashed has stayed silent](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/19/terra-backers-delphi-digital-and-hashed-lick-their-wounds-after-ust-and-luna-collapse/) about its gargantuan loss.\n\nDeFiance Capital, another investor, briefly removed the LUNA logo from its website ([the Internet Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20220509172556/https://www.defiance.capital/) says that happened after May 9), though founding partner Arthur Cheong said that “it was removed accidentally when we redesigned the layout, and it will be added back.” Convenient timing, indeed, and nothing like Three Arrow Capital’s Su Zhu deleting boosterish tweets for the Terra ecosystem[ because of a misclick](https://twitter.com/zhusu/status/1525048630079590400).\n\nWhen the rubble clears, what’s going to happen? Regulation, says Yves Longchamp, the head of research at Swiss digital asset bank SEBA.\n\n“I have always been skeptical about algorithmic stablecoins. At SEBA we don’t offer any algorithmic stablecoins; I believe you can’t create stability out of the blue,” he told CoinDesk in an interview. “You need to have an underlying asset.”\n\nLongchamp thinks that if stablecoins are here to stay, regulation is a must because there were some UST holders that had good faith in the project and were not aware of the underlying risks.\n\nRegulators should discourage the use of algorithmically backed stablecoins, he says, by giving ones with sound backing a green light via a regulatory framework.\n\nAfter all, with USDC, it's well known what’s behind it. Stablecoin tether (USDT) has worked so far because the redemption requests for USDT have been successful, but it's still unclear what’s behind it.\n\nBut with algorithmic stablecoins like UST, the problem, he says, is that dollars are created at no cost. It's not like USDC where you park a dollar to issue a dollar.\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) and “stablecoins are right now going through what has been learned in the 19th century in the banking system, which at the end of the day, led to the rise of central banking,” he said.\n\nBut while banks like SEBA welcome regulation, and it would have likely prevented Do Kwon from imploding the market and forcing regulators down on the ecosystem, is this what the industry wants? Will venture capitalists, as hurt as they are with the hit on their balance sheets, think regulation gets in the way of their 100x returns?\n\n## Technician's take\n\n**[Bitcoin Drifts Lower, Support at $25K-$27K](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/20/bitcoin-drifts-lower-support-at-25k-27k/)**\n\n*Bitcoin weekly chart shows support/resistance (Damanick Dantes/CoinDesk, TradingView)*\n\nBitcoin ([BTC](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/)) continues to struggle around the lower end of a yearlong trading range.

But in the larger picture, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was still deep in a bear market with no end in sight, and struggling to hover above the $30,000 support line it has held for the past 10 days.\n\nBTC was recently trading at approximately $30,370, a roughly 3.3% rise from its ending point Friday. Ether, the second largest crypto by market cap, was up similarly over the same period and holding just over $2,000 – its perch for much of the past few weeks. AVAX was among the big winners, recently rising more than 8%. SOL and TRX were both up over 5%.\n\n\"Bitcoin managed to retain the support levels it found last week and even attempted range breakouts,\" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital wrote to CoinDesk. \"However, $31K-$32K remains a strong resistance level \\[that\\] Bitcoin needs to successfully breach before we can look toward more upside.\"\n\nInvestors alarmed by central banking missteps to tame inflation, the ongoing economic fall-out from Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the increasing likelihood of recession have veered away from riskier assets, including digital currencies and stocks since last fall.\n\nTo be sure, equity markets ended their Friday with a surge, but all that did was help the S&P 500 escape the bear market territory where it lingered for much of the day. The S&P, which bitcoin has tracked increasingly in recent months, closed flat after spending the morning and afternoon in the red. Indices earn bear market designation when they are off 20% from their previous highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which crypto markets have tracked increasingly, rallied late to also hold its ground from the previous day, as did The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Still, the DJIA declined for the eighth consecutive week, its longest weekly losing streak since the Great Depression. Each of the indices fell 2.9% or more for the week.\n\nTech stocks have led the ongoing declines with Apple and Meta Platform's (formerly Facebook) share price dropping 22% and 42% since the start of the year. But the retail sector, which fueled a large part of the economic recovery in 2021 and early 2022, has now also showed signs of weakening with Walmart, Target and Kohl's underperforming on their most recent earnings. \"Households are feeling the effects of higher prices everywhere,\" First Republic Bank said in a note to investors, adding that \"markets will remain under pressure with significant bouts of equity and bond volatility persisting as investors digest a regime shift toward tighter policy intended to slow inflation.\"\n\nDiPasquale noted cautiously that crypto markets \"had yet to see strong buying action, the kind that is typically indicative of a proper reversal,\" and that BitBull has \"plans for both positive and negative price action from here.\"\n\n## Markets\n\nS&P 500: 3,901 +0.01%\n\nDJIA: 31,261 +0.02%\n\nNasdaq: 11,354 -0.3%\n\nGold: $1,846 +0.2%\n\n## Insights\n\n**Terra's difficult post-collapse path**\n\nAs the rubble is swept up after Terra’s collapse, some investors are sorting through it for pieces on which to rebuild, while other investors are posting *mea culpas* or trying to back away from the project entirely. At the same time, experts are warning that regulators will use this implosion as a need for comprehensive stablecoin regulation.\n\nOn [Terra’s governance proposal portal](https://station.terra.money/proposal/1623), 80% of eligible token holders that voted are pushing to rebuild the protocol — minus the algorithmic component.\n\nTerra’s dozen or so investors have plenty of incentive to support this. The losses from their gamble on the protocol are astronomical.\n\nGalaxy Digital’s (GLXY.TO) Mike Novogratz has spoken about the need for a [post-LUNA redemption cycle](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/18/mike-novogratz-ends-twitter-silence-gives-take-on-ustluna-crash/). Delphi Digital [said it](https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/learnings-from-last-week) “always knew something like this was possible..\\[but\\] miscalculated the risk of a 'death spiral.'” [Hashed has stayed silent](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/19/terra-backers-delphi-digital-and-hashed-lick-their-wounds-after-ust-and-luna-collapse/) about its gargantuan loss.\n\nDeFiance Capital, another investor, briefly removed the LUNA logo from its website ([the Internet Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20220509172556/https://www.defiance.capital/) says that happened after May 9), though founding partner Arthur Cheong said that “it was removed accidentally when we redesigned the layout, and it will be added back.” Convenient timing, indeed, and nothing like Three Arrow Capital’s Su Zhu deleting boosterish tweets for the Terra ecosystem[ because of a misclick](https://twitter.com/zhusu/status/1525048630079590400).\n\nWhen the rubble clears, what’s going to happen? Regulation, says Yves Longchamp, the head of research at Swiss digital asset bank SEBA.\n\n“I have always been skeptical about algorithmic stablecoins. At SEBA we don’t offer any algorithmic stablecoins; I believe you can’t create stability out of the blue,” he told CoinDesk in an interview. “You need to have an underlying asset.”\n\nLongchamp thinks that if stablecoins are here to stay, regulation is a must because there were some UST holders that had good faith in the project and were not aware of the underlying risks.\n\nRegulators should discourage the use of algorithmically backed stablecoins, he says, by giving ones with sound backing a green light via a regulatory framework.\n\nAfter all, with USDC, it's well known what’s behind it. Stablecoin tether (USDT) has worked so far because the redemption requests for USDT have been successful, but it's still unclear what’s behind it.\n\nBut with algorithmic stablecoins like UST, the problem, he says, is that dollars are created at no cost. It's not like USDC where you park a dollar to issue a dollar.\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) and “stablecoins are right now going through what has been learned in the 19th century in the banking system, which at the end of the day, led to the rise of central banking,” he said.\n\nBut while banks like SEBA welcome regulation, and it would have likely prevented Do Kwon from imploding the market and forcing regulators down on the ecosystem, is this what the industry wants? Will venture capitalists, as hurt as they are with the hit on their balance sheets, think regulation gets in the way of their 100x returns?\n\n## Technician's take\n\n**[Bitcoin Drifts Lower, Support at $25K-$27K](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/20/bitcoin-drifts-lower-support-at-25k-27k/)**\n\n*Bitcoin weekly chart shows support/resistance (Damanick Dantes/CoinDesk, TradingView)*\n\nBitcoin ([BTC](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/)) continues to struggle around the lower end of a yearlong trading range.

It is authoritative, professional, timely and comprehensive to help you tap the potential theme opportunities!\n\nOn the strategy of people’s livelihood\n\nSummary\n\nabstract\n\nThe trend is endless, and the real cycle is beginning\n\nThis week, the market value style and cycle sector outperformed significantly, the main line of inflation gradually surfaced, and our “real cycle” is gradually becoming a “new consensus” in the market. What we mentioned in the layout of the real cycle: the real cycle market has never taken steady growth as the cornerstone, nor the supply-demand gap caused by sanctions against Russia as the underlying logic. The real cycle is actually the co vibration of “green inflation” and “population reversal”, which has brought greater supply shock inflation, Overseas central banks, which are good at dealing with short-term credit fluctuations, lack effective measures to balance inflation and growth, which is impacting the credit monetary system of major countries in the world, resulting in the appreciation of physical assets relative to overseas credit currencies. Steady growth and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine are only the catalyst at both ends of supply and demand, not the essence of the problem.\n\n 2. After the government work report of the “two sessions”, the rise of global commodity prices was further clarified\n 3. From a domestic perspective, the government work report released on Saturday set a target of 5.5% year-on-year growth of GDP in 2022, which is at the top of the market expectation, higher than the consensus expectation of Wande analysts (5.32%) and higher than the previously generally expected target of 5%. This confirms what we have repeatedly mentioned: the difference in real interest rates between China and the United States gives us more room to exchange the rise of inflation for the recovery of demand. We are also concerned about the uncertainty of means and space in achieving the 5.5% target. Therefore, the future of the sector that depends on the growth elasticity of volume is relatively vague, but the elasticity of future inflation that can be determined may be much stronger than the economic demand itself. A corroboration is that in the fourth quarter of 2021, when the economy is in recession, the 120 day moving average of Nanhua industrial products index is still not retreated, and the index hit a record high when demand began to bottom out and pick up recently.\n 4. Investors who are bearish on commodity prices with the Fed’s “interest rate hike” need logical self consistency\n 5. If investors believe that this round of interest rate hike is consistent with the law in the economic cycle over the past 20 years, the historical law shows that in the early stage of interest rate hike, global commodity prices are also in the rising channel. Even in the whole interest rate hike cycle, commodities are often the best performing assets. If investors believe that this round of demand is not strong and more like “stagflation”, the experience of the United States in the 1970s tells us that in the face of supply shocks, the central bank, which is good at handling short-term credit cycle fluctuations, is difficult to respond effectively to the initial supply inflation, which eventually leads to a positive feedback mechanism for inflation expectations, The concern about the value of credit money has led to a widespread and irresistible rise in the price of physical assets in the whole society. On the contrary, inflation is more difficult to be solved in the easing of supply contradiction and the rise of interest rate in the early stage. More studies also show that the United States out of the “stagflation quagmire” is not entirely due to ultra tight monetary policy, and factors such as technology and the influx of immigrants also play a crucial role. At present, the good luck of the “great easing” era opened by major developed countries after the 1980s is running out.\n 6. 4 compared with September 2021: the cycle “flowers” are similar, but “people” are very different\n 7. Some investors are worried that the rise of cyclical stocks this time will lead to a sharp decline after the sharp rise in August and September 2021. The reality is that it is the lesson from August to September that makes a large number of investors lack participation: from the perspective of transaction heat (represented by the ratio of daily average turnover to free circulation market value), there is still a lot of gap compared with August and September 2021; At present, the participation of equity funds in most cyclical sectors (based on the calculation of net worth correlation) is also much lower than that in August and September 2021; The two financial investors with the most trend trading characteristics did not even show their enthusiasm in September 2021. When our cognition is forming a “new consensus”, we are actually more “cautious” than investors in the whole market, but we still see a better opportunity for participation behind the current similar stock price performance than that from August to September: China is now at a low position in the economic cycle rather than a high decline; After investors learned the lessons at that time, the whole market did not appear “overheating” and crowded trading. In the face of the irresistible global inflation trend, investors should recognize that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is only a periodic contradiction, and the market is far from over. If the market retreats due to the geographical situation, it is a good opportunity to enter the market.\n 8. 5 “new main line that can’t wait” and “real cycle”\n 9. Some wait-and-see investors are still waiting for a new main line in the market, but in fact, the new main line in the market has been established and the real cycle is beginning. We understand the underlying logic of investors’ concerns about assets that “rely on price judgment”: in the past, the inflation center moved down, and the best price judgment strategy is to avoid such assets. However, the environment has been changing, the upward movement of inflation center has been established, and the appreciation path of physical assets is very obvious. Therefore, avoiding assets relying on price judgment should not be a wise choice, and the inertial thinking needs to be broken. Under the deflationary environment in the past, it was customary to think that “high-quality” assets also need to be judged again, and the main line of “hard waiting” of some investors may leave for a long time. At present, our recommended order is: inflation transaction is the most certain, buying nonferrous metals (copper, aluminum, gold), crude oil (oil transportation, oil and gas mining) and coal; the probability of demand recovery is increasing, and the layout: banks, real estate and construction.\n10. Risk tip: the implementation of steady growth policy is less than expected, and overseas imported inflation is higher than expected.\n11. Report body\n12. 1. The trend is endless, and the main line of inflation is gradually determined\n13. This week, the market value style and cycle sector outperformed significantly, and the main line of inflation gradually surfaced. Some investors attributed it to the gradual force of steady growth, geopolitical problems such as the conflict between overseas Russia and Ukraine and the gap between supply and demand of energy. Indeed, the above inference is supported by some practical evidence. For example, China’s PMI performance is super seasonal upward, and there are relevant large-scale problems after the overweight of European and American sanctions against Russia\n14.

Tao Jingying comforted her", "body": "Xie Yilin takes a group photo with his mother\n\nSina entertainment news according to Taiwan media reports on the 12th, Xie Yilin \\[microblog\\] wrote a long article on the social platform on the 8th to expose the growth process. Tao Jingying \\[microblog\\] comforted in the comment area after reading it. Xie Yilin said bluntly in his article that “my mother is a mental illness”. He once saved his mother who tried to commit suicide several times. When he was young, he thought “this must be a stepmother” and imagined what kind of person the real mother is. When he grew up, he began to find a way to get along with her and now he tries to understand her.\n\nXie Yilin wrote a composition titled “my mother”. She admitted that her mother was suffering from depression, bipolar disorder and panic disorder. When she was a child, she was often asked to do housework and fantasized that “although everyone didn’t say it, I knew in my heart that this must be a stepmother. The real mother was gentle, fat and earthy”. When she grew up, she recognized the fact: “this crazy woman, she is my biological mother.” Although she often felt abused or saw her mother beating her father late at night, Xie Yilin always comforted herself that she was not targeted, and her mother’s personality extended to her campus life. When she fought with her neighbors when she was a child, her mother went to the next door to yell and scold, her sister wrote her homework to cry, and her mother rushed to school. And whenever the shift director changes, my mother will write “teacher, Yilin is very naughty. Please educate her (below the neck) thank you” in the contact book.\n\nIn addition, the mother suffering from mental illness has done stupid things several times: “I arrived when the rope was tied up when hanging. As soon as I came home, I found traces of charcoal burning (but she didn’t check that the fire was strong enough to fall asleep, and the fire only burned a little and went out). She took a knife to cut my father, and my sister just rushed over and grabbed the white blade with empty hands. It was so dangerous every time.”\n\nXie Yilin admitted that the whole family had a melancholy tendency. When her mother looked strange, she would peek at her diary in case of regret, but once saw: “today is Yilin’s birthday on March 19. I took her to buy clothes. I hope my children will always be happy.” She burst into tears. She once hated her mother so much. When she grew up, she began to understand mental illness and face it together. Her mother also began to change with action. “I’m no longer persistent. I always want to change her and complain about her. I try to empathize with her and listen to her. Even if I don’t agree with her, don’t deny her, because you’re not her and you can’t feel the feelings of others.” Xie Yilin chose to write down the journey of growth on Mother’s day, While sending a happy mother’s day, I also lamented that “happiness has always been blessed. It can be seen that it is really a difficult thing for him, but try to go in this direction. Mom, I love you. I know that as long as I say I love you, you will be happy”.\n\nAfter reading Xie Yilin’s article, Tao Jingying knew that each other’s growth process was so hard, and then encouraged and comforted “sometimes, everyone works too hard… Relax, dear lovely you. Hug”.", "timestamp": 1653259662, "digest": "AEo0y-p4u_EiU-uzyFOl6Y90lXouA6rkJvh3mZ3L31M", "contributor": "0x7AF94F36972AD4Da2D60A6606A57695c5A8FcE66"}

It is an amplifier to push further when the market is up and press intensely when the market is down.\n\nIt has nothing to do about the cryptocurrency itself.\n\nLike investment collectible, its valuation solely depends on supply and demand. The higher the price is because people are willing to pay such price, not because such collectible has a fundamental value to support its price.\n\nThe same argument applies to cryptocurrencies. People are willing to purchase at a higher price because they can afford it, not because cryptocurrencies are unique to reflect their valuation.\n\nThe only reason that cryptocurrencies are valuable is that people continue to speculate their price will go higher no matter what. It is a continuation of the speculation cycle that will carry out once the market is uptrend again.\n\nShould you ride with the wave and avoid becoming a bagholder before the downward trend happens 🥺?\n\nHow do a regular investor like you and I see the wave of crypto and avoid becoming a bagholder eventually?\n\nHere are some of the insights I believe can help each investor to access their own portfolios:\n\n**1️⃣ Don't day trading crypto**\n\nDay trading crypto is just not sustainable in the crypto investment. You will lose the ability to join the extreme upward trend and become a highly likely a bagholder because you are regretting the previous trend.\n\nYou will be lost because psychologically and emotionally, impulse trading rather than proper investing in crypto.\n\n**2️⃣ Don't try to predict the market**\n\nYou will waste your time predicting the market. The market can only provide feedback for investors' short-term decision makings. It does not give you long-term feedback. Such asymmetrical feedback increases your chance of losing in the long term, even if you got several short-term winnings. There is no real bottom or really top if your investment is long-term.\n\n**3️⃣ Don't sell easily**\n\nDon't sell your positions even if the market is down by 90%! Yes, if you do not sell, you do not lose anything.\n\n**4️⃣ Always be skeptical**\n\nCrypto is risky because of its nature of speculation. Always be skeptical about the crypto market.\n\n**5️⃣ Passive investment strategy wins in the long term**\n\nDon't try to beat the market! Invest less emotionally and keep caution about your portfolios while consistently investing is a key to survival in the long term.\n\n**6️⃣ Investment is a survival game**\n\nThinking about how you will survive with limited food and water on the isolated island. This is how crypto investment should be. You are managing to survive each time when harsh weather conditions hit the island. Your goal is to survive and to prepare for the next harsh weather to come.\n\n[https://twitter.com/TimmerFidelity/status/1526203433484681217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1526203433484681217%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.iframe.ly%2Fapi%2Fiframe%3Furl%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2FTimmerFidelity2Fstatus2F1526203433484681217v%3D1app%3D1api_key%3Df11b9fe9d88a3d54bbc74aiframe%3D1](https://twitter.com/TimmerFidelity/status/1526203433484681217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1526203433484681217%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.iframe.ly%2Fapi%2Fiframe%3Furl%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2FTimmerFidelity2Fstatus2F1526203433484681217v%3D1app%3D1api_key%3Df11b9fe9d88a3d54bbc74aiframe%3D1)\n\n \n You may think, yeah right, all chicken soup ideas cure me shortly, but how am I going to invest in the crypto market in the long term?\n\nHere are some of the suggestions:\n\n**1️⃣ Dollar-cost averaging**\n\nYeah, it is super boring, and everyone knows the idea, but only a few consistently follow the strategy. Be more specifically, invest the money you are willing to lose rather than over-investing to create an emotional burden.\n\n**2️⃣ Don't be creative**\n\nYou heard me. Everything you came up with may have already been tested and proved to be a fail. Otherwise, such a strategy will be widely used and successfully beat a market a long time ago. Try to become as boring as possible to investing in crypto.\n\n**3️⃣ Don't invest ideas**\n\nMany crypto projects just sound so wonderful to resolve every issue like a silver bullet. Don't invest! You have no idea about the project at all because you did not work on it. Buying an idea is to buy an empty check with a promise to pay off god knows when.\n\n**4️⃣ Don't feel at a loss, don't invest**\n\nIt is better to enjoy the drama than invest in the drama. Investing if you will lead to losing the whole investment.\n\n**5️⃣ Plan to invest for the next 30 years**\n\nAll investment that people share in media is a short-term successes.

What does Li Ning want to do?", "body": "Recently, the domestic coffee market has been very lively. Here, Xiang Ruixing has just come to life, and there, Xiang Starbucks has broken down in China. However, when you see the eight immortals of the major coffee giants crossing the sea, there is another new news. Is Li Ning going to sell coffee? A sports brand sells coffee? What the hell does Li Ning want?\n\n1、 Li Ning is selling coffee, too?\n\nAccording to Forbes China, tianyancha shows that Li Ning, a well-known sports brand, has applied to register the trademark of “Ning coffee”, which has become a hot spot of venture capital in the near future.\n\nOn the tianyancha app page, “Ning coffee” shows that Li Ning Sports (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. applied for registration, which is internationally classified as catering and accommodation, and the current trademark status is awaiting substantive review. For the barbaric growth of the coffee track in recent years, this undoubtedly marks the arrival of a new competitor.\n\nAccording to the report of Southern Metropolis Daily, relevant personnel of Li Ning told the reporter of nanduwan finance agency that Li Ning company pays attention to the consumer purchase experience of retail terminals and hopes to improve the comfort and experience of customers during shopping by optimizing in store services. “Providing coffee service in the store will be an innovative attempt of Li Ning for the retail terminal consumption experience.”\n\nAs for when the store will sell coffee, Li Ning said there is no official information.\n\nAccording to industry data, the scale of China’s coffee market in 2021 is about 381.7 billion yuan. As of May 2021, since 2013, coffee projects have been financed 114 times, with a total disclosure amount of RMB 11.568 billion. The market scale of China’s coffee industry is expected to maintain a growth rate of 27.2%, much higher than the global average growth rate of 2%. The market scale of China will reach 100 billion yuan in 2025. The low entry threshold, relatively simple operation mode and high gross profit margin make the coffee market popular in the cold of new consumption.\n\nAs of March 31, 2022, the number of sales points of Li Ning in the Chinese market (excluding Li Ning young) totaled 5872, accounting for ultra-high private domain traffic and brand advantages. In 2020, Li Ning’s marketing expenses (advertising and marketing expenses) were 1.28 billion yuan, and 68 million traffic was obtained in one hour. With its brand image and cross-border novelty, “Ning coffee” is undoubtedly a good card for Li Ning to catch young people and catch the traffic express.\n\nLi Ning is not the first cross-border brand to enter the coffee industry. Before that, China Post, PetroChina and Sinopec have long been well-known cross-border players in the coffee market. In addition to coffee, China Post’s post coffee also sells tea, desserts and around the post office. With the sales of nearly 1000 cups on the opening day, it has become the first popular local coffee. Sinopec’s Yijie coffee is named after the gasoline model. Up to now, it has opened 21 stores, which are ridiculed as “petroleum coffee” by netizens.\n\n2、 Here comes Ning coffee? What does Li Ning want to do?\n\nIn fact, it’s not a particularly surprising thing for Li Ning to enter the coffee market at this time. What should we think of it?\n\nFirst of all, coffee is indeed a very suitable market for cross-border money. In fact, looking at the development of the coffee industry in recent years, we will find that coffee has almost become the common choice of many enterprises. From the earliest time that China Merchants Bank laid out coffee in its own golden sunflower outlet, there are news of cross-border coffee of enterprises almost every once in a while, from familiar bank coffee, postal coffee, petroleum coffee and so on. Of course, there was milk tea before, but with the weakness of new tea enterprises, coffee gradually occupied the C position of the market again? Why coffee? As we said before, there is a lot of room for the development of the coffee market, and the market growth rate of China’s coffee industry is also very high. Therefore, from the growth rate of the coffee market, it seems that choosing coffee is in the past, but this is only in the past. For current enterprises, the reason for choosing coffee is not just the growth rate of the coffee market. We can analyze it in detail:\n\nFirst, coffee is indeed an addictive drug. Whether we admit it or not, in the more than 1000 years since it was discovered, coffee can relieve fatigue in a short time due to its main component caffeine. In addition, caffeine has certain addictive characteristics. Everyone’s consumption of coffee has been increasing, and in a sense, this improvement still has a spreading trend. Therefore, under such circumstances, China’s coffee consumption audience is growing. For the current urban white-collar workers, a cup of coffee every afternoon has almost become everyone’s consensus.\n\nSecond, the function of coffee is not just coffee. The refreshing effect of coffee is only a small part of its efficacy. For most enterprises, entering coffee is not as simple as selling a cup of beverage. Since Starbucks created the concept of third space, the extension of coffee has been expanding. In most urban coffee markets, people’s demand for coffee is not just a drink, but a service, For busy urban white-collar workers, drinking a cup of coffee can not only improve, but also provide a place for a short rest after rush work. Therefore, the current extension of coffee has more become an integral part of a service. Most enterprises sell not only coffee but services.\n\nThird, coffee has become the key to attracting traffic in offline scenes. When the post office coffee appeared before, we were talking about drinking a cup of coffee in the post office, a place full of “bourgeois” flavor, Experience “the sun has become slow in the past, and cars, horses and emails are slow “Pleasant. Not only that, a large number of bookstores have also introduced coffee into their own stores. Zhong shuge, Sisyphus bookstore and Chengpin bookstore are all examples of making coffee. In fact, both post offices, bookstores and gas stations have gradually figured out that coffee is just an introduction to better attract users to consume, so they should play cross-border.\n\nSecondly, does Li Ning’s cross-border coffee really have a play? I have to say, Li Ning plays coffee across the border", "timestamp": 1653263568, "digest": "vnpBtcnZL1Jm7m499NeHZfdSLhrn8rqxUdJFvMTULyg", "contributor": "0x9Ea4CaB464F80B54D3cc6Efd15465A81097c3e16"}

The author: the seventh stroke. It is reproduced by chuangyebang with authorization\n\nUsing miracles to describe Ruixing’s experience in the past three years may be a little exaggerated. However, it is not easy for a physical coffee chain brand to achieve crazy expansion and sharp increase in revenue during the epidemic, and all this also happened when the company’s brand image was damaged due to financial fraud.\n\nA few days ago, Sina Finance said that Ruixing coffee was considering listing in Hong Kong. Soon, Ruixing responded to the listing news.\n\nOn May 9, lkncy. US announced that the management of the company focused on providing excellent products and services to customers through the implementation of business strategy. The company remains committed to the U.S. capital market and strives to improve long-term value for shareholders. Ruixing coffee will continue to pay attention to the development of the capital market and evaluate all ways to provide value to stakeholders, but it does not seek to be listed in Hong Kong at present.\n\nAccording to another person familiar with the matter, Ruixing coffee, which is listed on the US stock powder market, is studying the plan to re list on Nasdaq, which may be carried out as soon as the end of this year.\n\nFrom the above information, Ruixing really has no intention of going back to Hong Kong for listing, but from another point of view, the news of Ruixing coffee’s return to Hong Kong for listing can be believed by the media and spread, which just shows that Ruixing is no longer the loser who is praised by everyone because of the fraud scandal - people begin to believe that it has the strength to re list.\n\nTime has passed, and the auspicious luck with infinite scenery has come back.\n\nRuixing’s development experience is enough as a business case. As the company that achieved IPO in the shortest time in the world, the chain coffee brand went public successfully 18 months after its establishment. Fortune and misfortune depend on. After experiencing the high point, Ruixing quickly fell, but miraculously rose rapidly.\n\nOn January 31, 2020, muddy water released an 89 page Research Report, pointing directly at the financial fraud of Ruixing coffee. Two months later, the three independent directors of Ruixing coffee disclosed that the company falsely increased sales by 2.2 billion yuan. Affected by this, the company’s share price plunged by 80%. On June 29, Ruixing coffee stock was officially suspended on Nasdaq for delisting.\n\nAt that time, even Ruixing’s internal employees began to doubt that the company might not work. But Ruixing seems to have found a solution. On December 17, 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said that Ruixing coffee agreed to pay a fine of $180 million to settle and resume the transaction.\n\nSeven days later, the first financial report submitted by the joint liquidator of Ruixing coffee to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands showed that the strategic focus of Ruixing coffee has shifted from rapid expansion to targeted expansion, as well as improving profitability and cash flow.\n\nIn fact, Guo Jin, the new head of Ruixing, started the plan to close loss making stores early in the morning. In May 2020, Ruixing coffee closed 80 stores in the Beijing market. As of November 30, 2020, the number of Ruixing coffee stores had decreased from 4507 to 3898.\n\nWhen Ruixing seems to be actively saving himself, Ruixing has an internal fight.\n\nOn January 3, 2021, a total of 31 vice presidents, general managers of all branches and core business executives of Ruixing coffee submitted a report letter to Dazheng capital (Ruixing’s largest capital) and the board of directors, collectively requesting the dismissal of Guo Jinyi, the current chairman and CEO of Ruixing coffee.\n\nThe reason for removal is:\n\n1、 Corruption, cheating through glove suppliers and damaging the interests of the company;\n\n2、 Abuse of power, eradicate dissidents, Party members and oppress dissidents.\n\nOn January 6, Guo Jinyi issued a letter from all staff to respond to the matter. Guo Jinyi believed that the report letter submitted by senior executives was organized and drafted by Lu Zhengyao and Qian Zhiya. Some of the employees involved did not know the truth and were coerced to sign. He said he had asked the board of directors to set up an investigation team.\n\nThen the matter was settled. No matter what the truth is, it is certain that Ruixing is not harmonious internally. With so many executives publicly questioning Guo Jinyi, his work in Ruixing may not be smooth.\n\nHowever, nothing could stop Ruixing from coming back from the dead.\n\nOn April 11 this year, Ruixing coffee announced that the company had completed the financial debt restructuring and completed the procedures in Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law; Positioning for long-term sustainable growth and profitability; The company is no longer subject to bankruptcy or bankruptcy proceedings in any jurisdiction.\n\nThis is a new beginning for Ruixing.\n\nIn terms of revenue, Ruixing has also made good achievements in the past two years\n\nRuixing coffee’s net revenue in 2020 was 4.033 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 33.3%; As of December 31, 2020, the cumulative number of trading customers of Ruixing coffee exceeded 64.9 million, compared with 40.6 million in the same period of last year.\n\nBy the third and fourth quarter of 2021, Ruixing’s financial report is more bright. The net profit in the third quarter of last year was RMB 5.46 billion, a year-on-year increase of RMB 10.26 billion, with a net profit of RMB 10.26 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the revenue of Ruixing coffee was 2.43 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 80.7%; The net profit was 921.3 million yuan.\n\nIn 2021, the revenue of Ruixing coffee was 7.965.3 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 97.5%; The net profit attributable to the parent company was 686 million yuan.\n\nIn terms of the number of stores, the net number of new stores opened by Ruixing coffee in 2021 was 1221, with a year-on-year increase of 25.4%. By the end of 2021, Ruixing coffee had 6024 stores.\n\nOn February 15 this year, Guo Jinyi, chairman and CEO of Ruixing coffee, issued an internal letter to 20000 employees of Ruixing. In the internal letter, Guo Jinyi pointed out that in January this year, Ruixing opened about 360 new stores, refreshing the record of Ruixing’s total number of stores in a single month. In 2018 and 2019, Ruixing’s average number of new stores per month was 172 and 208.7 respectively. This means that Ruixing has expanded faster than the most glorious period in the past.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the survival rate of Ruixing stores has not decreased due to the sharp increase in the number of stores opened. According to the data, the survival rate of Ruixing new stores opened for 12 months in 2019 accounted for 63%, while in 2021, this figure increased to 93%.\n\nIn terms of store turnover, 2", "timestamp": 1653263873, "digest": "0cT5ObrmdeXGs3LrQkQ-pwoLr_wngFvN3W6LT8wAfsY", "contributor": "0xb7E5e6204F27112E7eA50F27a2Cf1ABcf9B1bb0a"}

{"id": "JSM1DhOE4q0PWgEVIicwN54IE5IeO1D_ml9Ylt7NjrE", "title": "Tech deep-dive on web3 dApp development", "body": "During the last couple of months, I have been developing a sample web3 dApp project to learn:\n\n* How to develop Smart Contracts as backend for web3 dApp?\n* How to develop a VueJS based web3 dApp to interact with MetaMask wallet and Smart Contracts?\n* How to deploy Smart Contracts to multiple EVM-compliant blockchains?\n* What are the differences between different blockchains?\n\n## Use Cases\n\nThe sample dApp is called \"Decentralized Bookstore\", allowing anyone to sell/buy books using cryptocurrencies. A NFT is minted at the same time as the book is purchased. The user can import the NFT into MetaMask wallet, shown in tab “My Books”. Here are the main use cases and the related UX screenshots:\n\n* Sell Book: powered by Bookstore smart contract's sellBook method, a book owner sells \"Harry Potter\" at the website, setting the price at 0.05 ETH.\n\n![Sell Book - 1 of 4](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kHb9g9_PLIJtEkdmJ94FP.jpg?height=2208&width=1768)\n\n![Sell Book - 2 of 4](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vFfi6kS4Ore7UCordyw9A.jpg?height=2208&width=1768)\n\n![Sell Book - 3 of 4](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3llQ5sNd-Iwm2XHkzK605.jpg?height=2208&width=1768)\n\n![Sell Book - 3 of 4](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ymiyo18EGY1JMGE9aUv3f.jpg?height=2208&width=1768)\n\n* Buy Book: powered by Bookstore contract's buyBook method, another user purchases the book \"Harry Potter\", paying 0.05 ETH to the seller and receives an NFT as proof of purchase:\n\n![Buy Book - 1 of 4](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nSCtfKyzp40WLB8G8aJNn.jpg?height=2208&width=1768)\n\n![Buy Book - 2 of 4](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mBQ2tGHEmroTnD4wcIgwc.jpg?height=2208&width=1768)\n\n![Buy Book - 3 of 4](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QnPH08u24chcQ0c7DN96p.jpg?height=2208&width=1768)\n\n![Buy Book - 4 of 4](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BfBuU-Rg5JbPkKTVy_SlF.jpg?height=2208&width=1768)\n\n* Import NFT: the buyer imports the minted NFT into MetaMask wallet:\n\n![Import NFT - 1 of 4](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g17wDu4-crXJ9K30xZJ0O.jpg?height=2208&width=1768)\n\n![Import NFT - 2 of 4](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CvWWD2CIFBnVlAshIavDo.jpg?height=2208&width=1768)\n\n![Import NFT - 3 of 4](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rqYxkemhID7sWQd5_cNVL.jpg?height=2208&width=1768)\n\n![Import NFT - 4 of 4](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WQVbU9P5NV4lfVUXTO4zt.jpg?height=2289&width=840)\n\n## Application Architecture\n\n![The Architecture of a Web 3.0 application - created by Preethi Kasireddy](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ddd80927946cdaa0e71d607/614bb2efff06e818e12a57f2_Screen%20Shot%202021-09-22%20at%206.49.04%20PM.png)\n\nThe front-end is a Vue 3 based Single Page Application (SPA) which can be deployed to any server or IPFS as a static web site. After the SPA is loaded in browser, it interacts with the backend Bookstore smart contract which has been deployed to following blockchains:\n\n* Layer 1 (L1)\n  * Ropsten\n  * Rinkeby\n  * Kovan\n  * Goerli\n* Layer 2 (L2)\n  * Arbitrum Rinkeby\n  * Optimism Kovan\n* Sidechain\n  * Poloygon Mumbai\n  * Meter\n\n## Learnings & Know-hows\n\n### Comparison of Transaction Speed & Fee on Different Blockchains\n\nAs shown in the screenshots above, the dApp captures the transaction times and displays Etherscan links from which we can find out transaction fees. Here is a summary table to compare transaction speed & fee on different blockchains:\n\n![Comparison of 8 Blockchain Testnets](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Njkf5Mf6wHvjjX1NaNPbu.png?height=809&width=1353)\n\nFor any blockchain network, the transaction confirmation times and fees vary from time to time, depending on how busy the network is. The above table only provides some sense on the transaction speeds in different networks. During the development, I have observed the following:\n\n* Among tested L1 networks, Rinkeby and Kovan are generally faster than Ropsten and Goeli.\n  * As a PoW L1 network, Ropsten is usually slow. Sometimes the transaction confirmation can take more than 200 seconds.\n* Among tested L2 networks, Arbitrum Rinkeby testnet delivers very fast transaction speed, usually transaction can be confirmed within 1 second; while Optimism Kovan's transaction speed is similar to Kovan's, ie, 10+ seconds, its transaction fee is much lower than that of Arbitrum's (\\~ 1/56K)\n  * L1/L2 ethers can be exchanged at [Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/), [Optimism Bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge) or third party bridges.\n  * Deposit from L1 to L2 balance takes only couple of minutes, while withdraw from L2 to L1 balance will take \\~7 days to process\n    * This withdrawal waiting period is to allow time for fraud proofs to be submitted and maintain security of the network.\n    * To receive the funds on L1, the user must send a transaction on L1 which will incur a second transaction fee - see below a screenshot captured at Optimism Bridge:\n\n![L2 Balance Withdraw at Optimism Bridge ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lBYs_XvoSxuhCNQN42zkp.png?height=675&width=386)\n\n* Both sidechains (Ploygon Mumbai and MTR) deliver transaction speeds similar to L1 PoS blockchains\n\n### How to Deploy Smart Contract to Different Blockchains?\n\nWith an Infura developer account properly set up, we can set up package.json and truffle-config as below to deploy smart contracts to different blockchains:\n\n![Node/Truffle Config Files](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9BNgKK8a_5I7FhuwTaLC2.png?height=922&width=1409&&&&size=medium)\n\n### How Can Front-end Interact with Smart Contract in Different Blockchains with JavaScript code?\n\nOnce a smart contract is deployed to all supported blockchain networks, the compiled contract JSON files can be copied to front end codebase and then deployed along with other assets:\n\n![Shell Script to Sync Compiled Contract JSON](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8U9UTf1HzsbKJMD6i5T9.jpg?height=992&width=1139)\n\nAt runtime, after web3.js (Ethereum JavaScript API)  is properly initialized, the front-end will be able to retrieve public testnet contract address from the compiled contract JSON:\n\n```\ngetContractInfo(contractJson) {\n  this.initBcInfo()\n  const currencySymbol = this.bcInfo.currencySymbol\n  const contractName = contractJson.contractName\n  const envKey = 'VITE_BOOKSTORE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS'\n  let contractAddr = import.meta.env[envKey + '_' + currencySymbol]\n  if (!contractAddr || contractAddr == '') {\n    const network = contractJson.networks[this.bcInfo.networkId]\n    contractAddr = network ? network.address : import.meta.env[envKey]\n  }\n  const result = { contractAddr, contractName }\n  console.log(\n    `getContractInfo(${currencySymbol}): ${JSON.stringify(result)}`,\n  )\n  return result\n},\n```\n\nThen it can create web3.eth.Contract object as below, after which the front-end will be able to call any public method defined in the smart contract:\n\n```\ninitContractJson(compiledContractJson, contractInfo) {\n  var abiArray = compiledContractJson['abi']\n  if (abiArray == undefined) {\n    const error = 'BcExplorer error: missing ABI in the compiled Truffle JSON.'\n    console.error(error)\n    throw new Error(error)\n  }\n \n  const { contractAddr, contractName } = contractInfo\n  if (!this.web3().utils.isAddress(contractAddr)) {\n    const error = `wrong contract address - contractAddr: ${contractAddr}`\n    console.error(error)\n    throw new Error(error)\n  }\n \n  const contract = new this.web3inst.eth.Contract(abiArray, contractAddr)\n  contract.currencySymbol = this.info.currencySymbol\n  this.contractInst[contractName] = contract\n  this.contractAddr[contractName] = contractAddr\n  console.log(`contract with name ${contractName} initialized`)\n}\n```\n\nAs different blockchains require different gas fees, instead of suggesting them from the code,  it would be better to let them handled by MetaMask by setting both maxPriorityFeePerGas and maxFeePerGas options to null:\n\n```\n    invokeSmartContract(\n      contractName,\n      method,\n      getContractInfo,\n      updateTransactionStatus,\n    ) {\n      const contractInfo = getContractInfo(contractName, method)\n      const option = {\n        from: contractInfo.address,\n        maxPriorityFeePerGas: null,\n        maxFeePerGas: null,\n      }\n      if (contractInfo.value) {\n        option.value = contractInfo.value\n      }\n \n      contractInfo.method\n        .send(option, (error, txHash) =>\n          this.sendTransactionCallback(\n            contractName,\n            method,\n            error,\n            txHash,\n            updateTransactionStatus,\n          ),\n        )\n        .then((txReceipt) =>\n          this.handleTransactionReceipt(\n            contractName,\n            method,\n            contractInfo.bookId,\n            txReceipt,\n            updateTransactionStatus,\n          ),\n        )\n        .catch((error) => {\n          this.userInteractionCompleted({ result: 'error', error })\n          if (updateTransactionStatus) {\n            updateTransactionStatus(error, null)\n          }\n        })\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Where to find the sample dApp?\n\n* GitHub repo for both Solidity-based Smart contracts and Vue3-based SPA:\n\n[https://github.com/inflaton/decentralized-bookstore.git](https://github.com/inflaton/decentralized-bookstore.git)\n\n* dApp deployed at Netlify:\n\n[https://decentralized-bookstore.netlify.app/](https://decentralized-bookstore.netlify.app/)\n\n* dApp deployed at IPFS:\n\n[http://dweb.link/ipfs/QmTgoPpWnGMnPhNSBKmsoWdSLEFzmhwZcep6JHQ935TZw2/](http://dweb.link/ipfs/QmTgoPpWnGMnPhNSBKmsoWdSLEFzmhwZcep6JHQ935TZw2/)\n\nHope you have enjoyed the reading and will find this sample dApp useful.

In addition, we can help to reduce the carbon footprint of the food production process by using less land and water.\n\nA decentralized food supply chain is one in which food production, processing, distribution, and consumer purchases are integrated and coordinated within a relatively short distance.\n\nThe decentralized food supply system is an alternative to the industrial food system, which is reliant on large-scale monocrop production, long-distance transport, and global trade.\n\nA decentralized system is often more efficient and higher quality than an industrialized one. Modular technology can help small scale producers to grow more food and produce more food with less effort.\n\nWith patented protection over corporate influence and a dedication to the creative commons for we will scale the development our technology so producers can easily setup integrated solutions, products, and services to participate toward decentralization.\n\nThis will result in more people having access to fresh, healthy food. It will also reduce the environmental impact of the food system by minimizing transportation distances and energy use.\n\nOver the last century, there have been significant advances in our understanding of plant genetics and how plants develop.\n\nThis has allowed us to create new plant varieties that are more resistant to disease and pests, and that can grow in a wider range of environmental conditions. However, much of this research has been focused on individual genes and on making small changes to the plant's DNA.\n\nThis approach has its limits, as it is difficult to predict how a plant will respond to a change in its environment. A more promising approach is to create controlled environments in which plants can be grown under specific conditions.\n\nThe study of plant development and evolution in a controlled setting, and to identify plant plant growth patterns and their best suited particular environment.\n\nThis systems approach also gives the opportunity to stabilize or amplify the existing conditions in a local environment, which can help to improve plant productivity in marginal areas.\n\nEnvironmental sensors are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and their use is providing researchers with a greater understanding of plant development and evolution.\n\nBy tracking the environmental conditions under which plants grow, sensors can help to identify the plant varieties that are best suited for a particular environment.\n\nIn addition, sensors can be used to monitor the progress of plant growth, and to track the movement of pollen and other plant materials. This information can then be used to develop new methods of crop production, and to identify potential problems with existing crops.\n\nAs sensors become more affordable and easier to use, they are likely to play an increasingly important role in the study of plant development and evolution.\n\nThe vertical farm is a type of agricultural facility that produces crops in vertically stacked layers. Sensor systems integrated into the framework of the vertical farm offer potential to generate valuable data about plant development under controlled environmental conditions.\n\nThese sensor systems can measure factors such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, and carbon dioxide levels. Measuring environmental factors will likely play an increasingly important role in the study of plant development and evolution.\n\nIn addition, sensor data can be used to optimize growing conditions for specific crops, resulting in higher yields and better quality produce. The integrated sensor system have the potential to revolutionize agriculture by making it more efficient, productive, and sustainable.\n\nA vertical farm is a type of agriculture where crops are grown in vertically stacked layers in a controlled environment.Vertical farms can be used to grow a variety of crops, including fruits, vegetables, and grains.\n\nOne major benefit of vertical farming is that it allows farmers to grow crops year-round, regardless of the weather outside. Additionally, because vertical farms are typically located in urban areas, they can help to reduce the amount of land needed for agriculture.\n\nVertical farms also use less water than traditional farms, and they can minimize the spread of pests and diseases. As a result, vertical farming is an increasingly popular option for those looking to produce food in a more sustainable way.\n\nIntegrated sensor systems offer the potential to generate valuable data about plant development by measuring a variety of environmental factors.\n\nSensors can measure light levels, soil moisture, and temperature. This data can be used to track the progress of a plant's growth, identify stressors that may be affecting its development, and predict future yield.\n\nIn addition, sensor systems can be used to monitor the health of a crop by detecting early signs of disease or pests. By providing detailed information about plant development, integrated sensor systems have the potential to revolutionize agriculture.\n\nIn order to optimize growing conditions for specific crops, it is necessary to collect data about the conditions under which the crop grows best.\n\nThis data can be collected through studies of the crop's natural habitat, experiments with different growing conditions, and surveys of farmers who have experience growing the crop. Once this data is collected, it can be analyzed to identify patterns and trends.\n\nThis analysis can then be used to develop models that predict how the crop will respond to different conditions. These models can be used to optimize the growing environment for the crop, thereby increasing yield and quality.\n\nIn order to ensure that the data is of high quality, it is important to use reliable sources and methods of collection and analysis. Using data and statistics to optimize growing conditions can be an effective way to increase crop yields and improve quality.\n\nThe vertical farm is a type of agriculture that is increasingly being adopted by farmers due to its many potential benefits.\n\nOne key advantage of the vertical farm is the integrated sensor system. This system monitors various parameters such as temperature, humidity, and light intensity. By doing so, it allows for greater control over the growing environment.\n\nAs a result, the plants can be grown more efficiently, with less water and fewer pesticides. In addition, the sensor system can also help to reduce food waste by alerting farmers when the produce is ready to harvest.\n\nOverall, the integrated sensor system of the vertical farm offers a number of potential benefits that make it an attractive option for agricultural production.\n\nWhile vertical growing technology and vertical farming offer a number of potential benefits, there are also a number of challenges that need to be addressed in order to realize these benefits. One challenge is the high initial investment cost.\n\nVertical farms require specialized equipment and infrastructure, which can be expensive. Additionally, vertical farms often require higher levels of energy and water consumption than traditional farming methods.\n\nUsing a specialized infrastructure we can find ways to build the tools required to scale outcomes of the innovation and technology in action. The current infrastructure is not equipped to handle the demand for these services.\n\nThe need for these specialized services has become more apparent as the use of technology in our everyday lives has increased. With the right tools in place, we can overcome these challenges and continue to innovate and improve the way we live and work.\n\nAs such, it is important to ensure that vertical farms are designed and operated in an efficient manner in order to minimize these costs. As vertical farming continues to grow in popularity, it is important to ensure that these farms are designed and operated in a way that minimizes costs.\n\nOne way to do this is by using efficient growing methods, such as hydroponics. In addition, it is important to use energy-efficient lighting and climate control systems.Another challenge is the lack of standards and regulations for vertical farming.\n\nThis lack of regulation can lead to a wide range of practices being used, which can make it difficult to compare the costs and benefits of different farms.\n\nAs vertical farms continue to grow in popularity, there is an increasing amount of public pressure on influencers to push for solutions that will lead to change in regulation.\n\nThis can often lead to a wide range of practices being used the key factors include the type of crops grown, the climatic conditions of the farm, the level of automation, and the size of the farm.\n\nAs vertical farming becomes more widespread, it is important to develop standards and regulations that will help to ensure that these farms are operated efficiently and in a way that minimizes costs.\n\nAs vertical farming is still a relatively new technology, there are no standardized methods or regulations governing its use.\n\nThis lack of standards can make it difficult for farmers to compare different types of vertical farms and choose the most appropriate option for their needs.\n\nFinally, vertical farms can generate a significant efficiency, which needs to be properly managed and utilized to offer the potential benefits. Vertically Integrated Agriculture is here to meet the number of challenges that need to be addressed in order to realize these benefits.", "timestamp": 1653260608, "digest": "Bn2P7dL7RPGAcWHu2fa_L2oqqDvIz6clhL9zoUbAsPM", "contributor": "0xC38A688a3c8111B174aaa30c6576da598Dd74cCF"}

MODになってほしいからと偽discordリンクに招待、その後verifyのためと謳ったscamサイトに誘導し、Discordのトークンを抜き取りアカウントを奪われます。\n5. トラブルに会った場合、サポートするという内容のscamがTwitter、Discord、Telegramに大量に来ますが、1対1のサポートはまずscamです。\n\n## 偽リンクを踏まない\n\n### 広告における偽物\n\nGoogle Search、Twitterの広告には偽プロジェクトを謳い、あなたの資産を奪おうとしてきます。そういう場合は、公式Twitter、公式Discord、coingecko、Defillamaなど信頼の置けるサイトから飛ぶようにします。\n\n公式Twitterはフォロワーの数、共通でフォローしてる人の数から判断してください。フォロー数にもよりますが、0\\~10人程度なら怪しくて、たとえ数万人居たとしてもフォロワーを購入しています。\n\n### Twitter\n\n偽のサポート、公式マークが付いている、フォロワーが多い。どれも全部関係ないです。共通フォローが多いかを確認しましょう。\n\n紛らわしいので非フォロワー、フォローからの通知をoffにしましょう。\n\n### 偽のDiscordリンク\n\n![doodles公式](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z54azGgPUHad9zG1kYIen.png?height=383&width=759)\n\n例えば、DoodlesのDiscordリンクはdiscord.gg/doodlesです。これはサーバーブースターというDiscordの機能によってレベル3を達成すると招待コードを好きな文字列に変更できます。\n\n例えば、僕が大きなNFTプロジェクト(akashi)を持っていて、50人だけ招待したいとします。通常discordの招待はランダムな文字列になり、abcdefgというコードを50人の制限をかけてTwitterで配布します。51人目以降はそのdiscordには招待コードが切れましたというメッセージが表示されます。\n\nここにscamを狙っているAさんがいるとします。僕のabcdefgというコードが切れた後だと、ブーストしているレベル3のdiscordサーバーはabcdefgという招待コードを作成できます。それを狙って、abcdefgというコードで偽akashiサーバーに誘導します。そこで偽サイトから(以下略)\n\n### Telegram\n\n自分が被害にあったのはこれです。公式を名乗った偽のtelegramがたくさんあります。\n\nさあ名前だけを見てどれが公式かわかりますか？僕にはわかりませんが、選択されているのと、Announcements以外は偽のセールが行われていました。\n\nTelegramはもうscamの温床になってるので、自分は殆ど使っていません。偽公式に簡単に辿れるのでかなり注意が必要です。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JO7HU5KI1MJ0zMNCGPrpC.png?height=379&width=567)\n\n### Instagram\n\nInstagramには公式以外にもたくさんの偽物アカウントが存在し、Twitterと違って、数万人フォロワーがいることが多いです。中には偽物のほうがフォロワー数が多いケースも有るため、気をつけなければなりません。\n\nInstagramが一番怖いです。\n\n### Openseaの偽コレクション\n\n1. 公式マークは関係ない\n2. 公式Discord、Twitterに記載されているofficial linkからOpenseaに飛ぶ\n3. コントラクトアドレスでOpenseaの検索をする\n4. 安い価格に飛びつかず、出来高を確認し、10ETH以下なら偽のコレクションと判断する(そもそも流動性のないプロジェクトに飛びつかないよう)\n\n最近Phantom Network(PxN)という大きなプロジェクトのmintが開始されました。もちろんそれを狙って、偽コレクションも始動します。\n\n0x160c404b2b49cbc3240055ceaee026df1e8497a0はPxNのコントラクトで事前に公開されていました。以下画像2枚目にある通り既に**偽のコレクション**は消されていますが、偽のコレクションで100ETH以上の取引がありました。\n\n[https://twitter.com/dingalingts/status/1522055650028978176](https://twitter.com/dingalingts/status/1522055650028978176)\n\nなお既に犯人は特定されています。\n\n[https://twitter.com/Serpent/status/1522059672886251521](https://twitter.com/Serpent/status/1522059672886251521)\n\n## 偽サイトにアクセスした場合\n\nウォレット接続はただRead権限を与えるだけのはずなので問題ないです。署名(signature)、トランザクション、approveを行うと、そのウォレットを危険に晒すことになります。仮に行った場合は、revokeする、そのウォレットからすべての資産を移動するなどして二度と使わないなどの対応を取り、資産を守ります。\n\nrevoke先\n\n[https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker](https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker)\n\nappriveの仕組み\n\n[https://youtu.be/N05FR_e7124?t=949](https://youtu.be/N05FR_e7124?t=949)\n\n### Metamaskを捨ててRabbyを利用する\n\nセキュリティ対策がたくさん盛り込まれています。これだけで9割は防げるはずです。\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/yakisobaminister.eth/nKCSnpvrobSShtdESJArIUwOIXYUR4exyu1O4Opkooc](https://mirror.xyz/yakisobaminister.eth/nKCSnpvrobSShtdESJArIUwOIXYUR4exyu1O4Opkooc)\n\n### 偽のNFT、トークン\n\n例えばですが、以下のようなよく知らないコレクションがhiddenやopenseaそのままに送信されることがあります。それらをhiddenに動かしたり、別のアドレスに送ってしまうとウォレット内資産が取られる危険性があるため、触らずにそのままにしておきましょう。\n\n![偽のコレクション](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KfRFbQOYObr6HXrC3BqXd.png?height=506&width=1114)\n\n![謎エアドロップ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XEBYfUFHfMJ5IWjE1UrSP.png?height=507&width=1229)\n\n![アクセスしたらお金上げる系](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YvPrQ4W_Aeuc-hMYTJQXq.png?height=283&width=1130)\n\n### テストネット\n\nNFTだけやってる人にありがちですが、ETHメインネットとテストネットのトークンを同一視してしまうことがあります。テストネットトークンは誰でも無限に受け取れて、それ自体に価値がないので、rapsten,kovan,rinkbyなどのトークンで取引を成立してはいけません。必ず相手のリンクは踏まずに、opensea、looksrare、x2y2など公式のリンクから出品しましょう。\n\n[https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/)\n\n### フィッシングメール\n\nこれがなんだかんだ簡単で引っかかる人が多いです。最近はLedgerのメールアドレスが流出して、フィッシングメールが届くようになったようです。\n\n基本的にWeb3ではメールを使いません。メールが届くのはサービスに登録したものです。Openseaから取引完了のメールが届くでしょうけど、僕はフィッシングと紛らわしいため全部ブロックしています。Web3とは関係ないと思いきや、Appleアカウントのフィッシングから資産を取られたケースもあります。Metamask(メール登録箇所ない)から来ることもありますが、まずありえないので、定期的にメールアドレスの整理を行いましょう。疑わしい場合は誰かに確認を。\n\n### 番外編 偽giveaway\n\n本物に混じって偽giveawayが行われていることがあります。今だと日本ではstepnが多いですが、人気NFTプロジェクトにも例があります。\n\nフォロワーを無料で獲得するためにやっているため、野放しにするといずれ詐欺アカウントに変容し、詐欺に加担することにつながるので、避けましょう。自分は偽giveaway参加者はいつか自分も被害に合うかもしれないと思って全てブロックしてます。", "timestamp": 1653264136, "digest": "7a9z0TakP7y9xHb7kocA8lHDpBu9-1PaaHnqfib2M14", "contributor": "0xAe74399237E02458aa42283e7c3ef2929AD4896C"}

The manganese Committee of China Railway Association called on the industry to limit and reduce production by 50%\n18. On the afternoon of May 12, the manganese Professional Committee of China ferroalloy industry association held a video conference attended by 40 manganese member units in China. Recently, due to the large-scale production restriction and maintenance of steel plants, the demand for manganese alloys has continued to be weak, and the disk price of silicon manganese futures has reached a record low, which has seriously affected the sales price of silicon manganese alloys in the spot market. The devaluation of RMB, the high price of imported manganese ore and the high price of coal coke have led to a sharp rise in the production cost of manganese alloys and a sharp decline in the price of electrolytic manganese, resulting in the continuous decline of the price of medium and low manganese, Manganese alloy products are at a loss in the whole industry, and sales are under great pressure, and all units have different degrees of inventory. In order to reverse this situation as soon as possible, the manganese Professional Committee of ferroalloy industry association called on the 40 manganese member units participating in the meeting to take positive action, comprehensively carry out industry self-help, strictly implement the limit and reduce production by 50%. The 40 manganese alloy manufacturers participating in the meeting have a monthly production capacity of 1.2 million tons, strictly implement the monthly production reduction of 600000 tons, and reduce the purchase of 1.2 million tons of ore outside the month, so as to alleviate the serious surplus of manganese alloys, So as to reduce the losses caused by vicious competition within the industry.\n19.

In fact, these things in the boudoir of two people are not secrets. In fact, they are very normal things. Therefore, if you do it very affectedly, it is something that usually happens (are you worried about going away?) I’m afraid of this aspect, so I made a lot of preparations and stuck those adhesive tapes, but the horse God is very good. I can see everything that should be seen and everything that should not be seen (did the horse God see nosebleed at the scene?) I forgot. Yes, I didn’t pay attention at all.

{"id": "IhaZydlxwqYsVvgSVuhGIviD5eThB96rZ3AmhFYI6nE", "title": "To truly move towards Gree \"electric\", Dong Mingzhu plans to \"strengthen\" Dunan environmental control", "body": "Due to the new action of the major shareholder Gree Electric Appliance, the trading of Dunan environment shares was officially suspended on May 12. The night before yesterday, Dunan environment announced that the company had received a notice from Gree Electric. In order to consolidate its control position, Gree Electric was planning to transfer 9.71% of the shares held by Dunan holdings.\n\nDunan environment, with refrigeration devices as its main business, has continuously expanded its business boundaries in recent years and entered the new energy vehicle track through the layout of key parts of the new energy vehicle thermal management system. In the view of insiders, Gree Electric’s move is to further enhance its holding position, enhance its voice in the field of core parts in the middle reaches of the refrigeration and air conditioning industry chain, and improve the layout of its new energy auto parts industry.\n\n“For Gree, this benign expansion is relatively beneficial, especially when the market is at a relatively low level. Mergers and acquisitions and offers can not only get a complementary space between the control of listed companies and the industrial chain, but also increase equity income financially in the future,” said Xuan Jiyou, head of Qianmen assets and manager of private equity funds, in an interview with the Securities Daily\n\nWhy Dunan environment?\n\nDunan environment announced that since Gree has held 29.48% shares of Dunan environment, if Gree agreed to transfer 9.71% shares of Dunan environment, it will trigger the obligation of comprehensive tender offer.\n\nThen, why does Gree Electric not hesitate to pay real gold and silver to continue to hold Dunan environmental shares?\n\nIt is understood that in recent years, Dunan environment has concentrated on the equipment manufacturing industry after business downsizing, involving two business segments. Among them, the parts segment covers refrigeration parts, new energy vehicle thermal management parts, etc., while the refrigeration equipment segment mainly includes three parts: commercial central air conditioning, special air conditioning and cold chain system.\n\nThe engine thermal management system is like installing a frequency conversion air conditioner for the engine to realize the intelligent control of the engine cooling system, which can reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency. At the same time, it is also a key field in the middle reaches of the new energy vehicle industry chain. This is an important direction for Gree Electric to regard it as a “new air outlet” and continue to increase its layout.\n\nZhou Haibin, founder of automotive culture, told reporters that Gree Electric’s enhanced control of Dunan environment can ensure the autonomy and controllability of core parts, and continuously expand and improve the layout in the field of new energy vehicle thermal management business.\n\nIn recent years, affected by the epidemic situation and the complex environment at home and abroad, the supply of both air conditioners and auto parts is relatively tight. While the supply chain is unstable, the price of raw materials continues to rise, making downstream manufacturers more passive.\n\nIn the view of insiders, Gree Electric appliance can kill many birds with one arrow by putting Dunan environment under its command. “Increasing the shareholding ratio of Dunan environment will undoubtedly provide it with a stronger voice in the air conditioning and new energy vehicle industry chain, and change from passive to active. At the same time, Gree Electric can also increase the size and layout of the hot cold chain industry in recent years.” Guo Shiliang, an expert of whale platform think tank and financial commentator, told the reporter of Securities Daily.\n\nIt is worth noting that due to the rapid growth of refrigeration accessories business, Dunan environment performed well last year. The annual report shows that in 2021, the company achieved a revenue of 9.837 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 33.28%; The net profit attributable to the parent company was 405 million yuan and the non net profit deducted was 379 million yuan. Among them, the net profit attributable to the parent company and the net profit deducted from the non parent company both reached a new high since the listing in 2004.\n\n“If the subsequent Dunan environment maintains high-speed performance growth, it will also drive the performance improvement of Gree Electric Appliance, contribute more income and profits to its diversified sectors, and increase its investment value in the capital market.” Xuan Jiyou said.\n\n“Iron Lady” active attack style reappearance\n\nIn fact, Gree Electric Appliance completed its ownership of Dunan environment in April this year. According to the announcement issued by Dunan environment on April 29 this year, Gree Electric transferred the shares of Dunan environment held by Dunan Seiko, accounting for 29.48% of the total share capital, and the transfer price was about 2.190 billion yuan. With the completion of the equity transfer registration procedures, Gree Electric officially became the controlling shareholder of Dunan environment.\n\nHowever, becoming a major shareholder of Dunan environment is not easy. Recently, Zijin investment, a subsidiary of Zijin mining, signed an agreement with Dunan holdings to invest 7.682 billion yuan to acquire four asset packages of Dunan holdings, the second largest shareholder of Dunan environment.\n\nNow Gree Electric plans to transfer shares, which shows its importance to the control of the company. If the acquisition is completed, combined with the previous 29.48% shares, Gree Electric will hold 39.19% equity of Dunan environment.\n\n“As the major shareholder Gree Electric has no actual controller, Dunan environment also has no actual controller. Gree Electric has firmly grasped the control and discourse power in its hands by obtaining a high shareholding ratio, which is also the embodiment of Dong Mingzhu’s’ Iron Lady ‘style.” Zhang Jianfeng, Executive Deputy Secretary General of China household appliance business association, believes that.\n\nGree “electric” layout speed up\n\nThe acquisition of Dunan environment is only a corner of Gree Electric’s strategy. In 2021, it made two major acquisitions in succession, both around the refrigeration industry chain and the new energy vehicle industry chain, and both of them were completed by holding shares. Last August, Gree Electric invested 1.828 billion yuan to acquire 30.47% equity of Yinlong new energy, and renamed it Gree titanium new energy in November.\n\n“The first step is to acquire Yinlong new energy, the second step is to enter Dunan environment and step by step enhance the controlling stake. Gree Electric appliance is improving its new energy and automobile industry chain from the perspective of batteries and parts, so as to accelerate the transformation of Gree from electric appliance to a more diversified scientific and technological group.” Guo Shiliang thinks.\n\nGree Electric Appliance moves frequently, or is playing a big game of chess. In February this year, at the shareholders’ meeting of Gree Electric, Dong Mingzhu said that Gree Electric has come to the time of truly diversified Gree “electric”, and is planning to separate and list the businesses of Gree equipment and industrial core components. In addition, Dong Mingzhu previously revealed that Gree’s CNC machine tools have the ability to process key auto parts.\n\n“Gree Electric has frequently initiated mergers and acquisitions, which shows that its plan to build a new Gree has been accelerated and hopes to fight the next blue ocean. Today’s electrical engineering covers almost all engineering activities related to electronics and photons. In Gree’s’ electrical ‘layout, new energy, auto parts, intelligent equipment and so on are all changing the company’s ownership", "timestamp": 1653265071, "digest": "pGc1aTK8_mU9BOkUlvx80e2xewZf6Rcln1tcoGxG4do", "contributor": "0xf9744ce3d57feFdf299a188d41e603AbBFcE353D"}

{"id": "YArpqmNP1XOjiW2LR--xooe053oqEYnt6KMi4faYHLA", "title": "The Funding Cooperative DAO: unleashing the collective power of founders", "body": "> *TL;DR - founders need to come together to balance power dynamics with sources of capital and to make real the world we all imagine. We can do that through some basic DeFi applied to DAO formation - instead of “just” creating a token to govern **one** DAO, what if we linked arms and built a token and a DAO amongst **many** of us? How could this pattern become a primitive used by many web3 communities to balance the forces, increase founder support and diversification, and fund the growth of a much larger and more inclusive web3?  This is our mission at the Funding Cooperative DAO and our first group of DAOs is gathering, arm in arm -> join us now.*\n\nThere has been a lot of talk about the power dynamic shifting towards founders during the heights of the recent macroeconomic cycle. Funding is up, company formation is up, and most importantly the number of engaged developers is up, and valuations *were* up. Data from a16z’s recent Crypto Report suggest the shift to web3 has been accelerating.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YC4El9kA-zvAJXzEbjbga.png?height=566&width=1368)\n\nAnd now the cycle is turned. As the tide recedes we are going to learn a lot about how resilient the economy really is. And countless founders are going to find that to their investors, they are just one of many investments. The start-up that to a founder feels like a reflection of their deepest purpose - may become a victim of triage in a venture fund’s emergency ward, left in the hallway as nature takes its course.\n\nweb3 is supposed to be different. Built on the foundation of resilient, distributed, open-source, and autonomous systems such as Ethereum and communities that proudly disregard the status, privilege, and gatekeeping of the traditional economy - surely we will prosper even as the web2 economy undergoes another bout of ‘creative destruction.’\n\nAnd yet what about our foundations?  How solid are our foundations?  \n\nSpecifically - founders. How can we collectively find and support more founders, the true basis of all innovation? How are we treating them in web3?  The path of a web3 founder or technical builder isn’t as pretty as we might all think.\n\n### Builders want to build: \n\nIn the words of a prolific builder and Funding Cooperative DAO member who has launched a number of projects:\n\n> *“I don’t want to answer questions like ‘wen token?’  At least not yet.  I don’t want to spend one freaking second thinking about ‘token go up.’ I don’t want to hire a lawyer, do a funding deck, and see the power seeping from the developers to the investors. I want to build.”*\n\nThese words echo what we have heard in many interviews over the last several months. And they resemble the experience of many of us in helping to found and foster open source projects back in our web2 days. Despite the ever-growing number of projects that help in DAO formation and management and the success of projects like GitCoin and SeedCamp, builders are not yet founding web3 projects at anything close to the pace we all would like to see.  \n\nHere are a few statistics about the relative scale of web3 - so far:\n\n* 2021 was a year of crypto and web3 hype - and yet according to data from Crunchbase, only 5% of venture deals were in the web3 space.  \n* Deep Dao as of May 2022, only lists 91 DAOs with over $1 million assets under management - and approximately 50% of the total AUM is concentrated in only three DAOs.  \n* As pointed out by A16Z in their recent state of crypto report, the AUM of all of DeFi would rank as the 31st largest bank in the United States.\n* On average there were just over 15,000 businesses receiving an employer ID number just in the United States each day. These are employers that are likely to actually employ someone as opposed to S corps which are individual companies - there are many more of these.  By comparison there are only 4,834 projects listed on DeepDao.  \n\n***There are 3x more “normie companies” founded in the US in a day than there are DAOs in existence.***  \n\nWe have a long, long way to go for web3 to become the favored home of founders and especially of those that are technology-focused. \n\nHere are some of the DAO founder pain points that we are building to solve:\n\n* Diversification: \n  * “My DAO contributors - and investors - have their fingers in many pies.  I’m all-in over here at this DAO.  What happens to me and my co-founders if it only does ok?” \n  * “We wanted to diversify our treasury but a) liquidity remains low so sales crush the price and b) the token holders are short-term focused, they want ‘token go up….So they shoot down our proposals and push us to hype more and HUDL HUDL HUDL.”\n* Loneliness:\n  * We *all* have imposter syndrome.  And we *all* have experienced, some of us more than others, gaslighting by investors and others who would profit if only you saw the world their way and acquiesced to their strategies. While web3 vibes are generally positive and welcoming, founders told us that there are few safe places to talk about DAO growth and challenges with others that are at a similar stage in their founding journey.  \n* Power law and the very few chances founders have to win:\n  * Those of us that think in terms of economics and finance are all too aware of the power-law nature of returns in traditional venture capital.  It turns out that all of the returns to venture capital investors are contributed by the top several percent of companies. Returns to founders are even more skewed, meaning the vast majority of founders would have been better off if they had taken a reasonably well-paying job. \n  * If each start-up takes 4-5 years for a committed founder, they may only have 4-5 potential start-ups in their life. On the other side of the table, venture capitalists always already have dozens of companies in their portfolios. Given that - which side of the table is more likely to experience the transformative impact of a top 1% or .1% company?  And how does that reinforce centralization?\n\n### Helping builders through a DAO of DAOs and a DAO of DAOs of DAOs?\n\nOur approach is pretty simple. DAOs of DAOs. Nested DAOs. DAOs all the way down.  And diversification.  \n\nLet’s gain diversification, community, support, and a higher likelihood of a massive outcome by using some web3 primitives to create a shared DAO amongst a portfolio of DAOs. And let’s form a DAO - we call it the Funding Cooperative DAO - to recruit, select, launch and support those portfolios.  \n\nEach DAO of DAOs consists of several DAOs that have passed through diligence. Through token swaps and other primitives, we seed for them a DAO that is jointly owned by them. We also call this the “cohort DAO” as a working title. Each cohort DAO represents a season of DAOs that have joined the Funding Cooperative.\n\nThe Funding Cooperative DAO is a DAO of DAOs of DAOs. “FC DAO” exists to improve the processes before, during, and after the creation of the cohort DAOs. Concretely this means we are building:\n\n* A better graph to recruit web2 and web3 builders to think about founding DAOs - emphasizing outreach to underrepresented groups and partnering with many others in the web3 ecosystem with a similar mission\n* Customized to purpose token swap primitives, building on existing token swaps\n  * While one to one token swaps are a solved problem, we are extending these to many to one and one to many swaps, all performed atomically \n* Customized to purpose token creation and launch processes\n  * Thank you to the Juicebox crew for being so responsive and creative\n* Partnerships with many existing communities that nurture DAOs, including MovementDAO and others, as places where members of cohort DAOs can thrive; we work together with partners on all phases of the cohort DAO life cycle from recruitment to formation and growth.\n\n### Ok DAO of DAOs of DAOs: “wen token?”\n\nIf you have read this far along, thank you!  Here are a few ways you can participate immediately.\n\nFirst, join the Funding Cooperative DAO.  Drop-in to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/vUGcJrqh3Q) and say hi. Everyone who joins and helps out in a substantial way will receive an airdrop; also we have basic payment rails set up and will be adding more core contributors in the weeks to come. As an example, one of your first quests could be helping to execute an OP-inspired retroactive community airdrop: Merkle tree FTW!  We have a number of software projects underway or kicking off and we are building out our own DAO structure as we increasingly decentralize. Engineers and DAO operators are especially in need.  \n\nSecondly, soon we will be talking about the participation of several amazing early stage DAOs and their founders. In contributing to one of us you are contributing to all of us. We will have a series of blogs and tweets about each of these DAOs in the weeks to come. Stay tuned and stay hyped.  \n\nThird, builders please apply and suggest other builders!  Our process for review is increasingly automated - within a day or two, we will give you directional feedback.  Basically, we are looking for technical depth and demonstrated trustworthiness, we are not trying to be gatekeepers as much as we are a mechanism for trustworthy technical DAO founders to link arms and bootstrap together the diversification, liquidity, and community we all need.\n\n**Apply now!  <https://tally.so/r/m68JLe>**  \n\nOur vision is of a world in which web3 helps address age-old challenges to innovation, including centralization of capital, gatekeeping of opportunity, and founder stress and insecurity. We think the Funding Cooperative DAO can play a small role - that grows over time with your help - in making web3 the center of innovation for decades to come. Let’s work together to build a DAO that helps invent the future we all want to see.  \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1653264934, "digest": "_pvyaQmJs-FoSqC-YzNTD-NKZV9l448aP4XqSuvPFAA", "contributor": "0xEdeCAB02F65AD9dB661f5fA5629c3d57Ca8B26c5"}

Organization: focus on these directions", "body": "Stock speculation depends on the Research Report of Jinqilin analyst. It is authoritative, professional, timely and comprehensive to help you tap the potential theme opportunities!\n\nFinancial Associated Press (Shanghai, editor Zilong) today (April 18), the auto parts sector rose sharply, and individual stocks set off a wave of trading limit. As of the closing, the sector index rose by more than 4%. In terms of individual stocks, Zoje Seiko, Bojun technology, Ningbo founder 20cm Trading limit, Shenda shares, Lianming shares, Yingli automobile, Jifeng shares, Tianlong shares, Wuxi Zhenhua and nearly 20 shares were trading limit, including kabeyi, newtag, Dongjian technology HENGSHUAI shares and Sioux sensors increased by more than 10%.\n\nNote: auto parts stocks set off a trading tide today (closing on April 18)\n\nThe resumption of the industrial chain is accelerated, and the valuation of the sector is ready for repair\n\nOn the news side, the Shanghai Economic and Information Technology Commission recently issued the guidelines for the prevention and control of the epidemic situation of industrial enterprises returning to work and production in Shanghai (First Edition). The guidelines specify that district governments, streets, towns and parks should actively support enterprises to resume work and production. At the same time, SAIC Group will start the pressure test of resumption of work and production on April 18, and all five main engine plants of FAW Group in Changchun will also resume work. CICC pointed out that Changchun and Shanghai promote the resumption of work and production, which is conducive to the valuation and repair of the auto zero industry chain. Excellent companies are expected to replenish orders after the end of the epidemic through excellent resumption of work and production control and excellent quality control, so as to achieve performance and valuation repair.\n\nAffected by the epidemic, the automobile production and sales data in March performed poorly. According to the data of China Automobile Industry Association, the automobile production and sales in March decreased by 9.1% and 11.7% respectively year-on-year. China Galaxy Securities pointed out that the outbreak of the epidemic has caused relevant enterprises to stop production, which will have a great impact on the supply of some complete vehicles and related parts and components. Superimposed on the impact of automobile supply side, the rise of raw material prices, the rise of vehicle prices or the narrowing of concessions, the weak demand and the weakening of consumers’ confidence in buying cars all limit the profit space of dealers. In April, due to the intensification of epidemic control, many auto shows were delayed or cancelled, and the launch of new cars was delayed, which also had a certain impact on sales. If the epidemic situation is controlled in mid and late April, the backlog of market demand in the short term will be released rapidly. It is expected that the sales volume in April is slightly better than that in the same period last year.\n\nIn addition, the trend of electrification and intelligence in the automotive industry remains unchanged, which will still be the main investment increment in the automotive and auto zero sector in the future. Since January this year, the sector has continued to decline. With the embodiment of valuation and cost performance, it is expected to usher in the repair market. Huaxi Securities believes that there is a significant correction in the current valuation of the whole vehicle sector and the auto parts sector. Among them, the valuation of the auto parts sector has been adjusted to a relatively low level in recent years. With the resumption of production approaching, it is suggested to grasp the bottom opportunity under the pessimistic mood and firmly optimistic about the new power industrial chain + incremental parts.\n\nWhat direction can we pay attention to after the epidemic? Consumption rebound recovers along the scene\n\nRecently, the plates related to the concept of post epidemic repair have rebounded significantly. As of today’s (April 18), according to the rise and fall of nearly 10 trading days, hotel catering, community group purchase, duty-free stores, logistics, prefabricated vegetables and other plates all led the rise. As the epidemic situation gradually ushered in an inflection point, its impact gradually dissipated, various policies for ensuring supply and production were implemented one after another, and market sentiment also improved. CITIC Securities pointed out that the main driver of a shares has switched from sentiment to fundamentals, while the negative impact of the economy on the market is weakening, and a number of pessimistic expectations in the market bottomed out in advance of the fundamental data.\n\nNote: plate situation in recent 10 trading days (closing on April 18)\n\nFor the future main line, Western Securities believes that with the gradual stabilization of the epidemic in Shanghai and China, offline economic repair will be an important main line of market transactions in the second quarter. The basic logic of offline economic recovery path is consistent with the relaxation direction of prevention and control policies. In various scenarios related to offline recovery, the recovery path follows: express delivery → flow of people, close consumption scenario → long-distance consumption scenario, required → optional, business travel → entertainment. From the perspective of market industry, the market repair of express, logistics, aviation, airport and other sectors is only the beginning. In the future, with the gradual verification of data, it is still worthy of continuous attention. The recovery of the epidemic situation in early 2020 and the prosperity of the market and industry have verified the order of consumption rebound along the scene:\n\n1) Logistics Express was the first to recover. As the lifeblood of urban material transportation, logistics is the first industry to recover. Judging from the impact of the current round of epidemic in Shanghai, the current core contradiction lies in the lack of smooth logistics caused by the closure of expressways around the country. However, once the strict control measures are alleviated, the logistics will be able to recover quickly first.\n\n2) The recovery of transportation is positively correlated with distance. In terms of microstructure, the recovery of railway passenger transport is faster than the turnover, which verifies that the short haul is the first to recover; From the perspective of RPK reflecting profitability, airlines with stronger RPK repair led the rebound.\n\n3) Advertising in the city → retail consumption in the city → recovery rhythm in the city. Catering takeout and retailers are the first consumption scenes to recover. The recovery of advertising depends on offline physical consumption, and the recovery progress is slightly slower than catering and retail. Structurally, supermarkets with mandatory attributes rebound ahead of department stores.\n\n4) Cinemas are the slowest consumer scenes in the city. Due to the particularity of its closed business place, the cinema is relatively backward after the previous post epidemic unsealing, so the repair process is also slow.\n\n5) The recovery of hotels and tourism is slower than catering retail, and business tourism is faster than leisure tourism. The repair of railway and civil aviation is later than the urban transportation, and the corresponding consumption scenes such as hotels and tourism are also later than the urban repair. In terms of pace, the recovery of tourism is slower than that of hotels, which reflects that tourism is slower than the repair of business travel.\n\nYour exclusive investment gift bag!

URLを確認する\n3. 疑わしいと思ったら焦りに負けず、チャットで正しいかを確認する(できない場合はscamの可能性高い)\n4. サイトのmint数、送り先コントラクトを確認し、その数に不都合がないかを確認する\n\n## DMは詐欺！！！！DMは詐欺！！！！DMは詐欺！！！\n\n### 1対1の取引をしない\n\nまず、DMで相手とやり取りすること自体リスクがあります。誰もが見えるパブリックな場所で交渉しましょう。交渉するにしても相手のリンクを踏まないようにしましょう。\n\nscamの数としては私見では Telegram > Discord > Twitterです。まずDMは詐欺前提であることを忘れず心置きなくブロックもしましょう。\n\nDMに関係するscamには思いついた限りでいくつかのscamがあります。\n\n1. 偽mintサイトへ誘導\n2. あなたのNFTがほしいからと交渉する\n3. クリエイター向けに詳細をpdfなど別途ファイルで添付する\n4. MODになってほしいからと偽discordリンクに招待、その後verifyのためと謳ったscamサイトに誘導し、Discordのトークンを抜き取りアカウントを奪われます。\n5. トラブルに会った場合、サポートするという内容のscamがTwitter、Discord、Telegramに大量に来ますが、1対1のサポートはまずscamです。\n\n## 偽リンクを踏まない\n\n### 広告における偽物\n\nGoogle Search、Twitterの広告には偽プロジェクトを謳い、あなたの資産を奪おうとしてきます。そういう場合は、公式Twitter、公式Discord、coingecko、Defillamaなど信頼の置けるサイトから飛ぶようにします。\n\n公式Twitterはフォロワーの数、共通でフォローしてる人の数から判断してください。フォロー数にもよりますが、0\\~10人程度なら怪しくて、たとえ数万人居たとしてもフォロワーを購入しています。\n\n### Twitter\n\n偽のサポート、公式マークが付いている、フォロワーが多い。どれも全部関係ないです。共通フォローが多いかを確認しましょう。\n\n公式を装った詐欺への誘導もよくあります。紛らわしいので非フォロワー、非フォローからの通知をoffにしましょう。\n\n### 偽のDiscordリンク\n\n![doodles公式](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z54azGgPUHad9zG1kYIen.png?height=383&width=759)\n\n例えば、DoodlesのDiscordリンクはdiscord.gg/doodlesです。これはサーバーブースターというDiscordの機能によってレベル3を達成すると招待コードを好きな文字列に変更できます。\n\n例えば、僕が大きなNFTプロジェクト(akashi)を持っていて、50人だけ招待したいとします。通常discordの招待はランダムな文字列になり、abcdefgというコードを50人の制限をかけてTwitterで配布します。51人目以降はそのdiscordには招待コードが切れましたというメッセージが表示されます。\n\nここにscamを狙っているAさんがいるとします。僕のabcdefgというコードが切れた後だと、ブーストしているレベル3のdiscordサーバーはabcdefgという招待コードを作成できます。それを狙って、abcdefgというコードで偽akashiサーバーに誘導します。そこで偽サイトから(以下略)\n\n### Telegram\n\n自分が被害にあったのはこれです。公式を名乗った偽のtelegramがたくさんあります。\n\nさあ名前だけを見てどれが公式かわかりますか？僕にはわかりませんが、選択されているのと、Announcements以外は偽のセールが行われていました。\n\nTelegramはもうscamの温床になってるので、自分は殆ど使っていません。偽公式に簡単に辿れるのでかなり注意が必要です。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JO7HU5KI1MJ0zMNCGPrpC.png?height=379&width=567)\n\n### Instagram\n\nInstagramには公式以外にもたくさんの偽物アカウントが存在し、Twitterと違って、数万人フォロワーがいることが多いです。中には偽物のほうがフォロワー数が多いケースも有るため、気をつけなければなりません。\n\nInstagramが一番怖いです。\n\n### Openseaの偽コレクション\n\n1. 公式マークは関係ない\n2. 公式Discord、Twitterに記載されているofficial linkからOpenseaに飛ぶ\n3. コントラクトアドレスでOpenseaの検索をする\n4. 安い価格に飛びつかず、出来高を確認し、10ETH以下なら偽のコレクションと判断する(そもそも流動性のないプロジェクトに飛びつかないよう)\n\n最近Phantom Network(PxN)という大きなプロジェクトのmintが開始されました。もちろんそれを狙って、偽コレクションも始動します。\n\n0x160c404b2b49cbc3240055ceaee026df1e8497a0はPxNのコントラクトで事前に公開されていました。以下画像2枚目にある通り既に**偽のコレクション**は消されていますが、偽のコレクションで100ETH以上の取引がありました。\n\n[https://twitter.com/dingalingts/status/1522055650028978176](https://twitter.com/dingalingts/status/1522055650028978176)\n\nなお既に犯人は特定されています。\n\n[https://twitter.com/Serpent/status/1522059672886251521](https://twitter.com/Serpent/status/1522059672886251521)\n\n## 偽サイトにアクセスした場合\n\nウォレット接続はただRead権限を与えるだけのはずなので問題ないです。署名(signature)、トランザクション、approveを行うと、そのウォレットを危険に晒すことになります。仮に行った場合は、revokeする、そのウォレットからすべての資産を移動するなどして二度と使わないなどの対応を取り、資産を守ります。\n\nrevoke先\n\n[https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker](https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker)\n\nappriveの仕組み\n\n[https://youtu.be/N05FR_e7124?t=949](https://youtu.be/N05FR_e7124?t=949)\n\n### Metamaskを捨ててRabbyを利用する\n\nセキュリティ対策がたくさん盛り込まれています。これだけで9割は防げるはずです。\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/yakisobaminister.eth/nKCSnpvrobSShtdESJArIUwOIXYUR4exyu1O4Opkooc](https://mirror.xyz/yakisobaminister.eth/nKCSnpvrobSShtdESJArIUwOIXYUR4exyu1O4Opkooc)\n\n### 偽のNFT、トークン\n\n例えばですが、以下のようなよく知らないコレクションがhiddenやopenseaそのままに送信されることがあります。それらをhiddenに動かしたり、別のアドレスに送ってしまうとウォレット内資産が取られる危険性があるため、触らずにそのままにしておきましょう。\n\n![偽のコレクション](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KfRFbQOYObr6HXrC3BqXd.png?height=506&width=1114)\n\n![謎エアドロップ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XEBYfUFHfMJ5IWjE1UrSP.png?height=507&width=1229)\n\n![アクセスしたらお金上げる系](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YvPrQ4W_Aeuc-hMYTJQXq.png?height=283&width=1130)\n\n### テストネット\n\nNFTだけやってる人にありがちですが、ETHメインネットとテストネットのトークンを同一視してしまうことがあります。テストネットトークンは誰でも無限に受け取れて、それ自体に価値がないので、rapsten,kovan,rinkbyなどのトークンで取引を成立してはいけません。必ず相手のリンクは踏んだり、トークンの送金、受取をせず、相手にできないと言われてもopensea、looksrare、x2y2など公式のリンクから出品しましょう。(そもそも1v1で相手にしない)\n\n[https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/)\n\n### フィッシングメール\n\nこれがなんだかんだ簡単で引っかかる人が多いです。最近はLedgerのメールアドレスが流出して、フィッシングメールが届くようになったようです。\n\n基本的にWeb3ではメールを使いません。メールが届くのはサービスに登録したものです。Openseaから取引完了のメールが届くでしょうけど、僕はフィッシングと紛らわしいため全部ブロックしています。Web3とは関係ないと思いきや、Appleアカウントのフィッシングから資産を取られたケースもあります。Metamask(メール登録箇所ない)から来ることもありますが、まずありえないので、定期的にメールアドレスの整理を行いましょう。疑わしい場合は誰かに確認を。\n\n### 番外編 偽giveaway\n\n本物に混じって偽giveawayが行われていることがあります。今だと日本ではstepnが多いですが、人気NFTプロジェクトにも例があります。\n\nフォロワーを無料で獲得するためにやっているため、野放しにするといずれ詐欺アカウントに変容し、詐欺に加担することにつながるので、避けましょう。自分は偽giveaway参加者はいつか自分も被害に合うかもしれないと思って全てブロックしてます。", "timestamp": 1653265355, "digest": "7a9z0TakP7y9xHb7kocA8lHDpBu9-1PaaHnqfib2M14", "contributor": "0xAe74399237E02458aa42283e7c3ef2929AD4896C"}

When U.S. stocks fall sharply, it is often the time of substantial outflow of foreign capital, which shows that the current risk preference of foreign capital is still disturbed by U.S. stocks, while the risk preference of A shares has been improved by policies, and a shares are expected to continue to go out of the independent market.\n\nDisk analysis\n\nAffected by the higher than expected CPI of the US in April, the expectation of the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by 75bp increased again, and the three major indexes of US stocks fell sharply overnight, but a shares still maintained a certain resilience and closed slightly lower yesterday. Finally, the market closed down 0.12% below the market, and the gem rose 0.22%. The total trading volume of the two cities decreased by 23.82% compared with the previous trading day. Although some funds began to leave the market due to external factors, the confidence of a shares has been significantly strengthened recently. Most funds began to flow into other low-level sectors after withdrawing from high-level sectors. The market sentiment remained stable and the confidence remained sufficient.\n\nThe amount of energy has decreased, the activity of individual stocks has not decreased, and the differentiation has increased. Yesterday, 75 stocks rose the limit, of which 5 stocks were on the 20% limit, 84 stocks rose above the 10% limit, 12 stocks fell by more than 10%, 4 stocks fell the limit, 210 stocks rose by more than 5%, and 74 stocks fell by more than 5%. The three child concept, education, Baijiu, electronic ID card, textile, etc. led the gainers, while the coal, real estate, agriculture, shipping, phosphorus chemical industry, catering tourism, etc. led the declines. The High-level Track stocks had a callback, the capital went their own way, the capacity was greatly reduced, the profit-making effect remained unchanged, the loss effect remained, the plate was in rapid rotation, the hot spots were difficult to continue, and the size index differentiation was the main feature of the opening on Thursday.\n\nTechnical analysis\n\nTechnically, after the market opened low on Thursday, it fluctuated around the closing point of the previous day, and closed with a slight decline in the end, showing a trend of price decline and volume contraction. The volume price relationship of 5-day line support, 20-day line back pressure and price decline and volume contraction means that the market has insufficient momentum to kill the decline, the daily MACD index continues to strengthen, and the short-term market is expected to restart the rebound trend.\n\nThe time-sharing chart technical indicators show that the 15 minute SKD indicator deviates from the bottom, the MACD indicator is about to be golden fork, the 30 minute SKD indicator is golden fork, and the 60 minute MACD indicator is still in a strong area, and there are rebound requirements in the short-term session.\n\nShanghai Stock Exchange 50 price decline and volume contraction, 5-day line lost and recovered, 10 line back pressure, the volume price relationship of price decline and volume contraction, lack of momentum to kill and fall, daily MACD index golden fork, and short-term rebound trend is expected.\n\nThe gem price rises and shrinks, the 20th line is lost and recovered, the 5th line and the 10th line are arranged in a long way, and the volume price deviation relationship of price rises and shrinks. There is callback pressure in the short-term session, and there will be a test in the 2323 point session. If the closing continues to stand above 2323 point, the form of “W bottom” will be confirmed.\n\nThrough comprehensive technical analysis, we believe that the short-term market is expected to restart the rebound trend and continue to challenge the pressure near 3100. Whether the large-scale market can stand above 3100 will determine the strength of the short-term market. If the large-scale market can be large-scale, it is expected to attack again. If it is difficult to be large-scale and placed below 3100, the large-scale market will continue to operate at the bottom of the box.\n\nFundamental analysis\n\nOn May 11, the National Bureau of statistics released China’s CPI and PPI data in April. CPI increased by 0.6% year-on-year and 0.4% month on month. The year-on-year and month on month growth of PPI contracted.\n\nSpecifically, in April, CPI rose by 2.1% year-on-year, the market unanimously expected to expand by 0.6% compared with the previous month, and food items rose by 1.9% year-on-year, ending the year-on-year decline in consecutive April; Service items increased by 0.8% year-on-year, 0.3 percentage points lower than that of the previous month. In terms of sub items, pork prices fell by 33.3% year-on-year, and the decline was significantly reduced by 8.1% compared with the previous month. The drag effect of pork prices on CPI was significantly weakened, which may be one of the reasons why CPI slightly exceeded expectations in April; Fresh fruits, vegetables and eggs increased by 14.1%, 24% and 12.1% year-on-year respectively, with the increase of 9.8%, 5.1% and 6.8% respectively, which shows that the current epidemic has not only impacted the supply chain of industrial production, but also superimposed the rise of energy prices with the restriction of important material flow nodes, and the rise of logistics costs is the main reason for the rise of food prices in April. Among non food items, the prices of gasoline and diesel increased by 2.8% and 3.0% respectively due to changes in international oil prices. Non food prices rose by 2.2%, the same as last month, affecting the CPI rise by about 1.78 percentage points. Among non food items, gasoline, diesel and LPG prices rose 29.0%, 31.7% and 26.9% respectively.\n\nOn a month on month basis, CPI rose 0.4% month on month basis in April, compared with the previous value of 0.00%. The month on month increase of food items changed from a decrease of 1.2% last month to an increase of 0.9%, and the month on month increase of non food items increased by 0.2%, which continued to shrink by 0.1% compared with the previous month. In terms of breakdown, pork prices have increased by 1.5% month on month (MOM) from 9.3% last month, ending the three-month mom decline in pork prices, and the inflection point of pork prices may come; In April, the rise of crude oil price did not continue to expand. Affected by this, the transportation price rose by 2.7% month on month, 4.4% lower than that of the previous month, and the driving effect of energy on CPI did not increase compared with the previous month.\n\nWe believe that in April, food items played a great role in driving CPI, and the driving role of energy was the same as that in March. However, the core CPI increased by 0.9% year-on-year, down 0.2 percentage points from the increase of the previous month, and increased by 0.1% month on month, indicating that China’s core CPI is still relatively stable and the inflation pressure is still in a controllable stage.\n\nIn April, PPI rose 8.0% year-on-year, and the market unanimously expected 7.8%. The increase was 0.3 percentage points lower than that of the previous month, and the year-on-year increase of means of production fell 0.4 percentage points to 10.3", "timestamp": 1653264712, "digest": "_qbfBqayps8t19XP-hNY0Glxt8bi4chNDK0BdMMo4BA", "contributor": "0xDb4230ac2C14caCc7243318Ba49dA7599De7D96e"}

{"id": "eyr_r5pEpxSV2_TD2wLkXOAKRfXS--l4xE3fgBYTQOQ", "title": "When will the devaluation of RMB end?", "body": "Zhang Jingjing: when will the devaluation of RMB end?\n\nToday, the RMB Offshore exchange rate reached 6.8, just below the range of 6.8-7.0 prompted by our report on April 23. So, is this wave of exchange rate depreciation over? At present, not yet. So, is devaluation necessarily a bad thing? In the short term, but not in the medium term.\n\nWhy did the RMB depreciate?\n\nWe understand the trend of RMB exchange rate from 2021q3 to 2022q1 using the three factor framework of US dollar, export share and risk aversion. The US dollar is the currency of all non US currencies β Factor; The share of exports reflects the economic competitiveness of most countries α Factor. From 2016 (after the 811 foreign exchange reform in 2015) to the first half of last year, the output value of RMB exchange rate obtained by the binary model is consistent with the actual value, indicating that the framework is effective. However, as shown in Figure 1, since Q3 last year, the output value deviates from the actual value. Previously, a friend mentioned to me that this deviation may be related to the decline in the demand for foreign exchange of domestic residents after the epidemic. However, if so, the output value should begin to differentiate from the actual value in Q2 2020. Obviously, this understanding is still inappropriate. After thinking for a long time, I think the third factor affecting the trend of RMB exchange rate in the departure stage of the two is likely to be the risk aversion factor. Last year, when delta virus appeared overseas in Q3, domestic economic life was not disturbed; At the beginning of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine at the end of February this year, the impact on China’s economy was also relatively low. Furthermore, while the risk aversion factor pushed up the US dollar, it also pushed up the RMB.\n\nIn fact, at this point, you can roughly understand the reasons for the current round of RMB exchange rate depreciation. The (passive) appreciation of the US dollar, the decline of China’s export share and the sudden domestic epidemic weakened the hedging function of the RMB.\n\nLet’s analyze it one by one:\n\nFirst, the US dollar continues to appreciate passively, making the RMB still under the pressure of bilateral depreciation against the US dollar.\n\nResume last year’s view: the pattern of Europe weak and the United States strong in 2021h2 and the expected reversal of this pattern. Back at the end of last year, we put forward the view that the US dollar index will start the devaluation journey in 2022, and then believed that the RMB exchange rate may fluctuate in both directions, but it will probably not depreciate against the US dollar. The reason at that time was that the H2 German election in 2021 heated up the political and economic uncertainty in Germany and even Europe, and the United States accelerated austerity without election, thus forming a pattern of weak Europe and strong United States. In addition, the delta of 2021q3 triggered the help of risk aversion, and the dollar index was particularly strong. Originally, there was uncertainty in this year’s US mid-term election, the political and economic stability in Europe was gradually stabilized, and the pattern of Europe being weak and the United States being strong was reversed; If the global epidemic cools down, the boost of safe haven demand to the US dollar will also be reversed.\n\nHowever, the Russian Ukrainian war and the outbreak of the epidemic in China have changed things. First of all, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has not only renewed the global risk aversion, but also directly hit Europe. The expectation of the European Central Bank to raise interest rates has been pushed again and again. At present, although President Lagarde gives the guidelines for raising interest rates in July, he still needs to observe the economic data in advance, which is still uncertain. In other words, the Russian Ukrainian war continued the pattern of Europe being weak and the United States being strong. In addition, the time point of the depreciation of the yen in early March was almost synchronized with the epidemic in China. It seems to be a coincidence, but there is a causal link. Affected by the high degree of aging, Japan’s current epidemic prevention policy is still the strictest among overseas countries, and its post epidemic production recovery is not as good as that of other countries. In addition, the characteristics of Japan are very similar to our midstream industry. We need to consider costs upward and demand downward. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has a negative impact on Japan’s cost side, while the Chinese epidemic has further constrained Japan’s foreign demand and become a catalyst for the depreciation of the yen. The sum of euro and yen accounts for 71.2% of the US dollar index. Under the weak situation of Europe and Japan, the US dollar index appreciated passively, but it also made non US currencies such as RMB bear the pressure of bilateral depreciation against the US dollar.\n\nSecondly, the export share is bound to decline, and the RMB should also be moderately depreciated against the package, at least not suitable for continued appreciation.\n\nThe obstruction of overseas production after the epidemic has increased China’s export share from 13.1% in 2019 to 15.2% in 2021. During this period, the real effective exchange rate of the RMB rose sharply by 7.9%, the highest in the world, and the real effective exchange rate of the US dollar only appreciated by 2.9% in the same period. With the recovery of overseas production, we had expected China’s export share to below 15% this year. Of course, the domestic outbreak may also be the catalyst for the devaluation of the RMB exchange rate. On the one hand, it confirms the trend of the decline in export share, and may even lead to the acceleration of the short-term decline; On the other hand, economic fundamentals are indeed constrained, and the epidemic has also increased the difficulty of stabilizing domestic growth. If we continue to maintain stability against the US dollar and then appreciate against the package, it is not only unreasonable, but also very detrimental to the competitiveness of China’s export enterprises after the epidemic cools down.\n\nMoreover, the sudden epidemic has heated up the short-term uncertainty of the domestic economy and weakened the risk aversion function of the RMB. The RMB exchange rate is driven by three factors and returns to two factors (US dollar and export share).\n\nThe epidemic has exacerbated the short-term uncertainty of China’s economy. From last year’s experience, we can see that where the epidemic breaks out and the economy is more impacted, there is a risk of exchange rate depreciation in any economy. This outbreak in China naturally weakened the hedging function of RMB temporarily, and the RMB exchange rate returned from the three factor driving logic of US dollar, export share and hedging to the two factor driving logic of US dollar and export share.\n\nIs the devaluation of RMB over?\n\nIn our report on April 23, we mentioned that the Q2 RMB exchange rate may depreciate slightly to 6.8-7.0. Today, the offshore has reached 6.8. Does it mean that the depreciation of the exchange rate will come to an end? I’m afraid we have to wait.\n\nFirst look at the export share. The sharp decline of export growth in April to a small single digit may not be a flash in the pan. According to the current situation, the export data in May may may not be ideal. However, the export share is obviously not the key to the trend of RMB. After all, the elasticity of this factor is significantly weaker than that of the US dollar.\n\nLet’s look at the dollar index. As mentioned above, this wave of appreciation of the US dollar index is not the result of the Fed’s interest rate hike and table contraction. It is more non us too bad. Looking back, there must be a huge relative change between the relatively stable United States and the relatively damaged non United States in order to reverse the strong dollar. For example, the constraints of the Russian Ukrainian conflict on Europe and the end of the impact of the Chinese epidemic on the economies of China and Japan have turned from non-U.S. to strong to suppress the dollar;", "timestamp": 1653266154, "digest": "XfumXuS-D5aEg4PpOcR5Reh6VNVLoj009hEXEepaWh4", "contributor": "0x1C8735AE4d5f46F884b5011496FBf4a0D4cd4472"}

{"id": "k2C14ziZNJgfh58uhx1ITDasV3zuJ5OTdzx660FQfn4", "title": "The Funding Cooperative DAO: unleashing the collective power of founders", "body": "> *TL;DR - founders need to come together to balance power dynamics with sources of capital and to make real the world we all imagine. We can do that through some basic DeFi applied to DAO formation - instead of “just” creating a token to govern **one** DAO, what if we linked arms and built a token and a DAO amongst **many** of us? How could this pattern become a primitive used by many web3 communities to balance the forces, increase founder support and diversification, and fund the growth of a much larger and more inclusive web3?  This is our mission at [the Funding Cooperative DAO]() and our first group of DAOs is gathering, arm in arm -> join us now.*\n\nThere has been a lot of talk about the power dynamic shifting towards founders during the heights of the recent macroeconomic cycle. Funding is up, company formation is up, and most importantly the number of engaged developers is up, and valuations *were* up. Data from a16z’s recent Crypto Report suggest the shift to web3 has been accelerating.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YC4El9kA-zvAJXzEbjbga.png?height=566&width=1368)\n\nAnd now the cycle is turned. As the tide recedes we are going to learn a lot about how resilient the economy really is. And countless founders are going to find that to their investors, they are just one of many investments. The start-up that to a founder feels like a reflection of their deepest purpose - may become a victim of triage in a venture fund’s emergency ward, left in the hallway as nature takes its course.\n\nweb3 is supposed to be different. Built on the foundation of resilient, distributed, open-source, and autonomous systems such as Ethereum and communities that proudly disregard the status, privilege, and gatekeeping of the traditional economy - surely we will prosper even as the web2 economy undergoes another bout of ‘creative destruction.’\n\nAnd yet what about our foundations?  How solid are our foundations?  \n\nSpecifically - founders. How can we collectively find and support more founders, the true basis of all innovation? How are we treating them in web3?  The path of a web3 founder or technical builder isn’t as pretty as we might all think.\n\n### Builders want to build: \n\nIn the words of a prolific builder and Funding Cooperative DAO member who has launched a number of projects:\n\n> *“I don’t want to answer questions like ‘wen token?’  At least not yet.  I don’t want to spend one freaking second thinking about ‘token go up.’ I don’t want to hire a lawyer, do a funding deck, and see the power seeping from the developers to the investors. I want to build.”*\n\nThese words echo what we have heard in many interviews over the last several months. And they resemble the experience of many of us in helping to found and foster open source projects back in our web2 days. Despite the ever-growing number of projects that help in DAO formation and management and the success of projects like GitCoin and SeedCamp, builders are not yet founding web3 projects at anything close to the pace we all would like to see.  \n\nHere are a few statistics about the relative scale of web3 - so far:\n\n* 2021 was a year of crypto and web3 hype - and yet according to data from Crunchbase, only 5% of venture deals were in the web3 space.  \n* Deep Dao as of May 2022, only lists 91 DAOs with over $1 million assets under management - and approximately 50% of the total AUM is concentrated in only three DAOs.  \n* As pointed out by A16Z in their recent state of crypto report, the AUM of all of DeFi would rank as the 31st largest bank in the United States.\n* On average there were just over 15,000 businesses receiving an employer ID number just in the United States each day. These are employers that are likely to actually employ someone as opposed to S corps which are individual companies - there are many more of these.  By comparison there are only 4,834 projects listed on DeepDao.  \n\n***There are 3x more “normie companies” founded in the US in a day than there are DAOs in existence.***  \n\nWe have a long, long way to go for web3 to become the favored home of founders and especially of those that are technology-focused. \n\nHere are some of the DAO founder pain points that we are building to solve:\n\n* Diversification: \n  * “My DAO contributors - and investors - have their fingers in many pies.  I’m all-in over here at this DAO.  What happens to me and my co-founders if it only does ok?” \n  * “We wanted to diversify our treasury but a) liquidity remains low so sales crush the price and b) the token holders are short-term focused, they want ‘token go up….So they shoot down our proposals and push us to hype more and HUDL HUDL HUDL.”\n* Loneliness:\n  * We *all* have imposter syndrome.  And we *all* have experienced, some of us more than others, gaslighting by investors and others who would profit if only you saw the world their way and acquiesced to their strategies. While web3 vibes are generally positive and welcoming, founders told us that there are few safe places to talk about DAO growth and challenges with others that are at a similar stage in their founding journey.  \n* Power law and the very few chances founders have to win:\n  * Those of us that think in terms of economics and finance are all too aware of the power-law nature of returns in traditional venture capital.  It turns out that all of the returns to venture capital investors are contributed by the top several percent of companies. Returns to founders are even more skewed, meaning the vast majority of founders would have been better off if they had taken a reasonably well-paying job. \n  * If each start-up takes 4-5 years for a committed founder, they may only have 4-5 potential start-ups in their life. On the other side of the table, venture capitalists always already have dozens of companies in their portfolios. Given that - which side of the table is more likely to experience the transformative impact of a top 1% or .1% company?  And how does that reinforce centralization?\n\n### Helping builders through a DAO of DAOs and a DAO of DAOs of DAOs?\n\nOur approach is pretty simple. DAOs of DAOs. Nested DAOs. DAOs all the way down.  And diversification.  \n\nLet’s gain diversification, community, support, and a higher likelihood of a massive outcome by using some web3 primitives to create a shared DAO amongst a portfolio of DAOs. And let’s form a DAO - we call it the Funding Cooperative DAO - to recruit, select, launch and support those portfolios.  \n\nEach DAO of DAOs consists of several DAOs that have passed through diligence. Through token swaps and other primitives, we seed for them a DAO that is jointly owned by them. We also call this the “cohort DAO” as a working title. Each cohort DAO represents a season of DAOs that have joined the Funding Cooperative.\n\nThe Funding Cooperative DAO is a DAO of DAOs of DAOs. “FC DAO” exists to improve the processes before, during, and after the creation of the cohort DAOs. Concretely this means we are building:\n\n* A better graph to recruit web2 and web3 builders to think about founding DAOs - emphasizing outreach to underrepresented groups and partnering with many others in the web3 ecosystem with a similar mission\n* Customized to purpose token swap primitives, building on existing token swaps\n  * While one to one token swaps are a solved problem, we are extending these to many to one and one to many swaps, all performed atomically \n* Customized to purpose token creation and launch processes\n  * Thank you to the Juicebox crew for being so responsive and creative\n* Partnerships with many existing communities that nurture DAOs, including MovementDAO and others, as places where members of cohort DAOs can thrive; we work together with partners on all phases of the cohort DAO life cycle from recruitment to formation and growth.\n\n### Ok DAO of DAOs of DAOs: “wen token?”\n\nIf you have read this far along, thank you!  Here are a few ways you can participate immediately.\n\nFirst, join the Funding Cooperative DAO.  Drop-in to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/vUGcJrqh3Q) and say hi. Everyone who joins and helps out in a substantial way will receive an airdrop; also we have basic payment rails set up and will be adding more core contributors in the weeks to come. As an example, one of your first quests could be helping to execute an OP-inspired retroactive community airdrop: Merkle tree FTW!  We have a number of software projects underway or kicking off and we are building out our own DAO structure as we increasingly decentralize. Engineers and DAO operators are especially in need.  \n\nSecondly, soon we will be talking about the participation of several amazing early stage DAOs and their founders. In contributing to one of us you are contributing to all of us. We will have a series of blogs and tweets about each of these DAOs in the weeks to come. Stay tuned and stay hyped.  \n\nThird, builders please apply and suggest other builders!  Our process for review is increasingly automated - within a day or two, we will give you directional feedback.  Basically, we are looking for technical depth and demonstrated trustworthiness, we are not trying to be gatekeepers as much as we are a mechanism for trustworthy technical DAO founders to link arms and bootstrap together the diversification, liquidity, and community we all need.\n\n**Apply now!  <https://tally.so/r/m68JLe>**  \n\nOur vision is of a world in which web3 helps address age-old challenges to innovation, including centralization of capital, gatekeeping of opportunity, and founder stress and insecurity. We think the Funding Cooperative DAO can play a small role - that grows over time with your help - in making web3 the center of innovation for decades to come. Let’s work together to build a DAO that helps invent the future we all want to see.  \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1653266164, "digest": "_pvyaQmJs-FoSqC-YzNTD-NKZV9l448aP4XqSuvPFAA", "contributor": "0xEdeCAB02F65AD9dB661f5fA5629c3d57Ca8B26c5"}
{"id": "mh9KC7yAstWQZ-DXHmbUOh9Zy65M9mCdcf4zEAgA_JU", "title": "How we found our Teddy :)", "body": "Last summer Sam FaceTime'd me & was talking to me about NFT’s. I knew what NFT’s were before we had that conversation but just never paid attention to it. He said : bro this space is perfect for you, don’t ask me why just go on twitter & join any NFT twitter space and you’ll find your journey, I am so excited to see where this story goes from here…\n\nI still remember saying : bro it’s 4 in the morning rn on a Saturday night and you’re telling me to go on twitter space rn and follow some monkey’s??? lol\n\nIn my mind I was like this dude’s lit & out of his right frame of mind. Finishing our sentences he said Teddy trust me, I know you and I am telling you this is a one way ticket to the life you have always dreamed but never lived and opportunities like this are very hard to find. I just laughed at it and I was like I’ll think about it and let you know…\n\nThen after a week I was playing soccer with Shadow in my backyard thinking about what Sam said the other day and tbh I enjoyed hearing him & everything he had to say with enthusiasm over the potential of NFT’s. Btw Sam is a well known artist in the space, and now after spending all this time in this space I get it why he was hyper that day. Anyways, then I went on my twitter and switched my profile form private to public. I joined my first twitter space, It was with @NFTPrince & NFTsquirrels. Both are living legends and I respect them a lot. They shared tons of selfless advice to me on first day without even knowing who I was, what my real name is, or how I looked like. The knowledge was so valuable that basically I’ve never been rugged / scammed in this space till date. \n\nAfter spending some time in different spaces and observing how everything is working in this ecosystem, I focused on the fundamentals, the way people interact and react with certain things, what values they carried, and how do they find their feeling of importance. It was’nt very difficult for me to figure these things out because of my knowledge & experience with Social Media for over 5 years. I grew 36 million+ followers on Instagram via different entertainment pages and a network of over 250 million+ followers via networking in less than 6 months with just 2,000$ to start with from my college dorm.\n\nDuring that time Bored Ape’s were just flying and they still are but the vibes were immaculate last year you can’t deny that. I literally did a PHD on them and I was just astounded by their story but I was able to relate a lot of it to my life, it was so inspiring and fascinating. I was thinking so much about it, that even in my dreams I was seeing NFT’s all around me and my life changed the night of September 30 with that one lucid dream, I decided to do a project to share my story so that others can relate to it and be a part of it. \n\n( Note : This was’nt the main reason for me to do a NFT project. My main goal was and is still the same today that I want to leave this NFT space better than how I found it. )\n\nBack to the story, why Teddy? Well obviously. My friend’s call me Teddy and Teddies have been a part of everyone’s childhood and I believe people will hold on to that tradition forever. They provide us the comfort & companionship, a friend to talk to, and it’s not just kids who benefit from the positive effects of a comforting Teddy squeeze. Teddies are just universal and timeless.\n\nI put all of my traits and character and imagination’s in the art, from my expressions to the way I dress. Some of the assets are added for the aesthetics of the collection. I am not an artist but since I was the character I worked with few freelance artist’s to bring my idea on paper. They asked me for a sketch to give an idea of what I wanted and this is what I sent them lmao 😂😂😂😂😂😂\n\n![ That Yu-Gi-Oh and LV belt part has my heart lmaoooo😭😭😭. Tbh this image is still a lot better than my first one. Btw I am not rich lol, I don't have a AP watch or fancy items.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p7SJwXfpBXm-_G9fiTlu0.jpg?height=1280&width=960)\n\n![This looks decent lol. Lot better than what I came up with.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vxl5Z9dogU0G7wxHt-euI.png?height=1280&width=720)\n\n![That's me on the Left! Dw I am doxed to all our past holder's and lot of people in NFT space know me irl. My identity is just not public in the space atm. I'll reveal it when time is right.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CL1JyGEQS_ynX1v0M1WGn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nBack to the story, so once I got this I reached out to few professional artist’s in my network and I worked with multiple of them to find the perfect Teddy. We wanted to stick with 2D because 3D art is great but the market seemed to be doing well with 2D more than 3D collections. Ofcs art style isn’t the main reason for it but it does play a role. But then I am like let’s take the challenge and create something insane. During the time when I started the project, their were’nt any 3D project’s coming out just yet nor there were any noticeable Teddy Bear collections popping as long as I know. So then we decided to turn this into 3D. During this process one 3D artist reached out to me in my DM’s of one our meme page asking to collab, I am like okay cool lets give it a shot and see what you got. \n\n![This is what he came up with as base model. 💀💀💀](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FcshCcWqBzufElk9puKnW.png?height=772&width=778)\n\nYeah he just lost me on that base model. If ur surprised, I did’nt see this coming either, when I saw it for the first time I was out of words just like you are rn. I seriously had no comments on this image. So yeah I had to say no to that dude and look for another artist. The fact that people fake their LinkedIn and show you proof of work of other artist is just hilarious. So I asked one of my friend on telegram if he knew any artist to connect me and he did. \n\n![Idk tbh, it was just not it.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z3yiJzSTaGmqQdaHZroTJ.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nIt just did’nt feel right going with the full body at this point, gave pfp style a shot and see how it does. Initially the idea was, we will do pfp collection and in a seperate contract and we will give the holders full body version of their Teddy so they have both and can use it the way they like whether to animate or so with the source file…\n\n![I finally said yes to this one and made a deal with the artist and gave her an upfront amount for her time that we both agreed on. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ef-d0SnN5nrZH4EpHIfbn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThe decided to upfront because she told me she had financial instability and urgently need of money for rent and expenses so she would’nt be able to work full time on this project and it would take lot longer to complete the collection than what I was expecting. Plus I genuinely wanted to help her regardless of if she would work for the project or not due to her situation. \n\n![My mind, Her ability.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q7q8YdENYDP5zDlajLh05.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nWe decided to fully render and rigg the collection in the end after all the traits and assets are illustrated and confirmed so that their isn't any confusions and nothing is left out. But unfortunately when she submitted, the quality of collection turned out terrible atleast from my pov. I communicated it with our community and told them that ‘guys we do not have the collection fully rigged and its in between 2D and 3D so we would have to pause the project for now until we find another artist and see how things go from there’. \n\nBut then I was also out of funds because I put everything I had in the project initially. So I communicated this with the community in our discord and 34 people ended up minting 100 regardless of the situation. 10 were minted for team and 1 was minted by me personally to participate in the process just like any other member of community. They knew that mint had zero value and won’t have a secondary market value but yet they still supported. So that moment onwards my belief in the project became even stronger and quitting was never an option no matter what situation I go through. The collection won’t ever be revealed because I don’t believe in trying to sell some bullshit to people just to pocket some eth. In trying to sell NFT’s I am not going to sell my character, tf I look like? ZagaBond? There is a big fat difference between failing and abandoning your project. We don’t give up around here…This project is my dream and it like a child to me. I want to be the best out there in anything I do in life. Whether if it is playing soccer or anything that I hold dear too I give my absolute best to win. When I play soccer I don’t play to just participate I play to make difference, I play to dominate the field. \n\n[https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub](https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub)\n\nSo yeah that was my first failure in NFT space, I learned a lot from that failure. The most important thing was that when starting a business do everything you can to gather great people that have the same drive & BELIEVE IN YOUR VISION as you do. Because in the end all a business is a group of people dedicated to provide service or product to people. Take care of your team like your family & they’ll take care of your business & customers. \n\nThen after I did an outreach again and managed to find a team of 4 professional 3D artist’s. Their past ventures have involved working with brands like Puma, Bangs and Lulu Lemon. Their Identities are anon as they wish to keep it that way but I have confirmed the veracity of their credentials. When I presented this entire idea and vision of the collection to them, after hearing me they instantly said yes and told be that we believe in you and we’re gonna make the best collection of 2022. We started working on it the same day and even with this team, I worked 1 on 1 with the team over screen shares for every single trait’s and asset’s and outcomes are just fantastic. Look It does’nt matter what people think of it but we do believe it is one of the greatest NFT collections that will ever be deployed on Blockchain. We’ve put our blood, sweat and tears in this collection as a team day in and day out. The collection is timeless & it will age well I can make that one promise for sure. \n\n![This collection is dedicated to someone who does'nt need to own it. It's a dream come true. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wKl-h3xgt9G73xjvxW_7_.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThere is no bigger feeling than making your dream come true and the story will never have an end to be honest. I am just the captain of the boat as of now but at some point I want to hand the dream over to the community in a position that even if I am not present the story live forever as long as their is imagination left in this world. \n\nBig hug & Thank you for your time and consideration for reading this. I genuinely appreciate your presence here with all my heart.

URLを確認する\n3. 疑わしいと思ったら焦りに負けず、チャットで正しいかを確認する(できない場合はscamの可能性高い)\n4. サイトのmint数、送り先コントラクトを確認し、その数に不都合がないかを確認する\n\n## DMは詐欺！！！！DMは詐欺！！！！DMは詐欺！！！\n\n### 1対1の取引をしない\n\nまず、DMで相手とやり取りすること自体リスクがあります。誰もが見えるパブリックな場所で交渉しましょう。交渉するにしても相手のリンクを踏まないようにしましょう。\n\nscamの数としては私見では Telegram > Discord > Twitterです。まずDMは詐欺前提であることを忘れず心置きなくブロックもしましょう。\n\nDMに関係するscamには思いついた限りでいくつかのscamがあります。\n\n1. 偽mintサイトへ誘導\n2. あなたのNFTがほしいからと交渉する\n3. クリエイター向けに詳細をpdfなど別途ファイルで添付する\n4. MODになってほしいからと偽discordリンクに招待、その後verifyのためと謳ったscamサイトに誘導し、Discordのトークンを抜き取りアカウントを奪われます。\n5. トラブルに会った場合、サポートするという内容のscamがTwitter、Discord、Telegramに大量に来ますが、1対1のサポートはまずscamです。\n\n## 偽リンクを踏まない\n\nGoogle Search、Twitterの広告には偽プロジェクトを謳い、あなたの資産を奪おうとしてきます。\n\n対策としては、公式Twitter、公式Discord、coingecko、Defillamaなど信頼の置ける複数のサイトからURLを確認して飛ぶようにします。ブックマークも非常に有益です。\n\n公式Twitterはフォロワーの数、共通でフォローしてる人の数から判断してください。フォロー数にもよりますが、0\\~10人程度なら怪しくて、たとえ数万人居たとしてもフォロワーを購入しています。\n\n### Twitter\n\n偽のサポート、公式マークが付いている、フォロワーが多い。どれも全部関係ないです。共通フォローが多いかを確認しましょう。\n\n公式を装った詐欺への誘導もよくあります。紛らわしいので非フォロワー、非フォローからの通知をoffにしましょう。\n\n### 偽のDiscordリンク\n\n![doodles公式](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z54azGgPUHad9zG1kYIen.png?height=383&width=759)\n\n例えば、DoodlesのDiscordリンクはdiscord.gg/doodlesです。これはサーバーブースターというDiscordの機能によってレベル3を達成すると招待コードを好きな文字列に変更できます。\n\n例えば、僕が大きなNFTプロジェクト(akashi)を持っていて、50人だけ招待したいとします。通常discordの招待はランダムな文字列になり、abcdefgというコードを50人の制限をかけてTwitterで配布します。51人目以降はそのdiscordには招待コードが切れましたというメッセージが表示されます。\n\nここにscamを狙っているAさんがいるとします。僕のabcdefgというコードが切れた後だと、ブーストしているレベル3のdiscordサーバーはabcdefgという招待コードを作成できます。それを狙って、abcdefgというコードで偽akashiサーバーに誘導します。そこで偽サイトから(以下略)\n\n### Telegram\n\n自分が被害にあったのはこれです。公式を名乗った偽のtelegramがたくさんあります。\n\nさあ名前だけを見てどれが公式かわかりますか？僕にはわかりませんが、選択されているのと、Announcements以外は偽のセールが行われていました。\n\nTelegramはもうscamの温床になってるので、自分は殆ど使っていません。偽公式に簡単に辿れるのでかなり注意が必要です。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JO7HU5KI1MJ0zMNCGPrpC.png?height=379&width=567)\n\n### Instagram\n\nInstagramには公式以外にもたくさんの偽物アカウントが存在し、Twitterと違って、数万人フォロワーがいることが多いです。中には偽物のほうがフォロワー数が多いケースも有るため、気をつけなければなりません。\n\nInstagramが一番怖いです。\n\n### Openseaの偽コレクション\n\n1. 公式マークは関係ない\n2. 公式Discord、Twitterに記載されているofficial linkからOpenseaに飛ぶ\n3. コントラクトアドレスでOpenseaの検索をする\n4. 安い価格に飛びつかず、出来高を確認し、10ETH以下なら偽のコレクションと判断する(そもそも流動性のないプロジェクトに飛びつかないよう)\n\n最近Phantom Network(PxN)という大きなプロジェクトのmintが開始されました。もちろんそれを狙って、偽コレクションも始動します。\n\n0x160c404b2b49cbc3240055ceaee026df1e8497a0はPxNのコントラクトで事前に公開されていました。以下画像2枚目にある通り既に**偽のコレクション**は消されていますが、偽のコレクションで100ETH以上の取引がありました。\n\n[https://twitter.com/dingalingts/status/1522055650028978176](https://twitter.com/dingalingts/status/1522055650028978176)\n\nなお既に犯人は特定されています。\n\n[https://twitter.com/Serpent/status/1522059672886251521](https://twitter.com/Serpent/status/1522059672886251521)\n\n## 偽サイトにアクセスした場合\n\nウォレット接続はただRead権限を与えるだけのはずなので問題ないです。署名(signature)、トランザクション、approveを行うと、そのウォレットを危険に晒すことになります。仮に行った場合は、revokeする、そのウォレットからすべての資産を移動するなどして二度と使わないなどの対応を取り、資産を守ります。\n\nrevoke先\n\n[https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker](https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker)\n\nappriveの仕組み\n\n[https://youtu.be/N05FR_e7124?t=949](https://youtu.be/N05FR_e7124?t=949)\n\n### Metamaskを捨ててRabbyを利用する\n\nセキュリティ対策がたくさん盛り込まれています。これだけで9割は防げるはずです。\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/yakisobaminister.eth/nKCSnpvrobSShtdESJArIUwOIXYUR4exyu1O4Opkooc](https://mirror.xyz/yakisobaminister.eth/nKCSnpvrobSShtdESJArIUwOIXYUR4exyu1O4Opkooc)\n\n### 偽のNFT、トークン\n\n例えばですが、以下のようなよく知らないコレクションがhiddenやopenseaそのままに送信されることがあります。それらをhiddenに動かしたり、別のアドレスに送ってしまうとウォレット内資産が取られる危険性があるため、触らずにそのままにしておきましょう。\n\n![偽のコレクション](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KfRFbQOYObr6HXrC3BqXd.png?height=506&width=1114)\n\n![謎エアドロップ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XEBYfUFHfMJ5IWjE1UrSP.png?height=507&width=1229)\n\n![アクセスしたらお金上げる系](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YvPrQ4W_Aeuc-hMYTJQXq.png?height=283&width=1130)\n\n### テストネット\n\nNFTだけやってる人にありがちですが、ETHメインネットとテストネットのトークンを同一視してしまうことがあります。テストネットトークンは誰でも無限に受け取れて、それ自体に価値がないので、rapsten,kovan,rinkbyなどのトークンで取引を成立してはいけません。必ず相手のリンクは踏んだり、トークンの送金、受取をせず、相手にできないと言われてもopensea、looksrare、x2y2など公式のリンクから出品しましょう。(そもそも1v1で相手にしない)\n\n[https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/)\n\n### フィッシングメール\n\nこれがなんだかんだ簡単で引っかかる人が多いです。最近はLedgerのメールアドレスが流出して、フィッシングメールが届くようになったようです。\n\n基本的にWeb3ではメールを使いません。メールが届くのはサービスに登録したものです。Openseaから取引完了のメールが届くでしょうけど、僕はフィッシングと紛らわしいため全部ブロックしています。Web3とは関係ないと思いきや、Appleアカウントのフィッシングから資産を取られたケースもあります。Metamask(メール登録箇所ない)から来ることもありますが、まずありえないので、定期的にメールアドレスの整理を行いましょう。疑わしい場合は誰かに確認を。\n\n### 番外編 偽giveaway\n\n本物に混じって偽giveawayが行われていることがあります。今だと日本ではstepnが多いですが、人気NFTプロジェクトにも例があります。\n\nフォロワーを無料で獲得するためにやっているため、野放しにするといずれ詐欺アカウントに変容し、詐欺に加担することにつながるので、避けましょう。自分は偽giveaway参加者はいつか自分も被害に合うかもしれないと思って全てブロックしてます。", "timestamp": 1653266545, "digest": "7a9z0TakP7y9xHb7kocA8lHDpBu9-1PaaHnqfib2M14", "contributor": "0xAe74399237E02458aa42283e7c3ef2929AD4896C"}

金融就是金钱的融通，你的钱放着也没啥用，但市场上总有人需要它。现实生活中生产需要钱、消费需要钱、买房/买车需要钱、公司发展也需要钱，你把钱借给他们，钱就能生钱了。\n\n金融就是把钱放到能生钱的地方！\n\n可是你把钱放给隔壁老王，他跑路了怎么办？\n\n如果有受国家监管的银行来作中间方，你的钱就稳得一批了！银行拿你的钱贷给需要它的人从中赚取利差，就形成了存贷业务。\n\n你再也不用担心钱要不回来了，但问题又来了：\n\n利息实在太低了！\n\n......\n\n咦！对面的BTC还挺赚钱的——盘它！\n\n几年之前我们大多还是以场外交易（OTC）的方式进行的，交易所提供的OTC服务类似支付宝，大家都习惯直接支付法币购买BTC，卖出的时候也直接换回法币。（我最开始买BTC的时候也是这样的......）\n\n![N久前的coincola截图，BTC 5w RMB](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EJrrUGYG9OiFuCKpNUNcy.png?height=247&width=720)\n\n但这实在太麻烦了，每次买卖下单都要等待很久，时常还会错过响应，就算顺利成交也会损失一笔不菲的手续费。\n\n你也可以不换回法币，交易所后来又提供了币币交易，哪个币涨得快就换哪个币，涨不动了再换回来。 但这又带来一些问题：\n\n* 当你想把BTC换成ETH的时候，就要理解BTC/ETH交易对，这对于习惯了法币定价的韭菜来说就懵圈了，0.0385这种价格以及买卖方向都不容易整懂。\n* 当行情下跌的时候换任何币都是跌，难道又得换回法币？\n* BTC波动太大了，不适合用来给其它币定价。\n\n这个时候整个币圈都需要一个锚定美元的币，方便韭菜们搞钱。于是USDT就诞生了，所有新韭菜入场，都会先买USDT。\n\n牛市开始的时候韭菜们把手上的U换成各种币，人声鼎沸的时候又把手上的币卖成U，不是急需钱的时候就放着等待时机，机会来了又能及时跟进。\n\n有了U韭菜们炒币更方便了，钱也不是那么急于变现了；有了U交易所玩左手导右手赚手续费的游戏也更容易了，钱也留在自己的盘子里了。\n\n不但是韭菜需要一种靠谱的稳定币，交易所更需要。\n\n整个币圈对于稳定币的需求都是巨大的！\n\n### 机制、漏洞 & 风险\n\nUSDT是泰达 (Tether) 发行的锚定美元的稳定币。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PwitJHZNQFLAcX8XLy7wC.png?height=216&width=720)\n\n美联储印钱还得找个理由呢， 你随便一家公司就能发行加密世界的美金？\n\n明天张三发个USDX、后天李四发个USDY、大后天王五发个USDZ，这岂不乱套了！\n\n也不是，泰达声称 (骗你) 他们发行的每个USDT背后都抵押了等值的1美金。\n\n至此加密世界里USDT被当作 1:1 锚定美元的稳定币，当市场对稳定币有大量需求的时候，泰达抵押相应的美金铸造USDT，当市场需要变现的时候也能销毁掉对应的USDT换回美金。\n\n虽然这里面至少有一半是骗你的，但简单理解这就是USDT运行的机制，USDT之所以能当加密货币的美金用，就是因为它背后抵押了（骗你有）真金白银的美金！\n\n机制都是有漏洞的！\n\n只是触发的条件不同而已！\n\n......\n\n多年的沉淀，USDT也成了流通量最大的稳定币，借2021年的大牛市发行量已突破800亿。 USDT没有任何审计机构审计，背后真有800亿美金抵押？\n\nCrypto圈子里没有一个人相信！\n\n如果这个市场上同时有很多人对泰达都没信心了，去问它兑换美金，就最多只有一小部分人能够如愿以偿，大多数无法变现的USDT就会在争相抛售的过程中变得一文不值。\n\n这就是风险，当然大家都还没觉得它会发生！\n\n随着Crypto市场的发展壮大，整个市场稳定币体量也与日俱增。\n\n市场这么大，谁不会做稳定币呢？对吧\n\n于是就出现了USDC、DAI、BUSD......包括最近很火的UST，这里无非分为2个派系，1个是超额抵押稳定币，一个是算法稳定币。\n\n我们今天是来学习LUNA和UST的，稳定币另外写！\n\n### Terra、LUNA & UST\n\nTerra是基于Cosmos SDK搭建的一个公链项目，主网于 2019 年发布，使用DPoS权益证明共识协议，创始人Do Kwon拥有斯坦福计算机科学专业背景，韩国人在本轮牛市出尽风头。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Rx3zonxB-ioXK8CiOcpeG.png?height=315&width=720)\n\nTerra的原生治理代币就是这几天币圈崩盘的主角之一：**LUNA**，Terra生态最大的特色就是它的算法稳定币，可以创建追踪任何法定货币的稳定币：\n\n* TerraCNY (Chinese yuan)\n* TerraEUR (euro)\n* TerraJPY (Japanese yen)\n* TerraKWR (South Korean kwon)\n* TerraSDR (the International Monetary Fund)\n\n对的，你没看错，还有人民币！\n\n但是其中体量最大、能被大家操心起来的就是TerraUSD，也就是这次币圈崩盘的另一个主角：**UST**，很明显项目方对UST的定位是锚定美金。\n\n前面我们讲到过USDT能够锚定美金，是因为每1个USDT背后都抵押了1美金（就当它是吧），那UST凭什么能锚定美金呢？\n\n这就是Terra风骚的地方：\n\n***靠机制套利！***\n\nTerra稳定币机制就是LUNA-UST双币互燃：\n\n* 所有用户都可以在Terra平台燃烧1个UST铸造价值1美金的LUNA\n* 所有用户都可以在Terra平台燃烧价值1美金的LUNA铸造1个UST\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xLKvJEuwZRXrWsi1yFBU8.png?height=340&width=720)\n\n最开始项目方还在这个过程中收铸币税，也就是只燃烧其中一部分，其余的存入社区，后续会被用来投资扩大Terra生态系统效用的应用程序和服务......\n\n前面我也说过机制都是有漏洞的，有的情况它会正向运转，而有的情况会相反！而坏的情况会不会发生都可以归结为机制设计下的概率问题，作为设计者应该规避那些能够触发悲剧的情况，如果规避不了就不应该让它诞生。这是后话......\n\n我们还是先来看UST是怎么稳定的。\n\n有2种情况：（举例不考虑摩擦损耗）\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JUhGamdN7B_b9daOPzx14.png?height=271&width=720)\n\n1. **1 UST(= 1.1美金) > 1美金**\n\n   这个时候套利者可以卖出1UST，换取价值1.1美金的LUNA，然后回到Terra平台铸造1.1个UST，这个过程套利者赚到了0.1个UST，重复这个过程直到无利可图。\n\n   套利者卖出铸造的UST将价格拉回1美金，同时燃烧LUNA也使得LUNA流通量减少价值提升。\n2. **1 UST(=0.9美金) < 1美金**\n\n   这个时候套利者可以在Terra平台用1个UST铸造价值1美金的LUNA，在市场上卖掉并买入1.11个UST，这个过程套利者赚了0.11个UST，重复这个过程直到无利可图。\n\n   套利者买入UST将价格拉回1美金，同时铸造的LUNA也使得LUNA虚市值进一步提升。\n\n这个机制有没有问题？\n\n当然！有什么问题？\n\n**（1）信心不足**\n\nUSDT、USDC的抵押物是现实世界中的美金，DAI最开始的抵押物是价值币ETH，而UST是不依赖外部抵押物的算法稳定币，持有者如果有一天集体对UST没信心了，想要变现离场的唯一有效途径就是其背后的资产LUNA，因为Terra的协议保障1个UST可以换回1美金的LUNA。\n\n这就要求LUNA的实际市值（而非虚市值）要大于UST的账面市值，否则持有UST的人就会没有信心，急于换回LUNA或其他代币保值。这次的崩盘证明LUNA的市值至少要是UST的10-20倍。\n\n最蛋疼的是2个币都是Terra自己的，你自己整出来的一个东西给自己整出来的另一个东西背书，你自己捣鼓出来一个项目代币作为自己捣鼓出来的另一个项目代币背后的资产。\n\n这种左右互搏术只有武侠片敢演。来，左边跟我一起画个龙，在你右边画一道彩虹，额\\~龙还可以变彩虹，彩虹也可以变回龙。\n\n用屁股想都觉得哪儿都不对劲！\n\n**（2）高度中心化 & 产出不可控**\n\nBTC为什么在Crypto世界的对标黄金，是因为它的产出是严格限制的，BTC的共识协议保证它平均10分钟产出一个区块，每个区块BTC的产量也是固定的，基本不可能随意增发，其极高的存量/产量比，决定了持有BTC作为价值存储是可以绝对放心的。\n\n而UST、LUNA的机制是绝对做不到的！\n\nTerra可以说是一个高度控盘的中心化项目，其共识机制是基于DPOS的。总代币量中30%都是留给项目方的，20%作为储备金、20%支持Terra应用场景，能够明确在市面上流动中的只有30%。给团队及生态合作伙伴如此高的分配比例，在众多Defi项目中都是比较罕见的。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uCq-zMEiDdSrd08YU8rfi.png?height=268&width=720)\n\n网上也有文章说到Terra的区块链浏览器不支持查询LUNA地址排名、持仓比例等，这在区块链的世界里是极不透明的，这都Web3了难道还要求韭菜相信项目方的道德自律？\n\n如此中心化、不透明的项目要把LUNA的价格炒上去是很简单的，炒上去对团队、投资人、合作伙伴都是好事，2021年底LUNA达到200亿美金的市值，而这个时候利益共同体们持有的虚市值如果直接卖出是不能利益最大化的。\n\n但创始人是有办法的！\n\nTerra销毁8867.5万LUNA铸造UST的提案通过（其实就是Do kwon们自己决定的），11月20日UST增发完成，Luna总市值从200亿降到180亿美金，UST发行量从28.8亿增加到71.7亿美金（增发了42.9亿美元），这使得UST的账面市值跟LUNA的实际市值的比例大大增加，而且获得这40亿美金的这个过程非但没有造成大量卖出LUNA的砸盘效应，还因为LUNA数量的减少价格继续稳步拉升。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xvAq-NE80xt6fa-Ur_iGf.png?height=274&width=720)\n\n利益团体们想变现了，UST就增发了40亿，**这是一个正常的产出么？**\n\n突然就产出这么多，它还能锚定1美金？或者你认为它只是看起来还像1美金\\~\n\nDo kwon们也知道它只是看起来像1美金，所以赶紧换成Crypto世界里的硬通货BTC，而这些看起来像1美金的UST就转嫁给了那些没整懂的韭菜。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9j6HE6NxHe_rNFxvUo97d.jpg?height=344&width=720)\n\n那如果这个时候有人砸盘UST会发生什么？\n\nUST看起来也会远远不值1美金，但没关系，1个UST还可以换价值1美金的LUNA，如果有40亿UST出逃，那么市场上就会多出价值40亿的LUNA，**这是一个正常的产出么？**\n\nDo kwon不知道这些问题？\n\n这个后面再聊......\n\n**（3）死亡螺旋**\n\n通过前面的分析我们可以看到，LUNA不能跌！这里说的不能跌是指LUNA的实际市值不能低于UST的账面市值，否则就会引起“挤兑”：\n\n* 能在中心化交易所跑掉的UST会迅速卖出\n* 跑不掉的时候，UST价格会远低于1美金\n* 当然少不了专业机构的做空和砸盘\n* 链上的UST可以通过Terra平台铸造LUNA，众多的LUNA备铸造出来会产生巨大的抛压，从而导致LUNA价格进一步暴跌\n* 暴跌的LUNA导致其实际市值跟UST账面市值比例进一步下跌\n* 不会套利的韭菜只能卖出UST（我相信绝大多数持有者都是不会操作的）\n* 巨大的套利机会已无法停止，市场上UST价格越低，套利空间就越大，市场上被铸造出来的LUNA就越多，抛压越大价格就会砸得更低\n* 只要市场上还有UST，这个过程就会继续，直到LUNA和UST一起归零\n\n这就是Terra的死亡螺旋，网上有很多文章也分析过！有一些现在看来水平真的还可以，只可惜当时没认真研究。\n\n本文提到的LUNA实际市值是跟虚市值相对的，虚市值就是说LUNA看起来200亿的市值，要真出手是不可能卖不出200亿的，可能只有30亿美金，这个江卓尔有详细解释。\n\n这么说来LUNA-UST的死亡螺旋老早就触发了，而不是网上很多文章说的LUNA的市值降到UST的市值的临界点，大概率是那次增发40亿之后，只是市场反应滞后了。\n\n回过头来看Terra的稳定币机制，真能保证稳定吗？\n\n***它只是在试图保持稳定！***\n\n### Anchor & UST\n\nTerra生态的雏形有了，有了公链原生治理代币LUNA，也有了稳定币UST，接下来就是将生态盘活，让自己整出来的稳定币有更多更扎实的应用场景，让更多的人对UST有需求。\n\n在Defi的世界里除了交易，最重要的就是借贷，于是Anchor出场了。\n\nAnchor跟其它Defi存贷款业务如Compound、Aave、Curve没什么本质区别，几乎没有任何创新，但唯一吸引人的就是它提供了极高的稳定存款收益：**年化20%**，这对于传统金融行业的Old money那是简直不可想象的。\n\n![当时我也存了不到3000美金进去](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l8DzpjS0qxLv4fpVbP8Kh.jpg?height=407&width=720)\n\n有的人会说Defi很多项目收益都吊打20%，但那是LP Farming，收益极不稳定，用户不但要冒币价大幅波动的风险还要承担无偿损失，而Anchor的20%不一样，这是单币质押的收益，如果1UST还相当于1美金的话，这可是Defi无风险最高收益率，其它能接近20%的Defi项目也只是运营一段时间而已，比如Solana生态的solend。\n\n敢给如此高的收益，钱从哪里来？\n\n1. **贷款**\n\n   只要抵押LUNA或ETH，就能以12%的利率（这是浮动的）在Anchor借到UST。\n2. **Anchor代币补贴**\n\n   12%是显然贷不出去的，而且行情不好的时候贷款的需求是远远不如存款的，为了激励用户Anchor发行了代币ANC来做贷款补贴，结果贷款用户经常可以以负利率借到UST。\n\n   这就鼓励了那些空手套白狼的，在Anchor平台贷出来再存进去，赚钱就是这么容易。\n3. **基金会补贴**\n\n   ANC这种项目代币在没有完全被市场验证之前，可以说就是空气币，币价一跌就需要增大补贴力度，不值钱的东西数量越多抛压越大，ANC从刚发行时新高7.4美金直接跌到崩盘钱的1.x美金。\n\n   怎么办？Luna基金会提供补贴。\n\nAnchor的这套机制，有没有问题？\n\n当然有！\n\n这种天上掉馅饼的事情是不可持续的，靠补贴维持的Anchor项目在LUNA崩盘前每天要亏损400万美金，虽然这也是一个大的问题，但对于项目方来说还是可以hold的，40亿美金的辗转腾挪都可以毫无波澜地操作，再补贴个几年都是没有问题的！\n\n***那最大的问题在哪里？***\n\n在于Anchor提供的高存款利率创造了大量的UST需求，导致市场增发了大量的UST，在Anchor的助攻下UST的市值超过DAI和BUSD来到稳定币第3的位置，崩盘前市值已经是180亿。从诞生到崩盘前的1年半时间里，UST从大概2000w增发到180多亿，供应量膨胀了900倍，老大哥USDT达到这个规模花了5-6年。\n\n这么多的UST是燃烧LUNA铸造的，UST的账面市值跟LUNA的虚市值被快速拉到一个一碰就倒的危险占比，此时的LUNA虚市值才200亿，可以说LUNA的归零倒计时就是Anchor开启的，机构的做空只是让它爆发了。\n\n以后再有如此高的收益，都该想想钱是从哪里来的！\n\n### 墨菲定律\n\n卡尔加里大学（University of Calgary）发表过一篇研究论文，论述算法稳定币本质上是容易被摧毁的......实则根本不稳定，是以永久的脆弱性状态存在。\n\n美联储对稳定币市场的研究表明，设计缺陷可能会导致挂钩失效。\n\n如果事情有变坏的可能，不管这种可能性有多小，它总会发生！\n\n这就是墨菲定律。\n\nTerra稳定币互燃机制的漏洞也一定会触发，LUNA的崩盘也是必然的，Citadel、BlackRock早就开好了空单等着定点狙击，华尔街将借到的3-4b的btc在市场砸盘造成恐慌，很多的名人和资本开始从anchor出逃，LUNA、UST的币价也开始随大盘下跌，而这个过程中terra的金主jump还在砸ETH接盘，但砸下去的ETH又进一步加剧了市场恐慌，进一步催化了大户出逃。\n\n前面讲到的死亡螺旋已经加速了。\n\n如果LUNA-UST的互燃机制不停，LUNA就必定归零，UST也必将随着LUNA的归零而归零。最悲剧的就是那些看着LUNA价格低而接盘的韭菜！\n\n### 贵 & 便宜、抄底 & 做空\n\n韭菜为什么会去接盘？\n\n回答这个问题之前我们先来探讨一个问题，这是我做游戏的那几年深刻写入本能的逻辑：什么是贵，什么是便宜？什么情况下成立？\n\n前面一篇文章《[左侧交易&右侧交易](https://mirror.xyz/imsongoku.eth/xMC4tbFcaR5XYxzwIa1rvTidPe0_63sPUmp5y6-PaZQ)》也讲过贵与便宜的问题，这里我们再来加强一下。\n\n***15000美金贵吗？***\n\n如果能买一辆Tesla就显得很便宜，只能一辆自行车就死贵！相对现在的BTC来说你会觉得便宜，相对312的价格来说又会觉得挺贵。\n\n***0.1美金便宜吗？***\n\n如果能买1个USDT你觉得很便宜，如果这是shib的价格你一下子就会觉得好贵！如果有一天shib因为某种原因涨到了1美金，回过头来看你又会觉得0.1美金都好便宜！\n\n便宜是个相对概念，看跟谁比！\n\n绝大多数在LUNA跌去80%、90%、99%、99.9%接盘的韭菜都是在跟一个月前的LUNA价格比，相比110多的LUNA来说20的LUNA绝对叫便宜。\n\n什么？还能跌到5块…还能见到1块的LUNA！\n\n这么便宜了，还不抄底？\n\n相对于110多的LUNA，5块、1块的价格确是很低，但不能说它就是便宜，在项目基本面没有问题的时候姑且可以叫便宜，但在机制有问题已经触发崩盘的时候就只能说它**单价低**。\n\n一个市值TOP10的生态凭什么跌到这么低？庄家可怜你？Do kwon给你机会抄底？\n\n显然不是！\n\n只要互燃机制还没停，无论价格有多少个0都会继续跌，那些看单价低抄底的真金白银，都是在解救金字塔顶等着出逃的UST大户而已，还有满仓加杠杆去赌的，他们天真地认为LUNA这种TOP10的项目在砸掉90%，99%，99.9%后就会止跌。\n\n{\n\n// 这几组数据是参考江卓尔的：\n\nLUNA从57美元跌到4.1美元，总市值缩水90%，仅仅逃出23.8亿美金UST。\n\n下面这些就要感谢那些看LUNA单价低而觉得它便宜的韭菜了：\n\n57\\~4.1美金接盘的资金，解救了23.8亿美金UST\n\n4\\.1\\~1美金抄底的资金，解救了29.2亿美金UST\n\n1\\~0.1美金抄底的资金，解救了16.8亿美金UST\n\n< 0.1美金抄底的资金，解救了4.2亿美金UST\n\n以上抄底慈善金共解救了74亿美金UST，最终剩下了113亿美元的UST也将归零\n\n}\n\n身边的朋友、同事有0.8买入UST的，有20多的时候开合约做多LUNA的，还有0.5x美金梭哈抄底的，也有从1元反弹到7元那波5块钱全仓干进去的。\n\n**所有这些抄底的都没有搞懂它机制是怎么运转的！**\n\n但Do Kwon 会不知道？\n\n显然不是！\n\n我只敢相信这是他们为了让那些合作伙伴、投资机构、金主大户的UST能跑掉而有意为之的（UST、LUNA总要救一个，LUNA大不了再发个项目空投给那些利益共同体），牺牲品就是广大觉得它便宜梭哈进去抄底的韭菜，LUNA的单价越低就越能吸引到更多觉得它便宜的资金。\n\n三箭会亏？ 我是不信的\n\n***那能不能做空呢？***\n\n一个朋友这样跟我说：随便开个空都赚翻了。\n\n这句话放在任何市场都是不成立的。\n\nLUNA这波崩盘从0.688\\~7.88那波，反拉了11倍，爆了无数的空单。做空是极难的，做多最多跌99.99...%，做空可以拉100倍！特别是那些开高倍杠杆的最终都是爆仓。\n\n正在写这篇文章的时候，一个朋友发给我一个网上的截图：Axie的SLP也要归零了，0.004美金四舍五入之后就是0.00美金了。What？我不知道Lars Doucet和这位鬼先生有没有学过小学数学，刚才看了一下SLP又涨到0.006了，四舍五入之后又活过来了？而且照他们这个逻辑shib、SOS岂不早就应该归零了。\n\n这就是典型的看单价说事的，AXS、SLP也可能会归零，如果它设计的游戏经济系统有问题，但绝对不是这种哗众取宠的KOL写的逻辑！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HvDT_BJF2q9p3JMoky7aw.png?height=505&width=720)\n\n### 机制、机会 & 什么时候才能抄底？\n\n那有没有机会抄底？\n\n当然有！\n\n什么时候能抄底呢？\n\n***漏洞被封住的时候！***\n\n我们常常挂在嘴边的一句话：危机危机危中有机！\n\n领导的UST跑得差不多之后，UST-LUNA互燃机制被关闭的时候就是抄底点，市场上不会再有更多的LUNA增发出来了，套利者也无利可图了，市场上不会有新的LUNA抛压了，而那些看着它都5个0的韭菜们觉得它更便宜了。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uzLHFHvxUW2Aib6Rx-h-_.jpg?height=306&width=720)\n\n我就是在这个最低点抄到底而赚了几十倍的，但这次完全是靠运气，所以只抄了几十美金。我只投机了币安900w的LUNA最大购买量和10美金的最小下单量的卡点而已，当时的心态是就当留作纪念了。\n\n少数看懂Terra协议机制的大牛应该都赚翻了。\n\n### 抄底后卖点在哪里？\n\nLUNA至此已经不可能再回到一个月前了，UST的稳定币也注定要归零了，经历过这种载入史册的悲剧谁还会对这个团队有信心？抄底的LUNA最终也有可能一文不值，拿着总归是没什么价值的。\n\n***那应该什么时候卖？***\n\n涨10倍？20倍？\n\n其实聪明的韭菜已经注意到各种交易所的价差了，只是当时各个交易所之间限制了充提。\n\n先略过币安下架的过程 ......\n\n币安上架并开启充提后，和OK、Gate的价差是巨大的，币安的价格相对他们太便宜了，这个时候就是币安的买点、OK、Gate的卖点。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kAjZ5J7lOE8NpZGrUJw5Y.jpg?height=402&width=720)\n\n如果是5个0在币安抄底的根本就不用出，即便无法搬到OK卖也要先拿着。\n\n直到交易所之间价格套平，就是卖点。虽然市场情绪会让它再继续拉一波，但到这里就可以准备卖了。我是币安下架前卖的，如果能等到交易所之间套利这波，能赚200倍。\n\n下次不能靠运气，\\~\n\n### 结束\n\n从Terra的白皮书中我们得知，创始人是为了实现比特币的最初的目标：点对点电子货币系统，为了实现这一目标Terra创建了UST-LUNA互燃机制的算法稳定币系统......\n\n不管Do Kwon的目标是什么，结果都是悲剧。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A95ieATORsqJxdEv7tYzP.jpg?height=334&width=720)\n\n我们学到了什么？\n\n* 没有外部价值资产抵押的算稳是行不通的\n* 少听网上的KOL们BB，现在翻出之前Youtube各种Terra的BB视频，脸都要气肿，通常他们自己都没搞懂\n* 不要迷信那些头部项目、投资机构，通常他们对Crypto的认知还不如你身边的技术\n* 如果有能力直接看代码，看不懂认真研究白皮书\n* 任何机制都是有漏洞的\n* Crypto行业才刚开始起飞，这种机会还很多\n*

Mention what to do next? A key word repeatedly mentioned by many cloud manufacturers is: ecology. The sales model of cloud manufacturers is changing from traditional resellers selling products to independent software developers serving to attract more customers to the cloud.\n\nAuthor / author of Caijing Tianxia weekly Xue Yongwei\n\nYour video conference is not so stuck, explosive news is difficult to make the server crash, and hundreds of millions of people will not go down together. There is the most direct reason behind this - the cloud computing technology has become more mature in the past two years.\n\nOnly with the technical support of cloud manufacturers, enterprises can freely use computing power like water and electricity, and carry out large-scale data storage and data computing, can the era of cloud really come.\n\nAccording to the forecast data of IDC, a market research company, in just 15 years, the overall market scale of global cloud computing has increased from zero to US $705 billion in 2021. This is an amazing data, but this is only the first scene of the cloud computing market.\n\nIt is predicted that by 2025, the overall global cloud computing market will exceed US $1.3 trillion, and the cloud computing market will open the second act of innovative development. The huge market space makes it impossible for Internet giants with peak growth in consumer Internet fields such as e-commerce and entertainment to ignore. Cloud business, without exception, undertakes the new growth curve of Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and Huawei.\n\nBut behind these beautiful visions, the real competition has been extremely cruel.\n\nThe input cost remained high, and the growth rate of income began to decline significantly. In the most critical government and enterprise market, several big companies are in deep water. As the cloud market enters a new cycle, major manufacturers have reached a new consensus. It is no longer necessary to burn money. In the face of real income problems, they are bound to come up with feasible solutions.\n\nThe hard battle is coming. From strategy to personnel organization, it is inevitable to face a new round of shock.\n\nExecutive shock\n\nAt the end of the first quarter, the executives in the cloud business sector of several major domestic factories changed very frequently.\n\nIn March, Cai Yinghua, who once served as president of China’s government and enterprise business, parachuted to Alibaba as senior vice president and served as president of global sales of Alibaba cloud, with a level as high as M7. Ren Geng (M6), President of Alibaba cloud China, is also a former Huawei employee.\n\nBut after that, rumors of Ren Geng’s resignation began to flow around. An employee of Alibaba cloud told Caijing Tianxia weekly that there was news in the industry that Ren Geng might join Baidu cloud.\n\nOn the evening of May 11, according to leifeng.com, citing various sources, Ren Geng communicated with members of Ali’s general office during his leave after resignation, and finally decided to stay in Ali. As for the specific position, it is not known for the time being.\n\nDuring this period, on May 5, the news that Shen Shuan officially led Baidu cloud spread everywhere. Although insiders say that this is just a normal job rotation, it is also very obvious that Shen Shuan, who once led the business adjustment of MEG (Baidu mobile ecological business group), is taking over - as the fourth cloud, baidu cloud is also ready to do a big job this year.\n\nIn the internal letter released by Robin Lee, he placed high hopes on the future of Baidu cloud: “Shen Shuan will be responsible for leading the ACG (Baidu AI Cloud business group) team to accelerate the implementation of the cloud intelligence integration strategy, achieve quantitative to qualitative changes in scale and health, and make new contributions to the development of Baidu’s second curve.”\n\nIn the past 2021, the management of Huawei cloud has also experienced four adjustments to strengthen the attack and grab. At Huawei’s 2021 performance conference, Huawei cloud also became a new star in the platform with dense executives. Meng Wanzhou, who made his debut after returning home, shared the beautiful revenue data of Huawei cloud.\n\nHuawei cloud insider Huang Qi (a pseudonym) observed that “Huawei has only started to build the cloud since 2017. In just a few years, it has changed from ‘others’ to the number two in China. Alibaba cloud is in a hurry to dig people in the past, which can be seen as urgent”. The change behind the scenes is that Alibaba cloud lost many orders in 2021, and tiktok, a major customer in the global market, moved out of Alibaba cloud. In December of that year, Alibaba cloud was also announced by the Ministry of industry and information technology to suspend the qualification of cooperative units for six months.\n\nUnder various circumstances, Alibaba cloud’s market share fell rapidly. In the fourth quarter of 2021, Alibaba cloud experienced a stall trend for the first time after several quarters of high growth. Its business revenue was 19.539 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 20%, the lowest in history. According to canalys data, Alibaba cloud’s domestic cloud computing market share has changed from 46.4% in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 37% in 2021.\n\nThe market share of Huawei cloud has reached 18%, with an annual growth of 67%. Followed by Tencent cloud and Baidu cloud, although the market accounts for only 16%. One is only 9%, but the growth rate is more than 50%.\n\nAlthough the market share fluctuates, the growth rate of cloud manufacturers generally slows down in 2022.\n\nIt is publicly reported that the performance data of a number of domestic and foreign cloud manufacturers in 2021 show that the high growth stage of 50% - 60% of domestic cloud manufacturers has ended, and the growth rate of 20% - 30% is the current general growth rate. In addition to Amazon’s AWS revenue growth of nearly 40%, the revenue growth of mature digital enterprises such as Microsoft cloud, salesforce and Accenture remained between 20% - 30% in 2021. The growth rate of old IT enterprises such as SAP and Oracle is 10%.\n\nWithout exception, enterprises have formed a new consensus, and cloud business has to carry the banner of making money and enter the stage of high-quality development.\n\nIn 2021, the revenue of Alibaba cloud, Huawei cloud and Baidu AI Cloud will be 72.4 billion yuan, 20.1 billion yuan and 15.1 billion yuan respectively, which is still a big gap compared with the main business revenue of their respective companies.\n\nIn the past, the cloud market paid special attention to the effect of scale. Only the larger the scale, can we dilute the cost and obtain higher profits. At this point, overseas cloud manufacturers have found a feasible way.\n\n“Amazon cloud service (AWS) has made a demonstration.” Hu Jianfeng, chairman of Aoyuan electronics, told Caijing world weekly. In the first quarter of 2022, the net profit of Amazon cloud business increased by nearly 57% year-on-year to US $6.52 billion, filling the first place of Amazon", "timestamp": 1653266446, "digest": "l3UzUT8cX73yipBkfF5D8c9Q-2lUfipNnN74HQ02yGU", "contributor": "0xb8aEf0108Eebaed8d7C5Bb5c171DEb65911D95Da"}

There is a white lily elevator ootd in front and Deng Jiajia’s RV ootd after work.\n\n▲ picture source: xiaohongshu @ Deng Jiajia\n\nI have to say that the trend vision of “little aunt” is still very accurate. Chanel 22 was started by her shortly after it was launched. With the off shoulder sweater, it is full of rebellious and neutral temperament.\n\nSimplicity without obvious logo is the highlight of Deng Jiajia’s dressing. Classic and timeless big brand items are her first choice. Relying on the basic items and her strong folding skills, she wears one satisfactory look after another.\n\nIn her private clothes, there is not only the atmosphere of mature women, but also the sense of playfulness of girls. Each set can be used as our early spring wear formula.\n\nThe spring breeze is blowing and the weather is getting warmer and warmer. It’s better to wear fashionable clothes with “little aunt” with vitality!\n\nFrom the colorless autumn and winter to the bright spring and summer, Deng Jiajia crowned his spring and summer look with gorgeous colors.\n\nColorful striped sweaters, tight jeans, long straight hair, gentle and playful, cowboy fisherman hat, add a bit of cool feeling, and my sister is too good!\n\nAs a classic element, the stripe seems to have never quit the fashion circle in the impression of coco. With the advent of spring, the contrast stripe sweater with both fashion and warmth covers all kinds of shapes of fashionable icon.\n\nThe bright striped style adds a little more fun than the ordinary knitted style, especially after adding the color contrast design, it magically presents the mature femininity and childlike and girlish feeling at the same time.\n\nThe styles of fine stripes and thick stripes are different, and the atmosphere created is also very different:\n\nThe dense layers of fine stripes are full of delicacy and have a strong visual contraction effect. Especially with the sweet beauty department, it is just like a young girl.\n\nOn the contrary, thick stripes are more in line with cool girls. When the stripes are further thickened and widened, close to the “color matching sweater” and matched with the color contrast design, the visual effect of jumping can’t be more fashionable.\n\nFor color control, “little aunt” really has her own set. In fact, the harmony of color matching in a whole set of outfit is the more important and difficult knowledge to master. Let’s “start” from her and steal some tricks.\n\nOf course, the simplest is to match with the color. The colors of hats and shoes echo and are harmonious.\n\nThe red sweater skirt reveals the slim leg lines, and the canvas shoes are matched in color to unify the overall visual effect. Deng Jiajia will also focus on accessories. She uses a small sweater with red elements to decorate the overall look.\n\nBack to the street shooting field, many fashionable icons will also use sweaters + suits to decorate their out of street look. They tie their sweaters at will and hang them on their bodies, which not only looks like a cloak, but also increases the sense of modeling hierarchy, killing two birds with one stone; You can also tie the sweater obliquely on your body to keep warm, and your personality is also 100 points.\n\nPlayers with a higher segment can play sweaters freely, with great space to play.\n\nIn addition to matching the color system, “little aunt” is the master who can grasp the sense of atmosphere. The short blouse and ankle length pants are very casual and fashionable in French style.\n\nThe round neck is matched with the H version above the sleeves and hips, which clearly highlights its own temperament. It is like a basic style and is compatible with everything. Then integrate the golden buttons into it, showing the taste of Paris girls who traveled in the 1970s.\n\nMany people worry that the round neck is easy to show a short neck. In fact, they can work hard from the inside. T-shirts with lower necklines and shirts with slightly unbuttoned two buttons are good ways to crack.\n\nThe small lapel of a suit always gives people a strong feeling, but choose the style with lace decoration to let a feminine flavor between maturity and liveliness come to your face. It’s good to show the leg lines at will!\n\nIf you want to dress more casually? May wish to refer to the “little aunt” and hip length version of the jacket. Such a large version shows a strong neutral atmosphere and full marks for personality.\n\nDeng Jiajia’s street sense is nothing more than a trace of sweet girl’s convergence attitude. For example, when wearing a sweater, we should choose this style with lovely printing.\n\nThe super large animation print is frank and lovely, while the smaller pattern will show the overall exquisite feeling up, and the next pair of jeans is not heavy at all.\n\nCardigans and sweaters are also good items for street sweet girls. The furry cardigan and sweater of “little aunt” make the whole person shine from the inside to the outside, and the more important factor of keeping warm is doubled.\n\nThe playing method of matching with skirt has been tried repeatedly. The slim skirt shows a light and familiar charm, and the pleated skirt brings a playful ghost horse experience; The long skirt is a model of literature and art. Whoever wears it is beautiful!\n\nOf course, it’s best to use CP with jeans group. Frankness and tenderness easily collide with sweet and cool temperament. Take it easy!\n\nOn the screen, Deng Jiajia created a multifaceted life, but off the screen, she just wanted to live a romantic life. She said: “my life is simple and beautiful. If you don’t like it, you can bypass it, but please don’t disturb…”\n\nShe likes to watch movies at home and study acting skills. She also likes to practice dancing and fitness with her friends. She knows what she wants and enriches herself before proving herself to the world again and again.\n\nIn her spare time, she makes an appointment with two or three friends to travel, because “travel can understand everyone’s views on life and emotion in your different cultural backgrounds,” which helps her create more different characters in the future.\n\nShe has few business hours on weekdays. It is Deng Jiajia’s principle to precipitate herself, enrich herself and endure loneliness.\n\nNow, the ootd class of “little aunt” has started, which also allows us to see more possibilities of her off screen.\n\nMay we live an interesting life and wear good clothes like her.", "timestamp": 1653266730, "digest": "MIXms0_-PEjIiVOZr19y3B_pvnyWd3A-kY4wX-8m4u8", "contributor": "0x64eC7A1Db8B98Ae8d155746288636Db91fe99edf"}

Compared with the 20 people at that time, the 24 person list of the Chinese team added four players, including Du Qingqing, Zhong Hui, Wang Wenhan and Wang Mengjie.\n\nAmong them, Wang Wenhan is the youngest and a young general born in 2002. Wang Mengjie is a free man of the Chinese women’s volleyball team at the Tokyo Olympic Games. This time, she has also been recruited by Cai bin again.\n\nAfter Wang Wenhan joined the list, the “Post-00” players in the 24 member list of the Chinese women’s volleyball team reached 7, accounting for 30% of the whole list. Cai Bin’s idea of training new players can be seen.\n\nPreviously, Cai Bin said that it will be his important task to explore new players, but at the same time, he will also pay attention to bringing the new with the old: “we choose those with more development potential among the young players and those with practical experience and promotion space among the Mesozoic players. At the same time, we also need relatively older players to pass, help and lead.”\n\nThe 2022 World Women’s Volleyball League will start in early June Beijing time. According to relevant rules, 24 players in the big list are eligible to participate. Each team needs to determine the final list of 14 players to participate in the current race before each race.

Compared with the profit of 1.9 trillion yen a year ago, Softbank has undergone a dramatic change.\n\nSoftbank took some of the biggest bets through its $100 billion “vision fund” and its $51 billion “vision fund phase 2” in the fourth quarter, mainly because rising interest rates and political uncertainty forced some capital out of the market.\n\nIn the fourth fiscal quarter (January to March 2022), some technology stocks invested by Softbank fell sharply. For example, the shares of coupang, a South Korean e-commerce company, fell 40%, grab, a Singapore online car Hailing service giant, fell 51%, and paytm, an Indian digital payment startup, fell 60%.\n\nMany stocks invested by Softbank continued to fall in April and may this year. With the decline in the valuation of technology companies, Softbank’s investment scale is also shrinking. In late April, Softbank led a new round of financing for AI medical service, a Japanese biotechnology start-up, but the investment was only US $70 million.\n\nOf course, the investment losses of the two “vision funds” were partially offset by the profits of their Japanese mobile subsidiaries Softbank Corp and British chip design company arm. Son Zhengyi, chairman and CEO of Softbank group, has said that it plans to list arm in this fiscal year (up to March 2023).\n\nThroughout fiscal year 2021, Softbank’s net loss reached 1.7 trillion yen, also a record low. In contrast, Softbank made a record profit of 5 trillion yen in fiscal year 2020.\n\nToday, Softbank’s share price fell 8% before the results were released.", "timestamp": 1653265190, "digest": "0CrbNLnLSwGEVoxKnw2SD_q1YRR9ZmEP7MMG5YhuEcU", "contributor": "0x3e6b57543d35b1bB96611b0F1974a7Af4DC3c308"}

In the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 (the first quarter of 2022) as of April 2, Disney’s total revenue was US $19.249 billion, a year-on-year increase of 23%, slightly lower than the market expectation of US $20.04 billion; The operating profit was US $3.699 billion, a year-on-year increase of 50%; The net profit attributable to the parent company was US $470 million, a year-on-year decrease of 48%; The adjusted earnings per share was $1.08, slightly lower than the market expected $1.19. Only in terms of intuitive data, the revenue and earnings per share in the first quarter were lower than market expectations, and the growth rate also slowed down compared with the previous quarter. However, it is worth mentioning that the growth of Disney’s streaming media paying users far exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, which is in obvious contrast to Naifei’s loss of paying users for the first time in more than a decade this quarter. According to the financial report, Disney + global paid subscribers increased by 7.9 million to 137.7 million in this quarter, higher than the growth of 3.5 million expected by analysts; Including ESPN + and Hulu, the total number of subscribers of Disney streaming media platform exceeded 205 million, which nearly shook the hegemony of Netflix (221.6 million). After the rebirth and warm-up of the previous quarter, Disney is constantly showing the structural advantages of its century old entertainment giant and its ability to “tell stories” to the outside world this quarter. Theme parks have doubled. Disney’s business structure mainly includes four parts: wired network, direct to consumers (Disney +, Hulu, ESPN +), content sales authorization business and theme park revenue. Specifically, in this quarter, Disney’s cable network revenue was US $7.116 billion, an increase of 5% year-on-year, which was mainly due to the growth of advertising revenue brought by Oscar broadcasting; The revenue from content sales (original film and television entertainment) decreased by 3% year-on-year; Streaming media revenue was $4.903 billion, a year-on-year increase of 23%, mainly due to the increase in the number of paid subscriptions. Theme parks, experience and derivatives continued to double their growth, with an operating revenue of US $6.652 billion; Operating profit was close to $1.8 billion, compared with a loss of $400 million in the same period last year. The revenue growth of this part is driven by the increase of passenger flow and commodity sales of IP in the park. “Star Wars” fully released the ability of IP to absorb gold in this quarter and brushed the sense of existence. On March 1, the Star Wars themed hotel, which took six years to build in the Disney park in Orlando, opened. As the world’s first immersive Hotel, it attracted many Star Wars fans to punch in as soon as it opened. Even the price of $4809 (about 30000 yuan) for two nights did not dissuade fans from their enthusiasm. All rooms were fully booked before July. Besides theme hotels, Disney is also constantly exploring new business forms and growth points. Since this year, Disney has made frequent moves in the field of real estate. First, it announced the launch of the residential community storyivingby Disney (living in fairy tales) in cochella Valley, California, and then said it would set aside nearly 80 acres (about 320000 square meters) in Orange County, Florida, for the construction of 1300 affordable houses. The former faces Disney fans and integrates the soul of fairy tales into houses; The latter highlights the entertainment giant’s sense of social responsibility and alleviates the shortage of affordable housing in Orlando. Whether the former or the latter, Disney, which goes deep into the real estate field, seems to have the same goal as the domestic cultural tourism real estate developers entering the theme park. However, domestic real estate developers have the advantage of capital, but lack the ability to tell stories. Rongchuang China, Evergrande children’s world and Wanda have all been ambitious to enter the theme park, but the effect is not ideal. Disney’s logic is contrary to that of domestic real estate developers. The story is still the underlying logic to promote owners to pay. “Stories are the core of everything we do. We like to bring real stories into life and immerse owners in these stories,” said Michael hendergen, a designer of Disney theme park and now a design engineer designing residential areas. From theme parks, theme hotels to “theme” real estate, Disney continues to give full play to its strong IP operation ability and storytelling ability, endow the cold buildings with soul and let users pay for the added experience value, so that the “coverage” of its entertainment empire becomes wider and wider. Streaming media: Naifei fell and Disney stood up. In terms of streaming media, this quarter can be said to be a “combination of rain and snow”. Naifei lost 200000 paying users worldwide, and the loss will continue. Naifei expects the number of global paying users to decrease by 2 million in the second quarter. But the geomantic omen turns around, and Disney’s streaming media business is growing strongly. Including Hulu, Disney + and ESPN, Disney’s total paid subscribers to streaming media exceeded 205 million, of which Disney + continued to grow by 7.9 million in this quarter, reaching 137.7 million subscribers, following a month on month increase of nearly 12 million in the previous quarter. Tricia Biggio, CEO of invsable universe, an American entertainment technology company, said frankly that Netflix has indeed established the market and Disney is indeed a latecomer, but now it is a winner. When an industry increasingly relies on content and IP and consumers are more and more picky, Disney obviously has the upper hand. In the face of the global environment where the growth dividend of streaming media users has peaked, Disney’s growth space and growth pressure coexist. In a conference call after the earnings announcement on Wednesday, Disney CEO Bob chapek reiterated his goal that Disney + subscribers will reach 230 million to 260 million in September 2024, which means that Disney + needs to maintain a growth of 9.1 million subscribers every quarter in the next two years in order to reach the lowest value of the goal. Content ammunition is the key to the new promotion of disnila. At the end of March, Marvel’s new hero “Moonlight Knight” landed on Disney + platform, and the star wars episode “Obi Wan” will also premiere on Disney +", "timestamp": 1653266931, "digest": "3BhBtu1i3RxHujJH8R7nK1HxUvxkzI9QV1oTUJsfFMo", "contributor": "0x8E38F710179cCFfa1a94983FC8DBe0fb6fb86ecA"}

URLを確認する\n3. 疑わしいと思ったら焦りに負けず、チャットで正しいかを確認する(できない場合はscamの可能性高い)\n4. サイトのmint数、送り先コントラクトを確認し、その数に不都合がないかを確認する\n\n## DMは詐欺！！！！DMは詐欺！！！！DMは詐欺！！！\n\n### 1対1の取引をしない\n\nまず、DMで相手とやり取りすること自体リスクがあります。誰もが見えるパブリックな場所で交渉しましょう。交渉するにしても相手のリンクを踏まないようにしましょう。\n\nscamの数としては私見では Telegram > Discord > Twitterです。まずDMは詐欺前提であることを忘れず心置きなくブロックもしましょう。\n\nDMに関係するscamには思いついた限りでいくつかのscamがあります。\n\n1. 偽mintサイトへ誘導\n2. あなたのNFTがほしいからと交渉する\n3. クリエイター向けに詳細をpdfなど別途ファイルで添付する\n4. MODになってほしいからと偽discordリンクに招待、その後verifyのためと謳ったscamサイトに誘導し、Discordのトークンを抜き取りアカウントを奪われます。\n5. トラブルに会った場合、サポートするという内容のscamがTwitter、Discord、Telegramに大量に来ますが、1対1のサポートはまずscamです。\n\n## 偽リンクを踏まない\n\n### 広告における偽物\n\nGoogle Search、Twitterの広告には偽プロジェクトを謳い、あなたの資産を奪おうとしてきます。そういう場合は、公式Twitter、公式Discord、coingecko、Defillamaなど信頼の置けるサイトから飛ぶようにします。\n\n公式Twitterはフォロワーの数、共通でフォローしてる人の数から判断してください。フォロー数にもよりますが、0\\~10人程度なら怪しくて、たとえ数万人居たとしてもフォロワーを購入しています。\n\n### Twitter\n\n偽のサポート、公式マークが付いている、フォロワーが多い。どれも全部関係ないです。共通フォローが多いかを確認しましょう。\n\n公式を装った詐欺への誘導もよくあります。紛らわしいので非フォロワー、非フォローからの通知をoffにしましょう。\n\n### 偽のDiscordリンク\n\n![doodles公式](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z54azGgPUHad9zG1kYIen.png?height=383&width=759)\n\n例えば、DoodlesのDiscordリンクはdiscord.gg/doodlesです。これはサーバーブースターというDiscordの機能によってレベル3を達成すると招待コードを好きな文字列に変更できます。\n\n例えば、僕が大きなNFTプロジェクト(akashi)を持っていて、50人だけ招待したいとします。通常discordの招待はランダムな文字列になり、abcdefgというコードを50人の制限をかけてTwitterで配布します。51人目以降はそのdiscordには招待コードが切れましたというメッセージが表示されます。\n\nここにscamを狙っているAさんがいるとします。僕のabcdefgというコードが切れた後だと、ブーストしているレベル3のdiscordサーバーはabcdefgという招待コードを作成できます。それを狙って、abcdefgというコードで偽akashiサーバーに誘導します。そこで偽サイトから(以下略)\n\n### Telegram\n\n自分が被害にあったのはこれです。公式を名乗った偽のtelegramがたくさんあります。\n\nさあ名前だけを見てどれが公式かわかりますか？僕にはわかりませんが、選択されているのと、Announcements以外は偽のセールが行われていました。\n\nTelegramはもうscamの温床になってるので、自分は殆ど使っていません。偽公式に簡単に辿れるのでかなり注意が必要です。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JO7HU5KI1MJ0zMNCGPrpC.png?height=379&width=567)\n\n### Instagram\n\nInstagramには公式以外にもたくさんの偽物アカウントが存在し、Twitterと違って、数万人フォロワーがいることが多いです。中には偽物のほうがフォロワー数が多いケースも有るため、気をつけなければなりません。\n\nInstagramが一番怖いです。\n\n### Openseaの偽コレクション\n\n1. 公式マークは関係ない\n2. 公式Discord、Twitterに記載されているofficial linkからOpenseaに飛ぶ\n3. コントラクトアドレスでOpenseaの検索をする\n4. 安い価格に飛びつかず、出来高を確認し、10ETH以下なら偽のコレクションと判断する(そもそも流動性のないプロジェクトに飛びつかないよう)\n\n最近Phantom Network(PxN)という大きなプロジェクトのmintが開始されました。もちろんそれを狙って、偽コレクションも始動します。\n\n0x160c404b2b49cbc3240055ceaee026df1e8497a0はPxNのコントラクトで事前に公開されていました。以下画像2枚目にある通り既に**偽のコレクション**は消されていますが、偽のコレクションで100ETH以上の取引がありました。\n\n[https://twitter.com/dingalingts/status/1522055650028978176](https://twitter.com/dingalingts/status/1522055650028978176)\n\nなお既に犯人は特定されています。\n\n[https://twitter.com/Serpent/status/1522059672886251521](https://twitter.com/Serpent/status/1522059672886251521)\n\n## 偽サイトにアクセスした場合\n\nウォレット接続はただRead権限を与えるだけのはずなので問題ないです。署名(signature)、トランザクション、approveを行うと、そのウォレットを危険に晒すことになります。仮に行った場合は、revokeする、そのウォレットからすべての資産を移動するなどして二度と使わないなどの対応を取り、資産を守ります。\n\nrevoke先\n\n[https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker](https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker)\n\nappriveの仕組み\n\n[https://youtu.be/N05FR_e7124?t=949](https://youtu.be/N05FR_e7124?t=949)\n\n### Metamaskを捨ててRabbyを利用する\n\nセキュリティ対策がたくさん盛り込まれています。これだけで9割は防げるはずです。\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/yakisobaminister.eth/nKCSnpvrobSShtdESJArIUwOIXYUR4exyu1O4Opkooc](https://mirror.xyz/yakisobaminister.eth/nKCSnpvrobSShtdESJArIUwOIXYUR4exyu1O4Opkooc)\n\n### 偽のNFT、トークン\n\n例えばですが、以下のようなよく知らないコレクションがhiddenやopenseaそのままに送信されることがあります。それらをhiddenに動かしたり、別のアドレスに送ってしまうとウォレット内資産が取られる危険性があるため、触らずにそのままにしておきましょう。\n\n![偽のコレクション](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KfRFbQOYObr6HXrC3BqXd.png?height=506&width=1114)\n\n![謎エアドロップ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XEBYfUFHfMJ5IWjE1UrSP.png?height=507&width=1229)\n\n![アクセスしたらお金上げる系](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YvPrQ4W_Aeuc-hMYTJQXq.png?height=283&width=1130)\n\n### テストネット\n\nNFTだけやってる人にありがちですが、ETHメインネットとテストネットのトークンを同一視してしまうことがあります。テストネットトークンは誰でも無限に受け取れて、それ自体に価値がないので、rapsten,kovan,rinkbyなどのトークンで取引を成立してはいけません。必ず相手のリンクは踏んだり、トークンの送金、受取をせず、相手にできないと言われてもopensea、looksrare、x2y2など公式のリンクから出品しましょう。(そもそも1v1で相手にしない)\n\n[https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/)\n\n### フィッシングメール\n\nこれがなんだかんだ簡単で引っかかる人が多いです。最近はLedgerのメールアドレスが流出して、フィッシングメールが届くようになったようです。\n\n基本的にWeb3ではメールを使いません。メールが届くのはサービスに登録したものです。Openseaから取引完了のメールが届くでしょうけど、僕はフィッシングと紛らわしいため全部ブロックしています。Web3とは関係ないと思いきや、Appleアカウントのフィッシングから資産を取られたケースもあります。Metamask(メール登録箇所ない)から来ることもありますが、まずありえないので、定期的にメールアドレスの整理を行いましょう。疑わしい場合は誰かに確認を。\n\n### 番外編 偽giveaway\n\n本物に混じって偽giveawayが行われていることがあります。今だと日本ではstepnが多いですが、人気NFTプロジェクトにも例があります。\n\nフォロワーを無料で獲得するためにやっているため、野放しにするといずれ詐欺アカウントに変容し、詐欺に加担することにつながるので、避けましょう。自分は偽giveaway参加者はいつか自分も被害に合うかもしれないと思って全てブロックしてます。", "timestamp": 1653266395, "digest": "7a9z0TakP7y9xHb7kocA8lHDpBu9-1PaaHnqfib2M14", "contributor": "0xAe74399237E02458aa42283e7c3ef2929AD4896C"}

The chief financial officer who has worked for more than ten years said he was unable to perform his duties, refused to sign the annual report and the first quarterly report, and the company called the police", "body": "Stock speculation depends on the Research Report of Jinqilin analyst. It is authoritative, professional, timely and comprehensive to help you tap the potential theme opportunities!\n\nAfter the chief financial officer who has worked in Fucheng for more than ten years left a statement, he lost contact?\n\nAccording to the announcement of Fucheng shares, at about 7 p.m. on April 27, the Secretary of the board of directors of the company found that a paper document signed by “Cheng Jing” was suddenly placed on the table, Main contents of the document: “1. Major shareholders have interfered in the operation and management of the company, and the finance is not independent; 2. They have been unable to perform the duties of the chief financial officer normally, and can not be diligent and responsible, and the authenticity of some businesses can not be determined; 3. They can not guarantee the authenticity, accuracy and completeness of the financial data in the report, and can not bear individual and joint legal liabilities; 4. They refuse to sign and confirm the annual report of 2021 and the report of the first quarter of 2022.” Since then, the CFO lost contact, the company can only review, approve and disclose the company’s periodic reports in the way that the CFO did not sign the 2021 annual report and the first quarter report of 2022 and did not guarantee the authenticity, accuracy and integrity of the company’s 2021 annual report and the first quarter report of 2022.\n\nCheng Jing, chief financial officer of Fucheng Co., Ltd., has worked in the company for more than ten years. According to the public information, Cheng Jing, aged 54, served as the manager of the company’s finance department from 2006 to February 2011. Since March 2011, she has served as the company’s chief financial officer. Her current term of office in the company will expire on May 16, 2022.\n\nOn April 29, the company reported to the public security department. The reason is that the company tried to contact Cheng Jing, but found that she lost contact after leaving documents. The phone was turned off, wechat voice and information did not respond, and there was no response when visiting her home address.\n\nOn the same day, Fucheng shares received the supervision letter from Shanghai Stock Exchange. The main content of the letter involves that Cheng Jing, the company’s chief financial officer, did not sign the company’s financial report for 2021 and the financial statements for the first quarter of 2022, did not sign a written confirmation opinion on the company’s periodic report, and did not express an objection.\n\nOn May 11, Fucheng responded to the regulatory work letter issued by Shanghai Stock Exchange on April 29, 2022, saying that the reason why CFO Cheng Jing did not sign the periodic report was that before reviewing the annual report, there was still a business activity that had a great impact on the financial data of the company’s periodic report (purchasing live cattle in 2021) that had not been verified clearly.\n\nOn May 12, Fucheng Co., Ltd. issued another announcement on the commitment to participate in the operation of Hebei Fucheng Food Co., Ltd. as the actual controller. Cheng Jing has agreed to sign a written confirmation on the company’s periodic reports and financial statements.\n\nIn addition, Fucheng Co., Ltd. also made it clear about the purchase verification of live cattle, “After the occurrence of the problem, in early May 2022, the company recalled all the purchasing personnel involved in buying cattle in 2021 from all over the country, spent several days with the company’s accountant to jointly verify the situation of buying cattle in 2021 and supplement relevant materials, basically obtained all the certificates of inconsistent transactions of invoice and payment capital flow of buying cattle in 2021, and finally met the accurate capital expenditure and asset cost of the financial director for the company’s large purchase of biological assets of live cattle in 2021 Confirmation requirements of this document. “\n\nShareholder welfare is coming!

{"id": "Y4MoUpVAHt7pupc640fP0NpDmBkV2I-7Cw00yVj1zYc", "title": "\"Fixed income +\" fund is the most complained about? Institutions suggest long-term holding", "body": "Recently, some fund companies reported that the market has fluctuated since this year, and the market sentiment is more anxious. However, among all kinds of products, the “fixed income +” investors with relatively stable performance have the most complaints. According to the analysis of some people in the fund industry, the risk preference of the people who invest in the “fixed income +” fund is relatively low, and their mentality is more volatile in the face of the decline of net worth. In the long term, some fund companies suggest that for some stable “fixed income +” products, investors do not need to choose the time, bargain hunting layout and long-term holding.\n\n“Solid income +” Jimin\n\nMentality is more easily disturbed\n\nSome fund companies told reporters, “the market has been poor this year, but according to the feedback from customer service, the customers of equity funds are in a relatively calm mood, while the ‘fixed income +’ funds can not accept the withdrawal of net value, and the number of complaints from customers is the most.”\n\n“Fixed income +” is mainly composed of “fixed income” and “+”. Specifically, this kind of fund aims to obtain absolute income, build basic income with fixed income assets, and allocate equity risk assets and quantitative strategies on the premise of strictly controlling withdrawal, so as to achieve an investment system with thickened income and smooth fluctuation.\n\nIn 2022, the “fixed income +” once known as steady income can not escape the net loss. According to the data, as of May 10, the average yield of “fixed income +” funds (calculated separately, the same below) fell by 4.26% during the year, and only 125 had positive returns, accounting for only 10%. Although the overall situation is still strong relative to the market, there are still many products with losses of more than 20% leading the decline of peers. The common feature of these products is the relatively heavy position of convertible bonds, and the trend of convertible bonds is highly related to positive stocks, and the losses even exceed some equity funds.\n\nInvestors have “voted on the product” in the market. According to statistics, in the first quarter, nearly 62% of the “fixed income +” funds were in the state of net redemption, among which the funds with more equity investment and higher positions in stocks and convertible bonds had greater redemption pressure. According to the calculation of Haitong Securities Research Report, the scale of stock “fixed income +” funds in the first quarter of 2022 decreased by 4.8% month on month, of which the scale of partial debt hybrid varieties decreased more, with a month on month decline of 100.77 billion yuan, and the scale of secondary debt base and primary debt base increased to a certain extent. The redemption pressure of “fixed income +” funds is mainly in partial debt hybrid funds, with a net redemption of 72.16 billion in the first quarter.\n\nWith regard to the phenomenon of more complaints from “fixed income +” customers, a large public offering person told reporters, “A considerable number of customers who buy such funds are investors who are keen on bank financial management or have only been exposed to steady income products such as yu’ebao. Their risk appetite is relatively low, so they are prone to fluctuations in the face of losses. On the contrary, many investors who buy equity funds have expectations for pullback and dare to increase positions or copy the bottom to dilute costs in the event of a sharp decline.”\n\nBargain hunting layout long-term holding\n\nWhen the net value of the fund is retreated, Jimin’s simple desire is also downgraded from making money to capital recovery. So what’s next? The public funder said, “the average holding time of many users of our fixed income products is three to five years, ignoring short-term fluctuations and holding for a long time to earn stable income. Although the ‘fixed income +’ has fallen so much, our colleagues in the investment and research department believe that even if some products are losing 4% left and right, there is still hope to gain positive income within the year.”\n\nTianhong fund also believes that for some stable “fixed income +” products, investors do not need to choose a special time to bargain hunting layout and long-term holding. Compared with equity funds with greater volatility, the relatively controllable and stable “fixed income +” product is still a fund suitable for most investors.\n\nLooking forward to the future, Guojin Securities believes that under the influence of repeated epidemics, international political frictions and other factors, there is a certain game space in the bond market, but the interest rate is relatively low and the odds are limited. It is suggested that the pure bond should focus on the coupon strategy and appropriately participate in the interest rate band. In terms of the equity market, the periodic panic has been released to a certain extent, and there is no need to be too pessimistic at the current time. However, considering that there are many uncertain factors in the market and the mood is fragile, it is suggested to focus on stable and balanced varieties and moderately participate in the allocation of balanced and stable “fixed income +” products.\n\nIn addition, Guojin Securities pointed out that from the perspective of fund managers’ investment operation and market in the first quarter report of 2022, there are certain differences in the market. Some fund managers believe that the loose monetary policy is more deterministic, and there is no doubt about their determination to stabilize growth. The epidemic is only a short-term disturbance, and there is a great probability that China’s macroeconomic bottom will gradually stabilize.\n\nSina statement: this message is reproduced from Sina cooperative media.

URLを確認する\n3. 疑わしいと思ったら焦りに負けず、チャットで正しいかを確認する(できない場合はscamの可能性高い)\n4. サイトのmint数、送り先コントラクトを確認し、その数に不都合がないかを確認する\n\n## DMは詐欺！！！！DMは詐欺！！！！DMは詐欺！！！\n\n### 1対1の取引をしない\n\nまず、DMで相手とやり取りすること自体リスクがあります。誰もが見えるパブリックな場所で交渉しましょう。交渉するにしても相手のリンクを踏まないようにしましょう。\n\nscamの数としては私見では Telegram > Discord > Twitterです。まずDMは詐欺前提であることを忘れず心置きなくブロックもしましょう。\n\nDMに関係するscamには思いついた限りでいくつかのscamがあります。\n\n1. 偽mintサイトへ誘導\n2. あなたのNFTがほしいからと交渉する\n3. クリエイター向けに詳細をpdfなど別途ファイルで添付する\n4. MODになってほしいからと偽discordリンクに招待、その後verifyのためと謳ったscamサイトに誘導し、Discordのトークンを抜き取りアカウントを奪われます。\n5. トラブルに会った場合、サポートするという内容のscamがTwitter、Discord、Telegramに大量に来ますが、1対1のサポートはまずscamです。\n\n## 偽リンクを踏まない\n\n### 広告における偽物\n\nGoogle Search、Twitterの広告には偽プロジェクトを謳い、あなたの資産を奪おうとしてきます。そういう場合は、公式Twitter、公式Discord、coingecko、Defillamaなど信頼の置けるサイトから飛ぶようにします。\n\n公式Twitterはフォロワーの数、共通でフォローしてる人の数から判断してください。フォロー数にもよりますが、0\\~10人程度なら怪しくて、たとえ数万人居たとしてもフォロワーを購入しています。\n\n### Twitter\n\n偽のサポート、公式マークが付いている、フォロワーが多い。どれも全部関係ないです。共通フォローが多いかを確認しましょう。\n\n公式を装った詐欺への誘導もよくあります。紛らわしいので非フォロワー、非フォローからの通知をoffにしましょう。\n\n### 偽のDiscordリンク\n\n![doodles公式](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z54azGgPUHad9zG1kYIen.png?height=383&width=759)\n\n例えば、DoodlesのDiscordリンクはdiscord.gg/doodlesです。これはサーバーブースターというDiscordの機能によってレベル3を達成すると招待コードを好きな文字列に変更できます。\n\n例えば、僕が大きなNFTプロジェクト(akashi)を持っていて、50人だけ招待したいとします。通常discordの招待はランダムな文字列になり、abcdefgというコードを50人の制限をかけてTwitterで配布します。51人目以降はそのdiscordには招待コードが切れましたというメッセージが表示されます。\n\nここにscamを狙っているAさんがいるとします。僕のabcdefgというコードが切れた後だと、ブーストしているレベル3のdiscordサーバーはabcdefgという招待コードを作成できます。それを狙って、abcdefgというコードで偽akashiサーバーに誘導します。そこで偽サイトから(以下略)\n\n### Telegram\n\n自分が被害にあったのはこれです。公式を名乗った偽のtelegramがたくさんあります。\n\nさあ名前だけを見てどれが公式かわかりますか？僕にはわかりませんが、選択されているのと、Announcements以外は偽のセールが行われていました。\n\nTelegramはもうscamの温床になってるので、自分は殆ど使っていません。偽公式に簡単に辿れるのでかなり注意が必要です。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JO7HU5KI1MJ0zMNCGPrpC.png?height=379&width=567)\n\n### Instagram\n\nInstagramには公式以外にもたくさんの偽物アカウントが存在し、Twitterと違って、数万人フォロワーがいることが多いです。中には偽物のほうがフォロワー数が多いケースも有るため、気をつけなければなりません。\n\nInstagramが一番怖いです。\n\n### Openseaの偽コレクション\n\n1. 公式マークは関係ない\n2. 公式Discord、Twitterに記載されているofficial linkからOpenseaに飛ぶ\n3. コントラクトアドレスでOpenseaの検索をする\n4. 安い価格に飛びつかず、出来高を確認し、10ETH以下なら偽のコレクションと判断する(そもそも流動性のないプロジェクトに飛びつかないよう)\n\n最近Phantom Network(PxN)という大きなプロジェクトのmintが開始されました。もちろんそれを狙って、偽コレクションも始動します。\n\n0x160c404b2b49cbc3240055ceaee026df1e8497a0はPxNのコントラクトで事前に公開されていました。以下画像2枚目にある通り既に**偽のコレクション**は消されていますが、偽のコレクションで100ETH以上の取引がありました。\n\n[https://twitter.com/dingalingts/status/1522055650028978176](https://twitter.com/dingalingts/status/1522055650028978176)\n\nなお既に犯人は特定されています。\n\n[https://twitter.com/Serpent/status/1522059672886251521](https://twitter.com/Serpent/status/1522059672886251521)\n\n## 偽サイトにアクセスした場合\n\nウォレット接続はただRead権限を与えるだけのはずなので問題ないです。署名(signature)、トランザクション、approveを行うと、そのウォレットを危険に晒すことになります。仮に行った場合は、revokeする、そのウォレットからすべての資産を移動するなどして二度と使わないなどの対応を取り、資産を守ります。\n\nrevoke先\n\n[https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker](https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker)\n\nappriveの仕組み\n\n[https://youtu.be/N05FR_e7124?t=949](https://youtu.be/N05FR_e7124?t=949)\n\n### Metamaskを捨ててRabbyを利用する\n\nセキュリティ対策がたくさん盛り込まれています。これだけで9割は防げるはずです。\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/yakisobaminister.eth/nKCSnpvrobSShtdESJArIUwOIXYUR4exyu1O4Opkooc](https://mirror.xyz/yakisobaminister.eth/nKCSnpvrobSShtdESJArIUwOIXYUR4exyu1O4Opkooc)\n\n### 偽のNFT、トークン\n\n例えばですが、以下のようなよく知らないコレクションがhiddenやopenseaそのままに送信されることがあります。それらをhiddenに動かしたり、別のアドレスに送ってしまうとウォレット内資産が取られる危険性があるため、触らずにそのままにしておきましょう。\n\n![偽のコレクション](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KfRFbQOYObr6HXrC3BqXd.png?height=506&width=1114)\n\n![謎エアドロップ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XEBYfUFHfMJ5IWjE1UrSP.png?height=507&width=1229)\n\n![アクセスしたらお金上げる系](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YvPrQ4W_Aeuc-hMYTJQXq.png?height=283&width=1130)\n\n### テストネット\n\nNFTだけやってる人にありがちですが、ETHメインネットとテストネットのトークンを同一視してしまうことがあります。テストネットトークンは誰でも無限に受け取れて、それ自体に価値がないので、rapsten,kovan,rinkbyなどのトークンで取引を成立してはいけません。必ず相手のリンクは踏まずに、opensea、looksrare、x2y2など公式のリンクから出品しましょう。\n\n[https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/)\n\n### フィッシングメール\n\nこれがなんだかんだ簡単で引っかかる人が多いです。最近はLedgerのメールアドレスが流出して、フィッシングメールが届くようになったようです。\n\n基本的にWeb3ではメールを使いません。メールが届くのはサービスに登録したものです。Openseaから取引完了のメールが届くでしょうけど、僕はフィッシングと紛らわしいため全部ブロックしています。Web3とは関係ないと思いきや、Appleアカウントのフィッシングから資産を取られたケースもあります。Metamask(メール登録箇所ない)から来ることもありますが、まずありえないので、定期的にメールアドレスの整理を行いましょう。疑わしい場合は誰かに確認を。\n\n### 番外編 偽giveaway\n\n本物に混じって偽giveawayが行われていることがあります。今だと日本ではstepnが多いですが、人気NFTプロジェクトにも例があります。\n\nフォロワーを無料で獲得するためにやっているため、野放しにするといずれ詐欺アカウントに変容し、詐欺に加担することにつながるので、避けましょう。自分は偽giveaway参加者はいつか自分も被害に合うかもしれないと思って全てブロックしてます。", "timestamp": 1653265203, "digest": "7a9z0TakP7y9xHb7kocA8lHDpBu9-1PaaHnqfib2M14", "contributor": "0xAe74399237E02458aa42283e7c3ef2929AD4896C"}

A month ago, Toshiba shareholders rejected the plan to split the company in two. Major shareholders outside Japan voted against the proposal, saying it would be better to sell the whole company to private equity firms, but management earlier rejected the proposal.\n\nOther private capital is also planning\n\nOther private equity firms, such as CVC Capital Partners and Bain Capital, are also weighing Toshiba’s potential offer, Bloomberg reported. People familiar with the matter said that CVC is negotiating with several acquisition companies and local fund companies in Japan on the joint bidding.\n\nGiven the size of the deal and political factors, several buyout companies are considering forming alliances, they said.\n\nThe Toshiba acquisition may be the largest private equity transaction in Japan’s history. According to Bloomberg data, this potential acquisition will add a large number to the total scale of Japanese enterprises’ Mergers and acquisitions of US $51 billion in the past year.\n\nPeople familiar with the matter said that at present, the discussion between the parties is still in the preliminary stage, and these acquisition companies may not decide to continue to promote the proposal in the end.\n\nOr introduce other investment banks\n\nToshiba may announce its choice of banks this week to help it evaluate its acquisition interests.

However, he still hyped the Taiwan issue and said, “what happened in Ukraine must not be staged in Asia.”\n\nCampbell made this statement while participating in the activities of the United States think tank Institute for peace (usip). A day later, the summit between the leaders of the United States and ASEAN countries will be held in Washington.\n\nIn response to the US State Department’s earlier revision of the “list of facts on us Taiwan Relations”, Campbell denied that this incident reflected changes in US policy towards Taiwan.\n\n“I can say very directly that our policy has not changed and remains consistent.”\n\nThe moderator then asked, “does this mean that the United States does not support ‘Taiwan independence’?”\n\n“Yes,” Campbell replied, “this is the long-term position of the United States.”\n\n”What about the one China policy? “The host asked.\n\n”It is still working. “Campbell said.\n\nVideo screenshot of Campbell’s participation in usip activities on May 11\n\nFor the upcoming summit between the leaders of the United States and ASEAN countries, Campbell said that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine does occupy a lot of energy of the U.S. government, but the United States has deeply realized that it can not be distracted from the “Indo Pacific” issue, and the United States will continue to seek to increase investment and contacts with ASEAN countries.\n\nHe revealed that both the Taiwan issue and the Ukrainian issue are topics that the United States will discuss with ASEAN leaders. He also claimed that the United States hopes to take measures to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, does not seek to take provocative actions, and also hopes to clearly prevent the intention of provocative actions. “What happened in Ukraine must not be staged in Asia.”\n\nOn May 5 local time, the website of the US State Department updated and revised the “fact list of us Taiwan Relations”.  \n\nOn the 10th, price of the US State Department insisted that the unofficial relationship between the United States and Taiwan was “as strong as a rock” and that the so-called “list of facts” of the US side accurately reflected this relationship. On the other hand, he said that the US side still adhered to the “one China” policy and the expression changed, but the basic policy remained unchanged.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian stressed at a regular press conference on the 10th that there is only one China in the world. Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory. The government of the people’s Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing the whole of China, which is a general consensus and recognized norm of international relations in the international community.\n\nZhao Lijian said that history cannot be tampered with, facts cannot be denied, and right and wrong cannot be distorted. In the three Sino US joint communiques, the United States made solemn commitments on the Taiwan issue and the one China principle.\n\nHe pointed out that the US side’s revision of the “fact list of us Taiwan Relations” is a small move to empty out the one China principle. This practice of engaging in political manipulation on the Taiwan issue and trying to change the current situation in the Taiwan Strait is bound to burn itself. The United States should abide by the one China principle and the provisions of the three Sino US joint communiques, abide by the political commitments made to China on the Taiwan issue, implement President Biden’s statement that the United States does not support “Taiwan independence”, and stop engaging in political manipulation and using Taiwan to control China through Taiwan related issues.", "timestamp": 1653267072, "digest": "iLrCmEke1BbDqUKOKrfrfssRvr4T1I2Lrdzt5I5C27E", "contributor": "0x8E848f54B35cbA526E8eD6EC78886147D471d6Ee"}

Therefore, the decision to shut down its 3G network is a key decision.\n\nAfter Vodafone and EE, two other operators in the UK, announced similar network shutdown announcements, the decision of 3 UK to shut down 3G mobile services will be able to release the spectrum and plough again, so as to improve the quality of 4G network and expand 5g services faster.\n\nVirgin media O2, the fourth mobile network operator in the UK, has not announced its decision to close the 3G network.\n\nThroughout the UK, 3G services have been largely replaced by the availability of 4G and 5g services. According to 3 UK, 5g is now more popular than 3G in the UK market, and 5g will account for 35% of its total mobile network usage by the end of this year.\n\nDavid Hennessy, chief technology officer of 3 UK, said: “3G started the mobile revolution - and brought 3 UK into the UK market 20 years ago - but the future undoubtedly belongs to 5g. As we continue to launch ultra-high speed connections, we will be able to stop using 3G in our network by the end of 2024, not only by upgrading existing 4G sites, but also by building new 5g sites.”\n\nHowever, the shutdown of 3G network means that some users must upgrade their terminal equipment before the end of 2024, so as to make a smooth transition to 4G and 5g services. This is particularly important for 3UK compared with its UK competitors, as the company has no 2G network for customers to return after the 3G network is closed.\n\nOn the other hand, after Vodafone and EE shut down 3G, in addition to 4G and 5g services, the two companies will continue to provide 2G services.

Subsequently, the State Council issued the outline for the development of Chinese women (2021-2030) and the outline for the development of Chinese children (2021-2030). The outline requires to prevent and reduce child injuries caused by products, strengthen product quality and safety supervision, improve the mandatory national standard system for children’s products, and improve product safety warning signs. At the same time, it puts forward some key contents, such as protecting women’s reproductive rights and interests and perfecting the supporting measures of three child reproductive policy. With the strong support and guidance of relevant national policies, as the link between women and children, maternal and infant industries and products have received extensive attention and rapid development.\n\nAt the same time, with the emergence and repetition of COVID-19 and the aggravation of environmental pollution, people pay more attention to daily health safety and health protection, focusing on all aspects of food, clothing, housing and transportation. As an indispensable resource in life, people have higher and higher requirements for water. Therefore, the quality of water also determines the quality of people’s life to a certain extent. The health and safety of water related products can not be ignored. Domestic water products should pay more attention to the special needs of different groups, such as mothers and infants. Infants and young children will face a variety of threats such as bacteria and allergens. Therefore, the material and performance of products need to be further improved to achieve high efficiency, energy saving, green and health.\n\nThe l1pb26-ngb380 24K gas-fired heating water heater produced by Beijing Qingdong Nabian thermal energy equipment Co., Ltd. has passed the chct-02-137-2022 implementation rules for the certification of mother and child gas-fired water heaters jointly formulated by zhongjiayuan (Beijing) testing and Certification Co., Ltd. and the Testing Institute of environment and health related products of China Academy of household appliances. The environment and health related products testing Institute conducted product testing on l1pb26-ngb380 24K gas heating water heater. The inspection results and quality management system were reviewed by zhongjiayuan (Beijing) testing and Certification Co., Ltd. and met the requirements of certification rules. L1pb26-ngb380 24K gas-fired heating water heater has obtained the first certification certificate of maternal and infant gas-fired water heater in 2022.\n\nThe certification of maternal and infant gas-fired water heater starts from the focus of maternal and infant population on the pain points in the use of domestic hot water. It not only considers the comfortable feeling of water temperature, but also strictly controls the safety and health of water quality, so as to fully meet the special needs of mothers and infants for water. At the same time, the certification rules also take full account of the safety indicators such as material health and safety, corrosion resistance, and the precipitation of harmful substances of product components, as well as the characteristic indicators such as sterilization, antibacterial and particulate filtration, so as to take full care of the baby’s delicate skin from bacteria, impurities and other attacks, and establish a solid safe and healthy green barrier for infants, pregnant and postpartum mothers.\n\nThe Testing Institute of environment and health related products of China Household Appliances Research Institute has corresponding testing capabilities and testing personnel. It can provide relevant certification and testing services for enterprises, meet various needs of enterprises, help enterprises publicize and promote, and guide consumers to choose rationally.", "timestamp": 1653267708, "digest": "JG-QejfHByLq96JMrJZGWdgZ_60jRMWrXKEamfUCBcQ", "contributor": "0xcdE808e918031379D7B48865c894dd1ed88aB90A"}

URLを確認する\n3. 疑わしいと思ったら焦りに負けず、チャットで正しいかを確認する(できない場合はscamの可能性高い)\n4. サイトのmint数、送り先コントラクトを確認し、その数に不都合がないかを確認する\n\n## DMは詐欺！！！！DMは詐欺！！！！DMは詐欺！！！\n\n### 1対1の取引をしない\n\nまず、DMで相手とやり取りすること自体リスクがあります。誰もが見えるパブリックな場所で交渉しましょう。交渉するにしても相手のリンクを踏まないようにしましょう。\n\nscamの数としては私見では Telegram > Discord > Twitterです。まずDMは詐欺前提であることを忘れず心置きなくブロックもしましょう。\n\nDMに関係するscamには思いついた限りでいくつかのscamがあります。\n\n1. 偽mintサイトへ誘導\n2. あなたのNFTがほしいからと交渉する\n3. クリエイター向けに詳細をpdfなど別途ファイルで添付する\n4. MODになってほしいからと偽discordリンクに招待、その後verifyのためと謳ったscamサイトに誘導し、Discordのトークンを抜き取りアカウントを奪われます。\n5. トラブルに会った場合、サポートするという内容のscamがTwitter、Discord、Telegramに大量に来ますが、1対1のサポートはまずscamです。\n\n## 偽リンクを踏まない\n\n### 広告における偽物\n\nGoogle Search、Twitterの広告には偽プロジェクトを謳い、あなたの資産を奪おうとしてきます。そういう場合は、公式Twitter、公式Discord、coingecko、Defillamaなど信頼の置けるサイトから飛ぶようにします。\n\n公式Twitterはフォロワーの数、共通でフォローしてる人の数から判断してください。フォロー数にもよりますが、0\\~10人程度なら怪しくて、たとえ数万人居たとしてもフォロワーを購入しています。\n\n### Twitter\n\n偽のサポート、公式マークが付いている、フォロワーが多い。どれも全部関係ないです。共通フォローが多いかを確認しましょう。\n\n紛らわしいので非フォロワー、フォローからの通知をoffにしましょう。\n\n### 偽のDiscordリンク\n\n![doodles公式](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z54azGgPUHad9zG1kYIen.png?height=383&width=759)\n\n例えば、DoodlesのDiscordリンクはdiscord.gg/doodlesです。これはサーバーブースターというDiscordの機能によってレベル3を達成すると招待コードを好きな文字列に変更できます。\n\n例えば、僕が大きなNFTプロジェクト(akashi)を持っていて、50人だけ招待したいとします。通常discordの招待はランダムな文字列になり、abcdefgというコードを50人の制限をかけてTwitterで配布します。51人目以降はそのdiscordには招待コードが切れましたというメッセージが表示されます。\n\nここにscamを狙っているAさんがいるとします。僕のabcdefgというコードが切れた後だと、ブーストしているレベル3のdiscordサーバーはabcdefgという招待コードを作成できます。それを狙って、abcdefgというコードで偽akashiサーバーに誘導します。そこで偽サイトから(以下略)\n\n### Telegram\n\n自分が被害にあったのはこれです。公式を名乗った偽のtelegramがたくさんあります。\n\nさあ名前だけを見てどれが公式かわかりますか？僕にはわかりませんが、選択されているのと、Announcements以外は偽のセールが行われていました。\n\nTelegramはもうscamの温床になってるので、自分は殆ど使っていません。偽公式に簡単に辿れるのでかなり注意が必要です。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JO7HU5KI1MJ0zMNCGPrpC.png?height=379&width=567)\n\n### Instagram\n\nInstagramには公式以外にもたくさんの偽物アカウントが存在し、Twitterと違って、数万人フォロワーがいることが多いです。中には偽物のほうがフォロワー数が多いケースも有るため、気をつけなければなりません。\n\nInstagramが一番怖いです。\n\n### Openseaの偽コレクション\n\n1. 公式マークは関係ない\n2. 公式Discord、Twitterに記載されているofficial linkからOpenseaに飛ぶ\n3. コントラクトアドレスでOpenseaの検索をする\n4. 安い価格に飛びつかず、出来高を確認し、10ETH以下なら偽のコレクションと判断する(そもそも流動性のないプロジェクトに飛びつかないよう)\n\n最近Phantom Network(PxN)という大きなプロジェクトのmintが開始されました。もちろんそれを狙って、偽コレクションも始動します。\n\n0x160c404b2b49cbc3240055ceaee026df1e8497a0はPxNのコントラクトで事前に公開されていました。以下画像2枚目にある通り既にコレクションは消されていますが、偽のコレクションで100ETH以上の取引がありました。\n\n[https://twitter.com/dingalingts/status/1522055650028978176](https://twitter.com/dingalingts/status/1522055650028978176)\n\nなお既に犯人は特定されています。\n\n[https://twitter.com/Serpent/status/1522059672886251521](https://twitter.com/Serpent/status/1522059672886251521)\n\n## 偽サイトにアクセスした場合\n\nウォレット接続はただRead権限を与えるだけのはずなので問題ないです。署名(signature)、トランザクション、approveを行うと、そのウォレットを危険に晒すことになります。仮に行った場合は、revokeする、そのウォレットからすべての資産を移動するなどして二度と使わないなどの対応を取り、資産を守ります。\n\nrevoke先\n\n[https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker](https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker)\n\nappriveの仕組み\n\n[https://youtu.be/N05FR_e7124?t=949](https://youtu.be/N05FR_e7124?t=949)\n\n### Metamaskを捨ててRabbyを利用する\n\nセキュリティ対策がたくさん盛り込まれています。これだけで9割は防げるはずです。\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/yakisobaminister.eth/nKCSnpvrobSShtdESJArIUwOIXYUR4exyu1O4Opkooc](https://mirror.xyz/yakisobaminister.eth/nKCSnpvrobSShtdESJArIUwOIXYUR4exyu1O4Opkooc)\n\n### 偽のNFT、トークン\n\n例えばですが、以下のようなよく知らないコレクションがhiddenやopenseaそのままに送信されることがあります。それらをhiddenに動かしたり、別のアドレスに送ってしまうとウォレット内資産が取られる危険性があるため、触らずにそのままにしておきましょう。\n\n![偽のコレクション](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KfRFbQOYObr6HXrC3BqXd.png?height=506&width=1114)\n\n![謎エアドロップ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XEBYfUFHfMJ5IWjE1UrSP.png?height=507&width=1229)\n\n![アクセスしたらお金上げる系](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YvPrQ4W_Aeuc-hMYTJQXq.png?height=283&width=1130)\n\n### テストネット\n\nNFTだけやってる人にありがちですが、ETHメインネットとテストネットのトークンを同一視してしまうことがあります。テストネットトークンは誰でも無限に受け取れて、それ自体に価値がないので、rapsten,kovan,rinkbyなどのトークンで取引を成立してはいけません。必ず相手のリンクは踏まずに、opensea、looksrare、x2y2など公式のリンクから出品しましょう。\n\n[https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/)\n\n### フィッシングメール\n\nこれがなんだかんだ簡単で引っかかる人が多いです。最近はLedgerのメールアドレスが流出して、フィッシングメールが届くようになったようです。\n\n基本的にWeb3ではメールを使いません。メールが届くのはサービスに登録したものです。Openseaから取引完了のメールが届くでしょうけど、僕はフィッシングと紛らわしいため全部ブロックしています。Web3とは関係ないと思いきや、Appleアカウントのフィッシングから資産を取られたケースもあります。Metamask(メール登録箇所ない)から来ることもありますが、まずありえないので、定期的にメールアドレスの整理を行いましょう。疑わしい場合は誰かに確認を。\n\n### 番外編 偽giveaway\n\n本物に混じって偽giveawayが行われていることがあります。今だと日本ではstepnが多いですが、人気NFTプロジェクトにも例があります。\n\nフォロワーを無料で獲得するためにやっているため、野放しにするといずれ詐欺アカウントに変容し、詐欺に加担することにつながるので、避けましょう。自分は偽giveaway参加者はいつか自分も被害に合うかもしれないと思って全てブロックしてます。", "timestamp": 1653264074, "digest": "7a9z0TakP7y9xHb7kocA8lHDpBu9-1PaaHnqfib2M14", "contributor": "0xAe74399237E02458aa42283e7c3ef2929AD4896C"}

MODになってほしいからと偽discordリンクに招待、その後verifyのためと謳ったscamサイトに誘導し、Discordのトークンを抜き取りアカウントを奪われます。\n5. トラブルに会った場合、サポートするという内容のscamがTwitter、Discord、Telegramに大量に来ますが、1対1のサポートはまずscamです。\n\n## 偽リンクを踏まない\n\n### 広告における偽物\n\nGoogle Search、Twitterの広告には偽プロジェクトを謳い、あなたの資産を奪おうとしてきます。そういう場合は、公式Twitter、公式Discord、coingecko、Defillamaなど信頼の置けるサイトから飛ぶようにします。\n\n公式Twitterはフォロワーの数、共通でフォローしてる人の数から判断してください。フォロー数にもよりますが、0\\~10人程度なら怪しくて、たとえ数万人居たとしてもフォロワーを購入しています。\n\n### Twitter\n\n偽のサポート、公式マークが付いている、フォロワーが多い。どれも全部関係ないです。共通フォローが多いかを確認しましょう。\n\n紛らわしいので非フォロワー、フォローからの通知をoffにしましょう。\n\n### 偽のDiscordリンク\n\n![doodles公式](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z54azGgPUHad9zG1kYIen.png?height=383&width=759)\n\n例えば、DoodlesのDiscordリンクはdiscord.gg/doodlesです。これはサーバーブースターというDiscordの機能によってレベル3を達成すると招待コードを好きな文字列に変更できます。\n\n例えば、僕が大きなNFTプロジェクト(akashi)を持っていて、50人だけ招待したいとします。通常discordの招待はランダムな文字列になり、abcdefgというコードを50人の制限をかけてTwitterで配布します。51人目以降はそのdiscordには招待コードが切れましたというメッセージが表示されます。\n\nここにscamを狙っているAさんがいるとします。僕のabcdefgというコードが切れた後だと、ブーストしているレベル3のdiscordサーバーはabcdefgという招待コードを作成できます。それを狙って、abcdefgというコードで偽akashiサーバーに誘導します。そこで偽サイトから(以下略)\n\n### Telegram\n\n自分が被害にあったのはこれです。公式を名乗った偽のtelegramがたくさんあります。\n\nさあ名前だけを見てどれが公式かわかりますか？僕にはわかりませんが、選択されているのと、Announcements以外は偽のセールが行われていました。\n\nTelegramはもうscamの温床になってるので、自分は殆ど使っていません。偽公式に簡単に辿れるのでかなり注意が必要です。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JO7HU5KI1MJ0zMNCGPrpC.png?height=379&width=567)\n\n### Instagram\n\nInstagramには公式以外にもたくさんの偽物アカウントが存在し、Twitterと違って、数万人フォロワーがいることが多いです。中には偽物のほうがフォロワー数が多いケースも有るため、気をつけなければなりません。\n\nInstagramが一番怖いです。\n\n### Openseaの偽コレクション\n\n1. 公式マークは関係ない\n2. 公式Discord、Twitterに記載されているofficial linkからOpenseaに飛ぶ\n3. コントラクトアドレスでOpenseaの検索をする\n4. 安い価格に飛びつかず、出来高を確認し、10ETH以下なら偽のコレクションと判断する(そもそも流動性のないプロジェクトに飛びつかないよう)\n\n最近Phantom Network(PxN)という大きなプロジェクトのmintが開始されました。もちろんそれを狙って、偽コレクションも始動します。\n\n0x160c404b2b49cbc3240055ceaee026df1e8497a0はPxNのコントラクトで事前に公開されていました。以下画像2枚目にある通り既に**偽のコレクション**は消されていますが、偽のコレクションで100ETH以上の取引がありました。\n\n[https://twitter.com/dingalingts/status/1522055650028978176](https://twitter.com/dingalingts/status/1522055650028978176)\n\nなお既に犯人は特定されています。\n\n[https://twitter.com/Serpent/status/1522059672886251521](https://twitter.com/Serpent/status/1522059672886251521)\n\n## 偽サイトにアクセスした場合\n\nウォレット接続はただRead権限を与えるだけのはずなので問題ないです。署名(signature)、トランザクション、approveを行うと、そのウォレットを危険に晒すことになります。仮に行った場合は、revokeする、そのウォレットからすべての資産を移動するなどして二度と使わないなどの対応を取り、資産を守ります。\n\nrevoke先\n\n[https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker](https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker)\n\nappriveの仕組み\n\n[https://youtu.be/N05FR_e7124?t=949](https://youtu.be/N05FR_e7124?t=949)\n\n### Metamaskを捨ててRabbyを利用する\n\nセキュリティ対策がたくさん盛り込まれています。これだけで9割は防げるはずです。\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/yakisobaminister.eth/nKCSnpvrobSShtdESJArIUwOIXYUR4exyu1O4Opkooc](https://mirror.xyz/yakisobaminister.eth/nKCSnpvrobSShtdESJArIUwOIXYUR4exyu1O4Opkooc)\n\n### 偽のNFT、トークン\n\n例えばですが、以下のようなよく知らないコレクションがhiddenやopenseaそのままに送信されることがあります。それらをhiddenに動かしたり、別のアドレスに送ってしまうとウォレット内資産が取られる危険性があるため、触らずにそのままにしておきましょう。\n\n![偽のコレクション](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KfRFbQOYObr6HXrC3BqXd.png?height=506&width=1114)\n\n![謎エアドロップ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XEBYfUFHfMJ5IWjE1UrSP.png?height=507&width=1229)\n\n![アクセスしたらお金上げる系](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YvPrQ4W_Aeuc-hMYTJQXq.png?height=283&width=1130)\n\n### テストネット\n\nNFTだけやってる人にありがちですが、ETHメインネットとテストネットのトークンを同一視してしまうことがあります。テストネットトークンは誰でも無限に受け取れて、それ自体に価値がないので、rapsten,kovan,rinkbyなどのトークンで取引を成立してはいけません。必ず相手のリンクは踏まずに、opensea、looksrare、x2y2など公式のリンクから出品しましょう。\n\n[https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/)\n\n### フィッシングメール\n\nこれがなんだかんだ簡単で引っかかる人が多いです。最近はLedgerのメールアドレスが流出して、フィッシングメールが届くようになったようです。\n\n基本的にWeb3ではメールを使いません。メールが届くのはサービスに登録したものです。Openseaから取引完了のメールが届くでしょうけど、僕はフィッシングと紛らわしいため全部ブロックしています。Web3とは関係ないと思いきや、Appleアカウントのフィッシングから資産を取られたケースもあります。Metamask(メール登録箇所ない)から来ることもありますが、まずありえないので、定期的にメールアドレスの整理を行いましょう。疑わしい場合は誰かに確認を。\n\n### 番外編 偽giveaway\n\n本物に混じって偽giveawayが行われていることがあります。今だと日本ではstepnが多いですが、人気NFTプロジェクトにも例があります。\n\nフォロワーを無料で獲得するためにやっているため、野放しにするといずれ詐欺アカウントに変容し、詐欺に加担することにつながるので、避けましょう。自分は偽giveaway参加者はいつか自分も被害に合うかもしれないと思って全てブロックしてます。", "timestamp": 1653264136, "digest": "7a9z0TakP7y9xHb7kocA8lHDpBu9-1PaaHnqfib2M14", "contributor": "0xAe74399237E02458aa42283e7c3ef2929AD4896C"}

Here, you can enjoy the “Forbidden City” built by LEGO and taste the siphon coffee of Starbucks Zhenxuan store\n\nChangying Tianjie is indispensable. In the eight years since its opening, Changying Tianjie has invigorated the consumption of the whole Changying plot and become a real traffic mall. It has occupied the top of Beijing’s “shopping center heat list” for a long time. Changying business district has also become one of the most famous and dynamic business districts in Beijing.\n\n△ Changying Tianjie in the evening\n\n 1. “Thousands of people and thousands of faces”\n 2. It has been nearly three years since I last visited Changying Tianjie. The impressions of the two visits were completely different. In 2019, the epidemic has not been rampant, and the customers of Changying Tianjie are still bustling, but the grade of the brand is always lower, which makes it feel like shopping in department stores and hypermarkets.\n 3. Now when I come to Changying Tianjie, I obviously feel that the atmosphere of the mall is more fashionable. It not only revitalizes many first-class brands, but also introduces some major luxury brands. Different from the contrast of the author’s visit for many years, a nearby resident said that “it is updated almost every year. I watch it change bit by bit”.\n 4. Changyingtian street is divided into East and west districts, with 5 floors above the ground and 3 floors underground. The newly renovated Eastern District and the major brands to be opened are particularly eye-catching: Dior, Chanel, Gucci, Guerlain, pola, o’shudan and other high-tech brands gather here. New entrants of lululemon, Claudie pilot, Tommy Hilfiger, lacoste and other tonal costumes also gather in groups.\n 5. The biggest feeling of wandering among them is like being in Sanlitun for a while and then arriving at Chaoyang Joy City. The “blue frog”, who once ranked first in the hamburger list in Beijing, has been stationed in Sanlitun trendy people gathering place for 13 years. Now, there is a blue frog in Changying Tianjie street, and also ranked first in the list of Changying Western food environment; Dayu Teppanyaki has a per capita of 260%. The first shopping centers to enter are Sanlitun taiguli and Chaoyang Joy City, followed by changyingtian street, which also attracts Dayu.\n 6. In other words, if you look at Changying Tianjie this time, it is more fashionable and younger. More importantly, there are all kinds of high, middle and low grades here. In addition to major brands, Zara, ur, hot wind, pleasant poetry and singing, and perfect diary are interspersed. They can’t enter the circle of high-end consumption, and popular consumption can make up for it. The underground food city surrounded by Xincheng fried sauce noodles, Beagle pizza, Baozi yellow, happy lemon, Forrest Gump pot helmet, Kuafu Fried String, honey Snow Ice City, etc. is still noisy even during the epidemic.\n 7. High end consumption and mass consumption appear in a shopping center at the same time, which seems to be inconsistent with the uniqueness of positioning. But in Changying Tianjie, it has become intentional.\n 8. The relevant person in charge of Changying Tianjie once talked about the consumption difference before and after the epidemic. “The trend of consumer polarization is becoming more and more obvious, and fewer people buy the middle section. On the one hand, they are interested in the value preservation attribute, and the consumption of luxury goods, gold and jewelry is higher; on the other hand, they are people who pursue minimalism and love the choice of high cost performance. On the contrary, the fluctuation of high-quality brands is more obvious.”\n 9. Following this logic, in 2020, Yingtian Street will adjust its own positioning and begin to replace and adjust its brand on a large scale, so that consumers can change their scene step by step and switch their multifaceted identity in real time.\n10. The deeper reason lies in the changes of consumption circles in Changying area in recent years. Five or six years ago or even earlier, the consumer groups in Changying area were known as “third rate customers”, that is, low-income white-collar workers from other places working in Beijing and local low-income families in Beijing. While high-end brands are struggling here, “some chain brands in Beijing’s developed business district often work hard to maintain in Changying for a year and a half, and then withdraw their stores one after another. Not only the stores in large shopping malls collapsed one after another, but also some small and medium-sized merchants in the bottom business of the community changed one after another in a half year cycle”.\n11. When Changying Tianjie was just opened, some people were not optimistic about it, and the challenges faced can be imagined. However, all kinds of good news such as the opening of Beijing Metro Line 6, Tongzhou becoming the sub center of Beijing and the West extension of Metro Line 6 soon, the completion of surrounding office building clusters, the entry of media enterprises, emerging entrepreneurs, star brokerage companies and other subjects one after another, the consumer portraits in Changying area tend to be diversified, and the level is gradually rising, and the consumption gap with style needs to be filled. Therefore, the positioning of Changying Tianjie also began to experience the process from low to high.\n12. If you, like me, have personal experience of the changes of Changying Tianjie in recent years, you will have the same feeling: in the past, everything was stuffed into it, and now it is a purposeful brand upgrading; It used to be drainage, but now it’s customer service.\n13. For example, overweight new experience formats. Changying Tianjie has introduced the automobile Experience Hall, and Weilai space, Nezha automobile and ideal automobile have all settled in. It is rare to see four Starbucks stores in changyingtian street, including standard stores, take out stores and Starbucks selection stores.\n14. Catering is a good business form for major shopping centers to develop experience consumption and attract customers. At the beginning of its opening, changyingtian Street set up the largest catering area in the whole Beijing shopping center. It is understood that the catering business of 270000 square meters of Changying Tianjie accounts for nearly 1 / 3, but some brands are not tonal enough. Now in order to improve customer quality, Changying Tianjie has also made adjustments.\n15. Walking on the 4-5 floors where catering merchants are concentrated, it is no exaggeration to say that if the purpose is not strong, it is easy to pick a fancy eye. Popular catering, local cuisine, exotic cuisine, and even Michelin, black pearl and other well-known catering, such as Cuihua building, Su bangyuan, yanshe, Cai Lan and so on. Whether it’s social, business, or tasting, there’s always a choice.\n16. △ in the catering section of 4-5f in the East and west of changyingtian street, almost every house has a unique decoration style.

According to the introduction of the project team, Changying Tianjie is one of the shopping centers that maintained an adverse upgrade during the epidemic, and it is also\n18.

After four stages of basic data collection, monitoring and preliminary screening, online public voting and final evaluation, combined with public voting, big data detection results and expert opinions, this recommendation activity finally determined that 90 “reading new media numbers loved by the public” were selected, including 60 wechat official account, 15 audio numbers and 15 video numbers.\n\n▲ speech by Liu Binjie, honorary chairman of China national reading media alliance and Dean of School of Journalism and communication of Tsinghua University\n\nLiu Binjie, honorary chairman of China national reading media alliance and President of the school of Journalism and communication of Tsinghua University, congratulated the successful holding and selection of the event. He pointed out that over the years, China Press, publication and media group and China national reading media alliance have always attached great importance to the publicity and promotion of national reading and made important contributions to promoting the in-depth development of national reading. The recommendation activity of “popular reading new media number” adheres to correct orientation, high-quality content, diverse forms and strong promotion, and plays an important leading role in promoting national reading.

He said that this recommendation activity uses the new media index matrix (CMI index) independently developed by the technical team of the national reading and financial media think tank to collect big data, learn and evolve data models, track, monitor and quantitatively evaluate.

Although the progress bar in 2022 has exceeded 1 / 3, the number of 100 billion real estate enterprises is only 3, a decrease of 2 / 3 compared with the same period last year.\n\nIn fact, under the background of “no speculation in housing and housing” and reducing leverage, the most intuitive change in the industry is that the growth rate of sales scale of real estate enterprises gradually slows down. According to Kerui statistics, in 2021, nearly 40% of the top 100 real estate enterprises’ cumulative performance decreased year-on-year.\n\nWhen the industry falls into a cold winter, “maintaining stability” has become the first priority for the development of real estate enterprises.\n\nStable sales\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, a research report on Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei released by the China Index Institute pointed out that the market in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei region cooled rapidly in the second half of 2021, the market entered the adjustment period, and customers’ wait-and-see mood increased. At the end of the year, although real estate enterprises increased preferential efforts and actively marketing, the market transaction scale did not significantly improve, and the power to restore confidence in the market was insufficient.\n\nThe market environment is sluggish, and the pressure on Rongsheng development, which has heavy positions here, can be imagined. To this end, Rongsheng development timely adjusted its business strategy, controlled investment, timely reduced leverage, strengthened sales and increased the rate of payment collection.\n\nIt is understood that Rongsheng development implements the two marketing platforms of “home in Rongsheng” and “rongyitong”. On the one hand, we will continue to cultivate deeply and maintain the leading position in the market of key regions. We will maintain the first market share in Cangzhou, Bengbu, Langfang City, Sanhe, Wen’an, Xinzhou, Zhangjiajie, Hanzhong, Zouping and other regions; On the other hand, the Yangtze River Delta region continues to develop and become the main sales area of Rongsheng development.\n\nBecause of this, Rongsheng development has achieved positive growth in sales. On April 29, Rongsheng Development released its 2021 performance report. According to the financial report, in 2021, the contracted area was 12.0422 million square meters, a year-on-year increase of 2.53%; The contract amount reached 134.558 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 5.87%, and 103.51% of the annual contract plan was completed.\n\nWhen the external environment is under pressure, Rongsheng development’s performance is really hard won. According to Kerui data, the sales growth rate of large-scale real estate enterprises rarely showed negative growth in 2021, and the average target performance completion rate was less than 90%.\n\nStable finance\n\nUnder the condition of ensuring steady growth of performance, Rongsheng development is also making every effort to maintain financial stability.\n\nAccording to the data disclosed in the annual report, as of the end of 2021, the net cash flow generated by Rongsheng development’s operating activities was 16.915 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 1137.7%, realizing a positive net operating cash flow for five consecutive years. By the end of the first quarter of 2022, this figure had reached 2.27 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 145.33%.\n\nUnder the background of the continuous tightening of industry funds, Rongsheng development has been able to maintain the operating cash flow in the inflow state for many years, which has strengthened its ability to resist market risks, and can also see its management’s determination to stabilize the enterprise’s finance.\n\nMoreover, its debt structure has also been continuously optimized to a certain extent. By the end of 2021, the interest bearing liabilities of Rongsheng development were 55.491 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 24.09% compared with 73.099 billion yuan last year; The monetary capital is 19.699 billion yuan and the owner’s equity is 45.418 billion yuan.\n\nAmong them, short-term loans have been declining for many years. According to tonghuashun data, from 2018 to 2021, the short-term loans of Rongsheng development were 9.186 billion yuan, 4.125 billion yuan, 1.969 billion yuan and 813 million yuan respectively, with a year-on-year decrease of 13.75%, 55.1%, 52.26% and 58.71% respectively. By the end of the first quarter of 2022, short-term loans fell again by 66.41% year-on-year to 609 million yuan.\n\nRongsheng development said that in 2022, all work will focus on ensuring the safety of cash flow and further consolidate the foundation of financial security. On the premise of taking “Chuang” as the basic working attitude, we will reduce costs, reduce expenses and refinance. In addition, the company also proposed to ensure the delivery, quality and payment collection, pay close attention to internal management, stimulate endogenous power, squeeze water, tap potential and seek breakthroughs, so as to maintain the healthy development and stable operation of the company.\n\nSteady development\n\nFaced with multiple external environmental pressures in 2021, a group of real estate enterprises have indeed suffered a major impact. However, recently, the real estate market has been warm and positive.\n\nOn May 4, the bank, the NPC and the CPPCC and other regulatory agencies collectively issued a voice to maintain the stability and order of real estate financing; On April 29, the meeting pointed out that under the positioning of “housing without speculation”, we should support all localities to improve real estate policies based on local conditions, support rigid and improved housing demand, optimize the supervision of commercial housing pre-sale funds, and promote the steady and healthy development of the real estate market.\n\nIn fact, since this year, measures to stabilize the property market have been introduced in many cities across the country. According to the statistics of Zhongyuan Real Estate Research Institute, since this year, nearly 110 cities have issued new policies to stabilize the real estate market, including many new first tier and second tier cities such as Suzhou, Fuzhou, Zhengzhou, Foshan and Tianjin. The policy content is mainly to promote the release of rigid demand and improved demand. Among them, the number of various real estate regulation policies in the first quarter reached 157, while the number of stable real estate market policies in April (as of April 28) exceeded 60.\n\nKerui Research Center believes that the property market has been “deregulated” in many places recently, and the “recovery” of the real estate market is still expected. It is expected that the core city market is expected to reach the bottom and stabilize in the third quarter.\n\nUnder the warming of the policy side, with a balanced land layout, Rongsheng development will further stabilize the development of enterprises. It is understood that in 2021, under the basic strategy of prudent investment, it flexibly carried out investment and expansion according to the market situation, and reserved sufficient land resources in key cities such as the Bohai Sea, the Yangtze River economic belt, the Pearl River Delta and the central and western regions.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the company added 29 new land reserves, with a total construction area of 3.0319 million square meters; The amount of land purchase was 12.342 billion yuan, and the amount of equity land purchase was 8.019 billion yuan. By the end of the reporting period, the total construction area of the company’s land reserve had reached 34.689 million square meters, providing sufficient resources for development in the next few years.\n\nYihan think tank pointed out that in 2021, the real estate industry will usher in a restructuring. Sound real estate enterprises will be able to enjoy certain dividends when the market starts to pick up if there are no major mistakes or the impact of external Black Swan events.", "timestamp": 1653268628, "digest": "-un6XKU2SFxo4x9MPyWk3vqIZ-YS-mAnwIN_p3rdK2w", "contributor": "0x67e7Ce5794BDEeDCe623Ed6C33754e3c32F68aA1"}

Last week’s update showed that China’s share of mining went from 0.0% in August 2021 to … 22.3% in September 2021.\n\nClearly something is up here, so let’s dive in. While we are there, we’ll also touch on two other bitcoin mining related topics: 1) [hashprice](https://data.hashrateindex.com/network-data/btc) and 2) [mining company woes](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/04/marathon-digital-may-start-to-sell-some-of-its-bitcoins/).\n\n***You’re reading [Crypto Long & Short](https://www.coindesk.com/newsletters/crypto-long-short/), our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. [Sign up here](https://www.coindesk.com/newsletters/crypto-long-short/) to get it in your inbox every Sunday.***\n\nChina banned bitcoin mining in May 2021, and it [showed up in the data](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/13/bitcoin-mining-after-the-china-ban-us-dominance-is-set-to-continue/). By July, there were virtually no miners mining in China. None in August either. Then, in September, almost all the miners who left came back. At least, that’s what the data shows:\n\n*(Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance)*\n\nPerhaps it’s not obvious so I’ll say it: That didn’t happen. Moving mining operations isn’t [exactly easy](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/21/chinese-logistics-firm-airlifting-bitcoin-mining-machines-to-maryland-report/). The bulk of mining operations isn't a handful of hobbyists messing around; Bitcoin has long since graduated from that. Most miners are more properly characterized as commercial operations, paying [triple net leases](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triple-net-lease-nnn.asp) for warehouse space and depending on fancy [power purchase agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_purchase_agreement) for electricity.\n\nBitcoin mining operations look like this (check out this [amazing photojournalism](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/miningweek/2022/03/21/what-does-a-crypto-mining-farm-look-like-striking-photos-from-siberia-to-spain/) effort from my colleagues):\n\n*(Sandali Handagama/CoinDesk)*\n\nThe reason the data looks like this is due to the [data collection method](https://ccaf.io/cbeci/mining_map/methodology) employed by the CCAF. The CCAF partnered with [bitcoin mining pools](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-bitcoin-mining-pools/) to collect geolocational mining facility data based on IP addresses (pools allow a lot of different miners to contribute to mining, and the reward is then split among them according to their processing contribution to smooth out individual miner income). Therein lies the issue and the CCAF warns as much, stating:\n\n*It is no secret in the industry that \\[miners\\] in certain locations use virtual private networks (VPNs) or proxy services to hide their IP addresses in order to obfuscate their location. Such behaviour may distort the sample and result in an overestimation (or underestimation) of hashrate in some provinces or countries.*\n\nSo the real story of what I think happened here is actually quite boring.\n\n1. Chinese miners were afraid that the government crackdown was serious, so they lied or spoofed their location data and moved underground.\n2. After some time, Chinese miners realized, “Hey, this doesn’t seem that scary,” so they felt comfortable sharing their real data.\n\nThat’s it. Like I suggested: actually quite boring.\n\nThat’s not really the whole truth though. The more visible bitcoin mining operators did move at least part of their operations, and the growth of non-China, mostly U.S.-located mining is well documented. To highlight that, hashrate – the computational power of the Bitcoin network – has grown 40% since the China ban. The CCAF, recognizing the oddity of the data, published a [wonderfully titled blog post](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/insight/2022/bitcoin-mining-new-data-reveal-a-surprising-resurgence/) about their update leaving us with this:\n\n*Most notably, however, is China’s apparent comeback. Following the government ban in June 2021, reported hashrate for the entire country effectively plummeted to zero during the months of July and August. Yet reported hashrate suddenly surged back to 30.47 EH/s in September 2021, instantly catapulting China to second place globally in terms of installed mining capacity (22.29% of total market). This strongly suggests that significant underground mining activity has formed in the country, which empirically confirms what industry insiders have long been assuming.*\n\n \n \n\nThe operative word here being “reported.” So yeah, it turns out that China can [in fact ban bitcoin mining again](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/china-crypto-bans-a-complete-history/). Here’s to more [China FUD](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/fud/) (fear, uncertainty, doubt) in our future. Alternatively, maybe everyone is messing with us and using VPNs to change their location to China to make my job difficult.\n\n## Hashprice and mining company woes\n\nAmid falling bitcoin prices, there is also some concern around bitcoin miners and their profitability. There is a [metric developed by Luxor Technologies](https://data.hashrateindex.com/chart/bitcoin-hashprice-index) called hashprice which represents the expected value of mining. Hashprice is expressed as a dollar per terahash per day, a terahash being the computational power provided by mining equipment. Here is how the last month has fared for hashprice.\n\n*(CoinDesk Research, Hashrate Index, Luxor Technologies)*\n\nHashprice has trended down due to 1) the USD price of bitcoin falling, 2) more miners coming online and 3) the subsequent increased [network difficulty](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-everything-you-need-to-know/) (the network adjusts how hard it is to mine roughly every two weeks, based on the amount of active mining power). Not exactly rosy, but it makes sense. And the decline is acting as a forcing function for mining operators to buckle down or shut down. Many industry practitioners are warning that this is the time when “only the strong will survive.”\n\nIn theory, miners turn off their machines whenever bitcoin prices drop significantly, and it becomes unprofitable to keep them running. This time, even though hashprice has decreased, we haven’t seen this sort of drop off, and we have the public mining company filings to prove it. Public miners have all publicly repped to something along the lines of, “We are mining bitcoin, we want to mine more bitcoin, we are going to hold as much of the bitcoin we mine as possible and we’re going to use other sources of capital to fund operations and growth.”\n\nThat could be fine, but as these miners feel more pressure, there are potential obligations to capital providers they might have to answer to. On top of that, if the market gets worse, these companies may need to do something, like [start selling their bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/04/marathon-digital-may-start-to-sell-some-of-its-bitcoins/). These aren’t companies with the balance sheets of Apple or Google; they more closely resemble startups that happen to trade on the public markets.\n\nAll said, there is no particular reason to worry about the mining industry as a whole. Bitcoin mining will be fine, but the cast of characters might change since the capital markets are available up until the moment they aren’t. Bitcoin will be better for it, but there might be some pain coming at the company level.\n\n\n---\n\n#### Read more about\n\n[China](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/china/)[Mining](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/mining/)[Hashrate](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/hashrate/)[Bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/bitcoin/)[Crypto Long & Short](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/crypto-long-short/)\n\nThe Festival for the Decentralized World\n\nThursday - Sunday, June 9-12, 2022\n\nAustin, Texas\n\n[Save a Seat Now](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus2022/)\n\nDISCLOSURE\n\n*Please note that our [privacy policy](https://www.coindesk.com/privacy/), [terms of use](https://www.coindesk.com/terms/), [cookies](https://www.coindesk.com/privacy/#cookies), and [do not sell my personal information](https://www.coindesk.com/privacy/#dnsmpi) has been updated. \n  \n The leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a [strict set of editorial policies](https://www.coindesk.com/ethics/).

Dune链上数据分析\n\n最近一周我遇到了比较郁闷的事情，我一直用来做链上可视化监控的平台Dune，数据基本不更新了，我和Levi大佬的代码就放在那么，但是他的数据库里面的大多数数据只更新到了14号，要知道最近每天的数据都比较关键，对于判断用户增长和燃烧很有用。\n\n我有尝试使用Footprint，虽然他们看起来想做的方向和愿景不错，但是还处于相对早期的阶段，暂时数据也不很完善。已经第一时间向他们的技术人员反馈，周一希望能够得到及时的跟进。\n\n目前我只能使用bscscan做一些相对粗略的分析了。\n\n# 数据分析总结\n\n昨天的AMA，Jerry虽然上台回答了一些问题，但是主要有用的，只是释放了一些对经济感到满意的信号，实际没太多准确的信息。大多数消息还是同前一天的英文AMA。\n\n昨天BSC的鞋价和GST价格相比与前一天变化不大，mint和打金还是处在相当暴利的阶段。目前使用较高效的组合打金的回本周期在15-16天左右，mint利润远高于mint成本，灰鞋mint利润税后约11bnb，绿鞋约30bnb。\n\n\n---\n\n### bscscan数据\n\n今天着重分析下bscscan的数据（所有的这些数据都有1天延迟）：\n\n![GST](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OoML8lprRkaBzIux3q4z_.png?height=605&width=1383&size=large)\n\n上图是GST在STEPN主账户地址的转账情况，可以看到在约4-5天前的样子，每日receive address的数量超过sent address数量，差不多与此同时inbound超过outbound transfer数量。也就是，在之前转出操作更多，但最近几天，转入操作更多。\n\n转出GST的操作是偏打金者的行为，转入操作是mint燃烧大于打金产出（或者纯mint不打金）的行为。也就是说最近几天的mint数量明显增加，但打金者的数量却没有明显跟进。这带来的可能会是，gst产出相对mint的燃烧会显得不足，这也部分解释了gst价格推高的原因。如果之后的转入转出的差距越来越大，或许gst会进一步上涨。\n\n当然，这种分析非常粗糙，我从图上没办法得到实际的数值差距，只能看到转账次数和账户数。\n\n![GMT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UU-S6H7I3CC1ma3ZR9gyi.png?height=604&width=1374&size=large)\n\n上图是GMT在STEPN主账户地址的转账情况，由于目前gmt主要用于mint和升级，但是没有产生gmt的渠道，所以可以忽略转出操作。\n\n可以看到每日转入地址数和笔数在同比例增长，且最近增幅加快。\n\n结合GST和GMT的曲线，很明显能过得出最近涌入BSC用户开始快速增加，且mint量也在快速提高。\n\n\n---\n\n如果问最近能不能入场mint，我之前几天觉得可以，当时还没有fomo起来，2天生一胎卖了也能回一小半了。但是，现在由于很多想要的数据不全，我也不好下判断了。\n\n如果问能不能入场打金，我觉得暂时按最优组合是OK的，GST的价格盘在10u以上应该会再有不短的一段时间，即使之后价格缓慢降下去，无非就是把回本时间从15天延长到20天25天，依然算是比较划算的。\n\n最后，DYOR，量力而行，不要FOMO。\n\n### 新手入门及进阶指南，可以看这篇：\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0xpineapple.eth/pbkbofqLkTMkf6oPQ-aCunZS0QI6TKBCW1wXdYX5o80](https://mirror.xyz/0xpineapple.eth/pbkbofqLkTMkf6oPQ-aCunZS0QI6TKBCW1wXdYX5o80)\n\n\n---\n\n## 运动收益及回本周期计算\n\n### SOL链\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8QxJsL1YYpCLmZ2biAWMQ.png?height=359&width=1253&size=large)\n\n### BSC链\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/29xWpv0E40qoWjOw6JAIU.png?height=360&width=1267&size=large)\n\n## 宝石合成收益分析\n\n根据实时数据和地板价计算，价格波动较大，可能会影响数据准确度。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BUXWZtVpuC1Tx1WgeZ8FC.png?height=408&width=1020&size=medium)\n\n## 期末mint收益计算及总日回报率计算\n\n### SOL链\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/u49CCsRlmuliy_ZBUYNOd.png?height=275&width=556)\n\n### BSC链\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4HGganshkIUUaQEn-MP_F.png?height=274&width=553)\n\n## 单组鞋mint成本分析\n\n### SOL链\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PQ7k-fDbTAmQwKuW_LziA.png?height=488&width=896&size=large)\n\n### BSC链\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4VSpHoC5YO9Pyf5bjtb6g.png?height=460&width=895&size=large)\n\n## 开鞋盒数学期望及开盒策略\n\n### SOL链\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/axXlgp3OTk2nL4OD_HeFQ.png?height=688&width=580)\n\n### BSC链\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/B0IdOCr1LAJm0dBhx20j-.png?height=640&width=574)\n\n## Dune链上数据分析\n\n上面的图表可以去[这里查看](https://dune.com/0xpineapple/StepN)\n\nSOL链新增和日活连续多天保持较高水平。\n\n可能是由于更多的用户涌入BSC链，昨天SOL链新增用户略低。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D9QJJOqdtjCMXAm7Prdss.png?height=798&width=948)\n\n下面的表格来自[Levi](https://dune.com/levilin2008/LeviLin_Stepn_Analysis)，感谢\n\n昨天项目方又进行了一次手续费的提取，导致SOL出金略大于入金，除去该笔金额，实际玩家行为的入金依旧大于出金。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9ahM1b06eT3lM8kDCxvFl.png?height=813&width=1058)\n\n\n---\n\n关于经济模型分析：\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0xpineapple.eth/Mrb0Yzj4DK0g_xQzaevKqMQ7YkrWDOVNZyjzyep7csQ](https://mirror.xyz/0xpineapple.eth/Mrb0Yzj4DK0g_xQzaevKqMQ7YkrWDOVNZyjzyep7csQ)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0xpineapple.eth/Zi--l4Tb1XqWaCXzrpA9zZEpCgKu0T7N3NZ_LI48KjQ](https://mirror.xyz/0xpineapple.eth/Zi--l4Tb1XqWaCXzrpA9zZEpCgKu0T7N3NZ_LI48KjQ)\n\n\n---\n\n**欢迎感兴趣的朋友关注我的Twitter，我会每日更新笔记：**\n\n[https://twitter.com/0xBigPineapple](https://twitter.com/0xBigPineapple)\n\n### 【声明：本文及相关系列文章不作为投资建议，商用引用前请联系作者Twitter获得许可，非商业引用请规范引用，注明出处】", "timestamp": 1653269482, "digest": "6S7g0rSnQ7PRXFRwaxc4uc9X8Jf4-vzVFd4PaUE8vrM", "contributor": "0xA4089ED3282b9A35A3295E745cEc3d1fFb5c82C3"}

前言**\n前段时间luna崩盘，连带着带崩大盘，也严重打击了市场对于算稳的信心，连带着fxs、FEI等其他算稳币也一并受到牵连。具体luna崩盘过程已经有太多人分析，在此不再赘述。归根到底，对于抵押型稳定币而言，其死穴就是抵押物价值（luna可变现市值）不足以支撑货币规模（ust市值规模），进而引发市场恐慌，如果没有好的机制阻止挤兑，结局就是luna这样。\n那么如果同样的情况bean遇到了，bean能否防止被挤兑，以及靠什么机制来阻止挤兑？bean这种“信用货币”能否走出另外一条路来？\n这篇文章主要是借luna的事情探讨下bean在恐慌的情况下是如何防止挤兑的，不过由于bean还没重新上线，这次的文章更多的是一个“思想实验”，或者说一种理论推演，真实情况如何目前无法预知。\n这篇文章需要读者对bean的机制有一定了解，不太了解的朋友建议读一下系列文章的01和02篇，对bean的机制有一个初步认识。\n**1 beanstalk的三道防线** 这部分根据beanstalk创始人Publius的访谈，和自己的理解整合而成。Publish在访谈中谈到的一个观点我很认可，“***任何一个算稳系统都无法避免挤兑的发生，但关键在于挤兑的过程中如何阻止人们过度恐慌抛售以及吸引新的买盘进来***”。\nBeanstalk在防止挤兑这方面主要依托自身的机制设计，我称之为beanstalk的三道防线--分别是convert功能、stalk销毁机制以及pod机制。\n**1.1 convert功能--第一道防线**\nConvert功能是一种套利功能。在bean价格高于$1时，投资者可以选择将手上的bean换成LP，因为bean最终还是会回到$1，这么做相当于高价卖掉一部分bean换成了ETH/LUSD等其他资产；而当价格低于$1时，可以将LP换成bean，这就相当于把LP中的ETH/LUSD等资产卖掉买bean，而当bean又会到$1时这就相当于你低价抄底了一部分bean。\nConvert功能对于bean的价格稳定有很大作用，激励投资者围绕$1来回套利。\n自然在bean价格低于$1的时候，想要套利的投资者将ETH/LUSD等“真金白银”换成bean，是可以起到阻止币价下跌作用的。但这道防线的“防护程度”随着bean价格下跌而逐渐减弱，因为bean价格下来你手上LP里的ETH/LUSD等本身就会不断自动的换成bean，所以这道防线更适用平抑于bean价格的日常波动（例如0.9\\~1.1这个区间）。\n**1.2 stalk销毁机制--第二道防线**\n如果一个投资者想要从系统中提现，那么他之前积累的stalk将会被销毁，而stalk代表了bean系统的分红权和治理权。该投资者的提现行为会导致留在系统中的其他投资者stalk份额的上升（相当于其他投资者的分子没变，但分母减少了），从而使得其他投资者留在系统中的动力变大。\n举例来说，比如挤兑发生前，你持有的stalk仅占系统总stalk的1%，但此时挤兑发生了，大部分人都跑了导致系统中stalk总数的90%被销毁，而如果你不跑，你stalk的份额就能占到1%/（1-90%）=10%。相当于你从一个1%的小股东一跃成为10%的大股东。\n那么这个机制的设计，就会使得投资者对系统的粘性更强。而在挤兑发生时，先跑的人虽然更安全，但后跑的人能收获更高的stalk占比，所以后跑的人就会权衡下风险和收益，显然留在最后的人收益是最高的（极端情况下别人跑光了就剩你一个，你就是100%的股东，但这个肯定不会发生，只是为了便于理解）。那么在实际博弈中，当挤兑到一定程度时可能有一些人就不想跑了，因为收益足够高。所以这个机制可以一定程度阻止人们的恐慌抛售。\n这里对于下ust的机制，因为不论ust的规模多少anchor的利率都是20%（后改为动态利率），那么就意味着如果发生挤兑，先跑的人安全，而后跑的人除了风险更高之外并不会有任何收益，所以大家干嘛不先跑，就算我贪图那20个点年华我完全可以等安全了再回来。这样在后跑的人没有任何收益的情况下，挤兑时必然就是比谁跑得快。\n所以我推测，如果ust定一个总的利息收益池，跟ust规模呈反比，那么跑的人越多剩下的人能分到利息越高，后跑的人也有收益，如此一来应该会比固定利率的机制鲁棒性更强。\n***第二道防线归根到底就是，挤兑发生时，随着先跑的人越来越多，要让后跑的人收益也越来越高。这样先跑的人虽然安全，风险低，但后跑的人有更高收益，完全符合风险和收益对等的原则。这样市场就会自动博弈出来一个均衡点，在这个均衡点后剩下的人不愿意再抛售，从而限制无限抛售的发生。***\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n**1.3 pod机制--第三道防线**\n第三道防线是beanstalk整个系统中的核心部分，也是beanstalk“信用货币”的根基。这个就是beanstalk的最大创新之一--pod机制。\nbean在低于$1时，bean发行pods（债券）的数量和利率（weather）均会上升，而pods则意味着系统向外借债购买bean，买回来的bean会被销毁从而退出流通，以缩减bean的总供应促使bean回到$1。\n而当bean脱锚越厉害，pods吸引力越高。试想下这样的场景，如果bean在1$时你购买了利率为500%的pods，pods到期时你能赚5x；如果bean一下次跌到了0.2$，此时同样的利率你能赚1/0.2\\*500%=25X（假设pods到期后bean价格又回到了1）。因此，bean的脱锚，使得相同利率的债务更加便宜，那么就会吸引更多的人前来购买，这就是bean的第三道防线。\n**2 beanstalk的机制无懈可击吗？**\n这三道防线的保护，看起来使得bean的机制鲁棒性更强，但bean是不是真的无懈可击呢？Bean的死穴又在哪里？\n在我看来，目前bean的死穴主要有两个--债务水平过高和治理机制过于去中心化。\n**2.1 债务水平过高**\n对于bean来说，第三道防线pods机制是整个体系维持bean价格稳定的重要组成部分，然而有一种可能是，当系统累积的债务pods过高，极端情况下（比如bean还清债务要100年）那么即便系统给出再高的利率也没有人愿意来接盘。\n所以在bean被攻击前，团队已经在降低pod rate（pods总数/bean的规模），在逐渐降低系统的债务水平，因此这个问题并非无解，只要把系统的债务水平控制在合理水平即可。\n**2.2 治理机制的漏洞**\n这次bean被攻击，很大程度就是因为治理机制被黑客利用，黑客短期间积累了大量的stalk从而发起了对自己有利的提案，短时间提案迅速通过从而把池子里的钱偷走。这是一次典型的治理攻击。所以目前团队暂时收回了社区发起提案的权利。\n而在未来，按照团队的设想，stalk将可以交易。那么同样的问题还会存在，很可能攻击者会在二级市场上积累大量的stalk，从而发起不利于整体系统的提案，比如攻击者可以发一个shitcoin，然后利用手里的stalk份额同意组一个shitcoin/bean的池子，从而掏空bean其他池子的“真金白银”。\n所以在未来，团队对于治理机制还是需要进一步改进的。如果谁持有stalk多谁说了算，那么很可能这个治理机制就会被攻击者利用。\n这里也引发一个思考，所谓的去中心化治理，完全按照治理代币的份额多少决定投票权，是否合理？是不是很可能变成了巨鲸翻云覆雨的游戏？\n**2.3 其他漏洞**\nBean后续会上线更多功能比如所有池子间的convert功能、stalk的奖励系统以及bean为媒介的dex等等，所以合约代码是否会有漏洞也是一个未知数。\n而如果在未来，bean规模到了一定程度，一定会被各种各样的资金盯上，想要做空的、想要黑掉bean的，所以有一点漏洞就会被人利用，这对于bean将会是一个考验。当然，经历过各种考验的项目，才能证明是可以穿越牛熊的项目。\n**3 luna崩掉之后的算稳格局**\n在当下这个熊市行情下，luna崩盘使得大家对算稳的信心更加不足。尤其对fxs打击更大，因为fxs虽然是抵押比例是动态的，但最终目的还是想变成0usdc抵押，本质上和luna是一致的，所以luna的失败对于fxs这类抵押型算稳打击巨大。\n其他还存活的算稳，ohm（严格来说不算算稳）、fei等也都不温不火，ohm靠着inverse bond在大跌中还算坚挺，但重回巅峰在可预见的时间内比较困难。\n所以算稳这个版块近期内比较值得期待的也就是bean了，看看bean的这个机制能否开辟出另外一条路来。\n**4 币圈到底需不需要算法稳定币？**\n一直有一种说法是算稳是整个币圈的圣杯，然而luna这次崩盘直接导致很多人开始质疑究竟币圈是否需要一个算法稳定币？或者说算法稳定币是不是就是一个伪需求，一个披着革新外衣的ponzi？\n稳定币毫无疑问都是币圈的重要基础设施，目前稳定币版块也基本都被中心化稳定币-usdt、busd（币安扶持）、usdc等等所垄断。上述中心化稳定币价格相对稳定，安全性相对有保障（目前还未出现过暴雷的问题），那么既然如此，为什么我们还需要一个算法稳定币？\n在我看来区块链最重要的一个优势就是去中心化，所谓去中心化在我看来还有一层内涵就是把原来中心化机构的利益拿出一部分来给系统的持有者。比如94之后币安发行了自己的平台币，拿自己利润来回购bnb外加ieo各种赋能，而在此之前无论交易所如何赚钱跟散户也是没关系的，随后火币、ok等纷纷跟风发行平台币。诚然币安做成第一有很多其他原因，但我觉得依托BNB让利给平台使用者是个很重要的原因。再比如张建的FT，依靠交易挖矿其交易额一度超过币安，虽然最后失败了，但这个模式不也是开创了各类dex交易挖矿的先河吗？\n***所以我认为，区块链技术本身就是要颠覆原有的生产关系，把中心化机构垄断的利益拿出一部来分给散户，分给所有参与者。这本身就代表了更为先进的一种生产关系。\n那么对于稳定币而言，usdt/usdc/BUSD这些中心化稳定币规模再大，再赚钱，也跟散户没什么关系。那么如果存在一个算法稳定币系统，能够保持自身稳定的同时，让度一部分系统的收益给所有愿意为给系统做贡献的参与者，这难道不是更为先进的进化方向吗？***\n所以我认为未来一定会有一个算法稳定币出现，成为币圈不可或缺的重要基础设施。\n在我看来，bean目前初步具备这个雏形，bean向所有人开放，只要你愿意参与，无论是组LP抑或是买pods，你都可以享受bean整个系统增发的收益。\n**5 写在最后**\n不论如何，luna的崩盘再次提醒了大家风险要放在第一位，除了BTC/ETH其他任何币都不值得重仓。\nbean距离成功还有好远的路要走，也有极大的归零概率。但跟踪这个过程并提高自己的认知，才是最重要的。", "timestamp": 1653269363, "digest": "xHeEkr3IG4csuJWyHwIHHS1QrnZYGnnJsVeEmnvCjng",

Wang Jianjun, member of the Party group of the National Health Commission, executive deputy director of the national Aging office and President of China Aging Association, Guo Yiqiang, Deputy Secretary General of the Central Propaganda Department, Wu Shulin, President of China Publishing Association, Wu Shangzhi, President of China periodical association, and others attended the Forum.\n\nThe first national reading conference · Yinling reading sub Forum (photo provided by the organizer)\n\nWang Jianjun pointed out that the “silver age reading sub forum”, as an important part of the first national reading conference, fully reflects the high attention to the spiritual and cultural life of the elderly and conveys the cordial care for the elderly readers. The active participation of the majority of the elderly in the construction of “Book fragrance” in China is inseparable. To promote reading for the elderly, we should focus on strengthening political guidance, meeting the needs of the elderly and promoting the development of human resources for the elderly. He believes that learning is the best pension, and reading is the most effective and convenient learning. Reading makes the life of the elderly richer, richer and more wonderful, and plays a greater role in the construction of a modern socialist power.\n\nGuo Yiqiang pointed out that guiding the elderly to build a positive and healthy outlook on aging puts forward clear requirements for the majority of publishers and reading promoters - that is, how to enable the elderly to learn and contribute to the society through the production and reading of excellent cultural products, and use “scholarly fragrance” to accompany the elderly to enjoy a happy old age. He called for increasing the publicity and promotion of “recommending excellent publications to the national elderly in 2021” to let the elderly readers know what good books are optional and readable. He suggested that publishing enterprises should create more readable, targeted and practical excellent publications on the premise of meeting the diversified and personalized reading and learning needs of the elderly. At the same time, through the barrier free transformation of digital publications, we can improve the contact rate and utilization rate of digital reading for the elderly, and help the elderly cross the “digital divide” of reading.\n\nWu Shulin pointed out that high-quality reading for the elderly is of great significance and promising. Reading for the elderly is an important part of national reading and an important field that needs the attention, care and guidance of the whole society. He mobilized the selected publishing house to donate “silver age bookshelves” to villages (houses) in 100 key areas of national rural revitalization, so as to enrich the spiritual and cultural life of the grass-roots elderly through reading.\n\nWu Shangzhi analyzed the need for improvement and perfection in the current reading services for the elderly, and put forward suggestions on further promoting reading for the elderly from four aspects: providing more excellent reading materials for the elderly, improving reading facilities and services for the elderly, strengthening reading promotion for the elderly and increasing policy support for reading materials for the elderly.\n\n100 excellent publications\n\nCovering many areas of life for the elderly\n\nIn the release session of the forum, Wang Jianjun, Guo Yiqiang, Wu Shulin, Wu Shangzhi, Wang Shaozhong, member of the Party group of the national Aging office and vice president of China Aging Association, and Ma guocang, chairman of China Press, publication and media group, announced the bibliography of “recommending excellent publications to the national elderly in 2021”.\n\nIn 2021, a booth for recommending 100 kinds of excellent publications to the national elderly (photos provided by the organizer)\n\nSponsored by the office of the National Working Committee on aging, China Aging Association and China Publishing Association, the “activity of recommending excellent publications to the national elderly in 2021” has been launched since October 2021. A total of 1380 publications have been declared by 363 publishing units across the country, the largest number of previous evaluations. After several rounds of review by experts, scholars and elderly reading promoters, a total of 100 excellent publications were selected, including 36 kinds of Humanities and history, 30 kinds of literature and art, 19 kinds of health care and 15 kinds of life, leisure and other categories.\n\n1937, Yan’an dialogue, written by Thomas Arthur bison, translated by Li Yan, people’s Literature Publishing House, June 2021 (recommended bibliography of the activity of recommending excellent publications to the national elderly in 2021)\n\nIt is understood that 100 excellent publications cover many fields of elderly life, such as medicine, food, housing, transportation, use, learning and entertainment. They pay special attention to the new needs and expectations of the elderly in social development and changes, such as digital intelligent life, establishing a positive outlook on aging and aging Finance. At the same time, a number of key books showing the magnificent development process of the party in the past century have been specially selected to help elderly readers deeply study the party history and inherit the great party building spirit.\n\nIt is particularly worth mentioning that since its launch in 2014, the “activity of recommending excellent publications to the national elderly” has recommended hundreds of excellent publications with distinctive themes, rich contents, diverse themes and close to the life and needs of the elderly, which are deeply welcomed by the elderly readers. In the next step, the activity of recommending excellent publications to the national elderly in 2021 will also carry out a series of related activities such as publicity and promotion, book donation and the construction of silver age bookshelves, so as to create a scholarly life atmosphere for more elderly people.\n\nForty degrees north latitude, written by Chen Fumin, Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House, August 2021 (recommended bibliography for the activity of recommending excellent publications to the national elderly in 2021)\n\nMigu reading and Dangdang launched the digital reading and book purchase topic of “recommending excellent publications to the national elderly in 2021”, and wechat reading also launched the “elderly reading list” simultaneously.\n\nReading is a way to actively provide for the aged\n\nDiao Haifeng, executive vice president of China Association of universities for the aged, and Wang Liming, vice president and Secretary General of China Publishing Association, respectively shared themes around reading promotion and education for the aged.\n\nDiao Haifeng said that for the majority of the elderly, reading is a way to actively provide for the elderly. Reading for the elderly can not only enrich the connotation of providing for the elderly, improve the effect of providing for the elderly, expand the forms of providing for the elderly, but also develop the ability of providing for the elderly and improve the quality of providing for the elderly. To this end, he put forward six suggestions: first, focus on cultivating a positive outlook on aging; The second is to create a number of excellent reading works for the elderly; Third, focus on developing the reading guidance function of school education for the elderly; Fourth, do a good job in the aging transformation of public reading space; Fifth, we should support the elderly to study and read independently; Sixth, we should develop mixed age learning and reading.\n\nIn circle", "timestamp": 1653268817, "digest": "m_kbriGbVv6cbH9KGBvH4I_Fm8f-bkxw4Mruz49eAio", "contributor": "0x2fCdb224c35D82c7eF6F4E78b590a5af540F47e9"}

Last week’s update showed that China’s share of mining went from 0.0% in August 2021 to … 22.3% in September 2021.\n\nClearly something is up here, so let’s dive in. While we are there, we’ll also touch on two other bitcoin mining related topics: 1) [hashprice](https://data.hashrateindex.com/network-data/btc) and 2) [mining company woes](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/04/marathon-digital-may-start-to-sell-some-of-its-bitcoins/).\n\n***You’re reading [Crypto Long & Short](https://www.coindesk.com/newsletters/crypto-long-short/), our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. [Sign up here](https://www.coindesk.com/newsletters/crypto-long-short/) to get it in your inbox every Sunday.***\n\nChina banned bitcoin mining in May 2021, and it [showed up in the data](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/13/bitcoin-mining-after-the-china-ban-us-dominance-is-set-to-continue/). By July, there were virtually no miners mining in China. None in August either. Then, in September, almost all the miners who left came back. At least, that’s what the data shows:\n\n*(Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance)*\n\nPerhaps it’s not obvious so I’ll say it: That didn’t happen. Moving mining operations isn’t [exactly easy](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/21/chinese-logistics-firm-airlifting-bitcoin-mining-machines-to-maryland-report/). The bulk of mining operations isn't a handful of hobbyists messing around; Bitcoin has long since graduated from that. Most miners are more properly characterized as commercial operations, paying [triple net leases](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triple-net-lease-nnn.asp) for warehouse space and depending on fancy [power purchase agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_purchase_agreement) for electricity.\n\nBitcoin mining operations look like this (check out this [amazing photojournalism](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/miningweek/2022/03/21/what-does-a-crypto-mining-farm-look-like-striking-photos-from-siberia-to-spain/) effort from my colleagues):\n\n*(Sandali Handagama/CoinDesk)*\n\nThe reason the data looks like this is due to the [data collection method](https://ccaf.io/cbeci/mining_map/methodology) employed by the CCAF. The CCAF partnered with [bitcoin mining pools](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-bitcoin-mining-pools/) to collect geolocational mining facility data based on IP addresses (pools allow a lot of different miners to contribute to mining, and the reward is then split among them according to their processing contribution to smooth out individual miner income). Therein lies the issue and the CCAF warns as much, stating:\n\n*It is no secret in the industry that \\[miners\\] in certain locations use virtual private networks (VPNs) or proxy services to hide their IP addresses in order to obfuscate their location. Such behaviour may distort the sample and result in an overestimation (or underestimation) of hashrate in some provinces or countries.*\n\nSo the real story of what I think happened here is actually quite boring.\n\n1. Chinese miners were afraid that the government crackdown was serious, so they lied or spoofed their location data and moved underground.\n2. After some time, Chinese miners realized, “Hey, this doesn’t seem that scary,” so they felt comfortable sharing their real data.\n\nThat’s it. Like I suggested: actually quite boring.\n\nThat’s not really the whole truth though. The more visible bitcoin mining operators did move at least part of their operations, and the growth of non-China, mostly U.S.-located mining is well documented. To highlight that, hashrate – the computational power of the Bitcoin network – has grown 40% since the China ban. The CCAF, recognizing the oddity of the data, published a [wonderfully titled blog post](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/insight/2022/bitcoin-mining-new-data-reveal-a-surprising-resurgence/) about their update leaving us with this:\n\n*Most notably, however, is China’s apparent comeback. Following the government ban in June 2021, reported hashrate for the entire country effectively plummeted to zero during the months of July and August. Yet reported hashrate suddenly surged back to 30.47 EH/s in September 2021, instantly catapulting China to second place globally in terms of installed mining capacity (22.29% of total market). This strongly suggests that significant underground mining activity has formed in the country, which empirically confirms what industry insiders have long been assuming.*\n\n \n \n\nThe operative word here being “reported.” So yeah, it turns out that China can [in fact ban bitcoin mining again](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/china-crypto-bans-a-complete-history/). Here’s to more [China FUD](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/fud/) (fear, uncertainty, doubt) in our future. Alternatively, maybe everyone is messing with us and using VPNs to change their location to China to make my job difficult.\n\n## Hashprice and mining company woes\n\nAmid falling bitcoin prices, there is also some concern around bitcoin miners and their profitability. There is a [metric developed by Luxor Technologies](https://data.hashrateindex.com/chart/bitcoin-hashprice-index) called hashprice which represents the expected value of mining. Hashprice is expressed as a dollar per terahash per day, a terahash being the computational power provided by mining equipment. Here is how the last month has fared for hashprice.\n\n*(CoinDesk Research, Hashrate Index, Luxor Technologies)*\n\nHashprice has trended down due to 1) the USD price of bitcoin falling, 2) more miners coming online and 3) the subsequent increased [network difficulty](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-everything-you-need-to-know/) (the network adjusts how hard it is to mine roughly every two weeks, based on the amount of active mining power). Not exactly rosy, but it makes sense. And the decline is acting as a forcing function for mining operators to buckle down or shut down. Many industry practitioners are warning that this is the time when “only the strong will survive.”\n\nIn theory, miners turn off their machines whenever bitcoin prices drop significantly, and it becomes unprofitable to keep them running. This time, even though hashprice has decreased, we haven’t seen this sort of drop off, and we have the public mining company filings to prove it. Public miners have all publicly repped to something along the lines of, “We are mining bitcoin, we want to mine more bitcoin, we are going to hold as much of the bitcoin we mine as possible and we’re going to use other sources of capital to fund operations and growth.”\n\nThat could be fine, but as these miners feel more pressure, there are potential obligations to capital providers they might have to answer to. On top of that, if the market gets worse, these companies may need to do something, like [start selling their bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/04/marathon-digital-may-start-to-sell-some-of-its-bitcoins/). These aren’t companies with the balance sheets of Apple or Google; they more closely resemble startups that happen to trade on the public markets.\n\nAll said, there is no particular reason to worry about the mining industry as a whole. Bitcoin mining will be fine, but the cast of characters might change since the capital markets are available up until the moment they aren’t. Bitcoin will be better for it, but there might be some pain coming at the company level.\n\n\n---\n\n#### Read more about\n\n[China](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/china/)[Mining](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/mining/)[Hashrate](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/hashrate/)[Bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/bitcoin/)[Crypto Long & Short](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/crypto-long-short/)\n\nThe Festival for the Decentralized World\n\nThursday - Sunday, June 9-12, 2022\n\nAustin, Texas\n\n[Save a Seat Now](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus2022/)\n\nDISCLOSURE\n\n*Please note that our [privacy policy](https://www.coindesk.com/privacy/), [terms of use](https://www.coindesk.com/terms/), [cookies](https://www.coindesk.com/privacy/#cookies), and [do not sell my personal information](https://www.coindesk.com/privacy/#dnsmpi) has been updated. \n  \n The leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a [strict set of editorial policies](https://www.coindesk.com/ethics/).

{"id": "M1Ive1-tAuxk72Madtp4aiCkVCfO_SUGx_zVP0xk34I", "title": "卡夫卡的12条人生感悟", "body": "　坚持吐露真言 \n 　　 \n 　　虽然卡夫卡是一位以创作虚构小说而闻名于世的作家，但在现实生活中他却是一个非常真实的人。据他最好的朋友马克斯·布洛德所说，“绝对真诚”是卡夫卡之所以成为卡夫卡的一个至关重要的性格特征。这一点在某种程度上也从他的小说中反映出来：许多角色都会遇到诚实这一难以逾越的关口；或是正好相反，他们说出了真相却被人们当作谎言，从而使自己陷入困境之中。 \n 　　 \n 　　卡夫卡告诉我们：在一个不诚实的世界里做一个诚实的人，这样的人生会是非常艰难的。 \n 　　 \n 　　人生充满坎坷和艰辛 \n 　　 \n 　　卡夫卡短暂的一生经历了超乎寻常的坎坷和艰辛：与父亲的关系一直复杂而紧张；作为一名犹太人生活在奥匈帝国时期的布拉格，饱受压迫和排挤；一生都没有得到他内心向往的那种浪漫持久的情感；在还没有医治方法的年代感染了肺结核疾病…… \n 　　 \n 　　在写作过程中，卡夫卡把这种种人生经历和体验都诉诸了笔端。他通过自己的作品反复告诫人们：人生不可能一帆风顺，生命之路总是充满各种羁绊和坎坷。 \n 　　 \n 　　好朋友知你最深 \n 　　 \n 　　马克斯·布洛德是卡夫卡的终生挚友，两人的友谊从法学院读书时起就开始了。他们都热爱写作，都积极参与一个他们在布拉格创立的作家小组的活动，彼此间经常就写作交流想法和分享创意。不过后来布洛德出于为卡夫卡着想而违背了卡夫卡最后的遗愿。当卡夫卡因罹患肺结核不久于人世时，他委托布洛德在自己死后将所有文稿焚毁。因为认识到这位挚友举世无双的写作才华，布洛德没有按照卡夫卡的遗愿去做，而是将他的全部文稿整理出来并且出版。 \n 　　 \n 　　做到精确严谨 \n 　　 \n 　　精确和严谨是卡夫卡留给马克斯·布洛德印象深刻的个性品质。卡夫卡对身边的人和事物感受真切，观察细致入微，在回顾记述时又能做到精确严谨，正是这种个性特征使得他成了一个卓尔不群的作家。他不仅善于捕捉一般人通常会忽略的人类性格的细微点滴，以及人们互动交流时形形色色的方式与态度，更能够将这一切观察所得非常自如地融入他的作品之中。 \n 　　 \n 　　留出安静独处的时间 \n 　　 \n 　　写作对于卡夫卡来说就是一种祈祷仪式，因此他需要在宁静平和的状态下完成。尽管他是在犹太教的环境下长大且接受过犹太男子成人礼，但是他对犹太教的接受与触及也仅限于此。写作是卡夫卡抵达自己心灵与精神世界的方式，他的整个世界也因写作而变得更加美好。因此，不论你选择如何度过一天，只要你懂得享受宁静的时光，你的生活就会更加有条不紊、平和安宁。 \n 　　 \n 　　全身心投入自己热爱的事业 \n 　　 \n 　　为了生活，卡夫卡从事过几种不同的职业，但是我们都知道写作才是他一生坚持的事业，是他终生为之奋斗的目标，也是他所擅长与精通的。他的人生为我们诠释了一个道理：终其一生为自己热爱的事业奋斗也许不会给你带来成功，但是能让你感觉充实并拥有成就感。不过卡夫卡对自己的才华缺乏自信，这一点是不可取的。他认为自己的作品没有价值，不值得保存，因此要求好友马克斯·布洛德将自己的手稿全部焚毁。 \n 　　 \n 　　与世界的疏离感是普遍存在的 \n 　　 \n 　　作为一名生活在奥匈帝国时期的犹太人，卡夫卡总是感觉自己被周围的人疏离和排挤，这种感受也成了他笔下经常出现的一个主题。连一位如此伟大的作家都曾经遭受冷落和排斥，这也就有力地证明了一个道理：无论因为什么样的原因被人疏远和排斥，都是十分正常的。坚持下去，不要放弃，总有一天我们会被赏识，会找到自己真正归属的地方。 \n 　　 \n 　　坚持抗争 \n 　　 \n 　　在那些与官僚主义主题有关的小说中，例如《城堡》和《审判》等，卡夫卡笔下的人物总是坚持与一些遥不可及又无可名状的恶势力进行抗争，因为这些恶势力总是使他们的人生变得无比艰辛。小说中的主人公用自己的方式对命运做出的抗争，也在一定程度上折射出了卡夫卡对待人生的态度：屈从于不公正的压迫是毫无意义的人生。所以，当你感觉受到制度的迫害时，记住一定要坚持抗争。 \n 　　 \n 　　就算你身处绝境，也不能放弃 \n 　　 \n 　　所有卡夫卡小说中的主人公几乎都曾在各种难以想象的窘况中被逼入绝境，例如，被控以莫名的罪行、无法抵达必须到达的地点、变形成一种令人恶心的昆虫等。而且，正如前文所述，卡夫卡本人也曾经历了充满艰辛和坎坷的人生，所以虽然英国首相温斯顿·丘吉尔在卡夫卡辞世数十年之后才说出那句“就算你身处绝境，也不能放弃”的名言，卡夫卡早已用自己的人生和写作为这句话做出了最好的诠释。 \n 　　 \n 　　你永远无法逃离自己的文化传统 \n 　　 \n 　　卡夫卡的作品并没有清晰明确地呈现过犹太教的主题，他本人也并非一位虔诚的犹太教徒，然而研究卡夫卡的专家们几乎一致认为，犹太教传统对其写作产生的影响远大于他自己所意识到的。我们都有过希望与自己的过去或是家族传统决裂的时候，但是我们也应该认识到，这些传统与历史已经在我们的生命、性格和作品中留下了难以抹去的印记，即使我们自己并未意识到。 \n 　　 \n 　　人们是浮躁善变的 \n 　　 \n 　　这一条人生忠告来自卡夫卡的一篇短篇小说《饥饿艺术家》。小说的主人公是一位表演艺术家，他要在一段似乎很漫长的时间里表演绝食，忍受饥饿。表演在刚开始的阶段非常受欢迎，人们从各地蜂拥而来观看艺术家的这种奇特表演。但是当表演持续了一段时间后，流行的时尚发生了变化，人们的兴趣转向了其他表演，饥饿艺术家渐渐被遗忘，他只能孤独地继续这一项并不被人理解的表演。某一事物即使曾经一度盛况空前，但并不保证这种好景就能一直持续下去。位于布拉格市中心的名为《变形》的卡夫卡头部塑像。塑像高11米，由众多不锈钢板组成，每块钢板都可以上下移動和翻转官僚主义是最恶劣的 \n 　　 \n 　　卡夫卡生活在一个政府官僚主义大行其道的年代，他的一生经历了奥匈帝国的末期统治以及后来的捷克斯洛伐克共和国，这些都是靠制定各种森严法规和繁文缛节来对多民族的人口进行统治的国家。卡夫卡曾在保险行业就职，而且在法律专业获得法学博士，因此他的小说里出现在迷宫一般荒谬而又强大的官僚主义体制之中艰难生存的主题是不足为奇的。以他的长篇小说《城堡》为例，书中的主人公百般努力试图逾越官僚体制的层层阻碍，进入那座貌似近在眼前却又遥不可及、统治着整个地区的城堡，最终却以失败告终。", "timestamp": 1653270215, "digest": "VM2F13I9_-aZd3rk1cHeYzF-9G0AgM_fXRhHNiCxRS8", "contributor": "0x41e74aB868C9d252601E681b8C6B53Ee6C877022"}

{"id": "-pAzmgM3DYsn11biTA9P14E7WHE_033LrSrxxt17RAk", "title": "6 Years of Dedication: ViaBTC Prioritizes the User Experience & Insists on Product Innovation", "body": "Since the Bitcoin genesis block was mined in 2009, many BTC believers have joined the mining craze. As more crypto users start mining, the total Bitcoin hashrate has grown higher. Meanwhile, the hashrate share of a single miner in the entire BTC network has decreased over time. As a result, most solo miners find it difficult to earn stable returns, triggering the appearance of mining pools.\n\nA mining pool enables mining practices that leverage the combined strength of individual miners and mining farms, which allows miners to earn more stable returns. Miners are not always tied together with one pool but can connect their hashrate to a different pool at any moment. To gain more support from the miner community, mining pools are engaged in increasingly intense competition with one another.\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9qt-Nh1VFtovgs95k4Qn6.png?height=875&width=1400)\n\n# Bring industry-wide changes via constant innovations\n\nBack in 2016, most mining pools either offered fixed returns (PPS) or actual returns (PPLNS) based on a miner’s hashrate. The former payment method does not provide miners with miner fee rewards, while the latter comes with unstable returns.\n\nMeanwhile, a BTC mining pool called ViaBTC was founded on June 5, 2016. Soon after its inception, ViaBTC Pool created a new payment method named PPS+ based on two traditional models: PPS and PPLNS. Under PPS+, miners earn stable returns, as well as the miner fee. As such, the actual profit miners earn through ViaBTC far exceeds that they could otherwise get via other pools.\n\nViaBTC’s adoption of PPS+ innovated the profit distribution models used by mining pools at the time. Subsequently, many mainstream mining pools have followed suit and started using PPS+, which facilitated an industry-wide change in mining rules.\n\nAt the same time, ViaBTC constantly strives for tech improvements. Regarding the orphan rate, which is a top concern among miners, ViaBTC Pool optimized the broadcasting and transmitting process of the BTC network through its independently developed BTC client. Thanks to its high-speed block updating networks distributed around the world, miners can discover and broadcast new blocks more quickly. For miners, these efforts also lower the orphan rate, ensure the mining profit, and improve the operating efficiency of the BTC network. To date, ViaBTC remains the mining pool with the lowest orphan rate in the entire network.\n\nViaBTC is also the first pool to launch free transaction acceleration services, allowing global BTC users to benefit from faster confirmation. This also meets the demand for urgent transactions when the network is congested. Relying on its innovative payment method, ViaBTC Pool has attracted a large group of miners in a very short period, and its sound tech support has also built a strong bond of trust between these miners and ViaBTC. In less than 6 months after its inception, the pool became one of the top 5 BTC pools in terms of hashrate. At its peak, ViaBTC was the second-largest BTC pool worldwide.\n\n# Put users first & achieve steady growth\n\nThough ViaBTC gained extensive miner recognition soon after its launch, the pool did not stop there. Instead, it has prioritized user experiences and kept improving its products. To offer more reassuring miner services, ViaBTC has adopted multiple visual representations to provide real-time, detailed, transparent statistics of pools and miners. Moreover, it is also one of the few pools where mining profits are settled on an hourly basis.\n\nViaBTC also introduced Auto Conversion to better ensure miners’ returns, allowing users to convert assets into BTC or USDT easily and automatically. Meanwhile, having accounted for miners’ demands, the pool tapped into conventional financial tools and released two innovative financial services (Hedging Service & Crypto Loans), which help miners much improve their capital efficiency.\n\nPutting users first and always engaged in product innovation, ViaBTC has made it to its 6th year via solid efforts. Right now, the pool has built a global presence, providing mining services for more than one million users in over 130 countries and regions, and covering 17 crypto assets such as BTC, LTC, and ETH. At its height, it ranked №1 among all BTC and LTC pools by hashrate. So far, ViaBTC has registered mining output totaling tens of billions of dollars.\n\n# Create a blockchain-enabled world through solid efforts\n\nDuring the past 13 years since the first BTC block was mined, the crypto market has been flooded with doubters and speculators. Unaffected by such views, ViaBTC has built superior products favored by users via solid efforts and become one of the few companies in the crypto market that have been running for six years.\n\nIn the future, ViaBTC will remain committed to its mission — Via Blockchain, Making the World a Better Place. Starting from its 5 existing business segments that cover the mining pool, exchange, wallet, public chain, and investment, ViaBTC will integrate the application scenarios of crypto assets and build an all-encompassing ecosystem. Guided by its vision of being the infrastructure of the blockchain world, ViaBTC will enable crypto progress while offering more user-friendly blockchain products.\n\nFind us here:\nWebsite ▶️ <https://www.coinex.com>\nTwitter ▶️ <https://twitter.com/coinexcom/>\nTelegram ▶️ <https://t.me/CoinExOfficialEN>\nMedium ▶️ <https://medium.com/@coinex>\nReddit ▶️ <https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinEx/>\nFacebook ▶️ <https://www.facebook.com/thecoinex/>\nInstagram ▶️ <https://www.instagram.com/coinexcom/>\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1653270351, "digest": "r8i8lSdJJ88B6O-mD1E7BF41loAXjcUKwL_8cbfgKow", "contributor": "0xD5806ddb5249d34D389aB4D4a042AD24e05cef39"}

数据分析\n\n注意，以下数据是字节君从网络上抓到的数据，可能会有遗漏部分项目。若生态上的项目方希望自己的数据可以公布给字节元周刊的读者，可以联系字节君。\n\n### 2.1 ForceBridge\n\nForce Bridge 是 Nervos 上开源的通用跨链协议。Force Bridge 的网址为 [forcebridge.com](https://forcebridge.com)。\n\n截至本刊发布，ForceBridge 已上线 Ethereum 、BSC 两座桥，使得 Ethereum 、BSC 、Nervos 生态之间的价值能够流转起来。\n\n数据方面，截至本刊发布，*通过 ForceBridge 跨过来锁定的资产 TVL 分别是：*\n\n* **Ethereum 上：$10,352,404**\n* **BSC 上：$2,005,143**\n\n接下来看看 Ethereum 桥的资产数据：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WbowTpTs5aTtdfupapJxI.png?height=1606&width=2128)\n\n（*数据来自https://dune.xyz/lefey/forcebridge.com*）\n\n上图可以看到，**从以太坊跨过来的 ETH 数量为 2,240 枚，从以太坊跨过来的 USDC 为 5,308,653 枚。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BvDlTzQf7RAfD3EUSyi6j.png?height=602&width=1060)\n\n**上图显示了 ETH 跨链桥上的资产分布情况：** 从以太坊跨过来的资产中，USDC 占比为 51.3%，ETH 占比为 43.4%。\n\n再来看看来自 BSC 的跨链数据：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nXKYVqJ_ejw52QheXn5VO.png?height=1498&width=1400)\n\n（*数据来自https://dune.xyz/lefey/forcebridge.com*）\n\n上图可以看到，**从 BSC 跨过来的 BNB 数量为 5,824 枚。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E5mf57qmY8XA98gev-AbJ.png?height=584&width=1276)\n\n**上图显示了 BSC 跨链桥上的资产分布情况：** 从 BSC 跨过来的资产中，BNB 占比为 74.8%，BTCB 占比为 12.6%，USDT 占比为 5.6%，USDC 占比为 6.9%。\n\n更多数据，可以到下面这两个页面查看（数据面板页面会不断迭代更新）：\n\n* <https://dune.xyz/zjuhwc/Force-Bridge>\n* <https://dune.xyz/lefey/forcebridge.com>\n\n### 2.2 Layer 2\n\nGodwoken，这套包含了 Polyjuice 的 EVM 兼容层 + Rollup 扩容的 Layer2 解决方案，于 2021 年 11 月 4 日宣布在 Nervos CKB 主网上线 Beta v0 版本，之后在其之上线了 YokaiSwap、Daruma、StableKoi 等应用。在此期间，Godwoken 也在准备着兼容性更好的 v1 版本的开发，目前 v1 版本已经在测试网上线，开发者可申请参与白名单计划，申请链接：\n\n[https://share.hsforms.com/1TtzKmmjMR1ayq9vYF9G3dgcadup](https://share.hsforms.com/1TtzKmmjMR1ayq9vYF9G3dgcadup)\n\nGodwoken 为 CKB 提供了扩展能力以及基于账户的编程模型，使得以太坊系的 dApp 均可以接入到 Nervos 的 Layer 2 中来。更多信息，欢迎访问：\n\n[https://www.nervos.org/godwoken/](https://www.nervos.org/godwoken/)\n\n在字节君看来，**现在这个阶段是开发者进入 CKB 建设的好时机，因为几乎没有竞争，并且非常容易得到来自 Nervos 团队的手把手支持。**\n\n数据方面，据 DefiLlama 关于 Godwoken 网络上的统计数据，如下图所示：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SmvXPJQErmneesA9M_8b_.png?height=1628&width=1950)\n\nGodwoken 上的更多数据， 可以通过以下链接查看： <https://defillama.com/chain/Godwoken> 。\n\n### 2.3 网络算力\n\n下图是 CKB 主网上线以来的全网算力走势图，从 2019/11/16 至今，算力从最初的 0.073 P 增长至今，期间算力最高的时候超过 150P，算力增长超过 2,000 倍。\n\n**不过最近，随着币价的下跌，CKB 全网算力首次跌破最近半年来的最低值——100P。字节君判断，这是触达部分矿工的关机价了，并且这个趋势还会进一步延续，因为自从2021年国内挖矿清退之后，对于普通用户来讲（超级大矿工除外，它们有资源），就很难找到低价电来挖矿，7 毛以上一度电已经算是便宜的了。有一部分矿工是按月提前支付了费用，也就是说到期之后，如果币价还没有明显起色，那么这些矿工还会陆续关机。到六月中旬，一个自然月过去后，剩下来的算力就是那些能拿到低成本的网络算力。**\n\n我们来看看具体的算力数据走势。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f5lnrKFSKi5y001OPvBfG.png?height=700&width=1708)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UoyH79FH01u3xgIvdj6fT.png?height=1002&width=1870)\n\n**7 日平均算力**： 100.31P，（ *上期该值为  124.37P* ）\n**最近 7 日平均算力增长幅度**：-19.35%\n**30 日平均算力**：\t124.4P，（*上期该值为 133.42P* ）\n**最近 30 日平均算力幅度**：\t-10.47%\n**每 T 算力产出 CKB 数量**：大约 115 枚（ \\*上期该值为 112 CKB \\* ）\n\n### 2.4 YokaiSwap 数据一览\n\n#### 2.4.1 质押比例走势\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LvwDqdoR1lYjeyhEjz2ND.png?height=1226&width=1964)\n\n上图为 [YokaiSwap](https://www.yokaiswap.com/) 上线以来的质押图，其中红色部分为锁到农场里的 YOK，蓝色为锁定到自动资金池中的 YOK，绿色为锁定到手动资金池中的 YOK，最后黄色这部分为未锁定的 YOK。\n\n由图中可见，目前有大约 6.18% 的 YOK 处于未质押的状态，上一期该值为 5.74% 。\n\n### 2.5 Daruma 数据一览\n\n#### 2.5.1 $DRM 质押比例\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tB4eUUkGAcDr-sb1531Zl.png?height=740&width=1464)\n\n上图显示了自 DarumaDAO 上线以来，$DRM 的质押比例走势。截至本刊发布前：\n\n* 有 81.82% 的 DRM 被质押到 Daruma 中。\n* 有 17.64% 的 DRM 用于提供流动性，主要是 DRM/CKB交易对。\n* 有 0.54% 的 DRM 目前出于观望状态。\n\n#### 2.5.2 $DRM APY 走势\n\n再来看看 $DRM 的年化收益，一天自动复利 3 次，当前年化为 468%。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mNZaXfv-vU9nJ8cH2sup3.png?height=696&width=1448)\n\n图中的跳跃点分别发生在 4/3、5/21，鉴于目前 $DRM 的需求还不大，Daruma 社区建议进一步降低  DRM 的通胀率，开发团队在收到社区建议后，先后于4/3、5/21 凌晨（北京时间）调整了 DRM 的供给速度，减半，**这个过程称为 Rebase。**\n\n这次调整过后，使得 Daruma 的年化收益与 OlympusDAO 接近。\n\n更多 Daruma 的数据可以到 <https://godwoken.info/daruma-stats.html> 查看。\n\n### 2.6 StableKOI\n\n[StableKOI](stablekoi.com) 上锁定了 $748,710.33 的资产。来自以太坊、BSC的稳定币、BTC，可以在其上进行相互兑换：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DnUX7PdaylB_pZ0Am5YG1.png?height=1384&width=992)\n\n### 2.7 秘宝\n\n秘宝（[mibao.net](https://mibao.net)）是 Nervos 上首个合规的 NFT 平台，专注为各种创作者、开发者、第三方平台提供元宇宙价值层的技术服务。随着 Mibao 的 NFT 协议的升级（CoTA）上线，Mibao NFT的分销成本已经降低到几乎为零，大大降低了企业的获客成本，同时助力企业营销、快速实现用户裂变，为企业抢占市场提供先机。\n\n来看看截至本刊发布时，秘宝平台的 NFT 数据：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ya71QpHRFu8AMq8tCvxoe.png?height=184&width=1200)\n\n过去一周，秘宝平台上的 NFT 数量增加了 **8,000+** 个，创作者总数增加 **11** 人，持有人总数增加约 **1,000** 人。\n\n### 2.8 .bit （之前的 DAS）\n\n[.bit](https://did.id) 是 Nervos 上的 DID （去中心化身份）。\n\n*截至北京时间 4月16日 16:00， [das.la](https://das.la) 上的统计数据如下所示：*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oOcJGVH0nUC8MvyXkfne2.png?height=1762&width=1760)\n\n**上周全网 .bit 注册账号增加约 2000 个，增加了 380 个新的账号持有者地址（独立Owner）。**\n\n目前已开放 4-9 位 60% 的账号，10 位以及 10 位以上的全部账号，可通过由社区开发的选号工具 [das.la](http://das.la) 选号注册。\n\n## 3.  值得关注的动态\n\n### 3.1 .bit 已完成 Web3Auth 的集成\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xB_tWJwQNHbOdc9jmhq6K.png?height=1610&width=1186)\n\n当你进入 .bit 页面（[did.id](http://did.id)），在链接钱包环境时，会看到新增了一个社交账号登录的入口，而这个入口，就是对接 Web3Auth 提供的接口。\n\n这样一来，社交账号也可以作为 .bit 的 Owner 了。\n\n### 3.2 NFT平台——未物主义开启公测\n\n5/20，未物主义开启公测，并计划于 5/27 正式上线。公测期间，可以将你遇到的问题反馈到discord 频道内。\n\n看一下页面效果：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Fmyb9MOxjSRhK8PSqcQOl.png?height=1670&width=766)\n\n据悉，正式上线时，会有一个全新的 UI 改版，同时也会启动一系列的活动。感兴趣的小伙伴，可以进入体验参与公测，下面是字节君的邀请链接，请放心使用：<http://m.wwzy.club/pages/auth/register?refererCode=FTNK_2wBIAI=&share=1>\n\n### 3.3 [Kollect.me](http://Kollect.me) 将推出资产管理工具\n\n上个月 Kollect 上线了 V2 版本之后，遗留了一些 bug，其中集中反馈最多的就是用户在 v1 挂单了的 NFT 无法在 dapp 里查看并操作的问题，像这样：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pVlc6N4eDi3Sfijwxffc1.png?height=1214&width=1188)\n\n鉴于这些反馈，Kollect 决定开发一个独立的工具，提供给大家使用，他们**计划**是本月会提供出来：\n\n从这条推特发布的时间来看（5/16），是在 V2 版本上线接近一个月之后才发布出来，而在这期间有多少用户为其账户里面的 NFT 而苦恼？Kollect 为什么要等过了这么久才发布这个动态？（附：下图为 [Kollect.me](http://Kollect.me) 上线时的推特，日期是4/22）\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BXBrioG4h9jg6dUr8Pxb_.png?height=1552&width=1174)\n\n**希望能把问题消灭在萌芽状态。**\n\n### 3.4 Daruma Eggs合约将重大升级\n\nDaruma Eggs 上线两期抽奖之后，广泛收集了来自社区的意见，之后开发团队决定先暂停抽奖，等待按照社区意见修改完成之后再上线。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TNwS2v4oKJKvcmWLWFDv5.png?height=872&width=1788)\n\n### 3.5 🥳 PokerPepes 官网已上线，即将开启mint！\n\n扑克项目 PokerPepes 已于今日上线全新官网：[https://pokerpepes.com/，在介绍中，可以看到即将](https://pokerpepes.com/%EF%BC%8C%E5%9C%A8%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D%E4%B8%AD%EF%BC%8C%E5%8F%AF%E4%BB%A5%E7%9C%8B%E5%88%B0%E5%8D%B3%E5%B0%86) mint ：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/L-MfJN2C9fEFuz1KSWmo1.png?height=1662&width=764)\n\n### 3.6 🔥.bit 注册工具 [das.la](http://das.la) 集成 OpenSea\n\n[das.la](http://das.la) 作为 .bit 社区里最受欢迎的选号工具，上周集成了 OpenSea 的接口，当你在das.la页面上停留时，会自动拉取 ENS 的最新成交记录，并滚动显在页面上，快来看看效果吧：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xp_0dTmXUZzlszUfcdOuF.png?height=1712&width=2024)\n\n通过这个功能，可以实时把握不同账号类型的受欢迎度，作为注册账号时的参考工具。\n\n### 3.7 🛠️Nervos 基金会启动 Web3 开发者扶持计划\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/C_-VpIH-FxnNCvm3lH_hK.png?height=456&width=810)\n\n5月初，Nervos 基金会启动 Web3 开发者扶持计划——Nervos Build Club，它是一个全新的扶持计划，旨在帮助 Web3 开发者，为他们提供搭建 dApp 所需的资源和点对点的支持。\n\n**哪些人可以加入 Nervos Build Club？**\n\n这项扶持计划将面向所有热衷于使用当下的应用程序来创建 Web3 项目，并希望将其转化为可扩展业务的人员。\n\n目前，Nervos Build Club 正在接纳希望从事 DeFi 项目、集成、原生项目、克隆、实用型应用项目、NFT 等工作的人员。 Nervos的扶持计划将帮助 Web3 项目的建设者：\n\n* 获得来自 Nervos 基金会在市场推广方面的支持\n* 优先提供的技术支持\n* 和 Web3 领域主要领导者的交流机会\n* 点对点的开发支持\n* 为项目获得风险投资和在 DEX 上进行 IDO 牵线搭桥\n* 获得 Grant 资助的机会\n\n**为什么要在 Nervos 上进行开发？**\n\nNervos 将帮助你启动支持多链的 dApp。你可以使用 Solidity，就像你在以太坊上做开发那样，但你在 Nervos 上做开发可以拥有与其他区块链互操作的额外好处。\n\n因此，你不必为不同的区块链构建不同版本的 dApp。\n\n**这是如何实现的呢？**\n\nNervos 采用了分层网络架构，有 2 层：\n\n* Layer 1 提供最高级别的区块链安全性和最彻底的去中心化。\n* Layer 2 专注于性能，具有很高的吞吐量。它很灵活，提供了更好的用户体验，交易能力不受限，交易成本十分低廉。\n  因此，通过 Layer 1 和 Layer 2，Nervos 解决了当前区块链系统中的互操作性和可扩展性问题。\n\n简而言之，Nervos 生态为那些不想舍弃以太坊的优势——完善的基础设施、完备的工具和详尽的文档资料，但又不想忍受以太坊的缺陷——网络拥堵、Gas 费高昂、过度饱和、可扩展性受限等缺陷的人员，提供了一个还不错的解决方案。\n\n还等什么，赶快加入 Nervos Build Club 吧！申请链接：<https://share.hsforms.com/1OJsK4yV_QLW4Cf06QJwODwcadup>\n\n### 3.8 📢Hackthon\n\n2022 年，在各种大大小小的 Hackthon 大赛上，都能看到 Nervos

Web3.0从何而来，又将何去？\n\n当下的Web2.0互联网似乎在“吞噬”着一切领域，人们不禁谈论着Web2.0红利的消失。始于2008年的区块链以去中心化的方式，从最初的点对点支付逐渐开始冲击着整个数字世界，尤其是近年来智能合约、DeFi、NFT等创新的出现，使得数字网络出现了新的范式可能。电子屏幕和各类终端设备背后的数字世界，将在Web3.0的推动下，主导权由互联网巨头向用户转移。\n\n虽然Web3.0的轮廓依旧模糊，Web2.0巨头们似乎并未感受到其压力，但来自社区的创新将很快改变这一切。\n\n2\\.1. Web1.0到Web3.0：互联网经历了什么\n\n回顾互联网从Web1.0到Web2.0的演进，我们可以看到围绕流量争夺、流量变现的变迁。Web1.0到Web2.0，流量从供给不足（互联网刚出现）再到市场争夺流量入口（互联网普及），进而流量变现，中间还经历了从PC互联网到移动互联网的演变。Web1.0和Web2.0可以说是流量为王的时代。虽然基础设施到应用层面的创新不断，但是流量为王的逻辑是不变的。流量背后，控制着用户流量的生态公司将享有最多的市场红利。相应的，用户的行为数据、用户体验都是在生态公司的限制下进行，用户创造和建设活动受到了一定的限制、且无法获得数据收益。类似的案例非常普遍，如支付工具的跨平台限制、跨平台的超链接屏蔽等等。流量不仅限于用户的注意力，还包括资金流量，关于后者相当于Web2.0对传统金融的侵蚀。\n\n用户在Web1.0和Web2.0时代，用户的行为是受限的，用户数据隐私得不到充分的保护，用户在互联网中的创作和建设力度是偏弱的，即便是类似抖音这样的短视频平台，用户的创作也接受者平台的监管，创造的形式和内容也无法脱离平台本身的引导和限制；平台通过少数流量大V引导着绝大部分用户的内容体验。\n\n可以说，Web2.0时代，以互联网巨头为核心，形成一个个生态圈，生态内，核心互联网公司“统治”着生态，垄断着生态的数据、价值和网络效应。\n\n图片\n\n这一切在Web3.0时代将发生深刻的变化：Web3.0世界将充分开放化，用户在其中的行为将不受生态隔离的限制，甚至可以认为，用户可以（基于基础逻辑）自由畅游在Web3世界；用户数据隐私将通过加密算法和分布式存储等手段得到保护；Web3世界，内容和应用将由用户创造和主导，充分实现用户共建、共治（DAO，去中心化治理），同时用户将分享平台（协议）的价值。\n\n除了完全不同的互联网模式和用户体验，Web3将带来新的流量入口范式。Web2时代占据用户注意力的流量入口模式将发生一些有趣的变化。\n\n在以区块链为代表的分布式技术推动下，从去中心化点对点账本实验到去中心化智能合约平台，催生了无数的新型应用（Dapp），慢慢DeFi形成了数字世界里的“金融服务”，而NFT加速了资产上链。我们看到，传统世界（线上和线下）之外，用户越来越接近一个相融相生的数字世界。至此，人们呼唤一个全新的网络世界——元宇宙，即可信地承载个人的社交身份和资产，社区将拥有更强大的主导权。\n\n以上就是Web3.0的进化简史。\n\n图片\n\n本报告将通过一些具体案例来剖析Web3开放、隐私、共建的特点，并分析新的流量入口和价值范式的内涵。\n\n2\\.2. Web3.0生态已现雏形\n\nWeb 3.0技术堆栈主要可分为三层：协议层、应用层以及网络基础层。这一切主要是基于区块链构建的（当然协议层也可以有链下的辅助部分）。从应用角度看，Web 3.0则涵盖DAO（及工具）、隐私、应用、存储和数据、游戏、创作者经济平台、社交等几乎覆盖Web2.0的大部分领域。\n\n伴随着加密货币行业的蓬勃发展，近两年涌现了大量的Web3.0应用，当然，这些应用最终也许大部分都是过渡期产品。甚至有些应用在经济模式、解决用户痛点方面存在着缺陷，并未体现出比Web2.0更真实需求。\n\n无论如何，Web3.0生态已现雏形，在不断的应用探索中，将一步步揭开Web3.0的面纱。\n\n图片\n\n1. Web3的标签：开放、隐私和共建的世界\n\n3\\.1. 开放：Web3.0打破生态界限\n\nWeb3.0的开放性体现在：\n\n用户在某个互联网应用“领域”中的准入充分自由、门槛低；例如，用户往往利用一个区块链账户地址就可以登录链上的应用，无须注册许可，操作便利；\n\n用户行为不受第三方主体限制、互联网应用打破原有的所谓生态内、生态间的界限和隔阂，在复合代码运行逻辑的原则下，应用之间具有高度的组合性和复合性；最直接的案例就是所谓DeFi Lego，任何应用都可以对底层基础协议（如DEX）做调用或聚合，以及合成资产平台将现实世界资产映射到链上（无交割关系），这等于打破了所谓线上线下和虚拟与现实的界限。\n\n另外，Web3.0内部基于不同基础设施的应用之间可以被“跨链”协议解决互联互通；因此，用户在Web3.0世界多个应用的行为可以生产类似社交关系图谱，进一步提升数据价值的挖掘潜力。\n\n举一个游戏应用的比喻，用户可以不受第三方限制、很方便进入一个游戏世界；用户可以将自身喜欢的角色/形象自由植入到游戏中去，甚至可以使得角色跨平台/领域行动，而Web2.0时代，如王者荣耀这类游戏，你无法决定角色的选择，更不能将喜欢的孙悟空杀进魔兽世界——这方面的连通平台并不难，只是因为控制权并不在用户手中。当然，你也可以交易角色皮肤等装备（借助NFT），甚至基于其他DeFi协议建立复杂的游戏装备衍生品市场。总之，跨应用平台、跨虚拟与现实地完成Web3.0的生存方式。\n\n本节将以ENS、MASK Network和Polkdot为例，阐释开放的意义。\n\n3\\.1.1. ENS（Ethereum Name Service）：去中心化的身份验证和域名系统\n\nDNS（Domain Name System）是传统Web2.0的重要组成部分。当用户上网时，服务器会将用户的网址请求解析成IP地址返回给用户。\n\n如www. [https://www.bilibili.com/域名对应的IP地址可能为http://](https://www.bilibili.com/%E5%9F%9F%E5%90%8D%E5%AF%B9%E5%BA%94%E7%9A%84IP%E5%9C%B0%E5%9D%80%E5%8F%AF%E8%83%BD%E4%B8%BAhttp://) 119.3.211.130。这种可读性更高的域名系统降低了用户访问网址时的难度，为Web2.0的建设做出了重要贡献。DNS解决了Web2.0访问的问题，然而随着网址的不断增多以及Web2.0中心化的特点，用户往往需要注册大量的网站账号，用来访问不同的网站。针对这一问题，尽管许多应用支持了使用较为主流的第三方社交APP（如微信等）直接登录，但总体来看，这种各大网站直接分散割裂而导致用户需要注册大量账号的问题依然存在。总体来说，用户需要通过注册，才能够使用中心化机构管理的域名和账户系统来访问应用。用户如何做到无许可、更低门槛访问各类互联网应用？\n\n图片\n\n图片\n\n不同于Web2.0的中心化特点，Web3.0世界用户登录行为依靠去中心化身份，DID （Decentralized IDentity）。最常用的一类DID即用户仅使用一个链上账号（区块链公钥地址，以0x开头的42位字符串）来访问各类Web3.0的DApp，即单点登录。虽然为Web3.0的用户安全提供更自由、门槛更低的访问体验，然而过长的公钥显然难以记忆、可读性差。构建在以太坊上面的域名系统，ENS（Ethereum Name Service）的出现正是致力于这一问题的解决，将用户的钱包地址与自定义的域名进行连接，如将类似0xaa111aaa1aa11aaa11a111a111aa1a1a11a11111的钱包地址改为GuoSheng.eth这一更为可读的域名。在之后登录各类DApp时，就可以使用GuoSheng.eth这一域名进行登录，用户之间可以通过此域名进行转账交互等行为。\n\n总结而言，更为开放的Web3.0则支持用户仅使用一个账户（钱包地址）完成访问DApp、与其他用户进行交互等各种操作。ENS的出现解决了Web3.0中用户互动的可读性难题，为单点登录创造了更便利的条件。\n\n构建在以太坊上的ENS可以支持多链地址的解析。用户可以将同一个ENS域名在比特币、以太坊和莱特币等不同链解析的不同的地址，同时ENS也具备内容寻址的功能（不同于Web2.0的IP寻址），解析到互联网应用网站平台。\n\n可以想象，未来的Web3.0时代，用户在元宇宙中遨游（可以跨多个应用），无须注册许可，而通过一个简短的域名账户进行登录即可。\n\n3\\.1.2. MASK Network：通向Web3.0的开放大门\n\nMask Network是一组连接传统Web2.0应用与Web3.0应用的插件，为前者用户提供了进入Web3.0的大门。其开发的技术框架Dapplet（Decentralized Applet）支持在目标网站（如Facebook、Twitter等传统Web2.0网站），将小程序嵌入其中，以此在中心化的Web2.0中实现小程序的去中心化。之后其与Arweave展开合作，支持在Facebook、Twitter上进行去中心化文件的上传和存储。\n\n当前，用户只用在浏览器中安装Mask插件，即可在Twitter或Facebook上查看Token价格、进行swap、参与ITO（Initial Twitter Offering）以及参与社区投票（借助如snapshot等Web3.0应用）。同时还支持用户将链上资产（包括NFT收藏、捐赠记录）汇总至Twitter。\n\nMask带来的开放性是显而易见的，即任何Web2.0中的用户都可在不借助任何中心化APP或平台的前提下，通过Mask来直接访问Web3.0并进行相关活动。Mask将开放的Web3.0世界，通过零门槛的方式展现在了每位Web2.0用户眼前。也就是说，MASK将Twitter与区块链平台打通，用户可以自由地在多个平台应用之间遨游。这在Web2.0生态下几乎很难做到。\n\n图片\n\n3\\.1.3. Polkdot：连接Web3.0内鸿沟的桥\n\n常有投资者问起：未来是一个元宇宙还是多个元宇宙？它们之间能否互通？\n\n互通分多个层次，应用层、协议层等，一个重要的问题是NFT等数字资产无论是存放在联盟链（蚂蚁链、至信链、长安链等）还是公链（以太坊、比特币等），跨链互通是最基本的，而区块链本身是个带时间戳的账本，如何实现互操作？\n\n不同公链之间是无法直接传递消息和执行操作的，Web3.0内部诸多应用协议（可能是基于不同的底层公链）之间的鸿沟往往通过跨链的方式实现互联互通。当然，Web3.0协议之间跨接一般不需要第三方主体进行授权（注册），这一点仍然遵循Web3.0的开放性原则。跨链可以是跨链资产桥（类似于多链资产兑换银行），也可以是波卡、Cosmos这类多链协议。\n\n波卡（Polkadot）是一个可伸缩的异构多链系统，能够传递任何数据（不只限于代币）到所有区块链，实现各个链之间资产与数据的互相流通。波卡是由Web3基金会发起的项目，由以太坊前CTO Gavin Wood主导的Parity团队进行设计和开发。波卡网络的基础构架包括中继链（Relay Chain）、平行链（Parachain）和转接桥（Bridge），波卡是一个真正的多链应用环境，使跨链注册和跨链计算等类似操作成为可能。\n\n如果是比特币是计算器（电子现金系统）、以太坊是区块链世界的计算机，那么波卡就是路由器或者交换机，在计算设备（无论是windows系统还是苹果系统，甚至是移动设备）之间可以传递数据，实现万链互联。站在这个角度，波卡解决的问题不仅仅是公链自身性能瓶颈（更快的交易处理速度），而是从更丰富的角度解决扩展性——使得原本不兼容的链之间实现互操作，为多链共存的未来世界提供中枢或者路由。波卡系统是由一堆独立运行的区块链组成的，波卡为这些区块链（成为平行链）提供中继路由。\n\n图片\n\n波卡作为中继链，为平行链间传递消息提供基础设施，值得注意的是，所传递的消息不仅限于代币（Token），而是任意数据；平行链之间的类型可以不同（异构）。这一点非常重要，目前的区块链作为一个分布式账本，矿工处理的工作主要就是维护账户，区块内最核心的数据就是账户代币余额，其他文本数据可以作为附注写入，但很难在区块间自由传递消息；并且，跨接的两条区块链可以是不同类型（甚至是私有链）。基于波卡可以在公共、开放、未经许可的区块链以及私有、许可区块链之间传输此数据。波卡是真正的多链应用程序环境，在其中可以进行跨链注册表和跨链计算之类的事情。例如，学校的许可链上的私有学术记录链可以向公共链上的学位验证智能合约发送证明。再例如，跟先前主要作为独立环境运行的网络不同，波卡提供了互操作性和跨链通信。这为创新的新服务打开了大门，同时，也允许用户在链之间进行信息传输。例如，提供交易代币化的股票（用代币来标记股票）的交易所的链，可以跟提供股票交易所帧数数据的链（预言机链）通信，例如为代币化的股票交易提供喂价。\n\n3\\.2. 隐私：数据所有权和价值的转移\n\n数据隐私已成为全球监管的焦点问题，现行的解决方案一是强化法律保护，让使用者意识到盗用用户数据是违法行为；二是引入隐私计算，通过同态加密、多方安全计算、可信执行环境等技术，保证数据在使用过程中是明文不可见的。在Web3.0时代，用户将倾向于用更彻底的方式保护个人数据隐私，从而引发数据所有权和价值的转移。随着应用的去中心化，链上数据可查的情况下，用户行为、产生的数据乃至应用协议亦需得到隐私保护。隐私保护是多方面的，包括基础区块链平台隐私保护、存储数据隐私（分布式存储）、用户私钥管理、匿名协议等多方面。\n\n本节以Horizen、NuCypher为例探讨Web3.0隐私特点，前者可以为用户（包括企业用户）提供一个不上传本地隐私数据前提下完成开发的基础区块链平台，企业可以借此为用户提供区块链相关服务，但又充分保护了企业的隐私数据；后者为Web3.0用户提供了一个分布式私钥共享/托管平台，不同于Web2.0时代中心化机构托管用户账户的方式（让渡部分隐私），Web3.0的管理也可以去中心化地交给网络。\n\n3\\.2.1. Horizen：保护隐私前提下的开发平台\n\nHorizen原名Zencash，致力于打造隐私保护和基础区块链平台，为用户或企业可以在不上传本地隐私数据的前提下提供开发平台。Horizen由主链和侧链构成。Horizen主链主要是为用户的交互提供简单且安全的价值传输和存储层，通过原生治理代币ZEN为整个Horizen的生态运转提供支持，以及为侧链提供必要的基础架构。而具体功能的实现以及网络基础结构等均由侧链开发完成，从而能够针对特定的用例进行更为复杂的性能优化，增强其可扩展性和安全性。Horizen侧链又称Zendoo，其具有极高的扩展性和设计性。侧链有独立的共识机制与加密算法，并且真正的实现了去中心化。开发者可通过Horizen开放的一套标准通用组件ZEN侧链开发套件（SDK）来迅速完成区块链的开发，从而节省区块链的构建时间。利用侧链附带的零知识证明工具可以在不上传本地隐私数据的前提下，完成企业需求的开发。\n\n图片\n\n同时，主链与侧链之间可以通过其独创的跨链传输协议CCTP（The CrossChain Transfer Protocol）实现代币ZEN以及数据的互联传输，为解决可扩展性问题提供基础保障。\n\n图片\n\nHorizen采用Zk-snark（零知识证明）以及防51%攻击等安全解决方案构建了一个具有极高隐私保护性以及安全性的Web3.0区块链平台，为用户与开发者提供隐私保护。\n\n图片\n\n3\\.2.2. NuCypher：Web3.0的分布式密钥管理系统\n\n不同于Web2.0应用的密钥托管（一般由互联网公司或第三方托管），区块链私钥管理，对很多初级用户来说是一个难题，而多方共享私钥管理（去中心化的方式）则是一个更为现实的需求。用户该如何借助互联网协议安全地管理和共享私钥呢？也就是说，多方共享私钥管理可以将私钥托管给一个去中心化的网络协议（而非Web2.0那样交给互联网公司），在指定的用户间安全共享，使得用户解决了进入Web3.0之前最基础的需求。\n\nNuCypher能够在互联网上任意数量的用户之间共享私钥，同时使用其核心技术——代理重加密来代理解密权限。其原生代币NU主要用于奖励网络节点参与者来执行密钥管理和权限代理/回收的操作。\n\n传统中心化密钥管理系统（KMS）的用户密钥交由中心化第三方存储，在第三方存储机构安全的前提下，用户密钥可以得到较为充分且安全的保护。在用户双方需要进行数据传输时，数据发送者需要从第三方机构调用数据接收者的公钥对数据进行加密，之后数据接收者使用自己的私钥对数据进行解密。但其缺点在于，数据发送者只能使用数据接收者的公钥进行加密，数据传输后数据接收者可以永久保留对数据的访问权限。\n\n图片\n\n而NuCypher采取的代理重加密KMS使用第三方节点分布存储用户的密钥信息。在用户进行数据传输时，首先由数据发送者使用自身私钥和数据接收者公钥生成重新加密密钥，此后将密钥切分为\\[n\\]段，将每个片段分发给NuCypher上的节点进行保存。之后，数据接收者仅有权限在由数据发送者制定的时间段内访问该信息，数据发送者也可随时撤销数据接收者的访问权限。\n\n图片\n\n如此一来，NuCypher保证了数据发送者的加密授权主动性，同时分布式的密钥存储方案确保了用户密钥存储的安全性，为Web3.0数据传输的密钥管理提供了安全的保障。\n\n3\\.3. DAO：共建、共治和共享价值的网络世界\n\n用户在Web2.0互联网应用中的内容创造是多方面受限的（受平台审核限制、跨平台限制），在社区治理方面的限制更甚，因此也就限制了用户在创作者经济共享方面的价值捕获。Web3.0开放性原则将打破这些限制，同时区块链的激励机制将内容经济的价值有效地反馈给创作者。\n\n3\\.3.1. Mirror：完全由用户主导的内容创作平台\n\nMirror类似于Medium、Substack等博客类内容创作平台。其解决的问题在于，在传统自媒体中，内容创作者可以输出创意，但获得是收益是有限的，且面临IP被盗问题，能否将创意固化为资产并支持交易？Mirror当前主要功能包括：\n\n1）作品（Entries）：\n\nEntries是Mirror主要的内容创作模块，创作者可以在此处进行文档编辑，编辑支持纯文本+Markdown（类似话题标签）的格式，同时Mirror还支持直接将Medium或Substack等其他平台的文章迁移至Mirror。对于创作者的每一篇产出，Mirror均支持将其直接铸造为NFT。NFT在链上完成铸造之后，创作者便可将其作品以NFT的形式出售。这样一来，便解决了内容创作者的收益问题。创作者还可将作品永久存储在分布式存储平台Arweave上，保证作品的永久性存储。\n\n2）众筹（Crowdfunds）：\n\n众筹模块支持创作者进行任何形式内容的众筹，并且可以基于每个支持者的资助金额为支持者分发相应的支持者代币（由众筹发起者铸造），众筹前三名还可获得独特的NFT奖励。此代币可以理解为支持者所持有的股份，若作品铸造为NFT后出售获得了相应收益，可以此为基准进行相应的收益分配。而NFT则是项目社区成员的标志，从而自然而然的建立起一个DAO。\n\n3）收益拆分（Splits）：\n\n收益拆分模块支持创作者将作品收益或拍卖收益分发给其他多个实体，以此来与合作者共享共同作品的收益。拆分至少需要在两个账户地址之间进行，并且各实体之间的拆分百分比之和必须为100%。这样一来，在创作者提前预设好收益分配比例和规则之后，每一笔收益都将由智能合约自动完成收益分配的过程，避免中心化收益分配的不透明。\n\n4）NFT铸造（Editions）：\n\nEditions模块为Mirror的NFT铸造模块，用户可以使用此模块在Mirror上铸造NFT作品，其中包括价格、媒体文件（当前支持.jpg, .png, .gif, 和.mp4四类文件）、总供应量以及资金首款地址四个创作者自定参数。铸造好之后会生成该NFT地址，同时会加上相应的editionID，该地址可以直接嵌入Mirror的其他文章，在链接下方显示NFT。\n\n5）拍卖（Auctions）：\n\n通过拍卖板块，创作者可以将自己创作的NFT作品进行拍卖。创作者需要设定拍卖的保留价格和持续时间，每次出价应不小于上次价格的10%。拍卖同样可以创建对应的URL地址嵌入Entries模块之中，拍卖结束后的收益可以直接转入创作者设定的钱包地址，也可转入众筹或收益拆分模块。\n\n6）投票（Token Race）：\n\n投票功能服务于众筹之后所形成的DAO，其形式类似于Snapshot。众筹的参与者自然而然的组成了DAO，通过投票功能可以参与DAO的决策，实施社区的各类决议，在此基础上形成了创作者社区的能力闭环。\n\nMirror作为Web3.0最重要的内容创作平台之一，允许任何一个Web3.0用户在其中创作自己的作品，并围绕其开展各类活动。更重要的是，创作者自身完全拥有自己的创作作品，可以完全支配其作品而不受Mirror平台的影响。通过Crowdfunds，Splits和Token Race等模块，创作者可以创建属于每位社区成员的内容社区，并与成员共同建设属于每个人的社区。\n\n图片\n\n作为Web3.0前沿且理想主义的探索，Mirror所实现的方案仍有借鉴意义。\n\n3\\.3.2. Gitcoin：代码与资源的共享共治平台\n\n在传统网络世界中，如果你有个新奇的想法需要实现怎么办？设立一家公司去拿风投？在大公司争取个创新部门？去一个众筹平台？去车库咖啡碰碰运气？这些看起来都效率偏低，能不能有个平台让新奇的点子、投资者人和代码实现者之间架起桥梁？\n\nGitcoin是基于以太坊构建的去中心化协作平台，其为开发者提供了一个开发协作平台，同时为投资者提供了一个捐赠平台（加密货币捐赠）。可以简单理解为项目的代码和资金的众筹、共享平台。其核心功能主要有：\n\n1）赏金（Bounties）：\n\n该分区主要面向广大Web3.0开发者，开发者可通过发布赏金（Bounty）来针对指定问题寻求外部帮助，其他开发者可以通过解决该问题而获得赏金奖励。基于此，项目开发者可以更好的建设社区项目，而解决问题的开发者则可获得相应的奖励。\n\n2）黑客松（Hackathons）：\n\n该分区下集成有许多Hackathon项目，开发者可在此处加入由各个项目方所赞助的黑客松比赛，依照其主题开发相应的产品。\n\n3）捐赠（Grants）：\n\n在捐赠分区，用户可以向一些初创且具有公共物品性质的项目进行捐赠，捐赠结束后，部分项目可能会向捐赠用户给予空投回报。Gitcoin捐赠的核心创新在于二次方融资（Quadratic Funding）。在进行二次方融资时，项目所获资金为社区成员捐出资金的“平方根之和的平方”，即\n\n图片\n\n之后基金会将根据每个项目的社区二次方融资金额按比例进行配捐。如在一轮募资中共有两个项目Grant1与Grant2，Grant1获得来自10个人的1美金等值加密货币的捐赠，共计10美金。而Grant2获得来自1个人的10美金捐赠，共计也是10美金。此时若基金会配捐额度为1100美金，根据二次方融资公式，Grant1能获得的二次方融资票数为\n\n图片\n\n而Grant2能获得的二次方融资票数为图片。因此按照两个项目二次方融资的票数，Grant1所能获得的基金会配捐为图片，而Grant2所能获得的基金会配捐为图片\n\n这样一来，获得基金会配捐的往往是那些投票人数更多的项目，而并非投票金额最多的项目。一方面鼓励了更多用户参与捐赠投票，从而票选出公共服务性最强的项目。另一方面大大增加了骗取基金会配捐的成本，降低了配捐风险。\n\n图片\n\n4）探索（Quests）：\n\n该板块可以支持用户以一种游戏的方式去了解Web3.0世界以及各类生态系统，用户可以在题库中选择自己感兴趣的题目展开学习，之后以问答攻击的形式检验学习成果（每回答正确一题，系统生成的机器人会减少一滴血），击败机器人之后可获得相应的奖励，因此其本质为Learn2Earn的一种。\n\n图片\n\n5）荣誉（Kudos）：\n\nKudos是一种用户之间相互表达赞赏和建立关系的一种新方式。如用户A想通过Gitcoin向用户B表达感谢时，其可在Kudos市场购买荣誉勋章，将其赠送给用户A。（勋章本身可视作某种形式的NFT）\n\n图片\n\n6）学习（Kernal）：\n\nKernal是一个点对点学习社区，其通过由社区成员构建的八周课程，为想要深入理解Web3.0的用户提供了绝佳的平台，其内容包括以太坊发展历史、全球金融体系、代币经济学等多方面的知识。\n\nGitcoin为各类Web3.0初创项目以及想要进一步了解Web3.0的用户提供了最为友好的孵化平台和学习平台。对于项目而言，从黑客松的开始，到捐赠的发展，充满公共性的Web3.0项目在每一个用户的支持下发展，最后又回馈Web3.0用户。对于用户而言，在这里了解Web3.0，支持Web3.0，通过对项目的捐赠，共建Web3.0。在这里，每个人都能为Web3.0的建设贡献自己的力量，实现真正的共建、共享与共治。\n\n3\\.4. 元宇宙：Web3推动“现实世界”与“虚拟世界”的融合\n\nWeb3.0时代，元宇宙将是一个极富想象力和创造力的网络形态。Web2时代，人们习惯以“虚拟世界”和“现实世界”来作为线上线下世界的界限。构筑在Web3基础上的元宇宙，将是所谓“现实世界”和“虚拟世界”的深度融合。\n\nWeb2时代的互联网存在着明显的生态界限（这是由于中心化公司运作方式下的结果），一家互联网巨头控制住生态的核心准入，跨生态的应用是比较少的——例如在线支付工具跨生态的限制、重要互联网应用入口之间超链接的屏蔽。所谓的互联网应用，其实被限制在不同生态局域内的活动。而Web3时代的元宇宙世界，Web2时代的“鸿沟”和界限将被打破。\n\n除了上面章节提到的跨链应用解决了基于不同主链生态之间的融合之外，元宇宙世界与所谓的“现实世界”将不断融合。例如，一个元宇宙中的主体，除了在DeFi市场从事经济活动，也可以持有现实世界的资产权益。也就是说，元宇宙中的资产，并不存在“虚拟世界”账户与“现实世界”账户系统之间的隔离，元宇宙将是“现实世界”与“虚拟世界”的融合形态。一般会认为，元宇宙的世界虽然由用户共建，不同应用之间可以自由地通过各种手段打通融合，但元宇宙的虚拟世界无法与现实世界的资产账户打通，因为现实世界存在生态之间的隔离，所以“外部的元宇宙”更无法打入目前Web2时代的生态。基于DeFi的合成资产应用（如mirror（本节的mirror与3.3节项目重名，为不同项目）或synthetix），我们将看到如何以降维打击的模式将Web2世界的资产映射到Web3世界来。\n\n上线于2020年12月4日的Mirror Protocol（基于Terra公链）是一个可追踪股票、期货、交易所交易基金和其他传统金融资产价格的合成资产（Mirrored Assets，MmAssets）铸造平台——甚至可以将加密货币（比特币、以太坊等）映射到平台铸造代币的代币，MIR（Mirror Token）为平台的治理代币。用户可以通过超额抵押UST（TerraUSD，锚定美元的稳定币）或者已有的mAssets合成mAssets，不同的mAsset将会与不同的股票、期货、基金等资产的价格对应。赎回时，需要用户通过Mirror平台销毁铸造时产生的 mAssets，智能合约会收取一部分手续费并返还给用户铸造时抵押的 UST 或 mAssets。\n\n简单说，Mirror就是将传统金融市场（或者加密市场）的资产合成为Token的形式，映射到加密货币世界。比如，可以在Mirror平台上铸造特拉斯的股票通证——mTSLA，也可以讲ETH代币映射到Mirror平台——铸造mETH代币。实际上用户获得mAssets并不等同于购买了相对应的金融资产，所以也不存在股票分红等收益——但由于价格跟金融资产关联、且有抵押物支撑合成资产的价值，所以可以理解为合成资产可以获得对应金融资产的部分收益权，也可以将其类比为金融资产的期货（不可交割）。\n\n目前平台已经上线26种合成资产，包括特斯拉、苹果等股票和BTC、ETH等主流加密货币资产，以特斯拉股票代币为例，24小时流动性尝过1480万美元，交易量在百万美元级别，Mirror平台总流动性已经超过10亿美元。\n\n图片\n\n图片\n\nMirror平台上的个股价格是如何锚定真实现货市场？这就需要用到预言机机制，通过程序算法来链接两个市场的价格。具体详情请参与我们的报告《DeFi新金融（二）：超额抵押与资产映射》。\n\n类似Mirror或synthetix这类合成资产应用，相当于在Web2世界毫无感知的情况下，将资产映射到Web3世界。从这个意义上讲，基于Web3的元宇宙可以将“现实世界”资产融合进来。这也是Web3实现“开放”特点的例证。\n\n1. 向Web3.0流量价值新范式的演进\n\n互联网重要的流量（入口）价值，在Web3.0时代会是怎样的范式？\n\nWeb2.0争夺用户注意力和资金流量，从而实现流量价值变现。Web3.0时代，流量入口价值依旧重要，但绝不局限于此。\n\n例如，推动“DeFi Summer”的最大功臣之一的Uniswap，从面向用户的角度来说，同样想Web2.0一样的流量入口——用户利用其DEX协议完成交易兑换功能，用户支出的手续费作为协议（平台）的流量变现（其中一部分反馈给LP），站在这个角度看，Uniswap同Web2.0其他应用没什么本质区别。但作为基础DEX协议，Uniswap可以被其他协议调用，产生复合性特点（即所谓的DeFi乐高）。最典型的如收益机枪池、交易聚合器等应用，用户在这些应用上完成DeFi“挖矿”收益、交易兑换功能，其背后往往是调用Uniswap等DEX协议，而这些协议对用户来说是隐藏在背后的，而且中间可能隔了多个协议调用过程。但对于Uniswap基础协议流量变现来说，效果是一样的。\n\n由于Web3.0世界的开放性，这些调用不存在授权许可和生态界限等问题，完全是开放的。因此Web3.0的流量价值范式将呈现出开放化特点。另外，Web3.0流量价值还与协议调用的次数强相关。\n\n当前我们看到的众多社交（微信、微博）、娱乐（Steam）、金融（东方财富）等平台都是Web1.0向Web2.0演进中的受益者，未来向Web3.0演进形态是怎样的？\n\nWeb3.0充满了想象力，其最终的落地形态现在并不能清晰判断。但其趋势已然出现苗头。在向Web3.0演进过程中，有很多Web 2.0和Web 3.0混合的形态的产品出现。这方面典型的代表是NFT交易平台Opensea和Metamask钱包。Opensea的收入依靠NFT交易手续费，这类似传统的电商或者中心化交易所的模式。Metamask钱包有嵌入如Chrome等PC浏览器插件和手机app形式，作为重要的用户入口，Metamask集成了swap聚合功能，用户可以直接通过其调用DEX协议完成代币兑换，则额外付手续费给Metamask平台。这两者都是典型的Web 2.0产品。但用户在这两个平台上操作则是Web 3.0世界的典型产品或功能。\n\n2021年下半年随着NFT交易市场的火爆，Opensea进入交易额和交易量激增时期，8月单月交易额超过34亿美元。作为应用最为广泛的浏览器钱包插件，Metamask的流量入口价值得以体现，用户基于其使用swap交易额和平台手续费亦有较大增长。2021年9月30日交易额近4亿美元，平台手续费收入350万美元。\n\n图片\n\n图片\n\n这也许是目前最有意思的一个现象。用户基于对Web 3.0的信仰和向往，却化为Web 2.0商家的流量和收入。严格来说，Opensea和Metamask是再典型不过的Web 2.0产品，其流量变现模式极为简单和传统。NFT交易和DeFi挖矿，这些看似是Web 3.0世界的基础构成，却最终为Web 2.0产品创造了流量价值。也许正是因为这个原因，Elon Musk在其推特上提到：“有人看到过Web 3.0吗？我没有”。\n\n图片\n\n当然，这只是过渡时期的形态，也许这种形态要存在很长一段时间，但我们相信Web 3.0新的应用、新的产品逻辑和新的流量范式正在发生。\n\n从2D到3D？\n\n近期随着百度希壤、网易伏羲等发布，而三星也在Decentraland上构建虚拟商店，市场逐步关注3D数字世界。而从2D向3D的演进有望成为普通用户最触手可及的变化。以国盛区块链研究院在Decentraland中的虚拟总部为例，虚拟建筑本身相当于团队首页，可以展示研究产品和团队情况，当然也可以通过虚拟人进行交互。当需要路演时可在二楼路演大厅演示PPT或接入流媒体，观众可通过发放徽章NFT进行白名单管理。我们判断，在IT基础设施逐渐完备的基础上，2022年将有更多社交属性的流量将升级到3D。\n\n图片\n\n图片\n\n在传统Web2.0中，同时浏览首页的用户彼此之间并没有交互，而当进入3D世界后，社交欲望将更强，且通过NFT、皮肤等可以提高个体分辨度。我们认为，元宇宙的沉浸更多来自社交、分享和经济活动，而非限于AR/VR。从2D到3D就演进到Web3.0了？当然不是。这只是用户看到的界面升级，更深层次的是如何激励玩家进行创作、分享和交互。简言之，如果Roblox、TikTok没有经济激励，还会有那么多用户在其中进行游戏、短视频的内容创作吗？本质上，沉浸感的构建来自内部分享、创作带来的自我满足感和外部经济激烈的叠加。\n\n浏览器还是APP？\n\nWeb2.0时代，各类APP成为应用的主阵地，催生了买量、刷机等生意，用户的大量时间、数据被捆绑在头部APP中。而现存的Web 3.0应用，在PC端主要以web浏览器方式访问。手机端为web浏览器访问，钱包App也可以作为入口，但仍以web方式访问具体应用。不同于Web 2.0时代厂商喜欢开发独立的移动端App和PC客户端，Web 3.0也许将打破这一现象。App和客户端对于用户行为数据收集可能更为方便、也方便核心厂商对生态应用的管理（类似appstore那样的应用商店审核和管理），这一点在注重隐私和开发的Web 3.0时代将改变。也许Web 3.0正如其名字一样，web将作为一切应用的基础。\n\n1. Web3.0时代的监管思考\n\nWeb3.0带来的监管挑战无疑是巨大的，开放、隐私和共建的背景下，并非意味着Web3.0应用不需要监管。但毫无疑问，由于Web3.0应用业务模式的巨大革新，监管方式势必会产生大的变化以适应新事物的发展业态。\n\n因此，我们认为Web3.0时代，监管将呈现以下发展趋势：\n\n1）对于沟通Web3.0和Web2.0两个世界的通道/业务，将首当其冲，寻求适合的监管模式，以适应Web3.0的发展：\n\n例如稳定币作为传统世界财富进入Web3.0世界的重要通道，将最先产生监管行为。我们在《DeFi新金融（二）：超额抵押与资产映射》报告中层指出，长期而言，稳定币与现实经济世界融合是大趋势，稳定币是沟通两个世界财富的重要桥梁。\n\n稳定币目前最大问题在于与当下货币政策相冲突。很显然，稳定币在加密货币市场充当了“法币”的作用，某种程度上违反了当下各国的货币政策（同时还存在违反其他金融监管政策，如证券、期货等，甚至包括税收政策的可能），这也是加密货币资产的共同面临的问题。2020年11月，《中国金融稳定报告（2020）》首次提及稳定币（中国人民银行金融稳定分析小组，2020），2021年7月《中国数字人民币的研发进展白皮书》指出：有的商业机构计划推出全球性稳定币，将给国际货币体系、支付清算体系、货币政策、跨境资本流动管理等带来诸多风险和挑战，并将稳定币纳入虚拟币监管之列。\n\n但对全球市场而言，稳定币或将随着加密货币市场快速增长。因此未来一段时间，稳定币与监管的冲突将成为行业发展的大背景。最终结果，或许是创新与监管的相向而行，推动监管演进和迭代，在欧美等地率先出现加密货币市场与传统金融市场进一步融合，各国央行会将稳定币纳入货币监管体体系，未来的货币政策有可能包含了稳定币的政策。而这一切的前提是，先明确稳定币的监管定位——禁止使用、接纳为货币或视为新的金融产品，都是潜在的可能选择，这依据各国不同的市场情况来定。\n\n2）隐私和匿名方面，有可能存在底层实现KYC，应用层实现适度匿名：\n\n对于分布式网络带来的隐私和匿名功能，一方面存在隐私和匿名的需求，另一方面，并非隐私和匿名意味着会完全忽视监管。在现实世界中，监管必定存在，Web3.0亦将探索中与监管的融合之道。一种似乎可行的办法是：在区块链网络底层实现监管，意味着底层账户将存在着KYC等监管约束，而在中间协议层和应用层实现适度匿名。当然，监管的手段也是灵活的，用户KYC等信息可以存储在由监管参与的多签网络中。\n图片\n\n3）DAO治理过程中，势必会引入监管作为治理一方：\n\nDAO是Web3.0世界运行的重要的治理机制，但理想的的DAO方案似乎并不能解决所有问题，往往在需要仲裁、追讨被盗资产等问题发生后，现实社会政府机构和监管机构往往有着非常现实的作用。例如在DeFi系统经常发生的黑客攻击事件、以及其他难以预料事件导致的损失发生时，完全依靠DAO是不够的。这时候往往要借助现实社会政府和法律等手段解决。例如，当DeFi项目发生风险时，仅仅依靠社区的去中心化治理未必能够敦促开发团队保护或追回用户的加密资产。相反，在危机发生时，真正能够威慑到攻击者的，还是现实社会中的中心化机构和法律威慑。例如，当黑客的部分个人信息暴露以及部分资产被中心化机构所冻结时，黑客才愿意与开发团队谈判并承诺退回被盗的资产。例如，2021年8月Poly Network项目被盗事件中，被盗资金中最为安全的部分就是被稳定币发行公司Tether宣布冻结的3300万美元等值的资产——作为中心化公司，Tether拥有冻结链上USDT资产的权限。\n\n由此我们可以设想， DAO的治理，势必少不了现实社会监管机构的参与，监管机构作为DAO的治理一方似乎是非常理想的方案。\n\n风险提示\n\n区块链商业模式落地不及预期：Web3.0基于区块链、密码学等技术，相关技术和项目处于发展初期，存在商业模式落地不及预期的风险。\n\n监管政策的不确定性：Web3.0实际运行过程中涉及到多项金融、网络及其他监管政策，目前各国监管政策还处于研究和探索阶段，并没有一个成熟的监管模式，所以行业面临监管政策不确定性的风险。\n\n本文节选自国盛证券研究所已于2022年1月10日发布的报告《国盛区块链

{"id": "-rTh-HoakWujbq7BfdPZsvuDqooHFwba44FllzrBmcA", "title": "CAH Partner Petaverse Network will Create Virtual NFT Cats Based on Polygon", "body": "Great news from our partners, Petaverse Network has partnered with Polygon to create it one of the first chains of Petaverse Network pets, plus Polygon Studio has become a big supporter of the cross-chain digital pet vision! Concept Art House is also delighted with the breakthrough achievements of its partners. Let's learn more about the event below!\n\n \n\n[Petaverse Network](http://petaverse.network/), a non-fungible token (NFT) game company started by the founders of [Tiny Rebel Games](https://venturebeat.com/2022/03/03/tiny-rebel-games-raises-7m-to-build-the-petaverse-network/), will use the Polygon blockchain to mint its cute digital cats. It’s taking the gameplay of virtual pets — like the old Nintendogs game — and modernizing them based on blockchain and metaverse ideas. Susan Cummings and Lee Cummings, who have two decades of experience making games, started the Petaverse Network, which aims to combine games, XR, and web 3 to define an open standard for digital pets in the [metaverse](https://venturebeat.com/2020/05/05/just-how-close-are-we-to-achieving-the-metaverse/).\n\n \n\nThis is the first blockchain partnership for Petaverse Network, but it may not be the only one. Petaverse said the deal marks the first of many platforms Petaverse Network will partner with, powering its mission to become the first cross-chain platform for digital pets — beginning with the first drop of Petaverse Network cats this summer.\n\n \n\nWhile NFTs have run into lots of resistance among hardcore gamers, Susan Cummings believes that NFT titles with more gameplay and emotional connections will fare better, especially with broader mainstream audiences that include women players as well as men. \n\n \n\nPetaverse Network will also be supported by Polygon Studios, an organization for onboarding developers, brands, artists, and content creators to web 3 through investment, marketing, developer, and community support.\n\n \n\n“Polygon and Polygon Studios are committed to building a decentralized future so that everyone can have access to Web3 applications,” Brian Trunzo, metaverse lead at Polygon Studios, in a statement. “Through this partnership with Petaverse Network, we look forward to fostering growth amongst the Web3 community who are entering the metaverse through decentralized apps and taking their digital companions along too.”\n\n \n\n“We are incredibly excited to see this partnership come to fruition as we begin the Petaverse Network journey,” said Susan Cummings, CEO of Petaverse Network, in a statement. “As we continue to expand cross-chain support for multiple blockchains, it’s important that we focus on creating meaningful partnerships that support utility. Launching first on Polygon is a significant milestone as we deploy multi-chain support and we can’t wait to see what the future holds.”\n\n \n\n“We see this as a fundamental shift in how we think about pets, both physical and virtual. A pet that you can take with you in all variety of experiences and on all variety of devices and platforms, wherever you are in your lives,” she said. “A pet unconstrained by the laws of the physical world – one day a child allergic to dogs will put on AR glasses and have a pet ownership experience close to, but in some ways so much better, than owning a real pet.”\n\nCummings added, “Some day an older person will leave their home and pets to go into long-term care, and while their favorite cat has to be left behind, a digital twin can be at their side until the end. The idea of a persistent, resilient, re-interpretable pet, running behind you in a 3rd person shooter, sitting on your desk in AR, running around the bottom of your browser like a feline Clippy, just hanging out wherever you are, facilitated by a web 3 tech stack network, is the promise and the value to the user. How much a user cares about this will vary massively; but we’re betting those millions of Nintendogs owners, Tamagotchi owners, and Petz franchise owners will be excited by the idea of a persistent, breedable, provably ”theirs”, digital pet, with an ecosystem of games and experiences to take that pet into.”\n\n \n\nFor pet lovers, the company of pets must be hoped for a lifetime, and now thanks to blockchain, pets can really exist forever, no matter what form is chosen. After listening to Petaverse Network founder's description of digital pets, Concept Art House is also proud of what our partners have done, and looks forward to bringing you more surprises in future cooperation!", "timestamp": 1653272054, "digest": "wrPOC4_seASnlXeF4rwapOefY2MjSUdQBL-tCwqTBK8", "contributor": "0x5BCEFD7FadDFfc1B9259534075305Fd11d61C8FA"}

We Concept Art House couldn't help being proud of SkateX after we heard the news. Let’s chat with Curtis Chiu, Executive Producer about SkateX's growth, the process of making the game and where SkateX is headed.\n\nFor the majority of us, our first video game memories are centered around a specific console or PC title. For Chiu, however, his video game journey began at a pool hall. Chiu racked up an impressive resume full of video game bona fides at companies like Konami, Sega and Kabam before joining Block Tackle. \n\nChiu called the shots while working On SkateX, so he was very busy putting the game together, but he was able to take a few minutes to answer a few questions for On Deck. About his pool hall days, his passion for Sega, and why SkateX wasn't a simulator.\n\nRead Curtis Chiu's detailed interview with SkateX below.\n\n**Q:** What specific aspect of SkateX are you working on right now? \n\n**A:** Right now I’m reviewing art styles to see what kind of look and feel we want. Some options are more heavy lined and noir-ish to give a more dramatic effect. Other options are lighter art styles. Whichever way we choose, we want it to enhance the story and help people feel like they can express themselves. \n\nI’m also looking at potential storylines for the game. It’s crucial for people to feel super immersed in the game and get more enjoyment out of it. The story line will also keep people excited for future content, feature and game mode drops. \n\n**Q:** From the early NFT drops of things like skateboards with rockets, it’s obvious that SkateX will have an exaggerated feel to it. How “realistic” do you want SkateX to be?\n\n**A:** There are plenty of other skateboard games out there that provide simulation or a totally realistic feel. We want to bring something different to the audience. Something that has more entertainment value than just skating. Creating more of an exaggerated environment also allows us to scale in different ways than just adding new parks and cities. We can do more content, different modes and create a more open ended experience for the players. \n\n**Q:** Part of the fun of skateboarding in real life is the freedom that comes with it and hanging out with your friends. How will players connect and hang out in the world of SkateX?\n\n**A:** SkateX will have a central hub where everybody can congregate and interact in lots of ways with their friends. We’ll also be adding stuff like emojis and mini games where people can cooperate with others. We really want to make sure there are a lot of ways people can positively interact with one another. \n\n**Q:** What other activities will SkateX do next?\n\n**A:** A lot of people in the community have been asking about this and yes – Staking is coming. That’s all I can say right now.\n\nThis is the latest information about SkateX and if you want to learn more,please check out SkateX's official website and Twitter for more highlights. Concept Art House is also looking forward to more surprises SkateX will bring us in the future!", "timestamp": 1653272132, "digest": "gV6Opfy_CHixHij3gLi1XDxFxu5zf33sFhdL6PSHeDA", "contributor": "0x5BCEFD7FadDFfc1B9259534075305Fd11d61C8FA"}
{"id": "QM5WmYuCBEpjEk3sEEhZtxmtLHzTZGM8E367cw0U-2g", "title": "Concept Art House Partners AzraGames Raises $15M to Bring Web3 Gaming Mainstream", "body": "Congrats to our friends @AzraGames for raising $15M to bring Web3 gaming to mainstream gamers!\n\n \n\n[Azra Games](https://azragames.com/), a blockchain games company aimed at building mainstream collectible and combat RPGs for the [Web3 ](https://venturebeat.com/2022/05/18/n3twork-studios-raises-46m-to-make-web-3-games/)era, has raised $15 million in funding.\n\n \n\nThe company is run by Mark Otero, former general manager of EA Capital Games, general manager of Bioware, and CEO and co-founder of the highly successful gaming startup KlickNation (acquired by ElectronicArts) . He has a strong passion for core games and has released eight collectible and combat RPGs. His last game, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, has grossed over $1 billion and has been EA's top mobile game for six years.\n\n \n\nMark Otero said: \"Our mission is to create games that rekindle the joys of childhood play. Imagine leading terrifying monsters, giant robots and heroic heroes to battle insane foes in a game full of risk and reward. Imagine a A vibrant marketplace and a sustainable gaming economy based on real value that only Web3 can unlock to deliver the most engaging and complete gaming experience. That's what we're building.\"\n\n \n\nAndreessen Horowitz (from the newly announced Gaming Fund and their crypto fund) led the round, with participation from NFX, Coinbase Ventures, Play Ventures, and Franklin Templeton.\n\n \n\nIn an exclusive interview with GamesBeat, Otero said Azra Games is on a mission to create deep, immersive game universes, with a specialized in-game economy and virtual collectibles, powered by Web3 technology such as non-fungbile tokens (NFTs). This seed funding will be used to accelerate development on Azra’s first game – an epic, fantastical collectibles and mass combat RPG titled Project Arcanas.\n\n \n\nOtero is working with fellow entrepreneurs Sonny Mayugba and Travis Boudreaux. The company has also hired veterans from Capital Games. Their new title must be exciting as Electronic Arts recently announced that those who stayed at Capital Games are working on a pretty exciting mobile game based on [The Lord of the Rings franchise](https://venturebeat.com/2022/05/09/electronic-arts-unveils-mobile-game-the-lord-of-the-rings-heroes-of-middle-earth/).\n\n \n\nOtero said Azra Games is re-imagining the delights of collecting toys and limited edition items through a dedicated NFT ecosystem. Azra’s first game will be prolific gamemaker Otero’s ninth in collectible and combat RPGs, as he is joined by a veteran game team with a deep history in the genre. Otero hopes the team's credibility will help it succeed in NFT-based games. That's why the company started funding from a solid gaming VC rather than an NFT token sale.\n\n \n\nAs for the specific type of blockchain technology the company will use, Otero said in an interview, \"We're taking it slow and we're not in a rush to nail down the technology stack at the moment, and that's because we're focusing on high-quality gameplay first. Our The goal is to create a genre-defining game for the RPG space. Blockchain is really going to amplify that experience. What we need is technology that enhances the experience, not making games, so we're just religiously focused on gameplay.\"\n\n \n\nIn fact, the hardest thing is to build a fun game, but once you do, it will retain users, and they will want to keep playing the game. Therefore, the assets within the game itself have immediate utility. And so really, utility of the asset is really the function of the quality and fun of the game. \n\n \n\nWe are amazed at Otero's deep knowledge of various game industries, and also believe that under Otero's leadership, the different trade-offs between blockchain or partner type evaluation and available technologies will be carefully weighed. Concept Art House looks forward to Azra Games in the region.

3.0更类似Web 1.0的去中心化基础架构，基于区块链和Token经济体系，其应用架构、治理结构等都呈现去中心化状态。此外，由于Web3.0核心应用开源性，其在体系内复制、开辟新应用门槛较低，可能较难形成Web2.0时代的超级平台对行业形成垄断的态势。\n\n图表：Web1.0、Web2.0、Web3.0的性质对比\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ffCUPZ3urq-yXFDoovxNP.png?height=578&width=1080)\n\n资料来源：Grayscale，中金公司研究部\n\n**Web3.0处于早期发展，但势头好**\n\nWeb3.0目前发展势头猛，但发展阶段早。Web3.0在2021年元宇宙概念获得关注之际获得了大量的融资，根据CB insights数据显示，2021年全球区块链初创企业融资金额达252亿美元，同比增长超700%。强大的资金流意味着强大的人才流，同时Web3.0的使用者在快速增长，因此Web3.0同时具备了供给端和需求端的增长动力。但相比于成熟2.0时代大厂，Web3.0不论从用户规模还是市值来看仍然较小，属于成长早期阶段：目前Web3.0中用户最多的是数字货币使用者，约3亿人，距离[Facebook](https://www.jinglingshuju.com/data/item/5c82713826a65677e33d2291fce38df5)的MAU（29亿人）仍有较大差距；其次是DeFi、NFT，均在百万人次的量级。\n\n图表：全球区块链初创企业融资金额\n\n

Topics，Dune，中金公司研究部注：时间截止2021年12月31日\n\n## Web3.0基础设施：高楼平地起\n\n一个产业繁荣发展，基础设施是必要条件，就像PC互联网以Windows系统普及、移动互联网发展以iPhone等智能终端以及iOS和安卓等操作系统普及为开端一样，Web3.0发展也离不开基础设施的建立和普及。本章，我们将对区块链（含公链）、智能合约、Oracle、DAO、Token等基础设施进行阐释。我们谈及Web3.0的“基础设施”，可能是比20年前互联网更令人费解的一个概念，它既没有和现实物理世界的一一对应（类似电商之于零售、外卖之于饮食等），也没有处理器、二进制等我们早已熟悉的概念，某种程度上，Web3.0没有物理性的基础，它的基础设施，就是人与人之间的互动合作关系，甚至就是社会本身。\n\n接下来，我们将分别介绍区块链、DAO、Smart Contract、Oracle、Token等概念，虽然由于应用的贫乏，看起来还处于发展早期阶段，但作为一套新秩序，框架已然清晰，这将是未来应用生态开始演进的基础。总结来看，我们认为Web3.0的基础设施公链、DAO、Token机制等已经初步体系化，但是却远远谈不上成熟，一方面，相关设施仍然存在例如效率较低（例如交易效率），另一方面， 其背后底层机制设置（例如DAO决策机制等）仍然处于初步阶段，行业发展仍然需要不同领域的专业人才共同参与（而不仅仅是技术人才），支持行业走上可持续发展道路。\n\n**区块链（Blockchain）：Web3.0的底层架构，公链蓬勃发展**\n\n相比于传统的网络，区块链核心特点：去中心化和安全性。区块链（Chain of Blocks or Blockchain）是由一个个区块连接在一起组成的链条，每一个区块中保存了一定的信息，并按照各自产生的时间顺序连接而成。每一个区块都包含了前一个区块的Hash值，从而保证连接的精准性。整个链条被保存在所有节点中，系统中的服务器为整个区块链系统提供存储空间和算力支持。并且，区块链上的任何一个网络节点都存储着一样的数据，任何一个节点对文件修改（比如交易）都需要半数以上的节点确认同意（consensus)，信息一旦发生变动链上的其他人都会知道。因此篡改区块链中的信息是一件极其困难的事，理论上节点的数量越多，去中心化程度就越高。\n\n区块链基于密码学的设计，提供了一种新的社会关系——在一个陌生人社会中，因为人与人的互动是记录在一个不可篡改的公开账本中，从而使得陌生人也可以在零信任基础的条件下展开合作，而不是落入囚徒困境的博弈中。\n\n**图表：区块链中区块的连接方式（每一个区块包含了前一个区块的Hash值）**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6kK8DLO9cQ08JfzjBeJrM.png?height=479&width=1080)\n\n资料来源：Shermin Voshmgir《Token Economy: How the Web3 reinvents the Internet》(2020)，中金公司研究部\n\nWeb3.0“不可能三角”：去中心化（公开透明）、安全、效率。正如货币政策“不可能三角”一样，以区块链为基础架构的Web3.0也存在去中心化、安全和效率“不可能三角”。传统意义上，任何一个体系都应该拥有足够的安全性，而Web3.0又强调去中心化特征，由此，其效率较低问题也开始凸显——效率指每秒处理交易的笔数（TPS）。这也是造成区块链性能低下的主要原因——去中心化导致每笔交易都要在所有节点上达成一致。所以，解决效率低的问题只能另辟蹊径，如off chain（链下合约/决策）、side chain（侧链）等。但越复杂的机制由于开源的特性，越容易带来潜在安全漏洞，从而招致黑客的攻击。主流区块链比特币、以太坊、EOS 都在“不可能三角”的某个特性上做了一定妥协。\n\n图表：主链的不可能三角\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g8zbOWnFHLLh_GQSbgWoT.png?height=473&width=755)\n\n资料来源：电子发烧友，中金公司研究部\n\n**公链（Public Blockchain）：平台型底座，降低应用开发门槛**\n\n区块链可以分为公链、私链等。公链指任何人都有权限读取、发送且获得有效确认的共识区块链，因此公链通常被认为是“完全去中心化”的，其无需注册、授权便可匿名访问网络，具有中立、开放、不可篡改等特点。最早的公链是比特币（采用POW共识机制），除此以外知名公链项目有Ethereum（POW，后续会改为POS）、Binance（POA）、Solana（POS+POH）等，FTX（POS）。公链一般会通过项目本身的Token来鼓励参与者竞争记账，来确保数据的安全性。除公链外，还有需要验证进入的私链，其中又包括存在多个等权力中心的联盟链。\n\n公链的作用在于为应用提供平台，降低应用开发门槛。不是所有应用都能够或者有必要去自己构建一个区块链（要有足够数量节点才能保证安全性），而公链则类似于一种平台性的产品，支持任何人在平台中建立和使用通过区块链技术运行的去中心化应用，允许用户按照自己的意愿创建复杂的操作，为开发去中心化应用提供底层的模板。由于不同公链在性能设计、共识机制、营销策略等方面有差异，不同应用在选择公链落脚时主要考虑交易费率、交易效率（如TPS）、便捷度（如跨链协议）、生态成熟度等情况。\n\n图表：知名公链各项情况对比\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MWrb6Wxi9whf1ey4_pdQs.png?height=259&width=1080)\n\n资料来源：Messari，Blockchair，公司官网，CSDN，中金公司研究部；注：TPS为2022年4月29日数据\n\n**Ethereum：“去中心化应用”时代开创者**\n\n以太坊（Ethereum）是一个开源的有智能合约功能的公共区块链平台，通过专用[加密货币](javascript:void(0);)以太币（Ether，简称“ETH”）提供去中心化的以太虚拟机（Ethereum

Machine）来处理点对点合约。以太币(ETH)是目前市值第二高的[加密货币](javascript:void(0);)，仅次于比特币。\n\n以太坊是各类应用孵化的摇篮。以太坊源起于比特币主链上无法构建高级应用这一缺点，因此其诞生之日从设计上就是为了解决去中心化应用开发难的情况。目前，以太坊的生态是各大公链生态中发展最迅速的之一。\n\n图表：以太坊应用生态图谱\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cmGUI4LyeB3Vmf6T5CVj_.png?height=516&width=1080)\n\n资料来源：Ethereum，中金公司研究部\n\n以太坊2.0或将带来重大变化。目前以太坊与比特币采用同样的POW共识机制，虽然POW在去中心化和安全性上比较可靠，但是在效率（涉及高额的交易费）、节能性（能耗过大，不环保）以及扩展性上有较大的问题。因此以太坊2.0有几点变化：1.将从POW转向POS共识机制（允许验证者通过质押治理Token来验证）；2.分片将数据库横向分割；3.引入eWASM以取代EVM（允许开发者使用C++、Rust等简单语言编程），以实现降低Gas费、提高网络吞吐量（可增加至2000+）、降低硬件要求、扩展以太坊生态系统、减少碳足迹等目的。\n\n**长安链：来自我国的联盟链**\n\n长安链·ChainMaker是新一代区块链开源底层软件平台，本质是联盟链（无代币，在公开透明性上逊于公链），包含区块链核心框架、组件库和工具集，由北京微芯研究院、清华大学、北京航空航天大学、[腾讯](https://www.jinglingshuju.com/data/item/c974c28926e900690a564f1c9c7bcd0b)、[百度](https://www.jinglingshuju.com/data/item/fd05aabe8ff009ce2452f115ef89b2ca)和[京东](https://www.jinglingshuju.com/data/item/1df61b33e63e8b5ee56a719adb6e724a)等知名高校、企业共同研发。与其他公链相比，联盟链因节点数量有限而实现高速的交易，但一定程度上也抛弃了完全去中心化的特性（非完全公开）。另外，长安链与公链一样有共识投票机制，但并非采用传统公链的POW或POS机制，也没有自己的Token，而是采用了Solo、Raft、TBFT、HotStuff四种共识类型（根据不同场景和参与的节点数量规模，运用不同的共识）。\n\n图表：长安链生态体系\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rSGt8HOXr0eugkiMcIABZ.png?height=587&width=1080)\n\n资料来源：CCTV13（https://chainmaker.org.cn/），中金公司研究部\n\n**智能合约（Smart Contract）：基于代码的执行环节**\n\n当一帮互相不认识的人在一起时候，如何达成一致？传统模式通过中介平台撮合和担保达成一致。而Web3.0时代则可以通过基于算法的智能合约，即Smart Contract。\n\nSmart Contract是满足特定条件下在区块链上执行代码的程序。其本质是一系列代码的合集（具有自动化、不逆转性、代码公开透明性等特点），各方以数字签署合同的方式准许并维护其运行，用于自动完成某些特定的功能（如汇款、买卖虚拟NFT商品等）。智能合约潜在形象比喻可以是一台自动售货机，它更像一个执行某种功能的“程序黑盒”，用户扫码付钱，选择商品，然后拿走商品，完成购买。\n\n►优点：相比传统中介平台，Smart Contract可显著降低达成一致意见和操作的成本，允许区块链在没有中介的情况下进行可信交易，某种程度上具备替代律师、Broker中介等职业的可能性。\n\n►缺点：安全性仍要持续加强，其功能局限于代码（代码本身有可能存在错误，导致被黑客攻击），也就是写代码的人，典型例子为The DAO被攻击事件——黑客发现了以太坊智能合约中代码的漏洞，盗取大量ETH，最终以太坊只能采用硬分叉来尽力保护用户资产。\n\n图表：智能合约可比喻为一台自动售货机\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TEVqrnX5623A-wnHJX7Qg.png?height=331&width=1020)\n\n资料来源：Shermin Voshmgir《Token Economy: How the Web3 reinvents the Internet》(2020)，中金公司研究部\n\nOracle：链上和链下数据的“桥梁”。Oracle是一个为区块链项目提供真实世界数据服务的中间件。由于智能合约很多时候面临线下和线上数据相结合的问题，Oracle就是“桥梁”，其中的“游客”包括软件、硬件、输入、输出等设备和代码。典型案例有Chainlink项目，其为DeFi在去中心化的模式下创造了丰富的数据环境，通过聚合多个链下市场数据源，核心解决Oracle本身的信任机制问题。\n\n**DAO（Decentralized Autonomous Organizations）：去中心化组织形式**\n\nDAO是去中心化组织的一种组织形式，其对应Web2.0时代的公司，本质是对公司、政府这种组织形式的革新。相比于传统公司，DAO首先解决传统的“代理人困境”难点，DAO不存在代理人，它将执行交给Smart Contract，将治理权给予股东的直接投票机制（比如决定其公司决策机制的Protocol）。同时，DAO也是对传统公司管理形式的革新——其基于专业分工、代码、共识机制等方式将生态各参与方整合起来成为一个新的组织，承担原有公司化的职能，典型案例如CultDAO。最后，疫情趋势下，“远程办公”正在成为某种不可逆的趋势，而DAO则有希望和“远程办公”趋势协同发展。\n\n图表：DAO是对传统“自上而下”组织结构的颠覆\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MAF8yOj50iZL1rCJZTXO1.png?height=403&width=1080)\n\n资料来源：Shermin Voshmgir《Token Economy: How the Web3 reinvents the Internet》(2020)，中金公司研究部\n\n在DAO社区中决策机制通常分为链上和链下。Smart Contract只能执行现有代码，而DAO需要持续更新，这背后就需要一套决策机制，持续更新DAO的运行规则。链上决策就是指由成员提出议案，社区进行投票表决。按照区块链的性质，理论上链上决策才是唯一的路径，然而弱点是效率太低（需要经过区块链大部分节点同意），同时因为投票权掌握在Token更多的成员手中，容易引发中心化问题（事情本身是去中心化的，但是Token持有的份额导致了中心化）。针对链上效率低的问题，有时成员会进行链下决策——在其他社交平台充分讨论议案后进行决策，但缺点是讨论本身也可以被利益左右的人引导。作为一种完整的组织形式，DAO内部存在相对应的财政和货币政策。财政政策通常与代币的总供给相关，而货币政策通常与交易成本挂钩，而交易成本通常由主链TPS决定。\n\nDAO目前仍处于探索阶段，存在诸多问题。首先是安全性问题，案例为The DAO，2016年其基于Ethereum建立去中心化的量化基金，最初发行了1.5亿美元募资。然而由于代码漏洞，The DAO的社区成员被偷走了5000万美元价值的ETH，最后以Ethereum强行硬分叉告终，以尽量减少用户损失。这也说明了DAO这种理想型治理结构的初级发展阶段（稚嫩期）。其次是相应人才的缺失问题，DAO背后的机制设计需要经济学、社会学、政治学等相关专业知识，目前主要参与者仍然以技术背景为主，导致机制设计仍存在诸多不完善之处。\n\n图表：链上或链下决策机制\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oEPYReenYkAgLvgtH9nch.png?height=364&width=806)\n\n资料来源：Shermin

Internet》(2020)，中金公司研究部\n\n**代币（Token）：Web3.0的“原子”基础单位**\n\nToken是区块链权益载体的基础单位。区块链的机制是把人与人的互动记录在一个不可篡改的公开账本中，但记账是要花成本的，为了激励，记账的人可以获得Token作为奖励，Token是区块链的基本组成单位。以Bitcoin为例，Token代表在Blockchain的一个入口，只有持有Wallet私钥才能够进入。而Bitcoin的挖矿就指代矿工通过矿机运算，消耗的算力被给予一定的报酬（即Token，比特币），这就是POW的共识机制。从技术角度来看，Token属性可以分类为原生Token（比如ETH）和衍生Token（比如ERC-20）。从可分性角度，Token可以分成可分型（例如比特币）和不可分型（Non Fungible Token，也即NFT）。\n\nToken是一种所有权的象征，而这种象征可以代表资产、权力等。其中资产型Token可分为证券型Token、集体所有权Token和代表艺术收藏品的Token（如NFT）。\n\n可以说，好的制度绝不是建立在对人性的考验上，而是找到制度与利益的统一之处。Token和公链是不可分割的存在，没有链就不会衍生出Token，没有Token就没有人记账，那这个链也无法建立信任。\n\n图表：资产型Token概述\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wTl9e_8tzaUMkGuyiOMFn.png?height=530&width=1080)\n\n资料来源：Shermin Voshmgir《Token Economy: How the Web3 reinvents the Internet》(2020)，中金公司研究部\n\n除代表资产外，Token体系本身可以用来实现某些目的（Purpose-Driven），例如激励用户。Purpose-Driven Token背后对应的是一整套激励体制的设计和建设，是经济学、数学、社会学等多学科的综合问题，与社会治理体系设计相类似。类似DAO的决策机制，激励Token的机制设计目前仍然处于初级阶段，存在诸多不完善之处。\n\nToken激励的潜在风险。Token激励机制是Web3.0应用中的重要一环，然而，其匿名属性以及类似众筹的属性也带来潜在的过度投机、洗钱等风险。由此，如何对Token发行机制进行有效监管成为全球各国监管机构面对的首要问题。目前来看，Know Your Customer (KYC)，即对交易账户进行实名，以及反洗钱等条例已经基本成为监管正规化的底线。而相对来说，中国监管机构则选择禁止Token代币机制设计，其出发点则是防范过度投机炒作，对普通投资者和用户进行保护。\n\n## Web3.0应用展望：无边光景一时新\n\nWeb3.0的破圈须仰仗丰富的应用。正如前文所言，Web3.0基础设施目前已经相对完善，但其更大规模的破圈还需要应用生态的发展。基于“跨越鸿沟”理论来看，我们认为Web3.0整体生态目前正处于从“创新者”迈入“早期采用者”的跨越时期，创新者基于区块链、Token经济等先进技术青睐进入这个行业，而早期采用者则基于对产品本身能够带来巨变而进入行业，而这背后就需要“划时代”级别单个重量级应用出现。而再往下一层，行业将“跨越鸿沟”，其决定标准则是能否提供针对某些特定问题完善整体产品解决方案（完整生态）。\n\n总结来看，我们认为应用生态是Web3.0是否能够进军大众市场的关键要素。当下来看，在现有应用中，DeFi、NFT是相对成熟的，主要原因是其衍生自Web3.0应用自带的经济体系，由此DeFi某种程度是Web3.0生态的基础应用（比如[交易所](javascript:void(0);)是当下行业最重要“流量入口”）。其次，NFT则凭借数字资产浪潮吸引大量关注度，但仍处于早期。仍然存在大量投机风险。GameFi则凭借[游戏](javascript:void(0);)受众广，盈利能力强等属性有望成为下一个应用增长点，Axie Infinity和StepN等应用展现一定潜力。最后SocialFi等其他方向还在探索期。如何平衡经济体系和行业娱乐属性，是GameFi和SocialFi等社交娱乐应用设计者需要重点突破问题之一。\n\n图表：Web3.0目前正在从创新者往早期采用者跨越的区间\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lsaLL1Kum6rDcfhsbPscT.png?height=722&width=1012)\n\n资料来源：Geoffrey A. Moore 《Crossing the Chasm》(2009)，中金公司研究部\n\n**DeFi：重要基础应用，发展相对成熟**\n\nDeFi（去中心化金融）是Web 3.0重要的基础应用。DeFi，崛起于2017年（以Ethereum应用生态的出现为起点），是以区块链技术为核心的去中心化金融体系，一切过程都由智能合约自动完成，而不需要像传统金融市场那样依赖金融中介进行交易。由于Web3.0应用生态自带经济体系，所以其需要对应金融系统支持运转，由此，DeFi是Web3.0重要基础型应用。此外，因为DeFi的所有信息是储存在区块链上的，所以DeFi也具有公开透明性和可追溯性等特点。基于POS的机制，DeFi的整体锁仓量（押金）从2017年起逐渐抬升，至2021年11月达到最高峰（约1090亿美元），显示出行业在迅速发展。\n\n图表：DeFi整体锁仓量（十亿美元）\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0xJNF0lB37ET6bS6tgl1r.png?height=415&width=765)\n\n资料来源：DeFi

Metrics，中金公司研究部\n\n对标传统金融体系，DeFi已经构建相对完善的体系。目前，DeFi体系中的各项基础功能均已就位——包括加密货币、[交易所](javascript:void(0);)、借贷功能、融资功能等。\n\n总的来说，DeFi体系的核心由加密资产和交易系统两部分组成，借贷、融资等其他类型平台则围绕这两个部分搭建。其中，加密资产可以分为非同质化货币和同质化货币两个类型——非同质化代币（Non-Fungible Tokens）即NFT，而同质化代币又包含类似比特币、以太币的区块链原生币，以及以ERC-20 Token为代表的链上衍生币。交易系统是用户进行加密资产交易的场所，根据是否由智能合约自动完成交易分为去中心化交易所和中心化交易所。实际上，目前交易所是Web3.0应用生态最大的“流量入口”，核心原因是各种加密资产交易需求是当下行业最广泛需求。虽然部分交易所也能实现借贷等功能，但一些实现特定功能的平台还是随着用户多样化的需求应运而生，例如借贷、融资等平台，也是DeFi体系不可或缺的一部分。\n\n图表：DeFi系统结构\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6tfuPfj0FF-yBxVZtjH6B.png?height=757&width=1049)\n\n资料来源：Shermin

►区块链原生币：拥有自己的主链，占据了加密货币市值的绝大部分，也是所有DeFi交易中不可或缺的元素，例如在比特币区块链上进行的交易需要支付一定的比特币作为矿工费，在以太坊上进行的交易则需要支付一定的以太币作为Gas费。 ►链上衍生币：这些加密货币是遵循一些协议在某些区块链主链上二次开发生成的，例如以太坊上的ERC-20 Tokens（USDC、Tether）。 与传统货币相比，以比特币为代表的加密货币资产最大的问题就是币值波动较大，而稳定币则是通过一些特殊结构实现价值稳定的加密货币，从而为整个DeFi体系增加币值稳定的加密货币基础设施。按照不同的稳定结构，可分为央行发布的数字货币；资产抵押的稳定币（例如USDT，用美元做抵押物）；利用加密资产做抵押的稳定币（例如DAI，用ETH做抵押）；还有算法稳定币（例如UST）等。目前来看，抵押物是否充足、算法是否稳定等问题都是决定“稳定币是否真的稳定”的核心关键，仍有待完善。

Book Method），对想要交易的多方进行撮合。具体的机制为，用户在一个中心化交易所开户后，交易所会自动生成几个地址分配给用户，但是私钥由交易所管理。用户将交易需求告诉交易所后，交易所再代理用户进行加密资产交易，典型案例为Binance、Coinbase等。\n\n**►去中心化交易所（DEX）：**类似自动售货机，用户可以在智能合约的辅助下自主完成整个交易过程，而不必将其资金的控制权交给任何中介或托管人，典型案例为Uniswap等。\n\n图表：中心化交易所和去中心化交易所对比\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SmRjqp0WNJZIwvc8Kzwsv.png?height=296&width=1080)\n\n资料来源：Coinbase年报，dYdX官网，Messari，中金公司研究部；注：随着交易额度的上升，吃单费和挂单费都会梯度下降，这里只取最低档水平来进行对比\n\n目前交易所以Binance交易量为首。Binance（代币为BNB）是华裔加拿大人赵长鹏于2017年建立在中国的一个中心化交易所，中国加强对加密资产的监管后迁往海外。2019年美国也禁止了Binance的运行，于是推出了专供美国使用的Binance

可能也是一种选择**\n\n相对而言，Web3.0领域的动作更清晰，布局也更迅速。基于Oculus主推的元互联网，对于Web3.0来说已经是对Web3.0的拥抱了。此外，Alphabet 区块链也因为各个区块链，研究建立了双边关系和数据存储技术。具体而言，国内监管和监管相对开放，互联网大厂Web3.0更多围绕监管相对开放区块链、数字藏品等展开。另外，公司在海外市场也进行了相关的投资布局。\n\n图：海外互联网大厂对Web3.0的布局\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a8px6bXzwyW_w7oVOrgia.png?height=871&width=1080)\n\n资料来源：36氪，律动，中金公司研究部\n\n图表：实现互联网大厂对Web3.0的布局\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EkCdvo0m2C6Ak96ssbZ7p.png?height=307&width=1080)\n\n资料来源：36氪，律动，中金公司研究部\n\n风险提示：监管的流入或正轨进入Web3.0发展\n\n正视Web3.0的风险——技术发展的两面性\n\n任何技术带来的机遇同时也会带来风险，总结一下，我们认为 Web3.0 时代可能主要存在以下风险：\n\n►这些货币收紧资产。然而，美国的货币政策带来的利益可能带来一些新的资产，加密货币是投资者的考虑进入的资产。周期性，加密资产盘的价格可能会出现，从而导致加密资产的价格出现。\n\n► 匿名机制带来的程度也和广告宣传、偷漏等风险。去化化交易等属性虽然会降低成本中心，但一定会带来潜在的漏税以及漏税交易等风险。因此，对于交易的实名制，以及增加交易可追踪性等是行业发展的必要条件之一。\n\n►代币机制可能伤害投资者等风险。代币机制渗入到Web3市场的方方面面，而其背后的生态不同方面的激励代币以及随之带来的金融价值（如证券），带来必然波动和投机，这种活动可能对普通用户（投资者）带来潜在的伤害，类似众筹或集资。\n\n►技术、机制设置漏洞等风险。发展初期，可能在技术问题不足、技术设计不适合行业等方面，而背后的经济价值必然带来冲击，可能带来潜在的损失，此外，德金融金融存在潜在风险。最近的新出现，可能会越来越复杂，对于任何一个市场动向的市场风险都可能牵头牵头金融市场。因此，不同的金融资产，应该存在一定的监管。\n\nWeb3.0的监管：中美预测，预测会不断完善\n\n正进入该行业的监管部门是行业发展所必需的条件。提到Web3.0带来的潜在风险，更高层次的监管。实践中，环境监管完善了监管，也发展了行业发展目前看来，中美两国监管谨慎，其中包括货币等货币的态度。\n\n►中国：未来对区块链技术有导向性的政策，认为该技术能够推动未来科技的发展。 ：DeFi 方面，让对代币发行以及、代币（涉及市场）等允许金融交易的交易活动全面禁止发行；NFT 方面，将确保 NFT 的发行，但不作作。\n\n►美国早期：的状态监管比较迷迷茫的，2020年严格监管对资产加密进行了划分并按照类别机构（其中以SEC最为普遍），监管实施口比一定要大，不禁止代币发行、融资、交易（的集中监管在ICO和代币化上），更加令监管更加宽松。本次证券交易日拜登签署了行政，未来美国针对Web3.0的监管会的可能消费者和投资者的保护、稳定和不融资等问题。\n\n►其他：各国的监管大风险都集中在加密资产币上，尤其是部分证券化代，同时大多数国家会基于关注与关注关注相关融资企业。 （如日本、新加坡、韩国等）。\n\n本文作者：肖衍衍白洋钱凯，本文来源：中金点睛，译文标题：《中金 | 元宇宙系列之Web3.0：新范式开启互联网新阶段》", "timestamp": 1653272516, "digest": "XkEbKG6mLuzR7_Gd5OSjq39udSLAEcM1ndVrHAuXNE8", "contributor":

He has a strong passion for core games and has released eight collectible and combat RPGs. His last game, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, has grossed over $1 billion and has been EA's top mobile game for six years.\n\n \n\nMark Otero said: \"Our mission is to create games that rekindle the joys of childhood play. Imagine leading terrifying monsters, giant robots and heroic heroes to battle insane foes in a game full of risk and reward. Imagine a A vibrant marketplace and a sustainable gaming economy based on real value that only Web3 can unlock to deliver the most engaging and complete gaming experience. That's what we're building.\"\n\n \n\nAndreessen Horowitz (from the newly announced Gaming Fund and their crypto fund) led the round, with participation from NFX, Coinbase Ventures, Play Ventures, and Franklin Templeton.\n\n \n\nIn an exclusive interview with GamesBeat, Otero said Azra Games is on a mission to create deep, immersive game universes, with a specialized in-game economy and virtual collectibles, powered by Web3 technology such as non-fungbile tokens (NFTs). This seed funding will be used to accelerate development on Azra’s first game – an epic, fantastical collectibles and mass combat RPG titled Project Arcanas.\n\n \n\nOtero is working with fellow entrepreneurs Sonny Mayugba and Travis Boudreaux. The company has also hired veterans from Capital Games. Their new title must be exciting as Electronic Arts recently announced that those who stayed at Capital Games are working on a pretty exciting mobile game based on [The Lord of the Rings franchise](https://venturebeat.com/2022/05/09/electronic-arts-unveils-mobile-game-the-lord-of-the-rings-heroes-of-middle-earth/).\n\n \n\nOtero said Azra Games is re-imagining the delights of collecting toys and limited edition items through a dedicated NFT ecosystem. Azra’s first game will be prolific gamemaker Otero’s ninth in collectible and combat RPGs, as he is joined by a veteran game team with a deep history in the genre. Otero hopes the team's credibility will help it succeed in NFT-based games. That's why the company started funding from a solid gaming VC rather than an NFT token sale.\n\n \n\nAs for the specific type of blockchain technology the company will use, Otero said in an interview, \"We're taking it slow and we're not in a rush to nail down the technology stack at the moment, and that's because we're focusing on high-quality gameplay first. Our The goal is to create a genre-defining game for the RPG space. Blockchain is really going to amplify that experience. What we need is technology that enhances the experience, not making games, so we're just religiously focused on gameplay.\"\n\n \n\nIn fact, the hardest thing is to build a fun game, but once you do, it will retain users, and they will want to keep playing the game. Therefore, the assets within the game itself have immediate utility. And so really, utility of the asset is really the function of the quality and fun of the game. \n\n \n\nWe are amazed at Otero's deep knowledge of various game industries, and also believe that under Otero's leadership, the different trade-offs between blockchain or partner type evaluation and available technologies will be carefully weighed. Concept Art House looks forward to Azra Games in the region. The blockchain industry will develop better and better!", "timestamp": 1653272499, "digest": "GpMBzwIza860jQW-NqlyvnHRgfzUIuclxLjM-P-fQqM", "contributor": "0xDa1d7A58c7927830c5252d7B6DCe344c3666DAfD"}

We Concept Art House couldn't help being proud of SkateX after we heard the news. Let’s chat with Curtis Chiu, Executive Producer about SkateX's growth, the process of making the game and where SkateX is headed.\n\nFor the majority of us, our first video game memories are centered around a specific console or PC title. For Chiu, however, his video game journey began at a pool hall. Chiu racked up an impressive resume full of video game bona fides at companies like Konami, Sega and Kabam before joining Block Tackle. \n\nChiu called the shots while working On SkateX, so he was very busy putting the game together, but he was able to take a few minutes to answer a few questions for On Deck. About his pool hall days, his passion for Sega, and why SkateX wasn't a simulator.\n\nRead Curtis Chiu's detailed interview with SkateX below.\n\n**Q:** What specific aspect of SkateX are you working on right now? \n\n**A:** Right now I’m reviewing art styles to see what kind of look and feel we want. Some options are more heavy lined and noir-ish to give a more dramatic effect. Other options are lighter art styles. Whichever way we choose, we want it to enhance the story and help people feel like they can express themselves. \n\nI’m also looking at potential storylines for the game. It’s crucial for people to feel super immersed in the game and get more enjoyment out of it. The story line will also keep people excited for future content, feature and game mode drops. \n\n**Q:** From the early NFT drops of things like skateboards with rockets, it’s obvious that SkateX will have an exaggerated feel to it. How “realistic” do you want SkateX to be?\n\n**A:** There are plenty of other skateboard games out there that provide simulation or a totally realistic feel. We want to bring something different to the audience. Something that has more entertainment value than just skating. Creating more of an exaggerated environment also allows us to scale in different ways than just adding new parks and cities. We can do more content, different modes and create a more open ended experience for the players. \n\n**Q:** Part of the fun of skateboarding in real life is the freedom that comes with it and hanging out with your friends. How will players connect and hang out in the world of SkateX?\n\n**A:** SkateX will have a central hub where everybody can congregate and interact in lots of ways with their friends. We’ll also be adding stuff like emojis and mini games where people can cooperate with others. We really want to make sure there are a lot of ways people can positively interact with one another. \n\n**Q:** What other activities will SkateX do next?\n\n**A:** A lot of people in the community have been asking about this and yes – Staking is coming. That’s all I can say right now.\n\nThis is the latest information about SkateX and if you want to learn more,please check out SkateX's official website and Twitter for more highlights. Concept Art House is also looking forward to more surprises SkateX will bring us in the future!", "timestamp": 1653272564, "digest": "TYqgWQAk1ub87fANlXHj8ZDp6tGkSN_5J3RZQRN6Mek", "contributor": "0xDa1d7A58c7927830c5252d7B6DCe344c3666DAfD"}

Concept Art House is also delighted with the breakthrough achievements of its partners. Let's learn more about the event below!\n\n \n\n[Petaverse Network](http://petaverse.network/), a non-fungible token (NFT) game company started by the founders of [Tiny Rebel Games](https://venturebeat.com/2022/03/03/tiny-rebel-games-raises-7m-to-build-the-petaverse-network/), will use the Polygon blockchain to mint its cute digital cats. It’s taking the gameplay of virtual pets — like the old Nintendogs game — and modernizing them based on blockchain and metaverse ideas. Susan Cummings and Lee Cummings, who have two decades of experience making games, started the Petaverse Network, which aims to combine games, XR, and web 3 to define an open standard for digital pets in the [metaverse](https://venturebeat.com/2020/05/05/just-how-close-are-we-to-achieving-the-metaverse/).\n\n \n\nThis is the first blockchain partnership for Petaverse Network, but it may not be the only one. Petaverse said the deal marks the first of many platforms Petaverse Network will partner with, powering its mission to become the first cross-chain platform for digital pets — beginning with the first drop of Petaverse Network cats this summer.\n\n \n\nWhile NFTs have run into lots of resistance among hardcore gamers, Susan Cummings believes that NFT titles with more gameplay and emotional connections will fare better, especially with broader mainstream audiences that include women players as well as men. \n\n \n\nPetaverse Network will also be supported by Polygon Studios, an organization for onboarding developers, brands, artists, and content creators to web 3 through investment, marketing, developer, and community support.\n\n \n\n“Polygon and Polygon Studios are committed to building a decentralized future so that everyone can have access to Web3 applications,” Brian Trunzo, metaverse lead at Polygon Studios, in a statement. “Through this partnership with Petaverse Network, we look forward to fostering growth amongst the Web3 community who are entering the metaverse through decentralized apps and taking their digital companions along too.”\n\n \n\n“We are incredibly excited to see this partnership come to fruition as we begin the Petaverse Network journey,” said Susan Cummings, CEO of Petaverse Network, in a statement. “As we continue to expand cross-chain support for multiple blockchains, it’s important that we focus on creating meaningful partnerships that support utility. Launching first on Polygon is a significant milestone as we deploy multi-chain support and we can’t wait to see what the future holds.”\n\n \n\n“We see this as a fundamental shift in how we think about pets, both physical and virtual. A pet that you can take with you in all variety of experiences and on all variety of devices and platforms, wherever you are in your lives,” she said. “A pet unconstrained by the laws of the physical world – one day a child allergic to dogs will put on AR glasses and have a pet ownership experience close to, but in some ways so much better, than owning a real pet.”\n\nCummings added, “Some day an older person will leave their home and pets to go into long-term care, and while their favorite cat has to be left behind, a digital twin can be at their side until the end. The idea of a persistent, resilient, re-interpretable pet, running behind you in a 3rd person shooter, sitting on your desk in AR, running around the bottom of your browser like a feline Clippy, just hanging out wherever you are, facilitated by a web 3 tech stack network, is the promise and the value to the user. How much a user cares about this will vary massively; but we’re betting those millions of Nintendogs owners, Tamagotchi owners, and Petz franchise owners will be excited by the idea of a persistent, breedable, provably ”theirs”, digital pet, with an ecosystem of games and experiences to take that pet into.”\n\n \n\nFor pet lovers, the company of pets must be hoped for a lifetime, and now thanks to blockchain, pets can really exist forever, no matter what form is chosen. After listening to Petaverse Network founder's description of digital pets, Concept Art House is also proud of what our partners have done, and looks forward to bringing you more surprises in future cooperation!\n\n ", "timestamp": 1653272626, "digest": "fxi2we4I7X15_7umxi4mOzQsUerUkZLNTb5YJIhqSME", "contributor": "0xDa1d7A58c7927830c5252d7B6DCe344c3666DAfD"}

共识外，以此为机制，将其链改机制立改为POS）、Binance（POA）、Sana（POS+POH）、FTX（POS+POH），FTX公链一般会项目。其代币（代币）来帮助参与者通过等账簿，来确保其安全性。除链公外，还有需要验证进入的私链，其中还包括存在多个等权力中心的联盟链。\n\n公链的能力能够为应用提供平台，降低应用开发的窗帘。不是所有应用都或者有去自己构建一个区块链（能够有多个节点保证性），而公链则类似由于平台性的产品，任何人在不同平台中允许使用和支持通过区块链运行的去中心化应用程序，用户按照自己的日常创建场景的化操作应用程序，为中心提供畜力开发的去中心化应用程序。公链协议在设计、选择共识机制、营销策略等方面存在差异，不同应用在链脚性能等方面考虑费率、效率（如TPS）、交易链协议等主要交易生态度（如跨链交易生态）、成熟度等情况。\n\n图表：公链各项情况对比\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MWrb6Wxi9whf1ey4_pdQs.png?height=259&width=1080)\n\n资料来源：Messari，Blockchair，公司官网，CSDN，中金公司研究部；注：TPS为2022年4月29日数据\n\n**以太坊：去中心化应用时代带来者“去中心化应用”**\n\n以太坊（Ethereum）是一个开源的有智能合约功能的公共区块链平台，通过专用\\[加密货币\\](javascript:void(0);)以太币（Ether，简称“ETH”）提供去中心化的以太虚拟机（Ethereum Virtual Machine）来处理点对点合约。以太币(ETH)是目前市值第二高的\\[加密货币\\](javascript:void(0);)，仅次于比特币。\n\n以太坊是各类应用孵化的摇篮。以太坊源起于比特币主链上无法构建高级应用这一缺点，因此其诞生之日从设计上就是为了解决去中心化应用开发难的情况。目前，以太坊的生态是各大公链生态中发展最迅速的之一。\n\n图表：以太坊应用生态图谱\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cmGUI4LyeB3Vmf6T5CVj_.png?height=516&width=1080)\n\n资料来源：Ethereum，中金公司研究部\n\n以太坊2.0或将带来重大变化。目前以太坊与比特币采用同样的POW共识机制，虽然POW在去中心化和安全性上比较可靠，但是在效率（涉及高额的交易费）、节能性（能耗过大，不环保）以及扩展性上有较大的问题。因此以太坊2.0有几点变化：1.将从POW转向POS共识机制（允许验证者通过质押治理Token来验证）；2.分片将数据库横向分割；3.引入eWASM以取代EVM（允许开发者使用C++、Rust等简单语言编程），以实现降低Gas费、提高网络吞吐量（可增加至2000+）、降低硬件要求、扩展以太坊生态系统、减少碳足迹等目的。\n\n**长安链：来自我国的联盟链**\n\n长安链·ChainMaker是新一代区块链开源底层软件平台，本质是联盟链（无代币，在公开透明性上逊于公链），包含区块链核心框架、组件库和工具集，由北京微芯研究院、清华大学、北京航空航天大学、[腾讯](https://www.jinglingshuju.com/data/item/c974c28926e900690a564f1c9c7bcd0b)、[百度](https://www.jinglingshuju.com/data/item/fd05aabe8ff009ce2452f115ef89b2ca)和[京东](https://www.jinglingshuju.com/data/item/1df61b33e63e8b5ee56a719adb6e724a)等知名高校、企业共同研发。与其他公链相比，联盟链因节点数量有限而实现高速的交易，但一定程度上也抛弃了完全去中心化的特性（非完全公开）。另外，长安链与公链一样有共识投票机制，但并非采用传统公链的POW或POS机制，也没有自己的Token，而是采用了Solo、Raft、TBFT、HotStuff四种共识类型（根据不同场景和参与的节点数量规模，运用不同的共识）。\n\n图表：长安链生态体系\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rSGt8HOXr0eugkiMcIABZ.png?height=587&width=1080)\n\n资料来源：CCTV13（https://chainmaker.org.cn/），中金公司研究部\n\n**智能合约（Smart Contract）：基于代码的执行环节**\n\n当一帮互相不认识的人在一起时候，如何达成一致？传统模式通过中介平台撮合和担保达成一致。而Web3.0时代则可以通过基于算法的智能合约，即Smart Contract。\n\nSmart Contract是满足特定条件下在区块链上执行代码的程序。其本质是一系列代码的合集（具有自动化、不逆转性、代码公开透明性等特点），各方以数字签署合同的方式准许并维护其运行，用于自动完成某些特定的功能（如汇款、买卖虚拟NFT商品等）。智能合约潜在形象比喻可以是一台自动售货机，它更像一个执行某种功能的“程序黑盒”，用户扫码付钱，选择商品，然后拿走商品，完成购买。\n\n►优点：相比传统中介平台，Smart Contract可显著降低达成一致意见和操作的成本，允许区块链在没有中介的情况下进行可信交易，某种程度上具备替代律师、Broker中介等职业的可能性。\n\n►缺点：安全性仍要持续加强，其功能局限于代码（代码本身有可能存在错误，导致被黑客攻击），也就是写代码的人，典型例子为The DAO被攻击事件——黑客发现了以太坊智能合约中代码的漏洞，盗取大量ETH，最终以太坊只能采用硬分叉来尽力保护用户资产。\n\n图表：智能合约可比喻为一台自动售货机\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TEVqrnX5623A-wnHJX7Qg.png?height=331&width=1020)\n\n资料来源：Shermin Voshmgir《Token Economy: How the Web3 reinvents the Internet》(2020)，中金公司研究部\n\nOracle：链上和链下数据的“桥梁”。Oracle是一个为区块链项目提供真实世界数据服务的中间件。由于智能合约很多时候面临线下和线上数据相结合的问题，Oracle就是“桥梁”，其中的“游客”包括软件、硬件、输入、输出等设备和代码。典型案例有Chainlink项目，其为DeFi在去中心化的模式下创造了丰富的数据环境，通过聚合多个链下市场数据源，核心解决Oracle本身的信任机制问题。\n\n**DAO（Decentralized Autonomous Organizations）：去中心化组织形式**\n\nDAO是去中心化组织的一种组织形式，其对应Web2.0时代的公司，本质是对公司、政府这种组织形式的革新。相比于传统公司，DAO首先解决传统的“代理人困境”难点，DAO不存在代理人，它将执行交给Smart Contract，将治理权给予股东的直接投票机制（比如决定其公司决策机制的Protocol）。同时，DAO也是对传统公司管理形式的革新——其基于专业分工、代码、共识机制等方式将生态各参与方整合起来成为一个新的组织，承担原有公司化的职能，典型案例如CultDAO。最后，疫情趋势下，“远程办公”正在成为某种不可逆的趋势，而DAO则有希望和“远程办公”趋势协同发展。\n\n图表：DAO是对传统“自上而下”组织结构的颠覆\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MAF8yOj50iZL1rCJZTXO1.png?height=403&width=1080)\n\n资料来源：Shermin Voshmgir《Token Economy: How the Web3 reinvents the Internet》(2020)，中金公司研究部\n\n在DAO社区中决策机制通常分为链上和链下。Smart Contract只能执行现有代码，而DAO需要持续更新，这背后就需要一套决策机制，持续更新DAO的运行规则。链上决策就是指由成员提出议案，社区进行投票表决。按照区块链的性质，理论上链上决策才是唯一的路径，然而弱点是效率太低（需要经过区块链大部分节点同意），同时因为投票权掌握在Token更多的成员手中，容易引发中心化问题（事情本身是去中心化的，但是Token持有的份额导致了中心化）。针对链上效率低的问题，有时成员会进行链下决策——在其他社交平台充分讨论议案后进行决策，但缺点是讨论本身也可以被利益左右的人引导。作为一种完整的组织形式，DAO内部存在相对应的财政和货币政策。财政政策通常与代币的总供给相关，而货币政策通常与交易成本挂钩，而交易成本通常由主链TPS决定。\n\nDAO目前仍处于探索阶段，存在诸多问题。首先是安全性问题，案例为The DAO，2016年其基于Ethereum建立去中心化的量化基金，最初发行了1.5亿美元募资。然而由于代码漏洞，The DAO的社区成员被偷走了5000万美元价值的ETH，最后以Ethereum强行硬分叉告终，以尽量减少用户损失。这也说明了DAO这种理想型治理结构的初级发展阶段（稚嫩期）。其次是相应人才的缺失问题，DAO背后的机制设计需要经济学、社会学、政治学等相关专业知识，目前主要参与者仍然以技术背景为主，导致机制设计仍存在诸多不完善之处。\n\n图表：链上或链下决策机制\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oEPYReenYkAgLvgtH9nch.png?height=364&width=806)\n\n资料来源：Shermin

Internet》(2020)，中金公司研究部\n\n**代币（Token）：Web3.0的“原子”基础单位**\n\nToken是区块链权益载体的基础单位。区块链的机制是把人与人的互动记录在一个不可篡改的公开账本中，但记账是要花成本的，为了激励，记账的人可以获得Token作为奖励，Token是区块链的基本组成单位。以Bitcoin为例，Token代表在Blockchain的一个入口，只有持有Wallet私钥才能够进入。而Bitcoin的挖矿就指代矿工通过矿机运算，消耗的算力被给予一定的报酬（即Token，比特币），这就是POW的共识机制。从技术角度来看，Token属性可以分类为原生Token（比如ETH）和衍生Token（比如ERC-20）。从可分性角度，Token可以分成可分型（例如比特币）和不可分型（Non Fungible Token，也即NFT）。\n\nToken是一种所有权的象征，而这种象征可以代表资产、权力等。其中资产型Token可分为证券型Token、集体所有权Token和代表艺术收藏品的Token（如NFT）。\n\n可以说，好的制度绝不是建立在对人性的考验上，而是找到制度与利益的统一之处。Token和公链是不可分割的存在，没有链就不会衍生出Token，没有Token就没有人记账，那这个链也无法建立信任。\n\n图表：资产型Token概述\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wTl9e_8tzaUMkGuyiOMFn.png?height=530&width=1080)\n\n资料来源：Shermin Voshmgir《Token Economy: How the Web3 reinvents the Internet》(2020)，中金公司研究部\n\n除代表资产外，Token体系本身可以用来实现某些目的（Purpose-Driven），例如激励用户。Purpose-Driven Token背后对应的是一整套激励体制的设计和建设，是经济学、数学、社会学等多学科的综合问题，与社会治理体系设计相类似。类似DAO的决策机制，激励Token的机制设计目前仍然处于初级阶段，存在诸多不完善之处。\n\nToken激励的潜在风险。Token激励机制是Web3.0应用中的重要一环，然而，其匿名属性以及类似众筹的属性也带来潜在的过度投机、洗钱等风险。由此，如何对Token发行机制进行有效监管成为全球各国监管机构面对的首要问题。目前来看，Know Your Customer (KYC)，即对交易账户进行实名，以及反洗钱等条例已经基本成为监管正规化的底线。而相对来说，中国监管机构则选择禁止Token代币机制设计，其出发点则是防范过度投机炒作，对普通投资者和用户进行保护。\n\n## Web3.0应用展望：无边光景一时新\n\nWeb3.0的破圈须仰仗丰富的应用。正如前文所言，Web3.0基础设施目前已经相对完善，但其更大规模的破圈还需要应用生态的发展。基于“跨越鸿沟”理论来看，我们认为Web3.0整体生态目前正处于从“创新者”迈入“早期采用者”的跨越时期，创新者基于区块链、Token经济等先进技术青睐进入这个行业，而早期采用者则基于对产品本身能够带来巨变而进入行业，而这背后就需要“划时代”级别单个重量级应用出现。而再往下一层，行业将“跨越鸿沟”，其决定标准则是能否提供针对某些特定问题完善整体产品解决方案（完整生态）。\n\n总结来看，我们认为应用生态是Web3.0是否能够进军大众市场的关键要素。当下来看，在现有应用中，DeFi、NFT是相对成熟的，主要原因是其衍生自Web3.0应用自带的经济体系，由此DeFi某种程度是Web3.0生态的基础应用（比如\\[交易所\\](javascript:void(0);)是当下行业最重要“流量入口”）。其次，NFT则凭借数字资产浪潮吸引大量关注度，但仍处于早期。仍然存在大量投机风险。GameFi则凭借\\[游戏\\](javascript:void(0);)受众广，盈利能力强等属性有望成为下一个应用增长点，Axie Infinity和StepN等应用展现一定潜力。最后SocialFi等其他方向还在探索期。如何平衡经济体系和行业娱乐属性，是GameFi和SocialFi等社交娱乐应用设计者需要重点突破问题之一。\n\n图表：Web3.0目前正在从创新者往早期采用者跨越的区间\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lsaLL1Kum6rDcfhsbPscT.png?height=722&width=1012)\n\n资料来源：Geoffrey A. Moore 《Crossing the Chasm》(2009)，中金公司研究部\n\n**DeFi：重要基础应用，发展相对成熟**\n\nDeFi（去中心化金融）是Web 3.0重要的基础应用。DeFi，崛起于2017年（以Ethereum应用生态的出现为起点），是以区块链技术为核心的去中心化金融体系，一切过程都由智能合约自动完成，而不需要像传统金融市场那样依赖金融中介进行交易。由于Web3.0应用生态自带经济体系，所以其需要对应金融系统支持运转，由此，DeFi是Web3.0重要基础型应用。此外，因为DeFi的所有信息是储存在区块链上的，所以DeFi也具有公开透明性和可追溯性等特点。基于POS的机制，DeFi的整体锁仓量（押金）从2017年起逐渐抬升，至2021年11月达到最高峰（约1090亿美元），显示出行业在迅速发展。\n\n图表：DeFi整体锁仓量（十亿美元）\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0xJNF0lB37ET6bS6tgl1r.png?height=415&width=765)\n\n资料来源：DeFi

NFT游戏角色简介\n\n### 2.1 雪人Yeti\n\nYeti是游戏最主要的角色，它们可用于开采特定资源，具体取决于Yeti的种族类型和稀有度。\n\n一共有9种不同的雪人，根据产出的不同可以分为三组类型：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vAsGagFc0aXYodf-AgWKq.png?height=263&width=554)\n\n拿着普通斧头、高级斧头，手拿普通锯子的雪人开采木头资源，每次开采需消耗能量和工具耐久度，耐久度可通过矿石代币修复。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5YSw19O1fsamU1y-TtNol.png?height=271&width=554)\n\n带电锯、普通镐和电钻的雪人开采矿石资源(millirium)，每次开采需消耗能量和工具耐久度，耐久度通过木头代币修复。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3MYMR2ANfzZv_wLaqA5v2.png?height=265&width=554)\n\n初学、中级和高级的雪人工程师是可再生能源生产的先驱，它们产出能量，每次开采仅消耗耐久，耐久需要通过矿石和木头来修复。\n\n### 2.2 护身符Amulet\n\n游戏中目前有6种不同的护身符，可以用于增加每次开采的资源数量，或减少每次开采所需要消耗的数量，同时将护身符放置到祭坛还可以产出一些spirit代币。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9nw67oE3IxfpdMcVCDmQ-.png?height=282&width=312)\n\n护身符除了可从atomichub交易市场购买，还可以使用木头、矿石和精神三种代币来制作。\n\n### 2.3 魔法砖magicbrick\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-epA4k2iHzHWgbxPy2aR1.png?height=346&width=430)\n\n小屋(cabin)是雪人们居住的建筑物，游戏初始为每个玩家提供了两间小屋，初始每间小屋仅可容纳一个同一类型的雪人，也就是如果你有两个工程师雪人NFT用于挖能量代币，可将它们分别放置到两个小屋中，但如果有第三个同样用于挖掘能量的雪人，就需要使用魔法砖来升级你的小屋。\n\n蓝色和绿色魔法砖可用于增加小屋容量，普通cabin升级到大型cabin需要3块蓝色魔法砖或1块绿色魔法砖，大型升级到别墅需要6块蓝色魔法砖或2块绿砖，一个玩家最多可在游戏内放置18只不同类型的雪人。\n\n粉色和紫色魔法砖则可用于增加使用护身符的插槽。\n\n### 2.4 土地land\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/B9wzz_HQZRDqr-7hphMyv.png?height=320&width=554)\n\n玩家除了挖掘资源，也可以选择持有一块或多块土地，每块土地有不同的开采类型和稀有度，土地所有者可从其他玩家在该土地上开采的资源中获得 2% 到 8% 的分润收益。\n\n注意目前土地还未开始销售，另外如上图所示，在页面中心的阿曼达岛屿附近有六块大型岛屿(megaland)，官方后期将会举行拍卖会，它们每一块是普通土地面积的7倍，且该土地的所有者将和传奇土地所有者平分系统总佣金池的40%。\n\n## 3. 玩法流程\n\n在对经济模型和游戏角色有个基础了解后，让我们来看看雪人家族的具体玩法：\n\n**进入游戏网站自动连接钱包：**\n\n[https://saar.game/](https://saar.game/)\n\n**第一次登录首先会看到资源选择页面：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vdC2xqfZ1zS57DBucooNs.png?height=329&width=554)\n\n根据你持有的雪人类型选择其中一种资源类型来采挖，玩家在同一时间段只能开采木头、矿石、能源这三种中的其中一种，如果你选择开采能源，而账号中还有挖掘木头的雪人，那它将只能产出spirit代币(无需消耗能量)。\n\n玩家可自由切换采挖资源类型，但需要支付相应的代币，比如从挖能源切换到挖木头，需支付500个srw币。\n\n**选择土地：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yIYHEJHdvNmdviTTCuKUe.png?height=287&width=554)\n\n土地可以选megaland或是周围的普通土地都可以，只要点击每块土地看到左侧详细信息里显示有choose for mining即可选择，土地选择需注意，如果是普通地，land type要选择和你主挖的资源一致的地，另外天气尽量选当前是sunny的，如果是其他天气类型会影响产出。\n\n**选好后在页面右下角点击Village进入游戏页面如下图所示：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4cCnUWahZUSIGs44sUNhq.png?height=308&width=554)\n\n**点击小屋，进入采挖页面：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6K5wHYo_jd99wwTM7YL82.png?height=316&width=554)\n\n根据你的雪人类型在右侧分栏选择合适的插槽放置NFT，放置好后如无显示刷新页面即可。\n\n**雪人放置好后即可开始采挖：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fFmRVQoPILIRN_7MqqIqN.png?height=320&width=554)\n\n上图是普通能量开采工程师的采挖页面，每1小时claim一次，一次大约可获得45.45个能量代币，消耗60个耐久度，需要12个矿石和18个木头代币来修复，这里玩家可选择每次去repair，也可以积累到耐久度用完。\n\n另如果是挖木头或矿石，采挖时需要消耗能量，因此要事先充入一些能量代币到游戏中。\n\n以上就是雪人家族大致的流程，目前claim间隔默认是1小时，每支付5个spirit币可将claim间隔时间延长1小时。\n\n**收益方面团队暂时没有给官方的ROI表，这里附上一份社区玩家做的表格：**\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iOYDIqOca5KLEZB3QS6Eqs5TblaK0oE9dB2VnXgCGzs/edit#gid=2079524431](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iOYDIqOca5KLEZB3QS6Eqs5TblaK0oE9dB2VnXgCGzs/edit#gid=2079524431)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XuB9ij_hikVtKoIYzx9pR.png?height=251&width=554)\n\n可以填入你想配置的NFT，参考下大致的ROI，但需要注意，游戏内数据是动态变化的，它这里记录的消耗产出和实际存在出入，同时没有考虑手续费和精神代币的产出，所以它只是暂时的参考，从目前观察来看，产出矿石和能量的ROI比木头要好，同时等级越高的收益越高，不考虑价格波动，史诗传奇的ROI平均在10天上下，相对普通的在30天以上。\n\n## 4. 项目测评及潜力分析\n\nSAAR雪人家族是比较典型的多币制挖矿游戏，这也是目前市场主流的一种经济模型，玩家可选择不同的玩法策略，token之间互为供需，可使游戏维持更长期的经济平衡。\n\n相对于市场同类项目，SAAR的主要亮点一是通过第四种代币sws的消耗，来延长claim时间间隔，达到一定程度的自动化采挖，从同类项目来看，这种设计是有一定玩家需求的。\n\n另一个是天气状况的设计，每块土地每24小时都可能会有不同的天气变化，Sunny太阳天不会对玩家有任何影响，Windy阴天，有30%概率产生，它会减少Yeti15%的产出量，有10%的几率遇到Snowstorm暴风雪天，在这种天气条件下，开采量减少50%，同时消耗量翻倍，对于普通NFT，这时玩家可能需要选择停工。\n\n天气的变量增加了游戏的随机性，同时也有助于对游戏内各种资源供需进行动态调整，通过对近年来链游市场的观察，我们也发现，经济模式不只是写在白皮书和表格里的单一数据，随着游戏的发展，能进行有效的动态调节对项目的长期很重要。\n\n问题方面目前来说可能最主要的还是市场偏小众，据Dappradar数据，日活用户数在500左右，这里主要原因可能在于随着加密市场进入熊市，链游市场一直萎靡不振，特别是近期wax价格大幅下跌，也导致很多玩家离场，另外该项目从销售到上线的时间间隔稍长，现在也会存在一点热度缺失，包括NFT市场交易量暂时不高，还需要看团队在未来是否能够通过一些营销或市场活动激发更多玩家的兴趣。\n\n不过市场趋冷对玩家来说不一定是坏事，像现在市场上的入门包也就在10-30刀不等，风险可控，所以它还是比较适合一些喜欢玩这种采挖游戏的玩家去体验。\n\n对于未来的关注点一是制作合成，从NFT市场来看，他家各类型的雪人体量并不是特别大，早期包八九成也都被打开，随着用户增长，有望刺激合成需求，合成消耗更多的代币，代币价值增长再推动更多的用户增长，这也是这种挖矿合成类主要的增长模式。\n\n另一个就是土地，目前官方还未公布销售规则，对玩家来说，它可能也是该游戏接下来的一个机会点。\n\n## 相关链接\n\n`官推：`\n\n[https://twitter.com/SaaR_nft](https://twitter.com/SaaR_nft)\n\n`白皮书：`\n\n[https://whitepaper.saar.network/](https://whitepaper.saar.network/)\n\n## TSA 欢迎你的加入：\n\n[https://twitter.com/tsa_guild](https://twitter.com/tsa_guild)\n\n[https://discord.com/invite/TSACLUB](https://discord.com/invite/TSACLUB)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653272868, "digest": "MIbMrEPFslnl04gAUayyZ2CpW313s_6GVvk6md56GEI", "contributor": "0xeF96650E66688D5Fedb995432E28cdadDCcCBF71"}

1. 项目概况\n\n**1.1 游戏背景：**\n\n你有想过在区块链上开一家虚拟餐厅吗，并且通过经营它来获取收益？\n\nMediumrarepotato是一款基于wax的以餐厅经营为故事背景的小型P2E游戏，团队希望玩家能通过努力和合适的策略来“click to earn”和“manage/hire to earn”，并从中找寻到乐趣。那么它究竟是怎么样的一个项目呢，这种餐厅背景的链游好像并不多见，那下面就让我带大家一起来探索一下。\n\n**1.2 土豆餐厅游戏角色**\n\n该游戏的NFT主要有三个大类：餐厅(restaurant)，厨师(cook\\\\chef\\\\helper)和菜品(dish)。\n\n**1.3 餐厅(restaurant)**\n\n餐厅类似于很多链游中的“土地”，拥有一家餐厅就像是“地主”，你既可以安排自家的厨子做菜赚钱，也可以招收外面的厨师赚取佣金。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-N2U5NE9sW-gL-ksGATX0.png?height=464&width=557)\n\n在游戏中internal team内部团队为餐厅老板自己拥有的厨师，external team外部团队是公共的，任何厨师都可以来占用它，开始时公共插槽数量=N(目前设置为2)，公共插槽即最多可容纳外部厨师的数量，该插槽可使用游戏内MRP代币扩充，没有限制。\n\n如需要提高餐厅的稀有度，还需开放一定数量的插槽，同时稀有度更高，也意味着对内部团队有更多的插槽位置可以使用。\n\n每完成一个菜品，内部厨师会得到MRP奖励，餐厅的收益一是来自内部厨师的全部做菜收益，另一个是外部厨师的佣金，这块可以由老板自行设定，佣金范围0%-25%。\n\n**\\*另外关于餐厅还需特别说明两点：**\n\n`营业时间`\n\n餐厅有五个等级：普通，不常见，稀有，史诗，传奇。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/32LaN_BVX78DronxUusPL.png?height=306&width=551)\n\n根据等级每天有不同的工作时长，一家普通餐厅每天只能工作12小时，休息12小时之后，由老板重新开放餐厅，最高的传奇餐厅可以连续工作21小时。餐厅关门后，厨师们完成手头菜单，可根据厨师的等级，选择离开休息或等待餐厅下一次开业。\n\n这里也就是说，**他家的产币不是连续的，需要考虑餐厅的作息时间。**\n\n`修正值`\n\n每完成一道菜品所获得的MRP，还要乘以一个修正值，才是最后厨师们拿到的收入。\n\n根据餐厅等级不同，该修正值为：普通-0.5，不常见-0.6，稀有-0.8，史诗-1.1，传奇1.6.\n\n即假如一个厨师的菜单收益为20个MRP(暂不考虑佣金)，因为他是在一家普通餐厅服务，所以实际获得的收益为20\\*0.5=10个MRP。\n\n从上述两点来看，**餐厅的稀有度，对产出效益的影响是比较大的**。\n\n**1.4 厨师**\n\n中文翻译好像有点难区分，但游戏里对厨师这个角色是有三种类型划分：chef, cook和helper.\n\n**1.5 Chef**\n\n主厨，更高级的厨师，他主要的优势一是可以和餐厅签订3、7、30天的合同，在合同期内，在餐厅休息后可不必离开餐厅，但注意合同期结束后，chef需要休息12小时，才能继续到其他餐厅工作，如合同期未满离开餐厅，有可能会扣除权重分(目前暂不清楚其影响)。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eNDefz9GeDsRsns6AdnIk.png?height=310&width=557)\n\n另一个比较大的优势是Chef可以选择任意稀有度的菜肴来完成，而普通厨师只能根据自身的稀有度来选择任务，因此Chef的收益是相对更高的。\n\n另外Chef有相对更多的助手插槽，目前普通等级的主厨可以配置3个助手帮助他在同一时间段完成更多的菜肴。\n\n**1.6 Cook**\n\n普通厨师相对更灵活，他们可以选择任何有空位的餐厅开始工作，餐厅关门后，将自动离开，休息12个小时后，玩家可再选择其他工作地点。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aAjL6rkKbhadsMbzbROfy.png?height=288&width=557)\n\nCook可以选择做自己的或是餐厅提供的菜单上的菜肴，但注意他只能选择与自己稀有度相当或以下的菜品，比如稀有cook只能选择烹饪稀有或常见的菜品。另外cook也可以配置帮手来完成菜单，但相对chef，帮手插槽数量要少。\n\n不过cook也可以选择通过提升稀有度以及参与PVP获胜来升级成chef(PVP功能暂未上线)：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y001eahZ4HQ3qQEGxQcTw.png?height=205&width=557)\n\n**1.7 Helper帮手**\n\n帮手不能自己接任务做菜，但可以放置在chef或cook的插槽里协助完成任务，帮手的主要作用是加快烹饪速度，使厨师们可在同一时间段接更多的任务。\n\n帮手有五个等级，按等级可加快烹饪过程：\n\n*普通- 5%*\n\n*罕见- 10%*\n\n*稀有- 15%*\n\n*史诗- 20%*\n\n*传奇- 25%*\n\n**1.8 菜品(dish)及烹饪**\n\n游戏中设计了各种不同稀有度的菜品NFT，它们分别代表不同的烹饪时间和产币能力，换句话说，MRP的产出就建立在这些菜品以及对菜品烹饪的时间管理之上。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/R4hSy2tqWoIGHvTJsQp50.png?height=164&width=557)\n\n厨师们可以只用餐厅提供的菜肴，但如果想要获得更多的收益，还是需要自己持有一些菜品来供搭配选择。\n\n在游戏过程中，**每个厨师角色每3小时可选择烹饪N道菜**，也就是你的厨师能完成的菜品相对越多，菜品稀有度产币能力相对越高，你单位时间所能获得的收入也越多，当然这里怎么来安排，就看个人策略了，并没有统一的答案。\n\n**\\*需要注意的规则是：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/20PnsSDTdr_pgEi4YbeX3.png?height=484&width=557)\n\n**\\*系统将菜肴分为三个类别：**\n\n餐厅菜肴\n\n主厨菜肴(如果该餐厅提供，且为主厨)\n\n角色自定义菜肴\n\n你需要从餐厅菜肴中选择一种，主厨菜肴选择一种(如果有的话)，以及角色菜肴即自己持有的菜肴中选择任意N种，只要满足时间条件即可。\n\n**\\*官方有给一个各类型菜品的产币表：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xyCujjPLmu6YGQsFFolbd.png?height=88&width=557)\n\n注意最后的实际收入还要扣除餐厅佣金(如果不是自己开店)，并乘以修正值。\n\n##

wallet可提取到链上钱包，需注意提取手续费是20%，随时间每天下降一个点。\n\n上述差不多是目前主要一个产币玩法，后续还可以升级和PVP：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/egc5H_h_HRs8Ge1qg2wRk.png?height=446&width=518)\n\n助手+MRP合成Cook，Cook不断晋级稀有度，最后参与PVP获胜者可生成Chef，其他玩家获得切片蛋糕奖励，切片蛋糕可以合成随机MRP奖励。\n\n## 3. 项目测评\n\n上述是土豆餐厅整体项目情况和玩法的一个介绍，最后我们再来整理评测一下。\n\n从玩法上来说，收益主要取决于你的策略，比如有没有餐厅，餐厅的稀有度，厨师是cook还是chef，菜品的选择，时间管理等等，目前并没有一个固定的ROI计算，可能需要玩家根据自己的配置以及上面的菜肴产币表格自行估算。\n\n这里笔者只能给大家一点测试数据以供参考，投入一个chef一个rare菜品，找的普通餐厅，一轮三小时做三个菜，产币20.5，一天大概82个币，按0.2wax价格，且不考虑手续费及后续价格波动问题，大概ROI在40-50天左右。\n\n不过这个没太多考虑餐厅和菜肴选择，还有提升空间，另有个社区玩家的配置，一个cook一个chef大概一轮能产80-90个MRP：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sVRPwhZtQu-wmODtJ07vA.png?height=431&width=557)\n\nMediumrarepotato这个项目看上去可能有一些复杂，餐厅雇佣的玩法不乏新意和趣味性，但本质上还是P2E产币+合成消耗，项目方前期发包是比较克制的，餐厅的数量和休息时间，也对MRP的通胀起到限制作用，也因此项目在正式上线的第一天就排到了AH交易市场的第二名，交易量也还不错。\n\n不过也存在一些问题，单币制波动性较大，MRP的流动性欠佳，目前更多的是产出，合成消耗还跟不上，可能短期更多还要靠团队来把控，这里还是需要多注意风险，不过目前游戏里的Chef和餐厅的稀有度都只有普通，从机制上来说，在未来是需要玩家来消耗代币升级，但怎么升级还有PVP都还未定，如有兴趣的玩家，也可继续观察看看。\n\n##

Phantom Network is referred to as PXN, which defines itself as the power of Web3, a vague, invisible and eternal shadow.\n\n \n\nAt the same time, PXN is also their vision for a web3 experience that allows users to see the world through perspective of a completely different environment. PXN builds a practical network that allows users to thrive in web3 and build a unified growth platform together with each other.\n\n \n\nLet's know more Phantom Network!\n\n \n\n**Ⅰ. Outline**\n\nThere are 100 Regiments each led by a Phantom, with each regiment comprised of 100 Ghosts under the Phantom’s charge. What is Ghost? Ghost will be your passport to PXN, and it is also the identity that you will hold in the new world, it will passively generating tokens for use within the PXN ecosystem. PXN also has a Ghost branch with a total of 10,000 Ghosts.\n\n \n\nEvery Regiment will have a stipend of $PXN tokens to be distributed by the Phantom to members of the group, for achievements, contributions or actions deemed beneficial to the success and growth of the regiment. This may be as a result of mission completion, tasks completed, or general behaviour that the Phantom feels worthy of reward.\n\n \n\nWithin each Regiment, Ghosts can move up their ranks to earn more $PXN tokens, as higher rankings generate more daily token rewards. In addition, the user's NFT will become the key and status symbol for joining the Phantom Network, selecting and presenting the user's favorite NFT in their included projects.\n\n \n\n**Ⅱ. About Token**\n\n**NFT Holders**: Specific NFTs within the Phantom Network collections will passively generate tokens on a daily basis according to the user's rank.\n\n**Community Rewards**: Engagement rewards given to people that engage and add value positively to the network as determined by upvotes, participating in community missions, etc.\n\n**Regiment Upkeep**: This allocation of tokens will be split equally across the 100 regiments.\n\nUse of this allocation is at the discretion of the regiment's Phantom (or temporary regiment leadership) for rewarding members for regiment related activities.\n\n**Incubator Program:** A portion of the tokens will be reserved to facilitate an incubator program for onboarding potential projects to our network in a more formal capacity.\n\n**Developer's Fund**: Pool of funds for the development team to utilize in the development of the project.\n\n \n\n**Ⅲ. Token Usage**\n\n**Token Value**: As the lube of the Phantom Network, $PXN will be essential in all aspects of the platform. This section serves to outline where $PXN is required.\n\n**NFT Customization:** Certain NFT collections will be customizable, such as cosmetics, where items and/or ability to do so will be purchasable with $PXN. Further information how this will be implemented will be disclosed at a later date.\n\n**Subscription fees for PxN platform tools**: Grants full unrestricted access to the standard suite of PxN's tools and features. Subscription fees may be lowered or changed as the value of $PXN increases to maintain a cheap and accessible usage fee.\n\n \n\nIn addition, the entire 400 million supply will be minted annually as a batch on the Ethereum mainnet and stored in the ProjectPXN treasury contract for further distribution as required. The treasury balance represents the total $PXN liquidity on PxN at all times. If a user wishes to withdraw $PXN from PxN, there will be an interface to call the treasury contract and transfer the designated amount of $PXN from the treasury into the user's wallet on mainnet. The process also functions in reverse where a user can elect to deposit $PXN into PxN, where the designated amount of $PXN is transferred back into the treasury and the equivalent amount is reflected in the user's account on PxN.\n\n \n\n**Ⅳ.

{"id": "VRbhxYgPJm4V93gdS4zLmYbVgsPShtTh80AULlquakk", "title": "The Gold Standard Exhibition: Giving Shine to Asian-Americans in NFTs", "body": "In previous tweets, we talked about Concept Art House is working with Drue Kataoka, whose work-“Vitruvian Woman” exhibits at #TheGoldStandard for the first- time exhibition on the major NFT platform. This exhibition, dedicated to show the works of Asian-American artists, will take place from May 1 to May 31, 2022, in celebration of Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month.\n\n \n\nToday we look at the impact of NFT on Asian-Americans through #TheGoldStandard. What does it mean to uplift and empower underrepresented artists? It entails much more than just giving them a platform. We must dig deeper, and actively spread the word about their work, pay respect to their journeys and their potential, and support their creative intelligence.\n\n \n\nIn 2021, NFT became the global search term of the year, and the art of NFT became the talk of the town. Crypto artists unheard of in traditional art circles, such as Beeple, Pak, etc., sold overnight for prices higher than Picasso. Art is perhaps one of the most mysterious intangible cultural products of the value system in the world.\n\n \n\nWith the emergence of NFT, the mysterious black box of art transaction is opened. The collection process of NFT is open, and creators, collectors, transaction records and prices are clearly and permanently recorded on the blockchain. NFT can also be structured and published using smart contracts, whose distribution mechanisms and financial flows are transparent. This approach breaks the rules of the game that art belongs only to a small elite class. Once the work has backers, the NFT works produced and sold by smart contracts are a testament to the amount of work that participants put in.\n\n \n\nRunning the entire month of May, #TheGoldStandard features 10 artists that help refract the Asian American and global pan-Asian experience through their diverse practices. With this first-of-its-kind showcase, SuperRare is communicating the importance of the diverse populations that make up the NFT ecosystem, bringing Kataoka on board to spearhead the endeavor and drive the point home.\n\n \n\nSince 2018, SuperRare has provided a stage for artists big and small. Although it may seem like a highly curatorial platform, SuperRare continues to earn accolades for its community-centric values and ventures aimed at supporting underrepresented artists.\n\n \n\nAs a prominent digital artist and CEO of Drue Kataoka Art Studios, Kataoka has continued to meet and break barriers in the traditional art world. Now, in Web3, she has emerged as a champion of diversity in the NFT space with the goal of bringing recognition, acknowledgment, and celebration to the countless AAPI artists who have paved the way for the advancement of digital art.\n\n \n\n“From pushing visual technology to its limits in Hollywood special effects, to building virtual worlds for top gaming experiences, to advancing the frontier of technology art, \\[Asian American artists\\] have been the backbone of digital creativity for decades,” Kataoka said in an interview with nft now. “Asian Americans have played a critical role in turning the best-known digital franchises into household names, but they haven’t really gotten their just due. For the most part, they’ve been really toiling away in the shadows. We even have examples of some of these artists in the show: astonishingly talented, yet not as well-known as they should be.”\n\n \n\nUnder the digital wave, the binary thinking of \"digital - entity\" has apparently unable to effectively participate in the reality. It is likely that these artists will refer institutions as the experiment platform, thus to integrate technology, social, aesthetic demand in different levels of interests, and then art have the opportunity to participate in the larger in the construction of social capital in the future.\n\n \n\nThe #TheGoldStandard exhibition includes pieces minted by digital artists as well as scientists and researchers who are pushing the frontiers of what is technically possible in crypto.  With “Vitruvian Woman” — a piece created by Drue Kataoka Studios in collaboration with Concept Art House —  Kataoka reimagines Leonardo da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man as a multi-cultural Asian American woman in a sea of gold and will a portion of the proceeds from the sale of this specific piece will benefit the non-profit Asian Health Services.", "timestamp": 1653272732, "digest": "Qf1BFwkKHXn3aH7CRVRBrf0CUv3OcSQVsYr6y6G4_d0", "contributor": "0xDa1d7A58c7927830c5252d7B6DCe344c3666DAfD"}

1. 项目概况\n\n**1.1 游戏背景：**\n\n你有想过在区块链上开一家虚拟餐厅吗，并且通过经营它来获取收益？\n\nMediumrarepotato是一款基于wax的以餐厅经营为故事背景的小型P2E游戏，团队希望玩家能通过努力和合适的策略来“click to earn”和“manage/hire to earn”，并从中找寻到乐趣。那么它究竟是怎么样的一个项目呢，这种餐厅背景的链游好像并不多见，那下面就让我带大家一起来探索一下。\n\n**1.2 土豆餐厅游戏角色**\n\n该游戏的NFT主要有三个大类：餐厅(restaurant)，厨师(cook\\\\chef\\\\helper)和菜品(dish)。\n\n**1.3 餐厅(restaurant)**\n\n餐厅类似于很多链游中的“土地”，拥有一家餐厅就像是“地主”，你既可以安排自家的厨子做菜赚钱，也可以招收外面的厨师赚取佣金。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-N2U5NE9sW-gL-ksGATX0.png?height=464&width=557)\n\n在游戏中internal team内部团队为餐厅老板自己拥有的厨师，external team外部团队是公共的，任何厨师都可以来占用它，开始时公共插槽数量=N(目前设置为2)，公共插槽即最多可容纳外部厨师的数量，该插槽可使用游戏内MRP代币扩充，没有限制。\n\n如需要提高餐厅的稀有度，还需开放一定数量的插槽，同时稀有度更高，也意味着对内部团队有更多的插槽位置可以使用。\n\n每完成一个菜品，内部厨师会得到MRP奖励，餐厅的收益一是来自内部厨师的全部做菜收益，另一个是外部厨师的佣金，这块可以由老板自行设定，佣金范围0%-25%。\n\n**\\*另外关于餐厅还需特别说明两点：**\n\n`营业时间`\n\n餐厅有五个等级：普通，不常见，稀有，史诗，传奇。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/32LaN_BVX78DronxUusPL.png?height=306&width=551)\n\n根据等级每天有不同的工作时长，一家普通餐厅每天只能工作12小时，休息12小时之后，由老板重新开放餐厅，最高的传奇餐厅可以连续工作21小时。餐厅关门后，厨师们完成手头菜单，可根据厨师的等级，选择离开休息或等待餐厅下一次开业。\n\n这里也就是说，**他家的产币不是连续的，需要考虑餐厅的作息时间。**\n\n`修正值`\n\n每完成一道菜品所获得的MRP，还要乘以一个修正值，才是最后厨师们拿到的收入。\n\n根据餐厅等级不同，该修正值为：普通-0.5，不常见-0.6，稀有-0.8，史诗-1.1，传奇1.6.\n\n即假如一个厨师的菜单收益为20个MRP(暂不考虑佣金)，因为他是在一家普通餐厅服务，所以实际获得的收益为20\\*0.5=10个MRP。\n\n从上述两点来看，**餐厅的稀有度，对产出效益的影响是比较大的**。\n\n**1.4 厨师**\n\n中文翻译好像有点难区分，但游戏里对厨师这个角色是有三种类型划分：chef, cook和helper.\n\n**1.5 Chef**\n\n主厨，更高级的厨师，他主要的优势一是可以和餐厅签订3、7、30天的合同，在合同期内，在餐厅休息后可不必离开餐厅，但注意合同期结束后，chef需要休息12小时，才能继续到其他餐厅工作，如合同期未满离开餐厅，有可能会扣除权重分(目前暂不清楚其影响)。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eNDefz9GeDsRsns6AdnIk.png?height=310&width=557)\n\n另一个比较大的优势是Chef可以选择任意稀有度的菜肴来完成，而普通厨师只能根据自身的稀有度来选择任务，因此Chef的收益是相对更高的。\n\n另外Chef有相对更多的助手插槽，目前普通等级的主厨可以配置3个助手帮助他在同一时间段完成更多的菜肴。\n\n**1.6 Cook**\n\n普通厨师相对更灵活，他们可以选择任何有空位的餐厅开始工作，餐厅关门后，将自动离开，休息12个小时后，玩家可再选择其他工作地点。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aAjL6rkKbhadsMbzbROfy.png?height=288&width=557)\n\nCook可以选择做自己的或是餐厅提供的菜单上的菜肴，但注意他只能选择与自己稀有度相当或以下的菜品，比如稀有cook只能选择烹饪稀有或常见的菜品。另外cook也可以配置帮手来完成菜单，但相对chef，帮手插槽数量要少。\n\n不过cook也可以选择通过提升稀有度以及参与PVP获胜来升级成chef(PVP功能暂未上线)：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y001eahZ4HQ3qQEGxQcTw.png?height=205&width=557)\n\n**1.7 Helper帮手**\n\n帮手不能自己接任务做菜，但可以放置在chef或cook的插槽里协助完成任务，帮手的主要作用是加快烹饪速度，使厨师们可在同一时间段接更多的任务。\n\n帮手有五个等级，按等级可加快烹饪过程：\n\n*普通- 5%*\n\n*罕见- 10%*\n\n*稀有- 15%*\n\n*史诗- 20%*\n\n*传奇- 25%*\n\n**1.8 菜品(dish)及烹饪**\n\n游戏中设计了各种不同稀有度的菜品NFT，它们分别代表不同的烹饪时间和产币能力，换句话说，MRP的产出就建立在这些菜品以及对菜品烹饪的时间管理之上。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/R4hSy2tqWoIGHvTJsQp50.png?height=164&width=557)\n\n厨师们可以只用餐厅提供的菜肴，但如果想要获得更多的收益，还是需要自己持有一些菜品来供搭配选择。\n\n在游戏过程中，**每个厨师角色每3小时可选择烹饪N道菜**，也就是你的厨师能完成的菜品相对越多，菜品稀有度产币能力相对越高，你单位时间所能获得的收入也越多，当然这里怎么来安排，就看个人策略了，并没有统一的答案。\n\n**\\*需要注意的规则是：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/20PnsSDTdr_pgEi4YbeX3.png?height=484&width=557)\n\n**\\*系统将菜肴分为三个类别：**\n\n餐厅菜肴\n\n主厨菜肴(如果该餐厅提供，且为主厨)\n\n角色自定义菜肴\n\n你需要从餐厅菜肴中选择一种，主厨菜肴选择一种(如果有的话)，以及角色菜肴即自己持有的菜肴中选择任意N种，只要满足时间条件即可。\n\n**\\*官方有给一个各类型菜品的产币表：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xyCujjPLmu6YGQsFFolbd.png?height=88&width=557)\n\n注意最后的实际收入还要扣除餐厅佣金(如果不是自己开店)，并乘以修正值。\n\n## 2. 玩法介绍\n\n`网站：`\n\n[https://game.medium-rare-potato.io/](https://game.medium-rare-potato.io/)\n\n`市场：`\n\n[https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=mrpotatogame&order=desc&sort=created&symbol=WAX](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=mrpotatogame&order=desc&sort=created&symbol=WAX)\n\n土豆餐厅是一个半中心化游戏，你需要把要使用的NFT或token导入到网站中：\n\n[https://game.medium-rare-potato.io/cards-wallet](https://game.medium-rare-potato.io/cards-wallet)\n\n在该页面可将钱包内的NFT选择导入到游戏中，游戏入门至少需要1个cook，其他NFT可根据自身需求配置。\n\n导入后，在页面上找到My characters(我的角色)，之后选择manage，可将dish菜肴和助手添加到你的厨师角色上：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l5lccmy1F17D76kDiB6ky.png?height=400&width=557)\n\n角色配置好后，下一步是餐厅，如果自己有餐厅可在My restautants配置开业。\n\n如果自己没有餐厅，点击页面第一个选项Restaurants为你的厨师选择一个合适的餐厅：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FMt9YpQxpeePrIJ_P1qnd.png?height=348&width=557)\n\n餐厅筛选上需注意其显示出来的菜单和佣金，另外特别要注意上面这个关店倒计时，**为了获得更多产币时间，尽量选择刚开业的店**，即这个倒计时比较接近12小时的店，不然的话可能挖不了两次就得跟着店一起休息，cook是在完成任务后休息12小时，chef在合同期内没有休息机制，但需要等餐厅下一次开放，如果老板一直不开店，chef是需要继续等待，当然在此期间可以解除合同，但解除合同后12小时才能找下一家餐厅。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/trrNiuhGZWZPgjctQiaQ7.png?height=353&width=557)\n\n餐厅选好后，再回到“我的角色”栏点击cook按钮，如上图所示，进去选择三小时内要做的菜点确认就好，MRP会自动到你的游戏账户：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kXdKPboniso5TOMwvdeE4.png?height=304&width=557)\n\n点击transfer to wallet可提取到链上钱包，需注意提取手续费是20%，随时间每天下降一个点。\n\n上述差不多是目前主要一个产币玩法，后续还可以升级和PVP：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/egc5H_h_HRs8Ge1qg2wRk.png?height=446&width=518)\n\n助手+MRP合成Cook，Cook不断晋级稀有度，最后参与PVP获胜者可生成Chef，其他玩家获得切片蛋糕奖励，切片蛋糕可以合成随机MRP奖励。\n\n## 3. 项目测评\n\n上述是土豆餐厅整体项目情况和玩法的一个介绍，最后我们再来整理评测一下。\n\n从玩法上来说，收益主要取决于你的策略，比如有没有餐厅，餐厅的稀有度，厨师是cook还是chef，菜品的选择，时间管理等等，目前并没有一个固定的ROI计算，可能需要玩家根据自己的配置以及上面的菜肴产币表格自行估算。\n\n这里笔者只能给大家一点测试数据以供参考，投入一个chef一个rare菜品，找的普通餐厅，一轮三小时做三个菜，产币20.5，一天大概82个币，按0.2wax价格，且不考虑手续费及后续价格波动问题，大概ROI在40-50天左右。\n\n不过这个没太多考虑餐厅和菜肴选择，还有提升空间，另有个社区玩家的配置，一个cook一个chef大概一轮能产80-90个MRP：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sVRPwhZtQu-wmODtJ07vA.png?height=431&width=557)\n\nMediumrarepotato这个项目看上去可能有一些复杂，餐厅雇佣的玩法不乏新意和趣味性，但本质上还是P2E产币+合成消耗，项目方前期发包是比较克制的，餐厅的数量和休息时间，也对MRP的通胀起到限制作用，也因此项目在正式上线的第一天就排到了AH交易市场的第二名，交易量也还不错。\n\n不过也存在一些问题，单币制波动性较大，MRP的流动性欠佳，目前更多的是产出，合成消耗还跟不上，可能短期更多还要靠团队来把控，这里还是需要多注意风险，不过目前游戏里的Chef和餐厅的稀有度都只有普通，从机制上来说，在未来是需要玩家来消耗代币升级，但怎么升级还有PVP都还未定，如有兴趣的玩家，也可继续观察看看。\n\n##

轮投资。\n\n而上一轮A轮融资Multicoin（原来的anyswap） 与 Binance Labs 也是共同领投，还有delphi等公司参与投资，总计600 万美元，这家公司是如何吸引到如此豪华的投资阵容呢？本期节目我们就来认识一下由他们开发的layerzero协议。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3JQFjYeMRZY17pRmaOvZp.png?height=756&width=1354)\n\nlayerzero是由  Pellegrino 、 Ryan Zarick 、以及著名前 Sushi 开发人员0xMaki 开发的通信协议，通过这个协议，开发者不需要依赖中间者，就可以搭建跨任何链的智能合约，使它们在多条链之间方便安全地互通信息。这里所指的信息范围很大，我们常说的跨链转移token只是跨链通信一个应用场景.\n\n目前layerzero已经上线7条链包括Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, BNB Chain, Fantom, Arbitrum 和Optimism. 未来2个月内还将陆续上线Solana, Terra, Cosmos Hub 和 Osmosis\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MMxTQvRjEjHAmRGQyeWVG.png?height=830&width=1348)\n\n[https://layerzero.network/](https://layerzero.network/)\n\n下面我们就从5部分来聊聊layerzero：1）layerzero协议要解决的问题及工作原理；2）layerzero在资产跨链上的应用；3）基于layerzero的资产跨链桥stargate ；4）layerzero在全链NFT上的应用 ；5）layerzero未来风险，一起看下去吧。\n\n2）首先，layerzero要解决什么问题以及如何解决？\n\n随着L1, L2 各层链的生态发展，相比于以前的以太坊一家独大，大众开始接受多链并存的状态；但是每条区块链，本质都是一个独立的自定义账本，不同链之间数据难以互通，成为了一个个数据孤岛。要想充分使用一个应用程序，开发者和用户必须在不同链之间分配资源和时间，相比于web2反而倒退了，因此跨链互联越来越成为web3的一个重要命题。\n\n现在市面上的跨链通信主要有2个方法：1）有一条形成共识的中间链在不同链之间验证和转发消息；2）在每条链上运行一个专门接受和验证信息的节点。\n\n换句话说，如果我们把链之间的通信类比成2个素不相识的黑社会组织做交易，要保证交易安全，要么找个值得信任的中间方；要么在对方组织里安排一个可靠线人报信。\n\n但是这两种方法都有缺点：前者的中间链掌握了所有信息，一旦它出问题，两条链上的信息都有问题；后者相对安全，但却很昂贵，比如在以太坊上运行一个专门的节点，每条对手方的链每天都要花费成千上万美元。\n\n那有什么方法可以做到既安全又便宜呢？layerzero创新之处就在于使用了超轻节点（ultra light node），节点和前面说的方法2相似，但它本身不去传送信息，只当个接头人，而验证和传递信息的工作则交给外部的预言机和中继器去完成，因此每个链上只需要部署一个包含较少信息的超轻节点，就可以和其他同样有节点的任何链互通信息，这里的链包括L1, L2,以及非EVM和EVM,  这些节点共同形成了处于链之上的layerzero网络\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qjKqliV2h_QAhxV37dt72.png?height=380&width=1346)\n\n大家又会问了，把传递信息最核心的工作交给外部，怎么能保证安全性呢？\n\nlayerzero的白皮书大致是这样说明的：假如信息m要从A链传到B链上，A链上的超轻节点收到这个任务，分别去提醒链外的预言机和中继器，这里预言机和中继器永远是互相独立的，也就是说他们两不可能串通；于是这边预言机去获得块头信息，那边中继器去获得交易证明；当B链上的超轻节点收到预言机的块头消息后，再提醒中继器发来证明，只有当块头消息和证明消息匹配上了，真正的消息内容才会发到B链上。\n\n这有点类似于古代的虎符，只有当君主和将领手中的虎符合为一体时，持有虎符的人才可以指挥军队。\n\n而且预言机和中继器都是可以自定义配置的，用户可以只使用 LayerZero 的轻节点，然后使用与 LayerZero 不同的中继器，以及与 Chainlink 不同的预言机。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vd0lphk2nQQFxi7oXZI32.png?height=548&width=1408)\n\n2）layerzero在资产跨链上的应用\n\n了解了layerzero数据传输的逻辑，我们再来看看协议在资产跨链方面的应用。\n\n目前资产的跨链要么是通过中心化的交易所要么通过去中心化的跨链桥，我们主要来讨论后者。\n\n从defiliama上可以看到市面上锁仓量排名靠前的一些跨链桥，比如Multichain（原anyswap）、Wormhole 等。\n\n不同的跨链桥原理各有不同，基本原理是替代法。假设要把A链上的资产X转移到B链上：首先要把这笔资产质押并获得证明，然后X就会在A链上被冻结起来，然后在B链上制造等价的凭证x’，整体看起来就好像资产转移过去了，但这样临时地铸造速度很慢，每次铸造也是一笔不必要开销。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7GITO3Ut3WE3SXNx8q1wz.png?height=640&width=1380)\n\n因此进阶的方法就是在A链和B链上分别建好流动的资金池，资产X进入A链的池子后，B链对应的池子可以立即流出提前铸造好的等价资产Y\n\n第二种方法相对更安全，因为方法一每次铸造都需要信任，过程中可能会被坏人利用。但方法二还是需要依赖官方桥已经发行的跨链资产，也逃不掉信任的问题。近年来，我们频频看到跨链桥遭受黑客攻击损失严重的新闻，一部分原因也是因为它们通过桥传递的不是原生资产，而是依赖信任生成的新资产。\n\n而layerzero协议则不需要信任就可以实现跨链之间的直接通信，依靠layerzero协议搭建的跨链dex可以直接1：1地传递原生资产，安全又便捷。\n\nlayerzero的CEO拿sushiswap和layerzero做了一个跨链桥的实操对比。比如你要把eth从以太坊换成BSC链上的BNB，再把BNB换成雪崩链上的avax，最后再换回到以太坊上。可以看到左边的sushi先要把eth换成usdc，再进行链之间的交换，而且响应速度非常迟缓，而右边基于layerzero协议不需要中间转换，只需要点3次就完成了全部转化，而且操作流畅快速，中间的费用也更低。\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFnF1dgbF00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFnF1dgbF00)\n\n3）基于layerzero的资产跨链桥stargate\n\nlayerzero最近也是上线了一个全链（Omnichain）原生资产跨链桥——stargate。已上线layerzero支持的7条链，目前只支持稳定币。\n\n3月中旬，stargate发行了代币STG，固定总量为10亿。其中35%属于团队和投资方，大约25%用于拍卖，30%用于未来社区激励。用户也可以将代币质押到stargate提供流动性来赚取 STG奖励，挖矿收益年化目前在7%左右。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zTHT3ksCZu2iMBMc_7Jw-.png?height=708&width=1290)\n\n截止4月4日这个项目上线3周左右，总锁仓量已经达到40亿美元，成为近期市场的明星项目。\n\n市面上这么多跨链桥，stargate凭什么引发了关注呢？因为它突破了资产跨链桥普遍面临的的不可能三角难题。\n\n资产跨链桥无法同时满足以下3个条件：「实时受保证的最终性」「资产原生性」和「统一流动性」\n\n实时受保证的最终性是指发起跨链请求后，能够保证在目标链接收到资产。关键就在于目标链上需要有足够的流动性。如果所有链上的都有同样资产池，所有链都能共享访问各自的流动性，也就是满足‘统一流动性“时，很容易出现以下情况：当A 链和 B 链的2个用户同时向 C 链转账X，但 C 链现有的X的流动性只足够一次转账；但是 A 链和 B 链彼此并不知道对方，于是双方都向C发起了跨链请求，但只有更快的一方才能完成交易，而慢的一方虽然提交了请求，但无法受到资产，也就违背了实时的最终性，交易必须回滚，使得用户体验非常糟糕\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ffx5yrOlqWJvbV-09r5wz.png?height=692&width=1362)\n\n很多跨链桥为了实现即时最终性，会在流动性不足的时候用替代品，也就是铸造合成资产的方式，这又牺牲了’原生资产‘这一维度。用户为了获得原生资产被迫在目标链上手动去交换中间token，而且也不安全。\n\n而如果想要同时保证前两点，就要放弃”统一流动性“，在每两个公链之间搭建一个配对的资产池，又会使得成本大增。\n\n[Stargate](https://stargateprotocol.gitbook.io/stargate/)\n\n而stargate则攻破了这种三角难题，它基于layerzero协议的网络，直接用本地资产达成链间通信，用户不需要在目标链上兑换合成资产并支付额外 gas 费用。并且它将统一的流动性池进行软分区，软分区之间可以互相借用和返还流动性，以此保证了可扩展性。在达成了”资产原生性“和”统一流动性”两点之后，最核心的是引入了 Delta () ——一种资源平衡算法对流动性进行按需分配，确保只有当系统中有足够流动性时才接受请求，从而避免了回滚的糟糕体验。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DsM6WzbsDeWKZBsy0NOFE.png?height=1264&width=1220)\n\n前不久，知名dex SushiSwap 还高票通过了集成Stargate 的提案，等到集成完成时，用户只需单击一次，（原生）资产就会放入目标链上的钱包中，操作会更加便捷。\n\n1. layerzero的扩展应用\n\n前面我们一直局限在资产跨链方面，但如果layerzero的故事只说到这里，并不会吸引来这样豪华的资金。layerzero本质是一个信息中继服务，它可以和Polkadot以及 Cosmos的IBC中的传输层功能去比较，当然跨链双雄的目标更加宏大，它们要对跨链方案进行标准化，形成万链互联，但离实用还有很长的路要走，费用也更昂贵，所以layerzero的优势之一就是其轻量级的部署有利于快速发展\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/h08Z9Pr6D9DAu8MsM7sBn.png?height=602&width=1380)\n\n而layerzero另一个潜能则在于多链NFT的应用。NFT作为一种新兴资产，逐渐衍生出了质押NFT挖矿，借贷等多种金融产品，用户需要在不同链上参与活动，所以多链NFT成为一个重要发展方向，比如Wormhole，不过市面上主要的NFT跨链桥还是锁定-铸造的方式，新链上其实发布的是NFT的副本。\n\n而4月4日，基于LayerZero 开发的NFT系列Gh0stly Gh0sts 推出，它是一组总供应量为 7710 个的幽灵图像集合，特别之处就在于——它发行时就同时支持在七条区块链上 mint，而且这些原生NFT可以直接在不同链之间实现转移，而且不同的链会影响NFT的样式，NFT的背景颜色表示出生地，而边框颜色表示当前所在地。这7710个幽灵动态分布在7条不同链上，价格综合所有链数据获得。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6JV95-5ewcH2GKXqxLMiV.png?height=1182&width=1384)\n\n这种多链的玩法吸引了众多人的目光，4 月 4 日Gh0stly Gh0sts以免费价格公开 mint之后，4 月 5 日一度冲上 OpenSea 日交易榜头名，虽然是否真的是智能互操作的全链NFT还有观察，但它的出现也说明layerzero协议在跨链应用上的潜能。\n\n5）小结\n\n总的来说，layerZero 是一个通用的信息中继服务，除了资产跨链外还可以处理很多事情，比如数据状态共享，跨链治理，借贷，抵押，全链NFT等等。\n\n目前足够的资金与机构支持能够支撑它发展，当前的激励也吸引一些资金来薅羊毛，可是激励过后是否真的有大量dapp愿意集成它呢？这些还有待观察。\n\n首先对于跨链最重要的一点就是安全，从layerzero发布以来，关于 LayerZero 的潜在漏洞和风险的争议就没中断过，根据Cobo安全团队的解读，在Oracle 完全可信的前提下，Relayer 仍可以单方面伪造receipt 数据来实现对跨链协议的攻击。虽然layerzero修复了明显漏洞，但是仍不排除还有其他被黑客攻击的可能。\n\n目前layerzero协议还没有发行 Token，可能会有空投，经济模型设计的好坏也可能影响着后续发展，对跨链感兴趣的朋友也可以参与下基于layerzero的项目，除了前面提到的项目以外，还有比如 @CatddleNFT @tinydinosnft @ParakeetDAO等。", "timestamp": 1653273245, "digest":

HTCL 深度较差。因为 HTCL 是 P2P，对于大额交易，处理时间会很长。\n2. 可扩展性较差。无法支持复杂的跨链场景，例如跨链消息传递。\n\n   # 外部验证\n\n   跨链协议依赖于外部预言机来传递跨链信息。为了提升去中心化，系统稳定性和安全性，一般跨链协议会依赖预言机网络。当预言机网络达成共识后，再将消息传递出去。预言机网络的运作很像多签钱包。\n\n   外部验证的问题在于安全性。用户需要相信预言机网络不会作恶。通常预言机节点都会质押代币，但是我们很难计算出可靠的惩罚条款。因此使用预言机网络，安全性很难被保证。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IfPep2zZ_Dmh_YUra6m6X.png?height=705&width=1280)\n\n## 本地验证\n\n在这个模式下，跨链协议在目标链上部署了轻节点。轻节点负责验证和读取源链的区块状态和通知。在区块头和交易被传递到目标链后，轻节点可以在目标链对其进行原生的验证。\n\n这个方法兼备安全和 Trustless。因为轻节点会对交易进行校验，用户不需要相信任何中间人。这样的安全和 Trustless 也是有代价的。轻节点的校验需要花费很多 Gas，并且为每条链定制一个轻节点需要大量的开发人员。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Eyqdm_UzQ81UsKh4D_yVz.png?height=705&width=1280)\n\n大部分跨链桥都使用了以上的几种技术范式，但也有例外。例如 ZKLink 和 ZKCross 使用了 ZKRU Hub 来实现跨链功能。用户在源链充值资产，用户会在 ZKRU 上获得对应的资产。之后用户在进行提现操作，就可以将 ZKRU 的资产提到目标链获。这就类似一个有着众多 Layer1 的 Layer2，跨链操作我们通过在不同 Layer1 进行充值和提现达成。ZKRU 节点对交易生成证明，并放到 Layer1。预言机网络会在不同 Layer1 中保证数据一致性。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vHoYr6TRaHkoZbKhTPJpD.png?height=547&width=1343)\n\n另一种方式类似 Tornado Cash。用户在源链充值，并生成零知识证明。用户凭借证明在目标链上进行提款。\n\n# 跨链桥的作用\n\n市面上的跨链桥大致可以分为 4 类：\n\n* 资产跨链桥\n* 为链设计\n* 为应用设计\n* 通用跨链桥\n\n## 资产跨链桥\n\n这种桥接只帮助特定资产跨链。这种桥在源链上锁定资产，并在其他链上铸造 Wrap 资产。\n\n特定资产跨链桥接很容易实现。因为桥直接铸造 Wrap 币，因此跨链桥具有无限的流动性。一个常见例子是大多数的 BTC 资产跨链桥。用户得到 Wrap 代币，例如 WBTC。\n\n## 为链设计\n\n这种桥的目的是将资产从一条链上传递到另一条链上。该桥在源链锁定代币，并在目标链释放原生或者 Wrap 代币。这种桥在桥的生态系统中很受欢迎。它对链来说具有战略价值。例如，当 Secret Network 上线时，它迅速上线了多个跨链桥。用户可以很容易地将资产导入 Secret Network。\n\n## 为应用设计\n\n这种桥是为了让应用从单链扩张到多链。使用这种桥，开发者不需要在每个链上部署完整的 Dapp 实例。相反，开发者只需在每个链上部署一个轻量级和模块化的适配器。这种模式的弊端是未来很难为 Dapp 增加更复杂的功能。这类桥的例子是 Compound Chain 和 Thorchain。\n\n## 通用跨链桥\n\n这种桥可以在链之间传递信息。Dapp 可以使用这种桥来实现跨链通信，比如调用另一条链上的智能合约。基于这种跨链通信协议，开发者可以提高多链场景下的用户体验。例如呆在一条链上，用户可以使用到其他链上的任何东西。用户不会感觉到链与链之间的差异。\n\nLayerZero 点燃了通用跨链桥的市场。一些为链设计的跨链桥正在实现自己的跨链通信协议，如 Celer 和 Anyswap。\n\n# 跨链桥评判标准\n\n与区块链中的三角困境类似，跨链桥在设计中也有自己的三角困境，大多数项目只能达到两个功能：\n\n1. 统一流动性：在 A 链上只有一个统一的流动性池子。A-B，A-C...的交易对都会使用这个 A 链上唯一池子的流动性。\n2. 即时验证确认（Instant guaranteed finality）：在交易在源链确认时，跨链交易就将在目标链确认。\n3. 原生资产：桥释放原生资产给用户，而不是 Wrap 资产。\n\n除了这个由 LayerZero 提出的三角困境，还有一个互操作性三角困境：\n\n1. Trustless\n2. 可扩展性\n3. 泛用性\n\n大部分技术方案只能三者中达到两者：\n\n* 本地验证 =  Trustless + 可扩展性\n* 外部验证 = 可扩展性 + 泛用性\n* 原生验证 = Trustless + 泛用性\n\n当我们看到一个新的跨链桥时，我们需要关注以下五个点：\n\n* 安全性：有没有安全假设。用户需要信任哪一方吗。如果资金遭到损失，安全应急措施是什么。\n* 速度：跨链交易的结算时间是多久。\n* 连接：桥支持多少链，多少种资产。\n* 资金利用率：流动性的利用效率，跨链手续费。\n* 状态：是否支持更加复杂的状态，支持跨链信息传递。\n\n# 特色跨链桥\n\n## [Multichain](https://multichain.org/)\n\nMultichain 是一个运用了外部验证的通用跨链桥。SMPC 网络用来保护 Multichain 的安全性。目前 SMPC 网络中有 32 个运行节点，但是网络并不要求质押。\n\nMultichain 目前支持 44 条链，提供了 2090 个资产跨链桥 ，拥有 56.6 亿美元的 TVL。Multichain 支持资产转移，跨链通信，和NFT桥接。\n\n如果想要[跨链通信](https://docs.multichain.org/developer-guide/anycall/how-to-integrate-cross-chain-anycall-contract)，开发者只需要实现两个接口即可。\n\n```jsx\nfunction anyCall(address _to, bytes calldata _data, address _fallback, uint256 _toChainID)\nfunction anyExec(address _from, address _to, bytes calldata _data, address _fallback, uint256 _fromChainID)\n```\n\n目前，anyCall 是需要白名单的。开发者需要联系 Multichain 团队，将他们的合约列入白名单，并在目标链上的合约中存入一些费用。anyCall 与其他竞争对手相比，它的功能和文档都比较差。\n\n## [cBridge](https://cbridge.celer.network/)\n\ncBridge 是由 Celer 开发的。cBridge 是一个外部验证的通用跨链桥。State Guardian Network（SGN）负责确保 cBridge 的安全。目前 SGN 总共有 18 个验证者和12 亿 $CELR 的质押，大约 3600 万美元的质押来确保 cBridge 7 亿美元的 TVL。如果有任何安全问题，SGN 中质押的 $CELR 将被没收。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kxz59mLYzgGGLvNBEoKEy.png?height=1013&width=1950)\n\n*Source: [The SGN as a cBridge node gateway and Service Level Agreement (SLA) arbitrator - Celer cBridge](https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/introduction/sgn-and-cbridge/the-sgn-as-a-cbridge-node-gateway-and-service-level-agreement-sla-arbitrator)*\n\ncBridge 的日交易量为 4500 万美金，日交易数量为 3000 笔。目前 cBridge 在 28 条链上有 7 亿美金 TVL。\n\n除了同质化资产跨链，cBridge 还提供两种 NFT 资产跨链的方式：\n\n1. Wrapped NFT\n2. 原生 NFT\n\n对于 Wrapped  NFT，cBridge 将锁定原始NFT，并在目标链上铸造一个 Wrapped NFT。然而，对于原生 NFT，cBridge 将在源链上烧毁原生 NFT，并在目标链上铸造一个新的。\n\n目前想要走原生 NFT 跨链方案，NFT 合约需要符合这个[模板](https://github.com/celer-network/nft-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/MCNNFT.sol)。\n\ncBridge 也为开发者提供了 [SDK](https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/developer/cbridge-sdk)。开发者接入 cBridge 只需要以下流程：\n\n1. 获取报价\n2. 链上发送交易\n\n除了支持开发者集成资产跨链功能，Celer 还支持[跨链通信](https://im-docs.celer.network/developer/celer-im-overview)。整个跨链通信附带发送资产的流程图如下：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3IXUBYU4DqO1uZ9-FNGbq.png?height=882&width=1600)\n\n*Source: [Celer IM Design Patterns - Celer Inter-chain Message (IM)](https://im-docs.celer.network/developer/celer-im-design-patterns)*\n\n资产的跨链将通过 cBridge，SGN 和执行器负责传递消息。\n\n与 LayerZero 类似，开发者只需要在智能合约中添加[两个函数](https://github.com/celer-network/sgn-v2-contracts/blob/main/contracts/message/framework/MessageSenderApp.sol)就可以实现消息传递。与 LayerZero 相比，Celer 额外支持传递消息的同时，发送资产。\n\n```jsx\n// Send message\nMessageSenderLib.sendMessageWithTransfer()\nMessageSenderLib.sendTokenTransfer()\n// Receive message\nexecuteMessageWithTransfer\n```\n\n## [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/)\n\n我的同事 Iris 为 LayerZero 写了一篇[单独的研报](https://mirror.xyz/0xc8C025c0B79472300b280d212B3d631c27f0423a/iTgi0Of9ubPkkHnqMVypFsHCyfKdXbGoSpvO3iUU5Ug)。\n\n简单来说，LayerZero 混合了外部验证和原生验证来实现通用跨链桥，并支持跨链通讯。\n\n基于 LayerZero 的开发生态也非常活跃。开发者只需要使用以下函数：\n\n```jsx\n function send(\n    uint16 _dstChainId, \n    bytes calldata _dstContractAddress, \n    bytes calldata _payload, \n    address payable _refundAddress, \n    address _zroPaymentAddress, \n    bytes calldata _adapterParams\n) external payable;\n\nfunction lzReceive(\n    uint16 _srcChainId, \n    bytes calldata _srcAddress, \n    uint64 _nonce, \n    bytes calldata _payload\n) external;\n```\n\nLayerZero 有一个活跃的社区。LayerZero 团队基于 LayerZero 协议实现了 Stargate 跨链桥。社区基于 LayerZero 推出了为跨链 NFT 定制的库 [ERC-721O](https://catddle.medium.com/erc721o-e6c9a0ae09e1)。\n\n## ChainPort\n\nChainPort 是一个依赖外部验证的跨链桥。它支持 7 条链，有 2 亿 TVL，跨链结算时间大约为 2.5 分钟。再 ChainPort 上任何人都可以添加需要跨链的新资产，上币不需要审核。在未来，ChainPort 计划推出保险来保证 LP 不用承担损失，并将使用 ML 来检测可疑交易。\n\n开发者可以集成 ChainPort 至他们的智能合约来实现资产跨链：\n\n```jsx\nfunction depositTokens(\n    address token, \n    uint256 amount, \n    unit256 networkId\n)\nfunction burnTokens(\n    address bridgeToken, \n    uint256 amount\n)\nfunction crossChainTransfer(\n        address bridgeToken,\n        uint256 amount,\n        uint256 networkId\n )\n```\n\n## [Nil Foundation](https://blog.nil.foundation/)\n\n=nil 推出了 Mina 到 以太坊，Mina 到 Polygon 跨链应用基础设施  [Demo](https://verify.mina.nil.foundation/walkthrough/index.html)。\n\n简单来说这个基础设施让以太坊或者 Polygon 上的应用可以直接验证 Mina 状态的有效性。这些跨链应用不用再担心会有人传递恶意假数据了。\n\n这个基础设施可以对 Mina 区块链的状态生成证明，并且在以太坊或者 Polygon 上进行验证。未来的跨链应用可以直接使用以太坊或者 Polygon 上 Mina 的状态证明来检验数据的有效性。例如中继节点传递了一笔交易，我们可以用这个基础设施提供的 Mina 状态证明来检验这笔交易的有效性。跨链消息传递也将从用博弈论来保证消息的有效性来到用数学来保证交易的有效性。\n\n在 Demo 中，生成证明需要 1min 左右。在 Polygon 和以太坊上需要大约 2.5m 的 Gas。如果是 80 的 Gas Price，那大约是 0.5 ETH 的燃料费。\n\n一个基于此的资产跨链桥将符合以下几个步骤：\n\n1. 跨链桥在 Mina 上锁定 $Mina\n2. 此基础设施生成 Mina 状态证明\n3. 此基础设施将 Mina 状态证明提交至以太坊上\n4. 以太坊链上合约验证状态证明的有效性\n5. 以太坊链上合约接收并存储 Mina 状态证明，如果证明有效。\n6. 跨链桥在以太坊链上检验 Mina 和交易状态，释放 $WMINA。\n\n在未来，或许我们可以在更多的 EVM 上链直接验证 Mina 状态的有效性。不过需要注意的是，以太坊状态证明还不能在 Mina 链上进行验证。\n\n# 跨链桥生态\n\n## [LI.FI](https://li.fi/)\n\n[LI.FI](http://LI.FI) 是一个对开发者友好的跨链桥和 DEX 聚合器。用户可以将源链上的代币换成目的链上的另一种代币。[LI.FI](http://LI.FI) 目前支持 Connext、Hop、cBridge、Multichain、Hyphen、Optimism、Polygon、Arbitrum 和 Avalanche 跨链桥。对于代币交易，[LI.FI](http://LI.FI) 支持 Parawap、1inch、0x、Dodo、Uniswap、Sushiswap、Quickswap、Honeyswap、Pancakeswap、Spookyswap、Spiritswap、Solarbeam、Beamswap 和 ubeswap。\n\n基于 [LI.FI](http://LI.FI) SDK，[LI.FI](http://LI.FI) 团队实现了  transferto.xyz。用户可以自定义滑点，交易各种代币。\n\n对于开发者，[LI.FI](http://LI.FI) 提供了许多集成的方式。如果开发者不想要自定义，那可以直接使用 `iframe`\n\n集成，只需要 5 分钟。如果需要自定义，开发者可以使用 Node.js API 来发送跨链交易。\n\n[LI.FI](http://LI.FI) 最近推出了一键跨链 Staking 的功能。用户在跨链交易后，还可以自动把代币质押到对应的池子中获得奖励。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/w1Y0lTuz0U3MedVVoIoZ_.png?height=543&width=1263)\n\n*Source: [Li.Fi](http://Li.Fi)*\n\n[LI.FI](http://LI.FI) 有 2.5 亿美金的日交易量，以及 186 笔日交易。\n\n# 代币经济\n\n大多数跨链桥的代币都是治理代币，仅拥有投票权。少数代币质押后可以分享整个协议的收入。这些跨链桥代币也用作提供流动性的奖励，和平衡各个流动性池的深度。\n\n跨链桥 XY Finance 融了 1200 万美元，但其 ATH 市值仅为 800 万美元。现在它的市值为 300 万美元。在大多数情况下，跨链桥代币就和 DEX 矿币一样。因为排量大，跨链桥代币的表现总是很差。开发者仍在为目前可有可无的跨链桥代币寻找合适的应用场景。作为投资者，我们需要谨慎对待跨链桥代币经济学。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aIL3_pqYu1ijyBl-XKrZe.png?height=816&width=1068)\n\n*Source: coingecko*\n\n# 安全风险\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TpZ0Zwh3Rbsgm9bkOroj7.png?height=501&width=520)\n\n在过去一年中，跨链桥安全事件一共造成了约 12 亿美元的损失。跨链桥费用约为每笔交易的 5‱。Multichain 是跨链桥龙头之一。Multichain 30 天的交易量是 50 亿美元。一年的交易量约为 700 亿美元。那么协议收益约为 3500 万美元。可以肯定的是，跨链桥市场的收入仍然低于攻击者偷走的资金。\n\n由于复杂性，开发真很难保证跨链桥的安全性。回顾这些安全事件后，攻击者几乎是利用了完全不同的漏洞。攻击者们总是能在复杂系统的各个部分找到漏洞。\n\n在 Polynetwork 安全事件中，攻击者利用了权限相关的漏洞：\n\n1. 执行者合约没有检查函数输入。执行者合约不通过验证，执行任意的跨链交易。\n2. 执行者合约有修改 Keeper 的权限。Keeper 对整个系统至关重要。\n\n攻击者通过跨链交易，改变了 Keeper。虽然攻击者没有改变 Keeper 的权限，但有此权限的执行者合约帮助攻击者做到了这一点。因此，攻击者成功盗取了 60 亿美元的资金。\n\n在 Ronin 跨链桥攻击中，攻击者通过入侵 RPC 服务器窃取了管理员的私钥。\n\n攻击者在不断发现新的攻击向量。我们不知道跨链桥的下一个安全漏洞会是什么。跨链桥很复杂。因此开发者很难保证桥的安全。此外，我们并没有通用，安全的跨链桥开发标准和库。开发者按照他们的想法实现着跨链桥。这类似于开发者在没有使用 Openzeppelin ERC20 库的情况下开发代币合约。如果有一个安全和易于使用的跨链桥开发库，跨链桥的安全性将更进一步。\n\n# 总结\n\n目前常见的跨链桥设计有 3 种：\n\n* 本地验证\n* 外部验证\n* 原生验证\n\n跨链桥按照功能可以分为 4 种：\n\n* 资产跨链\n* 为链设计\n* 为应用设计\n* 通用跨链桥\n\n当我们看到一个新的跨链桥时，我们应该在意它在这几个方面的表现：\n\n* 资金利用率\n* 连接性\n* 安全\n* 速度\n* 状态性\n\n跨链桥市场的竞争非常激烈。新项目需要面对安全和流动性上的考验。在跨链桥生态中，还有以下机会：\n\n* 跨 Layer 跨链桥：这个市场还不拥挤。在未来，更多的交易量将从 Layer1 移动到 Layer2。这也意味着跨 Layer 跨链桥可以获得更多的协议收入。\n* 新的代币经济学：目前没有人知道如何在跨链桥项目中合理的使用代币。大多数代币是治理代币，用来确保整个跨链中继网络的安全。然而经常发生项目实际情况和代币价格不吻合的情况，例如 TVL 增加，但是代币价格下跌之类的。\n* 跨链桥库：帮助开发者快速开发跨链桥，将单链 Dapp 扩展为全链 Dapp。\n* 跨链桥聚合器：市面上有数不胜数的跨链桥，有着不一样的速度，流动深度，滑点，手续费。用户很难选择出最合适的一款跨链桥。跨链桥聚合器可以让用户以最优惠的价格进行跨链交易，并且提供统一的 UI 和 UX。这正如 DeFi 里，DEX 的繁荣过后，聚合器应运而生。除了价格优惠，跨链聚合器可以帮助入门用户触及不同链上的更多 Dapp，降低多链使用门槛。如果说多链钱包是优化体验，那么跨链聚合器就是让用户感受不到链与链之间的区别。触及更多的链，也代表用户可以或多更多的流动性。\n* ZK 桥：ZK 桥可以提供给更快捷，便宜，安全的跨链体验。当我们可以将一条链的状态搬到另一条链后，开发者也可以基于此类基础设施更加安全快捷的开发跨链应用。=nil 在 Solana 和 Mina 上有了很大的进步。\n\n  #

已经提前生成并记录在了合约里。每当一个 Ghost 的图片公开了以后，任何人都可以验证图片的完整性和图片的位置（也就是 Token ID）。\n\n所以，我这会儿说的稀有款，它的编号 #205 和它的图片内容，都是提前已经确定好的。而“提前确定好的图片内容和位置“这两个事实，任何人都可以在图片公开以后验证。\n\n同理，未来开图以后，看到的每一张图，它的顺序和内容也已经提前确定，并且可以被验证，这样以确保未来开图过程的公平。\n\n### 那比如说，如何验证上面这张图？\n\n现在这个 HippyGhosts #205 提前开图，我需要验证，这个图不是我现在临时决定的，并且这个图，我在 mint 之前，已经把它排在了 9999 个图中的第 205 位。\n\n首先，在新窗口打开这个图片，浏览器中可以看到这个图片的 base64 编码，这就是图片的数据，对这个数据进行 `keccak256` 哈希后，得到\n\n`0bf413340f0db024d3621259bc4140f9defad64ac78725d90f569a131be561f4`\n\n然后在 HippyGhosts 的 MerkleTree 中寻找这一串哈希，位置为第 205 个叶子结点\n\n`https://api.hippyghosts.io/~/storage/merkletree`\n\n因为这个 MerkleTree 是在 HippyGhosts 自己的服务器上的，接下来就是确认它的数据是否可信，首先从 MerkleTree 的第一行获得 MerkleRoot\n\n`58d247a687ef48f010e2e6107a04d575787163cfb0d70543c421a5001e9f5aab`\n\n同时这个 MerkleRoot 数据也存在于 HippyGhosts 的 Renderer 合约源代码中\n\n`https://etherscan.io/address/0x856bd414d7c4718f844795b30510af2f5fee2ee1#code#F9#L10`\n\n这里要提起一个叫做隔离见证的东西，意思就是：就是一个结果的出现，需要依赖于一个事实的发生。在这个例子中，**结果**就是 MerkleRoot，**事实**就是所有图片的内容和顺序。\n\n`58d247a687ef48f010e2e6107a04d575787163cfb0d70543c421a5001e9f5aab`\n\n现在我们在合约代码中发现了**结果**（即MerkleRoot），这个结果是在合约部署的时候就出现了，自然就是在 mint 之前，那么，所有图片的内容和顺序这个**事实**也一定发生在合约部署之前。这是因为根据 MerkleTree 的特点，如果图片的内容和顺序不同，MerkleRoot 也会变化，那么对于一个确定的 MerkleRoot，就一定有确定的图片内容和顺序。\n\n讲完了，当然这不是公平开图的最有思路，只是我自己比较喜欢用 MerkleTree 来处理它。如果在公平开图这个事情上有其他想法，欢迎交流。\n\n🔗 <https://muselink.cc/web3nomad>", "timestamp": 1653273852, "digest": "dt6V7LiKCRjrJD2dBlucd0JFm8jwkjxN3Ictb8osS5g", "contributor":

已经提前生成并记录在了合约里。每当一个 Ghost 的图片公开了以后，任何人都可以验证图片的完整性和图片的位置（也就是 Token ID）。\n\n所以，我这会儿说的稀有款，它的编号 #205 和它的图片内容，都是提前已经确定好的。而“提前确定好的图片内容和位置“这两个事实，任何人都可以在图片公开以后验证。\n\n同理，未来开图以后，看到的每一张图，它的顺序和内容也已经提前确定，并且可以被验证，这样以确保未来开图过程的公平。\n\n### 那比如说，如何验证上面这张图？\n\n现在这个 HippyGhosts #205 提前开图，我需要验证，这个图不是我现在临时决定的，并且这个图，我在 mint 之前，已经把它排在了 9999 个图中的第 205 位。\n\n首先，在新窗口打开这个图片，浏览器中可以看到这个图片的 base64 编码，这就是图片的数据，对这个数据进行 `keccak256` 哈希后，得到\n\n`0bf413340f0db024d3621259bc4140f9defad64ac78725d90f569a131be561f4`\n\n然后在 HippyGhosts 的 MerkleTree 中寻找这一串哈希，位置为第 205 个叶子结点\n\n`https://api.hippyghosts.io/~/storage/merkletree`\n\n因为这个 MerkleTree 是在 HippyGhosts 自己的服务器上的，接下来就是确认它的数据是否可信，首先从 MerkleTree 的第一行获得 MerkleRoot\n\n`58d247a687ef48f010e2e6107a04d575787163cfb0d70543c421a5001e9f5aab`\n\n同时这个 MerkleRoot 数据也存在于 HippyGhosts 的 Renderer 合约源代码中\n\n`https://etherscan.io/address/0x856bd414d7c4718f844795b30510af2f5fee2ee1#code#F9#L10`\n\n这里要提起一个叫做隔离见证的东西，意思就是：就是一个结果的出现，需要依赖于一个事实的发生。在这个例子中，**结果**就是 MerkleRoot，**事实**就是所有图片的内容和顺序。\n\n`58d247a687ef48f010e2e6107a04d575787163cfb0d70543c421a5001e9f5aab`\n\n现在我们在合约代码中发现了**结果**（即MerkleRoot），这个结果是在合约部署的时候就出现了，自然就是在 mint 之前，那么，所有图片的内容和顺序这个**事实**也一定发生在合约部署之前。这是因为根据 MerkleTree 的特点，如果图片的内容和顺序不同，MerkleRoot 也会变化，那么对于一个确定的 MerkleRoot，就一定有确定的图片内容和顺序。\n\n讲完了，当然这不是公平开图的最有思路，只是我自己比较喜欢用 MerkleTree 来处理它。如果在公平开图这个事情上有其他想法，欢迎交流。\n\n🔗 <https://muselink.cc/web3nomad>", "timestamp": 1653274031, "digest": "dt6V7LiKCRjrJD2dBlucd0JFm8jwkjxN3Ictb8osS5g", "contributor":

Ruiz 说：“我亲眼目睹了供应商和保险公司用于数据采集的医疗保健系统存在巨大缺陷。” “因此，我们开发了 LifeWallet，这是一个与众不同的强大生态系统，允许患者优化健康记录并为提供者提供宝贵资源，从而提高登记效率并改善患者治疗效果。” \n\nLifeWallet 是 MSP Recovery 面向消费者的应用程序，允许个人访问他们的病史和救生资源，同时从平台向供应商提供宝贵的资源。付款人和提供者还可以使用该应用程序来确认医疗保健服务的适当治疗和付款。LifeWallet 由 MSP Recovery 的复杂数据分析提供支持，可在符合 HIPPA 的高度安全平台上做出明智的决策并改善患者护理，从而帮助挽救生命。\n\n“这种伙伴关系将使我们能够利用区块链的全部功能来提供一种医疗保健产品，这将彻底改变患者和提供者的体验，”Tokenology 联合创始人 John Weiser 说。“LifeChain 的目标是改善尽可能多的人的生活，同时让他们能够控制自己的医疗数据和支付。”\n\n通过 LifeChain，医疗供应商可以期望通过提高效率和更高的回收率将其收入每年至少增加 30%。保险公司的欺诈行为可以减少多达 90%，有助于减轻美国医疗保健系统的重大负担。\n\nPolygon 的联合创始人 Sandeep Nailwal 表示：“像 Tokenology 这样的开发人员正在使用 Polygon 技术构建的进取新解决方案的演变证明了这些真正有影响力和影响广泛的项目。” “我们很自豪能够为具有如此可扩展性需求和同样雄心壮志的项目提供所需的基础设施、安全性和可靠性。”", "timestamp": 1653274094, "digest": "H5G0Y4JkfMneri0YzfrTCDA4vifMMmPXudHAA3STWNA", "contributor": "0x31d61b448700D321536FF36A2cd299a1dea14CA2"}

At least here we are guaranteed one small bite of relief. \n\nOut in the rest of the house I take up too much space. My inside voice is too loud for the people I didn’t realize were listening. I move through the halls, murmuring incantations to myself, taking note of the light and the terracotta. \n\nSilently memorizing the things that are unwanted. \n\nWhen I was young, the world was a place to be explored but here, in the house, there are ears behind every closed door, and eyes examining me from the shadows. When I was younger, we tried our best to help but in the house, there is a way things should be done. There are unwritten rules on how the floor should be swept and the door to be closed — and you would be a fool to not, you goddamn fool, you stupid girl. There are unwritten rules you must intuit, or maybe you are told, but no one told me. At least not until it was too late. \n\nMy mother told me life was a game. I was too young to realize, games are not meant to be fun. \n\nYou stupid girl. \n\nWhen I was younger I believed our lives were meant to be lived in ever-expanding circles; I am a pebble, waiting on the expanse of the pond, dripping ripples that move outwards til they touch the banks of Elysium. Now that I am older, I know the circles of life are contracting. Here in the house, the admonition pushes me backward; my explorations move from the hallway, to the door, to the corners then the recesses of my own mind until all I dare explore is the kitchen. \n\nA woman’s place is in the kitchen. In the kitchen, there is no shame in looking down. That’s what they want of you, after all, but they hate you when you do it. \n\n --- \n\nA version of the first line of Berry Cobbler was originally published as the poetry couplet for [Desert Minis 116 berry cobbler](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/86756770768904532488236702972486454057254131491409441498843533364350198743041).

已经提前生成并记录在了合约里。每当一个 Ghost 的图片公开了以后，任何人都可以验证图片的完整性和图片的位置（也就是 Token ID）。\n\n所以，我这会儿说的稀有款，它的编号 #205 和它的图片内容，都是提前已经确定好的。而“提前确定好的图片内容和位置“这两个事实，任何人都可以在图片公开以后验证。\n\n同理，未来开图以后，看到的每一张图，它的顺序和内容也已经提前确定，并且可以被验证，这样以确保未来开图过程的公平。\n\n### 那比如说，如何验证上面这张图？\n\n现在这个 HippyGhosts #205 提前开图，我需要验证，这个图不是我现在临时决定的，并且这个图，我在 mint 之前，已经把它排在了 9999 个图中的第 205 位。\n\n首先，在新窗口打开这个图片，浏览器中可以看到这个图片的 base64 编码，这就是图片的数据，对这个数据进行 `keccak256` 哈希后，得到\n\n`0bf413340f0db024d3621259bc4140f9defad64ac78725d90f569a131be561f4`\n\n然后在 HippyGhosts 的 MerkleTree 中寻找这一串哈希，位置为第 205 个叶子结点\n\n`https://api.hippyghosts.io/~/storage/merkletree`\n\n因为这个 MerkleTree 是在 HippyGhosts 自己的服务器上的，接下来就是确认它的数据是否可信，首先从 MerkleTree 的第一行获得 MerkleRoot\n\n`58d247a687ef48f010e2e6107a04d575787163cfb0d70543c421a5001e9f5aab`\n\n同时这个 MerkleRoot 数据也存在于 HippyGhosts 的 Renderer 合约源代码中\n\n`https://etherscan.io/address/0x856bd414d7c4718f844795b30510af2f5fee2ee1#code#F9#L10`\n\n这里要提起一个叫做隔离见证的东西，意思就是：就是一个结果的出现，需要依赖于一个事实的发生。在这个例子中，**结果**就是 MerkleRoot，**事实**就是所有图片的内容和顺序。\n\n`58d247a687ef48f010e2e6107a04d575787163cfb0d70543c421a5001e9f5aab`\n\n现在我们在合约代码中发现了**结果**（即MerkleRoot），这个结果是在合约部署的时候就出现了，自然就是在 mint 之前，那么，所有图片的内容和顺序这个**事实**也一定发生在合约部署之前。这是因为根据 MerkleTree 的特点，如果图片的内容和顺序不同，MerkleRoot 也会变化，那么对于一个确定的 MerkleRoot，就一定有确定的图片内容和顺序。\n\n讲完了，当然这不是公平开图的最有思路，只是我自己比较喜欢用 MerkleTree 来处理它。如果在公平开图这个事情上有其他想法，欢迎交流。\n\n🔗 <https://muselink.cc/web3nomad>", "timestamp": 1653274530, "digest": "dt6V7LiKCRjrJD2dBlucd0JFm8jwkjxN3Ictb8osS5g", "contributor":

Deversifi DEX（有代币）；\n3. Immutable NFT 市场；\n4. Sorare 运动收藏品；\n\n其他一些尚未推出的协议，我认为需要注意的是这些：\n\n1. ZKEX 的多链 DEX；\n2. Sithswap AMM；\n3. ZkLend 借贷；\n4. Aave <> Starknet 交互；\n5. CurveZero 一个固定利率的贷款协议；\n6. Fujifinance，贷款再平衡器；\n\n对于 StarkNET Alpha 主网，我们现在能做的不多，这不是 Goerli，这是 StarkNET 主网。他们在几天前推出了 StarkGATE（他们的跨链桥），用户将他们的 ETH 从以太坊生态发送至 StarkWARE 主网。\n\n如果你对零知识证明感兴趣，并且想获得他们的空投与代币奖励，你可以通过我提供的策略来完成他们的一些测试。\n\n【welcome to join us】 \n WeChat1：victeam005 \n WeChat2：shijie20170405 \n Telegream：[https://t.me/VICOINDAOCHAT](https://weibo.cn/sinaurl?u=https%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2FVICOINDAOCHAT) \n Twitter：[@VICOINDAO](https://weibo.com/n/VICOINDAO)", "timestamp": 1653274431, "digest": "sstOvfIdbN1sPaxKuBL3MsQOmz2yOL8SS5SWgdTtrdE", "contributor": "0xf6e546668c397dcb64767efe331904Ba147D5025"}

智能合约账户 - 网络钓鱼预防 - 消息+通知 -DAO 工具 - 价格信息 -L2 快照 -协议快照 - 硬件钱包快照 -龙卷风现金快照 ，＆ 多得多。 所有这些都在为代币酝酿完美风暴。 社区的控制力越来越强，Metamask 获得了创纪录的收入。 这将在未来几个月内成为前 10 名代币。 敬请关注。下面有更多的阿尔法……\nOpenSea 的 Seaport 公告让人联想到一个转折点。 2018 年，UNI V1 仅支持 ETH -

{"id": "vj4fkz5IYsCFy7laJlGYfJHznPeLz6_w48Az6dC4INk", "title": "What are ENS-addresses and how did they manage to reach over 5 million USD in daily volume?", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Znst9jN-zLqjUWB0VhRWn.png?height=530&width=1200)\n\nThe [Ethereum Name Service](https://opensea.io/collection/ens?search\\[sortAscending\\]=true&search\\[sortBy\\]=PRICE) (ENS) recorded over 2.800 ETH in daily volume in the beginning of May. Floor-prices exploded for three-and four-digit ENS-domains and also the accompanying governance-token almost doubled in this timespan to a market capitalization of 450 million USD. Why did ENS take off recently and what is behind it?  \n\n**What is ENS?**\n\nENS is a naming service, which converts the 42 characters of an ethereum-address into a readable text-string, similar to DNS-domains. In the early days of the internet people used IP-addresses to find and look for websites. With the innovation of domains, it was possible to translate the IP-address 54.151.173.24 into the domain [ofr.asia](https://www.ofr.asia/). ENS works in a similar way, with the exception that it stores the data in a decentralised way and that it also stores the wallet-address, giving people the opportunity to donate funds directly to the ENS-domain. \n\nThe domain is built on smart-contracts backed by the Ethereum blockchain, thus inheriting the advantages of decentralisation and security. DNS-websites are stored centrally on servers, making it vulnerable to attackers. In contrast, ENS-websites are stored across the whole Ethereum-ecosystem. The structure is the same as with DNS, giving the holder all rights to sub-domains. This means if you hold the domain abc.eth, you are also holding mail.abc.eth and work.abc.eth.\n\nThe initiative was launched by Alex Van de Sande and Nick Johnson within the Ethereum foundation in 2017. In 2018, it separated from the Ethereum foundation and is now managed by [The True Names LTD ](https://ens.domains/de/about/), a Singaporean non-profit organisation. In November 2021, ENS issued their governance token and converted the company into a DAO. To ensure a smooth process of upgrades and maintenance, the [ENS-root](https://ens.domains/de/about/) is currently under the supervision of a four to seven parted multisig, with members of partnered organisations as key-holders: Nick Johnson, ENS; Sergey Nazarov, Chainlink; Dan Finlay, Metamask etc. are all holding a key.\n\nIn the future, the organisation plans to have a more fairly distributed decision-making system.\n\nThe [mission](https://ens.domains/de/about/) of the project is that the foundation of the internet infrastructure belongs to the general public and is focused on community decision-making and fair distribution. This differentiates them from their competitors like [unstoppable domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/?utm_source=paid_google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_term=unstoppable%20domains&utm_content=123614451481&utm_campaign=AO_bau_con_paid_google_search_brand_KPI-su-pur-roas_keywords_\\~_\\~&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-JyUBhCuARIsANUqQ_KU9xshUxkL-DJfz6dDviOqcltYgEADW-oV5CtsFhBkNLr7uQsWg4AaAiKxEALw_wcB), which are businesses primarily focused to make profits. This is also reflected in its price-structure. While unstoppable domains do not have an expiration date and are only payed once, ENS have yearly costs and a fixed time-span to prevent spams and random spaculations.They are spending severe time in developing a system which serves the community the best. The price for ENS-domains are paid up-front for the whole time-span and are currently 5 $ per year. To extend the time-span of your domain, you have to pay extra for four and three character-long domains, naimly 160$ and 640$ per year.\n\n**But what exactly caused the recent upswing?**\n\nOnce someone buys a .eth-domain, an NFT is minted which can be traded on Opensea and other marketplaces. This has led to several twitter-influencers starting to post about how prestigious it would be to own one of only 999 three-digit domains. Hours later sales took off, buying out not only all three-, but also all four-digit domain-names. For example, 555.eth has been sold for 55,5 Eth, which are currently worth over 110k USD. A three-digit domain-holder and guest on the bankless-podcast compared it to the culture in the middle east, where a low digit-licence plate is much more of a status-symbol than the luxurious car that has it on. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2M623cKg582OWlKqc24rG.png?height=680&width=536)\n\nOut of that storm of sales the 999-Club (three-digits) and the [10K club](https://twitter.com/10kClubOfficial) (four-digits) have been established, driving the sale-prices even higher with the meme: [I am my digits, my digits are me](https://twitter.com/10kClubOfficial/status/1521700594536566784). Soon a discord emerged with over 7k members within a few days, an impressive growth, all happening organically. According to members the community is very passionate and keen to network, build relationships and connect with other people from the crypto-world. \n\nThe scarcity factor attracted a lot of other crypto-native people, especially for the four-digit domains. It became popular for holders to buy the digit correlated to their ID of other popular collections. For example, a BAYC-holder with the tag #1234 wants to own 1234.eth. \n\nThe 10K-Club follows the mentality “buy first, build later”, with most of the structure just being developed after the spontaneous community-initiative. A treasury is planned, as well as a DAO. The community gets a lot of help from members which have great connections to diverse companies and also a lot of web3-native organisations offered their help. \n\nMoreover, the 10K-Club is currently working together with ENS-employees to potentially launch their own marketplace/collection for the four-digit-domains.\n\nTo conclude, ENS is a DAO which sells customizable ethereum-addresses and -domains. Three- and four-digit domains fueled an unprecedented growth of sales and attention for ENS, establishing the 999- and 10K-Club as prestigious NFT-collections. The future will show if this is only a short-lived hype-wave or a long-lasting development of one of the most elite NFT-collections in the world.\n\n**Sources**\n\n*10k Club (@10kClubOfficial) | Twitter*.

{"id": "VtZLJwqhynrlXDUY9A39TLOSonlwPOgdPSNMLLZjD6c", "title": "Web3的灵魂离我们还有多远？DID赛道现状、展望与投资建议", "body": "## 核心观点\n\n1. 赛道重要性：去中心化身份（DID）是Web3的枢纽，是应用层发展的瓶颈\n2. 项目分类：DID项目形态繁多，可大致划分为链下身份认证类、链上身份聚合类、链上信用评分类、链上行为认证类\n3. 未来发展：DID处于早期探索阶段，需要解决三大问题 —— 产品形态问题、数字人与真人之争、隐私保护问题\n4. 投资建议：不推荐短线投资；可考虑用风投思维，在熊市底部时买入看好项目的代币做长期持有，等待其未来的爆发\n\n## 一、DID是当前Web3应用层发展的瓶颈\n\n为什么我们需要一个**去中心化的身份（DID，Decentralized Identity）系统**?\n\n用大白话讲，现在Web3中的交互都是基于钱包地址的，但是创建新地址的成本几乎可以忽略不计，也少有人会把自己绑定在一个地址上。这就导致了用户可以随时放弃一个地址所代表的“身份”，也可以零成本创建大量的地址“身份”，进而导致一系列问题。\n\n对于此现象，V神及其合作伙伴近期也在长文《中心化社会：寻找Web3的灵魂》中进行了指出：**他们认为，Web3目前在应用层存在相当的局限性，而这种局限性源自当前Web3 缺乏代表“人类的身份以及社交关系”的原生组件。这导致许多应用在实现关键功能的时候，必须依赖于其原本想超越的中心化Web2架构，从而复制了后者的局限性，无法实现Web3闭环**。\n\n典型的案例有：\n\n1. 当前的DeFi由于无法构建地址与“真人”的联系，无法实现不少现实中常见的经济活动，比如抵押物不足的借贷。\n2. DAO如果想实现（有代币门槛的）“一人一票”投票机制，往往得依赖web2的基础设施，如社交媒体个人资料，来对抗女巫攻击（用程序生成大量机器人模拟真人行为）。\n3. Web3建设者在各个DAO建设中都做出了贡献，但这种贡献却无法直接与其链上的身份绑定，导致其在求职时可能依然需要走Web2的简历填写等流程。\n4. 一些NFT项目声称自己是由某知名艺术家创作的，但这种创作无法在链上得到直接验证。用户只有通过Web2社交媒体联系艺术家来验证真伪，若无法联系或得不到及时澄清，容易上当受骗。\n\n因此，Web3原生身份组件的构建，对于Web3的进一步繁荣发展是至关重要的。行业内一般称这类身份组件为去中心化身份（DID）。\n\n## 二、DID的枢纽位置与应用场景\n\nAmber Group，全球顶级的crypto金融服务商，于2021年11月勾勒了DID的生态系统，详见下图：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6jTUS1eIVJbuF1MJfmExt.png?height=1470&width=1430)\n\n在这幅图中，DID位于Layer3，处于整个生态的枢纽位置。\n\n在DID的上游，是Layer1-共识标准层和Layer2-基础设施：\n\n* 共识标准层可以简单理解为对Web3身份表示的各种标准规范的制定，目前主要参与方是为W3C（万维网联盟）和DIF（去中心化身份基金会）\n* 基础设施层中，**最值得关注的是.bit、ENS等域名项目 —— 由于域名可以绑定地址、地址本身难以记忆，未来Web3世界中每个人的“姓名”很可能会以域名的形式进行展示**。\n\n在DID的下游，是众多依赖于DID的应用项目。**个人认为，当前对DID最为迫切的三类应用项目，是不完全抵押借贷、DAO治理工具、Web3社交**：\n\n* 不完全抵押借贷曾是Defi中的一大探索方向，曾经也有Goldfinch等有一定影响力的项目，但它们并不成功，TVL接近归0；但是，如果有了身份约束、甚至链下真人的唯一性认证，用户就不得不考虑到违约所要付出的信用成本，这和真实世界借贷相类似。\n* 在DAO治理投票、包括项目对早期用户贡献的衡量中，如何识别哪些用户为真人、哪些是机器人一直是一大难题。当DID成熟之后，DAO治理也将会走向新的高度。\n* Web3原生的社交项目目前并没有非常成功的，其中的一个因素就是缺少现实真人在链上的实体映射：每个用户可能有多个地址，且地址之间的交易局限于金融行为而缺少社交行为。DID的出现将为Web3社交项目的发展提供新思路。\n\n值得注意的是，由于DID目前的成熟形态尚不清晰，不少DID项目的分类在不同的地方也不一样，这个问题也将会在后文进行探讨。有时候一些本属于socialfi、defi类的赛道也会被归为DID赛道的项目，对此我们不必纠结。\n\n下面，让我们来看看当前的DID项目是如何做出解决上述问题的尝试的。\n\n## 三、DID项目的大致划分及其代表方案\n\n上文提到，Web3中不同的应用场景都对DID提出了需求。**对于不同需求的侧重，当前的DID项目可以大致划分为四类：链下身份认证类、链上身份聚合类、链上信用评分类、链上行为认证类**。**值得强调的是，这种分类并不是说DID可以细分为四个赛道或者模式，未来DID一定是一个整体，其中有各种组成部分**。\n\n### 3.1 链下身份认证\n\n将链下的真人身份信息与链上地址绑定，是一个看似有吸引力的解决Web3身份问题的方案：\n\n假设一个人毕业于斯坦福大学，曾在谷歌当工程师，在硅谷有两套房产。如果上述信息能够得到认证而与这个人持有的一个地址绑定，那么这些链下的荣誉和财产也将为他在链上的社交、借贷等各种活动提供加持 —— 比如他想认识斯坦福的校友，抑或是他希望进行一些抵押率相对较低的借贷。\n\n**然而，现阶段如果想要做信息层面的绑定验证，是相当困难的。这其中最关键的原因，在于这些链下行为无法在链上得到验证，从而使得其审核依赖于中心化机构**。比如想实现一个简单的工作单位认证，都需要这些工作单位配合上链进行审核操作，考虑到当前Web3的大众普及率和上手门槛，这对于项目的推广是相当困难的；更进一步的，如果要做工作中的项目经历认证，更是为审查困难、串谋作弊提供了可能 —— 毕竟这些东西都不在链上。\n\n因此，希望挑战链下信息验证的项目寥寥无几。在A16Z去年11月的文章中，提到Violet项目在做这方面的尝试，不过其官网仍没有其具体方案的展示。\n\n既然如此，现在涉及到链下身份的DID项目，更多的侧重于“唯一真人身份绑定”。这还是有比较成熟的技术方案的，那就是视频人脸识别。\n\nBrightID是真人身份验证的代表性项目，目前其已有超过5.7万名用户。用户需要预约zoom视频会议，通过人脸识别和验证官的复核来做BrightID的唯一身份认证；如果用户之前已经做过认证，就无法再创建新的账号，只能申请身份恢复。\n\n![BrightID APP的主界面](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tfMryU5b5vi4aIqiypfsv.png?height=1926&width=3292)\n\n![BrightID通过Zoom视频会议进行唯一性认证](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J-8sX-xRcUaJx6qGr2mBg.png?height=1922&width=3638)\n\nBrightID的当前主要应用场景，来自部分项目方开展项目时的“一人一号”需求，如比如经过BrightID认证后才能领空投。目前Gitcoin、RabbitHole、Status 等多个项目都已经采用BrightID。\n\n除了BrightID以外，Verite也是个值得关注的身份标准。它由UDSC的发行方Circle公司于5月10日推出，其中KYC是其身份验证的关键之一，具体KYC的形式和产品的设计有待项目方进一步披露。不过个人认为，视频人脸认证是比要提供护照、身份证等进一步真人隐私信息等KYC更合适的方案。\n\n### 3.2 链上身份聚合\n\n**这类的DID项目并没有关注用户线下的情况，而是通过“数字身份”这一概念，来实现用户的链上信息的聚合管理，甚至进而成为用户在web3世界的入口**。\n\n这里面隐含着一个深层次的假设：**Web3应用的服务对象应该是“数字人”而非真人，每位现实世界中的用户可以选择在Web3中构建多个数字身份**。当然，每个人的时间精力总是有限的，因此这些数字身份总有主次、领域侧重之分，但这没有关系。如果用户要凭借一个成熟的数字身份做出违约、欺诈等行为，这意味着他可能会失去之前构建这个数字身份所做的一切努力。\n\nUnipass是这类项目的代表之一，它做的事情正是链上身份的聚合管理：通过一个Unipass ID，用户可以绑定邮箱、多个ETH地址，并且还搭建了社交图谱（CyberConnect）、信息聚合平台（RSS3）等应用层协议。通过这种不断的聚合和对应用层的整合、屏蔽，之后Unipass甚至可能成为用户在Web3入口，变成用户在Web3的“One Pass”。\n\n![Unipass APP主界面](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EMDIjmTqxg-pnPn5bUVkf.png?height=1952&width=3162)\n\n可以看出，Unipass是一个野心很大的项目，它的终极目标其实是取代钱包在当前Web3的生态位 —— 但其方案必然会与钱包项目起冲突，不少应用项目恐怕也不希望被“协议化”而失去流量入口。从更高的视角来看，对Web3的入口的竞争无疑是相当激烈的，未来Metamask等钱包项目很可能也会朝着链上身份聚合这个方向发展。\n\n> 关于Unipass的更多展望，可以参考Nervos Network对Unipass项目方的访谈：[A Conversation with UniPass: Your Free Web3 Account](https://medium.com/@nervosnetwork/a-conversation-with-unipass-your-free-web3-account-ce5ed52f73bc)\n\n另一类值得关注的项目以Spruce为代表。Spruce想做的事情简单来说，就是构建一个跨平台、跨公链的身份认证系统。比如，用户可以基于 SpruceID 的认证插件使用以太坊账户，直接登录 discord，不用二次信息验证。\n\n可以看出，Spruce的身份认证，更多体现在Web3公链地址与Web2各平台账号的互通与融合上。与Web2现有平台账号的绑定，对于一些已经在Web2中有一定成就和影响力的人而言，无疑是一个很不错身份增强方案 —— 例如一个几百万粉丝的Twitter大V，其去做借贷的时候很可能可以得到更优惠的抵押率和利率。\n\n![流程图： oidc.login.xyz 服务器如何帮助Spruce进行身份验证](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jMZLq-VoQChQYCsnri0OS.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nSpruce于2022年4月20日完成A轮3400万美元融资，由A16Z领投。由于Spruce的实现涉及到许多技术挑战，其应用目前尚未上线，不过项目方会在官方不时披露其开发进度。\n\n### 3.3 链上信用评分\n\n**这类项目的初心非常直接 —— 拓展Defi借贷的场景，把现实世界中金融行业的信用机制在Web3中找到某种实现，以提高Defi的资源配置效率**。\n\nARCx可以看做此类项目的一个代表。它于2022年5月13日完成新一轮融资，由 Dragonfly Capital、Scalar Capital 和 Ledger Prime 领投。\n\nARCx通过发行「DeFi Passport」，根据每个 DeFi Passport 持有者的信用分来量化其链上地址的信誉度。信用分将通过分析持有者的以太坊地址历史活动来确定，其范围设置为 0 到 999 分，该信用分确定了协议为用户提供的抵押率。对于信用分高的地址而言，DeFi Passport 能够提供有竞争力的借贷抵押。\n\n![ARCx官网截图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KrgqTjMZzL0ult0FkuoO9.png?height=1246&width=1360)\n\n可以看出，相比于前两类DID项目，链上信用评分类项目更聚焦于用户的“数字金融身份”，使用的也多是用户的链上交易数据而非其社交行为数据，这使得其很难朝完整的DID项目发展。但鉴于金融活动在Web3当前的重要地位，信用评分类项目也将会是完整DID生态中不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### 3.4 链上行为认证\n\n**如果说前三类项目都聚焦于对用户的身份状态作出静态的整理与评估，那么最后一类项目就显得比较特殊了 —— 它是对用户的身份状态作出动态的更新。这类项目的核心逻辑是，引导用户参与某些合作方要求的活动、行为，并对其颁发链上的认证**。\n\n**显然的，这类项目本身并没有给用户一个DID，更多的是对用户现有DID的不断补充。这类项目在DID的生态中也占有很重要的地位 —— 毕竟某种意义上，是它们定义了什么是“\n数字身份”的组成部分**。\n\nProject Galaxy是这个方向的明星项目，其代币于2022年5月4日在Binance上线。Project Galaxy也被称为“数据凭证网络”，这里的“凭证”，就是为行为认证的具体表达。\n\n> 用户连接钱包后即可生成一张“银河身份证”，证件上会根据地址的历史行为，自动贴上「认证证书」，比如「Uniswap 交易员」、「OpenSea 交易员」等等。这些凭证如同现实世界的各种职业资格证一般，在某些特定场景会发挥价值。\n\nProject Galaxy最大的应用场景，就是帮助项目方利用凭证数据来构建更好的产品和社区，成为连接项目方和用户的平台。比如项目方希望用户进行某种链上活动后才能获取空投资格，Project Galaxy就可以帮助项目方识别这种链上活动并颁发凭证，既方便项目方的空投管理，也赋予了用户更多的价值感。\n\n![项目方把活动任务挂在Project Galaxy上](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ldyd9CJ4ijpBRRENhgYxJ.png?height=1588&width=2658)\n\n另外一个值得介绍的项目是Rabbithole，它是“学习认证”类项目的代表。它希望游戏化思维，将每个去中心化应用分解为游戏任务，引导用户与区块链协议、去中心化应用进行交互，培育 DeFi 用户的使用习惯，同时用户的 Web3 操作和行为还将获得“认证”。从某种意义上，Rabbithole项目正在给未来的课程结业证书、甚至简历构建打下雏形。\n\n![Rabbithole的技能学习](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ofhd4KyscsoUFy0MaV-qg.png?height=1332&width=2320)\n\n## 4. 未来展望\n\n通过上述的分析，可以看出目前DID的发展依然处于早期探索阶段，有不少关键的问题仍然需要Web3建设者们去探索。对于这些问题，个人观点如下：\n\n**最关键的问题，是DID的产品形态之争**：DID会像Unipass那样，朝Web3的入口方向发展，与钱包赛道相融合？还是会作为承上启下的枢纽，提供对用户真人鉴定、信用评分等协议接口，服务于各种上层应用？还是还是短期内更偏向于和Web2各平台的融合，通过“与Web2共存”的方式来强化认证的可靠性和有效性？也许这三条道路会是相互交融的，甚至也许还可能有别的道路，这些目前都还没有答案。**个人倾向于认为它会发展成为Web3的入口 —— 毕竟在大众用户的心智中，总需要一个尽可能简单、全面的“入口”**。当前类似于Metamask的钱包在全面性上做的远远不够，而聚合类的DID或许是一个方案。Web1的门户网站、Web2的搜索引擎、移动互联网中微信使用时长的不断提升和小程序生态的繁荣，都印证了这一点。\n\n**其次重要的问题，是关于“数字人”与“真人”之争**：Web3应用的服务方到底应该是链下的真人，还是链下真人在数字世界中创建的镜像？后者似乎更加符合Web3的理念初心，但从Web3的全球监管合规化和大众普及角度考虑，真人的验证或许将是难以避免的。个**人认为，未来不排除这两者有共存的可能：经过真人认证的账号将在Web3世界中享有更多的权利，但纯粹的数字人依然也会被接受**。\n\n**另外衍生的问题，是关于隐私保护的问题**：随着各种认证、评分的增多，甚至是真人链下信息的绑定，总有一些信息用户是不希望暴露在链上、可被随时查看的。当然，用户也不会希望这些数据放在项目方的中心化数据库里，这样就失去Web3的意义了。如何保护用户的身份信息，仅让其在必要的时候披露给必要的对象，也是DID在技术实现中所要面临的问题。\n\n综上所述，DID赛道依然处于混沌的“莽荒时代”，这也将会是各路冒险家大展身手的舞台。\n\n## 5.投资建议\n\n虽然不少DID赛道的项目已经公开发行了代币，但多数项目的币价最高点往往出现在2021年11-12月的时候，现在的币价相比于最高点都有非常大的回落，有兴趣的读者可以去具体做些搜寻。\n\n为什么会出现这种情况？\n\n从情绪面上来看，21年底的时候正值新一轮牛市，随着Roblox的上市和Sandbox、Decentralized Land项目币价的飙升，“元宇宙”“Web3”相关概念异常火热，DID作为Web3的枢纽，也引来了社区情绪的FOMO。而在5月的现在，随着BTC、美股的层层下跌，再加上LUNA崩盘事件的阴影，社区的情绪是极度恐慌的，对于这类发展\n\n从项目基本面来看，DID本质上也属于偏基础设施的赛道。多数项目的代币难以构建很好的经济模型和应用场景，再加上其并不多的用户数、不高的增长速度，社区情绪过后引发币价下跌，也是一件可以理解的事情。\n\n从行业基本面来看，DID虽然确实是Web3发展的一大瓶颈所在，但它并不是唯一的瓶颈 —— 基础设施的不完善、用户上手成本的高昂等，都是老生常谈的其它问题。现在Web3在应用层可以说是“超金融化”的，除了Defi借贷、NFT交易等个别与用户交易行为直接关联的赛道之外，多数依然处于探索期，而DID的发展毕竟是需要真实应用场景做支撑的。在应用层如此现状之下，多数DID项目的用户数据不佳，也是可以理解的。\n\n因此，经过如上分析，**当下时点个人并不建议对DID项目采取短线投资的策略。毕竟短期内这些项目很难有高增长和大爆发，再加上整体市场依然在走熊，这些项目的币价很可能仍然存在下跌空间**。\n\n**但从长期来看，Web3若要实现真正的井喷式发展，必须要有成熟的DID解决方案，一定会有项目成为赛道龙头。所以，不妨用风险投资的思维，在自己看好的项目足够便宜的时候买入并长期持有，期待其将来成为赛道头部，实现数十倍乃至数百倍的回报**。\n\n###

{"id": "xGg8w6dzukFeQFK55cmcRbU48ugxCtx6loV9d9HSx9E", "title": "五年的爱情比不上一次网恋", "body": "         今天我第一次在天涯情感天地说自己的故事，也许也是最后一次，这是她介绍我来的这个地方，也是我为了她而离开的地方。我们是夫妻，我非常非常地爱她，有人问我我到底爱她有多深?我不知道，因为我无法回答，或者举一例子证明一下吧，或者这也根本不能说明什么，只是当时深陷情字里一些慕名其妙的举动罢了。我第一次见到她并爱上她时，两人在意乱情迷时，她告诉我她的第一次是因为不懂事给了初恋男友。我在她之前从未谈过恋爱，更没有碰过女孩子，听这事情无异于晴天霹雳，她看到我的神情马上就哭了，说她知道没有个人会接受她这样的女人，看着她流泪的样子我心都碎了，我过去抱住她向她发誓，在我心里她永远就最完美的。当天晚上她就委身于 我，当她躺在我胸口上时对我说，以后那怕我们吵得再厉害，也不要用这过错指责她，我许下了自己的诺言。一直到离婚，我在平时的争吵中从未违背过。\n\n        我们结婚了在婚后，因为我工作的性质决定了我在家里的时间比较多。她在一家事业单位上行政班，所以我承担了全部的家务，我是家中的独子，父母对我的要求从来是百依百顺，只要我提出的要求合理，他们全力的帮助我们。特别是在买房及建立我们这小家方面，可以说是无微不至，妈妈心疼我们，因为家里有亲戚在乡下，经常来走动，送些鸡鸭鱼米的土特产，她从不舍得吃，都托人送到了城里。以至于我们好几年不用采买这些东西，每天只需要买新鲜蔬菜就足够了。可是我总觉得她的心不在我的身上，因为她从未象别的女人关心自己老公一样关心过我。当看到朋友们身上穿的手里拿的 都老婆精心打理的东西时我不知道心里是什么滋味。\n\n         有一次我告诉她我们一个好朋友自从结婚以后，一回到家只需要看报纸就可以了，他老婆会把一切准备好。当时她哼一声。有这样不争气的女人!特别让我难以接受的是，当她的朋友来的家玩的时候，她只要坐在沙发上陪聊天，买菜做饭的事，当然包括洗碗的事也是我包 了。我的朋友不多，只有两个特别要好的朋友，可是每次他们两对夫妇来玩的时候，她只是淡淡打个招呼就进房上网聊天了。话也不多说几句，更别说什么亲自下厨做饭。我曾经暗地里说过她，她冷冷地回答我和他不认识，没话说!我曾经和她沟通过很多次，希望她在对我的朋友方面让我有点面子。她总是瞪大了眼睛，我又不求他们为什么要对他们好?说出来没人相信，她每天晚上洗澡时有一句话是必说的，你把我的内衣放那了?\n\n       有次我买菜路上碰到她，两人一起回来，路上她的同事问她青菜多少钱一斤?她吱吱唔唔答不出来。回到家后沉着脸好象是我故意给她难看一样。我承认自己个性懦弱，更主要原因是我非常怕她不开心，所以无原则地迁就她。原本以为这样会让她感动，可我错了，这样做的结果只增加了她对我的轻视。在单位装宽带了以后我们开始疯狂地上网，因只有一台所以经常为此争吵，于是又买 了一台，原本以为是解决争吵的一个好办法，谁知道却是一个悲剧的开端。有了电脑以后两人吃完饭就躲进小屋里上网，谁也不干涉谁。当时我申请了Q以后，如实填上了自己的婚姻状态，结果没一人肯加我的。我于是干脆改成未婚，这下好多了逐渐有人加我，我一直把网络和现实分得很开，不管聊得多好我不会告诉她们的真名实姓和真正的工作单位。更不会告诉她们家里电话。她一开始对我这样的做法的评价就两个字，虚伪!她有时会把的家里电话告诉别人，我很生气，于是她转到手机上去了。半夜三更经常收到短信，我很生气，她却若无其事，只是不当我的面发了，背地里发。自从上网后我们的夫妻生活出现了问题，我承认是个性欲很强的男人，当她从另外一个房间回来上床睡觉时，对我的表示总是很不情愿，不是说太晚就是说太累，我看到她呵欠连天，也就不想勉强她。所以有时我们夫妻生活一个月也没有一次。当我和我当医生的朋友说起时他们觉得天方夜谭，以我们这样的年纪(我31，她29)这种情形是绝对不可能的。\n\n        有一阵子她干脆说我晚上打鼾太大声，自己一个人到另一屋里去睡。一直到看到我非常生气以后悻悻的搬回来。我发现她变了许多，以往她对QQ上的亲热表情深恶痛绝，一有人发给她，马上拉到黑名单。可是到了后来她惭惭习惯了。对我越来越冷漠，她因为聊得开心，让给她买耳麦，我坚决反对，但是还是没拗过她违心给她买了。于是更加不可收拾。\n\n       每天回来家不问饭是否做了菜是否买了立马坐到电脑面前聊起来。而且在我有时外出的时候还把门反锁起来。我回来开了半天门她才慌张地来开，我质问她时，她不屑一顾，仿佛不值得说明原因一样。有一阵子她公休，马上搬到另一屋，一天到晚就只是上网上网，家里事一点没过问过。有时上网到凌晨四点多，我在另一屋醒来还能听到她的笑声。我开始起疑心，利用有朋友是电脑高手的便利条件，趁她不注意看了她的聊天纪录，可以说那是十颗原子弹在头上爆炸也没这样让我震惊，我看到了她和别人网做电话做的记录，那么恶心的话下流的字眼竟然出自她口中的手下!我记下那人的电话，我回家里给她打了个电话，刚刚开始她否认，但是看我说出了细节后，她不再说话，只强调不是真做!!!我很冷静地和她谈到离婚划分财产的事，当着她的面给那人打电话，让他带着户口本和身份证从内蒙过来，我告诉他如果他是真心的，我会好好她送她出门，立马帮他们结婚手续。要是他敢玩她，他小心他怕狗命!她无语，只是一副没做错的神情。我想我会努力坚强下去的。说了那么多，心里好受多了，在天涯里看多了网络上悲欢离合，从来没想到会在自己身发生。我只想告诉那些正沉迷在网络中的人们，悲剧往往在我们以为不可能的时候偷偷来临。到时再认为那些不可能在自己身发生的事情值得引起注意时，可能已经晚了。", "timestamp": 1653274672, "digest": "3dlMSgDDfg0Kv7QC7rchCMSOrtz0f4uDO3t7KU6sEfk", "contributor": "0xe2CDD6b2c8f18d2f8422e9994fb6494b76087f4E"}

{"id": "dGej4GeF9j0wuNiQw--hvRODF8ZscHo0lwTwHAl0mEE", "title": "爱情的隐形人", "body": "设置—黑名单—确认，这意味着，我的又一段网恋生活正式结束。\n\n这是多少次拉黑男生，我都不记得了。每一次，我们因为偶然的原因结识，每一次，都由我亲手将对方拉黑，无一例外。你们或许会鄙视我，说我无能，只配做虚拟世界里的好情人，现实却连一场真正的恋爱都没有谈过。我不介意嘲笑，但更害怕孤独。想到手机的那一头，此时有个人和我说说话，我会觉得无比温暖。是的，对方出于善意，单纯地喜欢和我聊天，对我无非分之想，只是我可耻地把他们都当作我的“备胎”，在心里构想和他们并不存在的未来，直到某一时间，知道自己不能再依赖对方下去，然后就随便发脾气，把对方拉黑，才能让自己冷静下来，不至于深陷。\n\n我也只是一个普通的女孩子，冷了累了就想谈一场恋爱，有个人给我呵护，我也去呵护那个人。就像世间所有普通的小情侣一样，我们习惯牵手，习惯拥抱，习惯彼此，习惯依赖。我需要更多的爱，而不是一个人独立完成所有，我没有想象的坚强，却只是勉强坚持下来。\n\n是什么时候养成这样的坏习惯呢?每个一两个月就寻找新的“备胎”，这样没有中心的生活令我心力交瘁。而且，不是谁都喜欢当备胎，有一次我不小心对一个男生把他当“备胎”的事实说漏嘴，从那以后，他对我的态度明显冷淡，再之后，彼此拉黑，再无往来。我觉得，的确是自己做错了，哪怕心里的确那样想，但是嘴上也不应该说出来。因为没有谁会喜欢当备胎，毕竟自己也曾经当过备胎……\n\n不是没有喜欢的人，而是喜欢不代表能在一起。现实生活里分分合合，人生也会有那么一两个遇见却永远无法企及的人。我抓住了一切机会，只是命运没有眷顾我。何尝不知道，一旦错过那个人，遇见下一个对的人就不知要多久了，我只是不想再等了，说什么“如果是你，晚点也没关系”的话简直是借口!第一次知道了什么叫痴心妄想，长夜漫漫辗转反侧的时候，这份不被爱的悲伤就会袭上心头，我除了一遍遍叫自己放弃，痛哭，还能做什么。放下?不放下?重要吗?只需要强迫自己，忘了吧，睡醒明天就会好的。\n\n我是爱情的隐形人，我追求它，却不会得到她，所以跟异性在网上聊天，不过也是想掩盖一件事，那就是我害怕黑夜，害怕寂寞。我给自己定的要求是这样，一段时间就跟一个异性朋友聊天，为的是不要分散注意力，全心全意只对一个人;而他们对我最好的回报就是，尽量做到每天晚上或者隔几天晚上就来找我。我用聊天逗他们开心，而他们付出的成本就只是时间而已。这是一场交易，可是很多时候我做的却是赔本生意，因为很容易就会把感情搭进去，然后生气，易怒，在道德与理智与情感之间纠结，最后结束关系。一开始我总是放任自己跟对方随便聊，不加限制，但是后来我发现，即使一开始我们对彼此都很满意，聊得非常开心，但是最终还是走到尽头，就几个月半年不到的时间。每次拉黑你以为我不心痛吗?会的，只是除了拉黑没别的办法。毕竟不是真正的网恋，如果排遣寂寞的目的达到了，我不介意再换另一个人，如此恶性循环。\n\n这大半年的时间里，尝试过和不同的异性聊天，但是他们都有一个共同特性，都是自己学校的男生，同校更有话题。在这些人里面，我会不断地“试探”，最终挑出一个能聊得下去的人，其余放弃。不是滥交，我的每一次选择都是有针对性的，这也得感谢我的运气，从今年2月到8月，只谈了四个比较好的异性朋友，一个学期就这样过来，拉黑了两个，还剩两个;然后，只跟一个“网友A”见了面。\n\n网友A算是四个人里面比较特别的一个，至少，我感激他陪我做了一场戏，尽管虚假，依然满足了我的心愿。准确说，我们的认识颇有“同是天涯沦落人”的意味，他那时刚好跟我一样失恋，然后我们就安慰起对方来。跟他虽然一波三折，最后不知怎么的还见了面，然后很有默契地，我们就走到了一起。私底下我们做着男女朋友做的事——吃饭、逛街、看电影、牵手……但在现实生活里我们谁也不肯承认彼此是认识的。我们就做了三天的爱情隐形人，没有告诉任何人。明知道他只是把我当排遣寂寞的玩物，备胎，我又何尝不是呢?可是，我害怕，明知道他不喜欢我，却还傻傻地喜欢上他，然后受伤。被拒绝都不悲伤，悲伤的是被玩弄了还反应不过来，叫我如何自处?我相信他不是那么坏的人，只是我人生中所有的第一次，不应该交给一份虚假的爱。我也跟普通的女孩子一样，对爱情充满憧憬，想跟自己喜欢的人做很多很多事，如果明知道我们只是假装情侣互相慰藉，这样的虚假，你能接受吗?\n\n说到底，我以为自己不一样，但终究还是败给自己受道德禁锢的思想，不能豁出去，奋不顾身，最后承受恶果。跟A在一起的时候，我的内心没有一刻不受谴责，备受煎熬，尤其看到那些光明正大秀恩爱的情侣时，我就会想，我跟A这种不伦不类不堪的关系到底算什么?!我真的很想很想要一个男朋友，很想很想，但是，也绝对不会是这样虚假的。我们之所以不公开，不仅是因为我们不是真正的情侣，还因为他从头到尾都在等他的真命天女出现，他必须让别人知道他还单身!我呢，一开始是无所谓的，可是后来，觉得跟他在一起也不错。试爱的结果是我同意了，他却退出了。所以，这也是我们后来吵翻的原因。我以为，好不容易有个“备胎”可以修成正果了，殊不知我又被玩了。幸好的是，我没有牺牲太大，更谈不上付出多少感情。从来就对那些存在网络另一端的“备胎”们不抱希望，我对它们仅有的要求也只是陪聊而已，不过分吧!然而，即使是我幸苦培养出的“备胎”有一天也惹我生气的话，那我就会认为，这只“备胎”对我已经没有任何价值了，因为我不需要惹我不开心的人呆在身边!\n\n这段时间，藏在心底里所有真实得令人恐惧的想法居然就这样被我一个字一个字地打出来，没错，我就是受刺激了，因为今天拉黑一个人!从昨晚开始，一直到现在，像是无缘无故地想起一些事，然后恼羞成怒，竭斯底里，一直淌眼泪，胸口难过得说不出话。并不是因为拉黑了那个男生，我只是痛惜自己苦心经营的一段人际关系又没了。微博删了，微信删了，我是真的想静静了!明知道这种生活是不能继续的了，明知自己是个极度渴望爱的人，却执意躲在键盘后寻找。网络没有约束力，想走的人随时可以走，真希望自己也能走，不要变成自己讨厌的人好吗?", "timestamp": 1653274782, "digest": "6Q6xNqwLpMr49jbVoO5wTNG2_pmNR4ss4f4XkIn5i_U", "contributor": "0xa4BB51ee447D5fFf441F059a5162935D1e040e05"}

Empower small-scale liquor brands and brewmasters through decentralization and technology on a global scale\n2. Tackle the monopolistic liquor Industry as a collective with partnerships with other distilleries, wineries, breweries,\n3. Tokenize and decentralize ownership of IRL Business properties\n\n![Digital Version of our DAO Distillery](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/o5v95Q2IWYmNuQmbcWmBX.png?height=1500&width=2667&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=large)\n\n## Why Put IRL Distillery Property on the Blockchain?\n\nBack in 2011, Vitalik Buterin made his first discovery of bitcoin in its early days and was drawn to the concept of a decentralized payment system, which he dismissed at first. Thus, he eventually connected with the idea after a second look years later.\n\nThe Web 3 movement with broader adoption of NFTs is very similar to bitcoin and the creation of Ethereum that steered new possibilities of the whole decentralized payment system and peer-to-peer economy with smart contracts.\n\nNow, we are at the tip of the iceberg of a whole new era with DAOs. They are eliminating third-party entities and a government that regulates how businesses can operate.\n\nDistilleries and Breweries at large are private businesses that a few individuals or groups can only access.\n\nThis phenomenon is more apparent when looking at luxury liquor brands. For example, buying 'Wine futures’ (buying ownership of wine before production) from prestigious wineries can be achieved with intimate connections with the winery or an insider.\n\n## Why Web3 — and why now?\n\n**✅ Cultural Significance**\n\n**Small-scale and independent distilleries are on the verge of extinction**. The cultural heritage of local breweries and distilleries is intimately tied to our society and core values. We want to utilize blockchain and bring it to the crypto-native community for empowerment.\n\n**✅ Ultimate NFTs are Real-Assets and Properties for DAOs**\n\n**Physical space to connect with like-minded people is essential for Web 3.0** and its future. We won’t stop there and\n\n**✅ Decentralized Future for Liquor Industry**\n\nBreweries and local liquor producers contribute largely to the economic activities of locals. We can empower them and **forever expand the boundary of what DAOs can achieve with community-owned IRL Liquor businesses.**\n\n### What’s happening Now:\n\n### Liquor Producers lack transparency, and these are some reasons why:\n\n\\[1\\] High Mark-up in prices of liquor products. \\[2\\] A substantial amount of profit goes into Marketing. \\[3\\] Centralized conglomerates own most of the brands we see and drink, monopolizing the entire market. \\[4\\] Create High Barriers to Entry for New Brands.\n\n### The High-End Wine/Spirits/liquor Industry is Centralized.\n\n\\[1\\] The top five spirits players are now estimated to account for about 48% of the global premium spirits market. \\[2\\] The top five Beer players make up 46% of the global branded beer market.\n\n## Our Vision:\n\n## “Alcohol beverage brand for the Web3 Community“\n\n## Our Execution:\n\n## “We will produce World’s First Craft Liquor entirely planned, designed, and produced from scratch by our DAO, utilizing our DAO Distillery facility.”\n\n![https://www.thetokendispatch.com/a-definitive-guide-to-daos/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c11Gy4qGQ-ZnsgLCBtRaw.png?height=900&width=1600&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n### Tokenization of Liquor Producing Properties through the Blockchain has several benefits:\n\n1.

Your chance to make this project a reality.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Why put Distillery Property on the Ethereum blockchain?\n\nThere are several reasons:\n\n* Build and manage IRL properties with DAO Governance\n* Maximize collective benefit by utilizing Blockchain-powered transparency\n* Connect real-world assets to the digital world.\n* Have a talk over a drink with like-minded Web 3 folks. Cheers.\n\n**So, Where’s the Distillery? and is it already owned?**\n\n`The DAO Distillery property is currently located in South Korea and is already owned by our founding team`. We wish to fill in with the ideas of our DAO. A 3-story factory building with 2364 meter square space legally authorized to produce liquors and spirits. Commercial space is also available so we can start the construction of the **DAO Lounge** for our Holders.\n\n**What will the distillery property produce?**\n\nNot decided yet; it will be voted by YOU and our DAO with realistic measures. We will be creating much more than liquors and spirits.\n\n**How can the DAO members contribute?**\n\nIn the upcoming phases of development, we will form **Guilds** with different roles to open-up access to active participation and bounties.\n\nMembers can also contribute by adding their ideas to our upcoming WhitePaper. There will be much room for contribution in the sectors of **legal**, **dev**, **community/marketing,** and **operational** procedures.\n\n**What do you see as the future of ChainSpirit DAO?**\n\nWe wish that ChainSpirit DAO is able to buy and govern distilleries, wineries, and more all over Asia, Europe, and the United States and put world-class liquor producing businesses on chain.\n\n## How to Get Involved!\n\nJoin our official [Discord](https://discord.gg/SUNa6dPWdq) channel!

{"id": "YMIZWQn6rBK2eYqFy7RB8eJLdnHxeOanlveogSKD7NE", "title": "千倍合约小教程", "body": "在开始之前，要提醒几个事：\n\n第一最好不要玩合约。除非你知道自己在做什么，但因为在币圈几乎大多数人最后都会去了解合约，那我建议你除非学习并实践过一年以上，否则，最多用300U和5X以下，以学习的心态，否则，相信我，结果一定是亏损。\n\n第二合约赚不了大钱。大钱要靠大趋势的现货，我们一起等熊市，我会告诉大家买什么。\n\n第三控制仓位最重要。要开合约，我也只建议5X以下，而且尽量大趋势下开，比如LUNA这种大崩，小钱玩一玩，实际上大仓位的人，0.5X都有爆仓几千万的人。但是倍数也和你的仓位相关，比如10U开50X，在全仓模式下等于100U开5X（逐仓的话永远只能5X以下），所以几乎只建议一个人永远只开一个固定倍数，比如交易大神静海飞鱼，永远是50X，但仓位占总仓位比例小。\n\n第四逐仓最多5X。如果是满仓，那么，最多开5X，10X已经是赌博了，至于20X、100X，那不存在的，因为没有好的止损工具存在，没有意义。\n\n**下面再开始讲教程（注意：如果看不懂，不要操作）**\n\n首先，问一个问题：30U本金，开千倍合约，理论上相当于仓位300U开*100倍，这不是和3000U*10倍，30000U 1倍一样，而且开出来就爆仓？为什么要千倍呢？\n\n说是一千倍，其实如前所说，10X都是高风险，那么，肯定要通过诀窍来享受到1000倍的福利，但最好只承担10X以下的风险？诀窍就是**借钱生钱，亏借的，不亏本金。**\n\n具体操作：\n\n30U的仓位，起手开一个0.03U，其实只相当于30U开10X，所以并不存在开单就爆仓，如果方向开对了，这个0.03U会迅速产生利润，如产生了200U利润，现在关键来了。\n\n设置一个保本的止损——把30U本金转走，你现在有利润200U有一个千倍的单子——在单边行情中，用利润可以在合适的时候慢慢加仓，这个时机和加仓大小很讲究，如果加早了、加大了，白忙一场，加小了，感觉浪费了机会。\n\n简单来说，就是总仓位放一点点小钱，但由于这一点点小钱通过起手开非常小的但是杠杆非常高的单子，于是亏损就是30U，盈利是按千倍走，而且和低杠杆不同的是，行情轻微波动，利润都变化很大，于是很容易用利润加仓，如果方向正确，而且加仓谨慎，很容易获得一个不错的回报——而风险就在于一开始方向错了，类似30U开10倍，爆了也无所谓，亏损就是这30U，但利润的话……\n\n这样，手续费之类都不在乎了，而且如果盈利了，及时锁定本金，确保不亏。利润如果增长了，用利润滚仓，碰到单边行情就不得了。\n\n我就是在比特币突破2万时，开了2U的千倍，后来用利润加仓到46U的本金，最后多的时候赚了近4万U，交易所把所有人盈利的单子强平了，钱发给大家，产品下架……当时群里很多人都是非常大的利润。一气之下，当即就让所有人从交易所提币走人了， 还好走了，现在A网已经登录不上了，所以推荐大家在币安\\\\OKX\\\\FTX三大所之外的交易所都不要放太多钱了。\n\n总结关键词就是：**极小仓位**，比如30U本金（我个人是300U，开0.3U起步）；**利润锁定**，只要赚了，就及时通过止损工具，确保不会被爆仓之类，把本金先转走。\n\n目前只有HOO有千倍，省手续费注册链接如下，HOO是个老牌交易所，不过我也是千倍才用它：\n\nhttps://www.hoo.tc/invite/26748434", "timestamp": 1653275599, "digest": "5olx9by6BhJLdDoM0dDOzPa3EjQdyOhRvNyO0s_kIgA", "contributor": "0x7A470d8014a122245b0410774618B7ED0E990Daa"}

{"id": "z-shiMx7W4St50EMZtZbp3BpFE5v0EMgs3SJCuoImoE", "title": "千倍合约小教程", "body": "在开始之前，要提醒几个事：\n\n第一最好不要玩合约。除非你知道自己在做什么，但因为在币圈几乎大多数人最后都会去了解合约，那我建议你除非学习并实践过一年以上，否则，最多用300U和5X以下，以学习的心态，否则，相信我，结果一定是亏损。\n\n第二合约赚不了大钱。大钱要靠大趋势的现货，我们一起等熊市，我会告诉大家买什么。\n\n第三控制仓位最重要。要开合约，我也只建议5X以下，而且尽量大趋势下开，比如LUNA这种大崩，小钱玩一玩，实际上大仓位的人，0.5X都有爆仓几千万的人。但是倍数也和你的仓位相关，比如10U开50X，在全仓模式下等于100U开5X（逐仓的话永远只能5X以下），所以几乎只建议一个人永远只开一个固定倍数，比如交易大神静海飞鱼，永远是50X，但仓位占总仓位比例小。\n\n第四逐仓最多5X。如果是满仓，那么，最多开5X，10X已经是赌博了，至于20X、100X，那不存在的，因为没有好的止损工具存在，没有意义。\n\n**下面再开始讲教程（注意：如果看不懂，不要操作）**\n\n首先，问一个问题：30U本金，开千倍合约，理论上相当于仓位300U开*100倍，这不是和3000U*10倍，30000U 1倍一样，而且开出来就爆仓？为什么要千倍呢？\n\n说是一千倍，其实如前所说，10X都是高风险，那么，肯定要通过诀窍来享受到1000倍的福利，但最好只承担10X以下的风险？诀窍就是**借钱生钱，亏借的，不亏本金。**\n\n具体操作：\n\n30U的仓位，起手开一个0.03U，其实只相当于30U开10X，所以并不存在开单就爆仓，如果方向开对了，这个0.03U会迅速产生利润，如产生了200U利润，现在关键来了。\n\n设置一个保本的止损——把30U本金转走，你现在有利润200U有一个千倍的单子——在单边行情中，用利润可以在合适的时候慢慢加仓，这个时机和加仓大小很讲究，如果加早了、加大了，白忙一场，加小了，感觉浪费了机会。\n\n简单来说，就是总仓位放一点点小钱，但由于这一点点小钱通过起手开非常小的但是杠杆非常高的单子，于是亏损就是30U，盈利是按千倍走，而且和低杠杆不同的是，行情轻微波动，利润都变化很大，于是很容易用利润加仓，如果方向正确，而且加仓谨慎，很容易获得一个不错的回报——而风险就在于一开始方向错了，类似30U开10倍，爆了也无所谓，亏损就是这30U，但利润的话……\n\n这样，手续费之类都不在乎了，而且如果盈利了，及时锁定本金，确保不亏。利润如果增长了，用利润滚仓，碰到单边行情就不得了。\n\n我就是在比特币突破2万时，开了2U的千倍，后来用利润加仓到46U的本金，最后多的时候赚了近4万U，交易所把所有人盈利的单子强平了，钱发给大家，产品下架……当时群里很多人都是非常大的利润。一气之下，当即就让所有人从交易所提币走人了， 还好走了，现在A网已经登录不上了，所以推荐大家在币安\\\\OKX\\\\FTX三大所之外的交易所都不要放太多钱了。\n\n总结关键词就是：**极小仓位**，比如30U本金（我个人是300U，开0.3U起步）；**利润锁定**，只要赚了，就及时通过止损工具，确保不会被爆仓之类，把本金先转走。\n\n目前只有HOO有千倍，省手续费注册链接如下，HOO是个老牌交易所，不过我也是千倍才用它：\n\nhttps://www.hoo.tc/invite/26748434", "timestamp": 1653275690, "digest": "5olx9by6BhJLdDoM0dDOzPa3EjQdyOhRvNyO0s_kIgA", "contributor": "0x7A470d8014a122245b0410774618B7ED0E990Daa"}

The platform is deployed on the Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon and Arbitrum blockchains and has about $58 million in total value locked ([TVL](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/why-tvl-matters-in-defi-total-value-locked-explained/)), according to [DefiLlama data](https://defillama.com/protocol/izumi-finance).\n\nAlong with the funding, iZUMi announced its new iZiSwap decentralized exchange (DEX), which employs a novel automated market maker (AMM) protocol and the iUSD token.\n\n\"Liquidity is the catalyst for growth in DeFi. With the launch of our Discretized-Liquidity AMM and iUSD, iZUMi Finance is eliminating the barriers to liquidity and making DeFi more attractive and efficient for market participants,\" iZUMi co-founder Jimmy Yin said in a press release.\n\n## Funding\n\nThe iUSD token is 1:1 pegged to the U.S. dollar, akin to a stablecoin, and it's backed by iZUMi’s collateral and future revenue. IZUMi issues and sells iUSD to private investors.\n\nThe new funding included $20 million from institutional investors Ivy Ventures, Cobo and Mirana, among others. More than half of that total came from a voucher sale on the bond-focused Solv Protocol. iZUMi also sold $4 million BUSD worth of the vouchers and an additional 5,000 in BNB, which is equivalent to about $2 million.\n\n## Decentralized exchange\n\nThe new iZiSwap exchange is built around a so-called \"discretized-liquidity\" AMM. An AMM is simply the protocol that powers a DEX. The discretized liquidity part is more complicated.\n\nThe DLAMM model optimizes the price ranges and amount of liquidity for the providers. The end result is a lack of slippage, or difference between the expected price and the executed price in a transaction.\n\n“Let’s say you go to a bank and transfer your USD into GBP. You can’t always get the exact amount of equivalent GBP because there’s transaction fees from the bank and fluctuating exchange rates,” Yin told CoinDesk over Telegram. “DeFi solves the transaction fee part by lowering it significantly compared to banks, and we take good care of the part where the exchange rate will be as favorable to you as possible.”", "timestamp": 1653275958, "digest": "UsEM7OSLsyLkIBeJnoHV66FTUo90uniBm0y9GFkCQtE", "contributor": "0xd23e5a77AC2AdBDdaA1569389581732f2EA09E61"}

已经提前生成并记录在了合约里。每当一个 Ghost 的图片公开了以后，任何人都可以验证图片的完整性和图片的位置（也就是 Token ID）。\n\n所以，我这会儿说的稀有款，它的编号 #205 和它的图片内容，都是提前已经确定好的。而“提前确定好的图片内容和位置“这两个事实，任何人都可以在图片公开以后验证。\n\n同理，未来开图以后，看到的每一张图，它的顺序和内容也已经提前确定，并且可以被验证，这样以确保未来开图过程的公平。\n\n### 那比如说，如何验证上面这张图？\n\n现在这个 HippyGhosts #205 提前开图，我需要验证，这个图不是我现在临时决定的，并且这个图，我在 mint 之前，已经把它排在了 9999 个图中的第 205 位。\n\n首先，在新窗口打开这个图片，浏览器中可以看到这个图片的 base64 编码，这就是图片的数据，对这个数据进行 `keccak256` 哈希后，得到\n\n`0bf413340f0db024d3621259bc4140f9defad64ac78725d90f569a131be561f4`\n\n然后在 HippyGhosts 的 MerkleTree 中寻找这一串哈希，位置为第 205 个叶子结点\n\n`https://api.hippyghosts.io/~/storage/merkletree`\n\n因为这个 MerkleTree 是在 HippyGhosts 自己的服务器上的，接下来就是确认它的数据是否可信，首先从 MerkleTree 的第一行获得 MerkleRoot\n\n`58d247a687ef48f010e2e6107a04d575787163cfb0d70543c421a5001e9f5aab`\n\n同时这个 MerkleRoot 数据也存在于 HippyGhosts 的 Renderer 合约源代码中\n\n`https://etherscan.io/address/0x856bd414d7c4718f844795b30510af2f5fee2ee1#code#F9#L10`\n\n这里要提起一个叫做隔离见证的东西，意思就是：就是一个结果的出现，需要依赖于一个事实的发生。在这个例子中，**结果**就是 MerkleRoot，**事实**就是所有图片的内容和顺序。\n\n`58d247a687ef48f010e2e6107a04d575787163cfb0d70543c421a5001e9f5aab`\n\n现在我们在合约代码中发现了**结果**（即MerkleRoot），这个结果是在合约部署的时候就出现了，自然就是在 mint 之前，那么，所有图片的内容和顺序这个**事实**也一定发生在合约部署之前。这是因为根据 MerkleTree 的特点，如果图片的内容和顺序不同，MerkleRoot 也会变化，那么对于一个确定的 MerkleRoot，就一定有确定的图片内容和顺序。\n\n讲完了，当然这不是公平开图的最有思路，只是我自己比较喜欢用 MerkleTree 来处理它。如果在公平开图这个事情上有其他想法，欢迎交流。\n\n🔗 <https://muselink.cc/web3nomad>", "timestamp": 1653276436, "digest": "dt6V7LiKCRjrJD2dBlucd0JFm8jwkjxN3Ictb8osS5g", "contributor":

Tower defense simulator is a free game on ipad or any mobile devices.The game is a game of strategy.So you start off on the home page where you could either go to see what towers you have,(You only have 4 starters,spike,dart ,ninja ,and tack monkeys.)You could buy monkeys with either tacks or monkey bananas,which you get on the game for each round you play.Then there are four choices.You can go to either practice,battle or impoppable mode.if you go to battle then you have to choose one of the battles.But you need medals to go in 1.The first option requires 5 medals.When you go in it randomines a player to play with you then you are going to have the 5 medals going from you to a trophy.The other player does the same.Then there will be ten medals in the trophy.Then you have a randomized map.When it turns into something you don't like,you can skip the map.If the other player likes the map and you skip it ,It will still turn to a different map.You both only have one skip ,so use it wisely.After that You will have seen all the monkeys you have on the left side and you can choose which 3 to put in.The last one is a randomized tower.you use energy which you gain over time,to spin and it give you a new tower.You can do this infinitely unless the time is on.Then when you both press ready the game starts.I will leave that for next review ,so we are going to skip to practice mode.Practice mode is when you go against and ai so the other side is blocked up.You can choose your map and your towers.But at the randomized tower place,it will only cost zero energy.Like its name you don’t lose anything since it is a practicing game.But you can lose since you only have a 100 healthI am going to stop here for today's report adios.\n\n正好386字！quote by Andrew 40000iq\n\ni used google translate", "timestamp": 1653277367, "digest": "Gk7I_IQYGW2M6AiuMkddHc-Z1lrsNtucqQo9P8uQtV4", "contributor": "0xCA7cA0040B6171aCaEf2Ce13422BaB63c31DFD72"}

{"id": "pg1wjOPwTPVPqW8v1kJfTEeHz2ZTTz0Cme0jzv-felQ", "title": "为什么收藏NFT艺术品？", "body": "### 什么是NFT艺术品？\n\n头像类NFT的造富效果让NFT这词很快出圈。通过各类社交账号把头像设置为购入的无聊猿或者Doodles等形象，不仅可以证明自己对某种文化的认可，也可以低调炫耀自己的财富。作为信息时代的时尚弄潮儿，通过头像展示法拉利钥匙的年代早已过去，而NFT头像则是一种证明自己跟上时代步伐的新潮流。不置可否，头像类的NFT也是艺术的一种表现形式，但是该类NFT的最终价值取决于品牌IP，亦或是背后的游戏生态或是web3赋能等，购买头像类NFT更像是对一家初创企业的投资，而不是对艺术收藏的投资。本文想简单聊一聊纯艺术类的NFT收藏，以及为什么要现在开始收藏NFT艺术品。\n\n![Chimera by Mpkoz](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zzpYyBrWCMpNl1t7u0T69.jpg?height=1869&width=1125)\n\nTwitter上一位藏家Artifaction给出了很好的解释，他的想法总结如下：\n\n> *文艺复兴、印象派、超现实主义、波普艺术.. 这些主义或者派系的诞生都早于我们出生的年代，我们已经不可能在法国街头买到那副印象派作品，或者在Andy Warhol刚有起色的时候成为他的藏家。这些时代都已经过去，而最新的艺术潮流（或者说某种艺术运动）正在我们眼前发生。艺术家们正在用新的技术媒介把作品铸造在区块链上。*\n>\n> *从投资角度来看，收藏NFT可以让家族的世世代代享受这些杰作。现在由各大拍卖行出售的艺术品大部分都由富有的个人和机构收藏着，昂贵的价格绝不是普通人能够拥有的。而对于最新的艺术趋势，我们掌握着收藏的主动权。我们有各种工具帮我们了解艺术家，有平台可以展示我们的藏品。收藏NFT艺术品是大势所趋，未来已来。*\n\n![Cosmic Reef by Leo Villareal - 在Artblocks Curated发布的这个系列非常特别且精美，很适合自己一个人晚上看着自嗨。](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ob50KWgHd8BFyDUNx-xtl.JPG?height=628&width=638)\n\n### 收藏NFT艺术品的好处？\n\nNFT艺术品是互联网和信息时代的产物，区块链的可追溯性、透明性、跨国界实时交易的便捷性以及（某种程度的）不可篡改让很多新媒体类艺术作品（比如摄影、视频、代码生成艺术、音乐、AR等）展现出其独有的价值。除此以外，收藏NFT的门槛往往比传统艺术收藏低很多。以下简单列出收藏NFT艺术品的优势。\n\n![Lil Heroes by Egar Plans](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_YWDeP9ORKZ8F77WeuBly.jpg?height=996&width=995)\n\n### 1. 价格亲民\n\n新兴艺术载体作为一种小众的存在，往往有着价格优势。无论是在艺术圈赫赫有名的蓝筹艺术家、或是加密艺术的新起之秀，如果能在他们发布NFT的早期收集他们的作品，在购买的价格上具有非常大的新引力，这些艺术品的发行价格往往在3000美金以下。比如Damien Hirst发售的Currency，发售价为2000美金；蔡国强老师的炸自己NFT，发售价为999美金；方力钧老师的Elemental，发售价大约为600美金；Leo villareal的Cosmic Reef, 发售价为1800美金； Edgar Plans的Lil’heroes,发售价大约为1500美金。作为行业早期红利，很多蓝筹艺术家在新兴领域会制定一个比较亲民的价格试水，所以如果能以发行价买到蓝筹艺术家的作品，会是一个比较稳妥的收藏和投资选择。\n\n![L'Informe I by Rachel Rose 这件作品的细节非常夸张，整个文件尺寸超过了100MB。在局部进行放大后仿佛看到了另外一副截然不同的作品，Rachel的创作非常用心。](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bnVhyEEH7mYSYWXaODjyQ.jpg?height=1007&width=763)\n\n### 2. 发售机制相对透明\n\n互联网的便捷性打破了传统艺术收藏的隔阂，让藏家可以清楚的了解到发售价格和发售机制。在传统艺术收藏中，普通藏家往往无法在一级市场购买到热门艺术家的作品。毕竟如果买到即赚到，为何让非VIP享受这种福利呢？当然，不置可否的是，相对exclusive的制度可以防止一些炒家进行短期套利的行为，但是对于一些刚开始收藏的藏家来说，二级市场的交易价格往往会昂贵很多。这些在传统艺术圈里的不透明性，在NFT艺术收藏中有一定的改善。NFT艺术品往往有比较清晰的发售规则，发售形式可能以抽奖，亦或者通过购买艺术家原有作品获取新作品的购买权。\n\n![Elemental by Fang Lijun](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LeRfqWrFqZKgHd073ZiWG.jpg?height=997&width=990)\n\n### 3. 保存、运输和防伪\n\n数据作为NFT艺术品的载体解决了艺术实体的收藏以及运输问题，你不需要调整室内合适的湿度，安装防盗系统，亦或是为艺术品的运输支付保险、税费等，也无需在出售的时候提供第三方鉴定机构的防伪证明。交易简单便利，只需要在交易所一键挂单，全世界的藏家都能通过交易平台查看并选择购买NFT艺术品。我觉得百达翡丽的广告词也可以很好的适用于NFT艺术品：没人能真正拥有NFT艺术品，你只是在替下一代保管它。手表或者实体艺术品容易丢失，损坏，而链上数据的拥有权掌握在私钥持有者手中。\n\n![Exploding the Self by Cai Guoqiang （视频截图）- 视频展示了火药创作的整个过程以及最后的成品，是蔡老师为自己创作的艺术家自画像。](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dWNEsmlJ3Jw04UGMU6OsQ.JPG?height=357&width=637)\n\n### 4. 相对便捷的展示与交易\n\n相交传统艺术品，NFT的流动性会好很多。对于传统艺术品，藏家往往需要通过画廊或者拍卖行出售自己的作品，不仅需要支付昂贵的服务费，而且耗时耗力。NFT艺术品的转售相对简单，可以在各大交易平台挂单后，通过Twitter或者Discord等沟通媒介，向其他潜在藏家通知和展示待出售的藏品。除此之外，也可以通过自己建立在线画廊，展示自己的收藏，提高关注度。需要提醒的是，艺术品始终是一个流动性比较低的投资标的，因此在购买艺术品的时候，选择自己喜欢的收藏更重要。\n\n### 收藏101\n\n如何进行收藏？我觉得简单来说就是选艺术家和选发行平台。\n\n对艺术家DYOR：DYOR意为自己做研究。互联网的透明性以及技术的便利性让我们可以很方便的对艺术家做详细的研究和了解，你可以非常便捷的浏览艺术家的主页、Instagram、twitter来判断他的作品是否符合你的审美。也可以快速的查询Superrare，Opensea等交易平台的交易记录来判断作品的保值/增值程度。甚至，你可以直接通过社交平台与他们直接联系或者进行日常互动，了解他们创作过程中的想法。关注一些大藏家和收藏机构也能让你收获到不少信息，并了解整个市场情况。藏家推荐：@artifaction2, @cozomoMedici, @curatedxyz （也欢迎关注我@weishi66199181）\n\n选择优秀的发行平台：普通人往往很难发掘蓝筹艺术家，专业的事情可以让专业的人来完成，因此跟踪好的艺术发行平台就非常的重要，并且可以帮助你省下很多时间和经历。在现实收藏中，我们都知道Pace、贝浩登等画廊扶持了很多优秀的艺术家，在web3世界，选择好的发行平台并在一级市场购入作品也是非常稳妥的投资方法。我推荐关注的平台有：Artblocks, Heni, ASH（PAK生态），TR Lab，Outland以及ZHEN，小众一点的平台有Feral File, BrainDrops, Async Art。也可以时刻关注苏富比、佳士得以及Pace画廊，他们也可能会推出NFT作品。\n\n以后有机会可以详细的写一个收藏的thought process。\n\n![Fragements by James Jean - James Jean](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hN53W2wCgT33SSwuK5AZu.JPG?height=638&width=638)\n\n### NFT作品和艺术家推荐（不定期更新）\n\n近期比较看好的艺术家：\n\n未透露的过世蓝筹艺术家（通过TRLAB平台发售）\n\nIan Cheng （通过Outland平台发售）\n\nTigerbob NFT\n\nPixel Blossom\n\n![Qu4ntum by Ness Graphic](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6UpEe3Q08WxnLbjz-i2j1.JPG?height=639&width=634)\n\n### 有潜力的领域\n\nAR+区块链+艺术会是个很有趣的领域，很期待Zhen能在这个领域做出些什么创新。We are still early.\n\n![Robot Shark by Hajime Sorayama - NFT持有人也是创作者，AR的艺术形式让艺术家和藏家共同创作（本图属于乱拍）。](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Pa6Ilrdvpf19TQ-dVGlVJ.jpg?height=579&width=1125)\n\n文中所有收藏，可以通过我创建的画廊进行欣赏：\n\n[https://deca.art/shanghairen/billion-dollar-collection](https://deca.art/shanghairen/billion-dollar-collection)\n\n下一篇会简单聊一聊音乐类NFT，以及我看好的音乐类NFT平台。", "timestamp": 1653277361, "digest": "J883tYQtMss4LZwlBy1dpRGLjav47CEfip1XJ8s5b9I", "contributor": "0x359B7628F98F3B73e9BdCb2D8476932342fC5aeA"}

{"id": "6CrFi5Cd8rSvS-brWM9BxbJiytepx0BpCzjTtVAguzQ", "title": "Aster Protocol 投研", "body": "**项目介绍**\n\nAster Protocol 创造了网络世界中第一个链上身份聚合协议。并提供去中心化的商业基础设施（用于在线和离线世界的商品和服务）以加速所有权经济（“创造者经济”）。受到 Loot、ENS、1inch 等先驱者的启发，该平台提供了一个多链 Web3 协议集合，赋予传统社交媒体平台 Web3 与区块链的功能，将当前所有的 Web2 社交平台与 Web3 应用进行无缝连接。使用 NFT、DeFi、SocialFi、DAO 以及元宇宙的相关应用，为区块链行业带来更多使用场景。Aster 通过 Web2.0 互联网的并行网络，以 OpenMeta 基础设施将人们引导到 Web3.0 时代。致力于解决社交、商业和营销方面的问题。\n\nStar 专注于提供以下产品和解决方案：\n\n·        社交服务、Aster 名称服务、Aster DID、混合社交图、社交时刻和社交资产管理\n\n·        Web2社交平台的营销服务、链上空投、抽奖、协作活动\n\n·        商务服务，\n\n·        NFT 商店构建器（Web3 中的 Shopify）\n\n·        实物资产通证化\n\nStar 是一个多链平台，支持以太坊、BNB、Avalanche、Polygon 等。基于路线图，开发团队计划未来打造社交区块链。考虑到链上社交需求，高性能的公链是必不可少的，Star 团队将使用 Avalanche 子网等技术栈。该社交区块链将促进以下功能的开发：\n\n1\\.社交功能，包括赠送NFT和小费\n\n2\\.奖励计划，如优惠券、彩票等\n\n3\\.粉丝俱乐部服务\n\n4\\.版税计划\n\n5\\.企业级实物资产代币化、保管、兑换、未来on-chain Ecommerce的物流服务\n\n在多链的支持下，它将促进Aster DID被商业和内容行业合作伙伴广泛使用，目标是10万亿美元的市场。同时，Star 会将 Web2 用户迁移到 Web3，将 10 亿用户带入 Web3 生态系统。目前，Star 正在与 club-metaverse 平台合作，支持 DJ 在社交平台上发布 EDM 的 NFT，例如在社交网络上拥有数百万粉丝的 Dannic、Thomas Gold、Vini Vici。除了音乐产业，Star 还支持 Skyfall Inc 推广日本动画作品的 NFT。Skyfall由著名动画制作人上田益夫先生创立，他是Aniplex的前总裁兼执行董事，以创作高达、钢之炼金术士、犬夜叉、妖精的尾巴、Fate Grand等100多部动画系列和电影而闻名订单、刀剑神域在线等。凭借创新的设计，Star 致力于在从 Web2 到 Web3 时代的过渡中发挥主导作用，并推动 Web3 中代币化的大规模采用。\n\n演示demo（在推特上将NFT送给其他用户）：<https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1bS4y1a7s8>\n\n另一个技术方面是：Aster Name Service（星辰域名服务），连接web2和web3的社交身份聚合器。\n\n根据演示，用户可以通过浏览器扩展aster将NFT传递到任何社交网络上。\n\n**当前用例**\n\n1\\.与skyfall合作：该公司有意将IP制作成NFT，aster协助skyfallmint自己的NFT，建立NFT商店，并且助其NFT在社交媒体上传播。\n\n2\\.与DiscoverFeed合作：DiscoverFeed的EDM NFT目前面临着问题：缺乏将其NFT公开在社交媒体上以进一步吸引粉丝的工具。Aster给出的解决方案是通过ANS系统直接触达该DJ在twitter、Instagram、Facebook等社交网站上的大量粉丝。\n\n3\\.与三井不动产的合作：数字艺术的展示\n\n4\\.与BetaMars的合作：目前BetaMars仍然是通过收集用户钱包地址的市场活动来收集目标用户，缺乏web2到web3的桥梁，aster可以通过自己的市场工具（例如通过空投、抽奖的方式）触达游戏爱好者。\n\n**联合创始人**\n\n*Michael Huang*（中国人）：推特：@michael_web3，领英：<https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-huang-651754233/>（没有相关信息）。\n\nErvin Zhuang（中国人）：推特：@ Ervin_Zhuang，本科上海外国语日语专业，2014年就读中欧国际工商学院（应该算是亚洲地区最好的MBA），曾就职：2020年2月-2021年3月：Laox Co Ltd（日本，跨境贸易、商贸服务）的战略发展部副主任，2018-2019年ACG network（日本-新加坡，加密货币领域，结合了数字内容和区块链技术的平台，主要是动漫游戏）的CFO，以及国内的投资机构（2017-2019年：ChenYao Capital 晨曦资本，2014-2017年：Purestone Capital Group 璞石资本集团）。\n\n**融资情况**\n\n种子轮融资：100万美元，由 Youbi Capital、Pluto Capital、Lancer Capital、Lucid Blue Ventures 等机构参投，投资者还包括：Republic亚洲合伙人Zhen Cao，FBG合伙人区块链行业连续创业者Hitters Xu，OP Crypto COO Lucas He，以及其他多位知名风投机构创始人。\n\n**社交媒体关注度**\n\n推特关注人数：6774（2022-5-22）\n\n**动态**\n\n5月刚参加了币安冠名的的DoraHacks的黑客松（亚洲地区）。\n\n目前aster protocol正在DoraHacks上参加BNB捐赠，投票网址：<https://dorahacks.io/zh/buidl/2522>\n\n**总结**\n\n项目仍处于较早期，目前还未发币，其目标在于构建web2.0用户便于进入web3.0的桥梁，目前主要专注于NFT的应用场景。个人认为web2.0到web3.0一定会有一个循序渐进的过程，这个过程除了技术和监管等因素外，还需要用户的知识和意识提高，类似aster protocol这种建立在现有的web2.0社交网络上面的web3.0应用会是当下比较容易和合适的选择，降低了传统web2.0用户进入web3.0的门槛。\n\n项目优点：项目选择的方向，前景比较好；项目落地比较好，目前已经有许多用例；创始人有传统web2.0的商业经验和投资机构人脉。\n\n项目缺点：目前属于较为早期的阶段，热度不高，团队没有特别厉害的人物。并且网站、社群都没有建立的很好。护城河较浅，未来不排除会有强大竞争对手出现，竞争对手除了web3.0公司外还可能有传统web2.0的公司；该项目不仅需要web3.0的经验，更需要web2.0的经验，比如用户画像，算法推荐等等，所以有可能传统web2.0的公司竞争力更强。目前也没有相关的代币经济模型。\n\n总之，很早期的项目，赛道不错，可以持续关注，尤其是后续上线可以亲自使用下，看看使用体验如何。", "timestamp": 1653277830, "digest": "6xDUp0lz3GK1Oem6P9i4Rdz6DKMK71l1Zd_b_0BTIcA", "contributor": "0x7591dDC0cEc44843CecD94b01A94357cB339E458"}

{"id": "NyzK4lqCLtHx6-oskLUI8Vo3RUmZkbs8CFECxeK2bWY", "title": "为什么收藏NFT艺术品？", "body": "### 什么是NFT艺术品？\n\n头像类NFT的造富效果让NFT这词很快出圈。通过各类社交账号把头像设置为购入的无聊猿或者Doodles等形象，不仅可以证明自己对某种文化的认可，也可以低调炫耀自己的财富。作为信息时代的时尚弄潮儿，通过头像展示法拉利钥匙的年代早已过去，而NFT头像则是一种证明自己跟上时代步伐的新潮流。不置可否，头像类的NFT也是艺术的一种表现形式，但是该类NFT的最终价值取决于品牌IP，亦或是背后的游戏生态或是web3赋能等，购买头像类NFT更像是对一家初创企业的投资，而不是对艺术收藏的投资。本文想简单聊一聊纯艺术类的NFT收藏，以及为什么要现在开始收藏NFT艺术品。\n\n![Chimera by Mpkoz](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zzpYyBrWCMpNl1t7u0T69.jpg?height=1869&width=1125)\n\nTwitter上一位藏家Artifaction给出了很好的解释，他的想法总结如下：\n\n> *文艺复兴、印象派、超现实主义、波普艺术.. 这些主义或者派系的诞生都早于我们出生的年代，我们已经不可能在法国街头买到那副印象派作品，或者在Andy Warhol刚有起色的时候成为他的藏家。这些时代都已经过去，而最新的艺术潮流（或者说某种艺术运动）正在我们眼前发生。艺术家们正在用新的技术媒介把作品铸造在区块链上。*\n>\n> *从投资角度来看，收藏NFT可以让家族的世世代代享受这些杰作。现在由各大拍卖行出售的艺术品大部分都由富有的个人和机构收藏着，昂贵的价格绝不是普通人能够拥有的。而对于最新的艺术趋势，我们掌握着收藏的主动权。我们有各种工具帮我们了解艺术家，有平台可以展示我们的藏品。收藏NFT艺术品是大势所趋，未来已来。*\n\n![Cosmic Reef by Leo Villareal - 在Artblocks Curated发布的这个系列非常特别且精美，很适合自己一个人晚上看着自嗨。](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ob50KWgHd8BFyDUNx-xtl.JPG?height=628&width=638)\n\n### 收藏NFT艺术品的好处？\n\nNFT艺术品是互联网和信息时代的产物，区块链的可追溯性、透明性、跨国界实时交易的便捷性以及（某种程度的）不可篡改让很多新媒体类艺术作品（比如摄影、视频、代码生成艺术、音乐、AR等）展现出其独有的价值。除此以外，收藏NFT的门槛往往比传统艺术收藏低很多。以下简单列出收藏NFT艺术品的优势。\n\n![Lil Heroes by Egar Plans](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_YWDeP9ORKZ8F77WeuBly.jpg?height=996&width=995)\n\n### 1. 价格亲民\n\n新兴艺术载体作为一种小众的存在，往往有着价格优势。无论是在艺术圈赫赫有名的蓝筹艺术家、或是加密艺术的新起之秀，如果能在他们发布NFT的早期收集他们的作品，在购买的价格上具有非常大的新引力，这些艺术品的发行价格往往在3000美金以下。比如Damien Hirst发售的Currency，发售价为2000美金；蔡国强老师的炸自己NFT，发售价为999美金；方力钧老师的Elemental，发售价大约为600美金；Leo villareal的Cosmic Reef, 发售价为1800美金； Edgar Plans的Lil’heroes,发售价大约为1500美金。作为行业早期红利，很多蓝筹艺术家在新兴领域会制定一个比较亲民的价格试水，所以如果能以发行价买到蓝筹艺术家的作品，会是一个比较稳妥的收藏和投资选择。\n\n![L'Informe I by Rachel Rose 这件作品的细节非常夸张，整个文件尺寸超过了100MB。在局部进行放大后仿佛看到了另外一副截然不同的作品，Rachel的创作非常用心。](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bnVhyEEH7mYSYWXaODjyQ.jpg?height=1007&width=763)\n\n### 2. 发售机制相对透明\n\n互联网的便捷性打破了传统艺术收藏的隔阂，让藏家可以清楚的了解到发售价格和发售机制。在传统艺术收藏中，普通藏家往往无法在一级市场购买到热门艺术家的作品。毕竟如果买到即赚到，为何让非VIP享受这种福利呢？当然，不置可否的是，相对exclusive的制度可以防止一些炒家进行短期套利的行为，但是对于一些刚开始收藏的藏家来说，二级市场的交易价格往往会昂贵很多。这些在传统艺术圈里的不透明性，在NFT艺术收藏中有一定的改善。NFT艺术品往往有比较清晰的发售规则，发售形式可能以抽奖，亦或者通过购买艺术家原有作品获取新作品的购买权。\n\n![Elemental by Fang Lijun](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LeRfqWrFqZKgHd073ZiWG.jpg?height=997&width=990)\n\n### 3. 保存、运输和防伪\n\n数据作为NFT艺术品的载体解决了艺术实体的收藏以及运输问题，你不需要调整室内合适的湿度，安装防盗系统，亦或是为艺术品的运输支付保险、税费等，也无需在出售的时候提供第三方鉴定机构的防伪证明。交易简单便利，只需要在交易所一键挂单，全世界的藏家都能通过交易平台查看并选择购买NFT艺术品。我觉得百达翡丽的广告词也可以很好的适用于NFT艺术品：没人能真正拥有NFT艺术品，你只是在替下一代保管它。手表或者实体艺术品容易丢失，损坏，而链上数据的拥有权掌握在私钥持有者手中。\n\n![Exploding the Self by Cai Guoqiang （视频截图）- 视频展示了火药创作的整个过程以及最后的成品，是蔡老师为自己创作的艺术家自画像。](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dWNEsmlJ3Jw04UGMU6OsQ.JPG?height=357&width=637)\n\n### 4. 相对便捷的展示与交易\n\n相交传统艺术品，NFT的流动性会好很多。对于传统艺术品，藏家往往需要通过画廊或者拍卖行出售自己的作品，不仅需要支付昂贵的服务费，而且耗时耗力。NFT艺术品的转售相对简单，可以在各大交易平台挂单后，通过Twitter或者Discord等沟通媒介，向其他潜在藏家通知和展示待出售的藏品。除此之外，也可以通过自己建立在线画廊，展示自己的收藏，提高关注度。需要提醒的是，艺术品始终是一个流动性比较低的投资标的，因此在购买艺术品的时候，选择自己喜欢的收藏更重要。\n\n### 收藏101\n\n如何进行收藏？我觉得简单来说就是选艺术家和选发行平台。\n\n对艺术家DYOR：DYOR意为自己做研究。互联网的透明性以及技术的便利性让我们可以很方便的对艺术家做详细的研究和了解，你可以非常便捷的浏览艺术家的主页、Instagram、twitter来判断他的作品是否符合你的审美。也可以快速的查询Superrare，Opensea等交易平台的交易记录来判断作品的保值/增值程度。甚至，你可以直接通过社交平台与他们直接联系或者进行日常互动，了解他们创作过程中的想法。关注一些大藏家和收藏机构也能让你收获到不少信息，并了解整个市场情况。藏家推荐：@artifaction2, @cozomoMedici, @curatedxyz （也欢迎关注我@weishi66199181）\n\n选择优秀的发行平台：普通人往往很难发掘蓝筹艺术家，专业的事情可以让专业的人来完成，因此跟踪好的艺术发行平台就非常的重要，并且可以帮助你省下很多时间和经历。在现实收藏中，我们都知道Pace、贝浩登等画廊扶持了很多优秀的艺术家，在web3世界，选择好的发行平台并在一级市场购入作品也是非常稳妥的投资方法。我推荐关注的平台有：Artblocks, Heni, ASH（PAK生态），TR Lab，Outland以及ZHEN，小众一点的平台有Feral File, BrainDrops, Async Art。也可以时刻关注苏富比、佳士得以及Pace画廊，他们也可能会推出NFT作品。\n\n以后有机会可以详细的写一个收藏的thought process。\n\n![Fragements by James Jean - James Jean](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hN53W2wCgT33SSwuK5AZu.JPG?height=638&width=638)\n\n### NFT作品和艺术家推荐（不定期更新）\n\n近期比较看好的艺术家：\n\n未透露的过世蓝筹艺术家（通过TRLAB平台发售）\n\nIan Cheng （通过Outland平台发售）\n\nTigerbob NFT\n\nPixel Blossom\n\n![Qu4ntum by Ness Graphic](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6UpEe3Q08WxnLbjz-i2j1.JPG?height=639&width=634)\n\n### 有潜力的领域\n\nAR+区块链+艺术会是个很有趣的领域，很期待Zhen能在这个领域做出些什么创新。We are still early.\n\n![Robot Shark by Hajime Sorayama - NFT持有人也是创作者，AR的艺术形式让艺术家和藏家共同创作（本图属于乱拍）。](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Pa6Ilrdvpf19TQ-dVGlVJ.jpg?height=579&width=1125)\n\n文中所有收藏，可以通过我创建的画廊进行欣赏：\n\n[https://deca.art/shanghairen/billion-dollar-collection](https://deca.art/shanghairen/billion-dollar-collection)\n\n下一篇会简单聊一聊音乐类NFT，以及我看好的音乐类NFT平台。", "timestamp": 1653278043, "digest": "J883tYQtMss4LZwlBy1dpRGLjav47CEfip1XJ8s5b9I", "contributor": "0x359B7628F98F3B73e9BdCb2D8476932342fC5aeA"}

{"id": "JpXE6aJiZrCWyZX2u03rX7FXonsQkxPSvvniE1k6d2o", "title": "ZK Rollup 简介", "body": "## 背景\n\n区块链公链自诞生以来，虽然大大降低了信任的门槛，但一直面临着一个效率问题：即 TPS 不高。例如比特币每秒仅支持7笔交易，而目前的以太坊也仅支持每秒 15 笔左右的交易。这样的 TPS 很支持大型应用。因此业界很多技术人员尝试为区块链扩容。目前扩容方案主要有两类：\n\n* Layer 1 扩容方案，即直接增加链上的交易处理能力，这种方式也被称为链上扩容。常见的技术方案有：Sharding 和 DAG；\n* Layer 2 扩容方案，即将链上的相当一部分工作量转移到链下来完成。常见的技术有：State Channel, [Plasma](https://learnblockchain.cn/categories/scaling/Plasma/), [Truebit](https://learnblockchain.cn/categories/scaling/TrueBit/) 和 最近比较火的 zk Rollup。\n\nZK Rollup 并非新概念，@barrywhitehat 在一年前提出，目前由 Matter Lab 和 den3 进行工程实现。\n\n## 原理\n\n* 那么，zk Rollup 背后的原理是什么？\n\nzk Rollup 的本质是将链上的用户状态压缩存储在一棵 Merkle 树中，并将用户状态的变更转移到链下来，同时通过 zkSNARK 的证明来保证该链下用户状态变更过程的正确性。在链上直接处理用户状态的变更成本是比较高的，但是仅仅利用链上的智能合约来验证一个零知识证明的 PROOF 是否正确，成本是相对低很多的。另外必要的转账信息也会被和证明一起提交到合约，方便用户查账。\n\n## 两类角色\n\nzkRollup 系统中包含两类角色：transactor 和 relayer。\n\n* transactor，即普通用户，对应以太坊上的外部账户。用户构建转账交易并用私钥签名，然后将交易发送给 relayer。\n* relayer 负责收集并验证用户的 transaction，之后将 transaction 批量打包，并生成 zkSNARK 的 PROOF，最终将用户 transaction 中的核心数据和 zkSNARK 的 PROOF 以及新的全局用户状态的 Merkle 根提交到链上的智能合约。\n\n当然 relayer 不会免费为 transactor 提供服务，毕竟 relayer 向链上提交证明和数据是需要消耗 gas 的。因此，transactor 向 relayer 发送的交易里，也必须包含相应的手续费。\n\n## 状态迁移函数\n\n当 relyer 收到 transaction 后，必须 “执行” 它。transaction 的执行，本质上是改变相关账户的状态，而 STF 就是改变账户状态的函数。STF 是状态迁移函数(state transition function)的缩写。\n\n状态是针对状态机而言的，每个状态机在某一时刻都有一个状态。我们可以假设某状态机的初始状态是 S\\[0\\]。当某个 Action T\\[1\\] 作用在该状态机上时，状态机的状态发生了迁移。我们可以用以下式子来表示迁移过程。\n\n```\nS[1] = STF(S[0], T[1])\n```\n\n这里，S\\[0\\] 是初始状态，S\\[1\\] 是状态机执行 Action T\\[1\\] 之后的状态。\n\n紧接着有新的若干 Action T\\[2\\], T\\[3\\], ..., T\\[n\\] 继续作用在该状态机上，则状态机的状态依次发生迁移。\n\n```\nS[2] = STF(S[1], T[2])\nS[3] = STF(S[2], T[3])\n...\nS[n] = STF[S[n-1], T[n]]\n```\n\n简单地，我们也可以将 T\\[1\\], T\\[2\\], ..., T\\[n\\] 看作一个整体，则状态迁移过程可以简化为：\n\n```\nS[n] = STF(S[0], T[1], T[2], ..., T[n])\n```\n\n更一般地，假设当前状态机的状态是 PRE_STATE，然后有 n 个 Action T\\[1\\], T\\[2\\], ..., T\\[n\\] 依次作用到状态机上，之后状态机的状态是 POST_STATE，此可以表示为：\n\n```\nPOST_STATE = STF(PRE_STATE, T[1], T[2], ..., T[n])\n```\n\n如果将以上 Action 换成转账交易 transaction，把 系统中的账户集合看作是一个状态机，那么整个过程也就是链上交易执行的过程了。交易的执行，使得整个链上的全局状态发生变化。链上的全局状态也就是各个账户的状态集合，将所有账户的状态组成一棵 Merkle 树，树的叶子节点是账户状态，树的根可以直接用来表示状态集合。因此，上述的 PRE_STATE 和 POST_STATE 也就是全局账户状态树的根。\n\n## 账户状态模型\n\n刚才我们提到链上的整个系统中的账户状态，可由一棵 Merkle 树来管理。Merkle 树的叶子节点，即用户的状态信息。同样，链下扩容方案 zk Rollup 也可以用类似的 Merkle 树来组织其账户状态。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PtdGoKEQCdFnwVFy52EAV.png?height=463&width=630)\n\n最简单的账户状态可以包含：账户的 public key，nonce 和 balance。而叶子节点在Merkle 树中是有唯一位置的，因此位置的索引信息可间接引用这个账户信息。\n\n如果我们用3个字节来表示这个索引信息的话，那么这棵 Merkle 树总共可以支持 2^24 = 16,777,216 个账户。这对于一般的系统来说已经足够。因此，以太坊为例，账户地址可以由 address 的 20个字节 转为 Merkle 树的叶子节点索引 3 个字节。这样账户地址就被“压缩”了。\n\n除了对账户地址进行压缩，我们也可以对转账金额数据进行压缩。例如，在以太坊上金额用256位的大整型来表示，但是实际使用过程中几乎很少用到超大金额和超小的金额。因此如果我们就假设系统中转账的最小单位是 0.001 ETH，并且用 4 个字节来表示转账金额的话，我们就可以支持 0.001 \\~ 4,294,967.295 ETH 的转账，这对于一般的系统来说也已经够了。如果还不够可以适当再增加字节来表示金额，或者引入浮点数表示方式。\n\n手续费与转账金额类似，实际手续费会在一定的范围之内浮动，因此我们也可以为手续费设定一个最小单位，例如：0.001 ETH。然后用 1 个字节来表示 0.001 \\~ 0.255 ETH 的手续费。这里的手续费也就是 transactor 向 relayer 支付的手续费。\n\n同样，我们假设在正常使用环境下一个账户的转账次数不会达到上万次，因此用2个字节来表示账户的 nonce 也差不多够了，因为 2 个字节 可以表示的范围达到 0\\~65535。\n\n最后签名字段不能压缩，以以太坊为例，签名 (r, s, v) 总共需要 65 个字节。但实际的zk Rollup 系统中使用 EdDSA的较多。\n\n因此，一个 transaction 的格式大体如下：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PMsUyHpher8Wt1uL7zJmD.png?height=117&width=577)\n\n以上 transaction 各字段的长度仅作参考，在实现具体系统的时候需要根据实际情况调整字段长度，以防止发生字段溢出的情况，但原则上还是能省则省。因为交易数据越少，在相同存储容量的前提下，所能容纳的交易数也就越多。\n\n## 证明和验证\n\n了解了状态迁移函数和账户状态模型后，我们再来了解下 relayer 收集 transaction 后做了些什么。\n\n我们刚才提到在 zk Rollup 的系统里，所有用户的账户信息由一棵 Merkle 树管理。而 Merkle 树的根被记录在了链上的智能合约里，这个根的值也代表着整个系统当前所有账户的状态。当有用户发起转账 transaction 时，这个状态就要发生改变。但改变必须依照规则进行。\n\n* 首先，必须要确保 transaction 的合法性：\n  * 转出账户是否有足够的钱支付转账金额和手续费\n  * 转出账户的 nonce 是否正确\n  * 转账 transaction 的签名是否正确\n* 接着，relayer 执行该转账 transaction，修改 Merkle 树中的转出账户和转入账户的叶子节点，然后重新计算新的 Merkle 树的根。\n* 重复第二步，relayer 会按照先后顺序一次性处理多个 transaction，然后将最后计算得到的 Merkle 树的根作为新的状态提交到链上合约中。\n\n但上述流程存在问题：如果仅提交状态树的根到合约，那么用户如何相信新的状态根是如实地根据上述逻辑计算出来的。万一 relayer 作恶，故意调大 transaction 的手续费呢？\n\n解决这个问题的一个方法是：要求 relayer 提交状态树的根到合约时，同时也将所有 transaction 提交到合约，这样任何人都可以根据这些 transaction 来验证 relayer 在计算新的状态树时，有没有作弊。但这等于是将所有链下的数据搬回了链上，没有实现 layer 2 扩容的目的。\n\n利用[零知识证明](https://learnblockchain.cn/categories/zkp/)就可以很好地解决这个问题。zk Rollup 中的 zk 也就是 zero-knowledge 的缩写。relayer 在收集了一系列的 transactions 后，需要用预先定义好的 ZK circuits 来生成一个 PROOF：\n\n* 确保每个交易 T\\[1\\], T\\[2\\], ..., T\\[n\\] 中的 nonce, value, fee 等值都没有问题，且 signature 正确。\n* 确保状态迁移过程没有问题，即 `STF(PRE_STATE, T[1], T[2], ..., T[n]) = POST_STATE`\n* 然后将这个 PROOF 与 POST_STATE, t\\[1\\], t\\[2\\], ..., t\\[n\\] 一起提交到链上合约。其中 t\\[1\\], t\\[2\\], ..., t\\[n\\]是 transaction 的简化信息，不包含 nonce 和 signature。所以 t\\[i\\] 比 T\\[i\\] 更小。\n\n然后智能合约只需要验证这个 PROOF 是否正确。如果 PROOF 正确且合约中保存的状态与 PRE_STATE 相等，那么新的状态 POST_STATE 将会被记录到合约中，替换原有状态。\n\n由于 relayer 必须生成 zkSNARK 的 PROOF，然后才能向合约提交，因此如果 relayer 作恶 修改用户的 transaction，那么 PROOF 将无法被验证通过。\n\n另外，由于提交到链上的交易 t\\[1\\], t\\[2\\], ..., t\\[n\\] 是不包含 nonce 和 signature 的，因此上链的数据将会变得更小（上例中每个 transaction 仅会有11个字节上链）。\n\n此时，relayer 由于证明的限制，已经无法修改用户的 transaction。但是 恶意的 relayer 依然可以拒绝为某个 transactor 服务，不搜集该 transactor 的 tranaction。为了防止这种行为，合约上必须支持 on-chain withdrawal，也就是任何一个 transactor 都可以从链上将自己的 token 提走。\n\n## zk Rollup 目前的应用\n\n目前一个典型的 zk Rollup 应用场景是去中心化的交易所，其代表是 [Loopring DEX Protocol (v3)](https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/blob/master/packages/loopring_v3/DESIGN.md)。有兴趣的小伙伴可以深入研究一下。\n\n此外，开源的 zk Rollup 框架还有：\n\n* [barryWhiteHat/roll_up -C++](https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/roll_up)\n* [matter-labs/rollup - rust](https://github.com/matter-labs/rollup)\n\n## 总结\n\nzk Rollup 是一种新型的 Layer 2 扩容方案，该技术的核心思想是：\n\n* 将主链作为存储媒介，而非共识引擎 ；\n* 将交易压缩，并在链下达成状态共识 ；\n* 用零知识证明保证链下状态共识的安全性。\n\n目前，zk Rollup 最典型的应用场景是去中心化的交易所。\n\nPPIO 也在积极探索 zk Rollup 技术，并尝试将其应用到 去中心化的带宽和存储交易领域中去。\n\n## 参考文献\n\n* [ZK Rollup: scaling with zero-knowledge

{"id": "LUciId418sdLhWdie2N539kTfLNjYficua4IEyF_MUU", "title": "《Castles the NFT 》调研报告", "body": "`——TSA 调研组：包子 制作`\n\n**// 特别强调：**\n\n1. 链游项⽬均为⾼⻛险项⽬，有复杂的经济模型\n2. 此份研报初衷在于项⽬分享，仅以目前（2022.4.5）的信息归纳分析汇总，情况可能不准确，不作为投资建议。\n\n## 1. 游戏简介\n\n“Castles the NFT 是一款以中世纪为背景的wax系链游，其实这款游戏的背景也没有什么太多要介 绍的，因为wax系的链游，大家都知道，就是挖挖挖…点点点…但是这个游戏貌似还有些属于它的特色， 今天就和大家好好的来聊一下这款游戏吧。\n\n### 1.1 土地\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UQthC9H7E_KYCogQe0oIx.png?height=330&width=1080)\n\n要介绍这款游戏，首先要介绍它的NFT，它的NFT比较多，当然，并不是种类多，而是等级比较多，什么意思呢，就是大部分都属于土地，但是土地分了很多个等级。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/L2j_TcKNADgCkkhd3EMkC.png?height=356&width=1080)\n\n从上面这个图我们可以看出，土地的等级有六个等级，分别是农场、乡、村、镇、城市以及城堡，不用说大家肯定也能猜得到，土地的等级肯定关乎奖励的高低。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q0uh5r9l0djzPaiU2LIOh.png?height=373&width=1080)\n\n上面那张图很清晰的说明了每个小时奖励的代币是多少，而且官方还特地把你有多少个，你能够得到多少代币都给你算得清清楚楚明明白白。土地的升级方式也很简单，就是3升1，3个1级合体成一 个2级， 3个2级合体成一个3级，以此类推，如果你想要1个6级城堡，咳咳，你需要729个1级牧场。\n\n### 1.2 人物--皇爵\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qkC26j0s4L5Uw25SOs6iZ.png?height=590&width=735)\n\n人物NFT也是这个游戏很有意思的一个点，每一个人物的效果都不一样，项目方还是 很有想法的。首先要给大家介绍的第一个人物NFT是整个游戏最重要的NFT之一。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QlZUvbZPI70jATMUk_SIE.png?height=378&width=1080)\n\n看上去东西很多，给大家归结三点：1.皇爵可以产生土地；2.皇爵总量有限。3. 有代币消耗机制。\n\n简单来说就是，皇爵可以不断增大玩家获取代币的能力，同时，因为皇爵总量有限，所以不会发生巨大的通胀。（当然，这也是相对的，如果玩家少，通胀是肯定有的，但是如果玩家多，那这1000多个皇爵，肯定就是天价了）\n\n### 1.3 人物--伐木工\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yR1AGi5kr32Zh0-FPnQM2.png?height=824&width=628)\n\n**伐木工是里面出现的第二种人物NFT，对于他，我们要了解的事是：**\n\n1. 他不是一直存在，是限时存在的一个NFT，准确的说应该是出现一段时间又消失一段时间，是一个周期 性存在的NFT。\n2. 他会产生一种全新的代币（伐木工当然是产生木头）\n3. 有代币消耗机制（不光是mint有代币消耗机制，是使用都有消耗机制）\n\n`人物---木匠 ？？？`\n\n**伐木工消失后，木匠就出来了，对于他，我们要了解的事是：**\n\n懂了人物的机制了没，出来一种就消失一种，而且一种和另一种是有联系的，比如伐木工伐木，木匠把伐木工伐的木头变成木板。同样的，它也有代币消耗机制。它的出现方式又不一样了，它可能会一直存在，但是和皇爵一样，限量……\n\n**各种人物NFT的代币消耗机制：**\n\n在这个游戏里，你光买了NFT是不够的，你想要让你的人物NFT工作，你还必须购买代币 和皇家印章才行，尤其是伐木工之后（包括伐木工）所有的人物NFT可以说都是买便宜， 后期工作需要的代币贵。\n\n举个例子，伐木工的造价是10W代币加2个皇家印章，但是伐木工每周的工资是40W代币外 加四个皇家印章，其实对于代币的消耗量是巨大的，尤其是那些已经上头的人，那产出 完全不够他们复投的。再加上一个又一个新代币的产生对前面代币的消耗也很大，所以 这个游戏的抛压，理论上来说会比其他的某些不能做到NFT去库存的游戏好一些。\n\n## 2. 代币\n\n### 2.1 皇家印章\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G9JrvjvzXC7cY770hBQ6i.png?height=516&width=424)\n\n其实说起来，皇家印章算是NFT的一种，但是我宁愿把它归结到代币里面来了，而且第一个介绍它，因为它真的是太重要了，没有它，你所有的人物NFT都没办法工作，没有它，你也无法去mint人物NFT, 而且它的产出， 5U一个，或者是最高级别土地，每天产出一个，所以，把它当成是整个游戏里最硬的硬通货吧。\n\n### 2.2 msource\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4FsyF-pzkhvIR1ed8ryjE.png?height=152&width=438)\n\n土地产生的代币，产出量比较大，抛压也比较大，复投基本上也会用到它，但是用得最多的还是变现吧。\n\n### 2.3 木头（ft）\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cgme9zwzKwlQUnQ1QFJP6.png?height=830&width=828)\n\n伐木工人产出的货币，可以直接在游戏里兑换成木头的NFT，这个东西往后可以通过木匠再加工成木板 ，木板是建造后期新建筑的必要材料。\n\n### 4.木板（？？？）\n\n接下来要登场的木匠用木头加工而成的新货币，相信肯定和木头一样能够转化为木板的NFT，为后期新建筑做准备。\n\n往后走以此类推就是了，新型的代币和新型的建筑材料会越来越多。\n\n## 3. 游戏理解\n\n按道理来说，到这儿就应该要讲到游戏的基本玩法了，但是对于这个游戏，玩法其实相对简单，文章的后面肯定还会再介绍一下的，在这里还是想先和大家聊一聊这个游戏该不该玩，有没有前途。\n\n这么说吧，在我的理解当中，这个游戏其实还是没有脱离矿游和所谓的gamefi1.0的范畴，但是它的 经济模型很有意思，这个游戏，说白了就是不停的进行套娃的一个过程，土地产生A，A开始慢慢的多起来， 准备出金，结果项目方推出了B，为了更好的获利，你的A必须复投，让你自己整个游戏得以延续下去，等你 B差不多该出金的时候，项目方又推出了C…简单来说就是通过增加池子的方式，来分摊前面代币池子的抛压 。这么看来乍一看利益并没有多少，但是实际上在这个过程中，如果游戏向好发展，代币价值上升，其实是 很不错的一个游戏。\n\n## 4.游戏玩法\n\n1\\. 最简单的进场方法就是去原子市场购买土地（可以直接买地，也可以买盲盒），然后不 断的用产出的代币去复投新的土地，有了3个就合成一个更高级别的，依次类推\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zEU6QV4MeHoNmbo-Gds4T.png?height=471&width=1080)\n\n三种盲盒，价格不一样，产出的土地NFT从数量到稀有度上都不一样。\n\n1. 第二种方法就是直接购买皇爵，皇爵每天都会产生一块土地，然后不断的复投复投，然 后出货出货。\n\n然后以上两种方法在此基础上，不断的购买新的人物NFT，在保留复投的代币的前提下，考虑出货或者是复投。\n\n## 4. 游戏总结\n\n游戏的经济模型相对来说有点儿意思，从经济模型的角度来讲是可以玩一下的，但是，经过上一波4大天王暴跌的行情之后，所有的“韭菜们”也没那么胆大了，稍稍一点风吹草动就 使劲砸盘，所以这个游戏现阶段来说，进场人数还是不太够，关键还是要看项目方是否作为， 如何作为吧。最后提醒大家，如果真的玩游戏了，记得，先回本是第一位的。\n\n## 5.相关链接\n\n推特：\n\n[https://twitter.com/MetasourceGames](https://twitter.com/MetasourceGames)\n\n官网：\n\n[https://metasourcecards.com/](https://metasourcecards.com/)\n\n## TSA 欢迎你的加入：\n\n[https://twitter.com/tsa_guild](https://twitter.com/tsa_guild)\n\n[https://discord.com/invite/TSACLUB](https://discord.com/invite/TSACLUB)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Mf2StiCHsSHYAcfAww4Ck.png?height=356&width=817)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653278721, "digest": "Z37O0CFdfwoV5NE9NpHDrAQEw36x5mB8GBX-eG1uHiw", "contributor": "0xeF96650E66688D5Fedb995432E28cdadDCcCBF71"}
