{"id": "IxxgXO2pjIQXLAfxdY2G794LELmxktXfyySJcL0qBPc", "title": "My Dream for the Planet School", "body": "Last week, I stepped off the *SSV* (Sailing School Vessel) *Corwith Cramer* after spending six weeks at sea as the 3rd Mate for “Marine Biodiversity & Conservation,” a college semester-at-sea program run by the Sea Education Association (SEA)*.* Coming aboard in Key West, Florida seven weeks ago marked 14 years since I had stepped onto *Cramer* as a student myself. I had never been sailing before and I had no idea how profoundly that voyage would impact me. They say that the sea is a great teacher and I agree, but the community we intentionally create at sea deserves description too.\n\nAn isolated ship at sea is, in many ways, an ideal medium for creating deeply impactful learning opportunities. For this inaugural Planet School blog post, I want to share why I love to teach at sea and how the core elements of an ocean-based curriculum do not actually need to be unique to the sea at all. To do that, I need to give a bit of background on what it means to go sailing for a semester on a tall ship.\n\n![Removing the crutch of GPS and navigating with the stars is yet another opportunity for authentic student agency.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2czv-EUWimA9Q8y4l-iNF.jpeg?height=450&width=600)\n\nMake no mistake: sailing is hard work. I suspect that many students, like me when I was 20 years old, perceive a semester aboard a sailboat as one of relaxing exoticism bordering on luxuriousness: perfect sunsets, dolphins chasing the bow, strumming a guitar, reading *Treasure Island* or *Moby Dick* and coming home with a perfect tan and a year’s worth of Instagram posts—no filter, obviously. After all, yachts are a pastime of the wealthy and the Caribbean is a vacation destination. While there are innumerable moments of grandeur to be had at sea and all of the things I listed above usually happen multiple times on every voyage, they belie the full story. Any notion of #YachtLife is a delusion that gets shaken almost instantly.\n\nStudents step onto the ship and they step into a new world. First, the language is completely different—both the immense vocabulary of nautical terminology as well as the style of repeating commands. When you are given a task, you repeat the command back to the person who just gave it to you, then you go do the task, then once the task is done you return to the person who gave you the task and tell them it is complete, which they then repeat back to you. This creates a closed loop—there is little chance for miscommunication—but that much repetition does not come naturally. So not only do students have multiple subject areas to master—navigation, seamanship, meteorology, watch standing duties, laboratory procedures—but their way of communicating is being frequently corrected. They are studying new subjects in a new language in a place that is constantly moving (making many of them seasick) and with a watch-standing schedule that means their sleep is inconsistent. On all fronts, my semester with SEA in college was, hands down, my most challenging term and Brown University was not exactly a cake walk.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wYOcovwOe7n5jeVg9IkIg.jpeg?height=3456&width=4608)\n\n## A Three Phase Approach\n\nEvery voyage program I have sailed on—SEA vessels and Proctor Academy’s Ocean Classroom semester—breaks their trip into three phases: The Spaghetti Phase, The Shadow Phase, and the Junior Watch Officer (JWO) Phase. The Spaghetti Phase is so named because, for the students, it feels like information is being thrown at them like spaghetti: some of it sticks and some (most) just falls to the deck. It could also be called the Firehose Phase because it can feel like drinking from a firehose. Whatever the metaphor, the first phase is characterized by feeling overwhelmed, adjusting to the boat, and being corrected frequently. It can be discouraging, so building unity within a student’s watch is important as is creating frequent moments for light hearted community building. The goal is for students to learn *what* to do and to see this behavior role-modeled by the staff.\n\nThe second phase (usually following two weeks of spaghetti) is when students start to shift to learning *why* things are done. During each watch, a student is selected to be the shadow and follow the mate through their duties. The mate narrates what they are doing as they do it, the student accompanies the mate when they check in with the captain, and the student starts to take the lead in various routines, like making sure the hourly boat checks and weather observations are completed. This is the chance to start peeking behind the curtain and feel invited to partake in the boat’s management.\n\nFinally, the JWO Phase. In many ways, the entire trip builds to the JWO Phase. During this phase, a student is elevated to the position of Junior Watch Officer during their watch and takes over for the mate. Students interact directly with the captain to respond to weather changes, recommend sail evolutions, and delegate tasks within their watch.  The JWO can even delegate tasks to the mate, so long as the task does not take the mate away from the quarterdeck for more than 10 minutes. While the mate is still the safety officer and legally responsible for the watch, they step back as much as possible. Mates are told to let mistakes happen and only yell “Hold!” if a student is about to injure someone or damage the boat. No reason is given for yelling “Hold!”, so action does not resume until the JWO or one of their watchmates discovers the problem and corrects it.\n\n![A JWO, wearing the \"JWO Hat,\" plotting the ship's position.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pw2OQCJQxLevILLX_gG1F.jpeg?height=3024&width=4032)\n\n## A Recipe for Great Learning\n\nThis three phase progression is where the magic happens. All three phases are essential; neither is successful without the other two. Most conventional classrooms never make it past the Spaghetti Phase. Conversely, if we were to skip the Spaghetti Phase, the students would not feel prepared for the greater responsibility asked of them. This progression works because of the learning environment that is very intentionally created by the staff, both in the program’s core design and through staff meetings that happen underway. That environment consists of a few essential ingredients:\n\n1. **Authenticity**. If students feel that their input and time is valued as part of an experience that is not “busy work,” they will invest in it. Since the boat is a real boat sailing on the ocean, everything connected to that objective being completed successfully is very clearly not busy work. There are very real consequences to not doing a job completely or correctly. This element drives home the value of “Seek Excellence.”\n2. **Relevance**. A student could be assigned the authentic task of digging a big hole or meticulously cleaning the interior components of an antique pocket watch but will probably lose interest if the question “why” is not answered. This can sometimes happen with boat checks, which happen every hour on a boat and begin to take on an element of blind routine if their value is not reinforced. When it comes to establishing relevance, the connection can be specific to the student, broad to society, temporal to the moment at hand, or tied to the legacy of the human race 10,000 years from now, but there must be an answer.\n3. **Ownership**. Of all the characteristics here, this is the one we see the most frequently in existing classrooms. High school students are given charge of completing their assignments, showing up to class on time, and discharging a multitude of duties. What I advocate for here is that we create more pathways for the sphere of ownership to keep expanding. We should reward great performance with greater ownership.\n4. **Agency**. This is different from ownership, perhaps even a step up from ownership. Agency combines ownership, relevance, and authenticity to create a moments where the student makes choices that have consequences. As a mate, when I delegate setting a sail to a student, I have given them ownership of that task. Often, the ownership of something means following a script for how that job needs to be done: there is a right way to set a sail and a myriad of wrong ways. Agency means writing the script.\n5. **Ability to Fail**. It is possible to create a learning environment where all of the above are present and yet the lesson still falls short on this final element. A JWO will feel authenticity, relevance, ownership, and agency by the nature of being JWO, but if the mate steps in to answer a tough question or offers an overly revealing hint, the ability to fail dissolves. In some ways, ability to fail creates a deeper layer of fusion between authenticity and the relevance of the experience that generate moments of genuine discomfort for students.\n\n   As a mate, a critical element in creating a successful JWO Phase is to step back and let the student make mistakes, or forget things, or become overwhelmed. This can be hard because I want my students to succeed, but I have come to appreciate that there needs to be a “butterfly emerging from the chrysalis” moment if the value of everything that happened up to that point is going to matter. A student can watch and study something a million times, but then it is their turn to step up and do it. Near the end of the novel *The Alchemist*, the alchemist describes this concept to the protagonist:\n\n> “What you still need to know is this: before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we’ve learned as we’ve moved toward that dream. That’s the point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one ‘dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.’\n>\n> Every search begins with beginner’s luck. And every search ends with the victor’s being severely tested.”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XFo5fuOKYfz2DwkCXIQz_.jpg?height=447&width=450)\n\nTo be clear, I am not talking about fear of failing as a person. Our classrooms already have this trait to a damaging degree with our modern grading system and the pressure of college admissions. I have frequently seen tears on JWO and while sometimes that is just how a person processes stress, there needs to be a calibration of duties with what a student is ready for, which varies by person. When I debrief with my JWO after the watch is over, a pointer I frequently remind them of is to not be too hard on themself when they fail: accept that you will make a mistake, take a moment to reflect on it, and then give yourself the grace to move past it and you can unpack the lesson later. As a leader, you must move past it or you will be distracted from your job in that moment. I also believe that a student needs, ideally, a minimum of three shifts as JWO to enable them to witness their own progress and internalize lessons. Most often, a student’s first JWO stint is not pretty and having that be their one shot would be unfortunate.\n\n## Beyond Sailing\n\nSailing for weeks at a time is an amazing adventure that makes creating many of these conditions easier, but in some ways it is not ideal. The sleep schedule, seasickness, and risk of burnout for staff and students are the most obvious downsides. Sailing is also an expensive and exclusive opportunity. And do we really need a boat in order to do any of this?\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\n![Planet School terms will begin with 4-5 weeks sailing and then transfer to a land campus, bringing along the ethos developed underway.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yh6OSBRAKEr2wfgdma3uE.jpeg?height=3024&width=4032)\n\nMy goal with the Planet School is to take this process that I have seen be so effective on sailboats and replicate it in other realms. A three phase progression carried out between a knowledgeable practitioner and a group of students can be done in almost any field: the leader of a “watch” need not be a professional mariner. The expert could be a farmer, an engineer, an economist, or an artist. The task need not be sailing, it could be starting a business, managing a farm, or building a yurt. It could even be building a school.\n\nThe underlying project of the Planet School is to build the school itself. Since a campus is a community, such an undertaking could reasonably include a project in almost any discipline, giving students the chance to explore their passions and be exposed to potential passions they have not experienced before. Some of my most potent memories from high school are from the activities that included role-playing of “real life”: speech and debate, theatre, Model UN, Youth Legislature, and the school newspaper. Through the prevalence of internships, externships, and youth employment as well as the cliche of how teenagers yearn to leave home, the desire for real world experience at that age is evident. We should build our schools to be authentic laboratories for trying out real world solutions. If we are to be better stewards of our planet, then we need to do more than encourage experimentation, bold thinking, and sustainability—we need to create education spaces where we actively train youth in those habits.\n\nI never imagined myself as a teacher. I never imagined myself working in education. Yet I have learned that any systemic reimagining of human civilization must begin with how we equip our future generations. My vision for school is that, whatever the project, students are challenged in an authentic, relevant way where they have agency, feel ownership, and are trusted to be able to fail.", "timestamp": 1653239582, "digest": "SiaaK_sDxGc1-zoy7KhbTktMsmr-WZmS8dSheqQM8Yc", "contributor": "0x505683cF3aDdF5DE8E82AABB9d24763B9A72aAD0"}

NFT游戏角色简介\n\n### 2.1 雪人Yeti\n\nYeti是游戏最主要的角色，它们可用于开采特定资源，具体取决于Yeti的种族类型和稀有度。 \n\n一共有9种不同的雪人，根据产出的不同可以分为三组类型：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vAsGagFc0aXYodf-AgWKq.png?height=263&width=554)\n\n拿着普通斧头、高级斧头，手拿普通锯子的雪人开采木头资源，每次开采需消耗能量和工具耐久度，耐久度可通过矿石代币修复。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5YSw19O1fsamU1y-TtNol.png?height=271&width=554)\n\n带电锯、普通镐和电钻的雪人开采矿石资源(millirium)，每次开采需消耗能量和工具耐久度，耐久度通过木头代币修复。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3MYMR2ANfzZv_wLaqA5v2.png?height=265&width=554)\n\n初学、中级和高级的雪人工程师是可再生能源生产的先驱，它们产出能量，每次开采仅消耗耐久，耐久需要通过矿石和木头来修复。\n\n### 2.2 护身符Amulet\n\n游戏中目前有6种不同的护身符，可以用于增加每次开采的资源数量，或减少每次开采所需要消耗的数量，同时将护身符放置到祭坛还可以产出一些spirit代币。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9nw67oE3IxfpdMcVCDmQ-.png?height=282&width=312)\n\n护身符除了可从atomichub交易市场购买，还可以使用木头、矿石和精神三种代币来制作。\n\n### 2.3 魔法砖magicbrick\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-epA4k2iHzHWgbxPy2aR1.png?height=346&width=430)\n\n小屋(cabin)是雪人们居住的建筑物，游戏初始为每个玩家提供了两间小屋，初始每间小屋仅可容纳一个同一类型的雪人，也就是如果你有两个工程师雪人NFT用于挖能量代币，可将它们分别放置到两个小屋中，但如果有第三个同样用于挖掘能量的雪人，就需要使用魔法砖来升级你的小屋。 \n\n蓝色和绿色魔法砖可用于增加小屋容量，普通cabin升级到大型cabin需要3块蓝色魔法砖或1块绿色魔法砖，大型升级到别墅需要6块蓝色魔法砖或2块绿砖，一个玩家最多可在游戏内放置18只不同类型的雪人。 \n\n粉色和紫色魔法砖则可用于增加使用护身符的插槽。\n\n \n\n### 2.4 土地land\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/B9wzz_HQZRDqr-7hphMyv.png?height=320&width=554)\n\n玩家除了挖掘资源，也可以选择持有一块或多块土地，每块土地有不同的开采类型和稀有度，土地所有者可从其他玩家在该土地上开采的资源中获得 2% 到 8% 的分润收益。 \n\n注意目前土地还未开始销售，另外如上图所示，在页面中心的阿曼达岛屿附近有六块大型岛屿(megaland)，官方后期将会举行拍卖会，它们每一块是普通土地面积的7倍，且该土地的所有者将和传奇土地所有者平分系统总佣金池的40%。\n\n \n\n## 3. 玩法流程 \n\n在对经济模型和游戏角色有个基础了解后，让我们来看看雪人家族的具体玩法： \n\n**进入游戏网站自动连接钱包：**\n\n[https://saar.game/](https://saar.game/)\n\n**第一次登录首先会看到资源选择页面：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vdC2xqfZ1zS57DBucooNs.png?height=329&width=554)\n\n根据你持有的雪人类型选择其中一种资源类型来采挖，玩家在同一时间段只能开采木头、矿石、能源这三种中的其中一种，如果你选择开采能源，而账号中还有挖掘木头的雪人，那它将只能产出spirit代币(无需消耗能量)。 \n\n玩家可自由切换采挖资源类型，但需要支付相应的代币，比如从挖能源切换到挖木头，需支付500个srw币。 \n\n**选择土地：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yIYHEJHdvNmdviTTCuKUe.png?height=287&width=554)\n\n土地可以选megaland或是周围的普通土地都可以，只要点击每块土地看到左侧详细信息里显示有choose for mining即可选择，土地选择需注意，如果是普通地，land type要选择和你主挖的资源一致的地，另外天气尽量选当前是sunny的，如果是其他天气类型会影响产出。\n\n \n\n**选好后在页面右下角点击Village进入游戏页面如下图所示：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4cCnUWahZUSIGs44sUNhq.png?height=308&width=554)\n\n**点击小屋，进入采挖页面：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6K5wHYo_jd99wwTM7YL82.png?height=316&width=554)\n\n根据你的雪人类型在右侧分栏选择合适的插槽放置NFT，放置好后如无显示刷新页面即可。\n\n**雪人放置好后即可开始采挖：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fFmRVQoPILIRN_7MqqIqN.png?height=320&width=554)\n\n上图是普通能量开采工程师的采挖页面，每1小时claim一次，一次大约可获得45.45个能量代币，消耗60个耐久度，需要12个矿石和18个木头代币来修复，这里玩家可选择每次去repair，也可以积累到耐久度用完。 \n\n另如果是挖木头或矿石，采挖时需要消耗能量，因此要事先充入一些能量代币到游戏中。 \n\n以上就是雪人家族大致的流程，目前claim间隔默认是1小时，每支付5个spirit币可将claim间隔时间延长1小时。 \n\n**收益方面团队暂时没有给官方的ROI表，这里附上一份社区玩家做的表格：**\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iOYDIqOca5KLEZB3QS6Eqs5TblaK0oE9dB2VnXgCGzs/edit#gid=2079524431](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iOYDIqOca5KLEZB3QS6Eqs5TblaK0oE9dB2VnXgCGzs/edit#gid=2079524431)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XuB9ij_hikVtKoIYzx9pR.png?height=251&width=554)\n\n可以填入你想配置的NFT，参考下大致的ROI，但需要注意，游戏内数据是动态变化的，它这里记录的消耗产出和实际存在出入，同时没有考虑手续费和精神代币的产出，所以它只是暂时的参考，从目前观察来看，产出矿石和能量的ROI比木头要好，同时等级越高的收益越高，不考虑价格波动，史诗传奇的ROI平均在10天上下，相对普通的在30天以上。\n\n## 4. 项目测评及潜力分析\n\nSAAR雪人家族是比较典型的多币制挖矿游戏，这也是目前市场主流的一种经济模型，玩家可选择不同的玩法策略，token之间互为供需，可使游戏维持更长期的经济平衡。 \n\n相对于市场同类项目，SAAR的主要亮点一是通过第四种代币sws的消耗，来延长claim时间间隔，达到一定程度的自动化采挖，从同类项目来看，这种设计是有一定玩家需求的。 \n\n另一个是天气状况的设计，每块土地每24小时都可能会有不同的天气变化，Sunny太阳天不会对玩家有任何影响，Windy阴天，有30%概率产生，它会减少Yeti15%的产出量，有10%的几率遇到Snowstorm暴风雪天，在这种天气条件下，开采量减少50%，同时消耗量翻倍，对于普通NFT，这时玩家可能需要选择停工。 \n\n天气的变量增加了游戏的随机性，同时也有助于对游戏内各种资源供需进行动态调整，通过对近年来链游市场的观察，我们也发现，经济模式不只是写在白皮书和表格里的单一数据，随着游戏的发展，能进行有效的动态调节对项目的长期很重要。 \n\n问题方面目前来说可能最主要的还是市场偏小众，据Dappradar数据，日活用户数在500左右，这里主要原因可能在于随着加密市场进入熊市，链游市场一直萎靡不振，特别是近期wax价格大幅下跌，也导致很多玩家离场，另外该项目从销售到上线的时间间隔稍长，现在也会存在一点热度缺失，包括NFT市场交易量暂时不高，还需要看团队在未来是否能够通过一些营销或市场活动激发更多玩家的兴趣。 \n\n不过市场趋冷对玩家来说不一定是坏事，像现在市场上的入门包也就在10-30刀不等，风险可控，所以它还是比较适合一些喜欢玩这种采挖游戏的玩家去体验。 \n\n对于未来的关注点一是制作合成，从NFT市场来看，他家各类型的雪人体量并不是特别大，早期包八九成也都被打开，随着用户增长，有望刺激合成需求，合成消耗更多的代币，代币价值增长再推动更多的用户增长，这也是这种挖矿合成类主要的增长模式。 \n\n另一个就是土地，目前官方还未公布销售规则，对玩家来说，它可能也是该游戏接下来的一个机会点。\n\n## 相关链接\n\n`官推：`\n\n[https://twitter.com/SaaR_nft](https://twitter.com/SaaR_nft)\n\n`白皮书：`\n\n[https://whitepaper.saar.network/](https://whitepaper.saar.network/)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653239757, "digest": "MIbMrEPFslnl04gAUayyZ2CpW313s_6GVvk6md56GEI", "contributor": "0xeF96650E66688D5Fedb995432E28cdadDCcCBF71"}

With that in mind, we’ve decided to do things a little differently and base our launch on (possibly) the rarest commodity in this market: awareness. Welcome to our stealth launch.\n\n\n---\n\n*The ASX Genesis Event has arrived.

There's no vesting. 100% of the max supply will be unlocked and circulating on day one.\n* Once the soft cap is reached (250,000,000 ASX minted), a countdown of 10 days will start. When it hits zero, the Genesis Event will end, the initial liquidity pool on Uniswap will be created and the remaining ASX will be burned along with the liquidity provider (LP) token.\n* ASX ERC-20 smart contract address: **0x5313235002b9F11698D7B9187Be44f836FEbD6b5**.\n\n\n---\n\n## A unique token launch\n\nAs a community-focused project committed to the ethos and founding principles of the blockchain space, we are pleased to announce the official launch of **ASX**, the governance token of the ASX Protocol.\n\nIn the spirit of equal distribution, fairness, decentralization, and a community-first ideology, the launch event is taking place on our [custom-made platform](https://mint.asx.st/) and it's the first and only opportunity for anyone to get access to the ASX Protocol's native token, **ASX**, which will give holders the power to govern and curate essential infrastructure components of the network.\n\nOur mission is to give everyone in our community an opportunity to become a stakeholder in the ecosystem, and we want to extend that opportunity as fairly as possible. Launching ASX on our own platform, with a mechanism that is fair and transparent for all participants, drastically increases the chances of achieving this mission.\n\nApart from building our own token launch platform, we made sure everyone was on a level playing field. There's no seed or private sale, no liquidity mining, no emission (zero inflation), zero tokens to influencers or promoters, no airdrop, and zero Treasury, Company, Founders, Team, or Partners allocation.\n\n### 1 billion ASX tokens. 800 million to be minted, 200 million for liquidity. That's it.\n\n> *The protocol's revenue will exclusively serve ASX holders and all operations will be funded with ETH or stablecoins.*\n\nThe ASX Genesis Event is open to all interested and qualifying parties. It's a major milestone for the ASX Protocol ecosystem and speaks to the viability of our core technology and business model as we aim to become the ultimate permissionless omnichain liquidity hub for staked assets.\n\nAt ASX Labs, we believe in creating a global staking ecosystem of the people, by the people, for the people, that shall not perish under any threats. The crypto dream has never been about creating an instrument that can easily be put in a box, but about creating global assets that can govern and manage these new decentralized global networks.\n\n## Understanding the mechanics\n\nTo mint 1 ASX you need to contribute 0.000004 ETH. A total of 800,000,000 ASX will be available for minting. Due to the low fully diluted market cap of the project and to ensure as broad a distribution as possible and dramatically soften the potential for a massive gas war, we decided to operate in stealth mode until 50% of the tokens are minted.\n\nThere's a minimum of 1 ASX per mint and no maximum. Setting up a max cap per wallet without KYC is foolish and we're not big fans of KYC in DeFi. For us, privacy and freedom are paramount, and we respect and stand by yours. With that said, there's a cap of 100 ETH per mint on our Interface just to slow things down, if they get a bit crazy.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to hear about the ASX Protocol early, you'll have enough time to participate. Otherwise, you can get ASX tokens on Uniswap, after the Genesis Event is completed.\n\n## How to participate\n\nParticipating in the ASX Genesis Event is simple, quick, and intuitive, and getting prepared is even easier. Here’s what you’ll need:\n\n→ **An Ethereum-compatible web3 browser wallet**, such as MetaMask. You can generate a wallet address from these web3 wallets directly, or use your seeds to import an existing wallet address.\n\n→ **Sufficient ETH**, which you will need in order to contribute and pay for transactions gas fees.\n\nOnce you’ve got your checklist all set, here’s what the process will look like:\n\n1. To get started, head to our custom-made [Launch Platform](https://mint.asx.st/).\n2. You’ll be prompted with a welcome message. Click on \"**PARTICIPATION TERMS**\". Read everything and, if you agree, click on \"**I AGREE**\". Next, click on \"**CONTINUE**\".\n3. The next message will be a TL;DR of the ASX Genesis Event. Carefully read everything and click on \"**CONTINUE**\".\n4. You can now connect your wallet. We support almost any web3 injected wallet, but for a flawless experience, we recommend using MetaMask. Click on \"**CONNECT WALLET**\", either in the center or on the upper right-hand corner of the page.\n5. Once your wallet is connected, the ETH and ASX input fields will become available to you. You may either insert the amount of ASX you would like to receive or the amount of ETH you would like to contribute. Enter the desired amount and click on \"**MINT**\". Please make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet to pay for transaction fees.\n6. You will see a popup from your MetaMask wallet. Confirm the transaction and then wait for it to go through. Once it is validated on the Ethereum blockchain, your ASX balance, on the top of the page, will update and a \"CLAIM\" button will appear. You will be able to claim your ASX tokens once the event is completed.\n7. That's it! You successfully participated in the ASX Genesis Event.\n\n*Once your transaction is validated, a smart contract, that works like an escrow, will receive your ASX tokens and keep them safe until the end of the Genesis Event, when you will be able to claim them. Claimed ASX tokens are not locked and there is no vesting.*\n\n*Team and partners are allowed to participate in the Genesis Event after the progress bar reaches 50%. If the desired amount of ASX that those parties intend to hold can't be fully minted during this event, the remaining amount will be purchased on Uniswap.*\n\n## Liquidity\n\nBy the end of the Genesis Event, the initial liquidity of the ASX token will be immediately provided as a full range position on Uniswap V3. Since the resulting liquidity provider (LP) token will be directly burned, this initial position will be perpetual.\n\nThe liquidity depth will represent 40% of the FDV (Fully Diluted Value) and its absolute value will be based on the total ASX minted.\n\n* At soft cap, 250 ETH will be paired with 62,500,000 ASX, pricing the token at $0.0077 / ASX with $962,500 of liquidity depth.\n* At hard cap, 800 ETH will be paired with 200,000,000 ASX, pricing the token at $0.0077 / ASX with $3,080,000 of liquidity depth.\n\n*The Genesis Event will end in 10 days after the soft cap is reached or when all ASX tokens are minted, whichever comes first. Any unminted ASX will be burned.*\n\n## Security\n\nWe were very careful when deciding the code for the ASX ERC-20 smart contract and, to make it the safest possible, we only allowed the absolutely necessary lines of code. There's no mint function, no pause function and the contract is not upgradeable. It is an immutable token on the Ethereum Mainnet Network.\n\nBoth the ERC-20 and the Genesis Event smart contracts were developed with the highest levels of security, leveraging the battle-tested OpenZeppelin standard. With the entire supply circulating by the end of the Genesis Event plus the immediate burn of the liquidity provider (LP) token, you can rest assured that the ASX token can never be hacked or rugged.\n\n### Important Notes\n\nThe team at ASX Labs will NEVER DM YOU FIRST or ask you for money on any platform. You should be very skeptical of any DMs received by anyone claiming to be from ASX Labs.\n\nOnly trust ASX Protocol's official channels at the bottom of this announcement for information surrounding the event.\n\nThe ASX token will only be available once the Genesis Event is completed. Only then you will be able to trade it on Uniswap. Be sure to always check the smart contract address before trading.\n\n\n---\n\nThis is the first step towards an omnichain yield future.

With that in mind, we’ve decided to do things a little differently and base our launch on (possibly) the rarest commodity in this market: awareness. Welcome to our stealth launch.\n\n\n---\n\n*The ASX Genesis Event has arrived. Please read this article carefully to understand the novel mechanics of this event.*\n\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\n*Values in US$ consider ETH priced at $1,925.*\n\n* **Token:** ASX (ERC-20) → Governance Token of the ASX Protocol\n* **Network:** Ethereum Mainnet\n* **Total / Max Supply:** 1,000,000,000 ASX\n* **Genesis Event Allocation:** 800,000,000 ASX\n* **Initial Liquidity Allocation:** 200,000,000 ASX\n* **Mint Rate:** 1 ASX / 0.000004 ETH or 250,000 ASX / 1 ETH\n* **Venue:** Self-hosted at <https://mint.asx.st/>\n* **Mode:** First-come, first-served basis (FCFS)\n* **Start date**: Live now\n* **End date**: 10 days after the soft cap is reached\n* **Soft Cap:** 1000 ETH | 250,000,000 ASX minted\n* **Hard Cap:** 3200 ETH | 800,000,000 ASX minted\n* **Fully Diluted Market Cap / Value (FDV)**\n  * **at Soft Cap:** 312,500,000 ASX \\~ $2,406,250 | 687,500,000 ASX burned\n  * **at Hard Cap:** 1,000,000,000 ASX \\~ $7,700,000 | 0 ASX burned\n* **Initial Liquidity (40% of FDV)**\n  * **at Soft Cap:** 62,500,000 ASX + 250 ETH | \\~ $962,500\n  * **at Hard Cap:** 200,000,000 ASX + 800 ETH | \\~ $3,080,000\n* There's no founders or team allocation, no seed or private sale, no liquidity mining, and no airdrop. The Genesis Event is the first and only place to get ASX tokens before listing.\n* Team and partners are allowed to participate after the progress bar reaches 50%.\n* Participants can claim their ASX tokens once the event is completed. There's no vesting. 100% of the max supply will be unlocked and circulating on day one.\n* Once the soft cap is reached (250,000,000 ASX minted), a countdown of 10 days will start. When it hits zero, the Genesis Event will end, the initial liquidity pool on Uniswap will be created and the remaining ASX will be burned along with the liquidity provider (LP) token.\n* ASX ERC-20 smart contract address: **0x5313235002b9F11698D7B9187Be44f836FEbD6b5**.\n\n\n---\n\n## A unique token launch\n\nAs a community-focused project committed to the ethos and founding principles of the blockchain space, we are pleased to announce the official launch of **ASX**, the governance token of the ASX Protocol.\n\nIn the spirit of equal distribution, fairness, decentralization, and a community-first ideology, the launch event is taking place on our [custom-made platform](https://mint.asx.st/) and it's the first and only opportunity for anyone to get access to the ASX Protocol's native token, **ASX**, which will give holders the power to govern and curate essential infrastructure components of the network.\n\nOur mission is to give everyone in our community an opportunity to become a stakeholder in the ecosystem, and we want to extend that opportunity as fairly as possible. Launching ASX on our own platform, with a mechanism that is fair and transparent for all participants, drastically increases the chances of achieving this mission.\n\nApart from building our own token launch platform, we made sure everyone was on a level playing field. There's no seed or private sale, no liquidity mining, no emission (zero inflation), zero tokens to influencers or promoters, no airdrop, and zero Treasury, Company, Founders, Team, or Partners allocation.\n\n### 1 billion ASX tokens. 800 million to be minted, 200 million for liquidity. That's it.\n\n> ***The protocol's revenue will exclusively serve ASX holders and all operations will be funded with ETH or stablecoins.***\n\nThe ASX Genesis Event is open to all interested and qualifying parties. It's a major milestone for the ASX Protocol ecosystem and speaks to the viability of our core technology and business model as we aim to become the ultimate permissionless omnichain liquidity hub for staked assets.\n\nAt ASX Labs, we believe in creating a global staking ecosystem of the people, by the people, for the people, that shall not perish under any threats. The crypto dream has never been about creating an instrument that can easily be put in a box, but about creating global assets that can govern and manage these new decentralized global networks.\n\n## Understanding the mechanics\n\nTo mint 1 ASX you need to contribute 0.000004 ETH. A total of 800,000,000 ASX will be available for minting. Due to the low fully diluted market cap of the project and to ensure as broad a distribution as possible and dramatically soften the potential for a massive gas war, we decided to operate in stealth mode until 50% of the tokens are minted.\n\nThere's a minimum of 1 ASX per mint and no maximum.

I had never been sailing before and I had no idea how profoundly that voyage would impact me. They say that the sea is a great teacher and I agree, but the community we intentionally create at sea deserves description too.\n\nAn isolated ship at sea is, in many ways, an ideal medium for creating deeply impactful learning opportunities. For this inaugural Planet School blog post, I want to share why I love to teach at sea and how the core elements of an ocean-based curriculum do not actually need to be unique to the sea at all. To do that, I need to give a bit of background on what it means to go sailing for a semester on a tall ship.\n\n![Removing the crutch of GPS and navigating with the stars is yet another opportunity for authentic student agency.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2czv-EUWimA9Q8y4l-iNF.jpeg?height=450&width=600)\n\nMake no mistake: sailing is hard work. I suspect that many students, like me when I was 20 years old, perceive a semester aboard a sailboat as one of relaxing exoticism bordering on luxuriousness: perfect sunsets, dolphins chasing the bow, strumming a guitar, reading *Treasure Island* or *Moby Dick* and coming home with a perfect tan and a year’s worth of Instagram posts—no filter, obviously. After all, yachts are a pastime of the wealthy and the Caribbean is a vacation destination. While there are innumerable moments of grandeur to be had at sea and all of the things I listed above usually happen multiple times on every voyage, they belie the full story. Any notion of #YachtLife is a delusion that gets shaken almost instantly.\n\nStudents step onto the ship and they step into a new world. First, the language is completely different—both the immense vocabulary of nautical terminology as well as the style of repeating commands. When you are given a task, you repeat the command back to the person who just gave it to you, then you go do the task, then once the task is done you return to the person who gave you the task and tell them it is complete, which they then repeat back to you. This creates a closed loop—there is little chance for miscommunication—but that much repetition does not come naturally. So not only do students have multiple subject areas to master—navigation, seamanship, meteorology, watch standing duties, laboratory procedures—but their way of communicating is being frequently corrected. They are studying new subjects in a new language in a place that is constantly moving (making many of them seasick) and with a watch-standing schedule that means their sleep is inconsistent. On all fronts, my semester with SEA in college was, hands down, my most challenging term and Brown University was not exactly a cake walk.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wYOcovwOe7n5jeVg9IkIg.jpeg?height=3456&width=4608)\n\n## A Three Phase Approach\n\nEvery voyage program I have sailed on—SEA vessels and Proctor Academy’s Ocean Classroom semester—breaks their trip into three phases: The Spaghetti Phase, The Shadow Phase, and the Junior Watch Officer (JWO) Phase. The Spaghetti Phase is so named because, for the students, it feels like information is being thrown at them like spaghetti: some of it sticks and some (most) just falls to the deck. It could also be called the Firehose Phase because it can feel like drinking from a firehose. Whatever the metaphor, the first phase is characterized by feeling overwhelmed, adjusting to the boat, and being corrected frequently. It can be discouraging, so building unity within a student’s watch is important as is creating frequent moments for light hearted community building. The goal is for students to learn *what* to do and to see this behavior role-modeled by the staff.\n\nThe second phase (usually following two weeks of spaghetti) is when students start to shift to learning *why* things are done. During each watch, a student is selected to be the shadow and follow the mate through their duties. The mate narrates what they are doing as they do it, the student accompanies the mate when they check in with the captain, and the student starts to take the lead in various routines, like making sure the hourly boat checks and weather observations are completed. This is the chance to start peeking behind the curtain and feel invited to partake in the boat’s management.\n\nFinally, the JWO Phase. In many ways, the entire trip builds to the JWO Phase. During this phase, a student is elevated to the position of Junior Watch Officer during their watch and takes over for the mate. Students interact directly with the captain to respond to weather changes, recommend sail evolutions, and delegate tasks within their watch.  The JWO can even delegate tasks to the mate, so long as the task does not take the mate away from the quarterdeck for more than 10 minutes. While the mate is still the safety officer and legally responsible for the watch, they step back as much as possible. Mates are told to let mistakes happen and only yell “Hold!” if a student is about to injure someone or damage the boat. No reason is given for yelling “Hold!”, so action does not resume until the JWO or one of their watchmates discovers the problem and corrects it.\n\n![A JWO, wearing the \"JWO Hat,\" plotting the ship's position.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pw2OQCJQxLevILLX_gG1F.jpeg?height=3024&width=4032)\n\n## A Recipe for Great Learning\n\nThis three phase progression is where the magic happens. All three phases are essential; neither is successful without the other two. Most conventional classrooms never make it past the Spaghetti Phase. Conversely, if we were to skip the Spaghetti Phase, the students would not feel prepared for the greater responsibility asked of them. This progression works because of the learning environment that is very intentionally created by the staff, both in the program’s core design and through staff meetings that happen underway. That environment consists of a few essential ingredients:\n\n1. **Authenticity**. If students feel that their input and time is valued as part of an experience that is not “busy work,” they will invest in it. Since the boat is a real boat sailing on the ocean, everything connected to that objective being completed successfully is very clearly not busy work. There are very real consequences to not doing a job completely or correctly. This element drives home the value of “Seek Excellence.”\n2. **Relevance**. A student could be assigned the authentic task of digging a big hole or meticulously cleaning the interior components of an antique pocket watch but will probably lose interest if the question “why” is not answered. This can sometimes happen with boat checks, which happen every hour on a boat and begin to take on an element of blind routine if their value is not reinforced. When it comes to establishing relevance, the connection can be specific to the student, broad to society, temporal to the moment at hand, or tied to the legacy of the human race 10,000 years from now, but there must be an answer.\n3. **Ownership**. Of all the characteristics here, this is the one we see the most frequently in existing classrooms. High school students are given charge of completing their assignments, showing up to class on time, and discharging a multitude of duties. What I advocate for here is that we create more pathways for the sphere of ownership to keep expanding. We should reward great performance with greater ownership.\n4. **Agency**. This is different from ownership, perhaps even a step up from ownership. Agency combines ownership, relevance, and authenticity to create a moments where the student makes choices that have consequences. As a mate, when I delegate setting a sail to a student, I have given them ownership of that task. Often, the ownership of something means following a script for how that job needs to be done: there is a right way to set a sail and a myriad of wrong ways. Agency means writing the script.\n5. **Ability to Fail**. It is possible to create a learning environment where all of the above are present and yet the lesson still falls short on this final element. A JWO will feel authenticity, relevance, ownership, and agency by the nature of being JWO, but if the mate steps in to answer a tough question or offers an overly revealing hint, the ability to fail dissolves. In some ways, ability to fail creates a deeper layer of fusion between authenticity and the relevance of the experience that generate moments of genuine discomfort for students.\n\n   As a mate, a critical element in creating a successful JWO Phase is to step back and let the student make mistakes, or forget things, or become overwhelmed. This can be hard because I want my students to succeed, but I have come to appreciate that there needs to be a “butterfly emerging from the chrysalis” moment if the value of everything that happened up to that point is going to matter. A student can watch and study something a million times, but then it is their turn to step up and do it. Near the end of the novel *The Alchemist*, the alchemist describes this concept to the protagonist:\n\n> “What you still need to know is this: before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we’ve learned as we’ve moved toward that dream. That’s the point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one ‘dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.’\n>\n> Every search begins with beginner’s luck. And every search ends with the victor’s being severely tested.”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XFo5fuOKYfz2DwkCXIQz_.jpg?height=447&width=450)\n\nTo be clear, I am not talking about fear of failing as a person. Our classrooms already have this trait to a damaging degree with our modern grading system and the pressure of college admissions. I have frequently seen tears on JWO and while sometimes that is just how a person processes stress, there needs to be a calibration of duties with what a student is ready for, which varies by person. When I debrief with my JWO after the watch is over, a pointer I frequently remind them of is to not be too hard on themself when they fail: accept that you will make a mistake, take a moment to reflect on it, and then give yourself the grace to move past it and you can unpack the lesson later. As a leader, you must move past it or you will be distracted from your job in that moment. I also believe that a student needs, ideally, a minimum of three shifts as JWO to enable them to witness their own progress and internalize lessons. Most often, a student’s first JWO stint is not pretty and having that be their one shot would be unfortunate.\n\n## Beyond Sailing\n\nSailing for weeks at a time is an amazing adventure that makes creating many of these conditions easier, but in some ways it is not ideal. The sleep schedule, seasickness, and risk of burnout for staff and students are the most obvious downsides. Sailing is also an expensive and exclusive opportunity. And do we really need a boat in order to do any of this?\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\n![Planet School terms will begin with 4-5 weeks sailing and then transfer to a land campus, bringing along the ethos developed underway.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yh6OSBRAKEr2wfgdma3uE.jpeg?height=3024&width=4032)\n\nMy goal with the Planet School is to take this process that I have seen be so effective on sailboats and replicate it in other realms. A three phase progression carried out between a knowledgeable practitioner and a group of students can be done in almost any field: the leader of a “watch” need not be a professional mariner. The expert could be a farmer, an engineer, an economist, or an artist. The task need not be sailing, it could be starting a business, managing a farm, or building a yurt. It could even be building a school.\n\nThe underlying project of the Planet School is to build the school itself. Since a campus is a community, such an undertaking could reasonably include a project in almost any discipline, giving students the chance to explore their passions and be exposed to potential passions they have not experienced before. Some of my most potent memories from high school are from the activities that included role-playing of “real life”: speech and debate, theatre, Model UN, Youth Legislature, and the school newspaper. Through the prevalence of internships, externships, and youth employment as well as the cliche of how teenagers yearn to leave home, the desire for real world experience at that age is evident. We should build our schools to be authentic laboratories for trying out real world solutions. If we are to be better stewards of our planet, then we need to do more than encourage experimentation, bold thinking, and sustainability—we need to create education spaces where we actively train youth in those habits.\n\nI never imagined myself as a teacher. I never imagined myself working in education. Yet I have learned that any systemic reimagining of human civilization must begin with how we equip our future generations. My vision for school is that, whatever the project, students are challenged in an authentic, relevant way where they have agency, feel ownership, and are trusted to be able to fail.", "timestamp": 1653240036, "digest": "SiaaK_sDxGc1-zoy7KhbTktMsmr-WZmS8dSheqQM8Yc", "contributor": "0x505683cF3aDdF5DE8E82AABB9d24763B9A72aAD0"}

{"id": "l5UF_vuCanTR12l4OciB1z_OMSvMAAg9N3f18-Up1N4", "title": "ASX Genesis Event", "body": "## Not you usual TGE\n\nThere have been many debates about what the fairest token generation event mechanism would be, but a consensus has yet to be reached. With that in mind, we’ve decided to do things a little differently and base our launch on (possibly) the rarest commodity in this market: awareness. Welcome to our stealth launch.\n\n\n---\n\n*The ASX Genesis Event has arrived. Please read this article carefully to understand the novel mechanics of this event.*\n\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\n*Values in US$ consider ETH priced at $1,925.*\n\n* **Token:** ASX (ERC-20) → Governance Token of the ASX Protocol\n* **Network:** Ethereum Mainnet\n* **Total / Max Supply:** 1,000,000,000 ASX\n* **Genesis Event Allocation:** 800,000,000 ASX\n* **Initial Liquidity Allocation:** 200,000,000 ASX\n* **Mint Rate:** 1 ASX / 0.000004 ETH or 250,000 ASX / 1 ETH\n* **Venue:** Self-hosted at <https://mint.asx.st/>\n* **Mode:** First-come, first-served basis (FCFS)\n* **Start date**: Live now\n* **End date**: 10 days after the soft cap is reached\n* **Soft Cap:** 1000 ETH | 250,000,000 ASX minted\n* **Hard Cap:** 3200 ETH | 800,000,000 ASX minted\n* **Fully Diluted Market Cap / Value (FDV)**\n  * **at Soft Cap:** 312,500,000 ASX \\~ $2,406,250 | 687,500,000 ASX burned\n  * **at Hard Cap:** 1,000,000,000 ASX \\~ $7,700,000 | 0 ASX burned\n* **Initial Liquidity (40% of FDV)**\n  * **at Soft Cap:** 62,500,000 ASX + 250 ETH | \\~ $962,500\n  * **at Hard Cap:** 200,000,000 ASX + 800 ETH | \\~ $3,080,000\n* There's no founders or team allocation, no seed or private sale, no liquidity mining, and no airdrop. The Genesis Event is the first and only place to get ASX tokens before listing.\n* Team and partners are allowed to participate after the progress bar reaches 50%.\n* Participants can claim their ASX tokens once the event is completed. There's no vesting. 100% of the max supply will be unlocked and circulating on day one.\n* Once the soft cap is reached (250,000,000 ASX minted), a countdown of 10 days will start. When it hits zero, the Genesis Event will end, the initial liquidity pool on Uniswap will be created and the remaining ASX will be burned along with the liquidity provider (LP) token.\n* ASX ERC-20 smart contract address: **0x5313235002b9F11698D7B9187Be44f836FEbD6b5**.\n\n\n---\n\n## A unique token launch\n\nAs a community-focused project committed to the ethos and founding principles of the blockchain space, we are pleased to announce the official launch of **ASX**, the governance token of the ASX Protocol.\n\nIn the spirit of equal distribution, fairness, decentralization, and a community-first ideology, the launch event is taking place on our [custom-made platform](https://mint.asx.st/) and it's the first and only opportunity for anyone to get access to the ASX Protocol's native token, **ASX**, which will give holders the power to govern and curate essential infrastructure components of the network.\n\nOur mission is to give everyone in our community an opportunity to become a stakeholder in the ecosystem, and we want to extend that opportunity as fairly as possible. Launching ASX on our own platform, with a mechanism that is fair and transparent for all participants, drastically increases the chances of achieving this mission.\n\nApart from building our own token launch platform, we made sure everyone was on a level playing field. There's no seed or private sale, no liquidity mining, no emission (zero inflation), zero tokens to influencers or promoters, no airdrop, and zero Treasury, Company, Founders, Team, or Partners allocation.\n\n### 1 billion ASX tokens. 800 million to be minted, 200 million for liquidity. That's it.\n\n> *The protocol's revenue will exclusively serve ASX holders and all operations will be funded with ETH or stablecoins.*\n\nThe ASX Genesis Event is open to all interested and qualifying parties. It's a major milestone for the ASX Protocol ecosystem and speaks to the viability of our core technology and business model as we aim to become the ultimate permissionless omnichain liquidity hub for staked assets.\n\nAt ASX Labs, we believe in creating a global staking ecosystem of the people, by the people, for the people, that shall not perish under any threats. The crypto dream has never been about creating an instrument that can easily be put in a box, but about creating global assets that can govern and manage these new decentralized global networks.\n\n## Understanding the mechanics\n\nTo mint 1 ASX you need to contribute 0.000004 ETH. A total of 800,000,000 ASX will be available for minting. Due to the low fully diluted market cap of the project and to ensure as broad a distribution as possible and dramatically soften the potential for a massive gas war, we decided to operate in stealth mode until 50% of the tokens are minted.\n\nThere's a minimum of 1 ASX per mint and no maximum. Setting up a max cap per wallet without KYC is foolish and we're not big fans of KYC in DeFi. For us, privacy and freedom are paramount, and we respect and stand by yours. With that said, there's a cap of 100 ETH per mint on our Interface just to slow things down, if they get a bit crazy.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to hear about the ASX Protocol early, you'll have enough time to participate. Otherwise, you can get ASX tokens on Uniswap, after the Genesis Event is completed.\n\n## How to participate\n\nParticipating in the ASX Genesis Event is simple, quick, and intuitive, and getting prepared is even easier. Here’s what you’ll need:\n\n→ **An Ethereum-compatible web3 browser wallet**, such as MetaMask. You can generate a wallet address from these web3 wallets directly, or use your seeds to import an existing wallet address.\n\n→ **Sufficient ETH**, which you will need in order to contribute and pay for transactions gas fees.\n\nOnce you’ve got your checklist all set, here’s what the process will look like:\n\n1. To get started, head to our custom-made [Launch Platform](https://mint.asx.st/).\n2. You’ll be prompted with a welcome message. Click on \"**PARTICIPATION TERMS**\". Read everything and, if you agree, click on \"**I AGREE**\". Next, click on \"**CONTINUE**\".\n3. The next message will be a TL;DR of the ASX Genesis Event. Carefully read everything and click on \"**CONTINUE**\".\n4. You can now connect your wallet. We support almost any web3 injected wallet, but for a flawless experience, we recommend using MetaMask. Click on \"**CONNECT WALLET**\", either in the center or on the upper right-hand corner of the page.\n5. Once your wallet is connected, the ETH and ASX input fields will become available to you. You may either insert the amount of ASX you would like to receive or the amount of ETH you would like to contribute. Enter the desired amount and click on \"**MINT**\". Please make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet to pay for transaction fees.\n6. You will see a popup from your MetaMask wallet. Confirm the transaction and then wait for it to go through. Once it is validated on the Ethereum blockchain, your ASX balance, on the top of the page, will update and a \"CLAIM\" button will appear. You will be able to claim your ASX tokens once the event is completed.\n7. That's it! You successfully participated in the ASX Genesis Event.\n\n*Once your transaction is validated, a smart contract, that works like an escrow, will receive your ASX tokens and keep them safe until the end of the Genesis Event, when you will be able to claim them. Claimed ASX tokens are not locked and there is no vesting.*\n\n*Team and partners are allowed to participate in the Genesis Event after the progress bar reaches 50%. If the desired amount of ASX that those parties intend to hold can't be fully minted during this event, the remaining amount will be purchased on Uniswap.*\n\n## Liquidity\n\nBy the end of the Genesis Event, the initial liquidity of the ASX token will be immediately provided as a full range position on Uniswap V3. Since the resulting liquidity provider (LP) token will be directly burned, this initial position will be perpetual.\n\nThe liquidity depth will represent 40% of the FDV (Fully Diluted Value) and its absolute value will be based on the total ASX minted.\n\n* At soft cap, 250 ETH will be paired with 62,500,000 ASX, pricing the token at $0.0077 / ASX with $962,500 of liquidity depth.\n* At hard cap, 800 ETH will be paired with 200,000,000 ASX, pricing the token at $0.0077 / ASX with $3,080,000 of liquidity depth.\n\n*The Genesis Event will end in 10 days after the soft cap is reached or when all ASX tokens are minted, whichever comes first. Any unminted ASX will be burned.*\n\n## Security\n\nWe were very careful when deciding the code for the ASX ERC-20 smart contract and, to make it the safest possible, we only allowed the absolutely necessary lines of code. There's no mint function, no pause function and the contract is not upgradeable. It is an immutable token on the Ethereum Mainnet Network.\n\nBoth the ERC-20 and the Genesis Event smart contracts were developed with the highest levels of security, leveraging the battle-tested OpenZeppelin standard. With the entire supply circulating by the end of the Genesis Event plus the immediate burn of the liquidity provider (LP) token, you can rest assured that the ASX token can never be hacked or rugged.\n\n### Important Notes\n\nThe team at ASX Labs will NEVER DM YOU FIRST or ask you for money on any platform. You should be very skeptical of any DMs received by anyone claiming to be from ASX Labs.\n\nOnly trust ASX Protocol's official channels at the bottom of this announcement for information surrounding the event.\n\nThe ASX token will only be available once the Genesis Event is completed. Only then you will be able to trade it on Uniswap. Be sure to always check the smart contract address before trading.\n\n\n---\n\nThis is the first step towards an omnichain yield future.

(the full text is 3588 words and takes about 5 − 10 minutes to read.)\n\nWe mean that as long as we have chased and loved each other, we can have an “Internet anniversary” every day, every year, for this young people to have fun and celebrate. If we are not even, we can also find online confidants. (I really hope that KK’s birthday can also catch this carnival on May 11 next year.)\n\n0406, 0505, seventh and ninth anniversaries… Looking back on these anniversaries this year, it is really more and more lively, and the more lively it is, the more prominent the coldness of the Internet. Youdao is in response to that sentence - busy anniversary, barren Internet.\n\nSo, do the beautiful days that I’ve heard of really exist?\n\n“The reason why we are here today is to celebrate the birthday of our best friend, Gu Li…”\n\nThe standard script for Ms. Gu Li’s birthday, oh, the same day is also her father’s memorial day, or the “rotten and smelly day” of the time sisters. From birthday greetings, birthday entries, birthday posters to outdoor screens, the little rich woman of the times is no less than an artist.\n\nMr. Liu mintao’s “red high heels” is the first direct shot actress in the history of internal entertainment. One must be arranged to commemorate the direct shot.\n\nIn the twinkling of an eye, sister Xun’s “a lot of people” expression bag has been for several years. By the way, it is Lu Fei and crayon Xiaoxin’s birthday on the same day. I wish the two Taurus children a happy birthday.\n\nAs for the grand carnival of “Internet anniversary”, at least not the draft.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2021, we watched the domestic entertainment talent show from the first year to hot and then to quietly end.\n\nThe first year, the day when the limited group ninepercent became a group, announced the arrival of a new era, and many people’s dreams began from this day;\n\nIn the second year, unine, a limited group, successfully promoted the era of draft automation because of its random ranking distribution;\n\nIn the third year, there was no debut night and no group. The building of internal entertainment draft was stopped when it was built to the second floor, which indirectly became a “uncompleted residential building”. Since then, it has become Xiufen’s “Qingming Festival”.\n\n“Youth 3” ixform made its debut quietly in an unnamed music. The debut night of the finals that failed to be broadcast was quietly buried together with the draft, which is sad.\n\nThe internal entertainment talent show has changed for only three or four years. Seeing him rise from a tall building, see his banquet guests, and see his building collapse, now, Xiufen people recall their youth by relying on the pictures of memories and on a special anniversary day.\n\nDo you want this blessing?\n\nA “Legend of Zhen Huan” can be said to have kept LETV I prosperous.\n\nMany years later, there are still a large number of audiences “passing the love pass”. The founder of Hua’er film and television, the producer of the legend of Zhen Huan, said: “the legend of Zhen Huan can bring more than 10 million profits to Hua’er film and television (which has been acquired by LETV) every year.”\n\nWell, why not?\n\nWhether it’s the birthday of ANN bird, the memorial day of Zhen Huan’s return to the palace, or the 300 year anniversary of the legend of Zhen Huan, it’s the audience’s real love for the play,\n\nThe audience is willing to look at a carefully carved work with a magnifying glass and see it again and again, which also shows that the audience has enough patience and appreciation ability for the work with real intention.\n\nFrom the examination questions of level 10 of the legend of Zhen Huan to how many episodes you can live in the palace, a variety of extended topics and challenges are still active on the platform today. This play seems to have become the spice of public life. Every day in the real-time square, people will plead with the creators of the legend of Zhen Huan to abide by the law and discipline, so as not to get the work off the shelves and become a public enemy of the whole people.\n\nSource: microblog screenshot\n\nThis year marks the ninth anniversary of the launch of the legend of Lu Zhen. Looking back on the whole story, Lu Zhen, an outstanding female representative of the Northern Qi Dynasty who was brave and firm and earned the position of Prime Minister for herself under the rule of the imperial power by relying on her own wisdom, is still a unique presence in the current TV series market.\n\nIn the past nine years, the actor himself has been in hot demand since his unknown place of origin. After a rough and hard journey, he finally got to Xintiandi and became the “85 flower” in the front line. I don’t know how ah Zhen, who is parallel to time and space, has also experienced unknown hardships. Is he happy with ah Zhan?\n\nOn the anniversary of another variety show “informal talks”, which has been with you for seven years, Chen Mingfa said that seven years is not a short life journey. His eldest daughter is seven years old. He saw some friends offline and told him that they were accompanying them from junior high school / high school to University / graduate school. He felt very honored to accompany you through your youth. These seven years of unhealthy time are also his youth and his UFO.\n\nThis UFO is straight ahead in any direction. It can take him to any place he wants to go, see the scenery, talk about any topic, and never die. He has been looking forward to seeing you again.\n\n“I can’t live without you.”\n\nLove me, scold me, whatever you want\n\n“Of course, I will be very moved. It shows that my acting skills have been recognized. We believe that there are such people around us. We believe that he (the role) has really come to the world. As an actor, there is nothing happier than this.” This is the true feeling of an actor who once worked with KK.\n\nThe time spent with the character is three months, six months or even longer to enter another person’s life and become this person. Experience his life and experience his joys and sorrows. “Sometimes it’s difficult to say goodbye. The hardest thing is to convince yourself that he doesn’t exist. If someone can remember him except me, at least he’s not so lonely.”\n\nThe audience can remember their own plays and characters, and even celebrate their birthdays and anniversaries outside the play. Remembering his life is a great affirmation for the actors.\n\nAt the most beautiful night BiliBili party in 2021, Zhang Wanyi, the actor of Chen Yannian in the awakening age, played a song “misplaced time and space”.\n\nPicture by network picture by network\n\nWhen the sound of leather shoes and chain rings at the same time, roles and players meet across time and space, maybe I", "timestamp": 1653240614, "digest": "RFaxcNKON4OJ8eGGLNGtFmiAL-IzfYeP6LeOFCsUZM4", "contributor": "0x1a79643D49D2C41D0E17B3Ad0DB838a27F85679a"}
{"id": "ID2VDvxQLTLDX4NJONhVShcga_zvVZ9CWUSq4YmAwjI", "title": "Heroines", "body": "So, we are very excited to announce \"The Heroines\" finally.\n\nBack in October, when we first started working on Heroes of the Metaverse,  one of the first decisions we had to make was how we would deal with the percentages of characters that would be males vs. females.\n\n***Who decides what?***\nHistorically, both in the NFT space and in the RPG/D&D world, women have been infra represented, and we did not want to reproduce the same stereotypes.\n\nThe logical decision was to divide the % of male characters vs. female characters by 50/50, closing the issue. Anything else would have been either negative or positive discrimination.\n\nAnd, of course, we didn’t want to dillute the series unnecessarily.\n\n## The five male founders dilemma\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the five founders are male heroes made us feel highly uncomfortable with the fact of creating Female Characters. Cesar Drawss -our Creative Director and artist- was the first one to raise the voice that he should not be the one designing female characters.\n\nBut in that early stage, the only members of Heroes of the Metaverse were the five founders.\n\nSo, all of these facts made us realize we were not comfortable or ready to launch the Heroines simultaneously as the Heroes.\n\n## Doodles: the inspiration\n\nAs everyone in this space wants to make something lasting and beautiful, we like to learn from everyone. And if there's someone we love about the NFT space is the creativity, the rule-breaking attitude, and the possibility of using technology to disrupt the status quo of what is possible and what's not.\n\n![Space Doodles is a subtle and brilliant innovation](https://doodles.app/images/doodle_plane.gif)\n\nAnd when Doodles announced the Space Doodles, what caught our attention was the technology they used. For us, the wrapped NFTs technology is one of the greatest innovations in the NFT space since the Azuki's ERC721A smart contract.\n\nEven if only a tiny percentage of people realize what this could become in the future, we also see this could be a great way to transform your Male Hero into a Female Hero. And, with it, let the market choose the % of female heroes vs. male heroes.\n\n## The Heroines\n\nAfter learning how the wrapped NFTs work, we decided not to use this technology.\n\nSince the change of sex is a variable and an image, we didn't need it as it does not bring any other value to the user. If we had wanted to use the wrapped NFTs, we would have required a second contract and a utility tool to enable the wrapping for the user. That would represent an unnecessary cost for the holder since the gas fee would have been much higher than how we are doing it.\n\nWe will create the Heroines transformation by ***uploading different JSON and image files to IPFS, and only modifying the file names while retrieving the token URI*.** As if it were two sides of one same coin. There is no tech innovation here, but this will ensure as much gas as possible as no extra code is written in the contract.\n\n![Switch from Hero to Heroine whenever you want. Cost = 0ETH + gas.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XI7iZg3UIJ-wbq2WqCrte.jpg?height=1080&width=1080)\n\n***These are the essential points of the transformation:***\n\n* You will be able to transform your Hero into a Heroine whenever you want and vice-versa.\n* The Heroines will be available some weeks after the first King's election.\n* The cost for converting your Hero will be 0ETH + gas.\n* Female artists have created our Heroes to ensure they lead the way of \"how a heroine should look like.\"\n* There will be a tool so everyone can see what the counterpart version would look like -even if not visible on marketplaces.", "timestamp": 1653240694, "digest": "rwRckqLH7RZ-zCPspfmfa64oUFMrJ0cwjbSvVT0JJrE", "contributor": "0x3cD877CF87DE6Bfc7f23eB4D0B3C20cb5a6FD080"}

{"id": "VlOwH3hRwLpzkf-cM4KI3L5w7VW0V9Bs5aG4iZfOM_U", "title": "How we found our Teddy :)", "body": "Last summer Sam FaceTime'd me & was talking to me about NFT’s. I knew what NFT’s were before we had that conversation but just never paid attention to it. He said : bro this space is perfect for you, don’t ask me why just go on twitter & join any NFT twitter space and you’ll find your journey, I am so excited to see where this story goes from here…\n\nI still remember saying : bro it’s 4 in the morning rn on a Saturday night and you’re telling me to go on twitter space rn and follow some monkey’s??? lol\n\nIn my mind I was like this dude’s lit & out of his right frame of mind. Finishing our sentences he said Teddy trust me, I know you and I am telling you this is a one way ticket to the life you have always dreamed but never lived and opportunities like this are very hard to find. I just laughed at it and I was like I’ll think about it and let you know…\n\nThen after a week I was playing soccer with Shadow in my backyard thinking about what Sam said the other day and the way he said it it was full of light. I could literally feel those good vibes. Btw Sam is a well known artist in the space, and now after spending all this time in this space I get it why he was hyper that day. Anyways, then I went on my twitter and switched my profile form private to public. I joined my first twitter space, It was with @NFTPrince & NFTsquirrels. Both are living legends and I respect them a lot. They shared tons of selfless advice to me on first day without even knowing who I was, what my real name is, or how I looked like. The knowledge was so valuable that basically I’ve never been rugged / scammed in this space till date. \n\nAfter spending some time in different spaces and observing how everything is working in this ecosystem, I focused on the fundamentals, the way people interact and react with certain things, what values they carried, and how do they find their feeling of importance. It was’nt very difficult for me to figure these things out because of my knowledge & experience with Social Media for over 5 years. I grew 36 million+ followers on Instagram via different entertainment pages and a network of over 250 million+ followers via networking in less than 6 months with just 2,000$ to start with from my college dorm.\n\nDuring that time Bored Ape’s were just flying and they still are but the vibes were immaculate last year you can’t deny that. I literally did a PHD on them and I was just astounded by their story but I was able to relate a lot of it to my life, it was so inspiring and fascinating. I was thinking so much about it, that even in my dreams I was seeing NFT’s all around me and my life changed the night of September 30 when i had that one lucid dream, I decided to do a project to share my story so that others can relate to it and be a part of it. \n\n( Note : This was’nt the main reason for me to do a NFT project. My main goal was and is still the same today that I want to leave this NFT space better than how I found it. )\n\nBack to the story, why Teddy? Well obviously. My friend’s call me Teddy and Teddies have been a part of everyone’s childhood and I believe people will hold on to that tradition forever. They provide us the comfort & companionship, a friend to talk to, and it’s not just kids who benefit from the positive effects of a comforting Teddy squeeze. Teddies are just universal and timeless.\n\nI put all of my traits and character and imagination’s in the art, from my expressions to the way I dress. Some of the assets are added for the aesthetics of the collection. I am not an artist but since I was the character I worked with few freelance artist’s to bring my idea on paper. They asked me for a sketch to give an idea of what I wanted and this is what I sent them lmao 😂😂😂😂😂😂\n\n![ That Yu-Gi-Oh and LV belt part has my heart lmaoooo😭😭😭. Tbh this image is still a lot better than my first one. Btw I am not rich lol, I don't have a AP watch or fancy items.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p7SJwXfpBXm-_G9fiTlu0.jpg?height=1280&width=960)\n\n![This looks decent lol. Lot better than what I came up with.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vxl5Z9dogU0G7wxHt-euI.png?height=1280&width=720)\n\n![That's me on the Left! Dw I am doxed to all our past holder's and lot of people in NFT space know me irl. My identity is just not public in the space atm. I'll reveal it when time is right.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CL1JyGEQS_ynX1v0M1WGn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nBack to the story, so once I got this I reached out to few professional artist’s in my network and I worked with multiple of them to find the perfect Teddy. We wanted to stick with 2D because 3D art is great but the market seemed to be doing well with 2D more than 3D collections. Ofcs art style isn’t the main reason for it but it does play a role. But then I am like let’s take the challenge and create something insane. During the time when I started the project, their were’nt any 3D project’s coming out just yet nor there were any noticeable Teddy Bear collections popping as long as I know. So then we decided to turn this into 3D. During this process one 3D artist reached out to me in my DM’s of one our meme page asking to collab, I am like okay cool lets give it a shot and see what you got. \n\n![This is what he came up with as base model. 💀💀💀](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FcshCcWqBzufElk9puKnW.png?height=772&width=778)\n\nYeah he just lost me on that base model. If ur surprised, I did’nt see this coming either, when I saw it for the first time I was out of words just like you are rn. I seriously had no comments on this image. So yeah I had to say no to that dude and look for another artist. The fact that people fake their LinkedIn and show you proof of work of other artist is just hilarious. So I asked one of my friend on telegram if he knew any artist to connect me and he did. \n\n![Idk tbh, it was just not it.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z3yiJzSTaGmqQdaHZroTJ.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nIt just did’nt feel right going with the full body at this point, gave pfp style a shot and see how it does. Initially the idea was, we will do pfp collection and in a seperate contract and we will give the holders full body version of their Teddy so they have both and can use it the way they like whether to animate or so with the source file…\n\n![I finally said yes to this one and made a deal with the artist and gave her an upfront amount for her time that we both agreed on. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ef-d0SnN5nrZH4EpHIfbn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThe reason why I paid upfront was because she told me she had financial instability and urgently need of money for rent and expenses so she would’nt be able to work full time on this project and it would take lot longer to complete the collection than what I was expecting. Plus I genuinely wanted to help her regardless of if she would work for the project or not due to her situation.\n\n![My mind, Her skills.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q7q8YdENYDP5zDlajLh05.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nWe decided to fully render and rigg the collection in the end after all the traits and assets are illustrated and confirmed so that their isn't any confusions and nothing is left out. But unfortunately she died in a car accident 3 days before our launch. I found out about it next day of her death from my friend I was completely devasted but I was more sad for her and her family. I communicated with our community and told them that guys we do not have the collection fully rigged and its in between 2D and 3D so we would have to pause the project for now until we find another artist and see how things go from there. \n\nBut then I was also out of funds because I put everything I had in the project initially. So I communicated this with the community in our discord and 34 people ended up minting 100 regardless of the situation. 10 were minted for team and 1 was minted by me personally to participate in the process just like any other member of community. They knew that mint had zero value and won’t have a secondary market value but yet they still supported. All they asked me was to not quit on my dream and to the challenge to make a come back from this situation. The collection won’t ever be revealed for the respect and honor of our artist. We communicated this with our holders as well and they are okay with it. A small portion of funds from royalties of our new collection will go towards her Family. Here’s the OpenSea link to that collection :\n\n[https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub](https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub)\n\nThen after I did an outreach again and managed to find a team of 4 professional 3D artist’s. Their past ventures have involved working with brands like Puma, Bangs and Lulu Lemon. Their Identities are anon as they wish to keep it that way but I have confirmed the veracity of their credentials. When I presented this entire idea and vision of the collection to them, after hearing me they instantly said yes and told be that we’re gonna make the best collection of 2022. We started working on it the same day and even with this team, I worked 1 on 1 with the team over screen shares for every single trait’s and asset’s and outcomes are just fantastic. Look It does’nt matter what people think of it but we do believe it is one of the greatest NFT collections that will ever be deployed on Blockchain. We’ve put our blood, sweat and tears in this collection as a team day in and day out. The collection is timeless & it will age well I can make that one promise for sure. \n\n![This collection is dedicated to someone who does'nt need to own it. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wKl-h3xgt9G73xjvxW_7_.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThe story will never have an end to be honest and I am just the captain of the boat as of now but at some point I want to hand the dream over to the community in a position that even if I am not present the story live forever as long as their is imagination left in this world.

{"id": "lIHG8Eoa04PwKjNsr4-_J18_bDEbzLsPrMtXL0oy2uQ", "title": "How we found our Teddy :)", "body": "Last summer Sam FaceTime'd me & was talking to me about NFT’s. I knew what NFT’s were before we had that conversation but just never paid attention to it. He said : bro this space is perfect for you, don’t ask me why just go on twitter & join any NFT twitter space and you’ll find your journey, I am so excited to see where this story goes from here…\n\nI still remember saying : bro it’s 4 in the morning rn on a Saturday night and you’re telling me to go on twitter space rn and follow some monkey’s??? lol\n\nIn my mind I was like this dude’s lit & out of his right frame of mind. Finishing our sentences he said Teddy trust me, I know you and I am telling you this is a one way ticket to the life you have always dreamed but never lived and opportunities like this are very hard to find. I just laughed at it and I was like I’ll think about it and let you know…\n\nThen after a week I was playing soccer with Shadow in my backyard thinking about what Sam said the other day and the way he said it it was full of light. I could literally feel those good vibes. Btw Sam is a well known artist in the space, and now after spending all this time in this space I get it why he was hyper that day. Anyways, then I went on my twitter and switched my profile form private to public. I joined my first twitter space, It was with @NFTPrince & NFTsquirrels. Both are living legends and I respect them a lot. They shared tons of selfless advice to me on first day without even knowing who I was, what my real name is, or how I looked like. The knowledge was so valuable that basically I’ve never been rugged / scammed in this space till date. \n\nAfter spending some time in different spaces and observing how everything is working in this ecosystem, I focused on the fundamentals, the way people interact and react with certain things, what values they carried, and how do they find their feeling of importance. It was’nt very difficult for me to figure these things out because of my knowledge & experience with Social Media for over 5 years. I grew 36 million+ followers on Instagram via different entertainment pages and a network of over 250 million+ followers via networking in less than 6 months with just 2,000$ to start with from my college dorm.\n\nDuring that time Bored Ape’s were just flying and they still are but the vibes were immaculate last year you can’t deny that. I literally did a PHD on them and I was just astounded by their story but I was able to relate a lot of it to my life, it was so inspiring and fascinating. I was thinking so much about it, that even in my dreams I was seeing NFT’s all around me and my life changed the night of September 30 when i had that one lucid dream, I decided to do a project to share my story so that others can relate to it and be a part of it. \n\n( Note : This was’nt the main reason for me to do a NFT project. My main goal was and is still the same today that I want to leave this NFT space better than how I found it. )\n\nBack to the story, why Teddy? Well obviously. My friend’s call me Teddy and Teddies have been a part of everyone’s childhood and I believe people will hold on to that tradition forever. They provide us the comfort & companionship, a friend to talk to, and it’s not just kids who benefit from the positive effects of a comforting Teddy squeeze. Teddies are just universal and timeless.\n\nI put all of my traits and character and imagination’s in the art, from my expressions to the way I dress. Some of the assets are added for the aesthetics of the collection. I am not an artist but since I was the character I worked with few freelance artist’s to bring my idea on paper. They asked me for a sketch to give an idea of what I wanted and this is what I sent them lmao 😂😂😂😂😂😂\n\n![ That Yu-Gi-Oh and LV belt part has my heart lmaoooo😭😭😭.

Presque tous les réseaux blockchain vantent le nombre élevé de transactions par seconde (TPS) comme un argument de vente. Cependant, le TPS n'est pas une mesure valable pour comparer les réseaux blockchain, ce qui rend difficile l'évaluation de leurs performances relatives. De plus, les grands nombres de TPS ont généralement un coût, ce qui pose la question suivante : ces réseaux sont-ils réellement évolutifs ou se contentent-ils d'augmenter leur débit ?\n\nExaminons donc comment définir la scalabilité, quels compromis sont faits pour y parvenir et pourquoi les Validity Rollups constituent la solution la scalabilité par excellence.\n\n### Toutes les transactions ne sont pas égales\n\nTout d'abord, nous devons établir notre affirmation selon laquelle la mesure simple et pratique des TPS ne sont pas une mesure précise de la scalabilité.\n\nPour compenser les nœuds pour l'exécution des transactions (et pour dissuader les utilisateurs de spammer le réseau avec des calculs inutiles), les blockchains facturent des frais proportionnels à la charge de calcul imposée à la blockchain. Dans Ethereum, la complexité de la charge de calcul est mesurée en gas. Le gas étant une mesure très pratique de la complexité des transactions, le terme sera utilisé tout au long de cet article pour les blockchains autres qu'Ethereum, même s'il est généralement spécifique à Ethereum.\n\nLes transactions diffèrent considérablement en termes de complexité et, par conséquent, de quantité de gas qu'elles consomment. Bitcoin, le pionnier des transactions de pair à pair (P2P) trustless, ne prend en charge que le rudimentaire script Bitcoin. Ces simples transferts d'adresse à adresse consomment peu de gas. En revanche, les chaînes de smart contract comme Ethereum ou Solana prennent en charge une machine virtuelle et des langages de programmation complets de Turing qui permettent des transactions beaucoup plus complexes. Par conséquent, les dApps comme Uniswap nécessitent beaucoup plus de gas.\n\nC'est pourquoi il est absurde de comparer les TPS de différentes blockchains. Ce que nous devrions plutôt comparer, c'est la capacité de calcul ou débit.\n\nToutes les blockchains ont une taille de bloc (variable) et un temps de bloc qui déterminent combien d'unités de calcul peuvent être traitées par bloc et à quelle vitesse un nouveau bloc peut être ajouté. Ensemble, ces deux variables déterminent le débit d'une blockchain.\n\n## Qu'est-ce qui limite la scalabilité ?\n\nLes blockchains s'efforcent d'être des réseaux inclusifs et décentralisés au maximum. Pour y parvenir, deux propriétés fondamentales doivent être contrôlées.\n\n### 1. Exigences matérielles\n\nLa décentralisation d'un réseau blockchain est déterminé par la capacité du nœud le plus faible du réseau à vérifier la blockchain et à en conserver l'état. Par conséquent, les coûts de fonctionnement d'un nœud (matériel, bande passante et stockage) doivent être maintenus aussi bas que possible afin de permettre à un maximum d'individus de devenir des participants permissionless au réseau trustless.\n\n### 2. Croissance de l'État\n\nLa croissance de l'état (state growth) fait référence à la vitesse de croissance de la blockchain. Plus le débit d'une blockchain est élevé par unité de temps, plus la blockchain se développe rapidement. Les nœuds complets stockent l'historique du réseau, et ils doivent être en mesure de valider l'état du réseau. L'état d'Ethereum est stocké et référencé à l'aide de structures efficaces telles que des arbres ([arbre de Merkle](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbre_de_Merkle)). Au fur et à mesure que l'état se développe, de nouvelles feuilles et branches sont ajoutées, ce qui rend l'exécution de certaines actions toujours plus complexe et plus longue. Au fur et à mesure que la blockchain s'agrandit, elle empire l’exécution par les nœuds dans le pire des cas, ce qui entraîne un temps toujours plus long pour valider les nouveaux blocs. Au fil du temps, cela augmente également le temps total nécessaire à la synchronisation d'un nœud complet.\n\n## Impacts néfastes de l'augmentation du débit\n\n### 1. Nombre de nœuds\n\nLes exigences minimales pour faire fonctionner un nœud et le nombre de nœuds sont les suivants :\n\n* Bitcoin¹ : 350 Go d'espace disque, connexion 5 Mbit/s, 1 Go de RAM, CPU >1 Ghz. **Nombre de nœuds : \\~10 000**\n* Ethereum² : 500GB+ espace disque SSD, connexion 25 Mbit/s, 4-8GB RAM, CPU 2-4 cores. **Nombre de nœuds : \\~6 000**\n* Solana³ : 1,5 To+ d'espace disque SSD, connexion 300 Mbit/s, 128 Go de RAM, CPU 12+ cœurs. **Nombre de nœuds : \\~1 200**\n\nNotez que plus les exigences en matière de CPU, de bande passante et de stockage pour les nœuds nécessaires au débit d'une blockchain sont élevées, moins il y a de nœuds sur le réseau, ce qui entraîne une décentralisation plus faible et un réseau moins inclusif.\n\n### 2. Temps de synchronisation d'un nœud complet\n\nLorsqu'un nœud fonctionne pour la première fois, il doit se synchroniser avec tous les nœuds existants, télécharger et valider l'état du réseau depuis le bloc de genèse jusqu'à l'extrémité de la chaîne. Ce processus doit être aussi rapide et efficace que possible pour permettre à quiconque d'agir en tant que participant permissionless du protocole.\n\nEn prenant comme indicateur les tests de synchronisation des [nœuds Bitcoin 2020](https://blog.lopp.net/2020-bitcoin-node-performance-tests/) et [2021](https://blog.lopp.net/2021-altcoin-node-sync-tests/) de Jameson Lopp, le tableau 1 compare le temps nécessaire à la synchronisation d'un nœud complet de Bitcoin, d'Ethereum et de Solana sur un PC grand public moyen.\n\n![Tableau 1. Comparaison du débit de la blockchain et de la synchronisation des nœuds](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S0FjQNLqB60bURgiddwGb.png?height=450&width=1400)\n\nLe tableau 1 montre que l'augmentation du débit entraîne des temps de synchronisation plus longs, car de plus en plus de données doivent être traitées et stockées.\n\nBien que des améliorations soient constamment apportées au logiciel des nœuds pour atténuer le défi posé par la croissance de la blockchain (réduction de l'empreinte du disque, vitesses de synchronisation plus rapides, meilleure résistance aux pannes, modularisation de certains composants, etc.\n\n### Comment définir la scalabilité ?\n\nLa scalabilité est le terme le plus mal représenté dans l'espace blockchain. Si l'augmentation du débit est souhaitable, elle n'est qu'une partie du puzzle.\n\n***La scalabilité*** *signifie* ***plus de transactions*** pour le ***même matériel***.\n\nPour cette raison, la scalabilité peut être séparée en deux catégories.\n\n### La scalabilité du séquenceur\n\nLe séquençage décrit l'acte d'ordonner et de traiter les transactions dans un réseau. Comme il a été établi précédemment, toute blockchain pourrait trivialement augmenter son débit en augmentant la taille des blocs et en raccourcissant leur durée jusqu'à un point où l'impact négatif sur sa décentralisation est jugé trop important. Mais le fait d'ajuster ces simples paramètres ne permet pas d'obtenir les améliorations nécessaires. L'EVM d'Ethereum peut, en théorie, [gérer jusqu'à environ 2 000 TPS](https://twitter.com/dankrad/status/1459607325854121989), ce qui est insuffisant pour répondre à la demande d'espace de bloc à long terme. Pour mettre à l'échelle le séquençage, Solana a fait quelques innovations impressionnantes : tirer parti d'un environnement d'exécution parallélisable et d'un mécanisme de consensus astucieux, qui permet un débit bien plus efficace. Mais, malgré ses améliorations, il n'est ni suffisant ni évolutif. À mesure que Solana augmente son débit, les coûts matériels pour faire fonctionner un nœud et traiter les transactions augmentent également.\n\n### Scalabilité de la vérification\n\nLa scalabilité de la vérification décrit des approches qui augmentent le débit sans imposer aux nœuds des coûts matériels toujours plus élevés. Plus précisément, elle fait référence aux innovations cryptographiques telles que les preuves de validité. Elles sont la raison pour laquelle les Validity Rollups peuvent faire évoluer une blockchain de manière durable.\n\n### **Qu'est-ce qu'un Validity Rollup ?**\n\nLes Validity Rollups (également connus sous le nom de \"ZK-Rollups\") déplacent le calcul et le stockage d'état off-chain mais conservent une petite quantité de certaines données on-chain. Un smart contract sur la blockchain sous-jacente maintient la racine de l'état du Rollup. Sur le Rollup, un lot de transactions hautement compressées, ainsi que la racine de l'état actuel, sont envoyés à un Prouveur off-chain. Le Prouveur calcule les transactions, génère une preuve de validité des résultats et de la nouvelle racine d'état, et l'envoie à un Verifieur on-chain. Le vérifieur vérifie la preuve de validité et le smart contract qui maintient l'état du rollup, le met à jour avec le nouvel état fourni par le vérifieur.\n\n### **Comment les Validity Rollup évoluent-ils avec les mêmes exigences matérielles ?**\n\nMême si les Prouveurs nécessitent du matériel haut de gamme, ils n'ont pas d'impact sur la décentralisation d'une blockchain, car la validité des transactions est garantie par des preuves mathématiquement vérifiables.\n\nCe qui importe, ce sont les exigences pour vérifier les preuves. Comme les données impliquées sont hautement compressées et largement abstraites par le calcul, leur impact sur les nœuds de la blockchain sous-jacente est minime.\n\nLes vérifieurs (nœuds Ethereum) n'ont pas besoin de matériel haut de gamme, et la taille des lots n'augmente pas les exigences matérielles. Seules les transitions d'état et une petite quantité de données d'appel doivent être traitées et stockées par les nœuds. Cela permet à tous les nœuds Ethereum de vérifier les lots Validity Rollup en utilisant leur matériel existant.\n\n### **Plus il y a de transactions, moins c'est cher**\n\nDans les blockchains traditionnelles, plus il y a de transactions, plus le coût est élevé pour tout le monde, car l'espace du bloc se remplit et les utilisateurs doivent surenchérir sur le marché des frais pour que leurs transactions soient incluses.\n\nPour un Validity Rollup, cette dynamique est inversée. La vérification d'un lot de transactions sur Ethereum a un certain coût. Au fur et à mesure que le nombre de transactions dans un lot augmente, le coût de vérification du lot augmente à un rythme exponentiellement plus lent. L'ajout d'un plus grand nombre de transactions à un lot entraîne des frais de transaction moins élevés, même si le coût de vérification du lot augmente, car il est amorti sur toutes les transactions du lot. Les modules d'extension de validité veulent qu'un lot contienne le plus grand nombre possible de transactions, afin que les frais de vérification puissent être répartis entre tous les utilisateurs. Au fur et à mesure que la taille du lot augmente jusqu'à l'infini, les frais amortis par transaction convergent vers zéro, c'est-à-dire que plus il y a de transactions dans un Validity Rollup, moins c'est cher pour tout le monde.\n\ndYdX, une dApp alimentée par un Validity Rollup, voit fréquemment des lots de plus de 12 000 transactions. La comparaison de la consommation de gas des mêmes transactions sur le Mainnet et sur un Validity Rollup illustre les gains de scalabilité :\n\nRèglement d'une transaction dYdX sur Ethereum Mainnet : **200 000 gas**\n\nRèglement d'une transaction dYdX sur StarkEx : <**500 gas**\n\nUne autre façon de voir les choses : Le coût principal des Validity Rollups évolue linéairement avec le nombre d'utilisateurs d'un même lot.\n\n### **Pourquoi les Optimistic Rollups ne sont pas aussi scalable qu'on pourrait le penser ?**\n\nEn théorie, les Optimistic Rollups offrent presque les mêmes avantages de scalabilité que les validity rollups. Mais il existe une distinction importante : Les Optimistic Rollups sont optimisés pour le cas moyen, alors que les Validity Rollups sont optimisés pour le cas le plus défavorable.

Ainsi, pour contester une fraude, l'utilisateur doit synchroniser un nœud complet Ethereum, un nœud complet L2, et calculer lui-même la transaction suspecte.\n\nDans le pire des cas, un utilisateur n'aurait qu'à synchroniser un nœud complet Ethereum pour vérifier la preuve de validité, s'épargnant ainsi la charge de calcul.\n\nContrairement aux Validity Rollups, le coût des Optimistic Rollups s'échelonne linéairement avec le nombre de transactions au lieu du nombre d'utilisateurs, ce qui les rend plus chers.\n\n### **Dernière pièce du puzzle - Accès permissionless à l'état du rollup**\n\nPour garantir la validité des transactions, les utilisateurs doivent exécuter un nœud Ethereum uniquement. Cependant, les utilisateurs et les développeurs peuvent vouloir voir, et exécuter, l'état et l'exécution du Rollup à diverses fins. Un nœud L2 d'indexation répond parfaitement à ce besoin. Non seulement il permet aux utilisateurs de voir les transactions dans le réseau, mais il s'agit également d'une pièce essentielle nécessaire au fonctionnement de l'infrastructure de l'écosystème. Les indexeurs comme The Graph, Alchemy, Infura, les réseaux Oracle comme Chainlink, et les explorateurs de blocs, tous sont entièrement pris en charge par un nœud L2 d'indexation permissionless.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDe nombreuses approches pour aborder la scalabilité des blockchains se concentrent à tort sur l'augmentation du débit.

The money circle leaders suffered heavy losses, and the maximum value decreased by nearly 90%", "body": "Cryptocurrency is still being sold, and bitcoin has fallen to its lowest level since December 2020.\n\nMarket data show that bitcoin has fallen for seven consecutive days - the longest consecutive decline since March 2020. On May 12, bitcoin fell below US $27000 / piece again, and other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum could not hide the decline. It fell 13% to less than US $1800 / piece, continuing to brush the new low since July last year. Ethereum fell 19.6% in 24 hours. As of press time, Ethereum has fallen by more than 16% to US $1770 / piece.\n\nIn fact, analysts have always regarded $30000 as an important milestone of bitcoin, and many people expect that once it falls below, its decline may accelerate. Technical analysts said bitcoin now needs to hold the $28000 mark, which could trigger a new wave of selling.\n\nRecently, the US stock market has continued to plummet. Some analysts believe that as traditional funds such as hedge funds and family trusts have entered the field of cryptocurrency in the past two years, digital assets have developed more and more synchronously with stocks. Such funds are more likely to sell cryptocurrency assets during market fluctuations.\n\nAt the same time, cryptocurrency has also been hit by the decoupling of stable currency. The stable currency was originally regarded as the least volatile currency in the cryptocurrency world, linked to the value of the currency issued by the government. However, in the past week, ust was decoupled from the US dollar exchange rate twice. The lowest value of UST, which was supposed to be the anchor of US $1, fell to US $0.65, triggering a crisis of confidence and impacting the overall cryptocurrency market.\n\nPreviously, the sister token Luna of ust was once called “coin circle Maotai” by coin circle players. It soared from the lowest point of US $0.12 to US $119.5, with a maximum market value of US $41 billion (about more than 270 billion yuan). Recently, its price once fell below US $2 and its market value once fell to US $1.1 billion.\n\nAccording to the data of on-line masters under okcloud chain, up to now, 43 companies or institutions, including gray-scale investment, hold 1225600 bitcoins. More than $13 billion of bitcoin held by institutions and companies including Tesla has evaporated. Among them, Aker ASA lost US $21.62 million, metu lost US $19.75 million and plunwra lost US $16.95 million, ranking in the top three. In addition, Tesla holds 40900 bitcoins, with an average price of $32000.\n\nAt the same time, the value of investment leaders has also shrunk due to the recent sharp decline. According to the Bloomberg billionaire index, the personal wealth of coinbase founder Brian Armstrong was $13.7 billion in November last year. So far, his wealth has evaporated by about 83% to $2.3 billion.\n\nCHANGPENG Zhao, chief executive of coin security, suffered more losses than Armstrong. According to the Bloomberg billionaire index in January, Zhao CHANGPENG’s personal wealth was $96 billion, which had been reduced to $11.6 billion as of May 11, with an evaporation rate of nearly 90%.", "timestamp": 1653240790, "digest": "URcFj5oYwpD6ozNBQkZu2SIHPlr-d5wYDqokFQHsLRo", "contributor": "0x50BbaEA569F29abd3c0d95e75A09E4f1876c98E4"}

{"id": "_JlEEPEaYZYjnl5-Gd_UL4q6sI3g6HDVEUh7t-HQRTA", "title": "On Nowness and Collective Memory", "body": "> “It is obvious to everybody that the phenomena of the world are evidently irreversible. I mean things happen that do not happen the other way. You drop a cup and it breaks, and you can sit there a long time waiting for the pieces to come together and jump back into your hand. If you watch the waves of the sea breaking, you can stand there and wait for the great moment when the foam collects together, rises up out of the sea, and falls back farther out from the shore — it would be very pretty!” - Richard Feynman\n\nWe all have an immediate, almost visceral understanding of the distinction between the past and the future, even from the most mundane experiences. We learn from the past, and we plan for the future. We celebrate, we commemorate, we mourn, and we hope. Yet, as Feynman notes, no one would sit and wait after a long enough time for the cup to come back together.\n\nBut although we so clearly understand the distinction between past and future so many of us spend surprisingly little time thinking about the present - the way we cultivate it and the way we become inspired by it. The more I think about it the more surprising this is, since in a sense there is no period quite so long as right now.\n\nMore than anything else this is because *now* is such a slippery concept in the first place. On the one hand, there is a standard notion of *nowness* we’re all naturally in tune with as we check our calendars, our watches, and our phones. On the other, there’s the time we truly *experience*. In ancient Greek, the distinction between kronos (*chronological, measured time*) and [kairos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairos) (*qualitative, lived time*) helped us better understand what we mean by the present moment. Similarly, in Sanskrit, *[ritu](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/ritu#sanskrit)* played a key cultural (and often spiritual) role marking meaningful moments of change.\n\nIn the current day, especially in light of the pandemic, our attention has slowly returned to the concept of lived time as a [subject of analysis](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/how-the-coronavirus-pandemic-is-warping-our-sense-of-time). As we all experienced time dilation together, it became more relevant, and in some ways easier for us to pinpoint just how much of an impact new experiences (and hence new memories) can have on our ability to move from one moment to the next.\n\n## Rhythm, Ritual, and Collective Memory\n\nIn every era the way we each individually interpret time comes with collective consequences. As the origins of words like kairos and ritu suggest, there has always been a sense of life and ripeness that comes with a change in environment, and with new experiences.\n\nSimultaneously, there is a sense of punctuation that comes with *ritual* which guides our ability to recollect our collective memory. Rituals are intentional, repeated moments with others or even with ourselves, which somehow, incredibly, cleanse our spirits and create a renewed sense of novelty (and alter our sense of time). But the types of rituals we take part in have changed extensively over time, with the rise and fall variations of social, political, theological / ecclesiastic tradition, and perhaps most importantly with the rise of new technologies.\n\nThese times of change in ritual haven’t been left unexplored. The ethnographer Arnold van Gennep, anthropologist Victor Turner, and even the psychologist Carl Jung all touched on the notion of liminal phases in which changes in rituals and customs occur – another kind of collective present. Today, people might like to call these changes [vibe shifts](https://www.thecut.com/2022/02/a-vibe-shift-is-coming.html).\n\nWith the ever increasing pace of technology, these shifts are occurring faster than ever. With the introduction of the [printing press](https://fs.blog/memory-printing-press/), we moved from spoken words held in memory to books as the main store of human knowledge.\n\nAs Marshall McLuhan noted, computers, connected via the internet, have further complicated the way we remember and the way we flow through time. Especially in the modern day, we’re constantly bouncing between algorithmically generated and distributed narratives that lack the same weight, the same auras as those that we collectively imagined together.\n\nIt’s no surprise then that the idea of [lore](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1503415155975204864) has resurfaced. But perhaps the most important questions remain unasked: namely, what actions can we take to collectively maintain it?\n\nThere are many answers to this question, and I’m not even certain there’s a right one, but it certainly feels like we need new forms of ritual that we can enact together to draw ourselves back to [intentionality](https://scott.mirror.xyz/U8aWHSX_HHHYcN1GvbTcBnZbAR7eNeJ_61WIOuSguF8); to regain a sense of focus and in turn a sense of true belonging.\n\nExploring these rituals, however, can’t be done in writing. It can’t be done between a writer and an audience. It has to be done together.\n\n*Thanks as always to Andy Tudhope, David Phelps, and Vivek Singh for graciously reviewing this draft. Please note, this draft will likely change over time as I update my thinking and continue to add more depth and context.

Presque tous les réseaux blockchain vantent le nombre élevé de transactions par seconde (TPS) comme un argument de vente. Cependant, le TPS n'est pas une mesure valable pour comparer les réseaux blockchain, ce qui rend difficile l'évaluation de leurs performances relatives. De plus, les grands nombres de TPS ont généralement un coût, ce qui pose la question suivante : ces réseaux sont-ils réellement évolutifs ou se contentent-ils d'augmenter leur débit ?\n\nExaminons donc comment définir la scalabilité, quels compromis sont faits pour y parvenir et pourquoi les Validity Rollups constituent la solution la scalabilité par excellence.\n\n### Toutes les transactions ne sont pas égales\n\nTout d'abord, nous devons établir notre affirmation selon laquelle la mesure simple et pratique des TPS ne sont pas une mesure précise de la scalabilité.\n\nPour compenser les nœuds pour l'exécution des transactions (et pour dissuader les utilisateurs de spammer le réseau avec des calculs inutiles), les blockchains facturent des frais proportionnels à la charge de calcul imposée à la blockchain. Dans Ethereum, la complexité de la charge de calcul est mesurée en gas. Le gas étant une mesure très pratique de la complexité des transactions, le terme sera utilisé tout au long de cet article pour les blockchains autres qu'Ethereum, même s'il est généralement spécifique à Ethereum.\n\nLes transactions diffèrent considérablement en termes de complexité et, par conséquent, de quantité de gas qu'elles consomment. Bitcoin, le pionnier des transactions de pair à pair (P2P) trustless, ne prend en charge que le rudimentaire script Bitcoin. Ces simples transferts d'adresse à adresse consomment peu de gas. En revanche, les chaînes de smart contract comme Ethereum ou Solana prennent en charge une machine virtuelle et des langages de programmation complets de Turing qui permettent des transactions beaucoup plus complexes. Par conséquent, les dApps comme Uniswap nécessitent beaucoup plus de gas.\n\nC'est pourquoi il est absurde de comparer les TPS de différentes blockchains. Ce que nous devrions plutôt comparer, c'est la capacité de calcul ou débit.\n\nToutes les blockchains ont une taille de bloc (variable) et un temps de bloc qui déterminent combien d'unités de calcul peuvent être traitées par bloc et à quelle vitesse un nouveau bloc peut être ajouté. Ensemble, ces deux variables déterminent le débit d'une blockchain.\n\n## Qu'est-ce qui limite la scalabilité ?\n\nLes blockchains s'efforcent d'être des réseaux inclusifs et décentralisés au maximum. Pour y parvenir, deux propriétés fondamentales doivent être contrôlées.\n\n### 1. Exigences matérielles\n\nLa décentralisation d'un réseau blockchain est déterminé par la capacité du nœud le plus faible du réseau à vérifier la blockchain et à en conserver l'état. Par conséquent, les coûts de fonctionnement d'un nœud (matériel, bande passante et stockage) doivent être maintenus aussi bas que possible afin de permettre à un maximum d'individus de devenir des participants permissionless au réseau trustless.\n\n### 2. Croissance de l'État\n\nLa croissance de l'état (state growth) fait référence à la vitesse de croissance de la blockchain. Plus le débit d'une blockchain est élevé par unité de temps, plus la blockchain se développe rapidement. Les nœuds complets stockent l'historique du réseau, et ils doivent être en mesure de valider l'état du réseau. L'état d'Ethereum est stocké et référencé à l'aide de structures efficaces telles que des arbres ([arbre de Merkle](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbre_de_Merkle)). Au fur et à mesure que l'état se développe, de nouvelles feuilles et branches sont ajoutées, ce qui rend l'exécution de certaines actions toujours plus complexe et plus longue. Au fur et à mesure que la blockchain s'agrandit, elle empire l’exécution par les nœuds dans le pire des cas, ce qui entraîne un temps toujours plus long pour valider les nouveaux blocs. Au fil du temps, cela augmente également le temps total nécessaire à la synchronisation d'un nœud complet.\n\n## Impacts néfastes de l'augmentation du débit\n\n### 1. Nombre de nœuds\n\nLes exigences minimales pour faire fonctionner un nœud et le nombre de nœuds sont les suivants :\n\n* Bitcoin¹ : 350 Go d'espace disque, connexion 5 Mbit/s, 1 Go de RAM, CPU >1 Ghz. **Nombre de nœuds : \\~10 000**\n* Ethereum² : 500GB+ espace disque SSD, connexion 25 Mbit/s, 4-8GB RAM, CPU 2-4 cores. **Nombre de nœuds : \\~6 000**\n* Solana³ : 1,5 To+ d'espace disque SSD, connexion 300 Mbit/s, 128 Go de RAM, CPU 12+ cœurs. **Nombre de nœuds : \\~1 200**\n\nNotez que plus les exigences en matière de CPU, de bande passante et de stockage pour les nœuds nécessaires au débit d'une blockchain sont élevées, moins il y a de nœuds sur le réseau, ce qui entraîne une décentralisation plus faible et un réseau moins inclusif.\n\n### 2. Temps de synchronisation d'un nœud complet\n\nLorsqu'un nœud fonctionne pour la première fois, il doit se synchroniser avec tous les nœuds existants, télécharger et valider l'état du réseau depuis le bloc de genèse jusqu'à l'extrémité de la chaîne. Ce processus doit être aussi rapide et efficace que possible pour permettre à quiconque d'agir en tant que participant permissionless du protocole.\n\nEn prenant comme indicateur les tests de synchronisation des [nœuds Bitcoin 2020](https://blog.lopp.net/2020-bitcoin-node-performance-tests/) et [2021](https://blog.lopp.net/2021-altcoin-node-sync-tests/) de Jameson Lopp, le tableau 1 compare le temps nécessaire à la synchronisation d'un nœud complet de Bitcoin, d'Ethereum et de Solana sur un PC grand public moyen.\n\n![Tableau 1. Comparaison du débit de la blockchain et de la synchronisation des nœuds](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S0FjQNLqB60bURgiddwGb.png?height=450&width=1400)\n\nLe tableau 1 montre que l'augmentation du débit entraîne des temps de synchronisation plus longs, car de plus en plus de données doivent être traitées et stockées.\n\nBien que des améliorations soient constamment apportées au logiciel des nœuds pour atténuer le défi posé par la croissance de la blockchain (réduction de l'empreinte du disque, vitesses de synchronisation plus rapides, meilleure résistance aux pannes, modularisation de certains composants, etc.\n\n### Comment définir la scalabilité ?\n\nLa scalabilité est le terme le plus mal représenté dans l'espace blockchain. Si l'augmentation du débit est souhaitable, elle n'est qu'une partie du puzzle.\n\n***La scalabilité*** *signifie* ***plus de transactions*** pour le ***même matériel***.\n\nPour cette raison, la scalabilité peut être séparée en deux catégories.\n\n### La scalabilité du séquenceur\n\nLe séquençage décrit l'acte d'ordonner et de traiter les transactions dans un réseau. Comme il a été établi précédemment, toute blockchain pourrait trivialement augmenter son débit en augmentant la taille des blocs et en raccourcissant leur durée jusqu'à un point où l'impact négatif sur sa décentralisation est jugé trop important. Mais le fait d'ajuster ces simples paramètres ne permet pas d'obtenir les améliorations nécessaires. L'EVM d'Ethereum peut, en théorie, [gérer jusqu'à environ 2 000 TPS](https://twitter.com/dankrad/status/1459607325854121989), ce qui est insuffisant pour répondre à la demande d'espace de bloc à long terme. Pour mettre à l'échelle le séquençage, Solana a fait quelques innovations impressionnantes : tirer parti d'un environnement d'exécution parallélisable et d'un mécanisme de consensus astucieux, qui permet un débit bien plus efficace. Mais, malgré ses améliorations, il n'est ni suffisant ni évolutif. À mesure que Solana augmente son débit, les coûts matériels pour faire fonctionner un nœud et traiter les transactions augmentent également.\n\n### Scalabilité de la vérification\n\nLa scalabilité de la vérification décrit des approches qui augmentent le débit sans imposer aux nœuds des coûts matériels toujours plus élevés. Plus précisément, elle fait référence aux innovations cryptographiques telles que les preuves de validité. Elles sont la raison pour laquelle les Validity Rollups peuvent faire évoluer une blockchain de manière durable.\n\n### **Qu'est-ce qu'un Validity Rollup ?**\n\nLes Validity Rollups (également connus sous le nom de \"ZK-Rollups\") déplacent le calcul et le stockage d'état off-chain mais conservent une petite quantité de certaines données on-chain. Un smart contract sur la blockchain sous-jacente maintient la racine de l'état du Rollup. Sur le Rollup, un lot de transactions hautement compressées, ainsi que la racine de l'état actuel, sont envoyés à un Prouveur off-chain. Le Prouveur calcule les transactions, génère une preuve de validité des résultats et de la nouvelle racine d'état, et l'envoie à un Verifieur on-chain. Le vérifieur vérifie la preuve de validité et le smart contract qui maintient l'état du rollup, le met à jour avec le nouvel état fourni par le vérifieur.\n\n### **Comment les Validity Rollup évoluent-ils avec les mêmes exigences matérielles ?**\n\nMême si les Prouveurs nécessitent du matériel haut de gamme, ils n'ont pas d'impact sur la décentralisation d'une blockchain, car la validité des transactions est garantie par des preuves mathématiquement vérifiables.\n\nCe qui importe, ce sont les exigences pour vérifier les preuves. Comme les données impliquées sont hautement compressées et largement abstraites par le calcul, leur impact sur les nœuds de la blockchain sous-jacente est minime.\n\nLes vérifieurs (nœuds Ethereum) n'ont pas besoin de matériel haut de gamme, et la taille des lots n'augmente pas les exigences matérielles. Seules les transitions d'état et une petite quantité de données d'appel doivent être traitées et stockées par les nœuds. Cela permet à tous les nœuds Ethereum de vérifier les lots Validity Rollup en utilisant leur matériel existant.\n\n### **Plus il y a de transactions, moins c'est cher**\n\nDans les blockchains traditionnelles, plus il y a de transactions, plus le coût est élevé pour tout le monde, car l'espace du bloc se remplit et les utilisateurs doivent surenchérir sur le marché des frais pour que leurs transactions soient incluses.\n\nPour un Validity Rollup, cette dynamique est inversée. La vérification d'un lot de transactions sur Ethereum a un certain coût. Au fur et à mesure que le nombre de transactions dans un lot augmente, le coût de vérification du lot augmente à un rythme exponentiellement plus lent. L'ajout d'un plus grand nombre de transactions à un lot entraîne des frais de transaction moins élevés, même si le coût de vérification du lot augmente, car il est amorti sur toutes les transactions du lot. Les modules d'extension de validité veulent qu'un lot contienne le plus grand nombre possible de transactions, afin que les frais de vérification puissent être répartis entre tous les utilisateurs. Au fur et à mesure que la taille du lot augmente jusqu'à l'infini, les frais amortis par transaction convergent vers zéro, c'est-à-dire que plus il y a de transactions dans un Validity Rollup, moins c'est cher pour tout le monde.\n\ndYdX, une dApp alimentée par un Validity Rollup, voit fréquemment des lots de plus de 12 000 transactions. La comparaison de la consommation de gas des mêmes transactions sur le Mainnet et sur un Validity Rollup illustre les gains de scalabilité :\n\nRèglement d'une transaction dYdX sur Ethereum Mainnet : **200 000 gas**\n\nRèglement d'une transaction dYdX sur StarkEx : <**500 gas**\n\nUne autre façon de voir les choses : Le coût principal des Validity Rollups évolue linéairement avec le nombre d'utilisateurs d'un même lot.\n\n### **Pourquoi les Optimistic Rollups ne sont pas aussi scalable qu'on pourrait le penser ?**\n\nEn théorie, les Optimistic Rollups offrent presque les mêmes avantages de scalabilité que les validity rollups. Mais il existe une distinction importante : Les Optimistic Rollups sont optimisés pour le cas moyen, alors que les Validity Rollups sont optimisés pour le cas le plus défavorable. Les systèmes de blockchain fonctionnant dans des conditions extrêmement défavorables, l'optimisation pour le pire des cas est le seul moyen d'assurer la sécurité.\n\nDans le pire cas du **Optimistic Rollups,** les transactions d'un utilisateur ne seront pas vérifiées par les contrôleurs de fraude. Ainsi, pour contester une fraude, l'utilisateur doit synchroniser un nœud complet Ethereum, un nœud complet L2, et calculer lui-même la transaction suspecte.\n\nDans le pire des cas, un utilisateur n'aurait qu'à synchroniser un nœud complet Ethereum pour vérifier la preuve de validité, s'épargnant ainsi la charge de calcul.\n\nContrairement aux Validity Rollups, le coût des Optimistic Rollups s'échelonne linéairement avec le nombre de transactions au lieu du nombre d'utilisateurs, ce qui les rend plus chers.\n\n### **Dernière pièce du puzzle - Accès permissionless à l'état du rollup**\n\nPour garantir la validité des transactions, les utilisateurs doivent exécuter un nœud Ethereum uniquement. Cependant, les utilisateurs et les développeurs peuvent vouloir voir, et exécuter, l'état et l'exécution du Rollup à diverses fins. Un nœud L2 d'indexation répond parfaitement à ce besoin. Non seulement il permet aux utilisateurs de voir les transactions dans le réseau, mais il s'agit également d'une pièce essentielle nécessaire au fonctionnement de l'infrastructure de l'écosystème. Les indexeurs comme The Graph, Alchemy, Infura, les réseaux Oracle comme Chainlink, et les explorateurs de blocs, tous sont entièrement pris en charge par un nœud L2 d'indexation permissionless.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDe nombreuses approches pour aborder la scalabilité des blockchains se concentrent à tort sur l'augmentation du débit.

{"id": "rPBNfJQ1QAgTwWJsofVA7RXpd3zI1Z9Z64Nb5lmh4Qk", "title": "Can roast + complaining solve the problem? CBA signboards need to be jointly maintained", "body": "In the ninth round of CBA League, in a focus duel between Liaoning and Shanxi, the scores of the two teams have been completely opened in the second half, and the game has lost suspense early. However, Guo Allen, a player of Liaoning team, complained that the referee was expelled after an attack, which has become the focus of the game.\n\nAfter the game, Guo Allen directly made a comment on social media, “I can’t understand. It’s a joke. I’ll play games. Bye.”\n\nComments about referees and players spread all over the comment area. Soon after, the topic of “Guo Allen was expelled” rushed to the microblog hot search, and it still topped the list hot search this morning. It can be seen that everyone’s attention to this matter is far more than the game itself.\n\nFrom the perspective of slow motion, Aaron Guo’s layup was indeed suspected of being violated, but the referee could not guarantee that every penalty would be foolproof for other objective reasons such as angle on the court. We can only maximize the fairness of the players of the two teams, not to mention the uncertainty of competitive sports is also an attractive factor.\n\nOf course, Aaron Guo’s complaint has his reasons, but his improper speech directly led him to two consecutive technical fouls and was finally expelled. For Guo Allen, it’s natural that some dumb people have a hard feeling of eating Coptis chinensis. They themselves suffer a loss. They find the referee to reason, but they suffer again.\n\nAs a player, respect the rules and face up to the problems. Even if you suffer a loss on the court, you can go through the appeal channel and ask the relevant departments to watch the video. If you compete directly with the referee on the court, the irrational athlete will naturally become the object of punishment. He will be wronged himself, which will only make him more embarrassed.\n\nAfter Aaron Guo was expelled, I believe the CBA alliance will not turn a blind eye to his words on social media. According to the ticket issued by CBA League this season, Aaron Guo may be fined or even suspended.\n\nIn the match between Guangzhou and Jilin this week, Guangzhou head coach Guo Shiqiang was directly suspended for five games and fined 20000 yuan because he complained about the referee and made a scene on the technical stage. Zhao Rui was suspended for one match and fined 50000 yuan for judging with his fingers and using insulting language. These two tickets related to referees can be seen from a certain extent that the CBA alliance is protecting referees and strictly implementing the rules. Of course, the protection of referees is not biased. There are major omissions and misjudgments, and CBA also has a corresponding punishment mechanism for referees. For example, the referees and technical representatives of law enforcement Guangzhou and Jilin have been criticized internally, and there is even news that they have been suspended.\n\nAlthough referees often become the object of roast, people should communicate or appeal in appropriate ways. Blindly pushing the referee to the commanding height of public opinion will only make everyone watch the game with colored glasses and can’t appreciate the charm of competitive sports itself.\n\nOf course, the remarks made by Liaoning team head coach Yang Ming at the post game press conference are worth praising for him. As the coach of the team and the coach of Aaron Guo, he apologized to the outside world for his players in front of the media. “The only deficiency is that Allen apologized to everyone and the referee through the media lens. (Guo Allen) the team will summarize the complaints about the referee’s decision, and strive for the coaching team to master the field environment and the scale of the referee’s decision in the future, so as not to make similar mistakes.” Yang Ming’s remarks set a good example for the whole team and even the whole league.\n\nUnder the background of the epidemic, CBA League has always been forging ahead and continuing the closed management of the tournament system. It is very difficult for 20 teams, including the referees. When the CBA League is in trouble, we need to work together to maintain the image of the league. Superstars, CBA League and fans are duty bound to work together to overcome difficulties and create a better environment for the CBA League.", "timestamp": 1653241471, "digest": "MvchtL0K7JdHYg3PAiFK7SvGq73X2FUulwe2RNjuTzA", "contributor": "0x2eC42C830Ed1356983C3818DFf57B51C4b60bbe9"}
{"id": "3uEv8Ewj-PG7gJasmJ0aBy1LiK0YG2F2CL1BVDCPm1E", "title": "The auto market falls into recession, and the repair must grasp three key points", "body": "The supply chain crisis, accompanied by the conversion of popular models, jointly led to the decline of the car market in early 2022. After the market has identified the new hot spot of “new energy + economic models”, whether several star products can be born in the second quarter to stimulate the rapid recovery of the market has become the key to whether China’s auto market can maintain growth or at least avoid a serious recession in 2022.\n\nWen Yinlu editor mark\n\nThe passenger car market joint conference (hereinafter referred to as the passenger car Association), China Automobile Industry Association and China Automobile Circulation Association have successively released the key operation data of China’s automobile market in April 2022 in the past few days. The data performance is expected to be very depressed. In addition, more than expected, not only the production end is seriously damaged, but also the sales end data is obviously weak, and the production and sales ends are under pressure. The second quarter of this year has become a key window period for the repair of the automobile market.\n\nAfter in-depth communication with many OEMs and dealers, Caijing eleven believes that there are three key points to repair the car market:\n\n 1. Dredge the capillaries of the supply chain.\n 2. 2. It is urgent to bail out dealers.\n 3. 3. The integration of car enterprises follows the hot spot transformation of the car market.\n 4. Supply chain repair more difficult than expected\n 5. The impact of this round of epidemic on automobile production is comparable to that when the epidemic just broke out in 2020. According to the data released by the passenger Federation, 969000 passenger cars were produced in April, down 41.1% year-on-year and 46.8% month on month, which is under great pressure. The last time the monthly output of passenger cars was less than one million was in February and March 2020, 208000 and 975000 respectively.\n 6. The decline rates of production at different levels are as follows: luxury brands decreased by 57% year-on-year and 43% month on month; Joint venture brands decreased by 56% year-on-year and 58% month on month; Independent brands decreased by 20% year-on-year and 38% month on month. The biggest reason for the decline of joint venture brands is that many car companies are located in Shanghai and Changchun, which are seriously affected by the epidemic. In April, the production of five major automobile enterprises in Shanghai decreased by 75% month on month compared with March, the production of joint venture major automobile enterprises in Changchun decreased by 54% month on month, and the overall decline in other regions was 38%.\n 7. The supply chain crisis has led to more than one million production cuts. After entering may, although the situation has improved, the impact is still not optimistic. Changchun has basically completed the restoration of production order, but there are many difficulties in resuming production in Shanghai. The automobile supply chain is very long. It is difficult to cover all key enterprises in the supply chain through the permission of the white list.\n 8. Chen Yudong, President of Bosch China, said that although the two batches of white lists released in Shanghai have covered more than 2000 enterprises, and most of the first-class suppliers of Bosch and Bosch are in the “white list”, the suppliers of Bosch suppliers are not necessarily in the “white list”, and the supply chain cannot form a chain, so products cannot be produced in the end.\n 9. For example, Chen Yudong said, “we have a coating supplier. The company is in Shanghai and the scale is very small. In this case, it is difficult to resume work, but if the supplier does not resume work, it will affect the production of the whole chain. In the later stage, we also helped the company resume work through various coordination.”\n10. The madness of competing for upstream supply is also affecting the progress of resumption of production. At present, the supply capacity of upstream suppliers is very limited. When competing for the supply of goods, there are even buyers blocking the door with cash. As long as there are goods, the buyer will take care of them all. This gave birth to a phenomenon. One of the two enterprises grabbed part a and the other grabbed Part B. as a result, the two enterprises didn’t spend less money, but the parts were still incomplete and could not resume production smoothly.\n11. Logistics and accessories are the two major problems faced by the current auto enterprises. If these problems are not solved, even if the workers can return to their posts smoothly, they will face the situation of no work to start. From April 18 to the end of the month, there are 11 working days. SAIC passenger car port base produced more than 2400 vehicles in April and Tesla produced 10757 vehicles in April, both of which are less than half of the normal production capacity. Chen Yudong also confirmed that although Bosch’s factories are in production and operation, the degree of capacity recovery is not optimistic. On the whole, the degree of capacity recovery is about 30% - 75%.\n12. Although the repair road of the whole automobile supply chain is blocked and long, the trend is obviously improving. Cui Dongshu, Secretary General of the Federation, revealed at the sales data release and communication meeting on May 10 that the delivery data in the first week of May had been significantly improved compared with the last week of April. With the continuous improvement of epidemic control in Shanghai, the repair of supply chain will be significantly accelerated. At present, compared with the difficulties of vehicle manufacturers, the plight of dealers in direct contact with consumers needs more attention.\n13. Dealers are more difficult than vehicle manufacturers\n14. The difficulties of vehicle manufacturers have become the focus of the whole society, but the difficulties of dealers have not been paid enough attention. According to the data released by China Automobile Circulation Association, among the 94 City samples surveyed, dealers in 34 cities have closed their stores due to epidemic prevention and control, mostly in first tier cities. More than 60% of the dealers who closed their stores for more than a week. Most dealers said they could not complete the sales task of the current month. More than 70% of dealers with a completion rate of less than 70% and more than 40% of dealers with a completion rate of less than half. At present, some car enterprises have reduced the task assessment indicators for dealers.\n15. Key data reflect the severity of the problem. At present, the dealer’s inventory coefficient (inventory coefficient = ending inventory / current sales volume) is 1.91, which is the highest value since March 2020. From February to April this year, the inventory coefficients are 1.85, 1.75 and 1.91 respectively, significantly exceeding the boom and bust line of 1.50, and increasing year-on-year for three consecutive months.\n16. Source: China Automobile Circulation Association\n17. According to the analysis of the passenger Association, the proportion of in transit inventory has increased, and the production of some popular models is in shortage, resulting in the mismatch of supply and demand structure and great difficulty in adjustment; The lack of retail increment of popular models also makes the inventory coefficient falsely high.\n18. However, the false high coefficient does not mean that the damage to dealers is false. The dealer inventory early warning index released by China Automobile Circulation Association in April was 66.4%, while the rise and fall line of this index was 50%. The early warning index in April was the highest value since February 2020, and the early warning index has risen continuously since February 2022. Unlike the inventory coefficient, which only calculates a single index, the early warning index integrates the total demand of the automobile market, the customer volume of 4S stores, the transaction rate, price changes and sales changes\n19.

The community can create any World that can be prototyped.**\n\nThe idea that web3 can inform the design of a better tomorrow, and that the Web3 community is a disrupting force that can provoke better societies into existence is a powerful one to explore, envision, and question. If proven true then it is a movement.\n\n**Web3 systems can provoke themselves into existence**\n\n\"Web3 has stunned the world by forging a parallel system of finance of unprecedented flexibility and creativity in less than a decade.\" This demonstrates that within the online bubble of the internet \"Web3 systems can provoke themselves into existence\". This is largely true because social consensus and economic incentives are embedded into their design and enforced at deployment. \n\n**Can we design and build cyber-physical systems to capitalize on the promise of Web3 and provoke a better future?**\n\nThis promising transformational power, if indeed exists, remains unused in large-scale constructs that bridge the cyber and physical worlds such as private cities, because it is too complex and daunting for anyone to tackle alone. \n\nIn one aspect this is because web3 technology is a stack of abstract protocols that makes it very difficult for technical and non-technical users to imagine future realities and alternative worlds that may become available to us by hierarchical assemblies of lego-code blocks. \n\n**Is there a need for a decentralized agency to design, research, and prototype future realities?**\n\nIn this era of unprecedented change, no single team or organization can begin to design unexpected solutions that disrupt conventional thinking without deep collaboration between ecosystem players, communities, and local governance. The fact that there is no easy way to imagine future worlds build with this futuristic technologies, the uncertainty, and other factors are limiting the potential of society to use Web3 in full force. As an example we bring the potential of a Web3 city of 5 M people that could generate an annual product of five hundred Million Ether the equivalent of one Trillion USD.\n\n**Why the Web3 community needs World Building Prototyping?**\n\nWeb3 Synthetic Worlds provides the opportunity for a unique and unparallel experimental environment to: design, prototype, and test complex \\[socio-economic and political \\] systems of regional scale. In doing so, they allow us to not just tinker with the status quo, but to dismantle it and build something better in its place. \n\nBy prototyping projective futures we can show people that other realities are possible and that web3 can help us get there. If we can show that web3 can help to create a brighter future and we map the path to it, many of us will all rush towards that outcome. \n\n**What kind of a decentralized design agency do we imagine?**\n\nThis design initiative finds it attractive to follow an approach modeled as an agency that works on behalf of the Web3 community and ecosystem to help envision the potential of Web3 to its fullest extent through prototyping new worlds that we haven't seen before. This d.agency, is coming together to work with the community to drive the future of Web3 and help put the community at the center of this movement. \n\nThe success of this experiment is based on our ability to create value for citizens and society. Providing a way to align incentives to attract participation and share the benefits of future outcomes is central to our vision for fairness and justice.\n\n\\[This is a draft, a living document.

This is because all hardware wallets that require signing of transactions would have to be compromised *simultaneously* in order for an attacker to steal the funds, which would be extremely hard to do if you use hardware wallets from different vendors.\n\n正如 Michael Flaxman 在此[播客](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/97/)中所提到的，多重簽名錢包中每增加一個簽名者，安全性就會提高一個等級，即使增加的簽名方是閉源硬件錢包。因為如果攻擊著想要攻擊一筆多簽交易，他就必須攻擊所有參與簽名的硬件錢包。如果您使用的是來自不同供應商的硬件錢包，那這種情況將難以實現。\n\n目前，我們以經完成了與 [Gnosis Safe](https://support.keyst.one/3rd-party-wallets/defi-dapp-with-keystone/gnosis-safe)、 [Blue Wallet](https://support.keyst.one/v/traditional-chinese/di-san-fang-qian-bao/bi-te-bi-qian-bao/bluewallet)、[Spectre](https://support.keyst.one/v/traditional-chinese/di-san-fang-qian-bao/bi-te-bi-qian-bao/specter)、[Wasabi Wallet](https://support.keyst.one/v/traditional-chinese/di-san-fang-qian-bao/bi-te-bi-qian-bao/wasabi)、[Sparrow](https://support.keyst.one/v/traditional-chinese/di-san-fang-qian-bao/bi-te-bi-qian-bao/sparrow)、[BTCPay Server](https://support.keyst.one/v/traditional-chinese/di-san-fang-qian-bao/bi-te-bi-qian-bao/btcpay-server)、[Electrum Wallet](https://support.keyst.one/v/traditional-chinese/di-san-fang-qian-bao/bi-te-bi-qian-bao/electrum)、Fully Noded 等多個數字貨幣錢包的兼容，並且支持 PSBT 多重簽名。多重簽名被認為是安全儲存數字貨幣的[最佳選擇](https://twitter.com/mflaxman/status/1310580116808970240)，用戶可以使用 Keystone 硬件錢包作為簽名者創建多重簽名錢包，以此驗證未簽名的多重簽名交易。您可以在[本文](https://medium.com/shiftcrypto/the-pitfalls-of-multisig-when-using-hardware-wallets-9b0e98e4c19c)中查看此功能的重要性。\n\n## 下一步計畫\n\n目前，為了防止網絡釣魚攻擊，Keystone 僅允許用戶通過簽名的固件包進行升級， Ledger、Trezor 和 Keepkey 用戶最近都成為網絡釣魚攻擊的受害者。所以只是單單提醒用戶謹慎安裝第三方固件不足以應對威脅，因為並非所有用戶都具備必要的背景知識，能意識到固件升級過程中潛在的網絡攻擊。\n\n僅允許由我們簽署的固件包進行升級確實防範了大量網絡攻擊，但也有缺點，那就是用戶必須信任我們發布的固件升級包。為了減小這種信任，並滿足那些想要自定義固件的高級用戶，我們未來會發布 Cypherpunk 版本的 Keystone，這個版本的 Keystone 不再預裝任何固件，因此用戶必須編譯自己的固件，在 Github 上選擇可用的私鑰進行簽名，並且，用戶可以自行替換升級包校驗的秘鑰對，從而只識別用戶自行簽名的升級包。\n\n作為目前區塊鏈社區中支持[多重簽名這一最佳解決方案](https://twitter.com/mflaxman/status/1310580116808970240)的一員，我們非常自豪地告訴大家，我們與 [Nunchuk](https://nunchuk.io/)、[ColdCard](https://coldcard.com/) 和 [BitBox](https://shiftcrypto.ch/) 的開發人員一起起草了 [BIP129](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0129.mediawiki)（比特幣安全多重簽名設置，BSMS ）。該 BIP 將比特幣多重簽名的安全性，提升到了一個全新的水平。不久的將來，我們也將實施此 BIP 準則。\n\n# 羅馬不是一天建成的\n\n關於開源，我們為什麼要一步一步實現？有這樣幾個原因。首先，我們有責任保護我們的用戶免受日益增加的黑客攻擊，而將代碼開源的同時也將暴露漏洞，行業內有一句話：「security through obscurity」。所以，Keystone 硬件錢包開源的同時也產生了新的潛在威脅。我們需要執行更嚴格的代碼標準，對這些漏洞進行分析修復，然後才能發布。\n\n世界上沒有絕對的事情，也沒有任何電子產品永遠是完全透明100%開源的，但開源對區塊鏈社區來說仍然非常重要。開源代碼不僅使內部工程師作惡變得更加困難，而且還能促進硬件錢包與軟件錢包等其他產品的集成。現在我們的產品與其他軟件錢包的兼容性越來越高，這也是我們理應為比特幣社區做出的貢獻，同時這也有助於減少用戶對我們產品的信任依賴。", "timestamp": 1653241826, "digest": "iLJF6Da4LgtnfdhIyWtNW67rEij1ld6pwxItNlN9_6w", "contributor": "0xaFEF3a80B6A205d1F74aaC7887e96A0F6F6051e0"}

Zhuang Guotai, Secretary of the Party group and director of the China Meteorological Administration, put forward clear requirements for strengthening meteorological disaster monitoring and early warning and cooperating with relevant departments to do a good job in disaster prevention and reduction. Yu Yong, member of the Party group and deputy director of the Bureau, deployed the next work.\n\nThe meeting pointed out that the China Meteorological Administration attached great importance to the strongest precipitation process in the South since the flood season. Local meteorological support services continued to follow up and took strong actions, showing a good trend of early prediction, early service, good linkage and good effect. Meteorological departments at all levels should implement the concept of “people first and life first”, continue to cooperate with relevant departments to do a good job, and earnestly build the first line of defense for meteorological disaster prevention and reduction.\n\nThe meeting made arrangements for the next work:\n\nFirst, we should strengthen monitoring, forecasting and early warning services. The heavy precipitation process is still continuing and is in the critical period of defense. Meteorological departments at all levels should continue to maintain the combat state, make persistent efforts, strengthen rolling monitoring, consultation, research and judgment, give full play to the advantages of modern meteorological monitoring means, strengthen short-term approach prediction, and go all out to provide monitoring and prediction services.\n\nSecond, service tips should be provided for possible subsequent secondary disasters. The precipitation lasts for a long time. We should pay close attention to the secondary disasters that may induce mountain torrents, geological disasters and other disasters, as well as the disaster risks such as over alarm of small and medium-sized rivers and waterlogging in urban and rural areas, and timely follow up and optimize the service tips.\n\nThird, we should continue to strengthen information submission and public science popularization. Fully understand the importance of all parties to the heavy precipitation process, timely and authoritative release of meteorological monitoring actual information and rolling forecast and early warning, strengthen close cooperation with relevant departments, timely report to Party committees and governments at all levels, timely inform the public and popularize science.\n\nFourth, we should make an overall plan for the current cold air in the north and heavy rainfall in the south. At present, the process of cold air in the north is extreme. In particular, it is necessary to strengthen the analysis of the impact of cold air on epidemic prevention and control and agricultural production, and provide targeted decision-making services by comparing historical data with big data. The South should beware of secondary disasters that may be induced by early precipitation accumulation.", "timestamp": 1653242336, "digest": "8tkoBLJtPE_0rze45uBwUt3Dz1EvGQ0Fic_Gzm4yThQ", "contributor": "0xeb948025a9113a2390E01a455Fda18B2D425254B"}

The big publishing platforms and leading influencers control most of the traffic which allows them to charge exorbitant pay-to-be-seen fees. This and other supporting factors, especially the drive to boost revenue by publishing a lot of content, result in a prohibitively over-priced and over-crowded innovation showcase stage that favors the rich and savvy over the viable, technologically-sound and value-adding. It is like looking for someone you haven’t met yet, in a dark and noisy nightclub with a high probability they didn’t even clear the bouncer…\n\n# Mission — Marco! Polo!\n\nOrchestra’s mission is to help all interested parties in the Crypto/web3 innovation space to find each other on a level playing field.\n\n# Strategy — Come together\n\n![Come together](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z546IYK0oa5WrqwBNjuFt.png?height=787&width=1400)\n\nWe’ll do this by both removing obstacles and by paving inroads.\n\nIn removing obstacles we mean getting rid of the “noise” created by the current unnatural selection process, i.e., merit-centric curation of strong and reputable pool of Good Innovation Projects (GIPs). In “paving inroads” we mean providing a communal virtual space and conditions that would foster interactions with and in a community of innovation supporters (e.g., investors, partners, OGs, KOLs, journalists, publishers, influencers, and other interested parties we can’t think of right now).\n\nAs can be inferred, we believe that collaboration is a necessary condition for effective innovation. We also believe that given the right conditions, collaboration happens naturally. What we mean is that if we are able to bring people together in a way that provides a good match in terms of resources, needs and mutual interests, they will do the rest on their own.\n\n# Organization — Orchestra is a {Set}\n\nOrchestra is not a website (mobile or otherwise), not a Discord channel (nor Telegram group or any other social platform collective noun), not a platform, not a company, an association or any other legal entity. Orchestra will most probably include some or all of the objects above. However, Orchestra is not defined by any of them.\n\nOrchestra is an organization. In “organization” we mean that it is a set of people that 1) identify as belonging to that set, and 2) are accepted by (enough) other members of the set as belonging to that set, and 3) that act in a way that affects other members of the set. The source of the sense of belonging in our case stems from a shared purpose.

How to make up for it?", "body": "Xinhua news agency, Beijing, May 12 - question: what are the shortcomings of flood control since the strongest rainfall this year? How to make up for it?\n\nXinhua News Agency reporter\n\nAt 18:00 on the 11th, the Central Meteorological Observatory issued the first orange rainstorm warning this year, suggesting that many provinces in southern China will usher in heavy rain, and there will be heavy rain in some areas. It is reported that this is the strongest rainfall since the flood season in the south. What are the shortcomings of flood control in China? How to make up the local short board? Xinhua News Agency reporters conducted interviews in many places.\n\nThe flood control situation is still grim\n\nIn recent days, Guo Jianliang, director of the office of the flood control and drought relief headquarters in Nanxian County, Yiyang City, Hunan Province, has been busy. He should not only organize flood fighting and rescue training, but also arrange personnel to keep an eye on the changes of the flood situation. Once the water situation is severe, he should also organize personnel to patrol the embankment for danger investigation. He told reporters: “Dongting Lake area is the ‘main battlefield’ for flood control and flood fighting. After entering the flood season, we are highly nervous.”\n\nAccording to the analysis and prediction from meteorological and hydrological departments, the flood control situation in many places this year is relatively severe.\n\nMa Jianhua, executive deputy commander-in-chief of the Yangtze River flood control and Drought Relief Headquarters, said that it is predicted that the precipitation in the flood season of the Yangtze River Basin this year is normal and less, but the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation is extremely uneven, the risk of regional floods in the upstream is high, the probability of drought and water shortage in the middle and lower reaches is high, and the possibility of drought and flood coexisting is high.\n\n“Flood risk is still the biggest threat to the Yellow River Basin this year.” Wang Annan, executive deputy commander-in-chief of the Yellow River flood control and Drought Relief Headquarters, said. The prediction and analysis data show that there is more precipitation in the Yellow River Basin this summer. Among them, the precipitation in the north of Hetao is close to the whole year, the precipitation in the South and lower reaches of the middle reaches is 20-40% more, and that in other areas is less than 20%. It is reported that most of the areas with excessive rainfall forecast are the main source areas of flood and sediment caused by the Yellow River. Once a large flood is formed, both water and sediment will fall, making it very difficult to defend. In addition, with the increasing impact of global climate change in recent years and the further increase of flood disaster risk in the Yellow River Basin, the flood control situation of the Yellow River this year is still grim.\n\nThere are multiple short boards in flood control\n\nMa Jianhua said: “at present, the flood control and disaster reduction capacity of the Yangtze River Basin has been significantly improved, but the weak links are still prominent. It will take a long time to improve the flood control and disaster reduction system.”\n\nThe shortage of manpower and great financial pressure have been the short board of flood control in various places for many years. Huarong County, Yueyang City, Hunan Province, is known as “standing on the Yangtze River and stepping on the Dongting”. The first-line flood control dike is 325km long, accounting for about 10% of the total length of the first-line flood control dike in Hunan Province. Wang Zhong, deputy director of Huarong County Water Conservancy Bureau, introduced that Dongting Lake area is the main agricultural production area. A large number of young and strong labor force go out to work, and the left behind personnel are difficult to bear the heavy flood control work. Cadres in Henan, Hubei and other places also reported that the shortage of flood control manpower means that investment should be increased. At the same time, some water conservancy facilities also need to be improved, and local financial pressure is also great.\n\nThe 2022 Yellow River flood control and drought relief work conference revealed that there are many weak links in the flood control engineering system of the Yellow River Basin. Including the low embankment standard of some sections of the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the flood control project in the middle reaches has not yet formed a system, and the downstream “secondary suspended river” channel shape, wandering channel and “moving bed” situation exacerbate the flood risk. “The river conditions in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, with high hanging rivers, wide beaches and many people, and the coexistence of flood and sediment, have not changed, and the situation is still grim,” Wang Annan said\n\nUrban flood control also faces multiple weaknesses. Yuan Zhenlong, director of the Institute of comprehensive management of the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, said that many old urban areas lack the overall planning of flood control functions in the early stage of construction, or the planning is not scientific and accurate enough, the building density in the central urban area is high, and the flood control standards of bungalow areas and old residential areas are low, which makes these areas easy to become weak links of urban flood control. “In some areas, rivers, wetlands and depressions have been occupied, and the urban water storage space is narrow, which can not give full play to the water storage function when the rainstorm comes.” Yuan Zhenlong said.\n\nStrong ability, build team and make up for weaknesses\n\nRecently, in some concave bridge areas in Beijing, the staff of Beijing Drainage Group are installing surveillance cameras to monitor the ponding in the bridge area in real time during the flood season, so as to find the ponding in time and dispose it quickly.\n\nBeijing Drainage Group has increased the total pumping capacity of 88 rainwater pump stations of the group to 750000 cubic meters per hour since 2013. “Last year, we further improved emergency rescue equipment, with a total emergency rescue capacity of 205000 cubic meters per hour, an increase of 17 times compared with 2011.” Beijing Drainage Group official said.\n\nIn rural areas, all localities try their best to make up for the shortcomings of flood control and emergency response capacity by strengthening real-time monitoring, information construction and establishing professional teams. Huarong County investigated the rural young and middle-aged labor force at home before the flood season, organized 17453 assault and patrol personnel and registered them, and established a 100 person county-level flood control emergency rescue militia company and an 80 person County rescue emergency engineering team. “Putting the work ahead avoids the difficulty of organizing temporary personnel.” Wang Zhong told reporters.\n\n“The accumulated rainfall of Xuanmiaoguan reservoir has exceeded 100 mm. We must increase patrols and pay attention to prevent mountain torrents and landslides.” Recently, with the continuous rainfall, Chen Jiangling, a government worker in Leizu Town, Yuan’an County, Yichang City, Hubei Province, received a number of messages on her mobile phone.\n\nThe situation of rainwater in mountainous areas is relatively complex, and people live scattered. According to chenjiangling, a monitoring cloud platform has been established locally, so that the rain information can be monitored in real time, and can be seen at a glance on the platform. Then, the disaster early warning information can be timely released to flood control personnel and people in flood threatened areas through various media such as mobile phone short message platform, wechat official account and video number.\n\n“For the 63 hidden geological hazards identified, we not only put forward preventive and rectification measures, but also establish an on-site inspection mechanism. In case of flood, village cadres and emergency team members will be required to dispatch quickly for emergency disposal to ensure that the hidden risks are controlled and build a safety screen for the people.” Chen Jiangling said.

Ziwei celebrates after the game on July 2. On February 7, Ren Ziwei won the men’s 1000m short track speed skating final of this winter Olympic Games and became the first “double gold” winner of the Chinese ice and snow corps at this winter Olympic Games. “The students I took have won various awards, but I have a dream that has not come true. That is, no child has won the Olympic champion yet.” Two years ago, Wang Beiming, Ren Ziwei’s Enlightenment coach, expressed this regret in a conversation with Ren Ziwei. At that time, Ren Ziwei said with determination that he was confident to help the teacher realize this dream. In 2010, Ren Ziwei suffered an accidental fracture during the competition. At that time, Ren Ziwei’s mother didn’t want him to continue training, so Wang Beiming personally communicated with his parents. Later, Wang Beiming went to work for Ren Ziwei and asked him if he liked the sport and whether he wanted to continue practicing. He replied that he still wanted to, but his parents disagreed. “Miss Wang, do you think I’m ok?” Ren Ziwei was very confused at that time. Wang Beiming replied, “if you say you can, I’ll say you can. If you say you can’t, I’ll say you can’t.” Ren Ziwei said he would do it. Wang Beiming led Ren Ziwei to train for 10 years and witnessed Ren Ziwei grow from a child to the provincial team and national team, and then to win two gold medals in the Beijing Winter Olympics. Ren Ziwei is still expected to win the gold medal in the next two events of the men’s 500 meter relay and the men’s 5000 meter relay in the Winter Olympics.", "timestamp": 1653242497, "digest": "0J84WDUaqTDQdxrjeobNOzYhzDq5NEEA7e1yyGiUlMU", "contributor": "0x4fd71871D9FA215D255E2297B5aB0C8e756e7Dc7"}

If you're not happy with something, change it. Everything is in our minds; if you can change your mind, you will be able to change your reality.\n\nDo not accept things for the sake of it. Question why things should be that way and how you could make them different. At the end of the day, the only thing that matters is you. If I were you, I would make myself the number one priority.\n\nYour happiness is yours. Luckily being happy, you can make others happy. If life is a game, we should have fun playing it. If we decide to suffer, let it be for something worth it.\n\nWhy wait so long to do something you want to do? How many people have ended up doing nothing? Nothing in life is permanent. The only thing that will be permanent for the course of your life is you. So fall in love with yourself since it's the only permanent thing.\n\nPeople come and go, thoughts and emotions come and go, and nothing stays put. The only thing that comes and goes is time. Time passes but never returns. Every second that passes is one second closer to death. Make your time the most important asset you have. Learn to spend it. There is nothing more valuable than time.\n\nLove with all your being, do not shy away from loving. Loving is our nature. No one should prevent you from living. Learn to love; if I were you, I would start with myself. Loving yourself is the most extraordinary act of love you will do in your life. The moment you learn to love yourself, you will be reborn.\n\nLife is simple; our human mind complicates it. We spend so much time wanting things, aching for those things, and so little time appreciating what we already have. Be thankful for everything you have, and being alive is more than enough to feel grateful.\n\nThis message is for whoever, wherever, and whenever.

We all have different ways of feeling loved and wanted.\n\nRest assured that life will be whatever you want it to be. Figure out what you want your life to be.

The language system features a complex of 3D animation, typographic design, abstracted linguistics, Rorschach style inkblots, and procedural monochromatic animations.\n\nThe exhibition’s visual language was the result of over a year's worth of research and development.\n\n> “The approach we took with BAB was essentially linguistic and architectural, having an evocative language as the center of the system made it easy to sculpt around the pieces.” - Moustafa Hassan\n\nThe second output of the project’s research was utilizing B.A.B’s language system in the creation of an interactive care plan designed by web3 smart company m3ga.\n\n> “We wanted to reexamine how a research study engages with black audiences. Typically most studies are uninformed, cultural discordant and just straight boring. Therefore we wanted to tap into mimetics as a pathway to really connect with people using a shared language.” - Gregory Ketant\n\nDeveloped using the [VideoAsk](https://m3ga.world/) platform, the interactive care plan featured response choices such as conditional logic, multiple response options, & contact forms to make the conversation and community building seamless. The diversity in response types allowed the project to think more interpersonally when developing the prompts for the survey.\n\nThe interactive care plan aims to gather the measurable effects of systematic race-related trauma that black artists experience.

Therefore we have decided to leverage the power of web3 to metastasize the exhibition into a DAO; **ghost**DAO.\n\nThe structure of **ghost**DAO is inspired by the utility found in temporary or transitional architecture. Temporary architecture provides a framework for research and experimentation, allowing architects to present their visions on an international stage, with the aim of advancing practice and stimulating innovation.\n\n> Temporary architecture is a fertile ground for testing ideas, examining places, and popularizing new concepts and technologies.\n\nThis architectural framework serves as the conceptual basis for **ghost**DAO; a DAO purposely built for experimentation, examining new practices, and processes for identifying burnout for black artists as well as introducing new concepts in mental health advocacy, innovative treatment & more activities.\n\nOnce our stated goals are met, the **ghost**DAO will dissolve leaving behind all of the research, development, data, and documentation available to the artist community, on-chain.

{"id": "7DflQJiwi4Qojf0NfxtGeFDzY0iGM49UdicXcwqRqeE", "title": "How we found our Teddy :)", "body": "Last summer Sam FaceTime'd me & was talking to me about NFT’s. I knew what NFT’s were before we had that conversation but just never paid attention to it. He said : bro this space is perfect for you, don’t ask me why just go on twitter & join any NFT twitter space and you’ll find your journey, I am so excited to see where this story goes from here…\n\nI still remember saying : bro it’s 4 in the morning rn on a Saturday night and you’re telling me to go on twitter space rn and follow some monkey’s??? lol\n\nIn my mind I was like this dude’s lit & out of his right frame of mind. Finishing our sentences he said Teddy trust me, I know you and I am telling you this is a one way ticket to the life you have always dreamed but never lived and opportunities like this are very hard to find. I just laughed at it and I was like I’ll think about it and let you know…\n\nThen after a week I was playing soccer with Shadow in my backyard thinking about what Sam said the other day and the way he said it it was full of light. I could literally feel those good vibes. Btw Sam is a well known artist in the space, and now after spending all this time in this space I get it why he was hyper that day. Anyways, then I went on my twitter and switched my profile form private to public. I joined my first twitter space, It was with @NFTPrince & NFTsquirrels. Both are living legends and I respect them a lot. They shared tons of selfless advice to me on first day without even knowing who I was, what my real name is, or how I looked like. The knowledge was so valuable that basically I’ve never been rugged / scammed in this space till date. \n\nAfter spending some time in different spaces and observing how everything is working in this ecosystem, I focused on the fundamentals, the way people interact and react with certain things, what values they carried, and how do they find their feeling of importance. It was’nt very difficult for me to figure these things out because of my knowledge & experience with Social Media for over 5 years. I grew 36 million+ followers on Instagram via different entertainment pages and a network of over 250 million+ followers via networking in less than 6 months with just 2,000$ to start with from my college dorm.\n\nDuring that time Bored Ape’s were just flying and they still are but the vibes were immaculate last year you can’t deny that. I literally did a PHD on them and I was just astounded by their story but I was able to relate a lot of it to my life, it was so inspiring and fascinating. I was thinking so much about it, that even in my dreams I was seeing NFT’s all around me and my life changed the night of September 30 when i had that one lucid dream, I decided to do a project to share my story so that others can relate to it and be a part of it. \n\n( Note : This was’nt the main reason for me to do a NFT project. My main goal was and is still the same today that I want to leave this NFT space better than how I found it. )\n\nBack to the story, why Teddy? Well obviously. My friend’s call me Teddy and Teddies have been a part of everyone’s childhood and I believe people will hold on to that tradition forever. They provide us the comfort & companionship, a friend to talk to, and it’s not just kids who benefit from the positive effects of a comforting Teddy squeeze. Teddies are just universal and timeless.\n\nI put all of my traits and character and imagination’s in the art, from my expressions to the way I dress. Some of the assets are added for the aesthetics of the collection. I am not an artist but since I was the character I worked with few freelance artist’s to bring my idea on paper. They asked me for a sketch to give an idea of what I wanted and this is what I sent them lmao 😂😂😂😂😂😂\n\n![ That Yu-Gi-Oh and LV belt part has my heart lmaoooo😭😭😭. Tbh this image is still a lot better than my first one. Btw I am not rich lol, I don't have a AP watch or fancy items.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p7SJwXfpBXm-_G9fiTlu0.jpg?height=1280&width=960)\n\n![This looks decent lol. Lot better than what I came up with.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vxl5Z9dogU0G7wxHt-euI.png?height=1280&width=720)\n\n![That's me on the Left! Dw I am doxed to all our past holder's and lot of people in NFT space know me irl. My identity is just not public in the space atm. I'll reveal it when time is right.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CL1JyGEQS_ynX1v0M1WGn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nBack to the story, so once I got this I reached out to few professional artist’s in my network and I worked with multiple of them to find the perfect Teddy. We wanted to stick with 2D because 3D art is great but the market seemed to be doing well with 2D more than 3D collections. Ofcs art style isn’t the main reason for it but it does play a role. But then I am like let’s take the challenge and create something insane. During the time when I started the project, their were’nt any 3D project’s coming out just yet nor there were any noticeable Teddy Bear collections popping as long as I know. So then we decided to turn this into 3D. During this process one 3D artist reached out to me in my DM’s of one our meme page asking to collab, I am like okay cool lets give it a shot and see what you got. \n\n![This is what he came up with as base model. 💀💀💀](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FcshCcWqBzufElk9puKnW.png?height=772&width=778)\n\nYeah he just lost me on that base model. If ur surprised, I did’nt see this coming either, when I saw it for the first time I was out of words just like you are rn. I seriously had no comments on this image. So yeah I had to say no to that dude and look for another artist. The fact that people fake their LinkedIn and show you proof of work of other artist is just hilarious. So I asked one of my friend on telegram if he knew any artist to connect me and he did. \n\n![Idk tbh, it was just not it.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z3yiJzSTaGmqQdaHZroTJ.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nIt just did’nt feel right going with the full body at this point, gave pfp style a shot and see how it does. Initially the idea was, we will do pfp collection and in a seperate contract and we will give the holders full body version of their Teddy so they have both and can use it the way they like whether to animate or so with the source file…\n\n![I finally said yes to this one and made a deal with the artist and gave her an upfront amount for her time that we both agreed on. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ef-d0SnN5nrZH4EpHIfbn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThe decided to upfront because she told me she had financial instability and urgently need of money for rent and expenses so she would’nt be able to work full time on this project and it would take lot longer to complete the collection than what I was expecting. Plus I genuinely wanted to help her regardless of if she would work for the project or not due to her situation. \n\n![My mind, Her ability.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q7q8YdENYDP5zDlajLh05.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nWe decided to fully render and rigg the collection in the end after all the traits and assets are illustrated and confirmed so that their isn't any confusions and nothing is left out. But unfortunately when she submitted, the quality of collection turned out terrible atleast from my pov. I communicated it with our community and told them that ‘guys we do not have the collection fully rigged and its in between 2D and 3D so we would have to pause the project for now until we find another artist and see how things go from there’. \n\nBut then I was also out of funds because I put everything I had in the project initially. So I communicated this with the community in our discord and 34 people ended up minting 100 regardless of the situation. 10 were minted for team and 1 was minted by me personally to participate in the process just like any other member of community. They knew that mint had zero value and won’t have a secondary market value but yet they still supported. So that moment onwards my belief in the project became even stronger and quitting was never an option no matter what situation I go through. The collection won’t ever be revealed because I don’t believe in trying to sell some bullshit to people just to pocket some eth. In trying to sell NFT’s I am not going to sell my character, tf I look like? ZagaBond? There is a big fat difference between failing and abandoning your project. We don’t give up around here…This project is my dream and it like a child to me. I want to be the best out there in anything I do in life. Whether if it is playing soccer or anything that I hold dear too I give my absolute best to win. When I play soccer I don’t play to just participate I play to make difference, I play to dominate the field. \n\n[https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub](https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub)\n\nSo yeah that was my first failure in NFT space, I learned a lot from that failure. The most important thing was that when starting a business do everything you can to gather great people that have the same drive & BELIEVE IN YOUR VISION as you do. Because in the end all a business is a group of people dedicated to provide service or product to people. Take care of your team like your family & they’ll take care of your business & customers. \n\nThen after I did an outreach again and managed to find a team of 4 professional 3D artist’s. Their past ventures have involved working with brands like Puma, Bangs and Lulu Lemon. Their Identities are anon as they wish to keep it that way but I have confirmed the veracity of their credentials. When I presented this entire idea and vision of the collection to them, after hearing me they instantly said yes and told be that we believe in you and we’re gonna make the best collection of 2022. We started working on it the same day and even with this team, I worked 1 on 1 with the team over screen shares for every single trait’s and asset’s and outcomes are just fantastic. Look It does’nt matter what people think of it but we do believe it is one of the greatest NFT collections that will ever be deployed on Blockchain. We’ve put our blood, sweat and tears in this collection as a team day in and day out. The collection is timeless & it will age well I can make that one promise for sure. \n\n![This collection is dedicated to someone who does'nt need to own it. It's a dream come true. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wKl-h3xgt9G73xjvxW_7_.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThere is no bigger feeling than making your dream come true and the story will never have an end to be honest. I am just the captain of the boat as of now but at some point I want to hand the dream over to the community in a position that even if I am not present the story live forever as long as their is imagination left in this world. \n\nBig hug & Thank you for your time and consideration for reading this. I genuinely appreciate your presence here with all my heart.

Rather then fetishize black trauma, we utilized art as a device to create sustainable resistance measures to envisage better experiences for black artists.\n\n![3D Avatar: Khalid](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i2wksw2q9s53364/We%20Got%20You.gif?raw=1)\n\n## The Mission\n\nThe project’s fundamental objective is to raise awareness of the deleterious effects of burnout as it specifically relates to black artists. B.A.B provides visibility for an under-diagnosed issue and representation to better the landscape for those who deal with race-related trauma in the artist ecosystem.\n\n> B.A.B was commissioned by contemporary digital art and technology archive Rhizome, and co-presented with The New Museum.\n\n![3D Avatar: Kiyana](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bl1n6eoowrkzb7k/RHZ%20Transition.gif?raw=1)\n\nExamples of symptoms of burn-out for black artists:\n\n* Persistent penalization for speaking out against racist institutions leading to self-initiated deletion of social accounts\n* Emotional, mental, and psychological distress leading to prolonged hiatus, inconsistent engagement, and detachment from the artist community\n* Lack of interest to remain present due to low incentive; meaning lessened ability to maintain a quality standard of living from which most of one's time is invested\n\n> Burnout is categorized as a \"syndrome\" that results from \"chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed.” ([WHO International Disease Classification CD-11](https://www.who.int/news/item/28-05-2019-burn-out-an-occupational-phenomenon-international-classification-of-diseases)).\n\n## Folk • Tech: Interactive Care Plan\n\n![Left to Right: Lizz, Nuenoto, Max](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c76ru71k9k5z3tu/Cereal%20Box.gif?raw=1)\n\nA critical innovation in B.A.B’s development is the exhibition’s visual language. The language system features a complex of 3D animation, typographic design, abstracted linguistics, Rorschach style inkblots, and procedural monochromatic animations.\n\nThe exhibition’s visual language was the result of over a year's worth of research and development.\n\n> “The approach we took with BAB was essentially linguistic and architectural, having an evocative language as the center of the system made it easy to sculpt around the pieces.” - Moustafa Hassan\n\nThe second output of the project’s research was utilizing B.A.B’s language system in the creation of an interactive care plan designed by web3 smart company m3ga.\n\n> “We wanted to reexamine how a research study engages with black audiences. Typically most studies are uninformed, cultural discordant and just straight boring. Therefore we wanted to tap into mimetics as a pathway to really connect with people using a shared language.” - Gregory Ketant\n\nDeveloped using the [VideoAsk](https://m3ga.world/) platform, the interactive care plan featured response choices such as conditional logic, multiple response options, & contact forms to make the conversation and community building seamless. The diversity in response types allowed the project to think more interpersonally when developing the prompts for the survey.\n\nThe interactive care plan aims to gather the measurable effects of systematic race-related trauma that black artists experience. The goal is to see how the interpretation of the information provided can guide a larger community towards finding solutions around inequity and harm reduction that produce observable results.\n\n![  “When we suffer in silence conditions for chronic stress are created. If left unaddressed and unresolved burnout occurs.”](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k7dbvi0lfxtsd72/Ink%20Transition.gif?raw=1)\n\n## Early Look at the Data\n\n[PSA 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC0xlB6KwD0)\n\nTo date, the interactive care plan has reached over 300+ impressions and generated over 100 conversations spanning 3 continents, 5 countries, and over a dozen cities.\n\nA snapshot of early statistics gathered from the study:\n\n* 63% of the respondents identify as black\n* 7% of the respondents identify as indigenous\n* 31% of the respondents identify as non-black / non-indigenous\n* 20% of respondents have completed the study\n* 34% of respondents have completed half of the study’s questions/prompts\n\nWe are currently coordinating outreach to connect respondents to provide any needed emotional or logistical support to finish the study.\n\n> **Note**: Anyone is invited to take part in the study however participants who identify as non-black / non-indigenous are considered a part of the control group data cohort.\n\n![Preview from the B.A.B collection that will be up for auction soon.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j5eG6uuKzS4GO07nuvhZv.png?height=3616&width=3616)\n\n![Prototype identity for ghostDAO](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E2A6N4LXv3z-jRNV7KZju.png?height=620&width=2126)\n\nDuring the development of the exhibition, we realized that B.A.B has an opportunity to make a much larger, sustainable impact beyond creating awareness of this underdiagnosed issue. We surmised that if the exhibition is already generating community-led conversations, as well as creating solutions, then B.A.B is already doing the work of an institution. Therefore we have decided to leverage the power of web3 to metastasize the exhibition into a DAO; **ghost**DAO.\n\nThe structure of **ghost**DAO is inspired by the utility found in temporary or transitional architecture. Temporary architecture provides a framework for research and experimentation, allowing architects to present their visions on an international stage, with the aim of advancing practice and stimulating innovation.\n\n> Temporary architecture is a fertile ground for testing ideas, examining places, and popularizing new concepts and technologies.\n\nThis architectural framework serves as the conceptual basis for **ghost**DAO; a DAO purposely built for experimentation, examining new practices, and processes for identifying burnout for black artists as well as introducing new concepts in mental health advocacy, innovative treatment & more activities.\n\nOnce our stated goals are met, the **ghost**DAO will dissolve leaving behind all of the research, development, data, and documentation available to the artist community, on-chain. Our intention by dissolving is to leave the framework for community-led efforts that focus on missions instead of the institutionalization of action.\n\n### Why a DAO?\n\n[Nexus\\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LQPNN9zgYc)\n\nLimitations to resources and barriers to education have presented themselves in a number of ways while producing this exhibition. **ghost**DAO serves as a regenerative streamlining of support to accomplish our communities’ goals as our shared needs make themselves known. These key factors, once properly resolved, will no longer stifle the operations of this project:\n\n* Requiring institutional backing or capital to gain access to educational references and resources from academic journals, databases, and other archives\n* Paying for first-hand accounts or sources related to our research; including people or property\n* Investing in new and pre-existing solutions to the problems that arise in the process of the study, as well as those suggested by our data analysis\n* Production and labor costs\n* Mutual aid efforts\n\n### Vodun (Paris)\n\n[crowdfund://0x7213aA1d22A74c03D5fc07871b33E55Db5a7805a?version=podium_1&network=mainnet](crowdfund://0x7213aA1d22A74c03D5fc07871b33E55Db5a7805a?version=podium_1&network=mainnet)\n\nOur roadmap is a mission-based schematic, colloquially known as a *drill*, based on the completion of milestones at which the DAO is triggered to dissolve. The mission for this version of **ghost**DAO is called *Vodun* (Paris).\n\n**1-800-Comfort Calls Installation**\nComfort Calls is the curation of physical platforms for social exchange rooted in self-healing. In incubation pods, participants are invited to initiate 3 activations that encourage them to occupy their mind, time, and space with concepts around collective wellness.\n\n**B.A.B: Interactive Care Plan: Version 2**\nVersion 1 is live right now and we’re already learning what works and what doesn’t. What is the community responding to? Is it really accessible? What can we do to optimize it? % of funds will be allocated to improving the interactive care plan to make a version 2 that will be accessible to multiple languages with an improved design.\n\n**Artificial Intelligence** **Toolkit**\nIn researching ways to create a smart survey, we wanted to employ an analysis method that decreased the amount of subjectivity when looking at participant responses. Therefore we want to develop artificial intelligence tools that can help us achieve a safe, depersonalized method of analysis.\n\n**B.A.B Journal** After we completed our testing and deployment of B.A.B interactive care plan version 2, we will publish / mint a journal of our findings featuring data analyzed using our custom artificial intelligence toolkit.\n\n**Vodun (Paris)**\nThe final mission is to present our concept for black artist reform in a Moorish-inspired diplomatic correspondence to *TBD* Paris based art institutions. The edict will be the sum total of the research, development, and data collected studying the effects of Black Artist Burnout.\n\nOnce funding goals are raised, **ghost**DAO will actively recruit black and indigenous creatives of all types to join our organization.\n\n### UPDATE:\n\nOn April 11, 2022 **ghost**DAO was interviewed by researcher and professor of art history and theory at the National Superior School of Art of Nancy; [Vanina Gere](https://frenchamerican.org/vanina-gere/).

Our intention by dissolving is to leave the framework for community-led efforts that focus on missions instead of the institutionalization of action.\n\n### Why a DAO?\n\n[Nexus\\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LQPNN9zgYc)\n\nLimitations to resources and barriers to education have presented themselves in a number of ways while producing this exhibition. **ghost**DAO serves as a regenerative streamlining of support to accomplish our communities’ goals as our shared needs make themselves known. These key factors, once properly resolved, will no longer stifle the operations of this project:\n\n* Requiring institutional backing or capital to gain access to educational references and resources from academic journals, databases, and other archives\n* Paying for first-hand accounts or sources related to our research; including people or property\n* Investing in new and pre-existing solutions to the problems that arise in the process of the study, as well as those suggested by our data analysis\n* Production and labor costs\n* Mutual aid efforts\n\n### Vodun (Paris)\n\n[crowdfund://0x7213aA1d22A74c03D5fc07871b33E55Db5a7805a?version=podium_1&network=mainnet](crowdfund://0x7213aA1d22A74c03D5fc07871b33E55Db5a7805a?version=podium_1&network=mainnet)\n\nOur roadmap is a mission-based schematic, colloquially known as a *drill*, based on the completion of milestones at which the DAO is triggered to dissolve. The mission for this version of **ghost**DAO is called *Vodun* (Paris).\n\n**1-800-Comfort Calls Installation**\nComfort Calls is the curation of physical platforms for social exchange rooted in self-healing. In incubation pods, participants are invited to initiate 3 activations that encourage them to occupy their mind, time, and space with concepts around collective wellness.\n\n**B.A.B: Interactive Care Plan: Version 2**\nVersion 1 is live right now and we’re already learning what works and what doesn’t. What is the community responding to? Is it really accessible? What can we do to optimize it? % of funds will be allocated to improving the interactive care plan to make a version 2 that will be accessible to multiple languages with an improved design.\n\n**Artificial Intelligence** **Toolkit**\nIn researching ways to create a smart survey, we wanted to employ an analysis method that decreased the amount of subjectivity when looking at participant responses. Therefore we want to develop artificial intelligence tools that can help us achieve a safe, depersonalized method of analysis.\n\n**B.A.B Journal** After we completed our testing and deployment of B.A.B interactive care plan version 2, we will publish / mint a journal of our findings featuring data analyzed using our custom artificial intelligence toolkit.\n\n**Vodun (Paris)**\nThe final mission is to present our concept for black artist reform in a Moorish-inspired diplomatic correspondence to *TBD* Paris based art institutions. The edict will be the sum total of the research, development, and data collected studying the effects of Black Artist Burnout.\n\nOnce funding goals are raised, **ghost**DAO will actively recruit black and indigenous creatives of all types to join our organization.\n\n### UPDATE:\n\nOn April 11, 2022 **ghost**DAO was interviewed by researcher and professor of art history and theory at the National Superior School of Art of Nancy; [Vanina Gere](https://frenchamerican.org/vanina-gere/).

I knew what NFT’s were before we had that conversation but just never paid attention to it. He said : bro this space is perfect for you, don’t ask me why just go on twitter & join any NFT twitter space and you’ll find your journey, I am so excited to see where this story goes from here…\n\nI still remember saying : bro it’s 4 in the morning rn on a Saturday night and you’re telling me to go on twitter space rn and follow some monkey’s??? lol\n\nIn my mind I was like this dude’s lit & out of his right frame of mind. Finishing our sentences he said Teddy trust me, I know you and I am telling you this is a one way ticket to the life you have always dreamed but never lived and opportunities like this are very hard to find. I just laughed at it and I was like I’ll think about it and let you know…\n\nThen after a week I was playing soccer with Shadow in my backyard thinking about what Sam said the other day and tbh I enjoyed hearing him & everything he had to say with enthusiasm over the potential of NFT’s. Btw Sam is a well known artist in the space, and now after spending all this time in this space I get it why he was hyper that day. Anyways, then I went on my twitter and switched my profile form private to public. I joined my first twitter space, It was with @NFTPrince & NFTsquirrels. Both are living legends and I respect them a lot. They shared tons of selfless advice to me on first day without even knowing who I was, what my real name is, or how I looked like. The knowledge was so valuable that basically I’ve never been rugged / scammed in this space till date. \n\nAfter spending some time in different spaces and observing how everything is working in this ecosystem, I focused on the fundamentals, the way people interact and react with certain things, what values they carried, and how do they find their feeling of importance. It was’nt very difficult for me to figure these things out because of my knowledge & experience with Social Media for over 5 years. I grew 36 million+ followers on Instagram via different entertainment pages and a network of over 250 million+ followers via networking in less than 6 months with just 2,000$ to start with from my college dorm.\n\nDuring that time Bored Ape’s were just flying and they still are but the vibes were immaculate last year you can’t deny that. I literally did a PHD on them and I was just astounded by their story but I was able to relate a lot of it to my life, it was so inspiring and fascinating. I was thinking so much about it, that even in my dreams I was seeing NFT’s all around me and my life changed the night of September 30 with that one lucid dream, I decided to do a project to share my story so that others can relate to it and be a part of it. \n\n( Note : This was’nt the main reason for me to do a NFT project. My main goal was and is still the same today that I want to leave this NFT space better than how I found it. )\n\nBack to the story, why Teddy? Well obviously. My friend’s call me Teddy and Teddies have been a part of everyone’s childhood and I believe people will hold on to that tradition forever. They provide us the comfort & companionship, a friend to talk to, and it’s not just kids who benefit from the positive effects of a comforting Teddy squeeze. Teddies are just universal and timeless.\n\nI put all of my traits and character and imagination’s in the art, from my expressions to the way I dress. Some of the assets are added for the aesthetics of the collection. I am not an artist but since I was the character I worked with few freelance artist’s to bring my idea on paper. They asked me for a sketch to give an idea of what I wanted and this is what I sent them lmao 😂😂😂😂😂😂\n\n![ That Yu-Gi-Oh and LV belt part has my heart lmaoooo😭😭😭. Tbh this image is still a lot better than my first one. Btw I am not rich lol, I don't have a AP watch or fancy items.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p7SJwXfpBXm-_G9fiTlu0.jpg?height=1280&width=960)\n\n![This looks decent lol. Lot better than what I came up with.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vxl5Z9dogU0G7wxHt-euI.png?height=1280&width=720)\n\n![That's me on the Left! Dw I am doxed to all our past holder's and lot of people in NFT space know me irl. My identity is just not public in the space atm. I'll reveal it when time is right.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CL1JyGEQS_ynX1v0M1WGn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nBack to the story, so once I got this I reached out to few professional artist’s in my network and I worked with multiple of them to find the perfect Teddy. We wanted to stick with 2D because 3D art is great but the market seemed to be doing well with 2D more than 3D collections. Ofcs art style isn’t the main reason for it but it does play a role. But then I am like let’s take the challenge and create something insane. During the time when I started the project, their were’nt any 3D project’s coming out just yet nor there were any noticeable Teddy Bear collections popping as long as I know. So then we decided to turn this into 3D. During this process one 3D artist reached out to me in my DM’s of one our meme page asking to collab, I am like okay cool lets give it a shot and see what you got. \n\n![This is what he came up with as base model. 💀💀💀](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FcshCcWqBzufElk9puKnW.png?height=772&width=778)\n\nYeah he just lost me on that base model. If ur surprised, I did’nt see this coming either, when I saw it for the first time I was out of words just like you are rn. I seriously had no comments on this image. So yeah I had to say no to that dude and look for another artist. The fact that people fake their LinkedIn and show you proof of work of other artist is just hilarious. So I asked one of my friend on telegram if he knew any artist to connect me and he did. \n\n![Idk tbh, it was just not it.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z3yiJzSTaGmqQdaHZroTJ.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nIt just did’nt feel right going with the full body at this point, gave pfp style a shot and see how it does. Initially the idea was, we will do pfp collection and in a seperate contract and we will give the holders full body version of their Teddy so they have both and can use it the way they like whether to animate or so with the source file…\n\n![I finally said yes to this one and made a deal with the artist and gave her an upfront amount for her time that we both agreed on. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ef-d0SnN5nrZH4EpHIfbn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThe decided to upfront because she told me she had financial instability and urgently need of money for rent and expenses so she would’nt be able to work full time on this project and it would take lot longer to complete the collection than what I was expecting. Plus I genuinely wanted to help her regardless of if she would work for the project or not due to her situation. \n\n![My mind, Her ability.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q7q8YdENYDP5zDlajLh05.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nWe decided to fully render and rigg the collection in the end after all the traits and assets are illustrated and confirmed so that their isn't any confusions and nothing is left out. But unfortunately when she submitted, the quality of collection turned out terrible atleast from my pov. I communicated it with our community and told them that ‘guys we do not have the collection fully rigged and its in between 2D and 3D so we would have to pause the project for now until we find another artist and see how things go from there’. \n\nBut then I was also out of funds because I put everything I had in the project initially. So I communicated this with the community in our discord and 34 people ended up minting 100 regardless of the situation. 10 were minted for team and 1 was minted by me personally to participate in the process just like any other member of community. They knew that mint had zero value and won’t have a secondary market value but yet they still supported. So that moment onwards my belief in the project became even stronger and quitting was never an option no matter what situation I go through. The collection won’t ever be revealed because I don’t believe in trying to sell some bullshit to people just to pocket some eth. In trying to sell NFT’s I am not going to sell my character, tf I look like? ZagaBond? There is a big fat difference between failing and abandoning your project. We don’t give up around here…This project is my dream and it like a child to me. I want to be the best out there in anything I do in life. Whether if it is playing soccer or anything that I hold dear too I give my absolute best to win. When I play soccer I don’t play to just participate I play to make difference, I play to dominate the field. \n\n[https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub](https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub)\n\nSo yeah that was my first failure in NFT space, I learned a lot from that failure. The most important thing was that when starting a business do everything you can to gather great people that have the same drive & BELIEVE IN YOUR VISION as you do. Because in the end all a business is a group of people dedicated to provide service or product to people. Take care of your team like your family & they’ll take care of your business & customers. \n\nThen after I did an outreach again and managed to find a team of 4 professional 3D artist’s. Their past ventures have involved working with brands like Puma, Bangs and Lulu Lemon. Their Identities are anon as they wish to keep it that way but I have confirmed the veracity of their credentials. When I presented this entire idea and vision of the collection to them, after hearing me they instantly said yes and told be that we believe in you and we’re gonna make the best collection of 2022. We started working on it the same day and even with this team, I worked 1 on 1 with the team over screen shares for every single trait’s and asset’s and outcomes are just fantastic. Look It does’nt matter what people think of it but we do believe it is one of the greatest NFT collections that will ever be deployed on Blockchain. We’ve put our blood, sweat and tears in this collection as a team day in and day out. The collection is timeless & it will age well I can make that one promise for sure. \n\n![This collection is dedicated to someone who does'nt need to own it. It's a dream come true. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wKl-h3xgt9G73xjvxW_7_.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThere is no bigger feeling than making your dream come true and the story will never have an end to be honest. I am just the captain of the boat as of now but at some point I want to hand the dream over to the community in a position that even if I am not present the story live forever as long as their is imagination left in this world. \n\nBig hug & Thank you for your time and consideration for reading this. I genuinely appreciate your presence here with all my heart.

The system removes the control banks and institutions have on money, financial products, and financial services.\n\nSome of the key attractions of DeFi for many consumers are:\n\n* It eliminates the fees that banks and other financial companies charge for using their services.\n* You hold your money in a secure digital wallet instead of keeping it in a bank.\n* Anyone with an internet connection can use it without needing approval.\n* You can transfer funds in seconds and minutes.\n\n  ### Decentralized Finance\n\n  Decentralized finance eliminates intermediaries by allowing people, merchants, and businesses to conduct financial transactions through emerging technology. This is accomplished through peer-to-peer financial networks that use security protocols, connectivity, software, and hardware advancements.\n\n  From anywhere you have an internet connection, you can lend, trade, and borrow using software that records and verifies financial actions in distributed financial databases. A distributed database is accessible across various locations; it collects and aggregates data from all users and uses a consensus mechanism to verify it.\n\n  Decentralized finance uses this technology to eliminate centralized finance models by enabling anyone to use financial services anywhere regardless of who or where they are.\n\n  DeFi applications give users more control over their money through personal wallets and trading services that cater to individuals.", "timestamp": 1653245371, "digest": "dMPO6CJ-fZtOv13vssskl_cfPKwGA07KdSgawA8n0VQ", "contributor": "0x2169Ec73eeB5287Ed3180b401B6383BEaf5a2011"}

{"id": "Pqqol7jeEi583r4UcDCDnqAizyby41Nf8hYr7m8rdqw", "title": "In April, the production and sales of automobile enterprises were cut by half, and new energy became popular against the market", "body": "Recently, the passenger Federation released the latest passenger car sales in April. According to the data, in April 2022, the retail sales volume of the domestic narrow passenger car market reached 1043000, with a year-on-year decrease of 35.5% and a month on month decrease of 34.0%. The year-on-year and month on month growth rate of retail in April were at the lowest in the history of that month. From January to April, a total of 5.958 million vehicles were retailed, a year-on-year decrease of 11.9%.\n\nIn this regard, the China Railway Passenger Transport Federation pointed out that due to the impact of the epidemic, there is a shortage of imported parts, domestic parts system suppliers involved in the Yangtze River Delta are unable to supply in time, and some even completely shut down or shut down. In addition, the logistics efficiency is reduced and the transportation time is uncontrollable, resulting in the prominent problem of poor production.\n\nIn addition, in April, the production of five major auto enterprises in Shanghai decreased by 75% month on month compared with March, the production of joint venture major auto enterprises in Changchun decreased by 54%, and the overall decline in other regions was 38%. The national radiation effect of the parts system in Shanghai was prominent. It can be seen that the impact of the epidemic on the automotive industry is still great.\n\nAuto Enterprises: SAIC’s sales are greatly affected\n\nDue to the impact of the epidemic, the sales ranking of automobile enterprises changed greatly in April. The champion of FAW Volkswagen was taken away by BYD, and the sales volume of SAIC (including SAIC Volkswagen, SAIC GM and SAIC GM Wuling) fell collectively. In particular, SAIC GM Wuling has fallen out of the top ten list.\n\nAlthough the sales volume of independent brands is passable, Geely and Chang’an are on the list one after another, but the sales volume data is not good-looking, and great wall motor also ranks outside the top 10; It is noteworthy that the overall performance of the Japanese system is fairly good, with GAC Toyota in the third place and Dongfeng Nissan in the second place.\n\nBYD, which ranked first, had a brilliant sales performance in April, reaching 105000 vehicles. It was also the only auto enterprise with a sales volume of more than 100000 vehicles in April, with a year-on-year increase of 138.4% and a market share of 10%. It has to be said that BYD’s achievements with new energy vehicles are worth learning from many car enterprises. In particular, the model equipped with DM-I super hybrid system launched by BYD is very popular and the product is excellent enough.\n\nThe sales volume of Geely Automobile and Chang’an Automobile, both independent brands, also declined to varying degrees in April. Among them, Geely Automobile sold 54600 vehicles in April, with a year-on-year decrease of 40.4% and a market share of 5.2%, ranking fifth; Chang’an Automobile followed, with a sales volume of 53700, with a market share of 5.2%, ranking sixth.\n\nUnfortunately, Great Wall Motors has been squeezed out of the top ten list in April. According to the official data released by Great Wall Motors, the Haval brand sold 29125 vehicles in April; Euler brand sells 3088 vehicles; Wei brand sells 2293 vehicles; The tank brand sells 6065 vehicles.\n\nAccording to our rough calculation, the sales volume of the passenger car sector of Great Wall Motor in April was only more than 40000, and the data of the passenger Federation was 35600. In this regard, Great Wall attributed the problem to the domestic epidemic, supply chain, logistics and other impacts, but this is also a common problem faced by all auto enterprises. However, the decline of great wall motor is obvious, which shows that great wall motor is still under great pressure.\n\nNext, let’s look at the sales performance of the joint venture brand in April. FAW Volkswagen sold 81000 vehicles in April, down 49.2% year-on-year, losing the championship, which is not a small gap with BYD’s sales of 105000 vehicles; The same brother SAIC Volkswagen was even worse, with sales of only 52000 vehicles, down 52.4% year-on-year, falling to the eighth place, mainly due to the impact of the epidemic and the shortage of parts.\n\nSAIC General Motors of SAIC system sold only 50000 vehicles in April, a year-on-year decline of 57% and a market share of 4.8%, ranking ninth. Similarly, as the main sales source of SAIC Group, SAIC GM has made some miserable achievements. At the same time, SAIC GM Wuling was also squeezed out of the top 10. The impact of the epidemic in Shanghai on SAIC Group is indeed not small.\n\nThe performance of Sino Japanese brands of joint venture car enterprises is fairly reasonable. GAC Toyota ranked third, with sales of 64000 vehicles in April, down 7.3% year-on-year. GAC Toyota is the enterprise with the lowest sales decline among the top ten car enterprises. Compared with Japanese Dongfeng Nissan, Dongfeng Honda and GAC Honda, the decline is not obvious.\n\nDongfeng Nissan ranked fourth, with sales of 58000 vehicles in April, a year-on-year decline of 43.4% and a market share of 5.5%. Dongfeng Nissan’s sales volume is good, or Xuanyi’s car is the biggest credit. If the reason for the decline in sales volume is not only the cause of the epidemic, but also the defect in the product power of xinxinjun, which leads to the obvious decline in sales volume.\n\nAmong the Japanese series, the sales volume of Honda series is average. The sales volume of Dongfeng Honda in April was 52000 vehicles, down 38.4% year-on-year, with a market share of 5%; GAC Honda sold 43000 vehicles, a year-on-year decline of 33.2% and a market share of 4.1%. The year-on-year decline of the two car companies exceeded 30%, and the sales performance was very general.\n\nBecause of the epidemic, many auto enterprises suffered serious losses, especially the shortage of parts led to the shutdown and shutdown of auto enterprises. Although the follow-up factories began to resume production, it was very difficult to catch up in a short time.\n\nSUV: BYD wins Grand Slam\n\nFrom the performance of SUV segment market, the cumulative sales volume in April was 459000, a year-on-year decrease of 38.6% and a month on month decrease of 38.1%; From January to April, the cumulative sales volume was 2.767 million, a year-on-year decrease of 11%.\n\nFrom the ranking of SUV sales in April, the overall characteristics are as follows: the BYD Song family still performed well, won the champion of SUV sales, and the performance of 25105 vehicles far exceeded that of Honda CR-V and Haval H6, which ranked second and third. In addition, BYD’s other SUV models, such as BYD Tang and BYD yuan plus, are all in the top 10 of the list;\n\nHaval H6 still failed to turn over this time, ranking third, suppressed by BYD Song family and Honda CR-V; In the high-end luxury SUV market, Mercedes Benz GLC and BMW X3 have entered the list, and Audi Q5 has disappeared; Because of the impact of the epidemic, Tesla Model y disappeared from the list. Next, we briefly analyze the market performance of each SUV model.\n\nIn the first place is the BYD Song family. The sales volume in April was 25105, with a year-on-year increase of 60.2%.

What contribution has it made to realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation? What valuable historical experience do you have? What should the Communist Youth League do in the new era?  \n\nNi Bangwen, Secretary of the Party committee of the Central Youth League school (China Youth Political College), said: “the important speech of the general secretary is highly political, ideological and strategic. It comprehensively and systematically reviews the history of the Communist Youth League in the past 100 years and points out the direction for the party’s youth work in the new era.”\n\nThe fate of youth has always been closely linked with the times. More than 100 years ago, when the nation was in danger, a group of young people who first awakened held high the banner of Marxism and lit the revolutionary fire in the dark night. In 1921, a group of young people with an average age of 28 established the Communist Party of China. Once the Communist Party of China was born, it paid attention to the youth and placed the hope of revolution on the youth. On May 5, 1922, under the direct care and leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Communist Youth League of China was established. Since then, the Chinese youth movement has opened a new chapter in history.\n\nWhat the party flag refers to is what the regiment flag refers to. From the day of its birth, the Communist Youth League has always been unswervingly following the party. In the course of a hundred years of struggle, the Communist Youth League has united the majority of Chinese youth, listened to the party’s command and fought with the party, and has made positive contributions and played an important role in various historical periods.\n\nOver the past 100 years, generation after generation of League members and young people have advanced one after another for the country and the nation. In the journey of striving for national independence, they rushed to the front and shed their blood; In the vast world of new China, they worked selflessly and worked hard; They are at the forefront of reform, opening up and modernization\n\nDean of the Youth Development Institute of the University of international business and economics Lian Si, an expert member of the national medium and long term youth development plan, said: “If we look at the history of this league, I think it is a song of youth played by the youth love party and the party love youth polyphony. On the one hand, the youth love the party, and the majority of young people sincerely follow the party to build a new China in the decadent world, in which the Communist Youth League has also played the value of the times of organizing and mobilizing young people; on the other hand, the party loves young people, and the party spared no effort to build a stage and create a platform for young people What role can we see the Communist Youth League play? It is an important mission to convey the voice of the party, gather the opinions of young people and ensure the development of young people. “\n\n \n\n  To guide the formulation of the first youth development plan and the first white paper specially issued for youth groups in the history of new China; Put forward a series of new ideas, viewpoints and conclusions around youth work to promote all-round progress and historic achievements in China’s youth development.\n\nLi Di, deputy director of the Youth Rights and interests Department of the Communist Youth League Central Committee, said: “while promoting and leading the party’s youth work, the general secretary also answered a series of major strategic topics such as what kind of youth to cultivate in the new era, how to cultivate youth, what kind of Communist Youth League to build and how to build the Communist Youth League, which provides fundamental guidance and guidance for the work of the Communist Youth League and the party’s youth work.”\n\nWhat are the Chinese youth like in the new era? We can see that during the outbreak raid, nearly half of the medical staff in Wuhan were “post-90s” and “post-00s”. In the major task of tackling key scientific and technological problems, a large number of young scientific and technological talents have played a leading role: the average age of “Shenzhou team” is 33 years old, and the average age of China Tianyan fast R & D team is only 30 years old\n\nAt the 2022 Winter Olympics, Su Yiming and a large number of athletes worked hard to let people see the best appearance of youth.\n\nOn the battlefield of poverty alleviation, in the process of defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and at every critical moment when the motherland and the people need it, the Communist Youth League has united and led the Youth League members to shoulder the heavy burden entrusted by the state and the nation, and demonstrated their determination and responsibility with practical actions.\n\n \n\nThe long march from generation to generation. Realizing the Chinese dream is a historical relay race. At present, the great changes in the world that have not been seen in a century have accelerated the evolution, and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered a critical period. On the new journey, how to better unite, organize and mobilize young people to strive for the realization of the second Centennial goal and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is a major issue that must be answered by China’s youth movement and youth work in the new era.\n\nLian Si said: “in his speech, the general secretary put forward four hopes for the Communist Youth League. Adhering to educating people for the party is the fundamental task of the Communist Youth League’s work. Conscientious responsibility is actually a duty and mission of the Communist Youth League. Caring for the majority of young people is a driving source of the Communist Youth League’s work. Being brave in self revolution is actually a fundamental guarantee for the Communist Youth League’s continuous self iteration and self-development.”\n\n  for instance,", "timestamp": 1653245573, "digest": "uPi7WPgb4IiR__ScPz5ijQNsX2AwbSBnJm0QzU7p8R4", "contributor": "0x0727CBC189380057FEd7E2ECe1d60099dECa589d"}

{"id": "pmlHLQppScxont1uIa8CBC4P1zWTMZguNiuyQUwiVcs", "title": "Why Owning NFTs Will Be The Future of Your Identity ", "body": "By [Zachary Scott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharyscott01/)\n\nIn the wake of what can only be described as a global NFT craze, I find myself wondering what more there is to the future of NFTs other than digital art…\n\n**Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and more specifically their smart contracts may prove to have a much deeper and more transformative impact than most casual observers would expect. There is a day on the horizon where NFTs will form the basis of our identities and reflect the characteristics of our individual personalities.**\n\nLooking beyond “material” possessions (and not material in the sense of tangible items as we all know that by definition NFTs are not quite this) but material in the sense of valuable digital art of which we have seen many amazing [examples](https://foundation.app/). 2021 was the year that NFTs became mainstream, but the more we learn the more we realise there is still a long way to go in the development of this technology with many real-world [use cases](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763) that will impact our everyday life, on the surface and within.\n\n**It's not about what you own but who you can become**\n\n[Alex Danco](https://alexdanco.com/) does a truly fantastic job at describing this in Packy McCormick’s [Not Boring – Tokengated Commerce](https://www.notboring.co/p/tokengated-commerce?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0NjkxMjA4OSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NTMxNTkyODYsIl8iOiJSSnFQaCIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTUwMTYwMywiZXhwIjoxNjUxNTA1MjAzLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMTAwMjUiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.SUd1yV_bVySDF3oItpvsNG0eNLwdiqKdVxeo4ehH_pU&s=r) and I would highly recommend it for anyone wanting to dive a little deeper. Fundamentally, they discuss how crypto has always been about what you can do and NFTs, what you can own, but there is something more at play here and that is who you can become.\n\nOwnership of an NFT has often been associated with identity but this concept has the potential to play a much bigger role in our daily lives than just being a member of the latest cool trend. NFTs [represent](https://www.web3.university/tracks/build-your-first-nft) a new file format, our digital social identities are rapidly growing and for the first time this measure of culture and community can be neatly packaged in a way that can be just as easily interpreted by computers as it can be by people.\n\nWe humans are tribalistic beings, we long for belonging and to be a part of something. As owners of NFTs we will be people with [wallets](https://metamask.io/) and these wallets can be connected to discord channels, dapps and marketplaces as a means of communicating said identity. \"NFTs are a new token of meaning on the internet for 'fit in, and stand out', one of the most important raw ingredients for so many wonderful things in the world - culture, community, commerce\" says Alex who is working on what he refers to as Tokengated Commerce, taking this idea of signifying community membership and applying it to consumer experiences. \n\nIn the form of digital art NFTs are an output of commerce but following this they can evolve to be an input for commerce. Imagine shopping online but when you connect your wallet the retailer’s platform responds in a way that acknowledges you. This recognition has the power to be leveraged in a way that promotes inclusion far beyond any of the loyalty programs we see currently. The ‘gated’ aspect will gamify the experience to an extent as well, making certain products or real life experiences unlockable dependent on your identity, we have seen the beginning of this already with [Coachella](https://nft.coachella.com/bloom) utilising rare flower NFTs for specific area access, redemption mechanisms for products and other rare experiences.  In his [Three Stages of Adoption](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ftx_the-three-stages-of-nft-adoption-a-hypothesis-ugcPost-6925816246831603712-bjsB/?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=android_app), FTX’s Trystan Yver describes how this idea of owning digital items that tie back to real life things in particular is how we will onboard the next wave of adopters. The combination of an increasingly personalised experience and one that plays to scarcity by limiting access and creating a challenge for consumers is one that will have a dramatic impact on everyone in the transition to [web3](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blockchain-coming-together-says-berners-200956278.html).\n\n![Source: 2022 In Bloom FTX NFT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZXGFl5jJLSiPwg9zxyzNC.png?height=632&width=744)\n\n**Identification and Verification**\n\nWhat makes NFTs so special is their ability to act as a digital identifier that can be controlled using the integrated smart contracts. This in particular is a benefit that can offer wide ranging practical use for individuals in every walk of life. Medical records and personal identification documents being the most obvious. Both of which are traditionally difficult to access and even harder to replace. Putting the control back into the hands of the individual as opposed to the large health institutions would increase confidentiality and allow the individual to dictate the specific information shared when seeking treatment without disclosing personal data that they wish to keep private.\n\nAnything that is unique can be represented digitally and secured to an NFT. Although the most common use for these special tokens has been in the mediums of digital rarities like artwork and collectibles, their ability to act as a digital representation for something could be extended to even us humans. \n\nAs adoption increases, we could occupy a world where an individual is issued an NFT birth certificate. Inextricably linked to the individual, this could be the start of establishing a digital record of identification and form the basis for which to link medical records that can be tracked in NFT form. \n\nA similar principle of identification can be applied to products within the manufacturing process. Take car manufacturing for example, by linking each individual part with a non fungible signature, which could be as simple as a QR code, the automotive supply chain would allow the manufacturer to trace the components in a way that in the event of a recall, could save the company billions if dollars each year by reducing the number of vehicles that would need to be recalled. \n\nWarehouse administration is another aspect of the supply chain that has the potential for radical increase in efficiency through the new standards blockchain enables. Inaccurate inventory can be costly for companies and we know all too well the scope for human error in conventional databases. By incorporating a digital identity that can move with the physical item we reduce the inventory related inaccuracies and increase the authenticity of the original, something that is becoming apparent in the luxury goods industry. \n\nLouis Vuitton [announced](https://www.euronews.com/culture/2022/02/19/fashion-and-blockchain-how-louis-vuitton-and-friends-are-digitising-your-threads) plans to use an NFT optimised supply chain to identify their goods and provide increased transparency throughout the products manufacturing process, adding to the uniqueness and quality. In the past five years we have seen a clear shift in sustainably focused firms and transparency has been a big driver in the promotion of this. As the luxury brands pave the way for what is possible, in the future we may see this authenticity flow down to some more accessible daily products such as clothing or coffee, where us consumers feel strongly about transparency in the entire supply chain process.\n\n![Source: Blockchain in Procurement and Supply Chain](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GjcUD4fEjtufdB9Oi6pM4.png?height=415&width=877)\n\nThe above are mere examples of things that can be easily integrated onto the blockchain via digital twins. Taking this concept of ownership verification there are a plethora of assets with historically clunky proof of ownership systems that we can apply this ideology to. Traditionally, conducting high value asset transactions digitally was uncommon. The process of buying a house can be a stressful experience for most lucky enough to experience it. Consisting of a long winded process with multiple parties involved in substantial paperwork facilitating the deed transfer. The smart contracts that underpin NFTs would allow this asset class and many others that have been notoriously illiquid, to be tokenised and traded as easily as you would trade a cryptocurrency. \n\nMarx Rowan, chief executive officer of Apollo Global Management Inc. said in an episode of “[Bloomberg Wealth with David Rubenstein](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/the-blockworks-group_apollo-ceo-500-billion-aum-on-the-potential-ugcPost-6929371971033956352-xkmL?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=android_app).” “Many of the rails or the technology or the platforms or the systems that support what’s happening in NFT are actually the precursor to changes in our financial system and we ignore them at our peril.” \n\nWork In Fintech's very own [Benyamin Ahmed](https://twitter.com/ObiWanBenoni), NFT [millionaire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abPmJwXan9c) at 12 years old and the youngest ever guest [lecturer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHUWaLcLau8) at Oxford University, will be talking more about digital identities and looking at how this generational shift will propel society further into the digital universe at [NFT.NYC](https://www.nft.nyc/). \n\nFollow [Work In Fintech](https://workinfintech.com/) for more information and to stay up to date as this new technology continues to shape our world.\n\n \n  \n ", "timestamp": 1653245732, "digest": "mQi4RkO97g8cqCnVunD_9kcBoskYxAx3ZC8YDS6ag44", "contributor": "0xcb1dad8Eb819F5E4AFD54284050aCE97Ca900464"}

Jesus, Grayson. What strength?” came his sister’s voice through the phone.\n\nGrayson squinted through the dawn sun at the bottle of pills he had grabbed from his bedside table: *Losonil. Memory Loss. For A Sound Mind.* “Extra Strength… 1 year.”\n\n“I knew it! Just like all the other cowards!”\n\n“Sis, please. There’s nothing?”\n\n“Nothing. You left nothing. You told me nothing. There’s no fucking note. The gall. After everything you’ve said.”\n\n“Everything I said?”\n\n“You haven’t even read the news yet haven’t you? Go fuck yourself. No wonder she left you.”\n\nClick.\n\nSilence.\n\nStealing himself from the dizzy desire to expel whatever food he ate last night, Grayson swiped past a year’s worth of missing data on his phone to open the browser. He took a deep breath and opened the headlines.\n\n*Private Message Leak Continues to Wreak Havoc.*\n\n*Who Is The Hacker? Search Continues.*\n\n*Never Reader Groups Protest Face2Face Offices.*\n\n*Calls for Social Debt Jubilee Rises.*\n\n*New York Opens Additional Mental Health Clinics.*\n\n*Layoffs at Face2Face Continue.*\n\n*Bank CEOs Say That Their Money Is Safe.*\n\nAs Grayson scrolled through the news, the pieces fell into place.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a hack of Face2Face was revealed. By breaking the encryption through an unknown method, about a year’s worth of private messages and location data from a billion people were collected by a hacker, and leaked. Almost immediately, as the world verified the truth of it, the fallout began. At a college party in Georgetown the beer pong and loud EDM turned down to hushes. A woman left an apartment in Cape Town with all her belongings in a box, slamming the door in the face of her now ex-boyfriend. A woman in Dubai called her sister in Mumbai to ask if she knew about their father. A Hong Kong man threw xiaolongbao at his friend, asking him why he lied about the money. In Sydney, a friend texted another friend wondering why they were always so afraid to share the truth of how they felt towards each other. In Buenos Aires, a woman cried and kissed a fading picture of her husband after learning the truth about his death. A father in Reykjavik cried over hearing his daughter’s last, joyful voice notes sent to her friends before the accident.\n\nAt first, it was all individual stories of pain, guilt, and frustration, but also of joy, release, and closure. New connections and disconnections. But, then, the fallout snowballed into groups: Never Readers, Forgivers, and Transparenters to name a few. Never Readers resisted the temptation and vowed to stay with the true intent. They wished to not violate the consent of those who discussed things in private. The Never Readers had its own sub-groups, with one side going with the flow (the Flow Nevers). Their belief was: it happened, it doesn’t need to be read, and that’s okay. The other (the Never Evers), vowed to destroy the dataset through any means possible. It was an abomination and a temptation that had to be forever erased.\n\nThe Forgivers read the dataset, but vowed to accept the true nature of humanity. None of us were perfect after all: we bad mouth others, cheat, and lie. Now that the truth was out: we forgive and move on. However, the Transparenters were a bit more radical: believing that this represented a new reality and evolution for society. We should all be transparent with all our thoughts with everyone around us. It was telepathy, a way to grow collectively, and to erase the harm of the ego.\n\nThe world economy also fell off a cliff. Not only did most people stop using social media, but it was uncertain whether any technology was reliably encrypted: the entire bedrock of the world economy. It faltered, with group CEOs of the Fortune 500 coming together to issue a statement saying that while investigations continue, they believe it was only an issue at Face2Face. The hacker was also still on the loose, having managed to hide their tracks. It was then that Grayson checked his phone again. He couldn’t log into his Face2Face work email. Smearing his hands through his face as if it would somehow paint back a year’s worth of memories, he ghosted towards the kitchen and rang his colleague. Inside the fridge was a sandwich with a note to himself: “This is the only thing you get. Sorry. - Grayson”.\n\nAs he inspected it, his colleague answered. “Grayson? Yo. What’s up?”\n\nBiting off a mouthful of egg and bacon, and briefly pausing with it in his mouth, Grayson responded. “Rick…”\n\n“Grayson?”\n\n“Rick…”\n\n“Oh shit. Fuck. G. You didn’t? You promised!”\n\nSwallowing more of the sandwich, Grayson replied with a clearer voice. “I did. Rick. Holy shit. Please tell me I told you something?”\n\n“Well, fuck. This is not good-”\n\n“Why did I take it? Wait, why?”\n\n“Shit, this is not good. Shit. Shit. Okay-”\n\n“Rick, what’s going on?”\n\n“Where are you? At your apartment?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“They are coming today. Meet me at Dawns in thirty. We can’t talk about this over the phone.”\n\nGrayson pulled back his phone to check the day of the week. It was Monday. “I don’t have a job anymore, do I?”\n\n“Right on, dickhead. I don’t either. See you soon. I’ll explain.”\n\nClick.\n\nSilence.\n\nGrayson wolfed down the rest of his breakfast sandwich and jumped into the shower. When the condensation evaporated he saw a self he did not remember: neat haircut, chiseled abs, and a smooth face. After a short walk, he arrived at Dawns to the smell of coffee, breakfast, and a hint of newly cleaned floors. Scanning the room, a wave from a table in the corner greeted him and he hesitantly walked over amidst a TV blaring the news.\n\n“Yeah, I’ve let go a bit from when you last would remember me. It’s been tough on everyone,” Rick said as Grayson sat down.\n\n“What’s going on?”\n\n“We were all fired. Most of Face2Face got fired. But, since then, our team has been placed under investigation and-”\n\n“They think we did it?” Grayson asked as the waitress arrived.\n\n“We’ll just have some coffee. Thank you,” Rick replied before turning back to Grayson.\n\n“Actually, hang on,” Grayson said, turning towards the waitress before she left. “Can you turn down the TV? It’s a bit much.” She frowned a bit and then nodded affirmatively before heading to the kitchen. “Continue”, he said to Rick.\n\n“Yes, so, yeah. They think we did it. And our lawyers were coming today to take statements to bolster our case. Taking Losonil *the* day before, do you know what that looks like?”\n\n“Yes, I’m not stupid.”\n\n“Then why Grayson?! Are you sure you left no note?”\n\n“Nothing besides my other self leaving me a sandwich, nope. And if there’s one thing I know about myself. I won’t leave myself a fucking treasure hunt.”\n\nRick sighed after a sip of coffee. “Dude. Okay. Well. The lawyers are still coming today… Just tell them the truth, please. And when you can, please check the leaked database. Anything will help our case, even if you took Losonil. Have you looked at the dataset at all?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“About two months in, we switched all our internal comms to exclusively use Face2Face internally. It’s all there. Maybe there’s something in there that will help us.” Grayson was silent as he sipped his coffee. “You’re not going to reply to that? After all we’ve been through?”\n\n“Rick. Relax. I just lost a year of my life. I don’t have a job anymore. The world is in chaos. We’re apparently under investigation? It’s not even obvious that combing through this dataset will actually help us. I also apparently had a girlfriend that left me? None of this makes sense at all. Rick-”\n\n“I know, I know,” Rick replied, catching his breath. “Just. Anything will help at this point.”\n\n“You think someone on our team did it?”\n\n“I didn’t think so, but with more of the team taking Losonil…”\n\n“Who else did?”\n\n“Li did. Aphiwe did… Your ex also. Allison.”\n\n“Is… is that why we broke up? When did she join the team? Do you have a picture of us?”\n\nRick pulled out of his phone, opened his photos and started scrolling through it. Grayson put down his coffee and leaned across the table. Before Rick could get to a photo he suddenly closed his phone.\n\n“You know what. No,” Rick suddenly responded. “Stop changing the subject.” Grayson pulled back in his seat frowning at his friend. “You broke your promise. How can I actually trust you after this?”\n\n“Who is she, Rick?! What did she do to me?!” Grayson shouted at his old friend, yanking the phone from his hand.\n\nRick stole his phone back and stood up. “So close Grayson. So close. You actually were so close to changing for the better.” Rick left towards the door.\n\n“I’m just looking for answers!”\n\n“Everyone is, asshole. Can’t even say sorry. Maybe stop looking elsewhere for your answers,” Rick shouted into Dawns before exiting into the morning outside.\n\nThe waitress returned and asked if he was sure he didn’t want some food. He nodded no, downed the coffee, dropped some dollars on the table and left. Outside, he lit a cigarette as a faceless crowd with placards mobbed towards the local park. The only part of their chant he could hear was “Face 2 Face”. Staring into the road as if it hid the answers from him, he took a deep draw of the cigarette and turned the other way back towards his apartment.\n\nWhen he arrived, two men in suits and briefcases were waiting for him next to a statue of a bird he did not recall buying. Grayson straightened himself and walked towards them.\n\n“Mr. Cave. It’s me, Austin, and this is my colleague, whom you’ve also met, Gerard. How are you?”\n\n“Good, and you can call me Grayson,” as he shook their hands and led them inside. As they opened up their tablets on the kitchen table, Grayson interrupted. “Listen. I’m going to make this easy on you. I took Losonil last night. A year’s worth.”\n\nThey kept typing, and then suddenly stopped. “Wait. Can you repeat that?”\n\n“Gerard, right?” Grayson asked as he pointed at the one with the balding head. “I don’t remember you. I took Losonil. Should I say it again?”\n\n“You took Losonil right before we could help you? Why?”\n\n“If I knew why, it wouldn’t be a memory loss pill, now would it?”\n\n“Are you insane?!”\n\nAustin, the one with the big glasses, shifted in his seat, “...okay, guys. Relax.”\n\n“He took Losonil. The day before taking statements. What are we doing here?”\n\nGrayson offered a solution. “Look, if you can figure out why, then we both win, no?”\n\nClosing his tablet, Gerard stood up and started searching through the apartment.\n\n“You could’ve just asked,” Grayson responded to the lawyer going through his stuff.\n\n“Sorry about that,” Austin chimed in.\n\n“It’s fine. There’s no treasure hunt here. I would’ve made it more obvious.”\n\n“Do you mind if we go through your apartment? We’re here to help.”\n\nGrayson looked at Gerard scanning in between stacked books. “Your partner is already doing so. Go ahead.” As much as he hoped that they might find something, he let out a sigh of relief when they finally left with nothing in hand.\n\nAs soon as the door closed behind them, Grayson downloaded the leaked dataset. Amidst the general chatter of tasks and project management comms from his old team, he found her full name: *Allison Bleicher*. He copy-pasted it into the dataset’s search bar and for a moment hesitated before he hit search. A warmth rose up in him and he went to the kitchen to pour a glass of water first. He took a deep breath and hit enter.\n\nThere she was. A beautiful dark-haired woman with blue eyes and a button nose. She was into birds, running, cryptography, and old French films. His hands started shaking as he entered both their names into the search bar. *Allison Bleicher. Grayson Cave.*\n\nHe lurched at the life he won’t ever get back again. They were in love. He effortlessly said all the right things. They were very much in love. He kept scrolling through the early days of their relationship until he halted at a picture of her in lacey lingerie. He moved his chair back, and then suddenly closed his computer. After pacing around in his apartment, he opened the dataset again and entered his own name.\n\nThe past 365 days actually went well. Even went to the gym more often. He pulled up his shirt and felt his abs again. He tapped his nails on his laptop, shook his head, and typed in their names again. The lacey lingerie photo appeared again. With a deep breath he kept scrolling until the photos shared between them undressed themselves to her naked body. The cursor inched closer and hovered over her hips and her breasts. He had responded with his own warm, sunset nude.\n\n*>>* I’m the luckiest man in the world. :heart-eyes-emoji:. You have a body that belongs in a gallery for all the world to see.\n\n<< :winky-face-emoji: We’ll both be on those pedestals one day. For now though. You know where to find me…\n\nThe next message was 16 minutes later.\n\n*>>* I’m outside.\n\nThe next message was a few hours later.\n\n<< Thanks for last night. You’re welcome to apply for a membership pass to this gallery. :winky-face-emoji:\n\nAs he continued scrolling through their relationship, it was all positive messages of affirmation and love. Despite seeing the body of a woman he once shared, what made him choke up the most was hearing her voice: a kind, happy, and gentle voice. One such voice note, left during a humid summer’s day on her way to the grocery store, left her slightly out of breath after listing the ingredients for their dinner. The cicadas sang in the background. As it got closer to the date of the leak, Grayson’s heart kept beating faster. And then, all of a sudden, it ended.\n\n*>>* You are so obsessed with your work. You changed. I can’t anymore. We have to talk.\n\nA week later, the leak was revealed. He logged onto Face2Face to find his account still active, living in a ghost town. All other social media too. In the wake of the hack, 80% of users deleted their accounts. The Allison Bleicher of today was nowhere to be seen. Her number was still in the database, however. He called it.\n\nA dead tone.\n\nHe sighed and called Rick.\n\nIt rang.\n\nIt rang.\n\nIt went to voicemail.\n\n“Hey. Rick. Sorry about this morning. Can we talk? The lawyers were here. I let them look through my apartment. They found nothing. I still know nothing. I’ve looked at the database, but it would really help if I could ask you some questions. Call me.”\n\nClick.\n\nSilence.\n\nHe sighed, ordered some Chinese takeaway, and searched online for any news about leases. It confirmed what he wanted to know: many people had moved after the dataset leaked. There were fresh calls from congress to consider a lease jubilee, allowing anyone to exit without penalties. He started typing in Allison’s name in the search bar alongside the request to display all associated locations. His hand hovered over the “Enter” button, but he pulled back, and slammed his fist into the table to noodles and chopsticks flinging out from his takeaway.\n\nHe recalled his conversations today. His sister shouting at him: “*Who do you think you are?!*” Rick telling him to: “*...maybe stop looking elsewhere for your answers*”, and Allison’s last message to him: “*...you’ve changed*”. In his notepad, he scribbled: *Who am I?*\n\nIn the dataset, he searched for all mentions of himself. Rumours, whispers, and messages from people orbiting his life. Unlike some people who discovered newfound loneliness after discovering that no one ever talked about them, Grayson found plenty of chatter. It crossed the scope of the human condition.\n\nFrom the good:\n\n“Grayson is a great candidate! Definitely send the offer letter.”\n\n“Yeah, Grayson is also coming. He usually makes this kickass cocktail. Also, knows a shit-ton about obscure poetry. You’ll love him.”\n\n“I miss Grayson, man. Wish he didn’t move.”\n\nTo sexual, “Did you see Grayson’s abs lately? The thirst traps on Face2Face. Um. Yum.”\n\nBut, most of it was negative.\n\n“Why are you still dating him? Does he even listen?”\n\n“Can’t we do something? He literally hogs all the meetings?”\n\n“Can’t you call him? Please, he’s just gonna gaslight me again.”\n\n“Is Grayson coming? He sometimes gets just so abrasive when he’s had a few drinks.”\n\nHe searched for any open source tools that would allow him to get a bigger picture. Not a lot existed, but there were open source libraries for people who wanted to run sentiment analysis on people: insert your name and you would get a word cloud of positive and negative associations. Another interesting one: the serendipity maximizer. It went through the dataset and determined the person in the dataset that would be the most unlikely person that you should’ve met in your life. All those strange coincidences that should’ve happened, but never did. It reminded him of a conversation with Allison that he read a few hours earlier.\n\n<< G. Isn’t it weird that through all of time and space, we managed to meet?\n\n*>>* Life is weird, yeah. A wonderful coincidence. Serendipity at its finest.\n\n<< No, but like specifically. What are the actual odds? If I didn’t meet Skye at that party, so many things would’ve been different. We would never have been put in touch. I wish I knew.\n\n*>>* We would’ve met. I’m sure of it.\n\nWhen he entered his name into the serendipity maximizer, it popped up a name that, as expected, he had never heard of: *Hel Witte*. Grayson frowned as he browsed through what was available of Hel’s life. Seemingly quite active, socially, but only a few photos of others in his life. Although they were supposed to have met, with their apparent coincidental proximity, they haven’t. He scribbled in his notebook: *“Come back to Hel Witte…”*\n\nGrayson kept searching for more open source libraries, but didn’t find any of use. There was one thing he was now after and it was in the notebook, encircled with more thoughts.\n\n*“Who am I? -> I am not myself. I’m the stories in everyone else’s heads. I’m not one person. I’m a composite self. I am many.”*\n\nSo, after hours of work, the sun already having set, he combined the serendipity maximizer and the sentiment analytical tool to create a new tool: one that would create a composite self. It was the combination of what everyone said, influenced and embedded into the social graph of his life. Those closest to him had the highest impacts and weak connections elsewhere had less. When combined, would see his full and real self. After the data crunched, the bright screen in the dark night illuminated the question Grayson was after. There he was, the real complex, messy Grayson. It was an indescribable mirror that suddenly forced tears into his eyes. It was his younger self that felt the joy, the one that was always bullied for misunderstanding. It was his younger self that didn’t have the luxury to know what needed to be done before he was punished for being clueless. All those selves pushed tears into his face, blurring the composite self on the screen into what he always wanted to see. He understood himself. Despite this joy, there was a part of himself that glowed dark: his utter selfishness. It wasn’t long before that consumed him again.\n\nHis notebook had collected a new scribble: *“If you could know your composite self and see everything that influenced it, could you manipulate it?”*\n\nBased on his model of the composite self, he determined possible ways that one could manipulate it. Some actions were more powerful. For example, initial impressions and first mentions had a strong halo effect: it lasted very long. Additionally, it seemed that manipulating the social graph itself would also alter his composite self. New people that entered a social circle would drastically alter the composite selves of everyone they directly touched, even to second and third degrees of separation. After he ranked the actions to their strengths, he polled through the dataset to see if there were any instances where these strong manipulative actions clustered unexpectedly. Somewhere in the early morning, energy drink in hand and new stubble on his face, his stomach lurched again - and it wasn’t from missing dinner.\n\nSomeone had indeed been using these strong manipulative methods to alter their composite selves, and it was a name he’d seen before: *Hel Witte*. A man he had never known that was his highest serendipity match: someone who he should’ve met in his life, but never did. With what space was left in his notebook, he wrote in bold: *“COULD THIS BE THE HACKER? WHO IS HEL WITTE?!”*\n\nGrayson put Hel Witte’s name into Face2Face, and there he was, not deleted. An anomaly.\n\nOpening up the messenger, Grayson shakingly typed: “Hey?”\n\nHis heart pounded as the person on the other end was typing …\n\n<< Hey Grayson. I knew this might happen.\n\n*>>* What? I don’t understand?\n\n<< Do you want to know who I am?\n\n*>>* Yes.\n\n<< Then this was the only way. Trust me. Come find me here.\n\n<Location Pin Shared\\*>\\*\n\n*>>* Who are you?\n\nThere was no further reply. Entering the pin on Face2Face Maps revealed a location a short drive away in an old warehouse. His eyes darted around, uncertain if this was a memory he was supposed to remember. He entered this location, and Hel Witte into the dataset. Nothing for the latter, but the location popped up occasionally, precisely for what it seemed to be: a seemingly empty warehouse. Squinting at the screen, hoping that it would reveal who Hel Witte was, Grayson called Rick again.\n\nIt rang.\n\nIt rang.\n\nIt rang. Click. Silence. No voicemail.\n\nHe took a deep breath and searched for his name alongside his sister. There, in a message to a co-worker, was the Grayson that his sister rejected.\n\n<< This firewall bug feels like my ex, lol. Seemingly impenetrable, but if you push the right button, it all falls down.\n\n*>>* I know the feeling. Sounds like my sister, tbh. So scared of life that she feels compelled to lash out at everything with even the slightest breeze against her. Makes her a bit of a bitch.\n\nHe called her.\n\nIt rang.\n\nIt rang.\n\nIt rang. It went to voicemail.\n\n“Hey, this is Steph. I’m not at the phone right now. Please leave a message if you are the kind of person who likes to leave a message. Voice notes are also fine. Okay, bye.”\n\n“Hey, sis. I’m sorry about what I said. I truly am. I found the messages I wrote. Can I make it up to you? I’ll bring you some key lime pie? Listen. I need to know something. Do you know a Hel Witte? The dataset says you do? Call me back when you can, please.”\n\nWhen Grayson put the phone down, he realised partly why no one was answering. It was 5:12 AM. He looked towards his bed and towards his apartment door. After a deep breath, he threw on some warmer clothes, picked up his keys, and jumped into his car to the radio blaring an early morning talk show on the hack. He turned it off and drove towards the warehouse.\n\nOn the highway, the first signs of the dawn gradient painted itself on the horizon. It was cold and fresh as the Sisyphean sun swept the night away. Alongside ads for injury lawyers, a billboard stood out: “God always knew everything. Repent, forgive, and trust Him.”\n\nWhen Grayson arrived at the warehouse and turned off the rumbling engine, the silence rang in his ears. The only noise was the distant highway and early planes jetting consultants off to cities elsewhere.\n\nA door into the warehouse was ajar with a light clawing into the yard. He edged closer as the crunchy cold dust pierced underneath his boots through the morning silence. Peering around the door’s frame, he suddenly winced back when he saw about ten silhouettes inside. He tried to slow down his breath, but his heart felt like a kick drum, booming away.\n\nNothing. He heard nothing. Peering back around the frame, holding his gaze, he saw that the silhouettes weren’t moving. He inched in and his eyes acclimated to the static crowd in front of him. It was cardboard cutouts with question marks on them. Frowning, he moved through the crowd to a tiny table at the back of the warehouse. On it, was a phone plugged into a power outlet. He picked it up and it instantly recognized his face, unlocking it.\n\nShaking and dizzy, he picked up the phone to see that there was one text file on it that simply said: README. He tapped on it, and it prompted for a password. He tried some of his own passwords, but none worked. Looking around, he found nothing that could indicate that there was a password nearby. Grayson tried recalling parts of what he had read about Hel Witte. He tried a bunch of long shots, to no avail. His stomach churned after not having had dinner, taking him back to the sandwich he left himself the day before. Frowning, Grayson typed: “This is the only thing you get. Sorry. - Grayson.”\n\nIt opened and the first sentence took his breath away.\n\n“Hey Grayson. I knew this might happen. Hel Witte isn’t real. I created him. Or, *we*, created him. I am your other self. I left this letter to you. You hacked Face2Face and you leaked the dataset. I’ll tell you why, and I’ll tell you why I took Losonil.”\n\nGrayson fell to his knees as he rested his back against the table legs before continuing to read the letter he wrote to himself.\n\n“By the fact that you found this letter, it tells me that what I might tell you, won’t be new. It all started a month into your memory loss. By accident you discovered a serious vulnerability in the key generation of Face2Face’s encryption. This also affected end-to-end encryption. The possibilities were intoxicating. For so many years, you’ve felt misunderstood, and this meant that maybe, finally, you could get out of your rut and understand so many more things: yourself, the world, and others. You didn’t hesitate.\n\n“During this initial data gathering phase, Allison joined the team. At first, there was light playful attention between you and her, but when it didn’t go further, you saw it as the perfect time to finally use the power you had at your fingertips. Slowly, but surely, learning who she was, you changed yourself and said exactly the right things. It worked, and you grew closer. Once the relationship worked, the desire did not go away. It burned in you, to know more. Delusions of grandeur spiraled and you knew that the most important project you could do, was to perfect the use of this dataset to your benefit. You always wanted to know yourself, and now you could. You saw, in real-time, how the dataset moved and morphed: words, messages, and actions spiraling into new connections and disconnections. In order to gain power over this beast, you had to know yourself. So, you built the composite self: a combined person of all the people you are to others.\n\n“Many variables were involved, including yourself, where others were in the social graph, what they said about you, and where they were. That moment you first saw your full self, you were in ecstasy. And then, you became all powerful. You could see how any and all actions in your circle affected you. And so, with your composite self, you started crafting the version you wanted to be. By saying the right things at the right time, and introducing the right people to each other, you saw in real time how your composite self improved. But, your hubris got the best of you. All of this manipulation started seeping into the people around you. Allison left you because you became consumed by altering your composite self. At first, with her leaving, it even improved your composite self because she blocked you. Slowly, but surely, the feedback loop went into the wrong direction. You increasingly manipulated yourself, even to the point of personal abuse.\n\n“When the composite self didn’t change the way you wanted it to, you even punished yourself. In your wake was not just a self destroyed, but also the wreckage of many broken relationships. It all came to a head when the woman who was there for you, for all your life, was ostracized to improve your self image. After you sent that message to your sister, the cracks of the composite self appeared and you came face to face with yourself.\n\n“Staring ever deeper into this abyss, drunk on creating a new you, you saw the real Grayson that was led to this point: a Grayson that just needed self-love. You didn’t need to manipulate yourself into a perfect you, you just had to accept what you’ve done and who you’ve become. You are just human, Grayson. Flawed, like everyone else. Just a human that tries to do good with the world that forced them into the spaces and times they weren’t ready for. From the brink, however, you could see the void that awaited others and humanity if this power was left unchecked: an undetectable human with vast manipulative power. If they didn’t have a filter, the world would never be the same.\n\n“The entire system had to be nuked. By leaking the dataset, trust in private communications on social media would evaporate. It would be costly for society, but worth it. You, however, would still be a broken God. While you would save humanity from a potential disaster, you achieved an epiphany at the cost of the lives of others. You manipulated the people around you to arrive at this point. You had to atone to truly deserve this epiphany. You could’ve asked for forgiveness, but it would be meaningless without the entire truth that you were the hacker. That wasn’t a cost you would then consider to bear. And so, the most meaningful atonement would be merely to forget the epiphany. You would take Losonil and delete as much of this past year from your life as you can.\n\n“However, I knew that there was a possibility that having forgotten this entire year, I would follow the same path without the lesson I had learned. Even though the dataset wouldn’t be real time anymore and people would stop using private social media, I was afraid you would somehow continue down a dark path and cause more destruction again in your wake. I still had a duty to stop that from happening, and so instead of just leaving a note on your bedside table, I would only intervene if you arrived at the same conclusion: that a dataset like this would be used to manipulate others. I moved many of the manipulations I did in the past year and split it into a fake person: *Hel Witte*. By baiting your curiosity, I knew if you arrived at Hel Witte, I’d be able to get you out here and share the truth with you. You know yourself, but not nearly as well as you think you do. The faceless crowd in this room is there to help you answer the question that’s been plaguing you, your entire life.\n\n*Who am I?*\n\nRather, the question should be. *Who are we not?*\n\nWhile you now know the full truth again, you’re back where you started. You’ve failed. It’s time to truly atone.\n\nI love you, asshole.”\n\nThe screen turned black and he saw himself briefly in the reflection before a choice appeared.\n\n“In five minutes, the phone will notify the press of your hack, the way it happened, and why you did it. *Or*, you can cancel this countdown and erase the phone. I know what I would do, do you?”", "timestamp": 1653245793, "digest": "g6Ugf8LFFYLmjei4otUckKjvfPRNiIkqeVyvtmjPlCQ", "contributor": "0x4086583a20335BA5a333547b6D5327aD6e002261"}

The total amount of refunded compensation was nearly 80million yuan, and the Simba Kwai account number was permanently closed.\n\nOn May 11, the relevant person in charge of Henan Consumer Association declined the interview with e-Law of Finance and economics. The relevant person in charge of Simba team introduced the main dispute focus in the trial.\n\nSpecifically include: whether Henan consumer association can put forward the lawsuit claim of “refund one compensation three”; Whether the company involved should jointly bear the responsibility of “one refund and three compensation”, and if necessary, how to calculate the amount of refund and compensation that should be borne by all parties; Whether there is a legal basis for permanently shutting down Simba and its companies’ live studio accounts; Whether Henan Consumer Association has performed its public welfare duties before litigation.\n\nAs a new form of e-commerce rising in recent years, the introduction, display and publicity of products brought by live broadcasting have broken through the regulatory scope of laws and regulations such as advertising law. At present, a series of laws and regulations have been issued, including the code of conduct for webcast marketing, the measures for the supervision and administration of online transactions and the measures for the administration of webcast marketing (for Trial Implementation). The regulatory authorities have also launched special rectification actions to make it clear that “the problem of illegal and illegal profits shall be strictly dealt with”, including the false publicity of marketing goods.\n\nIn the view of Ma Xiangxiang, partner of Beijing Anjie law firm, “there is a complete and mature rule system for live broadcasting with goods. However, in specific practice, relevant subjects need to comply with the requirements of laws and regulations”. She pointed out that a remarkable feature of digital economic governance is multiple collaborative governance. Therefore, consumer organizations, industry associations and other institutions should play an important role in the supervision and governance of live broadcasting and goods.\n\nTherefore, the lawsuit initiated by Henan Consumer Association is known as the first public interest litigation case of live delivery of goods. All parties believe that this case is of great significance to the normative development of this emerging industry.\n\n01\n\nThe whole story of “false bird’s nest incident”\n\nAt the end of October 2020, consumers pointed out that the bird’s nest sold by Simba’s anchor “Shida Meili” in the live studio was actually sugar water. On November 27 of the same year, Simba issued a letter of apology, saying that when the involved “Mingzhi” bird’s nest products were promoted and sold in the live broadcasting room, “there was indeed exaggerated publicity, and the ingredient of bird’s nest was less than 2G per bowl”. Simba put forward the “first compensation scheme”, recalled all the “Mingzhi” brand bird’s nest products sold in Xinxuan live studio, and promised to refund one for three.\n\nOn December 23 of the same year, the Guangzhou municipal market supervision bureau reported the investigation and handling situation and planned to impose an administrative penalty of ordering Guangzhou Heyi e-commerce Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Guangzhou Heyi”), the founder of the live broadcasting room involved, to stop the illegal act and impose a fine of 900000 yuan. Guangzhou Rongyu Trading Co., Ltd., the main seller of goods involved in the case, was ordered to stop the illegal act and fined 2 million yuan.\n\nOn the same day, the official microblog of Kwai e-commerce also announced that after the incident, the brand’s bird’s nest products were taken off the shelves of Kwai e-commerce in the whole station, and the e-commerce function of “Shida Meili” account was banned for 14 days; Xin Youzhi (Simba), the person in charge of Heyi in Guangzhou to which the anchor belongs, was required to properly deal with the after-sales problems and cooperate with the investigation of relevant departments. The live broadcast of Xin Youzhi’s personal account was suspended from November 17.\n\nThe announcement also said that according to the investigation and handling by the Guangzhou municipal market supervision bureau, Kwai e-commerce decided to take further measures: from now on, the account of “Shida Meili” will be closed for 60 days; Close Xin Youzhi’s personal account for 60 days. In addition, the accounts of 27 e-commerce anchors of Guangzhou Heyi and its affiliated companies were closed for 15 days, and the company was required to organize their e-commerce anchors for relevant training and learning.\n\nHowever, the incident did not end here. In August, 2021, Henan consumers’ Association filed a civil public interest lawsuit against Kwai company, Simba and related companies, requiring them to jointly bear the liability of “one refund and three compensation” and joint and several liability, with a total amount of 79.714156 million yuan.\n\nIn January 2022, after the lawsuit was disclosed, Xinxuan group announced that after the “bird’s nest incident”, it had put forward an advance compensation scheme on November 27, 2020, that is, recalling the products of the live broadcasting room and promising to refund one for three. As of January 14, 2022, the company has paid a total of 41.439 million yuan to consumers, and the compensation scheme is still valid.\n\n02\n\nDoes the consumer association have the right to file public interest litigation?\n\nHenan Consumer Association said in the indictment that at the end of December 2020, Henan Consumer Association successively received consumer complaints and complaints. The bird’s nest purchased in Simba live studio had problems and was suspected of cheating consumers. After investigation and verification, it is determined that it infringes on many unspecified consumers (including 2124 transaction notes in Henan Province, with a total transaction amount of 601000 yuan). Henan Consumer Association believes that this incident infringed on the legitimate rights and interests of many unspecified consumers, caused serious damage to social and public interests, and met the legal conditions for filing consumer civil public interest litigation.\n\nAccording to the interpretation of the Supreme People’s Court on Several Issues concerning the application of law in the trial of consumer civil public interest litigation cases (revised in 2020) (hereinafter referred to as the interpretation of consumer civil public interest litigation), which came into force on January 1, 2021, the conduct of the defendant in filing consumer civil public interest litigation infringes the legitimate rights and interests of many unspecified consumers, or has the potential to endanger the personal Proof materials of preliminary evidence of damage to social and public interests such as property safety risk. For the trial of such cases, the court needs to first review the relevant supporting materials submitted by the local consumer association.\n\nAccording to the previous public information, Simba took the initiative to announce the first Refund Scheme of “one refund and three compensation” on November 27, 2020. Simba said that as of the date of the trial, all consumers who can be contacted by Guangzhou Heyi and meet the refund conditions have been compensated.\n\nThen, the Henan Consumer Association submitted a civil complaint to the Henan intermediate people’s court in August 2021.

{"id": "vwTap7ybXRHxRH32kDGCHSh23i_2zyPWD7p6JOVKdGQ", "title": "Is NFT a big change or real hype?", "body": "The number of words in this article: 3368, about 6 minutes when reading\n\nA mosaic painting sold for 450 million yuan, an ape head for 100 million yuan, and a twitter with five English words for 20 million yuan. The seemingly unimaginable cases are not only people’s expectation of the meta universe, but also the result of the “foam” of the prevalence of market speculation and arbitrage. The risk of scalding should be prevented. The yuan universe in full swing urgently needs to put out the virtual fire and eliminate the turnips.\n\n(Chen Qianling, special commentator of Finance and economics e-Law)\n\nThe meta universe of virtual and real fusion has not yet taken shape, but various magical scenes have occurred frequently in reality.\n\nAt Christie’s auction house, the NFT painting “every day: the first five thousand days” by artist beeple was auctioned, and finally dropped the hammer at a sky high price of US $69.346 million (about 450 million yuan). The work is a digital image composed of 5000 works. In contrast, in the same month, Sotheby’s auction house held the auction of Van Gogh’s masterpiece “Montmartre Street View”, which was sold at a price of 13.091 million euros (about 100 million yuan).\n\nIt sounds puzzling that a pure digital painting is much more expensive than the original work of famous artists.\n\nHowever, it has been proved that beeple’s sky high auction is not an example. In the past two years, the “meta universe works” relying on NFT technology have frequently sold surprisingly high prices——\n\nNBA star curry spent $180000 to buy the “boring monkey” NFT avatar; Sun Yuchen, founder of wave field Tron, took a picture of an ape NFT head for $15 million (about 100 million yuan).\n\nJack Dorsey, the co-founder of twitter, put his first tweet sent out in 2006 on the auction website with only one sentence “just setting up my twttr” and clinched a deal with us $2.9 million (about RMB 18.88 million).\n\nAfter a whole day of fierce competition, the price of the moving picture of “rainbow cat” was finally set at 300 ether coins, which was worth about $560000 at that time.\n\nAll kinds of incredible cases can’t help but make us wonder - why can the works of metauniverse sell at such a high price?\n\n01\n\nWhy are NFT works worth so much money?\n\nFrom the bottom logic, it is people’s optimism and expectation for the complete transformation of the meta universe and the current art market.\n\nWe know that the “value” of works of art lies in its scarcity, emphasizing the exclusivity of the owner in their possession, use, income and disposal. However, in the digital art market, you can easily use and disseminate the works created by the originator in a time-consuming and labor-consuming way by simply “copying” and “pasting”. There are various means of plagiarism, and the problem of authenticity of works is difficult to solve Therefore, the digital art market has failed to open space.\n\nThe “meta universe works” relying on NFT and blockchain technology can solve the key pain points of the traditional digital art market and is expected to burst into vitality no less than that of the traditional art market.\n\nFirst, “protect genuine products”.\n\nThe full English name of NFT is non fungible token, which translates into Chinese: non homogenous token, which is indivisible, irreplaceable and unique. The so-called homogenized token, namely ft (fungible token), can replace and divide each other, that is, there is no difference between an FT in your hand and an FT in mine.\n\nNon homogeneous tokens, namely NFT, are unique and inseparable tokens, and each token is unique. Therefore, mapping the works to the blockchain to generate NFT is equivalent to giving it a unique, authentic and permanent identity, which is the key credential to realize the original authentication, and relying on the tamper proof and traceable blockchain technology, it can realize the real record of the whole process of the subsequent transaction flow information of the works, so as to realize the effective ownership of digital works.\n\nThe second is to “crack down on piracy”.\n\n“Infringement relief difficulty” has always been an important problem perplexing network copyright protection. It is difficult to prove, identify and remedy. Under the meta universe technology, if you suspect that your work has been plagiarized, you can find all relevant information in the blockchain, including the information of the creator, “who created what content at what time”, as well as the relevant information of other subjects’ use and possession of the work. At this time, you can take the relevant records as judicial evidence. This change has undoubtedly greatly reduced the cost of proof for the parties.\n\nThe third is “revenue recovery”.\n\nIn the traditional art trade, once the works are sold, they can only get a one-time return. However, in the form of meta universe, since the transaction link can be executed through smart contract, each transaction can be recorded automatically, which makes it possible for the creator to “get a share” from each subsequent circulation of the work. In the smart contract, the creator can agree on a certain proportion of subsequent revenue sharing, so the payment of each transaction can be automatically withdrawn to his account in each re circulation of the work.\n\nIt can be predicted that with the continuous maturity of metauniverse technologies such as NFT and blockchain, the solution of traditional copyright problems will completely open the digital content market, and the whole links of production, circulation and distribution of works will be reshaped.\n\n02\n\nThe risk of heat to scald needs to be paid attention to\n\nAlthough metacosmic technologies such as NFT have great advantages in stimulating the vitality of original ecology and promoting the reform and innovation of art market, they also have problems and risks that can not be underestimated.\n\nFirst of all, as the saying goes, the ideal is full and the reality is skinny. Although metauniverse has great potential to subvert the digital content market, it is still a long way from the realization of the vision.\n\nTo realize the copyright protection of metacosmic works, the key is to “link the works”. However, as the blockchain technology is not yet fully mature, the larger the file of NFT works, the higher the storage cost on the chain. Therefore, at present, most NFT artworks are still stored in the form of off chain. In this case, they can only rely on the centralized server. Once the server is attacked, the security of the works will be greatly threatened.\n\nAnd even if we can “work on the chain”", "timestamp": 1653246048, "digest": "qaIzTjGb6c59V2XgwcvWPoAQz79rlLlV4n_WMqXvfOA", "contributor": "0x92Cce496362F3039d7746BCBEE0aDfA08ca98bDb"}

In the first half of 2018, China made many new breakthroughs and discoveries in the field of science. These new achievements continue to refresh the public’s perception of science and technology, and are also changing our lives.\n\nThe world’s first individual cell cloned monkey was born in China, which has a new prospect for the treatment of major brain diseases\n\nThe picture shows the somatic cloned monkeys “Zhongzhong” and “Huahua” provided by the Chinese Academy of Sciences\n\nAt a press conference held on January 24 this year, the Chinese Academy of Sciences announced that China has achieved somatic cloning of non-human primates for the first time in the world. Cell, an international academic journal of biology, published this achievement as a cover article and was published online on January 25, 2018. This achievement marks that China has taken the lead in opening a new era of using somatic cloned monkeys as experimental animal models, and has realized the transformation of China from international “parallel” to “leading” in the field of non-human primate research.\n\nIn addition to being of great significance in basic research, this achievement also contributes to solving the major challenges in the field of population health in China. It is reported that the use of somatic cell cloning technology to make brain disease model monkeys has brought unprecedented bright prospects for the mechanism research, intervention, diagnosis and treatment of major brain diseases faced by humans.\n\nChinese scientists took the lead in discovering the activation mechanism of human embryos, laying a foundation for eugenics\n\nIn March this year, the Beijing Genomics Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in cooperation with a number of domestic scientific research institutions, revealed the mystery of orderly gene expression, development and evolution of human embryos for the first time in the world. The research results were published in the international academic journal Cell.\n\nResearch shows that almost all kinds of cells in human body have a large number of gene expression. However, about two days after human fertilization is very special, during which there is almost no gene expression in the embryo. Scientists have found the key molecule that initiates the expression of the human genome (Oct4), and found that in the history of evolution, the first gene (old gene) will be expressed first, while the last gene will often be expressed later. The study also revealed an important new mechanism of human evolution. Scientific research shows that DNA mutation will cause human evolution. There is a kind of DNA fragment called transposon in the DNA sequence. They often jump from one region to another, which will produce DNA mutation. The research results have opened the door to understanding the gene expression regulation of human embryonic development, and will provide a theoretical basis for human eugenics.\n\nThe birth of the world’s first neurological disease model pig promotes the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other diseases\n\nThe picture shows the knock in pig of Huntington’s chorea gene. Source: Popular Science China\n\nAccording to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, after four years of efforts, the international research team led by Guangdong scientists successfully bred the world’s first case of Huntington’s chorea gene knockin pig by using gene editing technology (CRISPR / cas9) and somatic cell nuclear transfer technology for the first time. It can accurately simulate human neurodegenerative diseases, provide stable and reliable animal models for the treatment of Huntington’s chorea, Alzheimer’s disease and other diseases, and promote drug screening and treatment plan formulation. The results were published online in the journal Cell in the early morning of March 30, Beijing time.\n\nAs the world’s first case of Huntington’s disease gene knock into the pig model, the researchers introduced that it will promote the development of the pharmaceutical R & D industrial chain of large animal disease model in China, and promote the R & D process of new drugs for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, as well as immune deficiency, tumor and metabolic diseases. At the same time, the animal model can be used for preclinical evaluation of stem cell therapy and other means, and ultimately benefit mankind.\n\nScientists have discovered more than 100 gene loci that affect human hair color, making it possible for more accurate forensic DNA phenotypic characterization\n\nThe picture is provided by the Chinese Academy of Sciences for hair color classification for genome-wide association analysis\n\nScientists from the Beijing Genomics Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and scientific research institutions in several other countries have newly discovered more than 100 genes that affect human hair color, breaking the previous understanding that human hair color is mainly determined by several known genes, which helps to accurately predict the hair color of unknown criminals through DNA. The research results were published in the international journal Nature Genetics.\n\nPrevious researchers believe that human hair color is mainly determined by several known genes. This study shows that in addition to the known genes, hair color is affected by more than 100 newly discovered genetic loci. Human hair color prediction based on the newly discovered loci has higher accuracy, is conducive to guiding the follow-up study of human complex phenotypic genetics, and provides the possibility for more accurate forensic DNA phenotypic characterization.\n\nChinese scientists first revealed that the atomic resolution image and magic number effect of hydrated ions can shorten the battery charging time and increase the battery power\n\nAfter obtaining the world’s first sub molecular level resolved image of water molecules in 2014, Jiang Ying’s scientific research team, a professor at the quantum material science center of the school of physics of Peking University, obtained the atomic level resolved image of hydrated sodium ions for the first time in the world, and found a magic number effect of hydrated ion transport. The results were published in the international academic journal Nature on May 14.\n\nThe results show that the transport of ions in the confined environment or nanofluids can be controlled by changing the symmetry and periodicity of the surface lattice, so as to selectively enhance or weaken the transport capacity of certain ions, which has important potential significance for many related application fields, such as ion batteries, anti-corrosion, electrochemical reaction, seawater desalination, biological ion channels and so on. “ In addition, the experimental technology of the research exhibition has also pushed the research accuracy of hydration interaction to the atomic level for the first time. It is expected to be applied to more and wider hydrate systems and open up a new research field in the future.\n\nChina has successfully developed the first fully automatic stem cell induction and culture equipment in the world, laying the equipment foundation for regenerative medicine and precision medicine\n\nThe picture is provided by Chinese Academy of Sciences on the operation console of automatic stem cell induction and culture equipment\n\nThe development of the national major scientific research equipment development project “fully automatic stem cell induction and culture equipment” undertaken by Guangzhou Institute of biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, marks the birth of the world’s first intelligent stem cell induction and culture equipment with no one to stick to and deep neural network.\n\nThis device has completely independent intellectual property rights and is established from cell culture", "timestamp": 1653246605, "digest": "RwE_AEMYyyl67t4a_OttaqVVpKiEFB3hiILvGI9Rag0", "contributor": "0x7104f44B7296c82E0b055C354B90B01e04403f04"}

Например A\\*\\* (скриншот выше) может продать вам USDT на 100 рублей, не меньше.\n* Способ оплаты - у торговца должен быть указан такой же способ оплаты, как и добавленный вами в настройки, иначе обмен не получится.\n\nПодобрав нужного торговца нажимайте “Купить USDT” и вводите интересующую вас сумму\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8lGfjY1DkxHleKloBthN1.png?height=496&width=789)\n\nНажимайте кнопку “Купить USDT”, после этого вы попадете в торговый чат, где увидите номер карты торговца, на который нужно отправить рубли.\n\nКогда торговец подтвердит, что получил перевод криптовалюта зачислится на ваш счет.\n\n### Продаем крипту\n\nНа панели сверху выбирайте “Продать”, правее выбирайте крипту, которую хотите продать, например крипто доллар BTC и еще правее местную валюту которую хотите получить, например рубль.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/v1dpLQn2r2F9q90HgGtBi.png?height=582&width=1612)\n\nДалее как и с покупкой выбирайте подходящего торговца, обратите внимание на его лимиты и способ оплаты.\n\nПосле нажатия на кнопку “Продать” введите интересующую вас сумму и еще раз нажимайте “Продать”\n\nПосле этого вы попадете в чат с торговцем, дождитесь, когда на вашу карту придут рубли от торговца и только после этого отправляйте ему криптовалюту нажимая на кнопку “Отправить криптовалюту”.\n\n## Обмен крипты на крипту\n\nДопустим вам прислали оплату в BTC и вы хотите зафиксировать свои средства в более стабильной валюте, например USDT (крипто доллар, привязан к курсу доллара США). Тут все довольно просто:\n\nНа верхней панели выбирайте “Торги” и “Конвертировать”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YHt3gGiTXQUtJFEDtPdE-.png?height=875&width=1882)\n\nОткроется окно, в котором нужно выбрать какую крипту вы отдаете (например BTC) и какую хотите получить (например USDT). Вводите интересующую вас сумму и нажимайте кнопку “Конвертировать”. Данный обмен происходит автоматически, без участия человека с другой стороны.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gnzcz1KSwSiDRkdnlXsMc.png?height=618&width=752)\n\nГотово, вы обменяли биткоин на крипто доллар и теперь можете обменять его на рубли по достаточно стабильному курсу, либо использовать в любых других целях.\n\n## Перевести крипту на биржу\n\nЕсли вы не покупали крипту самостоятельно, а хотите получить перевод от другого человека не ваш счет на бирже, сделать это можно так:\n\nНа верхней панели находите кнопку “Активы” и там нажимайте “Пополнить”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7DBEkXyvgM5_NPINHrrIK.png?height=647&width=1874)\n\nДалее выбирайте интересующую вас валюту и (ОЧЕНЬ ВАЖНО!) сеть, из которой вы будете ее получать. Например биткоин (BTC) можно получить в основной сети BTC-Bitcoin или в сети BTC-Lightning. Уточняйте у отправителя средств как именно он будет это делать и только после этого сообщайте ему адрес для перевода.\n\nВыглядит окно пополнения так:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AQb2ktkyPOKVGNYH0ng4M.png?height=753&width=613)\n\nУвидеть список ваших активов на бирже можно в разделе “Мои активы”, он находится в меню “Активы” на верхней панели. Пополнение можно осуществлять так же из этого раздела.\n\n```\nЕсли материал оказался для вас полезным,\nможете отправить мне пару монет на кофе:\n0x354d4D759c49094f60D537bfD7177c05b70c20cC\n```", "timestamp": 1653247417, "digest": "VCx4yc_PzewAga7ECLmYKQiJq0eNZPsx22VGMPwSy2U", "contributor": "0x354d4D759c49094f60D537bfD7177c05b70c20cC"}

{"id": "Bg7XBcvo3Ac_cUo4yuYWu9jzNCmZWejoVDtAapg9nbA", "title": "How we found our Teddy :)", "body": "Last summer Sam FaceTime'd me & was talking to me about NFT’s. I knew what NFT’s were before we had that conversation but just never paid attention to it. He said : bro this space is perfect for you, don’t ask me why just go on twitter & join any NFT twitter space and you’ll find your journey, I am so excited to see where this story goes from here…\n\nI still remember saying : bro it’s 4 in the morning rn on a Saturday night and you’re telling me to go on twitter space rn and follow some monkey’s??? lol\n\nIn my mind I was like this dude’s lit & out of his right frame of mind. Finishing our sentences he said Teddy trust me, I know you and I am telling you this is a one way ticket to the life you have always dreamed but never lived and opportunities like this are very hard to find. I just laughed at it and I was like I’ll think about it and let you know…\n\nThen after a week I was playing soccer with Shadow in my backyard thinking about what Sam said the other day and tbh I enjoyed hearing him & everything he had to say with enthusiasm over the potential of NFT’s. Btw Sam is a well known artist in the space, and now after spending all this time in this space I get it why he was hyper that day. Anyways, then I went on my twitter and switched my profile form private to public. I joined my first twitter space, It was with @NFTPrince & NFTsquirrels. Both are living legends and I respect them a lot. They shared tons of selfless advice to me on first day without even knowing who I was, what my real name is, or how I looked like. The knowledge was so valuable that basically I’ve never been rugged / scammed in this space till date. \n\nAfter spending some time in different spaces and observing how everything is working in this ecosystem, I focused on the fundamentals, the way people interact and react with certain things, what values they carried, and how do they find their feeling of importance. It was’nt very difficult for me to figure these things out because of my knowledge & experience with Social Media for over 5 years. I grew 36 million+ followers on Instagram via different entertainment pages and a network of over 250 million+ followers via networking in less than 6 months with just 2,000$ to start with from my college dorm.\n\nDuring that time Bored Ape’s were just flying and they still are but the vibes were immaculate last year you can’t deny that. I literally did a PHD on them and I was just astounded by their story but I was able to relate a lot of it to my life, it was so inspiring and fascinating. I was thinking so much about it, that even in my dreams I was seeing NFT’s all around me and my life changed the night of September 30 when i had that one lucid dream, I decided to do a project to share my story so that others can relate to it and be a part of it. \n\n( Note : This was’nt the main reason for me to do a NFT project. My main goal was and is still the same today that I want to leave this NFT space better than how I found it. )\n\nBack to the story, why Teddy? Well obviously. My friend’s call me Teddy and Teddies have been a part of everyone’s childhood and I believe people will hold on to that tradition forever. They provide us the comfort & companionship, a friend to talk to, and it’s not just kids who benefit from the positive effects of a comforting Teddy squeeze. Teddies are just universal and timeless.\n\nI put all of my traits and character and imagination’s in the art, from my expressions to the way I dress. Some of the assets are added for the aesthetics of the collection. I am not an artist but since I was the character I worked with few freelance artist’s to bring my idea on paper. They asked me for a sketch to give an idea of what I wanted and this is what I sent them lmao 😂😂😂😂😂😂\n\n![ That Yu-Gi-Oh and LV belt part has my heart lmaoooo😭😭😭. Tbh this image is still a lot better than my first one. Btw I am not rich lol, I don't have a AP watch or fancy items.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p7SJwXfpBXm-_G9fiTlu0.jpg?height=1280&width=960)\n\n![This looks decent lol. Lot better than what I came up with.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vxl5Z9dogU0G7wxHt-euI.png?height=1280&width=720)\n\n![That's me on the Left! Dw I am doxed to all our past holder's and lot of people in NFT space know me irl. My identity is just not public in the space atm. I'll reveal it when time is right.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CL1JyGEQS_ynX1v0M1WGn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nBack to the story, so once I got this I reached out to few professional artist’s in my network and I worked with multiple of them to find the perfect Teddy. We wanted to stick with 2D because 3D art is great but the market seemed to be doing well with 2D more than 3D collections. Ofcs art style isn’t the main reason for it but it does play a role. But then I am like let’s take the challenge and create something insane. During the time when I started the project, their were’nt any 3D project’s coming out just yet nor there were any noticeable Teddy Bear collections popping as long as I know. So then we decided to turn this into 3D. During this process one 3D artist reached out to me in my DM’s of one our meme page asking to collab, I am like okay cool lets give it a shot and see what you got. \n\n![This is what he came up with as base model. 💀💀💀](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FcshCcWqBzufElk9puKnW.png?height=772&width=778)\n\nYeah he just lost me on that base model. If ur surprised, I did’nt see this coming either, when I saw it for the first time I was out of words just like you are rn. I seriously had no comments on this image. So yeah I had to say no to that dude and look for another artist. The fact that people fake their LinkedIn and show you proof of work of other artist is just hilarious. So I asked one of my friend on telegram if he knew any artist to connect me and he did. \n\n![Idk tbh, it was just not it.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z3yiJzSTaGmqQdaHZroTJ.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nIt just did’nt feel right going with the full body at this point, gave pfp style a shot and see how it does. Initially the idea was, we will do pfp collection and in a seperate contract and we will give the holders full body version of their Teddy so they have both and can use it the way they like whether to animate or so with the source file…\n\n![I finally said yes to this one and made a deal with the artist and gave her an upfront amount for her time that we both agreed on. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ef-d0SnN5nrZH4EpHIfbn.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThe decided to upfront because she told me she had financial instability and urgently need of money for rent and expenses so she would’nt be able to work full time on this project and it would take lot longer to complete the collection than what I was expecting. Plus I genuinely wanted to help her regardless of if she would work for the project or not due to her situation. \n\n![My mind, Her ability.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q7q8YdENYDP5zDlajLh05.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nWe decided to fully render and rigg the collection in the end after all the traits and assets are illustrated and confirmed so that their isn't any confusions and nothing is left out. But unfortunately when she submitted, the quality of collection turned out terrible atleast from my pov. I communicated it with our community and told them that ‘guys we do not have the collection fully rigged and its in between 2D and 3D so we would have to pause the project for now until we find another artist and see how things go from there’. \n\nBut then I was also out of funds because I put everything I had in the project initially. So I communicated this with the community in our discord and 34 people ended up minting 100 regardless of the situation. 10 were minted for team and 1 was minted by me personally to participate in the process just like any other member of community. They knew that mint had zero value and won’t have a secondary market value but yet they still supported. So that moment onwards my belief in the project became even stronger and quitting was never an option no matter what situation I go through. The collection won’t ever be revealed because I don’t believe in trying to sell some bullshit to people just to pocket some eth. In trying to sell NFT’s I am not going to sell my character, tf I look like? ZagaBond? There is a big fat difference between failing and abandoning your project. We don’t give up around here…This project is my dream and it like a child to me. I want to be the best out there in anything I do in life. Whether if it is playing soccer or anything that I hold dear too I give my absolute best to win. When I play soccer I don’t play to just participate I play to make difference, I play to dominate the field. \n\n[https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub](https://opensea.io/collection/toxicteddyclub)\n\nSo yeah that was my first failure in NFT space, I learned a lot from that failure. The most important thing was that when starting a business do everything you can to gather great people that have the same drive & BELIEVE IN YOUR VISION as you do. Because in the end all a business is a group of people dedicated to provide service or product to people. Take care of your team like your family & they’ll take care of your business & customers. \n\nThen after I did an outreach again and managed to find a team of 4 professional 3D artist’s. Their past ventures have involved working with brands like Puma, Bangs and Lulu Lemon. Their Identities are anon as they wish to keep it that way but I have confirmed the veracity of their credentials. When I presented this entire idea and vision of the collection to them, after hearing me they instantly said yes and told be that we believe in you and we’re gonna make the best collection of 2022. We started working on it the same day and even with this team, I worked 1 on 1 with the team over screen shares for every single trait’s and asset’s and outcomes are just fantastic. Look It does’nt matter what people think of it but we do believe it is one of the greatest NFT collections that will ever be deployed on Blockchain. We’ve put our blood, sweat and tears in this collection as a team day in and day out. The collection is timeless & it will age well I can make that one promise for sure. \n\n![This collection is dedicated to someone who does'nt need to own it. It's a dream come true. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wKl-h3xgt9G73xjvxW_7_.png?height=1280&width=1280)\n\nThere is no bigger feeling than making your dream come true and the story will never have an end to be honest. I am just the captain of the boat as of now but at some point I want to hand the dream over to the community in a position that even if I am not present the story live forever as long as their is imagination left in this world. \n\nBig hug & Thank you for your time and consideration for reading this. I genuinely appreciate your presence here with all my heart.

Zhurong found signs of recent water activity on Mars", "body": "◎ science and Technology Daily reporter Lu Chengkuan\n\nChinese scientists have found signs of water activity on Mars.\n\nOn May 11, science progress published an important research result on Martian water activities. Based on the short wave infrared spectrum and navigation Terrain Camera data obtained by the Mars rover zhurong, Chinese researchers found a plate-shaped bright colored rock similar to sedimentary rock on the surface of Mars. Further analysis found that these plate-shaped bright colored rocks are rich in minerals such as water bearing sulfate.\n\nThis marks the first time that zhurong international has used the short wave infrared spectrometer on the rover to detect water bearing minerals in situ on Mars.\n\n“The discovery of signs of water activity in the relatively young geological age landing area of zhurong indicates that the Martian hydrosphere during the Amazon period may be more active than previously thought. This discovery is of great significance to understand the evolution history of Martian climate and environment.” Liu Yang, the first author and corresponding author of the paper and researcher of the National Space Science Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said.\n\nThe zhurong Mars rover carried by China’s first Mars exploration mission tianwen-1 successfully landed in the southern region of Utopia plain on May 15, 2021. Up to now, the Mars rover zhurong has been traveling in the utopian plain in the northern lowlands of Mars for one year, with a total of nearly 2000 meters, and has obtained a large number of valuable scientific exploration data.\n\nThe existing dating work of the impact crater shows that the landing area of the Mars rover zhurong is located in the Amazon stratum after the later reconstruction event. During the Amazon period, the climate of Mars has changed from warm and humid to cold and dry. The analysis of orbital remote sensing data shows that a variety of geomorphic features distributed around the landing site indicate that there may have been a large amount of volatile matter in the utopian plain.\n\nHowever, “limited by the spatial resolution and coverage, the orbital remote sensing data did not find water bearing minerals near the landing area, which brings many questions about the formation mechanism of such landforms and the nature of water activities in the area.” Liu Yang said.\n\nThe research team believes that the plate-shaped bright colored rock found by zhurong is a hard shell developed locally in the landing area. Compared with the broken rocks observed in situ by the American pirate 1 Mars Lander, the hard shell in the zhurong landing area seems to be more erosion resistant, and the hard shell layer is relatively thick.\n\n“Forming such a thick hard shell requires a lot of liquid water, which cannot be formed only by water vapor in the atmosphere.” Liu Yang explained.\n\nAt the same time, the study found that there was no obvious surface runoff or river trace in the landing area, and no fluffy surface and salt frost residues formed by water evaporation were found around the inspection route, which ruled out the possibility of large-scale water activities on the surface of the landing area.\n\nIn this regard, the research team proposed a new formation mechanism. This mechanism suggests that the soil weathering layer before the Martian sedimentary period experienced cementation and diagenesis during the rise or infiltration of salt rich groundwater, forming the observed tabular rocks. Salt cements precipitate in capillary pores or groundwater near the water table, and active evaporation and accumulation occur. The intermittent fluctuation of groundwater level may further thicken the hard shell and form layered structure. Subsequently, the topsoil covered on the hard shell is eroded away, exposing the erosion resistant hard shell layer.\n\nLiu Yang said that the discovery of the zhurong Rover showed that the water activity of Mars during the Amazon period may be more active than previously thought. The zhurong landing area and the extensive area of the northern plains of Mars may contain a large amount of available water in the form of hydrous minerals.\n\nReviewed by: Yue Liang", "timestamp": 1653248785, "digest": "_LTu9Jrk_e-jSFs_Naz3_g7DFG5jeNlwoduu392sNwI", "contributor": "0x3e964Ff29b57EB3836b015D1d335906BF6CfBB1f"}

In order to protect their safety, the police of the Beijing Mobile Investigation Corps hid in the crowd and did not miss a trace of trouble. On October 1, national day, the first thief was arrested in Daxing Yizhuang. Yesterday’s Mid Autumn Festival, the police arrested five pickpockets in Orson. Since the national day, all the police of the Beijing Mobile Investigation Corps have stuck to their posts and arrested 32 pickpocketing suspects.\n\nThe first thief Daxing bus station was arrested\n\nSince the national day, when tourists and citizens gather in public places and scenic spots, there are some invisible guards at the entrances and exits of the surrounding bus and subway stations, parks and scenic spots. They look no different from other tourists, but their sharp eyes keep scanning the wind and grass in the crowd, secretly guarding the safety of tourists. They are the police of the mobile Investigation Corps of the Municipal Public Security Bureau.\n\nOn the morning of October 1, the mobile Investigation Corps and the police of Yizhuang police station found two men acting suspiciously while carrying out pickpocketing, patrol and control along the bus in Yizhuang. The police followed the control all the way to nandahongmen bus station. When two men stole a passenger’s mobile phone, they were arrested by the police on the spot. Subsequently, the police seized 6 stolen mobile phones and 1 Wallet (including 2 ID cards and several bank cards) from the car driven by the two suspects.\n\n14 pickpockets were arrested on the same day\n\nAfter examination, the suspects Li and Wang explained the illegal facts of stealing seven mobile phones and one wallet. At present, the two suspects have been criminally detained by Daxing Branch. The case is still under further investigation.\n\nThe reporter of Beijing Youth Daily learned from the mobile Investigation Corps that Li and Wang were the first thieves arrested by Beijing anti pickpocketing police during the national day week.\n\nOn October 1, the whole police of the mobile Investigation Corps of the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched to successively crack 6 pickpocketing cases and 14 pickpocketing suspects in Beijing subway station, Tiananmen Jinshui bridge, Beijing West Railway Station subway, Beihai north railway station, Yuanda Road station and other places.\n\nFive pickpockets in Orson were caught yesterday\n\nYesterday’s Mid Autumn Festival, Beijing was clear and crisp in autumn, which was especially suitable for travel. The Olympic Forest Park has also welcomed tourists from all over the country.\n\nIt is reported that in view of the characteristics of large passenger flow and pickpockets during the Olympic Forest Park Festival, the mobile Investigation Corps and Chaoyang Branch deploy special police forces to jointly carry out pickpocketing operations to escort the people.\n\nAt 2:40 PM, “don’t move, police!” With a loud cry, several plainclothes arrested a man at the entrance of the Olympic Forest Park Station of Metro Line 8. It turned out that the man took advantage of the tourists’ inattention to pick up the camera he was carrying, but he didn’t know that his every move had long been mastered by the anti pickpocketing investigators, who arrested him when he succeeded in pickpocketing.\n\nIt is understood that on October 4, the Mid Autumn Festival, five pickpocketing suspects were arrested around the Olympic Forest Park and are currently under review by Chaoyang Branch.\n\nSince the National Day holiday, all the police of the mobile Investigation Corps of the Municipal Public Security Bureau have stuck to their posts and arrested 32 pickpocketing suspects, which has advantageously ensured the safety of the people.\n\nBeijing police suggest that there are many people traveling during holidays.

{"id": "s5hu9UDyPDRExvoP4Q9tC56wQnWEqQZMubATy4-v4T0", "title": "The recent fluctuation of RMB exchange rate is market correction rather than policy guidance", "body": "The recent fluctuation of RMB exchange rate is market correction rather than policy guidance\n\nLast week (April 18-22), the closing price (i.e. the closing price of the interbank market at 4:30 p.m.) and the central parity of the domestic RMB exchange rate (hereinafter, if not specifically referred to, refer to the RMB exchange rate against the US dollar) fell below 6.40 to 1 on the 20th and 21st, and closed at 6.4875 and 6.4596 on Friday, respectively. The cumulative decline in that week was 1.7% and 1.0% respectively. Both domestic and foreign exchange rates fell below 6.50 on Friday night. Last November, the central bank proposed for the first time that “the degree of deviation is directly proportional to the correction force”. The correction of market forces finally came again.\n\nI guessed this round of RMB exchange rate adjustment again\n\nLast year, when the market was bullish that the RMB exchange rate would rise above 6.0, the author said frankly that this would be a small probability event and “guessed” that the RMB might not go as strong as expected. As a result, even though the multilateral exchange rate of RMB increased significantly throughout the year, the bilateral exchange rate of RMB against the US dollar increased by only slightly more than 2%, and the highest price in the year did not rise below 6.34.\n\nThis year, the author warned of the possible risks of Fed tightening. At the end of February, the author was invited to write an article and put forward seven spillover channels, four impact scenarios and six countermeasures. The article was officially published at the end of March. A few days ago, when I attended the Tsinghua Wudaokou global financial forum, I further pointed out that the tightening of the Fed’s policy is an important factor affecting the trend of the RMB exchange rate this year, and made judgments in four scenarios or four stages.\n\nIn the first scenario or stage, the Federal Reserve will tighten moderately and orderly, the inflow of foreign capital in China will slow down, and the appreciation of RMB will slow down; In the second scenario or stage, the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates more aggressively or even start to shrink the table at the same time, which will cause turbulence in the US economy and financial market, lead to phased capital outflow from China, and the RMB exchange rate will fluctuate in both directions; In the third scenario or stage, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening is stronger than expected, which may puncture the asset foam and trigger an economic recession. China will not be able to survive alone, and the RMB exchange rate will be under pressure again; In the fourth scenario or stage, after the crisis, the Federal Reserve will return to monetary easing. If China can continue to maintain the leading position of economic recovery in the world, it may return to capital return and the RMB exchange rate will be stronger.\n\nAt that time, the author made it clear that China has now smoothly passed the first stage - the Federal Reserve’s reduction in bond purchase, but we should still pay high attention and vigilance to the future, because the development and changes of the situation may be nonlinear. Now it seems that the author is unfortunately right. This wave of RMB exchange rate correction since mid March, especially the cumulative drop of one or two cents in the past three trading days, is an important background for the enhanced tightening expectation of the Federal Reserve. At the same time, this also confirms the author’s research experience that using public information can make trend judgment.\n\nThe recent sharp decline is a concentrated catharsis of market sentiment\n\nSince the beginning of June 2020, the domestic epidemic has been well prevented and controlled, the economy has recovered rapidly, the external dollar index is weak, and the interest rate gap between China and the United States is large. Together, it points to the appreciation of the RMB exchange rate, which has increased by nearly 10% by the end of the year. Last year, the supporting role of factors such as the slowdown of economic recovery, the turmoil of financial markets, the rebound of the US dollar index and the convergence of China US interest rate spread weakened, but the leading prevention and control of the epidemic and the continuation of foreign demand boom drove the RMB exchange rate to continue to appreciate slightly against the rebound of the US index.\n\nAfter the interest rate meeting in March this year, with the further rise of US inflation, the expectation of monetary tightening in the market is becoming stronger and stronger. The US index accelerated its rebound, breaking 100 in mid April; US bond yields soared, superimposed on the differentiation of China US monetary policy, and the interest rate spread between China and the United States converged rapidly or even upside down. Last week, the Fed’s “Eagle Song” was louder. Last Monday, St. Louis Fed chairman Brad publicly proposed a one-time interest rate increase of 75 basis points in May; Last Thursday, Powell said at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that a 50 basis point interest rate increase would be discussed in May, and a similar interest rate increase might be needed to curb inflation; Last Friday, Nomura Securities latest forecast that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by 75 basis points in June and July. Affected by this, the US index stood above 100 last week, the exchange rate of the yen against the US dollar hit a 20-year low, and the exchange rate of the RMB against the yen hit a six-and-a-half-year high.\n\nAt the beginning of March, the RMB exchange rate also hit a new high in recent four years, but there have been signs of adjustment since the middle of the year. At that time, the Risk Spillover of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine was superimposed, the supervision of Chinese stocks was strengthened, the domestic epidemic rebounded sharply, and the RMB exchange rate was quickly corrected, wiping out all the gains in last year, and then fluctuated repeatedly around the level at the end of last year. Recently, due to the spread of the epidemic in a few cities, the problem of smooth economic circulation has become more prominent, which has exacerbated the market’s concerns about domestic economic recovery and export prospects. On April 19, the IMF lowered China’s economic growth forecast for this year by 0.4 percentage points, and the RMB exchange rate fell below 6.40 from that day. On April 22, the middle price and closing price fell by 1.7% and 2.2% respectively compared with the end of last month, and fell by 1.3% and 1.8% respectively compared with the end of last year.\n\nSome people attribute the recent fluctuation of RMB exchange rate to the intentional guidance of the central parity quotation mechanism, which is contrary to the fact. Whether the adjustment in mid and late March or recently, it is driven by the offshore market. The offshore RMB exchange rate (CNH) continued to be weak relative to the onshore RMB exchange rate (CNY). The daily average price difference was 1.5% from March 11 to 31 and 2.7% from April 20 to 22. This reflects that after foreign capital reduced its holdings of domestic RMB financial assets, it purchased foreign exchange in the offshore market, driving the weakness of CNH. In addition, the record low exchange rate of the yen against the US dollar triggered speculation about intervening in the depreciation of the yen. In addition, China’s uncertain economic prospects triggered the closing of the yen carry trade of buying high interest rate RMB assets with low interest rate yen. The resulting foreign exchange purchase accelerated the downward trend of CNH and pushed down CNY. If the central bank is wrong, it is also “wrong”. After the counter cyclical factor is faded out and used, it abides by the transparency principle of the middle price quotation mechanism and does not regulate it.\n\nThe rise and fall of the RMB exchange rate should be viewed with an ordinary mind\n\nFrom the expectation of RMB exchange rate implied in one-year non deliverable forward (NDF), the daily average depreciation expectation was 1.16% from April 20 to 22, up from 0.42% from March 11 to April 19, but not significant, and the highest was only 1.29%. In the future, we should pay attention to whether it converges or diverges.

BiliBili’s share price, which lowered its first quarter net turnover forecast on the evening of May 2, fell by more than 8%.\n\nSince the Internet industry became more strictly regulated in 2021, the share price performance of relevant companies has been weak. But recently, the warm wind in the industry is blowing frequently. Some institutions said that the current domestic policies can effectively ensure the orderly and stable development of the Internet industry, and the prospect is worth looking forward to. China’s Internet has entered a mature and prosperous period, and the leading effect continues to appear.\n\nLiu qiangdong’s reduction of Jingdong health\n\nOn May 4, after the opening of JD health, the share price fell all the way, with a maximum drop of more than 14%. As of the close, the decline narrowed to 10.18%, with a total market value of about HK $1438 billion, an evaporation of nearly HK $16.2 billion from the previous day.\n\nAccording to the equity disclosure data of the Hong Kong stock exchange, Liu qiangdong, founder and chairman of JD group, recently reduced his shareholding in JD health twice, involving about 8.8404 million shares, totaling nearly HK $440 million, which is the first reduction of Liu qiangdong’s shareholding since JD health was listed at the end of 2020. Liu Qiang Dong’s stock was sold at an average price of HK $450 million per share on the day of June, which was about HK $300 million; On April 29, 3.84 million shares were sold at an average price of HK $50.67 per share, cashing out HK $195 million.\n\nAfter the reduction, Liu qiangdong’s shareholding in JD health decreased from 68.94% to 68.66%.\n\nThe annual report shows that JD health’s annual revenue in 2021 was 30.68 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 58.3%; The net loss was 1.07 billion yuan, a year-on-year loss of 17.235 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 93.8%. As of December 31, 2021, the annual number of active users of JD health has reached 123 million, a net increase of 33.56 million compared with the number of active users in 2020.\n\nShen NANPENG’s reduction in meituan\n\nCoincidentally, meituan was also recently reduced by well-known investor Shen NANPENG. Today, its share price once plunged by more than 6%. As of press time, the decline narrowed to 4%, with a total market value of HK $1.02 trillion, an evaporation of nearly HK $50 billion from the previous day.\n\nAccording to the equity information disclosed by the Hong Kong stock exchange, Shen NANPENG, independent non-executive director of meituan and founding managing partner of Sequoia Capital, reduced a total of 42.9572 million shares of meituan last Wednesday (April 27) and last Friday (April 29), cashing out about HK $6.227 billion. Shen NANPENG meituan’s shareholding has decreased from 3.98% to 3.19%.\n\nHong Kong stock Internet giants fell sharply one after another\n\nNot only JD health and meituan, but also Hong Kong stock Internet giants fell sharply today, and the Hang Seng technology index fell by more than 3%. BiliBili fell by more than 8%, Ali health fell by nearly 6%, and jd.com and Kwai fell by more than 4%.\n\nAmong them, bilibilibili issued an update announcement on the guidance of net turnover on the evening of May 2, which lowered the expectation of net turnover in the first quarter. The announcement shows that due to the unexpected spread of the epidemic in China, many cities and regions, including Shanghai, have successively implemented static management since mid March, which has had a certain impact on the overall economy and enterprise operation. Based on this, BiliBili expects the net turnover in the first quarter of 2022 to be between 5 billion yuan and 5.1 billion yuan, and the previously estimated net turnover was between 5.3 billion yuan and 5.5 billion yuan.\n\nBiliBili also said in the announcement that its community continued to grow. The average monthly active users in the first quarter of 2022 was 293.6 million, a year-on-year increase of 31.5%; The average daily active users were 79.4 million, a year-on-year increase of 32%. In the first quarter, the average daily use time of a single user was up to 95 minutes, reaching the highest record since the operation of station B.\n\nSince 2021, the Internet industry has become more strictly regulated, the share price performance of relevant companies has plummeted, the Hang Seng technology index has fallen all the way, and the investor sentiment is also relatively low. But recently, Internet stocks have been blowing. Haitong Securities said that the current domestic policies can effectively ensure the orderly and stable development of the Internet industry, and the prospect is worth looking forward to. China’s Internet has entered a mature and prosperous period, and the leading effect continues to appear.\n\nLooking forward to the future, Zheng Jian, assistant fund manager of ChuangJin Hexin, said that at present, mainstream Chinese Internet companies still generally have a valuation allowance of about 30% compared with their American counterparts, and their valuation is also outside the two standard deviations of the five-year average valuation, which belongs to a more attractive stage of valuation. The repeated interest rate hikes in Russia and Ukraine had a great impact on the US market in the first half of the year. From the perspective of fundamentals, we believe that the performance of the industry in the second half of this year will be better than that in the first half of this year, and the performance driven growth will prevail in the second half of this year. Therefore, we are optimistic about the allocation value of Hang Seng technology index for a long time.\n\nThe exclusive investment gift package under the rebound market!

(content source: Elle Chinese website)\n\nRecently, when Guan Xiaotong attended the event, he wore a blue sweater with a checkered skirt and collided with American cutting-edge supermodel Kaia Geber!\n\nLooking at their whole body photos, I suddenly found that in addition to hitting their shirts, they were eye-catching, and their big long legs hit each other!\n\nRecently, Guan Xiaotong attended the award ceremony of Weibo night. A neat mini dress with silver high heels also found a very similar match in Gaia’s activity dress. The most important thing is that when they appear, they are more concerned about what they wear. Visually, the two meter long legs have been amazing, and the reincarnation of leg essence is probably the same!\n\nBecause they have the same good figure against the sky and the same youthful vitality, they have a high similarity in dressing.\n\nSkirt chapter\n\nWith such a pair of good legs, they naturally prefer short skirts.\n\nThe shorter the skirt, the longer the leg. It is 100% applicable to two people.\n\nWhen we wore small dresses on formal occasions, we found that both of them had chosen small dresses with short front and long back. The long skirts were grand and the short skirts were energetic, showing their good figure.\n\nBut in the daily choice of medium and long skirts, we also found the differences between the two.\n\nGuan Xiaotong prefers A-line skirts above the knee, just like a clever and sweet girl next door.\n\nGaia Geber prefers the knee length skirt with straight tube, and the high waist element directly means the visual sense of “legs below the chest”.\n\nTrousers\n\nIn the choice of trousers, both of them are the routine of “long legs, willful and casual wear”, which only wants people to shout “God is unfair”.\n\nIf you think Guan Xiaotong’s long legs are just the same after reading the dress in front, please take a look at Guan Xiaotong who wears shorts to know what leg essence is. Casual jacket with denim shorts, general matching routine, unusual long legs.\n\nPerhaps there is no truth that “Cowboy SHORTS show long legs”, but Cowboy SHORTS are placed on long legs.

If you can meet at a street corner many years later, I hope you can recognize me at a glance. I used to be my best friend.\n\nPolite greetings\n\n01\n\nToday, when I was brushing the circle of friends, I suddenly saw the news of a junior high school classmate getting married. In the photo, he became a lot more handsome, not like the big fool in junior high school at all. And he is one of the best partners I played in junior high school.\n\nWe have a dormitory. We have to go back together after class, eat and play ball together, and even go to the bathroom. We said we would be good brothers for a lifetime, but in high school and college, we all went to different places and schools, and gradually had less contact. Until today, my good brother got married, but I didn’t know.\n\nI sent him a “happy wedding” message. I didn’t receive a “thank you” until just now. I wanted to say something more, but I didn’t know where to start and what to say. It seems that there are only some polite greetings left.\n\nPass by\n\n02\n\nAlong the way, we met many people, some of whom passed by when they became partners, while others passed by when they became partners.\n\nThe childhood sweetheart who quarreled over who should be the father and who should be the mother; The little sister who dances rubber bands with you and puts on makeup for the doll; The troublemaker who plays marbles with you and secretly pulls the girl’s hair. Do you remember these people in those years? Do you still have contact?\n\nTime goes on and people go in all directions. Maybe some people just walk away. We always grow up in thinking, grow up in habit and forget in habit. Just like when I first went to college, I always miss my high school classmates, but I also met new classmates and new friends while I miss them, and those old classmates we miss also have new companionship.\n\nSome people accompany her to class instead of us, some people eat with her instead of us, and some people talk gossip with her instead of us, watch Korean dramas, laugh and cry together. Her circle of friends is no longer a lonely selfie and sad words. Gradually, there are group photos of eating, singing and watching movies together, just like the group photos of eating, singing and watching movies together. But now, we don’t know the people and places in the photos, and the comments are gradually less, until there is only an occasional love.\n\nAt the same time, we are also busy shuttling around in the new environment, taking the postgraduate entrance examination, or playing games with new friends. Every night is no longer holding a mobile phone to chat with old classmates, and no longer need to ask you how you are doing and how you are doing. After all, your circle of friends has explained everything.\n\nI don’t know when we began to have less contact. Our chat also moved from the chat box to the circle of friends, then looked at it, and then brushed it calmly until we finally had nothing to say from the initial nothing to the present nothing to say.\n\nIt dispersed as we walked\n\n03\n\nAdults often say that old classmates should keep in touch. You still have contact with junior high school classmates. What’s the one who used to come to our house to play now. Sorry, I really can’t answer some questions, because we haven’t been in touch for a long time. I don’t know whether I’m too ruthless or time is too meaningless. In short, we are drifting away in the torrent of time.\n\nFriendship may be a phased product, and some people are destined to accompany us only for a period of time. Just like when I studied in Spain, I also met many friends who played very well, but then I returned home and they stayed there. In this way, we seem to be people in two completely different worlds. I said we should prepare for the final exam tomorrow, and he said he was preparing for the Christmas holiday.\n\nWhen the stage of our common life is over, we move towards a new beginning, have a new environment, new friends, and perhaps the feelings we once had are fading quietly. We chat less and less, and our chat words are shorter and shorter. You have your new world and I have my new life.\n\nOccasionally in the circle of friends to see the dynamics of old friends, think of our crazy days together, want to talk a few words, but don’t know where to start. After all, for a long time, sometimes I really don’t know what to say, and what else belongs to our common topic. After all, the memory will gradually fade until the last sentence is “really, I don’t remember”.\n\nYoung and frivolous\n\n04\n\nIndeed, time has changed our appearance, but it has also lengthened our distance. Fortunately, my young frivolous has your participation, and your love is accompanied by me.\n\nDear old friends, maybe we don’t have much contact now, but please believe I’ve never forgotten you. The happy songs and laughter you have brought me will still emerge one after another when I revisit my hometown. The future that I can’t participate with you will still bless silently in the distance.\n\nIf you can meet at a street corner many years later, I hope you can recognize me at a glance.

According to the report of securities times · e company, on May 10, some production lines of BYD Changsha factory have been shut down for rectification. In the past two months, thousands of residents in more than a dozen communities around BYD’s factory in Yuhua District, Changsha jointly reported that they often smell strong paint smell. According to Phoenix technology, the paint smell is the most serious from the evening to the early morning, and hundreds of children have experienced unexplained epistaxis. After the topic of “suspected nosebleed of many children caused by BYD factory pollution” was put on the hot search, on the same day of May 7, BYD Changsha Yuhua District Industrial Park issued a statement, which did not deny the existence of peculiar smell around the factory and said that “the company has taken relevant measures and actively improved it”. However, for the situation of “nosebleed caused by excessive emission”, the statement said that “it is a malicious fabricated Association and has been reported to the police.” On May 8, the Changsha Government Affairs official account “couch cloth” issued a document saying that the Changsha Municipal Party committee and government had set up an investigation team and stationed in BYD Yuhua District factory to investigate. Relevant media reports pointed out that the source of the odor, or the coating workshop of BYD Yuhua District factory. In fact, BYD has a “criminal record” in this regard. In 2019, Changsha BYD was regarded as a key complained enterprise and included in the key supervision object due to the impact of pollutants discharged from the production waste gas of the spraying workshop on the lives of nearby residents. An employee of a car company in Beijing told boxed lunch finance that painting, electroplating and other links will indeed affect the environment. “Because of environmental protection requirements, we have no painting factories in Beijing, and the corresponding businesses are given to factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai.” According to Chinese philanthropists, citing the views of people in the automobile industry, the coating process of automobile production will produce a large number of pollutants. If not handled properly, it will have an impact on the surrounding atmosphere and water. Among them, the paint waste gas mainly comes from the volatile waste gas produced by the organic solvent contained in the paint during spraying and drying, which is called volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and the main components are benzene, toluene, xylene, etc. The employees of the above car enterprises also said that there was no corresponding fact and it was impossible to confirm that the odor came from BYD production line. China Securities Journal reported on May 8 that some peculiar smell near the factory may be diesel exhaust and engine oil, and the source of the peculiar smell cannot be confirmed. In an interview with China Securities Journal, the staff of the Management Committee of Changsha Yuhua Economic Development Zone said, “we will find a third-party testing institution recognized by the surrounding residents to participate… But the truth needs to be carefully investigated.” 01\n\nWhen buying a car, few consumers will be aware of the pollution behind the beautiful appearance of the car. Painting on the car surface has two functions: one is decoration, and the other is to protect the car body from corrosion; But on the other hand, coating is also a serious part of exhaust gas in automobile production process. “Paint smell” is the core of the public opinion storm around BYD. Before that, there were many disputes about its coating workshop. In 2019, Changsha BYD was complained about waste gas pollution in the spraying workshop and was included in the key supervision object of local relevant departments. According to a document on the official website of Hunan Provincial Department of ecological environment, the serious paint smell in the coating workshop of BYD Yuhua District factory is basically true, and the document date is May 8, 2021. According to an EIA report in December 2021, the waste gas from the electrophoresis process in the coating workshop was directly and unorganized discharged by BYD Changsha factory in the early stage without collection. In addition, the types and values of 24 organic substances in the report were not disclosed. In three years, the problem of coating workshop has not been solved. BYD’s environmental protection issues have always been highly concerned. Since November 2011, BYD and its affiliated companies have been punished by relevant departments for environmental protection for many times. The reasons for punishment include excessive toluene discharge, excessive exhaust gas discharge, direct discharge of wastewater and other issues. Not only BYD, but also its competitor Tesla has recently attracted criticism for paint related problems. According to foreign media electek reported on May 4, the German environmental protection organization Green Alliance asked to revoke the business license of Tesla’s super factory in Berlin, Germany after learning of a serious paint leakage accident. Previously, the organization had asked the local court to stop the Tesla Berlin plant project for reasons such as deforestation and water resources control, which is also a major reason why Tesla didn’t get the business license of the local plant until this year. Electek quoted German media rbb24 as saying that the 15000 liters of paint leaked by Tesla had been properly handled, and only 2 to 3 liters fell on the road and solidified during loading. The leakage is considered to have slight harm to the water body. Although it did not enter the sewage or sewer system in the end, the green alliance still requires relevant institutions to revoke Tesla’s factory license until Tesla completes the laying of some unpaved areas around the paint workshop to prevent dangerous materials from entering the aquifer. A source disclosed to electek that the coating workshop is the main bottleneck of the production capacity of Tesla Berlin super factory. In the past two years, Tesla, weixiaoli and other auto companies have expanded their factories in China. Why is only BYD involved in the vortex of pollution? At present, the investigation of relevant facts has not been completed, but many industry people in contact with boxed lunch finance believe that too close to residential areas and the rapid expansion of production capacity are two possible factors. According to the national standard for health protection distance of automobile manufacturers, considering the influence of wind direction, terrain and other factors, the distance between the factory and the residential area should range from 300m to 500m. Some residents involved in the incident are only one road away from the factory, only 40 to 50 meters away, and the nearby Jiahe school is only 300 meters away from the factory. According to a research report of the environmental protection organization green Jiangnan and Public Environment Research Center (IPE), in 2016, a Toyota supplier was fined 100000 yuan by the local regulatory authorities for being complained by surrounding residents about excessive exhaust gas. The report shows that the supplier’s factory is only one road from the residential area. If the factory is too close to the residential area, it is easy to affect the living conditions of residents. Other new car building forces have also considered relevant factors in the site selection of self built factories. Take Xiaopeng as an example. Xiaopeng’s self built factory is located in Zhaoqing, Guangzhou. According to the environmental impact report of Zhaoqing Xiaopeng automobile intelligent network technology industrial park project released by Zhaoqing high tech network, the recent residential areas and", "timestamp": 1653249819, "digest": "tKJe_GwMUjlKaJucsGSOtt3bN22g8zfIlKZp8E2we8c", "contributor": "0xC22CbeF481FfC030331bACEb3D34c94bc45cc30C"}

When the baby’s awareness of defecation control has not yet occurred, physiological needs dominate. Defecation is a reflex activity. If the defecation reflex is often inhibited, it will gradually make the rectum lose its normal sensitivity to fecal pressure stimulation. Children around the age of 1 often neglect to excrete feces because of fun, so that the feces stay in the large intestine for too long, and the water in the feces is absorbed and becomes dry and hard. As a result, it is not easy to excrete, which is also one of the most common reasons for constipation. It is important to establish good defecation habits as soon as possible and develop the habit of regular defecation in the morning. It must be noted that children’s self-control awareness of defecation is formed earlier than that of urination.\n\nAfter seven months, the child has learned to sit independently and sit more stably. Generally, children behave before defecation. They may suddenly turn red around their eyes, daze in their eyes, twist their body, turn their corners of their mouth to both sides, and even fart. At this time, you can practice your child’s defecation in the basin, and adults can hold him on one side. Once the child has defecated, he must be kissed to let the child gradually know that his parents like this defecation and feel comfortable. After that, every day, parents put their children on the bedpan to defecate at about the same time, and use language and expression to signal their children to defecate hard downward. A few weeks later, as soon as the child sits on the bedpan, his nervous system will produce a conditioned reflex and urge him to defecate hard downward, so as to form a good habit of defecating in the bedpan every day. After the age of 1, gradually train children to express their need to defecate in language. Such training will take some time. Parents should be patient. If properly trained, children can complete toilet training around the age of 2.\n\nTry to arrange the time of defecation in the morning. The time of sitting in the basin each time should be about 5 minutes, not more than 10 minutes, so as not to cause the child’s disgust. After the child is 1 year old, you can buy a small toilet ring and put it on the adult’s big toilet ring to train the child to sit in the toilet and defecate. If parents train well and there is no special change in diet, children will defecate at a fixed time. Generally speaking, children can control their urine and urine well only at the age of 2 \\~ 2.5.", "timestamp": 1653250340, "digest": "IQo029_tyOLxk-riEX8ggJ1_KTnMcvHikLxlqpqMYYU", "contributor": "0xa49812D5EFc028469701b34F49101008960Bf796"}

From scheme design to construction, China has created one by one, breaking the limit of the world’s Offshore Bridge Engineering.\n\nThe total length of the Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge is about 55 kilometers, of which the main works include 22.9 kilometers of bridges, 6.7 kilometers of subsea tunnels and east-west artificial islands connecting tunnels and bridges.\n\nCCTV reporter Wu Jie: my current position is the dongrengong island of the Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge. Above my head are the dense takeoff and landing routes of the Hong Kong International Airport. Behind me is the busy golden waterway on Lingdingyang. Many bridge experts believe that it is almost an impossible task to link the core areas of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao and avoid affecting the sea and air transportation here.\n\nIn order to realize the non-interference of sea, land and air traffic, the Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge adopts the world’s first integrated scheme of bridge, island and tunnel. On the vast sea, engineers surrounded two artificial islands of 100000 square meters with 120 huge steel cylinders with a diameter of 22 meters and a height of 18 floors. The whole project took only 212 days.\n\nThe 6.7-kilometer-long subsea tunnel is composed of 33 large immersed tubes docked on the seabed. Each immersed tube weighs more than 80000 tons, which is equivalent to an aircraft carrier, and the accuracy of immersed tube docking should reach the centimeter level. These are unprecedented technological innovations in the history of bridge construction in the world\n\nSu quanke, chief engineer of Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge Authority: bridges, tunnels and artificial islands are accurately manufactured in factories, and large-scale equipment is pulled over and installed. Therefore, the quality of this bridge is very high, which pushes China’s bridge construction to the level of industrial construction. We were very surprised that foreign experts could come to China to build bridges at this time.\n\nIn terms of the overall bridge design, the main bridge of Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge is largely constructed of prefabricated steel structure, with a total steel consumption of 420000 tons, which is enough to build ten bird nests. The exquisite construction technology makes the service life of the bridge up to 120 years, which is 20 years longer than the common design service life of sea crossing bridges in the world, and has become a new benchmark for bridge construction in the world.\n\nTan Guoshun, project manager of Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge project of China Railway Bridge Bureau: the requirements for the accuracy of each component are higher and higher. If the deviation is large, it can’t be installed. The requirement of 1 cm deviation (installation) proposed by Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge is unimaginable in the process of large-scale engineering construction in the world. The technical standard of Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge is much higher than that of any country in the world.\n\nAfter the completion and opening of the Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge, the land transportation from Hong Kong to Zhuhai will be reduced from the previous three hours to 30 minutes. This super project on Lingdingyang will rewrite the economic territory of the Pearl River Delta and lay a solid foundation for the integration of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao.", "timestamp": 1653250485, "digest": "iErnMQYUcnubiVyMlbHffpCFzgnvZf4wyH8Ps-Tmfd8", "contributor": "0xa10509Ce5fcC91169CeB5b07298598aab5c03A7a"}

What is the hidden worry of lithium iron phosphate surplus?", "body": "“In 2022, due to the shortage of raw materials, the arrival of overcapacity will be delayed to a certain extent. After 2023, with the gradual easing of the tight supply of lithium carbonate, the problem of overcapacity will be faced at that time.”\n\nAfter nearly two years of rapid development, lithium iron phosphate cathode material seems to be sliding to the quagmire of overcapacity step by step.\n\nAccording to Gaogong lithium battery, from January to March 2022 alone, there were 9 domestic projects involving lithium iron phosphate materials, with a planned capacity of 1.19 million tons. The chairman of a listed company of lithium battery cathode materials said, “our demand is at the level of millions of tons, while the supply starts at more than millions of tons.” The fund manager of a new energy industry in Shanghai also believes that “due to the large increase of production capacity, the capacity of lithium iron phosphate may be surplus in the second half of 2022.”\n\nWhen will the situation of excess capacity of lithium iron phosphate appear? What impact will it have on the upstream and downstream enterprises of the industrial chain?\n\nNew and old players compete to expand production, and the planned production capacity far exceeds the demand\n\nBenefiting from the rapid development of new energy vehicles and energy storage industry, China’s lithium iron phosphate battery shipment exceeded 160gwh in 2021, with a year-on-year increase of more than 150%; Lithium iron phosphate cathode material shipments 470000 tons, an increase of 277%.\n\nCinda Securities said that under the influence of the rapid rise of raw material prices and the decline of subsidies, the cost advantage of battery materials is highlighted. Lithium iron phosphate will continue its rapid growth trend in 2022. It is estimated that the global demand for lithium iron phosphate will reach 1.81 million tons by 2025.\n\nHowever, according to the incomplete statistics of battery China, the expanded production scale of lithium iron phosphate announced by various manufacturers and the existing production capacity have exceeded 5 million tons, and the planned production capacity is significantly higher than the demand.\n\nIt is reported that the production expansion of lithium iron phosphate cathode materials mainly comes from three types of manufacturers:\n\n1) Manufacturers whose main business is lithium iron phosphate, such as German nano (300769. SZ), Hunan Yuneng, etc.\n\n2) Chemical enterprises with lithium iron phosphate business, such as Longbai group (002601. SZ), Chuanfa longmang (002312.

SZ), etc.\n\nFrom the perspective of competition pattern, according to the data of Gaogong lithium battery, the market share of lithium ferrite material top5 in 2021 was 64%, down 19 percentage points from 2020 (83%). Among them, the total shipment proportion of top2 was 40%, down only 2 percentage points, and the market share of top3-5 was significantly reduced from 40% to 24%.\n\nCinda Securities believes that with the gradual release of new production capacity of chemical enterprises, the market concentration may continue to show a downward trend.\n\nWhen the shortage of raw materials or delay the surplus time point, cost reduction PK is inevitable\n\nIn fact, behind the large-scale expansion of lithium iron phosphate material capacity, the shortage of raw materials is an indisputable fact.\n\nIn terms of lithium carbonate, according to the latest data released by the customs, the import volume of lithium carbonate in China in the first quarter of 2022 was 27497 tons, a year-on-year increase of 43.7%. Guojin Securities said that at present, the increment of the production end is quite limited, and there is still a shortage in 2022.\n\nIn terms of phosphate rock, since the second half of 2021, Yuntianhua, Wengfu group, kaiphosphorus group and some enterprises in Hubei have stopped selling or significantly reduced the take out volume of phosphate rock. At the same time, they have to purchase some medium and high-grade phosphate rock, resulting in less phosphate rock circulating in the market. At present, many phosphorus chemical enterprises reflect that it is very difficult to purchase phosphate rock.\n\nIn terms of iron phosphate, the expansion cycle is longer, 12-18 months, while the expansion cycle of lithium iron phosphate is 6-8 months. Therefore, the relative capacity of iron phosphate is lower in the short term.\n\n“In 2022, due to the shortage of raw materials, the arrival of overcapacity will be delayed to a certain extent. After 2023, with the gradual easing of the tight supply of lithium carbonate, the problem of overcapacity will be faced at that time. Moreover, this is the overcapacity of the industry, and the profit margin of industry leaders will also be affected.” There are new industry analysts said.\n\nA senior employee in the industry also believes that the problems of overcapacity superimposed on raw materials and cash flow will be gradually exposed. The road behind lithium iron phosphate is very difficult, and many small enterprises will be merged after 2023.\n\nHow will new and old players of lithium iron phosphate deal with the situation of overcapacity at that time?\n\nFirst finance called German nano, Fulin Seiko and other enterprises. As of the press time, no reply has been received.\n\nXingfa group (600141. SH) said that after overcapacity in the future, the impact on the company depends on the cost, market price, product scale and other factors of manufacturing lithium iron phosphate.\n\nThe above-mentioned fund manager of Hushang new energy industry told China first finance and economics that the lithium iron phosphate processing link is surplus, the profit probability will be compressed, and all enterprises may usher in cost reduction PK. Enterprises with integrated layout have certain advantages. At the same time, with the decline of product prices, enterprises will have more or less pressure, followed by the exchange of quantity for price.\n\nIn fact, in order to reduce costs and increase efficiency, cathode material enterprises have expanded upstream and downstream. Taking German nano as an example, the company plans to invest 800 million yuan to build a 200000 ton / year lithium iron phosphate precursor project in Qujing, Yunnan, and cooperate with Ningde times and Yiwei lithium energy in the downstream. It is reported that the Defang Yiwei factory, which the company cooperates with Yiwei lithium energy, is the cathode material project with the largest monomer capacity in China.\n\nHunan Yuneng, Hubei Wanrun and anda technology have also announced the layout of iron phosphate business.\n\nChemical enterprises with cross-border layout are expected to give full play to their own advantages of integration. Such as iron source advantages of Longbai group, anada and other titanium dioxide enterprises; Phosphorus source advantages of phosphorus chemical enterprises such as Xingfa group and Yuntianhua.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the overcapacity of lithium iron phosphate undoubtedly means an opportunity to improve profits for downstream power battery enterprises. Some people in the power battery industry said that if lithium iron phosphate has excess capacity, the cost will drop for battery enterprises. The above fund managers also believe that the overcapacity of lithium iron phosphate will benefit the power battery enterprises.\n\nAccording to the data of China automotive power battery industry innovation alliance, the installed capacity of lithium iron phosphate batteries in China totaled 79.8gwh in 2021, accounting for 51.7%, which exceeded that of ternary batteries. In April 2022, the installed capacity of lithium iron phosphate power battery in China was 18.6gwh, with a year-on-year increase of 200.7%.", "timestamp": 1653250858, "digest": "6i4fg5H-hg0r-nKvFnFjilLmY-NX_ZH2KXDg4lmcf2s", "contributor": "0xcf8666a2CDDd7ea7F3383F98eD9bC946DBf3C482"}

But in order to use them appropriately, we need to fully understand our biological limitations — not just as a vague concept. This graph made it real for us.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1310/0\\*2QTq36S0vUpkR1C9)\n\nAre you pretty sure you want kids but feel like *really* thinking about it is a “later you” problem? Have you heard about IVF or surrogacy and thought, “I should probably actually understand what that entails,” but never followed up? Do you get a little pit in your stomach when someone mentions egg freezing and think, “should I be looking into that?”\n\nIf any of these ring true for you, no worries, we are totally with you. It is completely normal to put off thinking about this stuff when it doesn’t feel particularly relevant or pressing! That said, we focused our [graduate thesis](https://soeithelp.stanford.edu/design-impact) research on enabling women to make informed decisions about their fertility and family planning. In interviewing dozens of women ages 21–40 over the past year, we’ve started to realize that pushing off thinking about this stuff is leading to what we now call “Oh Sh\\*t” moments down the road, when suddenly options for having kids can feel a lot more limited and women ask themselves “when was I supposed to be planning for this?”\n\nAt the same time, women we interviewed who were not yet thinking about children reported feeling like they *should* be and asked us to share back with them what we found. There seems to be a general sense of “I should know more,” but not a lot of guidance on what to learn.\n\nSo, that said, we’re here to share a few things we’ve learned with you throughout our research so that we can all start clarifying our desires and understanding our options before we hit any sort of panic zone around fertility. This is in no way pushing anyone to have children, or to set hard-and-fast timelines, but just to help us all start having realistic conversations with ourselves around how our lives could play out, with a few guiding questions along the way.\n\n## 1: The Disney Princess Complex and Preventing the “Oh Sh\\*t” Moment\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/The-Oh-Sht-Moment-e1ilpti)\n\n## What is the “Disney princess” complex?\n\nWe’ll preface by pointing out that we didn’t come up with this term. It has been a headline before, but different groups have defined it in different ways. Some describe it as causing body image issues and an obsession with looks. Others (mostly male blogs) say it causes unrealistic expectations in dating. What *we* are calling the disney princess complex is the idea that we are socialized to believe once we fall in love, everything will fall into place in our lives and we’ll live happily ever after — a whimsical approach to dating and potential family-building.\n\nOver the past few decades we’ve actually come a pretty long way in moving away from this narrative in how we think about relationships, since it’s obviously becoming more and more normal to be independent and career-focused and not just wait around for a man to save us. And beyond that, it’s way more accepted to be queer, not get married, or have different relationship structures like polyamory or open relationships.\n\nBut while narratives around what it means to be a woman in the world have shifted, our narratives around children have not. We’re still conditioned to believe that if we have a partner who loves us, kids will just work out when the time is right, like we see in fairytales. Or beyond fairytales, what we’ve seen with the generations before us. But as the “right time” for kids gets pushed due to later marriages, career aspirations, and financial constraints, for a lot of people it has become an experience far from a fairytale. The Disney princess influence on family “just working out” does not match our current reality, and provides a pretty unrealistic narrative of what to expect. We are not Disney princesses, nor do we want to be! But until we reconcile the disconnect and start planning within our current reality, “Oh Sh\\*t” moments will continue to happen.\n\n## What is causing these “Oh Sh\\*t” moments and how can we prevent them?\n\n## Need for reproductive assistance\n\nOne [statistic](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/02news/ameriwomen.htm) to note is that the average age at which women had their first child in the US rose from 21.4 years old in 1970 to 26.9 in 2018. For fathers, it’s increased from 27 to 31. Obviously, this still sounds pretty young. I mean, we’re in our mid-twenties, but this age thing feeds into the fact that one in six couples today has trouble conceiving. And, in at least half of all cases of infertility, a [male factor](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17201-male-infertility) is a major or contributing cause. So, often, the “Oh Sh\\*t” moment in a heterosexual relationship could be getting to the point of being ready to have kids and then realizing you’re going to need some assistance if you want to have biological children–for queer couples this could be finding out how much it costs to utilize assisted reproductive technologies (ART) or realizing that you are not covered by insurance.\n\nAuthor’s note: we believe everyone should have access to fertility benefits! And abortion! True agency is the ability to say no and to say yes (check out our website [http://whohateswomen.com](http://whohateswomen.com/) for more on this).\n\n## Shift in life circumstances\n\nAnother reason for the “Oh Sh\\*t” moment comes from life changes; we’ve heard from a lot of women in their 30’s or 40’s who went through breakups or encountered other life changes and suddenly their life circumstances around children were completely different. They’d been assuming things were going to work out when the time was right, and planning for a certain version of their life, but all of a sudden they’re asking themselves questions like, am I willing to have kids on my own? Should I have frozen my eggs years ago? How important are biological children to me?\n\n## Medical diagnoses\n\nAnd finally, “Oh Sh\\*t” moments can come along with medical diagnoses. We have a really long way to go in the world of women’s healthcare to even understand what is going on with our bodies (we could do a whole separate book on that), but we’ve talked to a bunch of women who face an “Oh Sh\\*t” moment when they suddenly become aware of a medical condition, like endometriosis, PCOS, or an autoimmune disease that could affect their fertility and need to make decisions about how to handle that. This can also come about at the moment of transition for transgender folks in deciding how to handle preserving fertility if they’d like to do so.\n\n## What do I do with this information?\n\nRight, so honestly, that’s kind of the whole point of this article! We know this stuff can be super overwhelming, and it’s way easier to just be like “I’ll deal with this later”. But we’ve heard from enough women now who kept moving the goalpost of “I’ll deal with this later,” and ultimately ended up in very stressful scenarios, that we really think there is value in starting to think about this stuff earlier on.\n\nFor a lot of people, this is honestly just getting clear with yourself on some possible scenarios for how your life could play out and thinking through what you might do in that situation. Here are some examples:\n\n“I know I *really* want kids, so if I get to be in my early 30’s and I’m still really not feeling ready, maybe that’s when I get a fertility assessment to see if anything is abnormal that I should be aware of?”\n\n“I’m not sure if I want kids yet, but if I decide to have them it would likely be in my late 30’s or even early 40’s, thus IVF could be necessary. Maybe I could consider freezing my eggs at a younger age in order for that to have a higher chance of success?”\n\n“I’m queer and know I will want to use assited reproductive technologies to have children, but all of that can cost a lot of money. Maybe I could start saving or advocating for fertility benefits in my workplace?”\n\nAgain, none of this is personal or medical advice at all, but we think knowledge is power. If we can get educated on the options out there, understand the realistic costs and limitations that might exist, and reflect on how these options might fit into our own lives, then we have a lot more agency over our futures. We can avoid the “Oh Sh\\*t” moments, not miss out on options because we didn’t know or didn’t understand, and feel convicted in our decisions when it is time to make them.\n\n## 2: The Paradox of Partnership\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/The-Paradox-of-Partnership-e1ilpvg)\n\n## What is the “Paradox of Partnership?”\n\nWhen chatting with dozens of women between the ages of 21 and 40, partnership and lack of partnership are both used as reasons to delay thinking about family planning and fertility. We heard people in partnerships say “I’m not too worried about it, we’ll have these conversations once we get more serious about having kids” and people without partners say “I don’t have a partner so I don’t think about family planning yet.” Sound like you?\n\n## So, when are people planning for children?\n\nIn many cases, right before they start trying! Which, in our parents’ generation, made a bit more sense because marriage and children were essentially the default for everyone and timelines tended to move more quickly. Now, couples are waiting a lot longer not only to marry, but also to have kids. Many factors contribute to this, but according to [a study](https://modernfertility.com/modern-state-fertility-2020-sofi-career-money) by Sofi and Modern Fertility, 60% of respondents reported delaying childbearing due to not having enough money. Life costs more money nowadays, so getting to a place where we can fully provide for children is taking longer than for our parents, and we have pretty abysmal childcare support in this country to help us.\n\nOn top of that, there are higher numbers of women pursuing education and continued education, and more women working and advancing in their careers. Relationships and dating have changed, as well–in some ways it feels like we’re all slight commitment-phobes due to the rise of divorce rates we experienced with our parents’ generation.\n\nSo, all of this combined is pushing out the timeline for having kids. Which in some sense is awesome. It provides more opportunity to pursue other things outside of building a family. The only problem is that our ability to have biological children really does change over time. We can push out the timeline, but if the goalpost keeps moving back and back and back, eventually we could run into a situation where we just don’t have as many options as we did before. Most folks we’ve interviewed have pretty vague ideas of what it might look like to try to have kids at different stages of life given egg counts, fertility challenges, etc.\n\nHence, the need to plan ahead. We believe more forethought could go into what you want, outside of partnership. When you consider divorce rates averaging around 45–50%, the likelihood of raising children on your own or co-parenting from different households is actually quite high. This is not a fun statistic, but it was a reframe that helped us think through the realities of choosing to have children.\n\nWe also heard many stories of women experiencing a breakup at 35, 36, 37 with someone they thought they were going to marry and have kids with. That can’t be planned for, of course, but it’s a very real possibility–partnership is kind of a question mark! Doesn’t it feel a bit odd to hinge such a big decision on a question mark?\n\n## Yes! What do I do with this information?\n\nWe plan out almost everything else in our lives, so it’s interesting that we keep this sort of whimsical outlook of “it will fall into place!” Or “if it’s meant to be it will be” around having kids. We believe this is a conversation that is useful to have with ourselves, outside of partnership, so that we can handle possible changes in our lives with the grounding that we know what we want.\n\nWe’ve laid out some examples of guiding questions to think about with yourself, whether or not you have a partner:\n\n“I don’t have a partner at this moment and I’m like 75% sure I want kids in the future, but definitely not 100%…would I be willing to spend money on getting a fertility assessment or freezing my eggs now so that I can have some extra buffer room to decide?”\n\n“I definitely need to be on the same page about kids as my partner before marriage, but when I brought it up it kind of caught them off-guard. What do I really want kid-wise and what kind of timeline am I thinking about? What will I do if we don’t align?”\n\n“Thinking about future partners — I’d want to ask myself if I would feel confident raising a child with them if we did not stay together romantically in the future?”\n\n“What if I’m not even sure I want the 1:1 partnership model for the rest of my life? Would I consider having kids on my own? Would I want to be a “choice mom” (the new term for having children solo intentionally)?\n\n“Do I want multiple partners or a larger family unit to raise children with as a community?”\n\nNow, this is not to scare anyone or push folks to overplan. These are huge questions, and our answers can change over time. But knowing our options, being real about the various outcomes that could play out, and having a good sense of our own desires–detached from partnership–should set us up to have much more agency than if we put off thinking about children until we want to start trying.\n\n## 3: False Confidence in Options and Fertility Unit Economics\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/False-Optionality-e1ilq0l)\n\n## What is causing “false confidence” in fertility?\n\nWith rapid advancements in fertility technology and heavy investment in the space, it’s easy to believe that we will have plenty of options for conceiving when the time is right. There are some really exciting emerging technologies. However, due to high cost and mixed success rates of fertility interventions, our current options are actually less of a slam dunk than we think, and can lead to emotional and physical challenges.\n\nWe also seem to have a skewed understanding of the accessibility of these fertility interventions, partly from the influence of celebrity news and social media. In 2015, Gabrielle Union opened up about the shame she felt in prioritizing career over family building, leading her to pursue IVF in her 40’s. In 2016, Selena Gomez froze her eggs; her medical care team recommended considering the procedure before undergoing chemotherapy for Lupus. In 2018, Halsey froze her eggs at 23 due to her endometriosis diagnosis and related surgeries. In 2020, we learned more about Kim Kardashian’s fertility journey–during her first two pregnancies she experienced placenta accreta and gestational diabetes, a condition in which the placenta gets stuck inside the body during birth. Because of this, she chose to use surrogates for her third and fourth children. In 2021, we watched Heather Rae from Selling Sunsets document her fertility journey through IVF and embryo preservation on TikTok. And finally, in 2022, we learned Chrissy Teigen is using IVF to try for her third child and saw her share the all-too-common, but often private, pain of miscarriage.\n\nOn the one hand, this exposure is great. It’s passively trojan-horsing some of this fertility information to folks and normalizing conversations. But while exposure is good, it could also be giving us a false sense of security. We hear the ages of some of these celebrities and think “ah, I have all the time in the world.” However, for them, money isn’t an issue. They can afford as many cycles or procedures as it takes, and can seek out and travel to the best clinics in the world.\n\nWe also detected a lot of false confidence when speaking with women who use their mom’s story as an example of success. We heard things like, “well my mom had a kid at 39, so I’m probably good!” However, there are differences between our mothers’ generation and ours. Not only are we, on average, having kids later in life, there’s also more and more [evidence ](https://www.popsci.com/air-pollution-fertility-pregnancy/)that environmental factors like pollution affect fertility, and that fertility is generally on the decline.\n\nFertility struggles also are not limited to women. In fact, it’s a giant misconception and one that we need to set straight. In at least half of all cases of infertility, a male factor is a [major or contributing cause](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17201-male-infertility). While researchers aren’t sure what exactly is causing male-factor infertility–they mostly blame environmental factors–it is clear that male fertility is decreasing. In 1992, a [study](https://www.bmj.com/content/305/6854/609) found a global 50% decline in sperm counts in men over the previous 60 years. Multiple studies over subsequent years confirmed that initial finding, including a 2017 [paper](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/6/646/4035689) showing 50–60% decline in sperm concentration between 1973 and 2011 in men from around the world.\n\nSo what does this mean? We’re not trying to scare the shit out of everyone. But there’s no denying fertility is changing and the need for assisted reproductive technologies is increasing. We need to get real about how much different treatments cost and the likely success rates at different ages (because age matters here too) with assisted reproductive technologies like IUI, egg freezing, and IVF. With this information we can better plan, better save, and better prioritize when making life decisions, like potentially taking fertility benefits into account when job searching.\n\n## How much do fertility options really cost?\n\nTo begin, we need to make clear that most of these procedures are not covered by insurance, public or private. This is something not everyone knows. Unless it is deemed “medically necessary,” like in the case of women undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, it is not covered. And these guidelines are quite strict–we spoke with a woman undergoing chemo for an autoimmune disease who could not get egg freezing covered as “medically necessary” because it wasn’t cancer. This also typically excludes LGBTQ+ individuals who don’t meet the definitions of “infertility” that may qualify them for coverage. Even transgender individuals undergoing gender-affirming care may not meet the criteria for “infertility” that would cover them for fertility preservation (think: egg or sperm freezing).\n\nSo, most patients are paying out of pocket for these treatments, which can end up being well over $10,000, depending on the treatment. Let’s break it down. And shoutout to [FertilityIQ](https://www.fertilityiq.com/) — a super informative fertility education site that helped us source these numbers (this platform also costs money…nothing is free in this fertility world!).\n\n## IUI\n\nIUI, which stands for Intrauterine Insemination, is a procedure to put sperm directly inside the uterus, helping healthy sperm get closer to an egg. It is usually a “first try” for unexplained infertility. You may explore this if you have endometriosis or low sperm count/quality. It would also be used for same-sex female couples using donor sperm, or single women using donor sperm. It averages between $500-$4000 per cycle or “try,” essentially. The range is so wide because it can vary by medication pricing, monitoring and bloodwork, and the insemination procedure, so it mostly depends on the clinic you go to.\n\n## IVF\n\nIVF, which stands for In-Vitro Fertilization, is a procedure in which eggs and sperm are fertilized outside of the body in a test tube or petri dish, and then a viable fertilized embryo is put directly inside the uterus. It can be eggs and sperm from partners, or donor eggs / donor sperm. It is also often used with surrogates. This is often a next step in the unexplained infertility process, or for women who have fallopian tube damage/blockage, or other health concerns. IVF can cost well over $20,000 for one cycle when tallying the cost of treatment and medication–most women will average 2.1 cycles, bringing the total cost upwards of $40,000. Cost also depends on if you do genetic testing or other add-ons and is variable by clinic and by state.\n\n## Egg freezing\n\nEgg freezing is the last one we’ll cover, although there are many more fertility options. Egg freezing is a procedure in which eggs are extracted and then frozen using cryopreservation. It is used as a preservation measure, so that you can use the eggs later. You can freeze embryos (fertilized eggs) for preservation as well. On average, egg freezing patients will spend $30,000-$40,000 on treatment and storage. The breakdown is around $15,000 per cycle (to extract the eggs) and most women do an average of 2.1 cycles. Storage costs depend on location, but average around $500 per year.\n\nIt becomes even more complex when assessing the unit economics of fertility treatments. Freezing your eggs at 32 is a very different financial decision than freezing your eggs at 38, or 43 like Kourtney Kardashian. For example, you might be able to get 40 eggs in one round at age 32 for $20,000 with longer-term storage costs, and 20 eggs in three rounds at age 38 for $60,000 with reduced storage costs. We should be thinking not only about which fertility options might make sense for us, but also when those options make sense in the context of our wants and needs. It’s not fun to have to think about unit economics when thinking about the magic of having a baby! But that is exactly the kind of psychological barrier we hope to help women overcome.\n\n## So, what could I be thinking about?\n\nThere are a few companies popping up to make fertility procedures cheaper, which is exciting. That’s essentially [Kindbody’s](https://kindbody.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=kindbody&utm_term=kindbody&utm_campaign=__Kindbody+Brand&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=5349304425&hsa_cam=15158927904&hsa_grp=132895691881&hsa_ad=558827162131&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-482671827007&hsa_kw=kindbody&hsa_mt=p&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwspKUBhCvARIsAB2IYutVqaW_myuSzBGeZxOcosPqZGy-GuI_1dUAym-32IhnsXPZIIu6lHUaArX5EALw_wcB) premise–they’re improving user experience but also trying to drive down costs. But even at Kindbody, if you want to get a basic fertility assessment to find out where you’re at and if you should be worried, it can still be upwards of $300. In some states, insurance companies are required to cover a fertility assessment, so if you’re interested in getting a fertility workup done, talk to your OBGYN. They should be able to refer you to a clinic, and with that referral your insurance could cover it. But *always* ask upfront what your insurance will cover.\n\nThere are also companies like [Carrot Fertility](https://www.get-carrot.com/) or [Progyny](https://progyny.com/) that facilitate employers offering their employees fertility benefits. You could consider negotiating or advocating for fertility benefits in your current company or next job! And finally, there are companies like [Sunfish](https://joinsunfish.com/) offering financing and loans for fertility treatments.\n\nAdditionally, here are a few guiding questions you could ask yourself:\n\n“How do I feel about assisted reproductive technologies in general?”\n\n“Do I know what, if any, fertility coverage I currently have?”\n\n“If I have a partner(s), have we mutually discussed our feelings about ART? Does my partner have fertility benefits?”\n\n“I’m queer and would likely use ART to have a biological child with my partner, how might we plan for that?”\n\n“If I’m diagnosed with a fertility issue (about 10% of women have PCOS and 2–10% have endometriosis) and struggle to get pregnant naturally, how much money, if any, would I be willing to spend on assisted reproductive technology?”\n\n“Am I willing to start saving money (or advocating for benefits!) now to have a plan in place for if I might need ART?”\n\n## 4: Why We Might Not Want Kids\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/Why-We-Might-Not-Want-Kids-e1ilq28)\n\n## Let’s talk about this!\n\nObviously, it’s becoming increasingly socially acceptable to not want kids, but we don’t actually spend much structured time thinking or talking about the reasons why we do or do not want kids. We found in many cases in our interviews with women, it’s just referred to as a feeling. But where does this feeling come from? Is it subliminal social pressure? What your friends are doing? The next logical step in your relationship with your partner? Or, is it truly your own desire and intentional decision, one way or another?\n\nSo, let’s talk about why we might not want kids! Lack of a supportive partner, lifestyle and identity, climate change, and health concerns are all valid reasons for choosing not to have children and deserve some discussion to spark thoughtful reflection. And, even without children of your own, there are many ways to integrate children into your life if you still want to be around them.\n\n## Lack of supportive partner\n\nUnfortunately, the ever-present influence of traditional gender roles feeds into considerations around lack of a supportive partner. According to [happiness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness) expert Paul Dolan, a professor of behavioral science at the London School of Economics, women who are single with no children are actually the happiest. Dolan [explains](https://www.businessinsider.com/unmarried-childless-women-are-happiest-expert-says-2019-5) that while men derive benefits from [marriage](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/marriage), the same cannot generally be said for women. This statement is clearly very heteronormative and sweeping, and there are many really great marriages out there, but women are still typically the default for emotional and household labor within marriages, which gets exacerbated with children involved. Married heterosexual mothers notoriously take on more responsibilities than their male partners and very different responsibilities than their single women counterparts.\n\n## Lifestyle and identity\n\nHere, we want to touch on the concept of “regretting motherhood” which is super taboo in our society to talk about.\n\nSociologist Orna Donath published a book called [Regretting Motherhood,](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32302223-regretting-motherhood) which is a study on women who self-report regretting becoming mothers. There are many different reasons they became mothers in the first place–avoiding divorce, meeting family expectations, fitting in with friends, or simply because they thought it was the “next step”–and some of them actually did have a strong desire to be mothers before having kids, but all of them ended up regretting it when faced with the reality of motherhood.\n\nWe always hear about women who choose *not* to be mothers being warned that they will regret their decision later in life, but we really don’t talk about the possibility that the opposite could also be true — that a woman who becomes a mother might regret it. This brings us back to women dealing with most of the emotional and household labor in heterosexual relationships–the burden of childbearing often does fall primarily on the woman, which is a very real factor to consider depending on your relationship. Looking at the realities of the lifestyle changes and identity changes that come along with having kids, you might just decide you are not down for that shift and really value your autonomy, which is a completely valid choice.\n\n## Climate change\n\nClimate change is a very real consideration for a lot of folks in the decision of whether or not to have kids. In our parents’ generation, they still had plenty of societal issues going on that could make them wary of bringing children into the world (ex. war, economic stress, etc.), but it wasn’t at quite the same level of climate change–our world is fully on fire and not on track to stabilize.\n\nGiven the trajectory we’re on, there’s definitely questions of: “What kind of world am I bringing my kids into?” “Where should we live so that we’re not at constant threat of floods, fires, famine, etc., and can we even afford that?” For some, this feels more pressing than for others, but certainly we’re hearing more and more about people choosing not to have children due to climate change.\n\nWe are absolutely not trying to be doomsday here, and there’s an argument on the flip-side of all this where having children is actually a sign of sustained hope for the world, but we just want to validate the fact that you might have considered this and that you are not crazy for factoring climate into your decision-making.\n\n## Health concerns\n\nFinally, health concerns are a valid consideration. Maybe you are already dealing with a health condition that meaningfully affects your life and you do not know how a pregnancy or the stress of having children might impact your own personal health. We spoke with a woman who has a very intense autoimmune disease and is worried about taking care of a child while also trying to manage her disease. Obviously, our society should have better resources for and access to childcare, which would solve many of these problems, but within our current reality this is a serious consideration.\n\nEven the act of giving birth can come with serious health risks that are rarely talked about. [303,000](https://everymothercounts.org/our-story/the-issue/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwspKUBhCvARIsAB2IYuucoFuxdQwdJE4OyzDt4eGzFYrpU5MOFsJEDNZWagVR3FhDXp6sFzwaAhVzEALw_wcB) women die around the world as a result of complications of pregnancy and childbirth every year, and due to inequitable care, Black Women in the US have the highest [maternal mortality rate](https://usafacts.org/articles/the-us-maternal-mortality-rate-peaked-during-the-pandemic-and-was-highest-for-black-women/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=ND-Healthcare&gclid=Cj0KCQjwspKUBhCvARIsAB2IYutgrWUncb-QfJGc1JhdkS2mNZQbTxcO2t3O1wry1n1lTQJxH4B1d64aAp-VEALw_wcB), more than two times worse than that of any other racial or ethnic group.\n\nAdditionally, we are not told much about birthing until it happens to us. Even with more and more women opening up about the realities of childbirth on social media, we are still wildly uninformed when it comes to what happens to our bodies during and after childbirth. Even miscarriages are taboo, yet 10–20% of known pregnancies end in them. For some women, this might have a meaningful impact on whether or not they want to be a birthing parent and thus it should not remain a taboo topic.\n\n## What can I be thinking about?\n\nSo, there are a lot of reasons you might not want kids. We have a really strong narrative in society that parenthood will be the best thing that ever happened to you. However, we heard a quote recently that we loved along the lines of, “We are told parenthood will be the best thing that ever happened to you, but if you don’t become a parent or don’t want to,\\* something else \\*will be the best thing that ever happened to you.” You’ll always have a best thing! The best thing is not the same for everyone.\n\nThe status quo and cultural expectation is still to have children, but women are still sacrificing the most with having kids. So we hope that the decision of whether or not to have kids becomes more intentional– one you truly have conviction in. Also, experiencing the positive impacts of “nurturing” something does not have to be children. It could be nurturing your relationships, your community, the world in whatever way feels right to you. Or, if you are really inclined to nurture children, there are a million ways to integrate kids into your life even if they are not your own.\n\nHere are some guiding questions to consider:\n\n“Have I thought about all the ways my lifestyle would change if I were to have kids? Am I okay with that? “\n\n“Do I want kids of my own or just kids in my life in general?”\n\n“Do I feel like I would be taking on the role of primary caregiver in my relationship if we were to have kids, and if so, am I okay with that?”\n\n“Do I feel that bringing a child into the world is something I’m comfortable with given my own personal feelings about the trajectory our world is on?”\n\n“Does having the right partner meaningfully impact whether or not I would want kids?”\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nUltimately, the goal of this article is to help women avoid the “Oh Sh\\*t” moment we keep hearing about, where they get totally blindsided by fertility challenges. And again, you can have babies at any age and in a lot of different ways–we just want everyone to understand the options that are available to them and empower everyone to become their own advocate!\n\n## Please reach out if this brought anything up for you or if you have any questions!", "timestamp": 1653251904, "digest": "_DoeT7tVEMYnXe0R3156V0S9AKYoJb3xdw_cSY4SAVE", "contributor": "0xa0C3a5E5e25dDE1148296d8c3971e17009b45ccF"}

Su kejing, director of the Department of soil ecological environment of the Ministry of ecological environment, said that he would deeply fight the tough battle of agricultural and rural pollution control, give full play to the role of the government, the market and villagers, and speed up the filling of weaknesses. By 2025, the national rural domestic sewage treatment rate will reach 40%.\n\nSu kejing said that in recent years, the Ministry of ecological environment, together with relevant departments, has formulated plans according to local conditions, popularized typical experience and practices, accelerated the establishment of rural domestic sewage treatment system, and achieved preliminary results. “But on the whole, the foundation of rural domestic sewage treatment is weak and the task is still arduous. By 2021, the rural domestic sewage treatment rate is only about 28%.” In this regard, the Ministry of ecology and environment will further fight the tough battle of agricultural and rural pollution control and speed up the filling of weaknesses. By 2025, the national rural domestic sewage treatment rate will reach 40%.\n\nFirst, give play to the leading role of local governments. Strengthen the overall connection, take the county as the unit, comprehensively manage the rural domestic sewage, and organically connect with toilet improvement, urban development, rural construction, land and space planning, etc.\n\nSecond, give play to the main role of the market. Follow the economic law, let the main body, projects, funds and other elements live, and operate in a market-oriented and sustainable manner. Qualified areas can entrust professional institutions to comprehensively implement rural domestic sewage treatment and improve the level of large-scale operation.\n\nThird, give full play to the role of villagers’ participation. Fully respect the farmers’ rights to know, participate and supervise, and enhance their sense of ownership. Give full play to the organization and coordination role of the two village committees, and organize villagers to participate in sewage treatment planning, construction, operation and management through fund-raising and labor raising, so as to get through the “last kilometer”.\n\nMassive information and accurate interpretation are all in Sina Finance app", "timestamp": 1653251846, "digest": "fGzyeK-iKxrKGzeabK_Z9CSYO_-B50wuT04nbBfR7ok", "contributor": "0xFDb3E6aabd9541D7110cc61c7326B3DB531C889a"}

A few days ago, the seminar on “digital twin city framework and global practice” held by the Chinese Academy of information and communications was successfully held. Yu Xiaohui, President of the Chinese Academy of information and communications, pointed out in his speech that digital twin cities are an important direction for the development and evolution of smart cities.\n\nWhen the digital twin and smart city met, the spark of landing application was finally detonated, and the digital twin officially evolved from a technical concept to a new transformation path.\n\nKey points of digital twin smart city construction\n\nWith the rapid development of Internet of things, cloud computing, big data and other information technologies in recent years, the objective technical conditions for building a smart city have matured. The digital twin smart city, as the advanced stage of smart city, is to drive the reconstruction of the city with 5g, AI and other scientific and technological means, digitize, platform and label the urban twin, and reshape urban planning and management from a new perspective of integration.\n\nIn recent years, digital twin cities are accelerating their landing and become an important direction of urban form evolution in the future. On the one hand, “building a digital twin city” has risen to a national height. The outline of China’s 14th five year plan clearly points out that “improve the urban information model platform and operation management service platform, build the urban data resource system, promote the construction of urban data brain” and “explore the construction of digital twin city”, which has created a good development environment for urban digital twin. On the other hand, at present, digital twin technology has been applied to urban architecture, transportation infrastructure and other building types, digital twin base construction of different scale levels, and has created a variety of application scenarios such as digital twin Industrial Park, digital twin ecological park and digital twin park.\n\n“Green code link, face capture, AI recognition…” the “5g + Digital twin smart community” project, which promotes the modernization of grass-roots governance system and governance capacity with 5g, big data, cloud computing, Internet of things, artificial intelligence and other technologies, has been implemented in Shuangliu District, Chengdu. This is a vivid practice for China Telecom to give full play to digitization to help the government’s digital transformation.\n\nIn fact, this is only an epitome of the digital twin field of operators. In the 5g era, digital twin technology and application have been promoted to a strategic level. As the main force of digital economy construction, operators are constantly building leading examples in the field of digital twin. For example, China Telecom’s “5g + MEC” smart business cloud XR digital twin platform has been implemented in more than 100 cities across the country; The first city level IOT platform built by China Telecom in xiong’an has become the base of realizing digital twin city in xiong’an new area; China Mobile released the 2030 + vision and needs report, which proposed the 6G vision of “digital twins and ubiquitous wisdom”, the “six characteristics” of 6G network and the “three layers and four sides” 6G network logical architecture; China Unicom led the relevant work of the urban safety laboratory in xiong’an new area and carried out the exploration of new strategies, new technologies and new theories of digital twin urban safety.\n\nPromoting co construction and sharing is the only way\n\nThe value of digital twin is mainly realized through digital top-level design and digital operation. Therefore, we should pay more attention to building the infrastructure system of smart city. 5g is an important foundation to support the virtual real interaction of digital twins. As the main force of digital economy construction, operators should first provide excellent cases of building various leading digital operation systems for the shared and co constructed network under 5g new infrastructure, promote the popularization of applications, publicize the application achievements of digital twins, strengthen the real-world display of digital twins, and encourage the industrial Internet Innovation Exhibition Center to integrate digital twins solutions.\n\nIn addition, at present, most of the key technologies related to digital twins are in the hands of foreign enterprises, such as sensor technology, CAD technology, CAE technology, PLM technology, VR / AR technology, etc. Therefore, operators should pool the forces of politics, industry, University and research, speed up the formulation of the overall architecture of digital twins, strengthen the top-level design, actively participate in the formulation of the reference architecture of digital twins, and seize the right to formulate international standards of digital twins.", "timestamp": 1653251961, "digest": "b6gdjoIv0H1_eRZLZAefhRA17yC1v6UwXhdGVmGLoUI", "contributor": "0x72a04836aFD242c755cDB39E149D0f267a31f80e"}

But in order to use them appropriately, we need to fully understand our biological limitations — not just as a vague concept. This graph made it real for us.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1310/0\\*2QTq36S0vUpkR1C9)\n\nAre you pretty sure you want kids but feel like *really* thinking about it is a “later you” problem? Have you heard about IVF or surrogacy and thought, “I should probably actually understand what that entails,” but never followed up? Do you get a little pit in your stomach when someone mentions egg freezing and think, “should I be looking into that?”\n\nIf any of these ring true for you, no worries, we are totally with you. It is completely normal to put off thinking about this stuff when it doesn’t feel particularly relevant or pressing! That said, we focused our [graduate thesis](https://soeithelp.stanford.edu/design-impact) research on enabling women to make informed decisions about their fertility and family planning. In interviewing dozens of women ages 21–40 over the past year, we’ve started to realize that pushing off thinking about this stuff is leading to what we now call “Oh Sh\\*t” moments down the road, when suddenly options for having kids can feel a lot more limited and women ask themselves “when was I supposed to be planning for this?”\n\nAt the same time, women we interviewed who were not yet thinking about children reported feeling like they *should* be and asked us to share back with them what we found. There seems to be a general sense of “I should know more,” but not a lot of guidance on what to learn.\n\nSo, that said, we’re here to share a few things we’ve learned with you throughout our research so that we can all start clarifying our desires and understanding our options before we hit any sort of panic zone around fertility. This is in no way pushing anyone to have children, or to set hard-and-fast timelines, but just to help us all start having realistic conversations with ourselves around how our lives could play out, with a few guiding questions along the way.\n\n## 1: The Disney Princess Complex and Preventing the “Oh Sh\\*t” Moment\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/The-Oh-Sht-Moment-e1ilpti)\n\n## What is the “Disney princess” complex?\n\nWe’ll preface by pointing out that we didn’t come up with this term. It has been a headline before, but different groups have defined it in different ways. Some describe it as causing body image issues and an obsession with looks. Others (mostly male blogs) say it causes unrealistic expectations in dating. What *we* are calling the disney princess complex is the idea that we are socialized to believe once we fall in love, everything will fall into place in our lives and we’ll live happily ever after — a whimsical approach to dating and potential family-building.\n\nOver the past few decades we’ve actually come a pretty long way in moving away from this narrative in how we think about relationships, since it’s obviously becoming more and more normal to be independent and career-focused and not just wait around for a man to save us. And beyond that, it’s way more accepted to be queer, not get married, or have different relationship structures like polyamory or open relationships.\n\nBut while narratives around what it means to be a woman in the world have shifted, our narratives around children have not. We’re still conditioned to believe that if we have a partner who loves us, kids will just work out when the time is right, like we see in fairytales. Or beyond fairytales, what we’ve seen with the generations before us. But as the “right time” for kids gets pushed due to later marriages, career aspirations, and financial constraints, for a lot of people it has become an experience far from a fairytale. The Disney princess influence on family “just working out” does not match our current reality, and provides a pretty unrealistic narrative of what to expect. We are not Disney princesses, nor do we want to be! But until we reconcile the disconnect and start planning within our current reality, “Oh Sh\\*t” moments will continue to happen.\n\n## What is causing these “Oh Sh\\*t” moments and how can we prevent them?\n\n## Need for reproductive assistance\n\nOne [statistic](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/02news/ameriwomen.htm) to note is that the average age at which women had their first child in the US rose from 21.4 years old in 1970 to 26.9 in 2018. For fathers, it’s increased from 27 to 31. Obviously, this still sounds pretty young. I mean, we’re in our mid-twenties, but this age thing feeds into the fact that one in six couples today has trouble conceiving. And, in at least half of all cases of infertility, a [male factor](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17201-male-infertility) is a major or contributing cause. So, often, the “Oh Sh\\*t” moment in a heterosexual relationship could be getting to the point of being ready to have kids and then realizing you’re going to need some assistance if you want to have biological children–for queer couples this could be finding out how much it costs to utilize assisted reproductive technologies (ART) or realizing that you are not covered by insurance.\n\nAuthor’s note: we believe everyone should have access to fertility benefits! And abortion! True agency is the ability to say no and to say yes (check out our website [http://whohateswomen.com](http://whohateswomen.com/) for more on this).\n\n## Shift in life circumstances\n\nAnother reason for the “Oh Sh\\*t” moment comes from life changes; we’ve heard from a lot of women in their 30’s or 40’s who went through breakups or encountered other life changes and suddenly their life circumstances around children were completely different. They’d been assuming things were going to work out when the time was right, and planning for a certain version of their life, but all of a sudden they’re asking themselves questions like, am I willing to have kids on my own? Should I have frozen my eggs years ago? How important are biological children to me?\n\n## Medical diagnoses\n\nAnd finally, “Oh Sh\\*t” moments can come along with medical diagnoses. We have a really long way to go in the world of women’s healthcare to even understand what is going on with our bodies (we could do a whole separate book on that), but we’ve talked to a bunch of women who face an “Oh Sh\\*t” moment when they suddenly become aware of a medical condition, like endometriosis, PCOS, or an autoimmune disease that could affect their fertility and need to make decisions about how to handle that. This can also come about at the moment of transition for transgender folks in deciding how to handle preserving fertility if they’d like to do so.\n\n## What do I do with this information?\n\nRight, so honestly, that’s kind of the whole point of this article! We know this stuff can be super overwhelming, and it’s way easier to just be like “I’ll deal with this later”. But we’ve heard from enough women now who kept moving the goalpost of “I’ll deal with this later,” and ultimately ended up in very stressful scenarios, that we really think there is value in starting to think about this stuff earlier on.\n\nFor a lot of people, this is honestly just getting clear with yourself on some possible scenarios for how your life could play out and thinking through what you might do in that situation. Here are some examples:\n\n“I know I *really* want kids, so if I get to be in my early 30’s and I’m still really not feeling ready, maybe that’s when I get a fertility assessment to see if anything is abnormal that I should be aware of?”\n\n“I’m not sure if I want kids yet, but if I decide to have them it would likely be in my late 30’s or even early 40’s, thus IVF could be necessary. Maybe I could consider freezing my eggs at a younger age in order for that to have a higher chance of success?”\n\n“I’m queer and know I will want to use assited reproductive technologies to have children, but all of that can cost a lot of money. Maybe I could start saving or advocating for fertility benefits in my workplace?”\n\nAgain, none of this is personal or medical advice at all, but we think knowledge is power. If we can get educated on the options out there, understand the realistic costs and limitations that might exist, and reflect on how these options might fit into our own lives, then we have a lot more agency over our futures. We can avoid the “Oh Sh\\*t” moments, not miss out on options because we didn’t know or didn’t understand, and feel convicted in our decisions when it is time to make them.\n\n## 2: The Paradox of Partnership\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/The-Paradox-of-Partnership-e1ilpvg)\n\n## What is the “Paradox of Partnership?”\n\nWhen chatting with dozens of women between the ages of 21 and 40, partnership and lack of partnership are both used as reasons to delay thinking about family planning and fertility. We heard people in partnerships say “I’m not too worried about it, we’ll have these conversations once we get more serious about having kids” and people without partners say “I don’t have a partner so I don’t think about family planning yet.” Sound like you?\n\n## So, when are people planning for children?\n\nIn many cases, right before they start trying! Which, in our parents’ generation, made a bit more sense because marriage and children were essentially the default for everyone and timelines tended to move more quickly. Now, couples are waiting a lot longer not only to marry, but also to have kids. Many factors contribute to this, but according to [a study](https://modernfertility.com/modern-state-fertility-2020-sofi-career-money) by Sofi and Modern Fertility, 60% of respondents reported delaying childbearing due to not having enough money. Life costs more money nowadays, so getting to a place where we can fully provide for children is taking longer than for our parents, and we have pretty abysmal childcare support in this country to help us.\n\nOn top of that, there are higher numbers of women pursuing education and continued education, and more women working and advancing in their careers. Relationships and dating have changed, as well–in some ways it feels like we’re all slight commitment-phobes due to the rise of divorce rates we experienced with our parents’ generation.\n\nSo, all of this combined is pushing out the timeline for having kids. Which in some sense is awesome. It provides more opportunity to pursue other things outside of building a family. The only problem is that our ability to have biological children really does change over time. We can push out the timeline, but if the goalpost keeps moving back and back and back, eventually we could run into a situation where we just don’t have as many options as we did before. Most folks we’ve interviewed have pretty vague ideas of what it might look like to try to have kids at different stages of life given egg counts, fertility challenges, etc.\n\nHence, the need to plan ahead. We believe more forethought could go into what you want, outside of partnership. When you consider divorce rates averaging around 45–50%, the likelihood of raising children on your own or co-parenting from different households is actually quite high. This is not a fun statistic, but it was a reframe that helped us think through the realities of choosing to have children.\n\nWe also heard many stories of women experiencing a breakup at 35, 36, 37 with someone they thought they were going to marry and have kids with. That can’t be planned for, of course, but it’s a very real possibility–partnership is kind of a question mark! Doesn’t it feel a bit odd to hinge such a big decision on a question mark?\n\n## Yes! What do I do with this information?\n\nWe plan out almost everything else in our lives, so it’s interesting that we keep this sort of whimsical outlook of “it will fall into place!” Or “if it’s meant to be it will be” around having kids. We believe this is a conversation that is useful to have with ourselves, outside of partnership, so that we can handle possible changes in our lives with the grounding that we know what we want.\n\nWe’ve laid out some examples of guiding questions to think about with yourself, whether or not you have a partner:\n\n“I don’t have a partner at this moment and I’m like 75% sure I want kids in the future, but definitely not 100%…would I be willing to spend money on getting a fertility assessment or freezing my eggs now so that I can have some extra buffer room to decide?”\n\n“I definitely need to be on the same page about kids as my partner before marriage, but when I brought it up it kind of caught them off-guard. What do I really want kid-wise and what kind of timeline am I thinking about? What will I do if we don’t align?”\n\n“Thinking about future partners — I’d want to ask myself if I would feel confident raising a child with them if we did not stay together romantically in the future?”\n\n“What if I’m not even sure I want the 1:1 partnership model for the rest of my life? Would I consider having kids on my own? Would I want to be a “choice mom” (the new term for having children solo intentionally)?\n\n“Do I want multiple partners or a larger family unit to raise children with as a community?”\n\nNow, this is not to scare anyone or push folks to overplan. These are huge questions, and our answers can change over time. But knowing our options, being real about the various outcomes that could play out, and having a good sense of our own desires–detached from partnership–should set us up to have much more agency than if we put off thinking about children until we want to start trying.\n\n## 3: False Confidence in Options and Fertility Unit Economics\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/False-Optionality-e1ilq0l)\n\n## What is causing “false confidence” in fertility?\n\nWith rapid advancements in fertility technology and heavy investment in the space, it’s easy to believe that we will have plenty of options for conceiving when the time is right. There are some really exciting emerging technologies. However, due to high cost and mixed success rates of fertility interventions, our current options are actually less of a slam dunk than we think, and can lead to emotional and physical challenges.\n\nWe also seem to have a skewed understanding of the accessibility of these fertility interventions, partly from the influence of celebrity news and social media. In 2015, Gabrielle Union opened up about the shame she felt in prioritizing career over family building, leading her to pursue IVF in her 40’s. In 2016, Selena Gomez froze her eggs; her medical care team recommended considering the procedure before undergoing chemotherapy for Lupus. In 2018, Halsey froze her eggs at 23 due to her endometriosis diagnosis and related surgeries. In 2020, we learned more about Kim Kardashian’s fertility journey–during her first two pregnancies she experienced placenta accreta and gestational diabetes, a condition in which the placenta gets stuck inside the body during birth. Because of this, she chose to use surrogates for her third and fourth children. In 2021, we watched Heather Rae from Selling Sunsets document her fertility journey through IVF and embryo preservation on TikTok. And finally, in 2022, we learned Chrissy Teigen is using IVF to try for her third child and saw her share the all-too-common, but often private, pain of miscarriage.\n\nOn the one hand, this exposure is great. It’s passively trojan-horsing some of this fertility information to folks and normalizing conversations. But while exposure is good, it could also be giving us a false sense of security. We hear the ages of some of these celebrities and think “ah, I have all the time in the world.” However, for them, money isn’t an issue. They can afford as many cycles or procedures as it takes, and can seek out and travel to the best clinics in the world.\n\nWe also detected a lot of false confidence when speaking with women who use their mom’s story as an example of success. We heard things like, “well my mom had a kid at 39, so I’m probably good!” However, there are differences between our mothers’ generation and ours. Not only are we, on average, having kids later in life, there’s also more and more [evidence ](https://www.popsci.com/air-pollution-fertility-pregnancy/)that environmental factors like pollution affect fertility, and that fertility is generally on the decline.\n\nFertility struggles also are not limited to women. In fact, it’s a giant misconception and one that we need to set straight. In at least half of all cases of infertility, a male factor is a [major or contributing cause](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17201-male-infertility). While researchers aren’t sure what exactly is causing male-factor infertility–they mostly blame environmental factors–it is clear that male fertility is decreasing. In 1992, a [study](https://www.bmj.com/content/305/6854/609) found a global 50% decline in sperm counts in men over the previous 60 years. Multiple studies over subsequent years confirmed that initial finding, including a 2017 [paper](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/6/646/4035689) showing 50–60% decline in sperm concentration between 1973 and 2011 in men from around the world.\n\nSo what does this mean? We’re not trying to scare the shit out of everyone. But there’s no denying fertility is changing and the need for assisted reproductive technologies is increasing. We need to get real about how much different treatments cost and the likely success rates at different ages (because age matters here too) with assisted reproductive technologies like IUI, egg freezing, and IVF. With this information we can better plan, better save, and better prioritize when making life decisions, like potentially taking fertility benefits into account when job searching.\n\n## How much do fertility options really cost?\n\nTo begin, we need to make clear that most of these procedures are not covered by insurance, public or private. This is something not everyone knows. Unless it is deemed “medically necessary,” like in the case of women undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, it is not covered. And these guidelines are quite strict–we spoke with a woman undergoing chemo for an autoimmune disease who could not get egg freezing covered as “medically necessary” because it wasn’t cancer. This also typically excludes LGBTQ+ individuals who don’t meet the definitions of “infertility” that may qualify them for coverage. Even transgender individuals undergoing gender-affirming care may not meet the criteria for “infertility” that would cover them for fertility preservation (think: egg or sperm freezing).\n\nSo, most patients are paying out of pocket for these treatments, which can end up being well over $10,000, depending on the treatment. Let’s break it down. And shoutout to [FertilityIQ](https://www.fertilityiq.com/) — a super informative fertility education site that helped us source these numbers (this platform also costs money…nothing is free in this fertility world!).\n\n## IUI\n\nIUI, which stands for Intrauterine Insemination, is a procedure to put sperm directly inside the uterus, helping healthy sperm get closer to an egg. It is usually a “first try” for unexplained infertility. You may explore this if you have endometriosis or low sperm count/quality. It would also be used for same-sex female couples using donor sperm, or single women using donor sperm. It averages between $500-$4000 per cycle or “try,” essentially. The range is so wide because it can vary by medication pricing, monitoring and bloodwork, and the insemination procedure, so it mostly depends on the clinic you go to.\n\n## IVF\n\nIVF, which stands for In-Vitro Fertilization, is a procedure in which eggs and sperm are fertilized outside of the body in a test tube or petri dish, and then a viable fertilized embryo is put directly inside the uterus. It can be eggs and sperm from partners, or donor eggs / donor sperm. It is also often used with surrogates. This is often a next step in the unexplained infertility process, or for women who have fallopian tube damage/blockage, or other health concerns. IVF can cost well over $20,000 for one cycle when tallying the cost of treatment and medication–most women will average 2.1 cycles, bringing the total cost upwards of $40,000. Cost also depends on if you do genetic testing or other add-ons and is variable by clinic and by state.\n\n## Egg freezing\n\nEgg freezing is the last one we’ll cover, although there are many more fertility options. Egg freezing is a procedure in which eggs are extracted and then frozen using cryopreservation. It is used as a preservation measure, so that you can use the eggs later. You can freeze embryos (fertilized eggs) for preservation as well. On average, egg freezing patients will spend $30,000-$40,000 on treatment and storage. The breakdown is around $15,000 per cycle (to extract the eggs) and most women do an average of 2.1 cycles. Storage costs depend on location, but average around $500 per year.\n\nIt becomes even more complex when assessing the unit economics of fertility treatments. Freezing your eggs at 32 is a very different financial decision than freezing your eggs at 38, or 43 like Kourtney Kardashian. For example, you might be able to get 40 eggs in one round at age 32 for $20,000 with longer-term storage costs, and 20 eggs in three rounds at age 38 for $60,000 with reduced storage costs. We should be thinking not only about which fertility options might make sense for us, but also when those options make sense in the context of our wants and needs. It’s not fun to have to think about unit economics when thinking about the magic of having a baby! But that is exactly the kind of psychological barrier we hope to help women overcome.\n\n## So, what could I be thinking about?\n\nThere are a few companies popping up to make fertility procedures cheaper, which is exciting. That’s essentially [Kindbody’s](https://kindbody.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=kindbody&utm_term=kindbody&utm_campaign=__Kindbody+Brand&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=5349304425&hsa_cam=15158927904&hsa_grp=132895691881&hsa_ad=558827162131&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-482671827007&hsa_kw=kindbody&hsa_mt=p&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwspKUBhCvARIsAB2IYutVqaW_myuSzBGeZxOcosPqZGy-GuI_1dUAym-32IhnsXPZIIu6lHUaArX5EALw_wcB) premise–they’re improving user experience but also trying to drive down costs. But even at Kindbody, if you want to get a basic fertility assessment to find out where you’re at and if you should be worried, it can still be upwards of $300. In some states, insurance companies are required to cover a fertility assessment, so if you’re interested in getting a fertility workup done, talk to your OBGYN. They should be able to refer you to a clinic, and with that referral your insurance could cover it. But *always* ask upfront what your insurance will cover.\n\nThere are also companies like [Carrot Fertility](https://www.get-carrot.com/) or [Progyny](https://progyny.com/) that facilitate employers offering their employees fertility benefits. You could consider negotiating or advocating for fertility benefits in your current company or next job! And finally, there are companies like [Sunfish](https://joinsunfish.com/) offering financing and loans for fertility treatments.\n\nAdditionally, here are a few guiding questions you could ask yourself:\n\n“How do I feel about assisted reproductive technologies in general?”\n\n“Do I know what, if any, fertility coverage I currently have?”\n\n“If I have a partner(s), have we mutually discussed our feelings about ART? Does my partner have fertility benefits?”\n\n“I’m queer and would likely use ART to have a biological child with my partner, how might we plan for that?”\n\n“If I’m diagnosed with a fertility issue (about 10% of women have PCOS and 2–10% have endometriosis) and struggle to get pregnant naturally, how much money, if any, would I be willing to spend on assisted reproductive technology?”\n\n“Am I willing to start saving money (or advocating for benefits!) now to have a plan in place for if I might need ART?”\n\n## 4: Why We Might Not Want Kids\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/Why-We-Might-Not-Want-Kids-e1ilq28)\n\n## Let’s talk about this!\n\nObviously, it’s becoming increasingly socially acceptable to not want kids, but we don’t actually spend much structured time thinking or talking about the reasons why we do or do not want kids. We found in many cases in our interviews with women, it’s just referred to as a feeling. But where does this feeling come from? Is it subliminal social pressure? What your friends are doing? The next logical step in your relationship with your partner? Or, is it truly your own desire and intentional decision, one way or another?\n\nSo, let’s talk about why we might not want kids! Lack of a supportive partner, lifestyle and identity, climate change, and health concerns are all valid reasons for choosing not to have children and deserve some discussion to spark thoughtful reflection. And, even without children of your own, there are many ways to integrate children into your life if you still want to be around them.\n\n## Lack of supportive partner\n\nUnfortunately, the ever-present influence of traditional gender roles feeds into considerations around lack of a supportive partner. According to [happiness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness) expert Paul Dolan, a professor of behavioral science at the London School of Economics, women who are single with no children are actually the happiest. Dolan [explains](https://www.businessinsider.com/unmarried-childless-women-are-happiest-expert-says-2019-5) that while men derive benefits from [marriage](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/marriage), the same cannot generally be said for women. This statement is clearly very heteronormative and sweeping, and there are many really great marriages out there, but women are still typically the default for emotional and household labor within marriages, which gets exacerbated with children involved. Married heterosexual mothers notoriously take on more responsibilities than their male partners and very different responsibilities than their single women counterparts.\n\n## Lifestyle and identity\n\nHere, we want to touch on the concept of “regretting motherhood” which is super taboo in our society to talk about.\n\nSociologist Orna Donath published a book called [Regretting Motherhood,](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32302223-regretting-motherhood) which is a study on women who self-report regretting becoming mothers. There are many different reasons they became mothers in the first place–avoiding divorce, meeting family expectations, fitting in with friends, or simply because they thought it was the “next step”–and some of them actually did have a strong desire to be mothers before having kids, but all of them ended up regretting it when faced with the reality of motherhood.\n\nWe always hear about women who choose *not* to be mothers being warned that they will regret their decision later in life, but we really don’t talk about the possibility that the opposite could also be true — that a woman who becomes a mother might regret it. This brings us back to women dealing with most of the emotional and household labor in heterosexual relationships–the burden of childbearing often does fall primarily on the woman, which is a very real factor to consider depending on your relationship. Looking at the realities of the lifestyle changes and identity changes that come along with having kids, you might just decide you are not down for that shift and really value your autonomy, which is a completely valid choice.\n\n## Climate change\n\nClimate change is a very real consideration for a lot of folks in the decision of whether or not to have kids. In our parents’ generation, they still had plenty of societal issues going on that could make them wary of bringing children into the world (ex. war, economic stress, etc.), but it wasn’t at quite the same level of climate change–our world is fully on fire and not on track to stabilize.\n\nGiven the trajectory we’re on, there’s definitely questions of: “What kind of world am I bringing my kids into?” “Where should we live so that we’re not at constant threat of floods, fires, famine, etc., and can we even afford that?” For some, this feels more pressing than for others, but certainly we’re hearing more and more about people choosing not to have children due to climate change.\n\nWe are absolutely not trying to be doomsday here, and there’s an argument on the flip-side of all this where having children is actually a sign of sustained hope for the world, but we just want to validate the fact that you might have considered this and that you are not crazy for factoring climate into your decision-making.\n\n## Health concerns\n\nFinally, health concerns are a valid consideration. Maybe you are already dealing with a health condition that meaningfully affects your life and you do not know how a pregnancy or the stress of having children might impact your own personal health. We spoke with a woman who has a very intense autoimmune disease and is worried about taking care of a child while also trying to manage her disease. Obviously, our society should have better resources for and access to childcare, which would solve many of these problems, but within our current reality this is a serious consideration.\n\nEven the act of giving birth can come with serious health risks that are rarely talked about. [303,000](https://everymothercounts.org/our-story/the-issue/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwspKUBhCvARIsAB2IYuucoFuxdQwdJE4OyzDt4eGzFYrpU5MOFsJEDNZWagVR3FhDXp6sFzwaAhVzEALw_wcB) women die around the world as a result of complications of pregnancy and childbirth every year, and due to inequitable care, Black Women in the US have the highest [maternal mortality rate](https://usafacts.org/articles/the-us-maternal-mortality-rate-peaked-during-the-pandemic-and-was-highest-for-black-women/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=ND-Healthcare&gclid=Cj0KCQjwspKUBhCvARIsAB2IYutgrWUncb-QfJGc1JhdkS2mNZQbTxcO2t3O1wry1n1lTQJxH4B1d64aAp-VEALw_wcB), more than two times worse than that of any other racial or ethnic group.\n\nAdditionally, we are not told much about birthing until it happens to us. Even with more and more women opening up about the realities of childbirth on social media, we are still wildly uninformed when it comes to what happens to our bodies during and after childbirth. Even miscarriages are taboo, yet 10–20% of known pregnancies end in them. For some women, this might have a meaningful impact on whether or not they want to be a birthing parent and thus it should not remain a taboo topic.\n\n## What can I be thinking about?\n\nSo, there are a lot of reasons you might not want kids. We have a really strong narrative in society that parenthood will be the best thing that ever happened to you. However, we heard a quote recently that we loved along the lines of, “We are told parenthood will be the best thing that ever happened to you, but if you don’t become a parent or don’t want to,\\* something else \\*will be the best thing that ever happened to you.” You’ll always have a best thing! The best thing is not the same for everyone.\n\nThe status quo and cultural expectation is still to have children, but women are still sacrificing the most with having kids. So we hope that the decision of whether or not to have kids becomes more intentional– one you truly have conviction in. Also, experiencing the positive impacts of “nurturing” something does not have to be children. It could be nurturing your relationships, your community, the world in whatever way feels right to you. Or, if you are really inclined to nurture children, there are a million ways to integrate kids into your life even if they are not your own.\n\nHere are some guiding questions to consider:\n\n“Have I thought about all the ways my lifestyle would change if I were to have kids? Am I okay with that? “\n\n“Do I want kids of my own or just kids in my life in general?”\n\n“Do I feel like I would be taking on the role of primary caregiver in my relationship if we were to have kids, and if so, am I okay with that?”\n\n“Do I feel that bringing a child into the world is something I’m comfortable with given my own personal feelings about the trajectory our world is on?”\n\n“Does having the right partner meaningfully impact whether or not I would want kids?”\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nUltimately, the goal of this article is to help women avoid the “Oh Sh\\*t” moment we keep hearing about, where they get totally blindsided by fertility challenges. And again, you can have babies at any age and in a lot of different ways–we just want everyone to understand the options that are available to them and empower everyone to become their own advocate!\n\n## Please reach out if this brought anything up for you or if you have any questions!", "timestamp": 1653251852, "digest": "_DoeT7tVEMYnXe0R3156V0S9AKYoJb3xdw_cSY4SAVE", "contributor": "0xa0C3a5E5e25dDE1148296d8c3971e17009b45ccF"}

Have you heard about IVF or surrogacy and thought, “I should probably actually understand what that entails,” but never followed up? Do you get a little pit in your stomach when someone mentions egg freezing and think, “should I be looking into that?”\n\nIf any of these ring true for you, no worries, we are totally with you. It is completely normal to put off thinking about this stuff when it doesn’t feel particularly relevant or pressing! That said, we focused our [graduate thesis](https://soeithelp.stanford.edu/design-impact) research on enabling women to make informed decisions about their fertility and family planning. In interviewing dozens of women ages 21–40 over the past year, we’ve started to realize that pushing off thinking about this stuff is leading to what we now call “Oh Sh\\*t” moments down the road, when suddenly options for having kids can feel a lot more limited and women ask themselves “when was I supposed to be planning for this?”\n\nAt the same time, women we interviewed who were not yet thinking about children reported feeling like they *should* be and asked us to share back with them what we found. There seems to be a general sense of “I should know more,” but not a lot of guidance on what to learn.\n\nSo, that said, we’re here to share a few things we’ve learned with you throughout our research so that we can all start clarifying our desires and understanding our options before we hit any sort of panic zone around fertility. This is in no way pushing anyone to have children, or to set hard-and-fast timelines, but just to help us all start having realistic conversations with ourselves around how our lives could play out, with a few guiding questions along the way.\n\n## 1: The Disney Princess Complex and Preventing the “Oh Sh\\*t” Moment\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/The-Oh-Sht-Moment-e1ilpti)\n\n## What is the “Disney princess” complex?\n\nWe’ll preface by pointing out that we didn’t come up with this term. It has been a headline before, but different groups have defined it in different ways. Some describe it as causing body image issues and an obsession with looks. Others (mostly male blogs) say it causes unrealistic expectations in dating. What *we* are calling the disney princess complex is the idea that we are socialized to believe once we fall in love, everything will fall into place in our lives and we’ll live happily ever after — a whimsical approach to dating and potential family-building.\n\nOver the past few decades we’ve actually come a pretty long way in moving away from this narrative in how we think about relationships, since it’s obviously becoming more and more normal to be independent and career-focused and not just wait around for a man to save us. And beyond that, it’s way more accepted to be queer, not get married, or have different relationship structures like polyamory or open relationships.\n\nBut while narratives around what it means to be a woman in the world have shifted, our narratives around children have not. We’re still conditioned to believe that if we have a partner who loves us, kids will just work out when the time is right, like we see in fairytales. Or beyond fairytales, what we’ve seen with the generations before us. But as the “right time” for kids gets pushed due to later marriages, career aspirations, and financial constraints, for a lot of people it has become an experience far from a fairytale. The Disney princess influence on family “just working out” does not match our current reality, and provides a pretty unrealistic narrative of what to expect. We are not Disney princesses, nor do we want to be! But until we reconcile the disconnect and start planning within our current reality, “Oh Sh\\*t” moments will continue to happen.\n\n## What is causing these “Oh Sh\\*t” moments and how can we prevent them?\n\n## Need for reproductive assistance\n\nOne [statistic](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/02news/ameriwomen.htm) to note is that the average age at which women had their first child in the US rose from 21.4 years old in 1970 to 26.9 in 2018. For fathers, it’s increased from 27 to 31. Obviously, this still sounds pretty young. I mean, we’re in our mid-twenties, but this age thing feeds into the fact that one in six couples today has trouble conceiving. And, in at least half of all cases of infertility, a [male factor](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17201-male-infertility) is a major or contributing cause. So, often, the “Oh Sh\\*t” moment in a heterosexual relationship could be getting to the point of being ready to have kids and then realizing you’re going to need some assistance if you want to have biological children–for queer couples this could be finding out how much it costs to utilize assisted reproductive technologies (ART) or realizing that you are not covered by insurance.\n\nAuthor’s note: we believe everyone should have access to fertility benefits! And abortion! True agency is the ability to say no and to say yes (check out our website [http://whohateswomen.com](http://whohateswomen.com/) for more on this).\n\n## Shift in life circumstances\n\nAnother reason for the “Oh Sh\\*t” moment comes from life changes; we’ve heard from a lot of women in their 30’s or 40’s who went through breakups or encountered other life changes and suddenly their life circumstances around children were completely different. They’d been assuming things were going to work out when the time was right, and planning for a certain version of their life, but all of a sudden they’re asking themselves questions like, am I willing to have kids on my own? Should I have frozen my eggs years ago? How important are biological children to me?\n\n## Medical diagnoses\n\nAnd finally, “Oh Sh\\*t” moments can come along with medical diagnoses. We have a really long way to go in the world of women’s healthcare to even understand what is going on with our bodies (we could do a whole separate book on that), but we’ve talked to a bunch of women who face an “Oh Sh\\*t” moment when they suddenly become aware of a medical condition, like endometriosis, PCOS, or an autoimmune disease that could affect their fertility and need to make decisions about how to handle that. This can also come about at the moment of transition for transgender folks in deciding how to handle preserving fertility if they’d like to do so.\n\n## What do I do with this information?\n\nRight, so honestly, that’s kind of the whole point of this article! We know this stuff can be super overwhelming, and it’s way easier to just be like “I’ll deal with this later”. But we’ve heard from enough women now who kept moving the goalpost of “I’ll deal with this later,” and ultimately ended up in very stressful scenarios, that we really think there is value in starting to think about this stuff earlier on.\n\nFor a lot of people, this is honestly just getting clear with yourself on some possible scenarios for how your life could play out and thinking through what you might do in that situation. Here are some examples:\n\n“I know I *really* want kids, so if I get to be in my early 30’s and I’m still really not feeling ready, maybe that’s when I get a fertility assessment to see if anything is abnormal that I should be aware of?”\n\n“I’m not sure if I want kids yet, but if I decide to have them it would likely be in my late 30’s or even early 40’s, thus IVF could be necessary. Maybe I could consider freezing my eggs at a younger age in order for that to have a higher chance of success?”\n\n“I’m queer and know I will want to use assited reproductive technologies to have children, but all of that can cost a lot of money. Maybe I could start saving or advocating for fertility benefits in my workplace?”\n\nAgain, none of this is personal or medical advice at all, but we think knowledge is power. If we can get educated on the options out there, understand the realistic costs and limitations that might exist, and reflect on how these options might fit into our own lives, then we have a lot more agency over our futures. We can avoid the “Oh Sh\\*t” moments, not miss out on options because we didn’t know or didn’t understand, and feel convicted in our decisions when it is time to make them.\n\n## 2: The Paradox of Partnership\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/The-Paradox-of-Partnership-e1ilpvg)\n\n## What is the “Paradox of Partnership?”\n\nWhen chatting with dozens of women between the ages of 21 and 40, partnership and lack of partnership are both used as reasons to delay thinking about family planning and fertility. We heard people in partnerships say “I’m not too worried about it, we’ll have these conversations once we get more serious about having kids” and people without partners say “I don’t have a partner so I don’t think about family planning yet.” Sound like you?\n\n## So, when are people planning for children?\n\nIn many cases, right before they start trying! Which, in our parents’ generation, made a bit more sense because marriage and children were essentially the default for everyone and timelines tended to move more quickly. Now, couples are waiting a lot longer not only to marry, but also to have kids. Many factors contribute to this, but according to [a study](https://modernfertility.com/modern-state-fertility-2020-sofi-career-money) by Sofi and Modern Fertility, 60% of respondents reported delaying childbearing due to not having enough money. Life costs more money nowadays, so getting to a place where we can fully provide for children is taking longer than for our parents, and we have pretty abysmal childcare support in this country to help us.\n\nOn top of that, there are higher numbers of women pursuing education and continued education, and more women working and advancing in their careers. Relationships and dating have changed, as well–in some ways it feels like we’re all slight commitment-phobes due to the rise of divorce rates we experienced with our parents’ generation.\n\nSo, all of this combined is pushing out the timeline for having kids. Which in some sense is awesome. It provides more opportunity to pursue other things outside of building a family. The only problem is that our ability to have biological children really does change over time. We can push out the timeline, but if the goalpost keeps moving back and back and back, eventually we could run into a situation where we just don’t have as many options as we did before. Most folks we’ve interviewed have pretty vague ideas of what it might look like to try to have kids at different stages of life given egg counts, fertility challenges, etc.\n\nHence, the need to plan ahead. We believe more forethought could go into what you want, outside of partnership. When you consider divorce rates averaging around 45–50%, the likelihood of raising children on your own or co-parenting from different households is actually quite high. This is not a fun statistic, but it was a reframe that helped us think through the realities of choosing to have children.\n\nWe also heard many stories of women experiencing a breakup at 35, 36, 37 with someone they thought they were going to marry and have kids with. That can’t be planned for, of course, but it’s a very real possibility–partnership is kind of a question mark! Doesn’t it feel a bit odd to hinge such a big decision on a question mark?\n\n## Yes! What do I do with this information?\n\nWe plan out almost everything else in our lives, so it’s interesting that we keep this sort of whimsical outlook of “it will fall into place!” Or “if it’s meant to be it will be” around having kids. We believe this is a conversation that is useful to have with ourselves, outside of partnership, so that we can handle possible changes in our lives with the grounding that we know what we want.\n\nWe’ve laid out some examples of guiding questions to think about with yourself, whether or not you have a partner:\n\n“I don’t have a partner at this moment and I’m like 75% sure I want kids in the future, but definitely not 100%…would I be willing to spend money on getting a fertility assessment or freezing my eggs now so that I can have some extra buffer room to decide?”\n\n“I definitely need to be on the same page about kids as my partner before marriage, but when I brought it up it kind of caught them off-guard. What do I really want kid-wise and what kind of timeline am I thinking about? What will I do if we don’t align?”\n\n“Thinking about future partners — I’d want to ask myself if I would feel confident raising a child with them if we did not stay together romantically in the future?”\n\n“What if I’m not even sure I want the 1:1 partnership model for the rest of my life? Would I consider having kids on my own? Would I want to be a “choice mom” (the new term for having children solo intentionally)?\n\n“Do I want multiple partners or a larger family unit to raise children with as a community?”\n\nNow, this is not to scare anyone or push folks to overplan. These are huge questions, and our answers can change over time. But knowing our options, being real about the various outcomes that could play out, and having a good sense of our own desires–detached from partnership–should set us up to have much more agency than if we put off thinking about children until we want to start trying.\n\n## 3: False Confidence in Options and Fertility Unit Economics\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/False-Optionality-e1ilq0l)\n\n## What is causing “false confidence” in fertility?\n\nWith rapid advancements in fertility technology and heavy investment in the space, it’s easy to believe that we will have plenty of options for conceiving when the time is right. There are some really exciting emerging technologies. However, due to high cost and mixed success rates of fertility interventions, our current options are actually less of a slam dunk than we think, and can lead to emotional and physical challenges.\n\nWe also seem to have a skewed understanding of the accessibility of these fertility interventions, partly from the influence of celebrity news and social media. In 2015, Gabrielle Union opened up about the shame she felt in prioritizing career over family building, leading her to pursue IVF in her 40’s. In 2016, Selena Gomez froze her eggs; her medical care team recommended considering the procedure before undergoing chemotherapy for Lupus. In 2018, Halsey froze her eggs at 23 due to her endometriosis diagnosis and related surgeries. In 2020, we learned more about Kim Kardashian’s fertility journey–during her first two pregnancies she experienced placenta accreta and gestational diabetes, a condition in which the placenta gets stuck inside the body during birth. Because of this, she chose to use surrogates for her third and fourth children. In 2021, we watched Heather Rae from Selling Sunsets document her fertility journey through IVF and embryo preservation on TikTok. And finally, in 2022, we learned Chrissy Teigen is using IVF to try for her third child and saw her share the all-too-common, but often private, pain of miscarriage.\n\nOn the one hand, this exposure is great. It’s passively trojan-horsing some of this fertility information to folks and normalizing conversations. But while exposure is good, it could also be giving us a false sense of security. We hear the ages of some of these celebrities and think “ah, I have all the time in the world.” However, for them, money isn’t an issue. They can afford as many cycles or procedures as it takes, and can seek out and travel to the best clinics in the world.\n\nWe also detected a lot of false confidence when speaking with women who use their mom’s story as an example of success. We heard things like, “well my mom had a kid at 39, so I’m probably good!” However, there are differences between our mothers’ generation and ours. Not only are we, on average, having kids later in life, there’s also more and more [evidence ](https://www.popsci.com/air-pollution-fertility-pregnancy/)that environmental factors like pollution affect fertility, and that fertility is generally on the decline.\n\nFertility struggles also are not limited to women. In fact, it’s a giant misconception and one that we need to set straight. In at least half of all cases of infertility, a male factor is a [major or contributing cause](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17201-male-infertility). While researchers aren’t sure what exactly is causing male-factor infertility–they mostly blame environmental factors–it is clear that male fertility is decreasing. In 1992, a [study](https://www.bmj.com/content/305/6854/609) found a global 50% decline in sperm counts in men over the previous 60 years. Multiple studies over subsequent years confirmed that initial finding, including a 2017 [paper](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/6/646/4035689) showing 50–60% decline in sperm concentration between 1973 and 2011 in men from around the world.\n\nSo what does this mean? We’re not trying to scare the shit out of everyone. But there’s no denying fertility is changing and the need for assisted reproductive technologies is increasing. We need to get real about how much different treatments cost and the likely success rates at different ages (because age matters here too) with assisted reproductive technologies like IUI, egg freezing, and IVF. With this information we can better plan, better save, and better prioritize when making life decisions, like potentially taking fertility benefits into account when job searching.\n\n## How much do fertility options really cost?\n\nTo begin, we need to make clear that most of these procedures are not covered by insurance, public or private. This is something not everyone knows. Unless it is deemed “medically necessary,” like in the case of women undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, it is not covered. And these guidelines are quite strict–we spoke with a woman undergoing chemo for an autoimmune disease who could not get egg freezing covered as “medically necessary” because it wasn’t cancer. This also typically excludes LGBTQ+ individuals who don’t meet the definitions of “infertility” that may qualify them for coverage. Even transgender individuals undergoing gender-affirming care may not meet the criteria for “infertility” that would cover them for fertility preservation (think: egg or sperm freezing).\n\nSo, most patients are paying out of pocket for these treatments, which can end up being well over $10,000, depending on the treatment. Let’s break it down. And shoutout to [FertilityIQ](https://www.fertilityiq.com/) — a super informative fertility education site that helped us source these numbers (this platform also costs money…nothing is free in this fertility world!).\n\n## IUI\n\nIUI, which stands for Intrauterine Insemination, is a procedure to put sperm directly inside the uterus, helping healthy sperm get closer to an egg. It is usually a “first try” for unexplained infertility. You may explore this if you have endometriosis or low sperm count/quality. It would also be used for same-sex female couples using donor sperm, or single women using donor sperm. It averages between $500-$4000 per cycle or “try,” essentially. The range is so wide because it can vary by medication pricing, monitoring and bloodwork, and the insemination procedure, so it mostly depends on the clinic you go to.\n\n## IVF\n\nIVF, which stands for In-Vitro Fertilization, is a procedure in which eggs and sperm are fertilized outside of the body in a test tube or petri dish, and then a viable fertilized embryo is put directly inside the uterus. It can be eggs and sperm from partners, or donor eggs / donor sperm. It is also often used with surrogates. This is often a next step in the unexplained infertility process, or for women who have fallopian tube damage/blockage, or other health concerns. IVF can cost well over $20,000 for one cycle when tallying the cost of treatment and medication–most women will average 2.1 cycles, bringing the total cost upwards of $40,000. Cost also depends on if you do genetic testing or other add-ons and is variable by clinic and by state.\n\n## Egg freezing\n\nEgg freezing is the last one we’ll cover, although there are many more fertility options. Egg freezing is a procedure in which eggs are extracted and then frozen using cryopreservation. It is used as a preservation measure, so that you can use the eggs later. You can freeze embryos (fertilized eggs) for preservation as well. On average, egg freezing patients will spend $30,000-$40,000 on treatment and storage. The breakdown is around $15,000 per cycle (to extract the eggs) and most women do an average of 2.1 cycles. Storage costs depend on location, but average around $500 per year.\n\nIt becomes even more complex when assessing the unit economics of fertility treatments. Freezing your eggs at 32 is a very different financial decision than freezing your eggs at 38, or 43 like Kourtney Kardashian. For example, you might be able to get 40 eggs in one round at age 32 for $20,000 with longer-term storage costs, and 20 eggs in three rounds at age 38 for $60,000 with reduced storage costs. We should be thinking not only about which fertility options might make sense for us, but also when those options make sense in the context of our wants and needs. It’s not fun to have to think about unit economics when thinking about the magic of having a baby! But that is exactly the kind of psychological barrier we hope to help women overcome.\n\n## So, what could I be thinking about?\n\nThere are a few companies popping up to make fertility procedures cheaper, which is exciting. That’s essentially [Kindbody’s](https://kindbody.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=kindbody&utm_term=kindbody&utm_campaign=__Kindbody+Brand&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=5349304425&hsa_cam=15158927904&hsa_grp=132895691881&hsa_ad=558827162131&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-482671827007&hsa_kw=kindbody&hsa_mt=p&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwspKUBhCvARIsAB2IYutVqaW_myuSzBGeZxOcosPqZGy-GuI_1dUAym-32IhnsXPZIIu6lHUaArX5EALw_wcB) premise–they’re improving user experience but also trying to drive down costs. But even at Kindbody, if you want to get a basic fertility assessment to find out where you’re at and if you should be worried, it can still be upwards of $300. In some states, insurance companies are required to cover a fertility assessment, so if you’re interested in getting a fertility workup done, talk to your OBGYN. They should be able to refer you to a clinic, and with that referral your insurance could cover it. But *always* ask upfront what your insurance will cover.\n\nThere are also companies like [Carrot Fertility](https://www.get-carrot.com/) or [Progyny](https://progyny.com/) that facilitate employers offering their employees fertility benefits. You could consider negotiating or advocating for fertility benefits in your current company or next job! And finally, there are companies like [Sunfish](https://joinsunfish.com/) offering financing and loans for fertility treatments.\n\nAdditionally, here are a few guiding questions you could ask yourself:\n\n“How do I feel about assisted reproductive technologies in general?”\n\n“Do I know what, if any, fertility coverage I currently have?”\n\n“If I have a partner(s), have we mutually discussed our feelings about ART? Does my partner have fertility benefits?”\n\n“I’m queer and would likely use ART to have a biological child with my partner, how might we plan for that?”\n\n“If I’m diagnosed with a fertility issue (about 10% of women have PCOS and 2–10% have endometriosis) and struggle to get pregnant naturally, how much money, if any, would I be willing to spend on assisted reproductive technology?”\n\n“Am I willing to start saving money (or advocating for benefits!) now to have a plan in place for if I might need ART?”\n\n## 4: Why We Might Not Want Kids\n\n🔊[Listen as a podcast here](https://anchor.fm/thefwordfertility/episodes/Why-We-Might-Not-Want-Kids-e1ilq28)\n\n## Let’s talk about this!\n\nObviously, it’s becoming increasingly socially acceptable to not want kids, but we don’t actually spend much structured time thinking or talking about the reasons why we do or do not want kids. We found in many cases in our interviews with women, it’s just referred to as a feeling. But where does this feeling come from? Is it subliminal social pressure? What your friends are doing? The next logical step in your relationship with your partner? Or, is it truly your own desire and intentional decision, one way or another?\n\nSo, let’s talk about why we might not want kids! Lack of a supportive partner, lifestyle and identity, climate change, and health concerns are all valid reasons for choosing not to have children and deserve some discussion to spark thoughtful reflection. And, even without children of your own, there are many ways to integrate children into your life if you still want to be around them.\n\n## Lack of supportive partner\n\nUnfortunately, the ever-present influence of traditional gender roles feeds into considerations around lack of a supportive partner. According to [happiness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness) expert Paul Dolan, a professor of behavioral science at the London School of Economics, women who are single with no children are actually the happiest. Dolan [explains](https://www.businessinsider.com/unmarried-childless-women-are-happiest-expert-says-2019-5) that while men derive benefits from [marriage](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/marriage), the same cannot generally be said for women. This statement is clearly very heteronormative and sweeping, and there are many really great marriages out there, but women are still typically the default for emotional and household labor within marriages, which gets exacerbated with children involved. Married heterosexual mothers notoriously take on more responsibilities than their male partners and very different responsibilities than their single women counterparts.\n\n## Lifestyle and identity\n\nHere, we want to touch on the concept of “regretting motherhood” which is super taboo in our society to talk about.\n\nSociologist Orna Donath published a book called [Regretting Motherhood,](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32302223-regretting-motherhood) which is a study on women who self-report regretting becoming mothers. There are many different reasons they became mothers in the first place–avoiding divorce, meeting family expectations, fitting in with friends, or simply because they thought it was the “next step”–and some of them actually did have a strong desire to be mothers before having kids, but all of them ended up regretting it when faced with the reality of motherhood.\n\nWe always hear about women who choose *not* to be mothers being warned that they will regret their decision later in life, but we really don’t talk about the possibility that the opposite could also be true — that a woman who becomes a mother might regret it. This brings us back to women dealing with most of the emotional and household labor in heterosexual relationships–the burden of childbearing often does fall primarily on the woman, which is a very real factor to consider depending on your relationship. Looking at the realities of the lifestyle changes and identity changes that come along with having kids, you might just decide you are not down for that shift and really value your autonomy, which is a completely valid choice.\n\n## Climate change\n\nClimate change is a very real consideration for a lot of folks in the decision of whether or not to have kids. In our parents’ generation, they still had plenty of societal issues going on that could make them wary of bringing children into the world (ex. war, economic stress, etc.), but it wasn’t at quite the same level of climate change–our world is fully on fire and not on track to stabilize.\n\nGiven the trajectory we’re on, there’s definitely questions of: “What kind of world am I bringing my kids into?” “Where should we live so that we’re not at constant threat of floods, fires, famine, etc., and can we even afford that?” For some, this feels more pressing than for others, but certainly we’re hearing more and more about people choosing not to have children due to climate change.\n\nWe are absolutely not trying to be doomsday here, and there’s an argument on the flip-side of all this where having children is actually a sign of sustained hope for the world, but we just want to validate the fact that you might have considered this and that you are not crazy for factoring climate into your decision-making.\n\n## Health concerns\n\nFinally, health concerns are a valid consideration. Maybe you are already dealing with a health condition that meaningfully affects your life and you do not know how a pregnancy or the stress of having children might impact your own personal health. We spoke with a woman who has a very intense autoimmune disease and is worried about taking care of a child while also trying to manage her disease. Obviously, our society should have better resources for and access to childcare, which would solve many of these problems, but within our current reality this is a serious consideration.\n\nEven the act of giving birth can come with serious health risks that are rarely talked about. [303,000](https://everymothercounts.org/our-story/the-issue/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwspKUBhCvARIsAB2IYuucoFuxdQwdJE4OyzDt4eGzFYrpU5MOFsJEDNZWagVR3FhDXp6sFzwaAhVzEALw_wcB) women die around the world as a result of complications of pregnancy and childbirth every year, and due to inequitable care, Black Women in the US have the highest [maternal mortality rate](https://usafacts.org/articles/the-us-maternal-mortality-rate-peaked-during-the-pandemic-and-was-highest-for-black-women/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=ND-Healthcare&gclid=Cj0KCQjwspKUBhCvARIsAB2IYutgrWUncb-QfJGc1JhdkS2mNZQbTxcO2t3O1wry1n1lTQJxH4B1d64aAp-VEALw_wcB), more than two times worse than that of any other racial or ethnic group.\n\nAdditionally, we are not told much about birthing until it happens to us. Even with more and more women opening up about the realities of childbirth on social media, we are still wildly uninformed when it comes to what happens to our bodies during and after childbirth. Even miscarriages are taboo, yet 10–20% of known pregnancies end in them. For some women, this might have a meaningful impact on whether or not they want to be a birthing parent and thus it should not remain a taboo topic.\n\n## What can I be thinking about?\n\nSo, there are a lot of reasons you might not want kids. We have a really strong narrative in society that parenthood will be the best thing that ever happened to you. However, we heard a quote recently that we loved along the lines of, “We are told parenthood will be the best thing that ever happened to you, but if you don’t become a parent or don’t want to,\\* something else \\*will be the best thing that ever happened to you.” You’ll always have a best thing! The best thing is not the same for everyone.\n\nThe status quo and cultural expectation is still to have children, but women are still sacrificing the most with having kids. So we hope that the decision of whether or not to have kids becomes more intentional– one you truly have conviction in. Also, experiencing the positive impacts of “nurturing” something does not have to be children. It could be nurturing your relationships, your community, the world in whatever way feels right to you. Or, if you are really inclined to nurture children, there are a million ways to integrate kids into your life even if they are not your own.\n\nHere are some guiding questions to consider:\n\n“Have I thought about all the ways my lifestyle would change if I were to have kids? Am I okay with that? “\n\n“Do I want kids of my own or just kids in my life in general?”\n\n“Do I feel like I would be taking on the role of primary caregiver in my relationship if we were to have kids, and if so, am I okay with that?”\n\n“Do I feel that bringing a child into the world is something I’m comfortable with given my own personal feelings about the trajectory our world is on?”\n\n“Does having the right partner meaningfully impact whether or not I would want kids?”\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nUltimately, the goal of this article is to help women avoid the “Oh Sh\\*t” moment we keep hearing about, where they get totally blindsided by fertility challenges.

American media began to black James", "body": "Did James really dominate the deal\n\nOn February 6 Beijing time, the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Indiana Pacers 94-136 away. It is worth mentioning that the Lakers were 23 points behind the Pacers at the end of the half-time. In the game, when Ingram made a free throw, the fans were shouting at him: LeBron is going to trade you.\n\nAt the end of the half-time, the US media spoofed James and sent a text message to the magician: “trade Anthony Davis quickly, or I will continue to sit on the bench in the second half.” At present, the Lakers are in the vortex of public opinion in the transaction. In such a transaction, the team’s hearts are naturally scattered. More importantly, almost everyone of these young players has been sent to the shelves by the management.\n\nIn the latest development of today’s transaction, the Lakers gave the final offer: Ball brother + Kuzma + Ingram + Hart + zubartz + pop + two first round signings for Anthony Davis and Solomon hill. At that time, when looking at the offer, Chumei had praised it, but then the offer was rejected by the pelican, and the Lakers withdrew all transactions about Chumei.\n\nAnd every offer from the Lakers, Ingram and Kuzma are listed. No wonder the fans will react like this today! In this battle, Ingram got 12 points and 6 rebounds. （Emily）", "timestamp": 1653252533, "digest": "LAvX7Qz2iURoEc4Zg6EbJ5vs54Pf9mCNNJUbfivLO-s", "contributor": "0x4e5A16d837674fD858686D895Ce0a6ED3988FD2f"}

The announcement also said that a few days earlier, Shuangliang energy conservation also signed orders for crystalline silicon reduction furnace of more than 324 million yuan.\n\nAccording to the announcement released by Shuangliang energy conservation on the 9th, Dongfang Risheng expects to purchase 1.572 billion monocrystalline silicon chips from the wholly-owned subsidiary of Shuangliang energy conservation from 2022 to 2024.\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, Shuangliang energy conservation entered the silicon wafer market. Since this year, the company has deepened the layout of photovoltaic field, promoted the differentiated development of photovoltaic business, and realized strategic coordination with the industrial chain. While opening up orders, Shuangliang’s energy-saving industry gradually became clear, forming two “carbon neutral” related sectors of “energy conservation and water saving” and “new energy”.\n\nShuangliang energy conservation said that since the company started the silicon wafer business, it has signed long silicon material purchase orders with Xinte, ASI, Jiangsu Zhongneng and other enterprises, and the silicon material supply has always been stable. In addition to solid orders on hand, the technical advantages and continuous iteration of the silicon wafer business also continue to ensure the market development ability of the business. So far, Shuangliang energy conservation has signed a long silicon wafer / silicon rod order, with an amount of about 77.9 billion yuan.\n\nAccording to the announcement on the 9th, the subject of another single contract signed by Shuangliang energy conservation is a multi pair rod polysilicon reduction furnace, with a contract amount of 324 million yuan. In the field of reduction furnace, Shuangliang energy-saving ploughing takes longer. Shuangliang energy saving was founded in 1982. After going public in 2003, it began to layout photovoltaic business and provide polysilicon reduction furnace for downstream silicon wafer manufacturers. In 2022, the amount of newly signed orders for polysilicon reduction furnace has reached 1.886 billion yuan.\n\nIt is understood that Shuangliang energy conservation also continues to promote upstream and downstream cooperation in the industrial chain, forming an industrial layout from “series” to “parallel” with reduction furnace customers, silicon wafer customers and component customers.\n\nToday, the photovoltaic business has brought strong performance growth to Shuangliang energy conservation. In the first quarter of this year, Shuangliang energy conservation achieved an operating revenue of 1.734 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 299.5%.\n\nThe relevant person in charge of Shuangliang energy conservation said that with rich industry experience and close customer relationship, the company will build a new growth pole, so as to accelerate the strategic layout from professional equipment manufacturers to zero carbon green energy solution providers.", "timestamp": 1653252720, "digest": "oTeE_kgvkjhjNdrAnXgfAXSTHOG4fGNFfpn4FTe-g7Q", "contributor": "0x0d85Db479c9A5249ac9d78ad2BaF52C07788392C"}

One must say that the world's best workspace is not possible without the world's best people like them, and while the void is deep, they left a Polaris to look up to.\n\nUnless you’re secretly a billionaire — or Elon Musk — you probably want to work at your dream job one day (read: every day).\n\nThere are a few challenges with doing that.\n\n1. You’ll have to figure out *what* your dream job is, which is a little more challenging than it sounds.\n2. When you’ve figured out your dream job — and you might’ve guessed this — finding that place and getting hired for the role you want is a *LOT* more challenging than it sounds.\n\nI’ve always known that I didn’t have it in me to work a toxic full-time \\*\\*\\*\\*job.\n\nI also know that those sorts of jobs permeate Nigeria’s job market, giving workers fewer good options than they deserve.\n\nBeing able to pick the sort of jobs I work at is a privilege I am forever grateful for; most of my working life has been with amazing companies and organizations with kind, caring coworkers.\n\nGood for me, right?

Big tech companies control the platforms and tools we use every day — from Google’s search engine to Meta’s suite of social apps to the app you’re reading this article on.\n\nThey own the platforms. They make the rules.\n\nThis contrasts starkly with “Web3,” which uses [peer-to-peer technology](https://ntkris.substack.com/p/what-can-web3-solve-for-users?s=r) to let people access anything on the internet without giving up power to one person.\n\nThe next thing you want to know about is the meaning of “DAO.” A DAO is a community of people working on Web3 who prefer to be autonomous.\n\nThey don’t like big tech owning all the most used internet software, and they don’t want to follow rules that may not be in their best interests as users.\n\n“DAO” is an acronym for Decentralised Autonomous Organisation:\n\n* “Decentralised” = “There isn’t one person in charge. Everyone can be in charge.”\n* “Autonomous” = “We make our own rules.”\n* The word organization shares that it’s not a company but a group of people aligned to one goal.\n\nThere are hundreds of DAOs, and each one is creating projects that help you do anything from save the environment to travel luxuriously.\n\nHere’s the last thing you should know.\n\n“Regen,” aka regenerative\\*,\\* means a lot of things. Their sum is “**practices that use Web3 to improve the world for *everyone’s* benefit**.”\n\nTherefore, a Regen DAO is a decentralized, autonomous organization that uses Web3 to improve the world for everyone’s benefit.\n\nI mentioned earlier that, on Web2, the people who own the platform make the rules. That can be a bad thing, and here’s an example from my life.\n\nIn early 2020, I applied to volunteer with a large org working on a cause I care deeply about.\n\nMy role was at the grassroots level — I would interact directly with the kids we were helping through the organization’s key program, report to directors in my region (community leaders I looked up to), and help reach more young participants.\n\nI was stoked.\n\n… for all of two weeks.\n\nBarely a fortnight after I joined, the org was draining me. I got near midnight calls and messages from program participants (I didn’t sign up for these, but someone needed to take them) and was pressured into working as late as 3 am on tasks assigned to my team.\n\nI was burning out.\n\nFast.\n\nOn top of all this, I had life and online school to think about, but the org didn’t have a system to let me reduce my hours or share my needs, and my only other teammate was even more burnt out than I was.\n\nThe most stressful part of the endeavor — and the one that made me quit first thing in the morning after a crying, screaming breakdown at 2 a.m. in my mother’s dining room — was that the deadlines were unachievable for anyone but [Kyle XY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_XY).\n\nI had come into the org wanting to use excellent marketing to further the cause but rarely had time to think of my personal social content goals, much less post anything for them.\n\nOur manager was toxic. They beat volunteers down verbally and then gaslit workers into thinking of the verbal abuse as “constructive feedback.” This manager’s superior communicated with and deferred to them in all things, so volunteers had no one to turn to.\n\nI quit. Obviously.\n\nBut that situation could have been so much better. You’ll find the key problems from that story in almost every company at various levels of solved-ness. Let’s call them **the Workplace Ruinators**.\n\nI haven’t encountered a regen DAO with this problem because most DAO models work using “contributors” instead of “hires.”\n\nA contributor has more role flexibility than a hire ever can from the get-go. In most cases, you can look at what a DAO is doing and contribute if it appeals to you.\n\nThen you choose *how* you want to contribute. The DAO may pay you per project, with a salary, a stipend, or a mix of each, depending on how it operates.\n\nWhat happens if you change your mind about how you want to contribute?\n\nYou switch it up. Contributors tackle a problem or provide a needed service within a DAO: You’re golden as long as you can help.\n\n***Workplace Ruin averted.***\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1192/1\\*ZksPAFlrW25Uw7w5Cgqfdw.jpeg)\n\nNot every regen DAO operates with contributors alone. But when they do, you’re asking for a specific role in a project you’re genuinely psyched about, so you don’t have to deal with aspects of the job that make you go “eek.”\n\nIn regen DAOs, work is not assigned. You ask for it or are invited. (Invited here is *an actual invite*. None of that passive-aggressive, “We’re pretending you have a choice” stuff.)\n\nAnd, if you’re on a project where you like *some* of the work — but not all of it — there’s almost always going to be a contributor eager to help by doing the thing you dislike.\n\nAll DAOs promote a fast, collaborative, “make it happen” culture. Picture yourself in that environment: a contract or full-time worker doing work you don’t like or cannot excel at.\n\nRegen DAO leaders and other collaborators are glad (read: completely understanding and *happy)* to take such work off your hands.\n\nHow does this situation play out in a Regen DAO?\n\n**On having fun at work:** Web3 is meme culture at its best. Regen web3 is even better: Everyone appreciates the value of a workplace where all contributors feel valued, accepted, and heard. And, like GitcoinDAOs [Memeapalooza](https://twitter.com/GitcoinDAO/status/1499827748117913604?t=g2L1tjf7QW-smrFldJ31_Q&s=19) event, everyone *has fun*.\n\n**On communicating with managers and sharing ideas without anxiety:** DAO contributors in leadership are paradigms of this culture; using a “Yes, and” mentality when faced with new ideas, facilitating collaboration, and ensuring everyone is aware of the resources available to them. DreamDAO co-founder Gary Sheng is a great example:\n\nGary’s reflections while learning in public.\n\nLeaders like Sean Mannis of Gitcoin’s MMM (Merch, Memes, and Marketing) workstream push for workplace innovation that makes it easy to get constructive feedback and recognition from your peers and do work that fits in your life.\n\nSounds fantastic.\n\n**On inclusion and diversity**\n\nI can’t 100% say that every Regen DAO does its best to make a workplace that is openly inclusive. However, they *do* create environments that scorn prejudice and marginalization. They also create environments where anyone feels encouraged to propose a project changing things that may make people feel unsafe to be themselves.\n\nMost importantly, all this is decentralized. Everyone gets a say in who leads, how they lead, and what they do. Gitcoin founder Kevin Owocki puts it best [when he says](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/consent-of-the-governed-and-legitimacy-by-process-in-gitcoindao/9778), “The consent of the governed is the only legitimate basis for government.”\n\n# **Final Thoughts**\n\nDoing work you genuinely love should be easier than it is today. As humans, we should only have to do work stuff that we *actually enjoy* in workplaces that make it easy to be happy.\n\nI found these sorts of workplaces as an independent editor at [Craft Your Content](https://www.craftyourcontent.com/) and a writer at [Coin Central](https://coincentral.com/author/jemimah-jones/), both Web2-native companies.\n\nIt’s not impossible. It’s just easier when you work in regen Web3.\n\n**Things to note:**\n\n1. If you’re a manager at a traditional web2 company, consider that your team members (and company) will benefit from applying some principles in this post.\n2. If you’re like me, looking for the world’s best workplaces, consider contributing to a regen DAO. Here’s [how to contribute to GitcoinDAO](https://www.notion.so/8035f41cf1194022b03c579791f32ca7), where I work.\n3. If you do not consider anything I’ve shared, please consider avoiding situations that lead to Zombified-Worker Syndrome. You deserve better.\n\nLike this article?

{"id": "wJJQyzl87__muSIcHNv5r53_0GmoIKnAoK7ksKn0qKs", "title": "New consumption observation | Guochao Li Ning starts selling coffee | one trillion coffee market adds another cross-border giant | see you every day on the cover", "body": "Cover news reporter Wu Yujia\n\nRecently, Li Ning Sports (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. has applied for the registration of the trademark “Ning coffee”, officially announcing its entry into the coffee industry.\n\nShould the leader of sports brand “Guochao” layout the coffee market? For a time, it has aroused widespread concern in the industry. There are different opinions on whether to play tickets or test the water. According to some insiders, coffee is more “embellishment” stores for Li Ning group, but others believe that this is opening up a new track.\n\nDuring the discussion, Li Ning’s official response said: the company pays attention to the consumer purchase experience of retail terminals, hopes to improve customers’ comfort and experience during shopping by optimizing in store services, and provide coffee services in the store, which will be an innovative attempt of Li Ning for the consumer experience of retail terminals.\n\nFrom the official response, coffee for Li Ning is more about improving the store experience than trying to open up a new track.\n\nFirst of all, from a market perspective, coffee is one of the hottest consumption tracks in recent years. According to the data, in 2021, the scale of China’s coffee market was about 381.7 billion yuan. Some institutions predict that by 2025, the scale of the domestic coffee market will reach 1 trillion yuan, with a growth rate of 27.2%, far exceeding the global average of 2%. Facing the fast-growing track, capital has already poured in. According to data, from 2013 to 2021, coffee related projects were financed 114 times, with a disclosed amount of more than 11.5 billion yuan. Whether in terms of market scale or financing performance, the coffee track is worth Li Ning’s try.\n\nSecondly, from the development stage, as an emerging industry, China’s coffee market is still in a relatively early stage. There are many domestic coffee brands. Starbucks, Tim Hortons, Costa and other international chain coffee brands are positioned as slow coffee scenes, focusing on the third space social networking; The “slow coffee camp” represented by% Arabica, m stand and seesaw is more about building brand awareness through stores, paying attention to the creation of aesthetic atmosphere, and taking high-quality coffee as its own; Novartis coffee, Ruixing coffee and man coffee are the representatives of high price coffee. The “fast coffee scene” is used to meet the needs of people who take coffee as their daily needs, and take the cost-effective route.\n\nIn addition, there are also some new cross-border players. Many industry giants such as “two barrels of oil”, China Post, Wanda, Tongrentang and even Goubuli have been involved in the coffee business one after another. In 2018, PetroChina established “Kunlun hospitality coffee” and sold freshly ground coffee in its Kunlun hospitality convenience store. In 2021, “hospitable coffee” opened more than 120 stores in 20 provinces and cities, with sales of more than 100 million yuan. The product line includes freshly ground coffee and ready to drink coffee. In 2019, Sinopec Yijie convenience store with nearly 30000 stores released a new brand “Yijie coffee”. In October 2019, Tongrentang Health Pharmaceutical Group’s new retail brand “Zhima health” experience store opened and launched medlar latte, Luohanguo American style and other “herbal” coffee. In February 2022, China Post announced that the country’s first post office coffee shop would officially land in Xiamen. On February 23, Tianjin “Goubuli steamed stuffed bun” also announced its entry into the Bureau and established gaoleya coffee.\n\nWhat are Li Ning’s advantages in choosing to cross into the coffee track at this time? First, the number of stores. Compared with Ruixing with 6024 stores, Starbucks with 5654 stores in China and Nova coffee with more than 1500 stores in the same period, Li Ning coffee with more than 7000 outlets has certain advantages in scale. Once fully or partially launched, it is a force that can not be underestimated.\n\nSecondly, different from the brand positioning of professional coffee making, the core logic behind Li Ning’s move is more similar to the business idea of resource reuse or new satisfaction of traffic. By improving the store experience, attracting young consumer groups and approaching generation Z, Li Ning’s national fashion image of China is strengthened.\n\nInsiders pointed out that for brand entities, building scenes that consumers can experience and deeply perceive in time will become a key measure of market competition in the future.\n\nAs for whether this decision can really consolidate the brand barrier and become a new driving force for enterprises to move forward, it takes time to give the final answer.", "timestamp": 1653252903, "digest": "0HOkmLR_QcckY8V_ZC9w9qfwh37K40rfKExjzHLsWdI", "contributor": "0x587883E7cc65ED49d14a8763507733692d1E901C"}

Centered around on-chain ESG metrics, HASH DAO is focused on providing a growing open-source library of genetics, farming methods, hash processing, entheogenic plant treatment, and community healing protocols available through a multi-tiered token.\n\n**Creating the Future of Tech, Innovation, & Culture**\n\nHighly Autonomous Systems of Horticulture (**$HASH**) : Utilizing smart contracts to automate and democratize production, supply chain, and governance in the cannabis & psychedelic Industry.\n\nWe created $HASH to allow the craft growers who put the plant first and under-represented communities easier access into the cannabis space and the emerging technologies of Web3.\n\n*“Decades of marijuana prohibition and high incarceration rates for marijuana convictions has left many people out of the legal marijuana boom.”*\n\n> **Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over $20 Billion and is projected to 10x in the next decade.\n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\nCorporate cannabis companies operate and control the majority of the space, leaving legacy operators and small brands without capital solutions to scale their businesses and do not take into consideration all of it’s stakeholders :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oXXVXLuIXOQoXtXRqzBXV.png?height=621&width=904)\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of the BIPOC community for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands  exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market. With the integration of digital identities, NFTs/Web3 purchasing, and automation, many of these problems are easily solved.\n\n![Exclusive Libraries of Genetics & Phenos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-8T4OrLTcNOJxW2vLerl-.jpg?height=1866&width=1536)\n\n*Solution?* Creating community-ownership of the vertically-integrated $HASH Supply Chain of production, processing, distributing, and operating on-chain craft cannabis  compliance geared toward Web3 adoption. Information, data security, and their applications are essential for business optimization and transparency. Although there are many ERP solutions for the industry already, our governance will be centered around cannabis supply chain and DeFi dApps that utilize NFT-based SKU’s to generate active product data and create on-chain interactions that comply with ESG metrics, paving the way for global regulations and the future of the cannabis space.\n\nDeveloping Horticulture Public Goods : BIPOC Horticulture Initiative, Open-Source Library of Genetics, Strains and Phenos, Regenerative Farming Methods & Techniques, Cannabis Production, Processing, Entheogenic Cultivation, Medicinal Protocols, and a Community-Practitioner Directory\n\nCommunity-Governance over the liquidity, yield-farming, and major-user decisions in the tokenization of HASH DAO.\n\nHASH DAO Governance is the future of the industry standard, and to do this we will start by partnering with one successful Emerald Triangle, Northern California craft cannabis-brand with community-staking of its future scaling of operations and expanding a compilation of automation protocols through smart contracts.\n\n**ON-CHAIN SUPPLY NFTs + ACTIVE INVENTORY TRACKING + CRYPTO TRANSACTIONS = Web3 PoS**\n\n**World’s First Cannabis DAO Founded On**:\n\nBIPOC-equity and engineered around community-development governed by craft cannabis operators, backed by IRL projects.\n\n**On-Chain Protocols + Smart Contracts = The Automated Horticulture of Tomorrow**\n\nCreating a future:\n\n* Geared to the love and cultivation of the plant and Mother Earth\n* Onboarding BIPOC leaders and creatives onto the blockchain\n* Compensating intellectual property proportionally to fulfill smart contracts\n\n> **HASH DAO = Power Back in Your Hands**\n\nReinvention of the Horticulture Supply Chain and Data Distribution via smart contracts that allow for automation and help individuals to create ownership over community-led projects, intellectual property, digital assets, and dApps.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M6C2p0sNHx37p783TEv9D.jpg?height=822&width=1125)\n\n**First Wins for HASH DAO**\n\n> “Community Ownership of Physical and Digital Assets”\n\nMinting a multi-tiered HASH DAO NFT with the top governance tier going for $10 K, raising a total of $11.5 M for an initial $HASH treasury. As funds become available, proceeds will immediately go to partnering with South Face Mangement to purchase over 30 acres in Mendocino and 40+ acres Humbolt County. This will include the scaling of a vertically-integrated nursery and farm as well as it’s statewide distribution of award-winning products under Uncle Mac’s brand and South Face Farms Management.\n\n**Project #1 :**  Carry out renovation on the farm and nursery to ensure full-scale ESG-metric compliance and how to bring all aspects of the farm and it’s production on-chain, from SKU NFT’s to utilizing energy consumption data for carbon credit checks. Partnering with Uncle Mac’s, a Northern California craft cannabis brand, & South Face Management, parent company to Flower Wheel Nursery, South Face Farms Cultivation, and Uncle Mac’s brand.\n\n**Project #2 :** Onboard visual and 3D artists who will design branding and assets for the Metaverse and we develop cross-chain NFT’s to be dropped on various play-to-earn games. We will also be acquiring digital plots of real estate to build “Metaverse farms” and “digital dispensaries” where a user can view the product, find out all of it’s information, and have it eventually delivered through an on-chain transaction. Along with digital land we will also be investing in domain names, including various strain names, cannabis celebrities, and psychedelic culture. Explore liquidity pools and yield farming with assets and treasury.\n\n**Project #3 :** Developing the Whitethorne Wash House, operating at an Emerald Triangle legacy property. This on-chain Hash House, the home lab for Uncle Mac’s brand hash production, will operate as a wholesale fresh frozen supply chain solution for transportation, storage, distribution and hash toll processing.\n\n**Project #4** : Getting $HASH in your hands. This is our farm-to-table craft cannabis buyers club providing direct-to-consumer access to exclusive SKU’s from legacy brands in the Emerald Triangle. This will include obtaining a retail and event license to launch Nephew’s Automated.\n\n**Project #5 :** Aggregating a library of horticulture public goods & building the Biodiversity BIPOC Glamping Learning Initiative; start building Marijuana for Minorities Program to co-create $HASH University creating content with some of the best small-batch growers and washers in the industry. (Community Online Education)\n\n**Project #6 :** Nephew’s will be applying for its event space license building the foundation for Akasha, an immersive psychedelic A/R Lounge for BIPOC community healing. The distribution and delivery will be a warehouse that will have an on-chain ESG-metric system in the back and a public access immersive art space in the front. We will also be looking into developing a portfolio of boutique cannabis bud and breakfasts in emerging global cannabis markets.\n\n**Project #7 :** We will be finding ERP solutions to develop state-of-the-art horticulture automation and Web3 technologies, based upon on-chain governance and compliance, to pave the way for the international industry standard by working towards meeting ESG-metric compliance. Our final goal is developing complete automation systems without compromising craft horticulture. From driverless deliveries, farm drone surveillance & data collection to utilize machine-learning and AI and to understand buyer behavior, horticulture improvements, growth optimization, etc.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QcqQLT4DyBHuQRaaputgr.png?height=560&width=997)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653253005, "digest": "jnsLcgStN8lRzxU8kXxyzenqIy65Wc-9QjToTmHRd3M", "contributor": "0x954fA8cfb797a26D4878ee212004889a2C9D7624"}

(source: vogue fashion)\n\nFitness coach private teaching\n\nUnless you are not human, it is not possible to live 100% according to the health guidelines. Yes, we can try to choose a healthy breakfast, but no one can completely abandon alcohol, caffeine, starch and midnight snack! If you agree that the key to a healthy life lies in balance, rather than strictly adhering to a single healthy choice at every step, then we have some good news for you. The pursuit of a healthy life does not mean a complete innovation. Here are 25 simple tips told by the fitness coach. It is very simple to implement, but it can bring us great changes in the long run.\n\nBreathing training: conscious breathing will help stabilize hormones, calm stress and optimize metabolism and digestive system. If you don’t breathe properly, you may miss one of the basic ways to keep your best health. I encourage my guests to find five minutes a day, lie flat, raise their legs and try abdominal breathing Bridget Jane， New Leaf Nutriti\n\nPay attention to vitamin B intake: vitamin B intake from green leafy vegetables can help relieve stress, increase deep sleep, and make you more focused during the day—— Yoga instructor Dani Lieberman\n\nSleep with essential oil: use some essential oil in the bedroom when sleeping. My favorite is lavender fragrance, which can calm you down and get deeper sleep—— Marissa Vicario, integrated nutrition health coach\n\nEat less factory bred animal products: this can reduce the intake of chemical hormones and antibiotics. Or reduce adult meat intake, such as the meat free day every week, or choose grass fed and free fed ranch animal products - Jennifer cassetta, Institute for integrated nutrition health coach\n\nUse app to record: I will choose cycle tracking app to record my periodic changes. The app can help me understand the impact of my hormones on diet, stress, exercise and other living habits. It can also record your mood, physical symptoms, weight, drugs, sex and body temperature. Understanding your body is one of the basic elements of maintaining a long-term healthy life. An app can help you understand your body Bridget Jane， New Leaf Nutrition\n\nTips for fitness and weight loss\n\nTry canned salad: try some salad recipes that can be saved in cans. They are very simple and beautiful and can be used as a working lunch. Put your favorite ingredients in the glass for lunch every morning—— Maria Marlowe, Institute for integrated nutrition health coach\n\nDownload a meditation app: do you think such an app is a waste of time? Wrong! Just 10 minutes of meditation a day can make you work more efficiently and even help you make better decisions. I use Deepak choprah’s mediation app. “- Jennifer cassetta, Institute for integrated nutrition health coach and personal trainer\n\nStay away from refined sugar: in addition to weight gain, sugar is also the culprit of chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, heart disease, poor memory and diabetes. And the more you eat sugar, the more you crave sugar. Make a three-day sugar free diet plan. Because you don’t eat sugar at all, you won’t crave sugar too much. This meal includes healthy fats, proteins, vegetables and fruits. When your taste buds get used to the natural sweet food of fruit, you will soon find that the biscuits and desserts you used to talk about are too sweet for you now. If you reduce your refined sugar intake, you will become healthier and slimmer Maria Marlowe, Institute for integrated nutrition health coach and personal trainer\n\nTongue scraping: it sounds a little disgusting, but don’t be afraid. The tongue scraper can not only clean, but also inhibit dental plaque bacteria and make your Breath fresher. Tongue scraper is a U-shaped metal tool, which can be bought in pharmacies or online. It can scrape off bacteria and food residues on the surface of the tongue Marissa Vicario, Institute for integrated nutrition health coach and personal trainer\n\nEat more probiotics: it’s good to get started with probiotic supplements, but many people don’t seem to realize the benefits. Therefore, I would recommend that customers take probiotics through sauerkraut, kimchi and black tea fungus. Another benefit of this is that eating different foods allows you to harvest different intestinal bacteria that are good for you Robyn Youkilis, Institute for integrated nutrition health coach\n\nDon’t be lazy for the sake of good health\n\nPrepare a week’s menu in advance: preparing a menu in advance on Sunday can minimize the time you spend in the kitchen and make it easier to control a healthy eating plan for the whole week. Make a menu, roast vegetables, cook grains, and prepare a lot of protein. Then just heat it on weekdays. By mixing different ingredients, you don’t have to worry about getting bored eating the same thing all week Personal trainer, Marlowe Institute for nutrition", "timestamp": 1653253434, "digest": "MjrEvncA3WYBHsAR-t4zeBhc7JL--JNXuVDK_PMMUS8", "contributor": "0xDa0E4c747C5FED5243e69fcF4eDC3e327f170E1A"}

If those beautiful feelings and wishes are only cherished and enshrined on the table of expectation, they can only be eclipsed by the dust accumulated in the abrasion of years.\n\nAn autumn rain, a cold. When the temperature dropped suddenly, I opened the wardrobe and wanted to turn over a thick cotton padded jacket to keep out the cold, but I accidentally found a clothes tightly wrapped in several layers of plastic bags in the corner of the drawer at the bottom of the wardrobe. What kind of clothes are you taking care of so carefully? I haven’t worn it for a long time. I almost forget it. So I carefully peeled off the outer package layer by layer. It turned out to be an outdated but still straight and gorgeous wool skirt. Suddenly, an indescribable emotion came to my mind. This beautiful wool skirt was once a favorite dress I bought a few years ago. It is expensive and exquisite. But because I like it so much, I don’t want to wear it more. I wear it on my body only a few days after the annual Chinese new year, attending friends’ banquets and attending important meetings. Then I take care of it carefully and put it in the cabinet, like a devout monk silently worshipping his God in my heart.\n\nBut the number of times I wear it is too small. Over time, I gradually forget its existence. Until today, I see it as new, but it is out of date and can’t wear it out anymore. The love for it and the joy of wearing it all dissipated in the abrasion of these years, leaving only infinite regret. If only I had worn it more than once!\n\ntoo late to regret\n\nWe always habitually hide the people and things we love most carefully, and stubbornly think that we can always keep the beauty and the long joy at the moment, but we never know that happiness and joy are just a state of mind, and it also has a fresh-keeping period. If you don’t do what you want to do at the moment you value most, it will slip away. The scenery flows and the time and space changes. No matter how hard we try to recall, all we leave is a helpless sigh, “how I liked it at the beginning!”.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, my 88 year old grandmother died, which has become my eternal regret. Every spring when flowers bloom, I always want to take advantage of my spare time to take her trembling hand, take her through the mossy slate Road, out of the ancient alley, take her out of the creaking attic, go to the city where I live, see the colorful neons, stand in the high office building, see the flying fireflies on the viaduct, or go to the beach on the edge of the city, Look at the white waves on the beach and the skyline at the end of the sea.\n\nHowever, this wish has never been realized. My work is getting busier and busier, and there are more and more trivial things at home. Often on Grandma’s birthday, I can only rush back with a cake to have a good meal with her, and then I promise her, “next time, I will take time to take you!” This promise is carefully folded and enshrined in the cellar where there is no sunshine. It is full of dust on miscellaneous days and rots in the dense soil. I didn’t regret until I saw my grandmother lying on the hospital bed getting thinner and thinner, like an old tree with fallen leaves in the autumn wind. I listened to her nagging and vaguely reciting something to me. I let my tears fall.\n\nThe past can’t be changed, and the future can’t be guessed. All we can do is now to make the joy and happiness more mellow. Don’t let years run out of fragrance in waiting for empty checks; Don’t appreciate the sadness before you know how to cherish your clothes and the people in front of you.

Later, the company determined that Han Bing was inseparable from the company’s financial system problems and reported the case.\n\nAccording to the extraction, inspection and identification of the electronic data judicial identification center of the national information center and the judicial identification of Beijing Zhonghai Yixin Information Technology Co., Ltd. on the site of Lianjia company and Han Bing’s apple computer, the host name Yggdrasil and MAC address of the defendant Han Bing’s apple computer are consistent with the access terminal corresponding to the host name and IP address of the equipment accessed by the client ID assigned by the on-site login server on the day of the crime, The court found that in its behavior log on June 4, 2018, it was recorded that it logged in to the financial system to execute the - shred and - RM orders for deletion.\n\nAfter the identification of computer records and the video materials provided by the chain family, the court of first instance found Han Bing guilty of damaging the computer information system and sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment. Since then, Han Bing filed an appeal, and his defender believed that the facts of the case were unclear and the evidence was insufficient, which could not rule out reasonable doubt, and the suspected crime should be avoided. However, the court finally rejected the appeal in the second instance and upheld the original judgment.\n\nWith regard to the legal basis for the defendant Han Bing being sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment in this case, lawyer Xia Hailong of Shanghai Shenlong law firm analyzed to reporters 21 that according to the provisions of the criminal law, if the perpetrator commits the crime of destroying computer information system, the consequences are particularly serious, he shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of more than five years, According to the relevant provisions of the interpretation of the Supreme People’s court and the Supreme People’s Procuratorate on Several Issues concerning the application of law in handling criminal cases endangering the security of computer information systems, if the perpetrator causes an economic loss of more than 50000 yuan, it belongs to “the consequences are particularly serious”, and the benchmark punishment is more than five years. Based on the above provisions, in this case, Han Bing caused an economic loss of 180000 yuan and deleted the data as high as 9t, which obviously belongs to “the consequences are particularly serious”. He was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment, which is in line with the provisions of the criminal law.\n\nIn addition, whether the perpetrator has the circumstances of voluntary surrender and confession, and whether he pleads guilty or not will affect the final sentencing of the court. The defendant Han Bing refused to admit after deleting 9TB data of the company, and did not cooperate to provide computer and mobile phone passwords. Although the company spent 180000 yuan to repair the data, the circumstances were serious and finally sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment.\n\nIt has reflected the problems of the financial system several times, but it has not been paid attention to\n\nIn Han Bing’s testimony, the reason for deleting the database was not reflected. However, according to media reports, according to his colleagues, Han Bing found that there were security problems in the company’s financial system during his tenure, and sent an email to Zhang, another database administrator of the chain home. He reported the security problems of the financial system to several leaders twice and suggested that the company start a security project to repair the security problems, but it was not paid attention to.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Department of the financial line was assigned to the information line. They reported the security problems of the financial system to Zhou Xiaolong, the leader of the information line, and suggested to start a security project for repair, but it was still not adopted, and even had a dispute with Zhou Xiaolong in the process of making suggestions.\n\nAs for the phenomenon that other relevant persons involved ignored the potential safety hazards or did not act, lawyer Xia Hailong said that although there was no connection between the disregard and omission of other personnel of the company to the system risk and the crime committed by the defendant in this case, there was no instigation or assistance, and they did not have to bear criminal responsibility, but other personnel, such as the leaders of the above information line The director of the professional ethics construction center does not pay attention to the hidden danger of data security, and is also likely to violate the company’s internal management regulations or labor contract, so he needs to be liable for compensation to the company for relevant losses.\n\nHowever, for the criminal act committed by Han Bing himself, the defendant in this case, Lianjia company believes that the slowdown before his engagement and the lack of cooperation with the investigation afterwards are the culprits causing the final loss of the company. The director of the professional ethics construction center of Lianjia company also mentioned in his testimony that Han Bing came to the company in February 2018 to be responsible for the maintenance of the financial system, was transferred to the technical support department in May, and the workplace also changed. Han Bing has a problem with the organizational adjustment and feels that he is not taken seriously. After the adjustment, he slows down. After checking the company’s surveillance video, Han Bing often arrives late and leaves early, and is also absent from work.\n\nIn recent years, there have been frequent database deletion incidents in which employees retaliate against the company. How to maintain system security and compliance in the work involving enterprise information security and confidentiality has become particularly important. Lawyer Xia Hailong told reporters 21 that the company should take more effective technical means to strengthen the security protection of internal information system and data, disperse the authority of core system, increase the verification level, formulate a more standardized system security system, fill management loopholes, and avoid database deletion events caused by employees’ personal reasons to the greatest extent.\n\nThe discretion and judgment at the legal level are becoming increasingly clear and justified. “For whatever reason, employees’ unauthorized deletion of the company’s information and data is a serious violation of the company’s internal management system and will objectively cause losses to the company. Therefore, they will face the risk of termination of labor relations and compensation for losses", "timestamp": 1653253985, "digest": "J1vX8TO2pWPJQjOWPyHTo-ykUhSeXPamQwSNgxzIjXs", "contributor": "0x79aACBC0E746C1bc8e9849612b655Ed47414E45E"}
{"id": "TWg1L9rssF8EHuoFv-I-s8o5umjkeq2rYNqjzxWiTzI", "title": "My favourite game", "body": "I am a child of the 80’s. Born in ’73, my conscious mind really started to take shape in the years defined by E.T, Ghostbusters, Back to the Future and Star Wars…, Nintendo Hardware games (Orange Donkey Kong fold up…;), Big Tall Stereo towers, LP records, Neon Colors and my favorite game at that time… “ONDERUIT”. The game (called “Downfall” in English) is a strategic turn by turn game like Zeeslag (“Battleship”) or Vier op een Rij (“four in a row”), but it had something different to the rest. The gears that you would turn would influence the game of your opponent. I absolutely loved that. The objective of the game would be to unload your two times 5 Tokens that would feed in at the top. By turning the gears, the Tokens would fall into the special token spaces available in each of the 5 gears. You could move the tokens down to the catch reservoir at the bottom. Whoever did that the quickest way would win. I used to play this game a lot with my dad and my sister and had one strategy. I would always try to load up the final gear (which had space for 5 tokens) and prepare my turn to have maximum effect by dropping 5 Tokens in the reservoir at once… freaking out my competition…. In this case usually my sister.\n\n![ONDERUIT / DOWNFALL](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bOryJqsRX1PNFhCFS8cX6.png?height=220&width=426)\n\nOver the years, my 80’s influenced interests and average high school performance lead me to the doors of the university of Technology in Delft. A pretty overwhelming place for someone who actually just wanted to go to art school, but a place I look back to with much appreciation and gratitude for having the patients with a slow burner like myself.In Delft I learned to design industrial products and services. During my 12,5-year stay (at the time students could pretty much study forever) I learned to control my chaotic creative mind, using the abstract academic frameworks and pathways offered by the faculty of Industrial Design engineering. It took me some time to realize that the PROCESS of DESIGN was actually helping me to give order to my creative mind. Learning to see the difference between ideas, concepts and iterative prototypes and creating options as apposed to single minded focus on one idea, was one of the biggest lessons I took away from that place.\n\nWhen I started my first solo design company called “RIPPLE” (domain for sale by the way), I started to see the benefits of being able to create order and optionality in a world of entrepreneurial chaos, using frames or guidelines that would show an accountable path towards a desired end goal. This ended up literally becoming what I am still doing for clients today. [But that is another story](https://www.visuallyyours.nl).\n\nIt was after some time into my studies, doing assignments and miscellaneous design work for others, that I started to realize that I had developed a pattern of working. My own take on the Delft process of Design. Not a particular good pattern, but one that was similar to my one strategy in the “ONDERUIT” game I shared so enthusiastically at the start of this post.\n\nBefore I sat down with a client (or fellow students / professors) I would prepare a whole lot of work overwhelming them with a wall of visuals. Something that looked good and combined our shared perspectives. A story that felt like a credible well thought out direction that was ready to go and be successful. There are all kinds of things you can say about working like that, but for the purpose of this post the moment of sharing a lot of (visual) work is key. The moment I would share my in-between progress would feel exactly like dropping the 5 tokens in the reservoir! My 80’s game strategy when playing that kick-ass two person battle game, ended up becoming my preferred way of working whenever I would share my designs with others.\n\nSo now …you might be wondering why I would share this somewhat strange and bizarrely personal revelation with you in a random online post. The stories I am putting together on Mirror.xyz/DENACE.eth are part of a bigger picture that has to do with my own personal way of trying to connect with what I think could be the future of collaboration and personal identity…Web3. But am I ready for what it has to offer? Are my present capabilities ready for the future?\n\nThe virtual space we have come to know as the internet has been gaining speed. Both in its technical development and its cultural application. This means that the newer protocols, codes/algorithms and the attention on Artificial Intelligence are kind of forcing me to reevaluate the way I operate. Is the way that I design, the way I interact with others, the way online collaboration across the globe is enabling so many people to work and create so many amazing new things together, is that way compatible with my one strategy….my personal design framework?\n\nWhat this new space is doing for me now is kind of forcing me to test & challenge my old modus operandi. Does my visual abundance strategy, my desire to overwhelm people with visual work, does it still have a future in Web3?\n\nWhat I am seeing in my daily design doings is that the new iterations in our shared online space, are just too big to get our heads around. For designers and for our clients alike the promises of new relationships with ownership, responsibility & privacy might give you new reasons to worry, instead of opportunities to take advantage of. In order to understand what is changing and from what angles you can approach the Web3 potential, people will  need guidance or curated pathways to start and understand what the current changes in the landscape might mean for you.\n\nBecause it is happening in so many spaces at once, with so many people trying to create ways for you to connect to why it is important, it is a challenge to understand and see how the future of the internet is relevant to you.\n\nThese posts on Mirror & Medium will be my quest going forward in the development of small stories, that can show the way. My explorations will try to overwhelm you with a combination of writing and visualization, making it easier to relate to some of the main themes in Web3, like ownership, privacy, trust and collaboration.\n\nMy choice for Mirror as a platform lies entirely with Joshua Nuttall, with whom I am sharing the Perpetual Inquiry Journey. Since the beginning of 2021 I have been collaborating with Joshua Nuttall ([josh.mirror.xyz](https://josh.mirror.xyz/)) on a variety of projects in several Thinking domains.

Or the grey business of \"internal and external collusion\"", "body": "The third-party platform charges and recommends interns in the financial industry, which has caused a storm. Many institutions have denied the behavior of “charging internal promotion”\n\n“Tens of thousands of yuan to buy internships in financial institutions” is a scam\n\nAt the peak of College Students’ summer internship, a third-party platform “clearly priced” was sold to the “disclosure” of internship opportunities in financial institutions, which caused an uproar in the financial circle and college students. In this regard, a number of financial institutions have issued statements denying any form of “fee push” behavior. Some people in the financial industry pointed out that the behavior of “fee pushing” is likely to be a private transaction between internal employees of financial institutions and external third-party institutions.\n\nInternships in well-known financial institutions are the dream of many college graduates. If someone charges you 35000 yuan to recommend internship opportunities for you, will you pay? A few days ago, a microblog revealed that some third-party platforms carried out “fee push” business, which caused an uproar in the financial circle and college students. A number of financial institutions have issued official statements, saying that there is no “fee push” in any form, reminding everyone to apply through formal channels such as the official website. Many people in the financial circle also told the reporter of Beijing Youth Daily that regular financial institutions will not recruit fee interns, and the majority of students should beware of being cheated.\n\nBreak the news\n\nPay 50000 yuan to practice in investment banking companies\n\nThe so-called internal push is internal recommendation. When recruiting interns or regular employees, many enterprises are willing to let people inside the company recommend them. This practice can improve the recruitment efficiency, which is equivalent to adding a layer of interpersonal endorsement in addition to the normal examination and investigation. Some financial institutions also encourage internal employees to recommend talents for the company, and even reward the successful referrals. Originally, the recruitment information of these enterprises was completely open and the recruitment process was all free, but some platforms saw “business opportunities” to start the business of charging and pushing.\n\nAccording to the information exposed on Weibo, some training institutions taking “financial partners” as an example are actually selling internship opportunities for financial institutions in the name of job guidance for interns, involving many financial institutions, including some well-known banks and securities companies.\n\nBeiqing Daily reporter found that most large-scale platforms do not directly price internship opportunities, but are keen to launch expensive training packages.\n\nIn the “breaking news” of Weibo, a screenshot of an article from the “financial partner” official account shows that the training institution provides four different levels of packages with different charging standards, including courses and practical training (four weeks offline + two weeks offline), with a quotation of 11800 yuan; Online elite apprenticeship package (online training + 1-to-1 remote internship, recommendation letter can be provided), with a quotation of 15800 yuan. There are also exclusive packages and Xingyao packages requiring private letter inquiry, including courses and training + unlimited internships + two-year VIP + school recruitment VIP, etc.\n\nOn another platform called “disciple job search”, the reporter of Beiqing daily found that it launched the disciple plan of “ensuring to obtain internship 0ffer (employment)”, claiming that this plan is a “carefully built high-end private customized” project. This project aims at job matching for resumes, targeting target positions, whether remote, on-site, formal or full-time, and all positions in investment banks, public funds and foreign investment consulting. It also claims “accidental failure, full refund” in an “atmosphere”. As for the price, it is a single post, single pricing, and the price varies. A person who has contacted the job consultant of the platform disclosed that the quotation of the platform for different companies and positions ranges from 20000 to 60000 yuan.\n\nThe reporter of Beiqing daily also found that a few platforms that mainly promote through wechat even play the push price directly on the leaflet. For example, in a third-party organization’s “fee push” standard circulated on the Internet, investment banks, consulting, accounting firms, banks, FMCG and the Internet in the financial industry are covered. The companies cited include state-owned banks, four major accounting firms, well-known securities companies, Chinese funded and foreign-funded enterprises. The internship opportunities of FMCG and Internet companies with the lowest price are 19800 yuan, while the internship opportunities of investment banking companies need up to 52800 yuan.\n\ninvestigation\n\nAt least more than a dozen platforms engaged in “charging internal promotion”\n\nAccording to the incomplete statistics of the reporter of Beiqing daily, there are at least more than ten third-party institutions with some fame and scale engaged in similar internal push internship charging business.\n\nNetizens who have worked on similar platforms broke the news that these charging platforms are mainly for college students with internship and employment needs, and all provide various paid services and packages with clearly marked prices. The service content is also diverse, fully covering the full range of needs of job seekers. For example, basic training such as modifying resumes, delivering resumes, online interview skills training and career planning consulting are generally cheaper. The most attractive is the plan that can push inward and even guarantee offer. Generally, the charge is 5 digits.\n\nThese platforms will “viral” share the circle of friends, pull target customers into the group, and then send some articles and information in the group every day to attract everyone to buy services. The modification of resume is generally 100-400 yuan, and the help of professional HR (Human Resource Management) is 500-1000 yuan. Targeted internship posts are priced according to different situations. Ordinary securities companies are priced at 10000-20000 yuan. The higher the reputation, the higher the price. For example, a Chinese prefix securities company pushes a price of 45000 yuan, and those with good performance have room for retention; The internship position of the top investment bank in China is 60000 yuan, and the internship is guaranteed for 3 months.\n\nclarify\n\nMany financial institutions say it has nothing to do with the charging platform\n\nAfter microblogging exposed the industry chaos of “fee push” internship, many financial institutions issued public statements saying they had no cooperative relationship with these platforms.\n\nUBS group said in a statement that it has no cooperative relationship with any training unit, group or individual to internally recommend resumes, and has never edited, published or released any recruitment examination reference materials. UBS careers official website is the only official recruitment channel of the group in mainland China. Applicants who are interested in applying for UBS group apply for positions through official channels to guard against fraud. UBS Group reserves the right to investigate the legal liability of the publisher of false information.\n\nHuatai Securities also stated, “Huatai Securities recruitment official website is the only official channel for campus recruitment resumes.

Stephen Smith of “American Yang Yi” also angrily criticized 76 people.\n\nHe believes that the 76 people have no fighting spirit today, represented by nbid.\n\n“It’s the worst 76ers game I’ve seen in a long time,” Smith said. “There’s no fighting spirit, from the beginning to the end. It seems that they feel they’re still waiting for Game 6.”\n\nNbid scored only 17 points. Although he may have been affected by the injury, others have no excuse. A team without fighting spirit can’t beat the heat.\n\nAfter losing Tianwang mountain, the 76ers fell behind 2-3. Losing another game means being out. Their best result is to win the G6 and then go to Miami to compete with the heat. But if it’s today’s fighting spirit, they won’t have a chance to go to Miami at all.

It’s not a good feeling. We didn’t play well. We have to understand the requirements of the game. We need more ball rights in the other half. It’s difficult for the players to understand the concept of free man. We lack the simplicity required. But the team is efficient and we’re still fighting for second place.”\n\n“We have some important players missing, such as pique, pedry and Busquets, which affects the team. Nevertheless, we must play easily and more succinctly. Don’t lose so many goals.”\n\nHarvey praised demberle, who scored twice in assists: “sometimes he plays a decisive role, not only in scoring goals, but also in creating goals. Demberle almost helps the team rewrite the score to 1-0 by himself. In football, not only scoring goals, his assists can also play a decisive role.”\n\nFor Araujo, who suffered a concussion during the game, Harvey said that the players were kept in the hospital for observation overnight, but it was OK.\n\nOn the news that Manchester City signed Harland, Harvey said: “that’s what I said yesterday.

It’s about accountability, and taking responsibility for things we can control and understanding where we are vulnerable. Every discord we build should be built in mind with each and every single user being subject to compromise. Therefore, we have a PLAN in place BEFORE the attack, and do everything we can to mitigate and sometimes null the attack (before it takes place). But there is one role that must NEVER be compromised, and we can lock it down before the discord is open to the public.\n\n## Discord Creator/Founder Role\n\n![The discord creator/founder role is identified by the CROWN.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9pNu0CAI42af7dO2yqzFv.png?height=67&width=284)\n\nThe account that creates the discord should NEVER be an active USER in the server (once it is open) or even active anywhere outside of the server. It is OK if you use an active account to create the discord, but BEFORE going public, this role should be transferred to a burner account (preferably brand new account with email and discord name unassociated with the server/unrecognizable). This account is NOT used for anything else, other than being a ‘hardware wallet/ledger’ for the server. \n \n\n![This role can be transferred to ANYONE, but only by the user with the role. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z-qwDiAGit7tqsl0bucQR.png?height=126&width=184)\n\n \n No matter what the permissions and roles are in a server, no matter the hierarchy of those roles, the **FOUNDER/CREATOR** account bypasses all restrictions and has absolute control over the entire server and every role within it. The good news is, we can completely eliminate this attack vector and keep it in cold storage, unmarked and hidden away on the server. This account doesn’t need any special roles or identifiable markings and we in fact recommend keeping it that way. \n  \n Users may be able to use tools to figure it out, or discord itself may do a poor job of hiding it, but we do NOT need to bring any extra attention to this role, nor do we need to put it at risk by using it on an active account. With the account taken out of play and not in use, there is no chance of anyone phishing or gaining access to this account. Furthermore if an Admin is compromised, we always have one role above it, hidden and ready to ‘break in case of emergency’ and regain control of the server/eradicate the threat. If this role is ever compromised in this way, we know the attack came from within and limit it to only the person who had access to it being responsible.\n\n## Roles, Permissions, & Hierarchy\n\nThe next most vulnerable area of attack is ANYONE with administrator permissions in the server (humans and bots). Administrator permissions bypass ALL roles and restrictions within the discord and channels HOWEVER they still cannot change or alter the roles at or above them. This hierarchy of roles can be used to our advantage when structuring discord roles and permissions.\n\n![Subject to change, missing verification bot.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/F6xf2NACQwCapIOCRrmR6.png?height=674&width=677)\n\nUnderstanding ADMIN access is vulnerable to attack, we place the ONLY human role with admin at the very TOP (+) role and we only grant it to few individuals who need it. I recommend 2-3 at max, depending on the size of the server. I furthermore recommend that those working in this position understand they are NOT allowed to use these accounts to degen into other servers or operate on them for anything else other than doing their administrator work in the discords they are working on. It’s a lot of responsibility, it’s a job and should be treated as such. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TeYlyd392eMzpwYNbSLy-.png?height=246&width=218)\n\n \n Notice this role is neither hoisted, nor visible on the sidebar, nor is it colored and meant to stand out. The vanity roles which mark and signify Admin, Mod, and Team do NOT have Admin access and they are restricted only to the channels they need for their job.  \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_S9lbFudcm3_Jefh3uOHG.gif?height=442&width=536)\n\nThese roles have an identifiable color and mark, sometimes with emoji icons and hoisted above all other roles. We expect these roles to be targeted and plan for them to be compromised. Therefore we plan ahead of time to mitigate the damage anyone can do with these roles with this structure and limitation of perms. Again, the only true Admins of the server have the (+) role and no ONE can give them this role, except for the founder/creator role which is on ice and locked away. And those with this + role take on extra responsibility and limit their attack vectors and exposure. \n  \n After administrator permissions (which again bypasses all restrictions, except hierarchy of roles) the next biggest threat is who has access to INFORMATION channels, with the biggest targets being on #Announcements & #Official Links channels. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jy5bYbeigGGeeMs8WA7bo.png?height=842&width=1013)\n\nThe standard setup takes away everyone’s ability to write in this channel except for the intended user/role which overrides the nulled send message permission. Again Administrators still have absolute access and bypass all restrictions.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ztSxAiQQQn49fEfMnAgYX.png?height=850&width=1006)\n\nTherefore we NEVER grant anyone *permanent* control of these channels and limit their access with the (++) role. Only the true administrator (+) role has permanent access (as admin negates these restrictions) and only the (+) role can grant access.  \n  \n It is therefore recommend that his exchange of power and communication for it be done (off and away from discord). Either through the use of text, whatsapp, or other platforms. This way even if a users discord account is compromised, the attackers do NOT have a means to ask for access to these permissions (other than discord channels and DMs, which we will NEVER use to ask for these permissions).  \n  \n Now attackers need full use to an admins device (phone or computer) to entirely compromise them. These attackers are not doing this yet, but as we up our security they may which means we will need more security and practices outside of discord.\n\n## Trusted Bots\n\nAfter removing the attack vector from the Creator/Founder account, limiting attack vectors to only trusted admin (+) role, our last area of exposure are the bots we use and the permissions we grant them. For projects of larger scale, I highly recommend fully-custom built, in-house bots to limit exposure and responsibility. As much as we dislike Azuki’s founder, I do applaud their server for having no compromises as all their bots are custom built. They remain a high target and have completely avoided compromise, this is worth noting and paying attention to regardless of feelings towards Zagabond or their project. \n  \n Not everyone can afford this option, but for any project that is bringing in hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars, there is no excuse. The only other options are to completely remove all bots from the server (which takes away logs and much welcomed automation), or to have very limited bots in the server strictly permed for their roles, and having the structure setup in a way to prepare for their compromise.\n\n![This build is currently missing a verification gate, I believe I'd place it here - but this is subject to change. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/44gE4YUgygYuvzZohaJEM.png?height=426&width=678)\n\nAs it currently stands I have WICK above all other bots, with the quarantine role above them, but below Wick. This way we can rely on Wick to quarantine and remove all threats (including any of these bots being compromised). The problem with this build is that we are putting A LOT of faith in wick not being compromised. However, Wick is a PAID service and built with security in mind. Even if a user granted themselves a permission in this server, they wouldn’t be able to access and change the wick dashboard settings unless the server owner gave them access (which again, this account is locked away on cold storage).  \n  \n When a Mee6 employee was compromised, and they were able to bypass server settings and change permissions and roles, the one server with Wick operating as intended (PXN) was able to instantly & automatically remove any webhooks and posts in their announcement channel. This was because the user was NOT whitelisted to post on the backend/dashboard of Wick. Even though an admin was compromised, Wick still didn’t allow that admin to post. Again it still puts a lot of faith in Wick and if you operate a large-scale project, I recommend you make your own.\n\n## In Conclusion\n\nServer Creator/Founder should be kept on ice and taken out of play. Humans with Admin access and perms above all other roles should be very limited and ready to take full responsibility and accountability for their role. It should be a paid job and those in that position should understand how to properly build and manage a discord. \n  \n BOTs in the server should be very limited in permissions and channels for only their needed purpose and those that aren’t we should understand fully how much faith and trust we are granting in them (as much as an ADMIN) if they have administrator access. Depending on the size and scale of your business, understand what that means. \n  \n There are discords that have NEVER been compromised, or if compromised, had minimal damage (threats instantly eradicated). We should all understand why that was and open-source our security as much as possible to team up against these threats. Understand this does NOT replace a much needed job and position within this space as we can give someone the keys to a helicopter and they still cannot fly it, or the schematics to a building and not everyone can build it.", "timestamp": 1653255674, "digest": "KYe8hFL2h-zwuDbIMOBxjPSVooAeUkTcWa_UAkhu5aE", "contributor": "0x2f14fBa7f3b90DAA8DE0f35DfE0c6859cBB0034a"}

{"id": "keRusc3jYc5mpn0J_tpImkIfcFUjWuPhpDZSm9JSP0c", "title": "Smelling tumor? Zhejiang University research results crack the root cause of glioma", "body": "Beijing, Hangzhou, May 12 (Xie Panpan, Ke Yineng) how do tumors occur? It has always been a difficult problem for scientists. Zhejiang University has proved for the first time that there is a unique direct link between olfactory perception experience and glioma through a clear chain of evidence.\n\nThis achievement was published in the international top journal Nature on May 11, Beijing time. The first author of the paper is Chen Pengxiang, a doctoral student of the school of medicine of Zhejiang University, and the corresponding author is Liu Chong, a researcher of Liangzhu laboratory and a dual professor of the second College of Zhejiang University.\n\nGliomas with discoloration are the most common malignant primary intracranial tumors. The annual incidence rate is about 3-8 people /100000 people. The median survival time of patients is only 15 months from the discovery of disease to death. Patients need to receive multimodal treatment such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, immunotherapy and so on. At present, it is believed that the etiology of glioma is caused by the interaction between congenital genetic high-risk factors and carcinogenic factors in the acquired environment. However, it has not been determined how environmental stimuli are associated with disease.\n\nIn more than ten years of research, Liu Chong has been thinking about what factors can induce glioma?\n\n“The growth of tumor cells will communicate and transmit information with surrounding cells. Neurons are the basic functional unit of the brain and function through nerve discharge. Therefore, we focus on neuronal activity to explore whether it will affect the production of glioma.” Liu Chong introduced.\n\nTo uncover the relationship between environmental stimuli and glioma production, the first challenge is to build an experimental mouse model that can spontaneously produce glioma. Because the tumor is produced spontaneously rather than transplanted, it can really reflect the process of tumor formation in the brain.\n\nFacing this challenge, Liu Chong’s laboratory took several years to build a reliable animal model to simulate the generation process of glioma in human brain. Through rigorous analysis, the team found that the tumor mainly spontaneously occurred in the synaptic bulb layer of the olfactory bulb, that is, the information exchange area of the first level neurons (olfactory sensory neurons) and the second level neurons (called monk hat / cluster cells) of the olfactory loop.\n\n“Since the olfactory brain area is the prone site of gliomas, will the neuronal activity of the olfactory circuit affect the occurrence of gliomas?” This sudden “brain hole” has become the key of the whole research. Liu Chong’s team then further verified this conjecture.\n\nZhejiang University research team used cutting-edge chemical genetic interventions to accurately inhibit the activity of olfactory neurons in mice. The researchers found that after inhibiting the activity of olfactory sensory neurons, the tumor volume decreased significantly; After activating its activity, the tumor volume increased. The results showed that the excitatory activity of olfactory loop neurons was the root of glioma.\n\nIn order to verify the above conclusions, the team of Zhejiang University further blocked the unilateral olfactory input of mice through accurate physical blocking. After directly blocking the unilateral olfactory input of mice, the researchers found that the volume of tumors in the olfactory bulb of the blocked side brain decreased, which fully proved that olfactory stimulation can regulate the occurrence of gliomas.\n\n“This study is the first to intervene in spontaneous glioma formation by physical means, and also verifies the role of olfactory neural circuit in glioma formation.” Liu Chong said.\n\nAfter clarifying the olfactory neural circuit that induces glioma, the next step is to trace back to the source and find out what is the mechanism behind it?\n\nThrough in-depth analysis, Liu Chong’s team screened out that growth factor IGF-1 is a potentially important effector, and IGF-1 in the olfactory bulb is mainly expressed in the second-order neurons of the olfactory loop, monk cap / cluster cells. Based on the above findings, the researchers constructed a new mouse model, which can simultaneously simulate the occurrence of glioma and remove IGF-1 specifically derived from monk hat / cluster cells. The results showed that after knockout of IGF-1 in monk hat / cluster cells, the tumor volume decreased significantly. Subsequently, the team activated olfactory sensory neurons and blocked IGF-1 signaling pathway on this mouse tumor model, and found that the tumor promoting effect caused by olfactory activation was completely eliminated. It is clearly proved that olfactory activity mainly regulates the occurrence of glioma through IGF-1 signaling pathway.\n\nLiu Chong said, “in the whole glioma occurrence loop, the monk hat / cluster cells in the olfactory loop are stimulated by olfaction to secrete growth factor IGF-1, which is equivalent to the growth signal sent by the radio wave transmitting tower. This signal is received by the growth factor receptor on the tumor cell, which is like the radio wave is received by the antenna, and then transmitted to the tumor cell to start the process of cell malignant transformation and proliferation.”\n\nOver the years, based on the long-term cooperation with the neurosurgery department of the second hospital of Zhejiang University, Liu Chong laboratory has been paying attention to the research and development of the origin of nervous system tumor cells, tumor evolution mechanism and personalized treatment strategy. The publication of the latest results reveals that external sensation (olfactory stimulation) can directly affect the occurrence of glioma from a new perspective.\n\nLiu Chong said that this achievement provides unlimited thinking space for the follow-up to further explore whether different sensory stimuli (such as vision, hearing, taste, touch, etc.), even emotional stress and abnormal neurological function related diseases will also affect the occurrence of tumors. The in-depth exploration based on this research can help people better understand the basic biological problem of the essence of tumorigenesis, and provide a new direction for the prevention, early intervention and treatment of glioma.

DAO如果想实现（有代币门槛的）“一人一票”投票机制，往往得依赖web2的基础设施，如社交媒体个人资料，来对抗女巫攻击（用程序生成大量机器人模拟真人行为）。\n3. Web3建设者在各个DAO建设中都做出了贡献，但这种贡献却无法直接与其链上的身份绑定，导致其在求职时可能依然需要走Web2的简历填写等流程。\n4. 一些NFT项目声称自己是由某知名艺术家创作的，但这种创作无法在链上得到直接验证。用户只有通过Web2社交媒体联系艺术家来验证真伪，若无法联系或得不到及时澄清，容易上当受骗。\n\n因此，Web3原生身份组件的构建，对于Web3的进一步繁荣发展是至关重要的。行业内一般称这类身份组件为去中心化身份（DID）。\n\n## 二、DID的枢纽位置与应用场景\n\nAmber Group，全球顶级的crypto金融服务商，于2021年11月勾勒了DID的生态系统，详见下图：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6jTUS1eIVJbuF1MJfmExt.png?height=1470&width=1430)\n\n在这幅图中，DID位于Layer3，处于整个生态的枢纽位置。\n\n在DID的上游，是Layer1-共识标准层和Layer2-基础设施：\n\n* 共识标准层可以简单理解为对Web3身份表示的各种标准规范的制定，目前主要参与方是为W3C（万维网联盟）和DIF（去中心化身份基金会）\n* 基础设施层中，最值得关注的是.bit、ENS等域名项目 —— 由于域名可以绑定地址、地址本身难以记忆，未来Web3世界中每个人的“姓名”很可能会以域名的形式进行展示。\n\n在DID的下游，是众多依赖于DID的应用项目。个人认为，当前对DID最为迫切的三类应用项目，是不完全抵押借贷、DAO治理工具、Web3社交：\n\n* 不完全抵押借贷曾是Defi中的一大探索方向，曾经也有Goldfinch等有一定影响力的项目，但它们并不成功，TVL接近归0；但是，如果有了身份约束、甚至链下真人的唯一性认证，用户就不得不考虑到违约所要付出的信用成本，这和真实世界借贷相类似。\n* 在DAO治理投票、包括项目对早期用户贡献的衡量中，如何识别哪些用户为真人、哪些是机器人一直是一大难题。当DID成熟之后，DAO治理也将会走向新的高度。\n* Web3原生的社交项目目前并没有非常成功的，其中的一个因素就是缺少现实真人在链上的实体映射：每个用户可能有多个地址，且地址之间的交易局限于金融行为而缺少社交行为。DID的出现将为Web3社交项目的发展提供新思路。\n\n值得注意的是，由于DID目前的成熟形态尚不清晰，不少DID项目的分类在不同的地方也不一样，这个问题也将会在后文进行探讨。有时候一些本属于socialfi、defi类的赛道也会被归为DID赛道的项目，对此我们不必纠结。\n\n下面，让我们来看看当前的DID项目是如何做出解决上述问题的尝试的。\n\n## 三、DID项目的大致划分及其代表方案\n\n上文提到，Web3中不同的应用场景都对DID提出了需求。对于不同需求的侧重，当前的DID项目可以大致划分为四类：链下身份认证类、链上身份聚合类、链上信用评分类、链上行为认证类。\n\n### 3.1 链下身份认证\n\n将链下的真人身份信息与链上地址绑定，是一个看似有吸引力的解决Web3身份问题的方案：\n\n假设一个人毕业于斯坦福大学，曾在谷歌当工程师，在硅谷有两套房产。如果上述信息能够得到认证而与这个人持有的一个地址绑定，那么这些链下的荣誉和财产也将为他在链上的社交、借贷等各种活动提供加持 —— 比如他想认识斯坦福的校友，抑或是他希望进行一些抵押率相对较低的借贷。\n\n然而，现阶段如果想要做信息层面的绑定验证，是相当困难的。这其中最关键的原因，在于这些链下行为无法在链上得到验证，从而使得其审核依赖于中心化机构。比如想实现一个简单的工作单位认证，都需要这些工作单位配合上链进行审核操作，考虑到当前Web3的大众普及率和上手门槛，这对于项目的推广是相当困难的；更进一步的，如果要做工作中的项目经历认证，更是为审查困难、串谋作弊提供了可能 —— 毕竟这些东西都不在链上。\n\n因此，希望挑战链下信息验证的项目寥寥无几。在A16Z去年11月的文章中，提到Violet项目在做这方面的尝试，不过其官网仍没有其具体方案的展示。\n\n既然如此，现在涉及到链下身份的DID项目，更多的侧重于“唯一真人身份绑定”。这还是有比较成熟的技术方案的，那就是视频人脸识别。\n\nBrightID是真人身份验证的代表性项目，目前其已有超过5.7万名用户。用户需要预约zoom视频会议，通过人脸识别和验证官的复核来做BrightID的唯一身份认证；如果用户之前已经做过认证，就无法再创建新的账号，只能申请身份恢复。\n\n![BrightID APP的主界面](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tfMryU5b5vi4aIqiypfsv.png?height=1926&width=3292)\n\n![BrightID通过Zoom视频会议进行唯一性认证](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J-8sX-xRcUaJx6qGr2mBg.png?height=1922&width=3638)\n\nBrightID的当前主要应用场景，来自部分项目方开展项目时的“一人一号”需求，如比如经过BrightID认证后才能领空投。目前Gitcoin、RabbitHole、Status 等多个项目都已经采用BrightID。\n\n除了BrightID以外，Verite也是个值得关注的身份标准。它由UDSC的发行方Circle公司于5月10日推出，其中KYC是其身份验证的关键之一，具体KYC的形式和产品的设计有待项目方进一步披露。不过个人认为，视频人脸认证是比要提供护照、身份证等进一步真人隐私信息等KYC更合适的方案。\n\n### 3.2 链上身份聚合\n\n这类的DID项目并没有关注用户线下的情况，而是通过“数字身份”这一概念，来实现用户的链上信息的聚合管理，甚至进而成为用户在web3世界的入口。\n\n这里面隐含着一个深层次的假设：Web3应用的服务对象应该是“数字人”而非真人，每位现实世界中的用户可以选择在Web3中构建多个数字身份。当然，每个人的时间精力总是有限的，因此这些数字身份总有主次、领域侧重之分，但这没有关系。如果用户要凭借一个成熟的数字身份做出违约、欺诈等行为，这意味着他可能会失去之前构建这个数字身份所做的一切努力。\n\nUnipass是这类项目的代表之一，它做的事情正是链上身份的聚合管理：通过一个Unipass ID，用户可以绑定邮箱、多个ETH地址，并且还搭建了社交图谱（CyberConnect）、信息聚合平台（RSS3）等应用层协议。通过这种不断的聚合和对应用层的整合、屏蔽，之后Unipass甚至可能成为用户在Web3入口，变成用户在Web3的“One Pass”。\n\n![Unipass APP主界面](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EMDIjmTqxg-pnPn5bUVkf.png?height=1952&width=3162)\n\n可以看出，Unipass是一个野心很大的项目，它的终极目标其实是取代钱包在当前Web3的生态位 —— 但其方案必然会与钱包项目起冲突，不少应用项目恐怕也不希望被“协议化”而失去流量入口。从更高的视角来看，对Web3的入口的竞争无疑是相当激烈的，未来Metamask等钱包项目很可能也会朝着链上身份聚合这个方向发展。\n\n> 关于Unipass的更多展望，可以参考Nervos Network对Unipass项目方的访谈：[A Conversation with UniPass: Your Free Web3 Account](https://medium.com/@nervosnetwork/a-conversation-with-unipass-your-free-web3-account-ce5ed52f73bc)\n\n另一类值得关注的项目以Spruce为代表。Spruce想做的事情简单来说，就是构建一个跨平台、跨公链的身份认证系统。比如，用户可以基于 SpruceID 的认证插件使用以太坊账户，直接登录 discord，不用二次信息验证。\n\n可以看出，Spruce的身份认证，更多体现在Web3公链地址与Web2各平台账号的互通与融合上。与Web2现有平台账号的绑定，对于一些已经在Web2中有一定成就和影响力的人而言，无疑是一个很不错身份增强方案 —— 例如一个几百万粉丝的Twitter大V，其去做借贷的时候很可能可以得到更优惠的抵押率和利率。\n\n![流程图： oidc.login.xyz 服务器如何帮助Spruce进行身份验证](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jMZLq-VoQChQYCsnri0OS.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nSpruce于2022年4月20日完成A轮3400万美元融资，由A16Z领投。由于Spruce的实现涉及到许多技术挑战，其应用目前尚未上线，不过项目方会在官方不时披露其开发进度。\n\n### 3.3 链上信用评分\n\n这类项目的初心非常直接 —— 拓展Defi借贷的场景，把现实世界中金融行业的信用机制在Web3中找到某种实现，以提高Defi的资源配置效率。\n\nARCx可以看做此类项目的一个代表。它于2022年5月13日完成新一轮融资，由 Dragonfly Capital、Scalar Capital 和 Ledger Prime 领投。\n\nARCx通过发行「DeFi Passport」，根据每个 DeFi Passport 持有者的信用分来量化其链上地址的信誉度。信用分将通过分析持有者的以太坊地址历史活动来确定，其范围设置为 0 到 999 分，该信用分确定了协议为用户提供的抵押率。对于信用分高的地址而言，DeFi Passport 能够提供有竞争力的借贷抵押。\n\n![ARCx官网截图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KrgqTjMZzL0ult0FkuoO9.png?height=1246&width=1360)\n\n可以看出，相比于前两类DID项目，链上信用评分类项目更聚焦于用户的“数字金融身份”，使用的也多是用户的链上交易数据而非其社交行为数据，这使得其很难朝完整的DID项目发展。但鉴于金融活动在Web3当前的重要地位，信用评分类项目也将会是完整DID生态中不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### 3.4 链上行为认证\n\n如果说前三类项目都聚焦于对用户的身份状态作出静态的整理与评估，那么最后一类项目就显得比较特殊了 —— 它是对用户的身份状态作出动态的更新。这类项目的核心逻辑是，引导用户参与某些合作方要求的活动、行为，并对其颁发链上的认证。\n\n显然的，这类项目本身并没有给用户一个DID，更多的是对用户现有DID的不断补充。这类项目在DID的生态中也占有很重要的地位 —— 毕竟某种意义上，是它们定义了什么是“\n数字身份”的组成部分。\n\nProject Galaxy是这个方向的明星项目，其代币于2022年5月4日在Binance上线。Project Galaxy也被称为“数据凭证网络”，这里的“凭证”，就是为行为认证的具体表达。\n\n> 用户连接钱包后即可生成一张“银河身份证”，证件上会根据地址的历史行为，自动贴上「认证证书」，比如「Uniswap 交易员」、「OpenSea 交易员」等等。这些凭证如同现实世界的各种职业资格证一般，在某些特定场景会发挥价值。\n\nProject Galaxy最大的应用场景，就是帮助项目方利用凭证数据来构建更好的产品和社区，成为连接项目方和用户的平台。比如项目方希望用户进行某种链上活动后才能获取空投资格，Project Galaxy就可以帮助项目方识别这种链上活动并颁发凭证，既方便项目方的空投管理，也赋予了用户更多的价值感。\n\n![项目方把活动任务挂在Project Galaxy上](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ldyd9CJ4ijpBRRENhgYxJ.png?height=1588&width=2658)\n\n另外一个值得介绍的项目是Rabbithole，它是“学习认证”类项目的代表。它希望游戏化思维，将每个去中心化应用分解为游戏任务，引导用户与区块链协议、去中心化应用进行交互，培育 DeFi 用户的使用习惯，同时用户的 Web3 操作和行为还将获得“认证”。从某种意义上，Rabbithole项目正在给未来的课程结业证书、甚至简历构建打下雏形。\n\n![Rabbithole的技能学习](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ofhd4KyscsoUFy0MaV-qg.png?height=1332&width=2320)\n\n## 4. 未来展望\n\n通过上述的分析，可以看出目前DID的发展依然处于早期探索阶段，有不少关键的问题仍然需要Web3建设者们去探索。对于这些问题，个人观点如下：\n\n**最关键的问题，是DID的产品形态之争**：DID会像Unipass那样，朝Web3的入口方向发展，与钱包赛道相融合？还是会作为承上启下的枢纽，提供对用户真人鉴定、信用评分等协议接口，服务于各种上层应用？还是还是短期内更偏向于和Web2各平台的融合，通过“与Web2共存”的方式来强化认证的可靠性和有效性？也许这三条道路会是相互交融的，甚至也许还可能有别的道路，这些目前都还没有答案。**个人倾向于认为它会发展成为Web3的入口 —— 毕竟在大众用户的心智中，总需要一个尽可能简单、全面的“入口”**。当前类似于Metamask的钱包在全面性上做的远远不够，而聚合类的DID或许是一个方案。Web1的门户网站、Web2的搜索引擎、移动互联网中微信使用时长的不断提升和小程序生态的繁荣，都印证了这一点。\n\n**其次重要的问题，是关于“数字人”与“真人”之争**：Web3应用的服务方到底应该是链下的真人，还是链下真人在数字世界中创建的镜像？后者似乎更加符合Web3的理念初心，但从Web3的全球监管合规化和大众普及角度考虑，真人的验证或许将是难以避免的。个**人认为，未来不排除这两者有共存的可能：经过真人认证的账号将在Web3世界中享有更多的权利，但纯粹的数字人依然也会被接受**。\n\n**另外衍生的问题，是关于隐私保护的问题**：随着各种认证、评分的增多，甚至是真人链下信息的绑定，总有一些信息用户是不希望暴露在链上、可被随时查看的。当然，用户也不会希望这些数据放在项目方的中心化数据库里，这样就失去Web3的意义了。如何保护用户的身份信息，仅让其在必要的时候披露给必要的对象，也是DID在技术实现中所要面临的问题。\n\n综上所述，DID赛道依然处于混沌的“莽荒时代”，这也将会是各路冒险家大展身手的舞台。\n\n## 5.投资建议\n\n虽然不少DID赛道的项目已经公开发行了代币，但多数项目的币价最高点往往出现在2021年11-12月的时候，现在的币价相比于最高点都有非常大的回落，有兴趣的读者可以去具体做些搜寻。\n\n为什么会出现这种情况？\n\n从情绪面上来看，21年底的时候正值新一轮牛市，随着Roblox的上市和Sandbox、Decentralized Land项目币价的飙升，“元宇宙”“Web3”相关概念异常火热，DID作为Web3的枢纽，也引来了社区情绪的FOMO。而在5月的现在，随着BTC、美股的层层下跌，再加上LUNA崩盘事件的阴影，社区的情绪是极度恐慌的，对于这类发展\n\n从项目基本面来看，DID本质上也属于偏基础设施的赛道。多数项目的代币难以构建很好的经济模型和应用场景，再加上其并不多的用户数、不高的增长速度，社区情绪过后引发币价下跌，也是一件可以理解的事情。\n\n从行业基本面来看，DID虽然确实是Web3发展的一大瓶颈所在，但它并不是唯一的瓶颈 —— 基础设施的不完善、用户上手成本的高昂等，都是老生常谈的其它问题。现在Web3在应用层可以说是“超金融化”的，除了Defi借贷、NFT交易等个别与用户交易行为直接关联的赛道之外，多数依然处于探索期，而DID的发展毕竟是需要真实应用场景做支撑的。在应用层如此现状之下，多数DID项目的用户数据不佳，也是可以理解的。\n\n因此，经过如上分析，**当下时点个人并不建议对DID项目采取短线投资的策略。毕竟短期内这些项目很难有高增长和大爆发，再加上整体市场依然在走熊，这些项目的币价很可能仍然存在下跌空间**。\n\n**但从长期来看，Web3若要实现真正的井喷式发展，必须要有成熟的DID解决方案，一定会有项目成为赛道龙头。所以，不妨用风险投资的思维，在自己看好的项目足够便宜的时候买入并长期持有，期待其将来成为赛道头部，实现数十倍乃至数百倍的回报**。\n\n###

{"id": "Lqhwv_mlfGgH-zKEGaOKU3Z2sIAwPJ3s7uoK0OlvNL0", "title": "An Introduction to zkSync", "body": "[zkSync](https://zksync.io/) is a L2 blockchain that uses zkRollups to enable high throughput and low-gas transfers. This post is my understanding of zkSync and zkRollups. The following topics are discussed in this post:\n\n* The blockchain trilemma and goal of layer 2 scaling solutions.\n* A definition of zkSync, zkRollup, and zkSNARK.\n* An explanation of how zkSync achieves high throughput, fast finality, and low-gas transfers.\n\nThis is written in May 2022. The accuracy of information in this post can change based on upgrades to zkSync or Ethereum.\n\n## The Scalability Problem\n\nEthereum is a decentralized and secure blockchain, but it’s not scalable due to its low throughput of roughly [15 transactions per second](https://ethtps.info/Network/Ethereum). When the network gets busy, transaction speed slows down, resulting in a queue of transactions. During slow speeds, users participate in a bidding war, increasing their gas prices in an effort to jump the queue and get included in the next block. Ethereum miners change the order of transactions in favor of those with the highest priority fee. This creates a slow and expensive user experience.\n\nThe goal of scalability is to increase transaction throughput and speed of finality. The challenge is doing this without sacrificing decentralization or security. This challenge is known as the [blockchain trilemma](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-the-blockchain-trilemma), the idea that blockchains can only achieve two out of the three properties with respect to decentralization, security, and scalability. In an attempt to solve the blockchain trilemma, upgrades to Ethereum aim to make the network more scalable and secure without sacrificing decentralization.\n\nThere are many [approaches](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/#scaling-overview) to scaling Ethereum, including on-chain solutions like sharding and off-chain solutions like plasma, state channels, rollups, and sidechains. Layer 2 (L2) is a category of scaling solutions that consists of smart contracts deployed on Layer 1 (L1) that are responsible for processing deposits, withdrawals, and verifying proofs, while computation and storage are performed off-chain. Unlike sidechains, L2 inherits the security of the L1 network. It is one of the most promising scaling solutions available today. There are currently three main L2 solutions: State Channels, Plasma, and Rollups.\n\n## zkRollups, zkProofs, zk-SNARKs\n\nA rollup is a type of L2 scaling solution that batches transactions off-chain and submits them to L1 as a single transaction. There are two types of rollups, Oprimistic Rollups and [Zero Knowledge Rollups (zkRollups)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/). In this post, I will only cover zkRollups, the scaling mechanism used by zkSync. zkRollups is a type of rollup that uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to prove the validity of transactions in a rollup block (batch of transactions).\n\nZero Knowledge (ZK) refers to one party being able to prove to another that a particular set of information is true, without revealing what that information is, hence there is zero knowledge of the information but there is proof that it exists. [Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK)](https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/) is a type of ZKP used by zkRollups. A zk-SNARK is generated for each rollup block which is then verified on-chain by the L1 contract. Each zk-SNARK includes a proof of the validity of every single transaction in a rollup block.\n\nProcessing transactions off-chain enables rollups to increase throughput. Computation executed off-chain does not affect the speed of the on-chain part of the transaction. Rollups use compression to reduce the size of on-chain data. By reducing the size of on-chain data, rollups not only increase finality speeds, but they reduce the cost of gas. Having less on-chain data saves processing power, time, and storage.\n\n## The Contender\n\n[zkSync](https://zksync.io/) is a L2 blockchain that uses zkRollups to enable high transaction throughput and low-gas transfers.\n\n**High Transaction Throughput**\n\nzkSync scales transaction throughput with speeds of [2000+ transactions per second](https://docs.zksync.io/zkevm/#basics). It achieves this by reducing the amount of on-chain transaction data, allowing for transactions to be processed more quickly and for more transactions to fit in a block. Only a cryptographic proof and the state delta (the change in the state of the L2 blockchain) are stored on-chain.\n\n**Fast Finality**\n\nFinality in a rollup block can be reached in as fast as 10 minutes. Transactions in zkSync reach finality as soon as a SNARK proof for a particular rollup block is posted and verified by the L1 smart contract. This is a significant advantage over Fraud Proofs, which require up to 7 days for a transaction to reach finality.\n\nThe off-chain confirmation for transactions on zkSync are [instant](https://docs.zksync.io/userdocs/tech.html#instant-confirmations), however, users still rely on the validator to include the transaction in a rollup block. In the future, zkSync validators will be required to add a [security bond](https://docs.zksync.io/userdocs/tech.html#instant-confirmations) to the network as an economic guarantee that they will include the transaction in a rollup block.\n\n**Low Gas Fees**\n\nAs a result of using SNARK validity proofs and compressing on-chain data, zkSync is able to reduce gas costs by [up to 200x](https://docs.zksync.io/userdocs/tech.html#zk-rollup-architecture) compared to a L1 transaction. SNARKs allow zkSync to only store the SNARK itself and the state delta on-chain. Everything else is computed and stored off-chain, where operation costs are fractions of a cent per transaction. The data for every rollup block is published as a root hash in L1 calldata, the lowest-cost data location. By bundling thousands of transactions, users split the cost of a single L1 transaction, reducing gas costs even further.\n\n**Gasless Meta-Transactions**\n\nzkSync supports gasless meta-transactions, enabling users to pay gas fees in the token being transferred. Meta-transactions are transactions in which a relayer pays the gas fee in ether on behalf of the sender. Dapps on zkSync can choose to sponsor the fee or they can have validators accept ERC-20 tokens for gas fees. This abstracts gas from the UX because it no longer requires users to have an ether balance or adjust gas settings.\n\n**Scalable Payments**\n\nGiven the low-gas transfers and high throughput of zkRollups, zkSync works as an exceptional solution for scalable payments. With transaction throughput equal to, if not greater than Visa, zkSync can be used as a payment solution for p2p, e-commerce, retail, and more. [zkCheckout](https://checkout.zksync.io/link) allows users to accept token payments on zkSync via payment links that function as payable invoices. Developers can use the [zkCheckout SDK](https://docs.zksync.io/api/sdk/checkout/tutorial.html#structure-of-the-tutorial) to implement payments via zkSync onto any website. zkCheckout has already been implemented into [Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-grants-round-8/) as a checkout option.\n\n**Mainnet-Level Security**\n\nBecause zkSync is a L2 solution, it inherits the security and decentralization of Ethereum. Once the rollup block is verified and produced in L1, it is immutable. Users do not have to rely on 3rd parties or validators for the security of their funds. Validators are not able to corrupt the state of the L2 blockchain nor steal user funds. If zkSync validators stop cooperating and fail to include user transactions in a rollup block, users can use an emergency exit function to withdraw funds back to L1. There is no operational activity required on zkSync to keep the funds safe.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEthereum L2 scaling solutions are live and thriving with close to [$5 billion](https://l2beat.com/) in combined TVL. Currently, there are several implementations of an EVM-compatible Optimistic Rollup. zkRollups are getting there, with several projects working towards EVM-compatibility. The scaling and gas improvements brought forward by zkSync are a significant step towards mass crypto adoption.\n\nSmart contract support will come at the release of [zkSync 2.0,](https://docs.zksync.io/zkevm/#general) an upgrade that will include an EVM-compatible zkRollup. It will enable existing Ethereum applications to seamlessly launch on zkSync as well as allow Solidity developers to building natively on L2. The uptick in banking on a fast, cheap, and secure L2 is near.\n\n__\n\nFeedback? Message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/silecrypto). \n Questions?

On May 11, the relevant person in charge of the Ministry of transport responded to social hot issues such as how to ensure connectivity and people’s livelihood.\n\nLet the truck run and let the logistics pass\n\nIn view of the problems encountered by many truck drivers during transportation due to the epidemic in recent times, the relevant person in charge of the Ministry of transport introduced that it has guided all localities to classify and accurately implement truck traffic guarantee measures, implement the requirements of “pick and go” and “closed-loop management”, and effectively ensure the smooth passage of freight vehicles.\n\nHanjinghua, deputy director of the transportation service department of the Ministry of transport: all localities are required to accurately implement traffic control according to the actual travel of freight vehicles and drivers and passengers, whether they are involved in epidemic diseases, etc., and shall not use the place of origin and registered residence as the conditions for restricting traffic. It is required to completely cancel the restrictions on the epidemic prevention access of freight vehicles from low-risk areas. For freight vehicles with drivers and passengers from low-risk areas, that is, the green communication travel card without  sign, all localities shall not restrict the access at will.\n\nMake every effort to ensure smooth logistics in key areas\n\nAt present, the epidemic situation in the Yangtze River Delta is still grim. The Ministry of transport said that it should go all out to ensure smooth logistics in key areas. For enterprises included in the “white list” of the supply chain, priority transportation capacity support, priority loading and unloading, priority distribution and other services shall be taken.\n\nTake multiple measures to smooth the “last mile” of urban distribution\n\nIn addition, in order to solve the “last mile” problem of urban material distribution, the Ministry of transport will guide all localities to unseal the closed postal express distribution centers, business outlets and express service stations in an orderly manner on the premise of meeting the epidemic prevention requirements and strictly implementing the epidemic prevention and control measures.\n\nHan Jinghua, deputy director of the transportation service department of the Ministry of transport: focusing on the guarantee of operation and transfer, guide all localities to delimit the logistics distribution node network outside the sealing area as far as possible to ensure the orderly operation of the network; If the logistics distribution node is located outside the sealing area, control area and prevention area, it shall not be shut down without authorization; If it is really necessary to shut down the transfer of inter provincial and inter municipal production and living materials and mail express within the prevention area and control area, it shall be submitted to the provincial and municipal joint prevention and control mechanism for approval according to the procedures.", "timestamp": 1653257285, "digest": "TpXxBAgZQdHs_M7EJuckGVXKx8Wap6Qs7a0rpS5y5eQ", "contributor": "0x2bE779A9677054C0C1644185E59BE05AaD3Ed764"}
{"id": "Y27sCzFvmKobOJliFaS4i1xSrihZL5IGgREntHsIaC8", "title": "Securing Discord ", "body": "Permissions and roles, the administrator needs to understand every permission and role in order to limit the attack vector and limit exposure. It’s about accountability, and taking responsibility for things we can control and understanding where we are vulnerable. Every discord we build should be built in mind with each and every single user being subject to compromise. Therefore, we have a PLAN in place BEFORE the attack, and do everything we can to mitigate and sometimes null the attack (before it takes place). But there is one role that must NEVER be compromised, and we can lock it down before the discord is open to the public.\n\n## Discord Creator/Founder Role\n\n![The discord creator/founder role is identified by the CROWN.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9pNu0CAI42af7dO2yqzFv.png?height=67&width=284)\n\nThe account that creates the discord should NEVER be an active USER in the server (once it is open) or even active anywhere outside of the server. It is OK if you use an active account to create the discord, but BEFORE going public, this role should be transferred to a burner account (preferably brand new account with email and discord name unassociated with the server/unrecognizable). This account is NOT used for anything else, other than being a ‘hardware wallet/ledger’ for the server. \n \n\n![This role can be transferred to ANYONE, but only by the user with the role. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z-qwDiAGit7tqsl0bucQR.png?height=126&width=184)\n\n \n No matter what the permissions and roles are in a server, no matter the hierarchy of those roles, the **FOUNDER/CREATOR** account bypasses all restrictions and has absolute control over the entire server and every role within it. The good news is, we can completely eliminate this attack vector and keep it in cold storage, unmarked and hidden away on the server. This account doesn’t need any special roles or identifiable markings and we in fact recommend keeping it that way. \n  \n Users may be able to use tools to figure it out, or discord itself may do a poor job of hiding it, but we do NOT need to bring any extra attention to this role, nor do we need to put it at risk by using it on an active account. With the account taken out of play and not in use, there is no chance of anyone phishing or gaining access to this account. Furthermore if an Admin is compromised, we always have one role above it, hidden and ready to ‘break in case of emergency’ and regain control of the server/eradicate the threat. If this role is ever compromised in this way, we know the attack came from within and limit it to only the person who had access to it being responsible.\n\n## Roles, Permissions, & Hierarchy\n\nThe next most vulnerable area of attack is ANYONE with administrator permissions in the server (humans and bots). Administrator permissions bypass ALL roles and restrictions within the discord and channels HOWEVER they still cannot change or alter the roles at or above them. This hierarchy of roles can be used to our advantage when structuring discord roles and permissions.\n\n![Subject to change, missing verification bot.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/F6xf2NACQwCapIOCRrmR6.png?height=674&width=677)\n\nUnderstanding ADMIN access is vulnerable to attack, we place the ONLY human role with admin at the very TOP (+) role and we only grant it to few individuals who need it. I recommend 2-3 at max, depending on the size of the server. I furthermore recommend that those working in this position understand they are NOT allowed to use these accounts to degen into other servers or operate on them for anything else other than doing their administrator work in the discords they are working on. It’s a lot of responsibility, it’s a job and should be treated as such. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TeYlyd392eMzpwYNbSLy-.png?height=246&width=218)\n\n \n Notice this role is neither hoisted, nor visible on the sidebar, nor is it colored and meant to stand out. The vanity roles which mark and signify Admin, Mod, and Team do NOT have Admin access and they are restricted only to the channels they need for their job.  \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_S9lbFudcm3_Jefh3uOHG.gif?height=442&width=536)\n\nThese roles have an identifiable color and mark, sometimes with emoji icons and hoisted above all other roles. We expect these roles to be targeted and plan for them to be compromised. Therefore we plan ahead of time to mitigate the damage anyone can do with these roles with this structure and limitation of perms. Again, the only true Admins of the server have the (+) role and no ONE can give them this role, except for the founder/creator role which is on ice and locked away. And those with this + role take on extra responsibility and limit their attack vectors and exposure. \n  \n After administrator permissions (which again bypasses all restrictions, except hierarchy of roles) the next biggest threat is who has access to INFORMATION channels, with the biggest targets being on #Announcements & #Official Links channels. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jy5bYbeigGGeeMs8WA7bo.png?height=842&width=1013)\n\nThe standard setup takes away everyone’s ability to write in this channel except for the intended user/role which overrides the nulled send message permission. Again Administrators still have absolute access and bypass all restrictions.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ztSxAiQQQn49fEfMnAgYX.png?height=850&width=1006)\n\nTherefore we NEVER grant anyone *permanent* control of these channels and limit their access with the (++) role. Only the true administrator (+) role has permanent access (as admin negates these restrictions) and only the (+) role can grant access.  \n  \n It is therefore recommend that his exchange of power and communication for it be done (off and away from discord). Either through the use of text, whatsapp, or other platforms. This way even if a users discord account is compromised, the attackers do NOT have a means to ask for access to these permissions (other than discord channels and DMs, which we will NEVER use to ask for these permissions).  \n  \n Now attackers need full use to an admins device (phone or computer) to entirely compromise them. These attackers are not doing this yet, but as we up our security they may which means we will need more security and practices outside of discord.\n\n## Trusted Bots\n\nAfter removing the attack vector from the Creator/Founder account, limiting attack vectors to only trusted admin (+) role, our last area of exposure are the bots we use and the permissions we grant them. For projects of larger scale, I highly recommend fully-custom built, in-house bots to limit exposure and responsibility. As much as we dislike Azuki’s founder, I do applaud their server for having no compromises as all their bots are custom built. They remain a high target and have completely avoided compromise, this is worth noting and paying attention to regardless of feelings towards Zagabond or their project. \n  \n Not everyone can afford this option, but for any project that is bringing in hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars, there is no excuse. The only other options are to completely remove all bots from the server (which takes away logs and much welcomed automation), or to have very limited bots in the server strictly permed for their roles, and having the structure setup in a way to prepare for their compromise.\n\n![This build is currently missing a verification gate, I believe I'd place it here - but this is subject to change. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/44gE4YUgygYuvzZohaJEM.png?height=426&width=678)\n\nAs it currently stands I have WICK above all other bots, with the quarantine role above them, but below Wick. This way we can rely on Wick to quarantine and remove all threats (including any of these bots being compromised). The problem with this build is that we are putting A LOT of faith in wick not being compromised. However, Wick is a PAID service and built with security in mind. Even if a user granted themselves a permission in this server, they wouldn’t be able to access and change the wick dashboard settings unless the server owner gave them access (which again, this account is locked away on cold storage).  \n  \n When a Mee6 employee was compromised, and they were able to bypass server settings and change permissions and roles, the one server with Wick operating as intended (PXN) was able to instantly & automatically remove any webhooks and posts in their announcement channel. This was because the user was NOT whitelisted to post on the backend/dashboard of Wick. Even though an admin was compromised, Wick still didn’t allow that admin to post. Again it still puts a lot of faith in Wick and if you operate a large-scale project, I recommend you make your own.\n\n## In Conclusion\n\nServer Creator/Founder should be kept on ice and taken out of play. Humans with Admin access and perms above all other roles should be very limited and ready to take full responsibility and accountability for their role. It should be a paid job and those in that position should understand how to properly build and manage a discord. \n  \n BOTs in the server should be very limited in permissions and channels for only their needed purpose and those that aren’t we should understand fully how much faith and trust we are granting in them (as much as an ADMIN) if they have administrator access. Depending on the size and scale of your business, understand what that means. \n  \n There are discords that have NEVER been compromised, or if compromised, had minimal damage (threats instantly eradicated). We should all understand why that was and open-source our security as much as possible to team up against these threats. Understand this does NOT replace a much needed job and position within this space as we can give someone the keys to a helicopter and they still cannot fly it, or the schematics to a building and not everyone can build it.", "timestamp": 1653253695, "digest": "KYe8hFL2h-zwuDbIMOBxjPSVooAeUkTcWa_UAkhu5aE", "contributor": "0x2f14fBa7f3b90DAA8DE0f35DfE0c6859cBB0034a"}

{"id": "mRlvS8G9_UYEFv3Dasr2NHby87Bb_6NSJDLD7zIZo1U", "title": "Don't step on thunder when buying a car", "body": "Recently, China Insurance Research Institute c-iasi announced the collision test results of seven models: Buick GL8, Tesla Model y, Citroen Tianyi C5, Buick oncoway s, Toyota c-hr, tank 300 and xinxinjun. There are many popular models in the subdivided fields. Today, combined with the test results released this time, assuming that one of them is just covered in your car purchase plan, how to choose?\n\n1、 Buick GL8\n\nOfficial selling price: 2329-533900 yuan\n\nModel overview: Buick GL8 probably didn’t expect that this unique Chinese model can firmly rank first in the current Chinese MPV market (don’t compare Wuling and Chang’an with it, which are not pure MPV models). Some people say that it benefits from its fashionable design and accurate grasp of the Chinese market. These points are true, but if Buick GL8 talks about money and generation, its history is far less than that of Odyssey and Senna.\n\nSuccess is not unreasonable. Friends who have taken Buick GL8 know that its loading capacity is still very strong. It can be said that it perfectly deduces the space performance of an MPV. In the most worrying third row space, GL8 can also be easily handled. When used, the trunk space can still accommodate three boarding boxes of about 20 inches. Because of its strong space performance, GL8 has today’s position in the market.\n\nHowever, only space is obviously not enough. In recent years, Buick GL8 began to make a big fuss at the luxury level, and the car series is also divided into ordinary version and luxury Avenir Avia version. The whole system is equipped with 2.0T engine. In this way, Buick GL8 has maintained a good sales volume with complete lining and face. Looking at all the competitors, even if the powers are around, it will stand firm.\n\nIn terms of safety, Buick GL8 also participated in the crash test of China Insurance Research Institute before, but its performance was not ideal in the earlier test. There was also a bending of A-pillar. This collision is the medium-term modified model of GL8. From the test results, it can be seen that the medium-term modified GL8 has a commission in all aspects of safety performance, especially in the 25% offset collision, from the previous P (poor) to a (good), The roof strength has also been improved from a (good) to G (excellent).\n\nAfter the mid-term modification of GL8, the A-pillar was slightly deformed in the 25% offset collision, which was much better than that of the old model. The GL8 in the side impact has also lost serious points before, and has also been improved on the new models. On the whole, although the overall performance of the medium-term modified GL8 has not reached the optimal state, considering the adverse factors in its MPV structure, the progress in security of the medium-term modified GL8 is still worthy of recognition. However, it can be further strengthened in terms of body materials.\n\n2、 Buick oncoway\n\nOfficial selling price: 209900-309900 yuan\n\nIf you were asked to buy an SUV within the price range of 200000 yuan, would you include Buick ankovi in the alternative list? It is estimated that many consumers are unlikely to choose it. In this price range, there are countless domestic SUVs, which have made great efforts in terms of space, power and configuration. But the test still needs to be tested. Whether it sells well or not is put aside. First of all, the car must be OK.\n\nSimilarly, playing back the old Buick oncoway model, there was no small controversy in the first phase of the test of China Insurance Research Institute, because oncoway is a model produced in China and then sold back to the U.S. market. It can be said that the Chinese Standard Version of the old oncoway and the returned models have achieved very different results in the test of China Insurance Research Institute and the IIHS crash test in the United States. Especially in the rigid performance of the roof, there are great differences between the two. The medium gauge version is very “straddling”.\n\nUp to now, China Insurance Research Institute has tested Buick ankway s model again. We see that it has achieved g excellence in the passenger safety index in the vehicle, 25% offset collision on the driver’s side is also g excellence, and the roof strength and side collision are also g excellence. Similarly, the pedestrian safety index and pedestrian protection outside the vehicle are also excellent. “Don’t steam steamed bread, fight for breath”. This time, Buick ankoway finally found a trace of face.\n\nHowever, in terms of crashworthiness and maintenance economy, ankoway received a poor evaluation of P. Get m general evaluation on vehicle auxiliary safety. In that sentence, combined with its price, in terms of safety assistance, leonkovic’s performance is far from reaching the standard of domestic cars of the same level.\n\nBut anyway, a strong body should come first. This is the foundation, but at the same time, we can’t ignore the balanced performance of some safety auxiliary configurations. We hope that oncoway will continue to maintain excellent achievements in future collisions and see more progress at the same time.\n\n3、 Citroen Tianyi C5 Aircross\n\nOfficial selling price: RMB 159700-229700\n\nLooking at the selling price of Citroen Tianyi C5 Aircross, it will undoubtedly be more people-friendly and grounded. From the side, it also truly reflects the dilemma of Citroen models in the domestic market. In fact, in this test, I would like to see the performance of Versailles c5x, but this time, China Insurance and Research Institute chose Citroen Tianyi C5 Aircross as the player, which is also worthy of attention.\n\nBut unexpectedly, the Citroen C5 Aircross Tianyi, as the representative of the legal system car, did not achieve excellent results. Look at its test results:\n\nFirstly, in the 25% offset collision, it is a (good), and the A-pillar has a certain bending; To tell you the truth, it’s a little out of line with the consistent performance of legal cars. It’s very unexpected. Second, the front side air curtain of the vehicle is not large enough, and the score of side impact is a. the air curtain blocks the dummy’s head between the air curtain and the window. If there is a traffic accident, it will be extremely dangerous. I don’t know whether it is a design problem or a sudden case.\n\nThird, in the roof strength test, the peak load of Citroen Tianyi was only 53954 n, which did not meet the excellent standard of four times the vehicle weight.\n\nAfter watching the performance of Tianyi, the author was also surprised. We should know that Tianyi C5 Aircross is a global model of Citroen. In the previous Euro NCAP test collision, it received a 5-star evaluation. In the official publicity, it is clearly pointed out that", "timestamp": 1653258669, "digest": "gX5miCZTOE4r_4qfIXV58czNvien4UII9Q5e9TrW0CM", "contributor": "0xed871cB9957f3820D40a8972664fFdfBCA51ABCa"}

On May 20, the S\\&P 500 briefly fell into bear market territory, indicating that traders continue to sell risky assets in fear of a recession. \n\nDue to its tight correlation with US equities markets, Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) has remained under pressure for many weeks. The bulls are attempting to push Bitcoin [higher during the weekend](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-targets-record-8th-weekly-red-candle-while-btc-price-limits-weekend-losses) and avert an even longer losing streak.\n\n![](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2022-05/f002ea05-8f8a-4299-9a96-07d8c679310c.png)\n\n*Crypto market data daily view. Source:** *[*Coin360*](https://coin360.com/)\n\nBitcoin’s performance in the first five months has been the worst since 2018, indicating that sellers are in control. However, after several weeks of weakness, the crypto markets may be on the cusp of a [bear market rally](https://cointelegraph.com/trading-for-beginners/bull-vs-bear-crypto-market-what-is-the-difference-and-how-to-handle-both).\n\nWhat are the critical levels that may signal the start of a sustained recovery? Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the near term.\n\n## BTC/USDT\n\nBitcoin rebounded off the crucial support at $28,630 on May 20, indicating strong buying near this level. The bulls are attempting to push the price above the downtrend line, which could be the first indication that the selling pressure may be reducing.\n\n![](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2022-05/34a8a16e-b22f-4cbc-8cb4-38f836814546.png)\n\n*BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView*\n\nAbove the downtrend line, the BTC/USDT pair could rise to the 20-day exponential moving average ($31,887). The bears are likely to defend this level with vigor. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will once again try to sink the pair below $28,630.\n\nIf they manage to do that, the pair could drop to $26,700. This is an important level to keep an eye on because a break and close below it could open the doors for a decline to $25,000 and then to $21,800.\n\nConversely, if buyers thrust the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could attempt a rally to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $34,823. If this level is scaled, the pair could climb to the 50-day simple moving average ($37,289).\n\n![](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2022-05/798c16b5-94df-4242-92eb-b33b10b4ff5f.png)\n\n*BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView*\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the price is getting squeezed between the downtrend line and $28,630. The 20-EMA and the 50-SMA have flattened out and the relative strength index (RSI) is just above the midpoint suggesting a balance between supply and demand.\n\nThis balance could tilt in favor of buyers if they push and sustain the price above the downtrend line. If that happens, the pair could start its northward march toward the 200-SMA.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from the current level, the bears will attempt to sink the pair below $28,630 and gain the upper hand.\n\n## BNB/USDT\n\nBinance Coin ([BNB](https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index)) recovered sharply from the critical support at $211 and has reached the overhead resistance at the 20-day EMA ($323). This is an important level for the bears to defend because a break and close above it could indicate that a bottom may be in place.\n\n![](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2022-05/4076e671-1621-4b7c-a706-e682aee9fa2a.png)\n\n*BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView*\n\nAbove the 20-day EMA, the BNB/USDT pair could rally to $350 and thereafter to the 50-day SMA ($376). This level could again act as a stiff hurdle but if bulls thrust the price above it, the pair could rally to the 200-day SMA ($451).\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears have not yet given up and they continue to sell at higher levels.

Systems integration and controlled environments are used to make the most efficient use of space and resources.  \n\nThese methods are not only capable of producing large quantities of food, but also of doing so in a way that is gentle on the environment. As vertical farming becomes more widespread, it has the potential to transform the way we think about food production. \n\nOne key advantage of vertical farming is that it is much more efficient than traditional farming methods. \n\nFor example, vertical farms can use up to 95% less water than traditional farms, and they can be located near urban areas, which reduces transportation costs. In addition, vertical farms can be operated year-round, meaning that there is no need for seasonal breaks. \n\nAs a result, vertical farming is a much more efficient way of producing food. In addition to being efficient, vertical farming is also sustainable. Because vertical farms use less water and land, they have a smaller environmental footprint than traditional farms.\n\nIn addition, Vertical farms can use recycled materials for things like walls and ceilings, further reducing their environmental impact. As more people become aware of the benefits of vertical farming, it is likely that this method of agriculture will become increasingly. \n\nIt's no secret that the quality of our food has been declining in recent years. But what is the cause of this decline? One major factor is the way that our food is produced. \n\nIn order to maximize profits, many farmers and food producers have turned to mass production methods that sacrifice quality for quantity. This has led to a diminished nutrient content in our fruits and vegetables. As a result, we are not getting the we need to stay healthy.\n\n The three most popular methods for growing plants without soil are aquaponics, hydroponics and aeroponics. All of these techniques can often result in bigger and healthier crops than traditional plant-growing methods that rely on topsoil rich with nutrients. \n\nBut what if there was a way to combine the best of all worlds? That's where solar panels come in. Solar panels can be used to power hydroponic, aquaponic, and aeroponic systems, making them more efficient and effective. \n\nNot only that, but the system can also help to regulate temperature and humidity levels, providing the perfect environment for plant growth. \n\nBy integrating the growing system, you can increase yields, reduce costs, and create a more sustainable and eco-friendly operation.", "timestamp": 1653260347, "digest": "ySbF7egGqe5H7mr7_EFkqvbOjwinbrSHRnVhdBl0c8I", "contributor": "0xC38A688a3c8111B174aaa30c6576da598Dd74cCF"}

In addition, we can help to reduce the carbon footprint of the food production process by using less land and water.\n\nA decentralized food supply chain is one in which food production, processing, distribution, and consumer purchases are integrated and coordinated within a relatively short distance.\n\nThe decentralized food supply system is an alternative to the industrial food system, which is reliant on large-scale monocrop production, long-distance transport, and global trade.\n\nA decentralized system is often more efficient and higher quality than an industrialized one. Modular technology can help small scale producers to grow more food and produce more food with less effort.\n\nWith patented protection over corporate influence and a dedication to the creative commons for we will scale the development our technology so producers can easily setup integrated solutions, products, and services to participate toward decentralization.\n\nThis will result in more people having access to fresh, healthy food. It will also reduce the environmental impact of the food system by minimizing transportation distances and energy use.\n\nOver the last century, there have been significant advances in our understanding of plant genetics and how plants develop.\n\nThis has allowed us to create new plant varieties that are more resistant to disease and pests, and that can grow in a wider range of environmental conditions. However, much of this research has been focused on individual genes and on making small changes to the plant's DNA.\n\nThis approach has its limits, as it is difficult to predict how a plant will respond to a change in its environment. A more promising approach is to create controlled environments in which plants can be grown under specific conditions.\n\nThe study of plant development and evolution in a controlled setting, and to identify plant plant growth patterns and their best suited particular environment.\n\nThis systems approach also gives the opportunity to stabilize or amplify the existing conditions in a local environment, which can help to improve plant productivity in marginal areas.\n\nEnvironmental sensors are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and their use is providing researchers with a greater understanding of plant development and evolution.\n\nBy tracking the environmental conditions under which plants grow, sensors can help to identify the plant varieties that are best suited for a particular environment.\n\nIn addition, sensors can be used to monitor the progress of plant growth, and to track the movement of pollen and other plant materials. This information can then be used to develop new methods of crop production, and to identify potential problems with existing crops.\n\nAs sensors become more affordable and easier to use, they are likely to play an increasingly important role in the study of plant development and evolution.\n\nThe vertical farm is a type of agricultural facility that produces crops in vertically stacked layers. Sensor systems integrated into the framework of the vertical farm offer potential to generate valuable data about plant development under controlled environmental conditions.\n\nThese sensor systems can measure factors such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, and carbon dioxide levels. Measuring environmental factors will likely play an increasingly important role in the study of plant development and evolution.\n\nIn addition, sensor data can be used to optimize growing conditions for specific crops, resulting in higher yields and better quality produce. The integrated sensor system have the potential to revolutionize agriculture by making it more efficient, productive, and sustainable.\n\nA vertical farm is a type of agriculture where crops are grown in vertically stacked layers in a controlled environment.Vertical farms can be used to grow a variety of crops, including fruits, vegetables, and grains.\n\nOne major benefit of vertical farming is that it allows farmers to grow crops year-round, regardless of the weather outside. Additionally, because vertical farms are typically located in urban areas, they can help to reduce the amount of land needed for agriculture.\n\nVertical farms also use less water than traditional farms, and they can minimize the spread of pests and diseases. As a result, vertical farming is an increasingly popular option for those looking to produce food in a more sustainable way.\n\nIntegrated sensor systems offer the potential to generate valuable data about plant development by measuring a variety of environmental factors.\n\nSensors can measure light levels, soil moisture, and temperature. This data can be used to track the progress of a plant's growth, identify stressors that may be affecting its development, and predict future yield.\n\nIn addition, sensor systems can be used to monitor the health of a crop by detecting early signs of disease or pests. By providing detailed information about plant development, integrated sensor systems have the potential to revolutionize agriculture.\n\nIn order to optimize growing conditions for specific crops, it is necessary to collect data about the conditions under which the crop grows best.\n\nThis data can be collected through studies of the crop's natural habitat, experiments with different growing conditions, and surveys of farmers who have experience growing the crop. Once this data is collected, it can be analyzed to identify patterns and trends.\n\nThis analysis can then be used to develop models that predict how the crop will respond to different conditions. These models can be used to optimize the growing environment for the crop, thereby increasing yield and quality.\n\nIn order to ensure that the data is of high quality, it is important to use reliable sources and methods of collection and analysis. Using data and statistics to optimize growing conditions can be an effective way to increase crop yields and improve quality.\n\nThe vertical farm is a type of agriculture that is increasingly being adopted by farmers due to its many potential benefits.\n\nOne key advantage of the vertical farm is the integrated sensor system. This system monitors various parameters such as temperature, humidity, and light intensity. By doing so, it allows for greater control over the growing environment.\n\nAs a result, the plants can be grown more efficiently, with less water and fewer pesticides. In addition, the sensor system can also help to reduce food waste by alerting farmers when the produce is ready to harvest.\n\nOverall, the integrated sensor system of the vertical farm offers a number of potential benefits that make it an attractive option for agricultural production.\n\nWhile vertical growing technology and vertical farming offer a number of potential benefits, there are also a number of challenges that need to be addressed in order to realize these benefits. One challenge is the high initial investment cost.\n\nVertical farms require specialized equipment and infrastructure, which can be expensive. Additionally, vertical farms often require higher levels of energy and water consumption than traditional farming methods.\n\nUsing a specialized infrastructure we can find ways to build the tools required to scale outcomes of the innovation and technology in action. The current infrastructure is not equipped to handle the demand for these services.\n\nThe need for these specialized services has become more apparent as the use of technology in our everyday lives has increased. With the right tools in place, we can overcome these challenges and continue to innovate and improve the way we live and work.\n\nAs such, it is important to ensure that vertical farms are designed and operated in an efficient manner in order to minimize these costs. As vertical farming continues to grow in popularity, it is important to ensure that these farms are designed and operated in a way that minimizes costs.\n\nOne way to do this is by using efficient growing methods, such as hydroponics. In addition, it is important to use energy-efficient lighting and climate control systems.Another challenge is the lack of standards and regulations for vertical farming.\n\nThis lack of regulation can lead to a wide range of practices being used, which can make it difficult to compare the costs and benefits of different farms.\n\nAs vertical farms continue to grow in popularity, there is an increasing amount of public pressure on influencers to push for solutions that will lead to change in regulation.\n\nThis can often lead to a wide range of practices being used the key factors include the type of crops grown, the climatic conditions of the farm, the level of automation, and the size of the farm.\n\nAs vertical farming becomes more widespread, it is important to develop standards and regulations that will help to ensure that these farms are operated efficiently and in a way that minimizes costs.\n\nAs vertical farming is still a relatively new technology, there are no standardized methods or regulations governing its use.\n\nThis lack of standards can make it difficult for farmers to compare different types of vertical farms and choose the most appropriate option for their needs.\n\nFinally, vertical farms can generate a significant efficiency, which needs to be properly managed and utilized to offer the potential benefits.
