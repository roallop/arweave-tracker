Now they are the primary source of revenue for the most successful products in the fastest growing media category.\n\n10/ Now to the main topic. The internet pioneer John Gilmore famously said that the internet treats censorship as a defect and routes around it. The internet does the same thing to bad business models.\n\n11/ A classic example is open source vs proprietary software in the 90s/00s. Proprietary software vendors stuck to dated, closed source models despite strong opposition. Grassroots open source communities routed around them with entirely new software stacks.\n\n12/ NFTs are an important recent example of the internet routing around broken business models. Like open source, NFTs are a grassroots movement, led by creators extending the video game virtual goods model to their own fields.\n\n13/ Even if publishers and studios, along with web 2 incumbents, resist the new model, individual creators can route around them, going direct to their fans.\n\n14/ A musician can now choose to give away new music to maximize distribution and charge for scarce complementary NFTs like digital album art, behind-the-scenes passes, and proof of fandom. The musician 3LAU made $11.6M with a recent NFT drop. [https://nft.3lau.com](https://t.co/gMfFgJ3v6S?amp=1)\n\n15/ A filmmaker or writer can sell NFTs to crowdfund their creations instead of pitching traditional financing sources. Recently, a novelist raised $50K this way [https://emily.mirror.xyz](https://t.co/LCbDu7Eb8c?amp=1) and a documentary film raised $2M [https://ethereumfilm.mirror.xyz](https://t.co/HzTKmq4LpJ?amp=1)\n\n16/ There is nothing magical about video games that makes them more monetizable than other forms of media. People love video games, but people also love music, books, films, podcasts, and digital art.\n\n17/ Creators can now choose to route around institutions that have been holding them back, embracing the forward progression of technology — as video games did— instead of fighting it — as the music industry did.", "timestamp": 1632670663, "digest": "PYk1fhNK4bBIDLPVpEJVUPprlOEUvf30XMDNLGZPY38", "contributor": "0xe11BFCBDd43745d4Aa6f4f18E24aD24f4623af04"}

I wrote stories, I printed huge banners on dot matrix printers, I made pixelated turtles draw faces. I felt like I was conjuring artifacts out of the ether. It felt akin to watching my dad and his friends, accomplished timber framers, turn trees into homes. I was 10 years old, and was able to make thoughts appear on screen and dance around. It was magic.\n\n*\\[I won't even get started on what it was like when we got our first Mac, and how it democratized typography, desktop publishing, and drawing tools overnight. Without a bit of hyperbole, I will credit the Steves Jobs and Wozniak with creating the tools that have provided me with a design career, and contributed to my design obsession, but that’s another post.\\]*\n\n### And then we got a modem.\n\nWhen I first got to use our home phone to turn sounds into data, a world of other people’s computers came rushing into our house. BBS', IRC, Usenet, file trading, txt files as welcome mats and manifestos. We were *connecting* with each other. After years spent in our own basements, we were all in each other’s basement.\n\nAnd when the multimedia World Wide Web came along not too long after, pairing visual experiences and information with all of that connectivity, I was hooked. It was like an encyclopedia had come alive, and I could follow any rathole I wished. For a kid from a very small town in rural Michigan, it was revelatory.\n\nMy career aspirations shifted quickly as the web took hold; from aspiring architect to designer/programmer and photographer (which became my other obsession, tickling a lot of the same right brain/left brain notions of technology and art), and I spent all of my time making web pages to publish my designs, my thoughts, my photography, and finding community in those pursuits. I managed to make a career from those digital incantations that had only been a hobby, and that felt great. It was a world of *enthusiasts*. I was too young for the first round of computer clubs in the 70s, when people would get together to geek out over everything they were discovering was possible, but I think the early web felt similar. There was enthusiasm again.\n\nAnd while the web has since become the greatest platform for business that the world as ever seen, it's also managed to start feeling stale. Where \"Web 1\" was an enthusiastic DIYers dream, Web 2 quickly went from a place where we could all build a media rich and own-able online presence to a place where our online presence was owned by the biggest businesses we’ve ever seen. Platforms became walled gardens, and algorithms replaced curation. It got lame. It became a world of templates and repetition, and privacy settings we all knew were lip service.\n\n### web3\n\nBut something has come along in the last few years that *feels* like those early days, and fits right into that technology-and-culture combination that feels worth of upping the version number. Web 3.0. The new element in this version is that value/money/commerce and *ownership* is fused right in, rather than something to be built on top or provided by someone else. People are building things that have values to others, and they are building a living for themselves while they do it. The wallet gardens will lose their power, as the things we make can belong to us, whichever garden we choose to spend our day in. The enthusiasm is back, and while it may be weird to some, as fervency often can be, it's making the internet and technology and media and arts else *fun again*.\n\nIt's the wild west right now, and I'm still wrapping my head around it, but consider me a web enthusiast again.", "timestamp": 1632671128, "digest": "sYBhK9lem8IUz3Kro4YcVfMZB9C-ymD4WKX-8Bqhyg4", "contributor": "0x9E24184F3428B6B58eB9cd3344e075Ea6cde3747"}
