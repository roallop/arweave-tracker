They transcend platforms, geographic locations, and language. NFTs are slowly becoming the economic infrastructure behind the internet's content and creators. Recent demand for meme NFTs has proven memes are more valuable when minted as NFTs. Here we explore minting memes as NFTs, arguing that soon most memes will be minted as NFTs due to advantages in monetization, provenance, attribution, and platform-agnosticism. \n\nWe define *meme* in this piece not by its broad definition as \"a passing element of a culture or system of behavior\" but by its media-focused definition of \"a humorous image, video, piece of text, etc., that is copied (often with slight variations) and spread rapidly by internet users.\" This makes the argument easier to comprehend, though many of the fundamentals argued in this piece may apply to memes more broadly.\n\n## First Classic Memes, then Fresh Memes\n\nMost memes that have recently auctioned as NFTs have been mostly pre-existing memes, meaning they were initially created off-chain and have been circulating the internet pre-minting. Some examples of pre-existing memes minted as NFTs are Doge, Nyan Cat, Disaster Girl, Bad Luck Brian, and more by the day. \n\n[Memes turned NFTs | Yupcollections](https://app.yup.io/collections/memes-turned-nfts/CguHLel)\n\nThe minting of classic memes as NFTs serves as a precursor for genuine 'fresh memes' that originate as NFTs. As sales for meme NFTs exploded, meme lords and comedians have begun creating memes directly as NFTs on NFT platforms. See below a hilarious meme by comedian/artist SlyFly. \n\n[NFT Not Dead | Foundation](https://foundation.app/@slyflynft/nft-not-dead-45350)\n\nAll memes should be minted as NFTs whether or not people are planning to sell them, profit from them, or believe their price will increase over time. This will enable the birth of the Meme Economy. \n\n[https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1370373708506750977?s=20](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1370373708506750977?s=20)\n\n### Provenance - \"Proof-of-First\"\n\nNFTs are platform-agnostic, which means they can exist in various platforms while retaining uniqueness and authenticity. For example, as the graphic highlights below, the Nyan Cat NFT is showcased and displayed on various marketplaces and platforms. The famous meme GIF is linked to the address of the NFT so when someone shares the original NFT in their article, they can pull the on-chain address. This is powerful for memes because it allows them to maintain attribution and context in every platform. So any action on a meme NFT is accessible, readable, and usable in almost all platforms. Every bid, swap, and transaction is added to the metadata of that specific NFT.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/951f5a64-ff12-4881-a4fb-d6504f4995fe.jpeg?height=838&width=1630)\n\nAs Web3 social continues to evolve, the engagement data associated with an NFT also becomes platform agnostic. With [Yup](http://yup.io), for example, the likes and comments given across the web are tied directly to an NFT. This is quite different than web2 social. For example, if a meme is shared on both FB and Twitter, there's no relationship between those two memes so hard to attribute the relationship between the two. Platforms can be scraped and AI can identify memes, but the data gathered on each platform is siloed.\n\n**Why would someone attribute correctly?** \n\n1. Platform restrictions\n    1. can be done in centralized way or decentralized. \n2. For exposure\n3. Composability\n4. Social norms\n\nThe platform-agnostic features of NFTs, the immutability of the blockchain, and decentralized governance make for a perfect recipe of provenance and economic incentives.\n\n[https://twitter.com/naval/status/1378955787171602432?s=20](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1378955787171602432?s=20)\n\n### Layered Splits\n\nSplits were pioneered by Mirror, but more recently we've witnessed Foundation use them for NFTs. Turn their memes to NFTs when they're using someone else's memes as a template. Ex: Doge meme, photo of the dog, if you use that, you make it like your original meme even though someone else is using it.\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0cf67d-819e-4a83-aac5-205b72a044a2.jpeg?height=838&width=1630)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac729cb6-15f4-4584-a75b-7df5fd6ad063.jpeg?height=838&width=1252)\n\n\n\nA great example is async.art - an NFT platform for programable media, using layers as assets, allowing users to use them in powerful ways. When the market is high or low, people create angry memes or happy memes. Cool stuff like that. Situations like that can expand to memes very quickly.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/99695862-cf4f-4bc1-bad5-315f0ea15377.jpeg?height=768&width=1024)\n\n\n\nRight now, some may argue that it is ridiculous that every meme is a NFT for the following reasons. Users will mint images that they don't own -- there are no rights and copyright for commercial use but they are getting rewarded for it. Others may suggest that people won't mint memes of NFTs because it is expensive. But seeing improvements in layer 1 and layer 2, it's becoming cheaper and cheaper to mint any graphics as an NFT\n\nWhat we expect to see next is price of NFTs will drop to a cent or less than a cent. Once it's cheap enough to casually mint NFTs, people will. This gives meme NFTs an additional utility as building blocks for other NFTs. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo conclude, as it becomes easier and cheaper to mint NFTs, users can retain ownership and buyers can speculate and commemorate the NFTs moving forward.\n\nAllow multilayered memes so that users can use existing memes or own memes while maintain attributions and royalties. Once we have that infrastructure in place, one can make a meme from other memes and the metadata becomes platform agnostic. The economics play out in such a manner that users are incentivized for using their own memes. Incentivize the norms and using the memes the that they use which will make people use more memes. To be able to build more value around in meme creation in a very clean and transparent marketplace. Incentivize creators to make more memes. \n\nLastly, this will also incentivize creators to curate valuable memes in the context of their own platforms and across the web in order to participate in the reward association. Ultimately, it is a win win, for curators, platforms and fans that allow memes to evolve to a fully functioning economy.\n\nhttps://app.yup.io/collections/nfts-%26-the-meme-economy/5iVSY6U", "timestamp": 1625702168, "digest": "bDMST-9H2_2pXLHkO8b_1mCargJk56BGGFXEKBQtL8I", "contributor": "0x4303Ddc9943D862f2B205aF468a4A786c5137E76"}

Because the old models of fundraising are lacking. Traditionally, crowdfunding campaigns are the only way young artists like us can bring our visions to life. Art is essential: bringing people meaning, comfort, and community. But with the current infrastructure, art can be really difficult to make and share with the world: we’re often forced to put a lot of our own money, hard work and time into projects without compensation. Often, we have to sign away ownership of our creative vision to companies that hold our art and our creative rights hostage. It goes both ways, too: fans are just fans, and donors don’t get much in return for their financial contribution.\n\n[Dog Lover](crowdfund://0x7265b48eBF05d83bfB97C5fc341E4eBBFd1b53C0?version=tiered_1&network=rinkeby&features=overview)\n\nWith this experiment in a crypto-funded model of filmmaking, we want to pave the way for change. We want models of direct ownership of art: a future where there is a real connection between artists and their fans. We want you to have a stake in The Dog Lover. We want supporters who aren’t just supporters, but collaborators. By participating, you’re co-creating that future with us. You’re coming on to our creative team and gaining a behind-the-scenes look into what it takes to make films happen. Together with you, we will take The Dog Lover to through the festival circuit, where we anticipate it being a major contender.\n\nSupporters of The Dog Lover will be innovators: no other short films have been created this way in cinema history!\n\n### WHAT’S THE DOG LOVER ABOUT?\nHow far would you go to be loved? What personal price would you pay? Would you change yourself into someone — or something — other than who you are?\n\nThese are the questions The Dog Lover asks, and that our main character, Walter, must answer.\n\nWhen Walter’s wife’s beloved dog Max dies, her grief is crushing. Walter works hard to fill the aching void in her heart, but nothing seems to please her. Walter soon discovers that he can win Sarah’s love by acting like her dog.\n\nIt isn’t long before the couple begins to rekindle their romance through these strange circumstances. Things are looking up, until Walter realizes that this particular pathway to love is paved with all sorts of bizarre pitfalls. A little too bizarre, perhaps. It soon becomes clear to Walter that he must choose whether he’s willing to be his wife’s dog.\n\nThe Dog Lover is a weird, offbeat story with elements of dark comedy and horror. But it also has an emotional core that is deeply relatable: at one point or another, we’ve all had to decide if we’re going to be someone’s dog (so to speak) or risk loneliness. Needless to say, we don’t always make the right decision.\n\nCheck out the trailer below, cut from footage from the original short we made together during our first year at the American Film Institute Conservatory (the number one film school in the US according to the Hollywood Reporter). With this new version, we’re going to expand and perfect the story and utilize the skills we developed during our time at AFI.\n\nTRAILER\n\n## MEET THE TEAM\n\n### DIRECTOR\n**ANNE-SOPHIE BINE**\nOf French and Polish background, Anne-Sophie Bine was raised in several different countries — which may be why she speaks five languages.

We are overwhelmed by the support for this [experiment](https://twitter.com/forefront__/status/1412056876787724291) in funding high quality public content. Thank you to all who have contributed by collecting the NFT. This essay is now permanently available to the public.*\n\n***\n\n*This is a guest post featuring [Austin Robey](https://twitter.com/austinrobey_), co-founder at [Ampled](https://twitter.com/ampl3d) in an FF exclusive.*\n\n\"The Ownership Economy\" is an idea coined by [Variant Fund](https://variant.fund/) investor Jesse Walden to describe emergent ways that crypto networks can be built, owned, and controlled by their users. It’s an outline for exciting new economic models that give networks the ability to create a more cooperative and equitable online economy. It’s also a counter-movement to extractive, proprietary, investor-owned platforms whose ownership structures create competing interests between their investors and their communities. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/88bea002-c2b4-468f-8ddf-dc69c35b0079.png?height=1114&width=1980)\n\nJesse describes the ownership economy like this:\n\n> The ownership economy doesn’t always mean a literal distribution of tokens, stock options, or equity. It also doesn’t necessarily mean that an application or service is entirely built on a blockchain. Rather, it means that ownership — which may manifest in the form of novel economic rewards, platform governance, or new forms of social capital — can be a new keystone of user experiences, with plenty of design space to explore.\n\nAs a counter-framework against web 2.0 pitfalls, \"The Ownership Economy\" outlines how users can gain real power in emergent decentralized networks. Although \"The Ownership Economy\" represents a trend towards the creation of a more equitable online economy, words are important – and there is a risk that the word “ownership” may be misleading. \n\nTo start, there doesn’t seem to be a consensus about what \"ownership\" is.\n\n- Is ownership a metaphor for more agency? \n- Is ownership a way to share “exposure to upside”?\n- Is ownership a robust set of clear rights and responsibilities?\n\nCommunity ownership is a virtuous aspiration among web3 organizations. However, without an agreed upon definition or collective understanding of what ownership actually is, we may inadvertently dilute or abstract its meaning.\n\n### Risks of misinterpreting ownership \nIn the late aughts, there was a sense of optimism in tech, and a sentiment that tech-enabled web 2.0 platforms were \"democratizing\" things for everyday people. However, this idea of democratization never showed up where it mattered: in the boardroom and in corporate governance. Platforms were, by default, oligarchies controlled by founders or investors. Instead, what \"democracy\" really meant for common users was \"access\". We got access to things like image sharing, tweets, crowdfunding, information, and more. As users, we never got a seat at the table, or a say in how these platforms were run. At the same time, value from our user-generated data, art, content, and labor was extracted to enrich founders and investors.\n\nWeb 3.0 usage of the word \"ownership\" carries similar risks to the web 2.0 usage of the word \"democracy\". \n\nWhereas \"democracy\" was redefined to mean \"access\", \"ownership\" risks being abstracted away to mean little more than \"exposure to upside\". Yes, having the ability for users to capture more value is good, but does it qualify as \"ownership\"?\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/austinrobey_/status/1366237014841053185)\n\n### Why ownership is important\nConcentrated ownership is one the primary drivers of wealth inequality today. In tech, the ownership gap between platform owners and platform users continues to grow – and has real consequences. \n\n[If Apple were structured as a worker-owned cooperative](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cameronkeng/2014/12/18/if-apple-was-a-worker-cooperative-each-employee-would-earn-at-least-403k/), the ownership stake of each of its 150,000 workers would be worth over $15m. On top of that, each employee would receive an annual dividend of over $400k. Ownership creates wealth, and its concentration helps create wealth inequality.\n\nWhile musicians faced an existential crisis during a pandemic, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek’s ownership stake in Spotify climbed to be worth over $4 billion. In order to earn $4 billion, a musician earning the median wage of $25,000 would have to work for 160,000 years – in other words, they’d have to have started working before human history began.\n\nYancey Strickler, Co-founder of Kickstarter, writes about concentrated ownership in his essay, [\"The Ownership Crisis\"](https://ystrickler.medium.com/the-ownership-crisis-55a5f84c3e88).\n\n> *Despite many people contributing to the tools and services that now dominate our lives, most people have no stake in them. To cite just one example, the four million people who drive for Uber probably own less of the company combined than a single dentist in New Jersey with Vanguard in their portfolio.*\n\n> *People with ownership — virtually all of whom are already wealthy — will become increasingly wealthier. People without ownership — everyone else — will become increasingly not. Soon it will be hard to see anything else.*\n\nShared ownership models will become a critical cornerstone for building a fairer and equitable online economy. In tech, we should not only work to create greater access to ownership, but also reinforce a definition of ownership that is ambitious and capable of delivering meaningful systems change. \n\n### What is ownership?\nOwnership can be understood as a proxy for two things: decision making power and financial power. This suite of benefits includes the ability to have a voice in the direction, strategy, operations, or fate of a company; as well as the ability to capture profits and the value of its equity and assets.\n\n*Ownership = (Financial power + Decision making power)*\n\nBoth financial power and decision making power are elements of ownership that can be broken down into sets of distinct rights and responsibilities, often on a spectrum.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0d8968ff-9036-451e-880a-71b22acf2950.jpg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nLooking at the current web 3.0 landscape through this lens, we can examine the ways that organizations within \"The Ownership Economy\" can improve.\n\n### Financial Power: Transparent Investments & Agreements \n\nOne of the most overlooked elements of ownership in the web 3.0 space is financial transparency, particularly regarding investments and agreements. As an example, investment announcements ([like this](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zora-gets-nft-funding-craze-212329286.html)) may share that an investment was made, but won’t openly share what investors actually purchased. If the goal of a crypto network is to become \"community owned\", it would seem logical to disclose investment deal structures and details to their community. \n\nConsider a real-world example: Imagine you are a part owner of a bakery. Next, imagine there is another owner who has entered into financial agreements with third parties, but you are not allowed to access the terms. Would this arrangement seem like true ownership?\n\nIf a crypto network is raising money from investors, demonstrating a reasonable level of transparency is an easy thing to do. All it would take is a blog post. For example, an announcement could say something like: \n\n> \"We raised x amount of money to do x. The deal was structured like this because our goal of community ownership is ____. Here's what it means for the larger ecosystem.\" \n\nIf the goal of \"progressive decentralization\" is to transition to community ownership, it would seem incongruent for early stage investments terms to be hidden from the community. In addition, opaque investment terms imply the community wasn’t given a chance to participate in the investment process.\n\nSome questions to consider:\n\n- What are investors purchasing with their investment?\n- How does this impact the path towards community ownership?\n- Why not share investment deal terms with the community?\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/austinrobey_/status/1399365878718910469)\n\n### Financial Power: Transparent Compensation\n\nOften in the web 3.0 space, there is an analogous comparison given to digital cooperatives. While many DAOs do disclose compensation for full time workers, existing cooperatives are much better than crypto networks at sharing these details. As an example, look at this publicly available [Executive Compensation Report](https://www.rei.com/about-rei/executive-compensation) by REI Co-op. Disclosures of compensation within crypto networks should become a core standard in order to demonstrate real community ownership.\n\n- How are founders and executives getting paid?\n- What is the compensation package and structure?\n- How are \"advisors\" compensated?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/78003790-a571-4dcc-a6b1-697d808027d5.jpg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\n### Decision Making Power: Treasury & Board Codetermination\n\nIn corporate governance, \"codetermination\" refers to workers or other stakeholders having representatives on the board of directors. It’s a step towards collective governance that any company can take to create a more democratic workplace. \n\nFor networks that aim to be community owned, there should be some form of codetermination at the outset, allowing community proxies or representatives to be involved in treasury-related decisions -- particularly around token allocation.\n\nSome questions to consider:\n\n- Who decides how tokens are allocated?\n- Who controls access to the treasury?\n- If tokens = ownership, who makes decisions around distributing ownership?\n\n### Strengthening community ownership: community investments\n\nBy default, platforms today are owned by founders and investors, not communities. If the goal for networks is to be community owned, then there is a tacit implication (even by VCs investing in the \"ownership economy\") that community ownership is preferable to investor ownership.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e8e5c05b-d0bf-47dd-b60c-b2ac36c3db7a.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nThis is the primary defining characteristic of a community-owned platform: less investor ownership. In order for communities to achieve greater ownership, investors need to own less. In order for communities to have greater financial power, investors must have less. In order for communities to have greater decision making power, investors must have less.\n\nTo create stronger community ownership, web 3.0 networks should move away from resourcing startup capital from centralized, opaque, and hierarchical VCs (often with undisclosed LPs), and ideally receive funding directly from stakeholders. Instead, as an alternative to venture capitalists, \"The Ownership Economy\" would be better served by transparent investments through worker self-directed investment DAOs, controlled directly by organized laborers. These worker self-directed DAOs could have more flexible, social or community-driven investment theses that aren’t bound by a fiduciary responsibility to seek outsized financial returns for LPs.\n\n### Strengthening community ownership: industry standards\n\nIn order to preserve its meaning, I believe we need an agreed upon set of criteria to evaluate \"community ownership\". Currently, [any platform](https://bitclout.com/) can claim to be \"owned\" by its users, and there is no real shared standard for gauging how true this is.\n\nI would suggest the development of a Community Ownership Assessment like the B Corp Impact Assessment, which scores companies based on criteria like impact on workers, community, customers, and corporate governance. A Community Ownership Assessment could take into account forms of transparency, equitable token distribution, and democratic participation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n\"The Ownership Economy\" is an important idea. It outlines a promising movement to bring more power to users and help communities capture more of the value they generate. It’s an important enough idea that it deserves greater scrutiny and higher standards that will allow organizations to live up to the promise of its thesis: the development of new economic models for networks that are built, owned, and operated by their users.\n\n***\n\n*If you enjoyed this post, be sure to leave a tip.

A crypto-native subculture will emerge around the medium first.\n\nLet's look at two subcultures that may provide inspiration for how NFTs might evolve:\n\n- Photography as an art form\n- Streetwear as fashion\n\nPhotography was rejected by the art establishment until late in the 20th century, almost a century after it was invented.\n\n> They saw photography merely as a thoughtless mechanism for replication, one that lacked, “that refined feeling and sentiment which animate the productions of a man of genius.” [source](https://daily.jstor.org/when-photography-was-not-art/)\n\nStreetwear, similarly, was seen as a low form of fashion consumed by a low-brow audience.\n\nSome important properties of disruptive subcultures:\n\n**Practiced by outsiders**\n- Photography: Camera equipment tinkerers\n- Streetwear: Skater kids\n\n**Considered culturally inferior**\n- Photography: Not art, but the output of a \"machine\"\n- Streetwear: Logos on sweatshirts, no appreciation for craft or materials of fashion\n\n**New marketplaces and connoisseurship criteria**\n- Photography: Collector community outside of “art world”\n- Streetwear: Bespoke online and retail marketplaces\n\nBoth result in controversy and a rejection of the new form among the old guard. Both are initially adopted by outsiders to the dominant culture.\n\nEventually, the old guard starts to slowly embrace the new medium, because the economic and cultural opportunities are too big to miss out on. Finally, the new culture is merged wholesale into the old.\n\nNFT culture will evolve following a similar trajectory. NFT art won’t be taken seriously by the art world at first. Crypto-natives will blaze their unique path and create a new culture.\n\nThe best example of NFT culture today may be community  \"portraits\" of crypto founders. Every civilization valorizes its heroes through art, and crypto is no different.\n\n[](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1349060357889908737)", "timestamp": 1625759857, "digest": "OQrTGdbiDDKs-7it-URF2NYRG9xLMYEQcNnET8fah3I", "contributor": "0x5507dbd48a5A5bAcE8a6030e878cC4E0af147C33"}

They transcend platforms, geographic locations, and language. NFTs are slowly becoming the economic infrastructure behind the internet's content and creators. Recent demand for meme NFTs has proven memes are more valuable when minted as NFTs. Here we explore minting memes as NFTs, arguing that soon most memes will be minted as NFTs due to advantages in monetization, provenance, attribution, and platform-agnosticism. \n\nWe define *meme* in this piece not by its broad definition as \"a passing element of a culture or system of behavior\" but by its media-focused definition of \"a humorous image, video, piece of text, etc., that is copied (often with slight variations) and spread rapidly by internet users.\" This makes the argument easier to comprehend, though many of the fundamentals argued in this piece may apply to memes more broadly.\n\n## First Classic Memes, then Fresh Memes\n\nMost memes that have recently auctioned as NFTs have been mostly pre-existing memes, meaning they were initially created off-chain and have been circulating the internet pre-minting. Some examples of pre-existing memes minted as NFTs are Doge, Nyan Cat, Disaster Girl, Bad Luck Brian, and more by the day. \n\n[Memes turned NFTs | Yupcollections](https://app.yup.io/collections/memes-turned-nfts/CguHLel)\n\nThe minting of classic memes as NFTs serves as a precursor for genuine 'fresh memes' that originate as NFTs. As sales for meme NFTs exploded, meme lords and comedians have begun creating memes directly as NFTs on NFT platforms. See below a hilarious meme by comedian/artist SlyFly. \n\n[NFT Not Dead | Foundation](https://foundation.app/@slyflynft/nft-not-dead-45350)\n\nAll memes should be minted as NFTs whether or not people are planning to sell them, profit from them, or believe their price will increase over time. This will enable the birth of the Meme Economy. \n\n[https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1370373708506750977?s=20](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1370373708506750977?s=20)\n\n### Provenance - \"Proof-of-First\"\n\nNFTs are platform-agnostic, which means they can exist in various platforms while retaining uniqueness and authenticity. For example, as the graphic highlights below, the Nyan Cat NFT is showcased and displayed on various marketplaces and platforms. The famous meme GIF is linked to the address of the NFT so when someone shares the original NFT in their article, they can pull the on-chain address. This is powerful for memes because it allows them to maintain attribution and context in every platform. So any action on a meme NFT is accessible, readable, and usable in almost all platforms. Every bid, swap, and transaction is added to the metadata of that specific NFT.\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2d130e12-926b-4293=838&width=1630)\n\n\n\nAs Web3 social continues to evolve, the engagement data associated with an NFT also becomes platform agnostic. With [Yup](http://yup.io), for example, the likes and comments given across the web are tied directly to an NFT. This is quite different than web2 social. For example, if a meme is shared on both FB and Twitter, there's no relationship between those two memes so hard to attribute the relationship between the two. Platforms can be scraped and AI can identify memes, but the data gathered on each platform is siloed.\n\n**Why would someone attribute correctly?** \n\nSome critics would argue that most creators will circumvent attributing their work to existing meme templates, claiming that they will mint images that they don't own. In most cases, there are no rights and copyright for commercial use but they are getting rewarded for it.\n\n1. **Platform restrictions** - While plagiarism is mostly legal and hard to regulate, institutions and communities have set their own standards for plagiarism and citing sources that most of the world recognizes. A majority of colleges, for example, will expel students for blatant plagiarism. We should expect the same to happen with web3 communities, and we've already witnessed several examples. Moderation, censorship, etc. can be done in centralized way or decentralized. \n2. **For exposure** - Feeds, leaderboards, references. This will certainly increase NFT sales.\n3. **Composability** - Virtual realities, metaverse, \n4. **Social norms** - \n5. **Self-Attribution** - Citing sources to your work will help ensure that your sources are cited. A great web2 example of this is Google Scholar, which requires uploads to have proper citing and reference other works. Researchers don't have to comply but look to be correctly cited when future papers are inspired by their research.\n\nThe platform-agnostic features of NFTs, the immutability of the blockchain, and decentralized governance make for a perfect recipe of provenance and economic incentives.\n\n[https://twitter.com/naval/status/1378955787171602432?s=20](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1378955787171602432?s=20)\n\n### Layered Splits\n\nIf we assume that creators will want to mint and correctly attribute their memes, how do we achieve that? How can we leverage web3 infrastructure to optimize for direct and frictionless monetization between so many parties? The current answer is *splits.*\n\nWhile the concept behind splits isn't new, [Mirror](http://mirror.xyz) was the first to formally productize the feature. More recently we've witnessed [Foundation](http://foundation.app) use them for NFTs and expect other NFT marketplaces to follow suit. Splits lets creators route funds continuously to collaborators, according to a set of percentage allocations. The social graph that emerges from this will be as important as the money distributed in the process. To understand how this applies to memes, consider that a meme has two layers: \n\n1. Template - the foundation of a viral meme, templates are often the image of the meme or the main character/face. At r/memeeconomy, users can 'invest' in meme templates, support artists, and find inspiration for memes yet to be captioned. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0cf67d-819e-4a83-aac5-205b72a044a2.jpeg?height=838&width=1630)\n\n2. Caption - the commentary or copy associated or added atop a template. This is the original message that each meme lord prescribes a meme. Various captions can and do use the same template, yet are their own meme/message. \n\nSplitting ownership and revenue by layers was close to impossible pre-smart contracts. Today, on-chain splits can serve as a means of distributing royalties associated with a meme to collaborators at different layers, all correctly cited and rewarded. See our 'For The Better, Right?\" meme that uses the Star Wars scene as its template but has a unique caption added by us. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac729cb6-15f4-4584-a75b-7df5fd6ad063.jpeg?height=838&width=1252)\n\nAn existing example of a marketplace enabling layered art is [Async.Art](http://async.art) - an NFT platform for programmable media, which separates image layers into individual assets, allowing users to use them in powerful ways. It won't be long before we see some of the above mentioned 'classic meme' templates be used as layers in [Async.Art](http://async.Art) memes with unique captions. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/99695862-cf4f-4bc1-bad5-315f0ea15377.jpeg?height=768&width=1024)\n\nRight now, some may argue that it is ridiculous to mint every meme for the following reasons. Others may suggest that people won't mint memes of NFTs because it is expensive. But seeing improvements in layer 1 and layer 2, it's becoming cheaper and cheaper to mint any graphics as an NFT\n\nWhat we expect to see next is price of NFTs will drop to a cent or less than a cent. Once it's cheap enough to casually mint NFTs, people will. This gives meme NFTs an additional utility as building blocks for other meme NFTs, just as template memes are building blocks for future memes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo conclude, as it becomes easier and cheaper to mint NFTs, users can retain ownership and buyers can speculate and commemorate the NFTs moving forward.\n\nAllow multilayered memes so that users can use existing memes or own memes while maintain attributions and royalties. Once we have that infrastructure in place, one can make a meme from other memes and the metadata becomes platform agnostic. The economics play out in such a manner that users are incentivized for using their own memes. Incentivize the norms and using the memes the that they use which will make people use more memes. To be able to build more value around in meme creation in a very clean and transparent marketplace. Incentivize creators to make more memes. \n\nLastly, this will also incentivize creators to curate valuable memes in the context of their own platforms and across the web in order to participate in the reward association. Ultimately, it is a win win, for curators, platforms and fans that allow memes to evolve to a fully functioning economy.\n\n\n### NFT \n\n*If address is verified, we pledge to transfer 15% of NFT revenue with the earliest known creator of the meme and user of the meme's template (as recognized by [knowyourmeme.com](http://knowyourmeme.com)), *[starwarsposting](https://twitter.com/starwarsposting/status/1384856874080690177).*\n\n### Resources\n\n[NFTs & the Meme Economy | kabessa](https://app.yup.io/collections/nfts-%26-the-meme-economy/5iVSY6U)\n\n[NFT Projects | kabessa](https://app.yup.io/collections/nft-projects/rwsWItw)\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1625768406, "digest": "bDMST-9H2_2pXLHkO8b_1mCargJk56BGGFXEKBQtL8I", "contributor": "0x4303Ddc9943D862f2B205aF468a4A786c5137E76"}

For example, as the graphic highlights below, the Nyan Cat NFT is showcased and displayed on various marketplaces and platforms. The famous meme GIF is linked to the address of the NFT so when someone shares the original NFT in their article, they can pull the on-chain address. This is powerful for memes because it allows them to maintain attribution and context in every platform. So any action on a meme NFT is accessible, readable, and usable in almost all platforms. Every bid, swap, and transaction is added to the metadata of that specific NFT.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/951f5a64-ff12-4881-a4fb-d6504f4995fe.jpeg?height=838&width=1630)\n\nAs Web3 social continues to evolve, the engagement data associated with an NFT also becomes platform agnostic. With [Yup](http://yup.io), for example, the likes and comments given across the web are tied directly to an NFT. This is quite different than web2 social. For example, if a meme is shared on both FB and Twitter, there's no relationship between those two memes so hard to attribute the relationship between the two. Platforms can be scraped and AI can identify memes, but the data gathered on each platform is siloed.\n\n**Why would someone attribute correctly?** \n\nSome critics would argue that most creators will circumvent attributing their work to existing meme templates, claiming that they will mint images that they don't own. In most cases, there are no rights and copyright for commercial use but they are getting rewarded for it.\n\n1. **Platform restrictions** - While plagiarism is mostly legal and hard to regulate, institutions and communities have set their own standards for plagiarism and citing sources that most of the world recognizes. A majority of colleges, for example, will expel students for blatant plagiarism. We should expect the same to happen with web3 communities, and we've already witnessed several examples. Moderation, censorship, etc. can be done in centralized way or decentralized. \n2. **For exposure** - Feeds, leaderboards, references. This will certainly increase NFT sales.\n3. **Composability** - Virtual realities, metaverse, \n4. **Social norms** - \n5. **Self-Attribution** - Citing sources to your work will help ensure that your sources are cited. A great web2 example of this is Google Scholar, which requires uploads to have proper citing and reference other works.

How can we leverage web3 infrastructure to optimize for direct and frictionless monetization between so many parties? The current answer is *splits.*\n\nWhile the concept behind splits isn't new, [Mirror](http://mirror.xyz) was the first to formally productize the feature. More recently we've witnessed [Foundation](http://foundation.app) use them for NFTs and expect other NFT marketplaces to follow suit. Splits lets creators route funds continuously to collaborators, according to a set of percentage allocations. The social graph that emerges from this will be as important as the money distributed in the process. To understand how this applies to memes, consider that a meme has two layers: \n\n\n1. Template - the foundation of a viral meme, templates are often the image of the meme or the main character/face. At r/memeeconomy, users can 'invest' in meme templates, support artists, and find inspiration for memes yet to be captioned. \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0cf67d-819e-4a83-aac5-205b72a044a2.jpeg?height=838&width=1630)\n\n2.Caption - the commentary or copy associated or added atop a template. This is the original message that each meme lord prescribes a meme. Various captions can and do use the same template, yet are their own meme/message. \n\nSplitting ownership and revenue by layers was close to impossible pre-smart contracts. Today, on-chain splits can serve as a means of distributing royalties associated with a meme to collaborators at different layers, all correctly cited and rewarded. See our 'For The Better, Right?\" meme that uses the Star Wars scene as its template but has a unique caption added by us. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac729cb6-15f4-4584-a75b-7df5fd6ad063.jpeg?height=838&width=1252)\n\nAn existing example of a marketplace enabling layered art is [Async.Art](http://async.art) - an NFT platform for programmable media, which separates image layers into individual assets, allowing users to use them in powerful ways. It won't be long before we see some of the above mentioned 'classic meme' templates be used as layers in [Async.Art](http://async.Art) memes with unique captions. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/99695862-cf4f-4bc1-bad5-315f0ea15377.jpeg?height=768&width=1024)\n\nRight now, some may argue that it is ridiculous to mint every meme for the following reasons. Others may suggest that people won't mint memes of NFTs because it is expensive. But seeing improvements in layer 1 and layer 2, it's becoming cheaper and cheaper to mint any graphics as an NFT\n\nWhat we expect to see next is price of NFTs will drop to a cent or less than a cent. Once it's cheap enough to casually mint NFTs, people will. This gives meme NFTs an additional utility as building blocks for other meme NFTs, just as template memes are building blocks for future memes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs it becomes easier and cheaper to mint NFTs, users can retain ownership and buyers can speculate and commemorate the NFTs moving forward.\n\nMarketplaces will allow multilayered memes so that users can use existing memes or own memes while maintain attributions and royalties.

An opportunity to experiment with how we collaborate (organizational design / DAO). To nurture meaningful relationships in both the digital and physical realms (community / people). To simply build cool sh*t with amazing people (purpose).\n\n> Purpose + people + DAO = magic ✨\n\n\n### Our mission is to create spaces for collective prosperity to thrive. \nProsperDAO is seeded in [Celo](https://twitter.com/CeloOrg)’s mission of prosperity for everyone and celebrates the interoperable and interconnected nature of web3. ProsperDAO is for anyone in the broader crypto community aligned to this spirit of purpose—especially those who want to have FUN in the process.\n\nWe hope to spark a global community of leaders committed to spreading prosperity globally. Without overpowering, extracting from, neglecting, or dismissing. Instead, having the courage to stand in prosperity and hold the space for others to do the same. \n\n## It started in 2019...\nIn 2019,  a group of us hosted a retreat with good peeps that led to co-founders meeting, new projects launching, and unexpected magic. The intent was to bring prosperity to life through a shared  experience. By the end, there were ideas to turn it into a three month experience and desire to host retreats around the world. The overwhelming positive feedback of this experience energized us to bring people back together IRL and to do so with DAO infrastructure to support it.\n\n## ...picking up where we left off this fall\nThis September, ~80 people will be [gathering in the Catskill Mountains](https://prosperdao.xyz/) for ProsperDAO’s genesis weekend. To finalize the [principles](https://www.notion.so/Principles-v1-7c9639cf1c8649d1a21a93bd8f32af1c) & manifesto. To build community. To hug (remember that?!). To shape the future of ProsperDAO.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2ea71f39-ae47-4027-85de-43f6e43d10d0.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## Let’s DAO it\nAt their best, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations enable experimental, anti-hierarchical, fluid structures that optimize for organic and meaningful contributions from a collective intelligence. The DAO infrastructure creates greater community ownership and decision-making. We’re still just scratching the surface for what’s possible when people move from intrinsic motivation. We’re excited to prototype new methods of intentional organizing and sharing our findings along the way.\n\n## Wait, so what will we actually do?\nHost really amazing experiences around the world. Build products & relationships. Maybe spark a movement. And just hang...yes, more chillin’.\n\n## Today is the MVD—Minimum Viable DAO\nThis day marks the launch of the MVD. The minimum amount of infrastructure needed to start building in public and with the community. This includes: a multi-sig, legal entity (almost complete!), purpose, [principles](https://www.notion.so/Principles-v1-7c9639cf1c8649d1a21a93bd8f32af1c), & plenty of artwork. There is still much to figure out, including how new members join ProsperDAO. We’ll be finalizing much of this, with ProsperDAO’s current and future members, in the coming months and at the [genesis retreat weekend](http://prosperdao.xyz).\n\n## Genesis Members\nHumbly at your service, meet the folks who have been dedicated to getting ProsperDAO off of the ground. A collective of creatives, programmers, healers, investors, operators, and advocates dreaming prosperity into existence. \n\n- [Adriana Cerundolo](https://twitter.com/adrisonic)\n- [Daniel Olarte](https://twitter.com/DanielOlarte_)\n- [Evan Kereiakes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evan-kereiakes/)\n- [Gabrielle Micheletti](https://twitter.com/gabriellemic)\n- [Jarrell James](https://twitter.com/techboiafrica)\n- [Josh Crites](https://twitter.com/critesjosh_)\n- [Nitya Subramanian](https://twitter.com/_nityas)\n- [Vanessa Slavich](https://twitter.com/vslavich)\n- [Yaz Khoury](https://twitter.com/Yazanator)\n\n## Let the adventure begin.\nWith our MVD in the pocket, we’re excited to meet other folks aligned to the purpose and broader experiment. \n\nInterested in what we’re up to?

Here we explore minting memes as NFTs, arguing that soon most memes will be minted as NFTs due to advantages in monetization, provenance, attribution, and platform-agnosticism. \n\nWe define *meme* in this piece not by its broad definition as \"a passing element of a culture or system of behavior\" but by its media-focused definition of \"a humorous image, video, piece of text, etc., that is copied (often with slight variations) and spread rapidly by internet users.\" This makes the argument easier to comprehend, though many of the fundamentals argued in this piece may apply to memes more broadly.\n\n## First Classic Memes, then Fresh Memes\n\nMost memes that have recently auctioned as NFTs have been mostly pre-existing memes, meaning they were initially created off-chain and have been circulating the internet pre-minting. Some examples of pre-existing memes minted as NFTs are Doge, Nyan Cat, Disaster Girl, Bad Luck Brian, and more by the day. \n\n[Memes turned NFTs | Yupcollections](https://app.yup.io/collections/memes-turned-nfts/CguHLel)\n\nThe minting of classic memes as NFTs serves as a precursor for genuine 'fresh memes' that originate as NFTs. As sales for meme NFTs exploded, meme lords and comedians have begun creating memes directly as NFTs on NFT platforms.

For example, as the graphic highlights below, the Nyan Cat NFT is showcased and displayed on various marketplaces and platforms. The famous meme GIF is linked to the address of the NFT so when someone shares the original NFT in their article, they can pull the on-chain address. This is powerful for memes because it allows them to maintain attribution and context in every platform. So any action on a meme NFT is accessible, readable, and usable on almost all platforms. Every bid, swap, and transaction is added to the metadata of that specific NFT.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/951f5a64-ff12-4881-a4fb-d6504f4995fe.jpeg?height=838&width=1630)\n\nAs Web3 social continues to evolve, the engagement data associated with an NFT also become platform agnostic. With [Yup](http://yup.io), for example, the likes and comments given across the web are tied directly to an NFT. This is quite different than web2 social. For example, if a meme is shared on both FB and Twitter, there's no relationship between those two memes so hard to attribute the relationship between the two. Platforms can be scraped and AI can identify memes, but the data gathered on each platform is siloed.\n\n**Why would someone attribute correctly?** \n\nSome critics would argue that most creators will circumvent attributing their work to existing meme templates, claiming that they will mint images that they don't own.

To understand how this applies to memes, consider that a meme has two layers: \n\n\n1. Template - the foundation of a viral meme, templates are often the image of the meme or the main character/face. At r/memeeconomy, users can 'invest' in meme templates, support artists, and find inspiration for memes yet to be captioned. \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0cf67d-819e-4a83-aac5-205b72a044a2.jpeg?height=838&width=1630)\n\n2.Caption - the commentary or copy associated or added atop a template. This is the original message that each meme lord prescribes a meme. Various captions can and do use the same template, yet are their own meme/message. \n\nSplitting ownership and revenue by layers was close to impossible pre-smart contracts. Today, on-chain splits can serve as a means of distributing royalties associated with a meme to collaborators at different layers, all correctly cited and rewarded. See our 'For The Better, Right?\" meme that uses the Star Wars scene as its template but has a unique caption added by us. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac729cb6-15f4-4584-a75b-7df5fd6ad063.jpeg?height=838&width=1252)\n\nAn existing example of a marketplace enabling layered art is [Async.Art](http://async.art) - an NFT platform for programmable media, which separates image layers into individual assets, allowing users to use them in powerful ways. It won't be long before we see some of the above-mentioned 'classic meme' templates be used as layers in [Async.Art](http://async.Art) memes with unique captions. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/99695862-cf4f-4bc1-bad5-315f0ea15377.jpeg?height=768&width=1024)\n\nRight now, some may argue that it is ridiculous to mint every meme for the following reasons. Others may suggest that people won't mint memes of NFTs because it is expensive. But seeing improvements in layer 1 and layer 2, it's becoming cheaper and cheaper to mint any graphics as an NFT\n\nWhat we expect to see next is the price of NFTs will drop to a cent or less than a cent. Once it's cheap enough to casually mint NFTs, people will. This gives meme NFTs an additional utility as building blocks for other meme NFTs, just as template memes are building blocks for future memes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs it becomes easier and cheaper to mint NFTs, users can retain ownership and buyers can speculate and commemorate the NFTs moving forward.\n\nMarketplaces will allow multilayered memes so that users can use existing memes or own memes while maintain attributions and royalties. Once we have that infrastructure in place, one can make a meme from other memes and the metadata becomes platform agnostic. The economics play out in such a manner that users are incentivized to cite correctly.\n\nLastly, this will also incentivize creators to curate valuable memes in the context of their own platforms and across the web in order to participate in the reward association.

They transcend platforms, geographic locations, and language. NFTs are slowly becoming the economic infrastructure behind the internet's content and creators.

For example, as the graphic highlights below, the Nyan Cat NFT is showcased and displayed on various marketplaces and platforms. The famous meme GIF is linked to the address of the NFT so when someone shares the original NFT in their article, they can pull the on-chain address. This is powerful for memes because it allows them to maintain attribution and context in every platform. So any action on a meme NFT is accessible, readable, and usable on almost all platforms. Every bid, swap, and transaction is added to the metadata of that specific NFT.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/951f5a64-ff12-4881-a4fb-d6504f4995fe.jpeg?height=838&width=1630)\n\nAs Web3 social continues to evolve, the engagement data associated with an NFT also become platform agnostic. With [Yup](http://yup.io), for example, the likes and comments given across the web are tied directly to an NFT. This is quite different than web2 social. For example, if a meme is shared on both FB and Twitter, there's no relationship between those two memes so hard to attribute the relationship between the two. Platforms can be scraped and AI can identify memes, but the data gathered on each platform is siloed.\n\n**Why would someone attribute correctly?** \n\nSome critics would argue that most creators will circumvent attributing their work to existing meme templates, claiming that they will mint images that they don't own.

How can we leverage web3 infrastructure to optimize for direct and frictionless monetization between so many parties?

More recently we've witnessed [Foundation](http://foundation.app) use them for NFTs and expect other NFT marketplaces to follow suit.

To understand how this applies to memes, consider that a meme has two layers: \n\n\n1. Template - the foundation of a viral meme, templates are often the image of the meme or the main character/face. At r/memeeconomy, users can 'invest' in meme templates, support artists, and find inspiration for memes yet to be captioned. \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0cf67d-819e-4a83-aac5-205b72a044a2.jpeg?height=838&width=1630)\n\n2.Caption - the commentary or copy associated or added atop a template. This is the original message that each meme lord prescribes a meme. Various captions can and do use the same template, yet are their own meme/message. \n\nSplitting ownership and revenue by layers was close to impossible pre-smart contracts. Today, on-chain splits can serve as a means of distributing royalties associated with a meme to collaborators at different layers, all correctly cited and rewarded. See our 'For The Better, Right?\" meme that uses the Star Wars scene as its template but has a unique caption added by us. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac729cb6-15f4-4584-a75b-7df5fd6ad063.jpeg?height=838&width=1252)\n\nAn existing example of a marketplace enabling layered art is [Async.Art](http://async.art) - an NFT platform for programmable media, which separates image layers into individual assets, allowing users to use them in powerful ways. It won't be long before we see some of the above-mentioned 'classic meme' templates be used as layers in [Async.Art](http://async.Art) memes with unique captions. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/99695862-cf4f-4bc1-bad5-315f0ea15377.jpeg?height=768&width=1024)\n\nRight now, some may argue that it is ridiculous to mint every meme for the following reasons. Others may suggest that people won't mint memes of NFTs because it is expensive. But seeing improvements in layer 1 and layer 2, it's becoming cheaper and cheaper to mint any graphics as an NFT\n\nWhat we expect to see next is the price of NFTs will drop to a cent or less than a cent. Once it's cheap enough to casually mint NFTs, people will. This gives meme NFTs an additional utility as building blocks for other meme NFTs, just as template memes are building blocks for future memes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs it becomes easier and cheaper to mint NFTs, users can retain ownership and buyers can speculate and commemorate the NFTs moving forward.\n\nMarketplaces will allow multilayered memes so that users can use existing memes or own memes while maintain attributions and royalties. Once we have that infrastructure in place, one can make a meme from other memes and the metadata becomes platform agnostic.

{"id": "KPHmCLm3e76foQ0VKHrm-BDZsJ-aV-H78qZwo_UzlEc", "title": "NFTs & the Meme Economy", "body": "The dankest memes of the future will be NFTs\n\nMemes are the internet's native art form. They transcend platforms, geographic locations, and language. NFTs are slowly becoming the economic infrastructure behind the internet's content and creators. Recent demand for meme NFTs has proven memes are more valuable when minted as NFTs. Here we explore minting memes as NFTs, arguing that soon most memes will be minted as NFTs due to advantages in monetization, provenance, attribution, and platform-agnosticism. \n\nWe define *meme* in this piece not by its broad definition as \"a passing element of a culture or system of behavior\" but by its media-focused definition of \"a humorous image, video, piece of text, etc., that is copied (often with slight variations) and spread rapidly by internet users.\" This makes the argument easier to comprehend, though many of the fundamentals argued in this piece may apply to memes more broadly.\n\n## First Classic Memes, then Fresh Memes\n\nMost memes that have recently auctioned as NFTs have been mostly pre-existing memes, meaning they were initially created off-chain and have been circulating the internet pre-minting. Some examples of pre-existing memes minted as NFTs are Doge, Nyan Cat, Disaster Girl, Bad Luck Brian, and more by the day. \n\n[Memes turned NFTs | Yupcollections](https://app.yup.io/collections/memes-turned-nfts/CguHLel)\n\nThe minting of classic memes as NFTs serves as a precursor for genuine 'fresh memes' that originate as NFTs. As sales for meme NFTs exploded, meme lords and comedians have begun creating memes directly as NFTs on NFT platforms. See below a hilarious meme by comedian/artist SlyFly. \n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/45350)\n\nAll memes should be minted as NFTs whether or not people are planning to sell them, profit from them, or believe their price will increase over time. This will enable the birth of the Meme Economy. \n\n[https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1370373708506750977?s=20](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1370373708506750977?s=20)\n\n### Provenance - \"Proof-of-First\"\n\nNFTs are platform-agnostic, which means they can exist in various platforms while retaining uniqueness and authenticity. For example, as the graphic highlights below, the Nyan Cat NFT is showcased and displayed on various marketplaces and platforms. The famous meme GIF is linked to the address of the NFT so when someone shares the original NFT in their article, they can pull the on-chain address. This is powerful for memes because it allows them to maintain attribution and context in every platform. So any action on a meme NFT is accessible, readable, and usable on almost all platforms. Every bid, swap, and transaction is added to the metadata of that specific NFT.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/951f5a64-ff12-4881-a4fb-d6504f4995fe.jpeg?height=838&width=1630)\n\nAs Web3 social continues to evolve, the engagement data associated with an NFT also become platform agnostic. With [Yup](http://yup.io), for example, the likes and comments given across the web are tied directly to an NFT. This is quite different than web2 social. For example, if a meme is shared on both FB and Twitter, there's no relationship between those two memes so hard to attribute the relationship between the two. Platforms can be scraped and AI can identify memes, but the data gathered on each platform is siloed.\n\n**Why would someone attribute correctly?** \n\nSome critics would argue that most creators will circumvent attributing their work to existing meme templates, claiming that they will mint images that they don't own. In most cases, there are no rights and copyright for commercial use but they are getting rewarded for it.\n\n1. **Platform restrictions** - While plagiarism is mostly legal and hard to regulate, institutions and communities have set their own standards for plagiarism and citing sources that most of the world recognizes. A majority of colleges, for example, will expel students for blatant plagiarism. We should expect the same to happen with web3 communities, and we've already witnessed several examples. Moderation, censorship, etc. can be done in a centralized way or decentralized. \n2. **For exposure** - Feeds, leaderboards, references. This will certainly increase NFT sales.\n3. **Composability** - Virtual realities, metaverse, \n4. **Social norms** - \n5. **Self-Attribution** - Citing sources to your work will help ensure that your sources are cited. A great web2 example of this is Google Scholar, which requires uploads to have proper citing and reference other works. Researchers don't have to comply but look to be correctly cited when future papers are inspired by their research.\n\nThe platform-agnostic features of NFTs, the immutability of the blockchain, and decentralized governance make for a perfect recipe of provenance and economic incentives.\n\n[https://twitter.com/naval/status/1378955787171602432?s=20](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1378955787171602432?s=20)\n\n### Layered Splits\n\nIf we assume that creators will want to mint and correctly attribute their memes, how do we achieve that? How can we leverage web3 infrastructure to optimize for direct and frictionless monetization between so many parties? The current answer is *splits.*\n\nWhile the concept behind splits isn't new, [Mirror](http://mirror.xyz) was the first to formally productize the feature. More recently we've witnessed [Foundation](http://foundation.app) use them for NFTs and expect other NFT marketplaces to follow suit. Splits let creators route funds continuously to collaborators, according to a set of percentage allocations. Check out our split for this article, citing some others that helped us: \n\n[NFTs & the Meme Economy](split://0x9Baa2a255282C7c71321488626293Fe8737Fb8ef?network=mainnet)\n\nThe social graph that emerges from this will be as important as the money distributed in the process. To understand how this applies to memes, consider that a meme has two layers: \n\n\n1. Template - the foundation of a viral meme, templates are often the image of the meme or the main character/face. At r/memeeconomy, users can 'invest' in meme templates, support artists, and find inspiration for memes yet to be captioned. \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0cf67d-819e-4a83-aac5-205b72a044a2.jpeg?height=838&width=1630)\n\n2.Caption - the commentary or copy associated or added atop a template. This is the original message that each meme lord prescribes a meme. Various captions can and do use the same template, yet are their own meme/message. \n\nSplitting ownership and revenue by layers was close to impossible pre-smart contracts. Today, on-chain splits can serve as a means of distributing royalties associated with a meme to collaborators at different layers, all correctly cited and rewarded. See our 'For The Better, Right?\" meme that uses the Star Wars scene as its template but has a unique caption added by us. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac729cb6-15f4-4584-a75b-7df5fd6ad063.jpeg?height=838&width=1252)\n\nAn existing example of a marketplace enabling layered art is [Async.Art](http://async.art) - an NFT platform for programmable media, which separates image layers into individual assets, allowing users to use them in powerful ways. It won't be long before we see some of the above-mentioned 'classic meme' templates be used as layers in [Async.Art](http://async.Art) memes with unique captions. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/99695862-cf4f-4bc1-bad5-315f0ea15377.jpeg?height=768&width=1024)\n\nRight now, some may argue that it is ridiculous to mint every meme for the following reasons.

Moderation, censorship, etc. can be done in a centralized way or decentralized. \n2. **For exposure** - Feeds, leaderboards, references. This will certainly increase NFT sales.\n3. **Self-Attribution** - Citing sources to your work will help ensure that your sources are cited. A great web2 example of this is Google Scholar, which requires uploads to have proper citing and reference other works. Researchers don't have to comply but look to be correctly cited when future papers are inspired by their research.\n\nThe platform-agnostic features of NFTs, the immutability of the blockchain, and decentralized governance make for a perfect recipe of provenance and economic incentives.\n\n[https://twitter.com/naval/status/1378955787171602432?s=20](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1378955787171602432?s=20)\n\n### Layered Splits\n\nIf we assume that creators will want to mint and correctly attribute their memes, how do we achieve that? How can we leverage web3 infrastructure to optimize for direct and frictionless monetization between so many parties? The current answer is *splits.*\n\nWhile the concept behind splits isn't new, [Mirror](http://mirror.xyz) was the first to formally productize the feature. More recently we've witnessed [Foundation](http://foundation.app) use them for NFTs and expect other NFT marketplaces to follow suit. Splits let creators route funds continuously to collaborators, according to a set of percentage allocations. Check out our split for this article, citing some others that helped us: \n\n[NFTs & the Meme Economy](split://0x9Baa2a255282C7c71321488626293Fe8737Fb8ef?network=mainnet)\n\nThe social graph that emerges from this will be as important as the money distributed in the process. To understand how this applies to memes, consider that a meme has two layers: \n\n\n1. Template - the foundation of a viral meme, templates are often the image of the meme or the main character/face. At r/memeeconomy, users can 'invest' in meme templates, support artists, and find inspiration for memes yet to be captioned. \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0cf67d-819e-4a83-aac5-205b72a044a2.jpeg?height=838&width=1630)\n\n2.Caption - the commentary or copy associated or added atop a template. This is the original message that each meme lord prescribes a meme. Various captions can and do use the same template, yet are their own meme/message. \n\nSplitting ownership and revenue by layers was close to impossible pre-smart contracts. Today, on-chain splits can serve as a means of distributing royalties associated with a meme to collaborators at different layers, all correctly cited and rewarded. See our 'For The Better, Right?\" meme that uses the Star Wars scene as its template but has a unique caption added by us. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac729cb6-15f4-4584-a75b-7df5fd6ad063.jpeg?height=838&width=1252)\n\nAn existing example of a marketplace enabling layered art is [Async.Art](http://async.art) - an NFT platform for programmable media, which separates image layers into individual assets, allowing users to use them in powerful ways. It won't be long before we see some of the above-mentioned 'classic meme' templates be used as layers in [Async.Art](http://async.Art) memes with unique captions. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/99695862-cf4f-4bc1-bad5-315f0ea15377.jpeg?height=768&width=1024)\n\nRight now, some may argue that it is ridiculous to mint every meme for the following reasons. Others may suggest that people won't mint memes of NFTs because it is expensive. But seeing improvements in layer 1 and layer 2, it's becoming cheaper and cheaper to mint any graphics as an NFT\n\nWhat we expect to see next is the price of NFTs will drop to a cent or less than a cent. Once it's cheap enough to casually mint NFTs, people will. This gives meme NFTs an additional utility as building blocks for other meme NFTs, just as template memes are building blocks for future memes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs it becomes easier and cheaper to mint NFTs, users can retain ownership and buyers can speculate and commemorate the NFTs moving forward.\n\nMarketplaces will allow multilayered memes so that users can use existing memes or own memes while maintain attributions and royalties. Once we have that infrastructure in place, one can make a meme from other memes and the metadata becomes platform agnostic. The economics play out in such a manner that users are incentivized to cite correctly.\n\nLastly, this will also incentivize creators to curate valuable memes in the context of their own platforms and across the web in order to participate in the reward association. Ultimately, it is a win-win, for curators, platforms, and fans that allow memes to evolve to a fully functioning economy.\n\n### Resources\n\n[NFTs & the Meme Economy | kabessa](https://app.yup.io/collections/nfts-%26-the-meme-economy/5iVSY6U)\n\n[NFT Projects | kabessa](https://app.yup.io/collections/nft-projects/rwsWItw)\n\n# NFT \n\n*If the address is verified, we pledge to transfer 15% of NFT revenue with the earliest known creator of the meme and user of the meme's template (as recognized by [knowyourmeme.com](http://knowyourmeme.com)), *[starwarsposting](https://twitter.com/starwarsposting/status/1384856874080690177).*\n\n# Tip\n[NFTs & the Meme Economy](split://0x9Baa2a255282C7c71321488626293Fe8737Fb8ef?network=mainnet)", "timestamp": 1625781900, "digest": "bDMST-9H2_2pXLHkO8b_1mCargJk56BGGFXEKBQtL8I", "contributor": "0x4303Ddc9943D862f2B205aF468a4A786c5137E76"}

{"id": "t1FEtuv-RYQkZdWBzRqGvjx0BSVJLiJYpZSqgYiQeMY", "title": "NFTs & the Meme Economy", "body": "The dankest memes of the future will be NFTs\n\nMemes are the internet's native art form. They transcend platforms, geographic locations, and language. NFTs are slowly becoming the economic infrastructure behind the internet's content and creators. Recent demand for meme NFTs has proven memes are more valuable when minted as NFTs. Here we explore minting memes as NFTs, arguing that soon most memes will be minted as NFTs due to advantages in monetization, provenance, attribution, and platform-agnosticism. \n\nWe define *meme* in this piece not by its broad definition as \"a passing element of a culture or system of behavior\" but by its media-focused definition of \"a humorous image, video, piece of text, etc., that is copied (often with slight variations) and spread rapidly by internet users.\" This makes the argument easier to comprehend, though many of the fundamentals argued in this piece may apply to memes more broadly.\n\n## First Classic Memes, then Fresh Memes\n\nMost memes that have recently auctioned as NFTs have been mostly pre-existing memes, meaning they were initially created off-chain and have been circulating the internet pre-minting. Some examples of pre-existing memes minted as NFTs are Doge, Nyan Cat, Disaster Girl, Bad Luck Brian, and more by the day. \n\n[Memes turned NFTs | Yupcollections](https://app.yup.io/collections/memes-turned-nfts/CguHLel)\n\nThe minting of classic memes as NFTs serves as a precursor for genuine 'fresh memes' that originate as NFTs. As sales for meme NFTs exploded, meme lords and comedians have begun creating memes directly as NFTs on NFT platforms. See below a hilarious meme by comedian/artist SlyFly. \n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/45350)\n\nAll memes should be minted as NFTs whether or not people are planning to sell them, profit from them, or believe their price will increase over time. This will enable the birth of the Meme Economy. \n\n[https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1370373708506750977?s=20](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1370373708506750977?s=20)\n\n### Provenance - \"Proof-of-First\"\n\nNFTs are platform-agnostic, which means they can exist in various platforms while retaining uniqueness and authenticity. For example, as the graphic highlights below, the Nyan Cat NFT is showcased and displayed on various marketplaces and platforms. The famous meme GIF is linked to the address of the NFT so when someone shares the original NFT in their article, they can pull the on-chain address. This is powerful for memes because it allows them to maintain attribution and context in every platform. So any action on a meme NFT is accessible, readable, and usable on almost all platforms. Every bid, swap, and transaction is added to the metadata of that specific NFT.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/951f5a64-ff12-4881-a4fb-d6504f4995fe.jpeg?height=838&width=1630)\n\nAs Web3 social continues to evolve, the engagement data associated with an NFT also become platform agnostic. With [Yup](http://yup.io), for example, the likes and comments given across the web are tied directly to an NFT. This is quite different than web2 social. For example, if a meme is shared on both FB and Twitter, there's no relationship between those two memes so hard to attribute the relationship between the two. Platforms can be scraped and AI can identify memes, but the data gathered on each platform is siloed.\n\n**Why would someone attribute correctly?** \n\nSome critics would argue that most creators will circumvent attributing their work to existing meme templates, claiming that they will mint images that they don't own. In most cases, there are no rights and copyright for commercial use but they are getting rewarded for it.\n\n1. **Platform restrictions** - While plagiarism is mostly legal and hard to regulate, institutions and communities have set their own standards for plagiarism and citing sources that most of the world recognizes. A majority of colleges, for example, will expel students for blatant plagiarism. We should expect the same to happen with web3 communities, and we've already witnessed several examples. Moderation, censorship, etc. can be done in a centralized way or decentralized.\n2. **Exposure** - Like hashtags, layers of memes will make them easy to track and curate. False citations will be left out of feeds, leaderboards, and various references that are vital to sales.\n3. **Composability** - Integrating with other platforms, marketplaces, and products require following standards of proper citation. For example, failing to cite the proper Doge meme template may exclude your NFT holders from access to Doge-related content and communities that may stem from the owners of the Doge template. A citation is a form of alignment that most collectors won't want to miss out on. \n4. **Social norms** - Removing all economic incentives, the repetitional harm of neglecting to cite can be just as powerful of a stick. It's quite common to be called out for stealing content, and explicitly misrepresenting the origin of your meme may be taboo by the end of the 20's.\n5. **Self-Attribution** - Citing sources to your work will help ensure that your sources are cited. A great web2 example of this is Google Scholar, which requires uploads to have proper citing and reference other works. Researchers don't have to comply but look to be correctly cited when future papers are inspired by their research.\n\nThe platform-agnostic features of NFTs, the immutability of the blockchain, and decentralized governance make for a perfect recipe of provenance and economic incentives.\n\n[https://twitter.com/naval/status/1378955787171602432?s=20](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1378955787171602432?s=20)\n\n### Layered Splits\n\nIf we assume that creators will want to mint and correctly attribute their memes, how do we achieve that?

They transcend platforms, geographic locations, and language. NFTs are slowly becoming the economic infrastructure behind the internet's content and creators.

Here we explore minting memes as NFTs, arguing that soon most memes will be minted as NFTs due to advantages in monetization, provenance, attribution, and platform-agnosticism. \n\nWe define *meme* in this piece not by its broad definition as \"a passing element of a culture or system of behavior\" but by its media-focused definition of \"a humorous image, video, piece of text, etc., that is copied (often with slight variations) and spread rapidly by internet users.\" This makes the argument easier to comprehend, though many of the fundamentals argued in this piece may apply to memes more broadly.\n\n## First Classic Memes, then Fresh Memes\n\nMost memes that have recently auctioned as NFTs have been mostly pre-existing memes, meaning they were initially created off-chain and have been circulating the internet pre-minting. Some examples of pre-existing memes minted as NFTs are Doge, Nyan Cat, Disaster Girl, Bad Luck Brian, and more by the day. \n\n[Memes turned NFTs | Yupcollections](https://app.yup.io/collections/memes-turned-nfts/CguHLel)\n\nThe minting of classic memes as NFTs serves as a precursor for genuine 'fresh memes' that originate as NFTs.

For example, as the graphic highlights below, the Nyan Cat NFT is showcased and displayed on various marketplaces and platforms. The famous meme GIF is linked to the address of the NFT so when someone shares the original NFT in their article, they can pull the on-chain address. This is powerful for memes because it allows them to maintain attribution and context in every platform. So any action on a meme NFT is accessible, readable, and usable on almost all platforms. Every bid, swap, and transaction is added to the metadata of that specific NFT.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/951f5a64-ff12-4881-a4fb-d6504f4995fe.jpeg?height=838&width=1630)\n\nAs Web3 social continues to evolve, the engagement data associated with an NFT also become platform agnostic.

This is quite different than web2 social, where a meme shared on both FB and Twitter lives separately on those two platforms, essentially two images with no direct relationship between them.\n\n**Why would someone attribute correctly?** \n\nSome critics would argue that most creators will circumvent attributing their work to existing meme templates, claiming that they will mint images that they don't own. In most cases, there are no rights and copyright for commercial use but they are getting rewarded for it.\n\n**Why would someone attribute correctly?** \n\nSome critics would argue that most creators will circumvent attributing their work to existing meme templates, claiming that they will mint images that they don't own. In most cases, there are no rights and copyright for commercial use but they are getting rewarded for it.\n\n1. **Platform restrictions** - While plagiarism is mostly legal and hard to regulate, institutions and communities have set their own standards for plagiarism and citing sources that most of the world recognizes. A majority of colleges, for example, will expel students for blatant plagiarism. We should expect the same to happen with web3 communities, and we've already witnessed several examples. Moderation, censorship, etc. can be done in a centralized way or decentralized.\n2. **Exposure** - Like hashtags, layers of memes will make them easy to track and curate. False citations will be left out of feeds, leaderboards, and various references that are vital to sales.\n3. **Composability** - Integrating with other platforms, marketplaces, and products require following standards of proper citation. For example, failing to cite the proper Doge meme template may exclude your NFT holders from access to Doge-related content and communities that may stem from the owners of the Doge template. A citation is a form of alignment that most collectors won't want to miss out on. \n4. **Social norms** - Removing all economic incentives, the repetitional harm of neglecting to cite can be just as powerful of a stick. It's quite common to be called out for stealing content, and explicitly misrepresenting the origin of your meme may be taboo by the end of the 20's.\n5. **Self-Attribution** - Citing sources to your work will help ensure that your sources are cited. A great web2 example of this is Google Scholar, which requires uploads to have proper citing and reference other works. Researchers don't have to comply but look to be correctly cited when future papers are inspired by their research.\n\nThe platform-agnostic features of NFTs, the immutability of the blockchain, and decentralized governance make for a perfect recipe of provenance and economic incentives.\n\n[https://twitter.com/naval/status/1378955787171602432?s=20](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1378955787171602432?s=20)\n\n### Layered Splits\n\nIf we assume that creators will want to mint and correctly attribute their memes, how do we achieve that? How can we leverage web3 infrastructure to optimize for direct and frictionless monetization between so many parties? The current answer is *splits.*\n\nWhile the concept behind splits isn't new, [Mirror](http://mirror.xyz) was the first to formally productize the feature. More recently we've witnessed [Foundation](http://foundation.app) use them for NFTs and expect other NFT marketplaces to follow suit. Splits let creators route funds continuously to collaborators, according to a set of percentage allocations. Check out our split for this article, citing some others that helped us: \n\n[NFTs & the Meme Economy](split://0x9Baa2a255282C7c71321488626293Fe8737Fb8ef?network=mainnet)\n\nThe social graph that emerges from this will be as important as the money distributed in the process. To understand how this applies to memes, consider that a meme has two layers: \n\n\n1. Template - the foundation of a viral meme, templates are often the image of the meme or the main character/face. At r/memeeconomy, users can 'invest' in meme templates, support artists, and find inspiration for memes yet to be captioned. \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0cf67d-819e-4a83-aac5-205b72a044a2.jpeg?height=838&width=1630)\n\n2.Caption - the commentary or copy associated or added atop a template. This is the original message that each meme lord prescribes a meme. Various captions can and do use the same template, yet are their own meme/message. \n\nSplitting ownership and revenue by layers was close to impossible pre-smart contracts. Today, on-chain splits can serve as a means of distributing royalties associated with a meme to collaborators at different layers, all correctly cited and rewarded. See our 'For The Better, Right?\" meme that uses the Star Wars scene as its template but has a unique caption added by us. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac729cb6-15f4-4584-a75b-7df5fd6ad063.jpeg?height=838&width=1252)\n\nAn existing example of a marketplace enabling layered art is [Async.Art](http://async.art) - an NFT platform for programmable media, which separates image layers into individual assets, allowing users to use them in powerful ways. It won't be long before we see some of the above-mentioned 'classic meme' templates be used as layers in [Async.Art](http://async.Art) memes with unique captions. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/99695862-cf4f-4bc1-bad5-315f0ea15377.jpeg?height=768&width=1024)\n\nRight now, some may argue that it is ridiculous to mint every meme for the following reasons. Others may suggest that people won't mint memes of NFTs because it is expensive. But seeing improvements in layer 1 and layer 2, it's becoming cheaper and cheaper to mint any graphics as an NFT\n\nWhat we expect to see next is the price of NFTs will drop to a cent or less than a cent. Once it's cheap enough to casually mint NFTs, people will. This gives meme NFTs an additional utility as building blocks for other meme NFTs, just as template memes are building blocks for future memes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs it becomes easier and cheaper to mint NFTs, users can retain ownership, and buyers can speculate and commemorate the NFTs moving forward.\n\nMarketplaces will allow multilayered memes so that users can use existing memes or own memes while maintaining attributions and royalties. Once we have that infrastructure in place, one can make a meme from other memes and the metadata becomes platform agnostic. The economics play out in such a manner that users are incentivized to cite correctly.\n\nLastly, this will also incentivize creators to curate valuable memes in the context of their own platforms and across the web in order to participate in the reward association. Ultimately, it is a win-win, for curators, platforms, and fans that allow memes to evolve to a fully functioning economy.\n\n### Resources\n\n[NFTs & the Meme Economy | kabessa](https://app.yup.io/collections/nfts-%26-the-meme-economy/5iVSY6U)\n\n[NFT Projects | kabessa](https://app.yup.io/collections/nft-projects/rwsWItw)\n\n# NFT \n\n*If the address is verified, we pledge to transfer 15% of NFT revenue with the earliest known creator of the meme and user of the meme's template (as recognized by [knowyourmeme.com](http://knowyourmeme.com)), *[starwarsposting](https://twitter.com/starwarsposting/status/1384856874080690177).*\n\n# Tip\n[NFTs & the Meme Economy](split://0x9Baa2a255282C7c71321488626293Fe8737Fb8ef?network=mainnet)", "timestamp": 1625785983, "digest": "bDMST-9H2_2pXLHkO8b_1mCargJk56BGGFXEKBQtL8I", "contributor": "0x4303Ddc9943D862f2B205aF468a4A786c5137E76"}

Once it's cheap enough to casually mint NFTs, people will. This gives meme NFTs an additional utility as building blocks for other meme NFTs, just as template memes are building blocks for future memes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs it becomes easier and cheaper to mint NFTs, users can retain ownership, and buyers can speculate and commemorate the NFTs moving forward.\n\nMarketplaces will allow multilayered memes so that users can use existing memes or own memes while maintaining attributions and royalties. Once we have that infrastructure in place, one can make a meme from other memes and the metadata becomes platform agnostic. The economics play out in such a manner that users are incentivized to cite correctly.\n\nLastly, this will also incentivize creators to curate valuable memes in the context of their own platforms and across the web in order to participate in the reward association. Ultimately, it is a win-win, for curators, platforms, and fans that allow memes to evolve to a fully functioning economy.\n\n### Resources\n\n[NFTs & the Meme Economy | kabessa](https://app.yup.io/collections/nfts-%26-the-meme-economy/5iVSY6U)\n\n[NFT Projects | kabessa](https://app.yup.io/collections/nft-projects/rwsWItw)\n\n# NFT \n\n*If the address is verified, we pledge to transfer 15% of NFT revenue with the earliest known creator of the meme and user of the meme's template (as recognized by [knowyourmeme.com](http://knowyourmeme.com)), *[starwarsposting](https://twitter.com/starwarsposting/status/1384856874080690177).*\n\n# Tip\n[NFTs & the Meme Economy](split://0x9Baa2a255282C7c71321488626293Fe8737Fb8ef?network=mainnet)", "timestamp": 1625786646, "digest": "bDMST-9H2_2pXLHkO8b_1mCargJk56BGGFXEKBQtL8I", "contributor": "0x4303Ddc9943D862f2B205aF468a4A786c5137E76"}

Because the old models of fundraising are lacking. Traditionally, crowdfunding campaigns are the only way young artists like us can bring our visions to life. Art is essential: bringing people meaning, comfort, and community. But with the current infrastructure, art can be really difficult to make and share with the world: we’re often forced to put a lot of our own money, hard work and time into projects without compensation. Often, we have to sign away ownership of our creative vision to companies that hold our art and our creative rights hostage. It goes both ways, too: fans are just fans, and donors don’t get much in return for their financial contribution.\n\n[Dog Lover](crowdfund://0x7265b48eBF05d83bfB97C5fc341E4eBBFd1b53C0?version=tiered_1&network=rinkeby&features=overview)\n\nWith this experiment in a crypto-funded model of filmmaking, we want to pave the way for change. We want models of direct ownership of art: a future where there is a real connection between artists and their fans. We want you to have a stake in The Dog Lover. We want supporters who aren’t just supporters, but collaborators. By participating, you’re co-creating that future with us. You’re coming on to our creative team and gaining a behind-the-scenes look into what it takes to make films happen. Together with you, we will take The Dog Lover to through the festival circuit, where we anticipate it being a major contender.\n\nSupporters of The Dog Lover will be innovators: no other short films have been created this way in cinema history!\n\n### What’s The Dog Lover About?\nHow far would you go to be loved? What personal price would you pay? Would you change yourself into someone — or something — other than who you are?\n\nThese are the questions The Dog Lover asks, and that our main character, Walter, must answer.\n\nWhen Walter’s wife’s beloved dog Max dies, her grief is crushing. Walter works hard to fill the aching void in her heart, but nothing seems to please her. Walter soon discovers that he can win Sarah’s love by acting like her dog.\n\nIt isn’t long before the couple begins to rekindle their romance through these strange circumstances. Things are looking up, until Walter realizes that this particular pathway to love is paved with all sorts of bizarre pitfalls. A little too bizarre, perhaps. It soon becomes clear to Walter that he must choose whether he’s willing to be his wife’s dog.\n\nThe Dog Lover is a weird, offbeat story with elements of dark comedy and horror. But it also has an emotional core that is deeply relatable: at one point or another, we’ve all had to decide if we’re going to be someone’s dog (so to speak) or risk loneliness. Needless to say, we don’t always make the right decision.\n\nCheck out the trailer below, cut from footage from the original short we made together during our first year at the American Film Institute Conservatory (the number one film school in the US according to the Hollywood Reporter). With this new version, we’re going to expand and perfect the story and utilize the skills we developed during our time at AFI.\n\nTRAILER\n\n## Meet the team\n\n### Director\n**ANNE-SOPHIE BINE**\nOf French and Polish background, Anne-Sophie Bine was raised in several different countries — which may be why she speaks five languages. A 2018 graduate of Stanford University, where she earned a BA in Comparative Literature, Art History and Creative Writing, she also holds an MA in Philosophy from the Sorbonne in Paris. She has worked directly with Academy Award winning Production Designer Rick Heinrichs on large film productions in London, LA and New Zealand (including the upcoming LORD OF THE RINGS TV show). Shown here holding her beloved bumbling pooch Leos, named after Leos Carax, one of her favorite Directors.\n\n### Producer\n**TARA AUSTIN**\nTara Austin broadened her production experience assisting Floria Sigismondi on music video and commercial productions in LA. She also served as 1st AD on the independent action feature THE BADGE, which led her to a position assisting the lead actor/producer on RIDDICK and FAST & FURIOUS 6. She went on to produce and direct several projects for her company Elkheart Films ranging from narrative and documentary shorts to fashion films, music videos and commercials. A graduate of UC Santa Barbara, where she majored in Film Studies, she also holds a masters degree in Film Studies from Concordia University in Montreal. Shown here holding a stuffed dog. Someone had to do it.\n\n### Screenwriter\n**ARI JACOBSON**\nAri Jacobson was inspired to pursue screenwriting while working on several major productions, including as assistant to director Paul Feig on GHOSTBUSTERS (2016). He then fed his creative streak working nights as a bartender in Brooklyn, NY. Ari's credits also include writing sketch comedy at Upright Citizens Brigade NYC and creating online content for Discovery Communications. Previously, Ari was co-owner of a film production company, for which he wrote/produced several projects, including a music video with 345 million views. A graduate of American University with a BA in Film and Media Arts, Ari also studied at FAMU in Prague. Shown here holding his three legged friend Xena, a rescue from a kill shelter in Korea, now living her best life in California.\n\n### Editor\n**TIANZE “EDWARD” SUN**\nTianze \"Edward\" Sun is a recent graduate of Loyola Marymount University with a BA in screenwriting. He has worked at Indigo Light as a script writer and editor for music videos, developing young EDM artists. Edward loves to be on set and has been actively working with film students in Southern California, including students from USC, LMU, etc. He has experience in various major positions on film sets and is now utilizing his skills to tell stories through the craft of editing. Shown here holding Maybelline, a friend’s husky. All it took was one bat of her lashes to win over Edward (maybe she’s born with it?)\n\n### Cinematographer\n**NATHAN PODSHADLEY**\nNathan Podshadley is a California-born cinematographer. After graduating from Loyola Marymount University, he spent six years working in New York under the guidance of renowned photographer Mark Seliger as both his lighting director and DP. With a background in documentary and stills, he began transitioning to shooting narrative work with the interactive short HOLY NIGHT in 2018. The project was shown at both the Tribeca and New York Film Festivals in 2019. Shown here holding Bobo, who, as you will see from the photo, shares one soul with Nathan.\n\n### Production designer\n**JOSE HERRERA**\nArchitect and interior designer Jose Herrera is originally from Venezuela. He’s brought his passion for design to LA, where has served as a production designer on several productions, as well as being an Art Director, Set Decorator, and Prop Master. He also has extensive experience working on high-end residential, commercial and hospitality projects. A graduate of the South American Architectural Sciences School, he holds California Architects Board Examination/Licensing Credential Certification in Science and Civil Engineering and is well versed in ADA and OSHA standards. Shown here holding Ben. Ben is a good dude.

While the content and framing has evolved over the past 6 months, the core vision has remained the same: to craft a crypto-native artifact that captures the humanity of the people building the future of Ethereum.\n\nIt contains the hopes, fears, and anticipations of the Eth2 researchers and client implementers directly responsible for bringing the Beacon Chain to life on December 1, 2020. The future of the Beacon Chain is the future of Ethereum, and we’re proud to tell part of its story this far.\n\nWe prompted contributors with a few questions - you'll find them in order in each response, some but not all answered.\n\n- Name / handle\n- Affiliated orgs\n- Primary role\n- Eth2 rough start date\n- General summary of experiences\n- Code or documentation they are particularly proud of\n- Most memorable or painful-to-discover Eth2 bug\n- Person you've come to admire or want to give a shoutout to\n\nKeep in mind that these responses were gathered both before and after the Beacon Chain launch, so references to launch expectations will vary. Profiles are ordered alphabetically by first name.\n\nFinally, while we made the utmost effort to include as many people as possible, it’s inevitable that we missed or were unable to feature some contributors. Eth2 wouldn’t be what it is without the input of hundreds of community testers and code contributors - thank you.\n\n---\n\n### Ethereum = Eth1 + Eth2\n\n- Ben Edgington\n- Originally [published on eth2.news](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/wnie2_210328), 28th March, 2021\n\nLet's start with a quick history of what's become known as Eth2, and where it's headed in the future.\n\nRecently, Danny Ryan has announced his [intent to deprecate](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/11/finalized-no-23/) the use of the terms eth1 and eth2. As the creator and curator of “What’s New in Eth2,” this is a bit of a blow!\n\nBut, on the whole, I agree that these terms are beginning to outlive their usefulness, and are in danger of becoming quite misleading. It’s not really about fiddling with names; it’s about capturing fundamental changes in direction, and communicating them clearly. Changes in the roadmap are confusing for the community. Clarity in naming aids clarity of understanding.\n\nHere's a brief history of naming things in Ethereum’s roadmap.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the first use of the name “Ethereum 2” was by Vitalik in Hacker News, way back in [April 2014](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7554923). He positioned Ethereum 2 as being a future step-change in the capability of Ethereum through the use of “fundamental cryptographic upgrades.”\n\nEthereum 2 then drops out of view, and the main narrative becomes the familiar Frontier → Homestead → Metropolis → Serenity progression, first described in [March 2015](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/). In this scheme, Serenity is the network upgrade to Proof of Stake; Serenity isn’t Ethereum 2 per se. Interestingly, sharding/scaling doesn’t have a clear place in that roadmap, although it was certainly discussed [around that time](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/04/05/blockchain-scalability-chain-fibers-redux/).\n\nProgress largely followed this plan for some years, with Homestead going live in March 2016, and Metropolis (in name at least) in a pair of upgrades in October 2017 and February 2019.\n\nSerenity was to have been delivered via a process of upgrading the existing Ethereum chain to bootstrap Proof of Stake. That upgrade was specified in [EIP-1011](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1011.md) and there was even a [testnet](https://hackmd.io/@aTTDQ4GiRVyyce6trnsfpg/Hk6UiFU7z?type=view) that went live on December 31st, 2017.\n\nHowever, the road to Serenity was found to be a dead-end, not least because of the vast amount of Ether that stakers would require - 1500 was the number back then.\n\nSo, in mid 2018, we tore up that roadmap and started afresh with Ethereum 2.0. Rather, we reverted to Vitalik’s original idea from 2014 of an Ethereum 2 that was to be a significant cryptographic step-change to the protocol. Calling this Eth 2.0 made sense: we were planning to change pretty much everything about the platform. Ethereum 1 would eventually be brought in as a kind of legacy system. This Ethereum 2.0 roadmap came with neat consecutive phases: Phase 0 for Proof of Stake; Phase 1 for data shards; Phase 2 for executable shards; and, finally, bring Eth1 over to Eth2 after all that.\n\nWe’ve now delivered Phase 0, but the rest of the plan has evolved. As per the latest Eth2 pages [on the ethereum.org website](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/), “Eth2 [now] refers to a *set of interconnected upgrades* that will make Ethereum more scalable, more secure, and more sustainable” (emphasis mine). This looks much more like the old Serenity plan! We’re upgrading the Ethereum chain in-place rather than doing the old rip-and-replace.\n\nSo, you see, the roadmap narrative has vacillated over the years between effectively doing a replacement of Ethereum 1, referred to at various times as Eth2, and doing in-place upgrades to Eth1. Today, we’re more or less back in upgrade territory.\n\nIn view of all this, applying the Ethereum 2.0 moniker to the entire project is now seen as confusing: to some it implies a different chain to today’s Ethereum; to others, even [a different coin](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/md75k2/will_be_eth_20_a_new_coin_or_will_be_the_same_eth/). It suggests incompatibilities and problems ahead.\n\nThe [latest naming trend](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/11/finalized-no-23/), then, is to limit Eth2 to refer only to the consensus layer upgrade of Ethereum to Proof of Stake, and to refer to all of today’s Ethereum (fka Eth1) as the execution layer.\n\nIt's good to see everything moving under a consistent terminology and a shared roadmap. I'm looking forward to a productive rest of 2021 and beyond!\n\n[Continuations [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=26)\n\n### Aditya Asgaonkar\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- 2019 \n\nEth2 promises to deliver a decentralized, scalable, and secure blockchain platform on which stateful applications can live. These three qualities will be the driving force towards the mass adoption of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn the quest to satisfy the design requirements, we've also seen some amazing research and engineering progress. We have pushed the frontier of computer science in areas such as Byzantine consensus, signature aggregation, and VDFs. With the launch of Phase 0, we created the largest BFT consensus network in existence, which is an awesome feat in itself!\n\nMy favorite bit of work was the [\"Weak Subjectivity Guide\"](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/weak-subjectivity.md) - a document that outlines the weak subjectivity safety features of the Eth2.0 network. The goal is to prevent long range attacks that appear specifically in PoS consensus.\n\nAs for favorite bug, there was a consensus (fork-choice) issue discovered right before the Beacon Chain launch. The first priority was to assess the threat level of the attack -- it was critical and could have lead to a large-scale failure, but was extremely difficult to execute. Fixing this attack vector required a comprehensive review of the fork-choice component, and we had already identified a couple of solutions. At the end, there was agreement among the spec team that the attack didn't pose a critical threat because of its difficult execution, and we decided to publish a fix after further review was completed.\n\n### Adrian Manning\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Co-Lead Developer\n- Aug 2018 \n\nThe project has always been ambitious. The early designs were well thought out, but had shortcomings which became apparent when realising them through implementation. The collaboration between researchers and developers constantly iterated on these design specs for years, finally achieving a workable version of the original concept. The process was longer than expected, but it's been amazing to see the coordination and what has been achieved by a globally distributed group of implementers and researchers.\n\nOf all the work put into the Lighthouse client, I've changed and modified various architectures and designs and I'll likely continue to do so. I'm therefore not particularly fond of any individual piece relative to another. But I'm very proud of the end result. The resulting Lighthouse code-base that came together from everyone's hard work is what I'm most proud of.\n\nAs for person to give a shoutout to, I'm sure everyone has a similar answer, but for me it's Danny and Proto. Danny for the amazing organisational role and interfacing with all the client teams (especially on contentious topics) has sped up the development immensely. Proto (Diederick) for his relentless troubleshooting, bug-finding and research endeavours. He has been invaluable in interop testing, optimisation improvements and all round improving the general state of all clients and the eth2 ecosystem in general.\n\nAlso - there's an Australian saying, which I think applies to all eth2 researchers and developers: We're not here to f$!k spiders!\n\n### Adrian Sutton\n\n- Teku  \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2018 \n\nEth2 is this big idea that started as a seed right back when Ethereum began and then went on this crazy, messy, long journey as the details were thrashed out through open research and public collaboration. All that messiness and the length of the journey is a result of this unique, highly collaborative and distributed approach to designing it. Multiple times, concepts that had been thought settled were thrown out because a better idea came along. While that has been frustrating for on-lookers, it has led to and continues to lead to huge improvements in the resulting technology.\n\nThe interop lock-in in Canada was a major turning point in the progress of Phase 0. It forced the Beacon Chain out of that research mode. Suddenly, client development was less about translating the Python spec to another language and more about engineering all the other components that make a client actually usable. Client teams finally had a stable platform to work from and make clients interoperable. There was an explosion of tools to aid developers in debugging and testing across clients. The Beacon Chain had stopped being a research project and started being an engineering one. The road to Mainnet started to become clear.\n\nNow with the deposit contract launched and deposits flowing into it, the pressure to deliver the rest of Eth2 really amps up. Community pressure to unlock those funds again will become overwhelming and despite all the warnings that it won't be quick, people will be disappointed at how long it takes. But those locked funds will also be the equivalent of the interop lock-in, forcing work out of the research phase and into production. All that time spent researching led people to wonder if Eth2 will ever ship, but with the beacon chain launch and all that money locked in, Eth2 has almost unstoppable momentum.\n\nThe future of Ethereum is very bright.\n\nI'm quite proud of my blog post explaining the weak subjectivity period: [\"Exploring Ethereum 2: Weak Subjectivity Period.\"](https://www.symphonious.net/2019/11/27/exploring-ethereum-2-weak-subjectivity-period/) It was just me trying to get my head around a concept everyone seemed to be very hand-wavy about and put off solving to the future, yet it's become one of the standard reference points to explain the concept.\n\nI'm proud to have worked with Meredith Baxter and Cem Ozer. They have both been doing all the heavy lifting for Teku, almost entirely behind the scenes. They aren't flashy Twitter personalities, they just put their heads down and do the work.\n\nA few anecdotes to conclude: \n\n1. Family commitments mean I don't travel much, so when the first 7-client interop happened and a photo was posted of people crowded around the computer watching it, everyone in the photo was quickly identified but no one had any clue who I was. For a little while I was just \"that random guy in all the eth2 photos\".\n2. Before Ethereum, Ben Edgington only ever wore button-up, collared shirts. He's now exclusively dressed in Ethereum related T-shirts and has even picked up a penchant for Ethereum hoodies.\n\n[Caravans [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=27)\n\n### Afri Schoedon\n\n- Byzantine Fault / ESP Grantee  \n- Testnet Engineer\n- June 2018 \n\nI was working at Parity Technologies in 2018 which managed to implement EIP 1011, the \"Hybrid Casper FFG\" in the Parity Ethereum client. It was a hybrid proof-of-stake approach to the consensus engine and literally my first memory of seeing anything Eth2 related actually being implemented and run. There was Casper testnet up and running with Harmony, Pythereum, and Parity. It was exciting to see the idea of \"Serenity\" starting to materialize. \n\nHowever, it was the same year (only a few weeks later) that the Berlin Eth2 workshop decided to completely discard the hybrid Casper ideas in favor of the beacon chain. Admittedly, it was a massive undertaking. After all the ideation and the first implementations and testnets, we basically started from scratch. \n\nPrysmatic Labs first caught my attention when they launched their first public beacon chain testnets at the end of 2019. I was wondering why we had seven Eth2 clients but none of them was able to synchronize to the other clients' testnets. I was hooked and reached out to the Ethereum Foundation and the Goerli Initiative about contributing to multi-client testnets. And that's what I did in 2020, testnet after testnet up to the mainnet launch.\n\nWhen we launched the Goerli testnet in January 2019, it was not only an important milestone for Eth1 but it was also the perfect chance for Eth2 client teams to use this for their Eth1 integration leading up to the beacon chain genesis. Prysmatic Labs seized this moment and deployed all their Eth2 testnets to date to the Goerli testnet. Coindesk wrote a feature story with the headline [\"A New Test Network Just Activated and Ethereum 2.0 Will Be Using It.\"](https://www.coindesk.com/testnet-gorli-ethereum-serenity)\n\nAll my work on Eth2 concluded with the Eth2 mainnet launch in December 2020. The eight multi-client testnets are well documented on Github and received quite some [media attention](https://github.com/goerli/medalla).\n\nAs for bugs or missing features, that would be the lack of [BLS signature verifications](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/2081) in the deposit contract.\n\nShoutout to Hsiao-Wei Wang!\n\n### Alex Stokes\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- 2018 \n\nWhat a ride it has been! The launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020 represents the culmination of years of research and development across countless contributors from every corner of the globe, reaching as far back as the Ethereum genesis block.\n\nIt has been exhilarating to watch this effort go from a collection of wild ideas (e.g. informal talks on Casper from Devcon 3) to today’s production-scale mainnet. Having been involved before the “casper + sharding” merge and the formation of the eth2 umbrella, I have seen time and again how a dedicated group of individuals adapts and responds to changes both inside and outside the community. It is this resilience that I find most exciting, and that gives me confidence in a very bright future for Ethereum.\n\nWe are ready to weather whatever challenges may come our way and I cannot wait as we deploy a scalable Ethereum in 2021 and beyond.\n\nI'll highlight [some of the early Casper work](https://github.com/ethereum/casper/pull/143) that got me involved directly with eth2 in mid-2018. Part of the original proof-of-stake design involved a validator registry contract hosted on the eth1 chain. As part of the deposit process, validators provided an arbitrary smart contract for signature verification. While an interesting application of account abstraction, this smart contract needed to be deterministic so that signatures could be independently verified on-chain. In order to ensure the smart contract had the desired properties, it was processed by another smart contract, the \"purity checker\" (in the sense of a pure computation), during the initial registration.\n\nAn early version of the purity checker was written in a now deprecated smart contract language called Serpent LLL. I created a Gitcoin bounty to port the Serpent LLL to a language stack used in the ethereum/casper project, Vyper LLL.\n\nMost painful bug would definitely have to be debugging cross-client interactions during the eth2 interop event in 2019. Fun times, good people and challenging bugs!\n\nShoutout to protolambda!\n\n### Alex Vlasov\n\n- TX/RX  \n- Applied Researcher\n- July 2019 \n\nMy predominant impression is that Eth2 poses problems, which are perhaps the most challenging from a software engineering point of view, at the moment. This is exciting from a researcher's perspective, but sometimes frustrating from a software engineer's one. We must adapt, in order to survive in the endeavor.\n\nOne aspect is that we, as software engineers, are used to optimizing for the common case, largely overlooking rare ones. But the latter ones are exactly what an attacker will thoroughly scrutinize! The habit is difficult to break, especially considering that it demands huge amounts of time to analyze and optimize the worst case behavior.\n\nI'm confident that we have to use Formal Methods, as testing is not able to explore the search space exhaustively (except for rare cases, when the space is relatively small).\n\nAnother important aspect is that modern DeFi is demanding on resources. And that is not only data throughput, but EVM/CPU throughput too. ZKP/zkRollups is an obvious example. However, asset pricing can be computation hungry too. And, as we can see now, DeFi asset pricing is an important topic. Unfortunately, EWASM turned to be a much harder idea to implement than initially expected. And it's basically for the same reason - WASM JIT compilers are optimized for a common case, while worst case scenarios can be exploited by an attacker. So, I treat it as another manifestation of the problem discussed above.\n\nWhile the problems are difficult, I am very excited to investigate and implement potential solutions.\n\nOne idea that I'm working on is a (semi-)automated transpilation of Eth2 beacon chain Python specs to Kotlin. The [resulting Kotlin code](https://github.com/ericsson49/research/blob/master/beacon_kotlin_generated/src/phase1/spec.kt) is beautiful, IMHO. Kotlin turned to be a pretty good match for (a statically-typed subset of) Python.\t\n\nAs for a specific bug, it's not yet made public (as it can turn to be a serious vulnerability). But the basic idea is that swapping two lines leaves a function 100% functionally correct, while an attacker can send the code into a practically endless loop.\n\nShoutout to Danny Ryan!\n\n[Discovery [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=28)\n\n### Ben Edgington\n\n- Teku  \n- Chronicler of Eth2 and Teku PM\n- January 2018 \n\nI could write a book on this, and perhaps one day I will. But the tl;dr is that getting to where we are has been the most incredible journey of my career.\n\nThe technology is thrilling, and the distributed development model no less so. But the highlight above all is getting to work every day with such a brilliant, thoughtful, capable, and generous group of people. If it's true that technology reflects the people who build it, then Eth2 is going to be a superb foundation for all the systems of the world.\n\nAs for the future, the beacon chain was designed, developed and delivered astonishingly quickly, having been conceived only in June 2018. Things get harder from now on: the beacon chain already carries so much value, and we need to begin taking into account the existing value on the Eth1 chain as we work on a merge. I think our main challenges ahead may not be technical, but more governance related. But I am confident that, with the ethos we've established and momentum we have as a community, we can bring this thing to a successful conclusion.\t\n\nI've enjoyed writing up regular digests of the latest developments in the spec since October 2018 at [eth2.news](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/), really with an audience of just the other Eth2 devs in mind. Over time it's grown and evolved, and now gets between three thousand and ten thousand views per edition. This amazes me.\n\nI am still happy with my one and only ethresear.ch post, co-written with Nicolas Liochon: [\"Exploring the Proposer Collator split.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/exploring-the-proposer-collator-split/1632) While more of a design bug than a code bug, some credited it with finally finishing off the old sharding design, and precipitating the move to the beacon chain. I think things may have already been heading in that direction at the time.\n\nAs for individual shoutouts, what an incredible group of people - you are all amazing!\n\n### Carl Beekhuizen\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- April 2018 \n\nAlthough eth2 has taken longer to get off the ground than I think any of us imagined, the result is extremely robust, secure, and decentralised.\n\nIt is incredibly exciting to see how eth2 is evolving and maturing into the backbone of the decentralised future we all dream about.\n\nI'm most proud of the key-derivation EIPs (2333, 2334, 2335). Specifically, the quantum-secure backup keys built into EIP 2333. In the event of a quantum apocalypse, validators should be able to recover using these Lamport signatures.\n\nI'm also really proud of the Launchpad. 🦏 So many validators managed to deposit safely.\n\nSpecial shoutout to Hsiao-Wei Wang for the attention to detail and diligence she brings to everything she works on.\n\n### Cayman Nava\n\n- Chainsafe Systems  \n- Client Implementer\n- December 2018 \n\nThe past two years have been a blast. Looking back on the progress we've collectively made and the state of the ecosystem, I feel like we're on the cusp of something great. And I'm honored to be a part of it. I anticipate that Ethereum will be of critical importance for the future, as a rock-solid foundation that empowers ultimately successful experiments which aim to resolve many of the hardest problems facing society today.\n\nI'm proud of the [typescript implementation](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ssz) of SSZ (a copy of Proto's remerkleable). It fulfills the spec, but in an ergonomic way. You can operate on an ssz merkle tree as if it is a 'normal' javascript object. This required some exotic code, but the result is seamless [ssz <-> javascript interoperability](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/lodestar-medalla-update-59865a5cce1a).\n\nHuge thanks to Proto and his work! Many of the tools / algorithms / methods he's published are present in Lodestar: remerkleable, eth2-fastspec, protoarray fork choice, etc. the list goes on.\n\n### Celeste Seberras\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Technical Content Strategist\n- May 2018 \n\nIt has been a humbling experience to have witnessed the growth of Prysmatic from a small seedling with a dream to the robust and diverse community it harbours today; equally so for the broader Eth2 ecosystem. Hard work over the past two years has proven that, through all the speculative noise and interindustry drama, the things that truly speak are code and passion.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the Prysm client usage manual.\n\nShout out to all the boys here at Prysmatic Labs. You are all fantastic to work with, here's to the future!\n\nShoot for the stars. Even if you miss, holy fuck you're in space!\n\n### Cem Ozer\n\n- Teku  \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2019 \n\nI’m blown away that the Eth2.0 beacon chain is now alive and well. For me it was such a complex undertaking, and deep down I was scared it would never launch or be successful.\t\n\nWhen I first joined Teku (called Artemis back then) we were almost only working on the state transition. The spec changed pretty rapidly at the time, and as a result we had to update our state transition many times. I found myself leading these changes at Artemis, and it would almost always be a week long intense marathon where we’d change thousands of lines of code as a team, and I’d try to make sure we did not break anything.\n\nLuckily this was in the prototyping phase, this is not how it’s done today in the production phase :). I’m also pretty proud of having worked on the Eth1 Deposit Management of Teku.\n\nMy best bug discovery is luckily documented by my team lead Adrian Sutton on his blog: [\"The Curious Case of the Invisible Fork.\"](https://www.symphonious.net/2020/07/06/exploring-ethereum-2-the-curious-case-of-the-invisible-fork/)\n\nShoutout to Johnny Rhea, Adrian Sutton, and Protolambda. These three people are all geniuses in their own unique ways. It was an honor and an incredible experience working with them.\n\n[Build - Maintain [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=29)\n\n### Chih Cheng Liang\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Client Implementer\n- November 2017 \n\nI'm glad to be part of Eth2 development. There are too many people; I can't express my gratitude enough. There are lots of beautiful memories that I'll cherish forever.\n\nI'm excited to see what Ethereum will be with fully-fledged PoS as well as sharding.\n\nI'm most proud of introducing the Milagro BLS binding to Trinity. BLS signatures are like the steroids of Eth2. Back then, only one Python library, py_ecc, met the requirements of the Beacon Chain spec. py_ecc is great for research or education purposes, but for things like client implementations, the performance of the library is not on par. The naïve alternative is to find a Python binding of a fast language. Chia's Python binding to C++ code was the low hanging fruit to pursue.\n\nAs the Beacon Chain BLS requirements became more specific, and we had to interop with other clients in a short timeframe, we decided to try using Python to wrap \"milagro_bls\" - Sigma Prime's Rust library. The result is the \"milagro_bls_binding\" library. I'm proud of it because that's my first Rust-ish project, and it was used in a real use case.\n\nAs for most challenging bug, in early 2018 I worked on the [Casper prototype testnet](https://github.com/ethereum/trinity/pull/954) that Karl and Vitalik built on pyethapp. Pyethapp had many issues, but the most difficult one to debug was the peer connection issue. I got a lot of help from Dmitry from the Harmony team, he discovered many peer connection issues with the Java client's logs. One of them was pyethapp's catastrophic peer-to-peer bug.\n\nSpecial thanks to Jannik Luhn - he contributed lots of quality work in peer to peer research/simulation and Trinity.\n\n### Dankrad Feist\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- June 2018 \n\nBy historical accident, one of my first ever involvements with Ethereum was the research workshop in Berlin 2018 where the Beacon chain design (and merging of Casper and Sharding) was first decided. I had only come to the workshop because I was in Berlin at the time for my startup and my former colleague and friend, Justin Drake, had invited me to check it out. The concepts that were talked about at this workshop immediately appealed to the nerd inside me -- deep maths and computer science problems, nevertheless approachable and worth exploring to find elegant solutions. \n\nOver the next few months, I tried my luck on some of the problems that were discussed, especially the randomness problem. However, it would only be March 2019 that I left my startup and went to work on Ethereum 2.0 full time, so I would say that the concept of the beacon chain was by then fairly mature and what was left to be done was more tinkering around the edges.\n\nI think it is always worth reminding ourselves that the beacon chain itself, while only one part of Eth2.0, is a very ambitious project. As far as I am aware, Proof of Stake has never been tried on this scale: neither economically nor in the networking sense. What I mean by this is the sheer amount of funds that can be staked on the beacon chain, which due to the Ether market cap can easily approach billions of dollars in value. This is one advantage smaller projects certainly do have over Ethereum -- they can increase stake gradually, whereas Eth2.0 will very quickly go all the way.\n\nNot only that, but most other projects have refrained from actually imposing penalties on validators -- which compromises the security of PoS networks, but obviously makes designing it much easier, because literally nothing is at stake except for some very minor rewards.\n\nFinally, and this is the most important distinction, Eth2.0 is designed so that it can literally accommodate a million validators. That's pretty impressive considering that most other projects only support around 100! Not only that, but this feat is achievable using fairly modest node requirements, in fact it seems perfectly plausible to run a validator on a mobile phone or a Raspberry Pi.\n\nWhen we do launch the beacon chain, which is now truly imminent (barring extreme surprises), we should keep in mind just how ambitious this project is even on its own. \n\nThe beacon chain was essentially frozen 3 months after I joined the team full time, so I would not claim that I have made any major contributions to it. My most important contribution to Eth2.0 that is slated for inclusion so far is re-architecting the Proof of Custody construction so that it is fully suitable for SSVs (Secret Shared Validators). While we weren't too sure of the experimental cryptographic Legendre pseudo-random function (PRF) when we first came across it in March 2019, it has successively improved to a truly impressive construction on all fronts that I am now very proud of:\n\n1. Extended cryptoanalysis has improved our confidence in the Legendre PRF a lot in response to several bounties that we have set out.\n2. The combination of the Legendre PRF with the Universal Hash Function primitive, suggested by Dmitry Khovratovich, means that only a single evaluation of the PRF is needed per proof of custody, and the rest of the computation is extremely efficient and even faster than regular (sha256) hashing.\n3. Thanks to the probabilistic 0.01 bit proof of custody idea, only a small amount of information is leaked from the proof of custody, such that it would be impossible to gain access to custody secrets even if the Legendre PRF were broken outright.\n\nFinally, I have huge respect for Danny Ryan. He is phenomenal at keeping everything together and making it work.\n\n### Danny Ryan\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- 2017 \n\nSurprise! Everything is a bit harder than originally expected (at least from my perspective) - I suppose most of the things worth doing in life are. Today, I am very excited about the project and the progress. Eth2 has an incredibly strong technical background and is ready for the next wave of upgrades. Huge shout-out to the hard work from client teams, as well as to the validator community keeping this thing running.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the [beacon chain spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md).\n\nFinally, I don't want to imagine how this would have gone without protolambda's insight and technical contributions over the past couple of years.\n\n### Dmitriy Ryajov\n\n- Status  \n- libp2p developer\n- August 2019 \n\nSuper grueling, but rewarding in terms of overall impact on the different ecosystems, Eth2 itself, the Nim language and libp2p.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the Nim libp2p implementation.\n\n### Hsiao-Wei Wang\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- Summer 2017 \n\nMy journey started with implementing Serenity™. It was an ambitious and abstract concept. We've struggled with the design trade-offs for a long time, but with more and more contributors who devoted their efforts, and years of hard work, we were finally able to divide and conquer Eth2.\n\nIt was a fantastic journey to launch Phase 0 finally. I'm so grateful for the broad community support. And, of course, the Ethereum heroes who dove into Ethereum R&D.\n\nI'm very excited about the next Eth2 milestones and the creative ideas that the community will build on Eth2.\n\nI want to mention my admiration for Virgil Griffith, a pioneer that paved the way for Ethereum research work.\n\n[Seen and Seeing [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=30)\n\n### Ivan Martinez\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Engineer\n- August 2018 \n\nWorking on Eth2 has been an amazing adventure. It went from contributing in my free time to becoming my longest running full-time job. While there have been a few blocks on the way (unstable spec, implementation problems, testnet drama), it's been an absolute blast and this is just the start! Very excited to release, and move forward with future phases!\n\nI am particularly proud of building our [end-to-end testing suite](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/3932), which has proved incredibly useful for detecting issues before changes reach the canary. I've also helped build a lot of the [slasher](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/5043) and optimized it for mainnet usage.\n\nOne of the most memorable bugs I encountered would have to be: [\"Change StreamIndexedAttestations to use target root for state regen #5971.\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/5971)\n\nShoutout to Terence Tsao! His ability to understand the spec has constantly amazed me (he's the largest contributor to the spec outside of the EF!).\n\nAlso.. Danny Ryan is awesome :)\n\n### Jacek Sieka\n\n- Status  \n- Research Lead\n- March 2018 \n\nI was fortunate to join Eth2 at the very start - having worked on many open source projects before, for fun, peer-to-peer networks like DC++, compilers like nlvm, as well as high-frequency trading. It all came together at that point like a perfect fit - a giant stroke of good luck. Here we are, years later, with the baby well on its way to being delivered.\n\nThe work I'm most proud of is managing to restore sanity and switching [Eth2 to Little Endian](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/139). It survived several high-profile attempts to swing it back to Big. I guess a more memorable, and certainly more involved feature, was the deep collaboration on the networking protocol that culminated with [what we have today](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/1328) - this was quite the achievement made possible by some round-the-world collaboration with Adrian (of Sigma Prime), Raúl (of libp2p) and lots of others! Less known is that me and Adrian resorted to flipping an Ethereum block hash coin to see who would get to post the PR :)\n\nI'm most proud of when Paul Hauner and I managed to run a fully independent, self-sufficient [multi-client Eth2 network](https://twitter.com/jcksie/status/1171886857908609024) for the first time, at the Canada retreat!\n\n### Jonny Rhea\n\n- Teku, TX/RX  \n- Client lead & TX/RX co-founder\n- November 2018 \n\n\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.\"\n\nParticularly proud of my Ethresearch post, [\"Packetology: Validator \nPrivacy.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/packetology-validator-privacy/7547) \n\nMost memorable bug: [\"DoS Attack on Prysm Stops Finality.\"](https://github.com/ethereum/public-attacknets/issues/12)\n\nShoutout to the Russians! (former Harmony team) “You know that if we don't pull this off we are fired, right?” Joe Delong to me before the interop lock-in.\n\n### Joseph Delong\n\n- Teku  \n- Client Implementer, Researcher\n- December 2018 \n\nI hope we can move from the Beacon Chain to a practical implementation as fast as possible. Most proud of my implementation of the deposit tree logic in Teku. Toughest bug was getting the \"is_valid_merkle_branch\" method working in Teku.\n\nShoutout to Jonny Rhea & Mikhail!\n\n### JosephC \n\n- ConsenSys  \n- R&D\n- January 2019 \n\nThe Beacon Chain launch is like Project Mercury: getting into space/orbit. The equivalents of Project Gemini and Project Apollo are needed next. Rollups and Layer 2 will help improve scalability, but I believe there is much innovation that can and should continue to be done in Layer 1. There is a place for some execution, and cross-shard transactions in Layer 1. I also think that we should be careful about assumptions that we might make, like assuming that cross-shard transactions must be asynchronous. The challenges in the Ethresearch thread [“Cross-shard DeFi composability”](https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-shard-defi-composability/6268/9) need tackling with minimal assumptions.\n\nI dream of a system that is more scalable, performant, but preserves the default atomicity and synchronicity of Ethereum. I dream of shards that are transparent and automatically load-balancing. It may sound impossible, but can be used to inspire the engineers of the world to build the ambitious system that we can envision.\n\nDevelopments like Apollo and the Internet are an encouraging reminder to what humanity can accomplish: where there's a will, there's a way.\n\nWhy is this important? Why is a platform for decentralized systems important? John Perry Barlow may have answered it with his [“Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace.”](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence)\n\nPersonally, I'm delighted that [\"The Beacon Chain Ethereum 2.0 explainer you need to read first\"](https://ethos.dev/beacon-chain/) is usually on the first page of Google for \"beacon chain.\" I'm most proud of forming and recruiting a talented R&D group at ConsenSys that has made numerous Ethereum contributions. For Eth2, these include a review of the deposit contract and influencing an important Solidity implementation. More well known is the Quilt team, which started from R&D of Eth2 Phase 2 (execution, threads [quilting], rather than Plasma). Finally, years ago I helped connect Karl Floersch to the Casper \"team\" at EDCON Paris.\n\nShoutout to all of Ethereum Layer 0 -- its people -- without which there would be no Layer 1 or beyond. Layer 0 always welcomes you, and all contributions great and small :)\n\n### Justin Drake\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- Late 2017 \n\nLooking back, the beacon chain took longer than expected to ship and there is significant work remaining in the coming years. Having said that, I am incredibly optimistic and excited about the future of Ethereum—I could not be more bullish :)\n\nI'm pretty proud of the fact that the beacon chain spec is executable - it's pretty remarkable IMO. How many complex internet protocols have a full executable spec, not to mention four production-grade implementations on day 1?\t\n\nOne of the \"design bugs\" I was involved with early on was having PoS and sharding be separate cryptoeconomic systems as opposed to one unified design. Another big design flaw was using plain (as opposed to aggregatable) signatures. Looking back, in ~2 years we took a visionary but very rough design and made it orders of magnitude better.\n\nFolks dedicated to Eth2 are a rare breed (less than 100 of us) and I have tremendous respect for the team as a whole, as well as many individuals. I will note that, with where things are headed, we may soon have trillions of dollars running on Eth2 and we will need more manpower. So I want to give a shoutout to you—the reader—to consider joining the Ethereum mission :) Hit me up by email, on Twitter, or on Telegram!\n\n[Traditions [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=31)\n\n### Karl Floersch\n\n- prev. Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- Winter 2017 \n\nIt has been a wild journey to scale Ethereum & we are ridiculously close to realizing the vision after all this time. It's pretty insane. I'm most proud of the early work I did on [Casper](https://github.com/ethereum/casper) and initial implementation of [Hybrid Casper](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/tree/b704a5c6577863edc539a1ec3d2620a443b950fb/ethereum/hybrid_casper). As for bugs, the pyethereum p2p layer was absolutely terrible and really crippled the testnet :'''(\n\nShoutout to Vitalik, Hsiao-Wei Wang, & Justin Drake!\n\n### Kirk Baird\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nIt's been a very busy two years; as only my second job working in IT, the learning curve has been massive. First and most importantly, my understanding of the core technologies around blockchains has matured from seeing them as a secure linked list to the complex beast they are. With the focus of my work being on integrating BLS into Lighthouse, a significant knowledge of pairing based cryptography was needed. The BLS signature scheme is far more complicated than the existing ECDSA used in Eth1. Luckily, there are a lot of good resources out there which explain how to progress from classical elliptic curve cryptography to pairing based cryptography.\n\nI was lucky enough to go to DevCon Osaka in 2019 which was an amazing experience! There were so many keen minds all meeting to relish and enjoy the progress Ethereum has made, but also to provide insights and ideas on how it will be improved and developed over the coming years. Japan itself is also an amazing place with so much to see, until we almost got stuck in a typhoon.\n\nI am most proud of the work done on [Milagro BLS](https://github.com/sigp/milagro_bls). This library was rough around the edges when I first inherited it, being a long way from the standardised signature scheme we have now.\n\nFinally, wanted to give a shoutout to Danny Ryan! The man is a weapon.\n\n### Mamy André-Ratsimbazafy\n\n- Status  \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2018 \n\nI remember reading the \"70% ready\" spec in july 2018, that was the wild wild west. Things were on a HackMD document, changes were made every 6 hours and very hard to track - as mentioned in the EthCC 2 talk [\"Tests and Simulations of Eth2.0.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c4mQg5L6Rs&t=597s)\n\nOne of the most significant milestones was when, out of nowhere, all 7 clients at the time were able to create a testnet back in September 2019 in Muskoka. Anticipation, apprehension, will the launch work? If yes, that is definitely a huge milestone!\n\nI'm proud of my work on the [\"Auditors Handbook to Nimbus Beacon Chain.\"](https://nimbus.guide/auditors-book/01_introduction.html) Nimbus uses a dark horse language called Nim. It happens to be easily picked up, and our 3 audit teams were pleasantly surprised by its features, including those related to correctness.\n\nThe most infamous bugs we had were related to fork choice / Proof-of-Stake. The most infamous one would be this one-liner hotfix, where some votes were skipped in period of non-finality: [\"hotfix fork choice score application #2041.\"](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/pull/2041/files)\n\nBig respect to Protolambda! He came like the Hagibis storm.\n\n### Matt Garnett \n\n- Quilt  \n- Researcher\n- January 2019 \n\nMy perspective on eth2 is probably very different from many people who were focused on Phase 0. Although I compartmentalized Phase 0 and Phase 1 to a large degree to allow myself to consider the possibilities of Phase 2, I never considered the possibility that eth2 wouldn't ship. To me, it was not a matter of \"if\" but \"when.\"\n\nI'm proud of the work I did writing the first Execution Environment for eth2, called [\"sheth.\"](https://github.com/quilt/sheth) It was completely stateless and allowed Ether transfers within a shard. \n\nShoutout to Proto, he has been instrumental in making eth2 happen, I don't know how he manages to be so prolific.\n\nA quick story to wrap up. On the first day of the Canada interop, the Quilt team drove up from Toronto in a 15-person passenger van. It had rained a bit so the area was sort of wet. The venue was tucked away off on a gravel road, right beside the lake. We pulled the van up next to the parked cars and headed in to visit with the eth2 teams. \n\nAfter catching up with everyone, we returned to the van to drive over to the airbnb we were sharing with the ewasm team. Will Villanueva had driven us there, so he hopped in the driver's seat and began orienting the van forwards to head out. The area we had parked in was sort of a T-intersection and there were small drop-offs (0.5m maybe) into a heavily wooded ditch anywhere there wasn't road. Will backed into one of the legs of the T and started to drive forward to leave. Unfortunately, the exit path was a rather steep gravel hill. The 2WD van didn't have the traction climb out and now we were positioned at an awkward angle in the T. The van was perilously close to tipping over into the ditch. Will backed up to a flatter part to regroup. I offered to give it a shot and he obliged. \n\nAt this point, we had drawn a bit of a crowd. I recall having people at each corner of the van, keeping an eye out to help avoid falling off into the ditch. I gave it a few attempts, but realized how difficult of a situation we were in. At this point, it was unclear if we could even return to our starting place, as the front left and back right of the van were less than a foot away from falling into the ditch - a ditch that would no doubt require a tow truck to collect the van from. There was no other option than making it up the hill. Fortunately, there was a bit of flatter ground between the van and the beginning of the hill. Although it would be a tight fit, likely inches on either side into the wooded ditch, I thought that with speed we should be able to build enough momentum to get past the steep portion of the hill. I shared my plan with the spectators. Unsurprisingly, the uninvested patrons were eager to fill me with confidence so they could enjoy the spectacle. I backed up the van as far as the gravel road would allow and then slammed the gas down. The van lurched forward, albeit lethargically, towards the top of the hill. The eth2 gods were almost certainly looking down on us in that moment and guided that van safely to the hill's peak. \n\nAt the top of the hill, I collected my emotions and then stepped out to enjoy the laughing and cheering. We inspected the ridiculous situation we had been in, and examined the ruts that the tires had made spinning out on the fail attempts. After the excitement died down and the spectators returned to the venue to continue working on their clients, we headed back up the hill to our van and drove home. \n\nFor the rest of the time there, we parked the van at the top of the hill and walked down to the venue.\n\n### Mehdi Zerouali\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Security Engineer, Cofounder\n- October 2018 \n\nI find it hard to believe that we're finally launching the beacon chain! So much hard work from so many different entities has gone into this over the past couple of years. I'm extremely proud of what Sigma Prime has accomplished so far and look forward to the Lighthouse crew making Phase 1, Phase 1.5 and Phase 2 a reality.\n\nThe structural differential fuzzer I've helped build as part of Beacon Fuzz is definitely something I'm proud of. Over the last few months, Beacon Fuzz helped uncover more than 40+ bugs on all major client implementations, including critical consensus related vulnerabilities.\n\nIt's hard to pick one person to recognize, but Diederik Loerakker (aka protolambda) has done such an amazing job helping the client teams navigate the optimisations required to implement the eth2 spec in production. Of course, the coordination job done by Danny Ryan is second to none. I doubt we'd be where we are today without these two exceptional individuals.\n\nFun fact: Lighthouse releases are named after Rick & Morty characters!\n\n### Meredith Baxter\n\n- Teku  \n- Client Implementer, Software Engineer\n- November 2019 \n\nI was fortunate to join the Teku team at an exciting time (about a year ahead of the beacon chain launch) in November of 2019. We had a lot of work ahead of us and we weren't sure whether or not we would meet launch deadline with a fully functional, production-ready client. The learning curve to understanding eth2 is also pretty steep, which only increased the pressure. Luckily, the EF and other eth2 client teams have been an incredible resource for us throughout the development process. The engineers involved across the client teams have been very open and supportive. And the EF researchers have been amazingly welcoming, approachable, and responsive. They've always been there for us to answer questions and provide insights. It has been hugely gratifying to be a part of the successful launch of the beacon chain with the help of this incredible group of people. I'm very excited to continue the work as we look forward to upcoming changes including our first hard fork, sharding, and the merge.\t\n\nOne exciting milestone was getting [Teku syncing to a live](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/1143) testnet (Prysm's Sapphire testnet).\n\nI'm also really proud of our [checkpoint sync feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz3flfj50Ig) which allows new nodes to sync up and become fully operational within minutes. See the issue as well: \"[Implement sync from a recent state #3063](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/issues/3063).\"\n\nThe instability on the Medalla testnet in the fall of 2020 was a trying moment across the client teams, but we came out stronger on the other side. We were all working overtime to improve performance and patch issues revealed by the long period of non-finalization. One big fix I managed to push during this time involved putting a hard limit on amount of work required to regenerate states that dropped out of our in-memory cache: [\"[Issue 2608] Add ability to periodically persist hot states #2611.\"](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/2611) More context on the network instability can be found here: [\"Eth2 Implementers’ Call #46 - 2020-08-20.\"](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/S1b2sJhzv)\n\n### Michael Sproul\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Client Implementer\n- March 2019 \n\nAfter a brief foray into the blockchain world in 2017, I developed a taste for it and knew I had to come back. When I saw a job ad from SigP on Twitter for a proof-of-stake client in Rust, I dropped what I was doing and got involved ASAP. At the beginning I got deep into Lighthouse's consensus code which was then very much in flux due to lots of spec changes, and had been written in a gargantuan solo effort by Paul! From that foothold in consensus I then branched out into the database, op pool and slashing -- all of which captured my interest in a way no other project had. \n\nWhen we ran the first testnets in September 2019 off code I'd contributed to, I was kind of shocked the thing worked at all, and awed by all the hard work done by everyone else involved. This community of researchers, programmers and enthusiasts has been nothing but amazing, and I'm optimistic for a successful Phase 0 launch and the realisation of the Eth2 dream in Phase 1 and beyond. Personally, I can't wait until we can run some transactions, and look forward to getting into the minutiae of WebAssembly execution environments.\t\n\nI'm very proud of Lighthouse's slasher. I was able to draw inspiration from great foundational research laid by Proto, and dedicate myself to building a fast, concise implementation. Testing the implementation on Medalla and watching the carnage inflicted on other validators brought a perverse form of satisfaction ;)\n\nOne of my favorite bugs: [\"DB inconsistent after restart #1488.\"](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/1488)\n\nShoutout to Cem Özer!\n\nI know of at least one core dev who force pushed a commit to master in the EthDenver bathrooms...\n\n### Mikhail Kalinin\n\n- PegaSys, TX/RX  \n- Applied Researcher\n- April 2018 \n\nIt's been exciting to see how Hybrid Casper FFG and the Sharding proposal have been merged into what is now called the Beacon Chain. And how this research is evolving, growing, attracting a lot of new people. And finally the result is about to be shipped pretty soon. This was a big part of my life for two and a half years. I anticipate rapid movement towards Shards and the Merge when Phase 0 is shipped. Though there are many things yet to deal with.\n\nI am proud of the [Eth1 Shard Demo](https://github.com/txrx-research/eth1-shard-demo) that we made together with Guillaume from EF with decent support from EF researchers.\n\nI can give recognition to a bunch of people tbh. But, narrowing down, Danny Ryan and Ben Edgington.\n\n### Nathaniel Jensen\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Security Engineer\n- September 2019 \n\nI'd heard a bit about Ethereum before but had not developed a solid understanding.\n\nAlthough relatively new, I'm glad to play a small part in such a technically impressive undertaking. I am continually appreciative that I can work in such an interesting space, with such friendly and impressive colleagues and community, and contribute to something that has the potential to be profoundly important. I'm excited to see Phase 0 mainnet kick off, the culmination of so much effort!\n\nI look forward seeing the space continue to develop with the incorporation of the EVM chain and Layer 2 solutions, and all the interesting use-cases that I can't begin to imagine.\n\nMy primary contribution to the Eth2 ecosystem had been taking on maintenance and development of a differential fuzzer that compares state transitions across the Eth2 clients: beacon-fuzz. In September 2019, Sigma Prime was engaged by the Ethereum Foundation to continue development of Guido Vranken's previous differential fuzzing solution - comparing ZRNT and Pyspec, the Go and Python Eth2.0 executable specifications.\n\nI was primarily responsible for building out [the fuzzing framework](https://github.com/sigp/beacon-fuzz) to include comparison of other client implementations: Lighthouse, Prysm, Nimbus, Teku, Trinity, as well as adding fuzzing targets for additional state transition functions.\n\nAs for most painful bug, see the [\"Beacon Fuzz update 001\"](https://blog.sigmaprime.io/beacon-fuzz-01.html) on the Sigma Prime blog, section \"Golang Library Linking Errors.\" How to try to get multiple Go implementations running without having their dependencies clash, and dealing with arcane linking issues using existing tooling to build a Go fuzzing library that exercises cgo/C code (as Prysm depends on a C/assembly BLS library).\n\nI want to give a shoutout to Protolambda (Diederik Loerakker). He reliably gets to the bottom of really obtuse fuzzing results. He's our consistent fallback for deciphering complicated results across multiple Eth2 client implementations. From our interactions, he clearly comes across as a friendly, genuine, and technically outstanding individual.\n\n### Nishant Das\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Client Implementer\n- June 2018 \n\nIt was a very difficult endeavour to get Eth2 running smoothly. Ultimately, with teams well distributed across the globe, constant communication is always a challenge. However, despite all that, I am really proud of the fact that we have launched Phase 0 with 4 different clients running. I'm very optimistic for the future and am looking forward to the merge. There have been too many bugs to count, and I keep on finding new ones every week.\n\nShoutout to Proto - cross client compatibility would be nowhere near what it is without him constantly monitoring and working on it.\n\n### Paul Hauner\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has fostered an inclusive, open, and merit-based approach to technical collaboration. Under this environment we've seen many researchers, engineers and communicators flourish. This is a testament to what people can do when they share a common goal and are empowered to work on the things that interest them.\n\nAs Eth2 has progressed, Sigma Prime has grown steadily to include a team of talented engineers and computer scientists. I am grateful to work with these people and I learn from them every day.\n\nI hope to see Ethereum evolve into a tool that provides honest utility to everyday people, without jeopardising the sovereignty of their data or selves.\n\nRegarding work I'm proud of, I quite like the [minimal-allocation Merkle-tree hasher](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/stable/consensus/tree_hash/src/merkle_hasher.rs) I built in 2018. It's simpler and more powerful than other algorithms I have seen.\n\nOne notable bug: [\"Manipulating deposit contract to gain an early majority #1446.\"](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1446)\n\n### Pawan Dhananjay\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2019 \n\nI remember reading Vitalik's proof of stake blog posts in early 2018 and thinking that it sounds all good in theory, but no way we'll have a proof of stake protocol for more than a small number of participants which would work well in practice. Needless to say, it's been extremely impressive to see how far the effort has come in just a few years. Kudos to everyone involved, I'm glad to have been a part of the effort for the past year.\n\nAlso, a huge shoutout to the SigP crew! It has been an absolute blast working with these guys, learning from them and also indulging in their jolly Aussie humor :) Excited for the Phase 0 launch and geared up to begin work on Phase 1!\n\nMost memorable bug would have to be: [\"Update state before producing attestation #1596.\"](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/1596)\n\nBig thanks to protolambda for sure. All his debugging tools have saved me (and many others I'm sure) hours of effort.\n\n### Preston Van Loon\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nThe last few years have been an adventure, to say the least. At first, I had just a mild interest in Ethereum. I didn't own any cryptocurrencies or really understand how they worked. After a few months of reading, I started to realize two things: 1) Ethereum was this incredible technology that has an unlimited potential to change the world for the better, and 2) Ethereum is incredibly slow and desperately needed to scale. \n\nImmediately, I looked for ways to help contribute to the scaling effort and then I met Raul Jordan. We met together in NYC for coffee and talked about starting a project to work on sharding for Ethereum. We formed Prysmatic Labs. Since starting the company in January of 2018, I've met some of the most interesting people in the world - many have become close friends. Working in Ethereum continues to fulfill my desire to make a positive impact, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing the completed roll out of Eth2.\n\nMost memorable bug would have to be that time that all of Prysm nodes thought they were 4 hours in the future and thousands of validators were slashed in a testnet: [\"Roughtime reports clock offset by 4hrs #6825.\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/6825)\n\n### Protolambda\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- November 2018 \n\nThe main theme is that we - researchers and client devs - did not make our lives easy. Spec updates have continued to improve the protocol itself, but caused instability in the process of updating implementations. A new network stack was adopted, and many difficult research and implementation problems had to be solved. In the future, I do not think this will change, as Phase 1 and later are complicated too. But the approach can be improved. Exploratory single-client implementation ahead of others could avoid duplicating work for other clients, and enable faster spec updates.\n\nMost memorable bug: [\"247120: encoding/binary: read at most MaxVarintLen64 bytes in ReadUvarint.\"](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/247120)\n\nShoutout to @Butta for his work on the beaconchain explorer.\n\n### Radosław Kapka\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Software Engineer\n- May 2020 \n\nWhat struck me most when I joined the project was the seemingly infinite amount of good will and patience from others when onboarding a new contributor. I really appreciate it. As for the future, I fail to see how Eth2 can not succeed when there are so many great people working on it.\n\nShoutout to the whole Prysmatic team! Everyone is so cool I can't just pick one person.\n\nI planned to visit Japan in the summer of 2020 and start learning Eth2 after coming back. The pandemic ruined my plans so I joined the Prysm project in May as a contributor. Three months later I got invited to be one of the core team members. Pretty cool, huh? I guess 2020 is not that bad after all.\n\n### Raul Jordan\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nWe went from being a bunch of hobbyists and volunteers interested in Ethereum's future, to having a ton of responsibility with a client being used by a large portion of stakers today. Core dev work was indistinguishable from magic to me before starting on this, and it honestly still is. However, I am fortunate to be surrounded by people much smarter than I am, and constantly learning how to write better code. Every day, we feel the weight of the work we do and we foresee it will only keep getting more important, as Phases 1 and 2 develop and eventually Ethereum will be powering world-scale transaction volume, likely using the code we wrote. At some point, the blockchain we are building might have multinational implications, and the hard work from the research team to make it as robust as possible is very encouraging. I could not be any happier with how far it’s come along, and we'll ship it.\n\nI am most proud of our [original eth2 API](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/ethereumapis). One day I was hanging out with Preston and Terence and we’re like “whoa! Etherscan built a block explorer using our API for eth2??” and then beaconcha.in popped up and it was honestly mind-blowing. We spent a lot of time putting it together and it contributed to the success of the Prysm client early on.\n\nOur most memorable bug would have to be the [Medalla Testnet Incident](https://medium.com/prysmatic-labs/eth2-medalla-testnet-incident-f7fbc3cc934a).\n\nI admire my team at Prysmatic Labs. I look up to them every week in awe of their resourcefulness, prescience, and just overall raw software engineering knowledge.\n\nOur journey with eth2 started with a few of us posting in a go-ethereum gitter channel regarding starting a prototype implementation of Vitalik’s sharding FAQ. Little did we know that just a few months later, we would be neck deep into everything about proof of stake and sharding with Vitalik and the Ethereum Research team in Taipei. Coincidentally, I was visiting New York the same week I met Preston online via gitter, and managed to meet up in his office and start Prysmatic Labs officially within the next few days!\n\n### Robert Drost \n\n- Quilt  \n- Project Manager\n- August 2018 \n\nLooking back, one remarkable thing that stands out to me is the unifying culture of optimism and positivity among the people who found Eth and Eth2 and dove into working on it. Kind of by self-selection over time, it's a community that wants to strive for the positive side of things. While it’s not always possible to maintain this, somehow over time it seems to always get back there again.\n\nMoving forward, two themes I look forward to will be the acceleration of innovation and delivery around Eth2, and the growth of bridging among Eth2 and most other crypto communities and protocols that matter.\n\nShoutout to Casey Detrio — I love how he always seems to find a novel analysis angle to things!\n\n### Sam Wilson \n\n- Quilt  \n- Protocol Research Engineer\n- October 2019 \n\nWell, I'm a relative newcomer to Ethereum. I'd been vaguely aware of Ethereum for years, and I had (and still have) a couple hundredths of a bitcoin lying around, but Devcon V was jumping head first into the space.\n\nThe Ethereum community, once you get past all the... crap on the fringe, is full of really welcoming people who come from really diverse philosophies. I found that particularly surprising, given how many scammers and hangers on there are.\n\nEth2, which is actually where I started learning Ethereum, is a huge undertaking being built by an equally huge amorphous conglomeration. Seeing the discussions from execution environments and WASM to pure data availability and minimal execution, and the journey from where we were a year ago to actually getting the beacon chain launched has been one of the most exciting periods of my career so far.\n\nI'm looking forward to the next phases, layers, and whatever else comes with Eth2, but more importantly, I'm excited for the memes, because really, that's what this is all about.\n\nIt's hard to compare what I've contributed with the amazing other things going on in the space, but I guess I'd have to say that the write-up on dynamic state access that Ansgar Dietrichs and I put together is probably the most influential thing I've worked on: [\"State Provider Models in Ethereum 2.0.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/state-provider-models-in-ethereum-2-0/6750)\n\n### Shay Zluf\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Client Implementer\n- March 2019 \n\nLooking back on this past two years makes me feel how this space is being shaped by the people who build it, their values and their convictions. Working in Prysmatic Labs developed my skills and code quality in a way that I cannot describe. Raul Jordan and Preston van Loon make sure to lead by example. All the team members are super motivated and take eth2.0's success as their own responsibility. That kind of dedication comes only from taking part in a project that has higher purpose for each member of the team. Looking forward, I see those bright and enthusiastic figures attracting many more talented people into the eth2.0 effort, while step by step the Ethereum ecosystem becomes the collaboration infrastructure of humanity.\n\nI took part in kickstarting the slasher implementation in Prysm's code base. As context, old POS systems had a major flaw, called the \"nothing at stake problem.\" Policing the set of rules to avoid this on the massive scale of the beacon chain is a challenge. Solving this led to the design and implementation of the Prysmatic Labs slasher. Working with other team members and protolambda from the eth2.0 research team was a great privilege. I got a first hand experience of protolambda’s ingenuity in finding novel solutions to hard problems.\n\nShoutout goes to Preston Van Loon.\n\n### Stefan Talpalaru\n\n- Status  \n- Client Implementer\n- November 2018 \n\nWe're moving at what probably looks like a slow pace, from the outside, but I'm confident we'll be able to replace Proof of Work with Proof of Stake. I can't wait to see the estimates for energy consumption reduction in the years to come!\n\nI'm proud of the many changes that lead to reproducible builds. It all started with replacing a language-specific package manager with Makefiles and Git submodules, in order to have a fine-grained control over all our dependencies. Over time, it grew into a somewhat reusable [\"build system.\"](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-build-system)\n\nI also liked designing and implementing well-defined components like our [metrics library](https://github.com/status-im/nim-metrics/) or the [NAT traversal library](https://github.com/status-im/nim-nat-traversal). Much messier, but equally rewarding, was changing the Nim compiler and standard library to implement [efficient stack traces](https://github.com/status-im/nim-libbacktrace).\n\nI like hunting down mysterious stack corruptions. A memorable one was due to the wrong calling convention being used in a [C library wrapper](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/pull/677#issuecomment-575636421). Another [nice one](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/issues/640#issuecomment-57008484) was triggered by a procedure parameter called \"errno\" (which the Nim compiler forgot to name-mangle).\n\n### Terence Tsao\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nIt has been an amazing journey, we have learned and accomplished so much along the way. Lots of great memories and friendships were formed. \n\nWith Phase 0 heading towards finish line, I'm particular excited about Phase 1 and all its cutting edge research. Go Eth2!\n\n### Victor Farazdagi\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Engineer\n- February 2020 \n\nMy Ethereum journey started in 2016, when I joined Status in building a censorship-resistant messenger. It quickly became apparent that, despite all the goodness the Ethereum platform and its decentralized network brought, in its current implementation they are relatively limited. So, getting attracted to Ethereum 2, with all its ambitious plans to revamp an already hugely innovative product, was just a matter of time for me. Right now, being part of the amazing crowd of highly motivated, even idealistic, people - with a chance to participate in delivering on the original Ethereum promises - is nothing less than a dream come true. I love the community, the leadership, and even the complexity of the software we're building. With Phase 0 behind us, we have significant momentum, so 2021 will definitely become a year of groundbreaking accomplishments!\n\nOne bit of work I am particularly proud of is the [\"initial synchronization implementation,\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/tree/develop/beacon-chain/sync/initial-sync) which absolutely every beacon-node runner relies on. So, whenever you cannot sync, or sync takes forever, you know who to blame for it now!\n\nRegarding nasty bugs, during the [\"Medalla incident\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/7039) in August 2020, we had troubles syncing back. While the fix was easy, discovering the problem wasn't.\n\nShoutout to Diederik Loerakker! (yeah, better known as protolambda)\n\n### Vitalik Buterin\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- January 2014 \n\nI'm really happy to see how far the Ethereum ecosystem has come in the last few years! In the dark old days back in 2014-2017, it was just myself, Vlad and a couple other people thinking about proof of stake and sharding, and progress was slow; since then, there has been a rapid growth, professionalization and general improvement in the ecosystem and the team. We have much more sophisticated tools, are dealing with advanced cryptography, and a much better process for creating and refining the spec and the implementations. 2020 eth2 is sooo much better than Casper in 2017!\n\nNow, of course, we enter what may perhaps prove to be the most difficult part of the whole process: getting eth2 actually out the door and running. The whole process reminds me of what we had to deal with back in 2015, except this time there's 10x the complexity, 100x more people watching and 1000x the value at stake. Good luck all :)\n\nIf I had to pick one component I'm proud of .. maybe [the entire phase 0 spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md)?\n\nShoutout to Danny.\n\n### Will Villanueva\n\n- Quilt  \n- Researcher\n- February 2018 \n\nEth2 research was overwhelmingly fun. We explored pushing the boundaries on how the execution layer could operate. We prototyped, researched, and implemented a simpler version of advanced execution (Execution Environments) on eth1, also known as account abstraction.\n\nA lot of the work Quilt pursued is covered in the post titled [\"Ethereum 2.0 Phase 2 Progress.\"](https://medium.com/@william.j.villanueva/ethereum-2-0-phase-2-progress-7673b57eabff) \n\nAdditionally, some of our account abstraction work can be found on Ethresear.ch as [\"DoS Vectors in Account Abstraction (AA) or Validation Generalization, a Case Study in Geth.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/dos-vectors-in-account-abstraction-aa-or-validation-generalization-a-case-study-in-geth/7937)\n\nShoutout to Danny Ryan, all the way!\n\n[Onward [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=32)\n\n---\n\n*Kudos for reading to the end!

While the content and framing has evolved over the past 6 months, the core vision has remained the same: to craft a crypto-native artifact that captures the humanity of the people building the future of Ethereum.\n\nIt contains the hopes, fears, and anticipations of the Eth2 researchers and client implementers directly responsible for bringing the Beacon Chain to life on December 1, 2020. The future of the Beacon Chain is the future of Ethereum, and we’re proud to tell part of its story this far.\n\nWe prompted contributors with a few questions - you'll find them in order in each response, some but not all answered.\n\n- Name / handle\n- Affiliated orgs\n- Primary role\n- Eth2 rough start date\n- General summary of experiences\n- Code or documentation they are particularly proud of\n- Most memorable or painful-to-discover Eth2 bug\n- Person you've come to admire or want to give a shoutout to\n\nKeep in mind that these responses were gathered both before and after the Beacon Chain launch, so references to launch expectations will vary. Profiles are ordered alphabetically by first name.\n\nFinally, while we made the utmost effort to include as many people as possible, it’s inevitable that we missed or were unable to feature some contributors. Eth2 wouldn’t be what it is without the input of hundreds of community testers and code contributors - thank you.\n\n---\n\n### Ethereum = Eth1 + Eth2\n\n- Ben Edgington\n- Originally [published on eth2.news](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/wnie2_210328), 28th March, 2021\n\nLet's start with a quick history of what's become known as Eth2, and where it's headed in the future.\n\nRecently, Danny Ryan has announced his [intent to deprecate](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/11/finalized-no-23/) the use of the terms eth1 and eth2. As the creator and curator of “What’s New in Eth2,” this is a bit of a blow!\n\nBut, on the whole, I agree that these terms are beginning to outlive their usefulness, and are in danger of becoming quite misleading. It’s not really about fiddling with names; it’s about capturing fundamental changes in direction, and communicating them clearly. Changes in the roadmap are confusing for the community. Clarity in naming aids clarity of understanding.\n\nHere's a brief history of naming things in Ethereum’s roadmap.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the first use of the name “Ethereum 2” was by Vitalik in Hacker News, way back in [April 2014](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7554923). He positioned Ethereum 2 as being a future step-change in the capability of Ethereum through the use of “fundamental cryptographic upgrades.”\n\nEthereum 2 then drops out of view, and the main narrative becomes the familiar Frontier → Homestead → Metropolis → Serenity progression, first described in [March 2015](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/). In this scheme, Serenity is the network upgrade to Proof of Stake; Serenity isn’t Ethereum 2 per se. Interestingly, sharding/scaling doesn’t have a clear place in that roadmap, although it was certainly discussed [around that time](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/04/05/blockchain-scalability-chain-fibers-redux/).\n\nProgress largely followed this plan for some years, with Homestead going live in March 2016, and Metropolis (in name at least) in a pair of upgrades in October 2017 and February 2019.\n\nSerenity was to have been delivered via a process of upgrading the existing Ethereum chain to bootstrap Proof of Stake. That upgrade was specified in [EIP-1011](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1011.md) and there was even a [testnet](https://hackmd.io/@aTTDQ4GiRVyyce6trnsfpg/Hk6UiFU7z?type=view) that went live on December 31st, 2017.\n\nHowever, the road to Serenity was found to be a dead-end, not least because of the vast amount of Ether that stakers would require - 1500 was the number back then.\n\nSo, in mid 2018, we tore up that roadmap and started afresh with Ethereum 2.0. Rather, we reverted to Vitalik’s original idea from 2014 of an Ethereum 2 that was to be a significant cryptographic step-change to the protocol. Calling this Eth 2.0 made sense: we were planning to change pretty much everything about the platform. Ethereum 1 would eventually be brought in as a kind of legacy system. This Ethereum 2.0 roadmap came with neat consecutive phases: Phase 0 for Proof of Stake; Phase 1 for data shards; Phase 2 for executable shards; and, finally, bring Eth1 over to Eth2 after all that.\n\nWe’ve now delivered Phase 0, but the rest of the plan has evolved. As per the latest Eth2 pages [on the ethereum.org website](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/), “Eth2 [now] refers to a *set of interconnected upgrades* that will make Ethereum more scalable, more secure, and more sustainable” (emphasis mine). This looks much more like the old Serenity plan! We’re upgrading the Ethereum chain in-place rather than doing the old rip-and-replace.\n\nSo, you see, the roadmap narrative has vacillated over the years between effectively doing a replacement of Ethereum 1, referred to at various times as Eth2, and doing in-place upgrades to Eth1. Today, we’re more or less back in upgrade territory.\n\nIn view of all this, applying the Ethereum 2.0 moniker to the entire project is now seen as confusing: to some it implies a different chain to today’s Ethereum; to others, even [a different coin](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/md75k2/will_be_eth_20_a_new_coin_or_will_be_the_same_eth/). It suggests incompatibilities and problems ahead.\n\nThe [latest naming trend](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/11/finalized-no-23/), then, is to limit Eth2 to refer only to the consensus layer upgrade of Ethereum to Proof of Stake, and to refer to all of today’s Ethereum (fka Eth1) as the execution layer.\n\nIt's good to see everything moving under a consistent terminology and a shared roadmap. I'm looking forward to a productive rest of 2021 and beyond!\n\n[Continuations [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=26)\n\n### Aditya Asgaonkar\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- 2019 \n\nEth2 promises to deliver a decentralized, scalable, and secure blockchain platform on which stateful applications can live. These three qualities will be the driving force towards the mass adoption of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn the quest to satisfy the design requirements, we've also seen some amazing research and engineering progress. We have pushed the frontier of computer science in areas such as Byzantine consensus, signature aggregation, and VDFs. With the launch of Phase 0, we created the largest BFT consensus network in existence, which is an awesome feat in itself!\n\nMy favorite bit of work was the [\"Weak Subjectivity Guide\"](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/weak-subjectivity.md) - a document that outlines the weak subjectivity safety features of the Eth2.0 network. The goal is to prevent long range attacks that appear specifically in PoS consensus.\n\nAs for favorite bug, there was a consensus (fork-choice) issue discovered right before the Beacon Chain launch. The first priority was to assess the threat level of the attack -- it was critical and could have lead to a large-scale failure, but was extremely difficult to execute. Fixing this attack vector required a comprehensive review of the fork-choice component, and we had already identified a couple of solutions. At the end, there was agreement among the spec team that the attack didn't pose a critical threat because of its difficult execution, and we decided to publish a fix after further review was completed.\n\n### Adrian Manning\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Co-Lead Developer\n- Aug 2018 \n\nThe project has always been ambitious. The early designs were well thought out, but had shortcomings which became apparent when realising them through implementation. The collaboration between researchers and developers constantly iterated on these design specs for years, finally achieving a workable version of the original concept. The process was longer than expected, but it's been amazing to see the coordination and what has been achieved by a globally distributed group of implementers and researchers.\n\nOf all the work put into the Lighthouse client, I've changed and modified various architectures and designs and I'll likely continue to do so. I'm therefore not particularly fond of any individual piece relative to another. But I'm very proud of the end result. The resulting Lighthouse code-base that came together from everyone's hard work is what I'm most proud of.\n\nAs for person to give a shoutout to, I'm sure everyone has a similar answer, but for me it's Danny and Proto. Danny for the amazing organisational role and interfacing with all the client teams (especially on contentious topics) has sped up the development immensely. Proto (Diederick) for his relentless troubleshooting, bug-finding and research endeavours. He has been invaluable in interop testing, optimisation improvements and all round improving the general state of all clients and the eth2 ecosystem in general.\n\nAlso - there's an Australian saying, which I think applies to all eth2 researchers and developers: We're not here to f$!k spiders!\n\n### Adrian Sutton\n\n- Teku  \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2018 \n\nEth2 is this big idea that started as a seed right back when Ethereum began and then went on this crazy, messy, long journey as the details were thrashed out through open research and public collaboration. All that messiness and the length of the journey is a result of this unique, highly collaborative and distributed approach to designing it. Multiple times, concepts that had been thought settled were thrown out because a better idea came along. While that has been frustrating for on-lookers, it has led to and continues to lead to huge improvements in the resulting technology.\n\nThe interop lock-in in Canada was a major turning point in the progress of Phase 0. It forced the Beacon Chain out of that research mode. Suddenly, client development was less about translating the Python spec to another language and more about engineering all the other components that make a client actually usable. Client teams finally had a stable platform to work from and make clients interoperable. There was an explosion of tools to aid developers in debugging and testing across clients. The Beacon Chain had stopped being a research project and started being an engineering one. The road to Mainnet started to become clear.\n\nNow with the deposit contract launched and deposits flowing into it, the pressure to deliver the rest of Eth2 really amps up. Community pressure to unlock those funds again will become overwhelming and despite all the warnings that it won't be quick, people will be disappointed at how long it takes. But those locked funds will also be the equivalent of the interop lock-in, forcing work out of the research phase and into production. All that time spent researching led people to wonder if Eth2 will ever ship, but with the beacon chain launch and all that money locked in, Eth2 has almost unstoppable momentum.\n\nThe future of Ethereum is very bright.\n\nI'm quite proud of my blog post explaining the weak subjectivity period: [\"Exploring Ethereum 2: Weak Subjectivity Period.\"](https://www.symphonious.net/2019/11/27/exploring-ethereum-2-weak-subjectivity-period/) It was just me trying to get my head around a concept everyone seemed to be very hand-wavy about and put off solving to the future, yet it's become one of the standard reference points to explain the concept.\n\nI'm proud to have worked with Meredith Baxter and Cem Ozer. They have both been doing all the heavy lifting for Teku, almost entirely behind the scenes. They aren't flashy Twitter personalities, they just put their heads down and do the work.\n\nA few anecdotes to conclude: \n\n1. Family commitments mean I don't travel much, so when the first 7-client interop happened and a photo was posted of people crowded around the computer watching it, everyone in the photo was quickly identified but no one had any clue who I was. For a little while I was just \"that random guy in all the eth2 photos\".\n2. Before Ethereum, Ben Edgington only ever wore button-up, collared shirts. He's now exclusively dressed in Ethereum related T-shirts and has even picked up a penchant for Ethereum hoodies.\n\n[Caravans [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=27)\n\n### Afri Schoedon\n\n- Byzantine Fault / ESP Grantee  \n- Testnet Engineer\n- June 2018 \n\nI was working at Parity Technologies in 2018 which managed to implement EIP 1011, the \"Hybrid Casper FFG\" in the Parity Ethereum client. It was a hybrid proof-of-stake approach to the consensus engine and literally my first memory of seeing anything Eth2 related actually being implemented and run. There was Casper testnet up and running with Harmony, Pythereum, and Parity. It was exciting to see the idea of \"Serenity\" starting to materialize. \n\nHowever, it was the same year (only a few weeks later) that the Berlin Eth2 workshop decided to completely discard the hybrid Casper ideas in favor of the beacon chain. Admittedly, it was a massive undertaking. After all the ideation and the first implementations and testnets, we basically started from scratch. \n\nPrysmatic Labs first caught my attention when they launched their first public beacon chain testnets at the end of 2019. I was wondering why we had seven Eth2 clients but none of them was able to synchronize to the other clients' testnets. I was hooked and reached out to the Ethereum Foundation and the Goerli Initiative about contributing to multi-client testnets. And that's what I did in 2020, testnet after testnet up to the mainnet launch.\n\nWhen we launched the Goerli testnet in January 2019, it was not only an important milestone for Eth1 but it was also the perfect chance for Eth2 client teams to use this for their Eth1 integration leading up to the beacon chain genesis. Prysmatic Labs seized this moment and deployed all their Eth2 testnets to date to the Goerli testnet. Coindesk wrote a feature story with the headline [\"A New Test Network Just Activated and Ethereum 2.0 Will Be Using It.\"](https://www.coindesk.com/testnet-gorli-ethereum-serenity)\n\nAll my work on Eth2 concluded with the Eth2 mainnet launch in December 2020. The eight multi-client testnets are well documented on Github and received quite some [media attention](https://github.com/goerli/medalla).\n\nAs for bugs or missing features, that would be the lack of [BLS signature verifications](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/2081) in the deposit contract.\n\nShoutout to Hsiao-Wei Wang!\n\n### Alex Stokes\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- 2018 \n\nWhat a ride it has been! The launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020 represents the culmination of years of research and development across countless contributors from every corner of the globe, reaching as far back as the Ethereum genesis block.\n\nIt has been exhilarating to watch this effort go from a collection of wild ideas (e.g. informal talks on Casper from Devcon 3) to today’s production-scale mainnet. Having been involved before the “casper + sharding” merge and the formation of the eth2 umbrella, I have seen time and again how a dedicated group of individuals adapts and responds to changes both inside and outside the community. It is this resilience that I find most exciting, and that gives me confidence in a very bright future for Ethereum.\n\nWe are ready to weather whatever challenges may come our way and I cannot wait as we deploy a scalable Ethereum in 2021 and beyond.\n\nI'll highlight [some of the early Casper work](https://github.com/ethereum/casper/pull/143) that got me involved directly with eth2 in mid-2018. Part of the original proof-of-stake design involved a validator registry contract hosted on the eth1 chain. As part of the deposit process, validators provided an arbitrary smart contract for signature verification. While an interesting application of account abstraction, this smart contract needed to be deterministic so that signatures could be independently verified on-chain. In order to ensure the smart contract had the desired properties, it was processed by another smart contract, the \"purity checker\" (in the sense of a pure computation), during the initial registration.\n\nAn early version of the purity checker was written in a now deprecated smart contract language called Serpent LLL. I created a Gitcoin bounty to port the Serpent LLL to a language stack used in the ethereum/casper project, Vyper LLL.\n\nMost painful bug would definitely have to be debugging cross-client interactions during the eth2 interop event in 2019. Fun times, good people and challenging bugs!\n\nShoutout to protolambda!\n\n### Alex Vlasov\n\n- TX/RX  \n- Applied Researcher\n- July 2019 \n\nMy predominant impression is that Eth2 poses problems, which are perhaps the most challenging from a software engineering point of view, at the moment. This is exciting from a researcher's perspective, but sometimes frustrating from a software engineer's one. We must adapt, in order to survive in the endeavor.\n\nOne aspect is that we, as software engineers, are used to optimizing for the common case, largely overlooking rare ones. But the latter ones are exactly what an attacker will thoroughly scrutinize! The habit is difficult to break, especially considering that it demands huge amounts of time to analyze and optimize the worst case behavior.\n\nI'm confident that we have to use Formal Methods, as testing is not able to explore the search space exhaustively (except for rare cases, when the space is relatively small).\n\nAnother important aspect is that modern DeFi is demanding on resources. And that is not only data throughput, but EVM/CPU throughput too. ZKP/zkRollups is an obvious example. However, asset pricing can be computation hungry too. And, as we can see now, DeFi asset pricing is an important topic. Unfortunately, EWASM turned to be a much harder idea to implement than initially expected. And it's basically for the same reason - WASM JIT compilers are optimized for a common case, while worst case scenarios can be exploited by an attacker. So, I treat it as another manifestation of the problem discussed above.\n\nWhile the problems are difficult, I am very excited to investigate and implement potential solutions.\n\nOne idea that I'm working on is a (semi-)automated transpilation of Eth2 beacon chain Python specs to Kotlin. The [resulting Kotlin code](https://github.com/ericsson49/research/blob/master/beacon_kotlin_generated/src/phase1/spec.kt) is beautiful, IMHO. Kotlin turned to be a pretty good match for (a statically-typed subset of) Python.\t\n\nAs for a specific bug, it's not yet made public (as it can turn to be a serious vulnerability). But the basic idea is that swapping two lines leaves a function 100% functionally correct, while an attacker can send the code into a practically endless loop.\n\nShoutout to Danny Ryan!\n\n[Discovery [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=28)\n\n### Ben Edgington\n\n- Teku  \n- Chronicler of Eth2 and Teku PM\n- January 2018 \n\nI could write a book on this, and perhaps one day I will. But the tl;dr is that getting to where we are has been the most incredible journey of my career.\n\nThe technology is thrilling, and the distributed development model no less so. But the highlight above all is getting to work every day with such a brilliant, thoughtful, capable, and generous group of people. If it's true that technology reflects the people who build it, then Eth2 is going to be a superb foundation for all the systems of the world.\n\nAs for the future, the beacon chain was designed, developed and delivered astonishingly quickly, having been conceived only in June 2018. Things get harder from now on: the beacon chain already carries so much value, and we need to begin taking into account the existing value on the Eth1 chain as we work on a merge. I think our main challenges ahead may not be technical, but more governance related. But I am confident that, with the ethos we've established and momentum we have as a community, we can bring this thing to a successful conclusion.\t\n\nI've enjoyed writing up regular digests of the latest developments in the spec since October 2018 at [eth2.news](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/), really with an audience of just the other Eth2 devs in mind. Over time it's grown and evolved, and now gets between three thousand and ten thousand views per edition. This amazes me.\n\nI am still happy with my one and only ethresear.ch post, co-written with Nicolas Liochon: [\"Exploring the Proposer Collator split.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/exploring-the-proposer-collator-split/1632) While more of a design bug than a code bug, some credited it with finally finishing off the old sharding design, and precipitating the move to the beacon chain. I think things may have already been heading in that direction at the time.\n\nAs for individual shoutouts, what an incredible group of people - you are all amazing!\n\n### Carl Beekhuizen\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- April 2018 \n\nAlthough eth2 has taken longer to get off the ground than I think any of us imagined, the result is extremely robust, secure, and decentralised.\n\nIt is incredibly exciting to see how eth2 is evolving and maturing into the backbone of the decentralised future we all dream about.\n\nI'm most proud of the key-derivation EIPs (2333, 2334, 2335). Specifically, the quantum-secure backup keys built into EIP 2333. In the event of a quantum apocalypse, validators should be able to recover using these Lamport signatures.\n\nI'm also really proud of the Launchpad. 🦏 So many validators managed to deposit safely.\n\nSpecial shoutout to Hsiao-Wei Wang for the attention to detail and diligence she brings to everything she works on.\n\n### Cayman Nava\n\n- Chainsafe Systems  \n- Client Implementer\n- December 2018 \n\nThe past two years have been a blast. Looking back on the progress we've collectively made and the state of the ecosystem, I feel like we're on the cusp of something great. And I'm honored to be a part of it. I anticipate that Ethereum will be of critical importance for the future, as a rock-solid foundation that empowers ultimately successful experiments which aim to resolve many of the hardest problems facing society today.\n\nI'm proud of the [typescript implementation](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ssz) of SSZ (a copy of Proto's remerkleable). It fulfills the spec, but in an ergonomic way. You can operate on an ssz merkle tree as if it is a 'normal' javascript object. This required some exotic code, but the result is seamless [ssz <-> javascript interoperability](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/lodestar-medalla-update-59865a5cce1a).\n\nHuge thanks to Proto and his work! Many of the tools / algorithms / methods he's published are present in Lodestar: remerkleable, eth2-fastspec, protoarray fork choice, etc. the list goes on.\n\n### Celeste Seberras\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Technical Content Strategist\n- May 2018 \n\nIt has been a humbling experience to have witnessed the growth of Prysmatic from a small seedling with a dream to the robust and diverse community it harbours today; equally so for the broader Eth2 ecosystem. Hard work over the past two years has proven that, through all the speculative noise and interindustry drama, the things that truly speak are code and passion.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the Prysm client usage manual.\n\nShout out to all the boys here at Prysmatic Labs. You are all fantastic to work with, here's to the future!\n\nShoot for the stars. Even if you miss, holy fuck you're in space!\n\n### Cem Ozer\n\n- Teku  \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2019 \n\nI’m blown away that the Eth2.0 beacon chain is now alive and well. For me it was such a complex undertaking, and deep down I was scared it would never launch or be successful.\t\n\nWhen I first joined Teku (called Artemis back then) we were almost only working on the state transition. The spec changed pretty rapidly at the time, and as a result we had to update our state transition many times. I found myself leading these changes at Artemis, and it would almost always be a week long intense marathon where we’d change thousands of lines of code as a team, and I’d try to make sure we did not break anything.\n\nLuckily this was in the prototyping phase, this is not how it’s done today in the production phase :). I’m also pretty proud of having worked on the Eth1 Deposit Management of Teku.\n\nMy best bug discovery is luckily documented by my team lead Adrian Sutton on his blog: [\"The Curious Case of the Invisible Fork.\"](https://www.symphonious.net/2020/07/06/exploring-ethereum-2-the-curious-case-of-the-invisible-fork/)\n\nShoutout to Johnny Rhea, Adrian Sutton, and Protolambda. These three people are all geniuses in their own unique ways. It was an honor and an incredible experience working with them.\n\n[Build - Maintain [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=29)\n\n### Chih Cheng Liang\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Client Implementer\n- November 2017 \n\nI'm glad to be part of Eth2 development. There are too many people; I can't express my gratitude enough. There are lots of beautiful memories that I'll cherish forever.\n\nI'm excited to see what Ethereum will be with fully-fledged PoS as well as sharding.\n\nI'm most proud of introducing the Milagro BLS binding to Trinity. BLS signatures are like the steroids of Eth2. Back then, only one Python library, py_ecc, met the requirements of the Beacon Chain spec. py_ecc is great for research or education purposes, but for things like client implementations, the performance of the library is not on par. The naïve alternative is to find a Python binding of a fast language. Chia's Python binding to C++ code was the low hanging fruit to pursue.\n\nAs the Beacon Chain BLS requirements became more specific, and we had to interop with other clients in a short timeframe, we decided to try using Python to wrap \"milagro_bls\" - Sigma Prime's Rust library. The result is the \"milagro_bls_binding\" library. I'm proud of it because that's my first Rust-ish project, and it was used in a real use case.\n\nAs for most challenging bug, in early 2018 I worked on the [Casper prototype testnet](https://github.com/ethereum/trinity/pull/954) that Karl and Vitalik built on pyethapp. Pyethapp had many issues, but the most difficult one to debug was the peer connection issue. I got a lot of help from Dmitry from the Harmony team, he discovered many peer connection issues with the Java client's logs. One of them was pyethapp's catastrophic peer-to-peer bug.\n\nSpecial thanks to Jannik Luhn - he contributed lots of quality work in peer to peer research/simulation and Trinity.\n\n### Dankrad Feist\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- June 2018 \n\nBy historical accident, one of my first ever involvements with Ethereum was the research workshop in Berlin 2018 where the Beacon chain design (and merging of Casper and Sharding) was first decided. I had only come to the workshop because I was in Berlin at the time for my startup and my former colleague and friend, Justin Drake, had invited me to check it out. The concepts that were talked about at this workshop immediately appealed to the nerd inside me -- deep maths and computer science problems, nevertheless approachable and worth exploring to find elegant solutions. \n\nOver the next few months, I tried my luck on some of the problems that were discussed, especially the randomness problem. However, it would only be March 2019 that I left my startup and went to work on Ethereum 2.0 full time, so I would say that the concept of the beacon chain was by then fairly mature and what was left to be done was more tinkering around the edges.\n\nI think it is always worth reminding ourselves that the beacon chain itself, while only one part of Eth2.0, is a very ambitious project. As far as I am aware, Proof of Stake has never been tried on this scale: neither economically nor in the networking sense. What I mean by this is the sheer amount of funds that can be staked on the beacon chain, which due to the Ether market cap can easily approach billions of dollars in value. This is one advantage smaller projects certainly do have over Ethereum -- they can increase stake gradually, whereas Eth2.0 will very quickly go all the way.\n\nNot only that, but most other projects have refrained from actually imposing penalties on validators -- which compromises the security of PoS networks, but obviously makes designing it much easier, because literally nothing is at stake except for some very minor rewards.\n\nFinally, and this is the most important distinction, Eth2.0 is designed so that it can literally accommodate a million validators. That's pretty impressive considering that most other projects only support around 100! Not only that, but this feat is achievable using fairly modest node requirements, in fact it seems perfectly plausible to run a validator on a mobile phone or a Raspberry Pi.\n\nWhen we do launch the beacon chain, which is now truly imminent (barring extreme surprises), we should keep in mind just how ambitious this project is even on its own. \n\nThe beacon chain was essentially frozen 3 months after I joined the team full time, so I would not claim that I have made any major contributions to it. My most important contribution to Eth2.0 that is slated for inclusion so far is re-architecting the Proof of Custody construction so that it is fully suitable for SSVs (Secret Shared Validators). While we weren't too sure of the experimental cryptographic Legendre pseudo-random function (PRF) when we first came across it in March 2019, it has successively improved to a truly impressive construction on all fronts that I am now very proud of:\n\n1. Extended cryptoanalysis has improved our confidence in the Legendre PRF a lot in response to several bounties that we have set out.\n2. The combination of the Legendre PRF with the Universal Hash Function primitive, suggested by Dmitry Khovratovich, means that only a single evaluation of the PRF is needed per proof of custody, and the rest of the computation is extremely efficient and even faster than regular (sha256) hashing.\n3. Thanks to the probabilistic 0.01 bit proof of custody idea, only a small amount of information is leaked from the proof of custody, such that it would be impossible to gain access to custody secrets even if the Legendre PRF were broken outright.\n\nFinally, I have huge respect for Danny Ryan. He is phenomenal at keeping everything together and making it work.\n\n### Danny Ryan\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- 2017 \n\nSurprise! Everything is a bit harder than originally expected (at least from my perspective) - I suppose most of the things worth doing in life are. Today, I am very excited about the project and the progress. Eth2 has an incredibly strong technical background and is ready for the next wave of upgrades. Huge shout-out to the hard work from client teams, as well as to the validator community keeping this thing running.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the [beacon chain spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md).\n\nFinally, I don't want to imagine how this would have gone without protolambda's insight and technical contributions over the past couple of years.\n\n### Dmitriy Ryajov\n\n- Status  \n- libp2p developer\n- August 2019 \n\nSuper grueling, but rewarding in terms of overall impact on the different ecosystems, Eth2 itself, the Nim language and libp2p.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the Nim libp2p implementation.\n\n### Hsiao-Wei Wang\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- Summer 2017 \n\nMy journey started with implementing Serenity™. It was an ambitious and abstract concept. We've struggled with the design trade-offs for a long time, but with more and more contributors who devoted their efforts, and years of hard work, we were finally able to divide and conquer Eth2.\n\nIt was a fantastic journey to launch Phase 0 finally. I'm so grateful for the broad community support. And, of course, the Ethereum heroes who dove into Ethereum R&D.\n\nI'm very excited about the next Eth2 milestones and the creative ideas that the community will build on Eth2.\n\nI want to mention my admiration for Virgil Griffith, a pioneer that paved the way for Ethereum research work.\n\n[Seen and Seeing [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=30)\n\n### Ivan Martinez\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Engineer\n- August 2018 \n\nWorking on Eth2 has been an amazing adventure. It went from contributing in my free time to becoming my longest running full-time job. While there have been a few blocks on the way (unstable spec, implementation problems, testnet drama), it's been an absolute blast and this is just the start! Very excited to release, and move forward with future phases!\n\nI am particularly proud of building our [end-to-end testing suite](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/3932), which has proved incredibly useful for detecting issues before changes reach the canary. I've also helped build a lot of the [slasher](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/5043) and optimized it for mainnet usage.\n\nOne of the most memorable bugs I encountered would have to be: [\"Change StreamIndexedAttestations to use target root for state regen #5971.\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/5971)\n\nShoutout to Terence Tsao! His ability to understand the spec has constantly amazed me (he's the largest contributor to the spec outside of the EF!).\n\nAlso.. Danny Ryan is awesome :)\n\n### Jacek Sieka\n\n- Status  \n- Research Lead\n- March 2018 \n\nI was fortunate to join Eth2 at the very start - having worked on many open source projects before, for fun, peer-to-peer networks like DC++, compilers like nlvm, as well as high-frequency trading. It all came together at that point like a perfect fit - a giant stroke of good luck. Here we are, years later, with the baby well on its way to being delivered.\n\nThe work I'm most proud of is managing to restore sanity and switching [Eth2 to Little Endian](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/139). It survived several high-profile attempts to swing it back to Big. I guess a more memorable, and certainly more involved feature, was the deep collaboration on the networking protocol that culminated with [what we have today](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/1328) - this was quite the achievement made possible by some round-the-world collaboration with Adrian (of Sigma Prime), Raúl (of libp2p) and lots of others! Less known is that me and Adrian resorted to flipping an Ethereum block hash coin to see who would get to post the PR :)\n\nI'm most proud of when Paul Hauner and I managed to run a fully independent, self-sufficient [multi-client Eth2 network](https://twitter.com/jcksie/status/1171886857908609024) for the first time, at the Canada retreat!\n\n### Jonny Rhea\n\n- Teku, TX/RX  \n- Client lead & TX/RX co-founder\n- November 2018 \n\n\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.\"\n\nParticularly proud of my Ethresearch post, [\"Packetology: Validator \nPrivacy.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/packetology-validator-privacy/7547) \n\nMost memorable bug: [\"DoS Attack on Prysm Stops Finality.\"](https://github.com/ethereum/public-attacknets/issues/12)\n\nShoutout to the Russians!

Most proud of my implementation of the deposit tree logic in Teku. Toughest bug was getting the \"is_valid_merkle_branch\" method working in Teku.\n\nShoutout to Jonny Rhea & Mikhail!\n\n### JosephC \n\n- ConsenSys  \n- R&D\n- January 2019 \n\nThe Beacon Chain launch is like Project Mercury: getting into space/orbit. The equivalents of Project Gemini and Project Apollo are needed next. Rollups and Layer 2 will help improve scalability, but I believe there is much innovation that can and should continue to be done in Layer 1. There is a place for some execution, and cross-shard transactions in Layer 1. I also think that we should be careful about assumptions that we might make, like assuming that cross-shard transactions must be asynchronous. The challenges in the Ethresearch thread [“Cross-shard DeFi composability”](https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-shard-defi-composability/6268/9) need tackling with minimal assumptions.\n\nI dream of a system that is more scalable, performant, but preserves the default atomicity and synchronicity of Ethereum. I dream of shards that are transparent and automatically load-balancing. It may sound impossible, but can be used to inspire the engineers of the world to build the ambitious system that we can envision.\n\nDevelopments like Apollo and the Internet are an encouraging reminder to what humanity can accomplish: where there's a will, there's a way.\n\nWhy is this important? Why is a platform for decentralized systems important? John Perry Barlow may have answered it with his [“Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace.”](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence)\n\nPersonally, I'm delighted that [\"The Beacon Chain Ethereum 2.0 explainer you need to read first\"](https://ethos.dev/beacon-chain/) is usually on the first page of Google for \"beacon chain.\" I'm most proud of forming and recruiting a talented R&D group at ConsenSys that has made numerous Ethereum contributions. For Eth2, these include a review of the deposit contract and influencing an important Solidity implementation. More well known is the Quilt team, which started from R&D of Eth2 Phase 2 (execution, threads [quilting], rather than Plasma). Finally, years ago I helped connect Karl Floersch to the Casper \"team\" at EDCON Paris.\n\nShoutout to all of Ethereum Layer 0 -- its people -- without which there would be no Layer 1 or beyond. Layer 0 always welcomes you, and all contributions great and small :)\n\n### Justin Drake\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- Late 2017 \n\nLooking back, the beacon chain took longer than expected to ship and there is significant work remaining in the coming years. Having said that, I am incredibly optimistic and excited about the future of Ethereum—I could not be more bullish :)\n\nI'm pretty proud of the fact that the beacon chain spec is executable - it's pretty remarkable IMO. How many complex internet protocols have a full executable spec, not to mention four production-grade implementations on day 1?\t\n\nOne of the \"design bugs\" I was involved with early on was having PoS and sharding be separate cryptoeconomic systems as opposed to one unified design. Another big design flaw was using plain (as opposed to aggregatable) signatures. Looking back, in ~2 years we took a visionary but very rough design and made it orders of magnitude better.\n\nFolks dedicated to Eth2 are a rare breed (less than 100 of us) and I have tremendous respect for the team as a whole, as well as many individuals. I will note that, with where things are headed, we may soon have trillions of dollars running on Eth2 and we will need more manpower. So I want to give a shoutout to you—the reader—to consider joining the Ethereum mission :) Hit me up by email, on Twitter, or on Telegram!\n\n[Traditions [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=31)\n\n### Karl Floersch\n\n- prev. Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- Winter 2017 \n\nIt has been a wild journey to scale Ethereum & we are ridiculously close to realizing the vision after all this time. It's pretty insane. I'm most proud of the early work I did on [Casper](https://github.com/ethereum/casper) and initial implementation of [Hybrid Casper](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/tree/b704a5c6577863edc539a1ec3d2620a443b950fb/ethereum/hybrid_casper). As for bugs, the pyethereum p2p layer was absolutely terrible and really crippled the testnet :'''(\n\nShoutout to Vitalik, Hsiao-Wei Wang, & Justin Drake!\n\n### Kirk Baird\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nIt's been a very busy two years; as only my second job working in IT, the learning curve has been massive. First and most importantly, my understanding of the core technologies around blockchains has matured from seeing them as a secure linked list to the complex beast they are. With the focus of my work being on integrating BLS into Lighthouse, a significant knowledge of pairing based cryptography was needed. The BLS signature scheme is far more complicated than the existing ECDSA used in Eth1. Luckily, there are a lot of good resources out there which explain how to progress from classical elliptic curve cryptography to pairing based cryptography.\n\nI was lucky enough to go to DevCon Osaka in 2019 which was an amazing experience! There were so many keen minds all meeting to relish and enjoy the progress Ethereum has made, but also to provide insights and ideas on how it will be improved and developed over the coming years. Japan itself is also an amazing place with so much to see, until we almost got stuck in a typhoon.\n\nI am most proud of the work done on [Milagro BLS](https://github.com/sigp/milagro_bls). This library was rough around the edges when I first inherited it, being a long way from the standardised signature scheme we have now.\n\nFinally, wanted to give a shoutout to Danny Ryan! The man is a weapon.\n\n### Mamy André-Ratsimbazafy\n\n- Status  \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2018 \n\nI remember reading the \"70% ready\" spec in july 2018, that was the wild wild west. Things were on a HackMD document, changes were made every 6 hours and very hard to track - as mentioned in the EthCC 2 talk [\"Tests and Simulations of Eth2.0.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c4mQg5L6Rs&t=597s)\n\nOne of the most significant milestones was when, out of nowhere, all 7 clients at the time were able to create a testnet back in September 2019 in Muskoka. Anticipation, apprehension, will the launch work? If yes, that is definitely a huge milestone!\n\nI'm proud of my work on the [\"Auditors Handbook to Nimbus Beacon Chain.\"](https://nimbus.guide/auditors-book/01_introduction.html) Nimbus uses a dark horse language called Nim. It happens to be easily picked up, and our 3 audit teams were pleasantly surprised by its features, including those related to correctness.\n\nThe most infamous bugs we had were related to fork choice / Proof-of-Stake. The most infamous one would be this one-liner hotfix, where some votes were skipped in period of non-finality: [\"hotfix fork choice score application #2041.\"](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/pull/2041/files)\n\nBig respect to Protolambda! He came like the Hagibis storm.\n\n### Matt Garnett \n\n- Quilt  \n- Researcher\n- January 2019 \n\nMy perspective on eth2 is probably very different from many people who were focused on Phase 0. Although I compartmentalized Phase 0 and Phase 1 to a large degree to allow myself to consider the possibilities of Phase 2, I never considered the possibility that eth2 wouldn't ship. To me, it was not a matter of \"if\" but \"when.\"\n\nI'm proud of the work I did writing the first Execution Environment for eth2, called [\"sheth.\"](https://github.com/quilt/sheth) It was completely stateless and allowed Ether transfers within a shard. \n\nShoutout to Proto, he has been instrumental in making eth2 happen, I don't know how he manages to be so prolific.\n\nA quick story to wrap up. On the first day of the Canada interop, the Quilt team drove up from Toronto in a 15-person passenger van. It had rained a bit so the area was sort of wet. The venue was tucked away off on a gravel road, right beside the lake. We pulled the van up next to the parked cars and headed in to visit with the eth2 teams. \n\nAfter catching up with everyone, we returned to the van to drive over to the airbnb we were sharing with the ewasm team. Will Villanueva had driven us there, so he hopped in the driver's seat and began orienting the van forwards to head out. The area we had parked in was sort of a T-intersection and there were small drop-offs (0.5m maybe) into a heavily wooded ditch anywhere there wasn't road. Will backed into one of the legs of the T and started to drive forward to leave. Unfortunately, the exit path was a rather steep gravel hill. The 2WD van didn't have the traction climb out and now we were positioned at an awkward angle in the T. The van was perilously close to tipping over into the ditch. Will backed up to a flatter part to regroup. I offered to give it a shot and he obliged. \n\nAt this point, we had drawn a bit of a crowd. I recall having people at each corner of the van, keeping an eye out to help avoid falling off into the ditch. I gave it a few attempts, but realized how difficult of a situation we were in. At this point, it was unclear if we could even return to our starting place, as the front left and back right of the van were less than a foot away from falling into the ditch - a ditch that would no doubt require a tow truck to collect the van from. There was no other option than making it up the hill. Fortunately, there was a bit of flatter ground between the van and the beginning of the hill. Although it would be a tight fit, likely inches on either side into the wooded ditch, I thought that with speed we should be able to build enough momentum to get past the steep portion of the hill. I shared my plan with the spectators. Unsurprisingly, the uninvested patrons were eager to fill me with confidence so they could enjoy the spectacle. I backed up the van as far as the gravel road would allow and then slammed the gas down. The van lurched forward, albeit lethargically, towards the top of the hill. The eth2 gods were almost certainly looking down on us in that moment and guided that van safely to the hill's peak. \n\nAt the top of the hill, I collected my emotions and then stepped out to enjoy the laughing and cheering. We inspected the ridiculous situation we had been in, and examined the ruts that the tires had made spinning out on the fail attempts. After the excitement died down and the spectators returned to the venue to continue working on their clients, we headed back up the hill to our van and drove home. \n\nFor the rest of the time there, we parked the van at the top of the hill and walked down to the venue.\n\n### Mehdi Zerouali\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Security Engineer, Cofounder\n- October 2018 \n\nI find it hard to believe that we're finally launching the beacon chain! So much hard work from so many different entities has gone into this over the past couple of years. I'm extremely proud of what Sigma Prime has accomplished so far and look forward to the Lighthouse crew making Phase 1, Phase 1.5 and Phase 2 a reality.\n\nThe structural differential fuzzer I've helped build as part of Beacon Fuzz is definitely something I'm proud of. Over the last few months, Beacon Fuzz helped uncover more than 40+ bugs on all major client implementations, including critical consensus related vulnerabilities.\n\nIt's hard to pick one person to recognize, but Diederik Loerakker (aka protolambda) has done such an amazing job helping the client teams navigate the optimisations required to implement the eth2 spec in production. Of course, the coordination job done by Danny Ryan is second to none. I doubt we'd be where we are today without these two exceptional individuals.\n\nFun fact: Lighthouse releases are named after Rick & Morty characters!\n\n### Meredith Baxter\n\n- Teku  \n- Client Implementer, Software Engineer\n- November 2019 \n\nI was fortunate to join the Teku team at an exciting time (about a year ahead of the beacon chain launch) in November of 2019. We had a lot of work ahead of us and we weren't sure whether or not we would meet launch deadline with a fully functional, production-ready client. The learning curve to understanding eth2 is also pretty steep, which only increased the pressure. Luckily, the EF and other eth2 client teams have been an incredible resource for us throughout the development process. The engineers involved across the client teams have been very open and supportive. And the EF researchers have been amazingly welcoming, approachable, and responsive. They've always been there for us to answer questions and provide insights. It has been hugely gratifying to be a part of the successful launch of the beacon chain with the help of this incredible group of people. I'm very excited to continue the work as we look forward to upcoming changes including our first hard fork, sharding, and the merge.\t\n\nOne exciting milestone was getting [Teku syncing to a live](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/1143) testnet (Prysm's Sapphire testnet).\n\nI'm also really proud of our [checkpoint sync feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz3flfj50Ig) which allows new nodes to sync up and become fully operational within minutes. See the issue as well: \"[Implement sync from a recent state #3063](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/issues/3063).\"\n\nThe instability on the Medalla testnet in the fall of 2020 was a trying moment across the client teams, but we came out stronger on the other side. We were all working overtime to improve performance and patch issues revealed by the long period of non-finalization. One big fix I managed to push during this time involved putting a hard limit on amount of work required to regenerate states that dropped out of our in-memory cache: [\"[Issue 2608] Add ability to periodically persist hot states #2611.\"](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/2611) More context on the network instability can be found here: [\"Eth2 Implementers’ Call #46 - 2020-08-20.\"](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/S1b2sJhzv)\n\n### Michael Sproul\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Client Implementer\n- March 2019 \n\nAfter a brief foray into the blockchain world in 2017, I developed a taste for it and knew I had to come back. When I saw a job ad from SigP on Twitter for a proof-of-stake client in Rust, I dropped what I was doing and got involved ASAP. At the beginning I got deep into Lighthouse's consensus code which was then very much in flux due to lots of spec changes, and had been written in a gargantuan solo effort by Paul! From that foothold in consensus I then branched out into the database, op pool and slashing -- all of which captured my interest in a way no other project had. \n\nWhen we ran the first testnets in September 2019 off code I'd contributed to, I was kind of shocked the thing worked at all, and awed by all the hard work done by everyone else involved. This community of researchers, programmers and enthusiasts has been nothing but amazing, and I'm optimistic for a successful Phase 0 launch and the realisation of the Eth2 dream in Phase 1 and beyond. Personally, I can't wait until we can run some transactions, and look forward to getting into the minutiae of WebAssembly execution environments.\t\n\nI'm very proud of Lighthouse's slasher. I was able to draw inspiration from great foundational research laid by Proto, and dedicate myself to building a fast, concise implementation. Testing the implementation on Medalla and watching the carnage inflicted on other validators brought a perverse form of satisfaction ;)\n\nOne of my favorite bugs: [\"DB inconsistent after restart #1488.\"](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/1488)\n\nShoutout to Cem Özer!\n\nI know of at least one core dev who force pushed a commit to master in the EthDenver bathrooms...\n\n### Mikhail Kalinin\n\n- PegaSys, TX/RX  \n- Applied Researcher\n- April 2018 \n\nIt's been exciting to see how Hybrid Casper FFG and the Sharding proposal have been merged into what is now called the Beacon Chain. And how this research is evolving, growing, attracting a lot of new people. And finally the result is about to be shipped pretty soon. This was a big part of my life for two and a half years. I anticipate rapid movement towards Shards and the Merge when Phase 0 is shipped. Though there are many things yet to deal with.\n\nI am proud of the [Eth1 Shard Demo](https://github.com/txrx-research/eth1-shard-demo) that we made together with Guillaume from EF with decent support from EF researchers.\n\nI can give recognition to a bunch of people tbh. But, narrowing down, Danny Ryan and Ben Edgington.\n\n### Nathaniel Jensen\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Security Engineer\n- September 2019 \n\nI'd heard a bit about Ethereum before but had not developed a solid understanding.\n\nAlthough relatively new, I'm glad to play a small part in such a technically impressive undertaking. I am continually appreciative that I can work in such an interesting space, with such friendly and impressive colleagues and community, and contribute to something that has the potential to be profoundly important. I'm excited to see Phase 0 mainnet kick off, the culmination of so much effort!\n\nI look forward seeing the space continue to develop with the incorporation of the EVM chain and Layer 2 solutions, and all the interesting use-cases that I can't begin to imagine.\n\nMy primary contribution to the Eth2 ecosystem had been taking on maintenance and development of a differential fuzzer that compares state transitions across the Eth2 clients: beacon-fuzz. In September 2019, Sigma Prime was engaged by the Ethereum Foundation to continue development of Guido Vranken's previous differential fuzzing solution - comparing ZRNT and Pyspec, the Go and Python Eth2.0 executable specifications.\n\nI was primarily responsible for building out [the fuzzing framework](https://github.com/sigp/beacon-fuzz) to include comparison of other client implementations: Lighthouse, Prysm, Nimbus, Teku, Trinity, as well as adding fuzzing targets for additional state transition functions.\n\nAs for most painful bug, see the [\"Beacon Fuzz update 001\"](https://blog.sigmaprime.io/beacon-fuzz-01.html) on the Sigma Prime blog, section \"Golang Library Linking Errors.\" How to try to get multiple Go implementations running without having their dependencies clash, and dealing with arcane linking issues using existing tooling to build a Go fuzzing library that exercises cgo/C code (as Prysm depends on a C/assembly BLS library).\n\nI want to give a shoutout to Protolambda (Diederik Loerakker). He reliably gets to the bottom of really obtuse fuzzing results. He's our consistent fallback for deciphering complicated results across multiple Eth2 client implementations. From our interactions, he clearly comes across as a friendly, genuine, and technically outstanding individual.\n\n### Nishant Das\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Client Implementer\n- June 2018 \n\nIt was a very difficult endeavour to get Eth2 running smoothly. Ultimately, with teams well distributed across the globe, constant communication is always a challenge. However, despite all that, I am really proud of the fact that we have launched Phase 0 with 4 different clients running. I'm very optimistic for the future and am looking forward to the merge. There have been too many bugs to count, and I keep on finding new ones every week.\n\nShoutout to Proto - cross client compatibility would be nowhere near what it is without him constantly monitoring and working on it.\n\n### Paul Hauner\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has fostered an inclusive, open, and merit-based approach to technical collaboration. Under this environment we've seen many researchers, engineers and communicators flourish. This is a testament to what people can do when they share a common goal and are empowered to work on the things that interest them.\n\nAs Eth2 has progressed, Sigma Prime has grown steadily to include a team of talented engineers and computer scientists. I am grateful to work with these people and I learn from them every day.\n\nI hope to see Ethereum evolve into a tool that provides honest utility to everyday people, without jeopardising the sovereignty of their data or selves.\n\nRegarding work I'm proud of, I quite like the [minimal-allocation Merkle-tree hasher](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/stable/consensus/tree_hash/src/merkle_hasher.rs) I built in 2018. It's simpler and more powerful than other algorithms I have seen.\n\nOne notable bug: [\"Manipulating deposit contract to gain an early majority #1446.\"](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1446)\n\n### Pawan Dhananjay\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2019 \n\nI remember reading Vitalik's proof of stake blog posts in early 2018 and thinking that it sounds all good in theory, but no way we'll have a proof of stake protocol for more than a small number of participants which would work well in practice. Needless to say, it's been extremely impressive to see how far the effort has come in just a few years. Kudos to everyone involved, I'm glad to have been a part of the effort for the past year.\n\nAlso, a huge shoutout to the SigP crew! It has been an absolute blast working with these guys, learning from them and also indulging in their jolly Aussie humor :) Excited for the Phase 0 launch and geared up to begin work on Phase 1!\n\nMost memorable bug would have to be: [\"Update state before producing attestation #1596.\"](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/1596)\n\nBig thanks to protolambda for sure. All his debugging tools have saved me (and many others I'm sure) hours of effort.\n\n### Preston Van Loon\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nThe last few years have been an adventure, to say the least. At first, I had just a mild interest in Ethereum. I didn't own any cryptocurrencies or really understand how they worked. After a few months of reading, I started to realize two things: 1) Ethereum was this incredible technology that has an unlimited potential to change the world for the better, and 2) Ethereum is incredibly slow and desperately needed to scale. \n\nImmediately, I looked for ways to help contribute to the scaling effort and then I met Raul Jordan. We met together in NYC for coffee and talked about starting a project to work on sharding for Ethereum. We formed Prysmatic Labs. Since starting the company in January of 2018, I've met some of the most interesting people in the world - many have become close friends. Working in Ethereum continues to fulfill my desire to make a positive impact, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing the completed roll out of Eth2.\n\nMost memorable bug would have to be that time that all of Prysm nodes thought they were 4 hours in the future and thousands of validators were slashed in a testnet: [\"Roughtime reports clock offset by 4hrs #6825.\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/6825)\n\n### Protolambda\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- November 2018 \n\nThe main theme is that we - researchers and client devs - did not make our lives easy. Spec updates have continued to improve the protocol itself, but caused instability in the process of updating implementations. A new network stack was adopted, and many difficult research and implementation problems had to be solved. In the future, I do not think this will change, as Phase 1 and later are complicated too. But the approach can be improved. Exploratory single-client implementation ahead of others could avoid duplicating work for other clients, and enable faster spec updates.\n\nMost memorable bug: [\"247120: encoding/binary: read at most MaxVarintLen64 bytes in ReadUvarint.\"](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/247120)\n\nShoutout to @Butta for his work on the beaconchain explorer.\n\n### Radosław Kapka\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Software Engineer\n- May 2020 \n\nWhat struck me most when I joined the project was the seemingly infinite amount of good will and patience from others when onboarding a new contributor. I really appreciate it. As for the future, I fail to see how Eth2 can not succeed when there are so many great people working on it.\n\nShoutout to the whole Prysmatic team! Everyone is so cool I can't just pick one person.\n\nI planned to visit Japan in the summer of 2020 and start learning Eth2 after coming back. The pandemic ruined my plans so I joined the Prysm project in May as a contributor. Three months later I got invited to be one of the core team members. Pretty cool, huh? I guess 2020 is not that bad after all.\n\n### Raul Jordan\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nWe went from being a bunch of hobbyists and volunteers interested in Ethereum's future, to having a ton of responsibility with a client being used by a large portion of stakers today. Core dev work was indistinguishable from magic to me before starting on this, and it honestly still is. However, I am fortunate to be surrounded by people much smarter than I am, and constantly learning how to write better code. Every day, we feel the weight of the work we do and we foresee it will only keep getting more important, as Phases 1 and 2 develop and eventually Ethereum will be powering world-scale transaction volume, likely using the code we wrote. At some point, the blockchain we are building might have multinational implications, and the hard work from the research team to make it as robust as possible is very encouraging. I could not be any happier with how far it’s come along, and we'll ship it.\n\nI am most proud of our [original eth2 API](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/ethereumapis). One day I was hanging out with Preston and Terence and we’re like “whoa! Etherscan built a block explorer using our API for eth2??” and then beaconcha.in popped up and it was honestly mind-blowing. We spent a lot of time putting it together and it contributed to the success of the Prysm client early on.\n\nOur most memorable bug would have to be the [Medalla Testnet Incident](https://medium.com/prysmatic-labs/eth2-medalla-testnet-incident-f7fbc3cc934a).\n\nI admire my team at Prysmatic Labs. I look up to them every week in awe of their resourcefulness, prescience, and just overall raw software engineering knowledge.\n\nOur journey with eth2 started with a few of us posting in a go-ethereum gitter channel regarding starting a prototype implementation of Vitalik’s sharding FAQ. Little did we know that just a few months later, we would be neck deep into everything about proof of stake and sharding with Vitalik and the Ethereum Research team in Taipei. Coincidentally, I was visiting New York the same week I met Preston online via gitter, and managed to meet up in his office and start Prysmatic Labs officially within the next few days!\n\n### Robert Drost \n\n- Quilt  \n- Project Manager\n- August 2018 \n\nLooking back, one remarkable thing that stands out to me is the unifying culture of optimism and positivity among the people who found Eth and Eth2 and dove into working on it. Kind of by self-selection over time, it's a community that wants to strive for the positive side of things. While it’s not always possible to maintain this, somehow over time it seems to always get back there again.\n\nMoving forward, two themes I look forward to will be the acceleration of innovation and delivery around Eth2, and the growth of bridging among Eth2 and most other crypto communities and protocols that matter.\n\nShoutout to Casey Detrio — I love how he always seems to find a novel analysis angle to things!\n\n### Sam Wilson \n\n- Quilt  \n- Protocol Research Engineer\n- October 2019 \n\nWell, I'm a relative newcomer to Ethereum. I'd been vaguely aware of Ethereum for years, and I had (and still have) a couple hundredths of a bitcoin lying around, but Devcon V was jumping head first into the space.\n\nThe Ethereum community, once you get past all the... crap on the fringe, is full of really welcoming people who come from really diverse philosophies. I found that particularly surprising, given how many scammers and hangers on there are.\n\nEth2, which is actually where I started learning Ethereum, is a huge undertaking being built by an equally huge amorphous conglomeration. Seeing the discussions from execution environments and WASM to pure data availability and minimal execution, and the journey from where we were a year ago to actually getting the beacon chain launched has been one of the most exciting periods of my career so far.\n\nI'm looking forward to the next phases, layers, and whatever else comes with Eth2, but more importantly, I'm excited for the memes, because really, that's what this is all about.\n\nIt's hard to compare what I've contributed with the amazing other things going on in the space, but I guess I'd have to say that the write-up on dynamic state access that Ansgar Dietrichs and I put together is probably the most influential thing I've worked on: [\"State Provider Models in Ethereum 2.0.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/state-provider-models-in-ethereum-2-0/6750)\n\n### Shay Zluf\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Client Implementer\n- March 2019 \n\nLooking back on this past two years makes me feel how this space is being shaped by the people who build it, their values and their convictions. Working in Prysmatic Labs developed my skills and code quality in a way that I cannot describe. Raul Jordan and Preston van Loon make sure to lead by example. All the team members are super motivated and take eth2.0's success as their own responsibility. That kind of dedication comes only from taking part in a project that has higher purpose for each member of the team. Looking forward, I see those bright and enthusiastic figures attracting many more talented people into the eth2.0 effort, while step by step the Ethereum ecosystem becomes the collaboration infrastructure of humanity.\n\nI took part in kickstarting the slasher implementation in Prysm's code base. As context, old POS systems had a major flaw, called the \"nothing at stake problem.\" Policing the set of rules to avoid this on the massive scale of the beacon chain is a challenge. Solving this led to the design and implementation of the Prysmatic Labs slasher. Working with other team members and protolambda from the eth2.0 research team was a great privilege. I got a first hand experience of protolambda’s ingenuity in finding novel solutions to hard problems.\n\nShoutout goes to Preston Van Loon.\n\n### Stefan Talpalaru\n\n- Status  \n- Client Implementer\n- November 2018 \n\nWe're moving at what probably looks like a slow pace, from the outside, but I'm confident we'll be able to replace Proof of Work with Proof of Stake. I can't wait to see the estimates for energy consumption reduction in the years to come!\n\nI'm proud of the many changes that lead to reproducible builds. It all started with replacing a language-specific package manager with Makefiles and Git submodules, in order to have a fine-grained control over all our dependencies. Over time, it grew into a somewhat reusable [\"build system.\"](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-build-system)\n\nI also liked designing and implementing well-defined components like our [metrics library](https://github.com/status-im/nim-metrics/) or the [NAT traversal library](https://github.com/status-im/nim-nat-traversal). Much messier, but equally rewarding, was changing the Nim compiler and standard library to implement [efficient stack traces](https://github.com/status-im/nim-libbacktrace).\n\nI like hunting down mysterious stack corruptions. A memorable one was due to the wrong calling convention being used in a [C library wrapper](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/pull/677#issuecomment-575636421). Another [nice one](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/issues/640#issuecomment-57008484) was triggered by a procedure parameter called \"errno\" (which the Nim compiler forgot to name-mangle).\n\n### Terence Tsao\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nIt has been an amazing journey, we have learned and accomplished so much along the way. Lots of great memories and friendships were formed. \n\nWith Phase 0 heading towards finish line, I'm particular excited about Phase 1 and all its cutting edge research. Go Eth2!\n\n### Victor Farazdagi\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Engineer\n- February 2020 \n\nMy Ethereum journey started in 2016, when I joined Status in building a censorship-resistant messenger. It quickly became apparent that, despite all the goodness the Ethereum platform and its decentralized network brought, in its current implementation they are relatively limited. So, getting attracted to Ethereum 2, with all its ambitious plans to revamp an already hugely innovative product, was just a matter of time for me. Right now, being part of the amazing crowd of highly motivated, even idealistic, people - with a chance to participate in delivering on the original Ethereum promises - is nothing less than a dream come true. I love the community, the leadership, and even the complexity of the software we're building. With Phase 0 behind us, we have significant momentum, so 2021 will definitely become a year of groundbreaking accomplishments!\n\nOne bit of work I am particularly proud of is the [\"initial synchronization implementation,\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/tree/develop/beacon-chain/sync/initial-sync) which absolutely every beacon-node runner relies on. So, whenever you cannot sync, or sync takes forever, you know who to blame for it now!\n\nRegarding nasty bugs, during the [\"Medalla incident\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/7039) in August 2020, we had troubles syncing back. While the fix was easy, discovering the problem wasn't.\n\nShoutout to Diederik Loerakker! (yeah, better known as protolambda)\n\n### Vitalik Buterin\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- January 2014 \n\nI'm really happy to see how far the Ethereum ecosystem has come in the last few years! In the dark old days back in 2014-2017, it was just myself, Vlad and a couple other people thinking about proof of stake and sharding, and progress was slow; since then, there has been a rapid growth, professionalization and general improvement in the ecosystem and the team. We have much more sophisticated tools, are dealing with advanced cryptography, and a much better process for creating and refining the spec and the implementations. 2020 eth2 is sooo much better than Casper in 2017!\n\nNow, of course, we enter what may perhaps prove to be the most difficult part of the whole process: getting eth2 actually out the door and running. The whole process reminds me of what we had to deal with back in 2015, except this time there's 10x the complexity, 100x more people watching and 1000x the value at stake. Good luck all :)\n\nIf I had to pick one component I'm proud of .. maybe [the entire phase 0 spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md)?\n\nShoutout to Danny.\n\n### Will Villanueva\n\n- Quilt  \n- Researcher\n- February 2018 \n\nEth2 research was overwhelmingly fun. We explored pushing the boundaries on how the execution layer could operate. We prototyped, researched, and implemented a simpler version of advanced execution (Execution Environments) on eth1, also known as account abstraction.\n\nA lot of the work Quilt pursued is covered in the post titled [\"Ethereum 2.0 Phase 2 Progress.\"](https://medium.com/@william.j.villanueva/ethereum-2-0-phase-2-progress-7673b57eabff) \n\nAdditionally, some of our account abstraction work can be found on Ethresear.ch as [\"DoS Vectors in Account Abstraction (AA) or Validation Generalization, a Case Study in Geth.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/dos-vectors-in-account-abstraction-aa-or-validation-generalization-a-case-study-in-geth/7937)\n\nShoutout to Danny Ryan, all the way!\n\n[Onward [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=32)\n\n---\n\n*Kudos for reading to the end!
