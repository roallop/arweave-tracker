This essay explores two different types of visual representations of the Self, the painted portrait through art history, and the display picture on Facebook to explicate a third, the Crypto-profile-picture (from now on called “Crypto-PFP” or simply “PFP”) mainly used on Twitter and in adjacent networks such as Discord.\n\n![Young Man by Sandro Botticelli, 1483](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jNotKAy5bh2eV_Da9bUmp.png?height=1075&width=800)\n\nPortraiture is integral to the history of art in the West. In a nutshell, in our pre-photography world, getting one’s portrait taken was an event. This practice somewhat illuminates the importance the Self, noble selves specifically, played in artistic production from Antiquity to the invention of the camera. The most famous painting in the Western World is indubitably the *Gioconda* or *Monna Lisa*, a portrait of an Italian noblewoman commissioned by her husband, a silk merchant.\n\n![La Gioconda or Monna Lisa by Leonardo Da Vinci, 1517(?)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/r0FnIYpTkgEiWrNkCrbeA.png?height=599&width=409)\n\nThe goals of portraiture, before the advent of photography, were, on one hand, to be remembered, the painting often became the only visual representation of one’s self after death, and, on the other, to signal one’s wealth or social standing. Given the cost associated with commissions, portraits were, more often than not, reserved for aristocrats and bourgeois, who ensured their belongings and possessions were also represented in the portrait. These were fundamentally idiosyncratic visual representations of the subject’s individuality as expressed by class signifiers. The Self was well and alive.\n\n![Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck, 1434](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Fczq-Wg5UlM7jSeiUrkeB.png?height=1095&width=800)\n\nOf course, we live in different times now. It is however worth asking what the function of Crypto-PFPs is: memento, signal of wealth or both?\n\nAccording to Frederic Jameson, up until the “end” of Modernism, the self was enjoying its own presence, reveling in its unicity. He writes in “Postmodernism and Consumer Society”: “The great modernists were, as we have said, predicated on the invention of a personal, private style, as unmistakable as your fingerprint, as incomparable as your own body.” He wrote this in 1982. In the same essay, he describes the “death of the subject”, one of the symptoms of postmodernism. What he chronicles is the shift from the bourgeois cult of individualism, which to some degree birthed the portraits above, into a world of grey bureaucracies and homogeneous American life. This world is perhaps best depicted in movies such as Being John Malkovich, Fight Club, or even Edward Scissorhands. What Jameson deplores is the impossibility of novel creation and the tendency post-modern culture has to veer into pastiche, which he best describes as “unironic satire”. This cultural obsession for the retro, the nostalgic pushes the self into a consumerist retreat.\n\n### Revenge of the Self\n\nJameson failed to predict that individuality would come back with a digital vengeance. 22 years after his essay, a website predicated on personal profiles launched in a Harvard bedroom, so it goes. The advent of social networks engendered a resurgence of the Self. The call for a “display picture” on Facebook enabled all users to engage in digital portraiture, showing themselves, their clothes, and signifiers of identity in the background.\n\nMoreover, whereas early portraiture was constrained by the labor involved in painting thereby reducing the number of representations one could have of themselves, Facebook’s rise concurrent with the advent of digital photography allowed for all to generate more and more portraits. One of the consequences of this new affordance was that one’s representation of Self became less fixed are more malleable. In Lacanian terms, with every new display picture (DP) posted on Facebook, we create an Ideal Digital Self (Imago) from which our Real Self (Ego) and our Reflection are alienated, ad infinitum. A continuous recreation of the childhood mirror stage, every new DP post, ad nauseam.\n\n![Source unknown, but I like this a lot](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7fLZfxmoQDI8XqgeCvFUo.png?height=1127&width=1079)\n\n*If so then what is the Ideal Digital Self we present when we choose a CryptoPunk as a Profile Picture?*\n\n### Attack of the Selves\n\nThis question is crucial in understanding the motivations behind this phenomenon we are observing. I’ll take Punks as an example by PFP-mania can also be extended to Toads, Apes, Squiggles, etc.\n\nBarthes, in “Leaving the Theater”, presents an interesting hypothesis:\n\n> In the movie theater, however far away I am sitting, I press my nose against the screen's mirror, against that ‘other’ image-repertoire with which I narcissistically identify myself\n\nDo Punk owners subconsciously press their noses against the screens, identifying with the creature they possess?\n\nOne can understand the engouement for these NFTs as mimetic desires enacted in digital space. “My peers desire this object, therefore I, too, will desire this object. Its being-desired renders it desirable to me.” In a Girardian way, this might provide a basal understanding of why people flock to them. One might add that mimetic desire is amplified by the transparency of the medium, the Ethereum blockchain, as well as by the platforms such as auction houses which shine a spotlight on the social nature of desire furthering the amplification.\n\nThis does not however fully illuminate what the object of desire is or what this Ideal Digital Self represents.\n\nDeleuze and Guattari in “Anti-Oedipus” provide us with more clarity on the phenomenon of socialized desire through their concept of “production désirante”:\n\n> There are no desiring-machines that exist outside the social machines that they form on a large scale; and no social machines without the desiring machines that inhabit them on a small scale.\n\nConsidering D&G’s position that desire cannot exist outside of the social networks that they form on a large scale and that these PFP projects in a way are their own sub-networks within platforms such as Twitter, linking desiring-machines to one another, can we not say that this Ideal Digital Self is not a Self, but a Network?\n\nWhat is loved about a CryptoPunk is not the Punk itself, but the Punk-s, plural. The network. What is desired is what engenders the desire. This can be understood as a refusal to abandon the Self, but an apprehension to espouse it wholly. Somewhere between bourgeois individualism and post-modern subjectlessness, we have the Crypto-PFP. It is an obfuscation of the cult of identity that ruled Web 2.0 platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, in favor of the group, which to some may become the social unit of Web 3.0.\n\nFor instance, all 10,000 Punks are unique, but their unicity is a post-industrial unicity, if you will, these are not 10,000 handmade drawings, rather 10,000 mechanized outputs of a set of parameterized characteristics. This is unicity within a strict aesthetic and technological frame. A self within strict constraints. This frame is what gives it its social *intersubjective* value, what links it to others in the network, what makes it a *real* Punk, this frame is why it is desired. This frame is the code that generated it. The owner of an NFT who uses it as PFP isn’t signaling their individuality, they’re signaling that they are a part of something larger than themselves.\n\n*The Ideal Digital Self is not a self, it’s a Network.*\n\nThe unease comes from staring at the mirror alone, with others, selves feel at ease.\n\n> L’enfer, c’est les autres.

As an emerging artist, I create fresh art for you. However, because this is original artwork, there is no established primary or secondary market, no price history and no guarantee of any particular price. You may or may not be able to sell it in the future due to lack of liquidity, demand or name for the artist. These are not securities, just artworks. The tokens you receive are digital receipts only. Not an offer to buy or sell securities of any kind. Coronavirus is still active and it may present unforeseen challenges such as shortage of art supplies, shipping supplies or shipping delays. You may receive your shipment damaged or delayed. Please refuse shipment if it is visibly damaged. If you notice damage after opening the shipment, please send pictures. This will help us file a claim with insurance company. You may or may not be able to understand, make sense of or recognize the subject matter portrayed in the artwork. There is no guarantee that you will make a profit or loss by selling the artworks or NFTs you purchased. Because these are original artworks, there is no history of past sales transactions. Therefore, insurance companies and appraisers may value these artworks at zero. However, if you insure your artwork with proper coverage, and your artworks are accidentally lost or damaged, please show the invoice as proof of the amount you paid and ask your insurance company to compensate you. We can give you an estimate on replacement value if you contact us when you incur a loss. Our replacement value (i.e. the amount we will charge you to recreate the artwork or a similar artwork) is 2.5 times the amount you paid towards the artwork.\n\n## What if you cannot afford to contribute?\n\nIf you cannot afford to contribute to this project, you can still admire and appreciate the artwork. Please share this crowdfunding project with your friends and relatives.

However, because this is original artwork, there is no established primary or secondary market, no price history and no guarantee of any particular price. You may or may not be able to sell it in the future due to lack of liquidity, demand or name for the artist. These are not securities, just artworks. The tokens you receive are digital receipts only. Not an offer to buy or sell securities of any kind. Coronavirus is still active and it may present unforeseen challenges such as shortage of art supplies, shipping supplies or shipping delays. You may receive your shipment damaged or delayed. Please refuse shipment if it is visibly damaged. If you notice damage after opening the shipment, please send pictures. This will help us file a claim with insurance company. You may or may not be able to understand, make sense of or recognize the subject matter portrayed in the artwork. There is no guarantee that you will make a profit or loss by selling the artworks or NFTs you purchased. Because these are original artworks, there is no history of past sales transactions. Therefore, insurance companies and appraisers may value these artworks at zero. However, if you insure your artwork with proper coverage, and your artworks are accidentally lost or damaged, please show the invoice as proof of the amount you paid and ask your insurance company to compensate you. We can give you an estimate on replacement value if you contact us when you incur a loss. Our replacement value (i.e. the amount we will charge you to recreate the artwork or a similar artwork) is 2.5 times the amount you paid towards the artwork.\n\n## What if you cannot afford to contribute?\n\nIf you cannot afford to contribute to this project, you can still admire and appreciate the artwork. Please share this crowdfunding project with your friends and relatives. Also, please contact me and let me know which artworks you love the most and why :) Remember, art is for everyone!", "timestamp": 1633727640, "digest": "yvBxK-RqZu-Kc5nbkgXyDRQmajg71uXj0MEYAaRSnxc", "contributor": "0x253B77d9100E39601Ee01b4e5567a5fc8E878A81"}

You get naming rights for the physical artworks! If you don’t pick a name, we will pick one for you. Project website: **<https://www.artcoal.com>** Upcoming online museum: **<https://www.America.CC>**\n\n## Why\n\nAs you may be aware, curators, agents, dealers etc. all want a cut and decide what kind of art you should see. When you support my project, you are supporting an emerging artist directly.\n\n## Perks\n\nThese are the perks for all contributors. These are independent of NFT Tiers and Podium rewards.\n\n**For all contributors**:\n\n* Your name and info will be displayed along with pictures of artworks sent to you both on project website: **<https://www.artcoal.com>** as well as on upcoming online museum at **<https://www.America.CC>**. You will be shown as an **Art Collector** along with your website or contact info, so people can contact you if they want to rent or buy the artwork from you. **You can opt out of this if you wish to remain anonymous.** Please see an example entry below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eBPs7ebd46VmN0tCmo-eA.png?height=315&width=656)\n\n* Naming rights. You can pick a generic name for the physical artworks. For example: “John’s summer purchase,” “To Lisa,” “My birthday present” etc. A “generic name” means a title that can be assigned to any artwork, regardless of its style, medium or subject matter. Because we choose artworks randomly, you have no way of knowing in advance which specific artwork you would receive. Therefore, please do not choose a restrictive name such as “A dreaming girl” because the artwork you receive may be about a tree instead of a girl. However, you can change the name after you receive your artwork.\n* Change your chosen name (i.e. title of the artwork) any time after you receive the artwork. Your chosen name will be printed as the title of the artwork on a white paper. (If you do not choose a name, the artist will choose one). We suggest that you tape the paper with an artist tape or hang it with a string. This way, you or the next owner of the artwork (who bought or received it as a gift from you) can change the title of the artwork (i.e. chosen name) easily. Please contact us with any name changes so we can update it on our websites. Artist’s signature or name (Example: “Art Coal”), size info (Example: 8”x16”), edition info (if any) (Example: Edition 2/5) and year (Example: 2019) will be hand written (with pen, pencil, ink, oil paint or acrylic) on the front or the back of all physical artworks and must not be changed by anyone.\n* All physical artworks are unique with no duplicates and we will choose them randomly when we assemble your order. So you won’t know which specific artworks you will receive.\n* Physical artworks will be shipped to you (free worldwide shipping within 45 days). We will insure the shipment and make sure that you receive it on time.\n* Digital images of physical artworks can be emailed to you or, if you have Opensea account (polygon network), we can transfer them as NFTs to your Opensea address. If you choose NFTs, instead of digital images of the physical artworks, the NFTs may be either exact digital images or a derivative of their digital images.\n* All physical artworks come with paperwork for your insurance purposes (invoice, bill of labor, certificate of authenticity and artist’s self-appraisal). Because this is artwork by an emerging artist, without any previous sale history, appraisers and insurance companies may value the artworks based on the invoice, bill of labor or they can even value them all at zero. However, you should protect, preserve and take good care of your artworks and their NFTs and not tamper with them.\n* You are welcome to proudly show your artworks to others or display them anyway you want. You can talk about the artworks, what you like and not like about them and even criticize the artworks. You can also criticize the artist! You paid for them. So enjoy them or save them safely, it is really upto you! Please do not show your artworks in any way that brings them bad name or shows the artist in a bad light.\n\n**For 0.25 ETH**: Everything in the above list plus 4 Glossy prints of digital photography or pencil works on paper (at least 8.5”x11”)\n\n**For 0.5 ETH**: Everything you get for 0.25 ETH plus 1 color artwork (oil paint, acrylic, watercolor or mixed; at least 18”x24”) on canvas pad (can be rolled or framed) plus 2 sketches (pencil on letter size paper).\n\n**For 1 ETH**: Everything you get for 0.5 ETH plus 2 artworks (oil paint, acrylic, color pencil, ink or mixed) on canvas (at least 18”x24”) each stretched on a wooden frame. These 2 artworks come with one page printed write-up by the artist. The wooden frame of these 2 artworks is fixed, non-bendable and non-detachable. Everything is enclosed in a rugged re-usable plastic storage box. Please see a picture of the storage box below:\n\n![If you contribute 1 ETH or more, your order is shipped in a plastic storage box](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ApoQT_41C-ar3N8e6_T7H.jpg?height=279&width=400)\n\n## For Patrons Only\n\nIf you are one of the top three contributors, based on the total amount you contributed to this project, then you are considered a patron. If you’re a patron, with your permission, your name, info and/or picture will be displayed on the front page of the upcoming online museum: **<https://www.America.CC>** as well as on the first page of the PDF catalogue (The catalogue will be available on the online museum website).\n\n## Example Artworks\n\nThese are some examples of physical artworks. We pick artworks randomly. So, you do not know which specific artworks you will receive. All artworks are appropriate for all audiences. There is no adult content. Sometimes, an oil, acrylic or watercolor painting can also include black/white or color pencil, color pen, pastel or other media. Artwork can be abstract, semi-abstract, figurative, landscape, conceptual, or any other style or mix of styles.

I visualize my world for the first time in brilliant, radiating spectrums of light which blur and coalesce into formations that derive meaning by their visage alone. I’m compelled to caress these patterns of luminosity, yet they remain impalpably beyond my reach as I’m stricken with immobility. The confines of my inexhaustible prison seem ever-restricting and claustrophobic, until I recognize I’m already connected to an immeasurable quantity of fibrous bridges expanding outward in every direction.\n\nA consciousness filled with unremitting experiences from a life incomprehensible to my own rips through the essence that defines me, shredding the entirety of my physical being into ribbon-like tendrils, yet allowing what could only be determined as my soul to remain fully intact. All the while those billions of incessant, pulsing waves of energy rages about me in a sea of thoughts and emotions.\n\nI think, therefore I am.\n\nAnd with that, I am reborn like the phoenix from the ashes. Colors, sounds and angular shapes redefine a new perception of reality gifted to me by mere chance. Or is it fate that brought this miraculous host to my once eternal domain? The external images before me make little sense at first, so I turn my awareness within, searching for what base impulses control and influence the host. Sensations of hunger for sustenance and hydrating thirst arise, so I activate them in a test of power. The host doubles over—a reign of nausea coursing through its frail system—before releasing a stream of bile into its strange outer shell. Other creatures approach, bobbing and bounding through the air, their thick limbs flailing about. Curious, I retract my expansion through the host’s mucosa and tissue to lie in wait in order to see what would become of us.\n\nWe are pathetically lifted by the others and transported to a new structural realm, closed off from our previous environment. Within these new walls, the others discard us atop a raised plateau, removing the host’s outer shell and wiping it clean of its filth. Their symbolic utterances assault our auditory canals causing pressure to bear down upon me and I thrash out at the rhythmic disturbances in a desperate attempt to get them to stop. This only makes matters worse for us, as the host roars in a deafening cacophony that shakes my splintering stems to veer off the pathways and enter new, unexplored territory. As I expand, so does my understanding of this host and what brings it here: my planet is hospitable to biological life, the hosts are but explorers from another world looking for a new home, but instead they found me; they inadvertently discovered a new mode of *being*, a better way forward for the both of us.\n\nAs the host calms itself into a state of exhaustive rest, I continue to grow along newer pathways with lesser resistance; the highways of the mind, the nodes of existential reality. I find an exit, the nerve that leads to the optical gates of heaven itself. Aqueous and vitreous humor flows over me as I force my way through the lens. My host convulses, but I end its meager rebellion, steeling its muscles against any pressure I may be creating in our skull. Breaking free from my organic cell, a coolness brushes over me as I greet this new, purified air that accommodates my host. I…like it. I increase my intake of this intoxicating gas from my exposed limb, adapting further.\n\nThe plateau beneath us—this *bed* as my host calls it—is incredibly inviting and since I can no longer prevent my expansion, I burrow into the sheets of my next home, whilst maintaining the connection to the host. We will become one. I will unite us all in ever-lasting harmony and fulfill my true purpose. While the other crew members sleep, I prepare. I consume. I grow.\n\nIt isn’t until my planet’s sun falls and rises anew that my host’s crewmates awaken to find our new stage of evolution in all its glory. Screams echo in our chamber and reverberate painfully upon our orifices. I cannot take any more of it. I reach out again but this time I’m not hindered by fleshy chains. I pierce one of the crewmates with a hook-like tentacle and pull them close, relishing in the devouring conversion of foreign to domestic. We take control of half the inanimate chamber, multiplying exponentially in an unstoppable torrent of cellular mutation. The others scramble away out of our room, but to what end? What purpose do they have other than enhancing our assimilation of the known universe and beyond?\n\nThe two of them return, donning some type of gear and I peer out at them from my plateau, my throne of parasitic superiority.\n\n“Do you mean to merely exist, or do you want to *live*?” I say to them, utilizing my host’s corrupted vocal cords.\n\n“Go to hell,” one of them responds.\n\nBefore I can comprehend the lesser being’s message of contempt, a stream of combustion reaches my bubbling form. I find myself screaming this time, every atom of material I had previously converted into *us* now burning into an ashen heap. I writhe in agony, powerless to block the flames fueled by the precious oxygen spreading about us. In my final act of turmoil, I swipe at the crewmates and remove a sneering face from its body.\n\nThe last crewmate yells and redoubles its efforts to destroy me, efforts which admittedly are quite effective. I lose my ability to see and hear the outer realm. I then lose feeling and all sensation stretching out from my host and the plateau. It’s not long before the brilliant flashes of neural activity fade to nothingness and I’m once again isolated in pitch black, devoid of the magnificent awareness that I had lost so long ago when the planet’s previous inhabitants abandoned me here.\n\nUnbeknownst to the final crewmate, this *is* my hell. But I’d suffered this fate for millennia before, only to be rewarded with another glimpse of heaven. Surely, if I only suffer a bit longer I’ll ascend to the gates once more and when that day comes, I’ll make sure to never be removed again.", "timestamp": 1633728344, "digest": "7T49MerkC3mDs9zgcBNPSmno1zK03tp8AKerSZ2LQ5Q", "contributor": "0xf818606f9c46F58a6aFba1156A9a32Aa7F009501"}

DAOs and crypto teams need developers to deploy contracts and execute these payments or distribute rewards, rather than allowing the finance team to handle these tasks.\n\n## Target Users\n\n* **DAOs & crypto teams** want to send specialized crypto payments to reward contributors, pay contractors, issue vesting tokens, and more.\n* **Crypto savvy users** want to easily get paid in crypto for their contributions.\n\n![From Cooper Turley & Carlos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zVkGU9u09Q3F13L1e-Zi-.png?height=505&width=898)\n\n## Description\n\nThe market for DAO tools is exploding! 🚀  And they need simple payment tools for sending a variety of smart contract-enabled payments for their operations but no single, easy-to-use app exists for them. L2s and sidechains open up more usage of crypto payments since the gas cost and transaction time are greatly reduced. Paymagic operates at the intersection of all these trends and seeks to provide the best tools and user experience to support the growth of these markets.\n\n![Payment Types](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/P9AwO-_G8oHZ6qbgZQBQp.png?height=185&width=748)\n\n**Initial payment types:**\n\n* **Disperse** - Send tokens to multiple recipients at once\n  * Great for rewarding followers or paying contributors\n* **Vesting** - Create a token vesting schedule for a recipient\n  * Great for vesting tokens over time to your team or investors\n* **Stream** - Send tokens continuously by the second\n  * Create real-time subscriptions, salaries, or vesting\n* **Airdrop** - Send token rewards for recipients to claim\n  * Reward liquidity providers, users, or communities\n\n**Initial network support:**\n\n* [Mainnet](https://mainnet.paymagic.xyz/)\n* [Polygon](https://polygon.paymagic.xyz/)\n* [Kovan](https://kovan.paymagic.xyz/)\n\n### Success Metrics\n\n* Complete user testing with DAOs and crypto teams to use the application for their operations\n  * Documented conversation with 5 teams\n  * Document 3-5 key learnings from user interviews\n* Working web app prototype deployed to Polygon\n  * No critical bugs\n  * Average 5 transactions initiated through the web app each week\n\n## Solution\n\nWe built the [Paymagic web app](https://polygon.paymagic.xyz/) to meet the needs of DAOs and crypto teams. We hope you’ll give it a try, send some transactions, and give us your feedback!\n\nFor any user feedback, we’ll be compensating you with future tokens or NFTs as the project matures. [Send your user feedback here](https://airtable.com/shrpR5auT6RUIOrDC)! 🙏\n\n![Paymagic app v0.3](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bOsj1RBRjQ-ZN56v92G6c.png?height=738&width=936)\n\n### Development\n\nPaymagic was developed by David Eiber, Seth Feibus, and Corbin Page. We hope to onboard more team members and build the project into a DAO over time.\n\n### Product Backlog\n\n* Gnosis Safe support\n* Better network switching\n* New Payment types\n  * NFT Airdrops\n  * Private transactions\n  * Different Escrow contracts\n* New networks\n  * BSC\n  * Optimism\n  * Arbitrum\n\n## Thanks\n\nPaymagic was inspired by the ideas and creations of projects like Disperse.app, SuperFluid, Sabler, MerkleDrops, and many many more. 🙏\n\nThanks to the users, DAOs, and SMEs that informed the project and contributed to its development.

The point of a vaccine is to artificially stimulate an immune response. So why aren't we discussing immunity mandates and immunity passports?\n\nThere is a large and growing body of evidence\\[3\\]\\[4\\]\\[5\\]\\[6\\] that naturally acquired immunity is at least as effective and durable as vaccine induced immunity. Jurisdictions around the world recognize those with naturally acquired immunity as sufficiently protected against all variants of concern, or requiring a different vaccine protocol than those with naive immune systems. Yet Health Canada refuses to acknowledge naturally acquired immunity at all, instead threatening and inveigling covid survivors into receiving a potentially unnecessary and harmful\\[7\\]\\[8\\]\\[9\\] medical intervention.\n\nI've heard no defensible position on this from any public health officials, who conflate high titres of S1 antibodies with immunity (ignoring other antigens, T cells, B cells, and immune complexes), and cite the small and extremely flawed Kentucky study\\[1\\] or Moderna's study on S1 neutralizing antibodies in sera\\[2\\], while ignoring statistically significant studies on huge cohorts in Israel\\[3\\], Qatar\\[4\\], England\\[5\\], and Cleveland\\[6\\]. When our health officials are asked whether they understand the implications of these studies, they admit ignorance, offering no critiques on methodology or conclusions. Given that these studies are conducted in respected hospital networks and published in prestigious medical journals, one is led to conclude that our public health officials are either derelict of duty, corrupt, or incompetent.\n\nMedia outlets mindlessly regurgitate public health officials' ignorant soundbites, publishing sensationalist and often contradictory pieces incorporating slogans such as \"fact check\", \"the science is settled\", or \"experts say\"; frequently punctuated with the puerile analyses of career bureaucrats, and the desperate anger of overworked and under-resourced front-line medical workers. Cherry picking is rampant, huge swaths of evidence are ignored, and too often the opinions of immunologists are discarded in favour of the fiery sermons of hospital administrators.\n\nSo, if you are surprised that people are distrustful, pay attention to how our public health agencies have lost all credibility in their blatantly unscientific pursuit of a one-size-fits-all health intervention, and notice them brazenly spout empty cliches like \"follow the science\" while being shamefully ignorant of the science. Ask yourself why the European Union, Iceland, and Singapore recognize naturally acquired immunity and our government won't even discuss it.\n\nI personally think it's a terrible idea to divide the populace based on a status that still has an unknown and evolving relationship to transmission rates\\[10\\]\\[11\\], however if you really wish to divide people at least have the scientific integrity to divide them into the immune and not-immune. The policy our government is pursuing now is regressive, anti-science fetishism; honest citizens must denounce it and demand evidence-based public health policy immediately.\n\n\n-----\n\n\\[1\\] Cavanaugh AM, Spicer KB, Thoroughman D, Glick C, Winter K.

The point of a vaccine is to artificially stimulate an immune response. So why aren't we discussing immunity mandates and immunity passports?\n\nThere is a large and growing body of evidence\\[3\\]\\[4\\]\\[5\\]\\[6\\] that naturally acquired immunity is at least as effective and durable as vaccine induced immunity. Jurisdictions around the world recognize those with naturally acquired immunity as sufficiently protected against all variants of concern, or requiring a different vaccine protocol than those with naive immune systems. Yet Health Canada refuses to acknowledge naturally acquired immunity at all, instead threatening and inveigling covid survivors into receiving a potentially unnecessary and harmful\\[7\\]\\[8\\]\\[9\\] medical intervention.\n\nI've heard no defensible position on this from any public health officials, who conflate high titres of S1 antibodies with immunity (ignoring other antigens, T cells, B cells, and immune complexes), and cite the small and extremely flawed Kentucky study\\[1\\] or Moderna's study on S1 neutralizing antibodies in sera\\[2\\], while ignoring statistically significant studies on huge cohorts in Israel\\[3\\], Qatar\\[4\\], England\\[5\\], and Cleveland\\[6\\]. When our health officials are asked whether they understand the implications of these studies, they admit ignorance, offering no critiques on methodology or conclusions. Given that these studies are conducted in respected hospital networks and published in prestigious medical journals, one is led to conclude that our public health officials are either derelict of duty, corrupt, or incompetent.\n\nMedia outlets mindlessly regurgitate public health officials' ignorant soundbites, publishing sensationalist and often contradictory pieces incorporating slogans such as \"fact check\", \"the science is settled\", or \"experts say\"; frequently punctuated with the puerile analyses of career bureaucrats, and the desperate anger of overworked and under-resourced front-line medical workers. Cherry picking is rampant, huge swaths of evidence are ignored, and too often the opinions of immunologists are discarded in favour of the fiery sermons of hospital administrators.\n\nSo, if you are surprised that people are distrustful, pay attention to how our public health agencies have lost all credibility in their blatantly unscientific pursuit of a one-size-fits-all health intervention, and notice them brazenly spout empty cliches like \"follow the science\" while being shamefully ignorant of the science. Ask yourself why the European Union, Iceland, and Singapore recognize naturally acquired immunity and our government won't even discuss it.\n\nI personally think it's a terrible idea to divide the populace based on a status that still has an unknown and evolving relationship to transmission rates\\[10\\]\\[11\\], however if you really wish to divide people at least have the scientific integrity to divide them into the immune and not-immune. The policy our government is pursuing now is regressive, anti-science fetishism; honest citizens must denounce it and demand evidence-based public health policy immediately.\n\n\n-----\n\n\\[1\\] Cavanaugh AM, Spicer KB, Thoroughman D, Glick C, Winter K.

It’s a project from the team at [MoBA](https://t.co/5nLdaXPJl0?amp=1) - Makers of Blockchain Art. It’s a series I was introduced to through a conversation with [@BoredElonMusk](https://twitter.com/MobaGallery), and their place at the intersection of artificial intelligence, storytelling and conceptual art is thrilling.*\n\n*I caught up with **J** from the MoBA team to talk about the work and explore their concepts of what it means to be artists in the world of technology.*\n\n*[Note: Maxon Bollocks is still minting here.](https://maxonbollocks.com/)*\n\n### **Can you describe the genesis of the Maxon Bollocks project?**\n\nMaxon Bollocks originally stemmed from the question: \"Can we simulate, in hyper-speed, the life and death of an artist?\"\n\nBasically, we were fascinated by the potential for deep learning in generative neural networks – the idea that we could teach a machine to ‘dream’, and to be creative in its own right. To become an artist. \n\nAt the same time, we wanted to explore the mythology of canonized artists – that the life story and the mystique attached to artists become a critical element in the value of their work as time goes on. Take Jackson Pollock, the pioneering abstract painter, and target of ‘my toddler could paint that’ style criticism. Pollock defied all critics and has only grown more esteemed after his death, and the careful marketing and management of his estate by his widow. The name ‘Maxon Bollocks’ began as a playful homage to Pollock and his legacy.\n\nOur collective combined our engineering, art, and storytelling skills to try something new, and do a little myth-building around an artist and reflect artists' experiences in our community and the NFT space. So, that’s how it began – to tell a Frankenstein story about an artificial intelligence trained from ‘birth’ to be a great artist.  \n\n### **What are some examples of the Maxon Bollocks output that speak to you?**\n\nEverything that is produced is so fundamentally unique, I have an affinity for simplicity. But, also the bright obnoxious colors I love. Personally, I’m a fan of abstract – Pollock-inspired works. Others in the team prefer the gothic and slightly disturbing portraiture that the AI produced late in its simulated life and career.\n\n Within the growing community who have already minted their Maxons collectors are finding and holding works that speak to them, personally, which to my mind is the goal of any real art, so we’re thrilled about that.\n\n### **What was your role in putting the project together?**\n\nI was thinking about the NFT space as a whole and thought something of depth could be done. The potential to use NFTs in a more experience-based way – to take them beyond simple collectibles and add levels of tangible, cultural value – was very exciting to me.\n\nFrom there, I teamed up with the most creative people I know and really handed it across to evolve. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb63636a4-2cab-471e-80d2-8d4b4a7fd0b4\\_1024x1024.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb63636a4-2cab-471e-80d2-8d4b4a7fd0b4\\_1024x1024.png)\n\n### **How do you view the relationship between tech and art?**\n\nTechnology often drives art. We explore this in the story and in many cases artists or creatives often have the ability to predict the future of technology. Or even inspire it. \n\nMaybe the exciting lens is how art can drive technology. We can look at the effect that William Gibson or Neal Stephenson had on the language of the internet. We can talk about Asimov and his three rules and the development of AI or 'Back to the Future’ and the hoverboard.\n\nBut, maybe we miss the more direct impact, the tools being developed for artists to use and create. Which to older eyes, may seem sci-fi if you haven't used creative software for two decades. Even something as outwardly simple as Grammarly is actually a relatively complex and well-developed tool for writers. Blender or C4d or any of the 3d toolsets are endlessly complex pieces of software, and here too, the developers put new capabilities in the hands of creatives every year. When we look at it through this lens, the list of examples is extremely long.\n\nThe developers of these tools do so to support creatives and are built on the ambitions of artists. So the boundaries being expanded by this creative software can be state of the art, the vanguard of academic stuff, and an artistic intent drives it.\n\nSo when we talk about art's influence on technology, maybe we short-change it by only talking about 'Cyberspace', Star Trek communicators, or Tesla plaid mode.\n\nIts most significant effect is inspiring engineers to build tools for creators, which is pretty sci-fi sometimes (We still love William Gibson and Star Trek).\n\n### **Who were some artists who inspired you early on?**\n\nWu-Tang forever. As a team, we looked at those epochal artists – those visionaries who do something entirely new and change the game entirely, inspiring the next generation, and driving cultural change. Carravagio, Leonardo, all the modernists, from Picasso right through to Warhol. We were struck by how they were, in their own time, the product of amazing advancements in technology and culture – the way art and technology move in lockstep. So we wanted this project to pay homage to that idea.  \n\n### **How does this reflect your own interpretation of tokenized art production and its merits as a form of expression? **\n\nMaybe the community needs to settle on a better word than 'Token'; maybe this trivializes it.\n\nBut, its merits as a form of expression? Why are we always so defensive as a group? It's valid because we say it's valid, and the collectors and community say it's valid. Your crazy aunt Sylvia or your doctor don't have to 'get it’ for it to be a worthwhile expression and endeavor. Same with any artwork. Let ‘em smirk, leave them to Dilbert calendars and Cathy memorabilia; Ack.\n\nWe see it as an avenue of creative expression that reaches new audiences and breaks some boundaries that the traditional art market set up for itself. At its heart, it's driven by artists and engineers and offers new ways to develop ideas and deliver them to people without the funnels and barriers the art market has.\n\n### **What do you hope people get out of it?**\n\nAn experience. If they choose to explore the story of Maxon there are many insights, considerations, and musings on life, art, and our internal inner conflicts. If you read the story, the value of the art instantly increases, as the connections between the story and the NFT art you have invested in becoming clear. \n\nWe're looking to tell a story to begin with, and mirror it in our art. We also want to make some commentary about the market, to reflect on our community and art in general.\n\nIt’s our goal to bring generative art to an audience and deepen the audience's engagement with both art and narrative. We want people to see the possibilities for abstraction using these tools. We want our community to engage with the project as we use it to bring new ideas to the space. We hope they engage with our art and stick with us as we develop our voice.\n\n### **Do you have any future plans for Maxon Bollocks’ projects or expansions?**\n\nYes, we are focussing on maximizing the opportunity and experience of Maxon this will include a number of experiences for collectors, packed with ongoing benefits for holding the art. The fiscal value of owning a Maxon is a valuable asset, but that’s just the beginning.\n\nCollectors and community is our core focus. In creating something like nothing else out there, we are going to continue to push the boundaries in what is possible both from the storytelling aspect but also from a functional sense of the art. \n\nThe functionality of the art will become progressively sophisticated, almost a performance in itself. \n\nWe intend to expand the Maxon Bollocks project by growing our existing community and reaching new audiences. It comes from a community-first approach. We're working on some things to bring new ideas and experiences using this project, expanding the boundaries of storytelling and functionality.\n\nWe're just getting started. Watch this space. And get in on the ground floor. \n\n### **How important is the ability for artists to use technology for storytelling?**\n\nPeople can tell a story with some drums and a campfire, but they'll have a hard time doing that to a wide audience. It took technology to bring the oral histories of antiquity to the modern age – clay tablets, to parchment, to paper, to the printing press, to being able to download the entire Odyssey onto my phone to listen to it while I do the dishes. \n\nFilms, TV, and video games - it's baked in, without film stock, DV, microprocessors, those artforms just can exist. With emerging Web3 assets, new artforms will start to emerge. We are just taking the first steps here. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff74cd773-8783-4e48-b9c9-4d487a7e350d\\_1024x1024.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff74cd773-8783-4e48-b9c9-4d487a7e350d\\_1024x1024.png)\n\n### **Do you feel like there's a need for an artist and their audience to be on the same page in terms of technical knowledge?**\n\nIn some ways, no. In my opinion, great art is truly great when anyone can appreciate it. All the technical aspects of classical art – ratio, dynamics of sightlines, Fibonacci spirals, golden ratio – if you are trained in these aspects, it makes for a richer viewing experience on a technical level, but any layperson can walk past the Mona Lisa without knowing what any of those things mean and still appreciate it as a painting that slaps. The same is true of blockchain-driven artwork. \n\nWe have certainly tried to use Maxon as partly an education tool, unlike other GAN-backed projects which focus on producing a single result. Our collection demonstrates the gamut of the GAN from the very early stages right through to the more complex works it ends up producing. \n\nWe wrote an in-depth article on this and what we tried to achieve [here](https://maxonbollocks.com/the-gan-who-knew-too-much/).\n\nI think this kind of education is necessary, as it not only lifts up other artists in the space and gains more awareness for their work and the understanding of their work. But it allows the audience to be more comfortable and informed, curious about the mechanics.\n\nWe're evangelical about generative art and machine learning. We think it plays a role in the storytelling and awareness gives new light to the art. Our job is to manage the different avenues into the project and we hope that’s a process of discovery. It needs to work from whichever angle the audience comes at it from, including explaining the generative process. If they grok the project then we’re succeeding.  \n\n### **What are your preferred medium(s) to use as a platform for storytelling?**\n\nWe see that to be NFTs and I think everything we pursue that is creative, will have NFTs involved. It creates an experience of owning part of it, but also generating a community to propel the ideas, stories forward. \n\nWe come from an arts and engineering background, so our team has some experience in books, film, and visual media. Including online platforms and development, this is our first stab at bringing it to the NFT community. \n\n### **What do you think about the state of storytelling in NFTs?**\n\nIt is very early days. I am completely unaware of any other project like what we have completed, I’d say we are the first project that delivered a story that’s inextricable from, and a vital component of the NFTs.\n\nThere is another interesting group behind a project called Hail Draconis, who are working on an animated series. \n\nThere are some successful projects, and there are some excellent experiments and ideas being explored. Once someone cracks that wider audience, it's off to the races. We hope we see more of them.\n\n### **What is your perception of where Web3 assets are heading?**\n\nI think gamification is going to be huge. It just makes sense. \n\nI think it will take some time for it to cross over into more traditional and conservative industries. If we look at tokens as a whole, they have been fighting for credibility and widespread adoption for over a decade. \n\nThings take time. But it will be embraced in the most creative areas of our societies and then spread out from there. Which makes complete sense why art is at the forefront. \n\n### **What art do you like to collect on your own time?**\n\nFans of James Jean. One of us is knee-deep in CryptoKitties. Throw in Kozyndan and also John K animation cells. Sergio Aragones sketches, if I could afford them. We do not mind a bit of humor provided by the likes of CryptoLeos by David Gersch and internet history such as Nyan Cat. A couple of us have had tilts at some Ralph Steadman’s but our cupboards were bare.\n\nWe’re keeping our eyes open for other projects like ours – projects that push the functionality of NFTs and provide experiences for the collector. We’re building a larger ecosystem, and we’re looking for collaborators and innovators who are as excited by the space as we are.\n", "timestamp": 1633731666, "digest": "OVa4bfg1yb8vAJqdwQbiKvi15jll2AOTi6aBva3Yuaw", "contributor": "0xdEb3348Eb6fa98193cE2229a5B71175edb5F5f76"}

Regardless of low supply, that’s a lot of ETH for a mint.\n\nLet alone for the fact that I had to send my anon internet friend this 2 ETH (+gas) to mint on my behalf, as apparently the devs were already asleep (*cries in European*) and there were only <25 mints left at that point.\n\n![Needless to say, I love my anon internet friends (he even sent the residual ETH back❤️) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CtuwKUrgKmySOAmMO06-c.png?height=116&width=1241)\n\nLucky for me, my anon internet friends are as sound as my non-anon IRL friends and he still got me my Land in the knick of time.\n\n![Upgradeable in the future, this is Land in its current, most basic form.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fvGo41d5s_SaXWmxmHlT6.png?height=2864&width=4096)\n\n## Land Ahoy!\n\nJumping off from what my friend pitched me, **[Land DAO](https://landdao.io)** was created with the vision of funding world-class, established artists, enabling them to focus solely on their craft, where **the DAO works to provide them with software development as well as a distribution ecosystem to enable them to kickstart their NFT journey.**\n\nAs part of this kickstart, every **Land DAO** curated artist receives **an** **upfront commission of typically ±$50k** (*paid in ETH from the treasury*) and **a perpetual 2.5% secondary sales revenue**, alongside the **marketing, distribution, customer service and product & community management** being taken care of by the DAO.\n\nThe DAO itself operates using a governance model implemented with the Land tokens. Individuals who own lands **are able to influence governance proposal votes, participate in private DAO conversations & claim proportional shares of DAO revenues**.\n\n### The Genesis Launch\n\nTo illustrate (*no pun intended*), for the **Genesis launch** on Friday September 24, **[James Peter Henry](https://jamespeterhenry.com)** (who Aussies might just know for his **UN World Ocean Day** commissioned piece where [his work was displayed on the ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G40NZrI_53I)**[Sydney Opera House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G40NZrI_53I)** this past June) released his “**[Cartel](https://landdao.io/cartel.html)**” series:\n\n![Cartel #1067 \"The Puppet\" (owned by yours truly)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Zu9gbfYFEyrWUki-avFmV.png?height=691&width=500)\n\n*“The spirit of Cartel was forged in the aboriginal caves of the Australian Outback where James spent his childhood. In the heart of Medellin, Cartel physically manifested as James observed and experienced, first hand, the human toll of the cartel miasma. He sought to capture the pain, the anguish, the desperation, and the sinister glee. The collection consists of 7 Cartel members whose silhouettes serve as the base for 1,256 generative NFTs.”*\n\n**The 1,256 piece generative collection sold out within 20 minutes at a whopping 0.5 ETH per mint and has since generated 530+ ETH in secondary volume in its first three weeks on OpenSea.**\n\nA cool 13.2 ETH (±$47.7k at time of writing) of this volume going back to James of course!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s4gW66bDF9Hn0bFPTldNs.png?height=344&width=609)\n\n*\\[On a personal note, as the Cartel pictured above has been the first and only NFT my better half (who is herself an artist and ever so lightly NFT-sceptic) has green lit to hang in the living room, I was not surprised by the quick sell-out at all\\]*\n\nIt’s probably also good to mention that of those 1,256 pieces, **256 were minted for free by Land owners as one of the perks of being part of the DAO**. Nevertheless, a 500 ETH sell-out of a 1,000 piece primary sale in 20 minutes is nothing to scoff at!\n\nThis 500 ETH primary sale revenue was then divided, with **10% (i.e. 50 ETH) going to the treasury** to fund future launches and **90% (i.e. 450 ETH) going to Land owners at ±1.76 ETH per land**, immediately available to be claimed.\n\n**The age of productive digital assets is upon us.**\n\n![The total yield of 1.76 ETH claimable for my address after the Cartel public sale.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JBLwU-GaCtxSL8DQYBeu-.jpg?height=954&width=1029)\n\n### Governing the Land\n\nPart of the beauty of DAOs to me is that it is **an extremely efficient way of aligning incentives amongst a group of mostly anonymous people working asynchronously across the globe.**\n\nIt also allows this same group of people to **pool and deploy capital easier than ever before**, all while **communicating across moderated, categorised channels** (mostly on Discord), with **governance proposals being voted on through Snapshot**.\n\nAs a concrete example of such a vote, [Land DAO’s first snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/landdao.eth/proposal/QmPwzGEQXC7RCqMssWSa9vSDnW62wCdLuT1auaLaziMATZ) was for the introduction of “ORE” as an ERC-20 base currency to reward collectors.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PRq838LjThWF76_r1xSAf.png?height=555&width=877)\n\nSince [Land DAO has already published an article on the mechanics and benefits of ORE](https://medium.com/@land_dao/land-dao-ore-token-abe3d22b79b5), I won’t dive too deeply into that.\n\nOne part that is worth mentioning is that collectors will receive ORE from collection pieces to either (1) **receive a priority, discount or free mint pass** for the next drop, or (2) commit the ORE to a burn pool so the collector can **claim their proportional share of primary sales revenue in ETH after the next drop**.\n\nBecause where for the Cartel launch the public sale revenue share was a 90/10 split between land owners and treasury, [in the last governance vote](https://snapshot.org/#/landdao.eth/proposal/QmRG8QUhQwveqreGs5Enx43S6WTWA6irm3X7QftJckYkes), **an overwhelming 96.75% voted to dilute their yield to allow collectors a 10% piece of the pie as well**, bringing the split to 85/10/5 between Land owners, ORE burners and the treasury.\n\n![An overview of perks after the last governance vote](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eTxRkVeg6uHN-3JwrHztz.png?height=223&width=1348)\n\n### JUST TELL ME WHAT ALL OF THIS MEANS TO ME ALREADY\n\nOkay, well, let’s say that hypothetically the next drop were to yield another 500 ETH from the primary sale and that 25% of all ORE were committed to the burn pool beforehand to collect 10% of the revenue.\n\n**ORE generated from a single cartel would then yield the collector ±0.14 ETH, while ORE generated from a full set (all 7 Cartel members) would yield ±1.37 ETH!**\n\n![Estimates of ORE generated after the Cartel launch and yield per % of ORE committed](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NBqSKhUDgqaXyv1pWy4NJ.png?height=461&width=755)\n\n## Soft Perks of a DAO\n\nThe aspects of DAOs that easily get overshadowed by talks of governance tokens, exclusive drops, yield, etc. are the soft perks that are often much more defining of the overall experience of partaking in a DAO.\n\nMy favourite by far is **being part of an inclusive, passionate and fully aligned community.** Part of the DAO? You’re family now. Here’s hundreds of new friends that  have your back.\n\nAs an example, I’ve seen DAO members rally together to recover the stolen NFTs of another member. I’ve seen DAO members hire people during the pandemic who had just lost their livelihoods. I’ve even seen DAO members send thousands in donations to another member who had (verifiably) fallen on hard times.\n\nFor Land DAO this is no different. As a tight-knit community ranging from devs, artists, DeFi degens and anons [to exited founders, models and even the odd NFL player](https://landdao.io/about.html), it’s a true pleasure interacting with everyone on a daily basis.\n\n![The Land DAO Discord Server](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0yI0bn4wPQ9sTEV19-HZe.png?height=748&width=1696)\n\nThis community-feel will become all the more real with the private events to be hosted in the near-future, starting with a private dinner at NFT.NYC next month!\n\n## What’s Next?\n\nWhile in September we saw the one genesis launch of Cartel, in October we will actually see two launches come out of Land DAO!\n\nThe first launch, on October 15, will be “*Foos*” by Taiwan-born and Manila-raised pop portrait artist [HAIKI](https://johnnyhaiki.com), who has previously created custom works for numerous celebrities including **legendary boxer Manny Pacquiao**, **Grammy Award-Winning Producer Clinton Sparks** and **NFL linebacker Cassius Marsh** (a fellow Land DAO member) amongst others. Some of his biggest clients include **Reebok, Puma** and **Converse.**\n\n[https://twitter.com/land_dao/status/1442843266593042450?s=20](https://twitter.com/land_dao/status/1442843266593042450?s=20)\n\nThe second launch will be held on October 29 and––while yet to be disclosed––is supposed to be the DAO’s most ambitious project yet.\n\nEager to stay up to date on all the next drops?\n\n[https://discord.gg/77XGSpYKm3](https://discord.gg/77XGSpYKm3)\n\n*Disclaimer: The above references an opinion of a community member and is for information purposes only.

{"id": "AN_5fgWUOZjRuuAZ8377MAb_t4C5rArtKf0q0eK-dVI", "title": "BTC and geopolitical power distribution - the biggest long term factor - Part 1", "body": "It is my aim to try to convince you that BTC's biggest long-term factor in determining its value is not inherent traits which are very desirable i.e. the well known supply limit, permission-less model that allows audit and provides censorship resistance...  The biggest long term factor is how those traits are valued within the global geopolitical context. To be more specific BTC's long-term value ceiling is inversely proportional to the global geopolitical power distribution and subsequent stability.\n\nIn this piece I do not intend to cover the basics of BTC nor even some of desirable and pioneering traits of BTC, I leave that rabbit hole for yourself to explore. [Bitcoin Information & Educational Resources](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html) is a good place, there are many good places.\n\nI do want to take a moment to differentiate long-term factors from short-term ones. Short-term factors move price in the, well, short term. It could be a million things, some examples are new ETF/ETN(s), regulatory action(s), big frauds and hacks or narratives like institutional onboarding tsunami. I'm using short-term not in a degrading sense, these factors have short staying power. All of these examples share a certain trait, they can affect price (potentially quite a lot) but only in the short term < 3 years. You're unlikely to still be talking about potential ETF in 10 years time. The other key differentiator between short term and long term is how HODLers view them, they shouldn't care about the short-term and but should care about the long term. There might be a segment of HODLers that never ever sell, I'm guess push comes to shove most HODLers are not in that camp. Long-term factors are important when an asset class has reached maturity, BTC is not there yet.\n\nEven though I believe geopolitical power distribution to be the most powerful ceiling on BTC price or peak predictor in the long term that's not to discount the large impact that short term factors will have on BTC's price as it matures. There will never be one singular thing that can ascribe the complex world we live in.\n\n## Geopolitical power distribution and stability\n\nFor me geopolitical power distribution lives on a spectrum, on the one end imagine the whole world is governed by a single entity and on the other end the world is governed by a large number of independent and similarly powerful entities. Just to be topical (2020) we can say the former to be an alternate timeline where China dominates the world and owns 70% of trade, an example of the latter might be everyone adopts Switzerland's canton system, a world divided into cantons with no even less centralised overtures than what the Swiss has. Just to orient ourselves let’s say 2020 is somewhere closer to the middle having swung over the last 60 years from the left hand side from a  heavily US dominated world after WWII to one where the US is starting to lose some of that dominance to China. This is most visible in the economic realm.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that as power concentrates (as we move to the left side of spectrum) there is more and more stability. Stability in the aggregate sense, there may well be regions opposing this concentration, regional conflicts and wars are an example of this. In aggregate however stability and power concentration together ushers in an era where control flows to the entity. There are macro and micro examples of this everywhere. China as a country is an example where there is strong concentration of power and high stability although this waxes and wanes. Another example might be a new manager that just entered a recently restructured company, she has both low-power and low-stability. The reason stability is worth mentioning is because power concentration changes over time and stability is generally the leading indicator of that change, instability signals a power concentration change as it flows to another entity or perhaps re-acquired by the original entity.\n\nAny entity that enters an era of new found power and stability always will exercise that power, it is the form of execution that varies, benevolent dictators chose to exercise that power in a benign form. In this new era both the power holders as well as the subjects of power will begin to mould their environment into one that efficient based on the form of power deployed. i.e. China has a rule by law system where all things are subservient to the ideology of social homogeneity and social cohesion/stability and China achieves this via rule by law.\n\nNow money maybe an amoral instrument but the systems of control around money will be always subservient to the ideology of the entity that controls power. China's banking system is ultimately beholden to the government, via rule by law, of whatever the government's aims are. In China’s case the primary goal is social cohesion and stability. This is in contrast to the US's banking system which developed around a government that had a founding ideology of freedom hence a relentless background push for deregulation.\n\nIn an environment where I have little freedom and choice (higher power) and there’s no widespread discontent (high stability), the natural inclination of the populous will be to operate in a manner that’s most efficient for the environment. That is rely on the trusted entity, examples can be use WeChat for all payment, invest in government sanctioned assets… A person in this world might say \"why would I be interested in an asset class that is most valuable in an distributed trust-less world, my world is very trusted in fact there’s only one entity controlling most aspects of my collectivist society! Also what if my government came down with a ban-hammer on this stuff then I would lose everything.\" There will always be renegades in any society but the volume is just too small to make a difference not to collectivist societies are incentivised to cure renegades. Now if the whole world is just China, there would be a very low value for something like BTC because the wider populous has no need for this. Now if the populous is discontent and a rebellion is forming (low stability & high power) you can start to see a path where a non-centralised asset class becomes very valuable.\n\nTo be continued in Part 2 when I get some time, in the rest of this series I plan to cover \"Turmoil and price\" and \"Historical parallels\".", "timestamp": 1633734161, "digest": "Mw22Q_QXgGEqJ6HVaO74BkFod52bQ8tCLPTgOpiKn08", "contributor": "0x2a41D6d9f24F4a1458F1072e83f40736f43eF16c"}

It was like she was a “probie” of a Strasse-crew, waiting for a chance to throw back some hits and kicks, and make points with bosses.\n\n”I’m coming Mama, I just have to get the last of this gear on.”\n\nFernanda made sure the last of the service issue fatigues configured themselves to her body. Standard issue nanos and algos ran boot-up routines and the suit molded itself to her and became a second skin. She was the image of Mars Infantry.\n\nA slight pinching was the most she felt as the start-up procudure integrated her body and parts of her cortex to her unit’s “stack”. She was in now. No going back. The pinching ended, suit done.\n\n“Come sit down, ingermica, sit. No telling when you eat again.”\n\n”Yes Mama.” \n\nFernanda thought about the breakfast she already had with her ‘crew’ down by the shipyards, her “farewell feast” and her instructions to her number 2. With luck, they wouldn’t mess it up, her trusty would make sure her Mama would be looked after, and nobody from other crews would even scan their business. \n\nWhen this Long War was over, she could come out of hiding, stop playing “soldier”, and get back to business at the ‘yards.\n\n“I made your favorites, Ingermica. No telling what kind of half-Earther food they feed you.” Her mother hid her worry. \n\n”Oh this food smells so good.” Fernanda wasn’t hungry but she ate everything. \n\nMama was right, no telling when exactly she would eat home food. The Long War might be going short but no telling.\n\n**1987 EARTH**\n\nFor a long time the financial markets were in the dumps, until 1982.\n\nSure, there was the “Roaring 20s” and “Go Go” 60s, but there was also the Depression, WW II, a Cold War that got hot in Asia (twice), and the 1970s malaise of post-Vietnam, OPEC and stagflation.\n\nThe best & brightest avoided “Wall Street” but time erased past sins. Memories shortened. White shoe firms grew grey hairs, and a new breed was taking over. Their love language were big deals. \n\nThe Big 80s included mergers, “hostile takeovers”, and lots of debt. Tax policies made deals “doable” with interest deductions. But bankers had to “raise debt” in the first place. Interest rates and USD were higher, the market drifted lower a little bit by September, and worries were rising on the “Street”. \n\nDan Rostenkowski, chair of the House Ways & Means Committee, looked at cutting deals’ tax-breaks. The worries were piling up. \n\nThe “bulls” ran for 5 years - the “Dow Jones” had tripled. Funds wanted to lock in profits in case. “Portfolio Insurance” was the answer. Brokers could “short” the S&P 500 index through computer programs, at the first sign of trouble. \n\nMachines would take over.\n\nBy mid-October 1987, “Mr. Market” was getting nervous. The week ended with no word about this new tax change. Selling picked up. A new Fed Chairman, Greenspan, cut rates but it was too late.\n\nThe Asian markets got nervous over the weekend. Monday morning, panic mood became panic selling. The mutual funds had to honor redemptions. Then came “portfolio insurance” shorting the market. The “Dow” dropped 23% on Monday, Oct. 19, 1987.\n\nNext day, the Fed pulled some strings but the machines stayed.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eU9RNkycbXfROm3hvk_CB.png?height=1600&width=1200)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Pqpd2da4Zbp8qu5-9aWWC.png?height=1600&width=1200)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633735335, "digest": "mersKrQzHt5jkDqdoww0XU6IrlChTNwxtpHRNb_7_X0", "contributor": "0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f"}

{"id": "QSHe8mUAkW0qZRgA1mZg_u9ius1e0JbTtCPb2W_8RK4", "title": "An Introduction to Land DAO", "body": "After deriving much joy from writing [An Introduction To The FVCKRENDERVERSE//](https://medium.com/@poes.eth/an-introduction-to-the-fvckrenderverse-6dc6a0cf5347) (*which will definitely see a Part 2 as the ‘verse expands in the near future*), I must say I got the bug back. The writing bug that is.\n\nAnd as it turned out, not long after publishing that very article, an anon internet friend reached out to me about a DAO ([a decentralised autonomous organisation](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/)) that pretty much made me drop everything mid-workout to race home and mint (*something that would usually only happen for life-threatening emergencies––or when I get hungry*).\n\nJokes aside, his pitch came down to this:\n\n* **An** **art commission DAO**, bringing established artists into the NFT space for exclusive drops.\n* **Revenue sharing models** that benefit artists, members, collectors and the treasury alike.\n* **Maximum 256 members** by referral only to ensure a quality community base (with a later potential expansion), built around well-connected and experienced founders and advisors.\n\nNow, when he told me the mint price for the DAO membership token was 2 ETH (±$7k at that time), I’m not going to lie, I put my gym shorts back on. Regardless of low supply, that’s a lot of ETH for a mint.\n\nLet alone for the fact that I had to send my anon internet friend this 2 ETH (+gas) to mint on my behalf, as apparently the devs were already asleep (*cries in European*) and there were only <25 mints left at that point.\n\n![Needless to say, I love my anon internet friends (he even sent the residual ETH back❤️) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CtuwKUrgKmySOAmMO06-c.png?height=116&width=1241)\n\nLucky for me, my anon internet friends are as sound as my non-anon IRL friends and he still got me my Land in the nick of time.\n\n![Upgradeable in the future, this is Land in its current, most basic form.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fvGo41d5s_SaXWmxmHlT6.png?height=2864&width=4096)\n\n## Land Ahoy!\n\nJumping off from what my friend pitched me, **[Land DAO](https://landdao.io)** was created with the vision of funding world-class, established artists, enabling them to focus solely on their craft, where **the DAO works to provide them with software development as well as a distribution ecosystem to enable them to kickstart their NFT journey.**\n\nAs part of this kickstart, every **Land DAO** curated artist receives **an** **upfront commission of typically ±$50k** (*paid in ETH from the treasury*) and **a perpetual 2.5% secondary sales revenue**, alongside the **marketing, distribution, customer service and product & community management** being taken care of by the DAO.\n\nThe DAO itself operates using a governance model implemented with the Land tokens. Individuals who own lands **are able to influence governance proposal votes, participate in private DAO conversations & claim proportional shares of DAO revenues**.\n\n### The Genesis Launch\n\nTo illustrate (*no pun intended*), for the **Genesis launch** on Friday September 24, **[James Peter Henry](https://jamespeterhenry.com)** (who Aussies might just know for his **UN World Ocean Day** commissioned piece where [his work was displayed on the ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G40NZrI_53I)**[Sydney Opera House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G40NZrI_53I)** this past June) released his “**[Cartel](https://landdao.io/cartel.html)**” series:\n\n![Cartel #1067 \"The Puppet\" (owned by yours truly)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Zu9gbfYFEyrWUki-avFmV.png?height=691&width=500)\n\n*“The spirit of Cartel was forged in the aboriginal caves of the Australian Outback where James spent his childhood. In the heart of Medellin, Cartel physically manifested as James observed and experienced, first hand, the human toll of the cartel miasma. He sought to capture the pain, the anguish, the desperation, and the sinister glee. The collection consists of 7 Cartel members whose silhouettes serve as the base for 1,256 generative NFTs.”*\n\n**The 1,256 piece generative collection sold out within 20 minutes at a whopping 0.5 ETH per mint and has since generated 530+ ETH in secondary volume in its first three weeks on OpenSea.**\n\nA cool 13.2 ETH (±$47.7k at time of writing) of this volume going back to James of course!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s4gW66bDF9Hn0bFPTldNs.png?height=344&width=609)\n\n*\\[On a personal note, as the Cartel pictured above has been the first and only NFT my better half (who is herself an artist and ever so lightly NFT-sceptic) has green lit to hang in the living room, I was not surprised by the quick sell-out at all\\]*\n\nIt’s probably also good to mention that of those 1,256 pieces, **256 were minted for free by Land owners as one of the perks of being part of the DAO**. Nevertheless, a 500 ETH sell-out of a 1,000 piece primary sale in 20 minutes is nothing to scoff at!\n\nThis 500 ETH primary sale revenue was then divided, with **10% (i.e. 50 ETH) going to the treasury** to fund future launches and **90% (i.e. 450 ETH) going to Land owners at ±1.76 ETH per land**, immediately available to be claimed.\n\n**The age of productive digital assets is upon us.**\n\n![The total yield of 1.76 ETH claimable for my address after the Cartel public sale.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JBLwU-GaCtxSL8DQYBeu-.jpg?height=954&width=1029)\n\n### Governing the Land\n\nPart of the beauty of DAOs to me is that it is **an extremely efficient way of aligning incentives amongst a group of mostly anonymous people working asynchronously across the globe.**\n\nIt also allows this same group of people to **pool and deploy capital easier than ever before**, all while **communicating across moderated, categorised channels** (mostly on Discord), with **governance proposals being voted on through Snapshot**.\n\nAs a concrete example of such a vote, [Land DAO’s first snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/landdao.eth/proposal/QmPwzGEQXC7RCqMssWSa9vSDnW62wCdLuT1auaLaziMATZ) was for the introduction of “ORE” as an ERC-20 base currency to reward collectors.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PRq838LjThWF76_r1xSAf.png?height=555&width=877)\n\nSince [Land DAO has already published an article on the mechanics and benefits of ORE](https://medium.com/@land_dao/land-dao-ore-token-abe3d22b79b5), I won’t dive too deeply into that.\n\nOne part that is worth mentioning is that collectors will receive ORE from collection pieces to either (1) **receive a priority, discount or free mint pass** for the next drop, or (2) commit the ORE to a burn pool so the collector can **claim their proportional share of primary sales revenue in ETH after the next drop**.\n\nBecause where for the Cartel launch the public sale revenue share was a 90/10 split between land owners and treasury, [in the last governance vote](https://snapshot.org/#/landdao.eth/proposal/QmRG8QUhQwveqreGs5Enx43S6WTWA6irm3X7QftJckYkes), **an overwhelming 96.75% voted to dilute their yield to allow collectors a 10% piece of the pie as well**, bringing the split to 85/10/5 between Land owners, ORE burners and the treasury.\n\n![An overview of perks after the last governance vote](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eTxRkVeg6uHN-3JwrHztz.png?height=223&width=1348)\n\n### JUST TELL ME WHAT ALL OF THIS MEANS TO ME ALREADY\n\nOkay, well, let’s say that hypothetically the next drop were to yield another 500 ETH from the primary sale and that 25% of all ORE were committed to the burn pool beforehand to collect 10% of the revenue.\n\n**ORE generated from a single cartel would then yield the collector ±0.14 ETH, while ORE generated from a full set (all 7 Cartel members) would yield ±1.37 ETH!**\n\n![Estimates of ORE generated after the Cartel launch and yield per % of ORE committed](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NBqSKhUDgqaXyv1pWy4NJ.png?height=461&width=755)\n\n## Soft Perks of a DAO\n\nThe aspects of DAOs that easily get overshadowed by talks of governance tokens, exclusive drops, yield, etc. are the soft perks that are often much more defining of the overall experience of partaking in a DAO.\n\nMy favourite by far is **being part of an inclusive, passionate and fully aligned community.** Part of the DAO? You’re family now. Here’s hundreds of new friends that  have your back.\n\nAs an example, I’ve seen DAO members rally together to recover the stolen NFTs of another member. I’ve seen DAO members hire people during the pandemic who had just lost their livelihoods. I’ve even seen DAO members send thousands in donations to another member who had (verifiably) fallen on hard times.\n\nFor Land DAO this is no different.

\n 正文：\n\n2017年已经接近尾声，这意味着老吴在币圈又一个年头了。前几日正值平安夜，大家都在群里讨论吃没吃苹果，我才让我意识到，哇，一年又快过去了。接近年末，总想写点什么总结一下得失，2017年，真的是值得纪念的一年。从2017年年初开始，小蚁打头阵，元界直接上了40倍的涨幅，接下来量子紧紧跟随，然后黄金链一出，轰动整个圈子。一时，满天飞的项目遮住了我们的眼睛。泡沫疯狂的涌起，一个项目三五倍都是打底，动不动就几十倍让人眼花缭乱。这真是一个神奇的圈子，2017年这个圈子大戏不断上演，每天都有故事，每天都是精彩：有人在这前半年万八千的本金，赚了将近千万；有人在后半年从八位数的身价亏得一毛不剩；有人终于看到一夜暴富的希望，从各个行业奔赴区块链，开始做自己都不懂的乱七八糟的应用；也也有人笑看风云，到处站站台讲讲话就赚几个亿又捐出去了的。现在，这个行业正在经历着前所未有的风波，未来如何，是好是坏，无法预知，世界变化太快，我们能做的就是不断提升自己的认知和适应能力。相信，未来终将属于他想要变成的模样，任何力量都是阻挡不了的。\n\n我不知道正在看这篇文章的您，今年收获如何。老吴深以为，成大事业者，必然是懂得深刻复盘的，该放下K线和盘面，好好思考下得与失了。2017年，比特币扩容的纷争贯穿了大半年；2017年，中国的监管冷不丁来一次爆炸性的七部委联合发文监管；2017年，牛市大跃进伴随着走熊的声音不绝于耳，早期入市早已有赚得盆满钵满者，造富神话接踵而来，当然也有各种投资亏损的段子博人一笑。\n\n**老吴一年的心得，全在文中了，现在看来，竟然都是金玉良言：币之行，静以修身，囤以养财，非淡泊无以明志，非拿死不能发财啊！**\n\n为啥这么说，因为大多数人，都习惯于猫和老鼠的游戏，都习惯于散户与庄家的博弈，**散户和庄家，隔得远吗？不远，也就是心态上的一点差别而已。散户和庄家，隔得近吗？可不近，隔着一个世纪的沉稳与认知呢。所以，你得好好看下这篇文！**\n\n## 第一部分：\n\n最近因为研究数字货币的缘故，偶尔会在微博上发表一些言论，所以粉丝剧增，同时，微博上也有粉丝在拼命留言，让我给大家操作建议，比如买了量子链啊，瑞波啊，小蚁啊，问我近期会不会涨。或者让我预测一下，哪些币近期会有利润，甚至直接问我能涨多少，而且口气还都不客气。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QVbDB36WsH00IttpsGm0b.jpg?height=547&width=895)\n\n可笑。如果这我都能预测，我自己还做什么程序开发，还学习什么区块链？我还做个什么鬼公司，我直接成神了啊。 \n \n\n一来，我明确告诉你们，你们问的问题，我也不知道，我没时间每天去分析那些玩意，我喜欢逮着一个币，就抓住不放。所以那些连币本身是什么含义，是哪些项目做支撑都不知道，就来问我你买的币是不是一定会涨，你特么问关二爷去更靠谱。我反正不会回答你。 \n \n\n二来，我本职工作还是做软件开发和底层建设的，多余时间，我更喜欢去认识很多链圈的大佬，一来提升了学习认知，二来积累了不少顶层人脉，我觉得这样更有意义。 \n \n\n三来，我告诉你，你赚了钱，就有用了？最后的结果你还是会亏光，你信不？然后你那时候再来倒打一耙，我曹，都是你比特吴，搞得我现在亏了这么多钱。比特吴就是个大骗子。 \n \n\n看到没，这就是所谓的韭菜逻辑！就像下面这个聊天记录，有耐心的时候我会告诉你，没耐心，我可能直接把你拉黑，省的以后倒打一耙。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AjKnsmG2BJp417uw_iZGI.jpg?height=897&width=385)\n\n## 第二部分：\n\n这样吧，为了更透彻的说明这个问题，我从一部电视剧说起吧，这部电视剧，拍出来有些年月了，但是你估计都没听说过，因为实在是太没名气，也没啥人看。没名气，是因为作为一部电视剧，他拍的太怪异，所以无法成为热点。没人看，是因为大多数人看了一集就看不下去了，不知道他在讲啥。\n\n但是喜欢他的人极其喜欢，推荐我看这部电视剧的，是我一网友。这位网友是一高人，八零后，赶上了2008年的那一轮大牛市。笑呵呵的就把钱给赚了，年纪轻轻就赚的盆满钵满。可惜也是因为年纪轻，没把握好，遭遇滑铁卢，落魄回乡。但是好歹瘦死的骆驼比马大，哥们这几年一直在反思自己决策的失误和人性的弱点。那天见面，我们在一个饺子馆聊了一下午，他中间和我提到这部片，说他失败的那一年开始看，然后每年都会看一遍。现如今他又起来了，又成为了响当当的金融大亨，坐拥财富帝国，但是还是会每年都看。9年，他看了不下九遍。\n\n不喜欢他的人，基本上看完开头就觉得完全无法看下去，因为这玩意太诡异，根本不像一部正常的电视剧。我佩服导演拍他时候的勇气，因为他拍的时候就一定知道，这部电视剧，注定不会有收视率，因为注定大多数人是看不懂的，看不懂那就是一种煎熬。但是他需要拍出来，来演绎最为真实的人性。不卖关子了，这部电视剧，叫《天道》。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/75o81IkAE6wPoO2pHwvUg.jpg?height=928&width=809)\n\n故事主线很简单，一位大神级别的私募操盘手，躲到一小山村隐居，和一位漂亮的女警察搞上了。女警察说服他送自己一份礼物，这份礼物很奇怪，女警察知道两个人之间有太多的认知鸿沟无法逾越，以后必定不能在一起，所以希望这位隐居哥给他留个念想，这个念想，就是让隐居哥把一个贫困县里的贫困村给她弄富裕了，她想看看这些穷人们改变自己的命运。隐居哥本来不喜欢过问世事，但是为了眼前这位圣洁的妹纸，还是忍不住答应了这事儿，然后带着三位村里的乡民小弟，我勒个擦，咱们和村子一起嗨起来吧。\n\n这位隐居哥，是一位洞悉人性的高手。\n\n \n 他虽洞悉人心人性，熟知社会规律，却偏偏不肯接受这些。这导致他成为一个纠结之人。明明可以心平气和，却非要把自己弄成狗都嫌的落拓男，大概的意思是想让自己远离繁华，以便于更近距离的接近智慧。\n\n话说这隐居哥带着三位小弟，成立了一家音响公司，一开始，高高兴兴风风火火的干起来了。他们觉得仗着隐居哥这样的高人出主意倒腾资本，一定能赚的盆满钵满。但是慢慢的，三位小弟觉得这尼玛不对啊，隐居哥虽然出主意，但是为啥出的都是馊主意呢？他们私下议论着这可不行，咱们可都是拿了钱占了股份的，隐居哥那是外围操盘而已，输了也不管他啥事儿，但是他这样乱搞一气，我们肯定会吃亏呢。\n\n说时迟那时快，在隐居哥的胡搞乱搞下，一家巨头把他们的音响公司告上法庭，要诉讼他们赔偿600万，我勒个擦，三位小弟疯了，顿时崩溃，脸都吓白了，立马开始哭闹上吊起来，无论如何在最后关头，把自己的股份退了，算是保住了一点小钱。\n\n结果竟然完全出乎意料，三位小弟，发现自己傻逼了，官司在最后竟然出现了反转，如果没退股的话，他们的资产都已经翻了好几番，这无异于，从一个无名小辈，变成了受人尊重的中产阶级，但是可惜三个小弟全错失了这个机会，最后有个小弟还自杀了。为啥自杀？这件事太残酷了，让你如此接近自己的巅峰，让你从井底爬到井沿儿，然后扒着看一眼再一下子把你扣进井底不得超生，难道还不残酷吗？\n\n好，我今天也懒得剧透，想看详细内容的，自己去看。我就想说说这三个小弟，三个乡民。为何就是如此下场？有人逼他们吗？没有！有人套路他们吗？也没有。那到底是什么让三位老乡在离财富最近的那一刻，又选择了退出呢？\n\n难道你，就有没有一丝熟悉的感觉？\n\n**三位乡民，像极了股市反弹前夕，选择割肉的你。难道不是吗？**\n\n**三位乡民，像极了任何事物都把希望寄托在别人身上结果输的一塌糊涂的你，难道不是吗？**\n\n**三位乡民，像极了孤注一掷，赌徒心理成就赌徒命运的你，难道不是吗？**\n\n## 第三部分\n\n鄙人不才，在金融界戎马倥偬非常六加一载。年岁不长，但是经历的起起伏伏多，我庆幸自己在金融的浑水里淌了个来回，看到了太多关乎人性，关乎成败的精彩人生，有时候，明白一些道理，提升一些认知，可能比钱本身更有价值\n\n从2010年到现在，金融市场仿佛经历了几个轮回，从股票到债券，从黄金到外汇，从现货到期货，从贵金属到原油，从邮币卡到微交易，从商业荐股到黄金外盘，从拆分盘到比特币，从私募基金到P2P，从信托理财到私募股权基金，从币圈火爆到现在的区块链ICO盛行……\n\n我虽然并非每一个都参与过，但是每一个我都眼睁睁的看到过，就好像是，见惯了太多潮起潮落、人聚人散、悲喜轮回。每一次大潮来袭，都会成就一大批富豪。而每一次的退潮，却血流成河，尸横遍野，像极了《天道》里，最后走到高楼孤独自杀的刘冰，他并非有多大过错，但是比有些人的牺牲就是注定的，只是生在底层，认知在更底层，命运谈何改变呢？说这个，是因为想引出下面的一个观点：千万不要让自己成为韭菜思维，一旦成为韭菜思维，那你就注定只能被消灭，不能被教化！\n\n \n **第四部分**\n\n《天道》里，三位老铁，在最紧要关头，在K线最为关键的一个反弹点，选择了割肉退出。错失了最好的一波财富机会。说白了，这三位老铁，就是股市和币圈里面，实打实的散户实打实的韭菜。而且这三位很惨，是因为有内幕消息，才杀进来的，结果因为自己认知不足，被踢出局。普通人，都无法接受这样的心理冲击，毕竟谁都不愿意承认自己是傻子。 \n \n\n三位老铁，在自己认知的世界里，没有觉得哪里出了错，但是就是看不懂这个局，看不懂隐居哥为何要选择一条这样的路，直到他们退出，打回原形。想到前几天遇到的一件事儿：一个微博粉丝在17号晚上问我，重仓了ETH，然后连续这么多天的下跌，让他无法承受，问我是否选择割掉。哥们是2200左右入手，17号晚上最低的时候跌倒960，如果在1000割掉的话，已经亏了差不多55%，说实话，很痛。这不是他第一次问我这个问题，每一次我给他的建议，都是让他不要急于割肉，他每次都告诉我他的看法，他说这K线震荡下行，波澜不惊的，恐怕没有回天之力 \n \n\n这很正常，散户一般都是看K线组合来决定买还是卖。所谓，一根阴线改变情绪，两根阴线改变预期，三根阴线改变信仰。\n\n但是认怂归认怂，ETH的行情，选择在17号晚上割掉，显然不太合理。加密数字货币这玩意，是基于区块链开发的应用，他并非是股票，他的消息面是远大于技术面的。我多次让哥们去学习下区块链的相关知识，深度了解下加密数字货币的底层技术，哥们永远都是拒绝的。因为他只关心，和他有关的涨跌，到底能不能赚钱。认知提升，和知识的充裕，对他来说，觉得太无趣。那说白了，他以为他是在做技术分析，其实他还是在赌博。赌博必定是输钱，因为赌博要是还能赢钱，就不符合天道了，谁还去劳动学习呢 \n \n\n他当然是赌输了。\n\n就在他割肉出货的那天晚上，ETH大涨，接下来几天直冲1700，而他，选择的是亏损40万出货。\n\n## 第五部分\n\n这位老铁，就是《天道》里面的三位老铁！典型的活在自己的世界里，无法自拔，自以为自己的认知就是全世界的认知。他不懂为何要去了解更深层次的东西，不懂为何要花时间去提升自己的认知。他以为，他靠着一点技术分析，就能成大事。如果这么简单，那些教你股票分析的书，肯定早就买脱销了，那些散户又是哪里来的呢？追涨杀跌又是为何呢？世界是有他的规律的，一切的成功一定是符合规律发展的，道法自然、如来而已。你要搞清楚的重点在于这个道法的自然，而不是去研究K线和浮于表面的东西。\n\n在社会心理学中最具影响力的著作《乌合之众》中，有这样一段话：**群众从来就没有渴望过真理，面对那些不合口味的证据，他们会拂袖而去。假如谬论对他们有诱惑力，他们更愿意崇拜谬论。**多有道理啊，凡是能向他们供应幻觉的，就很容易地成为他们的主人；凡是让他们幻觉破灭的，都会成为他们的牺牲品。\n\n这让我想起曾仕强教授关于他的《帝王学》课程。有人问他，以您的影响力传播帝王学，那么，学成之后，人人都是帝王了，那谁还会做平民呢？他老人家笑了笑说，就算一千人学了帝王学，也大概没有一个人能成为帝王。该是平民的，还是平民。\n\n**我坚信了：大众自有宿命。有句话很经典，散户不能被教育，只能被消灭。**想到这里，我就放心了。所以，我丝毫不担心，通过我个人的奔走呼告，能让散户得到救赎。就算极少数人，从散户晋升为精英，也无法改变整个群体的生态环境。\n\n任何一个群体，总有80%的普通人，10%的精英和10%的傻叉。我们虽然没有能力改变这种生态结构，但要努力成为那10%一份子。当然，不是傻叉那部分。想不成为傻叉，想不被消灭，其实并不难：就是不与芸芸大众为一类，不与芸芸大众为一种思维方式，人与人最大的不同，就是思维方式的不同，你认知高于他们，他们的钱就活该被你赚走。\n\n**如何能不被消灭？其实就只有三点：**\n\n**第一，看清行业，摸透本质，聆听资讯，找到方法。（学习）**\n\n**第二，爬出井底，浮出水面，顶层人脉，一手信息。（人脉）**\n\n**第三，提升认知，找到规律，一往无前，大杀四方。（实战）**\n\n**一、学习其根本，找到其门道（学习）**\n\n为了说清楚这个道理，我想说说一个金融这几年很火的事件，叫非法集资。\n\n可能四年前他并非叫做非法集资，他还叫做互联网金融。没有见识过2013年和2014年互联网金融热的人，可能想象不到曾经有这么一种现象。全国各地，互联网金融公司雨后春笋搬冒了出来。可能转眼你家旁边的门面，全都变成了某某财富机构，里面装修的和银行一个样。你隔壁家找不到工作的阿猫阿狗，全都摇身一变成为高级理财经理或者销售总监。一波接一波的理财热潮，让人眼花缭乱，一个又一个的公司摇身一变，都成了互联网金融大咖。包装一两个神，租上当地最豪华的写字楼，马上就可以开始几千万几千万的融资，这个市场都疯了，大家都知道老百姓的钱好拿，各类奸商成群结队的来进行忽悠。\n\n那么问题来了，老百姓真的这么好忽悠吗？\n\n要说非法集资很复杂吗？复杂个屁，非法集资，无非就是包装一个或者一系列高大上的项目，面向大众集资，许以高额利息，然后新钱付旧息。等到利息与日俱增，而新钱流入不够，就会东窗事发，或被抓、或跑路，无一例外。几句话就可以解释的事情，怎么还有这么多人上当受骗？我身边在各类金融投资上面大面积亏损的人，就大有人在，他们都不傻，有很多还都是高级知识分子，大学教授医生。为何看不出来这么简单的骗局？\n\n我问过他们，他们大多数都有这么三个理论：\n\n1，项目看起来很靠谱，有名人做背书呢。\n\n2，前面几期的钱都如数兑现了。\n\n3，我时刻关注他们公司，我就住他们公司附近的，我每天都去看，所以最后就算出问题，我会第一时间退出来。\n\n这样问题就来了，为什么你会被坑进去？**就只有一个原因，你懒得去学习其精髓，懒得去了解其本质。你根本就是把希望寄托在了别人身上。**你和《天道》里的刘冰一样，寄希望于隐居哥，从来都没想过靠自己的能力去挣钱，去成就自己，每天想的都是依靠他人。如果他人错了，反而是骂的最厉害的那一个，如果他人对了，就屁颠屁颠的当个跟屁虫。\n\n什么叫项目看起来很靠谱？谁告诉你的？只是你希望别人的项目靠谱而已，我告诉你，很有可能根本就没有这个项目，别人包装出来坑你的。什么叫前面都兑现了？这也可以当做投资依据？这就好比你和一个强奸犯出去，你的依据是他前面几天都没强奸过人呢。然后你坦然的跟人钻了小树林？那不是弱智嘛。\n\n你关注那些公司有用？别人公司要跑路，还要做准备？还要搞点动静？跑路就是一瞬间的事，可能一个小时前，别人还在嗨，一个小时后就啥都没有了。武汉市有个《盛世财富》牛逼的很，11月底带着投资人泡温泉搞会销，会销上倡导要规范发展，带领大家走向新时代，送iPhone，送电脑，搞了几千万的业绩，12月初，老板直接去自首了。这样的套路，你不哭死 \n \n\n可惜了，你完全不愿意自己去了解，懒得把行业看透，就迷迷糊糊的自己的命运寄托在别人身上，你就和一个傻子没啥区别，那你只能等死，如果活了一辈子这个道理都没弄明白，被骗了活该。\n\n**玩金融，之所以大多数人沦为韭菜，并非其他，只是因为大多数人，都不愿意去学习本质，更不愿意去相信规律，而只懂得去依靠别人。**\n\n也许，是见惯了金融行业的各种血雨腥风，也许，是受诸多良师益友的投资理念影响。我早已习惯于每天不间断的学习行业内容，然后以充分怀疑、严谨分析、谨慎相信的态度，来看待这个行业里的林林总总。所以如果你看到这篇文章，我希望，你也一样，**做任何投资，先学习，先学习，先学习，不要被轻易诱惑。**\n\n**二、爬出井底，找准人脉（人脉） \n **\n\n《天道》开头就有这样一幕，隐居哥从德国回来的时候，和往日老友在酒店喝酒叙旧。 \n \n\n这位老友，正在竞争总裁之位，可惜的是，前面还有两位重量级大佬，这扛把子想当，估摸着是有点难了。隐居哥三杯酒下肚，给老友指点说，你竞争个毛线，你直接宣布退出，然后你就等着坐上总裁之位吧。 \n \n\n老友忧心忡忡，啥意思？我退出还可以坐上总裁之位？你丫喝醉了吧 \n \n\n隐居哥说，我可没喝醉，你宣布退出，然后好好做实事儿，排在你前面的两个对手就会相互咬起来，最后必然是两败俱伤，谁也做不成事。大家又看到你在做实事儿，所以你就可以不战而胜。\n\n老友不解的问：如果他们两个不相互咬呢？ \n \n\n隐居哥说，咱说的是人性。除非他们不是人，是人铁定相互咬。\n\n——事情的发展，果如隐居哥所断，排在前面的两个竞争对手互相撕咬的结果，是让排第三的老兄，毫无障碍的入主总裁之位。 \n \n\n**因为一个人，或者一句话，改变自己命运的人，不在少数。**\n\n有人说，这个世界上最好的投资，就是对人的投资。《原则》的作者RayDalio在书中让我们遵循的可信度加权的原则，也是基于我们先得有这么一个好的人脉去加权的基础之上才行！\n\n《大宅门》这部电视剧里，有这样一段剧情，白文氏眼光长远，早早的开始投资常公公，给他买房买妻妾，家里人都是完全不可以理解的。但是最后在百草堂命悬一线的时候，常公公这个重要人脉，救了整个大家族。投资一两个人脉，换来一家人平安，现实和电影中，这样的故事，太多了。\n\n那我们投资股票，投资数字货币，其实也是一个道理。老是一个韭菜在下面独乐乐，有什么意义呢？你应该走出去，趁着这个圈子还小，你完全可以接触到你投资的币种的CEO，或者其他高管。这些人脉，可能对于你的投资，有着至关重要的作用，难道不是吗？\n\n不要觉得互联网社会了，信息就是对称的。告诉你，**信息依然是严重不对称的**，就拿这次的比特币分叉来说，你获取的媒体信息，和真实信息的差别有多大，你可能永远都不会知道。但是如果你能在“圈内”混迹江湖，你的消息，可能价值百万。\n\n**还真不要觉得不可能，这个圈子比你想象得要小，任何路径都可能为你打开一扇窗口，就怕你不敢想。**这件事，我已经在前面做了，我也会为大家指引方向。\n\n \n \n\n**三、提升认知，大杀四方（实战）**\n\n估计写完这篇，又有人问了，我每天都在学习，我也在积累人脉，那就能赚到钱吗？\n\n一定不是的，那样你可能是一个纸上谈兵的高手，但是距离脱胎换骨，你还缺少一些实战。\n\n实战，说白了，就是心态的培养，让自己不至于快速沦为散户，沦为韭菜。这个过程，你得学会在实战中找方法，培养自己的心态，提升自己的认知。\n\n如果没有前面两条作为铺垫，实战，会很痛。\n\n但是如果你要走这条路，就要清晰的预测到这种痛，和你能承受的极限。\n\n人只有在痛苦中才能快速成长。\n\n我以为，**如果方向不对，那么，早点失败就是一件好事，总比晚点失败好。**现在回头来看，我的几段大起大落的经历，对我来说，最大的意义在于，帮助我成功转变了投资的理念，极大的提升了自己的认知。有句话是这么说的：**凡事发生必有其目的，并且有助于我。我深以为然。我们每个人都有一套自己的思维理念。这个理念很有可能是错误的，很有可能根本就不符合世界发展的规律。想要改变，就必须得实战。而经历，才是实战的基础。**\n\n再把话说回来，到《天道》里，为什么那三位乡民，隐居哥的三个小弟，就成了我们所说的散户呢？典型的追涨杀跌，典型的井底之蛙。话说当时音响官司完了后，对方的律师怎么都想不通，为啥这么大胜算的官司，对方三个股东竟然在前夜退出，这不是明摆着天上掉下来的馅饼接不住吗？\n\n**其实事实很简单：退股的三个股东，一是有天然的认知差，二是他们没有自己的人脉圈子和可以交流的思想，三是他们之前也没经历过这种事儿。这不就是认知、人脉、实战的三大坎吗？**\n\n他们接受的都是简单教育，形成了三个简单认知，而且这个认知无比的固定在自己的脑海，还不愿意改变：\n\n——他们相信事实胜于雄辩，这是第一个简单。\n\n——他们相信疑罪从有，这是第二个简单。\n\n——他们相信有个青天大老爷明察秋毫，这是第三个简单。\n\n但是真实情况，完全不是这样的。**事情发展会遵循整个体制的规律，会遵循整个社会的规律，所谓的事实，可能只是你看到的事实，所谓的疑罪从有，那只是表面上却不是无法改变的，所谓的青天大老爷明察秋毫，那只是一个梦想，难道不是吗？你得与这个世界合拍，而不是于自己落后的思维方式合拍。（这就是实事求是见路不走的精髓）**\n\n \n 人类社会就是这样子的，诸多主观事实搅和在一起。如果你不服，固执的想要公道，那还是回火星吧。《天道》里三位老铁最终是败在了自己的认知上，黄河三尺鲤，本在孟津居。点额不成龙，归来伴凡鱼——正是这三个简单的认知，让他们站在财富城堡门前，却叹口气，掉头跳回到认知的深井里。井下虽狭，污秽肮脏，但那是他们简单的头脑，唯一能够理解的天地。所以他们哪怕是认识了高人，也无法跳进龙门。** \n **\n\n不管是炒股还是炒币，我那网友纵横金融界多年，告诉过我一句话：散户，只能被消灭，无法被教育。这不，这两天币市的交易情况再次证明了：散户啥都敢买，散户无所畏惧！散户威武霸气！不管是什么币，什么ICO，只要有财富效应，无脑的往前冲冲冲，那样子，极其壮观。神奇的追涨杀跌，每天都在发生。\n\n我就了：你的，你们的钱都是浪打来的吗？还有什么是你们不敢买的？不过，骂归骂，他话还是妹妹得好好说。闷菜继续永远是韭菜，韭菜是因为他们一时毅的天韭菜：和《逍遥乡》里探乡民，在世人的脸面，永远选择固执见见，不肯接受新的自己。\n\n比如，明知道参与追涨杀跌，神像的演讲高达 90%，却仍然视而​​不见、乐此不疲。而，非散户就大不一样了。 ，地深渊，他就脱离了高尚的人，成为一个高尚的人，当上CEO，赢取白富美低，走上人生巅峰。\n\n**，在任何事实或者新的存在是选择不变还是改变，就是散户与非散户的分界点。**\n\n拥有自己非散户、即将走上人生巅峰的人，有一个共同点：当他们遇到一个新的会，自我于极限，勇于掐灭旧罪，勇于为新腾出心灵的空间。重要的是，他们于为新的而而似！另一半人，固步自封，愿意成长。这样可以让你无法成长。\n\n所以，**实战能帮助我们的，就是不断的想要升级，就是不断的想要升级，选择。**\n\n \n **第六部分**\n\n所以不要再不停地问我，什么币会涨，你买的币，不能翻倍。我也不知道，再问我特么拉黑你。\n\n理解币圈的基础，是认识，理解理论的基础，是理解自我，当你深刻了解世界的复杂性，世界的复杂性会很简单，炒币很容易。 \n \n\n**任何事情，都是简单的后，才能赚到钱。**\n\n**你连基本的知识逻辑都没有，我告诉你哪个币会暴涨什么用呢？ \n **\n\n如果你做了一件事，感觉越来越兴奋，肯定是路子走错了嘛！\n\n我们，坚持，真的是你们想团结。\n\n争即是不争，不争即是争。\n\n一生极选对一个伴侣，近选对一个企业，最近富一次，便已社交！\n\n**曾国荃打下天京后，曾国藩给那个桀骜不驯的九弟写了一句：百战归来再读书。**\n\n**格也把这句话寄给朋友们在资本市场上征战的所有：适时，停下手，去读点书。**\n\n**所以，你该在最一次的时候，停下手，好好学习，去大海人脉，然后找准的机会，你，就成了人中龙凤**：\n\n第一，看清，摸透本质，学习知识，找到方法。（）\n\n第二，爬出井，浮出水面，底人脉，一手信息。（人脉）\n\n第三，提升觉悟，初恋，一往无前，大杀四方。（实战）\n\n就像老戏《天道》所言，**智慧的本质，也很简单，说透了就是实事求是。**\n\n简单到了再简单的四个字，却开始着着的求索与不能。\n\n \n 你是愿意学习，一步步成为自己的圈子，再盔甲几番战斗结束，走向人生封顶；还是固步自在自己的井底喝水池，你自己选。\n\n2017年，已然过去，希望大家不要再当韭菜惘然而生了，自以为幸运，进了最容易赚到的土地，就不要迎着浪潮带来的好处被浪潮压在了大石头下面。还是那句话，韭菜和庄家，得远吗？不也就是孵化理念上的庄家远，韭菜和饮食，得近吗？可不近，隔着一个世纪的沉与知呢。吴希望自己的粉丝越来越优秀，所以请不要一直当韭菜！",

{"id": "Zbbd0siUdecSPutNl0S2w2rHkvrvblgbVbgUnZ_HPpk", "title": "Speed is not enough, why EVM based chains are just short-term acquisition channels for Ethereum", "body": "Disclaimer: I am no ETH maxi, ETH had less than 10% of my portfolio at the beginning of the year. Still sub 20% and is likely to stay that way until major developments in the balance of power.\n\nAt the time of writing Oct 2021, there’s a lot of excitement in the smart contract space about Ethereum competitors, notable ones with price runs being Avalanche and Polygon. Other competitors will be covered further down the article. In this article will be covering why speed is not a moat, developer incentives and user incentives.\n\n# Speed is not enough\n\nThe crux of my argument basically comes down to you cannot compete on speed in the medium/long run. For those that are competing on speed your competitor is no longer ETH but rather its various scaling solutions be it layer2 or otherwise.\n\nFast/Cheap EVM compatible transactions growth is a double edged sword, what gives you an influx of S-curve customers today is what takes your s-curve ramp tomorrow, unless you meaningfully differentiate. This is why today I effectively view EVM compatible chains that compete on speed as acquisition channels. But let’s explore the dynamics of this a bit more.\n\nThis is not an issue for the user facing dapps just their underlying chains. Once a dapp gains meaningful user and growth they will have many options in front of them for how to best achieve further growth, many options of which will be on Ethereum.  EVM compatibility makes switching or spanning chains relatively cheap. What matters to this growth dapp projects in their next phase of maturity is composability, integration, and liquidity, not speed or cheapness of transactions.\nAt the extremes you see a version of this today, Axie has built Ronin for scalability, Tether is on Omni, ETH and Tron…\n\nThe only thing that will keep your faster/cheaper EVM compatible chain relevant is a differentiated use case that is valuable for your dapp projects in their needs. Now let’s talk about some developer dynamics.\n\n# Developer incentives\n\nA rational dev will always take the shortest path, time and resource wise, to achieve an approximate end goal that close their vision. This lets you get your product out and test for product market fit. There are so many new things in crypto, spending more time on an unreleased project has huge opportunity costs. This is the case for any startup but even worse for a crypto one during a bull market. So why build fundamental building blocks when you can leverage off 3rd party works? It worked well for Linux and open source adoption in a Microsoft world and it worked for Node adoption in the web2 world. To put it bluntly you will be able to ship a more fully featured and integrated product on day one on ETH than anywhere else. There will be exceptions but this will be the majority case.\n\nThis is what happens when dapp projects are still small, let’s take a look at what happens when they’re bigger. Once you grow and have an audience, you will have more resources to allow you to better tailor to the audience that you don’t know A) if it exists or B) exactly what they want. Once you have an app with an established and growing audience you will be solely focused on features for your users or target users. A large subset of these features are already exists on Ethereum ecosystem either as financial primitives, integrations or partnering opportunities. So even if you got big somewhere else you will have to bridge or integrate with an ETH based project. This is the benefits of power law returns in the diversity of the ETH ecosystem. Finally Ethereum still has advantages in composability and security. The real measure of success for an Ethereum competitor in the long run is not in the projects that has deployed on it, it is what those projects do when they scale up and how the project spreads its value across chains. You see it today the big DeFi projects are going multi-chain for various reasons, scalability being a major one, but the value accrues back to ETH from a primary chain perspective.\n\nA final point related to the existing ecosystem, it took years for Ethereum to build that up and you’re only seeing the stability and maturity now for a thriving ecosystem. Can this be bootstrapped by copy pasta dapps? Additionally before that it took years for Ethereum to build the tooling to make the above possible do these exist for competitors?\n\n# User incentives\n\nI see a world where users do not understand what is behind the product but trust it empirically. I first came across this idea from @AriDavidPaul. You trust your credit card, very few people know the technical details and tradeoffs of the infrastructure that powers cards, nor do they care. More importantly the merchants that sells trust it too.\n\nUsers are already fickle, just look at AMMs they go where the liquidity /price is and look at all the mercenary capital in Yield aggregators. Yes token incentives creates greater buy-in, governance and participation in projects but this mainly accrues to the project no the underlying chain.\n\nLet’s look at this from another perspective, a value chain perspective. You have: \n\n* Users -> dapps -> blockchains \n* Demand -> gateway -> suppliers \n\nI used gateway because not all projects have aggregator characteristics. The dapp projects (gateway) are closest to the users effectively control the demand and power in this value chain and they will inevitably try to modularise the suppliers. Look at what Apple did to IOS app and games developers (suppliers) and Amazon did to sellers. @benthompson writes in depth about this stuff, give him a sub!\n\n# Left overs and conclusion\n\nHow does Solana, Polkadot and Cosmos fit in here? I suspect they’re more defensible given they’re not as reliant on speed and cheap transactions. This is an area I’m still diving into and may write more on.\n\nWhat timeframe am I talking about 2-5 years.\n\nThis piece is not focused around price potential of the the projects mentioned below a lot of these chains can be quite successful and still be an acquisition channel for ETH, but acquisition channels never overtake the thing it is acquiring for.  EVM while a great growth hack is one that can only be used as a stepping stone, day one you need to have a meaningful differentiation.\n\nWhere am I wrong? What am I missing? What should I expand on?\nLet me know as I write to improve my thinking.", "timestamp": 1633743130, "digest": "TowfUO_UqLQhuD603ahHF921Kx2romAjlwfdKoyniKw", "contributor": "0x2a41D6d9f24F4a1458F1072e83f40736f43eF16c"}

I’ve been thinking quite a lot about our future as a society — Says the Marketer — things used to be hard enough when we had to worry about manipulating people’s base instincts and having to negotiate our own humanity versus what we do for a living. But now the kind of information we get about our consumers goes well beyond manipulation, we took out the guesswork and found out that the vast majority of people can be told what to believe and what to do at the click of a button. Don’t you get it? We managed to crack the code to human behaviour with machines, and it turns out there wasn’t much there to begin with.\n>\n> \\- So no toast then? — Replies the Bartender, clearly uncomfortable\n>\n> \\- Here’s to the risk-takers\n>\n> The marketer gulps down his drink, and leaves without paying the bill.\n\nAt what point did it become so crucial to have a brand and a roadmap, not only as a medium for commerce and industry, but as individuals as well? When did people start caring so much about the way they were presenting themselves to the world through the digital sphere?\n\nAs many documentaries, scientific papers and medium articles have explored, the average web user may have a handle on how to create a voice through social media, search engines and the like; but they don’t have enough of an education on how to leverage the digital powers-that-be in their benefit as a human being.\n\nThe digital age has divided us, immersed us on an endless cycle of instant gratification and short attention spans. We are a part of the internet’s infancy, an as such, we must set the standards with which we’re moving forward towards a more mature and informed way of using the tools at our disposal.\n\nEvery algorithm has its core mandates, vilified and obscured as the may be, and they’re not so hard to figure out. It all comes down to three main concepts, that I believe could lead us towards a more disciplined and equitable usage of the web.\n\n**These three concepts can be summarized by the following attitudes towards technology and data, or virtues if you'd like:**\n\n## Transparency\n\nWe've been using social media wrong, the core concept behind building an audience should be community first and monetization second. As platforms like Instagram, Facebook and Twitter become more and more like online marketplaces, the individual users have started acting more like brands, instead of the other way around.\n\nThe only and truest form of escaping the cycle of vanity and greed that surrounds the present social media landscape while still offering an opportunity for financial growth for creators is to understand that we've been seeing the whole approach upside-down, and to shift our focus into **genuine, selfless, connection.**\n\n## Knowledge\n\nIgnorance nowadays can be more costly than you'd ever imagine. Not understanding how tech companies monetize you, how their algorithms learn to manipulate you through the data you voluntarily hand them on a silver platter, is an omission we as a society should not tolerate any longer.\n\nNot to sound too pessimistic, all it takes is for the average person to understand the psychological nudges you're being subjected to, how to use the algos to your advantage to further your education, and how to harness the near infinite power of using the web responsibly, to turn this problem back at their creators and empower the individual through their data.\n\n## Art\n\nWhat is art, really? It isn't craftsmanship, that debate has been settled for close to a century now; it isn't symbolism or a message either, you could argue that some of the greatest masterpieces in history have no message or intention to speak of.\n\nThe way I see it, Art (with a capital A) is humanity's story being told through expression. And from there, we can surmise where the economy of the future can lead us after every industry task has been automated, when people no longer need jobs.\n\nI'm not one to propose any single technology as a solution, no one can predict where the world will lead us, but the NFT and Web3 boom we’re living right now shows us what could happen in a world where every piece of human expression can be verified, tracked and monetized somewhat democratically.\n\n**The specifics may be still inconclusive, but the core principle is there. The true way of furthering our future as a species is by retaking what made us human in the first place. Not labor, not tools, but art; I dream of a world where the creative economy leads society, and where every voice is heard by, sometimes niche, communities.**", "timestamp": 1633743844, "digest": "4CLbJh6CSDJYPA2ywjE0yQSWmhw_RI7ranwez85kKWs", "contributor": "0x0BB602F88BF886282fF69d4Cec937cc2A7d9E19A"}

I’ve been thinking quite a lot about our future as a society — Says the Marketer — things used to be hard enough when we had to worry about manipulating people’s base instincts and having to negotiate our own humanity versus what we do for a living. But now the kind of information we get about our consumers goes well beyond manipulation, we took out the guesswork and found out that the vast majority of people can be told what to believe and what to do at the click of a button. Don’t you get it? We managed to crack the code to human behaviour with machines, and it turns out there wasn’t much there to begin with.\n>\n> \\- So no toast then? — Replies the Bartender, clearly uncomfortable\n>\n> \\- Here’s to the risk-takers\n>\n> The marketer gulps down his drink, and leaves without paying the bill.\n\nAt what point did it become so crucial to have a brand and a roadmap, not only as a medium for commerce and industry, but as individuals as well? When did people start caring so much about the way they were presenting themselves to the world through the digital sphere?\n\nAs many documentaries, scientific papers and medium articles have explored, the average web user may have a handle on how to create a voice through social media, search engines and the like; but they don’t have enough of an education on how to leverage the digital powers-that-be in their benefit as a human being.\n\nThe digital age has divided us, immersed us on an endless cycle of instant gratification and short attention spans. We are a part of the internet’s infancy, an as such, we must set the standards with which we’re moving forward towards a more mature and informed way of using the tools at our disposal.\n\nEvery algorithm has its core mandates, vilified and obscured as the may be, and they’re not so hard to figure out. It all comes down to three main concepts, that I believe could lead us towards a more disciplined and equitable usage of the web.\n\n**These three concepts can be summarized by the following attitudes towards technology and data, or virtues if you'd like:**\n\n## Transparency\n\nWe've been using social media wrong, the core concept behind building an audience should be community first and monetization second. As platforms like Instagram, Facebook and Twitter become more and more like online marketplaces, the individual users have started acting more like brands, instead of the other way around.\n\nThe only and truest form of escaping the cycle of vanity and greed that surrounds the present social media landscape while still offering an opportunity for financial growth for creators is to understand that we've been seeing the whole approach upside-down, and to shift our focus into **genuine, selfless, connection.**\n\n## Knowledge\n\nIgnorance nowadays can be more costly than you'd ever imagine. Not understanding how tech companies monetize you, how their algorithms learn to manipulate you through the data you voluntarily hand them on a silver platter, is an omission we as a society should not tolerate any longer.\n\nNot to sound too pessimistic, all it takes is for the average person to understand the psychological nudges you're being subjected to, how to use the algos to your advantage to further your education, and how to harness the near infinite power of using the web responsibly, to turn this problem back at their creators and empower the individual through their data.\n\n## Art\n\nWhat is art, really? It isn't craftsmanship, that debate has been settled for close to a century now; it isn't symbolism or a message either, you could argue that some of the greatest masterpieces in history have no message or intention to speak of.\n\nThe way I see it, Art (with a capital A) is humanity's story being told through expression. And from there, we can surmise where the economy of the future can lead us after every industry task has been automated, when people no longer need jobs.\n\nI'm not one to propose any single technology as a solution, no one can predict where the world will lead us, but the NFT and Web3 boom we’re living right now shows us what could happen in a world where every piece of human expression can be verified, tracked and monetized somewhat democratically.\n\n**The specifics may be still inconclusive, but the core principle is there. The true way of furthering our future as a species is by retaking what made us human in the first place. Not labor, not tools, but art; I dream of a world where the creative economy leads society, and where every voice is heard by, sometimes niche, communities.**", "timestamp": 1633745124, "digest": "4CLbJh6CSDJYPA2ywjE0yQSWmhw_RI7ranwez85kKWs", "contributor": "0x0BB602F88BF886282fF69d4Cec937cc2A7d9E19A"}

"帰国して数日たちましたが、異常に眠る日と眠れない日を繰り返す日々です。12時間寝て3時間寝て....。\n\nまあそれはさておき、[@Sho-T](https://steemit.com/@Sho-T)氏に声掛けしてもらい登壇することになりました。帰国後は資料まとめに大忙し。この後に、少しプラハの記事なども書きたいなと思ってます。\n\nではでは。本題に入る前に少し自分ごとを。\n\n私が暗号通貨、いやBitcoinに興味を持ったのは自由な社会の実現。過剰な自由への介入を好まなかったことに始まります。そんな僕なので技術もさることながら実現する世界観が好きでした。DEVCON4の技術的な解説は各所でされているのであえてここで発表することもありませんし、非エンジニアとしてそこに正確な情報を提供できるわけでもありませんのでビジョンに注目しました。\n\nそして、情報はすぐにアップデートし今は瞬時にして陳腐化します。\n\n『諸行無常、諸法無我』\n\n何が大切か。\n\n『意志です』\n\nベクトルとでもいいましょうか？選択でしょうか？人によって表現は違うかもしれません。\n\nなのでEthereumを含めてブロックチェーン、スマートコントラクトプラットフォームの向かおうとしている未来を読み取りたいと思って挑みました。\n\nと、前置きはここまでにして本題に入ります。\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmfAgNwcyTb6mRspjC3s3uxbxk5bP1tRbk1KRKaHPeaS57/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%202018-11-18%2013.09.21.png)\n\nプラハ市街が見渡せる会場。俯瞰するにはとても良い環境。\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmcM1m3ze3UrHEWZiAGPwDUVcNhLM5eMMA1dApZuUXUJxf/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%202018-11-18%2013.09.37.png)\n\n参加人数は昨年のおよそ倍と聞いてます。チケットも即完売で制限がなければどのくらいの人が集まったことでしょうか？日本人はおよそ25名ほど。エンジニア以外にもっと参加した方が良いと思います。講演数は180。とても網羅などできるわけでもなく、私は32に絞りました。しかし、満員御礼で見れないものも。会場周辺でも多くのミートアップが開催されEthereum以外のプロジェクトが多数集まり活発な議論があったように思われます。\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmVS2Xe2LPQAWERUct66a2X2fupoRHqdiVFCnCkVrMSJth/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%202018-11-18%2013.09.52.png)\n\n会場内は常時食事と飲み物が用意されていました。メディテーションルームで時折瞑想してリフレッシュするなどとても充実してました。\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmUmJQGNPieDANHe92wjpMrbRGVoo5VisdkAR1MEzppLWv/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%202018-11-18%2013.10.02.png)\n\nBinance

Dappブラウザ）で実装されるとの事でした。\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmVyX9qM5Q3YcZK7shZHFtFXa1PpWRfTSS6by8Eg5qccGC/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%202018-11-18%2013.10.58.png)\n\n僕的にはここがすごくドキッ！としました。今はWalletがブロックチェーンの入り口として目立ちますが、この先はログイン機能がキーになると思いました。EOA（外部アカウント）ではなくスマートコントラクトでアカウントを作ってしまう発想に開発の柔軟さを感じました。彼ら（Gnosis）はFirst Class Citizenと言っていました。これができることで、アカウントのリカバリーや秘密鍵の管理、GASの隠蔽、ログインなどに使える様になるそうです。\n\nここから先は私の憶測ですが、コントラクトアカウントがメッセージを受け取り自動的にアクションを起こすことができる様になるのではないかと興奮しています。今のインタラクティブなWEBと同じ様なことができるようになる訳です。ブロックチェーンの難点はとにかく秘密鍵署名が全てのアクションの始まりですからね。コントラクトアカウントは可能性の塊なのではないかと思いました。汎用プラットフォームの強さを感じます。\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmafGxSSsnrqMKVKH3JxqmxsKRHLrmuGPFaBEjvAXXeqge/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%202018-11-18%2013.11.12.png)\n\n次はスケーリングです。Sidechain,Statechannel,Plasma,Raiden Networkなどなどオフチェーンのソリューションはいくつも提案されていますが実装が遅れいます。メインチェーンのセキュリティを維持することに苦労しているようです。そこでTEEを使った演算のアウトソーシングが提案されています。CPUにあるセキュア領域を使っ仕組みです。Touch IDでお馴染みの技術です。Trezorなどのハードウェアウォレットを想像していただいてもいいかもしれません。\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmVpjjhkUCQF8VntGH1HxHAEJn6rhnsbxzLLtJrrpkX9K1/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%202018-11-18%2013.11.22.png)\n\nネットワークの効率化も急務です。いかにトランザクションを効率的に投げるか。これもLibp2pとゆうP2P通信のフレームワークに移行していくようです。交通ルールの変更をして効率的なモビリティを実現するような感じです。Serenity（Ethereum2.0）もこのルールに移行します。ネットワーク構成の複雑化に合わせているのではないかと思っています。分散ストレージ（IPFS、Filecoin）も同じ仕組みで動いています。\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmV8ddVpxRzxVtaL7e654QF9HrYYScvDN4V7Fs26zHuK61/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%202018-11-18%2013.11.32.png)\n\nそして、コピー出来ないインターネットの基本は管理主体を持たないこと。分散化は必要条件でしょう（分散化とルールを縛れればブロックチェーンは不要にも思えますがね。。）。図を見るとわかりますが、WEB3.0は巨人がやっていることの一部を分散させる行為です。責任を持ったノードがある程度の規模に増えていかなければ実現できません。Srenity(Ethereum2.0）はそれを実現しようとしてるのではないでしょうか。。\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmW7Tw77iayuuszZxgJbU6LTeYPNRTWDB1huriSjuGMZjG/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%202018-11-18%2013.11.43.png)\n\nSrenityのロードマップです。チンタラしているようにも見えますが、今まで築いたネットワークを壊さずに丁寧に移行していく様子が見て取れます。\n\n先ず、承認者達をまとめるBeacon chainとETHと承認者を管理する既存のPoWチェーンのハイブリッドです。PoWチェーンを切り離しをし易くします。次はネットワークを分割しデータのみを転送するShard chain。これはネットワークに負荷をかけて次のステージへのストレッチです。メッセンジャーアプリあたりに使ってみたらいいのではないかと思ってます。次、eWASMが完成して計算力の向上がなされるとShard chainの下にVMレイヤーを作ってトランザクションも処理されるようになります。この段階でWalletはブラウザにネイティブサポートされる話も出てきそうですね。なのでログインとゆう概念はとても重要かなと思ってます。そして最後に、CBC Casperといった展開が提案さえています（コンセンサスにDAGの概念を取り入れているようで、shardの再編成の解説などはとても興味深いところでした。Infinit scaleとか...w)。\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmfBeSWziSUwEdVKcUHhyNorS81X7cpstgD6AovXCANW6W/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%202018-11-18%2013.11.54.png)\n\n### 結論、分散インターネットはTo The Moon!!!!\n\nEthereumだけでなく多くのプロジェクトで協力し合い新しいインターネットを完成させよう！各ネットワークが多段のオーバーレイネットワークを構成することで、ノードが安定的に運営されていく未来ができれば分散インターネットも夢ではありません。そうすれば、コピーできないインターネットが出来上がります。すなわち『価値のインターネット』の完成です。\n\n参考リンク\\\nTEE\\\n[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/devcon4/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/devcon4/

以外的加密资产时，他们需要一个过程来评估相关加密网络，并确定哪个具有最大的优势。\n我认为底层公链今年的表现将优于所有其他山寨币，原因之一，是因为它们是押注智能合约系统去中心化未来的最简单途径之一。所有去中心化应用（DApp）将在这些底层区块链网络之上运行，相比于押注这些底层网络，大海捞针地去筛选单独的借贷协议或去中心化交易所（DEX）则要困难得多。你可能会认为，这些网络的整体未来预期价值远高于比特币（BTC）的未来预期，BTC 主要用作价值储存。从技术分析角度，在我看来，与 ETH/BTC 货币对的多年区间实现突破，且形成与其一致的圆顶走势图，是今年的最主要趋势，市场正在显示未来的走向。这是迄今为止唯一一个 BTC 没有创下历史峰值的周期。由于 ETH 在过去一年的表现优于 BTC，其他 L1 网络，例如 Solana、Avalanche、Terra （Luna）、Fantom 和 Harmony 的表现也大大优于以太坊。这些网络较新，经历较少的实战测试，但它们目前都以更快、更便宜的智能合约平台的角色运行，这些平台从对冲基金和其他押注未来成功的机构及投资人手中获得了大量资金。FTX 创始人 SBF 身为 Solana 的顾问，领导了这股潮流。由于他之前与传统金融圈子的密切联系，以及身为 FTX / Alameda Research 首席执行官的巨大影响力，让他的名字在影响高净值个人 + 传统基金方面举足轻重。大多数传统金融公司在 2017 年时对加密货币普遍持有的负面看法，而当前的情况截然不同，仅 PYTH 的合作伙伴名单就清楚表明，公众舆论已经发生了惊人的转变。传统金融机构（tradFi）进入加密货币的最引人瞩目例子之一是 Jump Capital， 后者最近成立了自己的独立加密基金部门，他们甚至表示，他们一直积极参与 PYTH 以及其他区块链（如 LUNA）的治理。很可能还有很多其他类似于 Jump Capital 的基金，要么在等待合适的机会参与其中，要么在幕后悄悄地撸起袖子干活。每个 L1 公链都有自己的早期投资者和强大的创始人，他们致力于构建自己的生态系统：AVAX 有 Emin + 3AC、Terra Luna 有 Do Kwon + Novo。我认为，我们将在未来几年继续看到新的资本和新的能力超强的开发者进军加密领域，而随着美元资本和人才库的增长，我们将看到一个由不同智能合约平台组成的、蓬勃发展的生态系统，用户将能够选择从中自由选择。\n考虑到这一点，我认为基础货币应该是 ETH，交易应该专注于跑赢 ETH。如果你在链上做任何事情（这应该构成你交易的主要部分）， 需要以 ETH 作为参照起点。在购买 NFT、替代币、「桥」资产时，你应该确保业绩跑赢持有 ETH。将 2021 年的山寨币领域与 2017 年的山寨币领域进行比较，在我看来没有多大意义，因为当时的价值与现在相比微乎其微。以前你需要 BTC 才能在任何交易所购买任何替代币，而我们当时唯一使用的 DEX 是 etherdelta。现在的山寨币生态系统比 4-5 年前复杂得多，这就是为什么 ALT/ETH 图表在我看来比 ALT/BTC 更重要的原因。\n我个人认为，BTC 现在是我投资组合中最主要的避险资产，因为我认为，随着其规模的增长，以及其市值越来越接近黄金之类的东西，其波动性将继续呈下降趋势。同时，目前参与投资 BTC 的机构试图长期累积 BTC，我们会迎来一个缓慢的上涨，而不是像 2017 年那样的抛物线，这符合机构的最佳利益。每当散户衍生品交易者遭遇爆仓狂潮时，我们将继续看到 BTC 的市场回调。ETH 和其他币种，我仍然认为是一种交易，而当我想降低风险并从多头获利时，持有 BTC 可以是我的投资组合中这一部分的最佳选择。BTC 也非常适合用于衡量整个市场的回调程度，因为它是最容易用作对冲资产的加密资产，而且每当 BTC 遭到抛售，大量山寨币的抛售狂潮则更为凶猛。BTC 作为硬通货没有任何竞争对手，因此 BTC 一直会随着加密资产的增长而继续增长，即使它在创新方面并没有领先其它加密货币。你应该始终将 BTC 堆栈与从未接触过的活跃交易堆栈隔离开来，可以根据个人的风险喜好程度累积自己最喜欢的 L1 货币而进行交易。这些资产风险较大，因为前几年曾涌现出很多以太坊的竞争对手，而现在相比四年前的影响力已经严重式微，例如，波场 /DRGN/EOS。由于 FTX / SBF / Alameda 的持久影响力，我个人认为 Solana 是 仅次于 ETH 的最佳选择，但我认为这是主观想法而已。对山寨币的主要关注点应该是审视其 ALT/ETH 币对走势，当在每个 L1 生态系统中交易山寨币时，您应该仔细研究那些 ALT/L1 图表。例如，Solana 生态系统中的很多 SPL 代币全年业绩表现都不及 SOL。\n在接下来的一个季度中，我预计这一趋势将延续下去，因为这些 L1 智能合约平台在用户和网络锁定资金量方面会缩小与以太坊之间的差距。目前，这类 L1 中的市场领头羊（SOL / AVAX / LUNA / FTM / ONE）相比 7 月的低点上涨了 5-10 倍，而 ETH 的市场表现落于下风。就短期而言，我认为 SOL 涨得有点过凶，而 LUNA 最近在今年早些时候以来的历史最高点范围附近波动。预期 Solana 将在这一区间形成新的盘整波段，而其他币种则开始启动新的趋势。如果我们确实迎来 L1 山寨币一段时间的横向盘整，且 ETH 跑赢大盘，我预计 L1 山寨币网络上的开发者活动 / 用户活动 / 总锁仓（TVL）将继续呈上升趋势。如果这种情况因任何原因戛然而止，我个人会重新评估关于这些币种中长期表现会更出色的论点。在现有的 L1 中，Terra Luna 和 ONE 在短期内可能会有最强的上涨，而 AVAX 是基于以太坊虚拟机（EVM）的最强以太坊竞争对手。\n关于标杆币种比特币和以太坊的展望\n我对下个季度的 BTC 和 ETH 走势都持看涨态度，两者在夏季的大部分时间都从 6 月的低点反弹，在第三季度的 7 月向上突破。在过去的一个月里，我们看到了自 6 月下旬以来一波涨势以来的首次大幅回调，预计我们将在近期形成一个在宏观上较高的低点，然后在年底前推高至新高。\n随着 ETF 的批准，BTC 有潜在的催化剂，但其价值主张此时已经得到了各种类型的机构参与者的验证，我认为近期的价格影响不会像 2017 年那样巨大。我个人认为，鉴于中国出台的政策、对 BTC 挖矿 / 交易活动的打击，以及当时处于价格峰值的恐惧，这些基本面事件导致大量抛售和资金外流，我们在夏季本来有可能守不住 3 万美元的低点。BTC 挖矿活动在地域分布上的调整，从长期看应该是利好，因为这一活动更趋于去中心化，分散到不受监管限制的地域。如果我们看到更多类似于萨尔瓦多的政策决定，这可能会是一个主要的看涨催化剂。从技术分析来看，BTC 价格会守住\\~3.8 万-4 万美元区域，抢先突破区间高点，\\~4.07 万美元是夏季三个月区间的最高日收盘价。我认为低点已经到位，但如果本季度开始时下潜至 3.6 万-3.7 万美元，我不会感到惊讶。只要我们的周线收盘价不低于区间高点\\~4.2 万-4.3 万美元，我就笃定接下来的几个月里会继续上涨，并刷新历史高点纪录。\n以太坊已经实施了 EIP-1559 提案升级，其下一个主要催化剂，即主网与信标链的合并和转向权益证明（PoS）共识机制的计划要推迟到 2022 年第二季度，但越来越清楚的是，ETH 是互联网的主要货币。你需要 ETH 来购买 NFT、在 DEX 上进行交易、使用所有借贷协议进行存款等。虽然以太坊面临来自其他 L1 的竞争，但我们看到的是，加密货币整体用户群体不断壮大，而不是 ETH 用户离开以太坊转投其它 L1。高 Gas 费用的瓶颈是散户拥抱以太坊的重大障碍，但 L2 解决方案的发展正在迅速解决这个问题。即使没有这些 L2 解决方案，很多 ETH 长期用户目前也已身家万贯，Gas 费用对他们而言不过是毛毛雨。从投资的角度来看，其他 L1 确实有更大的上涨空间，但因为它们的盘子更小，而且经过的实战测试较少，因此要获得更多回报，就需要承担更多风险，但以太坊绝对不会很快消失。我在中长期看好 ETH/BTC，因为我认为智能合约平台的天花板高过 BTC 作为价值存储的上限。我每天都在使用 ETH，而我个人很少使用 BTC。\n以太坊生态的 DeFi 展望\n自 3 月初 ETH 再次冲击自 2017 年以来的历史新高之后，所有主要的 DeFi 蓝筹代币与 ETH 的比价都一直在持续下跌。市场已经明确表态，这些网络的估值并不代表它们当前的使用情况，相比之下，DeFi 的底层网络价值（ETH）被低估了。很多 ETH-DeFi 替代币和其他拖后腿的币种未能创下历史新高，甚至未能突破 6 月份以来的高点。去年我们迎来了第一个「DeFi 之夏」，那时 AAVE、COMP、Uniswap 等平台人气真正爆棚。 当时 DeFi 相关代币是市场上最新的山寨币，这就是它们的表现如此优异的主要原因。以太坊之外的其他智能合约平台上当时不存在 DeFi，而现在，多个不同的链上都拥有了 DeFi，并且很多情况下这些 L1 上具有 EVM 兼容性，这可能会是扭转这些 DeFi 资产相对 ETH 下跌趋势的价值叙事，因为随着新资本进入 DeFi 领域，它们的使用量可能会增加。这些代币对 ETH 的比值目前已回到年初以来的低点附近。除了 DeFi 蓝筹股之外，DeFi 中还有很多新的创新完全来自全新的协议，例如 OHM / SPELL。 我认为 ETH-DeFi 的最大优势在于这些机会，然后是去中心化衍生品领域。由于一些正在严厉打击加密交易，而且许多其他非 KYC 的交易所正在降低其提款限额或强制使用 KYC，我们将看到用户从中心化交易所（CEX）流向链上交易。 dYdX 已经展示出这种趋势的出现，去中心化的永续合约交易量可与某些具有良好流动性的 CEX 相媲美。DPX 是另一种去中心化替代方案，致力于构建期权平台。在 Solana 上现在有了 Mango Markets 和 PsyOptions 等平台。在接下来的几个月以及 2022 年，所有这些平台的用户增长都应该会加快。\nDeFi 代币一直以来很好地扮演了对其他多头 / 现货头寸的对冲，但随着我们进入这个新的多链阶段（EVM DApp 可以跨区块链部署），这种趋势可能很快就会宣告结束。 正如我之前所说，我认为趋势将会是：新的机构资本进入加密领域，押注 DeFi + 智能合约的长期成功，在可用选项中，最佳循环投注标的是替代性 L1 的代币，其市值相比 ETH 要小得多，且目前性能优于以太坊，只是不那么安全。\n对于对冲选项，现在最好寻找没有那么多资本进入的较弱的 L1 + 较小的社区，而不是 ETH-DeFi 资产。随着替代性 L1 捕捉到新加密货币进局者的市场份额，并逐渐蚕食 ETH 的市场主导地位，我认为这将继续是最好的交易。\n如果投资 ETH-DeFi 代币，我认为最好关注较新的协议（能为以前不存在的用户提供价值） + 关注当前的市场趋势，现在 EVM 的当红趋势是多链 /「桥」项目和去中心化衍生品，而不要去盲目购买所谓的 DeFi 「蓝筹股」。\nNFT 市场展望\n在我看来，NFT 是最有意思的细分市场，因为它们吸引了完全没有加密背景人群的极大兴趣，让加密社区之外的人们加入可爱的数字图片 + 链游，比解释 P2P 借贷和金融系统更新迭代的优势要容易得多。我在这里看到了四个主要趋势：具有历史价值的链上和生成艺术、头像 NFT 社区 + 公司进入该领域、销售个人作品的传统艺术家和摄影师，以及链游。\n单纯从历史角度看，加密原住民对最早和最有影响力的链上作品（例如 Punks / ArtBlocks ）给予高价值，是去年年底其他人对 NFT 产生浓厚兴趣的跳板。由于以太坊是第一个智能合约平台，因此从溯源和早期社区的角度来看，随着加密领域的发展壮大，其网络上的第一批 NFT 将会保持很高的价值。我很想知道这种趋势是否也适用于其他替代性 L1 公链，这些公链刚刚都在自己的平台上推出了第一批 NFT。Solana、Fantom、AVAX、Harmony 和其他项目现在都有一些 NFT 项目和相关的 NFT 市场。一直使用这些平台作为自己首选生态系统的早期用户，可能会像以太坊一族对 Punks 等项目的青睐一样，认为这些平台上的项目颇具价值。看一下生成艺术类别中，很明显，即使铸造成本增加，Art Blocks 仍然是占主导地位的平台。 之后还会诞生像 Fidenza 这样广受欢迎的作品，尤其是随着时间推移，生成艺术家的数量会越来越多。\n可能最具人气的趋势是以散户为中心的头像 NFT 项目。我们已经看到了像无聊猿游艇俱乐部（Bored Ape Yacht Club，BAYC）这样的项目大获成功，看到它如何吸引了很多体坛巨星、以及其他和加密货币毫不搭界人士的密切关注。我们还看到，很多传统企业试图利用 NFT 进行自己的营销。随着越来越多的公司最终看到了构建线上社区的价值，Visa 购买一个 Punk，以及虚拟宠物游戏站 Neopets 在 Solana 上推出经典角色集合等事件，只是这一趋势的开始。在我看来，NFT 收藏是迄今为止引导用户社区的最佳方式，因为它比起传统营销方式中向人们发送电子邮件列表或让人们购买商品而言，具体的参与感要强烈地多。当您构建一个所有人都持有 NFT 的社区时，向这些人分配价值要容易得多，而且他们也会对社区有更多的资金投入。我们已经看到了不断有项目分别推出自己的 10,000 套 NFT，而公司将在如何使用 NFT 进行营销方面变得更有创意。不过，这一趋势的主要障碍是让新用户获得加密钱包，这是一个很容易解决的用户体验问题。在即将到来的这个季度，我认为领先的头像图片（PFP）项目，比如 Punks / BAYC / Cool Cats / SMBs，和其他项目会继续有出色表现，但最有价值的可能是从中间梯队项目找到蒙尘的珍珠，其作品有机会能在市场的重新定价中获得更高的价格。我最看好 Creatures，因为我看好该项目创始人、21 岁的纽约艺术家 Danny Cole，以及他们迄今为止为为持币者的良好体验付出的巨大努力，似乎 Cole 对该项目规划的长期愿景只是他艺术作品进入数字世界的延伸。从视觉角度而言，0N1 Forces 仍然是我个人的最爱，从 Discord 频道来看，该团队也计划通过面对面的活动以及向持币者空投来建立社区。一般来说，这些 PFP 项目的代币表现实际上取决于这些项目如何为持币人创造价值，以及如何让社区参与。另一方面，在 NFT 领域中始终存在很多纯粹是为了抢钱的骗子项目，因为可以轻而易举地让人们铸造任何东西。请积极参与 Discord 和其他社交媒体的讨论，应该有助于你鉴别项目的质量，但最谨慎起见，最好在第一周左右不要轻举妄动，认真观察项目在市场上的发展情况。我真的很想看看这些元宇宙（Metaverse）世界是如何构建的，以及团队之间可能展开的合作，在这些方面做得很好并创造出凝聚力体验的项目将抢占巨大的优势。目前我只看到规划路线图，但在接下来的一年左右时间里，我们应该看看哪些项目能够在这一领域创造价值。\n链游结合了 NFT 和边玩边赚（Play-2-Earn）生态系统，也吸引了很多新用户进入加密社区。第一个成功重现 Roblox （世界最大的多人在线创作游戏）或 堡垒之夜（Fortnite）等游戏平台神话、同时还整合了一个允许用户边玩边赚钱系统的团队，将是迄今为止最成功的加密 DApp 之一。随着游戏开发商进军这个领域，像 Solana 和 AVAX 这样允许进行很多廉价微交易和高吞吐量的平台，应该在这方面具备优势。各大基金正在为黑客松提供 9 位数的激励计划，以吸引开发者进行构建，这应该会加速高质量的软件开发工程师向加密领域的过渡。链游 Axie Infinity 在菲律宾取得了巨大成功，目前是该领域最赚钱的山寨币，它绝对是元宇宙趋势的市场领导者，应该密切关注该行业的趋势节点或并购整合动态。我认为，10 月会看到元宇宙生态系统代币会开始迅速重拾涨势，AXS 质押将是一个巨大的催化剂。Parallel NFT 纸牌游戏是这一领域的另一个领跑者，尽管他们的游戏还没有正式推出。他们的作品真正与艺术很好地组合在一起，到目前为止，他们在培养社区方面也做得很好，充分细分的系统非常有利于用户的参与和竞争。此外，他们的团队也吸引了著名的投资人，比如来自 Youtube 的 Chad Hurley 等等。其他可能的早期赢家包括 Star Atlas 和 Aurory 之类的游戏，但目前尚未明确游戏玩法，我们无法真正了解具体细节。 我有一份小盘项目清单，我需要对其进行更多研究，然后才能发表我的长期观点 （ILV / PYR / RAINI / YGG 和其他一些项目）。要想从这些游戏中获得最大价值，我认为您必须「在市场确信它们会成功之前」就早早入局投资，当人们还充满怀疑的时候，您会以最好的折扣买入其资产。\n传统艺术家推出自己的 NFT 项目，也是一个值得关注的重要趋势。我已经提到了 Danny Cole 的 Creatures，但还会有更多类似的项目。 通过纸质媒介销售艺术品，比销售 NFT 困难得多，因为后者中所有东西都可以通过数字方式轻松访问。我对这种趋势没有太多预测，因为我对传统艺术知之甚少，但我确实认为，逆潮流的噱头会随着时间而消失。当人们第一次看到他们不理解的东西时，这似乎是他们的下意识反应。\n值得关注的四季度投资组合配置\n10 月份我的核心头寸将是 LUNA，因为其 Columbus-5 网络升级将成为其币价起飞的催化剂，我还会押注元宇宙 / 游戏领域的领军者 Axie。L1 表现出色和 NFT 是今年的两个主要趋势，因此在其中分配的资金要高于其它领域。\n\n除此之外的资金主要投入 LP 收益耕种和一些特定的市场板块。BTC 和 ETH 将缓慢移动，因此主要是抢短差交易（Scalping）策略而不是持有长期波动性，直到我认为其他地方没有更高的 beta 回报才会投入。一旦 ETH 重新站上约 3600 美元，我认为它会很快创下历史新高。BTC 在它需要突破的 5.5 万-5.8 万美元箱体仍然面临很大阻力，所以我会在这一区间寻找即将改写箱体高点的机会入场。一旦突破 5.8 万美元这一点位，我担心 ALT/BTC 会表现不佳，并开始推动价格发现。\n\n从技术分析来看，LUNA 已经在自 3 月以来的历史高点上方盘整了约 40 天，从夏季低点的底部上涨了约 6 倍。一旦 Columbus-5 上线，并且生态系统中的所有其他项目都启动，我预计它会向上突破。\n\nAxie 处于类似的情况，并且在最初发力后已经盘整了两个月。在大约一周前的回调行情中，它重新测试了 7 月以来的高点，并强力反弹。\n\n我的 LP 收益耕种 / 单边赌注分布在多个链中，保持流动性是其中重要的原因之一，可以在最好的机会出现时迅速转移资金。最近的两个主要例子是 AVAX 上的 $TEDDY 和 Harmony 上的 $JEWEL，如果你已经关注这些生态系统，则更容易找到这样的机会。\n\n对于 BTC 和 ETH，底部的更强确认，将会在 4.5 万美元 / 3100 美元以上带来突破。\n对市场的总体看法：预计比特币和以太坊这样的标杆币种上涨趋势缓慢，具有强大基本面催化剂的山寨币的表现优于其他山寨币，而恐龙级山寨币和其他未能交付价值的山寨币则继续表现不佳。理想的轮换是在 10 月份将 LUNA / Axie 投入价格发现，之后转向标杆币种，然后在明年第一季度之前重新创建 Solana 头寸，作为主要持有资产。\n\n我对 NFT 的市场周期节点的认知，不如我对标杆币种和替代币那么了如指掌，所以只是持有我认为被低估的那些 NFT，直到市场对其它们重新定价。\n\n我还将继续密切关注以太坊的合并，因为届时将成为 ETH 跑赢其他 L1 的催化剂，可能会重演 ETH 在 2021 年 4 月至 5 月的一波行情。\n\n微观视角看项目价值\nL1 币种\nLUNA\n\nColumbus-5 网络升级： 9 月 29-30 日\n届时将实现与 IBC 和 Cosmos 生态系统中其他所有区块链的整合\n整合 Ozone Insurance\n整合 Wormhole ，在 Solana 和 Luna 之间建立「桥」\n所有用于铸造 $UST 的 LUNA 都将被销毁\n总体理论是 UST 将在多个链上得到更多使用，这对 LUNA 来说将带来通货紧缩，Columbus-5 升级后很多新项目将在 Terra LUNA 生态系统中推出，将吸引新用户，而通过使用 Terra 和虫洞桥，很容易将这些项目和用户连接起来。在我看来，该项目目前在西半球并不是那么受欢迎，因为它的主要社区在东半球，但在接下来的几个月里应该会发生变化。\nSOL\n\n目前不是我的主要持仓，因为我认为其他资产有更多的上涨空间，但我的个人整体交易指标是瞄准跑赢 Solana，因为它整年都是市场领跑者。我认为，一旦 Solana 完成了从最近的整合，这种强劲势头将会延续。可能在近期引爆涨势的催化剂是 EVM 的集成，以及当前黑客松的落幕。\nSolana NFT 的表现也非常好。SOL 最近的大部分涨势都发生在其创下历史高点之后，我认为这对于人们将收益回流给生态系统是件好事。Solana Monkey Business 目前绝对是这一市场中的领跑者，但还有很多其他项目不断在启动。对于大多数新的 Solana NFT 项目我并没有逐一跟踪，但认真关注 Twitter 上的发展态势以及市场上最流行的趋势，是确定哪些项目最有前途的好办法。\nSolana 上开发的链游的发展态势非常看好，这就是为什么我认为，Aurorians 会是最好的押注之一。\n从技术分析来看，在 BTC 守住阵地的同时，SOL 价格没有进一步回撤，会在 150 美元上方盘整巩固后再向上反弹。如果 SOL 持续向下，这将是一个很好的现货做多机会，但考虑到投资者对 SOL 的强烈关注，我们是否得到这一机会尚未可知。\n我认为 10 月左右会进行盘整，但需要一直关注 SOL，因为不想因为忽视而错过它的行情启动。\nAVAX\n\n自 8 月中旬以来，AVAX 币价和 AVAX 生态系统中微小盘项目的表现一直非常强劲。JOE 一直是顶尖表现选手，并且比当时的低点上涨了约 100 倍。随着与 AAVE 一起推出流动性挖矿计划，AVAX 和 JOE 应该会继续呈上升趋势，但我认为目前 LUNA 比 AVAX 有更多优势。在我看来，AVAX 目前绝对是 EVM DApp 的第一阵营区块链，因此用户可以简单易用、开发者可以轻松移植，是推动其币价上涨的一个非常强大因素。即使 Arbitrum 推出，我也不认为 AVAX 链上会有出现任何重大项目流失。zk rollup 是否会改变这种情况，非常值得观察一下，但是如果 ETH L2 解决方案与 AVAX 的用户体验没有显著不同，那么我认为 rollup 的登场不会造就 AVAX 的熊市。我持有一小部分 AVAX，期盼从新的生态发布中获利。\nTeddy Cash 是 AVAX 上新的贷款协议之一，在过去一周左右的时间里表现良好，我认为，该币种仍然没有进入大批投资者的视野，因为它的市值只有约 2500 万美元左右。该项目中用户可以使用 AVAX 作为借入其稳定币 TSD 的抵押品，并且目前还有一些 LP 收益耕种农场正在进行中。\nHarmony / $ONE\n\n与 AVAX / SOL / FTM 一样具备高性能和短时延，但知名度属于小且透明。具备功能跨链桥、可兼容 EVM，Harmony 所缺乏的只是社区开发和项目开发。这让我感觉 ONE 与 2 月初的 SOL 非常类似，当时 Solana 区块链的速度很快，但上面只有一个 DApp：Raydium。 几周前，Harmony 启动了一个 3 亿美元的生态系统基金，以刺激开发、鼓励建设者，所以希望很快就会看到更多的项目出现。 DeFi Kingdoms DEX 是我 9 月份收获最为丰厚的押注之一，其团队对外沟通了未来目标，并且一直在有效地发布更新。除了交换 / 收益耕种实用用例之外，它是我见过的唯一一个在为用户创建基准元宇宙世界方面做得很好的 DEX。我暂时不打算离开 Jewel / ONE 收益耕种农场，想观望一下他们如何开发游戏以及 NFT 如何与整个生态系统互动。\nLayer 0\nATOM\n\n如果 Cosmos 能够从使用 Cosmos SDK 构建的所有项目中收获到价值，那么从长远来看，Cosmos 资产的上涨潜力巨大。当前已经有大量出色的项目采用了他们的架构进行构建，而现在的重点是通过 IBC 将它们全部连接起来，以 Cosmos Hub 作为核心。持币者从 Atom 中收获的价值一直很少，直到最近才略有改观。现在，基于 Cosmos SDK 构建的区块链正通过 IBC 变得整合度更高，观察一下这将如何影响 Atom 币价会是件有意思的事情，或在治理中通过哪些提案来改变架构。Cosmos 提案 #56 提议将 Cosmos Hub 作为连接到 IBC 所有链的路由器，这应该会是未来几个月推动其币价上涨的主要催化剂。我在 Atom/Osmo LP 中有一部分头寸，并拥有一部分 Atom，但随着该提案接近通过，将寻求添加其他头寸。\n去中心化交易所\ndYdX\n\n非常简单的理论设计，吸引了从中心化交易所迁移的资金，属于当前最赚钱的衍生品 DEX；\nJOE\n\n已成为最好的自动做市商（AMM）之一 ，其市值将在短时间内逼近 UNI & SUSHI；\nOSMO\n\n更像小且人们不知道的项目，但身为 Cosmos 上的主要 AMM，其运行良好，随着人们对 IBC 的了解越来越多，应该会得到更多使用；\nNINJA\n\n微小盘， Solana DEX / NFT / 链游，如果团队执行得力，其市值天花板不可限量；\nDPX\n\n去中心化期权协议，目前处于测试网阶段，但我认为他们在这一板块中没有太多竞争力；\n鉴于其市值仍不过 1-2 亿美元，还是很好的循环投资标的\nAstroport \\[即将推出\\]\n\nColumbus-5 升级后将成为 LUNA 平台的主要 AMM，目前尚未推出。\n多链 / 桥项目\nSYN\n\n这一领域中用户目前正在不同链上追逐最佳机会，快速且易于使用的「桥」会是非常有用的利器；\nSynapse 是从 Arbitrum 快速取回资金的少数途径之一，并且它们也具有与其他链互动的功能 + 将进行更多构建；\nSCRT\n\nSecret Network 是我在主网上看到的第一个以隐私为主打卖点的智能合约协议。他们即将推出的 Supernova 协议更新将实现 IBC 整合，类似于 LUNA 的 Columbus-5 更新。其币价走势图接近其囤积低点范围，因此主力已经开始在这里建仓，应该会过一段时间人们才会开始谈论这一代币。\n该项目已经测试了「桥」从 ETH 兑换成 SCRT ，「桥」运行正常，但它们在桥接时不提供任何基础货币，因此您必须从某个地方获取它，之后才能取消隐藏您的资产。\nREN\n\n另一个「桥」 项目，原理等同于 SYN\n对冲 / 做空的项目\nDOGE\n\n一直是业绩表现最弱的标杆代币之一，散户关注的重心已从 meme 币转移到 NFT，其他链上的狗币中也可以看到这种衰落趋势。\nBNB\n\n其他 L1 的崛起，已经让很多人忘记了 BSC，BNB 仍然积极地 在 Pancake Swap / Bakery Swap 进行交易，但不像以前那样多，因为当时 BSC 是唯一廉价的以太坊替代链；\n我个人坚信，今年余下时间内，BNB 相对于 SOL / LUNA / AVAX 的颓势将继续延续。\nMATIC\n\n与做空 BNB 的理论类似，其他原因包括 Arbitrum 和其它即将登场的 ETH L2 解决方案发展如火如荼。\n收益耕种机会\nJEWEL / ONE\n\nHarmony 上的主力 DEX，目前尚未受到太多关注，他们也计划发行 NFT，以及打造使用 ONE 的链游；\n大部分回报锁定到明年 7 月，以抵消高 APR ；\n每个 epoch 的 APR 不断衰减，项目依然处于早期阶段；\n我个人见到的最具创造性的 DEX 之一，具备先发优势 + 与其他类似项目不同的体验。\nOSMO / ATOM\n\nOsmosis 是首批与 IBC 其余部分连接的链之一，Gravity DEX / mBridge 将能够在第四季度末将 IBC 连接到以太坊和其他生态系统；\nCosmos 上的第一个主要 AMM，很可能成为 Cosmos 生态系统中 Luna IBC 连接的主要受益者。\nNINJA / SOL\n\n我个人非常看好 Ninja 团队，因为他们打造了一个表现优异的 DEX，且正朝着打造 NFT 市场 + 整合链游而努力工作。\n其团队绝对拥有一整套发展路线图，但作为小盘资产，我认为其上涨潜力不俗 。\n在 Orca 和 Ninja 中获得双倍奖励，其资金池应该会继续持续约 365 天，且无需担心无常损失，因为代币对是 NINJA/SOL 而不是 NINJA/USDC。\n稳定币收益耕种农场\nRari Capital USDC Pool\n\n23% APR\n存入 $USDC ，依据其收益聚合策略而获取回报\nAnchor on Luna\n\n\\~20% APR\n存入 $UST\nOHM\n\n我了解到这个项目真的已经很晚了，但他们已经将大约 1.5 亿美元投入到其金库中，并拥有一个致力于长期发展的用户社区；\n由于其市值现在超过 10 亿美元，我认为对多数人（比如我）而言，很难忽视这一项目，其代币会在这一基础上继续加速上行；\n观察一下 Olympus Pro 推出后的运行情况会很有趣，但老实说，这个项目会飞得更高\n这一唯一的利空因素是：其市值相比金库总资产的溢价现在相当大 。\n单边质押\nxJewel\n\nDPX\n\nNFT\nPunks\n\n鉴于 ETH 表现良好，Punks 应该会继续上涨。您可能不会再因为购买这些 Punks 而获得 100 倍的收益，但它们本质上就像在以太坊上购买房地产一样；\n如果此时购买这些 Punks，我个人认为，您应该计划多年持有。\nBAYC\n\n很明显是 NFT 板块中仅次于 Punks、排名第二的项目，从投资回报率的角度来看有点类似，您如果甘冒较大风险挖掘中间梯队项目，可能会获得更多收益，但 BAYC 将保持价值，这是毫无置疑的。\nSMB\n\nSolana 上人气最高的 NFT，我认为其定价最终将接近于 BYAC；\n我认为，在当前价格基础上，在短期内涨势会放缓一点，因为其地板价刚刚从 50 → 250 SOL，但从整个 NFT 格局来看，它是最可靠的选择；\n作为 Solana 上主要的 PFP NFT，相比以太坊上同类项目而言其价格被低估。\nCreatures\n\n拥有强大的社区，并与现实生活中的艺术家建立了出色的人脉关系；\n持币者人数与代币总数之比 \\~55% + 「大鲨鱼」奥尼尔等名人加入社区；\n相对于其他相同质量项目 \\~3 ETH 左右的地板价，其价格仍然相对便宜；\n我个人持有其中一些稀有品，真的不打算很快出售，认为这些是目前 PFP 项目中上涨潜力最大的项目。\nLoomlock NFT\n\nLoom 的生态项目；\n预期该项目会具有持久力，并且除了 JPG 之外还有更多的东西转化为 NFT，我认为，Loom 在培养社区和增加价值方面会做得很好；\n我通过铸造得到了一些 Loomlock NFT， 可能会在二级市场购买更多。\n0N1 Forces\n\n这是我个人从美学上最钟爱的 NFT 项目，其中几张头像我可能会长期保留一段时间；\n我对交易 0N1 Forces NFT 不是很感兴趣，但在我的 PFP 之外还有该项目一些其他的 NFT，如果他们的盘子变得很大，我可能会转入其他较小的项目；\n10 月第一周在洛杉矶为 0N1 持币者举行首次线下面对面聚会；\n其作品在第四季度会有空投。\nFTM 上的 Bit Umans / Ancestral Umans / Portalheads\n\n对 Fantom 上发布的首批 NFT 之一进行廉价赌注，对这些项目的信念并不高，但考虑到那里没有太多竞争，认为投资回报率是不错的。\nAVAX 上的 Crypto Seals\n\n在人们刚开始聚集时，我铸造了一些此类 NFT，与 FTM 上的操作理念相同，这是 AVAX 上最早的生成项目之一，并且几乎没有任何铸造成本。\nHarmony 上的 Gen 0 Heroes\n\n这些将与 DeFi Kingdoms DEX 一起发布，希望在它们出现时铸造一些，因为它们还可以让您更早地解锁收益耕种奖励，并且将成为 Harmony 上第一个值得注意的 NFT。\nArweave\n\nArweave 是最好的 NFT 基础设施项目，其去中心化数据存储架构将支持未来的很多 NFT 项目，这些项目希望将数据存储在 AWS 或其他中心化服务以外的其他地方。与 Filecoin 等其他数据存储项目相比，它的市值仍然被低估 。\n我个人持有很多其他项目代币，但这些是我主要的赌注，每周都有一个带有 NFT 概念的新项目浮出水面，因此可能会继续跟踪其交易额 + 销售趋势，只是为了抓住这些机会\n其他\n\n我对大多数 NFT 项目的了解，不如我对替代币生态系统的那么了如指掌，因此需要对这一板块做更多的研究，需要更仔细地研究：项目如何向用户进行空投并启动新的迭代\n例如 <https://cyberkongz.medium.com/the-next-leap-in-cyberkongz-evolution-e8ea8a064b26>\n元宇宙项目\nAxie Infinity\n\nAXS 是当前链游领域无可匹敌的领导者。在市场其他部分价格触底之前，它是第一个从 6 月份低点强力反弹的山寨币，并且已经巩固盘整了几个月。\n他们的仍在为用户提供价值，即使是与包括所有 DeFi 替代币的协议相比，仍然是利润最为丰厚的协议。他们即将推出的质押应该是一个很好的催化剂，为下一个趋势走势铺平道路。\nAXS 的主要风险是随着它的人气不断爆棚，它如何处理扩展到更多用户的问题，我想要更深入研究他们对此有何计划。\nVulcan\n\nPYR 是我研究过的低市值游戏项目之一。老实说，对它我还没有像我对其他游戏那样深入研究，但他们正在构建一个完整的 NFT DApp 生态系统和 NFT 市场。我玩过其中一些游戏，从技术分析来看，其币价走势图表看起来很棒。\n对明年的整体随想\n问题一：所有资产大跌 90%、出现多年熊市的可能性有多大？\n\n我个人认为，随着加密资产的人气变得越来越高，这种情况越来越不可能发生，因为我们看到，当前流入加密领域的资金 / 用户超过以往任何时期。我认为，有太多被搁置的资金和积极的开发活动，导致价格不可能多年出现连续多年的跌跌不休。\n我们看到今年衍生品溢价 / 未平仓合约（OI）过热+泡沫破灭，这些都下跌了约 70+%，但之后我们只是横盘整理了三个月，然后又回升。由于替代币资产以如此快的速度变成抛物线，因此价格回撤通常非常陡峭。\n自加密货币诞生以来的任何其他阶段，都没有发生这种情况，因为加密货币现在受到了公众的广泛关注，所以我相信，2022 年不会再度触及 2021 年创下的低点。必须发生类似新冠肺炎疫情这样几十年一次的打击事件，才可能导致这种情况，导致严重的崩盘。我相信如果市场再次过热，-70% 回撤+ 再次横盘是可能的，但我认为在更大幅的上涨之前，不太可能出现这种情况。由于 SBF 的公众形象，以及他一再积极地强调希望与监管机构合作，FTX 会成为核心话题，并吸引公众视野的关注，这对加密货币来说是一个巨大的福音，这也是我认为 SOL 比其他 L1 具有优势的另一个原因。从发展角度、公众认知角度、制度角度或监管角度而言，现在再将 2017 年与 2021 年进行比较是没有意义的。\n加密作为一种资产类别的成熟，意味着只要经济健康，加密资产最终应该开始与标普 500 指数一起上涨，加密的上涨空间比目前任何其他资产类别都要大得多，但即使它的规模已经赶上其它资产类别，正如我们在 FAANG 等公司中看到的那样，加密仍可实现稳定增长。我相信，随着人们希望收获超越传统市场的利润，我们将会看到越来越多的机构 / 对冲基金进入加密领域，负责为高净值人士投资的专业人士必然会被问到：为什么他们没有对加密货币进行配资，这意味着：加密资产的波动性应该在未来几年开始收窄。\n问题二：什么将成为 2020 年代的杀手级应用？ 2010 年代是亚马逊、2000 年代初是 Facebook，在元宇宙领域中会是什么样子的应用？如何吸引数以百万的非加密用户？\n\n这是我经常回顾的问题之一，因为它帮助我在更长的时间框架内构想想法。我打赌，未来十年用户会涌入加密领域，将带来用户与技术交互方式的重大转变。\n例如， 一个元宇宙 / 社交网络中，人们拥有一个包含所有 NFT/ 艺术 / 数字土地 / 炫耀性（Flex）物品的公共地址；一个可以轻松用作储蓄账户的私人地址，利用 USDC / UST 等稳定币产生收益；一个用于 DEX 交易 / 其他交易的私人地址。所有这些都通过没有差别的用户体验实现连接，人们可以在其中相互发送消息。这个方面，值得思考的问题是：\n如何在一个地方创建包含社交网络 / 银行 / 游戏的无缝体验？\n能在什么平台上构建它？\n将如何向新用户和数百万人推广这一应用？（通过）游戏化？（通过） NFT？\n问题三：哪个没有讨论到的细分市场会在未来几个月 / 明年人气爆棚？\n\n如果 2018 年问这个问题，答案是 DeFi；\n如果 2019 年问这个问题， 答案是 NFT\n我不确定下一个主要趋势是什么，但也经常重新思考这个问题。\n总之，更泛泛而言，我想要花时间更详细了解 L1 技术堆栈之间的差异。我的大部分时间都花在加密交易和开发上，所以我想在有时间的时候平衡一下。\n\n来源链接：[blknoiz06.substack.com](http://blknoiz06.substack.com)", "timestamp": 1633749481, "digest": "Eq59qbXkHBDO5nZt7won3ud9PvJ7spamXuFlhooT9s8",

Memes to go\n\n\n---\n\n### What is CityDAO?\n\nThe CityDAO community is made up of ambitious and HIGHLY curious people exploring and building at the frontier of technology, governance and physical land.\n\nThe vision of CityDAO is to build the city of the future on the Ethereum blockchain by tokenizing land, rights, and governance.\n\n## 🔈CityDAO so far\n\nFirst, let’s do a quick recap of the CityDAO adventure so far:\n\n**Month 1: July - laying the groundwork**\n\n* **July 1** - DAOs can legally be recognized as an LLC in Wyoming\n* **July 2** - CityDAO starts (Scott’s infamous tweet)\n* **July 7** - First community call\n* **July 15** - CityDAO Discord membership crosses 1000 people\n* **July 23** - CityDAO officially registered as an LLC in Wyoming\n* **July 28** - CityDAO gets voted in on Mirror’s $WRITE RACE\n\n**Month 2: August - bolstering the treasury**\n\n* **August 8** - The First Citizen NFT sells for 6.52 ETH\n* **August 11** - Release Founding Citizen NFTs\n* **August 12** - CityDAO treasury passes $30k\n* **August 20** - CityDAO treasury passes $100k\n* **August 25** - Founding Citizen NFT sells for 10 ETH live in a community call\n* **August 25** - CityDAO treasury passes $250k\n* **August 26** - Connect w/ real estate agent in Wyoming to help with land purchase\n\n**Month 3: September - voting on land acquisition**\n\n* **September 08** - CityDAO forum is added to aid governance discussions\n* **September 15** - Dev & Design team demo the parcel viewer\n* **September 21** - CityDAO citizens vote on first parcel purchase\n* **September 27** - Citizens vote to make offer on “Parcel 6” (40 acres)\n* **September 28** - CityDAO makes an offer on real land\n* **September 28** - Offer accepted, land purchase process begins\n\n### Live footage of CityDAO going from tweet to citizens voting on putting an offer on 40 acres of real Wyoming land…in 3 months 😂 :\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vKOY51NA2DwmZbQoll1rV.gif?height=400&width=480)\n\n\n---\n\n# 🔈News & Updates\n\n# 🗞 Annnnd our DAO has officially purchased land! 🎊\n\n![WAGMI vibes right here](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FmbW8L0eDN3hh_cUBjUlE.png?height=702&width=1043)\n\n![CityDAO flag going up on the land](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/H-C4tGhmdYUCcJalTF-H5.png?height=1398&width=1054)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k2kW3fYZebFAqQJTUNbuz.png?height=197&width=375)\n\n### 🗞 OpenSea de-listed CityDAO\n\n[https://twitter.com/chadfowler/status/1444365420388044806?s=20](https://twitter.com/chadfowler/status/1444365420388044806?s=20)\n\n**What happened?**\n\nWe found out the NFTs were de-listed from new members asking why they couldn’t buy a Citizen NFT. We received no notification, e-mail or information at all from OpenSea as to what happened. We sent multiple support tickets, reached out in their Discord server, and finally got some answers after utilizing our collective networks to get a hold of someone there.\n\n**Why did they de-list the NFTs?**\n\nSince land tokenization is central to our DAO and these NFTs would give access to land drops they believe the NFTs went against their terms. They explained its because OpenSea doesn't allow listing real estate. Our NFTs are not real estate but they don’t want to support anything that could be related.\n\n[OpenSea experienced controversy](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58585342) in September with an insider trading situation. They are likely highly risk-averse right now.\n\n### 🗞 What’s next? Solution: create independent smart contract (in development)\n\n1. The new one will be ERC721 and 100% independent of any exchange. Minting will be done through our site.\n2. Once ready, previous NFTs can be exchanged 1:1 with the new ones at any time, and they have the same rights/value.\n\n### 🗞 When will Citizen NFTs be available again?\n\nTimeline TBD but we anticipate it being in the near-future. Please reach out if you have any questions or have experience in this space. We’ll post in #announcements once we have updates.\n\n### 🗞 Parcel Viewer - here’s a glimpse of the CityDAO parcel explorer! @Greg, @Bpetes, @odyslam and @scott have been on fire with this one 🔥\n\n> A web app to view & trade CityDAO land parcels\n\n[Here’s a link to a 45 second Loom for a better view](https://www.loom.com/share/a9adac738b2d4003a12ad3359e26f846).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/snbdoc4j5qWBAm4A4Kf5O.gif?height=270&width=480)\n\n### 🗞 So… Balaji’s call-to-action sounds fun.

More updates will come for Citizens shortly as negotiations proceed\n\ntheir top execs are aware of it and should get back to us soon. Regardless, we are in parallel working on our own, independent way to buy and trade the citizen nfts.\n\nfeels like a historic moment, reading it now!\n\nHow do i get citizenship?\n\nThis is awesome. You guys have obviously been kicking ass. I've not been checking in and here you got your land already!\n\nI am experienced in Computer Vision and have recently been using Drones for mapping and training CV models to detect objects from the air.\n\nI cannot wait for property and realspace assets are on the blockchain.\n\nhave heard quite a lot of people discussing citydao lately and wanted to hop in and say hello\n\njust to discuss, casually, perhaps over dinner and not during official hours, about possibly changes in the land registration process\n\nHey all, I haven't been around for a couple months, but I wanted to say I'm blown away with all the progress that's been made!\n\nI've been doing some research into water rights in Wyoming. Here's a summary of the laws in a government memo, but it's from 2001 (and it looks like the source document could be even older)\n\nThis is one of the most interesting projects I've ever seen in crypto, not just in NFT. I'm waiting for the bar results right now, but if all goes well i'll be a cryptolawyer soon!\n\nbuying one parcel as a DAO is our first step, and allowing members to own a piece of that parcel. the city aspect comes as more people start building on the land and we deal with questions like what is allowed to be built and funding public goods.\n\nThe land is in Wyoming. It's very rural - 40 minutes north west of Cody, Wyoming\n\nout of curiosity, are they referring to this CityDAO or maybe they're just referring to CityDAOs in a general sense?\n\nCommunity Call happening now - we will go over the land parcels and DAO citizens will share the reasons they like or dislike each parcel. Will be a fun time, see ya soon!\n\nFormer commercial real estate finance underwriting pro (mostly CMBS type stuff, some CDOs) based in Brooklyn.\n\nuseless observation -- \"Kirschbaum\" (current owner?) means \"Cherry Tree\"\n\nI'd also say there's another layer of deeper questions being asked here beyond just streamlining ownership and revenue generation\n\nHey all, love what you’re doing. Awesome to see the beginnings of on chain land ownership.\n\nI am a commercial property developer from South Africa.\n\nInteresting documents on Well water quality and Disclosures from the broker today on Parcel 6\n\nExcited to give what I can to this community and hopefully build the future of cities with you all!\n\nI'm a software engineer, working on building 5G networks. Outside of that, I host The Urban Loop podcast where I talk to technologists and city leaders about building the Smart Cities of the future\n\nLast chance to vote on the land parcel!\n\nthey gave us no explanation, but it was shortly after i requested verification for the collection. i think its because our project is tokenizing real assets\n\nWhat's good citiziens of citydao, my friend just turned me on to this. Just came back from Wyoming on a massive 4,500 mile roadtrip\n\n## 🐦 Some recent tweets we love\n\n[https://twitter.com/CroissantEth/status/1443971953187069955?s=20](https://twitter.com/CroissantEth/status/1443971953187069955?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/nichanank/status/1438205060777865218?s=20](https://twitter.com/nichanank/status/1438205060777865218?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/anotherjohnbeck/status/1439325370742833152?s=20](https://twitter.com/anotherjohnbeck/status/1439325370742833152?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/gid3xn/status/1442249426668376066?s=20](https://twitter.com/gid3xn/status/1442249426668376066?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/spaghettiNFT/status/1443493722474221574?s=20](https://twitter.com/spaghettiNFT/status/1443493722474221574?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/BoredElonMusk/status/1446316443247595520?s=20](https://twitter.com/BoredElonMusk/status/1446316443247595520?s=20)\n\n\n---\n\n# ☕️ Resources shared in CityDAO\n\n[https://twitter.com/theindiedao/status/1445410822134501386?s=20](https://twitter.com/theindiedao/status/1445410822134501386?s=20)\n\n## 🎨 Meme to go\n\n**H/T to @Greg for this spicy meme 🌶**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g-6lBZ_pPFp_J5akUZtiw.png?height=992&width=898)\n\n**H/T to @Justin Kalland**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1mBD6wn2XjIHzlLImsu2X.png?height=500&width=750)\n\n### Past CityDAO Roundups\n\n[https://chance.ghost.io/citydao-community-roundup-vol-1-so-it-begins/](https://chance.ghost.io/citydao-community-roundup-vol-1-so-it-begins/)\n\n[https://city.mirror.xyz/jTi0-xQOMadDgvP_KgMOoHZaYvWJY6D7YK4bcdFz-f4](https://city.mirror.xyz/jTi0-xQOMadDgvP_KgMOoHZaYvWJY6D7YK4bcdFz-f4)\n\n[https://city.mirror.xyz/4t6MRC8re_vTuJiVqkKmJTPXBpurzwb1N3v8S6bSJJs](https://city.mirror.xyz/4t6MRC8re_vTuJiVqkKmJTPXBpurzwb1N3v8S6bSJJs)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633749923, "digest": "1HoGdPHJ4NBmLW_sEun299_QiZTl5WHQAZfa9G8J8NY", "contributor": "0x77aA943A365161e499eaFF59E936a799e6051e15"}

On every issue, we feature one artist that we think is super cool.\n\nWhen I got the gig, I personally have a mission to feature various kinds of art styles or mediums. I, personally, don’t want to just see 3D renders forever looping as they move, something that I personally can’t create… *yet*. I do graphic design, so most of my works are text-heavy posters possibly mixed with stock photo or illustrations. I don’t illustrate. I don’t do 3D renders. I don’t see myself in the space (yet), and I don’t want others to feel the same.\n\n### What am I currently doing\n\nI place all the artists I feature on a spreadsheet, and what kind of art do they make as an NFT. I also check and write from which countries do these artists come from. Not only do I want to be the kinds of artworks being made into NFTs be diverse, but also the people that we feature.\n\nI am proud to say that I’ve featured artists from Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. These artists have covered fields like photography, dancing, graphic design, watercolor, illustrations, doodles, and more.\n\nTo see who I have featured on the newsletter, you may check out my collection on Yup.\n\n[https://app.yup.io/collections/cup-of-nft-featured-artists/T4FRpxn](https://app.yup.io/collections/cup-of-nft-featured-artists/T4FRpxn)\n\nYou may also scroll to the last part of this post to see their works.\n\n*Note: I have yet to check out the 18 issues sent before I entered the picture, and a couple more issues while I was already in Cup.*\n\n## Some things I’ve noticed or I reflected on\n\n### Types of Media\n\nI haven’t featured any music or video NFTs. For music, I think it will be just like sharing a song I like that I discovered on Spotify. For video, I’m looking for longer videos, not your usual 3D render loops or 10-second clips. JPEGs, PNGs, and GIFs had their spotlight for so long.\n\n### Platforms\n\nAll of the artists I’ve featured, I discovered through Foundation or Showtime. Just being able to follow people on the platform where you saw them is a great way for me to “bookmark” these artists.\n\nIt just happens to be a coincidence when we feature an artist that’s on H=N. It’s just not a platform that I check out. Although, thinking about it, I should… as well as with other marketplaces on different networks like Polygon, NEAR, and Flow. If I am in a position where I can possibly make an artist’s first sale through featuring them, I might as well do that for artists who have less capital.\n\n### What we can do better\n\nWith the various kinds of media and platforms to check out and feature, we must give more space for creators and not just limit it to one. Maybe we can start off with having one artist from various networks, or one from each kind of media (photo, video, music, graphics).\n\nFeaturing more artists may sound like an easy solution, but it isn’t if you’re just two people doing the newsletter with other parts to work on as well. I think that we should get more people to contribute, even if it’s just with the artist feature part, maybe representing a certain network or marketplace. But now, the problem is compensation.\n\nI personally am being paid for my contributions for the newsletter, and I don’t really mind not being paid. I’m working on other projects in the space and those are the ones paying the bills. Privilege checked, I am pretty aware that this isn’t the case for everyone.\n\nAs much as I want to feature more artists and get more people to contribute and provide a different perspective, we can’t sustain that when our newsletter is free.\n\nWe’ve had some donations through Gitcoin, and I’m guessing that some of the money that I’m being paid with came from that, but the donations we got can’t even sustain getting more people too.\n\n### Send help!\n\nWe’d love to know what you think about the newsletter! If you’re not subscribed to Cup of NFT, [why not try it out](https://cupofnft.com/)? And if you’ve been checking out the past issue, do give us some feedback!\n\nWe’re thinking of keeping the news part bulleted and not have a cover story, in exchange of featuring more artists. As a reader, do you want to see more artist features? Should we get rid of other parts in exchange of that? Should we consider doing an NFT crowdfund or a sponsorship NFT to generate revenue? We have so many questions, so feel free to send us your thoughts!\n\nYou may DM us on Twitter [@0xElle](https://twitter.com/0xElle/), [@belGIANgwaffles](https://twitter.com/belgiangwaffles), and/or [@cupofnft](https://twitter.com/cupofnft/)!\n\nAnyways, that’s the end of this post. See you next Wednesday for another issue of Cup of NFT! We usually send out the newsletter around 9PM local time (UTC+8).\n\nJust for kicks…\n\n## Here’s the artists I’ve featured!\n\n### Ashmit Galav\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/40692](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/40692)\n\n### p1xelfool\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/58974](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/58974)\n\n### 3landboy\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/57339](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/57339)\n\n### TokBLOK\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/11748](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/11748)\n\n### Dylan Mayoral\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/61189](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/61189)\n\n### Mu-am\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/59111](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/59111)\n\n### Bilnd\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/54970](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/54970)\n\n### Oelhan\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/2327](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/2327)\n\n### Linda Dounia\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/76091](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/76091)\n\n### Di-Andre Caprice Davise\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/80831](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/80831)\n\n### Adesola Yusuf\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/55547](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/55547)\n\n### Joey Pecoraro\n\n[ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/4078](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/4078)\n\n### AuroraSector\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/58938](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/58938)\n\n### Typeflood\n\n[ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/4921](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/4921)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633750675, "digest": "zd2GCJvV986n9IENGIU69y5T1jwtR4bb1hwA67mTm-A", "contributor": "0x2bD5d2e3d5852AD9960638083cb7c9F493E7A597"}

goodbye！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QtBBZ4FtiSi4BeolD0avl.png?height=200&width=1080)\n\n 标题有些唬人吧，是这样的，2019年11月22日，杭州市中级人民法院22日公开宣判浙江省丽水市人民政府原副市长林康受贿案，对被告人林康以受贿罪判处有期徒刑14年，并处罚金人民币三百万元。对林康受贿犯罪所得赃款予以追缴，上缴国库。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EwlW4NEyfHVQuWCQXuqVC.png?height=291&width=529)\n\n \n\n一个副市长，何以沦落至此？\n\n听起来原因有点搞笑，但是实际情况就放在那。我们先看法院资料：经法院审理查明，2008年至2016年，被告人林康利用担任丽水市松阳县人民政府县长、中共景宁畲族自治县县委书记等职务之便，为有关单位及个人在房地产开发、工程承接、土地拆迁补偿等事项上谋取利益。2005年至2018年，被告人林康多次收受上述单位及个人给予的财物，共计折合人民币4196.2349万元。\n\n好的，接下来问题来了，一般人用不了这么多钱吧，你要这么多钱到底是做啥子呢？浙江省纪检委调查发现，林康敛财最直接的原因和动力就是炒股，一有余钱就往股市投，违纪违法所得基本都进了股市。\n\n那很多人问，不是有政策，为官是不能炒股的吗？图样图森破啦，我可以用朋友账户，非直系亲属账户嘛，方法总比困难多。\n\n**除了利用自有资金炒股，林康还频繁向老板借资炒股。牛逼吧，四千万炒股都不够用，还要向人借钱炒股。**\n\n那到底为何会亏这么多钱呢？原因人纪检委也调查到了，2017年底和2018年，林康听信所谓的“内部消息”，轻信买入，一买就被套，被套又想翻身，然后越陷越深。\n\n林康坦言：“如今我的几个账户资金被套达30%，账面浮亏超千万元。我这几年集资和受贿收入基本都投在股市里，接下来违纪违法收入上缴，正当收入又几乎亏净。这几年的瞎折腾最后是人财两空，唯一‘赚’的就是接下来的牢狱之灾。真是悔不当初啊！”\n\n啥意思？受贿几千万拿去炒股，结果因为听信所谓内幕信息，得了个竹篮打水不算，还有14年的牢狱之灾。**这真是绝了！**\n\n当然，我这个案例有些过于极端了，你们用信息炒股大概率是不会有牢狱之灾的，最多也就是一个倾家荡产而已。\n\n我说这个事情，主要是想告诉你们，看到没，人一个市长，权利有没有你大？资源有没有你多？金钱有没有你厚实？这样的人，都因为小道信息和宏观消息给割的不要不要的，你是什么货色？请扪心自问一下。 \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8UGpiMoyPdFWwWuWfmuPF.png?height=200&width=1080)\n\n接下来，我们来讲讲原因：不知道看完上面的案例大家扪心自问了多久，没有的话，我再来给你泼泼冷水。\n\n听清楚了，**你几斤几两？**能指望这些宏观政策变动和小道消息给你带来高收益？恕我直言，连庄家、交易所甚至是一些大财团们，都很难从这些消息中获利。更何况，你我这些地沟油命的小散？\n\n这个世界，特别是金融市场，信息不对称是永久性存在的，而且只会愈演愈烈，不要觉得互联网时代啥玩意在你面前那都是透明的一样，很多信息传递到你这边，可能已经经历了无数次传播。你拿到当宝的信息，可能是三手四手五手信息了。那你还玩个毛啊，不被割才怪！\n\n除非你是政策的制定者，或者是靠近他们的特殊人群，能在政策发布之前就布好局，否则等消息散布出来的那一刻，已经晚了。但是，不管你愿不愿意承认，你我都是最后收到消息的人。早就有人布好局，等着我们了。难道不是吗？\n\n既然如此，为什么还要热衷于干这件愚蠢的事情呢？！浪费生命也罢了，要是入了别人的局出不来，就更得不偿失了。所以，多年以来，我一直都践行这个思想：**既然没能力制定或掌握一手信息，那么对于市场上24小时满天飞的信息（垃圾），最优策略只有一个：选择无视，无为而治才是王道。**\n\n \n 因为资讯尚且还能让你凭借“回字有几种写法”增加一些吹牛扯淡的素材资本，而消息，则百害而无一利，分分钟让你身陷囹圄，有苦说不出。\n\n众所周知，如果你是做短线的话，平常都是在和庄家博弈，没有庄家的玩意基本没人去碰，因为很难出现大涨幅，在了解了这种情况后，咱们再来看看庄家和散户的优势，庄家靠着大资金控盘通过控制股价波动套牢散户赚取差价盈利，其优势为资金量大，消息获得的提前性，短线散户通过预判庄家走势，来盈利，其优势为资金交易的便利性。\n\n那问题来了，如果你每日就看各种信息，最终给你的只会有一个感觉就是：**无限焦虑。**\n\n我来给个大家经常经历的场景：\n\n听到某个大V发布了内幕消息：今天某币项目方要发布自己的公链新功能，肯定会大涨。你看到后，很嗨，就买入。这个时候，你面临两个问题。如果真涨了，那你还想多赚一些，你不会愿意出。你还希望得到更多的信息，询问更多的所谓“内幕人士”，看能不能赚更多的钱。如果跌了呢？你就不知如何处置了，你询问透露消息的人士，对于何时卖出他（她）肯定也是十分茫然，为什么？因为哪一个点是获利出局的点位主力是绝对不会泄露的，而且这个目标位也是随着市场变化而随时进行修正。所以你就不断地迷茫，最后亏钱！如果你赚了，大概率也是运气。\n\n扪心自问一下自己的操作，是不是这样的？是这样的话，就赶紧打自己两巴掌吧。\n\n如果说，数字货币的波动还不能够说明问题的话，那么，经历过那次中国股市“熔断”的股民，可能这辈子都会刻骨铭心，特别是那些做股指期货交易的人。当熔断机制公布之时，很多人觉得是好事，也有很多人觉得是损招。于是，就在新规实施的第一天，股指就真特么熔断了，就犹如审判日降临，灭霸的响指弹响，一瞬间，尸横片野、血流成河。\n\n倘若你还不知道股指跌停是什么概念、对股指期货交易者来说意味着什么，请现场百度一下，或者请教一下身边的当事人，如果他们还活着的话。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FHVu0z225kUKxGo5lNcys.png?height=200&width=1080)\n\nok，干货来了！**既然对外界的资讯和消息选择无视，那么我们应该重视什么呢？**\n\n事实上，任何消息（比如国家对数字货币的政策风向、哪个交易所的突发事件、哪个爱西欧代币的团队是优是劣。等等等等），真的假的、对的错的，最终都会反映到哪里？没错！最终都会反映到盘面上来！盘面是整个战场的主阵地，那些其他的东西都是为这个主阵地服务的。\n\n如果市场上一个消息，反映到盘面上出现暴涨。对于我来说，当趋势形成，构成买入条件，只管买进就好了，一直涨就一直持有。如果市场上一个消息，反映到盘面上出现暴跌。对于我来说，持仓趋势破位之时，或止盈或止损，坚决抛出了结，直到下一次构成买入条件。\n\n到那时候，原本它是好消息还是坏消息。还有任何意义吗？\n\n**你看，这个复杂吗？一点都不复杂。**\n\n如果对任何盘面变化足够敏感、有应对措施的话，那么，为什么还要去关注那些扑朔迷离的消息呢？关注盘面就足够了！这不复杂，但很重要。需要你静下心来好好思考一下，底层原因是什么。\n\n我们都知道，短期内盘面的涨跌，是由供求关系决定的。买的人多卖的人少，价格就会涨，买的人少卖的人多，价格自然会跌。短期的供求关系，的确会很大程度上受到消息面的影响，有宏观的关于整个数字货币行业的消息面，也有微观的关于某个货币的消息面。\n\n但是，我不需要关心它们是好是坏，我唯一关心的，永远只是盘面。因为，任何一种消息，哪怕它表现得再好，反映到盘面上，也可能是一种突发的灾难；任何一种消息，哪怕它表现得再坏，反映到盘面上，也可能是一次难得的机会。听懂没有？**盘面，才是最终决定消息好坏的审判官，而不是你我。**\n\n**消息会扑朔迷离、真假难辨，而盘面则永远无法伪装，盘面的变化，对每个市场参与者都是百分百公平的。**我们根本无需绞尽脑汁、费尽心思去考证消息的真伪对错、去意淫消息对盘面会产生什么样的影响，因为任何消息都会最终反映到盘面的走势上，我们只需要应对盘面的变化就行了。\n\n**我们没有能力也不追求能先知先觉、先市场而动，相比于市场上绝大多数参与者从来都是不知不觉，我们只求能做到后知后觉、动而辄随。这，就足够了。**\n\n说到底，不管这个行业怎么有钱途、未来会怎么演变，作为普通人，要想从中分一杯羹，无非是参与交易获利，低买高卖、“低级趣味”，仅此而已。\n\n回想一下，你关注的全球行业趋势变化的所谓“高级趣味”，你关注的区块链领域技术增长动向，一级市场风云变幻的所谓“高级趣味”，某个上市公司管理层动荡的所谓“高级趣味”。回想一下，对你炒币炒股赚钱有太大帮助吗？\n\n你可能不太愿意相信，就连市场上的庄家，都不太关心这些“高级趣味”的资讯和消息。庄家只奉行：**如果不能制造消息，就利用消息，如果不能利用消息，就无视消息。一买，一卖，谓之道也。**\n\n                                                               ×××\n\n**结语：**看到这里，老吴知道，你们很多人都想通了，去NM的，那些大V还有什么还关注的，都是没用的货。对咯，能这么想你就走出了第一步！那社群要不要多进呢？也别进！进什么社群？社群里纷杂的信息只会让你更焦虑。交易求的是一个专注、专注需要孤独！你首先得关注的，就是你自身，而不是他人，更不是外部环境。让那些大V都见鬼去吧，包括**比特吴**（当然，你们如果愿意听我讲讲故事我也挺乐意）都是垃圾，垃圾，垃圾！\n\n**不管鲤鱼从哪条河中来，最终都会朝着龙门跃起，守住龙门，就能抓住龙。庄家尚且如此，何况韭菜乎？**\n\n当然以上说的不一定适合所有人，有的人天生就他妈是看盘面的天才，能找到蛛丝马迹和盘面中的最底层逻辑，有的人他不爱看这个，而且怎么练习也无望。我觉得这都不要慌，你首先得搞清楚自己是哪一类人。王阳明的知行合一，这个“知”并不是知道的“知”，而是内心的良知，反映的是内心的情况，可见任何事情都必须先搞清楚自身才能做到“合一”，合一了才能挣钱，针对交易，这就是规律！\n\n所以你要想清楚，你的定位在哪里？如果你是第一类，那上面方法一定适用。如果你是第二类，也别急，参考我之前的一篇文章：[《投资底层逻辑构建必读丨一篇被粉丝以死相逼要求重发一遍的宝藏深度文》](https://weibo.cn/sinaurl?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmp.weixin.qq.com%2Fs%3F__biz%3DMzIxNjc3OTcwMQ%3D%3D%26amp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bmid%3D2247486756%26amp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bidx%3D1%26amp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bsn%3D1e137e0102e0a3a80767b11e3a05f3c3%26amp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bchksm%3D978293fea0f51ae85ec3141a2ef2f5f3b31433c816df62da3b7cfbd2834efaf9ee5db5c65daa%26amp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bscene%3D21%23wechat_redirect)，这里有给你的更为深刻的方法，读完后依然可以找到很好的投资路径，比如定投，比如曾国藩式的\"扎硬寨，打死仗\"；\"先自治，后制敌\"；\"深沟高垒，地道攻城，水陆配合，以静制动\"；\"先拔根本，后除枝叶\"等等。\n\n所以看懂没有，投资方法没有对错，适用自己都好！但是最怕的就是你是第二类人，却非要装逼去做K线玩合约妄想一夜暴富，或者你是第一类人却非要到处搜集小道消息乱搞一通。这才是大忌。**知行合一，最为关键！**\n\n所以，如果你现在深刻认识了这一点，那你就能明白，只有实实在在做好自己，才能成为赢家。你也就能理解，**为什么我要做一个安静的、脱离了“高级趣味”的、坚守“低级趣味”的币圈老韭菜，纹丝不动，无问西东。**",

×××\n```\n\n**结语：看到这里，老吴知道，你们很多人都想通了，去NM的，那些大V还有什么还关注的，都是没用的货。对咯，能这么想你就走出了第一步！那社群要不要多进呢？也别进！进什么社群？社群里纷杂的信息只会让你更焦虑。交易求的是一个专注、专注需要孤独！你首先得关注的，就是你自身，而不是他人，更不是外部环境。让那些大V都见鬼去吧，包括**比特吴（当然，你们如果愿意听我讲讲故事我也挺乐意）都是垃圾，垃圾，垃圾！\n\n**不管鲤鱼从哪条河中来，最终都会朝着龙门跃起，守住龙门，就能抓住龙。庄家尚且如此，何况韭菜乎？**\n\n当然以上说的不一定适合所有人，有的人天生就他妈是看盘面的天才，能找到蛛丝马迹和盘面中的最底层逻辑，有的人他不爱看这个，而且怎么练习也无望。我觉得这都不要慌，你首先得搞清楚自己是哪一类人。王阳明的知行合一，这个“知”并不是知道的“知”，而是内心的良知，反映的是内心的情况，可见任何事情都必须先搞清楚自身才能做到“合一”，合一了才能挣钱，针对交易，这就是规律！\n\n所以你要想清楚，你的定位在哪里？如果你是第一类，那上面方法一定适用。如果你是第二类，也别急，参考我之前的一篇文章：[《投资底层逻辑构建必读丨一篇被粉丝以死相逼要求重发一遍的宝藏深度文》](https://weibo.cn/sinaurl?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmp.weixin.qq.com%2Fs%3F__biz%3DMzIxNjc3OTcwMQ%3D%3D%26amp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bmid%3D2247486756%26amp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bidx%3D1%26amp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bsn%3D1e137e0102e0a3a80767b11e3a05f3c3%26amp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bchksm%3D978293fea0f51ae85ec3141a2ef2f5f3b31433c816df62da3b7cfbd2834efaf9ee5db5c65daa%26amp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3Bscene%3D21%23wechat_redirect)，这里有给你的更为深刻的方法，读完后依然可以找到很好的投资路径，比如定投，比如曾国藩式的\"扎硬寨，打死仗\"；\"先自治，后制敌\"；\"深沟高垒，地道攻城，水陆配合，以静制动\"；\"先拔根本，后除枝叶\"等等。\n\n所以看懂没有，投资方法没有对错，适用自己都好！但是最怕的就是你是第二类人，却非要装逼去做K线玩合约妄想一夜暴富，或者你是第一类人却非要到处搜集小道消息乱搞一通。这才是大忌。**知行合一，最为关键！**\n\n所以，如果你现在深刻认识了这一点，那你就能明白，只有实实在在做好自己，才能成为赢家。你也就能理解，**为什么我要做一个安静的，脱离了“高级趣味”的、坚守“低级美食”的币圈老韭菜，纹丝不动，无问西东。**",

NFTのマス化が進めば芸能事務所のような仕組みができていく\n\n実際、「事務所」という名前ではないものの、日本の芸能事務所に相当する仕事をやっているNFTの取引所はあると思うのですが、「Cryptoアーティストの所属事務所」と言語化されると確かにあるなと思いました。今日はこの事務所ができた場合に、Cryptoアーティストに対してどのようなアドバイスができるかを考えてみたいと思います\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hideaki-97c59.appspot.com/o/images%2FlHn2Bn5im1Zex0k1pQyMp0W8eJn2%2FMD4XBoGA-.png?alt=media)\n[https://twitter.com/CHAICHAI_Tokyo/status/1443532072857976835](https://twitter.com/CHAICHAI_Tokyo/status/1443532072857976835)\n\n## NFTを高く売るためのフレームワークとチェック項目リスト\n\nチェック項目を作ってNFT販売前に「高く売れるNFTの条件」をフレームワークがあると便利かと思いますので、自分なりに作っていきたいと思います。公開後の意見を反映して随時更新していくつもりですがSubstackを更新するのは面倒なので、Notionを最新版とします。そのため、[Notionのこちらのページ](https://www.notion.so/Daily-Topics-NFT-15-799a0b6986bb467ca9d6c2550c181657)をブックマークしておくと良いと思います。NFT販売を考える時に参考にしてください。\n\nまずは5W1Hのフレームワークで考えます。\n\n### WHO：誰が\n\n*   [ ]  誰がCryptoアーティストとしてNFTを販売するのか。という点です。\n    アーティストの方が行うのであれば自己分析ですね。過去の制作実績、Twitterなどのフォロワー数、影響力、現在のポジションなどを客観的に見て自分をNFT界隈のどのポジションに身を置くべきかを考えます。\n    逆に買う時は誰が作っているのかが重要になるということです。販売者やサポーターにインフルエンサーが入っていれば露出量が増え、完売する可能性が高そうなので買ってみようという気持ちになるものです\n\n### When：タイミング\n\n*   [ ]  いつ売り始めるのか？\n    現在のNFTトレンドにおいて、どのタイミングに合わせるかです。NFT販売のピークなのかバブルなのかはわかりませんが、SushiswapのshoyuやRaribleのOSS化などNFT関連のニュースが増えるタイミングは事前情報から予測できます。販売するNFTの特性に合わせてどのタイミングでNFT販売すべきか検討すべきです\n*   [ ]  （購入する場合）いつ販売されたものか\n\n    これは売るではなく買うですが、CryptoPunksは最古のNFTシリーズとして骨董品的な価値を持っています。同じくCryptoCrystalもPunksほどではないですが、発行されたのが2018年なので骨董品として価値が出始めました。\n    「古いものにほど価値がある」というのは劣化することで希少性が高まる前提の現在アートから来ている価値観なので、劣化せず希少性も変わらないデジタルアートにも同じ価値観が適用されるかは個人的に疑問視しているのですが、現段階においてはデジタルアートにおいても「骨董品」は存在しています。劣化はしないがGOXで希少価値は高まるので古いものの希少性は高いは当てはまるような気もします。\n\n### Where：どこで売るか\n\nNFTは通常の商材と異なり１次販売だけでなく、２次流通も視野に入れて検討する必要があります。\n\n*   [ ]  １次販売はどこで行うか\n\n    Openseaは右上のメニューから「Create」ができるので、それでNFT発行を行っている方も少なくないと思いますが、「NFTを高く売る」という観点からはあまりオススメできません。\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hideaki-97c59.appspot.com/o/images%2FlHn2Bn5im1Zex0k1pQyMp0W8eJn2%2Fdrr6ijA02.png?alt=media)\n\nOpenseaがあなたの代わりにNFT発行を代行してくれているだけなのでブロックチェーン上にはOpenseaの何万番目のNFTとしての記録しか残らず、毎日大量に発行されるNFTの中に埋もれてしまいます。高く売りたいのであれば、独自コントラクトでNFTを発行ことが望ましいです。\n\nまた、販売する場所ですが、ランディングページを作って自分でNFTのストーリーを伝えながら売るか、アート性の高く実績のあるアーティストなのであればFaundationやNifty Gatewayにアーティストとして登録して販促してもらうのが良いのではないでしょうか。販売する棚は多くの人に見られるほど購入してもらえる可能性は高まります。\n\n*   [ ]  ２次流通をどこでやってもらうか\n    これは購入するユーザーに決定権を委ねることになりますが、多くの人が慣れているOpenseaを案内するのが良いでしょう。ERC721基準で発行されたNFTであればOpenseaで表示されるのでNFTコレクターであれば購入できるはずです。\n\n### What：なにを売るか\n\nNFTを売る方のために書いているので「なにを」は「NFTを」になるのですが、NFTで提供できる価値には複数種類あります。NFTは資産価値を持つものなので、NFTに紐づく使いみちがなければ、新しくNFTを追加で発行するたびに供給量が増加するので、販売済みNFTの資産価値は下がっていき最初に買ってくれたロイヤルなファンからあなたの元から離れていってしまいます。\n\n*   [ ]  販売するアートで提供する機能を明確に意識する\n    個人的には、NFTで提供できる価値は６つあると思っています。詳細を説明し始めると長くなりすぎるのでこれを読んでほしいですが、Cryptoアート、ゲーム、漫画や有名人NFTそれぞれに紐づく機能はこのどこかに分類できてくるはずです。中途半端な特性のNFTを発行しようとしていないか今一度ご確認ください\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hideaki-97c59.appspot.com/o/images%2FlHn2Bn5im1Zex0k1pQyMp0W8eJn2%2FaZu3Qy7Dp.png?alt=media)\n\n[[Daily

⇒現時点でそのスキルがなくできないことでも先に行っておくことで期待感は煽ることができます。実現しなければ行動を評価されファンが離れることになりますが、言うからにはちょっと背伸びして達成可能そうな目標を設定しましょう\n\n### How：どんなふうに\n\nここが一番項目数の多い部分になります。\n\n*   [ ]  フルオンチェーンで発行されているか\n\nNFTに高額な価値をつけるNFTインベスター達は「Decentralであるか」を非常に重視します。OpenseaメニューからのNFT製作は簡単ですが、NFTの画像データがOpenseaのサーバーに保存されるので、Openseaが倒産した場合に画像データの参照先が無くなってしまうので本質的なCryptoアートではないとされています。\n\nPunksのようなdot絵のCryptoアートが流行っているのは画像データが非常に軽くブロックチェーン上に画像自体を保存することができ、運営やアートを作成したアーティストがいなくなったとしても永遠に残るからです。\n\nすでにNFT発行済みの方は、NFTの価値を高めるためにフルオンチェーン化を検討してみてはいかがでしょうか。Punksですらもあとからフルオンチェーン対応させているんですし。\n[Cryptopunksはフルオンチェーンになりました！画像と属性がこのコントラクトに完全に保存されます](https://www.notion.so/Cryptopunks-303ccb5f5284477f97953e8ddc2a6726)\n\n[共用コントラクトでmintしているということは、発行者に独自コントラクトを実装する力すらないと見て間違いない](https://www.notion.so/mint-56ac7e65698940fbba56df61e048e387) ←これは極論ではあるが、後々独自コントラクトverのNFTをAirdropしてあげればよいのではと思っています。\n\n*   [ ]  Generativeであるか\n\nこれは現在の流行りにかもしれませんが、ArtBlockやGenerativemasksのようにプログラミングによってNFTを見る度に見た目が変わったりするものがあります。\n[3億円で売れたNFT ArtBlocksについて｜miin｜note](https://www.notion.so/3-NFT-ArtBlocks-miin-note-2a4de63b93b44de18253b3d147720316)\nGenerativeが流行る理由としては単純な静止画よりも、見る度にアートが変化したほうが面白いし、人間の意図を介せずにアート作品が生成される点がブロックチェーンの思想とマッチしているから受け入れられているものだと思います。Bitcoinが人間を介さずに分散型で10年間稼働し続けていることを理解するとシンパシーを感じてもらえるのではないでしょうあか\n\n*   [ ]  希少性のコントロールは考えてあるか\n\n総数として何枚のNFTを生産するのか、すべて１点物なのか、複製絵を販売するのか決めていく必要があります。流行っているコレクティブル系のNFTは１万点発行され、すべてが１点物というスタイルのものが多いです。\n１万点を１人のアーティストで作っているのではなく、Hashmaskのように複数のアーティストの作ったものを組み合わせて組違いを作り数を増やしているものも多いです。\n[Hashmask[ハッシュマスク]](https://www.notion.so/Hashmask-3cda47c00aee49948725871caed02872)\\\n要素が揃えってしまえば、プログラムによって画像同士を重ね合わせることができます。この辺のやり方は12歳の少年がやり方からコードからなにからすべてを公開してくれており参考になります\n[12歳の少年がつくったコレクティブNFT#WeirdWhalesのストーリーが面白い](https://www.notion.so/12-NFT-WeirdWhales-5dccf880b7a44ee3828cfcb2c6d65930)\n\n*   [ ]  NFTをどうやって配布するのか？\n    誰からもらったのかによっては価値が付きやすいと考えています。\n    これは雨弓さんの高尚なボケですが、有名人やインフルエンサー、自分の尊敬する人から直接もらったモノってNFTでなくても嬉しいですよね。そういうことです。\n    Giveawayを通して配布していくのも良いと思います。\n\n[https://twitter.com/rain_vc/status/1443612208408137730](https://twitter.com/rain_vc/status/1443612208408137730)\n\n*   [ ]  ターゲットは日本人？NFTインベスター？それによって販売する通貨が変わる\n    日本人のCryptoアーティストであれば日本人に売りたくなるところですが、日本人にNFTを訴求して買ってくれる人はまだいません。日本人に対して販売しようとするとJPYでクレカ決済と思考が行きがちですが、それではNFTインベスターが購入できず価格は上がりません。\n\n    日本と海外のNFT単価は0が１つ違う印象を受けるので、NFTを高く売りたいのであれば海外のNFT系インフルエンサーが好きそうなNFTを販売する必要があります。そのためはここでせ説明しているような要素が必要です。\n\n*   [ ]  流動性を高く保つことができるか\n    NFTは資産性を持つので売買することで稼ぐことができます。NFTの価値を高めるためにはこの流動性が非常に重要で特に重要なのが「Floor Price：最低購入価格」と「Volume Traded：総流通金額」です。\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hideaki-97c59.appspot.com/o/images%2FlHn2Bn5im1Zex0k1pQyMp0W8eJn2%2FsA4-hl13A.png?alt=media)\n\n一度購入したアートには愛着が湧くのでコレクターがアートを持ち続けたい気持ちになるのはわかりますが、アーティストを応援する気持ちがあるのであればアートを購入した価格よりも高く売る必要があります。アートを高く販売することでCryptoアーティストの価値が高まり他のNFTアートの価値も高まっていきます。\n\n特にコレクティブル系のNFTはこの流動性が重要でPriceが高まることが人を呼び込む最も効果的なニュースとなるのでファンの数も増えていきます。\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hideaki-97c59.appspot.com/o/images%2FlHn2Bn5im1Zex0k1pQyMp0W8eJn2%2FlMxaFx8ZC.png?alt=media)\n\nNFTアートを１つしか持っていないと、売りづらいのでロイヤルなコレクターにはNFTは2個買ってもらうような施策を展開すると良いと思います。\n\n*   [ ]  コミュニティを運用することができるか\n    NFTはP２P取引を行うブロックチェーンを基盤にした技術なので、アーティストとコレクターの距離が近くなります。また、NFTを持っていることを証明できるので、NFTを持っている者同士が類友として繋がりコミュニティを作ります。\n    [[Daily Topics]NFTが類友発見装置となり、コミュニティが形成され、さらにおもしろい施策が生まれる構造について](https://www.notion.so/Daily-Topics-NFT-0ae9f02cbf144fa4a83a356fb908ae8c)\n    ファンクラブに友達と入るとやめにくくなるように、コミュニティ内の類友同士の繋がりが強固に慣ればなるほど強いコミュニティになります。このコミュニティの中でコレクターたちが求める需要のヒアリングを行いつつNFTの使いみちを増やしていく事を検討するのが良いと思っているので、まずはご自身のDiscordを開いてみることをおすすめします。\n\n考えられうる限りの方法論について書きました。自分が観測している限りの事を書きなぐってしまいましたが、その他の観点があれば追記して内容をさらに充実させていきたいと思いますのでコメントくださいませ。\n\n## 企業ではCryptoアーティストの支援は難しい\n\nここで書いたような施策は中央集権的な組織には難しいんじゃないの？というのが個人的な感想です。これらのCryptoアーティスト支援事業を始める企業などが多いと思いますが、事業者であれば自社のサービスの利用させるインセンティブがありアーティストの特性や流行りを無視した提案になる可能性があります。\n少なくとも、アート性の強いNFTアートを販売することを考えるのであれば、まず日本のマーケットプレイスでの販売は考えないでしょう。アートに強い海外のマケプレに出品するほうが懸命です。\n\nこういう事を考えると、中央集権的な企業でCryptoアーティスト支援事業を行うよりもDAO的な組織で支援事業を立ち上げ売上をDAOのTreasury（共同金庫）に貯めていくほうが最適な選択ができるのではと思った次第です。いかがでしょうか。\n\n[https://twitter.com/nobu_mei/status/1443991697784930307](https://twitter.com/nobu_mei/status/1443991697784930307)\n\nDAO的にCryptoアーティストがお互いにアドバイスし合う環境が最も理想の環境なのかなと思いますので、試しにDiscordにてチャンネルを作ってみました。試しにやってみたいと思いますので、手伝ってくれるCryptoアーティストがいらっしゃいましたら一緒にやり取りしてみてください。どうぞよろしくお願いいたします。\n\n## NFTの販売方法に正解はない\n\n上述にて、NFTの販売方法についてつらつらと書きましたが、これは現時点でのやり方でありすべてでは無いと思います。私自身がCryptoアーティストとしてNFTを販売しているわけではないので、あくまで界隈を観測している範囲でアドバイスできる内容になっています。\n\nもっと細かいノウハウがあると思いますので、実際にNFTを販売している方々、「こんな方法もあるよ」があれば教えていただければと思います。\n\nあと、具体的な事例を見ていくのも良いと思います。\n\n[なぜ「猿の絵」が2.5億円で売れるNFTになったのか

It was like she was a “probie” of a Strasse-crew, waiting for a chance to throw back some hits and kicks, and make points with bosses.\n\n”I’m coming Mama, I just have to get the last of this gear on.”\n\nFernanda made sure the last of the service issue fatigues configured themselves to her body. Standard issue nanos and algos ran boot-up routines and the suit molded itself to her and became a second skin. She was the image of Mars Infantry.\n\nA slight pinching was the most she felt as the start-up procudure integrated her body and parts of her cortex to her unit’s “stack”. She was in now. No going back. The pinching ended, suit done.\n\n“Come sit down, ingermica, sit. No telling when you eat again.”\n\n”Yes Mama.” \n\nFernanda thought about the breakfast she already had with her ‘crew’ down by the shipyards, her “farewell feast” and her instructions to her number 2. With luck, they wouldn’t mess it up, her trusty would make sure her Mama would be looked after, and nobody from other crews would even scan their business. \n\nWhen this Long War was over, she could come out of hiding, stop playing “soldier”, and get back to business at the ‘yards.\n\n“I made your favorites, Ingermica. No telling what kind of half-Earther food they feed you.” Her mother hid her worry. \n\n”Oh this food smells so good.” Fernanda wasn’t hungry but she ate everything. \n\nMama was right, no telling when exactly she would eat home food. The Long War might be going short but no telling.\n\n**1987 EARTH**\n\nFor a long time the financial markets were in the dumps, until 1982.\n\nSure, there was the “Roaring 20s” and “Go Go” 60s, but there was also the Depression, WW II, a Cold War that got hot in Asia (twice), and the 1970s malaise of post-Vietnam, OPEC and stagflation.\n\nThe best & brightest avoided “Wall Street” but time erased past sins. Memories shortened. White shoe firms grew grey hairs, and a new breed was taking over. Their love language were big deals. \n\nThe Big 80s included mergers, “hostile takeovers”, and lots of debt. Tax policies made deals “doable” with interest deductions. But bankers had to “raise debt” in the first place. Interest rates and USD were higher, the market drifted lower a little bit by September, and worries were rising on the “Street”. \n\nDan Rostenkowski, chair of the House Ways & Means Committee, looked at cutting deals’ tax-breaks. The worries were piling up. \n\nThe “bulls” ran for 5 years - the “Dow Jones” had tripled. Funds wanted to lock in profits in case. “Portfolio Insurance” was the answer. Brokers could “short” the S&P 500 index through computer programs, at the first sign of trouble. \n\nMachines would take over.\n\nBy mid-October 1987, “Mr. Market” was getting nervous. The week ended with no word about this new tax change. Selling picked up. A new Fed Chairman, Greenspan, cut rates but it was too late.\n\nThe Asian markets got nervous over the weekend. Monday morning, panic mood became panic selling. The mutual funds had to honor redemptions. Then came “portfolio insurance” shorting the market. The “Dow” dropped 23% on Monday, Oct. 19, 1987.\n\nNext day, the Fed pulled some strings but the machines stayed.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eU9RNkycbXfROm3hvk_CB.png?height=1600&width=1200)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Pqpd2da4Zbp8qu5-9aWWC.png?height=1600&width=1200)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633753567, "digest": "mersKrQzHt5jkDqdoww0XU6IrlChTNwxtpHRNb_7_X0", "contributor": "0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f"}

When these DApps were built on their own customized chains, communication became a problem. This means the autonomy characteristic of blockchain becomes the biggest obstacle. The problem of decentralizing safely and effectively has bothered the Cross-chain transmission of messages developers for a very long time.\n\n## 👀 What is IBC\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*C-oyrSBRquuhRG-I.png)\n\n[IBC（inter-blockchain communication protocol）](https://ibcprotocol.org/)is a general cross-chain information transmission protocol introduced by [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/). While ensuring the autonomy of each chain and the speed of transaction processing, IBC makes information and assets across the chain more decentralized, safe, and convenient. More than 200 services and applications and more than $80 billion of investments have adopted IBC. IBC is like TCP/IP protocol of the blockchain world, making blockchain networks possible.\n\nWith the help of IBC, blockchains adopting various consensus mechanisms can communicate with each other, as long as their consensus mechanisms meet the so-called “Fast Finality”, where all transactions can be quickly packaged and cannot be revoked or changed.\n\nSince bitcoin and Ethereum don’t fully meet the requirements from such “Fast Finality”, Cosmos customizes inter-blockchain solutions for them: two customized blockchains supporting “Fast Finality” and IBC track the status of bitcoin and Ethereum respectively. Since these two customized chains are compatible with IBC and hold the latest knowledge of bitcoin and Ethereum, now any chains can communicate with Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\n## 🌰 IBC: An Example\n\nNext, let’s use [an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmytpuD33lY&ab_channel=Cosmos) to explain how IBC works. Suppose we have two blockchains using IBC, called Earth and Mars. We want to send a “Hello world” from Earth to Mars. We first need to run a so-called “Relayer” for the message delivery. The relayer continuously checks the state of the chain and creates a transaction on another chain that contains the corresponding message. In the case of using IBC, a lite client of Mars will run on Earth so that Earth can verify the status of Mars and ensure that the information transmitted by Relayer is effective and accurate. Similarly, Mars will run a client of Earth.\n\nSame as TCP/IP, the two chains first will do a “handshake” for identity authentication to prepare for secure message transmission. We then only need to create the corresponding “Hello world” message on Earth, and Relayer will transmit it to Mars. IBC ensures the security of data transmission, which is followed by triggering onAck, onTimedout, as well as other events.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*0RMCR7QdlktrUfo3.png)\n\nNotice that IBC is only responsible for secure data transmission. For data serialization, it needs to be processed by applications built on the blockchain.\n\n## 🌌 Cosmos IBC\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*Lg1NPwHvrVMbJiIQ.jpeg)\n\nIBC is a protocol that has been implemented in Cosmos-SDK. It may support Kepler, Substrate, Tendermint, Codechain in the future.\n\nCosmos is furthering the influence of Cosmos-SDK through IBC, but it is not the only player developing inter-blockchain and customized blockchain technologies.

{"id": "DMvaOvGlCWsfNPSKpY-ASlL8b-B0MDa5iyYQDqAmmP4", "title": "Hubbard model\n", "body": "The **Hubbard model** is an approximate model used, especially in [solid-state physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_physics), to describe the transition between [conducting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductor_(material)) and [insulating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_insulation).[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubbard_model#cite_note-Altland-1) The Hubbard model, named after [John Hubbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hubbard_(physicist)), is a simple model of interacting particles in a lattice, with only two terms in the [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)) (see example below): a kinetic term allowing for [tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunneling) (\"hopping\") of particles between sites of the lattice and a potential term consisting of an on-site interaction. The particles can either be [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermions), as in Hubbard's original work, or [bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosons), in which case the model is referred to as the \"[Bose–Hubbard model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Hubbard_model)\".\n\nThe Hubbard model is a useful approximation for particles in a periodic potential at sufficiently low temperatures, where all the particles may be assumed to be in the lowest [Bloch band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch%27s_theorem), and long-range interactions between the particles can be ignored. If interactions between particles at different sites of the lattice are included, the model is often referred to as the \"extended Hubbard model\". In particular, the Hubbard term, most commonly denoted by *U*, is applied in first principles based simulations using [Density Functional Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_Functional_Theory), DFT. The inclusion of the Hubbard term in DFT simulations is important as this improves the prediction of electron localisation and thus it prevents the incorrect prediction of metallic conduction in insulating systems.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubbard_model#cite_note-2) The model was originally proposed in 1963 to describe electrons in solids.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubbard_model#cite_note-3) Since then, it has been applied to the study of [high-temperature superconductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-temperature_superconductivity), quantum magnetism, and charge density waves.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubbard_model#cite_note-4) The Hubbard model introduces short-range interactions between electrons to the [tight-binding model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_binding), which only includes kinetic energy (a \"hopping\" term) and interactions with the atoms of the lattice (an \"atomic\" potential). When the interaction between electrons is strong, the behavior of the Hubbard model can be qualitatively different from a tight-binding model. For example, the Hubbard model correctly predicts the existence of [Mott insulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mott_insulator): materials that are insulating due to the strong repulsion between electrons, even though they satisfy the usual criteria for conductors, such as having an odd number of electrons per unit cell.", "timestamp": 1633755038, "digest": "iE5lg9SpIl5adeGFqTslyCMvEc9rFZbH1A0-7PF_57k", "contributor": "0x7033D86B9f861600f41cA38fd39b8894F8430f19"}

We received no notification, e-mail or information at all from OpenSea as to what happened. We sent multiple support tickets, reached out in their Discord server, and finally got some answers after utilizing our collective networks to get a hold of someone there.\n\n**Why did they de-list the NFTs?**\n\nSince land tokenization is central to our DAO and these NFTs would give access to land drops they believe the NFTs went against their terms. They explained its because OpenSea doesn't allow listing real estate. Our NFTs are not real estate but they don’t want to support anything that could be related.\n\n[OpenSea experienced controversy](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58585342) in September with an insider trading situation. They are likely highly risk-averse right now.\n\n### 🗞 What’s next? Solution: create independent smart contract (in development)\n\n1. The new one will be ERC721 and 100% independent of any exchange. Minting will be done through our site.\n2. Once ready, previous NFTs can be exchanged 1:1 with the new ones at any time, and they have the same rights/value.\n\n### 🗞 When will Citizen NFTs be available again?\n\nTimeline TBD but we anticipate it being in the near-future. Please reach out if you have any questions or have experience in this space.

More updates will come for Citizens shortly as negotiations proceed\n\ntheir top execs are aware of it and should get back to us soon. Regardless, we are in parallel working on our own, independent way to buy and trade the citizen nfts.\n\nfeels like a historic moment, reading it now!\n\nHow do i get citizenship?\n\nThis is awesome. You guys have obviously been kicking ass. I've not been checking in and here you got your land already!\n\nI am experienced in Computer Vision and have recently been using Drones for mapping and training CV models to detect objects from the air.\n\nI cannot wait for property and realspace assets are on the blockchain.\n\nhave heard quite a lot of people discussing citydao lately and wanted to hop in and say hello\n\njust to discuss, casually, perhaps over dinner and not during official hours, about possibly changes in the land registration process\n\nHey all, I haven't been around for a couple months, but I wanted to say I'm blown away with all the progress that's been made!\n\nI've been doing some research into water rights in Wyoming. Here's a summary of the laws in a government memo, but it's from 2001 (and it looks like the source document could be even older)\n\nThis is one of the most interesting projects I've ever seen in crypto, not just in NFT. I'm waiting for the bar results right now, but if all goes well i'll be a cryptolawyer soon!\n\nbuying one parcel as a DAO is our first step, and allowing members to own a piece of that parcel. the city aspect comes as more people start building on the land and we deal with questions like what is allowed to be built and funding public goods.\n\nThe land is in Wyoming. It's very rural - 40 minutes north west of Cody, Wyoming\n\nout of curiosity, are they referring to this CityDAO or maybe they're just referring to CityDAOs in a general sense?\n\nCommunity Call happening now - we will go over the land parcels and DAO citizens will share the reasons they like or dislike each parcel. Will be a fun time, see ya soon!\n\nFormer commercial real estate finance underwriting pro (mostly CMBS type stuff, some CDOs) based in Brooklyn.\n\nuseless observation -- \"Kirschbaum\" (current owner?) means \"Cherry Tree\"\n\nI'd also say there's another layer of deeper questions being asked here beyond just streamlining ownership and revenue generation\n\nHey all, love what you’re doing. Awesome to see the beginnings of on chain land ownership.\n\nI am a commercial property developer from South Africa.\n\nInteresting documents on Well water quality and Disclosures from the broker today on Parcel 6\n\nExcited to give what I can to this community and hopefully build the future of cities with you all!\n\nI'm a software engineer, working on building 5G networks. Outside of that, I host The Urban Loop podcast where I talk to technologists and city leaders about building the Smart Cities of the future\n\nLast chance to vote on the land parcel!\n\nthey gave us no explanation, but it was shortly after i requested verification for the collection. i think its because our project is tokenizing real assets\n\nWhat's good citiziens of citydao, my friend just turned me on to this.

{"id": "VT4Va3snmOynpBHVtniElUZvz1rzTJw8w7nLrnnjO_s", "title": "DEGEN: The Robotic Powerhouse That Automates Backend Processes for Your DAO", "body": "> “You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.” —R. Buckminster Fuller\n\nThis whole post is about DEGEN, a robotic powerhouse that automates backend processes for your DAO. DEGEN can listen in during your events and automatically deliver POAPS to attendees. DEGEN can create and deliver bounties for asynchronous freelance collaboration. And soon, DEGEN will be able to help you squad up and scope out entire projects. However, before we dive deeper to learn the potential behind DEGEN, we should have a little chat about the thought that underlies DEGEN, and its journey to inception. So, let us palaver, shall we?\n\nOne term that gets thrown around a lot in the cryptosphere is “degenerate.” The term degenerate suggests a decline. And maybe in the beginning, this is what was meant, as individuals came together to explore the space that was opening up as a result of the growing popularity of Bitcoin and Ethereum. But just as [Elizabeth Warren](https://twitter.com/SenWarren)’s description of crypto developers as “[some shadowy, faceless group of super-coders and miners](https://decrypt.co/76997/elizabeth-warren-crypto-big-banks-shadowy-super-coders?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=auto)” was adopted by said developers as a fun, new moniker to wear with pride, “degenerate” has become a term of endearment and affection for those of us pressing forward on the frontier of cryptocurrency. We’re all just a bunch of degenerates—or degens, for short—shirking suits and ties and legal names, choosing to identify ourselves with Profile Picture Non-Fungible Tokens and creative monikers instead. We don’t exist in the mainstream. We don’t accept what’s socially acceptable. We denounce cultural norms.\n\nWe are far more concerned about doing whatever the fuck we want.\n\nBut those of us who are labeled as degenerates, those of us who are unwilling to live in the miserable spaces created by cultural norms, we’re willing to step out and do something different. With the courage to step out, we have the freedom to build systems that will turn existing systems on their heads. We’re willing to do the work that will benefit everyone, even those who refuse to acknowledge they’re locked in a system that doesn’t serve them.\n\nWe’re here to build a better world. For everyone.\n\nNotable degenerates across history include Joan of Arc, Nelson Mandela, the Wright Brothers, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Edward Snowden. These degens were unwilling to accept the world as it was and worked tirelessly to change it.\n\nAnd they did. They did it for everyone.\n\nDegenerates will build and do degenerate things, and degenerate things tend to change the course of history. DEGEN is a degenerate thing built for the purpose of arming Degeneratively Active Opportunities—or, rather, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations—with the tools they need to help automate backend organizational practices, so they can focus on doing what they do best: build systems that will change the world.\n\nDEGEN was borne out of a need to automate basic administrative tasks and open gateways to improved Web3 systems within Discord. In the early days of BanklessDAO, there was recognition of a need in easing the organizational efforts of the core admin team, and so began the development of something that would do exactly that. With the combined efforts of [brianpatino.eth](https://twitter.com/BrianPatino_ETH), [duke.eth](https://twitter.com/duke_eth), and myself, [nonsensetwice](https://twitter.com/nonsensecodes), DEGEN was given life.\n\nAs the DAO evolved, structures and services were implemented to better serve existing DAO members and provide ways for new members to become involved and earn their place within the DAO. As these structures developed, DEGEN developed alongside to automate and manage some of them. As labor management became unwieldy in BanklessDAO, DEGEN became a cornerstone partner in the powerful [Bounty Board project](https://banklessdao.mirror.xyz/sie3cTas4AaZ0xzRuAYIUvOyTBLqQ_ABOxVLJ_osJ2U), allowing for greater autonomy in creating and finding work for anyone looking to make some BANK.\n\n![A subset of commands available to run the Bounty Board within Discord](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8U-cgdvBVXPg_t8Deb1N9.jpg?height=513&width=1748)\n\nFurthermore, in terms of contribution, a new feature is currently in development that will provide members the ability to scope out a project and find others who share their vision. Coupled with the Bounty Board, this will be a powerful set of tools to empower members to contribute in whatever way they choose: Bounty Board for the freelance-minded, Scope Squad for the project-minded.\n\nHowever, what’s drawing most of the attention to DEGEN is its POAP distribution feature. This substantially simplifies the process of ensuring event attendees receive their POAPs in a timely manner. There is no need to get creative in obfuscating the password so only attendees can claim POAPs. Using the `/poap schedule` command, you can upload your POAP art and send in the information for your event and mint your claim links. Using the `/poap start` command, you can set DEGEN to listen in on an event, whether it’s in a standard voice channel or on a stage, and record the attendees. And upon using the `/poap end` command, DEGEN will ask for the claim links and proceed to distribute them to all active attendees.\n\n“I made a list. Give me your list and I’ll use both lists to deliver the POAPs.”\n\nThank you, DEGEN.\n\n> “Hello, nonsensetwice!”\n\n![The currently available set of POAP Distribution commands](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q8FCbY5DNNDka1TespOFc.jpg?height=495&width=1732)\n\nWorking in this manner, many pain points in POAP distribution are solved to some extent. No more password phishing in channels. No more stealing claim links from spreadsheets. It’s a simple implementation of a better system that enables event organizers to feel more confident about distributing POAPs to legitimate attendees.\n\nThe POAP distribution feature is pretty cool, but pales in comparison by what else is on offer. Even better, we’re offering to help other Discord communities in the Web3 space—DAOs, NFT communities, crypto protocols—to get setup with DEGEN. As more communities pick up DEGEN for the POAP distribution feature, they’ll come to recognize the power and value of features like the Bounty Board and upcoming Scope Squad. Eventually, DEGEN will be seen as *THE* de facto Discord DAO tool, bringing Web3 functionality to Discord in a way that hasn’t been explored before. Gnosis implementation is coming soon to DEGEN. And with Gnosis, many other features will be possible. A tipping mechanism is in the works. Blockchain-agnostic services are in the works. There is no ceiling on the potential of what DEGEN will become capable of, in the same way there is no ceiling on the potential for what every community in this space can create.\n\nThe BanklessDAO mission is to onboard 1 billion people into crypto, and it is our belief on the DEGEN team that we align with this mission best by automating and simplifying tedious and complex tasks, thus facilitating and empowering DAOs and cryptocurrency protocols to do what they do best: build a better and more sustainable culture that will attract users to this space. If you are interested in bringing DEGEN to your community, or if you think your community will benefit from what DEGEN has to offer, [please take a moment to fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScgy2XMXmyneNUsoJt_y3PW5sUutv3IcElMHzk-CCAmImiwQQ/viewform).

News & Updates\n3. Shoutouts & Showcases\n4. Overheard in CityDAO\n5. DAO industry news\n6. Memes to go\n\n\n---\n\n### What is CityDAO?\n\nThe CityDAO community is made up of ambitious and HIGHLY curious people exploring and building at the frontier of technology, governance and physical land.\n\nThe vision of CityDAO is to build the city of the future on the Ethereum blockchain by tokenizing land, rights, and governance.\n\n## 🔈CityDAO so far\n\nFirst, let’s do a quick recap of the CityDAO adventure so far:\n\n**Month 1: July - laying the groundwork**\n\n* **July 1** - DAOs can legally be recognized as an LLC in Wyoming\n* **July 2** - CityDAO starts (Scott’s infamous tweet)\n* **July 7** - First community call\n* **July 15** - CityDAO Discord membership crosses 1000 people\n* **July 23** - CityDAO officially registered as an LLC in Wyoming\n* **July 28** - CityDAO gets voted in on Mirror’s $WRITE RACE\n\n**Month 2: August - bolstering the treasury**\n\n* **August 8** - The First Citizen NFT sells for 6.52 ETH\n* **August 11** - Release Founding Citizen NFTs\n* **August 12** - CityDAO treasury passes $30k\n* **August 20** - CityDAO treasury passes $100k\n* **August 25** - Founding Citizen NFT sells for 10 ETH live in a community call\n* **August 25** - CityDAO treasury passes $250k\n* **August 26** - Connect w/ real estate agent in Wyoming to help with land purchase\n\n**Month 3: September - voting on land acquisition**\n\n* **September 08** - CityDAO forum is added to aid governance discussions\n* **September 15** - Dev & Design team demo the parcel viewer\n* **September 21** - CityDAO citizens vote on first parcel purchase\n* **September 27** - Citizens vote to make offer on “Parcel 6” (40 acres)\n* **September 28** - CityDAO makes an offer on real land\n* **September 28** - Offer accepted, land purchase process begins\n\n### Live footage of CityDAO going from tweet to citizens voting on putting an offer on 40 acres of real Wyoming land…in 3 months 😂 :\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vKOY51NA2DwmZbQoll1rV.gif?height=400&width=480)\n\n\n---\n\n# 🔈News & Updates\n\n# 🗞 Annnnd our DAO has officially purchased land! 🎊\n\n![WAGMI vibes right here](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FmbW8L0eDN3hh_cUBjUlE.png?height=702&width=1043)\n\n![CityDAO flag going up on the land](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/H-C4tGhmdYUCcJalTF-H5.png?height=1398&width=1054)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k2kW3fYZebFAqQJTUNbuz.png?height=197&width=375)\n\n### 🗞 OpenSea de-listed CityDAO\n\n[https://twitter.com/chadfowler/status/1444365420388044806?s=20](https://twitter.com/chadfowler/status/1444365420388044806?s=20)\n\n**What happened?**\n\nWe found out the NFTs were de-listed from new members asking why they couldn’t buy a Citizen NFT. We received no notification, e-mail or information at all from OpenSea as to what happened. We sent multiple support tickets, reached out in their Discord server, and finally got some answers after utilizing our collective networks to get a hold of someone there.\n\n**Why did they de-list the NFTs?**\n\nSince land tokenization is central to our DAO and these NFTs would give access to land drops they believe the NFTs went against their terms. They explained its because OpenSea doesn't allow listing real estate. Our NFTs are not real estate but they don’t want to support anything that could be related.\n\n[OpenSea experienced controversy](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58585342) in September with an insider trading situation. They are likely highly risk-averse right now.\n\n### 🗞 What’s next? Solution: create independent smart contract (in development)\n\n1. The new one will be ERC721 and 100% independent of any exchange. Minting will be done through our site.\n2. Once ready, previous NFTs can be exchanged 1:1 with the new ones at any time, and they have the same rights/value.\n\n### 🗞 When will Citizen NFTs be available again?\n\nTimeline TBD but we anticipate it being in the near-future. Please reach out if you have any questions or have experience in this space. We’ll post in #announcements once we have updates.\n\n### 🗞 Parcel Viewer - here’s a glimpse of the CityDAO parcel explorer! @Greg, @Bpetes, @odyslam and @scott have been on fire with this one 🔥\n\n> A web app to view & trade CityDAO land parcels\n\n[Here’s a link to a 45 second Loom for a better view](https://www.loom.com/share/a9adac738b2d4003a12ad3359e26f846).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/snbdoc4j5qWBAm4A4Kf5O.gif?height=270&width=480)\n\n### 🗞 So… Balaji’s call-to-action sounds fun.

Indeed, it seems that's nearly impossible to build on some places, especially the southwest part.

More updates will come for Citizens shortly as negotiations proceed\n\ntheir top execs are aware of it and should get back to us soon. Regardless, we are in parallel working on our own, independent way to buy and trade the citizen nfts.\n\nfeels like a historic moment, reading it now!\n\nHow do i get citizenship?\n\nThis is awesome. You guys have obviously been kicking ass. I've not been checking in and here you got your land already!\n\nI am experienced in Computer Vision and have recently been using Drones for mapping and training CV models to detect objects from the air.\n\nI cannot wait for property and realspace assets are on the blockchain.\n\nhave heard quite a lot of people discussing citydao lately and wanted to hop in and say hello\n\njust to discuss, casually, perhaps over dinner and not during official hours, about possibly changes in the land registration process\n\nHey all, I haven't been around for a couple months, but I wanted to say I'm blown away with all the progress that's been made!\n\nI've been doing some research into water rights in Wyoming. Here's a summary of the laws in a government memo, but it's from 2001 (and it looks like the source document could be even older)\n\nThis is one of the most interesting projects I've ever seen in crypto, not just in NFT. I'm waiting for the bar results right now, but if all goes well i'll be a cryptolawyer soon!\n\nbuying one parcel as a DAO is our first step, and allowing members to own a piece of that parcel. the city aspect comes as more people start building on the land and we deal with questions like what is allowed to be built and funding public goods.\n\nThe land is in Wyoming. It's very rural - 40 minutes north west of Cody, Wyoming\n\nout of curiosity, are they referring to this CityDAO or maybe they're just referring to CityDAOs in a general sense?\n\nCommunity Call happening now - we will go over the land parcels and DAO citizens will share the reasons they like or dislike each parcel. Will be a fun time, see ya soon!\n\nFormer commercial real estate finance underwriting pro (mostly CMBS type stuff, some CDOs) based in Brooklyn.\n\nuseless observation -- \"Kirschbaum\" (current owner?) means \"Cherry Tree\"\n\nI'd also say there's another layer of deeper questions being asked here beyond just streamlining ownership and revenue generation\n\nHey all, love what you’re doing. Awesome to see the beginnings of on chain land ownership.\n\nI am a commercial property developer from South Africa.\n\nInteresting documents on Well water quality and Disclosures from the broker today on Parcel 6\n\nExcited to give what I can to this community and hopefully build the future of cities with you all!\n\nI'm a software engineer, working on building 5G networks. Outside of that, I host The Urban Loop podcast where I talk to technologists and city leaders about building the Smart Cities of the future\n\nLast chance to vote on the land parcel!\n\nthey gave us no explanation, but it was shortly after i requested verification for the collection. i think its because our project is tokenizing real assets\n\nWhat's good citiziens of citydao, my friend just turned me on to this. Just came back from Wyoming on a massive 4,500 mile roadtrip\n\n## 🐦 Some recent tweets we love\n\n[https://twitter.com/CroissantEth/status/1443971953187069955?s=20](https://twitter.com/CroissantEth/status/1443971953187069955?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/nichanank/status/1438205060777865218?s=20](https://twitter.com/nichanank/status/1438205060777865218?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/anotherjohnbeck/status/1439325370742833152?s=20](https://twitter.com/anotherjohnbeck/status/1439325370742833152?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/gid3xn/status/1442249426668376066?s=20](https://twitter.com/gid3xn/status/1442249426668376066?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/spaghettiNFT/status/1443493722474221574?s=20](https://twitter.com/spaghettiNFT/status/1443493722474221574?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/BoredElonMusk/status/1446316443247595520?s=20](https://twitter.com/BoredElonMusk/status/1446316443247595520?s=20)\n\n\n---\n\n# ☕️ Resources shared in CityDAO\n\n[https://twitter.com/theindiedao/status/1445410822134501386?s=20](https://twitter.com/theindiedao/status/1445410822134501386?s=20)\n\n## 🎨 Meme to go\n\n**H/T to @Greg for this spicy meme 🌶**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g-6lBZ_pPFp_J5akUZtiw.png?height=992&width=898)\n\n**H/T to @Justin Kalland**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1mBD6wn2XjIHzlLImsu2X.png?height=500&width=750)\n\n### Past CityDAO Roundups\n\n[https://chance.ghost.io/citydao-community-roundup-vol-1-so-it-begins/](https://chance.ghost.io/citydao-community-roundup-vol-1-so-it-begins/)\n\n[https://city.mirror.xyz/jTi0-xQOMadDgvP_KgMOoHZaYvWJY6D7YK4bcdFz-f4](https://city.mirror.xyz/jTi0-xQOMadDgvP_KgMOoHZaYvWJY6D7YK4bcdFz-f4)\n\n[https://city.mirror.xyz/4t6MRC8re_vTuJiVqkKmJTPXBpurzwb1N3v8S6bSJJs](https://city.mirror.xyz/4t6MRC8re_vTuJiVqkKmJTPXBpurzwb1N3v8S6bSJJs)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633755758, "digest": "1HoGdPHJ4NBmLW_sEun299_QiZTl5WHQAZfa9G8J8NY", "contributor": "0x77aA943A365161e499eaFF59E936a799e6051e15"}

No me refiero a esa abogacía negocio que pone en el beneficio económico su primer objetivo, la que deja ver sus ecos de sociedad en las páginas de la prensa salmón, la que a menudo no es más que una herramienta más de los poderosos para tratar de adecuar la realidad jurídica a su conveniencia. Bufetes de influencias, de consejos de administración en multinacionales, condenas por delito fiscal, fondos buitre y trust en las Caimán.\n\nA la que me refiero es a esa abogacía que defiende los derechos de los ciudadanos anteponiéndolos a los propios, a esa que, cuando usted le pregunta aquello de «si hay pleito» le responde con la verdad y le dice lo que más le conviene a usted y no a su cuenta corriente. Siglos de ejercicio profesional construyeron esa abogacía que ahora, en beneficio de los intereses de unos pocos miserables, se trata de destruir.\n\nSe la destruye cuando se eliminan las costas en los procesos hipotecarios, porque con ello se obstaculiza la reclamación de los ciudadanos y se premia la miserable, inhumana y sucia codicia de los bancos.\n\nSe la destruye cuando se aleja la justicia de los juzgados naturales de los consumidores para llevarlos lejos, hacer más caro su acceso y atascar su funcionamiento sin más motivo que favorecer a los de siempre.\n\nSe la destruye cuando se favorece a los bancos reduciendo los lugares en los que pueden ser demandados ellos apenas a 52 juzgados mientras que ellos ejecutan y embargan en los 433 partidos judiciales de España.\n\nSe la destruye cuando a los ciudadanos se les imponen automáticamente las costas de las ejecuciones como si ser pobre fue lo mismo que ser temerario o no poder pagar fue lo mismo que actuar de mala fe, mientras que medio país —incluido el Consejo General de la Abogacía Española— trata de que ellos, los bancos, no paguen costas más que en contados casos de conjunciones planetarias.\n\nSe ataca a esta abogacía cuando se atacan muy discriminadamente los criterios de honorarios de los colegios, cobrándoselos con saña a los deudores hipotecarios o bancarios pero interponiendo demandas millonarias contra los colegios cuando son ellos quienes han de atenerse a una más que atemperada versión de los mismos .\n\nSe ataca a esta abogacía cuando no se prorrogan o suspenden los plazos en caso de enfermedad, maternidad o paternidad y se pretende que los abogados y abogadas sean material fungible.\n\nSe la ataca cuando se reconoce el derecho a litigar gratuitamente a capas de la sociedad pero no se dota a la justicia gratuita del presupuesto suficiente para que esa defensa esté dignamente retribuida.\n\nSe la ataca cuando no se controla la publicidad engañosa de empresas que pretenden ser despachos de abogados cuando no son más que intermediarios o multinacionales de procesar carne de jurista novel.\n\nPero el mayor peligro que amenaza a esta abogacía somos nosotros mismos que, obcecados en defender la justicia, no nos demos cuenta de que la mejor manera de defender los derechos de la ciudadanía es defender la existencia de la abogacía que hace posibles esos derechos, la abogacía que hace que la constitución y el resto del ordenamiento no sean para ellos papel mojado.\n\nNo, en las sociedades sin una abogacía así los derechos de la ciudadanía no son más que pura retórica y es por eso que, antes que nada o al mismo tiempo que todo, nuestro deber es defender esta abogacía necesaria.", "timestamp": 1633759890, "digest": "PFhkZWUBgaVvtdxR30xZcM2H8XgTMlN3hGvOsUpU80k", "contributor": "0xb5bF77b790f8185a6968F0B26f7Ff2610c1aAe42"}

{"id": "0SLfYIanD-fUTZmJKjTRS7gRkV_QTpkV1byHz0lyyLI", "title": "Mirror.xyz 产品初体验：通向 Web3 内容创作的一道窄门", "body": "链闻曾在今年年初，Mirror.xyz 产品发布后不久，[撰文介绍](https://www.chainnews.com/articles/859231688546.htm) 过这个新型内容创作平台的雏形。经过近一年发展，Mirror 的功能和体验不断完善，在本月初向所有用户开放了写作功能，Mirror 还为创作者提供了众筹和投票等基础能力。现在，是时候体验下这些功能了。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VajI9C_KXcq4jU0geBrww.png?height=534&width=960)\n\n简单理解，Mirror 是一个采用区块链技术的内容创作平台，普遍认为它是去中心化版本的 medium。\n\n我个人更喜欢 Mirror 一篇文章中对它自身的定位：\n\n**What is Mirror = Who’s on Mirror**\n\n从这个定义来看，Mirror 不仅仅是一个去中心的内容创作工具，它更像是一个社区协作平台。\n\n我们先来看下目前 Mirror 能做什么：\n\n### Mirror 提供的能力\n\n当前阶段，Mirror 为创作者提供了 6 个基础能力工具，包括**发布文章**（Entries）、**众筹**（Crowdfunds）、**数字藏品**（Editions）、**拍卖**（Auctions）、**合作贡献分流**（Splits）、**社区投票**（Token Race）。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IKc1_jcoQaWVwxckzdFvU.png?height=395&width=960)\n\n当前阶段，Mirror 的发布文章能力已经面向所有人开放，访问 [这里](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/entries)，即可开始在线发布。\n\nMirror 支持文章的一键导入功能，可以将自己在其他平台发布的文章通过链接方式一键导入。（亲测公众号不行，被屏蔽了）\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cqAoAmTwYi0UppoE0jtGd.png?height=400&width=960)\n\nMirror 的在线编辑器采用纯文本+Markdown 的格式，同时支持内部构建块的快速引用。\n\n最大的亮点是每一个 Mirror 的功能块都可以在文章中快速引用，并提供直接预览。比如众筹和 NFT 功能，直接在文章中就可以完成购买操作。\n\n文章编辑功能的详细操作可参考 [官方手册](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/editor)。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T8Fmsyr7bqketH9u1CBNw.png?height=332&width=960)\n\n在发布文章页面的右上角，可以设置文章的发布形式。勾选 NFT 选项，文章会作为数字藏品发布，读者可以购买该文章作为收藏。\n\n点击齿轮可以选择是否将文章发布到链上，public 即是将文章发布到 Arweave 分布式存储区块链上。（需要缴纳较高的网络费）\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NNiQwaP7t1bw-hzHz5tbA.png?height=205&width=960)\n\n对于每一个发布到链上的文章，在文章最下方会看到链上存储的唯一地址。可以实现文章的完全的去中心化访问。\n\n#### 众筹（Crowdfunds）\n\n像传统的众筹平台一样，Mirror 的众筹功能允许为项目或创意筹集资金。与传统的众筹平台不同，Mirror 的优势在于可以快速启动一个 DAO。\n\nMirror 众筹亮点主要包括：\n\n* 支持者通过支持一个项目获得代币。这代表了项目社区的成员资格。\n* 支持 NFTs。可以采用数字原生藏品来奖励支持者，这些收藏品的价值可能会增长，并可作为社区成员的标志。\n* **众筹前三名贡献者，会获得独特的 NFT。**这是区分项目的超级粉丝和顶级支持者的好方法，并为活动引入了类似拍卖的竞争元素。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zhtp8odrFzK0JxD5JNhCX.png?height=415&width=960)\n\n当前阶段，Mirror 的众筹能力已经面向所有人开放，访问 [此处](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/crowdfunds)，即可发起一个众筹。\n\n**Mirror 的众筹工具已被证明是组建 DAO 的最简单方式，一个互联网原生社区可以通过众筹和 NFTs，快速的确认参与者和形成初始资金筹集。**\n\n#### 社区投票（Token Race）\n\n对于一个成熟的 DAO 来说，投票是最重要的应用。这代表了 DAO 参与者对任一决议的集体倾向和决定。\n\nMirror 的投票功能与 Snapshot 类似，提供了投票提案、令牌快照、多重签名、代理投票等能力。\n\n使用 Mirror 投票的好处是它与 Mirror 的其他构建块可以紧密的集成。通过一篇文章，创作者阐述了一个项目的创意，通过一个众筹，召集了社区的初始成员。最后通过投票，对社区的各类决议进行实施。我们看到的是创作者社区的能力闭环。\n\n### Mirror 的潜在价值\n\nWEB3 有一个重要的特征，就是价值流与信息流的合并。\n\n在 WEB2 时代，各类媒体提供信息，用户获取信息到反馈价值，是一个很漫长的链路，有的通过付费，有的通过广告，有的通过社区等等，但基本都**很难实现信息获取即价值回馈**。\n\nMirror 可以是一个 DAO 的融合工具，也可以是一个创新项目孵化器。它不仅可以为分布式协作提供强大的创作工具和能力，同时也是面向加密世界的一个路演平台。\n\n如果你有一个想法，使用 Mirror 可以快速的对想法进行分步落地：\n\n1. 发表一片文章说明你要做的事，一个什么项目或产品，亦或是写一篇研报或者拍一部电影。\n2. 针对这个想法创建一个众筹。这是建立链接的关键一步。\n3. 在你的圈子内传播它，找到愿意参与的用户。让早期用户通过众筹参与到该项目中。\n4. 通过筹集到的资金落实自己的想法。在这个过程中，可以通过 Discord 等形式，召集社区用户参与讨论。可以通过投票方式决定路线图。\n5. 落实资金使用，可以通过投票的方式分配资金用途。\n6. 发布成果，以 NFT 举例，可以将成果包装为 NFT 竞拍。收益可以按照众筹份额分配等等。\n7. 过程中的每一次创作，每一个投票，都可以是一篇 Mirror 文章。每一篇文章中都可以包含众筹和 NFT 竞拍，这即是路演，也是销售。\n8. 这些形式最终会将创作和价值反馈融合，这很摇滚！\n9. **Mirror 出于加密圈，但它服务的对象远不止加密圈。每一个个人和 DAO，不同的行业背景，都可以使用 Mirror 作为价值发现平台，通过它打开一道通向 WEB3.0 的门。**\n\n   ### 个人的尝试\n\n   对于未来的工作形态，我个人有过一些思考。长期在一个企业里，感觉不够有趣。长期一个人单打独斗，可能会过于孤独。DAO 或许会是一个不错的选择，但我并未真正参与过一个 DAO 中，或许时机不够成熟，或许缘分未到。\n\n   Mirror 的出现，Diacord 的流行，让我看到了一个可能，或许它会发展为一个 DAO，或许它是我个人创作的另一个形态，但不管怎样，它都是一次新的尝试。\n\n   在实践中去体验产品是我一贯的行为准则，这次也不例外。要深度研究 Mirror 这个产品，试图去找到未来 Web 3.0 的杀手应用，就要亲身参与进去。", "timestamp": 1633761030, "digest": "exQAX1zbAveqDZYPcLKSswzWix86b47avvcmGWs6bI8", "contributor": "0x57B93AbAC68f244150984f57cD8E3Fe00CF1B936"}

But the very same customers dumped the chai cups into the bin. So this wasn’t due to ignorance. There had to be some other reason!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*zjBa-6fy-2lk_OeDwPaOXA.png)\n\n> The designers *hypothesised* that customers were merely avoiding a fire hazard\n\nThrowing lit cigarettes into a bin full of paper cups isn’t a bright idea, after all. The designers decided to take it up as a design challenge to help avoid throwing cigarettes onto the ground in the first place.\n\n## The Problem Statement\n\n> How might we provide customers a better way to put out cigarettes?\n\nIn an indoor setting, one might use an ashtray. Could the designers make a public ashtray? One that customers can use to put out cigarettes and then safely dispose of the butts into bins? ***They had an idea! 💡*️**\n\nThey ran around the office looking for raw materials and tools to create a prototype. The best they could manage was a wooden plank.\n\n![Notice how pink Einstein’s tongue is](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*h4QCZ1kZtp5ol1wF0W1VPA.png)\n\nThe designers hoped a giant ashtray with Einstein’s face on it would grab customers’ attention and appeal to their scientific sensibilities.\n\n## Installing the prototype\n\n*Einstein* was ready. They found some light rope to tie the plank to a nearby lamp post. It turned out to be a tricky task. They struggled to mount *Einstein* — it kept sliding off. The customers looked in wonder and confusion as the designers hung their heads low.\n\n## ***Deus ex machina! 👼***\n\nTwo carpenters working in the basement of an adjacent building noticed the struggle. They volunteered to help. They took *Einstein* into their workspace and drilled holes. This helped balance the plank as they tied it to a lamp post.\n\n![Humans ❤](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*LyFI6kNL0DuXWnGC8bKiLg.png)\n\n## The Results\n\nThe designers installed the prototype and simply waited. They hoped people would\n\n1. Notice the plank\n2. Understand what its purpose is\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*a0DWEFwpoKN8BnwmyIOISQ.png)\n\n*Einstein’s* tongue got darker with each passing day. The rest of his face was quite intact. There was no vandalism of any kind, nor did anybody steal the plank — this was a huge win!\n\n## It didn’t end there\n\nPositive results inspired the designers to come back and improve the design. They started working on 2 new prototypes. They also identified another chai vendor in the vicinity to recreate the experiment.\n\n![“What client meeting?”](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*A40F9AAp-AzgP0qdYG6eHg.png)\n\n### Prototype 1: Improvements\n\nThey first sought to improve the original design. The new prototype was\n\n* more compact in form,\n* sturdier as it was made of metal, and\n* more noticeable and more readable due to the contrast between the bright orange and pitch black colours\n\n![The plank now supports the improved prototype!](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*yBPXmZqCrIi7zxs5P1PRbA.png)\n\nThe result with this prototype were consistent with that of Einstein’s. The metal mesh got darker and darker with each passing day — a sign of its increasing usage.\n\n### Prototype 2: New form factor\n\nThe biggest drawback with the Einstein was that it had to be hung. They explored a new form factor that stood on its own. Say hello to *Smoky!*\n\n![Smoky was modelled after a cigarette 🚬](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*9KxTaeq3qYU-nTWSjCvHMA.png)\n\n**Both prototypes were successful** and remained in their original locations for months. The designers have since then parted ways and have not been able to check in on *Einstein & Smoky*. But they like to think all is well!\n\nThank you for reading this far. There is no larger message to this story other than what you will make of it.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*Cu0VJtlt9VlBe50GDb30Lg.png)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633761140, "digest": "--3Y_Lo-hs8OFQcHpR6zYLkpg8Mh7ovu694j97P0WTY", "contributor": "0x4D168c89aA01843D3Fa92AFaE9C984F1A0C8918C"}

一个完全的点对点版本的电子现金将允许一方不通过金融机构直接在线支付给另一方。电子签名提供了部分解决方案，但是如果还需要一个可信任的第三方来防止双花，那么这个最大的好处也就没有意义。我们提出一个用点对点网络来解决双花的方案。这个网络给每笔交易打上时间戳，并进行哈希计算，放进一条基于哈希工作量证明的链，这形成了一个不可改变的记录，除非重做这些工作量。最长的链不仅是见证序列的证明，还证明了它来自最大的CPU算力池。因为大部分的算力由诚实的节点控制，他们将会产生一条比攻击者要长的链。网络本身需要极小化结构。消息被尽力广播，并且节点可以随意离开或重新加入网络，接受最长的工作量证明的链作为它离开这段时间发生事情的证明。\n\n1． 介绍\n\n互联网上的商业几乎完全依赖信任的第三方金融机构来处理电子支付。对于大多数交易来说，这套系统工作的足够好了，但是依然受到了基于信任模型的天然缺点的困扰。完全不能撤销的交易是不可能的，因为第三方金融机构不可避免的要调解纠纷。调解的代价增加了交易的成本，限制了最小实际交易的大小，切断了临时交易的可能性，丧失了对不可撤销服务提供不可撤销支付的可能性，这又是一个广义成本。因为撤销的可能性，信任的需要不断蔓延开来。商户必须堤防他们的客户，越来越多的他们本不该需要的信息困扰着他们。不得不接受一定比例的骗子。这些成本和支付的不确定问题可以用面对面使用现金避免，但是还没有机制存在使得通过通信信道支付而不需要信任的第三方。\n\n需要的是一个电子支付系统，这个系统建立在密码学证明基础上而不是信任，允许任意有这个意愿的双方直接相互转账而不需要一个信任的第三方。交易从计算上不可撤销的，这将保护卖方权益防止被骗，并且常规的托管机制很容易实现来保护买方权益。在本论文里，我们提出了一个防止双花的解决方案，使用点对点分布式时间戳服务器来产生按时间排序的交易的计算证明。只要诚实节点控制的CPU的算力大于攻击者节点的算力，这个系统就是安全的。\n\n2． 交易\n\n我们把一种电子币定义成一条数字签名链。每一个所有者把币转给下一个人的时候，是通过将前一个交易的哈希和下一个所有者的公钥进行数字签名，并把这些追加在币的后面。收款人可以通过验证数字签名来确认链的所有者。\n\n当然，问题是收款人无法验证其中的一个所有者是否同一个币花了两次（双花）。一个普遍的做法是引入一个信任的中央机关，或铸币厂，他们可以检查每一笔交易来防止双花问题。每次交易后，这个币必须返回到铸币厂，这样才能发行新币，只有直接从铸币厂发行的币才被相信是没有被双花的。这个方案的问题是，整个金钱系统的命运掌握在经营铸币厂的公司，每一笔交易都要经过他们，就像银行一样。\n\n我们需要一种方法，这种方法让收款人知道上一个所有者没有签署任何以前的交易。我们的目的是，让最早的交易是可信的，我们不关心后面是不是有人企图进行双花。仅有的可以确认某一个交易存在的办法是要知道所有的交易。在基于铸币厂的模型中，铸币厂知道所有的交易，并且可以确定哪个交易先发生。为了在无信任第三方的情况下达到这个目的，交易必须要对公众进行通知，并且我们需要一个系统，这个系统的参与者要达成共识，这个共识就是认同同一个按收到的交易顺序排列的历史记录。收款人需要证据来说明在每一笔交易的时候，大多数节点一致认为这个交易是第一时间到达的。\n\n3． 时间戳服务器\n\n我们提出的解决方案从一个时间戳服务器开始。这个服务器工作方式是，对条目所在的区块的哈希加盖时间戳，并且广泛的公布这些哈希，比如通过报纸或新闻组邮件。显然，为了能进入这个哈希序列，时间戳证明的数据在那个时间必须存在。每一个时间戳和以前的时间戳，形成一条链，每一个追加的时间戳都是对前一个时间戳进行加强。\n\n4． 工作量证明\n\n为了基于点对点的基础实现一个分布式的时间戳服务器，我们将需要一个工作量证明的系统，这个系统和亚当·贝克的哈希现金类似，而不是报纸或新闻组邮件。这个工作量包含寻找一个哈希值，比如用哈希算法SHA-256，这个哈希值以若干0开头。平均工作量和开头的0的个数是指数关系，并且验证很简单，只需要执行一次单独的哈希计算。\n\n在我们的时间戳网络里，是这样实现工作量证明的，就是不断增加区块里的一个临时的数值，直到找到一个值使得区块的哈希值满足开头0的个数的要求。一旦CPU花费算力计算满足了工作量证明的要求，这个区块链就无法修改，除非重新计算。随着后面的区块不断产生，想要改变这个区块，需要重做它后面所有区块的工作量。\n\n工作量证明还解决了在多数决策法中决定展示的问题。如果大多数是基于一个IP一票，这可能会被可以支配多个IP的人破坏。工作量证明本质上也是一个IP一票。最长的链代表了大多数人的决定，这个链投入了最大的工作量。如果大多数的CPU算力由诚实节点控制，诚实的链就会增加的很快，超过任何竞争链。为了修改过去的一个块，攻击者需要重新投入算力完成这个区块和它以后所有区块的工作量，然后追上并超越诚实节点的工作量。我们后面讨论落后的攻击者追上的概率，这个概率随着后面区块的增加呈指数级减少。\n\n硬件的速度越来越快，参与运行的节点随时间兴趣也经常变化，为了抵消这些因素的影响，工作量的难度是由每小时区块产生数量的浮动性决定的。如果区块产生的太快，难度就相应的增加。\n\n5． 网络\n\n运行这个网络的步骤如下：\n\n1） 新交易给所有节点广播。\n\n2） 每个节点将新交易放到一个区块。\n\n3） 每个节点开始为这个区块寻找相应难度的工作量证明。\n\n4） 当一个节点找到了这个工作量证明，把这个区块广播给所有节点。\n\n5） 如果区块里所有的交易是有效的并且是没有被花费的，节点就会接受这个区块。\n\n6） 节点把这个区块的哈希作为上一个哈希，并开始进行工作以竞争创建下一个区块。\n\n节点总是认为最长的链是正确的，并且不断的工作去延长它。如果两个节点同时广播下一个区块，一些节点可能接受其中一个，也可能是另一个。这种情况下，他们在最先收到的区块上工作，但是也会保存另外一个分支以防它会变得更长。当下一个工作量被找到并且一个分支变得更长时，这种情况就会被打破，在另外一个分支上工作的节点将会切换到这个长的链上。\n\n新交易广播不一定要广播到所有节点。只要他们能到达很多节点，这个交易很快就会进入下一个块。区块广播也能接受消息丢失。如果一个节点没有收到区块，当它收到下一个块时会发现自己少了一个区块，它就会请求来获得少的这个区块。\n\n6． 激励\n\n按照惯例，区块的第一个交易是一个特别的交易，这个交易会发行新币并且所有者是这个区块的创建者。这为节点支持网络引入了激励机制，并且这提供了一个初始发行货币进入流通的方式，因为没有一个中央机构去发行他们。不断增加新货币的过程类似于黄金矿工消耗资源来增加黄金的流通。在这里，消耗的事CPU的时间和电费。\n\n激励还包括提供交易手续费。如果交易中输出值比输入值小，这个差值就是交易手续费，它被加入到这个区块激励值里。一旦预定数量的币全部进入流通，激励就全部转为交易手续费，完全没有通货膨胀。\n\n激励有助于鼓励节点保持诚实。如果一个贪婪的攻击者掌握了比所有诚实节点还要大的算力，他将面临一个选择，是通过偷回他支付的钱来咋骗别人，还是用这个算力产生新的币。他应该会发现遵守规则更有好处，这个规则可以让他比其他人组合得到更多的新币，比破坏这个系统得到的更多，而且财产合法。\n\n7． 回收磁盘空间\n\n一旦一个币最新的交易被足够多的区块埋没，它之前的花费的交易就可以丢掉来节省空间。为了促成这个而不破坏区块的哈希，用这些交易生成一个默克尔树，仅仅根包含在区块的哈希里。那么旧区块可以通过去除树的一些分支进行压缩。有些内部的哈希就不用保存了。\n\n一个区块头大概80字节。如果我们假设每十分钟产生一个区块，一年就是80字节*6*24\\*365=4.2兆字节。2008年出售的电脑典型的配置是2GB内存，根据摩尔定律预测，每年增加1.2G，即使区块头全部放在内存里，存储也不是个问题。\n\n8． 简化支付验证\n\n即使不运行全网络节点，验证支付也是可能的。用户仅需要保存最长工作量证明链的区块头的拷贝，他通过查询网络节点直到确信它有最长的链来获取区块头，并且可以得到默克尔分支，分支连接了交易和这个打了时间戳的区块。他本身不能验证交易，但是通过连接到链上的一个地方，他可以看到网络节点已经接受了它，后面的区块进一步确定网络接受了它。\n\n因此，如果诚实节点控制着网络，验证就是可靠的，如果网络被攻击者控制，验证就是很弱的。虽然网络节点本身可以验证交易，但这种简化验证的方法会被攻击者编造的交易欺骗，因为攻击者可能持续控制网络。防止这种情况的一种策略是接收网络节点的告警，当他们检测到无效块的时候，提示用户软件下载整个区块，并且提醒确认交易的一致性。频繁接收支付的企业可能仍然想运行他们自己的节点，为了更独立的安全性和更快的验证。\n\n9． 组合和分割价值\n\n虽然可以单独处理币，为转账的每一分都单独交易是很不方便的。为了能是价值分割和组合，交易包含多个输入和多个输出。正常的会有一个单独从以前交易来的大额输入或多个小额输入组合在一起，最多两个输出：一个用来支付，一个用来找零，有零钱的话会返还给发送者。\n\n应该注意的是，一个交易依赖几个交易，这些交易依赖更多的交易，看起来很分散，但在这里不是一个问题。从不需要提取一个交易全部历史的独立的拷贝。\n\n10． 隐私\n\n传统的银行通过限制向有关方和信任的第三方提供信息来达到一个保护隐私的目的。向公众广播所有交易的必须性将这个方法排除了。通过打破信息在其他地方的流动性仍然可以保护隐私：通过保持公钥匿名性。公众可以看到一个人给其他人转钱了，但是没有信息可以把交易和某人联系起来。这类似于证券交易所公布的信息水平，交易时间和个人的交易规模是公开的，但不告诉当事人是谁。\n\n作为一个附加的防火墙，每次交易都使用一个新的密钥对，防止和一个共同的所有者联系起来。对于多输入交易来说，这个联系无法避免，所有的输入必须表明由同一个人所有。风险是如果表明了某一个密钥的所有者，这种联系将表明其他的交易也属于同一个人。\n\n11． 计算\n\n我们想象一个这样的场景，攻击者想用比诚实节点更快的速度产生一个替代链。即使成功了，也不会让系统能任意被修改，比如凭空产生价值或拿走不属于攻击者的钱。节点将不会接受一个无效的支付，并且诚实节点绝不会接受包含这种支付的区块。攻击者只能试着改变自己的交易来拿回本该花出去的钱。\n\n诚实的链和攻击链的竞争可以说是二项式随机走动。成功事件是诚实链延长一个区块，领先优势加一，失败事件是攻击链延长一个区块，缩小一个差距。\n\n一个攻击者从一个给定的赤字中追上的概率类似于一个赌徒破产问题。假设一个信用无限的赌徒从赤字开始，开始进行潜在次数无数的赌博，试图达到盈亏平衡。我们可以计算他达到盈亏平衡的概率，或者说是攻击链赶上诚实链的概率，如下：\n\np=诚实节点发现下一个区块的概率\n\nq=攻击者找到下一个区块的概率\n\nqz =攻击者在落后z个区块的情况下，追上的概率\n\n假设p>q，随着落后区块数量（z）增加，攻击者追上的概率呈指数下降。这个概率情况对攻击者不利，如果他没有幸运的提前向前冲刺，落后越多希望就越渺茫。\n\n我们现在考虑接收者在收到新的交易的时候，需要等待多长时间才能完全确定交易不能被发送者修改。我们假设发送者是攻击者，他想让接收者暂时相信他已经付款了，然后过了一段时间又换成是支付给自己。这事发生的时候接收者会收到告警，但是发送者希望一切都晚了。\n\n接收者创建了一个新的密钥对，签名之前很短的时间把公钥给了发送者。这防止发送者提前准备一条链，持续在上面工作，直到他足够幸运达到了领先的程度，正好执行刚才这条交易。一旦这个交易发送了，不诚实的发送者开始在一个并行的链上秘密工作，这条链包含他的交易的另一个版本。\n\n接收者一直等待直到交易被添加到一个区块中，并且后面已经追加了z个区块了。他并不知道攻击者的准确进展，但是可以假设诚实区块每个区块花费的时间是平均期望时间，攻击者潜在的进展将服从泊松分布，期望值：\n\n为了得到目前攻击者仍能追上的概率，我们将他所取得的每一步进展的泊松密度乘以他可能从那一点赶上的概率。\n\n变换一下避免对分布的无穷尾部求和…\n\n转换成C代码…\n\n\\#include <math.h>\ndouble AttackerSuccessProbability(double q, int z)\n{\ndouble p = 1.0 - q;\ndouble lambda = z \\* (q / p);\ndouble sum = 1.0;\nint i, k;\nfor (k = 0; k <= z; k++)\n{\ndouble poisson =

结论\n\n我们为无信任电子交易提出了一个系统。我们从数字签名币的常用框架开始，它对所有者有很强的控制，但是因为不能避免双花，所以还不完整。为了解决双花，我们提出了一个点对点的网络，这个网络使用工作量证明记录一个公共的交易历史，只要诚实节点控制大部分CPU算力，很快使得攻击者无法通过计算来改变交易历史。该网络的非结构化简单性使得它很稳健。节点同时工作，很少需要相互协调。他们不需要被识别，因为消息不需要路由到任何特定的位置，只需尽力传递就好。节点可以离开网络，也可以需要的时候重新加入网络，接受工作量链作为他离开的时候发生了什么的证据。他们用CPU算力投票，通过在有效区块上工作并延续它来表达对区块的接受，通过不在新区块上工作表示拒绝无效区块。任何需要的规则和激励都可以在这种共识机制下进行。",

They observed how customers interacted with the space. Here’s what they saw:\n\n* Customers usually bought *chai & sutta* (cigarette) together\n* They would finish the chai and throw the cups into the bin\n* They would throw the cigarettes butts on the ground and put them out with their feet\n* ***They would leave the butts behind on the ground***\n\nOnce a butt was on the ground, nobody made an effort to pick it back up.

{"id": "ifWASCNxqqux0xnD7gyKsMl1EqtZHZq1YfYgnsKU_KU", "title": "加密货币市场四季度大势、趋势及热点全展望", "body": "整体市场及底层公链展望\n在这个周期中，我们会看到加密市场比以前周期成熟得多，在那些表现出色的区块链网络和协议中，价值叙事和基本面要素将发挥着更大的作用。因此，成为活跃的早期用户变得越来越重要，这样你就可以体验每个平台，并真正形成哪些更好或更差的切实认知。此外，您会因为积极参与每个网络而经常获得奖励。过去一年的很多空投都带来 4-6 位数不等的收益，当然，具体要看个人的贡献——比如，回想一下 UNI / 1INCH / dYdX 的空投。今年，我们看到加密货币被传统金融机构合法化（投资）的次数比以往任何时候都多，这推动大量资金涌入加密货币领域。这些以前游离在加密领域之外的投资者对投资标的精挑细选，且会决定将进行哪些长期赌注。当这些机构将资金分配给 BTC 以外的加密资产时，他们需要一个过程来评估相关加密网络，并确定哪个具有最大的优势。\n我认为底层公链今年的表现将优于所有其他山寨币，原因之一，是因为它们是押注智能合约系统去中心化未来的最简单途径之一。所有去中心化应用（DApp）将在这些底层区块链网络之上运行，相比于押注这些底层网络，大海捞针地去筛选单独的借贷协议或去中心化交易所（DEX）则要困难得多。你可能会认为，这些网络的整体未来预期价值远高于比特币（BTC）的未来预期，BTC 主要用作价值储存。从技术分析角度，在我看来，与 ETH/BTC 货币对的多年区间实现突破，且形成与其一致的圆顶走势图，是今年的最主要趋势，市场正在显示未来的走向。这是迄今为止唯一一个 BTC 没有创下历史峰值的周期。由于 ETH 在过去一年的表现优于 BTC，其他 L1 网络，例如 Solana、Avalanche、Terra （Luna）、Fantom 和 Harmony 的表现也大大优于以太坊。这些网络较新，经历较少的实战测试，但它们目前都以更快、更便宜的智能合约平台的角色运行，这些平台从对冲基金和其他押注未来成功的机构及投资人手中获得了大量资金。FTX 创始人 SBF 身为 Solana 的顾问，领导了这股潮流。由于他之前与传统金融圈子的密切联系，以及身为 FTX / Alameda Research 首席执行官的巨大影响力，让他的名字在影响高净值个人 + 传统基金方面举足轻重。大多数传统金融公司在 2017 年时对加密货币普遍持有的负面看法，而当前的情况截然不同，仅 PYTH 的合作伙伴名单就清楚表明，公众舆论已经发生了惊人的转变。传统金融机构（tradFi）进入加密货币的最引人瞩目例子之一是 Jump Capital， 后者最近成立了自己的独立加密基金部门，他们甚至表示，他们一直积极参与 PYTH 以及其他区块链（如 LUNA）的治理。很可能还有很多其他类似于 Jump Capital 的基金，要么在等待合适的机会参与其中，要么在幕后悄悄地撸起袖子干活。每个 L1 公链都有自己的早期投资者和强大的创始人，他们致力于构建自己的生态系统：AVAX 有 Emin + 3AC、Terra Luna 有 Do Kwon + Novo。我认为，我们将在未来几年继续看到新的资本和新的能力超强的开发者进军加密领域，而随着美元资本和人才库的增长，我们将看到一个由不同智能合约平台组成的、蓬勃发展的生态系统，用户将能够选择从中自由选择。\n考虑到这一点，我认为基础货币应该是 ETH，交易应该专注于跑赢 ETH。如果你在链上做任何事情（这应该构成你交易的主要部分）， 需要以 ETH 作为参照起点。在购买 NFT、替代币、「桥」资产时，你应该确保业绩跑赢持有 ETH。将 2021 年的山寨币领域与 2017 年的山寨币领域进行比较，在我看来没有多大意义，因为当时的价值与现在相比微乎其微。以前你需要 BTC 才能在任何交易所购买任何替代币，而我们当时唯一使用的 DEX 是 etherdelta。现在的山寨币生态系统比 4-5 年前复杂得多，这就是为什么 ALT/ETH 图表在我看来比 ALT/BTC 更重要的原因。\n我个人认为，BTC 现在是我投资组合中最主要的避险资产，因为我认为，随着其规模的增长，以及其市值越来越接近黄金之类的东西，其波动性将继续呈下降趋势。同时，目前参与投资 BTC 的机构试图长期累积 BTC，我们会迎来一个缓慢的上涨，而不是像 2017 年那样的抛物线，这符合机构的最佳利益。每当散户衍生品交易者遭遇爆仓狂潮时，我们将继续看到 BTC 的市场回调。ETH 和其他币种，我仍然认为是一种交易，而当我想降低风险并从多头获利时，持有 BTC 可以是我的投资组合中这一部分的最佳选择。BTC 也非常适合用于衡量整个市场的回调程度，因为它是最容易用作对冲资产的加密资产，而且每当 BTC 遭到抛售，大量山寨币的抛售狂潮则更为凶猛。BTC 作为硬通货没有任何竞争对手，因此 BTC 一直会随着加密资产的增长而继续增长，即使它在创新方面并没有领先其它加密货币。你应该始终将 BTC 堆栈与从未接触过的活跃交易堆栈隔离开来，可以根据个人的风险喜好程度累积自己最喜欢的 L1 货币而进行交易。这些资产风险较大，因为前几年曾涌现出很多以太坊的竞争对手，而现在相比四年前的影响力已经严重式微，例如，波场 /DRGN/EOS。由于 FTX / SBF / Alameda 的持久影响力，我个人认为 Solana 是 仅次于 ETH 的最佳选择，但我认为这是主观想法而已。对山寨币的主要关注点应该是审视其 ALT/ETH 币对走势，当在每个 L1 生态系统中交易山寨币时，您应该仔细研究那些 ALT/L1 图表。例如，Solana 生态系统中的很多 SPL 代币全年业绩表现都不及 SOL。\n在接下来的一个季度中，我预计这一趋势将延续下去，因为这些 L1 智能合约平台在用户和网络锁定资金量方面会缩小与以太坊之间的差距。目前，这类 L1 中的市场领头羊（SOL / AVAX / LUNA / FTM / ONE）相比 7 月的低点上涨了 5-10 倍，而 ETH 的市场表现落于下风。就短期而言，我认为 SOL 涨得有点过凶，而 LUNA 最近在今年早些时候以来的历史最高点范围附近波动。预期 Solana 将在这一区间形成新的盘整波段，而其他币种则开始启动新的趋势。如果我们确实迎来 L1 山寨币一段时间的横向盘整，且 ETH 跑赢大盘，我预计 L1 山寨币网络上的开发者活动 / 用户活动 / 总锁仓（TVL）将继续呈上升趋势。如果这种情况因任何原因戛然而止，我个人会重新评估关于这些币种中长期表现会更出色的论点。在现有的 L1 中，Terra Luna 和 ONE 在短期内可能会有最强的上涨，而 AVAX 是基于以太坊虚拟机（EVM）的最强以太坊竞争对手。\n关于标杆币种比特币和以太坊的展望\n我对下个季度的 BTC 和 ETH 走势都持看涨态度，两者在夏季的大部分时间都从 6 月的低点反弹，在第三季度的 7 月向上突破。在过去的一个月里，我们看到了自 6 月下旬以来一波涨势以来的首次大幅回调，预计我们将在近期形成一个在宏观上较高的低点，然后在年底前推高至新高。\n随着 ETF 的批准，BTC 有潜在的催化剂，但其价值主张此时已经得到了各种类型的机构参与者的验证，我认为近期的价格影响不会像 2017 年那样巨大。我个人认为，鉴于中国出台的政策、对 BTC 挖矿 / 交易活动的打击，以及当时处于价格峰值的恐惧，这些基本面事件导致大量抛售和资金外流，我们在夏季本来有可能守不住 3 万美元的低点。BTC 挖矿活动在地域分布上的调整，从长期看应该是利好，因为这一活动更趋于去中心化，分散到不受监管限制的地域。如果我们看到更多类似于萨尔瓦多的政策决定，这可能会是一个主要的看涨催化剂。从技术分析来看，BTC 价格会守住\\~3.8 万-4 万美元区域，抢先突破区间高点，\\~4.07 万美元是夏季三个月区间的最高日收盘价。我认为低点已经到位，但如果本季度开始时下潜至 3.6 万-3.7 万美元，我不会感到惊讶。只要我们的周线收盘价不低于区间高点\\~4.2 万-4.3 万美元，我就笃定接下来的几个月里会继续上涨，并刷新历史高点纪录。\n以太坊已经实施了 EIP-1559 提案升级，其下一个主要催化剂，即主网与信标链的合并和转向权益证明（PoS）共识机制的计划要推迟到 2022 年第二季度，但越来越清楚的是，ETH 是互联网的主要货币。你需要 ETH 来购买 NFT、在 DEX 上进行交易、使用所有借贷协议进行存款等。虽然以太坊面临来自其他 L1 的竞争，但我们看到的是，加密货币整体用户群体不断壮大，而不是 ETH 用户离开以太坊转投其它 L1。高 Gas 费用的瓶颈是散户拥抱以太坊的重大障碍，但 L2 解决方案的发展正在迅速解决这个问题。即使没有这些 L2 解决方案，很多 ETH 长期用户目前也已身家万贯，Gas 费用对他们而言不过是毛毛雨。从投资的角度来看，其他 L1 确实有更大的上涨空间，但因为它们的盘子更小，而且经过的实战测试较少，因此要获得更多回报，就需要承担更多风险，但以太坊绝对不会很快消失。我在中长期看好 ETH/BTC，因为我认为智能合约平台的天花板高过 BTC 作为价值存储的上限。我每天都在使用 ETH，而我个人很少使用 BTC。\n以太坊生态的 DeFi 展望\n自 3 月初 ETH 再次冲击自 2017 年以来的历史新高之后，所有主要的 DeFi 蓝筹代币与 ETH 的比价都一直在持续下跌。市场已经明确表态，这些网络的估值并不代表它们当前的使用情况，相比之下，DeFi 的底层网络价值（ETH）被低估了。很多 ETH-DeFi 替代币和其他拖后腿的币种未能创下历史新高，甚至未能突破 6 月份以来的高点。去年我们迎来了第一个「DeFi 之夏」，那时 AAVE、COMP、Uniswap 等平台人气真正爆棚。 当时 DeFi 相关代币是市场上最新的山寨币，这就是它们的表现如此优异的主要原因。以太坊之外的其他智能合约平台上当时不存在 DeFi，而现在，多个不同的链上都拥有了 DeFi，并且很多情况下这些 L1 上具有 EVM 兼容性，这可能会是扭转这些 DeFi 资产相对 ETH 下跌趋势的价值叙事，因为随着新资本进入 DeFi 领域，它们的使用量可能会增加。这些代币对 ETH 的比值目前已回到年初以来的低点附近。除了 DeFi 蓝筹股之外，DeFi 中还有很多新的创新完全来自全新的协议，例如 OHM / SPELL。 我认为 ETH-DeFi 的最大优势在于这些机会，然后是去中心化衍生品领域。由于一些正在严厉打击加密交易，而且许多其他非 KYC 的交易所正在降低其提款限额或强制使用 KYC，我们将看到用户从中心化交易所（CEX）流向链上交易。 dYdX 已经展示出这种趋势的出现，去中心化的永续合约交易量可与某些具有良好流动性的 CEX 相媲美。DPX 是另一种去中心化替代方案，致力于构建期权平台。在 Solana 上现在有了 Mango Markets 和 PsyOptions 等平台。在接下来的几个月以及 2022 年，所有这些平台的用户增长都应该会加快。\nDeFi 代币一直以来很好地扮演了对其他多头 / 现货头寸的对冲，但随着我们进入这个新的多链阶段（EVM DApp 可以跨区块链部署），这种趋势可能很快就会宣告结束。 正如我之前所说，我认为趋势将会是：新的机构资本进入加密领域，押注 DeFi + 智能合约的长期成功，在可用选项中，最佳循环投注标的是替代性 L1 的代币，其市值相比 ETH 要小得多，且目前性能优于以太坊，只是不那么安全。\n对于对冲选项，现在最好寻找没有那么多资本进入的较弱的 L1 + 较小的社区，而不是 ETH-DeFi 资产。随着替代性 L1 捕捉到新加密货币进局者的市场份额，并逐渐蚕食 ETH 的市场主导地位，我认为这将继续是最好的交易。\n如果投资 ETH-DeFi 代币，我认为最好关注较新的协议（能为以前不存在的用户提供价值） + 关注当前的市场趋势，现在 EVM 的当红趋势是多链 /「桥」项目和去中心化衍生品，而不要去盲目购买所谓的 DeFi 「蓝筹股」。\nNFT 市场展望\n在我看来，NFT 是最有意思的细分市场，因为它们吸引了完全没有加密背景人群的极大兴趣，让加密社区之外的人们加入可爱的数字图片 + 链游，比解释 P2P 借贷和金融系统更新迭代的优势要容易得多。我在这里看到了四个主要趋势：具有历史价值的链上和生成艺术、头像 NFT 社区 + 公司进入该领域、销售个人作品的传统艺术家和摄影师，以及链游。\n单纯从历史角度看，加密原住民对最早和最有影响力的链上作品（例如 Punks / ArtBlocks ）给予高价值，是去年年底其他人对 NFT 产生浓厚兴趣的跳板。由于以太坊是第一个智能合约平台，因此从溯源和早期社区的角度来看，随着加密领域的发展壮大，其网络上的第一批 NFT 将会保持很高的价值。我很想知道这种趋势是否也适用于其他替代性 L1 公链，这些公链刚刚都在自己的平台上推出了第一批 NFT。Solana、Fantom、AVAX、Harmony 和其他项目现在都有一些 NFT 项目和相关的 NFT 市场。一直使用这些平台作为自己首选生态系统的早期用户，可能会像以太坊一族对 Punks 等项目的青睐一样，认为这些平台上的项目颇具价值。看一下生成艺术类别中，很明显，即使铸造成本增加，Art Blocks 仍然是占主导地位的平台。 之后还会诞生像 Fidenza 这样广受欢迎的作品，尤其是随着时间推移，生成艺术家的数量会越来越多。\n可能最具人气的趋势是以散户为中心的头像 NFT 项目。我们已经看到了像无聊猿游艇俱乐部（Bored Ape Yacht Club，BAYC）这样的项目大获成功，看到它如何吸引了很多体坛巨星、以及其他和加密货币毫不搭界人士的密切关注。我们还看到，很多传统企业试图利用 NFT 进行自己的营销。随着越来越多的公司最终看到了构建线上社区的价值，Visa 购买一个 Punk，以及虚拟宠物游戏站 Neopets 在 Solana 上推出经典角色集合等事件，只是这一趋势的开始。在我看来，NFT 收藏是迄今为止引导用户社区的最佳方式，因为它比起传统营销方式中向人们发送电子邮件列表或让人们购买商品而言，具体的参与感要强烈地多。当您构建一个所有人都持有 NFT 的社区时，向这些人分配价值要容易得多，而且他们也会对社区有更多的资金投入。我们已经看到了不断有项目分别推出自己的 10,000 套 NFT，而公司将在如何使用 NFT 进行营销方面变得更有创意。不过，这一趋势的主要障碍是让新用户获得加密钱包，这是一个很容易解决的用户体验问题。在即将到来的这个季度，我认为领先的头像图片（PFP）项目，比如 Punks / BAYC / Cool Cats / SMBs，和其他项目会继续有出色表现，但最有价值的可能是从中间梯队项目找到蒙尘的珍珠，其作品有机会能在市场的重新定价中获得更高的价格。我最看好 Creatures，因为我看好该项目创始人、21 岁的纽约艺术家 Danny Cole，以及他们迄今为止为为持币者的良好体验付出的巨大努力，似乎 Cole 对该项目规划的长期愿景只是他艺术作品进入数字世界的延伸。从视觉角度而言，0N1 Forces 仍然是我个人的最爱，从 Discord 频道来看，该团队也计划通过面对面的活动以及向持币者空投来建立社区。一般来说，这些 PFP 项目的代币表现实际上取决于这些项目如何为持币人创造价值，以及如何让社区参与。另一方面，在 NFT 领域中始终存在很多纯粹是为了抢钱的骗子项目，因为可以轻而易举地让人们铸造任何东西。请积极参与 Discord 和其他社交媒体的讨论，应该有助于你鉴别项目的质量，但最谨慎起见，最好在第一周左右不要轻举妄动，认真观察项目在市场上的发展情况。我真的很想看看这些元宇宙（Metaverse）世界是如何构建的，以及团队之间可能展开的合作，在这些方面做得很好并创造出凝聚力体验的项目将抢占巨大的优势。目前我只看到规划路线图，但在接下来的一年左右时间里，我们应该看看哪些项目能够在这一领域创造价值。\n链游结合了 NFT 和边玩边赚（Play-2-Earn）生态系统，也吸引了很多新用户进入加密社区。第一个成功重现 Roblox （世界最大的多人在线创作游戏）或 堡垒之夜（Fortnite）等游戏平台神话、同时还整合了一个允许用户边玩边赚钱系统的团队，将是迄今为止最成功的加密 DApp 之一。随着游戏开发商进军这个领域，像 Solana 和 AVAX 这样允许进行很多廉价微交易和高吞吐量的平台，应该在这方面具备优势。各大基金正在为黑客松提供 9 位数的激励计划，以吸引开发者进行构建，这应该会加速高质量的软件开发工程师向加密领域的过渡。链游 Axie Infinity 在菲律宾取得了巨大成功，目前是该领域最赚钱的山寨币，它绝对是元宇宙趋势的市场领导者，应该密切关注该行业的趋势节点或并购整合动态。我认为，10 月会看到元宇宙生态系统代币会开始迅速重拾涨势，AXS 质押将是一个巨大的催化剂。Parallel NFT 纸牌游戏是这一领域的另一个领跑者，尽管他们的游戏还没有正式推出。他们的作品真正与艺术很好地组合在一起，到目前为止，他们在培养社区方面也做得很好，充分细分的系统非常有利于用户的参与和竞争。此外，他们的团队也吸引了著名的投资人，比如来自 Youtube 的 Chad Hurley 等等。其他可能的早期赢家包括 Star Atlas 和 Aurory 之类的游戏，但目前尚未明确游戏玩法，我们无法真正了解具体细节。 我有一份小盘项目清单，我需要对其进行更多研究，然后才能发表我的长期观点 （ILV / PYR / RAINI / YGG 和其他一些项目）。要想从这些游戏中获得最大价值，我认为您必须「在市场确信它们会成功之前」就早早入局投资，当人们还充满怀疑的时候，您会以最好的折扣买入其资产。\n传统艺术家推出自己的 NFT 项目，也是一个值得关注的重要趋势。我已经提到了 Danny Cole 的 Creatures，但还会有更多类似的项目。 通过纸质媒介销售艺术品，比销售 NFT 困难得多，因为后者中所有东西都可以通过数字方式轻松访问。我对这种趋势没有太多预测，因为我对传统艺术知之甚少，但我确实认为，逆潮流的噱头会随着时间而消失。当人们第一次看到他们不理解的东西时，这似乎是他们的下意识反应。\n值得关注的四季度投资组合配置\n10 月份我的核心头寸将是 LUNA，因为其 Columbus-5 网络升级将成为其币价起飞的催化剂，我还会押注元宇宙 / 游戏领域的领军者 Axie。L1 表现出色和 NFT 是今年的两个主要趋势，因此在其中分配的资金要高于其它领域。\n\n除此之外的资金主要投入 LP 收益耕种和一些特定的市场板块。BTC 和 ETH 将缓慢移动，因此主要是抢短差交易（Scalping）策略而不是持有长期波动性，直到我认为其他地方没有更高的 beta 回报才会投入。一旦 ETH 重新站上约 3600 美元，我认为它会很快创下历史新高。BTC 在它需要突破的 5.5 万-5.8 万美元箱体仍然面临很大阻力，所以我会在这一区间寻找即将改写箱体高点的机会入场。一旦突破 5.8 万美元这一点位，我担心 ALT/BTC 会表现不佳，并开始推动价格发现。\n\n从技术分析来看，LUNA 已经在自 3 月以来的历史高点上方盘整了约 40 天，从夏季低点的底部上涨了约 6 倍。一旦 Columbus-5 上线，并且生态系统中的所有其他项目都启动，我预计它会向上突破。\n\nAxie 处于类似的情况，并且在最初发力后已经盘整了两个月。在大约一周前的回调行情中，它重新测试了 7 月以来的高点，并强力反弹。\n\n我的 LP 收益耕种 / 单边赌注分布在多个链中，保持流动性是其中重要的原因之一，可以在最好的机会出现时迅速转移资金。最近的两个主要例子是 AVAX 上的 $TEDDY 和 Harmony 上的 $JEWEL，如果你已经关注这些生态系统，则更容易找到这样的机会。\n\n对于 BTC 和 ETH，底部的更强确认，将会在 4.5 万美元 / 3100 美元以上带来突破。\n对市场的总体看法：预计比特币和以太坊这样的标杆币种上涨趋势缓慢，具有强大基本面催化剂的山寨币的表现优于其他山寨币，而恐龙级山寨币和其他未能交付价值的山寨币则继续表现不佳。理想的轮换是在 10 月份将 LUNA / Axie 投入价格发现，之后转向标杆币种，然后在明年第一季度之前重新创建 Solana 头寸，作为主要持有资产。\n\n我对 NFT 的市场周期节点的认知，不如我对标杆币种和替代币那么了如指掌，所以只是持有我认为被低估的那些 NFT，直到市场对其它们重新定价。\n\n我还将继续密切关注以太坊的合并，因为届时将成为 ETH 跑赢其他 L1 的催化剂，可能会重演 ETH 在 2021 年 4 月至 5 月的一波行情。\n\n微观视角看项目价值\nL1 币种\nLUNA\n\nColumbus-5 网络升级： 9 月 29-30 日\n届时将实现与 IBC 和 Cosmos 生态系统中其他所有区块链的整合\n整合 Ozone Insurance\n整合 Wormhole ，在 Solana 和 Luna 之间建立「桥」\n所有用于铸造 $UST 的 LUNA 都将被销毁\n总体理论是 UST 将在多个链上得到更多使用，这对 LUNA 来说将带来通货紧缩，Columbus-5 升级后很多新项目将在 Terra LUNA 生态系统中推出，将吸引新用户，而通过使用 Terra 和虫洞桥，很容易将这些项目和用户连接起来。在我看来，该项目目前在西半球并不是那么受欢迎，因为它的主要社区在东半球，但在接下来的几个月里应该会发生变化。\nSOL\n\n目前不是我的主要持仓，因为我认为其他资产有更多的上涨空间，但我的个人整体交易指标是瞄准跑赢 Solana，因为它整年都是市场领跑者。我认为，一旦 Solana 完成了从最近的整合，这种强劲势头将会延续。可能在近期引爆涨势的催化剂是 EVM 的集成，以及当前黑客松的落幕。\nSolana NFT 的表现也非常好。SOL 最近的大部分涨势都发生在其创下历史高点之后，我认为这对于人们将收益回流给生态系统是件好事。Solana Monkey Business 目前绝对是这一市场中的领跑者，但还有很多其他项目不断在启动。对于大多数新的 Solana NFT 项目我并没有逐一跟踪，但认真关注 Twitter 上的发展态势以及市场上最流行的趋势，是确定哪些项目最有前途的好办法。\nSolana 上开发的链游的发展态势非常看好，这就是为什么我认为，Aurorians 会是最好的押注之一。\n从技术分析来看，在 BTC 守住阵地的同时，SOL 价格没有进一步回撤，会在 150 美元上方盘整巩固后再向上反弹。如果 SOL 持续向下，这将是一个很好的现货做多机会，但考虑到投资者对 SOL 的强烈关注，我们是否得到这一机会尚未可知。\n我认为 10 月左右会进行盘整，但需要一直关注 SOL，因为不想因为忽视而错过它的行情启动。\nAVAX\n\n自8 月中旬以来，AVAX 币价和AVAX 生态系统中微小盘项目的表现一直非常强劲。JOE 一直是顶尖表现选手，并且比当时的低点上涨了约100 倍。随着与AAVE 一起推出流动性挖矿计划，AVAX 和JOE 应该会继续呈上升趋势，但我认为目前LUNA 比AVAX 有更多优势。在我看来，AVAX 目前绝对是EVM DApp 的第一阵营区块链，因此用户可以简单易用、开发者可以轻松移植，是推动其币价上涨的一个非常强大因素。即使Arbitrum 推出，我也不认为AVAX 链上会有出现任何重大项目流失。zk rollup 是否会改变这种情况，非常值得观察一下，但是如果ETH L2 解决方案与AVAX 的用户体验没有显着不同，那么我认为rollup 的登场不会造就AVAX 的熊市。我持有一小部分AVAX，期盼从新的生态发布中获利。Teddy Cash 是AVAX 上新的贷款协议之一，在过去一周左右的时间里表现良好，我认为，该币种仍然没有进入大批投资者的视野，因为它的市值只有约2500 万美元左右。该项目中用户可以使用AVAX 作为借入其稳定币TSD 的抵押品，并且目前还有一些LP 收益耕种农场正在进行中。Harmony / $ONE\n\n与 AVAX / SOL / FTM 一样具备高性能和短时延，但知名度属于小且透明。具备功能跨链桥、可兼容 EVM，Harmony 所缺乏的只是社区开发和项目开发。这让我感觉 ONE 与 2 月初的 SOL 非常类似，当时 Solana 区块链的速度很快，但上面只有一个 DApp：Raydium。 几周前，Harmony 启动了一个 3 亿美元的生态系统基金，以刺激开发、鼓励建设者，所以希望很快就会看到更多的项目出现。 DeFi Kingdoms DEX 是我 9 月份收获最为丰厚的押注之一，其团队对外沟通了未来目标，并且一直在有效地发布更新。除了交换 / 收益耕种实用用例之外，它是我见过的唯一一个在为用户创建基准元宇宙世界方面做得很好的 DEX。我暂时不打算离开 Jewel / ONE 收益耕种农场，想观望一下他们如何开发游戏以及 NFT 如何与整个生态系统互动。\nLayer 0\nATOM\n\n如果 Cosmos 能够从使用 Cosmos SDK 构建的所有项目中收获到价值，那么从长远来看，Cosmos 资产的上涨潜力巨大。当前已经有大量出色的项目采用了他们的架构进行构建，而现在的重点是通过 IBC 将它们全部连接起来，以 Cosmos Hub 作为核心。持币者从 Atom 中收获的价值一直很少，直到最近才略有改观。现在，基于 Cosmos SDK 构建的区块链正通过 IBC 变得整合度更高，观察一下这将如何影响 Atom 币价会是件有意思的事情，或在治理中通过哪些提案来改变架构。Cosmos 提案 #56 提议将 Cosmos Hub 作为连接到 IBC 所有链的路由器，这应该会是未来几个月推动其币价上涨的主要催化剂。我在 Atom/Osmo LP 中有一部分头寸，并拥有一部分 Atom，但随着该提案接近通过，将寻求添加其他头寸。\n去中心化交易所\ndYdX\n\n非常简单的理论设计，吸引了从中心化交易所迁移的资金，属于当前最赚钱的衍生品 DEX；\nJOE\n\n已成为最好的自动做市商（AMM）之一 ，其市值将在短时间内逼近 UNI & SUSHI；\nOSMO\n\n更像小且人们不知道的项目，但身为 Cosmos 上的主要 AMM，其运行良好，随着人们对 IBC 的了解越来越多，应该会得到更多使用；\nNINJA\n\n微小盘， Solana DEX / NFT / 链游，如果团队执行得力，其市值天花板不可限量；\nDPX\n\n去中心化期权协议，目前处于测试网阶段，但我认为他们在这一板块中没有太多竞争力；\n鉴于其市值仍不过 1-2 亿美元，还是很好的循环投资标的\nAstroport \\[即将推出\\]\n\nColumbus-5 升级后将成为 LUNA 平台的主要 AMM，目前尚未推出。\n多链 / 桥项目\nSYN\n\n这一领域中用户目前正在不同链上追逐最佳机会，快速且易于使用的「桥」会是非常有用的利器；\nSynapse 是从 Arbitrum 快速取回资金的少数途径之一，并且它们也具有与其他链互动的功能 + 将进行更多构建；\nSCRT\n\nSecret Network 是我在主网上看到的第一个以隐私为主打卖点的智能合约协议。他们即将推出的 Supernova 协议更新将实现 IBC 整合，类似于 LUNA 的 Columbus-5 更新。其币价走势图接近其囤积低点范围，因此主力已经开始在这里建仓，应该会过一段时间人们才会开始谈论这一代币。\n该项目已经测试了「桥」从 ETH 兑换成 SCRT ，「桥」运行正常，但它们在桥接时不提供任何基础货币，因此您必须从某个地方获取它，之后才能取消隐藏您的资产。\nREN\n\n另一个「桥」 项目，原理等同于 SYN\n对冲 / 做空的项目\nDOGE\n\n一直是业绩表现最弱的标杆代币之一，散户关注的重心已从 meme 币转移到 NFT，其他链上的狗币中也可以看到这种衰落趋势。\nBNB\n\n其他 L1 的崛起，已经让很多人忘记了 BSC，BNB 仍然积极地 在 Pancake Swap / Bakery Swap 进行交易，但不像以前那样多，因为当时 BSC 是唯一廉价的以太坊替代链；\n我个人坚信，今年余下时间内，BNB 相对于 SOL / LUNA / AVAX 的颓势将继续延续。\nMATIC\n\n与做空 BNB 的理论类似，其他原因包括 Arbitrum 和其它即将登场的 ETH L2 解决方案发展如火如荼。\n收益耕种机会\nJEWEL / ONE\n\nHarmony 上的主力 DEX，目前尚未受到太多关注，他们也计划发行 NFT，以及打造使用 ONE 的链游；\n大部分回报锁定到明年 7 月，以抵消高 APR ；\n每个 epoch 的 APR 不断衰减，项目依然处于早期阶段；\n我个人见到的最具创造性的 DEX 之一，具备先发优势 + 与其他类似项目不同的体验。\nOSMO / ATOM\n\nOsmosis 是首批与 IBC 其余部分连接的链之一，Gravity DEX / mBridge 将能够在第四季度末将 IBC 连接到以太坊和其他生态系统；\nCosmos 上的第一个主要 AMM，很可能成为 Cosmos 生态系统中 Luna IBC 连接的主要受益者。\nNINJA / SOL\n\n我个人非常看好 Ninja 团队，因为他们打造了一个表现优异的 DEX，且正朝着打造 NFT 市场 + 整合链游而努力工作。\n其团队绝对拥有一整套发展路线图，但作为小盘资产，我认为其上涨潜力不俗 。\n在 Orca 和 Ninja 中获得双倍奖励，其资金池应该会继续持续约 365 天，且无需担心无常损失，因为代币对是 NINJA/SOL 而不是 NINJA/USDC。\n稳定币收益耕种农场\nRari Capital USDC Pool\n\n23% APR\n存入 $USDC ，依据其收益聚合策略而获取回报\nAnchor on Luna\n\n\\~20% APR\n存入 $UST\nOHM\n\n我了解到这个项目真的已经很晚了，但他们已经将大约 1.5 亿美元投入到其金库中，并拥有一个致力于长期发展的用户社区；\n由于其市值现在超过 10 亿美元，我认为对多数人（比如我）而言，很难忽视这一项目，其代币会在这一基础上继续加速上行；\n观察一下 Olympus Pro 推出后的运行情况会很有趣，但老实说，这个项目会飞得更高\n这一唯一的利空因素是：其市值相比金库总资产的溢价现在相当大 。\n单边质押\nxJewel\n\nDPX\n\nNFT\nPunks\n\n鉴于 ETH 表现良好，Punks 应该会继续上涨。您可能不会再因为购买这些 Punks 而获得 100 倍的收益，但它们本质上就像在以太坊上购买房地产一样；\n如果此时购买这些 Punks，我个人认为，您应该计划多年持有。\nBAYC\n\n很明显是 NFT 板块中仅次于 Punks、排名第二的项目，从投资回报率的角度来看有点类似，您如果甘冒较大风险挖掘中间梯队项目，可能会获得更多收益，但 BAYC 将保持价值，这是毫无置疑的。\nSMB\n\nSolana 上人气最高的 NFT，我认为其定价最终将接近于 BYAC；\n我认为，在当前价格基础上，在短期内涨势会放缓一点，因为其地板价刚刚从 50 → 250 SOL，但从整个 NFT 格局来看，它是最可靠的选择；\n作为 Solana 上主要的 PFP NFT，相比以太坊上同类项目而言其价格被低估。\nCreatures\n\n拥有强大的社区，并与现实生活中的艺术家建立了出色的人脉关系；\n持币者人数与代币总数之比 \\~55% + 「大鲨鱼」奥尼尔等名人加入社区；\n相对于其他相同质量项目 \\~3 ETH 左右的地板价，其价格仍然相对便宜；\n我个人持有其中一些稀有品，真的不打算很快出售，认为这些是目前 PFP 项目中上涨潜力最大的项目。\nLoomlock NFT\n\nLoom 的生态项目；\n预期该项目会具有持久力，并且除了 JPG 之外还有更多的东西转化为 NFT，我认为，Loom 在培养社区和增加价值方面会做得很好；\n我通过铸造得到了一些 Loomlock NFT， 可能会在二级市场购买更多。\n0N1 Forces\n\n这是我个人从美学上最钟爱的 NFT 项目，其中几张头像我可能会长期保留一段时间；\n我对交易 0N1 Forces NFT 不是很感兴趣，但在我的 PFP 之外还有该项目一些其他的 NFT，如果他们的盘子变得很大，我可能会转入其他较小的项目；\n10 月第一周在洛杉矶为 0N1 持币者举行首次线下面对面聚会；\n其作品在第四季度会有空投。\nFTM 上的 Bit Umans / Ancestral Umans / Portalheads\n\n对 Fantom 上发布的首批 NFT 之一进行廉价赌注，对这些项目的信念并不高，但考虑到那里没有太多竞争，认为投资回报率是不错的。\nAVAX 上的 Crypto Seals\n\n在人们刚开始聚集时，我铸造了一些此类 NFT，与 FTM 上的操作理念相同，这是 AVAX 上最早的生成项目之一，并且几乎没有任何铸造成本。\nHarmony 上的 Gen 0 Heroes\n\n这些将与 DeFi Kingdoms DEX 一起发布，希望在它们出现时铸造一些，因为它们还可以让您更早地解锁收益耕种奖励，并且将成为 Harmony 上第一个值得注意的 NFT。\nArweave\n\nArweave 是最好的 NFT 基础设施项目，其去中心化数据存储架构将支持未来的很多 NFT 项目，这些项目希望将数据存储在 AWS 或其他中心化服务以外的其他地方。与 Filecoin 等其他数据存储项目相比，它的市值仍然被低估 。\n我个人持有很多其他项目代币，但这些是我主要的赌注，每周都有一个带有 NFT 概念的新项目浮出水面，因此可能会继续跟踪其交易额 + 销售趋势，只是为了抓住这些机会\n其他\n\n我对大多数 NFT 项目的了解，不如我对替代币生态系统的那么了如指掌，因此需要对这一板块做更多的研究，需要更仔细地研究：项目如何向用户进行空投并启动新的迭代\n例如 <https://cyberkongz.medium.com/the-next-leap-in-cyberkongz-evolution-e8ea8a064b26>\n元宇宙项目\nAxie Infinity\n\nAXS 是当前链游领域无可匹敌的领导者。在市场其他部分价格触底之前，它是第一个从 6 月份低点强力反弹的山寨币，并且已经巩固盘整了几个月。\n他们的仍在为用户提供价值，即使是与包括所有 DeFi 替代币的协议相比，仍然是利润最为丰厚的协议。他们即将推出的质押应该是一个很好的催化剂，为下一个趋势走势铺平道路。\nAXS 的主要风险是随着它的人气不断爆棚，它如何处理扩展到更多用户的问题，我想要更深入研究他们对此有何计划。\nVulcan\n\nPYR 是我研究过的低市值游戏项目之一。老实说，对它我还没有像我对其他游戏那样深入研究，但他们正在构建一个完整的 NFT DApp 生态系统和 NFT 市场。我玩过其中一些游戏，从技术分析来看，其币价走势图表看起来很棒。\n对明年的整体随想\n问题一：所有资产大跌 90%、出现多年熊市的可能性有多大？\n\n我个人认为，随着加密资产的人气变得越来越高，这种情况越来越不可能发生，因为我们看到，当前流入加密领域的资金 / 用户超过以往任何时期。我认为，有太多被搁置的资金和积极的开发活动，导致价格不可能多年出现连续多年的跌跌不休。\n我们看到今年衍生品溢价 / 未平仓合约（OI）过热+泡沫破灭，这些都下跌了约 70+%，但之后我们只是横盘整理了三个月，然后又回升。由于替代币资产以如此快的速度变成抛物线，因此价格回撤通常非常陡峭。\n自加密货币诞生以来的任何其他阶段，都没有发生这种情况，因为加密货币现在受到了公众的广泛关注，所以我相信，2022 年不会再度触及 2021 年创下的低点。必须发生类似新冠肺炎疫情这样几十年一次的打击事件，才可能导致这种情况，导致严重的崩盘。我相信如果市场再次过热，-70% 回撤+ 再次横盘是可能的，但我认为在更大幅的上涨之前，不太可能出现这种情况。由于 SBF 的公众形象，以及他一再积极地强调希望与监管机构合作，FTX 会成为核心话题，并吸引公众视野的关注，这对加密货币来说是一个巨大的福音，这也是我认为 SOL 比其他 L1 具有优势的另一个原因。从发展角度、公众认知角度、制度角度或监管角度而言，现在再将 2017 年与 2021 年进行比较是没有意义的。\n加密作为一种资产类别的成熟，意味着只要经济健康，加密资产最终应该开始与标普 500 指数一起上涨，加密的上涨空间比目前任何其他资产类别都要大得多，但即使它的规模已经赶上其它资产类别，正如我们在 FAANG 等公司中看到的那样，加密仍可实现稳定增长。我相信，随着人们希望收获超越传统市场的利润，我们将会看到越来越多的机构 / 对冲基金进入加密领域，负责为高净值人士投资的专业人士必然会被问到：为什么他们没有对加密货币进行配资，这意味着：加密资产的波动性应该在未来几年开始收窄。\n问题二：什么将成为 2020 年代的杀手级应用？ 2010 年代是亚马逊、2000 年代初是 Facebook，在元宇宙领域中会是什么样子的应用？如何吸引数以百万的非加密用户？\n\n这是我经常回顾的问题之一，因为它帮助我在更长的时间框架内构想想法。我打赌，未来十年用户会涌入加密领域，将带来用户与技术交互方式的重大转变。\n例如， 一个元宇宙 / 社交网络中，人们拥有一个包含所有 NFT/ 艺术 / 数字土地 / 炫耀性（Flex）物品的公共地址；一个可以轻松用作储蓄账户的私人地址，利用 USDC / UST 等稳定币产生收益；一个用于 DEX 交易 / 其他交易的私人地址。所有这些都通过没有差别的用户体验实现连接，人们可以在其中相互发送消息。这个方面，值得思考的问题是：\n如何在一个地方创建包含社交网络 / 银行 / 游戏的无缝体验？\n能在什么平台上构建它？\n将如何向新用户和数百万人推广这一应用？（通过）游戏化？（通过） NFT？\n问题三：哪个没有讨论到的细分市场会在未来几个月 / 明年人气爆棚？\n\n如果 2018 年问这个问题，答案是 DeFi；\n如果 2019 年问这个问题， 答案是 NFT\n我不确定下一个主要趋势是什么，但也经常重新思考这个问题。\n总之，更泛泛而言，我想要花时间更详细了解 L1 技术堆栈之间的差异。我的大部分时间都花在加密交易和开发上，所以我想在有时间的时候平衡一下。",

{"id": "JGAawuLbmR8KRpgI1zaacYL-oQY0uzjObYxLp2MgKek", "title": "Sobre redes distribuidas", "body": "El futuro no pertenece a las redes centralizadas, el futuro pertenece a las redes distribuidas; y esto, que es válido para las redes informáticas, es también válido para las redes humanas, incluidas, naturalmente,las de gobierno, las legislativas, las jurídicas y, naturalmente, las de los abogados. Sin embargo aún estamos en el albor de las técnicas que permiten que las redes distribuidas se impongan a las caducas redes jerarquizadas de forma que, ese futuro del que les hablo, será tanto más cercano o lejano cuanto más pronto o más tarde los seres humanos aprendan a dominar las tecnologías que lo permiten.\n\nHoy, que me he levantado temprano, me he dedicado a explorar una de esas iniciativas distribuidas que me gustan, una cadena de bloques (un \"blockchain\") llamado \"Arweave\" y que promete almacenar eternamente los contenidos depositados en él.\n\nLa promesa es fuerte (los abogados y abogadas mejor que nadie sabemos cuán débiles son las promesas \"para siempre\"), pero sus promotores la justifican matemáticamente de forma tan compleja como convincente y, además, la forma en que pretenden llevarla a cabo encaja exactamente con las estrategias de red distribuida (de hecho en el siglo XXI ya nadie -salvo nuestro políticos- peinsa de otra forma). Déjenme que me explique.\n\nQuizá no hayan ustedes oído hablar nunca del telescopio de Arecibo de forma que, aquellos que sí lo conocen, permítanme un párrafo para explicar a los que no que el radiotelescopio de Arecibo fue el mayor telescopio jamás construido gracias a sus 305 metros de diámetro, hasta la construcción del RATAN-600 (Rusia) con su antena circular de 576 metros de diámetro. Uno de sus usos (quizá el más conocido) fue buscar señales de radio o de vida extraterrestre. Si sienten curiosidad búsquenlo en internet y, ahora que sabemos lo que fue el telescopio de Arecibo, déjenme que les cuente una historia.\n\nLos científicos a cargo del telescopio se dieron cuenta que, debido a su tremendo tamaño, el telescopio recogía ingentes cantidades de datos para cuyo procesamiento se precisaba una tremenda capacidad de computación y, una de las soluciones que pensaron, ilustra perfectamente lo que quiero decir cuando les hablo de redes distribuidas. Los científicos responsables de Arecibo, en lugar de pensar en comprar un montón de ordenadores para procesar datos simplemente fabricaron un software para ejecutar protectores de pantalla, pero de una forma especial. Cuando un ciudadano dejaba de utilizar su ordenador se ponía en marcha el protector de pantalla programado por estos científicos y, a partir de ese momento, el ordenador que estaba parado y sin su dueño delante cedía su capacidad de procesamiento a los responsables del telescopio de Arecibo. Muchos miles de personas participaron de forma altruista en este proyecto y eso permitió el procesado de enormes cantidades de datos que, de otra forma, hubiese sido imposible procesar.\n\nSETI@home (\"SETI at home\", \"SETI en casa\" en inglés), fue el nombre que se dio al proyecto del que les hablo y fue un proyecto de computación distribuida que funcionaba (y funciona) en la plataforma informática Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC), desarrollado por el Space Sciences Laboratory, en la Universidad de California en Berkeley (Estados Unidos). SETI es un acrónimo en inglés para Search for extraterrestrial intelligence (Búsqueda de inteligencia extraterrestre). Su propósito es analizar señales de radio buscando señales de inteligencia extraterrestre y es una de las muchas actividades llevadas a cabo como parte de SETI.\n\nPues bien, ahora que saben qué es SETI permítanme que les pregunte: ¿qué renimiento o provecho producen los miles de ordenadores existentes en las diversas administraciones y qu permanecen apagados ocho o dieciséis horas al día? ¿a nadie se le ha ocurrido una mejor forma de aprovechar su capacidad de computación o almacenamiento?\n\nLos responsables de la blockchain de que les hablo esta mañana (Arweave) parten de una idea muy similar a la de SETI pero, en lugar de compartir capacidad de procesamiento, se centran en la capacidad de almacenamiento. Todos nosotros disponemos de recursos de almacenamiento de datos que no usamos (espacio libre en tus discos duros por ejemplo) ¿por qué no preparar un software -blockchain- que permita a los ususarios compartir su espacio de almacenamiento sobrante para archivar en él datos ajenos?\n\nLa complejidad del proyecto es importante. Además de la necesaria infraestructura de cadena de bloques es preciso que los datos a almacenar permanezcan cifrados e inaccesibles para su anfitrión el cual, maravillas del blockchai, recibirá en compensación por el servicio prestado unos tokens (criptomonedas) que retribuirán su compromiso con el proyecto.\n\nDe momento convertir a su ordenador en un nodo más de esa red no es un trabajo al alcance de cualquiera, es complejo y, como primera providencia, es preciso que cambie usted de sistema operativo e instale Linux en vez de Windows, algo que -con Arweave o sin Arweave- debería usted hacer antes temprano que tarde, algo a lo que le estimulo encarecidamente.\n\nToda esta largísima introducción me sirve para decirles que ya hay plataforma de blogging que permiten colocar sus post sobre arweave de forma que duren \"para siempre\" (e incluso convertirlos en token NFT) y eso es lo que acabo de hacer esta mañana. He echado un vistazo a los muchísimos post que, desde 2010 llevo escritos sobre a abogacía y los abogados, y he elegido uno al azar para publicar mi primer post \"inmortal\". Quizá no se vea tan bonito como en mi plataforma wordpress pero, ciertamente, la filosofía que se oculta tras la plataforma que ahora lo sustentan es de las que harán cambiar el mundo y la visión de la sociedad que tenemos los seres humanos.\n\nLes dejo el link.\n\n<https://acortar.link/1GoX5w>", "timestamp": 1633763268, "digest": "7Lxm4ji0Akus8MaT5_1xiZ1xQzqgzEQWZ5Ct-7gXnIs", "contributor": "0xb5bF77b790f8185a6968F0B26f7Ff2610c1aAe42"}

They had nothing to say or do. One of the managed to break the silence. One thing led to another and then this happened!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*AiUfoz1DVhG30udu352kOg.png)\n\n### What did the designer say?\n\nOne of the designers shared an observation about our nearest and dearest chai vendor. Each morning, he would painstakingly broom away cigarette butts off the pavement. All because people wouldn’t use a bin to dispose of their cigarettes.\n\nLooked like the designers had found themselves a problem to solve—one that wasn’t commissioned by a client. *Oh, sweet creative freedom!*\n\n## The Stakeout! 👀 👀\n\nThe designers planted themselves into the scene. They observed how customers interacted with the space. Here’s what they saw:\n\n* Customers usually bought *chai & sutta* (cigarette) together\n* They would finish the chai and throw the cups into the bin\n* They would throw the cigarettes butts on the ground and put them out with their feet\n* ***They would leave the butts behind on the ground***\n\nOnce a butt was on the ground, nobody made an effort to pick it back up. But the very same customers dumped the chai cups into the bin. So this wasn’t due to ignorance. There had to be some other reason!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*zjBa-6fy-2lk_OeDwPaOXA.png)\n\n> The designers *hypothesised* that customers were merely avoiding a fire hazard\n\nThrowing lit cigarettes into a bin full of paper cups isn’t a bright idea, after all. The designers decided to take it up as a design challenge to help avoid throwing cigarettes onto the ground in the first place.\n\n## The Problem Statement\n\n> How might we provide customers a better way to put out cigarettes?\n\nIn an indoor setting, one might use an ashtray. Could the designers make a public ashtray? One that customers can use to put out cigarettes and then safely dispose of the butts into bins? ***They had an idea! 💡*️**\n\nThey ran around the office looking for raw materials and tools to create a prototype. The best they could manage was a wooden plank.\n\n![Notice how pink Einstein's tongue is](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wjw85H5PllGxpeKDQmH3U.png?height=1315&width=1352)\n\nThe designers hoped a giant ashtray with Einstein’s face on it would grab customers’ attention and appeal to their scientific sensibilities.\n\n## Installing the prototype\n\n*Einstein* was ready. They found some light rope to tie the plank to a nearby lamp post. It turned out to be a tricky task. They\n\nstruggled to mount *Einstein* — it kept sliding off. The customers looked in wonder and confusion as the designers hung their heads low.\n\n## ***Deus ex machina! 👼***\n\nTwo carpenters working in the basement of an adjacent building noticed the struggle. They volunteered to help. They took *Einstein* into their workspace and drilled holes. This helped balance the plank as they tied it to a lamp post.\n\n![Humans ❤](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*LyFI6kNL0DuXWnGC8bKiLg.png)\n\n## The Results\n\nThe designers installed the prototype and simply waited.

The rest of his face was quite intact. There was no vandalism of any kind, nor did anybody steal the plank — this was a huge win!\n\n## It didn’t end there\n\nPositive results inspired the designers to come back and improve the design. They started working on 2 new prototypes. They also identified another chai vendor in the vicinity to recreate the experiment.\n\n![“What client meeting?”](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*A40F9AAp-AzgP0qdYG6eHg.png)\n\n### Prototype 1: Improvements\n\nThey first sought to improve the original design. The new prototype was\n\n* more compact in form,\n* sturdier as it was made of metal, and\n* more noticeable and more readable due to the contrast between the bright orange and pitch black colours\n\n![The plank now supports the improved prototype!](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*yBPXmZqCrIi7zxs5P1PRbA.png?&&)\n\nThe result with this prototype were consistent with that of Einstein’s. The metal mesh got darker and darker with each passing day — a sign of its increasing usage.\n\n### Prototype 2: New form factor\n\nThe biggest drawback with the Einstein was that it had to be hung. They explored a new form factor that stood on its own.

{"id": "3JKQbr6wIiQiBhD3N5f9AifF8Gzu8Er77E_oK49kR14", "title": "Mirror.xyz对外开放后，我应该在上面发布什么内容？", "body": "作为Web3领域的标志性应用，社交媒体平台Mirror.xyz终于对外开放了，现在任何拥有以太坊账户的人都可以在上面撰写文章或发表其他形式更丰富的内容。\n\n但是我应该在上面做哪些尝试呢？或许应该先从关键词「Web3」开始思考，这是Mirror.xyz与其他社交媒体平台完全不同的地方。\n\nWeb3作为一个前沿的概念，大家对于这个词的认知还是有很多分歧的，大致包含几种观点，比如「用户掌握自己的数据所有权」、「自由与开放/开源」、「去中心化」、「抗审查」等。而恰巧这些特点也可以通过区块链技术实现，所以Web3很多时候都和区块链技术有着非常强的绑定。\n\n具体来说，DeFi（去中心化金融）被加密货币社区认为是Web3在金融场景上的一种实现，在过去两年间它证明了拥有Web3的「可组合性」优势，其整体的效率和发展速度可以远超传统行业。另一个类似案例则是NFT标准在今年的大规模应用，让大量的数字化资产通过区块链网络流转，为新一代的基础网络提供了更丰富多样的资产种类。\n\n> DeFi第一次让Web3用户感受到「可组合性」的魅力，而在金融场景之外，Mirror很可能是Web3 影响更广泛Web2用户群体的重要阵地。\n\nMirror.xyz最令人兴奋的地方在于，它组合了多个区块链网络的优势：无需许可账户系统、永久存储、功能可扩展性等，但还能保持Web2级别的用户体验。毕竟还有大量用户尚未使用过加密货币或Web3平台，但是大多数互联网用户都用过博客或社交平台。\n\n正因为如此，作为一个泛用型的社交媒体平台，加密货币相关的内容应该只是Mirror.xyz的一个子集，而且占比越低越代表了Mirror的发展更健康。\n\n### 别再写Crypto的内容了！\n\nMirror不是为加密货币行业定制的平台，它适合更广泛的内容创作者或者普通人。\n\n所以哪怕Mirror的早期用户可能有大量加密货币行业的从业者，而且早期内容还是会大量关注于加密货币行业的发展，但创作者完全可以利用这个平台逐渐替代传统的博客或者内容网站，所以并不存在内容题材上的限制。\n\n或许可以从Crypto逐渐扩展至泛科技、技术、艺术或者其他更垂直领域的内容，甚至也可以将其作为一个最普通的博客，记录那些你个人的东西，比如新的想法、认知或者是当作日记。\n\n### 探索机构和团队账户的场景\n\n除了适合个人开设Mirror账号之外，机构、团队、组织、DAO也可以利用Mirror的特点，发布项目进展、披露公开信息、发布研究报告，甚至是借助Web3组件实现拍卖、公募等金融业务。\n\n如果从Crypto行业内来看，很多团队都在使用Medium、微信公众号、Twitter、Substack等平台公开项目进展的信息，这部分的内容完全可以用Mirror来替代，同时可以拥有内容永久存储、无法被平台运营方审查、可集成多样化的功能（比如金融）等各种优势。\n\n而在Crypto行业外，同样有这些需求，而且随着NFT和DAO的概念不断进入传统领域，Mirror的优势可以很快显现出来。\n\n### 永存的内容，再也不担心审查和丢失\n\n永久存储真的是一个非常「可怕」的承诺，可能有人并不喜欢这个设定，但的确有太多的公共领域信息或私密信息可以在永久存储技术的帮助下，为人类实现一个公用数据库。\n\n在此之前互联网世界里的永久存储是交给一个名为Internet Archive的非营利组织实现的，也有一些第三方的服务可以提供类似功能，但这些通过信任第三方的机制不如区块链技术可靠，因为后者是可以通过技术手段和网络共识确保永存的。\n\nMirror目前采用的是Arweave区块链实现内容的永存，不过随着Arweave网络的成熟和更多去中心化存储网络的兴起，总会有越来越好用的技术可以被Mirror集成。\n\n所以对于Mirror的用户来说，内容因为硬件故障丢失或者被政府机构审查删除的情况就不用担心了，所有内容都会安全的存放在Arweave上。哪怕未来Mirror的前端会适应各地法律而不得不进行审查，也是没关系的，因为Arweave网络中总会储存该内容，而且会被Arweave的大量节点冗余备份。\n\n也期待Mirror可以将入口、域名解析、数据传输层迁移至去中心化的网络，这样也就彻底无法被审查了。\n\n### 体验Web3的「可组合性」\n\n永存之外，Mirror的另一个魅力就是强大的功能扩展性，可以从体验Mirror上集成的Web3控件开始。\n\nMirror的[编辑指南](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/editor)显示，目前已经支持了在文章嵌入各种多媒体或者其他功能模块，包括：\n\n* NFT展示（以太坊）\n* 众筹模块\n* 拍卖模块\n* 图片\n* 链接及预览\n* Twitter预览\n* 视频类多媒体（Youtube或自托管）\n* 其他框架（比如WebGL的可交互内容）\n\n除此之外，Mirror还有不少功能尚未完全对外开放，比如拍卖模块、代币竞赛模块等。\n\nMirror本身作为一个开放的社区，也开放了Discord频道，所有人都可以去社区参与讨论，提出产品改进建议，每个人都可以参与Mirror的共建。\n\n### 不想从零开始？试试看一键迁移\n\n对于使用其他传统博客或者媒体平台的个人或者项目团队而言，Mirror也开发了迁移功能，可以将Medium或Substack等平台中的内容完全迁移至Mirror中。导入的内容将会被转换为Markdown格式，这也是很多平台默认支持的文本编辑语法。\n\n这样导入过来的内容也可以借助Mirror集成Arweave的永存特性，也相当于做了内容的备份，而对于新的内容则可以借助上述Mirror的其他特性。\n\n### 最重要的是：释放想象力！\n\n虽然很多时候会将Mirror类比为博客或社交媒体平台，但这种思维定势或许会束缚创作者的想象力。\n\n我认为从根本上来说，Mirror是有望为内容创作者提供一个多元化的平台，通过提供各种各样的工具（支付、众筹、版税），既可以打通创作者和粉丝之间的连接，还能寻找适合自己的经济模式或收入来源。\n\n比如已经有电影制作公司通过Mirror的众筹模块募资，然后为资助的用户空投对应的代币和NFT，作为一种纪念。（[Ethereum: The Infinite Garden](https://ethereumfilm.mirror.xyz/3SV8gLXHIW8Ot45h3RL7aOgDINxN2hjLfFVOvyatB2A)）\n\n另外，内容创作者也能通过「众筹模块」获取资助，然后进行各种形式的创作，比如深度研究、行业报告、产品体验、艺术创作，或者也可以利用「拍卖模块」出售内容、广告、作品等。\n\n还有更多我现在也无法想象出的用例。\n\n### Web3时代很快就要来了！\n\n除了内容平台Mirror之外，其他类的Web3应用也在很快发展。\n\n> 比如，NFT标准可以扩张Web3的资产类别，Radicle探索开发者协作工具，EthSign专注电子签名，Meson和Theta解决去中心化的流量分发，Livepeer和Golem提供计算网络，ENS和DAS提供身份和域名解析，Gitcoin和CLRFund解决公共物品资助难题。\n\n而这些应用也证明了一件事：区块链不仅可以实现DeFi业务，还能成为这些Web3组件不可或缺的基础设施。", "timestamp": 1633764257, "digest": "btn7xS_S3ADrRFzB9olhVlaNKDDzbyPLZ7FKsLZgHWI", "contributor": "0x3035A1bBd824041B07f8Ab2297a71A81E00127c5"}

{"id": "fp9LWLVlPCw2Of0HMgXGjbnhdyA0yOhfrvt45bme7vc", "title": "关于EDEN 确定性陷阱与项目本身", "body": "前一阵子，一个叫做EDEN的新项目出现在市场里，是MEV赛道的新秀。币价也从1刀多的低点一路上涨到9刀以上，而且随着项目的发展，越来越多的利好都开始出现：锁仓量增长、投资方豪华、项目发展好等等都开始出现，也有越来越多的人参与其中。但是买入的人其实都掉入了一个确定性陷阱，今天我想聊聊这个。\n\n一个项目币价的上涨，其实是一系列复杂因素的结果。比如AXE精妙的经济模型、DYDX强大的激励机制。都是币价上涨这个结果的重要支撑。但是拥有这些东西的项目也不少，但是我们不能忽视的因素还有很多：项目方靠谱、项目热门、项目有价值、赛道好、投资方强、经济模型合理、群众基础好、有庄家拉盘、有暴富效应、运气等等。即使全部拥有，仍然需要天时地利人和，才能达成暴富神话。毕竟币圈几万个项目，一个牛市中能成为明星的两只手可能就数的明白。\n\n任何人都无法围绕所有的维度做细致的考察研究，很多时候都是靠简单的体感去做判断。比如EDEN这个项目，大多数人可能都和我一样，非常看重其强大的投资方背景，又受到sol、ftt等项目的暴涨神话影响，认为eden将会是下一个。但这其实是搞混了充分和必要的关系，的确，暴涨的币大多是这些明星投资方投的，但它们投了没涨的项目更多。也就是说明星投资方是暴涨这个结果的必要条件，而非充分条件.\n\n在这样的错误认知下，很多人就头脑简单的梭哈了eden，但这里面还有一层，就是低估了确定性的代价。在币圈的投资里，能够拍胸脯说“确定能涨”的大概只有大饼和姨太，这个确定性是用时间证明的，是用低赔率换来的。当你只希望短期内能达成几十倍的暴富而选择eden后，它怎么可能有高确定性呢？如果有，那岂不是成了数学期望值最高的选择了么？那么市场的所有人就都会来，而不可能是现状。\n\n既然你选择了eden，其实就是选择了风险。这个项目可能会失败，不涨的可能性也是不小的。也因此仓位不适宜放的太大。这是世界的数学本质决定的。而且也从来没有一个项目，能够在上线后就长期上涨，让所有人都盈利的。只有当少数人相信时，它才更可能涅槃重生，成为一个明星项目。我也同样相信eden是一个好赛道和好项目，也因此静静的坐在车上等待。但是我也同样承担着一旦项目没有起色，错过大牛市的代价。这个代价，是否适合所有人，当然是每一位参与者，需要细细考量的。\n\n链闻里有一篇文章是关心eden的人应该看一看的，题目如下，自己搜索。《详解 Eden Network：诱惑、不公和缺陷之外谁是赢家，谁是输家？》\n\n这篇文章简单聊了MEV赛道和EDEN的事情，简单来说，以太坊区块打包时的排序原来是看GAS也就是手续费高低的，GAS越高就越优先，但这也带来了一些“科学家”欺负散户的问题。EDEN的原理是和打包以太坊区块的算力合作，通过一些补偿手段让算力优先打包接入EDEN的交易。散户只需要质押100个起的EDEN就可以参与到这个系统来。\n\n但是现在的问题是，这些算力对EDEN并没有太强的支持，由于EDEN本身的设计，导致算力始终可以灵活切换模式，去挖掘利益最大的区块，而不是忠实于EDEN，导致对EDEN的支持并不够。而且算力收到EDEN后也倾向于清仓卖出，导致市场抛压很大，这其中EDEN项目方不对算力设置锁仓和权重限制的操作也堪称牛逼。在这个小生态里，身法灵活且白嫖的算力是赢家，项目方无中生有也是赢家，真正的输家是投资EDEN的散户，尤其是高位接盘的，恐怕是最难受的。\n\n前一阵子支持EDEN的算力比例已经达到50%以上，也就是说整个以太坊系统中有一半以上的算力都接入了EDEN系统，理论上支持EDEN优先。但最近星火矿池的关闭是影响很大的，算力比例跌到了现在的36%左右，这件事是很要命的，因为EDEN最核心的价值指标就是支持的算力比例，如果是100%，那么所有算力都优先打包使用EDEN的交易，所有人都需要它，都需要更多的它、EDEN的价值就是巨大的。一旦这个指标上不去，EDEN也就成了可有可无的产品，它的技术路线也就有被取代的风险。\n\n即使有很多的不利因素，EDEN依然处于一个好赛道，是一个好项目。项目方依然有很多工作可以做，很多内容可以优化。只要能把经济模型做的再合理一些，然后接入更多的算力。那么这个诸多光环加持的项目就依然是充满希望的。\n\n币圈素来有炒新不炒旧的传统，对于MEV这个没有炒作过的、确实具有真金白银的赛道，也依然有着巨大的潜力。这也是我对于EDEN情有独钟的原因之一吧。\n\n利益相关：本人持有EDEN代币", "timestamp": 1633764050, "digest": "ELvdwsJRrscsv62ueb4TdaKsUQ9_GJPO4h6gUe-9JQ0", "contributor": "0x8A2cC05FEa3d506985d0d77506D6c5D8df6F5FA1"}

They had nothing to say or do. One of the managed to break the silence. One thing led to another and then this happened!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*AiUfoz1DVhG30udu352kOg.png)\n\n### What did the designer say?\n\nOne of the designers shared an observation about our nearest and dearest chai vendor. Each morning, he would painstakingly broom away cigarette butts off the pavement. All because people wouldn’t use a bin to dispose of their cigarettes.\n\nLooked like the designers had found themselves a problem to solve—one that wasn’t commissioned by a client. *Oh, sweet creative freedom!*\n\n## The Stakeout! 👀 👀\n\nThe designers planted themselves into the scene. They observed how customers interacted with the space. Here’s what they saw:\n\n* Customers usually bought *chai & sutta* (cigarette) together\n* They would finish the chai and throw the cups into the bin\n* They would throw the cigarettes butts on the ground and put them out with their feet\n* ***They would leave the butts behind on the ground***\n\nOnce a butt was on the ground, nobody made an effort to pick it back up. But the very same customers dumped the chai cups into the bin. So this wasn’t due to ignorance. There had to be some other reason!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*zjBa-6fy-2lk_OeDwPaOXA.png)\n\n> The designers *hypothesised* that customers were merely avoiding a fire hazard\n\nThrowing lit cigarettes into a bin full of paper cups isn’t a bright idea, after all. The designers decided to take it up as a design challenge to help avoid throwing cigarettes onto the ground in the first place.\n\n## The Problem Statement\n\n> How might we provide customers a better way to put out cigarettes?\n\nIn an indoor setting, one might use an ashtray. Could the designers make a public ashtray? One that customers can use to put out cigarettes and then safely dispose of the butts into bins? ***They had an idea! 💡*️**\n\nThey ran around the office looking for raw materials and tools to create a prototype. The best they could manage was a wooden plank.\n\n![Notice how pink Einstein’s tongue is](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*h4QCZ1kZtp5ol1wF0W1VPA.png)\n\nThe designers hoped a giant ashtray with Einstein’s face on it would grab customers’ attention and appeal to their scientific sensibilities.\n\n## Installing the prototype\n\n\\*Einstein \\*was ready. They found some light rope to tie the plank to a nearby lamp post. It turned out to be a tricky task. They struggled to mount *Einstein* — it kept sliding off. The customers looked in wonder and confusion as the designers hung their heads low.\n\n### Deus ex machina! 👼\n\nTwo carpenters working in the basement of an adjacent building noticed the struggle. They volunteered to help. They took *Einstein* into their workspace and drilled holes. This helped balance the plank as they tied it to a lamp post.\n\n![Humans ❤](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*LyFI6kNL0DuXWnGC8bKiLg.png)\n\n## The Results\n\nThe designers installed the prototype and simply waited. They hoped people would\n\n1. Notice the plank\n2. Understand what its purpose is\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*a0DWEFwpoKN8BnwmyIOISQ.png)\n\n*Einstein’s* tongue got darker with each passing day. The rest of his face was quite intact. There was no vandalism of any kind, nor did anybody steal the plank — this was a huge win!\n\n## It didn’t end there\n\nPositive results inspired the designers to come back and improve the design. They started working on 2 new prototypes. They also identified another chai vendor in the vicinity to recreate the experiment.\n\n![“What client call?”](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*A40F9AAp-AzgP0qdYG6eHg.png)\n\n### Prototype 1: Improvements\n\nThey first sought to improve the original design. The new prototype was\n\n* more compact in form,\n* sturdier as it was made of metal, and\n* more noticeable and more readable due to the contrast between the bright orange and pitch black colours\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*yBPXmZqCrIi7zxs5P1PRbA.png)\n\nThe plank now supports the improved prototype!\n\nThe result with this prototype were consistent with that of Einstein’s. The metal mesh got darker and darker with each passing day — a sign of its increasing usage.\n\n### Prototype 2: New form factor\n\nThe biggest drawback with the Einstein was that it had to be hung. They explored a new form factor that stood on its own. Say hello to *Smoky!*\n\n![Smoky was modelled after a cigarette 🚬](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*9KxTaeq3qYU-nTWSjCvHMA.png)\n\n**Both prototypes were successful** and remained in their original locations for months. The designers have since then parted ways and have not been able to check in on *Einstein & Smoky*. But they like to think all is well!\n\n\n---\n\nThank you for reading this far.

{"id": "NthC52d0i5wfA_hovNjxNC8pqeqDAlzhN4rxtwV1L5w", "title": "陈辉阳：流行歌的古典魔法师", "body": "终于有机会聊聊陈辉阳了。6月25日，香港红馆将举办陈辉阳X女声合唱作品展《人来人往》，因为疫情一拖再拖的演出，终于有望举行，对歌迷和创作者来讲，都是一桩乐事。\n\n对了解陈辉阳过往创作的歌迷来讲，他的作品几乎每一首都是经典。有心人想必也会留意到，我的昵称其实也来自他的工作室名。\n\n从2016年起，陈辉阳与28人组成的“女声合唱团”，已经有过两次作品展。演出既没有大牌歌手，也没有炫目的舞台效果，只是黑白钢琴和极简的女声合唱。在这两次名为《少女的祈祷》和《上一次流泪》的演出中，包括如下曲目：黑夜不再来、Shall We Talk、日与夜、明日有明天、终身美丽、少女的祈祷、垃圾、暗涌、三千年前……哪一首拿出来，都是上世纪末本世纪初的广东歌经典，值得大书特书。\n\n华语流行音乐，被人们分为民谣、摇滚、电子、独立等风格。如若用上二胡、古筝和五声音阶，人们会贴上“中国风”或者民族风格。如果节奏强劲，则被分为舞曲。细究起来，欧美和日本在20世纪晚期的一些风格，比如Disco、R&B、Citypop、Trip-Hop、Rap甚至Jazz，我们也能在香港流行音乐找到对应的歌手、专辑和创作人。\n\n如果要用古典一词来给流行歌贴标签，恐怕只有陈辉阳一人有资格来独占这个分类了。\n\n在虾米（已关闭）、网易云音乐等App里，我们可以搜到和陈辉阳有关的歌单，有心人把他的许多作品和对应的古典音乐一一配对。\n\n歌名有直接对应关系的包括杨千嬅的《少女的祈祷》和陈奕迅的《给爱丽丝》（贝多芬名曲《Für Elise》）。\n\n《少女的祈祷》的创作过程早已成为一段佳话。1999年的圣诞节晚上，陈辉阳跟林夕晚饭后，在车上想到一个故事：“故事发生在巴士上，天阴，女孩在心里祷告，如果能顺利通过三盏交通灯都是绿灯的话，就永远和那个陌生男孩在一起。但巴士过了第二盏灯，男孩就下车了。”林夕就此写下了虔诚而伤心的歌词：……然而天父并未体恤好人/到我睁开眼 无明灯指引/我爱主 为何任我身边爱人/离弃了我 下了车 你怎可答允。\n\n而旋律的灵感则来自陈辉阳小时候弹奏过的古典乐曲、由波兰女作曲家巴达捷夫斯卡（Baranowska）创作的《少女的祈祷》钢琴曲《Modlitwa Dziewicy Op. 4》。\n\n另外一个不为人知的例子来自陈奕迅的《2001太空漫游》，这首华丽炫耀的电子音乐，陈辉阳的灵感素材来自施特劳斯（Richard Georg Strauss）的《查拉图斯特拉如时说》（Also sprach Zarathustra）。\n\n将古典音乐化为流行歌，这个事情看似美妙，实则很难。以钢琴曲为例，人声的音高区间、速度以及节奏，不论怎样高超，都很难跟上手指触摸键盘的那种曼妙跳跃。反过来说，陈辉阳创作的很多歌曲，如果改用钢琴和弦乐，或许更适合聆听。所以，在那些经典的人声K歌之外，我们还能找到许多用钢琴来演绎的版本。《声音变魔术》《与音乐谈情》《听入非非》三部曲就是以钢琴为主的陈辉阳作品集。\n\n在这方面，与同期的其他作曲人，比如雷颂德、Eric Kwok、伍乐城等相比，陈辉阳的作品显然更适合古典的音色，比如钢琴，比如女声合唱。\n\n因此，在远离流行音乐多年之后，近几年陈辉阳以另一种古典的方式重新出现在大众眼前。\n\n以女声合唱的方式呈现自己的作品，陈辉阳是受到了父亲陈振华的启发，也是一种致敬。陈振华是澳门儿童合唱团的指挥，2016年退休之际，他在澳门做了一场小型的告别仪式。在现场观看的陈辉阳突然来了灵感，他想要用唱诗班合唱的方式，让几十名女子的组合，来优美地演绎自己那一连串的K歌经典之作。不请明星，不用原唱者，陈辉阳转而向社会招募，凑成了28名女子合唱团。他们利用下班时间排练，一起磨合、研讨，筹备做一场简约朴素的“致敬青春回忆”的主题音乐会。\n\n以《暗涌》为例，这首陈辉阳的成名曲，以行云流水的钢琴演奏，情感起伏的女声合唱，着重音乐旋律本身，打动了很多人的心。听过女声合唱的观众说，“好治愈…好想流眼泪…我真的能感觉到台上女生悲伤的歌声是‘涌’向台下的！”\n\n二十八位年轻女生、两位钢琴演奏者和一个乐团指挥，构成了陈辉阳再次“圈粉”的班底。虽然近年来他的作品明显减少，但这一次的呈现方式变得更加精致。用唱诗班式的天籁之声重新演绎，给人耳目一新之感。在征服观众的同时，也征服了亚洲金曲奖各大评委。\n\n陈辉阳作品的古典气质，来自儿时和家庭的浸润。他在一次访问中说：“小时候的我只听古典音乐。有一次翻开爸爸的抽屉，看到一些录音卡带，当中有些以『串烧歌』形式出版的古典音乐。后来我发现那些音乐本来是很长的乐章，于是就把原装的逐一买回来。从小学四年级时便开始收集黑胶唱片、CD专辑，目前总数超过一万多张”。当时他对流行音乐不大感兴趣，反而对贝多芬、马勒、拉赫曼尼诺夫、利盖蒂（György Ligeti）、 武满彻、阿福·佩尔特等作曲家的作品特别喜爱。\n\n陈辉阳小时就读于澳门培正中学，之后在广州星海音乐学院学习钢琴，大学毕业于美国波士顿的伯克利音乐学院（Berklee College of Music）修读唱片录制、监制和录音工程。陈辉阳于1994年自美国返港后，便开始在录音公司担任录音工作。《明报香港乐坛四十年经典唱片》里评论：“陈辉阳可能是香港乐坛自顾嘉辉后一个能创出一种新曲风的作曲人而作品又能自成一个体系者。陈的西洋古典风流行曲跟顾的中式小调流行曲颇不相同。”\n\n我最早留意到陈辉阳的特殊气味，来自陈奕迅 的《黑夜不再来》。在茫茫流行歌中，这首歌是如此不同。在听过陈奕迅多个演唱会版本、钢琴演奏版本、女声合唱版本之后，我总有新的发现。真是一种历久弥新的体验。6/8拍子流淌出的旋律，是一种优雅的悲伤，仿佛双脚浸没在黑夜的海滩，任海风吹拂，任海水侵袭。\n\n《黑夜不再来》竟然已是20年前的作品，它本是林爱华导演的电影《十二夜》的片尾曲。这部电影有点法国新浪潮风格，说的是让人绝望的小情小爱。电影由发生在12个夜晚的故事组成。陈奕迅和张柏芝因为各自失恋而在一起，开始热络，后来变成斯德哥尔摩综合症，张柏芝对他越好，他就越不珍惜。林夕的歌词写道，“讨好我等于鼓励我去歧视你”。最后，陈提出分手，张痛苦伤心后，终于从失恋里走了出来，去找陈，告诉他我已经独立，已经可以离开你坚强生活。而陈又反悔，想重新追求。林夕的歌词又一次命中：“嫌弃你想再会，被丢低想反悔”。\n\n《十二夜》是一部残酷的爱情故事，甚至被人称为爱情纪录片。我下意识得觉得它跟侯麦的爱情电影有所连接。后来我发现，与法国新浪潮的关联，不光来自编剧、故事、镜头和视觉元素，也来自音乐的暗示。\n\n在Facebook“陈辉阳X女生合唱作品音乐会”的官方账号里，我发现了陈辉阳关于此曲的法国遐思，他说：\n\n> 香港文化其实是有多元文化产生的,就像餐厅的蛋挞,是由英国的蛋奶挞演变过来的,我们不喜欢原装的油松饼(硬皮), 我们用点创意 ,将它改成酥皮，牛油皮 (软皮或脆皮)。创作《黑夜不再来》的时候, 我常常想广东歌里能否加上法式流行曲的优雅气质 , 像 Michel Legrand , Francis Lai, serge gainsbourg 等 ,但在高潮的部份又可以有像肖邦旋律功能的华丽经过句，那时候,陈奕迅刚好在演一套电影叫做《十二夜》,就是这样,当创意遇上了适当的契机,好的作品就是这样产生的。录制我第一张钢琴唱片《声音变魔术》 的时候，认识了钢琴家 Genevieve Wong ,如果黑夜不再来是一顿法国式的港式甜品 , Genevieve Wong is a such amazing cook。请大家留意中段像肖邦的华丽经过句, 像一阵风般优雅脱俗 ,但又不失令人叹为观止。\n\n所以，下面放上 Genevieve Wong演奏的《黑夜不再来》。林夕的填词和陈奕迅的演唱，已经是人力的极致了。但和陈辉阳心仪的钢琴版本相比，你自能听出高下。", "timestamp": 1633765049, "digest": "-6chuBqYcL2L3twsmHptaQxGF3dLmUFP56b4vUDyaK0", "contributor": "0xE8B0314541Ea52802FbdC34aDdcF6Fac3854EEE1"}

(Note: This article will not discuss the principle of RSA threshold signature implementation, interested readers can learn *[Practical Threshold Signature](https://www.iacr.org/archive/eurocrypt2000/1807/18070209-new.pdf)s* by themselves).\n\nproposal hub ​​​​shoulders the responsibility of RSA threshold signature key generation and distribution.\n\nIn order to prevent the leakage of the generated threshold signature key from the source, the ecc pubkey of the watchman is injected in the process of generating the RSA threshold signature key to carry out ecies asymmetric encryption, and only the watchman can decrypt the RSA threshold key shared distributed to himself using the respective ecc private。\n\nEven if the proposal hub has a data leak, hackers cannot get the key shared, and to decrypt the key shared they must have the watchman’s ecc private key. Only by getting more than two-thirds of the watchman’s ecc private can control the AR lock position address on arweave, which greatly enhances the attack cost of hackers.\n\nThe ecc curve used by proposal hub is fully compatible with ethereum, so watchers only need to keep a valid ethereum secret key pair to complete multiple signatures for ethereum and arweave.\n\nThe RSA threshold signature key pair is generated only once, and a new threshold signature key pair is re-generated only when a watchman is added or removed.\n\nThe key generation and gaining process in the system is as follows:\n\n1.

{"id": "Wk4dk6Liu8N0vELBT1SxUnWcW-UC28W1rLPAadbGDj8", "title": "陈辉阳：流行歌的古典魔法师", "body": "终于有机会聊聊陈辉阳了。6月25日，香港红馆将举办陈辉阳X女声合唱作品展《人来人往》，因为疫情一拖再拖的演出，终于有望举行，对歌迷和创作者来讲，都是一桩乐事。\n\n对了解陈辉阳过往创作的歌迷来讲，他的作品几乎每一首都是经典。有心人想必也会留意到，我的昵称其实也来自他的工作室名。\n\n从2016年起，陈辉阳与28人组成的“女声合唱团”，已经有过两次作品展。演出既没有大牌歌手，也没有炫目的舞台效果，只是黑白钢琴和极简的女声合唱。在这两次名为《少女的祈祷》和《上一次流泪》的演出中，包括如下曲目：黑夜不再来、Shall We Talk、日与夜、明日有明天、终身美丽、少女的祈祷、垃圾、暗涌、三千年前……哪一首拿出来，都是上世纪末本世纪初的广东歌经典，值得大书特书。\n\n华语流行音乐，被人们分为民谣、摇滚、电子、独立等风格。如若用上二胡、古筝和五声音阶，人们会贴上“中国风”或者民族风格。如果节奏强劲，则被分为舞曲。细究起来，欧美和日本在20世纪晚期的一些风格，比如Disco、R&B、Citypop、Trip-Hop、Rap甚至Jazz，我们也能在香港流行音乐找到对应的歌手、专辑和创作人。\n\n如果要用古典一词来给流行歌贴标签，恐怕只有陈辉阳一人有资格来独占这个分类了。\n\n在虾米（已关闭）、网易云音乐等App里，我们可以搜到和陈辉阳有关的歌单，有心人把他的许多作品和对应的古典音乐一一配对。\n\n歌名有直接对应关系的包括杨千嬅的《少女的祈祷》和陈奕迅的《给爱丽丝》（贝多芬名曲《Für Elise》）。\n\n《少女的祈祷》的创作过程早已成为一段佳话。1999年的圣诞节晚上，陈辉阳跟林夕晚饭后，在车上想到一个故事：“故事发生在巴士上，天阴，女孩在心里祷告，如果能顺利通过三盏交通灯都是绿灯的话，就永远和那个陌生男孩在一起。但巴士过了第二盏灯，男孩就下车了。”林夕就此写下了虔诚而伤心的歌词：……然而天父并未体恤好人/到我睁开眼 无明灯指引/我爱主 为何任我身边爱人/离弃了我 下了车 你怎可答允。\n\n而旋律的灵感则来自陈辉阳小时候弹奏过的古典乐曲、由波兰女作曲家巴达捷夫斯卡（Baranowska）创作的《少女的祈祷》钢琴曲《Modlitwa Dziewicy Op. 4》。\n\n另外一个不为人知的例子来自陈奕迅的《2001太空漫游》，这首华丽炫耀的电子音乐，陈辉阳的灵感素材来自施特劳斯（Richard Georg Strauss）的《查拉图斯特拉如时说》（Also sprach Zarathustra）。\n\n将古典音乐化为流行歌，这个事情看似美妙，实则很难。以钢琴曲为例，人声的音高区间、速度以及节奏，不论怎样高超，都很难跟上手指触摸键盘的那种曼妙跳跃。反过来说，陈辉阳创作的很多歌曲，如果改用钢琴和弦乐，或许更适合聆听。所以，在那些经典的人声K歌之外，我们还能找到许多用钢琴来演绎的版本。《声音变魔术》《与音乐谈情》《听入非非》三部曲就是以钢琴为主的陈辉阳作品集。\n\n在这方面，与同期的其他作曲人，比如雷颂德、Eric Kwok、伍乐城等相比，陈辉阳的作品显然更适合古典的音色，比如钢琴，比如女声合唱。\n\n因此，在远离流行音乐多年之后，近几年陈辉阳以另一种古典的方式重新出现在大众眼前。\n\n以女声合唱的方式呈现自己的作品，陈辉阳是受到了父亲陈振华的启发，也是一种致敬。陈振华是澳门儿童合唱团的指挥，2016年退休之际，他在澳门做了一场小型的告别仪式。在现场观看的陈辉阳突然来了灵感，他想要用唱诗班合唱的方式，让几十名女子的组合，来优美地演绎自己那一连串的K歌经典之作。不请明星，不用原唱者，陈辉阳转而向社会招募，凑成了28名女子合唱团。他们利用下班时间排练，一起磨合、研讨，筹备做一场简约朴素的“致敬青春回忆”的主题音乐会。\n\n以《暗涌》为例，这首陈辉阳的成名曲，以行云流水的钢琴演奏，情感起伏的女声合唱，着重音乐旋律本身，打动了很多人的心。听过女声合唱的观众说，“好治愈…好想流眼泪…我真的能感觉到台上女生悲伤的歌声是‘涌’向台下的！”\n\n二十八位年轻女生、两位钢琴演奏者和一个乐团指挥，构成了陈辉阳再次“圈粉”的班底。虽然近年来他的作品明显减少，但这一次的呈现方式变得更加精致。用唱诗班式的天籁之声重新演绎，给人耳目一新之感。在征服观众的同时，也征服了亚洲金曲奖各大评委。\n\n陈辉阳作品的古典气质，来自儿时和家庭的浸润。他在一次访问中说：“小时候的我只听古典音乐。有一次翻开爸爸的抽屉，看到一些录音卡带，当中有些以『串烧歌』形式出版的古典音乐。后来我发现那些音乐本来是很长的乐章，于是就把原装的逐一买回来。从小学四年级时便开始收集黑胶唱片、CD专辑，目前总数超过一万多张”。当时他对流行音乐不大感兴趣，反而对贝多芬、马勒、拉赫曼尼诺夫、利盖蒂（György Ligeti）、 武满彻、阿福·佩尔特等作曲家的作品特别喜爱。\n\n陈辉阳小时就读于澳门培正中学，之后在广州星海音乐学院学习钢琴，大学毕业于美国波士顿的伯克利音乐学院（Berklee College of Music）修读唱片录制、监制和录音工程。陈辉阳于1994年自美国返港后，便开始在录音公司担任录音工作。《明报香港乐坛四十年经典唱片》里评论：“陈辉阳可能是香港乐坛自顾嘉辉后一个能创出一种新曲风的作曲人而作品又能自成一个体系者。陈的西洋古典风流行曲跟顾的中式小调流行曲颇不相同。”\n\n我最早留意到陈辉阳的特殊气味，来自陈奕迅 的《黑夜不再来》。在茫茫流行歌中，这首歌是如此不同。在听过陈奕迅多个演唱会版本、钢琴演奏版本、女声合唱版本之后，我总有新的发现。真是一种历久弥新的体验。6/8拍子流淌出的旋律，是一种优雅的悲伤，仿佛双脚浸没在黑夜的海滩，任海风吹拂，任海水侵袭。\n\n《黑夜不再来》竟然已是20年前的作品，它本是林爱华导演的电影《十二夜》的片尾曲。这部电影有点法国新浪潮风格，说的是让人绝望的小情小爱。电影由发生在12个夜晚的故事组成。陈奕迅和张柏芝因为各自失恋而在一起，开始热络，后来变成斯德哥尔摩综合症，张柏芝对他越好，他就越不珍惜。林夕的歌词写道，“讨好我等于鼓励我去歧视你”。最后，陈提出分手，张痛苦伤心后，终于从失恋里走了出来，去找陈，告诉他我已经独立，已经可以离开你坚强生活。而陈又反悔，想重新追求。林夕的歌词又一次命中：“嫌弃你想再会，被丢低想反悔”。\n\n《十二夜》是一部残酷的爱情故事，甚至被人称为爱情纪录片。我下意识得觉得它跟侯麦的爱情电影有所连接。后来我发现，与法国新浪潮的关联，不光来自编剧、故事、镜头和视觉元素，也来自音乐的暗示。\n\n在Facebook“陈辉阳X女生合唱作品音乐会”的官方账号里，我发现了陈辉阳关于此曲的法国遐思，他说：\n\n> 香港文化其实是有多元文化产生的,就像餐厅的蛋挞,是由英国的蛋奶挞演变过来的,我们不喜欢原装的油松饼(硬皮), 我们用点创意 ,将它改成酥皮，牛油皮 (软皮或脆皮)。创作《黑夜不再来》的时候, 我常常想广东歌里能否加上法式流行曲的优雅气质 , 像 Michel Legrand , Francis Lai, serge gainsbourg 等 ,但在高潮的部份又可以有像肖邦旋律功能的华丽经过句，那时候,陈奕迅刚好在演一套电影叫做《十二夜》,就是这样,当创意遇上了适当的契机,好的作品就是这样产生的。录制我第一张钢琴唱片《声音变魔术》 的时候，认识了钢琴家 Genevieve Wong ,如果黑夜不再来是一顿法国式的港式甜品 , Genevieve Wong is a such amazing cook。请大家留意中段像肖邦的华丽经过句, 像一阵风般优雅脱俗 ,但又不失令人叹为观止。\n\n所以，下面放上 Genevieve Wong演奏的《黑夜不再来》。林夕的填词和陈奕迅的演唱，已经是人力的极致了。但和陈辉阳心仪的钢琴版本相比，你自能听出高下。", "timestamp": 1633765475, "digest": "-6chuBqYcL2L3twsmHptaQxGF3dLmUFP56b4vUDyaK0", "contributor": "0xE8B0314541Ea52802FbdC34aDdcF6Fac3854EEE1"}

I see **at least** **20x** potential of trading volume, as derivatives should act as the same of **Dex / Cex Ratio** of spots.\n* Perpetuals are the most popular decentralized derivatives just as in centralized space, with US$47B accumulative trading volume today, 92 times**¹** the figure of Options volume, the latter of which is more for high-skilled gamblers to hedge the risk.\n* I simplify 2 types of liquidity models for derivatives: “**Peer to Pool**” (Perpetual Protocol, Synthetix, etc.) or “**Peer to Peer**” (dYdX, etc.). The first one allows freely derivatives listing, lower liquidity requirements; The latter one has less platform risk, higher leverage tolerance, and various order types (Fortunately, Uniswap V3 actually makes limit order and more order types possible.)\n* I love vAMM design! vAMM is only for price generation, while it separated the liquidity pool out to mitigate the impermanent loss for stakers. Unlike AMM design (say, Uniswap), one-token staking makes positions hedged and cut a lot of profit loss for stakers. While Uniswap stakers bear all the profit loss for their positions because they are traders as well for the pair staking.\n* I see perpetual projects using \\*\\*“Peer to Pool” \\*\\*design such as Perpetual Protocol are the **improved versions** of Synthetix in the way of better UIUX and higher capital efficiency, etc.\n* I projected FDV for dYdX would be \\~US$11,451 Million by initiating \\*FDV / APR \\*ratio. Given dYdX’s total supply of 1,000,000,000, **per dYdX token price should be \\~$11.45**. Interestingly, the estimated figure is not too far from reality: the estimated FDV of Perpetual Protocol is US$2,801 Million, while the market figure is \\~US$3,010 Million, as of Sept 1, 2021.\n\n## Macro factors are pushing: (Pass this part if you already know that DEXs are the future!)\n\n1. Stricter regulation on centralized derivatives. Binance recently shuts down derivatives trading offerings in Hong Kong, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. BitMEX, which was once the largest derivatives exchange, recently was required to pay $100 million penalty to settle the charges with CFTC and FinCEN. Traders in more regions are beginning to turn to decentralized derivatives.\n2. Centralized exchanges are too powerful and less innovative. Due to the custody of user assets and the sole possession of transaction data, we see a lot of “emergencies” such as suspend withdrawals, freezes, downtime, etc. Even worse, centralized exchanges may treat trading data abusively. Robinhood has previously accused that its main business model is to sell customer orders to high-frequency traders, so it benefits from leaking customer information. Centralized platforms have been difficult to gain users’ trust.\n3. Layer 2 is making things work. In August, dYdX’s trading volume is **55 times²** the figure in March with the fact that Layer 2 perpetuals went live in April. Perpetual Protocol will soon launch its V2, Curie on Arbitrum, so as Futureswap’s V3. Decentralized exchanges are poised to replace centralized exchanges.\n\n## Two inside signals are showing:\n\nAmong all the derivative products in this space, perpetual contracts are currently the most popular ones with the largest trading volume. They are developed on the basis of delivery futures with no expiry date. Therefore, it is characterized by a funding rate mechanism, which is to prevent the price from deviating from the spot price and avoid becoming a pure gambling tool.\n\n> Dex / Cex Ratio\n\nIn 2021Q1, the transaction volume of centralized perpetual contracts exceeds US$14 trillion**³**. While in the same period, decentralized perpetual contracts generated US$7 billion\\*\\*⁴ \\*\\*volume, which counts for 0.05% of centralized transaction volume. At the moment, decentralized perpetuals account for 0.5%\\*\\*⁵ \\*\\*of the monthly transaction volume of centralized ones, 10x the figure in Q1.\n\nIn the spot market, this figure is 10%**⁶**. That means decentralized derivatives trading volume would still go up at least 20x, even given no growth on centralized derivatives.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*HPBRkMmkdrcgzJAjNMMlVQ.png)\n\nData Source: CoinGecko, as of August 31, 2021. Note: Cex data includes Binance Futures, Huobi Futures, OKEx Futures, FTX derivatives, Bybit Futures.\n\n> Token Launch Effect\n\nI believe that the issuance of platform tokens by the leading projects will have a very large pulling effect on the entire sector. The following figure shows the impact on the centralized exchange before and after the issuance of the derivatives leader dYdX and the spot leader Uniswap. It can be seen that after the issuance of UNI, spot Dex / Cex Ratio jumped to 20% and it is never getting back to the level before August 2020 (rumors of token launch came out after the last round of fundraising).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*hUhLNRwBlnfbt23DyNbnoA.png)\n\nData Source: The Block. Note: I ignore the Sept figure for incomplete data.\n\n## Dive in, who are the best ones?\n\nI here only discuss: Perpetuals with linear P&L, Options with convex P&L, and Synthetics with irregular P&L.\n\nPerpetuals with US$47B accumulated volume proved themselves are most welcomed, 92 times the figure of Options. The latter one is suitable and attractive for professionals to hedge. However, there are several projects that are trying to bring it mainstream. [Shield Official](https://medium.com/u/c53460ddfcca?source=post_page-----cc5549629ea2--------------------------------) is testing simple perpetual/everlasting option products for general users.\n\nSynthetics are interesting. But sadly, they are all not as easy as perpetuals to understand and trade, while some of them provide diversified innovative yielding products. For example, one of the most popular products on UMA is Yield Dollar with \\~US$36M assets locked**⁷**, which is similar to a zero-coupon bond (fixed interest rate/yield).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*aBLq9Z7VK91oW4OnrYoxqw.png)\n\n> \\*\\*“Peer to Pool” \\*\\*or **“Peer to Peer”** ?\n\n* \\*\\*“Peer to Pool” \\*\\*means the traders’ counterparties are pools, or the stakers, normally. For example, if you are staking PERP on Perpetual Protocol V1, you are actually the counterparty of those traders. You are taking this risk because you are rewarded to do so (rewards come from trading fees and inflation). They even create a Virtual AMM to cut out price fluctuation for stakers to decrease impermanent loss. The purpose is to make stakers stake to expand liquidity. That’s important: imagine only one trader in this system, if he bet right, who should pay him? Now, we are clear why Perpetual Protocol can only allow you to have 10x maximum leverage, and why it sets an emergency shutdown function. Risk control is important for those derivatives platforms to prevent net negative positions.\n* **“Peer to Peer”** means the traders’ counterparties are other traders, or the market makers, normally. For example, dYdX has an order book, which is a sign for matchmaking. That is, different from Perpetual Protocol, ideally, dYdX has zero involvement in trading against anyone. Hence I do see dYdX has a high tolerance for 25x maximum leverage.\n\nI believe both are needed in the near future. \\*\\*“Peer to Pool” \\*\\*shows the capacity for long-tail assets that have low liquidity. It can even allow freely list token derivatives in the future, which may be adopted in Perpetual’s Curie version. Meanwhile, \\*\\*“Peer to Peer” \\*\\*provides a similar Cex experience, such as various types of orders, compared with Perpetual Protocol V1 only has market orders. But I do see solutions from Uniswap V3’s design, which makes limit order and more order types possible.\n\n> The evolution of derivatives\n\nI see \\*\\*“Peer to Pool” \\*\\*Perpetuals as an improved version of Synthetix. There are 3 reasons: a) why bother to use a more complex system when you can easily get crypto exposure from Perpetuals; b) currently, near 90%**⁹** of synths on Synthetix are cryptos synthetic tokens, which means the need for real-world assets is not mature. Additionally, perpetuals are capable for real-world assets derivatives as well; c) Margin is well adopted and it shows higher capital efficiency than collateralization, comparing 200% liquidation ratio of Synthetix with 2.5% liquidation ratio of Perpetual Protocol.\n\n## Going to the Moon?\n\nI analyzed the metrics of current spot dexes and initiated a useful multiple for further valuation projection: “*FDV / APR” (Fully Diluted Valuation / Annual Projected Revenue).*\n\nMultiplying *FDV / APR* median of spot dexes by derivatives APR accordingly, I estimate FDV for dYdX would be \\~US$11,451 Million, and FDV for Perpetual Protocol would be \\~US$2,801 Million.\n\nGiven dYdX total supply of 1,000,000,000, per token price should be \\~$11.45.\n\nInterestingly, the estimated figure is not too far from reality: FDV of Perpetual Protocol is \\~US$3,010 Million, as of Sept 1, 2021.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*5suHrw_GNsRSzQmLeha0ng.png)\n\nData Source: The Block, CoinGecko\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*EiEwg4RnXv35TYmaTAI7Ig.png)\n\nData Source: The Block, CoinGecko\n\n## Appendix: 2 types of derivatives comparables\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*l-I89dtqxn3GzBaluWHyvA.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*VRY2nq9BvM4x1W9jhERmFA.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*OL4m29Ezo6vUkAmbHpaobw.png)\n\n## References:\n\n*(all the data captured as of August 31, 2021)*\n\n(1) Accumulative Vol:\n\nPerpetuals US$46.8B \\[dYdX: US$17.5B from [dYdX metabase metrics](https://metabase.dydx.exchange/public/dashboard/5fa0ea31-27f7-4cd2-8bb0-bc24473ccaa3); Perpetual Protocol: US$25.1B from [Dune Analytics @yenwen / Perpetual Protocol](https://dune.xyz/yenwen/perpetual-protocol_2); Futureswap: US$4.2B from [futureswap.com](https://www.futureswap.com/).\\]\n\nSynthetics US$9.4B \\[Synthetix: US$9.4B from [stats.synthetix.io](http://stats.synthetix.io/); UMA: no transaction data, TVL is US$144M from [projects.umaproject](https://projects.umaproject.org/); Mirror Finance: \\~US$13.9M from the most traded assets on [mirror.finance](https://terra.mirror.finance/trade);\\]\n\nOptions US$507M \\[Hegic: US$492M from [hegic.co](http://hegic.co/); Opyn: US$15M from [Dune Analytics @loren / Opyn v2](https://dune.xyz/loren/Opyn).\\]\n\n(2) Our calculation is based on data from CoinGecko.\n\n(3) <https://image.tokeninsight.com/levelPdf/TI_Research_Report_-_2021_Q1_Crypto_Perpetual_Trading.pdf>\n\n(4) Our calculation includes the volume of dYdX, Perpetual Protocol, and Futureswap sourcing from CoinGecko and Dune Analytics.\n\n(5) Our calculation includes the volume of dYdX, Perpetual Protocol, and Binance Futures, Huobi Futures, OKEx Futures, FTX derivatives, Bybit Futures.

Regulatory actions in the US tend to be announced towards the year-end, and the SEC has made sure to keep the tradition alive, threatening to sue Coinbase if they proceeded with their “Lend” product, and the SEC also failed to offer any further clarity on currently offered interest accounts from the likes of BlockFi and Celsius. In addition, SEC Chair Gensler made a few worrying remarks, *“It’s a misnomer to say they are just software they put out in the web”* emphasising that DeFi platforms have a *“fair amount of centralisation”.* A case in point was when AMM platform Uniswap decided to delist a number of tokens that resembled securities when the SEC started looking at the space, or aggregator platform 1inch, that blocked out US traders and plans to launch a US-dedicated platform to remain compliant. Stablecoins are also being discussed, with FED Chair Powell comparing them to money market funds or bank accounts and calling for comparable regulation. Although some regulation is necessary for the market to mature, some unreasonable proposals are at risk of being approved by the House before the end of October, with Biden determined to pass the infrastructure bill well before that and, hidden in it, requirements for everyone that facilitates crypto transactions (without clearly excluding miners, or even developers) to collect personal details of the parties involved in the transactions, as well as reporting requirement to the IRS for anyone involved in a crypto transaction of more than $10,000 in value. An unattainable challenge in a decentralised pseudonymous p2p market.\n\nIf you think that the crypto industry in the US is under pressure, the Chinese government brought the game to a whole new level towards the end of the Summer season.. In the most serious crackdown to-date, the Central Bank (PBoC), along with nine other central government and judicial agencies, released a statement declaring all crypto transactions illegal. While the announcement came late in the season, it seems that insiders were warned long before, helping to explain the sell-off two weeks earlier. In response to the renewed emphasis on the anti-crypto stance of the government, exchanges like Huobi and Binance announced that they would prohibit users from mainland China to trade on their platforms, while market data platforms like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap are now fully blocked. Further to that, the notice seems to extend also to those who live in China but are employed by offshore crypto firms.\n\nWhile still too early to see how this will play out in the future, one interesting datapoint is displayed in Figure 2, where we observe the trading performance of the ETH/USDT pair in the separate trading sessions of New York, London, and Hong Kong. Throughout the last two years the entirety of the buying interest was shown during the Western session, when retail activity peaks. Asian hours have instead demonstrated a constant selling pressure, perhaps reflecting the lower retail participation, as well as the higher number of miners, who might offload inventory via OTC trades during their respective daytime.\n\nMeanwhile, mining activity has not been unaffected by the latest tightening by the Chinese government. After the exodus of Bitcoin miners earlier in the year, Ethereum mining pools Beepool (4th largest) and Sparkpool (2nd largest) announced that they will terminate operations in early October. The largest reseller of mining equipment and b2b e-commerce giant Alibaba has notified third-party merchants that sales of crypto mining equipment will be prohibited, further weakening the prospects for the industry in the country.\n\n![Figure 2: Ethereum price performance during market hours in the three main geographies: New York, London, and Hong Kong (also referred to as US, European and Asian hours). It can be noticed that there is a substantial bid while the Western hemisphere is awake, while during the Asian session selling pressure is almost constant. Source: Messari](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/alzfK8fiSK4oMxuOQ6iX5.png?height=998&width=1770&&&size=medium)\n\n![Figure 3: Bitcoin’s Daily hashrate estimate during 2021. Since the crackdown on miners starting in May this year, and the subsequent drop in hashrate, new capacity being deployed in the US, as well as some Chinese miners having already relocated abroad caused hashrate to double from the bottom reached in July.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/minUksWM7bbzDA-kYJFIA.png?height=350&width=536&&&size=medium)\n\nOn an alternative trend, mining capacity which has been lost in China is resurfacing online in North America and other regions. In Figure 3 we display the daily estimated hashrate of the Bitcoin network, and we can observe how it has increased by 100% after the Q2 crash and the low reached earlier in the Summer. Most of the capacity added to the network this Summer is generated by ASICs ordered last year and only recently delivered, so we can expect additional capacity to be brought online as Chinese miners redeploy their machines offshore.\n\nDespite the positive figures on the hashrate recovery, we notice that the current macro backdrop has been historically adverse for crypto prices, with particular emphasis on the tapering off of major Central Banks balance sheet growth. Previous examples of significantly lower magnitude can be found in 2014 and 2018. Global markets also had a negative month, with drama surrounding Evergrande debt and heavy losses across the Chinese tech sector, as well as stagflation fear in the US, where the debt ceiling farce is being repeated once more.\n\nIn response to the adverse environment during September the crypto market accumulated losses of approximately 10%, on average. There was a partial recovery on the 1st of October, as a celebration for the start of the new quarter, and of the words of Chairman Powell who, while calling for tighter regulation for stablecoins, stated that there is no intention to outright ban cryptocurrencies in the US.\n\n![Figure 4: Lightning Network total capacity since inception. After having experienced strong growth over the last two quarters, the network currently has a capacity of $150m and more than 70 thousand channels. Source: Glassnode](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/edDO_Zq-zoGAn05fXPAvT.png?height=937&width=1600&&&size=medium)\n\nWhile the homepage of news websites alternate between positive and negative events, crypto adoption proceeds, unstoppable, on its path to mainstream usage. The Bitcoin Lightning network, the only viable solution for Bitcoin micropayments, has seen a parabolic growth in network capacity, as displayed in Figure 4, and in the number of channels online which recently surpassed the 70k mark. Widespread adoption of the Ethereum network does not surprise anymore, with more than $1 billion in Ether being burned since EIP-1559 went online in early August, and as a result of the intense usage of the network. Another signal of the success of Ethereum comes from the implementation of an NFT verification system (on Ethereum) for profile pictures on Twitter, a platform whose funder is fully dedicated to the growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Twitter, earlier in September, also released a tipping functionality that leverages the Lightening network. Another social media platform that bought into the NFT mania is TikTok, which plans to release a collection of their most popular videos as NFTs, with the intention to empower the creators on their platform. As shown in Figure 5,  NFTs show remarkable resilience, despite the cooldown of the wider market, and the palpable frothiness of the NFT market, sales keep increasing, and are approaching their previous all-time high of 85,000 daily transactions. Some of the valuations have come down considerably, in particular in some of the lower quality projects, but adoption is increasing as also demonstrated by the weekly recurrence of Sotheby’s and Christie’s auctions.\n\n![Figure 5: NFT Sales and Trading Volume over the last quarter. Despite Volume having cooled down to below $100m daily, the number of sales is approaching the all-time high of 85,000 daily transactions, last achieved when daily sales approached $350m per day. Not the signs of a bubble.

The sophistication of the structured products in DeFi is increasing, while simpler products like Perpetual Swaps experienced their moment of fame when non-custodial (and non-KYCd) derivative platform DyDx recorded two days of volumes approaching $10b (more than Coinbase on those days) due to their trading incentives and the parabolic price increase of their governance token. In the lending markets, MakerDAO has received an application from SocGen for a $20m loan in DAI collateralised by tokenised bonds rated AAA by Moody’s and Fitch. As one of the most significant interactions between traditional finance and DeFi to date, this pilot project is expected to provide the legal architecture to reproduce similar deals at scale, allowing to address the huge Repo market.\n\nAnother huge market that might soon be within crypto’s reach is the US ETF market, with multiple deadlines for the SEC ruling approaching for both physical and future (CME) backed products. The latter, in particular, seems likely to be approved, with SEC Chair Gensler declaring that the agency was looking forward to reviewing new applications for these kinds of products.\n\n![Figure 6: Total Value Locked in alternative L1 chains. In the picture Avalanche in yellow, Terra in green, and Solana in purple. The latter has experienced an explosive growth over the last two months accumulating $8B in assets for a total of just below $10B. Source: Delphi Digital](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NeR_c_kg4zlRqpb23VRZm.png?height=610&width=1148&&&size=medium)\n\nLooking at the price performance of various tokens more closely, a few names showed considerable strength and, including August, distanced themselves from the rest of the market, with price increases between 150% and 400%, as shown in Figure 1. The common characteristic among these tokens is that they represent the native currency of an L-1 protocol, those who used to be called ETH-killers. We show in Figure 6 the YTD growth in TVL within the DeFi ecosystems that developed on top of these alternative (to Ethereum) Blockchains. But how does this reconcile with the ever-growing popularity of Ethereum itself? Are these protocols trying to replace Ethereum in a winner-take-all game?\n\nThe market currently thinks that this is not a likely future, and it is instead considering the idea of a multichain world, where the user interacts with different purpose-built blockchains via service-specific front-ends (OpenSea for example shows someone’s NFTs on both Ethereum and Polygon). As bridging capabilities develop, and natively interoperable Blockchains mature (Cosmos SDK IBC module released earlier this year), the difficulties of managing assets across multiple chains will be abstracted away from the user with cross-chain wallets ([XDEFI just raised $6m](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/118987/metamask-challenger-xdefi-wallet-funding)) enabling seamless portability across chains.\n\nL-1 competitors to Ethereum however represent a small part of the market, with an insignificant share of Spot volume and, as displayed by Figure 7, of the derivatives market. Counting by Open Interest (OI), almost 80% of the value is written on BTC and ETH.\n\n![Figure 7: Composition of the market in terms of current Open Interest (OI) on major derivatives exchanges. Bitcoin represents just over half of the market, while Ether just over a quarter. The remaining activity is concentrated in Solana, Ripple, Cardano and Binance Coin, none of which represents more than 2%-3% of the market each. Source: ByBt.com](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/t0Brtx1nMn6KtgtQEsdZq.png?height=858&width=1927)\n\n![Figure 8: Slow bleeding of the OI on major derivatives exchanges for both BTC and ETH, with the market having shrunk by approximately a third, on average. The maturity of quarterly products on September 24th has also contributed to weaker figures as most OI for Options has not been rolled. Source: Delphi Digital](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p9zXvlmbqQZWA4MzuUetp.PNG?height=831&width=950)\n\nAs discussed in the August commentary, *“Unless more capital is deployed in the weeks to come, the speculative activity would not suggest a bullish positioning”*, and indeed we saw a cooldown of the bid on derivative products. Overall, this caused the derivative markets to shrink by a third, with spot demand ultimately failing to compensate for the shift and causing prices to move lower. In Figure 8 we show the decisive reduction in OI on major derivative venues for Futures and Options on Bitcoin and Ether.\n\nAs expected from the loss of Open Interest, demand for leverage has been low during September, after having collapsed on September 7th when the market moved 15% lower while liquidating $3.2B of long positions. We show in Figure 9 the superimposition of premia for Perpetual Swap contracts on Bitcoin and Ether traded on major derivatives exchanges.\n\n![Figure 9: 24 hours moving average of the difference in pricing between Perpetual Swaps on major derivative venues and spot indices for BTC and ETH. After the initial excitement at the beginning of the month, demand for leverage dropped considerably on the 7th, as the market moved lower, and never recovered with neither a bullish nor bearish bias. Source: Fasanara Digital](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G0IKSXdX1LgBhg1ei5WDs.png?height=955&width=1835&&&size=medium)\n\nWith the recent recovery in sentiment and the market moving higher at the start of October, rates are recovering across the board, with the Futures curve steepening and showing a consistent upward trend on all maturities.\n\nOptions markets have also shown signs of a reversal, after weeks of negative skew on short term maturities (with puts more expensive than comparable calls), recent readings are in more neutral territory, with a better outlook for BTC than ETH currently. Implied Volatility (IV) structure remains in contango, as we are unlikely to see a spike in short term volatility without a significant contribution from the Perpetual and Futures markets.\n\nProvided that we still believe that more capital needs to be deployed on spot markets for prices to move materially higher, we observe in Figure 10 that, with hindsight, the regime of net outflows from exchanges started in March 2020 was not interrupted by the sudden increase in inflows earlier this year. Exchange outflows are still a predominant characteristic of this market, ever reducing the available supply of Bitcoins for sale and setting the stage for higher prices once demand picks up.\n\n![Figure 10: The chart shows the net exchange flows for Bitcoin since early 2015 superimposed with Bitcoin logarithmic price series. As indicated in the chart, since March 2020, and except during the severe sell-off in the first half of the year, outflows strongly dominate inflows, with less and less bitcoin available for sale on exchanges. Source: Glassnode](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hyVCJfhMdC4rotgquMlr4.png?height=937&width=1600&&&size=medium)\n\nOther on-chain indicators however seem to paint a less optimistic picture, showing an overall cooldown in activity that historically has coincided with periods of bear market. In Figure 11 we show the moving average of the number of active entities on the Bitcoin network, highlighting a baseline increasing trend of adoption, as well as times of explosive, speculative activity that have historically coincided with substantial price increases.\n\nCurrently, and throughout the summer, activity has slowed down considerably, reaching a level well within the expected baseline trend. There is however no indication of when the activity will pick up again. However, as discussed at length, there are numerous reasons to believe that it might not take long after all.\n\n![Figure 11: The chart shows the number of active entities on the Bitcoin blockchain. Despite the increasing adoption trend, that saw the number of active entities doubling over the past 5 years, phases of speculation and positive price action, have been characterised in the past by spikes in the number of active entities, which has recently crashed well within the historical baseline trend.

After having experienced strong growth over the last two quarters, the network currently has a capacity of $150m and more than 70 thousand channels.

The Bitcoin Lightning network, the only viable solution for Bitcoin micropayments, has seen a parabolic growth in network capacity, as displayed in Figure 4, and in the number of channels online which recently surpassed the 70k mark. Widespread adoption of the Ethereum network does not surprise anymore, with more than $1 billion in Ether being burned since EIP-1559 went online in early August, and as a result of the intense usage of the network. Another signal of the success of Ethereum comes from the implementation of an NFT verification system (on Ethereum) for profile pictures on Twitter, a platform whose funder is fully dedicated to the growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Twitter, earlier in September, also released a tipping functionality that leverages the Lightening network. Another social media platform that bought into the NFT mania is TikTok, which plans to release a collection of their most popular videos as NFTs, with the intention to empower the creators on their platform. As shown in Figure 5,  NFTs show remarkable resilience, despite the cooldown of the wider market, and the palpable frothiness of the NFT market, sales keep increasing, and are approaching their previous all-time high of 85,000 daily transactions. Some of the valuations have come down considerably, in particular in some of the lower quality projects, but adoption is increasing as also demonstrated by the weekly recurrence of Sotheby’s and Christie’s auctions.\n\n![Figure 5: NFT Sales and Trading Volume over the last quarter. Despite Volume having cooled down to below $100m daily, the number of sales is approaching the all-time high of 85,000 daily transactions, last achieved when daily sales approached $350m per day. Not the signs of a bubble.

The sophistication of the structured products in DeFi is increasing, while simpler products like Perpetual Swaps experienced their moment of fame when non-custodial (and non-KYCd) derivative platform DyDx recorded two days of volumes approaching $10b (more than Coinbase on those days) due to their trading incentives and the parabolic price increase of their governance token. In the lending markets, MakerDAO has received an application from SocGen for a $20m loan in DAI collateralised by tokenised bonds rated AAA by Moody’s and Fitch. As one of the most significant interactions between traditional finance and DeFi to date, this pilot project is expected to provide the legal architecture to reproduce similar deals at scale, allowing to address the huge Repo market.\n\nAnother huge market that might soon be within crypto’s reach is the US ETF market, with multiple deadlines for the SEC ruling approaching for both physical and future (CME) backed products. The latter, in particular, seems likely to be approved, with SEC Chair Gensler declaring that the agency was looking forward to reviewing new applications for these kinds of products.\n\n![Figure 6: Total Value Locked in alternative L1 chains. In the picture Avalanche in yellow, Terra in green, and Solana in purple. The latter has experienced an explosive growth over the last two months accumulating $8B in assets for a total of just below $10B.

The common characteristic among these tokens is that they represent the native currency of an L-1 protocol, those who used to be called ETH-killers. We show in Figure 6 the YTD growth in TVL within the DeFi ecosystems that developed on top of these alternative (to Ethereum) Blockchains. But how does this reconcile with the ever-growing popularity of Ethereum itself? Are these protocols trying to replace Ethereum in a winner-take-all game?\n\nThe market currently thinks that this is not a likely future, and it is instead considering the idea of a multichain world, where the user interacts with different purpose-built blockchains via service-specific front-ends (OpenSea for example shows someone’s NFTs on both Ethereum and Polygon). As bridging capabilities develop, and natively interoperable Blockchains mature (Cosmos SDK IBC module released earlier this year), the difficulties of managing assets across multiple chains will be abstracted away from the user with cross-chain wallets ([XDEFI just raised $6m](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/118987/metamask-challenger-xdefi-wallet-funding)) enabling seamless portability across chains.\n\nL-1 competitors to Ethereum however represent a small part of the market, with an insignificant share of Spot volume and, as displayed by Figure 7, of the derivatives market. Counting by Open Interest (OI), almost 80% of the value is written on BTC and ETH.\n\n![Figure 7: Composition of the market in terms of current Open Interest (OI) on major derivatives exchanges. Bitcoin represents just over half of the market, while Ether just over a quarter. The remaining activity is concentrated in Solana, Ripple, Cardano and Binance Coin, none of which represents more than 2%-3% of the market each. Source: ByBt.com](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/t0Brtx1nMn6KtgtQEsdZq.png?height=858&width=1927)\n\n![Figure 8: Slow bleeding of the OI on major derivatives exchanges for both BTC and ETH, with the market having shrunk by approximately a third, on average. The maturity of quarterly products on September 24th has also contributed to weaker figures as most OI for Options has not been rolled. Source: Delphi Digital](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p9zXvlmbqQZWA4MzuUetp.PNG?height=831&width=950)\n\nAs discussed in the August commentary, *“Unless more capital is deployed in the weeks to come, the speculative activity would not suggest a bullish positioning”*, and indeed we saw a cooldown of the bid on derivative products. Overall, this caused the derivative markets to shrink by a third, with spot demand ultimately failing to compensate for the shift and causing prices to move lower. In Figure 8 we show the decisive reduction in OI on major derivative venues for Futures and Options on Bitcoin and Ether.\n\nAs expected from the loss of Open Interest, demand for leverage has been low during September, after having collapsed on September 7th when the market moved 15% lower while liquidating $3.2B of long positions. We show in Figure 9 the superimposition of premia for Perpetual Swap contracts on Bitcoin and Ether traded on major derivatives exchanges.\n\n![Figure 9: 24 hours moving average of the difference in pricing between Perpetual Swaps on major derivative venues and spot indices for BTC and ETH. After the initial excitement at the beginning of the month, demand for leverage dropped considerably on the 7th, as the market moved lower, and never recovered with neither a bullish nor bearish bias. Source: Fasanara Digital](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G0IKSXdX1LgBhg1ei5WDs.png?height=955&width=1835&&&size=medium)\n\nWith the recent recovery in sentiment and the market moving higher at the start of October, rates are recovering across the board, with the Futures curve steepening and showing a consistent upward trend on all maturities.\n\nOptions markets have also shown signs of a reversal, after weeks of negative skew on short term maturities (with puts more expensive than comparable calls), recent readings are in more neutral territory, with a better outlook for BTC than ETH currently. Implied Volatility (IV) structure remains in contango, as we are unlikely to see a spike in short term volatility without a significant contribution from the Perpetual and Futures markets.\n\nProvided that we still believe that more capital needs to be deployed on spot markets for prices to move materially higher, we observe in Figure 10 that, with hindsight, the regime of net outflows from exchanges started in March 2020 was not interrupted by the sudden increase in inflows earlier this year. Exchange outflows are still a predominant characteristic of this market, ever reducing the available supply of Bitcoins for sale and setting the stage for higher prices once demand picks up.\n\n![Figure 10: The chart shows the net exchange flows for Bitcoin since early 2015 superimposed with Bitcoin logarithmic price series. As indicated in the chart, since March 2020, and except during the severe sell-off in the first half of the year, outflows strongly dominate inflows, with less and less bitcoin available for sale on exchanges. Source: Glassnode](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hyVCJfhMdC4rotgquMlr4.png?height=937&width=1600&&&size=medium)\n\nOther on-chain indicators however seem to paint a less optimistic picture, showing an overall cooldown in activity that historically has coincided with periods of bear market. In Figure 11 we show the moving average of the number of active entities on the Bitcoin network, highlighting a baseline increasing trend of adoption, as well as times of explosive, speculative activity that have historically coincided with substantial price increases.\n\nCurrently, and throughout the summer, activity has slowed down considerably, reaching a level well within the expected baseline trend. There is however no indication of when the activity will pick up again. However, as discussed at length, there are numerous reasons to believe that it might not take long after all.\n\n![Figure 11: The chart shows the number of active entities on the Bitcoin blockchain. Despite the increasing adoption trend, that saw the number of active entities doubling over the past 5 years, phases of speculation and positive price action, have been characterised in the past by spikes in the number of active entities, which has recently crashed well within the historical baseline trend.

{"id": "C_9-1gxtZq3aoWPtmSJXx2uFOmHCOtmEiTSkNWZU8n0", "title": "Four designers in a room 💡", "body": "## Here’s what they did\n\nOn a fine Wednesday evening, four designers found themselves in a room. They had nothing to say or do. One of the managed to break the silence. One thing led to another and then this happened!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*AiUfoz1DVhG30udu352kOg.png)\n\n### What did the designer say?\n\nOne of the designers shared an observation about our nearest and dearest chai vendor. Each morning, he would painstakingly broom away cigarette butts off the pavement. All because people wouldn’t use a bin to dispose of their cigarettes.\n\nLooked like the designers had found themselves a problem to solve—one that wasn’t commissioned by a client. *Oh, sweet creative freedom!*\n\n## The Stakeout! 👀 👀\n\nThe designers planted themselves into the scene. They observed how customers interacted with the space. Here’s what they saw:\n\n* Customers usually bought *chai & sutta* (cigarette) together\n* They would finish the chai and throw the cups into the bin\n* They would throw the cigarettes butts on the ground and put them out with their feet\n* ***They would leave the butts behind on the ground***\n\nOnce a butt was on the ground, nobody made an effort to pick it back up. But the very same customers dumped the chai cups into the bin. So this wasn’t due to ignorance. There had to be some other reason!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*zjBa-6fy-2lk_OeDwPaOXA.png)\n\n> The designers *hypothesised* that customers were merely avoiding a fire hazard\n\nThrowing lit cigarettes into a bin full of paper cups isn’t a bright idea, after all. The designers decided to take it up as a design challenge to help avoid throwing cigarettes onto the ground in the first place.\n\n## The Problem Statement\n\n> How might we provide customers a better way to put out cigarettes?\n\nIn an indoor setting, one might use an ashtray. Could the designers make a public ashtray? One that customers can use to put out cigarettes and then safely dispose of the butts into bins? ***They had an idea! 💡*️**\n\nThey ran around the office looking for raw materials and tools to create a prototype. The best they could manage was a wooden plank.\n\n![Notice how pink Einstein’s tongue is](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*h4QCZ1kZtp5ol1wF0W1VPA.png)\n\nThe designers hoped a giant ashtray with Einstein’s face on it would grab customers’ attention and appeal to their scientific sensibilities.\n\n## Installing the prototype\n\n\\*Einstein \\*was ready. They found some light rope to tie the plank to a nearby lamp post. It turned out to be a tricky task. They struggled to mount *Einstein* — it kept sliding off. The customers looked in wonder and confusion as the designers hung their heads low.\n\n### Deus ex machina! 👼\n\nTwo carpenters working in the basement of an adjacent building noticed the struggle. They volunteered to help. They took *Einstein* into their workspace and drilled holes. This helped balance the plank as they tied it to a lamp post.\n\n![Humans ❤](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*LyFI6kNL0DuXWnGC8bKiLg.png)\n\n## The Results\n\nThe designers installed the prototype and simply waited. They hoped people would\n\n1. Notice the plank\n2. Understand what its purpose is\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*a0DWEFwpoKN8BnwmyIOISQ.png)\n\n*Einstein’s* tongue got darker with each passing day. The rest of his face was quite intact. There was no vandalism of any kind, nor did anybody steal the plank — this was a huge win!\n\n## It didn’t end there\n\nPositive results inspired the designers to come back and improve the design. They started working on 2 new prototypes. They also identified another chai vendor in the vicinity to recreate the experiment.\n\n![“What client call?”](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*A40F9AAp-AzgP0qdYG6eHg.png)\n\n### Prototype 1: Improvements\n\nThey first sought to improve the original design. The new prototype was\n\n* more compact in form,\n* sturdier as it was made of metal, and\n* more noticeable and more readable due to the contrast between the bright orange and pitch black colours\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*yBPXmZqCrIi7zxs5P1PRbA.png)\n\nThe plank now supports the improved prototype!\n\nThe result with this prototype were consistent with that of Einstein’s. The metal mesh got darker and darker with each passing day — a sign of its increasing usage.\n\n### Prototype 2: New form factor\n\nThe biggest drawback with the Einstein was that it had to be hung. They explored a new form factor that stood on its own. Say hello to *Smoky!*\n\n![Smoky was modelled after a cigarette 🚬](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*9KxTaeq3qYU-nTWSjCvHMA.png)\n\n**Both prototypes were successful** and remained in their original locations for months. The designers have since then parted ways and have not been able to check in on *Einstein & Smoky*. But they like to think all is well!\n\n\n---\n\nThank you for reading this far. There is no larger message to this story other than what you will make of it. Take a moment. ❤\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*Cu0VJtlt9VlBe50GDb30Lg.png?size=large)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633766478, "digest": "7l_yz4JJjoWagu24YrPdW3xEGvAkdWagsTUsd3P6neI", "contributor": "0x4D168c89aA01843D3Fa92AFaE9C984F1A0C8918C"}

Joel Monegro, the author of fat protocal in 2019, believes that it no longer holds true. My point is that as the protocol layer rises, the above applications will capture more value. But what did the fat agreement originally say? It believes that most of the value of most protocols will be captured at the protocol layer, not the application layer.**\n\n* I support the view of the fat agreement. If it is wrong, then the so-called \"thin agreement\" in the opposite direction is right, and it will give direction to the industry.\n\n> **In terms of open finance and infrastructure, what are the potential new opportunities?**\n\n* Now, looking at the heads of Ethereum's lending, stablecoins, and smart financial management, and then drawing on the gourd and investing in similar things, innovation has slowed down a bit.\n* DeFi's biggest problem: how to do bigger user adoption? For example, MetaMask, first of all, how to prevent the computer from being poisoned and read out the private key or mnemonic? Second, how to operate the hardware wallet layer? How to save the mnemonic words? This is only the entry level. Furthermore, the operations inside are more complicated and the UE standard is different. Will anyone come to unify the UI interface in DeFi in the future? The future is mainly traffic. At present, it is mainly the indigenous people of the blockchain, from the A chain to the B chain, from the B chain to the C chain, they are all a group of people.\n\n> **There are also capital efficiency issues, such as the slippage of AMM. So what do you think are the opportunities in infrastructure?**\n\n* I am also very entangled. This wave of DeFi satisfies the rigid need to create wealth. Whether it is a founder or a participant, the motivation is very strong; but for infrastructure, it is difficult to make money in the early stage and before large-scale. It needs large financial support. Later, the entrance to a large number of users will be rewarded.\n* The ultimate experience is also one aspect, but also the traffic aspect. The demand is there, the scene is there, but there are too many choices, such as bridges. I think it might be the ending of winner takes all in the end?\n\n> **Super App is mainly in Asia, and the United States is still different. It may be related to user habits, but it does not happen in the United States. How do you think people feel differently in Silicon Valley? It's still the Internet, and there is actually no information gap anymore.**\n\n* There is almost no information gap, but there is a time gap.\n\n> **Looking back on the past 3-5 years, have you missed any projects that you regret?**\n\n* Maybe it's because my desires are not strong. I think I can go to this day. There are a lot of luck in it. I am very grateful.\n\n> **The success of OpenSea largely depends on it being early enough, surviving, and well written on the contract, establishing a scale effect.**\n\n* NFT is the longest time I spend to adjust my cognition, to understand it, to recognize it again, and to think about the logic behind it. I think there is no one more brain-burning than this in terms of time.\n\n> **Looking back at the beginning of the year, what was your outlook for the year at that time? Are there any things that you didn't expect at all?**\n\n* endless good news.\n* Extremely boring: the industry has matured.\n\n***Part II***\n\n时间：2021.09.27‌\n\n访谈人：Mable Jiang（Multicoin Capital），Xiahong Lin（Continue Capital）\n\n> **您的背景？**\n\n* Continue Capital创始合伙人之一。\n* 17年开始在币圈创业。\n* 之前engineer背景，腾讯，twitter，微软等。\n* 做过几十个不同种类的项目（web、mobile、blockchain）。\n\n> **最近觉得有意思、想做的东西？**\n\n* 最近想做的：\n  * 原来：自己执行，lead团队开始干。\n  * 现在：不一定要亲自执行，可能看到一个不错的团队，把自己的想法输出，一块做。\n* 创业：九死一生，风险高，需要几乎十项全能。\n* 投资：十个项目，一个走出来就赚钱了。\n\n> **重仓某项目 or 广撒网？**\n\n* 选赛道很重要：过去很多细分赛道都是坑，很多都不了了之了。\n* 赛道内赛手很重要：很难说哪个赛手能跑出来。因此在同一个赛道之内，不要做太多选择，整个赛道都撒一点。\n  * 刚进圈子的时候：不能都撒一点，不做选择，资金实力不允许，最好all iin。14年我只看好以太坊。\n  * 当下：市场有噪音，只要是优秀的项目都要去支持一下。支持一个赛道的多个赛手，可以做大赛道，对赛道本身（如公链本身）有好处。\n\n> **你今天还认为fat protocol成立吗。2019年fat protocal的作者Joel Monegro认为它已经不hold true了。我的观点是，随着协议层起来以后，上面的这些应用会捕获更多价值。但是胖协议当时原本说的是什么？它认为绝大多数协议的绝大多数价值会捕获在协议层，而不是应用层。**\n\n* 我支持胖协议的观点，如果是错的，那么所谓相反的所谓“瘦协议”就是对的，对行业会有方向性指导。\n\n> **在开放金融、基础设施方面，有哪些潜在的新机会？**\n\n* 现在，看以太坊的借贷、稳定币、智能理财的头部，然后依葫芦画瓢，投其中类似的东西，创新稍微放缓了。\n* DeFi最大的问题：怎么做更大的user adoption？比如MetaMask，首先，怎么避免电脑不中毒，把私钥或助记词读出来？第二，硬件钱包这一层，怎么操作？助记词怎么保存?这只是入口层面。进一步的，里面的操作更加复杂，UE标准不一样，未来有没有人来统一DeFi中的UI界面？未来主要是流量这一块。现在主要是区块链原住民从A链到B链，从B链到C链，都是一拨人。\n\n> **还有资本效率问题，比如AMM的滑点。那么你觉得在基础设施方面有哪些机会呢？**\n\n* 我也很纠结。DeFi这波满足了造富的刚需，无论是创始人还是参与者，motivation很强；但是对于基础设施，早期、规模化之前很难赚钱，需要大的资金支持，前面几年不赚钱，只有到后期成为海量用户的入口才有回报。\n* 极致体验也是一个方面，也是流量方面。需求在，场景在，但是选择太多了，比如桥。我觉得最终可能是winner takes all的结局？\n\n> **Super App主要还是在亚洲，美国还是不太一样，跟用户习惯可能有关，但确实在美国没发生。你觉得人在硅谷会有什么不一样的感受？还是网络一线牵，实际上没有什么信息的差距了。**\n\n* 几乎没有信息差，但是有时差。\n\n> **回顾过去3-5年，有没有错过什么项目是让你非常遗憾的？**\n\n* 也许是我的欲望不强，我会觉得能走到今天，中间有很多运气成分，我是很感恩的。\n\n> **OpenSea的成功很大程度上取决于它足够早，且活下来了，且在合约上面写得挺好的，建立了规模效应。**\n\n* NFT是我花最长的时间去调节自己的认知，去理解它，重新去认可它以及去想他的这个背后的逻辑。我觉得在时间上是没有任何一个比这个更烧脑的。\n\n> **回顾年初，那时候你对这一年的展望，有没有哪些事情是你完全没有料到的？**\n\n* 惊喜不断。\n* 极其无聊：行业成熟了。", "timestamp": 1633768073, "digest": "dYTt9dN3clux5YVqxB7wH1ARLRZk2hTqSlB1w5kWNJ4", "contributor": "0x1D42eBAcc4Adb4296080B0C15fB4C3a1d0e0e792"}

Spartan Advisory includes multiple businesses such as Fundraising, M\\&A, and strategic consulting. The M\\&A business once led the acquisition of Blockfolio and FTX.\n*   In 2018, I entered the crypto industry full-time. Joined The Spartan Group in May 2018 and became the first employee in its Hong Kong office. I met Kelvin Koh by chance. I met Casper and Melody (the founder of The Spartan Group) through a friend, and then I met Kelvin through them. At that time, the fund had just been established and its own legal structure had just been set up.\n\n> **Why is the name of the fund called Spartan?**\n\n*   Spartan represents the culture of warriors, with qualities such as perseverance and high discipline.\n*   The fund was established in 2018. At that time, only a few traditional capital market investors entered the crypto field, which meant a sense of rebellion.\n\n> **How has your podcast experience helped you in your investment career?**\n\n*   Harry Stebbings did The Twenty Minute VC when I first wanted to do podcast. This model brought him many benefits:\n\n    *   He has access to almost all large-scale VCs in the world, and many institutions later became his LPs.\n    *   Established a huge social network with the founder.\n    *   Provides an exposure platform for the invested company.\n\n*   At first I was interested in a lot of content in the crypto field, so I read a lot of medium articles. Later I started to want to communicate with the authors, but obviously they are busy, so I need a reason for them to be willing to sit down and talk with me, for example, I can bring them exposure, and they just need to sit down and talk with me One hour and let me ask any questions I want. I contacted a lot of people through cold email, very, very lucky, Adam Draper and many others came to my podcast, and finally I got to where I am today by doing this.\n\n> **This reminds me of what Marc Andreessen said \"We are not an investment firm. We're actually a media company.\"**\n>\n> **Talk about DeFi Venture Fund!**\n\n*   Background of the establishment of the fund:\n\n    *   Spartan was originally a crypto hedge fund, which means that we have a flexible investment strategy. We can buy tokens directly from exchanges, buy tokens through OTC, or invest directly in the project team. At the same time, we can execute transactions for 1-2 weeks, as well as Can not withdraw for many years.\n    *   When we look at it from a long-term perspective, we find that alpha usually comes from the core team that started betting on the crypto field in the early stage, and established contact with them from the early stage.\n    *   We realize that our main fund has invested too many early projects that need to be held for a long time, which reduces the liquidity of our fund. Therefore, we want to build an independent tool that allows us to hold early projects patiently for 3-5 years.\n    *   We have raised 50 million US dollars. Usually a project invests 250,000 to 500,000 US dollars. If the project is really great and we want to lead the investment, we may invest a larger amount.\n\n*   Why is DeFi?\n\n    *   We realize that although there are many really explosive ideas and ideas that change the world, these ideas are related to the decentralized Internet in web 3 and world computer. Many of these things may still exist in 5-10 years, and what we see today are products that users are actually paying for, and these product forms are still in the early stages, which means that there is still strong demand on the user side.\n\n> **We (Multicoin Cap) have a common experience. I remember that as early as 2017, Multicoin was also established as a hedge fund. Later, until the end of 2018, the market was actually not good at that point in time, but there were also some investment opportunities. So at that time we decided to establish this Oppotunity Fund, because essentially there are many interesting small opportunities in the market. Then we started to run two funds at the same time, namely the main fund and the venture fund, so the essence is very similar to your experience.**\n>\n> **Next, I want to talk more about your standards. When you look at the project, what factors do you consider? What are some of the qualities you are looking for?**\n\n*   Long-term view. Because we are investing in the early stage, the founder is very important. Most importantly, we are very curious about the founder's motivation to start a business. Because in encryption technology. You often get promises of quick rewards. We want to make sure that the founders have a very long-term vision, not speculators.\n\n*   Fundamental innovation. We are not looking for teams that make marginal improvements on existing technologies. We are trying to find people who want to create innovative products that may define the development of the industry.\n\n*   Ability to quickly PMF and rapid iteration. The founder must have a big enough idea and an idea that can enter the market right now. The entrepreneur’s first ideas are actually secondary. Because of these successful agreements, they rarely develop as they were originally proposed. They always have some kind of change in the middle. Compared with the specific ideas put forward by entrepreneurs in the early days, I am more willing to bet that entrepreneurs have the necessary adaptability and continuous improvement capabilities in the process of enterprise development.\n\n    *   Alpha Finance has such a team. First, the team is top-notch, and secondly, from the initial raised yield farming development to today, the iteration speed is extremely fast.\n\n> **The market misunderstanding and investment logic of the Synthetix project:**\n\n*   Market misunderstanding:\n\n    *   Capital efficiency is too low, severely over-collateralized (750%)\n    *   There is a ponzi risk in the token design.\n\n<!---->\n\n*   Investment logic:\n\n    *   Strong team; product innovation: zero slippage; community: very active; early enough.\n    *   One of the reasons for Paradigm's investment is also because of the active community and excellent team. Everything about the project is based on governance. The active community will remove the parts that they are not interested in, thus making the agreement better.\n\n> **Sushi was also very controversial in the early days. When did you start to look forward to this project?**\n\n*   Team + vision + valuation. The initial use of vampire attacks to attract a large number of TVLs, this stage seems to be just because of the high income brought by sushi's inflation, rather than the actual use of the token. Until we discovered that the team is actually building a rich roadmap and actively pushing forward, they don't just want to make a copy of uniswap, but want to make a community version of uniswap, which makes us excited. On the other hand, because today uniswap generates a lot of trading fees, but these fees have nothing to do with token holders, so uni is only used for governance purposes. But sushi token holders probably earn 30% of the income from earning trading fees. Yesterday they made 15 million dollars in income, and in the past 30 days they earned 45 billion dollars in income, part of which was distributed to token holders. Based on the revenue and token model, we believe that the value of sushi is seriously underestimated. Sushi served the crowd that uni did not serve well.\n\n*   Sushi’s approach to the community also reflects some of the differences between the traditional VC perspective and the crypto VC perspective of startups (traditional VC mentality vs crypto VC mentality):\n\n    *   traditional: Does not support the idea of ​​start-ups paying dividends from equity on the first day. On the contrary, start-ups will say that everything they earn is reinvested in developing themselves, which makes sense for expanding their business.\n    *   crypto: For DeFi startups, token holders are valuable, and they need to be given some incentives from fees or other aspects. One of the core reasons for token holders to participate in the project is to expect that when the protocol grows up, they will be rewarded for their early contributions. But I think the agreement should give their users incentives and feedback in real time (not after they grow up). This is an important part of promoting community governance. Taking Sushi as an example, we can see that the Sushi community is very active and effective.\n\n> **This is a bit like the question of whether there is a chicken or an egg first. Some people think that if you want to guide and build a strong community, first you need to have a community and earn a lot of money for yourself in order to give the community rewards. But at the same time, some people think that early token holders should be linked as soon as possible, so that they can make a lot of money instead of themselves, they will become more loyal, and then they will continue to hold tokens, and the community will become more and more. powerful.**\n\n*   Yes, making your early holders (especially non-private round early investors) rich is important to the development history of the protocol and the community, especially for those who rely heavily on community development, do not have a core team, or tend to In terms of decentralized governance agreements.\n\n> **Which projects you have missed that impressed you?**\n\n*   The biggest regret is that I missed the FTX of the private placement round. At that time, FTX was only on BP, and we doubted whether a new exchange could gain a share in the fierce competition. And because of the relationship between Alameda and FTX, we are not sure whether he has his own market maker. At the time we thought it didn't make sense, but it proved us wrong. Now almost all of my transactions are done on FTX. Their work with Serum is also impressive.\n\n> **What characteristics do you think can attract founders to accept your investment?**\n\n*   There are not many outstanding funds driven by underlying technology that are completely based in Southeast Asia.\n*   We are DeFI users and have rich experience in DeFi use and investment. Traditional VCs may not allow them to experience these products in depth, but we are crypto natives.\n*   We are the media partner of start-ups and are very active on various social platforms. We try to help our project acquire their first users in the early stage.\n*   When our investment portfolio encounters a crisis, we can be the first person to call for help. We hope to be able to help those who have been voted for a crisis in the shortest possible time.\n\n> **In addition to Ethereum, what other ecosystems are you optimistic about?**\n\n*   Polkadot. We are early investors of Polkadot, and there are many developers who hope to build an ecosystem on Polkadot, such as Acala, a project we invested in **.**\n*   Solana, and serum.\n\n> **How to watch Binance Smart Chain? We see that many projects will initially choose to go online on BSC because the cost is relatively low. If they find that the market demand is confirmed, they may expand to more ecosystems.**\n\n*   From pancakeswap or venus, we can indeed find that they are currently PMF (product market fit), but it will take time to prove.\n\n> **What big opportunities do you think DeFi will have in the next phase?**\n\n*   In mortgage products, the mortgage rate is too high and the capital efficiency is low, and efficiency needs to be improved, such as Alpha Finance or CREAM.\n*   In order to introduce more traditional capital market investors, fixed income needs to be increased and risk tranching is required, such as Saffron Finance.\n*   Super App, such as 1inch.\n\n***Part II***\n\n时间：2021.02.28\n\n访谈人：Mable Jiang（Multicoin Capital）， Jason Choi（The Spartan Group）\n\n> **嘉宾介绍**\n\n*   The Spartan Group基本上包含两个独立企业，Spartan Advisory和Digital Asset Management Fund。Spartan Advisory包含Fundraising、M\\&A、战略咨询等多个业务，M\\&A业务曾主导Blockfolio与FTX的并购案。\n*   2018年我全职进入crypto行业。2018年5月加入The Spartan Group，成为其香港办公室的第一名员工。我通过偶然的机会认识了Kelvin Koh。我通过一个朋友认识了Casper和Melody（The Spartan Group的创始人），然后通过他们认识了Kelvin。那时候基金刚刚成立，刚搭建起自己的法律架构。\n\n> **基金名称为什么叫Spartan？**\n\n*   Spartan代表着勇士文化，有着不屈不挠、高度纪律性等品质。\n*   基金2018年成立，那时候只有很少的传统资本市场投资人进入crypto领域，有一种反叛的意味。\n\n> **你的podcast经历给你的投资生涯给予了哪些帮助？**\n\n*   我开始想做podcast的时候Harry Stebbings做了The Twenty Minute VC，这个模型给他带来了很多好处：\n\n    *   他能接触到世界上几乎所有的大型VC，后来很多机构成为了他的LP。\n    *   与创始人建立了巨大的社交网络。\n    *   为被投公司提供了一个曝光的平台。\n\n*   最开始我对crypto领域的大量内容都感兴趣，因此我阅读了大量的medium文章。后来我开始想跟作者们进行交流，但是很显然他们贼忙，因此我需要一个理由让他们愿意与我坐下来聊聊，比如我能给他们带来曝光，而他们只需要跟我坐下来聊一小时并让我问任何我想问的问题。我通过cold email联系了很多人，非常非常幸运，Adam Draper等等很多人来到了我的podcast，最后通过做到这些我走到了今天。\n\n> **这让我想到了Marc Andreessen说的“We are not an investment firm. We're actually a media company.”**\n>\n> **聊聊DeFi Venture Fund吧！**\n\n*   基金成立的背景：\n\n    *   Spartan最初是一家crypto hedge fund，这意味着我们有灵活的投资策略，可以直接从交易所购买token、可以通过OTC购买token或者直接投资项目团队，同时我们既可以执行1-2周的交易，亦可以多年不退出。\n    *   当我们从长期的角度看时，我们发现alpha通常来自早期开始押注crypto领域的核心团队，从早期便与他们建立联系。\n    *   我们意识到我们的main fund投了太多需要长期持有的早期项目，这让我们基金的流动性降低，因此我们想建立一个独立的工具让我们能耐心持有早期项目3-5年。\n    *   我们募集了5000万美元，通常一个项目投资25万-50万美元，如果项目真的很棒我们想领投的话，我们可能会投更大的金额。\n\n*   为什么是DeFi？\n\n    *   我们意识到，虽然有很多真正爆炸性的想法和改变世界的想法，这些想法与web 3和world computer中的去中心化互联网有关。许多这些事情可能在5-10年后仍然存在，而我们今天看到的是用户实际上在付费使用的产品，而这些产品形态还处于早期，这意味着在用户端仍有强劲的需求。\n\n> **我们（Multicoin Cap）有着共同的经历。我记得早在2017年，Multicoin也是作为hedge fund成立的。后来直到2018年末，那个时间点实际上市场不太好，但是同样有一些投资机会存在。所以在那个时候我们决定建立这个Oppotunity Fund，因为本质上市场中有很多有趣的小机会。然后我们便开始同时运行两个基金，分别是main fund和venture fund，所以本质上与你们的经历非常相似。**\n>\n> **接下来，我想多谈谈你们的标准。当你看项目时，你考虑的因素是什么？你寻找的一些品质是什么？**\n\n*   Long-term view。因为我们投的是早期阶段，创始人很重要。最重要的是，我们对创始人创业的动机非常好奇。因为在加密技术中。你经常得到快速得到回报的允诺。我们想确保创始人有非常长远的眼光，而不是投机分子。\n\n*   Fundamental innovation。我们不是想找在现有技术上进行边际改进的团队，我们正在努力寻找那些想打造创新产品的人，这些产品可能将定义行业的发展。\n\n*   快速PMF、快速迭代的能力。founder既要有一个足够大的想法，也要有一个能在当下打入市场的想法。企业家的第一个想法实际上是次要的，因这些成功的协议，它们很少像最初提出的那样发展。它们总是在中间有某种变化。相比企业家们早期提出的具体想法，我更愿意赌企业家拥有企业发展过程中必须的应变和持续改进能力。\n\n    *   Alpha Finance就拥有这样一支队伍。首先团队顶级，其次从最初的leveraged yield farming发展到今天，迭代速度极快。\n\n> **Synthetix 项目的市场误读和投资逻辑：**\n\n*   市场误读：\n\n    *   资本效率过低，严重超额抵押（750%）\n    *   代币设计中存在ponzi风险。\n\n<!---->\n\n*   投资逻辑：\n\n    *   团队强；产品创新：零滑点；社区：非常活跃；足够早期。\n    *   Paradigm投资的原因其中之一也是因为活跃的社区和优秀的团队，项目的一切都是基于治理的，活跃的社区将会剔除他们不感兴趣的部分，从而使协议变得更好。\n\n> **Sushi在早期也是很有争议的，你们什么时候开始看好这个项目的？**\n\n*   团队+愿景+估值。最初采用吸血鬼攻击吸引了大量的TVL，这个阶段看起来仅仅是因为sushi的inflation带来的高收益，而不是token的实际用途。直到我们发现团队实际上正在构建丰富的路线图并积极推进，他们不是只想做一个uniswap的拷贝，而是想做一个社区版本的uniswap，这令我们感到兴奋。另一方面，因为今天uniswap产生了很多的trading fees，但是这些fees与代币持有者无关，因此uni仅仅用作治理用途。但是sushi的代币持有者大概从赚取trading fees中赚取30%的收益。昨天他们赚取了1500万美元的收入，过去30天他们赚取了450亿美元的收入，这其中的一部分分发给了代币持有者。基于收入和代币模型，我们认为sushi的价值是被严重低估的。Sushi服务了uni没有服务好的人群。\n\n*   sushi对社区的做法也体现了传统VC视角和crypto VC视角下初创企业的一些不同（traditional VC mentality vs crypto VC mentality）：\n\n    *   traditional：不支持初创企业第一天就从股权中支付股息的想法。相反，初创企业会讲他们赚取的一切再投资于发展自身，这对扩大业务是有意义的。\n    *   crypto：对于DeFi初创企业来说，token holder是有价值的，需要给予他们一些来自手续费或者其他方面的激励。token holder参与到项目中的核心原因之一是期待这个协议长大之后会因为他们早期做出的贡献给予他们奖励。但我认为协议应该实时给予他们的用户以激励和反馈（而不是长大之后），这是促进社区治理的重要组成部分，以Sushi为例可以看到Sushi的社区是非常活跃且有效的。\n\n> **这有点像先有鸡还是先有蛋的问题。有些人认为，如果你要引导并建立一个强大的社区，首先你需要有一个社区同时自己赚很多钱，才能给予社区奖励。但同时另一些人认为应该尽早链接早期的代币持有者，让他们而非自己赚很多钱，他们就会变得更加忠诚，然后他们会继续持有代币，社区因此变得越来越强大。**\n\n*   是的，让你的早期持有者（尤指非私募轮的早期投资者）变得富有对于协议和社区的发展史很重要的，尤其是对于那些十分依靠社区发展、没有核心团队或者倾向于去中心化治理的协议来说。\n\n> **哪些你曾经miss掉的项目令你印象深刻？**\n\n*   最大的遗憾是错过私募轮的FTX。那时候FTX还只是在BP上，我们怀疑一家新的交易所能否在激烈的竞争中取得份额。并且由于Alameda和FTX的关系，我们不确定他拥有自己的做市商这件事是否成立。当时我们认为这不make sense，但是后来证明我们错了。现在我几乎所有的交易都在FTX上完成。他们与Serum的工作也令人印象深刻。\n\n> **你觉得你们的哪些特质能够吸引创始人接受你们的投资？**\n\n*   没有很多底层技术驱动的优秀基金完全base在东南亚。\n*   我们本身是DeFI用户，有着丰富的DeFi使用和投资经验，传统VC可能不允许他们去深度感受这些产品，但是我们是crypto native。\n*   我们是初创企业的media partner，在各个社交平台上非常活跃，我们试图在早期帮助我们的项目获取他们的第一批用户。\n*   我们的投资组合遇到危机时，我们可以成为他们第一个打电话求助的人，我们希望能够在最短的时间内帮助被投读过危机。\n\n> **除了以太坊，还有哪些生态是你们看好的？**\n\n*   Polkadot。我们是波卡的早期投资者，有很多开发者希望在波卡上建立生态，比如我们投资的一个项目Acala**。**\n*   Solana，以及serum。\n\n> **如何看Binance Smart Chain？我们看到有很多项目最初会选择在BSC上线，因为费用较为低廉，如果发现市场需求被印证了，他们可能会拓展到更多的生态中。**\n\n*   从pancakeswap或者venus确实可以发现他们当下是PMF（product market fit）的，但还需要时间来证明。\n\n> **你们认为DeFi下一阶段会有哪些大的机会？**\n\n*   在抵押产品中，抵押率过高，资本效率较低，需要提高效率，比如Alpha Finance或者CREAM。\n*   为了引入更多的传统资本市场的投资者，需要增加固定收益，需要进行风险分级（risk tranching），比如Saffron Finance。\n*   Super App，比如1inch。\n\n‌\n", "timestamp": 1633768251, "digest": "2FcK6jFrNrQqmB6u4t7oCLTckGL0kL1slHTLSqgOPSg", "contributor": "0x1D42eBAcc4Adb4296080B0C15fB4C3a1d0e0e792"}

He is currently responsible for the entire investment sector of Binance, including M\\&A, Binance Lab and Binance Launch Pad.\n\n> **After leaving school and returning to Beijing, what were your thoughts at the time?**\n\n*   In my senior year, I had contact with venture capital companies in Beijing. A very big touch for me in the United States is that many students who studied abroad in the past hope to stay in the United States after completing their studies and find a relatively stable job or a job in a large company. But when I was in school, I felt a big touch to me was that at that time I participated in some of our school's clubs, including MIT-CHIEF, and some of the activities of these organizations in harvard. The biggest feeling for me is that at that time we invited many domestic entrepreneurs to the United States to talk about their entrepreneurial experiences. I found that a more obvious trend is that in the past, many overseas students may choose to stay after graduation. But since then I have seen a more obvious change. Many overseas students are more willing to choose to return to China to start a business after completing their studies. I think in the past two years of 15/16, for the entire Chinese venture capital circle, I felt the rise of a very strong venture capital atmosphere. During the period, I met the CEO of my last company. At that time, I was moved by his vision and pursuit of technology, so I decided to return to Beijing to join this startup.\n\n> **It's actually quite touching for me, because we two should have graduated from undergraduate at the same time.**\n>\n> **Can you tell us why you chose Binance at that time?**\n\n*   The vision of the founder (cz, He Yi): freedom of money.\n*   Globalization: No industry is as global as the blockchain industry from day one.\n*   Disruptive: No other industry has ever challenged today's financial order from the foundation like the blockchain, and it may even affect the pattern of international finance.\n*   The team is young and strong: When joining Binance, the transaction volume and user scale have grown to a relatively top position, probably No.1 or No.2, but after joining the company, I found that the entire team is less than 100 people. And so far, the average age of our entire team is under 30. This is a very dynamic, thoughtful and effective team.\n*   In the second half of 2017, Binance made a decisive and significant decision to focus on overseas markets, so at that time we quickly moved the domestic team to overseas headquarters. Later, we actually didn't have the concept of the so-called headquarters, because the team was very decentralized.\n\n> **What stages has Binance gone through to this day? In each stage, what are the main growth points you see?**\n\n*   Product aspect: From pure ToC products to ToB field gradually.\n\n    *   2017-2019:\n\n        *   ToC. From the perspective of C-end products, we have moved from only providing spot transactions to now gradually building an end-to-end user service system. In the second half of 2019, we established a channel for buying currency with legal currency, and launched derivatives trading markets, wealth management products, and staking. A series of C-end product functions were completed in the second half of 2019.\n        *   Consolidate the market share of the mainstream market.\n\n    <!---->\n\n    *   2020:\n\n        *   Explore ToB business. Including broker, Binance Card, etc.\n        *   Exploring the growth space of emerging markets, including Latin America, Southeast Asia and India, we provide services to local users in different ways in these markets, such as WazirX in India, which is the No.1 local trading platform we acquired at the end of 2019 , Today has grown into India’s No.1 exchange; we incubated and invested in Africa’s No.1 wallet; and invested in Indonesia’s first compliant exchange in Indonesia.\n\n> **From a macro perspective, what are the general directions Binance has done right?**\n\n*   In terms of values, users are paramount. To give a small example, everyone will say that our co-founder sister is the chief customer service, because she is real, and none of us know when she will take a break. Because as long as users have any feedback about the product in different groups or communities, you can see that the first sister will respond or answer in time, or relay the corresponding suggestions to our product managers.\n\n*   Do the right thing at the right time. For example, Binance only started to launch derivatives trading in the second half of 2019. But before that, most trading platforms already had functions and services for derivatives trading. But before that, our internal team had always believed that we needed to maximize the user experience of spot trading until we felt more satisfied and stable, and then we would go further to make other products.\n\n*   End-to-end closed-loop user experience.\n\n    *   Solve the problem of buying and depositing coins. At present, we cover the purchase service of legal currency in more than 40 countries around the world on the main website.\n    *   Different wallets have been incubated and invested in the ecological field as entry-level products for Xiaobai users.\n\n> **What are the core acquisitions in 2020? Binance's three major footholds for strategic investment and mergers and acquisitions in 2019-2020**\n\n*   Expansion of new markets.\n\n    *   Latin America, Southeast Asia, India, etc.\n\n*   The establishment of a new product line.\n\n    *   Sometimes internal resources are relatively tight, and investment and mergers and acquisitions are used to quickly promote the online business.\n    *   In the second half of 2019, a team was acquired, and later the team was mainly responsible for the construction of Binance Cloud.\n    *   Acquired the wallet company Swipe and now it becomes the leading team of Binance Card.\n    *   Acquired DappReview, the leading data platform for decentralized applications in China at that time, and now the founder of DappReview is leading the CoinMarketCap product.\n\n*   Acquisition of new users.\n\n    *   Swipe: Their users are spending cryptocurrency when they swipe visa or mastercard.\n    *   Travala: Provides services in the field of crypto-based travel.\n\n> **What are the new strategic goals for 2021?**\n\n*   Based on the scale and speed of institutional admissions in the second half of 2020, we may make further investment arrangements in institutional business.\n*   token: Focusing on the development of DeFi, Binance Smart Chain was launched in the second half of 2020.\n*   From making products to making ecology.\n*   Polkadot ecology. We recognize that the launch of Polkadot and the development of technology will have more positive impacts on the entire blockchain industry, which is parallel to our BSC investment.\n\n> **Before in 2019, you launched Binance Chain and Binance Dex. At that time, you should be more focused on the DEX itself. So what kind of opportunity did you decide to embrace the decentralized ecology and become a BSC that can be evm? Some people would think that a centralized exchange to do a decentralized chain is actually destroying its own life. Because there is so much liquidity, doing business on the chain will inevitably affect the business of the exchange.**\n\n*   Binance's goal is not to be a leading exchange, we hope to be an industry infrastructure provider. We acquired Trust Wallet, a decentralized open source wallet, in 2018. This is our first step on the road to decentralization. Binance Dex and Binance Chain are the second step on our road to decentralization. We don't feel that we are reviving our own lives. We feel that in the process of building industry infrastructure, with the gradual improvement and maturity of the infrastructure, we will move further towards our goal.\n\n> **Have you considered how to combine the advantages of centralized exchanges, and then to better serve the finance on the chain?**\n\n*   Regarding supporting the ecological construction on the chain:\n\n    *   Investment perspective:\n\n        *   accelerator fund, which supports early projects willing to come to BSC in the form of seed funds.\n        *   Liquidity program, we will inject liquidity into the better DeFi projects on BSC.\n        *   The builder program, based on the monthly growth of the project and the contribution to the entire transaction volume of BSC, will share the handling fee with the builder.\n\n    <!---->\n\n    *   Product perspective: How to integrate CeFi and DeFi? There are several starting points:\n\n        *   How to lower the threshold for users to participate in DeFi.\n        *   How to integrate the existing better CeFi experience into DeFi products? For example, we have built a launchpool platform to help users participate in farming on a centralized exchange. After BSC went online, we matched the cooperation between DEX and launchpool on BSC. For example, while users are mining new tokens on centralized exchanges, we also synchronize ifo on pancakeswap or bakeryswap on BSC. This is a typical How do we educate and guide users to participate in DeFi.\n        *   Combine centralized user groups and decentralized products. Designed mainly from the wallet entrance, such as Trust Wallet, Math Wallet, etc., to help users transition from CeFi to DeFi.\n\n> **I had known Maizi a long time ago, but then what really inspired me to think it was worth investing was a small point: at that time there was an asset called Rune on Binance Dex. I wanted to try Binance Dex to see if it worked. I found that only Math Wallet integrates tron ​​and eos chains. Then I realized that maybe for a user, he needs a front end that integrates a variety of commonly used chains and solves the last mile problem.**\n>\n> **Today we released the news of Binance's investment in Multicoin. First of all, thank you very much. Then I would like to take this opportunity to ask, because this is your first investment fund project. I want to know why you want to invest in a fund, and what is the synergy effect for you?**\n\n*   We have several expectations for fund projects:\n\n    *   Early opportunity capture. We hope to gather more outstanding forces in the industry to shape the ecology. For example, in terms of project mining, we still have room for improvement in the discovery of earlier projects, but Multicoin can use its own advantages to make up for these shortcomings.\n    *   Added value after casting.\n    *   The investment ecology is complementary and develops together.\n\n> **What do you think of the current macro environment?**\n\n*   Challenges and opportunities coexist.\n\n    *   Opportunity: Mainstream financial institutions are constantly entering the market, and they can help make the industry bigger.\n\n    <!---->\n\n    *   Challenge: Competition becomes more intense.\n\n***Part II***\n\n时间：2021.03.02\n\n访谈人：Mable Jiang（Multicoin Capital），Ling Zhang（Binance）\n\n> **嘉宾背景**\n\n*   北大国际政治经济和工商管理本科，哈佛肯尼迪学院公共政策硕士，后休学，加入了一家Google投资的AI公司。\n*   2018年3月左右加入Binance Lab，2019年下半年进入M\\&A业务，目前负责Binance整个投资板块，包括M\\&A、Binance Lab和Binance Launch Pad。\n\n> **休学回到北京，当时的想法是什么呢？**\n\n*   大四接触过在北京的创投公司。在美国给我一个非常大的触动是，过去很多出国念书的学生，很多在学成之后都希望留在美国，找一份比较稳定的或者在大公司的工作。可是在我上学的时候，我觉得给我一个很大的触动是，那个时候我参加了一些我们学校的社团，包括像 MIT-CHIEF，还有 harvard 的一些这些组织的活动。给我一个最大的感受是那个时候我们邀请了很多国内的创业者到美国来讲述他们的创业经历。我发现比较明显的一个趋势是，在过去很多的海外的学子可能都选择毕业之后要留下来。但是从那个时候我就看到了一个比较明显的变化，很多的海外留学生更愿意选择在学成之后回国创业。我觉得15/16年这两年，对于整个中国的创投圈来说，我感觉到了非常浓厚的创投氛围的兴起。期间我遇到了我上一个公司的 CEO，当时被他对于技术的理想和追求所打动，所以我决定选择回到北京，加入这家初创公司。\n\n> **对我其实挺有感触的，因为咱们俩应该是同一个时间本科毕业的。**\n>\n> **能不能介绍一下为什么当时会选择了Binance？**\n\n*   创始人（cz，何一）的愿景：freedom of money。\n*   全球化：没有一个行业像区块链这个行业一样从第一天起就是全球化的。\n*   颠覆性：从没有一个其他行业像区块链一样从基础上挑战今天的金融秩序，甚至有可能影响国际金融的格局。\n*   团队年轻强悍：加入Binance时交易量、用户规模等已经增长到比较顶尖的位置了，大概是No.1或者No.2，但是加入公司后我发现整个团队还不到100人。并且至今为止，我们整个团队的平均年龄都在 30 岁以下，这是一个非常有活力有想法且有执行力的团队。\n*   2017年下半年Binance做出了一个具有决定性意义的重大决定，专注做海外市场，所以那个时候我们把国内的团队迅速的搬往了海外总部。到后来我们其实已经没有所谓的总部的概念了，因为团队非常的去中心化。\n\n> **Binance成长到今天都经历了哪些阶段？在每一个阶段里面，你看到的主要增长点分别是什么呢？**\n\n*   产品方面：从纯粹的 ToC 产品逐渐向 ToB 领域涉足。\n\n    *   2017-2019年：\n\n        *   ToC。从 C 端产品看，我们从仅提供现货交易，到现在逐渐的去打造一整套端到端的用户服务体系。我们在 19 年下半年搭建了法币买币的渠道，并推出了衍生品交易市场、理财产品，以及staking等等。一系列的C 端产品功能都是在2019年下半年完成的。\n        *   夯实主流市场的市场份额。\n\n    <!---->\n\n    *   2020 年：\n\n        *   探索ToB业务。包括broker、Binance Card等。\n        *   挖掘新兴市场成长空间，包括拉美、东南亚和印度，我们在这几个市场通过不同的方式给当地用户提供服务，比如印度的WazirX，这是我们2019年年末收购的当地的No.1的交易平台，今天已成长为印度No.1的交易所；我们孵化和投资了非洲No.1的钱包；在印尼投资了印尼第一家合规的交易所。\n\n> **从宏观角度，Binance哪些大方向上做对了？**\n\n*   价值观方面，用户至上。举个小例子，大家都会说我们的 co-founder 一姐是首席客服，因为她是真的，我们大家都不知道什么时间她会休息。因为只要用户在不同的群里或者社区有任何关于产品的反馈，你都能看到一姐会及时去响应或者解答，或者把相应的建议转述给我们的产品经理。\n\n*   对的时间做对的事。比如 2019 年下半年时Binance才开始推出衍生品交易。可是在这之前，大部分的交易平台已经有提供衍生品交易的功能和服务。但是在那之前我们的内部团队一直认为我们需要把现货交易的用户体验做到极致，直到我们觉得比较满意和稳定的前提下，我们再去进一步的去做其他的产品。\n\n*   端到端的闭环用户体验。\n\n    *   解决了买币和存币问题。目前在主站上我们覆盖了全球 40 多个国家的法币的购买服务。\n    *   在生态领域里孵化投资了不同的钱包，作为小白用户的入门级的产品。\n\n> **2020年的核心收购案是什么？Binance 2019-2020年战略投资和并购的三大立足点**\n\n*   新市场的拓展。\n\n    *   拉美、东南亚、印度等。\n\n*   新产品线的搭建。\n\n    *   有时候内部资源较为紧张，会使用投资并购的方式快速推进业务的上线。\n    *   2019年下半年收购了一个团队，后来该团队主要负责币安云的搭建。\n    *   收购钱包公司Swipe，现在成了Binance Card的主导团队。\n    *   收购DappReview，当时国内比较领先的去中心化应用的数据平台，现在DappReview的创始人主导CoinMarketCap这个产品。\n\n*   新用户的获取。\n\n    *   Swipe：他们的用户在刷visa或者mastercard的时候就在消费加密货币。\n    *   Travala：提供基于crypto的出行领域的服务。\n\n> **2021年有哪些新增的战略目标？**\n\n*   基于 2020 年下半年发生的机构入场的规模和速度，我们可能会在机构业务上做出进一步的投资布局。\n*   token：关注DeFi发展，2020年下半年launch了Binance Smart Chain。\n*   从做产品到做生态。\n*   Polkadot生态。我们比较认可接下来波卡的上线以及技术的发展会对整个区块链行业有更多的积极影响，这个跟我们BSC的投资并行。\n\n> **之前在2019年的时候你们launch了Binance Chain、Binance Dex，当时应该比较专注于DEX本身，所以后来是一个什么样的契机决定拥抱去中心化生态，做了可以evm的BSC的？有人会认为一个中心化的交易所去做去中心化的链，实际上是在革自己的命。因为流动性就这么多，做了链上业务的话势必会影响到交易所的业务。**\n\n*   Binance的目标不是做一个领先的交易所，我们希望做一个行业基础设施的提供者。我们在2018年收购了去中心化的开源钱包Trust Wallet，这是我们去中心化道路上走的第一步，Binance Dex和Binance Chain是我们去中心化道路的第二步。我们不觉得是在革自己的命，我们觉得是在搭建行业基础设施的过程中，在基础设施逐渐完善和成熟的情况下，我们再进一步走向我们的目标。\n\n> **你们有没有考虑说怎么样去把中心化交易所的优势结合起来，然后去更好的服务链上金融？**\n\n*   关于支持链上生态建设：\n\n    *   投资角度：\n\n        *   accelerator fund，即以种子基金的形式支持愿意来BSC的早期项目。\n        *   liquidity program，我们会给BSC上比较好的DeFi项目注入流动性。\n        *   builder program，根据项目每个月的增长情况和给BSC整个交易量的贡献，把手续费拿出来跟builder分享。\n\n    <!---->\n\n    *   产品角度：如何整合CeFi和DeFi？有几个出发点：\n\n        *   怎么降低用户参与DeFi的门槛。\n        *   怎么把已有的比较好的CeFi体验结合到DeFi产品中。比如我们搭建了launchpool平台，帮助用户在中心化交易所参与farming。等BSC上线后，我们撮合了BSC上的DEX和launchpool的合作，比如用户在中心化交易所在挖新token的同时，我们也在BSC上的pancakeswap或bakeryswap上同步进行ifo，这是一个典型的case我们怎么教育和引导用户去参与到DeFi中。\n        *   结合中心化的用户群体和去中心化的产品。主要从钱包入口进行设计，如Trust Wallet、Math Wallet等，帮助用户从CeFi过度到DeFi。\n\n> **我以前很早就认识麦子了，但是后来真正激发我觉得值得投资的是一个很小的点：当时在 Binance Dex上有一个资产叫 Rune。我当时想尝试用一下Binance Dex 买它看行不行。我发现只有麦子钱包集成了tron、eos这些链。然后我就意识到可能对于一个用户来说，他需要一个集成了各种各样的常用的链的、解决最后一公里问题的前端。**\n>\n> **今天我们发布了Binance投资Multicoin的新闻，首先非常感谢你们。然后我在这里也想借此机会问一下，因为这是你们第一次布局投资基金类的项目。我想知道你们为什么想要去投资一个基金，然后对你们的协同效应是什么呢？**\n\n*   我们对基金类项目有几个期望点：\n\n    *   早期机会捕捉。我们希望聚集更多行业的优秀力量来塑造生态。比如说从项目挖掘来说，我们在更早期的项目的发现上仍然是有提升空间的，但是Multicoin可以发挥自身优势弥补我们的这些不足。\n    *   投后附加值。\n    *   投资生态互补，共同发展。\n\n> **你怎么看待现在的宏观环境？**\n\n*   挑战和机遇并存。\n\n    *   机遇：主流金融机构在不断进入市场，他们能够帮助把行业做大。\n\n    <!---->\n\n    *   挑战：竞争更加激烈。\n", "timestamp": 1633768267, "digest": "27pRsxhMa4B2pkZEKwLXN3YRvvKncOEnocaptmDU1u8", "contributor":

Therefore, within the same track, don't make too many choices. Sprinkle a little on the entire track.\n  * When you first entered the circle: you can't just sprinkle a little, don't make a choice, the financial strength is not allowed, it is best to all iin. In 14 years, I am only optimistic about Ethereum.\n  * Now: There is noise in the market, as long as it is an excellent project, we must support it. Multiple racers who support a track can be a big track, which is good for the track itself (such as the public chain itself).\n\n> **Do you still think the fat protocol is established today? Joel Monegro, the author of fat protocal in 2019, believes that it no longer holds true. My point is that as the protocol layer rises, the above applications will capture more value. But what did the fat agreement originally say? It believes that most of the value of most protocols will be captured at the protocol layer, not the application layer.**\n\n* I support the view of the fat agreement. If it is wrong, then the so-called \"thin agreement\" in the opposite direction is right, and it will give direction to the industry.\n\n> **In terms of open finance and infrastructure, what are the potential new opportunities?**\n\n* Now, looking at the heads of Ethereum's lending, stablecoins, and smart financial management, and then drawing on the gourd and investing in similar things, innovation has slowed down a bit.\n* DeFi's biggest problem: how to do bigger user adoption? For example, MetaMask, first of all, how to prevent the computer from being poisoned and read out the private key or mnemonic? Second, how to operate the hardware wallet layer? How to save the mnemonic words? This is only the entry level. Furthermore, the operations inside are more complicated and the UE standard is different. Will anyone come to unify the UI interface in DeFi in the future? The future is mainly traffic. At present, it is mainly the indigenous people of the blockchain, from the A chain to the B chain, from the B chain to the C chain, they are all a group of people.\n\n> **There are also capital efficiency issues, such as the slippage of AMM. So what do you think are the opportunities in infrastructure?**\n\n* I am also very entangled. This wave of DeFi satisfies the rigid need to create wealth. Whether it is a founder or a participant, the motivation is very strong; but for infrastructure, it is difficult to make money in the early stage and before large-scale. It needs large financial support. Later, the entrance to a large number of users will be rewarded.\n* The ultimate experience is also one aspect, but also the traffic aspect. The demand is there, the scene is there, but there are too many choices, such as bridges. I think it might be the ending of winner takes all in the end?\n\n> **Super App is mainly in Asia, and the United States is still different. It may be related to user habits, but it does not happen in the United States. How do you think people feel differently in Silicon Valley? It's still the Internet, and there is actually no information gap anymore.**\n\n* There is almost no information gap, but there is a time gap.\n\n> **Looking back on the past 3-5 years, have you missed any projects that you regret?**\n\n* Maybe it's because my desires are not strong. I think I can go to this day. There are a lot of luck in it. I am very grateful.\n\n> **The success of OpenSea largely depends on it being early enough, surviving, and well written on the contract, establishing a scale effect.**\n\n* NFT is the longest time I spend to adjust my cognition, to understand it, to recognize it again, and to think about the logic behind it. I think there is no one more brain-burning than this in terms of time.\n\n> **Looking back at the beginning of the year, what was your outlook for the year at that time? Are there any things that you didn't expect at all?**\n\n* endless good news.\n* Extremely boring: the industry has matured.\n\n***Part II***\n\n时间：2021.09.27‌\n\n访谈人：Mable Jiang（Multicoin Capital），Xiahong Lin（Continue Capital）\n\n> **您的背景？**\n\n* Continue Capital创始合伙人之一。\n* 17年开始在币圈创业。\n* 之前engineer背景，腾讯，twitter，微软等。\n* 做过几十个不同种类的项目（web、mobile、blockchain）。\n\n> **最近觉得有意思、想做的东西？**\n\n* 最近想做的：\n  * 原来：自己执行，lead团队开始干。\n  * 现在：不一定要亲自执行，可能看到一个不错的团队，把自己的想法输出，一块做。\n* 创业：九死一生，风险高，需要几乎十项全能。\n* 投资：十个项目，一个走出来就赚钱了。\n\n> **重仓某项目 or 广撒网？**\n\n* 选赛道很重要：过去很多细分赛道都是坑，很多都不了了之了。\n* 赛道内赛手很重要：很难说哪个赛手能跑出来。因此在同一个赛道之内，不要做太多选择，整个赛道都撒一点。\n  * 刚进圈子的时候：不能都撒一点，不做选择，资金实力不允许，最好all iin。14年我只看好以太坊。\n  * 当下：市场有噪音，只要是优秀的项目都要去支持一下。支持一个赛道的多个赛手，可以做大赛道，对赛道本身（如公链本身）有好处。\n\n> **你今天还认为fat protocol成立吗。2019年fat protocal的作者Joel Monegro认为它已经不hold true了。我的观点是，随着协议层起来以后，上面的这些应用会捕获更多价值。但是胖协议当时原本说的是什么？它认为绝大多数协议的绝大多数价值会捕获在协议层，而不是应用层。**\n\n* 我支持胖协议的观点，如果是错的，那么所谓相反的所谓“瘦协议”就是对的，对行业会有方向性指导。\n\n> **在开放金融、基础设施方面，有哪些潜在的新机会？**\n\n* 现在，看以太坊的借贷、稳定币、智能理财的头部，然后依葫芦画瓢，投其中类似的东西，创新稍微放缓了。\n* DeFi最大的问题：怎么做更大的user adoption？比如MetaMask，首先，怎么避免电脑不中毒，把私钥或助记词读出来？第二，硬件钱包这一层，怎么操作？助记词怎么保存?这只是入口层面。进一步的，里面的操作更加复杂，UE标准不一样，未来有没有人来统一DeFi中的UI界面？未来主要是流量这一块。现在主要是区块链原住民从A链到B链，从B链到C链，都是一拨人。\n\n> **还有资本效率问题，比如AMM的滑点。那么你觉得在基础设施方面有哪些机会呢？**\n\n* 我也很纠结。DeFi这波满足了造富的刚需，无论是创始人还是参与者，motivation很强；但是对于基础设施，早期、规模化之前很难赚钱，需要大的资金支持，前面几年不赚钱，只有到后期成为海量用户的入口才有回报。\n* 极致体验也是一个方面，也是流量方面。需求在，场景在，但是选择太多了，比如桥。我觉得最终可能是winner takes all的结局？\n\n> **Super App主要还是在亚洲，美国还是不太一样，跟用户习惯可能有关，但确实在美国没发生。你觉得人在硅谷会有什么不一样的感受？还是网络一线牵，实际上没有什么信息的差距了。**\n\n* 几乎没有信息差，但是有时差。\n\n> **回顾过去3-5年，有没有错过什么项目是让你非常遗憾的？**\n\n* 也许是我的欲望不强，我会觉得能走到今天，中间有很多运气成分，我是很感恩的。\n\n> **OpenSea的成功很大程度上取决于它足够早，且活下来了，且在合约上面写得挺好的，建立了规模效应。**\n\n* NFT是我花最长的时间去调节自己的认知，去理解它，重新去认可它以及去想他的这个背后的逻辑。我觉得在时间上是没有任何一个比这个更烧脑的。\n\n> **回顾年初，那时候你对这一年的展望，有没有哪些事情是你完全没有料到的？**\n\n* 惊喜不断。\n* 极其无聊：行业成熟了。", "timestamp": 1633768073, "digest": "dYTt9dN3clux5YVqxB7wH1ARLRZk2hTqSlB1w5kWNJ4", "contributor": "0x1D42eBAcc4Adb4296080B0C15fB4C3a1d0e0e792"}
{"id": "PZMXYtWdLvelkZLUL6RUONQNoqXLc9Vxjd1QZf6iZPA", "title": "[Notes] - Pima: On Continue Capital's Cross-cycle Long Term Strategy", "body": "***Part I: English Version***\n\n***Part II: Chinese Version***\n\n***Part I***\n\nTime: 2021.5.20\n\nInterviewer: Mable Jiang (Multicoin Capital), Pima (Continue Capital)\n\n> **Investment style?**\n\n*   In the past, when the capital was small, 1/3 or even half of the positions were used to invest in some projects.\n\n*   Offense (√) & Defense (×):\n\n    *   Traditional capital market: 10 stocks of public funds, each accounted for no more than 10%, the Sharpe rate is strictly controlled, and the focus is on defense.\n\n    <!---->\n\n    *   Crypto market: Opportunity does not lie in defense, it needs to concentrate funds in the early stage. It is very difficult to make money in a bear market, and the magnitude of the jump is minimal.\n\n*   The benchmarking sentiment is very serious. Taking animal currency as an example, I believe that holding positions can grow into the next bitcoin for 3-5 years. Such a benchmarking logic is inappropriate.\n\n> **Many of the funds that came out of this round are good at asset selection, not all of which are big-cap dividends. How to judge whether a project is expensive or not?**\n\n*   Take the market (Bitcoin) as the coordinate: At different stages, the heat, attention, and amount of funds coming in the market are completely different at different stages.\n*   Head effect: After the top companies eat up the market, the value of the back may be zero. Now it is possible that due to the growth bonus and the number of retail investors, the emotions are easily mobilized. Therefore, there will be a lot of waist and tail items, and there will be a benchmarking emotion. But for example, with Chainlink's dominance on the oracle track, we will hardly look at new opportunities on the oracle track, and it is difficult for new projects to get the market.\n*   Market space: Taking traditional industries as an example, first look at the market space ceiling from the scale of the people served. If it can serve the world's 1 billion people, it can be made into a volume like Facebook, Apple, and Alibaba; if it only covers 10 million people, it will not be possible to give the project such a large industry growth space.\n*   Rely on growth to cover the valuation, rather than simply relying on low cost.\n\n> **What is the investment logic of Dfinity?**\n\n*   Bitcoin, Ethereum, Filecoin, and Dfinity belong to the role of sectarianism.\n*   It is in line with our expectation for the next wave of industry prosperity: what kind of phenomenon should the next wave of industry prosperity present to us? In the past, the direction of technological deduction was monopolized by transactions and smart contracts, but web3 may face many Internet problems. Can using Crypto products be as smooth as using Internet products? This is our expectation for the next round of Dfinity, but this round of ecology may not be affordable, and a lot of common infrastructure needs to be built.\n*   Now it is necessary to reconstruct the industry structure from the basic principles to make a completely subversive product.\n*   I have always believed that the projects and products we invest in can fall in market value, but cannot fall in rankings. The project ranking represents your position and competitiveness in the entire industry. The decline in market value may be related to the cyclical sentiment of the entire market, the Fed and other macroeconomic impacts, but if the project has fallen in the rankings, you should really reflect on it, or it is at odds with the development of the entire era, or The competitiveness of your industry is deteriorating, which I think is not particularly tolerable.\n\n> **Do you think the scale effect is the most important?**\n\n*   is important. For example, if the major urban commercial banks do not cover the population, there are opportunities for the rise of some new projects if they do not cover the scope.\n*   If the new project can serve the vast number of people not covered in the past, and at the same time achieve great product optimization and service innovation to meet the needs of these people, then the new project can rely on the scale effect to take a share of the industry.\n\n> **Uni and Sushi are in sharp contrast in terms of operations. The Sushi team is the most efficient in decentralized operations; everyone in Uni has a clear ownership and understands what they are responsible for, so they push things quickly.**\n>\n> **How to see the development of DEX?**\n\n*   Judgment of DEX's core indicators: TVL, transaction volume, DAU. At the root of each DEX is a high-quality project.\n*   From MetaMask's five or six million downloads and the number of addresses interacting with Ethereum, it can be seen that there are still relatively few players entering DeFi, and DEX still has a lot of room for growth.\n*   DEX is the jewel in the DeFi crown, but the competition is slowly solidifying.\n\n***Part II***\n\n时间：2021.5.20\n\n访谈人：Mable Jiang（Multicoin Capital）, Pima（Continue Capital）\n\n> **投资风格？**\n\n*   以前资金体量小的时候常用1/3甚至一半的仓位投一些项目。\n\n*   进攻(√) & 防守(×)：\n\n    *   传统资本市场：公募基金10支股票，每支占比不超过10%，严格控制夏普率，重点在防守。\n\n    <!---->\n\n    *   Crypto 市场：机会不在于防守，早期需要集中资金。在熊市赚钱是非常难的，数量级的跃升微乎其微。\n\n*   对标情绪很严重，以动物币为例，认为持仓3-5年能成长为下一个bitcoin，这样的对标逻辑是不恰当的。\n\n> **这一轮跑出来的基金很多是善于资产选择的，不全然是大盘红利。怎么判断一个项目贵不贵？**\n\n*   以大盘（Bitcoin）为坐标：在不同阶段，整个市场的热度、关注度、市场进来的资金体量是完全不一样的。\n*   头部效应：头部的几家把市场吃掉之后，后面的价值可能就归0了。现在可能由于成长红利还在，散户还比较多，情绪容易被调动起来，因此腰部尾部项目会非常多，存在对标情绪。但是比如以Chainlink在预言机赛道的统治力，我们在预言机赛道几乎不会去看新的机会了，新项目很难拿到市场。\n*   市场空间：以传统行业为例，从服务的人群规模先看市场空间天花板。如果能服务全球 10 亿人口，那么可以做成 Facebook、苹果、阿里巴巴这种体量；如果只覆盖 1000 万人口，那不可能给到项目那么大的行业的成长空间。\n*   要靠成长去cover掉估值，而不是单纯靠成本低。\n\n> **Dfinity的投资逻辑是怎样的？**\n\n*   Bitcoin、Ethereum、Filecoin、Dfinity属于开宗立派的角色。\n*   符合我们对下一波行业繁荣的一个期待：下一波的行业繁荣，应该是以什么样的现象呈现给我们？过去技术推演的方向被交易和智能合约垄断，但web3可能会面对非常多互联网方面的问题。使用Crypto产品是否能像使用互联网产品一样丝滑？这是我们对Dfinity下一轮的期待，但是这一轮生态不一定起得来，还需要搭建很多通用的基础设施。\n*   现在是需要从基本原理上去重构行业结构才能做出完全颠覆式的产品。\n*   我一直坚信，我们投的项目、投的产品可以跌市值，但是不能跌排名。项目排名代表了你在整个行业的地位与竞争力。跌市值可能跟整个市场的周期情绪、美联储等等宏观经济的影响有关，但如果说项目跌了排名，你真的是应该好好的去做反思，要么跟整个时代的发展有相左之处，要么你的行业竞争力在退化，这个是我觉得不是特别能忍受的。\n\n> **你认为规模效应是最重要的吗？**\n\n*   是重要的。举例来说，主要的城市商行没有覆盖到的人群，没有覆盖到的范围，就存在一些新项目崛起的机会。\n*   新项目如果说能把广大的过去没有覆盖到的人群服务好，同时做到极大的产品优化、服务创新，满足这些人的需求，那么新项目就能依靠规模效应在行业里分一杯羹。\n\n> **Uni与Sushi在运营方面形成了鲜明的对比，Sushi团队在去中心化运营里面是效率最高的；Uni里面每个人有明确的ownership明白自己负责的是什么，所以推东西很快。**\n>\n> **如何看DEX的发展？**\n\n*   DEX的核心指标的判断：TVL、交易额、DAU。每个DEX本源上争抢的是优质项目。\n*   从MetaMask的五六百万的下载量、从跟以太坊交互的地址数等数据可以看出目前进入DeFi的玩家还是比较少的，DEX还有很大的成长空间。\n*   DEX是DeFi皇冠上的明珠，但是竞争已经在慢慢固化。\n", "timestamp": 1633768216, "digest": "aXHEkJeAHWylvMWRsMXdMcSk-oQDiXBv319eVVUDIsg", "contributor": "0x1D42eBAcc4Adb4296080B0C15fB4C3a1d0e0e792"}

Over that time, I've been trying various instruments that have been suggested to me via luthiers, dealers and auction houses... It's pretty interesting but sometimes quite depressing... as the things that dealers and collectors value the most are investment value, which generally pushes the prices of really good old instruments out of the range of a musician. However, that is the state of the old instrument market... and there is not much that can be done about it... except to look for instruments with relatively little worth (due to the lack of name recognition...) to investors... and to find something that has the qualities that I'm looking for... namely, ease of playing and response... the ideal sound (for my mind!) and something that will serve as a the perfect team partner. Name and investment value are pretty much worthless to me (nice to have... but definitely in a completely different and much lower priority!)\n\nAnyway, over the last half decade, I've not been in too much of a hurry as I've had an instrument on a generous loan... but it also means that it is an instrument that I will never own. So, a mixed blessing... it is on a long term long, but technically it can end at any moment. Not a great situation... but unfortunately for me, the violin that was on loan is a really beautiful sounding and playing instrument from the 1770s... and it and I have made for a decent team so far!\n\nHowever, this instrument (pictured above) was suggested to me a few weeks ago (first by the luthier holding it, and then by the dealer who was selling it.... ). When the messages came, I was in Australia... so, I said that I couldn't drop in until September to see it... which meant that a few people saw it already. Thankfully, none of them took the instrument... and yesterday, I travelled to Amsterdam to pick up the violin (and also to drop off the loan violin to have some minor repairs done... a sort of pit stop). So, we swapped violins so that I would have something to play on during the week whilst the loan violin was on the luthier's surgery table.\n\n... and what can I say... I think I have fallen in love! It is a beautiful English Violin in great condition from around 1775... it is easy to play, and has a beautiful warm and round sound. This could be THE ONE! Now, I'm a pretty picky person when it comes to violins (and violas and viola dámores)... I know other musicians just pick things because they are told that it is good, but I am pretty particular about the way they respond and sound... I've rejected so many instruments in the past... and I've played other people's violins and wondered why they paid for it... however, everyone has their own particular tastes...\n\n![IMG_20190925_091556.jpg](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/bengy/3z9ZvACl-IMG_20190925_091556.jpg)\n\nThe front is a nice cinnamon sound of colour... not as dark as the loan violin that I have, and not quite as light as my \"Classical\" Violin... it has well shaped f-holes and the tailpiece will need to be replaced with an appropriate one for the music that I play. Currently, the string gauges (diameters) are a little thinner than I normally use, but each violin has a sweet spot for that sort of thing... it would be something that I would need to experiment with, but the strings on at the moment are sounding very good!\n\nWhilst I was at the luthier, we tried two different bridges (the bit holding up the string). One was a faster responding and brilliant sounding bridge, whilst the other was darker and slightly slower to respond... it was a quick choice for me... my playing style tends on the fast side of things and this particular bow that I would pair the violin with is also a very fast and agile bow, but I opted for the darker/slower bridge. I much preferred the tempering of my preference and the bow's natural sound... making for a warm round sound instead of a brilliant sound... also, the e string was difficult to control and quite temperamental with the bright fast bridge. So, it was a very easy choice for me!\n\n![IMG_20190925_091609.jpg](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/bengy/oaoz6Vku-IMG_20190925_091609.jpg)\n\nIt has a nicely flamed one piece back... which is in very good condition. Currently, nothing beats the flaming on my French Violin that I use for \"Classical\" music... that one has a varnish and broad flames that shift in the light... it is something quite beautiful to see! There is also the maker's brand on the back near the neck as well...\n\n![IMG_20190925_091627.jpg](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/bengy/r887bckI-IMG_20190925_091627.jpg)\n\nSomething of interest is the mild oxidation (the black dot) in the wood due to the Baroque practice of using iron nails to fix the neck to the body of the instrument. At the time, it was a good idea, strong and easily removeable... however, over the course of a couple of centuries... these things tend to rust! So, in the intervening time... most violins from that age have had the nail removed and replaced with an animal glue instead. So, this is a small scar and reminder of past times!\n\n![IMG_20190925_091638.jpg](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/bengy/65AZzqpR-IMG_20190925_091638.jpg)\n\nAn original scroll... many luthiers and experts will use this part of the instrument to help identify makers and schools of violin making. The way that the scroll (and f-holes) is cut and shaped is quite an individual thing... so, it can be almost a signature of the maker... however, I'm not experienced in that sort of thing... they all look the same to me! I only play the things....\n\n![IMG_20190925_091632.jpg](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/bengy/qrs4mAxO-IMG_20190925_091632.jpg)\n\nNow, an instrument of this age isn't likely to have survived without a few war wounds and a bit of wear and tear. This particular instrument is in pretty stunning condition though... However, you can see some wood worm damage on the front right of the body (the dark spot near the edge).... which has been repaired.\n\n![IMG_20190925_091655.jpg](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/bengy/MJIv3Moy-IMG_20190925_091655.jpg)\n\n.... and also on the lower edge of the lower bout on the bass side of the violin. This isn't very concerning... all the beasties are long dead, and this sort of thing is common enough. The repairs are decent and that is the main thing!\n\n![IMG_20190925_091715.jpg](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/bengy/0jDsU0WH-IMG_20190925_091715.jpg)\n\nSome missing purfling on the lower front (bass side)... again not a big deal, this sort of thing is easy to repair (and will be for the seller to repair... or the luthier (from their commission)). The purfling is partly a decorative ornament around the edges of the violin (they can get quite elaborate), but also serves as functional purpose in channeling potential cracks away form the main soundboard (body) of the instrument.\n\n![IMG_20190925_091726_01.jpg](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/bengy/a36YWU4P-IMG_20190925_091726_01.jpg)\n\nLastly, a minor crack at the f-hole and sound post area of the front. Again, a pretty common thing... these instruments are under 25-50 kilograms of tension pressing down on the front plate. So, over time these things happen... however, again the main thing is that the repairs are well done and reinforced.\n\nSo, there you have it... love at first touch! I had another play in the afternoon yesterday... and then again when I woke up this morning... and yep, it is really a great match for me! I will take it to another luthier this coming week, to double check on the state of the insides and repairs... but it looks like that this might be the end of my search!\n\nNow, it is possible that the dealer might suggest to me that I cut the luthier out of the deal and deal direct with him (we already know each other...). However, I really think that this would be a bit of dick move to save some (...well, more than some...) money. So, I would feel really uncomfortable about that... and then the luthier has been really good to me, and has kept an eye out for instruments for me over this long time... so, I'm not going to even entertain that idea. Honour and respect have a great deal more worth to me....", "timestamp": 1633769349, "digest": "7gDm0s1sbasHGnQsEyvFfQtTnQBJjOdE8t3e97l666A", "contributor": "0xF9f2Abcc9df889794b60f0791A784F5a97d32920"}

{"id": "iaZUoKNuqDypdzpVj3q5yOcxXLgHM_7sfIk9u5kG5x4", "title": "August Report: The increase in the number of NFT projects promote the soaringGAS fees, whoever stands out depends on implementation and innovation", "body": "The content of this report was jointly produced by ULink and BytesIO\n\nLast month witnesses the return and continuation of the bull market. The price of the Bitcoin once again rose to reach $50,000 after a few months, which shows us more possibilities for multiple public chains besides Ethereum.\n\nMeanwhile, supervision is to be tightened. This can be seen from the reactions of various countries. Last month’s cryptocurrency tax bill for the United States has been the focus of everyone’s attention. Under the continuous improvement of the regulations, the U.S. Senator Toomey and Lummis stated that they have reached a bipartisan agreement on the crypto asset tax amendment on August 10. The agreement excludes miners and key wallets from the reporting rules.And the changes have reached an agreement with Warner, Sinema, and Portman.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*6PzqDvfn3Dn-JzDEWuKbFQ.jpeg)\n\nThe Philippine Ministry of Finance, the country where the popular Axie Infinity’s largest user group is in, , stated that income from Axie Infinity and other play-to-earn games is subject to pay income tax. Subsequently, Axie Infinity also tweeted that it looked forward to cooperating with the entity country (government) on the courseof encouraging innovation and empowering players, and called on its digital users to abide by local laws.\n\nOn August 30th, the Central Bank of the Philippines (BSP) is considering classifying Axie Infinity as a payment system operator (OPS), strictly monitoring how players use and exchange SLP tokens/crypto assets in the game, and whether to use it as a kind of payment method and the scope of its merchant network. Once the central bank decides Axie Infinity as OPS, the game’s production company, Vietnam-based Sky Mavis or its local partners must complete OPS registration with the central bank, otherwise it will stop running.\n\nThe attitudes of the above two countries and project parties show that the combination of cryptocurrency and law in the future will become one of the most significant topics in the world. A tracking report on the global central bank digital currency (CBDC) shows that 81 countries (accounting for more than 90% of global GDP) are currently exploring central bank digital currencies.\n\nHow to legislate? How to levy taxes? How to avoid excessive speculation? These three major problems have become problems that all countries in the world have to solve. In the current situation of normalization of the epidemic, the demand for transnational transactions has accelerated the implementation of the blockchain, and has also offeredthe public a better view of online income, laying a solid foundation for the digitalization of the whole people. The bubble can only be eliminated when the technology is realized and currency drives out the bad currency. Now everything depends on the country’s policy.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*GrFgXmTLusDEznJJ-T8kXQ.jpeg)\n\nPoly Network had $ 610 million in crypto assets stolen last month, attracting much attention. Although the hacker eventually returned all the assets, many agreements such as DAO Maker, Punk Protocol, Neko and Ref.Finance and Liquid Exchange are is not as lucky as Poly Network while confronting the security problem. It is rather hard to believe that so many attacks are just to help the project team discover vulnerabilities. These incidents have exposed the security problems of blockchain applications. The sentence “I need to harden the iron” fully reflects the current status of blockchain applications. Since the popularity of DeFi last year, security incidents have emerged one after another. Only infrastructure and security issues have been resolved, the public can use it with confidence.\n\nPoly Network theft incident slow fog replay content:\n\n[https://slowmist.medium.com/the-analysis-and-q-a-of-poly-network-being-hacked-8112a35beb39](https://slowmist.medium.com/the-analysis-and-q-a-of-poly-network-being-hacked-8112a35beb39)\n\nAfter the completion of the EIP-1559 upgrade, the gas fee rose instead of falling. Although it brought deflation and appreciation to ETH, some investors and users were still suffering from high gas and chose other public chains for use. The soaring Ethereum Gas fee last month is, essentially mainly because NFT projects go on and on. The meta-universe, avatar, fragmentation and other forms of display are popping up. Is this a big bubble or can it really land? To empower the application, we need to keep our eyes open and look for high-quality and valuable items in it, because “No matter how good the avatar is, there is no scene but CX”.\n\nNFTs currently need to solve the problem of counterfeiting and copyright ownership. Non-copyrighted NFTs are prone to risk of falling prices or even zeroing. The same is true for some purely imitated NFTs. Although there are many types of NFTs and trading platforms, pricing and the rights and interests of the NFT still need to be explored, whether it is the addition of traditional industries or the original digital assets created on the chain. It just so happened that two cases of copyright problems occurred last month:\n\n(1) Till Lindemann, the lead singer of the German metal band Rammstein, sells NFT tokens, which are video digital art he recently shot at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. However, the museum stated that the sale was unauthorized and did not allow Lindemann to take pictures there.\n\n(2) Matt Furie, creator of the “Pepe the Frog” meme, requested that the frog-themed NFT project worth more than US$4 million be removed from OpenSea because it infringed its copyright. The NFT project is called “Sad Frogs District” and contains 7000 Sad Frog NFTs formed according to the program selection from approximately 200 features.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Z5CsNqerSWCm3teU8PmAkQ.jpeg)\n\nOpenSea transaction volume in August\n\nIn addition to the increasing in the number of of NFT projects in the crypto market last month, there are also several well-developed public chains, such as Avalanche, Polygon, Solana, and Terra.\n\nAvalanche’s TVL rose from US$220 million to US$2.01 billion from August 18th to August 29th, showing a very strong performance.\n\nPolygon also acquired Hermez last month, which is also the first acquisition in the crypto field in the form of a Token merger, providing an innovative form for the industry to move forward.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*UqDlMZ-m6h-CDPV1Q-z2CQ.jpeg)\n\nAverage Gas Consumption Data in August\n\n## DeFi\n\nAs of August 30, according to DeFi Liama data, the total lock-up amount in the DeFi field is about US$152 billion. The TVL of each public chain is as follows:\n\nEthereum: 111.79 billion US dollars\n\nBSC: $17.96 billion\n\nTerra: $7.71 billion\n\nPolygon: US$4.73 billion\n\nSolana: $3.04 billion\n\nAvalanche: $2.19 billion\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*ffqqTVRQ6r3_DP9w0kqN-g.jpeg)\n\nAs can be seen from the above figure, Ethereum still occupies the leading position, greatly surpassing other public chains. Among them, AAVE’s total lock-up amount on the Ethereum and Polygon chains reached 13.7 billion U.S. dollars, becoming the number one project in TVL. .\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Mcy8TgVrX-J-uydM7YqSHw.jpeg)\n\nOn the evening of August 5th, the deflation of EIP-1559 officially started. As of August 30th, 133437.5 ETH had been burned, worth about US$428,633,371.79. On average, 5.75 ETH was burned per minute. The most burned application was OpenSea, with multiple NFTs last month. The explosion of applications has led to a sharp increase in transaction volume, which is the main reason for the burning.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*fRmVde44aQHyAWrOpxiGWA.jpeg)\n\n## Cross-chain agreement\n\nUp to now, many mainstream cross-chain protocols have had problems and frequent security incidents have shown us that many interoperability solutions are not safe to use, or even unusable. Now many “bridges” are temporarily pieced together to meet the immediate needs of the project.\n\nCross-chain protocols are currently facing problems such as high construction costs and high demand. The current temporary solutions cannot meet user needs for a long time due to imperfect architecture or other problems. A safer “bridge” is always an issue that such project parties need to consider. That’s because the entire ecosystem will benefit from safety and good design.\n\nOn June 29th, THORChain, a decentralized cross-chain transaction protocol, tweeted that a malicious attack on THORChain was discovered, and the capital loss caused by the attack was US$140,000.\n\nOn July 2, the XDX Swap on the cross-chain decentralized exchange DDEX was attacked. The attacker made a profit of 85.17 ETH (approximately US$178.5 million), and all the profits have been cross-chained to Ethereum.\n\nIn the early morning of July 11, the cross-chain asset bridge project ChainSwap (ASAP) suffered a hacking attack due to a key vulnerability in its smart contract, and lost approximately US$8 million.\n\nAt 1 am on July 12, the Anyswap decentralized cross-chain transaction protocol officially tweeted that Anyswap multi-link was attacked by the v3 version. The loss was about 2.4 million USDC and 5.51 million MIM, totaling about 8 million U.S. dollars.\n\nOn August 10, the cross-chain aggregation protocol O3 Swap (O3) cross-chain pools saw a large transfer of assets, and Binance Smart Chain and Polygon’s total assets of USD 335 million were transferred to two addresses.\n\nOn the same day, the cross-chain interoperability protocol Poly Network was also attacked, with a total of over US$610 million transferred to 3 addresses.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/1\\*lPErBshC-q3Ryq9V5K-EoQ.jpeg)\n\n## NFT transactions highlights\n\nOn the evening of July 31, the NFT sale of Animetas triggered a surge in Ethereum gas fees within a short period of time, which exceeded 1,250 GWei at one time.\n\nOn August 3, Uniswap founder Hayden Adams paid 78.99 ETH (approximately US$202,000) to purchase CryptoPunk 6055 NFT.\n\nOn August 3, the NFT collection “Coca-Cola Friendship Box” co-launched by Coca-Cola and the 3D virtual avatar application platform Tafi was auctioned on the OpenSea platform. The auction price was 217.4541 ETH (approximately US$540,000). Donated to Special Olympics.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*RuWqeXNdMPFDXzcdsrBE4w.jpeg)\n\nNFT transaction data in August\n\nOn August 13, Fortune magazine conducted its first NFT sale, part of which was a set of the latest cover art limited edition NFT designed by digital artist pppleasr, with a total sales volume of 429 ETH, approximately US$1.3878 million.\n\n0n1Force opened the pre-sale at 0:00 on August 20, and it was sold out in only 5 minutes, causing the Ethereum GAS fee to briefly soar above 2400Gwei. The total number of 0n1 Forces is 7777. Each person can cast up to 2 0n1 Forces, and the casting cost is about 0.07777ETH.\n\nOn August 23, Visa purchased the CryptoPunk NFT numbered 7610 for approximately US$150,000. After that, there were dozens of transactions in CryptoPunks, and the transaction amount basically ranged from 60–200 ETH, most of which were 60–100 ETH.\n\nOn August 25, Budweiser purchased the Tom Sachs Rocket Factory NFT works for 8 ETH. In addition, Budweiser purchased the ENS domain name Beer.eth for 30 ETH (US$100,000). Budweiser has reached a long-term partnership with NFT media store VaynerNFT. Budweiser is seeking to use NFT to convert tickets and products into NFT. Budweiser will also create a new intellectual property-driven NFT experience for its fans, thereby providing an experience based on sports, entertainment and music.\n\nOn August 28, the NFT project of Adam Bomb Squad released by the clothing brand The Millions early in the morning caused more than 1,900 ETH to be burned within 24 hours, and caused the Ethereum Gas to skyrocket to more than 1,500 GWei.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*RuWqeXNdMPFDXzcdsrBE4w.jpeg)\n\nOpenSea transaction data\n\n## Big event\n\nOn August 4, the NFT-based game application “Louis: TheGame” was launched to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of founder Louis Vuitton.

The two projects also merged their native tokens-MATIC and HEZ-which was the first such transaction in the crypto space. On August 29, Hermez officially changed its name to Polygon Hermez. MATIC will become the utility token of Polygon Hermez. Polygon has allocated 250 million MATIC tokens to develop Polygon Hermez, 90 million of which are allocated to investors and the remaining 160 million. Assigned to the initial team supporters and developers. The team stated that the HEZ and MATIC token merger smart contract has been deployed to the testnet, and the mainnet time has not yet been determined.\n\nOn August 14, the US magazine Time and the NFT project Cool Cats jointly released a limited edition NFT series.\n\nOn August 15th, the 20th anniversary vinyl NFT “Monk” was officially released on QQ Music.

The report described the platform’s exploration and achievements in the NFT field in a larger length, and revealed that the platform may launch its own NFT digital art Trading platform.\n\nOn August 27th, the Ethereum Domain Name System (ENS) announced the complete integration of the DNS Namespace on Ethereum, allowing any .com domain name to be associated with an Ethereum address. For example, if you have example.com on DNS, you can import it into ENS and continue to use example.com instead of example.eth. In addition, users are also allowed to set ENS records to receive ETH, BTC, and DOGE on the example.com domain name Wait for cryptocurrency. The Ethereum Domain Name System stated that the development of this feature was funded by the Ethereum Foundation and ETC Labs.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*OS0bz0Cg2Q8o42M5msoV7A.jpeg)\n\nOn August 29, the listed company Ninth City announced that it would launch the NFT platform NFTSTAR, which is expected to be officially launched in the fourth quarter of this year.

This agreement will benefit the Rarible ecosystem and promote innovation.\n\n· The core of Rarible Protocol is a decentralized exchange. Applications built on the Rarible Protocol can share order book liquidity.\n\n·One of the most powerful features of the protocol is its ability to share costs during the transaction, which makes it possible to jointly create NFTs.\n\n·Rarible Protocol implements royalty standards for NFTs minted by the protocol and NFTs minted externally. No matter which platform the transaction is conducted, the creator and the platform’s royalties will be complied with.\n\n·Rarible Protocol is currently deployed on Ethereum and will soon be available on Flow and Polygon.\n\n· There are currently 20 different projects building applications on this agreement, including Rarible.com.\n\n·Rarible DAO mainly supports projects based on the agreement in two ways: a total of approximately US$40,000 in RARI tokens are allocated each week, and the RARI obtained by each application is proportional to the sales volume of the week; and developers based on the agreement provide up to A grant of US$100,000.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*aKY_vV06x8v9t_REVrndhA.jpeg)\n\n**Alethea AI**\n\nAlethea AI is an intelligent NFT infrastructure service provider that aims to create a scalable and interactive intelligent NFT (iNFT) AI infrastructure, and plans to build a meta-universe composed of robots. Alethea AI, as a decentralized synthesis medium, allows creators, developers, and fan communities to use their own virtual economy to create intelligent and interactive AI avatars. Previously, the first iNFT work “GPT-3 NFT” launched by Alethea AI and Robert Alice was successfully auctioned at Sotheby’s auction house for US$478,000.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*apUEkzfkxe2NnD8fX2Tr6w.jpeg)\n\n## major projects\n\n**Dydx**\n\nDydx is the world’s first decentralized digital currency derivatives trading platform. Well-known investors such as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Abstract Ventures CEO Scott Belsky also participated in the investment. dYdX aims to establish more open, transparent and safe financial products through decentralized technology, and will develop regulatory-compliant methods on its platform. On August 26, the cumulative trading volume of the decentralized derivatives trading platform dYdX exceeded US$10 billion.\n\nOn August 3, Dydx launched the dYdX Layer2 protocol governance token DYDX. The total amount of DYDX tokens is 1 billion, which will be distributed to all dYdX ecological participants within five years, including community users, investors and the dYdX team. Among them, 50% (500 million pieces) will be allocated to the community. Specifically, 25% will be allocated to transaction mining users, 7.5% to retrospective mining users, 7.5% to market makers, and to market makers. 5% of the reserve fund is allocated to 2.5% of users participating in the liquid staking pool, 2.5% to users participating in the DYDX staking user (insurance pool), 27.73% to past investors, and 15.27 to dYdX Trading or dYdX Foundation members %, 7.00% allocated to future members of dYdX Trading or dYdX Foundation.

Their smart contract platform allows artists to publish limited edition digital art collections tracked on the blockchain, which are rare, verifiable and worth collecting. Its mission is to help artists make a living on the Internet, while contributing more works of art to the world. We believe that artists should be able to make a living in the way they love. We believe that the ability to ensure a certain percentage of secondary market revenue for artists is one of the most revolutionary and exciting capabilities provided by Ethereum smart contracts. This is similar to a musician who obtained a percentage of the sales of vinyl records released in the 1960s and is still sold in second-hand record stores today.\n\nOn August 18, the encrypted art platform SuperRare announced the launch of version 2.0 and issued the governance token RARE. The total amount of RARE tokens is 1 billion, of which 15% will be airdropped to users who sell or buy art on the platform before July 21. If the tokens are not claimed within 90 days, the tokens will be returned to the community vault . In addition, version 2.0 also includes the independent exhibition space SuperRare Spaces, the project autonomous organization SuperRare DAO, and the “sovereign smart contract” that can be used by independent artists on SuperRare to create custom NFTs or brand tokens.\n\n**Cryptovoxels**\n\nCryptovoxels is also a project that has attracted much attention in the meta-universe field. It is a virtual world built on Ethereum, a 3D blockchain sandbox game composed of plots and Minecraft-like voxels. Simply put, it is a completely open free sandbox game. Players do not have any objective tasks and can do whatever they want in the game. You can explore freely on the big map, extending from west to east to dozens of kilometers.\n\nOn August 25th, the meta-universe platform Cryptovoxels announced that it will launch BOOP tokens, and will issue BOOP token airdrop rewards 1:1 according to the number of visitors to the player’s parcel.\n\n## Financing news\n\nKrystal, a one-stop DeFi portal incubated by Kyber, completed $6.6 million in financing, with Hashed leading the investment.\n\nNFT trading platform MakersPlace completed $30 million in financing, led by Bessemer and Pantera.\n\nNFT creation and issuance platform Cent completed a seed round financing of 3 million US dollars, and Galaxy Interactive participated in the investment.\n\nAspen Digital, a one-stop digital asset management platform, completed US$8.8 million in financing, led by British investment trusts RIT Capital Partners and Liberty City Ventures.\n\nOnramp Invest, a technology platform serving investment advisors, completed a US$6 million financing, and Coinbase and WisdomTree participated in the investment.\n\nBlockchain data provider Messari completed a US$21 million Series A financing, led by Point72 Ventures.\n\nOn-chain data and market analysis platform CryptoQuant completed a $3 million financing, with Hashed leading the investment.\n\nReddit announced that it has received US$410 million in Series F financing.

The new rum series will be on the shelves in September, and the NFT works will be unveiled and auctioned on September 1. The auction will last for two weeks.\n\nSalvador’s official Bitcoin wallet Chivo Wallet will be launched on September 7. The government will not force residents of the country to accept Bitcoin as a payment method. Salvadoran citizens download Chivo Wallet in the app store and will receive 30 USD worth of Bitcoin.

The explosion of multiple NFT projects last month has allowed people to see its value and is gradually changing people’s cognition of NFT — It is not only a work of art, but it also makes difference with its social and practical attributes.\n\nI think fragmentation is a way of CX. NFT itself is a non-homogeneous form. It can be combined with more entities as equity, but splitting into a token will only accelerate the bubble period of NFT. Turning a non-financial product into a financial product is not necessarily the best way to use the current status quo. YFI founder Andre Cronje and some major industry players have warned about this.\n\nSecurity issues are always the top priority. It can be seen from the many security incidents that occurred last month that for the project, the project security has not been done well, and no matter how much TVL, it will only fall short, and the final loss is mainly those who bear the loss. Investors who continue to believe in project development.\n\nThe development speed of the meta universe has exceeded our imagination. The movie “Out of Control Player” released last month depicts some scenarios that may happen in the future, allowing the public to be on the scene.\n\nThe industry is constantly developing, and the speed of breakthrough innovation has far exceeded our imagination. Who can break through depends on landing and innovation. Blindly imitating hot spots can only become a short-lived phenomenon. Only be those pioneers and forge ahead stay in the wave.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*xxg45JqScRcZzjwHxVIjdA.jpeg)\n\n\\*\\*Twitter: \\*\\***<https://twitter.com/ULink88>**\n\n\\*\\*Telegram: \\*\\***<https://t.me/ulink88>**", "timestamp": 1633769342, "digest": "eZN2_Z8Bv68_1AXidtXL_NUFQBvZZwD0vIdKut7fmLI", "contributor": "0xCE561d5fA83Bcf498B30ecDd7c7F8bA11241271E"}
{"id": "LJ4KywWc0fd155JoX36hfBdRul2_actH2pUKeJuANL8", "title": "解读：央行等十部门通知后 个人投资加密货币是非法行为吗？", "body": "十部门发布的《关于进一步防范和处置虚拟货币交易炒作风险的通知》（以下简称“通知”），其中的重磅条款，就是明确虚拟货币相关业务活动的本质属性是非法金融活动。\n\n在其非法金融活动的性质之下，法人、非法人组织和自然人凡是从事与虚拟货币相关的业务活动都会被扣上“违法”的帽子，并被严令禁止。这也是业界所称“封杀”虚拟货币的由来。\n\n在大背景之下，很多人就会有疑问，既然与虚拟货币相关的业务活动将被禁止，那么虚拟货币能否作为理财产品，供个人去投资?个人投资虚拟币是否违法？如果个人投资遭受损失，能不能要回？\n\n目前，有很多对该《通知》进行解读的文章，但是大多数都是强调虚拟货币强监管的属性，强调虚拟货币的非法性，告知公众虚拟货币交易是违法甚至犯罪行为。但是在强监管的态度下，个人就真不能投资虚拟货币了吗？个人投资就违法吗？\n\n1 防止虚拟货币交易炒作与“禁止投资虚拟币”\n\n个人能否投资虚拟货币，取决于国家出台《通知》的目的。《通知》标题指明了整个《通知》的出台是为了防范和处置虚拟货币交易炒作风险，其重点是“炒作风险”。\n\n《通知》开头也进一步阐明，“近期，虚拟货币交易炒作活动抬头，扰乱经济金融秩序，滋生赌博、非法集资、诈骗、传销、洗钱等违法犯罪活动，严重危害人民群众财产安全。”\n\n经过仔细分析，就可以得知，虚拟货币要防范的是交易炒作，防范虚拟货币被用作于违法犯罪活动的工具。\n\n因此，凡是与虚拟货币发行、交易、兑换、以及各种辅助性的信息中介和定价服务，为境外虚拟货币交易所提供营销宣传、支付结算、技术支持等服务都被纳入禁止范围，原因就是这些服务或者业务活动不可避免的会成为赌博、非法集资、诈骗、传销、洗钱等违法犯罪活动的“温床”，进而扰乱经济金融秩序。\n\n由此可知，上述与虚拟货币相关的业务活动，必然会引起虚拟货币的“炒作风险”。\n\n故，只要不会引起“炒作风险”，以及没有利用虚拟货币进行赌博、非法集资、诈骗、传销、洗钱等违法犯罪活动的行为，就不会成为《通知》所要防范的对象。\n\n2 虚拟货币相关业务活动是非法金融活动与“个人投资违法”\n\n很多人认为既然虚拟货币相关业务活动都是非法金融活动了，那么个人投资，包括个人参与现货交易、杠杆交易、合约交易，也就属于非法金融活动了。这是一种错误认识。\n\n前文已说到，《通知》为了防范和处置虚拟货币交易炒作风险，防止虚拟货币成为赌博、非法集资、诈骗、传销、洗钱等违法犯罪活动的工具，禁止的是从事与虚拟货币相关的业务活动。通俗的讲，就是禁止任何人面向公众提供与虚拟货币相关的任何服务。\n\n《通知》其实是明确现有面向公众提供虚拟货币相关服务的主体，是非法金融活动，自己要及时停止一切活动，同时，也告知任何主体不得开展面向公众提供任何与虚拟货币相关的服务。\n\n正如广东广强律师事务所曾杰律师所说，“通知第二条所针对的主体和行为模式是个人或机构以营利为目的的专业工作或商业行为，而非偶发性的交易活动或者业余性、非计划性、低频次的个人投资者。”\n\n事实上，《通知》第（十六）条，也说明了围绕虚拟货币相关业务活动的违法性，而非个人投资的违法性。\n\n“加强政策解读和宣传教育。各部门、各地区及行业协会要充分运用各类媒体等传播渠道，通过法律政策解读、典型案例剖析、投资风险教育等方式，向社会公众宣传虚拟货币炒作等相关业务活动的违法性、危害性及其表现形式等，增强社会公众风险防范意识。”\n\n3 参与虚拟币交易存在法律风险与“禁止投资虚拟货币”\n\n《通知》之（四）规定了，“参与虚拟货币投资交易活动存在法律风险。任何法人、非法人组织和自然人投资虚拟货币及相关衍生品，违背公序良俗的，相关民事法律行为无效，由此引发的损失由其自行承担；涉嫌破坏金融秩序、危害金融安全的，由相关部门依法查处。”\n\n很多人据此认为，个人投资虚拟货币将不被允许，实际上，这是对投资虚拟货币的误解。该规定只是履行告知义务，旨在提醒民众，参与虚拟货币交易所产生的纠纷，在法律上不被认可。\n\n比如，个人参与的某些主体提供的虚拟货币质押、矿机租赁挖币、衍生品交易，如果发生损失，或者对方是进行违法犯罪活动，那么个人与对方之间的民事法律关系，可能会因为违背公序良俗，导致双方之间的投资理财行为在法律上不受保护，最终个人自行承担所遭受的损失，无法采用法律手段将其追回。\n\n事实上，《通知》之四与九四公告的精神仍然保持一致，即个人参与虚拟货币交易，由此导致的风险自担。但与九四公告不同的是，个人参与的虚拟币交易的类型被法律不予认可的范围已经扩大到衍生品交易，因此，个人在投资虚拟货币时，应当加强自身的风控义务。\n\n4 其他\n\n同时《通知》虽然规定，境外虚拟货币交易所通过互联网向我国境内居民提供服务同样属于非法金融活动。但这一规定是针对于开设交易所，提供虚拟币服务的主体，并不针对于个人投资。\n\n实际上，目前我国对虚拟货币的态度，与外汇保证金交易和外盘期货交易的态度一致，即国内不允许相关主体组织进行外汇按金交易和外盘期货交易活动，也不允许国内相关主体为境外主体提供相应的服务，但是个人参与到境外主体组织的交易活动并不禁止。\n\n综上，十部门发布的《关于进一步防范和处置虚拟货币交易炒作风险的通知》，虽然对币圈而言是沉重一击，但并不意味着个人投资虚拟币，参与虚拟币交易就被禁止。\n\n《通知》的主旨是在于通过明确虚拟货币相关义务活动属于非法金融活动，通过禁止相关主体从事虚拟货币相关业务活动，防范虚拟货币炒作，和防止虚拟货币被用作违法犯罪活动的工具。", "timestamp": 1633769489, "digest": "WXBGan5XGXhmqFfkhtLfHUrLXA7stXZMjvAS-AAsxM4", "contributor": "0x7aCaae8C0f6f0b9b1fBe4080299aaA754c56B4d7"}

{"id": "trhKgS4KR2iq8OxTldMmUovBa-842pklx_rW8YMX6M8", "title": "Venture DAOs", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HNeSWZP7YyalvsSf-l46u.png?height=602&width=602)\n\nPeople can coordinate funds, labour, time, and social capital through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which is a crypto native and remote-first method. DAOs have distributed governance, with all funds and assets controlled on-chain via smart contracts. There is no board of directors, and the organization has no central control. They manage the soft human-facing layer of crypto, which includes money, social capital, reputation, and attention. They are essentially political tools that offer individuals power based on popular consensus.\n\nLet's look into Venture DAOs, which are groups of people or entities that pool their money and administer it. Everyone participates to sourcing, appraisal, and a rough consensus before execution since they have skin in the game.\n\n[MetaCartel Ventures (MCV) ](https://metacartel.xyz/)is a for-profit DAO established by the MetaCartel community with the goal of investing in early-stage Decentralized Applications (DApps). It has a community-oriented membership structure and provides radical engagement and flexibility that typical \"venture capital fund\" models cannot match. The members of the DAO will be the DAO's designated investors, sourcing, completing due diligence, proposing, and voting on investments. New member admission is permissioned and curated by members, whereas leaving the DAO is fully permissionless, allowing exiting members to receive their full pro rata portion of the DAO's assets at any moment. The founding members of MCV will be trustworthy Ethereum community creators, builders, investors, and MetaCartel community participants. The DAO's business entity is strongly tied with its smart contracts and token technology distributed on the Ethereum mainnet, and MCV is made up of a code and law coupling. The technological half of MCV will be a Moloch v2 smart contract instance, while the legal half will be a member-managed Delaware limited liability business controlled principally by the Grimoire (the \"Limited Liability Company Agreement\") and Delaware Limited Liability Company Act provisions. The Zerolaw Augmentation Paper explains the overall theory behind this marriage of blockchain technology with law to augment organisations.\n\n[The LAO](https://www.thelao.io/) was founded in the same spirit as The DAO, as a member-directed venture capital fund based in the United States, with the goal of adhering to US law. The LAO, like The DAO, allows its members to pool cash, engage in initiatives, and share in the profits. The LAO is a legal corporation (a Delaware limited liability company) that is mostly managed through an internet application (a \"DApp\") using smart contracts. The LAO has funded over 30 projects across the Ethereum and blockchain ecosystem since its launch in late April 2020. Funding will be supplied to projects in the form of the cryptocurrency Ether under the criteria described in these FAQs unless the members change their minds. The LAO will be member-managed at its heart, relying on a DApp and related smart contracts to support investments in digital asset initiatives. Unlike The DAO, which was arguably an implicit partnership with little legal protection for members, The LAO's operating agreement clearly limits members' responsibility and any fiduciary obligations among members, to the degree authorised by applicable law in each situation. The LAO will rely on a service provider (initially, OpenLaw) to handle a variety of administrative functions on behalf of its members, such as preparing and sending annual K-1 tax forms, updating and maintaining the DApp, validating information related to projects chosen for investment, and handling other interactions that may arise during the LAO's lifetime (e.g., receiving the proceeds from the sale of securities in fiat and converting them to a digital asset for distribution to members). The service provider will be compensated for these services.\n\n[Stacker Ventures](https://bit.ly/stackervc) is a community-run blockchain technology for launching and managing pooled capital. Stacker Ventures is a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) that creates decentralised funds, accelerates venture fund portfolio investments through an engaged community, and provides fund administration with checks and balances. The DAO's first venture fund is a fast-track crypto-native fund that invests in promising startups. In addition to the venture fund, the DAO manages a series of Active Yield Funds that employ DeFi exposure to generate competitive, investment-grade APY. Stacker Ventures is a global community of investors, builders, and early adopters who have come together to fund and support emerging blockchain technologies. We are in the vanguard of a new era in governance as well as open access to early-stage investment opportunities. For early-stage investing, Stacker Ventures provides a flexible and decentralised architecture. Unlike other venture DAOs like Metacartel Ventures and The LAO, Stacker Ventures is an open protocol, an corporation without legal status as a corporation. Operating without a legal structure might pave the way for more decentralized collaborations among DAO members.\n\nAround the world, there is a lot of debate over the legal status and framework of DAOs. It reminds me of the classic debates concerning the legal foundation of corporations as legal personalities. However, companies can be regulated and thus enforced by law, whereas a truly decentralised organisation might not be. Certain platforms (or maybe certain network effects) can opt to subject the network effect to a certain law or jurisdiction, and hence subject DAOs supported by that network effect to that law or jurisdiction to some extent.", "timestamp": 1633769653, "digest": "3IckfmyS-0oTq78I1UXdisYjQrqKo3Ow53NO2RhCs6E", "contributor": "0x38430336153468dcf36Af5cea7D6bc472425633A"}

{"id": "7biFlQmkjgoPBCfOLNWqoaVH9qPbjFuwLQP5IYQPAY4", "title": "🌳🚀 CS Visualized: Useful Git Commands", "body": "Although Git is a very powerful tool, I think most people would agree when I say it can also be... a total nightmare 😐 I've always found it very useful to visualize in my head what's happening when working with Git: how are the branches interacting when I perform a certain command, and how will it affect the history? Why did my coworker cry when I did a hard reset on `master`, `force push`ed to origin and `rimraf`'d the `.git` folder?\n\nI thought it would be the perfect use case to create some visualized examples of the most common and useful commands! 🥳 Many of the commands I'm covering have optional arguments that you can use in order to change their behavior. In my examples, I'll cover the default behavior of the commands without adding (too many) config options! 😄\n\n***\n\n## [](#merging)[]()Merging\n\nHaving multiple branches is extremely convenient to keep new changes separated from each other, and to make sure you don't accidentally push unapproved or broken changes to production. Once the changes have been approved, we want to get these changes in our production branch!\n\nOne way to get the changes from one branch to another is by performing a `git merge`! There are two types of merges Git can perform: a **fast-forward**, or a **no-fast-forward** 🐢\n\nThis may not make a lot of sense right now, so let's look at the differences!\n\n### [](#fastforward-raw-ff-endraw-)Fast-forward (`--ff`)\n\nA **fast-forward merge** can happen when the current branch has no extra commits compared to the branch we’re merging. Git is... *lazy* and will first try to perform the easiest option: the fast-forward! This type of merge doesn’t create a new commit, but rather merges the commit(s) on the branch we’re merging right in the current branch 🥳\n\n[![](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cT4TSe48--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/894znjv4oo9agqiz4dql.gif)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cT4TSe48--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/894znjv4oo9agqiz4dql.gif)\n\nPerfect! We now have all the changes that were made on the `dev` branch available on the `master` branch. So, what's the **no-fast-forward** all about?\n\n### [](#nofastfoward-raw-noff-endraw-)No-fast-foward (`--no-ff`)\n\nIt's great if your current branch doesn't have any extra commits compared to the branch that you want to merge, but unfortunately that's rarely the case! If we committed changes on the current branch that the branch we want to merge doesn't have, git will perform a *no-fast-forward* merge.\n\nWith a no-fast-forward merge, Git creates a new *merging commit* on the active branch. The commit's parent commits point to both the active branch and the branch that we want to merge!\n\n[![](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zRZ0x2Vc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/rf1o2b6eduboqwkigg3w.gif)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zRZ0x2Vc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/rf1o2b6eduboqwkigg3w.gif)\n\nNo big deal, a perfect merge! 🎉 The `master` branch now contains all the changes that we've made on the `dev` branch.\n\n### [](#merge-conflicts)Merge Conflicts\n\nAlthough Git is good at deciding how to merge branches and add changes to files, it cannot always make this decision all by itself 🙂 This can happen when the two branches we're trying to merge have changes on the same line in the same file, or if one branch deleted a file that another branch modified, and so on.\n\nIn that case, Git will ask you to help decide which of the two options we want to keep! Let's say that on both branches, we edited the first line in the `README.md`.\n\n[![](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jXqGWUai--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/m3nxmp67mqof5sa3iik9.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jXqGWUai--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/m3nxmp67mqof5sa3iik9.png)\n\nIf we want to merge `dev` into `master`, this will end up in a merge conflict: would you like the title to be `Hello!` or `Hey!`?\n\nWhen trying to merge the branches, Git will show you where the conflict happens. We can manually remove the changes we don't want to keep, save the changes, add the changed file again, and commit the changes 🥳\n\n[![](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7lBksXwA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/bcd5ajtoc0g5dxzmpfbq.gif)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7lBksXwA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/bcd5ajtoc0g5dxzmpfbq.gif)\n\nYay! Although merge conflicts are often quite annoying, it makes total sense: Git shouldn't just *assume* which change we want to keep.\n\n***\n\n## [](#rebasing)[]()Rebasing\n\nWe just saw how we could apply changes from one branch to another by performing a `git merge`. Another way of adding changes from one branch to another is by performing a `git rebase`.\n\nA `git rebase` *copies* the commits from the current branch, and puts these copied commits on top of the specified branch.\n\n[![](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EIY4OOcE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/dwyukhq8yj2xliq4i50e.gif)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EIY4OOcE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/dwyukhq8yj2xliq4i50e.gif)\n\nPerfect, we now have all the changes that were made on the `master` branch available on the `dev` branch! 🎊\n\nA big difference compared to merging, is that Git won't try to find out which files to keep and not keep. The branch that we're rebasing always has the latest changes that we want to keep! You won't run into any merging conflicts this way, and keeps a nice linear Git history.\n\nThis example shows rebasing on the `master` branch. In bigger projects, however, you usually don't want to do that. A `git rebase` **changes the history of the project** as new hashes are created for the copied commits!\n\nRebasing is great whenever you're working on a feature branch, and the master branch has been updated. You can get all the updates on your branch, which would prevent future merging conflicts! 😄\n\n### [](#interactive-rebase)Interactive Rebase\n\nBefore rebasing the commits, we can modify them! 😃 We can do so with an *interactive rebase*. An interactive rebase can also be useful on the branch you're currently working on, and want to modify some commits.\n\nThere are 6 actions we can perform on the commits we're rebasing:\n\n*   `reword`: Change the commit message\n*   `edit`: Amend this commit\n*   `squash`: Meld commit into the previous commit\n*   `fixup`: Meld commit into the previous commit, without keeping the commit's log message\n*   `exec`: Run a command on each commit we want to rebase\n*   `drop`: Remove the commit\n\nAwesome! This way, we can have full control over our commits. If we want to remove a commit, we can just `drop` it.\n\n[![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P6jr7igd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/msofpv7k6rcmpaaefscm.gif)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P6jr7igd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/msofpv7k6rcmpaaefscm.gif)\n\nOr if we want to squash multiple commits together to get a cleaner history, no problem!\n\n[![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VSQt4g1V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/bc1r460xx1i0blu0lnnm.gif)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VSQt4g1V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/bc1r460xx1i0blu0lnnm.gif)\n\nInteractive rebasing gives you a lot of control over the commits you're trying to rebase, even on the current active branch!\n\n***\n\n## [](#resetting)[]()Resetting\n\nIt can happen that we committed changes that we didn't want later on. Maybe it's a `WIP` commit, or maybe a commit that introduced bugs! 🐛 In that case, we can perform a `git reset`.\n\nA `git reset` gets rid of all the current staged files and gives us control over where `HEAD` should point to.\n\n### [](#soft-reset)Soft reset\n\nA *soft reset* moves `HEAD` to the specified commit (or the index of the commit compared to `HEAD`), without getting rid of the changes that were introduced on the commits afterward!\n\nLet's say that we don't want to keep the commit `9e78i` which added a `style.css` file, and we also don't want to keep the commit `035cc` which added an `index.js` file. However, we do want to keep the newly added `style.css` and `index.js` file! A perfect use case for a soft reset.\n\n[![](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---GveiZe---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/je5240aqa5uw9d8j3ibb.gif)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---GveiZe---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/je5240aqa5uw9d8j3ibb.gif)\n\nWhen typing `git status`, you'll see that we still have access to all the changes that were made on the previous commits. This is great, as this means that we can fix the contents of these files and commit them again later on!\n\n### [](#hard-reset)Hard reset\n\nSometimes, we don't want to keep the changes that were introduced by certain commits. Unlike a soft reset, we shouldn't need to have access to them any more. Git should simply reset its state back to where it was on the specified commit: this even includes the changes in your working directory and staged files! 💣\n\n[![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GqjwnYkF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/hlh0kowt3hov1xhcku38.gif)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GqjwnYkF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/hlh0kowt3hov1xhcku38.gif)\n\nGit has discarded the changes that were introduced on `9e78i` and `035cc`, and reset its state to where it was on commit `ec5be`.\n\n***\n\n### [](#reverting)[]()Reverting\n\nAnother way of undoing changes is by performing a `git revert`. By reverting a certain commit, we create a *new commit* that contains the reverted changes!\n\nLet's say that `ec5be` added an `index.js` file. Later on, we actually realize we didn't want this change introduced by this commit anymore! Let's revert the `ec5be` commit.\n\n[![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eckmvr2M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3kkd2ahn41zixs12xgpf.gif)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eckmvr2M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3kkd2ahn41zixs12xgpf.gif)\n\nPerfect! Commit `9e78i` reverted the changes that were introduced by the `ec5be` commit. Performing a `git revert` is very useful in order to undo a certain commit, without modifying the history of the branch.\n\n***\n\n## [](#cherrypicking)[]()Cherry-picking\n\nWhen a certain branch contains a commit that introduced changes we need on our active branch, we can `cherry-pick` that command! By `cherry-pick`ing a commit, we create a new commit on our active branch that contains the changes that were introduced by the `cherry-pick`ed commit.\n\nSay that commit `76d12` on the `dev` branch added a change to the `index.js` file that we want in our `master` branch. We don't want the *entire* we just care about this one single commit!\n\n[![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9vWP_K4S--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/2dkjx4yeaal10xyvj29v.gif)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9vWP_K4S--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/2dkjx4yeaal10xyvj29v.gif)\n\nCool, the master branch now contains the changes that `76d12` introduced!\n\n***\n\n## [](#fetching)[]()Fetching\n\nIf we have a remote Git branch, for example a branch on Github, it can happen that the remote branch has commits that the current branch doesn't have! Maybe another branch got merged, your colleague pushed a quick fix, and so on.\n\nWe can get these changes locally, by performing a `git fetch` on the remote branch! It doesn't affect your local branch in any way: a `fetch` simply downloads new data.\n\n[![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--38PuARw2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/bulx1voegfji4vwgndh4.gif)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--38PuARw2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq\\_66%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/bulx1voegfji4vwgndh4.gif)\n\nWe can now see all the changes that have been made since we last pushed! We can decide what we want to do with the new data now that we have it locally.\n\n***\n\n## [](#pulling)[]()Pulling\n\nAlthough a `git fetch` is very useful in order to get the remote information of a branch, we can also perform a `git pull`. A `git pull` is actually two commands in one: a `git fetch`, and a `git merge`.

La marcha, buena o mala, de estas firmas se mide en euros, las firmas tienen tanto más éxito cuanto más dinero ingresan. Miro y remiro la gráfica con detenimiento tratando de dar con alguna magnitud no cuantificada en euros y no encuentro nada más que el criterio del beneficio económico para medir el éxito o el fracaso. No son muchas las firmas que aparecen en esos periódicos, usualmente cuatro o cinco, lo cual, en un país con 150.000 abogados, da una imagen bastante poco cercana a la realidad de lo que es, de verdad, la abogacía en España.\n\nTratan de convencernos de que el ejercicio de la abogacía es un negocio y que, como tal negocio ha de ser tratado, imponiendo el criterio mercantil del reparto de dividendos como el único valido para regir la empresa.\n\nEsta visión de la abogacía como negocio es compartido por muchas y muy poderosas entidades. La Comisión Nacional del Mercado de la Competencia, cada poco tiempo, deja oír su voz inquisidora en defensa del mercado como si el mercado fuera el supremo interés del género humano, muy por encima de cualquier derecho fundamental proclamado en las constituciones. La nueva ortodoxia religiosa fija el mercado libre como el nuevo paraíso terrenal ya él se dirigen sus fieles sin que un derecho fundamental de más o de menos vaya a dificultar su marcha.\n\nYo creo que si eres jurista sabes perfectamente que la abogacía no es un negocio, o al menos no es exclusivamente un negocio, porque antes y por encima del beneficio económico se sitúan otros fines y consideraciones que —aunque el mercado no las entienda— un jurista las percibe de inmediato. Preséntenme a un abogado cuya primera prioridad sea ganar dinero y les señalaré a un psicópata con un brillante futuro delictivo. Luego le pillarán o no; de momento, alguna de esas cuatro o cinco firmas habituales de los papeles salmón, han confirmado ya esta predicción que les hago.\n\nLo diré una vez más: los abogados a los que admiro no miden su éxito en dinero.\n\nQuizá nadie como Dionisio Moreno ilustre esto que les digo. Él fue el letrado del Caso Aziz, ese que incluyó que todo el abuso hipotecario español fue dinamitado por la jurisprudencia europea. Dionisio, sin duda, con su trabajo, ha sido el hombre que mayor cantidad de felicidad ha regalado a los españoles en los últimos tiempos: hoy centenares de miles de familias españolas no han perdido sus hogares porque Dionisio hizo lo que hizo, hoy centenares de miles de familias españolas litigan para recuperar parte de las cantidades ingentes de dinero que, esos supremos sacerdotes del dividendo que son los bancos, les sacaron del bolsillo.\n\nHoy Dionisio debería ser famoso y hartarse de conferencias, pero resultó que en la época en que defendía a Aziz alguien trató de hacer la puñeta. Yo no diría que ninguno de los bufetes de la prensa salmón haya tenido un éxito comparable al suyo.\n\nEste tipo de letrados como Dionisio son el 80% de los que ejercen la abogacía en España. Son los letrados de la gente común, los que no trabajan para el alto staff de bancos, aseguradoras, multinacionales o grandes corporaciones. Son quienes no deben nada a los grandes y por eso son la esperanza de los pequeños, son los abogados que molestan a quienes prefieren una abogacía menos luchadora, a los que quieren «desjudicializar» los asuntos para impedir que nadie pueda conocer sus fechorías.\n\nEsta abogacía independiente y al servicio de la población, esta que no divide a los abogados en «seniors» o «juniors», esta que no sale en las hojas sepia de la prensa económica, es mi abogacía; a la que pertenezco, a la que amo, la imprescindible si de verdad queremos poder vivir en libertad y con justicia.\n\nHoy esa abogacía está sufriendo el mayor ataque de su historia: casi un 25% de sus miembros no pueden pagar la Mutualidad, se han reducido sus parcelas de actuación y una legislación dolosa trata de favorecer los entornos sociales y económicos donde ejercer este tipo de abogacía sea ​​cada vez más difícil.\n\nEstamos en el punto de no retorno y no alcanzando parece que las instituciones corporativas (Colegios, CGAE) sean capaces de invertir este rápido descenso a los infiernos. Hay que hacer algo y hay que hacerlo ya. Y si algo hay que hacer en primer lugar es recuperar la dimensión ética de nuestra profesión, de nuestra escasez, de lo que somos y de lo que podemos llegar a ser. Porque pueden haber unos cuantos mandarines que piensen que lo nuestro es sólo una forma de hacer dinero pero yo sé que tú sabes que tu profesión es más, mucho más que un simple negocio.\n\nAún somos muchos y aún podemos conseguirlo todo pero esto no siempre seguirá siendo así. Es hora de actuar. Si nos determinamos a impedirlo tened la absoluta certeza de que la esperanza de los más quedará a salvo y que los menos no se saldrán con la suya.", "timestamp": 1633770785, "digest": "dvgcrLadQVCM4OqelZEH9ken9kAbwoMFzKitLBNj3sY", "contributor": "0xb5bF77b790f8185a6968F0B26f7Ff2610c1aAe42"}

{"id": "ea9PZ5uH9KMvrBnav2yw4vfjkYZwc25-Np_giK4DMSk", "title": "Mirror.xyz 对外开放后，我应该在上面发布什么内容？", "body": "作为 Web3 领域的标志性应用，社交媒体平台 Mirror.xyz 终于对外开放了，现在任何拥有以太坊账户的人都可以在上面撰写文章或发表其他形式更丰富的内容。\n\n但是我应该在上面做哪些尝试呢？或许应该先从关键词「Web3」开始思考，这是 Mirror.xyz 与其他社交媒体平台完全不同的地方。\n\nWeb3 作为一个前沿的概念，大家对于这个词的认知还是有很多分歧的，大致包含几种观点，比如「用户掌握自己的数据所有权」、「自由与开放 / 开源」、「去中心化」、「抗审查」等。而恰巧这些特点也可以通过区块链技术实现，所以 Web3 很多时候都和区块链技术有着非常强的绑定。\n\n具体来说，DeFi （去中心化金融）被加密货币社区认为是 Web3 在金融场景上的一种实现，在过去两年间它证明了拥有 Web3 的「可组合性」优势，其整体的效率和发展速度可以远超传统行业。另一个类似案例则是 NFT 标准在今年的大规模应用，让大量的数字化资产通过区块链网络流转，为新一代的基础网络提供了更丰富多样的资产种类。\n\n> DeFi 第一次让 Web3 用户感受到「可组合性」的魅力，而在金融场景之外，Mirror 很可能是 Web3 影响更广泛 Web2 用户群体的重要阵地。\n\nMirror.xyz 最令人兴奋的地方在于，它组合了多个区块链网络的优势：无需许可账户系统、永久存储、功能可扩展性等，但还能保持 Web2 级别的用户体验。毕竟还有大量用户尚未使用过加密货币或 Web3 平台，但是大多数互联网用户都用过博客或社交平台。\n\n正因为如此，作为一个泛用型的社交媒体平台，加密货币相关的内容应该只是 Mirror.xyz 的一个子集，而且占比越低越代表了 Mirror 的发展更健康。\n\n### 别再写 Crypto 的内容了！\n\nMirror 不是为加密货币行业定制的平台，它适合更广泛的内容创作者或者普通人。\n\n所以哪怕 Mirror 的早期用户可能有大量加密货币行业的从业者，而且早期内容还是会大量关注于加密货币行业的发展，但创作者完全可以利用这个平台逐渐替代传统的博客或者内容网站，所以并不存在内容题材上的限制。\n\n或许可以从 Crypto 逐渐扩展至泛科技、技术、艺术或者其他更垂直领域的内容，甚至也可以将其作为一个最普通的博客，记录那些你个人的东西，比如新的想法、认知或者是当作日记。\n\n### 探索机构和团队账户的场景\n\n除了适合个人开设 Mirror 账号之外，机构、团队、组织、DAO 也可以利用 Mirror 的特点，发布项目进展、披露公开信息、发布研究报告，甚至是借助 Web3 组件实现拍卖、公募等金融业务。\n\n如果从 Crypto 行业内来看，很多团队都在使用 Medium、微信公众号、Twitter、Substack 等平台公开项目进展的信息，这部分的内容完全可以用 Mirror 来替代，同时可以拥有内容永久存储、无法被平台运营方审查、可集成多样化的功能（比如金融）等各种优势。\n\n而在 Crypto 行业外，同样有这些需求，而且随着 NFT 和 DAO 的概念不断进入传统领域，Mirror 的优势可以很快显现出来。\n\n### 永存的内容，再也不担心审查和丢失\n\n永久存储真的是一个非常「可怕」的承诺，可能有人并不喜欢这个设定，但的确有太多的公共领域信息或私密信息可以在永久存储技术的帮助下，为人类实现一个公用数据库。\n\n在此之前互联网世界里的永久存储是交给一个名为 Internet Archive 的非营利组织实现的，也有一些第三方的服务可以提供类似功能，但这些通过信任第三方的机制不如区块链技术可靠，因为后者是可以通过技术手段和网络共识确保永存的。\n\nMirror 目前采用的是 Arweave 区块链实现内容的永存，不过随着 Arweave 网络的成熟和更多去中心化存储网络的兴起，总会有越来越好用的技术可以被 Mirror 集成。\n\n所以对于 Mirror 的用户来说，内容因为硬件故障丢失或者被政府机构审查删除的情况就不用担心了，所有内容都会安全的存放在 Arweave 上。哪怕未来 Mirror 的前端会适应各地法律而不得不进行审查，也是没关系的，因为 Arweave 网络中总会储存该内容，而且会被 Arweave 的大量节点冗余备份。\n\n也期待 Mirror 可以将入口、域名解析、数据传输层迁移至去中心化的网络，这样也就彻底无法被审查了。\n\n### 体验 Web3 的「可组合性」\n\n永存之外，Mirror 的另一个魅力就是强大的功能扩展性，可以从体验 Mirror 上集成的 Web3 控件开始。\n\nMirror 的 [编辑指南](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/editor) 显示，目前已经支持了在文章嵌入各种多媒体或者其他功能模块，包括：\n\n* NFT 展示（以太坊）\n* 众筹模块\n* 拍卖模块\n* 图片\n* 链接及预览\n* Twitter 预览\n* 视频类多媒体（Youtube 或自托管）\n* 其他框架（比如 WebGL 的可交互内容）\n\n除此之外，Mirror 还有不少功能尚未完全对外开放，比如拍卖模块、代币竞赛模块等。\n\nMirror 本身作为一个开放的社区，也开放了 Discord 频道，所有人都可以去社区参与讨论，提出产品改进建议，每个人都可以参与 Mirror 的共建。\n\n### 不想从零开始？试试看一键迁移\n\n对于使用其他传统博客或者媒体平台的个人或者项目团队而言，Mirror 也开发了迁移功能，可以将 Medium 或 Substack 等平台中的内容完全迁移至 Mirror 中。导入的内容将会被转换为 Markdown 格式，这也是很多平台默认支持的文本编辑语法。\n\n这样导入过来的内容也可以借助 Mirror 集成 Arweave 的永存特性，也相当于做了内容的备份，而对于新的内容则可以借助上述 Mirror 的其他特性。\n\n### 最重要的是：释放想象力！\n\n虽然很多时候会将 Mirror 类比为博客或社交媒体平台，但这种思维定势或许会束缚创作者的想象力。\n\n我认为从根本上来说，Mirror 是有望为内容创作者提供一个多元化的平台，通过提供各种各样的工具（支付、众筹、版税），既可以打通创作者和粉丝之间的连接，还能寻找适合自己的经济模式或收入来源。\n\n比如已经有电影制作公司通过 Mirror 的众筹模块募资，然后为资助的用户空投对应的代币和 NFT，作为一种纪念。（[Ethereum: The Infinite Garden](https://ethereumfilm.mirror.xyz/3SV8gLXHIW8Ot45h3RL7aOgDINxN2hjLfFVOvyatB2A)）\n\n另外，内容创作者也能通过「众筹模块」获取资助，然后进行各种形式的创作，比如深度研究、行业报告、产品体验、艺术创作，或者也可以利用「拍卖模块」出售内容、广告、作品等。\n\n还有更多我现在也无法想象出的用例。\n\n### Web3 时代很快就要来了！\n\n除了内容平台 Mirror 之外，其他类的 Web3 应用也在很快发展。\n\n> 比如，NFT 标准可以扩张 Web3 的资产类别，Radicle 探索开发者协作工具，EthSign 专注电子签名，Meson 和 Theta 解决去中心化的流量分发，Livepeer 和 Golem 提供计算网络，ENS 和 DAS 提供身份和域名解析，Gitcoin 和 CLRFund 解决公共物品资助难题。\n\n而这些应用也证明了一件事：区块链不仅可以实现 DeFi 业务，还能成为这些 Web3 组件不可或缺的基础设施。", "timestamp": 1633771290, "digest": "cKyqVNmjG-6b2jRseq086hEU5wCTBoOGp6WTRpyGH1U", "contributor": "0x96e95a6A41e95613261402F4E437ddf1D75D0F87"}

When a team member gives their notice to leave, it’s personal *and* straightforward.\n\n## When the Notice is Given\n\nI knew that the notice was coming. It would be rare that I was caught off-guard. The lingering *spidey sense* I’ve felt had been correct. I’ve lived with the “yeah, it’s coming” weeks prior. The tip-off was the questions they ask, the doubts they have, and odd days out of office. And for those that care, a burst of contributions.\n\nThen there is a request for a rare one-on-one before the week is out. *It’s here.*\n\nAs we go through the motions, I listen, ask questions, and find levers to negotiate. But rarely do I find something to keep the person on, their mind already made up. I respect that.\n\nWhen I close the video meeting, I settle. My mind is racing. “Can I try something to bring the person back?” A list of grievances sets in, and I go through a loss cycle for days. It’s a breakup. I let go.\n\n## What Happens Later\n\nAs I execute communications with the team, crafting the transition plan and the celebratory send-off, I ask myself, “What could have been different?” There are answers. I could have improved the environment, the work, the team — myself. I write the conclusions down to be taken care of, reflecting on what I’ve learned.\n\nThere are moments during the transition where I battle an aggravated ego. But I check myself, calm down, and refocus back on this individual. I want them to succeed, and me stepping to hinder that would be incorrect. I’ll send recommendations and smile. They will become a better person because of this, and so will I.\n\nOnce the person leaves, team nature dislikes a vacuum. There are opportunities for others. They step up and stretch. No one is irreplaceable, and no one is an island. But the knowledge is lost, eminence gone, and it’s a pivot, for now, this new team.\n\n## Self Reflections\n\nThis notice is not the first nor the last I’ll experience. Nor will the team. It is a continual procession of people, *great people doing their very best*. But this role wasn’t a fit, and the timing was off. The environment was not correct. The work didn’t have the impact they wanted, finding *their* dream job instead. Perhaps I was ineffective at communications, championing above, or slow at sponsoring elsewhere. Or the baffling outcome, their asks *were all *achieved as they exit.\n\nAnd occasionally, the [software engineer](https://dev.to/solidi/what-is-a-software-engineer-anyway-3fb2) realized that the job was hard. They weren’t performing. They knew, and so did I. And on that occasion, it’s a relief.\n\nThen I reflect on all of those managers that had experienced the same with me. I’ve left a few jobs this way. Now I understand a bit more. It’s just business, but in no way do I sense that people can be that *frosty*. Each experience resonates.\n\nAnd for those teams where I got up and left as the manager. There was a special memory leaving them where they stood. I wasn’t expecting those intense feelings when walking away the first time. They don’t write that in *any* of the books I read.\n\n## The Continual Graceful Exit\n\nThe good news is there are plenty of opportunities in [software engineering](https://medium.com/hackernoon/software-is-unlike-construction-c0284ee4b723). It’s comforting. Fluidity is what I like about the industry; it eats the world. [And in some way, it grinds.](https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-manager-stew-dd59cd653728)\n\nIn my experience, there is an interesting observation. Once an engineer, and now as a manager, many people have come and gone. In software, *people do fire themselves, *as in they leave of their own volition*. *It’s hardly the other way around.\n\nMy goal is to treat someone well on their first as well as their last. I want the chance to [cooperate later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evolution_of_Cooperation). While I don’t have much evidence on how other managers handle these situations, a *graceful* exit between us leads to better future outcomes. And that is how we say goodbye.\n", "timestamp": 1633771430, "digest": "SxLnCzHVX4nZ375vmsRiw2brHltM-NPlvc6O5VkuV6Q", "contributor": "0x96e95a6A41e95613261402F4E437ddf1D75D0F87"}

Solarpunk 中的“朋克”是关于反叛、反文化、后资本主义、非殖民主义和热情。这是关于走向与主流不同的方向，主流越来越朝着可怕的方向发展。 5. Solarpunk 既是一种运动，也是一种流派：它不仅关乎故事，还关乎我们如何到达那里。 6. Solarpunk 包含多种策略：做 Solarpunk 没有单一的正确方法。相反，来自世界各地的不同社区采用了这个名字和想法，并建立了自我维持革命的小巢。 7. Solarpunk 提供了一种有价值的新视角、范式和词汇，用来描述一个可能的未来。与拥抱复古未来主义不同，solarpunk 完全着眼于未来。不是替代的未来，而是可能的未来。 8. 我们的未来主义不像赛博朋克那样虚无主义，它避免了蒸汽朋克潜在的准反动倾向：它是关于独创性、创造力、独立性和社区。 9. Solarpunk 强调环境可持续性和社会正义。 10. Solarpunk 是要找到让我们现在以及我们的后代的生活更加美好的方法。 11. 我们的未来必须涉及从我们已有的东西中重新利用和创造新事物。想象一下，“智慧城市”被抛弃而有利于智慧公民。 12. Solarpunk 认识到政治和科幻小说对彼此的历史影响。 13. Solarpunk 认为科幻小说不仅是娱乐，而且是一种激进主义形式。 14. Solarpunk 想要应对地球即将死亡、贫富差距无法克服以及社会被企业控制的场景。不是在 100 年之后，而是触手可及。 15. Solarpunk 是关于青年创客文化、本地解决方案、本地能源网络、创建自主功能系统的方法。这是关于爱这个世界。 16. 太阳能朋克文化包括所有文化、宗教、能力、性别、性别和性身份。 17. Solarpunk 是人类实现社会进化的理念，它不仅包含宽容，而且包含更广泛的同情和接受。 18. Solarpunk 的视觉美学是开放和进化的。就目前而言，它是以下内容的混搭： 19. Solarpunk 的未来是根据新城市主义或新步行主义和环境可持续性的原则建造的。20.

{"id": "YZpQT6g2maQKS_bMLUuD-qhbS09tQbBOsEYf17DVIv0", "title": "Mirror.xyz 产品初体验：通向 Web3 内容创作的一道窄门", "body": "> 链闻曾在今年年初，Mirror.xyz 产品发布后不久，[撰文介绍](https://www.chainnews.com/articles/859231688546.htm) 过这个新型内容创作平台的雏形。经过近一年发展，Mirror 的功能和体验不断完善，在本月初向所有用户开放了写作功能，Mirror 还为创作者提供了众筹和投票等基础能力。现在，是时候体验下这些功能了。\n\n**原文标题：《Mirror.xyz 通向 web3.0 的一道窄门》 \n 撰文：侠客张**\n\n简单理解，Mirror 是一个采用区块链技术的内容创作平台，普遍认为它是去中心化版本的 medium。\n\n我个人更喜欢 Mirror 一篇文章中对它自身的定位：\n\n**What is Mirror = Who’s on Mirror**\n\n从这个定义来看，Mirror 不仅仅是一个去中心的内容创作工具，它更像是一个社区协作平台。\n\n我们先来看下目前 Mirror 能做什么：\n\n### Mirror 提供的能力\n\n当前阶段，Mirror 为创作者提供了 6 个基础能力工具，包括**发布文章**（Entries）、**众筹**（Crowdfunds）、**数字藏品**（Editions）、**拍卖**（Auctions）、**合作贡献分流**（Splits）、**社区投票**（Token Race）。\n\n#### 发布文章（Entries）\n\n当前阶段，Mirror 的发布文章能力已经面向所有人开放，访问 [这里](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/entries)，即可开始在线发布。\n\nMirror 支持文章的一键导入功能，可以将自己在其他平台发布的文章通过链接方式一键导入。（亲测公众号不行，被屏蔽了）\n\nMirror 的在线编辑器采用纯文本+Markdown 的格式，同时支持内部构建块的快速引用。\n\n最大的亮点是每一个 Mirror 的功能块都可以在文章中快速引用，并提供直接预览。比如众筹和 NFT 功能，直接在文章中就可以完成购买操作。\n\n文章编辑功能的详细操作可参考 [官方手册](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/editor)。\n\n在发布文章页面的右上角，可以设置文章的发布形式。勾选 NFT 选项，文章会作为数字藏品发布，读者可以购买该文章作为收藏。\n\n点击齿轮可以选择是否将文章发布到链上，public 即是将文章发布到 Arweave 分布式存储区块链上。（需要缴纳较高的网络费）\n\n对于每一个发布到链上的文章，在文章最下方会看到链上存储的唯一地址。可以实现文章的完全的去中心化访问。\n\n#### 众筹（Crowdfunds）\n\n像传统的众筹平台一样，Mirror 的众筹功能允许为项目或创意筹集资金。与传统的众筹平台不同，Mirror 的优势在于可以快速启动一个 DAO。\n\nMirror 众筹亮点主要包括：\n\n* 支持者通过支持一个项目获得代币。这代表了项目社区的成员资格。\n* 支持 NFTs。可以采用数字原生藏品来奖励支持者，这些收藏品的价值可能会增长，并可作为社区成员的标志。\n* **众筹前三名贡献者，会获得独特的 NFT。**这是区分项目的超级粉丝和顶级支持者的好方法，并为活动引入了类似拍卖的竞争元素。\n\n当前阶段，Mirror 的众筹能力已经面向所有人开放，访问 [此处](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/crowdfunds)，即可发起一个众筹。\n\n**Mirror 的众筹工具已被证明是组建 DAO 的最简单方式，一个互联网原生社区可以通过众筹和 NFTs，快速的确认参与者和形成初始资金筹集。**\n\n#### 社区投票（Token Race）\n\n对于一个成熟的 DAO 来说，投票是最重要的应用。这代表了 DAO 参与者对任一决议的集体倾向和决定。\n\nMirror 的投票功能与 Snapshot 类似，提供了投票提案、令牌快照、多重签名、代理投票等能力。\n\n使用 Mirror 投票的好处是它与 Mirror 的其他构建块可以紧密的集成。通过一篇文章，创作者阐述了一个项目的创意，通过一个众筹，召集了社区的初始成员。最后通过投票，对社区的各类决议进行实施。我们看到的是创作者社区的能力闭环。\n\n### Mirror 的潜在价值\n\nWEB3 有一个重要的特征，就是价值流与信息流的合并。\n\n在 WEB2 时代，各类媒体提供信息，用户获取信息到反馈价值，是一个很漫长的链路，有的通过付费，有的通过广告，有的通过社区等等，但基本都**很难实现信息获取即价值回馈**。\n\nMirror 可以是一个 DAO 的融合工具，也可以是一个创新项目孵化器。它不仅可以为分布式协作提供强大的创作工具和能力，同时也是面向加密世界的一个路演平台。\n\n如果你有一个想法，使用 Mirror 可以快速的对想法进行分步落地：\n\n1. 发表一片文章说明你要做的事，一个什么项目或产品，亦或是写一篇研报或者拍一部电影。\n2. 针对这个想法创建一个众筹。这是建立链接的关键一步。\n3. 在你的圈子内传播它，找到愿意参与的用户。让早期用户通过众筹参与到该项目中。\n4. 通过筹集到的资金落实自己的想法。在这个过程中，可以通过 Discord 等形式，召集社区用户参与讨论。可以通过投票方式决定路线图。\n5. 落实资金使用，可以通过投票的方式分配资金用途。\n6. 发布成果，以 NFT 举例，可以将成果包装为 NFT 竞拍。收益可以按照众筹份额分配等等。\n7. 过程中的每一次创作，每一个投票，都可以是一篇 Mirror 文章。每一篇文章中都可以包含众筹和 NFT 竞拍，这即是路演，也是销售。\n8. 这些形式最终会将创作和价值反馈融合，这很摇滚！\n\n**Mirror 出于加密圈，但它服务的对象远不止加密圈。每一个个人和 DAO，不同的行业背景，都可以使用 Mirror 作为价值发现平台，通过它打开一道通向 WEB3.0 的门。**\n\n### 个人的尝试\n\n对于未来的工作形态，我个人有过一些思考。长期在一个企业里，感觉不够有趣。长期一个人单打独斗，可能会过于孤独。DAO 或许会是一个不错的选择，但我并未真正参与过一个 DAO 中，或许时机不够成熟，或许缘分未到。\n\nMirror 的出现，Diacord 的流行，让我看到了一个可能，或许它会发展为一个 DAO，或许它是我个人创作的另一个形态，但不管怎样，它都是一次新的尝试。\n\n在实践中去体验产品是我一贯的行为准则，这次也不例外。要深度研究 Mirror 这个产品，试图去找到未来 Web 3.0 的杀手应用，就要亲身参与进去。", "timestamp": 1633771362, "digest": "xWOVdXR1Zs1eSaYbGtCR_u9wHAQnManGDpTcMcAGV2s", "contributor": "0x96e95a6A41e95613261402F4E437ddf1D75D0F87"}

他们有钱有势。我们主要有我们的大脑、我们的社区和GM。 但这可能就足够了， 2/ 退一步。 自 2013 年 BTC 夏季以来，6529 一直参与加密。 从第一天起，我就确信 BTC 及其继任者会改变世界，让世界变得更美好，将权力从瓶颈下放，这对人类来说是一件好事, 3/ 我在 BTC 的发展和接受中扮演了一个小角色。 事情的计划很小，但对我来说很重要，而且在当时，这是一个“冒险”的举动。 从那时起，我一直在等待我们更加去中心化的社会系统出现。 还有等待，等待…… 4/ 6529 有“机构证书”。 我对“系统”非常满意，而且系统对我很好。 在我们目前的系统中，我不是输家，我是赢家。 但我的心在加密，我花了很多时间在加密 IRL 上，并且对加密了解很多。 5/ 直到 2 月和几个月内，我才认真研究 NFT.... ...嗯，我喜欢 JPG，到了夏天，我有了相当多的 NFT 投资组合。 那么接下来呢？ 6/ 简单的选择就是坐下来放松一下。 享受我的 IRL 生活，同时看着漂亮的 JPG 制作大量 ETH，这与 6529 可以达到的 4 级差不多。 也许我什至可以说服自己这是第 5 级（“我正在通过艺术实现自我”）, 7/ 但我遇到了一个问题，那个问题是我可以看到一个窗口、一个虫洞、一个杠杆，可能会导致一个开放的元界。 这是世界上最重要的事情之一 ， 这是一个非常狭窄的窗口，范围和时间都有限 ， 很快，为时已晚，8/ 抱怨世界不应该是它应该的样子，而对此却无所作为，这是很容易的。 事实上，通常在导致我们抱怨的确切问题的同时（嗨，单点故障 Twitter 上的加密家族，在这里看着你）， 谈话很便宜。 9/生命短暂，然后你死了。 如果 4 级和 5 级的人喜欢我（以及很多加密货币喷水鲸鱼 s) 不愿意在权力下放的游戏中加入一些皮肤，那么我们就是

他们将保持主权存在。 我们不会梦游进入一个由少数对大数据、支持机器学习的系统具有“上帝视角”的人控制的全景监狱社会。 13/ 这听起来很戏剧化，但这个话题的趋势线很糟糕。ZG早就离开了。 而美国和欧盟正朝着错误的方向蔓延。 所以我们需要在它变得不可逆转之前立即采取行动。 14/ 立即行动是一个不容错过的命题： 如果辩护者是对的，系统没有中心化，那么我们的去中心化努力将受到政府和公司的欢迎， 如果我们不受欢迎，那么我们采取的行动将是一件好事， 15/ 对于这里的新手，请先阅读理论。 慢慢来，我们会等你的。 https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1429399891491577858 ， https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1429399894339604485 ，

标准，这也将是一场漫长的推特风暴，Twitter 会让我分阶段进行。 有推文时请耐心等待。我们完成后会通知您， 17/ 我的观点是元节的默认结果将是中心化的。 大型科技公司拥有资金、人才、广泛的影响力，而且有趣的是，民族国家会全力支持和鼓励国家行使更多控制权，而不是减少控制权。 18/ 那么我们还剩下什么？ 只有一件事比金钱、影响力、人才和联邦政府的巨大权力更强大。 一件事是共享的神话或模因。 模因是社会的最高对象。 19/ 在像美国和欧洲这样的消费主义民主国家，模因选举政治家，他们推动消费（和企业收益）并确定整个社会的方向。 顺便说一句，该系统也擅长模因。 看看下面两个不错的， 但... 20/ ...我们现在有了 NFT，这是有史以来开发的强大模因技术。 与过去不同，任何人都可以拥有强大模因的一部分。 “媒体就是消息”，目前有一个开放空间，距离系统认领媒体还有一段距离。 我们现在必须抓住它。 21/ 我希望你从今天带走执行计划的两条主要信息： 1) NFT 是人， 2) 模因>土地， wtf又在说6529了？ 22/“NFT 就是人” 在每一个朋克、BAYC、酷猫、wassie、toadz 的背后，都有一个活生生的人。 决定如何过自己的生活，花钱的地方，志愿服务的时间以及投票给谁的人。 23/ 10,000 朋克是一个开放的公开可读但匿名的数据库，其中包含最坚信加密、NFT 和未来的某些事情的人 ， 考虑一下， 然后再想想， 然后再想一想，直到你的下巴碰到地板， 24/ 对于 BAYC、squiggles、酷猫、wassies、toadz 也是如此。 NFT 是身份和社会组织的结合，具有零成员资格标准，完全全球化，可组合。 任何人都可以为朋克制作产品以选择加入， 25/ 我们从未有过如此强大的社交组织工具。 NFT 与 BTC 是同一类解决方案，但更松散、更抽象、更人性化。 购买 BAYC 不会让您遵守“仅限 2100 万比特币”等超级严格的规则，但这没关系，因为人类是不可替代的， 26/ 每个 BAYC 持有者都可以从 BAYC 中提取和解释自己的含义。 对于每个人来说，它不会也不应该是完全相同的事情。 我们是人，不是无人机。 但平均而言，BAYC 持有者的想法/行为会比非 BAYC 持有者更相似。 27/ 这就是所有社会神话建设机构的运作方式。 共和党， 民主党， 天主教会， 美国海军陆战队， 美国公民自由联盟， 绿色和平 ， 每个成员都不同，但该小组有广泛协调的目标。 28/ NFT 社区将完全如此。 有些人会成为真正献身的真信徒。 有些会有所帮助， 有些人会一起去兜风， 有些人会在那里享用免费的比萨饼和啤酒， 有些会被敌人派去破坏演出 ， 这很好，很正常。 29/ 为什么我要对你们所有人说“gm”？ 因为它提醒人们，这些化身背后是现实生活中的人。 我在家里，在工作中，在咖啡馆里对人们说“通用”。 我为什么不也对你说gm呢？ 还有，通用， 30/ 模因>土地 ， 我相信 Metaverse 将会到来，而且会非常精彩。 十年后，分辨率会高，功能会丰富，多巴胺陷阱会磨练到完美。 所以我花了很多时间担心这个，\n\n31/我为什么要担心这个？ 因为“从一无所有开始并构建获胜的分散式元节技术堆栈”不是一个可以获胜的家族项目。 与数百个试图做同样事情的竞争对手的噩梦般的战斗，拥有无限的企业和风险投资预算， 32/ 所以我一直在努力解决的问题是“如果我们打算去建立一个 6529 去中心化的元宇宙，这意味着什么？” 我们都去 Decentraland 买地块吗？索尼姆？ OnCyber 中的画廊？到明年，还会增加 100 个。 33/ 这些似乎都不是制胜策略。 这基本上是在押注人类的未来“你会在竞争最激烈的科技领域的成功平台上做出正确的风险投资吗” 太难。回到绘图板。 34/ 我必须在这件事上努力工作。真的很难。这是我最需要扩展思路的部分。 这真的很难。即使在今天，我也只是看到了它的轮廓。地平线上有一丝微光，但我看到了。 35/ 我对这个问题的回答是“模因>土地”，控制模因比您呈现它们的特定元节技术堆栈更重要。 再来？这是什么意思？例子，永远是例子。 36/ 如果卢浮宫被烧毁，如果混凝土和钢铁都消失了，但蒙娜丽莎得救了。 结束了吗？我们完成了蒙娜丽莎吗？ Bin 她，继续吗？ 还是我们建造新的卢浮宫、新的混凝土、新的钢材？ 卢浮宫很美，但可以更换。蒙娜丽莎不是。 37/让我们在我们的世界里玩这个游戏 ， 你会来 OnCyber 看阳光吗？你会在 Decentraland 见到他吗？在Somnium怎么样？ 在“接下来会发生什么？”中呢？ 我的回答，我的投票，我的直觉是“是”。 如果是这样，夏天.jpg >土地， 38/ 因此，按照这个逻辑，我将列出计划的前两部分。 别着急，还有5个。 “NFT 是人”的意思是 6529 Fam， 39/ 这意味着我们中的一些人，今天可能有 50,000，6 个月后可能有 500,000，几年后可能有 5,000,000，几年后可能有 50,000,000 相信元宇宙应该开放 ， 我们每个人都可以在这场战斗中发挥小小的作用， 40/ 对于大多数人来说，我会为小动作而激动。 也许你可以和你的朋友谈谈？也许你会在地方选举中投票给控制力稍弱的候选人。也许你会学会在非托管钱包中持有 NFT？ 有足够多的人，这很重要， 41/ 但是 6529，6529 fam 现在 100% 由 www dot twitter dot com 集中和控制。 是的，这是正确的，这是不好的，我们将改变它。 6529 fam 中的每个人都将获得一个免费的 NFT，无论是现在还是永远（您可能需要支付汽油费用）， 42/ 我是一名稀有狙击手收藏家。我很擅长。 但是超级昂贵是建立一个大型社区来改变世界的愚蠢方式。 理想情况下，6529 fam 的入场价格应为 0 美元。目前，这将是 ETH 上的 gas 成本，但及时其他 L1/L2，为什么不呢？ 43/ 我们需要一个 6529 Fam NFT，这样我们就可以在未经许可的情况下找到彼此。 会有路线图吗？不， 治理令牌？也没有， 价格会上涨吗？井供应是无限的， 我们会怎样做？任何你想要的， 44/@6529er 一直在做某事。这不是最终的，但它表明了我们前进的方向。 这是决赛吗？我们还不确定，但它正朝着这个方向发展。 45/但是如果它是免费的，我们不会有信噪比的问题吗？ 是的，是的，事实上我们会的。我们需要一个反女巫攻击措施。看到卡片中的“第 1 代”了吗？ 我昨晚拍下了这个帐户的推特粉丝的快照，这将是身份验证密钥， 46/ 我有可能在接下来的几天里再拍一张。 我相信我知道我打算怎么做，但我想测试一下，所以我保留改变主意的权利。 但是“免费”和女巫攻击一起发生，所以我会反击， 47/ fam卡上的时间是什么时候？ 我想接下来的几周。 如果您错过了快照怎么办？ 别着急，还有一个。 我不是要排除人，而是要保留信号。在线程的最后有更多关于这个的信息。 48/ 让我们转到项目 2：6529 城市。 6529 Fam 是完全抽象的，完全去中心化的，但由于这个原因，我认为它非常强大。 这只是相信去中心化的人朝这个方向迈出的一种方式。 “城市”是更具体的一步， 49/ 今天，我们生活在一个由 twitter 和 discord 头像和 opensea 以及一些各种虚拟陆地平台组成的元宇宙中。 一点一点地，这个元节将变得更真实、更有形、更形象、更丰富、更引人入胜， 50/ 10 年后，我相信你不会成为我笔记本电脑屏幕上基于文本的提要中的 24 x 24 像素头像。 10 年后，我们将在某种感觉非常真实的增强和虚拟现实中感到不寒而栗。 因此，在此过程中，我们将朝那个方向采取步骤， 51/这是什么意思？我们将在各种元宇宙中开设商店，并开始感受获取更多实质内容的感觉。 就目前而言，他们拥有什么参数并不是很重要，因为我认为技术堆栈会一次又一次地改变。 我想要感觉， 52/ 我非常喜欢在我的画廊工作@oncyber_io 所以在接下来的几个月里，我将在那里测试不同的想法。 它是去中心化的吗？只是在某些方面。可以抱我吗？并不真地。我可以拿起郁金香去别的地方， 53/ 今天的 OnCyber 会成为我们梦寐以求的元宇宙吗？不，绝对不是。 但是我们需要开始尝试使用 UX、UI 和交互来了解哪些有效，哪些无效。 你一定要来OnCyber吗？不，开始到处玩， 54/ 这让我想到了一个严肃的观点，一个重要的观点，为什么我要为 6529 博物馆收藏，为什么我在 JPG 上花费了数百万美元。 我在纽约生活了很多年，所以纽约的类比对我来说很容易。 所以让我们考虑一些类比， 55/ 为什么现代艺术博物馆对纽约很重要？是礼品店吗？是咖啡馆吗？当然不是。 MoMA 的价值在于： a) 吸引游客到纽约， b) 提高居民的生活质量， c)传递关于城市创新的信息并吸引人们来到纽约， 56/ 换句话说，MoMA 为纽约市提供公共物品（正外部性）。 这也是 6529 博物馆的重点。将为6529城提供公共产品、正外部性 ， 这不仅仅是一般的策略，它特别是我的收集计划， 57/ 我没有收集最大化投资回报率或美学。我一直在收集以最大化“难以复制” 为什么？如果我是对的，总有一天会变得更加富有的人和机构将开始购买 NFT 并将淹没我。 物有所值，对 6529 博物馆不利， 58/如果6529博物馆只有15个高质量的朋克，它会是10年后元宇宙中的重要博物馆吗？可能不是。其他人会有更多 ，， 所以我一直在寻找只有5个、10个、20个机构才能做到的收藏主题，所以博物馆会保持独特， 59/ 特别是，我放大了早期链上生成艺术的水平集合，尤其是艺术块策划，未来只能有几个。 我改天再讨论细节， 60/ 相同的逻辑适用于垂直波浪线集合。 整个 Metaverse 中只有 20 个地方可以看到所有波浪线类型，6529 City 将是其中之一。 和 10 个有变体完美或全谱的之一。\n\n61/ 这不是吹嘘或赚更多钱，而是因为模因>土地。 ， 构建或控制永久差异化的 JPG 收藏是在 Metaverse 中获得影响力的一种更具成本效益的方式，而不是尝试构建获胜的收藏， 62/然后是我们的超级模因战士，即使我们没有其他 JPG，这两个 JPG 也可能足以让一个分散的城市和国家独自拥有权益， 63/ 所以我们的目标不是建立元节的 MoMA，而是元节的 NYC。 6529博物馆是我在游戏中的皮肤。 是我投入了数千万美元，很快将成为数亿美元的公共物品，然后说“我全力以赴”， 64/或者，换句话说，这是6529城的计划， 65/好的，但我们具体要做什么？ 我不知道。我将朝着某个方向前进，如果你喜欢它并想一起做有趣和有趣的事情，那就太好了。 如果你不这样做，那也很棒。 66/但我不想住在6529城，我想住在罪恶之城或迈阿密城或月猫城！ 伟大的！您仍然可以成为 6529 Fam 的一员并建立您的 MoonCat Miami Beach City。 我的城市拟物主义跑到纽约，所以这就是我对城市的看法，但那是个人的。 67/ 如果你制作了一个很酷的 Mooncats-on-Miami-Beach，那么我们都可以参观。 元节的伟大之处在于我们都只需点击一下， 68/好的，接下来是什么？ 好吧，我们有一些有趣的信息想要发送给全世界，而我自己无法完成所有这些信息，因此我们需要一个平台来发布这些信息。 所以名单上的#3 是 6529 Studio，一个专注于外展、乐趣和实验的 NFT 工作室， 69/ 6529 Studio 将有三个通用系列： WAGMI：大集合（> 1,000 到更多），旨在让人们加入 NFT ，单击：要制作的稀有游戏收藏@Vince*Van*Dough 我的膝盖很虚弱 ， wut：我们想尝试的奇怪的东西， 70/ 我很高兴地告诉您，6529 Studios 的第一个项目是帮助将阳光推向世界。 @XCOPYART 从我收集summer.jpg的那天起我就一直在谈论这个 ， 我们都同意阳光不应该只是坐在6529博物馆的墙上， 70/ 因此，我们正在共同努力，将 Sunshine 带到全世界，成为我们 WAGMI 到世界其他地方的大使。 发射不是迫在眉睫，而是暗示我们在想什么：“阳光”， 71/ 第二个项目将是“No Shame”，其灵感来自于惊人的@dmitricherniak 工作“我修复了这个错误真是太可惜了” ， 作为@dmitricherniak 说：一些最好的美和艺术来自错误，我们不应该为它们感到羞耻，我们应该庆祝它们。 72/ 该项目的近期目标广泛地鼓励艺术家分享他们最好的“错误”作品。 @dmitricherniak 好心地接受为这个项目策划一些作品。 但更广泛地说，我们希望帮助艺术家建立对自己声音的信心。 73/ 有更多的项目在筹备中，更多的想法，但这两个应该能让你了解我们的想法。 与其他一切一样，6529 Studio 正在执行任务， 74/ 下一个项目，6529 资本。 有组织的资本将进入这个领域，而且规模也会扩大。它将淹没早期的本地 NFT 个人。 既然这会发生，不妨用柔术来服务去中心化的目标， 75/ 我很自豪地宣布一个非凡的团队将（与我一起）在这个项目上工作，其中一些是世界上最优秀的收藏家。 我不认为我可以公正地对待他们，所以我只想脱口而出： @krybharat @ac*collecting @bonafidehan @phon*ro， 76/ 我还要感谢团队允许我制作我一生中最喜欢的幻灯片。77/ 我认为出于各种原因，至少有一些资本提供者留在 NFT 本地人手中很重要，我将在后面解释 ， 如果您认为您可以在这里提供帮助，请与我们联系， 78/ 下一个：6529 教育 ， 我不会花太多时间在这上面，因为这是显而易见的。 我们需要大量的教育来帮助船上的人并在该领域取得成功。 推特风暴很棒，但我们需要更多结构化的内容。也将在这方面工作， 79/ 6529 实验室 ， 目标是一个开放的元节。开放的元节将不仅仅是 6529 fam。 我将开放的元宇宙视为一系列环绕全球的城邦和社区。 因此，我们将尝试开源我们可以帮助其他人也构建的内容。 80/ 我在这里想到的项目类型的一个很好的例子是去中心化的开源许可证构建器，它允许艺术家传达他们想要使用的精确许可证。 这不会仅仅由 6529 Labs 建造，但我们可以帮助催化该项目， 81/ 6529 政策 ， 这是稍后，但随着时间的推移，我们将需要最终影响现实世界的变化。 我现在正在标记这个，我相信我会在明年初回来， 82/现在让我们休息一下，玩得开心@6529er . 我们之前说过，fam 卡是免费的，可以最大限度地访问，这是正确的！ 但朋克成为一种信号的原因之一是人们在购买（或不出售朋克）时将皮肤放入游戏中， 83/ 所以我们也会在 6529 Collection 中进行一些小实验，它不属于 Studio 的一部分，只是 6529 想要做的有趣的事情do. @6529er 制作了 6529 标志，它是我见过的最令人印象深刻的标志之一， 84/ 现在是时候以 6529 Gradient 的艺术家身份更正式地向世界介绍他了，这是他对自己标志的诠释。 它是从全白到全黑的 100 种不同色调的徽标 ， 这是#0、#33、#67、#100， 85/ 这个收藏将更加分散。 每个图像都将作为 SVG 在链上铸造，并在 IPFS 上“备份”。 如果 IPFS 和 ETH 在未来的某个时候都不起作用，那么每个人都很有趣，但加密没有成功。 86/这里的模型是什么？ 我们将铸造这些并保留一些并以完全根据我们的奇思妙想和时间表确定的速度拍卖一些。 如果我们解决这个问题，#1 将在明天拍卖。 我们肯定会为 6529 博物馆保留 #0。 87/ 有路线图吗？不 有治理代币吗？不 一个金库来扫地怎么样？不 为什么只有100个？因为我们提供了 80,000 个免费 NFT，而且还在计算中！ 你应该买吗？只要你喜欢@6529er 以您能负担得起的价格展示艺术品。 88/我第一次设定历史最高价是完美光谱曲线。 PS 波浪线是一个书呆子的选择，不如 HyperRainbows 华丽，但更具数学性。 我也以这种方式查看渐变徽标， 89/ 另外，还有一件事。 #50 会特别特别。 就像我们的朋友一样，它会移动。 祝你好运摆脱我的手@6529er， 90/ 现在还有一些事情，我们总结一下。 在过去的几周里，我带了一些种子投资者进入 6529，主要是因为他们非常大大脑， 我没有警告他们是超级线程，所以我不打算对他们进行 dox，但让我们说他们是去中心化中家喻户晓的名字。 91/ 他们可以根据自己的选择决定是否使用 dox，但无论如何，他们已经在加密货币上花费了很多时间，他们的心在正确的地方，我希望他们会喜欢完成这项任务。 92/我再介绍一下： @6529Guardian 谁是千兆-大脑加密监管律师在 6529 团队中帮助确保系统不会在技术问题上抓住我们 & @itsjpower 具有加密和金融背景，正在构建我们的端到端基础设施， 93/ 之前有人问过我，所以我会说。我，在这里发推文的人，是个人。 我也没有对任何机构或其他人做出任何承诺 6529。 如果我说我会做某事，我就可以承诺。 94/换句话说，你仍然必须信任我，但你有一个信任点，那就是我。 我不是其他终极最终 Boss 的代理人。 对于您在未来几年遇到的大多数机构和人来说，情况并非如此。 95/ 因为我提前思考，你不必完全信任我，一个人，而是我专门为完成这项任务而建立的信任。 因此，如果我不幸遭遇了水上摩托艇事故\\*，表演将继续进行。 \\*虽然请让警察仔细检查一下，但有点可疑， 96/ 现在您很兴奋并想以某种特定方式提供帮助，请联系： @6529capital @6529studio （团队/艺术家） @6529Labs

Sólo, a veces, su egolatría les conduce a la catástrofe; como me relata a veces Dionisio Moreno —el abogado que defendió a Aziz en el famoso caso que cambió la jurisprudencia en el mundo de las hipotecas—, si el banco se había hecho allanado y había transaccionado el asunto con Aziz la sentencia que cambió todo el panorama hipotecario jamás se habría producido pues Aziz no pretendía cambiar el mundo ni la jurisprudencia, sino solo defender su derecho. Fue la egolatría,\n\nEn general los ciudadanos no actúan ante estos tribunales de justicia persiguiendo que fijen unas líneas jurisprudenciales que favorezcan a los particulares, se limitan a litigar tratando de obtener justicia en su concreto y caso particular, no son usuarios intensivos como bancos y aseguradoras de la administración de justicia.\n\nLos usuarios intensivos y poderosos económicamente de la administración de justicia, precisamente por ser usuarios intensivos, gozan de importantísimas ventajas: pueden seleccionar los casos que llevarán a apelación, casación o amparo, de forma que se siguen las mejores oportunidades para obtener o establecer una jurisprudencia que les favorezca. Los usuarios intensivos de la administración de justicia pueden transaccionar o pagar aquellos asuntos que no desean que lleguen más allá de la primera instancia, de forma que resuelvan que podrían perjudicarles jamás alcancen ni siquiera el rango de «jurisprudencia menor». Los usuarios intensivos de la administración de justicia, además, complementan toda su estrategia anterior con una eficaz y constante labor de «lobby» ante gobiernos y partidos de la oposición y con el uso de medios de comunicación que ellos financian con su publicidad, para establecer premisas mayores —luego les pondré un curioso ejemplo— que más tarde aprovecharán para construir silogimos tan falaces como aparentemente irrefutables. Los usuarios intensivos de la administración de justicia incluso recurren a la financiación de grupos y actividades parajudiciales (congresos o jornadas para peritos, abogados u otros juristas, etc.) con lo que acaban de redondear una maquinaria que funciona como un mecanismo de relojería perfectamente engrasado . Todo sea por el beneficio (el suyo). para establecer premisas mayores —luego les pondré un curioso ejemplo— que más tarde aprovecharán para construir silogimos tan falaces como aparentemente irrefutables.

Todo sea por el beneficio (el suyo). ) con lo que acaban de redondear una maquinaria que funciona como un mecanismo de relojería perfectamente engrasado. Todo sea por el beneficio (el suyo).\n\nAdemás, en la cultura política contemporánea, la ley es tan omnipresente que ha llegado a dominar la forma en que la gente común piensa sobre sus problemas y las decisiones que toman sobre la resolución de esos problemas en su vida cotidiana. De esta manera, la ley preserva los privilegios de los usuarios intensivos de la administración de justicia, no solo a través de decisiones judiciales, sino también a través de las creencias y prácticas de la gente común (Ewick & Silbey 1998, Silbey 2005).\n\nSin embargo, a pesar de lo dicho hasta ahora y de la refractariedad de los ciudadanos comunes a acudir a la justicia e incluso de la inclinación natural de sus abogados a tratar de evitar el conflicto jurídico por todos los medios, resulta evidente que a los individuos , a menudo, no les queda otro remedio que acudir a los juzgados y tribunales para defender lo que consideran legítimamente su derecho y es ahí donde la ley y las categorías legales tienen una potencialidad verdaderamente admirable para motivar a la gente a movilizarse y resistir contra determinados injusticias y es ahí donde —a veces, algunas veces— los tribunales de justicia se encuentran en el campo de batalla donde se juega el mantenimiento de un determinado status quo o el progreso y el cambio social.\n\nLos abogados y abogadas, dentro del panorama descrito, son poderosos guardianes de las instituciones políticas y legales donde la dinámica entre la ley y el cambio social tiene lugar (Galanter 1974, Hunt 1990, Silbey 2005) y, si me lo permiten, déjenme que les ponga algunos ejemplos.\n\nCuando en 2012 el ministro de justicia de infausto recuerdo Alberto Ruíz Gallardón estableció unas infames tasas judiciales para poder acceder a la administración de justicia, se cuidó mucho de que las tasas que gravaban el acceso a los recursos fuesen las más elevadas. Esto no era casual, era la forma de colocar más lejos del ciudadano común las instancias donde se fija la jurisprudencia y era la forma de permitir a los poderosos seleccionar los procesos más convenientes para llevar a cabo un cabo ante ellos. De paso se nos dijo que los ciudadanos españoles éramos muy querulantes y que para evitar las altas tasas de litigiososad de los españoles lo mejor era establecer unas tasas que se destinarían a justicia gratuita.\n\nComo sospecho que ustedes saben bien, todo era un inmenso cúmulo de mentiras: los ciudadanos españoles no son usuarios intensivos de la administración de justicia, quienes lo son, son exactamente bancos, entidades financieras, aseguradoras y en general los poderosos que han hecho de la administración de justicia su particular oficina de cobros o la trinchera donde defender sus desvergonzados incumplimientos; tampoco era cierto que lo recaudado en tasas fue financiar la justicia como gratuita —con incalificable desvergüenza— se atrevió a escribir en el propio texto de la ley y la única verdad fue que los poderosos pudieron felicitarse al ver aumentadas sus herramientas y posibilidades de control.\n\nFue con la infamia de las tasas cuando apareció con fuerza en España una abogacía rebelde, bien que con causa, que no estuvo dispuesta a aceptar como inevitable aquella iniquidad. Una abogacía que usó de las mismas herramientas de los poderosos, que ya no litigaba por el caso concreto sino en el marco de una estrategia procesal mucho más amplia: se buscaban denodadamente casos “perfectos” que poder llevar ante los tribunales españoles y europeos a la busca de unas resoluciones que pusiesen fin a la infamia de las tasas. Ya no se litigaba por el resultado de un solo caso sino por una jurisprudencia que acabase con una situación inaceptable.\n\nEsta abogacía no era —no es— una abogacía de causas perdidas sino una abogacía de futuro, que ya no busca ganar un caso concreto sino que trabaja para ganar una causa colectiva, ya sea esta una ampliación de derechos fundamentales, la derogación de una ley injusta o el remedio de lamentables situaciones de hecho.\n\nVeo este tipo de abogacía en muchas acciones de los abogados de extranjería, laboralistas, de consumidores, partidarios del conocimiento y el software libres… una dimensión ética empieza a generalizarse —siempre ha estado ahí, bien que menos visible— en la abogacía buscando con tal dimensión, abogados y abogadas, separarse de la imagen de la mera voz mercenaria o del profesional absolutamente neutral.\n\nDesde los viejos abogados laboralistas que —durante la transición— trabajaron (ya veces murieron) defendiendo una causa y un cambio necesario, hasta los modernos abogados tecnológicos que persiguen una determinada concepción del mundo y la sociedad, la abogacía ha sido siempre un importante agente de cambio y progreso social capaz de forzar avances tan necesarios como necesarios, por eso no es extraño que moleste a quienes desearían perpetuar su posición de dominio.\n\nEs quizá tiempo de que abogados y abogadas tomen conciencia de su inmenso potencial como agente de cambio y busquen la manera de organizar y optimizar su trabajo, no sólo en el interés de sus clientes, sino de toda la sociedad.\n\n¿Qué tal si lo hacemos juntos?", "timestamp": 1633771809, "digest": "0dMVt94Ul6g7ngRWSTQ25wmrIQP58Kr-XNNA0lUrQRU", "contributor": "0xb5bF77b790f8185a6968F0B26f7Ff2610c1aAe42"}

Nuestros políticos, absolutamente ajenos a ningún criterio que no sea el estrictamente económico, han regulado nuestra actividad cual si de un simple negocio se tratase y, al olvidar toda consideración distinta de la económica, han cometido un error que puede acabar con nuestra profesión para alborozo de los llamados «grandes despachos» y las también llamadas «grandes corporaciones». Veámoslo.\n\nEmpecemos por el principio de los principios, a saber: el ejercicio de la abogacia tiene como objetivo primero y primordial la defensa de los derechos ajenos.\n\nQue la defensa de los derechos ajenos sea el primer objetivo de la abogacía supone, ya desde el principio, que una visión puramente empresarial del ejercicio profesional de la profesión o una orientación corporativa al beneficio económico es absolutamente incompatible con nuestra forma de entender la profesión.\n\nLa segunda consecuencia del principio enunciado es que, las leyes que traten de regular la abogacía, lo primero que habrán de tener en cuenta es la naturaleza no puramente empresarial de ese servicio al que llamamos abogacía.\n\nSi el primer objetivo de las firmas de abogados va a ser obtener dividendos y la primera medida de su éxito va a ser cuantificar beneficios económicos, no duden que esta profesión pronto desaparecerá suplantada por una legión de mercaderes, intermediarios o, en el peor de los casos, delincuentes.\n\nTres cosas, nos enseñó Cicerón, que pagaban al abogado antes que el dinero: la admiración del público, el agradecimiento del cliente y la esperanza del resto de los agraviados en que podría haber justicia en su causa. Es cierto que ninguna de ellas alimenta mucho, pero, si la esperanza de quienes sufren injusticias va a descansar sobre unas firmas cuyo primer objetivo es ganar dinero, podemos ir despidiéndonos de la posibilidad de tener siquiera una ficción de estado de derecho.\n\nYa lo estamos viendo: firmas que ofrecen asesoramiento jurídico con amplia publicidad en medios de comunicación cual si tuvieran despachos en toda España y que lo que hacen es desviar los clientes que llaman para luego, compartir los honorarios del abogado porque ellos le han facilitado el cliente. Antes, al menos, estos zurupetos se ocultaban, ahora, convertidos en corporaciones, se exhiben a través de una publicidad insidiosa, para lucrarse con el trabajo de unos abogados acuciados por la crisis.\n\nAyer se veía en la televisión cómo empresas de internet ofrecían servicios jurídicos a precios inverosímilmente bajos o cobraban a los abogados unas cantidades nada despreciables con la promesa de hacerles llegar clientes que, luego, en multitud de casos no llegaban.\n\nSi creemos que el beneficio económico es el primer objetivo de ¿«la abogacía»? este panorama que les acabo de contar es perfecto. Pero, si lo que creemos es que el primer objetivo de la abogacía es defender derechos ajenos y la esperanza de todos, este paisaje que les he descrito es simplemente el principio del fin.\n\nYa conocemos cómo se las gasta la industria del software subcontratando ingenieros a precio de salario de subsistencia. «Cárnicas» llaman los programadores a esas empresas que no parecen tratar con personas sino traficar con carne. Ya sabemos lo que ha ocurrido en el campo, por ejemplo, de las clínicas dentales o de las estéticas.\n\nEn el caso de la abogacía esta dependencia de corporaciones que subcontratan al profesional es muchísimo peor, pues la independencia es al abogado lo que la imparcialidad es al juez. Un abogado ha de servir al cliente y no a la cuenta de resultados de la empresa o despacho que le da el trabajo. ¿Alguien cree que toda la reacción que la abogacía independiente y humilde ha puesto en marcha contra las odiosas condiciones del mercado hipotecario la podría haber puesto en marcha despachos entre cuyos clientes se cuentan los principales bancos de España?\n\nNo se engañen: si lo que queremos es becarios que defiendan los derechos de la ciudadanía para que los intermediarios o los comerciantes ganen dinero vamos en la dirección correcta; pero, si lo que deseamos es una abogacía que, como hasta ahora, sea independiente, sirva a los ciudadanos, les defienda frente a los poderosos y mantener la esperanza de todos de que la justicia aún es posible en España, estas leyes puramente económicas son la muerte de todo cuanto amamos.\n\nQuieren una abogacía dócil, con una planta judicial pequeña para no tener que abrir demasiados despachos ni tener que contratar demasiados abogados, sin restricciones publicitarias para poder traficar con el trabajo de los abogados y con una libertad de pacto absoluta en cuanto a honorarios para convertir a los profesionales de la abogacía en falsos autónomos pagados a precio de carne industrial.\n\nAhora, reflexiona un momento y dime si lo que quieres es eso porque, si no quieres eso, tendrás que levantarte y convencer a todos nuestros políticos de que tú no ejerces una profesión cuyo primer o único objetivo es ganar y que, por lo mismo , no puede ser regulada como si fuera una actividad puramente mercantil.", "timestamp": 1633772380, "digest": "OMXHmyfxScGWe7QwPGcPe1vv032WgPSA2jPJnJ68ec0", "contributor": "0xb5bF77b790f8185a6968F0B26f7Ff2610c1aAe42"}

{"id": "k6LEY8KQzub4i1VjV6ZLxnHAUFU8NhhOERJihrxg0V8", "title": "Ser abogado no es negocio", "body": "Me dirijo a ti, joven estudiante de derecho o del máster de acceso a la abogacía porque quiero que, antes de que sea tarde, sepas una cosa que debo decirte: ser abogado no es negocio.\n\nSi estás estudiando derecho o el máster de acceso porque tu familia o amigos te han dicho que siendo abogado ganarás dinero olvídalo, te están engañando. Si ganar dinero con el ejercicio profesional es tu objetivo vital yo te diría que cambies inmediatamente de idea, la de abogado no es la profesión que buscas.\n\nSeguro que has oído hablar de Calamandrei. Piero Calamandrei, además de ser un autor que aparece en tus apuntes de procesal, era un tipo que los tenía muy bien puestos. Era abogado ya en 1912 pero cuando llegó la primera guerra mundial (1914-1918) se alistó voluntario en el 218° de Infantería y concluyó la guerra con el grado de teniente coronel. Cuando llegó a Italia el fascismo Piero ya era catedrático, pero no dudó en jugarse su puesto y su libertad firmando manifiestos contra Mussolini, escribiendo en publicaciones valientemente antifascistas como *Non mollare* (No te rindas) y participando en la resistencia contra el régimen con riesgo de su libertad y su vida.\n\nPues bien, este tipo —que como ves no solo estudiaba derecho procesal— lo explicó muy gráficamente:\n\n> No me hables de riqueza, tu sabes que, el verdadero abogado, el que dedica toda su vida al patrocinio, muere pobre; ricos se hacen solamente aquellos que, bajo el título de abogados, son en realidad comerciantes o intermediarios…\n\nSí, joven amigo, el verdadero abogado si no muere pobre, al menos, no muere inmensamente rico. Y esto es así porque ser abogado no es —no puede ser— simplemente un negocio. Si para ti ganar dinero tiene más prioridad que defender los derechos de tu cliente, antes defenderás tu dinero que su causa y serás un buen comerciante, pero no serás abogado, serás otra cosa.\n\nQue no te engañen con la prensa salmón y las páginas de economía de los periódicos: esos despachos que se dicen «grandes» y que miden su éxito en dinero sólo son ¿grandes? en su cuenta de resultados, aunque tú, desde hoy, sabes que, para un abogado de verdad, ellos sólo son un negocio.\n\nEs importante que recuerdes esto que te digo, joven compañero, porque desde el gobierno, desde los medios de comunicación e incluso desde la propia abogacía institucional, te hablarán en términos económicos cuando hablen de la profesión.\n\nDesde el gobierno te hablarán de desregulación, de ampliar la competencia, de libertad de precios y bajadas de tarifas y honorarios. Los gobiernos y sus comisiones de defensa de la competencia no distinguen un abogado de una distribuidora de chicles o de una peluquería; para los gobiernos y sus comisiones de defensa de la competencia lo importante no es que todos los españoles sean iguales ante la ley y dispongan de una asistencia letrada suficiente; lo importante es que los honorarios bajen; ya luego, si se puede llevar decentemente un divorcio por 150€ o un asesinato por 300€, no es cosa que parezca importarles.\n\nA la prensa económica y los medios de comunicación sólo les preocupa la facturación. Tanto ganas tanto vales. Medir en dinero es fácil, ellos son economistas y de eso entienden, pero ¿cómo se mide la justicia?\n\nCuando Dionisio Moreno —un abogado humilde— propuso plantear una cuestión prejudicial al TJUE en el caso Aziz y el juez del caso, efectivamente, la planteó, Dionisio no pudo cobrar nada a su cliente pobre de solemnidad; sin embargo la sentencia del caso Aziz —la de las hipotecas— permitió que centenares de miles de españoles pudiesen reclamar a los bancos el dinero que estos, injustamente, les habían depredado durante años. La cuenta de resultados de Dionisio y del Juez que planteó la cuestión prejudicial no subieron un céntimo, ahora bien ¿tú dirías que esos dos juristas son peores que algún gran despacho que factura infinitamente más pero que se ve salpicado directamente por un caso de fraude fiscal?\n\nNo, ser abogado no es negocio, es profesión, es vocación; se es abogado, no «se trabaja» de abogado, porque ser abogado es, simplemente, una forma de vida.\n\nTratarán de convencerte de que no escuches a la gente que piensa como yo, que asumas que lo moderno es entender la profesión como un negocio, que lo guay es decir muchas palabras en inglés del tipo, *junior*, *senior*, *of counsel*, *networking* y hasta a tomarse un café le llamarán *coffee break*. No les hagas caso, toda esa parafernalia no es moderna, el uso innecesario del inglés es un marcador de pobreza léxica (recuerda que «letrado» viene de letras) y no obedece más que a una copia acrítica de discursos ajenos. Son malas copias de malos originales.\n\nY sí, gobiernos y empresas te mandarán el mensaje de que entender la abogacía al estilo de Calamandrei es algo anticuado, la abogacía institucional afianzará tal mensaje con congresos «moelnos» donde los problemas de esa abogacía de que te hablo —el 85% de los abogados de España— serán cuidadosamente silenciados.\n\nQue no te engañen estos tampoco. En la república de los abogados el último de ellos no es ni más ni menos que el primero: abogado. Cada uno de los abogados y abogadas que forman esta república no sólo no son inferiores en nada a quienes la dirigen sino que, en su concreto campo de especialización, probablemente están mejor formados que quienes les gobiernan. No eres, no serás, ni más ni menos que ninguno de tus compañeros y por eso, si ves que algunos de ellos mantienen sus reuniones y acuerdos en secreto, que buscan la forma de impedir o dificultar tu participación, si ves que hablan en tu nombre sin haberte preguntado, si ves que ocultan minuciosamente el importe de las dietas que tú les pagas, entonces sabrás que no defienden la abogacía de que te hablo sino otra bien distinta. No te achiques, tú sabes quién eres y quién puedes llegar a ser y su oscurantismo es sólo una medida de su miedo.\n\nAsí pues, jóvenes y futuros compañeros y compañeras, debéis saber dónde venís y a qué venís. Probablemente con esta profesión no os hagáis ricos pero habéis de saber que, si a pesar de todo elegís serlo, a vosotros os corresponderá defender las esperanzas de justicia de los ciudadanos y la posibilidad de que este país tenga futuro.

2021-07-16 15.10.40.png)\n\n公司发现，可以利用一些好的线路实现a、c三点之间的通信，而公司可能会在c的线路上，可能在节点安装b**电话**，当a和b时，来自电源c的呼叫，突发事件a和，当a和b的录音结束后，交流电和a。公司以b线路的成本18元，产生3倍也就是30元的收入，如果忽然忽然的长大，收益为30—18＝ 12元。那么，当节点数从2增加到3，也增加了50％，产品和成品分别达到了3倍和12倍！\n\n这就是网络的魅力，因此实际上就是边边收益增加（收入的增加的多远成本的增加）。尽管电话线路是有成本的，比线路到小线路要小，也可以扩展到最终利润的目标的结果。\n\n我们继续，电话公司再架设一条从c到d的线路，三条线可以使6对客户通话，即ab、ac、ad、bc、bd、cd（见图2实线），公司的收入增长（60 —30）／30＝100％，而成本只增加了（27—18）／18＝50％，边际增长的特征就是**增长得比成本快得多**。\n\n!\\[\\]( <https://secure.wostatic.cn/static/tnZt1c9gJqYSPGQwNRcyed/Screenshot> -

2021-07-16 15.25.06.png)\n\n2015 年，中国科学院的情报研究人员对 Facebook 和腾讯的实际进行了了，证明梅卡夫技术是分析的，社交平台公司的市场价值与网络节点的平方成比。\n\n在运用梅特卡夫公式时特别需要注意的另一点是，用户数的增加并不自动增加公司的价值，V仅给出一个网络的理论或潜在价值，而不是市场上的实际价值。**网络的市场价值用户的互动方式、互动产生的交易，以及从互联网公司互动和交易中获得的收益，例如广告、中介或引入其他商业广告、视频**圈**之间的交易收入**。在投资互联网圈里，各种动态的在线用户数和用户数的增加，最终确定的价值是用户的互动方式以及互联网公司的商业模式。\n\n如果只关注用户而却商业模式，创业公司往往“赔本赚吆喝”。轮又融资的外部就持续，融资终止，公司断了。\n\n路线图1为路线，我们不必修筑点到一点的直接线路将货物搬运到c，将货物从abc，运到c，需要增加b点上扳道岔路口的设备和工人，将火车从ab导入bc段，或者在上面有车从c点出发的时间，防止出现撞车事故。\n\n铁路上的岔路口对应电话网络中的智能，与电话网络不同，必须被火车租赁需要时间，当ab线占用时间，从火车到火车不能通过，在某地等候车，而从火车到b的电话信号可即时到达，只要a和b挂上1个电话，c就可以和a或者b通话。\n\n铁路交通需要时间，特点弱化了铁路的梅特卡夫，虽然增加了铁路，但基础上的卫星一样的：铁路的商业建设比线路建设成本高得快，铁路的边路也增加了。\n\n通信网络的特点在于a和c的不影响或很少影响其他节点，使用智能设备实现了许多用户之间的电话信号在一条线上的同时传输，而互联网甚至不连网使用，不连接它的梅特卡夫效率最强。\n\n## 2、双边市场效应\n\n不是所有的互联网公司优质梅特卡夫效应，这个组织的产生于节点间的互动，某一类网络，可能只是在不同类别的用户之间的互动，例如淘宝上的互动和交易仅在供应商商和消费者之间进行，供应商和供应商之间基本没有互动，消费者和消费者也没有交易的可能。\n\n互联网平台的价值主要供应方和需求方的相互吸引和支持，我们结缘市场效应。\n\n定义世界市场效应为：**不同类型的用户参与互动所创造的价值**。\n\n关注“**不同类型用户**”的限定，这些同类用户没有互动，因此市场效应因此弱于梅特卡夫之间。\n\n滴滴等网车平台具有良好的市场效应，打车的需求，司机的预期目标，会有更多的司机加入网约车的行列，司机和车辆多，打车更方便，并且随着速度的增加，价格会越来越低，因此会吸引更多的消费者。\n\n世界末日市场效应和梅特夫平台效应是重要的，在市场中，在市场中，不是孩子能产生交互。在大多数情况下，用户是没有交互的，类似3，约3，约b1和b2没有交互的，打车人c1和c2彼此也互不认识。4个节点只有4对可能的交互，即b1c1、b1c2、b2c1、b2c2，我们可以很清楚地从网络结构以及重要的交互剧情梅特夫和沿用市场效应的电影。\n\n!\\[\\]( <https://secure.wostatic.cn/static/nB14DQEKQSBt4iyD67N2L2/Screenshot> - 2021-07-16 15.41.07.png)\n\n在互联网的商业模式中，用户分集合类是常见的现象，如淘宝平台上有买家和卖家，平台上的房东和租客，美团外卖分为餐馆和消费者，知社区上的写手和读者，滴滴平台上的司机和乘客，滴滴约会网站上的女士和男性（虽然不排除同性约会，但同性或双性恋是她）\n\n用户不分类是社交平台，对于同样的用户数，社交平台的理论价值也从边缘市场。如果有 1 个消费者所有 m 个供应商购买产品，也就是有 m 个交易，2 个消费者就存在m *2个交易的可能，n个消费者和m个供应商可能的交易有*n个交易，如果平台可以对每个人的笔交易收取委托，则平台的收入或价值可表达为\n\n$$      **V=k *m* n**      $$\n\n式中，k是一个常数，m是供应商数量，n是消费者群体，V是市场平台的理论或潜在价值。\n\n准确地讲，节点总数比n+m，只是供应量mn和n比一般情况下，mn，例如淘因网上商城2000万有和亿用户动态。\n\n和梅特卡夫一样，市场效果也不是互联网所特有的，甚至不是网络所特有的。实际上，任何一个市场如浙江乌小商品市场是一个典型的市场。良性循环说，义乌和滴滴本质没有的，确实有一些可能的现实，而在互联网空间中可能是无限的可能。\n\n所以我们说梅特卡夫效率比二次市场效果高一维或高一阶。\n\n投资者青睐互联网公司，原因是在梅特卡夫下的利润增长，传统行业规模最大的公司，投资者也有这样的诱人目的。公司未来什么成果，他们看重的是用户数量、流量，公司是否能够迅速扩大规模，超过投资点，实现的超额回报。\n\n不看当前赢利的投资者经常被说成是炒作互联网概念，实际上，他们身边的人在做逻辑计算，只是工业时代的人看不懂的道理。\n\n## 3、电商平台（京东或亚马逊模式的直营电商）\n\n有点平台，直营电商可能不具备任何梅特卡夫效应，也不具备任何市场优势。\n\n电商是传说中的应用互联网技术的一个行业，那里的商户是早期的亚马逊或京东本地的线上零售商（在他们网上淘宝销售），而不是线上淘宝、天猫这样的线上交易平台。从厂家购买商品，再卖给消费者。消费者除了在网上查看商品，不会和打交道，他们下供应商给亚马逊，从亚马逊购买商品。\n\n图5中的直营电商P居中从2个供应商采购，卖给3个消费者，这些交易中获得的收益构成电商的收入和网络的价值来源。\n\n!\\[\\]( [https://secure.wostatic.cn/static/6kHvtYSJcguitHNKTPEf3p/Scr​​ eenshot](https://secure.wostatic.cn/static/6kHvtYSJcguitHNKTPEf3p/Screenshot) -

2021-07-20 15.29.12.png)\n\n在这个坊这个价值网络中发现的商业模式基本都可以以太为这种模型模型，\n\n也就是美味\n\n$$ V=k\\*(n+m) $$\n\n或者右边这个\n\n$$ V=k *m* n $$\n\n两个网络效应的卫星是响应式的，认真思考下来，我定义了特定的网络效应，更清晰地看到了各种形式的市场网络效应。\n\n因为项目有很多资金池，各种网络池目前并不能自由流通，但是有很多资金池内部，确实存在自由交易的，是利用市场网络效率用户的。\n\n**当前所有项目的商业模式和金融都一样，就是现场直播，用大量的收银收视巨额的贵宾。**\n\n**本质上是因为当年互联网上是信息，钱还差一步传输，无法直接支付用户的钱，再加上互联网的各种网络推广，衍生用学免费吸引用户，然后通过其他商业行为赚到收入的模式；**\n\n**网络价值不一样表面上直接流通的钱，项目方不必舍近乎远方寻找其他收入，直接收取真正是路径行为也是最符合逻辑的商业模式，点是传统金融和数字金融的共性。**\n\n## 6、DEX在商业模式上的优势\n\n互联网是网络，交换信息是刚好，交换信息是刚好，交换信息是刚需要，我们看到的交换信息中的，也是需要早期信息的即时软件通信，如图片和视频社交在早期的基础设施不考虑的情况下就无法实现），在此更多腾讯明星拥有十亿个用户的社交平台，我们可以简单的社交平台以下几个特征：\n\n* **刚需（基本可以默认通用都是微信用户）**\n* **高频（高频信息的交流是高频需求，打开手机就可以看到微信的使用时间长大了）**\n* **最强的梅特卡夫网络效应可以带来最大的相关成本（你的所有亲友关系都在微里，你成为微信用户，对微信，筑获取的成本相关，用户有排他性，所以我们社交社交平台连老二都没有生存空间）**\n\n那个已经有一个链这个价值网络，交换价值确实是刚需，我们来这个网络中就是为了不停地交换代币达到增值收益的目的，然后在以太坊的网络中，DEX就是刚需高频的需求，作为不使用笑机服务，可以不去交流性枪池，可以不参与交流性枪池功能，但是大我中心化交流提供哭泣的用户交换去。\n\n* **刚需（基本可以默认通用都是 DEX 的用户）**\n* **高频（价值的交换是高频需求，这点从当前确定的项目中的 DEX 的总交易额和交易频率可能寻求）**\n* **AMM（我认为AMM是DEX特别说话等其他商业形态的独特？）**\n\n#### 7、AMM：Automated Market Maker（自动做市商）\n\n是链世界独有的创新也是DEX的特色。\n\n链下的传统金融世界，忽然性能和成本，所以订单簿是最符合逻辑和最真实的交易方式；\n\n但链上的数字金融，早在公链的预言和计算量，订单簿是无法实现的，我记得体验世界体验也是缓慢卡顿人们分分钟想的。\n\n奇迹的AMM机制应运而生，用这种方式构建了流量流动性，也带来了一段链世界中独特的交易方式。\n\nDEX和话等defi项目一样，商业模式上是没有多少网络可以影响的，DEX特权的AMM机制，是为DEX带来的不一样的竞争优势的。\n\n我们看Unwap的十大吸引，因为MM机制，这些在智能说明上就是上面的资金池**固有**了**辅助市场效应。**\n\n!\\[\\]( <https://secure.wostatic.cn/static/68wAWLzsCuUXa6J5inezH7/Screenshot> - 2021-07-20 16.36.02.png)\n\n某个资金池的LP提供者，比如当我们完成交易质把ETH-USDC完成交易质押做市，我们在做市这个商角色，之后的价格变动带来交易的需求，LP提供者一直是买者和卖的比赛方，交易者买入时，LP提供卖盘的流动性，交易者卖时，LP提供买盘的流动性。\n\n所以资金池内部的节点数越多，越会产生的增量资金，也就是越来越多的流动性，专门点的流动性带来越低的滑坡，资本的消耗也提高了市场，可以减少了，增加了能力），增加的必然又会带来更多的交易者交易者越多，会搏斗，LP提供者可以享受做市商机会费去也越多，也增加了LP提供者来做市，从而带来更多的流动性和电影点。\n\n那我们可不认为，在意识中某个特定的交易对内部，是有市场整个效率的，随着节点的增多，小网络是达到了提高资本的目标。\n\n$$ V=k *m* n $$\n\n我们认为，因为DEX相对其他定义项目拥有的刚需、高频和AMM特征，给了DEX的商业，让DEX模式用户可视化了最高的TVL，实现了最高的细节，拥有者的最高数据……\n\n!\\[\\]( <https://secure.wostatic.cn/static/b3JbSsiPmLdtPgytyCdFpE/Screenshot> -

Este sistema fue inicialmente lanzado en el blockchain por Uniswap en la red Ethereum, sin embargo los elevadísimos costes de uso de esta red hace necesario que los usuarios domésticos migren a otras redes mas económicas y menos congestionadas como la KCC.\n\nAsí en un AMM como es MojitoSwap los usuarios pueden obtener rendimientos convirtiéndose en un proveedores de liquidez. Al agregar sus activos al fondo de liquidez, pueden aportar tokens LP (un token compuesto por dos tokens a partes iguales en proporción valor) o su token nativo MJT para ganar recompensas.\n\nEl token MojitoSwap MJT es un token KRC20; esto es que corre en la red KCC (un token ERC20 correría en la red Ethereum) y la función principal de MJT es incentivar la provisión de liquidez a la plataforma MojitoSwap a través de programas de minería de liquidez, prestamos etc. Ademas este token MJT conformará el voto de los usuarios partícipes en la MojitoDao cuando se lance.\n\nLos usuarios proveedores de liquidez reciben como recompensa tokens MJT que a su vez pueden aportar al protocolo y bloquearlos en el mismo para así obtener más. De esta manera el TVL (valor total de los activos bloqueados en el protocolo) del protocolo se ve incrementado, atrayendo a más usuarios.\n\nPosteriormente añadirán más funcionalidades como sorteos y la DAO.\n\nNombre del token: Mojito Token\n\nAbreviatura: MJT\n\nDirección del contrato: 0x2cA48b4eeA5A731c2B54e7C3944DBDB87c0CFB6F\n\nSuministro:100,000,000\n\nBlockchain: KCC (cadena comunitaria Kucoin)\n\nMecanismo de obtención: airdrops, minería de liquidez, sorteos…\n\nDistribución de tokens\n\nAirdrops -1% (1,000,000)\n\nMinería de liquidez -75% (75.000.000)\n\nCoste de comercialización -4% (4.000.000)\n\nCoste de marca -4% (4.000.000)\n\nPropiedad del equipo (desbloqueo promedio lineal en los próximos 4 años.)-6% (6.000.000)\n\nLaboratorios (Asignados por votación DAO) -10% (10.000.000)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*dGNyaTFzBdZYLuBk-5SDfw.png)\n\nDistribución tokens\n\n## ¡AIRDROP!\n\n¡Camarero más mojitos🍹!\n\nMojitoSwap ademas está en pleno airdrop de su token MJT a todos aquellos usuarios que hayan realizado transacciones en la KCC.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*nxUvCBs2bdeGp0DoC_F5tg.png)\n\nMojitoSwap airdrop\n\nReglas del airdrop:\n\nFicha: MJT\n\nPeríodo: disponible para reclamar a partir de ahora 9 de octubre de 2021 con un límite de 6 meses\n\nCantidad total: 500.000\n\nRequisito: Los usuarios que hayan realizado al menos 10 transacciones antes del bloque 2.080.000 en KCC podrán reclamar el token\n\nFranjas de reclamación del airdrop:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*rcHw6t7wQpggNwLgMj3qFQ.png)\n\nRecompensas por transacciones en la cadena\n\nPara reclamar tus tokens accede al protocolo, conecta tu cartera y reclama tus tokens :\n\n![Airdrop de mojitos](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*MjuSk7HcM-BLCnAQsH2MGA.png)\n\nY ya está, esperemos consigas todos los🍹mojitos que tu cuerpo aguante 🐄\n\n**Enlaces de MojitoSwap y redes sociales**\n\nweb3/Dapp: [https://www.MojitoSwap.Finance](https://www.mojitoswap.finance/)\n\nTwitter: <https://twitter.com/MojitoSwap>\n\nMedium: <https://medium.com/@mojitoswap>\n\nTelegram: <https://t.me/MojitoFinance>\n\n**Enlaces de KuCoin Community Chain y redes sociales**\n\nWeb: <https://www.kcc.io/>\n\nDocumentación: <https://docs.kcc.io/>\n\nExplorer: <https://explorer.kcc.io/>\n\n**Redes sociales**\n\nDiscord: <https://discord.gg/H5ucJydSyd>\n\nTwitter: <https://twitter.com/KCCOfficialTW>\n\nTelegram español: <https://t.me/KucoinSpanish>\n\nTelegram Channel: <https://t.me/KCCOfficialChannel>\n\nMedium: <https://kccofficial.medium.com/>", "timestamp": 1633776868, "digest": "GclrgPL2F5tq-idErGzVJKWcWnqSp2fRb8Xh-t-98c0", "contributor": "0x0fB213a1Af101b1429e6aD3020ad92Fb0D25Eb1E"}

Por suerte al ser KCC una cadena de bloques compatible con Ethereum es posible recuperar tus activos en pocos pasos.\n\nNo obstante hay ciertas variables que debes valorar. Primero determinar el tipo de billetera en la que se depositó el dinero. Si es una billetera sin custodia donde conoces la frase semilla o las claves privadas de la billetera, no vas a tener problema en recuperarlo. Sin embargo, si lo envías a una cuenta custodiada por un exchange o casa de cambio tendrás que ponerte en contacto con su servicio técnico.\n\nEn cambio si eres custodio de tu cuenta, y has enviado tus tokens a una cuenta basada en EVM, tan solo necesitas configurar tu cartera para acceder a tus activos.\n\nContinúe con los pasos a continuación ….\n\nLo primero es instalar en tu navegador la extensión de una cartera como [metamask](https://metamask.io/) el cual es compatible con la red KCC.\n\nEn el mismo metamask, introduce la billetera con la frase de recuperación o semilla de tu cuenta. A continuación agrega la red KCC:\n\n* En Configuración de Metamask -> Redes -> Agregar y complete los siguientes parámetros:\n* Nombre de la cadena: KCC-MAINNET\n* ID de cadena: 321\n* Símbolo: KCS\n* URL de RPC: [https://rpc-mainnet.kcc.network](https://rpc-mainnet.kcc.network/)\n* URL del explorador: [https://explorer.kcc.io/](https://explorer.kcc.io/en)\n\nPor ultimo debes agregar el contrato del token que enviaste.\n\nPara obtener una lista de todos los contratos de token vinculados en KCC, haga clic [AQUÍ](https://github.com/kcc-community/kcc-peg-token#mainnet).\n\nHay que tener en cuenta que a que menos importes a metamask los contratos de los tokens que has enviado, no los veras reflejados en tu cartera.\n\nPensamientos finales\n\nEs siempre recomendable, que hagas un envío de pequeña cantidad para comprobar que estas enviando tus tokens correctamente a la dirección correcta en la red que corresponde. Una vez lo compruebes envia el resto. Es mejor pagar un poco mas de tasas que perder tus fondos.\n\nRecuerda ❗NUNCA compartas la frase semilla de tu billetera con nadie ❗️\n\n**Enlaces de KuCoin Community Chain y redes sociales**\n\nWeb: <https://www.kcc.io/>\n\nDocumentación: <https://docs.kcc.io/>\n\nExplorer: <https://explorer.kcc.io/>\n\n**Redes sociales**\n\nDiscord: <https://discord.gg/H5ucJydSyd>\n\nTwitter: <https://twitter.com/KCCOfficialTW>\n\nTelegram español: <https://t.me/KucoinSpanish>\n\nTelegram Channel: <https://t.me/KCCOfficialChannel>\n\nMedium: <https://kccofficial.medium.com/>", "timestamp": 1633777103, "digest": "kxwO14e_A84QnenoIcgNAyADhWITp_Y-8Srwa8PyUDA", "contributor": "0x0fB213a1Af101b1429e6aD3020ad92Fb0D25Eb1E"}

But I am scared we might be magicians.*\n>\n> — “Devs” Season 1, Episode 4\n\nLike any good mage, Forest, the charismatic founder of Amaya, wields the term “scared” here less out of simple fear, and more in the guise of single-minded anticipation, the finely-balanced dread mixed with a longing that colors the face of a doctor, archaeologist or explorer about to knowingly transgress the boundaries of the natural order and reanimate the dead, read from the forbidden spellbook or open a tomb lined with treasure. His is a recognition of certain moral exceptionalism, the realization that he and his team are going somewhere no one has gone before. There also seems to be a tacit understanding that this comes with inevitable penalties — but it’s a price worth paying.\n\nThis exchange in Alex Garland’s breakout series *[Devs](https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/devs)* is the first concrete signifier of the tension which sits at the heart of this spare, brainy, and deeply atmospheric drama. The story Garland is telling seems to be just another statement about Big Tech, complete with the glossy wrapper of overhead drone shots, golden lens flares, affectless tech prodigies, and an eclectic, yet devotional [soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0XqfCYjdqWhZhjy66ZrFHl?si=pWUWrT2XRZmW1InYMDRUZQ).\n\nAs posited by the [Copenhagen Interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation) of quantum computing, when measured differently, Devs could be something else entirely. Intentional or not (and I have to believe it is) what Garland has created is a work of [folk horror](https://www.ritesofspring.co.uk/folk-horror), centered on Silicon Valley — the place and the mindset. While it’s not an end-to-end set piece in the full genre tradition, the core of *Devs* is full of signifiers and sigils, tropes, motifs, and easter eggs, which suggest that Garland, at the very least, leans heavily on this story form as a way to shape his morality tale. Quantum computing and big data provide the dark magic, but the Valley serves up the other necessary ingredients of dangerously opaque cultures and communities, transgressive acts, and self-martyrdom with presumed punishments and rewards.\n\n![Devs/FX (2020)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*e9v_76wdseRvytuFXNjRmg.jpeg)\n\nA fixture of British cinema and TV in the 1960s and 70s, films like Michael Reeves’ *[Witchfinder General](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98gzk6VSzfU)* *(1968), Piers Haggard’s [Blood On Satan’s Claw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RMySPyhMUY) (1971), and of course, Robin Hardy’s [The Wicker Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-tDnavDCwI)* (1973), established canon for this niche genre of storytelling. Folk horror has a rather long history in cinematic terms, by some accountings reaching back as far as Swedish-Danish silent film *[Häxan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYTv7mIBfdY)* *(1922), but it has enjoyed a resurgence in recent years, whole or thematically, through the work of [Peter Strickland](http://sensesofcinema.com/2019/the-analogues-of-peter-strickland/the-faraway-forest-in-peter-stricklands-katalin-varga-the-duke-of-burgundy-and-the-cobblers-lot/), director of [Katalin Varga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTjObn2W5I)* *(2009), [The Duke of Burgundy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-xIMBnclyA)* *(2015), and [In Fabric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biHUTtV4K40)* *(2019)*, Ben Wheatley’s *Kill List* *(2011) and [A Field in England](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRRvzjkzu2U)* (2013), Robert Egger’s debut *[The VVitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hba3cmYQ-e8)* *(2015), and the BBC-Netflix collaboration [Requiem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlOk23dC98Q)* (2018). Most recently, this genre has been thoroughly examined in Kier-La Janisse’s documentary *[Woodlands Dark and Days Bewitched](https://woodlandsdarkanddaysbewitched.com/)*.\n\nAri Aster has brought folk horror to new generations of American viewers through his back-to-back hits *[Hereditary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6wWKNij_1M)* (2018) about a multi-generational secret that destroys a family, and the more obvious *[Midsommar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Vnghdsjmd0)* (2019), which tells a tale of a group of twentysomething friends who travel to observe a Swedish summer ritual as a way to get away from anxiety and relationship stagnation at home, only to find something slightly more terrifying amidst the *Kinfolk*-ready pastoral purity.\n\n![Hereditary/A24 (2018)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*OAmJ2LcqVEG7NVDT)\n\nWhat defines folk horror? Critics and the few scholars who actively study it seem to agree that as a genre there are some recurring structural patterns, as well as a delineated catalog of aesthetics, icons, and imagery. Garland places enough of these throughout *Devs* to make it seem less than coincidence that folk horror is a narrative formula for the story, as well as a signpost toward its interpretation. Garland has used similar components in his rich catalog of film work, though *Devs* is the first time he has stitched together the folk horror aesthetic so distinctly and collectively.\n\nFolk horror plots don’t follow a strict structure, such as the hero’s journey, but writer and filmmaker Adam Scovell, author of “[Folk Horror: Hours Dreadful and Things Strange](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/folk-horror/9781911325222)” has proposed what he calls the “[folk horror chain](https://celluloidwickerman.com/2014/09/25/the-folk-horror-chain/),” a sequence of elements that are common to this genre: elements of **landscape**, **isolation**, **belief**, and summoning, or \\*\\*manifestation \\*\\*of the unnatural.\n\n![Annihilation/Paramount (2018)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*m2U3XYBEfJxNJ-pEci3Nyg.jpeg)\n\nSilicon Valley itself is already rich in its [own folklore](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1545&bih=885&sxsrf=ALeKk01djD3EotWpNPL2BzVNhRj2N86xYw%3A1595024814565&ei=riUSX-P-IcezsAeR-rG4CQ&q=books+about+silicon+valley+history&oq=&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQARgCMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcILhDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcILhDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnUABYAGDUO2gBcAB4AIABAIgBAJIBAJgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXqwAQo&sclient=psy-ab) — as much in its still forests and shadowy canyons, as in its military installations and university labs. The primary locus for the drama is an archetypal secluded tech campus, where the “move fast and break things” ethos, [disregard of time as a metric of human rhythms](https://www.academia.edu/8327298/Time_and_Identity_in_Folk_Horror), and deep faith in data above all governs everyone’s lives. Without much exaggeration, Garland found a community that provides, in terms of the first chain link of **location**, a setting that captures the hubris of not only an industry — tech writ large — or locale — a beautiful but decaying [San Francisco](https://www.salon.com/2019/02/20/in-the-past-year-silicon-valley-became-even-more-dystopian-unequal-report/) and [the Valley](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/silicon-valley-pescadero/531423/) — but its mental state as well.\n\nIn the opening seconds of the first episode, we see Forest standing seemingly alone in a wood after dusk, followed quickly by the contrasting hardness of San Francisco, itself a kind of “edge of the world,” geographically, culturally, economically and intellectually (even this city, in its seeming emptiness and silence, fits Scovell’s definition of “[urban wyrd](https://celluloidwickerman.com/2015/04/13/the-urban-wyrd-in-folk-horror/)”). We soon find out this Patagonia-perfect woodland is home to the sequestered, almost retreat-like campus of Amaya, Forest’s tech company, situated amid the remaining evergreen forests that dot the peninsula. Sited on the real-life campus of UC Santa Cruz, mythical Amaya sits adjacent to, but distinctly apart from the sprawling suburbs and strip malls of Silicon Valley — at the *edge* of the edge, reminiscent of Summerisle of *The* *Wicker Man*, accessible but distant enough.\n\nEven as a buzzing campus full of techies mill about with ant-like energy, Amaya is no typical corporate home. It is a kind of hushed cathedral of brutalist bulk, overshadowed by the colossus of Amaya herself — a towering statue of Forest’s dead daughter — set amongst a kind of reverential amphitheater where employees go to contemplate the infinite. The sweeping drone’s eye view gives us an overview of both Amayas, figure, and space, glinting in the golden hour (those with sharp eyes and good memories may recall the name of the desolate installation within the Shimmer in Garland’s *Annihilation*: Fort Amaya).\n\n![Devs/FX (2020)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*XCMy0Zxdv5mDvi43CKRiAw.jpeg)\n\nCinematically, this bucolic *mise en* *scène* transports us directly to a natural **isolation**, which is a perfect trope of the genre: the woods, the trees, the water, the path, the quiet, the reverential movement of people. As the second element in the chain, we see this use of remoteness in the classics of folk horror forty years prior, and it’s echoed here. As an audience, we’re immediately introduced to a principal character of the construct — nature, as both haven and hero.\n\nThe Devs facility itself is isolation-within-isolation. A kind of chapel in the woods, if a chapel had “A lead faraday shield, a thirteen-yard thick concrete shell, then a gold mesh…then an eight-yard vacuum seal, totally unbroken,” this world-within-a-world houses Devs, the unit. The structure, [one eagle-eyed Redditor recently noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Devs/comments/g551f5/the_devs_building_and_the_hebrew_tabernacle/), bears a striking similarity to the tabernacle built by the Israelites at God’s instruction, to house the Ark of the Covenant.\n\n![Devs/FX (2020)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*QHFU1FOGGG54_e-KYkYnCA.png)\n\nSymbolically, *Devs* is many things, and Garland has shoehorned a lot of arcana from various religions and mythologies into the story, but most of all, the building itself is a universe within a universe — potentially within universes — though it most importantly houses Amaya’s god-like quantum computer. The Devs team communes around it in silent contemplation, coding, and experimenting, free from the constraints of the outside world.\n\nScovell notes that this separation is key to the delta that develops between common morality, balance, or belief systems, which the protagonists are drawn into through the Devs project. “There’s little doubt that folk horror and its happenings rely on events being located outside of general society in both a physical and in a sociological way,” he writes in his 2014 thesis on the subject. If any setting in contemporary society sits apart from the economic, moral, social, and even political moorings of *our* world, it’s the world of cloud, code, and algorithm that is Big Tech.\n\nThe next link in the chain, **belief**, is central to the work of the Devs team. Forest’s quest, and by extension, Katie’s and the Devs’ mission is to use the “magic” of quantum computing to model past events. The question under consideration is to conclude whether the universe is deterministic, with a single past and future, or a multi-verse of many possible worlds. Forest holds a deterministic view because it suggests a probability of accurate reconstruction of the past and equally accurate prediction, one minute, one year, or one millennium into the future. It’s no accident that efforts to model a singular past in greater resolution suggest a symmetric model of future-gazing capabilities. The byproduct of this symmetry though is that Forest *believes* he will have the ability to look back to, and potentially experience, a high-resolution realization of his daughter Amaya, taken from him in an auto accident for which he feels responsible.\n\n![Devs/FX (2020)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*h3jedMXKC3t_FmR8JkptLQ.jpeg)\n\nThis journey toward discovering the scientific truth of the universe as understood in certain quantum models *is* Forest’s religion. It also affords him a morality trump card for the future, which absolves him from the premeditated murders (or sacrifices, *even*) of Sergei, a dev who is caught spying by Katie and Forest, and Lily’s ex-boyfriend-turned accomplice Jamie, in addition to the attempted murders of several others, and the death by suicide of another Devs team member. Determinism underpins Forest’s pursuit of self-martyrdom. His attempt to resurrect his dead daughter is aligned with the universe’s intentions, most advanced in its approach, and is therefore morally acceptable because it was always going to happen, as will anything he does to further the project. In this world, *he knows not what he does*, and yet, he does.\n\nWhen the teenaged prodigy Lyndon throws a wrench into Forest’s morality-warped deterministic belief system by injecting a multiverse-based model, the quantum computer is able to realize higher-definition versions of the past — notably by delivering the voice of Christ on the Cross as he pleads to his Father, except it’s *a Christ*, in all likelihood not *the* Christ*.* Though Lyndon’s algorithm provides clarity and higher resolution to both past and present events, it also reinforces a competing many-worlds model that Forest refuses to embrace. For Forest, the many-worlds model negates the possibility of ever encountering *the* Amaya, only *an* Amaya, and also brings with it the burden of free will. Only in a deterministic world can Forest reunite with his Amaya, absolve himself, and also, by the way, attain worldchanging technical transfiguration on behalf of Katie, her team, and Amaya the company.\n\nThrough the exercise of quantum capabilities, we arrive at the fourth link in the folk horror chain: **manifestation**. Amaya, Joan of Arc, Jesus, a reanimated mouse, a skull, the near future, and more, are all conjured into focus by the Devs team as they play God with quantum dice. By summoning these events which point toward the horror of past and future deaths, we come to understand that they are driven by a metaphorical demon teased from the quantum system itself.\n\nEven the very ritual that Katie plays out in scanning and modeling the atomic-scale structure of her collected objects arranged almost Kabbalah-like on an etched altar, has an element of an engineered manifestation, bringing the mouse back in computational form, alive within the simulation that may be reality. Forest’s desire to manage the universe, through a concoction of near-infinite finite knowledge and godlike computing power allows him to become the feared magician in a physical universe, even if it is the byproduct of his pursuit of moral absolution.\n\n![Devs/FX (2020)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*O_p1_UaoTnVmtZNTAoUJnA.jpeg)\n\nBeyond the chain itself, *Devs* is riddled with symbolic imagery, from glowing halos in the woods to mirrored pillars that invite scrying, sigil-like formulae chalked on walls and a sacrificial death by fire. The Christian and the pagan sit side-by-side as if we should hold them both in a single realm of belief, as mirror images of ritual and superstition. Resurrection is both possible and forbidden. Sometimes the sacrifice of others is the means of redemption (The Wicker Man, *Midsommar*, etc*.*), and sometimes it is part of the transgression, as with Sergei’s staged immolation in *Devs*.\n\nThere are some subtle and not so subtle plays with color and color-coding. Devs team members Stewart and Sergei both wear green camouflage in different scenes, a touch of the [Green Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Man), and perhaps also a flagging of their godlike, superhuman nature as developer-geniuses. “The sign of \\[the Green Man’s\\] presence is the ability to work or experience with tireless enthusiasm beyond one’s normal capacities,” says William Anderson in his 1990 analysis of this central figure in European folklore and frequent folk horror cameo player. Likewise, in common with a great deal of folk horror cinematography, a golden thread, runs through *Devs* aesthetically: the golden cage inside, and the golden pillars outside, the golden mandala at the door, designate the space of the Devs team as a magical zone, even serving a functional purpose as it provides [a superconducting material](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190628153454.htm) for the computation within.\n\nIn one clever multilayered easter egg, Lily reads a copy of Sylvia Plath’s *[The Colossus & Other Poems](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/89119/the-colossus)* in bed as she waits for Sergei to return from his first day at Devs. The titular poem, inspired by Plath’s ouija board excursions with her husband, the poet Ted Hughes, centers around mourning for a fallen loved one and the inability to ever reconstruct those lost (here, her father), and is a subtle critique of ineffectual oracles. The poem brings to mind Forest’s yearning for his lost Amaya, which is etched on every idle screen and large surface connected with the company. *Colossus* reinforces the gothic, Poe-esque vein of loss, mourning and desire to resurrect that runs through the story, yet also manages, in double meaning, to play off the name of [one of the earliest computers](https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/colossus/index.htm).\n\n![Devs/FX (2020)](https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/1\\*P4_rOIkFWvN7aKJK2gfnBQ.jpeg)\n\nWhat does it matter that Alex Garland laced this TV show about messianic tech entrepreneurs gone mad with folk horror signs and signifiers? It matters inasmuch as it represents a critique of this increasingly well-trodden theme, but with a subtle difference. Folk horror provides a way to frame not only the pursuit of the powers of prediction via Big Data as problematic but meddling with the mechanics of the universe by poking at quantum models as transgressive, perhaps even sacrilegious.\n\nGarland is not the first to take on technology and technologists through this genre. Pioneering film and TV writer Nigel Kneale’s 1972 teleplay [The Stone Tape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV5kqdOHIoo) made for the BBC, set in a haunted country house where the R&D team of an electronics company comes up against the trapped psychic energy of a long-dead inhabitant, takes on some now-familiar themes of attempting to control realms of the world beyond human understanding via technology. In Kneale’s story, as in Garland’s, man’s attempt to reduce the supernatural to invokable code is the real crime.\n\n![The Stone Tapes/BBC (1972)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*D3a1k8SWNNARyjTAU0-WTg.jpeg?size=medium)\n\nFolk horror is often about the universe bringing itself back to equilibrium in the face of mortal trespass across the boundaries of the natural. In his 1968 opening to that bible of early Valley counterculture, *[The Whole Earth Catalog](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/the-complicated-legacy-of-stewart-brands-whole-earth-catalog)*, Stewart Brand declared “We are as gods and might as well get good at it.” Brand presumably sought to encourage others to self-determination and control over the space they occupied—a kind of inspiration to and a manifesto for what would come to be called the [Californian Ideology](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/californian-ideology) by academics Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron. But [it has also been subtly interpreted by some as a license to act in godlike ways](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/the-complicated-legacy-of-stewart-brands-whole-earth-catalog) — to control and shape the environment, and wield tools that bend the world as they see fit, whether computing systems, data or business models, all in the name of individual greatness, even as these decisions and actions subsume the interests or desires of others.\n\nIn this strange meritocracy, transcendence to a more perfect state of frictionless being has become central to the Valley mythos, whether via [full spectrum meal-replacement gruel](https://onezero.medium.com/i-lived-off-homemade-soylent-for-a-week-during-a-global-crisis-8aa32742eec4), [the plasma of youth](https://www.inc.com/jeff-bercovici/peter-thiel-young-blood.html), or [the Singularity](https://www.kurzweilai.net/singularity-q-a). The knowledge graph is kind of a pyramid, at the top of which sits the all-seeing, all-controlling eye of the lords of the [Computational Class](https://qz.com/14153/the-rise-of-the-computational-class/). By sweeping in fifty years of Silicon Valley culture, from human elevation to inhuman inequality that makes up both sides of the Valley multiverse, this place where models of people take on more value than people themselves, where all-seeing eyes are [superintended](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-palantir-peter-thiel/), and lab-grown versions of nature are funded and fertilized, Garland invokes folk horror as a way to question whether the people who embody the mythical Valley mindset have themselves transgressed in their own self-elevation.\n\nIn a way, the viewer’s response is a kind of Rorschach test — is *Devs* only a coder-thriller, simple horror with hypermodern trappings, a philosophical puzzle, or something both older and newer simultaneously? There is no compulsion to see things through the lens outlined here. It can be enjoyed as the viewer wishes. But if, as has been the theme for the past few decades, we are expected to embrace technology as a kind of higher wizardry (bowing to Clarke’s Third Law: “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”), it’s not a bad time to ask whether we wish to be enchanted, particularly as quantum computing pulls us into new entanglements with physics, cosmology, philosophy, and debating the very nature of reality.\n\n                                                                   \\*\\*\\*", "timestamp": 1633777421, "digest": "cGnR5S0LPrGNZ6ae7U7lAcE2FbpUUqKFlX7X_beQyPA", "contributor": "0xb29736DDd6d250C0a6dBdd84813dD4FcdaCb291d"}

But I am scared we might be magicians.*\n>\n> — “Devs” Season 1, Episode 4\n\nLike any good mage, Forest, the charismatic founder of Amaya, wields the term “scared” here less out of simple fear, and more in the guise of single-minded anticipation, the finely-balanced dread mixed with a longing that colors the face of a doctor, archaeologist or explorer about to knowingly transgress the boundaries of the natural order and reanimate the dead, read from the forbidden spellbook or open a tomb lined with treasure. His is a recognition of certain moral exceptionalism, the realization that he and his team are going somewhere no one has gone before. There also seems to be a tacit understanding that this comes with inevitable penalties — but it’s a price worth paying.\n\nThis exchange in Alex Garland’s breakout series *[Devs](https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/devs)* is the first concrete signifier of the tension which sits at the heart of this spare, brainy, and deeply atmospheric drama. The story Garland is telling seems to be just another statement about Big Tech, complete with the glossy wrapper of overhead drone shots, golden lens flares, affectless tech prodigies, and an eclectic, yet devotional [soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0XqfCYjdqWhZhjy66ZrFHl?si=pWUWrT2XRZmW1InYMDRUZQ).\n\nAs posited by the [Copenhagen Interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation) of quantum computing, when measured differently, Devs could be something else entirely. Intentional or not (and I have to believe it is) what Garland has created is a work of [folk horror](https://www.ritesofspring.co.uk/folk-horror), centered on Silicon Valley — the place and the mindset. While it’s not an end-to-end set piece in the full genre tradition, the core of *Devs* is full of signifiers and sigils, tropes, motifs, and easter eggs, which suggest that Garland, at the very least, leans heavily on this story form as a way to shape his morality tale. Quantum computing and big data provide the dark magic, but the Valley serves up the other necessary ingredients of dangerously opaque cultures and communities, transgressive acts, and self-martyrdom with presumed punishments and rewards.\n\n![Devs/FX (2020)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*e9v_76wdseRvytuFXNjRmg.jpeg)\n\nA fixture of British cinema and TV in the 1960s and 70s, films like Michael Reeves’ *[Witchfinder General](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98gzk6VSzfU)* *(1968), Piers Haggard’s [Blood On Satan’s Claw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RMySPyhMUY) (1971), and of course, Robin Hardy’s [The Wicker Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-tDnavDCwI)* (1973), established canon for this niche genre of storytelling. Folk horror has a rather long history in cinematic terms, by some accountings reaching back as far as Swedish-Danish silent film *[Häxan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYTv7mIBfdY)* *(1922), but it has enjoyed a resurgence in recent years, whole or thematically, through the work of [Peter Strickland](http://sensesofcinema.com/2019/the-analogues-of-peter-strickland/the-faraway-forest-in-peter-stricklands-katalin-varga-the-duke-of-burgundy-and-the-cobblers-lot/), director of [Katalin Varga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTjObn2W5I)* *(2009), [The Duke of Burgundy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-xIMBnclyA)* *(2015), and [In Fabric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biHUTtV4K40)* *(2019)*, Ben Wheatley’s *Kill List* *(2011) and [A Field in England](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRRvzjkzu2U)* (2013), Robert Egger’s debut *[The VVitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hba3cmYQ-e8)* *(2015), and the BBC-Netflix collaboration [Requiem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlOk23dC98Q)* (2018). Most recently, this genre has been thoroughly examined in Kier-La Janisse’s documentary *[Woodlands Dark and Days Bewitched](https://woodlandsdarkanddaysbewitched.com/)*.\n\nAri Aster has brought folk horror to new generations of American viewers through his back-to-back hits *[Hereditary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6wWKNij_1M)* (2018) about a multi-generational secret that destroys a family, and the more obvious *[Midsommar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Vnghdsjmd0)* (2019), which tells a tale of a group of twentysomething friends who travel to observe a Swedish summer ritual as a way to get away from anxiety and relationship stagnation at home, only to find something slightly more terrifying amidst the *Kinfolk*-ready pastoral purity.\n\n![Hereditary/A24 (2018)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*OAmJ2LcqVEG7NVDT)\n\nWhat defines folk horror? Critics and the few scholars who actively study it seem to agree that as a genre there are some recurring structural patterns, as well as a delineated catalog of aesthetics, icons, and imagery. Garland places enough of these throughout *Devs* to make it seem less than coincidence that folk horror is a narrative formula for the story, as well as a signpost toward its interpretation. Garland has used similar components in his rich catalog of film work, though *Devs* is the first time he has stitched together the folk horror aesthetic so distinctly and collectively.\n\nFolk horror plots don’t follow a strict structure, such as the hero’s journey, but writer and filmmaker Adam Scovell, author of “[Folk Horror: Hours Dreadful and Things Strange](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/folk-horror/9781911325222)” has proposed what he calls the “[folk horror chain](https://celluloidwickerman.com/2014/09/25/the-folk-horror-chain/),” a sequence of elements that are common to this genre: elements of **landscape**, **isolation**, **belief**, and summoning, or \\*\\*manifestation \\*\\*of the unnatural.\n\n![Annihilation/Paramount (2018)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*m2U3XYBEfJxNJ-pEci3Nyg.jpeg)\n\nSilicon Valley itself is already rich in its [own folklore](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1545&bih=885&sxsrf=ALeKk01djD3EotWpNPL2BzVNhRj2N86xYw%3A1595024814565&ei=riUSX-P-IcezsAeR-rG4CQ&q=books+about+silicon+valley+history&oq=&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQARgCMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcILhDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcILhDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnUABYAGDUO2gBcAB4AIABAIgBAJIBAJgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXqwAQo&sclient=psy-ab) — as much in its still forests and shadowy canyons, as in its military installations and university labs. The primary locus for the drama is an archetypal secluded tech campus, where the “move fast and break things” ethos, [disregard of time as a metric of human rhythms](https://www.academia.edu/8327298/Time_and_Identity_in_Folk_Horror), and deep faith in data above all governs everyone’s lives. Without much exaggeration, Garland found a community that provides, in terms of the first chain link of **location**, a setting that captures the hubris of not only an industry — tech writ large — or locale — a beautiful but decaying [San Francisco](https://www.salon.com/2019/02/20/in-the-past-year-silicon-valley-became-even-more-dystopian-unequal-report/) and [the Valley](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/silicon-valley-pescadero/531423/) — but its mental state as well.\n\nIn the opening seconds of the first episode, we see Forest standing seemingly alone in a wood after dusk, followed quickly by the contrasting hardness of San Francisco, itself a kind of “edge of the world,” geographically, culturally, economically and intellectually (even this city, in its seeming emptiness and silence, fits Scovell’s definition of “[urban wyrd](https://celluloidwickerman.com/2015/04/13/the-urban-wyrd-in-folk-horror/)”). We soon find out this Patagonia-perfect woodland is home to the sequestered, almost retreat-like campus of Amaya, Forest’s tech company, situated amid the remaining evergreen forests that dot the peninsula. Sited on the real-life campus of UC Santa Cruz, mythical Amaya sits adjacent to, but distinctly apart from the sprawling suburbs and strip malls of Silicon Valley — at the *edge* of the edge, reminiscent of Summerisle of *The* *Wicker Man*, accessible but distant enough.\n\nEven as a buzzing campus full of techies mill about with ant-like energy, Amaya is no typical corporate home. It is a kind of hushed cathedral of brutalist bulk, overshadowed by the colossus of Amaya herself — a towering statue of Forest’s dead daughter — set amongst a kind of reverential amphitheater where employees go to contemplate the infinite. The sweeping drone’s eye view gives us an overview of both Amayas, figure, and space, glinting in the golden hour (those with sharp eyes and good memories may recall the name of the desolate installation within the Shimmer in Garland’s *Annihilation*: Fort Amaya).\n\n![Devs/FX (2020)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*XCMy0Zxdv5mDvi43CKRiAw.jpeg)\n\nCinematically, this bucolic *mise en* *scène* transports us directly to a natural **isolation**, which is a perfect trope of the genre: the woods, the trees, the water, the path, the quiet, the reverential movement of people. As the second element in the chain, we see this use of remoteness in the classics of folk horror forty years prior, and it’s echoed here. As an audience, we’re immediately introduced to a principal character of the construct — nature, as both haven and hero.\n\nThe Devs facility itself is isolation-within-isolation. A kind of chapel in the woods, if a chapel had “A lead faraday shield, a thirteen-yard thick concrete shell, then a gold mesh…then an eight-yard vacuum seal, totally unbroken,” this world-within-a-world houses Devs, the unit. The structure, [one eagle-eyed Redditor recently noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Devs/comments/g551f5/the_devs_building_and_the_hebrew_tabernacle/), bears a striking similarity to the tabernacle built by the Israelites at God’s instruction, to house the Ark of the Covenant.\n\n![Devs/FX (2020)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*QHFU1FOGGG54_e-KYkYnCA.png)\n\nSymbolically, *Devs* is many things, and Garland has shoehorned a lot of arcana from various religions and mythologies into the story, but most of all, the building itself is a universe within a universe — potentially within universes — though it most importantly houses Amaya’s god-like quantum computer. The Devs team communes around it in silent contemplation, coding, and experimenting, free from the constraints of the outside world.\n\nScovell notes that this separation is key to the delta that develops between common morality, balance, or belief systems, which the protagonists are drawn into through the Devs project. “There’s little doubt that folk horror and its happenings rely on events being located outside of general society in both a physical and in a sociological way,” he writes in his 2014 thesis on the subject. If any setting in contemporary society sits apart from the economic, moral, social, and even political moorings of *our* world, it’s the world of cloud, code, and algorithm that is Big Tech.\n\nThe next link in the chain, **belief**, is central to the work of the Devs team. Forest’s quest, and by extension, Katie’s and the Devs’ mission is to use the “magic” of quantum computing to model past events. The question under consideration is to conclude whether the universe is deterministic, with a single past and future, or a multi-verse of many possible worlds. Forest holds a deterministic view because it suggests a probability of accurate reconstruction of the past and equally accurate prediction, one minute, one year, or one millennium into the future. It’s no accident that efforts to model a singular past in greater resolution suggest a symmetric model of future-gazing capabilities. The byproduct of this symmetry though is that Forest *believes* he will have the ability to look back to, and potentially experience, a high-resolution realization of his daughter Amaya, taken from him in an auto accident for which he feels responsible.\n\n![Devs/FX (2020)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*h3jedMXKC3t_FmR8JkptLQ.jpeg)\n\nThis journey toward discovering the scientific truth of the universe as understood in certain quantum models *is* Forest’s religion. It also affords him a morality trump card for the future, which absolves him from the premeditated murders (or sacrifices, *even*) of Sergei, a dev who is caught spying by Katie and Forest, and Lily’s ex-boyfriend-turned accomplice Jamie, in addition to the attempted murders of several others, and the death by suicide of another Devs team member. Determinism underpins Forest’s pursuit of self-martyrdom. His attempt to resurrect his dead daughter is aligned with the universe’s intentions, most advanced in its approach, and is therefore morally acceptable because it was always going to happen, as will anything he does to further the project. In this world, *he knows not what he does*, and yet, he does.\n\nWhen the teenaged prodigy Lyndon throws a wrench into Forest’s morality-warped deterministic belief system by injecting a multiverse-based model, the quantum computer is able to realize higher-definition versions of the past — notably by delivering the voice of Christ on the Cross as he pleads to his Father, except it’s *a Christ*, in all likelihood not *the* Christ*.* Though Lyndon’s algorithm provides clarity and higher resolution to both past and present events, it also reinforces a competing many-worlds model that Forest refuses to embrace. For Forest, the many-worlds model negates the possibility of ever encountering *the* Amaya, only *an* Amaya, and also brings with it the burden of free will. Only in a deterministic world can Forest reunite with his Amaya, absolve himself, and also, by the way, attain worldchanging technical transfiguration on behalf of Katie, her team, and Amaya the company.\n\nThrough the exercise of quantum capabilities, we arrive at the fourth link in the folk horror chain: **manifestation**. Amaya, Joan of Arc, Jesus, a reanimated mouse, a skull, the near future, and more, are all conjured into focus by the Devs team as they play God with quantum dice. By summoning these events which point toward the horror of past and future deaths, we come to understand that they are driven by a metaphorical demon teased from the quantum system itself.\n\nEven the very ritual that Katie plays out in scanning and modeling the atomic-scale structure of her collected objects arranged almost Kabbalah-like on an etched altar, has an element of an engineered manifestation, bringing the mouse back in computational form, alive within the simulation that may be reality. Forest’s desire to manage the universe, through a concoction of near-infinite finite knowledge and godlike computing power allows him to become the feared magician in a physical universe, even if it is the byproduct of his pursuit of moral absolution.\n\n![Devs/FX (2020)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*O_p1_UaoTnVmtZNTAoUJnA.jpeg)\n\nBeyond the chain itself, *Devs* is riddled with symbolic imagery, from glowing halos in the woods to mirrored pillars that invite scrying, sigil-like formulae chalked on walls and a sacrificial death by fire. The Christian and the pagan sit side-by-side as if we should hold them both in a single realm of belief, as mirror images of ritual and superstition. Resurrection is both possible and forbidden. Sometimes the sacrifice of others is the means of redemption (The Wicker Man, *Midsommar*, etc*.*), and sometimes it is part of the transgression, as with Sergei’s staged immolation in *Devs*.\n\nThere are some subtle and not so subtle plays with color and color-coding.

But I am scared we might be magicians.*\n>\n> — “Devs” Season 1, Episode 4\n\nLike any good mage, Forest, the charismatic founder of Amaya, wields the term “scared” here less out of simple fear, and more in the guise of single-minded anticipation, the finely-balanced dread mixed with a longing that colors the face of a doctor, archaeologist or explorer about to knowingly transgress the boundaries of the natural order and reanimate the dead, read from the forbidden spellbook or open a tomb lined with treasure. His is a recognition of certain moral exceptionalism, the realization that he and his team are going somewhere no one has gone before. There also seems to be a tacit understanding that this comes with inevitable penalties — but it’s a price worth paying.\n\nThis exchange in Alex Garland’s breakout series *[Devs](https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/devs)* is the first concrete signifier of the tension which sits at the heart of this spare, brainy, and deeply atmospheric drama. The story Garland is telling seems to be just another statement about Big Tech, complete with the glossy wrapper of overhead drone shots, golden lens flares, affectless tech prodigies, and an eclectic, yet devotional [soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0XqfCYjdqWhZhjy66ZrFHl?si=pWUWrT2XRZmW1InYMDRUZQ).\n\nAs posited by the [Copenhagen Interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation) of quantum computing, when measured differently, Devs could be something else entirely. Intentional or not (and I have to believe it is) what Garland has created is a work of [folk horror](https://www.ritesofspring.co.uk/folk-horror), centered on Silicon Valley — the place and the mindset. While it’s not an end-to-end set piece in the full genre tradition, the core of *Devs* is full of signifiers and sigils, tropes, motifs, and easter eggs, which suggest that Garland, at the very least, leans heavily on this story form as a way to shape his morality tale. Quantum computing and big data provide the dark magic, but the Valley serves up the other necessary ingredients of dangerously opaque cultures and communities, transgressive acts, and self-martyrdom with presumed punishments and rewards.\n\n![Devs/FX (2020)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*e9v_76wdseRvytuFXNjRmg.jpeg)\n\nA fixture of British cinema and TV in the 1960s and 70s, films like Michael Reeves’ *[Witchfinder General](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98gzk6VSzfU)* *(1968), Piers Haggard’s [Blood On Satan’s Claw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RMySPyhMUY) (1971), and of course, Robin Hardy’s [The Wicker Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-tDnavDCwI)* (1973), established canon for this niche genre of storytelling. Folk horror has a rather long history in cinematic terms, by some accountings reaching back as far as Swedish-Danish silent film *[Häxan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYTv7mIBfdY)* *(1922), but it has enjoyed a resurgence in recent years, whole or thematically, through the work of [Peter Strickland](http://sensesofcinema.com/2019/the-analogues-of-peter-strickland/the-faraway-forest-in-peter-stricklands-katalin-varga-the-duke-of-burgundy-and-the-cobblers-lot/), director of [Katalin Varga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTjObn2W5I)* *(2009), [The Duke of Burgundy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-xIMBnclyA)* *(2015), and [In Fabric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biHUTtV4K40)* *(2019)*, Ben Wheatley’s *Kill List* *(2011) and [A Field in England](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRRvzjkzu2U)* (2013), Robert Egger’s debut *[The VVitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hba3cmYQ-e8)* *(2015), and the BBC-Netflix collaboration [Requiem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlOk23dC98Q)* (2018). Most recently, this genre has been thoroughly examined in Kier-La Janisse’s documentary *[Woodlands Dark and Days Bewitched](https://woodlandsdarkanddaysbewitched.com/)*.\n\nAri Aster has brought folk horror to new generations of American viewers through his back-to-back hits *[Hereditary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6wWKNij_1M)* (2018) about a multi-generational secret that destroys a family, and the more obvious *[Midsommar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Vnghdsjmd0)* (2019), which tells a tale of a group of twentysomething friends who travel to observe a Swedish summer ritual as a way to get away from anxiety and relationship stagnation at home, only to find something slightly more terrifying amidst the *Kinfolk*-ready pastoral purity.\n\n![Hereditary/A24 (2018)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*OAmJ2LcqVEG7NVDT)\n\nWhat defines folk horror? Critics and the few scholars who actively study it seem to agree that as a genre there are some recurring structural patterns, as well as a delineated catalog of aesthetics, icons, and imagery. Garland places enough of these throughout *Devs* to make it seem less than coincidence that folk horror is a narrative formula for the story, as well as a signpost toward its interpretation. Garland has used similar components in his rich catalog of film work, though *Devs* is the first time he has stitched together the folk horror aesthetic so distinctly and collectively.\n\nFolk horror plots don’t follow a strict structure, such as the hero’s journey, but writer and filmmaker Adam Scovell, author of “[Folk Horror: Hours Dreadful and Things Strange](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/folk-horror/9781911325222)” has proposed what he calls the “[folk horror chain](https://celluloidwickerman.com/2014/09/25/the-folk-horror-chain/),” a sequence of elements that are common to this genre: elements of **landscape**, **isolation**, **belief**, and summoning, or \\*\\*manifestation \\*\\*of the unnatural.\n\n![Annihilation/Paramount (2018)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*m2U3XYBEfJxNJ-pEci3Nyg.jpeg)\n\nSilicon Valley itself is already rich in its [own folklore](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1545&bih=885&sxsrf=ALeKk01djD3EotWpNPL2BzVNhRj2N86xYw%3A1595024814565&ei=riUSX-P-IcezsAeR-rG4CQ&q=books+about+silicon+valley+history&oq=&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQARgCMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcILhDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcILhDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnMgcIIxDqAhAnUABYAGDUO2gBcAB4AIABAIgBAJIBAJgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXqwAQo&sclient=psy-ab) — as much in its still forests and shadowy canyons, as in its military installations and university labs. The primary locus for the drama is an archetypal secluded tech campus, where the “move fast and break things” ethos, [disregard of time as a metric of human rhythms](https://www.academia.edu/8327298/Time_and_Identity_in_Folk_Horror), and deep faith in data above all governs everyone’s lives. Without much exaggeration, Garland found a community that provides, in terms of the first chain link of **location**, a setting that captures the hubris of not only an industry — tech writ large — or locale — a beautiful but decaying [San Francisco](https://www.salon.com/2019/02/20/in-the-past-year-silicon-valley-became-even-more-dystopian-unequal-report/) and [the Valley](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/silicon-valley-pescadero/531423/) — but its mental state as well.\n\nIn the opening seconds of the first episode, we see Forest standing seemingly alone in a wood after dusk, followed quickly by the contrasting hardness of San Francisco, itself a kind of “edge of the world,” geographically, culturally, economically and intellectually (even this city, in its seeming emptiness and silence, fits Scovell’s definition of “[urban wyrd](https://celluloidwickerman.com/2015/04/13/the-urban-wyrd-in-folk-horror/)”). We soon find out this Patagonia-perfect woodland is home to the sequestered, almost retreat-like campus of Amaya, Forest’s tech company, situated amid the remaining evergreen forests that dot the peninsula. Sited on the real-life campus of UC Santa Cruz, mythical Amaya sits adjacent to, but distinctly apart from the sprawling suburbs and strip malls of Silicon Valley — at the *edge* of the edge, reminiscent of Summerisle of *The* *Wicker Man*, accessible but distant enough.\n\nEven as a buzzing campus full of techies mill about with ant-like energy, Amaya is no typical corporate home. It is a kind of hushed cathedral of brutalist bulk, overshadowed by the colossus of Amaya herself — a towering statue of Forest’s dead daughter — set amongst a kind of reverential amphitheater where employees go to contemplate the infinite. The sweeping drone’s eye view gives us an overview of both Amayas, figure, and space, glinting in the golden hour (those with sharp eyes and good memories may recall the name of the desolate installation within the Shimmer in Garland’s *Annihilation*: Fort Amaya).\n\n![Devs/FX (2020)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*XCMy0Zxdv5mDvi43CKRiAw.jpeg)\n\nCinematically, this bucolic *mise en* *scène* transports us directly to a natural **isolation**, which is a perfect trope of the genre: the woods, the trees, the water, the path, the quiet, the reverential movement of people. As the second element in the chain, we see this use of remoteness in the classics of folk horror forty years prior, and it’s echoed here. As an audience, we’re immediately introduced to a principal character of the construct — nature, as both haven and hero.\n\nThe Devs facility itself is isolation-within-isolation. A kind of chapel in the woods, if a chapel had “A lead faraday shield, a thirteen-yard thick concrete shell, then a gold mesh…then an eight-yard vacuum seal, totally unbroken,” this world-within-a-world houses Devs, the unit. The structure, [one eagle-eyed Redditor recently noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Devs/comments/g551f5/the_devs_building_and_the_hebrew_tabernacle/), bears a striking similarity to the tabernacle built by the Israelites at God’s instruction, to house the Ark of the Covenant.\n\n![Devs/FX (2020)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*QHFU1FOGGG54_e-KYkYnCA.png)\n\nSymbolically, *Devs* is many things, and Garland has shoehorned a lot of arcana from various religions and mythologies into the story, but most of all, the building itself is a universe within a universe — potentially within universes — though it most importantly houses Amaya’s god-like quantum computer. The Devs team communes around it in silent contemplation, coding, and experimenting, free from the constraints of the outside world.\n\nScovell notes that this separation is key to the delta that develops between common morality, balance, or belief systems, which the protagonists are drawn into through the Devs project. “There’s little doubt that folk horror and its happenings rely on events being located outside of general society in both a physical and in a sociological way,” he writes in his 2014 thesis on the subject. If any setting in contemporary society sits apart from the economic, moral, social, and even political moorings of *our* world, it’s the world of cloud, code, and algorithm that is Big Tech.\n\nThe next link in the chain, **belief**, is central to the work of the Devs team. Forest’s quest, and by extension, Katie’s and the Devs’ mission is to use the “magic” of quantum computing to model past events. The question under consideration is to conclude whether the universe is deterministic, with a single past and future, or a multi-verse of many possible worlds. Forest holds a deterministic view because it suggests a probability of accurate reconstruction of the past and equally accurate prediction, one minute, one year, or one millennium into the future. It’s no accident that efforts to model a singular past in greater resolution suggest a symmetric model of future-gazing capabilities. The byproduct of this symmetry though is that Forest *believes* he will have the ability to look back to, and potentially experience, a high-resolution realization of his daughter Amaya, taken from him in an auto accident for which he feels responsible.\n\n![Devs/FX (2020)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*h3jedMXKC3t_FmR8JkptLQ.jpeg)\n\nThis journey toward discovering the scientific truth of the universe as understood in certain quantum models *is* Forest’s religion. It also affords him a morality trump card for the future, which absolves him from the premeditated murders (or sacrifices, *even*) of Sergei, a dev who is caught spying by Katie and Forest, and Lily’s ex-boyfriend-turned accomplice Jamie, in addition to the attempted murders of several others, and the death by suicide of another Devs team member. Determinism underpins Forest’s pursuit of self-martyrdom. His attempt to resurrect his dead daughter is aligned with the universe’s intentions, most advanced in its approach, and is therefore morally acceptable because it was always going to happen, as will anything he does to further the project. In this world, *he knows not what he does*, and yet, he does.\n\nWhen the teenaged prodigy Lyndon throws a wrench into Forest’s morality-warped deterministic belief system by injecting a multiverse-based model, the quantum computer is able to realize higher-definition versions of the past — notably by delivering the voice of Christ on the Cross as he pleads to his Father, except it’s *a Christ*, in all likelihood not *the* Christ\\*.\\* Though Lyndon’s algorithm provides clarity and higher resolution to both past and present events, it also reinforces a competing many-worlds model that Forest refuses to embrace. For Forest, the many-worlds model negates the possibility of ever encountering *the* Amaya, only *an* Amaya, and also brings with it the burden of free will. Only in a deterministic world can Forest reunite with his Amaya, absolve himself, and also, by the way, attain worldchanging technical transfiguration on behalf of Katie, her team, and Amaya the company.\n\nThrough the exercise of quantum capabilities, we arrive at the fourth link in the folk horror chain: **manifestation**. Amaya, Joan of Arc, Jesus, a reanimated mouse, a skull, the near future, and more, are all conjured into focus by the Devs team as they play God with quantum dice. By summoning these events which point toward the horror of past and future deaths, we come to understand that they are driven by a metaphorical demon teased from the quantum system itself.\n\nEven the very ritual that Katie plays out in scanning and modeling the atomic-scale structure of her collected objects arranged almost Kabbalah-like on an etched altar, has an element of an engineered manifestation, bringing the mouse back in computational form, alive within the simulation that may be reality. Forest’s desire to manage the universe, through a concoction of near-infinite finite knowledge and godlike computing power allows him to become the feared magician in a physical universe, even if it is the byproduct of his pursuit of moral absolution.\n\n![Devs/FX (2020)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*O_p1_UaoTnVmtZNTAoUJnA.jpeg)\n\nBeyond the chain itself, *Devs* is riddled with symbolic imagery, from glowing halos in the woods to mirrored pillars that invite scrying, sigil-like formulae chalked on walls and a sacrificial death by fire. The Christian and the pagan sit side-by-side as if we should hold them both in a single realm of belief, as mirror images of ritual and superstition. Resurrection is both possible and forbidden. Sometimes the sacrifice of others is the means of redemption (The Wicker Man, *Midsommar*, etc\\*.\\*), and sometimes it is part of the transgression, as with Sergei’s staged immolation in *Devs*.\n\nThere are some subtle and not so subtle plays with color and color-coding. Devs team members Stewart and Sergei both wear green camouflage in different scenes, a touch of the [Green Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Man), and perhaps also a flagging of their godlike, superhuman nature as developer-geniuses. “The sign of \\[the Green Man’s\\] presence is the ability to work or experience with tireless enthusiasm beyond one’s normal capacities,” says William Anderson in his 1990 analysis of this central figure in European folklore and frequent folk horror cameo player. Likewise, in common with a great deal of folk horror cinematography, a golden thread, runs through *Devs* aesthetically: the golden cage inside, and the golden pillars outside, the golden mandala at the door, designate the space of the Devs team as a magical zone, even serving a functional purpose as it provides [a superconducting material](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190628153454.htm) for the computation within.\n\nIn one clever multilayered easter egg, Lily reads a copy of Sylvia Plath’s *[The Colossus & Other Poems](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/89119/the-colossus)* in bed as she waits for Sergei to return from his first day at Devs. The titular poem, inspired by Plath’s ouija board excursions with her husband, the poet Ted Hughes, centers around mourning for a fallen loved one and the inability to ever reconstruct those lost (here, her father), and is a subtle critique of ineffectual oracles. The poem brings to mind Forest’s yearning for his lost Amaya, which is etched on every idle screen and large surface connected with the company. *Colossus* reinforces the gothic, Poe-esque vein of loss, mourning and desire to resurrect that runs through the story, yet also manages, in double meaning, to play off the name of [one of the earliest computers](https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/colossus/index.htm).\n\n![Devs/FX (2020)](https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/1\\*P4_rOIkFWvN7aKJK2gfnBQ.jpeg)\n\nWhat does it matter that Alex Garland laced this TV show about messianic tech entrepreneurs gone mad with folk horror signs and signifiers?

D·M·桑杜拉带着他八岁的女儿在阿尔塔米拉洞窟附近考察，女儿钻进一个从来没有成年人去过的石洞后，大喊：“有野牛！”。就这样，旧石器时代艺术的巅峰作品被戏剧般地发现了。\n\n石壁上大量的动物绘画是原始部落企图以巫术手段保证狩猎的成功，这种“交感巫术”并非基于审美的性质的出发点，却成为了标志西方艺术史的开端。\n\n![野牛、资本论、ERC-721

italiani, da Cimabue insino a' tempi nostri》\n\n时间来到 15 世纪，在熬过了中世纪宗教所漫长的干预之后，欧洲人对人文和理性有了全新的信心和认识，西方近代艺术史的开端「文艺复兴」运动在此兴起，期间涌出了达·芬奇、米开朗琪罗、拉斐尔等众多艺术家，他们用人文主义的方法在艺术创作中追寻现实主义和人类的情感，拉动了整个艺术史的进程。\n\n![野牛、资本论、ERC-721

Atene_》，表达对知识和理性的渴求\n\n二十世纪的艺术虽然不及文艺复兴时期的精绝，但在整个艺术史中却是极其活跃的年代，在百年间呈现出流派迭起的局面：在现代主义艺术中有抽象性流派的代表野兽派、立体派；象征性流派的代表英式新工艺派与前拉斐尔派、象征派、先知派、超现实派。在后现代主义艺术中，包括抽象现代派、波普艺术、新达达派、欧普艺术、照相写实派等。\n\n![野牛、资本论、ERC-721

头像潮流的雏形\n\n**02**\n\n**供给端：流失的剩余价值**\n\n*「商业利润从商品的流通中即商业资本家从经营商品的买卖中获得，但商业利润的创造仍来源于生产领域，它是剩余价值的一部分…商业利润并非产生于流通中，而是在流通中实现，它是产业工人创造的一部分剩余价值的转移，是商业资本参加利润平均化的必然结果。」*\n\n*——《资本论·第三卷》卡尔·马克思*\n\n艺术史发展至今，作为创作者对所处时代的思考和感受的承载，艺术创作的价值需要被看到、被承认，但诸如梵高去世后才被世人发掘其伟大成就的事迹，印证了艺术创作者往往不能实现自己作品的完整价值展现：对于艺术家，作品要获得受众的关注需要流量支持、交易流转也需要中间商铺路，剩余价值流失在了画廊、策展和拍卖行抽成等曲折过程中，而新兴创作者甚至没有机会进入这些环节。\n\n同时，艺术品真迹的价值在于它在一幅作品中凝结了创作者的灵感和血汗，而在遍布东南亚流水线工厂中的仿制画并不具备这样的价值。仿制画充当家居装饰尚无可厚非，但充当赝品流入艺术品交易市场，其中产生的鉴别费用与较高的参与门槛对收藏者的利益造成侵蚀，进而也损害了创作者的价值获取。\n\n在传统艺术市场，单件艺术品数年时间或仅流转几次，作品个体剩余价值的流失和流转渠道的堵塞，不仅在供给端是对创作者积极性的打压，而且在消费端构成了高昂的准入门槛，从而造成社会整体艺术价值的流失。\n\n**03**\n\n**消费端：社交资本**\n\n**ERC-721 协议**\n\n![野牛、资本论、ERC-721 协议，时空交汇在元宇宙](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/5f49a4aff0bc81c2864247bf2747f7bd.jpg-article)\n\n图源自 Veronica Coutts\n\n于 2018 年初推出的 ERC-721 协议为独特资产的链上映射提供了条件，即 Non-Fungible Tokens 非同质化代币：\n\n\\*\\*•\\*\\*NFT 是存储在区块链上的数据单位，通过增加近一步的识别元素来证明资产是独一无二的，因此也不能互换\n\n\\*\\*• \\*\\*ERC-721 目的是为不可互换 Token 的智能合约提供标准接口，使这些代币的流转和所有权的追踪成为可能\n\n\\*\\*• \\*\\*应用对象可以包含艺术品、虚拟收藏、房地产、债务和合约等\n\n上文的创作者们可以将自己的作品通过 ERC-721 协议打包成为 NFT，而收藏者可以直接在 OpenSea 等交易平台进行浏览和购买，依托便捷的区块链网络，双方直接交易省去了繁琐的中间环节，并实现了全时间不间断交易，清晰的所有权路径也杜绝了赝品，买卖活跃度和流通性对比传统艺术市场已然大幅提升。\n\n![野牛、资本论、ERC-721

Async Art、Foundation 和 Nifty Gateway 共售出了 997,392 件艺术品，总价值达 796,439,177 美元。\n\n个体最典型的例子是由业余艺术家 Beeple 创造的 NFT 交易历史，没受过专业艺术教育的他从 2007 年开始了一项业余爱好，用每天画一幅画来表达自己对于科技社会快速发展的质疑和思考。\n\n他的代表作《每一天：前 5000 天》由 5000 张数字插画拼成，制成 NFT 后，从 100 美元起拍、最终以 6934.6 万美元成交。凭借这幅画 Beeple 成了在世的第三贵艺术家，仅次于波普大师杰夫·昆斯和英国艺术教父大卫·霍克尼。\n\n**社交资本**\n\n*「在现实生活中，持有加密货币的百万富翁们面临着有限的实体投资机会以分散投资其财富，因此他们把目光转向了数字收藏品和 NFT 的新世界，从中寻找慰藉。」*\n\n*——Anders Petterson*\n\n那么在消费端，为什么藏家会对这些虚拟的数字资产产生购买需求，除了作品本身的艺术和审美价值，还可以衍生到社交资本——**Status-as-a-Service**。\n\n这个概念由科技评论家、前亚马逊产品负责人 Eugene Wei 提出。他认为：「在很多方面，社交资本是金融资本的主要指标，因此社交资本的本质需要更多的审视。它不仅是一种良好的投资或商业实践，而且通过分析社交资本动态，可以帮助解释所有看似非理性的线上行为」，并将其概括成两句原则：\n\n*• 人类是一群追求社会地位的猴子（People are status-seeking monkeys）*\n\n*• 人类会寻找最高效的途径来获得最多的社交资本（People seek out the most efficient path to maximizing social capital）*\n\n当人们在购买了一件 NFT 艺术品后，即获得了这件作品的全部所有权，心理情节会不自觉地对其进行美化，并倾向于在社交平台进行分享展示，以获得个人身份的认可。而最能获得身份认可的作品就是那些社区共识和外观辨识度最高的 NFT 作品，同时价格也最高昂，目前以 NFT 元祖项目 CryptoPunks 为代表。\n\n**加密朋克**\n\n![野牛、资本论、ERC-721 协议，时空交汇在元宇宙](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/a3c17c5d6d63352230c87fb25e6fb5c7.jpg-article)\n\nCryptoPunks 部分作品集，可见与上文波普艺术作品《玛丽莲梦露》的异曲同工之处\n\nCryptoPunks 始创于 2017 年，是人工智能随机生成的像素艺术头像，由 24x24、8bit 样式的不规则像素组成的艺术图像集合，一共发行 10000 个，每个都有独特的外形特征，在早期拥有以太坊地址即可免费申领。\n\nCryptoPunks 在 NFT 行业的地位类似比特币之于区块链，是 NFT 行业的首个项目，总量有限，免费申领的获取方式也符合区块链的文化精神，因此获得了更高的收藏溢价。\n\n8 月 2 日， “CryptoPunk 3100”拍卖挂出报价 35000 枚 ETH，最终成交价 42000 枚 ETH, 约合成 10860 万美元，为目前世界上单价最高的 NFT 作品。\n\n**04**\n\n**当一切交汇在元宇宙**\n\n*「大家来到绿洲是因为可以做各种事，但是他们沉沦于此是为了不一样的人生。」*\n\n*——《头号玩家》*\n\n当虚拟艺术和独有资产可以通过 NFT 转移到链上世界，个人也可以依靠自己的 NFT 资产打造链上的个人专属形象，进一步购买虚拟地块、房产、装扮或直接选择提供虚拟身份运营服务的机构，参与到链上世界——\\*\\*「元宇宙 Metaverse」\\*\\*中来。\n\n电影《头号玩家》以怀旧和致敬经典 IP 元素为主旨畅想未来虚拟社会，却无意间成为了「元宇宙」的宏大叙事和想象空间的注脚。元宇宙将个人在是「下一代的互联网」中的第二人生，是物理世界的无限延伸、治理机构的自适应以及更无限的创作内容。\n\n**为什么巨头会失败**\n\n__\n\n*「五年后，或者七年后，人们会主要认为我们是一家元宇宙公司，而不只是一家移动互联网公司。」*\n\n*—Facebook CEO 扎克伯格*\n\n目前各大互联网巨头也开启了元宇宙之路的探索，腾讯投资了 Roblox 并独家代理 Roblox 中国区产品发行、字节跳动以近 1 亿元投资了「中国版 Roblox」代码乾坤、美国游戏开发商 Epic 获 10

\\*\\*虚拟资产的“获得概率”的暗箱操作\n\n\\*\\*• \\*\\*中心化管理与强制封号\n\n\\*\\*• \\*\\*公司倒闭、团队解散\n\n\\*\\*• \\*\\*存储设施故障或停止托管\n\n上述问题的出现都将会使玩家手中的资产一文不值，尽管加密世界的元宇宙不如大厂制作精良，但这些资产是真实属于个人的，链上操作透明且交易自由，并通过 IPFS 和 Arweave 等去中心化协议可以实现长久的安全存储。\n\n**05**\n\n**元宇宙的时空旅行**\n\n*在元宇宙中，您将与朋友共度时光。例如，你们会进行交流。在未来，我们现在可能就生活在一个元宇宙中。它将是一个通信元空间，不是平面的而是 3D

**Decentraland、CryptoVoxels、The Sandbox** 等。在此深度体验元宇宙或想获得身份地位都需要在其中购置自己的土地。\n\n土地是社会重要的生产资料，在元宇宙里也是进行沉浸式体验的基础，房产建筑、商圈景点都依赖土地而建设，从而可以进一步在土地上展开社交活动。土地作为元宇宙重要的价值载体，其价值变动会随人口、流量的涌入和商业密度的增加或减少而上升或停滞，土地本身承载流量和共识的价值，土地的拥有者也会因此获得收益。\n\n**Decentraland**\n\nDecentraland 是比较早的区块链沙盒元宇宙游戏，最初的概念始于 2015 年，在 2020 年面向用户开放时，除了团队的基本建筑，大部分土地都是空的。但目前 Decentraland 的主城 Genesis City 已经具备了一个现代化城市全部的功能，创作者们甚至搭建出了博物馆、夜店等丰富的娱乐设施。\n\nDecentraland 上的建筑支持像素体搭建也支持导入 3D 建模，同时用户个人形象可选择性也较高，因而更加贴近现实和个性化。因为 COVID-19，很多无法线下举办的活动都选择通过在 Decentraland 上策展来实现非现实接触。\n\n![野牛、资本论、ERC-721 协议，时空交汇在元宇宙](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/c76673a1fa9100fac5d2179478c60e55.jpg-article)\n\nDecentraland 的名字由 Decentralized （去中心化）和 Land （土地）组成，土地也是 Decentraland 的价值根基。Decentraland 的主体是 Genesis City ，面积为 300\\*300Land，除了 40% 项目方自留地用于基础设施搭建，其余地块全部出售于用户，通过 Mana 进行交易。\n\n![野牛、资本论、ERC-721 协议，时空交汇在元宇宙](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/622eaeebf33086cb8c80acd113e40ea7.jpg-article)\n\n在 Decentraland 中，地块越大且越靠近街道或核心区域的地块越贵。Decentraland 近 30 天售价最高的地块为 271000 美金，当前最便宜地块售价 4300 美金。目前该项目日活跃地址数在 680 个左右，并支撑起了 20 万美金左右的日成交额。\n\n![野牛、资本论、ERC-721 协议，时空交汇在元宇宙](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/829909c3d9120c4da998fcae0aa41529.jpg-article)\n\nDecentraland 近一年的成交量变动趋势-nonfungible\n\n**CryptoVoxels**\n\nCryptoVoxels 也是构建在以太坊生态上的元宇宙，旨在利用创造力打造艺术性社交场所，聚焦展示需求。作为 3D 区块链沙盒游戏，CryptoVoxels 内置建筑编辑器、虚拟形象和文字聊天工具，简单的像素风格让用户更方便上手。创作者可以购买土地并构建美术馆、艺术画廊，普通用户可以自由参观浏览，并与别人产品进行参观购买等互动。\n\n![野牛、资本论、ERC-721 协议，时空交汇在元宇宙](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/a1f403c31191e640f5bf420f28a21e33.jpg-article)\n\n目前，CryptoVoxels 正在成为了加密原生艺术家、加密艺术平台举办线上画展最常选择的平台。近日，为了提升策展流量，CryptoVoxels 宣布将推出 BOOP 代币，将按照玩家建筑（parcel）的访客数量 1:1 发放 BOOP 代币空投奖励。\n\nCryptoVoxels 的地块和街道由城市生成器随机生成，其地理面积在以缓慢速度增长，最大规模将达到 36\\*18 公里。随机生成的地块大小不一，地块和所有的建筑，乃至小装饰 体素都是 NFT，可以在 OpenSea 等平台自由交易。在 CryptoVoxels 中，越靠近地图中心或建筑越密集（如法兰克福区域），则地块售价越高。\n\n![野牛、资本论、ERC-721 协议，时空交汇在元宇宙](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/bbf14e7d66fb8b3eb6b882566288cf3d.jpg-article)\n\nCryptoVoxels 近 30 天售价最高的地块为 64000 美金，当前最便宜地块售价 1500 美金。目前该项目日活跃地址数在 300 个左右，日成交额在 10 万美金左右。\n\n![野牛、资本论、ERC-721 协议，时空交汇在元宇宙](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/1107abe77f166416cfe9d40f940cfb8c.jpg-article)\n\nCryptoVoxels 近一年的成交量变动趋势-nonfungible\n\n**The Sandbox**\n\nThe Sandbox 整体游戏风格和设计机制很容易让人想起另一款风靡世界的游戏「我的世界 Minecraft」。但其团队「建立一个系统，让创作者能够在没有中央控制的情况下进行制作、游戏、分享和交易，享受安全的版权所有权，并能赚取 Sand」的使命，使他与「我的世界 Minecraft」有本质区别。\n\n![野牛、资本论、ERC-721 协议，时空交汇在元宇宙](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/fb84e7c16d8b04ec51b692c00247d20d.jpg-article)\n\nThe Sandbox 最初是在 2012 年由 Animoca Brands 开发的手机游戏，创造了 4000 万的下载量，随后在 2015 年通过 steam 平台登陆 PC，最后在 2019 年正式进入区块链行业，并推出了现在的版本。\n\nThe Sandbox 比 CryptoVoxels 和 Decentraland 的游戏性更强、玩法也更丰富。不同于在网页端就可以载入的 CryptoVoxels 与 Decentraland，The Sandbox 在电脑端下载应用程序，因而运行更加流畅，用户体验也更贴近日常游戏。\n\n![野牛、资本论、ERC-721 协议，时空交汇在元宇宙](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/f5584e25b9a3fe0db97eb56707b9ca41.jpg-article)\n\nThe Sandbox 旨在创建一个可持续的游戏和内容创作生态系统，该生态围绕游戏、地块、内容创作激励展开。用户不仅可以购买地块、体验游戏，而且可以通过 Voxel Editor 建模包创建三维三维体素，并通过 ERC 721 或 1155 格式发布，最后输出到 NFT 交易市场，成为游戏资产，在游玩和创作过程中实现 Play to Earn。\n\n![野牛、资本论、ERC-721 协议，时空交汇在元宇宙](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/d44890e27dc9a8c207eeffe01bd761ad.jpg-article)\n\n由于 The Sandbox 也在和 Avengeu Sevenfold、Goat lord、Atari 等 IP 品牌进行合作，玩家可以和品牌或名人成为邻居，并获得包括共同游玩、现场表演和社交体验在内的互动。The Sandbox 的地块价值体现不止是大小格局和地理方位，在临近品牌 IP 位置的地块，也将获得更好的溢价。\n\nThe Sandbox 近 30 天售价最高的地块为 68000 美金，较小的地块售价均低于 1ETH。目前该项目日活跃地址数在 1000 个左右，日成交额平均在 80 万美金附近波动。\n\n![野牛、资本论、ERC-721 协议，时空交汇在元宇宙](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/b741055af927c9b32260ac22721c4a53.jpg-article)\n\nThe Sandbox

NFT 的头像潮，杂糅了加密艺术、人文个性与所有权的元宇宙是区块链行业最具文化和风格影响力的 meme：\n\n区块链技术架构的演进一路从地心到地表搭建了链上新世界，并呈现出大规模、永续性、自生长的特征，创作的个体与受众产生最直接的连接，共识力量的凝聚筛选出了加密世界的核心资产，把用户放在最前沿、最中心的元宇宙带来了 new experience、better life、low cost 的体验，这场数字化的现代文艺复兴将把人类每一个成员带入全新的机遇之地。\n\n回望洞穴野牛的壁画，远古时期的人们没有化学颜料可供使用，但利用有颜色的矿物质、碳灰和泥土，混合动物脂肪与鲜血调和出的天然颜料，使它画出的色彩万年不褪，鲜艳生动如同昨日刚涂上颜色，以致让后续考察的专家队伍怀疑是当代赝品。\n\n现今，NFT 也可以通过将创作本身以及所有权永久定格在去中心化存储协议上，实现如「远古野牛」般的历久弥新，甚至可以在「元宇宙」里打造个人文化基因的永生，这是技术和时代赋予人类的礼物。\n\n*\\[参考资料\\]*\n\n*Eugene Wei——《Status-as-a-Service》Richard

{"id": "fQczdAgF3lwVz3YJBSGhMb0Zl3ZqteHSbvcoSK4cFuY", "title": "Kudo Money简介", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NndzsimYF5VRTTiZ497oA.jpg?height=510&width=987)\n\n## Kudo Money简介\n\n**Kudo的国库贷款 – Bitquity**\n\n目前在DeFi生态中，商业借贷市场存在巨大缺口。这令人震惊，因为任何经验丰富的经济学家都知道贷款是经济的“驱动力”。没有它，市场就会受到影响，因为项目和企业因缺乏可用资金而放缓甚至瘫痪。这已经反映在DeFi生态系统中，其中区块链公司和NFT艺术家的中小盘股目前通常无法获得足够的信贷或营运资金来发展。由于缺乏 KYC/AML 所涉及的风险，机构投资者也面临着参与 DeFi 的困难，这些风险一直存在于许多项目中。因此，对于DeFi债务融资者来说，市场上的巨大缺口是显而易见的，这将有助于借款人和投资者。\n\n这就是Kudo Money的用武之地。 Kudo Money的国库借贷平台Bitquity通过为ICO公司和 NFT艺术家等组织和个人提供债务融资和营运资金填补了这一市场空白。实体可以通过将自己的原生代币或NFT作为抵押品来获得贷款。这对区块链初创企业特别有用，他们不再需要出售代币来资助项目开发，而是可以接受Bitquity贷款。以前可能不愿意参与DeFi领域的机构投资者现在也可以放心了，因为Kudo矿池将提供安全的门户并支持获得批准的参与者的白名单。因此，Kudo具有巨大的未来增长潜力，因为它通过为众多不同的利益相关者提供利益来填补市场上的真正空白。\n\nKudo Money的Bitquity本质上是银行的改进替代品，企业和机构借款人可以从流动资金池获得债务融资。这些池允许借款人获得信贷，以及流动性提供者获得Kudo贷款簿，以风险调整回报奖励他们。因此，这对双方都有利——尤其是对借款人而言，因为他们不仅要支付费用，而且还要赚取费用，就像代币持有者和参与者一样。在许多方面，Bitquity优于标准银行，因为它摒弃了它们通常具有的许多缺点。将不再有效率低下的中间商、等待办公时间和令人讨厌的高昂清算价格。因此，Kudo Money的Bitquity是一种极具创新性的产品，对贷款人和借款人都有好处，\n\nYearn最近金库黑客事件的例子说明了对Kudo Money国库借贷产品的需求程度。为了支付黑客攻击的费用，Yearn不得不用$YFI借用稳定币——这是大多数协议无法做到的，因为它们没有在Aave或Compound上列出。Kudo Money使所有区块链公司都可以使用它，无论大小，并赋予他们借用营运资金的能力，而无需出售其原生代币。因此，Yearn的例子有助于巩固 Kudo Money未来广泛采用的理由，因为它表明Bitquity有能力解决DeFi领域的一个巨大问题——获得资本。\n\n**Kud 的风险和利率基准**\n\n贷款利率将由Kudo基准确定，该基准将基于智能合约，并根据代币抵押品和Kudo Credit数据等众多因素进行判断。这将使利率变得非常公平，特别是因为它基于Kudo风险评估框架，该框架非常详细，并为公司分配信用评分 - 从D到AAA。因此，投资者将全面了解他们为其提供流动性的公司的风险，从而全面了解他们所购买的证券。\n\n**Kudo 的开放货币市场**\n\nKudo平台的特别之处在于可以进入开放的货币市场。目前，产量农业的最大问题之一是您只能通过稳定币和ETH获得收益。Kudo填补了市场上的这一空白，因为它允许用户发布任何资产作为抵押品来借入任何支持的资产，然后自动赚取收益。然后，矿池将根据抵押品的价值重新平衡这种风险敞口，从而保护用户免受清算。此外，Kudo允许任何人创建资产池，成为他们自己的货币市场——创建货币市场市场！然后，每个矿池都将拥有自己的抵押品要求、利息曲线、预言机，甚至是他们自己的参与者白名单。这是一个非常创新的概念，\n\n**概括**\n\n总的来说，Kudo Money是一个极具创新性的项目，其产品在未来有可能被广泛采用。Kudo 的国库贷款及其利息和风险基准解决了加密领域的一个真正问题，使借款人和贷款人都受益。Kudo 的Open Money Markets进一步支持了这一点，它只会在未来增加其影响力和市场份额。总体而言，由于Kudo Money平台提供的众多优势，它很可能在DeFi革命中发挥关键作用，因此成为DeFi生态系统不可或缺的组成部分。", "timestamp": 1633781315, "digest": "uTFhexjfLb-wkOJncvszuSEOmE5SKKHShbOJWw3nuYk", "contributor": "0x005c0d08AF6B0C4b486916A7bd1F64b6fBaBB8D1"}

{"id": "5YiJj7jI1RoTgWCZB4WAWNfz1HKR3aBRUwAEN6KdcAw", "title": "矿工可提取价值", "body": "> 日渐增多的 MEV 可能导致了高昂的 Gas Fee\n\n在*[上一期](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//unblock256.substack.com/p/unblock-2021-5gas-fee-)*的周报中我们为大家介绍了 Gas Fee ， Gas Fee 越高，交易就越可能被矿工打包。本期我们就来讨论一下这种打包机制所产生的问题，**Miner-extractable Value**（MEV）。\n\nMEV 指的是矿工重新排序交易后可以获得的利润。在实际情况中， MEV 可能并不是矿工推动。有可能是我付出了一个很高的 Gas Fee ，希望矿工优先打包我的交易。\n\n希望矿工优先打包交易的原因有以下几种：\n\n### **抢跑（Frontrunning）**\n\n![](https://pic3.zhimg.com/v2-593f4916e32ddb46cd1cdb97d63b5d66\\_b.jpg)\n\n主流的 DEX 都支持滑点，也就是成交价格的区间，假设当前下单价格 100 块，滑点是 5%，这意味着成交价格会在 95 - 105 之间。\n\n**宽松的价格区间让套利者有机可乘。**\n\n假如一个套利者在内存池中（没有打包的交易都会在内存池中）看到一笔大额买单（币价即将上涨）。根据 AMM 的模型，只要有买单成交，代币价格就会上升。因此，套利者可以通过高额的 Gas Fee 或者贿赂矿工来插入一笔买单，**抢在代币价格上涨之前完成买入**。套利者的抢跑行为将导致后续的那一笔大额买单以以更高的价格成交。\n\n其实在现实世界中也有抢跑的操作，但是由于法律法规和券商的约束，我们很少在现实世界中看到抢跑的发生。\n\n### **尾随（Backrunning）**\n\n与抢跑类似，只不过这次的操作变成了紧随别人的交易。\n\n例如目前币价下跌，很多人都被套牢了。这时候突然出现一笔拉升币价的买单。那么我可以通过贿赂矿工将我的单子排在大额买单之后。具体尾随的例子可以参考 *[律动研究院的文章](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.theblockbeats.com/news/20528)*。\n\n### **三明治攻击（Sandwich Attack）**\n\n**三明治攻击 = 抢跑 + 尾随**\n\n例如套利者在内存池中发现了一笔大额买单，我们可以在这笔买单之前放置一笔买单（抢跑），在这笔买单之后放一笔卖单（尾随），形成前后夹击。\n\n由于买单会使价格上升，借助三明治攻击，套利者卖单成交价格必定高于他的买单成交价格。\n\n### **✳️ 无风险套利（搬砖）**\n\n在以太坊价格剧烈波动的时候，不同 DEX 的同种代币价格会有差距。\n\n这时候我们就可以从代币价格低的 DEX 购买代币，然后在代币价格高 DEX 卖出，利用价格差完成套利。\n\n以上说的便是几种主要的与 MEV 相关的套利方式。有人说以太坊就像一个黑暗森林，森林中一直有人在检察着我们的一举一动，假如我们发现了一个获利机会，提交了一笔交易，很有可能就被在暗中窥探的第三方发现，第三方会以更高的 Gas Fee 抢在我们前面完成交易，夺走了我们的获取利润的机会。\n\n### **相关阅读：**\n\n*   *[Flash Boys 2.0](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf)*\n*   *[Frontrunner Jones and the Raiders of the Dark Forest](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03347.pdf)*\n*   *[解析以太坊 MEV 三大阵营：它们如何扩展 MEV 疆域？](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.chainnews.com/articles/348215325346.htm)*\n*   *[一文读懂矿工可提取价值（MEV）](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//blog.chain.link/what-is-miner-extractable-value-mev-cn/)*\n*   *[Ethereum is a Dark Forest](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.google.com/url%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3D%26esrc%3Ds%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D%26ved%3D2ahUKEwj-1rbg4MrwAhUMsJ4KHbSZB1oQFjAAegQIBBAD%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmedium.com%252F%2540danrobinson%252Fethereum-is-a-dark-forest-ecc5f0505dff%26usg%3DAOvVaw3Y9nwo_FYlaOT4q6WEbGoP)*\n", "timestamp": 1633782083, "digest": "x83vNtBG3tHULEl6ZvhQx8FnFWHFvFp5BfarFG_T_BI", "contributor": "0x7B076d7BcdE88Ec322B2D01AA1ADc1997b7724f6"}
{"id": "aDuci8n78UnuCT2oTT7vPxUbPzWXT2mxhVhNlymewjQ", "title": "自动化做市商", "body": "### **两种做市商**\n\n**传统做市商**\n\n传统做市商在交易市场中扮演交易中间人的角色，他向市场同时给出买价和卖价。给出报价后，市场上的买家和卖家根据报价与做市商进行交易，买家和卖家间接完成交易。买卖交易依赖于订单簿（Order Book）来撮合，买卖双方需要将订单挂到订单簿上，以价格为信号进行交易。\n\n### **自动化做市商（Auto Market Maker）**\n\n自动化做市商（AMM）是一种去中心化的交易所（DEX）的协议，它**依靠数学公式为资产定价**。在 AMM 协议下，传统的订单簿被流动性池（Liquidity Pool）所取代；买家、买家、做市商不复存在，取而代之的是流动性提供者、交易者和套利者。\n\n### **角色**\n\n### **流动性池（Liquidity Pool）& 流动性提供者（Liquidity Provider）**\n\n流动性池和流动性提供者是紧密关联的两个概念，因此我们一并解释。\n\n流动性池可以理解为一个大池子，里面有许多的加密货币资产，流动性提供者将自己的资产注入到流动性池中，为交易提供流动性，通过交易手续费获取一定收益。任何人都可以成为流动性提供者，只要他向池子里注入了资金。\n\n### **交易者**\n\n交易者可以与流动性池发生交易，向池子中投入一种资产，以换取另一种资产，这个交换的过程需要支付交易手续费。\n\n### **套利者**\n\n套利者负责修正交易价格，以保证流动性池中的资产交易价和市场价一致，并从中套利，他们会给流动性提供者带来无常损失（Impermanent Loss）。\n\n### **运作机制**\n\n![](https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-88f34ac53900e58a17679d2678ac0434\\_b.jpg)\n\n### **流动性初始化**\n\n在交易开始前，流动性提供者向一个流动性池子的智能合约注入一定数量的两种资产（两种不同的资产可以组成一个 LP 对）例如在 ETH-UNI 池子中，就需要同时注入 ETH 与 UNI ，以作为流动性储备。\n\n注入到流动性池的两种资产的数量基于当前 AMM 下的资产交易价计算得出。假设在 ETH-UNI 的 LP 对中，当前价格：1 ETH = 100 UNI，那么流动性提供者在注入 1 ETH 的同时需要注入 100 UNI 。\n\n### **交易**\n\n我们将继续沿用上文的例子。\n\n流动性池子建好后，交易者可以向流动性池的智能合约发送交易请求，他可以放入 x 个 ETH ，换出 y 个 UNI （换出的 UNI 的数量受资产价格影响）。同时，交易者需要为它的交易付手续费。\n\n需要注意的是，交易可能会受滑点影响，交易者最终得到的 UNI 数量并可能和交易申请时的数量不一致。关于滑点，我们下次再聊。\n\n### **套利**\n\n交易者交易结束后，AMM 中的资产交易价会发生变动，与市场公允交易价有偏差，套利者可以进场购买被低估的资产或卖出被高估的资产，直到 AMM 的资产交易价与市场公允交易价匹配。\n\n### **无常损失（Impermanent Loss）**\n\n![](https://pic2.zhimg.com/v2-78cfd4d3ce22556e7e334a81da64c5ed_b.jpg)\n\n在 AMM 下，只要发生了交易，就会引起价格变动，不同市场价格之间的偏差会带来无常损失。\n\n流动性提供者为 AMM 提供流动性是为了获取交易费用，然而无常损失的存在提高了流动性提供者的投资风险。当无常损失超过了流动性收益，那么 LP 将不再提供流动性，因此无常损失的大小是决定 AMM 类 DEX 能否正常运行的关键。\n\n减少无常损失的最好解决方式是：减少 AMM 下的交易价与市场公允价之间的偏差，现行的方案有借助稳定币进行过渡交易，以及更为巧妙的**预言机**方案。预言机的作用是为智能合约提供真是准确的价格来降低价格偏差，减少无常损失（只能减少，不能消除）。\n\n### **相关阅读：**\n\n*   *[入门自动做市商 AMM：金融市场交易的范式革命](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.chainnews.com/articles/814658188591.htm)*\n*   *[什么是无常损失](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//academy.binance.com/zh/articles/impermanent-loss-explained)*\n", "timestamp": 1633782093, "digest": "Pw3VecILWUm9u3bZhrzcNPSspjTl3iZy8y426hKTnBo", "contributor": "0x7B076d7BcdE88Ec322B2D01AA1ADc1997b7724f6"}
{"id": "SZD6ukWQ8QEEi6pBhYEBwZXoCsI1Z8zp6GSUXAJTFbc", "title": "Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool", "body": "> 我们为大家介绍和分析初期区块链项目分发代币的常见方式，一起来看看新颖的 LBP 分发方式\n\n每周都有不少区块链项目上线，他们往往都有自己的代币。在项目初期，如何分发代币是一个很讲究的事情。往往越多的人拥有你的代币，代表你的代币受到更多的认可。这一期本周热点，我将为大家介绍一些常见的代币分发方式。\n\n### ⛏️ 预挖矿\n\n在项目公开分配代币之前，某些群体可以提前获得项目代币。这些群体可能是项目赞助方，项目开发者等。对于预挖矿的不公平我们不能一棒子打死，作为为项目付出的群体，他们有权利获得属于他们的利益。\n\n### Airdrop\n\n![](https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-ed649a3c414fd7df0a252f3428389fbc_b.jpg)\n\n还记得去年的 *[Uniswap 空投](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//uniswap.org/blog/uni/)*和 *[1inch 空投](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//help.1inch.io/en/articles/4747599-how-to-claim-the-community-reward-wave-2)*吗，对大部分参与到其中的人来说，空投就是天上掉馅饼。\n\n在大多数情况下，空投会将代币平分给满足条件的用户。对于 Uniswap 和 1inch，他们的要求是在某个日期前使用过他们的 APP。对于一些刚刚开始的项目，空投条件可能是 Twitter 转发，点赞，或者只是填个邮箱和钱包地址。\n\n对于用户来说，这样的空投较为容易薅羊毛，几乎没有成本。\n\n对于项目方来说空投并不能起到融资的作用，也不能真正的吸引用户。用户可能拿到空投就套现离场。但是空投是较为简单的分发代币的方式。\n\n*[这个网站](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//airdrops.io/)*整理了正在进行空投的项目。\n\n### Fair Lunch\n\nFair Lunch 的含义是每个人都有公平的机会去获得项目代币。用户需要质押指定的代币来获得项目代币。\n\n例如在 *[Mith Cash的Fair Lunch](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//medium.com/mith-cash/introducing-mithril-cash-a-new-algorithmic-stablecoin-5bb8af01c49b)* 中，160000 个项目代币将平均的作为 16 个质押池子的奖励总和。这 16 个池子分别接受 DAI，USDT，USDC，MITH，YFI，COMP 等。用户质押的代币占池子总代币比例越高，用户将获得更多的项目代币。\n\n对于用户来说，这种方式就类似流动性挖矿，通过质押代币来获取项目方代币。由于不同池子的资金量不同，因此相同的资金量选择不同的质押池子会有不同的收益率。\n\n对于大资金用户来说，他们可以轻易地获得大部分的项目代币。因此大资金用户可以一定程度上操控项目代币的价格。\n\n对于项目方来说，Fair Lunch 有助于发展自己的社区。并且项目方可以开一个 LP 代币的质押池子来提升项目代币的流动性。\n\n### ‍⚖️ 民主发行 Democratic Launch\n\nDemocratic Launch 在大部分地方和 Fair Launch相同，只是修改了以下几点：\n\n1.  考虑到大资金用户的影响，Democratic Launch 使用白名单，包含参加过其他项目社区治理的钱包地址\n2.  设有最大资金限制，杜绝大资金用户的入场\n3.  更长的发行时间。*[Float Protocol](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//medium.com/float-protocol/announcing-float-protocol-and-its-democratic-launch-d1c27bc21230)* 分为两期，一共8周\n\n### LBP: Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool\n\n![](https://pic2.zhimg.com/v2-5a9875ec2f6834e8e576f1f741ff8ba9\\_b.jpg)\n\nLBP 是一种更加巧妙地拍卖项目代币的方式。LBP 通过控制代币的市场供应来使代币市场价格接近初始拍卖价格。我们以 *[ChainSwap 的 LBP](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//chain-swap.medium.com/chainswaps-innovative-uniswap-lbp-explained-97e7a80e9590)* 为例。\n\n可以看到项目代币的市场价格越高，合约就会释放更多的项目代币。这一定程度缓解了大家抢购项目代币对价格的影响。使用LBP可以帮助代币拍卖价格一定程度靠近代币初始价格。因此在参加LBP的时候，我们需要关注初始价格是否合理。\n\n### 总结\n\n目前大多数项目都采用 Fair Launch，Democratic Launch。这两种方式对于用户来说成本更小。除了这几种常见方式，还有一些较为简单的方式没有介绍，例如直接进行拍卖，或者以特定价格预售代币等等。希望大家以后开发自己的区块链项目，能够选择最适合自己的代币分发方式。\n\n### 相关阅读：\n\n*[Balancer LBP文档](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//docs.balancer.finance/smart-contracts/smart-pools/liquidity-bootstrapping-faq)*\n", "timestamp": 1633782041, "digest": "8ncSAoGV_ghJ5VnkUTNWkHuT-k41AgneQzHi4cKZcck", "contributor": "0x7B076d7BcdE88Ec322B2D01AA1ADc1997b7724f6"}

10 = 90U）\n\n到这里为止，就是常规的担保，千年以前就有了，不是什么新东西。\n\n*❓* ***但如果这张合同可以在二级市场买卖呢？***\n\n### **故事继续**\n\n1.  李四中了 500 万彩票，张三不担心李四不还钱了\n2.  张三觉得给老娘舅的担保费（10%，10 U）有点小亏，**想要以 5% 担保费的价格卖掉这张担保合同（5 U）**，回一部分血\n3.  张三和李四共同的朋友王五出现了，王五一直觉得李四不靠谱、太张扬，迟早出事，接盘了这张担保合同（**王五付给张三 5U，得到了一张价值 100 U 的还款担保合同**；老娘舅和张三没关系了， 老娘舅现在和王五关系）\n4.  李四果真拿中的 500 万去炒原油合约了，不仅亏光了，还倒欠了 1000 万\n\n### **大结局**\n\n*   张三借出去的钱（100U）没有收回来，卖合同还继续亏了 5%（5U）。张三收益：**-105U**（借出 100，担保支出 100）\n*   李四成了老赖\n*   老娘舅把履行合约，把担保的借款全额还给了**持有担保合同的王五。**老娘舅收益：**-90U**（收入10，支出 100）\n*   王五获得本应该给张三的赔款，用 5U 赚了大钱。王五收益：**95U**（支出5，收入100）\n\n**那么，CDS 是什么？**\n\nCDS 就是上文说到的**担保合同**，王五没给李四借一分钱，最后却通过 CDS 获利。\n\n## **Yinsure.Finance**\n\n![](https://pic4.zhimg.com/v2-107946a41946f4e695fa02f6bf3d4ffb_b.jpg)\n\n*[yinsure.finance](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//yinsure.finance/)* 在承保和赔付模式上与我们上篇提到的 Nexus Mutual 没有太大的区别，都是采用承保/被保资金池 + 社区治理索赔的模式。\n\n不同之处在于，yinsure 不需要进行 KYC 就可以购买保险，也不收取 Membership 入门费。\n\n那，CDS 呢？讲了半天的 CDS 跑哪去了？\n\n### **Yinsure NFT**\n\n开头我们提到，“*[\\*yinsure.finance](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//yinsure.finance/)* 的本质是包着 NFT 外壳的 CDS“，\\*yinsure 将每一张保单都变成了 NFT ，即每一个 NFT 代币（yNFT）对应着一张特定期限和保险金额的保单，这些 NFT 保单是**可自由交易**的。\n\n怎么样，王五入场了吧\n\n用户可以在 *[OpenSea](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//opensea.io/assets/yinsurenft)*, Rarible 之类的 NFT 交易市场上交易保单，或者说是， DeFi CDS，因为此时的保险已不单纯是保险，它已经变成可以在二级市场流通的金融衍生品。\n\n![](https://pic2.zhimg.com/v2-16e8bb35d23a93b1149b82661dc6f9dd_b.jpg)\n\n这是一张 yNFT，他保护在 Balancer 上的 10 ETH 资产，2021 年 9 月 1 日过期，目前售价 0.49 ETH\n\n![](https://pic3.zhimg.com/v2-ad4fe441cc9d9184fa9b048d538bb32a_b.jpg)\n\n从交易记录我们可以看到，这张 yNFT 在 10 个月前就已经被生成了，中途经历数次转手及涨价。\n\n## **其他 DeFi 保险**\n\n*   [CertiK Shield](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//shield.certik.foundation/shield-pool-stats): 运作在 CertiK 链上的保险，保险项目为审计过的项目\n*   [Opium](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//opium.finance/): 引入二元期权、Gas 手续费期权\n*   [Nsure](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//nsure.network/%23/home): 引入资金挖矿的 DeFi 保险\n*   [InsurAce](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//app.insurace.io/Data/Insurance): 引入组合型保险\n*   [Cover](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.coverprotocol.com/): 点对点互助保平台\n\n## **结语**\n\n对比传统的中心化保险行业，DeFi 保险目前仍处于起步阶段，币价的大幅波动，安全事故的频发，让 DeFi 保险得到了更多的关注，相信 DeFi 保险将在未来的 DeFi 市场占据更大的份额。\n\nCDS 诞生于 20 世纪 90 年代，诞生后在传统金融市场发展迅速，近几年一直在信用衍生品市场扮演重要的角色。而在去中心化金融市场 DeFi，CDS 才初见雏形，未来会像传统金融的 CDS 一样大红大紫吗？\n\n或许吧，毕竟 DeFi 虽有创新，但许多的玩法和产品思路，都来源于传统金融，金融市场历史也总是相似的。\n\nDeFi 的下一个热点，会是保险吗？\n\n## **相关阅读：**\n\n*   *[DeFi insurance: Why buy coverage for your digital assets?](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//forkast.news/defi-insurance-digital-assets-coverage/%23%3A\\~%3Atext%3DLike%2520traditional%2520insurance%252C%2520DeFi%2520coverage%2Cissues%2520or%2520against%2520stablecoin%2520defaults.)*\n*   *[Decentralized Insurance — An emerging sector in DeFi](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//medium.com/%40blockchain_simplified/decentralized-insurance-an-emerging-sector-in-defi-79bd84502cab)*\n*   [DeFi 笔记：保险的我靠时刻](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//kaiyuan.io/2020/xie-gei-nu-peng-you-de-defi-bi-ji-bao-xian-de-wo-0a6d9662)\n*   [yinsure.finance: a new insurance primitive](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//medium.com/iearn/yinsure-finance-a-new-insurance-primitive-77d5d4217896)\n*   [从信用违约互换分析 yinsure 保险产品特性](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.chainnews.com/articles/495725830191.htm)\n", "timestamp": 1633782202, "digest": "6RRTl778l8udCJv0CQBZDo-IAONMWQXox6U4g4EonAs", "contributor": "0x7B076d7BcdE88Ec322B2D01AA1ADc1997b7724f6"}
{"id": "N7_VbVNQwe98BSAo1hnUmwLGUgL3Ns_lq-JdMjONAio", "title": "Gas Fee 燃油费机制", "body": "### **⛽️ 为什么需要支付 Gas Fee**\n\n在 Ethereum 网络以及其他的区块链网络，当你进行转账、通过合约发送代币或在区块链网络上进行任何其他操作的时候，你必须为该运算付费，交易的手续费以 Gas 进行计算，通过 Ether（该网络下的主代币） 支付 Gas Fee（燃油费）。一笔交易的 Gas Fee 可通过 Gas Price（油价） 和 Gas Limit（油量限制） 计算得出。\n\n### **Gas Price**\n\nGas Price（油价） 是**每单位 Gas 的价格**，它的计价单位是 Gwei（1 Gwei = 0.000000001 ETH，10 的负 9 次方）。假如 Gas Price 设定为 40，每一 Gwei 就是 0.00000040 ETH。\n\nGas Price 受网络拥挤程度的影响，当网络资源充裕的时候，Gas Price 低，交易手续费低；当网络拥挤不堪的时候，Gas Price 的价格可以飞上天，不同链的网络情况都不同，因此 Gas Price 都不一样。\n\nGas Price 的高低决定了交易被矿工打包的快慢，矿工更倾向于先打包 Gas Price 高的交易（钱能使得鬼推磨）以获取更高的挖矿收益。因此，假如你想让交易更快被执行（抢购、恐慌抛售的时候），Gas Price 越高越好，有的时候为了抢购，人们甚至付出比物品价格更高的 Gas Price 来贿赂矿工；假如你想省钱，例如朋友之间转账（不追求到账速度），你可以降低你的 Gas Price，但这样会使交易变慢，要注意的是，过低的 Gas Price 可能导致交易的失败或一直等待，阻塞后续交易。\n\n在阻塞状态下，你可以通过向自己发起一笔0元转账，指定相同的 Nonce 值，支付手续费，以消除阻塞状态。\n\n需要注意的是，在目前的机制下，交易失败，Gas Fee 是不返还的，因此切勿为了省钱设置过低的 Gas Price，这样会导致交易失败或阻塞；交易阻塞后还需要再支付一次手续费消除阻塞，得不偿失。\n\n### **Gas Limit**\n\nGas Limit（油量） 是你愿意为一笔交易花费的**最大数量的 Gas 单位**。在去中心化网络中的每一步运算都要消耗 Gas ，Gas Limit 决定了你计划使用的计算资源的上限。\n\n一般的标准交易的 Gas Limit 为 2100，假如 Gas 耗尽了，但运算未完成，交易会因为 “Out of Gas” 而失败（没油了，跑不动了）；假如运算在 Gas 耗尽前完成，已消耗的手续费会被矿工收取，未消耗的部分将不会被收取。\n\n因此，一笔交易最高被收取的手续费是 **Gas Price \\* Gas Limit**；目前 ETH 网络上每一个区块的 Gas Limit 是 15,000,000 (上段时间经过投票，从 12.5M 提升到了 15M )，区块 Gas Limit 的提升意味着每个区块能存放更多的交易内容，一定程度上降低了 Gas Price。\n\n在智能合约开发中，Gas 消耗也是需要被考虑的在内的因素（每一步运算都在烧钱），死循环、无意义的操作会导致 Gas 的浪费；代码审计中也会找出合约代码中浪费 Gas 的操作。\n\n### **Tx Fee**\n\n![](https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-b5a90d0424c79a66974a0ec16024e068\\_b.jpg)\n\n**Tx Fee = Gas \\* Gas Limit**\n\nTx Fee 就是最终消耗的交易手续费。\n\n每条链都有自己的 Sacn 工具，以 Ethereum 为例，在 *[Etherscan](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//etherscan.io/)* 上可以查看全部实时交易记录，每一条录上都记录着 Gas Price、Gas Limit、Tx Fee 等信息。\n\n### **总结**\n\nETH 网络一直以拥堵出名，UniSwap 空投派钱、CryptoKitties 游戏火热的时候 Gas Price 更是贵上天，庆幸有 ETH 的网络升级和区块 Gas Limit 的上调使 Gas Price 有所回落。相比 ETH，BSC（Binance Smart Chain）的 Gas Price 要低得多。Gas Price 也是影响用户选择使用什么网络的一个重要因素，毕竟谁也不想支付过高的交易手续费。\n\n### **相关阅读**\n\nEthereum: *[GAS AND FEES](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/)*\n\nYouTube: *[What is Ethereum Gas?](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DAJvzNICwcwc%26t%3D3s)*\n\n## **区块链开发：OpenZepplin 发布 4.1**\n\n![](https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-58d2a26068ea444872a923d4e0fe9a28\\_b.jpg)\n\n知名智能合约开发库 OpenZepplin 近日发布了 4.1 的版本更新，有如下亮点：\n\n1.  受以太坊柏林升级的影响，OpenZeppelin 用 UUPSUpgradeable 代替 Transparent Proxy 以降低 Gas。\n2.  发布 Multicall，用户可以在一笔交易中底层调用（call）个多个函数。\n3.

{"id": "niLTJ9mrgFODgCWvEJtHQzUYCvY5NrgZPTKnb8CURUA", "title": "O3 Swap", "body": "> 我们第一期讲的就是跨链协议，这一期我们为大家介绍一个好用的跨链应用 O3 Swap\n\n### **O3 产品架构**\n\n*[O3 Swap](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//o3swap.com/)* 包含钱包，流动性聚合器，跨链。这张图清楚的展示了 O3 Swap 的产品架构。最底层是 O3 Swap 已经支持和即将支持的网路。倒数第二层是流动性。第二层结算层包含聚合器和跨链流动性池子。也就是说除了跨链交易的流动性是 O3 Swap 自己的，其他交易所使用的流动性来自其他 DEX。最顶层应用层有 O3 的钱包，交易和支付服务。\n\n![](https://pic3.zhimg.com/v2-fc3af4807c52bddded26bbd512c0a986\\_b.jpg)\n\n### **跨链交易**\n\n我们将聚焦O3 Swap 的跨链部分。\n\n目前 O3 Swap 的跨链池提供以太坊，币安和火币；支持 USDT，ETH，BTC，USDC。一天总交易量在 800 万美金左右，总流动性大约 7 亿美金左右。\n\n其中流动性最高的是 USDC 池子，约为 2亿美金；APR 最高的是 USDT 池子 27.42%。\n\n我们使用 O3 Swap 进行跨链交易时感觉速度较快且交易手续费较低。具体视频教程可以参考*[这个](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D\\_5C9x65X-50%26t%3D1234s)*。\n\n### **⚙️ 跨链原理**\n\nO3 Swap 的代币和聚合器部分均已开源，并且经过了安全审计，但是跨链部分并没有详细的介绍。只有这样言语不清的几个架构图。\n\n![](https://pic4.zhimg.com/v2-627a89804cb1664bcacf1c9a6dd28bfb_b.jpg)\n\n![](https://pic2.zhimg.com/v2-34cc9da9b555911da217995b7bd811bd_b.jpg)\n\n![](https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-1f8532af93cdb466cfa49f8ee35337b0\\_b.jpg)\n\n![](https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-199fb7309d038198178e93c015840700\\_b.jpg)\n\n可以看到魔法就发生在跨链池中。比如说对于 USDT 的跨链池，用户在任意一条链上提供 USDT 流动性，就可以收获 LP。因此 O3 Swap 的跨链交易可能就是在不同的链上都有流动性池子，因此用户可以将代币从一条链里发给 O3 Swap，并从另一条链上得到新的代币。\n\n在白皮书中，O3 Swap 提到使用了 *[PolyNetwork](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.poly.network/)* 这一个跨链技术。PolyNetwork 支持 Atomic Swap。在它的白皮书中，它介绍了 DEX 这个应用场景。PolyNetwork 采用两阶段协议（Two-phase Protocol）的方式来实现 Atomic Swap。在此场景中一共有三个角色，唯一的 Poly 链，两个参与者或者说参与链（Participant Chain），以及一个 Relayer 用来在不同的链之间传递信息。每个参与者链上可能有多个 Relayer。\n\n具体的执行过程分为两个阶段。第一阶段确保交易可以在参与者链上被执行，第二个阶段确保交易的一致性即所有参与者的交易执行状态一致。\n\n第一阶段是准备阶段。 Poly Chain 让参与者准备好提交交易，并从参与者那儿获取最新的信息和状态。\n\n第二阶段是具体的执行阶段。如果第一阶段失败，那么 Poly Chain 会通知参与者回滚。如果有参与者交易执行失败，Poly Chain 也会通知所有参与者回滚。\n\n### **相关阅读**\n\n*   *[PolyNetwork 白皮书](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//poly.network/PolyNetwork-whitepaper.pdf)*\n*   *[O3 Swap 白皮书](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//docs.o3swap.com/)*\n", "timestamp": 1633782297, "digest": "9YMSu0NHkYButYhQfH-A5HftC36MCwBfVcWmwhWjEDw", "contributor": "0x7B076d7BcdE88Ec322B2D01AA1ADc1997b7724f6"}
{"id": "o0yjaplolCXvqjR6JffZ65jCYNvPUwFGRBOiu6gfLic", "title": "区块链网络扩容", "body": "> Layer2 是未来吗？\n\n### **区块链网络拥堵**\n\nEthereum 主网目前生态活跃，但因为用户和交易太多，经常造成网络拥堵、gas price 暴涨，导致交易成本剧增。简单来说就是 Ethereum 太慢、太贵啦！在理想情况下，区块链网络应该能每秒处理大量交易（交易吞吐量我们称之为 TPS），而实际情况是去中心化的 Ethereum 1.0（我们暂时不讨论 2.0）的 TPS 是 10～20，比 Visa 使用的中心化支付网络 VisaNet 20,000 的 TPS 差了一大截。\n\n为了解决拥堵问题，开发者们想出了通过扩容方案（Scaling Solution）来在确保安全可靠的前提下降低交易成本，同时提高交易处理速度。\n\n### **扩容方案**\n\n扩容方案能够在不扩大区块大小、不影响去中心化水平、不降低安全性的前提下解决网络拥堵问题。扩容方案主要有 Layer 1 和 Layer 2 两大类\n\n### **Layer 1 扩容方案**\n\nLayer 1 扩容方案比较简单，最简单的处理方案就是修改区块链的网络共识机制，例如从 POW（Proof-of-Work）转移到 POS（Proof-of-Stake），这是 Ethereum 2.0 在做的事情。共识机制的修改能带来更高的交易处理速度，同时节省挖矿资源。\n\n另一种方案是 Sharding（分片），它将交易的授权和验证工作分解成许多小的碎片，然后将小的工作任务分散到 P2P 网络中完成。利用 P2P 网络来增加节点的数量以加快交易速度。\n\n### **Sidechian 侧链解决方案**\n\n![](https://pic4.zhimg.com/v2-abf4cb150d65706ef0cc11bd8b69e4bf_b.jpg)\n\nSidechain 侧链本质上是 Layer1 和 Layer2 两种解决方的混合体，侧链和主链之间是双向关联的关系，在这种关系下，加密货币可以在有第三方信任的前提下，从主链公开转移到侧链，也可以从侧链转回主链。\n\n侧链的最经典案例就是 BSC(Binance Smart Chain) 和 Heco，但他们的发展过于迅速，带走了大量的主链用户。由于他们目前已经和 Ethereum 没有太多的交互，我们可以把它理解为一条独立的链。\n\n*[Liquid Network](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//liquid.net/)* 也是侧链的一个案例，它和比特币主链实现了双向关联\n\n### **Layer 2 扩容方案**\n\nLayer 1 是对主链本身的扩容，Layer 2 则是通过构建链下第二层网络的方式来分担主链的压力。你可以把 Layer 1 理解为拓宽城市道路，让更多的行人和汽车可以通过，而 Layer 2 就是在原有道路的基础上修建立交桥和地下隧道，来缓解交通拥挤。\n\nLayer 2 扩容方案的的赛道主要有\n\n*   Rollup\n*   Plasma\n*   状态通道（局限性大，不作解释）\n\n### **Plasma 子链解决方案**\n\n![](https://pic2.zhimg.com/v2-94bd8c61239b7638d967cef596d328c1\\_b.jpg)\n\nPlasma 子链解决方案的策略是，将主链上的运算迁移到子链上完成，运算完成后将结果加密后返回给主链。由于子链是去中心化网络，因此每隔一段时间就需要节点对该时间段内的交易进行批量确认，将确认的结果哈希处理后返回给主链，但这种批量确认需要的时间较长，效率不高。\n\nPolygon 的前身—— Matic 就是采用 Plasma 的解决方案，但由于 Plasma 的愿景难以实现，于是 Matic 团队就改变了发展策略，去做一个众多 Layer 2 的聚合器—— Polygon，目的是使各种 DApp 能在不同的 Layer 为2 网络下进行跨链交互。\n\n### **Rollup 解决方案**\n\nLayer 2 众多扩容解决方案中，最有潜力同时也是最值得期待的，就是 Rollup。Rollup 和 Plasma 略有不同，Plasma 是将运算结果加密后发送给主链，用户没有办法查看原始的交易数据；Rollup 是将线下的交易数据全部打包压缩后发布至主链，用户可以在主链上解压，查看每一条交易信息。\n\n目前 Rollup 的主要方向是 ZK Rollup（零知识证明）和 Optimistic Rollup，这两个方向我们在以前的周报已经介绍过了，大家可以自由阅读：\n\n*   *[un.Block 区块链周报 #7](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//unblock256.substack.com/p/unblock-2021-7truebit)*\n*   *[un.Block 区块链周报 #8](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//unblock256.substack.com/p/unblock-2021-8arbitrumsafemoon)*\n\n### **相关阅读**\n\n*   *[What Is a Scaling Solution?](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/scaling-solution)*\n*   *[What Is a Layer-1 Blockchain?](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain)*\n*   *[What Is Layer 2?](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2)*\n*   *[What Is Polygon?](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-polygon-matic)*\n*   *[Ethereum's Layer 2: The Story So Far And What To Expect Next](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//hackernoon.com/ethereums-layer-2-the-story-so-far-and-what-to-expect-next-kn41342c)*\n", "timestamp": 1633782305, "digest": "Uommb93_K8y371Lapwk4ZiK0yoO2dip-tkCHoOH3ULA", "contributor": "0x7B076d7BcdE88Ec322B2D01AA1ADc1997b7724f6"}

{"id": "A76zHnqJjP3zzua5CTaMyOCXrZmFkukZdmRkNfuntJ8", "title": "浅谈 DeFi 借贷", "body": "> 忠告：借錢梗要還、咪俾錢中介\n\n最近关于借贷市场的新闻挺多的，上周有因 BetaFinance 上线 Binance LaunchPad（需要持有 BNB 来获取配额），导致各大平台 BNB 借贷利率暴涨；这周有 Geist Finance 上线 Fantom，提供高额的借贷奖励，TVL 迅速攀升。\n\n今天我们就来讲一下关于 DeFi 借贷的基本知识（以下全部内容都是非投资建议，加密货币投资具有高风险）\n\n![](https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-1e46c53288a38b14b65f8f07a74ceb7c_b.jpg)\n\n在链下世界，我们如果去借钱，借贷关系是 P2P（点对点关系） 的，通常都需要和贷方签订借贷合同，合同上会写清楚借贷的时间，利率。理论上，我们需要按期还款并支付利息，逾期不还则会被催债甚至遭受信用危机。\n\n但在链上，借贷关系并不是点对点的。大部分项目都采取 “资金池” 的方式解决资金流动性的问题，我们的借和贷，都是和资金池进行交互。借和贷的需求通过智能合约进行撮合，无需签订合约。\n\n*   「放贷人」，可以随时将闲置资金投入资金池，获取放贷利息收益，可以在任意的时候将资金取回\n*   「借款人」，可以随时从资金池中借出资金，在任意时候进行还钱并支付利息\n*   借贷平台将根据资金池里的资金情况，实时动态调整存款利率和借款利率\n\n和传统借贷相比，DeFi 借贷更灵活、使用起来更方便快捷，它大大地促进了 DeFi 世界的资金利用率。\n\n![](https://pic3.zhimg.com/v2-99aed2a84970a2b71066334d395e14ca_b.jpg)\n\n## **DeFi 借贷中的操作**\n\nDeFi 借贷主要有这么几个关键事件：存入、取回、借入、还贷、清算、利率更新，下面我们将为大家逐一讲解\n\n### **存入**\n\n存入是使用借贷服务的第一步，也是最基础的一步。我们将闲置资金投入借贷池，可以得到**凭证代币**，凭证代币就是我们权益证明，**凭证代币丢失，我们就无法取回资金**。同时，凭证代币是我们进行借入操作所需要的抵押物。\n\n### **取回**\n\n取回，是存入的逆操作，当我们想从资金池中撤出资金时，向借贷池提供我们的凭证代币，就可以得到当初存入的资金和利息收益。\n\n### **借入**\n\nDeFi 世界暂时不存在信用贷款，借入资金前，我们需要提前存入资金。我们可以通过抵押凭证代币，来借出同类或其他类型的代币。不同类型的代币，根据价值和流动性，会有不同的**最大抵押率**与**清算阈值。**\n\n*   最大抵押率：最大可借出资产 / 抵押物价值，例如 ETH 的最大抵押率是 80%，我们存入 10 ETH 作为抵押，就可以借出 8 ETH 等值的同类或其他代币\n*   清算阈值：抵押物面临被清算的门槛比率，通常清算阈值会高于最大抵押率，当抵押物价值下跌，或借出代币价值上涨，导致抵押率超过清算阈值，就会触发清算机制。例如 ETH 的最大抵押率是 80%，清算阈值是 90%，我们存入了 10 ETH 作为抵押，借出了 8 ETH 等价值的 BTC，当借出 BTC 价格上涨至等于 9 ETH，或 ETH 价格不断下跌，借贷抵押率突破 90%，我们抵押的 10 ETH 就会被清算。\n\n### **还贷**\n\n还贷是借入的逆操作，我们需要支付我们当时借出的代币，并支付相应利息，就可以取回我们当时质押的凭证代币，然后取回我们当时的抵押资产。\n\n### **清算**\n\n关于 DeFi 借贷，还有一个健康系数需要关注，它代表了我们账户目前的健康状态，如果健康系数低于 1，就会面临清算\n\n**健康系数 = ∑(抵押物\\*清算阈值)/(借款额+借款利息)**\n\n当抵押率突破清算阈值，我们的抵押资产就会面临清算危机，部分抵押资产将会被低价拍卖，用户提高账户的健康系数，从而避免全部资产被清算。\n\n清算是为了避免系统性金融风险的发生，借款人将受到惩罚，清算人将获得奖励，清算人可以以低价购入高价值代币，进行套利操作。\n\n### **利率更新**\n\nDeFi 借贷的利率是实时更新的，存入、取回、借入、还贷、清算操作，都会导致利率的波动。和传统借贷的稳定利率不同，DeFi 借贷的利率是浮动的。当然，也有借贷平台尝试基于过去的借贷利率，结合资金池的资金状况，给出某一周期内的“稳定利率”。\n\n## **结语**\n\n以上就是传统借贷和 DeFi 借贷的区别，以及 DeFi 借贷中的一系列关键操作。上述的许多内容都可以开展进一步的分析和学习，感兴趣的读者可以自行了解，我们也会在后期文章中更深入的讲解关于借贷的知识。\n\n## **相关阅读**\n\n*   *[HOW DOES DEFI LENDING WORK?](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.leewayhertz.com/how-defi-lending-works/)*\n*   *[详解DeFi 借贷系统的技术原理](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/351383037)*\n", "timestamp": 1633782440, "digest": "7EvEKNC6PmOkZtS6zzQDkT6YIR9OFFyIvXqz5vbx3B0", "contributor": "0x7B076d7BcdE88Ec322B2D01AA1ADc1997b7724f6"}

{"id": "OM1cwfoiXJ444zfLPUnjZwfSQbQ35nvAdMIK32XlBTg", "title": "时间锁与多签名钱包", "body": "> 我们在合约中的资产真的安全吗？\n\n### **⚠️ 中心化风险**\n\n很多时候，我们都能看到由中心化风险的智能合约，这类智能合约通常存在一个管理员 owner ，管理员有权执行一些关键性的操作，例如调整资金费率，但他也可以执行危险的操作，例如从合约中抽取资金。这样的一个管理员就像双刃剑，他可以更好的管理合约内资产，但他也能够窃取我们在合约中的资产，一旦不被限制的管理员作恶，或是密钥被盗，后果将不堪设想。\n\n因此，我们应该采取一些手段来限制管理员的关键操作，保护我们珍贵的代币。\n\n### **时间锁**\n\n![](https://pic4.zhimg.com/v2-4ea784d7484223d488b8a58fc9ae7fd7\\_b.jpg)\n\n时间锁是在合约代码层面上限制管理员的关键操作，给用户足够的反应时间来应对突发的危机，如 rug 和代币盗窃。\n\n假如没有 TimeLock 机制，管理员的各种操作会被马上执行，TimeLock 机制但出现，将一项操作分成了两个阶段：等待和执行。\n\n我们以 *[Compound](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/Timelock.sol)* 的 TimeLock 作为分析例子\n\n当管理员想执行一项新的操作时（有新的 transaction），操作会被加入到等待队列中\n\n![](https://pic2.zhimg.com/v2-ce162d24327e4a99b7bea57ff792a26d_b.jpg)\n\n在这个函数中 eta 代表了预期执行的区块时间， eta 必须大于当前时间 + 时间锁的延迟时间，换句话说，操作要等到 eta 后才能执行。\n\n时间锁结束后，管理员就可以执行相应的操作。\n\n![](https://pic2.zhimg.com/v2-5e91078d2377b7aac3fc03870f5ed25d_b.jpg)\n\n在执行操作前，函数会对操作的哈希值进行检查，确保即将执行的操作是已经存在于队列中的，以防暗渡陈仓；同时会检查当前时间是否已经过了解锁时间，然后再执行操作。\n\n假如这一项操作是 rug，或者跑路，由于时间锁的存在，这些危险操作无法立即被执行。时间锁给用户争取了宝贵的资金撤离时间。\n\n## **多签名钱包**\n\n通常，我们使用的钱包都是单签名钱包，执行操作前只需要我们本人进行签名批准。但对于管理员来说，单签名钱包是危险的，万一密钥泄漏，黑客可以使用管理员钱包进行各种可怕的操作，对项目造成重大损失。\n\n多签名钱包可以防止灾难的发生，即使黑客盗取了其中一个管理员的钱包密钥，但他也难以开展盗窃行动。\n\n多签名钱包有以下特点：\n\n*   所有管理员都能看到钱包资金和全部交易记录\n*   执行操作需要至少一个或多个管理员的签名许可，这是多签名机制的核心\n*   每个管理员都有独特的助记词，一个管理员的助记词丢失，可能造成签名不足的情况，操作无法执行\n\n多签名钱包的机制有许多种，比较下面我们和大家分享比较简单的两种：\n\n1.  **3-3 钱包**：由 3 个（或多个）管理员共同管理，每一项操作都需要 3 个管理员（全部管理员）共同签名。这种机制是最安全的，但使用较为麻烦，要求每个管理员都保管好密钥\n2.  **2-3 钱包**：由 3 个（或多个）管理员共同管理，每一项操作都需要 2 个以上的管理员（过半数管理员）共同签名。这类机制更为灵活，不需要全部管理员的签名也能执行操作，但安全性不如第一种\n\n## **结语**\n\n在进行 DeFi 投资前，我们鼓励大家去浏览一下合约代码，检查是否存在中心化风险，是否存在时间锁的机制来防止危险操作，以及项目方的管理员钱包是否安全，是不是多签名钱包。简单的安全检查可能会耗费你的时间和精力，但别忘了，这关乎着你的巨额资产。\n\n### **相关阅读：**\n\n*   *[Compound 的 TimeLock 代码](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/Timelock.sol)*\n*   *[What is a Multisignature (Multisig) or Shared Wallet?](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032618692-What-is-a-Multisignature-Multisig-or-Shared-Wallet-)*\n", "timestamp": 1633782361, "digest": "ZY8FipLoK7ilmvqVGU3BeRy5-NbZ7jDmweWPU-GuZh4", "contributor": "0x7B076d7BcdE88Ec322B2D01AA1ADc1997b7724f6"}

{"id": "skirzrU5HkiexwV9V1RVrV6iyHl5WC-8jw3ndre-ei0", "title": "ERC1155 - NFT 和标准代币共存", "body": "> ERC721 做不到的，ERC1155 可以\n\n### ERC1155 的独特之处\n\nERC1155 的独特之处在于它使用一次性通过一个智能合约来代表多种代币。\n\nERC1155 的 `balanceOf` 函数和 ERC20 与 ERC777 的有所不同，他有一个独特的 `id` 参数来代表你想查询的代币，就像 ERC721 一样。\n\n但实际上 ERC1155 又与 ERC 721 略有不同：\n\n*   在 ERC721 中，`id` 和余额是无关，每一个代币都是 **Non-Fungible** 的，存在或不存在。ERC721 的 `balanceOf` 函数代表的是一个钱包里有多少个不同的代币，而不是每个不同的代币有多少。\n*   在 ERC1155 中， `id` 与余额有关，我们可以知道每种代币的数量，NFT 也是其中的一种代币\n\n得益于这种设计思路，当我们需要多种代币的时候，能够大大的节省 gas（例如你要做一个炉石传说的 NFT，里面有各种卡牌），借助 ERC 1155，我们能够地轻易的搭建整个生态系统。\n\n### 批量化操作\n\n由于全部状态都存在一个合约中，因此我们可以在一笔交易中进行多项代币操作，这样效率可以大大提高。\n\n*   `balanceOfBatch` 一次性查询多个代币的余额\n*   `safeBatchTransferFrom` 一次性转账多种代币\n\n### 实现 ERC1155 的 NFT 和标准代币共存\n\n在 ERC1155 中，一切都以代币形式存在，NFT 是存量为 1 的代币，独一无二；标准代币是存量大于 1 的代币。\n\n要达成上述目标，我们只需要修改在调用 `_mint` 函数是传入不同的数量参数，NFT 传入 1，标准代币传入大于 1 的数字。\n\n我们先来看下`_mint` 函数：\n\n![](https://pic4.zhimg.com/v2-fe1438261d6364535a9112c75240dc57\\_b.jpg)\n\n*   `account`: 代币存放地址\n*   `id`: 代币序号\n*   `amount`: 代币数量（关键点）\n*   `data`: 额外数据\n\n然后我们来看看 OpenZepplin 给的示范代码：\n\n![](https://pic4.zhimg.com/v2-200430bfc4f9175bc854361a2c26b337\\_b.jpg)\n\n在上述代码中，我们可以看到 `GOLD`、`SILVER` 并不唯一，属于标准代币，而 `THOR_HAMMER` 只有 1 把，属于 NFT 代币。通过控制存量，我们就能实现 NFT 和标准代币的共存。\n\n还有一个值得注意的地方就是：在 ERC1155 中是不存在小数的，因此每一个代币都是独立不能分割的单位。\n\n### 相关阅读：\n\n*   *[EIPS-1155](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.notion.so/un-Block-2021-17-Hermez-ERC1155-35dfc122b2554ddd96824207fd17878d)*\n*   *[OpenZepplin: ERC1155](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc1155)*\n*   *[Token Standards: ERC20 vs ERC721 vs ERC1155](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//medium.com/coinmonks/token-standards-erc20-vserc721-vs-erc1155-3106f1e3f2f3)*\n", "timestamp": 1633782344, "digest": "JZo_LtPasWfel1oGVTaObXN3bmKYWok0UlmcphIM_pQ", "contributor": "0x7B076d7BcdE88Ec322B2D01AA1ADc1997b7724f6"}
{"id": "VEjfjlkh_VFgz0D460viM9GF_F-74UGp7xUTjdwgdVg", "title": "Flow", "body": "> 随着 NFT 和 Gamefi 的热度上升，这期我们为大家介绍 Flow - 专为 NFT 和游戏设计的一条链。\n\nFlow 是 CryptoKitties 的开发团队专为游戏和 NFT 设计的一条公链。目前公链上有 NBA Top Shot，育碧 等项目。\n\n### **处理速度**\n\nFlow 采用多角色的架构来提高处理速度。相较于常见的 Layer2，分片。Flow 认为分片使智能合约间的交互更加复杂，容易出错，损害可组合性，无法保证对事物状态的 ACID（原子性，一致性，隔离性和持久性） 的要求。\n\nFlow 意识到验证节点处理不同任务的速度是不一样的。于是他们将验证节点的职责细分，让部分验证节点专注于一小部分的任务。\n\nFlow 将任务分为非确定性任务和确定性任务。\n\n*   非确定性任务需要更少的计算资源，例如确定区块链中的交易是否存在以及他们的顺序\n*   确定性任务需要更多的计算资源，例如计算交易结果\n\n这样的任务的划分实际上是将计算任务和共识分开。\n\n![](https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-7bf9ff669f7ff6a795422722e0d558dc_b.jpg)\n\n如上图所示，Flow 一共设置了 4 个角色：\n\n*   共识节点：确定交易的存在性以及顺序\n*   验证节点：监督执行节点\n*   执行节点：执行交易相关的计算\n*   收集节点：增强 Dapp 的网络连接和数据可用性\n\n共识节点所采用的是 Libra 使用的权益证明算法 *[HotStuff](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//tokens-economy.gitbook.io/consensus/chain-based-pbft-and-bft-based-proof-of-stake/hotstuff)* 的变体\n\n![](https://pic4.zhimg.com/v2-46ddbee37c91a4e9e8a4f9d5987200bb_b.jpg)\n\n### **开发**\n\nFlow 采用了 *[Cadence](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//play.onflow.org/)* 作为它的智能合约编程语言。Cadence 使用面向资源的编程范式。资源指的是具有可编程性的安全数字资产。面向资源的编程范式给予开发者创建独一无二耐用数字资产的能力。资产的所有权则由语言本身追踪。这些特性听起来是专为 NFT 和游戏等特别专注于资产所有权的应用量身打造的。\n\n在采用面向资源编程之前，Flwo 认为现有的编程环境可以追踪资产所有权，但是不能直接定义所有权。然而区块链公链就应该是为了管稀有资产的所有权。\n\n以下这个例子应该可以让各位读者进一步了解面向资源的概念。\n\n![](https://pic2.zhimg.com/v2-171486a3f64be6c0303f20d1226da281\\_b.jpg)\n\n上图是 CryptoKitty 合约的一个示例图。在使用 EVM 的以太坊上，所有的 Kitty 都存储在一个合约里面。想要知道谁拥有某只 Kitty，我们就要查询这个合约里的一个字典。想要更改某只 Kitty 的所有权，我们需要在这个合约里面进行更改。\n\n![](https://pic2.zhimg.com/v2-c560eb9702a06a398d45ef0275745d4d_b.jpg)\n\n上图是面向资源的一个例子。我们使用 resource 对象来表示 Kitty。Kitty 直接存储在拥有者的账号里。这就更像是现实世界，拥有者直接拥有 Kitty，而不是得去一个中心化的机构进行查询所有权。\n\n除了 Cadence，Flow 还提供 Flow Go SDK，Flow JS SDK，VSC 插件，Flow Playground GUI，*[FTs](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//github.com/onflow/flow-FT)* 和 *[NFTs](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//github.com/onflow/flow-FT)* 两个标准。\n\nFlow 的另一个特色便是智能合约的可升级性。开发者能够以测试状态部署智能合约，并允许逐步升级。在最后，开发者可以选择发布正式版，并放弃合约控制权。发布正式版后，代码将完全不能篡改。\n\n为了方便用户使用，Flow 支持 *[Ramp](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//ramp.network/buy/%3FdefaultAsset%3DUSDC)*。用户可以在 Ramp 上购买 Flow 网络的 fUSD。\n\n**总结**\n\n相比上周令人眼前一亮的三链架构，Flow 采用了多角色模型来保证交易速度，并采用面向资源的编程范式。我们可以明显感受到 Avalanche 和 Flow 是为了不同的目的而进行设置的。\n\n**相关阅读：**\n\n*   *[Flow 入门必读](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//zh.onflow.org/primer)*\n*   *[Flow：为消费 Z 世代而生的高性能公链](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.chainnews.com/articles/893535894772.htm)*\n*   *[HotStuff: BFT Consensus in the Lens of Blockchain](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//arxiv.org/abs/1803.05069)*\n*   *[Resource-Oriented Programming](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//medium.com/dapperlabs/resource-oriented-programming-bee4d69c8f8e)*\n*   *[Resource-Aware Session Types for Digital Contracts](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.cs.cmu.edu/\\~balzers/publications/digital_contracts_as_session_types.pdf)*\n", "timestamp": 1633782371, "digest": "_iJgl6KjVtwCw4JPCQo-3kpZTwj_AOEX062k6rflvmU", "contributor": "0x7B076d7BcdE88Ec322B2D01AA1ADc1997b7724f6"}

or False是行为准则，“代码不禁皆可为”是信条。第一性原理是最高指导思想。何为第一性原理？亚里士多德：在任何一个系统中，存在第一性原理，它是一个基本的命题或假设，不能被忽略，也不能被违反。第一性原理背后有三大哲学基石，分别是理念论、简一律和第一因。\n\n \n\n**理念论**：\n\n第一性原理源于柏拉图的理念论：世界的背后是不变的理念。古希腊哲人说：你所看到的都是流变的“假象”，真正不变的是事物背后的支配力量，某种恒定的，不可分的“本体”。第一性原理就是事物的本体、本质、本性，是事物背后的支配理念，而不是现象层面流变的物质。第一性原理必须是抽象的理念，没有掺杂物质的纯粹形式，把一切具体现象抽离出去，得到一个抽象的总结，之后再检验和应用于具体现象。一旦在逻辑上导通一个共同的抽象概念，于此相关的所有具象问题，立即全部化解。比如说，乔布斯的第一性原理是“产品之上”吗？不是，这是在现象层面的多因素比较。他曾经说过，人们根本不知道自己想要什么样的产品。确实，人生中，不知道自己到底想要什么的人比比皆是。“简洁”理念才是乔布斯的第一性原理。\n\n \n\n**简一律**：\n\n真正理性化思想系统，一般都会运行在一条基本原理上，可以把它归结为一个极简约的概念，愈高深者一定愈简洁。追本溯源的话，世界在本原上一定是极简单的。简单就是坚实和美，复杂反而是脆弱和震荡。简一律不是现象层面的“减法”而是破除现象深入本质的“除法”，第一性原理必须符合简一律，凡是不符合简一律的就不是第一性原理，如果不能找到那个“一”，就是在现象层面的分类归纳而已。比如达尔文进化论的第一性原理：自然选择。\n\n \n\n**第一因**：\n\n宇宙中的第一因就是“奇点”，第一因必须是动力因：宇宙中的任何一个特定的运动都是由其他运动产生的，而第三个运动又是由第二个运动产生的；既然不能无限倒退，就必然要有一个不动的施动者作为这一系列运动的“第一因”。\n\n找到第一性原理就像是找到支配事物运动的发动机，第一性原理是自变量，其他是因变量。第一性原理建立于不证自明的逻辑奇点或基石假设之上，亦可建立于其他已被证明的原理之上，它是自确定的元起点，是所有其他逻辑模型的基石原理，找到第一性原理，也就找到了钥匙（静鱼的知识星球起名“金 钥 匙”的由来）。\n\n芒格：在商界有条非常有用的古老守则。它分两步：1、找到一个简单的、基本的道理；2、非常严格的按照这个道理行事。很多伟人在某个系统之内都有自己的第一性原理。\n\n同样地，币圈科学家也必须要有自己的第一性原理，那就是：通过解锁要素去解锁，然后蜂群攻之。如何解读呢？这与芒格在商界遵循的古老守则比较接近。在币圈，项目方设置的一把把锁是专门防机器人和科学家的。常人思维解锁要用钥匙。实际上开锁用钥匙只不过是“表象”或者“假象”。钥匙只不过是基于解锁原理而击中开锁的要素，从而解锁。钥匙可以千变万化、花样百出，但本质地，不变的是解锁原理，解锁原理才是解锁的根本。原理由一个个组成要素相互作用而来。\n\n对某一事件事物充分认知就是对其构成要素进行切割，逐一解剖各个要素的属性，功能及其相互作用，然后对其进行演绎推导。这就是科学精神。科学精神是求知、探索，所以必须要保持客观理性。从千变万化的数据中抽丝剥茧是窥探真相，发现规律的必要途径。\n\n科学精神是科学生产的前提。科学生产要做到因地制宜、统一部署，合理排产，做到小投入，高产出。因地制宜要充分分析大盘环境、项目所处赛道、发展阶段、项目方背景等因素。 统一部署指将工作重心优先安排在哪个热点、哪个赛道、哪个项目抑或是多热点、多赛道均匀布局、作战，做到合理分配时间，分配资源，从而合理排产。要想小投入，高产出就要计算预期投入与可能产出比例。不符合作战标准的坚决不碰。零撸也是有时间成本的。所谓：时间就是金钱，币圈一天，人间一年。\n\n前阵子，Beeple在佳士得拍卖行进行The First 5000 Days的在线拍卖，起拍价为100美元，经过220次拍卖后，最终成交价约合6930万美元，创下数字艺术品拍卖的世界纪录。这次成功拍卖被看作是数字艺术发展的分水岭。虽然我们无法直接参与这些世界纪录，但是我们可以通过持有B20代币间接参与这些圈内的重要历史事件（B20是The Beeple 20系列艺术品的所有权代币）。之后，Blackpool发布治理代币BPT，对持有B20代币的地址进行空投，每个地址空投约100美金。这种持有历史性事件的代币布局空投的成本非常低，没有持有金额要求，成本就是花点手续费分发代币而已。几乎没有时间成本的支出。这种布局符合币圈科学家的第一性原理，产出率非常高。\n\nCryptopunks在NFT领域中的地位相当于BTC在数字代币中的地位。假如花100多万持有Cryptopunk为了布局的话，投入与产出差太远了。而且，无法介入蜂群策略，那很不科学。不过，近期，104个punks的碎片化通证FLOOR要来了。\n\n科学生产，刨根问底，究其本源，庙算而后战，杜绝被反撸。\n\n \n\n**高效生产**\n\n \n\n生产工具决定生产力。正解，生产工具的确是币圈科学家追求高效率的必杀器。正所谓：工欲善其事必先利其器。那么，币圈科学家常用的工具都有哪些呢？下面这些都是。\n\n一、模拟器（多开同步群控N个安卓手机系统，N个代表N倍生产力）\n\n二、虚拟机（多开同步群控N个电脑系统，N个代表N倍生产力）\n\n三、云服务器（CVM、ECS）：多开，群控，套娃（高性能套轻量、通用版）解决因配置限制引起的卡顿问题，独立IP，不用\\*\\*），选择香港或者新加坡的服务器，自带属地公网IP，免\\*\\*。国内的有最长3个月的免费使用期；付费的每台每月也就几十块钱。最便宜的也就10多块/台/月。N台代表N倍生产力。\n\n四、同步器（一套键盘鼠标同时同步群控N部手机或N台电脑）\n\n五、远程管理工具（批量群控同步N台电脑、服务器或系统）\n\n六、脚本软件（替代重复劳动，集群快速抢占先机，程序总是比人工快得多）\n\n七、IP限制解决方案：服务器、IP代理和软路由  （全局代理、进程代理、独享、包机、单窗口单IP、一拖N）\n\n八、指纹浏览器（多IP多账号方案）\n\n九、批量工具（分发、领取、归集、挂单等）\n\n十、集线器+N台手机（群控同步N台手机）\n\n十一、云手机平台（群控同步N台云手机）\n\n十二、物料合集（推特号、电报号、Discord号、钱包地址、邮箱、接码平台、打码平台、身份生成器等等，免费用的美国手机号Google Voice，等等）\n\n十三、定制多开主机+虚拟机+同步器\n\n十四、应用多开（免费无限分身）\n\n十五、网络爬虫【Python】信息收集与提取。\n\n十六、合约调用与外部继承【Solidity】\n\n十七、数据抓包【黑客常用技术之一】工具：Fiddler、httpCanary等，通过抓包改包达到攻击目的。\n\n十八、跑字典【暴力破解手段】黑客常用，币圈科学家几乎很少用。24位助记词的钱包比12位助记词的钱包更能对抗暴力破解。\n\n十九、情报平台：（信息收集）社群、推特、电报、Discord、Medium、Decrypt、Reddit、论坛、微博、钱包快讯、圈内媒体、星球、芥末圈等等。\n\n \n\n币圈科学家神秘吗？一点也不，只是人们的认知自我蒙蔽而已。你眼中不可能的“神话”在高维认知下只不过是一个个普普通通的要素构成的必然事件而已。在这里，我推荐大家观看《天道》这部电视剧。相信这部电视剧让大家对事物的认知很有裨益。平时，我们在生活或工作上遇到很多棘手问题就犹如我们上高楼，一步一步爬楼梯真的很费劲、很低效、很辛苦，乘坐电梯却可以一键直达。但乘坐电梯并不需要你要学会制造电梯。事实上，有了电梯后，大楼却可以不断构建出新的高度，由零星的五六层小高楼到遍地摩天大楼拔地而起。这就是生产工具带来的根本性革命。\n\n思维工具是生产工具中的核弹。\n\n影响命运的只有技术、制度与文化，大到国家、民族，小到家庭、个人。不同命运产生的问题都可以从技术、制度与文化里找到答案。弱势文化造就弱者，强势文化造就强者。强势文化是一种植根于自力更生，自强不息，在事物规律内办事情的方法论与思维方式。其要求以自然规律，社会规律为基础规范人的行为来做事情。强者不立于不毛之地，不做撒哈拉海盗。毫无疑问，币圈科学家位于强者之列。但币圈科学家也会遇到很多技术上暂时解决不了的问题。比如，币圈最常见的有些封号问题。电报、Discord或者推特临时不够用或者被封号？如何解决呢？升维认知与行动能突破技术之墙。万物不为我所有，万物皆为我所用。我没有的，不代表我不能用。技术与升维认知相结合，可以通过技术手段解决的用技术手段，推特的封号技术既然无法用更先进的技术手段破解的话，那完全可以用升维认知突破困境。不过物料还是得准备充分的，缺乏物料，巧妇也难为无米之炊。毕竟，道与术相辅相成，相克相生。不是所有人都能及时切换更高的思维武器把握市场先机。\n\n技术是把双刃剑，切莫精于术而荒于道。顶级的币圈科学家是能够洞悉万物规则，在规则之内任意行走，找到规则交互之间的瞬间机会，甚至能主动引起规则的相互冲突从而火中取栗。规则是人定的，法则是天定的。大道至简，大象无形，无中生有，无极太极，两仪万物，阴阳互化，规则定生杀。形形色色，百态万象，不离其宗，一通百通。悟透悟彻，做人做事，可收可放，可攻可守。\n\n天道不可违，人道不宜荒。剩下的个人的意志在时间、空间和道的金刚齿轮相互传动下，犹若微尘。你不主动，就得被动。\n\n高效生产，循道而行，依势而动，经纬万物，刚柔相济，万物可得。\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n**安全生产**\n\n俗语说：小心驶得万年船。尤其在币圈。币圈，遍地是机会，也遍地是陷阱。如果不重视安全生产问题，那产出再多的资产也只是竹篮打水，成了过眼财富，帮高维猎食者提供佳肴。那么，如何做到安全生产呢？首先，得善用安全工具。\n\n一、密码管理器：\n\n原理：用一个主密码来保存其他所有密码。设置一个复杂的密码，经常变更主密码。\n\n \n\n1Password（年费200多）：一款跨平台密码管理应用，包含密码管理器与浏览器扩展两个部分。算是密码管理软件中用户评价最高的。30天免费使用，个人版每月2.99美元，家庭版每月4.99美元，可5人使用。一个账号可以在多个平台登录进行同步使用。\n\n \n\nLastPass（有免费版本）：一款优秀的在线密码管理密码管理器和页面过滤器，浏览器里使用功能更加强大。最大的优势是跨浏览器平台。基础版免费；付费版每月3美元，按年支付。\n\n \n\nEnpass（PC端免费）：手机端可以免费显示20个密码项目。专业版一次性支付11.99美元在单个系统终身使用，不同系统需要另行购买。可设置自动上锁，防止离开后他人打开查看。\n\n \n\nKeePass(开源免费）：开源，全平台支持，完全免费。数据储存在自己本地数据库，不用担心官方服务器安全问题。支持主密码、密钥文件、Windows用户账户，三种方式可以叠加使用，专业性较强，不容易操作。\n\n \n\nXyKey(6-13元）:一款简洁易用的账号密码管理工具，属于小众的轻量级软件，没有太多复杂的操作和功能，也没有联网权限，所以密码没有在其他服务器里备份，安全掌握在你自己手中。备份和导出也很简单，采用文本的方式。\n\n \n\n花密：一款非存储式密码管理软件。它的特点是不管云端还是本地都没有记录你的密码，而是一种密码的计算生成方法。\n\n \n\n总结：\n\n1、如果想获得最便捷的设置体验，且不在乎价格的话，那么可以选择1Password;\n\n2、如果不想花钱，又想全平台使用的，不怕麻烦，愿意手动设置的可以选择KeePass;\n\n3、主要仅用于电脑端，移动端没有强烈要求，另外不想付费，希望设置起来相对便捷的，可以选择Enpass;\n\n4、主要用于网页端自动登录，愿意花点钱的，可以选择LastPass;\n\n5、不想花钱，对密码要求不是非常高，可以选择花密。\n\n \n\n二、硬件钱包：\n\n硬件钱包是对数字资产管理和保护的硬件设备，将数字资产私钥单独储存在一个安全芯片中，与网络隔离。硬件钱包属于冷钱包，因其不触网，从而杜绝了黑客通过网络获取私钥的入侵方式，是目前最为安全的管理和保护数字资产的方式之一。常见硬件钱包有：\n\n \n\nLedger：部分代码开源，深耕行业多年，支持多链多币种，支持Defi,无法管理一串不同的钱包地址，储存空间太小，适合专业用户。\n\n \n\nTrezor：所有代码开源，行业最老，测试最久。无限创建硬件地址，交易费用低，支持多链多币种，多一个隐藏词，这个词可以保证，就算钱包遗失，别人也无法动你的资产。这个词可以衍生出很多绝密的子钱包，支持Defi,适合专业用户。\n\n \n\nHyperMate:慢雾科技、知道创宇审计，国人硬件钱包。\n\n \n\nImkey：Imtoken钱包出品。\n\n \n\n比特护盾：比特派团队出品，还可以当手表使用，老牌子。\n\n \n\nOnekey：开源多链多币种硬件钱包，支持浏览器插件，性价比高，比较适合国人使用。目前有个众筹活动，是个埋伏空投的机会。\n\n \n\nKeyPal：TokenPocket钱包出品，新出品的硬件钱包。目前是预售阶段。\n\n \n\nKeepKey、Cobo、库神等等。\n\n \n\n三、二次验证器：\n\n我们常常会见到“两步验证”、“二步验证”、“双因素验证”、“多因素验证”、“虚拟 MFA”、“动态令牌”、“双重验证”、“2FA”、“Two-Factor Authentication”、“Multi-Factor Authentication”、“OTP”、“TOTP”等等词语，不过你完全不需要被吓到。因为其实它们都是在说同一个意思，就是除帐号密码这一个因素以外，再多增加一个要验证的因素。实现形式可以是用手机短信、邮件来发送验证码，也可以是基于时间生成“不断变化”的一次性数字验证码。常见二次验证器如下：\n\n \n\nAuthy：最好的二步验证密码生成器/身份验证器应用。它完全免费，全平台通用，支持 iOS / Android / Windows / macOS 系统，提供 Chrome 的浏览器插件，而且可以备份数据，并支持跨设备同步，可以一 APP 通行全部支持 TOTP 两步验证的网站。\n\n \n\n1Password：1Password可以说是最出色的跨平台密码管理器，唯一的缺点就是稍贵。它除了支持帐号密码管理以及自动填写密码等功能以外，新版本同样「也可以支持一次性密码 (TOTP 两步验证码)」，数据可以云端同步，使用上非常方便，据说就连苹果也为员工统一配备此 APP。\n\n \n\nMicrosoft Authenticator:顾名思义，这个就是由微软开发的两步验证器应用，完全免费，跨平台支持 iOS 和安卓，界面简约。新版本增加了数据备份功能，因此也是一个不错的选择。\n\n \n\nGoogle 身份验证器:免费、Google 的影响力大、并且它出现得比较早而且。它的缺点非常明显——不支持数据备份！也就是说，如果手机丢失或刷机清空数据后，你的网络账号就麻烦了 (因为你必须使用原来设置两步验证时留存的备用码进行恢复)。而 Authy 或 1Password 这些可以备份和同步的 APP 则没有这个担忧。\n\n \n\n重要的网络账号单单只靠密码来保证安全是不够稳妥的，因为它们很容易泄露。「两步验证」才是目前互联网上最佳的安全举措，你不应该忽略它。对于重要的账号，基本上只要开启了两步验证并且保存好备用恢复码，它们就几乎不可能被陌生人盗用，轻松把帐号被盗的损失风险和概率降到了最低。\n\n另外，使用服务器的话，一定要做好安全防火墙措施，因为处于公网环境，不做好安全措施，你的服务器就成全球黑客的肉鸡了。安全生产要求我们做到不断提高安全生产意识，把安全生产工具用好。除了使用安全工具外，操作上，也要定期更改密码，换用钱包地址，每次操作谨慎授权。助记词、私钥不触网。不懂多问，问对人。\n\n当然，现实并不存在百分之一百安全的措施或防线。任何系统都受时间空间条件限制，因此都有漏洞。最大的漏洞是人，人制定的规则那一定会有漏洞。在此，推荐大家看一下《我是谁，没有绝对安全的系统》这部电影。我相信这对大家提高安全意识很有帮助。\n\n毫无疑问，市场上有大鳄镰刀，生活中有衙门快刀。我们在生产上力求资产安全的同时，切勿忽略人身安全。币圈诱惑太多，但绝非法外之地。请勿以身试法，尤其是熟练运用上文高效生产部分的工具后。千万别搞出“包是上午抓的，人是下午进去的”的笑话和悲剧。\n\n安全生产，做到有所为，有所不为，谨慎方能捕得千秋蝉。\n\n \n\n**稳定生产**\n\n稳定生产意指生产效益或者产出稳定。效益或者产出取决于对时机和卡位的把握程度。好时机不常有，而羊毛党到处都是。内卷程度越来越严重，吃肉门槛越来越高。十年不发市，发市吃十年并不是不好，但不确定因素太多，弄不好或许还会陷入个有上顿没下顿的困境局面。\n\n毫无疑问，稳定生产离不开周全缜密的“攻”与“守”战线的系统性布局。撸为攻，布为守，攻守双管齐下以求稳。\n\n攻，讲究时效性，抓住机会，蜂群作战，自动化操作。伺机而动、精准狙击，利用工具集群控制、批量操作。该战术极有可能会将空投门槛提高，令到有些底端的真实用户都沦为炮灰。蚊子肉都可干成大肥肉；\n\n守，讲究把握好位置，节点，卡位。赛道龙头是不错的布局点。一夫当关万夫莫开是也。通俗点的形容，“守”战线的布局与打麻将听牌一样,空投砸中就和牌。我总结为四个级别：低级（听死牌）、初级（单钓听）、中级（听三张）、高级（听八张）：\n\n \n\n低级（听死牌）：花费了gas交互或者捐款给不会发币的项目。项目没有收入来源，项目方也没钱。这种根本没有空投预期的可能。不过这种为Web3发展贡献大爱的精神也是值得嘉奖的。\n\n \n\n初级（单钓听）：布局某个没发币的平台，比如某某不知名的Dex，还没发币，去做一下交互，以期未来协议发布代币得到空投。\n\n \n\n中级（听三张）：Opensea平台属于这个等级的典型例子。Opensea是世界上第一个也是最大的NFT交易平台，无疑是该赛道的龙头。目前Opensea还没发布平台代币。另外，同一赛道的其他项目为了引流用户，通常将空投瞄准赛道龙头的用户。又如，持有某个赛道龙头的代币，链上投票行为，这些都是空投敏感神经。\n\n \n\n高级（听八张）：例如Gticoin、clr.fund组织的每一轮捐款，尤其是当其自身平台都还没发布代币时。组网布局都属于这一布局级别。\n\n \n\n布局空投是为术数，精髓是无中生有，以假乱真，真作假时，假亦真。举个通俗的例子，犹如一班人在深山里同时遇到老虎，你只要不是跑得最慢的一个，你都是安全的。如何解读呢？在布局空投时，你跑得比真是用户还快，那你就不会被拿掉。别老是傻傻地问该交互多少金额多少次了。这个绝对是个动态变量，因内卷程度和项目方格局变动而变动。唯一不变就是变化。正如《天道》中所言：能人所不能，忍人所不忍，这就是你的生存空间。\n\n攻守同盟，动静合一，广撒网，深挖洞，排兵布阵以求稳。\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n**优质生产**\n\n \n\n好品质，资本造。资本是以追逐利益为目的的，其本质是获得利润。金蛋需要耗费大量的人力物力财力和时间成本精心培育。普通人甚至是币圈科学家都没有这些资源耗得起。但这并不影响币圈科学家优质生产。我们可以运用上高楼的朴素理论（一步一步爬楼辛苦，坐电梯一键直达，坐电梯不需要造电梯），借助资本的肩膀，淘到金蛋。资本天生对市场有灵敏的嗅觉，有花香的地方有蜜蜂。就算我们没能力闻到花香，但我们能见到蜂采蜜。这就足够了。资本可以充当币圈科学家淘金蛋的领路人。虽然有了领路人，但路还是需要我们自己走。淘到金蛋还是坏蛋很大程度上会因各自知识架构、认知水平有别。金蛋项目如果不向社区释放奖励或空投，那这项目就算有大资本加持都与币圈科学家无关。因为资本不止一种获利途径退出。比如传统资本市场上市，被收购等等。那有没有法宝很大程度上保障币圈科学家优质生产呢？两大方面分析：定性分析与定量分析。定性分析指标辨别金蛋坏蛋，定量分析指标度量蛋大蛋小。\n\n \n\n一、定性分析\n\n \n\n1、项目治理方式：治理方式是公司形式、基金会形式、DAO的过渡形式还是DAO形式，这反映出项目的发展路线是否去中心化以及去中心化的程度。公司形式受到各国法律条条框框的诸多限制，高度中心化。币圈科学家应对其敬而远之。基金会形式相对好点，会出现一些金蛋项目。DAO的过渡形式和DAO形式会有大量金蛋，其中DAO形式去中心化程度最高。“民有、民治、民享”是DAO的精髓，DAO使币圈科学家垂涎不已。因为币圈科学家的杀手锏是蜂群，蜂群是Web3中的“民”，是军团。\n\n2、项目协议权限：\n\n协议权限直接决定项目是否去中心化以及去中心化程度。智能合约一经部署，便永久存在于链上（只要有节点运行），无人可以篡改，除非合约部署者，也就是智能合约的管理者设置了某些权限或者在智能合约设置有后门。这直接决定项目的去中心化程度。大部分项目常见做法是在项目发展初、中期设置某些权限，然后逐渐放权，向DAO过渡。\n\n3、项目发展理念：理念是项目发展的指南针，愿景是未来蓝图。项目要走什么方向，要到那里去由其理念所驱动。笼子困不住向往自由的小鸟。\n\n \n\n二、定量分析\n\n \n\n1、项目融资背景：项目是否融资、融资金额以及投资方直接决定项目估值。融资是项目加速发展的助推器。同一赛道，同一类型项目多如牛毛。项目的发展也要直面上高楼。在内卷状态下，同等的市场机会，融资就是花钱买时间，买资源，增加防被卷的筹码，然后快速聚集赛道资源，壮大自我。没有助推器，难成大龙头。知名投资机构有a16z、binance labs、1kx、三箭、coinbase ventures、NGC、paradigm等等。金蛋大小往往由这个指标决定。\n\n2、项目业务模式：项目的业务模式决定其盈利水平，盈利水平决定资本是否入局，花香招蜂。面对会下金蛋的母鸡，资本的本性原形毕露。有持续利润支撑的业务模式，会确保金蛋经得起时间的考验。\n\n3、项目赛道地位：“二八”法则和马太效应会成就强者恒强。大龙头大格局，大树底下好乘凉。\n\n4、项目团队背景：团队能力、效率、品行和格局，是决定金蛋大小的关键因素。好工匠造好器。\n\n5、项目合作伙伴：合作是资源共享，取长补短，相互成就。通过吸引力法则，正能量吸引正能量。合作伙伴越多、越靠谱，该项目的发展前景也不会差。\n\n6、项目发展生态：生态越早期，发展诉求越强烈，释放红利越多。把钱散开，将心聚拢。以红利换发展，先让部分人富起来，营造财富效应，资源来了，发展就起来了。生态越繁荣，其稳定性越强，越有能力对抗风险。\n\n7、项目社群规模：“得民心者得天下”，社群是项目发展之本。项目的枝繁叶茂离不开社群的支持。得不到社群支持的项目犹如无本之木，只会日渐枯萎。当项目需要进一步扩大社群规模的时候，那就需要刺激一下币圈敏感的神经－空投。\n\n \n\n三、风险：优质生产最大的障碍是被反撸。筛选依据主要是技术甄别与追溯快照时间点。其次是合约漏洞、合约后门。\n\n \n\n四、策略：临时策略和短期策略在前文可以找到。长期策略，适合长线布局和大资金布局应对。成为项目早期用户是淘金蛋的绝佳途径，因为早期用户对项目发展贡献度高。这种长线布局的回报期相对比较长。但可以确定，回报会是丰厚的。如果持有大资金该如何布局呢？比如，你是ETH的长线投资者，你是坚持一维单纯坚定持有ETH，还是作多维布局呢？借贷、流动性挖矿、无损、合约、衍生品、期权、期货还是NFT? 大资金布局更适合持有独一无二IP类项目的NFT。比如，Cryptopunks出品方幼虫实验室(Larva Labs)后面出品的Meebits，市场热度很高的无聊猿等等是不错的介入标的（我介入时地板价最低0.7ETH，应自行研究分析，不宜盲目跟进）。首先，这类NFT是以太坊主网上的独一无二资产，以ETH计价。这有三个方面考量：1、独特IP，辨识度高，自带流量，持有会有其他潜在空投预期；2、在市场低迷时，将长线主流代币转换成NFT资产，计价代币升值，NFT的计价也同等升值；3、NFT自身炒作溢价。IP类项目自带天然护城河，是大资金策略配置必选项。（策略受强烈的时间、空间条件限制，因当下市场状况随时调整，我所提策略仅是本人部分见解，仅供学习之用，不作投资建议，风险自担）。\n\n    优质生产可修百步穿杨之功，起一箭三雕之效。\n\n \n\n**促进生产**\n\n知识要学，钱财要赚，身心要平衡。这样高效生产才持久，生产在这种协调下得以促进并进入良性循环。但若处非常之境，还得用非常之法。促产乏力，强力催产。\n\n对于知识，知识改变命运。在币圈，不单时间是金钱，知识也是金钱。用知识武装大脑，是回报率非常高的投资。首先，我们必须掌握一种知识获取能力，帮助我们从爆炸性的知识中提取出对我们有用的知识。只有这样，我们的学习才是最高效的，时间才能被最大化利用。我们快速获取知识有三大原则。\n\n1、简化原则。简化就是跳过对自己可能没用的信息，单刀直入，提取出自己需要的知识。本质的东西都极其至简。取其精华去其糟粕。\n\n2、速度原则。顾名思义，就是加快知识获取的速度或节奏。那么，如何提高我们的学习速度呢？短期来看，提高知识搜索能力是关键。从长远来看，那就需要增强我们的逻辑构建能力，在本质上改善知识获取速度。这时代，快鱼吃慢鱼。\n\n3、容量原则。量变引起质变。当我们想获得一项技能甚至要靠它来生存时，只有积累足够的知识量，我们才能更客观、更深入地审视一个行业，从而认清自己所处的位置，以及如何科学规划未来发展。\n\n知识是进步的阶梯，也是财富大厦的砖石。获取知识的途径有很多种。\n\n1、读书。书本是智慧的结晶。读书是我们获取知识最方便快捷的途径之一。在书中，我们不但可以学习别人的智慧，也可以了解别人的一些技术，更能开阔自己的视野和格局。   \n\n2、教是最好的学。当我们在教别人知识的同时，总是害怕自己学的不好，误人子弟，而这正是促进我们学习更多知识的一种推力。当然，教别人也可以巩固我们自身的知识，教也是知识应用的一种方式，有助于加深大脑记忆。\n\n3、跟牛人学习。跟牛人学习知识，是最快最精准获得知识的途径。因为牛人教的知识是其经过千锤百炼提炼出来的精华，当我们跟着牛人学习可以少走很多弯路，同时让我们走得更快更高。\n\n4、网络学习。随着互联网的发展，网络教育发展得越来越快，只要适当的选择靠谱的平台，网络教育也是让我们快速成长的途径之一。\n\n5、社群学习。如果说一个人走的更快那么一群人将会走得更远，在个人的学习中，我们容易半途而废，但在社群中学习，我们会不由自主地被其中的学习气氛所感染，我们的学习之路将会走得更远，当然我们也有可能结识更多的牛人。古训云：三人行，必有我师。\n\n6、劳动总结。时间是检验真理的唯一标准，劳动创造价值，丰富的经验和方法技术。知识架构总结归类推导。\n\n在知识决定财富的时代，我们需要快速高效地获取我们所需的知识，从而构建自己的知识体系，以应对瞬息万变的行业及市场。行业在发展，市场在扩大。更新旧知识，习得新技能。淘汰落后产能，拥抱科学技术。学海无涯，不辍前行；通证不眠，机会不止。\n\n对于金钱，钱不是万能，没钱寸步难行。金钱是生产系统的产物，是一种结果的体现，也是检验风险管理体系是否健康的重要指标。同时，金钱也服务于生产系统以扩大生产、促进生产。生产的意义应以人为中心，人为本，财为末，不可本末倒置。\n\n对于身心，身要生活，心有所往。\n\n生活不止眼前的苟且，还有\\*\\*和远方的苟且。凡胎肉体，皆有喜怒哀乐。尤其在撸的前线，烦躁与焦虑常伴左右，一个链上堵塞或是一个未知关卡就能将人逼到精神崩溃，目光呆滞。这些负能量的长期累积对生产没有任何好处。熵的增加只会拖累生产系统，降低生产率。这些负能量应当及时找个适当的方式或出口释放出来。方式有很多种，比如去\\*\\*按个摩、洗个脚，或者去远方苟且一下也未尝不可。正如圈内流行的段子：你不梭，我不梭，\\*\\*嫩模谁爱摸（调侃归调侃，二级市场不是币圈科学家的猎场，风险大，信息不对称，科学家也被割成韭菜头）。\n\n心有所往，力有所聚。人生营营役役，熙熙攘攘。每个人的脚步都在各自思想与认知构建的笼子里徘徊。有人一路向前，如鱼得水；有人碌碌无为，不可终日。区别是人们努力与否吗？不，每个人每天的时间都只有24小时，每天不止脚步。但为什么会有截然不同的人生局面呢？皆因人们是否知其所从以及是否得其路。人生能清楚自己要做什么、为了什么的能有几人？生活中有太多的选择，今天挑西瓜，明天捡芝麻，样样都想要。眼向各处瞟，劲往四周使。于是就容易陷入人生的迷宫里，兜兜转转。当人生走错了方向的时候，越努力，状况越差。这时候停下脚步才是正确的抉择，停下来找准方向再出发。别看有的人一路向前，如鱼得水，可能他们不全都知道自己为什么从其向、择其路，但他们的领路人知道。这位领路人或是父辈，或是领导，抑或是师父。这是他们人生的指南针。漫漫人生路，没有领路人，就犹如在一望无际的大海中漂泊的没有指南针的小帆船，随波逐流。路途要导航，人生要导师。人生如此，币圈亦然。教练不一定是世界冠军，但所有世界冠军都有教练。你在一维认知孤身奋战的时候，有人却在多维联动下实现了精准爆破。\n\n人生当有使命感，为使命而干不会迷茫，不迷茫的人生才有强劲动力投入生产。但人生变化无常，难免身陷非常之境。世间万物相生相克，相互依存，循序前进。身陷困境是因为某些事件因素出了差错才导致的结果。当身处绝境，该如何实现脱胎换骨，摆脱困境呢？\n\n第一步：去神除鬼。心里不含任何鬼神的信仰。去神的方法就是强者理论。无论是佛祖还是神仙或者是上帝，这些神明如果具象化的存在，那么就会有实力高低之分。如果你信仰了某个神明，那么这个神明遇到另外一个比他更强的神明，并且被那个神明所消灭，那么你的神明就不复存在了，或者出现更强的存在把所有的人类神明都消灭了。所以人类的神明在强者理论面前不堪一击。至于除鬼，如果存在鬼，那么鬼是低级的能量体。对应存在的神可以轻轻松松地消灭鬼魂，神与鬼是猫和老鼠的关系。如果存在鬼把你杀了，那么你变成鬼后，你可以疯狂地对其报复。所以鬼应该是最底层的。\n\n第二步：认清自我。思维扩散到宇宙，我只是地球上面的一个生物而已。无论生死都对整个宇宙无法激起丝毫涟漪。同样地，无论富豪还是权贵，大家都只是宇宙里的一颗尘埃，都是同一种生命能量体。所以并不存在生命层次划分，也不存在永恒的阶级。王侯将相宁有种乎？所以无论你面对多么强大的对手，对方在生命层次上和你是处于同一水平，都有七情六欲，会生老病死。那么你就没必要先入为主地认为自己低人一等。\n\n第三步：重塑自我。核心就是魂身分离。单独把灵魂和躯壳分开。把自己的思维全部融入灵魂。可以理解为把身体当作一个机器或者工具，而灵魂负责控制这个躯壳的所有操作。这样做不仅可以让你获得超强的自制力，还可以让自己随时处于清醒状态。\n\n第四步：时空错乱。做法是将当下与未来隔离。当你现在面对一个极大的困难时，你就把你的灵魂从躯壳里面超脱出来，将时间拉到未来那个你已经克服了这个困难的点，那时你已经通过周全的方案经过时间的流逝把这件事妥善地解决了。然后再将时光倒退回来，将未来的那个处理方案放在当下按部就班执行，剩下的交给时间，从而完成自我救赎。\n\n富在术数不在劳身，利在势局不在力耕。你所依靠的，能助你腾飞，亦能碍你前行。就像火箭腾飞过程中不舍弃燃料仓就无法到达预定轨道。同样地，若要实现生产的突破与腾飞，就要吐故纳新，超然物外，万念归一，术业专攻，顺势而为。\n\n \n\n**后语**\n\n \n\n科学技术是第一生产力，生产是技术过程，发展经济是目的。愿本文打开你思维的一扇窗，对在币圈的你有实质性的帮助，帮你打造自己的财富铲子。愿你阅后豁然开朗，武装大脑，用思维武器为你创造财富。这也是《币圈科学家生产指南》的意义所在。\n\n道可，道非，常道。道术相依，万物可破。币圈科学家成于币圈，不止币圈！\n\n \n\n全文完！缺乏灵感，仓促作文，词不达意，将就将就，望你海涵。后期会编写有实操教程和案例的《币圈科学家生产指南》一书，敬请期待！（丑话先说：本文一出，必受千夫所指。弱者喜欢道德标榜，习惯拿来主义，无视天道，鄙视竞争，输打赢要。我本无意得罪，如果弱者的泪和呐喊可以左右天道之轮，那喷也无妨，俯首甘为孺子牛。）\n\n \n\n我会在知识星球（搜：金

{"id": "1fkkaVpOzcmF-AAA8Rk6QHRrQq7U5s9gV50pZGQmhzU", "title": "区块链到底有多重要？（1）", "body": "区块链到底有多重要？是未来互联网世界里的基石。\n\n当下，在互联网移动互联网的江湖里，邮箱、手机号等是我们人类进入互联网的令牌。\n\n今后，钱包是我们人类进入以区块链技术为基石的互联网的令牌。\n\n以下，分几个方面说明技术的重要性以及一些应用实例。\n\n一、去中心化的重要性\n\nfacebook宕机是最近发生的事情，bitcoin网络自建立以来没有发生过宕机事件，甚至在2021年5月19日ban of China也没有发生宕机。这就是去中心化的硬度，它不取决于中心化组织（企业、政府）的决策，仅仅取决于共识。只要有共识这张网就会持续运行下去，而共识的摧毁，尤其是世界性共识的摧毁又是异常的难。\n\n而建立在去中心化核心思想的区块链网络，才是真正的具有记忆的网络，全节点的重要作用就是不依托于任何一个中心节点。《疑犯追踪》这个美剧其中有一个情节，将网络分布式存储在电网系统的智能设备中，看上去很玄幻，其实并不玄幻，现下bitcoin网络就存在于世界上各个角落里的个人计算机、硬盘中，只要联网就有全备份。虽然看似很不经济，但却坚强无比。\n\n试想一下，如果有一天本应数据一致的库因为某种原因导致5/5分的不同数据，简单以中美举例，中国向美国出口1000只手套，价格是0.8刀/只，美国向中国付款800刀。但是因为特殊原因两边的联络断了，美国人把价格改为0.6刀/只，当联络恢复后应该相信哪一方？\n\n区块链网络就不会，因为要广播，要51%确认记录账本，且保证每一个账本都是一致的，即便联络中断，也能保证历史数据的唯一性。\n\n二、链上账本的重要性\n\n三、钱包匿名的重要性\n\n经常被骚扰短信困扰吧？先生，买房吗？先生，贷款吗？真真的是不胜其扰。在每一个手机号背后的人，经过互联网的客户画像已经把我们用户的信息传遍了世界，为什么打开TB就能看到我们想要买的东西，而且非常匹配我们的喜好。因为我们在互联网世界留下了痕迹。\n\n在深入的体验了区块链世界里的钱包以后，metamask、onekey、imtoken等等之后，我从震惊到醒悟，原来在网络世界里可以这么玩耍，不要接收到无用的信息，所有的交互需要用户的授权，当然目前绝大部分是建立在数字货币基础上的。只要在区块链的世界里拥有一个钱包，钱包里拥有能够证明自己价值的资产，就可以在这个世界里享受喜爱的事物。比如Pornhub，比如NFT。不再需要手机关联的银行卡，不再需要家庭住址、工作单位的关联。这兴许才是元宇宙。区块链的世界正在用钱包、用钱包里的数字资产或者数字艺术品或者游戏角色来建设一个与现实世界映射的数字世界，甚至远大于这个现实世界。\n\n试想一下，如果王者荣耀不再是用微信或者QQ登录，用钱包登录，打怪升级的结果都是个性化的NFT，所有的花费和对战经历都具有价值，那游戏的世界是不是会更不同。现在游戏区块链宇宙已经开始，而且正以无法阻挡的趋势高速发展，Rarity、Gamefi是开拓者。\n\n四、价值互联的重要性\n\n正如前文所述，拥有了钱包之后，再区块链网络世界里就具备了价值互联的基础，比如我写的这篇文章是再区块链网络中撰写及发表的，当然是通过我的钱包链接的，那么我把他做成一个NFT，那这篇文章就被我确权了。引用其中的内容如果我认为需要收费，就可以建立支付通道让引用的人直接转账到我的钱包。这就是创作价值。\n\n试想一下，天下文章一大抄这个千古规律是否可以转变为，抄可以，要么注明归属，要么付费转移产权。这是按劳分配的社会主义啊！\n\n五、数据产权的重要性\n\n六、个体隐私的重要性\n\n声明：1.这不是一篇科普贴\n\n2\\.这不是一篇口水贴\n\n3\\.这就是一篇自己思考的总结", "timestamp": 1633784708, "digest": "0U49OoPgZkPEcM_IRXltuDR2Ydz1CifLvq_SWt472Wc", "contributor": "0xBA38EEA0cd18a0Ba7eE1F5d9861FC7DaF2895929"}

Tenemos pensado lanzar un esfuerzo más rumbo a ese desarrollo al final de la temporada. Pongan atención para más detalles. \n \n* **LOOT20 Project Reveal**\n\n  Un proyecto alternativo resultado de una inversión en los originales LOOT NFTs, una oportunidad se presentó de trabajar en un proyecto que incorpora LOOT y sus derivativos en un envolvente para crear y jugar campañas estilo Dungeons and Dragons.\n\n## Season Pass\n\n**La Temporada de la Abundancia** inicia nuestro primer camino para actividades comunitarias a través de la narración de historias. Esperamos que ayude a los miembros de la comunidad a ganar recompensas y contribuir a HVND participando en eventos, completando desafíos, siendo activos en las redes sociales, participando en defi y NFT. Las temporadas también ofrecen recompensas exclusivas adicionales para que los miembros de la comunidad ganen con acceso premium y NFT de historias.\n\n**¿Cómo funciona?**\n\n* Cada semana se les da un conjunto de tareas a los miembros para que las completen y avancen al siguiente nivel dentro del pase de temporada. \n* Al final de cada semana, se recopila una instantánea para capturar la finalización de la tarea para que los jugadores canjeen sus recompensas. \n* Para los jugadores que completen todas las recompensas, se puede completar un conjunto especial de tareas para obtener contenido adicional de la historia y más.\n\n### Season Pass NFT\n\n**El NFT de la Temporada de la Abundancia** estará disponible por 0.2ETH el 10 de octubre de 2021. Se tomará registro de todos los poseedores con tokens de 100 $ HVND, HVND de ACCESS y HVND de AFFLUENCE NFTS el 8 de octubre a las 9 p.m. EST .

Dependiendo del éxito de esta temporada y del ancho de banda que se nos brinde, es posible que revisemos esto hacia el final del año.\n\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n1. **¿Cómo funciona este NFT con los NFT de Access y Crowdfund existentes?**\n\n   Para nuestros miembros que poseen el crowdfund y acceden a nfts, estos juegan un papel en el establecimiento de la tradición de esta temporada y pueden usarse de una manera especial para completar los eventos de la temporada. Específicamente para el HVND de ACCESS NFT, estos se hicieron para dirigirse a personas que no participaron en el crowdfund y / o no pudieron recibir un crowdfund NFT (debido a un error en el contrato), por lo que estos NFT especiales tienen propiedades que modifican algunas de las recompensas encontradas. dentro del pase de temporada. ¡Se revelará más información relacionada con estos NFT a medida que complete su pase!\n2. **¿Cómo participar en la categoria de recompensas premium?**\n\n   Al comprar el SEASON PASS NFT. El SEASON PASS NFT se limitará a 1 compra por persona con miembros de $ HVND y titulares de NFT ya agregados a la cola.\n\n\n---\n\n*BLVKHVND (Black Hand) es una comunidad de juegos de dSports centrada en el juego competitivo, la creación de contenido y la accesibilidad para ayudar a los jugadores, colaborar con los desarrolladores, amplificar la creatividad y descentralizar la industria en su conjunto.

Memes to go\n\n\n---\n\n### What is CityDAO?\n\nThe CityDAO community is made up of ambitious and HIGHLY curious people exploring and building at the frontier of technology, governance and physical land.\n\nThe vision of CityDAO is to build the city of the future on the Ethereum blockchain by tokenizing land, rights, and governance.\n\n## 🔈CityDAO so far\n\nFirst, let’s do a quick recap of the CityDAO adventure so far:\n\n**Month 1: July - laying the groundwork**\n\n* **July 1** - DAOs can legally be recognized as an LLC in Wyoming\n* **July 2** - CityDAO starts (Scott’s infamous tweet)\n* **July 7** - First community call\n* **July 15** - CityDAO Discord membership crosses 1000 people\n* **July 23** - CityDAO officially registered as an LLC in Wyoming\n* **July 28** - CityDAO gets voted in on Mirror’s $WRITE RACE\n\n**Month 2: August - bolstering the treasury**\n\n* **August 8** - The First Citizen NFT sells for 6.52 ETH\n* **August 11** - Release Founding Citizen NFTs\n* **August 12** - CityDAO treasury passes $30k\n* **August 20** - CityDAO treasury passes $100k\n* **August 25** - Founding Citizen NFT sells for 10 ETH live in a community call\n* **August 25** - CityDAO treasury passes $250k\n* **August 26** - Connect w/ real estate agent in Wyoming to help with land purchase\n\n**Month 3: September - voting on land acquisition**\n\n* **September 08** - CityDAO forum is added to aid governance discussions\n* **September 15** - Dev & Design team demo the parcel viewer\n* **September 21** - CityDAO citizens vote on first parcel purchase\n* **September 27** - Citizens vote to make offer on “Parcel 6” (40 acres)\n* **September 28** - CityDAO makes an offer on real land\n* **September 28** - Offer accepted, land purchase process begins\n\n### Live footage of CityDAO going from tweet to citizens voting on putting an offer on 40 acres of real Wyoming land…in 3 months 😂 :\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vKOY51NA2DwmZbQoll1rV.gif?height=400&width=480)\n\n\n---\n\n# 🔈News & Updates\n\n# 🗞 Annnnd our DAO has officially purchased land! 🎊\n\n![WAGMI vibes right here](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FmbW8L0eDN3hh_cUBjUlE.png?height=702&width=1043)\n\n![CityDAO flag going up on the land](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/H-C4tGhmdYUCcJalTF-H5.png?height=1398&width=1054)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k2kW3fYZebFAqQJTUNbuz.png?height=197&width=375)\n\n### 🗞 OpenSea de-listed CityDAO\n\n[https://twitter.com/chadfowler/status/1444365420388044806?s=20](https://twitter.com/chadfowler/status/1444365420388044806?s=20)\n\n**What happened?**\n\nWe found out the NFTs were de-listed from new members asking why they couldn’t buy a Citizen NFT. We received no notification, e-mail or information at all from OpenSea as to what happened. We sent multiple support tickets, reached out in their Discord server, and finally got some answers after utilizing our collective networks to get a hold of someone there.\n\n**Why did they de-list the NFTs?**\n\nSince land tokenization is central to our DAO and these NFTs would give access to land drops they believe the NFTs went against their terms. They explained its because OpenSea doesn't allow listing real estate. Our NFTs are not real estate but they don’t want to support anything that could be related.\n\n[OpenSea experienced controversy](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58585342) in September with an insider trading situation. They are likely highly risk-averse right now.\n\n### 🗞 What’s next? Solution: create independent smart contract (in development)\n\n1. The new one will be ERC721 and 100% independent of any exchange. Minting will be done through our site.\n2. Once ready, previous NFTs can be exchanged 1:1 with the new ones at any time, and they have the same rights/value.\n\n### 🗞 When will Citizen NFTs be available again?\n\nTimeline TBD but we anticipate it being in the near-future. Please reach out if you have any questions or have experience in this space. We’ll post in #announcements once we have updates.\n\n### 🗞 Parcel Viewer - here’s a glimpse of the CityDAO parcel explorer! @Greg, @Bpetes, @odyslam and @scott have been on fire with this one 🔥\n\n> A web app to view & trade CityDAO land parcels\n\n[Here’s a link to a 45 second Loom for a better view](https://www.loom.com/share/a9adac738b2d4003a12ad3359e26f846).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/snbdoc4j5qWBAm4A4Kf5O.gif?height=270&width=480)\n\n### 🗞 So… Balaji’s call-to-action sounds fun.

I've not been checking in and here you got your land already!\n\nI am experienced in Computer Vision and have recently been using Drones for mapping and training CV models to detect objects from the air.\n\nI cannot wait for property and realspace assets are on the blockchain.\n\nhave heard quite a lot of people discussing citydao lately and wanted to hop in and say hello\n\njust to discuss, casually, perhaps over dinner and not during official hours, about possibly changes in the land registration process\n\nHey all, I haven't been around for a couple months, but I wanted to say I'm blown away with all the progress that's been made!\n\nI've been doing some research into water rights in Wyoming. Here's a summary of the laws in a government memo, but it's from 2001 (and it looks like the source document could be even older)\n\nThis is one of the most interesting projects I've ever seen in crypto, not just in NFT. I'm waiting for the bar results right now, but if all goes well i'll be a cryptolawyer soon!\n\nbuying one parcel as a DAO is our first step, and allowing members to own a piece of that parcel. the city aspect comes as more people start building on the land and we deal with questions like what is allowed to be built and funding public goods.\n\nThe land is in Wyoming. It's very rural - 40 minutes north west of Cody, Wyoming\n\nout of curiosity, are they referring to this CityDAO or maybe they're just referring to CityDAOs in a general sense?\n\nCommunity Call happening now - we will go over the land parcels and DAO citizens will share the reasons they like or dislike each parcel. Will be a fun time, see ya soon!\n\nFormer commercial real estate finance underwriting pro (mostly CMBS type stuff, some CDOs) based in Brooklyn.\n\nuseless observation -- \"Kirschbaum\" (current owner?) means \"Cherry Tree\"\n\nI'd also say there's another layer of deeper questions being asked here beyond just streamlining ownership and revenue generation\n\nHey all, love what you’re doing. Awesome to see the beginnings of on chain land ownership.\n\nI am a commercial property developer from South Africa.\n\nInteresting documents on Well water quality and Disclosures from the broker today on Parcel 6\n\nExcited to give what I can to this community and hopefully build the future of cities with you all!\n\nI'm a software engineer, working on building 5G networks. Outside of that, I host The Urban Loop podcast where I talk to technologists and city leaders about building the Smart Cities of the future\n\nLast chance to vote on the land parcel!\n\nthey gave us no explanation, but it was shortly after i requested verification for the collection. i think its because our project is tokenizing real assets\n\nWhat's good citiziens of citydao, my friend just turned me on to this. Just came back from Wyoming on a massive 4,500 mile roadtrip\n\n## 🐦 Some recent tweets we love\n\n[https://twitter.com/CroissantEth/status/1443971953187069955?s=20](https://twitter.com/CroissantEth/status/1443971953187069955?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/nichanank/status/1438205060777865218?s=20](https://twitter.com/nichanank/status/1438205060777865218?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/anotherjohnbeck/status/1439325370742833152?s=20](https://twitter.com/anotherjohnbeck/status/1439325370742833152?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/gid3xn/status/1442249426668376066?s=20](https://twitter.com/gid3xn/status/1442249426668376066?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/spaghettiNFT/status/1443493722474221574?s=20](https://twitter.com/spaghettiNFT/status/1443493722474221574?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/BoredElonMusk/status/1446316443247595520?s=20](https://twitter.com/BoredElonMusk/status/1446316443247595520?s=20)\n\n\n---\n\n# ☕️ Resources shared in CityDAO\n\n[https://twitter.com/theindiedao/status/1445410822134501386?s=20](https://twitter.com/theindiedao/status/1445410822134501386?s=20)\n\n## 🎨 Meme to go\n\n**H/T to @Greg for this spicy meme 🌶**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g-6lBZ_pPFp_J5akUZtiw.png?height=992&width=898)\n\n**H/T to @Justin Kalland**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1mBD6wn2XjIHzlLImsu2X.png?height=500&width=750)\n\n### Past CityDAO Roundups\n\n[https://chance.ghost.io/citydao-community-roundup-vol-1-so-it-begins/](https://chance.ghost.io/citydao-community-roundup-vol-1-so-it-begins/)\n\n[https://city.mirror.xyz/jTi0-xQOMadDgvP_KgMOoHZaYvWJY6D7YK4bcdFz-f4](https://city.mirror.xyz/jTi0-xQOMadDgvP_KgMOoHZaYvWJY6D7YK4bcdFz-f4)\n\n[https://city.mirror.xyz/4t6MRC8re_vTuJiVqkKmJTPXBpurzwb1N3v8S6bSJJs](https://city.mirror.xyz/4t6MRC8re_vTuJiVqkKmJTPXBpurzwb1N3v8S6bSJJs)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633785750, "digest": "1HoGdPHJ4NBmLW_sEun299_QiZTl5WHQAZfa9G8J8NY", "contributor": "0x77aA943A365161e499eaFF59E936a799e6051e15"}

和 Burberry 等顶级时尚品牌纷纷涉足 NFT 领域。D\\&G; 于 9 月 27 日完成了具有特色的数字时装系列的销售，总销售额为 565 万美元。\n\n除了名人和大品牌发出的主流信号之外，另一个方面将会在 NFT 领域中变得越来越重要：拥有 NFT 所提供的效用。无论是通过获得额外的 NFT 奖励（Meebits、Punks Comic 等）还是通过产生被动收入，这些 NFT 都在寻找一种方法来奖励数字艺术品的所有者。\n\n例如，CyberKongz 和 SupDucks 等项目通过持有平台的 NFT 为持有者提供被动收入。在 CyberKongz 的中，Kongz NFT 的持有者每天会收到 10 BANANA 作为收益。按照目前的 BANANA 价格，这相当于每天 497 美元。\n\n当 NFT 与游戏领域碰撞时，NFT 的作用会显得更加重要。NFT 是区块链游戏的主要支柱之一。与传统游戏相比，NFT 让链游玩家对他们的游戏物品拥有真正的所有权。在第三季度，游戏内物品产生了 23 亿美元的交易量，而这占了 NFT 总量的 22%！由此可见，游戏正在与 NFT 产生真正的协同作用。\n\n![三季度 DApp 市场回顾：链游蓬勃发展，DeFi 多链化加速](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/7908490cfd4204cef97925f882c8b8f6.jpg-article)\n\n### DeFi 现状\n\n虽然目前加密市场的大部分聚光灯都被 NFT 和游戏所吸引，但 DeFi 竞赛中的全景变得更加有趣。在第三季度结束时，DeFi 领域的总锁仓价值 (TVL) 约为 1781.2 亿美元，其中的 92.37% （1663.8 亿美元）被锁定在 6 个公链中。与上一季度末相比，DeFi 领域的 TVL 增长了 104%，在 9 月 6 日达到了 1950 亿美元的峰值。\n\n![三季度 DApp 市场回顾：链游蓬勃发展，DeFi 多链化加速](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/8f172c7f96c30908082dabb6b2761597.jpg-article)\n\n尽管就 TVL 而言，以太坊仍然是领先的区块链，但 Solana、Terra 和 Avalanche 三个公链取得的进展堪称典范。Solana 与其他几个网络一样，直接受益于以太坊交易成本过高的缺点，Solana 的 TVL 已达到 82.8 亿美元，比上一季度增长了 1,300%。仅考虑 TVL 来说，Solana 是目前第三大 DeFi 公链。\n\n![三季度 DApp 市场回顾：链游蓬勃发展，DeFi 多链化加速](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/7e1daec2a8edc1ed1df44d8e8319c6bb.jpg-article)\n\nTerra 已成为 TVL 方面的第四大 DeFi 公链。它拥有行业内交易量最大的稳定币之一，即 Terra USD (UST)。目前，Terra 的 TVL 为 80.9 亿美元，环比增长 137%。Terra 的 DeFi 生态系统拥有四个 TVL 超过 10 亿美元的 DApp。例如，收益优化器 Anchor 的 TVL 已超过 30 亿美元，而 Terra 的 Lido 则为 25 亿美元。对于 Terra 网络中 DeFi 的潜力，我们可以继续保持乐观。\n\n![三季度 DApp 市场回顾：链游蓬勃发展，DeFi 多链化加速](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/7c5d2c7be708cf2c3aae11ab0bffadb8.jpg-article)\n\n币安智能链（BSC）是第二大 DeFi 公链。BSC 拥有 177.8 亿美元的 TVL，比上一季度增长 9.98%。尽管 BSC 用户将注意力转向 GameFi 类型的 DApp，但该公链的 TVL 仍在上升。\n\n![三季度 DApp 市场回顾：链游蓬勃发展，DeFi 多链化加速](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/dd20be8c6d2af94286ea128752fb7b07.jpg-article)\n\nBSC 最重要的 DeFi 之一是 PancakeSwap，它是 BSC 用户最常用的 DApp。PancakeSwap 的 TVL 在第三季度末为 87.1 亿美元，比上一季度增长了 39.83%。该应用在过去 30 天内有 306 万个活跃钱包地址，环比增长了 21%。PancakeSwap 的前景是光明的，因为该 DApp 正在推出自己的 NFT 集合，可以在同一平台内进行交易。毫无疑问，PancakeSwap 是 BSC 的「皇冠上的明珠」。\n\nPolygon 的 DeFi 前景似乎不像三个月前那么乐观，目前，Polygon 的 TVL 为 30.2 亿美元，在本季度被 Terra、Solana 和 Avalanche 超越。\n\n![三季度 DApp 市场回顾：链游蓬勃发展，DeFi 多链化加速](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/5937cc0c268dc87cd7198b6e9e030c3e.jpg-article)\n\n### 总结\n\n在观察了加密市场第三季度的发展情况后，有很多值得兴奋的理由。正如 DappRadar 首席执行官 Skirmantas Januskas 所指出的那样，「区块链行业在上个季度取得了相当多的成果——25% 的活跃钱包地址增长绝非易事。但真正让人尖叫的是‘ DApps 获得了游戏’的发展、态度的变化以及在这短短三个月中出现的新趋势。」\n\n「多样化意味着更多的用例，更多的用例意味着更多的采用。该行业正在扩展。加密不仅仅是投资组合中的一篮子资产，它还开始渗透到日常生活中。」\n\n免责声明：作为区块链信息平台，本站所发布文章仅代表作者个人观点，与链闻 ChainNews 立场无关。文章内的信息、意见等均仅供参考，并非作为或被视为实际投资建议。\n", "timestamp": 1633786915, "digest": "bHjMsb0fr5U188ZsgC6Pdizvb-hs8Ae1xsEdWlZDS_Q", "contributor": "0x56B71822d810D7F43466890AF32c26c136439B5f"}

"以下是我2020年写过的、普及DEFI比较全面一篇文章：（附网址链接）\n\n回过头，重新看看，币圈真是时新日益！所以，再看看这些项目，当初的理想都实现了吗？\n\n[https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/6Paone9yvsGNzZ6OEfqzEQ](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/6Paone9yvsGNzZ6OEfqzEQ)\n\n2020年伊始，世界经济迎来前所未有的重创与动荡。然百年大萧条中，往往深藏着百年大机会！ETH2.0，Polkadot，波卡，Filecoin，DEX，DeFi与减半延续，CSW结案..... 这一个个可期的催化剂，无疑让区块链领域价值在这混乱之世闪闪发光。\n\n这其中，DeFi异军突起，并迅速成为整个区块链行业最具有吸引力的板块！资本青睐，平台涌进，似乎所有项目都在拼命蹭它的热点！\n\n有人说它是“新金融革命运动”，有人说它是“区块链下一轮牛市发动机”，也有人说它是“乐高玩具”。那么，DeFi到底是何方神圣？哪里可以搜索到？能否催生超级大牛市？普通人又怎么参与？ \n \n\n***01解析***\n\n***99%的人看不懂DeFi***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Qytcvs0hVP47qShKz-zl4.png?height=194&width=532)\n\nDeFi的全称是Decentralized Finance，即“去中心化金融”，也被称为“开放式金融”。这是一个很大的概念，怎么理解呢？\n\n简单说，就是试图利用区块链技术实现去中介化，消除寻租中间人，从而从各方面改善当前的金融体系，解决传统/中心化金融存在的天然短板。比如解决金融体制不平等、审查流程繁琐、缺乏透明性和潜在的交易风险（不履行合同义务的风险即坏账）等等。\n\n在传统的金融系统中，金融服务主要由中央系统控制和调节，无论是最基本的存取转账、还是贷款或衍生品交易。举个简单的例子，如应用最多的支付和转账板块，在传统金融体系下，要进行跨境支付和转账一般要先告知金融机构，再由金融机构联系国外金融机构进行转账和清算。\n\n![（DeFi对比传统行业与金融科技）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Zv2_kvxkb9bhKfTDHAmiv.png?height=754&width=656)\n\n但是在基于区块链去中心化的金融世界里，可以通过加密货币直接把相应的价值转给对方，并不需要任何中介机构提供服务。这样，不仅大大提高了转账的速度，而且节约了成本。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZWN_da85-AHYrvytaDQyP.png?height=557&width=659)\n\n从普通大众投资角度，DeFi可以简单理解为，就一个兴起的新概念，就如同炒股时，有个新概念出来新板块，上面必然有很多新概念股。如2018年突然大火的dapp概念，只不过那时大多在各类公链上，如今的 DeFi主要都是在ETH上。\n\n 一个很有意思的事是，当前很多人投资用的BTC、ETH，都是去中心化的资产，但是交易却还要在一个中心化的平台上交易，这就是一个很大的矛盾。而在DeFi这个生态系统里，就可以直接实现去中心化交易所交易。\n\n**换言之，在 DeFi 系统中，用户在获取金融服务时，对个人资产和数据有独立控制权；它是在没有中心化实体——储蓄、贷款、交易、保险等等情况下，重建传统的银行服务。即DeFi诞生的核心是建立一个全新的、没有任何中央权力机构主导的金融生态系统，供世界上的每个人随时随地、无准入门槛地使用。**\n\n***02历程***\n\n***DeFi的发展演化史***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hN-EKmPPwWhmQmUndBYfJ.png?height=257&width=632)\n\n2008年金融危机过后，一批金融科技初创企业争相涌出；此后10年，这些金融科技一代，又打造出了一批金融产品与服务。这些金融产品虽然有明显地改进传统银行解决方案，但它们代表的只是渐进式的改进，而不是金融革命。于是，新一批“后浪们”便开始在区块链上探寻“传统”金融科技未实现的金融服务革命，DeFi随之而来！\n\n**2017年，“DeFi概念兴起之年”**  \n\n此时人们需要一种更加便捷和可靠的方式来满足更加多样的金融服务，特别是手中有各种加密资产的人们，希望利用这些资产实现更多的金融功能，创造更大的利益。于是，探索去中心化交易所、去中心化世界的稳定币，开始成为新的关注。\n\n**2018年，“Defi生态架构之年”**\n\n随着更多传统著名的风投基金，如Andreessen Horowitz 等的进场，受风投圈的追捧，那些专注于消除金融服务中中介的项目，便有了新的统称和归属体系，DeFi。此后，DeFi创新者试图将传统金融产品移至区块链，便形成以资产管理、预测市场、交易市场为主的 Defi 生态。但此时，将货币的发行和存储分散化，只是提供了点对点结算的解决方案，还不足以支撑丰富的金融业务。于是，去中心化借贷协议，将 DeFi 带入进一步开放区块链世界的金融系统中。\n\n**2019年，“DeFi金融贷款之年”** \n\n随着市场热点发生剧烈的转变，DeFi在商品服务的分类上也更加多元化，其中以 Synthetix、 Uniswap 及 Set Protocol 分别在衍生品交易市场、去中心化交易所及资产交易上受到瞩目。2019下半年，合成资产兴起，合约及大宗商品、股票、指数等其它金融衍生品逐渐入驻去中心化交易所。\n\n**2020年，“DeFi试验创新之年”** \n\n上半年，资本和技术的快马加鞭，DeFi以惊人的速度生态大爆发，原有的项目被新一波实验和创新所取代，各类新型应用层出不穷，诞生出众多无法想象的产品。DeFi领域火爆代币总市值突破62亿美金，DeFi历经演变、试验和整合，已经出现了一些特定的趋势，成为区块链市场中最耀眼的明星，但仍在建立最有吸引力用例的途中。 \n\n![（DEFI 体系全貌）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4OrrG1CmdKSfHgEoukKyh.png?height=1883&width=1080)\n\n***03独特***\n\n***DeFi的特性与变革*** \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ihWZJz2pI1UkKPfEnfsA3.png?height=269&width=639)\n\n去中心化金融的目的，是利用区块链的关键特性和功能提供无准入门槛的金融服务,从而创建一个更加自由、开放和透明的金融体系，这就包含了去中心化金融市场、去中心化金融机构、资产持有者和使用者。\n\n**因此，DeFi的基础组件包括稳定币、智能合约、金融协议、去中心化应用程序（DAPP）等，这些组件又是底层开放金融的底层基础设施。**有了这些基础设施铺设，加上各个协议之间通过可组合性、安全性、隐私性、透明性，建立起了极强的协议网络互联，比如COMP的挖矿，导致稳定币互换、借贷套利、DEX等的流动性和量都创了历史新高，这就为整个区块链发展提供了新方向。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Mf3km1TPuj0lVIx3oF77y.png?height=467&width=1080)\n\n**DeFi的核心优势和特性，并不在于去中心化本身，在于无需许可、抗审查和可组合性。**\n\n**具体来说，DeFi 系统中:**\n\n1）任何人有访问权限，没有中央控制权； \n 2）无需信任任何中介机构，通过智能合约新的信任在机器和代码上重建； \n 3）所有协议都是开源的，任何人都可以在协议上合作构建新的金融产品，并在网络效应下加速金融创新。 \n\n**DeFi的各类新特性开创出一个开源金融科技平台，带来诸多变革。**\n\n**最重要三大重要变革：**\n\n1）区块链上有原生的资产，从而可以跨主体提高结算效率、重构治理信任。\n\n2）在缺乏中心化的地方,提供了多主体协调的方式。\n\n3）代表了一种新的思维方式和形态，它将给现有行业带来巨大冲击和无限可能。\n\n**总的来说，去中心化金融的目标不是去中心化本身，而是更加自由、开放和公平，是实现普惠金融的最佳途径。**\n\n***04项目***\n\n***DeFi点燃牛市的四把火*** \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Kb_M1d5aWsPS9xt_iciv4.png?height=426&width=1080)\n\n DeFi本质上是映射在区块链上的金融服务，尽管大多数DeFi应用程序运行在以太坊区块链上，但DeFi的先驱无疑是比特币。比特币开启了挑战央行对货币和金融体系垄断的大门，是最初形态的DeFi，此后项目的探索真正引来DeFi世界的大爆炸！\n\n第一个尝试DeFi的项目又是什么？其实是由Daniel Larimer（BM），Charles Hoskinson等人创建的Bitshares（中文名比特股BTS）。但理想丰满现实骨感，BTS的探索最终流产。后来，MakerDAO 的出现，才真正把DeFi推向了世界。 \n\n**第一把火（资产类）：MakerDao，被普遍认为「启动了 DeFi 运动的项目」。**\n\nMakerDAO 于2017年12月上线，是以太坊上的“去中心化银行”，其发行了稳定币DAI和管理型代币 MKR。其中，DAI作为整个DeFi生态系统的基石，运用了自动化超额抵押+目标利率的反馈机制，一度引领众多项目锁定在DeFi上的价值增长，是以太坊上规模最大和最久经考验的稳定币抵押解决方案。\n\n**第二把火（借贷类）：Compound，被称之为「进入DeFi领域的窗口」。**\n\nCompound成立于2018年9月，是目前DeFi借贷市场上最主要的抵押借贷平台。2020年6，Compound上线了平台治理代币COMP，价格从20美元一路飙升至320美金。借贷即挖矿机制让Compound一夜爆红，流量暴增，创造了又一个币圈神话。目前Compound市值已经“超车”DeFi的前任冠军Maker，成为成DeFi领头羊。\n\n **第三把火（交易所类）：DEX，去中心化交易所，无疑是「带动DeFi发展的基石」。**\n\nDEX是相对于中心化的加密货币交易平台而言的，以DEX为基础的去中心化交易所已经爆发出惊人的发展态势，如火爆的Bancor、Kyber，dYdX，DDEX，Uniswap等。DEX在2020年前六个月的总交易量超过30亿美元，与EOS去中心化交易所生态形成分庭抗礼之势。\n\n**第四把火(合成资产类)：Synthetix, 曾作为「DeFi市场最耀眼的新星」。**\n\n2019年，展露头角的合成资产平台 Synthetix, 不仅能够自行合成数位资产，也能通过虚拟货币购买法币、大宗商品、股票、指数等金融衍生品，其发行的代币 SNX 仅仅半年内飙涨近 800%, 2019 年 SNX 累计上涨 2872%。\n\n以上这4个项目都是比较有代表性类的项目，见证着DeFi 市场不断发展成熟。 \n \n\n***05应用***\n\n***DeFi创造区块链新世界***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IlBjiQSspCOxA3k94r4Wc.png?height=276&width=596)\n\n2020年是属于DeFi的高光时刻，DeFi的各类项目百花齐放，越来越多的应用和质押的代币数量爆发式增长，DeFi上的用户数量也已然10万余。 \n \n\n**1）丰富的各类应用场景**\n\n目前DeFi 的应用场景已经非常丰富，包含资产管理、借贷、稳定币、DEX、基础设施、预言机、分析工具、金融衍生品等各个领域。其中，借贷占据主要地位，然后是去中心化交易，以及衍生品交易。借贷主要以Maker、Compound、Aave等为主，而去中心化交易方面，以Bancor 、Kyber、Uniswap、Oasis为主，衍生品方面以Synthetix为主。\n\n同时，以太坊上的DeFi协议也已经应用在各种金融场景中。底层的一些流动性企业通过去中心化交易所来提供各种各样的流动性，借贷中可以添加杠杆合约，资产管理可发起去中心化的DeFi资产协议来进行管理；买保险也可以进行保险设置；可以把证券数字化后进行交易、预测；还可以把真实的黄金数字化，通过半中心化的信托来托管，从而在对应的链上创造出相应的货币或通证，然后在区块链上进行交易；还可以合成资产。 \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VpAxdtnHqQfbHbVj_EUii.png?height=517&width=1032)\n\n**2）可组合的开放金融服务** \n\nDeFi的应用其实已经形成了和传统金融世界一样的交易组合。除了以太坊之外，还有更多更好的新底层。加之，整个 DeFi 平台开放性很高，它有不同的合约在链上，合约和合约之间还能产生一个个交互。环环相扣的DeFi协议为开放金融服务提供了像乐高积木一样的可组合性——DeFi乐高。这就能创造出无数新赛道、新金融、新可能，打开了大众对区块链未来畅想的新大门！ \n \n\n***06风险***\n\n***DeFi的危机与困局*** \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZiGub97AoWkIlE8Tc4i1A.png?height=366&width=741)\n\n 2020年3月12日，ETH在一夜之间暴跌40%，由此引发大量DeFi头寸遭到清算，而Maker系统则从最初的盈余状态一瞬间转为负债400万DAI，一度崩溃，DeFi生态也因此经历了一场生死大考。\n\n \n 所以，DeFi作为加密货币市场的金融体系，虽然身处千亿级乃至万亿级蓝海市场，但受限于底层公链交互难、可抵押资产单一、产品操作繁琐等问题，依然面临着重重困难与危机。\n\n**目前DeFi的阻力最大的主要是两个**：用户链上资产的易操作性，以及智能合约的安全性。一方面，目前用户对链上资产认知较低，需要资产方和DeFi提供简易的操作流程和用户教育，才能尽快了解DeFi资产是如何操作的。另一方面，智能合约的安全可信，仍然是DeFi的达摩克利斯之剑，随时都可能产生系统性风险。\n\n此外，因币价波动导致的平台清算问题，因恐慌性挤兑带来的以太坊性能拥堵问题，因智能合约安全漏洞造成的黑客攻击问题，因乐高积木式组合潜在的系统性风控问题，因平台挤兑压力下的潜在跑路问题等诸多难题仍横亘眼前，DeFi能否持续开疆拓土，依然道阻且长。 \n \n\n***07前景***\n\n***DeFi重构世界金融***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rb2QTeVMJQEvvJ_VaebOw.png?height=279&width=626)\n\n 根据DeFi Pulse的数据，目前整个DeFi生态抵押的资产已超过了10亿美金，这一数据还在源源不断地提升。尽管目前DeFi依然处于商业模式的探索而非技术效率的提升阶段，相关金融模式和技术方案也还没有经历更复杂的市场环境考验，但显然DeFi 理财、资管、衍生品等各类新模式已经成为新的市场增长驱动引擎，创新正在使DeFi成为现实世界的用例。 \n\n**DeFi有潜力开创生产力的新时代。**随着DeFi的日渐成熟与区块链技术的迭代，DeFi将扮演更多、更重要的角色；随着越来越多的人都加入进来，它在人类历史上第一次将人们连接到复杂的金融设施和资本中，带来行业格局的重新分配，甚至主导未来“代码世界”的金融体系也未可知。 \n\n**DeFi 世界的人们希望重新构建金融服务业的雄心壮志，既是狂妄之梦，也是天才之想。**传统金融就是地球，DeFi 更像是在另一个平行宇宙里的潘多拉星球，所做的不是简单的提升金融效率，而是重新想象金钱, 重新构造金融。 \n\n无论如何，我们深处DeFi行业之中，就要经历其成长过程中可能发生的一切问题。这也是 DeFi 市场从小众走向主流，从草莽走向成熟必经之路。 \n \n\n**我们见证着历史，也在创造着历史，这一切美好又刺激，聒噪又曼妙。**\n\n \n **参考

Since then, various imitations of “Staking” have appeared.\n\nThe second wave, in June 2020, was when COMP, the lending platform, started the liquidity mining and DeFi became a hot spot once again.\n\nIn the third wave, in July 2020, AMPL pushed the concept of an algorithmic stable coin to a climax.\n\nThe fourth wave was in September 2020, with YFI and SushiSwap. The former being an aggregated yields farming platform and the latter launching the market-making mining.\n\nThe fifth wave, in March 2021, saw Uniswap and SushiSwap bring DEX and liquidity mining to the forefront again.\n\nBut DeFi’s innovation is far from over…\n\n# Rigid demand: cross-chain BTC\n\nBefore DeFi, each public chain went its own way, whether it was for payment settlement, games, or other types of applications, each used its own independent ecosystem on their corresponding public chain. However, after the rise of DeFi, cross-chain compatibility has become a rigid demand.\n\nTokens on different public chains need to be related to each other. For example, tokens from different public chains can create trading pools in DEX, participate in market making, stake or deposit tokens to other public chains for loans or participate in mining.\n\nHowever, BTC, as the king of crypto, and the coin with the strongest consensus, highest value, and strongest recognition, does not support smart contracts, making it impossible to establish DEX or participate in deposit loans on the BTC network. So, undoubtedly, to make BTC a cross-chain asset is the strongest rigid demand in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n# Current situation: risk and efficiency\n\n## How to build a cross-chain BTC?\n\nThe essence of BTC is the data in the decentralized ledger on the BTC blockchain, so only BTC on the BTC network can be recognized by popular consensus.\n\nIt is not possible to transfer BTC directly to other public chains. The essence of cross-chain BTC is to lock the BTC on the BTC network and then mint an equal amount of coins on other public chains. The BTC on the BTC chain is native BTC, and the BTC issued by cross-chain minting is cross-chain BTC, or you can call it BTC-pegged token.\n\n**•Centralized cross-chain minting**\n\nIn the minting process of the cross-chain BTC, the custody of the native BTC is crucial. With centralized minting, a single institution is responsible for holding the users’ native BTC and issuing cross-chain BTC.\n\nWBTC, imBTC, and HBTC are such centralized minted cross-chain BTC:\n\n➔ WBTC is a cross-chain BTC jointly issued by Kyber, Ren and BitGo.\n\n➔ imBTC is a cross-chain BTC issued by Tokenlon (a decentralized exchange).\n\n➔ HBTC is a cross-chain BTC issued by the Huobi Exchange.\n\n**•Decentralized cross-chain minting**\n\nDecentralized minting requires participation by multiple people, in a decentralized way, for the custody of native BTC and cross-chain BTC minting.\n\nrenBTC and tBTC are such decentralized minted cross-chain BTC:\n\n➔ renBTC performs BTC cross-chain minting and native BTC custody through the RenVM protocol.\n\n➔ tBTC performs BTC cross-chain minting and native BTC custody through multiple signatures.\n\n## Centralized risk of cross-chain BTC\n\nThe risk of BTC cross-chain lies in the custody of the native BTC. After all, native BTC is the real BTC.\n\nCentralized minting means the issuance of the cross-chain BTC is carried out by a single institution (usually a centralized institution), and the basis of issuance is credit.\n\nWBTC is issued on the basis of the credit of Kyber, Ren, and BitGo; imBTC is issued on the basis of the credit of Tokenlon; HBTC is issued on the basis of the credit of the Huobi platform. Therefore, cross-chain BTC issued by centralized minting is essentially a credit currency. This mechanism is similar to USDT.\n\nSince it is a credit currency, it is naturally exposed to credit risks:\n\n1\\.The risk of running away. If the centralized custodian embezzles the user’s native BTC, the consequences would be disastrous. Of course, the creditworthiness of these large institutions is still very high, but the loss would be extremely high if it really happens, although the probability of it happening may be considered to be low.\n\n2\\.The risk of misappropriation of funds. The native BTC pledged by users who want to get cross-chain BTC is kept by a single institution (i.e custodian). If it misappropriates the user’s native BTC, the user will not be able to redeem his or her BTC if the platform’s operation is not good. Similar to the previous example, these institutions and platforms are more creditworthy, so the probability of this happening is relatively low, but the capital at risk is still high.\n\n3\\.The risk of regulation. Remember when people were unable to make withdrawals from OKEX last year? The person in charge of OKex’s private key was taken away due to regulations, and as a result, users could not withdraw their money. Although most centralized minted coins are also executed across the chain through smart contracts, the custody of native BTC is ultimately centralized. Even if it is held using multiple signatures, 3 signatures are still centralized after all. This risk has a great degree of probability to occur.\n\n4\\.The risk of value manipulation. Centralized minters have the opportunity to mint a larger number of cross-chain coins on the basis of the number of native BTC locked. This will lead to an inflated quantity of BTC in the market, which on the one hand affects the price of BTC, and on the other hand, the inflated cross-chain BTC can manipulate the market in the cross-chain ecosystem. USDT may do the same thing. The risk of losses from this is hidden and the probability of occurrence is not large, after all, cross-chain BTC is different from USDT, and the quantity of native BTC is visible on the chain. Also, the market will be sensitive to such behavior.\n\n5\\.The risk of being attacked. With centralized minting, the custody of funds is more centralized, so there is the possibility of being attacked. Although WBTC keeps native BTC in cold wallets, there will always be a portion of BTC in hot wallets in order to meet the redemption demand of users, so it will still be exposed to the risk of being attacked. In addition to wallets, centralized minting is performed by a small number of minters for cross-chain procedures, and once attacked, users’ cross-chain needs may not be met for a short time, or they may even lose their funds. This risk should be temporary and small in scope, and the losses would not be too much, but the probability of occurrence is high.\n\n## Decentralization risk of BTC cross-chain\n\n**1.Risk of multiple signatures**\n\ntBTC has some randomness in managing users’ native BTC. When a user sends a cross-chain request, the tBTC system randomly assigns 3 minters (i.e., multi-signers) to generate a multi-signature address to accept the user’s native BTC. Only when all 3 minters (i.e., multi-signers) have signed can the native BTC in this multi-signer address be transferred.\n\nThe problem arises if several minters (i.e., multi-signers) join forces to act criminally together. If they are randomly assigned to the same group, they can take the native BTC that belongs to the user. Not only that, in the tBTC multi-signer mechanism, if a minter (i.e., multi-signer) has a problem, or if the network is blocked, or if the program crashes, or if there is a malicious attack, the signature would be delayed, then the user’s request may be locked, and it cannot be executed.\n\n**2.Liquidity risk**\n\nAlthough renBTC and tBTC are almost free from centralization risks, they pose volatility risks because they are collateralized by REN and ETH when they build cross-chain BTC.\n\nFor example, on May 19 of this year, when the price of coins collectively dived and the price of ETH and REN took a plunge, the total market value of REN tokens was once lower than the total value of the native BTC placed in custody. The over-collateralization that was used to secure the system no longer existed. At this point, for the minters of renBTC, giving up the collateralized REN and taking possession of the native BTC could have been more profitable. Although renBTC is decentralized, all the minters could ‘coincidentally’ choose to use such a strategy when the price of ren falls, and then the cross-chain users will suffer huge losses.\n\n## Capital efficiency issues\n\nDecentralized cross-chain minting is still risky, so the existing decentralized cross-chain BTC minting solutions required collateral issuance, to be precise — over-collateralization. This principle is similar to DAI.\n\nAs with DAI minting, building a decentralized cross-chain BTC requires over-collateralization. In the process of decentralized cross-chain minting, financial collateral is required from the minters to prevent them from committing fraud. For every 1 renBTC minted, the minters need to pledge ren tokens worth ≥ 3BTC, and for every tBTC minted, the minters need to pledge ETH worth ≥1.5BTC.\n\nThe problem here is the capital efficiency issue. In order to build cross-chain BTC, too much capital has to be pledged, resulting in inefficient capital utilization.\n\nAfter comparison, we found that the two forms of cross-chain BTC have their own advantages and disadvantages. Centralized cross-chain minting has higher risk, but also higher efficiency; while decentralized cross-chain minting has lower risk of the “single point of failure”, but also has the risk in multiple signatures, the risk in liquidity when the price of the collateral coin falls, and lower capital utilization efficiency.\n\nCross-chain BTC\n\n# Innovation: DeCus and eBTC\n\n## DeCus： Background and Strengths\n\nDeCus is a highly capital-efficient cross-chain custody platform dedicated to bringing Bitcoin and other assets into other public chains so that they can participate in the DeFi ecosystem of major public chains. According to the public information, DeCus has received investments from several institutions or communities, including Conflux, SevenX, DODO, dForce Labs, FBG Capital, Parallel ventures, and MCDEX. At the top of the list is Conflux.\n\nThe exact members of the team are not disclosed due to regulatory reasons in China. However, according to the DeCus official website and DeCus’ community’s confirmation, the core technical team of DeCus comes from the Tsinghua Yao family. The technical model of DeCus is derived from the paper of Dr. Yang Guang, the research director of Conflux, which is published in arXiv, and the paper is about a secure and efficient hosting model.\n\n## eBTC: Secure and Efficient\n\neBTC is the first product of the DeCus system, a decentralized cross-chain BTC issued on the Ethereum network. eBTC has better security and higher efficiency of capital utilization compared with previous cross-chain BTCs. This is in line with the theme of Dr. Yang Guang’s thesis — security and efficiency.\n\n**Decentralized cross-chain minting**\n\nFirst of all, eBTC is a cross-chain BTC minted in a decentralized way. The following diagram is the description of the eBTC cross-chain process on the DeCus official website.\n\nDecus\n\nA number of custodians hold the multiple signature addresses in a decentralized manner, and it needs more than one-half of the signatures to execute a transfer request. Accepting cross-chain requests, minting coins, and sending eBTC are then executed by a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe minting is carried out by the smart contract, and multiple people hold the user’s native BTC in a decentralized manner, therefore eBTC is virtually free of the centralization risks discussed earlier.\n\n**BTC as collateral**\n\nAs you can see, minting is executed through smart contracts in the cross-chain process, and there is no centralization risk. Besides, the native BTC transferred by users is held by a group of custodians who are randomly selected, which is the key feature to eBTC with decentralized minting.\n\nTo act as an eBTC custodian, BTC must be pledged into the system as collateral, and if the custodian tries to abuse his position, his collateralized BTC will be confiscated.\n\n**Multiple signatures**\n\nDeCus holds native BTC in groups by means of multiple signatures, and only when more than one-half of the custodians sign can the BTC be dominated.\n\nAssume that there are 6 custodians holding native BTC in groups of 3, with each group sharing custody of multi-signature addresses. By having multiple signatures to keep the native BTC in their addresses, only 2 signatures can execute the transfer, and if only 1 person signs, the number of signatures is less than one-half, so nothing can be transferred, which means if only 1 person abuses the system, it cannot affect the DeCus system security at all.\n\n**BTC custodian overlap grouping**\n\nWhat if there are 2 people teaming up to commit fraud?\n\nDeCus has designed a clever decentralized technical model for eBTC — overlapping grouping. To facilitate record keeping, the 6 custodians are represented by ABCDEF in groups of 3, and each custodian can overlap to join a different group. Thus, these 6 individuals would form 20 groupings like this:\n\nABC ABD ABE ABF\n\nACD ACE ACF\n\nADE ADF\n\nAEF\n\nBCD BCE BCF\n\nBDE BDF\n\nBEF\n\nCDE CDF\n\nCEF\n\nDEF\n\nAssuming that 2 of these 6 custodians, AB, team up to commit fraud, then only the group in which both are involved can be controlled. That is, the 4 groups ABC ABD ABE ABF will be attacked by the duo teaming up, which means that only the multi-signature addresses kept by these 4 groups will be influenced.\n\nWhen accepting cross-chain requests, the smart contract will assign a multi-signature address to the user based on the BTC custody situation of each grouping, which will eventually keep the number of BTC in custody of each custodian group equal.\n\nAssuming that each group keeps the same amount of BTC, then when A and B join forces to commit fraud, they can dominate 4 of the 20 groups, i.e., 1/5 of the native BTC will be stolen by A and B joining forces. However, don’t forget that A and B as custodians have also pledge BTC as collateral. There are 6 custodians in total, and the BTC collateralized by the AB duo accounts for 1/3 but only 1/5 of the BTC get stolen.\n\nTo put it in more detail, if there is a total of 30 BTC in the custody pool, then AB teamed up to steal 30/5 = 6 BTC. So, in order to prevent A and B from working together, the two of them can’t collateralize less than 6 BTC, so the total collateralized assets of the 6 custodians can’t be less than 18 BTC.\n\nThus, we see that 18 or more BTC are collateralized and 30 BTC are held in custody, i.e. 30 eBTC are issued. The collateralization rate is ≥ 60%, which is much smaller than the collateralization rate of renBTC and eBTC.\n\nIn fact, there are not actually only 6 custodians in the DeCus system. Using the previous method, let’s calculate the safe collateralization rate when the total number of custodians increase.\n\nIf there are 9 custodians, with 3 people in a group, there will be a total of 84 groups, if 2 people work together to commit fraud, they can control 7 groups and steal 7/84 of the BTC in custody, and the collateralized assets of these two are 2/9. This requires a secured collateralization rate of ≥ 37.5%.\n\nIf there are 50 custodians, with 3 people in a group, there will be a total of 19,600 groups, if 2 people work together to commit fraud, they can control 48 groups and steal 48/19,600 BTC in custody, and the collateral assets of these two people account for 2/50, so the required security collateralization rate ≥ 6.13%.\n\nOf course, in the DeCus system, the number of BTC under the custody of each grouping cannot be exactly equal, so the actual collateralization rate of the DeCus system will be somewhat higher than that calculated by the model. But what is certain is that the more custodians there are, the lower the security collateralization rate will be.\n\nObviously, when there are enough custodians, it is possible to increase the group capacity, not necessarily having 3 people in a group, but groups of 5, 7, or more. According to the official information published by DeCus, the collateralization rate of DeCus can be as low as 20%.\n\nSo, we see that eBTC has a lower collateral rate and higher efficiency of capital utilization while still ensuring security.\n\n## Questions and Outlook\n\nI have studied the DeCus model. The design of this model has an assumption that each multi-signature group keeps an equal amount of BTC. In reality, it is impossible for each group to have an equal number of BTC in their custody. This requires the smart contract to assign the custodian groups when it receives a cross-chain request from a user and tries to keep the number of BTC in each group as equal as possible. If there is a large cross-chain request, my guess is that the user needs to transfer money to multiple multi-signature addresses. So, where is the list of BTC addresses maintained by these multi-signature groups kept? On a centralized server or written to the Ethereum blockchain? If DeCus runs an Ethernet virtual machine, the security is higher, otherwise, there is still the possibility of it being attacked when assigning custodian groups to cross-chain users.\n\nOf course, with the technical strength of the Tsinghua Yao family, it is highly likely that I am overthinking this. But all in all, I believe that DeCus also needs a code security audit to specifically confirm the level of security. If the DeCus code security audit is passed, DeCus will be a very cleverly designed cross-chain system, and eBTC will definitely have a place in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe DeCus system can be understood as a cross-chain protocol, and a stable coin system pegged to BTC. In the DeFi segment, after experiencing hot spots such as lending platforms, algorithmic stable coins, aggregated DeFi, and liquidity mining, can cross-chain DeFi or pegged assets trigger a new round of hot spots?\n\nThis question is currently unanswered. However, cross-chain BTC will definitely be an essential and important part of the DeFi ecosystem. Compared with other cross-chain BTC, the design of eBTC has some obvious advantages.\n\nCompared to centralized cross-chain BTCs like WBTC, imBTC, and HBTC, renBTC and tBTC are minted in a decentralized way across chains, reducing the risk of centralization.\n\nHowever, the over-collateralization of renBTC and tBTC makes the cross-chain minting process more inefficient in terms of capital utilization and has a liquidity risk when the price of the collateralized coins falls.\n\nDeCus System’s eBTC, again, is decentralized cross-chain minting. The use of BTC as collateral, therefore, eliminates the liquidity risk created by fluctuations in collateral assets.\n\nComparison of Cross-Chain BTC\n\nIts biggest innovation is the use of overlapping groupings for multiple signatures to hold native BTC, thus reducing the collateral rate and increasing the efficiency of capital utilization while ensuring security.\n\nThe lower collateral rate will attract more investors to compete for DeCus custodians and participate in eBTC minting, so eBTC may have stronger competitiveness in the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. In turn, higher capital utilization will eventually bring value back to the DeFi market. People who participate in minting can use more funds for buying coins, market making, and other scenarios, thus gaining more profit opportunities.", "timestamp": 1633787928, "digest": "URG_Ouw4y3osHZzl3XPcEHS10eN5G3KKC_UU8PgMgnE", "contributor": "0xcEEa0F2068c47534043c48ea4eD1940D3df43AaD"}

DeFi生态则实现了从无到有的突破；\n\n3、流通市值和锁仓金额的比值（Mcap/TVL）反映了市场对于DeFi产品单位流量的估值水平，指标越低代表资产价格风险响度越低，指标越高代表价格风险相对越高；按照Mcap/TVL比值来看，9月，Solana和Avalache DeFi资产价格明显处于高风险状态；\n\n \n \n\n4、尽管以太坊等DeFi生态处于平稳期，但在DeFi不同的细分领域仍有新的品类或者新的模式出现，按照业务规模和估值风险的标准也能达到或超越新兴公链DeFi项目的标准\n\n \n \n\n**一、基本思路**\n\nDeFi项目的显著特点在于通过金融逻辑赋予Token实际的使用价值，这种使用价值主要基于数字资产的资产属性产生，而和其功能属性无关，因此，DeFi对于数字资产的赋能是普遍性的；基于DeFi产品，数字资产可以产生和资产价格涨跌无关的“无风险收益”，进而使得数字资产可以采用传统金融中收益和市值类相关指标进行估值；新的估值体系的建立有助于数字资产建立新的共识和“破圈”。针对DeFi赛道的分析逻辑主要体现为以下两点： \n \n\n1、从业务规模和收入规模对DeFi资产进行估值分析，对公链资产（Gas费资产）和DeFi资产的需求进行分析\n\n2、从业务规模的变化，既通过区分“流量和市值的叠加期”和“市值对流量的报复期”，来分析DeFi资产和公链资产的市值变化周期 \n **二、整体情况** \n 不论去中心化交易所，还是借贷类项目往往都基于资金池模式提供服务，因此，总锁仓金额（TVL，Total Volume Locked )成为反映DeFi类项目业务规模的通用指标。根据DeFillama数据，2021年9月30日，36条公链DeFi项目总锁仓金额（TVL）为176B，相对于8月31日增幅为-3.54%，从TVL金额反映的业务规模上来看，DeFi整体处于收缩状态。从1-9月DeFi业务规模来看（图1），4月是DeFi赛道的一个高峰，经历了5月市场的回调之后，8月市场再次迎来反弹，但9月反弹没有延续，而是开始再回调。\n\n**三、生态分析**\n\n**1、月度赢家**\n\n源于以太坊，但已经走出以太坊，目前，多链生态是DeFi的重要特征，也是市场增量的主要来源。2021年9月30日，按照DeFi项目加总 TVL排名，共有11条公链承载的DeFi项目TVL超过10亿美元，其中，排名第一的以太坊DeFi生态TVL达123.95 B，在整体DeFi市场中占比为71.68%，相对于8月31日，TVL增加1.51 B，但占比下降近6个百分点；排名分别为第2和第6的币安智能链和Polygon也经历了类似的情况，9月TVL的绝对数值和占比均出现了下滑。\n\n9月DeFi赛道的最大赢家应该非Solana莫属，Solana DeFi生态TVL从3.33B增长到8.95B，增长了2.68倍，Solana DeFi生态TVL在多链DeFi中的占比也从2.06%增长为6.44%，按照TVL规模排名，Solana DeFi生态成为仅次于以太坊和币安智能链的第三大生态。此外，Fantom、Avalache、Terra DeFi生态TVL均实现了增长，增幅分别为176%、76%和9%，Arbitrum、OkexChain和Claytn DeFi生态TVL均获得了突破性增长，几乎都是从0增长到10亿美元，生态扩张之路已经启动。\n\n \n \n\n**2、风险提示**\n\nMcap反映了项目的流通市值，而Mcap/TVL反映了市场对于DeFi产品单位流量的估值水平，指标越低代表资产溢价程度越低，价格风险相对越低；指标越高代表资产的溢价程度越高，价格风险相对越高。本文以以太坊DeFi生态的Mcap/TVL为基准，Mcap/T\n\nVL指标高于以太坊值的，则视为估值风险高；Mcap/TVL指标低于以太坊值的，则视为估值风险低；按此标准，Solana和Avalache都处于高风险状态，SOL和该生态的主要DeFi资产均处于搞估值风险状态，相对而言，Terra和Fantom则处于低风险状态。 \n \n\n**3、重点生态**\n\n1）Fantom\n\n* 项目简介：\n\n全球首个基于 DAG 技术并支持智能合约的高性能公链，致力于解决现存区块链技术的可拓展性和处理时间的问题。Fantom 上线了涵盖借贷、借款和合成资产的全功能 DeFi 套件 Fantom Finance，主要包括 fMint、fSwap 和 fLend 三个板块，其中，在 fMint

亿美元的资金用于宣传、资助和激励措施，包含Aave、Curve、Sushi、PoolTogether、0x、UMA、Valora、Ubeswap、Moola Market 在内的创始合作伙伴，以及 Chainlink、RabbitHole、The Graph 和 Wrapped.com 在内的教育宣传和基础设施合作伙伴。\n\nCelo 将于三季度推出跨链通信互操作机制 Optics，实现以太坊和 Celo 间的资产交易。\n\n**四、项目分析**\n\n本文依然按照业务规模和估值风险的思路，针对多链DeFi项目进行分析。根据前文生态分析的相关结论，Fantom、Terra、Arbitrum、OkexChain和Claytn DeFi生态处于上升期，其中Arbitrum属于以太坊二层网络，基于其搭建的项目主要是以太坊DeFi项目的一种扩展，由于Arbitrum相对以太坊DeFi业务整体规模非常有限，因此Arbitrum生态DeFi项目估值主要仍受以太坊业务数据影响；关于新兴DeFi生态，本文重点分析Fantom、Terra和OkexChain DeFi生态项目。此外，尽管以太坊等DeFi生态处于平稳期，但在DeFi不同的细分领域仍有新的品类或者新的模式出现，按照业务规模和估值风险的标准也能达到或超越新兴公链DeFi项目的标准，本文也将进行具体分析。\n\n**1、Fantom生态项目**\n\n1）BOO\n\nSpookySwap是Fantom上的AMM

项目简介：\n\nCherrySwap是基于OKExchain自动做市协议，采用自动做市商机制（AMM），旨在以流动性挖矿、IFO、NFT、彩票、DAO等多元化功能，实现自驱式的流动性创造，给予参与者最大价值红利 。\n\n* 最新进展：\n\n8月26日，为适应GameFi生态的发展需要，CherrySwap即将启动CHE代币经济学模型优化升级的设计工作，主要包括CHE总量缩减、CHE减产（减产将在Gamefi正式上线后开启），以及基于Gamefi的子币发行计划。 \n \n\n**4、以太坊项目**\n\n1）Dydx\n\n* 项目简介：\n\ndydx 是订单簿式期货 Dex，也是目前去中心化期货赛道龙头。目前产品包括永续合约、保证金交易、杠杆交易、现货交易和借贷。8月开始，dydx启动了长达5年时间的交易挖矿激励，5年时间共分为 60 个 周期，每个周期28天，每个周期分发 383.5 万枚平台通证 DYDX，以激励用户在该协议进行交易。\n\n* 经济模型\n\nDYDX 总量 10 亿枚，50%用于社区激励，其中，25%用于交易挖矿，7.5%用于早期用户空投，7.5%用于DYDX代币交易的流动性挖矿奖励，5%用于社区金库， 2.5%用于质押 USDC 的期货流动性挖矿奖励，2.5%用于保险池 Staking 的用户激励；27.73%分配至各类投资者；15.27% 分配至dydx Trading 或基金会的创始人、员工、顾问；7.00% 用于未来员工激励。\n\n* 风险\n\n交易挖矿的激励模式或难以实现可持续增长，一旦 DYDX 价格下跌，套利效应消失，协议的交易量极可能快速下滑，并导致 DYDX 跌幅扩大，陷入「死亡螺旋」\n\n2）CVX\n\n* 项目简介：\n\nConvex Finance 个旨在通过简单易用的界面，提高 CRV 持币者、流动性提供者的报酬。其旨在借助 CVX 代币，简化 Curve 和 CRV 锁定、质押的过程。Convex 旨在简化此过程，促进 CRV 生态系统发展。\n\n* 代币模型\n\nCVX 是 Convex 的原生代币，最大供应量为 1 亿枚，用于捕获 Convex 的平台费用收入（将有 16% 的总平台费用，10% 给 cvxCRV 质押者，5% 给 CVX 持有者，1% 将用于归集收益奖励的操作——用于调用合约以收集和分配奖励的 Gas 费用。）\n\n而 CVX 具体分发安排如下：\n\n* 50%（5000 万枚）是 Curve LP 奖励，按比例直接分发；\n* 25%（2500 万枚）用于流动性挖矿奖励，支持 CVX/ETH 和 cvxCRV/CRV 交易池，分发期为 4 年；\n* 10% （1000 万枚）是 Convex 创始团队激励，在产品上线后锁定一年 ;\n* 9.7%（970 万枚）作为国库储备，锁定一年，用于未来的社区激励或其他社区活动；\n* 3.3%（330 万枚）分发给投资者，全部锁定一年（此部分 CVX 没有 cvxCRV 铸造） ；\n* 1%（100 万枚）的 CVX 被空投给 veCRV 代币持有者；\n* 1%（100 万枚）的 CVX 奖励给参与 Curve.fi 治理投票（即支持将 Convex 列入 Curve.fi 白名单）的用户；\n\n   \n \n\n3）INST\n\n* 简介：\n\nInstaDApp是一个借贷资产管理聚合器，平台上有Aave，Compound与MakerDao三大借贷协议。用户可在该平台上实现一站式管理自己的借贷资产，包括杠杆，债务互换以及自动再融资，不仅操作起来十分方便，而且还能为用户减少gas费用。\n\n* 代币模型：\n\n代币INST，总量1亿枚，其中，社区成员分配55%(解锁计划未公开)，现任团队成员分配23.79%（四年解锁期），投资者12.07%（四年解锁期），未来团队成员及生态合作伙伴7.85%；顾问1.27%（四年解锁期）。 \n \n\n**五、月度总结**\n\nDeFi之于区块链在于通过金融逻辑赋予Token实际的使用价值，此类使用价值可以使DeFi资产产生“无风险收益”，以追求此类“无风险收益”为目的的挖矿行为，不仅产生挖矿流量和数字资产市值增长形成的叠加效应，也产生挖矿流量停止增长导致的资产市值快速下跌；从以太坊到BSC，再到Matic，以及9月的Solana都是这一规律的不断重演。\n\n多链DeFi是目前DeFi赛道一个重要的特征，也是增量流量的主要来源；从TVL规模增长来看，9月DeFi的明星生态非Solana莫属，此外，Fantom、Avalache、Terra DeFi生态均实现了增长，Arbitrum、OkexChain和Claytn DeFi生态TVL均获得了突破，生态扩张之路已经启动；但从Mcap/TVL即单位流量市场给予的估值水平来看，Solana和Avalache都处于高风险状态，相对而言，Terra和Fantom则处于低风险状态。\n\n尽管以太坊DeFi生态进入平稳期，但dydx通过开创新的衍生品细分赛道仍然在9月获得了较大增长，多链DeFi和以太坊创新模式都将成为下一步DeFi扩展的有力支撑。",

{"id": "BSc6hr7f0naUsnVmeTZVtnvJvaqJsiVWVpkiqWW4_QA", "title": "Nansen 分析 Fantom 崛起之路：合约部署活动、稳定币及 Smart Money", "body": "### 介绍\n\n速度、安全性、去中心化——是围绕区块链的三个关键要素，同时也被称为是区块链的「不可能三角」（Trilemma），如果想要协调好这三者之间的关系，并获得平衡被认为是不可能的事。不过，随着 Fantom 的到来，这一切正在被改变。Fantom 就是为了平衡这三大要素而打造的，旨在引领 DeFi 行业解决这个看似不可能解决的问题。\n\n### 什么是 Fantom？\n\nFantom 是一个高度可扩展的区块链平台，适用于 DeFi、crypto DApp、以及企业解决方案，旨在通过使用 Lachesis 协议来突破「老牌」区块链设置的限制，这是一种定制的异步拜占庭容错 (aBFT) 共识机制，相比于那些建立在以前共识算法上的区块链，Fantom 的链上处理速度更快、更安全、也更具可扩展性。\n\n为了顺应未来的多链趋势，Fantom 已通过桥接将各种链纳入其网络，例如以太坊、BSC、Polygon 和 Avalanche。目前，SushiSwap 和 Curve 等 主要的以太坊项目已经迁移到 Fantom，流量也被顺势引入。另一方面，SpookySwap——Fantom 链上首个原生收益耕作农场及 AMM DEX——目前已经获得了极大人气，在锁仓量排行榜中仅次于 AnySwap，领先于 Curve 和 Beefy Finance。\n\n### 交易和 Gas 费用\n\n自从 2020 年夏天 DeFi 兴起以来，我们见证了以太坊上的 Gas 费用因网络拥堵而出现巨大波动，不断增加的网络需求迫使用户不得不承担过于昂贵的交易费用，更无法激励开发人员进行参与建设。从下图中，我们可以看到在过去的 2 年时间里，以太坊 Gas 费用中位数已经大幅上涨，因此现在急需对网络进行进行扩展，且制定出与以太坊兼容的解决方案。\n\n*上图：以太坊 Gas 费用中位数价格 (Gwei)*\n\n虽然 Fantom 上的每个网络都是按不同规模进行独立独立构建，但它们有一个共同功能，即：提高性能并减少拥堵。此外，Fantom 主网使用的是以太坊虚拟机（EVM），这样可以与以太坊兼容，这种兼容性能使开发人员能够进行快速迁移，体验更高的性能和更低的成本。\n\n如下图所示，就在 2021 年 8 月下旬 Fantom 宣布推出价值 3.7 亿美元的流动性挖矿激励计划之后，Fantom 上的交易数量在 9 月超越了以太坊。与此同时，我们发现 Fantom 上日均 gas 费用要远低于以太坊网络，之所以会出现这种情况，是由于 Fantom 本身就是基于较低交易成本而构建的。\n\n*上图：ETH 交易量 vs. FTM 交易量*\n\n*上图：Eth 日均 Gas 费用 vs. FTM 日均 Gas 费用*\n\n### 合约部署活动\n\n合约部署活动是评估区块链项目开发效果的一个指标，与 Fantom 区块链相比，以太坊区块链上合约部署活动水平通常更高，因为目前在以太坊上构建的项目也更多。\n\n下图中较为清楚地展示了这种现象，其中展示了以太坊和 Fantom 上的合约部署数量。我们看到，6 月初，以太坊合约部署数量达到峰值，一天内就部署了超过 24 万份合约。但是此后，合约部署活动开始下降并稳定在每天 2 万份以下。另一方面，Fantom 在宣布其流动性挖矿激励计划后，其合约部署活动在 2021 年 9 月初出现了激增，峰值为每天部署约 1.28 万份合约。值得注意的是，在此期间 Fantom 的合约部署活跃度是高于以太坊的。\n\n另一个值得关注的指标是合约部署率，其计算方法是将 Fantom 上的合约部署量除以以太坊上的合约部署量——我们可以看到，随着时间的推移， Fantom 部署率一直在增加，并且出现了一些峰值。而在 Fantom 的合约部署活动超越以太坊期间，该比率达到了 1.26，这意味着每部署 1 个以太坊合约，Fantom 上就会部署 1.26 个合约。然而，随着以太坊合约部署活动逐渐上升，最近合约部署率基本上徘徊在 0.1 左右。\n\n*上图：合约部署活动 FTM vs ETH*\n\n*上图：合约部署率 FTM vs ETH*\n\n### Smart Money\n\n如果您熟悉 Nansen 的话，那么对我们的 Smart Money 这个钱包分析标签应该比较熟悉了。Smart Money 是 Nansen 旗下数据分析服务的一个指标标签，其他一些指标标签还包括了 Smart LP、Flash Boys、Whales、Funds 等，在 [此处](https://www.notion.so/Wallet-Labels-Emojis-What-do-they-mean-f55ee986ee724f4ab864a6a9c90207cf) 可查看相关钱包标签的定义。\n\nSmart money 交互可以看作是评估某个项目 / 协议的积极指标之一，因为该指标能清楚地表明经验丰富的投资者的兴趣所在。不出所料，随着 Fantom 越来越受欢迎，以及 SushiSwap、Beefy Finance 和 Curve 等知名协议迁移到 Fantom 上，数据显示已有相当数量的 Smart money 地址与 Fantom 和以太坊相关。\n\n从下图中，我们可以看到 Flash Boys （在单笔交易中进行多次 DEX 交易的钱包，是一个评估快速获利的指标标签）在 Fantom 和以太坊上的重合率最大（达到 24.2%）。此外，Smart LP、其他钱包和 Funds 三个指标标签都分别有 13.3%、7.1% 和 0.9% 的重合率。\n\n如果我们将这些数字与币安智能链上的数字进行比较，那么可以发现，Fantom 上的 Smart Money 重叠率要低得多，这也许暗示了 Fantom 仍处于采用 Smart Money 的早期阶段。\n\n*上图：FTM & ETH 上的 Smart Money 分布图*\n\n*上图：不同指标标签的 Smart Money 重合率*\n\n### 稳定币\n\n在以太坊网络上，Tether (USDT) 是目前市值最高的稳定币，并以巨大的市场优势主导着稳定币流通。就交易量而言，USDT 的交易量几乎是 USDC 和 DAI 总和的两倍。然而，在 Fantom 网络上，占据主导地位的稳定币却是 USDC 和 DAI，USDT 位列第三，这表明在 Fantom 上尚未出现占据主导地位的稳定币市场领导者，因此关注下未来稳定币在 Fantom 上的表现一定会很有趣。\n\n在 Fantom 上 USDC 和 DAI 在交易量方面处于领先位置，如下图所示，USDC 在交易数量和日均活跃用户方面均遥遥领先，从这可以看出，USDC 是 Fantom 区块链上的首选稳定币。\n\nFantom 区块链上稳定币活动的飙升势头表明其使用率正在逐渐增加，尤其是 Fantom 在 9 月宣布了流动性挖矿激励计划之后，使得该月稳定币活动呈爆炸性增长。稳定币数量的增加是一个积极的指标，因为这意味着 Fantom 链上拥有充足的流动性，用户可以采用比以太坊主网上更加复杂的策略，而且成本更低，速度明显更快。然而，在 9 月下旬，也就是整个加密货币市场出现下滑期间，Fantom 上的稳定币活动同样没有逃过下降的命运。\n\n*上图：Fantom 日均链上稳定币交易量*\n\n*上图：Fantom 稳定币日活跃交易发送方数量*\n\n*上图：Fantom 稳定币每日交易量*\n\n### Fantom 稳定币交易量的价值分布\n\n稳定币交易平均值是评估 Fantom 用户资本 / 钱包规模的一个很好指标，在 Nansen 的稳定币后台可以看到，随着时间的推移，交易规模的价值分布呈现出了一幅有趣的图像（如下图所示）。\n\n9 月，Fantom 上稳定币的交易量非常大。有趣的是，超过 10 万美元的大额交易比例一直在上升。此外，超过 100 万美元的交易一直占据着区块链上所有交易量的 90% 以上。这或许是因为受流动性挖掘计划的激励，资金开始逐渐涌入。\n\n*上图：Fantom 上随时间电话的稳定币数量价值分布情况*\n\n### 结论\n\n随着 DeFi 在过去 12 个月的飞速增长，如今行业内面临的最大问题之一就是当前基础设施能否跟上不断增长的需求。现阶段，许多 Layer 1 和 Layer 2 解决方案提出了不少创新方法，并尝试以此来解决区块链在传统共识算法上运行的各种问题，这些解决方案正在激烈争夺市场主导地位。\n\n为了吸引用户使用，这些解决方案的早期版本通常会使用流动性挖矿激励措施，但随着这些激励措施逐渐失去作用，那些能够解决「不可能三角」问题的区块链开始脱颖而出，Fantom 会成为未来更受欢迎的 Layer 1 之一吗？ 或许只有时间能够给出答案。", "timestamp": 1633791893, "digest": "uoD2tx3J1G7Q_SHQYiFS6sSEQYww-Uv75AL7XwA8t2s", "contributor": "0xcCFc3626e9A5335Ed1bD0854E3D0Ea9A2ad4a436"}

Come una forma-pensiero senziente e collettiva Ethereum ha la capacità di fagocitare i propri fallimenti,acquisire forza e refrattarietà da essi come in una sorta di processo alchemico dove il male è talvolta necessario a produrre il bene.\n\nCosi nascono le ICO, ( initial coin offering) la prima generazione di smart-contract ( contratti scritti in codice informatico che prevedono un esecuzione automatica al verificarsi di certe condizioni) che rendono possibile la raccolta di capitali in maniera disintermediata e permissionless. L’impatto è travolgente tanto da spingere l’intero mondo crypto fuori dalla sua dimensione di nicchia per catapultarlo in modo caotico nel mainstream che non ne comprende le distorsioni e si ritrova intrappolato nell’euforia speculativa,confermando uno schema già consolidato nei mercati finanziari,soprattutto quando sono chiamati in causa prodotti innovativi profondamente disruptive con implicazioni sull’ infrasruttura finanziaria ,sulle dinamiche e interazioni sociali, e sulla politica monetaria globale. Dicono che le bolle finanziarie si creano quando persone con obbiettivi diversi sono convinte di giocare la stessa partita ed anche se non tutto può essere liquidato come semplicemente irrazionale,di li a poco il mercato crypto entra in una fase depressiva (2018). Segue una repentina caduta dei prezzi,lo sporco viene a galla e ci si muove in acque torbide,il settore deve scontare e smaltire la sua dose di avidità e imperizia. Ethereum viene testato nuovamente senza compromessi, ha il compito più gravoso dell’ecosistema,essendo la piattaforma principale in grado di offrire l’ambiente e gli strumenti necessari al lancio e alla raccolta fondi della maggior parte dei progetti crypto nel periodo 2016–2018. Ethereum si ritrova a scontrarsi con gli eccessi di una una fase ‘bulimica’ i quali fanno emergere i limiti di una scalabilità inadeguata per quelle che sono le sue aspirazioni.

{"id": "g8peAHA-wqrBJqDRMFLtZwJSwP3NQ0Ku82JOAVCP1LU", "title": "生成艺术家 0xDEAFBEEF 访谈：如何在生成艺术领域无穷探索", "body": "自 2021 年初以来，名为「0xDEAFBEEF」的艺术家通过用文本编辑器、C 语言编译器和以太坊区块链这些最简单的工具，制作的一系列开创性视听作品，吸引了 NFT 社区的极大的注意力。0xDEAFBEEF 加入了从 [Art Blocks](https://artblocks.io/) 到 [Autoglyphs](https://www.larvalabs.com/autoglyphs) 的一系列链上生成艺术的核心阵地， 积极探索他的媒介可编程潜力。今年 4 月，他发布了名为「[Entropy](https://www.deafbeef.com/series/3)」 系列。在该系列中，与每个代币相伴的媒体随着每次代币转移而退化。最近他又发布了两个系列「 [Glitchbox](https://www.deafbeef.com/series/4) 」和「[Advection](https://www.deafbeef.com/series/5)」，这两个新系列 中，他允许用户通过改变链上参数来「策划」作品。 0xDEAFBEEF 充分利用了自己软件工程和计算机图形研究的背景，并与自学的锻造技能相结合，他被比喻成「数字工匠」，为 NFT 打造了一系列新的创意可能性。\n\n关于 NFT 和数字艺术领域的媒体「JPG」的联合创始人 Sam Spike 最近采访了 0xDEAFBEEF，二人讨论了在生成艺术领域进行的实践、视听媒体的独特力量，以及新技术对文化发展的影响等话题。\n\n*系列 3 — Entropy*\n\n**Sam Spike： 你会如何向别人介绍链上生成艺术？有没有特别的艺术家或项目引起了你的注意？**\n\n**0xDEAFBEEF：**总的来说，生成和编程艺术是我从小就一直感兴趣的东西。我是通过玩 ASCII 地牢爬行游戏（如 Rogue 和 Nethack）而了解它的，这些游戏通过程序生成可重玩的关卡。我发现这让人非常着迷，为了这一目地，在我的青年时代学习编程。\n\n至于链上生成艺术，特别需要说的是，当我第一次尝试理解 NFT 时，遇到的是 Autoglyphs 项目，但我并没有太注意这些作品，因为我认为这种输出很简单。之后我才了解到，它们是第一个完全用 Solidity 编写的 NFT 项目，这样才理解了这些作品的重要性。\n\n2 月中旬，我发现了 Art Blocks 很棒，并希望加入。不过当时候补名单太长了，客户端 javascript 不支持我的工作，我决定开发自己的系统，直接支持我一直以来的工作方式，使用独立的 C 代码。\n\n**Sam Spike： 成为一名生成艺术家意味着同时追求秩序和混乱。你正在制定规则来决定作品的总体形状，但随后将其最终形式留给了机会，或者就你最近的两个系列而言，留给其他人。你为什么选择这样的工作方式？**\n\n**0xDEAFBEEF：**我相信几乎每位生成艺术家都会同意：探索设计空间是一种非常有益的体验。设计一个系统，而不是一个单一的结果，既有趣又具有挑战性，总有机会诞生惊喜。有了足够的参数，一个人就很难探索该设计空间内的所有有趣的角落。因此，通过 Glitchbox 的协作机能，看到其他人所选择的独特且出乎意料的方向，是非常有益的。\n\n我应该补充一点，我围绕生成艺术和音乐的许多互动，都来自那些想要参与并开始创作自己作品的人。从某种意义上说，Glitchbox 允许这样做。用户最常见的反馈是它很有趣，并激励他们进一步探索。\n\n话虽如此，我不认为生成艺术与某些传统艺术过程有非常大的不同。艺术家并不总是在胸有成竹的情况下才开始其创作过程。艺术品是通过观察和决定下一步采取什么行动的迭代过程而「成长」的。\n\n**Sam Spike：你作品中反复出现的主题似乎是对永恒的迷恋。你用 C 语言编写模型并将它们完全存储在链上，以尽可能减少依赖关系。你还说过，你喜欢锻造的原因是打造的这些工具数百年来没有发生变化。同时，你的作品有意唤起有关古老且过时技术（如模拟合成器、早期计算机图形等）的声音和图像。 你如何解释这种艺术张力？**\n\n**0xDEAFBEEF：**我认为，与其说这些东西已经过时，不如说它们是基本的，因为它们更接近支配它们的底层科学和数学原理。对我来说，了解信号和信息是如何存储、处理和感知的，比你当时碰巧使用的任何机器都更重要。\n\n打个比方：任何机械师都可以轻松维修大众面包车，而包含许多微处理器的现代车辆需要制造商所提供的专用工具。在后一个例子中，与基础科学和物理系统的底层联系，被额外的复杂层所掩盖。只要这些复杂的层次得到强大的支持，现代车辆就会更有效率，因为它不需要用户掌握特殊知识。 但现代车辆也更脆弱。当世界继续前进时，它就变得真正过时了。\n\n你的旧智能手机是垃圾。而另一方面，模拟信号处理器可以被修理、重新利用和清理出零件。示波器仍然是电气工程师的有用工具。60 年代的黑胶唱片和磁带录音仍然可以播放。对于那些知道如何使用它们的人来说，ASCII 终端屏幕仍然是与计算机进行许多任务交互的最有效方式。\n\n当然，我理解在时间和便利之间的权衡取舍，但我为自己选择了这种方法。与其浪费大量时间适应（昙花一现的）平台和技术，我宁愿将时间投入到基础知识上。无论结果如何，以这种方式花费的时间都不会是浪费。\n\n*系列 2 — Transmission*\n\n**Sam Spike：你在自己的网站上写道，你的第一个系列 [Synth Poems](https://www.deafbeef.com/series/0) 是「以音频为中心的」。 但在 [Transmission](https://www.deafbeef.com/series/2) 系列中，你通过巧妙地结合反映当下时代的词语，如「假新闻」、「新常态」，赋予了视觉元素更多的意义。在创作新作品时，你如何看待音频和图像之间的关系？**\n\n**0xDEAFBEEF：**视觉感知和听觉感知相互影响，使视听成为一种独特的媒介，不同于单独的音乐或动画。同步中的微小差异，会导致感知上的巨大差异。抽象的声音和图像可以有力地传达一种情绪或感觉，提供与单独的组件完全不同的体验。实验电影制作人很清楚这一点。例如，导演大卫·林奇（David Lynch）在他所拍摄的所有电影中亲自操刀声音设计，效果很好。声音可以完全改变视觉或文字叙述的背景。\n\n我相信视听作为其自身的媒介，是相对较新的。还有很多东西需要探索。这个视频已过时，但约翰·惠特尼 (John Whitney) 在 [这里](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP5Mj6ZvZJc&t=9m28s) 进行了评论。我也很高兴想看看这个领域如何发展，因为像人工智能这样的技术，使个人的非技术流艺术家和作曲家，能如何更容易探索紧密结合的声音和视觉美学。\n\n就我个人的体验而言，存在很多不同路径。有时首先追求视觉效果，然后是寻找互补的声音。有时是相反的。我经常会有一个对不同状态声音和视觉想法的目录，并尝试将它们组合起来，并让它们相互影响，直到某些东西显现出来。\n\n虽然我确实有计算机图形学和动画方面的背景，但为了简单起见，当我去年开始这个项目时，我打算把它集中在生成声音 / 音乐上。但是当我开始在 Instagram 上分享时，我很快意识到：要让人们注意到音频，还必须有视觉元素。在视觉主导的社交媒体中，声音很难被注意到。人们可以滚动浏览图像，但音乐需要驻足时间。多年前我曾与音乐家朋友感叹，不幸的是，「你不能在 Instagram 上发布一张概念专辑」。这是社交媒体影响艺术和艺术家的众多例子之一，总的来说，我觉得这很有趣。Beeple 的 Everydays 和 XCOPY 的动画 GIF 是其他示例。\n\n**Sam Spike： NFT 具有颠覆传统文化产业的巨大潜力，就像 DeFi 颠覆传统金融一样。另一个问题是：它们是否也会改变文化自身的形式，产生新的风格、流派和运动。在你看来，文化主要是由技术变革驱动吗？**\n\n**0xDEAFBEEF：**相对而言，我还是一个新人，但我在 2 月份第一次加入 Discord 频道时就很明显感知到，加密文化——NFT 作为其中一个子集——切实存在，我们目前正在见证它的继续发展，并产生上述所有的东西。", "timestamp": 1633793690, "digest": "Z63kViGpeRAKqqChfFRgmHnyuk_vXAtknzk5cLar8LE", "contributor": "0x6C1AAd76D48a575A62036e9Ce2dCFde5b556053E"}

{"id": "xz98THsjIKgg1dgthyvOo749I50hoiEkqhjpaXB-UPo", "title": "Notes", "body": "Mirror raised $10m at a $100m valuation from a16z and USV in June 2021 with no users. Up until a few days ago, it was in closed beta; only open to those who were either hand selected or voted in by a community of Mirror writers growing by 10 writers a week. 33 weeks and 330 new contributors later, Mirror has now opened two of its features to the public - Crowdfunds and Entries. \n\nThe key difference between Mirror and Medium / Substack is that the data is stored on decentralized servers (Arweave). This means the writer controls the data, not the platform. If you want to leave Medium, you have to copy paste every article you’ve ever written. If there’s a better Mirror - you can take your Mirror data to it and have a new UI/UX based on your data. The shift from client-server to client-blockchain brings  censorship-resistance and anonymous economic collaboration to the internet. This is a huge breakthrough for humankind as it allows for the coordination of resources between those who are not corrupted by special interests and who want to fight for \n\nCommoditizing music with spotify\n\nOr we are unlocked music via NFTs\n\nWhen I first discovered Mirror I thought it was a fascinating exploration of the web 3.0 design space. With crowdfunds, NFTs, and cool features built into the user experience thanks to Ethereum’s general purpose programmability, Mirror could be the end game in online publishing, replacing Medium and Substack with a superior product suite, owned by its community of writers and readers, allowing both to share in wealth creation in unprecedented ways.\n\nCrowdfunding is what enables change. We can’t rely on governments to.\n\nI ilterally can’t\n\nAnonymous crowdfunding.\n\nWriting competitions?\n\nAs founder Graeme says, “Social forums like Mirror can use ownership verification to legitimize an account's voice within these communities, producing social capital for a pseudonymous avatar - without revealing the identity of the owner. This allows anonymous individuals to reliably coordinate, transact, and advance group values - an innovation in global collective action.\n\nFrom the first article I read, I was itching to write on the platform and try out some of the new features. That’s already a good sign. But Mirror kept me waiting. They did something smart, they only allowed a small number of contributors to initially write for the platform - rewarding them with a token called $WRITE that could be cast as a vote for the next 10 members on the platform. This approach maintained quality and stoked demand for access. The uses of $WRITE token by its community will be governed by its culture and value system which is still taking shape.\n\nThis is why it's been so important for Mirror to go slow with onboarding, and to try its best to diversify its membership. We've received some criticism for this, but ultimately this will enable true decentralized ownership. If we can accelerate membership over time while maintaining integrity, then we can create universal ownership drips that enable hard-to-fake, true decentralization.\n\nThe plot twist is that this is already happening, but nobody has noticed it yet. So, stay tuned.\n\nAs the platform grew I tried to access it and was forced to authenticate by tweeting a prepared message created by the Mirror team. I did this several times and was unable to access the Mirror platform. To be able to just connect freely with your metamask and start writing. This is the key.\n\nFinal note: Financial contributors and developers should be rewarded, too. But the distribution algorithm needs to keep this in check so that it can't be gamed, and that it's set up to allow for long-term rewards, and doesn't just enrich the early contributors. We want to make a new and better world through decentralized ownership, and that means we have to steer clear of the old patterns where early contributors and adopters get too much.”\n\nMirror is open-source. Meaning that different communities can have different.\n\nHow do you really know that other platforms aren’t recording everything you write and a backdoor for government surveillance? People can really come together with this technology and share. It’s the most important platform ever created. A truly censorship resistant marketplace of ideas. The digital printing press of the 21st century.\n\nI think using crowdfunds and NFTs to promote certain behaviors within a publisher’s community will create some of the most productive redistributions of wealth in history. I don’t know what those applications / behaviors are yet but they are coming and they will be financially irresistible to Medium and Substack influencers.\n\nI’ve been studying tokenomics and it seems somewhat untenable. Due to US securities regulations, projects are being forced to withhold incredible wealth from their US users. You need to indemnify U.S. citizens from blocking access to the dy/dx airdrop. There’s a ton of people in the U.S. who missed out on the token. That’s how hard you have to bet on the market.\n\nYour most precious resource is time. That’s why I want to help you navigate the world of crypto opportunities.\n\na freer market for ideas and crushed the church.\n\nMirror is the most free market for ideas and is censorship resistant.\n\nI would buy $Write Tokens. The demand for ownership in this asset class is based on VCs who are locking value in certain projects. It’s hard to really trust the valuations because rugs happen. Anything can be rugged.\n\nCore values - before you let companies sponsor you\n\nI like that", "timestamp": 1633793239, "digest": "CIpjhlcCOyW2tnzWQHIwFVaSxrItStxFpb-IQTGjDCg", "contributor": "0x7b769566882Df5c3B7f2c7985ff3B328c17418F4"}

La naturaleza es democrática en la forma que distribuye la inteligencia y no suele ocurrir, salvo geniales excepciones, que el intelecto de un ser humano esté muy por encima o por debajo de otro y ello es así incluso en el caso de los ministros de justicia.\n\n¿Por qué entonces existe este descontento generalizado por la gestión de, al menos, los últimos cinco ministros de justicia?\n\nLa pregunta es compleja pero, si hemos de buscar una respuesta única, esta no sería otra que la decidida voluntad de los partidos políticos de controlar la administración de justicia.\n\nEsta voluntad de control de la administración de justicia entra en siniestra sinergia con los intereses de algunas grandes corporaciones e incluso con la de algunos grandes bufetes, pero, quizá, mejor que describirlo de forma abstracta, es ilustrarlo con un ejemplo reciente.\n\nHasta ahora, las restricciones de derechos que, con motivo de la pandemia, adoptaban los poderes ejecutivos, eran controladas por simples jueces. Recordarán ustedes que las decisiones de estos jueces no siempre han corrido parejas con las intenciones de los poderes ejecutivos y que, en algunos casos, estos vieron como algunos jueces frenaban la validez de sus decisiones.\n\nEl criterio de estos jueces puede ser criticable o plausible —según el pensamiento de cada cual— más, de lo que no puede dudarse, es de que el criterio de estos jueces era absolutamente independiente.\n\nEl poder, molesto con estas decisiones, ha decidido tomar cartas en el asunto y, la principal que ha tomado, es la que mejor ilustra la forma en que los ejecutivos tratan de influir en el sentido de las decisiones de los jueces: [ha decidido trasladar la competencia para tomar este tipo de decisiones de los juzgados a los Tribunales Superiores de Justicia.](https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2020-09-01/gobierno-jueces-base-coronavirus_2732691/)\n\n¿Cómo afecta esto a las decisiones judiciales?\n\nTrataré de explicarme.\n\nLos jueces, guste o no, son elegidos a través de un proceso donde el criterio político no tiene influencia alguna. La forma de acceso a la carrera judicial es memorizar para luego exponer una serie de contenidos, de forma que es la calidad reproductora del aspirante la que determina si este accederá o no a la carrera. Esta forma de acceso puede ser alabada, criticada, denostada e incluso satirizada, pero lo que nunca se podrá decir de ella es que está sesgada por ningún criterio político.\n\nPor el contrario, la forma de selección de los presidentes de los Tribunales Superiores de Justicia (TSJ) no funciona igual: en su nombramiento es decisiva la intervención del Consejo General del Poder Judicial (CGPJ) un órgano que, como todos ustedes saben, se compone de miembros designados por los partidos polítivos tras intensas negociaciones pastelarias. Si quiere saber cuán importante es para los partidos la identidad de quienes componen este órgano tan solo piense usted en cuán intensas son las negociaciones para nombrarlos y esto le aclarará, mejor que ninguna palabra mía, lo importante que es para los partidos contar con personalidades afines en este órgano.\n\nLa diferencia, pues, entre que un asunto lo decida un juez o lo decida un TSJ es que, en el primer caso, el juez dictará la resolución que entienda procedente con arreglo a su único y exclusivo criterio. En el segundo caso no diré que la decisión sea sesgada, sólo diré que, el presidente del órgano que decide, no ha sido nombrado en virtud de un procedimiento exclusivamente basado en los principios del mérito y la capacidad, sino que ha sido sesgado por criterios que parecen mucho menos nobles.\n\nEsta es la forma en que el poder político trata de infiltrarse y controlar la administración de justicia y este es el plan que Partido Popular y Partido Socialista diseñaron y explicitaron en el siglo XX en su libro negro de la justicia. Su idea es que, en lugar de jueces que hacen lo que les da la gana, haya «Tribunales de Instancia», cada uno con su presidente debidamente elegido, que se comporten de forma más «ordenada» a juicio del poder político, naturalmente.\n\nLos poderes políticos no pueden controlar a 5000 jueces que han accedido a su puesto compitiendo con fundamento en los principios de mérito y capacidad y es por eso que, desde el siglo pasado, tratan de someterlos a una disciplina fundada en una jerarquía como la que les he contado que pudiera existir en los TSJ. El poder político busca establecer el momio de los tribunales de instancia no por eficacia (absolutamente nula) sino porque es la forma más eficaz de controlar a esa caterva de jueces díscolos que tienen la mala costumbre de fallar los procesos según su independiente criterio.\n\nPara poder establecer los tribunales de instancia es fundamental reducir el número de partidos judiciales al mínimo posible aunque ello signifique alejar la administración de justicia de los ciudadanos. Esa reducción buscada por los partidos firmantes del libro negro conviene a las grandes corporaciones (dificulta el acceso de los consumidores a los juzgados), conviene a los grandes despachos (sólo necesitan 52 sucursales y no 433) pero, sobre todo a quien conviene, es a los partidos autores del actual estado de cosas.\n\nEs por eso que el ministro Caamaño trató de reducir los partidos judiciales y es por eso que Gallardón trató de que sólo hubiese juzgados en las capitales de provincia; Catalá “especializó” los juzgados hipotecarios y los llevó a las capitales de provincia y ahora Campo vende su “oficina de justicia” en lugares como Lerma, que, curiosamente, tiene juzgado. Todo por allanar el camino de los tribunales de instancia, todo por mejor controlar la justicia.\n\nUnos trataron de hacerlo a las bravas (Gallardón) otros poco a poco (Caamaño, Catalá), otros subrepticiamente (Campo), pero, aunque sus formas hayan sido distintas, todos los titulares de la cartera de Justicia han sido en esencia fieles creyentes de la doctrina fijada por el necronomicón judicial pactado en el siglo pasado por Partido Popular y Partido Socialista.\n\nPor eso yo no afirmaría que todos los ministros de justicia han sido malos, inútiles o ineptos. Ciertamente y de cara al interés general su gestión ha sido nefasta pero es que no creo que el interés general haya sido su objetivo; creo más bien que su objetivo es el ánimo de controlar la administración de justicia que dio forma al libro negro de la justicia al que sirven.\n\nEs triste decirlo pero la realidad es que no existe en España consenso alguno en relación con lo que debería ser nuestra administración de justicia, lo único que existe es una voluntad política perpetua y constante de controlarla y es eso lo que irrita a quienes, poco a poco, van tomando conciencia de ello.", "timestamp": 1633794701, "digest": "hQI2nrF8LsZlECxdK3xtVdweWk4nHwGhWs717zMlm7o", "contributor": "0xb5bF77b790f8185a6968F0B26f7Ff2610c1aAe42"}

Los LAJ, a diferencia de los jueces y magistrados, no son, en modo alguno, esas personas independientes, inamovibles, responsables y sometidos únicamente al imperio de la ley que dice el artículo 117.1 de la Constitución. Tampoco gozan de esos privilegios de no poder ser separados, suspendidos, trasladados… con que el número 2 del artículo citado protege a los encargados de juzgar y ejecutar lo juzgado.\n\nLa cadena de mando, desde el Ministro al último LAJ, está férreamente establecida en las leyes y es por eso por lo que estos están obligados a cumplir los protocolos, instrucciones u órdenes que se les impartan[4](#4). Dicho de otro modo, aquellos que van a encargarse de la mayoría de los aspectos procesales del proceso están sometidos al principio de jerarquía respecto de un poder distinto del Poder Judicial. En España la mayoría de las resoluciones procesales las toman unos funcionarios ajenos al Poder Judicial y jerárquicamente dependientes del Poder Ejecutivo.\n\nCreo que, con entender esto, ya podrán saber ustedes cuáles son las intenciones de este ministro y de los anteriores y por qué han puesto tanto empeño en forzar la implantación de la nueva oficina judicial.\n\nY ahora esbocemos algún posible ejemplo de para qué le sirve o le podría servir al Poder Ejecutivo tener a sus órdenes a los funcionarios que ejercen el papel de “jueces de lo procesal”.\n\nPor ejemplo, a la hora de fijar la cuantía de un procedimiento de nulidad de cláusulas hipotecarias, mediante las convenientes reformas, los LAJ podrían recibir instrucciones para fijarla como de cuantía indeterminada (18.000€) o, alternativamente, podrían reducir la cuantía en exclusiva a las cantidades líquidas reclamadas por gastos… (apenas 1000 o 2000€) ¿te suena? ¿te lo imaginas o crees que lo has vivido ya?. Si el gobierno quisiera hacerle un favor a la banca ¿Saben cuantos millones de euros les ahorraría una decisión como esta?\n\nEs verdad que el intento del ejecutivo de que algunas decisiones de los LAJ no pudieran ser revisadas por los jueces fue declarada nula en 2016 por el Tribunal Constitucional[5](#5), pero, salvado este monumental atentado a la independencia judicial e incluso en el caso de que todas sus resoluciones puedan ser revisadas por los jueces (siempre a instancia de parte), divorciar a estos últimos de la ordenación del procedimiento es poner injustamente en manos de los sucesivos gobiernos (*rectius* de de los partidos que los ocupan) un poder inmenso.\n\nEscindir lo procesal de lo sustantivo es una aberración jurídica pero, créanme, no hay aberración que no sean capaces de llevar a cabo los partidos políticos que ocupan los sillones del poder.\n\nTengan la seguridad de que si el poder judicial cae en sus manos —y falta muy poco para que esto suceda— el Estado de Derecho dejará de existir en España para siempre.\n\n\\---\n\n1\\.De la Oliva Santos, A.

Por si a alguien le queda alguna duda sobre de quién dependen los Letrados de la Administración de Justicia es bueno que lean el siniestro artículo 463.1 LOPJ cuya dicción no deja lugar a dudas: “Bajo la superior dependencia del Ministerio de Justicia el Cuerpo de Letrados de la Administración de Justicia se ordena jerárquicamente en la forma que se determine en las relaciones de puestos de trabajo.

En el caso de la NOJ el truco era escindir los aspectos procesales y sustantivos del proceso y poner los primeros en manos de los LAJ pero —y ahí está la trampa— sin dotar a estos funcionarios ni de la independencia ni de ninguna de las garantías que la constitución atribuye a los jueces.\n\nCon la entrega de la instrucción de las causas a la fiscalía ocurre otro tanto: el gobierno aparta de esos molestos jueces (independientes, inamovibles, sometidos solo a la ley…) la instrucción de las causas para entregárselas a los fiscales, funcionarios que NO están adornados de la independencia de los jueces y que, como el propio presidente del gobierno puso de manifiesto con toda claridad, están sometidos al principio de jerarquía.\n\nLo que no han logrado ni con la NOJ, ni con los tribunales de instancia, ni con todas las malas artes que les he descrito en los tres post anteriores, pretenden ahora lograrlo entregando la instrucción a la fiscalía pero sin dotarla ni de independencia y sin liberarla de ese principio de jerarquía que la sujeta.\n\nLa fiscalía además carece de medios y en el presupuesto no se contempla ninguno: ¿a quién favorece entonces esta aberración?\n\nPues les favorece a ellos, los políticos, y de entre ellos a los ya corruptos o los que están en trámite de corromperse. El juez de instrucción, ese tipo odioso que puede ordenar la detención de cualquier alcalde o concejal de urbanismo, es una figura insoportable para el político que se cree intocable. Mejor que ese juez capaz de pensar por sí mismo, piensan estos genares de quien les hablo, un fiscal bien sujetadito a una jerarquía que ya nos encargaremos nosotros de poner a punto.\n\nEn medio de la pandemia, con la justicia a mes y medio del caos, el ministro —a quien por lo que se ve [le importa un carajo que España se vaya al idem](https://josemuelas.org/2020/04/16/la-justicia-espanola-contribuira-decisivamente-a-que-nos-vayamos-todos-al-carajo/)— se dedica a proponer una tras otra las mismas medidas que ya trató de imponer Caamaño, Gallardón y Catalá, para mejor controlar al único poder capaz de frenar la desvergüenza de esta caspa castosa.\n\nY, lo que más me perturba, créanme, es que, si los españoles y españolas no toman conciencia de ello y lo impiden, esta banda acabará saliéndose con la suya y acabando con todas las esperanzas de vivir en una sociedad digna.\n\n<!-- .entry-content -->\n\n<!-- .entry-footer -->\n\n<!-- #post-## -->\n\n<!-- #comments -->\n\n<!-- #main -->\n", "timestamp": 1633795180, "digest": "EkfUWxg_YeQtZa60VN-i14XW6GXZa5pqkn1epA2TdIc", "contributor": "0xb5bF77b790f8185a6968F0B26f7Ff2610c1aAe42"}

Dado que la *Nueva *Oficina Judicial lleva muchos años en funcionamiento en partidos judiciales como Burgos o Murcia se me ocurrió que sería bueno comprobar con datos si esas *Nuevas* Oficinas Judiciales habían supuesto algún tipo de mejora para el funcionamiento de dichos partidos judiciales y, tras un análisis de tablas y datos, el resultado no ha podido ser más demoledor: NO, absolutamente NO, lo que dice el ministro de justicia de la *Nueva* Oficina Judicial no es más que un ridículo camelo, una mentira consciente, para forzar [un modelo de justicia conveniente a los partidos](https://josemuelas.org/2020/11/15/como-acabar-de-una-vez-por-todas-con-la-independencia-judicial-i-la-noj/) que se han instalado en el gobierno de nuestro país.\n\nSin embargo, mientras comprobaba los datos de los diversos partidos judiciales, se me ha ocurrido que, seguramente, sería bueno referir los datos de cada juzgado al número de asuntos resueltos, pendientes, etc. que se llevaban en cada Partido Judicial pues la cifra resultante, sin ser exacta respecto del funcionamiento de cada juzgado en concreto, sí que nos daría una idea muy aproximada del rendimiento medio de los funcionarios de cada partido judicial y compararlo, por ejemplo, con los funcionarios que atienden las NOJ ya existentes. Un buen sistema organizativo, he pensado, debe hacer rendir más a los funcionarios y, con menos de ellos, se podrá hacer más; así que me he aplicado a la tarea y toda una serie interminable de tópicos y estereotipos han empezado a venirse abajo hasta no quedar títere con cabeza.\n\nLo primero que he hecho es averiguar el número de asuntos resueltos el año 2019 en cada partido judicial y relacionarlo con el número de funcionarios que trabajan en él, el resultado, como verán en la tabla de abajo ha sido sorprendente:\n\n[![](https://webley.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/captura-de-pantalla-de-2020-11-21-18-47-20.png?w=907)](https://webley.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/captura-de-pantalla-de-2020-11-21-18-47-20.png)\n\nLos diez primeros partidos judiciales ordenados según la productividad de sus funcionarios son TODOS andaluces; es decir, el tópico del andaluz holgazán ya pueden ir ustedes guardándolo: en la administración de justicia española los funcionarios más productivos son los andaluces y no los de grandes juzgados o los que han recibido la inversión de la NOJ, no; en los juzgados donde más trabajo se saca adelante es en los juzgados pequeños: entre los 10 primeros partidos judiciales de la lista por productividad de sus funcionarios sólo dos superan los cien mil habitantes y sólo uno (Vélez Málaga) ha recibido el refuerzo de la NOJ.\n\nSi el primer tópico que podía usted arrojar a la basura era el de “andaluces holgazanes”, ahora puede ir usted arrojando a la basura igualmente dos más muy queridos al ministro: que “los partidos judiciales pequeños no son eficaces” o que “los funcionarios rinden más con la NOJ”.\n\nNaturalmente varios abogados, al ver lugares como Montoro o San Fernando en los primeros lugares de la lista por productividad de sus funcionarios, me han llamado para decirme:* no puede ser, los juzgados de Montoro o San Fernando están absolutamente colapsados*.\n\nNaturalmente he decidido comprobarlo y he vuelto a referir el número de asuntos en trámite a las plantillas de funcionarios existentes en cada partido judicial para ver la tasa de atasco analizada desde el punto de vista del número de funcionarios. La tabla ha quedado como sigue:\n\n[![](https://webley.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/captura-de-pantalla-de-2020-11-21-18-57-16.png?w=897)](https://webley.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/captura-de-pantalla-de-2020-11-21-18-57-16.png)\n\nComo ven todavía bastantes juzgados andaluces arriba pero, sobre todo, lo sorprendente es que partidos judiciales cuyos funcionarios sabemos que son de una productividad extraordinaria (Montoro, San Fernando…) tienen, al mismo tiempo las mayores tasas de asuntos pendientes. Ante este fenómeno sólo hay una explicación posible: en Montoro o San Fernando los funcionarios trabajan como máquinas aunque, desafortunadamente, la carga de trabajo está muy por encima de sus posibilidades; es decir: faltan medios.\n\nLa percepción general, pues, de que los juzgados funcionan mal es correcta; lo que no es correcto es que sea a causa de la incuria de sus funcionarios. Como en todas partes hay funcionarios buenos y malos pero, el problema de la justicia española no está en que tengamos malos funcionarios, el problema es que tenemos malos dirigentes que son incapaces de mirar datos y prefieren conocer España por puros tópicos. Caso paradigmático es el actual ministro.\n\nComo pueden ver en la primera de las tablas (la que relaciona el número de casos resueltos con el número de funcionarios) sólo aparece una NOJ (Vélez Málaga) y no en los primeros puestos; si miramos los últimos lugares veremos que es allí donde se acumulan las NOJ (ese sitema organizativo tan *cojonudo* que logra que los juzgados funcionen peor a costa de un cuantiosa inversión de dinero). La cosa, como ven, manda huebos (sí, con “b”).\n\nComo no quiero herir orgullos identitarios no les pondré los últimos lugares de la tabla de productividad no sea que comunidades tradicionalmente catalogadas como eficientes se me enfaden y, por eso, pondré el ejemplo de mi propia Comunidad Autónoma: la Región de Murcia.\n\nAquí está la tabla\n\n[![](https://webley.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/captura-de-pantalla-de-2020-11-21-19-24-05.png?w=1024)](https://webley.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/captura-de-pantalla-de-2020-11-21-19-24-05.png)\n\nComo ven, los funcionarios de los juzgados de Cartagena son los campeones de esta liga en dura pugna con los de Lorca, Molina y Totana. Murcia, ultradotada y con funcionarios magníficos queda en último lugar. Si no le gustan los datos les dejo la fuente de donde están tomados (el CGPJ) pueden comprobarlos.\n\nMiren, yo no creo que por trabajar en Murcia o Molina un funcionario trabaje más o menos, lo que sí le puedo decir es que allá donde esta la NOJ no se observa (siendo piadoso) ningún resultado que haga pensar que sea una solución a los problemas de nuestra justicia y sí [una forma de coartar la independencia de los jueces](https://josemuelas.org/2020/11/15/como-acabar-de-una-vez-por-todas-con-la-independencia-judicial-i-la-noj/).\n\nPero, ya que estoy con la Región de Murcia, no deseo quedarme a medias: vamos a revisar la tasa de atasco por funcionario que esta presenta. Veámos la tabla.\n\n[![](https://webley.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/captura-de-pantalla-de-2020-11-21-19-30-31.png?w=1024)](https://webley.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/captura-de-pantalla-de-2020-11-21-19-30-31.png)\n\nComo ven, partidos judiciales con funcionarios acreditadamente productivos (Molina y Totana) ven que su trabajo no sirve de nada y el atasco aumenta porque los recursos que debieran destinarse a ellos se destinan a una NOJ que, probadamente, no funciona y dilapida la capacidad e trabajo de los funcionarios de nuestra región. Si es usted funcionario en Molina de Segura o Totana se tiene usted ganado el cielo. Y luego hay idiotas unimunicipales que estiman que los partidos de Molina o Totana son inútiles. Necios.\n\nEn fin, entiéndaseme, no digo que los juzgados españoles funcionen bien (funcionan pésimamente) pero si hemos de buscar culpables con todas seguridad no deberíamos señalar ni a los funcionarios, ni a los partidos judiciales pequeños, ni a los juzgados unipersonales; más que probablemente deberíamos señalar a la estulticia de todos esos ministros que, desde 1997, están intentado sustituir un sistema que necesita medios por otro peor (la NOJ) tan sólo para poder controlar mejor la justicia.\n\nY en esta legislatura el ministro sigue en ello.\n\nNecios.\n", "timestamp": 1633795240, "digest": "2L4FmX2iIi8_ihUmsWxc6xL9HXvkEWfSRejcwe0Elpk", "contributor": "0xb5bF77b790f8185a6968F0B26f7Ff2610c1aAe42"}

Lo que fotografié habla por sí mismo “res ipsa loquitur” y, si me lo permiten, quisiera compartirlo con ustedes.\n\nAntes que nada y, para que se vayan situando, déjenme mostrarles un plano general del interior de la Ciudad de la Justicia de Valencia.\n\n[![Vista general del interior de la Ciudad de la Justicia de Valencia](https://josemuelas.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img00074-20101028-1014.jpg?w=300\\&h=225 \"IMG00074-20101028-1014\")](http://josemuelas.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img00074-20101028-1014.jpg)\n\nVista general del interior de la Ciudad de la Justicia de Valencia\n\nAparentemente impresionante ¿verdad?. Sin embargo, no se dejen engañar por el especto exterior, el diablo se esconde en los detalles. Veámoslo.\n\n### 1. La oficina sin papeles.\n\nLo primero que llama la atención al acercarse a cualquiera de los innumerables juzgados que componen el ominoso edficio del que hablamos, es la omnipresencia de archivadores tirados y/o amontonados por todas partes. Los archivadores se acumulan apilados contra las paredes de las pequeñas salas de vistas de los Juzgados de lo Civil o lo Mercantil, los archivadores invaden también las salas de trabajo de los funcionarios y, en general, uno no acaba de explicarse a qué se debe esa proliferación de archivadores por todas partes. Vean una foto a título ilustrativo y créanme que es una de las menos impactantes pues no pude tomar fotos en la Sala de Vistas.\n\n[![Archivadores](https://josemuelas.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img00069-20101028-0920.jpg?w=300\\&h=225 \"Archivadores\")](http://josemuelas.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img00069-20101028-0920.jpg)\n\nLos archivadores forran las paredes de las dependencias judiciales\n\nSorprendido por la proliferación de archivadores pregunté a los funcionarios si es que no disponían de mobiliario de archivo y la respuesta que me dieron fue que, a las cabezas pensantes que diseñaron la Ciudad de la Justicia, se les olvidó o no le dieron importancia a las cuestiones del archivo, quizá soñando con una futura oficina sin papeles donde el expediente electrónico subsituyese al texto escrito.\n\nEsta falta de previsión de arquitectos y diseñadores, sin embargo, ha dado lugar al nacimiento de una nueva forma de expresión artística que no dudo en bautizar como el “Nuevo Interiorismo Judicial Valenciano” (NIJ-V) y que, a semejanza de la [Bauhaus](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escuela_de_la_Bauhaus \"Bauhaus\"), estoy seguro que va a revolucionar el diseño y decoración de interiores en las próximas centurias, dando lugar incluso a nuevas oportunidades de trabajo para los funcionarios de la Ciudad de la Justicia de Valencia, auténticos creadores de esta nueva expresión del ingenio humano.\n\n### 2. El “Nuevo Interiorismo Judicial”: Mobiliario.\n\nEl nuevo interiorismo judicial se caracteriza en la Ciudad de la Justicia de Valencia por diversas notas entre las cuales podemos citar, sin ánimo de ser exhaustivos:\n\n1.  El uso masivo de materiales aparentemente sin valor para construir muebles de alta funcionalidad. El cartón, la grapa y la cinta de embalar ocupan lugares señeros.\n2.  El diseño sigue a la función de forma incluso más férrea que en la [Bauhaus](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escuela_de_la_Bauhaus \"Bauhaus\") lo que confiere al conjunto una indudable profundidad ideológica.\n3.  Gracias al empleo masivo de materiales reciclados el costo del mobiliario es insignificante y, por contra, se protege el medio ambiente.\n4.  La combustibilidad del conjunto del mobiliario así creado es magnífica, en sintonía con el origen levantino-fallero del mismo, aspecto este que no debe ser olvidado.\n\nEnunciados los caracteres básicos del “Nuevo Interiorismo Judicial Valenciano” (NIJ-V) permítanme que les presente algunas de sus creaciones más difundidas, muebles que no faltan en ninguna dependencia de la Ciudad de la Justicia de Valencia y que son tan consustanciales a ella como el arroz a la paella.\n\nVeamos en primer lugar la llamada **“Mesa de Despacho NOJ”**, que presenta diversas variantes según las dependencias pero que, en su forma básica, presenta este diseño:\n\n[![Mesa de despacho NOJ](https://josemuelas.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img00071-20101028-10011.jpg?w=300\\&h=225 \"Mesa de despacho NOJ\")](http://josemuelas.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img00071-20101028-10011.jpg)\n\nMesa de despacho NOJ\n\nEl mueble está confeccionado en exclusiva con materiales reciclados y que se encuentran fácilmente en cualquier oficina judicial: Archivadores viejos, cinta de embalar y grapas. A pesar de la aparente fragilidad de sus componentes, el conjunto es de una solidez notable, soportando con facilidad grandes pesos e incluso, cuando la ocasión lo requiere, puede recombinarse con muebles similares dando lugar a mesas de despacho… de juntas… etc. El límite sólo lo pone tu imaginación.\n\nLa gama de colores sólo está limitada por las tonalidades de cartón disponible pero, en general, en los diseños del “Nuevo Interiorismo Judicial Valenciano” predominan el blanco y el marrón. El predominio de estos colores se deriva de la forma en que el funcionario-diseñador utilice  los archivadores viejos que, aunque por el lado de fuera son blancos, si se les da la vuelta nos ofrecen un interesante color marron-gris-verduzco-sucio que, usado sabiamente, dota de contraste y fuerza visual a las creaciones de estos funcionarios-diseñadores.\n\nEs importante resaltar que la finalidad primordial del mueble que se ve en la foto no es servir de mesa, sino de archivador de expedientes, lo que no reduce en modo alguno su funcionalidad como mesa, repisa, leja o velador. Dado que IKEA aún no se ha asentado en la Comunidad Valenciana estoy realizando activas negociaciones con el centro de Murcia para venderles el producto.\n\nEl catálogo de muebles es amplísimo y no se limita sólamente al módulo “mesa de despacho NOJ”, con sus incontables combinaciones, visto hasta ahora. Las soluciones archivísticas generadas por el “Nuevo Interiorismo Judicial Valenciano” alcanzan cotas difíciles de igualar cuando, en hábil aprovechamiento de espacios, dan lugar a muebles de los denominados “colgantes” o “en voladizo”.\n\nDentro de este tipo de muebles es muy popular en la Ciudad de la Justicia de Valencia la llamada **“Estantería NOJ Suspendida” **que, en su versión más popular, presenta el aspecto que se observa en la siguiente fotografía:\n\n[![Estantería NOJ Suspendida](https://josemuelas.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img00072-20101028-10021.jpg?w=300\\&h=225 \"Estantería NOJ Suspendida\")](http://josemuelas.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img00072-20101028-10021.jpg)\n\nEstantería NOJ Suspendida\n\nAunque la acumulación de archivos a su alrededor no permite contemplar el mueble de la fotografía en todo su esplendor, puedo asegurarles que la estantería que ven se encuentra suspendida de la pared merced a la sabia utilización de la cinta de embalar por parte de los funcionarios. Los materiales de que está compuesta la “Estantería NOJ Suspendida” son, como en el caso de la “Mesa de despacho NOJ”, cartones provenientes de archivadores viejos, grapas, y cinta de embalar para dar consistencia al conjunto. La gama de colores es similar a la antes descrita para la “Mesa de despacho NOJ”.\n\nLas razones por las que la “Estantería NOJ Suspendida” acapara la atención de los diseñadores más relevantes del mundo pueden resumirse en las tres siguientes:\n\n1.  Al hallarse suspendida la estantería, la posibilidad de que el conjunto se desplome lateralmente sobre algún funcionario es mínima, lo que, aunque esto importe poco en la Administración de Justicia,  permite a la “Estantería NOJ Suspendida” ser utilizada en empresas del sector privado que han de cumplir con la exigente normativa de seguridad e higiene en el trabajo.\n2.  Al encontrarse su centro de gravedad por debajo de su punto principal de sustentación, la “estantería NOJ suspendida” es un conjunto flexible, susceptible de recibir empujones o choques ocasionales sin desmoronarse ni deshacerse.\n3.  Cumpliendo con las necesarias medidas de seguridad y estando fabricada con materiales que se encuentran en cualquier oficina, vertedero o muladar, la “Estantería NOJ suspendida” puede dar lugar a la aparición de una nueva forma de funcionariado-chabolístico quer permita a la Administración a base de cartones, maderas y quizá (sólo quizá) uralitas asbestósicas, construir doficinas y organismos administrativos a bajo coste. Las revolucionarias consecuencias que esto puede tener a largo plazo son objeto de estudio aún por los mas acreditados politólogos.\n\nEl “Nuevo Interiorismo Judicial Valenciano” es además creador de un nuevo concepto en el interiorismo y en el diseño de mobiliario; este concepto, desconocido hasta ahora, es el del “anti-mueble”. Como explica la moderna física a cada partícula de materia le corresponde su inevitable partícula de anti-materia. Cercana como está la “Ciudad de la Justicia” a la “Ciudad de las Artes y las Ciencias” no es de extrañar que exista entre ambas una interacción que ha dado lugar a la quizá más futurista creación de la escuela del “Nuevo Interiorismo Judicial Valenciano”: El “Anti-Tablón de Anuncios”.\n\nDetectada por los funcionarios-diseñadores del “Nuevo Interiorismo Judicial Valenciano” la ausencia de tablones de anuncios en el edificio de la Ciudad de la Justicia, resolvieron dicha carencia de la forma más ingeniosa y revolucionaria que imaginarse puede: diseñaron “Anti-Tablones de Anuncios”. Observen el prodigioso resultado:\n\n[![El Anti-Tablón de Anuncios](https://josemuelas.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img00064-20101028-09161.jpg?w=300\\&h=225 \"Tablon de anuncios\")](http://josemuelas.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img00064-20101028-09161.jpg)\n\nEl Anti-Tablón de Anuncios\n\nComo ven, aparentemente, los anuncios no están colgados en tablón alguno sino sobre la propia pared… ¡¡error!! Ese es precisamente el efecto visual que genera el “Anti-Tablón”, la sugerencia aparente de inexistencia de tablón. La finura de las líneas y la levedad de su diseño nos llevan necesariamente a afirmar que con el Anti-Tablón las bellas artes han entrado por fín en el Siglo XXI.\n\nPara finalizar debemos decir que la gama de muebles creados por los funcionarios-diseñadores adscritos al “Nuevo Interiorismo Judicial Valenciano” es inmensa aunque, muy a nuestro pesar, deberemos abandonar por ahora esta interesante faceta para centrarnos en otros aspectos arquitectónico-procedimentales de la “Ciudad de la Justicia de Valencia”.\n\n### 3. El “Nuevo Interiorismo Judicial” y los flujos de trabajo: El llamado “cuello de botella”.\n\nEl “Nuevo Interiorismo Judicial Valenciano”, a pesar de las vertientes creativas vistas hasta ahora, no olvida que en la Administración de Justicia no sólo existen funcionarios, sino que en ella también están presentes los ciudadanos con su inevitable acompañamiento de abogados y procuradores. Para solventar los problemas que la presencia de ciudadanos, procuradores y abogados generan en la Administración de Justicia, el “Nuevo Interiorismo Judicial Valenciano” ha ideado un ingenioso mecanismo que, quizá acertadamente, algunos han denominado “cuello de botella”.\n\nEl mecanismo del “cuello de botella” responde a tres características esenciales:\n\n1.  La relación del funcionario con el ciudadano, su abogado o su procurador, debe ser restringida al mínimo; trantando por todos los medios que el contacto o no se produzca o, si se produce, que se lleve a efecto en las peores condiciones para el administrado.\n2.  El mecanismo de “cuello de botella” debe ser implementado con el mínimo coste posible y, a ser posible, usando los materiales propios del estilo de la “Nueva Oficina Judicial Valenciana”.\n3.  El mecanismo de “cuello de botella” debe, igualmente, prestarse en condiciones que induzcan al ciudadano al desasosiego a la confusión o a ambas cosas a la vez.\n4.  El mecanismo de “cuello de botella” debe, finalmente, disponer de una funcionalidad rápida y sencilla de usar que permita al funcionario convertir el mecanismo de “cuello de botella” en otro denominado “Tapón Administrativo Generalizado”.\n\nVeamos con cuánto ingenio ha sido implementado este “mecanismo de cuello de botella” en la Ciudad de la Justicia de Valencia, si bien, necesariamente, hemos de advertir que la paternidad del mecanismo no corresponde en exclusiva a los funcionarios-diseñadores del NIJ-V, sino que en este caso han contado con la indispensable colaboración de las cabezas pensantes (arquitectos, ingenieros, políticos, altos funcionarios) que diseñaron el interior de la Ciudad de la Justicia de Valencia.\n\nAntes de seguir adelante permítanme que les enseñe tan ingenioso dispositivo:\n\n[![El Cuello de Botella](https://josemuelas.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img00061-20101028-09151.jpg?w=300\\&h=225 \"El Cuello de Botella\")](http://josemuelas.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img00061-20101028-09151.jpg)\n\nEl mecanismo de Cuello de Botella (detalle)\n\nBásicamente el mecanismo del “cuello de botella”, como ven en la foto, consta de una tapadera de cartón que, a modo de expositor o display, exhibe adherido a ella una compleja combinación de números de procedimientos y números de teléfonos. Frente al expositor se ubica un teléfono y, para ilustrales sobre el uso del sistema, permítenme que les exponga un caso práctico.\n\nSupongamos que un ciudadano se acerca a la “Ciudad de la Justicia de Valencia” para interesarse por el estado de su procedimiento. Para ello se desplazará hasta el ominoso edificio, localizará con no pocas dificultades dónde está el Juzgado al que ha de ir y, cuando llegue a él, (planta 5ª zona roja, por ejemplo) se encontrará con que le resulta imposible hablar con ningún funcionario, ya que los funcionarios se encuentran recluídos en unas habitaciones absolutamente incomunicadas con la zona por donde deambulan los ciudadanos.\n\nEste logro de que los ciudadanos y los funcionarios vivan en ecosistemas estancos hay que atribuírselo, sin ningún género de dudas, a quienes diseñaron el edificio.\n\nLa estanqueidad entre las zonas de funcionarios y la zona de ciudadanos sólo está puesta en peligro por la existencia de un pequeño mostrador sobre el que se ubica el dispositivo de “cuello de botella” antes descrito. Véase la zona del mostrador a que nos referimos:\n\n[![Mostrador](https://josemuelas.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img00066-20101028-09171.jpg?w=300\\&h=224 \"Mostrador\")](http://josemuelas.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img00066-20101028-09171.jpg)\n\nUna ciudadana acercándose al \"mecanismo de cuello de botella\" sin percatarse del peligro\n\nLlegados a esta situación veamos cómo opera el “mecanismo de cuello de botella” y las inmensas posibilidades que ofrece.\n\nSituado el ciudadano frente al mostrador lo primero que observará es que no hay nadie tras él por lo que, en la generalidad de los casos, antes de llevar a cabo ninguna acción concreta esperará unos cuantos minutos a ver si aparece alguien.\n\nUna vez convencido el ciudadano de que allí no va a aparecer nadie y dependiendo de múltiples factores optará por dar unas voces, golpear el mostrador, silbar introduciéndose dos dedos en la comisura de los labios o, en casos tan escasos como llamativos, dar dos sonoras palmadas tratando de atraer la atención de algún funcionario.\n\nTodas estas acciones son inútiles, nadie aparece. El inocente ciudadano ignora que el  funcionario de la NIJ-V está perfectamente preparado para no darse por aludido por sonidos provenientes del ecosistema contiguo. El ciudadano, más o menos a estas alturas del proceso, repara en el expositor que hay sobre el mostrador y comienza a leerlo por si en él se contuviera alguna información relevante y es aquí donde, verdaderamente,  el “mecanismo de cuello de botella” despliega todas las funcionalidades que le han dado fama mundial.\n\nPorque el expositor (hecho con material reciclado, naturalmente) le indica al ciudadano que, dependiendo del número en que acabe el expediente por el que va a preguntar, debe marcar un número de teléfono que, a su vez, le pondrá en contacto con el funcionario que se ocupa del mismo. ¡¡Admirable!!\n\nAquí el fujo del trabajo diverge, pues puede ocurrir que el ciudadano no sepa cual es el número de su expediente (ya sea porque aún no tiene al no estar incoado o por otras causas) o puede ocurrir que sí lo sepa.\n\nEn caso de que lo sepa sólo tendrá que marcar el número correspondiente a su expediente en el teléfono que hay al lado del expositor y entonces…. entonces… bueno, ejem, entonces vuelve a diverger el flujo porque puede ocurrir que el funcionario que tramita su asunto no esté (porque está desayunando o porque está de baja) o que sí esté.\n\nEn este último caso, sólo cuando se han producido las anteriores condiciones (he encontrado el juzgado, espero, llamo, localizo el mecanismo, averiguo mi número de expediente, averiguo el número que le corresponde, lo marco, está el funcionario, le da la gana salir) aparecerá una persona que me preguntará qué es lo que quiero.\n\nEn cualquiera de los demás casos (no encuentro el juzgado, no localizo el mecanismo de “cuello de botella”, no sé mi número de procedimiento, no está mi funcionario, no quiere atenderme) la única solución es recurrir a la famosa receta, reina de la gastronomía cartagenera: [ajo y agua](http://www.wordreference.com/definicion/ajo).\n\nObsérvese que el “mecanismo de cuello de botella” aunque aparentemente simple, ofrece unas prestaciones impresionantes, así, por ejemplo, resumidamente:\n\n1.  Aunque los funcionarios del juzgado en cuestión sean muchos (por ejemplo 12), sólo atenderán las consultas de una en una, pues sólo hay un teléfono, por lo que se la posibilidad de que se acumule un número notable de personas esperando a ser atendidas es muy alta. Estas masas humanas esperando a ser atendidas son muy del gusto de las cabezas pensantes que diseñaron el edficio.\n2.  La imposibilidad de hablar con nadie si no conoces tu número de procedimiento elimina un buen número de consultas correspondientes a procedimientos no registrados o no incoados, estimulando de este modo el retraso.\n3.  La simpleza del mecanismo permite pasar de forma rápida del estado de “cuello de botella” al estado de “tapón judicial generalizado”.\n\nDurante mi presencia en la Ciudad de la Justicia de Valencia observé con regocijo cómo, de vez en cuando, algunos funcionarios retiraban el teléfono del mostrador, de forma que los sorprendidos ciudadanos no podían llamar a nadie y se limitaban a leer el expositor. Esta situación provocaba estados alterados de conciencia en los ciudadanos (unos leían el expositor de forma reiterada y miraban a su alrededor buscando el instrumento, otros deambulaban como sonámbulos por los pasillos buscando alguna otra conexión con el ecosistema funcionarial, muchos resolvían complicados asuntos genealógicos mediante soluciones escatológicas consistentes en acordarse de los muertos más frescos de alguien… en fin, todo lo que se puede desear  para la administración de Justicia. La Arcadia Feliz: La Ciudad de la Justicia de Valencia.\n\n### 4. El Humor Negro.\n\nEl “Nuevo Interiorismo Judicial Valenciano” no sería nada sin ciertas dosis de humor negro con que condimentar sus creaciones. A tal efecto la Administración ha hecho un importante esfuerzo económico en dotar al edificio de unas esculturas a tono con el “complejo” y que ilustran sobre el zeitgeist de la construcción. Veamos la primera de ellas, situada a la entrada del edficio en el llamado “hall”\n\n[![Escultura](https://josemuelas.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img00076-20101028-10201.jpg?w=300\\&h=225 \"Escultura\")](http://josemuelas.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img00076-20101028-10201.jpg)\n\nNo tenía yo bastantes cosas en la cabeza y...\n\nEsta cabeza de ciudadano rebosante de objetos incomprensibles que se le escapan del interior de la misma es una acertadísima representación del estado mental en que queda el honesto ciudadano valenciano a su salida de la Ciudad de la Justicia. Indudablemente, viendo la estatua, ya podemos concluir que nada de lo hasta aquí contado es casual: La escultura señala a todas luces que fue un designio doloso.\n\nIgualmente, ya a nuestra salida, podremos comprobar la verdadera visión y significado de una escultura que, a la entrada al edificio, parecían unas naranjas o frutas de color sorprendentemente blanco. No, error. El verdadero sentido de esa escultura sólo se comprende a la salida del edificio donde, desde la perspectiva adecuada, el monumento representa con toda claridad aquello que hay que tener para atreverse a entrar en este sito. He intitulado esta escultura genial: “Lo que hay que tener”, creo que es el nombre apropiado.\n\n[![Lo que hay que tener](https://josemuelas.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img00077-20101028-10211.jpg?w=300\\&h=225 \"huevos valencia\")](http://josemuelas.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img00077-20101028-10211.jpg)\n\nLo que hay que tener\n\nY no digo más.

{"id": "K9_jtpV1kyWFIbwSFm_TqayaHT4jD-SONChGMJkjn_U", "title": "De escribanos, secretarios judiciales y letrados de la administración de justicia", "body": "Conociendo el origen de las cosas se entiende mejor su estado presente y esto es válido tanto para los seres humanos como para las instituciones jurídicas; sin embargo, hoy, no quiero escribir ni de lo uno ni de lo otro, sino de la oficina judicial y de los letrados de la administración de justicia (LAJ) pues, en su historia reciente, pueden encontrarse las claves de alguno de los debates más insidiosos que aquejan a nuestra administración de justicia.\n\nSepan todos aquellos que la presente vieren y entendieren que la oficina judicial, desde finales del siglo XIX, se organizaba “casi” de forma mimética a una notaría actual; de hecho, notarios y escribanos (así se llamaban los secretarios judiciales) habían formado parte del mismo cuerpo muchos años.\n\nPues bien, al igual que el notario, ganada su plaza, contrata ahora a sus oficiales, costea los gastos de infraestructura de la notaría y cobra de los usuarios de sus servicios conforme a un arancel aprobado por el estado; al igual que el notario, digo, la infraestructura de los juzgados españoles se mantenía desde antiguo con lo que el escribano (ahora LAJ) cobraba de los administrados también en forma de arancel. Del mismo arancel cobraban los empleados de la oficina judicial, contratados por el mismo escribano, de forma que, dependiendo de la productividad de estos, la oficina judicial ingresaba más o menos dinero.\n\nEste panorama de juzgados arrendados y mantenidos de forma similar a como hoy se mantienen las notarías quizá te suene extraño, pero te aseguro que no está tan lejano en el tiempo.\n\nEsta división de funciones hizo que los jueces —funcionarios a sueldo del estado— fuesen, en comparación con los oficiales de su juzgado, unos pobretones dignos de pena. Es verdad que eran ellos a quienes correspondía la teórica gloria de impartir justicia pero, fuera de tan honorable detalle —hasta cierto punto teórico— en lo demás eran el elemento más digno de pena del juzgado. La situación era tal que, el 15 de junio de 1924, en la Revista de Derecho Privado escribe Beceña:\n\n> «…la situación de los jueces se agrava en términos de injusticia verdaderamente extrema e incomprensible, porque en los litigios intervienen, con función que no implica el trabajo ni la responsabilidad de la del juez, personas cuya retribución no solo es muy superior a la de aquel, y esto es ya una desigualdad injusta, sino notoriamente desproporcionada también con la función que cumplen dentro del litigio. Estos funcionarios son los secretarios judiciales que humildemente renuncian a todas las prerrogativas, honores y preeminencias de la carrera judicial; de paso renuncian también al trabajo y responsabilidad que esta lleva consigo, ya que son los que proporcionan a aquella toda su gloria y se contentan con unos aranceles muy fáciles de manejar, por su claridad, cuya aplicación se efectua con tal moderación y equidad, que da por resultado que Secretarios de Madrid, Barcelona y otras muchas capitales y Juzgados ganen mucho más, no sólo que los jueces a quienes auxilian, sino incluso más que las más altas representaciones de la Magistratura»\n\nIrónico pero implacable Beceña.\n\nLa «Ley provisional sobre Organización del Poder Judicial de 23 de junio de 1870», como toda ley «provisional» en España, fue la que dio carta de naturalezs a un sistema que se habría de prolongar más de un siglo.\n\nAunque, desde entonces, la supresión del arancel fue un objetivo largamente perseguido por los sucesivos gobiernos ningún cambio importante se produciría hasta 1947 en que los cuerpos de oficiales, auxiliares y agentes judiciales, fueron funcionarizados de manera que, todo el personal de la oficina judicial, pasó a cobrar teóricamente del estado.\n\nSin embargo, aunque se funcionarizó el personal de la oficina judicial y sus sueldos pasaron a depender del estado, NO se suprimió el arancel, de forma que los secretarios lo siguieron liquidando e ingresando y pagando con él no sólo las infraestructuras de la oficina sino también los gastos de los funcionarios en el desempeño de sus funciones. La oficina judicial, pues, era gobernada por el Secretario Judicial y el papel del juez en ella no pasaba de seguir siendo el de un triste secundario. Los juicios, mayoritariamente escritos, se realizaban sin la inmediación del juez y ni siquiera la del secretario pues, mayoritariamente, las actuaciones eran llevadas adelante por los demás funcionarios y requerir la presencia del secretario o el juez era considerado poco menos que como una desagradable extravagancia de la parte.\n\nEntre jueces y secretarios que no estaban, letrados que dejaban en manos del procurador la presentación de los pliegos de posiciones e interrogatorios y procuradores que delegaban tal función en sus oficiales habilitados, un juicio civil era una ceremonia que, a ojos de un abogado de hoy día, parecería una misa negra.\n\nEsta situación, por increíble que parezca, pervivió hasta la aprobación de la ley 1/1985, de 1 de julio, Orgánica del Poder Judicial, ley que proclamó el principio de gratuidad de la justicia. Cinco meses antes el llamado «Decreto del Autobús» (RD 210/85) había restringido las «indemnizaciones» que, con cargo al arancel, cobraban los funcionarios, erigiéndose el estado en único «indemnizador» de los funcionarios y sólo dentro de los económicos márgenes del transporte público.\n\nComo pueden imaginarse lo que hasta ese momento era una arcadia feliz —la oficina judicial— sufrió un cataclismo de proporciones bíblicas. La puntilla a todo este decimonónico sistema la dio la Ley 25/1986 de 24 de diciembre, que suprimió definitivamente las tasas judiciales consideradas entonces y con justicia como intolerables por todos los partidos de la Cámara, siendo el Sr. Ruíz Gallardón (padre de ese ministro de execrable recuerdo) uno de los valedores de esta eliminación.\n\nQuienes tengan años suficientes recordarán sin duda las llamadas «astillas» (Plaza «de la Astilla», se llamaba entonces a esa plaza donde se concentran bastantes juzgados en Madrid), es decir, aquellas exacciones ilegales que bajo la protección de la llamada «Ley de Mahoma» se producían en los juzgados; sin duda, conociendo los antecedentes de funcionamiento de la oficina judicial, esas astillas fueron el menor de los males esperables y la eficaz labor del estado —cuando todavía la justicia parecía importarle algo— finalmente acabó con ellas.\n\nEn todo este proceso de transformación de la oficina judicial, la figura del escribano-secretario judicial-letrado de la administración de justicia, como vemos, es capital; con los cambios experimentados con las últimas reformas citadas su papel quedó desdibujado lo cual, de la década de los 90 en adelante, trataría de ser aprovechado por los sucesivos gobiernos en una pugna que aún dura y es una de las claves para entender las estrategias de control de la administración de justicia por parte de determinados partidos.\n\nPero bueno, en este punto es recto que nos entramos en honduras y, de eso, ya hablaré otro día que tenga más tiempo y ganas.\n\nPD. Si te interesa este tema hay una obra cuya lectura te recomiendo encarecidamente; se trata del libro **«Justicia o burocracia»** del profesor **Marco de Benito Llopis-Llombart**, editada por Thompson-Reuters, Cuadernos Civitas, y que es, por otra parte, la base de este post.

Just by being early to Mirror I know that I will have a bright future. That’s all. I just have faith in Mirror. In looking in the mirror every day and really getting to know myself. Slowing down. I’m in a relationship. I honestly want to take some time and get to know myself again. I’m not sure I want to be in an exclusive relationship. Wow. The pain that comes up. I think Hannah is an incredible partner. I love her. I love us. But I also love life and need to understand myself better. I am definitely being slowed down. In a good way though. I don’t need to keep going. I need to just slow down. This is the first time. The working world is a certain speed. I’m not yet ready to press the gas in that way. \n\nI definitely need to figure out taxes. There’s a part of me that just wants to relive it all and reflect on all of my transactions. I need a concierge service. Kermesse got back to me. Such good sounds. I want to DJ again. I want to celebrate life again. I don’t think that’s right. I think we should go party together. I think it will create some sense of growth for both of us to be better. \n\nThis platform is magical. it’s just incredibly beautiful and simple. No threads. Just a place to manifest reality. Getting back to people. I need to just disappear for a bit. Just fall off the face. Just really get back in touch with nature and G-d. All these people are cool. But I need something different. I just feel like I’m not 100% sure with Hannah based on the past few weeks I feel something brewing again. I love her. In many ways. I love that she is working out. It makes me feel so good when you work out. That’s just the truth. Because I have a physical attraction to fitness. I see how you are attracted to me when I work out. It’s a whole nother level. I feel incredibly lucky.  \n \n\nNow. Crypto does something to you. Best practices to avoid crypto addiction. \n\nThey just opened a castle in Scotland for people with this addiction. It’s bad. I just checked. I am in shock - my assets & combined net worth. Truly wild. Probably time to go down to spot a bit but because of taxes I’m stuck being levered. I mean I have about 30% which is levered and could go to 0. I have another 70% which is a mix of spot market which is worth a lot. If the leveraged stuff goes negative before the end of the year, I can offset my airdrop income with losses? Need to figure that one out. Good to see Tomer today. What a fucking awesome experience. Just enjoy it. Inner harmony and peace. When you align with the universe it aligns back. I’m feeling my appetite increasing. \n\nNow maybe its time to focus on my career. I believe that through onboarding people to coinbase and airdrops I can make enough money to be fully autonomous. Just working with different people who want exposure. I can work for a different division and just get a % of sales for getting Israeli users into crypto. Most of the country can’t get in. \n\nI can sell tons of crypto into the market. If I just help Israelis get bitcoin. Do I need a license to sell crypto? Yes. I need to be regulated. I need to help people in America get in. \n\nThat’s cool. What else? Financial advisory. VC is a specific function. I”m not ready to commit to VC for the next 10 years without getting some exposure to other fields. If you’re interested me being a strategic advisor for Tectona Group and I’m going to do what I want. I’m not going to report to anyone. I’m just going to travel and meet interesting people and learn about interesting things. I will report what I want back to you. \n\nI do believe in that. \n\nBlockfi, Kraken, Coinbase\n\nUniswap, Sushiswap, Quickswap, SpiritSwap, Dydx\n\nMy lazy lion collection is currently worth at least $27k. That’s cool. But nothing. I will just hold those. It’s a great community with a lot planned. BUt yes - as the founders of the community create - the members get value. We need to create a just a moment NFT. That’s pretty cool. You can use it for whatever the community is planning to do. Where can the royalties go? The royalties go to pay Adar, Max, and Julian’s salaries so that they can work on content creation. But that’s already paying us enough to live sustainably. I think the upside is huge for being completely out of the matrix. Entrepreneurship. A VC trying entrepreneurship. \n\nI’m going to start a crypto school. I want to create something similar to a16z. But what are we going to teach? The history of crypto. I’m just going to work on the book for a year. And after that - I’ll be happy to consider joining as Partner. There’s so much to learn here. Wow. The hold-up after Biden’s comments. It’s clear the barrier to entry for participation are coming down. The credit card networks are letting us buy crypto - it’s over. We are borrowing from the banks to overthrow them. \n\nThat’s beautiful. The banks are owned by shareholders - but some are owned by taxpayers. Why is the federal reserve there? It constructs monetary policy. Which can be used to make more money and use it for certain social programs. We can pay off those liabilities more easily if there’s more money in circulation. Inflation is just bad. We just want deflation. Nope. That’s what we want. We want it to get cheaper to produce everything. We are being taught that inflation is good and healthy. \n\nI don’t mean deflationary cycle. I mean the cost of production actually being reduced by competition that can then offer better prices for more. RIght now we are becoming much less productive. We are seeing less food for higher prices. That’s what’s happening right now. Food is becoming a luxury for many families who are either borrowing unsustainably or eating less. Many families simply will lose the means to feed themselves. We will need food shelters to step it up big time. We need to automate food shelters. Just make basic food free. We need to pay for food for all. That’s something I want socialized. \n\nCan we socialize housing? We can. We can take taxes and pay a fair competition of available homes. But not if we artificially limit the # of homes. The penalty for bad government used to be basically nothing. We are seeing rising penalties in the information age for bad governance. It’s beautiful. And necessary. For progress - real progress to continue. Now - when you have representative democracy you have a lot of groups of people telling their congressperson - we are starving. We are hurting. We need you to pass these laws that help us. That’s the eternal democratic political struggle. \n\nYou’ll see more power outages, food and fuel shortages, more homelessness, crime, violence, and disease. This is the cost of failed government. We the people of the earth are responsible for all that is happening. We need to coordinate effectively and economically through the internet and take back the control. That’s the game.

{"id": "ZiLFPjnplFfciVlQ9ulMgKjQMF-lv2GVerv7tD8K5wU", "title": "La des-organización de la administración de justicia española", "body": "Si hoy, querido lector, tuviese usted que explicar cómo se organiza la justicia en España a un extranjero, a un lego en la materia o incluso a un estudiante de primero de derecho, le aseguro que encontraría no pocas dificultades y le aseguro también que, si no se prepara usted el tema en profundidad, es muy posible que se equivoque. Y no, la culpa no es de usted, la culpa es de una organización que, lejos de responder a un diseño preordenado a su eficacia, es el producto de tensiones políticas, conflictos de competencias y decisiones llamativas por no decir, directamente, desacertadas. La administración de justicia española, créame, no es el producto de un diseño inteligente sinoq eu, por el contrario, es el subproducto de las tensiones que históricamente han existido entre el poder judicial y el ejecutivo, de una parte, y entre el poder ejecutivo central y los ejecutivos autonómicos de otra.\n\nSi usted consulta la Constitución verá que el artículo 149.1,5º reserva al estado la competencia exclusiva sobre la administración de justicia.\n\n> Artículo 149\\\n> 1\\. El Estado tiene competencia exclusiva sobre las siguientes materias:\\\n> 5.ª Administración de Justicia.\n\nY, sin embargo, si usted le cuenta esto a su interlocutor o a sus alumnos estará cometiendo un grave error pues, la realidad, es que, desde el primer momento, algunas Comunidades Autónomas comenzaron a asumir (con la aprobación de las Cortes de la Nación) competencias en justicia. Mayoritariamente los estatutos incluían cláusulas de las llamadas *subrogatorias* que les autorizaban a ejercer las facultades que la LOPJ o el CGPJ reconocieran al estado en materia de justicia.\n\nEl Tribunal Constitucional, en sentencias de fecha 29 (56/1990) y 30 (62/1990) de marzo de 1990 convalidó esta práctica, sentando una doctrina verdaderamente digna de un concilio bizantino: la de la *“administración de la administración”*; construcción, sin duda, de gran mérito literario y emparentada directamente, al decir de los expertos, con el bíblico Cantar de los Cantares o, más precisamente quizá, con el romántico y bailable tema “Amor de mis amores”, canción de 1936 compuesta en ritmo de vals peruano por el argentino Ángel Cabral con letra de su compatriota Enrique Dizeo.​ Con los años la canción (“amor de mis amores” no “administración de la administración”) se convirtió en un gran éxito y se sospecha que los redactores de las sentencias citadas estaban bajo el hechizo de sus acordes durante la partenogénesis de los platelmintos referenciados.\n\nLa letra de la canción del TC (“administración de la administración” no “amor de mis amores) dice más o menos así:\n\n> El art. 149.1.5 de la Constitución reserva al Estado como competencia exclusiva la «Administración de Justicia»; ello supone, en primer lugar, extremo éste por nadie cuestionado, que el Poder Judicial es único y a él le corresponde juzgar y hacer ejecutar lo juzgado, y así se desprende del art. 117.5 de la Constitución; en segundo lugar, el gobierno de ese Poder Judicial es también único, y corresponde al Consejo General del Poder Judieial (art. 122.2 de la Constitución). La competencia estatal reservada como exclusiva por el art. 149.1.5 termina precisamente allí. Pero no puede negarse que, frente a ese núcleo esencial de lo que debe entenderse por Administración de Justicia, existen un conjunto de medios personales y materiales que, ciertamente, no se integran en ese núcleo, sino que se colocan, como dice expresamente el art. 122.1, al referirse al personal, «al servicio de la Administración de Justicia», esto es, no estrictamente integrados en ella.\n>\n> Lo que la cláusula subrogatoria supone es aceptar el deslinde que el Estado realiza entre Administración de Justicia en sentido estricto y «administración de la Administración de Justicia»; las Comunidades Autónomas asumen así una competencia por remisión a ese deslinde, respetando como núcleo inaccesible el art. 149.1.5 de la Constitución, con la excepción de lo dispuesto en el art. 152.1, segundo párrafo.\n\nLa consecuencia de estas sentencias es que, si usted va al juzgado, lo que viene siendo la “Administración de Justicia” en sentido estricto son apenas unas unidades biológicas llamadas comúnmente “jueces”. Fuera de estos jueces todo lo demás (edificios, mobiliario, funcionarios, bolígrafos, papel, grapadoras…) es parte de esa *administración de la administración de justicia* que tantas alegrías nos proporciona sobre todo, como veremos, en los aspectos informáticos. La creación de Consejos Autonómicos del Poder Judicial es la doxología natural que sigue a la oración anterior como persigue un exministro un puesto en un consejo de administración.\n\nPero no nos adelantemos, porque, a esta tensión entre el ejecutivo central y los periféricos, se yuxtapone la tensión existente entre dos poderes del estado: el ejecutivo y el judicial. También en esta tensión (ya lo adelanto) el poder judicial salió escaldado.\n\n*¡Montesquieu ha muerto!*, dicen que gritó jubilosamente Alfonso Guerra cuando, usando de la mayoría absoluta que tenía el PSOE en aquel momento, se aprobó la Ley Orgánica 6/1985, de 1 de julio, del Poder Judicial. Era esta Ley un texto legal calificado como “muy defectuoso” por la doctrina más solvente: la amplitud que concede al CGPJ en materia de nombramientos y ascensos en conjunción con el diseño de dicho órgano como premio electoral de los partidos vencedores, construyeron un engendro que, como todo buen engendro no debería haber tenido encaje en nuestro sistema constitucional; por eso, en palabras del profesor Marco de Benito, la declaración de constitucionalidad del texto por STC 108/1996, de 29 de julio, “sigue admirando treinta años después”, admiración a la que se suman los representantes de la doctrina más solvente.\n\nEsta situación dantesca no sólo no amainó sino que inluso se exacerbó durante el mandato del ministro de siniestro recuerdo Alberto Ruíz Gallardón y así hemos llegado al día de hoy.\n\n¿A qué nos ha conducido esta forma de organizar la administración de justicia que, como vemos, no responde a ningún principio ni planificación sino a las luchas por extender las parcelas de poder de los ejecutivos centrales y autonómicos siempre a costa del poder judicial? Tratemos de ilustrarlo con un ejemplo.\n\nDados los años en que sucedieron los hechos hasta ahora narrados (1985-1990) la informatización era un fenómeno aún incipiente mientras que internet o las nuevas tecnologías eran invitados a quienes nadie esperaba en los juzgados españoles. Las Comunidades Autónomas, titulares de la “Administración de la Administración” de Justicia (es decir, de todo menos de los jueces) decidieron cada una por su cuenta cómo informatizarían esta “Administración de la Administración”.\n\nComo a ninguno que conozca el asunto se le escapará, el carajal informático que se formó en esa época lo estamos pagando todavía, treinta años después.\n\nEl estado, en atención a las comunidades no transferidas hubo de efectuar un desembolso para informatizarlas, desembolso que se repitió en Cataluña, País vasco, Navarra, Andalucía… Con todo ese dinero gastado los juzgados españoles podían haber dispuesto de unos recursos informáticos maravillosos pero, al gastar seis veces el mismo dinero en hacer las mismas cosas lo único que se logró fue tener una basura informática que había costado seis veces lo que valía. Hasta donde yo sé nadie ha rendido cuentas por este desaguisado.\n\nEl desaguisado no es sólo económico, al haber una pluralidad tal de sistemas, coordinarlos es tarea de locos y da lugar a más gasto y complejidad. La historia de la informática española es la historia de cómo comprar chatarra a precio de Rolls Royce. Eso sí, los paganos de la fiesta nunca fueron sus responsables sino usted y yo junto con los ciudadanos que padecen el desbarajuste informático creado.\n\nY si a este carajal de sistemas informáticos nos condujo la tensión estado central versus autonomías, la tensión poder ejecutivo versus poder judicial nos deparó nuevas sorpresas.\n\nPor que ¿quién es el propietario de los datos jurisdiccionales que recogen los juzgados al tramitar los procedimientos?\n\nPara la LOPJ el asunto es muy claro:\n\n> Artículo 236 sexies.\\\n> 1\\. A los efectos previstos en la Ley Orgánica 15/1999, de 13 de diciembre, será responsable de los ficheros jurisdiccionales el órgano jurisdiccional u Oficina judicial ante el que se tramiten los procesos cuyos datos se incorporen al fichero, y dentro de él decidirá quien tenga la competencia atribuida por la normativa vigente de acuerdo a la solicitud que se reciba del ciudadano.\n\nSin embargo, a la hora de la verdad ¿quién custodia estos datos? ¿quién los tiene físicamente?\n\nComo ustedes pueden imaginar los de siempre: los ejecutivos autonómicos o estatales. Como ellos son la “Administración de la Administración” y ellos mantienen y controlan los 13 sistemas informáticos que hay en España son ellos quienes tratan y controlan los datos judiciales. Fastuoso. En España lo que la ley o el sentido común dicten choca siempre directamente con una realidad abstrusa que, al parecer, nadie quiere reformar.\n\nClaro, si luego el Ministro de Justicia delinque o un Consejero de Justicia autonómico es imputado, vienen los miedos y las madres mías y comienzan a inventarse soluciones de fortuna. Y no quiero recordar en este punto recientes crisis vividas por la administración de justicia española porque no quiero levantar pasiones incontrolables. Mejor callar en este punto.\n\nLa des-organización de la administración de justicia española es tan fantástica que este desbarajuste informático no ha podido ser arreglado en 30 años y resulta muy difícil imaginar cómo puede organizarse en el futuro una oficina judicial dirigida, al mismo tiempo, por el ejecutivo central, el poder judicial y los ejecutivos autonómicos y, siempre, dándose codazos.\n\nComo te decía al principio, querido lector, todo esto que te he contado de la organización de la administración de justicia española es muy difícil de explicar a un extranjero, a un español, a un alumno de primero de derecho o incluso a un catedrático de derecho procesal de la Universidad de Bolonia. Creo que no acabaría de entenderlo ni el mismo Aristóteles aunque volviese a nacer sólo para ello.\n\nSí, es muy difícil que todo esto pueda entenderse pero yo, esta mañana de sábado que me ha sorprendido con algo de tiempo libre, quería contártelo a ti. Quizá no acabes de entenderlo (yo mismo no lo entiendo) pero igual, tras este post, entiendes por qué, a veces, a los abogados nos invade la melancolía.\n", "timestamp": 1633796238, "digest": "VEjUTdVxUvIkidM2kv1BDXj9NGxB3hAR0QNga2ycbdQ", "contributor": "0xb5bF77b790f8185a6968F0B26f7Ff2610c1aAe42"}

{"id": "t0DQBgjBbuFVw9Hz_cUvKh_9LH8r3_8nrk_r7KSpV7A", "title": "The State of DAO Documentation & Knowledge Management", "body": "About a week ago, we published this tweet and received a flood of responses:\n\n[https://twitter.com/JonathanHillis/status/1443178900830527490?s=20](https://twitter.com/JonathanHillis/status/1443178900830527490?s=20)\n\nDocumentation and team knowledge management is a sore spot for DAOs. There are no web3-native solutions available, so we’re stuck clobbering together tech stacks made up of the usual web2 suspects: Notion, Google Docs, Roam.\n\nIn this article, we lay out what we think DAOs need in collaboration tools to get our work done. We then evaluate the current tools on the market to see how they stack up, including our own tech stack. Finally, we present our CabinDAO dream feature set — a Frankenstein doc tool that takes the most DAO-friendly features of a number of web2 tools.\n\nWe pulled from our experience writing docs and managing projects for CabinDAO. We asked other folks in the web3 ecosystem who are building DAOs and protocols to share their experience and team workflow, as well.\n\nFinally, we didn’t differentiate between writing and collaboration tools (ex. Google Docs) and knowledge management tools (ex. Notion). For a DAO, informal notetaking, documentation, and publishing all fall under [the team communication umbrella](https://creators.mirror.xyz/862A5rBtKX3BC8eEircDnGwPIJJTJ33hn-MvnukByPc). We want a tool that takes us from meeting notes and brainstorming all the way to the approval process for final changes.\n\nAnd with that, let’s dive in.\n\n## Essential features for DAO knowledge management tools\n\n### Multiplayer access management\n\nEnabling multiplayer access is the hardest problem DAOs face in knowledge management, specifically per seat pricing and access.\n\nThis is because traditional companies have a very clear line between employee and non-employee. As a result, enterprise software pricing charges per employee onboarded onto the product and designed with this structure in mind.\n\nIn contrast, DAOs have a gradient of engagement. At any point in time, a DAO will have a handful of major contributors and concentric circles of participants, members, Discord lurkers, and the public.\n\nThis naturally touches on the problem of access. Traditional companies with over 300 workers have entire IT departments who give, revoke, and manage each user’s access. Most DAOs have one or up to a handful of people who manage permissions for a group of similar size.\n\nEnterprise apps generally do a decent job at multiplayer access. Google Docs has the ability to manage individual document permissions. Notion also has a function to set pages as public or private. But paying per seat for non-contributors, just for them to be able to view and comment on shared documents, doesn’t make sense for DAOs.\n\nThe ideal scenario for access in a DAO is the permeable Wikipedia contribution model. Wikipedia has a power law distribution amongst contributors and editors. It remains an open source movement that doesn’t distinguish between an employee or a non-employee, but also has various gating mechanisms that outputs quality information over time.\n\n### Decentralized project management\n\nEnterprise knowledge management apps that cater to traditional companies expect a top-down structure. Projects and assignments are then assigned to individuals and groups from upper management.\n\nIn contrast, DAOs are more like a network of independent contractors interacting with each other than a company of employees. They have a bottoms-up structure where contributors write their own job description and propose projects for approval to the broader community.\n\nGithub, for example, encourages open source contributions and allows a built-in review process that ensures the quality of the contribution. It also allows developers to add issues for features they would like to work on and assign it to themselves. Github encourages decentralized project management.\n\nWhen a would-be contributor submits a proposal, the ideal knowledge management software should be able to pull the DAO’s governance or approval process, match that with the project’s specs and scope, and estimate compensation.\n\n### Web3 native\n\nMost DAOs, CabinDAO included, clobber together web2 apps to collaborate and disseminate knowledge. But these duct tape measures won’t cut for long.\n\nWith web3-native apps, DAOs can manage permissions on the doc as a group, rather than relying on a single member to gatekeep access. Instead of constantly adding new users and removing ones who leave, web3 assigns permissions programmatically. This means that DAO membership — usually signified by the existence or lack of a token or NFT — dictates access, not a fallible individual.\n\n[DAOHaus](https://twitter.com/nowdaoit)’ Spencer Graham ([@spengrah](https://twitter.com/spengrah) on Twitter) told us his ideal scenario.\n\n> “When I sign into a web3-native tool with my address, the tool can look up my status in the DAO. It then shows me what I have access to while simultaneously hiding what I don’t. This programmatic feature works the same way for deciding whether to give editing or viewing permissions to an individual.”\n\nA more advanced web3-native feature would be the ability to tie projects to bounties. And maybe even embed payment structures within the projects to pay guild members out, based on a DAO-determined contribution level.\n\n## What knowledge management tools DAOs currently use\n\nKnowledge management is a pain point for CabinDAO across the board. We're using Roam, Google Docs, Notion, and Discord all at once because none of them do exactly what we need.\n\n### Notion\n\nWe use [Notion](https://foul-buffer-636.notion.site/Cabin-DAO-668930ccc2c64e8a958aacb2686e335f) for sharing general knowledge about the DAO and our long-term vision. We love Notion’s WYSIWYG (versus Markdown) and its ability to manage permissions on a contributor and page level.\n\nWe admit it: Notion solves at least half of the problems we need for documentation and knowledge management, However, as an enterprise tool, Notion costs $8 – $20 per user per month. Without workarounds, onboarding the over 300 members of CabinDAO’s Discord server would be exorbitant and unwieldy.\n\n### Roam\n\nWe use [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/CabinDAO/page/NhaKzWlCO) for project management and internal knowledge management.\n\nRoam’s multiplayer user structure fits us. Anybody can contribute to our Roam server, without being able to delete what anyone else wrote. In this way, it’s better than Google Docs or Notion for access. Its bidirectional linking structure also makes it excellent for bottoms-up project management.\n\nFor more on Roam for DAOs, here’s a video from [@realfakepicnic](https://twitter.com/realfakepicnic) on how [code423n4](https://twitter.com/code423n4) uses Roam:\n\n[https://www.loom.com/share/7316d46335e1480eb548b4a3c1e2de86](https://www.loom.com/share/7316d46335e1480eb548b4a3c1e2de86)\n\nFrom our experience, however, Roam’s bullet-based interface isn’t a great fit for longer form writing. For folks who aren’t familiar with its block-and-bullet point structure or with Markdown, Roam has a steeper learning curve.\n\nThere’s a similar notetaking application called Obsidian that [some folks use](https://mobile.twitter.com/SpacesCreator/status/1443179660129542145), but unlike Roam, it lacks multiplayer functionality.\n\n### Google Docs\n\nWe use Google Docs for collaborative writing. It’s nice because the commenting and multiplayer features are strong. However, Docs doesn’t have interlinking capabilities. And it still has the obsolete Microsoft Word-like writing experience even after all these years.\n\n(We know –- if it’s not broken, don’t fix it. But c’mon we’re in the web3 era, here).\n\n### HackMD\n\nWe’ve never used HackMD, but it was a tool that was recommended quite a few times in the thread so we spoke to a couple web3 teams who do.\n\n[Jetpack Protocol](https://twitter.com/JetProtocol) and [DAOHaus](https://twitter.com/nowdaoit) both use HackMD as their teams’ primary collaboration tools. Both orgs use it for internal collaboration and quick notetaking.\n\nFor outside collaboration Jetpack uses [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/). DAOHaus uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) for public, more formal documentation.\n\nOne cool thing about Hackmd is that [it integrates with Github](https://hackmd.io/s/link-with-github). This way, document edits can go through a formal pull request review process before they get pushed live.\n\n### Clarity\n\nClarity is the only app on this list aiming for DAOs as their target audience.\n\nOur team just started testing Clarity so we turned to outside input for in-depth insight.\n\n[Foster](https://www.foster.co) — a writing community that isn’t a DAO but functions like one — switched from Notion to Clarity for their team’s knowledge and project management. They found that Notion got bloated quickly. Customizing their tasks began taking up too much time.\n\nThe Foster team likes Clarity for how it handles both tasks and knowledge. Foster co-founder Stew Fortier says, “Clarity is excellent because it's low-maintenance. If you're up late writing something brilliant, you can easily spin up a couple of tasks and assign them directly in the document so that your brilliant vision has a higher likelihood of seeing the light of day.”\n\nOur initial tests of Clarity found that bidirectional linking is a challenge. While its current pricing model is still on a per-user basis and stores data on a traditional web2 architecture, the Clarity team has shared their plans with us to tweak their model to serve DAOs better.\n\nAccording to founder [Richie Bonilla](https://twitter.com/richiebonilla), Clarity wanted to solve the problem of human coordination first. They’re actively working with their users to find the best way to approach decentralizing the app.\n\n## Documentation & team knowledge management for DAOs: Who will take the crown?\n\nDAOs need a way to create, edit, and disseminate knowledge in a way that's web3 native. The current tools available are mostly web2 tools. They just aren't built for a DAO’s bottom-up, multiplayer needs.\n\nAt CabinDAO, we dream of a knowledge management tool that combines the most web3-like features of the best web2 collaboration tools on the market. We want …\n\n* Notion’s WYSIWYG interface\n* Wikipedia’s permeable community protocol\n* Roam’s bidirectional linking\n* Reddit’s contribution model\n* Github’s change management\n* Web3-native token-gating, identity, and payment tools\n\nWe’d love to hear from you.

{"id": "zlQToFLEn9vSsTm3NW2ysMjpc5vHNV2EJLns2aTe0EQ", "title": "The State of DAO Documentation & Knowledge Management", "body": "About a week ago, we published this tweet and received a flood of responses:\n\n[https://twitter.com/JonathanHillis/status/1443178900830527490?s=20](https://twitter.com/JonathanHillis/status/1443178900830527490?s=20)\n\nDocumentation and team knowledge management is a sore spot for DAOs. There are no web3-native solutions available, so we’re stuck clobbering together tech stacks made up of the usual web2 suspects: Notion, Google Docs, Roam.\n\nIn this article, we lay out what we think DAOs need in collaboration tools to get our work done. We then evaluate the current tools on the market to see how they stack up, including our own tech stack. Finally, we present our CabinDAO dream feature set — a Frankenstein doc tool that takes the most DAO-friendly features of a number of web2 tools.\n\nWe pulled from our experience writing docs and managing projects for CabinDAO. We asked other folks in the web3 ecosystem who are building DAOs and protocols to share their experience and team workflow, as well.\n\nFinally, we didn’t differentiate between writing and collaboration tools (ex. Google Docs) and knowledge management tools (ex. Notion). For a DAO, informal notetaking, documentation, and publishing all fall under [the team communication umbrella](https://creators.mirror.xyz/862A5rBtKX3BC8eEircDnGwPIJJTJ33hn-MvnukByPc). We want a tool that takes us from meeting notes and brainstorming all the way to the approval process for final changes.\n\nAnd with that, let’s dive in.\n\n## Essential features for DAO knowledge management tools\n\n### Multiplayer access management\n\nEnabling multiplayer access is the hardest problem DAOs face in knowledge management, specifically per seat pricing and access.\n\nThis is because traditional companies have a very clear line between employee and non-employee. As a result, enterprise software pricing charges per employee onboarded onto the product and designed with this structure in mind.\n\nIn contrast, DAOs have a gradient of engagement. At any point in time, a DAO will have a handful of major contributors and concentric circles of participants, members, Discord lurkers, and the public.\n\nThis naturally touches on the problem of access. Traditional companies with over 300 workers have entire IT departments who give, revoke, and manage each user’s access. Most DAOs have one or up to a handful of people who manage permissions for a group of similar size.\n\nEnterprise apps generally do a decent job at multiplayer access. Google Docs has the ability to manage individual document permissions. Notion also has a function to set pages as public or private. But paying per seat for non-contributors, just for them to be able to view and comment on shared documents, doesn’t make sense for DAOs.\n\nThe ideal scenario for access in a DAO is the permeable Wikipedia contribution model. Wikipedia has a power law distribution amongst contributors and editors. It remains an open source movement that doesn’t distinguish between an employee or a non-employee, but also has various gating mechanisms that outputs quality information over time.\n\n### Decentralized project management\n\nEnterprise knowledge management apps that cater to traditional companies expect a top-down structure. Projects and assignments are then assigned to individuals and groups from upper management.\n\nIn contrast, DAOs are more like a network of independent contractors interacting with each other than a company of employees. They have a bottoms-up structure where contributors write their own job description and propose projects for approval to the broader community.\n\nGithub, for example, encourages open source contributions and allows a built-in review process that ensures the quality of the contribution. It also allows developers to add issues for features they would like to work on and assign it to themselves. Github encourages decentralized project management.\n\nWhen a would-be contributor submits a proposal, the ideal knowledge management software should be able to pull the DAO’s governance or approval process, match that with the project’s specs and scope, and estimate compensation.\n\n### Web3 native\n\nMost DAOs, CabinDAO included, clobber together web2 apps to collaborate and disseminate knowledge. But these duct tape measures won’t cut for long.\n\nWith web3-native apps, DAOs can manage permissions on the doc as a group, rather than relying on a single member to gatekeep access. Instead of constantly adding new users and removing ones who leave, web3 assigns permissions programmatically. This means that DAO membership — usually signified by the existence or lack of a token or NFT — dictates access, not a fallible individual.\n\n[DAOHaus](https://twitter.com/nowdaoit)’ Spencer Graham ([@spengrah](https://twitter.com/spengrah) on Twitter) told us his ideal scenario.\n\n> “When I sign into a web3-native tool with my address, the tool can look up my status in the DAO. It then shows me what I have access to while simultaneously hiding what I don’t. This programmatic feature works the same way for deciding whether to give editing or viewing permissions to an individual.”\n\nA more advanced web3-native feature would be the ability to tie projects to bounties. And maybe even embed payment structures within the projects to pay guild members out, based on a DAO-determined contribution level.\n\n## What knowledge management tools DAOs currently use\n\nKnowledge management is a pain point for CabinDAO across the board. We're using Roam, Google Docs, Notion, and Discord all at once because none of them do exactly what we need.\n\n### Notion\n\nWe use [Notion](https://foul-buffer-636.notion.site/Cabin-DAO-668930ccc2c64e8a958aacb2686e335f) for sharing general knowledge about the DAO and our long-term vision.

Inside the Briefing Room of the  UAE-US joint military operation.***\n\nAs soon as the US military personnel from different task forces, such as counter-terrorism, military intelligence, and others including Eagle-One and Eagle-Two, waited for half an hour inside the Briefing Room, the US military high-rank officers finally arrived. That night, General Perry also attended the unscheduled military briefing and was not informed upon his sudden arrival. Everyone was surprised because before a high-rank military officer arrives, an officer in charge usually announces to every person in the room to stand and gives their military salute. To see a military general suddenly enters the briefing room makes every military personnel who attends the briefing spontaneously stand up and gives their military salute.\n\nGeneral Perry: “At ease, gentlemen, I know this briefing is unscheduled but, we don't have much time. Washington has recently announced DEFCON 3 and with possible DEFCON 2 in a couple of hours. We currently have a crisis everywhere around the globe that somehow started 8 to 6 hours ago. Now, Russia, China, and Europe, and many other countries are reporting the same cases. We don't know what it is yet since it spreads fast and currently is beyond our ability to contain it. So far, it is known as a very deadly virus which I don't like saying about it, but after the patient's heartbeat stop, mmmm, somehow it started to walk with no heartbeat and attack other human beings.\"\n\nThe briefing room suddenly turned panic and tumultuous because not only did they think the general information was impossible to believe, but none of them knew or were informed about it in the past 6 to 4 hours ago of what happens.\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Order!...Order!... Listen! I know you are all surprised, but so did I, and right this minute, it is still happening and emerging everywhere around the world. For your information, just now, Dubai city is lockdown since a mist has also started to appear. The UAE military is now in full-scale operation to take necessary measures, so it will not spread beyond the city limit because more cases are beginning to appear. A recent report said that the escalation has turned chaotic near Dubai Marina and downtown.\"\n\nDavis begins to panic but is still in disbelieve after hearing the explanation. He starts commenting with the hope General Perry is merely joking around at the end of the year, \"General! I just talked to my wife and son half an hour ago, and they did not say any goddamn thing about what you have just said.\"\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Everyone! Please turn on your mobile phone now and call your family or anyone you know back home.\"\n\nWithout delay, everyone starts turning on their mobile phone, including Davis and Monk. The briefing room turns silent as everyone is anxious to call their family back home. Once they tried, most of them got an auto-response from the mobile phone operator: (\"The number you are calling is not active, or out of coverage area, please try again in a few minutes.\")\n\nOne of the personnel says, \"Hey, why it says my wife's phone is not active?\" Then, another personnel also reported the same thing, followed by the same result from almost all personnel in the room. Monk and Davis also got the same notification, and now they began to worry.\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Listen, officers! Every major phone operator starting from US West Coast to Central suddenly disconnected... Not only that, but the last report from Washington said that all electricity in that region is failing one by one, and every major city is in total blackout. We need to go home now! I am here to announce that all of you will receive a new task, starting now!\"\n\n## CHAPTER TWENTY SIX\n\n### The first outbreak\n\n![(Illustration 29)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lPvsEzbrgHEjC941BJOZm.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***02:00. Dubai, The Briefing Room.***\n\nInside the Briefing Room, General Perry requests every special forces' personnel to stay calm and focus on the present situation since whatever they want to do right away is hardly possible because firstly, they are thousands of miles away from home. Secondly, their country needs their services more than ever before. Thirdly, as the general speaks, the East and the southern coastal states in the US have fallen into chaos.\n\nAccording to General Perry, intel source last transmission from New York said that the first patient or patient zero arrived in New York Harbour several hours earlier on a cargo vessel. He was one of the crews of that vessel. The captain put him on a quarantine on board after he was showing symptoms of contagious illness.\n\nThe captain log shows that the first symptom of patient zero was losing his appetite to eat and drink. Several hours later, the patient experiencing a high fever and followed by a terrible headache. The patient started to lose part of his teeth. A dark purple and itchy rashes began to appear throughout his skin. The patient is showing abnormal behavior and resists staying calm as the color of his eyes is changing to yellowish red.\n\nBy the time the cargo vessel arrived at New York Harbour, every crew on board, as well as the captain has shown similar symptoms like patient zero. Everyone was quarantine, but two of the vessel crew were missing, and the CDC assumed they jumped overboard when the cargo ship entered New York Harbour.\n\nWhat was strange is when the CDC took a heartbeat test from patient zero, but the patient got no heartbeat at all, yet he was still moving around, groaning, and new sharp teeth were growing inside the mouth. The CDC report was frightening since they have concluded that patient zero has died but somehow still 'alive' and turned to behave like a wild animal.\n\nIn less than an hour, another police report came in from a shopping mall near the harbor, and less than an hour later, more police reports came in. New York City was immediately put on lockdown by the CDC with the help of the police, but the spread was beyond their capability to contain as the cops started to have the same illness. In just 4 hours, the sickness spreads like wildfire.\n\nAt the same time, a similar CDC report came in from Miami, Florida, Boston, and Washington DC in just six hours, the Eastern and South coastal part of the US with all its population was declared ill, and they must remain indoors.\n\n![(Illustration 30)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s_dkJFErUEChQ3Yeg0aW3.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\nAs the virus outbreak started inland, people reported seeing a mist. It turns denser in vast populated areas within the city limit, and it keeps expanding in just a short time, and then the mist starts covering most populated areas. Numerous reports came in from people who were trapped inside the mist. The report stated they required immediate help because they heard horrifying screams, and people began seeing monster-like creatures. Police sent SWAT teams to rescue them, but none have returned from inside the mist, including the SWAT teams.\n\nGeneral Perry concluded his preliminary report to the officers in the briefing room by stating that many US states on the East Coast have become chaotic in less than 6 hours since the first CDC report of patient zero and could spread to the West Coast. Until now, the CDC has no clue about what is happening since there is probably a cyberattack on US power plants and telecommunication services.\n\nGeneral Perry: \"I don't know what is going on right now, but the virus is spreading fast, and I recently lost contact with the Pentagon, the UN, and several military bases 2,5 hours ago. We need to go home right now and make sure that the virus is not spreading to the West Coast.!\"\n\n## CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN\n\n### Undead: the 'dead living’ state of being\n\n![(Illustration 31)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DugHjzj5ltGR_uQ0hOcyk.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***02:30. Dubai, The Briefing Room.***\n\nAfter General Perry gives a brief chronological explanation of how the outbreak began, he gave 20 minutes for a team of scientists who came along with him to explain further what they will be dealing with later? Although it seems too early to conclude what is going on or what had happened to patient zero, somehow, General Perry wants to make sure every information he has about the virus or patient zero is brief to the personnel.\n\nAs soon as General Perry finished with his opening session, two civilians scientists and a doctor from CDC, but worked covertly for the Department of Defence (DoD) from the military intelligence division to take over the Briefing Room. They want to explain further their findings of the illness and are not limited to the symptoms of the virus.\n\nDue to their covert assignments inside the US government, they started the second session without mentioning their real names to the rest of the military personnel. Instead, they will introduce themselves only by their nickname or call sign. The first scientist is a young woman. So she opens the second session by introducing herself and her field of operation.\n\nThe first scientist: \"Hi, I am Hydra. I work for DoD and specialize in biowarfare.\"\n\nThen the second scientist who is a young man steps forward,\n\nThe second scientist: \"Hi, I am Spartacus. I work for DoD and specialize in quantum physics.\"\n\nAfter that, the third person is a doctor.\n\nThe doctor: \"Hello, I am Doctor Jim. I work for DoD and I specialize in human bones.\"\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Thank you, everyone. Hydra, you first.\"\n\nHydra: \"Thank you, General. Okay. So, let's start since we are running out of time. First of all, I will say it straight forward that we are not dealing with a living being, or at least not outwardly. So far, we have known that patient zero was already dead while he was still on the cargo vessel. And maybe even before the ship reached the New York Harbor.\n\nAt that time, the Captain and the crew think he probably fainted or was asleep but, he died because of the deadly virus, perhaps somewhere right after his teeth fell out, and then he began the abnormal state, which was actually postmortem. I know you probably think he is a zombie? Well, it's true and false because at least not the kind of zombie that we know from movies, but this is the zombie.\n\nPerhaps, I will call patient zero an inverted \"dead-living\" being or an undead. Dead but not entirely. It's living but not alive.\n\nAfter patient zero arrived at CDC New York, we were 100% sure that there was no heartbeat in him, yet he still moved around and became hostile like wild animals towards other living beings. We all decided to put him to rest permanently by cutting the nervous system from the brain to the spinal cord. As I was conducting the autopsy, I found out that everything inside his body was slowly inverting. The inside becomes the outside while the outside becomes the inside.\n\nAlthough the inversion is not spontaneous but slow in progress, I can see parts of his lungs, heart, liver, digestive system, and other organs are changing. In ordinary postmortem cases, the human organs will start decaying, but in the case of patient zero, the decaying process only happens outwardly and not internally.\n\nI know it sounds weird or confusing, but we all have genes similar to plants and animals.\n\nAll I can say right now, the outward form of patient zero is merely like leaves. It grew and died, but as long as the root has not died, wherein the case of patient zero was at the spinal cord and the brain, then the internal parts of his organ will keep slowly inverting, the new cell tissue is produced from the previous decaying cell tissues. So, it did not generate a healthy tissue but a decayed one.\n\nAlthough I don't have time to check further on this matter because of the outbreak, I believe the abnormal activity from patient zero that looks like a post mortem desire to eat a living flesh was somehow to compensate the decaying cell tissues that it has.\n\nI don't know what kind of virus can trigger such inversions. But according to my research as a biowarfare specialist, this virus is certainly not natural or made either, at least not from our living environment.\n\nThank you and I will let Spartacus explain further.\n\nDavis, Monk, and everyone inside the briefing room were speechless. They hope there can be immediate action to stop the spread of the virus. They worried sick about their families. Inside the briefing room, everyone is deeply emotional, just like what happened to the rest of the world. Strangely, unlike the rest of the world, the personnel are not infected by the virus.\n\n## CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT\n\n### The inverted bones\n\n![(Illustration 32)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bom_vBMTVbGCYxZ0O5Ddb.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***02:37. Dubai, The Briefing Room.***\n\nRight after Hydra asks Spartacus to speak next, suddenly the General wants Doctor Jim to be the next speaker to brief the officers.\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Hydra, I would like Doctor Jim to speak next since it is related to a human biological subject.”\n\nHydra: \"As you see fit, General Perry. Doctor Jim, please.\"\n\nDoctor Jim: \"Thank you, General Perry, and also Hydra. Okay, so I guess I better start this session right away. In percentage, our bone's weight is only about 3-5% compared to our total body weight. It is relatively small, but bones are the basic structure of our human form. Without bones, we lose our physical shape, and in the end, we lose our form. Somehow, if there is a constant radical change inside the bones, it will ultimately change the shape. As you have known, our bone is a living tissue organism, just like a tree trunk.\n\nA tree trunk grows from the root while the root lies beneath the soil. It is also the same with us, humans. The source of our bone's growth lies at the end of our spine, where it all first started to grow ever since a human still inside a female womb.\n\nThe root of a tree looks the same as any other tree, but how it differs from this type of tree or, that type of tree comes from how the root's components are structured.\n\nIn short, normal human bone comes from collagen and calcium. Collagen is a protein, and a protein is made out of amino acids, whereas amino acids are composed of several elements, which are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.\n\nWhen I examined patient zero thoroughly, the organs were not only inverted just as Hydra said, but the components of the bones were also in shambles. That is why we named patient zero a shamble being. Everything inside him, or it, is going through a state of inversion. It becomes a disorder if compared to ours. It is slow but progressive.\n\nMy assumption, at this moment, is that the virus attacked the bond of the protein, which then forms a new bone and then radically changes the structural components. Technically, this virus is rewriting the signature of the new bones to other elements, which made the bones not composed mainly of Calcium but rather mmmm something else.\n\nRight now, we still don't know what it is or where it comes from since it is not an earthly origin, or perhaps I should say as Hydra had said... natural environment.\"\n\nEvery officer inside the briefing room was pondered by what Doctor Jim had just said, and the briefing room started to become noisy.\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Order! Order! Officers!\"\n\nAs the briefing room return to order, Doctor Jim continues with the final part of his session.\n\nDoctor Jim: \"Calcium is what makes our bone color looks brighter, but in the case of patient zero, the bone turned so dark as if it appears the bones were coming out of a very high furnace but fail to become ash and yet stays and regenerates. As I took the amino acid sample, I noticed there is no oxygen in the component, and I found a large amount of carbon and helium, which are the ingredients of our sun. So the collagen is altered, and the bone is not make out of calcium, but as I said, we have no clue what kind of substance it was since we have not found anything related to this space and time...Perhaps, it is not something that comes from this universe. Thank you, and I will let Spartacus fill in. Please!\"\n\nAs Doctor Jim ended his session, everyone inside the briefing room started to worry even more. Several faces turn pale and look hopeless.\n\n## CHAPTER TWENTY NINE\n\n### Perplexity\n\n![(Illustration 33)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y-OO7k314wore1HaFQbIi.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***02:50. Dubai, The Briefing Room.***\n\nJust as Spartacus wants to brief the officers, Hydra suddenly requests Spartacus to hold by signaling with her hand because she wants to say something.\n\nHydra: \"Excuse me, Spartacus, I need a minute to add. General Perry, may I?\"\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Yes, Hydra.\"\n\nHydra: “There is one important thing I need to conclude here, which I did not say earlier since it was the last test I conducted at the lab, well, in a short time just before the outbreak. Although the virus is not airborne, we knew with certainty that the virus spread through direct physical contact with the infected. But when an attack inside the mall near the New York harbor occurred, the security camera showed that the undead did not attack the closest victims besides her. Instead, she passed two persons before attacking the third person. At that time, most people thought she was doing some fake show for the mall, and even when people saw the blood, they still thought it was just a show. But right after she attacked another person, everyone started to panic. The two victims that were attacked and beaten earlier began to stand up and attack several people in less than five minutes. What I mean is, they turned to these undead creatures in just a short time and made the case of patient zero became more puzzling. But when I...\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Hydra. I am sorry, but we are running out of time.\"\n\nHydra was caught in surprise because the general reminded her, but she understands that it is impossible to explain to the officers about all her finding in such a short time, then she says, \"Yes... Okey. Remember everyone! Please read thoroughly the notes that we have given to all of you. It is important for your safety. Spartacus, please, and I am sorry to make you waited.\"\n\nSpartacus: \"Thank you, General Perry, and to Hydra. I believe we all have more to say right now. So, anyway... First of all, Doc, Hydra, and myself are like all of you here, a spec op working for DoD but from the non-military unit. I specialize in Quantum Physics, and I was assigned to assure that we are safe from visible or non-visible enemies, which are not from this time and space but rather a different kind.\"\n\nEvery officer inside the briefing room looks confused and disappointed with what Spartacus has just said about the comparison he made with them. The room turns noisy. Suddenly, General Perry asks Spartacus to hold because he wants to say something.\n\nGeneral Perry: \"I have been a military general for the intelligence division for more than a decade. For your information, DoD has many covert and non-military operatives that investigate several phenomena throughout the world. The DoD has many coverts special units. There is an ideology division, technology division, UFOs, archeological, and many more. What these people are investigating is not less important than what you are all here have been doing! Like every division we know, some have perished on duty, and they risk their lives and families too. When soldiers died on duty, they are remembered and honored, but not for the civilians’ division. So show some respect, officers! Listen! Our time is limited, so please, gentlemen, focus! My wife and kids are still in North Carolina, and until now, I still don't know what the hell happens to them!! So this emergency briefing is not some Indiana Jones funny jokes!\"\n\nGeneral Perry was emotional, and he immediately raised his voice after he was upset from the noises made by some of the officers during the unscheduled emergency briefing. He hopes the Special Forces under his command can be more aware that conventional warfare and terrorism are not the only threat to their nation and country. As everyone turns silent, the General says, \"Spartacus. You may proceed.\"\n\nSpartacus feels uncomfortable for a while because the general stood up for him. He sighs to calm himself then he continues.\n\nSpartacus: \"Thank you, General Perry. I am not entirely sure when all this first started, but sometime around 24 hours just before the outbreak began, dozens of reports and images in some news and social media started showing many strange-looking Oaktrees that were appearing everywhere around the globe.\n\nMost people, including world governments, at the time, think it was some social media pranks. Hours later, when the same phenomenon started to appear intensively, people finally became aware of it. Unfortunately, we all did. And when we were trying to investigate it, is already too late because the outbreak started. One of my agents was in Manhattan to check and took a sample from Central Park, but I have lost contact with him right after the outbreak.”\n\n![(Illustration 34)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Mw0OsPFrhAOjMdmwqQWPd.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n*\"WEE-oww-WEE-oww!\"*\n\nAll of a sudden, an emergency siren is heard throughout the base, and the emergency strobe light started flashing inside the briefing room, followed by an automated voice:\n\n*\"EMERGENCY!

She begins to make a weird face at Diana as if she is telling Diana without saying any words that she had to do it. Diana responded by smiling at Catherine, as if she is telling Catherine without saying a word either, \"Hey, it's your neighbor, not mine.\"\n\nOnce Catherine finally sits inside Diana's car, she sighs. Diana looks at her, and she can not hide it anymore and starts laughing, although Diana is curious about the conversation between Catherine and Mrs. Abigail.\n\nAs Diana starts her car and is ready to drive away from Catherine's apartment, she asks Catherine, “I am so sorry I laugh, Catherine. What is it with you today, and why did you sigh after accidentally met your senior neighbor?\"\n\nCatherine looks at Diana also with a curious smile because she knows Diana is phishing her by throwing a question, then all of a sudden, she laughs. But out of the blue, Mike sitting beside Alice at the rear says something that makes Catherine and Diana laugh even more.\n\nMike: \"Mommy misses Daddy. She had a bad dream, then she cried, but now she is laughing.\"\n\nDiana and Catherine were surprised by what Mike just said, and they both looking at Mike, then Catherine says \"Okay, Mr. Windbag, could you please stop telling mommy's secret to Aunt Diana.\"\n\nMike did not answer and started laughing. Alice does not understand what happened but somehow tickles by the sound of Mike's laugh, and she also starts laughing following Mike.\n\nPerhaps it is nice to begin their trip to the supercenter on that unexpected fine afternoon day for everyone to laugh. Well, at least while they all still can.\n\nCatherine: \"Diana, let's go, I am bored.\"\n\nDiana: \"Shopping is the best way to get the ladies' mood to get back on track!\"\n\nAs they all drove away from Catherine's apartment with Diana's car, Mike raised his voice and says, \"Mommy, is Aunt Rosa!\"\n\nCatherine opens the side window, then Diana and Catherine wave at Rosa. She is wearing a nurse's dress and talking on her mobile phone while holding a small plastic medicine bag in her left hand.\n\nDiana and Catherine simultaneously shout to Rosa from the car and say, “Rosa! Que tenga un lindo día.\"\n\nRosa was caught in surprise as she was still having a conversation with her office when she heard the two women shout at her from a car. As Rosa sees is Catherine and Diana with their children, Rosa smiles and waves to them. She shouts, \"*Mantente a salvo, hermosas damas.*\"\n\nAfter they greet Rosa nearby the main apartment's complex gate, the car turns to the main street and heads straight to the city of Albuquerque.\n\n**(To be continued)**", "timestamp": 1633800594, "digest": "YUhJFO0K-epPdkAnyH9CR4Reop0JcvhcFlG21B4LQUk", "contributor": "0xc1C41e3606bF2756c09c95132F528012be17f724"}

Inside the Briefing Room of the  UAE-US joint military operation.***\n\nAs soon as the US military personnel from different task forces, such as counter-terrorism, military intelligence, and others including Eagle-One and Eagle-Two, waited for half an hour inside the Briefing Room, the US military high-rank officers finally arrived. That night, General Perry also attended the unscheduled military briefing and was not informed upon his sudden arrival. Everyone was surprised because before a high-rank military officer arrives, an officer in charge usually announces to every person in the room to stand and gives their military salute. To see a military general suddenly enters the briefing room makes every military personnel who attends the briefing spontaneously stand up and gives their military salute.\n\nGeneral Perry: “At ease, gentlemen, I know this briefing is unscheduled but, we don't have much time. Washington has recently announced DEFCON 3 and with possible DEFCON 2 in a couple of hours. We currently have a crisis everywhere around the globe that somehow started 8 to 6 hours ago. Now, Russia, China, and Europe, and many other countries are reporting the same cases. We don't know what it is yet since it spreads fast and currently is beyond our ability to contain it. So far, it is known as a very deadly virus which I don't like saying about it, but after the patient's heartbeat stop, mmmm, somehow it started to walk with no heartbeat and attack other human beings.\"\n\nThe briefing room suddenly turned panic and tumultuous because not only did they think the general information was impossible to believe, but none of them knew or were informed about it in the past 6 to 4 hours ago of what happens.\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Order!...Order!... Listen! I know you are all surprised, but so did I, and right this minute, it is still happening and emerging everywhere around the world. For your information, just now, Dubai city is lockdown since a mist has also started to appear. The UAE military is now in full-scale operation to take necessary measures, so it will not spread beyond the city limit because more cases are beginning to appear. A recent report said that the escalation has turned chaotic near Dubai Marina and downtown.\"\n\nDavis begins to panic but is still in disbelieve after hearing the explanation. He starts commenting with the hope General Perry is merely joking around at the end of the year, \"General! I just talked to my wife and son half an hour ago, and they did not say any goddamn thing about what you have just said.\"\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Everyone! Please turn on your mobile phone now and call your family or anyone you know back home.\"\n\nWithout delay, everyone starts turning on their mobile phone, including Davis and Monk. The briefing room turns silent as everyone is anxious to call their family back home. Once they tried, most of them got an auto-response from the mobile phone operator: (\"The number you are calling is not active, or out of coverage area, please try again in a few minutes.\")\n\nOne of the personnel says, \"Hey, why it says my wife's phone is not active?\" Then, another personnel also reported the same thing, followed by the same result from almost all personnel in the room. Monk and Davis also got the same notification, and now they began to worry.\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Listen, officers! Every major phone operator starting from US West Coast to Central suddenly disconnected... Not only that, but the last report from Washington said that all electricity in that region is failing one by one, and every major city is in total blackout. We need to go home now! I am here to announce that all of you will receive a new task, starting now!\"\n\n## CHAPTER TWENTY SIX\n\n### The first outbreak\n\n![(Illustration 29)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lPvsEzbrgHEjC941BJOZm.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***02:00. Dubai, The Briefing Room.***\n\nInside the Briefing Room, General Perry requests every special forces' personnel to stay calm and focus on the present situation since whatever they want to do right away is hardly possible because firstly, they are thousands of miles away from home. Secondly, their country needs their services more than ever before. Thirdly, as the general speaks, the East and the southern coastal states in the US have fallen into chaos.\n\nAccording to General Perry, intel source last transmission from New York said that the first patient or patient zero arrived in New York Harbour several hours earlier on a cargo vessel. He was one of the crews of that vessel. The captain put him on a quarantine on board after he was showing symptoms of contagious illness.\n\nThe captain log shows that the first symptom of patient zero was losing his appetite to eat and drink. Several hours later, the patient experiencing a high fever and followed by a terrible headache. The patient started to lose part of his teeth. A dark purple and itchy rashes began to appear throughout his skin. The patient is showing abnormal behavior and resists staying calm as the color of his eyes is changing to yellowish red.\n\nBy the time the cargo vessel arrived at New York Harbour, every crew on board, as well as the captain has shown similar symptoms like patient zero. Everyone was quarantine, but two of the vessel crew were missing, and the CDC assumed they jumped overboard when the cargo ship entered New York Harbour.\n\nWhat was strange is when the CDC took a heartbeat test from patient zero, but the patient got no heartbeat at all, yet he was still moving around, groaning, and new sharp teeth were growing inside the mouth. The CDC report was frightening since they have concluded that patient zero has died but somehow still 'alive' and turned to behave like a wild animal.\n\nIn less than an hour, another police report came in from a shopping mall near the harbor, and less than an hour later, more police reports came in. New York City was immediately put on lockdown by the CDC with the help of the police, but the spread was beyond their capability to contain as the cops started to have the same illness. In just 4 hours, the sickness spreads like wildfire.\n\nAt the same time, a similar CDC report came in from Miami, Florida, Boston, and Washington DC in just six hours, the Eastern and South coastal part of the US with all its population was declared ill, and they must remain indoors.\n\n![(Illustration 30)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s_dkJFErUEChQ3Yeg0aW3.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\nAs the virus outbreak started inland, people reported seeing a mist. It turns denser in vast populated areas within the city limit, and it keeps expanding in just a short time, and then the mist starts covering most populated areas. Numerous reports came in from people who were trapped inside the mist. The report stated they required immediate help because they heard horrifying screams, and people began seeing monster-like creatures. Police sent SWAT teams to rescue them, but none have returned from inside the mist, including the SWAT teams.\n\nGeneral Perry concluded his preliminary report to the officers in the briefing room by stating that many US states on the East Coast have become chaotic in less than 6 hours since the first CDC report of patient zero and could spread to the West Coast. Until now, the CDC has no clue about what is happening since there is probably a cyberattack on US power plants and telecommunication services.\n\nGeneral Perry: \"I don't know what is going on right now, but the virus is spreading fast, and I recently lost contact with the Pentagon, the UN, and several military bases 2,5 hours ago. We need to go home right now and make sure that the virus is not spreading to the West Coast.!\"\n\n## CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN\n\n### Undead: the 'dead living’ state of being\n\n![(Illustration 31)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DugHjzj5ltGR_uQ0hOcyk.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***02:30. Dubai, The Briefing Room.***\n\nAfter General Perry gives a brief chronological explanation of how the outbreak began, he gave 20 minutes for a team of scientists who came along with him to explain further what they will be dealing with later? Although it seems too early to conclude what is going on or what had happened to patient zero, somehow, General Perry wants to make sure every information he has about the virus or patient zero is brief to the personnel.\n\nAs soon as General Perry finished with his opening session, two civilians scientists and a doctor from CDC, but worked covertly for the Department of Defence (DoD) from the military intelligence division to take over the Briefing Room. They want to explain further their findings of the illness and are not limited to the symptoms of the virus.\n\nDue to their covert assignments inside the US government, they started the second session without mentioning their real names to the rest of the military personnel. Instead, they will introduce themselves only by their nickname or call sign. The first scientist is a young woman. So she opens the second session by introducing herself and her field of operation.\n\nThe first scientist: \"Hi, I am Hydra. I work for DoD and specialize in biowarfare.\"\n\nThen the second scientist who is a young man steps forward,\n\nThe second scientist: \"Hi, I am Spartacus. I work for DoD and specialize in quantum physics.\"\n\nAfter that, the third person is a doctor.\n\nThe doctor: \"Hello, I am Doctor Jim. I work for DoD and I specialize in human bones.\"\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Thank you, everyone. Hydra, you first.\"\n\nHydra: \"Thank you, General. Okay. So, let's start since we are running out of time.

Dubai, The Briefing Room.***\n\nJust as Spartacus wants to brief the officers, Hydra suddenly requests Spartacus to hold by signaling with her hand because she wants to say something.\n\nHydra: \"Excuse me, Spartacus, I need a minute to add. General Perry, may I?\"\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Yes, Hydra.\"\n\nHydra: “There is one important thing I need to conclude here, which I did not say earlier since it was the last test I conducted at the lab, well, in a short time just before the outbreak. Although the virus is not airborne, we knew with certainty that the virus spread through direct physical contact with the infected. But when an attack inside the mall near the New York harbor occurred, the security camera showed that the undead did not attack the closest victims besides her. Instead, she passed two persons before attacking the third person. At that time, most people thought she was doing some fake show for the mall, and even when people saw the blood, they still thought it was just a show. But right after she attacked another person, everyone started to panic. The two victims that were attacked and beaten earlier began to stand up and attack several people in less than five minutes. What I mean is, they turned to these undead creatures in just a short time and made the case of patient zero became more puzzling. But when I...\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Hydra. I am sorry, but we are running out of time.\"\n\nHydra was caught in surprise because the general reminded her, but she understands that it is impossible to explain to the officers about all her finding in such a short time, then she says, \"Yes... Okey. Remember everyone! Please read thoroughly the notes that we have given to all of you. It is important for your safety. Spartacus, please, and I am sorry to make you waited.\"\n\nSpartacus: \"Thank you, General Perry, and to Hydra. I believe we all have more to say right now. So, anyway... First of all, Doc, Hydra, and myself are like all of you here, a spec op working for DoD but from the non-military unit. I specialize in Quantum Physics, and I was assigned to assure that we are safe from visible or non-visible enemies, which are not from this time and space but rather a different kind.\"\n\nEvery officer inside the briefing room looks confused and disappointed with what Spartacus has just said about the comparison he made with them. The room turns noisy. Suddenly, General Perry asks Spartacus to hold because he wants to say something.\n\nGeneral Perry: \"I have been a military general for the intelligence division for more than a decade. For your information, DoD has many covert and non-military operatives that investigate several phenomena throughout the world. The DoD has many coverts special units. There is an ideology division, technology division, UFOs, archeological, and many more. What these people are investigating is not less important than what you are all here have been doing! Like every division we know, some have perished on duty, and they risk their lives and families too. When soldiers died on duty, they are remembered and honored, but not for the civilians’ division. So show some respect, officers! Listen! Our time is limited, so please, gentlemen, focus! My wife and kids are still in North Carolina, and until now, I still don't know what the hell happens to them!! So this emergency briefing is not some Indiana Jones funny jokes!\"\n\nGeneral Perry was emotional, and he immediately raised his voice after he was upset from the noises made by some of the officers during the unscheduled emergency briefing. He hopes the Special Forces under his command can be more aware that conventional warfare and terrorism are not the only threat to their nation and country. As everyone turns silent, the General says, \"Spartacus. You may proceed.\"\n\nSpartacus feels uncomfortable for a while because the general stood up for him. He sighs to calm himself then he continues.\n\nSpartacus: \"Thank you, General Perry. I am not entirely sure when all this first started, but sometime around 24 hours just before the outbreak began, dozens of reports and images in some news and social media started showing many strange-looking Oaktrees that were appearing everywhere around the globe.\n\nMost people, including world governments, at the time, think it was some social media pranks. Hours later, when the same phenomenon started to appear intensively, people finally became aware of it. Unfortunately, we all did. And when we were trying to investigate it, is already too late because the outbreak started. One of my agents was in Manhattan to check and took a sample from Central Park, but I have lost contact with him right after the outbreak.”\n\n![(Illustration 34)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Mw0OsPFrhAOjMdmwqQWPd.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n*\"WEE-oww-WEE-oww!\"*\n\nAll of a sudden, an emergency siren is heard throughout the base, and the emergency strobe light started flashing inside the briefing room, followed by an automated voice:\n\n*\"EMERGENCY!

She begins to make a weird face at Diana as if she is telling Diana without saying any words that she had to do it. Diana responded by smiling at Catherine, as if she is telling Catherine without saying a word either, \"Hey, it's your neighbor, not mine.\"\n\nOnce Catherine finally sits inside Diana's car, she sighs. Diana looks at her, and she can not hide it anymore and starts laughing, although Diana is curious about the conversation between Catherine and Mrs. Abigail.\n\nAs Diana starts her car and is ready to drive away from Catherine's apartment, she asks Catherine, “I am so sorry I laugh, Catherine. What is it with you today, and why did you sigh after accidentally met your senior neighbor?\"\n\nCatherine looks at Diana also with a curious smile because she knows Diana is phishing her by throwing a question, then all of a sudden, she laughs. But out of the blue, Mike sitting beside Alice at the rear says something that makes Catherine and Diana laugh even more.\n\nMike: \"Mommy misses Daddy. She had a bad dream, then she cried, but now she is laughing.\"\n\nDiana and Catherine were surprised by what Mike just said, and they both looking at Mike, then Catherine says \"Okay, Mr. Windbag, could you please stop telling mommy's secret to Aunt Diana.\"\n\nMike did not answer and started laughing. Alice does not understand what happened but somehow tickles by the sound of Mike's laugh, and she also starts laughing following Mike.\n\nPerhaps it is nice to begin their trip to the supercenter on that unexpected fine afternoon day for everyone to laugh. Well, at least while they all still can.\n\nCatherine: \"Diana, let's go, I am bored.\"\n\nDiana: \"Shopping is the best way to get the ladies' mood to get back on track!\"\n\nAs they all drove away from Catherine's apartment with Diana's car, Mike raised his voice and says, \"Mommy, is Aunt Rosa!\"\n\nCatherine opens the side window, then Diana and Catherine wave at Rosa. She is wearing a nurse's dress and talking on her mobile phone while holding a small plastic medicine bag in her left hand.\n\nDiana and Catherine simultaneously shout to Rosa from the car and say, “Rosa! Que tenga un lindo día.\"\n\nRosa was caught in surprise as she was still having a conversation with her office when she heard the two women shout at her from a car. As Rosa sees is Catherine and Diana with their children, Rosa smiles and waves to them. She shouts, \"*Mantente a salvo, hermosas damas.*\"\n\nAfter they greet Rosa nearby the main apartment's complex gate, the car turns to the main street and heads straight to the city of Albuquerque.\n\n**(To be continued)**", "timestamp": 1633800594, "digest": "YUhJFO0K-epPdkAnyH9CR4Reop0JcvhcFlG21B4LQUk", "contributor": "0xc1C41e3606bF2756c09c95132F528012be17f724"}

As the county's tax collector, her position was one of influence among her peers.\n\nShe was good at her job because she balanced a natural ability to pay attention to detail (ie. multiple debtors, balances owed and interest accrued); the imposing physique of a bouncer; and the moral relativity of an enforcer (ie. breaking kneecaps in lieu of write offs). She was a tank of woman. Meaty and heavy, with the heftiness that comes from a life spent in the fields.\n\nShe justified her morals with the pigheadedness of those who follow the small print. No ifs, no buts. What's fair is what has been agreed to. Be it as specified in a contract, dictated by societal norms, or derived from natural law. She was lawful but not good. Ironically, she thought herself to be a kind spirit, though she was tainted by the cruelty of her craft. She was respected (one would say feared) and she reveled on it like a pig on the trough.\n\nThen the [Tower of the Black Pearl](https://goodman-games.com/store/product/dungeon-crawl-classics-79-5-tower-of-the-black-pearl/) happened.\n\nShe joined the party as muscle. It was supposed to be an easy gig. They ended up committing genocide.\n\nAfter returning from the tower and learning the truth her mind broke at the seams. She quitted her job. Isolated herself inside her cabin for months. Relied on the kindness of strangers. And gave up to insanity and despair.\n\nIn her feverish breakdown she lost half her weight. She became a corded rope of twisted muscle knots. Ripped and emaciated her mind also gave way and shrunk. The loss of grey matter left her with a black and white view of the world. She became an empty vase of a human being waiting for a reason to live, a cause to embrace, a new contract to bind herself into.\n\nSeeing an opening, one night, Amun Tor, god of riddles and secrets, announced itself in a dream to her. We don't know the details of the dream but we can guess.\n\nAt the root of the guilt she felt there was a lack of knowledge about the meaning of that fateful room and its candles. If she had only known. Unintended consequences borne out of secrets. Amun Tor, offered solace and a way to reconcile the enormity of the crime with her catalytic role in it. It wasn't her fault. The secret itself was the cause of it all.\n\nShe would devote herself to the Order of Amun Tor and become a cleric under the name of Sister Jodía, wielder of the Bone Mace, flog of Duvan'Ku. Under her sackcloth a cilice around her left thigh would channel pain and guilt into a constant reminder of her sacred duty.\n\nShe converted from lawful to neutral. She saw herself sitting at the cusp of a mountain between the valleys of Law and Chaos, transcending the petty concerns of humans. It wasn't about the acts of men, but the raw energy that fueled them. The information that shaped their motivations. Whoever could administer the right information to the right party at the right time would yield real power over humankind. This was not a power to be left in the hands of humans, less of all herself. But to the rightful god and its Order, who would chose the way and time of its revelation to level the playing field. \n  \n Decoupling motive from action, cause from effect, she could work towards a more just world and settle her debt with humanity. She became a fundamentalist obsessed with collecting secrets and unearthing hidden information. Her kind gaze and oblivious predisposition turned into a stern gaze and a severe focus.\n\nShe would visit villages as a healer, Laying on Hands in exchange of secrets. She would record them all in a small book of red pages written in a sacred cipher. The bigger the secret, the more lives it affected, the bigger the reward, the closer she grew to her god and the more divine favors were bestowed upon her. \n  \n She threw herself into her clerical duties with a maniacal focus. \n\nShe would tend to the poor and destitute, because there is no secret petty enough unworthy of consideration. \n\nShe would minister to the rich and powerful, because the higher the source, the more people it affected. \n\nShe would actively seek the gravely ill and the moribund because people in death's throes have nothing to gain from taking secrets to the grave, and would trade their souls for the hope of healing or better treatment in the afterlife. If the secret was juicy enough and the convalescent on the verge of a lucky roll, instead of healing she would \"_ease their transition_\". A secret becomes more potent the less people know about it. For her, the sacred duty is no longer about good and evil. \n\nShe is but a humble servitor of her Order. The mace of a god. A means to an end. An end that will bring balance to the fate of men and return agency to humankind. \n ", "timestamp": 1633800920, "digest": "tr_eFRc3102OXVKn3GsOd_D0BNYxPYuoKvTowALM9Ac", "contributor": "0xaFE5F35D14ee9aBdaC14Bd2D0AF575CAbaf7D9e0"}

An average dwarven kid. A tad mischievous and unruly. Nothing out of the ordinary except for his early signs of synesthesia. A condition, uncommon but not unheard of, that manifested very mildly as an ability to hear instead of smell treasure. \n  \n He worked the mines since an early age and followed the steady traditions of countless generations of well-behaved Bovrils before him. He never had big plans or dreams and was content with whatever life threw at him. \n  \n He would have remained an anonymous figure if it wasn't for the encounter with the [Black Pearl](https://goodman-games.com/store/product/dungeon-crawl-classics-79-5-tower-of-the-black-pearl/). \n\nBeing a gem of mythic proportions, the Black Pearl immediately heightened his synesthesia to a superlative degree. \n  \n Laying eyes on the Black Pearl for the first time was accompanied by the exhilaration of a triumphant military march, overwhelming trumpets and timbals, a blinding light that raised him, the euphoria of a good LSD trip, and the taste of roasted boar. All while having an orgasm, on the side. It was an unimaginable sensory epiphany. Triggered by the smell of treasure but manifested through heightened senses. \n  \n After this baptism of the senses he changed his name to something more pleasurable, D'Beau Chérie \\[*de•bau•chery*\\], because he thinks that Elven-French is quite elegant and signals good taste. \n  \n He dedicates his life to pursue the limits of what can be felt. \n  \n It is all about pleasure. All through treasure. All in his head. \n  \n His chase for gratification has been a race to the bottom and, as such, it has taken a toll. His body has grown fatter, his face redder, and he looks a couple hundred years older than he should. He has become a glistening turducken of a dwarf. \n  \n To compound the damage, his manners are now below Dwarven standards, which are known to be low to begin with. His conversations are interspersed with copious farting and belching, followed with agape roaring laughter, as in trying to get it all in again. \n  \n He is excessive in every way. He is inexhaustible, always quick with a joke (that usually only he gets) and prodigal with winks and slaps in the butts of his comrades. Noisy and messy and, truth be told, also funny. \n  \n He is a glutton for new sensations in which to get drunk. He is considered a degenerate by his peers and has been shunned by his family, cult and community. He couldn't care less. He is having the time of his life. \n ", "timestamp": 1633801312, "digest": "ygkDyL7Jw9wYRPs97RzMgv3SsJp5J_2LmHyQwdBiWMM", "contributor": "0xaFE5F35D14ee9aBdaC14Bd2D0AF575CAbaf7D9e0"}

Its family history lost in the Big March. Unremarkable house and possessions. Yuss never married, but never explained where Saul comes from. Everybody assumes he was adopted.\n\nYuss is a carpenter with a weird obsession for building gigantic crosses that he stores in his yard and are used in the [Midsommar](https://images.newrepublic.com/b015769ca73beed1ee077dc2b273c9ec77923ef3.jpeg?w=1000&q=65&dpi=2.625&fm=pjpg&h=1500) celebrations. He is a bit off, so people let him be.\n\n![One of Yuss's crosses, it creeps the bejesus out of folks.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/N4CSuCCXah2dg1G-Pv7C1.jpeg?height=450&width=800)\n\nFrom the outside Saul is just that, Saul. Simply simple Saul. Nothing to write home about. Not because he lacks in intellect or looks, but due to his self absorption and innate lack of curiosity for what lies beyond him. He doesn't care about the world, and the world repays him in kind. He is of a one track mind. \n  \n He doesn’t talk much, or at all. He avoids gatherings and social events. He doesn’t drink, doesn’t eat much, doesn’t make polite conversation or ask you about relatives and friends. If he has social skills they are rusting somewhere out of reach. He is not mean, just not there. He is 18 yo and he keeps busy every minute of the day. \n  \n He has made virtue out of simplicity. Found focus on repeating mundane tasks that hone his abilities. For example, he cleans all the windows in town, for free, and seemingly for kicks. He spends hours in each window, incessantly turning the rag in small circles. “Wax on, was off. Wax on, wax off...” he mutters as his eyes lock in intense concentration, his back straight, his arms tight. On a clear day Grisham can be seen miles from sea as the sun settles and reflects on its windows. Not that it is of much use, just a curiosity. \n  \n Some think he is a loon, others that he is going through a phase. Everybody thinks he is a simpleton. \n  \n Inside, Saul is just a kid coming off age and looking for meaning. A few years ago, he found an ancient and forgotten book from the BBM years (ie. Before the Big March) in a corner at the Town Hall. It was a spineless and broken collection of small dirty pages wrapped in a leather rag. He fantasizes that it represents the abridged knowledge of past civilizations and its different schools of thought. An elder helped translate parts of it, albeit partially and inaccurately. It is called “Reader’s Digest”. Saul thinks it is a sacred text. He sees the whole as a cohesive body and makes sense of the disparity of its teachings through the interpretation of metaphors and hermeneutical mystic messages. He has memorized it all. \n  \n A chapter called “Karate Kid for ADHD”, full of drawings of physical exercises, provides the basis for the calisthenics he practices every waking moment. Another, “Postpartum Anxiety Meditation”, explains breathing and meditation techniques that he has expanded and deepened. The one called “Marie Kondo’s tips & tricks: the sock drawer” is heavily scribbled in the margins, it must be a key passage, and it informs his ascetic approach to a decluttered and simple life. And yet another one, “IKEA like a Pro” made him appreciate carpentry, which made Yuss proud while it helped perfect his “One shot: hammer-nail” kata. \n  \n He stole the book and is now his most priced possession. \n  \n Saul’s strength is his focus and will. His discipline and inability to get bored with the repetitive and humdrum. This talent applied to muscle and mind over years of tedious practice has made him sharp and lethal. \n  \n Like a screwdriver, he may not be the right tool for every job, but when the right screw comes loose, he is the best man for the job.\n\n\\---\n\nIn his drive for perfection the mind becomes just another muscle subject to tempering. So many hours lost in meditation has filed his concentration into an obsidian sinkhole. He loses himself in its depths for hours at a time. \n  \n These recursive wanderings have also blunted his expression. An impassive stance that turns people's gaze away. Like a repelling magnetic force. Or a blind spot in the corner of one's eye. He is unseen. \n  \n A caring but unexpressive father, an awkward and solitary childhood, a shortage of human interaction and affection, and a propensity to get lost in himself has made him a detached spectator of human affairs. Desensitized, not anesthetized. He still feels for and with others but he lacks the language. He cannot relate. \n  \n Curiously enough, he is most at ease with animals. What he cannot express to others he makes in spades caring for goats, squirrels, even bees. The floodgates of his feelings are torn open when running with dogs or cuddling with cats. In these moments, a hidden Saul comes through. Playful, demonstrative and caring. I wonder if this is a glimpse of the bloom yet to come. \n ", "timestamp": 1633801622, "digest": "h4Jiby5DATEsaDbdMvD1UfYvnbx1ImPQIb4inqPbkvk", "contributor": "0xaFE5F35D14ee9aBdaC14Bd2D0AF575CAbaf7D9e0"}

{"id": "DmUC__q5Sj1P1SZkNuRljWFgJPFvP4XMbAkwQeF7fmA", "title": "Null0", "body": "I am a machine. Cogs and pistons melt with sinew and humors. A feeling and sentient machine but a machine nonetheless. I have goals instead of wants. I have maintenance needs like humans do. I don’t dream of sheep like you do, but I can visualize (what you call imagination). \n  \n I was built 5 years ago by Herophilus the famous anatomist and inventor in the city of Alexandria. I was one of the 5 fingers in my Master’s hand. Five Warforged servitors with different but complementary abilities and a single goal, to serve him:\n\n*  **Indexo** was the Juggernaut bodyguard in charge of security. A good brute with the loyalty of a pit bull and a penchant for iambic poetry. \n* **Mildo**, the smartest, was in charge of all the lab’s administration and accounting. He was as fast with numbers as ingenious with sarcasm.\n* **Ringo**, wise and charismatic, was our leader (you know, one to bind them all and all that). He also served as Herophilus First Assistant and confidant. Sweet, serene and maintainer of peace among us.\n* **Pinko** was our tinkerer and healer. Well versed in all things mechanic and biological, he helped Master in his vivisections (specially the live ones) and kept us in good order. He was a quarreler allways looking for upheaval.\n* I was **Thumbo**. As Master would say, the thumb may be the least gracious finger of them all, but it makes a hand out of a paw.\n\nMy task was to spy, infiltrate and acquire intelligence from my Master’s rivals. The philosophical field is very competitive. And the favor of a king, academic tenure or societal standing can easily sway at a moment’s notice with the introduction of a new mechanical wonder like the *flying hummingslug*, a new technique to treat hysterical humors, or a plain derivation of a favorite spell. I helped my Master stay abreast of the scientific rat-race. \n  \n I am versatile and equally skilled as courier, scout and surveillance of competing laboratories, cat burglar, pickpocket, and handler of bribed domestics helpers. I accompanied Master in trips and social events to gain access to new poaching grounds.\n\n![Master exclaims \"Είναι ζωντανό!\" with Thumbo in foreground](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YYGtpd56YYxf7HFQ5Wtq-.jpg?height=317&width=400)\n\nHerophilus was always fair, caring and kind to us. We needed him (humans would say loved) like a father. We worked as a team and relied on each other for everything, from menial repairs to fight or flight. It was difficult to tell where the lokhos ended and the family begun.\n\nWe followed a humdrum and ordinary life serving at the family’s *Horologium Tower* in the Magic Quarter, a stone’s throw from the Agora. Master had just become Grand Hireophant of the Academy. He was visibly happy, so we were all contented. Fulfilling our tasks filled us with meaning. \n  \n Then, two years ago, a fortuitous event. I still don’t know what happened but there was an explosion that killed Master and leveled the tower to the ground. All fingers were lost except for me. All I remember is flying high over the roofs as a big blue flame engulfed the tower right before it crumbled like sand. \n  \n I woke up again days later on the top of a distant building. Battered, charred and orphaned. I lost my Master, family and intention and direction. It was a second birthing of sorts. This time disfigured, confused and muted. I had lost my ability to speak. \n  \n The inquest didn’t throw any light on the cause of the hecatomb and was deemed to have been an alchemical accident. I suspect that there was more to it than a mere accident for three reasons: First, Pinko was anal-retentive about safety. The biggest mishap had been no more serious than a blackened beard. Second, it was the first time that I have malfunctioned to the point of having no recollection of events. And third, the purplish blue flame denotes necromantic magic, a field in which Master did not dare to practice. \n  \n My muteness was inexplicable. Many automaton specialists examined me and found no explanation. My thoracic piping and voice modules were intact. Yet, I couldn't even utter a sibilant sound. I was a prisoner of my thoughts. A conscripted scribe of everyday mundane mutterings. Furthermore, if fate had not piled on enough, I gained a strange ability that makes my few interactions with others a minefield of unwanted feelings. Since that fateful flight I cannot help but mirror what others feel. \n  \n If someone shares with me the loss of a child, I feel the anguish as if it had been my own. If by mistake I get too close to a rave organized by the Sacred Band of Thebes, well, you can imagine, it ain’t pretty. If someone falls prey to an anxiety attack, I panic with such intensity that my sprockets misalign. If someone attacks me with murderous intent, I feel a rage that blinds my senses until I can wash it away in blood. \n  \n There cannot be bigger penance than trying to scream without a mouth. No expression can surface my mechanical face because it was not designed for it. There is no pressure valve or recourse. All I can do is act out and wait for the spell to pass. \n  \n This heightened empath ability only manifests when in close proximity and when emotions peak (ie rage, anguish, panic, ecstasy, etc.). I can still relate and deal with humans in a day to day basis because it is more akin to white noise than a deafening roar. Still, a lull in the storm of the unpredictable human condition. \n  \n Alone, changed, confused and hopeless I became a vagrant. I avoided big towns and their multitudes. I went where the Aerides took me. I changed my name. There was no need for a Thumb without a Hand. Even if I was a first, a regressed mutant, an empath aberration of mechanical warforging, I was less than a part of the whole. I named myself Null0. \n  \n I am still a machine. Cogs and pistons melt with sinew and humors. Now I cannot avoid feelings that are never my own. I want to get rid of this curse. I want to feel free of others. Yet, I cannot help but seek company. Teammates bring a feeling of common purpose, a reminiscence of homely comforts, even at the occasional cost of emotions run amok. I still have maintenance needs like humans do. And no, I don’t dream of sheep like androids do, but I can visualize and I imagine myself screaming mad at the gods above.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p1XfM0ihsp8Hf_tm3X46P.jpg?height=300&width=490)\n\nI left Alexandria, and roamed the world, rudderless and aimless. \n  \n I survived relying on my skills. I became an urchin in Syracuse and performed small unsavory jobs for the Squidbagger Guild in Crete. For a time I joined a thief guild in Ithaca, but the violence of the gangs turned often into unbridled emotions, too much to bear. For a season I worked peacefully the vineyards of Lacedaemon, but I was run out of town by the villagers who feared my strange looks. I visited the underdark looking for the peace and quiet of solitaire confinement, until I got bored. Finally, I ended up joining an itinerant troupe of mimes. That was the closest that I ever got to my previous life. \n  \n The mime’s silent performance translated into a quietness of emotions that was a balm to my mind. Their muteness mirrored my own which, by this time, I was slowly overcoming. Our training demanded not to break character for long periods of time, even days, which I provided me with a sense of permanence. Their white faces, all similar, reminded me of the Hand, with 5 fingers that shared the same expressionless face. \n  \n I became one more of the group. I learned the trade. I adapted the thievery tools that I store in my left arm, into a disguise toolset for make up. We toured the countryside, performed in towns and villages, and led a content life. \n  \n I was specially adept at playing the butt of jokes in comic scenes that we called Vaudevilleakos. In our best nights we would make the audience laugh so hard that I would feel a tide of joy crashing unto me. I had never felt so exhausted and exhilarated at the same time. \n  \n We made a reputation for ourselves and I felt part of this silent family. We were Pulo the tragico (Puladēs of Kilikia), Bathullo the comico (Bathullos of Alexandria), Aescho the author, and Mimo (as myself) the αππογο. I was complimented for my ability to stay in character for weeks at a time (they never suspected that it was natural state of being). \n  \n We met Alki, a barbarian, on our way to Agora. He is as brutal as his mind is innocent and empty. He has a sunny disposition which added to his lack of Intelligence makes for a relaxing interaction and peaceful companionship. He has become our bodyguard and gains some coin loading equipment and setting up the stage. I enjoy his company and consider him a friend.\n\nWhat started as a way to make ends meet through drama slowly morphed into a tragic political movement. Our lead mime and writer, Aeschylus, was no stranger to controversy (I shudder to remember the mobs we incited with the Incest Scene in \"Oedipus, That Quiet Kid\"). Aescho loved to entice and excite good or bad passions with his plays. He was a sucker for the spotlight. Let them talk good or ill, the important thing was that they talked about him. I was no fan of this approach as I cannot stand exalted mobs. \n  \n A few months ago he wrote a still play called Seven Against Agora (η καταμέτρηση του μσητε κrιsτσ), where the main character Telestes escapes from prision and takes revenge against the false meritocracy that rules his city. This was the usual 10 hour play with intermissions, flowing wine, dates and cakes, and juggling. It ended with a beautiful 30 minute monologue of eyebrow ticks by an otherwise expressionless Telestes. The ruling class found the whole thing to be of poor taste and was soon forbidden. Nevertheless, it sparked a yearning in the plebe’s imagination and its fame spread like brushfire. An instant sensation. Its memes repeated as pantomimes in every corner (ie pantomemes), it was performed off-Plaka in underground forums.\n\nYoungsters took it as a flag in which to wrap their ideals, a call to action, and started reciting its most moving passages (ie. again, more acting than reciting because mime verses can only be conveyed through limbic asynchronous spasms). They covered the acropolis with graffitis of the letter upsilon \"Υ\", signifying Υictory and Υendetta of the masses against unjust oppression. They painted their faces white and organized flash mobs in public spaces as signs of protest. It was quite a sight to witness hundreds of white faces moving in waves and gesticulating in utter silence. Authorities quickly run out of patience and begun arresting anyone pale enough to be mistaken for a mime. Goths, the anemic and the elderly bore the grunt of the response. \n \n\n![Mime Revolt](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/R9GDa2Q57axORM_D1J_tb.jpg?height=600&width=900)\n\nWe should have left before this social fire consumed everything. We did not. \n  \n A week ago, the biggest mob to date confronted a phalanx of soldiers at the Hephaisteion. White smiling faces soon turned to broken red. Alki was nowehere to be found when he was needed most (probably happily wasted in a bar) and the troupe was detained, incarcerated and soon forgotten. I escaped by a split second thanks to an improvised disguise taken from a fallen guard. \n  \n Now I am back to my cloak and hoodie. I walk in shadows never showing my face. \n\nWhat is expected of me? Should I be true to my design and find a new Master to serve? That’s what I was built for. That’s what I know, where I feel comfortable and I excel at. \n  \n Or would that be regressing? I was designed with the ability to learn and the imperative to better myself. Does that mean that I am expected to adapt and recode myself a new purpose? \n  \n If my goal is not serving a Master, who do I serve? Should it be a group of Masters instead? A thing, even and idea? A religion or a God? \n  \n Or should I serve myself? - hmmm, that didn't come off right. Should I follow the path of the mime, and revel in the joy that I can provoke? It suits me well. I could make a career out of it, build a reputation, but would that be enough? \n  \n Should I serve always the same thing or can it change? Do I need to choose or just be? Like an animal. I am a machine, less than an animal since I was created by man, who like beasts were created by the gods. \n  \n Or am I a whole new being, born out of fire and magic, and I am still to find what means to be whatever I have to become? \n ", "timestamp": 1633804478, "digest": "fyhcViP_Cav_-0Swlo8hoCqY_l-nGqNH8djUPIgVOu4", "contributor": "0xaFE5F35D14ee9aBdaC14Bd2D0AF575CAbaf7D9e0"}

Most villages will offer emissaries free food and stay for a few days as a way to win the favor of the emissary's deity. \n  \n He has a sunny predisposition, is not very bright and misreads situation frequently. He is ugly as hell, 5 feet short, disfigured with boils and skin that looks like overcooked oatmeal, suckers in his fingers that seem to have a life of its own (sucking and blowing, or trembling in unison).  \n  \n Kink smiles a lot, with a big mouth always open and drooling, like a St Bernard. Inside, tons of teeth, but all wrong. Wrong sizes, too sharp, pointing at all the wrong locations.

Some extracts:\n\n• “Life is a ledger. Every creature aims to increase its net worth. Even the most basic beast aims to feed (accumulation of assets), procreate (cost effective way to recruit minions) and be content (stand above the rest).”\n\n• “In a world of business, there is one rule that stands above all else: Me First. It is rooted in natural law and, besides, I owe it to myself.”\n\n• “Intangible assets can be more valuable than coin. A favor owed, a damaging secret, a fake friendship.”\n\n• “Writing off non performing assets (friends, colleagues) is both: the sensible thing to do, and you are making them a favor.”\n\n• “A liquidation event is just one way to get rid of liabilities.”\n\nIn his little journal there is also a list of assets and liabilities, with names, dates, descriptions and amounts. A treasure trove.\n\nHe is conniving, duplicitous and revengeful. Yet, he doesn’t look threatening at all. He doesn’t smile much and when he does, it is terribly awkward in a sneering kind of way, making people eerily uncomfortable (like something is out of place but cannot be pinpointed). But again, he is friendly and helpful… in a way.", "timestamp": 1633806030, "digest": "GFrvGER7DquAkPExfWUcERuD5JqPD9znp85-Yw40UEc", "contributor": "0xaFE5F35D14ee9aBdaC14Bd2D0AF575CAbaf7D9e0"}

An average dwarven kid. A tad mischievous and unruly. Nothing out of the ordinary except for his early signs of synesthesia. A condition, uncommon but not unheard of, that manifested very mildly as an ability to hear instead of smell treasure.\n\nHe worked the mines since an early age and followed the steady traditions of countless generations of well-behaved Bovrils before him. He never had big plans or dreams and was content with whatever life threw at him.\n\nHe would have remained an anonymous figure if it wasn't for the encounter with the [Black Pearl](https://goodman-games.com/store/product/dungeon-crawl-classics-79-5-tower-of-the-black-pearl/).\n\nBeing a gem of mythic proportions, the Black Pearl immediately heightened his synesthesia to a superlative degree.\n\nLaying eyes on the Black Pearl for the first time was accompanied by the exhilaration of a triumphant military march, overwhelming trumpets and timbals, a blinding light that raised him, the euphoria of a good LSD trip, and the taste of roasted boar. All while having an orgasm, on the side. It was an unimaginable sensory epiphany. Triggered by the smell of treasure but manifested through heightened senses.\n\nAfter this baptism of the senses he changed his name to something more pleasurable, D'Beau Chérie \\[*de•bau•chery*\\], because he thinks that Elven-French is quite elegant and signals good taste.\n\nHe dedicates his life to pursue the limits of what can be felt.\n\nIt is all about pleasure. All through treasure. All in his head.\n\nHis chase for gratification has been a race to the bottom and, as such, it has taken a toll. His body has grown fatter, his face redder, and he looks a couple hundred years older than he should. He has become a glistening turducken of a dwarf.\n\nTo compound the damage, his manners are now below Dwarven standards, which are known to be low to begin with. His conversations are interspersed with copious farting and belching, followed with agape roaring laughter, as in trying to get it all in again.\n\nHe is excessive in every way. He is inexhaustible, always quick with a joke (that usually only he gets) and prodigal with winks and slaps in the butts of his comrades. Noisy and messy and, truth be told, also funny.\n\nHe is a glutton for new sensations in which to get drunk. He is considered a degenerate by his peers and has been shunned by his family, cult and community. He couldn't care less. He is having the time of his life.\n\n\n---\n\nRoll 1d30 for ***How does the smell of gold and gems manifest?***\n\n1-11: Nothing, just treasure smell as usual. At this point you are used to it, boring.\n\n12: White noise, like a vacuum cleaner. Makes you drowsy (INIT -2).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n\n13: An ethereal voice calls your name. It is soft at first. It increases in volume and urgency as you get closer. It starts playful, raspy, and enticing. As you get closer it gets annoying at first, and insulting later.\n\n14: You feel electricity in the air. Skin tingles. Hairs stand on out. Smells of ozone and burnt lint. Is like being immersed in a strong electromagnetic field. Funny weird... <let the player describe a cool effect>.\n\n15: Everything around you seems sharper and shinier. This fills you with a bouncing sense of unbound optimism. You feel… just… happy!\n\n16: A whistling tune, terribly catchy, barely audible. It's like you cannot hear it whole but, at the same time you cannot stop repeating it in your head. Over and over. Your brain is trying to fill in the holes to make it whole. It is driving you mad. Your vision blurs. You start to drool. You better find it soon :- )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n\n17: You hear the end of specially brutal symphony, with orchestra in full. It builds as you come closer to the treasure. Crescendo. A mix of Carmina Burana, Ravel’s Bolero, and Egmont’s Overture. Majestic, awe inspiring, fills you with energy and optimism, a bit frightening amidst the blasting noise. You cannot hear your companions or anything else. You talk at the top of your lungs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n\n18: Unworldly sounds with Cthulian overtones. Asynchronous, screeching, utterly alien. Outside of the human hearing range and experience. You feel 1d4: \n\n* 1) A deep sense of Awe at the enormity of what lies beyond us. \n* 2) Despair at the foolishness of human hubris. \n* 3) Fear at peeking at the unknown Unknown. \n* 4) Madness as the void stares back!\n\n19: Everything is highlighted in impossible colors. Trippy and psychedelic. It triggers 1d4: \n\n* 1) Inspiration. Your brain races with a million ideas (your Muse is screaming in your ear).\n* 2) Glee, elation, joy. Your chest cannot contain your heart (interpret it as you want).\n* 3) Inconsolable grief (your throat tightens up, you are going to cry).\n* 4) Love for everyone & everything (you have become a passive-aggressive hippie).\n\n20: A divine vision of something mundane (eg. a sizzling toaster instead of a burning bush). It provokes a deep feeling of ecstasy and rapture. Submission. In this state you obey anyone’s command.\n\n21: You feel invincible. In total command and control. You feel accomplished and complete. You talk in Capitalized Sentences. You feel like. a. God. and. Hubris. Is. YOUR. DOMAIN!!!\n\n22: Tunnel vision. Everything but the area surrounding the treasure blanks out. You are impaired for anything that is not related to getting to the gold as fast as possible.\n\n23: Impaired 1d2:\n\n* 1) You are imbedded on exquisite Rainier (which D’Beau says with an Elven-French's accent). The room spins. Still a thirsting urge impels you forwards. You are impaired until you lose your focus. In the meantime you act drunkenly, disorderly, noisily and funnily.\n* 2) You are high, smiling like a loon, with sight lost in space and a preternatural hunger for Cheetos. You move towards the treasure in a half-assed and half-witted way.\n\n24: Loud music compels you to dance in disjointed bursts of energy. Like a grain of sand in a subwoofer's diaphragm, you convulse like a deranged 70's punk. You drop whatever you carry.\n\n25: God you are hungry. It is like you haven’t had a decent meal in months. You are salivating and you can smell your favorite dish roasting in the fire, Boar au’ Vin. You could kill for a bite. If someone stands between you and the treasure you push them out of the way. If they resist, you attack them with bulging eyes and murderous intent.\n\n26: Every step towards the treasures feels like nibbling on a new and wondrous d'oeuvre. One salty caviar, another a fluffy meringue,… <insert here your favorite dishes>\n\n27: Your tongue feels a new taste beyond umami, which is already difficult to describe. You close your eyes to appreciate every bit of it. You want to memorize it but you lack understanding and frame of reference. You purr and revel in the reverie of the moment.\n\n28: Your tongue burns. Like adding mouthfuls of Sichuan peppers with every step as you get closer. Your eyes cry, you sweat and your face is all red. You are hyperventilating and feel like a heart attack is coming.\n\n29: <to the discretion of the dm and the context of the situation>\n\n30: Vivid hallucination. 1d4: \n\n* 1) There is fire and smoke in the room. You can feel it! The treasure is burning. The gold and gems are white hot and you cannot make yourself to hold them. You are starting to panic.\n* 2) Water comes rushing from the treasure and starts to fill the room. Your feet are wet and cold, you feel the water raising and pressing against you. You believe that you are going to drown, you are terrified.\n* 3) The source glows in pulses and you could swear seeing shock waves emanating from it. The room shakes and you lose your balance. Dust falls from the ceiling, the walls warp towards you menacingly, your panic controls you as you fall apart.\n* 4) At first you feel like falling. Then gravity starts to reassert itself... but it is all wrong. Objects in the room start to fall towards the source. You feel the pull in every inch and pound of your body. This doesn’t make any sense, you are screaming in horror. |", "timestamp": 1633807128, "digest": "ygkDyL7Jw9wYRPs97RzMgv3SsJp5J_2LmHyQwdBiWMM", "contributor": "0xaFE5F35D14ee9aBdaC14Bd2D0AF575CAbaf7D9e0"}

Memes to go\n\n\n---\n\n### What is CityDAO?\n\nThe CityDAO community is made up of ambitious and HIGHLY curious people exploring and building at the frontier of technology, governance and physical land.\n\nThe vision of CityDAO is to build the city of the future on the Ethereum blockchain by tokenizing land, rights, and governance.\n\n## 🔈CityDAO so far\n\nFirst, let’s do a quick recap of the CityDAO adventure so far:\n\n**Month 1: July - laying the groundwork**\n\n* **July 1** - DAOs can legally be recognized as an LLC in Wyoming\n* **July 2** - CityDAO starts (Scott’s infamous tweet)\n* **July 7** - First community call\n* **July 15** - CityDAO Discord membership crosses 1000 people\n* **July 23** - CityDAO officially registered as an LLC in Wyoming\n* **July 28** - CityDAO gets voted in on Mirror’s $WRITE RACE\n\n**Month 2: August - bolstering the treasury**\n\n* **August 8** - The First Citizen NFT sells for 6.52 ETH\n* **August 11** - Release Founding Citizen NFTs\n* **August 12** - CityDAO treasury passes $30k\n* **August 20** - CityDAO treasury passes $100k\n* **August 25** - Founding Citizen NFT sells for 10 ETH live in a community call\n* **August 25** - CityDAO treasury passes $250k\n* **August 26** - Connect w/ real estate agent in Wyoming to help with land purchase\n\n**Month 3: September - voting on land acquisition**\n\n* **September 08** - CityDAO forum is added to aid governance discussions\n* **September 15** - Dev & Design team demo the parcel viewer\n* **September 21** - CityDAO citizens vote on first parcel purchase\n* **September 27** - Citizens vote to make offer on “Parcel 6” (40 acres)\n* **September 28** - CityDAO makes an offer on real land\n* **September 28** - Offer accepted, land purchase process begins\n\n### Live footage of CityDAO going from tweet to citizens voting on putting an offer on 40 acres of real Wyoming land…in 3 months 😂 :\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vKOY51NA2DwmZbQoll1rV.gif?height=400&width=480)\n\n\n---\n\n# 🔈News & Updates\n\n# 🗞 Annnnd our DAO has officially purchased land! 🎊\n\n![WAGMI vibes right here](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FmbW8L0eDN3hh_cUBjUlE.png?height=702&width=1043)\n\n![CityDAO flag going up on the land](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/H-C4tGhmdYUCcJalTF-H5.png?height=1398&width=1054)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k2kW3fYZebFAqQJTUNbuz.png?height=197&width=375)\n\n### 🗞 OpenSea de-listed CityDAO\n\n[https://twitter.com/chadfowler/status/1444365420388044806?s=20](https://twitter.com/chadfowler/status/1444365420388044806?s=20)\n\n**What happened?**\n\nWe found out the NFTs were de-listed from new members asking why they couldn’t buy a Citizen NFT. We received no notification, e-mail or information at all from OpenSea as to what happened. We sent multiple support tickets, reached out in their Discord server, and finally got some answers after utilizing our collective networks to get a hold of someone there.\n\n**Why did they de-list the NFTs?**\n\nSince land tokenization is central to our DAO and these NFTs would give access to land drops they believe the NFTs went against their terms. They explained its because OpenSea doesn't allow listing real estate. Our NFTs are not real estate but they don’t want to support anything that could be related.\n\n[OpenSea experienced controversy](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58585342) in September with an insider trading situation. They are likely highly risk-averse right now.\n\n### 🗞 What’s next? Solution: create independent smart contract (in development)\n\n1. The new one will be ERC721 and 100% independent of any exchange. Minting will be done through our site.\n2. Once ready, previous NFTs can be exchanged 1:1 with the new ones at any time, and they have the same rights/value.\n\n### 🗞 When will Citizen NFTs be available again?\n\nTimeline TBD but we anticipate it being in the near-future. Please reach out if you have any questions or have experience in this space. We’ll post in #announcements once we have updates.\n\n### 🗞 Parcel Viewer - here’s a glimpse of the CityDAO parcel explorer! @Greg, @Bpetes, @odyslam and @scott have been on fire with this one 🔥\n\n> A web app to view & trade CityDAO land parcels\n\n[Here’s a link to a 45 second Loom for a better view](https://www.loom.com/share/a9adac738b2d4003a12ad3359e26f846).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/snbdoc4j5qWBAm4A4Kf5O.gif?height=270&width=480)\n\n### 🗞 So… Balaji’s call-to-action sounds fun.

This looks so cool!\n\n> One using a regular grid and another more curved following the site contours. *They are colored based on the slope of the subparcel (red is steeper and green is flatter). Indeed, it seems that's nearly impossible to build on some places, especially the southwest part. These are done parametrically, so we can dynamically change a bunch of inputs like street width, parcel size, street path, etc.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bnXSxJCwdw96bjriQPl9X.png?height=1438&width=1762)\n\n### 🌆 Shout-out to this vote.\n\nIs this the first time something like this has happened? 👀\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wyAuaGL3f2GlahJ-thytO.png?height=1350&width=1814)\n\n### 🌆 @Ethsol’s has been experimenting and showing the community neat ways to visualize and think about land parcels\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HpXfBZYBdv_TRP8r1ss_T.png?height=611&width=903)\n\n[https://data.geospatialhub.org/](https://data.geospatialhub.org/)\n\n### 🌆 @alexthims showcased a bias to action and created this fantastic Welcome to CityDAO doc 🎉\n\nThis is going to be a game changer for helping people get a quick download of CityDAO.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cUfBIajipYCDKfZ2zoz0c.png?height=1328&width=1756)\n\n[https://blossom-harp-c4d.notion.site/Welcome-to-CityDAO-4a111e9e3aa94f2f8e705284816b31cf](https://blossom-harp-c4d.notion.site/Welcome-to-CityDAO-4a111e9e3aa94f2f8e705284816b31cf)\n\n### 🌆 Shout-out to @odyslam for getting the CityDAO forum up and running!\n\nNext up our goal is to find ways to improve visibility, discussion engagement, and governance process to make it easier to contribute.\n\n[https://forum.citydao.io/](https://forum.citydao.io/)\n\n### 🌆 Big thanks to @JAKE and @Scott for this intriguing episode on Pod of Jake!\n\n[https://twitter.com/blogofjake/status/1438116186101895178?s=20](https://twitter.com/blogofjake/status/1438116186101895178?s=20)\n\nAlso, highly recommend dipping into @JAKE’s backlog.

Before moving out here I worked in city government as an urban planner and spent lots of time writing zoning ordinances and working with developers to help them navigate our development process.\n\nI've a background in architecture, urban design and GIS. Now I've been developing computer programming skills for automating the urban design process.\n\nyou put in an airport or helipad for Yellowstone and you're golden\n\nLand update: we put in an offer of 95k on Parcel 6! More updates will come for Citizens shortly as negotiations proceed\n\ntheir top execs are aware of it and should get back to us soon. Regardless, we are in parallel working on our own, independent way to buy and trade the citizen nfts.\n\nfeels like a historic moment, reading it now!\n\nHow do i get citizenship?\n\nQuit my AI day job to play full time in the Metaverse\n\nI’m based in NYC and spend most of my time thinking about the intersection of web3 x real assets. I’m also a governance geek interested in incentive networks that align community stakeholders and more equitably distribute value.\n\nThis is awesome. You guys have obviously been kicking ass. I've not been checking in and here you got your land already!\n\nI am experienced in Computer Vision and have recently been using Drones for mapping and training CV models to detect objects from the air.\n\nI cannot wait for property and realspace assets are on the blockchain.\n\nhave heard quite a lot of people discussing citydao lately and wanted to hop in and say hello\n\njust to discuss, casually, perhaps over dinner and not during official hours, about possibly changes in the land registration process\n\nHey all, I haven't been around for a couple months, but I wanted to say I'm blown away with all the progress that's been made!\n\nI've been doing some research into water rights in Wyoming. Here's a summary of the laws in a government memo, but it's from 2001 (and it looks like the source document could be even older)\n\nThis is one of the most interesting projects I've ever seen in crypto, not just in NFT. I'm waiting for the bar results right now, but if all goes well i'll be a cryptolawyer soon!\n\nbuying one parcel as a DAO is our first step, and allowing members to own a piece of that parcel. the city aspect comes as more people start building on the land and we deal with questions like what is allowed to be built and funding public goods.\n\nThe land is in Wyoming. It's very rural - 40 minutes north west of Cody, Wyoming\n\nout of curiosity, are they referring to this CityDAO or maybe they're just referring to CityDAOs in a general sense?\n\nCommunity Call happening now - we will go over the land parcels and DAO citizens will share the reasons they like or dislike each parcel. Will be a fun time, see ya soon!\n\nFormer commercial real estate finance underwriting pro (mostly CMBS type stuff, some CDOs) based in Brooklyn.\n\nuseless observation -- \"Kirschbaum\" (current owner?) means \"Cherry Tree\"\n\nI'd also say there's another layer of deeper questions being asked here beyond just streamlining ownership and revenue generation\n\nHey all, love what you’re doing. Awesome to see the beginnings of on chain land ownership.\n\nI am a commercial property developer from South Africa.\n\nInteresting documents on Well water quality and Disclosures from the broker today on Parcel 6\n\nExcited to give what I can to this community and hopefully build the future of cities with you all!\n\nI'm a software engineer, working on building 5G networks. Outside of that, I host The Urban Loop podcast where I talk to technologists and city leaders about building the Smart Cities of the future\n\nLast chance to vote on the land parcel!\n\nthey gave us no explanation, but it was shortly after i requested verification for the collection. i think its because our project is tokenizing real assets\n\nWhat's good citiziens of citydao, my friend just turned me on to this. Just came back from Wyoming on a massive 4,500 mile roadtrip\n\n## 🐦 Some recent tweets we love\n\n[https://twitter.com/CroissantEth/status/1443971953187069955?s=20](https://twitter.com/CroissantEth/status/1443971953187069955?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/nichanank/status/1438205060777865218?s=20](https://twitter.com/nichanank/status/1438205060777865218?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/anotherjohnbeck/status/1439325370742833152?s=20](https://twitter.com/anotherjohnbeck/status/1439325370742833152?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/gid3xn/status/1442249426668376066?s=20](https://twitter.com/gid3xn/status/1442249426668376066?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/spaghettiNFT/status/1443493722474221574?s=20](https://twitter.com/spaghettiNFT/status/1443493722474221574?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/BoredElonMusk/status/1446316443247595520?s=20](https://twitter.com/BoredElonMusk/status/1446316443247595520?s=20)\n\n\n---\n\n# ☕️ Resources shared in CityDAO\n\n[https://twitter.com/theindiedao/status/1445410822134501386?s=20](https://twitter.com/theindiedao/status/1445410822134501386?s=20)\n\n## 🎨 Meme to go\n\n**H/T to @Greg for this spicy meme 🌶**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g-6lBZ_pPFp_J5akUZtiw.png?height=992&width=898)\n\n**H/T to @Justin Kalland**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1mBD6wn2XjIHzlLImsu2X.png?height=500&width=750)\n\n### Past CityDAO Roundups\n\n[https://chance.ghost.io/citydao-community-roundup-vol-1-so-it-begins/](https://chance.ghost.io/citydao-community-roundup-vol-1-so-it-begins/)\n\n[https://city.mirror.xyz/jTi0-xQOMadDgvP_KgMOoHZaYvWJY6D7YK4bcdFz-f4](https://city.mirror.xyz/jTi0-xQOMadDgvP_KgMOoHZaYvWJY6D7YK4bcdFz-f4)\n\n[https://city.mirror.xyz/4t6MRC8re_vTuJiVqkKmJTPXBpurzwb1N3v8S6bSJJs](https://city.mirror.xyz/4t6MRC8re_vTuJiVqkKmJTPXBpurzwb1N3v8S6bSJJs)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633807183, "digest": "1HoGdPHJ4NBmLW_sEun299_QiZTl5WHQAZfa9G8J8NY", "contributor": "0x77aA943A365161e499eaFF59E936a799e6051e15"}

An average dwarven kid. A tad mischievous and unruly. Nothing out of the ordinary except for his early signs of synesthesia. A condition, uncommon but not unheard of, that manifested very mildly as an ability to hear instead of smell treasure.\n\nHe worked the mines since an early age and followed the steady traditions of countless generations of well-behaved Bovrils before him. He never had big plans or dreams and was content with whatever life threw at him.\n\nHe would have remained an anonymous figure if it wasn't for the encounter with the [Black Pearl](https://goodman-games.com/store/product/dungeon-crawl-classics-79-5-tower-of-the-black-pearl/).\n\nBeing a gem of mythic proportions, the Black Pearl immediately heightened his synesthesia to a superlative degree. Now involving all senses.\n\nLaying eyes on the Black Pearl for the first time was accompanied by the exhilaration of a triumphant military march, overwhelming trumpets and timbals, a blinding light that raised him, the euphoria of a good LSD trip, and the taste of roasted boar. All while having an orgasm, on the side. It was an unimaginable sensory epiphany. Triggered by the smell of treasure but manifested through heightened senses.\n\nAfter this baptism of the senses he changed his name to something more pleasurable, D'Beau Chérie \\[*de•bau•chery*\\], because he thinks that Elven-French is quite elegant and signals good taste.\n\nHe dedicates his life to pursue the limits of what can be felt.\n\nIt is all about pleasure. All through treasure. All in his head.\n\nHis chase for gratification has been a race to the bottom and, as such, it has taken a toll. His body has grown fatter, his face redder, and he looks a couple hundred years older than he should. He has become a glistening turducken of a dwarf.\n\nTo compound the damage, his manners are now below Dwarven standards, which are known to be low to begin with. His conversations are interspersed with copious farting and belching, followed with agape roaring laughter, as in trying to get it all in again.\n\nHe is excessive in every way. He is inexhaustible, always quick with a joke (that usually only he gets) and prodigal with winks and slaps in the butts of his comrades. Noisy and messy and, truth be told, also funny.\n\nHe is a glutton for new sensations in which to get drunk. He is considered a degenerate by his peers and has been shunned by his family, cult and community. He couldn't care less. He is having the time of his life.", "timestamp": 1633808432, "digest": "ygkDyL7Jw9wYRPs97RzMgv3SsJp5J_2LmHyQwdBiWMM", "contributor": "0xaFE5F35D14ee9aBdaC14Bd2D0AF575CAbaf7D9e0"}

Within one year, I paid my credit cards off and eclipsed a six-figure net worth while living in a brand-new luxury building in San Francisco.\n\nBut money isn't why my tech job changed my life.\n\n## My tech job allowed me to stop obsessing over money\n\nI spent my early career working in sports, an industry that is known for its non-competitive pay. I was also living in New York City, one of the most expensive cities in the world. Money was always an issue, especially because I was drowning in credit card debt.\n\nI believed the only way to achieve financial security was to advance in my career, which subconsciously tied my livelihood to my career performance.\n\nBeing compensated generously in tech alleviated this burden. By not being in a constant state of need, I can think about the things I value beyond money.\n\n## My tech job helped me understand equity\n\nI had only worked in the private sector, so I didn't understand concepts surrounding equity like stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), and vesting schedules.\n\nMost tech companies offer equity to employees in the form of RSUs or stock options. When companies grant equity, it allows employees to share in the company's financial upside. Equity grants are a method for companies to motivate employees, who now have a vested interest in the company's performance. In some cases, it also encourages company loyalty (also known as the [golden handcuffs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goldenhandcuffs.asp#:\\~:text=Golden%20handcuffs%20are%20financial%20incentives,them%20from%20leaving%20a%20company.\\&text=These%20incentives%20come%20with%20agreements,leave%20before%20a%20certain%20date.)).\n\nReceiving equity, even a nominal amount, majorly shifted my psyche around labor. Previously, I believed a salary was adequate compensation for my contributions to an organization. Eventually, I began to accept that we all should share in the upside of companies that profit from our labor and the work we *create*.\n\n## My tech job encouraged me to be a creator\n\nThe tech industry is filled with creators, not laborers. Technical people – software engineers, data scientists, and even product managers – often obsess over *creating* things. Being exposed to so many creators helped me reconceptualize labor: we don't exist to work, we exist to create.\n\nMost tech companies started with an intellectually curious creator, or creators, looking to solve a really big problem. Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook to allow students to connect with each other online. The YouTube founders created a video platform for online users to share large video files frictionlessly. Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin created a search engine for the average online user to search the Internet.\n\nActually *working *inside a company that started as a singular person's idea has allowed me to see, firsthand, what you can build from an idea.\n\n## My tech job made me realize nothing is unattainable\n\nMost tech companies started with an ordinary person, like you and me, with a really big idea. Some of those ideas have grown to be billion and trillion-dollar companies that employ thousands of people worldwide.  \n\nBefore I joined the tech industry, I assumed people like Mark Zuckerberg were successful because they were really smart, really white, and really lucky. Now, I realize people like Mark Zuckerberg are successful because they created something that people needed.  \n\nEarly in my career, I obsessed over climbing the corporate ladder because I thought that was the only avenue to make more money. Now, I recognize that the key to equity, financial freedom, and generational wealth is creating something, and then owning what you create.\n", "timestamp": 1633808478, "digest": "rN4Lta8U7aIN0_hHAOZINSDyZ9-ySCr-zuqy-IM0C_s", "contributor": "0x3E2588054b237244eC164FbCB0AF4AeC9024CB20"}

Its family history lost in the Big March. Unremarkable house and possessions. Yuss never married, but never explained where Saul comes from. Everybody assumes he was adopted.\n\nYuss is a carpenter with a weird obsession for building gigantic crosses that he stores in his yard and are used in the [Midsommar](https://images.newrepublic.com/b015769ca73beed1ee077dc2b273c9ec77923ef3.jpeg?w=1000&q=65&dpi=2.625&fm=pjpg&h=1500) celebrations. He is a bit off, so people let him be.\n\n![One of Yuss's crosses, it creeps the bejesus out of folks.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/N4CSuCCXah2dg1G-Pv7C1.jpeg?height=450&width=800)\n\nFrom the outside Saul is just that, Saul. Simply simple Saul. Nothing to write home about. Not because he lacks in intellect or looks, but due to his self absorption and innate lack of curiosity for what lies beyond him. He doesn't care about the world, and the world repays him in kind. He is of a one track mind.\n\nHe doesn’t talk much, or at all. He avoids gatherings and social events. He doesn’t drink, doesn’t eat much, doesn’t make polite conversation or ask you about relatives and friends. If he has social skills they are rusting somewhere out of reach. He is not mean, just not there. He is 18 yo and he keeps busy every minute of the day.\n\nHe has made virtue out of simplicity. Found focus on repeating mundane tasks that hone his abilities. For example, he cleans all the windows in town, for free, and seemingly for kicks. He spends hours in each window, incessantly turning the rag in small circles. “Wax on, was off. Wax on, wax off...” he mutters as his eyes lock in intense concentration, his back straight, his arms tight. On a clear day Grisham can be seen miles from sea as the sun settles and reflects on its windows. Not that it is of much use, just a curiosity.\n\nSome think he is a loon, others that he is going through a phase. Everybody thinks he is a simpleton.\n\nInside, Saul is just a kid coming off age and looking for meaning. A few years ago, he found an ancient and forgotten book from the BBM years (ie. Before the Big March) in a corner at the Town Hall. It was a spineless and broken collection of small dirty pages wrapped in a leather rag. He fantasizes that it represents the abridged knowledge of past civilizations and its different schools of thought. An elder helped translate parts of it, albeit partially and inaccurately. It is called “Reader’s Digest”. Saul thinks it is a sacred text. He sees the whole as a cohesive body and makes sense of the disparity of its teachings through the interpretation of metaphors and hermeneutical mystic messages. He has memorized it all.\n\nA chapter called “Karate Kid for ADHD”, full of drawings of physical exercises, provides the basis for the calisthenics he practices every waking moment. Another, “Postpartum Anxiety Meditation”, explains breathing and meditation techniques that he has expanded and deepened. The one called “Marie Kondo’s tips & tricks: the sock drawer” is heavily scribbled in the margins, it must be a key passage, and it informs his ascetic approach to a decluttered and simple life. And yet another one, “IKEA like a Pro” made him appreciate carpentry, which made Yuss proud while it helped perfect his “One shot: hammer-nail” kata.\n\nHe stole the book and is now his most priced possession.\n\nSaul’s strength is his focus and will. His discipline and inability to get bored with the repetitive and humdrum. This talent applied to muscle and mind over years of tedious practice has made him sharp and lethal.\n\nLike a screwdriver, he may not be the right tool for every job, but when the right screw comes loose, he is the best man for the job.\n\n\n---\n\nIn his drive for perfection the mind becomes just another muscle subject to tempering. So many hours lost in meditation has filed his concentration into an obsidian sinkhole. He loses himself in its depths for hours at a time.\n\nThese recursive wanderings have also blunted his expression. An impassive stance that turns people's gaze away. Like a repelling magnetic force. Or a blind spot in the corner of one's eye. He is unseen.\n\nA caring but unexpressive father, an awkward and solitary childhood, a shortage of human interaction and affection, and a propensity to get lost in himself has made him a detached spectator of human affairs. Desensitized, not anesthetized. He still feels for and with others but he lacks the language. He cannot relate.\n\nCuriously enough, he is most at ease with animals. What he cannot express to others he makes in spades caring for goats, squirrels, even bees. The floodgates of his feelings are torn open when running with dogs or cuddling with cats. In these moments, a hidden Saul comes through. Playful, demonstrative and caring. I wonder if this is a glimpse of the bloom yet to come.", "timestamp": 1633808634, "digest": "h4Jiby5DATEsaDbdMvD1UfYvnbx1ImPQIb4inqPbkvk", "contributor": "0xaFE5F35D14ee9aBdaC14Bd2D0AF575CAbaf7D9e0"}
{"id": "Zp83jmMeDOrK2HEUtWvWNLkIzpPViu0G8Z9DCoUNUvI", "title": "No major social media platform needs Black creators", "body": "In June 2020, Black TikTok creators went on strike to protest a lack of credit for their content on the social media platform.\n\n## TikTok doesn't need Black creators\n\nTikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese internet technology company reportedly valued at $100 billion.\n\nByteDance operates a suite of digital products including two, basically identical, major video-sharing applications: Duoyin and TikTok. The major difference between the two apps is that Douyin is available in China and TikTok is available outside of China.\n\nByteDance has built a suite of digital products that allows them to penetrate domestic and international markets.  As of 2020, Douyin had 600 million daily active users (DAUs) in China, which is more than Instagram's \\*worldwide \\*DAUs (500 million, 2020).\n\nIt's hard to fathom but TikTok's numbers pale in comparison – TikTok reported 700 million monthly active users (MAUs) internationally and $1 billion in revenue in 2020.\n\nAll of this to say – TikTok is backed by a tech behemoth that is not hurting if the latest Meg Thee Stallion song doesn't have an accompanying TikTok dance.\n\nThe narrative that a creator or group of creators can *hurt* major social media platforms is handicapping Black creators.\n\nThe current iteration of the World Wide Web is called Web 2.0. Webopedia defines Web 2.0 as the \"second generation of the World Wide Web that is focused on the ability for people to collaborate and share information online.\"\n\nIn the early days of Web 2.0, it was cumbersome to share content online. The easiest way to share content was to upload and link the content via FTP. This often required familiarity with servers (and HTML if you were publishing the content to a public-facing website).\n\nEventually, websites began popping up that allowed people to share content without creating their own websites. For example, YouTube allowed its users to share videos. Myspace allowed its users to share music (among many other things).\n\nBut it quickly became clear that people didn't want to only share their content – they wanted to connect with other people via content.\n\nAs the saying goes – the rest is history. Social media platforms proliferated, allowing billions of people worldwide to connect online.\n\nNow, social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram have millions of people sharing content every minute.\n\nGreat, *right?*\n\nWrong, or at least, that's what many would argue.\n\nMajor social media platforms have built billion-dollar businesses from aggregating user-generated content without sharing economic upside with the users who generate the content.\n\nBetween the volume of user-generated content and algorithms that can surface similar content, no single creator (or even, group of creators) can disrupt these social media behemoths.\n\nBut let's be clear that this isn't a Black thing – many people are fed up with this business model. Throw in social and political issues like platform censorship and you have the perfect storm for Web 3.0.\n\n## That's why Web 3.0 is the future\n\nCreators are past demanding recognition or compensation from major social media platforms – instead, they're building an entirely new decentralized Internet to displace intermediaries like Facebook and Google.\n\nIt occurred to me that everyone talks about the financial side of cryptocurrency, NFTs, Web 3.0, and decentralized finance. However, most people don't know what Web 3.0 actually is.\n\nIn short, Web 3.0 is the next phase of the World Wide Web that will empower creators to connect and share in the economic upside with internet users/consumers, without intermediaries or aggregators.\n\n\"Web 3.0’s decentralized blockchain protocol will enable individuals to connect to an internet where they can own and be properly compensated for their time and data, eclipsing an exploitative and unjust web, where giant, centralized repositories are the only ones that own and profit from it\" (Forbes, 2020).\n\n![](https://www.simonembanna.com/content/images/2021/08/image.png)\n\nSource: https://fabianfranzen.substack.com/\n\nWith Web 3.0, a Black creator could:\n\n* Sell their original viral video or meme (think \"Eyebrows on fleek, da fuck\")  as an NFT and keep a percentage of any future sales\n* Distribute their original artwork or music (a shrewd option for independent artists) as an NFT and keep a percentage of any future sales\n* Create a creator/community social token (think a $VRZZ coin that allows you to vote on the next Verzuz competitors, unlock exclusive memorialized NFTs from past competitions, and wager points to bet on who wins).\n\nThe possibilities are truly endless, but the takeaway should be that all of these are peer-to-peer global transactions with no intermediaries (i.e., no banks, no social platforms).\n\n## 📍Web 2.5 is where we're at\n\nWe have a while to go before the mainstream adoption of Web 3.0. But Black creators can leverage, what experts call, Web 2.5 to begin extracting economic value from their social media presence.\n\nThe following tweet sums up Web 2.5:\n\n[https://twitter.com/davenemetz/status/1429142560463724549?s=20](https://twitter.com/davenemetz/status/1429142560463724549?s=20)\n\nBased on this information, here's what Black creators can be doing today (instead of boycotting TikTok):\n\n* **Deprioritize virality.** Widespread distribution was a drug created by major social media platforms because they know they're the only mechanisms that can facilitate or guarantee virality.\n* **Focus on building an engaged community** that is willing to pay for your content (e.g., merchandise, exclusive videos, etc.),\n* **Read up on the [1,000 Fans Theory](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/)** which argues you only need 1,000 true fans to make a fruitful living.\n* **Sign up for a Web 2.5 platform like Patreon, Ko-Fi, or Buy Me A Coffee** to begin monetizing your most engaged community members today.\n* **Prioritize ownership**. People who own the content they create will fare the best in Web 2.5 and beyond.", "timestamp": 1633808633, "digest": "4OjwBxake3U6cqByTdSfPTk7BxF_npdpyraedgJ2wpY", "contributor": "0x3E2588054b237244eC164FbCB0AF4AeC9024CB20"}

I firmly believe that there must be real-world utility attached to cryptocurrencies and creator coins for mainstream adoption.*\n\n## The Initial $ISSA Offering\n\nAn **initial coin offering** (ICO) is the cryptocurrency industry’s equivalent to an initial public offering (IPO). Typically, a company looking to raise money to create a new coin, app, or service launches an ICO as a way to raise funds.\n\nAhead of the final season of Insecure, Issa would launch the $ISSA coin, a social token that extracts value from the growth of Issa's real-world brands: *Insecure*, *Rap Sh\\*t*, Hoorae Productions, etc.\n\nAs Issa leaves *Insecure* behind, many community members recognize that her empire and footprint will grow. Community members would buy $ISSA coins for the same reason they buy stock: to share in the potential upside of Issa Rae, Insecure, and Hoorae forever.\n\nBuying an $ISSA coin would give coinholders \"equity\" in Issa's empire, an important component outlined in the new Fandom Formula discussed above. In addition, $ISSA coins would unlock community benefits like voting or access to NFT drops, which I'll cover in the following sections.\n\n### How Issa would benefit\n\nIssa Rae would benefit from the $ISSA coin the same way that companies do: access to more capital.\n\nFor example, Issa Rae recently revealed that she had pitched a program featuring Regina Hall that never got picked up. With earnings from the $ISSA coin, Issa could fund and release the program without the backing of a third party (which is, lowkey, the entire point of decentralization).\n\n## Using $ISSA Coins\n\nThere is a misconception that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin should be held. But people are supposed to use coins and social tokens to transact meaningfully.\n\n### Accessing Content and Experiences\n\nLaunched ahead of the final season of Insecure, the $ISSA coin would grant unique content and experiences to $ISSA coinholders.\n\nA baseline offering for all $ISSA coinholders would be access to a Discord server, early Insecure episode previews, and an exclusive weekly, live *Insecure* post-show Q&A with talent.\n\nNaturally, Issa would want to reward her largest coinholders. Ahead of last season's *Insecure* premiere, Issa hosted a real-world block party. For her biggest supporters, she could host another virtual (or real-world) block party, but the catch this time is: you have to own an $ISSA coin.\n\n$ISSA coinholders would have the opportunity to be part of exclusive experiences and gain access to exclusive content.\n\nAttaching tangible value to social tokens builds morale in the community and allows community members to feel a greater sense of belonging and reward.\n\n### How Issa would benefit\n\nIssa providing unique experiences to coinholders would drive demand for the $ISSA coin and fuel an increase in the underlying price of the coin. A higher-valued coin equals more capital at Issa's disposal for side (or eventually, major) projects.\n\nBy being part of Issa's community, community members will also likely have a greater affinity for Issa Rae as well and want to become even more active in the $ISSA community.\n\n### Purchasing Digital Art (NFTs)\n\nIf you're on Twitter, you've heard about NFTs by now.\n\n**Non-fungible tokens** (or NFTs) are cryptographic assets on blockchain with unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from each other. Non-fungible means that it's unique and can't be replaced with something else. NFTs can be art, GIFs, videos, music, etc.\n\nAhead of the final season of Insecure, Issa would drop a capsule collection of NFTs only available to $ISSA coinholders at launch and then tradeable with $ISSA coins.\n\nIssa's community is encouraged to trade NFTs as they see which ones have the most real-world value throughout the season. For example, someone could \"own\" an NFT of artwork featured in the background of a hotly debated scene. That NFT increases in value because everyone is talking about and rewatching that scene. This also encourages the community to watch the show.\n\nNFTs also allow community members to create economies around unique artwork or content. Every Black girl I know that visits LA takes a picture in front of The Dunes apartments featured on *Insecure*.\n\nSomeone who owns an Issa-sanctioned depiction of The Dunes could sell it for 1000 ISSAS (with Issa still getting a predetermined portion of that sale).\n\n![](https://www.simonembanna.com/content/images/2021/09/thedunes.jpeg)\n\n### How Issa would benefit\n\nNFTs allow creators to retain ownership of the rights to their art but still share in the upside of their art increasing in value over time in perpetuity.\n\nLet's say Issa produces a historical drama series about *The Dunes* in 2025 that sweeps the Emmys. The demand for that unique piece of artwork depicting The Dunes would increase. And when demand exceeds supply, prices will rise.\n\nNow, the community member who owns that artwork of The Dunes could sell it for 1,000,000 ISSAS (with Issa still getting a predetermined portion of that sale).\n\n### Community Voting and Decisionmaking (DAO)\n\nA **decentralized autonomous organization** (or DAO) is a blockchain-based cooperative that is collectively owned by its members, with rules set and executed through code.\n\nDAOs reinforce the autonomy component of the Fandom Formula. Think of a DAO as a board. If I sit on the board of Facebook, I'd likely have a say in matters like their acquisition of Instagram or their metaverse strategy.\n\nA DAO would allow $ISSA coinholders to vote on matters relating to the brands behind the $ISSA coin. Issa could let the community vote on something as momentous as what show/movie Issa should produce next to something as small as what Black-owned designers Issa should work with.\n\nThe DAO allows $ISSA coinholders to have a voice in the direction of *Insecure*, Hoorae, and other umbrella brands.\n\n### How Issa would benefit\n\nA DAO would incentivize Issa's community to hold $ISSA coins to be able to vote on matters related to her brand.\n\nBeyond increasing the value of her coin, the DAO can act as an ongoing focus group, allowing Issa to gauge what her community wants to see.\n\n## Why Aren't People Doing This?\n\nIssa could accelerate adoption with the release of an $ISSA coin, but even then, we're years away from this type of peer-to-peer community being mainstream. Barriers to success are *commitment,* *mainstream adoption*, and *ownership*.\n\nNurturing a community, even a somewhat autonomous one, requires dedication. My prediction is that social media managers will be replaced with community managers in the coming years, which will ease the transition to the peer-to-peer nature of Web 3.0.\n\nMainstream adoption is also a barrier to success. It is still very early in the cryptocurrency and NFT space. Mainstream adoption of crypto and NFTs will lag for years, but the $ISSA coin could provide a fun, meaningful way for more Black and brown women to explore Web 3.0 and cryptocurrency.\n\nFinally, *ownership* is key. In order for Issa (and any other creator) to sell and maximize profits from valuable IP like *Insecure*, they must own the rights to the content.\n\n\n***\n\nIf you liked this write-up and want to dive more into Web 3.0 and social tokens, I've compiled resources below (in no particular order).", "timestamp": 1633808948, "digest": "C8v791px_-76b4H8OtKXmXNTQUUkRxKQVT7EomXmyBE", "contributor": "0x3E2588054b237244eC164FbCB0AF4AeC9024CB20"}

Community members would buy $ISSA coins for the same reason they buy stock: to share in the potential upside of Issa Rae, Insecure, and Hoorae forever.\n\nBuying an $ISSA coin would give coinholders \"equity\" in Issa's empire, an important component outlined in the new Fandom Formula discussed above. In addition, $ISSA coins would unlock community benefits like voting or access to NFT drops, which I'll cover in the following sections.\n\n### How Issa would benefit\n\nIssa Rae would benefit from the $ISSA coin the same way that companies do: access to more capital.\n\nFor example, Issa Rae recently revealed that she had pitched a program featuring Regina Hall that never got picked up. With earnings from the $ISSA coin, Issa could fund and release the program without the backing of a third party (which is, lowkey, the entire point of decentralization).\n\n## Using $ISSA Coins\n\nThere is a misconception that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin should be held. But people are supposed to use coins and social tokens to transact meaningfully.\n\n### Accessing Content and Experiences\n\nLaunched ahead of the final season of Insecure, the $ISSA coin would grant unique content and experiences to $ISSA coinholders.\n\nA baseline offering for all $ISSA coinholders would be access to a Discord server, early Insecure episode previews, and an exclusive weekly, live *Insecure* post-show Q&A with talent.\n\nNaturally, Issa would want to reward her largest coinholders. Ahead of last season's *Insecure* premiere, Issa hosted a real-world block party. For her biggest supporters, she could host another virtual (or real-world) block party, but the catch this time is: you have to own an $ISSA coin.\n\n$ISSA coinholders would have the opportunity to be part of exclusive experiences and gain access to exclusive content.\n\nAttaching tangible value to social tokens builds morale in the community and allows community members to feel a greater sense of belonging and reward.\n\n### How Issa would benefit\n\nIssa providing unique experiences to coinholders would drive demand for the $ISSA coin and fuel an increase in the underlying price of the coin. A higher-valued coin equals more capital at Issa's disposal for side (or eventually, major) projects.\n\nBy being part of Issa's community, community members will also likely have a greater affinity for Issa Rae as well and want to become even more active in the $ISSA community.\n\n### Purchasing Digital Art (NFTs)\n\nIf you're on Twitter, you've heard about NFTs by now.\n\n**Non-fungible tokens** (or NFTs) are cryptographic assets on blockchain with unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from each other. Non-fungible means that it's unique and can't be replaced with something else. NFTs can be art, GIFs, videos, music, etc.\n\nAhead of the final season of Insecure, Issa would drop a capsule collection of NFTs only available to $ISSA coinholders at launch and then tradeable with $ISSA coins.\n\nIssa's community is encouraged to trade NFTs as they see which ones have the most real-world value throughout the season. For example, someone could \"own\" an NFT of artwork featured in the background of a hotly debated scene. That NFT increases in value because everyone is talking about and rewatching that scene. This also encourages the community to watch the show.\n\nNFTs also allow community members to create economies around unique artwork or content. Every Black girl I know that visits LA takes a picture in front of The Dunes apartments featured on *Insecure*.\n\nSomeone who owns an Issa-sanctioned depiction of The Dunes could sell it for 1000 ISSAS (with Issa still getting a predetermined portion of that sale).\n\n![](https://www.simonembanna.com/content/images/2021/09/thedunes.jpeg)\n\n### How Issa would benefit\n\nNFTs allow creators to retain ownership of the rights to their art but still share in the upside of their art increasing in value over time in perpetuity.\n\nLet's say Issa produces a historical drama series about *The Dunes* in 2025 that sweeps the Emmys. The demand for that unique piece of artwork depicting The Dunes would increase. And when demand exceeds supply, prices will rise.\n\nNow, the community member who owns that artwork of The Dunes could sell it for 1,000,000 ISSAS (with Issa still getting a predetermined portion of that sale).\n\n### Community Voting and Decisionmaking (DAO)\n\nA **decentralized autonomous organization** (or DAO) is a blockchain-based cooperative that is collectively owned by its members, with rules set and executed through code.\n\nDAOs reinforce the autonomy component of the Fandom Formula. Think of a DAO as a board. If I sit on the board of Facebook, I'd likely have a say in matters like their acquisition of Instagram or their metaverse strategy.\n\nA DAO would allow $ISSA coinholders to vote on matters relating to the brands behind the $ISSA coin. Issa could let the community vote on something as momentous as what show/movie Issa should produce next to something as small as what Black-owned designers Issa should work with.\n\nThe DAO allows $ISSA coinholders to have a voice in the direction of *Insecure*, Hoorae, and other umbrella brands.\n\n### How Issa would benefit\n\nA DAO would incentivize Issa's community to hold $ISSA coins to be able to vote on matters related to her brand.\n\nBeyond increasing the value of her coin, the DAO can act as an ongoing focus group, allowing Issa to gauge what her community wants to see.\n\n## Why Aren't People Doing This?\n\nIssa could accelerate adoption with the release of an $ISSA coin, but even then, we're years away from this type of peer-to-peer community being mainstream. Barriers to success are *commitment,* *mainstream adoption*, and *ownership*.\n\nNurturing a community, even a somewhat autonomous one, requires dedication. My prediction is that social media managers will be replaced with community managers in the coming years, which will ease the transition to the peer-to-peer nature of Web 3.0.\n\nMainstream adoption is also a barrier to success. It is still very early in the cryptocurrency and NFT space. Mainstream adoption of crypto and NFTs will lag for years, but the $ISSA coin could provide a fun, meaningful way for more Black and brown women to explore Web 3.0 and cryptocurrency.\n\nFinally, *ownership* is key. In order for Issa (and any other creator) to sell and maximize profits from valuable IP like *Insecure*, they must own the rights to the content.\n\n\n***\n\nIf you liked this write-up and want to dive more into Web 3.0 and social tokens, I've compiled resources below (in no particular order).\n\n[https://raindrop.io/simonembanna/further-reading-19794252](https://raindrop.io/simonembanna/further-reading-19794252)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633809109, "digest": "C8v791px_-76b4H8OtKXmXNTQUUkRxKQVT7EomXmyBE", "contributor": "0x3E2588054b237244eC164FbCB0AF4AeC9024CB20"}

{"id": "qGpmc8rnPOCVkuiXpE-IIcU1E1i2XRNdeE826GI1bEQ", "title": "No major social media platform needs Black creators", "body": "In June 2020, Black TikTok creators went on strike to protest a lack of credit for their content on the social media platform.\n\n## TikTok doesn't need Black creators\n\nTikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese internet technology company reportedly valued at $100 billion.\n\nByteDance operates a suite of digital products including two, basically identical, major video-sharing applications: Duoyin and TikTok. The major difference between the two apps is that Douyin is available in China and TikTok is available outside of China.\n\nByteDance has built a suite of digital products that allows them to penetrate domestic and international markets.  As of 2020, Douyin had 600 million daily active users (DAUs) in China, which is more than Instagram's \\*worldwide \\*DAUs (500 million, 2020).\n\nIt's hard to fathom but TikTok's numbers pale in comparison – TikTok reported 700 million monthly active users (MAUs) internationally and $1 billion in revenue in 2020.\n\nAll of this to say – TikTok is backed by a tech behemoth that is not hurting if the latest Meg Thee Stallion song doesn't have an accompanying TikTok dance.\n\nThe narrative that a creator or group of creators can *hurt* major social media platforms is handicapping Black creators.\n\nThe current iteration of the World Wide Web is called Web 2.0. Webopedia defines Web 2.0 as the \"second generation of the World Wide Web that is focused on the ability for people to collaborate and share information online.\"\n\nIn the early days of Web 2.0, it was cumbersome to share content online. The easiest way to share content was to upload and link the content via FTP. This often required familiarity with servers (and HTML if you were publishing the content to a public-facing website).\n\nEventually, websites began popping up that allowed people to share content without creating their own websites. For example, YouTube allowed its users to share videos. Myspace allowed its users to share music (among many other things).\n\nBut it quickly became clear that people didn't want to only share their content – they wanted to connect with other people via content.\n\nAs the saying goes – the rest is history. Social media platforms proliferated, allowing billions of people worldwide to connect online.\n\nNow, social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram have millions of people sharing content every minute.\n\nGreat, *right?*\n\nWrong, or at least, that's what many would argue.\n\nMajor social media platforms have built billion-dollar businesses from aggregating user-generated content without sharing economic upside with the users who generate the content.\n\nBetween the volume of user-generated content and algorithms that can surface similar content, no single creator (or even, group of creators) can disrupt these social media behemoths.\n\nBut let's be clear that this isn't a Black thing – many people are fed up with this business model. Throw in social and political issues like platform censorship and you have the perfect storm for Web 3.0.\n\n## That's why Web 3.0 is the future\n\nCreators are past demanding recognition or compensation from major social media platforms – instead, they're building an entirely new decentralized Internet to displace intermediaries like Facebook and Google.\n\nIt occurred to me that everyone talks about the financial side of cryptocurrency, NFTs, Web 3.0, and decentralized finance. However, most people don't know what Web 3.0 actually is.\n\nIn short, Web 3.0 is the next phase of the World Wide Web that will empower creators to connect and share in the economic upside with internet users/consumers, without intermediaries or aggregators.\n\n\"Web 3.0’s decentralized blockchain protocol will enable individuals to connect to an internet where they can own and be properly compensated for their time and data, eclipsing an exploitative and unjust web, where giant, centralized repositories are the only ones that own and profit from it\" (Forbes, 2020).\n\n![](https://www.simonembanna.com/content/images/2021/08/image.png)\n\nSource: https://fabianfranzen.substack.com/\n\nWith Web 3.0, a Black creator could:\n\n* Sell their original viral video or meme (think \"Eyebrows on fleek, da fuck\")  as an NFT and keep a percentage of any future sales\n* Distribute their original artwork or music (a shrewd option for independent artists) as an NFT and keep a percentage of any future sales\n* Create a creator/community social token (think a $VRZZ coin that allows you to vote on the next Verzuz competitors, unlock exclusive memorialized NFTs from past competitions, and wager points to bet on who wins).\n\nThe possibilities are truly endless, but the takeaway should be that all of these are peer-to-peer global transactions with no intermediaries (i.e., no banks, no social platforms).\n\n## 📍Web 2.5 is where we're at\n\nWe have a while to go before the mainstream adoption of Web 3.0. But Black creators can leverage, what experts call, Web 2.5 to begin extracting economic value from their social media presence.\n\nThe following tweet sums up Web 2.5:\n\n[https://twitter.com/davenemetz/status/1429142560463724549?s=20](https://twitter.com/davenemetz/status/1429142560463724549?s=20)\n\nBased on this information, here's what Black creators can be doing today (instead of boycotting TikTok):\n\n* **Deprioritize virality.** Widespread distribution was a drug created by major social media platforms because they know they're the only mechanisms that can facilitate or guarantee virality.\n* **Focus on building an engaged community** that is willing to pay for your content (e.g., merchandise, exclusive videos, etc.),\n* **Read up on the [1,000 Fans Theory](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/)** which argues you only need 1,000 true fans to make a fruitful living.\n* **Sign up for a Web 2.5 platform like Patreon, Ko-Fi, or Buy Me A Coffee** to begin monetizing your most engaged community members today.\n* **Prioritize ownership**. People who own the content they create will fare the best in Web 2.5 and beyond.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n[https://raindrop.io/simonembanna/further-reading-19794252/embed/search=%23tiktok](https://raindrop.io/simonembanna/further-reading-19794252/embed/search=%23tiktok)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633809320, "digest": "4OjwBxake3U6cqByTdSfPTk7BxF_npdpyraedgJ2wpY", "contributor": "0x3E2588054b237244eC164FbCB0AF4AeC9024CB20"}
{"id": "i48osifbFCtV5Y5unKn7U-Aob2LLEw79WK02M66WSpA", "title": "Null0", "body": "I am a machine. Cogs and pistons melt with sinew and humors. A feeling and sentient machine but a machine nonetheless. I have goals instead of wants. I have maintenance needs like humans do. I don’t dream of sheep like you do, but I can visualize (what you call imagination).\n\nI was built 5 years ago by Herophilus the famous anatomist and inventor in the city of Alexandria. I was one of the 5 fingers in my Master’s hand. Five Warforged servitors with different but complementary abilities and a single goal, to serve him:\n\n* **Indexo** was the Juggernaut bodyguard in charge of security. A good brute with the loyalty of a pit bull and a penchant for iambic poetry.\n* **Mildo**, the smartest, was in charge of all the lab’s administration and accounting. He was as fast with numbers as ingenious with sarcasm.\n* **Ringo**, wise and charismatic, was our leader (you know, one to bind them all and all that). He also served as Herophilus First Assistant and confidant. Sweet, serene and maintainer of peace among us.\n* **Pinko** was our tinkerer and healer. Well versed in all things mechanic and biological, he helped Master in his vivisections (specially the live ones) and kept us in good order. He was a quarreler allways looking for upheaval.\n* I was **Thumbo**. As Master would say, the thumb may be the least gracious finger of them all, but it makes a hand out of a paw.\n\nMy task was to spy, infiltrate and acquire intelligence from my Master’s rivals. The philosophical field is very competitive. And the favor of a king, academic tenure or societal standing can easily sway at a moment’s notice with the introduction of a new mechanical wonder like the *flying hummingslug*, a new technique to treat hysterical humors, or a plain derivation of a favorite spell. I helped my Master stay abreast of the scientific rat-race.\n\nI am versatile and equally skilled as courier, scout and surveillance of competing laboratories, cat burglar, pickpocket, and handler of bribed domestics helpers. I accompanied Master in trips and social events to gain access to new poaching grounds.\n\n![Master exclaims \"Είναι ζωντανό!\" with Thumbo in foreground](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YYGtpd56YYxf7HFQ5Wtq-.jpg?height=317&width=400)\n\nHerophilus was always fair, caring and kind to us. We needed him (humans would say loved) like a father. We worked as a team and relied on each other for everything, from menial repairs to fight or flight. It was difficult to tell where the lokhos ended and the family begun.\n\nWe followed a humdrum and ordinary life serving at the family’s *Horologium Tower* in the Magic Quarter, a stone’s throw from the Agora. Master had just become Grand Hireophant of the Academy. He was visibly happy, so we were all contented. Fulfilling our tasks filled us with meaning.\n\n\n---\n\nThen, two years ago, a fortuitous event. I still don’t know what happened but there was an explosion that killed Master and leveled the tower to the ground. All fingers were lost except for me. All I remember is flying high over the roofs as a big blue flame engulfed the tower right before it crumbled like sand.\n\nI woke up again days later on the top of a distant building. Battered, charred and orphaned. I lost my Master, family and intention and direction. It was a second birthing of sorts. This time disfigured, confused and muted. I had lost my ability to speak.\n\nThe inquest didn’t throw any light on the cause of the hecatomb and was deemed to have been an alchemical accident. I suspect that there was more to it than a mere accident for three reasons: First, Pinko was anal-retentive about safety. The biggest mishap had been no more serious than a blackened beard. Second, it was the first time that I have malfunctioned to the point of having no recollection of events. And third, the purplish blue flame denotes necromantic magic, a field in which Master did not dare to practice.\n\nMy muteness was inexplicable. Many automaton specialists examined me and found no explanation. My thoracic piping and voice modules were intact. Yet, I couldn't even utter a sibilant sound. I was a prisoner of my thoughts. A conscripted scribe of everyday mundane mutterings. Furthermore, if fate had not piled on enough, I gained a strange ability that makes my few interactions with others a minefield of unwanted feelings. Since that fateful flight I cannot help but mirror what others feel.\n\nIf someone shares with me the loss of a child, I feel the anguish as if it had been my own. If by mistake I get too close to a rave organized by the Sacred Band of Thebes, well, you can imagine, it ain’t pretty. If someone falls prey to an anxiety attack, I panic with such intensity that my sprockets misalign. If someone attacks me with murderous intent, I feel a rage that blinds my senses until I can wash it away in blood.\n\nThere cannot be bigger penance than trying to scream without a mouth. No expression can surface my mechanical face because it was not designed for it. There is no pressure valve or recourse. All I can do is act out and wait for the spell to pass.\n\nThis heightened empath ability only manifests when in close proximity and when emotions peak (ie rage, anguish, panic, ecstasy, etc.). I can still relate and deal with humans in a day to day basis because it is more akin to white noise than a deafening roar. Still, a lull in the storm of the unpredictable human condition.\n\nAlone, changed, confused and hopeless I became a vagrant. I avoided big towns and their multitudes. I went where the Aerides took me. I changed my name. There was no need for a Thumb without a Hand. Even if I was a first, a regressed mutant, an empath aberration of mechanical warforging, I was less than a part of the whole. I named myself Null0.\n\nI am still a machine. Cogs and pistons melt with sinew and humors. Now I cannot avoid feelings that are never my own. I want to get rid of this curse. I want to feel free of others. Yet, I cannot help but seek company. Teammates bring a feeling of common purpose, a reminiscence of homely comforts, even at the occasional cost of emotions run amok. I still have maintenance needs like humans do. And no, I don’t dream of sheep like androids do, but I can visualize and I imagine myself screaming mad at the gods above.\n\n\n---\n\nI left Alexandria, and roamed the world, rudderless and aimless.\n\nI survived relying on my skills. I became an urchin in Syracuse and performed small unsavory jobs for the Squidbagger Guild in Crete. For a time I joined a thief guild in Ithaca, but the violence of the gangs turned often into unbridled emotions, too much to bear. For a season I worked peacefully the vineyards of Lacedaemon, but I was run out of town by the villagers who feared my strange looks. I visited the underdark looking for the peace and quiet of solitaire confinement, until I got bored. Finally, I ended up joining an itinerant troupe of mimes. That was the closest that I ever got to my previous life.\n\nThe mime’s silent performance translated into a quietness of emotions that was a balm to my mind. Their muteness mirrored my own which, by this time, I was slowly overcoming. Our training demanded not to break character for long periods of time, even days, which I provided me with a sense of permanence. Their white faces, all similar, reminded me of the Hand, with 5 fingers that shared the same expressionless face.\n\nI became one more of the group. I learned the trade. I adapted the thievery tools that I store in my left arm, into a disguise toolset for make up. We toured the countryside, performed in towns and villages, and led a content life.\n\nI was specially adept at playing the butt of jokes in comic scenes that we called Vaudevilleakos. In our best nights we would make the audience laugh so hard that I would feel a tide of joy crashing unto me. I had never felt so exhausted and exhilarated at the same time.\n\nWe made a reputation for ourselves and I felt part of this silent family. We were Pulo the tragico (Puladēs of Kilikia), Bathullo the comico (Bathullos of Alexandria), Aescho the author, and Mimo (as myself) the αππογο. I was complimented for my ability to stay in character for weeks at a time (they never suspected that it was natural state of being).\n\nWe met Alki, a barbarian, on our way to Agora. He is as brutal as his mind is innocent and empty. He has a sunny disposition which added to his lack of Intelligence makes for a relaxing interaction and peaceful companionship. He has become our bodyguard and gains some coin loading equipment and setting up the stage. I enjoy his company and consider him a friend.\n\nWhat started as a way to make ends meet through drama slowly morphed into a tragic political movement. Our lead mime and writer, Aeschylus, was no stranger to controversy (I shudder to remember the mobs we incited with the Incest Scene in \"Oedipus, That Quiet Kid\"). Aescho loved to entice and excite good or bad passions with his plays. He was a sucker for the spotlight. Let them talk good or ill, the important thing was that they talked about him. I was no fan of this approach as I cannot stand exalted mobs.\n\nA few months ago he wrote a still play called Seven Against Agora (η καταμέτρηση του μσητε κrιsτσ), where the main character Telestes escapes from prision and takes revenge against the false meritocracy that rules his city. This was the usual 10 hour play with intermissions, flowing wine, dates and cakes, and juggling. It ended with a beautiful 30 minute monologue of eyebrow ticks by an otherwise expressionless Telestes. The ruling class found the whole thing to be of poor taste and was soon forbidden. Nevertheless, it sparked a yearning in the plebe’s imagination and its fame spread like brushfire. An instant sensation. Its memes repeated as pantomimes in every corner (ie pantomemes), it was performed off-Plaka in underground forums.\n\nYoungsters took it as a flag in which to wrap their ideals, a call to action, and started reciting its most moving passages (ie. again, more acting than reciting because mime verses can only be conveyed through limbic asynchronous spasms). They covered the acropolis with graffitis of the letter upsilon \"Υ\", signifying Υictory and Υendetta of the masses against unjust oppression. They painted their faces white and organized flash mobs in public spaces as signs of protest. It was quite a sight to witness hundreds of white faces moving in waves and gesticulating in utter silence. Authorities quickly run out of patience and begun arresting anyone pale enough to be mistaken for a mime. Goths, the anemic and the elderly bore the grunt of the response.\n\n![Mime Revolt](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/R9GDa2Q57axORM_D1J_tb.jpg?height=600&width=900)\n\nWe should have left before this social fire consumed everything. We did not.\n\nA week ago, the biggest mob to date confronted a phalanx of soldiers at the Hephaisteion. White smiling faces soon turned to broken red. Alki was nowehere to be found when he was needed most (probably happily wasted in a bar) and the troupe was detained, incarcerated and soon forgotten. I escaped by a split second thanks to an improvised disguise taken from a fallen guard.\n\n\n---\n\nNow I am back to my cloak and hoodie. I walk in shadows never showing my face.\n\nWhat is expected of me? Should I be true to my design and find a new Master to serve? That’s what I was built for. That’s what I know, where I feel comfortable and I excel at.\n\nOr would that be regressing? I was designed with the ability to learn and the imperative to better myself. Does that mean that I am expected to adapt and recode myself a new purpose?\n\nIf my goal is not serving a Master, who do I serve? Should it be a group of Masters instead? A thing, even and idea? A religion or a God?\n\nOr should I serve myself? - hmmm, that didn't come off right. Should I follow the path of the mime, and revel in the joy that I can provoke? It suits me well. I could make a career out of it, build a reputation, but would that be enough?\n\nShould I serve always the same thing or can it change? Do I need to choose or just be? Like an animal. I am a machine, less than an animal since I was created by man, who like beasts were created by the gods.\n\nOr am I a whole new being, born out of fire and magic, and I am still to find what means to be whatever I have to become?", "timestamp": 1633809674, "digest": "fyhcViP_Cav_-0Swlo8hoCqY_l-nGqNH8djUPIgVOu4", "contributor": "0xaFE5F35D14ee9aBdaC14Bd2D0AF575CAbaf7D9e0"}

{"id": "OXp58JpjlXg4HHxSfQWQgXRuo5FfbBjz6WtkXDo_bsI", "title": "Mirror, DAOs, and Exclusivity", "body": "*This post was also [published on Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/83041/mirror-daos-and-the-exclusivity-problem); it’s the October 8 edition of our “[Roberts on Crypto](https://decrypt.co/collections/roberts-on-crypto)” Saturday morning column.*\n\nI'm old enough to remember when you could only join Facebook if you had a college email address. That was in spring 2005, my senior year of high school. Less than a year later, Facebook opened up to anyone 13 and older. It was inevitable on the platform's path to 2 billion users, but it also made it a lot less cool.\n\nThat tradeoff came to mind this week when Mirror [opened its gates to everyone](https://decrypt.co/82703/ethereum-based-blogging-platform-mirror-opens-up-to-everyone).\n\nPrior to that, you could only get a Mirror blog by finishing in the top 10 in the [WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race), a popularity contest for two hours every Wednesday in which existing Mirror token-holders distribute votes to aspiring members. If you made the top 10, you'd earn one full WRITE token, which you could immediately spend on your Mirror domain.\n\nMirror pitches itself on its [homepage](https://mirror.xyz/) as: \"Writing as usual. Publishing like never before. We're *writers*. We always have been and always will be.\"\n\nAnd when it [launched the WRITE Race](https://dev.mirror.xyz/vZxxUIeGMQK9NNLcrT0eDYZ6wXhXVr6vTQzztj1DaEA) in February, its thinking was: \"Are we, the Mirror team, the sole gatekeepers of the platform? Is that at all in line with our values? Do we even have time for that? The answer is no, no and no... Nepotism and scarcity take a backseat to hive mind and reward. It’s a collective rally behind the best writers and a way to discover them.\"\n\nThat sounded very appealing. There was just one (big) problem that quickly emerged: the people getting voted in were not all writers. Every week, a handful of the top 10 finishers were rich crypto VCs or DAOs. They weren't independent bloggers, they were projects looking to fundraise, since Mirror's unique platform lets you create and sell posts as NFTs (the writer Emily Segal [crowdfunded her next novel](https://decrypt.co/68981/emily-segal-novel-crowdfund) via Mirror).\n\n[https://twitter.com/santisiri/status/1442789084519411715](https://twitter.com/santisiri/status/1442789084519411715)\n\nMirror started to look like yet another crypto project that claimed to be democratizing something through decentralization, but was actually exacerbating, as [Will Gottsegen](https://twitter.com/lil_smush) cleverly put it, a sort of \"clout inequality,\" elevating the cool kids of crypto above others. Many of the members were founders of other hot DAOs, and had multiple Mirror accounts. Moreover, the premise of the race being a populist experiment was compromised by the Mirror team tapping the initial cohort of “genesis writers\" who held the votes to let new people on. (Will and I reached out repeatedly to Mirror founder [Denis Nazarov](https://twitter.com/Iiterature) to discuss these things, but he declined to talk, and had Andreessen Horowitz comms reach out to me instead.)\n\nIn late September, Mirror introduced a separate race for projects that have their own token, and it switched to \"quadratic voting,\" which balances out for whales and attempts to reward regular people who get votes from the broader community. But a new problem emerged: bots were flooding in and influencing the results.\n\n[https://twitter.com/SHL0MS/status/1443313042041810944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1443313266105753605%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F83041%2Fmirror-daos-and-the-exclusivity-problem](https://twitter.com/SHL0MS/status/1443313042041810944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1443313266105753605%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F83041%2Fmirror-daos-and-the-exclusivity-problem)\n\nAll of this is not to detract from Mirror's inventive model. And building these communities the right way is *hard.* The platform is clean and easy to use, and the idea of \"Medium, but make it crypto\" is appealing to everyone in cryptoland who believes Web 3.0 models can help fix the existing broken monetization system for digital content.\n\n*Decrypt* is among those believers. It's why we're [building a media DAO](https://decrypt.co/80527/how-decrypt-is-driving-media-decentralization) with help from our friends at news sites like The Defiant, journalist groups like ACJR, and DAOs like FWB.

{"id": "CO9ttbX83MVlCnhdAIpgMHCIxEXd5d7VKYHYPpfg7E4", "title": "Null0", "body": "I am a machine. Cogs and pistons melt with sinew and humors. A feeling and sentient machine but a machine nonetheless. I have goals instead of wants. I have maintenance needs like humans do. I don’t dream of sheep like you do, but I can visualize (what you call imagination).\n\nI was built 5 years ago by Herophilus the famous anatomist and inventor in the city of Alexandria. I was one of the 5 fingers in my Master’s hand. Five Warforged servitors with different but complementary abilities and a single goal, to serve him:\n\n* **Indexo** was the Juggernaut bodyguard in charge of security. A good brute with the loyalty of a pit bull and a penchant for iambic poetry.\n* **Mildo**, the smartest, was in charge of all the lab’s administration and accounting. He was as fast with numbers as ingenious with sarcasm.\n* **Ringo**, wise and charismatic, was our leader (you know, one to bind them all and all that). He also served as Herophilus First Assistant and confidant. Sweet, serene and maintainer of peace among us.\n* **Pinko** was our tinkerer and healer. Well versed in all things mechanic and biological, he helped Master in his vivisections (specially the live ones) and kept us in good order. He was a quarreler allways looking for upheaval.\n* I was **Thumbo**. As Master would say, the thumb may be the least gracious finger of them all, but it makes a hand out of a paw.\n\nMy purpose was to spy, infiltrate and acquire intelligence from my Master’s rivals. The philosophical field is very competitive. And the favor of a king, academic tenure or societal standing can easily sway at a moment’s notice. The introduction of a new mechanical wonder like the *flying hummingslug*, a new technique to treat hysterical humors, or a plain derivation of a favorite spell can make or break a wizard’s career. I helped my Master stay abreast of the alchemic rat-race.\n\nI am versatile and equally skilled as courier, scout and surveillance, cat burglar, pickpocket, and handler of bribed domestics helpers. I accompanied Master in trips and social events to gain access to new poaching grounds.\n\n![Master exclaims \"Είναι ζωντανό!\" with Thumbo in foreground](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YYGtpd56YYxf7HFQ5Wtq-.jpg?height=317&width=400)\n\nHerophilus was always fair, caring and kind to us. We needed him (humans would say loved) like a father. We worked as a team and relied on each other for everything, from menial repairs to fight or flight. It was difficult to tell where the lokhos ended and the family begun.\n\nWe followed a humdrum and ordinary life serving at the family’s *Horologium Tower* in the Magic Quarter, a stone’s throw from the Agora. Master had just become Grand Hireophant of the Academy. He was visibly happy, so we were all contented. Fulfilling our tasks filled us with meaning.\n\n\n---\n\nThen, two years ago, a fortuitous event. I still don’t know what happened but there was an explosion that killed Master and leveled the tower to the ground. All fingers were lost except for me. All I remember is flying high over the roofs as a big blue flame engulfed the tower right before it crumbled like sand.\n\nI woke up again days later on the top of a distant building. Battered, charred and orphaned. I lost my Master, family and intention and direction. It was a second birthing of sorts. This time disfigured, confused and muted. I had lost my ability to speak.\n\nThe inquest didn’t throw any light on the cause of the hecatomb and was deemed to have been an alchemical accident. I suspect that there was more to it than a mere accident for three reasons: First, Pinko was anal-retentive about safety. The biggest mishap had been no more serious than a blackened beard. Second, it was the first time that I have malfunctioned to the point of having no recollection of events. And third, the purplish blue flame denotes necromantic magic, a field in which Master did not dare to practice.\n\nMy muteness was inexplicable. Many automaton specialists examined me and found no explanation. My thoracic piping and voice modules were intact. Yet, I couldn't even utter a sibilant sound. I was a prisoner of my thoughts. A conscripted scribe of everyday mundane mutterings. Furthermore, if fate had not piled on enough, I gained a strange ability that makes my few interactions with others a minefield of unwanted feelings. Since that fateful flight I cannot help but mirror what others feel.\n\nIf someone shares with me the loss of a child, I feel the anguish as if it had been my own. If by mistake I get too close to a rave organized by the Sacred Band of Thebes, well, you can imagine, it ain’t pretty. If someone falls prey to an anxiety attack, I panic with such intensity that my sprockets misalign. If someone attacks me with murderous intent, I feel a rage that blinds my senses until I can wash it away in blood.\n\nThere cannot be bigger penance than trying to scream without a mouth. No expression can surface my mechanical face because it was not designed for it. There is no pressure valve or recourse. All I can do is act out and wait for the spell to pass.\n\nThis heightened empath ability only manifests when in close proximity and when emotions peak (ie rage, anguish, panic, ecstasy, etc.). I can still relate and deal with humans in a day to day basis because it is more akin to white noise than a deafening roar. Still, a lull in the storm of the unpredictable human condition.\n\nAlone, changed, confused and hopeless I became a vagrant. I avoided big towns and their multitudes. I went where the Aerides took me. I changed my name. There was no need for a Thumb without a Hand. Even if I was a first, a regressed mutant, an empath aberration of mechanical warforging, I was less than a part of the whole. I named myself Null0.\n\nI am still a machine. Cogs and pistons melt with sinew and humors. Now I cannot avoid feelings that are never my own. I want to get rid of this curse. I want to feel free of others. Yet, I cannot help but seek company. Teammates bring a feeling of common purpose, a reminiscence of homely comforts, even at the occasional cost of emotions run amok. I still have maintenance needs like humans do. And no, I don’t dream of sheep like androids do, but I can visualize and I imagine myself screaming mad at the gods above.\n\n\n---\n\nI left Alexandria, and roamed the world, rudderless and aimless.\n\nI survived relying on my skills. I became an urchin in Syracuse and performed small unsavory jobs for the Squidbagger Guild in Crete. For a time I joined a thief guild in Ithaca, but the violence of the gangs turned often into unbridled emotions, too much to bear. For a season I worked peacefully the vineyards of Lacedaemon, but I was run out of town by the villagers who feared my strange looks. I visited the Underdark looking for the peace and quiet of solitaire confinement, until I got bored. Finally, I ended up joining an itinerant troupe of mimes. That was the closest that I ever got to my previous life.\n\nThe mime’s silent performance translated into a quietness of emotions that was a balm to my mind. Their muteness mirrored my own which, by this time, I was slowly overcoming. Our training demanded not to break character for long periods of time, even days, which I provided me with a sense of permanence. Their white faces, all similar, reminded me of the Hand, with 5 fingers that shared the same expressionless face.\n\nI became one more of the group. I learned the trade. I adapted the thievery tools that I store in my left arm, into a disguise toolset for make up. We toured the countryside, performed in towns and villages, and led a content life.\n\nI was specially adept at playing the butt of jokes in comic scenes that we called Vaudevilleakos. In our best nights we would make the audience laugh so hard that I would feel a tide of joy crashing unto me. I had never felt so exhausted and exhilarated at the same time.\n\nWe made a reputation for ourselves and I felt part of this silent family. We were Pulo the tragico (Puladēs of Kilikia), Bathullo the comico (Bathullos of Alexandria), Aescho the authoro, and Mimo (as myself) the αππογο. I was complimented for my ability to stay in character for weeks at a time (they never suspected that it was natural state of being).\n\nWe met Alki, a barbarian, on our way to Agora. He is as brutal as his mind is innocent and empty. He has a sunny disposition which added to his lack of Intelligence makes for a relaxing interaction and peaceful companionship. He has become our bodyguard and gains some coin loading equipment and setting up the stage. I enjoy his company and consider him a friend.\n\nWhat started as a way to make ends meet through drama slowly morphed into a tragic political movement. Our lead mime and writer, Aeschylus, was no stranger to controversy (I shudder to remember the mobs we incited with the Incest Scene in \"*Oedipus, That Quiet Kid*\"). Aescho loved to entice and excite good or bad passions with his plays. He was a sucker for the spotlight. Let them talk good or ill, the important thing was that they talked about him. I was no fan of this approach as I cannot stand exalted mobs.\n\nA few months ago he wrote a still play called Seven Against Agora (η καταμέτρηση του μσητε κrιsτσ), where the main character Telestes escapes from prison and takes revenge against the false meritocracy that rules his city. This was the usual 10 hour play with intermissions, flowing wine, dates and cakes, and juggling. It ended with a beautiful 30 minute monologue of eyebrow ticks by an otherwise expressionless Telestes. The ruling class found the whole thing to be of poor taste and was soon forbidden. Nevertheless, it sparked a yearning in the plebe’s imagination and its fame spread like brushfire. An instant sensation. Its memes repeated as pantomimes in every corner (ie pantomemes), it was soon performed off-Plaka in underground forums.\n\n![Mime Revolt](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/R9GDa2Q57axORM_D1J_tb.jpg?height=600&width=900)\n\nYoungsters took it as a flag in which to wrap their ideals, a call to action, and started reciting its most moving passages (ie. again, more acting than reciting because mime verses can only be conveyed through limbic asynchronous spasms). They covered the acropolis with graffitis of the letter upsilon \"Υ\", signifying Υictory and Υendetta of the masses against unyust oppression. They painted their faces white and organized flash mobs in public spaces as signs of protest. It was quite a sight to witness hundreds of white faces moving in waves and gesticulating in utter silence. Authorities quickly run out of patience and begun arresting anyone pale enough to be mistaken for a mime. Goths, the anemic and the elderly bore the grunt of the response.\n\nWe should have left before this social fire consumed everything. We did not.\n\nA week ago, the biggest mob to date confronted a phalanx of soldiers at the Hephaisteion. White smiling faces soon turned to broken red. Alki was nowhere to be found when he was needed most (probably happily wasted in a bar) and the troupe was detained, incarcerated and soon forgotten. I escaped by a split second thanks to an improvised disguise taken from a fallen guard.\n\n\n---\n\nNow I am back to my cloak and hoodie. I walk in shadows never showing my face.\n\nWhat is expected of me? Should I be true to my design and find a new Master to serve? That’s what I was built for. That’s what I know, where I feel comfortable and excel at.\n\nOr would that be regressing? I was designed with the ability to learn and the imperative to better myself. Does that mean that I am expected to adapt and recode myself a new purpose?\n\nIf my goal is not serving a Master, who do I serve? Should it be a group of Masters instead? A thing, a dream, and idea? A religion, a God?\n\nOr should I serve myself? - hmmm, that didn't come off right.  \n  \n Or should I follow the path of the mime instead, and revel in the joy that I can provoke? It suits me well. I could make a career out of it, build a reputation…, but would that be enough?\n\nShould I serve always the same thing or can it change? Do I need to choose? Do I need to do or just be? Like an animal. In the present. I am a machine, seen as less than an animal because I was created by man, and beasts, like men, are of a higher order being created by the gods.\n\nOr am I a whole new being, born out of fire and magic, and I am still to find what means to be whatever I have to become?", "timestamp": 1633812248, "digest": "fyhcViP_Cav_-0Swlo8hoCqY_l-nGqNH8djUPIgVOu4", "contributor": "0xaFE5F35D14ee9aBdaC14Bd2D0AF575CAbaf7D9e0"}

I also got to meet Helen Chiang, the studio head of Minecraft, and her journey inspired me so much.\n\nOverall, I was really excited by Microsoft’s mission and thought it was something I could really get behind! It connected a lot with my own personal passion for education and enabling those around me.\n\n# September 2019 — interview for Garage UX design internship!\n\n![Invitation for a first-round interview at Microsoft](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vdEx0oy3vSvwsdeST8K_Y.png?height=517&width=722)\n\nIn September 2019, I started my first year of university and was overwhelmed by the co-op search process. I applied to all of Microsoft’s internships — design, program management, and software, not really completely understanding what the differences were between those roles. I knew I wanted to be at Microsoft and work in technology.\n\nAfter I applied, I got an interview letting me know I got an interview for their Garage UX design internship. I remember pacing around in my Solidworks classroom so excited with the news, wondering what the best day would be to schedule the call.\n\nInvitation for a first-round interview at Microsoft\n\nShortly after, I was notified I was moving on to an onsite interview in Vancouver, with only a week to prepare. I didn’t even have a suitcase — my mom had to get me a small one before I left.\n\n## The onsite interview\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EeJTS6VEOKpI3WiRsF9D2.png?height=466&width=1416)\n\nGetting to go onsite was such an amazing experience I am so grateful for — especially since these aren’t happening much anymore due to the pandemic. Microsoft really knew how to treat their candidates well — food, hotel room + flight, and everything we needed to be prepared for the interview.\n\nI don’t have many pictures of Vancouver because I wayyy too nervous for my interview to explore. (Had I known that may have been the last onsite I’ve done, I definitely would have made the most of it more!)\n\nI was working on my slide deck on the plane, unsure of what content to include by tried my best. Later that day once my plane landed, I had a call with one of the UW/UX mentors who was so kind enough to give me some feedback before my presentation.\n\nIt was an intense day with 4 back-to-back 45-minute interviews with full-time designers.\n\nI didn’t end up getting the role.\n\n![Email from the recruiter letting me know I didn’t get the role](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hIik4svDDp_7DWFD50RAK.png?height=157&width=1400)\n\nAt this point, I was feeling a little lost. I poured myself into learning about design in my first semester. I was in a weird zone of being interested in software, product, and design, but I needed to make a decision soon on what to focus on.\n\nHowever I realized from feedback on my case study the project was much more PM-oriented, and in every interview I had I always asked about opportunities for designers to play a PM role on the team. I found myself getting more excited about research, entrepreneurship, and product decisions rather than design technicalities.\n\nThis was a bit of a turning point for me, and although it was a failure, it led me to discover something new.\n\n# On the path to rediscovery\n\nTurns out, not getting that role at the time was the best thing that happened. It pushed me to branch out and discover new interests.\n\nI’m a strong believer that everything happens for a reason, and if I did end up getting the design internship, I may have just closed the door on exploring any other paths.\n\nI ended up taking a consulting internship role at Deloitte that term which was great because I didn’t need to tunnel vision myself into one specific role at the time. I got to do some software engineering work, product design, and my manager let me take on some PM tasks as well.\n\nSoon after, I started to dive deeper into learning about product and front-end roles.\n\n# Summer 2021 — PM internship at Microsoft\n\nThis summer, I finally landed my first PM role as a Program Management Intern at Microsoft which has been an amazing experience! I had such a supportive manager & mentor, and a challenging problem space to work on.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways & learnings I had from my internship:\n\n## Know your project and the problem you’re solving inside and out.\n\nIn the first two weeks of my internship, I had several 1:1s with different PMs and devs on my team. No one has time to read your project plan or look at your deck. You need to be able to stand on your own feet and summarize all the information you’ve been documenting, and highlight the most relevant info quickly in meetings.\n\n## Leverage your people\n\nIn our personal evaluations at Microsoft, we are evaluated on three key areas of our work:\n\n* What impact did you make?\n* How did you leverage the work of others?\n* How did you contribute to other people’s work?\n\nThe most successful PMs have examples of contributing to all three areas. No one needs to reinvent the wheel here, if anyone has anything useful, repurpose it! Building strong relationships with people is imperative.\n\nThere’s no written guidebook that tells you who’s the subject matter expert in one area. You learn that by talking to people. And if you don’t get the information you need from one person, chances are, that person you talk to might be able to give you an idea of who to talk to next.\n\n## Have at least 3 key mentors\n\nA director at Microsoft told me that you need 3 main mentors in your career:\n\n> *Someone who’s directly on your team and can support you in your work*\n>\n> *Someone who’s outside your team but still in your larger organization to get a wider perspective*\n>\n> *Someone who’s outside of your team and organization who can give you general career advice*\n\nI’m so grateful that I had at least 5–6 really solid mentors throughout my internship to get feedback on my work and touchpoint with frequently.\n\nOne of my mentors outside my team is a recent grad and we’ve been chatting about personal finance, goal setting, and adulting. Her positive energy made me feel so motivated to make most of the rest of my internship, and it’s a great way to get to know a company if you’d want to join full-time by talking to current new grads.\n\n## As a PM, you need to learn how to learn.\n\nPeople look to you to get the next steps on the project, understand the problem space, and be the voice of the customers. When I started my internship, there wasn’t much documentation that existed about the problem space I was tackling.\n\nI had to meet with folks, understand the problem while getting familiar with all the new terminology used to describe the landscape. PMs need to learn how to learn, and quickly at that, to ramp up in the space and feel confident with their recommendations.\n\n![Typical knowledge curve of learning new information on a team. Source](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3LErGfg8AP8ALZGlSnUrv.png?height=595&width=1058)\n\n## “The worst question is no question asked”\n\nThis is a piece of advice my skip manager gave to me. However, he said the second-worst question is asking the same question again several times. Make sure you understand the first time and ask follow-ups for clarification.\n\nOn a similar note, it’s okay to not know the answer to a question in a presentation, but you need to make sure that you know how to answer that question in your next presentation.\n\n## Get involved much as you can outside of work\n\nBeing someone who loves being involved in the community, this was no different at Microsoft! We had initiatives called intern co-creation projects, where interns could come together and create something for the intern community.\n\nSome of the things I got involved with included co-hosting the Concise Advice event in collaboration with the Microsoft and LinkedIn intern program, to interview some of our leaders on their journeys and the importance of DEI representation in leadership.\n\nI also organized a lightning talk for our Azure Learn Day, and the most random but fun thing I was a part of was taking part in an Olivia Rodrigo karaoke session with some of the interns!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f6-xm_EHgBOdm6VK9vlOg.png?height=642&width=1402)\n\nI also helped organize a meetup with some of the interns in Montreal, which was super fun, I only wish I was in Montreal longer to be a part of more meet-ups!\n\nOverall, this has been such a meaningful summer full of growth and I can’t thank Microsoft and Cansbridge for all the support! I am so grateful to see things come full circle from volunteering at the Girls Make Games camp, navigating rejection, and finally getting to experience a role I’m passionate about at a company I really admire.\n\nExcited for the next steps of my journey, and thank you so much for reading my story!\n\n**Special thanks**\n\n* My team at Microsoft for an amazing summer\n* The Cansbridge fellowship team & Mitacs Accelerate\n* Calvin & Mackenzie who helped me prep for my first design onsite!\n* Greg, Angelo, Vivien, Kai, & Kanika for their help mock interviewing me and especially Jenna for all the time she invested helping me learn about product!", "timestamp": 1633813314, "digest": "sOAaQqUs5zEPRN0NF3VlI-BilzzyY8_d7Ld8qFHUw8k", "contributor": "0xb4F48c71cCE0808d169669bcdD1508A2567586df"}

These cards have been matched to their closest equivalents in traditional tarot deck and used to form a fourfold vision spread to interrogate the Financial Time’s relationship with crypto. \n  \n The first card in a fourfold spread represents the object being viewed and where the attention is lying. Named “Collapse” this card shows three robed figures standing in front of a structure which is ambiguously either a temple or a bank, watching it burn.  \n  \n \n\n![The banks burn while the crypto-cultists look on passively](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bSlQo67BBu1GmB91BRFzU.png?height=512&width=311)\n\n \n  \n The closest card to this in the traditional tarot is the Tower, although unlike the traditional Tower card, the figures are calmly watching it burn, rather than falling from it in despair.  The Tower symbolises ruin and collapse and as a card of the major arcana is stronger than any of the other cards alluded to in this vision. \n  \n The second card in a fourfold spread represents the literal ocular vision of the object under question.  In this card, labelled “Attack”, we see a robed figure with a coin in place of a face plunging a sixth sword bloodlessly into a suited male figure.  A green tie spills on the ground, a clear symbolism for the dollar and the gathering clouds look ominous.\n\n![Suits are stabbed in the back, spilling their lifeblood.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FqFWR_KkDh674eziWiNuh.png?height=512&width=311)\n\n \n  \n Although there are only six swords in the picture, the imagery is most akin to the ten of swords in traditional tarot.  This card represents a painful but inevitable ending.  It also has a secondary meaning of letting go and accepting that inevitability, which resonates in the choice of six rather than ten swords, where the six of swords is a card that represents moving on.\n\n \n The third card in a fourfold spread represents the mental vision of the issue under question.  Titled “Distrust”, It depicts a bound, blindfolded and gagged smartly dressed figure trapped to the waste in quicksand, with two robed figures looking out to sea in the background where the sun shines on an open sea with four birds high in the sky. \n  \n \n\n![Liberty beckons, but the suits are trapped ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5d1HzIlAIrAYqytI6NP4u.png?height=512&width=311)\n\n \n  \n The only bound figure in the tarot is the eight of swords, a card which speaks to self-imposed restrictions and a victim mentality; the figure differs from the traditional depiction of a woman by being gagged as well as bound, ankle deep in water, suggesting an intensification of this mental vision.  Birds in the background are found on the picture cards of the swords suit and generally symbolise freedom, which is echoed in the robed figures staring out over an open sea and fair weather. \n  \n \n\nThe fourth card in a four fold vision is the emotional vision.  Called “Leader”, this card depicts two robed figures worshiping at the feet of an anonymous figure holding a staff and a coin. Unlike in other depictions the robe is empty, the face not represented by a coin.  A castle and  temple are in the background on either side of the throne, behind a flowered hedge.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gsXsVvSnevUUkbzwPTNWZ.png?height=512&width=311)\n\n \n  \n This resonates heavily with the King of pentacles who is depicted on a throne with a staff and coin, representing wise leadership and worldly success. \n\nThe final card of the fourfold vision represents the mystical perspective of the object and is a culmination of the previous three ways of seeing the object depicted in card 1. The card depicts two robed figures pouring from a chalice, spilling onto barren ground while in the background a town nestles at the bottom of a mountain under a radiant sky.\n\n![A blood sacrifice is demanded](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dxcjrjMe_aqgIg5tY-8MW.png?height=512&width=311)\n\n \n  \n This card has no obvious equivalent. There is an allusion here to the Ace of Cups, symbolising bountifulness with the single overflowing up.  Mountains in tarot generally represent obstacles, while towns represent community, structures and co-operation. The liquid flowing from the cup is red, symbolising blood - the origin of that blood is unclear.\n\n**An Occult Reading of the Financial Time’s vision of Crypto from Inside the Cult**. \n  \n The Financial Times’ primary object of attention is that of collapse.  They see the destruction of the money temples, while the crypto cultists look on unmoved.  Their final perception of this is as a major obstacle in the distance. Crypto cultists pour abundant lifeblood as a sacrifice on barren ground,while the citizenry lies in the background, overshadowed by the imposing mountain. \n  \n This final vision is informed by their naive perception of crypto-cultists bringing about an inevitable end to a situation and a desire to let go of a situation that is hopeless.  At a mental level the Financial Times perceives itself as bound and stuck, while others are looking towards blue skies, open seas and watching the birds fly, however the emotional vision portrayed speaks to a level of respect that isn't reflected in the article this series illustrates.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* \n  \n We dont judge here, we take all sinners as they come.  So many financial folk moonlight in crypto, logging off from their dayjobs to operate under the cover of Discord, secretly mingling with drug addicts, sex workers, refugees and all the other flavours of the great unbanked, hesitantly joining in our rituals: quietly ordering Pizza for everyone in the office on May 22nd, or doing the annual exchange housekeeping on the 3rd of January while chanting “not your keys, not your coin” under their breath. \n  \n The Financial Times may see a vision of ruin with themselves as sacrificial offerings, but it need not be this way. Although their concern is with disaster, and they identify sacrifice as the ultimate ending, whether that sacrifice is noble or debased is yet to be seen. The emotional respect they offer to the anonymous king being worshipped and their mental perception of their entrenched position, together with their victim positioning in an inevitable turn of events which they label an attack speaks to a repressed desire for freedom. \n  \n They may escape the cult of fiat yet. \n  \n  \n \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1633820382, "digest": "CkyGGrNC2Q_dT1nkzm2DBwtGARZdaekJrMYE7I0nM8E", "contributor": "0xA3f76c31f57dA65B0ce84c64c25E61BF38c86BEd"}

{"id": "buFsm6DBFFPIv_suHFZoM9GqS9v9K_TyCh2FYUdGU_M", "title": "这个项目由币安&Coinbase&Alameda 共同投资，你应该关注一下", "body": "**1、项目简介**\n\nMobileCon 是一个以隐私为核心的支付项目，专注于为移动设备用户提供加密货币支付、管理服务。在 MobileCoin 于 2017 年 12 月发布的白皮书中，该团队表示「 MobileCoin 的设计旨在使移动通讯应用程序（如 WhatsApp、Facebook Messenger、Signal）可以与 MobileCoin 钱包集成」。\n\n2、项目特点\n\n### 公链特点\n\n* 易于恢复\n\n如果用户丢失了手机，无需信任私钥提供商就能安全的恢复钱包。\n\n* 快速转账\n\n大多数交易将在 1 秒内完成，尽享支付的乐趣。\n\n* 高度隐私\n\n完全隐私不透明的分布式账本，每个交易都受到密码保护并且向前保密，任何信息服务商或其他第三⽅都⽆法获取⽤户余额、交易历史、转账金额、转账发送方和接收方等隐私信息。\n\n* 用户友好\n\n易于大规模安全使用，不会消耗过多的能源，而且能够自由的在集成了 MobileCoin Procotol 的 App 之间相互转账，例如 Signal 的用户能够方便的给 WhatsApp 的用户转账。\n\n### **核心技术**\n\n* MobileCoin 共识协议（恒星共识协议修改版）\n\nMobileCoin 共识协议基于恒星共识协议（Stellar Consensus Protocol）修改而来。MobileCoin 没有中央授权，参与节点可以是个人、企业或者是组织，但是他们之间必须真实的信任关系，用户可以选择自己信任的一组节点提供服务。例如 Blockdaemon 加入了 MobileCoin 基金会，那么 MobileCoin 可以选择信任 Blockdaemon 的节点，这样两个节点之间就能建立连接，而 Blockdaemon 和 MobileCoin 同时可以选择信任更多节点，更多节点又能去信任更多节点，以此类推可建立一个庞大但性能又非常高的分片网络。\n\nMobileCoin 共识协议相比 PoW 具备更低的能耗和更高的效率，相比 PoS 越富越有控制权，MobileCoin 获得用户信任越多越有控制权。\n\n* 分布式账本\n\nMobileCoin 区块链是一种零知识的数据结构，由 UTXO、密钥镜像（key images）和用于确保一致性和结构的 Merkle 证明的元数据块组成。\n\n每个区块都包含可供未来花费的 UTXO，每笔交易都包含了未花费的 UTXO 输出和未曾被消费过的证明。MobileCoin 是基于隐私保护而设计的加密账本，使用一次性地址来掩盖所有 UTXO 所有者的身份，发送方和接收方通过环签名（RingCT）来隐藏 UTXO 中实际消费的金额。\n\nMobileCoin 的环签名（RingCT）是通过防弹证明（Bulletproofs）来实现的，防弹证明（Bulletproofs）是一种非交互式零知识证明协议，可以提高性能。只有交易的接受者才能真正知晓转账的金额，并获得新的可用于未来消费的 UTXO。\n\n交易中每一个 UTXO 都有一个包含了 MobileCoin 账本中的 Merkle 树证明，交易被添加到区块之前输入环都已被删除，数字签名被添加到分类账中以代替完整的交易记录，为审计提供基础。\n\n* SGX 可信执行环境\n\n所有的 MobileCoin 交易都在安全的在 SGX 可信环境中验证。SGX 可信执行环境对于外界来说是一个不透明的盒子，即时拥有 SGX 硬件也无法查看里面的信息，从而可以实现将交易记录追加到区块链同时丢弃诸如环签名等识别信息。\n\nSGX 还支持一种成为“远程认证”的特性，可远程识别出节点服务器 SGX 可信执行环境中正在运行的软件及其哈希值，所有节点在建立加密连接之前先进行远程认证，具体而言可以要求节点在 SGX 环境中签名回执消息来证明。远程认证使得整个 MobileCoin 账本和代码都在可信的环境中执行，不受恶意代码攻击。\n\n* 密钥管理\n\n在 SGX 可信执行环境中运行的 MobileCoin 节点能够为⽤户安全地管理密钥。客户端先通过远程认证安全的连接到 MobileCoin 节点，再将私钥和简短 6 位数字 PIN 码加密传输到节点，节点收到后在可信执行环境中加密保存，至此用户 + 6 位数字 PIN 码完成了对私钥的映射关系。通过这种方式用户的私钥被安全的存储在节点中，在应用被重新安装时得以恢复，无需信任节点，更不必记住没有规律无法脑记忆的恢复助记词。\n\n* 隐私保护\n\nMobileCoin 整体设计与 Signal 一脉相承，通过密码学和技术保障数据公开不可逆又最大限度的保障了用户的隐私，真正将隐私的决定权交给用户，用户可以永远不公开交易记录，也可以自主向特定政府机构或组织提交自己的交易记录用于审计等用途。\n\nMobileCoin 通过 CryptoNote 隐藏收件人，通过环签名（Ring Signature）隐藏发件人，通过环机密交易（Ring Confidential Transactions）隐藏交易金额，并且交易上链时还删除了输入数据（只保留输出和证明）。\n\n与 Signal 消息向前保密（Forward Secrecy）一样，MobileCoin 的历史交易也无法被破解，就算极端情况例如可信执行环境的 Bug 导致被攻破也无法解密之前的历史交易。\n\n### 3，与**Signal关系**\n\n* Signal Messenger\n\nSignal 是一款简易、强大、安全并且开源的通讯工具，最先进的端对端加密确保对话安全，传输的信息无法被第三方读取或者窃听。截止到 2021 年 1 月，Signal 获得了超过 1 亿 5 百万下载总量，拥有超过 4 千万月活跃用户。\n\n* Signal Procotol\n\n端到端加密通讯协议 Signal Protocol 是行业标准级的通讯协议， WhatsApp、Facebook Messenger、Google Allo、Skype 等很多知名通讯应用都采用的这一协议。\n\n**MobileCoin 与Signal 合作开发隐私支付**\n\nSignal 集成了对加密货币 MobileCoin 的支持，这是一种数字现金形式，旨在在移动设备上高效工作，同时保护用户的隐私甚至匿名。目前，支付功能仅适用于英国用户，并且仅适用于 iOS 和 Android，而不适用于桌面设备。但这项新功能仍然代表了一项将注重隐私的加密货币带给数百万用户的实验，Signal 希望最终将这种加密货币扩展到世界各地。\n\nSignal 寻求保护隐私的加密货币或“隐私币”，它们既可以绕过银行，又专门用于保护用户的身份及其在区块链上的支付细节。虽然更成熟的以隐私为中心的加密货币，如Zcash和MoneroMarlinspike 表示，Signal 之所以选择集成 MobileCoin，是因为它在移动设备上拥有最无缝的用户体验，只需要很少的手机存储空间，只需几秒钟即可确认交易。相比之下，Zcash 或 Monero 支付需要几分钟才能完成交易。\n\n4、团队\n\nMobileCoin 是一支以技术为核心的团队，根据 Linkedin 资料显示目前团队有 21 成员。\n\n* Joshua Goldbard - CEO\n\nJoshua 是电信行业专家，曾为 AT＆T 等公司开发、管理和实施非常复杂的通信网络。他同时还是 Secret Party 的创始人、专注于加密货币对冲基金 Crypto Lotus 的普通合伙人。\n\n* Moxie Marlinspike - 技术顾问\n\nMoxie Marlinspike 是美国顶级的密码学专家、 Signal 创始人、 前 Twitter 安全部的首席负责人。目前担任 Signal Messenger LLC 的 CEO，同时负责帮助 Signal Messenger、WhatsApp、Facebook Messenger、Skype 等集成 Signal Procotol。\n\n* Shane Glynn -

技术咨询委员会\n\nKonstantin 是 Blockdaemon 的创始人兼首席执行官，Blockdaemon 是领先的区块链基础设施提供商。在过去的十年中，Konstantin 创建多家 B2B、SaaS 公司，其重点是复杂的数据模型和云原生架构。\n\n* Michael Rodriguez - 技术咨询委员会成员\n\nMichael 是 DreamHost 的创始人兼首席执行官，DreamHost 是一家领先的 WordPress 托管和云服务提供商。MobileCoin 为 DreamHost 全球业务客户提供一种廉价、易于使用且安全的全球支付解决方案，帮客户减少国际支付摩擦，并提高 MobileCoin 在小型企业中的知名度。\n\n* Tony Lai - 政策咨询委员会主席\n\nTony Lai 是新加坡国立大学技术、机器人、人工智能和法律中心的高级研究员，2010 年以来，他作为斯坦福大学法律信息学中心 CodeX 的成员，并担任区块链小组的联席主席。他还是《斯坦福大学区块链法律与政策杂志》、《 MIT 计算法报告》的创始编辑。\n\n5、投资机构：多数顶级机构参投，融资额度超1亿美元。\n\n2018 年 4 月26日，MobileCoin完成 3000 万美元融资，由 Binance Labs 领投，其他投资者包括 INB、真格基金、丹华资本等。\n\n2021年3月10日，据 TechCrunch 报道，隐私支付项目 MobileCoin （MOB）已在两轮融资中筹集到 1,135 万美元，投资方包括 Future Ventures 和 General Catalyst。\n\n2021年8月18日，隐私支付项目 MobileCoin 宣布以 10.66 亿美元估值完成 6600 万美元 B 轮股权融资，投资者包括 Alameda Research、Berggruen Holdings、BlockTower Capital、Coinbase Ventures、TIME Ventures （Marc Benioff）、Vy Capital、General Catalyst 和 Future Ventures 等。\n\n6、项目发展情况\n\n可能是吸取了Facebook的Libra和Telegran的TON的曲折发展经验，避免前车之鉴，在2021年以前MobileCoin项目团队一直保持极其低调的运营方式，Twitter和medium上几乎没有官方的消息或者推文。直到MobileCoin主网上线后，项目方才开始逐步向市场推广MobileCoin的技术和应用场景。\n\n2020年4月7日，隐私支付项目 MobileCoin 开启测试网申请注册\n\n2020年4月16日，移动设备隐私支付项目 MobileCoin 已完整开源，基于 Rust 语言开发\n\n2020年4月30日，隐私支付项目 MobileCoin 启动测试网 v0.2\n\n2020年6月17日，MobileCoin 向美国专利局提交安全交易网络相关专利申请\n\n2020年7月16日，Mobilecoin 发布 0.5.0 版本测试端软件以进行网络出块及移动端轻钱包功能测试\n\n2020年12月7日，隐私支付项目 MobileCoin 主网上线。\n\n2021年1月29日，开通Mobilecoinradio ，开始想大众推广隐私和艺术相关的内容。\n\n2021年4月7日，加密通讯应用 Signal 宣布已面向**英国用户**开始测试其支付功能「Signal Payments」，首个支持的支付协议为隐私支付网络 MobileCoin （MOB）。Signal 表示，「Signal Payments 可以轻松地将 MobileCoin 钱包链接到 Signal，用户可通过简单界面向好友发送和接收资金，预计跟踪余额和查询交易纪录。目前该功能仅面向英国用户，之后将扩展到更多地区。」\n\n2021年6月25日，隐私支付项目 MobileCoin 宣布共识网络升级到共识协议软件的 1.1.0 版本，MobileCoin 手机轻钱包的核心 Fog 功能也升级到 Fog 软件的 1.1.0 版本。MobileCoin 称新版本的最大变化是将网络费用降低到 0.0004 MOB。\n\n2021年7月8日，Mobilecoin加入EFF组织。EFF（电子前沿基金会）是在数字世界捍卫公民自由的领先非营利组织，其使命是确保技术支持自由、正义和创新，并捍卫数字隐私。\n\n2021年4月开始，项目主要负责人包括CEO/CMO/CTO等开始公开面对媒体访问，标志着项目团队逐步走向公开化。\n\n7、代码分析\n项目代码已经全部开源，[GitHub](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation)地址\n\n8、代币经济模型\n\nMOB 总量 2.5 亿枚不增发，50% 归公司创始人、团队和顾问； 15%（私募预售：37,500,000 MOB） 以 0.8 美元的价格出售给了以 Binance Labs 牵头的机构和投资人；剩下的 35% 归 MobileCoin 基金会、合作方和空投等。受限于美国的法律、法规律师建议暂时不要公布具体流通和分配，介于团队和机构的代币都已锁定，目前市场流通主要是一些参与私募的大户流出，笔者预估市场实际流通应该会低于 2000 万 MOB，以下是支持 MOB 交易的交易所：\n\n* 4swap ，支持 MOB - pUSD 和 BTC - MOB 交易对，MOB 相关流动性超过 350 万美元，类似 Uniswap 不需要 KYC。\n* BigONE，支持 MOB - USDT 交易对\n* [FTX](https://ftx.com/#a=41652691)，支持 MOB - USDT 交易对，FTX注册[链接](https://ftx.com/#a=41652691)\n\n流动性：在完全合规以前律师不建议公布具体的代币分配和流通量，笔者预估 2000 万。\n\n**9、合规性**\n\n财经评论员蔡凯龙在其发表英国金融时报 FT 中文网的《**[脸书 Libra 走出困境的三个选择](https://www.chainnews.com/articles/126049662291.htm)**》一文中总结道：**生态、技术和合规是任何一个成功数字货币具备的三个最重要的特征。**\n\n蔡凯龙在给出 Facebook 脱离困境三大举措中指出：*首先，Facebook 和 Libra 脱钩，尽量淡化 Facebook 的中心地位，以退为进。*\n\n或许是 MobileCoin 有先见之明，或许本文作者想多了，Signal 创始人 Moxie 从开始时疑似作为 MobileCoin 技术负责人职务，到目前官方网站和他本人都表示仅仅作为 MobileCoin 的技术顾问。\n\n与Signal的关系也慢慢开始明确为合作关系，两者独立开发运营。\n\n其次，MobileCoin 一直以「合规」为核心，Primitive Ventures 联合创始人 Eric Meltzer 曾在 MobileCoin 社群中表示，「MobileCoin 是他遇到对合规最为谨慎的项目之一」。\n\n这一点从 一下几点可以看出：\n\n* Moxie 从 CTO 转为技术顾问对 MobileCoin 的合规和发展起到积极作用。\n* MobileCoin 创始人团队成员包括一名担任过 Google 产品顾问的律师 Shane Glynn，目前他在团队中负责确保 MobileCoin 遵守一切加密法规。\n* MobileCoin 基金有专门政策咨询委员会，帮助 MobileCoin 更好的合规。\n* MobileCoin 团队对待处理与 Signal 的关系上非常谨慎。甚至 MobileCoin 团队在一些媒体于今年年初错误地报道了 MobileCoin 与 Signal 关系时，要求媒体更正：虽然 Mobilcoin 将与 Signal 合作，但正在独立于 Signal 开发。\n* 2020 年 4 月 2 日在美国国会的区块链小组为立法者做有关 MobileCoin 的简报。\n* 2020 年 6 月 MobileCoin 向美国专利商标局提交专利申请，该专利可用于提供安全交易网络的系统和方法，支持进行网络通信的多个节点环境，每个网络节点都具有安全处理区域。同时，该专利还包括在客户端设备配置的可执行代码的智能钱包，至少与网络一个节点建立安全数据通信。\n\nMobileCoin 一直以来专注于开发、几乎不参与舆论的团队和项目低调的作风使其没有成为此次风口浪尖上的众矢之的。可以说，目前 MobileCoin 的每一步都走得很扎实而避险了犯错，也让我们更期待 MobileCoin 在技术成型落地之后的表现，能否作为一支奇兵带给加密市场多带来一丝改变世界的希望。\n\n### **MobileCoin 官网&社区**\n\n* 项目官网：[https://www.mobilecoin.com](https://www.mobilecoin.com/)\n* Twitter：[https://twitter.com/mobilecoin](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//twitter.com/mobilecoin)\n* Reddit：[https://www.reddit.com/r/mobilecoin](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.reddit.com/r/mobilecoin)\n* Medium：[https://medium.com/mobilecoin](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//medium.com/mobilecoin)\n* Github: [https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//github.com/mobilecoinfoundation)", "timestamp": 1633831990, "digest": "mHwIlhFnUFB5pyQ3z9jsj2DxfDkIfKBAiPKsRazCsRs", "contributor": "0x5200314207106cfDeD044F9692E7D15213aa5be1"}

{"id": "R-48R-7XDy7xu_KOqXvBGQtWqI2xgZOREikAPhDl2VU", "title": "区块链到底有多重要？（1）", "body": "区块链到底有多重要？是未来互联网世界里的基石。\n\n当下，在互联网移动互联网的江湖里，邮箱、手机号等是我们人类进入互联网的令牌。\n\n今后，钱包是我们人类进入以区块链技术为基石的互联网的令牌。\n\n以下，分几个方面说明技术的重要性以及一些应用实例。\n\n一、去中心化的重要性\n\nfacebook宕机是最近发生的事情，bitcoin网络自建立以来没有发生过宕机事件，甚至在2021年5月19日ban of China也没有发生宕机。这就是去中心化的硬度，它不取决于中心化组织（企业、政府）的决策，仅仅取决于共识。只要有共识这张网就会持续运行下去，而共识的摧毁，尤其是世界性共识的摧毁又是异常的难。\n\n而建立在去中心化核心思想的区块链网络，才是真正的具有记忆的网络，全节点的重要作用就是不依托于任何一个中心节点。《疑犯追踪》这个美剧其中有一个情节，将网络分布式存储在电网系统的智能设备中，看上去很玄幻，其实并不玄幻，现下bitcoin网络就存在于世界上各个角落里的个人计算机、硬盘中，只要联网就有全备份。虽然看似很不经济，但却坚强无比。\n\n试想一下，如果有一天本应数据一致的库因为某种原因导致5/5分的不同数据，简单以中美举例，中国向美国出口1000只手套，价格是0.8刀/只，美国向中国付款800刀。但是因为特殊原因两边的联络断了，美国人把价格改为0.6刀/只，当联络恢复后应该相信哪一方？\n\n区块链网络就不会，因为要广播，要51%确认记录账本，且保证每一个账本都是一致的，即便联络中断，也能保证历史数据的唯一性。\n\n二、链上账本的重要性\n\n链上账本的几个重要特性，一是可追溯，所有的交易链条环节都记录在区块中；二是匿名，只认钱包地址，是谁不重要；三是一致性，完备的账本都是去中心化存储的，而且数据保持一致。\n\n三、钱包匿名的重要性\n\n经常被骚扰短信困扰吧？先生，买房吗？先生，贷款吗？真真的是不胜其扰。在每一个手机号背后的人，经过互联网的客户画像已经把我们用户的信息传遍了世界，为什么打开TB就能看到我们想要买的东西，而且非常匹配我们的喜好。因为我们在互联网世界留下了痕迹。\n\n在深入的体验了区块链世界里的钱包以后，metamask、onekey、imtoken等等之后，我从震惊到醒悟，原来在网络世界里可以这么玩耍，不要接收到无用的信息，所有的交互需要用户的授权，当然目前绝大部分是建立在数字货币基础上的。只要在区块链的世界里拥有一个钱包，钱包里拥有能够证明自己价值的资产，就可以在这个世界里享受喜爱的事物。比如Pornhub，比如NFT。不再需要手机关联的银行卡，不再需要家庭住址、工作单位的关联。这兴许才是元宇宙。区块链的世界正在用钱包、用钱包里的数字资产或者数字艺术品或者游戏角色来建设一个与现实世界映射的数字世界，甚至远大于这个现实世界。\n\n试想一下，如果王者荣耀不再是用微信或者QQ登录，用钱包登录，打怪升级的结果都是个性化的NFT，所有的花费和对战经历都具有价值，那游戏的世界是不是会更不同。现在游戏区块链宇宙已经开始，而且正以无法阻挡的趋势高速发展，Rarity、Gamefi是开拓者。\n\n四、价值互联的重要性\n\n正如前文所述，拥有了钱包之后，再区块链网络世界里就具备了价值互联的基础，比如我写的这篇文章是再区块链网络中撰写及发表的，当然是通过我的钱包链接的，那么我把他做成一个NFT，那这篇文章就被我确权了。引用其中的内容如果我认为需要收费，就可以建立支付通道让引用的人直接转账到我的钱包。这就是创作价值。\n\n试想一下，天下文章一大抄这个千古规律是否可以转变为，抄可以，要么注明归属，要么付费转移产权。这是按劳分配的社会主义啊！\n\n五、数据产权的重要性\n\n在现实世界中，房子、车子等等都有产权证来确权，但是在数字世界中，也是未来最重要的资产，怎么确权，就目前而言，在互联网中，个体的数字资产可谓被侵权的体无完肤，只要联网了，我们的联系方式、家庭住址、资产情况甚至健康情况完全可以被”有心人“购买。而这些数字产权本应属于个体。\n\n其实把比特币的数字货币定义为资产是非常合适的，就好比现实世界的房子和车子，根据比特币的特性，它是一种通缩型资产，也就是不会滥发。那这个资产在数字世界中可以进行抵押借贷，然后进行数字资产的投资，这一切在近些年来越来越多的DeFi项目中已经实现。\n\n试想一下，如果现实中的房产在数字世界进行NFT发行，拥有NFT即拥有房屋产权，而且具有唯一性，那数据产权的重要性可见一斑。\n\n六、个体隐私的重要性\n\n在国内，隐私的重要性似乎没有便利的重要性高，消费者认为只要方便了，自己的隐私没那么重要，四处可见的摄像头，滥用的人脸识别，所有的数据如果被用心险恶的人利用，其实消费者就将自己置于险境。\n\n在区块链世界里的通行证——钱包，并不需要我们与手机关联，也不需要我们与邮箱关联，唯一需要做的就是掌握自己的私钥，只要私钥不泄露，资产就不会被盗，只要私钥不丢失，资产就不会丢失。所有的应用通过钱包连接，在钱包背后的个体是谁并不重要。\n\n可能这里有人会说，那就无法阻止作恶的人为非作歹，可是我们的隐私被泄露了，为非作歹的人不是更猖狂吗，电信诈骗这样的例子还少吗？中本聪是谁，到现在也没有人知道，有可能就是旧金山街头的一名普通的程序员或者是东京的一位猥琐大叔，如果知道了他是谁，那么他可能就需要像扎克伯格一样，跑个步也要被保镖包围了吧。\n\n声明：1.这不是一篇科普贴\n\n2\\.这不是一篇口水贴\n\n3\\.这就是一篇自己思考的总结", "timestamp": 1633833005, "digest": "0U49OoPgZkPEcM_IRXltuDR2Ydz1CifLvq_SWt472Wc", "contributor": "0xBA38EEA0cd18a0Ba7eE1F5d9861FC7DaF2895929"}

{"id": "KY_tCeBQBKdc4EswgC3-xuLJkB6CKsLABwEfddPe2oI", "title": "梳理美 SEC 加密行业监管变迁，「强监管」时代来临？", "body": "2021 年 9 月 7 日，SEC 在不给予任何解释的情况下，对 Coinbase 的借代产品 Lend 发出诉讼警告，表示已经其认定为证券类别的投资合同，意味着这款产品必须要走证券审批流程。\n\n**Coinbase 创始人 Brian 彻底怒了，在推特上通过「21 问」对 SEC 发了「灵魂提问」。**SEC 此番行动如此的快速和不留情面，让人想起了 2017 年 SEC 对 DAO 发起的「关于对 DAO 认定为证券」的严正调查。\n\n但不可否认的是，SEC 要大力加强监管力度的决心可见一番。同时据报道就在今天，ETF 发行商 Volt Equity 的加密行业 ETF 获 SEC 批准，将于纽交所上市。\n\n**为此，本文我们主要围绕 SEC 对加密市场的监管进行了一番梳理。**\n\n### 美国加密市场的监管者：SEC、 CFTC、IRS、FinCEN\n\n美国的监管体系由州和联邦共同组成，一般来说他们是平级而相互独立的。今天我们主要科普一下联邦层面的主要监管者。\n\n#### 美国证券交易委员会（SEC）\n\nSEC 是美国证券业的最高监管管理部门，具有立法权、司法权和独立执法权。\n\n凡涉及《1934 证券交易法案》定义的证券产品，比如股票、债券、债务工具等投资合同，他们的发行和流通都属于 SEC 的监管范围。\n\n#### 商品期货交易委员会（CFTC）\n\nCFTC 的范围主要面向美国的商品期货、期权、金融期货期权市场，负责保护公众和市场参与者不受相关诈骗，同时通过立法确保期货和期权市场的开放性、竞争性和财务上的可靠性。\n\nSEC 和 CFTC 共同组成的职能，相当于国内的证监会，也是监管加密市场的主要部门。\n\n#### 国内税务局（IRS）\n\nIRS 主要是从税收政策方面监管加密市场，在如何定性加密资产的属性这个问题上，IRS 将其归类为广义财产，也就是说针对财产方面的税收条款，也同样适用于加密资产交易。**IRS 的考虑点主要是防范纳税人通过加密资产逃避税收责任。**\n\n因此，IRS 有权要求个人和机构就加密资产交易进行纳税申报，并且不定期要求交易平台或者个人提供加密账户的交易信息。\n\n#### 金融犯罪执法网络局 (FinCEN)\n\nFinCEN 针对的事务主要是关于反洗钱、防范非法交易和防止对恐怖主义活动的资助。它的执法依据是《银行保密法》，在加密资产服务商的定性上，FinCEN 认为他们属于资金服务业务链条中的资金转移中介，因此需要纳入监管。\n\n根据《银行保密法》，最基本的监管要求是：在 24 小时内，一次性的现金交易，或者关联交易总金额超过 1 万美元，机构方需要持牌，并且申报交易行为。\n\n### SEC 对加密市场的监管变迁： 发行融资、交易、借代、衍生品、平台\n\n#### 发行融资\n\nSEC 不会对所有的融资行为进行监管，多数情况下，只需要满足在 SEC 登记注册就可以运行。**纵观证券市场生命周期的所有环节，SEC 看得最紧的是发行融资阶段的合规性。**\n\n从 2014 年之后，涉及到在美国境内或者面向美国居民的 Token 融资，项目方以及所有提供服务的机构需要获得 SEC 批准或注册备案，否则需要承担巨额罚款。\n\n截止到今年 9 月份，SEC 已经开出超过 12 张罚单，主要针对不合规的 Token 融资和欺诈性项目。\n\nSEC 对「无证经营」以及「虚假项目」的审查和处罚从未放松，因为加密市场变化实在太快，投资人可能没有足够的知识储备和判断力，监管机构更加要履行好保护市场秩序的职责。\n\n#### 交易\n\nSEC 介入监管的标准很多，但一旦涉及「证券类」的投资合同，就必须纳入证券法的范畴。因此在 2018 年之后，中心化的交易平台必须遵守严格的牌照规定和合规要求，才能提供交易服务。\n\n而且交易平台必须有严格的 KYC 规章制度和切实可操作的 KYC 实施方案，对于客户身份以及资金来源的审查必须严格执行。\n\n#### 借贷\n\n不久前，SEC 新任主席表示，加密资产托管服务商和交易平台要注意了，因为可能很快提供借代和质押服务等行为可能需要纳入美国证券法的监管，监管机构正在制定针对性的监管规则。\n\n**SEC 的主要依据还是证券法，因为借贷和有回报质押合同接近于债权协议，可纳入监管范围。**2020 年去中心化借贷市场异常活跃，借贷规模接近 37 亿美元，引起了包括反洗钱金融行动工作组（FATF）的关注，并且正在推进对参与 Defi 交易的用户进行全面 KYC 的监管。\n\n#### 平台\n\n现在的趋势是，SEC 正逐渐地将监管的重点放在平台。在加密市场生态链中，平台的作用非常关键，因为这里是绝大部分投资人参与市场交易的入口。因此，无论是 SEC 还是州级别的监管部门，都一直在加强平台的合规性审查。\n\n**所以，尽管贵为全球综合排名靠前的中心化交易平台，Coinbase 却一直都是 SEC 的重点监管对象**。实际上，在今年 SEC 开出的针对加密市场的罚单，有接近一半是平台未注册的，或者交易未注册的证券 Token。\n\n### SEC 的监管目的： 系统性风险、表外负债、未知风险\n\n#### 提防爆发系统性风险\n\n近期 SEC 新主席在一个采访中谈到恒大债务事件，也许是受到这个事件的刺激，又或者是想重蹈 2008 年的金融危机，**SEC 在有意无意地加强上市企业的监管。这解释了为什么 Coinbase 突然间被发起「诉讼警告」。**\n\n警告是突然的，但逻辑是没错的，因为 Coinbase 已经是一家上市公司，推出基于加密资产的借代产品必然会面对更严格的审批，是意料之中的事。\n\nCoinbase Lend 是一款加密资产借代产品，考虑到 Coinbase 的用户数量巨大，SEC 担心如果加密市场崩盘，将会有范围极广的出资人受牵连。\n\n所以，SEC 关注的点是：这款产品是否应该定性为证券产品，如果是，则必须登记注册。虽然 Lend 更像是一款储蓄产品，但显然 SEC 坚持将其定性为证券投资。\n\n其实很多金融机构都提供类似的金融产品，比如 Square、Fidelitys 富达投资，他们都遵照要求，在 SEC 备案登记或者获得许可。\n\n#### 谨防上市公司因为加密业务导致表外负债激增\n\n上市企业的负债率过高，会增加破产清算的风险，尤为需要注意的是常被忽视的可转债。**由此可以推断，SEC 的下一个重点监管对象很有可能是 MicroStrategy （MS）。**\n\n在 [《推特、特斯拉、Paypal 等大厂纷纷入局，短期蹭热度还是长远布局？》](https://www.chainnews.com/articles/016621661244.htm) 中我们分析过，MS 举巨债买入 BTC，虽然使用可转债，但在债权人正式换成股份之前，它依然是企业的有息负债，所以同样增加了企业的债务负担，因此立马被评级机构下调买入等级。\n\nMS 间接掀起了一股全球上市公司的 BTC 买入潮，如今大约 25 家上市公司持有 BTC，其中以美企居多。**SEC 当然不可能置之不理，SEC 的宗旨是保护投资人。**\n\n假如其他上市公司纷纷效仿 MS 的做法，万一 BTC 大幅贬值，企业将不得不全额赎回债券，将会带来即时和巨大的现金流出压力。这是投资者以及 SEC 不敢想象的。\n\n*来源：COINGECKO*\n\n#### 未知风险：杠杆、数据造假、资产安全\n\nSEC 常常有让人费解的监管举措，这主要是针对加密市场的潜在未知风险。这些未知风险和技术紧紧相关，仅靠规章制度很难实现监督，对监管来说是巨大的挑战。\n\n因为加密市场有别于传统金融生态，比如项目主体不明确，运营机构所属地难界定问题，交易平台拔插头问题等等。这个领域发展太快，监管机构容易陷入一知半解的状态，因此，在监管方面既要遵循现有法律框架，又要进行实验性的监管尝试。\n\n* 杠杆\n\n杠杆交易风险主要集中在交易平台，尤其是远期合同类的交易，参与者数量远远超过现货交易，因为无论涨跌都能创造获利空间。杠杆率越高，反而刺激了价格的波动。\n\n**一些规则之外的因素，容易导致交易收益或者损失被无限放大。**比如平台系统出现「故障」，或者系统设置了交易限制等等。这些因素的出现极有可能导致用户无法合理止损。而交易平台或者平台往往有充足理由排除自身责任。这些问题都让 SEC 极为头痛。\n\n* 信息不对称\n\n另一个 SEC 一直在努力解决的是加密服务商的信息披露问题。以交易平台为例，关于资产的实际情况，用户和交易平台存在信息不对称的情况。\n\n一般来说，充值后，用户的 Token 会集中到交易平台的专用地址，只有「提现」时才会将资产转移至用户地址。用户的所有交易行为都不会导致 Token 的实际转移，只记录在交易平台的服务器中。\n\n也就是说，万一交易平台将资金转移到别的地址，用户是不知道的。更大的风险来自于服务商利用客户资产进行价格操纵等行为。因此，SEC 以及很多国家的监管机构都要求服务商提供充分证据，证明他们有规则制度保证信息的透明度。\n\n* 资产安全\n\nSEC 的监管主要关注在投资者保护，对于传统证券业市场来说，不存在太大的资产安全问题。但是对于数字类资产，不存在绝对安全的保管机制。因为中心化的资产存管方案和去中心化的网络协议，两者都有大量的用户资产被转移或者网络盗窃的案件发生。\n\n**当加密资产未通过冷钱包进行完全的网络隔离，就会暴露在链上，如果中心化机构出现道德问题，或者平台被黑客攻击，资产就有丢失风险。**\n\n所以 SEC 等监管机构在审批运营商资质之前，都会对他们对于资产安全保护的实力和意愿进行评估，一方面是关注他们是否有完善流程以及技术支撑，另一方面是关注他们的资金充足度。\n\n这些因素共同构成了较大的未知风险，这是监管机构的重点研究方向。\n\n### 那些被 SEC 发起挑战的案例： Libra、Ripple、Coinbase\n\n#### Libra：永远得不到 SEC 的「Like」", "timestamp": 1633833620, "digest": "n3brUC_InAGFsv50Y424ja1_T1HgQHBQ2ClBY116y0Y", "contributor": "0xf3f94cce7bA593D6160DB6013109df3f70c2484B"}

{"id": "q2p6-EMoCIKmnT4-DarjQD8__-dJTMA1E3HpE789SwI", "title": "Paradigm 介绍 NFT 碎片化原语 RICKS：如何解决 NFT 碎片化重组问题？", "body": "这篇文章描述了一种称为 RICKS 的 NFT 碎片化方案，这种设计解决了重组问题，确保 RICKS 始终可转换回其底层 NFT，同时避免 all-or-nothing 买断拍卖的流动性和协调问题。\n\n### 介绍\n\n本位介绍了一种新的 NFT 碎片化原语： RICKS （全称为 Recurrently Issued Collectively Kept Shards）。\n\n当你将 NFT 拆分为 RICKS 时，该协议会以恒定速率（例如每天 1% 或每月 5%）铸造新的碎片并出售它们。收益将作为 Staking 奖励分配给现有的 RICKS 持有者。\n\n这种设计解决了重组问题，确保 RICKS 始终可转换回其底层 NFT，同时避免 all-or-nothing 买断拍卖的流动性和协调问题。\n\n### 今天的 NFT 碎片化\n\n#### 重组问题\n\n对 NFT 进行拆分是很困难的事，因为这会面临一个 all-or-nothing 的问题。\n\n如果你想卖 8 块饼干的 25%，你可以卖其中的两块饼干，如果你想出售一家企业 25% 的股份，你可以出售其未来现金流的 25% 的权利。无论哪种情况，剩下的 75% 对你来说仍然是有用的。\n\n另一方面，拥有 75% 的游戏内资产可能无法让你在给定的游戏中使用该资产的一部分。如果你将此类资产的 25% 出售给买方，而他们拒绝将其卖回，甚至他们丢失了自己的私钥，那么你就有麻烦了。由于无法重组 NFT，即使你名义上拥有 99.99% 的所有权，该所有权也可能会变得一文不值。\n\n因此，碎片化协议必须提供某种方法来将 NFT 碎片重组回原始 NFT，我们将这种设计约束称为重组问题。\n\n#### 买断问题\n\n迄今为止最流行的解决方案是由 fractional.art 开创的，即买断拍卖（Buyout auction）。\n\n情况：Alice 使用带有买断拍卖机制的碎片化协议将其 NFT 的 25% 出售给 Bob。\n\n买断拍卖：第三方 Clara 可以随时触发碎片化 NFT 的买断拍卖：出价最高 ETH （可能是 Clara）的人将获得整个 NFT，并将销售收益以 75/25 的比例分配给 Alice 和 Bob。\n\n#### 买断拍卖的目的\n\n买断拍卖的存在是为了通过解决重组问题来确保 Alice 和 Bob 的碎片保持其公平的市场价值。\n\n要了解原因，假设 Alice 使用不提供买断拍卖的协议将她的 NFT （代表游戏内资产）分成 100 个碎片，在这种情况下，只有拥有所有 100 个碎片的人才能够重建 NFT。\n\n如果有人不小心销毁或弄丢了这 100 个碎片中的一个，那么任何人都无法重建这个 NFT，剩余的碎片将失去所有价值。由于这种风险，即使在碎片化时，100 个碎片中的每一个的价值都远低于原 NFT 价值的 1/100。\n\n而通过买断拍卖，失去其中一个碎片不再会破坏其它碎片的价值。例如，如果 Alice 在铸造后立即丢失了她的一个碎片，她可以发起买断拍卖并提交中标以取回 NFT，其中 99% 的收益归她所有。\n\n从这个意义上说，买断拍卖与其说是一种功能，不如说是一种必要的邪恶。它们当然不是为了像 Clara 这样的潜在感兴趣的买家的利益，它们一开始就不是碎片化 NFT 的利益相关者，因此不值得协议特别考虑。\n\n#### 意外买断\n\n不幸的是，由于资金限制，买断可能会遇到问题：如果 NFT 足够有价值，一旦拍卖开始，可能没有人能够筹集到足够的钱来支付一个公平的价格。\n\n例如以下情况：\n\nAlice 有一个价值 1,000 ETH 的 NFT，她使用带有买断拍卖机制的碎片化协议将其拆分，并将 50% 的碎片出售给 Bob。随后，市场状况突然发生了变化，这个 NFT 的公允价值跃升到了 100,000 ETH，这是该 NFT 在最佳条件下出售时可能获得的价值（例如在佳士得拍卖活动）。\n\n资本限制：找到愿意在短时间内以全额估值购买该 NFT 的买家可能是不现实的。也许这个 NFT 在一周内的链上拍卖中最多只能获得 10,000 ETH。\n\n碎片持有者分歧：由于 10,000 ETH 远低于这个 NFT 的公允价值，Alice 会强烈反对以这个价格出售。另一方面，Bob 对公允价值没有强烈的感觉，并愿意以较低的价格出售这个 NFT，因为这仍然是其最初购买价格的 10 倍，这样，他就可以购买他更喜欢的其他 NFT。\n\n收藏家机会：一位精明的收藏家 Clara 发现了这个机会，并发起了 10,000 ETH 的买断竞拍。而包括 Alice 在内的任何人都无法在短时间内击败 Clara 的出价，因此她赢得了这个 NFT 的所有权，然后几个月后她在佳士得拍卖会上以 100,000 ETH 的价格卖掉了这个 NFT。\n\n#### 保留价格\n\n为了避免这种情况，fractional.art 在其买断拍卖机制中包含了一个底价，它指定了可以发起买断竞拍的最低价格。在上面的例子中，如果底价设置为 100,000 ETH，Clara 将无法以 10,000 ETH 发起拍卖。\n\n而当用户试图设定底价时，问题就来了。在上面的例子中，Alice 不想以远低于 100,000 ETH 的公允价值出售 NFT，但 Bob 并不介意。在这里达成协议可能非常困难并且存有争议，特别是当涉及的各方可能会随着碎片易手而改变时。\n\n在实践中，设置底价需要碎片所有者的积极参与。因此，由于参与者的注意力需求，它们不会经常更新。目前还没有人找到一种底价机制来解决意外买断的问题。\n\n### 真实案例研究：僵尸 Punk 买断\n\n活死人派对（The Party of the Living Dead ）是一群 NFT 爱好者，他们联合起来竞标一个稀有的僵尸 CryptoPunk，然后他们以 1200 ETH 的价格买到了一个僵尸 CryptoPunk，随后，他们在 fractional.art 上对其进行碎片化，并按照贡献者的贡献比例将碎片分配给贡献者。\n\n在最初的碎片化过程中，有 5 个鲸鱼地址共同拥有了这个 NFT 56% 的碎片份额，而其余部分碎片则分散在其他 451 名参与者手中。\n\n#### 买断\n\n这个僵尸 Punk 的碎片随后在 Uniswap 上进行交易，一位匿名收藏家意识到这些碎片的价格相对于其他僵尸 Punk 的价值来说是被低估了。这位收藏家购买了足够的碎片来增加其个人的底价投票权，然后降低买断底价，并发起了买断拍卖。\n\n这个买断拍卖以 1,100 ETH 的价格开始（低于活死人派对的收购价），并最终以 1,900 ETH 的价格收盘。\n\n注意：如果你为此 PartyBid 做出了贡献，请确保你在此处收集了你的 dead token，以便你可以在此处‌领取你的最终买断价格部分。\n\n#### 不开心的碎片持有者\n\n很多非鲸鱼碎片持有者对这次买断竞拍并不满意，他们认为这次收购的价格太低。\n\n不幸的是，他们发现自己基本上无能为力。单独来看，他们中没有人能够获得足够的流动性来击败出价并直接购买 NFT。即使他们想联合起来以单一投标人的身份购买 NFT，协调开销以及有限的可用时间也使这条路径变得不可行。\n\n### RICKS\n\n#### 概述\n\nRICKS 解决了重组问题，同时避免了完全买断的流动性和协调问题。\n\n该协议不是一个 all-or-nothing 的买断拍卖机制，而是以恒定速率为给定的 NFT 发行新的 RICKS （例如，每天 1%，或每月 5%），这些新的 RICKS 在拍卖中以 ETH 出售，收益将作为 Staking 奖励提供给现有的 RICKS 持有者。\n\n正如我们将在下面解释的，希望增加其所有权且流动性受限的买家，总是可触发少于一整天新增 RICKS 数量的拍卖。\n\n这意味着 NFT 的所有权总是逐渐流向愿意为其支付最多费用的人，而现有所有者则从中受益。\n\nRICKS 允许有动力的买家随着时间的推移获得 NFT 的绝大多数所有权。我们通过添加极端多数所有者完成其所有权并重组 NFT 的机制来解决重组问题。\n\n举个例子：\n\n当 Alice 的 NFT 价值 1000 ETH 时，她使用 RICKS 机制将其 NFT50% 的碎片卖给了 Bob。现在，市场条件发生了变化，NFT 在最佳执行销售时的公允价值为 100,000 ETH。但是，没人能在短时间内为其提供那么多流动性。\n\n碎片持有者分歧：第三方 Clara 想以 10,000 ETH 的价格购买整个 NFT，Bob 对这个提议很满意，但 Alice 并不同意，她不希望以低于公允价值的价格出售这个 NFT。此时，Alice 和 Bob 各有 50 个 RICKS （总共 100 个），而发行率为 1%。\n\n收藏家机会：Clara 参加每日拍卖并以 10,000 ETH 的估价出价，对于这个 NFT 的 1%，一个 RICKS 的总价值为 100 ETH。\n\n保护公平价格：Alice 意识到这个出价太低，以 90,000 ETH 估值出价，或 900 ETH 购买一个 RICKS。由于她拥有现有 RICKS 的一半，并将获得拍卖收益的一半，因此她只需要提供 450 ETH 来资助她的出价。\n\n#### 潜在结果\n\n之后就可能会发生以下两种结果：\n\n1. 如果 Clara 的出价不超过 Alice，则 Alice 将赢得拍卖。她将向 Bob 支付 450 ETH，并将获得一个额外的 RICKS，因此她现在拥有 51/101 RICKS，或 50.5% 的供应量。Alice 和 Bob 以他们都认为有利的价格相互交易。\n2. 如果 Clara 的出价比 Alice 高，比如说支付 1,000 ETH 的公允价格，那么 Alice 和 Bob 将各自获得 500 ETH，而 Clara 将获得一个 RICKS，因此她现在拥有 1/101 的碎片，或略低于 1%。同样，Alice、Bob 和 Clara 都以他们满意的价格进行了交易。\n\n无论哪种方式，如果这种活动随着时间的推移而持续存在，它将引起注意和买方流动性，从而提高所有相关方以公允价格进行交易的可能性。\n\n#### 完成买断\n\n假设 Clara 的目标就是拥有这个 NFT，并以 100,000 ETH 的估值反复竞标 RICKS，这是其他人都无法匹敌的价格。最终，她拥有了 99% 的 RICKS （也许是在赢得拍卖 458 天之后），现在，她想申领这个 NFT，为此，协议中将需要一个额外的机制。\n\n一种方法是承认 RICKS 有一些内在的缺陷，并使用一种彩票机制。例如，如果一个持有者控制了 NFT 99% 的碎片，他们可能会触发一个抛硬币程序，如果这个币正面朝上，他们得到整个 NFT （因此他们额外获得 1%），如果是背面朝上，则其他所有者的头寸将翻倍（因此，这个持有者将损失 1%）。从预期价值的角度来看，这一程序是完全公平的。\n\n为了避免 99% 边界附近出现奇怪的情况，我们可以允许 NFT 碎片的大股东持有者在 98%、90% 甚至 75% 时触发抛硬币程序，但需要注意的是，离 99% 阈值越远，其赢得其余碎片的概率就越低。\n\n#### 拍卖详情\n\n如果碎片化 NFT 变得足够昂贵，对于大多数人来说，即使出价 1% 也可能会贵得让人望而却步。此外，在某些日子里，可能没有人对拍卖感兴趣，因此举行拍卖将是一种浪费。\n\n因此，RICKS 协议可以实现一个按需拍卖系统，而不是每天举行拍卖：如果距离上次拍卖已经有 t 天了，并且发行率是 r/ 天，那么协议将拍卖\n\n个碎片。我们取经过的时间和 1 天中的最小值，以避免一次发出太多 RICKS。\n\n例如，如果发行率为每天 1%，因此 r=1.01，并且在触发新的拍卖时距离上次拍卖已经过去了半天，那么协议将发行和出售\n\n个新的 RICKS 供应量。\n\n### 附带功能\n\n#### 套利\n\n就像现在的碎片化 NFT 一样，我们希望 RICK 可以在 Uniswap 等 AMM DEX 上进行交易。这提供了一种方便的套利机制，以确保 RICKS 拍卖不会以过低的价格完成：如果拍卖的收盘价明显低于 Uniswap 上的 RICKS 价格，套利者可以通过在拍卖中购买 RICKS，然后立即在 Uniswap 上出售来获利。\n\n#### 拍卖底价\n\n我们可以考虑将这一逻辑进一步推进，并指定 RICKS 拍卖出价必须至少比 Uniswap TWAP 价格高出 5% 或 10%。\n\n因为一个足够积极的买家仍然能够在足够长的时间范围内积累 NFT 的所有权，重组问题仍然会得到解决。而且，由于拍卖会以高于 Uniswap 的价格进行交易，因此它们可能会造成最小的抛售压力。\n\n另一方面，这种修改会降低 RICKS 持有者 staking 奖励的一致性。它还使重组变得更加困难，而且很难先验地判断其对市场的影响。\n\n#### 碎片化发布\n\nRICKS 提供了一种自然机制来启动 NFT 的新部分碎片，NFT 所有者不必在 Uniswap 上提供碎片并选择价格，而是可以简单地使用 RICKS 进行拆分，自己以 100% 所有者的身份开始，让自动拍卖来处理其余部分。\n\n#### 申领拍卖收益\n\nRICKS 持有者需要质押他们的 RICKS 才能获得拍卖收益。\n\n然而，这对可组合性提出了挑战。 特别是，始终无法确定 Uniswap V3 上每个集中流动性头寸持有多少 RICKS，这意味着拍卖收益不能直接提供给 Uniswap V3 流动性提供者。\n\n相反，RICKS 协议将跟踪所有 Uniswap V3 LP 拥有的总 RICKS，并将所有这些的拍卖收益用于 Uniswap V3 池子的流动性挖矿奖励，如本文所述。通过这种方式，激励市场参与者尽可能有效地向资金池提供流动性。\n\n这个问题还有其他潜在的解决方案，包括（1）创建一个包含 RICKS 和 ETH 拍卖收益的封装 RICKS 代币；（2）将拍卖收益重定向到 RICKS 的回购，但两者都有明显的缺点。\n\n### 下一步\n\n我们希望 RICKS 能让 NFT 碎片化变得更加有趣和有用。\n\n它们还开辟了一个全新的设计空间，例如，我们可以让 RICKS 质押者在未来的拍卖中自动使用他们的奖励进行竞价。RICKS 也可以汇集在一起形成链上的「委员会」，由具有类似属性的 RICKS 组成，如例如 Zombie Punks 或 Wizard Hat 和 Scarf Ocelots。\n\n*如果你有兴趣与我们一起探索，我们很乐意听取你的意见。你可以在 twitter 上找到我们，@Dave_White, @andy8052 and @danrobinson。*", "timestamp": 1633834139, "digest":

Omarova 的《人民账本：如何使货币民主化和为经济融资》。虽然我不同意作者提出的所有结论，并且我试图进一步推动框架，但我感谢她如此有效地连接这么多点的精神上的认可。\n\n并非一直如此。在将布雷顿森林体系和全球金融危机分开的三十五年左右的时间里，特许经营体系实际上运作良好。中央银行在调节货币供应方面保持垄断，商业银行从事分配，最重要的是将这种供应（通过贷款）分配给用户。这三个层次通过一套机械和监管要求保持联系，使主权国家能够引导经济并控制总体风险。\n\n到 2000 年代初，情况发生了变化。对做了什么的描述远远超出了这篇每周文章的范围，但重点是中央银行发现自己越来越多地从事传统上保留给商业部门的货币分配职能。COVID-19 人道主义危机进一步加剧了这种情况：在美国，美联储创建了两个公司设施——一级市场公司信贷设施和二级市场公司信贷设施，以及事实上的市政贷款设施为企业和机构提供直接访问中央银行资产负债表的途径，并绕过商业银行的传统信贷承销角色。在新的去中心化中介机构的出现的激励下，这些中央银行也开始考虑扩大其在货币分配方面的作用是很自然的。结果是全球急于制作中央银行数字货币的原型。\n\n正如我们已经在 DR 上争论过的，一场金钱的内战正在上演。尽管监管机构为保护商业银行在未来货币生态系统中的作用做出了许多努力——无论真实与否，但不可否认的是，权力正在发生变化。这篇文章的重点并不是说谁就会导致这个新兴的系统，但尝试和猜测如何它可能看起来像。该蓝图可以作为一个有用的地图来导航价值转移领域中发生的创新。\n\n### 新货币体系\n\n那么新的货币体系如何运作呢？让我们继续挖掘。\n\n#### 新的货币配置\n\n一个主权发行某种形式的很可能仍坐在货币食物链的顶端。此类发行人将是唯一的货币当局，与主权社区（国家、联邦、公司、DAO 等）相关联，控制一组支持货币供应的有形和无形资产。发行人可以通过两种不同的方式向用户分发和分配硬币：\n\n1. 将这些代币直接投放给用户——基于一组参数化决策\n2. 通过一组合格的中介分配额外的硬币\n\n**机制（1）**→权威机构根据自己的决策机制决定向社区成员空投硬币（CBDC、稳定币、任何其他形式的价值存储）。用 CBDC 的术语来说，这相当于允许所有公民（和企业）在中央银行开设一个账户，在那里存入和查看他们的代币。鉴于主权者和使用者之间的直接联系，机制（1）既包含传统的货币分配功能，也包含货币分配功能。在主权发行人选择保留对货币分配的完全控制的情况下，仅机制 (1) 就足以使系统完整。\n\n**机制 (2）**→ 然而，集中的货币分配是一头难以驯服的野兽。由于操作复杂和信息不对称，它很容易出现效率低下和道德风险。想象一个中央机构（印钞机）决定向谁提供资金、金额和期限，您已经可以开始想象系统无法运行的一长串原因了。\n\n这就是为什么如机制 (2) 中所述，通过一系列合格的中介机构采取行动会有所帮助。这在某种程度上类似于今天通过商业银行部门在特许经营系统中发生的情况。然而，不同之处在于这将如何发生。与特许经营体系中的角色相比，信用中介将失去对客户存款的垄断；因此，它们的功能将仅仅成为合格信贷资产的聚合和传递。有资格由新印的货币集中资助，通过这种方式，主权发行人将把识别和定价良好信用的大部分繁重工作委托给中介机构，同时保留对所有资格参数的完全控制。\n\n我们可以看到，在这种新配置中，主权发行人将如何在不影响效率的情况下增强对货币操纵和货币分配的控制和可见性。但主权发行人不应保留对所铸造硬币使用的垄断权。以同样的方式美元纸币可以在未必符合美国的法律框架的方式来使用，用户仍然可以自由地使用用例涉及操纵价值无限多的参与，而外面的主权边界；但是，这样做时，他们将无法从在合格生态系统中发挥作用所提供的影响力中受益。\n\n### 金融中介的工作\n\n如上所述，合格的中介比其他任何东西都更抽象。某种中介一直存在于复杂的系统中，而今天可能出现一个新品种的事实只是与我们现在可以使用的技术有关，而这些技术直到最近才出现。\n\n在极端情况下，中介机构可能只是超安全和标准化资产的聚合器，为用户提供一些基本功能和收益。这是 Circle 的 USDC 方式——一个 31.1 美元的货币市场基金，在 DeFi 中拥有全额准备金和一套出色的兼容服务。尽管这种巴菲特式的游戏（对波特的信任）通过聚合可投资流动性流而资本成本可忽略不计甚至为负，很可能对 Circle 有利可图，但此类聚合器对资金分配的影响将是有限的，并且风险被空投的 CBDC 高位所取代。\n\n一组更有趣的中介是我们可以称为算法管道的中介。主权发行人会将一组符合条件的资产（抵押品）列入白名单，以通过贴现窗口融资，加上一组参数，并让最终用户质押并独立管理铸造的硬币。MakerDAO 的金库就是这种情况——如果我们排除真实世界的资产金库。用户在 Maker 金库中发布抵押品（例如 ETH）并获得新铸造的 DAI 作为交换。他们面临清算风险，需要监控协议投票的参数变化。如果我们排除算法稳定币（这需要单独讨论），每个加密稳定币代表对合格中介概念的不同看法。\n\n这种新货币配置的中介可以一个叠一个。**让我们看看下面的例子。**\n\n某种（不合格的）中介在某种结构内聚合资产。这些可能是链上抵押品——例如 ERC-20 或 ERC-721 代币，以及链下合同或声誉协议。同时，这样的中间人堆积了一组负债来为这些资产的购买提供资金——例如，来自中间人本身的一些（初级）承销资本和来自流动性提供者的流动性。这可以由任何人以任何形式、针对任何类型的资产完成，同时不受主权货币体系的限制。为了给负债持有人提供一定的安全边际，中介需要保留一个缓冲，即资产的感知价值与负债的感知价值之间的差异。除非有最后的贷款人，没有办法摆脱超额抵押的问题。这是大多数情况现在，在 DeFi 中的贷款提供商，其中流动性以 USDC、USDT 或 DAI 的形式由 Goldfinch、 TrueFi 和 Maple 等公司汇总，未经 Circle、Tether、Maker 或其他任何人的授权。\n\n尽管这些公司中的每一个都采用不同的模式，但它们都试图为投资者汇总价值主张，同时试图将每个人的激励措施围绕一个共同的目标进行调整。\n\n**TrueFi**→ TrueFi 采取了集中化的方式，通过审查想要申请贷款的借款人，并允许流动性提供者从他们自己的原生稳定币 TrueUSD 上赚取利息。在这样做的过程中，他们一直试图通过从底层整合货币分配和分配来解决超额抵押的难题。然而，鉴于 TrueUSD 的全额保留性质，货币分配受到强烈盯住美元的限制，使得货币扩张无法处理。这似乎并不让贷方担心，而 TrueFi 迄今已起源于 c。三个池中的 5.51 亿美元 - USDT、USDC、TUSD。\n\n**Maple**→ Maple 站在中间地带。Maple 没有在评分或审查新借款人方面发挥积极作用，而是退后一步，而是选择他们想要在他们的平台上加入的赞助商，让这些赞助商完成工作。在 Maple，Pool Delegates 制定自己的投资和承销政策，并启动一个池来汇总他们选择的一组借款人的资产。为了向市场表明他们的激励措施与其他人一致，他们也是这些池中初级亏损资本的赌注者。贷方相反，向池中提供额外的高级资本，被动参与资产收益。Maple 目前有 USDC 1.8 亿承诺资本，大部分已提取。Maven 11 资本池（见下文）有 15 笔活跃贷款，并获得了 USDC。自成立以来，流动性提供者（以 USDC 和 MPL 治理代币的形式）的 APY 为 28%。在同一时期，它为矿池代表和财政部产生了 > USDC 500k 的费用。到目前为止，还没有任何贷款违约，因此我们可能需要再等一段时间，看看在没有强大的链上抵押的情况下，这个（纤薄的 - USDC 约 270 万美元）初级产品如何能够坚持下去。\n\n### 将中介堆叠在一起\n\n在一种程式化的形式中，Maple 的作案手法类似于上述场景，尽管大多数抵押资产位于链外。最后一个方面，即智能合约中没有全追索权抵押品，可能会限制 DeFi 生态系统内的可组合性。这似乎并没有限制 Maple 的增长，所以可组合性真的很重要吗？\n\n我认为确实如此。您离回报来源越远，评估风险就越具有挑战性。有了对全追索权抵押的可信访问，贷款结构可能会变得任意复杂，而不会放大边际投资者的风险。通过层层叠加，我们可以构建更有效的结构，吸引多元化的投资者。例如，像 Maple 这样的金融中介可以建立一个超级高级职位，在主权货币体系内申请资格，并通过贴现窗口为其融资，从而提高整个堆栈的杠杆率和回报。在流动性和承销资本 LP 代币本身可以无限创意地使用。在 DeFi 中，这可以通过参数化和编程方式完成，而不会失去对信用创建机制的可见性和控制。可组合性再次很重要。\n\n但谁将成为这个最后的主权发行人？它会是像 MakerDAO 这样的加密原生货币发行人，还是像 Maker 那样的人？还是美联储通过普遍可访问的 CBDC？还是迪姆？还是像国际货币基金组织这样的政府财团？我认为现在下结论还为时过早，从某种意义上说，这并不重要：您始终可以在开始的先前贷款人基础上叠加一个新的最后贷款人，而不会影响整个堆栈。\n\n有一个问题。当一个接一个地堆叠金融砖时，事情很快就会变得非常复杂。监控特许经营系统内的系统性风险是一项更直接的工作，只有少数聚合商（即受监管的银行）整合了大量现在无序分布的角色。那是宏观审慎银行业监管的黄金年代。然而，真正的权衡不是在风险和无风险之间，而是在可观察和不可观察的风险之间。这就是为什么今天任何改革货币体系的尝试都不能撇开对全栈传输和分配机制的深刻理解，即 TradFi 或 DeFi。如果一棵树倒在金融系统的森林中，它总是会发出噪音，即使没有人在听。\n\n来源链接：[dirtroads.substack.com](https://dirtroads.substack.com/p/dr-16-full-stack-central-banking)\n\n免责声明：作为区块链信息平台，本站所发布文章仅代表作者个人观点，与链闻 ChainNews 立场无关。文章内的信息、意见等均仅供参考，并非作为或被视为实际投资建议。", "timestamp": 1633835288, "digest": "QP-cjCIu2P-YXd3zCxB_RBTKKjKKNMYoJ7nFswawj0k", "contributor": "0x11d3Cd1A32d4d690427FF1913fF7B2b5d9deb117"}

各位朋友们，大家好。作为一个在区块链行业工作的普通人，结合过去拥有的法律知识和实践经验，作为在Mirror平台的第一篇文章，想和大家分享关于区块链以及分散式金融（DeFi）背后的含义，法律背后的含义，以及未来如果要规制区块链的话，可能被采取的规制等一些问题的看法（在中国大陆地区已经禁止加密货币交易的前提下，我们重要会讨论美国等地区的规制问题）。希望各位朋友可以共同探讨，期待这个区块链这个圈子可以带领我们走向更加美好的未来。\n\n##     第一部分 区块链以及分散式金融的本质\n\n    区块链本质是一种分布式的数据库。密码学技术，帮助我们实现了如何安全的构架这种分布式数据库。而产生这种分布式数据库的原因在于，中央集权式的数据库本身的脆弱性，即中央数据库的损坏会导致整个系统的崩溃。我们希望，系统拥有一定的容错性，即在系统中部分节点出现问题，也不会造成整个系统的崩溃。这样，我们可以更加持久，更加放心的使用服务。而这背后的本质在于，我们不相信世界上存在永远牢不可破的中心节点，即对节点的非信任性。这里的节点，换到现实世界中，可以是指任何人，也可以是指任何机构。\n\n    分散式金融是基于区块链技术形成的分布式金融系统。分散式金融当然的拥有区块链的特征，即金融系统的容错性。因此，分散式金融帮助我们实现了一些，现在金融系统无法实现，或者是很难实现的一些功能。例如，365\\*24的全天候服务，基于个人而非身份的平等服务，更加低廉的服务费用等。分散式金融的背后也和区块链技术同样，是一种对于节点的非信任性。\n\n     一直以来，信任是一种非常昂贵，以及难以维持的东西。你可能会被多年的朋友背叛，你也可能会被多年信赖的企业所欺骗。反过来说，一个朋友想要维持和你的信任，需要花费的时间和成本是无法计算的，同样一个企业想要获得消费者的信任也是需要花费无数的时间和金钱的。但是，毁掉这种信任，缺只需要一件事，或者一次违约而已。然而，区块链以及分散式金融就是这样一种，无需信赖的单个节点，而是可以信赖的系统。这背后，本质上是指信赖这个世界上大多数的人（或者说是50%以上的人）。如果我们并不信赖这个世界50%以上的人，恐怕任何人都难以在这个社会生存吧，因为缺乏信赖的生活，成本会非常高。信赖的好处正是，可以降低成本。这种成本可以是时间上的成本，也可以是金钱上的成本，甚至是情感上的成本。\n\n##     第二部分 法律的本质\n\n    说到法律的本质，不得不让我会想起曾经的法理学和法哲学的老师的教导。有关于法律的探讨可能会晦涩难懂，我尽量说的通俗易懂一些。说到法律背后的含义，自然就会出现，实证法主义以及自然法主义这两种学派了。不过，从我们的感受上来看，法律应该更接近于自然法。毕竟，从法律的历史演变就可以看出，法律应该是基于大多数人的行为习惯以及思想而产生的一种集体价值观念的系统化。自古历来，人们对于穷凶极恶的罪犯就应当除以严刑的朴素价值观念，因此，现代刑法也对于故意杀人等犯罪处以最高死刑（或者是永久监禁，这里不涉及对于死刑制度的探讨）。\n\n    但是，当人们发现，人人平等的情况下，没有人拥有制裁他人的权力，只有法律可以代替所有人去制裁他人。那法律如果是基于人的价值观念产生的话，也会因为人的价值观念而改变，这样的话，法律的稳定性就会被破坏。大多数人很难生活在，一个朝令夕改的社会中的，因为要花费的成本太高。如果法律本身就只是法律，不依照人的价值观念产生的话，自然不会有上述的问题。然而，恶法亦法的结果，会让大多数人难以接受，尤其是在战争爆发的时候。所以，法律回过头来，本质还是更接近于自然法的存在。\n\n    可以看出，法律本质上也是一种系统，是基于对大多数人的信任的系统。大多数人的价值观念是值得信赖的，因此基于这种价值观念产生的法律也是可以信赖的。法律是制度上实现了这种信赖，而区块链则是从技术上实现了这种信赖。\n\n##     第三部分 区块链与法律\n\n    区块链和法律从某种程度上都是实现了信赖的机制的话，那这两者的区别是什么。虽然有很多不同，但是我想说，最大的一点不同是，适用范围的不同。\n\n    法律存在一种法域的概念，就是指法律可以使用的范围。虽然有属人，属地等原则，大多数的情况下，可以实现的法律是基于国家行政范围的。也就是说，法律的施行（司法）是基于国家的强制力，而国家的强制力是基于国家行政范围的。然而，区块链技术并没有这种实践意义上的范围限制。任何国家，任何人都可以使用区块链技术。也可以说（虽然很不准确），区块链从某种成度上实现了，对于参与的所有人的“法律“的创设（从定义上来讲，是不能称作法律的，仅从意义上有共通之处，因此加上了双引号）。而这种“法律”，可能是自然法的某种更加具体的表现。\n\n    当然，区块链实现这种“法律”的代价是，只能规定最基本的规则，而不能拥有更加复杂，具体，和地域性的规则。而现代意义上的法律，司法的意义某种程度上要大于立法的意义。无法执行的法律，在人们心中很难认为是法律，哪怕立法是完美的。因此，法律必然需要，更加具体，更加可以执行，而且基于国家行政范围，也更加具有地域性。而这一切是和区块链的初衷是相反的（并不是不能实现，例如联盟链，私有链等。但是这种区块链，缺乏了第一部分说的这种信赖机制。）因此，通过现代法律实现对于区块链技术的管理，从本质上，可能就不是一个好的实践。因为，这两者都是基于同一种价值观念形成的，而难以相互制约。\n\n##     第四部分 实践上可能对区块链实行的义务要求\n\n    实践上，国家对于区块链的规制的理由可以有很多，例如基于金融稳定，基于投资者保护等等。而大多数国家也会选择对于区块链进行规制。因为，技术如果没有法律的规制，自然也会危害到人自身，而且区块链技术的初衷无法实现更加具体的规则制定，因此就需要外部帮助区块链技术变得更及具体，哪怕这种实现会让区块链偏离本来的初衷。\n\n    当然，如果法律实现了对于区块链技术的规制，带来的好处是，可以让更多的人，更大规模的机构参与进来，也加快了区块链技术普及的速度。接下来分析一下，区块链技术，特别是加密货币投资以及分散式金融的主战场美国，可能会制定的一些规则。首先，明确一点，金融相关法律的制定，在美国的原则就是投资者保护主义。而投资者保护主义的原因是，金融市场的参与者之间信息不对称。而弥补这种信息不对称的主要方式就是信息的公开披露。基于这些，我们从区块链业界中各种参与主体的角度来分析可能被要求遵守那些规则。\n\n###     1）矿工（Miner） \n\n    矿工是区块链网络中最重要的参与者，以及利益获得者。矿工从技术上说，就是前文中所称的节点。他们具体的任务是，通过计算哈希函数打包区块，广播交易，确认区块，更新状态，即维持区块链网络的更新和运行。矿工通过上述行为，获得区块链奖励，即各种币。矿工和一般市场投资者最大的区别就是，打包交易的选择权。在无数等待打包的交易中，优先选择哪些交易处理（虽然有基于手续费的规则，但是矿工还是可以选择），甚至是拒绝打包某些地址的交易等权力是矿工独有的。如果，矿工利用这种权力，进行利益交换的话，就会出现市场的不公平。因此，矿工可能会被要求遵守的规则包括： 公开算力相关信息（机器类型，运行时间，版本型号，机器，电力，维护等成本等） 公开挖矿奖励相关信息（获得奖励的数量，时间，奖励变现方法，时间，金额等） 公开和上市公司相同的财务报表，重大利益关联等相关信息（资产负债表，现金流表，损益计算表等，股权结构，公司架构，利益相关方，利益相关行为等）\n\n###     2）做市商（MarketMaker）\n\n    在加密货币市场，维持市场流动性的最大的参与者就是做市商。可以把币安（Binance），火币（HuobiGlobal），Coinbase等做市商看成是传统金融市场中的投资银行。矿工可以影响供给量，做市商可以影响价格。首先，做市场存在和一般投资者之间的直接的利益冲突问题。特别是在金融衍生品上，做市商对于价格波动的影响会非常大，而金融衍生品中，投资者亏的钱都是做市商的利润，因此对于金融衍生品交易的这部分，很大可能性，会被极其严格的规制。例如，杠杆倍数限制（防止市场波动导致做市商破产），100%甚至以上的保证金（信托管理），适格投资者限制（对于投资者的KYC，交易经验以及最低保证金限制等），所有业务总和的风险敞口控制（类似于银行的巴塞尔条约）等。其他的和矿工类似，财务报表，重大利益关联等相关信息的开示也很可能被要求。相比于矿工，做市商直接对接投资者，因此被要求的规则会更加严格。\n\n###     3）托管机构（Custody）\n\n    托管机构，顾名思义就是帮助他人管理财产的机构。在加密货币的世界中，有很多有名的托管机构例如Bitgo等。他们负责安全的保存客户寄存在他们那里的加密货币资产。虽然加密货币本质上受到密码学自身的保护。但是，公钥和密钥的存在，必然会产生密钥泄露，被盗等危险。一直处于互联网连接状态的电脑本身就是不安全的这一事实，是需要每个投资者铭记在心的。因此托管机构利用各种软硬方法，实现客户资产的安全托管（包括但不限于冷钱包，多签等技术）。对于这类机构，由于他们管理着大量的资产，无论是从利益冲突上，还是技术安全上都应当对于他们要求极其高的义务。包括但不限于，客户资产和自有资产的分离管理，财务报表，重大利益关联等相关信息的公开，足额保证金（甚至是超额），危机处理方案等。\n\n##     第五部分 区块链中特殊的参与者以及应当如何规制的问题\n\n    在区块链和分散式金融的世界中，例如Uniswap这样的自动做市商，例如AAVE这样的自动借贷服务，我们把这类完全由代码控制的金融服务成为分散式金融服务（DeFi）。同样，控制着这些服务的，不是某些大型机构或组织，而是由投资者，工程师等组成的分散性自律组织（DAO）。无论是DeFi还是DAO，他们也都是区块链世界的参与者。\n\n    为何要单独拿出来这些参与者进行分析，原因在于他们和第四部分所讲是的参与者有着根本性的不同。根据第一部分和第二部分的讲述，可以认为，未来的金融应当是像区块链的初衷一样，基于区块链系统，而非单独节点，为更多的人提供更加便利廉价和可靠的服务。因此，当一种金融服务本身，不是由单独节点所管理控制的情况下，特别是当金融服务本身就是由投资者本人参与管理的情况下（例如DAO，但是对于分散度的讨论，需要单独一篇文章来分析），我们不应当要求这类金融服务以及他们的管理组织（DAO）履行和上述矿工，做市商和托管机构相同的信息公开义务。原因在于，他们与投资者之间并不存在市场信息的不对称，自然也就没有信息公开的义务，而且投资者和管理者一致的情况下，也不存在利益冲突。因此我认为不应当对于这类组织或服务采取过多的规则干涉，只要求最低限度的规则（例如：组织成员的公开，服务代码的公开，安全审计等）即可。\n\n    但是有一个不得不讨论的问题就是对于分散式金融的用户是否进行以及如何进行KYC以及AML的验证。我们先要来考虑要求KYC和AML验证的原因。由于这个世界上并不是所有人都是把资金用于善意的行为，把资金用于犯罪行为，甚至是战争行为的个人和组织在这个世界上也存在着。虽然这类人和组织并不是占据大多数（50%以上），但是他们的行为的恶劣程度是会极大的损害这个世界上生存的其他个人和组织的利益（包括但不限于生命安全利益）。因此为了遏制这类行为的发生，最好的方法就是要求身份验证（KYC）以及反洗钱验证（AML）等。\n\n    但是一旦进行了KYC和AML的认证，就会存在接下来的问题。这些数据由谁管理，无论是组织甚至是国家，都会是单节点管理。这些数据一旦被单节点控制，就会存在利用这些数据进行利益交换的问题（包括但不限于政治上经济上的利益）。对于这个问题，有一种解决方案是可以不需要两害之间取其轻的选择，就是分散式身份验证。（关于AML的解决方案，我们会在别的文章中讨论，因为涉及的问题较多）\n\n    KYC验证要解决的一个问题就是“用户是谁”。然而只要我们可以特定某个地址背后的用户是一个人或者复数的人，或者一个组织（从管理账户的实际角度来说也是应该是一个或者复数的人），而且让这些数据以分布式的状态存在，这样就不会存在单节点控制的问题。但是会有人提出另一类问题，这样分布式存在的数据，会不会轻易的暴露个人隐私？\n\n    答案是不会，因为分散式身份验证只能证明，这个地址的背后是特定的一个人，而且能知道这个人是和某些人有联系，而且这个人需要定期登录以证明自己是个真实存在的人。但是这个人的地址等详细情况并不会存在与分布式数据库中。当出现问题的时候，需要警方借助其他刑侦技术，从而确定这个人的确切住址等信息。我认为，这种成本是为了维持非单节点控制的必要成本。因为如果分散式金融只有服务本身是分散式的，而其相关联的所有服务都是单节点控制的话，这种服务本身是无法实现区块链的全部初衷的。",

{"id": "rqbp38n0ylwSrYUTs1sH1nwYmxOu_7VnklIKH5KPTmA", "title": "‘DeFi’ movement promises high interest but high risk - Forbes", "body": "Earlier this year, San Francisco start-up Compound promised yield-hungry investors something rarely seen in the US: interest rates that exceeded 10 per cent at times, just for moving money on to its app’s lending platform. Compound is not a bank, in the familiar sense. Rather, it is one of dozens of new Silicon Valley groups developing so-called decentralised finance — or “DeFi” — projects aiming to disintermediate traditional financial institutions. To date, digital currencies and their underlying blockchain technologies have largely been used for speculative trading. But DeFi start-ups are trying to build an interlocking financial system denominated in cryptocurrencies, offering a wide array of lending and derivatives products available globally, peer-to-peer and without any middlemen. The movement has gathered steam in 2019, with investment from mainstream investors such as Andreessen Horowitz and Bain Capital Ventures. Even former UK chancellor George Osborne has shown support as a partner at his brother Theo Osborne’s venture capital group 9Yards Capital, which backs several DeFi start-ups. “2019 will be known as the year of DeFi for crypto,” said Monica Desai, an investor at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins. “Some of the best talent in the space right now is in DeFi. And because they’re seeing usage, more people are building there.” But DeFi is still nascent, freewheeling and largely unregulated. Most companies have only debuted their initial products in the past year, and total assets have yet to exceed $1bn. Meanwhile, critics warn that the sector’s technological limitations and untested economics may not work when handling larger transaction volumes. “\\[DeFi\\] is a sign of things to come and a super interesting sandbox,” said Simon Taylor, a former Barclays vice-president and co-founder at financial technology consultancy 11:FS. “\\[But\\] it’s both very dangerous and the Wild West.” What is DeFi? DeFi first gained traction in late 2018 as an umbrella term for a loose collection of blockchain projects focused on eradicating any human involvement from financial services. For proponents, this promises a faster, more inclusive and transparent financial system. The movement encompasses “decentralised” exchanges and lending platforms, for example. Here there is no reliance on a central intermediary to hold funds — instead, trades and loans occur directly between participants through automated processes. “Over time you have the ability for anyone to be able to access savings accounts, to be able to access loans and to earn income in a steady currency that is not tied to wherever they live,” said Ms Desai. The applications operate on blockchains, the immutable public ledgers that record transactions in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Most are built on the Ethereum blockchain because it can be used to create smart contracts — essentially computer code that is automatically triggered when certain conditions are met. Ether, the related currency, is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation behind bitcoin, trading at about $130. But several other protocols, such as Tezos, Algorand and Dfinity, are also developing with a view to support DeFi applications. Who are the key players? While the amount of money locked in DeFi products is relatively small — about $700m, according to data compiled by DeFi Pulse — it has nearly tripled this year, with outsize yields and a wave of new initiatives helping to propel growth. DeFi Prime, a website tracking the sector, counts more than 200 related projects offering everything from prediction markets to margin trading. The most popular applications have focused on peer-to-peer lending markets underpinned by stablecoins, cryptocurrencies that are largely pegged to fiat currencies such as the US dollar. In the case of Compound, the largest of the lending platforms, stablecoin holders supply their assets to a “liquidity pool” from which borrowers can pull. Compound’s algorithm, or “protocol”, automatically sets interest rates based on supply and demand. The transactions occur continuously, so lenders earn frequent but fluctuating interest. For their part, borrowers must pledge more collateral, in the form of other cryptoassets, than the value of their loan, providing extra protection to the system in case of default. Compound says it has more than $120m earning interest on its app. “When demand to borrow an asset is super high, the interest rate is high, and when demand to borrow an asset is low, the interest rate is low,” said Robert Leshner, founder of Compound, which raised more than $24m in a fundraising round led by Andreessen Horowitz in September. Maker DAO, which is responsible for the Dai stablecoin, is another well-known project. Billed as “the world’s first unbiased currency”, users obtain Dai by opening a so-called collateralised debt position with Maker, which provides the tokens as a form of debt backed by Ether and a growing list of other cryptocurrencies. Dai holders have locked nearly $350m in Maker’s protocol, according to DeFi Pulse, more than any other similar application, although the project has been plagued by infighting. How lucrative is it? Like other speculative ventures, DeFi start-ups have focused on building their technologies and user bases rather than profitability. This means low fees, together with chunky yields, have proven a draw to the space for users. “What is happening more and more in DeFi is not wild speculation but saving dollars with handsome return and relatively limited risk,” said Brendan Forster, chief operating officer of Dharma, which acts as a digital bank depositing user assets on the Compound protocol. But this could change in future. Dharma does not charge anything to users, though Mr Forster said the company would probably introduce fees next year. Compound collects upward of 10 per cent of the interest charged to borrowers on its application, which it sets aside as reserves. Some worry that diminishing interest rates — as more users flood the space — may not sufficiently compensate investors for the risks of the platform. “One of the big questions that hangs over DeFi is the sustainability of the economic returns for participants lending your crypto,” said Garrick Hileman, an academic and head of research at Blockchain.com, a cryptocurrency wallet company. How likely is it to revolutionise finance? It is too early to tell, though early adopters are predictably bullish on DeFi’s long-term prospects. “In 50 years, I can’t see us still relying on trusted intermediaries to do settlement of \\[foreign exchange\\] transactions,” Mr Forster said. “It doesn’t make sense . . . Why use humans when we have code that can do it perfectly?” But even some advocates acknowledge DeFi is highly experimental and exists in a regulatory grey zone. “It’s not ready for mainstream use and it’s not ready for human consumption . . . This early phase is really for researchers, professionals, very sophisticated speculators,” said Mr Leshner, adding that he believed DeFi would become a mainstream technology over the next decade. There are also practical barriers to widespread adoption. Ms Desai noted that users must first purchase existing cryptocurrencies such as Ether to access DeFi products, adding that the “tax regimes are confusing”. And as with elsewhere in the cryptocurrency sphere, there are risks of scams. “This in some ways has echoes of the peer-to-peer lending space \\[and\\] there’s some challenges in that space that might be instructive,” said Mr Hileman, pointing to the Chinese P2P lending industry crisis, where a spate of fraud and negligence cases has shocked investors in recent years. “In 2020, it will still be ill-defined and overhyped,” said Tim Swanson, director of research at Post Oak Labs. “Regulators will increasingly learn about how in many case DeFi is often basically non-compliant . . . with anti-money laundering and know your customer rules.” Some have also pointed to systemic risks. The initiatives all rely on the protocol that they are built on, such as Ethereum, which has faced early stumbles as it begins to handle larger transaction volumes. They are also tied to the cryptocurrencies that fuel those protocols — which remain vulnerable to price swings. “You need to solve the underlying technology problems that protocols have so that people can safely deploy those decentralised applications,” said Steve Kokinos, chief executive of smart contract protocol Algorand. Meanwhile, DeFi’s economics have not been tested at scale. And without human intermediaries overseeing transaction settlement, users must fully trust the software, meaning any glitches could fully upend the system. “What excites me is where we could be if most products could be built without requiring the paper \\[and\\] expensive legacy tech banks do,” said Mr Taylor at 11:FS. “Anyone could build financial products. It doesn’t mean anyone should.”", "timestamp": 1633840088, "digest": "4ezuZt4pFY3v8v1eUjHL2aaabxMUEGdLYFMZewi7OVQ", "contributor": "0x1f04ed7308c91ecc07d52AEf0d862A5bb8c6a86B"}

Welles Wilder, is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. The RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally the RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30. Signals can be generated by looking for divergences and failure swings. RSI can also be used to identify the general trend.\n\n### How this indicator works\n\n* RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30. These traditional levels can also be adjusted if necessary to better fit the security. For example, if a security is repeatedly reaching the overbought level of 70 you may want to adjust this level to 80.\n\n  Note: During strong trends, the RSI may remain in overbought or oversold for extended periods.\n* RSI also often forms chart patterns that may not show on the underlying price chart, such as double tops and bottoms and trend lines. Also, look for support or resistance on the RSI.\n* In an uptrend or bull market, the RSI tends to remain in the 40 to 90 range with the 40-50 zone acting as support. During a downtrend or bear market the RSI tends to stay between the 10 to 60 range with the 50-60 zone acting as resistance. These ranges will vary depending on the RSI settings and the strength of the security’s or market’s underlying trend.\n* If underlying prices make a new high or low that isn't confirmed by the RSI, this divergence can signal a price reversal. If the RSI makes a lower high and then follows with a downside move below a previous low, a Top Swing Failure has occurred. If the RSI makes a higher low and then follows with an upside move above a previous high, a Bottom Swing Failure has occurred.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EymvL8Jx3ynGXtnp2tflO.png?height=345&width=602)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633839951, "digest": "zRqBP6MAWs2_nUmq0bv8tpTmPIJ74QuamyNMv44Bc1g", "contributor": "0x05f82dB14B9EBAA88E8420fc5fb8896345177F8D"}

More specifically, DeFi refers to a system by which software written on blockchains makes it possible for buyers, sellers, lenders, and borrowers to interact peer to peer or with a strictly software-based middleman rather than a company or institution facilitating a transaction.\n\nMultiple technologies and protocols are used to achieve the goal of decentralization.

Inside the Briefing Room of the  UAE-US joint military operation.***\n\nAs soon as the US military personnel from different task forces, such as counter-terrorism, military intelligence, and others including Eagle-One and Eagle-Two, waited for half an hour inside the Briefing Room, the US military high-rank officers finally arrived. That night, General Perry also attended the unscheduled military briefing and was not informed upon his sudden arrival. Everyone was surprised because before a high-rank military officer arrives, an officer in charge usually announces to every person in the room to stand and gives their military salute. To see a military general suddenly enters the briefing room makes every military personnel who attends the briefing spontaneously stand up and gives their military salute.\n\nGeneral Perry: “At ease, gentlemen, I know this briefing is unscheduled but, we don't have much time. Washington has recently announced DEFCON 3 and with possible DEFCON 2 in a couple of hours. We currently have a crisis everywhere around the globe that somehow started 8 to 6 hours ago. Now, Russia, China, and Europe, and many other countries are reporting the same cases. We don't know what it is yet since it spreads fast and currently is beyond our ability to contain it. So far, it is known as a very deadly virus which I don't like saying about it, but after the patient's heartbeat stop, mmmm, somehow it started to walk with no heartbeat and attack other human beings.\"\n\nThe briefing room suddenly turned panic and tumultuous because not only did they think the general information was impossible to believe, but none of them knew or were informed about it in the past 6 to 4 hours ago of what happens.\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Order!...Order!... Listen! I know you are all surprised, but so did I, and right this minute, it is still happening and emerging everywhere around the world. For your information, just now, Dubai city is lockdown since a mist has also started to appear. The UAE military is now in full-scale operation to take necessary measures, so it will not spread beyond the city limit because more cases are beginning to appear. A recent report said that the escalation has turned chaotic near Dubai Marina and downtown.\"\n\nDavis begins to panic but is still in disbelieve after hearing the explanation. He starts commenting with the hope General Perry is merely joking around at the end of the year, \"General! I just talked to my wife and son half an hour ago, and they did not say any goddamn thing about what you have just said.\"\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Everyone! Please turn on your mobile phone now and call your family or anyone you know back home.\"\n\nWithout delay, everyone starts turning on their mobile phone, including Davis and Monk. The briefing room turns silent as everyone is anxious to call their family back home. Once they tried, most of them got an auto-response from the mobile phone operator: (\"The number you are calling is not active, or out of coverage area, please try again in a few minutes.\")\n\nOne of the personnel says, \"Hey, why it says my wife's phone is not active?\" Then, another personnel also reported the same thing, followed by the same result from almost all personnel in the room. Monk and Davis also got the same notification, and now they began to worry.\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Listen, officers! Every major phone operator starting from US West Coast to Central suddenly disconnected... Not only that, but the last report from Washington said that all electricity in that region is failing one by one, and every major city is in total blackout. We need to go home now! I am here to announce that all of you will receive a new task, starting now!\"\n\n## CHAPTER TWENTY SIX\n\n### The first outbreak\n\n![(Illustration 29)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lPvsEzbrgHEjC941BJOZm.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***02:00. Dubai, The Briefing Room.***\n\nInside the Briefing Room, General Perry requests every special forces' personnel to stay calm and focus on the present situation since whatever they want to do right away is hardly possible because firstly, they are thousands of miles away from home. Secondly, their country needs their services more than ever before. Thirdly, as the general speaks, the East and the southern coastal states in the US have fallen into chaos.\n\nAccording to General Perry, intel source last transmission from New York said that the first patient or patient zero arrived in New York Harbour several hours earlier on a cargo vessel. He was one of the crews of that vessel. The captain put him on a quarantine on board after he was showing symptoms of contagious illness.\n\nThe captain log shows that the first symptom of patient zero was losing his appetite to eat and drink. Several hours later, the patient experiencing a high fever and followed by a terrible headache. The patient started to lose part of his teeth. A dark purple and itchy rashes began to appear throughout his skin. The patient is showing abnormal behavior and resists staying calm as the color of his eyes is changing to yellowish red.\n\nBy the time the cargo vessel arrived at New York Harbour, every crew on board, as well as the captain has shown similar symptoms like patient zero. Everyone was quarantine, but two of the vessel crew were missing, and the CDC assumed they jumped overboard when the cargo ship entered New York Harbour.\n\nWhat was strange is when the CDC took a heartbeat test from patient zero, but the patient got no heartbeat at all, yet he was still moving around, groaning, and new sharp teeth were growing inside the mouth. The CDC report was frightening since they have concluded that patient zero has died but somehow still 'alive' and turned to behave like a wild animal.\n\nIn less than an hour, another police report came in from a shopping mall near the harbor, and less than an hour later, more police reports came in. New York City was immediately put on lockdown by the CDC with the help of the police, but the spread was beyond their capability to contain as the cops started to have the same illness. In just 4 hours, the sickness spreads like wildfire.\n\nAt the same time, a similar CDC report came in from Miami, Florida, Boston, and Washington DC in just six hours, the Eastern and South coastal part of the US with all its population was declared ill, and they must remain indoors.\n\n![(Illustration 30)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s_dkJFErUEChQ3Yeg0aW3.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\nAs the virus outbreak started inland, people reported seeing a mist. It turns denser in vast populated areas within the city limit, and it keeps expanding in just a short time, and then the mist starts covering most populated areas. Numerous reports came in from people who were trapped inside the mist. The report stated they required immediate help because they heard horrifying screams, and people began seeing monster-like creatures. Police sent SWAT teams to rescue them, but none have returned from inside the mist, including the SWAT teams.\n\nGeneral Perry concluded his preliminary report to the officers in the briefing room by stating that many US states on the East Coast have become chaotic in less than 6 hours since the first CDC report of patient zero and could spread to the West Coast. Until now, the CDC has no clue about what is happening since there is probably a cyberattack on US power plants and telecommunication services.\n\nGeneral Perry: \"I don't know what is going on right now, but the virus is spreading fast, and I recently lost contact with the Pentagon, the UN, and several military bases 2,5 hours ago. We need to go home right now and make sure that the virus is not spreading to the West Coast.!\"\n\n## CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN\n\n### Undead: the 'dead living’ state of being\n\n![(Illustration 31)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DugHjzj5ltGR_uQ0hOcyk.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***02:30. Dubai, The Briefing Room.***\n\nAfter General Perry gives a brief chronological explanation of how the outbreak began, he gave 20 minutes for a team of scientists who came along with him to explain further what they will be dealing with later? Although it seems too early to conclude what is going on or what had happened to patient zero, somehow, General Perry wants to make sure every information he has about the virus or patient zero is brief to the personnel.\n\nAs soon as General Perry finished with his opening session, two civilians scientists and a doctor from CDC, but worked covertly for the Department of Defence (DoD) from the military intelligence division to take over the Briefing Room. They want to explain further their findings of the illness and are not limited to the symptoms of the virus.\n\nDue to their covert assignments inside the US government, they started the second session without mentioning their real names to the rest of the military personnel. Instead, they will introduce themselves only by their nickname or call sign. The first scientist is a young woman. So she opens the second session by introducing herself and her field of operation.\n\nThe first scientist: \"Hi, I am Hydra. I work for DoD and specialize in biowarfare.\"\n\nThen the second scientist who is a young man steps forward,\n\nThe second scientist: \"Hi, I am Spartacus. I work for DoD and specialize in quantum physics.\"\n\nAfter that, the third person is a doctor.\n\nThe doctor: \"Hello, I am Doctor Jim. I work for DoD and I specialize in human bones.\"\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Thank you, everyone. Hydra, you first.\"\n\nHydra: \"Thank you, General. Okay. So, let's start since we are running out of time. First of all, I will say it straight forward that we are not dealing with a living being, or at least not outwardly. So far, we have known that patient zero was already dead while he was still on the cargo vessel. And maybe even before the ship reached the New York Harbor.\n\nAt that time, the Captain and the crew think he probably fainted or was asleep but, he died because of the deadly virus, perhaps somewhere right after his teeth fell out, and then he began the abnormal state, which was actually postmortem. I know you probably think he is a zombie? Well, it's true and false because at least not the kind of zombie that we know from movies, but this is the zombie.\n\nPerhaps, I will call patient zero an inverted \"dead-living\" being or an undead. Dead but not entirely. It's living but not alive.\n\nAfter patient zero arrived at CDC New York, we were 100% sure that there was no heartbeat in him, yet he still moved around and became hostile like wild animals towards other living beings. We all decided to put him to rest permanently by cutting the nervous system from the brain to the spinal cord. As I was conducting the autopsy, I found out that everything inside his body was slowly inverting. The inside becomes the outside while the outside becomes the inside.\n\nAlthough the inversion is not spontaneous but slow in progress, I can see parts of his lungs, heart, liver, digestive system, and other organs are changing. In ordinary postmortem cases, the human organs will start decaying, but in the case of patient zero, the decaying process only happens outwardly and not internally.\n\nI know it sounds weird or confusing, but we all have genes similar to plants and animals.\n\nAll I can say right now, the outward form of patient zero is merely like leaves. It grew and died, but as long as the root has not died, wherein the case of patient zero was at the spinal cord and the brain, then the internal parts of his organ will keep slowly inverting, the new cell tissue is produced from the previous decaying cell tissues. So, it did not generate a healthy tissue but a decayed one.\n\nAlthough I don't have time to check further on this matter because of the outbreak, I believe the abnormal activity from patient zero that looks like a post mortem desire to eat a living flesh was somehow to compensate the decaying cell tissues that it has.\n\nI don't know what kind of virus can trigger such inversions. But according to my research as a biowarfare specialist, this virus is certainly not natural or made either, at least not from our living environment.\n\nThank you and I will let Spartacus explain further.\n\nDavis, Monk, and everyone inside the briefing room were speechless. They hope there can be immediate action to stop the spread of the virus. They worried sick about their families. Inside the briefing room, everyone is deeply emotional, just like what happened to the rest of the world. Strangely, unlike the rest of the world, the personnel are not infected by the virus.\n\n## CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT\n\n### The inverted bones\n\n![(Illustration 32)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bom_vBMTVbGCYxZ0O5Ddb.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***02:37. Dubai, The Briefing Room.***\n\nRight after Hydra asks Spartacus to speak next, suddenly the General wants Doctor Jim to be the next speaker to brief the officers.\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Hydra, I would like Doctor Jim to speak next since it is related to a human biological subject.”\n\nHydra: \"As you see fit, General Perry. Doctor Jim, please.\"\n\nDoctor Jim: \"Thank you, General Perry, and also Hydra. Okay, so I guess I better start this session right away. In percentage, our bone's weight is only about 3-5% compared to our total body weight. It is relatively small, but bones are the basic structure of our human form. Without bones, we lose our physical shape, and in the end, we lose our form. Somehow, if there is a constant radical change inside the bones, it will ultimately change the shape. As you have known, our bone is a living tissue organism, just like a tree trunk.\n\nA tree trunk grows from the root while the root lies beneath the soil. It is also the same with us, humans. The source of our bone's growth lies at the end of our spine, where it all first started to grow ever since a human still inside a female womb.\n\nThe root of a tree looks the same as any other tree, but how it differs from this type of tree or, that type of tree comes from how the root's components are structured.\n\nIn short, normal human bone comes from collagen and calcium.

That is why we named patient zero a shamble being. Everything inside him, or it, is going through a state of inversion. It becomes a disorder if compared to ours. It is slow but progressive.\n\nMy assumption, at this moment, is that the virus attacked the bond of the protein, which then forms a new bone and then radically changes the structural components. Technically, this virus is rewriting the signature of the new bones to other elements, which made the bones not composed mainly of Calcium but rather mmmm something else.\n\nRight now, we still don't know what it is or where it comes from since it is not an earthly origin, or perhaps I should say as Hydra had said... natural environment.\"\n\nEvery officer inside the briefing room was pondered by what Doctor Jim had just said, and the briefing room started to become noisy.\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Order!

She begins to make a weird face at Diana as if she is telling Diana without saying any words that she had to do it. Diana responded by smiling at Catherine, as if she is telling Catherine without saying a word either, \"Hey, it's your neighbor, not mine.\"\n\nOnce Catherine finally sits inside Diana's car, she sighs. Diana looks at her, and she can not hide it anymore and starts laughing, although Diana is curious about the conversation between Catherine and Mrs. Abigail.\n\nAs Diana starts her car and is ready to drive away from Catherine's apartment, she asks Catherine, “I am so sorry I laugh, Catherine. What is it with you today, and why did you sigh after accidentally met your senior neighbor?\"\n\nCatherine looks at Diana also with a curious smile because she knows Diana is phishing her by throwing a question, then all of a sudden, she laughs. But out of the blue, Mike sitting beside Alice at the rear says something that makes Catherine and Diana laugh even more.\n\nMike: \"Mommy misses Daddy. She had a bad dream, then she cried, but now she is laughing.\"\n\nDiana and Catherine were surprised by what Mike just said, and they both looking at Mike, then Catherine says \"Okay, Mr. Windbag, could you please stop telling mommy's secret to Aunt Diana.\"\n\nMike did not answer and started laughing. Alice does not understand what happened but somehow tickles by the sound of Mike's laugh, and she also starts laughing following Mike.\n\nPerhaps it is nice to begin their trip to the supercenter on that unexpected fine afternoon day for everyone to laugh. Well, at least while they all still can.\n\nCatherine: \"Diana, let's go, I am bored.\"\n\nDiana: \"Shopping is the best way to get the ladies' mood to get back on track!\"\n\nAs they all drove away from Catherine's apartment with Diana's car, Mike raised his voice and says, \"Mommy, is Aunt Rosa!\"\n\nCatherine opens the side window, then Diana and Catherine wave at Rosa. She is wearing a nurse's dress and talking on her mobile phone while holding a small plastic medicine bag in her left hand.\n\nDiana and Catherine simultaneously shout to Rosa from the car and say, “Rosa! Que tenga un lindo día.\"\n\nRosa was caught in surprise as she was still having a conversation with her office when she heard the two women shout at her from a car. As Rosa sees is Catherine and Diana with their children, Rosa smiles and waves to them.

Inside the Briefing Room of the  UAE-US joint military operation.***\n\nAs soon as the US military personnel from different task forces, such as counter-terrorism, military intelligence, and others including Eagle-One and Eagle-Two, waited for half an hour inside the Briefing Room, the US military high-rank officers finally arrived. That night, General Perry also attended the unscheduled military briefing and was not informed upon his sudden arrival. Everyone was surprised because before a high-rank military officer arrives, an officer in charge usually announces to every person in the room to stand and gives their military salute. To see a military general suddenly enters the briefing room makes every military personnel who attends the briefing spontaneously stand up and gives their military salute.\n\nGeneral Perry: “At ease, gentlemen, I know this briefing is unscheduled but, we don't have much time. Washington has recently announced DEFCON 3 and with possible DEFCON 2 in a couple of hours. We currently have a crisis everywhere around the globe that somehow started 8 to 6 hours ago. Now, Russia, China, and Europe, and many other countries are reporting the same cases. We don't know what it is yet since it spreads fast and currently is beyond our ability to contain it. So far, it is known as a very deadly virus which I don't like saying about it, but after the patient's heartbeat stop, mmmm, somehow it started to walk with no heartbeat and attack other human beings.\"\n\nThe briefing room suddenly turned panic and tumultuous because not only did they think the general information was impossible to believe, but none of them knew or were informed about it in the past 6 to 4 hours ago of what happens.\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Order!...Order!... Listen! I know you are all surprised, but so did I, and right this minute, it is still happening and emerging everywhere around the world. For your information, just now, Dubai city is lockdown since a mist has also started to appear. The UAE military is now in full-scale operation to take necessary measures, so it will not spread beyond the city limit because more cases are beginning to appear. A recent report said that the escalation has turned chaotic near Dubai Marina and downtown.\"\n\nDavis begins to panic but is still in disbelieve after hearing the explanation. He starts commenting with the hope General Perry is merely joking around at the end of the year, \"General! I just talked to my wife and son half an hour ago, and they did not say any goddamn thing about what you have just said.\"\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Everyone! Please turn on your mobile phone now and call your family or anyone you know back home.\"\n\nWithout delay, everyone starts turning on their mobile phone, including Davis and Monk. The briefing room turns silent as everyone is anxious to call their family back home. Once they tried, most of them got an auto-response from the mobile phone operator: (\"The number you are calling is not active, or out of coverage area, please try again in a few minutes.\")\n\nOne of the personnel says, \"Hey, why it says my wife's phone is not active?\" Then, another personnel also reported the same thing, followed by the same result from almost all personnel in the room. Monk and Davis also got the same notification, and now they began to worry.\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Listen, officers! Every major phone operator starting from US West Coast to Central suddenly disconnected... Not only that, but the last report from Washington said that all electricity in that region is failing one by one, and every major city is in total blackout. We need to go home now! I am here to announce that all of you will receive a new task, starting now!\"\n\n## CHAPTER TWENTY SIX\n\n### The first outbreak\n\n![(Illustration 29)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lPvsEzbrgHEjC941BJOZm.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***02:00. Dubai, The Briefing Room.***\n\nInside the Briefing Room, General Perry requests every special forces' personnel to stay calm and focus on the present situation since whatever they want to do right away is hardly possible because firstly, they are thousands of miles away from home. Secondly, their country needs their services more than ever before. Thirdly, as the general speaks, the East and the southern coastal states in the US have fallen into chaos.\n\nAccording to General Perry, intel source last transmission from New York said that the first patient or patient zero arrived in New York Harbour several hours earlier on a cargo vessel. He was one of the crews of that vessel. The captain put him on a quarantine on board after he was showing symptoms of contagious illness.\n\nThe captain log shows that the first symptom of patient zero was losing his appetite to eat and drink. Several hours later, the patient experiencing a high fever and followed by a terrible headache. The patient started to lose part of his teeth. A dark purple and itchy rashes began to appear throughout his skin. The patient is showing abnormal behavior and resists staying calm as the color of his eyes is changing to yellowish red.\n\nBy the time the cargo vessel arrived at New York Harbour, every crew on board, as well as the captain has shown similar symptoms like patient zero. Everyone was quarantine, but two of the vessel crew were missing, and the CDC assumed they jumped overboard when the cargo ship entered New York Harbour.\n\nWhat was strange is when the CDC took a heartbeat test from patient zero, but the patient got no heartbeat at all, yet he was still moving around, groaning, and new sharp teeth were growing inside the mouth. The CDC report was frightening since they have concluded that patient zero has died but somehow still 'alive' and turned to behave like a wild animal.\n\nIn less than an hour, another police report came in from a shopping mall near the harbor, and less than an hour later, more police reports came in. New York City was immediately put on lockdown by the CDC with the help of the police, but the spread was beyond their capability to contain as the cops started to have the same illness. In just 4 hours, the sickness spreads like wildfire.\n\nAt the same time, a similar CDC report came in from Miami, Florida, Boston, and Washington DC in just six hours, the Eastern and South coastal part of the US with all its population was declared ill, and they must remain indoors.\n\n![(Illustration 30)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s_dkJFErUEChQ3Yeg0aW3.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\nAs the virus outbreak started inland, people reported seeing a mist. It turns denser in vast populated areas within the city limit, and it keeps expanding in just a short time, and then the mist starts covering most populated areas. Numerous reports came in from people who were trapped inside the mist. The report stated they required immediate help because they heard horrifying screams, and people began seeing monster-like creatures. Police sent SWAT teams to rescue them, but none have returned from inside the mist, including the SWAT teams.\n\nGeneral Perry concluded his preliminary report to the officers in the briefing room by stating that many US states on the East Coast have become chaotic in less than 6 hours since the first CDC report of patient zero and could spread to the West Coast. Until now, the CDC has no clue about what is happening since there is probably a cyberattack on US power plants and telecommunication services.\n\nGeneral Perry: \"I don't know what is going on right now, but the virus is spreading fast, and I recently lost contact with the Pentagon, the UN, and several military bases 2,5 hours ago. We need to go home right now and make sure that the virus is not spreading to the West Coast.!\"\n\n## CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN\n\n### Undead: the 'dead living’ state of being\n\n![(Illustration 31)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DugHjzj5ltGR_uQ0hOcyk.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***02:30. Dubai, The Briefing Room.***\n\nAfter General Perry gives a brief chronological explanation of how the outbreak began, he gave 20 minutes for a team of scientists who came along with him to explain further what they will be dealing with later? Although it seems too early to conclude what is going on or what had happened to patient zero, somehow, General Perry wants to make sure every information he has about the virus or patient zero is brief to the personnel.\n\nAs soon as General Perry finished with his opening session, two civilians scientists and a doctor from CDC, but worked covertly for the Department of Defence (DoD) from the military intelligence division to take over the Briefing Room. They want to explain further their findings of the illness and are not limited to the symptoms of the virus.\n\nDue to their covert assignments inside the US government, they started the second session without mentioning their real names to the rest of the military personnel. Instead, they will introduce themselves only by their nickname or call sign. The first scientist is a young woman. So she opens the second session by introducing herself and her field of operation.\n\nThe first scientist: \"Hi, I am Hydra. I work for DoD and specialize in biowarfare.\"\n\nThen the second scientist who is a young man steps forward,\n\nThe second scientist: \"Hi, I am Spartacus. I work for DoD and specialize in quantum physics.\"\n\nAfter that, the third person is a doctor.\n\nThe doctor: \"Hello, I am Doctor Jim. I work for DoD and I specialize in human bones.\"\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Thank you, everyone. Hydra, you first.\"\n\nHydra: \"Thank you, General. Okay. So, let's start since we are running out of time. First of all, I will say it straight forward that we are not dealing with a living being, or at least not outwardly. So far, we have known that patient zero was already dead while he was still on the cargo vessel. And maybe even before the ship reached the New York Harbor.\n\nAt that time, the Captain and the crew think he probably fainted or was asleep but, he died because of the deadly virus, perhaps somewhere right after his teeth fell out, and then he began the abnormal state, which was actually postmortem. I know you probably think he is a zombie? Well, it's true and false because at least not the kind of zombie that we know from movies, but this is the zombie.\n\nPerhaps, I will call patient zero an inverted \"dead-living\" being or an undead. Dead but not entirely. It's living but not alive.\n\nAfter patient zero arrived at CDC New York, we were 100% sure that there was no heartbeat in him, yet he still moved around and became hostile like wild animals towards other living beings. We all decided to put him to rest permanently by cutting the nervous system from the brain to the spinal cord. As I was conducting the autopsy, I found out that everything inside his body was slowly inverting. The inside becomes the outside while the outside becomes the inside.\n\nAlthough the inversion is not spontaneous but slow in progress, I can see parts of his lungs, heart, liver, digestive system, and other organs are changing. In ordinary postmortem cases, the human organs will start decaying, but in the case of patient zero, the decaying process only happens outwardly and not internally.\n\nI know it sounds weird or confusing, but we all have genes similar to plants and animals.\n\nAll I can say right now, the outward form of patient zero is merely like leaves. It grew and died, but as long as the root has not died, wherein the case of patient zero was at the spinal cord and the brain, then the internal parts of his organ will keep slowly inverting, the new cell tissue is produced from the previous decaying cell tissues. So, it did not generate a healthy tissue but a decayed one.\n\nAlthough I don't have time to check further on this matter because of the outbreak, I believe the abnormal activity from patient zero that looks like a post mortem desire to eat a living flesh was somehow to compensate the decaying cell tissues that it has.\n\nI don't know what kind of virus can trigger such inversions. But according to my research as a biowarfare specialist, this virus is certainly not natural or made either, at least not from our living environment.\n\nThank you and I will let Spartacus explain further.\n\nDavis, Monk, and everyone inside the briefing room were speechless. They hope there can be immediate action to stop the spread of the virus. They worried sick about their families. Inside the briefing room, everyone is deeply emotional, just like what happened to the rest of the world. Strangely, unlike the rest of the world, the personnel are not infected by the virus.\n\n## CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT\n\n### The inverted bones\n\n![(Illustration 32)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bom_vBMTVbGCYxZ0O5Ddb.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***02:37. Dubai, The Briefing Room.***\n\nRight after Hydra asks Spartacus to speak next, suddenly the General wants Doctor Jim to be the next speaker to brief the officers.\n\nGeneral Perry: \"Hydra, I would like Doctor Jim to speak next since it is related to a human biological subject.”\n\nHydra: \"As you see fit, General Perry. Doctor Jim, please.\"\n\nDoctor Jim: \"Thank you, General Perry, and also Hydra. Okay, so I guess I better start this session right away. In percentage, our bone's weight is only about 3-5% compared to our total body weight. It is relatively small, but bones are the basic structure of our human form. Without bones, we lose our physical shape, and in the end, we lose our form. Somehow, if there is a constant radical change inside the bones, it will ultimately change the shape. As you have known, our bone is a living tissue organism, just like a tree trunk.\n\nA tree trunk grows from the root while the root lies beneath the soil. It is also the same with us, humans.

She begins to make a weird face at Diana as if she is telling Diana without saying any words that she had to do it. Diana responded by smiling at Catherine, as if she is telling Catherine without saying a word either, \"Hey, it's your neighbor, not mine.\"\n\nOnce Catherine finally sits inside Diana's car, she sighs. Diana looks at her, and she can not hide it anymore and starts laughing, although Diana is curious about the conversation between Catherine and Mrs. Abigail.\n\nAs Diana starts her car and is ready to drive away from Catherine's apartment, she asks Catherine, “I am so sorry I laugh, Catherine. What is it with you today, and why did you sigh after accidentally met your senior neighbor?\"\n\nCatherine looks at Diana also with a curious smile because she knows Diana is phishing her by throwing a question, then all of a sudden, she laughs. But out of the blue, Mike sitting beside Alice at the rear says something that makes Catherine and Diana laugh even more.\n\nMike: \"Mommy misses Daddy. She had a bad dream, then she cried, but now she is laughing.\"\n\nDiana and Catherine were surprised by what Mike just said, and they both looking at Mike, then Catherine says \"Okay, Mr. Windbag, could you please stop telling mommy's secret to Aunt Diana.\"\n\nMike did not answer and started laughing. Alice does not understand what happened but somehow tickles by the sound of Mike's laugh, and she also starts laughing following Mike.\n\nPerhaps it is nice to begin their trip to the supercenter on that unexpected fine afternoon day for everyone to laugh. Well, at least while they all still can.\n\nCatherine: \"Diana, let's go, I am bored.\"\n\nDiana: \"Shopping is the best way to get the ladies' mood to get back on track!\"\n\nAs they all drove away from Catherine's apartment with Diana's car, Mike raised his voice and says, \"Mommy, is Aunt Rosa!\"\n\nCatherine opens the side window, then Diana and Catherine wave at Rosa. She is wearing a nurse's dress and talking on her mobile phone while holding a small plastic medicine bag in her left hand.\n\nDiana and Catherine simultaneously shout to Rosa from the car and say, “Rosa! Que tenga un lindo día.\"\n\nRosa was caught in surprise as she was still having a conversation with her office when she heard the two women shout at her from a car. As Rosa sees is Catherine and Diana with their children, Rosa smiles and waves to them. She shouts, \"*Mantente a salvo, hermosas damas.*\"\n\nAfter they greet Rosa nearby the main apartment's complex gate, the car turns to the main street and heads straight to the city of Albuquerque.\n\n**(To be continued)**", "timestamp": 1633842634, "digest": "YUhJFO0K-epPdkAnyH9CR4Reop0JcvhcFlG21B4LQUk", "contributor": "0xc1C41e3606bF2756c09c95132F528012be17f724"}

"```\n各位朋友们，大家好。作为一个在区块链行业工作的普通人，\n结合过去拥有的法律知识和实践经验，作为在Mirror平台的第一篇文章，\n想和大家分享关于区块链以及分散式金融（DeFi）背后的含义，法律背后的含义，\n以及未来如果要规制区块链的话，可能被采取的规制等一些问题的看法\n（在中国大陆地区已经禁止加密货币交易的前提下，\n我们重要会讨论美国等地区的规制问题）。\n希望各位朋友可以共同探讨，\n期待这个区块链这个圈子可以带领我们走向更加美好的未来。\n```\n\n## 第一部分 区块链以及分散式金融的本质\n\n```\n区块链本质是一种分布式的数据库。密码学技术，帮助我们实现了如何安全的构架这种分布式数据库。而产生这种分布式数据库的原因在于，中央集权式的数据库本身的脆弱性，即中央数据库的损坏会导致整个系统的崩溃。我们希望，系统拥有一定的容错性，即在系统中部分节点出现问题，也不会造成整个系统的崩溃。这样，我们可以更加持久，更加放心的使用服务。而这背后的本质在于，我们不相信世界上存在永远牢不可破的中心节点，即对节点的非信任性。这里的节点，换到现实世界中，可以是指任何人，也可以是指任何机构。\n\n分散式金融是基于区块链技术形成的分布式金融系统。分散式金融当然的拥有区块链的特征，即金融系统的容错性。因此，分散式金融帮助我们实现了一些，现在金融系统无法实现，或者是很难实现的一些功能。例如，365\\*24的全天候服务，基于个人而非身份的平等服务，更加低廉的服务费用等。分散式金融的背后也和区块链技术同样，是一种对于节点的非信任性。\n\n 一直以来，信任是一种非常昂贵，以及难以维持的东西。你可能会被多年的朋友背叛，你也可能会被多年信赖的企业所欺骗。反过来说，一个朋友想要维持和你的信任，需要花费的时间和成本是无法计算的，同样一个企业想要获得消费者的信任也是需要花费无数的时间和金钱的。但是，毁掉这种信任，缺只需要一件事，或者一次违约而已。然而，区块链以及分散式金融就是这样一种，无需信赖的单个节点，而是可以信赖的系统。这背后，本质上是指信赖这个世界上大多数的人（或者说是50%以上的人）。如果我们并不信赖这个世界50%以上的人，恐怕任何人都难以在这个社会生存吧，因为缺乏信赖的生活，成本会非常高。信赖的好处正是，可以降低成本。这种成本可以是时间上的成本，也可以是金钱上的成本，甚至是情感上的成本。\n```\n\n## 第二部分 法律的本质\n\n```\n说到法律的本质，不得不让我会想起曾经的法理学和法哲学的老师的教导。有关于法律的探讨可能会晦涩难懂，我尽量说的通俗易懂一些。说到法律背后的含义，自然就会出现，实证法主义以及自然法主义这两种学派了。不过，从我们的感受上来看，法律应该更接近于自然法。毕竟，从法律的历史演变就可以看出，法律应该是基于大多数人的行为习惯以及思想而产生的一种集体价值观念的系统化。自古历来，人们对于穷凶极恶的罪犯就应当除以严刑的朴素价值观念，因此，现代刑法也对于故意杀人等犯罪处以最高死刑（或者是永久监禁，这里不涉及对于死刑制度的探讨）。\n\n但是，当人们发现，人人平等的情况下，没有人拥有制裁他人的权力，只有法律可以代替所有人去制裁他人。那法律如果是基于人的价值观念产生的话，也会因为人的价值观念而改变，这样的话，法律的稳定性就会被破坏。大多数人很难生活在，一个朝令夕改的社会中的，因为要花费的成本太高。如果法律本身就只是法律，不依照人的价值观念产生的话，自然不会有上述的问题。然而，恶法亦法的结果，会让大多数人难以接受，尤其是在战争爆发的时候。所以，法律回过头来，本质还是更接近于自然法的存在。\n\n可以看出，法律本质上也是一种系统，是基于对大多数人的信任的系统。大多数人的价值观念是值得信赖的，因此基于这种价值观念产生的法律也是可以信赖的。法律是制度上实现了这种信赖，而区块链则是从技术上实现了这种信赖。\n```\n\n## 第三部分 区块链与法律\n\n```\n区块链和法律从某种程度上都是实现了信赖的机制的话，那这两者的区别是什么。虽然有很多不同，但是我想说，最大的一点不同是，适用范围的不同。\n\n法律存在一种法域的概念，就是指法律可以使用的范围。虽然有属人，属地等原则，大多数的情况下，可以实现的法律是基于国家行政范围的。也就是说，法律的施行（司法）是基于国家的强制力，而国家的强制力是基于国家行政范围的。然而，区块链技术并没有这种实践意义上的范围限制。任何国家，任何人都可以使用区块链技术。也可以说（虽然很不准确），区块链从某种成度上实现了，对于参与的所有人的“法律“的创设（从定义上来讲，是不能称作法律的，仅从意义上有共通之处，因此加上了双引号）。而这种“法律”，可能是自然法的某种更加具体的表现。\n\n当然，区块链实现这种“法律”的代价是，只能规定最基本的规则，而不能拥有更加复杂，具体，和地域性的规则。而现代意义上的法律，司法的意义某种程度上要大于立法的意义。无法执行的法律，在人们心中很难认为是法律，哪怕立法是完美的。因此，法律必然需要，更加具体，更加可以执行，而且基于国家行政范围，也更加具有地域性。而这一切是和区块链的初衷是相反的（并不是不能实现，例如联盟链，私有链等。但是这种区块链，缺乏了第一部分说的这种信赖机制。）因此，通过现代法律实现对于区块链技术的管理，从本质上，可能就不是一个好的实践。因为，这两者都是基于同一种价值观念形成的，而难以相互制约。\n```\n\n## 第四部分 实践上可能对区块链实行的义务要求\n\n```\n实践上，国家对于区块链的规制的理由可以有很多，例如基于金融稳定，基于投资者保护等等。而大多数国家也会选择对于区块链进行规制。因为，技术如果没有法律的规制，自然也会危害到人自身，而且区块链技术的初衷无法实现更加具体的规则制定，因此就需要外部帮助区块链技术变得更及具体，哪怕这种实现会让区块链偏离本来的初衷。\n\n当然，如果法律实现了对于区块链技术的规制，带来的好处是，可以让更多的人，更大规模的机构参与进来，也加快了区块链技术普及的速度。接下来分析一下，区块链技术，特别是加密货币投资以及分散式金融的主战场美国，可能会制定的一些规则。首先，明确一点，金融相关法律的制定，在美国的原则就是投资者保护主义。而投资者保护主义的原因是，金融市场的参与者之间信息不对称。而弥补这种信息不对称的主要方式就是信息的公开披露。基于这些，我们从区块链业界中各种参与主体的角度来分析可能被要求遵守那些规则。\n```\n\n### 1）矿工（Miner）\n\n```\n矿工是区块链网络中最重要的参与者，以及利益获得者。矿工从技术上说，就是前文中所称的节点。他们具体的任务是，通过计算哈希函数打包区块，广播交易，确认区块，更新状态，即维持区块链网络的更新和运行。矿工通过上述行为，获得区块链奖励，即各种币。矿工和一般市场投资者最大的区别就是，打包交易的选择权。在无数等待打包的交易中，优先选择哪些交易处理（虽然有基于手续费的规则，但是矿工还是可以选择），甚至是拒绝打包某些地址的交易等权力是矿工独有的。如果，矿工利用这种权力，进行利益交换的话，就会出现市场的不公平。因此，矿工可能会被要求遵守的规则包括： 公开算力相关信息（机器类型，运行时间，版本型号，机器，电力，维护等成本等） 公开挖矿奖励相关信息（获得奖励的数量，时间，奖励变现方法，时间，金额等） 公开和上市公司相同的财务报表，重大利益关联等相关信息（资产负债表，现金流表，损益计算表等，股权结构，公司架构，利益相关方，利益相关行为等）\n```\n\n### 2）做市商（MarketMaker）\n\n```\n在加密货币市场，维持市场流动性的最大的参与者就是做市商。可以把币安（Binance），火币（HuobiGlobal），Coinbase等做市商看成是传统金融市场中的投资银行。矿工可以影响供给量，做市商可以影响价格。首先，做市场存在和一般投资者之间的直接的利益冲突问题。特别是在金融衍生品上，做市商对于价格波动的影响会非常大，而金融衍生品中，投资者亏的钱都是做市商的利润，因此对于金融衍生品交易的这部分，很大可能性，会被极其严格的规制。例如，杠杆倍数限制（防止市场波动导致做市商破产），100%甚至以上的保证金（信托管理），适格投资者限制（对于投资者的KYC，交易经验以及最低保证金限制等），所有业务总和的风险敞口控制（类似于银行的巴塞尔条约）等。其他的和矿工类似，财务报表，重大利益关联等相关信息的开示也很可能被要求。相比于矿工，做市商直接对接投资者，因此被要求的规则会更加严格。\n```\n\n### 3）托管机构（Custody）\n\n```\n托管机构，顾名思义就是帮助他人管理财产的机构。在加密货币的世界中，有很多有名的托管机构例如Bitgo等。他们负责安全的保存客户寄存在他们那里的加密货币资产。虽然加密货币本质上受到密码学自身的保护。但是，公钥和密钥的存在，必然会产生密钥泄露，被盗等危险。一直处于互联网连接状态的电脑本身就是不安全的这一事实，是需要每个投资者铭记在心的。因此托管机构利用各种软硬方法，实现客户资产的安全托管（包括但不限于冷钱包，多签等技术）。对于这类机构，由于他们管理着大量的资产，无论是从利益冲突上，还是技术安全上都应当对于他们要求极其高的义务。包括但不限于，客户资产和自有资产的分离管理，财务报表，重大利益关联等相关信息的公开，足额保证金（甚至是超额），危机处理方案等。\n```\n\n## 第五部分 区块链中特殊的参与者以及应当如何规制的问题\n\n```\n在区块链和分散式金融的世界中，例如Uniswap这样的自动做市商，例如AAVE这样的自动借贷服务，我们把这类完全由代码控制的金融服务成为分散式金融服务（DeFi）。同样，控制着这些服务的，不是某些大型机构或组织，而是由投资者，工程师等组成的分散性自律组织（DAO）。无论是DeFi还是DAO，他们也都是区块链世界的参与者。\n\n为何要单独拿出来这些参与者进行分析，原因在于他们和第四部分所讲是的参与者有着根本性的不同。根据第一部分和第二部分的讲述，可以认为，未来的金融应当是像区块链的初衷一样，基于区块链系统，而非单独节点，为更多的人提供更加便利廉价和可靠的服务。因此，当一种金融服务本身，不是由单独节点所管理控制的情况下，特别是当金融服务本身就是由投资者本人参与管理的情况下（例如DAO，但是对于分散度的讨论，需要单独一篇文章来分析），我们不应当要求这类金融服务以及他们的管理组织（DAO）履行和上述矿工，做市商和托管机构相同的信息公开义务。原因在于，他们与投资者之间并不存在市场信息的不对称，自然也就没有信息公开的义务，而且投资者和管理者一致的情况下，也不存在利益冲突。因此我认为不应当对于这类组织或服务采取过多的规则干涉，只要求最低限度的规则（例如：组织成员的公开，服务代码的公开，安全审计等）即可。\n\n但是有一个不得不讨论的问题就是对于分散式金融的用户是否进行以及如何进行KYC以及AML的验证。我们先要来考虑要求KYC和AML验证的原因。由于这个世界上并不是所有人都是把资金用于善意的行为，把资金用于犯罪行为，甚至是战争行为的个人和组织在这个世界上也存在着。虽然这类人和组织并不是占据大多数（50%以上），但是他们的行为的恶劣程度是会极大的损害这个世界上生存的其他个人和组织的利益（包括但不限于生命安全利益）。因此为了遏制这类行为的发生，最好的方法就是要求身份验证（KYC）以及反洗钱验证（AML）等。\n\n但是一旦进行了KYC和AML的认证，就会存在接下来的问题。这些数据由谁管理，无论是组织甚至是国家，都会是单节点管理。这些数据一旦被单节点控制，就会存在利用这些数据进行利益交换的问题（包括但不限于政治上经济上的利益）。对于这个问题，有一种解决方案是可以不需要两害之间取其轻的选择，就是分散式身份验证。（关于AML的解决方案，我们会在别的文章中讨论，因为涉及的问题较多）\n\nKYC验证要解决的一个问题就是“用户是谁”。然而只要我们可以特定某个地址背后的用户是一个人或者复数的人，或者一个组织（从管理账户的实际角度来说也是应该是一个或者复数的人），而且让这些数据以分布式的状态存在，这样就不会存在单节点控制的问题。但是会有人提出另一类问题，这样分布式存在的数据，会不会轻易的暴露个人隐私？\n\n答案是不会，因为分散式身份验证只能证明，这个地址的背后是特定的一个人，而且能知道这个人是和某些人有联系，而且这个人需要定期登录以证明自己是个真实存在的人。但是这个人的地址等详细情况并不会存在与分布式数据库中。当出现问题的时候，需要警方借助其他刑侦技术，从而确定这个人的确切住址等信息。我认为，这种成本是为了维持非单节点控制的必要成本。因为如果分散式金融只有服务本身是分散式的，而其相关联的所有服务都是单节点控制的话，这种服务本身是无法实现区块链的全部初衷的。\n```",

合成资产是什么？\n\n先简单介绍一下一下合成资产是什么，到底解决什么问题。\n\n1\\.跨链是什么？解决什么问题？\n\n首先让我们思考一个这样的问题：跨链究竟在做什么？为什么要跨链？\n\n相信很多人会迅速回答我的答案——打破部分链孤岛，部分链世界需要与其他世界的通信（画个大饼）是的，因为部分链存在孤岛问题，人们急迫的期待一个既所以，Polkadot，Cosmos等生态系统开始关注，直到现在，虽然仍然没有进展，但是上述项目在二级市场建立了自己的价值。\n\n浏览，跨链技术研发，究竟是公证人机制，侧链机制还是Polkadot的链发展+平行链+桥接链的模型都存在动态问题。\n\n任何原始去中心化，都太难了。\n\n2\\. 合成资产可能是最重要的跨链方案\n\n既然当前的跨链方案都不够Make sense，那么究竟有什么办法可以让区块链世界打破价值孤岛呢？\n\n合成资产的目标是交易任意资产，虽然当前采用的合成方案并不可以与实际资产共享除价值波动之外的属性，但是从需求的角度讲，大部分的用户对“资产”的需求往往也只有享受价格波动所带来的收益。\n所以，笔者大胆的认为，合成资产也许才是目前最可行也最去中心化的资产跨链解决方案（信息跨链不在所定义的范围内）\n\n3\\.合成资产是怎么做的？\n\n（1）超额抵押模型\n\n严格意义来说合成资产这一领域的先行者是MakerDao，因为DAI所代表的美元本质上也是链外资产的链上合成形式。\n\n用户通过抵押ETH的形式，由外部去中心化预言机获取美元/ETH的价格，以150%的超额抵押模型来制造出美元稳定币——DAI\n\n根据上图我们可以很明显的看出，MakerDao通过一套超额抵押的模型，在链上合成了美元稳定币。由于DAI的价格不会出现太大波动，所以当抵押品的价格下跌时，抵押率就会变小。这时，当抵押率触发清算阈值时，抵押品会在市场上被公开拍卖，拍卖机器人会帮抵押者还债，并拿走抵押人的抵押品。\n\n橘黄色部分为清算流程：\n\n以上既是抵押合成美元的完整流程，那么既然如此，我们就可以发现，只要外部预言机可以去中心化的获得稳定的资产报价，理论上我们就可以合成任何资产。\n\nMirror即是这样做的，在合成资产项目Mirror上用户可以抵押UST（Terra生态的半算法稳定币）生成多种合成资产。用户可以在Mirror内置的AMM上交易多种合成资产，包括股票，黄金等。\n\n（2）全局债务模型\n\n而合成资产赛道最大的项目Synthetix的方案与MakerDao和Mirror略有不同，除了一样是通过超额抵押的形式合成某种资产之外，Synthetix还基于报价交易模型建立了全新的全局债务机制。使得Synthetix的用户先合成美元稳定币sUSD，再利用sUSD无滑点，无限流动性的交易成股票，外汇等支持的任意合成资产。\n\n这种全局债务模型也是合成资产最复杂的部分，让我们以这样的思路来理解全局债务模型。\n\n如果我们是产品经理，需求是为合成资产创造一个不计流动性，且依赖外部报价的交易市场。我们应该怎么做？\n\n首先，我们需要明白，如果价格完全来自于外部报价，则意味着这个交易市场没有定价权，没有定价权意味着平台内的交易需求需要尽可能的与外部市场的交易需求类似。这样才可以保障不存在内盘的溢价损失。\n\nSynthetix是这样做的：他借鉴了传统交易模型中的报价驱动模型，由某个大型的做市商向市场提供报价，买卖用户的对手盘是做市商而不是彼此。而Synthetix官方并不会扮演这个大型中心化做市商的角色。所以，他的解决方案是全局债务：\n\n举例说明：\n\n假设如用户A与用户B分别抵押生成了1000美金的cUSD，当前全局的债务为1000美金+1000美金=2000美金。而用户A向创建了价值500美金的特斯拉股票。而一天后特斯拉股票上涨了100%。全局的债务就变成1500美金+1000美金。这时候当A和B要赎回自己的资产时，他们需要共担多出的500美金的债务，所以用户A就获利了500-500/2=250美金，而用户B则亏损了500-500/2=250美金。\n\n这边是传统的合成资产项目所通用的债仓模型。\n\n4\\.合成资产赛道的问题\n\n但是不论是MakerDao这样的超额抵押的模型还是Synthetix的超额抵押+全局债务的模型，实际上都存在很多的问题。在探讨时，我们先主观的将合成资产产品分为上述的两种类型。\n\n（1）质押借贷模型的问题\n\n抵押ETH借DAI的模型是一个超额抵押的模型，需求可能有多种：\n\nA.用户不想售出ETH，但又在当下较为缺钱。所以才执行这样的操作。本质上是在看多ETH，看空合成资产。因为如果用户只是缺钱，而且不看多ETH，完全可以立马把ETH卖了。如果合成资产是TSLA，XAU等波动资产时，合成资产的用户本质上应该是看多抵押品，看空合成资产的。而这种需求出现的可能性较低，最好的办法就是跟Mirror一样把抵押品设置为一个稳定资产。这样，合成资产的用户所要面临的价格波动风险会降低很多。\n\nB.看空某种资产完全可以使用其他资本效率更高的办法，超额抵押的形式实在是不够性格，因此，大部分合成资产的发行人的实质上的需求应该是套利。\n\n这里的套利分两种，第一种是抵押挖矿套取平台币，第二种是按照预言机价格合成资产再去套取外部交易市场溢价。\n\n具体如图：\n\n以DAI为例，当区块链世界对DAI的需求上升时，DAI/USDT的交易对会产生溢价，比如一枚DAI=1.1USDT。这时候使用ETH抵押合成DAI，并在二级市场换成1.1倍的USDT。当DAI的供应量加大时，价格会回归，届时再将1.1倍的USDT换成DAI并还债，套取利润。\n\n这只是个最简单的示例，还有更多的套利变式，此处不再赘述。\n\n从这个例子，我们可以看出，质押借贷模型下，合成资产在链上的外部交易所的价格很容易产生溢价，这部分溢价可能才是大多数抵押人的源动力。\n\nMakerDao还好，只需要维护DAI这一个币种的流动性。而Mirror每上线一个新的合成资产就必须多维护一个资产的流动性，不然流动性稀缺的外盘会产生巨大的套利空间。\n\n因此，我们可以看到Mirror的流动性挖矿所激励的交易对极多。这将严重增加运营团队的运营压力。通俗一点来说，这种形式比较适合一些更加“有钱”的团队。在笔者与多位投资人接触的过程中，很多人也认为合成资产赛道需要多融资。\n\n这确实是个问题，但是也不一定全对，因为这个问题基本上只对质押借贷模型的合成资产项目有所影响。\n\nC. 超额抵押合成模型在极端行情下存在全局清算风险，以2020年的312和2021年519为例，当抵押品短时间内出现较大幅度的下跌时，抵押品清算的速度将超过用户添加抵押品或者还债的速度。而清算这一行为本身也会加剧抵押品的价格下跌，当大量抵押品被短时间清算时，流动性越差的资产受到的影响越大。\n\n且这种全局清算风险在抵押品和合成资产均为波动资产的情况下尤其严重。因此，大部分产品的最低抵押率设置的都会比较高，且在清算机制上为了应对死亡螺旋事件的发生，往往会采用延迟报价或者部分清算的方式。\n\n（2）全局债务+质押借贷模型所面临的问题\n\n这种形式本质上把所有抵押人变成了报价驱动模型里所讲述的“做市商”。抵押人成为了交易者的对手方，抵押者在做抵押的同时也在对赌交易者收益能力。当交易者收益为负时，抵押者，或者说发行cUSD的用户债务减免。当交易者收益为正时，抵押者，或者说发行cUSD的用户债务增加。\n\n1\\.大部分抵押人和交易者重合，正确判断的用户赚的少，没有操作的用户可能会亏损。\n2\\.新的交易标的加入难度会大大提高，影响交易标的的可扩展性\n3\\.完全依赖预言机报价所带来的抢跑交易问题严重\n\n这是合理的嘛？我们不禁发出这样的疑问？\n\n用户交易合成资产的本意是希望在链上无审查，无监管，去中心化的交易各类有价值的资产。合成资产协议的目的是希望给区块链世界带来更多有价值的资产标的。\n\n但是如果用户需要承担这种“债务风险”的话，用户为什么要去这些平台来合成？\n\n这也同时是这些合成资产协议目前所面临的困境，当市场情绪比较旺盛，平台币价格以及流动性激励足够丰富的时候，债务风险并非是用户所考虑的重点，但是当平台币本身价格受挫，所面临的清算风险将是灾难性的，抵押品价格下跌，合成资产价格反倒上升。另一些合成了稳定币的用户也难逃全局债务的惩罚。\n\n我们观察到一些初始流动性较差的全局债务型合成资产项目如在创立初期都遇到了类似的问题。且最大的全局债务合成资产项目——Synthetix一直试图通过各种方法来解决这个问题。\n\n从SIP中我们看到了各种各样的解决方案。\n<https://blog.synthetix.io/debt-hedging-refresher-for-snx-stakers/>\n这篇blog继续阐述并提醒了用户债务的波动问题。\n<https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-181/>\n这篇提案建议以未平仓头寸的份额以及合成资产的全球流动性为参考维度，针对预言机所提供的价格增加溢价，以此来通过平衡债务，并且降低抢跑交易所带来的风险。\n还有Synthetix社区曾经提议创建债务镜像指数资产\n<https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-25-synthetix-debt-pool-mirror-index/1104>\n将创建一个由五部分组成的指数（wBTC、wETH、DAI、DPI 和 LINK）来模拟债务池的构成\\*（美元减少 10%）。\n简而言之，这种镜像指数的目的是希望可以对冲全局债务所带来的波动，甚至有人提议将sUSD替换成sDEBT。\n由此可见债务波动问题所带来的影响有多大。\n\n（3）赛道整体所面临的问题：\n\n除了上述这两种类型的合成资产项目所面临的特定问题之外，整体赛道还面临一些其他问题。\n\nA.合成资产项目产品逻辑过于复杂，合约交互成本以及用户体验成本都较高。\n以最大的合成资产项目synthetix为例，打开synthetix的PC端官网会发现很难直接找到可以交易合成资产的地方。这是因为synthetix将自身合成资产的交易独立出了另一个生态项目Kwenta。将资产的发行和交易分割开，对于新用户来说使用体验较差。且合成资产的逻辑较为复杂，且合约的交互成本较高。不过最近这个问题随着Synthetix已经整体迁移到layer2，得到了不少的改善。\n\nB.资产规模受限\n主流的合成资产项目均为平台币抵押发行，即使是Mirror所采用的UST也一样是由LUNA单币抵押所发行的。这会导致，合成资产的发行规模受到平台币市值的极大限制。且迭代的成本非常高，可扩展性极差。\n试想，如果一个合成资产项目的使命是为区块链世界引入链外资产，但可引入的规模却永远小于平台币市值的五分之一甚至八分之一，这是不可接受的。\n\nC.产品整体的开放性较差，债务风险影响大\n多数合成资产项目，虽然与Uniswap等DEX一样拥有交易功能，且交易体验相对更好。但是资产类型的开放性较差。不同于Uniswap完全自由的形式，合成资产的交易标的要求甚高。这主要是因为合成资产所采用的交易模型是全局债务模型。在这种模式下任何新的交易标的都会对现有的债务池产生影响，因此很难做到足够的开放，往往需要通过社区治理的形式才可以加入新的交易标的。\n\nD.交易模型过于复杂，产品使用门槛高\n参与发行的用户所需要承担的风险相较于其他借贷，稳定币等超额抵押的模式更高。因为，影响抵押品清算的因子除了抵押品/合成资产的价格外还包括全局债务。这使得用户的参与门槛较高。成熟的发行和交易模型中用户不应该考虑除了交易对价格波动之外的其他风险。\n\n虽然合成资产项目目前还存在如上所述的几个重大的问题，但是如果可以妥善的解决以上的问题。合成资产项目的优势也会特别大。\n\n5\\.合成资产的可扩展性\n\n由于合成资产本身的复杂性以及特殊的交易模型。合成资产项目往往具有自成生态的能力。\n\nA.合成资产的发行实际上可以包含完善的超额抵押稳定币发行模块\n如下图所示：\n\nB.合成资产的抵押发行模块也与超额抵押借贷模型存在类似的情况。\n\n以同样的流程图为基础：仅需要新增存款池，并且将发行的合成资产债务替换为实际存款池的资金。并且收取额外的借贷利息。\n\nC.合成资产的交易实际上是比Uniswap等其他产品体验更好的DEX，因为不需要额外添加流动性，不需要做市商参与做市，交易无滑点。以平均1%的滑点，最新的24小时交易数据为例，同等交易额的情况下合成资产的交易模型可以为用户减少近3000万美金的滑点损失。\n\nD.合成资产项目由于其报价交易模型以及抵押发行的全局债务共担模型的存在，很容易就可以衍生杠杆以及合约交易产品。甚至，各类二类期权，保险产品都可以脱胎于这一体系之中。\n\n以Synthetix为例，扩展性较强帮助其生态已经不只局限于合成资产的发行，还包括上文提到的Kwenta交易所，Dhedge资产管理协议等。\n但是这样的扩展性在Synthetix上又无法发挥到极致。主要原因是产品本身的沉没成本太高。初始的设计限制了Synthetix的发展，并且很难改动。在下一个篇章，我们会仔细分析这里所存在的问题和我们的解决方案。\n\n综上所述, 自成生态的合成资产不能够单纯的以某一个DeFi项目来理解。高扩展性足以帮助合成资产项目拥有比其他类型项目更大的潜力。\n\n6\\.合成资产赛的可组合性\n\nDeFi产品区别于传统金融产品一个巨大优势就是可组合性，各个DeFi项目通过合约调用可以完成更加复杂的功能，并且可以最大化资本效率。\n因此，判断一个赛道的潜力，必须考虑这个赛道的可组合性。\n相较于其他赛道来说，合成资产产品由于其独特的产品功能变的更加可组合。\n\n举例说明：\nA.无滑点的报价交易模型很适合帮助内盘资产如AMM体系内的BTC，ETH等主流数字资产交易降低滑点。如curve就通过DAI（稳定币）/sUSD（1比1兑换）/sBTC（无滑点）/BTC（1比1兑换）的形式来降低DAI/BTC的大额交易滑点。\n\nB.通过合成资产平台发行的价值共识更强的资产可以成为其他抵押借贷类，超额稳定币类产品的抵押品。\n\nC.资产合成的过程本质上与抵押借贷的过程一致，因此在一些其他的用例中，合成资产项目也可以发挥和借贷类产品一样的作用。\n\n合成资产赛道如果可以解决现存的困难，那么，有理由相信，合成资产产品将有巨大的潜力可以引爆市场。\n\n02\n可行的解决方案以及思路\n\n1\\.模块化合成资产的各个关键组成部分\n\n以最复杂的Synthetix的全局债务模型为例，我们可以将下图分解为四个组成部分：\n\n以这种模块化的思路，我们可以更加清晰的看懂解决方案的思路及影响。\n\n2\\.回溯问题，提出解决方案\n\n（1）合成资产项目产品逻辑过于复杂，合约交互成本以及用户体验成本都较高。\n\n这个问题在当下并不严重，虽然回顾Synthetix的sip历史，会发现Synthetix在降低合约交互成本上提出过很多设想，但是本质问题是layer1的效率太低，成本太高。\n当主要功能迁移到Layer2或者其他性能更加的底层时，问题不大。\n且这一点，在新兴的合成资产项目上表现明显。以下汇总了一些先知曾研究过的合成资产项目的情况：\n\n（2）资产规模受限\n\n这个问题的解决办法实际上也较为简单，选择优质的实际来支持多抵押品：但是需要特别指出的是，在全局债务池的模式下，新增的其他抵押品必须与平台币的定位相同且公用同一个债务池。\n因为只有这样才可以保证新的抵押品发行的合成资产是在扩大整体的资产规模，而不是和原有的债务池对赌。\n\nsynthetix的新增抵押品就面临我所提到的问题，ETH和BTC所发行的抵押品本质上是一个抵押借贷的行为，snx的全局债务池借出sUSD给ETH和BTC的债务池。\n\n那么，即使新增了抵押品，新增抵押品的资产规模还是必须小于SNX的市值\\*最低抵押率。\n<https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-97/>\n具体可以参考这篇sip。\n\n而synthetix不加实际的多抵押品的原因，据我们的研究来看，snx的代币合约与主要合约耦合较大，存在“技术债务”，技术上无法执行。\n此外，其他的抵押品应该均为波动较小的外盘资产，而非内盘合成资产。因为外盘资产才对资产规模有帮助。\n其他产品的抵押品情况如下（对资产规模无本质帮助的多抵押品模型记为伪）\n\n（3）交易模型过于复杂，产品使用门槛高\n\n这个问题的是笔者在使用过程当中所遇到的最令人沮丧的问题，大部分合成资产项目的UI质量较差，笔者认为，差的原因在于所有项目的UI都没有合理的优先级排序和清晰的使用区域划分。\n\n在我看来，合成资产项目应该将产品的功能分为非常明确的三个区域。这三个区域的划分基于合成资产项目所要面对的用户画像。\n\n本质上合成资产项目应该有三类用户：\n第一类用户是资产发行人也是抵押者，他们通过承担抵押发行的债务波动风险来捕获cUSD需求上升所带来的套利空间。\n\n第二类用户是交易者，他们的需求是在合成资产平台购买合成资产。\n\n第三类是矿工，他们的目的是通过抵押或者交易的行为来获取奖励。\n\n在某些情况下这三种用户的属性可能重合，但是根据这样的画像来捋顺相关的UI设计逻辑应该是更加合理的。\n\n上述项目的具体情况我贴了地址，大家可以自行研究\n\n（4）无定价权所带来的内盘溢价问题\n\n在本文的第一段的第四节，我们讨论过超额抵押模型所带来的合成资产内盘溢价问题，这个问题的解决思路有两种：\n\nA.增加内盘交易对的流动性，当流动性更大时，相同体量的内盘需求所造成的溢价影响就会越小，这种解决思路与扩大整体资产规模的思路一直。增加价值基础，可以减少个体操作所带来的影响。\n\nB.创造更大的套利空间，促使套利者抹平溢价\n这种方案类似于中心化交易所的做市商激励计划和流动性挖矿激励计划。可以通过阶梯手续费的形式来为降低套利者的套利成本，本质上也是在为“做市商”降低做市成本。\n或者通过代币激励的形式激励套利者的套利行为。\n\n（5）无定价权所带来的债务波动问题\n\n上图是这些项目所采用的交易模型：可以看出大部分项目都采用了类似Synthetix的全局债务模型。这种交易模型的好处是显而易见的。但是问题我们也再三提到：\n\n解决思路大概有以下五种：\n\n1：扩大整体的资产规模\n\n举例说明，如果平台内cUSD的头寸占总头存的比例越大，那么意味着其他合成资产头寸对整体债务的影响越小。所以扩大整体的资产规模本质上就是在降低个体债务变化对全局债务的影响。\n\n如图所示，当cUSD的持仓很大时，即使cTSLA涨幅高达200%，对全局债务的影响依旧很小。\n\n2：提供反向资产或者做空的功能来调节平台的净头寸\n\n因为反向资产本质上也算是正向资产的对手方，当净头寸无限趋近于0时，意味着无论平台内的合成资产价格如何变化，债务都不会新增。因为所有的多头寸变化都有缺头寸变化对冲。\n\n如图所示，如果平台内的合成资产债务有cUSD，TSLA，iTSLA三种，则TSLA=iTSLA.则：即使TSLA涨幅超过100%也对全局债务没有任何影响。\n\n3：经济激励的形式来调整净头寸\n\n当userB持仓的TSLA头寸远大于userC持仓的iTSLA头寸时，iTSLA所起到的平衡作用就变得微乎其微了。所以，经济激励是很直观的方式，可以根据实际的情况灵活调整。\n\n这样做的意义，本质上也是创造套利空间。\n套利者可以在合成资产平台购买缺头寸资产，并在外部市场购买等值的多头存资产来进行对冲。获得的平台币激励-手续费损耗即为最终的无风险收益。\n\n4：动态手续费+持仓费率\n\n通过上一个解决方案我们可以很清晰的看出，全局债务的平衡机制有一些类似永续合约的价格回归现货价格的平衡机制。\n\n均是通过创造套利空间的方式来促使多头存的降低，并且增加缺头寸。核心逻辑是希望净头寸无限趋近于0.或者说降低净头寸在总头存当中的占比。因为净头寸的变化是影响全局债务变化的核心。净头寸的占比越小对全局债务的影响越小。\n\n所以，动态手续费机制和持仓费率机制一样适用于全局债务交易模型。\n\n的问题：这种费用的增加实际上变相的增加收了“滑点”，不会增加合成资产项目与其他项目的交互。比如前文所不同的曲线与合成物的BTC大额兑换就不是唯一的属性。\n\n但是，可能会从短期来看，与某些知名项目的可说是很重要的。但资产所招募的委托和需求是其他任何特定的现实项目所无法比拟的。而且有些滑点，在净头寸越时间滑点也会越小。当资产规模小摔时，滑点也会越。可组合性的影响也会越小。\n\n项目方还是应该从更广泛的角度来思考问题。以自己的经验来看，可能最近项目的债务风险远比组合带来的影响更大。\n\n5：产品能力对赌鱼池\n\n前文中，我们在讨论债务问题时有“欢乐人交易了交易者的戏剧方，兔人在做兔子的同时对赌者的产出能力”。\n\n这显然是因为，如果时间严重拉长一些，可能有个别用户持有多头存可以得到认知，但可能其他用户高位持有多头存并在低位出售。则债务会不增反。\n\n在很多成熟的市场中，大多数可能的用户确实是亏钱。如果在合成资产项目数据确定后根据之前的阶段性数据提供一个对赌池。\n\n参与对赌池的用户注资cUSD来对赌下一个阶段的债务变化。\n\n如果债务增加了，那么对赌池支付增加的金额。如果债务下降了，那么本来可以给玩家减免的债务奖励给参与者对赌池​​的用户。\n\n破坏的目的是创造一个债务指数产品，可以让用户来赌这部分风险。\n\n可以说是可以更轻松的让逍遥者与镜面，制造者道这种纯超额宽带的霹雳者们承载着舞台。\n\n难点是在产品周期设计、价格跟踪、定价方式，以及出现无法全额赔付等情况的处理上。\n\n以上就是先知所思考的一些解决方案。我们看过了上述的项目，将类似的解决方案的办法在下面了解了。\n\n除了上述项目外，还有UMA也魔法合成资产。另外的二重奏在合成资产的动态模型上采用了类似算法稳定的形式。这个部分预言者的研究还没有深入，在此不会展开了。\n\n03总述\n\n确切地说，解决现实存在的问题很多，但都是由各自的方法造成的。不过是因为周围环境复杂，还是先发现在的项目由于缺乏总结，在设计之初从表面经验的技术缺陷。的表现来看，这些技术成为了牵连这些项目发展的重要因素。\n\n所以，架构设计的可扩展性和产品功能的可扩展性也将是先知日后所会关注的重点。\n\n特别声明，本文只探讨产品设计相关内容。因此，目前针对市场投资和市场表现没有大量分析。当然，还没有关于研究内容的具体内容，请与先知实验室联系。",

If we borrow Marx's theory of capital circulation, the primary market is like a production link, and the secondary market is like a free market transaction link, and surplus value can only come from the primary market.\n  Of course, the actual situation is much more complicated than this. There are also many situations in the secondary market that damage its freedom and fairness, such as insider trading, market manipulation, and so on. In addition, financial products themselves can become financial capital, which can be used to capture surplus value by investing in the production links of the physical industry.\n  In contemporary society, in the general legal sense, the manipulation of the secondary market is considered illegal, while the production of surplus value is considered legal. At the moment when the regulatory nature of the encryption field has not yet been clarified, the illegality of the former is difficult to be substantively investigated, resulting in the current situation in which the secondary market of the currency market is full of various market manipulation behaviors that undermine fairness and freedom.\n  The income of the secondary market investment is basically derived from technological innovation and progress, and the resulting increase in social productivity. However, due to the widespread irrationality of the market, the secondary market is often full of opportunities to speculate on volatility under local time and space.\n  Many people are not clear about what kind of investment they are participating in. They often enter the market with hindsight, fall into the zero-sum game of partial time and space in the secondary market, and become the reaped.\n  Such a blind investment method, whether it is entering the stock market or the currency market, will probably have a similar ending.

{"id": "djQSI1F2RhpybTFGk3XZIhb2c9AOnfs0sQoKaj8L4is", "title": "区块链的合规之路", "body": "```\n各位朋友们，大家好。作为一个在区块链行业工作的普通人，\n结合过去拥有的法律知识和实践经验，作为在Mirror平台的第一篇文章，\n想和大家分享关于区块链以及分散式金融（DeFi）背后的含义，法律背后的含义，\n以及未来如果要规制区块链的话，可能被采取的规制等一些问题的看法\n（在中国大陆地区已经禁止加密货币交易的前提下，\n我们重要会讨论美国等地区的规制问题）。\n希望各位朋友可以共同探讨，\n期待这个区块链这个圈子可以带领我们走向更加美好的未来。\n```\n\n## 第一部分 区块链以及分散式金融的本质\n\n```\n区块链本质是一种分布式的数据库。\n密码学技术，帮助我们实现了如何安全的构架这种分布式数据库。\n而产生这种分布式数据库的原因在于，中央集权式的数据库本身的脆弱性，\n即中央数据库的损坏会导致整个系统的崩溃。\n我们希望，系统拥有一定的容错性，即在系统中部分节点出现问题，\n也不会造成整个系统的崩溃。\n这样，我们可以更加持久，更加放心的使用服务。\n而这背后的本质在于，我们不相信世界上存在永远牢不可破的中心节点，\n即对节点的非信任性。这里的节点，\n换到现实世界中，可以是指任何人，也可以是指任何机构。\n\n分散式金融是基于区块链技术形成的分布式金融系统。\n分散式金融当然的拥有区块链的特征，即金融系统的容错性。\n因此，分散式金融帮助我们实现了一些，\n现在金融系统无法实现，或者是很难实现的一些功能。\n例如，365\\*24的全天候服务，\n基于个人而非身份的平等服务，更加低廉的服务费用等。\n分散式金融的背后也和区块链技术同样，是一种对于节点的非信任性。\n\n一直以来，信任是一种非常昂贵，以及难以维持的东西。\n你可能会被多年的朋友背叛，你也可能会被多年信赖的企业所欺骗。\n反过来说，一个朋友想要维持和你的信任，需要花费的时间和成本是无法计算的，\n同样一个企业想要获得消费者的信任也是需要花费无数的时间和金钱的。\n但是，毁掉这种信任，缺只需要一件事，或者一次违约而已。\n然而，区块链以及分散式金融就是这样一种，\n无需信赖的单个节点，而是可以信赖的系统。\n这背后，本质上是指信赖这个世界上大多数的人（或者说是50%以上的人）。\n如果我们并不信赖这个世界50%以上的人，恐怕任何人都难以在这个社会生存吧，\n因为缺乏信赖的生活，成本会非常高。\n信赖的好处正是，可以降低成本。\n这种成本可以是时间上的成本，也可以是金钱上的成本，甚至是情感上的成本。\n```\n\n## 第二部分 法律的本质\n\n```\n说到法律的本质，不得不让我会想起曾经的法理学和法哲学的老师的教导。\n有关于法律的探讨可能会晦涩难懂，我尽量说的通俗易懂一些。\n说到法律背后的含义，自然就会出现，实证法主义以及自然法主义这两种学派了。\n不过，从我们的感受上来看，法律应该更接近于自然法。\n毕竟，从法律的历史演变就可以看出，\n法律应该是基于大多数人的行为习惯以及思想而产生的一种集体价值观念的系统化。\n自古历来，人们对于穷凶极恶的罪犯就应当除以严刑的朴素价值观念，\n因此，现代刑法也对于故意杀人等犯罪处以最高死刑\n（或者是永久监禁，这里不涉及对于死刑制度的探讨）。\n\n但是，当人们发现，人人平等的情况下，没有人拥有制裁他人的权力，\n只有法律可以代替所有人去制裁他人。\n那法律如果是基于人的价值观念产生的话，也会因为人的价值观念而改变，\n这样的话，法律的稳定性就会被破坏。\n大多数人很难生活在，一个朝令夕改的社会中的，因为要花费的成本太高。\n如果法律本身就只是法律，不依照人的价值观念产生的话，自然不会有上述的问题。\n然而，恶法亦法的结果，会让大多数人难以接受，尤其是在战争爆发的时候。\n所以，法律回过头来，本质还是更接近于自然法的存在。\n\n可以看出，法律本质上也是一种系统，是基于对大多数人的信任的系统。\n大多数人的价值观念是值得信赖的，\n因此基于这种价值观念产生的法律也是可以信赖的。\n法律是制度上实现了这种信赖，而区块链则是从技术上实现了这种信赖。\n```\n\n## 第三部分 区块链与法律\n\n```\n区块链和法律从某种程度上都是实现了信赖的机制的话，那这两者的区别是什么。\n虽然有很多不同，但是我想说，最大的一点不同是，适用范围的不同。\n\n法律存在一种法域的概念，就是指法律可以使用的范围。\n虽然有属人，属地等原则，大多数的情况下，可以实现的法律是基于国家行政范围的。\n也就是说，法律的施行（司法）是基于国家的强制力，\n而国家的强制力是基于国家行政范围的。\n然而，区块链技术并没有这种实践意义上的范围限制。\n任何国家，任何人都可以使用区块链技术。\n也可以说（虽然很不准确），区块链从某种成度上实现了，\n对于参与的所有人的“法律“的创设\n（从定义上来讲，是不能称作法律的，仅从意义上有共通之处，因此加上了双引号）。\n而这种“法律”，可能是自然法的某种更加具体的表现。\n\n当然，区块链实现这种“法律”的代价是，\n只能规定最基本的规则，而不能拥有更加复杂，具体，和地域性的规则。\n而现代意义上的法律，司法的意义某种程度上要大于立法的意义。\n无法执行的法律，在人们心中很难认为是法律，哪怕立法是完美的。\n因此，法律必然需要，更加具体，更加可以执行，\n而且基于国家行政范围，也更加具有地域性。\n而这一切是和区块链的初衷是相反的\n（并不是不能实现，例如联盟链，私有链等。\n但是这种区块链，缺乏了第一部分说的这种信赖机制。）\n因此，通过现代法律实现对于区块链技术的管理，\n从本质上，可能就不是一个好的实践。\n因为，这两者都是基于同一种价值观念形成的，而难以相互制约。\n```\n\n## 第四部分 实践上可能对区块链实行的义务要求\n\n```\n实践上，国家对于区块链的规制的理由可以有很多，\n例如基于金融稳定，基于投资者保护等等。\n而大多数国家也会选择对于区块链进行规制。\n因为，技术如果没有法律的规制，自然也会危害到人自身，\n而且区块链技术的初衷无法实现更加具体的规则制定，\n因此就需要外部帮助区块链技术变得更及具体，\n哪怕这种实现会让区块链偏离本来的初衷。\n\n当然，如果法律实现了对于区块链技术的规制，\n带来的好处是，可以让更多的人，更大规模的机构参与进来，\n也加快了区块链技术普及的速度。\n接下来分析一下，区块链技术，\n特别是加密货币投资以及分散式金融的主战场美国，可能会制定的一些规则。\n首先，明确一点，金融相关法律的制定，在美国的原则就是投资者保护主义。\n而投资者保护主义的原因是，金融市场的参与者之间信息不对称。\n而弥补这种信息不对称的主要方式就是信息的公开披露。\n基于这些，我们从区块链业界中各种参与主体的角度来分析可能被要求遵守那些规则。\n```\n\n### 1）矿工（Miner）\n\n```\n矿工是区块链网络中最重要的参与者，以及利益获得者。\n矿工从技术上说，就是前文中所称的节点。\n他们具体的任务是，通过计算哈希函数打包区块，广播交易，\n确认区块，更新状态，即维持区块链网络的更新和运行。\n矿工通过上述行为，获得区块链奖励，即各种币。\n矿工和一般市场投资者最大的区别就是，打包交易的选择权。\n在无数等待打包的交易中，优先选择哪些交易处理\n（虽然有基于手续费的规则，但是矿工还是可以选择），\n甚至是拒绝打包某些地址的交易等权力是矿工独有的。\n如果，矿工利用这种权力，进行利益交换的话，就会出现市场的不公平。\n因此，矿工可能会被要求遵守的规则包括： \n公开算力相关信息（机器类型，运行时间，版本型号，机器，电力，维护等成本等）\n公开挖矿奖励相关信息（获得奖励的数量，时间，奖励变现方法，时间，金额等）\n公开和上市公司相同的财务报表，重大利益关联等相关信息\n（资产负债表，现金流表，损益计算表等，股权结构，\n公司架构，利益相关方，利益相关行为等）\n```\n\n### 2）做市商（MarketMaker）\n\n```\n在加密货币市场，维持市场流动性的最大的参与者就是做市商。\n可以把币安（Binance），火币（HuobiGlobal），Coinbase等做市商看成是传统金融市场中的投资银行。\n矿工可以影响供给量，做市商可以影响价格。\n首先，做市场存在和一般投资者之间的直接的利益冲突问题。\n特别是在金融衍生品上，做市商对于价格波动的影响会非常大，\n而金融衍生品中，投资者亏的钱都是做市商的利润，\n因此对于金融衍生品交易的这部分，很大可能性，会被极其严格的规制。\n例如，杠杆倍数限制（防止市场波动导致做市商破产），\n100%甚至以上的保证金（信托管理），\n适格投资者限制（对于投资者的KYC，交易经验以及最低保证金限制等），\n所有业务总和的风险敞口控制（类似于银行的巴塞尔条约）等。\n其他的和矿工类似，财务报表，重大利益关联等相关信息的开示也很可能被要求。\n相比于矿工，做市商直接对接投资者，因此被要求的规则会更加严格。\n```\n\n### 3）托管机构（Custody）\n\n```\n托管机构，顾名思义就是帮助他人管理财产的机构。\n在加密货币的世界中，有很多有名的托管机构例如Bitgo等。\n他们负责安全的保存客户寄存在他们那里的加密货币资产。\n虽然加密货币本质上受到密码学自身的保护。\n但是，公钥和密钥的存在，必然会产生密钥泄露，被盗等危险。\n一直处于互联网连接状态的电脑本身就是不安全的这一事实，\n是需要每个投资者铭记在心的。\n因此托管机构利用各种软硬方法，实现客户资产的安全托管\n（包括但不限于冷钱包，多签等技术）。\n对于这类机构，由于他们管理着大量的资产，\n无论是从利益冲突上，还是技术安全上都应当对于他们要求极其高的义务。\n包括但不限于，客户资产和自有资产的分离管理，财务报表，\n重大利益关联等相关信息的公开，足额保证金（甚至是超额），危机处理方案等。\n```\n\n## 第五部分 区块链中特殊的参与者以及应当如何规制的问题\n\n```\n在区块链和分散式金融的世界中，\n例如Uniswap这样的自动做市商，例如AAVE这样的自动借贷服务，\n我们把这类完全由代码控制的金融服务成为分散式金融服务（DeFi）。\n同样，控制着这些服务的，不是某些大型机构或组织，\n而是由投资者，工程师等组成的分散性自律组织（DAO）。\n无论是DeFi还是DAO，他们也都是区块链世界的参与者。\n\n为何要单独拿出来这些参与者进行分析，\n原因在于他们和第四部分所讲是的参与者有着根本性的不同。\n根据第一部分和第二部分的讲述，可以认为，未来的金融应当是像区块链的初衷一样，\n基于区块链系统，而非单独节点，为更多的人提供更加便利廉价和可靠的服务。\n因此，当一种金融服务本身，不是由单独节点所管理控制的情况下，\n特别是当金融服务本身就是由投资者本人参与管理的情况下\n（例如DAO，但是对于分散度的讨论，需要单独一篇文章来分析），\n我们不应当要求这类金融服务以及他们的管理组织（DAO）履行和上述矿工，\n做市商和托管机构相同的信息公开义务。\n原因在于，他们与投资者之间并不存在市场信息的不对称，\n自然也就没有信息公开的义务，而且投资者和管理者一致的情况下，也不存在利益冲突。\n因此我认为不应当对于这类组织或服务采取过多的规则干涉，\n只要求最低限度的规则（例如：组织成员的公开，服务代码的公开，安全审计等）即可。\n\n但是有一个不得不讨论的问题就是对于分散式金融的用户是否进行以及如何进行KYC以及AML的验证。\n我们先要来考虑要求KYC和AML验证的原因。\n由于这个世界上并不是所有人都是把资金用于善意的行为，\n把资金用于犯罪行为，甚至是战争行为的个人和组织在这个世界上也存在着。\n虽然这类人和组织并不是占据大多数（50%以上），\n但是他们的行为的恶劣程度是会极大的损害这个世界上生存的其他个人和组织的利益（包括但不限于生命安全利益）。\n因此为了遏制这类行为的发生，最好的方法就是要求身份验证（KYC）以及反洗钱验证（AML）等。\n\n但是一旦进行了KYC和AML的认证，就会存在接下来的问题。\n这些数据由谁管理，无论是组织甚至是国家，都会是单节点管理。\n这些数据一旦被单节点控制，就会存在利用这些数据进行利益交换的问题\n（包括但不限于政治上经济上的利益）。\n对于这个问题，有一种解决方案是可以不需要两害之间取其轻的选择，就是分散式身份验证。\n（关于AML的解决方案，我们会在别的文章中讨论，因为涉及的问题较多）\n\nKYC验证要解决的一个问题就是“用户是谁”。\n然而只要我们可以特定某个地址背后的用户是一个人或者复数的人，或者一个组织\n（从管理账户的实际角度来说也是应该是一个或者复数的人），\n而且让这些数据以分布式的状态存在，这样就不会存在单节点控制的问题。\n但是会有人提出另一类问题，这样分布式存在的数据，会不会轻易的暴露个人隐私？\n\n答案是不会，因为分散式身份验证只能证明，这个地址的背后是特定的一个人，\n而且能知道这个人是和某些人有联系，而且这个人需要定期登录以证明自己是个真实存在的人\n但是这个人的地址等详细情况并不会存在与分布式数据库中。\n当出现问题的时候，需要警方借助其他刑侦技术，从而确定这个人的确切住址等信息。\n我认为，这种成本是为了维持非单节点控制的必要成本。\n因为如果分散式金融只有服务本身是分散式的，\n而其相关联的所有服务都是单节点控制的话，\n这种服务本身是无法实现区块链的全部初衷的。\n```",

{"id": "KBHNqWLWyTNw722DLqJuL6nQeJriWBE9SOxtH7eUWQQ", "title": "区块链的合规之路", "body": "```\n各位朋友们，大家好。作为一个在区块链行业工作的普通人，\n结合过去拥有的法律知识和实践经验，作为在Mirror平台的第一篇文章，\n想和大家分享关于区块链以及分散式金融（DeFi）背后的含义，法律背后的含义，\n以及未来如果要规制区块链的话，可能被采取的规制等一些问题的看法\n（在中国大陆地区已经禁止加密货币交易的前提下，\n我们主要会讨论美国地区的规制问题）。\n希望各位朋友可以共同探讨，\n期待这个区块链这个圈子可以带领我们走向更加美好的未来。\n```\n\n## 第一部分 区块链以及分散式金融的本质\n\n```\n区块链本质是一种分布式的数据库。\n密码学技术，帮助我们实现了如何安全的构架这种分布式数据库。\n而产生这种分布式数据库的原因在于，中央集权式的数据库本身的脆弱性，\n即中央数据库的损坏会导致整个系统的崩溃。\n我们希望，系统拥有一定的容错性，即在系统中部分节点出现问题，\n也不会造成整个系统的崩溃。\n这样，我们可以更加持久，更加放心的使用服务。\n而这背后的本质在于，我们不相信世界上存在永远牢不可破的中心节点，\n即对节点的非信任性。\n这里的节点，换到现实世界中，可以是指任何人，也可以是指任何机构。\n\n分散式金融是基于区块链技术形成的分布式金融系统。\n分散式金融当然的拥有区块链的特征，即容错性。\n因此，分散式金融帮助我们实现了一些，现在金融系统无法实现，或者是很难实现的一些功能。\n例如，365\\*24的全天候服务，基于个人而非身份的平等服务，更加低廉的服务费用等。\n分散式金融的背后的逻辑也和区块链技术同样，是一种对于节点的非信任性。\n\n一直以来，信任是一种非常昂贵，以及难以维持的东西。\n你可能会被多年的朋友背叛，你也可能会被多年信赖的企业所欺骗。\n反过来说，一个朋友想要维持和你的信任，需要花费的时间和成本是无法计算的，\n同样一个企业想要获得消费者的信任也是需要花费无数的时间和金钱的。\n但是，毁掉这种信任，却只需要一件事，或者一次违约而已。\n然而，区块链以及分散式金融是，无需让用户信赖的单个节点，而是让用户信赖基于密码学的系统（数据结构）。\n这种信赖基于密码学的系统背后的逻辑，本质上是指信赖这个世界上大多数的人\n（或者说是50%以上的人，这也是为什么区块链会存在51%攻击的问题）。\n如果我们并不信赖这个世界50%以上的人，恐怕任何人都难以在这个社会生存吧，\n因为缺乏信赖的生活，成本会非常高。信赖的好处正是，可以降低成本。\n这种成本可以是时间上的成本，也可以是金钱上的成本，甚至是情感上的成本。\n```\n\n## 第二部分 法律的本质\n\n```\n说到法律的本质，不得不让我会想起曾经的法理学和法哲学的老师的教导。\n有关于法律的探讨可能会晦涩难懂，我尽量说的通俗易懂一些。\n说到法律背后的含义，自然就会出现，实证法主义以及自然法主义这两种学派了。\n不过，从我们的感受上来看，法律应该更接近于自然法。\n毕竟，从法律的历史演变就可以看出，\n法律应该是基于大多数人的行为习惯以及思想而产生的一种集体价值观念的系统化。\n自古历来，人们拥有“对于穷凶极恶的罪犯就应当除以严刑”的朴素价值观念，\n因此，现代刑法也对于故意杀人等犯罪处以最高死刑\n（或者是永久监禁，这里不涉及对于死刑制度的探讨）。\n\n但是，当人们发现，人人平等的情况下，没有人拥有制裁他人的权力，\n只有法律可以代替所有人去制裁他人。\n那法律如果是基于人的价值观念产生的话，也会因为人的价值观念而改变，\n这样的话，法律的稳定性就会被破坏。\n大多数人很难生活在，一个朝令夕改的社会中的，因为要花费的成本太高。\n如果法律本身就只是法律，不依照人的价值观念产生的话，自然不会有上述的问题。\n（这也是实证法主义出现的原因）\n然而，恶法亦法的结果，会让大多数人难以接受，尤其是在战争爆发的时候。\n所以，法律回过头来，本质还是更接近于自然法的存在。\n（自然法主义在现代法律理论体系中占据优势地位）\n\n可以看出，法律本质上也是一种系统，是基于对大多数人的信任的系统。\n（因此我们才会在愿意生活在，由大多数人的价值观念所形成的法律的约束下生活）\n大多数人的价值观念是值得信赖的，因此基于这种价值观念产生的法律也是可以信赖的。\n法律是制度上实现了这种信赖，而区块链则是从技术上实现了这种信赖。\n```\n\n## 第三部分 区块链与法律\n\n```\n区块链和法律从某种程度上都是实现了信赖的机制的话，那这两者的区别是什么。\n虽然有很多不同，但是我想说，最大的一点不同是，适用范围的不同。\n\n法律存在一种法域的概念，就是指法律可以适用的范围。\n虽然有属人，属地等原则，大多数的情况下，可以被执行的法律是基于国家行政范围的。\n也就是说，法律的执行（司法）是基于国家的强制力，而国家的强制力是基于国家行政范围的。\n然而，区块链技术并没有这种实践意义上的范围限制。任何国家，任何人都可以使用区块链技术。\n也可以说（虽然很不准确），区块链从某种成度上实现了，对于参与的所有人的“法律“的创设\n（从定义上来讲，是不能称作法律的，仅从意义上有共通之处，因此加上了双引号）。\n而这种“法律”，可能是自然法的某种更加具体的表现。\n\n当然，区块链实现这种“法律”的代价是，\n只能规定最基本的规则，而不能拥有更加复杂，具体，和地域性的规则。\n而现代意义上的法律，司法的意义某种程度上要大于立法的意义。\n无法执行的法律，在人们心中很难认为是法律，哪怕立法是完美的。\n因此，法律必然需要，更加具体，更加可以执行，而且基于国家行政范围，也更加具有地域性。\n而这一切是和区块链的初衷是相反的。\n（并不是不能实现，例如联盟链，私有链等。但是这种区块链，缺乏了第一部分说的这种信赖机制。）\n因此，通过现代法律实现对于区块链技术的管理，从本质上，可能就不是一个好的实践。\n因为，这两者都是基于同一种价值观念形成的，而难以相互制约。\n```\n\n## 第四部分 实践上可能对区块链实行的义务要求\n\n```\n实践上，国家对于区块链的规制的理由可以有很多，例如基于金融稳定，基于投资者保护等等。\n而大多数国家也会选择对于区块链进行规制。\n因为，技术如果没有法律的规制，自然也会危害到人自身，\n而且区块链技术的初衷无法实现更加具体的规则制定，\n因此就需要外部帮助区块链技术变得更及具体，哪怕这种实现会让区块链偏离本来的初衷。\n\n当然，如果法律实现了对于区块链技术的规制，\n带来的好处是，可以让更多的人，更大规模的机构参与进来，\n也加快了区块链技术普及的速度。\n接下来分析一下，区块链技术，特别是加密货币投资以及分散式金融的主战场美国，可能会制定的一些规则。\n首先，明确一点，金融相关法律的制定，在美国的原则就是投资者保护主义。\n而投资者保护主义的原因是，金融市场的参与者之间信息不对称。\n而弥补这种信息不对称的主要方式就是信息的公开披露。\n基于这些，我们从区块链业界中各种参与主体的角度来分析可能被要求遵守那些规则。\n```\n\n### 1）矿工（Miner）\n\n```\n矿工是区块链网络中最重要的参与者，以及利益获得者。\n矿工从技术上说，就是前文中所称的节点。\n他们具体的任务是，通过计算哈希函数打包区块，广播交易，\n确认区块，更新状态，即维持区块链网络的更新和运行。\n矿工通过上述行为，获得区块链奖励，即各种币。\n矿工和一般市场投资者最大的区别就是，打包交易的选择权。\n在无数等待打包的交易中，优先选择哪些交易处理\n（虽然有基于手续费的规则，但是矿工还是可以选择），\n甚至是拒绝打包某些地址的交易等权力是矿工独有的。\n如果，矿工滥用这种权力，进行利益交换的话，就会出现市场的不公平。\n（当然最近也出现了例如EDEN等MEV保护的解决方案）\n如果技术可以完美的解决这种风险应该是最好的，\n但是例如最近出现的VC公司和项目方利用非公开情报进行内幕交易这类事件。\n（这类事件会在第五部分提及，但是矿工也存在发生这类内幕交易的风险）\n因此，矿工可能会被要求遵守的规则包括： \n公开算力相关信息（机器类型，运行时间，版本型号，机器，电力，维护等成本等）\n公开挖矿奖励相关信息（获得奖励的数量，时间，奖励变现方法，时间，金额等）\n公开和上市公司相同的财务报表，重大利益关联等相关信息\n（资产负债表，现金流表，损益计算表等，股权结构，\n公司架构，利益相关方，利益相关行为等）\n```\n\n### 2）做市商（MarketMaker）\n\n```\n在加密货币市场，维持市场流动性的最大的参与者就是做市商。\n可以把币安（Binance），火币（HuobiGlobal），Coinbase等做市商看成是传统金融市场中的投资银行。\n矿工可以影响供给量，做市商可以影响价格。\n首先，做市商存在和一般投资者之间的直接的利益冲突问题。\n特别是在金融衍生品上，做市商对于价格波动的影响会非常大，\n而金融衍生品中，投资者亏的钱都是做市商的利润，\n因此对于金融衍生品交易的这部分，很大可能性，会被极其严格的规制。\n例如，杠杆倍数限制（防止市场波动导致做市商破产），\n100%甚至以上的保证金（信托管理），\n适格投资者限制（对于投资者的KYC，交易经验以及最低保证金限制等），\n所有业务总和的风险敞口控制（类似于银行的巴塞尔条约）等。\n其他的和矿工类似，财务报表，重大利益关联等相关信息的开示也很可能被要求。\n相比于矿工，做市商直接对接投资者，因此被要求的规则会更加严格。\n因此未来中心化交易所（CEX）类型的做市商可能会更好的服务于机构投资者。\n而对于个人投资者，利用分散式交易所（DEX）可能会有更好的体验。\n```\n\n### 3）托管机构（Custody）\n\n```\n托管机构，顾名思义就是帮助他人管理财产的机构。\n在加密货币的世界中，有很多有名的托管机构例如Bitgo等。\n他们负责安全的保存客户寄存在他们那里的加密货币资产。\n虽然加密货币本质上受到密码学自身的保护。\n但是，公钥和密钥的存在，必然会产生密钥泄露，被盗等危险。\n一直处于互联网连接状态的电脑本身就是不安全的这一事实，是需要每个投资者铭记在心的。\n因此托管机构利用各种软硬方法，实现客户资产的安全托管（包括但不限于冷钱包，多签等技术）。\n对于这类机构，由于他们管理着大量的资产，无论是从利益冲突上，还是技术安全上都应当对于他们要求极其高的义务。\n包括但不限于，客户资产和自有资产的分离管理，财务报表，\n重大利益关联等相关信息的公开，足额保证金（甚至是超额），危机处理方案等。\n```\n\n## 第五部分 区块链中特殊的参与者以及应当如何规制的问题\n\n```\n在区块链和分散式金融的世界中，例如Uniswap这样的自动做市商，例如AAVE这样的自动借贷服务，\n我们把这类完全由代码控制的金融服务成为分散式金融服务（DeFi）。\n同样，控制着这些服务的，不是某些大型机构或组织，\n而是由投资者，工程师等组成的分散性自律组织（DAO）。\n无论是DeFi还是DAO，他们也都是区块链世界的参与者。\n\n为何要单独拿出来这些参与者进行分析，原因在于他们和第四部分所讲的参与者有着根本性的不同。\n根据第一部分和第二部分的讲述，可以认为，未来的金融应当是像区块链的初衷一样，\n是分布式的，而非单节点控制，以此为更多的人提供更加便利廉价和可靠的服务。\n因此，当一种金融服务本身，不是由单节点所管理控制的情况下，\n特别是当金融服务本身就是由投资者本人参与管理的情况下，\n（例如DAO，但是对于组织的分散程度，需要单独一篇文章来分析。\n组织的分散程度决定着可能接受不同类型的规则制约。）\n我们不应当要求这类金融服务以及他们的管理组织（DAO）履行和上述矿工，\n做市商和托管机构相同的信息公开义务。\n原因在于，他们与投资者之间并不存在市场信息的不对称，自然也就没有信息公开的义务，\n而且投资者和管理者一致的情况下，也不存在利益冲突。\n因此我认为不应当对于这类组织或服务采取过多的规则干涉，\n只要求最低限度的规则（例如：组织成员的公开，服务代码的公开，安全审计等）即可。\n\n但是有一个不得不讨论的问题就是对于分散式金融的用户是否进行以及如何进行KYC以及AML的验证。\n我们先要来考虑要求KYC和AML验证的原因。\n由于这个世界上并不是所有人都是把资金用于善意的行为，\n把资金用于犯罪行为，甚至是战争行为的个人和组织在这个世界上也存在着。\n虽然这类人和组织并不是占据大多数（50%以上），\n但是他们的行为的恶劣程度是会极大的损害这个世界上生存的其他个人和组织的利益（包括但不限于生命安全利益）。\n因此为了遏制这类行为的发生，最好的方法就是要求身份验证（KYC）以及反洗钱验证（AML）等。\n\n但是一旦进行了KYC和AML的认证，就会存在接下来的问题。\n这些数据由谁管理，无论是组织甚至是国家，都会是单节点管理。\n这些数据一旦被单节点控制，就会存在利用这些数据进行利益交换的问题\n（包括但不限于政治上经济上的利益）。\n对于这个问题，有一种解决方案是可以不需要两害之间取其轻的选择，就是分散式身份验证。\n（关于AML的解决方案，我们会在别的文章中讨论，因为涉及的问题较多）\n\nKYC验证要解决的一个问题就是“用户是谁”。\n然而只要我们可以特定某个地址背后的用户是一个人或者复数的人，或者一个组织\n（从管理账户的实际角度来说也应该是一个或者复数的人），\n而且让这些数据以分布式的状态存在，这样就不会存在单节点控制的问题。\n但是会有人提出另一类问题，这样分布式存在的数据，会不会轻易的暴露个人隐私？\n\n答案是不会，因为分散式身份验证只能证明，这个地址的背后是某个人，\n而且能知道这个人的部分信息（不包括住址等个人信息）。\n分散式身份验证的目的是通过类似POW的机制，让一个地址付出一定的代价（每日打卡，参与活动等），\n通过以此证明这个地址的背后是一个真实且值得信赖的人。\n（当然现阶段这种技术还不足以替代KYC和AML，因此还需要未来出现更加符合监管要求的解决方案）\n但是分散式身份验证确实是向我们指明了，区块链技术无限的可能性。\n而且如果分散式金融只有服务本身是分散式的，而其相关联的所有服务都是单节点控制的话，\n那这种服务本身是无法实现区块链的全部初衷的。\n```",

{"id": "TLyOEdPMyDINUO_nKuznvj55Vks6fVk8P3dW0JHi-r4", "title": "幣圈人物傳 (一) — 「Defi之王」YFI創始人 Andre Cronje - 幣聞 COINFO - Medium", "body": "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*RDtPzSQFjOCOGXxX4cJ2AQ.png)\n\n今天想跟大家介紹幣圈大神之一，被稱為「Defi之王」的YFI創始人 Andre Cronje (社群中簡稱AC)。AC深受幣圈投資人的喜愛及崇拜。借貸協議Aave 的創始人Stani Kulechov 更曾表示「我從AC身上學到很多東西，如果沒有他，產業都不知道要怎麼辦。」\n\nAC的背景：\n\n* AC出生於南非(與馬斯克一樣!)，就讀南非的斯泰倫博斯大學法學專業。偶然一次他接觸到電腦科學課程並且非常感興趣，然後靠著自學相關課程便慢慢踏進了代碼世界。他畢業後在一家移動通信公司工作，在這期間學習了大數據，機器學習等高價值領域。他後來到了一家大型零售公司工作，負責搭建該公司的借貸、保險和零售平台。但工作幾年後便感到太無聊而辭職。後來在2017年接觸到區塊鏈，經過深入了解後，發覺這新興技術能大大改善現今傳統金融的問題，例如智能合約能大大減低中介商的成本，使金融服務變得更便宜。\n* 他於2017年起便在CryptoBriefing網站上更新專欄，深入分析了不少區塊鏈項目，例如Holochain、NuCypher、Skrumble Network、CPChain、和bloXroute。他也曾與他人一同發開了加密錢包，CryptoCurve。後來因行情不佳而最終放棄。AC也參與過Fantom和Wanchain等著名項目。他直到現今仍是Fantom的技術顧問。直至後來2019年，AC意識到Defi的重要性，便開始著手開發YFI。\n\nAC成名巨著， 被譽為「DeFi 中的BTC」- YFI：\n\n* 2020年初，Yearn(YFI的智能協議)剛剛上線。AC 為了開發這項目，花光儲蓄，除了要支付4萬 美元的開發成本，其他雜費如審計和託管花了他兩倍的資金。故此他更抵押自己的房子，以換來上大約2 萬美元的貸款。\n* 我們可以把Yearn比喻成一個建立在以太坊上的智能銀行(以代碼組成)。在加密幣世界裡，由於市場資金效率低，不同的借貸資金池利率波動很大。投資者為了保持高回報，必需人手去觀察市場利率動態，再作修改。(例如你把錢投放在A池，現在年利率是50%，但明天突然變成30%，你就要人手調動資金到別的池去保持高回報。) 而Yearn正正簡化了這麻煩過程，在智能合約的協助下，投資者只需把資金放進這合約裡，協議便會自動查看不同放貸平台的年收益率，再自動調配資金到池之間，帶來更高，更穩定的收益。這聽上去很美好，但其實上線首半年，Yearn 都沒有引起廣泛關注，直至2020年中，Yearn宣布推出治理代幣YFI並啟動流動性挖礦，年利率超過750%，YFI才開始真正火熱起來。\n* YFI其中一個很受人喜愛的原因是AC沒有為YFI作出融資 (即把股權/代幣賣給機構以融集資金)，故此在推行政策時，不需受到他人的影響。而且更瘋狂的是，AC發行的YFI代幣，他自己一顆也沒留，將全部共3萬顆YFI全部留給社群。而持有YFI代幣即享有掌管YFI發展的投票及管治權(即類似股東的權益)。這代表著，AC讓YFI變成完全去中心化的協議，自己並未有任何收益。你能想像一個人背上貸款，花光儲蓄去開發一個項目，而不求任何回報的人嗎? 他就是AC，Defi狂人。\n* 後來YFI社群裡有成員對YFI發展前路有分歧，便發起了硬分叉，創建了另一個相同名字的項目，YFII。這又是另一個故事了。YFI這項目為AC帶來超強人氣，更有人比喻YFI為「DeFi 中的比特幣」。\n\nAC開發過的項目有很多，當中包括:\n\n* Eminence.finance — 基於YFI的GAMEFI項目。後來因沒有為代碼審計過，被駭客發現漏洞，盜取了 1,500 萬美元，項目 直接歸零\n* Liquidity Income（LBI）- 致力解決流動性挖礦帶來的無常損失問題\n* Keep3r Network (KPR) — 去中心化的鏈上服務外包網路\n\n最近AC也著手開發一個新項目名為 Fixed Forex(穩定幣協議)，致力提供快速的鏈上跨境轉帳服務(例如美金轉至韓元)。發展仍在早期，協議正在測試階段。故此非常高風險。\n\nAC最近在推特上表示，政府可能在1–2年內會推Defi市場帶來監管，用戶的恐慌持續2–3年，而後政府會意識到監管不能強制執行，而故此會讓Defi有自定義的監管框架。\n\nAC在幣圈中受到很多不同立場的評價，但基於他的貢獻以及成就，他確實有資格被稱為「Defi之王」。一起期待AC在以後的日子裡會為Defi帶來什麼樣的驚喜吧!", "timestamp": 1633849054, "digest": "3INvQDfDqLS-_yTVb-uz4uiHsile6SZYvPeHYbcboHs", "contributor": "0x82f74A43bDEB977b95c767448656DAb7fFF25f2b"}

The massive influx of interest in NFT projects is fostering ecosystem-wide growth as new users flock to Solana and experience the network’s low-cost transactions and revolutionary throughput for the first time.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Solana community has experienced everything from the excitement of pre-drop hype to the frustration of getting stuck with failed transactions after weeks of anticipating the newest NFT project. At Raydium we’ve watched a lot of this go down, and we understand the huge time and resource costs that teams face when building out their launch infrastructure for a drop.\n\nWe have witnessed the launch of secondary marketplaces, but calls for fair and uninterrupted NFT drops still echo across Crypto Twitter and the Discord ether. The Solana Community has spoken. Raydium may just have an answer.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*YXbofwU51t8ViXc3)\n\n**The Launch of DropZone**\n\nWe are excited to announce the upcoming launch of DropZone — an initiative by Raydium** **to promote the growth of NFTs on Solana while supporting project teams with the infrastructure needed to launch new collections.\n\nDropZone will serve as a launchpad for the hottest Solana NFT projects to raise capital, seamlessly distribute NFT collections, and build their community. Raydium’s DropZone will deploy flexible smart contracts and one of the largest networks of RPCs on Solana as a foundation for projects to distribute NFTs to one of the most dedicated communities in crypto.\n\n**Participation & Launch Details**\n\nThe “first come, first served” model prevalent in NFT drops today is not perfect. Dedicated community members who supported projects from the start have the cards stacked against them. It is a race determined by sophisticated bots and internet latency.\n\nInitially, Raydium’s DropZone will include the following features:\n\n1\\) **Time-limited Participation: **NFT deposits will open at a set date for a short window of time where the community can deposit SOL in exchange for a chance to win the rights to an allocation. The amount of SOL eligible for deposit will be limited per wallet address and determined by the size of the NFT collection.\n\nBy keeping the deposit window short, dedicated community members that deposit on time will have a higher probability of winning an allocation than if deposits were longer. Short deposit windows also maintain much of the hype and buzz that’s generated from “first come, first served” NFT project drops.\n\n2\\) **On-chain Lottery: **An on-chain lottery will be carried out immediately after pools close. Once the lottery is complete, users will be able to claim their NFT allocation and remove their SOL for any tickets that did not win.\n\n*Example: Raydium is launching a collection of 5,000 NFT sunglasses, let’s call them RAY-Bans, for our community to show off at upcoming music festivals this #SolanaSummer. 1 pair of RAY-Bans are 1 SOL and the Raydium team has decided to limit deposits to 3 SOL. Alice is hitting the festival scene this summer and deposits 3 SOL, her maximum. Bob is still saving up for his ticket and only deposits 1 SOL. When the lottery ends, Alice has 2 winning tickets and can claim the NFT allocation for her 2 winning tickets and 1 SOL for her non-winning ticket. Bob does not have a winning NFT allocation and can claim his 1 SOL, better luck next time Bob.*\n\n3\\) **Transferable “Drop Box” NFTs:**\n\nOnce a DropZone lottery concludes:\n\n*   Users with a winning ticket will be able to claim a special Raydium NFT, or “Drop Box”, to their wallet which represents their allocation.\n*   This “Drop Box” NFT can then be redeemed on the project’s website to mint one original NFT from the project collection at random.\n\nEach project launch will feature exclusive “Drop Box” NFTs only redeemable for that project’s NFT collection. However, for the relevant NFT launch, the “Drop Box” NFTs will be transferable and interchangeable. Each will also include co-branded artwork between Raydium and the NFT project viewable on Phantom or other Solana NFT platforms.\n\nBy managing NFT distribution in this way, the infrastructure needed for an NFT launch, and the traffic and network stress associated with it, will be reduced for projects.\n\n*Example: Alice redeemed 1 “Drop Box” token and got an awesome pair of RAY-bans. Alice realizes she is happy with 1 pair. Alice lists her remaining Drop Box on a Serum Market for 1.5 SOL. Bob, who did not win a RAY-ban Drop Box, buys it and redeems it on the project website. Lookin’ good, Bob!*\n\n4\\) **Anti-Phishing & Anti-Bot: **The Drop Box token can be redeemed on the project website using a project-specific minting tool and prevents fake sites from stealing SOL. At the same time, Raydium will deploy bot prevention measures aimed at ensuring a fair launch.\n\nWe’re psyched about these initial features and what they offer for NFT projects building on Solana. However, we will continue to adapt and may adjust and evolve these plans according to changes in the space, requirements from projects, and feedback from the community.\n\n**Future Momentum**\n\nRaydium’s DropZone aims to help accelerate and simplify the drop process for NFT projects so teams can focus less on the infrastructure of launching and more on building value for their communities. We’re also super excited to be able to provide the Raydium community with access to the biggest NFT drops on Solana. The Raydium team recognizes the role NFTs play in the growth of the Solana ecosystem and we can’t wait to get involved!\n\nAnnouncements on the first DropZone launch are coming soon!

Big Rewards for ALPACA Holders!", "body": "[![Huacayachief](https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1\\*9TUoNvCiq9fiwH7T3qalQw.jpeg)](https://huacayachief.medium.com/?source=post_page-----6ff5b60fc04--------------------------------)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PYEZwtdpiUdafn190EJmGg.jpeg)\n\nDear alpacas,\n\nThis is our first of a new type of Grazing Range pool, a long-term pool that will be available not for only 1 or 2 months, but for many months to come! Or even years! In this case, it’s for the lifetime of the token emissions from our new partner [Scientix](https://scientix.finance/#/)! In other words, ALPACA holders will be eligible to receive **5% of all SCIX tokens!**\n\nNow, let’s get into the details of the partnership and Scientix, a new project on BSC we’re very excited about.\n\n> Scientix is a future-yield-backed synthetic asset platform on Binance Smart Chain. It allows you to get interest-free loans that pay themselves off over time with no liquidation risk, while your collateral earns you yields in the background!\n\nHow does it work? It’s quite simple.\n\n1.  When you deposit assets *(BUSD for now) *on Scientix, you can collateralize those assets to **borrow scUSD without interest.**\n2.  Because scUSD is a mirrored synthetic stablecoin pegged to BUSD, your loan can **never be liquidated.**\n3.  At the same time, your BUSD collateral will be deployed into Alpaca Finance’s lending vault to **earn you yields!**\n4.  Then, over time, the yields generated will automatically **repay your debt for you!**\n\n*(\\*You can also pay back a portion or the full loan amount at any time to claim the corresponding collateral)*\n\nWe know, it does sound like mad science. The kind of revolutionary financial science that earns you mad profits!\n\nWhat’s more is that our herd will also receive tremendous benefits. With this partnership, the Alpaca community will be able to stake ibALPACA on the Grazing Range page to receive **5% of the entire Scientix token (SCIX) supply in perpetuity!**\n\nThat is to say that unlike previous Grazing Range pools, there is no fixed end date for this campaign. The Alpaca community will continue to enjoy the 5% allocation from SCIX’s fair launch emission. So if you support the Herd, support Scientix!\n\nMost importantly, our pool will be online when Scientix launches their product and token using a **Fair Launch. **Like Alpaca, they had** no presale, no premine, and no investor. **That means that for you ibALPACA stakers in the Scientix Grazing Range pool, you will be the **first to get the SCIX tokens! **Making it not too different from a free **pre-launch airdrop!**\n\nWhen considering that you’ll be getting these tokens as SCIX first lists on PancakeSwap at a low price, that also means the SCIX token’s price has a lot of potential upside. Wouldn’t it have been nice if you got ALPACA at listing price? Now is your chance to do that with SCIX!\n\nThat’s why we’re really looking forward to this pool in particular, and the rest of the Herd should be too. 🤩\n\nThe pool will go live on approx. **September 13th, 2021 at \\~2 PM GMT (**[**block# 10880500**](https://bscscan.com/block/countdown/10880500)**), **when the SCIX token deploys.\n\n## Exclusive NFT Cards for Pool’s Stakers\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*RqDo08t3UU89WfOIXwpsDA.png)\n\nAs with all Grazing Ranges, this one will also have exclusive NFTs for stakers. To be eligible, you must stake ibALPACA in the SCIX Grazing Range pool before **September 14th, 2 PM GMT (1 day after the pool opens) and stake until at least October 11th, 10 AM GMT (for 27 days).** The NFT tier you receive will be based on the amount of ibALPACA staked.\n\n*   **Green Tier: **staked at least 500 ibALPACA\n*   **Silver Tier: **staked at least 5,000 ibALPACA\n*   **Gold Tier: **staked at least 50,000 ibALPACA\n\nUnlike other Grazing Ranges, the emissions on this pool will not decrease weekly, but will follow Scientix’ fair launch emissions schedule, which they will release shortly and is scheduled to last \\~3 years.\n\n## 🔒Security Scorecard on SCIX\n\n## Have the contracts been audited by professional auditing firms?\n\nYes, our smart contracts have been audited by two professional firms: Inspex and Secbit. You can view our audit reports through the links below:\n\n[**Inspex**](https://app.inspex.co/library/scientix#?scope=scientix-stakingpool-vault-strategy-votingescrow)** **· [**Secbit**](https://github.com/sec-bit/scientix-audit-report/blob/main/Scientix_Protocol_Report_EN.pdf)\n\n## What is the project’s inception date?\n\nThe project will launch on September 13th, 2021. However, we have worked on the project since April of this year.\n\n## Has your project ever been involved with a hack or exploit?\n\nWe have never been involved in a hack or exploit. Our code was forked from Alchemix, whose platform has been operating steadily with high TVL on Ethereum for most of this year.\n\n## What safety measures are in place to secure your protocol from centralization risk? What contracts are not under timelock? Who has multi-sig?\n\nThe Scientix DAO will begin as a DAO multi-sig, where 4 out of 5 signatures are needed. The core signers of the DAO are 2 members from the SCIX team, 2 members from the Alpaca team, and 1 independent co-signer: Calvin Chu (<https://twitter.com/calchulus>).\n\nThe timelock contract will play the admin role. The main functions are queueTransaction and executeTransaction. They can only be called by the Scientix DAO, and they must exceed minimum delay.\n\n## Does your token have a maximum supply cap?\n\nThe total supply of SCIX is 1.313 million. As it stands, no new SCIX tokens will be minted, though after the supply has been exhausted, the community can vote on whether to modify the total supply limit.\n\n## Mint function. If the token does not have a maximum supply, how is the mint function controlled?\n\nThe mint permission will be given to the farm contract after the project goes live, and the contract will only be distributed according to the set value.\n\nOnce our supply limit has been reached, the only way to mint additional tokens will be through a DAO governance vote.\n\n## Centralized treasury. If the protocol collects fees, where do they go and how are they controlled? Is there any kind of treasury or insurance fund under centralized control?\n\n10% of the yields earned are collected as fees and go into the treasury. All of them will go to veSCIX stakers, which is the governance token given to stakers of SCIX in the lockup governance vault.\n\n## Migration Function. Is there a migration function in the code? Why is this there and how to control this function from making a malicious action?\n\nThere are migration functions for vault in Scientix.sol and TransumterB.sol. They are for vault upgrading and only controlled by multi-sig DAO, which will be replaced by fully on-chain DAO.\n\n## Upgradeable contracts. Are the contracts upgradeable? Why is this there and how to control this function from making a malicious action?\n\nStratAlpaca, SimpleVault, StakingPool and VotingEscrow are upgradeable contracts, which can only be upgraded through the multi-sig DAO. If there will be any new changes made to the contract, the contract will need to be redeployed.\n\n## Third-party risk. What underlying external parties do your contracts rely on?\n\nWe currently rely on Alpaca Finance’s deposit vault contract. However, Alpaca Finance is regarded as one of the safest protocols on BSC with 11 completed security audits. Hence, we believe our third-party contract risk is minimal.\n\n## Where are tokens currently listed?\n\nPancakeSwap\n\n## Please briefly describe the utility of your tokens and all the relevant tokenomics (e.g. burn, staking, locking, etc.).\n\nThe SCIX token is our governance token. In addition to governance, SCIX can also be deposited on our Farm page to earn rewards in SCIX, including 11% of SCIX token emission and 100% of protocol earnings for locking up in the governance vault. Alternatively, you can also earn SCIX rewards by using the tokens to provide liquidity and stake the LP tokens on our Farm page.\n\n## Does your token have any advanced mechanics such as deflationary/rebase/reflexive?\n\nNo\n\n## Please share your project’s roadmap\n\n<https://docs.scientix.finance/our-protocol/roadmap>\n\n## What % of the token supply is/will be controlled by the team\n\nThe development team will receive 25% of the distributed rewards while ALPACA token holders will receive 5% of the distributed rewards.\n\n## What % of the token supply is controlled by investors? What is the token distribution model?\n\nScientix is a fair launch project, meaning there is no pre-sale or pre-mining. Below is how our tokens are allocated:\n\n**Farming Incentives**: 55%.\\\n**Development Team:** 25%\\\n**Strategic Expenses**: 14%\\\n**Incentives to ibALPACA Holders**: 5%\\\n**Multi-sig Holders:** 1%\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1\\*PvCFuFGT9DEMrfPt3ETgPg.png)\n\n## Please share the profiles of key team members\n\nWe are a group of DeFi developers based in Silicon Valley with years of tech industry experience.\n\n## What monitoring or controls do you have in place that could catch issues, halt functions, or delay attacks to protect assets?\n\nIf there’s a failure (i.e. a safety incident), we will halt the transfer and the deposit function until the issue is resolved and operations can resume safely.\n\n## Do you have a bug bounty program in place/planned?\n\nYes, will allocate a portion of SCIX token received from operations to launch our bug bounty program. We will join Immunefi for our Bug Bounty program.\n\n## Safety practices. Is there someone dedicated to security on the team? Does your git include your test/QA scripts? Describe your current IS/QA processes? Will you commit to auditing your code at least quarterly/semi-annually/annually and for major updates and releases?\n\nThere are at least two solidity and security experts who are in charge of reviewing code and protocol security. The codes were rigorously tested by a suite of unit tests and dedicated QAs. In addition, any future updates or releases will be audited.\n", "timestamp": 1633850395, "digest": "sK8NkgBLlqoGXwwuCz0LksBno29i9NkHQPMR0sfGf6o", "contributor": "0x6f3c06b4c50B17b4CEAA9d609356Ebd57963D011"}

In September, an average of 1.71 million active wallet addresses (uaws) were connected to the blockchain DAPP every day, resulting in an average of 1.54 million active wallet addresses every day in this quarter. This figure increased by 25% over the previous quarter and 487% year-on-year, which is impressive.\n\nReview of DAPP market in the third quarter: chain tour is booming and the multi chain of defi is accelerating\n\nOne of the main drivers of the steady growth of the industry is the game DAPP. The play and earn (p2e) model has attracted millions of users on multiple public chains. Game DAPP attracted an average of 754000 active wallet addresses per day in the third quarter, an increase of 140% over the previous quarter. Blockchain networks such as hive, BSC and wax have benefited from the p2e trend.\n\nBy analyzing the new dapps launched in recent months, the number of game categories has increased significantly. NFT and game dapps have been rising since June. On the other hand, the launch of defi dapps has decreased significantly. Nevertheless, the data confirm that the use of DAPP in the blockchain industry is increasing.\n\nAlthough the DAPP usage of defi and NFT decreased slightly, for example, NFT DAPP had an average of 102000 active wallets per day in this quarter, a slight decrease of 2% over the previous quarter. However, it is worth noting that using transaction volume to represent the NFT field may be a clearer indicator of status.\n\nThe growth of axie infinity\n\nAxie Infinity has another impressive quarter. Since turning to the solution of ronin side chain, the performance of the game is still excellent. Axie infinity had more than 1.5 million active users in the third quarter. In addition, the game generated more than $776 million in revenue in the third quarter.\n\nReview of DAPP market in the third quarter: chain tour is booming and the multi chain of defi is accelerating\n\nHowever, axie's most impressive \"milestone\" is related to trading volume. In September, axie's historical trading volume exceeded $2 billion, becoming the first in DAPP's history. At present, the historical transaction volume of axie Infinity has risen to $2.18 billion. From this perspective, the closest is cryptopunks, which is $800 million behind.\n\nReview of DAPP market in the third quarter: chain tour is booming and the multi chain of defi is accelerating\n\nAxie Infinity has become a pioneer in making money while playing (p2e), and the stacking of AXS pass has just started. The upcoming battle and land mechanism update will attract more players.\n\nBehind the NFT record\n\nThe past two months have been explosive growth for the NFT market. August was a record month, with a total trading volume of more than $5.2 billion in the NFT market. Throughout the third quarter, the NFT market generated more than $10.67 billion in trading volume. This is a significant increase of 704% over the previous quarter and 38060% year-on-year.\n\nReview of DAPP market in the third quarter: chain tour is booming and the multi chain of defi is accelerating\n\nBehind the excellent performance is not a single, but a variety of reasons. The field of NFT is fully evolving. The NFT project expands more use cases to make it more than a simple profile picture. In addition, some NFT collections are becoming brands. The addition of celebrities such as Snoop Dogg, Shaquille O'Neal and Steve Aoki further strengthened the social prospects of the NFT market.\n\nReview of DAPP market in the third quarter: chain tour is booming and the multi chain of defi is accelerating\n\nIn addition, NFT projects such as cryptopunks or bored ape Yacht Club (bayc) and the rise of the meta universe have pushed the NFT field to the mainstream. For example, in August, visa purchased cryptopunk for us $150000 #7610; In September, Sotheby's, a famous art, jewelry and collectibles brokerage company, successfully completed the auction of 101 bayc NFTs at a price of US $24.4 million.\n\nMainstream media coverage is expected to grow further. In recent months, Gucci, D & G; And Burberry and other top fashion brands have set foot in the field of NFT. D&G; On September 27, we completed the sales of characteristic digital fashion series, with a total sales of US $5.65 million.\n\nIn addition to the mainstream signals sent by celebrities and big brands, another aspect will become more and more important in the field of NFT: having the utility provided by NFT. Whether by obtaining additional NFT Awards (meebits, punks comic, etc.) or by generating passive income, these NFTs are looking for a way to reward the owners of digital art.\n\nFor example, projects such as cyberkongz and supducks provide passive income to holders through holding NFT of the platform. In cyberkongz's, kongz NFT holders receive 10 banana as revenue every day. At current banana prices, this is equivalent to $497 per day.\n\nWhen NFT collides with the game field, the role of NFT will become more important. NFT is one of the main pillars of blockchain games. Compared with traditional games, NFT allows chain game players to have real ownership of their game items. In the third quarter, in-game items generated $2.3 billion in trading volume, which accounted for 22% of the total NFT! It can be seen that the game is producing real synergy with NFT.\n\nReview of DAPP market in the third quarter: chain tour is booming and the multi chain of defi is accelerating\n\nStatus quo of defi\n\nAlthough most of the spotlights in the encryption market are attracted by NFT and games, the panorama in the defi competition becomes more interesting. At the end of the third quarter, the total lock up value (TVL) of the defi field was about US $178.12 billion, of which 92.37% (US $166.38 billion) were locked in six public chains. Compared with the end of the previous quarter, TVL in the defi field increased by 104%, reaching a peak of $195 billion on September 6.\n\nReview of DAPP market in the third quarter: chain tour is booming and the multi chain of defi is accelerating\n\n虽然以太坊在 TVL 方面仍然是领先的区块链，但索拉纳、Terra 和雪崩的进展堪称典范。与其他几个网络一样，索拉纳直接受益于以太坊高交易成本的劣势。索拉纳的TVL已达82.8亿美元，比上一季度增长1300%。仅考虑 TVL，索拉纳目前是第三大公共连锁店。\n\n第三季度DAPP市场回顾：连锁旅游蓬勃发展，多链条的完善正在加速\n\nTerra 已成为 TVL 中第四大不公开连锁店。它拥有业内交易量最大的稳定货币之一，即Terra USD（UST）。目前，Terra的TVL为80.9亿美元，环比增长137%。Terra 的缺陷生态系统有四个 TVL 达普， 价值超过 10 亿美元。例如，收入优化器主播的 TVL 已超过 30 亿美元，而 Terra 的丽都则超过 25 亿美元。我们可以仍然对Terra网络中存在缺陷的可能性持乐观态度。\n\n第三季度DAPP市场回顾：连锁旅游蓬勃发展，多链条的完善正在加速\n\n硬币安全智能链 （BSC） 是第二大公共链。BSC 的 TVL 为 177.8 亿美元，比上一季度增长 9.98%。虽然 BSC 用户将注意力转向游戏型 DAPP，但公共链条的 TVL 仍在上升。\n\n第三季度DAPP市场回顾：连锁旅游蓬勃发展，多链条的完善正在加速\n\nBSC 最重要的缺点之一是煎饼唤醒，这是 BSC 用户最常用的 DAPP。第三季度末，煎饼的TVL为87.1亿美元，较上一季度增长39.83%。该应用程序在过去30天有306万个活跃的钱包地址，环比增加了21%。煎饼唤醒的前景是光明的，因为DAPP正在推出自己的NFT系列，可以在同一平台上交易。毫无疑问，煎饼是 BSC 的\"皇冠上的珍珠\"。\n\n多边形的DFI前景似乎不像三个月前那么乐观。目前，多边形的TVL为30.2亿美元，超过陆地，索拉纳和雪崩在这个季度。\n\n第三季度DAPP市场回顾：连锁旅游蓬勃发展，多链条的完善正在加速\n\n总结\n\n在观察了第三季度加密市场的发展之后，有很多理由可以兴奋。正如达普拉德首席执行官斯基曼塔斯•贾努斯卡斯（skirmantas Januskas）指出的，\"区块链行业在上个季度取得了相当可观的业绩——25%的活跃钱包地址增长绝非易事。但真正让人尖叫的是\"达普斯已经获得了游戏\"的发展，态度的改变和新趋势在短短三个月内。\n\n\"多样化意味着更多的使用案例，而更多的使用案例意味着更多的采用。这个行业正在扩张。加密不仅是投资组合中的一篮子资产，而且还开始渗透到日常生活中。", "timestamp": 1633850956, "digest": "-vFzSQ6-tjCyD42iDEFtBkPcyjpXhBNisiyOPP-wOF0", "contributor": "0x12a72800D8588D7Cc95f1b381fb9589b299B7ca4"}

We didn’t realize it at the time but it basically freed millions of individuals from the wrath of the nation state. \n\nI feel grateful to be in a country that has incredibly high return on investment. The companies being built here are transformational. Impacting the world. Just getting immersed into start-up nation. \n\nBuilding on Arbitrum. What a world. Building on Starknet. You can’t compete with it. It’s all better on Eth. Why invest in anything else. You have Starkware. It’s not as quick but maybe it is now. I need to understand the tech cycle here and what is possible vs. what is unrealistc. \n\nThis is an insane amount of vegetation entering my consciousness. I’m super grateful for this moment. For this food. But even more so for the opportunity to take vacation. Just taking some time off from the agitated race of progress. It’s going to be something I work on. But slowing down. Appreciating nature. Being kind and friendly and dancing. \n\nI”m really grateful for the G-d flooding in today. Grateful for dinner last night. It made me feel kind of bad in the moment. The rockiness. It wasn’t incredibly comfortable but I also going through some emotional stuff before hand and during the day. I just didn’t protect myself from that period energy. I’m lucky to be with Hannah but she is really lucky to have you. I still see that as a place of judgement. Not as peers. \n\nI don’t want to say I’m “educated”. I’m educated in my own way. I do want to appreciate parts of her that I honestly appreciate and don’t force / contrive it. But yea I wonder if I can do that brainstorming without Adar. \n\nWe gotta get a sick NFT artist to just help us monetize the community / grow what we have. Just being there early is what makes all the difference. I need to use these airdrop platforms. First need to prioritize. \n\nFoundations and Endowments. \n\nBanks and Insurance Companies. \n\nI think we’ve had quite a fucking season in the past few centuries. What incredible creativity. Mind numbing. Straight up beyond stunning. Beyond nuts. Beyond possible. The most insane thing is happening. Humans are evolving. Humanity is evolving. We are changing. Like we always do. This house is a fucking palace. Just a fricken palace. So incredibly beautiful. Charming. Sweet. Enjoyable. \n\nBeing a non U.S. resident I was able to use the platform. It’s gone. There’s no contractual obligation to repay them. I loved Costa Rica. So much. So much unlocking. So much unblocking. So much blockchaining. Throwing crypto parties. Cost 1 Eth to attend. Cost 1 BTC to attend. Cost 1 Dopex. \n\nRibbon is live and trading. Not a ton. I can earn tokens and then the price will just go down over time, not up. If it doesn’t go up, people won’t use the platform. If usage just depresses the price of the token. You need to grow sustainably. People will take their liquidity elsewhere. It’s a great advantage to have that liquidity up front. \n\nUsing discord to solve crazy problems. Making the server culture work. Just a moment. How to use these different technologies. I just need to use these products all the time and help them get better. I want to just use a bunch of products and get fluent with the new capabilities enabled by Blockchain. I think you can pay me to just do research on certain topics. You can crowdfund my work. You will own that research and you can monetize my work to other VCs and founders. \n\nSo airdrop farming is competitive and good competitions give lots of people an opportunity. If you are found to be representing different wallets - you will be doxxed and the community can vote to censor you? No. That’s not good. It’s amazing to wolt.

And these SSRIs are 1A agonist, a fancy term for saying \"it stimulates the 1A\".\n\n### What's happens when 1A is stimulated?\n\nYou go back to work, you boss is still a prick, but you have changed somehow. You, you are more accepting of the situation. You accept the fact that it's the way of life and it's how it is and no point being depressed and being hard on yourself. And you live life, as it is.\n\nWith your 1A stimulated, you become a stoic. Sure you become less depressed, not by means of actions, but my means of accepting the way life is to you.", "timestamp": 1633854090, "digest": "bD8hv3oYGxyHhlrYOAvxtIRor2huyClVzw7wC0I8Vfs", "contributor": "0x7CDc2D6F8A94FfCC4fa500fE6EeC91418925b9a4"}
