So how should new crypto founders start getting traction?  How does that traction inform other functions like product?  And what unique considerations does crypto introduce to traditional go-to-market?  This post will attempt to answer some of those questions.\n\n### Background\nThere’s a lot to love in crypto.  New experiments and breakthroughs in engineering, game theory, monetary policy, capital markets, political philosophy, memes, etc.  All happening in the open and evolving at breakneck speeds.  But there is a risk that all the activity isn’t driving the results that matter in terms of user adoption.  Quantifying this risk, compare the number of active crypto developers to virtually any traditional dev platform:\n- **Crypto:** 350 Bitcoin devs; 900 DeFi devs; 2,400 Ethereum devs ([Electric Capital](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2020-9417165c6444)). \n- **Traditional Tech:** 2M using Docker; 5M using Twilio; 12M using JavaScript ([Slash Data](https://www.1milliondeveloperclub.com/)).\n\nAdmittedly, the comparison is imperfect.  Crypto [isn’t singularly](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1048301983109668864?s=20) a web development tool and the crypto data excludes substantial closed-source projects like exchanges, miners and wallets.  Furthermore, crypto *is* delivering impressive metrics, many unique to crypto in both category (e.g., hash rates, miner fees) and their radical public availability (on-chain transactions).  But eventually, the dev numbers and resulting end users will need to materialize for crypto to cross the chasm to the mainstream.\n\nThis post will focus on three areas to help teams think through gaining traction:\n- **Product:** How to align core product and adoption strategy.\n- **Audience:** How to identify target users.\n- **Execution:** And how to optimize when launching a product.\n\nIn addition, this post is intended to be helpful for crypto-native projects (L1’s, L2’s, on-chain applications) whose primary audience are developers vs. more consumer-driven applications that incorporate crypto (Square Cash, Robinhood) but likely benefit more from traditional growth approaches.  \n\nCrypto-native projects are in relatively uncharted waters when it comes to adoption, hence “incomplete” in the title of this post.  Feedback on Twitter [add link] on things that should be added for future versions of this playbook is greatly appreciated.\n\n\n### Product\nMost decisions are path dependent on core product, meaning the product’s nature will determine the most important choices (vision, goals, culture).  It’s worth being very clear upfront about what the product is trying to achieve.  In crypto in particular, what the product expresses directly informs how and why it gets adopted.  For example, Bitcoin’s mission, as self-sovereign money or however it’s interpreted, is front and center in its adoption [even as it gains mainstream attention](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/bitcoin/documents/stone-ridge-2020-shareholder-letter) far from its cypherpunk roots.  One exercise to articulate the product vision is through the lens of subversion which is [embedded](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/133/tree/trunk/main.cpp#l1613\n) in crypto’s DNA.  Understanding what you’re subverting is a useful tool in articulating the new world the product will introduce (e.g., Bitcoin subverting trust in financial institutions or Uniswap subverting exchange rent extraction).\n\nAny adoption strategy’s primary goal is to inform and improve the product, with a growing and increasingly engaged user base as an externality of the better product.  Feedback cycles in crypto can be especially powerful.  While it’s common for early users of traditional web services to get rewarded through incentives and subsidies, with crypto, users have a direct ownership stake in the product.  This alignment creates fervent engagement that is especially useful to early stage projects where the feedback process can be an end in its own right.  One of my favorite examples where you see this in action is in incentivized testnets that [Cosmos’ Game of Stakes](https://github.com/cosmos/game-of-stakes) nailed and as a result became part of the network launch playbook (Celo’s the Great Stake Off, Near’s Stake Wars).\n\nIn addition, a successful adoption strategy should eventually become embedded and find its home in the product itself.  You see this in several crypto projects where their target audience is explicitly expressed in the product, namely in how they abstract crypto’s complexity with interfaces tailored to specific developer groups such as game devs ([Flow](https://www.onflow.org/) and [Forte](https://www.forte.io/)) and artists ([Zora](https://zora.co/) and [Foundation](https://foundation.app/)).\n\n\n### Audience\nIf you don’t know who you’re building for, you don’t know what you’re building.  But there is an inherent bind in defining target users: if you’re building something new, then the user base has yet to be aggregated by the product.  You don’t really know who wants to be a [taxi driver](https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/us/famous-uber-drivers/index.html) until it’s accessible.  There are two common ways to address this dilemma, both riddled with challenges:\n- *The first* is to default to yourself as the target user and extrapolate this to your broader community.  There’s a seductive honesty to scratching your own itch.  It also complements crypto’s early stage.  Crypto is riddled with glaring UX challenges that will eventually become someone’s opportunity.  The challenge with this approach is that it risks objectivity.  Your itch may be so idiosyncratic that no meaningful number of people experience it and you’ve failed to right-size the market.  A common reaction to this is to default to the nearest adjacent community where there’s an even greater risk that the proposition is second rate (e.g., competing L1’s sponsoring an ETH hackathon).\n- *The second* is the opposite - default to the largest possible addressable market.  For example, there are [24 million](https://evansdata.com/press/viewRelease.php?pressID=278) developers in the world that could build on crypto if only this new tool you’re building.  Success means AWS is your oyster.  But this risks diluting the product.  An incumbent may find some discrete value in using crypto but their incentives lie in protecting existing business.  As a result, a direct relationship emerges between the intrenchment of a user and how marginal their application of crypto becomes (e.g., I struggle to come up with a better example of a marginal application than [avocado tracking](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3247758/maersk-ibm-create-worlds-first-blockchain-based-electronic-shipping-platform.html)).  One way to manage this risk is to build with a highly specific use case in mind that is underserved by existing solutions (e.g., creator monetization).  This removes the broad scattershot approach of targeting a mainstream audience with an effective wedge or insertion point.  Ultimately however, non-native audiences will struggle with the awkwardness in crypto’s most basic mechanics (e.g., funding an on-chain wallet) so the mission becomes some version of [make everyone crypto native](https://twitter.com/saturnial/status/1344381833379627009).\n\nBut there’s good news.  Crypto products have an inherent competitive advantage: the lack of an [established community](https://blakeir.com/Alex-Zhu-TikTok-4631f80fdcc4423a845e145e807d8e2b) is a growth opportunity for new users.  This means ruthlessly targeting users whose number one priority is growth.  Bonus points if existing solutions have actively hindered their growth.  For example, banks deplatforming crypto exchanges was Tether’s opportunity.  Now that the growth opportunity for crypto exchanges has materialized, banks [compete](https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-gemini-first-crypto-exchange-customers-jpmorgan-bank-report) to service exchanges and Tether liquidity is through the roof.  Targeting high growth users is hard because at first, the audience will appear small or non-existent.  But taking a risk on your customers is the best way to get rewarded by them in turn.  So, how do you identify high growth users?\n- Pay attention to users who are “all-in” on your product.  All-in means they build natively on the platform, with all core functions of their applications living on-chain.  Crypto networks are multisided (users, liquidity providers, developers, etc.) and network effects have the best chance of taking off when all application logic is publicly available.  This enables third-parties to build custom [UIs](https://zora.gallery/), [plug-ins](https://plugins.zkga.me/) and entirely new applications built on top.  Early on, the all-in developers look like idiosyncratic enthusiasts.  But long term, these initial insiders become a powerful distribution engine (developer relations, support, content, memes, etc.)  You can see this in action as most platforms exhibit the Pareto Principle where 80% of activity comes from 20% of users.  Crypto follows this as well.  As [Electric Capital’s](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2020-9417165c6444) graph demonstrates below, becoming a top crypto project (1,000+ active devs) can be broken down to winning over 100 all-in developers.  Driving a small but passionate core is more valuable than a large but barely engaged mass.\n![Crypto developers by frequency of contribution, Electric Capital](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fa86a9b3-67e0-4ccb-a4c4-7007f6029f5e.jpeg?height=1619&width=2880)\n- Another way to identify high growth users is to aggregate the longtail of some fragmented behavior.  This dynamic appears not once but twice in AMMs.  First, while AMMs look like an overly simplified mechanism to a professional trader, there was a longtail market of users looking to provide liquidity if it was easier.  Second, there are a longtail of token projects seeking liquidity but are unable to access traditional exchanges.  Empowering longtail audiences aligns incredibly well with crypto’s permissionless architecture.  Democratizing access, where every user has root access, is crypto’s superpower.  Also, if longtail users are successful, the opportunity will become too big for mainstream users to ignore.\n\n\n### Execution\nThere will be many ideas on how to go about gaining adoption and the problem will be that many of the ideas are pretty good.  One tool to sort ideas is timing: while the idea makes sense, probing whether it makes sense right now can surface the right decision.  Some ways to think about timing:\n- **Internal:** Is the team or product ready?  Do we have the resources to support the idea effectively and make it successful?  There are already great lessons in crypto about [sequencing](https://variant.fund/progressive-decentralization-a-playbook-for-building-crypto-applications/) that projects like Compound have demonstrated.\n- **External:** Is the market ready?  Will the users show up and will they have sufficient motivation to grow together?  Given crypto’s brief but dense history, this factor is the reason you see many ideas resurface more successfully a few years later (DEXes, algorithmic stablecoins, even [loyalty points](https://www.lolli.com/)).\n\nAnother tool is simplicity.  Adoption strategies that work can be stated simply.  This allows them to scale across team members who understand it, partners who implement it, and users who repeat it.  As an example, Facebook’s adoption strategy to get to 1 billion users was essentially summed up as [“get any individual to 7 friends in 10 days.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1264&v=raIUQP71SBU&feature=youtu.be)\n\nAnd finally, be opportunistic.  When the product launches, pay attention to more emergent behaviors.  This is especially true in crypto where most projects are in fairly unchartered waters and signal will most likely come from unexpected sources.  This applies to more traditional considerations such as product / market fit but also challenges that are of particular focus in crypto such as community building.\n\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile we can see rays of light on crypto crossing the chasm, the playbook for crypto adoption is still being written.  The good news is that areas with unwritten playbooks have the best opportunities.  To recap:\n- All decisions are path dependent on the core product, including the adoption strategy.\n- Product feedback is the main goal of adoption.  Crypto can accelerate this.\n- Target users that want to grow at all costs and are all-in on your product.\n- On execution decisions, be aware of timing and simplicity.\n- Post launch, be opportunistic about emergent user behaviors.\n\nA big thank you to Ahmed Moor, [Alex Pruden](https://twitter.com/apruden08), [Asheesh Birla](https://twitter.com/ashgoblue), [Brett Seyler](https://twitter.com/relyes), [Georgios Konstantopoulos](https://twitter.com/gakonst), [Howard Wu](https://twitter.com/1HowardWu), [Joe Lallouz](https://twitter.com/JoeLallouz), [Maria Shen](https://twitter.com/MariaShen), [Nick Chirls](https://twitter.com/nchirls) and [Philipp Banhardt](https://twitter.com/pbanhardt) for their review and helpful contributions.", "timestamp": 1612393259, "digest": "qVp4ob8Skrrq4-TVlRiDvdxrJACt4s6fnVb3uarantQ", "contributor": "0xAed58605cF7d6A9396f7c0539D51df6763808208"}

Then, they bought high-value plots of virtual land in [Cryptovoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/), [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), and [Somnium Space](https://www.somniumspace.com/). \n\nThey hired VoxelArchitects, a professional design firm based in Portugal, to build virtual museums. Metapurse put the Beeple art pieces in these structures, bundled them together, and fractionalized ownership with a token called B20. On January 24, they hosted a launch party for the B20 token. Attendees sipped on virtual cocktails as [3LAU](https://twitter.com/3LAU) DJ’d the event.\n\n![[Metapalooza event (Source: Andrew Steinwold)](https://twitter.com/AndrewSteinwold/status/1353170059842236416)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/52c3ffd3-ad73-4091-b917-1de9982e55f3.jpeg?height=343&width=680)\n\n**A Community Around NFTs**\n\nThe social token [WHALE](https://forefront.news/creators/whale) is a great case study of a community built around NFTs. [WhaleShark](https://twitter.com/WhaleShark_Pro) owned several NFTs that he placed in a [vault](https://opensea.io/accounts/the_vault). He then issued $WHALE, a social token backed by the NFTs in the vault. If you owned the token, you got access to the WHALE community. The token’s value is driven by the NFT vault, Whale’s brand, community size and engagement, industry leadership via the community’s NFT expertise, and various mechanisms for ROI. It is one of the most successful social tokens today in terms of market cap ($30 million), community size (over 1,000 Discord members), and community engagement.\n\n**Money Legos Meet Media Legos**\n\nAfter spending enough time in crypto, you start to understand that everything is related. Store of value, stablecoins, DeFi, NFTs, social tokens, and DAOs seem like distinct categorizations. But they all come together.\n\n[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/), a crypto-native publishing platform, is [experimenting](https://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ) with monetizing written content through NFTs. In this model, content is tradable as an NFT with fractional ownership, allowing multiple people to own a small stake. Fractional ownership is enabled using ERC-20 tokens. \n\nContributors who fund the project receive a stake in the sales of the NFT. The primary reason someone would want to fund a piece of writing is patronage - supporting work you think is important. Participants in the crowdfund will be embedded in the essay. Second, you build reputation as an early backer of important work. Third, you get revenue if the work becomes popular and the NFT is sold for a higher price to new buyers. In the future, the creator could operate a DAO that produces many works, each minted as an NFT. Revenue from sales would accrue to the DAO.\n\n![Internet Renaissance (Source: Zora)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eae657db-b923-4a5c-bc35-fee0d970a44c.jpeg?height=506&width=680)\n\n**Status**\n\nEugene Wei [analyzes](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service) social networks across three axes: utility, entertainment, and status. For social networks to reach sufficient scale to provide utility, they need to build in status games into the network.\n\nWe are in the early days of effectively incorporating status in crypto. Crypto people [obnoxiously](https://twitter.com/Shaughnessy119/status/1345743115127304193) flex their crypto gains because subtler flexing mechanisms aren't built out yet. In traditional finance, people flex by wearing Armani suits and buying tickets to Hamilton. As the metaverse gets built out, crypto people will flex with conspicuous digital consumption. NFTs will become an important way to seek and display status.\n\nStatus is particularly volatile, more volatile than wealth. Maintaining status requires managing scarcity. Watching Hamilton was high status when there were a limited number of Broadway shows. It became low status when it could be streamed by millions on Disney+. Products that intuitively understand and manage status volatility will do well in NFT markets.\n\n**Problems with NFTs & the Metaverse Today**\n\nFirst, token IDs are scarce but metadata is [not scarce](https://outpost-protocol.com/jamm/post/lbH2RrWaSHjBAVRg40vJJ5T00sZtwIWsmKA3Jg2flis). Multiple NFTs can be minted from the same metadata. If platforms like Rarible have to verify the authenticity of a creator, the work cannot live across platforms.\n\nSecond, metaverse experiences are low-fidelity today. Michael Nielsen [writes](https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1261660319295799297), “Interacting with a roughly 10 inch size device using the tips of your fingers and your eyes is (a) taking advantage of almost none of your body's capacity for movement or sensation; and (b) taking advantage of almost none of your environment.” We should be able to integrate more of our body, senses, and physical world with computing. It’s hard to have metaverse experiences today that are as tactile and engaging as, say, cooking or painting.\n\n**Implications of the Metaverse**\n\n> \"Instead of violent wars, there could be violent video games; instead of heroic feats, there could be thrilling amusement park rides; instead of serious thought, there could be 'intrigues of all sorts', as in a soap opera. It is a world where people spend their lives amusing themselves to death.\" - Peter Thiel.\n\n\nIt is possible that the metaverse becomes so engaging and entertaining that it distracts us from important things in the physical world. We still need to build and fix physical things, develop meaningful relationships with our family and local community, solve biological ageing, and explore the frontiers of our physical universe.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOver the next few years, people will be able to truly own more digital assets. Creators and communities will be able to capture more of the value that they create. We will build out various components of the metaverse and hopefully ensure that the digital goods and experiences we create are interoperable between platforms.\n\nIf you have thoughts on this essay, [DM](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas) me on Twitter.
