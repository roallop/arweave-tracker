We're using crypto to crowdfund a bounty to bring reserve auction functionality to MintFund.\n\n[Crowdfund Embed](crowdfund://0x61415051B760ECb390376A0626826873b286e65E?softCap=5&endsAt=1615990063)\n\nReserve auctions have seen significant traction as a mechanism for selling NFTs, but they have typically been limited to proprietary marketplaces. MintFund's mission is to expand opportunity for artists hoping to break out into the crypto art scene. Part of that mission is providing open access to best-in-class tools that artists need to thrive.\n\nToday, we're launching a Mirror crowdfund contract to create a bounty for a talented Solidity developer to implement a robust and completely permissionless version of reserve auctions for NFTs. Unlike the previous $ESSAY and $VALUE campaigns, the output of this bounty will be _written code_ instead of _written text_.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a29d398d-ed50-4d20-a804-d1c89d3138be.jpeg?height=674&width=1200)\n\n## How it Works\n\n*   The bounty crowdfund has a hard-cap of 7 ETH\n*   Backers can send ETH to the crowdfund in exchange for $BOUNTY tokens\n*   If the funding target is hit, MintFund will hire a talented Solidity developer from the Ethereum community to implement the fully open-source smart contracts\n*   The codebase will be posted on Mirror as permanent, public data and mirrored on GitHub\n*   The codebase will be minted as an NFT on the Zora protocol, representing the first digitally unique and collectible codebase\n*   The final cd will be deployed on mainnet and used to auction off this NFT\n*   If the NFT is sold, ETH will accrue to $BOUNTY tokens\n*   $BOUNTY tokens can be traded like any ERC-20 token, or redeemed for underlying ETH\n*   Participants in the crowdfund will be embedded in the code base forever as the supporters who made it possible\n\n25% of **$BOUNTY** tokens will be retained by mint fund and 5% will go to the developer, the remaining 70% will be distributed to **$BOUNTY** backers.\n\n\n## The Power of Reserve Auctions\nSince the advent of NFT transactions, reserve auctions have seen significant traction as a mechanism for selling NFTs. The hype, the intrigue, and the status involved in a singular moment in time where everyone's eyes are fixed upon a particular drop provides a narrative for all the artists who have sold work. Reserve auctions become a tool to connect both artist and collector, a story for communities to rally around—news to be told to the masses. They are a spotlight and turning point of an artist's career in the cryptosphere and we want to bring it to every artist. \nReserve auctions started on SuperRare and have moved to other marketplaces such as Nifty Gateway. However, with a platform like Zora the permissionless nature of the zNFT smart contracts allows anyone to extend the bidding protocol, making it a great fit to add a reserve auction extension. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e5a9ad06-718d-4540-b869-de4fa7d74737.jpeg?height=674&width=1200)\n\n## Why?\nWe believe that building the tools for creatives to push their best works unfettered by cost, access, and exposure yields the next generation of mind bending work and an ever growing community of shared talent, spirit, and wealth. \nMintFund is dedicated to giving all communities, with emphasis to BIPOC & LGBTQIA folks, the means to take cryptomedia / NFTs by storm and move culture along with them. \nWe recognize that the key to achieving our goal of launching life-changing creative careers on the blockchain is threefold: \n1. Cover gas fees to enable access to the tools to participate in the NFT ecosystem\n2. Create tools for artists to increase their exposure and connect with collectors\n3. Build a success-based funding source to ensure MintFund can continue to sustain its work without relying on donations\n\n\n## About the Bounty / Scope of Work\n\n### Requirements\n\n1. Any owner of a Zora NFT should be able to permissionlessly kick off an auction. Kicking off an auction should not require deploying a new contract.\n2. The auction should be configurable such that its constructor accepts (at minimum) two parameters\n    1. Reserve Price (amount + currency address)\n    2. Auction Duration (ex. 24 hours)\n3. The auction should be binding, such that at the end of the Auction the highest bid is automatically accepted and the NFT is transferred to the highest bid's recipient address.\n4. Bids on the auction are made in ETH and should be locked in escrow for the duration of the auction, but automatically returned if a higher bid is made.\n5. If the Auction has not received a bid higher than the reserve price, the original owner can withdraw the NFT. Once a bid has been placed, the NFT is locked until the auction is completed.\n6. Relevant events are emitted for each of the major function calls.\n\n\n### User Story\n\n1. Alice grants permission to transfer the NFT to the auction contract\n2. Calls `createAuction` with the tokenId, reservePrice, and creator address. This transfers the NFT to the contract.\n3. Craig submits a bid below the reserve price, but it reverts\n4. Bob calls `createBid` with a bid that is higher than the reserve price, which sets the currentBid to his address and amount.’ The contract receives Bob's ETH and holds it in escrow.\n5. Craig calls `endAuction`, but it reverts because the current block time doesn't exceed the Auction's end-time\n6. Danny calls `createBid`, which replaces Bob's bid as the current bid. Bob is refunded the ETH that he sent into the contract previously.\n7. No new bids come in, and the current block time exceeds the Auction's end-time\n8. Danny calls `endAuction`, which transfers the NFT to her address. Runs a payout according to the Zora market's BidShare data to send funds to the creator.\n\n\n### High Level Implementation Ideas\n\nEach **_Auction_** is described by the following data:\n*   **tokenId**: The Zora market token ID for the NFT\n*   **duration**: The number seconds that the auction runs for after the first bid, e.g. 24 hours, which is extended with each new bid\n*   **firstBidTime**: Unix timestamp of the first bid\n*   **reservePrice**: Allow the creator to set a reserve price, below which the auction will not settle and the NFT is returned\n*   **creator**: Keep track of the creator in case we need to return the NFT.\nA single auction contract keeps track of multiple auctions, via a simple mapping of **tokenId** to **Auction.** This contract also keeps track of the current **_Bids_** for each **Auction**. Bids are mapped from tokenId to bid. A bid is composed of:\n*   Bidder\n*   Amount\nThe contract has the following functionality:\n- **createAuction**(uint tokenId, uint reservePrice, address creator)\n    - Instantiates an **Auction** using the given parameters, and transfers the NFT to the contract itself, _so that the contract controls the NFT_\n    - **createBid** (uint amount, uint tokenId) external payable\n    - Checks that amount is greater than the current bid, and greater than the reserve price\n    - Check that the msg.value == amount\n    - \"Start the clock\" and increases the duration by \n    - Refund the previous bid\n- **endAuction**(uint tokenId)\n    *   Checks that the current time is greater than the end time\n    *   Transfers the NFT to the highest bidder, if there is one and is greater-or-equal the reserve price, else transfers back to the creator\n- **cancelAuction**(uint tokenId)\n    - Can only be called by the creator\n    - Checks if there are no bids\n    - Transfers the NFT back to the creator\n\n\n## What's Next?\n\nThis initiative, if executed successfully, will not only give new rise to creatives, but create a pipeline to mint their NFTs and expose them to the greater communities that have rallied around MintFund and our growing list of contributors and partners. \nMintFund will retain 5% of $BOUNTY. Proceeds will be used to offset the cost of minting NFTs for creators that are sponsored by MintFund and to provide resources and services to help creatives navigate the crypto ecosystem.\n\n## About Mint Fund.\n\nMintFund is a community project created with the sole purpose to build a support network for artists interested in bringing their art into the world of[ NFTs](https://linda.mirror.xyz/df649d61efb92c910464a4e74ae213c4cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d)/[cryptomedia.1](https://cryptomedia.wtf/)\nMintFund provides artists with the funds to mint NFTs (known as[ gas costs](https://kb.myetherwallet.com/en/transactions/what-is-gas/)), and offers guidance, mentorship and advice for the growing community of cryptomedia artists.

The hype, the intrigue, and the status involved in a singular moment in time where everyone's eyes are fixed upon a particular drop provides a narrative for all the artists who have sold work. Reserve auctions become a tool to connect both artist and collector, a story for communities to rally around—news to be told to the masses. They are a spotlight and turning point of an artist's career in the cryptosphere and we want to bring it to every artist. \nReserve auctions started on SuperRare and have moved to other marketplaces such as Nifty Gateway. However, with a platform like Zora the permissionless nature of the zNFT smart contracts allows anyone to extend the bidding protocol, making it a great fit to add a reserve auction extension. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e5a9ad06-718d-4540-b869-de4fa7d74737.jpeg?height=674&width=1200)\n\n## Why?\nWe believe that building the tools for creatives to push their best works unfettered by cost, access, and exposure yields the next generation of mind bending work and an ever growing community of shared talent, spirit, and wealth. \nMintFund is dedicated to giving all communities, with emphasis to BIPOC & LGBTQIA folks, the means to take cryptomedia / NFTs by storm and move culture along with them. \nWe recognize that the key to achieving our goal of launching life-changing creative careers on the blockchain is threefold: \n1. Cover gas fees to enable access to the tools to participate in the NFT ecosystem\n2. Create tools for artists to increase their exposure and connect with collectors\n3. Build a success-based funding source to ensure MintFund can continue to sustain its work without relying on donations\n\n\n## About the Bounty / Scope of Work\n\n### Requirements\n\n1. Any owner of a Zora NFT should be able to permissionlessly kick off an auction. Kicking off an auction should not require deploying a new contract.\n2. The auction should be configurable such that its constructor accepts (at minimum) two parameters\n    1. Reserve Price (amount + currency address)\n    2. Auction Duration (ex. 24 hours)\n3. The auction should be binding, such that at the end of the Auction the highest bid is automatically accepted and the NFT is transferred to the highest bid's recipient address.\n4. Bids on the auction are made in ETH and should be locked in escrow for the duration of the auction, but automatically returned if a higher bid is made.\n5. If the Auction has not received a bid higher than the reserve price, the original owner can withdraw the NFT. Once a bid has been placed, the NFT is locked until the auction is completed.\n6. Relevant events are emitted for each of the major function calls.\n\n\n### User Story\n\n1. Alice grants permission to transfer the NFT to the auction contract\n2. Calls `createAuction` with the tokenId, reservePrice, and creator address. This transfers the NFT to the contract.\n3. Craig submits a bid below the reserve price, but it reverts\n4. Bob calls `createBid` with a bid that is higher than the reserve price, which sets the currentBid to his address and amount.’ The contract receives Bob's ETH and holds it in escrow.\n5. Craig calls `endAuction`, but it reverts because the current block time doesn't exceed the Auction's end-time\n6. Danny calls `createBid`, which replaces Bob's bid as the current bid. Bob is refunded the ETH that he sent into the contract previously.\n7. No new bids come in, and the current block time exceeds the Auction's end-time\n8. Danny calls `endAuction`, which transfers the NFT to her address.

You can't escape them.\n\nWhile the movement continues to grow, there are open questions around **how to value them**.\n\nMore importantly, **which layers of the stack will capture that value**, and **which players are leading that charge today**.\n\n![Design by Carlos Gomes](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/040b3645-22f4-42a5-a259-ac2b62e523e0.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nTo showcase the power of web3, I'm excited to debut my first NFT - using a Mirror Crowdfund to allow backers to become collective owners of this future article in the form of $VALUE tokens.\n\n[](crowdfund://0xec7b4c86659Fe529C1DBc79df0aaeEAf1c642006?softCap=1&endAt=1613676708)\n\nThis post was incubated in partnership with [Variant](https://variant.fund/) and includes allocations to [MintFund](https://variant.fund/) and [Friends With Benefits](https://fwb.help/).\n\n## What's To Know?\n\n$VALUE tokens represent fractional ownership of my future blog post - **NFT Value Capture**\n\nKey details of $VALUE:\n\n* Contract Address: 0xec7b4c86659Fe529C1DBc79df0aaeEAf1c642006\n* Target: 1 ETH\n* Hard Cap: 2 ETH\n* Max Contribution: 0.25 ETH\n* Exchange Rate: 1 ETH = 1000 VALUE\n\nPledging ETH returns fractional ownership in the form of $VALUE tokens. These tokens can be redeemed for a pro-rata portion of future sales.\n\n13.37% of the ETH raised in this crowdfund will be donated to [MintFund](https://mint.af/) - helping creators launch their first NFT by covering gas and operational costs.\n\nI will retain 25% of VALUE as the author, and will distribute a portion of my tokens to contributors, the Friends with Benefits DAO and other communities of my choosing. \n\n**Backers will share the remaining 75% of $VALUE.**\n\nAll secondary sales will have a 10% creator share. This means every time the zNFT trades on the secondary market, 10% will flow back to contract and can be redeemed by $VALUE holders.\n\n![Breakdown of the crowdfund flow](https://i.imgur.com/rXZgN5M.png)\n\nThe goal of $VALUE is to crowdfund in order to allocate significant time and energy into researching and writing the article, while leaving ample room for the $VALUE zNFT to (hopefully) sell for more on the primary market than what was crowdfunded at inception.\n\n## What To Expect\n\nThis post will be published within a month and serve as a resource for investors, collectors and creators to think about how to allocate capital to the NFT ecosystem, and what I expect to perform best over the next 3-5 years.\n\nIt will be published to the draft attached below, and be updated with the full article at the time of public release.\n\n[NFT Value Capture Equation Draft](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/A16NP2XXi9RdHptfdF9WHR0Xq_E1XDmUgMwPmJYOG7w?2)\n\nWhen it is publicly released, the $VALUE zNFT will be listed on Zora and start accepting bids. I will choose the winning bid (in WETH) 48 hours after its release, and $VALUE owners will be able to redeem tokens for a pro-rata portion of that WETH.\n\n## Why Back This Post?\n\nThis post is the first experiment around my evolving web3 strategy. My strengths lie in storytelling, education and community. I want to use this post to show other writers that written content has value, and that NFTs are a way to capture it.\n\nIf successful, I plan to use this strategy for future releases, with the potential for tokenholders to receive exclusive access to communities I'm a part of like Friends With Benefits.\n\nFor more background on myself, check out [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa) or ask someone about my work. I'm hopeful that their response will speak for itself.\n\nSpecial thanks to Variant for incubating this idea, the Mirror team for the support and all the backers for believing in me and my work.\n\n$VALUE coming SoonTM.", "timestamp": 1615022981, "digest": "b3_zJsOv8vvvJsaOKyCM-KcCeA_zEbn6K1yrmnRSK8Q", "contributor": "0x46301F7E700Be9cFfCE3e5e142a2244Df3f2d4F2"}

Unlike the previous $ESSAY and $VALUE campaigns, the output of this bounty will be _written code_ instead of _written text_.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a29d398d-ed50-4d20-a804-d1c89d3138be.jpeg?height=674&width=1200)\n\n## How it Works\n\n*   The bounty crowdfund has a hard-cap of 7 ETH\n*   Backers can send ETH to the crowdfund in exchange for $BOUNTY tokens\n*   If the funding target is hit, MintFund will hire a talented Solidity developer from the Ethereum community to implement the fully open-source smart contracts\n*   The codebase will be posted on Mirror as permanent, public data and mirrored on GitHub\n*   The codebase will be minted as an NFT on the Zora protocol, representing the first digitally unique and collectible codebase\n*   The final code will be deployed on mainnet and used to auction off this NFT\n*   If the NFT is sold, ETH will accrue to $BOUNTY tokens\n*   $BOUNTY tokens can be traded like any ERC-20 token, or redeemed for underlying ETH\n*   Participants in the crowdfund will be embedded in the code base forever as the supporters who made it possible\n\n25% of **$BOUNTY** tokens will be retained by MintFund and 5% will go to the developer, the remaining 70% will be distributed to **$BOUNTY** backers.\n\n\n## The Power of Reserve Auctions\nSince the advent of NFT transactions, reserve auctions have seen significant traction as a mechanism for selling NFTs. The hype, the intrigue, and the status involved in a singular moment in time where everyone's eyes are fixed upon a particular drop provides a narrative for all the artists who have sold work. Reserve auctions become a tool to connect both artist and collector, a story for communities to rally around—news to be told to the masses. They are a spotlight and turning point of an artist's career in the cryptosphere and we want to bring it to every artist. \nReserve auctions started on SuperRare and have moved to other marketplaces such as Nifty Gateway. However, with a platform like Zora the permissionless nature of the zNFT smart contracts allows anyone to extend the bidding protocol, making it a great fit to add a reserve auction extension. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e5a9ad06-718d-4540-b869-de4fa7d74737.jpeg?height=674&width=1200)\n\n## Why?\nWe believe that building the tools for creatives to push their best works unfettered by cost, access, and exposure yields the next generation of mind bending work and an ever growing community of shared talent, spirit, and wealth. \nMintFund is dedicated to giving all communities, with emphasis to BIPOC & LGBTQIA folks, the means to take cryptomedia / NFTs by storm and move culture along with them. \nWe recognize that the key to achieving our goal of launching life-changing creative careers on the blockchain is threefold: \n1. Cover gas fees to enable access to the tools to participate in the NFT ecosystem\n2. Create tools for artists to increase their exposure and connect with collectors\n3. Build a success-based funding source to ensure MintFund can continue to sustain its work without relying on donations\n\n\n## About the Bounty / Scope of Work\n\n### Requirements\n\n1. Any owner of a Zora NFT should be able to permissionlessly kick off an auction. Kicking off an auction should not require deploying a new contract.\n2. The auction should be configurable such that its constructor accepts (at minimum) two parameters\n    1. Reserve Price (amount + currency address)\n    2. Auction Duration (ex. 24 hours)\n3. The auction should be binding, such that at the end of the Auction the highest bid is automatically accepted and the NFT is transferred to the highest bid's recipient address.\n4. Bids on the auction are made in ETH and should be locked in escrow for the duration of the auction, but automatically returned if a higher bid is made.\n5. If the Auction has not received a bid higher than the reserve price, the original owner can withdraw the NFT. Once a bid has been placed, the NFT is locked until the auction is completed.\n6. Relevant events are emitted for each of the major function calls.\n\n\n### User Story\n\n1. Alice grants permission to transfer the NFT to the auction contract\n2. Calls `createAuction` with the tokenId, reservePrice, and creator address. This transfers the NFT to the contract.\n3. Craig submits a bid below the reserve price, but it reverts\n4. Bob calls `createBid` with a bid that is higher than the reserve price, which sets the currentBid to his address and amount.’ The contract receives Bob's ETH and holds it in escrow.\n5. Craig calls `endAuction`, but it reverts because the current block time doesn't exceed the Auction's end-time\n6. Danny calls `createBid`, which replaces Bob's bid as the current bid. Bob is refunded the ETH that he sent into the contract previously.\n7. No new bids come in, and the current block time exceeds the Auction's end-time\n8. Danny calls `endAuction`, which transfers the NFT to her address. Runs a payout according to the Zora market's BidShare data to send funds to the creator.\n\n\n### High Level Implementation Ideas\n\nEach **_Auction_** is described by the following data:\n*   **tokenId**: The Zora market token ID for the NFT\n*   **duration**: The number seconds that the auction runs for after the first bid, e.g. 24 hours, which is extended with each new bid\n*   **firstBidTime**: Unix timestamp of the first bid\n*   **reservePrice**: Allow the creator to set a reserve price, below which the auction will not settle and the NFT is returned\n*   **creator**: Keep track of the creator in case we need to return the NFT.\nA single auction contract keeps track of multiple auctions, via a simple mapping of **tokenId** to **Auction.** This contract also keeps track of the current **_Bids_** for each **Auction**. Bids are mapped from tokenId to bid. A bid is composed of:\n*   Bidder\n*   Amount\nThe contract has the following functionality:\n- **createAuction**(uint tokenId, uint reservePrice, address creator)\n    - Instantiates an **Auction** using the given parameters, and transfers the NFT to the contract itself, _so that the contract controls the NFT_\n    - **createBid** (uint amount, uint tokenId) external payable\n    - Checks that amount is greater than the current bid, and greater than the reserve price\n    - Check that the msg.value == amount\n    - \"Start the clock\" and increases the duration by \n    - Refund the previous bid\n- **endAuction**(uint tokenId)\n    *   Checks that the current time is greater than the end time\n    *   Transfers the NFT to the highest bidder, if there is one and is greater-or-equal the reserve price, else transfers back to the creator\n- **cancelAuction**(uint tokenId)\n    - Can only be called by the creator\n    - Checks if there are no bids\n    - Transfers the NFT back to the creator\n\n\n## What's Next?\n\nThis initiative, if executed successfully, will not only give new rise to creatives, but create a pipeline to mint their NFTs and expose them to the greater communities that have rallied around MintFund and our growing list of contributors and partners. \n\n## About Mint Fund.\n\nMintFund is a community project created with the sole purpose to build a support network for artists interested in bringing their art into the world of[ NFTs](https://linda.mirror.xyz/df649d61efb92c910464a4e74ae213c4cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d)/[cryptomedia](https://cryptomedia.wtf/).\nMintFund provides artists with the funds to mint NFTs (known as[ gas costs](https://kb.myetherwallet.com/en/transactions/what-is-gas/)), and offers guidance, mentorship and advice for the growing community of cryptomedia artists. MintFund is accessible to all artists and we prioritize BIPOC and LGTBQIA+ artists, especially outside of North America and the European Union.", "timestamp": 1615084090, "digest": "mDws2xGmJCq55ehGDdcv8tGDCpSd_c_CfeqhexiKSqU", "contributor": "0x662d5d79849113A5403Af776210307a7c82a5267"}
