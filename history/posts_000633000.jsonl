Big thanks to [Seth Thompson](https://seththompson.org) at [A Lot of Moving Parts](https://alotofmoving.parts) for creating the token animation.

We call our onboarding model \"burn-to-register\", because members need 1 $WRITE token to join, and the token must be destroyed once they do so. To do this, our $WRITE token's ERC20 contract has a `register` function that burns 1 token before calling into a `registrar` contract that registers the user's ENS name. That `registrar` contract can only be accessed from the $WRITE token, and so these contracts are tightly coupled, and we have needed to take our time to make sure that they were working well and were very gas-efficient. Over the last two weeks, we finalized this system and deployed it to mainnet. Check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/mirror-xyz/write-token/) and the contract on [mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x622236bb180256b6ae1a935dae08dc0356141632#code).\n\nOver the next two weeks, we will migrate existing users to mainnet ENS, and start air-dropping mainnet tokens to new users. We will meticulously observe this process and ideate ways to improve.", "timestamp": 1614109288, "digest": "2g6dBRjn3WhZVqLneKftAJ9r4R8-WxzkeBXvkWbf9zM", "contributor": "0x9651B2a7Aa9ed9635cE896a1Af1a7d6294d5e902"}

In addition to images and videos there is also support for audio and text. Our plan is to progressively introduce greater coverage for metadata, such as display names for creators and owners, along with a few other surprises. You can see the updated NFT embeds in action on [Jesse's entry](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo) and [Cooper's entry](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/PF42Z9oE_r6yhZN9jZrrseXfHaZALj9JIfMplshlgQ0) on NFTs.\n\nBig shoutout to [Sam](https://github.com/sammdec) who authored of the [NFTE](http://nfte.app) component, which we use as the foundation of our NFT embed.", "timestamp": 1614109752, "digest": "wfJMWdyKZxUkdoKOllyV3zSQQ1n1Rzggf-0RBbMsCF0", "contributor": "0x9651B2a7Aa9ed9635cE896a1Af1a7d6294d5e902"}
