For this reason, the Brazilian artist creates unruly images and sounds in a place of disobedience and makes their works a counter-hegemonic fissure, liberating themself in subjectivities.\n\nFind them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/occult3d), [Foundation](https://foundation.app/@occulted) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/occulted/).\n\n***\n\n## About MintFund\n\nMintFund is a community project created with the sole purpose to build a support network for artists interested in bringing their art into the world of NFTs/cryptomedia.

We cultivate identity, consciously or subconsciously, to make us feel good about ourselves, to give us status. \n\nToday, with 75% of young people spending almost all of their time online, a portion of our identity construction has moved to the social web, resulting in modern-era digital identities that are independent of nation states.\n\nSimilarly to how state-issued identities allowed citizens to work and live in urban environments, corporation-issued web identities have allowed users to log in and use online services - such as media streaming via YouTube, or mobile payments via Venmo.\n\nBut the centralization inherent in the storage and control of these identities presents numerous challenges, including exponential security risks, and an artificial and reductive social identity.\n\nIn a separate vein of the internet, decentralization of value in the form of blockchain-based digital assets - including stablecoins, community tokens, and NFT artworks - have exploded in popularity. \n\nThe blockchain technology underlying this movement has mainly been used for public financial accounting of these assets; as peer-to-peer \"ledgers\" that enable financial transactions without an intermediary. Its primary strengths are censorship resistance and guaranteed execution.\n\nBut a public ledger also implies an accessible, auditable, temporally ordered record of interactions among users - such as purchasing art, or lending currency.

I also avoid specific implementations for on-chain identity. Both of these topics are well covered elsewhere. \n\nFinally, I am not a proponent of \"identity protocols\", but, as this post suggests, I view identity as an emergent property of interconnected crypto networks and the activity on them.\n\n## **Intersectional Identity**\n\nThe concept that individuality is the intersection of a person's group affiliations and interests has a rich history - [dating to the beginnings of social science](https://research.bangor.ac.uk/portal/files/13878843/2016_Intersectional_individuality.pdf), when it was formulated by German-Jewish philosopher and psychologist, Moritz Lazarus, and carried on by intellectual heirs such as Georg Simmel and Charles Cooley.\n\nThese early writers argued that modernity was characterized by a more diversified life; that the mind of a person has greater variety of interests, affiliation, and personal projects than ever before. They imagine these affiliations and interests as a system of coordinates, with each additional group determining individuality more exactly.\n\n> \"A man may be regarded as the point of intersection of an indefinite number of circles representing social groups\"\n- Cooley, Human Nature and the Social Order (1922)\n\nCooley specifically [anticipated](https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Cooley/Cooley_1902/Cooley_1902e.html) that expanding individuality is connected with the \"growth of communication\". The blossoming of global communication networks on the internet has borne this out and given interested researchers in every field of study new tools for understanding what it is to be a social animal in a modern world:\n\n> ...beyond the fact that it is so immediately important in all of our lives, [the science of networks] cuts across fields: making sense of human networks draws on core concepts and studies from sociology, economics, math, physics, computer science, and anthropology.\n\n- Jackson, Matthew O.. The Human Network (p. 10). Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.\n\nIntersectional identity is a robust way to operationalize and understand identity, and the proliferation of digital networks has accelerated multidisciplinary research on this topic. As we will see, crypto networks deepens this field immensely, and opens it to more accessible and accurate study.\n\n### Problems with this View\n\nFor most of us, the freedom to create intersectional individuality has been achieved through progressive social movements. For example, first and second wave feminism in the United States expanded women's interests and affiliations through ownership of property, and integration with political and workplace groups. Other examples would include the Black Consciousness Movement in South Africa, and the Gay Rights Movement globally.\n\nLooking through an optimistic lens, modernity is a progressive march towards inclusion, which implies more group affiliation - a broader social life - and hence more individuality. Glen Weyl and Zoë Hitzig (2018) [give a colorful example](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3306738) of this, in what they consider to be a fully self-actualized individual in a liberal society:\n\n> One [example] is the gay nephew of the former ultra-orthodox chief rabbi of State of Israel. He is deeply steeped in nearly ever Jewish theological tradition and is ordained as a conservative rabbi, but runs a “God-optional” shul and was thrown out of the conservative rabbinate for marrying a Jew to a non-Jew. He knows and incorporates into his sermons more social theory and sociology than most rabbis, yet his shul is driven primarily by the contributions of a wide range of artists who draw on ancient Jewish traditions from all over the world.\n\nBut when considered holistically, the increasing multiplicity of our identities has benefited those belonging to some affiliations while, on a relative basis, been exponentially detrimental to others.\n\nThe [dominant use of the term \"intersectionality\"](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142) in social science today (starting with [Crenshaw, 1992](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1229039)), has built a framework for understanding of how oppression, derived from the combination of our social identities, is not merely additive, but at the least multiplicative:\n\n> How one form of oppression is experienced is influenced by and influences how another form is experienced. An additive analysis treats the oppression of a Black woman in a society that is racist as well as sexist as if it were a further burden when, in fact, it is a different burden ... sexism and racism must be seen as interlocking, and not as piled upon each other \n- [Spelman 1988](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/204131/inessential-woman-by-elizabeth-v-spelman/)\n\n> The term intersectionality references the critical insight that race, class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, nation, ability, and age operate not as unitary, mutually exclusive entities, but as reciprocally constructing phenomena that in turn shape complex social inequalities.\n- [Collins, 2015](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142)\n\nThese \"reciprocally constructing phenomena\" that may empower one person with increasing self-actualization, burden others with exponentially debilitating oppression. The fact that this extends to digital life can be deduced *a priori*, but examples are easy to generate: women are *more* targeted online than in real life, because of reduced friction to do so. Hate-speech is easier to propagate due to the algorithmically-amplified virality of content from polarized online groups.\n\nWhile we don't have long-term evidence for the efficacy of crypto networks as a tool for social liberation yet, crypto networks are unique in that they promise participants a highly functional \"persistent pseudonymity\" that has protective functions. An account on these networks do not necessarily reveal a person's nominal offline identity, but also allows its holder to participate in economic activity and exhibit individuality (e.g. group affiliation and taste), while hiding any unbidden or personal attributes likely to lead to oppression (e.g. nationality, race, gender, sex, etc).\n\n## NFTs as Cultural Objects with Socio-Economic Networks\n\n> Minting a token is an enactment of authenticity, an ontological shift in the history of representation.\n\n- A line from [A Feminist Manifesta of the Blockchain](https://hyperallergic.com/639180/a-feminist-manifesta-of-the-blockchain/) by Claudia Hart\n\nNew technologies allow artists to create objects that produce new meanings, social relations, and reputations within a field. Minting an NFT simultaneously creates art and its historical record.\n\n### Technology and Economic Networks in the Construction of Identity\n\nIn *Beethoven and the Construction of Genius,* Tia Nora explains how the invention of the pianoforte was a determinant of Beethoven's success in his early days as a composer; the new sounds evoking a greater range of emotional responses in listeners. But DeNora also examined the social and economic networks that supported Beethoven in Vienna, providing insight into the origins of his identity as the genius we regard him to be today:\n\n> [DeNora] examines more closely than anyone else just which aristocrats supported Beethoven, where they were in the complex Austrian hierarchy, why they backed him, and how this affected aesthetic perceptions. Her study provides substantial insight into the interworking between musical creation and production and the social forces that shape them... \n- [Broyles (1995)](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/161449671.pdf)\n\nNFTs are a technology that allow artists, patrons, and collectors to express and secure ownership of digital goods on a public ledger, and in doing so reveals preferences among and within socio-economic networks. This grants us an unprecedented view into the cultural norms of digital communities. For example, [Charlotte Kent (2021)](https://hyperallergic.com/652667/how-women-artists-have-been-marginalized-in-the-blockchain-discourse/) implicitly alludes to *generalized social exchange* occurring within communities of NFT artists:\n\n> “One notable feature of artists using blockchain is their interest in buying art with the funds they receive...This community-oriented attitude is reminiscent of early feminist practices”\n\nNFTs are cultural objects that not only bring new meaning, social relations and reputation online, but also allow us to express value for community-oriented attitudes and collective narratives. An excellent example of is the sale of the NFT “Dreaming at Dusk” (2021), for 500 ETH (~two million dollars at the time of auction, May 14). The NFT supports the Tor Project, which describes its mission as:\n\n> To advance human rights and freedoms by creating and deploying free and open source anonymity and privacy technologies, supporting their unrestricted availability and use, and furthering their scientific and popular understanding.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/35855)\n\nDreaming at Dusk was collected by a on-chain organization called PleasrDAO. We therefore have a metric that hypothetically assigns a cultural attitude to the PleasrDAO community - according to those values inherent in the Tor Project: human rights through open-source privacy technology. This would extend for any account that bid on the audition for this work, all publicly viewable on-chain. \n\nThe preference for art, expressed through bidding and collecting NFTs, can be a map for digital identity - for a community as well as an individual.\n\n### DAOs as Token-Driven Culture\n\nCulture can measured by embedded \"collective narratives\", expressed in a shared language (*schemas*) and knitted together in a consistent manner. These can produce moral norms (beliefs, attitudes, and values) that inform behavior. \n\n> People construct social reality via the development, transmission, and institutionalization of shared patterns of thinking across generations.\n\n- Measuring Culture (2020), p. 23\n\nShorn, Lotti & Hart (2019) articulate how blockchains enable the organic development of organizations that form shared consensus - conceived as a \"headless brand*\"*, in their iconic article, [Headless Brands](https://otherinter.net/web3/headless-brands/):\n\n> While brands have traditionally been planned and designed directly by corporations, the rise of networked media has challenged the coherence of centrally-managed brand identities. New blockchain-based decentralized organizations take this a step further by giving users financial incentive to spread brand narratives of their own...In this way, a brand operates as a consensus system, facilitating a consistent set of beliefs across people.\n\nBeyond brands, social communities in general are beginning to proliferate around tokens. Friends with Benefits is one such example, whereby the access to the community and its productive capacity is gated by ownership of the token, and holders of the token are financially incentivized to increase its value. Members are interdependent within the community, and work to make it better without any formal organizational hierarchy - bound only by their values:\n\n> Friends with Benefits started as a private Discord server populated by our favorite thinkers and has since evolved into a global community bound together by shared values, shared incentives ($FWB) and shared IRL + URL experiences\n\n- [Evolution of the FWB DAO](https://zhang.mirror.xyz/9sRa2kNDUpkWoQkWw67bJ8PczFyTSX8fotf7JOddxew) - Alex Zhang (2021)\n\nBlockchains allow for people to play new kinds of coordination games, empowered by shared narratives and enacted by a decentralized organization of users. The classic example of a DAO is Bitcoin, which incentivizes millions of people to add labor to the project (in the form of marketing, research, or software development), without formally employing a single person. Although DAOs might have a core development team, or individuals who can influence the DAO's participants, there is no executive board with special powers.\n\nAs the number of people \"working for\" these DAOs expands, it takes on grander proportions, as articulated in [DAOs, Democracy and Governance](http://merkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf), 2016, by Ralph C. Merkle:\n\n> Modern research into “the wisdom of crowds” provides new insights into how to combine the expertise of all participants without handing over control to “experts”. Combined with research on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), this allows us to design a new form of democracy which is more stable, less prone to erratic behavior, better able to meet the needs of its citizens, and which better uses the expertise of all its citizens to make high-quality decisions. We call this new form of democracy a DAO Democracy.\n\nTaken to its most grand proportion, is Balaji's idea of starting a \"Crypto Civilization\":\n\n[https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1269178671086006273?s=20](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1269178671086006273?s=20)\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis post begins to explain how individual identity, viewed as the intersection of our social affiliations and tastes, is an emergent property of blockchain interactions. The richness of our on-chain identities increases as more people and content move onto these networks.\n\nWhile state-issued *formal identities* (e.g. SSN number) and corporation-issued informal identities (e.g. a Facebook login) entail severe security risks through centralization and a high decree of artificiality, decentralized identities promise persistent pseudonymity, while enabling economic cooperation and a greater expression of individuality through the collection of digital cultural objects and participation in DAOs. \n\nThis is a field in its infancy, but it clear that there is potential for crossover among the fields of computer science, network analysis, economic sociology, and many others, in the understanding of our on-chain identities.\n\nIf the use of blockchains continue to proliferate as they have so far, this may become one of the most meaningful fields of study in human history.", "timestamp": 1623792412, "digest": "17-QuzdJJ0n-WGtuFiSXpH13-F3XCBgiPYCRtKANwc8", "contributor": "0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026"}

For example, [Charlotte Kent (2021)](https://hyperallergic.com/652667/how-women-artists-have-been-marginalized-in-the-blockchain-discourse/) implicitly alludes to *generalized social exchange* occurring within communities of NFT artists:\n\n> “One notable feature of artists using blockchain is their interest in buying art with the funds they receive...This community-oriented attitude is reminiscent of early feminist practices”\n\nNFTs are cultural objects that not only bring new meaning, social relations and reputation online, but also allow us to express value for community-oriented attitudes and collective narratives. An excellent example of is the sale of the NFT “Dreaming at Dusk” (2021), for 500 ETH (~two million dollars at the time of auction, May 14). The NFT supports the Tor Project, which describes its mission as:\n\n> To advance human rights and freedoms by creating and deploying free and open source anonymity and privacy technologies, supporting their unrestricted availability and use, and furthering their scientific and popular understanding.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/35855)\n\nDreaming at Dusk was collected by a on-chain organization called PleasrDAO. We therefore have a metric that hypothetically assigns a cultural attitude to the PleasrDAO community - according to those values inherent in the Tor Project: human rights through open-source privacy technology. This would extend for any account that bid on the audition for this work, all publicly viewable on-chain. \n\nThe preference for art, expressed through bidding and collecting NFTs, can be a map for digital identity - for a community as well as an individual.\n\n### DAOs as Token-Driven Culture\n\nCulture can measured by embedded \"collective narratives\", expressed in a shared language (*schemas*) and knitted together in a consistent manner. These can produce moral norms (beliefs, attitudes, and values) that inform behavior. \n\n> People construct social reality via the development, transmission, and institutionalization of shared patterns of thinking across generations.\n\n- Measuring Culture (2020), p. 23\n\nShorn, Lotti & Hart (2019) articulate how blockchains enable the organic development of organizations that form shared consensus - conceived as a \"headless brand*\"*, in their iconic article, [Headless Brands](https://otherinter.net/web3/headless-brands/):\n\n> While brands have traditionally been planned and designed directly by corporations, the rise of networked media has challenged the coherence of centrally-managed brand identities. New blockchain-based decentralized organizations take this a step further by giving users financial incentive to spread brand narratives of their own...In this way, a brand operates as a consensus system, facilitating a consistent set of beliefs across people.\n\nBeyond brands, social communities in general are beginning to proliferate around tokens. Friends with Benefits is one such example, whereby the access to the community and its productive capacity is gated by ownership of the token, and holders of the token are financially incentivized to increase its value. Members are interdependent within the community, and work to make it better without any formal organizational hierarchy - bound only by their values:\n\n> Friends with Benefits started as a private Discord server populated by our favorite thinkers and has since evolved into a global community bound together by shared values, shared incentives ($FWB) and shared IRL + URL experiences\n\n- [Evolution of the FWB DAO](https://zhang.mirror.xyz/9sRa2kNDUpkWoQkWw67bJ8PczFyTSX8fotf7JOddxew) - Alex Zhang (2021)\n\nBlockchains allow for people to play new kinds of coordination games, empowered by shared narratives and enacted by a decentralized organization of users. The classic example of a DAO is Bitcoin, which incentivizes millions of people to add labor to the project (in the form of marketing, research, or software development), without formally employing a single person. Although DAOs might have a core development team, or individuals who can influence the DAO's participants, there is no executive board with special powers.\n\nAs the number of people \"working for\" these DAOs expands, it takes on grander proportions, as articulated in [DAOs, Democracy and Governance](http://merkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf), 2016, by Ralph C. Merkle:\n\n> Modern research into “the wisdom of crowds” provides new insights into how to combine the expertise of all participants without handing over control to “experts”. Combined with research on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), this allows us to design a new form of democracy which is more stable, less prone to erratic behavior, better able to meet the needs of its citizens, and which better uses the expertise of all its citizens to make high-quality decisions. We call this new form of democracy a DAO Democracy.\n\nTaken to its most grand proportion, is Balaji's idea of starting a \"Crypto Civilization\":\n\n[https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1269178671086006273?s=20](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1269178671086006273?s=20)\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis post begins to explain how individual identity, viewed as the intersection of our social affiliations and tastes, is an emergent property of blockchain interactions. The richness of our on-chain identities increases as more people and content move onto these networks.\n\nWhile state-issued *formal identities* (e.g. SSN number) and corporation-issued informal identities (e.g. a Facebook login) entail severe security risks through centralization and a high decree of artificiality, decentralized identities promise persistent pseudonymity, while enabling economic cooperation and a greater expression of individuality through the collection of digital cultural objects and participation in DAOs. \n\nThis is a field in its infancy, but it clear that there is potential for crossover among the fields of computer science, network analysis, economic sociology, and many others, in the understanding of our on-chain identities.\n\nIf the use of blockchains continue to proliferate as they have so far, this may become one of the most meaningful fields of study in human history.", "timestamp": 1623792689, "digest": "17-QuzdJJ0n-WGtuFiSXpH13-F3XCBgiPYCRtKANwc8", "contributor": "0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026"}

The space has you covered for anything ranging from [peer-to-protocol lending protocols](https://aave.com/) to [insurance policies that protect users from loss of funds due to protocol bugs](https://nexusmutual.io/). Derivative protocols like [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) have you covered for any investments in non ETH-based assets, and you need look no further than [Opyn](https://www.opyn.co/) for all your cash-settled options trading needs. \n\nThe space is quickly starting to resemble a fully functional financial system, with all the applications and systems needed for standard retail investor transactions established and regularly audited, but also the most niche structured products thriving and innovating further with every passing day. \n\nHowever, the most striking difference is that DeFi is trying to do what TradFi (Traditional Finance) did over the past 2,000 years in just a couple of years. This is in large part due to the power of true and native [composability](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-true-power-of-defi-composability-14fe8355e0d0#:~:text=Composability%2C%20in%20DeFi%2C%20is%20the,and%20therefore%20each%20other's%20utility.).

We are still a while away from widespread adoption of DeFi, and as many people often say, \"we are still early\". [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), the most popular chrome extension based wallet used to interact with DeFi, only recently reached 5 million monthly active users. Mainstream adoption too soon would potentially come at the wrong time for DeFi because many of the applications would not be ready to properly support the extreme volume, but I have had a lot of time to think about this problem lately and have come to some conclusions about what I think needs to happen in the space before it is fully ready.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/76a440fa-1ae5-443a-97fd-356ebd1a0f25.png?height=848&width=2152)\n\nI call these factors **the Three \"U\"s of DeFi Ubiquity**.\n\n#### Usability\n\nThe first, and arguably most important of these hurdles to ubiquity, is usability. Many of the most successful DeFi protocols are advanced, regularly audited and professionally run but have user interfaces that are unapproachable to all but the most sophisticated investors. In reality, the service they are offering is an enabler for the democratisation of many financial instruments previously unavailable to most investors. \n\nThe key to this issue is going to be knowing which parts of the UI to hide, and which to display prominently. [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) is one of the market leaders in keeping its UI simple yet powerful. Still, there will eventually be a divergence of the consumer level interfaces and pro-level interfaces using the same backend, a bit like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) vs [Coinbase **Pro**](https://pro.coinbase.com) to really drive this point home. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) does not focus greatly on UI refinement at the moment, but it will take a beginner-friendly browser wallet that has a good fiat on-ramp and perhaps doesn't even refer to itself as a wallet but more as a [key to Web3](https://rainbow.me) to really help push DApps into the mainstream.\n\nIncreasingly we will start to see startups cropping up worldwide in various industries focusing on leveraging DeFi technologies to verticalise and fine-tune the experience for different audiences with different financial preferences. The technology behind many of the most popular DeFi protocols is fine-tuned and optimised for scale, performance and reliability, so there is a wide-open opportunity for startups to come into specific geographies such as developing economies, where debt financing for small businesses is harder to come by, and build a straightforward front end. This front end could then automatically tap into the sea of open-source protocols and liquidity that is readily available. It could then focus on making it accessible to non-crypto-native audiences with seamless on-ramps for Fiat which, in the future, could allow someone in Venezuela to take out a loan using stablecoins on [AAVE](http://aave.com/) using an [L2 solution like Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) without ever noticing that they have done all of this on a trustless and decentralised back end. \n\nIdeally, customers would eventually be aware of the fact that they are interacting with DeFi, but in order to reach a truly mainstream audience there will be a transitionary period where perhaps these front ends do not lean too heavily into the crypto angle. This movement comes straight out of the playbook of new Fintech startups like [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) and [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/) that have spent the past decade taking complex financial systems, reducing their complexity and making them accessible to retail investors. These startups often build on top of TradFi and reduce friction for retail users by bending the rules or by [bundling transactions together](https://www.freetrade.io). DeFi could use the same approach and reduce friction even further. It is unlikely that this simplified DeFi front end innovation will come from the existing Fintech incumbents because the way they are used to working is so different to the way DeFi works. TradFi Fintech startups are used to pushing up against and fighting the traditional systems to try and squeeze them into a user experience that is pleasant to use. The DeFi space is flexible by design so the approach taken by these verticalised DeFi gateways will be simple, and even encouraged by the protocols themselves, contrary to the struggles faced by TradFi Fintech startups. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/619cb9ed-b108-46e9-af75-3b211568bb06.png?height=806&width=1825)\n\nWhile there will be many independent startups fulfilling this function and maybe even getting funded through the protocols' own grants DAOs, many of these usability improvements will also come from the protocols' own core teams, especially on the institutional side. TradFi tends to prefer interacting directly with the people that built the technology they are going to be leveraging. [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) has actually started experimenting with [permissioned pools for institutional investors](https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-lending-platform-aave-reveals-private-pool-for-institutions) because institutional investors previously found it tough to use the protocol due to lack of [KYC and AML](https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/kyc-aml-know-your-customer-vs-anti-money-laundering/) compliance, and this has allowed banks and other institutional clients using [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) to know that the other parties in the network are compliant and vetted not to be on an [OFAC sanctions list](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information). This is just another example of DeFi slightly adapting to TradFi without compromising on their core principles as an almost intermediate stage to mainstream adoption. Whether that be through making it feel like Fiat through stable-coins, or increasing KYC for institutions to help them to feel more at ease about the protocols they are transacting with, these measures all go a long way towards lowering hurdles to mass adoption.\n\nThe runway is wide open, and the tech is ready. These protocols exist and are being built and tested by thousands of users every day. The best part is that anyone can come in and make them more useful to any specific demographic. Look no further than projects like [Ribbon](https://www.ribbon.finance) to see this in action. [Ribbon](htts://www.ribbon.finance) has made some sophisticated covered call strategies available to anyone with a [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io/) by building directly on [Opyn's](https://www.opyn.co/) cash-settled ETH options protocol, all while making it feel as simple as an, admittedly high-risk, savings account to the end-user.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0ec888-d3db-4856-af1d-48280478715d.png?height=851&width=2325)\n\n#### Undercolateralisation \n\nThe second hurdle is the issue of overcolateralisation in DeFi lending protocols. When you put the whole DeFi stack together, what you are left with is essentially a fully decentralised crypto bank that runs itself in the most traditional sense of the word. DeFi, just like a bank, allows you to convert between currencies, deposit money and receive interest in return for providing liquidity to the bank to then allow them to loan it back out. On the other side of the equation, anyone can then go to the bank, take out a loan and then pay it back at a rate most suited to their risk profile and time horizon. In TradFi some loans are unsecured, but many are secured in that they have some form of collateral backing the loan. If you fail to pay back said loan, the traditional bank has the legal authority to repossess that asset and liquidate it in exchange for cash. The percentage of the total loan required as collateral often depends on a credit score and past successful repayment of loans. Some traditional bank loans are overcollateralised when the asset is highly illiquid to make sure that enough cash can be recouped in the event of a loan default. Conversely in most DeFi lending protocols, you need to provide significantly more crypto as collateral than the stable-coins you are borrowing, sometimes as much as 700%.\n\nIt can be hard to understand why someone would ever want to take out a loan worth less than the amount they are putting down as collateral, and whilst there are some valid reasons for this such as delaying a taxable event or increasing leverage on positions through complex financial gymnastics, the vast majority of the world is unwilling or more importantly unable to borrow money in this way. The main reason people borrow money is precisely that they do not have the spare capital available at that time. People take out mortgages to buy houses, or take out loans to start a small restaurant in their hometown. Sometimes your mortgage may even start highly collateralised but later turns undercollateralised if the value of the house goes down, and due to the credit history of the borrower, the loan is still able to remain a _performing loan_. However, the downside of undercollateralisation is that if the loan were to default, the collateral would not be able to cover the principal. In this case, the borrower would step in to cover the difference if they are in fact creditworthy and have some reputational skin in the game. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/17b662fe-a9af-4b5c-afda-aeb07b88e131.png?height=845&width=2138)\n\nTo cater properly to these kinds of users it is important that DeFi eventually gets to a point where loans can be undercollateralised in some way. The difficulty is that DeFi is by its very nature anonymous and trustless, which means that the concept of social proof and credit scores becomes very difficult to handle. A potential solution could be a quasi-anonymous loan passport solution in which the user is anonymous on one dimension but not on another, i.e. their wallet address is public, but the owner of the wallet is not. One could, in theory, understand someone's creditworthiness through their past loans/wallet history, which is of course publicly visible on Web3 or even decrease the user's collateral requirement for their next loan by a certain percentage every time they repay successfully. Another alternative is allowing user loans to be backed/secured by other individuals they know in real life that trust the borrower enough to guarantee their loan and [delegate their credit](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/credit-delegation). Perhaps we could even see some CeFi institutions step in to perform credit checks on DeFi users on a per address basis. This solution would, of course, introduce some centralisation as it would involve real-identity based KYC, but may be a necessary interim solution for users that prioritise a low collateral ratio over absolute anonymity as lending protocols like AAVE could eventually introduce pools of loans where a trusted third party has verified creditworthiness in advance. \n\nThere are already some great projects being built in this space like [teller.finance](https://www.teller.finance/) which is taking a similar approach by connecting to your bank account through [Plaid](https://plaid.com/). Although we are still a while away from a foolproof creditworthiness checker solution in DeFi there are many different approaches one can take and I believe a combination of these approaches will play a large part in solving the issue of collateralisation in the quest for widespread adoption.\n\n#### Understability\n\nThe final hurdle that, depending on how you look at things could be the hardest or easiest of these to solve, is the difficulty around understandability and education. This hurdle may ultimately solve itself if the first two issues are solved and DeFi starts to resemble the way in which users are used to dealing with and thinking about finances. However, it is still important to acknowledge that for non-technical people, the DeFi space can be very opaque and consequently more difficult to trust.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/46fc773f-114b-42c0-b1db-eade3492e306.png?height=697&width=2015)\n\nFiat money and the way centralised traditional financial systems work is deeply ingrained in our culture and is a little easier to properly comprehend because many parts of the system rely on trust and simple written agreements which come together to form financial systems. Understanding the way these systems work in DeFi is a lot less straightforward. While in TradFi it is relatively straightforward to explain the basics of how a bank works, in that one can deposit money, and in return the bank lends that money out and pays interest for that privilege. There are very few parts of that process that are opaque because, ultimately, it just involves numbers moving from one spreadsheet to another.\n\nThe difference with DeFi is that you first have to feel comfortable with the concept of decentralisation, anonymity, trustless systems, distributed ledgers, and then you have to try and explain how all of this functions automatically through smart-contracts. There are many parts of DeFi that have to be hand-waved away and perhaps this could become a hindrance to trust. \n\nOne could also, of course, argue that many people implicitly trust the banking system because enough other trusted people do and not because they understand every part of the process. The same could eventually be true when enough knowledgeable people trust DeFi and understand a good enough percentage of the current information gaps. \n\nThere are some great resources out there like [Finematics](https://finematics.com/) and [Bankless](https://banklesshq.com/) doing amazing things in the education space and teaching newcomers about all things DeFi. I think this will be crucial in making sure people are comfortable enough with the technology to use it, especially when currently decentralisation slightly goes against the grain and users may be met with scepticism from friends and family. \n\n\n\nOverall the space is going in all the right directions. It will take a while for these ideas to materialise fully, but this is the part that interests me the most about the DeFi space. There is so much mind-blowing R&D going on every day, and people are experimenting, taking risks and breaking boundaries. Therefore, I'm very passionate about making sure as many people as possible have access to these tools and can take part in the revolution. Understanding the pieces of the puzzle left to fill will become more and more important as more protocols are built out and refined.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this piece 😊 It's a topic that has been on my mind for the past couple of months and I really enjoyed laying out and structuring my thoughts on the matter. \n\nIf you enjoyed the piece and are interested in receiving more of my content or keeping up to date with anything else I get up to a follow on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/coconidodev) would be great... or if you're more of an email person that works too - subscribe to my infrequent mailing newsletter via the link below.", "timestamp": 1623795369, "digest": "klQF-dVD9TOVI288YuTObvBVY5_GsrmBGDunRoWpYt8", "contributor": "0xcde3725B25D6d9bC78CF0941cC15Fd9710c764b9"}

DeFi, just like a bank, allows you to convert between currencies, deposit money and receive interest in return for providing liquidity to the bank to then allow them to loan it back out. On the other side of the equation, anyone can then go to the bank, take out a loan and then pay it back at a rate most suited to their risk profile and time horizon. In TradFi some loans are unsecured, but many are secured in that they have some form of collateral backing the loan. If you fail to pay back said loan, the traditional bank has the legal authority to repossess that asset and liquidate it in exchange for cash. The percentage of the total loan required as collateral often depends on a credit score and past successful repayment of loans. Some traditional bank loans are overcollateralised when the asset is highly illiquid to make sure that enough cash can be recouped in the event of a loan default. Conversely in most DeFi lending protocols, you need to provide significantly more crypto as collateral than the stable-coins you are borrowing, sometimes as much as 700%.\n\nIt can be hard to understand why someone would ever want to take out a loan worth less than the amount they are putting down as collateral, and whilst there are some valid reasons for this such as delaying a taxable event or increasing leverage on positions through complex financial gymnastics, the vast majority of the world is unwilling or more importantly unable to borrow money in this way. The main reason people borrow money is precisely that they do not have the spare capital available at that time. People take out mortgages to buy houses, or take out loans to start a small restaurant in their hometown. Sometimes your mortgage may even start highly collateralised but later turns undercollateralised if the value of the house goes down, and due to the credit history of the borrower, the loan is still able to remain a _performing loan_. However, the downside of undercollateralisation is that if the loan were to default, the collateral would not be able to cover the principal. In this case, the borrower would step in to cover the difference if they are in fact creditworthy and have some reputational skin in the game. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/17b662fe-a9af-4b5c-afda-aeb07b88e131.png?height=845&width=2138)\n\nTo cater properly to these kinds of users it is important that DeFi eventually gets to a point where loans can be undercollateralised in some way. The difficulty is that DeFi is by its very nature anonymous and trustless, which means that the concept of social proof and credit scores becomes very difficult to handle. A potential solution could be a quasi-anonymous loan passport solution in which the user is anonymous on one dimension but not on another, i.e. their wallet address is public, but the owner of the wallet is not. One could, in theory, understand someone's creditworthiness through their past loans/wallet history, which is of course publicly visible on Web3 or even decrease the user's collateral requirement for their next loan by a certain percentage every time they repay successfully. Another alternative is allowing user loans to be backed/secured by other individuals they know in real life that trust the borrower enough to guarantee their loan and [delegate their credit](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/credit-delegation). Perhaps we could even see some CeFi institutions step in to perform credit checks on DeFi users on a per address basis. This solution would, of course, introduce some centralisation as it would involve real-identity based KYC, but may be a necessary interim solution for users that prioritise a low collateral ratio over absolute anonymity as lending protocols like AAVE could eventually introduce pools of loans where a trusted third party has verified creditworthiness in advance. \n\nThere are already some great projects being built in this space like [teller.finance](https://www.teller.finance/) which is taking a similar approach by connecting to your bank account through [Plaid](https://plaid.com/). Although we are still a while away from a foolproof creditworthiness checker solution in DeFi there are many different approaches one can take and I believe a combination of these approaches will play a large part in solving the issue of collateralisation in the quest for widespread adoption.\n\n#### Understability\n\nThe final hurdle that, depending on how you look at things could be the hardest or easiest of these to solve, is the difficulty around understandability and education. This hurdle may ultimately solve itself if the first two issues are solved and DeFi starts to resemble the way in which users are used to dealing with and thinking about finances. However, it is still important to acknowledge that for non-technical people, the DeFi space can be very opaque and consequently more difficult to trust.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/46fc773f-114b-42c0-b1db-eade3492e306.png?height=697&width=2015)\n\nFiat money and the way centralised traditional financial systems work is deeply ingrained in our culture and is a little easier to properly comprehend because many parts of the system rely on trust and simple written agreements which come together to form financial systems. Understanding the way these systems work in DeFi is a lot less straightforward. While in TradFi it is relatively straightforward to explain the basics of how a bank works, in that one can deposit money, and in return the bank lends that money out and pays interest for that privilege. There are very few parts of that process that are opaque because, ultimately, it just involves numbers moving from one spreadsheet to another.\n\nThe difference with DeFi is that you first have to feel comfortable with the concept of decentralisation, anonymity, trustless systems, distributed ledgers, and then you have to try and explain how all of this functions automatically through smart-contracts. There are many parts of DeFi that have to be hand-waved away and perhaps this could become a hindrance to trust. \n\nOne could also, of course, argue that many people implicitly trust the banking system because enough other trusted people do and not because they understand every part of the process. The same could eventually be true when enough knowledgeable people trust DeFi and understand a good enough percentage of the current information gaps. \n\nThere are some great resources out there like [Finematics](https://finematics.com/) and [Bankless](https://banklesshq.com/) doing amazing things in the education space and teaching newcomers about all things DeFi. I think this will be crucial in making sure people are comfortable enough with the technology to use it, especially when currently decentralisation slightly goes against the grain and users may be met with scepticism from friends and family. \n\n\n\nOverall the space is going in all the right directions. It will take a while for these ideas to materialise fully, but this is the part that interests me the most about the DeFi space. There is so much mind-blowing R&D going on every day, and people are experimenting, taking risks and breaking boundaries. Therefore, I'm very passionate about making sure as many people as possible have access to these tools and can take part in the revolution. Understanding the pieces of the puzzle left to fill will become more and more important as more protocols are built out and refined.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this piece 😊 It's a topic that has been on my mind for the past couple of months and I really enjoyed laying out and structuring my thoughts on the matter. \n\nIf you enjoyed the piece and are interested in receiving more of my content or keeping up to date with anything else I get up to a follow on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/coconidodev) would be great... or if you're more of an email person that works too - subscribe to my infrequent mailing newsletter via the link below.", "timestamp": 1623796201, "digest": "klQF-dVD9TOVI288YuTObvBVY5_GsrmBGDunRoWpYt8", "contributor": "0xcde3725B25D6d9bC78CF0941cC15Fd9710c764b9"}

We cultivate identity, consciously or subconsciously, to make us feel good about ourselves, to give us status. \n\nToday, with 75% of young people spending almost all of their time online, a portion of our identity construction has moved to the social web, resulting in modern-era digital identities that are independent of nation states.\n\nSimilarly to how state-issued identities allowed citizens to work and live in urban environments, corporation-issued web identities have allowed users to log in and use online services - such as media streaming via YouTube, or mobile payments via Venmo.\n\nBut the centralization inherent in the storage and control of these identities presents numerous challenges, including exponential security risks, and an artificial and reductive social identity.\n\nIn a separate vein of the internet, decentralization of value in the form of blockchain-based digital assets - including stablecoins, community tokens, and NFT artworks - have exploded in popularity. \n\nThe blockchain technology underlying this movement has mainly been used for public financial accounting of these assets; as peer-to-peer \"ledgers\" that enable financial transactions without an intermediary. Its primary strengths are censorship resistance and guaranteed execution.\n\nBut a public ledger also implies an accessible, auditable, temporally ordered record of interactions among users - such as purchasing art, or lending currency. Analysis of the contents of these ledgers invites narrative generation with regards to its account holders, which births a new crypto-economic sociology. Identity, understood as *what is known* about us by others, can therefore be represented by information stored on blockchains. \n\nI hold that the major disciplines that study identity guide us towards a conception of individuality that is represented well by blockchains, and that blockchains are the best tool that we have for expanding, formalizing, and protecting our identities in a socially progressive way.\n\nI explain how on-chain \"intersectional identity\" can be constructed from token ownership networks that reveal group affiliation, and *taste* - viewing NFTs as cultural objects with shared significance.\n\nI leave out the fact that many systemic problems observed in social media, including [political polarization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bu5l9HREZE), security threats, and other malicious personal attacks, may be mitigated by the increased use of pseudonymous digital identities. I also avoid specific implementations for on-chain identity. Both of these topics are well covered elsewhere. \n\nFinally, I am not a proponent of \"identity protocols\", but, as this post suggests, I view identity as an emergent property of interconnected crypto networks and the activity on them.\n\n## **Intersectional Identity**\n\nThe concept that individuality is the intersection of a person's group affiliations and interests has a rich history - [dating to the beginnings of social science](https://research.bangor.ac.uk/portal/files/13878843/2016_Intersectional_individuality.pdf), when it was formulated by German-Jewish philosopher and psychologist, Moritz Lazarus, and carried on by intellectual heirs such as Georg Simmel and Charles Cooley.\n\nThese early writers argued that modernity was characterized by a more diversified life; that the mind of a person has greater variety of interests, affiliation, and personal projects than ever before. They imagine these affiliations and interests as a system of coordinates, with each additional group determining individuality more exactly.\n\n> \"A man may be regarded as the point of intersection of an indefinite number of circles representing social groups\"\n- Cooley, Human Nature and the Social Order (1922)\n\nCooley specifically [anticipated](https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Cooley/Cooley_1902/Cooley_1902e.html) that expanding individuality is connected with the \"growth of communication\". The blossoming of global communication networks on the internet has borne this out and given interested researchers in every field of study new tools for understanding what it is to be a social animal in a modern world:\n\n> ...beyond the fact that it is so immediately important in all of our lives, [the science of networks] cuts across fields: making sense of human networks draws on core concepts and studies from sociology, economics, math, physics, computer science, and anthropology.\n\n- Jackson, Matthew O.. The Human Network (p. 10). Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.\n\nIntersectional identity is a robust way to operationalize and understand identity, and the proliferation of digital networks has accelerated multidisciplinary research on this topic. As we will see, crypto network analysis deepens this field immensely, and opens it to more accessible and accurate study.\n\n### Problems with this View\n\nFor most of us, the freedom to create intersectional individuality has been achieved through progressive social movements. For example, first and second wave feminism in the United States expanded women's interests and affiliations through ownership of property, and integration with political and workplace groups. Other examples would include the Black Consciousness Movement in South Africa, and the Gay Rights Movement globally.\n\nLooking through an optimistic lens, modernity is a progressive march towards inclusion, which implies more group affiliation - a broader social life - and hence more individuality. Glen Weyl and Zoë Hitzig (2018) [give a colorful example](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3306738) of this, in what they consider to be a fully self-actualized individual in a liberal society:\n\n> One [example] is the gay nephew of the former ultra-orthodox chief rabbi of State of Israel. He is deeply steeped in nearly ever Jewish theological tradition and is ordained as a conservative rabbi, but runs a “God-optional” shul and was thrown out of the conservative rabbinate for marrying a Jew to a non-Jew. He knows and incorporates into his sermons more social theory and sociology than most rabbis, yet his shul is driven primarily by the contributions of a wide range of artists who draw on ancient Jewish traditions from all over the world.\n\n![Renée Cox, Chillin' with Liberty](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d10d9a15-5c05-4020-be8f-bf0259c529f4.jpeg?height=857&width=600)\n\nBut when considered holistically, the increasing multiplicity of our identities has benefited those belonging to some affiliations while, on a relative basis, been exponentially detrimental to others.\n\nThe [dominant use of the term \"intersectionality\"](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142) in social science today (starting with [Crenshaw, 1992](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1229039)), has built a framework for understanding of how oppression, derived from the combination of our social identities, is not merely additive, but at the least multiplicative:\n\n> How one form of oppression is experienced is influenced by and influences how another form is experienced. An additive analysis treats the oppression of a Black woman in a society that is racist as well as sexist as if it were a further burden when, in fact, it is a different burden ... sexism and racism must be seen as interlocking, and not as piled upon each other \n- [Spelman 1988](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/204131/inessential-woman-by-elizabeth-v-spelman/)\n\n> The term intersectionality references the critical insight that race, class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, nation, ability, and age operate not as unitary, mutually exclusive entities, but as reciprocally constructing phenomena that in turn shape complex social inequalities.\n- [Collins, 2015](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142)\n\nThese \"reciprocally constructing phenomena\" that may empower one person with increasing self-actualization, burden others with exponentially debilitating oppression. The fact that this extends to digital life can be deduced *a priori*, but examples are easy to generate: women are *more* targeted online than in real life, because of reduced friction to do so. Hate-speech is easier to propagate due to the algorithmically-amplified virality of content from polarized online groups.\n\nWhile we don't have long-term evidence for the efficacy of crypto networks as a tool for social liberation yet, crypto networks are unique in that they promise participants a highly functional \"persistent pseudonymity\" that has protective functions. An account on these networks do not necessarily reveal a person's nominal offline identity, but also allows its holder to participate in economic activity and exhibit individuality (e.g. group affiliation and taste), while hiding any unbidden or personal attributes likely to lead to oppression (e.g. nationality, race, gender, sex, etc).\n\n## NFTs as Cultural Objects with Socio-Economic Networks\n\n> Minting a token is an enactment of authenticity, an ontological shift in the history of representation.\n\n- A line from [A Feminist Manifesta of the Blockchain](https://hyperallergic.com/639180/a-feminist-manifesta-of-the-blockchain/) by Claudia Hart\n\nNew technologies allow artists to create objects that produce new meanings, social relations, and reputations within a field. Minting an NFT simultaneously creates art and its historical record.\n\n### Technology and Economic Networks in the Construction of Identity\n\nIn *Beethoven and the Construction of Genius,* Tia Nora explains how the invention of the pianoforte was a determinant of Beethoven's success in his early days as a composer; the new sounds evoking a greater range of emotional responses in listeners. But DeNora also examined the social and economic networks that supported Beethoven in Vienna, providing insight into the origins of his identity as the genius we regard him to be today:\n\n> [DeNora] examines more closely than anyone else just which aristocrats supported Beethoven, where they were in the complex Austrian hierarchy, why they backed him, and how this affected aesthetic perceptions. Her study provides substantial insight into the interworking between musical creation and production and the social forces that shape them... \n- [Broyles (1995)](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/161449671.pdf)\n\nNFTs are a technology that allow artists, patrons, and collectors to express and secure ownership of digital goods on a public ledger, and in doing so reveals preferences among and within socio-economic networks. This grants us an unprecedented view into the cultural norms of digital communities. For example, [Charlotte Kent (2021)](https://hyperallergic.com/652667/how-women-artists-have-been-marginalized-in-the-blockchain-discourse/) implicitly alludes to *generalized social exchange* occurring within communities of NFT artists:\n\n> “One notable feature of artists using blockchain is their interest in buying art with the funds they receive...This community-oriented attitude is reminiscent of early feminist practices”\n\nNFTs are cultural objects that not only bring new meaning, social relations and reputation online, but also allow us to express value for community-oriented attitudes and collective narratives. An excellent example of is the sale of the NFT “Dreaming at Dusk” (2021), for 500 ETH (~two million dollars at the time of auction, May 14). The NFT supports the Tor Project, which describes its mission as:\n\n> To advance human rights and freedoms by creating and deploying free and open source anonymity and privacy technologies, supporting their unrestricted availability and use, and furthering their scientific and popular understanding.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/35855)\n\nDreaming at Dusk was collected by a on-chain organization called PleasrDAO. We therefore have a metric that hypothetically assigns a cultural attitude to the PleasrDAO community - according to those values inherent in the Tor Project: human rights through open-source privacy technology. This would extend for any account that bid on the audition for this work, all publicly viewable on-chain. \n\nThe preference for art, expressed through bidding and collecting NFTs, can be a map for digital identity - for a community as well as an individual.\n\n### DAOs as Token-Driven Culture\n\nCulture can measured by embedded \"collective narratives\", expressed in a shared language (*schemas*) and knitted together in a consistent manner. These can produce moral norms (beliefs, attitudes, and values) that inform behavior. \n\n> People construct social reality via the development, transmission, and institutionalization of shared patterns of thinking across generations.\n\n- Measuring Culture (2020), p. 23\n\nShorn, Lotti & Hart (2019) articulate how blockchains enable the organic development of organizations that form shared consensus - conceived as a \"headless brand*\"*, in their iconic article, [Headless Brands](https://otherinter.net/web3/headless-brands/):\n\n> While brands have traditionally been planned and designed directly by corporations, the rise of networked media has challenged the coherence of centrally-managed brand identities. New blockchain-based decentralized organizations take this a step further by giving users financial incentive to spread brand narratives of their own...In this way, a brand operates as a consensus system, facilitating a consistent set of beliefs across people.\n\nBeyond brands, social communities in general are beginning to proliferate around tokens. Friends with Benefits is one such example, whereby the access to the community and its productive capacity is gated by ownership of the token, and holders of the token are financially incentivized to increase its value. Members are interdependent within the community, and work to make it better without any formal organizational hierarchy - bound only by their values:\n\n> Friends with Benefits started as a private Discord server populated by our favorite thinkers and has since evolved into a global community bound together by shared values, shared incentives ($FWB) and shared IRL + URL experiences\n\n- [Evolution of the FWB DAO](https://zhang.mirror.xyz/9sRa2kNDUpkWoQkWw67bJ8PczFyTSX8fotf7JOddxew) - Alex Zhang (2021)\n\nBlockchains allow for people to play new kinds of coordination games, empowered by shared narratives and enacted by a decentralized organization of users. The classic example of a DAO is Bitcoin, which incentivizes millions of people to add labor to the project (in the form of marketing, research, or software development), without formally employing a single person. Although DAOs might have a core development team, or individuals who can influence the DAO's participants, there is no executive board with special powers.\n\nAs the number of people \"working for\" these DAOs expands, it takes on grander proportions, as articulated in [DAOs, Democracy and Governance](http://merkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf), 2016, by Ralph C. Merkle:\n\n> Modern research into “the wisdom of crowds” provides new insights into how to combine the expertise of all participants without handing over control to “experts”. Combined with research on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), this allows us to design a new form of democracy which is more stable, less prone to erratic behavior, better able to meet the needs of its citizens, and which better uses the expertise of all its citizens to make high-quality decisions. We call this new form of democracy a DAO Democracy.\n\nTaken to its most grand proportion, is Balaji's idea of starting a \"Crypto Civilization\":\n\n[https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1269178671086006273?s=20](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1269178671086006273?s=20)\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis post begins to explain how individual identity, viewed as the intersection of our social affiliations and tastes, is an emergent property of blockchain interactions. The richness of our on-chain identities increases as more people and content move onto these networks.\n\nWhile state-issued *formal identities* (e.g. SSN number) and corporation-issued informal identities (e.g. a Facebook login) entail severe security risks through centralization and a high decree of artificiality, decentralized identities promise persistent pseudonymity, while enabling economic cooperation and a greater expression of individuality through the collection of digital cultural objects and participation in DAOs. \n\nThis is a field in its infancy, but it clear that there is potential for crossover among the fields of computer science, network analysis, economic sociology, and many others, in the understanding of our on-chain identities.\n\nIf the use of blockchains continue to proliferate as they have so far, this may become one of the most meaningful fields of study in human history.", "timestamp": 1623796039, "digest": "17-QuzdJJ0n-WGtuFiSXpH13-F3XCBgiPYCRtKANwc8", "contributor": "0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026"}

An account on these networks do not necessarily reveal a person's nominal offline identity, but also allows its holder to participate in economic activity and exhibit individuality (e.g. group affiliation and taste), while hiding any unbidden or personal attributes likely to lead to oppression (e.g. nationality, race, gender, sex, etc).\n\n## NFTs as Cultural Objects with Socio-Economic Networks\n\n> Minting a token is an enactment of authenticity, an ontological shift in the history of representation.\n\n- A line from [A Feminist Manifesta of the Blockchain](https://hyperallergic.com/639180/a-feminist-manifesta-of-the-blockchain/) by Claudia Hart\n\nNew technologies allow artists to create objects that produce new meanings, social relations, and reputations within a field. Minting an NFT simultaneously creates art and its historical record.\n\n### Technology and Economic Networks in the Construction of Identity\n\nIn *Beethoven and the Construction of Genius,* Tia Nora explains how the invention of the pianoforte was a determinant of Beethoven's success in his early days as a composer; the new sounds evoking a greater range of emotional responses in listeners. But DeNora also examined the social and economic networks that supported Beethoven in Vienna, providing insight into the origins of his identity as the genius we regard him to be today:\n\n> [DeNora] examines more closely than anyone else just which aristocrats supported Beethoven, where they were in the complex Austrian hierarchy, why they backed him, and how this affected aesthetic perceptions. Her study provides substantial insight into the interworking between musical creation and production and the social forces that shape them... \n- [Broyles (1995)](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/161449671.pdf)\n\nNFTs are a technology that allow artists, patrons, and collectors to express and secure ownership of digital goods on a public ledger, and in doing so reveals preferences among and within socio-economic networks. This grants us an unprecedented view into the cultural norms of digital communities. For example, [Charlotte Kent (2021)](https://hyperallergic.com/652667/how-women-artists-have-been-marginalized-in-the-blockchain-discourse/) implicitly alludes to *generalized social exchange* occurring within communities of NFT artists:\n\n> “One notable feature of artists using blockchain is their interest in buying art with the funds they receive...This community-oriented attitude is reminiscent of early feminist practices”\n\nNFTs are cultural objects that not only bring new meaning, social relations and reputation online, but also allow us to express value for community-oriented attitudes and collective narratives. An excellent example of is the sale of the NFT “Dreaming at Dusk” (2021), for 500 ETH (~two million dollars at the time of auction, May 14). The NFT supports the Tor Project, which describes its mission as:\n\n> To advance human rights and freedoms by creating and deploying free and open source anonymity and privacy technologies, supporting their unrestricted availability and use, and furthering their scientific and popular understanding.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/35855)\n\nDreaming at Dusk was collected by a on-chain organization called PleasrDAO. We therefore have a metric that hypothetically assigns a cultural attitude to the PleasrDAO community - according to those values inherent in the Tor Project: human rights through open-source privacy technology. This would extend for any account that bid on the audition for this work, all publicly viewable on-chain. \n\nThe preference for art, expressed through bidding and collecting NFTs, can be a map for digital identity - for a community as well as an individual.\n\n### DAOs as Token-Driven Culture\n\nCulture can measured by embedded \"collective narratives\", expressed in a shared language (*schemas*) and knitted together in a consistent manner. These can produce moral norms (beliefs, attitudes, and values) that inform behavior. \n\n> People construct social reality via the development, transmission, and institutionalization of shared patterns of thinking across generations.\n\n- Measuring Culture (2020), p. 23\n\nShorn, Lotti & Hart (2019) articulate how blockchains enable the organic development of organizations that form shared consensus - conceived as a \"headless brand*\"*, in their iconic article, [Headless Brands](https://otherinter.net/web3/headless-brands/):\n\n> While brands have traditionally been planned and designed directly by corporations, the rise of networked media has challenged the coherence of centrally-managed brand identities. New blockchain-based decentralized organizations take this a step further by giving users financial incentive to spread brand narratives of their own...In this way, a brand operates as a consensus system, facilitating a consistent set of beliefs across people.\n\nBeyond brands, social communities in general are beginning to proliferate around tokens. Friends with Benefits is one such example, whereby the access to the community and its productive capacity is gated by ownership of the token, and holders of the token are financially incentivized to increase its value. Members are interdependent within the community, and work to make it better without any formal organizational hierarchy - bound only by their values:\n\n> Friends with Benefits started as a private Discord server populated by our favorite thinkers and has since evolved into a global community bound together by shared values, shared incentives ($FWB) and shared IRL + URL experiences\n\n- [Evolution of the FWB DAO](https://zhang.mirror.xyz/9sRa2kNDUpkWoQkWw67bJ8PczFyTSX8fotf7JOddxew) - Alex Zhang (2021)\n\nBlockchains allow for people to play new kinds of coordination games, empowered by shared narratives and enacted by a decentralized organization of users. The classic example of a DAO is Bitcoin, which incentivizes millions of people to add labor to the project (in the form of marketing, research, or software development), without formally employing a single person. Although DAOs might have a core development team, or individuals who can influence the DAO's participants, there is no executive board with special powers.\n\nAs the number of people \"working for\" these DAOs expands, it takes on grander proportions, as articulated in [DAOs, Democracy and Governance](http://merkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf), 2016, by Ralph C. Merkle:\n\n> Modern research into “the wisdom of crowds” provides new insights into how to combine the expertise of all participants without handing over control to “experts”. Combined with research on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), this allows us to design a new form of democracy which is more stable, less prone to erratic behavior, better able to meet the needs of its citizens, and which better uses the expertise of all its citizens to make high-quality decisions. We call this new form of democracy a DAO Democracy.\n\nTaken to its most grand proportion, is Balaji's idea of starting a \"Crypto Civilization\":\n\n[https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1269178671086006273?s=20](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1269178671086006273?s=20)\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis post begins to explain how individual identity, viewed as the intersection of our social affiliations and tastes, is an emergent property of blockchain interactions. The richness of our on-chain identities increases as more people and content move onto these networks.\n\nWhile state-issued *formal identities* (e.g. SSN number) and corporation-issued informal identities (e.g. a Facebook login) entail severe security risks through centralization and a high decree of artificiality, decentralized identities promise persistent pseudonymity, while enabling economic cooperation and a greater expression of individuality through the collection of digital cultural objects and participation in DAOs. \n\nThis is a field in its infancy, but it clear that there is potential for crossover among the fields of computer science, network analysis, economic sociology, and many others, in the understanding of our on-chain identities.\n\nIf the use of blockchains continue to proliferate as they have so far, this may become one of the most meaningful fields of study in human history.", "timestamp": 1623796362, "digest": "17-QuzdJJ0n-WGtuFiSXpH13-F3XCBgiPYCRtKANwc8", "contributor": "0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026"}

We cultivate identity, consciously or subconsciously, to make us feel good about ourselves, to give us status. \n\nToday, with 75% of young people spending almost all of their time online, a portion of our identity construction has moved to the social web, resulting in modern-era digital identities that are independent of nation states.\n\nSimilarly to how state-issued identities allowed citizens to work and live in urban environments, corporation-issued web identities have allowed users to log in and use online services - such as media streaming via YouTube, or mobile payments via Venmo.\n\nBut the centralization inherent in the storage and control of these identities presents numerous challenges, including exponential security risks, and an artificial and reductive social identity.\n\nIn a separate vein of the internet, decentralization of value in the form of blockchain-based digital assets - including stablecoins, community tokens, and NFT artworks - have exploded in popularity. \n\nThe blockchain technology underlying this movement has mainly been used for public financial accounting of these assets; as peer-to-peer \"ledgers\" that enable financial transactions without an intermediary. Its primary strengths are censorship resistance and guaranteed execution.\n\nBut a public ledger also implies an accessible, auditable, temporally ordered record of interactions among users - such as purchasing art, or lending currency. Analysis of the contents of these ledgers invites narrative generation with regards to its account holders, which births a new crypto-economic sociology. Identity, understood as *what is known* about us by others, can therefore be represented by information stored on blockchains. \n\nI hold that the major disciplines that study identity guide us towards a conception of individuality that is represented well by blockchains, and that blockchains are the best tool that we have for expanding, formalizing, and protecting our identities in a socially progressive way.\n\nI explain how on-chain \"intersectional identity\" can be constructed from token ownership networks that reveal group affiliation, and *taste* - viewing NFTs as cultural objects with shared significance.\n\nI leave out the fact that many systemic problems observed in social media, including [political polarization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bu5l9HREZE), security threats, and other malicious personal attacks, may be mitigated by the increased use of pseudonymous digital identities. I also avoid specific implementations for on-chain identity. Both of these topics are well covered elsewhere. \n\nFinally, I am not a proponent of \"identity protocols\", but, as this post suggests, I view identity as an emergent property of interconnected crypto networks and the activity on them.\n\n## **Intersectional Identity**\n\nThe concept that individuality is the intersection of a person's group affiliations and interests has a rich history - [dating to the beginnings of social science](https://research.bangor.ac.uk/portal/files/13878843/2016_Intersectional_individuality.pdf), when it was formulated by German-Jewish philosopher and psychologist, Moritz Lazarus, and carried on by intellectual heirs such as Georg Simmel and Charles Cooley.\n\nThese early writers argued that modernity was characterized by a more diversified life; that the mind of a person has greater variety of interests, affiliation, and personal projects than ever before. They imagine these affiliations and interests as a system of coordinates, with each additional group determining individuality more exactly.\n\n> \"A man may be regarded as the point of intersection of an indefinite number of circles representing social groups\"\n- Cooley, Human Nature and the Social Order (1922)\n\nCooley specifically [anticipated](https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Cooley/Cooley_1902/Cooley_1902e.html) that expanding individuality is connected with the \"growth of communication\". The blossoming of global communication networks on the internet has borne this out and given interested researchers in every field of study new tools for understanding what it is to be a social animal in a modern world:\n\n> ...beyond the fact that it is so immediately important in all of our lives, [the science of networks] cuts across fields: making sense of human networks draws on core concepts and studies from sociology, economics, math, physics, computer science, and anthropology.\n\n- Jackson, Matthew O.. The Human Network (p. 10). Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.\n\nIntersectional identity is a robust way to operationalize and understand identity, and the proliferation of digital networks has accelerated multidisciplinary research on this topic. As we will see, crypto network analysis deepens this field immensely, and opens it to more accessible and accurate study.\n\n### Problems with this View\n\nFor most of us, the freedom to create intersectional individuality has been achieved through progressive social movements. For example, first and second wave feminism in the United States expanded women's interests and affiliations through ownership of property, and integration with political and workplace groups. Other examples would include the Black Consciousness Movement in South Africa, and the Gay Rights Movement globally.\n\nLooking through an optimistic lens, modernity is a progressive march towards inclusion, which implies more group affiliation - a broader social life - and hence more individuality. Glen Weyl and Zoë Hitzig (2018) [give a colorful example](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3306738) of this, in what they consider to be a fully self-actualized individual in a liberal society:\n\n> One [example] is the gay nephew of the former ultra-orthodox chief rabbi of State of Israel. He is deeply steeped in nearly ever Jewish theological tradition and is ordained as a conservative rabbi, but runs a “God-optional” shul and was thrown out of the conservative rabbinate for marrying a Jew to a non-Jew. He knows and incorporates into his sermons more social theory and sociology than most rabbis, yet his shul is driven primarily by the contributions of a wide range of artists who draw on ancient Jewish traditions from all over the world.\n\n![Renée Cox, Chillin' with Liberty displays a vibrant visual mix of identities, from that of the painful distant-historical, to the brave and forward-looking, and from the sexual to the militant.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d10d9a15-5c05-4020-be8f-bf0259c529f4.jpeg?height=857&width=600)\n\nBut when considered holistically, the increasing multiplicity of our identities has benefited those belonging to some affiliations while, on a relative basis, been exponentially detrimental to others.\n\nThe [dominant use of the term \"intersectionality\"](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142) in social science today (starting with [Crenshaw, 1992](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1229039)), has built a framework for understanding of how oppression, derived from the combination of our social identities, is not merely additive, but at the least multiplicative:\n\n> How one form of oppression is experienced is influenced by and influences how another form is experienced. An additive analysis treats the oppression of a Black woman in a society that is racist as well as sexist as if it were a further burden when, in fact, it is a different burden ... sexism and racism must be seen as interlocking, and not as piled upon each other \n- [Spelman 1988](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/204131/inessential-woman-by-elizabeth-v-spelman/)\n\n> The term intersectionality references the critical insight that race, class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, nation, ability, and age operate not as unitary, mutually exclusive entities, but as reciprocally constructing phenomena that in turn shape complex social inequalities.\n- [Collins, 2015](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142)\n\nThese \"reciprocally constructing phenomena\" that may empower one person with increasing self-actualization, burden others with exponentially debilitating oppression.

An account on these networks do not necessarily reveal a person's nominal offline identity, but also allows its holder to participate in economic activity and exhibit individuality (e.g. group affiliation and taste), while hiding any unbidden or personal attributes likely to lead to oppression (e.g. nationality, race, gender, sex, etc).\n\n![Renée Cox, Chillin' with Liberty displays a vibrant visual mix of identities, from that of the painful distant-historical, to the brave and forward-looking, and from the sexual to the militant.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d10d9a15-5c05-4020-be8f-bf0259c529f4.jpeg?height=857&width=600)\n\n## NFTs as Cultural Objects with Socio-Economic Networks\n\n> Minting a token is an enactment of authenticity, an ontological shift in the history of representation.\n\n- A line from [A Feminist Manifesta of the Blockchain](https://hyperallergic.com/639180/a-feminist-manifesta-of-the-blockchain/) by Claudia Hart\n\nNew technologies allow artists to create objects that produce new meanings, social relations, and reputations within a field. Minting an NFT simultaneously creates art and its historical record.\n\n### Technology and Economic Networks in the Construction of Identity\n\nIn *Beethoven and the Construction of Genius,* Tia Nora explains how the invention of the pianoforte was a determinant of Beethoven's success in his early days as a composer; the new sounds evoking a greater range of emotional responses in listeners. But DeNora also examined the social and economic networks that supported Beethoven in Vienna, providing insight into the origins of his identity as the genius we regard him to be today:\n\n> [DeNora] examines more closely than anyone else just which aristocrats supported Beethoven, where they were in the complex Austrian hierarchy, why they backed him, and how this affected aesthetic perceptions. Her study provides substantial insight into the interworking between musical creation and production and the social forces that shape them... \n- [Broyles (1995)](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/161449671.pdf)\n\nNFTs are a technology that allow artists, patrons, and collectors to express and secure ownership of digital goods on a public ledger, and in doing so reveals preferences among and within socio-economic networks. This grants us an unprecedented view into the cultural norms of digital communities. For example, [Charlotte Kent (2021)](https://hyperallergic.com/652667/how-women-artists-have-been-marginalized-in-the-blockchain-discourse/) implicitly alludes to *generalized social exchange* occurring within communities of NFT artists:\n\n> “One notable feature of artists using blockchain is their interest in buying art with the funds they receive...This community-oriented attitude is reminiscent of early feminist practices”\n\nNFTs are cultural objects that not only bring new meaning, social relations and reputation online, but also allow us to express value for community-oriented attitudes and collective narratives. An excellent example of is the sale of the NFT “Dreaming at Dusk” (2021), for 500 ETH (~two million dollars at the time of auction, May 14). The NFT supports the Tor Project, which describes its mission as:\n\n> To advance human rights and freedoms by creating and deploying free and open source anonymity and privacy technologies, supporting their unrestricted availability and use, and furthering their scientific and popular understanding.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/35855)\n\nDreaming at Dusk was collected by a on-chain organization called PleasrDAO. We therefore have a metric that hypothetically assigns a cultural attitude to the PleasrDAO community - according to those values inherent in the Tor Project: human rights through open-source privacy technology. This would extend for any account that bid on the audition for this work, all publicly viewable on-chain. \n\nThe preference for art, expressed through bidding and collecting NFTs, can be a map for digital identity - for a community as well as an individual.\n\n### DAOs as Token-Driven Culture\n\nCulture can measured by embedded \"collective narratives\", expressed in a shared language (*schemas*) and knitted together in a consistent manner. These can produce moral norms (beliefs, attitudes, and values) that inform behavior. \n\n> People construct social reality via the development, transmission, and institutionalization of shared patterns of thinking across generations.\n\n- Measuring Culture (2020), p. 23\n\nShorn, Lotti & Hart (2019) articulate how blockchains enable the organic development of organizations that form shared consensus - conceived as a \"headless brand*\"*, in their iconic article, [Headless Brands](https://otherinter.net/web3/headless-brands/):\n\n> While brands have traditionally been planned and designed directly by corporations, the rise of networked media has challenged the coherence of centrally-managed brand identities. New blockchain-based decentralized organizations take this a step further by giving users financial incentive to spread brand narratives of their own...In this way, a brand operates as a consensus system, facilitating a consistent set of beliefs across people.\n\nBeyond brands, social communities in general are beginning to proliferate around tokens. Friends with Benefits is one such example, whereby the access to the community and its productive capacity is gated by ownership of the token, and holders of the token are financially incentivized to increase its value. Members are interdependent within the community, and work to make it better without any formal organizational hierarchy - bound only by their values:\n\n> Friends with Benefits started as a private Discord server populated by our favorite thinkers and has since evolved into a global community bound together by shared values, shared incentives ($FWB) and shared IRL + URL experiences\n\n- [Evolution of the FWB DAO](https://zhang.mirror.xyz/9sRa2kNDUpkWoQkWw67bJ8PczFyTSX8fotf7JOddxew) - Alex Zhang (2021)\n\nBlockchains allow for people to play new kinds of coordination games, empowered by shared narratives and enacted by a decentralized organization of users. The classic example of a DAO is Bitcoin, which incentivizes millions of people to add labor to the project (in the form of marketing, research, or software development), without formally employing a single person. Although DAOs might have a core development team, or individuals who can influence the DAO's participants, there is no executive board with special powers.\n\nAs the number of people \"working for\" these DAOs expands, it takes on grander proportions, as articulated in [DAOs, Democracy and Governance](http://merkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf), 2016, by Ralph C. Merkle:\n\n> Modern research into “the wisdom of crowds” provides new insights into how to combine the expertise of all participants without handing over control to “experts”. Combined with research on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), this allows us to design a new form of democracy which is more stable, less prone to erratic behavior, better able to meet the needs of its citizens, and which better uses the expertise of all its citizens to make high-quality decisions. We call this new form of democracy a DAO Democracy.\n\nTaken to its most grand proportion, is Balaji's idea of starting a \"Crypto Civilization\":\n\n[https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1269178671086006273?s=20](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1269178671086006273?s=20)\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis post begins to explain how individual identity, viewed as the intersection of our social affiliations and tastes, is an emergent property of blockchain interactions. The richness of our on-chain identities increases as more people and content move onto these networks.\n\nWhile state-issued *formal identities* (e.g. SSN number) and corporation-issued informal identities (e.g. a Facebook login) entail severe security risks through centralization and a high decree of artificiality, decentralized identities promise persistent pseudonymity, while enabling economic cooperation and a greater expression of individuality through the collection of digital cultural objects and participation in DAOs. \n\nThis is a field in its infancy, but it clear that there is potential for crossover among the fields of computer science, network analysis, economic sociology, and many others, in the understanding of our on-chain identities.\n\nIf the use of blockchains continue to proliferate as they have so far, this may become one of the most meaningful fields of study in human history.", "timestamp": 1623796476, "digest": "17-QuzdJJ0n-WGtuFiSXpH13-F3XCBgiPYCRtKANwc8", "contributor": "0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026"}

The space has you covered for anything ranging from [peer-to-protocol lending protocols](https://aave.com/) to [insurance policies that protect users from loss of funds due to protocol bugs](https://nexusmutual.io/). Derivative protocols like [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) have you covered for any investments in non ETH-based assets, and you need look no further than [Opyn](https://www.opyn.co/) for all your cash-settled options trading needs. \n\nThe space is quickly starting to resemble a fully functional financial system, with all the applications and systems needed for standard retail investor transactions established and regularly audited, but also the most niche structured products thriving and innovating further with every passing day. \n\nHowever, the most striking difference is that DeFi is trying to do what TradFi (Traditional Finance) did over the past 2,000 years in just a couple of years. This is in large part due to the power of true and native [composability](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-true-power-of-defi-composability-14fe8355e0d0#:~:text=Composability%2C%20in%20DeFi%2C%20is%20the,and%20therefore%20each%20other's%20utility.). It will then catch up to a point of no return where it can eventually step over and replace it. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6d974fc1-8031-47f3-9f5b-4bda5509abc9.png?height=700&width=1801)\n\nThe future is bright for DeFi, and the space is always vibrant and full of energy, no matter the state of the overall crypto market. We are still a while away from widespread adoption of DeFi, and as many people often say, \"we are still early\". [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), the most popular chrome extension based wallet used to interact with DeFi, only recently reached 5 million monthly active users. Mainstream adoption too soon would potentially come at the wrong time for DeFi because many of the applications would not be ready to properly support the extreme volume, but I have had a lot of time to think about this problem lately and have come to some conclusions about what I think needs to happen in the space before it is fully ready.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/76a440fa-1ae5-443a-97fd-356ebd1a0f25.png?height=848&width=2152)\n\nI call these factors **the Three \"U\"s of DeFi Ubiquity**.\n\n#### Usability\n\nThe first, and arguably most important of these hurdles to ubiquity, is usability. Many of the most successful DeFi protocols are advanced, regularly audited and professionally run but have user interfaces that are unapproachable to all but the most sophisticated investors. In reality, the service they are offering is an enabler for the democratisation of many financial instruments previously unavailable to most investors, and a lot of this innovation is going unnoticed due to complex UX. \n\nThe key to this issue is going to be knowing which parts of the UI to hide, and which to display prominently. [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) is one of the market leaders in keeping its UI simple yet powerful. Still, there will eventually be a divergence of the consumer level interfaces and pro-level interfaces using the same backend, a bit like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) vs [Coinbase **Pro**](https://pro.coinbase.com) to really drive this point home. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) does not focus greatly on UI refinement at the moment, but it will take a beginner-friendly browser wallet that has a good fiat on-ramp and perhaps doesn't even refer to itself as a wallet but more as a [key to Web3](https://rainbow.me) to really help push DApps into the mainstream.\n\nIncreasingly we will start to see startups cropping up worldwide in various industries focusing on leveraging DeFi technologies to verticalise and fine-tune the experience for different audiences with different financial preferences. The technology behind many of the most popular DeFi protocols is fine-tuned and optimised for scale, performance and reliability, so there is a wide-open opportunity for startups to come into specific geographies such as developing economies, where debt financing for small businesses is harder to come by, and build a straightforward front end. This front end could then automatically tap into the sea of open-source protocols and liquidity that is readily available. It could then focus on making it accessible to non-crypto-native audiences with seamless on-ramps for Fiat which, in the future, could allow someone in Venezuela to take out a loan using stablecoins on [AAVE](http://aave.com/) using an [L2 solution like Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) without ever noticing that they have done all of this on a trustless and decentralised back end.\n\nIdeally, customers would eventually be aware of the fact that they are interacting with DeFi, but in order to reach a truly mainstream audience there will be a transitionary period where perhaps these front ends do not lean too heavily into the crypto angle. This movement comes straight out of the playbook of new Fintech startups like [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) and [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/) that have spent the past decade taking complex financial systems, reducing their complexity and making them accessible to retail investors. These startups often build on top of TradFi and reduce friction for retail users by bending the rules or by [bundling transactions together](https://www.freetrade.io). DeFi could use the same approach and reduce friction even further. It is unlikely that this simplified DeFi front end innovation will come from the existing Fintech incumbents because the way they are used to working is so different to the way DeFi works. TradFi Fintech startups are used to pushing up against and fighting the traditional systems to try and squeeze them into a user experience that is pleasant to use. The DeFi space is flexible by design so the approach taken by these verticalised DeFi gateways will be simple, and even encouraged by the protocols themselves, contrary to the struggles faced by TradFi Fintech startups. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/619cb9ed-b108-46e9-af75-3b211568bb06.png?height=806&width=1825)\n\nWhile there will be many independent startups fulfilling this function and maybe even getting funded through the protocols' own grants DAOs, many of these usability improvements will also come from the protocols' own core teams, especially on the institutional side. TradFi tends to prefer interacting directly with the people that built the technology they are going to be leveraging. [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) has actually started experimenting with [permissioned pools for institutional investors](https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-lending-platform-aave-reveals-private-pool-for-institutions) because institutional investors previously found it tough to use the protocol due to lack of [KYC and AML](https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/kyc-aml-know-your-customer-vs-anti-money-laundering/) compliance, and this has allowed banks and other institutional clients using [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) to know that the other parties in the network are compliant and vetted not to be on an [OFAC sanctions list](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information). This is just another example of DeFi slightly adapting to TradFi without compromising on their core principles as an almost intermediate stage to mainstream adoption. Whether that be through making it feel like Fiat through stable-coins, or increasing KYC for institutions to help them to feel more at ease about the protocols they are transacting with, these measures all go a long way towards lowering hurdles to mass adoption. Conversely, we may even slowly start to see the key protocols start to phase out their consumer-focused front ends and instead outsource that part of their business out to third party startups building on top of their protocols, all whilst focusing primarily on the back end and core functionality.\n\nThe runway is wide open, and the tech is ready. These protocols exist and are being built and tested by thousands of users every day. The best part is that anyone can come in and make them more useful to any specific demographic. Look no further than projects like [Ribbon](https://www.ribbon.finance) or even some of the high-quality DeFi aggregators like [Zerion](https://zerion.io/) or [Zapper](https://zapper.fi/) to see this in action. [Ribbon](htts://www.ribbon.finance) has made some sophisticated covered call strategies available to anyone with a [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io/) by building directly on [Opyn's](https://www.opyn.co/) cash-settled ETH options protocol, all while making it feel as simple as an, admittedly high-risk, savings account to the end-user.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0ec888-d3db-4856-af1d-48280478715d.png?height=851&width=2325)\n\n#### Undercolateralisation \n\nThe second hurdle is the issue of overcolateralisation in DeFi lending protocols. When you put the whole DeFi stack together, what you are left with is essentially a fully decentralised crypto bank that runs itself in the most traditional sense of the word. DeFi, just like a bank, allows you to convert between currencies, deposit money and receive interest in return for providing liquidity to the bank to then allow them to loan it back out. On the other side of the equation, anyone can then go to the bank, take out a loan and then pay it back at a rate most suited to their risk profile and time horizon. In TradFi some loans are unsecured, but many are secured in that they have some form of collateral backing the loan. If you fail to pay back said loan, the traditional bank has the legal authority to repossess that asset and liquidate it in exchange for cash. The percentage of the total loan required as collateral often depends on a credit score and past successful repayment of loans. Some traditional bank loans are overcollateralised when the asset is highly illiquid to make sure that enough cash can be recouped in the event of a loan default. Conversely in most DeFi lending protocols, you need to provide significantly more crypto as collateral than the stable-coins you are borrowing, sometimes as much as 700%.\n\nIt can be hard to understand why someone would ever want to take out a loan worth less than the amount they are putting down as collateral, and whilst there are some valid reasons for this such as delaying a taxable event or increasing leverage on positions through complex financial gymnastics, the vast majority of the world is unwilling or more importantly unable to borrow money in this way. The main reason people borrow money is precisely that they do not have the spare capital available at that time. People take out mortgages to buy houses, or take out loans to start a small restaurant in their hometown. Sometimes your mortgage may even start highly collateralised but later turns undercollateralised if the value of the house goes down, and due to the credit history of the borrower, the loan is still able to remain a _performing loan_. However, the downside of undercollateralisation is that if the loan were to default, the collateral would not be able to cover the principal. In this case, the borrower would step in to cover the difference if they are in fact creditworthy and have some reputational skin in the game. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/17b662fe-a9af-4b5c-afda-aeb07b88e131.png?height=845&width=2138)\n\nTo cater properly to these kinds of users it is important that DeFi eventually gets to a point where loans can be undercollateralised in some way. The difficulty is that DeFi is by its very nature anonymous and trustless, which means that the concept of social proof and credit scores becomes very difficult to handle. A potential solution could be a quasi-anonymous loan passport solution in which the user is anonymous on one dimension but not on another, i.e. their wallet address is public, but the owner of the wallet is not. One could, in theory, understand someone's creditworthiness through their past loans/wallet history, which is of course publicly visible on Web3 or even decrease the user's collateral requirement for their next loan by a certain percentage every time they repay successfully. Another alternative is allowing user loans to be backed/secured by other individuals they know in real life that trust the borrower enough to guarantee their loan and [delegate their credit](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/credit-delegation). Perhaps we could even see some CeFi institutions step in to perform credit checks on DeFi users on a per address basis. This solution would, of course, introduce some centralisation as it would involve real-identity based KYC, but may be a necessary interim solution for users that prioritise a low collateral ratio over absolute anonymity as lending protocols like AAVE could eventually introduce pools of loans where a trusted third party has verified creditworthiness in advance. \n\nThere are already some great projects being built in this space like [teller.finance](https://www.teller.finance/) which is taking a similar approach by connecting to your bank account through [Plaid](https://plaid.com/). Although we are still a while away from a foolproof creditworthiness checker solution in DeFi there are many different approaches one can take and I believe a combination of these approaches will play a large part in solving the issue of collateralisation in the quest for widespread adoption.\n\n#### Understability\n\nThe final hurdle that, depending on how you look at things could be the hardest or easiest of these to solve, is the difficulty around understandability and education. This hurdle may ultimately solve itself if the first two issues are solved and DeFi starts to resemble the way in which users are used to dealing with and thinking about finances. However, it is still important to acknowledge that for non-technical people, the DeFi space can be very opaque and consequently more difficult to trust.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/46fc773f-114b-42c0-b1db-eade3492e306.png?height=697&width=2015)\n\nFiat money and the way centralised traditional financial systems work is deeply ingrained in our culture and is a little easier to properly comprehend because many parts of the system rely on trust and simple written agreements which come together to form financial systems. Understanding the way these systems work in DeFi is a lot less straightforward. While in TradFi it is relatively straightforward to explain the basics of how a bank works, in that one can deposit money, and in return the bank lends that money out and pays interest for that privilege. There are very few parts of that process that are opaque because, ultimately, it just involves numbers moving from one spreadsheet to another.\n\nThe difference with DeFi is that you first have to feel comfortable with the concept of decentralisation, anonymity, trustless systems, distributed ledgers, and then you have to try and explain how all of this functions automatically through smart-contracts. There are many parts of DeFi that have to be hand-waved away and perhaps this could become a hindrance to trust. \n\nOne could also, of course, argue that many people implicitly trust the banking system because enough other trusted people do and not because they understand every part of the process. The same could eventually be true when enough knowledgeable people trust DeFi and understand a good enough percentage of the current information gaps. \n\nThere are some great resources out there like [Finematics](https://finematics.com/) and [Bankless](https://banklesshq.com/) doing amazing things in the education space and teaching newcomers about all things DeFi. I think this will be crucial in making sure people are comfortable enough with the technology to use it, especially when currently decentralisation slightly goes against the grain and users may be met with scepticism from friends and family. \n\n\n\nOverall the space is going in all the right directions. It will take a while for these ideas to materialise fully, but this is the part that interests me the most about the DeFi space. There is so much mind-blowing R&D going on every day, and people are experimenting, taking risks and breaking boundaries. Therefore, I'm very passionate about making sure as many people as possible have access to these tools and can take part in the revolution. Understanding the pieces of the puzzle left to fill will become more and more important as more protocols are built out and refined.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this piece 😊 It's a topic that has been on my mind for the past couple of months and I really enjoyed laying out and structuring my thoughts on the matter. \n\nIf you enjoyed the piece and are interested in receiving more of my content or keeping up to date with anything else I get up to a follow on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/coconidodev) would be great... or if you're more of an email person that works too - subscribe to my infrequent mailing newsletter via the link below.", "timestamp": 1623796764, "digest": "klQF-dVD9TOVI288YuTObvBVY5_GsrmBGDunRoWpYt8", "contributor": "0xcde3725B25D6d9bC78CF0941cC15Fd9710c764b9"}

The DeFi space is flexible by design so the approach taken by these verticalised DeFi gateways will be simple, and even encouraged by the protocols themselves, contrary to the struggles faced by TradFi Fintech startups. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/619cb9ed-b108-46e9-af75-3b211568bb06.png?height=806&width=1825)\n\nWhile there will be many independent startups fulfilling this function and maybe even getting funded through the protocols' own grants DAOs, many of these usability improvements will also come from the protocols' own core teams, especially on the institutional side. TradFi tends to prefer interacting directly with the people that built the technology they are going to be leveraging. [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) has actually started experimenting with [permissioned pools for institutional investors](https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-lending-platform-aave-reveals-private-pool-for-institutions) because institutional investors previously found it tough to use the protocol due to lack of [KYC and AML](https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/kyc-aml-know-your-customer-vs-anti-money-laundering/) compliance, and this has allowed banks and other institutional clients using [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) to know that the other parties in the network are compliant and vetted not to be on an [OFAC sanctions list](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information). This is just another example of DeFi slightly adapting to TradFi without compromising on their core principles as an almost intermediate stage to mainstream adoption. Whether that be through making it feel like Fiat through stable-coins, or increasing KYC for institutions to help them to feel more at ease about the protocols they are transacting with, these measures all go a long way towards lowering hurdles to mass adoption. Conversely, we may even slowly start to see the key protocols start to phase out their consumer-focused front ends and instead outsource that part of their business out to third party startups building on top of their protocols, all whilst focusing primarily on the back end and core functionality.\n\nThe runway is wide open, and the tech is ready. These protocols exist and are being built and tested by thousands of users every day. The best part is that anyone can come in and make them more useful to any specific demographic. Look no further than projects like [Ribbon](https://www.ribbon.finance) or even some of the high-quality DeFi aggregators like [Zerion](https://zerion.io/) or [Zapper](https://zapper.fi/) to see this in action. [Ribbon](htts://www.ribbon.finance) has made some sophisticated covered call strategies available to anyone with a [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io/) by building directly on [Opyn's](https://www.opyn.co/) cash-settled ETH options protocol, all while making it feel as simple as an, admittedly high-risk, savings account to the end-user.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0ec888-d3db-4856-af1d-48280478715d.png?height=851&width=2325)\n\n#### Undercolateralisation \n\nThe second hurdle is the issue of overcolateralisation in DeFi lending protocols. When you put the whole DeFi stack together, what you are left with is essentially a fully decentralised crypto bank that runs itself in the most traditional sense of the word. DeFi, just like a bank, allows you to convert between currencies, deposit money and receive interest in return for providing liquidity to the bank to then allow them to loan it back out. On the other side of the equation, anyone can then go to the bank, take out a loan and then pay it back at a rate most suited to their risk profile and time horizon. In TradFi some loans are unsecured, but many are secured in that they have some form of collateral backing the loan. If you fail to pay back said loan, the traditional bank has the legal authority to repossess that asset and liquidate it in exchange for cash. The percentage of the total loan required as collateral often depends on a credit score and past successful repayment of loans. Some traditional bank loans are overcollateralised when the asset is highly illiquid to make sure that enough cash can be recouped in the event of a loan default. Conversely in most DeFi lending protocols, you need to provide significantly more crypto as collateral than the stable-coins you are borrowing, sometimes as much as 700%.\n\nIt can be hard to understand why someone would ever want to take out a loan worth less than the amount they are putting down as collateral, and whilst there are some valid reasons for this such as delaying a taxable event or increasing leverage on positions through complex financial gymnastics, the vast majority of the world is unwilling or more importantly unable to borrow money in this way. The main reason people borrow money is precisely that they do not have the spare capital available at that time. People take out mortgages to buy houses, or take out loans to start a small restaurant in their hometown. Sometimes your mortgage may even start highly collateralised but later turns undercollateralised if the value of the house goes down, and due to the credit history of the borrower, the loan is still able to remain a _performing loan_. However, the downside of undercollateralisation is that if the loan were to default, the collateral would not be able to cover the principal. In this case, the borrower would step in to cover the difference if they are in fact creditworthy and have some reputational skin in the game. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/17b662fe-a9af-4b5c-afda-aeb07b88e131.png?height=845&width=2138)\n\nTo cater properly to these kinds of users it is important that DeFi eventually gets to a point where loans can be undercollateralised in some way. The difficulty is that DeFi is by its very nature anonymous and trustless, which means that the concept of social proof and credit scores becomes very difficult to handle. A potential solution could be a quasi-anonymous loan passport solution in which the user is anonymous on one dimension but not on another, i.e. their wallet address is public, but the owner of the wallet is not. One could, in theory, understand someone's creditworthiness through their past loans/wallet history, which is of course publicly visible on Web3 or even decrease the user's collateral requirement for their next loan by a certain percentage every time they repay successfully. Another alternative is allowing user loans to be backed/secured by other individuals they know in real life that trust the borrower enough to guarantee their loan and [delegate their credit](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/credit-delegation). Perhaps we could even see some CeFi institutions step in to perform credit checks on DeFi users on a per address basis. This solution would, of course, introduce some centralisation as it would involve real-identity based KYC, but may be a necessary interim solution for users that prioritise a low collateral ratio over absolute anonymity as lending protocols like AAVE could eventually introduce pools of loans where a trusted third party has verified creditworthiness in advance. \n\nThere are already some great projects being built in this space like [teller.finance](https://www.teller.finance/) which is taking a similar approach by connecting to your bank account through [Plaid](https://plaid.com/). Although we are still a while away from a foolproof creditworthiness checker solution in DeFi there are many different approaches one can take and I believe a combination of these approaches will play a large part in solving the issue of collateralisation in the quest for widespread adoption.\n\n#### Understability\n\nThe final hurdle that, depending on how you look at things could be the hardest or easiest of these to solve, is the difficulty around understandability and education. This hurdle may ultimately solve itself if the first two issues are solved and DeFi starts to resemble the way in which users are used to dealing with and thinking about finances. However, it is still important to acknowledge that for non-technical people, the DeFi space can be very opaque and consequently more difficult to trust.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/46fc773f-114b-42c0-b1db-eade3492e306.png?height=697&width=2015)\n\nFiat money and the way centralised traditional financial systems work is deeply ingrained in our culture and is a little easier to properly comprehend because many parts of the system rely on trust and simple written agreements which come together to form financial systems. Understanding the way these systems work in DeFi is a lot less straightforward. While in TradFi it is relatively straightforward to explain the basics of how a bank works, in that one can deposit money, and in return the bank lends that money out and pays interest for that privilege. There are very few parts of that process that are opaque because, ultimately, it just involves numbers moving from one spreadsheet to another.\n\nThe difference with DeFi is that you first have to feel comfortable with the concept of decentralisation, anonymity, trustless systems, distributed ledgers, and then you have to try and explain how all of this functions automatically through smart-contracts. There are many parts of DeFi that have to be hand-waved away and perhaps this could become a hindrance to trust. \n\nOne could also, of course, argue that many people implicitly trust the banking system because enough other trusted people do and not because they understand every part of the process. The same could eventually be true when enough knowledgeable people trust DeFi and understand a good enough percentage of the current information gaps. \n\nThere are some great resources out there like [Finematics](https://finematics.com/) and [Bankless](https://banklesshq.com/) doing amazing things in the education space and teaching newcomers about all things DeFi. I think this will be crucial in making sure people are comfortable enough with the technology to use it, especially when currently decentralisation slightly goes against the grain and users may be met with scepticism from friends and family. \n\n\n\nOverall the space is going in all the right directions. It will take a while for these ideas to materialise fully, but this is the part that interests me the most about the DeFi space. There is so much mind-blowing R&D going on every day, and people are experimenting, taking risks and breaking boundaries. Therefore, I'm very passionate about making sure as many people as possible have access to these tools and can take part in the revolution. Understanding the pieces of the puzzle left to fill will become more and more important as more protocols are built out and refined.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this piece 😊 It's a topic that has been on my mind for the past couple of months and I really enjoyed laying out and structuring my thoughts on the matter. \n\nIf you enjoyed the piece and are interested in receiving more of my content or keeping up to date with anything else I get up to a follow on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/coconidodev) would be great... or if you're more of an email person that works too - subscribe to my infrequent mailing newsletter via the link below.", "timestamp": 1623797011, "digest": "klQF-dVD9TOVI288YuTObvBVY5_GsrmBGDunRoWpYt8", "contributor": "0xcde3725B25D6d9bC78CF0941cC15Fd9710c764b9"}

This is in large part due to the power of true and native [composability](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-true-power-of-defi-composability-14fe8355e0d0#:~:text=Composability%2C%20in%20DeFi%2C%20is%20the,and%20therefore%20each%20other's%20utility.).

We are still a while away from widespread adoption of DeFi, and as many people often say, \"we are still early\". [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), the most popular chrome extension based wallet used to interact with DeFi, only recently reached 5 million monthly active users. Mainstream adoption too soon would potentially come at the wrong time for DeFi because many of the applications would not be ready to properly support the extreme volume, but I have had a lot of time to think about this problem lately and have come to some conclusions about what I think needs to happen in the space before it is fully ready.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/76a440fa-1ae5-443a-97fd-356ebd1a0f25.png?height=848&width=2152)\n\nI call these factors **the Three \"U\"s of DeFi Ubiquity**.\n\n#### Usability\n\nThe first, and arguably most important of these hurdles to ubiquity, is usability. Many of the most successful DeFi protocols are advanced, regularly audited and professionally run but have user interfaces that are unapproachable to all but the most sophisticated investors. In reality, the service they are offering is an enabler for the democratisation of many financial instruments previously unavailable to most investors, and a lot of this innovation is going unnoticed due to complex UX. \n\nThe key to this issue is going to be knowing which parts of the UI to hide, and which to display prominently. [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) is one of the market leaders in keeping its UI simple yet powerful. Still, there will eventually be a divergence of the consumer level interfaces and pro-level interfaces using the same backend, a bit like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) vs [Coinbase **Pro**](https://pro.coinbase.com) to really drive this point home. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) does not focus greatly on UI refinement at the moment, but it will take a beginner-friendly browser wallet that has a good fiat on-ramp and perhaps doesn't even refer to itself as a wallet but more as a [key to Web3](https://rainbow.me) to really help push DApps into the mainstream.\n\nIncreasingly we will start to see startups cropping up worldwide in various industries focusing on leveraging DeFi technologies to verticalise and fine-tune the experience for different audiences with different financial preferences. The technology behind many of the most popular DeFi protocols is fine-tuned and optimised for scale, performance and reliability, so there is a wide-open opportunity for startups to come into specific geographies such as developing economies, where debt financing for small businesses is harder to come by, and build a straightforward front end. This front end could then automatically tap into the sea of open-source protocols and liquidity that is readily available. It could then focus on making it accessible to non-crypto-native audiences with seamless on-ramps for Fiat which, in the future, could allow someone in Venezuela to take out a loan using stablecoins on [AAVE](http://aave.com/) using an [L2 solution like Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) without ever noticing that they have done all of this on a trustless and decentralised back end.\n\nIdeally, customers would eventually be aware of the fact that they are interacting with DeFi, but in order to reach a truly mainstream audience, there will be a transitionary period where perhaps these front ends do not lean too heavily into the crypto angle. This movement comes straight out of the playbook of new Fintech startups like [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) and [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/) that have spent the past decade taking complex financial systems, reducing their complexity and making them accessible to retail investors. These startups often build on top of TradFi and reduce friction for retail users by bending the rules or by [bundling transactions together](https://www.freetrade.io). DeFi could use the same approach and reduce friction even further. It is unlikely that this simplified DeFi front end innovation will come from the existing Fintech incumbents because the way they are used to working is so different to the way DeFi works. TradFi Fintech startups are used to pushing up against and fighting the traditional systems to try and squeeze them into a user experience that is pleasant to use.

[Metamask](https://metamask.io/) does not focus greatly on UI refinement at the moment, but it will take a beginner-friendly browser wallet that has a good fiat on-ramp and perhaps doesn't even refer to itself as a wallet but more as a [key to Web3](https://rainbow.me) to really help push DApps into the mainstream.\n\nIncreasingly we will start to see startups cropping up worldwide in various industries focusing on leveraging DeFi technologies to verticalise and fine-tune the experience for different audiences with different financial preferences. The technology behind many of the most popular DeFi protocols is fine-tuned and optimised for scale, performance and reliability, so there is a wide-open opportunity for startups to come into specific geographies such as developing economies, where debt financing for small businesses is harder to come by, and build a straightforward front end. This front end could then automatically tap into the sea of open-source protocols and liquidity that is readily available. It could then focus on making it accessible to non-crypto-native audiences with seamless on-ramps for Fiat which, in the future, could allow someone in Venezuela to take out a loan using stablecoins on [AAVE](http://aave.com/) using an [L2 solution like Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) without ever noticing that they have done all of this on a trustless and decentralised back end.\n\nIdeally, customers would eventually be aware of the fact that they are interacting with DeFi, but in order to reach a truly mainstream audience, there will be a transitionary period where perhaps these front ends do not lean too heavily into the crypto angle. This movement comes straight out of the playbook of new Fintech startups like [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) and [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/) that have spent the past decade taking complex financial systems, reducing their complexity and making them accessible to retail investors. These startups often build on top of TradFi and reduce friction for retail users by bending the rules or by [bundling transactions together](https://www.freetrade.io). DeFi could use the same approach and reduce friction even further. It is unlikely that this simplified DeFi front end innovation will come from the existing Fintech incumbents because the way they are used to working is so different to the way DeFi works. TradFi Fintech startups are used to pushing up against and fighting the traditional systems to try and squeeze them into a user experience that is pleasant to use. The DeFi space is flexible by design so the approach taken by these verticalised DeFi gateways will be simple, and even encouraged by the protocols themselves, contrary to the struggles faced by TradFi Fintech startups. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/619cb9ed-b108-46e9-af75-3b211568bb06.png?height=806&width=1825)\n\nWhile there will be many independent startups fulfilling this function and maybe even getting funded through the protocols' own grants DAOs, many of these usability improvements will also come from the protocols' own core teams, especially on the institutional side. TradFi tends to prefer interacting directly with the people that built the technology they are going to be leveraging. [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) has actually started experimenting with [permissioned pools for institutional investors](https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-lending-platform-aave-reveals-private-pool-for-institutions) because institutional investors previously found it tough to use the protocol due to lack of [KYC and AML](https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/kyc-aml-know-your-customer-vs-anti-money-laundering/) compliance, and this has allowed banks and other institutional clients using [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) to know that the other parties in the network are compliant and vetted not to be on an [OFAC sanctions list](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information). This is just another example of DeFi slightly adapting to TradFi without compromising on their core principles as an almost intermediate stage to mainstream adoption. Whether that be through making it feel like Fiat through stable-coins, or increasing KYC for institutions to help them to feel more at ease about the protocols they are transacting with, these measures all go a long way towards lowering hurdles to mass adoption. Conversely, we may even slowly start to see the key protocols start to phase out their consumer-focused front ends and instead outsource that part of their business out to third party startups building on top of their protocols, all whilst focusing primarily on the back end and core functionality.\n\nThe runway is wide open, and the tech is ready. These protocols exist and are being built and tested by thousands of users every day. The best part is that anyone can come in and make them more useful to any specific demographic. Look no further than projects like [Ribbon](https://www.ribbon.finance) or even some of the high-quality DeFi aggregators like [Zerion](https://zerion.io/) or [Zapper](https://zapper.fi/) to see this in action. [Ribbon](htts://www.ribbon.finance) has made some sophisticated covered call strategies available to anyone with a [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io/) by building directly on [Opyn's](https://www.opyn.co/) cash-settled ETH options protocol, all while making it feel as simple as an, admittedly high-risk, savings account to the end-user.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0ec888-d3db-4856-af1d-48280478715d.png?height=851&width=2325)\n\n#### Undercolateralisation \n\nThe second hurdle is the issue of overcolateralisation in DeFi lending protocols. When you put the whole DeFi stack together, what you are left with is essentially a fully decentralised crypto bank that runs itself in the most traditional sense of the word. DeFi, just like a bank, allows you to convert between currencies, deposit money and receive interest in return for providing liquidity to the bank to then allow them to loan it back out. On the other side of the equation, anyone can then go to the bank, take out a loan and then pay it back at a rate most suited to their risk profile and time horizon. In TradFi some loans are unsecured, but many are secured in that they have some form of collateral backing the loan. If you fail to pay back said loan, the traditional bank has the legal authority to repossess that asset and liquidate it in exchange for cash. The percentage of the total loan required as collateral often depends on a credit score and past successful repayment of loans. Some traditional bank loans are overcollateralised when the asset is highly illiquid to make sure that enough cash can be recouped in the event of a loan default. Conversely in most DeFi lending protocols, you need to provide significantly more crypto as collateral than the stable-coins you are borrowing, sometimes as much as 700%.\n\nIt can be hard to understand why someone would ever want to take out a loan worth less than the amount they are putting down as collateral, and whilst there are some valid reasons for this such as delaying a taxable event or increasing leverage on positions through complex financial gymnastics, the vast majority of the world is unwilling or more importantly unable to borrow money in this way. The main reason people borrow money is precisely that they do not have the spare capital available at that time. People take out mortgages to buy houses, or take out loans to start a small restaurant in their hometown. Sometimes your mortgage may even start highly collateralised but later turns undercollateralised if the value of the house goes down, and due to the credit history of the borrower, the loan is still able to remain a _performing loan_. However, the downside of undercollateralisation is that if the loan were to default, the collateral would not be able to cover the principal. In this case, the borrower would step in to cover the difference if they are in fact creditworthy and have some reputational skin in the game. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/17b662fe-a9af-4b5c-afda-aeb07b88e131.png?height=845&width=2138)\n\nTo cater properly to these kinds of users it is important that DeFi eventually gets to a point where loans can be undercollateralised in some way. The difficulty is that DeFi is by its very nature anonymous and trustless, which means that the concept of social proof and credit scores becomes very difficult to handle. A potential solution could be a quasi-anonymous loan passport solution in which the user is anonymous on one dimension but not on another, i.e. their wallet address is public, but the owner of the wallet is not. One could, in theory, understand someone's creditworthiness through their past loans/wallet history, which is of course publicly visible on Web3 or even decrease the user's collateral requirement for their next loan by a certain percentage every time they repay successfully. Another alternative is allowing user loans to be backed/secured by other individuals they know in real life that trust the borrower enough to guarantee their loan and [delegate their credit](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/credit-delegation). Perhaps we could even see some CeFi institutions step in to perform credit checks on DeFi users on a per address basis. This solution would, of course, introduce some centralisation as it would involve real-identity based KYC, but may be a necessary interim solution for users that prioritise a low collateral ratio over absolute anonymity as lending protocols could eventually introduce pools of loans where a trusted third party has verified creditworthiness in advance. This could be done in a way that does not necessarily reveal the identity of the wallet-holder using the power of [Zero-Knowledge proofs](https://www.wired.com/story/zero-knowledge-proofs/), with which creditworthiness could be confirmed on a per wallet-address basis.\n\nThere are already some great projects being built in this space like [teller.finance](https://www.teller.finance/) which is taking a similar approach by connecting to your bank account through [Plaid](https://plaid.com/). Although we are still a while away from a foolproof creditworthiness checker solution in DeFi there are many different approaches one can take and I believe a combination of these approaches will play a large part in solving the issue of collateralisation in the quest for widespread adoption.\n\n#### Understability\n\nThe final hurdle that, depending on how you look at things could be the hardest or easiest of these to solve, is the difficulty around understandability and education. This hurdle may ultimately solve itself if the first two issues are solved and DeFi starts to resemble the way in which users are used to dealing with and thinking about finances. However, it is still important to acknowledge that for non-technical people, the DeFi space can be very opaque and consequently more difficult to trust.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/46fc773f-114b-42c0-b1db-eade3492e306.png?height=697&width=2015)\n\nFiat money and the way centralised traditional financial systems work is deeply ingrained in our culture and is a little easier to properly comprehend because many parts of the system rely on trust and simple written agreements which come together to form financial systems. Understanding the way these systems work in DeFi is a lot less straightforward. While in TradFi it is relatively straightforward to explain the basics of how a bank works, in that one can deposit money, and in return the bank lends that money out and pays interest for that privilege. There are very few parts of that process that are opaque because, ultimately, it just involves numbers moving from one spreadsheet to another.\n\nThe difference with DeFi is that you first have to feel comfortable with the concept of decentralisation, anonymity, trustless systems, distributed ledgers, and then you have to try and explain how all of this functions automatically through smart-contracts. There are many parts of DeFi that have to be hand-waved away and perhaps this could become a hindrance to trust. \n\nOne could also, of course, argue that many people implicitly trust the banking system because enough other trusted people do and not because they understand every part of the process. The same could eventually be true when enough knowledgeable people trust DeFi and understand a good enough percentage of the current information gaps. \n\nThere are some great resources out there like [Finematics](https://finematics.com/) and [Bankless](https://banklesshq.com/) doing amazing things in the education space and teaching newcomers about all things DeFi. I think this will be crucial in making sure people are comfortable enough with the technology to use it, especially when currently decentralisation slightly goes against the grain and users may be met with scepticism from friends and family. \n\n\n\nOverall the space is going in all the right directions. It will take a while for these ideas to materialise fully, but this is the part that interests me the most about the DeFi space. There is so much mind-blowing R&D going on every day, and people are experimenting, taking risks and breaking boundaries. Therefore, I'm very passionate about making sure as many people as possible have access to these tools and can take part in the revolution. Understanding the pieces of the puzzle left to fill will become more and more important as more protocols are built out and refined.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this piece 😊 It's a topic that has been on my mind for the past couple of months and I really enjoyed laying out and structuring my thoughts on the matter. \n\nIf you enjoyed the piece and are interested in receiving more of my content or keeping up to date with anything else I get up to a follow on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/coconidodev) would be great... or if you're more of an email person that works too - subscribe to my infrequent mailing newsletter via the link below.", "timestamp": 1623797915, "digest": "klQF-dVD9TOVI288YuTObvBVY5_GsrmBGDunRoWpYt8", "contributor": "0xcde3725B25D6d9bC78CF0941cC15Fd9710c764b9"}
{"id": "j5Qx3RsQsEG84X82gc0Gf6MT0RzyVgvWxokB-gT_MVQ", "title": "How Identity Emerges in Crypto Networks", "body": "Part of what makes us human is we care about our identities. We cultivate identity, consciously or subconsciously, to make us feel good about ourselves, to give us status. \n\nToday, with 75% of young people spending almost all of their time online, a portion of our identity construction has moved to the social web, resulting in modern-era digital identities that are independent of nation states.\n\nSimilarly to how state-issued identities allowed citizens to work and live in urban environments, these corporation-issued web identities have allowed users to log in and use online services - such as media streaming via YouTube, or mobile payments via Venmo.\n\nBut the centralization inherent in the storage and control of these identities presents numerous challenges, including exponential security risks, and an artificial and reductive social identity siloed in corporate platforms.\n\nIn a separate vein of the internet, the decentralization of value in the form of blockchain-based digital assets - including stablecoins, community tokens, and NFT artworks - have exploded in popularity. \n\nThe blockchain technology underlying this movement has mainly been used for public financial accounting of these assets; as peer-to-peer \"ledgers\" that enable financial transactions without an intermediary. Its primary strengths are censorship resistance and guaranteed execution.\n\nBut a public ledger also implies an accessible, auditable, temporally ordered record of interactions among users - including interactions such as purchasing art, or lending currency. Analysis of the contents of these ledgers invites narrative generation and births a new crypto-economic sociology. Identity, understood as *what is known* about us by others, can be represented and explored through information stored on blockchains. \n\nI hold that the relevant scholarly disciplines guide us towards a conception of individuality that is represented well on blockchains, and that blockchains are already expanding, formalizing, and protecting our identities in a socially progressive way.\n\nI explain how on-chain \"intersectional identity\" can be constructed from token ownership networks that reveal group affiliation, and how to view NFTs as cultural objects with shared significance.\n\nI leave out the fact that many systemic problems observed in social media, including [political polarization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bu5l9HREZE), security threats, and other malicious personal attacks, may be mitigated by the increased use of pseudonymous digital identities provided by default on these networks. I also avoid specific implementations for on-chain identity.\n\nFinally, I am not a proponent of \"identity protocols\", but as this post suggests, I view identity as an emergent property of interconnected crypto networks and the activity on them.\n\n## **Intersectional Identity**\n\nThe concept of individuality as the intersection of a person's group affiliations and interests [dates to the beginnings of social science](https://research.bangor.ac.uk/portal/files/13878843/2016_Intersectional_individuality.pdf), when it was formulated by German-Jewish philosopher and psychologist, Moritz Lazarus, and carried on by intellectual heirs such as Georg Simmel and Charles Cooley.\n\nThese early writers argued that modernity was characterized by a more diversified life; that the mind of a person has greater variety of interests, affiliation, and personal projects than ever before. They imagined these affiliations and interests as a system of coordinates, with each additional group determining individuality more exactly.\n\n> \"A man may be regarded as the point of intersection of an indefinite number of circles representing social groups\"\n- Cooley, Human Nature and the Social Order (1922)\n\nCooley specifically [anticipated](https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Cooley/Cooley_1902/Cooley_1902e.html) that expanding individuality is connected with the \"growth of communication\". The blossoming of global communication networks on the internet has borne this out and given interested researchers in every field of study new tools for understanding what it is to be a social animal in a modern world:\n\n> ...beyond the fact that it is so immediately important in all of our lives, [the science of networks] cuts across fields: making sense of human networks draws on core concepts and studies from sociology, economics, math, physics, computer science, and anthropology.\n\n- Matthew Jackson, The Human Network (p. 10)\n\nIntersectional identity is a robust way to operationalize and understand identity, and the proliferation of digital networks has accelerated multidisciplinary research on this topic. As we will see, crypto network analysis deepens this field immensely, and opens it to more accessible and accurate study.\n\n### Problems with this View\n\nFor most of us, the freedom to create intersectional individuality has been achieved through progressive social movements. For example, first and second wave feminism in the United States expanded women's interests and affiliations through ownership of property, and integration with political and workplace groups. Other examples would include the Black Consciousness Movement in South Africa, and the Gay Rights Movement globally.\n\nLooking through an optimistic lens, modernity is a progressive march towards inclusivity, which implies more group affiliation - a broader social life - and hence more individuality. Glen Weyl and Zoë Hitzig (2018) [give a colorful example](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3306738) of this, in what they consider to be a fully self-actualized individual in a liberal society:\n\n> One [example] is the gay nephew of the former ultra-orthodox chief rabbi of State of Israel. He is deeply steeped in nearly ever Jewish theological tradition and is ordained as a conservative rabbi, but runs a “God-optional” shul and was thrown out of the conservative rabbinate for marrying a Jew to a non-Jew. He knows and incorporates into his sermons more social theory and sociology than most rabbis, yet his shul is driven primarily by the contributions of a wide range of artists who draw on ancient Jewish traditions from all over the world.\n\nBut when considered holistically, the increasing multiplicity of our identities has benefited those belonging to some affiliations while, on a relative basis, been exponentially detrimental to others.\n\nThe [dominant use of the term \"intersectionality\"](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142) in social science today (starting with [Crenshaw, 1992](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1229039)), has built a framework for understanding of how oppression, derived from the combination of our social identities, is not merely additive, but at the least multiplicative:\n\n> How one form of oppression is experienced is influenced by and influences how another form is experienced. An additive analysis treats the oppression of a Black woman in a society that is racist as well as sexist as if it were a further burden when, in fact, it is a different burden ... sexism and racism must be seen as interlocking, and not as piled upon each other \n- [Spelman 1988](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/204131/inessential-woman-by-elizabeth-v-spelman/)\n\n> The term intersectionality references the critical insight that race, class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, nation, ability, and age operate not as unitary, mutually exclusive entities, but as reciprocally constructing phenomena that in turn shape complex social inequalities.\n- [Collins, 2015](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142)\n\nThese \"reciprocally constructing phenomena\" that may empower one person with increasing self-actualization, burden others with exponentially debilitating oppression. The fact that this extends to digital life can be deduced *a priori*, but examples are easy to generate: women are *more* targeted online than in real life, because of reduced friction to do so. Hate-speech is easier to propagate due to the algorithmically-amplified virality of content from polarized online groups.\n\nWhile we don't have long-term evidence for the efficacy of crypto networks as a tool for social liberation yet, crypto networks are unique in that they promise participants a highly functional \"persistent pseudonymity\" that has protective functions. An account on these networks do not necessarily reveal a person's nominal offline identity, but also allows its holder to participate in economic activity and exhibit individuality (e.g. group affiliation and taste), while hiding any unbidden or personal attributes likely to lead to oppression (e.g. nationality, race, gender, sex, etc).\n\n![Renée Cox, Chillin' with Liberty displays a vibrant visual mix of identities, from that of the painful distant-historical, to the brave and forward-looking, and from the sexual to the militant.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d10d9a15-5c05-4020-be8f-bf0259c529f4.jpeg?height=857&width=600)\n\n## NFTs as Cultural Objects with Socio-Economic Networks\n\n> Minting a token is an enactment of authenticity, an ontological shift in the history of representation.\n\n- A line from [A Feminist Manifesta of the Blockchain](https://hyperallergic.com/639180/a-feminist-manifesta-of-the-blockchain/) by Claudia Hart\n\nTechnological innovation allow artists to create objects that produce new meanings, social relations, and reputations within a field. Minting an NFT simultaneously creates art and its historical record, which allows us to explore these relations in a new way.\n\n### Technology and Economic Networks in the Construction of Identity\n\nIn *Beethoven and the Construction of Genius,* Tia Nora explains how the invention of the pianoforte was a determinant of Beethoven's success in his early days as a composer; the new sounds evoking a greater range of emotional responses in listeners. But DeNora also examined the social and economic networks that supported Beethoven in Vienna, providing insight into the origins of his identity as the genius we regard him to be today:\n\n> [DeNora] examines more closely than anyone else just which aristocrats supported Beethoven, where they were in the complex Austrian hierarchy, why they backed him, and how this affected aesthetic perceptions. Her study provides substantial insight into the interworking between musical creation and production and the social forces that shape them... \n- [Broyles (1995)](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/161449671.pdf)\n\nNFTs are a technology that allow artists, patrons, and collectors to express and secure ownership of digital goods on a public ledger, and in doing so reveals preferences among and within socio-economic networks. This grants us an unprecedented view into the cultural norms of digital communities. For example, [Charlotte Kent (2021)](https://hyperallergic.com/652667/how-women-artists-have-been-marginalized-in-the-blockchain-discourse/) implicitly alludes to *generalized social exchange* occurring within communities of NFT artists:\n\n> “One notable feature of artists using blockchain is their interest in buying art with the funds they receive...This community-oriented attitude is reminiscent of early feminist practices”\n\nNFTs also allow us to express value for community-oriented attitudes and collective narratives in a new way. An excellent example of is the sale of the NFT “Dreaming at Dusk” (2021), created by Itzel Yard ([ixshells](https://foundation.app/@ixshells)), for 500 ETH (~two million dollars at the time of auction, May 14). The NFT supports the Tor Project, which describes its mission as:\n\n> To advance human rights and freedoms by creating and deploying free and open source anonymity and privacy technologies, supporting their unrestricted availability and use, and furthering their scientific and popular understanding.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/35855)\n\nDreaming at Dusk was collected by a on-chain organization called PleasrDAO. We therefore have a metric that hypothetically assigns a cultural attitude to the PleasrDAO community - according to those values inherent in the Tor Project: human rights through open-source privacy technology. This would extend for any account that bid on the audition for this work, all publicly viewable on-chain. \n\nThe preference for art, expressed through bidding and collecting NFTs, can be a map for digital identity - for a community as well as an individual.\n\n### DAOs as Token-Driven Culture\n\nCulture can measured by embedded \"collective narratives\", expressed in a shared language (*schemas*) and knitted together in a consistent manner. These can produce moral norms (beliefs, attitudes, and values) that inform behavior. \n\n> People construct social reality via the development, transmission, and institutionalization of shared patterns of thinking across generations.\n\n- Measuring Culture (2020), p. 23\n\nShorn, Lotti & Hart (2019) articulate how blockchains enable the organic development of organizations that form shared consensus - conceived as a \"headless brand*\"*, in their iconic article, [Headless Brands](https://otherinter.net/web3/headless-brands/):\n\n> While brands have traditionally been planned and designed directly by corporations, the rise of networked media has challenged the coherence of centrally-managed brand identities. New blockchain-based decentralized organizations take this a step further by giving users financial incentive to spread brand narratives of their own...In this way, a brand operates as a consensus system, facilitating a consistent set of beliefs across people.\n\nBeyond brands, social communities in general are beginning to proliferate around tokens. Friends with Benefits is one such example, whereby the access to the community and its productive capacity is gated by ownership of the token, and holders of the token are financially incentivized to increase its value. Members are interdependent within the community, and work to make it better without any formal organizational hierarchy - bound only by their values:\n\n> Friends with Benefits started as a private Discord server populated by our favorite thinkers and has since evolved into a global community bound together by shared values, shared incentives ($FWB) and shared IRL + URL experiences\n\n- [Evolution of the FWB DAO](https://zhang.mirror.xyz/9sRa2kNDUpkWoQkWw67bJ8PczFyTSX8fotf7JOddxew) - Alex Zhang (2021)\n\nBlockchains allow for people to play new kinds of coordination games, empowered by shared narratives and enacted by a decentralized organization of users. The classic example of a DAO is Bitcoin, which incentivizes millions of people to add labor to the project (in the form of marketing, research, or software development), without formally employing a single person. Although DAOs might have a core development team, or individuals who can influence the DAO's participants, there is no executive board with special powers.\n\nAs the number of people \"working for\" these DAOs expands, it takes on grander proportions, as articulated in [DAOs, Democracy and Governance](http://merkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf), 2016, by Ralph C. Merkle:\n\n> Modern research into “the wisdom of crowds” provides new insights into how to combine the expertise of all participants without handing over control to “experts”. Combined with research on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), this allows us to design a new form of democracy which is more stable, less prone to erratic behavior, better able to meet the needs of its citizens, and which better uses the expertise of all its citizens to make high-quality decisions. We call this new form of democracy a DAO Democracy.\n\nTaken to its most grand proportion, is Balaji's idea of starting a \"Crypto Civilization\":\n\n[https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1269178671086006273?s=20](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1269178671086006273?s=20)\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis post begins to explain how individual identity, viewed as the intersection of our social affiliations and tastes, is an emergent property of blockchain interactions. The richness of our on-chain identities increases as more people and content move onto these networks.\n\nWhile state-issued *formal identities* (e.g. SSN number) and corporation-issued informal identities (e.g. a Facebook login) entail severe security risks through centralization and a high decree of artificiality, decentralized identities promise persistent pseudonymity, while enabling economic cooperation and a greater expression of individuality through the collection of digital cultural objects and participation in DAOs. \n\nThis is a field in its infancy, but it clear that there is potential for crossover among the fields of computer science, network analysis, economic sociology, and many others, in the understanding of our on-chain identities.\n\nIf the use of blockchains continue to proliferate as they have so far, this may become one of the most meaningful fields of study in human history.", "timestamp": 1623798012, "digest": "17-QuzdJJ0n-WGtuFiSXpH13-F3XCBgiPYCRtKANwc8", "contributor": "0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026"}

The space has you covered for anything ranging from [peer-to-protocol lending protocols](https://aave.com/) to [insurance policies that protect users from loss of funds due to protocol bugs](https://nexusmutual.io/). Derivative protocols like [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) have you covered for any investments in non ETH-based assets, and you need look no further than [Opyn](https://www.opyn.co/) for all your cash-settled options trading needs. \n\nThe space is quickly starting to resemble a fully functional financial system, with all the applications and systems needed for standard retail investor transactions established and regularly audited, but also the most niche structured products thriving and innovating further with every passing day. \n\nHowever, the most striking difference is that DeFi is trying to do what TradFi (Traditional Finance) did over the past 2,000 years in just a couple of years. This is in large part due to the power of true and native [composability](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-true-power-of-defi-composability-14fe8355e0d0#:~:text=Composability%2C%20in%20DeFi%2C%20is%20the,and%20therefore%20each%20other's%20utility.).

We are still a while away from widespread adoption of DeFi, and as many people often say, \"we are still early\". [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), the most popular chrome extension based wallet used to interact with DeFi, only recently reached 5 million monthly active users. Mainstream adoption too soon would potentially come at the wrong time for DeFi because many of the applications would not be ready to properly support the extreme volume, but I have had a lot of time to think about this problem lately and have come to some conclusions about what I think needs to happen in the space before it is fully ready.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/76a440fa-1ae5-443a-97fd-356ebd1a0f25.png?height=848&width=2152)\n\nI call these factors **the Three \"U\"s of DeFi Ubiquity**.\n\n#### Usability\n\nThe first, and arguably most important of these hurdles to ubiquity, is usability. Many of the most successful DeFi protocols are advanced, regularly audited and professionally run but have user interfaces that are unapproachable to all but the most sophisticated investors. In reality, the service they are offering is an enabler for the democratisation of many financial instruments previously unavailable to most investors, and a lot of this innovation is going unnoticed due to complex UX. \n\nThe key to this issue is going to be knowing which parts of the UI to hide, and which to display prominently. [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) is one of the market leaders in keeping its UI simple yet powerful. Still, there will eventually be a divergence of the consumer level interfaces and pro-level interfaces using the same backend, a bit like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) vs [Coinbase **Pro**](https://pro.coinbase.com) to really drive this point home. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) does not focus greatly on UI refinement at the moment, but it will take a beginner-friendly browser wallet that has a good fiat on-ramp and perhaps doesn't even refer to itself as a wallet but more as a [key to Web3](https://rainbow.me) to really help push DApps into the mainstream.\n\nIncreasingly we will start to see startups cropping up worldwide in various industries focusing on leveraging DeFi technologies to verticalise and fine-tune the experience for different audiences with different financial preferences. The technology behind many of the most popular DeFi protocols is fine-tuned and optimised for scale, performance and reliability, so there is a wide-open opportunity for startups to come into specific geographies such as developing economies, where debt financing for small businesses is harder to come by, and build a straightforward front end. This front end could then automatically tap into the sea of open-source protocols and liquidity that is readily available. It could then focus on making it accessible to non-crypto-native audiences with seamless on-ramps for Fiat which, in the future, could allow someone in Venezuela to take out a loan using stablecoins on [AAVE](http://aave.com/) using an [L2 solution like Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) without ever noticing that they have done all of this on a trustless and decentralised back end.\n\nIdeally, customers would eventually be aware of the fact that they are interacting with DeFi, but in order to reach a truly mainstream audience, there will be a transitionary period where perhaps these front ends do not lean too heavily into the crypto angle. This movement comes straight out of the playbook of new Fintech startups like [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) and [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/) that have spent the past decade taking complex financial systems, reducing their complexity and making them accessible to retail investors. These startups often build on top of TradFi and reduce friction for retail users by bending the rules or by [bundling transactions together](https://www.freetrade.io). DeFi could use the same approach and reduce friction even further. It is unlikely that this simplified DeFi front end innovation will come from the existing Fintech incumbents because the way they are used to working is so different to the way DeFi works. TradFi Fintech startups are used to pushing up against and fighting the traditional systems to try and squeeze them into a user experience that is pleasant to use. The DeFi space is flexible by design so the approach taken by these verticalised DeFi gateways will be simple, and even encouraged by the protocols themselves, contrary to the struggles faced by TradFi Fintech startups. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/619cb9ed-b108-46e9-af75-3b211568bb06.png?height=806&width=1825)\n\nWhile there will be many independent startups fulfilling this function and maybe even getting funded through the protocols' own grants DAOs, many of these usability improvements will also come from the protocols' own core teams, especially on the institutional side. TradFi tends to prefer interacting directly with the people that built the technology they are going to be leveraging. [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) has actually started experimenting with [permissioned pools for institutional investors](https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-lending-platform-aave-reveals-private-pool-for-institutions) because institutional investors previously found it tough to use the protocol due to lack of [KYC and AML](https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/kyc-aml-know-your-customer-vs-anti-money-laundering/) compliance, and this has allowed banks and other institutional clients using [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) to know that the other parties in the network are compliant and vetted not to be on an [OFAC sanctions list](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information). This is just another example of DeFi slightly adapting to TradFi without compromising on their core principles as an almost intermediate stage to mainstream adoption. Whether that be through making it feel like Fiat through stable-coins, or increasing KYC for institutions to help them to feel more at ease about the protocols they are transacting with, these measures all go a long way towards lowering hurdles to mass adoption. Conversely, we may even slowly start to see the key protocols start to phase out their consumer-focused front ends and instead outsource that part of their business out to third party startups building on top of their protocols, all whilst focusing primarily on the back end and core functionality.\n\nThe runway is wide open, and the tech is ready. These protocols exist and are being built and tested by thousands of users every day. The best part is that anyone can come in and make them more useful to any specific demographic. Look no further than projects like [Ribbon](https://www.ribbon.finance) or even some of the high-quality DeFi aggregators like [Zerion](https://zerion.io/) or [Zapper](https://zapper.fi/) to see this in action. [Ribbon](htts://www.ribbon.finance) has made some sophisticated covered call strategies available to anyone with a [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io/) by building directly on [Opyn's](https://www.opyn.co/) cash-settled ETH options protocol, all while making it feel as simple as an, admittedly high-risk, savings account to the end-user.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0ec888-d3db-4856-af1d-48280478715d.png?height=851&width=2325)\n\n#### Undercolateralisation \n\nThe second hurdle is the issue of overcolateralisation in DeFi lending protocols. When you put the whole DeFi stack together, what you are left with is essentially a fully decentralised crypto bank that runs itself in the most traditional sense of the word. DeFi, just like a bank, allows you to convert between currencies, deposit money and receive interest in return for providing liquidity to the bank to then allow them to loan it back out. On the other side of the equation, anyone can then go to the bank, take out a loan and then pay it back at a rate most suited to their risk profile and time horizon. In TradFi some loans are unsecured, but many are secured in that they have some form of collateral backing the loan. If you fail to pay back said loan, the traditional bank has the legal authority to repossess that asset and liquidate it in exchange for cash. The percentage of the total loan required as collateral often depends on a credit score and past successful repayment of loans. Some traditional bank loans are overcollateralised when the asset is highly illiquid to make sure that enough cash can be recouped in the event of a loan default. Conversely in most DeFi lending protocols, you need to provide significantly more crypto as collateral than the stable-coins you are borrowing, sometimes as much as 700%.\n\nIt can be hard to understand why someone would ever want to take out a loan worth less than the amount they are putting down as collateral, and whilst there are some valid reasons for this such as delaying a taxable event or increasing leverage on positions through complex financial gymnastics, the vast majority of the world is unwilling or more importantly unable to borrow money in this way. The main reason people borrow money is precisely that they do not have the spare capital available at that time. People take out mortgages to buy houses, or take out loans to start a small restaurant in their hometown. Sometimes your mortgage may even start highly collateralised but later turns undercollateralised if the value of the house goes down, and due to the credit history of the borrower, the loan is still able to remain a _performing loan_. However, the downside of undercollateralisation is that if the loan were to default, the collateral would not be able to cover the principal. In this case, the borrower would step in to cover the difference if they are in fact creditworthy and have some reputational skin in the game. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/17b662fe-a9af-4b5c-afda-aeb07b88e131.png?height=845&width=2138)\n\nTo cater properly to these kinds of users it is important that DeFi eventually gets to a point where loans can be undercollateralised in some way. The difficulty is that DeFi is by its very nature anonymous and trustless, which means that the concept of social proof and credit scores becomes very difficult to handle. A potential solution could be a quasi-anonymous loan passport solution in which the user is anonymous on one dimension but not on another, i.e. their wallet address is public, but the owner of the wallet is not. One could, in theory, understand someone's creditworthiness through their past loans/wallet history, which is of course publicly visible on Web3 or even decrease the user's collateral requirement for their next loan by a certain percentage every time they repay successfully. Another alternative is allowing user loans to be backed/secured by other individuals they know in real life that trust the borrower enough to guarantee their loan and [delegate their credit](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/credit-delegation). Perhaps we could even see some CeFi institutions step in to perform credit checks on DeFi users on a per address basis. This solution would, of course, introduce some centralisation as it would involve real-identity based KYC, but may be a necessary interim solution for users that prioritise a low collateral ratio over absolute anonymity as lending protocols could eventually introduce pools of loans where a trusted third party has verified creditworthiness in advance. This could be done in a way that does not necessarily reveal the identity of the wallet-holder using the power of [Zero-Knowledge proofs](https://www.wired.com/story/zero-knowledge-proofs/), with which creditworthiness could be confirmed on a per wallet-address basis without conveying any unnecessary extra information about the identity of the holder.\n\nThere are already some great projects being built in this space like [teller.finance](https://www.teller.finance/) which is taking a similar approach by connecting to your bank account through [Plaid](https://plaid.com/). Although we are still a while away from a foolproof creditworthiness checker solution in DeFi there are many different approaches one can take and I believe a combination of these approaches will play a large part in solving the issue of collateralisation in the quest for widespread adoption.\n\n#### Understability\n\nThe final hurdle that, depending on how you look at things could be the hardest or easiest of these to solve, is the difficulty around understandability and education. This hurdle may ultimately solve itself if the first two issues are solved and DeFi starts to resemble the way in which users are used to dealing with and thinking about finances. However, it is still important to acknowledge that for non-technical people, the DeFi space can be very opaque and consequently more difficult to trust.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/46fc773f-114b-42c0-b1db-eade3492e306.png?height=697&width=2015)\n\nFiat money and the way centralised traditional financial systems work is deeply ingrained in our culture and is a little easier to properly comprehend because many parts of the system rely on trust and simple written agreements which come together to form financial systems. Understanding the way these systems work in DeFi is a lot less straightforward. While in TradFi it is relatively straightforward to explain the basics of how a bank works, in that one can deposit money, and in return the bank lends that money out and pays interest for that privilege. There are very few parts of that process that are opaque because, ultimately, it just involves numbers moving from one spreadsheet to another.\n\nThe difference with DeFi is that you first have to feel comfortable with the concept of decentralisation, anonymity, trustless systems, distributed ledgers, and then you have to try and explain how all of this functions automatically through smart-contracts. There are many parts of DeFi that have to be hand-waved away and perhaps this could become a hindrance to trust. \n\nOne could also, of course, argue that many people implicitly trust the banking system because enough other trusted people do and not because they understand every part of the process. The same could eventually be true when enough knowledgeable people trust DeFi and understand a good enough percentage of the current information gaps. \n\nThere are some great resources out there like [Finematics](https://finematics.com/) and [Bankless](https://banklesshq.com/) doing amazing things in the education space and teaching newcomers about all things DeFi. I think this will be crucial in making sure people are comfortable enough with the technology to use it, especially when currently decentralisation slightly goes against the grain and users may be met with scepticism from friends and family. \n\n\n\nOverall the space is going in all the right directions. It will take a while for these ideas to materialise fully, but this is the part that interests me the most about the DeFi space. There is so much mind-blowing R&D going on every day, and people are experimenting, taking risks and breaking boundaries. Therefore, I'm very passionate about making sure as many people as possible have access to these tools and can take part in the revolution. Understanding the pieces of the puzzle left to fill will become more and more important as more protocols are built out and refined.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this piece 😊 It's a topic that has been on my mind for the past couple of months and I really enjoyed laying out and structuring my thoughts on the matter. \n\nIf you enjoyed the piece and are interested in receiving more of my content or keeping up to date with anything else I get up to a follow on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/coconidodev) would be great... or if you're more of an email person that works too - subscribe to my infrequent mailing newsletter via the link below.", "timestamp": 1623797995, "digest": "klQF-dVD9TOVI288YuTObvBVY5_GsrmBGDunRoWpYt8", "contributor": "0xcde3725B25D6d9bC78CF0941cC15Fd9710c764b9"}

The space has you covered for anything ranging from [peer-to-protocol lending protocols](https://aave.com/) to [insurance policies that protect users from loss of funds due to protocol bugs](https://nexusmutual.io/). Derivative protocols like [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) have you covered for any investments in non ETH-based assets, and you need look no further than [Opyn](https://www.opyn.co/) for all your cash-settled options trading needs. \n\nThe space is quickly starting to resemble a fully functional financial system, with all the applications and systems needed for standard retail investor transactions established and regularly audited, but also the most niche structured products thriving and innovating further with every passing day. \n\nHowever, the most striking difference is that DeFi is trying to do what TradFi (Traditional Finance) did over the past 2,000 years in just a couple of years. This is in large part due to the power of true and native [composability](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-true-power-of-defi-composability-14fe8355e0d0#:~:text=Composability%2C%20in%20DeFi%2C%20is%20the,and%20therefore%20each%20other's%20utility.).

{"id": "obSP2jcALPrdXZBz5lm_JAWwHyAeCUo16NugazGiAhU", "title": "The Three \"U\"s of DeFi Ubiquity", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/549eeeb5-1813-412b-95c6-e98fed96906a.jpg?height=1500&width=2500&refresh=true)\n\nDecentralised Finance, DeFi, is thought by many to be the future of the financial services industry and is expected to completely change the way people think about money and the systems and institutions they entrust to look after their money. The space has you covered for anything ranging from [peer-to-protocol lending protocols](https://aave.com/) to [insurance policies that protect users from loss of funds due to protocol bugs](https://nexusmutual.io/). Derivative protocols like [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) have you covered for any investments in non ETH-based assets, and you need look no further than [Opyn](https://www.opyn.co/) for all your cash-settled options trading needs. \n\nThe space is quickly starting to resemble a fully functional financial system, with all the applications and systems needed for standard retail investor transactions established and regularly audited, but also the most niche structured products thriving and innovating further with every passing day. \n\nHowever, the most striking difference is that DeFi is trying to do what TradFi (Traditional Finance) did over the past 2,000 years in just a couple of years. This pace of innovation is in large part aided by the true and native [composability](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-true-power-of-defi-composability-14fe8355e0d0#:~:text=Composability%2C%20in%20DeFi%2C%20is%20the,and%20therefore%20each%20other's%20utility.) of DeFi which allows projects to seamlessly integrate with each other. It will then catch up to a point where it can eventually step over and replace it. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6d974fc1-8031-47f3-9f5b-4bda5509abc9.png?height=700&width=1801)\n\nThe future is bright for DeFi, and the space is always vibrant and full of energy, no matter the state of the overall crypto market. We are still a while away from widespread adoption of DeFi, and as many people often say, \"we are still early\". [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), the most popular chrome extension based wallet used to interact with DeFi, only recently reached 5 million monthly active users. Mainstream adoption too soon would potentially come at the wrong time for DeFi as the applications may not be properly optimised to support the large and sudden influx of users. I have had a lot of time to think about this problem lately and have come to some conclusions about what I believe needs to happen in the space before it is fully ready.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/76a440fa-1ae5-443a-97fd-356ebd1a0f25.png?height=848&width=2152)\n\nI call these factors **the Three \"U\"s of DeFi Ubiquity**.\n\n#### Usability\n\nThe first, and arguably most important of these hurdles to ubiquity, is usability. Many of the most successful DeFi protocols are advanced, regularly audited and professionally run but have user interfaces that are unapproachable to all but the most sophisticated investors. In reality, the service they are offering is an enabler for the democratisation of many financial instruments previously unavailable to most investors. \n\nThe key to this issue is going to be knowing which parts of the UI to hide, and which to display prominently. [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) is one of the market leaders in keeping its UI simple yet powerful. Still, there will eventually be a divergence of the consumer level interfaces and pro-level interfaces using the same backend, a bit like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) vs [Coinbase **Pro**](https://pro.coinbase.com) to really drive this point home. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) does not focus greatly on UI refinement at the moment, but it will take a beginner-friendly browser wallet that has a good fiat on-ramp and perhaps doesn't even refer to itself as a wallet but more as a [key to Web3](https://rainbow.me) to really help push DApps into the mainstream.\n\nIncreasingly we will start to see startups cropping up worldwide in various industries focusing on leveraging DeFi technologies to verticalise and fine-tune the experience for different audiences with different financial preferences. The technology behind many of the most popular DeFi protocols is fine-tuned and optimised for scale, performance and reliability, so there is a wide-open opportunity for startups to come into specific geographies such as developing economies, where debt financing for small businesses is harder to come by, and build a straightforward front end. This front end could then automatically tap into the sea of open-source protocols and liquidity that is readily available. It could then focus on making it accessible to non-crypto-native audiences with seamless on-ramps for Fiat which, in the future, could allow someone in Venezuela to take out a loan using stablecoins on [AAVE](http://aave.com/) using an [L2 solution like Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) without ever noticing that they have done all of this on a trustless and decentralised back end. \n\nIdeally, customers would eventually be aware of the fact that they are interacting with DeFi, but in order to reach a truly mainstream audience there will be a transitionary period where perhaps these front ends do not lean too heavily into the crypto angle. This movement comes straight out of the playbook of new Fintech startups like [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) and [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/) that have spent the past decade taking complex financial systems, reducing their complexity and making them accessible to retail investors. These startups often build on top of TradFi and reduce friction for retail users by bending the rules or by [bundling transactions together](https://www.freetrade.io). DeFi could use the same approach and reduce friction even further. It is unlikely that this simplified DeFi front end innovation will come from the existing Fintech incumbents because the way they are used to working is so different to the way DeFi works. TradFi Fintech startups are used to pushing up against and fighting the traditional systems to try and squeeze them into a user experience that is pleasant to use. The DeFi space is flexible by design so the approach taken by these verticalised DeFi gateways will be simple, and even encouraged by the protocols themselves, contrary to the struggles faced by TradFi Fintech startups. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/619cb9ed-b108-46e9-af75-3b211568bb06.png?height=806&width=1825)\n\nWhile there will be many independent startups fulfilling this function and maybe even getting funded through the protocols' own grants DAOs, many of these usability improvements will also come from the protocols' own core teams, especially on the institutional side. TradFi tends to prefer interacting directly with the people that built the technology they are going to be leveraging. [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) has actually started experimenting with [permissioned pools for institutional investors](https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-lending-platform-aave-reveals-private-pool-for-institutions) because institutional investors previously found it tough to use the protocol due to lack of [KYC and AML](https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/kyc-aml-know-your-customer-vs-anti-money-laundering/) compliance, and this has allowed banks and other institutional clients using [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) to know that the other parties in the network are compliant and vetted not to be on an [OFAC sanctions list](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information). This is just another example of DeFi slightly adapting to TradFi without compromising on their core principles as an almost intermediate stage to mainstream adoption. Whether that be through making it feel like Fiat through stable-coins, or increasing KYC for institutions to help them to feel more at ease about the protocols they are transacting with, these measures all go a long way towards lowering hurdles to mass adoption.\n\nThe runway is wide open, and the tech is ready. These protocols exist and are being built and tested by thousands of users every day. The best part is that anyone can come in and make them more useful to any specific demographic. Look no further than projects like [Ribbon](https://www.ribbon.finance) to see this in action. [Ribbon](htts://www.ribbon.finance) has made some sophisticated covered call strategies available to anyone with a [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io/) by building directly on [Opyn's](https://www.opyn.co/) cash-settled ETH options protocol, all while making it feel as simple as an, admittedly high-risk, savings account to the end-user.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0ec888-d3db-4856-af1d-48280478715d.png?height=851&width=2325)\n\n#### Undercolateralisation \n\nThe second hurdle is the issue of overcolateralisation in DeFi lending protocols. When you put the whole DeFi stack together, what you are left with is essentially a fully decentralised crypto bank that runs itself in the most traditional sense of the word. DeFi, just like a bank, allows you to convert between currencies, deposit money and receive interest in return for providing liquidity to the bank to then allow them to loan it back out. On the other side of the equation, anyone can then go to the bank, take out a loan and then pay it back at a rate most suited to their risk profile and time horizon. In TradFi some loans are unsecured, but many are secured in that they have some form of collateral backing the loan. If you fail to pay back said loan, the traditional bank has the legal authority to repossess that asset and liquidate it in exchange for cash. The percentage of the total loan required as collateral often depends on a credit score and past successful repayment of loans. Some traditional bank loans are overcollateralised when the asset is highly illiquid to make sure that enough cash can be recouped in the event of a loan default. Conversely in most DeFi lending protocols, you need to provide significantly more crypto as collateral than the stable-coins you are borrowing, sometimes as much as 700%.\n\nIt can be hard to understand why someone would ever want to take out a loan worth less than the amount they are putting down as collateral, and whilst there are some valid reasons for this such as delaying a taxable event or increasing leverage on positions through complex financial gymnastics, the vast majority of the world is unwilling or more importantly unable to borrow money in this way. The main reason people borrow money is precisely that they do not have the spare capital available at that time. People take out mortgages to buy houses, or take out loans to start a small restaurant in their hometown. Sometimes your mortgage may even start highly collateralised but later turns undercollateralised if the value of the house goes down, and due to the credit history of the borrower, the loan is still able to remain a _performing loan_. However, the downside of undercollateralisation is that if the loan were to default, the collateral would not be able to cover the principal. In this case, the borrower would step in to cover the difference if they are in fact creditworthy and have some reputational skin in the game. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/17b662fe-a9af-4b5c-afda-aeb07b88e131.png?height=845&width=2138)\n\nTo cater properly to these kinds of users it is important that DeFi eventually gets to a point where loans can be undercollateralised in some way. The difficulty is that DeFi is by its very nature anonymous and trustless, which means that the concept of social proof and credit scores becomes very difficult to handle. A potential solution could be a quasi-anonymous loan passport solution in which the user is anonymous on one dimension but not on another, i.e. their wallet address is public, but the owner of the wallet is not. One could, in theory, understand someone's creditworthiness through their past loans/wallet history, which is of course publicly visible on Web3 or even decrease the user's collateral requirement for their next loan by a certain percentage every time they repay successfully. Another alternative is allowing user loans to be backed/secured by other individuals they know in real life that trust the borrower enough to guarantee their loan and [delegate their credit](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/credit-delegation). Perhaps we could even see some CeFi institutions step in to perform credit checks on DeFi users on a per address basis. This solution would, of course, introduce some centralisation as it would involve real-identity based KYC, but may be a necessary interim solution for users that prioritise a low collateral ratio over absolute anonymity as lending protocols could eventually introduce pools of loans where a trusted third party has verified creditworthiness in advance. \n\nThere are already some great projects being built in this space like [teller.finance](https://www.teller.finance/) which is taking a similar approach by connecting to your bank account through [Plaid](https://plaid.com/). Although we are still a while away from a foolproof creditworthiness checker solution in DeFi there are many different approaches one can take and I believe a combination of these approaches will play a large part in solving the issue of collateralisation in the quest for widespread adoption.\n\n#### Understability\n\nThe final hurdle that, depending on how you look at things could be the hardest or easiest of these to solve, is the difficulty around understandability and education. This hurdle may ultimately solve itself if the first two issues are solved and DeFi starts to resemble the way in which users are used to dealing with and thinking about finances. However, it is still important to acknowledge that for non-technical people, the DeFi space can be very opaque and consequently more difficult to trust.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/46fc773f-114b-42c0-b1db-eade3492e306.png?height=697&width=2015)\n\nFiat money and the way centralised traditional financial systems work is deeply ingrained in our culture and is a little easier to properly comprehend because many parts of the system rely on trust and simple written agreements which come together to form financial systems. Understanding the way these systems work in DeFi is a lot less straightforward. While in TradFi it is relatively straightforward to explain the basics of how a bank works, in that one can deposit money, and in return the bank lends that money out and pays interest for that privilege. There are very few parts of that process that are opaque because, ultimately, it just involves numbers moving from one spreadsheet to another.\n\nThe difference with DeFi is that you first have to feel comfortable with the concept of decentralisation, anonymity, trustless systems, distributed ledgers, and then you have to try and explain how all of this functions automatically through smart-contracts. There are many parts of DeFi that have to be hand-waved away and perhaps this could become a hindrance to trust. \n\nOne could also, of course, argue that many people implicitly trust the banking system because enough other trusted people do and not because they understand every part of the process. The same could eventually be true when enough knowledgeable people trust DeFi and understand a good enough percentage of the current information gaps. \n\nThere are some great resources out there like [Finematics](https://finematics.com/) and [Bankless](https://banklesshq.com/) doing amazing things in the education space and teaching newcomers about all things DeFi. This will be crucial in making sure people are comfortable enough with the technology to use it, especially when currently decentralisation slightly goes against the grain and users may be met with scepticism from friends and family. \n\n\n\nOverall the space is going in all the right directions. It will take a while for these ideas to materialise fully, but this is the part that interests me the most about the DeFi space. There is so much mind-blowing R&D going on every day, and people are experimenting, taking risks and breaking boundaries. Therefore, I'm very passionate about making sure as many people as possible have access to these tools and can take part in the revolution. Understanding the pieces of the puzzle left to fill will become more and more important as more protocols are built out and refined.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this piece 😊 It's a topic that has been on my mind for the past couple of months and I really enjoyed laying out and structuring my thoughts on the matter. \n\nIf you enjoyed the piece and are interested in receiving more of my content or keeping up to date with anything else I get up to a follow on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/coconidodev) would be great... or if you're more of an email person that works too - subscribe to my infrequent mailing newsletter via the link below.", "timestamp": 1623802444, "digest": "klQF-dVD9TOVI288YuTObvBVY5_GsrmBGDunRoWpYt8", "contributor": "0xcde3725B25D6d9bC78CF0941cC15Fd9710c764b9"}
{"id": "lhtEExTv24kXNEAZI4ELAJ-efXqH2vd594WrczHidKc", "title": "How Identity Emerges in Crypto Networks", "body": "Part of what makes us human is we care about our identities. We cultivate identity, consciously or subconsciously, to make us feel good about ourselves, to give us status. \n\nToday, with 75% of young people spending almost all of their time online, a portion of our identity construction has moved to the social web, resulting in modern-era digital identities that are independent of nation states.\n\nSimilarly to how state-issued identities allowed citizens to work and live in urban environments, these corporation-issued web identities have allowed users to log in and use online services - such as media streaming via YouTube, or mobile payments via Venmo.\n\nBut the centralization inherent in the storage and control of these identities presents numerous challenges, including exponential security risks, and an artificial and reductive social identity siloed in corporate platforms.\n\nIn a separate vein of the internet, the decentralization of value in the form of blockchain-based digital assets - including stablecoins, community tokens, and NFT artworks - have exploded in popularity. \n\nThe blockchain technology underlying this movement has mainly been used for public financial accounting of these assets; as peer-to-peer \"ledgers\" that enable financial transactions without an intermediary. Its primary strengths are censorship resistance and guaranteed execution.\n\nBut a public ledger also implies an accessible, auditable, temporally ordered record of interactions among users - including interactions such as purchasing art, or lending currency. Analysis of the contents of these ledgers invites narrative generation and births a new crypto-economic sociology. Identity, understood as *what is known* about us by others, can be represented and explored through information stored on blockchains. \n\nI hold that the relevant scholarly disciplines guide us towards a conception of individuality that is represented well on blockchains, and that blockchains are already expanding, formalizing, and protecting our identities in a socially progressive way.\n\nI explain how on-chain \"intersectional identity\" can be constructed from token ownership networks that reveal group affiliation, and how to view NFTs as cultural objects with shared significance.\n\nI leave out the fact that many systemic problems observed in social media, including [political polarization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bu5l9HREZE), security threats, and other malicious personal attacks, may be mitigated by the increased use of pseudonymous digital identities provided by default on these networks. I also avoid specific implementations for on-chain identity.\n\nFinally, I am not a proponent of \"identity protocols\", but as this post suggests, I view identity as an emergent property of interconnected crypto networks and the activity on them.\n\n## **Intersectional Identity**\n\nThe concept of individuality as the intersection of a person's group affiliations and interests [dates to the beginnings of social science](https://research.bangor.ac.uk/portal/files/13878843/2016_Intersectional_individuality.pdf), when it was formulated by German-Jewish philosopher and psychologist, Moritz Lazarus, and carried on by intellectual heirs such as Georg Simmel and Charles Cooley.\n\nThese early writers argued that modernity was characterized by a more diversified life; that the mind of a person has greater variety of interests, affiliation, and personal projects than ever before. They imagined these affiliations and interests as a system of coordinates, with each additional group determining one's individuality more exactly.\n\n> \"A man may be regarded as the point of intersection of an indefinite number of circles representing social groups\"\n- Cooley, Human Nature and the Social Order (1922)\n\nCooley specifically [anticipated](https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Cooley/Cooley_1902/Cooley_1902e.html) that expanding individuality is connected with the \"growth of communication\". The blossoming of global communication networks on the internet has borne this out and given interested researchers in every field of study new tools for understanding what it is to be a social animal in a modern world:\n\n> ...beyond the fact that it is so immediately important in all of our lives, [the science of networks] cuts across fields: making sense of human networks draws on core concepts and studies from sociology, economics, math, physics, computer science, and anthropology.\n\n- Matthew Jackson, The Human Network (p. 10)\n\nIntersectional identity is a robust way to operationalize and understand identity, and the proliferation of digital networks has accelerated multidisciplinary research on this topic. As we will see, crypto network analysis deepens this field immensely, and opens it to more accessible and accurate study.\n\n### Problems with this View\n\nFor most of us, the freedom to create intersectional individuality has been achieved through progressive social movements. For example, first and second wave feminism in the United States expanded women's interests and affiliations through ownership of property, and integration with political and workplace groups. Other examples would include the Black Consciousness Movement in South Africa, and the Gay Rights Movement globally.\n\nLooking through an optimistic lens, modernity is a progressive march towards inclusivity, which implies more group affiliation - a broader social life - and hence more individuality. Glen Weyl and Zoë Hitzig (2018) [give a colorful example](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3306738) of this, in what they consider to be a fully self-actualized individual in a liberal society:\n\n> One [example] is the gay nephew of the former ultra-orthodox chief rabbi of State of Israel. He is deeply steeped in nearly ever Jewish theological tradition and is ordained as a conservative rabbi, but runs a “God-optional” shul and was thrown out of the conservative rabbinate for marrying a Jew to a non-Jew. He knows and incorporates into his sermons more social theory and sociology than most rabbis, yet his shul is driven primarily by the contributions of a wide range of artists who draw on ancient Jewish traditions from all over the world.\n\nBut when considered holistically, the increasing multiplicity of our identities has benefited those belonging to some affiliations while, on a relative basis, been exponentially detrimental to others.\n\nThe [dominant use of the term \"intersectionality\"](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142) in social science today (starting with [Crenshaw, 1992](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1229039)), has built a framework for understanding of how oppression, derived from the combination of our social identities, is not merely additive:\n\n> How one form of oppression is experienced is influenced by and influences how another form is experienced. An additive analysis treats the oppression of a Black woman in a society that is racist as well as sexist as if it were a further burden when, in fact, it is a different burden ... sexism and racism must be seen as interlocking, and not as piled upon each other \n- [Spelman 1988](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/204131/inessential-woman-by-elizabeth-v-spelman/)\n\n> The term intersectionality references the critical insight that race, class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, nation, ability, and age operate not as unitary, mutually exclusive entities, but as reciprocally constructing phenomena that in turn shape complex social inequalities.\n- [Collins, 2015](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142)\n\nThese \"reciprocally constructing phenomena\" that may empower one person with increasing self-actualization, burden others with exponentially debilitating oppression. The fact that this extends to digital life can be deduced *a priori*, but examples are easy to generate: women are *more* targeted online than in real life, because of reduced friction to do so. Hate-speech is easier to propagate due to the algorithmically-amplified virality of content from polarized online groups.\n\nWhile we don't have long-term evidence for the efficacy of crypto networks as a tool for social liberation yet, crypto networks are unique in that they promise participants a highly functional \"persistent pseudonymity\" that has protective functions. An account on these networks does not necessarily reveal a person's nominal offline identity, but also allows its holder to participate in economic activity and exhibit individuality (e.g. group affiliation and taste), while hiding any unbidden or personal attributes likely to lead to oppression (e.g. nationality, race, gender, sex, etc).\n\n![Renée Cox, Chillin' with Liberty displays a vibrant visual mix of identities, from that of the painful distant-historical, to the brave and forward-looking, and from the sexual to the militant.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d10d9a15-5c05-4020-be8f-bf0259c529f4.jpeg?height=857&width=600)\n\n## NFTs as Cultural Objects with Socio-Economic Networks\n\n> Minting a token is an enactment of authenticity, an ontological shift in the history of representation.\n\n- A line from [A Feminist Manifesta of the Blockchain](https://hyperallergic.com/639180/a-feminist-manifesta-of-the-blockchain/) by Claudia Hart\n\nTechnological innovation allow artists to create objects that produce new meanings, social relations, and reputations within a field. Minting an NFT simultaneously creates art and its historical record, which allows us to explore these relations in a new way.\n\n### Technology and Economic Networks in the Construction of Identity\n\nIn *Beethoven and the Construction of Genius,* Tia Nora explains how the invention of the pianoforte was a determinant of Beethoven's success in his early days as a composer; the new sounds evoking a greater range of emotional responses in listeners. But DeNora also examined the social and economic networks that supported Beethoven in Vienna, providing insight into the origins of his identity as the genius we regard him to be today:\n\n> [DeNora] examines more closely than anyone else just which aristocrats supported Beethoven, where they were in the complex Austrian hierarchy, why they backed him, and how this affected aesthetic perceptions. Her study provides substantial insight into the interworking between musical creation and production and the social forces that shape them... \n- [Broyles (1995)](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/161449671.pdf)\n\nNFTs are a technology that allow artists, patrons, and collectors to express and secure ownership of digital goods on a public ledger, and in doing so reveals preferences among and within socio-economic networks. This grants us an unprecedented view into the cultural norms of digital communities. For example, [Charlotte Kent (2021)](https://hyperallergic.com/652667/how-women-artists-have-been-marginalized-in-the-blockchain-discourse/) implicitly alludes to *generalized social exchange* occurring within communities of NFT artists:\n\n> “One notable feature of artists using blockchain is their interest in buying art with the funds they receive...This community-oriented attitude is reminiscent of early feminist practices”\n\nNFTs also allow us to express value for community-oriented attitudes and collective narratives in a new way. An excellent example of is the sale of the NFT “Dreaming at Dusk” (2021), created by Itzel Yard ([ixshells](https://foundation.app/@ixshells)), for 500 ETH (~two million dollars at the time of auction, May 14). The NFT supports the Tor Project, which describes its mission as:\n\n> To advance human rights and freedoms by creating and deploying free and open source anonymity and privacy technologies, supporting their unrestricted availability and use, and furthering their scientific and popular understanding.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/35855)\n\nDreaming at Dusk was collected by a on-chain organization called PleasrDAO. We therefore have a metric that hypothetically assigns a cultural attitude to the PleasrDAO community - according to those values inherent in the Tor Project: human rights through open-source privacy technology. This would extend for any account that bid on the audition for this work, all publicly viewable on-chain. \n\nThe preference for art, expressed through bidding and collecting NFTs, can be a map for digital identity - for a community as well as an individual.\n\n### DAOs as Token-Driven Culture\n\nCulture can measured by embedded \"collective narratives\", expressed in a shared language (*schemas*) and knitted together in a consistent manner. These can produce moral norms (beliefs, attitudes, and values) that inform behavior. \n\n> People construct social reality via the development, transmission, and institutionalization of shared patterns of thinking across generations.\n\n- Measuring Culture (2020), p. 23\n\nShorn, Lotti & Hart (2019) articulate how blockchains enable the organic development of organizations that form shared consensus - conceived as a \"headless brand*\"*, in their iconic article, [Headless Brands](https://otherinter.net/web3/headless-brands/):\n\n> While brands have traditionally been planned and designed directly by corporations, the rise of networked media has challenged the coherence of centrally-managed brand identities. New blockchain-based decentralized organizations take this a step further by giving users financial incentive to spread brand narratives of their own...In this way, a brand operates as a consensus system, facilitating a consistent set of beliefs across people.\n\nBeyond brands, social communities in general are beginning to proliferate around tokens. Friends with Benefits is one such example, whereby the access to the community and its productive capacity is gated by ownership of the token, and holders of the token are financially incentivized to increase its value. Members are interdependent within the community, and work to make it better without any formal organizational hierarchy - bound only by their values:\n\n> Friends with Benefits started as a private Discord server populated by our favorite thinkers and has since evolved into a global community bound together by shared values, shared incentives ($FWB) and shared IRL + URL experiences\n\n- [Evolution of the FWB DAO](https://zhang.mirror.xyz/9sRa2kNDUpkWoQkWw67bJ8PczFyTSX8fotf7JOddxew) - Alex Zhang (2021)\n\nBlockchains allow for people to play new kinds of coordination games, empowered by shared narratives and enacted by a decentralized organization of users. The classic example of a DAO is Bitcoin, which incentivizes millions of people to add labor to the project (in the form of marketing, research, or software development), without formally employing a single person. Although DAOs might have a core development team, or individuals who can influence the DAO's participants, there is no executive board with special powers.\n\nAs the number of people \"working for\" these DAOs expands, it takes on grander proportions, as articulated in [DAOs, Democracy and Governance](http://merkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf), 2016, by Ralph C. Merkle:\n\n> Modern research into “the wisdom of crowds” provides new insights into how to combine the expertise of all participants without handing over control to “experts”. Combined with research on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), this allows us to design a new form of democracy which is more stable, less prone to erratic behavior, better able to meet the needs of its citizens, and which better uses the expertise of all its citizens to make high-quality decisions. We call this new form of democracy a DAO Democracy.\n\nTaken to its most grand proportion, is Balaji's idea of starting a \"Crypto Civilization\":\n\n[https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1269178671086006273?s=20](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1269178671086006273?s=20)\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis post begins to explain how individual identity, viewed as the intersection of our social affiliations and tastes, is an emergent property of blockchain interactions. The richness of our on-chain identities increases as more people and content move onto these networks.\n\nWhile state-issued *formal identities* (e.g. SSN number) and corporation-issued informal identities (e.g. a Facebook login) entail severe security risks through centralization and a high decree of artificiality, decentralized identities promise persistent pseudonymity, while enabling economic cooperation and a greater expression of individuality through the collection of digital cultural objects and participation in DAOs. \n\nThis is a field in its infancy, but it clear that there is potential for crossover among the fields of computer science, network analysis, economic sociology, and many others, in the understanding of our on-chain identities.\n\nIf the use of blockchains continue to proliferate as they have so far, this may become one of the most meaningful fields of study in human history.", "timestamp": 1623806363, "digest": "17-QuzdJJ0n-WGtuFiSXpH13-F3XCBgiPYCRtKANwc8", "contributor": "0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026"}

They imagined these affiliations and interests as a system of coordinates, with each additional group determining one's individuality more exactly.\n\n> \"A man may be regarded as the point of intersection of an indefinite number of circles representing social groups\"\n- Cooley, Human Nature and the Social Order (1922)\n\nCooley specifically [anticipated](https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Cooley/Cooley_1902/Cooley_1902e.html) that expanding individuality is connected with the \"growth of communication\".

As we will see, crypto network analysis deepens this field immensely, and opens it to more accessible and accurate study.\n\n### Problems with this View\n\nFor most of us, the freedom to create intersectional individuality has been achieved through progressive social movements. For example, first and second wave feminism in the United States expanded women's interests and affiliations through ownership of property, and integration with political and workplace groups. Other examples would include the Black Consciousness Movement in South Africa, and the Gay Rights Movement globally.\n\nLooking through an optimistic lens, modernity is a progressive march towards inclusivity, which implies more group affiliation - a broader social life - and hence more individuality.

He is deeply steeped in nearly ever Jewish theological tradition and is ordained as a conservative rabbi, but runs a “God-optional” shul and was thrown out of the conservative rabbinate for marrying a Jew to a non-Jew. He knows and incorporates into his sermons more social theory and sociology than most rabbis, yet his shul is driven primarily by the contributions of a wide range of artists who draw on ancient Jewish traditions from all over the world.\n\nBut when considered holistically, the increasing multiplicity of our identities has benefited those belonging to some affiliations while, on a relative basis, been exponentially detrimental to others.\n\nThe [dominant use of the term \"intersectionality\"](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142) in social science today (starting with [Crenshaw, 1992](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1229039)), has built a framework for understanding of how oppression, derived from the combination of our social identities, is not merely additive:\n\n> How one form of oppression is experienced is influenced by and influences how another form is experienced. An additive analysis treats the oppression of a Black woman in a society that is racist as well as sexist as if it were a further burden when, in fact, it is a different burden ... sexism and racism must be seen as interlocking, and not as piled upon each other \n- [Spelman 1988](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/204131/inessential-woman-by-elizabeth-v-spelman/)\n\n> The term intersectionality references the critical insight that race, class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, nation, ability, and age operate not as unitary, mutually exclusive entities, but as reciprocally constructing phenomena that in turn shape complex social inequalities.\n- [Collins, 2015](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142)\n\nThese \"reciprocally constructing phenomena\" that may empower one person with increasing self-actualization, burden others with exponentially debilitating oppression. The fact that this extends to digital life can be deduced *a priori*, but examples are easy to generate: women are *more* targeted online than in real life, because of reduced friction to do so. Hate-speech is easier to propagate due to the algorithmically-amplified virality of content from polarized online groups.\n\nWhile we don't have long-term evidence for the efficacy of crypto networks as a tool for social liberation yet, crypto networks are unique in that they promise participants a highly functional \"persistent pseudonymity\" that has protective functions. An account on these networks does not necessarily reveal a person's nominal offline identity, but also allows its holder to participate in economic activity and exhibit individuality (e.g. group affiliation and taste), while hiding any unbidden or personal attributes likely to lead to oppression (e.g. nationality, race, gender, sex, etc).\n\n![Renée Cox, Chillin' with Liberty displays a vibrant visual mix of identities, from that of the painful distant-historical, to the brave and forward-looking, and from the sexual to the militant.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d10d9a15-5c05-4020-be8f-bf0259c529f4.jpeg?height=857&width=600)\n\n## NFTs as Cultural Objects with Socio-Economic Networks\n\n> Minting a token is an enactment of authenticity, an ontological shift in the history of representation.\n\n- A line from [A Feminist Manifesta of the Blockchain](https://hyperallergic.com/639180/a-feminist-manifesta-of-the-blockchain/) by Claudia Hart\n\nTechnological innovation allow artists to create objects that produce new meanings, social relations, and reputations within a field. Minting an NFT simultaneously creates art and its historical record, which allows us to explore these relations in a new way.\n\n### Technology and Economic Networks in the Construction of Identity\n\nIn *Beethoven and the Construction of Genius,* Tia Nora explains how the invention of the pianoforte was a determinant of Beethoven's success in his early days as a composer; the new sounds evoking a greater range of emotional responses in listeners. But DeNora also examined the social and economic networks that supported Beethoven in Vienna, providing insight into the origins of his identity as the genius we regard him to be today:\n\n> [DeNora] examines more closely than anyone else just which aristocrats supported Beethoven, where they were in the complex Austrian hierarchy, why they backed him, and how this affected aesthetic perceptions. Her study provides substantial insight into the interworking between musical creation and production and the social forces that shape them... \n- [Broyles (1995)](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/161449671.pdf)\n\nNFTs are a technology that allow artists, patrons, and collectors to express and secure ownership of digital goods on a public ledger, and in doing so reveals preferences among and within socio-economic networks. This grants us an unprecedented view into the cultural norms of digital communities. For example, [Charlotte Kent (2021)](https://hyperallergic.com/652667/how-women-artists-have-been-marginalized-in-the-blockchain-discourse/) implicitly alludes to *generalized social exchange* occurring within communities of NFT artists:\n\n> “One notable feature of artists using blockchain is their interest in buying art with the funds they receive...This community-oriented attitude is reminiscent of early feminist practices”\n\nNFTs also allow us to express value for community-oriented attitudes and collective narratives in a new way. An excellent example of is the sale of the NFT “Dreaming at Dusk” (2021), created by Itzel Yard ([ixshells](https://foundation.app/@ixshells)), for 500 ETH (~two million dollars at the time of auction, May 14). The NFT supports the Tor Project, which describes its mission as:\n\n> To advance human rights and freedoms by creating and deploying free and open source anonymity and privacy technologies, supporting their unrestricted availability and use, and furthering their scientific and popular understanding.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/35855)\n\nDreaming at Dusk was collected by a on-chain organization called PleasrDAO. We therefore have a metric that hypothetically assigns a cultural attitude to the PleasrDAO community - according to those values inherent in the Tor Project: human rights through open-source privacy technology. This would extend for any account that bid on the audition for this work, all publicly viewable on-chain. \n\nThe preference for art, expressed through bidding and collecting NFTs, can be a map for digital identity - for a community as well as an individual.\n\n### DAOs as Token-Driven Culture\n\nCulture can measured by embedded \"collective narratives\", expressed in a shared language (*schemas*) and knitted together in a consistent manner. These can produce moral norms (beliefs, attitudes, and values) that inform behavior. \n\n> People construct social reality via the development, transmission, and institutionalization of shared patterns of thinking across generations.\n\n- Measuring Culture (2020), p. 23\n\nShorn, Lotti & Hart (2019) articulate how blockchains enable the organic development of organizations that form shared consensus - conceived as a \"headless brand*\"*, in their iconic article, [Headless Brands](https://otherinter.net/web3/headless-brands/):\n\n> While brands have traditionally been planned and designed directly by corporations, the rise of networked media has challenged the coherence of centrally-managed brand identities. New blockchain-based decentralized organizations take this a step further by giving users financial incentive to spread brand narratives of their own...In this way, a brand operates as a consensus system, facilitating a consistent set of beliefs across people.\n\nBeyond brands, social communities in general are beginning to proliferate around tokens. Friends with Benefits is one such example, whereby the access to the community and its productive capacity is gated by ownership of the token, and holders of the token are financially incentivized to increase its value. Members are interdependent within the community, and work to make it better without any formal organizational hierarchy - bound only by their values:\n\n> Friends with Benefits started as a private Discord server populated by our favorite thinkers and has since evolved into a global community bound together by shared values, shared incentives ($FWB) and shared IRL + URL experiences\n\n- [Evolution of the FWB DAO](https://zhang.mirror.xyz/9sRa2kNDUpkWoQkWw67bJ8PczFyTSX8fotf7JOddxew) - Alex Zhang (2021)\n\nBlockchains allow for people to play new kinds of coordination games, empowered by shared narratives and enacted by a decentralized organization of users. The classic example of a DAO is Bitcoin, which incentivizes millions of people to add labor to the project (in the form of marketing, research, or software development), without formally employing a single person. Although DAOs might have a core development team, or individuals who can influence the DAO's participants, there is no executive board with special powers.\n\nAs the number of people \"working for\" these DAOs expands, it takes on grander proportions, as articulated in [DAOs, Democracy and Governance](http://merkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf), 2016, by Ralph C. Merkle:\n\n> Modern research into “the wisdom of crowds” provides new insights into how to combine the expertise of all participants without handing over control to “experts”. Combined with research on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), this allows us to design a new form of democracy which is more stable, less prone to erratic behavior, better able to meet the needs of its citizens, and which better uses the expertise of all its citizens to make high-quality decisions. We call this new form of democracy a DAO Democracy.\n\nTaken to its most grand proportion, is Balaji's idea of starting a \"Crypto Civilization\":\n\n[https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1269178671086006273?s=20](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1269178671086006273?s=20)\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis post begins to explain how individual identity, viewed as the intersection of our social affiliations and tastes, is an emergent property of blockchain interactions. The richness of our on-chain identities increases as more people and content move onto these networks.\n\nWhile state-issued *formal identities* (e.g. SSN number) and corporation-issued informal identities (e.g. a Facebook login) entail severe security risks through centralization and a high decree of artificiality, decentralized identities promise persistent pseudonymity, while enabling economic cooperation and a greater expression of individuality through the collection of digital cultural objects and participation in DAOs. \n\nThis is a field in its infancy, but it clear that there is potential for crossover among the fields of computer science, network analysis, economic sociology, and many others, in the understanding of our on-chain identities.\n\nIf the use of blockchains continue to proliferate as they have so far, this may become one of the most meaningful fields of study in human history.", "timestamp": 1623807229, "digest": "17-QuzdJJ0n-WGtuFiSXpH13-F3XCBgiPYCRtKANwc8", "contributor": "0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026"}

The space has you covered for anything ranging from [peer-to-protocol lending protocols](https://aave.com/) to [insurance policies that protect users from loss of funds due to protocol bugs](https://nexusmutual.io/). Derivative protocols like [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) have you covered for any investments in non ETH-based assets, and you need look no further than [Opyn](https://www.opyn.co/) for all your cash-settled options trading needs. \n\nThe space is quickly starting to resemble a fully functional financial system, with all the applications and systems needed for standard retail investor transactions established and regularly audited, but also the most niche structured products thriving and innovating further with every passing day. \n\nHowever, the most striking difference is that DeFi is trying to do what TradFi (Traditional Finance) did over the past 2,000 years in just a couple of years. This pace of innovation is in large part aided by the true and native [composability](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-true-power-of-defi-composability-14fe8355e0d0#:~:text=Composability%2C%20in%20DeFi%2C%20is%20the,and%20therefore%20each%20other's%20utility.) of DeFi which allows projects to seamlessly integrate with each other like Lego and create mind-blowing synergies. DeFi is well on its way to catching up to TradFi in terms of functionality and has its eyes set on surpassing it as soon as the mainstream is ready. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6d974fc1-8031-47f3-9f5b-4bda5509abc9.png?height=700&width=1801)\n\nThe future is bright for DeFi, and the space is always vibrant and full of energy, no matter the state of the overall crypto market. We are still a while away from widespread adoption of DeFi, and as many people often say, *we are still early*. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), the most popular chrome extension based wallet used to interact with DeFi, only recently reached 5 million monthly active users. Mainstream adoption too soon would potentially come at the wrong time for DeFi as the applications may not be properly optimised to support the large and sudden influx of users, but I have had a lot of time to think about this problem lately and have come to some conclusions about what I believe are the main hurdles DeFi needs to surpass before it is truly ready for the *mainnet* to hit the *mainstream*.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/76a440fa-1ae5-443a-97fd-356ebd1a0f25.png?height=848&width=2152)\n\nI call these hurdles **the Three \"U\"s of DeFi Ubiquity**.\n\n#### Usability\n\nThe first, and arguably most important of these hurdles to ubiquity, is usability. Many of the most successful DeFi protocols are advanced, regularly audited and professionally run but have user interfaces that are unapproachable to all but the most sophisticated investors. In reality, the underlying service these protocols are offering is groundbreaking in the quest for the democratisation of many of the world's most powerful financial instruments which were previously unavailable to most retail investors. Consequently it is important that the people set to benefit the most from this democratisation are also able to understand and use these tools without having to resort to financial advisors.\n\nThe key to this issue is going to be knowing which parts of the UI to hide, and which to display prominently. [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) is one of the market leaders in keeping its UI simple yet powerful. Still, there will eventually be a divergence of the consumer level interfaces and pro-level interfaces using the same backend, a bit like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) vs [Coinbase **Pro**](https://pro.coinbase.com) to really drive this point home. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) does not focus greatly on UI refinement at the moment, but it will take a [beginner-friendly browser wallet](https://rainbow.me) that has a good fiat on-ramp and perhaps doesn't even refer to itself as a wallet but more as a key to Web3 to really help push DApps into the mainstream. \n\nIncreasingly we will start to see startups cropping up worldwide in various industries focusing on leveraging DeFi technologies to verticalise and fine-tune the experience for different audiences with different financial preferences. The technology behind many of the most popular DeFi protocols is optimised for scale, performance and reliability, so there is a wide-open opportunity for startups to come into specific geographies such as developing economies, where debt financing for small businesses is harder to come by, and build a straightforward front end. This front end could then automatically tap into the sea of open-source protocols and liquidity that is readily available. It could then focus on making it accessible to non-crypto-native audiences with seamless on-ramps for Fiat which, in the future, could allow someone in Venezuela to take out a loan using stablecoins on [AAVE](http://aave.com/) using an [L2 solution like Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) without ever noticing that they have done all of this on a trustless and decentralised back end. \n\nIdeally, customers would eventually be aware of the fact that they are interacting with DeFi, but in order to reach a truly mainstream audience there will be a transitionary period where perhaps these front ends do not lean too heavily into the crypto angle. This movement comes straight out of the playbook of new Fintech startups like [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) and [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/) that have spent the past decade taking complex financial systems, reducing their complexity and making them accessible to retail investors. These startups often build on top of TradFi and reduce friction for retail users by bending the rules or by [bundling transactions together](https://www.freetrade.io). DeFi could use the same approach and reduce friction even further by abstracting away the complexities of the Ethereum blockchain and presenting a seamless solution to the end-user. It is unlikely that this simplified DeFi front end innovation will come from the existing Fintech incumbents because the way they are used to working is so different to the way DeFi works. TradFi Fintech startups are used to pushing up against and fighting the traditional systems to try and squeeze them into a user experience that is pleasant to use. The DeFi space is flexible by design so the approach taken by these verticalised DeFi gateways will be simple, and even encouraged by the protocols themselves, contrary to the struggles faced by TradFi Fintech startups where in this case the incumbent banks are constantly trying to play catch-up with the challenger Fintech startups . \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/619cb9ed-b108-46e9-af75-3b211568bb06.png?height=806&width=1825)\n\nWhile there will be many independent startups fulfilling this function and maybe even getting funded through the protocols' own grants DAOs, many of these usability improvements will also come from the protocols' own core teams, especially on the institutional side. Institutional TradFi, at least in the short term, tends to prefer interacting directly with the people that built the technology they are going to be leveraging. [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) has actually started experimenting with [permissioned pools for institutional investors](https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-lending-platform-aave-reveals-private-pool-for-institutions) because institutional investors previously found it tough to use the protocol due to lack of [KYC and AML](https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/kyc-aml-know-your-customer-vs-anti-money-laundering/) compliance, and this has allowed banks and other institutional clients using [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) to know that the other parties in the network are compliant and vetted not to be on an [OFAC sanctions list](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information). This is just another example of DeFi slightly adapting to TradFi without compromising on their core principles as an almost intermediate stage to mainstream adoption. Whether that be through making it feel like Fiat through stable-coins, or increasing KYC for institutions to help them to feel more at ease about the protocols they are transacting with, these measures all go a long way towards lowering hurdles to mass adoption. \n\nIt is also likely that whilst at this early stage the protocol teams themselves are working on the UI and UX as well as the underlying infrastructure, they may slowly start to shift their focus away from the consumer side and specialise more on the protocol itself. This would likely manifest itself in protocols keeping their existing UIs more as a reference with the aim of slowly phasing them out in the very long-term. Platforms like [Zapper](https://www.zapper.fi) and [Zerion](https://zerion.io/), which are focused almost exclusively on usability and accessibility, will then step in to focus on the front ends and leave the protocol teams free to optimise their platforms.\n\nThe runway is wide open, and the tech is ready. These protocols exist and are being built and tested by thousands of users every day. The best part is that anyone can come in and make them more useful to any specific demographic. Look no further than projects like [Ribbon](https://www.ribbon.finance) to see this in action. [Ribbon](htts://www.ribbon.finance) has made some sophisticated covered call strategies available to anyone with a [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io/) by building directly on [Opyn's](https://www.opyn.co/) cash-settled ETH options protocol, all while making it feel as simple as an, admittedly high-risk, savings account to the end-user.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0ec888-d3db-4856-af1d-48280478715d.png?height=851&width=2325)\n\n#### Undercolateralisation \n\nThe second hurdle is the issue of overcolateralisation in DeFi lending protocols. When you put the whole DeFi stack together, what you are left with is essentially a fully decentralised crypto bank that runs itself in the most traditional sense of the word. DeFi, just like a bank, allows you to convert between currencies, deposit money and receive interest in return for providing liquidity to the bank to then allow them to loan it back out. On the other side of the equation, anyone can then go to the bank, take out a loan and then pay it back at a rate most suited to their risk profile and time horizon. In TradFi some loans are unsecured, but many are secured in that they have some form of collateral backing the loan. If you fail to pay back said loan, the traditional bank has the legal authority to repossess that asset and liquidate it in exchange for cash. The percentage of the total loan required as collateral often depends on a credit score and past successful repayment of loans. Some traditional bank loans are overcollateralised when the asset is highly illiquid to make sure that enough cash can be recouped in the event of a loan default. Conversely in most DeFi lending protocols, you need to provide significantly more crypto as collateral than the stable-coins you are borrowing, sometimes as much as 700%.\n\nIt can be hard to understand why someone would ever want to take out a loan worth less than the amount they are putting down as collateral, and whilst there are some valid reasons for this such as delaying a taxable event or increasing leverage on positions through complex financial gymnastics, the vast majority of the world is **unwilling** or, more importantly, **unable** to borrow money in this way. \n\nThe main reason people borrow money is precisely because they do not have the spare capital available at that time. People take out mortgages to buy houses, or take out loans to start a small business in their hometown. Sometimes a mortgage may even start highly collateralised but later turn undercollateralised if the value of the house goes down, however due to the credit history of the borrower the loan is still able to remain a [_performing loan_](https://pocketsense.com/difference-between-performing-nonperforming-loans-12224160.html). The downside of undercollateralisation is of course that if the loan were to default, the collateral would not be able to cover the principal. In this case, the borrower would step in to cover the difference if they are in fact creditworthy and have some reputational skin in the game not to run off with the money with no consequence. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/17b662fe-a9af-4b5c-afda-aeb07b88e131.png?height=845&width=2138)\n\nTo cater properly to these kinds of users it is important that DeFi eventually gets to a point where loans can be undercollateralised in some way. The difficulty is that DeFi is by its very nature anonymous and trustless, which means that the concept of social proof and credit scores becomes very difficult to handle and potentially even ideologically problematic. A potential solution could be a quasi-anonymous loan passport solution in which the user is anonymous on one dimension but not on another, i.e. their wallet address is public, but the owner of the wallet is not. One could, in theory, understand someone's creditworthiness through their DeFi loans history, which is of course publicly visible on Web3 or even decrease the user's collateral requirement for their next loan by a certain percentage every time they repay successfully. Another alternative is allowing user loans to be secured and guaranteed by other individuals they know in real life that trust the borrower enough to guarantee their loan and [delegate their credit](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/credit-delegation). \n\nPerhaps we could even see some CeFi institutions step in to perform credit checks on DeFi users on a per address basis. This solution would, of course, introduce some centralisation as it would involve real-identity based KYC, but may be a necessary interim solution for users that prioritise a low collateral ratio over absolute anonymity as lending protocols could eventually introduce pools of loans where a trusted third party has verified creditworthiness in advance. This CeFi verification could also be a [Zero Knowledge Proof](https://www.wired.com/story/zero-knowledge-proofs/), in that the verifiying party would know that the borrower is creditworthy but would essentially allow the borrowers to prove their creditworthiness to another party without having to reveal their identity. When the borrower proves their creditworthiness with zero-knowledge, they would display the fact that the CeFi institution has deemed them creditworthy as almost a boolean value in their wallet, perhaps as a non-transferrable NFT.\n\nThere are already some great projects being built in this space like [teller.finance](https://www.teller.finance/) which is taking a similar approach by connecting to your bank account through [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) and then offering risk-assessed DeFi loans on their platform without the need for collateral. Although we are still a while away from a foolproof creditworthiness checker solution in DeFi there are many different approaches one can take and I believe a combination of these approaches will play a large part in solving the issue of collateralisation in the quest for widespread adoption.\n\n#### Understability\n\nThe final hurdle that, depending on how you look at things could be the hardest or easiest of these to solve, is the difficulty around understandability and education. This hurdle may ultimately solve itself if the first two issues are solved and DeFi starts to resemble the way in which users are used to dealing with and thinking about finances. However, it is still important to acknowledge that for non-technical people, the DeFi space can be very opaque and consequently more difficult to trust.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/46fc773f-114b-42c0-b1db-eade3492e306.png?height=697&width=2015)\n\nFiat money and the way centralised traditional financial systems work is deeply ingrained in our culture and is a little easier to properly comprehend because many parts of the system rely on trust and simple written agreements which come together to form financial systems. Understanding the way these systems work in DeFi is a lot less straightforward. While in TradFi it is relatively straightforward to explain the basics of how a bank works, in that one can deposit money, and in return the bank lends that money out and pays interest for that privilege. There are very few parts of that process that are opaque because, ultimately, it just involves numbers moving from one spreadsheet to another.\n\nThe difference with DeFi is that you first have to feel comfortable with the concept of decentralisation, anonymity, trustless systems, distributed ledgers, and then you have to try and explain how all of this functions automatically through smart-contracts. There are many parts of DeFi that have to be hand-waved away and perhaps this could become a hindrance to trust. \n\nOne could also, of course, argue that many people implicitly trust the banking system because enough other trusted people do and not because they understand every part of the process. The same could eventually be true when enough knowledgeable people trust DeFi and understand a good enough percentage of the current information gaps. \n\nThere are some great resources out there like [Finematics](https://finematics.com/) and [Bankless](https://banklesshq.com/) doing amazing things in the education space and teaching newcomers about all things DeFi. This will be crucial in making sure people are comfortable enough with the technology to use it, especially when currently decentralisation slightly goes against the grain and users may be met with scepticism from friends and family. \n\nIt should, however, be noted that the younger digital-native generation finds the concept of digital money extremely intuitive as they have grown up interacting with various in-game currencies and the youngest among them have potentially never even used physical cash in their lives. This will undoubedly make the proliferation of DeFi a more natural process as Gen-Z is starting to trust the digital world more than physical and may even start to learn about finance through DeFi in context rather than adapting antiquated financial concepts to fit the DeFi world as in the current status-quo.\n\n\n\nOverall the space is going in all the right directions. It will take a while for these ideas to materialise fully, but this is the part that interests me the most about the DeFi space. There is so much mind-blowing R&D going on every day, and people are experimenting, taking risks and breaking boundaries. I'm very passionate about making sure as many people as possible have access to these tools and can take part in the revolution. Understanding the pieces of the puzzle left to fill will become increasingly important as the protocols we rely on are built out and refined and start to look towards the next steps.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this piece 💙 \n\nIf you enjoyed the piece and are interested in receiving more of my content or keeping up to date with anything else I get up to a follow on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/coconidodev) would be great... or if you're more of an email person that works too - **subscribe to my infrequent mailing list** via the link below.", "timestamp": 1623835185, "digest": "klQF-dVD9TOVI288YuTObvBVY5_GsrmBGDunRoWpYt8", "contributor": "0xcde3725B25D6d9bC78CF0941cC15Fd9710c764b9"}

DeFi is well on its way to catching up to TradFi in terms of functionality and has its eyes set on surpassing it as soon as the mainstream is ready. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6d974fc1-8031-47f3-9f5b-4bda5509abc9.png?height=700&width=1801)\n\nThe future is bright for DeFi, and the space is always vibrant and full of energy, no matter the state of the overall crypto market. We are still a while away from widespread adoption of DeFi, and as many people often say, *we are still early*. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), the most popular chrome extension based wallet used to interact with DeFi, only recently reached 5 million monthly active users. Mainstream adoption too soon would potentially come at the wrong time for DeFi as the applications may not be properly optimised to support the large and sudden influx of users, but I have had a lot of time to think about this problem lately and have come to some conclusions about what I believe are the main hurdles DeFi needs to surpass before it is truly ready for the *mainnet* to hit the *mainstream*.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/76a440fa-1ae5-443a-97fd-356ebd1a0f25.png?height=848&width=2152)\n\nI call these hurdles **the Three \"U\"s of DeFi Ubiquity**.\n\n#### Usability\n\nThe first, and arguably most important of these hurdles to ubiquity, is usability. Many of the most successful DeFi protocols are advanced, regularly audited and professionally run but have user interfaces that are unapproachable to all but the most sophisticated investors. In reality, the underlying service these protocols are offering is groundbreaking in the quest for the democratisation of many of the world's most powerful financial instruments which were previously unavailable to most retail investors. Consequently it is important that the people set to benefit the most from this democratisation are also able to understand and use these tools without having to resort to financial advisors.\n\nThe key to this issue is going to be knowing which parts of the UI to hide, and which to display prominently. [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) is one of the market leaders in keeping its UI simple yet powerful. Still, there will eventually be a divergence of the consumer level interfaces and pro-level interfaces using the same backend, a bit like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) vs [Coinbase **Pro**](https://pro.coinbase.com) to really drive this point home. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) does not focus greatly on UI refinement at the moment, but it will take a [beginner-friendly browser wallet](https://rainbow.me) that has a good fiat on-ramp and perhaps doesn't even refer to itself as a wallet but more as a key to Web3 to really help push DApps into the mainstream. \n\nIncreasingly we will start to see startups cropping up worldwide in various industries focusing on leveraging DeFi technologies to verticalise and fine-tune the experience for different audiences with different financial preferences. The technology behind many of the most popular DeFi protocols is optimised for scale, performance and reliability, so there is a wide-open opportunity for startups to come into specific geographies such as developing economies, where debt financing for small businesses is harder to come by, and build a straightforward front end. This front end could then automatically tap into the sea of open-source protocols and liquidity that is readily available. It could then focus on making it accessible to non-crypto-native audiences with seamless on-ramps for Fiat which, in the future, could allow someone in Venezuela to take out a loan using stablecoins on [AAVE](http://aave.com/) using an [L2 solution like Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) without ever noticing that they have done all of this on a trustless and decentralised back end. \n\nIdeally, customers would eventually be aware of the fact that they are interacting with DeFi, but in order to reach a truly mainstream audience there will be a transitionary period where perhaps these front ends do not lean too heavily into the crypto angle. This movement comes straight out of the playbook of new Fintech startups like [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) and [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/) that have spent the past decade taking complex financial systems, reducing their complexity and making them accessible to retail investors. These startups often build on top of TradFi and reduce friction for retail users by bending the rules or by [bundling transactions together](https://www.freetrade.io). DeFi could use the same approach and reduce friction even further by abstracting away the complexities of the Ethereum blockchain and presenting a seamless solution to the end-user. It is unlikely that this simplified DeFi front end innovation will come from the existing Fintech incumbents because the way they are used to working is so different to the way DeFi works. TradFi Fintech startups are used to pushing up against and fighting the traditional systems to try and squeeze them into a user experience that is pleasant to use. The DeFi space is flexible by design so the approach taken by these verticalised DeFi gateways will be simple, and even encouraged by the protocols themselves, contrary to the struggles faced by TradFi Fintech startups where in this case the incumbent banks are constantly trying to play catch-up with the challenger Fintech startups . \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/619cb9ed-b108-46e9-af75-3b211568bb06.png?height=806&width=1825)\n\nWhile there will be many independent startups fulfilling this function and maybe even getting funded through the protocols' own grants DAOs, many of these usability improvements will also come from the protocols' own core teams, especially on the institutional side. Institutional TradFi, at least in the short term, tends to prefer interacting directly with the people that built the technology they are going to be leveraging. [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) has actually started experimenting with [permissioned pools for institutional investors](https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-lending-platform-aave-reveals-private-pool-for-institutions) because institutional investors previously found it tough to use the protocol due to lack of [KYC and AML](https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/kyc-aml-know-your-customer-vs-anti-money-laundering/) compliance, and this has allowed banks and other institutional clients using [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) to know that the other parties in the network are compliant and vetted not to be on an [OFAC sanctions list](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information). This is just another example of DeFi slightly adapting to TradFi without compromising on their core principles as an almost intermediate stage to mainstream adoption. Whether that be through making it feel like Fiat through stable-coins, or increasing KYC for institutions to help them to feel more at ease about the protocols they are transacting with, these measures all go a long way towards lowering hurdles to mass adoption. \n\nIt is also likely that whilst at this early stage the protocol teams themselves are working on the UI and UX as well as the underlying infrastructure, they may slowly start to shift their focus away from the consumer side and specialise more on the protocol itself. This would likely manifest itself in protocols keeping their existing UIs more as a reference with the aim of slowly phasing them out in the very long-term. Platforms like [Zapper](https://www.zapper.fi) and [Zerion](https://zerion.io/), which are focused almost exclusively on usability and accessibility, will then step in to focus on the front ends and leave the protocol teams free to optimise their platforms.\n\nThe runway is wide open, and the tech is ready. These protocols exist and are being built and tested by thousands of users every day. The best part is that anyone can come in and make them more useful to any specific demographic. Look no further than projects like [Ribbon](https://www.ribbon.finance) to see this in action. [Ribbon](htts://www.ribbon.finance) has made some sophisticated covered call strategies available to anyone with a [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io/) by building directly on [Opyn's](https://www.opyn.co/) cash-settled ETH options protocol, all while making it feel as simple as an, admittedly high-risk, savings account to the end-user.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0ec888-d3db-4856-af1d-48280478715d.png?height=851&width=2325)\n\n#### Undercolateralisation \n\nThe second hurdle is the issue of overcolateralisation in DeFi lending protocols. When you put the whole DeFi stack together, what you are left with is essentially a fully decentralised crypto bank that runs itself in the most traditional sense of the word. DeFi, just like a bank, allows you to convert between currencies, deposit money and receive interest in return for providing liquidity to the bank to then allow them to loan it back out. On the other side of the equation, anyone can then go to the bank, take out a loan and then pay it back at a rate most suited to their risk profile and time horizon. In TradFi some loans are unsecured, but many are secured in that they have some form of collateral backing the loan. If you fail to pay back said loan, the traditional bank has the legal authority to repossess that asset and liquidate it in exchange for cash. The percentage of the total loan required as collateral often depends on a credit score and past successful repayment of loans. Some traditional bank loans are overcollateralised when the asset is highly illiquid to make sure that enough cash can be recouped in the event of a loan default. Conversely in most DeFi lending protocols, you need to provide significantly more crypto as collateral than the stable-coins you are borrowing, sometimes as much as 700%.\n\nIt can be hard to understand why someone would ever want to take out a loan worth less than the amount they are putting down as collateral, and whilst there are some valid reasons for this such as delaying a taxable event or increasing leverage on positions through complex financial gymnastics, the vast majority of the world is **unwilling** or, more importantly, **unable** to borrow money in this way. \n\nThe main reason people borrow money is precisely because they do not have the spare capital available at that time. People take out mortgages to buy houses, or take out loans to start a small business in their hometown. Sometimes a mortgage may even start highly collateralised but later turn undercollateralised if the value of the house goes down, however due to the credit history of the borrower the loan is still able to remain a [_performing loan_](https://pocketsense.com/difference-between-performing-nonperforming-loans-12224160.html). The downside of undercollateralisation is of course that if the loan were to default, the collateral would not be able to cover the principal. In this case, the borrower would step in to cover the difference if they are in fact creditworthy and have some reputational skin in the game not to run off with the money with no consequence. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/17b662fe-a9af-4b5c-afda-aeb07b88e131.png?height=845&width=2138)\n\nTo cater properly to these kinds of users it is important that DeFi eventually gets to a point where loans can be undercollateralised in some way. The difficulty is that DeFi is by its very nature anonymous and trustless, which means that the concept of social proof and credit scores becomes very difficult to handle and potentially even ideologically problematic. A potential solution could be a quasi-anonymous loan passport solution in which the user is anonymous on one dimension but not on another, i.e. their wallet address is public, but the owner of the wallet is not. One could, in theory, understand someone's creditworthiness through their DeFi loans history, which is of course publicly visible on Web3 or even decrease the user's collateral requirement for their next loan by a certain percentage every time they repay successfully. Another alternative is allowing user loans to be secured and guaranteed by other individuals they know in real life that trust the borrower enough to guarantee their loan and [delegate their credit](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/credit-delegation). \n\nPerhaps we could even see some CeFi institutions step in to perform credit checks on DeFi users on a per address basis. This solution would, of course, introduce some centralisation as it would involve real-identity based KYC, but may be a necessary interim solution for users that prioritise a low collateral ratio over absolute anonymity as lending protocols could eventually introduce pools of loans where a trusted third party has verified creditworthiness in advance. This CeFi verification could also be a [Zero Knowledge Proof](https://www.wired.com/story/zero-knowledge-proofs/), in that the verifiying party would know that the borrower is creditworthy but would essentially allow the borrowers to prove their creditworthiness to another party without having to reveal their identity. When the borrower proves their creditworthiness with zero-knowledge, they would display the fact that the CeFi institution has deemed them creditworthy as almost a boolean value in their wallet, perhaps as a non-transferrable NFT.\n\nThere are already some great projects being built in this space like [teller.finance](https://www.teller.finance/) which is taking a similar approach by connecting to your bank account through [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) and then offering risk-assessed DeFi loans on their platform without the need for collateral. Although we are still a while away from a foolproof creditworthiness checker solution in DeFi there are many different approaches one can take and I believe a combination of these approaches will play a large part in solving the issue of collateralisation in the quest for widespread adoption.\n\n#### Understability\n\nThe final hurdle that, depending on how you look at things could be the hardest or easiest of these to solve, is the difficulty around understandability and education. This hurdle may ultimately solve itself if the first two issues are solved and DeFi starts to resemble the way in which users are used to dealing with and thinking about finances. However, it is still important to acknowledge that for non-technical people, the DeFi space can be very opaque and consequently more difficult to trust.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/46fc773f-114b-42c0-b1db-eade3492e306.png?height=697&width=2015)\n\nFiat money and the way centralised traditional financial systems work is deeply ingrained in our culture and is a little easier to properly comprehend because many parts of the system rely on trust and simple written agreements which come together to form financial systems. Understanding the way these systems work in DeFi is a lot less straightforward. While in TradFi it is relatively straightforward to explain the basics of how a bank works, in that one can deposit money, and in return the bank lends that money out and pays interest for that privilege. There are very few parts of that process that are opaque because, ultimately, it just involves numbers moving from one spreadsheet to another.\n\nThe difference with DeFi is that you first have to feel comfortable with the concept of decentralisation, anonymity, trustless systems, distributed ledgers, and then you have to try and explain how all of this functions automatically through smart-contracts. There are many parts of DeFi that have to be hand-waved away and perhaps this could become a hindrance to trust. \n\nOne could also, of course, argue that many people implicitly trust the banking system because enough other trusted people do and not because they understand every part of the process. The same could eventually be true when enough knowledgeable people trust DeFi and understand a good enough percentage of the current information gaps. \n\nThere are some great resources out there like [Finematics](https://finematics.com/) and [Bankless](https://banklesshq.com/) doing amazing things in the education space and teaching newcomers about all things DeFi. This will be crucial in making sure people are comfortable enough with the technology to use it, especially when currently decentralisation slightly goes against the grain and users may be met with scepticism from friends and family. \n\nIt should, however, be noted that the younger digital-native generation finds the concept of digital money extremely intuitive as they have grown up interacting with various in-game currencies and the youngest among them have potentially never even used physical cash in their lives. This will undoubedly make the proliferation of DeFi a more natural process as Gen-Z is starting to trust the digital world more than physical and may even start to learn about finance through DeFi in context rather than adapting antiquated financial concepts to fit the DeFi world as in the current status-quo.\n\n\n\nOverall the space is going in all the right directions. It will take a while for these ideas to materialise fully, but this is the part that interests me the most about the DeFi space. There is so much mind-blowing R&D going on every day, and people are experimenting, taking risks and breaking boundaries. I'm very passionate about making sure as many people as possible have access to these tools and can take part in the revolution. Understanding the pieces of the puzzle left to fill will become increasingly important as the protocols we rely on are built out and refined and start to look towards the next steps.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this piece 💙 \n\nIf you enjoyed the piece and are interested in receiving more of my content or keeping up to date with anything else I get up to a follow on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/coconidodev) would be great... or if you're more of an email person that works too - **subscribe to my infrequent mailing list** via the link below.", "timestamp": 1623836699, "digest": "klQF-dVD9TOVI288YuTObvBVY5_GsrmBGDunRoWpYt8", "contributor": "0xcde3725B25D6d9bC78CF0941cC15Fd9710c764b9"}

When the borrower proves their creditworthiness with zero-knowledge, they would display the fact that the CeFi institution has deemed them creditworthy as almost a boolean value in their wallet, perhaps as a non-transferrable NFT.\n\nThere are already some great projects being built in this space like [teller.finance](https://www.teller.finance/) which is taking a similar approach by connecting to your bank account through [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) and then offering risk-assessed DeFi loans on their platform without the need for collateral. Although we are still a while away from a foolproof creditworthiness checker solution in DeFi there are many different approaches one can take and I believe a combination of these approaches will play a large part in solving the issue of collateralisation in the quest for widespread adoption.\n\n#### Understability\n\nThe final hurdle that, depending on how you look at things could be the hardest or easiest of these to solve, is the difficulty around understandability and education. This hurdle may ultimately solve itself if the first two issues are solved and DeFi starts to resemble the way in which users are used to dealing with and thinking about finances. However, it is still important to acknowledge that for non-technical people, the DeFi space can be very opaque and consequently more difficult to trust.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/46fc773f-114b-42c0-b1db-eade3492e306.png?height=697&width=2015)\n\nFiat money and the way centralised traditional financial systems work is deeply ingrained in our culture and is a little easier to properly comprehend because many parts of the system rely on trust and simple written agreements which come together to form financial systems. Understanding the way these systems work in DeFi is a lot less straightforward. While in TradFi it is relatively straightforward to explain the basics of how a bank works, in that one can deposit money, and in return the bank lends that money out and pays interest for that privilege. There are very few parts of that process that are opaque because, ultimately, it just involves numbers moving from one spreadsheet to another.\n\nThe difference with DeFi is that you first have to feel comfortable with the concept of decentralisation, anonymity, trustless systems, distributed ledgers, and then you have to try and explain how all of this functions automatically through smart-contracts. There are many parts of DeFi that have to be hand-waved away and perhaps this could become a hindrance to trust. \n\nOne could also, of course, argue that many people implicitly trust the banking system because enough other trusted people do and not because they understand every part of the process. The same could eventually be true when enough knowledgeable people trust DeFi and understand a good enough percentage of the current information gaps. \n\nThere are some great resources out there like [Finematics](https://finematics.com/) and [Bankless](https://banklesshq.com/) doing amazing things in the education space and teaching newcomers about all things DeFi. This will be crucial in making sure people are comfortable enough with the technology to use it, especially when currently decentralisation slightly goes against the grain and users may be met with scepticism from friends and family. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/56920551-f6e6-47ad-b44d-493b815bc264.png?height=589&width=1262)\n\nIt should, however, be noted that the younger digital-native generation finds the concept of digital money extremely intuitive as they have grown up interacting with various in-game currencies and the youngest among them have potentially never even used physical cash in their lives. This will undoubedly make the proliferation of DeFi a more natural process as Gen-Z is starting to trust the digital world more than physical and may even start to learn about finance through DeFi in context rather than adapting antiquated financial concepts to fit the DeFi world as in the current status-quo.\n\n\n\nOverall the space is going in all the right directions. It will take a while for these ideas to materialise fully, but this is the part that interests me the most about the DeFi space. There is so much mind-blowing R&D going on every day, and people are experimenting, taking risks and breaking boundaries. I'm very passionate about making sure as many people as possible have access to these tools and can take part in the revolution. Understanding the pieces of the puzzle left to fill will become increasingly important as the protocols we rely on are built out and refined and start to look towards the next steps.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this piece 💙 \n\nIf you enjoyed the piece and are interested in receiving more of my content or keeping up to date with anything else I get up to a follow on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/coconidodev) would be great... or if you're more of an email person that works too - **subscribe to my infrequent mailing list** via the link below.", "timestamp": 1623838634, "digest": "klQF-dVD9TOVI288YuTObvBVY5_GsrmBGDunRoWpYt8", "contributor": "0xcde3725B25D6d9bC78CF0941cC15Fd9710c764b9"}

The space has you covered for anything ranging from [peer-to-protocol lending protocols](https://aave.com/) to [insurance policies that protect users from loss of funds due to protocol bugs](https://nexusmutual.io/). Derivative protocols like [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) have you covered for any investments in non ETH-based assets, and you need look no further than [Opyn](https://www.opyn.co/) for all your cash-settled options trading needs. \n\nThe space is quickly starting to resemble a fully functional financial system, with all the applications and systems needed for standard retail investor transactions established and regularly audited, but also the most niche structured products thriving and innovating further with every passing day. \n\nHowever, the most striking difference is that DeFi is trying to do what TradFi (Traditional Finance) did over the past 2,000 years in just a couple of years. This pace of innovation is in large part aided by the true and native [composability](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-true-power-of-defi-composability-14fe8355e0d0#:~:text=Composability%2C%20in%20DeFi%2C%20is%20the,and%20therefore%20each%20other's%20utility.) of DeFi which allows projects to seamlessly integrate with each other like Lego and create mind-blowing synergies. DeFi is well on its way to catching up to TradFi in terms of functionality and has its eyes set on surpassing it as soon as the mainstream is ready. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6d974fc1-8031-47f3-9f5b-4bda5509abc9.png?height=700&width=1801)\n\nThe future is bright for DeFi, and the space is always vibrant and full of energy, no matter the state of the overall crypto market. We are still a while away from widespread adoption of DeFi, and as many people often say, *we are still early*. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), the most popular chrome extension based wallet used to interact with DeFi, only recently reached 5 million monthly active users. Mainstream adoption too soon would potentially come at the wrong time for DeFi as the applications may not be properly optimised to support the large and sudden influx of users, but I have had a lot of time to think about this problem lately and have come to some conclusions about what I believe are the main hurdles DeFi needs to surpass before it is truly ready for the *mainnet* to hit the *mainstream*.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/76a440fa-1ae5-443a-97fd-356ebd1a0f25.png?height=848&width=2152)\n\nI call these hurdles **the Three \"U\"s of DeFi Ubiquity**.\n\n#### Usability\n\nThe first, and arguably most important of these hurdles to ubiquity, is usability. Many of the most successful DeFi protocols are advanced, regularly audited and professionally run but have user interfaces that are unapproachable to all but the most sophisticated investors. In reality, the underlying service these protocols are offering is groundbreaking in the quest for the democratisation of many of the world's most powerful financial instruments which were previously unavailable to most retail investors. Consequently it is important that the people set to benefit the most from this democratisation are also able to understand and use these tools without having to resort to financial advisors.\n\nThe key to this issue is going to be knowing which parts of the UI to hide, and which to display prominently. [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) is one of the market leaders in keeping its UI simple yet powerful. Still, there will eventually be a divergence of the consumer level interfaces and pro-level interfaces using the same backend, a bit like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) vs [Coinbase **Pro**](https://pro.coinbase.com) to really drive this point home. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) does not focus greatly on UI refinement at the moment, but it will take a [beginner-friendly browser wallet](https://rainbow.me) that has a good fiat on-ramp and perhaps doesn't even refer to itself as a wallet but more as a key to Web3 to really help push DApps into the mainstream. \n\nIncreasingly we will start to see startups cropping up worldwide in various industries focusing on leveraging DeFi technologies to verticalise and fine-tune the experience for different audiences with different financial preferences. The technology behind many of the most popular DeFi protocols is optimised for scale, performance and reliability, so there is a wide-open opportunity for startups to come into specific geographies such as developing economies, where debt financing for small businesses is harder to come by, and build a straightforward front end. This front end could then automatically tap into the sea of open-source protocols and liquidity that is readily available. It could then focus on making it accessible to non-crypto-native audiences with seamless on-ramps for Fiat which, in the future, could allow someone in Venezuela to take out a loan using stablecoins on [AAVE](http://aave.com/) using an [L2 solution like Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) without ever noticing that they have done all of this on a trustless and decentralised back end. \n\nIdeally, customers would eventually be aware of the fact that they are interacting with DeFi, but in order to reach a truly mainstream audience there will be a transitionary period where perhaps these front ends do not lean too heavily into the crypto angle. This movement comes straight out of the playbook of new Fintech startups like [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) and [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/) that have spent the past decade taking complex financial systems, reducing their complexity and making them accessible to retail investors. These startups often build on top of TradFi and reduce friction for retail users by bending the rules or by [bundling transactions together](https://www.freetrade.io). DeFi could use the same approach and reduce friction even further by abstracting away the complexities of the Ethereum blockchain and presenting a seamless solution to the end-user. It is unlikely that this simplified DeFi front end innovation will come from the existing Fintech incumbents because the way they are used to working is so different to the way DeFi works. TradFi Fintech startups are used to pushing up against and fighting the traditional systems to try and squeeze them into a user experience that is pleasant to use. The DeFi space is flexible by design so the approach taken by these verticalised DeFi gateways will be simple, and even encouraged by the protocols themselves, contrary to the struggles faced by TradFi Fintech startups where in this case the incumbent banks are constantly trying to play catch-up with the challenger Fintech startups . \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/619cb9ed-b108-46e9-af75-3b211568bb06.png?height=806&width=1825)\n\nWhile there will be many independent startups fulfilling this function and maybe even getting funded through the protocols' own grants DAOs, many of these usability improvements will also come from the protocols' own core teams, especially on the institutional side. Institutional TradFi, at least in the short term, tends to prefer interacting directly with the people that built the technology they are going to be leveraging. [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) has actually started experimenting with [permissioned pools for institutional investors](https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-lending-platform-aave-reveals-private-pool-for-institutions) because institutional investors previously found it tough to use the protocol due to lack of [KYC and AML](https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/kyc-aml-know-your-customer-vs-anti-money-laundering/) compliance, and this has allowed banks and other institutional clients using [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) to know that the other parties in the network are compliant and vetted not to be on an [OFAC sanctions list](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information). This is just another example of DeFi slightly adapting to TradFi without compromising on their core principles as an almost intermediate stage to mainstream adoption. Whether that be through making it feel like Fiat through stable-coins, or increasing KYC for institutions to help them to feel more at ease about the protocols they are transacting with, these measures all go a long way towards lowering hurdles to mass adoption. \n\nIt is also likely that whilst at this early stage the protocol teams themselves are working on the UI and UX as well as the underlying infrastructure, they may slowly start to shift their focus away from the consumer side and specialise more on the protocol itself. This would likely manifest itself in protocols keeping their existing UIs more as a reference with the aim of slowly phasing them out in the very long-term. Platforms like [Zapper](https://www.zapper.fi) and [Zerion](https://zerion.io/), which are focused almost exclusively on usability and accessibility, will then step in to focus on the front ends and leave the protocol teams free to optimise their platforms.\n\nThe runway is wide open, and the tech is ready. These protocols exist and are being built and tested by thousands of users every day. The best part is that anyone can come in and make them more useful to any specific demographic. Look no further than projects like [Ribbon](https://www.ribbon.finance) to see this in action. [Ribbon](htts://www.ribbon.finance) has made some sophisticated covered call strategies available to anyone with a [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io/) by building directly on [Opyn's](https://www.opyn.co/) cash-settled ETH options protocol, all while making it feel as simple as an, admittedly high-risk, savings account to the end-user.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0ec888-d3db-4856-af1d-48280478715d.png?height=851&width=2325)\n\n#### Undercolateralisation \n\nThe second hurdle is the issue of overcolateralisation in DeFi lending protocols. When you put the whole DeFi stack together, what you are left with is essentially a fully decentralised crypto bank that runs itself in the most traditional sense of the word. DeFi, just like a bank, allows you to convert between currencies, deposit money and receive interest in return for providing liquidity to the bank to then allow them to loan it back out. On the other side of the equation, anyone can then go to the bank, take out a loan and then pay it back at a rate most suited to their risk profile and time horizon. In TradFi some loans are unsecured, but many are secured in that they have some form of collateral backing the loan. If you fail to pay back said loan, the traditional bank has the legal authority to repossess that asset and liquidate it in exchange for cash. The percentage of the total loan required as collateral often depends on a credit score and past successful repayment of loans. Some traditional bank loans are overcollateralised when the asset is highly illiquid to make sure that enough cash can be recouped in the event of a loan default. Conversely in most DeFi lending protocols, you need to provide significantly more crypto as collateral than the stable-coins you are borrowing, sometimes as much as 700%.\n\nIt can be hard to understand why someone would ever want to take out a loan worth less than the amount they are putting down as collateral, and whilst there are some valid reasons for this such as delaying a taxable event or increasing leverage on positions through complex financial gymnastics, the vast majority of the world is **unwilling** or, more importantly, **unable** to borrow money in this way. \n\nThe main reason people borrow money is precisely because they do not have the spare capital available at that time. People take out mortgages to buy houses, or take out loans to start a small business in their hometown. Sometimes a mortgage may even start highly collateralised but later turn undercollateralised if the value of the house goes down, however due to the credit history of the borrower the loan is still able to remain a [_performing loan_](https://pocketsense.com/difference-between-performing-nonperforming-loans-12224160.html). The downside of undercollateralisation is of course that if the loan were to default, the collateral would not be able to cover the principal. In this case, the borrower would step in to cover the difference if they are in fact creditworthy and have some reputational skin in the game not to run off with the money with no consequence. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/17b662fe-a9af-4b5c-afda-aeb07b88e131.png?height=845&width=2138)\n\nTo cater properly to these kinds of users it is important that DeFi eventually gets to a point where loans can be undercollateralised in some way. The difficulty is that DeFi is by its very nature anonymous and trustless, which means that the concept of social proof and credit scores becomes very difficult to handle and potentially even ideologically problematic. A potential solution could be a quasi-anonymous loan passport solution in which the user is anonymous on one dimension but not on another, i.e. their wallet address is public, but the owner of the wallet is not. One could, in theory, understand someone's creditworthiness through their DeFi loans history, which is of course publicly visible on Web3 or even decrease the user's collateral requirement for their next loan by a certain percentage every time they repay successfully. Another alternative is allowing user loans to be secured and guaranteed by other individuals they know in real life that trust the borrower enough to guarantee their loan and [delegate their credit](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/credit-delegation). \n\nPerhaps we could even see some CeFi institutions step in to perform credit checks on DeFi users on a per address basis. This solution would, of course, introduce some centralisation as it would involve real-identity based KYC, but may be a necessary interim solution for users that prioritise a low collateral ratio over absolute anonymity as lending protocols could eventually introduce pools of loans where a trusted third party has verified creditworthiness in advance. This CeFi verification could also be a [Zero Knowledge Proof](https://www.wired.com/story/zero-knowledge-proofs/), in that the verifying party would know that the borrower is creditworthy but would essentially allow the borrowers to prove their creditworthiness to another party without having to reveal their identity. When the borrower proves their creditworthiness with zero knowledge, they would display the fact that the CeFi institution has deemed them creditworthy as a boolean value in their wallet, perhaps as a non-transferrable NFT.\n\nThere are already some great projects being built in this space like [teller.finance](https://www.teller.finance/) which is taking a similar approach by connecting to your bank account through [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) and then offering risk-assessed DeFi loans on their platform without the need for collateral.

[AAVE](https://www.aave.com) has actually started experimenting with [permissioned pools for institutional investors](https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-lending-platform-aave-reveals-private-pool-for-institutions) because institutional investors previously found it tough to use the protocol due to lack of [KYC and AML](https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/kyc-aml-know-your-customer-vs-anti-money-laundering/) compliance, and this has allowed banks and other institutional clients using [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) to know that the other parties in the network are compliant and vetted not to be on an [OFAC sanctions list](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information). This is just another example of DeFi slightly adapting to TradFi without compromising on their core principles as an almost intermediate stage to mainstream adoption. Whether that be through making it feel like Fiat through stable-coins, or increasing KYC for institutions to help them to feel more at ease about the protocols they are transacting with, these measures all go a long way towards lowering hurdles to mass adoption. \n\nIt is also likely that whilst at this early stage the protocol teams themselves are working on the UI and UX as well as the underlying infrastructure, they may slowly start to shift their focus away from the consumer side and specialise more on the protocol itself. This would likely manifest itself in protocols keeping their existing UIs more as a reference with the aim of slowly phasing them out in the very long-term. Platforms like [Zapper](https://www.zapper.fi) and [Zerion](https://zerion.io/), which are focused almost exclusively on usability and accessibility, will then step in to focus on the front ends and leave the protocol teams free to optimise their platforms.\n\nThe runway is wide open, and the tech is ready. These protocols exist and are being built and tested by thousands of users every day. The best part is that anyone can come in and make them more useful to any specific demographic. Look no further than projects like [Ribbon](https://www.ribbon.finance) to see this in action. [Ribbon](htts://www.ribbon.finance) has made some sophisticated covered call strategies available to anyone with a [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io/) by building directly on [Opyn's](https://www.opyn.co/) cash-settled ETH options protocol, all while making it feel as simple as an, admittedly high-risk, savings account to the end-user.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0ec888-d3db-4856-af1d-48280478715d.png?height=851&width=2325)\n\n#### Undercolateralisation \n\nThe second hurdle is the issue of overcolateralisation in DeFi lending protocols. When you put the whole DeFi stack together, what you are left with is essentially a fully decentralised crypto bank that runs itself in the most traditional sense of the word. DeFi, just like a bank, allows you to convert between currencies, deposit money and receive interest in return for providing liquidity to the bank to then allow them to loan it back out. On the other side of the equation, anyone can then go to the bank, take out a loan and then pay it back at a rate most suited to their risk profile and time horizon. In TradFi some loans are unsecured, but many are secured in that they have some form of collateral backing the loan. If you fail to pay back said loan, the traditional bank has the legal authority to repossess that asset and liquidate it in exchange for cash. The percentage of the total loan required as collateral often depends on a credit score and past successful repayment of loans. Some traditional bank loans are overcollateralised when the asset is highly illiquid to make sure that enough cash can be recouped in the event of a loan default. Conversely in most DeFi lending protocols, you need to provide significantly more crypto as collateral than the stable-coins you are borrowing, sometimes as much as 700%.\n\nIt can be hard to understand why someone would ever want to take out a loan worth less than the amount they are putting down as collateral, and whilst there are some valid reasons for this such as delaying a taxable event or increasing leverage on positions through complex financial gymnastics, the vast majority of the world is **unwilling** or, more importantly, **unable** to borrow money in this way. \n\nThe main reason people borrow money is precisely because they do not have the spare capital available at that time. People take out mortgages to buy houses, or take out loans to start a small business in their hometown. Sometimes a mortgage may even start highly collateralised but later turn undercollateralised if the value of the house goes down, however due to the credit history of the borrower the loan is still able to remain a [_performing loan_](https://pocketsense.com/difference-between-performing-nonperforming-loans-12224160.html). The downside of undercollateralisation is of course that if the loan were to default, the collateral would not be able to cover the principal. In this case, the borrower would step in to cover the difference if they are in fact creditworthy and have some reputational skin in the game not to run off with the money with no consequence. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/17b662fe-a9af-4b5c-afda-aeb07b88e131.png?height=845&width=2138)\n\nTo cater properly to these kinds of users it is important that DeFi eventually gets to a point where loans can be undercollateralised in some way. The difficulty is that DeFi is by its very nature anonymous and trustless, which means that the concept of social proof and credit scores becomes very difficult to handle and potentially even ideologically problematic. A potential solution could be a quasi-anonymous loan passport solution in which the user is anonymous on one dimension but not on another, i.e. their wallet address is public, but the owner of the wallet is not. One could, in theory, understand someone's creditworthiness through their DeFi loans history, which is of course publicly visible on Web3 or even decrease the user's collateral requirement for their next loan by a certain percentage every time they repay successfully. Another alternative is allowing user loans to be secured and guaranteed by other individuals they know in real life that trust the borrower enough to guarantee their loan and [delegate their credit](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/credit-delegation).\n\nPerhaps we could even see some CeFi institutions step in to perform credit checks on DeFi users on a per address basis. This solution would, of course, introduce some centralisation as it would involve real-identity based KYC, but may be a necessary interim solution for users that prioritise a low collateral ratio over absolute anonymity as lending protocols could eventually introduce pools of loans where a trusted third party has verified creditworthiness in advance. This CeFi verification could also be a [Zero Knowledge Proof](https://www.wired.com/story/zero-knowledge-proofs/), in that the verifying party would know that the borrower is creditworthy but would essentially allow the borrowers to prove their creditworthiness to another party without having to reveal their identity. When the borrower proves their creditworthiness with zero knowledge, they would display the fact that the CeFi institution has deemed them creditworthy as a boolean value in their wallet, perhaps as a non-transferrable NFT.\n\nThere are already some great projects being built in this space like [teller.finance](https://www.teller.finance/) which is taking a similar approach to the aforementioned CeFi integration by connecting to your bank account through [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) and then offering risk-assessed DeFi loans on their platform without the need for collateral. Although we are still a while away from a foolproof creditworthiness checker solution in DeFi there are many different approaches one can take and I believe a combination of these approaches will play a large part in solving the issue of collateralisation in the quest for widespread adoption.\n\nAside from lending protocols, there is also a significant level of overcollateralisation across the whole DeFi universe which was initially there for the sake of simplicity including in options protocols. Opyn has done some research into [increasing the collateral efficiency of their protocol](https://medium.com/opyn/partially-collateralized-options-now-in-defi-b9d223eb3f4d) to allow for partial collateralisation without having to worry about creditworthiness through strategic liquidations with a \"shock buffer\" of a size large enough to withstand a Black Thursday event.\n\n#### Understability\n\nThe final hurdle that, depending on how you look at things could be the hardest or easiest of these to solve, is the difficulty around understandability and education. This hurdle may ultimately solve itself if the first two issues are solved and DeFi starts to resemble the way in which users are used to dealing with and thinking about finances. However, it is still important to acknowledge that for non-technical people, the DeFi space can be very opaque and consequently more difficult to trust.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/46fc773f-114b-42c0-b1db-eade3492e306.png?height=697&width=2015)\n\nFiat money and the way centralised traditional financial systems work is deeply ingrained in our culture and is a little easier to properly comprehend because many parts of the system rely on trust and simple written agreements which come together to form financial systems. Understanding the way these systems work in DeFi is a lot less straightforward. While in TradFi it is relatively straightforward to explain the basics of how a bank works, in that one can deposit money, and in return the bank lends that money out and pays interest for that privilege. There are very few parts of that process that are opaque because, ultimately, it just involves numbers moving from one spreadsheet to another.\n\nThe difference with DeFi is that you first have to feel comfortable with the concept of decentralisation, anonymity, trustless systems, distributed ledgers, and then you have to try and explain how all of this functions automatically through smart-contracts. There are many parts of DeFi that have to be hand-waved away and perhaps this could become a hindrance to trust. \n\nOne could also, of course, argue that many people implicitly trust the banking system because enough other trusted people do and not because they understand every part of the process. The same could eventually be true when enough knowledgeable people trust DeFi and understand a good enough percentage of the current information gaps. \n\nThere are some great resources out there like [Finematics](https://finematics.com/) and [Bankless](https://banklesshq.com/) doing amazing things in the education space and teaching newcomers about all things DeFi. This will be crucial in making sure people are comfortable enough with the technology to use it, especially when currently decentralisation slightly goes against the grain and users may be met with scepticism from friends and family. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/56920551-f6e6-47ad-b44d-493b815bc264.png?height=589&width=1262)\n\nIt should, however, be noted that the younger digital-native generation finds the concept of digital money extremely intuitive as they have grown up interacting with various in-game currencies, and the youngest among them have potentially never even used physical cash in their lives. This will undoubtedly make the proliferation of DeFi a more natural process as Gen-Z is starting to trust the digital world more than physical and may even start to learn about finance through DeFi in context rather than adapting antiquated financial concepts to fit the DeFi world as in the current status-quo.\n\n\n\nOverall the space is going in all the right directions. It will take a while for these ideas to materialise fully, but this is the part that interests me the most about the DeFi space. There is so much mind-blowing R&D going on every day, and people are experimenting, taking risks and breaking boundaries. I'm very passionate about making sure as many people as possible have access to these tools and can take part in the revolution. Understanding the pieces of the puzzle left to fill will become increasingly important as the protocols we rely on are built out and refined and start to look towards the next steps.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this piece 💙 \n\nIf you enjoyed the piece and are interested in receiving more of my content or keeping up to date with anything else I get up to a follow on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/coconidodev) would be great... or if you're more of an email person that works too - **subscribe to my infrequent mailing list** via the link below.", "timestamp": 1623839517, "digest": "klQF-dVD9TOVI288YuTObvBVY5_GsrmBGDunRoWpYt8", "contributor": "0xcde3725B25D6d9bC78CF0941cC15Fd9710c764b9"}

The space has you covered for anything ranging from [peer-to-protocol lending protocols](https://aave.com/) to [insurance policies that protect users from loss of funds due to protocol bugs](https://nexusmutual.io/). Derivative protocols like [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) have you covered for any investments in non ETH-based assets, and you need look no further than [Opyn](https://www.opyn.co/) for all your cash-settled options trading needs. \n\nThe space is quickly starting to resemble a fully functional financial system, with all the applications and systems needed for standard retail investor transactions established and regularly audited, but also the most niche structured products thriving and innovating further with every passing day. \n\nHowever, the most striking difference is that DeFi is trying to do what TradFi (Traditional Finance) did over the past 2,000 years in just a couple of years. This pace of innovation is in large part aided by the true and native [composability](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-true-power-of-defi-composability-14fe8355e0d0#:~:text=Composability%2C%20in%20DeFi%2C%20is%20the,and%20therefore%20each%20other's%20utility.) of DeFi which allows projects to seamlessly integrate with each other like Lego and create mind-blowing synergies. DeFi is well on its way to catching up to TradFi in terms of functionality and has its eyes set on surpassing it as soon as the mainstream is ready. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6d974fc1-8031-47f3-9f5b-4bda5509abc9.png?height=700&width=1801)\n\nThe future is bright for DeFi, and the space is always vibrant and full of energy, no matter the state of the overall crypto market. We are still a while away from widespread adoption of DeFi, and as many people often say, *we are still early*. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), the most popular chrome extension based wallet used to interact with DeFi, only recently reached 5 million monthly active users. Mainstream adoption too soon would potentially come at the wrong time for DeFi as the applications may not be properly optimised to support the large and sudden influx of users, but I have had a lot of time to think about this problem lately and have come to some conclusions about what I believe are the main hurdles DeFi needs to surpass before it is truly ready for the *mainnet* to hit the *mainstream*.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/76a440fa-1ae5-443a-97fd-356ebd1a0f25.png?height=848&width=2152)\n\nI call these hurdles **the Three \"U\"s of DeFi Ubiquity**.\n\n#### Usability\n\nThe first, and arguably most important of these hurdles to ubiquity, is usability. Many of the most successful DeFi protocols are advanced, regularly audited and professionally run but have user interfaces that are unapproachable to all but the most sophisticated investors. In reality, the underlying service these protocols are offering is groundbreaking in the quest for the democratisation of many of the world's most powerful financial instruments which were previously unavailable to most retail investors. Consequently it is important that the people set to benefit the most from this democratisation are also able to understand and use these tools without having to resort to financial advisors.\n\nThe key to this issue is going to be knowing which parts of the UI to hide, and which to display prominently. [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) is one of the market leaders in keeping its UI simple yet powerful. Still, there will eventually be a divergence of the consumer level interfaces and pro-level interfaces using the same backend, a bit like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) vs [Coinbase **Pro**](https://pro.coinbase.com) to really drive this point home. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) does not focus greatly on UI refinement at the moment, but it will take a [beginner-friendly browser wallet](https://rainbow.me) that has a good fiat on-ramp and perhaps doesn't even refer to itself as a wallet but more as a key to Web3 to really help push DApps into the mainstream. \n\nIncreasingly we will start to see startups cropping up worldwide in various industries focusing on leveraging DeFi technologies to verticalise and fine-tune the experience for different audiences with different financial preferences. The technology behind many of the most popular DeFi protocols is optimised for scale, performance and reliability, so there is a wide-open opportunity for startups to come into specific geographies such as developing economies, where debt financing for small businesses is harder to come by, and build a straightforward front end. This front end could then automatically tap into the sea of open-source protocols and liquidity that is readily available. It could then focus on making it accessible to non-crypto-native audiences with seamless on-ramps for Fiat which, in the future, could allow someone in Venezuela to take out a loan using stablecoins on [AAVE](http://aave.com/) using an [L2 solution like Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) without ever noticing that they have done all of this on a trustless and decentralised back end. \n\nIdeally, customers would eventually be aware of the fact that they are interacting with DeFi, but in order to reach a truly mainstream audience there will be a transitionary period where perhaps these front ends do not lean too heavily into the crypto angle. This movement comes straight out of the playbook of new Fintech startups like [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) and [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/) that have spent the past decade taking complex financial systems, reducing their complexity and making them accessible to retail investors. These startups often build on top of TradFi and reduce friction for retail users by bending the rules or by [bundling transactions together](https://www.freetrade.io). DeFi could use the same approach and reduce friction even further by abstracting away the complexities of the Ethereum blockchain and presenting a seamless solution to the end-user. It is unlikely that this simplified DeFi front end innovation will come from the existing Fintech incumbents because the way they are used to working is so different to the way DeFi works. TradFi Fintech startups are used to pushing up against and fighting the traditional systems to try and squeeze them into a user experience that is pleasant to use. The DeFi space is flexible by design so the approach taken by these verticalised DeFi gateways will be simple, and even encouraged by the protocols themselves, contrary to the struggles faced by TradFi Fintech startups where in this case the incumbent banks are constantly trying to play catch-up with the challenger Fintech startups . \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/619cb9ed-b108-46e9-af75-3b211568bb06.png?height=806&width=1825)\n\nWhile there will be many independent startups fulfilling this function and maybe even getting funded through the protocols' own grants DAOs, many of these usability improvements will also come from the protocols' own core teams, especially on the institutional side.

{"id": "NHPes7bKkl-TVEB20zGq7MAbYyc_vqLMeuYpoJkHFKs", "title": "How Identity Emerges in Crypto Networks", "body": "We construct self-identity as a necessary part of existing in a social world. We share life stories with each other, and cultivate associations on the basis of the shared beliefs and values that these stories convey. These, in turn, help us to negotiate norms and moral standards that create functional societies.\n\nToday, with 75% of young people spending almost all of their time online, a portion of our identity construction process has moved to the social web, resulting in modern-era digital identities that are independent of nation states.\n\nSimilarly to how state-issued identities allowed citizens to work and live in urban environments, these corporation-issued web identities have allowed users to log in and use online services - such as media streaming via YouTube, or mobile payments via Venmo.\n\nBut the centralization inherent in the storage and control of these identities presents numerous challenges, including exponential security risks, and an artificial and reductive social identity siloed in corporate platforms.\n\nIn a separate vein of the internet, the decentralization of value in the form of blockchain-based digital assets - including stablecoins, community tokens, and NFT artworks - have exploded in popularity. \n\nThe blockchain technology underlying this movement has mainly been used for public financial accounting of these assets; as peer-to-peer \"ledgers\" that enable financial transactions without an intermediary. Its primary strengths are censorship resistance and guaranteed execution.\n\nBut a public ledger also implies an accessible, auditable, temporally ordered record of interactions among users - including interactions such as purchasing art, or lending currency. Analysis of the contents of these ledgers invites narrative generation and births a new crypto-economic sociology. Identity, understood as *what is known* about us by others, can be represented and explored through information stored on blockchains. \n\nI hold that relevant scholarly disciplines guide us towards a conception of individuality that is represented well on blockchains, and that blockchains are already expanding, formalizing, and protecting our identities in a socially progressive way.\n\nI explain how on-chain \"intersectional identity\" can be constructed from token ownership networks that reveal group affiliation, and how to view NFTs as cultural objects with shared significance.\n\nI leave out the fact that many systemic problems observed in social media, including [political polarization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bu5l9HREZE), security threats, and other malicious personal attacks, may be mitigated by the increased use of pseudonymous digital identities provided by default on these networks. I also avoid specific implementations for on-chain identity.\n\nFinally, I am not a proponent of \"identity protocols\", but as this post suggests, I view identity as an emergent property of interconnected crypto networks and the activity on them.\n\n## **Intersectional Identity**\n\nThe concept of individuality as the intersection of a person's group affiliations and interests [dates to the beginnings of social science](https://research.bangor.ac.uk/portal/files/13878843/2016_Intersectional_individuality.pdf), when it was formulated by German-Jewish philosopher and psychologist, Moritz Lazarus, and carried on by intellectual heirs such as Georg Simmel and Charles Cooley.\n\nThese early writers argued that modernity was characterized by a more diversified life; that the mind of a person has greater variety of interests, affiliation, and personal projects than ever before. They imagined these affiliations and interests as a system of coordinates, with each additional group determining one's individuality more exactly.\n\n> \"A man may be regarded as the point of intersection of an indefinite number of circles representing social groups\"\n- Cooley, Human Nature and the Social Order (1922)\n\nCooley specifically [anticipated](https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Cooley/Cooley_1902/Cooley_1902e.html) that expanding individuality is connected with the \"growth of communication\". The blossoming of global communication networks on the internet has borne this out and given interested researchers in every field of study new tools for understanding what it is to be a social animal in a modern world:\n\n> ...beyond the fact that it is so immediately important in all of our lives, [the science of networks] cuts across fields: making sense of human networks draws on core concepts and studies from sociology, economics, math, physics, computer science, and anthropology.\n\n- Matthew Jackson, The Human Network (p. 10)\n\nIntersectional identity is a robust way to operationalize and understand identity, and the proliferation of digital networks has accelerated multidisciplinary research on this topic. As we will see, crypto network analysis deepens this field immensely, and opens it to more accessible and accurate study.\n\n### Problems with this View\n\nFor most of us, the freedom to create intersectional individuality has been achieved through progressive social movements. For example, first and second wave feminism in the United States expanded women's interests and affiliations through ownership of property, and integration with political and workplace groups. Other examples would include the Black Consciousness Movement in South Africa, and the Gay Rights Movement globally.\n\nLooking through an optimistic lens, modernity is a progressive march towards inclusivity, which implies more group affiliation - a broader social life - and hence more individuality. Glen Weyl and Zoë Hitzig (2018) [give a colorful example](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3306738) of this, in what they consider to be a fully self-actualized individual in a liberal society:\n\n> One [example] is the gay nephew of the former ultra-orthodox chief rabbi of State of Israel. He is deeply steeped in nearly ever Jewish theological tradition and is ordained as a conservative rabbi, but runs a “God-optional” shul and was thrown out of the conservative rabbinate for marrying a Jew to a non-Jew. He knows and incorporates into his sermons more social theory and sociology than most rabbis, yet his shul is driven primarily by the contributions of a wide range of artists who draw on ancient Jewish traditions from all over the world.\n\nBut when considered holistically, the increasing multiplicity of our identities has benefited those belonging to some affiliations while, on a relative basis, been exponentially detrimental to others.\n\nThe [dominant use of the term \"intersectionality\"](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142) in social science today (starting with [Crenshaw, 1992](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1229039)), builds a framework for understanding of how oppression, derived from the combination of our social identities, is not merely additive:\n\n> How one form of oppression is experienced is influenced by and influences how another form is experienced. An additive analysis treats the oppression of a Black woman in a society that is racist as well as sexist as if it were a further burden when, in fact, it is a different burden ... sexism and racism must be seen as interlocking, and not as piled upon each other \n- [Spelman 1988](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/204131/inessential-woman-by-elizabeth-v-spelman/)\n\n> The term intersectionality references the critical insight that race, class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, nation, ability, and age operate not as unitary, mutually exclusive entities, but as reciprocally constructing phenomena that in turn shape complex social inequalities.\n- [Collins, 2015](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142)\n\nThese \"reciprocally constructing phenomena\" that may empower one person with increasing self-actualization, burden others with exponentially debilitating oppression. The fact that this extends to digital life can be deduced *a priori*, but examples are easy to generate: women are *more* targeted online than in real life, because of reduced friction to do so. Hate-speech is easier to propagate due to the algorithmically-amplified virality of content from polarized online groups.\n\nWhile we don't have long-term evidence for the efficacy of crypto networks as a tool for social liberation yet, crypto networks are unique in that they promise participants a highly functional \"persistent pseudonymity\" that has protective functions. An account on these networks does not necessarily reveal a person's nominal offline identity, but also allows its holder to participate in economic activity and exhibit individuality (e.g. group affiliation and taste), while hiding any unbidden or personal attributes likely to lead to oppression (e.g. nationality, race, gender, sex, etc).\n\n![Renée Cox, Chillin' with Liberty displays a vibrant visual mix of identities, from that of the painful distant-historical, to the brave and forward-looking, and from the sexual to the militant.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d10d9a15-5c05-4020-be8f-bf0259c529f4.jpeg?height=857&width=600)\n\n## NFTs as Cultural Objects with Socio-Economic Networks\n\n> Minting a token is an enactment of authenticity, an ontological shift in the history of representation.\n\n- A line from [A Feminist Manifesta of the Blockchain](https://hyperallergic.com/639180/a-feminist-manifesta-of-the-blockchain/) by Claudia Hart\n\nTechnological innovation allow artists to create objects that produce new meanings, social relations, and reputations. Minting an NFT simultaneously creates art and its historical record, which allows us to explore these relations in a new way.\n\n### Technology and Economic Networks in the Construction of Identity\n\nIn *Beethoven and the Construction of Genius,* Tia Nora explains how the invention of the pianoforte was a determinant of Beethoven's success in his early days as a composer; the new sounds evoking a greater range of emotional responses in listeners. But DeNora also examined the social and economic networks that supported Beethoven in Vienna, providing insight into the origins of his identity as the genius we regard him to be today:\n\n> [DeNora] examines more closely than anyone else just which aristocrats supported Beethoven, where they were in the complex Austrian hierarchy, why they backed him, and how this affected aesthetic perceptions. Her study provides substantial insight into the interworking between musical creation and production and the social forces that shape them... \n- [Broyles (1995)](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/161449671.pdf)\n\nNFTs are a technology that allow artists, patrons, and collectors to express and secure ownership of digital goods on a public ledger, and in doing so reveals preferences among and within socio-economic networks. This grants us an unprecedented view into the cultural norms of digital communities. For example, [Charlotte Kent (2021)](https://hyperallergic.com/652667/how-women-artists-have-been-marginalized-in-the-blockchain-discourse/) implicitly alludes to *generalized social exchange* occurring within communities of NFT artists:\n\n> “One notable feature of artists using blockchain is their interest in buying art with the funds they receive...This community-oriented attitude is reminiscent of early feminist practices”\n\nNFTs also allow us to express value for community-oriented attitudes and collective narratives in a new way. An excellent example of is the sale of the NFT “Dreaming at Dusk” (2021), created by Itzel Yard ([ixshells](https://foundation.app/@ixshells)), for 500 ETH (~two million dollars at the time of auction, May 14). The NFT supports the Tor Project, which describes its mission as:\n\n> To advance human rights and freedoms by creating and deploying free and open source anonymity and privacy technologies, supporting their unrestricted availability and use, and furthering their scientific and popular understanding.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/35855)\n\nDreaming at Dusk was collected by a on-chain organization called PleasrDAO. We therefore have a metric that hypothetically assigns a cultural attitude to the PleasrDAO community - according to those values inherent in the Tor Project: human rights through open-source privacy technology. This would extend for any account that bid on the audition for this work, all publicly viewable on-chain. \n\nThe preference for art, expressed through bidding and collecting NFTs, can be a map for digital identity - for a community as well as an individual.\n\n### DAOs as Token-Driven Culture\n\nCulture can measured by embedded \"collective narratives\", expressed in a shared language (*schemas*) and knitted together in a consistent manner. These can produce moral norms (beliefs, attitudes, and values) that inform behavior. \n\n> People construct social reality via the development, transmission, and institutionalization of shared patterns of thinking across generations.\n\n- Measuring Culture (2020), p. 23\n\nShorn, Lotti & Hart (2019) articulate how blockchains enable the organic development of organizations that form shared consensus - conceived as a \"headless brand*\"*, in their iconic article, [Headless Brands](https://otherinter.net/web3/headless-brands/):\n\n> While brands have traditionally been planned and designed directly by corporations, the rise of networked media has challenged the coherence of centrally-managed brand identities. New blockchain-based decentralized organizations take this a step further by giving users financial incentive to spread brand narratives of their own...In this way, a brand operates as a consensus system, facilitating a consistent set of beliefs across people.\n\nBeyond brands, social communities in general are beginning to proliferate around tokens. Friends with Benefits is one such example, whereby the access to the community and its productive capacity is gated by ownership of the token, and holders of the token are financially incentivized to increase its value. Members are interdependent within the community, and work to make it better without any formal organizational hierarchy - bound only by their values:\n\n> Friends with Benefits started as a private Discord server populated by our favorite thinkers and has since evolved into a global community bound together by shared values, shared incentives ($FWB) and shared IRL + URL experiences\n\n- [Evolution of the FWB DAO](https://zhang.mirror.xyz/9sRa2kNDUpkWoQkWw67bJ8PczFyTSX8fotf7JOddxew) - Alex Zhang (2021)\n\nBlockchains allow for people to play new kinds of coordination games, empowered by shared narratives and enacted by a decentralized organization of users. The classic example of a DAO is Bitcoin, which incentivizes millions of people to add labor to the project (in the form of marketing, research, or software development), without formally employing a single person. Although DAOs might have a core development team, or individuals who can influence the DAO's participants, there is no executive board with special powers.\n\nAs the number of people \"working for\" these DAOs expands, it takes on grander proportions, as articulated in [DAOs, Democracy and Governance](http://merkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf), 2016, by Ralph C. Merkle:\n\n> Modern research into “the wisdom of crowds” provides new insights into how to combine the expertise of all participants without handing over control to “experts”. Combined with research on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), this allows us to design a new form of democracy which is more stable, less prone to erratic behavior, better able to meet the needs of its citizens, and which better uses the expertise of all its citizens to make high-quality decisions. We call this new form of democracy a DAO Democracy.\n\nTaken to its most grand proportion, is Balaji's idea of starting a \"Crypto Civilization\":\n\n[https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1269178671086006273?s=20](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1269178671086006273?s=20)\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis post begins to explain how individual identity, viewed as the intersection of our social affiliations and tastes, is an emergent property of blockchain interactions.

{"id": "EKx7MmLpmWCFC8s_vcKUrD63ttyGT9d5GrKap-vL05Q", "title": "How Identity Emerges in Crypto Networks", "body": "We construct self-identity as a necessary part of existing in a social world. We share life stories with each other, and cultivate associations on the basis of the shared beliefs and values that these stories convey. These, in turn, help us to negotiate norms and moral standards that create functional societies.\n\nToday, with 75% of young people spending almost all of their time online, a portion of our identity construction process has moved to the social web, resulting in modern-era digital identities that are independent of nation states.\n\nSimilarly to how state-issued identities allowed citizens to work and live in urban environments, these corporation-issued web identities have allowed users to log in and use online services - such as media streaming via YouTube, or mobile payments via Venmo.\n\nBut the centralization inherent in the storage and control of these identities presents numerous challenges, including exponential security risks, and an artificial and reductive social identity siloed in corporate platforms.\n\nIn a separate vein of the internet, the decentralization of value in the form of blockchain-based digital assets - including stablecoins, community tokens, and NFT artworks - have exploded in popularity. \n\nThe blockchain technology underlying this movement has mainly been used for public financial accounting of these assets; as peer-to-peer \"ledgers\" that enable financial transactions without an intermediary. Its primary strengths are censorship resistance and guaranteed execution.\n\nBut a public ledger also implies an accessible, auditable, temporally ordered record of interactions among users - including interactions such as purchasing art, or lending currency. Analysis of the contents of these ledgers invites narrative generation and births a new crypto-economic sociology. Identity, understood as *what is known* about us by others, can be represented and explored through information stored on blockchains. \n\nI hold that relevant scholarly disciplines guide us towards a conception of individuality that is represented well on blockchains, and that blockchains are already expanding, formalizing, and protecting our identities in a socially progressive way.\n\nI explain how on-chain \"intersectional identity\" can be constructed from token ownership networks that reveal group affiliation, and how to view NFTs as cultural objects with shared significance.\n\nI leave out the fact that many systemic problems observed in social media, including [political polarization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bu5l9HREZE), security threats, and other malicious personal attacks, may be mitigated by the increased use of pseudonymous digital identities provided by default on these networks. I also avoid specific implementations for on-chain identity.\n\nFinally, I am not a proponent of \"identity protocols\", but as this post suggests, I view identity as an emergent property of interconnected crypto networks and the activity on them.\n\n## **Intersectional Identity**\n\nThe concept of individuality as the intersection of a person's group affiliations and interests [dates to the beginnings of social science](https://research.bangor.ac.uk/portal/files/13878843/2016_Intersectional_individuality.pdf), when it was formulated by German-Jewish philosopher and psychologist, Moritz Lazarus, and carried on by intellectual heirs such as Georg Simmel and Charles Cooley.\n\nThese early writers argued that modernity was characterized by a more diversified life; that the mind of a person has greater variety of interests, affiliation, and personal projects than ever before. They imagined these affiliations and interests as a system of coordinates, with each additional group determining one's individuality more exactly.\n\n> \"A man may be regarded as the point of intersection of an indefinite number of circles representing social groups\"\n- Cooley, Human Nature and the Social Order (1922)\n\nCooley specifically [anticipated](https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Cooley/Cooley_1902/Cooley_1902e.html) that expanding individuality is connected with the \"growth of communication\". The blossoming of global communication networks on the internet has borne this out and given interested researchers in every field of study new tools for understanding what it is to be a social animal in a modern world:\n\n> ...beyond the fact that it is so immediately important in all of our lives, [the science of networks] cuts across fields: making sense of human networks draws on core concepts and studies from sociology, economics, math, physics, computer science, and anthropology.\n\n- Matthew Jackson, The Human Network (p. 10)\n\nIntersectional identity is a robust way to operationalize and understand identity, and the proliferation of digital networks has accelerated multidisciplinary research on this topic. As we will see, crypto network analysis deepens this field immensely, and opens it to more accessible and accurate study.\n\n### Problems with this View\n\nFor most of us, the freedom to create intersectional individuality has been achieved through progressive social movements. For example, first and second wave feminism in the United States expanded women's interests and affiliations through ownership of property, and integration with political and workplace groups. Other examples would include the Black Consciousness Movement in South Africa, and the Gay Rights Movement globally.\n\nLooking through an optimistic lens, modernity is a progressive march towards inclusivity, which implies more group affiliation - a broader social life - and hence more individuality. Glen Weyl and Zoë Hitzig (2018) [give a colorful example](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3306738) of this, in what they consider to be a fully self-actualized individual in a liberal society:\n\n> One [example] is the gay nephew of the former ultra-orthodox chief rabbi of State of Israel. He is deeply steeped in nearly ever Jewish theological tradition and is ordained as a conservative rabbi, but runs a “God-optional” shul and was thrown out of the conservative rabbinate for marrying a Jew to a non-Jew. He knows and incorporates into his sermons more social theory and sociology than most rabbis, yet his shul is driven primarily by the contributions of a wide range of artists who draw on ancient Jewish traditions from all over the world.\n\nBut when considered holistically, the increasing multiplicity of our identities has benefited those belonging to some affiliations while, on a relative basis, been exponentially detrimental to others.\n\nThe [dominant use of the term \"intersectionality\"](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142) in social science today (starting with [Crenshaw, 1992](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1229039)), builds a framework for understanding of how oppression, derived from the combination of our social identities, is not merely additive:\n\n> How one form of oppression is experienced is influenced by and influences how another form is experienced. An additive analysis treats the oppression of a Black woman in a society that is racist as well as sexist as if it were a further burden when, in fact, it is a different burden ... sexism and racism must be seen as interlocking, and not as piled upon each other \n- [Spelman 1988](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/204131/inessential-woman-by-elizabeth-v-spelman/)\n\n> The term intersectionality references the critical insight that race, class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, nation, ability, and age operate not as unitary, mutually exclusive entities, but as reciprocally constructing phenomena that in turn shape complex social inequalities.\n- [Collins, 2015](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142)\n\nThese \"reciprocally constructing phenomena\" that may empower one person with increasing self-actualization, burden others with exponentially debilitating oppression. The fact that this extends to digital life can be deduced *a priori*, but examples are easy to generate: women are *more* targeted online than in real life, because of reduced friction to do so. Hate-speech is easier to propagate due to the algorithmically-amplified virality of content from polarized online groups.\n\nWhile we don't have long-term evidence for the efficacy of crypto networks as a tool for social liberation yet, crypto networks are unique in that they promise participants a highly functional \"persistent pseudonymity\" that has protective functions. An account on these networks does not necessarily reveal a person's nominal offline identity, but also allows its holder to participate in economic activity and exhibit individuality (e.g. group affiliation and taste), while hiding any unbidden or personal attributes likely to lead to oppression (e.g. nationality, race, gender, sex, etc).\n\n![Renée Cox, Chillin' with Liberty displays a vibrant visual mix of identities, from that of the painful distant-historical, to the brave and forward-looking, and from the sexual to the militant.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d10d9a15-5c05-4020-be8f-bf0259c529f4.jpeg?height=857&width=600)\n\n## NFTs as Cultural Objects with Socio-Economic Networks\n\n> Minting a token is an enactment of authenticity, an ontological shift in the history of representation.\n\n- A line from [A Feminist Manifesta of the Blockchain](https://hyperallergic.com/639180/a-feminist-manifesta-of-the-blockchain/) by Claudia Hart\n\nTechnological innovation allows artists to create objects that produce new meanings, social relations, and reputations. Minting an NFT simultaneously creates art and its historical record, which allows us to explore these relations in a new way.\n\n### Technology and Economic Networks in the Construction of Identity\n\nIn *Beethoven and the Construction of Genius,* Tia Nora explains how the invention of the pianoforte was a determinant of Beethoven's success in his early days as a composer; the new sounds evoking a greater range of emotional responses in listeners. But DeNora also examined the social and economic networks that supported Beethoven in Vienna, providing insight into the origins of his identity as the genius we regard him to be today:\n\n> [DeNora] examines more closely than anyone else just which aristocrats supported Beethoven, where they were in the complex Austrian hierarchy, why they backed him, and how this affected aesthetic perceptions. Her study provides substantial insight into the interworking between musical creation and production and the social forces that shape them... \n- [Broyles (1995)](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/161449671.pdf)\n\nNFTs are a technology that allow artists, patrons, and collectors to express and secure ownership of digital goods on a public ledger, and in doing so reveals preferences among and within socio-economic networks. This grants us an unprecedented view into the cultural norms of digital communities. For example, [Charlotte Kent (2021)](https://hyperallergic.com/652667/how-women-artists-have-been-marginalized-in-the-blockchain-discourse/) implicitly alludes to *generalized social exchange* occurring within communities of NFT artists:\n\n> “One notable feature of artists using blockchain is their interest in buying art with the funds they receive...This community-oriented attitude is reminiscent of early feminist practices”\n\nNFTs also allow us to express value for community-oriented attitudes and collective narratives in a new way. An excellent example of is the sale of the NFT “Dreaming at Dusk” (2021), created by Itzel Yard ([ixshells](https://foundation.app/@ixshells)), for 500 ETH (~two million dollars at the time of auction, May 14). The NFT supports the Tor Project, which describes its mission as:\n\n> To advance human rights and freedoms by creating and deploying free and open source anonymity and privacy technologies, supporting their unrestricted availability and use, and furthering their scientific and popular understanding.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/35855)\n\nDreaming at Dusk was collected by a on-chain organization called PleasrDAO. We therefore have a metric that hypothetically assigns a cultural attitude to the PleasrDAO community - according to those values inherent in the Tor Project: human rights through open-source privacy technology. This would extend for any account that bid on the audition for this work, all publicly viewable on-chain. \n\nThe preference for art, expressed through bidding and collecting NFTs, can be a map for digital identity - for a community as well as an individual.\n\n### DAOs as Token-Driven Culture\n\nCulture can measured by embedded \"collective narratives\", expressed in a shared language (*schemas*) and knitted together in a consistent manner. These can produce moral norms (beliefs, attitudes, and values) that inform behavior. \n\n> People construct social reality via the development, transmission, and institutionalization of shared patterns of thinking across generations.\n\n- Measuring Culture (2020), p. 23\n\nShorn, Lotti & Hart (2019) articulate how blockchains enable the organic development of organizations that form shared consensus - conceived as a \"headless brand*\"*, in their iconic article, [Headless Brands](https://otherinter.net/web3/headless-brands/):\n\n> While brands have traditionally been planned and designed directly by corporations, the rise of networked media has challenged the coherence of centrally-managed brand identities. New blockchain-based decentralized organizations take this a step further by giving users financial incentive to spread brand narratives of their own...In this way, a brand operates as a consensus system, facilitating a consistent set of beliefs across people.\n\nBeyond brands, social communities in general are beginning to proliferate around tokens. Friends with Benefits is one such example, whereby the access to the community and its productive capacity is gated by ownership of the token, and holders of the token are financially incentivized to increase its value. Members are interdependent within the community, and work to make it better without any formal organizational hierarchy - bound only by their values:\n\n> Friends with Benefits started as a private Discord server populated by our favorite thinkers and has since evolved into a global community bound together by shared values, shared incentives ($FWB) and shared IRL + URL experiences\n\n- [Evolution of the FWB DAO](https://zhang.mirror.xyz/9sRa2kNDUpkWoQkWw67bJ8PczFyTSX8fotf7JOddxew) - Alex Zhang (2021)\n\nBlockchains allow for people to play new kinds of coordination games, empowered by shared narratives and enacted by a decentralized organization of users. The classic example of a DAO is Bitcoin, which incentivizes millions of people to add labor to the project (in the form of marketing, research, or software development), without formally employing a single person. Although DAOs might have a core development team, or individuals who can influence the DAO's participants, there is no executive board with special powers.\n\nAs the number of people \"working for\" these DAOs expands, it takes on grander proportions, as articulated in [DAOs, Democracy and Governance](http://merkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf), 2016, by Ralph C. Merkle:\n\n> Modern research into “the wisdom of crowds” provides new insights into how to combine the expertise of all participants without handing over control to “experts”.

{"id": "NwtMcvISVC871CHZgrjhpyjWhSprhPYe011yqEBLIfI", "title": "Keeping up in crypto", "body": "I've [written before](https://ls.mirror.xyz/v_AK57oyXtp8hLmtq7p7R8ZkMrqxXmtFQkaQjz_5xg4) about how crypto feels different than other industries I've worked in. I want to pull on a different facet of that thread. Today, I'm thinking through the challenges of 'keeping up' in crypto.\n\nIt's a common experience for those of us in this industry and it's a shame that it isn't put into words more frequently. It seems to come up in conversations with colleagues frequently, usually in the form of anxiety. There are *so many* things going on at all times in crypto. And it feels like the ground is constantly shifting; the base assumptions of how each layer of the 'stack' works are in flux.\n\nI think this is sorta what makes crypto crypto. The fact that the protocols we're building are transparent and permissionless to build on means that every edge of every system we're building is exposed to the world's ingenuity at all times. It's inevitable that a crypto ecosystem is constantly in flux relative to (say) a web app system or a piece of traditional financial infrastructure.\n\nIt's the price we pay for permissionlessness. And it'll ultimately be how (if?) crypto wins. The systems we work on evolve organically at a frightening pace. \n\nFortunately, many of us in this industry are here because \nwe're a little ADD so this constant flux is actually a good deal of the fun. But it can be overwhelming at times. I've been reflecting on my 'strategies' for dealing with the overwhelm.\n\n## humility\n\nFirst off, it's important to bring some amount of humility to one's interpretation of the industry. When I worked in Machine Learning, I felt like I had a pretty robust 'meta' model for how most research in the space interrelated. I had a graph structure in my head that connected the big ideas pretty consistently throughout my time there. In crypto, the graph changes much more frequently. Ideas in one area can (and should!) break assumptions in others and shift their relationships continuously. \n\nA recent example is the ['MEV'](https://research.paradigm.xyz/MEV) part of the crypto research graph. It's very rapidly become clear that research around MEV mitigation/democratization is crucial for many people in the smart contract protocol r&d stack to think about. It may be the case, for example, that the ideas being pioneered by groups like Flashbots end up making their way [into L1 protocols](https://ethresear.ch/t/proposer-block-builder-separation-friendly-fee-market-designs/9725).\n\nFor anyone building in the space adjacent to protocol decisions, it's crucial to have the flexibility of mind to incorporate developments like this. \n\nYou must have humility about the fact that there are always unknown unknowns that will change how you interpret the world. \n\n## network\n\nGiven that the world is constantly changing outside your head, it's important to have mechanisms that feed those changes to you on a regular cadence. The uninspired way to say this is 'have a good network'. \n\nI'll broaden that statement a little bit: make sure you're frequently exposed to great minds from different parts of the ecosystem.\n\nIn addition to having an ever-expanding reading backlog, I find myself scheduling 1:1s with folks I respect elsewhere in the space just to talk around the ideas we've been mulling over. Sometimes these conversations have a goal, but frequently the benefits come from thinking publicly about things happening in the space and honing in on incongruities in our language.\n\nThe language we use in casual conversation exposes mental models and assumptions more viscerally than well-prepared research posts. I find myself with lists of things to follow up on after most conversations with brains I respect. \n\nOne heuristic I think on a lot is [network centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality). Part of the game of succeeding in this ever-changing industry is maneuvering your position within the industry to be high centrality as the industry's network evolves.\n\n## time for rabbit holes\n\nIt takes effort and time to change your mind. More effort and more time if the assumptions you need to change are deeper in your mental abstraction stack. It's unlikely that your mental model will change to accommodate the changing assumptions of crypto unless you make that time and effort. \n\nYou need to make time to follow hunches that something is 'off' in the way you think about the industry. You need to have ample time on the explore side of the [explore/exploit tradeoff](https://conceptually.org/concepts/explore-or-exploit).\n\nFor me, this materializes as going down rabbit holes. I think of a 'rabbit hole' as an unstructured exploration of unknown idea territory. It feels fundamentally different from the time we spend doing things we planned to do. It requires openness and losing track of time. \n\nMany of us ended up in this industry because of a rabbit hole, so it's not that unfamiliar of an idea to fall down one. But it's important to *continuously* make time for rabbit holes given that the rules constantly change. \n\nI think I end up devoting 1 day every week or two for going down rabbit holes that have been in the back of my mind.\n\n## exploring strategies\n\nCrypto is an industry of unexplored strategies. As alluded to earlier, that's a big part of what makes it fun/meaningful for me! I'm going to use this channel to do more of that thinking (rather than just technical exposition). Let me know if it resonates so that I feel motivated to do so more frequently.\n\nI'm also trying to institute a more regular habit of longform content creation. Let's see if it sticks!", "timestamp": 1623872682, "digest": "wl5SPVidD0gX_xDV2s2RDtrz6Llp6sdTHR_DAMDjnrE", "contributor": "0xed625c9ABa1245Fa8e22eb1f1825881517A9DCE7"}

I emptied its contents onto my kitchen table and was faced by two inscrutable objects: a raw muslin handkerchief with the words “Happier Than Ever” embroidered in beige thread, and a card with white borders and an oddly printed beige background with brown script text “thank you for all of your support / can’t wait for you to hear what we’ve been working on / love billie” Why was I receiving such niceties from one of the world’s biggest pop stars? Probably not because I was stringing together thousands of words on the recent R.J. Cutler documentary *[The World’s A Little Blurry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7VHYBkCbF4)* and Billie Eilish’s distinct vibe. But probably because I had drunkenly purchased an oversized red sweatshirt with a large bikini-clad, winged anime angel named “Princess Blurry” on it for $120 a few weeks prior from her online merch store. The postcard remains on my fridge as I write this.\n\nIt would be a mistake to take the title of her forthcoming album at face value. Happier Than Ever is a sardonic effort to draw our attention to vibe above all else. Vibe has been the primary medium in Eilish’s construction of self, and while she has designated vibe as the fulcrum of her oeuvre, media coverage rarely does. A typical profile on Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell tends to break down to the following component parts: her young age (she’s only nineteen), her SoundCloud based ascent to stardom/virality (\"[Ocean Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viimfQi_pUw&feature=youtu.be)\", a song produced for a dance routine at fourteen), her deeply collaborative (at times unsettling) relationship with her brother, Finneas, their site of musical production (the O’Connell home in Highland Park, Los Angeles) and the core, foggily defined aspect that distinguishes her from a sea of high ponytailed, hyper-produced, competitively positive contemporary popular musicians — her vibe.\n\nThe psychiatric field distinguishes between mood disorders, anxiety disorders and personality disorders. Mood disorders, such as depression and bi-polar disorder, are characterized by emotional/arousal states that are distorted or inconsistent with circumstances. Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, avoidance and apprehension. Personality disorders such as borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder, are characterized by \"[long-term patterns of behavior and inner experiences that differ significantly from what is expected](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/personality-disorders/what-are-personality-disorders).\" Mood is something one is overcome by, not triggered by a single object or stimulus, but oftentimes by a complex constellation of inputs. Emotions can emerge from moods and/or contribute to moods - but the point is that moods are more simple in terms of valence (positive-negative) whereas emotions are often stimulus contingent (even if the stimulus is sometimes a mood itself). A mood has a more complex and elusive set of contributing factors, whereas an emotion can more readily be linked to an object. Mood what we feel, what we are overcome by, regardless of what we may think about it.\n\nEilish openly speaks about her experience of mood disorders —depression and its attendant suicidal tendencies feed heavily into her work. The particular varietal of depressive affect that is expressed through her voice is soft and dark, yet protective, which stands in stark contrast to her pop musical peers' belting to the point of vocal break. Rihanna-tic or Sia-esque belting intensities that escalate to full-on rupture, fissure, and crack—or Britney’s baby-esque, whiny fry—both perform vocalic self-harm. Whereas Eilish’s voice evokes a sense of bottoming out, a whisper that struggles to maintain its own presence. In *The World’s A Little Blurry*, Finneas directs Billie to sing in a “babier” voice, not in the self-harming Britney way, but in a way that communicates even further vulnerability and desire for care. All of this is expressed not only through lyrics but in the plush tenor of her voice that asymptotically approaches the brink of tears.\n\nHer voice emerges from a deep interiority, not as a reflection of the world, but as a product of an inner world. The latent resonance of Finneas’s bedroom—where Eilish’s albums are written and produced—permeates each song. \"[bad guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyDfgMOUjCI&feature=youtu.be)\"’s deep and rumbling introductory bassline is felt as much as it is heard. In \"[everything i wanted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgBJmlPo8Xw),\" the sound we hear is a response before identifying its stimulus—the introductory piano vibrates and side chains in reaction to an inaudible kick drum track. The opening vocals in \"[when the party’s over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbMwTqkKSps)\" convey the emotional tug of an oncoming sob. Eilish’s music triggers a physical response akin to ASMR—it is embodied, it is present, it is immanent.\n\nThe chill depressiveness, or downer haze ([Mark Fisher’s phrase](https://www.electronicbeats.net/started-from-the-bottom-mark-fisher-on-drakes-nothing-was-the-same/) for Drake’s breed of sadness), is countered by the physical intensity of her live performances. There, she does not perform self-harm through vocal breaks, but rather performs a physical expression of self harm through repeated corporal injury such as shin splints and sprained ankles. Eilish’s depressive mood is performed at an intensity high enough to function as mass pop music, but, unlike the intensity of EDM drops or Millennial whoops, her intensity is defined through the layering of sonic vibrations of a deep and low, rather than high-pitched register. It seems to erupt from the ground beneath. It’s mere shades from a brown note. She is singing at a 4 while performing—through movement, color and fashion—at 11. \n\nThe concrete elements of Eilish’s oeuvre—age, SoundCloud, Finneas, bedroom—are often discussed on equal footing to the mood engendered by her music, rather than addressing this high-intensity depressive affect as the overwhelming aspect that colors everything else. As we are seeing with the announcement of Happier Than Ever, a radical departure from the dominant tone of *When We All Fall Asleep…*, affect is at the core of Eilish’s work. Even with this shift, she retains an under girdle of depressive mood through her almost troll-y facial expression. Moods and their corresponding colors—Eilish has synesthesia after all—are how she has chosen to organize her young career.\n\n*The World’s A Little Blurry* is an object lesson on affect theory that centers these nuances in her work, all while meta-cinematically reproducing her vibe of depressive intensity in the structure and tone of the film itself. The bedroom setting, the chronology of depressive time—no past, no future, just overwhelming immediacy—are the stage and chronology to study affect and the greater vibe economy that Eilish trades in, bringing an otherwise inarticulable blur into sharp focus.\n\n[me to make you my art](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=6)\n\n## You Can Take The Girl Out of the Bedroom\n\nDuring the span of the film, Eilish engages in a wide, life-altering swath of activities from getting her driver’s license to recording her first album, touring internationally, performing at Coachella, and winning seven Grammys. Individually, any of these would serve as a substantial documentary subject, yet Cutler focuses in on the unifying affect, and how Billie herself is an advanced participant in the vibe economy. Eilish rose to fame on SoundCloud on the strength of a single, \"Ocean Eyes,\" which was created on her former a dance instructor’s prompt. Up until *When We All Fall Asleep*, Eilish had only released a series of bangers. This allows Cutler to document the interstitial phase between the initial ascent and the ensuing trajectory — he begins after his subject is established as a global sensation, but before the release of her first “official” album. Eilish is inarguably a phenomenon when the film starts. The album, then, is a bit of a bait and switch for legacy media to engage with her work, arriving at the conclusion that millions of fans already know. In *Blurry,* vibe replaces a chronology of achievement with a consistently calibrating sound, image, and overarching ambience. Privileging the communication of vibe over linear time aptly suits an auteur, in the sense of one who thrives when exercising total world-building control around a coherent collection of aesthetic and affect-oriented decisions.\n\nAs revealed in the film, Eilish was a true Belieber—perhaps the truest of them all. She participated in the cult of relatability made possible by early-stage social media. In her parasocial relationship with Bieber, she felt as if he spoke to her and only her. She projected an endless feedback loop of shared emotions, and became lovesick to the point where her mother, Maggie Baird, considered therapy for the tweenage affliction.  Baird says of Billie “I remember driving her to dance class and just thinking ‘How are we going to cope with this? How are we going to cope?’ She was LOVESICK, you know, just like, desperately in love with Justin Bieber.” Bieber’s conveyance of intimacy and relatability, when technologically mediated, created a global, ravenous fandom. While pop music has historically had this potential —Beatlemania, etc.—the scale and ability to participate in this collective mood on-demand, all the time, with the intimacy of social viewership—watching videos in bed, holding a screen in your hand—has amplified the sense of connection and personal investment. This parasocial projection of intimacy is a defining characteristic of the vibe economy. Vibe economies, unlike post-recession aspirational lifestyle commerce, result in collective identification — as opposed to atomized individual curation — à la being a Belieber.\n\nA fundamental aspect that Eilish and Bieber share is that they both were–Eilish still is—bedroom pop. Teenage (and formerly teenage) stars not only normalize the angst of being confined to one’s bedroom, but also professionalize that space. They conflate run-of-the-mill identify formation that occurs within the confines of those four walls with launching a global career. For Eilish, Bieber’s bedroom was a field of intimacy she had access to thanks to YouTube. Bedroom performances, whether they be musical or general vlogging, have become a canonical form to the extent that the necessities associated with this domestic site of production have become aesthetic elements in their own rights: multi-monitor setups, background art, wall decals, LED ring lights.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/629bee4f-ddb3-4eb9-a129-3caf77458643.png?height=968&width=1885)\n\nCutler, acknowledging the primacy of the domestic bedroom space in Eilish’s identity/career formation, takes the bedroom as a site of production and performance and transposes that intimate, enclosed space across planes, cars, and hotel rooms throughout the film. Billie exists in an expanded domestic arena—even when on stage she is often performing on top of a rigged bed, reminding everyone in both the concert and film’s audience — that wherever Billie goes, the bedroom goes with her. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4e22fc2-5cee-4b11-9a63-471ad2f8fd02.png?height=971&width=1649)\n\nFor the O’Connell children, the bedroom is a live-work space. Throughout the film we see Finneas at his work station while Billie sits on his bed, an arms-reach away. While Finneas’ bedroom might be the “studio,” Billie’s bedroom—like any teenage girls’ — is the site of construction for her identity and femininity.\n\nAs has been argued by a litany of feminist researchers, specifically as cited in Anita Harris’ work *Future Girl: Young Women in the Twenty-First Century* (2004), a young woman’s bedroom is a much more fundamental site of meaning-making than the street or (public arena). Because young women are generally more restricted to the home than young men, their bedrooms become private spaces to experiment with both dominant and alternative ideologies about what it means to be a young woman. All of this is blown out to another level when the bedroom becomes the broadcast point for an audience to witness what was, pre-social media and networked technologies, a private experience [1]. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e23ee493-685e-41a7-80de-b937b448a58a.png?height=969&width=1880)\n\nAt a particular moment in the film when we see Eilish Instagram Live from her bedroom with her pet tarantula, one specific feminine teenage subjectivity emerges — social celebrity and influencer. Not in the aspiration lifestyle sense, but in the e-girl sense. E-girls, loosely defined as a young person trading in internet aesthetics, projecting their youth, hotness, and vibe via Twitch, TikTok, Instagram or other social platforms, construct their digital personas in the privacy of their bedrooms. E-girl, a term originating to refer to young women in the gaming space, where they broadcast themselves, from their bedrooms, on Twitch, to a broader aesthetic category associated with TikTok. The bedroom’s privacy has long become public as it proliferates social platforms. Billie Eilish’s bedroom is an infiltrated private space, a nexus of production where the intimate goes global. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5efc4085-071b-491b-931c-3d5157acd4db.png?height=971&width=1885)\n\nCutler’s expanded bedroom becomes a chamber play set where Billie’s feminine identity formation takes place. On this stage, we see affective nuances and blurs take hold as a nascent subjectivity tests its roles and boundaries with others. We see these transposed bedrooms in car and plane interiors, hotel rooms, a tour bus at Coachella. Cutler boldly overlays text disclaiming whichever city or continent we’re in: Salt Lake City, New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Houston, Milan, Europe, Australia and the United States. Before almost every location title card, Cutler inserts a slow and solemn shot of Billie gazing sadly out a window or off into space—we witness interiority in transit. You can take the girl out of the bedroom but you can't take the bedroom out of the girl. We are given these indicators because very little of the exterior world is let in. No matter where we are, we’re in the bedroom.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0c0a5e2f-b0e0-4b23-8054-cf301283045c.png?height=912&width=1879)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eb17ff53-9be7-47e5-8874-fcfe8ca551a9.png?height=975&width=1881)\n\nIn one scene, Finneas’s bedroom is invaded by record label executives basically drooling as they hear \"i love you\" and \"my strange addiction\" for the first time. Billie—the only woman, and teenager at that—is clearly being objectified by all the older men in the room. There are many intentions present, some at odds with each other: in this moment Finneas is caught between needing to hype up record execs, while down-shifting his enthusiasm towards Billie. He has, after all, been charged with the covert task of making a hit without letting her know it. Billie, meanwhile, slouches on Finneas’s bed, looking fully disinterested in the executives. You can see their discomfort, being in a casual, domestic interior space with this young woman who is integral to their success. Affect is the liminal shimmers between individuals, it is the forces of impact between one subject and another [9]. We are witnessing the emotional and physical responses between each character, and it is uncomfortable as fuck, on every possible level. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9327cfb2-03f2-43e0-963f-e24bf546ade4.png?height=971&width=1883)\n\n[and i'm too far behind](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=8)\n\n## Vibe Economics  \n### Got a mood that you wish you could sell\n\nWhile at times awkward as fuck, affect can also be instrumentalized to create a sense of belonging and collective identity—see: hype beast culture. Eilish is both a consumer of hypebeast culture—as seen in her is repeatedly referenced personal sneaker collection—as well as a producer of it. Her branded merchandise operates on a drop cycle similar to Supreme and sells out at a similar speed. The “Princess Blurry” hoodie was only my second choice after realizing that all of her mom-themed merch was sold out. Social celebrity and streetwear exist at the point of intersection between lifestyle and vibe. Lifestyle—as expressed, curated and consumed on social media in it’s post-recession, aspirational iteration—is about object dependence. Lifestyle is an individually focused form of consumption that exists in the overlap between class and status, as [Max Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-component_theory_of_stratification) had it. While many individuals may be embodying or practicing a similar lifestyle, lifestyle does not lead to collective identification. Lifestyle plays out in an atomized society where the delineation between private and public space looms large and consumption differences between status groups stand in stark relief. While one kind of class identity describes a relationship to the means of production, status groups are just as often organized by reference to the means of consumption, that is, by lifestyle.  A consumer’s lifestyle—as laid out by writer [Daisy Alioto](https://www.whatislifestyle.com/)[2]—is a set of object relations, with attachments fueled by nostalgia, early memories and personal association. In contrast, products and experiences in the vibe economy are rooted in the present and often bleed into phenomenological or social experiences, for instance an immersive experience or standing in line with hundreds of people for hours.\n\nThe vibe economy is a collectively-oriented evolution in lifestyle— those that produce and purvey it manufacture scarcity, and one of the defining aspects is the viewing of consumer goods as investment assets where one can extract social capital or financial capital. Sneakers and apparel exist to be bought and resold via the entire experiential and pseudo-museuological culture complex that has formed around streetwear. What makes hypebeast culture different from the post-recession version of lifestyle as we know it is that aspirational, socially mediated lifestyle is about individual comparison and distinction, without an aspect of collective mood-making or participatory moments. \n\nThe hypebeast culture that Eilish plays in as both consumer and producer exemplifies the greater vibe economy, which includes elements of individualist lifestyle commerce while being based on participation and exchange. It is as much about buying the sneaker, posting it and reselling it as it is going out and standing in line. Producers in the vibe economy don’t solely make objects, they make experiences. In *Blurry* we see brief clips of Eilish’s immersive album experience that, as a giant wall text explains, aims to bring the album to life by recreating her embodied synesthetic experience. At the entrance of the experience is a Billie cardboard cutout with a projected head, wearing baggy red basketball shorts, black Jordans, and an oversized mobster Bugs Buggy t-shirt. The vibe here is produced by a constellation of signifiers and references, each of which, isolated, are individually complex, but collectively simple, as Peli Grietzer articulates in his influential [Theory of Vibe](https://www.glass-bead.org/article/a-theory-of-vibe/?lang=enview) [3]. “Simple” in this application can be explained as something which is immediately registered, and though potentially inarticulable, is felt and either phenomenologically or at some instinctive level understood.  In an interview, Eilish describes the experience as “an exhibit, a museum, a place to smell, hear and feel. Every room has a certain temperature, a certain feel, a certain color, a certain texture on the walls, a certain shape, a certain number…” All of these things may add up to a representation of a synesthetic’s experience of the world, but it also adds up to an aesthetic unity—it’s her vibe, and we’re all just living in it. When considered on a whole, this vibe is a curated set of objects and phenomena that make up the imaginative landscape of the work.  \n\nVibe economies are rooted in exchange, they are rhythmic and cyclical, as opposed to being aspirational and linear.  Lifestyle is primarily about mimesis, while the vibe economy becomes a stage for collective catharsis. Vibe currency is rooted in cultural lineages, vocabularies, and is community oriented. Oftentimes lifestyle products and services modulate individual emotions (e.g. Spotify “chill” playlist, a Dosist pen). These are primarily used in service of individual optimization, and to be consumed in a solo, rather than social environment. Vibe comes into play then these affects become socially relational. One can, of course, vibe out on their own. Vibing out alone most often occurs when an individual is in a dissociative, ketamine-esque state, conscious of how an external or disembodied eye might perceive them. Vibes only exist in as much as they are emitted by one subject and received by a real or imagined other. This relationality makes the vibe-based economy an arena where affective nuances can be witnessed and analyzed. \n\nCutler’s film focuses not on actions, but how Billie’s emotional expressions—how they take form through her speech, singing, styling and physical performance—play out and impact those around her. One such scene takes place during a late June performance at an open-air venue in NYC’s South Street Seaport, where a post-breakup Eilish sits cross-legged on a levitating bed frame with her brother. She sings “We fall apart as it gets dark/I'm in your arms in Central Park,” with the mic held close, choking back tears to reach the next repeated lines of “I love you’s.” Finneas reaches his arm around his sister in consolation, while Cutler cuts to the tear-streamed faces of a young female audience, who stand shoulder to shoulder, staring forward, singing in unison. The song is filled with broad-swathed emotional generalities that afford enough ambiguity to deeply resonate with each fan’s unique breed of sadness and longing. It’s not the content, but the mood that moves them. And the mood is not expressed solely through the music; the lighting design’s rich, dark hues, and even the unseasonably dour weather—[\"which was downright gloomy: dark, clammy, cloudy and threatening to rain at any second”](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://variety.com/2019/music/news/concert-review-billie-eilish-mesmerizes-new-york-audience-spooky-night-1203247285/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1623778387072000&usg=AOvVaw1qcOu268KP2t0LSbaq2IeC)—  aided in creating a gesamt-vibe work. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8f979149-df1a-43a1-a855-17f126dbb737.png?height=963&width=1878)\n\nThis scene’s audience is an ad hoc manifestation of collective desire and purpose. That purpose: a shared vibe, a sense of feeling seen by and belonging with others who are similarly afflicted with similar “non-productive” sad or depressive emotions. This cohesion is exemplary of a collective mood as described by Ludwig Fleck [4], wherein “the force which maintains the collective and unites its members is derived from the community of the collective mood. This mood produces the readiness for an identically directed perception, evaluation and use of what is perceived, i.e. a common thought-style.”  This collective mood can be defined by a unifying sadness, which to be clear is not unique to Eilish or her fandom. What makes Eilish’s affect unique is, again, the intensity of physical and stylistic performance, as well as the capacity —the malleability or augmentability—for how it’s received by an audience [5]. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/38b9d934-ed8e-4f5a-a0f4-eb36015e3df8.png?height=973&width=1879)\n\nHow does one differentiate the terms emotion, mood, vibe and affect? One defining aspect of contemporary vibes are that they are socially relational and only exist in as much as they are either expressed by one subject and received by another or generated through collective expressions of emotion or intent. Vibes are the excess of material reality, making them akin to a Benjaminian aura. They are not neutral, and if taken synonymously with Sianne Ngai’s definition of tone in Ugly Feelings, vibes can represent a subject’s ideology—and so, represent a structure of [a] subjectivity and touch upon the structure of the social-material conditions structuring [a] subjectivity [6].  Another way of understanding vibes, as they are produced in the receiver’s imaginative landscape and how that corresponds to a linguistically articulable material reality is to differentiate between dense vibes in the imaginative landscape associated with a work or person, where these dense vibes act as a structural representation a loose vibe of the collective objects and phenomena of a real-world domain.   Loose vibes emerge from curated sets of objects, elements, references, etc. and are received as dense vibes in an individual or collective imaginative, non-linguistic landscape. \n\nFor emotion, mood or affect, there are operational, discipline-specific, somewhat competing definitions across various fields that leave these distinctions in flux. Emotion is a mental response directly linked to neurophysiological stimuli—perceptions, memories, experiences, physical sensations—which is bucketed into conceptual categories that are, in themselves learned cultural objects, e.g. the 6 basic emotions: sadness, fear, anger, happiness, disgust, surprise. Emotions also emerge from any disruption in physical homeostasis, e.g. experiencing hanger, or coming down with a cold converging with a bout of depression. Neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett further explains this emotion/stimuli response as \"Your brain is always regulating and it’s always predicting what the sensations from your body are to try to figure out how much energy to expend. When those sensations are very intense, we typically use emotion concepts to make sense of those sensory inputs. We construct emotions\" [7].  Mood, very closely related to vibe, is not externally nor internally produced, but it rather arises out of the condition of being-in-the-world. Where vibe is relationally produced, and aesthetically oriented, a mood, or Heideggerian Stimmung, is the precondition for, and medium of all more specific operations of subjectivity [8].  This is differentiated from a pathologized definition of mood disorders, though has a commonality in that it is more than a literalist experience of given circumstances.\n\nWhat distinguishes affect in the context of Affect Theory and the philosophical discourse surrounding emotion and sociality from mood or emotion is its relationality (to the world) and interrelatedness (an embodied force that influences the mind). While emotion is the internalized, psychological sense, affect is a relational, psycho-biological sense that exists as the body experiences the world and comes into contact with other forces.  Distinguishing “affect” from pure “emotion” derives from Spinoza’s definition of the term, wherein affect is the shift produced in a body (including the mind) by an interaction with another body, which increases or diminishes the body’s power of activity, or potentia agendi. In Spinoza’s definition, affect designates the mode, state or quality of a body's relation to the world. \n\nAffect is produced at the point of interaction, transition, encounter and interrelatedness. It arises in the midst of in-between-ness: in the capacities to act and be acted upon. It is, in many ways, synonymous with forces of encounter. Because affect emerges out of muddy, unmediated interrelatedness and not in some dialectical reconciliation of cleanly oppositional elements or primary units, it makes easy compartmentalization give way to thresholds and tensions, blends and blurs.  The inherent between-ness and interstitial nature of affect makes it quite difficult to point to what, where and how these things occur and take form. \n\nAn affective-oriented cultural analysis includes emotions that have progressively left behind to unfold regimes of expression that are more concretely social such as crowd behaviors, contagions of feeling or matters of belonging. It shifts focus toward non-linguistic modalities, those that either do not or cannot have truly isomorphic relations to words. These are the unarticulated motivators which are not necessarily equivalent to impulse or instinct, but closer to them than explicit communication. Beyond sociality, they are also the operating system for contemporary consumer and financial capital. To put it bluntly, hypebeast culture, SPACs, crypto-markets, social media and other technologies that extract value from emotional engagement all operate in a sphere where affect is the medium. The mood is the message. \n\n[my limbs all froze](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=11)\n\n## More Than a Feeling\n\nCutler’s focus on the nuance of vibe surrounding Billie Eilish did not result in rave reviews. Those familiar with his oeuvre wondered why the critically acclaimed documentarian who had previously centered Bill Clinton and Anna Wintour now chose Eilish for a subject. Negative reviews focused on the film's lack of a center, its drawn out timeline, and the general lack of a “there” there. As Monica Castillo criticized, “the film itself can sometimes feel like it meanders off, squeezing in a random tour shot here, another scene of Eilish goofing off there. The core drama and story is there, but a few scenes don’t add to the narrative, only extend it\" [10].  The film makes more sense considered in the context of recent literary works which focus in on the inter-relational shimmers, the unspoken and unarticulated forces at play between individuals as they come into contact with one another and the world at large. One such work, Kathleen Stewart and Lauren Berlant’s recent book, The Hundreds, unpacks the unseen/unconscious processes inherent in a subject’s worldmaking. When viewed as a similar study, *Blurry* brings out the affective nuances that are taking place between Billie, her family, her fans, and the world. \n\nThis approach is strikingly different from the traditional music documentary genre camps. Music, especially pop music documentaries are seductively ham-fisted: they center around the recording of a specific song or album, tour, concert or festival—see D.A. Pennebaker’s *[Don’t Look Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1inL6s1htio&feature=youtu.be)* or The Maysel Brother’s *[Gimme Shelter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7UsBmavjsE&feature=youtu.be)*. These narrative frames provide a legible, linear timeline with distinct beginnings and ends. There are clear moments that allow for conflict to bloom—on the tour bus, in the recording studio—and successes or failures to be evaluated—the record goes platinum, the band breaks up. Cutler’s previous documentaries, *[The War Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgo-qwfCFYU)* (as producer) and *[The September Issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph7HLll8XmA)* follow the similarly linear timeline of a political campaign and magazine issue release respectively. \n\nA second approach is the more intimate, verité character study that takes a mercurial, what-will-they-do-next musician, and documents their alchemical, virtuosic creative practice— see Les Blank’s documentary about Leon Russell, [*A Poem is a Naked Person*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1D65LMlZiw). This study often goes one of two ways: either depicting a redemptive arc wherein a musician, stymied by various afflictions from songwriter’s block to mental illness, addiction, or the crushing weight of success, finds salvation through creation. Otherwise, the film becomes an exercise in schadenfreude, leading us down the spirals of one person’s private hellscape. Recent pop music documentaries have tended to follow this vérité format. [Katy Perry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVSXCphR6Ww&feature=youtu.be), [Lady Gaga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxI1iOi0t-c&feature=youtu.be), and [Arianna Grande](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHwcvnyiolA&feature=youtu.be)’s documentaries are singular character studies. They shy away from rooting these individuals within a broader community or cultural landscape, instead positioning them as singular pop subjects existing only in relation to themselves, their inner circles, their fans, and in a few cases, one another. This directorial tunnel vision operates in the lineage of romantic, virtuosic character studies, while creating a format that can, in equal footing, operate as an extended album release trailer or advertorial for the record labels that—in many cases—fund the film’s production. Partially or fully bank-rolled documentaries come off as spleen-less, neutered promos that communicate a siloed redemption without couching the narrative in a cultural context. They exist in an advertorial uncanny valley, as exemplified by Demi Lovato’s 2018 docuseries *Dancing With The Devil*, which balances reality-tv style confessionals with archival footage while the sponsoring CrossFit brand’s logo periodically glints across the screen. While Cutler’s film is legally authored by Interscope Records–a fact that we are reminded of at the end of the credits with the disclaimer “Interscope Records is the author of this cinematographic or audiovisual work.”– it does not pander to its corporate master. What *Blurry’s* negative reviews fail to grasp is that this film is in a sense a tone poem, where the wandering immersion into Billie’s world is necessary when neither the star herself nor her music are the “product” as much as is the aura surrounding them.\n\n*Blurry* is neither a tour, record nor concert film. It flows along an amorphous spatiotemporality, opting instead for a cinéma vérité approach that lets action unfold as it would unobserved. Cutler resists the genre's narrative tropes, primarily by transforming the directorial role into one of director-as-psychoanalyst. Over the course of the film, milestones take place—international concert and press tours, Coachella, the Grammys—but he utilizes his position to observe and listen as character-revealing insight (over action) unfolds. Through his lens, we view the O’Connell family as they create their own hierarchy of meaning, which is revealed through a version of cinematic talk therapy at both the individual and familial level. \n\nAs an analyst, Cutler is following the threads placed forth by his subjects—listening, following, and waiting for recurrent themes to emerge. As the audience, we are also trying to structure a hierarchy of our own attention. What is important? Possible options include: the oddly functional family dynamic, Billie and Finneas’s struggle to produce a banger that alienates absolutely no one, her disintegrating, dysfunctional relationship with her boyfriend Q, the physical injuries she sustains on tour, the matte black Dodge Challenger… *Blurry* is a sea of aspects that are only recognized in their importance after watching the entire film. Major or minor threads can only be determined once you’ve seen the whole of a subject’s investment in a theme. That is why the Challenger looms larger than the Grammys. It means more to Billie, in that it is a unique moment of differentiation and independence from the family unit, whereas the Grammy only further unifies it. The Challenger is hers (“mine”), the Grammy is theirs (“ours”). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7091d063-83ff-4cb9-9db2-73b88481a49a.png?height=969&width=1874)\n\nThis confusion over hierarchy of meaning is articulated by Billie in a particularly Brechtian moment. After a post-breakup concert in New York, she is ushered back into the public for a series of meet-and-greets with record label shills. Her Tourette Syndrome kicks in due to the high stress situation, she keeps trying to leave, and keeps being goaded back to her public. The morning after, she is riding in a van with her mother and team, and vents about a comment she received where a fan thought her rude the previous evening. She scolds her team, letting them know that they’ve failed her, and says, “Nobody tells me who’s important. All of you said I could go back and I hear ‘Billie, Billie, Billie, Billie.’ All I hear is “Billie,” so how am I supposed to know that’s an important ‘Billie’.” Well, Billie, we too are waiting to be told.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/945a9e2f-b272-4834-a5a8-7632e1b9f209.png?height=972&width=1877)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9f85e54a-72a8-449d-9ba8-ac52004eaadd.png?height=969&width=1881)\n\nThis psychoanalytic directorial approach and de-hierarchization of meaning is the foundational lens that positions *Blurry* as an object study in affect theory. This is furthered by the film’s interior, chamber play-like stage where affective encounters can take place within an expanded “bedroom,” as well as the fractured and extended use of a chronology that mirrors the futureless experience of depressive time.\n\n[the day you couldn't stay](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=12)\n\n## Always Already\n### But I (I) I'm in love (Love, love, love, love) With My Future\n\nAfter another one of *Blurry’s* bedroom moments at Coachella—where Billie has a brief intimate interlude with her withholding paramour, Q—she goes on to perform one of the largest concerts in her short life. Nerves abound as she waits backstage, watching the LED-screen backdrop glitch out. Fans yell “Fuck the screen” from the audience. Techs take too long to fix it, and Billie is told that she’ll have to cut two songs from her set. She is clearly distraught, leaving xanny by the wayside. We then see her performance start, with the screen still flickering behind her. She forgets words, she stumbles, and then she stops. The screen’s white light illuminates the stage behind her, and she directly addresses the crowd:\n\n> *“I just want us all to be in the moment for this song because I feel like in life we tend to do things then we’re always looking forward to the next thing and the next thing after that and we’re never thinking about what’s happening right now, and this is happening right now, this is crazy. And like, we and I, are never gonna be in this moment ever again no matter what, this exact moment right here. Never again. Ever. this is the only chance we get to be in the moment, so why don’t we be in the moment, yea?”*\n\nIn this moment, we too, the film’s audience, are thrust out of cinematic time and urged to root ourselves in the present—a present that is exactly sixty-seven minutes through the documentary. No man ever steps in the same river twice, Heraclitus said, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man. We have changed during the course of this film, and somewhere out there, so has Billie. This rootedness in the present, while apexed with this Brechtian aside, exists throughout the film. While the genre tends to heavily rely on archival footage, *Blurry* does not. There are brief clips from her childhood, dancing, singing, fanning out about Bieber, but Billie’s past does not play a central role. Her mother alludes to the family’s moments of precarity, but without divulging specifics. The film is largely devoid of anecdotes or nostalgia. There is an ahistorical nature to the film and its subjects, which feels mostly in service of a protestant efficiency above all else. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5c090ff7-d772-4847-ad12-2d33941d0962.png?height=968&width=1885)\n\nThe entirety of the film follows a loose linearity, marked with specific moments that indicate the forward movement of time. Billie gets her learner’s permit, then her license. Billie and Finneas record the album, release the album, and win Grammys. Everything in between feels interchangeable, and the lack of historicity, as well as the lack of articulation of future hopes and intentions, creates the sense of presence that is most directly articulated at Coachella. This mirrors the experience of depressive time, with its sense of foreshortened future and altered experience of temporal passage. The phenomenological experience of time for the depressive can often lack a clear vision of a future, often because of an overwhelming loss of life narrative or sense of general doomed-ness. This can sometimes be paired with a fixation on and inability to move beyond past traumas, if any “causation” can be rooted in a specific traumatic experience. This does not necessarily seem to be the case for Billie, at least based on what is divulged on camera. Throughout the film, we hear of her depression and self-harm—in one early scene she walks us through her journals, stating “I was in such a bad place. Wow… this page was kinda like the peak, I would say. I was like, fourteen-fifteen. I had razors hidden in places and I had bandaids hidden in a little corner of my room and I always had bandaids on my wrists. I was literally locking myself in the bathroom and making myself bleed because I thought I deserved it, you know?” Cutler then cuts to the drawings and text adorning her bedroom walls, with oozing ghoulish scribbles, and fragmentary statements like “an intense feeling of the absolute end / of a miserable state of mind and unenviable lifestyle / utterly dispirited or defected / the joy I had seems like somebody elses…”. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b0affe93-c0f6-40df-8538-1a7b0e6689e6.png?height=977&width=1886)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3737fdd5-f053-43f2-b09a-26390861b99b.png?height=971&width=1885)\n\nWhile our curiosity is piqued, and we might want to seek out a “why,” even though there is absolutely no need for depression to be linked to a specific traumatic instance, Maggie dissuades us with her explanation that depression is a condition of contemporary existence. She validates the trauma of Billie’s generation, born post 9/11, into a world of climate catastrophe, recession, etc. The mother is, in turn, defending her own trauma, which can be epigenetically linked to her daughter’s. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c9bfd834-5e93-4453-a010-befe369a3b33.png?height=972&width=1880)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/540d0f50-09eb-4b1b-9528-bf93f18b7762.jpeg?height=966&width=1878)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b00f13d4-61a3-4a1b-af5c-7dc07701a849.jpeg?height=968&width=1881)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8b49909c-50af-403b-b0ba-60484128df9b.png?height=970&width=1878)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5a185f58-f10d-40b9-a4be-3ba008f9926b.png?height=971&width=1881)\n\n## Sad Girls\n\nBillie Eilish’s depressive vibe and performance thereof exists in a long cultural lineage of sad girls. The sad girls currently dominating social media are young women expressing stylized aspects of sadness and depression, largely aestheticizing mental illness. This particular expression of (predominantly white) sad girl emerged around a decade ago, dominating early Tumblr and Instagram feeds, and converged with and was epitomized by Lana del Rey’s 2012 album Born to Die. Associated with pale colors and faded hues, sad girl aesthetics communicate a baby-ish vulnerability and need for care. It conflates sadness with taste, building out a fully formed world of visual references, limiting beauty standards, and aesthetics. Sad girl logic is not without politics, and positions the expression of sadness as an empowered position of protest to a heteronormative, brightsiding culture of toxic positivity. Lana’s sad girl marked a turn in popular culture, a turn away from what critical theorist Anita Harris defines as “can-do girls,” or “a unique category of girls who are self-assured, living lives lightly inflected but by no means driven by feminism . . . assuming they can have (or at least buy) it all.” The Spice Girls and girl power of the nineties are examples of such.  In contrast, Lana’s sadness refuses these expectations of the “empowered” can-do girl, with her traction suggesting a collective disaffection of—and resistance to—this mandate for productivity, ambition, assertiveness and independence. Lana, like Billie in some ways, embodies the “at risk” more than the “can-do” feminine subject, though while Lana plays as more of a doomed, caged bird, Billie reads as more of a disaffected youth who may need talking down from the proverbial or literal ledge. As sociologist Heather Mooney states in her essay Sad Girls and Carefree Black Girls: Affect, Race, (Dis)Possession, and Protest states, “Sad Girls are resistant to the affective hegemony of white girlhood, their protest follows familiar paths of white performance and becoming: commodification, ownership, and mobility/expansion\" [11].  Sad girl resistance is recuperated back into aestheticization and commodification. \n\nThough having peaked in the cultural zeitgeist over the past decade, sad girls did not emerge from a desaturated void in the beginning of the twenty-teens—like so many social media subjectivities, it is deeply appropriative.  \nThe sad girl typology originally emerged from Lantinx culture, prominently present in Billie’s neighborhood of Highland Park, Los Angeles. This ur-archetype was not in response to the liberated pressures of feminist empowerment, but rather a Catholic, male-led society that designates very specific, at times oppressive roles for women. It is a form of protest against often violent, patriarchal society. Billie’s form of sad girl conflates both the early twenty teens' iteration and its appropriative origins. Some of her stylings and aesthetic interests directly lift from Latinx sad girls—we see [Soto](https://shop.officialsoto.com/products/body-pillow-case)’s artwork in her bedroom—which makes contextual sense in that it’s the culture that surrounds her youth and home. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/15872630-ee65-42cf-b6bc-f48aa52d51f0.png?height=974&width=1885)\n\nWhile sad girl is a gendered archetype, Billie’s valence is also complicated by its reflection of a SoundCloud rapper sad boy typology as played out by Lil Peep or even Takeshi6x9. While Billie emerged from the same platform, these sad boys’ depression has been shaped by a very different breed of anguish: domestic violence, systemic racial injustice, and class-related white misery, all of which then resulted in self harm in the form of drug abuse and violence against themselves and others. While Eilish does not lay claim to any of these sad boy SoundCloud rappers’ trauma, her aesthetic is a hybridized version of LatinX Sad Girl, SoundCloud Sad Boy, and #pale Tumblr and Instagram Sad Girl.\n\nEilish’s sad girl positioning comes through in her choice of aesthetic partners. As mentioned, she is a fan of and has collaborated with the artist Soto, as well as working with notable sad girl photographer Petra Collins. Collins has earned this moniker through her photographic and filmic work that centers a hyper-feminine gaze, depicting young women in moody, dream-like colorscapes. Collins’ work trades in emotional vulnerability and depicts her subjects in moments of inward reflection, furthering the mystification of a young woman’s interior world. Collins’ aesthetic emerged from the pastel Tumblr iteration of sad girls, whereas Eilish, slightly younger and native to newer platforms such as Instagram, Soundcloud and TikTok, embodies a hybrid of the newer e-girl iteration of sad girl and its recent predecessors. Collins shot [Billie’s Rolling Stone cover](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/billie-eilish-cover-story-triumph-weird-863603/) with explicit intention to contrast her against the canonical [Britney Spears’ cute, happy, sexy teen-on-the-phone 1999 cover](https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/BritneySpears2.jpg?w=838). Eilish is shot in a non-descript bedroom, illuminated by light passing through venetian blinds. In the background a white stuffed bear floats in a fish tank. These moody, emo signifiers and oblique angles present a portrait of a feminine subject with an impenetrable, “you wouldn’t get it if you tried” interior monologue, which starkly contrasts Britney’s what you see is what you get cover.\n\nYoung women recognize themselves in Eilish, and teen girl sadness is a thread of the zeitgeist that is primed for performed empathy. The projection and centering of one’s own sadness increases authenticity and relatability and becomes a calling card for other young women to participate in the creation of an ad hoc community unified by a collective mood. Eilish and social celebrities such as fellow sad-girl [Emma](https://www.instagram.com/emmachamberlain/) [Chamberlain](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC78cxCAcp7JfQPgKxYdyGrg) have gained massive fandoms doing just this, and we see this collective mood take hold both in the comments of any social media post and as young women cry in the audience of Billie’s concerts. Billie’s music does not create a mood of sadness in the audience, it does not re-produce the affect in the viewer. That would be the emotional mimesis at the heart of kitsch. Rather, her expression of depression and sadness holds space for other young women feeling the same way to feel a sense of belonging and validation. \n\nWhen asked by an interviewer in the film about her choice to be transparent on “difficult” subjects like depression, Eilish states, “I never decided to. I never was like ‘I’m gonna talk about this, and I’m gonna talk about this,’ I just talked about what I was feeling and talked about why it was bad, or why it was good, or why it was whatever, and then it became this like ‘oh, she’s making a statement.’ Which I actually love, because I didn’t realize I was, and now that I think about it, like, I realize how many people aren’t talking about that kind of stuff and why people are so, like, shocked when you do talk about it. I’m like ‘why is that so shocking, like I’m telling you, like, about how I am as a human, like, why’s that weird? To be honest with you, I didn’t think I would make it to this age.” Eilish’s expression of sadness furthers her authenticity, and in her public reception, the public discussion of depression and self-harm makes her somewhat transgressive compared to other young female popstars operating at a similar stratum of fame.\n\nWhile Sad Girls toe the line between ennui, sadness, moodiness, and clinically recognized mental health issues, Billie takes it further. She is open about her experiences with cutting and self-harm. Songs such as everything i wanted directly address moments of contemplating suicide. Billie is definitely a sad girl, but each sad girl contains multitudes, and hers leans more towards a textured, low rumbling depression—reflected in the texture of her voice and sound—which is then inflected with bursts of wilding, raging tantrums—expressed through her physical motion, style and use of color.\n\n[it's dark enough](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=9)\n\n## Depressive Intensity\n### “I feel the dark things, I feel them very strongly”\n\nInteriority and a sense of immanence are integral to Billie’s vibe, which I define here as depressive intensity. The affect produced by her speaking and singing voice, her low-cast, disaffected gaze, and her open discussion of sadness and self harm compositely create a sense of dark, low-registered depressiveness. This is counterbalanced by a stylistically louder way of moving her body on stage and in the clothing she wears. While performing, she constantly jumps, both reflecting and producing the same motion with the crowd, and does so to the point of injury. It creates a sense of amplified depression, which does not spike, drop or whoop, but rather continues on the same low register, just with increased gain or volume. When listening to tonally low sounds at higher volume, you are able to hear more texture. With depressive intensity the medium itself is revealed— with decreased fidelity, you hear the substrate of sound itself. If you listen closely, you can even perceive the bedroom’s resonant echo.  \n\nDepressive intensity has specific affective valences within it which create the broader texture of this vibe. As her Rolling Stone cover title illustrates, Eilish’s success was claimed as the “Triumph of the Weird.” While Eilish trades in gothic, e-girl iconography—her pet tarantula, black liquid streaming from her eyes–it doesn’t not align with Mark Fisher’s definition of the term – “the weird is that which does not belong” [12]. In these terms the weird points towards wrongness—not that the thing itself is wrong, but rather our conception of the world cannot flex to accommodate it. Eilish, as a depressed young woman leaning into dark aesthetics is by no means wrong, it’s somewhat expected. By these parameters, I do not include weirdness as a component affect of depressive intensity. What I would consider integral elements are the affective categories of sad, chill and baby. Sad in these terms aligns with the previous description of the sad girl typology—a young female who capitalizes on traditionally non-productive attitudes, aesthetically flattening them into markers of taste. The breed of resistance apparent in Eilish’s sadness is not particularly anti-patriarchal, but rather against a culture of toxic positivity and brightsiding. \n\nRobin James has previously written about the chill aspects of Eilish’s work. She points out that “bad guy” may sound chill on the surface, but has other intentions at play. Eilish’s chillness is not simply a semi-jaded affect, but deepens a sense of intimacy with her audience. The laid-back chillness of creating hits in a bedroom with her brother, microphone close to the mouth, producing ASMR-inducing sounds, results in songs that tonally and texturally seem to be designed to be listened to by individuals on airpods. As James states, “Her voice is calibrated to suit the intensifying privatization of listening that has accompanied new media technologies and which has become central to neoliberalism’s imperative to produce capacity-value.” Capacity-value here can be described as one’s ability to fluidly adapt to a given situation, and what’s more chill than going with the flow. There is a darkened underbelly to chill though, chill is an affect arguably accessible only to those of a specifically privileged status. Chill is an aspirational affect, one that has become a status marker amongst wellness-minded, cis white women who equate chillness with a sense of homeostasis. Chill is an ideologically non-neutral affect, it is the ideal for elite cishetero white women in economies of resilience. “Chill” as James explains, is enacted by individuals who have already adapted neoliberal market logics, while appropriating the aesthetics and styles of people who can’t or won’t adapt (or, in James’ terms, do not have the capacity to adapt) [13]. Chillness here appropriates a sense of melancholy as a way to disidentify with the mainstream. Eilish’s sadness, even beyond “Sad Girl” is also communicating a sense of melancholy that operates within her chill register, effectively having her multi-layered moody cake and eating it too.\n\nThe final and most nascent affective aspect to depressive intensity is “baby.” At multiple points throughout *Blurry*, Finneas instructs Billy to sing “babier.” What this means practically is that she softly up-pitches her voice, making it sound younger than her age. Performing a baby voice is unsustainable and when prolonged, can cause long lasting vocal harm—as can be seen with Britney Spears, who was vocally trained to reproduce the baby voice of her most famous hits. It’s not difficult to understand the appeal of “baby.” A baby is a machine for getting attention in order to get its needs met. Implicit in a performed babyness is a performance of vulnerability and weakness, eliciting a sense of care. It is slightly manipulative, but in Billie’s case, she is literally the baby in the family. In meme logic, “i’m baby” refers to the relinquishment of agency as much as it does an admittance of one’s own lack of control and need to be cared for. It is an expression of both helplessness and uselessness, which can, at some angles, be interpreted as a resistance to the capitalist mandate of endless productivity, but, in another light is a giving up of accountability and responsibility. Anyone can be baby if you’re willing to make the world someone else’s problems. \n\n[with so much left to say ](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=13)\n\n## In Conclusion\n\nAs with many pop music documentaries, *Blurry* provides a verité style portrait of a hit sensation who is neither the full architect of nor the accidental subject of her own success. Throughout the film we see her exercise creative agency (she has gone on to direct subsequent music videos), as well as locate her within a deeply intimate family constellation. While her brother primarily drives the writing and production of the music, what does become apparent is that Billie is the architect of her interior world, and the way that synthesizes her synesthetic mind, tastes, and vocal and performative tonalities into a coherent vibe—depressive intensity. More than her ingenue status, her and Finneas’s musical virtuosity, or the wholesome O'Connell family narrative, what has fed into her success the most is the fact that this depressively intense vibe is being experienced en masse. She is symptomatic of a moment where the dominant cultural affect is one of depression, with the mandate to perform said depression at a high enough intensity to function as a productive, accelerated capitalism subject. Within that intensity lies elements of chill, a mood that appropriates melancholy into the realm of productivity, and equating adaptability with homeostasis, and baby — a performed helplessness, relinquishing agency in exchange for care, and abandoning a sense of individual accountability to the whole. Billie, like her fans, is constantly negotiating between self-reflexivity and passivity to the complex cultural forces at play. Cognizance of and harnessing the way that one’s vibe impacts the world is a way to exercise agency. By centering Eilish’s specific vibe, effectively making it the true subject of the film, Cutler allows us to anthropologically analyze its component parts and attempt to put language to something that otherwise resists or exists beyond the linguistic. If mood is the message, then it’s time we all learn to read.\n\n[or bury your friend right now](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=10)\n\n[1] Harris, Anita. *Future Girl: Young Women in the 21st Century*.

I've been captivated by the promise of blockchains and web3 ever since. However, for many intersecting reasons, I haven't gone \"all-in\" on building the future of the internet (and our world). Yes, I've engaged as a hobbyist all the while, but the bulk of my productive, intellectual energy has been spent trading my time and efforts for US dollars to the benefit of traditional corporations.\n\nLuckily, I'm *finally* going \"all-in\" and I want you to join me.\n\nHere's why:\n\nOver the years, I've developed a strong, opinionated world-view with a central focus on a re-imagination of capitalism via the reunion of labor and capital. However, the solution for changing the course of something as momentous as late-stage capitalism has frustratingly eluded me. Even as I've further crystalized this vision of a more equitable and accessible economic system, the means of bringing it to life appear further away. While I've maintained that decentralization will play a big part in whatever approach ends up working, until recently, I wasn't sold that any existing concept would tip the scale. So what has me convinced? DAOs.\n\nSimply, DAOs are a web3-native vehicle that achieves the ever-so important [reunification of labor and capital](https://twitter.com/heyellieday/status/1404360191177490435) and have seen rapid adoption in the recent years, but especially in the last year. Still, the capital DAOs control are order of magnitudes smaller than traditional organizations, which needs to change if we want to see widespread adoption of DAOS. But how?\n\nIn the same way that crypto has taken capital from the \"real\" world and bridged it to blockchains, DAOs need to effectively capture value from non-crypto economies and bring it under the influence of the DAOs themselves. Inspired by the concept of [Miner-Extractable Value (MEV)](https://compassmining.io/education/what-is-miner-extractable-value/), where miners use their unique advantages to capture value, I've devised the concept of DAO-extractable value, where DAOs do the same.\n\nI want to write an essay that explains the concept of DEV in great detail and how DAOs (new and existing) can leverage DEV strategies to capture value and dramatically increase the capital in their treasuries. In the spirit of web3, I plan on minting this essay as an NFT. I'm by no means financially independent, so to enable me to focus on this essay for a suitable period of time, I'm offering an opportunity to take shared ownership in this essay via Mirror's wonderful crowdfunding block rendered below:\n\n[DAO-extractable value explainer](crowdfund://0x54F35D2852e08fE7BFc23e1053fD0Ef444a05501?network=homestead)\n\nIf you choose to contribute to this crowdfund, you'll benefit from the upside the initial minting of the essay's NFT and future trades. You'll also get to own what I hope will be an important part of web3's widespread growth and adoption.\n\nPlease reach out to me on twitter at [@heyellieday](https://twitter.com/heyellieday) if you have any questions. \n\nThank you! 🌸🌈☀️", "timestamp": 1623883042, "digest": "Bl0zq7si0iS9xuZEalVVo4Ogu3t7kuMzreK1_abMkVA", "contributor": "0x6C70e5FC4e4926CD836A6F8B0645Aa1A077fa605"}

{"id": "2107t-Q-7In3t1TyK99qgzElNSOxSwZT5oWuw2wW1PI", "title": "On Online Social Consensus", "body": "**A treatise on crypto social and the motivations for the Yup Protocol**\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_2c5ae1d462b141299a590804a01b6bbe~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nWith help from the whole Yup team, and revisions from [*Sam Hatem*](https://hackernoon.com/@sam-hatem)\n\n### The Quest for Social Consensus\n\nSince the dawn of the internet, there has been an ambitious desire for open and public protocols for social networks. However, distributed social consensus on the web has remained highly regarded but rarely understood. It has not been valued based on determinant incentives and, as a consequence, remains widely misrepresented and opaque. Online engagement metrics such as reach and follower counts attempt to attach numbers to this force, but measure with regard to quantity rather than quality, making them easily manipulable and highly untrustworthy. These metrics fail to accurately capture social capital, leaving social networks highly vulnerable to weak governance, sybil identities, and the spread of disinformation, harming digital communities and trust. Under this system, users have little economic incentive to express their opinion on content and one another genuinely, and their opinions are weighted evenly regardless of their own social capital. As our online presence consumes most of our daily lives, our society will be defined by our ability to solve these new social problems on the internet. In our eyes, the quest for online social consensus is a continuous quest for a better humanity in the digital age.\n\nRecently, due to technological improvements to distributed systems and cryptography, the world’s social media leaders have begun to imagine similar designs enabled by blockchain tech. Industry titans such as Jack Dorsey (Twitter) and Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) have started research and development towards these exact ends. On the crypto-economic side of these developments, new innovators have emerged who are attempting to tackle problems around collective decision-making and DAO-based identity systems. Thought leaders in this field have realized that a better method of allocating the value accrued on online platforms is needed and could be achieved by incentivizing participants at every scale for their online actions, directly monetizing the content they create, rate, or proliferate.\n\nIn tandem to issues surrounding online social capital, the current centralization of most networks entitles operators to rent-seek and sway user behavior, all while hoarding user data that could provide an enhanced experience and new streams of income for individuals.\n\nIn an attempt to solve these pitfalls of the web, a group of students at Columbia University built [*Yup*](http://yup.io/?utm=blog), a protocol that facilitates the distribution, measurement, and governance of online social capital in a pseudonymous yet transparent opinion-based economy. That’s a technical way of saying that ***Yup is respect*** –a movement to represent, reward, and empower respect across the internet, with content primed to earn users’ approval, not attention.\n\nYup offers a fair weighting of opinions, a single universal reputation/identity that can be used on all sites without competing with existing business models, a native and scarce asset to facilitate monetization or attention markets, and an immutable record of reviews and reputations. Let us explore the shortcomings in existing centralized and decentralized systems, point to promising solutions, and propose a new protocol governed by social capital.\n\n## Identity\n\n### Identity in the Digital Realm\n\nWhat does it mean to be a valuable user online? Is this reserved for individual humans? Must they be legally recognized? In [**Authenticity in the Age of Digital Companions**](http://web.mit.edu/sturkle/www/pdfsforstwebpage/ST_Authenticity%20in%20age%20of%20digi%20comp.pdf), famed sociologist Sherry Turkle argues that “by the mid-90s, humans were not alone as emotional machines.” She also points to experiments where kids quickly treated robots as companions deserving of compassion despite being scientifically demystified. This type of interactions between bots and people will only increase over time, she suggests.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_567ed6bd2a4440ff963316b9940b550b~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nOne of our favorite Instagram users, [*@lilmiquela*](https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/), isn’t real in the *human* sense. But that hasn’t stopped her from becoming a superstar. Miquela is a self-described robot led by the Sequoia-backed media company [***Brud***](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V5N5tcfm7wBuUshgrmIOz9ijAO-VRqvkUbGRu0uKdI8/edit)**.** She’s cleverly placed alongside “real” people to appear life-like. This [*Gorillaz*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnrEEoVOUlE)-esque approach to identity is starting to catch on, as more and more Miquela wannabes sprout up.\n\n[***Block.One***](https://block.one/)**,** the blockchain development company behind EOS and Steem, have a new decentralized social media project called [***Voice***](https://voice.com/) that they announced last summer. The Voice project seems to take a different angle at this identity issue, opting to essentially require every sign up to legally identify themselves with documents such as a driver’s license or passport. Dan Larimer and others at B1 cite responsibility as their reason, wishing to hold users accountable for their interactions. It remains to be seen as how Voice plans on decentralizing this process over time, to make sure that their network doesn’t remain inherently permissioned. Identity DAOs like [***Humanity DAO***](https://www.humanitydao.org/) and [***Democracy Earth***](https://democracy.earth/) have tried to crowd-source identity, building economic incentives around the recognition of humans via incentive mechanisms that resemble universal basic income. *But both of these approaches lack the proper room for the lil’ Miquelas of the world.* The social networks of the future will still need to account for individuals, groups, teams, companies, communities, or even algorithms being represented by a single identity. A protocol shouldn’t by design limit users to one account tied to their real identity –furthermore, accounts shouldn’t be limited to one person or even a human.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_210b96020670486098e4899e9ef2ce63~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nIn a different piece from 2008, Sherry Turkle [*argues*](http://web.mit.edu/sturkle/www/pdfsforstwebpage/Turkle_how_computers_change_way_we_think.pdf) that “Online worlds can provide valuable spaces for identity play.” This is clearly seen by the emergence of ‘finstas’ (fake IG accounts) and group IG accounts, which represent a fundamental shift in the ‘roles’ online users take during interactions. In this sense, it becomes very difficult to properly attribute authenticity or inauthenticity to any one user. So as the lines between human vs. robot, person vs. group, as well as person vs. themselves begin to fade, what does ‘authenticity’ really mean?\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_4ac0f95ba10a412abf0b7b11dc813ca9~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nIt’s all about social value. A username or identity is only as ‘real’ as we allow it to be. If it matters to us as a society, it is in fact authentic, whether or not it owns a heart, four hearts, an XY chromosome, or CPU. For example, Satoshi Nakamoto is the still-secret pseudonym used for the creator(s) of Bitcoin. Yet today, it doesn’t really matter who Satoshi Nakamoto is/was, but what they represent and what kind of social capital their identity holds. The only information known about Satoshi is their digital footprint and social approval, and so that becomes their identity, the role they play, and the context in which one would interact with him/her/them. If Satoshi was found to be a robot, it would not change the power and reputation of their identity. Nothing but a private key signature would be necessary for them to take advantage of all of that built up social capital. So, if social value is crucial in determining identity online, humans need signal vehicles to properly perform in this new environment.\n\n### Data Autonomy\n\nFor the majority of web2 online platforms, user data has been a relatively zero-sum game. Every platform is incentivized to hoard data, hurting the user’s experience. For example, when you log in to Tinder via Facebook OAuth, Facebook Inc. is choosing what to share with Tinder and what not to share. While FB may permit you to allow Tinder to know some information, it hides the majority of your data and metadata because it’s extremely valuable and diminishes in value as access increases. This is despite the fact that this data could enable Tinder to provide you with a better experience. You as a user have no real say in this matter and, as a result, are the biggest loser from this zero-sum game. Since its inception, the world wide web has lacked solutions to this equilibrium, but distributed ledger technology has given rise to new projects and products aiming to disrupt this existing data competition and give users real ownership over their data. Sir Tim Berners Lee, the creator of the world wide web, has been working on a new project titled [***Solid***](https://solid.inrupt.com/) that’s focused around solving this problem. By way of the Solid “POD”, a storage locker controlled by private keys with different permissions, users can decide where to store their data. Since users have immutable ownership over their data, they’re free to move it at any time, choosing who has access to it without interruption of service. In order to write data as well as to read it, and to protect privacy, it is important to control who has access to what. In Solid’s case this is managed using the web access control list specification and the WebID Identity spec.\n\nOther teams are building similar products. [***OrbitDB***](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db), for example, tries to achieve similar peer-to-peer database capabilities, functioning as a serverless and peer-to-peer storage locker built on IPFS data storage and Pubsub. [***3Box***](https://3box.io/) is building a comparable framework for Ethereum applications. Smart contract platform [***Blockstack***](https://blockstack.org/) has prioritized these features, adding OAuth log-in and data locker capabilities to its base layer protocol. By way of a universal identity layer, Yup is providing similar functionality users, focusing on qualitative metadata as user’s most lucrative asset.\n\n## Attention\n\nOnline attention is a key ingredient in harvesting influence. Several entities have capitalized on this notion, quickly trading it as a commodity of product sales and branding. Additionally, it gave power and voice to advocacy. Most social media platforms remain economically efficient through the resale of what attention it could capture in exchange for its \\`free' content.\n\nContent creators in top social media platforms have little direct way to monetize their fans’ attention or get a share of ad revenue. In response, they have resorted to grossly ineffective workarounds. This resulted in an economy that disproportionately rewards a handful of centralized social media companies instead of the content creators that give such platforms value. Members of thriving online communities that exist on popular social media platforms currently have no control in the developments of the sites they helped grow; the length and extent of their engagement is undermined. Additionally, there is no direct relationship between the demand of users and sponsored content/monetization. This stunts influencers’ ability to build user loyalty around an account or channel. There are no real incentives to support quality content and discourage poor behavior.\n\nUpon examining the makeup of existing centralized social networks, we conclude that social capital is misrepresented and easily purchased, and the monetization of attention is one sided or separate from the network itself. Yup prioritizes respect instead of attention whereby the user is the customer, not the product. Our focus isn’t on growing engagement but rather curating content that people actually enjoy.\n\n### The Monetization of Attention\n\nThere are a handful of distributed ledgers, platforms, and applications being built to decentralize social networks and advertising. **Steem**, a decentralized social network blockchain, mints new tokens and rewards content creators for their virality. In order to mitigate sybil attacks, the Steem network must have certain barriers on account creation that hurts onboarding and thus the community at large. This is quite inefficient and counts on user error to bouey the price of STEEM, giving a strong advantage to profit-driven automated users.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_520507ed2fa74273ab1d424146ac290c~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nSimilarly, Voting bots plague the Steem network to such an extent that the community accepts them as a part of their ecosystem. Users can pay bots to curate their content or to vote on their behalf for rewards. Users can earn more tokens by proxy-staking to bots than by actually participating in the network. As a result, users are now incentivized to be less engaged and simply proxy-stake their holdings to maximize returns. This new form of advertising accepted by many protocol communities has additional issues including the lack of strong incentives to support channels and accounts, the direct relationship between token holdings and influence on the network which ignores user activity or length of involvement, unannounced shutdowns of the blockchain for updates, and rampant misinformation.\n\nNew models with similar designs have risen in the last few years. Originally built on the Steem blockchain, ***DLive***, an up-and-coming project that has partnered with celebrities like [*PewDiePie*](https://www.newsweek.com/dlive-pewdiepie-stream-schedule-app-youtube-1390512), began to gain traction in spring of 2019. It transitioned from Steem to **Lino**, a blockchain that similarly rewards content creators and curators through an inflation-based rewards system but includes donation (see Tipping section below). One of the key incentives for DLive’s chain transition must be because of Lino promising 70% of token rewards to apps and developers directly. Creators and curators of content, on the other hand, are expected to make most of their money from donations. Unfortunately, this may hurt Lino in the long run as ecosystems and communities become too siloed to reflect that type of rewards system. This already seems to be the case with Tron supposedly [*acquiring DLive*](https://cryptobriefing.com/tron-acquires-dlive-blockchain-streaming-platform/) in late December ‘19 and looking to transition the app away from Lino and to its own blockchain. Furthermore, the Lino blockchain [*defines reputation solely by money spent*](https://link.lino.network/whitepaper), leading to plutocracies and inaccurate reputation schemes.\n\n### Advertising\n\n**Marketplaces**\n\nAdvertisement is currently the primary form of online content monetization, often considered the ‘[*original sin*](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/)’ of the internet. While most of us hate ads, our favorite sites and platforms wouldn’t exist without them. However, it’d be nice we as users received a piece of this ad revenue both for contributing content for engaging with ads. Brave, the company that maintains the Basic Attention Token (BAT), has tried to compete with Google Ads on this front, building their own protocol and browser that pays users for viewing ads and allows them to tip sites they visit, the age old way of economizing content. However, they similarly fail to attribute value to social capital, measuring ad views equally for every individual despite their potential greater importance for ads – a billionaire and I stand to make the same money on Brave despite them being in much higher demand in terms of advertising. Tipping usually refers to the feature allowing consumers to send money to a creator. There are great mainstream and crypto examples of tipping, including YouTube, [***Patreon***](http://patreon.com/)**, **[***Cent***](http://cent.co/)**, **[***Peepeth***](https://peepeth.com/), and [***Tippin.Me**.*](http://tippin.me/)\n\n**Censorship**\n\nEvery social platform must deal with the well-documented tension between censorship and free speech. If censorship is too limited, inappropriate and sensationalist content surfaces super quick. If censorship is too liberally used, speech suppression is inevitable. This would lead to family-friendly communities on one side of the spectrum and censorship-resistant ‘explicit’ ones on the other side. A good example of this is [***Gab***](https://gab.com/), a social network that prioritizes low censorship. Today, Gab has a reputation of being a hotbed for white supremacists and other questionable actors. Finding a goldilocks middle ground between the two is incredibly difficult and requires distributed consensus. The community at large will always know what’s better for the network than the headquarters of a centralized entity, but they will be much slower and more inefficient in executing that vision.\n\nOne of the big advantages of decentralized social networks is that they’re often more censorship-resistant. One project that aims to leverage this advantage is [***AKASHA***](https://akasha.world/)**,** which stands for 'Advanced Knowledge Architecture for Social Human Advocacy'. AKASHA (2015) is an Ethereum blockchain-based decentralized social media platform that is embedded into the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS). The Akasha decentralized social media platform is built to ensure the platform is resistant against censorship and be unable to be taken offline because it does not have any one central point of failure or lack of bandwidth issues.\n\n## Opinions & Social Capital\n\nThe opinions of others are vital to the Internet economy; it is the core component upon which value metrics are built. This is most clear in online product/service reviews. A highly-cited [*Harvard Business School study *](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=41233)from 2011 estimated that a one-star rating increase on Yelp translated to an increase of 5% to 9% in revenues for a restaurant. [*Cornell researchers*](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-announces-settlement-machinima-and-three-other-companies-false) found that a one-star change in a hotel’s online ratings on sites like Travelocity and TripAdvisor is tied to an 11% sway in room rates, on average.\n\nThe internet’s peer-to-peer nature is a huge reason for this, as opinions have become more accessible. Average user rating has become a huge driver of sales, and now, user-generated ratings and narrative reviews can be found on almost every website that sells something.\n\nThe results of a 2017 study by Podium show that 93% of American consumers say that online reviews have an impact on their purchasing decisions. 91% of 18-34 year old consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. Star rating currently is the number one factor used by users to judge businesses.\n\nHowever, treating these social metrics as highly accurate does not necessarily make them so. University of Colorado Boulder professors Langhe, Fernbach, and Lichtenstein investigated the actual and perceived validity of online user ratings and found a \"substantial disconnect between the objective quality information that online user ratings actually convey and the extent to which consumers trust them as indicators of objective quality.\" They analyzed 344,157 Amazon ratings of 1,272 products in 120 product categories and compared them to ratings on Consumer Reports as well as resale value. They conclude that average user ratings correlate poorly with* Consumer Report *scores, and, while *Consumer Reports *correctly predict resale value, user ratings do not. This is because:\n\n\\- When reviewers are vetted and paid to review products (as is the case in Consumer Reports), their opinions are usually a stronger indication of quality.\n\n\\- Without a mechanism to ensure this, reviews lose their meaning.\n\nAdditionally, Langhe et al. argue that \"consumers fail to consider these issues appropriately when forming quality inferences from user ratings and other observable cues. They place enormous weight on the average user rating as an indicator of objective quality compared to other cues. They also fail to moderate their reliance on the average user rating when sample size is insufficient.\" In other words, the average user lacks both the data and know-how to make accurate inferences on the quality of products based on user ratings.\n\nDespite both the high value attributed to user opinion and the importance of monetizing it for accurate representation of quality, our own research suggests that less than 0.001% of online opinion is monetized today. Without any incentive to review honestly, users tend to express negative reviews more often and more extremely, with little to no reason to contribute positive reviews. This lack of monetization also tips the balance for malicious actors looking to manipulate their perceived quality: the incentives to create a false opinion for money from a malicious actor outweigh those to review honestly. Fakespot, a ratings analytics tool, [estimates](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/buyer-beware-a-scourge-of-fake-online-reviews-is-hitting-amazon-walmart-and-other-major-retailers/) that 52 percent of Walmart reviews and 30 percent of Amazon reviews are fake or unreliable.\n\n### Misaligned Incentives\n\nThere remains a fundamental misalignment between the incentives of the platform and its users in terms of user inputted opinions. The platforms gain from the influx of data, and do everything they can to ensure that this input of data is smooth, regardless of accuracy. Users have no incentive to review accurately and therefore act based on external interests. Crucially, this whole system is flawed because it functions independently of real monetization for all parties involved.\n\n**So why would people give honest opinions without any incentive? **This is why we witness 21% more negative reviews than positive ones; with no other incentives involved, anger/frustration seems to be the driving incentive for negative reviews. Yup is designed to solve this problem by financially incentivizing accurate opinions with monetary rewards. Limiting the number of actions a user can do is also important in order to establish scarcity.\n\n> *“More people are depending on reviews for what to buy and where to go, so the incentives for faking are getting bigger… **It’s a very cheap way of marketing.\"***- Bing Liu, Professor at University of Illinois\n\nIn the internet age, reviews have very much become a form of marketing and has evolved into an enormous business: [reputation management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_management). Companies need reputations, and reputations come from people, unless you can buy them for cheaper than an ad campaign.\n\n**The Consequences of Access**\n\nWe expect that changes in* access *that occurred as a result of the rise of the internet had a significant effect on the trust in and accuracy of opinions. Access in this case refers to both the ability for anyone to rate products/ services/ content and the ease at which one can see more ratings online.\n\nWhen online review forums first emerged, they provided increasingly accurate opinions because of the “[wisdom of the crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)” effect taking hold. In James Surowiecki’s *The Wisdom of Crowds*, the famed journalist talks about bad intuitions around individual vs. group decision-making. These initial communities were small, and natural reputation effects among members existed because many knew each other by name. As misconceptions about the internet dissipated, trust in these reviews grew because they were in fact more accurate. But as access continued to increase and platforms changed, the natural reputation effects shrunk. This decreased the reputation at stake for each user and allowed for fake reviews to thrive, reducing accuracy significantly. Now, there is still a correlation between accuracy and trust; more accuracy leads to more trust, BUT more trust doesn’t necessarily lead to more accuracy. In fact, the more trust users have in online reviews the more worthwhile they are to fake/manipulate, creating a harmful equilibrium: **more accuracy → more trust → less accuracy → less trust → more accuracy … **I talk about this further in my piece [*“Opinion Economy”*](https://www.blog.yup.io/post/the-opinion-economy).\n\nWhile public metrics of social approval are not the only way to attribute this form of social capital to an identity, it is a very important one, so the removal of those metrics is to the detriment of the establishment of internet identities. The obscuring of relative signaling by removing public likes, like Instagram plans on doing, can be massively harmful to the structure of the society because it takes this information (and therefore power) away from the viewers.\n\n**Experts**\n\n*The notion that all opinions are created equal online is a large reason for the inaccuracy of opinions.*\n\nPeople like to trust brands and institutions as experts on a certain subject. In reality, however, they rarely are the experts we expect them to be. This is first because finding experts is a skill of its own, which can be flawed and time-consuming. As there are more sources, statistics, data points, and faux expertise, it becomes increasingly difficult to spot experts. Surowiecki expands on this point: “The problem is that even if these superior beings, do exist, there is no easy way to identify them.” This is also true for the experts themselves, who also may not be aware that they are experts. In fact, those within a crowd that project themselves as experts rarely are.\n\nClaiming individual humans know less than they’ve ever known, Yuval Noah Harari breaks down the impact of power and technology on our individual knowledge in his book [**21 Lessons for the 21st Century**](https://philosophiatopics.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/yuval-noah-harari-21-lessons-for-the-21st-century.pdf). He explains that humans are even less aware of their cognitive blindspots today than ever before. Because Google gives us an answer to any question, we think we’re experts and have a difficult time identifying our skills and shortcomings.\n\n[***Roll***](http://tryroll.com/) seeks to tokenize influencers, aligning curators with the specific growth of creators and influencers rather than that of the network. The financial success of curators in this case is determined by the speculative trading of influencer assets. This has serious problems in enforcement but projects some key insights about influence online. This is a way to determine experts, but not in their original form, but wholly in influence, expertise, and attention.\n\nYup attempts to prioritize reputation-based social consensus over brands and institutions. When conceiving of Yup, we used advances in distributed systems to explore new ways to (1) improve the user’s ability to identify inaccuracies, (2) deter the manipulation/misuse of reviews, and (3) correctly weight reviewers’ expertise on certain topics, communities could reach a perfect correlation between changes in trust and accuracy. Yup utilizes layered social level consensus to build sustainable governance of its network and provide proper representation of network value. This orders participants by their recognized social level. Every address on the network will have a social level as a measurement of others’ opinions of them. Their individual social levels will be determined by all other addresses on the network.\n\n**Testimonials**\n\n**Testimonials **have long been an example of quality signal vehicles for identifying the quality or reputation of a product or service. People tend Recently, as expected, individuals have found ways to manipulate and mislead testimonials as well. The most humorous example of false testimonials that we’ve come across is the one highlighted by YouTuber Coffeezilla in his [*Fake Guru video on Sam Ovens*](https://youtu.be/ez8yKklc1lE?t=150) (‘fake gurus’ are defined as online personalities that falsely sell themselves as business gurus). In this hilarious video, Coffeezilla discovers that Sam Ovens’ top testimonial, Dave Rogenmoser, actually had been making seemingly fake testimonials for dozens of ‘fake gurus’ during a 2 year span and may have been a fake guru himself. This epitomizes both the weight viewers give to online testimonials and their potential for misuse and manipulation.\n\n**Attempts at Reputation**\n\nSites whose main function is reviews have taken stronger actions to represent reputation in opinions. **Yelp** attempts to show a user’s reputation by reflecting the votes others have given on their reviews (as well as some other stats). The advantage of this portrayal of reputation is that it allows users to vet reviewers as ‘legitimate,’ mostly negative or positive in their reviews, or as having tendencies to act a certain way. The main problem with these metrics is that they don’t provide information or expertise; if a user is funny, how does that make them a better reviewer of bars? Sure, if you dig deep enough, you can start to infer certain things like that a reviewer’s past opinions on car mechanics may be strongly supported by the community or that their reviews on hardware stores are thought to be useless. But the search costs for doing this for every reviewer are far too high right now.\n\nLastly, this representation of reputation doesn’t affect the weighting of stars for a business. You could have a good rep on Yelp and still have the same influence over average ratings as any other user.\n\nBy making everyone equal, no one can be discovered as an expert. **What we must realize is that opinions aren’t democracies;** we shouldn’t all get an equal say as to the subjective quality of products, venues, or anything else for that matter. What we need is more of a meritocracy, because some of us have earned the right to speak on certain topics with authority, not necessarily through a college degree or an award but could simply be receiving the continued approval of the online community. This one-person-one-vote model just doesn’t make sense for diverse decision-making, because it doesn’t distribute accurate weight to the expertise of various participants.\n\n**Scarcity and Stake**\n\nStrong opinion models should provide major incentives for accurate reviews. If users were rewarded (monetarily or otherwise) for reviewing things, they’d take the time to make better decisions. One way of doing this is by P2P validation, meaning that if other users agree with a user’s opinion, either by upvoting their opinion or by submitting a similar review, that user should get rewarded. Yup identifies content and distributes rewards according to the value (influence) of the opinions associated with that content. In this case, we define *content* as any specific data online that user(s) deem worth judging, including but not limited to texts, images, videos, locations, accounts, and links. The influence metric is a function of engagement, ownership over time, and reputation. In Yup’s case, the final important piece here is scarcity: users should have a limited amount of reviews that they can give within a set amount of time. If users stand to gain or lose from their reviews, and they can only give their opinion x times a day, they’re less likely to abuse or waste these reviews.\n\nOn the opposite side of incentive is deterrence; users should be deterred from submitting inaccurate reviews. This could be enacted in a similar fashion, whereby users lose something for giving bad reviews that no one agrees with or supports. With Yup, this comes in the opportunity cost of giving an opinion elsewhere, where users may miss the opportunity to see returns if they vote inaccurately.\n\nSimilar concepts has been attempted in the blockchain/cryptocurrency space with the *Token Curated Registries*: lists of similar products/content/etc. that are curated by staking cryptocoins. This can be perceived as ‘betting’ that a product will be liked by others and they’ll also vote for it. If others also bet on it, you receive a token reward, if no one does, you lose your stake. In many of those systems, earning tokens and purchasing tokens holds the same value, despite there being no evidence that this is the right way to represent network participation.\n\n## Governance\n\nIn *Culture and Power: The Sociology of Pierre Bourdieu*, David Swartz begins with “Culture provides the very grounds for human communication and interaction; it is also a source of domination.” The same could be stated about the online behemoths that presently host our culture. While traditional social networks have expanded the size and function of communication, marketing, and organization, their monopolistic increase in internet market power has drawn a wide divide in incentives between their services and their user base. While there are forces that compel large networks to comply to certain restrictions, the implications of the extent of their hold over human behavior is concerning. For example, in 2010, Facebook ran [*a stealth experiment*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22972300) on 61,000,000 American accounts during the US congressional elections to see how small messages (banners above the news feed) could affect user’s voter turnout and more. They argue: “The results show that the messages directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking, and real-world voting behaviour of millions of people. Furthermore, the messages not only influenced the users who received them but also the users’ friends, and friends of friends.”\n\nTheir results suggest that “Facebook social message increased turnout directly by about 60,000 voters and indirectly through social contagion by another 280,000 voters.” That 340,000 total represents about 0.14% of the country’s voting age population in 2010. For context, George Bush beat Al Gore in Florida by 537 votes in 2000. If a similar tight race occurred today, it wouldn’t be hyperbole to assume that Facebook could alter the political landscape of the United States with their [*4x user growth*](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/) and multi-billion dollar acquisitions since 2010.\n\nFacebook ran the voting experiment in 2010 but only made the results public in 2012 under their free will. If they had maliciously kept this study internal, the U.S. public and government may not have ever been aware. Second, because of Facebook’s immense network effects, the Cambridge Analytica data breach had little to no impact on its market dominance. Despite exposing over 80 million users’ information to third parties, resulting in trust in Facebook falling by over 50% in the following weeks, daily active users, minutes of usage, and advertising revenue all increased. This suggests that not only can giant social networks hide their manipulation, but also that average users are too network-dependent for their sentiment to be notably reflected in Facebook’s economics. Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes makes this same argument, arguing for the breaking up of Facebook into smaller companies in his famous *New York Times* piece “[*It’s Time to Break Up Facebook*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html)”. He writes that “Mark’s influence is staggering, far beyond that of anyone else in the private sector or in government.” At the helm of FB, Instagram, and WhatsApp, he argues that Zuckerberg has too much control. Despite being a publicly traded company, “Facebook’s board works more like an advisory committee than an overseer, because Mark controls around 60 percent of voting shares,” he writes. “Mark alone can decide how to configure Facebook’s algorithms to determine what people see in their News Feeds, what privacy settings they can use and even which messages get delivered. He sets the rules for how to distinguish violent and incendiary speech from the merely offensive, and he can choose to shut down a competitor by acquiring, blocking or copying it.”\n\n**Decentralization**\n\nThe benefits of decentralization have been highlighted thus far in this piece. However, decentralized protocols present their own issues such as bribing, collusion, and tragedy of the commons. Just like in their centralized counterparts, if a positive rating is worth more to a marketer than the money lost in achieving that rating on one of these platforms, they’ll surely try to manipulate it. This is entirely possible considering that users will probably not stake too much on one individual rating, especially if there aren’t that many participants. Except now, policing this must be governed democratically, making it more difficult at times. We all have heard of the [*PTSD that some Facebook moderators*](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa) have received from doing this kind of work…\n\n### First Layer Governance\n\nAt the consensus layer, there are several inefficiencies that can be improved upon with social capital. Nakamoto consensus uses proof-of-work to cleanly solve several issues in majority decision making, abandoning the notion of “one-IP-one-vote” for “one-CPU-one-vote”. However, one problem that arises as a result is the power ascribed to outsourced physical capital. Participants can gain more influence over the network by purchasing computational power with money from other economic systems. This means that the relationship between capital spent to maintain the network and the capital earned for doing so is not quite internal: 1 kW of electricity purchased with USD has equal power over the Bitcoin network as 1 kW purchased with BTC. PoS and DPoS mechanisms improve on this problem by requiring miners to stake network tokens to participate in consensus (‘one-token-one-vote’). Yet, it still does not properly reflect network participation: staking 1 network token that was purchased on an exchange provides the same mining power as 1 network token earned via mining. This dependence on physical capital makes networks susceptible to byzantine behavior from capital-rich outside parties as well as hinders the most-mover-advantages of participating in consensus. The ability to transparently quantify and represent social capital can provide stronger models for decentralized systems. Governed by an influence metric, the Yup protocol aggregates reputations, distributes opinion-based rewards, and facilitates fair ad exchange, resulting in clear, transparent consensus around social capital. It uses social level consensus to bring about anonymous P2P review and a money-resistant reputation scheme. This can be extremely helpful in solving some of the issues around protocol governance, particularly PoS and DAOs.\n\n## The Overweb, A Platform Agnostic Future\n\nBecause of the data silos laid out in the previous sections above, it may be likely that the open social protocol of the future will be platform agnostic and have overweb capabilities. Overweb is a term coined to describe software that is used to enhance one’s experience across the web rather than on one specific site or platform. The notion of platform-agnostic protocols is very well described by Mike Masnick in his piece \"[*Protocols, not Platforms*](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech)\".\n\n[***Klout***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klout) may be a great social example of overweb. Klout was a website and mobile app launched in 2008 that used social media analytics to rate its users according to online social influence via the \"Klout Score\". In determining the user score, Klout measured the size of a user's social media network and correlated the content created to measure how other users interact with that content.\n\nKlout used Bing, Facebook, Foursquare, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, and Wikipedia data to create Klout user profiles that were assigned a unique \"Klout Score\". Ultimately, Lithium Technologies, who acquired the site in 2014, closed the service in 2018. The largest reason for Klout’s failure, we propose, it’s lack of access to proprietary data of individual users on these other platforms. When Yup is attempting to aggregate influence across the web in this similar way, it is crucial that it exist atop a decentralized protocol such as the Yup protocol. Otherwise, it would quickly become difficult to integrate with any other site.\n\n### Status at Stake\n\nIn a platform where opinions are perfectly weighted and distributed, reviews would be more accurate. Investment in malicious marketing would be deterred. The distortion of customer reviews would be difficult. Cash would flow towards improving product quality + retaining users, rather than used to bolster the fraudulent image of a popular, well-liked company. However, accomplishing this in a fair and peer-to-peer manner is difficult without some decentralized consensus, which we’ll discuss below.\n\n## Data Legibility\n\n> *\"Those who cannot perceive the network cannot act effectively within it, and are powerless.\" - *[James Bridle](http://booktwo.org/notebook/drone-shadows/)\n\nPeople often talk about data transparency, but what about [data legibility](https://medium.com/doteveryone/data-legibility-and-a-common-language-coping-not-coding-part-2-8afb687de60)? Even if users have access to enough data on particular products, services, or the reviewers of them, rarely is that information fully comprehensible by the average user. The easier data is to understand and leverage to make better decisions, the more difficult it becomes to manipulate opinions and ratings. For example, review site Yelp could easily determine a score for a reviewer in different categories of rating. Reviewers could theoretically be given a high score for their reviews on mechanics while a low score for their reviews on bars, and have this be shown to the users directly from the venue page where the review was. By doing this, sites like Yelp can put more power into the hands of the users with the same data that is currently displayed on them.\n\n## Concerns & Liabilities\n\nIt’s important to consider ethical externalities and relevant responsibilities that a social protocol takes on. This is of extremely high priority for us at Yup. In the process of building, we're paying very close attention to these concerns. That being said, we feel that some of people's discomfort with our propositions are misguided and are worth discussing.\n\n### The Stigma of Social Scores\n\nSome initial users of our beta have stated that the implications of a reputation score lends a discomfort reminiscent of Black Mirror’s “Nosedive.” Some of the terminology that we use at Yup, such as “social value” or “influence” concerns people. [*Some writers*](https://bwog.com/2019/10/an-explanation-of-those-colored-underlines-around-campus/) have even stated that “the extension itself contains some indelibly frosty sense of robotic apathy, rendered void of human subtlety and liveliness.” What we hope people will come to understand is that Black Mirror is already the status quo, our social value is already objectified by social media companies that maintain their own internal rankings and assessments based on our online interactions. The problem is that we don't have access to the data and social value metrics that existing social media sites aggregate about us, users are disenfranchised in the status quo.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUltimately, a new social consensus protocol needs to sufficiently encompass many of these solutions: opt-in data autonomy, overweb reputation layer, and more. Our goal as a team is to explore what this may look like from the eyes of prioritizing individual merit in the face of data-driven networks. We’re looking for other teams to collaborate with and grow together. We’re big believers in procedural justice, encouraging and empowering our initial community to take part in determining what is valued and prioritized on Yup.\n\nWe envision Yup as a protocol for an incentivized, distributed, and censorship-resistant social systems that provides trustless data rights. The potential use cases of the protocol are infinite, and we foresee Yup as a foundation for new and separate applications that benefit from its unique qualities.

It can help you land your soulmate or your dream date. It can make you rich, and not just financially.\n\n*It stems from social capital: the extent to which one can influence another human’s behavior. *You can think of it as the power one acquires from social relationships (direct or otherwise), separate from money. That being said, considering the asymmetric information of today’s world, it is as valuable as dollars and purchased for pennies.\n\nIn the past, human contact was mostly face-to-face and therefore harder to fabricate. There were a handful of well-known and highly influential people, but the rest were only interacting with their local surroundings. Technology improved communication, and we birthed the ‘celebrity figures’ of radio and TV who held significant social capital. Then online influencers rose from the distribution properties of the internet and really shifted the balance. Today, everyone’s opinion about everyone is a common form of signaling: having 120k followers is like receiving an undergraduate degree in certain industries. People have begun to judge each other through media, getting data from news feeds. Social capital has multiplied in worth, defined by metrics such as the number of followers, likes, reach, engagement, or whatever. With them came influencer campaigns, viral videos, and Twitter-based presidential races. **We assign online metrics value and from them we derive our values**.\n\nInfluence is what makes the pen mightier than the sword. And while we fight today with digital pens and swords, influence is as mighty as ever. Let’s see what happens when we play around with the foundation of this influence.\n\n### Social 2.0\n\nThe connectivity of the world has made social platforms the launch pads of revolutions: The [Arab Spring began on Facebook](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284181844\\_The_Arab_spring_Its_origins_evolution_and_consequences_four_years_on). The [Black Lives Matter Movement](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/19/blacklivesmatter-birth-civil-rights-movement) saw its beginnings on social media and quickly exploded into a national movement.

With [3.9 billion people](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273018/number-of-internet-users-worldwide/) connected to the internet and [3 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/) using social media, anything is possible if you go viral.

Social media has evened the playing field and added new dimensions.\n\nTake a walk down a high school hallway today to see how the social capital game has changed for teens. What matters to them more than a Letterman jacket is their follower count, and subconsciously, their sacred *follow : follower ratio*. Not only do they need to prove that others are paying attention to them, they need to do it while not caring about others.\n\n> On Instagram, success depends on how well you follow the unspoken rules — you like my photo, I’ll like yours. If a photo isn’t getting likes, take it down. Be creative. Be consistent. [#followforfollow](https://www.blog.yup.io/blog/hashtags/followforfollow). Be ‘original’.\n\nIt’s not just about the amount of engagement you have, but also about how much engagement it looks like you have. Semi-official support groups form as people build their social capital together, engaging with each other’s content. From expertly crafting hashtags to carefully designing an appealing feed theme, being Instafamous is hard work. *On top* of that hard work is a layer of deception that everyone is participating in.\n\n> “The secret of life is honesty and fair dealing. If you can fake that, you’ve got it made.” — Groucho Marx\n\nIn an age where digital personas sometimes outshine real ones, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat are your best ways of obtaining social capital. And as our world becomes more and more digital, the benefits of achieving digital fandom are more real than ever.\n\n### Virtual content with real-world consequences\n\nDigital social capital has real-world value, not just high school popularity. Online metrics can lead to opportunities: money, jobs, exclusive access to anything. Companies are always on the lookout for new ways to reach consumers because they’re well aware that [70% of millennials](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/youtube-stars-influence/) trust influencers more than traditional celebrities and more than 40% trust them more than their own friends.\n\nPopular Insta-Influencers can make thousands through product placement. Twitter comedians have translated their online success to real standup careers. YouTube stars have become TV or music celebrities. All of them have been affected by fake activity on their platform. You might think Drake has more Twitter clout than Lil Wayne, but [https://fakers.statuspeople.com](https://fakers.statuspeople.com/) might disagree. It’s a platform that simply parses followers as fake, inactive, or good. While Drake has 13% more followers, most of his are fake or inactive and he only has HALF as many active accounts following him. Now, I don’t think all of these celebrities are faking their users, theirs may be a bi-product of the larger issue. Still, you can see how the misrepresentation can affect action. Obama’s are [11% fake](https://fakers.statuspeople.com/BarackObama)!\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1\\*JT70hgI6GevsExRfQdb4jw.png)\n\nEven the professional world values these online metrics. Competitive institutions ask for social media handles from applicants and LinkedIn metrics matter when hiring. Large amounts of digital social capital create the appearance of credibility. 100k followers must mean they’re doing *something* right.\n\nWe see this extending to the elite, who often feel that it’s not enough to be rich. **They wish to matter to those who matter. **In some ways, that sort of capital is more freeing than money. If you have enough followers, nothing is off limits.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1\\*wd1Fj1Udk_yPWQ2CKi\\_5Aw.png)\n\nWith 300 Insta-followers, good luck getting a DM response from your favorite celebrity. With 50k, they might acknowledge you. With 5 million, they’ll be your best friend. That’s just 21st century human nature.\n\nIn, 2015, local ‘legend’ David Duey Spargo [snuck in backstage at a Peking Duk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3345074/Man-fools-security-letting-stage-Peking-Duk-gig-editing-band-s-Wikipedia-page-make-look-like-family-mamber.html) concert by adding himself as their cousin on Wikipedia. He simply showed the bouncer their wiki page and was welcomed into the green room. In that moment, a fake wiki page edit did something for him that even a legit birth certificate of Peking’s real cousin couldn’t do: *manipulate human behavior*.\n\nWhile we love to see these social hacks, sometimes they’re used by selfish people to force an action. That is when the opaqueness of all of these metrics become destructive. The infamous Fyre team collaborated with the commonly disliked f\\*ckjerry and inflated hype around the festival through fake accounts. While this helped them spread the word quickly, it was massively imbalanced with the product they were actually providing, but customers couldn’t differentiate because of the top-notch marketing and influencers. This led to a con that went on too long full of fake bungalows, unconfirmed artists, fake island, fake promises. And, to this day, smart people talk about how their marketing scheme was revolutionary. There are more direct uses. Someone who’s willing to shell out a little cash can will a story into reality. Last summer, a friend showed me that Tatatu’s Andrea Iervolino was paying for [fake users ](https://www.instagram.com/andreaandselina/)and reporters to spread rumors that he was dating Selina Gomez in an effort to get her to be with him. They never even remotely dated from my understanding, but that didn’t stop [Yahoo from writing about it](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/selena-gomez-apos-boyfriend-3-160202896.html): *Who Is Selena Gomez’s New Boyfriend? 3 Things To Know About Italian Producer Andrea Iervolino — Including How He Was Once Sued For Sexual Assault.* Not the title I would’ve gone with, but this is somehow seen as real news. Those accounts and posts have been deleted and I have no way to confirm the story, but I‘m not trying to make a specific point about Andre. What’s interesting is that this kind of behavior can happen and most likely does. Even if we’re not all famous enough to pretend to date Selena, the average user can do serious damage online through the most subtle of ways. But just how easy is this?\n\n### The Internet of Fakes\n\nIt’s actually easy to boost social metrics…like *really *easy. Like, “*it can’t possibly be this easy*” easy. Whether it’s followers, retweets, shares, views, or comments that you want, they can all be bought. For really cheap too! There are operations around the world that provide these services and it’s difficult to believe exactly what they’re doing until you see it with your own eyes. Above is a Chinese *click farm*: a rig of thousands of smartphones pretending to be real users. These phones are liking, commenting, following, viewing, streaming, favoriting, and sharing the content of paying customers. Using a separate phone per user makes it very difficult for apps to distinguish bots from humans.\n\n#### Robin Hood Experiment\n\nIn an attempt to better understand the impact of fake social capital, [like many others](http://mediakix.com/2017/08/fake-instagram-influencers-followers-bots-study/#gs.5jdvqg), I purchased some social clout, ran some bots, and manipulated some metrics myself. To make it worthwhile, I directed most of those resources to support friends of mine who are influencers, mostly musicians and fashionistas. I took some notes and compared it to other experiments, learning a lot from the process as I’ll lay out in this piece. Many of my friends don’t know I did this and may be finding out for the first time reading this. If so, *it was me!* I promise no influencers were hurt in the making of this.\n\nFor less hassle than getting real attention and less money than an *avocado sandwich*, you can grow any social media account. There are some obvious rules to follow. You can’t grow too fast; going from 1 thousand → 1 million IG story views in one day will raise some red flags. The larger you get, the more costly it becomes and the less valuable it is; 10 IG followers cost one penny — and that’s the *expensive* option—but 10 million unique followers to one account will cost more than a million pennies. Followers fade over time, but likes and comments are forever.\n\nNo matter how you measure your social capital, it’s all available at the click of your mouse.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/0\\*peN3CWZjSromDZDC)\n\nI mean, look at this convenient [menu](https://followiz.com/services). It’s like a candy store for insecure teenagers or ambitious millennials. And who could blame them; this stuff is valuable. My attempts were pretty successful in getting over 250,000 engagements of various types on several accounts with less than $10 altogether using these tools. From the perspective of the guys at [Mediakix](http://mediakix.com/2017/08/fake-instagram-influencers-followers-bots-study/#gs.5jdvqg) who ran a similar study with two fake accounts:\n\n> “Within a day, we had enough content to build two entirely fake accounts. Next, we posted daily and purchased followers. We started with buying 1,000 followers per day because we were concerned that purchasing too many followers at the onset would result in Instagram flagging the account. However, we quickly found that we were able to buy up to 15,000 followers at a time without encountering any issues.”\n\nIn addition to the ease at which you can do this, there are some other important features worth noting:\n\n#### You don’t need to pay.\n\nSome bots and engagement groups are free. Just engage with other people’s pages and they’ll engage with yours– tit for tat. Groups like this one on Telegram promote 24-hour channels with thousands of individuals. That way, they leverage everyone’s engagement to give all members a higher perceived social capital. This channel in particular, has 60 groups with over 600,000 participants.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0\\*DIUIXQxKXrS7MI_P)\n\n#### You don’t need to identify yourself.\n\nNone of these sites, bots, or tools require you to sign in with your socials. They allow for quick anonymous logins, encrypted messaging, and payments with crypto currencies or a credit card. This means that it’s tough for social media apps to prove that *you* did this yourself and someone else didn’t prank you or something. Their ability to discourage you from doing this malicious stuff depends on how easy it is to tell that your engagement is faked, which today is incredibly difficult.\n\n#### You can’t really tell\n\nSkeptics argue that it’s easy to spot fake accounts and bot activity. And yes, some are very obvious for sure, but the more you’re willing to pay, the realer they become, all the way to real humans pretending to be your loyal followers. While a marketing firm might look critically at their applicants’ social media activity, the average person doesn’t. Most companies don’t either. In their experiment, [Mediakix](http://mediakix.com/2017/08/fake-instagram-influencers-followers-bots-study/#gs.5jdvqg) was able to convince 4 companies to pay and send free products to fake accounts and bots.\n\nIt’s enough that someone has 50,000 followers and that their posts regularly get millions of engagements to net a contracting deal. And success begets success — it’s a rolling stone. 5 bucks might be just enough to get the ball rolling in the early days of your social media journey. A quick five-thousand followers are easily observable if thousands of legitimate followers come after. It’s even common for genuine influencers to start their careers off with 1k fake followers to build a base. No one would be the wiser.\n\n*Some fakeness is obvious. *There was recently a [report](https://www.trustnodes.com/2019/03/24/close-to-half-of-justin-suns-new-followers-revealed-as-fake) that 20,000 of [Justin Sun’s](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron) recent 50,000 followers are fake. Justin is the founder of TRON, a blockchain, a technology in which community and social capital play a large role. You can see below that his followers consisted of accounts with no profile pic, bio, tweets, or other followers/following. This would be a prime example of what *not *to do. I wonder, how many of his 1 million total followers do you think are fake? And further, would Tron have hit a market cap high of $16.7 billion if not for this fraudulent manipulation? Only Jack Dorsey knows…\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1\\*EnhTgV1VDDkEZ07ThkNQcQ.jpeg)\n\n*Some are more sophisticated*, like Chinese companies and consultants that use real people to submit fake reviews on Amazon products. They use ‘human click farms’ much like the wall of phones but with workers in an office somewhere. Lots of money is on the line to be the top ‘sunglasses’ listed on Amazon, which largely comes down to user reviews. So people hire ‘experts’ to help them increase ratings. As long as the information sounds ‘American’, it will pass as a legit review and have serious impact on placement. If you have a way to detect these scalably, Amazon is surely hiring.\n\nIn a world where social metrics are purchased or manipulated, how can we trust them? **How can we value social capital? **Maybe, you could argue that real people showing up to somethings is still a measure of social value. Nope! Even that can be bought with [Crowds on Demand](https://crowdsondemand.com/), a service for on-demand crowds of people. This notion expands to all forms of business, legal proceedings, security risks, etc. How will we measure this type of value in the future? Let’s look at some of the tricks available for this type of manipulation.\n\n### Tools of the Trade\n\n#### Bots\n\nRobots may have not taken over the world yet, but they’ve conquered social networks. This includes bots that automate activity from a user’s real account (like following people in large quantities until they follow you back and then unfollowing them) or activity on other accounts that benefits the user (likes from random accounts). While researchers have done their estimates, there is no consensus on how many bots there are on various social networks. The conservative guess is 20% but some go as high as +50%. Facebook has openly admitted to roughly [12% fake accounts / duplicates](https://mashable.com/2017/11/02/facebook-phony-accounts-admission/#Hs2OUKDGiPqu). What’s more interesting is how pervasive bots are in scandals. In 2016, Ferrara, Varol, Davis, and a few other researchers completed a [highly recommended study](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2820000/2818717/p96-ferrara.pdf?ip=72.229.113.75\\&id=2818717\\&acc=OA\\&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E3EFC16F61770927B&\\__acm\\_\\_=1555258724\\_1da37ca292e2dd930aa2ed9ae9b86801) on social bots. It’s full of very interesting visuals for those who hate to read. Below is a network visualization of all twitter interaction surrounding the [#SB277](https://www.blog.yup.io/blog/hashtags/SB277) vaccine laws in California. The red nodes are users identified as most likely bots, the blue nodes more likely human, on a spectral scale. The node size represents influence (times a user is retweeted). Notice how the large nodes close to the center of the large cluster are mostly red? It seems as though bots are significantly driving the spread of information surrounding this event. On the right, you can see a cluster of mostly blue nodes, which may mean that this group has remained more diligent about not engaging with bot activity. No important debate is free from some automated social liquidity.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1\\*OTdk9L1uaTqUCRMv08TJkA.png)\n\n#### Registries\n\nWe all take Google Maps locations as legitimate and verified, making it one of the most vulnerable sites for data manipulation. Being at the top of a *Google Maps* listing, like Amazon, is a powerful seal of approval, so some try to fake their way there. As Bryan Seely, discussed in his[ Ted talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c6AADI7Pb4), Google’s algorithms are easily manipulated. With simple social capital manipulation, he managed to tap the *Secret Service*’s phone lines.** It took him 20 minutes.**\n\nHe created an identical *Secret Service* listing in Washington D.C with a different phone number. Same address as the original and he even added more pictures for good measure. Then Bryan deleted the real office’s reviews and added fake reviews to his fake listing. His antics switched the *Google* weighting and suddenly, his listing was placed higher than the real one. People began calling his phone in search of the secret service. He routed all official *Secret Service* calls through his own number and recorded all of them. He was never caught for this — Bryan volunteered this information to the *FBI *a few weeks later. The *FBI* told *Google* to fix the problem. They did for about 4 weeks by significantly raising their security standards, and then quickly returned to the algorithms they used before.\n\nBut even if *Google* had addressed the issue, how could they prevent this entirely? If reviews and engagements can be purchased, any individual can vault a listing to the top. And this happens *all the time. *When it does, the consequences can be disastrous.\n\nPeople’s livelihoods depend on how the internet organizes information. In one prank, the weekend hours for this[ man’s](https://www.wired.com/2014/07/hacking-google-maps/) restaurant were changed to “closed” on *Google Maps*. The culprit is still unknown — but it was enough to entirely sabotage his business. Within a year, the Serbian Crown was closed down. The legal recourse available to the owner was virtually nonexistent. Proving causation in this situation is impossible. This is just one of many stories. This 2013 *Wired*[ article](https://www.wired.com/2014/07/hacking-google-maps/) highlights numerous examples. Competitors can act maliciously with virtually no consequences and to devastating effect.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0\\*4-0xzYxv4AQ-DhTq.jpg)\n\n**William S. Burroughs once said, “*You can’t fake quality any more than you can fake a good meal*.” Well, Oobah Butler did both, **pushing his restaurant to #1 on *TripAdvisor* in London. The catch was, the[ restaurant never existed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqPARIKHbN8). He created a website, took funny fake pictures like the one above, set up a phone line, and got verified on *TripAdvisor*. A few fake reviews in and the real calls started coming. He even allowed some callers to actually eat at the restaurant, serving cup noodles and microwaved pasta to snobby foodies, who ate it up. He didn’t just fool *TripAdvisor *and it’s users. PR firms and marketers fell for it too. *The Shed at Dulwich, *as he called it, received so much buzz that he ended up opening it as a real restaurant that functions today in high dining.\n\n#### Deepfakes\n\nFake or malicious content won’t be going away anytime soon. In fact, as technology improves, it will become easier than ever to misdirect people and spread disinformation. This [Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/12/deep-fakes-fake-news-truth) discusses the growing potential for creating fake videos with real people. Facial generation software can already create faces that are virtually impossible to recognize as fake. One site called [*Which Face is Real*](http://www.whichfaceisreal.com/index.php) highlights the difficulty to distinguish real faces from fake ones with a game that asks users to choose between a fake and real photo. Below is an example.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1\\*XnSgwj77diHmlKSMlIoPtA.png)\n\nWhat will be the consequences when software can create live videos of anyone saying anything — indistinguishable from reality? We’re not there yet,[ but we’re getting close](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ54GDm1eL0). Yes, in certain cases, the costs may be enormous to effectively and convincingly generate fake social capital. However, the costs are no longer a barrier when the real world incentives are so high. What is a few hundred thousand dollars if it makes you famous, propels your restaurant to number one, or manipulates a political election? The results can be priceless…and destructive. The reality is, social capital is incredibly easy to manipulate, platforms are helpless to stop it, and the fraud has serious, real-world consequences. Soon, we’ll have a hard time distinguishing fake from real and lies from advertising.\n\n### We crave social scarcity\n\nEugene Wei, in his essay “[Status as a Service](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service)”, eloquently breaks down the science of social media. Every successful social network is built around how users acquire social capital, he poses. Capital must be earned through *work — *endless hours of YouTube video editing, Instagram photo shoots, the perfect Twitter joke.\n\n> “If it were so easy, it wouldn’t be worth anything. Value is tied to scarcity, and scarcity on social networks derives from proof of work. Status isn’t worth much if there’s no skill and effort required to mine it.”\n\nAs humans, we are experts at deciphering how and where our efforts are best directed for the most social capital accumulation. Popular social media platforms provide fair and valuable ways for people to acquire capital.\n\nHere’s the problem. As Eugene Wei writes — all this fame and popularity — is valuable because it’s rare. People care about your social capital because not everyone can get it. If anyone could get a million follows or fifty million views, you would need to have much more than that to be special. If it doesn’t take work, then it’s not worth it.\n\nWhat is left out of Wei’s extensive description of these economic models is the existing incentives to “fake it till you make it” rather than to “keep it real”. The loopholes are real, and people use them to get likes that look like yours. There are economic reasons to use fake followers to grow social influence and it makes sense that social networks are allowing it to happen for more data and advertising. Let me explain with some amateur game theory and shady club promoters…\n\n### The Influencer’s Dilemma\n\nImagine two Miami club promoters, Brett and Vegas, have 10,000 Instagram followers each and are competing for the attention of partygoers. Since their businesses strongly depend on social metrics, each of them would gain from having more followers than the other (+2) and would lose from having less (-2). Every day they must choose: **work hard attracting real followers the good old fashioned way –**or–** work hard *and* buy fake followers. **This is outlined in a payoff metric below. (Note: this is a highly simplified version of what actually happens; the payoff functions are more complex than this, but I think it serves its purpose as an example)\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1\\*M2R_kDYWpFSblRTknksFDQ.jpeg)\n\nIf neither of them buys fake followers, they’re about as happy as before, with probably an equal amount of followers between them (1,1). Fake followers aren’t as valuable as real ones, but they’re cheaper social capital, especially if most users haven’t caught on yet. Both Vegas and Brett know that whoever starts buying fake followers first will have more followers and a higher perceived social status. At some point, Brett moves first and gets fake followers (-2, 2). From that point, every day that Troy doesn’t *also* start buying fake followers leaves him further behind, pressuring him to do the same now that the new average for promoters is slightly more than 10,000 followers. As Troy catches up, the norm continues to increase, pushing Brett to up his use as well. Before long, they’ll find themselves in an *equilibrium state of follower inflation*. This is like the classic [prisoner’s dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) where both players take a worse outcome in order to make sure they don’t get totally screwed. But this case is a multi-round game, meaning influencers have to make this decision daily and may lag further behind, increasing their losses and the overall effect.\n\nYou can imagine this at a massive scale:\n\nOne influencer buys fake followers → the average follower count goes up → other influencers need to buy to catch up → count increases again → more influencers buy more fake followers → and so on. Before you know it, anything less than a million followers is just not important enough.\n\n( To clarify, “fake” here can mean any of the malicious ways one can acquire social capital, not necessarily buying followers. This is just one example. Also, this doesn’t apply solely to ‘followers’, but can be *likes, comments, streams, votes, shares, retweets, etc.*).\n\nIf nothing is done to make it harder to create fake activity or easier to spot it, this inflation continues to drive out good social capital and quality content, which becomes increasingly less worth spending time on. No one wants to spend 3 hours crafting a great story to gain 100 users when the new average is 1 million. **So the influencer’s dilemma is between 1: being ‘honest’ while risking falling behind and 2: debasing everyone’s social capital (including their own) to get ahead. **If they play out the game in their minds, buying fake followers as soon as possible seems like the only logical choice.\n\n#### Why don’t companies do something?\n\nYou could imagine that Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and others have the tools at their disposal to stop or reduce fake behavior. They could hypothetically require legal IDs for every account, action, and engagement on their platform. They could check each image, one by one, to make sure they’re real before adding them to Instagram. This would make it much more difficult to spread fake content. Returning to the Ted Talk about wiretapping using Google Maps, the speaker explains how Google, after getting an earful from the secret service, increased their security restrictions for maps related activity. 4 weeks later, when the secret service wasn’t looking anymore, they lowered the standards once again to their previous level. Why?\n\n> This is because tech giants survive off data: to convince users to give them free data (restaurant reviews, service ratings, location pins), they need to make inputing data as easy as possible. This comes at the expense of security.\n\nSo Google wants to make sure that you continue giving your opinion on top restaurants in the area. For this, they sacrifice the ability to always protect you when you’re looking for a restaurant. It’s a delicate balance in some ways.\n\nAd-driven companies also benefit from the simple fact that there are more users on the platform due to fake activity. They sell user reach, and this increases their numbers. This is why they sometimes boast about reaching more millennials than actually [exist according to the census](https://mashable.com/2017/09/06/facebook-census-metrics/#.ILltJiro5qR).\n\nThe value of this social capital inflation for platforms depends on user sentiment: if we care, they’ll change it. When Facebook made [millions on fake news](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/russian-operatives-used-facebook-ads-to-exploit-divisions-over-black-political-activism-and-muslims/2017/09/25/4a011242-a21b-11e7-ade1-76d061d56efa_story.html?noredirect=on\\&utm_term=.d79045b2c954) and bots during the 2016 election, public outrage and the hearings pushed the company to increase its security investments. This, apparently, came at the [cost of profitability](https://money.cnn.com/2017/11/01/technology/business/facebook-earnings/index.html). While I commend Zuck for taking this seriously, in some ways, it’s interesting that their business model is somewhat misaligned with the security of users.\n\n### Wikipedia\n\nIronically, Wikipedia seems to be the only large-scale network to overcome these challenges. While there are some sellers around, there is [no real market for artificially manipulating](https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/08/22/dont-pay-for-wikipedia-articles/) Wikipedia articles or commissioning them. Wikipedia’s decentralized governance does an excellent job censoring this behavior. The reality is though, Wikipedia did not achieve this by eliminating the quest for social capital. Instead, it developed a series of checks and balances that awards capital to those deserving few. Wikipedia’s 150,000 word constitution is protected by rank and file, unpaid editors, who keep a watchful eye over the network. Disputes are discussed in open forums and a resolution must be reached since only one article for a particular topic can exist.\n\nWikipedia is built on the shared philosophical basis as democracy: since you can’t trust any single person, give the power to the masses. Wikipedia uses reputation to award social capital and punishments usually strip users of their reputation. One consideration as to why Wikipedia “works” is that the platform is non-profit. Wikipedia’s goal is not viewer engagement but rather truth and fact, elements that traditional platforms are willing to overlook in their pursuit of profit.\n\nAs we look for solutions to this social capital bubble, Wikipedia’s platform is one to model. The reality is that it’s not possible to eliminate social capital’s captivating charm. Instead, we must identify how to create platforms that award people influence fairly, based upon the real value they provide ([Forbes](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/03/why-wikipedia-works.html))([NY Mag](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/03/why-wikipedia-works.html)).\n\nWhen it comes to social capital today, its value is seriously corrupted. The world assigns the same value to digital social capital as physical social capital without recognizing that acquiring the former is much easier than the latter. People have not yet internalized that most forms of digital social capital is for sale. They don’t grasp how effortlessly people can manufacture likes, purchase followers, and artificially create popularity. They don’t understand that complicated algorithms and tailored weighting systems are boundless if they’re based on metrics that can be bought in minutes. And when this bubble pops, when people finally understand that all a follower count indicates is how cunning a person is, then we’ll be forced to turn elsewhere. We’ll have to develop systems that value *you* for your content, your ideas, your *value*, rather than for your artificial metrics. We’ll need a way that allows everyone to easily verify the veracity of social capital in a way that, for thousands of years, depended upon the presence of real live people.\n\n### Crypto?\n\nJust like with everything else, crypto is trying to solve some of these issues. Token economics allow for other means of reflecting online metrics. By measuring *staked* tokens rather than number of likes/reviews/etc., users are committing to the ‘truth’ or ‘value’ of some content, and there is an inherent scarcity in that action. In many cases, these tokens are at stake when making votes, so people are monetarily incentivized to do the right thing. We’ve seen a lot of support for this in the tech space but have yet to come across a product that truly handles the major concerns. Vitalik talks about this extensively in his [most recent piece](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/04/03/collusion.html). Most attempts have been flawed and susceptible to bribery, collusion, and plutocracy.\n\n#### Perfect misbehavior\n\nWhile some blockchain projects are attempting to solve these problems, the same behavior is ironically seeping into crypto metrics. Cryptocurrency exchanges are famous for faking their volume, pretending to have more users and money flowing through their platform. Analytics from [TIE](https://thetie.io/) show that many are faking [more than 99%](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13\\_L5V9elxQ3xps62BeYVyr_Wu-9vfyAyN5tGqLNoV9Y/edit#gid=582401092) of it.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1\\*mOIyn9xnfNbsvgwIp6N92g.png)\n\nThe same is occurring with on-chain performance. Sites like Da[ppRadar](http://dappradar.com/), [State of the dApps](http://stateofthedapps.com/), and [blocktivity](http://blocktivity.info/) measure and rank user activity on various blockchains based on how many daily and monthly active users as well as transaction volume they have. In an attempt to prove that they have more user activity than other applications or blockchains, many projects are faking activity on their network to reach the top spots on these sites, resembling the registries hacks we mentioned above. This is especially common on blockchains like TRON and EOS, where transaction fees don’t necessarily cost extra money. This makes faking a few thousand users quite cheap and very impactful in a nascent industry where billion-dollar projects still lack more than a few hundred real ones. In the crypto space, those who care about transparency have yet to find a better way to measure this.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1\\*hVUSkaGkOWF5pLZFouUwmw.png)\n\n### Conclusion: Shhh…\n\nSo if you’re reading this, don’t bother sharing it with your friends. It’s our dirty little secret for now that. It only works if no one else is aware. Every person we tried to tell about this was only interested in how they themselves could use it. So go buy followers. Buy fame. Buy popularity. It won’t last forever, but for pennies you can make yourself cooler today. Getting social capital has never been easier and yet, amazingly, it still holds as much value as ever. At least until everyone realizes.\n\n\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\_\n", "timestamp": 1623897090, "digest": "SJS3SeSD2ep7CLqMrBPe8W8dwXnOyvd99B7re-oJTD0", "contributor": "0x30E838D51c61811d382962B4e0699715462DcdE1"}
{"id": "qdonPetomNJySSmwPQSFTF6S-GkNSjPyPC_Za3xbJjQ", "title": "Should Likes Exist?", "body": "### There has been serious debate on the importance of public 'likes' on social media platforms. Let's discuss this further.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_4f5b7f6c1657432a8747d08612665968~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.jpg)\n\n*Originally published on *[**Hacker Noon**](https://hackernoon.com/should-likes-exist-6fj9324d)\n\n**Should social metrics (such as “likes”) remain public on social media platforms? **There has recently been action by platforms such as Instagram to remove likes from the public eye, meaning only creators would see reactions to their content and no one else. This has been met with substantial support by the online community, but I'll draw on sociologist Goffman’s views on the performed self and Sherry Turkle’s points on authenticity to argue that these metrics of social approval are vital to the sustainable cohesion of online societies. Public likes are critical in order to produce quality interactions between users. This is clear through the lens of sociologist Erving Goffman, who is well known for his arguments on social interactions in The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, seeing every interaction as a performance with a stage, actors, and lines of sorts. For the sake of specificity, let us take Instagram as our ‘stage’, imagine the removal of public likes, and pay attention to two of Goffman’s specific points.\n\n### Signaling\n\nFirst, Goffman argues that a person’s identity is interactional, meaning, among other things, that they understand who they are by the cues they receive from others. This suggests that likes are important in signaling which performances are ‘good’ and which ones aren’t to the user. This importance is still somewhat satisfied under the removal of public likes, since the user can still see their received likes. But this brings up a question of relativity: what is a “good” amount of likes? If you can’t see anyone else’s like count, how can you be certain about the value of your own performance and adjust? In the ‘real world’, relativity is critical in weighing signal vehicles: making your grumpy grandpa laugh is a much larger feet than making your baby cousin laugh, because grandpa never laughs. If you’re a high school band, a 250-person turnout to your concert is great news because it would be above average for a band of your caliber, but if you’re a pop star, that same turnout would be quite embarrassing. The same applies for social media: on Facebook today, my content averages roughly 50% less likes than it did in 2015. This is mostly due to the fact that my friends don’t use Facebook anymore, which is apparent by the decrease in likes my peers receive on their content as well. If I had no idea that their content was receiving less likes, I’d take my decrease in likes as a cue that I am underperforming. Second, not only is this relative signaling important to the content creator themselves in valuing their performance, but it is vital to the viewers’ ability to do the same. Goffman explains that:\n\n> “when an individual enters the presence of others, they commonly seek to acquire information about him \\[...] They will be interested in his general socio-economic status, his conception of self, his attitude toward them, his competence, his trust-worthiness, etc.”\n\nUsers are interested because they need this information in order to know how to interact. The likes of others can very often validate a performer one knows nothing about. Performers know this, which is why they search for this validation even when it isn’t quite required.\n\n![](https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/jYHmwdimS0i65ldBmNjw)\n\nReturning to Instagram, a perfect example of this behavior is the “New Post” content one sees all over Instagram “stories”. IG stories don’t have public social metrics (other users can’t see the like or view count of stories) but have become the primary way of communicating and consuming IG content, so users are now sharing their regular posts as stories in order to drive viewers/likers to their posts and boost their public metrics (see screenshot to left for example). These posts are often covered in GIFs or text (ex: TAP HERE) to force viewers to engage with the full post in order to see the photo. They could simply share the photo as a story instead of a post, reducing friction, but then they wouldn’t receive any public signaling. This example provides us with two clear insights: first, both creators and viewers benefit from this public signaling, and second, users will always find new ways to earn and display this signaling.\n\n### Authenticity\n\nIn addition to performance, a key function of public social metrics is to provide a metric of ‘authenticity’ in the digital age. In Authenticity in the age of digital companions, Turkle argues that “by the mid-90s, humans were not alone as emotional machines.” She also points to experiments where kids quickly treated robots as companions deserving of compassion despite being scientifically demystified. This type of interactions between bots and people will only increase over time, she suggests. But this extends beyond bots to ‘finstas’ (fake IG accounts) and group IG accounts, which represent a fundamental shift in the ‘roles’ online users take during interactions. In this sense, it becomes very difficult to properly attribute authenticity or inauthenticity to any one user. So as the lines between human vs. robot, person vs. group, as well as person vs. themselves begin to fade, what does ‘authenticity’ really mean? For me, it’s about social value. A username or identity is only as ‘real’ as we allow it to be. If it matters to us as a society, it is in fact authentic, whether or not it has a heart, four hearts, an XY chromosome, or CPU. For example, Satoshi Nakamoto is the still-secret pseudonym used for the creator(s) of Bitcoin. Today, it doesn’t really matter who Satoshi Nakamoto is/was, but what they represent and what kind of social capital their identity holds. The only information known about Satoshi is their digital footprint and social approval, and so that becomes their identity, the role they play, and the context in which one would interact with him/her/them. If Satoshi was found to be a robot, it would not change their impact and previous interactions. So, if social value is crucial in determining authenticity in the digital age, users have the right to every signal of social value possible in order to perform correctly, including likes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile public metrics of social approval are not the only way to attribute this form of social capital to an identity, it is a very important one, so the removal of those metrics is to the detriment of the establishment of internet identities. The obscuring of relative signaling by removing public likes can be massively harmful to the structure of the society because it takes this information (and therefore power) away from the viewers.\n\n*Cover Photo Credit: *[*Business of Fashion*](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/influencer-marketing-fraud-buying-followers)\n", "timestamp": 1623897119, "digest": "S94Y9NCcY67vnZvc-W4EV28RArgPH3WwsQQPCi263FA", "contributor": "0x30E838D51c61811d382962B4e0699715462DcdE1"}
