The Summit is an opportunity to bring two worlds together, the vibrant Creator Economy and the dynamic world of Crypto. \n\nLearn more about the [Creator x Crypto Summit](http://www.summit.seedclub.io) here. \n\nNFTs, Social tokens, DAOs, and the uncertainties that come with it all are the topics we‚Äôll dive into with some of the leading thinkers from both sides of the web 2.0 / web 3.0 divide. You won't want to miss it ([so register here](http://summit.seedclub.io)). \n\n### Hold NFT = Sponsor the Summit  \n\nWe‚Äôre excited to announce our Summit Sponsorship NFTs. We‚Äôve put 3 NFTs up for auction on Zora, with each NFT representing sponsorship for one day.\n\nWe‚Äôre big fans of the utility that social tokens and NFTs bring to communities, and it‚Äôs a natural fit for us to include NFT‚Äôs as part of our Summit roll out. \n\n\n### We‚Äôre auctioning off one NFT for each day of the Summit. \n\nThe purchaser of the NFT is essentially ‚Äúunlocking‚Äù the content for everyone that day. No tickets, no paywalls, no gates. The NFT holder will get all the thanks, accolades and admiration from our growing community and the thousands of watchers around the world. As a sponsor of Seed Club‚Äôs FIRST Creator x Crypto Summit, your NFT will also be immutable proof that you were one of the pioneers who helped launch this premier event.\n\n### What Sponsors Get\n\nWinning the NFT auction will entitle each sponsor to the following for the corresponding summit days:\n\n- Be the named sponsor (name + logo) of each day (on our website, the live stream and in Discord). \n- The opportunity to host a 30-minute session as a capstone for each day. (You better make it good because it‚Äôs at the end of the day!!)\n- A bunch of attention and thanks from the various Seed Club social media channels (Twitter, Discord, email).\n- Recognition as an early Seed Club supporter (and all that entails ‚Ä¶ which is mostly just bragging rights for now, but we plan to make it  be something in the future).\n\n\n### About the NFTs\n\nOne of our earliest supporters, one of the earliest issuers of a Social Token, and really an early adopter of NFTs (man, this guy is early) is [Connie Digital] (https://twitter.com/ConnieDigital). Connie brings his unique DIGITAL vibes to every piece he creates and we asked him to bring those same vibes to the creation of three Sponsorship NFTs. \n\nYou can view and bid on the collection here, or scroll to the end of this page.\n\n### Auction Details. \n\n- Auction will close on Friday March 26th at 6pm Pacific Time. \n- Winners will be chosen by the Seed Club team (we reserve the right not to choose the highest bid).\n- Winners will need to reach out to the Seed Club Twitter and provide proof of ownership prior to unlocking full sponsorship benefits.\n\nQuestions or comments.
