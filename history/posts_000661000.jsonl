I am the Chair of the organization. I am excited about Tech:NYC’s work to bring the ongoing NYC Mayoral race to the tech sector.\n\nOn Thursday, April 8th (tomorrow) at 4pmET, Tech:NYC will host a webinar with the top mayoral candidates that is open to all NYC tech employees. The candidates participating are Eric Adams, Shaun Donovan, Kathryn Garcia, Ray McGuire, Scott Stringer, Maya Wiley, and Andrew Yang. The forum will be moderated by Josh Barro. The [NYC Mayoral Forum](https://technyc-org.zoom.us/webinar/register/6316177224414/WN_MsebLPxKSy2RqNT5ONkDPA) is hosted by Tech:NYC and Warby Parker and is co-hosted by AT\\&T, Bowery Farming, Etsy, Harry’s, Via, WeWork, Zola, and more.\n\nTech:NYC did a [poll](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/568af8d2d82d5e25a610856b/t/6048ec1e08a8d946cca43b49/1615391774450/Change+Research+Poll+of+New+Yorkers+Who+Work+in+Tech+Executive+Summary.pdf) of NYC tech employees earlier this year and it showed that the New Yorkers who work in tech largely care about the things that all New Yorkers care about. People are attracted to NYC because of its diversity, cultural institutions, subway, etc. – the things that make NYC NYC. And they care about their neighborhoods, schools, parks, quality of life, etc.\n\nThe poll also showed that lots of people in tech care about the mayoral race – 87% said they plan to vote in the primary.\n\nSo the [NYC Mayoral Forum](https://technyc-org.zoom.us/webinar/register/6316177224414/WN_MsebLPxKSy2RqNT5ONkDPA) is a great way for tech employees to get engaged in a race that really matters to the future of our city as we look to recover from COVID.

{"id": "a_9h5ZrWTGjVNX1ezeFSNbgClptw0u89ePkHU1Rr8e0", "title": "CROWDFUND A $NOVEL: BURN ALPHA", "body": "***NOTE: This crowdfund is not yet live, but it will be soon! For updates on when it goes live, follow me on Twitter at @khole_emily***\n\nWelcome to a new experiment: using crypto to crowdfund my new novel, working title BURN ALPHA. The supporters of $NOVEL would be the first of their kind, since no other novels have ever been created this way, in the history of literary culture :) \n\nUsually, novelists go to great lengths to fund their own novel-writing process by working other gigs, selling commercial writing, or – in significantly fewer cases – getting an advance from a publishing company. All of these methods have drawbacks, in the forms of limited time or limited creative freedom for the author. On top of that, the process of creating these works of art goes on behind a veil of secrecy, away from the community that will ultimately enjoy the final product. As an author and publisher, I’d like to change all that. This crowdfund will take us one step closer to a better future for writers and readers everywhere. \n\nI am so stoked to immerse myself more deeply in writing my second book and to share it with all of you.\n\nPhew! Without further ado...\n\n\n\n### The Book:\n\nMy novel-in-progress BURN ALPHA is a homoerotic teen thriller about a group of three girls at an elite New York City private school who stumble into busting a global sex trafficking ring related to their school and ultimately shut the school down, set in the mid-2000s in NYC. There is also an esoteric/supernatural element that informs how they gather information and fight the power – that part is related to Goetic magic, but it wouldn’t be very occult if I spilled it all here. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4c4c8322-1fa8-4d91-a8f8-629d56413991.png?height=1630&width=1056)\n\nThe book-writing process was inspired by my fascination with the [very strange, real 1973 Sci Fi book Space Relations by Donald Barr](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvgpm3/epstein-truthers-are-obsessed-with-a-sci-fi-book-about-child-sex-slavery-written-by-bill-barrs-dad) – who was the headmaster of the Dalton School in New York where Jeffrey Epstein got his first gig (incidentally, Epstein was my mom’s high school math teacher). \n\n![](https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d56c6ec4d02ea00084d5162/lede/1565968446993-0-5.jpeg)\n\n\n\nThe vibe of BURN ALPHA is candy critique: Q Anon meets Umberto Eco meets Gossip Girl. My first novel was Mercury Retrograde (2020), which was a New York Times New and Notable Book (!) and was released through [Deluge](delugebooks.com), a press I run with collaborators in New York and Los Angeles ([more press links and info here](delugebooks.com/pages/links)). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/df270ae5-1111-4265-bf77-4619d1a2213e.png?height=1078&width=1072)\n\n\nBURN ALPHA would be the second installment in a series of fictional works I’m doing about power structures and how they shift or collapse. I want to crowdfund so I have uninterrupted time for world building and funds to work with the excellent editors in the Deluge network. I’m also trying to learn-by-doing in order to explore new models for publishing overall. This process will help me check out new structures for authors I publish through Deluge, and the larger community of queer, experimental, literary writers of which I am a part. \n\nI’m excited about crowdfunding and the world of social tokens because they open up new ideas about how writing can be generated, published and sustained. The world needs an attitude adjustment when it comes how books are made, sold, and distributed, and writers have been waiting too long for better ways of working at better rates. (Platforms like Substack can show us a little of what might change but are only a drop in the bucket...they are also kinda hybrid old- and new-generation in a way that feels limp to me.) Therefore, this experiment is one part of figuring out what does and doesn’t work! \n\nAnd luckily, since I run [my own press](delugebooks.com), we already know that this book will hit bookshelves (and e-readers) worldwide once it’s ready!\n\n\n## BURN ALPHA $NOVEL supporters would receive:  \n\n### TIER ONE: Everyone\n\n- Stake in manuscript excerpt from Act 1 of BURN ALPHA which will be posted on Mirror and minted as NFT\n- Stake in of the first edition NFT sale of the full book (this comes later, of course)\n- Mention in the book’s acknowledgments, along with my massive gratitude!\n\n### TIER TWO: .5 ETH +\n\nAll of the above, plus...\n\n- Special supporter-only limited edition hardcover copy of BURN ALPHA\n- Limited edition supporter-only BURN ALPHA merch\n- Access to periodic supporter-only readings of manuscript in process\n\n\n### TIER THREE: 1.5 ETH +\n\nAll of the above, plus...\n\n- One on one call with me: either a chat about writing, a chat about whatever is on your mind, or a tarot / astrology reading \n- Sneak peek of the full finished manuscript before anyone else\n\n \n\n### Here are the basic mechanics:\nThe initial manuscript excerpt will exist on Mirror, publicly accessible to all. It will be minted as an NFT utilizing the Zora protocol. Supporters retain a stake in both the manuscript excerpt and full manuscript NFTs. Any time these NFTs are sold, a percentage goes back to the token holders, who can then redeem them for a proportional share of ETH in the shared pool. The first edition book is minted as an NFT from the crowdfund, the future value of which routes back to the crowdfund and therefore the supporters. Supporters will forever be linked to the crowdfund as patrons that made this project (and the future of literary fiction) possible.\n\n \n### More about the BURN ALPHA story:\n\nThe three girls at the heart of the story are Elizabeth Macabee, Gillian Shapiro and Archer Fast. Archer is the daughter of a major American political dynasty and also happens to have the headmaster of their school for a father. Gillian is the child of a Goldman Sachs investment banker and Israeli emigre psychoanalyst – though her upper Madison Ave. meets East Hampton set up should make her a shoe-in for popular girl, but her queerness (as yet unarticulated) and body type (not thin enough) preclude this, so she ends up working an alternative angle of social capital: cool clothes, music knowledge, humor, and drugs. Elizabeth, understated and sardonic, is the least privileged of the three, though hardly poor in any consensus reality idea of the term. Raised on the Upper West Side by her academic parents, she is shielded from the high octane world of elite private schools (xoxo) for a good portion of her childhood. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ec4a1a29-dcab-4751-a2d3-84e015f20b19.png?height=848&width=854)\n\nFor most of that period, Elizabeth’s mom is a PhD candidate in the sociology department at Columbia studying the network effects of a Panama Papers-type cabal of offshore accounts among the world’s wealthiest people. This eventually trickles up to the school’s trustees, who don’t like it. Elizabeth’s mom gets gaslit out of her grad program and has a psychotic break which includes her murdering the family dog – Elizabeth discovers them both covered with blood on the black-and-white tiled bathroom floor of their apartment on 106th Street. After Elizabeth’s mom emerges from the psych ward, she is totally blackpilled and utterly exhausted by the idea of fighting the power in any form. That’s when she sends Elizabeth crosstown to the ultra-tony Salisbury School, where she intends for her daughter to meld with the elite. Elizabeth’s friendship with Archer and Gillian pleases her in this vein, though if she knew about their daily after school ritual, she would likely be less happy: three girls smoking lots of weed-laced-with-bits-of-PCP in Central Park by the Met. It is during one of those wavy afternoons that the girls slip into another nearby realm, where a piece of information is revealed to them in the form of a crumbling old book. That book implicates Archer’s family and the whole school they attend in a global sex trafficking ring (yes, Epstein-esque, but as if the 2008 Epstein bust was the whole kit and kaboodle, not a slap on the wrist). You’ll have to read the rest of BURN ALPHA to find out what happens!\n\n\n## More about me:\n\nI’m a writer, artist, and trend forecaster based in Los Angeles. Some of you might know me as one of the co-founders of [K-HOLE](khole.net), the trend forecasting group best known for popularizing normcore, or as part of [Nemesis](nemesis.global), a consultancy I run with Martti Kalliala. My first book, Mercury Retrograde, was released in November 2020 by [Deluge Books](delugebooks.com), a mass experimental queer press I founded with collaborators in New York and LA. My writing has appeared in The Guardian, Frieze, Texte zur Kunst, Flash Art, Dazed, Mousse, 032c, e-flux journal, and many other publications, including anthologies by Verso Books and Sternberg Press. I’ve presented portions of my first novel-in-progress in art contexts at Project Native Informant in London, the Witte de With Contemporary Art Center in Rotterdam, the Berlin Biennial, the Serpentine Gallery, and elsewhere, so this crowdfund would be a further iteration of an existing exploration into opening up the novel-writing process in unexpected avenues :)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6f6555cb-298e-4921-b421-52b5146c8928.jpg?height=2291&width=1535)\n\n\n\nYou can find me on Twitter at @khole_emily, on Instagram at @nemesis_emily, on my web site at [emilysegal.net](emilysegal.net) and if you'd like to drop me a note, I'm reachable at emily@delugebooks.com\n \n## Praise for my first book:\n\n“Emily Segal is **almost mystically attuned to the cultural logic of our era**. She lives its pangs and contradictions intellectually, emotionally and somatically – late capitalism’s Simone Weil.” Tom McCarthy\n\n“I really liked reading this book. It’s the longest reply to “where have you been?” you’ll ever get from someone you first met in a skype chat which Emily Segal is to me. It’s **a brilliantly written novel** of a moment in search of a shimmer, half ‘here’, half digital, an everywhere post branding workplace place where few have dared to live and this writer, explorer, critic, philosopher of nonbusiness has done it deep. Segal's style is widely smart, different than deep (always). I mean her Mercury Retrograde is, it truly is.” Eileen Myles \n\n“‘Mercury Retrograde’ to me feels like **fiction's next historical leap**. It's smart and engaging (and bingeable) and yet it also feels necessary in a way that almost all books don't. It's a signpost that points to where the culture is headed, which is heady stuff, yet there you have it.” Douglas Coupland \n\n“I had so much fun reading it. It’s so fucking smart. It’s like **a love story between a girl and her intellect**. And it’s so cool to be all up in there with her.”  Michelle Tea\n \n“A thought-provoking and often extremely funny first novel looking back at the 2010s, which I couldn't put down. I should also say this book offered some very cathartic **food-for-thought on the strange ways capital, cultural capital, and the Internet interacted in the 10s,** for those of you who are still haunted by trying to make sense of it all.” Emilie Friedlander, VICE\n\n“**Dripping with line-level genius juice.**” M.E.S.H.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f134c960-788f-40c4-a89c-0c7eb66126ce.jpeg?height=2049&width=1536)\n\n\n## ADDITIONAL REFERENCES:\n\n[Crowdfunding Writing with NFTs — Mirror](https://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ)\n\n[Crowdfund Block on Mirror](https://dev.mirror.xyz/igPh3OWGfT3ERv16GZdyQeI7t3FdkK-8zsKlHKSX-lc) \n\n[$GENERALIST](https://generalist.mirror.xyz/1T0h7VGDcECJuifK4TPDfRoUQ3zaO_tPwdZV-dtnNqw)\n\n[$ESSAY](https://j.mirror.xyz/uVGCCwwm3k341lPpxaJmHTZROESVse9Pe_rmbiuUAC0)\n\n[$MOOD](https://appliedarts.mirror.xyz/vbiD5sIgZaqUAuXu0P6SkvmCNOM7MtRCdqsEDyxsOXU)\n \n \n\n\n", "timestamp": 1617811581, "digest": "0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg", "contributor": "0xDA18e1537622802EC576D99A8e3913914653BD6F"}

There is also an esoteric/supernatural element that informs how they gather information and fight the power – that part is related to Goetic magic, but it wouldn’t be very occult if I spilled it all here. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4c4c8322-1fa8-4d91-a8f8-629d56413991.png?height=1630&width=1056)\n\nThe book-writing process was inspired by my fascination with the [very strange, real 1973 Sci Fi book Space Relations by Donald Barr](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvgpm3/epstein-truthers-are-obsessed-with-a-sci-fi-book-about-child-sex-slavery-written-by-bill-barrs-dad) – who was the headmaster of the Dalton School in New York where Jeffrey Epstein got his first gig (incidentally, Epstein was my mom’s high school math teacher). \n\n![](https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d56c6ec4d02ea00084d5162/lede/1565968446993-0-5.jpeg)\n\n\n\nThe vibe of BURN ALPHA is candy critique: Q Anon meets Umberto Eco meets Gossip Girl. My first novel was Mercury Retrograde (2020), which was a New York Times New and Notable Book (!) and was released through [Deluge](delugebooks.com), a press I run with collaborators in New York and Los Angeles ([more press links and info here](delugebooks.com/pages/links)). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/df270ae5-1111-4265-bf77-4619d1a2213e.png?height=1078&width=1072)\n\n\nBURN ALPHA would be the second installment in a series of fictional works I’m doing about power structures and how they shift or collapse. I want to crowdfund so I have uninterrupted time for world building and funds to work with the excellent editors in the Deluge network. I’m also trying to learn-by-doing in order to explore new models for publishing overall. This process will help me check out new structures for authors I publish through Deluge, and the larger community of queer, experimental, literary writers of which I am a part. \n\nI’m excited about crowdfunding and the world of social tokens because they open up new ideas about how writing can be generated, published and sustained. The world needs an attitude adjustment when it comes to how books are made, sold, and distributed, and writers have been waiting too long for better ways of working at better rates. (Platforms like Substack can show us a little of what might change but are only a drop in the bucket...they are also kinda hybrid old- and new-generation in a way that feels limp to me.) Therefore, this experiment is one part of figuring out what does and doesn’t work! \n\nAnd luckily, since I run [my own press](delugebooks.com), we already know that this book will hit bookshelves (and e-readers) worldwide once it’s ready!\n\n\n## BURN ALPHA $NOVEL supporters would receive:  \n\n### TIER ONE: Everyone\n\n- Stake in manuscript excerpt from Act 1 of BURN ALPHA which will be posted on Mirror and minted as NFT\n- Stake in of the first edition NFT sale of the full book (this comes later, of course)\n- Mention in the book’s acknowledgments, along with my massive gratitude!\n\n### TIER TWO: .5 ETH +\n\nAll of the above, plus...\n\n- Special supporter-only limited edition hardcover copy of BURN ALPHA\n- Limited edition supporter-only BURN ALPHA merch\n- Access to periodic supporter-only readings of manuscript in process\n\n\n### TIER THREE: 1.5 ETH +\n\nAll of the above, plus...\n\nOne on one call with me: either a chat about writing, a chat about whatever is on your mind, or a tarot / astrology reading \n\nSneak peek of the full finished manuscript before anyone else\n\n \n\n### Here are the basic mechanics:\nThe initial manuscript excerpt will exist on Mirror, publicly accessible to all. It will be minted as an NFT utilizing the Zora protocol. Supporters retain a stake in both the manuscript excerpt and full manuscript NFTs. Any time these NFTs are sold, a percentage goes back to the token holders, who can then redeem them for a proportional share of ETH in the shared pool. The first edition book is minted as an NFT from the crowdfund, the future value of which routes back to the crowdfund and therefore the supporters. Supporters will forever be linked to the crowdfund as patrons that made this project (and the future of literary fiction) possible.\n\n \n### More about the BURN ALPHA story:\n\nThe three girls at the heart of the story are Elizabeth Macabee, Gillian Shapiro and Archer Fast. Archer is the daughter of a major American political dynasty and also happens to have the headmaster of their school for a father. Gillian is the child of a Goldman Sachs investment banker and Israeli emigre psychoanalyst – though her upper Madison Ave. meets East Hampton set up should make her a shoe-in for popular girl, but her queerness (as yet unarticulated) and body type (not thin enough) preclude this, so she ends up working an alternative angle of social capital: cool clothes, music knowledge, humor, and drugs. Elizabeth, understated and sardonic, is the least privileged of the three, though hardly poor in any consensus reality idea of the term. Raised on the Upper West Side by her academic parents, she is shielded from the high octane world of elite private schools (xoxo) for a good portion of her childhood. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ec4a1a29-dcab-4751-a2d3-84e015f20b19.png?height=848&width=854)\n\nFor most of that period, Elizabeth’s mom is a PhD candidate in the sociology department at Columbia studying the network effects of a Panama Papers-type cabal of offshore accounts among the world’s wealthiest people. This eventually trickles up to the school’s trustees, who don’t like it. Elizabeth’s mom gets gaslit out of her grad program and has a psychotic break which includes her murdering the family dog – Elizabeth discovers them both covered with blood on the black-and-white tiled bathroom floor of their apartment on 106th Street. After Elizabeth’s mom emerges from the psych ward, she is totally blackpilled and utterly exhausted by the idea of fighting the power in any form. That’s when she sends Elizabeth crosstown to the ultra-tony Salisbury School, where she intends for her daughter to meld with the elite. Elizabeth’s friendship with Archer and Gillian pleases her in this vein, though if she knew about their daily after school ritual, she would likely be less happy: three girls smoking lots of weed-laced-with-bits-of-PCP in Central Park by the Met. It is during one of those wavy afternoons that the girls slip into another nearby realm, where a piece of information is revealed to them in the form of a crumbling old book. That book implicates Archer’s family and the whole school they attend in a global sex trafficking ring (yes, Epstein-esque, but as if the 2008 Epstein bust was the whole kit and kaboodle, not a slap on the wrist). You’ll have to read the rest of BURN ALPHA to find out what happens!\n\n\n## More about me:\n\nI’m a writer, artist, and trend forecaster based in Los Angeles. Some of you might know me as one of the co-founders of [K-HOLE](khole.net), the trend forecasting group best known for popularizing normcore, or as part of [Nemesis](nemesis.global), a consultancy I run with Martti Kalliala. My first book, Mercury Retrograde, was released in November 2020 by [Deluge Books](delugebooks.com), a mass experimental queer press I founded with collaborators in New York and LA. My writing has appeared in The Guardian, Frieze, Texte zur Kunst, Flash Art, Dazed, Mousse, 032c, e-flux journal, and many other publications, including anthologies by Verso Books and Sternberg Press. I’ve presented portions of my first novel-in-progress in art contexts at Project Native Informant in London, the Witte de With Contemporary Art Center in Rotterdam, the Berlin Biennial, the Serpentine Gallery, and elsewhere, so this crowdfund would be a further iteration of an existing exploration into opening up the novel-writing process in unexpected avenues :)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6f6555cb-298e-4921-b421-52b5146c8928.jpg?height=2291&width=1535)\n\n\n\nYou can find me on Twitter at @khole_emily, on Instagram at @nemesis_emily, on my web site at [emilysegal.net](emilysegal.net) and if you'd like to drop me a note, I'm reachable at emily@delugebooks.com\n \n## Praise for my first book:\n\n“Emily Segal is **almost mystically attuned to the cultural logic of our era**. She lives its pangs and contradictions intellectually, emotionally and somatically – late capitalism’s Simone Weil.” Tom McCarthy\n\n“I really liked reading this book. It’s the longest reply to “where have you been?” you’ll ever get from someone you first met in a skype chat which Emily Segal is to me. It’s **a brilliantly written novel** of a moment in search of a shimmer, half ‘here’, half digital, an everywhere post branding workplace place where few have dared to live and this writer, explorer, critic, philosopher of nonbusiness has done it deep. Segal's style is widely smart, different than deep (always). I mean her Mercury Retrograde is, it truly is.” Eileen Myles \n\n“‘Mercury Retrograde’ to me feels like **fiction's next historical leap**. It's smart and engaging (and bingeable) and yet it also feels necessary in a way that almost all books don't. It's a signpost that points to where the culture is headed, which is heady stuff, yet there you have it.” Douglas Coupland \n\n“I had so much fun reading it. It’s so fucking smart. It’s like **a love story between a girl and her intellect**. And it’s so cool to be all up in there with her.”  Michelle Tea\n \n“A thought-provoking and often extremely funny first novel looking back at the 2010s, which I couldn't put down. I should also say this book offered some very cathartic **food-for-thought on the strange ways capital, cultural capital, and the Internet interacted in the 10s,** for those of you who are still haunted by trying to make sense of it all.” Emilie Friedlander, VICE\n\n“**Dripping with line-level genius juice.**” M.E.S.H.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f134c960-788f-40c4-a89c-0c7eb66126ce.jpeg?height=2049&width=1536)\n\n\n## ADDITIONAL REFERENCES:\n\n[Crowdfunding Writing with NFTs — Mirror](https://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ)\n\n[Crowdfund Block on Mirror](https://dev.mirror.xyz/igPh3OWGfT3ERv16GZdyQeI7t3FdkK-8zsKlHKSX-lc) \n\n[$GENERALIST](https://generalist.mirror.xyz/1T0h7VGDcECJuifK4TPDfRoUQ3zaO_tPwdZV-dtnNqw)\n\n[$ESSAY](https://j.mirror.xyz/uVGCCwwm3k341lPpxaJmHTZROESVse9Pe_rmbiuUAC0)\n\n[$MOOD](https://appliedarts.mirror.xyz/vbiD5sIgZaqUAuXu0P6SkvmCNOM7MtRCdqsEDyxsOXU)\n \n \n\n\n", "timestamp": 1617815190, "digest": "0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg", "contributor": "0xDA18e1537622802EC576D99A8e3913914653BD6F"}

Archer is the daughter of a major American political dynasty and also happens to have the headmaster of their school for a father. Gillian is the child of a Goldman Sachs investment banker and Israeli emigre psychoanalyst – though her upper Madison Ave. meets East Hampton set up should make her a shoe-in for popular girl, but her queerness (as yet unarticulated) and body type (not thin enough) preclude this, so she ends up working an alternative angle of social capital: cool clothes, music knowledge, humor, and drugs. Elizabeth, understated and sardonic, is the least privileged of the three, though hardly poor in any consensus reality idea of the term. Raised on the Upper West Side by her academic parents, she is shielded from the high octane world of elite private schools (xoxo) for a good portion of her childhood. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ec4a1a29-dcab-4751-a2d3-84e015f20b19.png?height=848&width=854)\n\nFor most of that period, Elizabeth’s mom is a PhD candidate in the sociology department at Columbia studying the network effects of a Panama Papers-type cabal of offshore accounts among the world’s wealthiest people. This eventually trickles up to the school’s trustees, who don’t like it. Elizabeth’s mom gets gaslit out of her grad program and has a psychotic break which includes her murdering the family dog – Elizabeth discovers them both covered with blood on the black-and-white tiled bathroom floor of their apartment on 106th Street. After Elizabeth’s mom emerges from the psych ward, she is totally blackpilled and utterly exhausted by the idea of fighting the power in any form. That’s when she sends Elizabeth crosstown to the ultra-tony Salisbury School, where she intends for her daughter to meld with the elite. Elizabeth’s friendship with Archer and Gillian pleases her in this vein, though if she knew about their daily after school ritual, she would likely be less happy: three girls smoking lots of weed-laced-with-bits-of-PCP in Central Park by the Met. It is during one of those wavy afternoons that the girls slip into another nearby realm, where a piece of information is revealed to them in the form of a crumbling old book. That book implicates Archer’s family and the whole school they attend in a global sex trafficking ring (yes, Epstein-esque, but as if the 2008 Epstein bust was the whole kit and kaboodle, not a slap on the wrist). You’ll have to read the rest of BURN ALPHA to find out what happens!\n\n\n## More about me:\n\nI’m a writer, artist, and trend forecaster based in Los Angeles. Some of you might know me as one of the co-founders of [K-HOLE](khole.net), the trend forecasting group best known for popularizing normcore, or as part of [Nemesis](nemesis.global), a consultancy I run with Martti Kalliala. My first book, Mercury Retrograde, was released in November 2020 by [Deluge Books](delugebooks.com), a mass experimental queer press I founded with collaborators in New York and LA. My writing has appeared in The Guardian, Frieze, Texte zur Kunst, Flash Art, Dazed, Mousse, 032c, e-flux journal, and many other publications, including anthologies by Verso Books and Sternberg Press. I’ve presented portions of my first novel-in-progress in art contexts at Project Native Informant in London, the Witte de With Contemporary Art Center in Rotterdam, the Berlin Biennial, the Serpentine Gallery, and elsewhere, so this crowdfund would be a further iteration of an existing exploration into opening up the novel-writing process in unexpected avenues :)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6f6555cb-298e-4921-b421-52b5146c8928.jpg?height=2291&width=1535)\n\n\n\nYou can find me on Twitter at @khole_emily, on Instagram at @nemesis_emily, on my web site at [emilysegal.net](emilysegal.net) and if you'd like to drop me a note, I'm reachable at emily@delugebooks.com\n \n## Praise for my first book:\n\n“Emily Segal is **almost mystically attuned to the cultural logic of our era**. She lives its pangs and contradictions intellectually, emotionally and somatically – late capitalism’s Simone Weil.” Tom McCarthy\n\n“I really liked reading this book. It’s the longest reply to “where have you been?” you’ll ever get from someone you first met in a skype chat which Emily Segal is to me. It’s **a brilliantly written novel** of a moment in search of a shimmer, half ‘here’, half digital, an everywhere post branding workplace place where few have dared to live and this writer, explorer, critic, philosopher of nonbusiness has done it deep. Segal's style is widely smart, different than deep (always). I mean her Mercury Retrograde is, it truly is.” Eileen Myles \n\n“‘Mercury Retrograde’ to me feels like **fiction's next historical leap**. It's smart and engaging (and bingeable) and yet it also feels necessary in a way that almost all books don't. It's a signpost that points to where the culture is headed, which is heady stuff, yet there you have it.” Douglas Coupland \n\n“I had so much fun reading it. It’s so fucking smart. It’s like **a love story between a girl and her intellect**. And it’s so cool to be all up in there with her.”  Michelle Tea\n \n“A thought-provoking and often extremely funny first novel looking back at the 2010s, which I couldn't put down.

For updates on when it goes live, follow me on Twitter at @khole_emily***\n\nWelcome to a new experiment: using crypto to crowdfund my new novel, working title BURN ALPHA. The supporters of $NOVEL would be the first of their kind, since no other novels have ever been created this way, in the history of literary culture :) \n\nUsually, novelists go to great lengths to fund their own novel-writing process by working other gigs, selling commercial writing, or – in significantly fewer cases – getting an advance from a publishing company. All of these methods have drawbacks, in the forms of limited time or limited creative freedom for the author. On top of that, the process of creating these works of art goes on behind a veil of secrecy, away from the community that will ultimately enjoy the final product. As an author and publisher, I’d like to change all that. This crowdfund will take us one step closer to a better future for writers and readers everywhere. \n\nI am so stoked to immerse myself more deeply in writing my second book and to share it with all of you.\n\nPhew! Without further ado...\n\n\n\n### The Book:\n\nMy novel-in-progress BURN ALPHA is a homoerotic teen thriller about a group of three girls at an elite New York City private school who stumble into busting a global sex trafficking ring related to their school and ultimately shut the school down, set in the mid-2000s in NYC. There is also an esoteric/supernatural element that informs how they gather information and fight the power – that part is related to Goetic magic, but it wouldn’t be very occult if I spilled it all here. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4c4c8322-1fa8-4d91-a8f8-629d56413991.png?height=1630&width=1056)\n\nThe book-writing process was inspired by my fascination with the [very strange, real 1973 Sci Fi book Space Relations by Donald Barr](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvgpm3/epstein-truthers-are-obsessed-with-a-sci-fi-book-about-child-sex-slavery-written-by-bill-barrs-dad) – who was the headmaster of the Dalton School in New York where Jeffrey Epstein got his first gig (incidentally, Epstein was my mom’s high school math teacher). \n\n![](https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d56c6ec4d02ea00084d5162/lede/1565968446993-0-5.jpeg)\n\n\n\nThe vibe of BURN ALPHA is candy critique: Q Anon meets Umberto Eco meets Gossip Girl. My first novel was Mercury Retrograde (2020), which was a New York Times New and Notable Book (!) and was released through [Deluge](delugebooks.com), a press I run with collaborators in New York and Los Angeles ([more press links and info here](delugebooks.com/pages/links)). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/df270ae5-1111-4265-bf77-4619d1a2213e.png?height=1078&width=1072)\n\n\nBURN ALPHA would be the second installment in a series of fictional works I’m doing about power structures and how they shift or collapse. I want to crowdfund so I have uninterrupted time for world building and funds to work with the excellent editors in the Deluge network. I’m also trying to learn-by-doing in order to explore new models for publishing overall. This process will help me check out new structures for authors I publish through Deluge, and the larger community of queer, experimental, literary writers of which I am a part. \n\nI’m excited about crowdfunding and the world of social tokens because they open up new ideas about how writing can be generated, published and sustained. The world needs an attitude adjustment when it comes to how books are made, sold, and distributed, and writers have been waiting too long for better ways of working at better rates. (Platforms like Substack can show us a little of what might change but are only a drop in the bucket...they are also kinda hybrid old- and new-generation in a way that feels limp to me.) Therefore, this experiment is one part of figuring out what does and doesn’t work! \n\nAnd luckily, since I run [my own press](delugebooks.com) we already know that this book will hit bookshelves (and e-readers) worldwide once it’s ready!\n\n\n## BURN ALPHA $NOVEL supporters would receive:  \n\n### TIER ONE: Everyone\n\n- Stake in manuscript excerpt from Act 1 of BURN ALPHA which will be posted on Mirror and minted as NFT\n- Stake in of the first edition NFT sale of the full book (this comes later, of course)\n- Mention in the book’s acknowledgments, along with my massive gratitude!\n\n### TIER TWO: .5 ETH +\n\nAll of the above, plus...\n\n- Special supporter-only limited edition hardcover copy of BURN ALPHA\n- Limited edition supporter-only BURN ALPHA merch\n- Access to periodic supporter-only readings of manuscript in process\n\n\n### TIER THREE: 1.5 ETH +\n\nAll of the above, plus...\n\nOne on one call with me: either a chat about writing, a chat about whatever is on your mind, or a tarot / astrology reading \n\nSneak peek of the full finished manuscript before anyone else\n\n \n\n### Here are the basic mechanics:\nThe initial manuscript excerpt will exist on Mirror, publicly accessible to all. It will be minted as an NFT utilizing the Zora protocol. Supporters retain a stake in both the manuscript excerpt and full manuscript NFTs. Any time these NFTs are sold, a percentage goes back to the token holders, who can then redeem them for a proportional share of ETH in the shared pool. The first edition book is minted as an NFT from the crowdfund, the future value of which routes back to the crowdfund and therefore the supporters. Supporters will forever be linked to the crowdfund as patrons that made this project (and the future of literary fiction) possible.\n\n \n### More about the BURN ALPHA story:\n\nThe three girls at the heart of the story are Elizabeth Macabee, Gillian Shapiro and Archer Fast.

{"id": "q95PfjXaswedFdAWViut9jUzTHcbMe6wBi0IIXzPYZU", "title": "DeFi's Two Cultures", "body": "There are two cultures in the DeFi space. Not a perfectly clean divide, but as much of [two cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures) as you can have.\n\nLet's call one side *Left* and one side *Right*.\n\nOn the Left side, we have heavyweight American protocols like Compound and Uniswap. The leaders of these protocols have Twitter profile photos of real people with real names. They're polite and articulate. They're from Wharton and Columbia and they live in NYC or SF. They're backed by a16z and USV. They're audited by Trail of Bits and never require more than one or two revisions. You get the idea.\n\nOn the Right side, we have international heavyweights like Aave, Yearn, Synthetix and Chainlink. Many of the Twitter personalities here are more likely to be anonymous. Their grammar often seems full of intentional mistakes. They have armies of green frog followers. They're scorned as \"toxic anons\".\n\nThe most aggressive conflict that I've seen between these two sides has been over Compound's oracle system. An oracle system provides price feeds to protocols, which are used for many things - particularly liquidations on lending protocols.\n\nCompound uses Coinbase and Uniswap as its oracle feed (just as you might expect) and Aave uses Chainlink. The Chainlink community deployed its army of frogs to try to persuade Compound to use Chainlink, but this aggravated the Compound community, and harsh words were said (by the Left's standards). Joey Krug said he would all dump his COMP and remove all 0x from the protocol if Compound integrated Chainlink. Leshner said some biting things.\n\nAnd then, one day, Coinbase's price feed massively mispriced DAI because of large specific activity on Coinbase. Many Compound users were liquidated because of this, and there was even a proposal to use Compound reserves to repay the victims (which didn't pass). Chainlink gloated. But still, no integration.\n\nBut over time, Chainlink has become a multibillion dollar protocol ($27bn fully diluted), and might be the foremost experts now on oracles indeed. \n\nIt looks like the Compound community is [really considering an integration](https://www.comp.xyz/t/oracle-infrastructure-chainlink-proposal/1272/40).\n\nKyle Samani once made the point in a tweet that the winner here (Right vs Left) could come down to how the US decides to regulate crypto. Purchasing an index like DPI will give exposure to both without bias.\n\nAnother related, controversial element is around \"fair launches\" (e.g. the Yearn launch) vs VC capital (e.g. Uniswap's traditional VC rounds). There have been many subtweets between the two sides around what is appropriate for crypto and what is healthier for development. It'll be interesting to see how this evolves, and where funds like Polychain are perceived (e.g. Polychain made a big investment in Yearn after their launch, as opposed to having participated in a closed seed round).\n\nThe point is that, crypto might be open, permissionless infrastructure where code is perceived as law, but there's still many cultural biases involved. These create all kinds of effects around perception of trust. The mutual cooperation of these two cultures and the safe integration of protocols would be ideal, but might also be difficult for these reasons.", "timestamp": 1617825256, "digest": "KJFMrrKHwv2pAygNy3WFEcICSgHISOPn8EWeJYR_YOc", "contributor": "0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026"}

There is also an esoteric/supernatural element that informs how they gather information and fight the power – that part is related to Goetic magic, but it wouldn’t be very occult if I spilled it all here. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4c4c8322-1fa8-4d91-a8f8-629d56413991.png?height=1630&width=1056)\n\nThe book-writing process was inspired by my fascination with the [very strange, real 1973 Sci Fi book Space Relations by Donald Barr](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvgpm3/epstein-truthers-are-obsessed-with-a-sci-fi-book-about-child-sex-slavery-written-by-bill-barrs-dad) – who was the headmaster of the Dalton School in New York where Jeffrey Epstein got his first gig (incidentally, Epstein was my mom’s high school math teacher). \n\n![](https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d56c6ec4d02ea00084d5162/lede/1565968446993-0-5.jpeg)\n\n\n\nThe vibe of BURN ALPHA is candy critique: Q Anon meets Umberto Eco meets Gossip Girl. My first novel was [Mercury Retrograde (2020)](https://delugebooks.com/collections/books), which was a New York Times New and Notable Book (!) and was released through [Deluge](https://delugebooks.com/), a press I run with collaborators in New York and Los Angeles ([more press links and info here](https://delugebooks.com/pages/links)). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/df270ae5-1111-4265-bf77-4619d1a2213e.png?height=1078&width=1072)\n\n\nBURN ALPHA would be the second installment in a series of fictional works I’m doing about power structures and how they shift or collapse. I want to crowdfund so I have uninterrupted time for world building and funds to work with the excellent editors in the Deluge network. I’m also trying to learn-by-doing in order to explore new models for publishing overall. This process will help me check out new structures for authors I publish through Deluge, and the larger community of queer, experimental, literary writers of which I am a part. \n\nI’m excited about crowdfunding and the world of social tokens because they open up new ideas about how writing can be generated, published and sustained. The world needs an attitude adjustment when it comes to how books are made, sold, and distributed, and writers have been waiting too long for better ways of working at better rates. (Platforms like Substack can show us a little of what might change but are only a drop in the bucket...they are also kinda hybrid old- and new-generation in a way that feels limp to me.) Therefore, this experiment is one part of figuring out what does and doesn’t work! \n\nAnd luckily, since I run [my own press](https://delugebooks.com/) we already know that this book will hit bookshelves (and e-readers) worldwide once it’s ready!\n\n\n## BURN ALPHA $NOVEL supporters would receive:  \n\n### TIER ONE: Everyone\n\n- Stake in manuscript excerpt from Act 1 of BURN ALPHA which will be posted on Mirror and minted as NFT\n- Stake in of the first edition NFT sale of the full book (this comes later, of course)\n- Mention in the book’s acknowledgments, along with my massive gratitude!\n\n### TIER TWO: .5 ETH +\n\nAll of the above, plus...\n\n- Special supporter-only limited edition hardcover copy of BURN ALPHA\n- Limited edition supporter-only BURN ALPHA merch\n- Access to periodic supporter-only readings of manuscript in process\n\n\n### TIER THREE: 1.5 ETH +\n\nAll of the above, plus...\n\nOne on one call with me: either a chat about writing, a chat about whatever is on your mind, or a tarot / astrology reading \n\nSneak peek of the full finished manuscript before anyone else\n\n \n\n### Here are the basic mechanics:\nThe initial manuscript excerpt will exist on Mirror, publicly accessible to all. It will be minted as an NFT utilizing the Zora protocol. Supporters retain a stake in both the manuscript excerpt and full manuscript NFTs. Any time these NFTs are sold, a percentage goes back to the token holders, who can then redeem them for a proportional share of ETH in the shared pool. The first edition book is minted as an NFT from the crowdfund, the future value of which routes back to the crowdfund and therefore the supporters. Supporters will forever be linked to the crowdfund as patrons that made this project (and the future of literary fiction) possible.\n\n \n### More about the BURN ALPHA story:\n\nThe three girls at the heart of the story are Elizabeth Macabee, Gillian Shapiro and Archer Fast. Archer is the daughter of a major American political dynasty and also happens to have the headmaster of their school for a father. Gillian is the child of a Goldman Sachs investment banker and Israeli emigre psychoanalyst – though her upper Madison Ave. meets East Hampton set up should make her a shoe-in for popular girl, but her queerness (as yet unarticulated) and body type (not thin enough) preclude this, so she ends up working an alternative angle of social capital: cool clothes, music knowledge, humor, and drugs. Elizabeth, understated and sardonic, is the least privileged of the three, though hardly poor in any consensus reality idea of the term. Raised on the Upper West Side by her academic parents, she is shielded from the high octane world of elite private schools (xoxo) for a good portion of her childhood. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ec4a1a29-dcab-4751-a2d3-84e015f20b19.png?height=848&width=854)\n\nFor most of that period, Elizabeth’s mom is a PhD candidate in the sociology department at Columbia studying the network effects of a Panama Papers-type cabal of offshore accounts among the world’s wealthiest people. This eventually trickles up to the school’s trustees, who don’t like it. Elizabeth’s mom gets gaslit out of her grad program and has a psychotic break which includes her murdering the family dog – Elizabeth discovers them both covered with blood on the black-and-white tiled bathroom floor of their apartment on 106th Street. After Elizabeth’s mom emerges from the psych ward, she is totally blackpilled and utterly exhausted by the idea of fighting the power in any form. That’s when she sends Elizabeth crosstown to the ultra-tony Salisbury School, where she intends for her daughter to meld with the elite. Elizabeth’s friendship with Archer and Gillian pleases her in this vein, though if she knew about their daily after school ritual, she would likely be less happy: three girls smoking lots of weed-laced-with-bits-of-PCP in Central Park by the Met. It is during one of those wavy afternoons that the girls slip into another nearby realm, where a piece of information is revealed to them in the form of a crumbling old book. That book implicates Archer’s family and the whole school they attend in a global sex trafficking ring (yes, Epstein-esque, but as if the 2008 Epstein bust was the whole kit and kaboodle, not a slap on the wrist). You’ll have to read the rest of BURN ALPHA to find out what happens!\n\n\n## More about me:\n\nI’m a writer, artist, and trend forecaster based in Los Angeles. Some of you might know me as one of the co-founders of [K-HOLE](khole.net), the trend forecasting group best known for popularizing normcore, or as part of [Nemesis](nemesis.global), a consultancy I run with Martti Kalliala. My first book, Mercury Retrograde, was released in November 2020 by [Deluge Books](delugebooks.com), a mass experimental queer press I founded with collaborators in New York and LA. My writing has appeared in The Guardian, Frieze, Texte zur Kunst, Flash Art, Dazed, Mousse, 032c, e-flux journal, and many other publications, including anthologies by Verso Books and Sternberg Press. I’ve presented portions of my first novel-in-progress in art contexts at Project Native Informant in London, the Witte de With Contemporary Art Center in Rotterdam, the Berlin Biennial, the Serpentine Gallery, and elsewhere, so this crowdfund would be a further iteration of an existing exploration into opening up the novel-writing process in unexpected avenues :)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6f6555cb-298e-4921-b421-52b5146c8928.jpg?height=2291&width=1535)\n\n\n\nYou can find me on Twitter at @khole_emily, on Instagram at @nemesis_emily, on my web site at [emilysegal.net](emilysegal.net) and if you'd like to drop me a note, I'm reachable at emily@delugebooks.com\n \n## Praise for my first book:\n\n“Emily Segal is **almost mystically attuned to the cultural logic of our era**. She lives its pangs and contradictions intellectually, emotionally and somatically – late capitalism’s Simone Weil.” Tom McCarthy\n\n“I really liked reading this book. It’s the longest reply to “where have you been?” you’ll ever get from someone you first met in a skype chat which Emily Segal is to me. It’s **a brilliantly written novel** of a moment in search of a shimmer, half ‘here’, half digital, an everywhere post branding workplace place where few have dared to live and this writer, explorer, critic, philosopher of nonbusiness has done it deep. Segal's style is widely smart, different than deep (always). I mean her Mercury Retrograde is, it truly is.” Eileen Myles \n\n“‘Mercury Retrograde’ to me feels like **fiction's next historical leap**. It's smart and engaging (and bingeable) and yet it also feels necessary in a way that almost all books don't. It's a signpost that points to where the culture is headed, which is heady stuff, yet there you have it.” Douglas Coupland \n\n“I had so much fun reading it. It’s so fucking smart. It’s like **a love story between a girl and her intellect**. And it’s so cool to be all up in there with her.”  Michelle Tea\n \n“A thought-provoking and often extremely funny first novel looking back at the 2010s, which I couldn't put down. I should also say this book offered some very cathartic **food-for-thought on the strange ways capital, cultural capital, and the Internet interacted in the 10s,** for those of you who are still haunted by trying to make sense of it all.” Emilie Friedlander, VICE\n\n“**Dripping with line-level genius juice.**” M.E.S.H.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f134c960-788f-40c4-a89c-0c7eb66126ce.jpeg?height=2049&width=1536)\n\n\n## ADDITIONAL REFERENCES:\n\n[Crowdfunding Writing with NFTs — Mirror](https://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ)\n\n[Crowdfund Block on Mirror](https://dev.mirror.xyz/igPh3OWGfT3ERv16GZdyQeI7t3FdkK-8zsKlHKSX-lc) \n\n[$GENERALIST](https://generalist.mirror.xyz/1T0h7VGDcECJuifK4TPDfRoUQ3zaO_tPwdZV-dtnNqw)\n\n[$ESSAY](https://j.mirror.xyz/uVGCCwwm3k341lPpxaJmHTZROESVse9Pe_rmbiuUAC0)\n\n[$MOOD](https://appliedarts.mirror.xyz/vbiD5sIgZaqUAuXu0P6SkvmCNOM7MtRCdqsEDyxsOXU)\n \n \n\n\n", "timestamp": 1617835655, "digest": "0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg", "contributor": "0xDA18e1537622802EC576D99A8e3913914653BD6F"}

{"id": "il0oH549qwhTdCXJTxMDXaSFGJIHWmwpiHWI-5lLQGU", "title": "Content Communities & Digital Belonging", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/693df936-17f7-49c3-98f6-2395aff7605c.jpg?height=742&width=1320)\n\nAside from being a form of capital, technological innovation, and financial product, cryptocurrencies are also a kind of content. They have brand identities and aesthetics in the form of their logos; they gather together communities who identify with them by allowing people to hold (or hoard) bits of the brand. Cryptocurrencies also enable literal content, the way Tezos undergirds an NFT marketplace like Hic et Nunc or the tokens that support crowdfunded essays on Mirror, like $ESSAY or $MOOD. The $FWB token gathers together and supports the Friends with Benefits community. \n\nWhen I think about the connection between capital, content, and community, what comes to mind first are magazines. I've written a lot about the significance of magazines over time, profiling smaller publications like [Kinfolk](https://www.racked.com/2016/3/14/11173148/kinfolk-lifestyle-magazines) and [Monocle](https://newrepublic.com/article/143003/nowhere-mag-monocle-globalist-chic-survive-age-populism) and also analyzing the historical arc of the magazine behemoth [Conde Nast in a book review](https://newrepublic.com/article/155286/conde-nast-biography-book-review). Magazines bring together communities of readers through content that speaks to those readers and allows them to create shared frames of reference within which they can communicate with each other. (In other words, all readers of The New Yorker share the fluency in New Yorker content and its implicit depiction of a desirable lifestyle.) Magazines, like tokens, are actually really good at creating a shared sense of identity and mutual investment. The bragging right of a token is that you own a lot of it; the bragging right of a magazine is that you subscribe, or read it online often, or write for it. \n\nSuperficially, what makes up the community of a magazine is its content: the articles you read, share, and discuss partly as a way of signaling your belonging within that community. But there are other aspects that make up the content community, that don't necessarily involve reading. You keep the magazine on your coffee table, you renew your subscription because you like getting it in your mailbox — you consume the magazine's brand. Lately, The New Yorker's new run of tote bags, with the dramatically large overlapping black letters, have become omnipresent where I live in Washington, DC. The tote bags signal belonging to The New Yorker's community and thus its brand because you get one when you subscribe. \n\nHow do you signal digital belonging, or how do you express belonging in digital spaces where there are no tote bags? We've had various strategies: the Facebook like lists where you could say which bands you were into; the Twitter bios where you list affiliations, projects, or even relationships; the screenshots of crypto wallets where everyone can see which coins you hold; the NFT profile pages that show which digital artifacts you own. Embedding an NFT you collected in your Mirror post, for example, is a way of signaling belonging and taste via content.\n\nBut there are very few ways of casually displaying digital belonging right now (particularly the kind of scarce ownership enabled by NFTs). I think this is an area with a lot of potential in the near future: less million-dollar NFTs, more $5 or subscription-based collectibles that you can show off, the way you'd carry a New Yorker tote. Mirror's crowdfunding demonstrates this, in a way, with the ability to own a form of equity in a particular project and participate beyond just consuming the content. \n\nSignaling belonging is its own form of value, beyond the value you might get from the content or product. The enforced scarcity of tokens has the possibility to enable more versions of belonging and displaying belonging than were possible before. Yet, like magazines, that sense of belonging has to be wrapped up with appealing content and branding — which are ways the community can publicize itself and express its ideas, just as Vogue does. That can come in the form of writing, compelling art, or just the aura of a new and exciting idea.
