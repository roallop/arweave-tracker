Some will be familiar as others have done similar things (no more politics on the company’s communication channels, no more committees, rethinking the review process).\n\nI think it is a good thing to revisit the ways a company does things and make changes when issues arise. And posting these changes publicly so that others can see them and think about them is very helpful. I had chats with a number of portfolio CEOs yesterday about this post. It is making people think. That’s a good thing.\n\nOne change that got my attention was this one:\n\n> **2. No more paternalistic benefits.** For years we’ve offered a fitness benefit, a wellness allowance, a farmer’s market share, and continuing education allowances. They felt good at the time, but we’ve had a change of heart. It’s none of our business what you do outside of work, and it’s not Basecamp’s place to encourage certain behaviors — regardless of good intention. By providing funds for certain things, we’re getting too deep into nudging people’s personal, individual choices. So we’ve ended these benefits, and, as compensation, paid every employee the full cash value of the benefits for this year. In addition, we recently introduced a 10% profit sharing plan to provide direct compensation that people can spend on whatever they’d like, privately, without company involvement or judgement.\n\nThat does not feel right to me. If you care about the mental and physical well-being of your team, I believe it makes sense to support them by investing in that. Companies can do that tax efficiently and employees cannot. Paying employees more so that they can then make these investments personally sounds rational but I don’t believe it will be as effective as company-funded programs that employees can opt into or not.\n\nIt is also the case that companies carry much of the cost of insuring their employees health in the US. While that may not be great health care policy, it is what it is right now. And so companies do have a vested interest in the health of their employees that goes beyond wanting them to be well and feel well.\n\nIt may be paternalistic, but I believe that companies can and should invest in the health and wellbeing of their team. I think it makes good business sense to do so.\n", "timestamp": 1619520478, "digest": "22TxknaIZhElhT7JYS-6YVX1bobARPwIj50JT27Y10k", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

It happened in 1747, when James Lind ran a controlled scientific study — maybe the first ever — and discovered that citrus fruits cured scurvy. \n\nIn Lind’s day, scurvy killed more British sailors than \"shipwreck, storms, all other diseases, **and enemy action combined**”. Which is to say that Lind's cure was not just going to save countless lives; it was an incomparably powerful *military technology*. The stakes couldn't have been higher. And yet, despite having been proven with the most advanced scientific methods the world had ever seen, **it was promptly lost** for many decades after. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/336e837a-bf15-493c-a3fd-c6703670af85.jpeg?height=512&width=1254)\n\nAccording to British Historian [C.C. Lloyd](https://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/hemila/history/Lloyd_1963.pdf), the British might have “lost the American War of Independence thirty years [after Lind’s study] because his cure was not adopted”. If Lloyd’s suggestion is correct, the discounted net assets of America is what gives you a roughly $1,000,000,000,000 bill that the British may have just left lying on the ground.\n\nWe will return to why and how this happened later. But for now let’s just observe that **the incentives for the production and dissemination of scientific truths are often really, really poor.** And so, as a result, humanity can lose even the most consequential truth. \n\n## Enter NFTs\n\nThe idea that NFTs could help rescue trillion dollar scientific truths from obscurity might strike you as a little fanciful. You might even be might be thinking... \"aren't NFTs just some hyped-up blockchain art thing? Why should they help science funding at all?\" So to start with let's take the simplest argument, and here we'll just quote it from our [2018 essay on NFTs for Science](https://glyphx.medium.com/post-venture-capital-and-the-crypto-nobel-prize-29847faf3f08):\n\n> Historically, great knowledge is valued like great art. Bill Gates paid $40 million for Leonardo Da Vinci’s Codex Leicester. Einstein’s manuscripts sell for millions. And a single page of Darwin’s writing fetches hundreds of thousands of dollars[...] People buy Darwin’s original pages because they are connected to his idea — the fact that information from The Origin of Species is freely available is not a bug for its high value; it’s a feature. Today’s Darwin would type The Origin of the Species in a Google Doc or a versioned LaTeX file... But now with Planck, and the digital scarcity blockchain enables, she would create a unique Glyph [NFT] that serves as that first manuscript copy.\n\nWe believe that this \"science as art\" argument is just the beginning, and so Planck has been testing ways in which funds and proceeds from NFTs can be channeled to improve science funding more broadly. The aim, ultimately, is to enable progress and to try to help save some of the consequential ideas we might otherwise lose.\n\nWithin this essay we are auctioning off an NFT as a small  test of the SplitStream, and incentive design for funding science through citations. To explain, let us first outline the project this NFT is a part of. Last month, after designing and crowdsourcing the first ever randomized control test of a long-untested theory, Planck sold the (publicly shared) result as [the first science NFT for $24,000](https://twitter.com/stephensonhmatt/status/1377316537950932992). These funds will help us run a replication of the study we ran. Here is something nice that a very smart person said about the project:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3a5983a6-915e-4fa7-997c-3a8a8c47a3db.jpeg?height=742&width=1178)\n\nBecause we are interested in incentives for consequential ideas that it seemed possible we might lose, we looked for a promising candidate for the test. The most promising candidate we found was the late Berkeley Professor Seth Roberts' appetite theory.\n\n## Testing Seth Roberts' Appetite Theory\n\nIn 2004, Berkeley Professor Seth Roberts discovered that consuming flavorless calories reduced his appetite. Consuming flavorless or unfamiliar calories made his eating habits more consciously controllable and helped him lose weight. And beyond weight loss, such a tool for conscious eating seemed to have the potential to help people eat more nutritious food, more easily go vegan, etc. Though preliminary, it was an enormous discovery.\n\nSeth was a serious empirical scientist and the [evidence he published for his theory was intriguing, if unorthodox](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866). But some very credible sources recognized the merit of his work and he was featured positively in the [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/magazine/does-the-truth-lie-within.html). His book became a bestseller. \n\nGlowing anecdotes appeared, including [a notable one from Reddit co-founder Aaron Swartz](https://5shz4jubhf5ju22lobejiotjv36et7td242q7nz6tx3puyuilcba.arweave.net/7I-eJoE5epprS3BIlDpprvxJ_mPXNQ-3Pp32-mKIWII). In that essay, Swartz confidently alludes to the \"clinical trials\" that would surely be carried out on Seth's Theory. **His essential optimism, his confidence that the world would obviously figure out a way to run a clinical test on something so promising, is striking**. \n\nBut the lab studies never came.\n\nWithin 5 years of its publication Seth’s idea had become little-discussed, never having undergone a single clinical trial. Some important outlets like [Marginal Revolution](https://zt3lipqi5yc4exoyclfunv7v2ws7hdmfmx6aeczs4hi2fzsgpaja.arweave.net/zPa0PgjuBcJd2BLLRtf11aXzjYVl_AILMuHRouZGeBI) [LessWrong](https://44zxnconwtyyk4ulw3bmvfq5fl5eeeyjft5yltiq3fdrsrt7kxqa.arweave.net/5zN2ic208YVyi7bCypYdKvpCEwks-4XNENlHGUZ_VeA), and [StatModeling](https://sbwt4p5ujwzqpk3543m24cn7wgrgrpmzvhcmg4u6fmpnkf55v2nq.arweave.net/kG0-P7RNswerfebZrgm_saJovZmpxMNynise1Re9rps) kept the flame alive, but the discussion of Seth's theory all but vanishes:\n\n![Google Searches for Seth Roberts' Theory over time](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/27863775-b21c-4641-a1c3-dd9a6ad63131.jpeg?height=664&width=2284)\n\nBy 2017, a few years after Seth had passed away, Neurobiologist Stephan Guyenet wrote that he expected to remain forever “puzzled” by Seth’s theory because “some sort of research” on it was “unlikely to ever happen.” Stephan’s answer reads more than a bit tragic; obesity kills [millions each year](https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/6-facts-on-obesity), interest in using conscious eating to help improve the world, as in vegetarianism, is skyrocketing. Failing to follow up on a promising theory in such a world feels a bit like an echo of our tragic failure to follow up on James Lind's scurvy cure. \n\n## Why Do We Lose Ideas?\n\n> \"Show me the incentive and I'll show you the result.\" - Charlie Munger\n\nJames Lind's scurvy cure [didn't mesh well with the science of 1747](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780312313920). Science was then 150 years away from discovering vitamins and so, naturally, it would have been hard to understand how it was the vitamin C in citrus that was the cure. The top minds of the day, viewing Lind's results, quickly came to believe that the acid in the juice must be melting some big black scurvy blob that sailors got in their stomachs. \"Great!\" they said, \"let's boil the juice to make it more acidic and work even better!\"\n\nUnfortunately, as we now understand, boiling the juice just destroys the Vitamin C content. Which means the boiled \"cure\" was no cure at all. Now there is nothing wrong about this; it's just good old normal science seeking understanding and trying out hypotheses. And 150 years later this did give us understanding, and that understanding was bigger than a simple cure for scurvy. The problem is that **somehow for the intervening 150 years everyone didn't just go back to using the limes that were proven to work**. \n\nIf Seth’s Theory proves out I think the story will be much the same as Lind's. Theories, like those of Seth Roberts and James Lind, which happen to integrate poorly with existing science of their day are bound to suffer. By failing to integrate into science they lose out on what is surely humanity's best protocol for rewarding, preserving, and developing openly shared knowledge. Patents might offer an alternative, but Seth's and Lind's theories were also hopelessly unpatentable. Citrus fruits are freely available and \"flavorless calories\" are easier to come by still; like a good scientist, Seth even set about demonstrating that a person could just [hold their nose](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/shangrila-diet-phenomenol_b_58958) as they ate and get the desired effect. Good luck writing that patent. \n\n## Demonstrating How NFTs can Help Fund Unpatentable Science\n\nWhen we first wrote about using NFTs as a unique way to fund science, Seth's was one of the major motivating cases. Here's how the simplest mechanism was intended to help fund such research:\n\n1. NFTs of high-potential scientific work are sold\n2. These NFTs, like a collectible, could grow in stature and value as the scientific work was validated\n3. Prospective NFT sales of early scientific results could thereby profitably fund the validation of that research\n\nAs mentioned earlier, our current project is bearing this out: Planck crowdsourced the first ever randomized control trial of Seth Roberts' appetite theory, sold an NFT of the result, and are now using the proceeds to run an independent lab replication of the findings. \n\nIt's important to keep in mind the bigger picture here though. We hope Seth's theory is true (who wouldn't?), but our fundamental concern regards the incentives themselves. To become a full-fledged scientific truth a theory needs to be exposed to falsification. So it's worth remembering that, while our preliminary results on Seth's Theory are promising, every step along the journey is important, as are the incentives to take those steps.\n\nIn this essay, we are introducing a novel incentive structure for scientific funding that uses citations as a channel for funding. We were calling this a \"CitationStream\" but piggybacking on [Jon-Kyle's terminology in his excellent essay](https://jk.mirror.xyz/3iLll7F39DjeVlJo4XNlfunl-C0xD3l2X8sjIJoB9vc), we are going to call it a “SplitStream”. The SplitStream is a system in which portions of an NFT sale may flow to some or all of the works the NFT cites, with those cited works then sending some of their funds further along to the works they cite, and so on. \n\n## The SplitStream\n\nYou might know the quote “If I have seen further, it is from standing on the shoulders of giants”. You might also know that it’s from Isaac Newton, a giant if there ever was one. So **in science, giants tend to look down and see other giants**. Citations, when they work, map those dependencies backwards through time. \n\nCitations on citations. \n\nGiants all the way down.\n\nIf you send funds through these citations, you get a cascade. A stream of splits. A SplitStream. \n\nHere’s what it looks like:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9dfd5cba-c828-461c-b0d5-2be765a465bb.jpeg?height=684&width=592)\n\nWe are running a test of this today as we help auction off an NFT of an independent data analysis of Seth’s Appetite Theory. The analysis was conducted by two esteemed professors of statistics, Harry Crane and Ryan Martin, and thus the NFT is theirs with proceeds directed according to them. \n\nAs a part of this independent analysis we were able to demo a powerful cryptographic technology from [Aleo](https://www.aleo.org/) which we believe will be very useful to further open science. We used a Zero-knowledge Proof in Leo to enable the statisticians to effectively \"query\" our dataset and see certain results without revealing the data itself. Because we are still learning how to use Leo (and because we will share the dataset publicly anyway!) we demonstrated this tech on a subset of results and outside the demo further tests were run.\n\nIndependent Analysis is a really valuable thing, and it is a [cutting edge Open Science best practice](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245917747646). \nThus we value Harry and Ryan's contributions greatly and have requested that they keep 50% of the NFT sale. They have also agreed to test the SplitStream and for the purposes of this incentive test, their analysis “cites” two NFTs:\n\nThe NFT of the Open Science Test of Seth’s Appetite Theory (currently owned by [Molecule](https://opensea.io/accounts/Molecule_to))\nThe NFT of this Essay Outlining the Protocol (owned by Planck) \n\nPlanck will then split our proceeds further to what we are citing:\n1. Mirror because we are using their amazing platform and tech. \n2. [This Artwork is Always on Sale](https://thisartworkisalwaysonsale.com/), suggested by Simon De La Rouvier as the proper target for the citation of his shared idea of Harberger taxes for NFT ownership (which is an important aspect of our protocol.)\n\nWe encourage the recipients of these proceeds, if they are at all substantial, to split back to those they would cite. Let's also note that this is a simple test of the mechanism and certainly does not represent the full range of actual citations we would use. Here is their NFT, an elegant violin plot of the results from the study we ran:\n\n[Token #2837](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=2837)\n\n## Design Challenges for the SplitStream\n\nAs a trained academic, I could hardly discuss a mechanism like the SplitStream without noting some potential pitfalls. Properly done, this has great potential to reward an effective division of labor in for open science and more. But it does not create obligations, or promises, or contracts, or anything like that. Participants are playing, roughly speaking, [a live trust game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PO3MTV0ZeA).\n\nAnd in fact, these incentives cannot become too enshrined and formal because citations are a fragile system. **A person’s inspiration is purely their private knowledge and thus it *must* be shared voluntarily.** A system which can't elicit honest attributions will fail.\n\nFor example, you could imagine that many people might appreciate being credited as the essential inspiration for a new Nobel-prize winning discovery in physics. Someone with sufficient resources, some prestige-hungry Jeff Bezos, might even be willing to pay for that honor. And then, of course, there’s nothing to stop our Nobel-winning physicist from claiming that her passing conversation with the dear leader Bezos was the fundamental inspiration for everything. Who could say otherwise? This sort of thing is absolutely going to happen sometimes, just as it sometimes happens in academia. \n\nI’m going to call these types of behaviors “Mao effects”: the seeking of favor from those with status or power by over-attributing to them. Mao of course was named the “great helmsman”, the “great leader”, etc. and anything good that happened was often attributed to him. **A network overtaken by these Mao effects breaks down, a Ponzi-scheme for those who claim complete originality.**\n\nIn an evolutionary simulation it roughly looks like this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3ba8b293-998f-4069-8c0c-d95e7ea9d006.jpeg?height=850&width=1100)\n\nThese effects can get more subtle as well. I can’t do much more here than sort of gesture at this and signal that I take these ideas seriously (e.g. [I actually coauthored a Behavioral Economics literature review called “When Do Monetary Incentives Backfire”](https://vr24zefnxcqg7hctadpx7dzmv3zq64oqodfcaiv2zwskewovtlna.arweave.net/rHXMkK24oG-cUwDff48srvMPcdBwyiAius2kolnVmto)). But a simple step toward preventing Mao Effects is observing the following two rules:\n\n1. Favor citing things which are publicly shared.\n2. Favor citing things which also cite. \n\nThe first condition helps provide a level of transparency and sense-making to the system. So, for instance, you can understand why I cite Mirror because you can clearly see that I'm using their tech. The second condition helps ensure that cited works offer further attribution to the work they've built on. Together these rules help ensure that a would-be Mao openly shares their knowledge while also citing that which contributed to it.\n\n## The Big Picture: Seeking the \"civil society patch\" for Internet Technology\n\nIn the preceding sections, we’ve discussed the ways in which Web3 might enable the sharing and preservation of ideas. It only seems fitting to close this discussion with a small, highly speculative idea of our own.\n\nThe First Industrial Revolution (“IR 1”) is the famous one, occurring a little before the year 1800. It connected people with railroads and steamships and yet, despite its fame, it brought almost no growth:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4b4f3c30-d00a-45f7-96fa-8d3429446746.jpeg?height=335&width=600)\n\nInstead, it took many decades until anyone saw the “big bang” wave of growth that we learned about in grade school, the one that ushered in the modern world. \n\n**This big bang growth actually appeared alongside a second wave of major inventions, quite distinct from the inventions of IR 1.** Whereas IR 1 brought us together with connecting inventions like the steam engine, the second wave had the great livability innovations in areas like heating, sanitation, electric lights, elevators, motion pictures, etc.\n\nThe IR 1 world was a newly connected one, but it was also polluted and dangerous and kind of miserable. And we didn’t actually produce much growth all huddled together, drinking dirty water and breathing fumes. But then, once we figured out how to make this newly connected world more livable and pleasant, things got vastly better. Only then did we get the growth explosion that the Industrial Revolution is famous for.\n\nIn this light then, rather than seeing the second wave of inventions as an IR 2, we might see them as the civil society patch: IR 1.1. Before the patch it just wasn't that pleasant to all live together but after the patch, suddenly, it wasn't so bad. \n\nWhat if the same thing is true now? You can read [top economists today pondering over the stagnant growth and missing productivity of the internet era](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691147727/the-rise-and-fall-of-american-growth) dating back to the 1970s. But so too might an economist during IR 1.0 have puzzled over the missing productivity that the steam engine should have wrought. What if today’s economists are wrong for the same reasons — what if the internet is indeed revolutionary and we just haven't gotten the 2.1 patch?\n\nThe internet brought our minds together in a great network to rival the 19th century network of railways and steamships. If this 1800s network could take you to undeniably thrilling — but also crowded and disgusting — cities, perhaps the internet too feels a bit like this now. It's thrilling but awful, alluring but somehow inhumane. And so some optimism is available in the story of the 19th century, and the fact that *its* network showed a lot of promise but failed to deliver for a very long time until, suddenly, it did.\n\nLet’s dare to hope that an even greater change awaits us once we figure out how to live and think together online. Structuring, rewarding, and preserving promising ideas seems like a step in the right direction. \n", "timestamp": 1619542572, "digest": "vKZToDiv68BGnKx6HjUqYHKnJOI5IpU95dbrETU5Seg", "contributor": "0x5BA02f4Ff6Af1d9d2Af8774D10fD32Eb57d4E2E6", "nft": "{\"nftTransactionHash\": \"0xa7d518b7a12a005c4941a88709349ace127f2e37efa3467a7ddef9b7ffa6a852\"}"}
