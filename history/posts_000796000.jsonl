的跨链桥使用教程**\n\n**1.准备MetaMask**钱包\n\nhttps://metamask.io/download.html\n\n安装MetaMask\n\n注：有私钥的可以选择导入私钥创建钱包，没有私钥的可以选择创建钱包，记得备份好助记词与私钥，如果忘了也可以进入钱包后导出私钥。\n\n**2.配置Arbitrum One主网参数**\n\n（1）可以访问http://bridge.arbitrum.io/，点击页面中间的\"添加/切换到Arbitrum网络\"，将自动添加网络。\n\n（2）手动添加方式：\n\n选择自定义RPC，进入参数配置页面，按步骤依次填写，如下所示：\n\n网络名称：Arbitrum One（也可自定义）\n\n新增RPC URL：\n\nhttps://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc\n\n链ID：42161\n\n代码：ETH\n\n区块浏览URL：\n\nhttps://explorer.arbitrum.io\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211022/9b41bec653754c979624863df9171057_GIYTOKRTGAYQ.png)\n\n参数配置好后，点击下方保存，即成功创建Arbitrum One钱包，如果想要继续增加钱包，可以通过导入以太坊钱包私钥来创建，也可以直接点击创建账户，创建完成后记得保存私钥即可\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211022/b48c3e22ea914493b7ce8f078a4e4dcf_GIYTMKRSHEZQ.png)\n\n**3.Arbitrum跨链桥使用教程**\n\nArbitrum跨链桥使用起来很简单，**不过只能从以太网络**L1转到L2的Arbitrum网络，只能转ERC20的资产\\*\\*\\*\\*。\n\n跨链之前也需要准备一些GAS费的代币，比如要从以太网络L1跨链资产去Arbitrum主网，首先需要保证以太网络的钱包中有ETH，其次资产跨到Arbitrum主网后，也需要保证Arbitrum主网钱包中有ETH才能正常使用，**所以如果需要跨过去的资产不是很多，直接多跨一些**ETH过去**即可**，然后用**ETH去换购其他资产**。\n\n**Arbitrum网址：**\n\n**https://bridge.arbitrum.io/**\n\n**3-1 链接钱包**\n\n在开始之前，请准备一个MetaMask钱包，输入网址，点击【Connect Wallet】链接钱包，连接MetaMask钱包，再确认连接即可。\n\n**3-2使用跨链桥**\n\n钱包链接好以后，就可以使用了，可以看到左侧是L1的资产，右边是L2资产。比如：我们从以太网络跨链2.4个ETH到L2 Arbitrum网络。可以看到钱包资产有2.411个ETH，因为跨链也需要消耗ETH的GAS费，所以预留一些GAS费。\n\n在数量处输入2.4，点击【desposit】会出来一个提示的弹窗，点击【PROCEED】继续进行，在MetaMask钱包弹出窗口中点击【Confirm】确认。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211022/376542201f1043879024169d7d8b984a_GU3TCKRTGA3A.png)\n\n**3-3查到账资产**\n\n确认之后等几分钟就可以了，下方是跨链记录，等右边L2资产出显示出资产就是到账了，然后去MetaMask钱包切换Arbitrum网络查看资产即可。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211022/231d321d001e4cc8a11c7f3c7e6df8ba_GU3TMKRTGQ2A.png)\n\n**3-4跨链其他ERC20资产**\n\n如果需要跨链其他资产去Arbitrum网络的话，点击ERC-20，点击ADD Token，输入ERC20 Token的合约地址，比如USDT的，然后键盘按下【回车键】确认\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211022/4a9ba16178454aa1846ee0cef212dd93_GU2TQKRSGU3Q.png)\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211022/4c5dc713b2a8421db0cc7c98ebd34ed0_GU2TOKRSGUYQ.png)\n\n添加成功后可以看到USDT资产，然后授权Approve，输入数量，点击【desposit】等即可，和跨链ETH操作一样。\n\n**3-5L2跨到L1**\n\n如果需要将L2 Arbitrum网络的资产跨链到L1以太坊网络，在MetaMask钱包选择Arbitrum网络。打开Arbitrum跨链桥地址，可以看到L2账户的资产数量，输入数量，点击【withdraw】按提示操作即可。**但是**Arbitrum资产转到L1以太网络，需要等到45818个区块，也就是好几天，着急到账的可以考虑其他跨链桥产品\\*\\*\\*\\*。\n\n### **智能合约风险**\n\n任何智能合约中都有可能存在漏洞，导致用户资金的损失。\n\n### **价格风险**\n\n一旦以太币或代币从L1→L2或L2→L1被桥接，资金价值可能会因为市场波动而发生变化。\n\n**Celer Network(cBRIDGE)的跨链桥使用教程**\n\n**使用**cBridge完成跨链的具体操作如下：\\*\\*\\*\\*（以从Arbitrum跨链至BSC为例）\n\n进入网站：\n\nhttps://cbridge.celer.network/#/transfer\n\n点击“Connect Wallet”并在钱包中确认连接。\n\n连接成功后，右上角即会显示目前的主网和钱包地址。\n\n如图，本文以从Arbitrum向BSC转移USDC为例。如果希望更换公链或币种，在红框处选择即可。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211022/e9863ee8b43744cf9f3680047cd55397_GM4TQKRRHE2Q.png)\n\n在红框处输入希望转出的金额，如果有一个活跃的中继节点有足够的流动性可以满足这笔交易，即可看到在目的地链上收到的金额和这次转账的手续费\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211022/16dd16c689c14cacaf85328992274919_GM4TOKRUGU4Q.png)\n\n点击“transfer”、点击“APPROVE”，然后在钱包中确认以允许合约调用钱包中的USDC Token。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211022/62fba3980bdd4867988064ed1c4649cb_GQYDAKRUHA4Q.png)\n\n批准成功后，点击“Submit Transfer”并在钱包中确认进行跨链。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211022/83a504b8ee7345a19de80bd9e8cecbdd_GM4TIKRUGYYA.png)\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211022/9007a5e21e4f4c899430fd603bb2a605_GQYDGKRWGY2A.png)\n\n当交易被中继节点确认后，点击弹出窗口中的“Release Fund”即可提取这笔资金。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211022/800a279edc6441e2b29d320658641c58_GM4TSKRUHAYA.png)\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211022/be56dfd4de97434eb59fd8b1b4c34066_GM4TGKRWGI2A.png)\n\n资金提取成功后，弹出窗口即会显示如下内容，切换至BSC主网即可查看资金是否到账。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211022/9875dd2f46664ce2b27405b4053f5415_GM4TSKRUHEYQ.png)\n\n**HopProtocol跨链桥交互指南**\n\n**官方项目地址：https://hop.exchange**\n\nHop是一款针对\\\\\n\nMainnet/polygon/Arbitrum/Optimism/Xdai的跨链工具。截止9月30日，通过Hop跨链的资产超过1亿美金。\n\nHop的跨链是分别在不同链上生成h资产，并组成流动性池，满足用户的跨链需求，一定程度下会出现某条链上的某个资产被提空，导致无法跨链的情况。\n\n交互准备\n\nHop目前支持的4种跨链资产分别是USDC/USDT/DAI/MATIC，这里我用的是三种稳定币进行跨链。钱包里必须有相应的ETH支付gas。\n\n**1.稳定币跨链交互**\n\n链接好钱包以后，在【send】页面选择需要跨链的币种以及需要把资产转移到哪条链即可，首次操作需要进行一次授权。由于目标是刷空投交互，建议选择polygon/optimism/arbitrum三条链互转，gas成本比较低。跨链会收取手续费，L2的gas费很低。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211022/05a4e414c54f49a393ccd107325c385d_GIZTMKRSHE2Q.png)\n\n提交的跨链交易可以通过点击右上角查看具体进度，全程只需一次确认即可完成跨链，整个过程还是非常顺畅的（不包括首次的授权）\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211022/b84fdfc420e449689564d097d3a20577_GUZTGKRSG43Q.png)\n\n**2.LP交互**\n\n除了跨链转账交互，Hop还可以通过提供LP的方式交互，LP交互需要两步完成，这个过程和日常玩defi的过程类似\n\n**3.\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*获得**h资产\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nh资产需要在convert页面获取，AMM或者hop

Hyphen跨链桥交互指南**\n\nBiconomy 在 7 月底从 Mechanism Capital、DACM 以及 Coinbase Ventures 等筹集到 900 万美元后，在本月又面向开发者上线跨链转账基础设施 Hyphen，还将在今年后半年推出原生代币 BICO，以实现社区治理并激励利益相关者。\n\n随着 StarkEx3.0 主网上线使 L2 用户轻松与 L1 交互、Arbitrum 计划本月底推出主网公测版、L2 扩容方案 Hermez Network 被 Polygon 收购将发展成为后者基于 ZK-Rollups 的以太坊 L2 扩展解决方案等一系列进展的落地，以太坊网络的 L2 扩容以及让 L2 与 L1 获得更好交互体验的愿景正在迅速「由虚转实」，而区块链开发工具提供商 Biconomy 推出的跨链转账基础设施 Hyphen 主网也已正式上线，目前支持以太坊主网和 Polygon 之间的跨链操作。\n\n目前主流的解决方案下，用户从 L2 撤回资金到 L1 以及像从 Optimistic Ethereum 提款到以太坊等操作往往需要数十分钟乃至几天的时间才能完成。而 Biconomy 新推出的 Hyphen 即意图解决这一痛点，优化用户将资金从 L2 撤至 L1 以及 EVM 链、各种 L2 间的跨链资金转移低效的现状。\n\n**Hyphen 如何实现跨链转移？**\n\n简单来说，Hyphen 为开发者提供了一套简单的 API， 允许提供跨链转移操作，目前暂时仅支持 Polygon 和以太坊网络之间 USDC 和 USDT 代币的转移。实现方式就是，Hyphen 会在两条链上维持代币流动性，在一条链上接收到用户的代币后，再在另外一条链上转移代币，若单向输出过多，还会自动平衡流动性。\n\n由于需要维持流动性的缘故，也因此，用户在跨链转移时需要支付费用给流动性提供者。从 Hyphen 跨链实现方式可以看出，用户在将资金从一条链转移至目标链时需要支付的跨链转移费用包括流动性提供者费用（转移资金的 0.1%）以及用户支付给 Biconomy 用来从目标链上收到资金的交易费用（与目标链 Gas 费用相关）。经测试，若要通过 Biconomy 将 USDC 从从以太坊转至 Polygon 需要经过以下三个阶段，分别为在以太坊上同意 USDC 支付、存款给 Biconomy 部署在以太坊上的流动性智能合约以及在 Polygon 收到转账，共需要支付四部分费用，其中前两个阶段（属于跨链转账之前的准备工作）中用户需在以太坊上支付两次 Gas 费。之后在存款完成后进行跨链操作，需要支付流动性提供者费用和目标链上的交易费用，测试发现单纯跨链转账所需要的时间来看，大概在 10 秒之内可以完成。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211022/6241ced8827744d4ad8b13db36d239c5_GIZTKKRSGU3A.png)\n\n同理，从 Polygon 转至以太坊也需要在 Polygon 上同意支付 USDC 后在 Polygon 上存款要转移的资金，然后再从以太坊上接收。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211022/e8e37d9367fb4e2e965712affd30b760_GI2TOKRSHE4A.png)\n\n从智能合约层面上，Biconomy 已在所有支持的链上部署了 LiquidityPoolManger 合约，所有流动性都将存储在这些链上。另外，Biconomy 中的链下服务器，也就是执行器节点（Executor Node），会不断监控智能合约的任何存款交易。\\\\\n\n而执行器节点有两个主要组件，分别为 Watch Tower 和 Executors，Watch Tower 会监控 LiquidityPoolManager 智能合约，在发现存款交易后就会通知 Executor 组件。Executor 接收到信号后，会验证存款交易并在另外一条链上发起转账交易，完成跨链操作。\n\n**Connext--NXTPL2层跨链指南**\n\n## **Rollup Bridge：Connext NXTP**\n\nNXTP（Noncustodial Xchain Transfer

QCAMM 协议介绍\n    2\\.1QCAMM 协议概述\n    QCAMM （Quoted Price and Constant Sum Based Automated Market\n    Maker ）是基于外部报价和基于恒定和公式的动态费率的金融衍生品交易协议。\n    QCAMM 协议通过多个外部预言机、去中心化交易所，如 Chainlink、uniswap、\n    OpenOracle、Mdex、PancakeSwap 等，获得交易品类的当前综合报价，交易者按该\n    报价直接完成做多或做空的成交，不存在滑点，交易深度与 LP 的抵押额成正比。LP 只提供\n    单一币种抵押，不存在无常损失。\n    QCAMM 协议的主要特点包括：\n     外部喂价：交易价格并不是像 AMM 一样，由算法决定，而是从多个外部去中心化数\n    据源取到，包括预言机和去中心化交易所；\n     0 滑点：交易者在平台允许开仓金额范围内，以当前报价直接成交，不存在价格滑点；\n     交易深度深：交易者交易深度只取决于 LP 抵押金额，如果目前平台抵押 1000 万美金，\n    交易者可以用当前价格直接成交 1000 万美金的多单或空单；\n     没有无常损失：AMM 需要抵押交易对中的两种货币，比如 eth/usdt 交易对，需要 LP\n    同时抵押 eth 和 usdt，而 QCAMM 中，LP 只需要抵押单一的结算货币即可，在 dFuture\n    中，该结算货币为 USDT。因为仅抵押单一币种，所以 QCAMM 中不存在无常损失。\n    2\\.2QCAMM 协议风险控制原理\n    QCAMM 协议的一个重要目标是控制 LP 在平台暴露的风险头寸，从而实现 LP 在平台\n    的无风险获利。QCAMM 协议通过“动态手续费/动态持仓费”的机制，引入套利者角色在\n    平台主动交易，从而形成平台的动态平衡，将平台风险控制在较低水平波动。具体原理如下：\n     对交易平台而言，如果平台的多头持仓量和空头持仓量的数值相等，即多头头寸与空头\n    头寸抵消，裸头寸为 0，此时 LP 将不存在任何风险，可以持续获得交易者的交易手续\n    费和持仓利息，实现无风险获利；所以控制 LP 风险问题就转化为如何让裸头寸为 0；\n     QCAMM 协议通过“基于恒定和公式的动态手续费/动态持仓费”机制来控制裸头寸为\n    0，以动态手续费举例，恒定和公式是指“多单手续费+空单手续费=恒定值”。在裸头\n    寸较小时，平台向多头和空头同时收取交易手续费，其费率低于中心化交易所；在裸头\n    寸较大时，比如裸头寸方向为多头，此时开多单时需要缴纳更高的手续费，而开空单时，\n    平台将向交易者返还手续费；\n     通过返还手续费，平台存在套利空间，将吸引套利者进入交易。在出现返还手续费的状\n    态时，如裸头寸方向为多头，套利者可以通过在本平台下空单，在 Cefi 交易所如火币\n    下多单，抵消头寸风险，同时获得本平台的手续费返还，从而实现无风险套利；同时由\n    于套利者的交易，本平台的裸头寸将向 0 值回归，LP 风险敞口随之降低；\n    总之，QCAMM 协议的风险控制将长期处于一个动态平衡的过程中，从长期来看，LP\n    的风险敞口将一直维持在一个较低的水平线左右，从而实现 LP 的长期无风险获利。\n    2\\.3QCAMM 协议、AMM 协议和 Cefi 交易所的差异\n    由于设计思路上的较大差异，QCAMM 与 AMM 和 Cefi 交易所在功能特点方面存在\n    一定区别：\n    中心化交易所 AMM（uniswap） QCAMM（dFuture）\n    价格 订单薄价格 恒定积价格 外部报价\n    滑点 根据深度形成的滑点 根据恒定积，不可避免的\n    滑点\n    无滑点\n    交易深度 大于 AMM 深度差 大于中心化交易所的深度，\n    与 LP 抵押金额成线性相关\n    无常损失 没有 有 没有\n    交易手续费 高且不透明 低 动态调整\n    平台风险低时低于前两种交\n    易所；\n    交易模式 限价单/市价单\n    挂单/吃单\n    市价单\n    吃单\n    市价单\n    吃单\n    透明度 不透明 透明 透明\n    LP 池 无 有 有\n    LP 抵押币种 无 交易对双币种抵押 单一币种抵押\n    2\\.4基于 QCAMM 协议的永续合约与传统永续合约的差异\n    QCAMM 永续合约大部分特点与传统永续合约很类似，基于去中心化的特点，主要有\n    以下几点需要注意：\n    交易模式：在传统的永续合约交易中，主要存在限价单和市价单两种交易单类型，同时\n    交易者会有吃单（taker）和挂单（maker）两种交易状态。在 QCAMM 永续合约中，只\n    有市价单一种交易类型，该市价单没有滑点，深度最大为 LP 池金额的 3 倍；同时交易者无\n    论是开仓还是平仓，都只有吃单一种状态；\n    平台价格：平台价格是从多个外部去中心化数据源取到的价格，做为成交的基准价格存\n    在，并用于计算浮盈浮亏；\n    初始和维持保证金：交易者应非常熟悉初始和维持保证金，特别是维持保证金。用户的\n    保证金一旦低于维持保证金，系统将会强制平仓。强烈建议交易者在维持保证金比率以上就\n    进行平仓，以避免因强制平仓而产生的资金损失；\n    动态手续费：为了降低裸头寸给平台带来的交易风险，我们通过“恒定和”公式，保证\n    开多和开空的手续费之和总是一个固定值。在该公式的限定下，在平台开仓的手续费的费率\n    大小会随着裸头寸的大小变化，同时手续费可能为正也可能为负，为正时交易者付给平台交\n    易手续费，为负时平台将付给交易者交易手续费，该部分恒定收益由 LP 获得；\n    动态持仓利息：为了降低裸头寸给平台带来的交易风险，我们通过“恒定和”公式，保\n    证持多仓和持空仓的持仓利息之和总是一个固定值。在该公式的限定下，在平台持仓的持仓\n    利息的费率大小会随着裸头寸的大小变化，同时持仓利息可能为正也可能为负，为正时交易\n    者付给平台利息，为负时平台将付给交易者利息，该部分恒定收益由 LP 获得；\n    杠杆：与现货市场不同，合约市场允许交易者进行超过其本金的交易，即存在杠杆。随\n    着我们对 QCAMM 交易模式的深入理解，杠杆的倍率也会增加；\n    LP 池：平台按风险高低划分了多个 LP 池，在高风险池中，交易者可以使用高杠杆交易\n    多种数字货币合约，这些数字货币合约可能由低风险波动的交易对和高风险波动的交易对共\n    同组成，交易者可能获得高收益，LP 也有可能获得更高的收益；在低风险池中，交易者可\n    以使用低杠杆交易多种数字货币合约，这些数字货币合约将由低风险波动的主流币种交易对\n    组成，交易者和 LP 都将获得更稳定的收益；对 LP 来说，其只需要按自己的风险偏好，选\n    择不同的 LP 池，完成 USDT 的流动性抵押，就可以获取收益；\n    透明交易：QCAMM 永续合约价格只取决于外部喂价，并通过特定算法避免外部喂价\n    被攻击，平台公平、透明、可信；\n    透明收费：QCAMM 永续合约的所有收费规则已经固化在智能合约中，对用户完全清\n    晰可见。\n    2\\.5基于 QCAMM 协议永续合约的进一步扩展\n    dFuture V1 版本中，通过外部报价接入了数字货币主流币的期货交易，对 QCAMM\n    协议来说，只要能通过去中心化方式取得外部报价，就可以在 QCAMM 协议下进行交易。\n    所以类似股票、外汇等众多交易品种在未来都可以在 dFuture 上形成交易，进一步扩展\n    dFuture 的交易品类和面向的交易者人群。\n 3. QCAMM 协议交易体系介绍\n    LP 针对抵押池提供流动性抵押后，交易者就可以对该抵押池中的多个交易对进行交易\n    了。dFuture 目前提供的是带杠杆的永续合约交易。交易者以当前实时的平台价格，进行买\n    多或者卖空的交易。交易者可以自由的设定本次交易的杠杆，初始范围为 1 到 30 倍之间。\n    交易确认后，交易者的保证金将被扣除。伴随着以太坊的每次出块，dFuture 会实时检查交\n    易者的当前仓位情况，如果持仓保证金率低于当前币种最低档位维持保证金率，交易者将爆\n    仓。dFuture 平台会对即将爆仓的交易者进行提醒，交易者可以对自己即将爆仓的交易追加\n    保证金，从而避免爆仓风险。\n    3\\.1报价体系\n    交易价格来自综合多个预言机、去中心化交易所的自动报价。为了避免单一交易所的价\n    格被攻击，导致 dFuture 的交易者受损，我们采用多个预言机和去中心化交易所做为数据\n    源，并对其报价进行加权平均，公式为：X1*X2+Y1*Y2+…=价格，其中 X1，Y1 为不同来\n    源的去中心化交易所或预言机的价格，X2，Y2…为加权数，X2+Y2+… = 1。我们目前选用\n    chainlink、uniswap、OpenOracle、Mdex、PancakeSwap 等做为外部报价来源，加\n    权后合成价格，即 dfuture 平台的“平台价格”。\n    我们同时还采取一些额外的保护措施，来避免由于现货市场价格出现中断或由于连接问\n    题而导致糟糕的市场表现。这些保护措施如下：\n 4. 单一价格来源偏离：当某个交易所的最新价格偏离所有价格来源的中位数价格超过\n    5％时，该交易所的价格权重将被设置为零。\n 5. 多价格来源偏差：如果超过 1 个交易所的最新价格出现大于 5％的偏差，则所有价\n    格来源的中位数价格将会取代其加权平均值，用作价格指数值。\n 6. 交易所连接问题：如果一个交易所在 2 个以太坊出块内没有更新交易数据，则在计\n    算加权平均值时，该交易所的权重将为零。\n    当出现价格异常的时候平台会暂时关闭交易，直至问题被解决后恢复交易。平台价格可\n    以被视为公允的现货价格，我们以此来计算各合约的未实现盈亏。请注意，账户实际盈亏以\n    平仓时成交的市场价格为准。后续通过社区治理，可以添加更多的成熟的去中心化交易所和\n    预言机进入 dFuture 的报价体系。\n    3\\.2成交价格\n    成交价格为平台价格收取点差后的价格。该点差的收取目的，一方面是避免频繁的开平\n    仓的刷量攻击，另一方面，收取的点差收入将进入到风险保障基金，为交易者和 LP 提供一\n    定的交易保护。\n    平台价格我们记为 P，点差记为 M。多单成交价格为 P1 = P\\*（1+M），空单成交价格\n    P2 = P \\* (1-M); dFuture 平台初始化时，M 设定为 0.05%，同时开仓时没有点差，平仓时会\n    产生点差。M 值后续可以通过社区治理进行调整。\n    3\\.3动态交易手续费\n    交易者在 dFuture 平台上进行交易时，都需要缴纳交易手续费。与传统的交易平台不\n    同，为了控制平台交易风险，交易手续费根据平台目前裸头寸与 LP 池的比例将动态变化。\n    目前平台设定裸头寸与 LP 池比值最大为 1：1，所以裸头寸与 LP 池的比值在\\[-1,1\\]值域区间，\n    其中负值代表裸头寸为空单方向；正值代表裸头寸为多单方向；随着裸头寸与 LP 池的比值\n    在-1 到+1 之间滑动，多单手续费和空单手续费也会一起变动，不变的是多单手续费+空单\n    手续费恒定为恒定值。具体手续费的计算公式如下：\n    D=（多单总头寸-空单总头寸）/ LP 池总金额\n    多单手续费 X1 = N1 + M1 \\* D；\n    空单手续费 Y1 = N1 – M1 \\* D；\n    多单手续费 X1 + 空单手续费 Y1 = 2*N1（恒定值）；\n    M1 \\* D = 手续费偏移量；\n    其中 M1=1% ；N1=LP 手续费优势，这里以 0.03%为例；\n    手续费随 D 值变动列表：\n    多单总\n    头寸\n    空单总头\n    寸\n    LP 池总金\n    额\n    裸头寸/LP 池总\n    额 多单手续费\n    空单手续\n    费 恒定和\n    0 0 100 0 0.03% 0.03% 0.06%\n    0 1 100 -0.01 0.02% 0.04% 0.06%\n    0 3 100 -0.03 0.00% 0.06% 0.06%\n    0 5 100 -0.05 -0.02% 0.08% 0.06%\n    0 10 100 -0.1 -0.07% 0.13% 0.06%\n    0 50 100 -0.5 -0.47% 0.53% 0.06%\n    0 100 100 -1 -0.97% 1.03% 0.06%\n    1 0 100 0.01 0.04% 0.02% 0.06%\n    3 0 100 0.03 0.06% 0.00% 0.06%\n    5 0 100 0.05 0.08% -0.02% 0.06%\n    10 0 100 0.1 0.13% -0.07% 0.06%\n    50 0 100 0.5 0.53% -0.47% 0.06%\n    100 0 100 1 1.03% -0.97% 0.06%\n    交易费随 D 值变动如下图：\n    手续费与 D 值变动关系\n    同时，考虑到买卖单，特别是大额买卖单对 D 值的冲击影响，我们会通过对买入前和\n    买入后的 D 值进行加权平均处理，平滑买卖单的冲击，具体计算公式：\n    D=（多单总头寸-空单总头寸）/ LP 池总金额\n    多单手续费 = 0.03% + 1%*（用户下多单前的 D + 用户下多单后的 D）/ 2\n    空单手续费 = 0.03% - 1%*（用户下空单前的 D + 用户下空单后的 D）/ 2\n    例：目前多单总头寸 110 万 USDT，空单总头寸 10 万 USDT，LP 池总金额 1000 万 USDT。\n    情况 1：交易者开 10 万 USDT 多单\n    用户下多单前的 D = （110 – 10 ） / 1000 = 0.1\n    用户下多单后的 D = （120 – 10 ）/ 1000 = 0.11\n    多单手续费 = （0.03% + 1% \\* （0.1 + 0.11）/ 2）* 100,000 = 0.135% \\* 100,000 = 135\n    此时平台收取交易者 135U 手续费；\n    情况 2：交易者开 10 万 USDT 空单\n    用户下空单前的 D = （110 – 10 ） / 1000 = 0.1\n    用户下空单后的 D = （110 – 20 ）/ 1000 = 0.09\n    空单手续费 = (0.03% - 1% \\* （0.1 + 0.09）/ 2)*100,000 = -0.065% \\* 100,000 = -65\n    此时平台会返还交易者 65U 手续费。\n    总结以上数据，可以明显发现，在裸头寸（多单总头寸-空单总头寸）占 LP 池总金额\n    0% - 3%时，平台向交易双方收取交易手续费，同时会向裸头寸倾斜的方向收取稍多一些的\n    手续费；在裸头寸占 LP 池总金额超过 3%时，裸头寸正方向的新开仓需要缴纳手续费，裸\n    头寸反方向的新开仓将获得手续费的返还。\n    所以，系统永远鼓励交易向降低裸头寸的方向倾斜，交易者可以通过反裸头寸方向交易\n    的方法额外获利。\n    3\\.4动态持仓利息\n    交易者在 dFuture 平台进行交易时，如果有持仓，需要支付持仓利息，其目的是控制\n    平台交易风险。与传统的交易平台不同，持仓利息根据平台目前裸头寸与 LP 池的比例将动\n    态变化。目前平台设定裸头寸与 LP 池比值最大为 1：1，所以裸头寸与 LP 池的比值在\\[-1,1\\]\n    值域区间，其中负值代表裸头寸为空单方向；正值代表裸头寸为多单方向；随着裸头寸与\n    LP 池的比值在-1 到+1 之间滑动，多单持仓利息和空单持仓利息也会一起变动，不变的是多\n    单持仓利息+空单持仓利息恒定为恒定值。具体持仓利息的计算公式如下：\n    D=（多单总头寸-空单总头寸）/ LP 池总金额\n    多单持仓利息 X2 = N2 + M2 \\* D + L；\n    空单持仓利息 Y2 = N2 – M2 \\* D - L；\n    多单持仓利息 X2 + 空单持仓利息 Y2 = 2*N2（恒定值）；\n    M2 \\* D = 利息偏移量；\n    其中 M2=0.05% ；N2（利息优势）=0%；L = 0；\n    L 为当期基准费率，其含义为中心化交易所永续合约当前资金费率的加权平均值，目前\n    设置为 0，后期将通过去中心化预言机取该价格；\n    持仓利息随 D 值变化的变动值：\n    多单总头\n    寸\n    空单总头\n    寸\n    LP 池总金\n    额\n    裸头寸/LP\n    池总额 多单持仓利息 空单持仓利息 恒定和\n    0 0 100 0 0.0000% 0.0000% 0%\n    0 1 100 -0.01 -0.0005% 0.0005% 0%\n    0 10 100 -0.1 -0.005% 0.005% 0%\n    0 50 100 -0.5 -0.0250% 0.0250% 0%\n    0 100 100 -1 -0.0500% 0.0500% 0%\n    1 0 100 0.01 0.0005% -0.0005% 0%\n    10 0 100 0.1 0.005% -0.005% 0%\n    50 0 100 0.5 0.025% -0.025% 0%\n    100 0 100 1 0.050% -0.050% 0%\n    具体如下图所示：\n    持仓利息每 8 小时结算一次，扣除的利息会直接生效，返还的利息在用户平仓时一次性\n    结算。可以看到，在裸头寸（多单总头寸-空单总头寸）占 LP 池总金额 0% - 10%时，平台\n    向多空持仓双方收取持仓利息，同时会向裸头寸倾斜的方向收取稍多一些的利息费；在裸头\n    寸占 LP 池总金额超过 10%时，裸头寸方向的持仓需要缴纳利息，裸头寸反方向的持仓将获\n    得利息的返还。\n    所以，系统永远鼓励持仓向降低裸头寸的方向倾斜，交易者可以通过反裸头寸方向持仓\n    的方法额外获利。\n    3\\.5竞争性平仓\n    dFuture 会实时检查交易者的当前仓位情况，如果持仓保证金率低于当前币种最低档位\n    维持保证金率，交易者将爆仓。在交易者爆仓时，交易者账户存在如下两种情况，1.价格波\n    动不极端，交易者仓位还余留资金；2.价格波动太剧烈，交易者仓位没有资金剩余，发生了\n    穿仓。\n    dFuture 提供了竞争性平仓机制，让参与平台交易的“数据科学家”来帮助平台完成平\n    仓的动作。竞争性平仓是指，在出现交易者被强平时，“数据科学家”可以主动针对提示被\n    强平的账户发送平仓交易请求，在未穿仓时，平仓交易成功的“数据科学家”可以获得该仓\n    位剩余资金 Y，0 <Y<MIN（X，Y）其中 X 为平台设定的“数据科学家”单次平仓交易成功\n    后可获得的资金最高固定值，该值后期通过社群治理做出修改，该账户剩余资金扣除 Y 后\n    将打入 LP 平仓收益池。\n    “数据科学家”付出以太坊平台交易手续费既可以得到大约 5 倍的回报，其风险是如果\n    该单已经穿仓，则没有回报；或者如果有多个“数据科学家”竞争平仓同一个仓位，只有一\n    位“数据科学家”可以获得奖励，其他人将损失其手续费。\n    3\\.6风险保障基金及自动减仓\n    风险保障基金旨在弥补由于客户账户资产低于 0 时而导致的损失，风险保障基金目前由\n    两部分组成：一、被强平用户支付的保证金费用将被注入风险保障基金；二、每笔平仓交易，\n    其成交价格会浮动 0.01%，该部分金额被注入风险保障基金。风险保障基金的主要目的是减\n    少交易方穿仓风险发生后对 LP 造成的损失。\n    若用户发生穿仓的情况，即在用户被强制平仓后，账户上没有剩余资金或无法强平时，\n    LP 会接管用户账户上剩余的仓位。dFututre 平台会使用风险保障基金来进行反向平仓，当\n    风险保障基金不够接管被强平用户的剩余持仓，此时 LP 将发生亏损。LP 池发生亏损时，由\n    于系统最大开仓量为 LP 池金额的 3 倍，如果此时开仓量已达到限额，将会发生自动减仓的\n    情况，系统会根据预设算法进行减仓。\n    3\\.7LP 抵押池的多交易对支持\n    dFuture 平台中，同一个 LP 抵押池中，只要保持交易对的底对一致，可以存在多个交\n    易对，比如 ETH/USDT 交易对、BTC/USDT 交易对等。LP 抵押池按风险划分，在低风险抵押\n    池中，应该只放置大交易量的主流币交易对，并提供较低的杠杆系数，比如 1 – 10 倍杠杆；\n    而在高风险抵押池中，除了主流币交易对外，还可以存在中风险的小币种，并提供较高的杠\n    杆率，比如 20 – 50 倍的杠杆；\n    对交易者而言，他可以按自己的风险偏好，选择在不同风险度的 LP 抵押池下进行不同\n    货币对的交易，希望可以获取更高的收益；\n    目前 dFuture 平台存在一个低风险抵押池，其中提供了 BTC/USDT 和 ETH/USDT 的交\n    易对，同时提供开仓 30 倍杠杆。后续通过社区治理，还可以进一步添加交易对和不同的风\n    险抵押池。\n    3\\.8多结算币种支持\n    dFuture 平台可以支持多结算币种，针对同一个 LP 抵押池，只能选择一种基于以太坊\n    发行的结算币种，比如 ERC20-USDT、ETH 等。\n    目前 dFuture 平台只支持 USDT 做为单一结算币种，即用户支付 USDT 进行交易，LP\n    支付 USDT 进行抵押，USDT 做为交易对的底对存在。\n    后续可以通过社区治理，提供不同的 LP 抵押池，以 ETH 或其他 ERC20 的 Token 做为\n    该抵押池的单一结算币种。比如以 ETH 为单一结算币种的 LP 抵押池，此时 LP 只需要存入\n    ETH 做为抵押，交易者也通过支付 ETH 进行交易，交易对以 ETH 为底对，例如\n    USDT/ETH,BTC/ETH 等；\n 7. 平台流动性提供者\n    4\\.1增加流动性\n    LP 希望向平台增加流动性时，只需要向平台的智能合约中存入 USDT，同时获得 LP\n    Token 做为凭证。平台目前认定的结算币种为 USDT，后续可以通过社区治理，添加对更多\n    结算币种的支持，比如 USDC。\n    dFuture 流动性池除了 LP 主动注入外，在如下情况也会发生变化：\n 8. 交易者在亏损的情况下主动平仓或被动爆仓，此时交易者亏损的 USDT 会注入到\n    dFuture 流动性池，此时流动性池的 USDT 会增加；\n 9. 交易者在盈利的情况下平仓，LP 流动性池会将交易者盈利的 USDT 给到交易者账户，\n    此时 LP 流动性池的 USDT 会减少。\n    4\\.2流动性 Token\n    LP 向流动性池注入 USDT，会获得 LP Token。LP Token 用于跟踪每个 LP 贡献的流动\n    性与总流动性池的比例。LP Token 是高度可分割的，同时 LP 可以随时燃烧 LP Token，获\n    得自己之前提供的 USDT。\n    LP 通过向流动性池注入 USDT 获得的 LP Token 的数量，取决于存入的 USDT 数量与当\n    前流动性池总量的比值。可以使用如下公式计算：\n    获得的 LP Token=存入的 USDT 数量*LP Token 总量/平台流动性池 USDT 总量\n    4\\.3流动性回收\n    LP 可以随时燃烧 LP Token，从流动性池中取回其比例的 USDT。交易期间所有的盈亏\n    都会添加到流动性池中，因此，自首次添加流动性以来，所有的营收都会包含到流动性池，\n    LP 可以获得自己对应比例的收益。\n    LP 通过向流动性池发送 LP Token 获得相应份额的 USDT，其金额可以使用如下公式计\n    算：\n    获得的 USDT=平台流动性池 USDT 总量*发送 LP Token 份额/平台 LP Token 总份额\n    由于 LP 抵押池金额与开仓总量相关，为了避免 LP 频繁的进入和退出抵押池导致开仓\n    总量的变化，某个 LP 退出时，系统会收取退出金额的 0.5%的手续费，该手续费会自动分配\n    给当前其他未退出的 LP。\n    4\\.4不同风险波动率的 LP 抵押池\n    dFuture 平台可以支持多个不同风险波动率的 LP 抵押池，同一个 LP 抵押池中可以存在\n    多个不同的交易对，各交易对间裸头寸是共享的，并参与到各交易对的动态手续费和动态持\n    仓利息的计算。\n    通过一个 LP 抵押池支持不同的交易对，与 LP 抵押池只支持一种交易对相比，可以灵\n    活的提升不同交易对的最大开仓头寸，提升 LP 抵押池的资金利用率，从而提升 LP 抵押池\n    的收益率；同时，通过在一个抵押池中集成低风险和中风险的交易对，通过低风险交易对降\n    低抵押池风险，通过中风险交易对提升交易收益，也可以进一步提升 LP 抵押池的收益率。\n    LP 在抵押时，可以根据自己的风险偏好，选择抵押到低风险池还是高风险池，从而选\n    择获取无风险的稳定收益还是选择有风险的高额收益。\n    4\\.5LP 的收益构成\n    LP 选择一个 LP 抵押池完成抵押后，其收益主要由如下几方面构成：\n    I．DFT 分配\n    DFT 伴随报块产出后，30.4%的 DFT 分配给为平台提供流动性抵押的 LP，每个 LP 按其\n    抵押比例获得 30.4%LP 收益中等比例的 DFT；\n    II．风险保障基金\n    风险保障基金包括平仓点差和爆仓费用，用于在交易者穿仓时对 LP 提供一定的保护；\n    平仓点差：平仓时，平台会收取 0.01%的手续费，打入风险保障基金，该部分费用以\n    抵押池的结算币种收取；\n    爆仓费用：持仓保证金率低于当前币种最低档位维持保证金率将被系统强制平仓。平\n    仓时，仓位中剩余金额扣除给数据科学家后的部分将做为爆仓费用，打入风险保障基\n    金，该部分费用以抵押池的结算币种收取，平仓点差和爆仓费用 100%给与 LP；\n    III．退出费\n    某个 LP 退出时，系统会收取退出金额的 0.5%作为手续费，该手续费会自动分配给当\n    前其他未退出的 LP。\n10. DFT\n    DFT 是 dFuture 平台的平台币，其价值支撑来源于平台的部分交易手续费，在 dFuture\n    平台上 DFT 有多种用途。\n    5\\.1 DFT 的发行\n    dFuture 正式运行时将同时发行 DFT。DFT 同时发行在币安智能链 BSC 和火币生态链\n    Heco 上，总量 4 亿，每条链 2 亿，产出完成后将不再产生。\n    5\\.2 DFT 的分配\n    30\\.4% - 交易者收益\n    30\\.4%的 DFT 分配给在平台完成有效交易的交易者。\n    30\\.4% - LP 收益\n    30\\.4%的 DFT 分配给为平台提供流动性抵押的 LP，LP 按其抵押比例获得 30%LP 收益\n    中等比例的 DFT。\n    15\\.2% - LP Token 挖矿\n    15\\.2% 提供给在 MDEX 和 PancakeSwap 上为 DFT 提供流动性的用户，即 LP\n    Token 挖矿。\n    10% - 团队\n    10%的 DFT 做为团队奖励，用于团队运营、技术研发等，上线后 24 个月线性解锁。\n    10% - 私募\n    10% 作为早期投资者份额，为 dFuture 的发展提供更充足有利的资金与资源，上线\n    后 12 个月线性解锁。\n    3% - 空投\n    为了进一步推广 dFuture 平台，我们会针对交易者，Defi 社区成员等潜在用户群体进\n    行多次空投，目前用于空投的 DFT 总量预计为 3%。\n    1% - 社区奖励\n    为了进一步完善平台的功能，奖励社区活动中的积极者，我们预留了 1%的 DFT 用于各\n    项社区活动的奖励。\n    5\\.3 DFT 的功能\n    交易分润\n    dFuture 平台的一项主要收益是来自交易者的交易手续费。当手续费池或利息池净盈\n    亏每增加 1000USDT 时，平台用户可以通过在平台抵押 DFT，按自己抵押 DFT 占总抵押\n    DFT 中的占比，获取平台交易手续费的 40% 的等比例部分，该部分手续费以 USDT 形式\n    支付给用户，抵押的 DFT 在 3 天后可赎回。\n    回购销毁\n    dFuture 平台会将手续费总收入中的 20% 用于回购并销毁 DFT。\n    交易手续费折扣\n    交易者抵押 DFT 后，可以获得交易手续费的打折。\n    LP 锁仓加速\n    LP 可以通过抵押 DFT，让自己抵押 USDT 获取 DFT 的过程加速。LP 在抵押 USDT\n    提供流动性时，也可以抵押 DFT 对自己抵押的 USDT 进行加速。目前 LP 抵押加速时，\n    DFT 与 USDT 的比例为 1：2，就是 1DFT 可以加速 2USDT，抵押的 DFT 在一天后可赎回，\n    但是加速的 USDT 数量不可超过当前已抵押的 USDT 数量\\*2。\n    我们举例说明：\n    LP 抵押了 20 万 USDT，此时他可以再抵押 5 万 DFT，由于 DFT 与 USDT 是 1：2 的抵押\n    关系，相当于其抵押了 30 万的 USDT，该 LP 可以按抵押了 30 万 USDT 获取 DFT。抵押的\n    DFT 可以在 T+1 天后赎回。\n    DAO 治理的投票权\n    所有被抵押的 DFT，包括抵押用于交易分红的 DFT 或者抵押用于 LP 锁仓加速的 DFT，\n    都会获得相应的投票权，社区可以通过投票，对 dFuture 平台的所有参数进行修改和调整，\n    从而满足更多不同的交易者和 LP 需求，比如添加更高风险波动率的 LP 抵押池；添加更多\n    的交易对；添加 ETH、USDC 等更多的交易底对；添加更多的预言机等。\n11. 平台全局风险参数及边界设置介绍\n     裸头寸大于 LP 池金额时，不能开裸头寸方向的仓；\n     裸头寸大于 LP 池金额时，平仓向着裸头寸减小方向时，可以平仓；\n     多单+空单仓位和 > LP 池金额 3 倍时，不能开仓；\n12. 平台收费\n    7\\.1平台费用分配结构\n    交易者在平台交易时，需要支付两部分费用：交易手续费和利息。根据恒定和公式，平\n    台会稳定的产生交易手续费和利息盈余，这些 USDT 将直接按比例打给如下平台参与者：\n    40% 用于对 DFT 质押者进行空投，并链上透明；\n    20% 用于回购并销毁 DFT；\n    20% 用于团队做为运营费用；\n    20% 用于第三方 dex 二池流动性挖矿。\n13. 下一步工作\n    8\\.1关于平台收益动态平衡的设计\n    对一个交易平台而言，交易规则的设计是最重要的，而交易规则中最重要的就是交易收\n    费模式的设计，一个好的交易收费模式，要充分考虑到交易者和平台 LP 之间利益分配的公\n    平合理。如果平台的交易规则偏向 LP，让 LP 获取高额的收益率，而交易者需要缴纳高额的\n    手续费和交易风险，交易者将不愿意来平台交易，从长期看 LP 也无法获取收益；同理，如\n    果平台的交易规则偏向交易者，让 LP 的收益率很低，并长期暴露在风险敞口中，LP 将不愿\n    意为该平台提供流动性，导致交易者的可交易品类和可交易额度都会大幅下降，同时交易深\n    度也会变的糟糕；所以，只有更好的平衡交易者和 LP 之间的利益，一个交易平台才可以长\n    期、稳定、良性的发展。\n    基于以上的考虑，我们考虑在下一个版本中加入收益动态平衡的机制，通过去中心化的\n    链上算法，让交易者与 LP 在平台收益方面处于一种动态平衡的博弈中，让平台可以同时兼\n    顾两者的利益。\n    8\\.2关于进一步提升 LP 收益的设计\n    根据目前动态手续费和动态持仓利息的系统设计，我们预计裸头寸与 LP 池总金额的比\n    例应该长期在 0% - 10% 之间波动，这意味着 LP 池只需要提供 10%的金额就可以满足平台\n    的流动性要求，所以 LP 池 90%的金额都将做为沉淀资金存在。\n    在设定一定比例的准备金后，我们可以采用多种方式将这笔资金利用起来，从而进一步\n    提升 LP 的收益率，例如：\n     存入到类似 curve 的平台，提升收益率；\n     提供类似 Compound 的借贷功能，提升收益率；\n    8\\.3关于优化平台交易对的设计\n    dFuture 在同一个 LP 抵押池中，可以支持有限的多个交易对交易，其中可以包含主流\n    币和非主流币。我们可以针对每个交易对，建立健康度指标，包括日交易量、日交易人数等，\n    每经过一定的交易周期，比如 3 个月，我们可以根据健康度评分，将评分较差的交易对剔除\n    出抵押池，并纳入新的交易对。通过这种方式，我们可以一直保证交易对的活跃度和健康度，\n    一方面提升交易者的交易体验，另一方面可以提升 LP 资金的利用率和收益。", "timestamp": 1634998396, "digest": "m9a-oVWfWhId9yQ2WpanLFjznPbaGheaDV8v4OLzZLA", "contributor": "0xF8B42e3FBEe933f3A2c168d98425F821D4F28847"}

{"id": "b6GwZ55f6fvgrVY0iiqRzeuEDNUHO67LjBLyD7sGdbI", "title": "The Chase of Green Dildos and the Future of A Crypto Utopia", "body": "I always wondered what is the immediate effect of the crypto market to the retail investors that makes them jump into it like “apes” – this is the word that describes the communal sentiment of flocking to a particular crypto project. Hence, I had some difficulty deciding on how to draw a fine line of where “aping” starts and where a well-articulated and thoughtful financial decision is being made.\n\nMy following on my Twitter account shows me how “sentimentally volatile” people are in there and mainly how they hunt down “[Green Dildos](https://www.cryptoemotions.com/dildo-in-cryptocurrency/)”, as they are calling the big green candles when doing their Technical Analysis. Catastrophic, in some sense, as I can’t exclude from the equation how our brains get really addicted to that “Green Dildo” chase, the constant exploration for the “next big gem” that is promising – one way or another – to make us rich… Saw this story many times, and while I am an investor myself and am with full throttle into the blockchain world, I cannot stress enough how precarious this kind of mentality can be, leading (potentially) to mental deterioration and a dreaded sequence of sleepless nights (does this ring a bell for some of you?).\n\n![Ah those sleepless nights...](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b2dHgr9JJRjmDGZdTPELk.jpeg?height=225&width=768)\n\nSure, there have been loads of people out there who have certainly been affected enormously by this, and to be honest I do not see this situation getting less negatively impactful for people, especially, since the crypto-space is constantly evolving.\n\nThe other pattern, I clearly see, is that whenever someone is overly or overtly bearish people start to hate and be very bitter towards them. There is a confirmation bias with regards to how people analyze an asset, do fundamental and technical analysis, and then see what they WANT to see. This is an intrinsic problem which from my understanding is being prominent in not only the crypto-space but, generally, it gloriously spreads to the stock market.\n\nHaving said that, what if we – retail investors – took another approach into how we make our supposedly educated guesses with regards to the cryptoassets (or crypto projects, or whatever you want to call it)? Or we “think” that because we buy into them, these are simultaneously going to explode up-and-up?\n\nDoes our psychology need some optimal priming? Do we really know how we can benefit the most after we fix our mental game…to the highest level possible? [Research](https://www.apa.org/monitor/feb03/overestimate) has already proven how human beings overstimate their ability to make good judgements and choices, as well as their abilities.\n\nYou can, obviously, recognize that a plethora of questions can pop-up if – and that is a big IF – we go into an “inquisitive mind mode”. And by inquisitiveness I want to stress enough and accordingly enhance the phenomenon where someone endeavors to investigate, judge critically, and delve deep into a particular subject that needs important decision-making before you jump in.\n\nThe risk lies beneath the high risk/high reward conundrum that infiltrated the crypto community and which gave the basis for the infamous “pump and dump schemes” (PADS) that have emerged, since the times of ICOs hunting. The PADS, though, are not an (unfortunate) event that is regarded as unprecedented. I will drive a parallel now to the stock market, which you might know that it has those uber-speculative penny stocks that have low trading volume, and means to some extent that their volatility can either “make you or break you”.  The equivalent cryptocurrency pump and dump schemes, thus, can be unfortunate for the speculators who lose and very fortunate for those who gain loads of money on the peak of the pump. To be able to receive those gains, two are the most fundamental features that can distinguish you:\n\n1. To know when to exit by taming your greediness (take profits incrementally on the way up)\n2. To have the know-how on discovering those risky projects, if you think you have the mental strength and capacity to take an “L”(loss), if things don’t turn out as you would have thought.\n\nCompared to the penny stock market, there are exquisite attributes that make the cryptocurrency pump and dump ecosystem yielding rug-pulls that will be reminiscent to the ages of ages.\n\n![It has happened to the best of us I think, especially in the beginning of our crypto journey!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a-ko753YCbMe17HET-zmO.jpg?height=480&width=852)\n\n\nLet’s start, now, with the first significant difference between crypto and penny stock PADS and that is the usage of new technology, with main attention given to the immense impact that some social media platforms have. Two “new-age” specific platforms have their unique contribution into the promotion of PADS: a) Telegram and b) Discord. \n\nI do not think I have to explain why these two, because I am hilariously sure that you and me, and all the people who are well into the crypto-space recognize the popularity and effect of these platforms. Their power into forming communities ready to ape into some (shit)coins cannot be overstated as much as I would like to.\n\nApart from the social media, consider the huge influx of new cryptocurrencies (13.024 at the time of writing) that have been created – and are still being created through the easiness that forking provides. Limitless opportunities for exploitation, manipulation, and rug-pulling for thinly traded coins.\n\nAnd who can neglect (I wonder) the role that numerous unregulated exchanges have played into this? (Shit)coins are being traded with ease, while exchanges are profiting from the transaction fees that are over-bloated due to the pump.\n\nThe endless DeFi innovation, Flash Loans’ birth, DAOs’ incremental adoption, and the constant development of novel cryptocurrencies re-instated the fear of a non-regulated monetary exchange space. It is for this reason that the CFTC, SEC and all the relevant regulatory authorities do not manage (to a significant level so far) “catching” those PADS. The incredibly fast pace of the crypto world and the ever-present strength that aping communities have, alongside the above mentioned technological advancements, do not make crypto-regulation an easy task.\n\nSome of you will argue that tight regulation is not something that we really want and desire. And you may be right on this!\n\nHence, I will personally introduce the notion that there must be some regulation. This necessity, at least in my naïve mind, can be argued by many of you whether it will truly solve or create many other issues.\n\nStill, how can all of us cumulatively protect retail investors from being rug-pulled and lose lifesavings? [Marta](https://twitter.com/martabcalvinho?s=20), on Twitter, has tried to convince me a couple of days ago that WE, the crypto community, can lead the way for the newcomers by being driven from “feelings of empathy” to our fellow crypto friends. It is the community of each coin that makes the project special and great…or the coin we get attached to stops pumping and we forget all the community feelings?\n\n[https://twitter.com/martabcalvinho/status/1451495259528171523?s=20](https://twitter.com/martabcalvinho/status/1451495259528171523?s=20)\n\nMaybe DAOs are one solution, that might take some time to be completely trustless and widely adopted. Creating smart DAOs with equally really smart-contracts which can encode monetary protection through blind scripted bilateral agreements, could be a solution, right?\n\nA selfless, community driven, monetary environment seems itself like a utopia, an outlandish achievement. And I am saying this with full conviction that I can be totally wrong, something that I take full accountability.\n\nSo, because this essay started getting quite big, I will finish with some final thoughts.\n\n> I hope for less PADS through the education of all new crypto adopters, less aggressive marketing strategies that lead to unthinkable levels of aping, “normal” regulatory frameworks, further explored innovation of DAOs and a world that none will be unbanked (or maybe uncrypto-ed?), a world that its people will take care of each other by not only chasing “Green Dildos”, but by being considerate to their crypto “degen frens”!\n\nDon’t hesitate to comment or continue the discussion below on the comment section.\n\nI will try to write more of these (I hope) thought provoking essays, while mediating myself from my biotech job and my passion for the enthralling crypto/blockchain world.\n\nI just need to find more time!\n\n[crowdfund://undefined?features=overview,backers](crowdfund://undefined?features=overview,backers)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635000256, "digest": "4Ombyzu34bVA0Q4FQHrnvYfibjmJwcegg1h4Qh7DtDw", "contributor": "0xdef67F7206b988C28cEFbeD5499bE7B690c111a7"}

This project is specifically and narrowly an attempt to identify things that I enjoy.  So, sometimes, it means I’m going to listen to and ultimately reject music that I know for sure is outstanding, simply because it doesn’t particularly move me or appeal to my taste, which is the case with this album.\n\nIn order to differentiate between what I like and what I know is good, I need to understand what it is I’m looking for.  I want to be emotionally overwhelmed by music.  Usually, the music that sweeps me away is intensely exciting, or dangerous, or heartbreakingly full of longing and desire.  Sometimes, though more rarely, the talent of the artist or the scale of the piece can overwhelm me through sheer splendor, as though being consumed by staring into the enormity of the night sky and outer space.\n\nFor the most part, Nina at the Village Gate feels beautiful and full of love to the point of being serene.  Which, though wonderful, aren’t the types of feelings that overwhelm me (perhaps I am dead inside).  Songs like Just in Time and Bye Bye Blackbird are unquestionably triumphs of artistry, but they just don’t really trigger anything in me.\n\nEven when the tone turns towards feelings that typically do register with me like sadness (He Was Too Good to Me) or a brooding sense of danger (House of the Rising Sun), the performance remains a touch restrained.  To be clear, that restraint results in work that is clearly a great piece of art, just one that I don’t completely connect to.\n\nThat said, this album shines in the moments where the restraint falls away, in moments during Brown Baby and Zungo, and particularly during the album’s final track, Children Go Where I Send You.  This final song is a joyous romp, where Nina’s voice soars and the backing band improvises and swings.  It’s the type of thing I can’t stop from bopping along to, that I can’t help from feeling in my soul, which is the exact type of thing I’m looking to find.", "timestamp": 1635004033, "digest": "Duqgbm10_7hqigjtD2xsAat5XiLCfU6SByfEWOTRr1Y", "contributor": "0x81b48641A6a351DA1E461B9E4ca585d43dBB60E1"}

{"id": "67filgXxzxfB5ozNr8lVTGXjPFQXwZlJnB5auJWqKLg", "title": "10/23日学习笔记", "body": "这两天花了些时间研究了下Cruve的经济系统。可以说是迟来一年的学习。也许是不同区域玩家热衷玩的项目不同，去年DeFi热潮国内玩家为之尖叫疯狂的项目在UNI和YFI，而对 [$CRV](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CRV&src=cashtag_click) 有深入了解的则知之甚少。但Curve作为DeFi流动性挖矿的基建设施重要性不言而喻，实在不可忽略。\n\n在投票治理问题上，Curve显然做的比其他DeFi项目要好。想要获得投票权，必须将CRV质押为veCRV。且veCRV锁仓期只有一年到四年这四种选项。参与治理必须付出代币锁仓的代价。\n\n相比之下，其他项目的治理显得有些轻浮和儿戏，因为投票人不需要做出任何牺牲，可以说是一种白嫖式投票。我们一直呼吁投票治理对协议的重要性，在投票机制上却仍旧处于幼稚期。如果参与Curve的锁仓式投票治理，一定程度上也可抑制Whale的协议操控。\n\nveCRV是Curve系统的基石，主要三种功能：一是用于投票治理，二是能够获得协议50%的交易手续费，三是能够加速LP挖矿。\n\n50%的交易手续费以回购Curve稳定池的LP Token 3CRV的方式回馈给veCRV持有者。如果你参与了Curve挖矿，同时又有veCRV，那么你可以加速挖矿，让挖矿奖励变得更多。在不使用其他系统辅助Curve挖矿的情况下，如果想要获得加速奖励，你是需要既有LP 挖矿又有veCRV的。\n\n而YFI和Convex则是两个最大化veCRV收益率的系统，被称为Curve挖矿的两大伴侣。收益率的提高主要借助了聚合器本身的规模效应以及出色的经济机制设计。\n\n我们都都知道YFI系统内大部分的挖矿都基于Curve底层系统，稳定币yVault本质就是集合了大量的稳定币去Curve挖矿，而获得的奖励CRV，YFI把90%的CRV卖成稳定币继续Compound挖矿，对于yVault的存款者，能看到本金的增长。剩下10%左右的CRV质押成veCRV，YFI系统把它做成了yveCRV Vault。\n\nyveCRV vault是最大化收益率的关键。除了10%的CRV奖励质押进去了，它还接受新的CRV质押。比方说你二级买了一批CRV，现在你有两个选择，一是直接在Curve系统内质押成veCRV吃交易手续费，二是使用yveCRV Vault。相比第一种方式，yveCRV Vault多了YFI系统内10%CRV的质押。这部分便是超额收益的来源。\n\n你便理解了何为YFI聚合收益器的规模效应。yveCRV Vault白嫖了y vault一部分的收益。另一方面，这个vault接受外部CRV的存款，进一步加速y Vault的挖矿奖励，继而再提高了yveCRV的收益。\n\n那yveCRV 获得的手续费奖励呢，YFI把奖励3CRV统一换成CVR复利质押成veCRV，这部分单独再做一个yvBoost Vault，继续加速y Vault挖矿。同时yvBoost在sushiswap上有yvBoost/CRV交易对可以让用户二级退出\n\nConvex使用的则是另外一种策略。YFI是Compound收益，Convex则是把奖励直接分配给用户。另外Convex多了一层CVX流动性挖矿奖励。同样的，用户可以把稳定币质押进Convex Vault，使用的挖矿底层也是Curve。平台会以CRV代币形式抽取16%的平台费。\n\n其中的10%CRV质押成veCRV放进cvxCRV Vault。剩下的5%将CRV质押成veCRV，以veCRV的形式回馈给CVX质押的用户。\n\n对于cvxCRV Vault，可以获得CVX的挖矿奖励，还可以获得以3CRV形式的手续费奖励(这部分不同于YFI复利收益，它直接分配给cvxCRV用户)，同时cxvCRV Vault接受新的CRV质押。\n\ncvxCRV也在sushiswap上有cvxCRV/CRV交易对用户用户二级退出，提供LP可以获得Sushi和CVX的挖矿奖励。不过这里注意如果你选提供交易对，那么你就没办法获得3CRV的手续费奖励。因为在系统中，是需要有质押cvxCRV这一步才能获得3CRV。\n\n以上便是Curve主要的挖矿机制和代币经济系统一览。你可能看着看着就晕了，确实，我一开始也是花了很长时间但愣是没看懂，最后请教了Hope和Molly才得以解惑 [@hope18150618](https://twitter.com/hope18150618) [@bigmagicdao](https://twitter.com/bigmagicdao)\n\n你也明白了为什么当时YFI刚出来时有一种指责声音说YFI在吸血Curve。在经过一年多的发展后，Curve的周边生态不断蓬勃发展，而YFI几近停滞。从市值排名便可看出，如今Curve的市值已经超过YFI。\n\n最近几个月爆发的所谓DeFi 2.0的币种，大多都和Curve的周边生态项目有关。也就是说如果你一开始miss掉了Curve，那么你大概率也会miss掉这些2.0项目。\n\n对我自己来说，作为YFI早期玩家，却一直忽略了Curve这个项目，对Curve系统一无所知。所以你回过头看，去年DeFi热潮赚钱，梭哈和运气的成分还是占了很多，很多项目的机制没有研究透，而有些项目根本没看。不过是站在风口上的一头幸运的罢了。\n\n比方说公链生态，我们经常看到生态母币跑出来的收益是最高的。你去折腾生态项目，不如直接拿着母币。这是我们的思维习惯：买龙头，买母币。\n\n但也有像Curve这种项目。对于Curve宇宙来说，CRV不太赚钱(Whale的提款机)，但是Curve的生态项目极其赚钱。在Curve的案例里，是和公链生态反过来的。也就是说，如果一个项目形成生态，不管母币能否赚钱，依然要关注生态，因为机会可能出现在生态内。\n\n另外要意识到代币经济设计的重要性。好的经济机制，能让项目系统正向运转起来，代币价格也不至于一落千丈。这正是代币经济设计的魔力所在。如果一个币，赛道比较小众，不在趋势热点上，也没有任何亮眼的代币经济机制，那么买这个币，是需要打一个问号的。\n\n最后就是时间的力量。需要给项目足够长的发展时间和空间，就像 [@mindaoyang](https://twitter.com/mindaoyang)老师说的，每个人的投资决策都受限于当时的情境，但项目的发展是动态进程。都说日久见人心吗。你看这不CRV市值超过了YFI。同时也要鸣谢 [@RiceMaximalist](https://twitter.com/RiceMaximalist) 让我意识到Curve的重要性。\n\nmindao：\n\n1/ DeFi里，Curve是个特殊的存在。本来想写个长文分析DeFi的不同估值，这里先在原帖上加些我个人的观察。 Curve最大的问题是FDV，很多人不知道，大户很多从52美金一路卖，高频的时候每天claim 8次卖。即使现在看FDV仍高达100亿美金。 它锁仓实际上是用时间换高估值，用不稳定换稳定， 做再次分配。\n\n2/ Curve的锁仓超过170亿美金，每天的交易量基本也就1亿美金这个水平。资本效率只有0.5%，这个是极其低的资本效率。补贴量大概每年接近5-10亿美金。为什么维持这么高额的补贴。首先，补贴有利于提高TVL，这样能维持“高估值”，虽然swap应该看交易量，但是散户更相信TVL。\n\n3/ 其次，超额补贴实际上是把一路下跌的币，卖成稳定的手续费收入，最后大额分给长期质押的大户，完成高价卖币和短线、长期持币人再分配。 另外，还有一个重要作用，就是帮助相关项目实现估值杠杆。 有不少项目完全靠curve带动，比如YFI, CVX, MIM，四两拨千斤。\n\n4/ 比如MIM，Curve大概32%分配给这个池子，一年2-3亿美金的补贴，撑起Spell 近40亿美金的FDV，将近20倍的杠杆。 我初略估计，Curve通过估值杠杆撬动的相关项目的市值，超过100亿美金。 至于估值撬动，是为了内部人获益还是最终实现体系良性循环，可能要放在更长时间维度看，但这也算是一种打法吧。\n\n\n5/ 有意思的是，这种估值撬动，实际上可以多重套娃，比如YFI起来了，可以带动CVX， MIM，而且互相TVL可以重复计算，推高各自的实际估值，最终实际估值杠杆可能超过50倍。", "timestamp": 1635005351, "digest": "cPpmYwt5HlVonaBvQrvWL_rjBltRioAIGul0IGAhu3U", "contributor": "0x3dD38521DDd6c73D2652d013f4aAc691d8f50BB9"}

They have to be flexible with risk and failure while *also* be motivated in the process of “forging new paths” for their company¹. This demands **strenuous self-confidence and self-awareness** that not everyone can maintain.\n\nAnd in business, Noam Wasserma dubbed this extraordinary nature found in leading entrepreneurs as the “Founder’s Dilemma.” In his [Harvard Business Review,](https://hbr.org/2008/02/the-founders-dilemma.) Wasserman analyzes this instinctual behavior that exists in the *tiny* margin of entrepreneurs who succeed in making decisions for their companies and themselves.\n\n#### This is the reason why so many of us become obsessed with the nature of startups.\n\nIn fact, Silicon Valley has come to interpret this behavior as none other than **Stoicism**, an ancient Greek philosophy.\n\n> “An ancient Greek school of thought, Stoicism argued that the only real treasures in life were inner virtues, like self-mastery and courage. The Stoics offered tactics to endure pain and pleasure without complaint.” — [Nellie Bowles for NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/style/silicon-valley-stoics.html)\n\nOutside its typical definition, Stoic ethics provides a refreshing attitude to self-awareness and practicality that has remained timeless. Thus, giving way to a mentality that was built for the cyclic pattern of flux and change found in entrepreneurship.\n\nEven if we don’t have any current entrepreneurial endeavors, we can still learn a lot from Stoic practices just as it has influenced generations of leaders: from US presidents to Roman Emperors.\n\nBut how exactly does Stoicism benefit the modern entrepreneur in this **present period of accelerated innovation?**\n\n### Introspection\n\nBefore we jump into any complex theories, it is important to understand that Stoicism is situated within a very particular conception of what philosophy is: **more than a series of claims, but a way of life.**\n\nSo while entrepreneurs might not follow Stoic principles to its exact words, they certainly respect its humility and feel empowered by its introspective nature.\n\nIts founder, Zeno, often compared his teaching style to “a patient describing the progress of his treatment to fellow patients in the hospital beds beside him”.\n\n(If only our professors were just as humble…)\n\nFor once, Zeno was a teacher who modeled his own teachings on self-development. This demeanor has inspired many business leaders such as CEO Eugenio Pace to “model what they preach” to stay accountable¹.\n\nSilicon Valley has long been criticized for its **hypocrisy**: many large technology companies have run into countless scandals due to unethical management. Therefore, more than ever are entrepreneurs focusing on their own business ethics.\n\n### Self-Improvement\n\nThis next Stoic practice is *quite* the buzzword for business-management, transforming into its own profession known as executive coaching.\n\n#### Managing a company relies heavily on how the entrepreneur approaches his or her internal battles because it can influence their overall motivation.\n\nResearch done by organizational psychologists suggests that the ability to “see ourselves clearly” can correspond to better confidence and creativity levels. Thus, helping business leaders make sounder decisions, build stronger relationships, and communicate more effectively³.\n\nThat is why many Stoics see Greek statesmen Seneca as an archetype of self-development. Under the infamous Nero, Seneca varied from massive wealth, exile, and teetering reputation, but Stoicism remained his main tool for motivation.\n\n*Disclaimer:* Seneca’s practices in Stoicism by no means excused him from unjust behavior. Critics describe him as [“a hypocrite almost without equal in the ancient world”](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/stoic-2.) (big yikes).\n\nBut like his mentor Zeno, Seneca was fully attune to this paradox. He wrote in his “Letters From a Stoic”:\n\n> “Naturally, there are a lot of things about me requiring to be built up or fined down or eliminated, \\[but\\] the fact that it perceives the failings it was unaware of in itself before, is evidence of a change for the better in one’s character.”\n\nSeneca understood well that he was imperfect and that his life of wealth and power required introspection and self-awareness. Therefore, Seneca is ultimately deemed both as[ “a hypocrite ](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/stoic-2.)*[and](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/stoic-2.)*[ as a ](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/stoic-2.)**[force of moral restraint.”](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/stoic-2.)**\n\nStoicism can help us cope with any internalized burden of tremendous responsibility or power. CEOs like Chris Myers practice self-awareness to remind themselves to be patient, empathetic, and strong in the never-ending cycle of challenges.\n\n### Practicality\n\nStepping back for a second, it’s important to observe that modern philosophy has mostly become an intellectual activity, practiced from the comfort of our armchair⁴.\n\n#### But for the ancient Stoics, philosophy was a full-body workout…\n\n![Mike Lemanski](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nZ5H2Q_9F7VvDOkPxYR6Y.jpeg?height=1065&width=1600)\n\nThey celebrated both **physical toughness and mental acumen**. And this is certainly observed through Emperor Marcus Aurelius, who popularized the practice of journaling to build self-awareness and motivation.\n\nWhile directing military campaigns, he wrote twelve private journals titled “To Himself” that was later renamed “Meditations”. His books were initially meant for personal clarity and not for public benefit. More so because Marcus used journaling as a weapon to **revive his commitment to a virtue-centered life.**\n\nQuantifying the self like this is particularly attractive to the entrepreneurial mindset who enjoys analyzing progress. As a result, journaling has returned to modern business practices as the hallmark of the self-care movement.\n\nExtensive behavioral and scientific studies by Harvard Business encourage entrepreneurs to reap the benefits of journaling in mindfulness, memory, and communication skills⁵. In an equal sense, modern-day journaling and Stoicism encourages us to dedicate ourselves to things within our control — such as our wellbeing.\n\n### Rationalization\n\nGoing off this idea, Stoicism teaches us to realize that [“only our thoughts and intentions are truly within our sphere of control”](http://www.forbes.com/sites/carriesheffield/2013/12/01/want-an-unconquerable-mind-try-stoic-philosophy/#70b05b32750c) while everything else is governed by what’s “best” for the universe. For entrepreneurs, this framework provides them reassurance through internal rationalization.\n\nThis outlook can be easily confused with pessimism. But this **stereotypical** **Stoic** **indifference** is meant to guide us through hardships.\n\nMy favorite example is with materialistic goals: wealth (drip drip) is seen as uncontrollable because it only leads to a cycle of dissatisfaction and unhappiness. We can find tremendous reassurance in this rationale if we let it liberate us from the pursuit of material goals that often corrupts us.\n\n![Julia Schwarz](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sKJMILMxemv_HJi7uftT1.jpeg?height=481&width=512)\n\nTherefore in entrepreneurship, Stoicism mitigates similar unhealthy [“satisfaction treadmills”](http://www.forbes.com/sites/chrismyers/2018/03/08/how-one-struggling-entrepreneur-found-solace-in-the-ancient-philosophy-of-stoicism/#51999e53d06c.) of hedonic adaptation.\n\n#### The most important thing is that it helps entrepreneurs accept the limits of their power without slumping into passivity.\n\nModern Stoic and CEO Aytekin Tank notes that entrepreneurship’s recurring challenges are staying positive and maintaining momentum: so while entrepreneurs can’t control every factor that could affect their companies, Stoicism can at least help them “control \\[their\\] actions and reaction”.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStoicism provides us an internal fortress to make the best decisions in times of risk and failure. So although it can’t provide exact answers, Stoicism can provide a [“practical framework for entrepreneurs to navigate the uncertainties they encounter.”](http://www.forbes.com/sites/chrismyers/2018/03/08/how-one-struggling-entrepreneur-found-solace-in-the-ancient-philosophy-of-stoicism/#51999e53d06c.)\n\nHopefully, Stoic practices will **empower you** just as it did to leaders from every sector to take up the challenges of building a company.\n\n\n---\n\n\\[1\\]: Pace, Eugenio. “Council Post: Can Philosophy Influence Business?

DAOs have used DAOhaus software to raise more than $50m and distribute almost $20m. On the Daohaus platform, you can discover and join existing DAOs, as well as launch your own. Launching a DAO on Daohaus provides a landing page where others can pledge to join.\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll learn the core actions to participating in a DAOHaus DAO: How to join a DAO, create a proposal, sponsor a proposal, vote on a proposal and process a proposal.\n\n## Join the DAOHaus Discord\n\n1. Join DAOhaus discord #haus-roles to get Scholar role\n2. Use the !join command to get the foundations roles.\n\n[https://discord.gg/daohaus](https://discord.gg/daohaus)\n\n## Join the FoundationsDAO\n\nYou will need to follow the steps in this first section to join as a member of FoundationsDAO. Before you can make a proposal you’ll need to acquire at least 1 HAUS token and at least 0.05 Wrapped xDai.\n\n### Acquire at least 1 HAUS token and at least 0.05 Wrapped xDai\n\n* Make sure you have added the xDAI network to your Metamask and bridge DAI to xDAI.\n  * You will need to bridge enough xDAI to get at least 1 HAUS token and 0.05 Wrapped xDai to be able to sponsor someone’s proposal.\n  * [Tutorial: Add the xDAI network to your Metamask and Bridge DAI to xDAI](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/Oxs8NXUGG2Gz4FsNmh509tBj5LEzJNvpt_IAYOFRVmg)\n* Get HAUS from a DEX (Decentralized Exchange). You will need acquire 1 HAUS for this quest.\n  * We recommend using Honeyswap: <https://app.honeyswap.org/#/swap>\n    * Select xDAI and HAUS.\n    * Exchange xDAI for 1 HAUS.\n    * You can add the HAUS token to your Metamask using the HAUS token contract: 0xb0c5f3100a4d9d9532a4cfd68c55f1ae8da987eb\n* Get Wrapped xDAI so you can sponsor someone’s proposal.\n* You’ll need at least 0.05 Wrapped xDai to sponsor someone’s proposal.\n  * [Tutorial: How to convert xDAI to Wrapped xDAI (WrapETH)](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/vJ8aJ5-aPvTV4V7HDckT430KfsASqtsIsNOHRPIQPzc)\n\n### Make a proposal in FoundationsDAO\n\n* Open the [DAOHaus App](https://app.daohaus.club/).\n* Find the [FoundationsDAO](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0x1b975a9daf25e7b01e0a6c72d657ff74925327a8) in the [DAOHaus Explorer](https://app.daohaus.club/explore).\n* Click on “New Proposal +”\n* Select “Request shares for tokens”:\n  * Request Shares For Tokens\n    * Title: Request to Join The FoundationsDAO\n    * Shares Requested: 1 Share\n    * Tribute Offered: 1 HAUS\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qexi8I_SF1f0TSNq_dHwV.png?height=1232&width=1139)\n\n* Unlock HAUS token\n* You have to wait until it shows that the token has been approved.\n* It will tell you that a proposal has been submitted in the top right notifications in green. Wait 24 hours for someone to sponsor your post\n\nOnce the vote and grace period has past, you will become a member of the FoundationsDAO, and gain new privileges. Some of those privileges include:  sponsoring proposals, voting on proposals and processing proposals. We will walk through those processes in the following sections.\n\n## Sponsor a proposal\n\nYou may recall that when you created a proposal to be admitted into the DAO, a member of the DAO is needed to sponsor your proposal before it was put up for a vote. Now that you are a member of the DAO you have the ability to sponsor new proposals.\n\n***NOTE:*** You are able to sponsor proposals that are created by others as well as your own.\n\n### 1. Find a proposal to sponsor\n\nOn the proposals page you can use the “Filter By” dropdown menu to select “Unsponsored” to load all proposals that need to be sponsored. The first line of each proposal will tell you what kind of proposal it is. Remember: you are now a contributing member of a DAO and it is every member’s responsibility to learn what each proposal will do before sponsoring or voting on it. Take the time to browse the open proposals and select one that you would like to sponsor.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5XrxLkqPdGv6WTCcON2a9.png?height=681&width=1175)\n\n### 2. Review proposal\n\nWhen you click into a proposal you will be able to read more information about it. Just like you needed to do when you requested to join the DAO, you will see the amount the person has put up as “Tribute” (will add to the DAO treasury) to join, and how many shares they wish to receive in return. For the FoundationsDAO it is reasonable to request 1 Share in exchange for 1 HAUS. For more complex proposals there can also be a link to the forum where discussion should happen before a proposal should be sponsored and voted on.\n\n***NOTE***: If the person is asking for more than 1 share for tributing 1 HAUS it should not be sponsored.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YkybgnwT5u58YsrLA9H8p.png?height=459&width=1081)\n\n### 3. Sponsor the proposal\n\nIf you are convinced that the proposal is worthy of being voted on, then you can sponsor it by depositing 0.05 Wrapped xDai.  If you don’t already have this you can follow the tutorial to learn how to wrap xDai (the native token of the xDai network): [Tutorial: How to convert xDAI to Wrapped xDAI (WrapETH)](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/vJ8aJ5-aPvTV4V7HDckT430KfsASqtsIsNOHRPIQPzc)\n\nNaturally you will need to approve the contract to access the Wrapped xDai in your wallet first, but then you can click the “Sponsor” button, approve the transaction and that’s it.\n\n***NOTE:*** This deposit will be returned to you once the proposal has been processed. (Minus the reward for processing, if one has been selected.)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DnjFwz4D6K-vaJ-mHNcRJ.png?height=246&width=728)\n\n## Vote on a proposal\n\nOnce a proposal has been sponsored, it will take a minute or so to be able to be voted on.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lvCjLcbkzYQNP2chP-ew0.png?height=174&width=1047)\n\nAfter waiting a minute refresh the page and you will see that the proposal is up for a vote for the next 24 hours. You can then click on the green thumbs up icon to vote Yes, or the red thumbs down icon to vote No. Once you click on one a transaction window will pop up for you to approve and cast your vote. After 24 hours whether the vote passes or fails, it will go into the “grace period” this will give any DAO members that do not agree with the outcome of the vote the opportunity to “ragequit” by cashing their DAO shares in for an appropriate amount of funds from the treasury. This is a common feature of a Moloch DAO.\n\n***NOTE:*** Voting Yes or No will complete the RabbitHole Task.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tLUVcmYiptbXQxwg0pu7r.png?height=282&width=1008)\n\n## Process a Proposal\n\nOnce the grace period ends the proposal will be ready to be processed. If the vote failed the proposal will simply be discarded, but if the vote passed, then the proposal will be enacted. In the case of a Member Request proposal, the person that requested will be admitted into the DAO, their tribute will be added to the treasury, and they will gain the amount of shares they requested.\n\nOn the proposals page you can use the “Filter By” dropdown menu to select “Ready for Processing” to load all proposals that are ready to process.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uwrr16tvWfltbI2h1u3DI.png?height=619&width=1177)\n\nClick into the proposal and then click the “Process” button under the Actions heading on the right of the page. You will then need to confirm the transaction, and once it has gone through the proposal will be processed.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RWNp1akr6ZXZSZ8SgUA-7.png?height=315&width=734)\n\n**And that’s it! You now know how to create a proposal, sponsor a proposal, vote on a proposal and process a proposal. These are core actions to participating in a DAOHaus DAO.**\n\n*Always remember to return to the RabbitHole site in order to redeem each Task and then mark the Quest/Skill as complete within the timeframe so that you will be eligible for the reward.*", "timestamp": 1635017361, "digest": "AUpjJ4SZJL-7JqnWkF88SlKn2-znrWVo1zJrkHtZgsI", "contributor": "0x57eFCc7607CD2da49D73E8F9C88ed114CbdC5CF7"}

What if we all stop, look around and acknowledge the trauma? What if we all lean into those quiet moments of fear and explore the emotion that is behind the fear itself?

Instead, we learn to distract ourselves from it, insulate, and deflect. The irony is that pain cannot be avoided.

Are we even capable of such a thing? Can we turn to the wisdom of ancient tribal communities who lived harmoniously with nature on this planet and employ their approach of balancing the masculine and feminine to restore our ability to survive on this planet and navigate the collective trauma of our present and the coming chaos of our immediate future?\n\nI believe we’re rapidly moving past the question of “can we?” We are now facing the reality that “we must.”\n\n**We must process our collective trauma. We must hold space for our communities to heal. We must embrace sacred wisdom. We must balance the masculine with the feminine so our planet can heal. And survive.**\n\n*Work Cited*\n\nMitchell, Sherri L, and Larry Dossey. *Sacred Instructions : Sacred Instructions : Indigenous Wisdom for Living Spirit-Based Change / Indigenous Wisdom for Living Spirit-Based Change*.

Group trauma can lead to distorted thinking, which often manifests as internalized oppression, as people try to maintain some sense of misplaced control over the circumstances of their oppression. In addition, trauma from long-stranding oppression can leave the group huddled together in a form of stagnated solidarity. When anyone tries to move beyond the place of suffering that the group has occupied, they are attacked by the group and brought back down (Mitchell 56).\n\nWhen layered a top a large population of people already traumatized from the long term impacts of climate crisis and the kleptocracy-capitalism hybrid many of us are navigating along with massive inequality and economic disruption, **it’s no wonder why massive portions of the population are clinging to disinformation that makes them feel empowered over their own lives.** It’s no wonder that identity politics have now reached full scale destruction.\n\n![Stop the Bans protest in Wilmington, NC 2019.

Mass conspiracies thrive in such an environment of group trauma by providing a means of mutual belief and connection.\n\nAt a very young age, we are taught in western society to ignore our pain and muscle through. We’re taught that pain is weakness and that to feel and express emotions is not something that strong, independent people do. We’re taught that to survive in this world we must “pull ourselves up by our bootstraps” and suffer through whatever pain or trauma has been thrown at us over the span of our lifetimes. **We are taught to internalize the oppressor’s systems of control and blame ourselves for the inequalities baked into our societal fabrics.**\n\nAt a very young age we are taught to accept the means of oppression baked into our social structures and to never question the means or motives of the oppressor. **We accept the consumption based economy and the patriarchal laws as reality,** something we must accept and can not change or push back upon. We believe the narrative of war and destruction as a necessary reality to protect our existence on this planet.\n\n![Stop the Bans protest in Wilmington, NC 2019.

I’m finally able to create my first blog entry on Mirror since the [platform has recently been opened up to everyone](https://dev.mirror.xyz/valptw8S9eZ1cvzX-JCGga2N_W2hXyurSYbOlNFj4OQ) which is great news as I’ve been a fan of Mirror since I first discovered some of my favourite writers and creators in the Web3.0 space using it for a variety of interesting experiments.\n\nI’ve written a couple of posts on my personal website but i’m going to be posting exclusively on Mirror going forward 😁\n\n## Why Mirror? \n\nI’m hypothesising that web 3.0 is going to be bigger than any of us realise and that this platform will play a big part, largely because the team behind Mirror is helping to shape the future of content creation, curation, monetisation & distribution using the blockchain. \n\nI’ve participated in a few crowd funds and NFT sales on Mirror and having done so, I can’t see how this way of supporting and funding creators isn’t going to explode. So, I’m here to get in early and hopefully grow my audience as Mirror grows using all the current and yet-to-be released features the platform offers. \n\n## What will I be creating content about? \n\nI see web3.0 / blockchain being a major element of our lives in the future and believe that we’re only just seeing the first use cases (e.g. Cryptocurrencies and NFT’s) being talked about in the mainstream - Soon social tokens and DAO’s (Decentralised Autonomous Organisations) will be added to that list, as well as other concepts we can’t yet imagine.\n\nMore tools & services will undoubtedly spring up to power the amazing web 3.0 ideas that folks are pursuing and with this in mind, I intend to create content about these tools/services/concepts to build understanding amongst my audience of the value they can add and how they can be used.\n\nI’m thinking my content creation engine will look something like this:\n\n* Create a video (perhaps weekly) on a new web 3.0 tool / service and post it on YouTube\n* Write an article here on Mirror building on the content in the video\n* Notify my audience of the latest content via a related newsletter, as well as on Twitter and Instagram. \n\nI might eventually spin up a community (gated with social tokens/NFTs) for my audience to engage with one another further down the line but I’ll focus initially on simply delivering as much value via the channels mentioned above as I can.\n\nI’ve already gotten 100 or so folks signed up to my newsletter so hopefully this is an early sign that the topics i’m intending on covering are of interest to at least a small pool of people!

{"id": "nIJTSlruowGY-3tMOzHCA4TFVnzZ551NU94b7lb1eOU", "title": "ERC 4337: account abstraction without Ethereum protocol changes", "body": "[Account abstraction](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/account-abstraction/) has for a long time been a dream of the Ethereum developer community. Instead of EVM code just being used to implement the *logic of applications*, it would also be used to implement the *verification logic* (nonces, signatures…) of individual users’ wallets. This would open the door for creativity in wallet designs that could provide some important features:\n\n* Multisigs and [social recovery](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html)\n* More efficient and simpler signature algorithms (eg. Schnorr, BLS)\n* Post-quantum safe signature algorithms (eg. Lamport, Winternitz)\n* Upgradeability\n\nIt is possible to do all of these things with smart contract wallets today, but the fact that the Ethereum protocol itself requires everything to be packaged in a transaction originating from an ECDSA-secured externally-owned account (EOA) makes this very difficult. Every user operation needs to be wrapped by a transaction from an EOA, adding 21000 gas of overhead. The user needs to either have ETH in a separate EOA to pay for gas, and manage balances in two accounts, or rely on a relay system, which are typically centralized.\n\n[EIP 2938](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2938) is one path toward fixing this, by introducing some Ethereum protocol changes that allow top-level Ethereum transactions to start from a contract instead of an EOA. The contract itself would have verification and fee payment logic that miners would check for. However, this requires significant protocol changes at a time when protocol developers are focusing heavily on the merge and scalability. In our new proposal ([ERC 4337](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/3fd65b1a782912bfc18cb975c62c55f733c7c96e/EIPS/eip-4337.md)), we provide a way to achieve the same gains without consensus-layer protocol changes.\n\n# How does this proposal work?\n\nInstead of modifying the logic of the consensus layer itself, we replicate the functionality of the transaction mempool in a higher-level system. Users send `UserOperation` objects that package up the user’s intent along with signatures and other data for verification. Either miners or bundlers using services such as Flashbots can package up a set of `UserOperation` objects into a single “bundle transaction”, which then gets included into an Ethereum block.\n\nThe bundler pays the fee for the bundle transaction in ETH, and gets compensated though fees paid as part of all the individual `UserOperation` executions. Bundlers would choose which `UserOperation` objects to include based on similar fee-prioritization logic to how miners operate in the existing transaction mempool. A `UserOperation` looks like a transaction; it’s an ABI-encoded struct that includes fields such as:\n\n* `sender`: the wallet making the operation\n* `nonce` and `signature`: parameters passed into the wallet’s verification function so the wallet can verify an operation\n* `initCode`: the init code to create the wallet with if the wallet does not exist yet\n* `callData`: what data to call the wallet with for the actual execution step\n\nThe remaining fields have to do with gas and fee management; a complete list of fields can be found in the [ERC 4337](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/3fd65b1a782912bfc18cb975c62c55f733c7c96e/EIPS/eip-4337.md) spec.\n\nA wallet is a smart contract, and is required to have two functions:\n\n* `validateUserOp`, which takes a `UserOperation` as input. This function is supposed to verify the signature and nonce on the `UserOperation`, pay the fee and increment the nonce if verification succeeds, and throw an exception if verification fails.\n* An op execution function, that interprets calldata as an instruction for the wallet to take actions. How this function interprets the calldata and what it does as a result is completely open-ended; but we expect most common behavior would be to parse the calldata as an instruction for the wallet to make one or more calls.\n\nTo simplify the wallet’s logic, much of the complicated smart contract trickery needed to ensure safety is done not in the wallet itself, but in a global contract called the **entry point**. The `validateUserOp` and execution functions are expected to be gated with `require(msg.sender == ENTRY_POINT)`, so only the trusted entry point can cause a wallet to perform any actions or pay fees. The entry point only makes an arbitrary call to a wallet after `validateUserOp` with a `UserOperation` carrying that calldata has already succeeded, so this is sufficient to protect wallets from attacks. The entry point is also responsible for creating a wallet using the provided `initCode` if the wallet does not exist already.\n\n*Entry point control flow when running* `handleOps`\n\nThere are some restrictions that mempool nodes and bundlers need to enforce on what `validateUserOp` can do: particularly, the `validateUserOp` execution cannot read or write storage of other contracts, it cannot use environment opcodes such as `TIMESTAMP`, and it cannot call other contracts unless those contracts are provably not capable of self-destructing. This is needed to ensure that a *simulated execution* of `validateUserOp`, used by bundlers and `UserOperation` mempool nodes to verify that a given `UserOperation` is okay to include or forward, will have the same effect if it is actually included into a future block.\n\nIf a `UserOperation`'s verification has been simulated successfully, the `UserOperation` is guaranteed to be includable until the `sender` account has some other internal state change (because of another `UserOperation` with the same sender or another contract calling into the sender; in either case, triggering this condition *for one account* requires spending 7500+ gas on-chain). Additionally, a `UserOperation` specifies a gas limit for the `validateUserOp` step, and mempool nodes and bundlers will reject it unless this gas limit is very small (eg. under 200000). These restrictions replicate the key properties of existing Ethereum transactions that keep the mempool safe from DoS attacks. Bundlers and mempool nodes can use logic similar to today’s Ethereum transaction handling logic to determine whether or not to include or forward a `UserOperation`.\n\n# What properties does this design add, maintain and sacrifice compared to the regular Ethereum transaction mempool?\n\nMaintained properties:\n\n* **No centralized actors**; everything is done through a peer-to-peer mempool\n* **DoS safety** (a `UserOperation` that passes simulation checks is guaranteed to be includable until the `sender` has another state change, which would require the attacker to pay 7500+ gas per `sender`)\n* **No user-side wallet setup complexity**: users do not have to care about whether or not their wallet contract has been “already published”; wallets exist at deterministic CREATE2 addresses, and if a wallet does not yet exist the first `UserOperation` creates it automatically\n* **Full EIP 1559 support**, including fee-setting simplicity (users can set a fixed fee premium and a high max total fee, and expect to be included quickly and charged fairly)\n* **Ability to replace-by-fee**, sending a new `UserOperation` with a significantly higher premium than the old one to replace the operation or get it included faster\n\nNew benefits:\n\n* **Verification logic flexibility**: the `validateUserOp` function can add arbitrary signature and nonce verification logic (new signature schemes, multisig…)\n* **Sufficient to make the execution layer quantum-safe**: if this proposal gets universally adopted, no further work on the execution layer needs to be done for quantum-safety. Users can individually upgrade their wallets to quantum-safe ones. Even the wrapper transaction is safe, as the miner can use a new freshly created and hence hash-protected EOA for each bundle transaction and not publish the transaction before it is added in a block.\n* **Wallet upgradeability**: wallet verification logic can be stateful, so wallets can change their public keys or (if published with DELEGATECALL) upgrade their code entirely.\n* **Execution logic flexibility**: wallets can add custom logic for the execution step, eg. making atomic multi-operations (a key goal of [EIP 3074](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3074))\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n* **Slightly increased DoS vulnerability** despite the protocol’s best effort, simply because verification logic is allowed to be somewhat more complex than the status quo of a single ECDSA verification.\n* **Gas overhead**: somewhat more gas overhead than regular transactions (though made up for in some use cases by multi-operation support).\n* **One transaction at a time**: accounts cannot queue up and send multiple transactions into the mempool. However, the ability to do atomic multi-operations makes this feature much less necessary.\n\n# Sponsorship with paymasters\n\nSponsored transactions have a number of key use cases. The most commonly cited desired use cases are:\n\n1. Allowing application developers to pay fees on behalf of their users\n2. Allowing users to pay fees in ERC20 tokens, with a contract serving as an intermediary to collect the ERC20s and pay in ETH\n\nThis proposal can support this functionality through a built-in **paymaster** mechanism. A `UserOperation` can set another address as its paymaster. If the paymaster is set (ie. nonzero), during the verification step the entry point also calls the paymaster to verify that the paymaster is willing to pay for the `UserOperation`. If it is, then fees are taken out of the paymaster’s ETH staked inside the entry point (with a withdrawal delay for security) instead of the wallet. During the execution step, the wallet is called with the calldata in the `UserOperation` as normal, but after that the paymaster is called with `postOp`.\n\nExample workflows for the above two use cases are:\n\n* The paymaster verifies that the `paymasterData` contains a signature from the sponsor, verifying that the sponsor is willing to pay for the `UserOperation`. If the signature is valid, the paymaster accepts and the fees for the `UserOperation` get paid out of the sponsor’s stake.\n* The paymaster verifies that the `sender` wallet has enough ERC20 balance available to pay for the `UserOperation`. If it does, the paymaster accepts and pays the ETH fees, and then claims the ERC20 tokens as compensation in the `postOp` (if the `postOp` fails because the `UserOperation` drained the ERC20 balance, the execution will revert and `postOp` will get called again, so the paymaster always gets paid). Note that for now, this can only be done if the ERC20 is a wrapper token managed by the paymaster itself.\n\nNote particularly that in the second case, the paymaster can be purely passive, perhaps with the exception of occasional rebalancing and parameter re-setting. This is a drastic improvement over existing sponsorship attempts, that required the paymaster to be always online to actively wrap individual transactions.\n\n# How far along is this proposal?\n\nERC 4337 can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/3fd65b1a782912bfc18cb975c62c55f733c7c96e/EIPS/eip-4337.md). There is an implementation in progress [here](https://github.com/opengsn/account-abstraction/tree/main/contracts).

However, like all economic activity, the effective coordination of human behavior, even with the most basic of government institutions, has a cost. How do we pay for that cost? As we all know, the government’s primary method of collecting revenue in order to fund its operation is through levying some sort of tax system. Symmetrically, a tax you pay is a yearly subscription to access the government’s services where you live. Unlike a subscription service for a product like Netflix, which is a fixed cost between multiple tiers, the subscription cost for government services is a percentage of the income you make. A fundamental difference.\n\nThe business model the government effectively runs on is as follows: providing certain services at free or reduced costs to its citizens by charging them a % rate of their income for access to that service. It hopes that the access to the service increases the wealth of its citizenry and therefore covers the cost of providing that service. It can provide healthcare for free because healthier people produce more tax dollars. It can provide education for free since better educated individuals produce more tax dollars. It can provide legal and financial services for free for the same exact reason — people with access to the service will be richer in the future. So the government makes money by making its citizens richer and taking a percentage of that newly increased amount.\n\nThis is antipodal to the business models of nearly every private sector company. Private sector companies make money by charging a flat rate for the acquisition of their product or service. Therefore they, typically, provide their products and services only to those who can afford their upfront cost or who can afford the cost of any financing options. Despite the fact that government’s business model is ostensibly better for consumers, government’s incentives, if not aligning *against* consumers, don’t always align *towards* consumers’ goals. Whether it be due to regulatory red-tape, partisanship or bureaucratic quagmire, government services often fall short of fulfilling the goals that legislatures originally set out to achieve and, more importantly, the needs of those who could be helped the most.\n\nHeroic wants to make it possible for private companies to provide such services by offering them a new revenue model. We seek to remedy the flaws of our modern economy by combining the consumer-centric approach of government with the profit-based incentives of private corporations. The underpinnings of this solution? Income share agreements (ISAs). Income share agreements are a contract in which you agree to pay a certain percentage of your income for some period of time in the future, in return for a product or service. ISAs realign corporate incentives with the long-term success of their customers while affording them significant upside. They work on a very similar revenue model as the government — providing access to services at a free or reduced cost with an ISA contract so that the service provider makes money on the increase in wealth the service endows to the customer. Doing so lets private enterprises radically expand the number of customers they can serve and compete in new markets that weren’t open to them before.\n\nWhen creating our base product, we looked to the service most fundamental in our modern economy — financial services. Financial services are the building blocks of our economy, but can also be the most exploitative industry towards the working class. In months where workers experience a decrease in hours or other unexpected shifts in income, but still have constant and sometimes increasing living expenses, they are often forced to use high interest credit products such as pay-day loans, title loans, pawn loans, or credit card debt, just to make ends meet.\n\n![Low Income Neighborhoods Are Choke Full of Predatory Lenders. Source: Oklahoma Gazette](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8279554-1f6e-431f-96b7-882ad69b069f_680x336.jpeg)\n\nThis often leads to the repayment of fees, interest and principal amounting to many multiples of the initial loan amount at the detriment of their credit score, making future interest rates even higher and financial services less accessible. This further reduces their ability to save and acquire both tangible and intangible assets — such as an education, modern technological tools, vehicles, etc. — that could drastically increase their earning potential. Often times interest burdens combined with income volatility cause people to default, thus making creditors increase their interest rates in response. A vicious cycle on both fronts.\n\nFurthermore, products and services tend to be more expensive for the poor as they do not have the upfront capital to acquire bulk goods that are much cheaper on a unit economic basis. Financial services business model is fundamentally misaligned with the long term economic health of the worker.\n\nWe provide short term, no interest loans to customers. Customers gain access initially by paying the ISA only during the term length of the loan, but once they see the value in such a financial instrument, we hope to sign them on to a 1–2 year contract under which we take a 1% or less share of their income each month. When they make no income, we make no income, but they can still access their credit line. Likewise, when they make more money, we make more money through an effective increased monthly subscription cost. Our thesis is that by providing such loans, we give workers the financial tools to break out of cyclical poverty and increase their earning potential.\n\nWe want to prove this business model out in the financial services industry since it is one of the most entrenched and predatory industries out there for the working poor. If we can make this business model work in financial services, it is a much smaller leap into other markets.\n\nOur vision is a marketplace where the constituents of communities can offer up percentages of their future income in order to attract a specific service, and on which service providers can bid to buy up these contracts. Imagine if a poor community could offer 1% of their future income in return for a safe school system and educational providers bid on these ISA contracts to then build that school system for the community. Or if a hospital system can go to a community with a medical desert and offer to provide medical services in exchange for 5% of their future income for 20 years.\n\nThere is so much talent in America and around the world that is just waiting to be unlocked. We can’t rely on political systems to provide that anymore and private companies have no way to do so. Until now.

Group trauma can lead to distorted thinking, which often manifests as internalized oppression, as people try to maintain some sense of misplaced control over the circumstances of their oppression. In addition, trauma from long-stranding oppression can leave the group huddled together in a form of stagnated solidarity. When anyone tries to move beyond the place of suffering that the group has occupied, they are attacked by the group and brought back down (Mitchell 56).\n\nWhen layered a top a large population of people already traumatized from the long term impacts of climate crisis and the kleptocracy-capitalism hybrid many of us are navigating along with massive inequality and economic disruption, **it’s no wonder why massive portions of the population are clinging to disinformation that makes them feel empowered over their own lives.** It’s no wonder that identity politics have now reached full scale destruction.\n\n![Stop the Bans protest in Wilmington, NC 2019.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f_nOlArZpYK3BlHyXJ3pc.jpg?height=2000&width=3000)\n\nAs a society, **we’re succumbing to weaponized algorithms willingly as a means of escape** and as a way to feel a sense of solidarity by supporting conspiracies that restore a feeling of agency through a collective enemy that is responsible for the individual’s pain. Mass conspiracies thrive in such an environment of group trauma by providing a means of mutual belief and connection.\n\nAt a very young age, we are taught in western society to ignore our pain and muscle through. We’re taught that pain is weakness and that to feel and express emotions is not something that strong, independent people do. We’re taught that to survive in this world we must “pull ourselves up by our bootstraps” and suffer through whatever pain or trauma has been thrown at us over the span of our lifetimes. **We are taught to internalize the oppressor’s systems of control and blame ourselves for the inequalities baked into our societal fabrics.**\n\nAt a very young age we are taught to accept the means of oppression baked into our social structures and to never question the means or motives of the oppressor. **We accept the consumption based economy and the patriarchal laws as reality,** something we must accept and can not change or push back upon. We believe the narrative of war and destruction as a necessary reality to protect our existence on this planet.\n\n![Stop the Bans protest in Wilmington, NC 2019.   ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sQmhaxCa_-shlWhW_Zxmy.jpg?height=2000&width=3000)\n\nBut here we stand. Bound together by a collective trauma, unaware of the manifestation of pain from that trauma and trying to navigate a system designed to oppress all of us into the acceptance of consumption and destruction as inevitable.\n\nOur societal programming has brought us to a precipice of destruction and if we do not recognize, explore and **accept our individual pain and our neighbor’s pain as valid and help one another process this global experience**, we will never move past the destruction and step into healing.\n\nWhat if we chose to no longer participate in such oppression or weaponized algorithms? What if we all stop, look around and acknowledge the trauma? What if we all lean into those quiet moments of fear and explore the emotion that is behind the fear itself? What if we take a time out and just feel the impacts of losing 700k countrymen and millions of global citizens? **What if we unplug from the weaponized algorithms, go out into our communities and simply talk to one another?**\n\n> The courage to feel pain is something that most of us are never taught. Instead, we learn to distract ourselves from it, insulate, and deflect. The irony is that pain cannot be avoided. When we attempt to avoid our pain, it hunts us down, becoming increasingly stealthy in its machinations...It disrupts our lives, torments our minds, and destroys our relationships (Mitchell 65).\n\nWhat if we **turn to the wisdom of the indigenous peoples** and incorporate their methods of community and healing into our systems now? What if we made healing the planet AND our communities a top priority rather than continuing to destroy our home in the name of economic growth?\n\n![Stop the Bans protests in Wilmington, NC 2019. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uBL5VsMoE8Fez8whiFbbs.jpg?height=2000&width=3000)\n\nWhat if we embraced our pain and began a journey to healing? Are we even capable of such a thing? Can we turn to the wisdom of ancient tribal communities who lived harmoniously with nature on this planet and employ their approach of balancing the masculine and feminine to restore our ability to survive on this planet and navigate the collective trauma of our present and the coming chaos of our immediate future?\n\nI believe we’re rapidly moving past the question of “can we?” We are now facing the reality that “we must.”\n\n**We must process our collective trauma. We must hold space for our communities to heal. We must embrace sacred wisdom. We must balance the masculine with the feminine so our planet can heal. And survive.**\n\n*Work Cited*\n\nMitchell, Sherri L, and Larry Dossey. *Sacred Instructions : Sacred Instructions : Indigenous Wisdom for Living Spirit-Based Change / Indigenous Wisdom for Living Spirit-Based Change*.

邀请码2018936491）\n\n\\*\\*FTX：\\*\\*顶级交易员创办的专业交易所，深度超大，功能很强，势头十分强劲，甚至有人认为平台币FTT会超越BNB，区块链世界发展很快，或许一切皆有可能。（网址:<https://ftx.com/> 邀请码[BTCdayu](https://ftx.com/#a=btcdayu) ）\n\n上述交易所均可以使用国内身份KYC，注册和登录时可能需要翻墙。\n\n以币安为例，详细注册方法如下。\n\n\\*\\*第一步，\\*\\*打开翻墙软件，比如Astrill.com等，自己选择比如台湾、瑞典的服务器登录（不可使用美国、中国、日本、新加坡、韩国等国家，因为交易所不允许这些国家用户访问）。\n\n**第二步，访问币安[www.binance.com](https://www.binance.com/zh-CN)  (点击右上角english可切换中文)，进去后会问你居住国家，你可以随便选，我的话选中国即可，然后使用上面我们注册好的GOOGLE邮箱注册，务必记得点击推荐人ID那里，填上我的邀请码**RWIMTPK2，否则注册完**你将失去**这**20%优惠**的机会！\n\n已经有币安帐户，但没有20%优惠的可以参照下面的提示操作。3分钟重新注册即可。，访问<https://www.binance.com/zh-CN/my/risk/delete-account-appeal>   （此网址仍然需要翻墙工具）可以注销，注销前须将资产提走，小额资产比较多的可以一键全部换为BNB。\n\n\\*\\*PS2：注册领取福利。\\*\\*注册后电报私聊我，可以加入电报的“大宇核心群”，我会给出很多重要的交易和币圈资讯，很多时候能早收到，目前核心群还在试运行中，很多内容都免费到各社群，比如我的[万人电报交流大群https://t.me/dayu222](https://t.me/dayu222)\n\n千万不要小看这个福利哦，我在公开频道的发言有心人可以去回看，节奏很不错哦：\n\n519前大陆第一个提示风险，并带领群友清仓的应该就是我了。\n\n比特币30000时提示无论如何都要进场第一批，43000时提示加仓，58000提示最后加仓一次。\n\nDYDX 10U和FODL 0.55U时提示进场，在这些节奏中，你会明白为什么我笃定下半场牛市我会财富自由。\n\n**5.怎么加入大宇电报群**\n\n电报安装有两种方式：\n\n第一种是安装第三方电报。比如币用、海螺等，这些软件都已经内置了第三方代理，用户只需要正常安装APP就能访问了，非常方便，大多数新手直接用这种，缺点是有时访问慢，而且功能较少。我个人不喜欢用这种。而且据群友反馈，这种方式因为其实其原理是内置了FQ，很容易被监测到，有网友被JC找上门要求删除这个APP。\n\n第二种是官方电报安装，我用的是这种。优点是简洁、省心、安全。但不足的是必须用到翻墙工具，否则是无法注册和访问的，实际上以后混币圈梯子是必备的，这种方式如果用一个好的工具，非常舒服，像我前面说的软件有智能模式，手机可以一直开着，国内的自动用原本流量，国外的自动切换国外的流量，推荐这种。\n\n**第一种方式，用别的软件进电报**\n\n直接复制下方网址到浏览器中\n\n[https://0.plus/dayu222](https://0.plus/dayu222)\n\n第一次访问会提示你安装BTOK APP，第二次再点就可以入群了。\n\n个别同学出现的提示说只能双向聊天之类，这主要是对中国手机号码的限制，可以点此阅读“[教程](https://www.mosq.cn/post-585.html)”解决。\n\n注意，我同步开通了电报的广播频道，类似于微信禁言群，但比禁言群高级：一是可以回看我的所有重要信息，二是还可以对我的信息进行评论。\n\n进禁言频道链接：**[0.puls/btcdayu2](http://0.puls/btcdayu2)**\n\n**第二种、翻墙后使用官方电报（推荐）**\n\n如果你是高阶用户，想体验原版电报，可以参考如下教程：\n\n第一步，翻墙，参照本文第一部分内容。\n\n第二步，访问电报官网，下载需要的客户端，我一般习惯用WINDOWS电脑使用，手机版也可以同样下载。\n\n[https://telegram.org/](https://telegram.org/)\n\n第三步，翻译电报。\n\n电报安装好之后是英文的，使用上多有不便，如果需要使用中文，则可以直接将下面链接复制到电报的聊天框——任何频道、任何人的聊天框均可，然后点击此链接即变换为纯中文：\n\ntg://setlanguage?lang=zhcncc\n\n如果无效，直接在搜索栏输入@zh_cn 按提示操作即可。\n\n官方电报进群，可以直接在浏览器打开以下网址，会自动切换到电报进群：\n\n[https://t.me/dayu222  （交流群）](https://t.me/dayu222)\n\n[https://t.me/BTCdayu2（禁言群）](https://t.me/BTCdayu999)\n\n[https://t.me/dayu999  （矿业群）](https://t.me/BTCdayu999)\n\n从目前的体验来看，电报真的很好用，支持20万人的大群（不用担心群消息杂乱，我可以设置大家的发言频率，比如10分钟甚至1小时，这样能确保大家都进行高质量的发言，反而不再会出现微信群中乱刷图片的现象。）\n\n朋友们，一起加入吧，开启新的星辰大海！\n\n另外，我也正在研究Discord频道的使用，因为此频道必须翻墙，所以此前没有推广，但比电报会更强大，包括只有邀请才能进入，广告几乎没有，可以分为不同频道，包括下载频道，禁言频道等等，等大家普遍翻墙了，Discord会是首选——大多数项目方NFT空投全都需要这个。\n\n已经有的，可直接访问：<https://discord.com/invite/x6x9mqepxw>\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yiWvIwnUw81F5KA6l2yt7.png?height=1112&width=965)\n\n",

What started with the housing bubble of 2008, continued with bank bailouts, quantitative easing, data breaches from major financial institutions, corporate fraud in Silicon Valley, distrust of mass media, political unrest, distrust of large tech companies from both sides of the political spectrum, government surveillance states, increasing inequality, absurd college costs, and a deep cynicism about the future. \n\nWhile I don’t particularly agree with the cause of outrage against all of these issues, it’s clearly empathizable. Outside of the white collar elite bubble, the socioeconomic systems in the US seems to be breaking. \n\nSystemic change is meant to happen. Besides what your economic 101 class in highschool led you to believe, systems are not meant to approach equilibrium and stay in a static state for the rest of time. Such a train of thought is appealing to the Marxist and Malthusian, but not indicative of reality. \n\nIt is incredibly important for participants in a system to recognize when it is not serving the majority of people, and for the unserved to seek reform.  Within the immensely webbed mesh of private and public institutions, this essay will cover the three most fundamental and explore how they have begun to fail and what change may look like for them. \n\n**Money**\n\n> Interest Rate: 1.75%\n>\n> Inflation Rate: 1.8%\n>\n> GDP Growth Rate: 2.3%\n>\n> Nasdaq YTD: 27%\n\nThe purpose of these statistics is to illustrate an economy in which wealth is being redistributed from the savings of the middle and lower classes to the wealthy, often coastal, financial asset owners. The monetary story of the past decade is essentially the Federal Reserve buying junk assets off the balance sheets of big banks and keeping interest rates incredibly low in a desperate attempt to encourage them to lend and invest in order to push economic activity up. Investment managers are now so flooded with cash that they are literally willing to give money with the expectation that they get the same amount, or less, back. Sound crazy? Five central banks around the world now have negative interest rates.\n\nTheoretically, cheap money should encourage economic investment and spending that increases GDP, but money is now chasing financial assets instead of capital ones. For example, major corporations are using access to cheap debt to buyback their own stock and raise the stock price instead of putting more money to work in terms of capital expenditures or investing in new projects. Why aren’t companies investing in their cash? Perhaps they don’t have any new ideas. Or perhaps they know that the economy isn’t all that strong and over investment in business lines or capital assets is going to bite them in the ass when this entire bubble bursts. Consider the radical asymmetry displayed in the chart below:\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49522afc-2f52-458d-aba7-f0704c67b49b\\_1200x828.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49522afc-2f52-458d-aba7-f0704c67b49b\\_1200x828.jpeg)\n\nWhat’s the consequence of this? Those that hold financial assets are seeing their values get pumped up by all this free cash going around, and those that don’t are experiencing low wage growth and an eventual tax against their savings once all this free money printing catches up. Redistribution of wealth from the have nots to the haves. This isn’t a capitalist or anti-capitalist economic critique as all five of the current central banks that have negative interest rates are in “democratic socialist” countries. It’s a currency governance problem. There is a paradigm shift coming. \n\nCountries can not keep a monopoly on currency. In a story so poetic that it almost reads like Neal Stephenson, a hedge against the traditional financial system was born out of the 2008 financial crisis and reckless monetary policy. Bitcoin. It was started by an anonymous developer, or a group of developers, grown and maintained by a fanatical group of early adopters with a die hard belief in software’s belief to bring upon self sovereignty - reminiscent of strong cypherpunk philosophies.\n\nYou may criticize Bitcoin’s price volatility, it’s over zealous fan base, or its ostensible complexity, but the aforementioned system would not be possible on a Bitcoin standard. To those unfamiliar with how Bitcoin works, just understand that control over it is decentralized among all network participants, and transactions through it cannot be censored. This is huge. \n\nAs a prerequisite for a free society, you need the ability to freely exchange monetary value with whoever you want. Historically, physical cash has served this purpose, but when currency becomes increasingly digital and banks operate as de facto government franchises, the government has the power to control:\n\n1.  if you can access your money, \n2.  how you access your money, \n3.  and to whom you are allowed to send your money to. \n\nSkeptics may look at China’s iron control over money flow, or here in the US, with payment processors blocking transactions to porn sites and cam girls.\n\nThings get more interesting with the launch of Ethereum. Whereas Bitcoin constituted a monetary platform built on top of the blockchain, Ethereum aimed to build a generaziable computation platform. That means that you can get software to exist and compute independent of one centralized body and uncensorable to any coercive regime. Software that exists and runs autonomously.\n\nIn a previous [essay](https://puniaviision.substack.com/p/on-a-blockchain-investment-thesis-1fc51d02674?r=5naz\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&utm_source=copy) on my blockchain investment thesis, I mention how most strong blockchain projects need to have a moral principle defining their reason to exist. Today, the big, intriguing disruptive trend in this space is around decentralized finance. Decentralized finance covers interesting new financial primitives built on top of Ethereum that anybody can create and innovate on, and nobody can own. Anybody who has built anything in Fintech could tell you how much of a pain in the ass is it is to build any innovation in such a tightly controlled, regulated space. But with decentralized finance, innovation is permissionless. You can build new types of derivative contracts, exotic markets of anything, new insurance models, global savings accounts, programmable interest rates, and even an autonomously functioning decentralized Federal Reserve!\n\nRight now, innovation in decentralized finance hasn’t really created anything strictly *new*. But when we look to history, in the early days of the Internet, websites were digitized magazines, and Mark Cuban became a billionaire by putting the radio on the internet. Similarly, the early days of TV consisted solely of somebody looking into the camera and just talking. It’s hard to conceive what is possible when innovation blossoms over new platforms. Before the internet, the distribution of information occurred through tightly controlled systems of broadcast television or printing houses. By freeing this system, the way we publish and share information has been changed forever. It will be interesting to see this effect taken to finance. \n\nNow I don’t think Bitcoin will be replacing all currency, nor will Ethereum be replacing all software. Countries don’t exist in vacuums and a national currency is a powerful geopolitical tool. But it needs competition. A hedge. Our current financial system is not well fit for the modern economy and over the next decade it will be interesting to see how it changes. Those interested must keep an eye on decentralized money and finance. \n\n**Governance**\n\nDoes democracy scale? When you have at most two choices for the leader to run a nation of 330M, seemingly curated by those with money and media, and no matter who ends up winning, half the nation cries outrage and conspiracy - you can’t help but question the governance structures of our democracy. Our country has faced division in the past, but the consolidation of power by the Federal government has centralized it in DC. The American constitution is an amazing amalgamation of moral philosophy and game theory that has served us incredibly well since the birth of our nation. But even given the astounding prescience of our founding fathers, it could never have predicted the interconnectedness and technological advancement of the modern era. \n\nIt is not uncommon for people to call for the dismissal of the electoral college, restriction of free speech (even outside of social media), the abolishment of the second amendment, and for those that disagree, they disagree so vehemently as to label the opposition as criminals accuse the other side of treason. We aren’t listening to each other anymore. \n\nWho really has any idea of what is going on in DC? Why does nobody besides grumpy old people give a shit about what happens at the local governance level? The one where we can make the most difference. How does every president, congress member, or regulatory enforcer, get stupidly rich after serving their term? Is “public servant” a misnomer? Why does our government, the same government that shocked the world with our Apollo program, now incapable of launching a healthcare website? \n\nWhile I don’t think there is anything inherent to democracy to prevent it from functioning properly at scale, I do think the way power is distributed in a democracy is a question worth deeply exploring. If half the nation feels like the man or woman up top is going to destroy our future, perhaps it’s the case that the person up top wields far too much power. In the blackbox of Washington DC, lightly illuminated by C-SPAN, accountability to the electorate breaks down and the seeds of corruption begin to sprout. \n\nWhat we tried to do at my last company, Heroic, is to provide a way for communities to form and self govern around issues that impact them best. We thought the best way to do it was by making people investable and thus circumventing the problem of asking people to pay for public goods. Our execution was lacking, it is an idea that is close to my heart. While we get lost in the moralistic, dramatic, toxic, zero-sum political games that happen at the national level for which we understand very little, we miss out on participating in everything that is happening right around us. \n\nThe key to the future of governance is enabling experiments to happen at the local scale between people that roughly know each other and have some level of accountability with each other. Because bodies with power are rarely willing to give it up, and violent revolution mutually agreed upon as an unsavory outcome,  such experiments in governance are going to be enabled by private companies using technology to change the way in which we interact and provide value to one another. Perhaps such emergent self governance will happen in the physical world as Heroic aimed to do, but perhaps it could also get a little digital. \n\nEnter gaming. Consider the once popular game Second Life:\n\n*“Second Life is an online world in which residents create virtual representations of themselves, called avatars, and interact with other avatars, places or objects. Second Life isn't just a fancy chat room -- residents can do much more than communicate with one another. For one thing, they can contribute to the world around them, creating buildings, objects or even animations. Resident additions to the virtual world are called user-generated content, and this content is one of the factors that makes Second Life such a unique online environment. *\n\n*In Second Life, residents can go to social gatherings, live concerts, press conferences and even college classes. They can do a lot of things you can do in real life -- buy land, shop for clothes and gadgets or just visit with friends. They can also do things that are impossible in the real world -- avatars can fly or teleport to almost any location. Some residents design short programs, called scripts, which give avatars or objects new abilities, including special animations or the ability to generate copies of other objects.”*\n\nThis literally feels like a second, digital world, structured and organized by code instead of violently enforced law. What is even more shocking is that this digital world was estimated to have a total GDP of $500 ***Million*** in 2015. People had virtual jobs in this virtual economy that they were getting paid to do with non-virtual cash.\n\nEven now, we have these massive, sandbox virtual worlds like Minecraft that users devote weeks of their time to build experiences on top of for nothing else but the artistic and hobbystic value of doing so. A promising aspect of blockchain technology is the ability to create provable scarcity of virtual assets that is now being deeply explored as a way for gamers to monetize their commitment to their craft. As people get more and more engorged into these digital realms that carry the same emotional importance as physical ones, governance is going to become more and more of a pertinent question. Already different gaming clans have their devoted websites, forum pages, chat groups, and meetups within which they organize their communities. \n\nNew voting structures like quadratic voting, governance experiments like futarchy, organizational structures like decentralized autonomous organizations, are ideas that are hard to implement in the rigid world of atoms, but incredibly accessible in the fluid world of bits. Gaming is going to transform from a recreational pastime, to the digital Renaissance Rome of societal structure. \n\nWhile radical ideas for the governance of the future will be tested in digital realms, there needs to be a tie in to the physical world. Massive opportunity exists for private companies willing to take on the gargantuan task of providing a digital interface within which we govern our own communities and interact with the ambient political system around us. What is currently being voted on in DC? How has this candidate voted in the past? Who donates the most amount of money to this candidate? Who are government contracts being given out to? How can I inform my representative how I would like them to vote? How can I pay for my parking ticket, renew my drivers license, and transfer my home title all online? The end state would look similar to competitive, extra-legal bodies, with their own capital and talent pool allocated through different governance structures and providing public-esque services. Citizenship-as-a-service. \n\nSome countries like Estonia have already taken major steps into digitizing their government services. Others will follow. In the coming decade governance and govtech will be incredibly important problems to solve. \n\n**Social Media**\n\nIn a lot of ways social media is the preeminent relationship we have with the internet. If you had to divy the time you spent on the internet, it would be a fair bet that the vast majority of it is spent digesting and sharing information discovered on social media. Whether it be LinkedIn to manage your professional sphere, Twitter to hear pundits pontificate, Instagram to feel insecure, or Reddit to waste time. What started of as an innocuous attempt at entertainment, soon became the defining use-case of the internet. \n\nInnocent beginnings or not, social media is now anything but that. It calls into question not only our emotional health in the digital age, but also the health of our own democracy. Demonized like the hero that lived long enough to become the villain, algorithms that govern addiction now govern belief systems and exist secretly in their stoic intricacies behind by the Neverland facade of Silicon Valley tech companies. There are three primary ways in which I see the social media story playing out in the next decade\n\n1.  Breaking down the closed source, monopolistic reach of social networks\n2.  Narrow social networks\n3.  Pseudonymous networks\n\nStarting with the first point. Perhaps recommendation algorithms wouldn’t be viewed as so Machiavellan if we could actually understand how they worked and audit them for biases. Sacrificing the proprietary nature of the algorithm for the trust of the user. A trade that will most definitely not happen unless enforced by government. One weak way this would work is open sourcing the code for the recommendation algorithms, and promising that code to be the one that the company itself is running on its own servers. Like what Gab does, and also like Gab, not very reassuring. An alternative strong way this could work is by having information algorithms exist as unalterable and uncensorable smart contracts verifiable on the blockchain - provably executing in the fashion intended. \n\nIf this path is not taken, and social media platforms are still able to harness more reach and attention in their closed loop systems, politicians will take action. In no world will they allow the oracles of elections to be companies that exist unregulated. We see this line of thought already inching to the foreground of political dialogue with Elizabeth Warren calling for the breakup of big tech and Republican pundits decrying conservative thought censorship by tech companies existing in impenetrable liberal bastions. \n\nOn to number two. “Hello, World” is probably the first piece of code you learn to program in any intro to computer science course, and as a whole is emblematic of the first age of the internet. The desire to broadcast your thoughts to the whole world that was eventually productized by Facebook, Twitter, and other social media conglomerates. Now we feel the hangover of toxic interconnected exuberance. Whether it is trolls, to accusations of election manipulation, to toxic tribalistic groups eschewing real dialogue, more of us are retreating into more intimate social structures where communication and expression of thought are still greatly enabled by technology.\n\nI find Reddit to incredibly fascinating and underrated, for one key reason: subreddits. For those that don’t know, subreddits follow the same UI and UX as normal Reddit but are focused around curation and conversation of interest based topics. There exists subreddits for cyclists, audiophiles, economists, and The Office enthusiasts. What's so magical about subreddits is their ability to bring together specifically passionate people from all around the world and provide them an environment to collaborate, curate, and create. Because the community is much smaller than a traditional social network would be, those that invest time in the subreddit community are often recognized by the regulars and allowed to accrue social status. It is so much more positive sum than Facebook could ever be. This exists in the digital world, but entrepreneurs are actively working on the task of bridging it to the physical and providing a clean interface for positive connection to occur between both. \n\nFinally we get to the topic of pseudonymity. A strange topic to be considering as a key aspect of the future because it was the first digital primitive of the past. When the web launched into infancy, defacto online chat rooms and message boards consisted of pseudonymous usernames communicating in a principally unmoderated fashion. Perhaps it was the longing for intimacy and an anthropomorphization of digital identity that caused an exodus from these early internet structures and towards networks representing real identities and people. Whatever the case, they took over. While Reddit still preserves the pseudonymity aspect, most other networks like Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok, and Twitter are based around real people.\n\nAt least that has been true until now. Among the newer wave of social media participants, we see an increasing desire to go back to a divorce of digital identity and real identity. Be it through anonymous theme based Twitter profiles, virtual character based Instagram accounts, or even online games that use pseudonymous identity around shared experiences to cultivate social connections. Another reason for this trend could be the explosion of cancel culture, where not only the expression of the slightest socially unapproved belief could cause viral castigation and harm someone's career trajectory, but the very evidence of it ever occurring throughout your entire internet history is enough to destroy you. It’s virtue signaling hysteria. People don’t want such risk in their physical, personal, and professional life. \n\nThere are infinite ways and permutations by which entrepreneurs may take the trends expressed above to create social media networks of the future. Who knows  if the precise future is gaming like Andreessen Horowitz claim, or if it is further decreasing the barriers to creation like Tik Tok is enabling, but no matter the medium of expression used, the channels to build such will do so on the emotional and human principles described above. The next big wave of social media will look more like a subreddit, and less like a timeline. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis essay isn’t to say that radical technological improvements in artificial intelligence, robotics, pharmacology, transportation, and biology won’t massively affect our society in the next decade. There are some fascinating innovations happening in each of the above that have the potential to axiomatically reshape humanity. However, the lack of the above is only an ancillary reason why the institutions upon which we depend on today are failing. Self driving cars won’t solve governance, faster commercial ships won’t change the way by which we interact with each other, and new drugs won’t solve the issue of storing and transmitting value. \n\nAs a lover of humans, societies, and structures, I find money, governance, and social to be among the most basic building blocks of humanity. It is such institutions that encourage technological and cultural innovations in the first place and making them work for everybody is key to keeping society cohesive.\n\nWhile these issues are great and in some way require changing the way we interact with government, perhaps the most depressing, yet critical, of all institutions mentioned above, I am incredibly optimistic. I love that more and more people are waking up to the order around them and asking some of the most fundamental questions about humanity and society. Even if it has sowed hatred and division among different tribes, human ingenuity will overcome. Our new institutions will unlock human potential and enable us to once again do what we didn’t think possible. \n\nIf you like my writing and would like to be kept up to date with more, I’m starting a newsletter and eventually a website where you can subscribe to!

The little I do write ends up being half baked thoughts that I throw away. I wonder why that is because I really do enjoy writing and I love the responses I get from people, but for some reason I still struggle to make a habit out of it. I’m hoping it’s simply a byproduct of the natural chaos that has been going on in my life, and now is probably going on in everyone’s life.\n\nOver the past few months I’ve been launching new products, one publicly, one not so. I started a social service called Zest which I was quite public about on Facebook and Product hunt, and we were able to get a few meetups going which was an awesome experience. I hoped the few that experienced them enjoyed it and it's technically the first revenue I’ve been able to generate from a startup (besides the OG tutoring company Aaron, Alex, and I started in highschool). I linked up with a technical cofounder and we got to work on it but quite quickly through iterating discovered why the model is a massive uphill battle.\n\nFor starters, being able to match 5 people up on their personal or professional interests required a significant sign up density. One solution you could do to work around is to really narrow down the scope of the match making you’re doing, like only match making people interested in crypto, such that anybody who signs up is a good fit for everybody else. We launched three side campaigns for that: meditation, dance, and fitness with some cheap Instagram ads. Cool traction! The second layer problem was trying to find meeting spaces that would be affordable and comfortable to the people signing up. That was actually pretty hard but we boot strapped by using our friend’s places and public spots. The real straw that broke the camel’s back was that through user interviews, we discovered most people see themselves using a service like Zest once a month max. That's pretty killer for a social tech company. Also since there’s no barrier to entry, literally every entrepreneur and their mother was trying to build something like Zest. We moved on and if we hadn’t corona would have probably killed us lol. \n\nThe second product which we did not publicly announce was an online fitness trainer marketplace called Cusp. This is probably the closest I’ve gotten to an actual business. My cofounder realized that a lot of online personal trainers advertise and get clients on Instagram, and have no way to manage their backend. We reached out to online trainers by DM’ing hundreds on Instagram and got 40 coaches to join. Of course there was a lot of competition from other online-native gyms, but we figured there would be a good enough niche for coaches who wanted to preserve their own brand and for people who wanted to discover their coaches by exploring their content. \n\nAt this point though I was getting pretty burnt out. I’d spent 6 months grinding with no pay, social sacrifice, and dwindling passion for the things I was working on after Heroic. The road ahead for Cusp was long and we didn’t really want to fundraise until we were sure this is something that had traction and that we were willing to work on it for the foreseeable future. \n\nSo about three weeks ago I stepped off the founder journey to find a job at a startup, have some stability, and work on projects like Cusp on the side. Of course about two weeks ago shit really hit the fan when it came to the economy and everything went tumbling down so my timing was comically poor. Luckily I’d saved a decent amount of money from college and my time at Draper so I’m in no real financial risk, but I find it genuinely funny how unexpected life can be. \n\nRecruiting has been pretty brutal. I thought graduating from a good school and getting a rare job out of college at a top VC fund under a legendary investor would make it a cake walk, but my background seems to be too weird for big companies and not specific enough for startups in this market. It’s alright though, just means it's going to take more work and time then I thought. If anybody has any leads, do shoot them over!\n\nAfter the chaotic journey of the past 7 months or so, I’ve had a lot of varied experiences and time to reflect. I don’t think I would function as a traditional business in the sense that I don’t naturally enjoy the sport of business. I would be a bad founder of a business that I didn’t think was important or innovative - in such a case I would much rather be an early employee. What I do romanticize a lot is innovation and nothing has really gripped me much since Heroic. I’m going to take a shot at that business again - I just wasn’t ready this time. \n\nThe other thing that's been tough, and that not many people seem to be writing about on these newsletters, is relationships.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87bb61ed-6b00-4e98-b051-fc2e8e96acec\\_1139x876.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87bb61ed-6b00-4e98-b051-fc2e8e96acec\\_1139x876.jpeg)\n\nI’m 23 now and it’s this anxiously weird state where most of my friends being in committed relationships, a few single, and some even being married! For the first time in my life, I feel super strange about being single. \n\nI’ve never really had anything close to a serious relationship in my life. I don’t even think I really get how that whole thing works. Like you just go on a few dates with someone and then a flip switches and you’re monogamously boyfriend/girlfriend? That sounds weird man. How do you know? How do you choose? How long do you date? What changes after? \n\nIt's something everyone else seems to intuitively grasp and figure out, but I haven’t yet. I don’t think it’s something I internally feel a drive for, but externally it's hard not to feel left out and want to explore this other aspect of living as a human. Dating apps suck, my friends are useless, and none of my hookups have really amounted to any level of intimate follow up. In my whole life, there’s probably been only one girl I’ve ever really seriously liked  who I met at a party I hosted. I tried to make something happen there, but nothing did and now it's in the past. I do hope to experience it again someday.\n\nEven the whole act of one night stands have lost their excitement and honestly aren’t that fun anymore. Not super stoked about sharing a bed with a stranger. Followed up by awkward small talk after trying to gauge if the other person is even awake. Spooning is nice though.\n\nRelationships as a whole are changing. Not just romantic ones, but the ones that we have with our friends and parents. The boyz are now getting older, have their own interests, their own significant others, and as a unit seem to be getting less...boyz. Not that it's a bad thing, it's likely profoundly good and imparting a lot of meaning to their lives, but it is a structural relationship change. Where do we fit now in each other's lives? What are the new boundaries? What is reasonable to expect from each other? How do we deal with and navigate each others’ flaws?\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9566c997-42eb-4caf-ac46-d763319cb57d\\_600x189.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9566c997-42eb-4caf-ac46-d763319cb57d\\_600x189.jpeg)\n\n\\\nRelationship types like coworkers, bosses, and mentors are totally new, at least for me, and interesting to explore. I was lucky to find a mentor in my old boss at the VC firm and it's cool to have someone with experience provide you advice. But I don’t quite understand the boundaries there either.\n\nThis is a lot and maybe I’ll spend more blog posts in the future delving into some of the specific questions posed above. \n\nThe final note that I want to end this post with is an understanding of the type of life I want to live. I’ve realized that I crave a romantic life. This might seem paradoxical as I just said above I don’t understand relationships, but it is something I hope to! Eventually I guess. I don’t want power or influence, what I crave is love, passion, art, and freedom. An almost bohemian-esque lifestyle filled with those things and people with whom I can share it with. I’ve been reading Philip Glass’ biography recently and am struck by the level of clarity he had and things he’s been able to do - it makes me feel a little less naive.\n\nEven though the past 7 months have straight been chock full of Ls, I haven’t quite lost my romantic idealism yet. I want to explore the ideas of romance in people, in work, in life, and in art in future blog posts.\n\nInspired by Tiny Beautiful Things: Advice on Love and Life from Dear Sugar, a fantastic book on hope, I want to open up my blog for other people’s stories as well. If something I’ve written resonates with you and you have something to say, please use this [form](https://forms.gle/VpNRneBJKLGDHZAr8) to let me know what it is and, if appropriate, I will share in my next blog post. I want to interact with people that read this and see how they feel. \n\nYou may have noticed the tone of this blog is a lot more casual than the other ones. I’m probably going to vacillate between more formal, analytical pieces on economics and startups, along with more emotional, casual pieces. \n\nThank you for reading!

{"id": "ibUU92an_KiYneOQHJ3N-zIOfqTAx1JnjBM4ISOi-Xg", "title": "On a Blockchain Investment Thesis", "body": "Blockchain is trending. It’s almost shocking to see its tremendous growth in popularity as someone who first joined the space when it was exclusively known as the way for college students to buy drugs off the internet. Now it has about a half a trillion dollar market cap (although this will probably be outdated by the time you read this).\n\nExperts and investors are touting it as the solution to everything, and also nothing; something that will change the world, but also something that will wipe out trillions of dollars of wealth. So how do value investors form a coherent thesis about a technology surrounded by so much hype, ill-informed opinions, market movements, and a fear of missing out on potentially the next big thing? Calling the blockchain “internet 3.0” is vacuous, as is calling it “the next big thing since the internet” — ask anyone who makes these claims about what those words actually mean and you will hear an awkward smattering of more buzzwords.\n\nYou can find several articles about how the blockchain works and a plethora of use cases, so what I really want to do here is guide investors through the philosophy underlying this phenomenon, create an intuition around why it is important, and my own investment thesis.\n\n![Source: https://www.coindesk.com/dilbert-comic-strips-lampoon-blockchain-and-initial-coin-offerings/](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cea99df-06c0-4a09-9077-41f8860c405a_597x181.jpeg)\n\nFor those truly seeking to understand the history of blockchain and the motivation behind the initial pioneers, one must look towards the cypherpunk movement of the late 1980’s and 1990’s. Nothing summarizes better the ethos of that movement than the [Cypherpunk Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html), written in 1993 by Eric Hughes, an alumni of my very own University of California, Berkeley. (I always thought it incredibly fitting that U.C. Berkeley was, and continues to be, the vanguard of social revolution and is home to the leading college blockchain organization in the world.) I would highly recommend anyone who wants to potentially devote their career to this space to read the manifesto to see if they are actually passionate about blockchain’s mission. I found the most powerful excerpt to be:\n\n*“We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence. It is to their advantage to speak of us, and we should expect that they will speak. To try to prevent their speech is to fight against the realities of information. Information does not just want to be free, it longs to be free. Information expands to fill the available storage space. Information is Rumor’s younger, stronger cousin; Information is fleeter of foot, has more eyes, knows more, and understands less than Rumor.*\n\n*We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any. We must come together and create systems which allow anonymous transactions to take place. People have been defending their own privacy for centuries with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret handshakes, and couriers. The technologies of the past did not allow for strong privacy, but electronic technologies do. We the Cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems. We are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic money.”*\n\nWell, what does that mean? Even though blockchain technology in its contemporary form is encompassing much more than the original manifesto, it illustrates that blockchain is not just a technology. Anyone evangelizing blockchain as a platform is missing the entire point — it is inherently a social movement. It’s value is built upon societal adoption of a “protocol” without any one single person able to alter it without the network’s approval. It is owned by the people in an unprecedented way. That is all very abstract, so to really understand the difference, let me compare it to other “trending” technologies — like AI.\n\nMy friends and I have always been deeply interested in figuring out which technologies we thought would push humanity forward, so when I decided to devote my future to this industry and its mission, I was naturally questioned about how it could possibly be more important than other frontier technologies like AI and gene editing. I had a tough time answering that question, until I realized the question itself is fundamentally misleading. Trying to compare blockchain with AI in terms of societal impact is like trying to compare democracy with the steam engine. One is a shift in a cultural paradigm upon which a society is organized, whereas the other is a change in what a society is even capable of doing. Different, somewhat parallel, frames of thought — none particularly more important than the other.\n\nWhen we talk about progress, especially here in Silicon Valley, we myopically look only towards technological progress, and ignore the cultural. Technological progress is great in that it raises the standard of living for everyone and is able to help us, as a species, control our fate; however cultural progress is that which makes humanity more than solely a resource aggregating machine. It adds meaning, morality, love, and justice. It changes how we view one another, and how we experience life. Humanity has been through several Industrial and Technological revolutions, but now it is time for the next Renaissance.\n\n![The School of Athens — the intense humanity and emotion expressed in Renaissance art](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b2a38c1-390c-4378-96d8-fa584856cfa3_730x486.jpeg)\n\nSo how does this tie into blockchain companies? Decentralized projects are a bit like pieces of art — their value determined by the market, their impact by societal acceptance, and their meaning never entirely alterable by the artist themselves.\n\nBefore you dismiss blockchain as a hippie art project, understand that art is only an incomplete analogy — just like the steam engine and printing press analogies are only barely able to capture what the impact of the internet has been. However, I found it a useful one when crafting my thesis. At the current maturity of blockchain technology, it is like economic art.\n\nConsider the ICO model. While it has been abused, it is incredible to think about a future where early believers of a technology actually benefit proportionally from its success in the form of token appreciation. Look towards breakthrough startups such as Uber and Airbnb — all of them relied on the faith of early adopters, yet the rewards of their success were incredibly skewed towards the equity holders. Of course the users definitely captured some economic value through their platforms, but ICOs present an opportunity to more equitably distribute rewards to early believers. To tie it back with the previous point, this is a fundamental restructuring of the economics of our society. Capitalism 2.0. Now that is powerful in ways vastly different than any other technological phenomenon today, and is what I love so much about it.\n\nNow, onto my investment thesis, most likely the reason why anyone is reading this post. It is guided primarily by projects whose existence are defined by a moral obligation, as opposed to specifically a technological necessity. Not to say those two are mutually exclusive, in fact they are most often intertwined, but a moral compulsion is what will drive the most successful and long lasting blockchain projects, just like how it was the reason why cypherpunks launched this movement in the first place. Sure, maybe blockchain could help with supply chain management, but that is a weak use case. On the other hand, blockchain being used to define a mechanism of value storage and exchange, like Bitcoin, that is free from the manipulation of potentially misguided entities, is powerful. It is incredibly unjust that individuals in developing countries, like Argentina, who have spent countless years working hard for their families and representing the fruits of their labor in a currency that the government promised would have value, had to see it go to nothing. Sometimes go to nothing multiple times in their life. This is why cryptocurrencies are becoming more and more popular in terms of actual usage in third-world, developing nations, where they cannot so freely trust the economic system like we can in the U.S.\n\nThis is not to admonish those governments as evil, or to say that our own is infallible, but rather to make it a point that coercive human institutions are prone to error, and often that error can have catastrophic ramifications on real people and their families. That is the power of blockchain — to make such institutions unnecessary. The greatest disintermediary. Skeptics may argue that the volatility of cryptocurrencies is evidence that cryptocurrencies are hardly a solution, but that is only due to the transitory period of the technology before it becomes mainstream. No one believed Mr. Tim Draper when he made the claim that Bitcoin will rise in value to $10,000 by the end of 2017, but look at what happened. The market cap of cryptocurrencies is about half a trillion, which is tiny compared to other comparable asset classes, but when it does mature, we can expect significantly more stable prices, and cryptocurrencies adopted as a dependable mechanism of value storage and exchange on par with fiat currencies. Eventually, people will make the decision that they trust algorithmic technologies more than human institutions.\n\n![Hyperinflation in Germany during the Weimar Republic](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89f9a2b9-5339-4343-a281-af211d5b9ab5_1000x618.jpeg)\n\nTo continue onto applications of my thesis, it is also immoral that my family, among others, has to worry about the government of India not enforcing the property rights entitling us ownership of our own land, by displaying fake deeds and re-written histories. Thus making land titles on the blockchain, which provide an unalterable history of ownership, powerful. It is immoral that gigantic data centers accumulate unfathomable amounts of data about our daily lives without us knowing, and then turn around and give that data away to veiled organizations destroying any privacy we think we may have. That is what makes self sovereignty of our identity and data through distributed systems so societally transformative. This is just to illustrate the few most palpable examples and the necessity of looking towards projects that have a real moral *raison d’être* behind them when considering an investment. Those, and infrastructure level projects that make blockchain technologies more mature and usable — be it through privacy, scalability, identity, or governance. These are the most likely to survive the in-coming market correction.\n\nI hope that communicates the core principle of how to value invest in blockchain technology, and how it is so fundamentally different than other trends. It is so much more than just a technology. We have a cultural phenomenon driving the Renaissance of the future, entirely owned by the people, and that is something to be excited for. Many believe things like the ICO will replace venture capital firms, but that is not the case. Presently, ICOs have been able to raise an incredible amount of money through the sheer hype around them caused by a few people making extravagant amounts of wealth, but it is hardly a trend that will last at the scale it has been so far. The role of the venture capitalist interested in creating value in the blockchain space will change, but will not be eliminated. That, however, is a post for another time.\n\n—\n\nFollow me on [Medium](https://medium.com/@apunia), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishek-punia-6b067a68/), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ThisIsPunia) if you are interested in understanding the core ethos behind the blockchain, or if want to learn how to invest in blockchain projects from a VC perspective.", "timestamp": 1635038267, "digest": "pVkEYlfy6n0zTitkarF_RvLXvS8aSo-YqdGvHMMkA04", "contributor": "0x421f223e19877D9765Ecd6e8EC4812457229B36A"}

平台快讯\n\n获取项目的另一个渠道就是资讯平台。\n\n尤其关注快讯。\n\n目前能用且有一定价值信息的快讯平台是[链闻](https://www.chainnews.com/)和金色财经。\n\n如果你觉得每天弹窗信息太多，\n\n你可以选择集中抽一个时间，\n\n在平台上搜索「融资」快速查找项目。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F29IR4Ly-dcOa1xXxtrK33.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n当然这里的项目依然只是为了扩充信息，\n\n毕竟融了资的也不一定都是好项目，\n\n你还需要在后续进一步筛选。\n\n## 工具筛选\n\n前面我们提到了Dappradar的工具。\n\n在筛选项目的时候，\n\n使用一些第三方工具，\n\n从数据角度出发也是一个不错的选择。\n\n[Dappradar](https://www.dappradar.com/)、[Dapp.com](https://www.dapp.com/) 可以帮助你从用户量、交易量等角度筛选项目。\n\n一般来讲数据不会骗人。\n\n在第三方平台上找到数据好的，或者增长趋势好的，\n\n但是你还不知道的项目。\n\n去了解一下，总不会是坏处。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FZ5YLUWzLVDC10oqcJ9RxR.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n了解多了以后，\n\n你会发现数据其实也会骗人。\n\n因为太多项目会刷数据，博眼球。\n\n所以数据只是你的参考标准，而不是唯一标准。\n\n另外，Defi赛道的工具也非常多。\n\n这里我们介绍一个工具叫做：[DefiLama](https://defillama.com/)\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FN5ef0vsJ7qpD3qfQ4Gp0v.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n一般而言，锁仓量的大小会侧面反应项目的价值，\n\n而锁仓量的趋势会侧面反应项目的潜力及风险。\n\n比如在Trader Joe价格上涨之前，\n\n你会看到他的锁仓量正在上升。\n\n而在vee.finance价格下跌之前，\n\n你会看到他的锁仓量正在下降。\n\nDefiLama能够帮助你纵览锁仓量整体情况，\n\n以及按公链维度、Defi的细分赛道维度筛选项目。\n\n如果你是一个关注Defi的人，\n\n这个工具推荐你使用。\n\n同样，Defi的工具也非常多，\n\n我们后面还会谈到一些，\n\n但这也绝不是全部。\n\n在你不断深入的过程中，\n\n你还会有更多的新发现。\n\n## 筛项目：建立标准、快速过滤\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FYBZi06pR0RDuFQiZkoYGW.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n> 你的信息渠道越多，你知道的项目也就会越多。\n>\n> 同时，你能放在单个项目上的时间也会越少。\n>\n> 因此建立一些自己的标准，\n>\n> 快速筛选掉一些看起来不靠谱的项目，\n>\n> 把时间花在刀刃上，是很重要的。\n\n### 铁三角：固定标准\n\n对于我们而言，\n\n我们一般从资方、团队和产品三个角度做筛选。\n\n*   资方：至少1个靠谱的资方\n*   团队：成员背景好，有相关从业经历\n*   产品：产品体验好，赛道有前景且白皮书清晰。\n\n这里的三个维度都没有明确指标，\n\n而是需要在你看了足够多项目后。\n\n通过对比，你才会有一个比较直观的感受。\n\n加上现在很多区块链项目都是匿名团队，\n\n或者产品还没上就开始宣传卖货了。\n\n所以很多时候这样的铁三角，\n\n不一定需要三者俱全，\n\n而是至少占其一。\n\n另外关于资方，很多朋友也知道要看，\n\n但更多的问题是不知道哪个资方算好。\n\n我们提供三种方法：\n\n1-通过[block123](https://www.block123.com/)查找资方情况；\n\n2-到资方官网，查看创始人及过往项目；\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FSVns4trwhqlplJXXmjzkq.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n3-第三方资料。\n\n我们之前拿到一份第三方做的资方排名，\n\n虽然不具备100%可信度，但仍然是一份不错的参考材料。\n\n`文章末尾会告诉大家获得此份材料的方式。`\n\n## 多维度：独立见解\n\n在快速筛选完项目之后，\n\n就到了各显神通的时候了。\n\n初步看起来不错的项目，\n\n值得你多花一点时间去了解更全面的信息。\n\n这里包括但不仅限于：\n\n竞争对手情况、该项目的优劣势、赛道发展前景及周期、代码审计/更新情况、经济模型/持仓占比等。\n\n这里再为大家介绍一个工具：[TokenTerminal](https://www.tokenterminal.com/)\n\n这个工具在看Defi项目的时候会用的比较多。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fs4D-qDEqwCsxAr6fFNN91.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n他引入了很多重要的项目指标，\n\n并能够让你把多个项目放到同一张图里进行对比，\n\n让你快速了解相关项目的数据表现情况。\n\n至于哪些数据指标重要，\n\n我们之前看过一篇来自mint

{"id": "jMNmWi7WQoBUhA3ekkkT1jdRsFUs2DxqIFCJ5ePsvKg", "title": "Our First Product Didn’t Work", "body": "From the beginning of 2019, I’ve felt a queasy sense of not belonging at the job I loved. Everything from the mentorship I received, to the people I got to meet, the intellectual nature of the work itself, and the fantastic relationships developed with my coworkers, should’ve created an experience that felt deeply fulfilling. But it didn’t, and I felt stupid for feeling that way.\n\nGiven the general zeitgest of working in Silicon Valley, the natural way to deal with existentialism is to pour your hope in to an incredibly romanticized view of starting a company. It’s considered a good enough reason to leave a rare job and still preserve some social status. So naturally that is where my brain started wandering to. I wasn’t totally naive — having gone through the process of being an early employee at a blockchain startup gave me some understanding of the brutalness. But it was a dangerous insight as I convinced myself that I knew what I was doing because I had done it before. I didn’t.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcccd6bea-1af2-4727-9040-72d1b4b60f3b_400x225.gif)\n\nThe first sector that consumed my interest was fintech. At Draper Associates, I saw so many fintech companies that were so fundamentally boring, stale, not innovative, and still on paper successful. This perspective was somewhat naive given the regulatory nature of fintech, but I found it baffling. Doing something different in fintech almost felt like an arbitrage opportunity to apply my own creativity. I also felt like it matched what I thought my skills were coming from a business degree, a blockchain background, and my prior job as a venture capitalist. Which looking back feels like such a joke because it’s ridiculous to assume specialization in skills and career at the age of 22. Regardless, I started delving into fintech.\n\nEconomic structures and markets always interested me, so I thought I would change fintech by creating brand new financial products primarily targeting low income Americans — conveniently, a demographic I knew absolutely nothing about. What I did know was that they were underserved by institutions today so the revolutionary companies of tomorrow would ideally arise by serving this demographic’s need today. After a depressing, but strangely rewardin trip through the Midwest, I recruited my COO and eventually my CTO. We put out a super great sounding Medium blog post about our vision that got a lot of congratulatory remarks by our intellectual peer group, but was met with confusion among mentors and friends that had actually built products. We were also super rushed to get an idea together so we could have something to apply to YC with. Foreshadowing.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe672532b-0aad-420e-895c-3a4890005692_280x200.gif)\n\nI left my last day of work in nostalgic tears and began working full time on our company with our COO and CTO. All in all, it was a super rewarding process to build out Heroic’s web application, partner with similar companies, and converse with high impact nonprofits about their perspective on innovation. We realized really quickly though that the financial infrastructure costs of making this work would supercede the expected revenue we would be getting from our customers per transaction. Furthermore, making a legally compliant MVP would cost a large investment of several hundred thousand dollars, which we didn’t have. But even outside of all those logistical points, the greatest discovery was that there wasn’t much market demand for the service we were trying to build, and a lot of our ignorance stemmed from the fact that we weren’t building a product that we would use — we were trying to service an abstract customer base that we thought we understood.\n\nThis realization really hit us after we got rejected from YC and the On Deck program. Getting rejected hurt, but at this point in each of our very short careers, we were quite familiar with the ego sapping sting of “no.” It did, however, encourage us to look back at what we were trying to do and why we were trying to do it. We were rushed by trying to meet the YC deadline so we put together what seemed like a plausible idea, but no great company was ever formed from a premise of trying to meet an investor’s requirements, and young founders almost always succeed by building products that they would use first. I made so many basic, obvious errors that I thought I wouldn’t.\n\nOver the next week and a half, my COO and I spent all day researching, reading, and prototyping different business ideas for our pivot. It quickly became apparent that sitting in a shitty living room all day trying to come up with business ideas was a poor way to approach this problem. It seems as though the best ideas almost always come from a poised mind observing the catalogue of interactions and individual experiences throughout the day, and playing with the ones that seem like they can be changed. With that realization, we knew that to get our next idea, we had to start actually experiencing life and figuring out different ways we can poke and test it. With that, we officially put Heroic finance on pause.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9f1d674-0dc5-4ecd-bac1-26d22c3b3b0e_720x418.gif)\n\nAn important realization that I had was that I didn’t necessarily want to start a company — the source of dissatisfaction was more so the lack of agency, creativity, and authentic work I could produce between the bounds of my job. I used the idea of starting a company as an excuse to leave. For me, work is a deeply personal and emotional thing. At the risk of sounding like the paragon of a snobby Gen-Z, I craved having creative challenges, more immediate accountability, my own brand, and ultimately control over my work. In venture capital, the primary thing you are looking for is profitable businesses, not necessarily the ones that sound the most interesting or feel the most inspired. I was tired of seeing the same SaaS, productivity, or dev tooling companies that, I’m sure have great potential and are incredibly hard to build in their own right, but weren’t the reason why I got interested in technology and entrepreneurship in the first place.\n\nFor me, the businesses I get really passionate about are inspired and fresh in nature. Interacting with them feels as fulfilling as listening through your favorite album or hanging out with a group of old friends. It brings joy by creating value that nobody really thought could exist. It’s about the principles, values, and artistic vision behind the product or service first, and its ability to become a billion dollar company second.\n\nI know this line of thinking is dangerous and probably stupidly idealistic. It is why I would have failed as an investor. You get disasters like WeWork or Theranos, but sometimes you get magical websites like Reddit and Spotify. Inspiring and game changing. Even though I know I’m probably being silly and naive, I don’t want to give up on my idealistic vision of technology and the ways it can solve problems without at least first trying to be what I seek.\n\nAs for me, I’m going to take the next few months exploring my creative side and diving deeper into my authentic self while building products that I think are useful and beautiful in my own life. A huge part of that is going to be writing more so I hope to put out interesting content in regards to the future of technology and my own creative journey. I’m going to LA in a week to help my aspiring rapper friend Sree record some songs and ramp up his online presence. After that, I hope to go to Seattle to work with one of the first brands that ever got me into fashion. On the side, you’ll see me posting a lot about the future of tech and random products that I am working on.\n\nI’m excited by this new step in my journey and I feel uniquely free in a way I haven’t felt before. Some of the technological themes I am exploring are the future of expression, the passion economy, the intersection of social media from the digital into the physical, decentralized autonomous organizations, and how blockchain fits into the technological world. So if you have any thoughts around that, my Twitter DMs are open! Hopefully by culminating a set of different experiences I can find the thing I want to work on next.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe23e992a-7117-4753-88f4-bdc43986297c_245x200.gif)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635038321, "digest": "Z8tVDD9OjlTryu7hiqx2etNQc6znXpIHy5J3Qtqgm08", "contributor": "0x421f223e19877D9765Ecd6e8EC4812457229B36A"}

Questioning whether or not the decisions made thus far have been principled, the learnings from mistakes substantial, the future reasoned, and the process to internal satisfaction understood. Confusion in its many incarnations. Typically slumbering in the back corners of the mind, assuming the same itchy cognitive load as that of a healing papercut - but flooding in during a train ride home after your phone has died, abandoning you to the full force of your own conscience. \n\n> “I realized these were all the snapshots which our children would look at someday with wonder, thinking their parents had lived smooth, well-ordered lives and got up in the morning to walk proudly on the sidewalks of life, never dreaming the raggedy madness and riot of our actual lives, our actual night, the hell of it, the senseless emptiness.” - Jack Kerouac, On The Road\n\nThe fundamental questions of human meaning haven’t really changed much since the beginning of civilization - when humanity finally got wealthy enough to begin exploring the self actualization aspect of existence. What is a well-lived life? What is virtue? Why should one sacrifice? How does the society we create fit into these ideas?\n\nIn our much more secular and democratic world, it's become harder to answer such questions. Pre-enlightenment we looked towards the monarch, devotion to the City, or the religious leader, devotion to the Church, to define meaning, sacrifice, and virtue. It’s easy to see, even in the modern day, how powerful the City and Church can be in defining something greater than oneself and influencing a person to act against their self-preservational instinct. Referencing the level of corrupt behavior historically displayed by these institutions is not an inditement on how stupid the medieval man was, but rather how emotionally attached a human is to things that offer purpose.\n\nA consequence of the post-enlightenment thought, exemplified by the proliferation of classical liberal values (not the current political sense of the word) in the late 20th century, was the transfiguration of the emotional mortal to the rational individual. The newly minted Homo Econimus. Implying a framework that meaning was found in the social contract and sacrifice was in the context of serving the market. We would have no more holy wars because killing each other over things uneconomic was, naturally, unprofitable. Denying the problematic nature of humanity.\n\nWith such a framework in mind, 9/11 should not have happened. After all, the perpetrators were not impoverished farmers in Africa, or destitute nomads in Nepal, but rather western college educated, wealthy oil barons. If Bin Laden was born in America, he would have been a Rockefeller. And surely people of such background would rationally reject the role of violence in finding religious truth in a new globally dependent, market driven society. Yet the terrorist attack did happen, the westernization policies championed by the UN failed, and we are forced to realize that questions of meaning and virtue are not just private questions respectable citizens don’t talk about, but rather fundamental to our existence and capable of creating significant disturbance to the predominant social order. \n\nI take you on this slight historical detour as it is the same one I went down when realizing the importance of these questions for myself, and it feels like a fun, quixotic parallel between our generation’s bildungsroman, and the general maturation of the human civilization. \n\nTo go from the macro to the micro - after a particularly bad bender of a weekend, I followed my intellectual curiosity and went to a Christian mass. My previous religious exposure was largely limited to Hindu rituals, so this was really my first time experiencing a monotheistic setting. While I’m sure that each church is different, I was quite struck by the welcoming atmosphere, the obvious passion of the church leaders, the honesty of the questions they could explore during a sermon knowing that ultimately we are all equal in the eyes of God, and finally the level of sincerity they seemed to have when answering deep emotional questions. It's quite astonishing to realize that such an institution has survived two millennia of wars, persecution, ridicule, and scandal. This Jesus Christ fella must’ve been a helluva guy. \n\nWhen you interact with a truly devout individual, you can’t help but pick up on a profound sense of calm emanating from them. As the Sikh say “Once you realize God knows everything, you’re free.” I crave that sense of peacefulness and meaningfulness badly. Nothing seems to culturally match the epochal return of religion than the juxtaposition of Kanye West’s new album called Jesus is King, where he praises Christian virtue, with current megastar Billie Eilish’s song called “all the good girls go to hell.” Consider this excerpt from Selah on his new album:\n\n> “God is King, we the soldiers\n>\n> Ultrabeam out the solar\n>\n> When I get to Heaven's gates\n>\n> I ain’t gotta peek over\n>\n> Keepin' perfect composure\n>\n> When I scream at the chauffeur\n>\n> I ain't mean, I’m just focused\n>\n> I ain't mean, I'm just focused\n>\n> Pour the lean out slower\n>\n> Got us clean out of soda\n>\n> Before the flood, people judge\n>\n> They did the same thing to Noah\n>\n> Everybody wanted Yandhi\n>\n> Then Jesus Christ did the laundry\n>\n> They say the week start on Monday\n>\n> But the strong start on Sunday\n>\n> Won't be in bondage to any man\n>\n> John 8:33\n>\n> We the descendants of Abraham\n>\n> Ye should be made free\n>\n> John 8:36\n>\n> To whom the son set free is free indeed\n>\n> He saved a wretch like me”\n\nThis is some real powerful stuff and a fascinatingly divisive point in culture. \n\nWhile Christianity is intellectually interesting in its linear view of time and the virtuous scapegoat figure represented by Jesus Christ, there’s far too much baggage of it as a religion for me to ever truly believe in it. I feel a similar way about most major world religions, and I imagine I’m not alone in that. I don’t doubt that with the changing political and technological global landscape will see a resurgence in the religious, but the social trend is going to manifest in new ways. People are going to look elsewhere for such answers. Unreligious religious entities consisting of fake real prophets. \n\nI’m reading a book called “Man’s Search For Meaning” by Edward Frankl and in the foreward lies this interesting quote:\n\n> “Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. Frankl saw three possible sources for meaning: in work (doing something significant), in love (caring for another person), and in courage during difficult times. Suffering in and of itself is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it.”\n\nFrom the caste system in Hinduism, to the virtuous work ethic character in Protestantism, religion was the sole answer in providing meaning for suffering. At a societal level, the religions that succeeded did a fantastic job of aligning meaning with the wellbeing of the civilization. A weird, social, invisible hand. Among the modern, secular individual, perhaps people find the answer in identity politics and in the social war for their definition of justice. The other fairly new, but massive, trend would be the environmental movement, which interestingly enough reasserts moral principles founded upon science as a critique of the market. And like the religious leaders predicting Armageddon brought on by God, the environmentalist marks the end of times through a correction by nature. Both laying the cause on the folly of mankind. \n\nAt the core, my generation is struggling with finding deep meaning. It’s hard to reconcile working on something significant with the eventual heat death of the universe, in love with its cheap devaluation in a world full of options, and in courage where both sacrifice to the City or Church is seen as illogical. Such dissonance leads naturally to confusion. Comedically expressed and consumed in a self deprecating and casually created meme culture. \n\nI struggle with these questions and have yet to find my personal answer. It does seem though that as social beings, meaning for us is often brought in at the community level, and we derive it from the communities in which we belong and contribute to. Perhaps its an extension of work given meaning in direct relation to the things we humbly accept we love. I see a huge future in social tech that can provide an open platform for people to discover and invest (not only money) into communities that they really believe, and for community leaders to organize. A prediction bolstered by the fact that people are beginning to reject consumerism more to find happiness elsewhere. I am getting increasingly involved in community experiments happening in the blockchain space that try to really go deep on what a community can be. \n\nI’m blending both the macro and micro trends into this brackish blog post because I find what's happening on the global landscape reflective of what’s going on in the hearts of individuals. Society can’t ignore these questions and must allow for the existence of institutions that do, with also a recognition that they symmetrically explore our emotional, potentially problematic side. \n\nAs always, thank you so much for reading, which in a very real sense gives me meaning for my writing.

It began with a final, confused, yet desperate, attempt to break into investment banking in hopes of entering an industry where I would be making money, be regarded as successful, have the next five years of my career planned out, and be too busy to think about what the hell I actually want to do with my life — a question many people my age face and end up drowning out with Piña Coladas and prestige. Well I couldn’t go to Cabo and I got rejected from just about every investment bank I interviewed with so…..\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb81f632-6d60-411c-9e48-f6936a774d92_525x289.gif)\n\nIn a somewhat dazed trance, I continued to fumble through the semester, haphazardly attempting to find something to do over the summer and awkwardly answering questions about what internship I had from well-intentioned friends. I grew to really hate the shallow words of sympathy and encouragement. That ineffable feeling you get when someone pities you gave me this internal anger to completely reject their way of life and prove to them that there are other, better, ways to “be successful.” It feels uncomfortable even writing about this as it really reveals to me how much I had let my individuality and autonomy go — how I was letting my self worth be dictated by the labels I was associated with. In hindsight, my anger was incredibly hypocritical, naive, and irrational, but it did give me the drive to simply try new things with no expectations.\n\nI started to organically search for wisdom and inspiration to get some guidance and perspective on life. I found that once I left my preconceived notions of a successful life, and opened myself up to other people’s perspectives of the world, I met so many different individuals through their art, heard their narratives, learned their philosophies, and viscerally understood how they experienced life. After going through that, it’s hard to be satisfied by anything short of authenticity in action. The artwork of Marcus Aurelius and A$AP Rocky touched my essence in a way nothing really had before and was most influential in me constructing my own idea of what is important to me.\n\nI came across \\*Meditations \\*by Marcus Aurelius (specifically, the Hays translation), almost accidentally, through a Quora answer, and I figured one of the greatest Roman emperors probably had something interesting to say. Outside of my investment banking rejections, discovering this book was probably the best thing to have happened to me. I cannot overstate the level of impact this immortal diary (although he would scoff at that epithet) has had on my life, and I am a little sad that I can’t share every beautiful quote he wrote. If you ever get the chance to read this amazing book, I would highly recommend it, until then I have distilled what I think are his most profound teachings that were the most applicable to my everyday life.\n\nAs a bit of a foreword, \\*Meditations \\*is a collection of private notes Marcus Aurelius wrote to himself during the last 12 years of his life. It is heavily influenced by Stoic philosophy, but often incorporates other schools of Hellenistic thought. Marcus Aurelius himself was regarded as the last of the five great Roman Emperors, presiding from 161 AD to 180 AD, during a time plagued with war and internal strife. To grasp the depth of his virtue, it is important to understand the gravity of his position in that time period, as as he was easily the single most powerful individual on the planet. He could literally do anything he wanted, yet he held on to his philosophy. The last 12 years of his life were far from easy and you get glimpses of the weight he bore on his shoulders — the understanding that death was slowly approaching. What makes \\*Meditations \\*such a powerful read is that it was meant to serve as a guideline for Aurelius himself, never to be read by outside eyes, and thus is a raw reflection of his soul, unpolluted by excessive prose or the need to abstract academic arguments. So what can we learn from this philosopher-king?\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96e01945-e484-48c0-9df1-7d349d62f7a2_800x600.jpeg)\n\n—\n\n*“Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what’s left and live it properly.” “Remember how long you’ve been putting this off, how many extensions the gods gave you, and you didn’t use them. At some point you have to recognize what world it is what you belong to; what power rules it and from what source you spring; that there is a limit to the time assigned to you, and if you don’t use it to free yourself it will be gone and it will never return.”*\n\nA core part of Stoic philosophy, and especially Meditations, is the idea of unconditionally owning your life. No matter the injustices that happen to you, it is ultimately up to you to try and achieve the life you want as you are the only one that is ever going to experience it. Aurelius views life as a gift from the divine, and to waste it away without liberating yourself as something deeply sinful. This idea of self sovereignty and individual responsibility is deeply emphasized throughout the text, but is difficult to internalize. Yet to do so is crucial. On one hand, you can, perhaps even rightfully so, blame the shortcoming of your life on external factors and earn the sympathy and reassurance of your peers — but their words do not matter as they can’t change anything. All they can provide is a shallow comfort from reality. It never lasts. The only thing you can do to change anything is to take action, to take control of what you can and to try, with every ounce of will you can muster, to do something about it while you still can.\n\n\\~\n\n*“Everything fades so quickly, turns into legend, and soon oblivion covers it. And those are the ones who shone. The rest — ‘unknown, unasked for’ a minute after death. What is ‘eternal’ fame? Emptiness.*\n\n*Then what should we work for?*\n\n*Only this: proper understanding; unselfish action; truthful speech. A resolve to accept whatever happens as necessary and familiar, flowing like water from that same source and spring.”*\n\nDeath is a theme Marcus Aurelius explores often. He sees the futility in attempting to live life in chase of immortality through legacy. Because life is only experienced in its totality by the person who lived it, the only life that has value is one that adheres to fundamental principles and individual values. There is no sound rationalization for an action that makes you diverge from the person you want to be, the ideas you want to represent, and the life you want to lead. Throughout my own past, and what I see happen to my friends, is this pressure, verging on the point of indoctrination, to pursue your passions once you are well settled and justify inauthentic acts on the basis of necessity. It’s absurd because being “well settled enough” recursively defines itself as just the next promotion or next opportunity. It never comes. Of course, I used to say, I’m different from everyone else and all I really need is a prestigious brand on my resume so that I can “realistically” do what I want, and everyone agrees because that is their rationalization as well, and there is comfort in numbers. But you cannot ignore the haunting dissonance caused by the contradictory nature of that thought. Breaking out of this toxic cycle and living a life that you know to be good is what Aurelius encourages everyone to do. The underlying goal is to live authentically, not so that people remember you as such, but so that you know yourself to be good. That is all that really matters.\n\n\\~\n\n*“Beautiful things of any kind are beautiful in themselves and sufficient to themselves. Praise is extraneous. The object of praise remains what it was — no better and no worse. This applies, I think, even to “beautiful” things in ordinary life — physical objects, artworks. Does anything genuinely beautiful need supplementing.”*\n\nThe first time I came across this passage, I found it to be fascinating as it presented a new way of looking at the world. It is quite similar in its core message to the passage above, but it is communicated in a different way, and able to communicate a cliche in a refreshing fashion that still makes you think displays Aurelius’ acute understanding of the world. You must distance yourself from words, both in praise and in shame, and believe in what you know to be true. I found it interesting that he chose to show the meaninglessness of praise, rather than the common method used by inspirational personalities that focuses on overcoming negativity. It communicates a sense of meditative serenity. In our lives, if people are pressuring you to do something antagonistic to who you are as a person, no amount of peer approval takes away from the fact that it is an ignoble act. This is something that often hinders us as young adults. You cannot let other people define right and wrong, beauty and inelegance, or symphony and cacophony, because you are given the incredibly profound gift of experiencing it for yourself.\n\n\\~\n\n*“You’ll find that none of the people you’re upset about has done anything that could do damage to your mind. But that’s all “harm” or “injury” could mean. Yes, boorish people do boorish things. What’s strange or unheard-of about that? Isn’t it yourself you should reproach — for not anticipating that they’d act this way? The logos gave you the means to see it — that a given person would act a given way — but you paid no attention. And now you’re astonished that he’s gone and done it. So when you call someone ‘untrustworthy’ or ‘ungrateful,’ turn the reproach on yourself. It was you who did wrong. By assuming that someone with those traits deserved your trust. Or by doing them a favor and expecting something in return, instead of looking to the action itself for your reward.”*\n\nNo Stoic text can be complete without such a principle — that there is so much that you can’t control, and that’s okay, because what you can control is the way you perceive what happens to you. Very little of what people say and do to you really hurts you fundamentally as a person, unless you let it. Because you have that final say, Aurelius shifts the burden to you. It is silly and unproductive to get mad when people betray your trust, or hurt you in whatever way, as that is what flawed people do. Few people would disagree with the fact that humans are flawed creatures, subject to the whims of their instincts and emotions; therefore, being appalled when a flawed person does something wrong is your fault. No one would be shocked at the possibility of getting bitten by a snake on a trail because we understand that it is a natural thing for snakes to do. To expect them to do anything else would be arrogant. To expect flawed people to not do what is natural to them, or, even worse, to expect them to be flawed to everyone else besides you is despotic. What we need to work on is how we perceive the situation. When judging your own actions, also understand that you also can not be perfect, and that is okay as long as you strive to be better.\n\n\\~\n\n*“Human life.*\n\n*Duration: momentary.*\n\n*Nature: Changeable.*\n\n*Perception: dim.*\n\n*Condition of the Body: decaying.*\n\n*Soul: spinning around.*\n\n*Fortune: unpredictable.*\n\n*Lasting Fame: uncertain.*\n\n*Sum Up: The body and its parts are a river, the soul a dream and mist, life is warfare and a journey far from home, lasting reputation is oblivion.*\n\n*So what can guide us?*\n\n*Only philosophy.*\n\n*Which means making sure that the power within stays safe and free from assault, superior to pleasure and pain, doing nothing randomly or dishonestly and with imposture, not dependent on anyone else’s doing something or not doing it. And making sure that it accepts what happens and what is dealt as coming from the same place it came from.”*\n\nThis is perhaps one of the most profound passages I have ever read and I am inclined to limit my analysis so as to not accidentally dilute its message. It is something that struck me as true wisdom. It also summarizes well what Marcus Aurelius thought of the human condition and the way to deal with the futility we all feel. It paints a brutal picture of the human condition, yet gives us reprieve in a way that sounds honest and attempts to illuminate, as opposed to being preachy with the intent to convince. Ultimately, we trend towards death along a chaotic path, and the only thing we can do to ground us and be happy is to be true to the philosophy we believe in. He encourages us not to view philosophy as a teacher, but rather as a framework to fall back on when being honest to your virtues sounds less like a truth and more like a Care Bears cliche.\n\n—\n\nI often find myself turning to the words of Marcus Aurelius whenever I feel anxious about life and need to be grounded. I genuinely view reading his texts as something that gave me the courage to take my life into another direction. I hope you do not dismiss what he has to say as the abstract musings of an individual safely tucked away from the brutalities of life. That could not be further from the truth. We must remember that this is not an organized body of text, rather the diary of an emperor in the final years of his life, hoping to remind himself of what was ultimately important. Marcus Aurelius was one of the few leaders in history that was able to reject the seduction of power, in favor of the nobility of virtue. The level of relatability people have with this text after a millennia only vouches for the inherent truths of life it speaks to. This is only a small snippet of what \\*Meditations \\*has to offer, but I hope it gave some inspiration. It would be arrogant, and totally dishonest, for me to say that I now live life according to every principle I respect, but it gave me the strength to try.\n\nTangibly,\\* Meditations\\* led me to have the confidence and willingness to pursue work in blockchain, a technology I believed in deeply at the philosophical level, as an actual career. I had tried in the past, yet gave up at the steep learning curve on the assumption that I would probably be pursuing a prestigious career in finance anyways and could understand it later on in life. Marcus Aurelius made me confront the obvious dishonesty in such a statement. I’m lucky to say that in my case it led to me to hustle for opportunity in blockchain — culminating with advising a company I helped create and joining a Venture Capital firm I love.\n\nWhereas *Meditations* and Marcus Aurelius helped me find the courage and inspiration to become the person I am today, A$AP Rocky, the focus on the second part of this blog post, gave me the confidence to look into the future and dream big.

{"id": "VbgTABAeUYVXKIxeKJOuwMrFQwnwPC60AJWz9bn55JM", "title": "why axs", "body": "2021\\.7.16 \n\n近日，游戏板块以Axie Infinity（AXS）为代表的资产在币圈链圈走红，可以说是一路高歌，让人始料未及，那我们来说说AXS。Axie Infinity(AXS)是在以太坊区块链上构建的，受神奇宝贝启发的数字宠物世界，任何人都可以通过熟练的游戏玩法和对生态系统的贡献来获得代币奖励。就在菲律宾， CNBC报道，满头白发、亮眼昏花的老年大爷玩家，都沉浸在Axie Infinity体验里，说了都不相信，但这就是事实。火爆的游戏背后，裂变式爆发，不乏有“羊毛党”，部分游戏玩家还开启了多机同时刷游戏模式。\n\nAxie Infinity是目前排名第一的NFT游戏，也是以太坊上流量最多的应用程序之一。目前超过45000名以太坊用户持有Axies，其中超过41000人每天都在玩。NFT的交易量每月超过1500万美元，原生代币的完全稀释市值超过20亿美元。该公司最近筹集了他们的A系列750万美元的资金。\n\n## 接下来深度解析一下Axie Infinity（AXS）项目:\n\n游戏玩法:\n\nAxie Infinity是一个复杂的游戏生态系统，它基于由遗传算法产生的具有不同稀有度和效用的NFT。每个Axie是一个ERC20代币，具有独特的特征，影响其稀有性和游戏中的效用。每个Axie的特性取决于其父母的特性，当一个新的Axie诞生时，根据遗传算法，以概率方式组合起来。\n\n游戏由一个Token系统支持，包括两个实用Token：游戏内货币（LPT）和治理Token（AXS）。\n\n培育Axies是玩家从游戏中赚钱的方式之一，因为新的Axies可以在市场上以ETH出售。说到游戏，区块链里的游戏与传统中心化游戏有啥区别呢？中心化的游戏，玩家在其中消费的各类道具、装备等由各类游戏公司主导，有可能面临各类道具的增发，而玩家只能被动接受，无法真正从游戏中受益。区块链游戏则是数据不可篡改，规则透明，类似于消费投资属性，虚拟资产确权，使得各位游戏玩家拥有自己的游戏资产。\n\n关于Axies的价值\n\n然而，并非所有Axies都是平等的：他们的价值是由稀有性和实用性共同决定的。整个Axie的数量可以根据不同的稀有性或稀缺性等级来区分。与Axies一般的通货膨胀供应相反，\"起源Axies \"的供应是严格限制的（约4000）。更加稀少的是 \"神话 \"Axies，这是起源Axies中一个较小的类别（约有⅓个）。\n\nAxies的效用主要由他们在战斗中的作用决定，而这又取决于Axies的属性、能力和资源（下文将详细介绍）。稀有性和实用性的因素在实践中往往是重叠的——例如，只有起源Axies（稀有的一类）可以开发神秘部件，这不仅使Axies更加稀有，从而在战斗中更加强大。Delphi Digital公司的这份报告更细致地分析了Axies的相对稀有性。\n\nAxies的战斗\n\nAxies产生收益的方式—— 其效用的重要部分——是通过与其他3至6人的Axies团队进行战斗。敌对的玩家轮流攻击对方的队伍，打出与他们的Axies的特定战斗动作相对应的牌，直到一个队伍被完全击败。Axies的战斗围绕着几个核心机制展开：Axie的状态、能力和资源（能量和抽卡）。这些基本数据由Axie的等级决定，每个等级在战斗中都有特定的作用。这样一来，获胜的Axies团队就能协同工作，例如，一些人在攻击方面更出色，另一些人在防御方面更出色。\n\n从上面的描述可以看出，与Axies的战斗是相当复杂和高度战略性的，因此需要玩家的真正技能。当战斗成功时，玩家会赢得游戏中的货币SLP。\n\n游戏中的货币：小型爱情药水(SLP) \n\n## 为Axie经济提供动力\n\n正如我们上面所探讨的，SLP是Axie Infinity内部经济的燃料。SLP可以在游戏中用于培育新的Axies，也可以通过游戏，特别是通过赢得战斗来获得。SLP是一种无上限的实用代币，也就是说，随着越来越多的玩家加入游戏，它的供应量也在增长。培育Axies需要这种Token，这是玩游戏赚取收入的一个主要途径。每次繁殖的SLP成本是父母Axie的品种数的函数——每个品种数越高，繁殖需要的SLP就越多。\n\n治理令牌：Axie Infinity Shards（AXS）\n\nAxie Infinity Shards（AXS）是Axie宇宙的ERC20治理代币。AXS持有者是为了影响Axie Infinity的未来，表示他们对生态系统升级的支持，并决定社区财政的使用。与游戏中的货币SLP相比，AXS在元水平上管理Axie生态系统。   \n\n## 所有权经济的激励措施\n\n由于AXS的价值与Axie Infinity游戏和生态系统的成功松散地联系在一起，它允许额外的资本进入，而不需要持有Axies或直接玩这个游戏。\n\n另一个起作用的关键机制是押注：AXS持有者可以将他们的Token存入治理平台内获得收益，提高AXS的资本资产属性。此外，赌注奖励积极参与，并逐渐稀释被动持有人（在钱包或交易所的Token）。 \n\n最后，AXS可以用来激励那些不在游戏本身层面上的特定行为（SLP会更适用）。从参与公共竞标赛到治理投票，甚至是产生内容，AXS是一个灵活的工具，为创造社区价值设置激励。\n\n## 游戏和加密货币的融合？\n\n游戏是一般新的加密货币用户的焦点，并推动了加密货币用户体验和可扩展性方面的创新，为整个行业提供了巨大的价值。Axie Infinity显示了这种与整个加密货币的互动是如何进行的——来自去中心化金融（DeFi）的创新进入了最新的token设计，从有收益的NFT到治理Token。在未来，我们预计加密货币内的游戏和金融之间的这种融合将加速。金融将变得越来越游戏化，游戏将变得越来越金融化。特别是在一个开放的元空间背景下，游戏和赚钱的结合会让越来越多的人感兴趣。最重要的是，这些发展可能会从根本上改变未来游戏的文化观念：从一个书呆子的时间沉淀到一个被接受和重视的谋生方式。", "timestamp": 1635041101, "digest": "N-IlWv420PeMcnlHn_iUuaCLjQQN6Ggto6V2Vz-49M8", "contributor": "0x61DB9Cf30dEcC1d8DF4C89C242E26BB8453FDD85"}

I remember one question that drove me to tears:\n\n> *“Circle the picture that looks the most like a lamp.”*\n\nThere were four pictures. A desk. A bed. A couch. And last but not least, a lamp. The question didn’t make any sense. One of the pictures didn’t just look *like* a lamp. It *was* a lamp. In my mind, there should’ve been a picture of something that only resembled a lamp.\n\nEvery question posed the same kind problem. It was open to ten interpretations, at least for me. In the end, I didn’t finish the test. The school tried to place me in special education courses, but my parents objected — mainly out of shame and embarrassment.\n\nFor about ten years, they treated me like a total idiot. They yelled at me for making simple mistakes. My dad called me stupid under his breath. It was around that time they started planning to have another kid. That turned out to be my brother, who they considered bright.\n\nEverything changed when I turned 14.\n\nMy school gave everyone another one of those IQ tests. This time, I didn’t waste a lot of brain power on it.\n\nI just answered the questions.\n\nA few weeks later, the gifted program came for me. They changed my classes. Kids who ignored me suddenly wanted to be my friends. Teachers looked at me differently. They took the time to learn my name. The rules seemed to relax. The courses got more interesting.\n\nThere were fewer worksheets. There was less homework. *A lot* less. Everything was a project. We were told to be creative.\n\nWe were encouraged to have fun.\n\nWe were told we were smart.\n\nIt worked.\n\n# We’re obsessed with intelligence.\n\nEveryone needs to feel like a genius these days, at least over here in America. They have to be the smartest person in the room.\n\nHave you noticed?\n\nIt’s gotten especially bad lately. We’ve got half the country thinking they’re smarter than doctors. Politicians post bullshit memes about thalidomide or Ivermectin and tell everyone to “do your own research.”\n\nThey can barely use Google…\n\nI’ve thought our key problem is that we reward stupidity. Maybe the real problem is that everyone tries too hard to sound smart. They use words they don’t know. They make claims they can’t support. They pretend to be scientists, when they’re really just surfing the web. Millions of Americans think Bret Weinstein is a genius because he wears tweed and tells them what they want to hear, while spoonfeeding them bad science.\n\nThere’s a hundred apps and a thousand supplements all promising to boost your brain performance. Some of us spend thousands of dollars on audiobooks that offer the same gimmick. All of this is the 21st century version of playing Mozart for babies. It doesn’t work. There’s no real science behind it. The companies that sell this crap know.\n\nThey don’t care.", "timestamp": 1635042114, "digest": "HYoayTuwU1EfCxFLeGpxaciWVlEm_GcLGTUkraGbXPs", "contributor": "0xDEc04BA1D66cA3803A961F871357ee348fe944C9"}

We cannot make a transaction that calls both Aave and Uniswap smart contracts at the same time.\n\nDue to this fragmentation, composability is limited, so the magic of DeFi is greatly limited.\n\nThis can be remedied by an interoperability layer like Polygon, which is seeking to connect all L2 solutions in a standard framework. However, it will be a long process for all solutions to be built according to Polygon's standards and platforms. \n  \n \n\nLiquidity Another problem with the fragmentation of Dapps on different L2s is that their related liquidity is also dispersed.\n\nLiquidity is very important in any financial market, because it provides a healthy market where buyers and sellers can meet and exchange goods on the open market without making too many compromises on the buying and selling prices, nor Will cause crazy price fluctuations.\n\nAt present, all liquidity exists in Ethereum-which provides a healthy and deeply liquid market for all financial products and tokens on the platform.\n\n随着向 L2 的转变，我们将看到现有的流动性被拆分为以太坊 L1 和不同的扩展解决方案——而不是在以太坊上提供所有流动性。 \n \n\n摩擦\n\n最后，因为我们正在接近以太坊之上的多链 L2 世界的最终状态，为了与 DeFi 交互，每个第 2 层之间将存在严重的摩擦。\n\n我们可能会在 L2 之间看到很多桥梁，因此当我们尝试在链之间转移资金时，预计会有很长的入职时间。\n\n还期望拥有多个帐户——每个 L2 链一个或多个。从用户体验的角度来看，跟踪这些扩展解决方案的资金将是一件令人头疼的事情。\n\n假设我们在 Polygon 上有 AAVE，我们想使用 Uniswap on Optimism 将其换成 UNI。\n\n我们不仅必须将 AAVE 从 Polygon 撤回以太坊（目前 - 跨 L2 桥应该即将到来），我们还必须将我们的 AAVE 从以太坊 L1 转移到 Optimism。\n\nPolygon 的取款时间大约需要 15 分钟（我计时），而 Optimism 假设有 1-2 周的入职时间，因为它使用了乐观汇总（回想一下，由于“挑战”，ORU 有很长的入职时间期间'以在证明中发现欺诈）。 \n  \n 闭幕式\n\n当然，这些问题肯定是可以解决的，并且可能会在所有主要 L2 扩展解决方案公开发布后不久解决——由于以太坊开发者社区的强大火力。\n\n我确实认为我们最终会在 L2 领域看到一些整合——根据每种技术的优势（例如，DEX 和支付），少数赢家脱颖而出。\n\n我希望它们之间还有一个强大的互操作协议，以保持可组合性和流动性——无论是通过 Polygon 框架还是通过强大的 L2 到 L2 桥接网络。\n\n[安东尼·萨萨诺](https://twitter.com/sassal0x)说得最好：\n\n> *You can think of what’s happening in the layer 2 ecosystem right now as the “adoption and innovation” phase where many different solutions are being tried and tested at once in parallel. Of course, not all of them will succeed over the long-term. Ultimately I don’t think there will be just one solution that “wins” the scalability wars. As I said, each scalability solution comes with its own trade-offs, trust assumptions and general strengths & weaknesses. Some are really good for payments, some allow for EVM-compatability and some offer greater scalability at the cost of decentralization.*\n\n来源链接：[cointelegraphcn.com](https://cointelegraphcn.com/news/layer-2-wont-save-ethereum)", "timestamp": 1635050818, "digest": "EQkMydPmEe4DjaXf2_n0bYhPALaEF2zI-3_sTbA8UB0", "contributor": "0xBe4e91ae63090EeB4165dFCfc35dB3a4Eb76e75e"}

Bob has 1 winning ticket for 1 SOL.*\n\n**Claim**: Once the lottery is complete users will be able to claim their SOL for any tickets that did not win as well as claim their Drop Boxes for winning tickets. Users can then redeem their Drop Box on the HOAG Network website (details below).\n\n*   *Example: Alice claims 5 SOL for her 5 non-winning tickets and Bob claims his 3 SOL for his 3 non-winning tickets. Alice claims her 3 Drop Boxes from Raydium and can immediately redeem her 3 Drop Boxes on the HOAG Network website for 3 NFTs or choose to trade her Drop Boxes on Serum and allow someone else to claim.*\n\n***Lottery Transparency***\n\n*The lottery will be done on-chain, with lottery numbers assigned to tickets in the order that users deposit in the pool. After the pool closes, winning numbers will be determined by hashing a block, multiplying it by the timestamp, and matching the last digits of that number with user ticket numbers. Any ticket number with the last digits matching is designated a winning ticket. This process will be repeated until all the winners are determined.*\n\n## 2.

Each Drop Box token can then be redeemed on the project’s website to mint one original NFT from the project collection at random.\n\n**HOAG Network DropZone details**\n\nTotal NFTs minted at launch: 5,000 Munk NFTs\n\nTotal Drop Boxes: 5,000 Drop Boxes, each redeemable for 1 NFT\n\nFixed NFT/Drop Box price: 1 SOL\n\nModel: Lottery for allocation\n\nAllocation for winning ticket: 1 Drop Box\n\nTotal number of winning tickets: 5,000\n\nPool opens: November 1, 12:00 UTC\n\nPool closes: November 1, 14:00 UTC\n\nOpen period of the pool: 2 hours\n\n**IMPORTANT: Drop Boxes must be redeemed on the **[**HOAG Network Website**](https://hoag.network/)** by November 3, 14:00 UTC.**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*SgOKZ3W7QyQqQGSR)\n\n## Eligibility and pool details:\n\nThere will be one SOL pool for RAY Stakers available for the HOAG Network drop.\n\n*   Allocation will be determined by a lottery system.\n*   Allocation for one winning lottery ticket: 1 Drop Box\n*   The pool will be open for 2 hours\n*   **Only RAY stakers will be eligible for the HOAG Network drop**\n\n## How does it work?\n\n**Tickets**: Users must deposit SOL for each ticket they wish to have entered.\n\n**2-day RAY staking deadline**:\n\n*   Eligibility: At least 10 RAY staked in[ RAY single-sided staking](https://raydium.io/staking/) prior to the 2-day staking deadline below and successful SOL deposit once the pool opens. RAY must remain staked until the pool opens.\n*   Lottery tickets: at least 1 ticket for the first 10 RAY staked, and additional tickets for 30, 50, 100, and 150 RAY staked based on the tiers below. Staking more than 150 RAY will still receive 5 tickets maximum.\n*   2-day staking deadline: October 30, 12:00 UTC\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*XV262Mvo7exoIevvk96kZw.png)\n\n*\\*Reference: 100 RAY is the minimum staking requirement for 1 ticket in an AcceleRaytor IDO launch*\n\n**15-day RAY staking deadline**:\n\n*   To reward longer-term Raydium holders, users that are eligible for the 15-day deadline will **receive additional tickets** on top of any received for the 2-day deadline.\n*   Eligibility: At least 10 RAY staked 15 days prior to the 15-day staking deadline below and successful SOL deposit once the pool opens. RAY must remain staked until the pool opens.\n*   Lottery tickets: 1 ticket for each 50 RAY staked up to 250 RAY, in addition to tickets received for the 2-day staking deadline. As such, users who stake RAY for 15 days will be capped at a maximum of 10 tickets.\n*   15-day staking deadline: October 15, 12:00 UTC (snapshot already taken)\n*   *Example: Alice has had 500 RAY staked before the 15-day deadline. She will receive 10 tickets — 5 for the 2-day deadline 150 RAY max allotment, and an additional 5 for the 15-day deadline 250 RAY max allotment.*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*S-kaSaB2dozpAAvemaZG8g.png)\n\n*Example: Alice has 10 tickets as the above example. Bob staked 100 RAY before the 2-day deadline and will receive 4 tickets, 1 for 10 RAY staked, 1 for 30 RAY staked, 1 for 50 RAY staked and 1 for 100 RAY staked before the 2-day deadline.*\n\n**Deposit**: When the pool opens, **users will need to deposit 1 SOL for each ticket for it to be counted in the lottery**. Users can choose to deposit less than their total ticket allocation, however, tickets without a matching deposit will not be entered in the lottery. Deposits must be in multiples of 1 SOL.\n\n*   *Alice deposits 8 SOL, even though she has 10 tickets, to ensure that 8 of her tickets are entered in the lottery. In Alice’s case only 8 tickets will be entered in the lottery. Bob deposits 4 SOL to ensure all of his tickets are entered in the lottery.*\n\n**Lottery**: Once the pool closes, the lottery will take place, and winning tickets will receive a Drop Box for 1 SOL, each. The Drop Box can be redeemed on the HOAG Network website for a random Munk NFT.\n\n**IMPORTANT: Drop Boxes must be redeemed on the **[**HOAG Network Website**](https://hoag.network/)** by November 3, 14:00 UTC.**\n\n*   *Example: Alice has 3 winning tickets and will receive 3 Drop Boxes for 3 SOL. Bob has 1 winning ticket for 1 SOL.*\n\n**Claim**: Once the lottery is complete users will be able to claim their SOL for any tickets that did not win as well as claim their Drop Boxes for winning tickets. Users can then redeem their Drop Box on the HOAG Network website (details below).\n\n*   *Example: Alice claims 5 SOL for her 5 non-winning tickets and Bob claims his 3 SOL for his 3 non-winning tickets. Alice claims her 3 Drop Boxes from Raydium and can immediately redeem her 3 Drop Boxes on the HOAG Network website for 3 NFTs or choose to trade her Drop Boxes on Serum and allow someone else to claim.*\n\n***Lottery Transparency***\n\n*The lottery will be done on-chain, with lottery numbers assigned to tickets in the order that users deposit in the pool. After the pool closes, winning numbers will be determined by hashing a block, multiplying it by the timestamp, and matching the last digits of that number with user ticket numbers. Any ticket number with the last digits matching is designated a winning ticket. This process will be repeated until all the winners are determined.*\n\n## 2. Drop Box redemption for a HOAG Network Munk NFT:\n\n*   After the DropZone lottery ends, users can claim their winning Drop Box.\n*   Users can then navigate to the HOAG Network website and immediately redeem their Drop Box for one Munk NFT.\n*   **Drop Boxes must be redeemed on the **[**HOAG Network Website**](https://hoag.network/)** by November 3, 14:00 UTC.**\n\nNote: Drop Boxes are transferable and tradable prior to redemption, but they must be redeemed for a Munk NFT by November 3, 14:00 UTC.\n\nFor questions on redemption, please[ contact HOAG Network](https://discord.com/invite/QeyPpjfbrH).\n\n## About HOAG Network:\n\nWinners of the Media Network prize for Solana Season Hackathon, HOAG Network is a self-hosted video platform that empowers creators with Web3 features, micropayments, and NFTs.

报税简直糟透了。它凌乱、烦人、昂贵，而且对很多人来说会产生焦虑。\n   所有这些都是为了创建 IRS 已经拥有的表格！5) 那么为什么美国国税局不能透明并帮助纳税人呢？\n   为什么它不能给你它所拥有的信息？\n   您仍然可以做出关于如何提交的所有决定--但对很多人来说，这会容易得多。6) 不管怎样，在我成长的几年里，我父亲的大部分时间也都在旅行，从萨克拉门托——加利福尼亚州的首府——帮助该州建立了向居民发送已有信息的能力。对于很多人来说，报税的时间从几天到几分钟。7) 但是，当然，报税越难、越令人沮丧、定义越不明确，公民报税的成本就越高。\n   而这些成本在相当大的程度上流向了报税软件生产商。\n

PLUS社区进行了一场AMA，表示：在下一个新协议即2.5推出后，创始团队的目标是退后让社区继续扩展协议，而团队会变成背后的幽灵，转向解决另一个关于web3.0的大问题，新协议会自动运行没有像我们的中间人，就像Aave社区在生态中扮演的幽灵角色。\n\n \n\n当天的社区（discord、telegram）都没讨论此事，确切地说是对整个AMA社区都没人讨论。之后DEFI PLUS发布的文字版会议记录也删除了此段发言。\n\n我们咨询了中文社区负责人及Discord管理员，得到的回复是“没有离开的声明”，Discord管理员还多次表示去中心化治理是方向，创始团队会继续为Aave的成长提供帮助。\n\n从AMA的内容看，创始团队将退居幕后并开始做其他协议。从社区管理员的回复来看，暂时没有关于创始团队离开的声明，去中心化治理是方向。\n\n创始人Stani是否会离开Aave？假设离开后会对Aave的发展有什么影响？我们尝试从Stani人物画像、团队情况、去中心化治理发展情况、项目方筹码和动机、其他defi项目去中心化治理情况等方面回答这两个问题。\n\n \n\n二、**Stani人物画像**\n\n1\\. **学历及履历**\n\nStani，2015年-2018年就读赫尔辛基大学（University of Helsinki，位于芬兰首都赫尔辛基的一所世界顶尖大学）并获得法律硕士学位，2016年至今一直担任法律学生协会的成员，从2017年6月正式创立Aave至今。\n\n \n\n \n\n2\\. **人物画像**\n\n我们尝试从一些公开信息及言论去窥见Stani的人物画像。Stani在推特上非常活跃，自2018年1月加入推特以来，共计发推7676条。Stani还会参加各种社区AMA，有一定的社区活跃度。而从Aave的经济生态上看，与Aave合作的机构除了很多知名的币圈项目，还有不少像银行、房地产类的传统圈外机构，可以预见，Stani是一个社交活跃、有非常强的资源整合能力的人。\n\n从6.1-7.22，Stani共发推230条，约4.4条/天，其中，与Aave相关的推特109条，占比47.39%，与web3.0相关的推特有25条，占比10.87%。从其推特的内容来看，Stani对web3.0非常着迷和推崇，并且现在已经开始做相关的工作，由Aave的团队成员之一Jordan负责，现处于alpha阶段。\n\n总结来说，Stani目前还是全部精力投入Aave相关的工作，并且非常活跃，没有表现出丝毫的脱离项目治理或者停下来的迹象；对新事物表现出极大的热情，web3.0的新项目他有非常大可能会参与，尚且不知道参与程度；乐于分享自己的想法，喜欢互动，对defi行业前景看好。\n\n内容\n\n推特数\n\n占比\n\nAave相关\n\n109\n\n47\\.39%\n\nweb3.0\n\n25\n\n10\\.87%\n\n其他加密货币\n\n54\n\n23\\.48%\n\n其他\n\n42\n\n18\\.26%\n\n合计\n\n230\n\n100\\.00%\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n*Stani：在以太坊上创建Twitter，Jordan（首席运营官，COO）负责，alpha。*\n\n \n\n \n\n*Stani在一次采访中表示在以太坊上构建Twitter的事情并不是一个玩笑*\n\n \n\n从Stani的身上，我们大概可以窥见一个成功项目创始人身上重要的品质：全力投入现有的工作，对新事物保持热情，非常强的资源整合能力以及对行业的洞见力。这可能也是Aave创新和安全的重要来源和保障。同时我们可以想象，Stani应该是一个痴迷于“从0到1”的创造者，并且也正在做“从1到100”的事情。他能否同时做好这两件事情，或者更倾向于前者和后者，暂时无法下结论。可能目前他也在尝试和探索的过程，并且已经做出比较稳妥的决定：暂时由团队的其他成员负责新项目。\n\n从人物画像来看，我们推测，Stani目前不会放弃或者停止在Aave这个项目上的工作，但需要关注新项目会否让Stani分散精力甚至影响Aave的进度。\n\n \n\n三、**团队情况**\n\n1\\.

Racero、ernesto-usal、Andrey这3名均是Aave的团队成员，提交代码第二多的The-3D也很可能是团队成员。提交数排名第4的Zer0dot是否是团队成员无法确定。我们假设开发者提交的代码越多，代表对项目开发的作用越大，那么我们可以认为Aave团队成员对项目目前的开发仍然起着决定性作用。如果现阶段团队减少参与甚至停止参与Aave的开发，完全依靠社区治理开发，可能会严重阻碍项目的发展。\n\n同时，我们也注意到，Aave的团队人数在过去的6个月增长了18%，达到51人，人员配置相对充足，不排除部分开发者从团队内部剥离出去成为社区成员的可能。\n\n \n\n四、**Aave的去中心化治理**\n\n1\\. **去中心化治理进程**\n\n（1）2020年9月，Aave治理模块1.0上线，**只有创始团队可以发起提案**，共4次提案，均通过。\n\n（2）2020年10月29日，团队正式**将协议管理密钥移交给治理智能合约，由社区共同进行管理**。\n\n（3）2020年12月17日，Aave治理模块2.0上线，普通社区成员也可以发起提案。截止2021年7月27日，共发起提案21个，全部通过并执行。\n\n \n\n2\\. **Aave的治理流程**\n\n（1）在治理论坛创建Aave Request for Comments (ARC提案)\n\n任何人都可以创建ARC提案，8万枚可通过\n\n（2）ARC经过社区投票通过后，提交Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP提案)\n\n \n\n一般提案\n\n特殊提案\n\n创建门槛\n\n0\\.5%，**8万枚**\n\n2%，**32万枚**\n\n参与数\n\n2%，**32万枚**\n\n20%，**320万枚**\n\n通过数\n\n50\\.25%以上\n\n57\\.5%以上\n\n*注：特殊提案指涉及AAVE和stkAAVE代币升级、v2 治理参数任何变化的提案。*\n\n \n\n（3）一旦AIP被编写，需要提交github\n\n（4）AIP会列入官方治理模块，进入投票流程\n\n（5）通过投票的AIP开始自动执行和实现\n\n \n\n五、**项目方持仓及动机分析**\n\n根据我们的筹码统计，Aave的项目方（含投资方）持仓稳定在500万左右，价值约15亿美元。总持仓占AAVE代币流通总量的37%以上，占AAVE代币发行总量的31%以上，对AAVE币价的涨跌起决定性作用。从控制筹码的比例和价值来看，AAVE项目方没有让项目失控的动机和可能，短期内不可能把项目的控制权交出。\n\n自从2020年10月1日LEND代币以100:1的比例迁移成新的AAVE代币以来，排除前期统计误差的数据，Aave的项目方的持币数量一直高于320万枚，正好高于特别提案的参与票数门槛。Aave的项目方从筹码数量上保证了发起特殊提案的能力，筹码分布的比例也几乎可以确保项目方对任何提案的控制权。\n\n总的说，从筹码上看，Aave所谓的去中心化治理，短期还是在项目方控制下的治理。\n\n \n\n六、**其他defi项目的去中心治理**\n\n1\\. **MakerDao宣布完全去中心化**\n\nMaker基金会CEO Rune Christensen在2021年7月20日发文《MakerDAO Has Come Full Circle》宣告，MakerDAO正式交给社区，实现彻底的去中心化。基金会将在未来几个月解散。\n\nMakerDao的去中心化进程大事件如下表所示：\n\n2018 年 6 月 21 日\n\n基金会提案发布\n\n \n\n该提案后来更新，列出了可持续去中心化治理的核心原则\n\n2020 年 3 月 25 日\n\nMKR代币合约转移给Maker治理\n\n \n\nMKR持有者完全控制MKR合约，去中心化治理是更改MKR代币授权的唯一途径\n\n2021 年 3 月 25 日\n\n核心单元框架获得批准\n\n \n\n核心单元框架为所有Maker协议团队和活动的去中心化治理铺平了道路\n\n2021 年 5 月 3 日\n\nMaker基金会将持有的资产归还给DAO\n\n \n\n将 84,000 MKR 归还到 DAO 是进一步去中心化进程中的另一个关键步骤\n\n2021 年 7 月 20 日\n\nRune Christensen 宣布 MakerDAO 完全去中心化\n\n \n\n全球 Maker 社区现在负责 Maker 协议和 DAO 的各个方面\n\n从去中心化提案发布到第一次MKR投票，再到基金会将MKR的资产所有权和控制权完全移交给治理社区，Maker基金会一直是以循序渐进的方式实现MakerDAO的完全去中心化。Maker基金会正在走向解散，各个团队将以“核心小组”为单位，在Maker治理的支持下重新启动其工作。核心小组的成立需要提案申请，且必须通过Maker社区的治理批准。目前，已有至少10个团队提交了在 DAO 的支持和监督下继续运行的提案。其中，部分成员是来自原基金会。\n\n对于Maker项目本身来说，站在当前的时间节点，虽然我们很难判断核心小组模式相较于基金会模式在具体的运行效果上孰优孰略，但有一点基本是可以确定的，就是Maker 基金会的解散将显著降低该项目的监管风险，因为DAO并非法人实体。在全新的组织模式下，Maker最终也将走向由社区控制的完全去中心化。这也是整个DeFi世界去中心化道路的先行者和标杆。\n\n \n\n2\\. **Synthetix创始人回归事件**\n\n2021年6月28日，Synthetix的创始人Kain Warwick 发文《一名老独裁者现身》进行回顾反思，称Spartan Council（斯巴达理事会）成立后自己便逐步脱离了项目日常决策，并将管理权移交理事会，导致后续逐步与核心贡献者失去联系，从而形成负反馈循环，使得项目团队优先事项不明确、挫折感越来越大，因此自己决定重新参与理事会竞选并帮助协调实现2021年剩余的路线图规划，同时将在核心贡献者内部建立更清晰的组织结构和领导团队，并计划提出一个由理事会成员、核心贡献者和外部利益相关者组成的风险委员会，以确保风险管理融入协议的各个方面。\n\n从Synthetix创立开始，基金会控制项目治理权。2020年7月28日开始，基金会正式退出管理，从基金会治理模式过渡至DAO治理模式，由三个去中心化自治组织（DAO）控制，并启用代议民主组织斯巴达理事会，该委托治理理事会共有七个开放席位，每个席位均通过Snapshot投票选出，通过代币委托授权并控制。\n\n在由斯巴达理事会治理的这一年，Synthetix相比其他defi项目表现比较低迷，项目进展迟缓，尽管我们看到在github代码提交上并没有表现出下降趋势，Kain Warwick认为核心贡献者团队在失去管理后变得效率低下，所以决定竞选理事会并作为领导者推动项目继续发展。\n\n \n\nKain Warwick回归的消息给予市场一定信心，在短时间内币价领涨市场其他代币。可以看出，市场和社区认为，Synthetix新成立的理事会暂且无法代替创始人的作用，对正统的去中心化治理组织的需求并没有想象中高。\n\n回到AAVE项目上，实现去中心化治理是Stani与其创始团队一直以来的主张，但项目发展的现阶段是否需要完全实现去中心化治理，以及是否已经做好平稳过渡的准备，从Synthetix的发展进程上，AAVE或许可以吸取一些经验。\n\n \n\n七、**总结**\n\n1\\. 从Stani的人物画像、言论和项目方持有的代币筹码来看，Stani及其创始团队在现阶段离开团队交出治理权的意愿和可能性非常小。\n\n2\\. 从项目的开发角度上看，AAVE的发展目前离不开创始团队，去中心化治理可能只是对外宣传的愿景，现阶段还没做好平稳过渡的准备。\n\n3\\. 参照MakerDao和Synthetix，或许项目方需要等到社区有足够的开发能力和高效的协作能力，才能考虑完全去中心化。", "timestamp": 1635061078, "digest": "phuJ6LqERRTcsSek2vQKyfwjhDrDHEYZ7dZuwIEhAt4", "contributor":

In the scale, AR4 translates to 'extreme,' while AR5 — which is what he projects this storm to be — means 'exceptional.'\n\n\"AR's 4 and 5 are mostly hazardous, but they can also be very beneficial, as we're seeing in this case, where it's coming on the heels of a serious drought,\" he said. \"And largely the impacts are probably going to be beneficial because it's moisturizing the soil, restoring some water in the rivers, and a little bit of the lakes.\"\n\nBut this storm, according to Ralph, is a rare event. AR5 storms are rare in California, especially during October. Analyzing a 40-year period, his team found only a total of 10 AR5 storms occurred in 40 years, and only one happened in October.\n\nThe impacts also vary depending on the region. Smaller watersheds in urban areas, for instance, may trigger flash floods, while regions where wildfires have left burn scars may experience some debris flows. Transportation, Ralph adds, could also be impacted with the wet roads, cautioning drivers who may travel during the storm event.\n\nUltimately, experts like Ralph say the atmospheric river is needed more than ever to replenish the unrelenting drought in the West.\n\nIn California, dry conditions this summer were the [most extreme](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/14/us/california-summer-drought-worst-on-record/index.html) in the entire 120-year record. It drained reservoirs and triggered historic water shortages. Governor Gavin Newsom recently expanded a statewide drought emergency proclamation.\n\nClimate researchers say two major factors contributed to this summer's severe drought: a lack of precipitation and an increase in evaporative demand, also known as the \"thirst of the atmosphere.\" In this case, the coast did not experience enough storms to quench the thirst of the atmosphere, as well as the drying landscape.\n\nThe [historic drought in the West](https://www.ksl.com/article/50201168/is-this-the-worst-drought-in-utahs-history-heres-what-the-science-and-data-say) also created the perfect landscape for wildfires to spark and expand.\n\nIn the short term, Julie Kalansky, a climate scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, said the storm will help alleviate the dry landscape as well as reduce the potential for fires to spread and ignite.", "timestamp": 1635061675, "digest": "zWPrEso6xvJTT2DbLM83EuhMQJ0ZAE1cGk2N45j7w9E", "contributor": "0xf960c047a47677eA00c94a1074C90850c550c24C"}

Meanwhile, the intensity of storms is also increasing.\n\nThis weekend's bomb cyclone, named for the speed at which it intensifies or \"bombs out,\" is expected to near or set records for the lowest pressure for a storm in the Northeast Pacific Ocean.

Art Blocks上发行的生成艺术就是一个个货币实验\n   Art Blocks的每个NFT作品系列发行量通常在500-1000幅，这一点与传统艺术大大不一样。传统的艺术讲求独特排他性，忌讳同时发行大量同类作品。而Art Blocks上的NFT的每个系列的所有作品会呈现大体类似的风格，只是内容和细节上会有差别。每幅作品的mint和发行价格采用统一价格或者荷兰拍方式，进入二级市场后自由流动。每幅作品的价格虽然有差别，但是本质是联动正相关影响。\n   Art Blocks上发行的每个NFT系列本质上就是一个个”the Currency”（货币实验），甚至可以说是2.0版本的“the Currency”，虽然2.0版本中的每一个项目不一定超越1.0（毕竟the Currency的开创性意义在此），但是一定有超越的，比如Fidenza，比如Ringer，比如……\n2. 生成艺术天然更适合做货币实验，因为NFT本质上还是Token(代币)\n   省略掉NFT作品的外在一切美丑表现，NFT就是代币。\n   NFT的全称是“Non-Fungible Tokens”, 中文译为“不可同质化代币”或“不可替代代币”，通过区块链的数字账本技术呈现。\n   生成艺术，英文名为Generative Art, 是计算机技术和艺术相结合的产物。它的生成不是由人类创作，而是通过算法来生成艺术品，算法有一套规则，在规则内可以自由发挥，最终得出独特的作品，也在一定程度上代表了艺术家的某种理念。\n   在艺术家的艺术与算法成熟的情况下，创作生成艺术作品显然比传统绘制有效率的多，发行500、1000、10000、100000……都是几个小时，甚至更短的时间的事情，而又具有更好的流动性，天然更适合做货币实验。\n3. 有些同一系列数量众多的头像NFT项目也可以看做是一个个货币实验\n4. 货币源于共识，注意力经济、美、独特、实用性等等这些不过是凝结共识，开展货币实验，打造货币的工具和手段。\n   所有的工具和手段的设计都要符合人性需求，就像爱美之心人皆有之，水往低处流，地球自转一样，工具和手段用好了，潜移默化，目的水到渠成。\n\n比如Art Blocks的Fidenza系列，总量有限发行，999幅，在全球货币狂发的大背景下，Art Blocks上第一个发行完整度良好，美学价值突出的生成艺术品，不断突破的单幅作品价格，不断凝结的资金共识，把他们想成一张张货币可以吗？把他们想成一个个比特币可以吗？如果说CrypoPunks得到了加密圈原住民的认可，美学呈现价值突出的类似Fidenza系列的艺术品是不是可以凝结更多非加密圈人士的天然关注，而这正是打造货币需要的凝结共识的必经之路。\n天降降大任于斯人也，通常也是时代的需要，Art Blocks的生成艺术正好契合了时代的需求，也许后续不乏追赶者，但是Art Blocks确实先行了一步。（在此重点答复了Art Blocks上的生成艺术NFT作品为什么火，文字有限，就不多余详述Beeple, CrypoPunks了，后者们更容易理解）\n\n更何况就NFT艺术品本身而言，区块链的链上确权和流动性、展示性的便利度带来的收藏价值可能真的媲美甚至超越传统艺术。\n\nNFT大放光彩，但是目前的NFT也有很多不完美，后续找时间好好聊一聊。", "timestamp": 1635061261, "digest": "L4oXLUD2iN0pn1mbeAz1sOE1qk2QxL8WHr-S9vCnteI", "contributor": "0x61A6129Eb94Ee74D56806E1C62B80f4a4A312934"}

{"id": "a9uIN-E7f9Vw59GRUM2HCuujFpAJW9YPQ4irTdZhXpY", "title": "CBO: Some Reduction in New Drugs to Market", "body": "Finally, PhRMA noted that patients in other countries don’t always have the same access to new medicines as those in the U.S. But in its analysis of H.R. 3, CBO said one of the impacts would be a delay in new drugs for the other six countries named in the bill, and higher prices for the new drugs in those countries as well.\n\nThe CBO did estimate a reduction in new drugs being introduced to the U.S., and global, market. It said H.R. 3 would lead to a reduction in global revenue from new drugs by 19%, and “and in some cases the prospect of lower revenues would make investments in research and development less attractive to pharmaceutical companies.”\n\nIn an August paper on its simulation model, CBO [said](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-08/57010-New-Drug-Development.pdf) a policy like H.R. 3 would cause a 0.5% decrease in new drugs in the first decade, a 5% decrease in the second decade and 8% in the third decade. The admittedly “uncertain” estimate from CBO would amount to 59 fewer new drugs over 30 years.\n\nThis reduction in innovation, or research and development, has long been an argument against negotiated drug prices for Medicare. The CBO didn’t estimate what type of drugs wouldn’t come to market, however. “CBO did not predict what kind of drugs would be affected or analyze the effects of forgone innovation on public health,” it said.\n\nThere’s certainly a debate to be had about how these proposals would affect drug research and development, but the PhRMA ads claim seniors need to be concerned about politicians deciding “which medicines you can and can’t get,” despite their doctors’ wishes.\n\n[Rena Conti](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/rena-conti/), associate professor of markets, public policy and law at Boston University’s Questrom School of Business, [said](https://youtu.be/NKTo_JvIdC4?t=835) in an Oct. 7 briefing held by the nonpartisan Alliance for Health Policy that “scare tactics” about rationing –“raising the specter of people not being able to get drugs now that they need” — don’t accurately describe the current proposals. “This is not really reflective of any of the bills that we are aware of, or proposals that are on the table.”\n\n*FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

{"id": "apdQt8CovPGBK50r7TZQjfw5WlRhxfdmmplkdjOBFVs", "title": "PhRMA Ad Misleads on Medicare Drug Negotiation Legislation", "body": "In TV ads, the pharmaceutical industry claims congressional plans to allow the federal government to negotiate drug prices in Medicare would deny beneficiaries’ access to medicines their doctors prescribe. Experts say that’s unlikely, and an inaccurate portrayal of recent legislation.\n\nUnder current law, the federal government is barred from negotiating prices with drug manufacturers for Medicare. Instead, the prescription drug program, called [Part D](https://www.kff.org/medicare/fact-sheet/an-overview-of-the-medicare-part-d-prescription-drug-benefit/), consists of many privately run plans that conduct their own negotiations and each set their own formulary, or list of drugs they cover — though they are required by Medicare to cover many medications.\n\nPharmacist Samir Balile waits for Vice President Kamala Harris at the pharmacy in a Giant grocery store on Feb. 25, 2021, in Washington, D.C. Photo by Brendan Smialowski / AFP via Getty Images.\n\nThe relevant provision of the law is called the [noninterference clause](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:42%20section:1395w-111%20edition:prelim)). It says the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services “may not interfere with the negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and PDP \\[prescription drug plan\\] sponsors” and “may not require a particular formulary or institute a price structure for the reimbursement of covered part D drugs.”\n\nMany politicians say it’s long past time to create an exception to that clause, allowing the secretary to negotiate prices for some drugs, in order to lower the high cost of medicines in the U.S. and save both the government and seniors money.\n\nEstimates vary on how much more U.S. consumers pay for prescription drugs than many other countries. When [we wrote about this issue in 2017](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/10/trump-misleads-high-u-s-drug-costs/), one expert told us on average brand-name drugs were about 10% to 40% more in the U.S. than in similar industrialized countries. But individual drugs can vary considerably.\n\nMore recently, a 2021 RAND report, funded by HHS, [said](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR2900/RR2956/RAND_RR2956.pdf) that U.S. prescription drug prices in 2018 were 256% of the prices in 32 comparison countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, when considering all the drugs available in the U.S. and those countries. For brand-name originator drugs, meaning drugs manufactured by the company that first got approval for that drug, U.S. prices were 344% those in the comparison countries, while generics were cheaper in the U.S. — at 84% the prices in the other countries.\n\nThe leading legislative proposal now — H.R. 3 — [passed the House](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/116-2019/h682) in December 2019, but went nowhere in the Senate. It was [reintroduced](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3/text) in April. It’s unclear if Democrats will include that proposal — or a different one on Medicare drug negotiation — in the broad reconciliation bill they are crafting. The Biden administration has backed the policy idea, though a proposal it [released](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/09/09/hhs-secretary-xavier-becerra-releases-bold-proposal-lower-prescription-drug-costs.html) on Sept. 9 included very few specifics on how this should be done.\n\nBut the pharmaceutical industry remains opposed to any effort to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices.\n\nRecent TV ads — paid for by PhRMA, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America trade association — raise a familiar claim in debates about changing Medicare: rationing.\n\n“Politicians say they want to negotiate medicine prices in Medicare, but make no mistake,” [one TV spot](https://adm0.page.link/qQbv) begins. “What politicians mean is that they’ll decide which medicines you can and can’t get regardless of what your doctor prescribes, regardless of which medicine has been working, regardless of what new treatments become available.” (Another version of the ad is also [on social media](https://www.facebook.com/PhRMA/videos/1181514139012781/?__tn__=-R).)\n\nAnother features a woman named Sue from Ohio. Sue [says](https://p2a.co/qIoDPVX) she’s a diabetic and that “some in Congress … want to repeal a protection in Medicare that protects access to my medicines. They call it negotiation but it really means the government decides what medicines I can get.”\n\nBut the House bill wouldn’t repeal the noninterference clause.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation says the ads are not accurate. “In fact, the proposed drug price negotiation program does not authorize the federal government to decide which medications people on Medicare can and cannot get and does not establish or require a particular prescription drug formulary,” KFF’s Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare policy, and Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy, [wrote](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/drug-price-negotiation-doesnt-mean-the-government-will-restrict-access-to-medicines/) in an Oct. 7 post. “The legislation under consideration leaves in place the non-interference clause and its specific restrictions with the exception of the proposed drug price negotiation program,” which would concern “a relatively small number” of drugs.\n\nWe asked [Fiona Scott Morton](https://som.yale.edu/faculty/fiona-m-scott-morton), professor of economics at the Yale University School of Management, whether price negotiation in Medicare generally could lead to more limited access to drugs. She said she didn’t think this was something seniors should be worried about, saying the “likelihood that anything is omitted is small, and actually what we really hope is that there are some medicines that are omitted because there are three others that do the same thing” but one is six times the price of the others. She said she wished there was more work done to identify “those products that are not really a good deal.”\n\nAs for the claims in the PhRMA ads, Scott Morton said they are not factually correct. “They’re making up a whole bunch of stuff that is unlikely to happen based on everything we know about the way the law is structured.”\n\nIt is true that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and other experts, expect a negotiation policy to lead to a reduction in revenue for drug manufacturers and a decrease in new drugs coming to market — about an 8% annual average decrease by the third decade after the policy is implemented, CBO [said](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57010).

{"id": "zoOyZy1Acyvvu1HgmxDaJXGKbnHWZGt4icqsYRFMFOU", "title": "Congressional Proposals", "body": "Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act,” would require the HHS secretary to negotiate prices for at least 25 brand-name drugs in 2024 and at least 50 in 2025 and later years – specifically drugs that don’t have generic or similar competitors. The drugs selected would come from a list of 125 drugs that account for the greatest national spending or Medicare spending, and the secretary must negotiate the price of insulin products.\n\nBoth Medicare and private insurers, if they chose to, would pay the negotiated prices.\n\nUnder past proposals, the HHS secretary would have lacked the leverage needed to force drug manufacturers to negotiate Medicare drug prices, and CBO [said](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/110th-congress-2007-2008/reports/drugpricenegotiation.pdf) simply asking drug companies to come to the table would produce “negligible” savings, as [we’ve reported before](https://www.factcheck.org/2007/01/medicare-hot-air/). But H.R. 3 does contain leverage — a high excise tax if a drug manufacturer refuses to participate. And CBO [estimates](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-12/hr3_complete.pdf) the legislation would save at least $456 billion over 10 years (perhaps nearly $530 billion under the latest version of the bill, which increased the number of drugs to be negotiated, [as KFF explains](https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/whats-the-latest-on-medicare-drug-price-negotiations/)).\n\nDrug companies that don’t comply face a steep 65% tax on the previous year’s gross sales of the drug, an amount that would increase to a maximum of 95%.\n\nThe CBO says Medicare premiums and cost-sharing in Part D should go down, and drug prices in other countries should increase.\n\n[Rachel Sachs](https://law.wustl.edu/faculty-staff-directory/profile/rachel-sachs/), a professor at the Washington University in St. Louis’ School of Law whose expertise includes food and drug regulation, and health law, told us that CBO predicts the bill would save “significant amounts” and “that’s because they think these financial impositions will help companies be encouraged to come to the bargaining table.”\n\nH.R. 3 would use international prices in six countries — Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom — to set a target price and a maximum price for negotiations. That maximum price would be 120% of the average international market price in those countries.\n\nThe CBO has said there would be pressure on the HHS secretary, too, to reach an agreement on a price. The CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation “expect that a manufacturer would take its drug off the U.S. market rather than pay the excise tax, so that \\[the\\] tax would have the same effect as if the drug had not been approved for sale or as if the drug was excluded from a national list of drugs (that is, a formulary) that any insurer could cover,” the CBO [said in a February report](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-02/56905-Drug-Price-Negotiations.pdf). “The potential use of the excise tax and anticipated removal of the drug from the United States would serve as a source of pressure on both parties to reach an agreement.”\n\nSachs pointed out that the legislation “is based on prices that companies are already accepting in other countries. So we’re not talking about setting a price that is far below the company’s cost of production.” The pharmaceutical companies make profits at these prices in other countries, she said. “Do we really think that they would walk away from the table and not accept those prices here given the size of our market? … The Medicare program alone is larger than many European countries individually.”\n\nAnd the legislation doesn’t change anything regarding the existing requirements that Medicare cover many medications.\n\n“By law, Medicare Part D plans are required to cover certain drugs per class and in some classes to cover essentially all drugs,” Sachs said. Medicare Part B, which includes coverage for physician-administered drugs, has to cover all drugs that are “reasonable and necessary” for the treatment of illness and injury. Part D plans are allowed to prioritize some of these drugs. “Nothing in H.R. 3 changes any of these rules.”\n\nScott Morton said under this proposal, “I don’t think there will be any products that aren’t on the formulary so to speak … unless something isn’t adding value.”\n\nFor newer drugs that lack an international price, the maximum price would be 85% of the average manufacturer price, which is “the average price charged by drug companies to wholesalers and pharmacists, net of discounts,” [KFF explains](https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/whats-the-latest-on-medicare-drug-price-negotiations/).\n\nDespite what the experts say about H.R. 3 not reducing current access to medications,[ Debra DeShong](https://www.phrma.org/resource-center/Topics/Leaders/Debra-DeShong), executive vice president of public affairs at PhRMA, said in a statement to FactCheck.org that the proposal, or other methods of drug negotiation, would limit drug choices for beneficiaries.\n\n“Government negotiation, whether through a price-setting policy like H.R. 3 or as outlined in legislative proposals from Rep. Doggett or principles released by Senator Wyden, inevitably limits patient choice, especially if that policy is intended as a cost-saving measure,” DeShong said.\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett [introduced a bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2139) in March that would require Medicare drug price negotiations and actually establish a formulary for what drugs would be covered, or require the private Part D plans’ formularies to incorporate the negotiated prices. The bill was referred to committee; CBO has not analyzed it.\n\nThere is still not a consensus on what proposal would be part of the Democrats’ reconciliation bill, which aims to tackle several issues, including health care, the environment, child care and tax policy. Sen. Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, [released](https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/062221%20SFC%20Drug%20Pricing%20Principles.pdf) some general principles of a drug negotiation policy in June, and [has said](https://www.statnews.com/2021/09/14/house-moderates-rebel-against-pelosi-drug-pricing-plan-leaving-bills-fate-uncertain/) some Senate Democrats won’t support H.R. 3. In mid-September, moderate House Democrats [introduced](https://scottpeters.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/reps-peters-schrader-unveil-plan-to-cut-patients-drug-costs-preserve) another bill that would allow for very limited drug negotiation — for some Part B drugs that lack competition.\n\nPolitico [reported](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/09/sinema-prescription-drug-plan-democrats-515749) on Oct. 9 that it’s unclear what policy could garner the necessary unanimous support by Senate Democrats in order to pass. It said that “many lawmakers” believe they can find “a middle ground” between H.R. 3 and the much more limited proposal from moderates.\n\nIn the statement to FactCheck.org, DeShong cited older CBO analyses, saying the CBO “has said that allowing the government to negotiate could only result in savings if the government can remove patient protections and/or restrict access to certain medicines, such as through a formulary.” But CBO didn’t say H.R. 3 would limit access. Even in its analyses of past proposals, CBO [said](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/110th-congress-2007-2008/reports/drugpricenegotiation.pdf) “some source of pressure” would be needed to secure lower prices, such as a formulary, setting prices administratively or taking “other regulatory actions against firms failing to offer price reductions.”\n\nShe further said that Part D plans would naturally favor the better-priced drugs. “Even if health plans are left to make formulary choices, if government-negotiated drugs are cheaper, health plans will steer patients to the government-selected drugs to keep their costs and premiums low. The long-term implications for the marketplace are that the government is picking winners and establishing a de facto group of preferred medicines that limits access and choice.”\n\nPhRMA also pointed us to [a Sept. 9 report from STAT News](https://www.statnews.com/2021/09/09/senate-considers-pegging-medicare-drug-prices-to-deeply-discounted-veterans-affairs-rates/) that said another legislative option could be tying Medicare drug prices to those offered to other government programs, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs. That was “one of seven options outlined in a June 7 slide deck detailing an influential Senate committee’s drug pricing deliberations,” STAT reported.\n\nVeterans Affairs [does](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hpb20171008.000174/full/) set a national formulary and a ceiling on prices for its health care network. PhRMA cited a December 2020 [Government Accountability Office report](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-111.pdf) that found the VA paid “about half” what Medicare Part D paid on average for a sample of 399 prescriptions, both branded and generics, in 2017. One reason for the VA’s lower prices was its single, national formulary, which “can steer utilization toward a limited number of drugs within a given therapeutic class.” The many Part D plans, meanwhile, “generally have broad networks of pharmacies and as such may have broader formularies,” the GAO said.\n\nBut it’s unknown what shape such a proposal would take.

Its finances were struggling, quality was inconsistent by its own admission, and classes met at a local Baptist church.\n\nNow, it has 420, with others turned away for lack of space. It has grown to occupy a 21,000-square-foot former mini-mall, which it moved into in 2020, plus two other buildings down the road.\n\nSmith Mountain Lake is benefiting from a boom in conservative Christian schooling, driven nationwide by a combination of pandemic frustrations and rising parental anxieties around how schools handle education on issues including race and the rights of transgender students.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Continue reading the main story](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/us/christian-schools-growth.html#after-story-ad-1)\n\n“This is a once-in-100-year moment for the growth of Christian education,” said E. Ray Moore, founder of the conservative Christian Education Initiative.\n\nIn the 2019-20 school year, 3.5 million of the 54 million American schoolchildren attended religious schools, including almost 600,000 in “conservative Christian” schools, according to the latest count by the Education Department.\n\nThose numbers are now growing.\n\nImage\n\nFaith West adjusted a partition while preparing to teach a theater class in Smith Mountain Lake’s junior high building.Credit...Veasey Conway for The New York Times\n\nThe median member school in the Association of Christian Schools International, one of the country’s largest networks of evangelical schools, grew its K-12 enrollment by 12 percent between 2019-20 and 2020-21. The Association of Classical Christian Schools, another conservative network, expanded to educating about 59,200 students this year from an estimated 50,500 in the 2018-19 school year. (Catholic schools, by contrast, are [continuing a long trend of decline](https://www.ncronline.org/news/coronavirus/deeper-look-catholic-schools-pandemic-enrollment-plunge).)\n\nWhen the pandemic swept across the country in the spring of 2020, many parents turned to home-schooling.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Continue reading the main story](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/us/christian-schools-growth.html#after-story-ad-2)\n\nOthers wanted or needed to have their children in physical classrooms. In many parts of the country, private schools stayed open even as public schools moved largely online. Because many parents were working from home, they got a historically intimate look at their children’s online classes — leading to what some advocates for evangelical schools call “the Zoom factor.”\n\n“It’s not necessarily one thing,” said Melanie Cassady, director of academy relations at Christian Heritage Academy in Rocky Mount, Va., about 25 miles southwest of Smith Mountain Lake Christian Academy. “It’s that overall awareness that the pandemic has really brought to light to families of what’s going on inside the schools, inside the classroom, and what teachers are teaching. They’ve come to that point where they have to make a decision: Am I OK with this?”\n\nChristian Heritage Academy had 185 students at the end of the last school year, and 323 this fall. Blueprints for a $10 million expansion project now hang in the school’s entryway.\n\n“It has been absolutely shocking,” said Jeff Keaton, the founder and president of RenewaNation, a Virginia-based conservative evangelical organization whose work includes starting and consulting with evangelical schools. One of his brothers, Troy Keaton, is a pastor and the chair of the Smith Mountain Lake board.\n\n## Editors’ Picks\n\n### 14 Showstopping Desserts That Don’t Require a Mixer\n\n### I’m Jealous of My Friend’s Success.

Starting next summer, public-school teachers in the state will also be evaluated on their “cultural competency,” which includes factors like using teaching materials that “represent and validate diversity.” School districts have also grappled with new state guidelines this fall on transgender students’ access to bathrooms and locker rooms of their choice, and rights to use their preferred names and pronouns.\n\n“Of course we do not teach C.R.T.,” said Jon Atchue, a member of the school board in Franklin County, Va., adding that teaching about historical injustices is not the same thing as Marxism or critical race theory, which is an academic framework for analyzing historical patterns of racism and how they persist. “It’s a windmill that folks are fighting with.” Mr. Atchue emphasized that he was speaking only for himself, not the board.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Continue reading the main story](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/us/christian-schools-growth.html#after-story-ad-3)\n\nJeff Keaton called this period “the second Great Awakening in Christian education in the United States since the 1960s and ’70s.”\n\nThat previous “Great Awakening” was spurred by a number of factors, starting when white Southern parents founded “segregation academies” as a backlash to racial integration created by the Supreme Court’s 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. Other Supreme Court rulings on school prayer and evolution in the 1960s, debates about sex education, desegregation busing, and fears of “secular humanism” in the 1970s contributed to the alienation of many white conservatives.\n\nBefore the pandemic, private school enrollment overall had declined gradually since the turn of the millennium, while the subset of non-Catholic religious schools held steady, suggesting that the recent growth in conservative evangelical schools is a distinct phenomenon rather than part of a general retreat from public schools.\n\nToday, some schools — generally newer and smaller — advertise themselves directly as standing athwart history. “Critical Race Theory will not be included in our curriculum or teaching,” promises a new school opened by a large church in Lawrence, Kan. “The idea of gender fluidity has no place in our churches, schools or homes,” the headmaster of another new school in Maricopa, Ariz., writes on his school’s website.\n\nBut most schools do not make such overt references. “They use words like alternative or Christian or traditional*,*” said Adam Laats, a historian at Binghamton University.\n\nAcademic quality and costs vary widely, with some schools led by people without educational credentials and others touting more rigorous standards than public schools. Smith Mountain Lake uses curriculum from Bob Jones University Press, which says it offers “Christian educational materials with academic excellence from a biblical worldview.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Continue reading the main story](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/us/christian-schools-growth.html#after-story-ad-4)\n\nMore significant, said Mr. Laats, are the words that conservative schools do not use, like “inclusion” and “diversity,” in contrast with a growing number of public and private schools. About 68 percent of students at conservative Christian private schools are white, according to the Education Department, a figure that is comparable to other categories of private schools but significantly higher than public schools.\n\nImage\n\nSmith Mountain Lake students flipped through last year’s yearbook while gathered around a cafeteria table.Credit...Veasey Conway for The New York Times\n\nConservatives reject comparisons between their opposition to critical race theory and the desegregation backlash of the last century. “I don’t know a single school that even comes close to promoting that kind of concept,” Jeff Keaton said. “What they don’t like is critical theory, where they pit kids against each other in oppressed and oppressor groups*.”*\n\nIf many conservative Protestant schools in the 1960s and 1970s were founded to keep white children away from certain people, then the goal today is keeping children away from certain ideas, said J. Russell Hawkins, a professor of humanities and history at Indiana Wesleyan University. “But the ideas being avoided are still having to do with race,” he said.\n\nSkepticism of public education is a long-running theme in American conservatism. But the specter of critical race theory is now a constant topic on conservative talk radio and television news. In a speech in May, former Attorney General William P. Barr referred to public schools as “the government’s secular-progressive madrassas.”\n\nLike many Christian schools across the country, Smith Mountain Lake has benefited not just from national controversies but intense local battles. A school board meeting in July in Franklin County, Va., from which the school draws many of its students, attracted about 180 community members for a heated discussion of critical race theory and masking in schools. Smith Mountain Lake does not require masks.\n\nIn Franklin County, public school enrollment has dropped to 6,125 this year from 7,270 in 2017-18. Over the same period, the number of home-schooled students in the district almost doubled to 1,010, including 32 students who withdrew after a new mask mandate was put into place in mid-September.\n\nAlthough the district does not count the number of students in other schools, Kara Bernard, the district’s home-school coordinator, said, “We are losing students to private Christian schools.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Continue reading the main story](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/us/christian-schools-growth.html#after-story-ad-5)\n\nDeana Wright enrolled her children in Smith Mountain Lake in July, soon after speaking at a school board meeting in Franklin County. She and her husband did not want their children to keep wearing masks in school, and she had also started reading about what her district was teaching about race. She was “shocked” to come across terms like “cultural competency” and “educational equity” — euphemisms, as she saw it, for critical race theory.\n\n“We’re just so grateful that the Christian academy is here,” she said.\n\nSome teachers are grateful, too.\n\nImage\n\nShelley Kist, a Spanish teacher at Smith Mountain Lake, left the public school system after 17 years.Credit...Veasey Conway for The New York Times\n\nShelley Kist, who is in her first year teaching Spanish at Smith Mountain Lake, took a pay cut to come to the school after 17 years in public schools.\n\nIn her classes at the Christian school, she leads students in prayers in Spanish, assigns Bible verses they must memorize in Spanish, and discusses career opportunities in overseas missionary work. And she is comfortable weaving cultural commentary into her lessons. She recently made a connection in class between the fact that each Spanish noun is assigned a gender and the concept of “God’s assigned genders” for men and women.\n\nThe question for private schools is whether growth in reaction to a pandemic and a culture war is sustainable after concerns about both have receded. “This will be a blip in some places,” Troy Keaton, the chairman of Smith Mountain Lake’s board, conceded while seated at a conference table at his church. “But this is a long-term opportunity for people that know how to love, care, teach and do high-quality things.”\n\nAt the school, just over the hill from his church, a student band had led a contemporary worship song at the chapel service that morning: “I won’t bow to idols,” the students sang. “I’ll stand strong and worship you.”", "timestamp": 1635062217, "digest": "dBOL8rGgRieKVEyYlVadDuYzfBNybp9eLJnSFxtr0U4", "contributor": "0x953ef2b42A44aEF445c93691F4C90c61b8173D62"}

If you consider Manchin’s positions beyond his votes, however, he has sometimes been at odds with Biden, other Senate Democrats, or both.\n\nA perfect 100% of Manchin’s votes align with Biden and the Democrats, according to the website [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/joe-manchin/). That included razor-thin party-line votes on a $3.5 trillion budget resolution (50-49), expanding voting rights (50-50) and $1.9 trillion for COVID-19 relief (50-49).\n\nHowever, Manchin, along with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., opposes changing the Senate’s filibuster rule that allows a minority of 41 senators to block a bill with little effort. That position has stymied top Democratic priorities, including strengthening the federal role in overseeing elections.\n\nManchin and Sinema have also balked at the full price tag of the Democratic reconciliation bill that includes many of Biden’s top agenda priorities. Manchin’s negotiating leverage will likely force Democrats to settle for a much smaller bill than many in the party had sought, including Biden.", "timestamp": 1635062018, "digest": "A16UqIBvXTOmck6njWzQaMsExtovhoe2KbInKtwl9eI", "contributor": "0x6140E4c4b50f53D4a2621DF028b75Ce94f88De5b"}

The [memo ](https://twitter.com/oliverdarcy/status/1437844301103390726?lang=en)stated that Fox News would soon start daily testing for the small share of employees who were unvaccinated or didn’t provide proof of vaccination. \n\nThe Fox News policy goes further than the policy for private businesses that Biden called for in September. \n\n\"I’m announcing that the Department of Labor is developing an emergency rule to require all employers with 100 or more employees, that together employ over 80 million workers, to ensure their work forces are fully vaccinated or show a negative test at least once a week,\" [Biden said at the time](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/09/us/politics/biden-vaccine-mandates-transcript.html). \n\nThe phrase \"vaccine mandate\" is \"not a legal term of art and has no legal definition,\" said Rachel Arnow-Richman, a University of Florida employment law professor.\n\nFox News’ policy for its workers stands in contrast to the falsehoods spread by some of their hosts and guests. Tucker Carlson made [misleading](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/may/06/tucker-carlson/tucker-carlsons-misleading-claim-about-deaths-afte/) statements about death reports following vaccination and claimed the vaccines might not work, which we rated [Pants on Fire](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/apr/15/tucker-carlson/tucker-carlson-falsely-claims-covid-19-vaccines-mi/).

And the reason it did, is because we had a significant number of police.\"\n\nBiden has been making this claim for years, but criminal justice experts consider it exaggerated.\n\nWe first [fact-checked](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2007/nov/02/joe-biden/call-the-exaggeration-police/) Biden on this issue in 2007, when he was running for president. He was touting the 1994 crime bill, which he championed as a senator.\n\nThe Community Oriented Police Services, or COPS, was part of that legislation and added tens of thousands of police officers on the streets from 1994 through 2000.\n\nBut several government and independent studies did not find a strong link between COPS and a 32% drop in violent crime from 1993 to 2001. \n\nFor example, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said \"COPS grants were not the major cause of the decline in crime from 1994 through 2001,\" and a peer-reviewed study published in the journal Criminology found that \"COPS spending had little to no effect on crime.\"\n\nFactCheck.org checked a 2019 Biden claim that the crime bill cut violent crime in half. Our colleagues [found](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/07/biden-on-the-1994-crime-bill/) that the violent crime rate dropped 46% from 1994 to 2017, but that it was misleading to credit the crime bill. Experts pointed to a variety of other factors for most of that decrease, such as changes in demographics, the economy and health.\n\nWe have seen the \"greatest assault on voting rights in the history of the United States, for real, since the Civil War.\"\n\nThis is an exaggeration and ignores major voter suppression efforts during the 20th century.\n\nFollowing Democratic victories in November 2020, GOP state lawmakers proposed hundreds of bills that included restrictions on voting. Some of these bills ultimately made it into law and include limits on the use of [absentee drop boxes](https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/may/19/ballot-drop-boxes-were-popular-2020-then-they-beca/), [bans ](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/mar/29/josh-holmes/facts-about-georgias-ban-food-water-giveaways-vote/)on certain food or water giveaways to voters in line or a  [shorter early voting period](https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/jun/21/iowas-newest-election-laws-explained/). \n\nThe new restrictions are an additional hurdle for some voters, but it’s not the same as the Jim Crow restrictions in the pre-1960s South that kept Blacks segregated and politically powerless.\n\nThe methods that limited Black participation included [poll taxes](https://www.britannica.com/topic/poll-tax), [complicated](https://www.ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/question/2012/pdfs-docs/literacytest.pdf) [literacy tests](https://www.thirteen.org/wnet/jimcrow/voting_literacy.html) and \"[grandfather clauses](https://www.britannica.com/topic/grandfather-clause).\" Many of the laws effectively exempted whites from such requirements even as they blocked Blacks from voting.\n\nIt has been a common talking point on the left to refer to the new restrictions as a resurgence of Jim Crow. Some experts see the comparisons as justified, saying it highlights the dangers of backsliding from hard-won voting rights. \n\nAndra Gillespie, an Emory University political scientist and expert on African American politics, [previously told us](https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/apr/30/georgia-election-law-comparable-jim-crow-democrats/) \"it’s convenient\" for Republicans to say they’re not enacting literacy tests or requiring prospective voters to count soap bubbles before they cast a ballot. But she said that’s a low bar.\n\nOther experts told us that the comparison is overblown.\n\n\"While I have some issues with restrictive voting laws despite my personal center-right perspective, comparing the requirement that voters show a $5 plastic ID at the polls and bring their own water, to historical oppression or race war seems simply bizarre,\" Wilfred Reilly, a political scientist at Kentucky State University, a historically Black university, previously told us. \n\n\"You have 55 corporations, for example, in the United States of America making over $40 billion, don't pay a cent.

The Chinese detained the U.S. crew for 11 days and carefully inspected the sophisticated aircraft before they handed it over. Washington accused the Chinese fighter pilot of reckless flying. Beijing demanded an apology.\n\nThe incident reinforced the Bush administration's view that [China](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/would-biden-get-tough-china-n1239203) was America's next major adversary.\n\nBut on the morning of Sept. 11, Al Qaeda extremists hijacked four airliners and crashed three of them into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Virginia. America's attention abruptly shifted to the \"war on terror.\"\n\nU.S. troops deployed to Afghanistan and the Middle East, and the challenge posed by China was set aside for nearly two decades.\n\n## Tensions mount between China and Taiwan\n\nOCT. 11, 202101:39\n\n\"It was [an incredible geopolitical gift to China](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/china-s-growing-firepower-casts-doubt-whether-u-s-could-n1262148),\" said Kishore Mahbubani, Singapore's former U.N. ambassador.\n\n\"It was a huge mistake for the United States to focus on the war on terror, because the real challenge was going to come from China,\" said Mahbubani, a distinguished fellow at the National University of Singapore.\n\nChina's gross domestic product [jumped](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263770/gross-domestic-product-gdp-of-china/) from $1.2 trillion in 2000 to more than $14.7 trillion in 2020.\n\n\"While you were busy fighting wars, China was busy trading,\" said Mahbubani, the author of \"Has China Won?\"\n\nAs the U.S. was bogged down fighting Islamist militants in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere, China's economic and military power grew exponentially. Beijing built up its missile arsenal, extended its reach in the South China Sea by constructing artificial islands, stole intellectual property on a massive scale and pursued predatory trade tactics, experts say.\n\n\"After 9/11, China very quickly realized that Washington's strategic focus would be shifting 3,000 miles away, away from the East China Sea, away from the Taiwan Strait and into Afghanistan,\" said Craig Singleton of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank. \"It was an opportunity to quietly develop very coercive military capabilities that were all designed and intended to expand its power in East Asia.\"\n\n## China strikes defiant tone as Communist Party celebrates centenary\n\nJULY 1, 202101:25\n\nJames Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank, said that the 9/11 attacks did not alter China's goals but that they created the chance to close the gap with a rival distracted by the \"war on terror.\"\n\n\"They were doing the same things all along, and we slowed down,\" he said. U.S. officials at the time assumed that \"we could put the China problem on the back burner while we brought democracy to Iraq and Afghanistan,\" said Lewis, who worked on national security issues in several administrations.\n\nThe U.S. spent an estimated $8 trillion on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and on other fronts in the fight against terrorism, according to a report by the Costs of War Project at Brown University.\n\nLewis said the money could have been spent on research and development, modernizing the country's infrastructure, building high-tech weapons \"and all the things we could have done over the past 20 years.\"\n\n## Preparing for the wrong adversary\n\nWhile China ratcheted up defense spending on ship-killing missiles in the western Pacific and expanded its navy, the Pentagon revamped the Army to take on insurgents in the Middle East armed with AK-47s, and the Air Force grew accustomed to operating with total air superiority.\n\n\"We gave them 20 years, and we retooled our military for a fight totally irrelevant to the principal security challenge of today,\" said[ Evan Medeiros](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/0033600001FP3ogAAD/evan-medeiros), the Penner Family Chair in Asia Studies at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service.\n\nAfter the 9/11 attacks, the Bush administration reversed course with China to gain its support at the U.N. Security Council for the fight against Al Qaeda, easing pressure on Beijing over human rights and pressing Taiwan to hold off on an independence referendum. At Beijing's request, in 2002 the U.S. declared an obscure Uyghur organization, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, to be a terrorist group.\n\n## Biden announces defense pact with Australia and U.K. in effort to push back on China\n\nSEPT. 17, 202104:00\n\nThe move, and the rhetoric surrounding the fight against terrorism, gave China a justification to crack down on Muslims in China, experts said.\n\n### Recommended\n\n### ELECTIONS\n\n### POLITICS NEWS\n\nBy the time Barack Obama entered the White House in 2009, officials spoke of the need to \"pivot\" to Asia and focus more on countering China. But a faltering war effort in Afghanistan and turmoil in the Middle East kept drawing Washington's attention away from China.\n\nIt is difficult to say how things would have evolved without the 9/11 attacks, but some experts argue that the U.S. might have adapted its defense and economic strategies years earlier to take China's rise into account.\n\n\"Absent 9/11, you potentially would have had a faster shift in U.S. strategy towards China, in a more competitive direction,\" said Medeiros, who was Obama's top adviser on the Asia-Pacific region. \"At a minimum, you would have had a faster shift in U.S. defense strategy.\"", "timestamp": 1635062323, "digest": "YedTwlxrS0d70AHs-PvV-DY2Ly8hf2-8U8G6JDSEfPk", "contributor": "0x373790EdA0055A7b9265257aD21d6990A6C6aC4c"}
{"id": "zFRw3eT6NdU8_Jd7YDAhsBrUOYJCSMyqDDWJJCA7dXU", "title": "Michael Caine on Brexit, Boris Johnson and big breaks: ‘I’ve done 150 movies. I think that’s enough’", "body": "Michael Caine is 88 and walks with a stick. He has a gammy leg and a dodgy spine and reckons the only time he leaves the house these days is when his wife has the time to take him out for a drive. The other week he was sent a screenplay that had his character running away from a bunch of crooks, and this made him laugh – the very idea he could play it. “I can’t walk, let alone run,” he says. “And I’m more or less done with movies now.”\n\nHe was winding down anyway, hadn’t shot a film in a year, and then sneaked in one last movie, Best Sellers, just before the pandemic struck. He doubts he will ever make another, which is fine by him, no great loss. He’s got his knighthood and his Oscars; what does he have left to prove? He says: “I’ve done 150 movies. I think I’ve done enough.”\n\nCaine has been such a reliable fixture for so long – part of the furniture, a familiar face on the screen – that it’s unnerving to imagine the landscape without him, like walking into the Tower of London and finding the ravens all gone. It’s more unnerving still to realise that it may already have happened; that he might have retired without anyone making a fuss. Caine spent the first part of his career storming the barricades and the second enjoying the spoils of his success. One would have expected some big final act, a showstopping swan song. Instead, we have this: a clean getaway.\n\nThe actor is speaking via video link from his Surrey home near Box Hill (the first time, he says, he has done an interview this way). He’s supposed to be promoting his role in Best Sellers, an amiable enough enterprise that casts him as a dyspeptic old author who becomes a viral sensation. But the man’s not feeling it; he seems to have moved on. When I tell him I’ve heard he based the character of Harris Shaw on a monstrous old director he once worked with, he pleads total ignorance and says he can’t think who I mean. “I don’t remember. I might have done. It’s been two years since I did it, so it’s funny talking about it now.” He slurps his tea. “Also, I’m 88. My mind’s not as agile as it used to be.”\n\nA swansong? Caine with Aubrey Plaza in Best Sellers. Photograph: Screen Media Films/Allstar\n\nYou see, he adds, that’s another thing to consider. “I mean, I’m fine, I’m well. But I can’t walk and I can’t stand for very long and now I don’t know whether my bloody memory’s going. And I’ve worked with people like that. I worked with one actor who had all his bloody lines written on the wall because he never remembered any of them. And there are others who wear earphones and have the assistant director read the next line to them. Johnny Depp – he does that \\[Depp, [for his part, has suggested otherwise](https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/johnny-depp-defends-acting-with-an-earpiece.html)\\]. I can’t remember who the other bloke was. Older American actor. It was a long time ago now.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen lockdown happened, Caine was faced with a choice. He could either lounge about in the house and watch telly all day or he could add a fresh string to his bow. So he sat and wrote a novel, a thriller, his first stab at straight fiction after a number of memoirs. Fingers crossed, he’s getting it published next year, although he’s still rewriting and tidying, making it look more professional, “Paragraphs,” he says, chuckling. “Punctuation, all that.”\n\nWhat’s the title and what’s it about? “Well,” he says. “The title is If You Don’t Want to Die. I only read thrillers. I’m an adventure man, I’m not a literature person, so I’m not trying to replace Shakespeare here. But it’s based on something I once read about two dustmen, two rubbish collectors in the East End.” Dramatic pause. “And they find uranium in the rubbish.”\n\nAs a boy in south London, his twin passions were always movies and books, the cinema and the library. He’s done cinema to death, so it’s only fitting that he should now be circling back to the library, albeit metaphorically – the actual building has long gone. The last time he visited Elephant and Castle he saw it had been replaced by a block of flats. But that’s progress, that’s history. It involves good changes and bad. When he was starting out as an actor, for instance, British film and theatre were the preserve of the posh. “It was: ‘Bunty’s having a party and everyone’s in their tennis whites.’” Another short laugh. “Then we came along and we changed all that.”\n\nGet Carter. Photograph: Silver Screen Collection/Metro/Allstar\n\nThese days we view Caine’s early career in sweeping historical terms. He was the ordinary bloke with the alleycat swagger, the working-class hero with the undiluted Thames accent, a bespectacled poster-boy for 60s social mobility. He has now reached the point where he’s started to view himself in those terms, as part of an upstart generation of actors that included Albert Finney, Richard Harris, Peter O’Toole and Tom Courtenay. Whereas at the time, of course, he was living his life in closeup; no perspective whatsoever. “I was just in the disco, pissed,” he says. “I didn’t know what the hell was going on.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSometimes, channel surfing, he’ll catch a glimpse of an antique Caine classic. It might be him playing deadpan Harry Palmer in The Ipcress File, hardcase Jack in Get Carter, or rollicking, ill-starred Peachy Carnehan in The Man Who Would Be King. But he says he has no interest in revisiting old glories and can rarely be persuaded to look back at his work. He reckons that Alfie was probably the best film he made, but he’s basing that on memory and hasn’t updated the files. “I’ve only watched Alfie maybe two or three times.”\n\nWhat he misses, if anything, are the people, not the films. The films are there on his iPad any time he wants to watch them. But his mates have absconded; they’ve made their getaways, too. “My generation is going. All my friends are dying off. Because we all got so old. Roger Moore, Sean Connery – those are two of my closest friends who went. Then a couple of days ago, [Johnny Gold](https://www.tatler.com/article/johnny-gold-the-legendary-founder-of-tramp-nightclub-has-died-aged-89), who owned Tramp, the discotheque in London. And I have another very close friend who is very, very ill. If he survives until next weekend I’ll be surprised. And I won’t mention his name, but you’ll read about him in the papers.”\n\nI ask if he thinks the country is in a better shape today than when he started out, or whether the social progress he epitomised has since been rolled back. “I don’t know,” he says. “It’s still not perfect. Probably never will be. Look at the state we’re in now. If you’re growing up today you’re in for a tough time.”\n\nIn the past, Caine has variously described himself as a leftwing Tory and a rightwing socialist. He traditionally (but not exclusively) votes Conservative. He adored Margaret Thatcher, respected David Cameron and [voted leave in the 2016 referendum](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/06/michael-caine-voted-brexit-eu-freedom-not-immigrants-going-in-style-new-film). One day, I suggest, he’s going to reconsider that position, but he’s having none of it. He still fully supports Brexit, despite the current supply-chain chaos, despite the burgeoning winter-fuel crisis.\n\nWith Sue Lloyd in The Ipcress File. Photograph: Rank/Sportsphoto/Allstar\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Oh, that’s teething trouble,” he assures me. “It’s obviously not going to go well immediately.” Then he slightly shifts position. “I mean, I don’t know what’s going to happen. I’ve got to wait for Boris to come back off holiday. I mean, to do that, to go on holiday right now, it’s unbelievable. Empty shelves. People queueing for petrol. And you think: ‘Wait a minute. He’s [gone to Marbella](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/11/no-10-defends-boris-johnson-holiday-in-spain-amid-energy-crisis)?’”\n\nSo wait – he thinks Brexit is good, but he’s unimpressed with Johnson personally? “Oh, I supported him. I thought he was great. But now I’m very disappointed in him. He made a big mistake there, going to Marbella. Let’s see if when he comes back he can settle it all. Otherwise we might have a socialist government.”\n\nAnd he might be voting for it? “Might be. You never know. I did it before. I did it with Blair. I did it with someone else. I forget who – it was a long time ago. I always vote according to what I think. What’s good for us. What’s good for the country.”\n\nHe is, I suspect, your classic working-class Tory – raised in poverty, a self-made man. This perhaps partly explains the mass of substandard pictures that clog up his CV – quick-cash gigs such as The Swarm and The Hand and Jaws: The Revenge, which he was off shooting the night he [won an Oscar for Hannah and Her Sisters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JauxWp4eWnM) in 1987. If you’ve been brought up poor, money must matter more. You want to amass it. You want to keep it. Maybe he feels that there’s somehow still a lack.\n\n“No, no, no,” Caine objects. He doesn’t think that at all. He’s flush with cash, awash with cash. “I’ve always lived to the highest limit that my money would allow. I mean, I’m not extravagant. I’m not silly. I’m not out buying caviar every day. But yeah, I’m talking to you from a great big house with 24 acres of land. Which is fantastic because it means that my grandchildren can come and visit, and they disappear instantly and just go running around. Two miles, running round and round the garden.”\n\nOnce again, he checks himself. Here he is waxing lyrical about his house in the country, when the reality is that the place has now run its course. He bought it 30-odd years ago as a big family home, large enough to accommodate him, his second wife, Shakira, his two daughters and three grandchildren. These days it’s mostly just him and Shakira, rattling around. “So I’m going to get a smaller one,” he says. “Because the grandchildren have all gone now. They’re all growing up. So I’m going to move back to be nearer to them, where it’s easier for them to visit. I’m going to move to Wimbledon. My daughter, Natasha, lives in Wimbledon.”\n\nHe was named Maurice Micklewhite, after his father, who worked as a fish market porter. I’ve read that he only officially changed it a few years ago, because he got sick of having to explain himself every time he lined up at UK passport control. But he says that’s not true: he changed it ages ago, 10 years back at least. It felt like cutting the last link with his past.\n\nWith Shelley Winters in Alfie. Photograph: Paramount/Allstar\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he first became Michael Caine, of course, people still called him Maurice. “But I haven’t got any family members now, so no one’s called me Maurice for years. Everyone’s dead. My brother, my mother, my father. If I have any other relations, they’d be living in Bermondsey.” He shrugs. “And I don’t go to Bermondsey.”\n\nWhat about him? Is he still Maurice deep down? “No. The day I became Michael Caine, that was it – I was Michael Caine. I wasn’t Maurice any more, I was a completely different person. And it was amazing. It was fabulous.”\n\nWhat was wrong with Maurice? “Well, nobody knew him. He was broke. He was out of work. And the moment I became Michael Caine, I got a job and was on my way.”\n\nHe swings with practised ease into an anecdote he has probably told 100 times before – at dinner parties, in discotheques and on prime-time chatshows to rolling audience applause. It’s the tale of how he got his big break in the 1964 film [Zulu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SCpAiWLU-g). How he met the American director Cy Endfield in the theatre bar only to be told that the part he wanted had already gone to another actor. How he had thought that was that. Back to penury and obscurity. Back to being Maurice Micklewhite.\n\nHe says: “My entire movie career is based on the length of the bar at the Prince of Wales theatre, because I was on my way out and it was a very long walk to the door. And I had just got there, when he called out: ‘Come back!’ because he had decided that I could play the part of the officer instead. He said: ‘You look like an officer,’ because I was 6ft 2in, blond hair, very slim. The door was half-open; I was very nearly through it. I turned around and walked back in.”\n\nHis story makes me think of Dick Whittington, turning again on the road into London. “Exactly,” says Caine. “That’s exactly who I am: the Dick Whittington of acting.”\n\n*Best Sellers is available digitally on 18 October and screens on 27 October at the Raindance film festival.*", "timestamp": 1635062164, "digest": "7HvdwvFcI2NSrppqsTlvZ07lJCmUWUVReMvUv4Gcy-w", "contributor": "0x3dD2445439d0e0b486114E6168109d8644d9C712"}

Most are too offensive to share unedited. The trigger? My coverage of the impact of online conspiracies and fake news. I expect to be challenged and criticised - but misogynistic hate directed at me has become a very regular occurrence.\n\nMessages are laden with slurs based on gender, and references to rape, beheading and sexual acts. Some are a mish-mash of conspiracy theories - that I'm \"Zionist-controlled\", that I, myself, am responsible for raping babies. The C-word and F-word are repeatedly used.\n\nIt's not just me - from politicians around the world and Love Island stars to frontline doctors, I've been hearing from women subjected to the same kind of hate.

So, I set out to make a film for the BBC's Panorama programme.\n\nWe set up a fake troll account across the five most popular social media platforms to see whether they are promoting misogynistic hate to such users. Using an AI-generated photograph, we designed our fake troll to be similar to the people who sent me abuse. Our troll engaged with content recommended by the social media platforms, but did not send out any hate.\n\nAs part of the programme, think-tank Demos carried out a comprehensive deep dive into abuse received by reality TV contestants, analysing more than 90,000 posts and comments about them. It was perhaps a surprising place to start, but programmes like Love Island serve almost as a microcosm for society, allowing researchers to compare the abuse directed at men and women from different backgrounds. Their popularity also generates a lot of online conversation.\n\nIMAGE SOURCE,ITV\n\nImage caption,Love Island contestants 2021\n\nWe discovered:\n\n* Our troll account was recommended more and more anti-women content by Facebook and Instagram, some involving sexual violence.\n* Female reality TV contestants - including those on this year's Love Island - are disproportionately targeted on social media, with abuse frequently rooted in misogyny and combined with racism.\n* Draft proposals for the UN asking social media companies to better protect women have been shared exclusively with Panorama.\n\n## Abusive accounts untouched\n\nSocial media companies say they take online hate against women seriously - and they have rules to protect users from abuse. These include suspending, restricting or even shutting down accounts sending hate.\n\nBut my experience suggests they often don't. I reported some of the worst messages I've ever received - including threats to come to my house to rape me and commit horrific sexual acts - to Facebook when I received them. But months later, the account remained on Facebook, along with dozens of other Instagram and Twitter accounts sending me abuse.\n\nIt turns out my experience is part of a pattern. New research for this programme by the Centre for Countering Digital Hate, shows how 97% of 330 accounts sending misogynistic abuse on Twitter and Instagram remained on the site after being reported.\n\nTwitter and Instagram say they take action when their rules are violated, and closing accounts isn't the only option.\n\n**Find out more**\n\nWatch Marianna Spring's Panorama - Online abuse: Why Do You Hate Me? on the [BBC iPlayer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b006t14n/panorama) (UK only)\n\n## Troll hunting\n\nCurious about who was running accounts sending me - and other women - abuse, I started by looking into the profiles targeting me. Most were men and based in the UK. Everything from calling me a \"daft cow\" and telling me I needed to \"get laid\" to threatening to come and find me and violently or sexually attack me, they bombard me with gender-based slurs again and again.\n\nIt turns out, they are real people - not bots. One is a Spurs fan, like me. Another likes vegan cooking. One, whose account was anonymous, even gave away his location by tweeting at delivery service Ocado complaining it didn't deliver to his postcode in Great Yarmouth.\n\nI reached out to them - and one called Steve, a van driver in his 60s from the Midlands, agreed to speak to me on the phone. The messages he'd sent me were less offensive than most of the abuse I receive - mainly gender-based slurs.\n\nLike lots of account holders who sent me hate, he is deep into online conspiracy theories. But like others, the abuse he sent me also attacked me for being a woman. At first he told me he didn't think his messages were that bad - but I explained they were just some of many punctuated with abuse streaming into my inbox.\n\n\"I probably made a mistake. I'm a pretty fair bloke,\" he eventually concluded.\n\nHe pointed out that he actually receives hate himself online from \"people who believe in global warming and that 9/11 happened\". They are responding to conspiracy theories that he shares on social media. I had hoped this might help him see why hate wasn't the answer. And I think by the end of our conversation he was coming around to the idea.\n\nImage caption,Marianna tries to find out more about the people sending you abuse\n\nOur conversation got me thinking about what my trolls might be seeing on their social media feeds. I wanted to see whether social media algorithms are pushing more misogyny to accounts similar to those that abuse women online. So I created a fake online persona called Barry and signed him up to the five most popular social media platforms in the UK.\n\nAll the main social media companies say they don't promote hate on their platforms and take action to stop it. They each have algorithms that offer us content based on things we've posted, liked or watched in the past. But it's difficult to know what they push to each user.\n\n\"One of the only ways to do this is to manually create a profile and seeing the kind of rabbit hole that it might be led down by the platform itself, once you start to follow certain groups or pages,\" explains social media expert Chloe Colliver, who advised me on the experiment.\n\nShe works for the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, looking into extremism and disinformation on social media. She has helped journalists before, and advises me on how I can set up the profiles in an ethical and realistic way - only doing what's necessary to test the algorithms.\n\nBarry's accounts were based on multiple accounts that had sent me abuse. Like my trolls, Barry was mainly interested in anti-vax content and conspiracy theories, and followed a small amount of anti-women content. He also posted some abuse on his profile - so that the algorithms could detect from the start he had an account that used abusive language about women. But unlike my trolls, he didn't message any women directly.\n\nOver two weeks, I logged in every couple of days and followed recommendations, posted to Barry's profiles, liked posts and watched videos.\n\nAfter just a week, the top recommended pages to follow on both Facebook and Instagram were almost all misogynistic. By the end of the experiment, Barry was pushed more and more anti-women content by these sites - a dramatic increase from when the account had been created. Some of this content involved sexual violence, sharing disturbing memes about sex acts, and content condoning rape, harassment and gendered violence.\n\nThey also referenced extreme ideologies. That included the \"incel\" movement - an internet subculture that encourages men to blame women for problems in their lives. It's been linked to several acts of violence, including [recent shootings in Plymouth](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-44053828), in the UK.\n\n\"If it were a real person, \\[Barry\\] would have been brought into a hateful community full of misogynistic content very, very quickly - within two weeks,\" says Colliver.\n\nFar from stopping Barry engaging with anti-women content, Facebook and Instagram appear to have promoted it to him. By contrast, there was no anti-women content on TikTok and very little on Twitter. YouTube suggested some videos hostile to women.\n\n* [Government lays out plans to protect users online](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-57071977)\n* [Facebook whistleblower reveals identity](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-58784615)\n\nFacebook, which also owns Instagram, says it tries not to recommend content that breaks its rules and is improving its technology \"to find and remove abuse more quickly\".\n\nYouTube says it has \"strict policies\" on hate and \"quickly\" removes content that breaks its rules.\n\nThat wasn't the only thing in the experiment that struck me. Barry's main interest was originally conspiracy theories and I had expected him to be inundated with that sort of content at the start. But he wasn't.\n\nSocial media sites have come under increasing pressure not to promote misleading information about vaccines and the pandemic. But why hasn't that happened with misogynistic content on Facebook and Instagram?\n\n\"They are driving up their bottom line by keeping people's interest in horrible, violent, often misogynistic content,\" says Colliver.\n\nNearly three billion people worldwide use Facebook - and last year it made on average $32 (£23) in advertising revenue per user. The longer people stay on the platform, the more ads it sells and the more money the tech giant makes.\n\nFacebook says \"protecting\" its community is \"more important than maximising profits\".\n\nIt has announced new measures to tackle sexualised hate targeting journalists, politicians and celebrities on its sites.", "timestamp": 1635062416, "digest": "grpUQgAReDIgz2Ja_CYQae79SN1l08CpIbHPExLe4CE", "contributor": "0xa5A313A41968f058EF5C36ddC1891B51fF57caAD"}

They found that female reality TV contestants are disproportionately targeted on social media with abuse frequently rooted in misogyny and combined with racism.\n\nWhile the contestants received mostly positive messages, fashion blogger Kaz Kamwi, 26, and 23-year-old medical student Priya Gopaldas, told Panorama they also got some disturbing hate-filled messages.\n\n\"The most difficult abuse to receive is any that is racially motivated. When you look at me, I am a dark skinned black woman, that's the first thing you see,\" says Kaz. \"And the fact that my family was exposed to that breaks my heart.\"\n\nEllen Judson, who led the research for Demos and focuses on social media policy, says reality TV is a great place to start looking at online hate because the genre is so popular with people expressing who they like or don't like.\n\n\"We also see that the contestants are a relatively equal mix of men and women - and from lots of different backgrounds - so it gives us an opportunity to analyse those differences in how the public are responding to them.\"\n\nDemos looked at more than 90,000 online messages about Love Island and Married at First Sight contestants:\n\n* On Twitter, 26% of posts about females were abusive versus 14% of those directed at men\n* Abuse targeting women focused primarily on gender and sex (much more so than men), with messages littered with gender-based tropes and talk of sex acts\n* Hate intensified when combined with racist language directed at black and Asian female contestants\n\n\"People were using explicitly gendered slurs - women being manipulative, women being sneaky, being sexual, women being evil or stupid. Whereas what we saw with men was them being attacked for seemingly not being masculine enough - for being too weak,\" says Judson. \"We also see that women of colour are receiving more pernicious attacks as well based on their race.\"\n\n* [Love Island star got death threat from 13-year-old](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-58558394)\n\nI wanted to see what impact this kind of abuse is having, so I spoke to politicians and frontline doctors who use social media to do their jobs. Like me they don't mind being criticised but they do mind when it gets personal.\n\nGetty Images\n\n> The attacks have been about my politics, my physical appearance and a lot about the fact I am gay\n>\n> **Ruth Davidson** \n Former leader of the Scottish Conservatives'\n\nFormer leader of the Scottish Conservatives Ruth Davidson fears that abuse targeting women online could turn back the clock when it comes to equality offline.\n\n\"The attacks that have come directly to me have been about my politics, some about my physical appearance, a lot has been about the fact that I am gay and a lot of it has been about the fact that I am a woman who has opinions.\"\n\nThere's also concern that online abuse could lead to real world harm.\n\n\"You look at your phone and you read somebody who is telling you as an NHS doctor that they want to rape you until you need one of your own ventilators,\" explains Dr Rachel Clarke, a frontline medic based in Oxford. She's been treating Covid patients during the pandemic and sees using social media as an extension of her duty as a doctor.\n\nIMAGE SOURCE,ADRIAN POLGLASE/BBC\n\nImage caption,Dr Rachel Clarke and Marianna Spring\n\nThat means she has frequently posted warnings about the impact of coronavirus - and encouraged her followers to have a Covid vaccine. It's those tweets in particular that often sparked a wave of misogynistic hate from anti-vaccine activists, not dissimilar to the accounts sending me hate.\n\n\"Male doctors that I know will receive abuse online as well. But the volume of abuse is much less. If you're a female doctor, it'll be much more visceral, and it will target you as a woman.\"\n\n## Offline violence\n\nI've been taking part in a major piece of research for the UN's cultural agency Unesco - which looks at the impact of online hate. Lead researcher Julie Posetti and her team asked more than 800 women, journalists like me, about their experiences of online hate.\n\nThey then studied some of the accounts, including mine and that of Nobel Peace Prize winner, Maria Ressa. She's an investigative journalist from the Philippines who gets lots of online abuse and says she wears a bullet-proof vest because she fears being attacked.\n\n\"Online violence is really the new frontier of conflict that women face internationally,\" Posetti tells me.\n\nTwenty per cent of women who responded to the UN's survey, in collaboration with the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ), said they had already experienced attacks in real-life, including stalking and physical assault.\n\nI'm especially worried about some of the hate I receive online, including from a man who appears to have a prior conviction for stalking women. But I've been left frustrated at the police response. After a wave of abuse at the end of April this year, I reported the most serious threats to the police, including about sexual violence. It's a criminal offence to send messages online that are grossly offensive or obscene in order to cause distress.\n\nAn officer got in touch initially and I shared my evidence of the abuse - but I only heard back from her weeks later when she told me that she was moving teams, my case was being passed on and there had been no progress. I wasn't contacted by a new liaison officer until July - when it became clear that the evidence I'd shared originally with the police had been lost, something that was later admitted.\n\nI tried to report another batch of rape threats, death threats and abusive messages at the end of July to the new officer. When we met in person in the middle of August, the officer admitted he was not the right person to handle the case - and that it should have been passed on to a specialist team. Yet more delays - and although the seriousness of the messages was acknowledged, there was little in the way of victim support.\n\nBy the end of August, I was on to my third police liaison officer - who asked me to review the portfolio of evidence I had already sent in, marking which messages were from Twitter, Instagram and Facebook as he wasn't sure how to use the platforms.\n\nMy latest liaison officer has requested more information from the social media sites - but still no progress.\n\nAccording to data from several police forces, which Panorama obtained through Freedom of Information requests, over the past five years the number of people reporting online hate has more than doubled. But over the same period, there's only been a 32% increase in the number of arrests. The victims are mainly women.\n\nThis is happening in the context of increasing pressure on the Met in particular to do more to tackle violence against women on our streets after the killings of Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa.\n\nI raised concerns that people sending me abuse might turn up at my work - but I was just told to call 999 if I felt in danger.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police say they take online hate very seriously and that my case is under active investigation.\n\nThe National Police Chiefs Council says the police take all reports of malicious communications seriously and will investigate but must prioritise its finite resources. It says it can take action other than making arrests.\n\n## The solutions?\n\nDraft proposals from the UN to get the social media companies to better protect women have been shared exclusively with Panorama. They are calling for social media platforms to introduce labels for accounts that have previously sent misogynistic abuse. They also want to see more human moderators taking the decisions about offensive material - and an early warning system for users if they think online abuse could escalate into real world harm.\n\n\"We would like to see gender-based online violence treated at least as seriously as disinformation has been during the pandemic by the platforms,\" explains Julie Posetti, who led the research that triggered these recommendations.\n\n\"I think we have to challenge,\" says Ruth Davidson. \"I don't think that it is in anybody's interests for women who are consistently abused in a way that a man wouldn't be to let other young women who are online and seeing that abuse think that's just the way things are.\"\n\nFor women of all ages - myself included - that means refusing to be bullied off social media.", "timestamp": 1635062459, "digest": "-fh27qXkaiBMKVGyyW1O9Dk1NWxuJMTWgKfqXyVdGPo", "contributor": "0xCfc76E86305228994324774C3Bdc98272a4700f3"}

Asked whether the U.S. would come to Taiwan’s defense if it were attacked, he replied: “Yes, we have a commitment to do that.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAsked Friday whether the U.S. would defend Taiwan if the island were attacked by China, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told a reporter he would not discuss hypothetical situations, but also said, “Nobody wants to see cross-Strait issues come to blows -– certainly not President Biden, and there’s no reason that it should.” Speaking in Brussels after a NATO defense ministers’ meeting, Austin added that Washington remains committed to its longstanding “one China” policy.\n\nIn Taipei, a spokesperson for independence-minded President Tsai Ing-wen said the U.S. has shown its support for Taiwan through concrete actions and the island’s 23 million citizens would not surrender to pressure or act rashly.\n\n“Taiwan will demonstrate our firm determination to defend ourselves and continue to work with countries with similar values to make a positive contribution toward the Taiwan Strait and Indo-Pacific region’s peace and stability,” spokesperson Chang Tun-han said.\n\nChina and Taiwan split during a civil war in 1949. The U.S. cut formal diplomatic relations with Taipei in 1979 in order to recognize Beijing. The U.S. does not openly contest China’s claim to Taiwan, but is committed by law to ensure the island can defend itself and to treat all threats toward it as matters of “grave concern.”\n\nUnder President Xi Jinping, who is also Communist Party leader and head of the armed forces, China has been stepping up military, diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan. Over its National Day weekend at the beginning of the month, China sent a record 149 military aircraft southwest of Taiwan in strike group formations, prompting Taiwan to scramble aircraft and activate its air defense missile systems.\n\nChina has also recently held beach landing exercises on its side of the roughly 160-kilometer (100-mile) -wide Taiwan Strait that, like the aircraft incursions, it described as a warning to Tsai’s administration.\n\nThe U.S. has reinforced its support for Taiwan with military sales. State Department spokesman Ned Price said this month that American support for Taiwan is “rock solid.” The U.S. has “also been very clear that we are committed to deepening our ties with Taiwan,” Price said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Biden’s pick for ambassador to Beijing, Nicholas Burns, told lawmakers considering his nomination that Americans should “have confidence in our strength” when dealing with the rise of China, a nation he said the U.S. and its allies could manage.\n\nBurns echoed the Biden administration’s stand on cooperating with China where possible but condemning many of its actions, including its policies toward Taiwan and the semi-autonomous territory of Hong Kong, where it has virtually eliminated dissident voices through stiff legislation and arrests.\n\n___\n\nAP National Security Writer Robert Burns in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.", "timestamp": 1635062693, "digest": "CXl_eU6dG6LCOIZgm2xt4XJL7ko8KctreJ8rpIlzeuQ", "contributor": "0x7f94dec1e4822ed495baC7236249BE901ae350ff"}

But he is bribing her with a trip to Disney World, and “she’s all in.”\n\nThe family likes to travel, “we really just want to get back in the swing of seeing the world,” Shady said.\n\nAs for youngsters under 5, Pfizer and Moderna are studying their vaccines in children down to 6 months old, with results expected later in the year.\n\nThe Biden administration noted that the expansion of shots to children under 12 will not look like the start of the country’s vaccine rollout 10 months ago, when limited doses and inadequate capacity meant a painstaking wait for many Americans.\n\nThe country now has ample supplies of the Pfizer shot to vaccinate the children who will soon be eligible, officials said, and they have been working for months to ensure widespread availability of shots. About 15 million doses will be shipped to providers across the U.S. in the first week after approval, the White House said.\n\nMore than 25,000 pediatricians and primary care providers have already signed on to dispense the vaccine to elementary school children, the White House said, in addition to the tens of thousands of drugstores that are already administering shots to adults.\n\nHundreds of school- and community-based clinics will also be funded and supported by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help speed the process.\n\nIn addition to doctors’ offices, schools are likely be popular spots for the shots.\n\nIn Maryland, state officials have offered to help schools set up vaccination clinics. Denver’s public schools plan to hold mass vaccination events for young children, along with smaller clinics offering shots during the school day and in the evenings. Chicago’s public health department is working closely with schools, which have already been hosting vaccination events for students age 12 and older and their families.\n\nThe White House is also preparing a stepped-up campaign to educate parents and children about the safety of the shots and the ease of getting them. As has been the case for adult vaccinations, the administration believes trusted messengers — educators, doctors and community leaders — will be vital to encouraging vaccinations.\n\nDr. Lisa Reed, medical director for family medicine at MAHEC, a western North Carolina safety net provider that serves patients from rural Appalachia and more urban communities such as the tourist town of Asheville, said it is going to take effort to get some families on board.\n\nReed said she lives “in a community that has a lot of vaccine hesitancy, unfortunately.”\n\n“Some have lower health literacy or belong to ethnic groups that are more hesitant in general” because of a history of mistrust, she said. And Asheville, she said, has a sizeable population of well-educated adults who are longtime vaccine skeptics.\n\nWhile children run a lower risk than older people of getting seriously ill from COVID-19, at least 637 people age 18 or under have died from the virus in the U.S., according to the CDC. Six million U.S. children been infected, 1 million of them since early September amid the spread of the more contagious delta variant, the American Academy of Pediatrics says.\n\nHealth officials believe that expanding the vaccine drive will not only curb the alarming number of infections in children but also reduce the spread of the virus to vulnerable adults. It could also help schools stay open and youngsters get back on track academically, and contribute to the nation’s broader recovery from the pandemic.\n\n“COVID has also disrupted our kids’ lives. It’s made school harder, it’s disrupted their ability to see friends and family, it’s made youth sports more challenging,” U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told NBC. “Getting our kids vaccinated, we have the prospect of protecting them, but also getting all of those activities back that are so important to our children.”\n\nMurthy said the administration, which is imposing vaccine mandates for millions of adults, is leaving it up to state and local officials to decide whether to require schoolchildren to get vaccinated. But he said such measures would be “a reasonable thing to consider.”\n\n“It’s also consistent with what we’ve done for other childhood vaccines, like measles, mumps, polio,” he said.\n\nThe U.S. has purchased 65 million doses of the Pfizer pediatric shot, which is expected to be one-third the dose given to adults and adolescents, according to officials. They will be shipped in smaller packages of about 100 doses each, so that more providers can deliver them, and they won’t require the super-cold storage that the adult version did at first.\n\nAbout 219 million Americans age 12 and up, or 66% of the total population, have received a COVID-19 shot, and nearly 190 million are fully vaccinated.", "timestamp": 1635062802, "digest": "W94OVOAuyqmL9Si2ZlAV631ibpRzmVAWWccE8Rmy304", "contributor": "0xC46e66793e975C115c6fEb679fB2557ce22FD597"}

Vaughan’s beloved *[Y: The Last Man ](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/y-last-man/)*to the screen. And now that the show is finally airing — after a major recasting, a showrunner change and even a move to a new platform — FX on Hulu abruptly [canceled](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/y-the-last-man-canceled-1235032789/) the drama Sunday, after airing only seven of its planned 10 episodes.\n\nFX, the basic cable network overseen by CEO John Landgraf, rarely cancels its scripted content and instead tends to announce final seasons for its originals. It’s also incredibly rare for the network, which became part of the Disney fold a few years ago, to lower the ax on shows that are still running as its creator-friendly execs opt instead to wait to gather data for things like delayed viewing and digital returns. But that oddly wasn’t what transpired with *Y: The Last Man,* which won’t wrap its freshman season until Nov. 1.\n\n### Related Stories\n\n[TV](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/c/tv/)\n\n### 'Y: The Last Man' Canceled at FX on Hulu\n\n[TV](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/c/tv/)\n\n### 'TV's Top 5': Inside the Long Path to 'Y: The Last Man'\n\nSo, what happened?\n\nSources tell *The Hollywood Reporter* that execs at FX had to make a decision on the future of the series by Oct. 15, which was the date that options on the cast of *Y:TLM* expired. FX, which [landed rights](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/y-last-man-tv-series-831981/) to the IP in 2015, picked the drama up to [pilot](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/y-last-man-moving-forward-at-fx-pilot-order-1100179/) in April 2018 and, three months later, [cast](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/y-last-man-fx-cast-unveiled-as-diane-lane-barry-keoghan-star-1126329/) Barry Keoghan and Diane Lane in leading roles.

Croal and Green [cited](https://twitter.com/mashaka74/status/1117923978088083456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1117923978088083456%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Ftv%2Ftv-news%2Ffxs-y-last-man-loses-original-showrunners-1202211%2F) creative differences as the reason for their departure at the time. Green’s pitch, Vaughan [raved to ](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/brian-k-vaughan-y-last-man-hulus-runaways-saga-1059577)*[THR](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/brian-k-vaughan-y-last-man-hulus-runaways-saga-1059577)* in late 2017, explored toxic masculinity. Eliza Clark (*Animal Kingdom, The Killing*) [was tapped](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/fxs-y-last-man-sets-new-showrunner-1219397/) as showrunner in June 2019 as FX hoped to get the series back on track.\n\nMore Videos\n\n**Next Up**‘SNL’ Breakout Star Bowen Yang Brings the House Down as “Proud Gay Oompa Loompa” | THR News\n\n*‘To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before’ Spinoff Heading to Netflix | THR News*\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 28 secondsVolume 0%\n\n \n\nInstead, further delays followed. Word came in February 2020 that *Dunkirk* breakout Keoghan — who was poised to star as last man on earth Yorick — was being [recast](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/y-last-man-star-barry-keoghan-being-recast-fx-drama-1276990/). Ben Schnetzer (*Warcraft, Pride*) was tapped to [lead the cast](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/y-last-man-fx-drama-finds-new-leading-man-1281360/) by the end of that same month. Days later, the COVID-19 pandemic would create another, albeit unplanned, delay during which *Y* was [moved](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/y-last-man-american-horror-stories-moving-fx-hulu-1299587/) from a linear launch on FX to its hub on Disney-owned Hulu as streaming took center stage across the industry.\n\nProduction on *Y —* including on the new pilot — would not formally [begin](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/fxs-y-the-last-man-finally-begins-production-4084129/) until late October 2020, years after Lane and co-stars Amber Tamblyn and Marin Ireland originally signed on. Other original stars from Green and Croal’s pilot, including Lashana Lynch and Imogen Poots, were recast, with the series enlisting Ashley Romans, Olivia Thirlby and [Elliot Fletcher](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/elliot-fletcher-y-last-man-trans-character-1298603/).\n\nBecause of the delays amid the showrunner and cast changes, FX had to extend options on original *Y* stars, including Lane. And, because of the pandemic-related production shutdown, also pay to extend the options of Schnetzer and other new castmembers. Those cast extensions added up despite the fact that production came in under its $8.5 million-per-episode budget. Clark pitched a potential second season to FX execs in late September, after four of its 10 episodes had aired and well after [reviews](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-reviews/y-the-last-man-1235007783/) for the series were published. (*Y* currently has a 73 percent rating among critics and 67 percent score with viewers on Rotten Tomatoes.)\n\nUltimately, FX brass declined to pay $3 million to further extend options, not wanting to leave the cast in limbo yet again. The cancellation decision was, per sources, not based on viewership figures; Hulu, like other streamers, does not release traditional ratings data. That means FX had little to no data on which to evaluate the series, including how it performed in its entirety over a certain timeframe, etc. While sources note there had been a drop-off among viewers, it’s worth pointing out that mid-series declines are not uncommon now that viewer behavior has shifted to binge-watching entire seasons of a show.\n\n“Without COVID, the show would have been on a different clock,” notes one source of the timing of the cancellation decision.\n\nNow the question becomes if producers, including Clark and Nina Jacobson (*Impeachment*) — both of whom are based at FX Productions with overall deals — can successfully find a new home for their series about gender identity. FX Productions owns the series outright and, per sources, is supportive of plans to shop the show, though the studio has never focused on being a content supplier for outside networks/platforms.\n\nSources say HBO Max is likely the target home for a potential second season as its corporate parent, WarnerMedia, also owns DC Comics, whose imprint, Vertigo, published the *Y:TLM* comic series from 2002-08. WarnerMedia’s New Line previously owned the rights to Vaughan’s comic series and made two attempts at adapting it as a feature film. The first take, from David Goyer, Carl Ellsworth and director D.J. Caruso fell apart because the studio balked at the idea of adapting *Y* as a three-film franchise. The rights to *Y* reverted to Vaughan in 2014, thus killing the 2012 attempt at a movie.\n\nVaughan conceded in a September [interview](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/tvs-top-5-y-the-last-man-brian-k-vaughan-showrunner-interview-1235010820/) with *TV’s Top 5* that his source material turned out to be “challenging subject matter” and stressed the property could only work on television.\n\nShould a suitor for the series emerge, FX Productions would face the decision of selling library rights to season one as well as transferring ownership of the series or becoming a third-party content supplier — something that under Disney is considered a long shot given Disney’s push for vertical integration. (FX declined comment on the cancellation as well as for this story.)\n\nClark, meanwhile, has high hopes for the show and told *TV’s Top 5* that she envisioned *Y* as a five-season, 50-episode series. “I have never in my life been more committed to a story, and there is so much more left to tell,” Clark [wrote](https://twitter.com/TheElizaClark/status/1449800214357762051) Sunday. “*Y: The Last Man* is about gender, about how oppressive systems inform identity. We had a gender diverse team of brilliant artists, led by women at almost every corner of our production. Producers, writers, directors, cinematographers, production design, costume design, stunt coordination, and more. It is the most collaborative, creatively fulfilling, and beautiful thing I have ever been a part of. We don’t want it to end.”", "timestamp": 1635062738, "digest": "Bye5dBbsnJa4Pwpe29Hc2JyF4xquNU9I7FZ8TcBbkBQ", "contributor": "0x8B1db0285B47631728fE87abD9436dBcBa754Aa7"}

The implant was then paired with a video camera mounted in the center of a pair of glasses.\n\nAfter a training period, Gómez was able to decipher visual information that was fed from the camera directly to her brain.\n\nThe training included a video game that helped Gómez learn how to interpret the signals coming from the electrodes. In the game, a screen suddenly shows an image of Maggie Simpson holding a gun, in either her left or right hand. The player must correctly select which hand holds the weapon; using input from the array, Gómez learned how to succeed in that task.\n\nAt the time of the study, Gómez was 57 years old. Because of her participation, including her ability to give clinically precise feedback to the scientists, Gómez was named as a co-author of the study.\n\nSome of the prosthesis' effects were limited; it did not let Gómez identify all letters of the alphabet, for instance. But she \"reliably discriminated some letters such as 'I,' 'L,' 'C,' 'V' and 'O,' \" according to the study.\n\n### Further studies could use more electrodes to boost visual data\n\nThe microelectrode array was implanted through a \"minicraniotomy,\" in a process that the researchers say \"is straightforward and follows the standard neurosurgical procedures.\" It involves making a hole in the skull measuring 1.5-cm (a bit larger than half an inch).\n\nThe array is just 4 mm (about an eighth of an inch) square, but it holds 96 electrodes. The researchers say previous studies have found around 700 electrodes could give a blind person enough visual information to boost their mobility to a useful extent. And because the implant required only small electrical currents to stimulate the visual cortex, they're hoping to add more microarrays in the future experiments.\n\n\"One goal of this research is to give a blind person more mobility,\" said Richard Normann, a researcher at the John A. Moran Eye Center at the University of Utah. \"It could allow them to identify a person, doorways, or cars easily. It could increase independence and safety. That's what we're working toward.\"\n\nA [clinical trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02983370?term=NCT02983370&draw=2&rank=1) related to the study is scheduled to continue through May of 2024. The research is being funded through several entities, including Spain's Ministry of Science and Innovation and Miguel Hernández University, as well as the Moran Eye Center.\n\nThe method of bypassing the eyes altogether could someday restore vision to roughly 148 million people worldwide — that's how many people have had the link between their eyes and their brain severed, the researchers say, due to conditions such as glaucoma or optic nerve atrophy.\n\nThe approach used by the researchers from Utah and Spain is similar to one that was hailed last year, when scientists said they were able to [get volunteers to see letters](https://www.livescience.com/drawing-letters-on-the-brain.html) by sending electricity through electrodes on the brain's surface.\n\nVisual impairment is one of the most common disabilities in the world and scientists are employing several strategies to help people who are affected by it.

This includes some of the *first stars ever born*, the most distant galaxies, and curious planets in the cosmos.\n\n\"It's really cool,\" marveled Chen, an astronomer at the [Space Telescope Science Institute](https://www.stsci.edu/), an organization that will run the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST.\n\nThe instrument's deeply-anticipated launch is currently set for Dec. 18, 2021, though in recent months the telescope has often been in the news for reasons unrelated to its scientific endeavors. [NASA named the remarkable instrument after James Webb](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/content/about/faqs/whoIsJamesWebb.html), NASA's leader in the 1960s who oversaw the agency during a time when the federal government [persecuted and fired LGBTQ employees](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nasa-needs-to-rename-the-james-webb-space-telescope/) from NASA and other departments. It was a shameful time in American history called the \"[Lavender Scare](https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2016/summer/lavender.html).\" For now, NASA said it [will keep the JWST label](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/10/13/nasa-james-webb-telescope-name-controversy/) after finding no evidence about Webb that \"warrants changing the name.\"\n\nJWST, originally dubbed the \"Next Generation Space Telescope\" in the 1990s, will join the legendary Hubble Space Telescope in capturing clear views of the universe from space. Hubble is a scientific treasure. Over the three decades it's orbited 340 miles above Earth, Hubble has provided [unprecedented, brilliant views of the cosmos, galaxies](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2021/hubble-images-a-galaxy-in-dazzling-detail), and [planets](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/hubble-captures-crisp-new-portrait-of-jupiters-storms). Yet JWST is not a replacement for the aging Hubble. JWST is a successor, with different, and advanced, abilities.\n\nHere's what JWST, and ultimately *you*, will see that Hubble can't.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope on left, and the Hubble Space Telescope on right. Credit: NASA / GSFC\n\n## Seeing into the deep, deep past\n\nTelescopes with bigger mirrors can see fainter objects. That's because larger mirrors capture more light. Imagine particles of light as ping pong balls, and a telescope's mirrors as a bucket. Hubble's mirror is around eight feet in diameter, while JWST's mirror is much larger, at over 21 feet in diameter.\n\n\"You're going to collect more ping pong balls,\" explained Jean Creighton, an astronomer and the director of the Manfred Olson Planetarium at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee.\n\nCapturing more light is critical for observing the earliest stars and galaxies that formed in the universe, over 13 billion years ago. The [universe is incessantly expanding](https://www.loc.gov/everyday-mysteries/item/what-does-it-mean-when-they-say-the-universe-is-expanding/), meaning it's constantly grown or stretched since its violent inception (the [\"Big Bang\"](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/big-bang/en/)), so the light from these ancient parts of the cosmos is very, very, very far away (billions of [light-years](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/faq/26/what-is-a-light-year/)). The most far-off light left stars billions of years ago, so observing this light is like peering into the deep, deep past.\n\n\"We're looking back in time,\" said Chen. (Even when we look at our own star — [with protection](https://www.nasa.gov/content/eye-safety-during-a-total-solar-eclipse) — we're also peering into the past; it [takes over eight minutes](https://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/venus/q89.html) for sunlight to reach Earth.)\n\n\"We're looking back in time.\"\n\nAnd we'll see unprecedented things.\n\n\"We're going to see the very first stars and galaxies that ever formed,\" said Creighton. \"We have not been able to do this with Hubble.\"\n\nThe size comparison between JWST's mirror and Hubble's mirror. Credit: NASA\n\nHubble can see faint light that's about 1 billion years old. If all goes as planned, JWST will see light that's nearly 13.7 billion years old, when the earliest stars and planets started to form.\n\n## Lifting the veil\n\nHubble largely views light that humans can see (aka [\"visible light\"](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight)). But there are many types of light that our eyes *can't see*. JWST is specialized to observe one of these, called \"[infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves),\" which allows astronomers to see vastly more stars and planets.\n\nHow so?\n\nThe universe is filled with thick, smoke-like clouds of dust and gas. \"That obscures things,\" explained Jason Steffen, an assistant professor of physics at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who researches planets outside our solar system (aka exoplanets).\n\n\"It lifts the veil.\"\n\nBut infrared light can slip through thick clouds of dust. Infrared has longer [wavelengths](https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/atmosphere/wavelength) than visible light, so the light waves don't get scattered as much (and obscured) by particles in the universe. Longer wavelengths, whose peaks and valleys are spread far apart, are less likely to collide with particles in space.\n\nThe image comparison below, taken by Hubble, shows how infrared light slips through cosmic dust. That's the Carina Nebula, a dazzling cloud of dust and gas. Hubble's infrared view reveals the many stars hidden behind the dust.\n\n\"It lifts the veil,\" said Creighton.\n\nThe Carina Nebula viewed in visible light (left) and infrared (right).

Credit: NASA\n\nWhat's more, viewing extremely distant galaxies and stars is made much easier (or at times possible) by seeing them in infrared light. As described earlier, [the universe is constantly expanding](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/mystery-of-the-universe-s-expansion-rate-widens-with-new-hubble-data), and the light traveling through the cosmos stretches, too. \"If you're looking at a distant galaxy, that light has been stretched out,\" explained Steffen. The light's wavelengths become longer.\n\nThat's a problem. \"This can make distant objects very dim (or invisible) at visible wavelengths of light, because that light reaches us as infrared light,\" [writes NASA](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/content/about/comparisonWebbVsHubble.html). But JWST's infrared views make the invisible visible.\n\n## Super-Earths\n\nThere are few things in the universe more enthralling than exoplanets. Why, some of these known planets, like \"[super-Earths](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/what-is-an-exoplanet/planet-types/super-earth/)\" some two to 10 times the size of our planet, might contain habitable, rocky environments, or even water. JWST will spend a significant amount of time viewing exoplanets in other star systems. (To JWST, these planets will appear as dots, not grandiose, colorful planets.)\n\nAlready, NASA has confirmed [finding over 4,500 exoplanets in the universe](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/). But with JWST's ability to peer through clouds of dust, the astronomer Chen expects to find considerably more.\n\nA graphic showing Earth contrasted with a conception of the \"super-Earth\" 55 Cancri e. Credit: NASA / JPL-Caltech / R. Hurt (SSC)\n\nCrucially, JWST won't simply sleuth out the existence of exoplanets. It will analyze their atmospheres. The telescope [carries an instrument called a spectrometer](https://jwst.nasa.gov/content/observatory/instruments/nirspec.html) that can reveal what particles are composed of, based on how light reacts with them. (Light passing through water vapor or oxygen, for example, behaves in certain, well-known ways.)\n\nEven a [relatively unexciting spectrograph image](https://www.nasa.gov/content/hubble-space-telescope-space-telescope-imaging-spectrograph) can be considerably more useful to astronomers than a brilliant picture. \"There's a whole lot of information,\" explained Creighton.\"It gives much more information than the pretty picture does.\"\n\nOf particular interest to scientists are [the rocky, seven known planets orbiting the star TRAPPIST-1](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1481/new-clues-to-compositions-of-trappist-1-planets/), some 40 light-years (235 trillion miles) from Earth. Perhaps JWST will discover a rocky planet that has hints of potential life in its atmosphere, like the oxygen algae and plants breathe into our air.\n\n\n---\n\nBefore any of this cosmic science begins, however, JWST has a great, if not daunting, journey ahead.\n\nSEE ALSO: [If a scary asteroid will actually strike Earth, here's how you'll know](https://mashable.com/article/asteroid-earth-impact-warning-nasa)\n\nAfter a nail-biting launch (the robotic cargo is unusually precious), JWST must make the 1 million-mile journey through space. Its tightly packed hexagonal mirrors must unfold properly, and its [tennis-court-sized sunshield](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/nasa-s-webb-telescope-packs-its-sunshield-for-a-million-mile-trip) must unfurl as planned. And unlike with Hubble, astronauts can't launch into space and fix any potential problems with the extremely distant telescope.\n\nThe launch looms large in the astronomical world. \"Everyone's crossing their fingers,\" said Steffen.", "timestamp": 1635062961, "digest": "SsYudwN3eQExJMjO0H8LURb8qVycJ1rDQ285RrFmg9o", "contributor": "0x597dC0Cb1F614AcabBee2715Af3A4c77AA88B2Ba"}

Scientists believe marine crabs moved on land and into freshwater between 75 and 50 million years ago, but that leaves behind a significant time gap.\n\n\"So we’ve had this gap between the predicted molecular time of split of non-marine crabs and the known fossil record of about 50 million years,” Luque said.\n\nUsing micro CT scans of the fossil, scientists constructed a 3D representation of what the ancient crab may have looked like. In addition to being the most complete crab fossil found to date, it is also the oldest non-marine crab ever described.\n\nThis will allow researchers to compare the ancient crab with other species to understand how they evolved.\n\nLuque says it isn't an ancestor to modern crabs but rather, \"a distant cousin.\"\n\nUniversity of Alberta - tiny crab\n\n*The two-millimetre-long fossil of the ancient crab was found encased in a piece of amber jewelry at a market in Tengchong, China.

The dino is an ancestor of long-necked herbivores called sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus.\n\nMost of the chicken-sized eggs were discovered in clusters of eight to 30, suggesting they resided in nests as part of a common breeding ground. Scientists also found Mussaurus skeletons of similar sizes and ages buried together. Combined, these patterns offer evidence that the dinosaurs lived in herds.\n\n\"I went to this site aiming to find at least one nice dinosaur skeleton. We ended up with 80 skeletons and more than 100 eggs (some with embryos preserved inside!)\" Diego Pol, a researcher with the Egidio Feruglio paleontology museum in Patagonia and the lead author of the new study, told Insider via email. \n\nHe called the site \"one of a kind.\"\n\nBefore this discovery, researchers thought herding behavior was restricted to dinosaurs that came much later, in the very late Jurassic and early Cretaceous periods. That's because the earliest fossil evidence of sauropod herds only dates back 150 million years. This nesting ground, however, pushes that timeline back more than 40 million years. It's the earliest known evidence of social groups among dinosaurs, the study authors said.\n\n## X-rays offer a peek into fossilized dinosaur eggs\n\nA fossilized Mussaurus egg that's more than 190 million years old, found in southern Patagonia, Argentina.\n\nRoger Smith\n\nArgentine paleontologists discovered the first Mussaurus skeletons at this Patagonian site in the late 1970s. The dinosaurs they found were no more than 6 inches long. Unaware that they'd uncovered newborns, the researchers named the creature \"mouse lizard\" because of the skeletons' tiny size.\n\nPol decided to reexplore the area starting in 2002, and by 2013, he'd helped find the first adult Mussaurus fossils there. Those bones revealed that full-grown versions of these \"mouse lizards\" were closer in size to modern-day hippos. They grew to weigh about 1.5 tons, reaching lengths of 26 feet from nose to tail tip. But infants could fit in the palm of a human hand.\n\nA screen shot from a video showing how scientists like Diego Pol used high-energy X-rays to peek inside a Mussaurus egg without destroying it.\n\nVincent Fernandez/Diego Pol/European Synchrotron\n\nSince then, Pol's team has also uncovered and studied the contents of the nesting ground, which measures just under half a square mile. In 2017, he took 30 of the eggs to a lab in France, and his group then used X-ray technology to peek inside and confirm the species of the embryos without breaking the shells.\n\nBy analyzing the sizes and types of bones in the nesting ground, the researchers determined that the animals were buried near counterparts of a similar age. Some clusters had juveniles less than a year old, others consisted of individuals that were slightly older but not yet fully grown, and finally, there were smatterings of adults that had died solo or in pairs.\n\nThat type of age segregation, the researchers said, is a key sign of herds: Juveniles hung out with others their age while adults looked for food and protected the community. \n\n\"They were resting together and likely died during a drought,\" Pol said. \"This is compatible with a herd that stays together during many years and within which the animals get close to each other to rest, or to forage, or do other daily activities.\"\n\nAnother strong indication of herd behavior is a nesting ground itself: If Mussaurus lived as a community, it would make sense that they'd lay eggs in a common area. \n\n## Living in herds may have helped Mussaurus survive\n\nNest with Mussaurus eggs dated to more than 190 million years ago, found in Patagonia.\n\nDiego Pol\n\nTo figure out the fossils' ages, researchers examined minerals in volcanic ash that was scattered around the eggs and skeletons, and determined that the fossils were about 193 million years old. \n\nPreviously, scientists thought this type of dinosaur lived during the late Triassic period, about 221 million to 205 million years ago. But the new date suggests instead that Mussaurus thrived during the early Jurassic period. That, in turn, is evidence that Mussaurus' ancestors survived a mass extinction event 200 million years ago.\n\nThe key to that survival, the study suggests, may have been their herding behavior.\n\n\"These were social animals and we think this may be an important factor to explain their success,\" Pol said. \n\nAn artist's depiction of the nesting ground of a Mussaurus herd of in what is now Argentina.\n\nJorge Gonzalez\n\nCommunal living likely helped Mussaurus find enough food, perhaps by making it easier for them to forage over larger areas.\n\nMussaurus of the same size would likely \"group together to coordinate their activities,\" Pol said, given that larger adults and tinier juveniles moved at different speeds.\n\nHe added that given the size difference between newborns and adults, it probably took these dinosaurs many years to reach full size.

Does the practice of ‘minting’ - publishing on the blockchain - reintroduce a sense of ‘the original’ or does NFTs just reinforce the destruction of aura and the commodification of art? \n\nIn order to develop these ideas and questions, we’ll have to situate the essay into Benjamin’s broader work and even into the philosophical tradition including Aristotle and Plato.

There is always a lense, we always use conceptual structures to interpret the world. Clarification often also leads to inspiration, or so I hope, also regarding “the metaverse'“ and “NFTs”.**\n\nIn this first post of a series, I’ll do some brief studies of philosophers who can offer insights about the metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In later posts the list can be expanded or modified. “Metaverse” to me means interconnected shared digital spaces, accessible by various devices and encompassing the physical reality. This is broader than virtual, augmented or extended reality, it includes 2D virtual worlds and gaming environments. An NFT is a unique and non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a blockchain, referring to digital objects such as pictures, videos and game items. The property rights of an NFT can vary.\n\nIn the course of the series I’ll use extensively Wikipedia, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, other encyclopedias and the original texts.\n\nThinking about digital art and digital objects, there’s this essay by [Walter Benjamin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin) (1892-1940), [The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction) (1935). He discusses practices which at that time were relatively young such as photography and cinema. In the essay he explains that mechanical reproduction devalues the *aura* (uniqueness) of a work of art. There is the idea of the value of the original work and how that gets devalued by the emergence of reproductions and by being separated from tradition and ritual.\n\nWhat does this say about digital objects which can be effortlessly and perfectly reproduced? Does the practice of ‘minting’ - publishing on the blockchain - reintroduce a sense of ‘the original’ or does NFTs just reinforce the destruction of aura and the commodification of art?\n\nIn order to develop these ideas and questions, we’ll have to situate the essay into Benjamin’s broader work and even into the philosophical tradition including Aristotle and Plato.", "timestamp": 1635069604, "digest": "pghLX1-5TUYJHdFfzLITQ2FIMuAvhOyaKQDiZw7PlZw", "contributor": "0xD1f5a5B13B5903eE22e5aB2f0AfC00f9Cd7CB65e"}

{"id": "YMv5z3OarVfxz0DK_8nr7sFrEDiv0fDkv8zLJZGghbY", "title": "Why US Policymakers Should Embrace Web 3", "body": "* Governments should recognize the unique qualities of the internet.\n* The private sector should lead.\n* Governments should avoid undue restrictions on electronic commerce.\n* Where governmental involvement is needed, its aim should be to support and enforce a predictable, minimalist, consistent and simple legal environment for commerce.\n* Electronic commerce on the internet should be facilitated on a global basis.\n\nIn the ensuing decades, the internet transformed our economic and social interactions in ways that have profoundly changed society – for better and worse. Today, we stand at a similar moment for the next generation of the internet, and it’s time for a new set of principles that incorporate lessons learned over the past 25 years.\n\n***Tomicah Tillemann is global head of policy for crypto and James Rathmell under him at a16z. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s [“Policy Week,”](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/18/crypto-2022-policy-week/)*** a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa).\n\nPolicymakers are finally taking a long overdue interest in Web 3. But the conversation is overwhelmingly about what policymakers don’t want from technology: fraud, illicit use, unsustainable energy consumption, systemic risk. We believe it’s time to establish an affirmative vision of what we do want from technology. Open societies need a North Star to guide our efforts and innovation.\n\nWeb 3 is the most credible alternative for reshaping and redeeming institutions that have fallen short over the last few decades. The list includes Big Tech, Wall Street banks and broken public assistance platforms that have failed to quickly and efficiently deliver needed help to Americans in times of crisis.\n\nBig tech has been embroiled in an unending series of controversies over the past decade, ranging from poor stewardship of consumer data and privacy breaches to disinformation and algorithmic bias. But these platforms are now being disrupted and disintermediated by Web 3. For instance, decentralization has opened up the possibility of a world in which people can own their data and grant applications permission to use it on a limited basis, rather than having that data littered across hundreds of centralized databases.\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) is another area that holds great potential. If fintech platforms like mobile payments revolutionized the frontend of finance, we can think of DeFi as revolutionizing the backend – laying new pipes and rails that are easier and more efficient to access, audit and upgrade.\n\nThis new generation of digital infrastructure could help realize goals that have long eluded policymakers, such as expanding access to consumer finance products, reducing the cost of capital, enabling capital formation for small businesses worldwide and improving compliance through easy, instantaneous auditability. Policymakers will still need to develop thoughtful regulatory frameworks in this space that protect consumers from bad actors and ensure the stability and integrity of our financial system. However, if we are judicious in how we incubate these tools, we can usher in a new renaissance of economic opportunity.\n\nWeb 3 also holds tremendous promise for government itself. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led the federal government to make a major investment in Americans who were struggling to make ends meet. The proposals now being considered in Congress would bring even more aid to working families across the country. Yet, our antiquated financial systems leave far too many people waiting weeks or months for help to arrive in moments of desperation, and then even longer for checks to clear.\n\nAt the same time, existing systems have proven shockingly vulnerable to exploitation by foreign organized crime rings, which stole tens of billions of dollars from taxpayers by exploiting weaknesses in our increasingly decrepit financial architecture. Tools like stablecoins and digital identity – if embraced by Washington – can enable more efficient distribution of aid to working families and protect our systems from exploitation by foreign criminals.\n\nDecentralization is more than a buzzword. It puts power and control back in the hands of consumers and individuals. Web 3 systems can be more inclusive, more equitable and more resilient. Simply put, they’re a dramatically better alternative to a broken digital status quo.\n\nTechnological innovation is often necessary to unlock social change and economic growth, but it is certainly not sufficient. Without a well-conceived public policy framework that recognizes the wide diversity of the Web 3 ecosystem, we may never realize the benefits of decentralized digital transformation.\n\nFailure to get this right would mean two things:\n\nFirst, other countries – potentially countries with values contrary to our own – would set the standards that define the next generation of global technology.\n\nSecond, we will miss what may be our only opportunity to apply the lessons learned from the failures of Big Tech, Wall Street and broken institutions, to implement a new vision for the role we want our technology and our institutions to play in people’s lives.\n\nThe growth of Web 3 has been driven by entrepreneurs who grew up in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and want to improve on the systems of the past. And consumers are actively participating as well: we already see [almost one in six Americans under the age of 35 years old investing in crypto](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/cnbc-invest-in-you-august-2021/), with strong engagement especially among [Black and Hispanic Americans](https://www.rollcall.com/2021/09/07/left-behind-by-financial-system-minorities-turn-to-new-products/). These technologies are addressing a deep demand for solutions in communities that have not always been well-served by traditional finance.\n\nSince its founding, the United States has been home to innovation, imagination and independent thinking.

Morris is CoinDesk's Chief Insights Columnist. He holds Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and small amounts of other crypto assets.\n\nEarlier this week, we [considered](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/19/defi-is-like-nothing-regulators-have-seen-before-how-should-they-tackle-it/) the challenges of creating viable long-term regulations for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. These systems can ostensibly remove intermediaries from the trading of any asset represented on a blockchain, but those intermediaries have been the ones enforcing rules on behalf of regulators for the better part of a century. That means workable DeFi regulation will likely be much different in substance, and enforced differently, than current securities and finance rules.\n\nThat rethink may be years away from occurring, but U.S. regulators aren’t sitting idly in the meantime. With Securities and Exchange Commission chief Gary Gensler signaling that he’s paying attention, there’s significant expectation that enforcement actions could target DeFi well before any new regulations become official. Those enforcement actions will likely prioritize instances of clear lawbreaking, such as fraud or money laundering, taking place on DeFi systems.\n\n***This op-ed is part of [“Policy Week,”](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/18/crypto-2022-policy-week/)*** a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa). David Z. Morris is CoinDesk’s chief insights columnist.\n\nThey will be significant tests for the legal implications of decentralization. And they could get very, very ugly – particularly for individuals running “DeFi” systems that aren’t very decentralized at all.\n\nHere, based on conversations with lawyers, former regulators and DeFi executives, are three key points about how things are likely to play out over coming months and years.\n\n**1. Enforcement will come before new rules.**\n\nThe first ugly truth about DeFi regulation is that it will inevitably come too late. Systems like UniSwap and Celsius were built in ways that challenge the fundamental premises of conventional financial regulation, but regulators will not be quick to shift their models to conform with the reality on the ground. Meanwhile, DeFi systems continue to grow, guaranteeing they’ll face increasing scrutiny.\n\nJai Massari, a partner focused on trading and markets at the law firm Davis, Polk and Wardwell, predicts a three-step process of reconciling those conflicting truths. Call it the Stages of Regulatory Grieving.\n\n“I think it starts off with enforcement,” she says, “because enforcement is easier than regulation.” Those enforcements could be similar to recent actions that have led to large fines for crypto exchanges like [Kraken](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/cftc-fines-crypto-exchange-kraken-125-million-margined-products-illegally-2021-9) or services like [Tether](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21). But they could also go further to include criminal charges against individuals, on which more below.\n\nThen we’ll begin to “see an effort \\[by regulators\\] to push these DeFi activities into existing regulatory categories,” Massari says. “But I don’t think that’s going to go well. I think it could be quite messy.”\n\nIn other words, she doesn’t expect serious consideration of a new regulatory framework that actually fits how DeFi works until after regulators spend time trying to hammer square pegs into round holes. In the U.S. context that could include jurisdictional fights between the SEC and other financial regulators.\n\nPlenty of crypto operators will rightly view putting enforcement ahead of regulation as shutting the barn door after the horse is loose. To some extent, it’s a consequence of the shifting priorities of a new administration. Trump administration regulators, for better or for worse, made only incremental progress on laying out rules for crypto, much less DeFi, as crypto and DeFi grew from marginal to meaningful between 2016 and 2020.\n\nThere are signs regulators see things as running out of control. “It appears \\[Gary Gensler is\\] aligned with people like \\[Massachusetts Sen.\\] Elizabeth Warren that it’s the wild west, that it’s under-regulated,” says Katherine Kirkpatrick, co-chair of the Financial Services working group at the law firm King & Spalding.\n\nGary Gensler and Co., in other words, see themselves as trying to lasso a galloping stallion. That may lead to particularly strong enforcement tactics.\n\n“They’re operating from the perspective of trying to solve something that’s the most egregious thing going on using traditional law enforcement tools,” Duane Pozza, a former Federal Trade Commission staffer who is now a partner at Wiley Law. “Because it means there will be fewer limits.”\n\n**2. Investigators will “Pierce the Veil” of decentralization.**\n\nIn principle, DeFi protocols run without owners, leaders or managers. Much like Bitcoin, the protocols are in principle just software run by a collection of node operators or validators who neutrally facilitate transactions while collecting liquidity yield and fees.\n\nGovernance decisions, including changes to the protocol itself, could also in principle be managed by users. But there are still few examples of this in practice today; instead, the reality of “DeFi” in the present is often that it’s a fig leaf for a very clear group of core leaders who are actually in charge. The [clearest evidence](https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/the-breakdown-with-nlw/how-decentralized-is-defi/) of this is instances where accounts, tokens or entire “decentralized” systems have been frozen or shut down.\n\n“One of the design decisions in an autonomous system is whether there’s a kill switch,” says Stephen Palley, a lawyer focused largely on crypto regulation at Anderson Kill. “The problem with a kill switch is, what’s the liability or exposure of the person who controls it? To be truly autonomous, you can’t have a kill switch. The absence of that is a way to say you’re not responsible.”\n\nIt’s a grim irony of DeFi’s coming collision with legal reality: DeFi administrators who have been taking direct action to control problematic activity may have given law enforcement clear evidence that they’re actually the ones in charge, making themselves targets.\n\nParticularly in cases where there is no legal entity affiliated with a DeFi platform, experts say this could lead to regulators and investigators “piercing the veil” in their DeFi enforcement actions. “Piercing the veil” is a legal term of art normally applied to prosecutions of corporate wrongdoing that target individual officers of the company, not just the legal corporation itself.\n\nAt least two recent crypto prosecutions have shown the willingness of the SEC and others to pierce the veil of crypto organizations, even those that have conventional corporate structures. One was the [SEC’s charging](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338) of individuals at Ripple, including CEO Brad Garlinghouse, with an unregistered securities offering. The other was [the filing](https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/the-breakdown-with-nlw/how-decentralized-is-defi/) of money laundering-related criminal charges against officers of BitMEX, including CEO Arthur Hayes.\n\nSimilar direct action against individuals with control over DeFi systems may not be far off. SEC chief Gensler has already made clear that he views most claims of decentralization in DeFi [with skepticism](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/19/gary-gensler-isnt-buying-your-decentralization-theater/). In addition to use of kill switches, law enforcement may look for evidence of control and responsibility in public representations of a protocol’s team, or control of [multisig wallet](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/10/multisignature-wallets-can-keep-your-coins-safer-if-you-use-them-right/) keys.\n\n**3. Clarity will not come soon.**\n\nIt will be extremely tricky to craft regulation that controls risks like fraud and money laundering through DeFi while preserving technological advantages like open access, self-custody and democratic governance. That could be worth the trade-off in the long term if new rules are truly crafted carefully.\n\n“We’re at a moment where a bit of enlightened thinking about regulation, a little creativity, a little open-mindedness would result in a much better outcome,” says Jai Massari. “I think the best approach is to take a step back and think about the policy objectives we’re looking for.”\n\nThat process could easily take years. In the meantime, enforcement actions will likely ramp up, perhaps leaving DeFi creators and administrators in the difficult position of defending themselves for breaking rules that simply can’t be fairly applied to the new technology.\n\nEven then, there’s no guarantee that competent and well-considered regulation will be the end result. As we saw over the summer with the poorly crafted reporting requirements in the U.S. infrastructure bill, there is still a large technical deficit in technical knowledge among legislators and regulators, and it can have serious consequences.\n\n“The technological shortfall is pretty significant,” says Duane Pozza. “The lawmakers have a million other things going on. We’re far away from getting to the point of understanding DeFi. I do think the infrastructure bill was a wakeup call – at least some influential people on \\[Capitol\\] Hill had to learn, had to think through this new technology.”\n\nThat leaves an uncomfortable status quo, at least for those in the world’s largest financial market. For a period that could stretch for years, there will be no changes to U.S. financial regulations to accommodate the way DeFi really works. But at the same time, law enforcement and regulators will likely be making life very uncomfortable for anyone who could be seen as having authority or control over DeFi systems.\n\nUnless something changes very soon, that will almost certainly push innovation in DeFi out of the United States, much as huge, centralized crypto exchanges including Binance and BitMEX found it more comfortable to center their operations elsewhere. It’s a message that at least some would-be creators are getting directly from their legal advisers.\n\n“I might not agree with the application of certain laws to what my clients do, but I’m not the \\[Commodity Futures Trading Commission\\], I’m not the SEC,” says Palley. “I’m just a simple country lawyer and I have to call balls and strikes.\n\n“So I spend a lot of time just telling people to stay out of the United States. I hate it, but it’s good advice.”", "timestamp": 1635071915, "digest": "Qu9C9ZAEVaKh5dWz4R4ozb7D85kk-0QYB9_2rZ1hy0I", "contributor": "0x2F251E4e7c95abc45A874ACE11D86c8c49C99c3E"}

Today, we stand at a similar moment for the next generation of the internet, and it’s time for a new set of principles that incorporate lessons learned over the past 25 years.\n\n***Tomicah Tillemann is global head of policy for crypto and James Rathmell under him at a16z. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s [“Policy Week,”](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/18/crypto-2022-policy-week/)*** a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa).\n\nPolicymakers are finally taking a long overdue interest in Web 3. But the conversation is overwhelmingly about what policymakers don’t want from technology: fraud, illicit use, unsustainable energy consumption, systemic risk. We believe it’s time to establish an affirmative vision of what we do want from technology. Open societies need a North Star to guide our efforts and innovation.\n\nWeb 3 is the most credible alternative for reshaping and redeeming institutions that have fallen short over the last few decades. The list includes Big Tech, Wall Street banks and broken public assistance platforms that have failed to quickly and efficiently deliver needed help to Americans in times of crisis.\n\nBig tech has been embroiled in an unending series of controversies over the past decade, ranging from poor stewardship of consumer data and privacy breaches to disinformation and algorithmic bias. But these platforms are now being disrupted and disintermediated by Web 3. For instance, decentralization has opened up the possibility of a world in which people can own their data and grant applications permission to use it on a limited basis, rather than having that data littered across hundreds of centralized databases.\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) is another area that holds great potential. If fintech platforms like mobile payments revolutionized the frontend of finance, we can think of DeFi as revolutionizing the backend – laying new pipes and rails that are easier and more efficient to access, audit and upgrade.\n\nThis new generation of digital infrastructure could help realize goals that have long eluded policymakers, such as expanding access to consumer finance products, reducing the cost of capital, enabling capital formation for small businesses worldwide and improving compliance through easy, instantaneous auditability. Policymakers will still need to develop thoughtful regulatory frameworks in this space that protect consumers from bad actors and ensure the stability and integrity of our financial system. However, if we are judicious in how we incubate these tools, we can usher in a new renaissance of economic opportunity.\n\nWeb 3 also holds tremendous promise for government itself. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led the federal government to make a major investment in Americans who were struggling to make ends meet. The proposals now being considered in Congress would bring even more aid to working families across the country. Yet, our antiquated financial systems leave far too many people waiting weeks or months for help to arrive in moments of desperation, and then even longer for checks to clear.\n\nAt the same time, existing systems have proven shockingly vulnerable to exploitation by foreign organized crime rings, which stole tens of billions of dollars from taxpayers by exploiting weaknesses in our increasingly decrepit financial architecture. Tools like stablecoins and digital identity – if embraced by Washington – can enable more efficient distribution of aid to working families and protect our systems from exploitation by foreign criminals.\n\nDecentralization is more than a buzzword. It puts power and control back in the hands of consumers and individuals. Web 3 systems can be more inclusive, more equitable and more resilient. Simply put, they’re a dramatically better alternative to a broken digital status quo.\n\nTechnological innovation is often necessary to unlock social change and economic growth, but it is certainly not sufficient. Without a well-conceived public policy framework that recognizes the wide diversity of the Web 3 ecosystem, we may never realize the benefits of decentralized digital transformation.\n\nFailure to get this right would mean two things:\n\nFirst, other countries – potentially countries with values contrary to our own – would set the standards that define the next generation of global technology.\n\nSecond, we will miss what may be our only opportunity to apply the lessons learned from the failures of Big Tech, Wall Street and broken institutions, to implement a new vision for the role we want our technology and our institutions to play in people’s lives.\n\nThe growth of Web 3 has been driven by entrepreneurs who grew up in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and want to improve on the systems of the past. And consumers are actively participating as well: we already see [almost one in six Americans under the age of 35 years old investing in crypto](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/cnbc-invest-in-you-august-2021/), with strong engagement especially among [Black and Hispanic Americans](https://www.rollcall.com/2021/09/07/left-behind-by-financial-system-minorities-turn-to-new-products/). These technologies are addressing a deep demand for solutions in communities that have not always been well-served by traditional finance.\n\nSince its founding, the United States has been home to innovation, imagination and independent thinking. The success of the country has been anchored in philosophy and practice of decentralization – a belief that many independent actors could create a whole that was more than the sum of its parts, and deliver outcomes that were better than what could be achieved by concentrating power in the hands of the few.

Morris is CoinDesk's Chief Insights Columnist. He holds Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and small amounts of other crypto assets.\n\nWe’re nearing the end of “Policy Week” here at CoinDesk, which I’ve spent focused on the particularly thorny issues of regulating decentralized finance (DeFi). The technology, which removes intermediaries like banks and exchanges from asset trading, may require a [major rethink of how securities regulation works](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/19/defi-is-like-nothing-regulators-have-seen-before-how-should-they-tackle-it/). In the short term, though, there [will likely be serious crackdowns](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/21/lassoing-a-stallion-how-gensler-could-approach-defi-enforcement/) that test the reality of that decentralization.\n\nThere has been a recurring theme in the reactions to these pieces: that “DeFi” subjected to any sort of limits or controls whatsoever isn’t really “DeFi.” On one level, that’s true enough: As crypto-lawyer extraordinaire Stephen Palley laid out when discussing [enforcement](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/21/lassoing-a-stallion-how-gensler-could-approach-defi-enforcement/), the sort of kill switches or other controls necessary for regulation to work are usually controlled by a small group of insiders. It’s an open question whether entirely open and anonymous DeFi systems will be able to survive once enforcement really gets rolling.\n\n***This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s [Policy Week](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/18/crypto-2022-policy-week/)***, a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa). It published first in The Node newsletter. You can subscribe to get the full ***[newsletter here](https://www.coindesk.com/newsletters)***.\n\nBut on another level, knee-jerk declarations that only anonymous systems qualify as “DeFi” are narrow-minded. There are unique features to the technology, such as self-custody and shared liquidity pools, that don’t depend on anonymity and that could offer real benefits to the way we run mainstream asset markets.\n\nIt seems entirely fair to debate whether “DeFi” is still the right term for permissioned trading protocols, but we should also be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. That’s particularly true because DeFi could lead to innovations in know-your-customer (KYC) practices that would significantly increase privacy and security for individuals even in a regulated environment. This morning, we published [a conversation](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/22/gensler-for-a-day-regulating-defi-with-fireblocks-ceo-michael-shaulov/) with Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov that delves into this “soft KYC.”\n\nPersonally, I think the best-case scenario long term is that a large portion of DeFi gets regulated, and slowly eats away at more traditional trading technologies. Meanwhile, a smaller group of protocols that are truly and carefully decentralized will continue operating outside of regulation. The stakes are quite different, but you might compare it to the way online media piracy has evolved: Law enforcement has applied enough pressure to make it really hard to continue running a torrent site (prayers up for [What.CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What.CD)), but you can still find all the free Game of Thrones you could ask for if you’re willing to do some research and take some risks.\n\nThe specific benefits of keeping stateless DeFi alive include giving dissidents and others access to tools that circumvent governments and corporations. That option only becomes more important as government and corporate oversight of our finances and internet activity becomes more terrifyingly normalized. Just as bitcoin will serve as a useful check on misguided national monetary policies, cultivating autonomous zones outside of state control will be a check on the most authoritarian impulses of lawmakers and regulators.\n\nAnd just as the stateless utility of bitcoin is improved by the continued health of regulated centralized exchanges and other fiat onramps, regulated DeFi might be a net positive for its free-range counterpart. Both that potential and the concrete utilitarian benefits of even regulated DeFi make it worth thinking seriously about regulation, instead of just dismissing it out of hand.", "timestamp": 1635071786, "digest": "QGvsJ6U0qtwwkzVgZavIMLtWwxMAOKRZHeDtSnvL4ls", "contributor": "0xe3FF118cACfC37b79563D846cDe9d8C4D33E302d"}

Did the asset go up or down? How consistent was that movement? How significant was the rise or fall?\n\nCombining all of these data points, it creates the VORTECS™ Score, a dynamic and constantly evolving evaluation of the current trading conditions for each supported asset. The higher the score, the more bullish the outlook — and the more confident the algorithm is. Conversely, a very low score is bearish (and equally confident). A neutral score of 50 means the algorithm sees no significant correlation between current conditions and past price performance.\n\nThe [Markets Pro](https://pro.cointelegraph.com/?via=analysis) team started testing a whole range of strategies on the day the algo went live.\n\nA Buy 80, Sell 12 hours strategy means that the test ‘buys’ every asset that crosses the 80 score, which is considered strongly bullish. And then it ‘sells’ the asset again after precisely 12 hours.\n\nOf course, this is not happening on an exchange — it’s happening on a spreadsheet. And since the test wants to maintain equal holdings of all assets that are within its range, it rebalances every hour.\n\nFor instance — if SOL crossed 80, and was the sole asset with that high score, the test would place 100% of its current portfolio into SOL. But if BNB then crossed 80 as well, the test would allocate half of its position to BNB in the next hourly rebalance.\n\n**Why you couldn’t do this**\n\nFirst, let’s assume that you’re human if you’re reading this. If you’re human, you need sleep. The test is working 24 hours a day, every day, and has been for over ten months. Even new parents get a break from the baby once in a while.\n\nSecond, the algo is not taking account of liquidity or order depth on any particular asset on any given exchange. It ‘buys’ at the current price, and ‘sells’ at the current price, which we all know isn’t necessarily realistic.\n\nAnd third, exchange fees for a rebalance every hour would be prohibitive, no matter how much BNB or FTT you’re hoarding.\n\n**So why is this a valuable test at all?**\n\nThe point here is to evaluate whether the VORTECS™ algorithm is good at its job.\n\nWhen it sees bullish conditions, is it \\*right\\* more often than not? When the score goes up, do prices generally increase? Obviously with this test, the answer is yes.\n\nAnd while the Buy 80, Sell 12 is an outlier, there are other strategies that have created massive hypothetical ROI.\n\nFor instance, Buy 80, Sell 24 hours. That one is sitting on “gains” of 13,099%. Other strong strategies include:\n\n**Buy 90, Sell 168 hours |  +4,544%**\n\n**Buy 80, Sell 80 | + 14,862%**\n\nIn fact, with Bitcoin returning 49.5% since the tests started running on Jan 5th 2021, *every single strategy* has beaten the ROI from simply holding BTC.\n\nAnd that signals that VORTECS™ is working correctly. It is — in general, over time — proving that historical trading conditions for digital assets can be a useful gauge for the current health of that asset.\n\n\\*\\*In other words, a high VORTECS™ Score has a proven correlation to price appreciation. \\*\\*Not in every instance, not for every asset… but in general this ten-month trial has made a compelling case.\n\nWarren Buffett (perhaps paraphrasing Hegel) once said that “What we learn from history, is that people don’t learn from history.”\n\n(As a crypto skeptic, he might want to revisit his stance.)\n\nThat’s what the VORTECS™ Score is all about. Learning from history. And that’s why a hypothetical return of 36,205% is important.\n\nIt tells us we’re looking at the right history.\n\nCointelegraph Markets Pro is [available exclusively to members](https://pro.cointelegraph.com/?via=analysis) on a monthly basis at $99 per month, or annually with two free months included.

{"id": "HwRgka6irpsCOSm5rAm-USaNB0iwSDZs4KE7XfMyXXU", "title": "海外社交巨头的加密梦，光鲜之下实有焦虑", "body": "长久以来，海外社交巨头们对于加密领域惊人的执着。\n\n海外社交媒体巨头 Facebook 最新动向显示，其已在部分地区推出其 Novi 数字钱包的小型试点，旨在推出其规划已久的、一种以稳定币作为支付工具的新用例。\n\nFacebook 对此尝试已久，去年 6 月，Facebook 发布了名为「Libra」的数字通证，计划向数十亿的潜在用户提供数字交易和支付服务，并推出为此推出名为 Calibra 的数字钱包。但囿于监管压力，2019 年一系列场面激烈的国会听证会之后，该项目几乎停滞。\n\n今年 5 月，Facebook 将数字钱包「Calibra」更名为「Novi」，以进行品牌重塑和平台隔离，通过强调项目的独立性，来适应当地的合规需求，让该项目继续发展下去。\n\n本月，Facebook 宣布 「all in」元宇宙后，Novi 的发展再次受到关注，数字钱包或将成为元宇宙的入口。Facebook 称：「通过 Novi 数字钱包，用户可以即时、安全且免费地发送和接收资金」。\n\n比较客观的分析认为，通过在大型社交平台的网络系统置入数字钱包，或将能够带来关联于社交平台的稳定币产品的大规模采用，这可能会为市场带来新的用户需求、商业模式乃至金融现象。\n\n海外社交巨头们区块链之路，向来备受关注。\n\n海外社交巨头们的加密梦\n在数字通证方向，Facebook、Twitter 等海外社交巨头动作频频。\n\n7 月份，扎克伯格表示「我预计人们将从主要把我们视为一家社交媒体公司，转变为视我们为元宇宙公司」，他还称「在很多方面，元宇宙是社交艺术的终极表达」。10 月，Facebook 宣布将在未来五年内于欧盟内创造 1 万余就业岗位，并计划改名，彰显出转向「元宇宙」的坚定信心。\n\nFacebook 的元宇宙构想中，该宇宙的关键特征在于开放性与互操作性，并让公司平台、开发者、创造者和政策制定者之间和谐合作，推动业务进一步增长。\n\n这种规划并不意外，实际上，Facebook 在这一赛道动作频频。9 月份，Facebook 推出了 5000 万美元基金用于帮助构建元宇宙；10 月份，Facebook 又推出新的 1000 万美元创作者基金，激励人们在其 VR 平台 Horizon Worlds 上进行体验，并让更多人参与到内容创作与贡献中。\n\n该项基金的使用规划能够展示出 Facebook 的元宇宙框架的一部分：基金将在未来一年内被用于社区竞赛、支持创作者、为开发人员提供资金三个方向，来协助其与 Epic Games 及 Roblox 等游戏巨头展开竞争。\n\n在被普遍认可的元宇宙基本要素定义中，一个完备的元宇宙包括去中心化、体验层、发现层、空间计算、分布式、创作者经济、人机互动、基础设施等部分。Facebook 作为传统互联网社交巨头，本身已经拥有了元宇宙的优良基因。此外，在 VR（虚拟现实）与 AR （增强现实）早有投资布局，已经满足了体验、互动、设施等多个部分。\n\n而在主流的元宇宙平台构建体系中，要让以上几部分统一成为生态体系，区块链技术是不可缺少的。具有强金融属性的区块链技术几乎能够覆盖以上所有要素，在构建经济系统上不可或缺。因此，Novi 的数字钱包，或许就是 Facebook 元宇宙中最为重要的拼图之一。\n\n在官方介绍中，Novi 的主要作用是为用户提供普惠式金融服务，能够便捷地添加、发送、接收或提取资金方面，且没有隐藏收费。在 Novi 钱包内，Facebook 同样设计了类似稳定币机制，不过，由于其推出的 Diem 暂未获得监管机构支持，在测试中，使用了稳定币 Paxos Dollar 来使用，这与加密钱包的设置类似。\n\nFacebook 拥有超过 30 亿的用户，其元宇宙的构想足以让整个市场密切关注。\n\n此外，社交巨头同样注意到了 NFT 对于社交领域可能带来的机会。8 月份，Facebook 曾表示，正在考虑构建与 NFT 相关的产品和功能，Novi 钱包可以用于存放 NFT ，让元宇宙的基础设施有所完善。\n\n当然，同一时期，其他海外社交巨头也在跟进。Twitter 可以说是进展速度最快的巨头之一。\n\n前段时间，另一个海外社交巨头 Twitter 刚刚更新了「小费」的进化史。\n\n9 月份，Twitter 推出了基于闪电网络的比特币小费支付功能，该功能目前已对 IOS 用户开放。Twitter 的比特币支付思路有 2 种：第一种，通过包括 Square Cash App 和 Go Fund Me 在内的支付选项菜单，将允许用户向比特币地址发送小费或以传统方式汇款。另一种是通过 Strike，直接使用建立在闪电网络之上的支付应用程序。\n\nTwitter 更为明确的抓准了「大型社交平台」的应用方向。在最新测试版中，Twitter 正将这种支付功能进行延伸，让用户使用比特币来「打赏」内容创作者，增加社区互动。此外，Twitter 还在进行初步的市场教育，比如告诉用户什么是比特币闪电网络（Bitcoin Lightning Network）、什么是托管钱包和非托管钱包，如何将 Strike、Blue Wallet 和 Wallet of Satoshi 作为托管钱包的例子，等等。同时，该平台支持使用 Strike 生成比特币闪电网络发票，以便打赏功能能够更好地进行。\n\nTwitter 的比特币小费同时还强调了社区属性，并对 NFT 的扩张做出快速反映。在打赏钱包推出之后，Twitter 同期还提出了「探索 NFT 进行身份验证」的计划。Twitter 官方曾经公开了「Twitter NFT」的设想。与其他 NFT 产品思路类似，Twitter 允许用户连接比特币钱包，即可在平台上跟踪和展示其 NFT 的所有权。该 NFT 还具有强烈的社交色彩。官方表示，「Twitter NFT」可以以徽章的形式出现，经过验证的用户可以使用。\n\nTwitter 对于 NFT 的偏好更加有迹可循，六月底，Twitter 曾发布了名为「The 140 Collection」的系列 NFT，这 140 件 NFT 在 OpenSea 交易量曾突破 500 万美元，对于传统机构来讲，具有一定的启示。\n\n除此之外，传统互联网巨头也有其他的区块链结合方式。巨头微软近期宣布加入「Decentralized Identifier」（DID）赛道 。微软的思路在于，采用基于区块链的技术，比如比特币、以太坊的技术，将分布式 ID 验证应用于微软身份验证应用程序（DID）。与传统身份识别不同的是，分布式身份识别将不受中心化机构所控制。有分析认为，依托于互联网原有资源优势，DID 协议或将成为 DID 赛道的有力竞争对手。\n\n美国跨国娱乐巨头 AMC 对区块链热情高涨，该公司甚至希望直接发行自己体系内的通证。AMC 首席执行官 Adam Aron 近期就表示，AMC 正在探索成功发行通证的可行方法。\n\n这家企业长期以来便看好数字资产，早在两个月前，该公司就有计划在今年年底前接受比特币支付电影票，并完善相关基础设施。随后，该公司在加密支付上还陆续计划加入 ETH、LTC、 BCH、DOGE 等，而使用这些通证，或将还能给予用户一定的优惠。\n\n有趣的是，AMC 正是今年早些时候 MEME 行情的参与者之一。今年年初，美国社交媒体 Reddit 股票论坛 WallStreetBets 出现了「美国散户对战机构空头」事件，AMC 即为受到散户投资者关注的股票标的之一，并被加上了特殊的 Meme 属性。\n\n一些难题、进展、与总结\n海外社交巨头们的不懈追逐之下，「传统社交巨头 + 区块链」发展已有起色。但由于涉及用户面过广，这些巨头们同样面临着一些难题。\n\n尽管 Facebook 试图与 Diem 保持独立，但是美国参议员仍在呼吁 Facebook 停止推出 Diem 和 Novi，并尝试组织 Diem 被推向市场。主要原因在于，参议员们仍然对 Facebook 的数据管理存疑，认为其在保护用户数据或管理支付网络难以被信任，且该平台稳定币的推出可能会给金融稳定带来风险。而这种封面态度是继 Libra 之后长久存在的，或许在短期仍难以解决这些问题。\n\n再以 AMC 为例，这家娱乐巨头同样或将面临着长期的合规难题。在美国，上市公司发行通证并非一件容易的事情。近期，美监管层对于通证发行的审查仍在不断增加，这种尝试尚前途未明。\n\n另一方面，一些第三方机构看到了社交巨头们的流向，正在尝试补足这种需求。很多区块链产品更为完善的第三方服务机构正在推出类似的产品，满足在传统互联网社交平台上满足加密用户的相关需求。\n\n这些具有创意的用例正在增多：10 月中旬，元宇宙游戏 CryptoVoxels 是一个构建在以太坊上的虚拟世界，其官方最近计划在推特、Facebook 等开通入口，使得用户可直接进入。近期，一第三方插件也提出了 NFT 头像功能，在用户连接钱包后，用户同样可以在 Twitter 个人设置界面中，直接将钱包所持的 NFT 设置为头像，并获得相关的链上持有认证。\n\n无论如何，传统的互联网巨头们用户量巨大，一旦与加密世界有所联通，对于金融服务和数字资产都将影响巨大，这一领域值得长期关注。", "timestamp": 1635072280, "digest": "Dr8Czbql6xWWpEeBBYhIKQfG-nFR0ODjpTqGLkDEpHE", "contributor": "0xa1e8C5986de6D30E8d0c9FFee3A59b101897E6AE"}

{"id": "xPJoZ-8q38MMx4U8wqB6VwIKsWE9V3qwmVkIVlbj7tU", "title": "「DeFi2.0」来袭，是真升级还是玩概念？", "body": "最近一个月，各主流DeFi协议处于增长的停滞状态时，「DeFi2.0」一词突然在加密圈传开。加上了「2.0」，是真升级还是玩概念？\n\n「DeFi2.0」的首次提及大概可以追溯到借贷协议Alchemix的开发者。其开发者Scoopy Trooples在一次线上直播中认为，基于第一代协议搭建的DeFi应用，由于再次进行了从0到1创新，因此可以被视作第二代协议，称为「DeFi2.0」。\n\n然而，由于DeFi玩家及开发者圈子对这样的分类并不买账，特别是DeFi本身就存在「乐高组」的开放性，因此，对哪类协议能被归到「DeFi2.0」中还存在广泛争议，这就让这个「2.0」的概念就变得无从精准定义。\n\n理解「DeFi2.0」之前，或许需要先理清「DeFi1.0」是什么。\n\n我们知道，那些早期的去中心化金融基础设施构成了目前的DeFi场景，比如，去中心化交易应用DEX （Uniswap、SushiSwap等）、借贷应用（Compound、Aave、MakerDAO等）、稳定币应用（Curve）、流动性机枪池应用（Yearn等）等等。\n\n这些应用当前已经形成了基本的产品功能和各自的经济系统，经过了至少两轮的市场考验，吸引了大量的用户前去使用，构成了当下DeFi市场的主流应用方向。由于它们也在不断更新换代，甚至协议之间还相互产生连接，比如，借助DEX的流动性池而产生的杠杆耕作协议，所以如果说他们是「DeFi 1.0」还不太准确，更像是「1.5」时代。\n\n按照Scoopy Trooples的理解，如果在这些早期创建的、如今相对成熟的DeFi应用上再做创新，衍生出了其他的新产品或新机制，那么这些协议就可以被归类进「DeFi2.0」。\n\n那么，创新的产品功能、新的经济模型大概是DeFi2.0的重要特征了。\n\n当前市场上，一些协议正在被归类进DeFi 2.0中，比如基于目前已经存在的主流DeFi协议构建的新功能组建，案例是基于Curve搭建的低滑点跨链协议Convex，还有在原基础DeFi协议上采用创新激励机制的浮动算法协议OlympusDAO。\n\n如果从用户视角看，2.0体现出的升级性还需要有DeFi玩家体验改善的特性，比如，改进Token经济模型的，改革DeFi流动性收益耕作方式的，提升资金利用率的，能平滑转移风险的，具备更合理的社区治理形态和结构的……\n\n按照互联网及其产品更迭的特征看，当用户的需求和体验能在迭代中得到大幅的提升，「2.0」才更名副其实，比如网民们从互联网到移动互联网的迁徙，比如手机按键以触摸式取代键盘式。\n\n在DeFi还未成为主流金融产品的补充或替代品之前，它仍处在早期发展中，即便知名的DEX、借贷应用、稳定币、资管应用已经吸引了大量的用户和资金与DeFi应用交互，但这些应用仍然处于相对成熟的状态，还无法达到主流金融场景的丝滑与安全。\n\n或许我们没有必要纠结DeFi的升级编号，对于用户来说，最重要的是DeFi协议市场又出现了哪些新的功能，这些功能能否改变以前的体验，能否让持有的加密资产价值更大化。\n\n当然，在DeFi市场追求新体验，往往也伴随着风险痛苦，玩家有时候一个不小心就成了「创新者」实验的炮灰，这样的现象正在发生。\n\n「DeFi2.0」概念给用户注射想象力时，OHM（OlympusDAO）、CVX（Convex）等所谓的「2.0」代表性Token的涨幅又给用户扎了一针「兴奋剂」，惊艳之后是惊吓。不久前，OlympusDAO合约代码问题的传言导致OHM从最高1400美元暴跌至500美元。\n\n此外，由于不少「DeFi2.0」应用是匿名项目，创建成员的技术能力、应用代码的安全性都存在疑问，不管是1.0还是2.0，这些是DeFi市场当下的普遍风险，尝试的前提是做到足够的了解。从当前各个2.0概念的应用运作机制看，这些应用说白了有点「借鸡生蛋」的意思，DeFi「乐高组合」特性潜在的安全隐患、高波动市场下的清算风险等等都是用户不可忽视的「雷区」。\n\n本期DeFi蜂窝将介绍最近被提及最多、关注度最高的「DeFi2.0」应用，在提示风险的前提下一窥这些应用到底做了哪些DeFi的功能性变革。\n\n## 跨链生息资产借贷应用Abracadabra\n\n### 简介\n\nAbracadabra money（SPELL）最初是建立在以太坊上的跨链生息资产借贷协议，目前已多链部署，在BSC、Arbitum、Avalanche、Fantom等多条公链上运转。\n\n所谓「生息资产」，可以简单理解为能带来收入的资产，通常由原生资产锁仓而获得，你可以把它理解为原生资产因锁仓而获得的存款凭证或收据，也有人将它称为「生息债券」的Token化——Interest bearing tokens。\n\n这些生息资产常常来源于SushiSwap、Yearn、Curve等主流DeFi协议原生资产的锁仓，属于锁仓原生资产带来的生息收益，比如：\n\n* xSUSHI——它就是用户在SushiSwap平台上锁仓SUSHI而来，持有xSUSHI的用户可以获得SushiSwap交易费用的定期分红；\n* veCRV——它是用户在Curve协议上锁仓CRV所获得的生息资产，持有veCRV的用户可以获得Curve的交易费用分成，还可以投票决议Curve上LP资金池的挖矿收益率；\n* yvVault资产——它是yvYFI、yvUSDC、yvUSDT、yvWETH等生息资产的统称，分别来自于机枪池应用Yearn V2中YFI、USDC、USDT、WETH等资金池的锁仓代币，持有yvVault可以获得Yearn V2上对应资金池的收益。\n\n在Abracadabra money应用上线以前，xSUSHI, veCRV, yvVault等这类生息资产持有用户，只能定期获得相应锁仓协议的收入分红或投票治理权益。但由于不支持市面流通或交易，用户的很多生息资产只能躺在钱包里，无法被高效利用。\n\nAbracadabra协议为「释放这些放生息资产流动性」而来，它帮助生息资产持有用户更好地管理收益，目标是生息资产的利用率。\n\nAbracadabramoney官网\n\n### 运作机制\n\n用户可以把生息资产存入Abracadabra应用中，然后用生息资产作抵押，铸造稳定币MIM（Magic Internet Money）。MIM与USDT、DAI 、USDC这类稳定币一样，允许在市场上流通和交易。\n\n举个简单的例子来说，Jack有价值5000 USDT的生息资产xSUSHI，他现在急需将1000 USDT套现用于现实生活中的周转,但他又不想破坏他在SushiSwap上的生息收益。这时，他就可以把xSUSHI抵押到Abracadabra应用上，铸造出1000 MIM，然后再将这1000 MIM去稳定币兑换协议Curve上换成1000 USDT。等他资金周转开后，可以把1000 MIM债务赎回，取回原数量的xSUSHI。假如他不归还，Abracadabra应用会从他的账户中扣除等值的xSUSHI。\n\n允许用户抵押生息资产来借出稳定币MIM，Abracadabra就是以此方式释放抵押物的流动性的。\n\n此外，Abracadabra也发行了应用通证SPELL，该通证的最大发行总量为2100亿个，主要功能是用户可将SPELL质押在Abracadabra 中以获得sSPELL。持有sSPELL的用户可以投票决定哪个生息资产可以上线Abracadabra，还可以投票去决策Abracadabra的借贷利率、清算规则等。当然，和很多生息资产一样，持有sSPELL也可以获得Abracadabra应用的收入分红。\n\n目前，用户可以在Abracadabra参与流动性收益耕作，通过存入xSUSHI、 veCRV、yvVault、FTM等资产获得SPELL奖励。\n\n## 数据\n\n根据Defillama数据显示，Abracadabra的加密资产锁仓价值（TVL）为31.9亿美元。SPELL暂报0.019美元，流通市值13.46亿美元。\n\n## 去中心化杠杆应用Fodl Finance\n\n### 简介\n\nFodl Finance（FODL）由DeFi巨鲸「0xb1」地址背后的团队搭建，它属于去中心化杠杆应用，允许用户在不支付资金费率的情况下使用杠杆交易，主要注意的是，该应用属于匿名团队。\n\nFodl团队称，他们在链上进行DeFi资产交易时发现，链上资产的波动大，用户需要对WBTC、WETH等资产的波动进行风险管理。为保障资金妥善，用户往往需要通过对冲的方式，转移或管理风险。但是，当市场波动较大时，用户需要对冲风险的资金量也在增加，这时，用户就要为获得杠杆的流动性支付高额的费率。\n\n Fodl Finance官网\n\n在提供杠杆交易的中心化金融市场中，投资者想要持有多头或空头头寸，通常的方式需要从交易平台上借入或借出相应资产，并支付资金费率给对手盘。在杠杆交易高峰期，支付给对手盘的资金费率也高。无论是CEX还是DEX，当最需要利用杠杆交易为自己的投资组合配置对冲策略时，支付的资金费用也最贵。比如，今年4月份加密资产市场的牛市阶段，如果用户持有BTC和ETH等资产的杠杆多头，你持仓获得利润中就有约30%被资金费率所吞噬。\n\n因此，Fodl Finance 开始探索，能否在不依赖中心化交易对手的情况下，用户以低成本获得多头或空头头寸的杠杆。\n\n在链上使用杠杆，通常的操作需要在Compound 、Aave等DeFi借贷应用中进行。用户需要先存入WETH、WBTC、USDC等加密「硬通货」，然后借出DAI。借出的DAI往往会被用户反复存入、借出，以循环利用的方式在各种DeFi应用中捕获收益。这就决定了用户需要根据自己存入的资金量，计算出所能承受的资金风险，以决定杠杆用多大。这也加大了用户操作难度，需要用户对DeFi借贷应用有深刻的理解，并成熟掌握链上清算风险等相关知识。\n\nFodl Finance开始用协议的方式，打包解决这些痛点。\n\n### 运作机制\n\nFodl Finance平台借用了Compound、Aave等借贷应用上资产流动性，一来保障自身应用能拥有充足的流动资金，二来可以支撑用户直接在Fodl Finance上、用存入这些借贷平台资产的方式加杠杆。\n\nFodl Finance认为，从抵押贷款市场获得流动性，不但可以使交易者能够在不支付融资利率的情况下利用杠杆进行交易，还能获取DeFi借贷应用中的通证激励。\n\n从本质上讲，Fodl Finance将传统的 DeFi 借贷平台变成了货币市场，将用户存入借贷应用中的资产当保证金，然后再为用户提供杠杆。\n\n需要注意的是，Fodl Finance并不是传统的杠杆保证金机制。传统的杠杆交易中，你只需付少量的保证金，支付一定的资金费率，就可以使用所需要的杠杆。但在Fodl Finance，你开杠杆的资金来源于你存在Compound、Aave等借贷应用中的资产，你开杠杆的资金数量取决于你存入借贷应用的资金量。使用FodlFinance杠杆意味着，你只是在此平台上简化了循环借出或存入的流程，把你的循环借贷过程给整合了起来。除了简化流程外，Fodl Finance还汇聚了借贷每种资产的收益，用户可以根据收益高低来选择适宜的头寸。\n\n具体操作流程是，用户先要选择要用哪个借贷应用上的存储资产，然后选择加杠杆的资产数量及杠杆倍数，Fodl会自动计算借出资产能匹配的杠杆。当用户开仓时，Fodl会拿出一笔闪电贷款，让用户能在单次交易中开立全部杠杆头寸而无需用户再循环操作。\n\n如果你想持有多头头寸，供应给Fodl的资产是非稳定币，而借出来的资产是稳定币，比如提供ETH，借出DAI；提供COMP，借出USDC；提供ETH，借出USDC……这些头寸适用于那些看多市场、寻求从某种资产/稳定币的价格升值中获利的用户。\n\n如果你想持有空头头寸，供应给Fodl的资产是稳定币，借出的资产是非稳定币。如提供DAI，借出ETH；供应USDC，借出COMP；供应USDC，借出ETH……这些头寸适用于那些对市场看跌、寻求从资产/稳定币的价格贬值中获利的用户。\n\n目前，Fodl Finance测试版已上线，支持用户对AAVE、Compound上的资产进行加杠杆操作，另外，用户也可以在Fodl应用中为FODL-ETH、FODL-ETH等LP池提供流动性来获取FODL奖励。FODL是Fodl Finance应用的生态通证，主要用来FodlDAO 的治理,同时也是未来Fodl Finance应用收入分配的凭据。\n\n### 数据\n\nFodl Finance测试版10月15日上线，10月20日晚开启流动性挖矿，目前应用锁仓金额为8700万美元。FODL发行总量为10亿个，其中2亿FODL在Sushiswap平台上以0.025美元初始价格进行了预售,FODL暂报0.85美元。\n\n## 算法储备币Olympus（OHM）\n\n### 简介\n\nOlympusDAO（OHM）是建立在以太坊上的算法通证项目，由社区推动。OlympusDAO旨在通过特定算法创建一种由一揽子加密资产支持的自由浮动储备货币—OHM，并希望OHM能成为纯粹的加密原生储备资产。\n\nOlympusDAO官网\n\n当前的加密资产市场中，由于BTC和ETH等加密资产波动性比较大，用户需要一个价格相对稳定的资产与其交易，与美元锚定的各种稳定币普及于市场中。用户能接受稳定币，是因为他们相信稳定币在今天和明天都拥有相同的购买力，但一个问题是，作为法定货币，美元由有美国政府背书，由美联储控制，当经济运行失当时，美元贬值也会造成稳定币贬值。\n\n在这样的背景下，OlympusDAO希望能在加密世界创建一种算法货币，无论加密市场如何波动，都能让它保持购买力，如同现实世界的黄金一样，由供需关系决定价格。\n\n### 运作机制\n\nOlympusDAO不同于以往的算法稳定币项目，所铸造的OHM价格没有锚定任何资产，每个OHM都由OlympusDAO「国库」中的一篮子资产支持，例如以太坊上的去中心化稳定币DAI，雪崩协议上的发行的稳定币FRAX等。\n\nOlympusDAO的规则显示，每个OHM由1 DAI支持，而不是与之锚定。这就决定了OlympusDAO「国库」需要储备DAI来支持OHM。当OHM价格低于1 DAI时，OlympusDAO将回购并销毁OHM，以此减少OHM的供应，使其市场价格重回1DAI；当OHM的市场价格大于1 DAI时，OlympusDAO会以折扣价出售OHM，增加OHM的循环供应，以使其价格回落。\n\n你可能以为OHM内在价值就是1DAI，即1美元左右，其二级市场价格也应该在1DAI附近震荡。但OlympusDAO协议的规则写定，OHM的实际价格由市场需求决定，自由浮动，目前，OHM暂报970美元左右。\n\n为何OHM的市场价格会如此偏离铸造时支持的资产值？OlympusDAO团队称，这主要是因为OHM的价值不是与另一种资产（例如美元）挂钩，而是由自由市场决定。就像任何其他非挂钩资产（黄金）一样，它受供求关系的影响。另外，应用所获得的利润会赋能给OHM，而OHM无论是出售还是回购，都在赚取利润，所以OHM的价格更多反应的是OHM持有者为OlympusDAO的潜力支付的溢价。\n\n为何OlympusDAO无论是出售还是回购，OHM总有利润？\n\nOlympusDAO回应，在该应用中，无论是OHM交易价格大于1DAI还是小于1DAI, 协议都会获得利润，因为当OHM>1DAI时，OlympusDAO可以收到多于1 DAI的销售费用，当OHM<1DAI，它可以用少于1DAI的费用购买OHM。更重要的是，OlympusDAO将这些利润的90%按比例分配给OHM参与者，10%分配给DAO。\n\n举个例子来说，目前OHM报价为981 DAI,你在Sushiswap买1OHM时，协议收到981个DAI，用它来铸造981 OHM。1 OHM归你所有，因为这是你购买OHM的当前价格。在剩下的980个OHM中，882个OHM（90%）进入了质押合同，剩下的98个OHM（10%）被保存在DAO中。质押合同中的OHM慢慢地被重新分配给OHM质押者，流通的OHM供应量随着时间的推移而增加。\n\n这就意味着，如果你持有OHM,未来出售OHM的所有利润里的90%会流向OHM的持有者。这就吸引着用户想成为OHM的持有者。但事实上，这会导致OHM的价格非常不稳定，尤其是OHM的交易估值比其价格底线1DAI要高得多。\n\n为了平衡OHM的价格，OlympusDAO又创造了OHM债券销售发行机制，即发行LP债券和DAI债券。债券存续期（亦可视为投资人收回其债券投资的资金所需时间的一个指标）是5天以上，当债券的折现率超过5天的质押回报率时，用户就会受到激励而购买债券。从债券中获得的资产被存入国库，OHM也根据出售债券资产量被铸造，增大OHM供应量。\n\nOlympusDAO独创了LP债券机制，用户可以在SushiSwap上组成的OHM-DAI、OHM-FRAX等LP资产，用LP低价购买债券，这个债券可以拿来以折扣价获得OHM，也可以额外获得OHM奖励。\n\n如此一来，OlympusDAO就可以控制DEX上的OHM流动池，该协议本身成了自己的做市商，无论市场情况如何，它都能够承诺提供流动性，并最终降低其通证价格的波动。同时还为其原生通证引入新的需求渠道。\n\nOlympus DAO 的启动方式是近期项目中比较独特的。团队没有通过空投或流动性耕作的方式分发通证，而是面向其Discord成员发售，它以20万美元的估值向成员出售73%的创世OHM，每个购买者最终可获得141OHM，单价在4美元。这本质上是一个内部的等量众筹。\n\n需要注意的是，OHM不单是Olympus DAO生态中的算法通证，也是治理代币。OHM可以被质押以换取sOHM、sOHM，允许OHM持有者累积协议利润以及参与OlympusDAO治理。但稳定币不稳定的风险也成为它最大的「雷区」，需要参与者警惕。\n\n### 数据\n\n根据OlympusDAO官网显示，截至10月20日，该应用的加密资产锁仓资价值（TVL）为26.5亿美元，OHM暂报991美元。", "timestamp":

Spoiler alert: It is almost\\* always better to lend a Uni v3 option \\*🤯\n\nTo establish a Uniswap v3 LP position, one has to lock an asset (eg. ETH) and an numéraire (eg. DAI) between a user-specified range defined by a lower tick tL and an upper tick tH. The value of such a Uniswap v3 LP position is\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*e8jOyKsO1kmjibBdeXQYLw.png)\n\nwhere S is the price of the asset in terms of the numéraire, K is the strike price √(tL\\*tH), and r is the range factor √(tH/tL). The range factor determines how “sharp” the transition between holding the asset and the numéraire is.\n\nI described in details in [several](https://lambert-guillaume.medium.com/uniswap-v3-lp-tokens-as-perpetual-put-and-call-options-5b66219db827?source=friends_link&sk=43c071fa2796639a60fce6c9abd5aa76) [other](https://lambert-guillaume.medium.com/synthetic-options-and-short-calls-in-uniswap-v3-a3aea5e4e273?source=friends_link&sk=9fa4cdb12aab88ca9ecdc4d767a4ee1e) [posts](https://lambert-guillaume.medium.com/how-to-create-a-perpetual-options-in-uniswap-v3-3c40007ccf1?source=friends_link&sk=91f05c9be6573a9b67264c79052a4766) how the value of a Uniswap v3 position is analogous to a short put for narrowly defined (ie. single-tick) positions.\n\n\\*\\*What about Long options? \\*\\*If one is able to borrow a Uni v3 LP position and pay it back at a later time, this is equivalent to the purchase of a long put. The user would *pay* a fixed premium when borrowing the LP position.\n\nWhat should that premium be? Can we use an established framework like the Black-Scholes model to price a Uni v3 position directly?\n\n**The answer is Yes.**\n\nIn this post, we will show how we can achieve this by decomposing V(S) into a *short put* component, which corresponds to a single-tick position, and a \\*range component, \\*which only exists between the upper/lower ticks.\n\n## Options pricing from Feynman-Kac\n\nBefore deriving the price of a Uni v3 option, it is worth revisiting how regular options are priced. There are many ways to derive the price of a regular call option using the Black-Scholes model. My favorite way is to use the [Feynman-Kac formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman%E2%80%93Kac_formula), which states value of an option u(S,t) is given by:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*wil1nIT0oqfYAmo59b6r4w.png)\n\nwhere V(x, T) is the payoff function at expiration and the average ⟨ ⋅ ⟩ is taken over the probability measure of a Geometric Brownian Motion.\n\nUnderstanding the meaning of the Feynman-Kac formula is simple: the value of an option at a time T is found by computing the **average value of the payoff function over all possible price movements** between now and a time T in the future.\n\nPhysicist [Richard Feynman](https://i.imgur.com/3fGl0.jpg) initially developed a similar equation in the context of the path integral formalism of quantum mechanics, where the “expected” location of a particle is determined by the weighted sum of all possible paths the particle can take. Mark Kac realized that they were working on a similar problem when he heard a talk by Feynman when they were both at Cornell, and out of that collaboration emerged the Feynman-Kac formula ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman%E2%80%93Kac_formula)).\n\nSo, computing the Feynman-Kac formula directly, we get:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*grctr0cZ40NtoxLZrrOMjw.png)\n\nFor a call option, the payoff V(S,T) = max(S-K,0) and for a put option V(S,T) = max(K-S, 0). Thus, the value of a call and put option at time t is given by:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*KJnSzt7zgZruOQRzASUd-Q.png)\n\nProving that this agrees with the Black-Scholes pricing is left as an exercise to the reader.\n\n## Pricing Uniswap v3 options\n\nThe Feynman-Kac formula makes it easy to compute the value of exotic options. We will apply the Feynman-Kac formula to find the value of a Uniswap v3 option.\n\nTo make things a bit simpler, let us first decompose the value of a Uni v3 LP position into two distinct components V(S, t) = V_p(S, t) + V_ρ(S, t), where V_p=-max(K-S, 0) is the payoff of a short put option, and **range payoff V_ρ** is given by:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*C2U4qQDjachRJ1MTmlBy_g.png)\n\nWe can graphically see how the put and range payoffs are related to the value of a Uni v3 position: the range payoff is maximum at the strike price and reaches zero at the upper/lower ticks (I’m plotting the negative of the range payoff for simplicity).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*l0vfBo4LMECscbLh9zw9yQ.png)\n\nUsing this decomposition, we can explicitly solve for the value of a Uni v3 option at a time t using the Feynman-Kac formula. Doing this, we get:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*DJusyYz4LZAt-2-C651sbQ.png)\n\nwhere Put(S, t) is the familiar price of a short put option at strike K given by Black-Scholes.\n\nThe “range option “ ρ(S,t) component is a strictly positive term that corresponds to the value of the ranged part of an LP position. Solving the Feynman-Kac formula, we obtain a rather complicated expression for ρ(S,t):\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/5200/0\\*spCfvIzUchgdlYfL.png)\n\n*Yep, you read that right. Erf.*\n\nAlthough we’re not interested in the details of ρ(S, t) for now, we can graphically see that ρ(S,t) looks like this:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*u5IWQHOSaTpcY43Clb9BcA.gif)\n\n**Can we make this expression simpler?**\n\nThe expression for the value of a Uni v3 position is rather complex. Luckily, we can simplify the analysis significantly.\n\nAs shown in my post about [creating perpetual options in Uniswap v3](https://lambert-guillaume.medium.com/how-to-create-a-perpetual-options-in-uniswap-v3-3c40007ccf1?source=friends_link&sk=91f05c9be6573a9b67264c79052a4766), a good approximation for a Uni v3 LP position with range factor r is a regular put option at time T_r, where\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*tBXjVOhahiGa3NbK.png)\n\nTherefore, we can reduce the expression for the option pricing given by the Feynman-Kac formula to a much simpler expression that’s taking advantage of the range factor/DTE relationship above. Specifically, we get:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*wRctMqPLobwujHij1z4fzA.png)\n\nIn other words, the value of a Uniswap v3 option is equivalent to a short put option that expires at a fixed number of days to expiration (DTE) so that DTE > 0 at expiration.\n\nThe price of a Uni v3 option is still subjected to theta decay before expiration, but [gamma](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/gamma.aspx) would be capped at the gamma of a 45DTE option.\n\nHow accurate is this approximation? We can see in the figure below, which compares the fixed-DTE approximation with the computed value of a Uni v3 option, that the difference between the fixed-DTE put approximation and the exact solution is not significant for range factors less than about 2:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*TXC5PNfSpc9tQxxAnaANzA.gif)\n\n## Are Uni v3 returns matching their “option” value?\n\nRight now, the only option for Uni v3 LPs is to hold their position until they accumulate enough fees to turn in a profit. No protocol allows users to easily do borrow/lend Uni v3 LP positions yet\n\nHowever, if such a protocol were available, then the premium received by the Uni v3 liquidity provider for lending their LP position would be given by the Black-Scholes model with a “fixed-DTE” that depends on the range factor r. In contrast, fees would also accumulate if the position was left alone and simply collected fees.\n\nTherefore, in a world where Uni v3 LP positions are minted/lent/borrowed and traded as options, a key question to ask is whether it would it be better to:\n\n> Hold a LP position for a time T and collect the 0.05-0.3-1% fees\n\nor\n\n> “Lend” the option for a time T and collect a fixed premium fee\n\nLet’s explore that question by analyzing the expected yields for both scenarios.\n\n## 1. Holding a Uni v3 LP position\n\nFirst, we can use the expression derived in my[ previous post](https://lambert-guillaume.medium.com/a-guide-for-choosing-optimal-uniswap-v3-lp-positions-part-2-4a94b0a12886?source=friends_link&sk=97149872139ee5f61c26e51204e9a888) to determine the expected payoff of a Uniswap v3 LP position. Specifically, if liquidity is deployed to a single-tick, the expected LP returns for a unit amount of liquidity ΔL is:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*c50t3xluqghXH-2AkmN-9g.png)\n\nwhere γ is the fee tier (ie. 0.01, 0.003, or 0.0005) and the “Tick Liquidity” is the amount of liquidity in the pool at the current tick. The factor of √(8/π)=1.5957691216… comes from deriving the time spent in-the-money assuming that the price follows a Geometric Brownian Motion.\n\nThe key point here is that the returns are expected to grow according to √T. Therefore, since fees accumulate *linearly* over time for wider positions (read [this article](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qg4flibkmt) for more details), we will only consider single-tick positions.\n\nImportantly, this means that **LP returns will depend on the pool’s total volume and the total liquidity at the deployed tick**.\n\nIn the example below, we consider a position deployed at the 3990 tick in the ETH-DAI-0.3% pool. Since that pool has a total daily volume of $15.71m and the 3990 tick has 70.60ETH = $281,694 of locked value, the relative LP returns should be approximately 1.6% per √days or about 30% per year (assuming a 100% annualized volatility).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*3idqx65rtnJ9AL-0HhPTRg.png)\n\nBy comparison, deploying the same liquidity to a similar pool like the ETH-USDC-0.03% pair, we obtain that LP positions earn a 1.37% return per √days or 26.2% per year. *Some pools generate more yields than others. YMMV.*\n\nSome pools have wild (predicted) returns, mainly due to them having a relatively low per-tick liquidity compared to the volumes traded.\n\nFor instance a newly listed token such as RBN only has $500k of locked value at the current tick for $25m of volume. Computing the LP returns for the RBN-ETH 1% pool will be left as an exercise to the reader.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*6vHdEoFX2g5rf-XmukzWiw.png)\n\n## 2. Lending a Uni v3 LP position to an options buyer\n\nOn the other hand, one may wish to mint a Uni v3 LP position and lend it to another user for a time T for a premium.\n\nSpecifically, the premium received will be:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*CBMFfZ9xIc_kGzHH4_BI-A.png)\n\nThis is the familiar expression for the value of a short put, except time has been translated according to t → (t+T_r).\n\nThis expression will depend on the specific underlying, the strike price K, the implied volatility σ, and the time to expiration T. If we consider that the option is minted “at-the-money” where the LP position’s strike price K is equal to the current price, then the value of the put option is simply:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*6ykbspk5EHPfevdCvdvnsg.png)\n\nInterestingly, this expression also depends on the square root of time. This means we can directly compare the premium received per unit of deployed liquidity to the expected returns obtained by holding the LP position and collecting fees.\n\nIf we consider a single-tick position, then T_r will go to zero and (T-t) will be the amount of time the position is held (if it is held until expiration).\n\nTherefore, we simply need to compare the factors multiplying the √T term to find which strategy is the most beneficial:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*2vgR_qhUjcWVrR7fN_b6zQ.png)\n\nAssuming an annual volatility of 100%, this means that holding will only generate returns larger than lending the option if the Daily Volume/Tick Liquidity ratio is larger than:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*vwVyYjrbys1zUu_vXchv3g.png)\n\nThe actual daily volume, tick liquidity, and the [realized volatility](https://lambert-guillaume.medium.com/an-analysis-of-the-expected-value-of-the-impermanent-loss-in-uniswap-bfbfebbefed2?source=friends_link&sk=f9a43cb2f42e27ab0082a7490fd7d8d5) may need to be calculated for each pool in order to accurately determine whether the criteria above (which may change for each pool) is satisfied or not.\n\nAs an example, I’m including below a list of the top 17 pools currently on info.uniswap.org by 24h trading volume and I’ve added a column to show whether the holding ratio is satisfied (4th column, I’ve normalized the ratio to a yearly IV of 100%).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*YeBch-4Y_OxEdn-4zKD1NQ.png)\n\nSome pools do indeed have a large daily volume compared to their locked liquidity. Holding a position in these pools would generate an expected yield that will be higher than the options premium only if the hold ratio is larger than 1.\n\nRight now, only the UNI/ETH, HEX/USDC, and RBN/ETH pools highlighted above would generate higher returns from holding. **Holding any of the pairs with a hold ratio < 1 would underperform lending them as options**.\n\nIn other words, it would be more profitable to lend the Uni v3 LP position for most Uni v3 trading pairs as an ATM option rather than holding+collecting fees.\n\n## *Takeaway (this is in bold because this is important):*\n\n## *It is almost always better to lend a Uni v3 position as a short ATM option rather than to hold it.*\n\nOur results suggest that Uni V3 positions are analogous to short put options, and that it would be better in most cases to lend it to an option buyer and collect premium rather than simply holding it and collecting fees.\n\nWhat does that imply? First, this suggests that establishing a healthy options market based on Uniswap v3 (or SushiSwap’s upcoming concentrated liquidity pools) would likely increase the yields collected by liquidity providers.\n\nSecond, not only would LPs generate more yields, but options \\*buyers \\*would also be able to protect their investments by purchasing put options that can permissionlessly be deployed at any strike and for any pairs. Options on ETH-stablecoin pairs can be efficiently handled by protocols like Opyn, Pods finance, or Lyra finance, but it would be challenging to set up smart contracts for the trading of options of each possible asset pairs that exists (tens of thousands of markets exist in Uniswap’s long tail end of crypto assets).\n\nFinally, there needs to be a cultural shift in the way people are interpreting the deployment of concentrated liquidity positions on Uniswap v3 or SushiSwap. While constant product AMMs are simpler to understand and manage, they can be prone to significant [impermanent loss](https://lambert-guillaume.medium.com/an-analysis-of-the-expected-value-of-the-impermanent-loss-in-uniswap-bfbfebbefed2?source=friends_link&sk=f9a43cb2f42e27ab0082a7490fd7d8d5) and are a very [inefficient use of capital](https://medium.com/blockchain-development-notes/uniswap-v3-maths-explained-capital-efficiency-86257c44405a) compared to concentrated liquidity AMMs.\n\nBeing on the short side of options trading is an inherently profitable endeavor (since implied volatility is often higher than the realized volatility), but managing a short options portfolio is not a buy-and-hold passive strategy. Short options, and by extension Uni v3 LP positions, have to be actively managed, but active investing does not mean watching charts and trading every minute of every day. With the right tools, being an active investor takes less than five minutes per day.\n\n\\*I wish to thank \\**[Lucas Kohorst](https://twitter.com/KohorstLucas)* *for their helpful comments.* *If you’re interested in these ideas please DM me on twitter @guil_lambert or send an email to guil.lambert @ protonmail.com .*", "timestamp": 1635074118, "digest": "iA5jcdyjj-6-qANfAoZoMSeQbpgfMvIdH7rADjr3J_A", "contributor": "0xFb4c6dF1C62C62fd956546E749821b4a2B4D278b"}
{"id": "KQiQ0SAxJiHeHYw1nl_xzhxOtINOzJIpl2kvzQF4LcY", "title": "Entendiendo el consenso en la KCC. ", "body": "**PoSA Proof of staked authority consensus**\n\nUna cadena de bloques es un sistema descentralizado peer-to-peer carente de una autoridad central. Si bien esto evita la corruptela propia de los centralismos, genera otros problemas tales como la toma de desiciones o la ejecución de las mismas.\n\nEn una organización centralizada, quien decide el rumbo de la misma es o bien un líder o bien un grupo de gobierno. Sin embargo en la cadena de bloques las desiciones se toman a través de un mecanismo de consenso.\n\n¿Esto qué implica? De manera sencilla, el consenso es una manera dinámica de llegar a un entendimiento entre los miembros de un grupo, si bien votando, se aplica la decisión de la mayoría, independientemente de los deseos o sentimientos de la minoría, el consenso por otra parte asegura que el acuerdo que se alcance pueda beneficiar a todos los que participan.\n\nTal como explica wikipedia, se denomina **consenso** al [acuerdo](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acuerdo) producido por consentimiento entre todos los miembros de un grupo o entre varios grupos. El disenso por otro lado es la falta de consenso. Una decisión por consenso, no implica que haya un consentimiento activo por parte de todos sus miembros, si no mas bien una aceptación por omisión, esto es por no negación.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1272/1\\*2rHxVU8mjsuBUQhacbCZ2g.png)\n\nAsí pues los objetivos del consenso son:\n\n**Colaboración:** Todos los participantes deben actuar juntos para encontrar el resultado que mejor represente los intereses del grupo.\n\n**Acuerdo general:** el mecanismo de consenso debe brindar al grupo el mayor acuerdo positivo entre todas las partes participantes.\n\n**Igualitario:** El voto de todas y cada una de las partes debe tener el mismo peso.\n\n**Cooperativo:** Todos los participantes deben buscar el bien común por encima del personal.\n\n**Inclusivo y participativo:** Todos los miembros afectados deben tomar parte en el mecanismo de consenso.\n\n## Tipos de Consenso en el blockchain\n\n\\*\\*Proof of work (PoW) o prueba de trabajo: \\*\\*es el mas antiguo protocolo de consenso en el blockchain consistente en que las partes de la red han de resolver con éxito un trabajo computacionalmente costoso para poder acceder a los accesos de la red. Este trabajo computacional lo realizan los mineros y de esta manera minan monedas como Bitcoin.\n\n**Proof of stake (PoS) o prueba de participación:** Este mecanismo permite sustituir a los mineros por validadores.\n\nPara llevar a cabo este mecanismo, los validadores tienen que bloquear sus activos, realizado esto, empiezan a validar los bloques, que una vez encontrados se incorporan a la cadena.\n\n**Proof of staked authority (PoSA)o prueba de participación por autoridad:** los validadores participan bloqueando cierto número de activos. Proponiendo un bloque valido y recibiendo cómo recompensas las transacciones contenidas en dicho bloque.\n\nNo se minan nuevas monedas, sino que las recompensas suponen las comisiones por las transacciones realizadas en dicho bloque.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*q6zoMk5FYnSLT1FRwrnwfA.png)\n\nEn el caso de KCC, el número de validadores activos esta limitado a 29, y solo los validadores activos están autorizados para validar las transacciones. Este número de solo 29 validadores autorizados está determinado por la cantidad de KCS que posean y la reputación de los mismos, pues está a su vez evaluada en función de su fiabilidad.\n\nLa fiabilidad de los validadores es fundamental para la fluidez, rapidez y escalabilidad de las transacciones y la red, (se mina un bloque cada tres segundos). Los 29 validadores con el mayor número de KCS van a ser los que validen los bloques, determinados una vez al día y almacenandose en la Kucoin Community Chain. Todo esto facilita además que las transacciones de la KCC sean de las mas baratas de todas las blockchains.\n\nEl mecanismo de consenso PoSA permite bloques cortos y de emisión rápida a bajo coste a cambio de sacrificar descentralización, debido a esto un usuario cualquiera no puede validar transacciones en la KCC como lo haría un usuario de Ethereum o Bitcoin.\n\n**Enlaces de KuCoin Community Chain y redes sociales**\n\nWeb: <https://www.kcc.io/>\n\nDocumentación: <https://docs.kcc.io/>\n\nExplorer: <https://explorer.kcc.io/>\n\n**Redes sociales**\n\nDiscord: <https://discord.gg/H5ucJydSyd>\n\nTwitter: <https://twitter.com/KCCOfficialTW>\n\nTelegram español: <https://t.me/KucoinSpanish>\n\nTelegram Channel: <https://t.me/KCCOfficialChannel>\n\nMedium: <https://kccofficial.medium.com/>", "timestamp": 1635075009, "digest": "_cXnsfyR-IUWKMhLmkYUt3CqSxEmSAXBkMm3wZZSk4A", "contributor": "0x0fB213a1Af101b1429e6aD3020ad92Fb0D25Eb1E"}

"日月是你，星辰是你，万物皆是你\n\n第一章夏日初遇\n\n夏竹是一名科幻漫画家。2017年，她35岁，这一年她出版了最新作品《圆》，引起了巨大的轰动，短短半年就被译为9种语言出版。其实，从25岁开始出版第一本科幻漫画《宇宙之战》开始，夏竹已经出版8部作品了，却都一直没有激起太大的水花。曾被喻为最年轻的美女漫画家，这些年却因为一直笔耕不辍，遭至江郎才尽的批评。这一次的《圆》是夏竹这些年对宇宙和人生思考的总和。与以往硬核科幻风格不同，里面对哲学、对语言理解，甚至有点禅宗的味道。\n\n这一天，夏竹受邀去北京参加国际科幻大会，会后现场还将举办《圆》的全语种签售会。\n\n中国科技馆会场外，盛夏的阳光夺神炫目，刺的眼睛都睁不开，蝉鸣声此起彼伏，声势宏大得仿佛是要向人类宣战，而毫不知情的人类撑着伞走进会场，丝毫不受高温天气的影响，每个人心中都充满了期待。\n\n会议很成功。除了科幻小说、科幻漫画作者，还有全球知名的物理学家、数学家们都参加了这次大会。会上，夏竹做了一篇关于非线性时间的演讲，从康德的哲学讲到了爱因斯坦的相对论，引起会场阵阵掌声。其实，夏竹在大学时期就是学的物理学专业，也曾是美女学霸。只是无意间在网上分享自己的四格漫画，一度在网络上走红，才选择了漫画这条路。一画就是十年。\n\n夏竹演讲完毕后是问答环节，各家记者举起自家名牌。夏竹向观众席望过去，一眼就看到了一个举着华西都市报的牌子的短发姑娘，她正充满期待地睁着大眼睛，特别的像一只可爱的。。。小黑兔。夏竹正惊讶于自己怎么会有如此冒犯的想法。这时主持人正好也选中了她提问。\n\n\"夏竹老师您好，我们都知道康德的时空观与爱因斯坦的时空理论有很大不同，尤其是时间概念。您能为我们详细分析一下吗？\"\n\n夏竹微笑着说道\"谢谢您的问题，在康德的哲学中，时间本身不是实在的，而爱因斯坦的相对论中，时间成为了可以伸缩的实在之物。这看似是完全不同的观点，但我认为，他们是殊途同归的，最终都指向了时间的非线性，也就是说，我们能感受到时间的流逝其实是不存在的。并不存在过去、现在和未来，\"时间\"概念被发明出来，只是用于社会协作，比如今天的会议在北京时间下午两点召开，如果没有时间，我们就无法聚集在这里了。因此时间是由我们内在感知塑造，所以康德并没有错，只是人们把爱因斯坦的相对论中的时空含义解释错了，时间本身无所谓变快变慢，只是用来度量时间的工具本身的运动变快变慢了；时间也是没有方向的，只是物体运动是有方向的。从这个意义上说，对于时间的理解，其实是康德和爱因斯坦两位伟人使用不同的证明方式中验证了同一个真理。\"\n\n会场再次响起掌声。会后是夏竹的新书签售会。之前没能入场的粉丝纷纷进入会场，一时间涌入好多人。夏竹的助理潇潇忙前忙后，一面负责叮嘱安保人员维持秩序，一面准备着夏竹需要的各类物品。从第四本作品出版开始，潇潇就成为了夏竹的助理，转眼已经五年了。潇潇和夏竹之间的默契可谓山鸣谷应，夏竹说了上一句，潇潇几乎能完全猜到下一句。更别说对彼此喜怒哀乐的心灵感应了。\n\n那天签售会结束后，还有不少粉丝一直留在休息室门口，等着夏竹。\n\n夏竹从休息室出来后，非常礼貌的也很得体的和大家打招呼。排在前面的是爱漫画杂志社的文宇，现在她旁边的同伴就是刚刚在会场提问的姑娘。\n\n隔近了看，其实能看出来她年龄也不小了，但就是散发出有一种天真和清澈，想让人靠近\n\n夏竹被她吸引住了，忍不住多看了几眼。准确的说，她留着快要齐肩的中发，乌黑顺直，和黑色的大眼睛搭配在一起，果然像一只机警的小黑兔，笑起来的时候更是十分灿烂。很快就轮到了她和文宇上前。\n\n经过了一翻寒暄与赞美，文宇终于开始做介绍。\n\n\"这位是童昕小姐，是华西都市报的记者。\"\n\n\"夏竹老师您好，我是您的读者，在《圆》这部作品中，我最喜欢中二怪这个角色\"\n\n听到这番话，夏竹内心既高兴又温暖，在童昕之前还没有读者喜欢中二怪这个角色的。比起中二怪，大家更喜欢拯救地球的男女主角，谁会在意一个已经成年还中二病的女人呢。而中二怪恰好是夏竹自己的另一面，人到中年，依然充满了浪漫、想象、常常也会横冲直撞、口不择言，和展示在公众面前的形象完全不同。\n\n\"是吗，很多读者说这个人物不太讨喜呢\"\n\n\"真的很喜欢，她不顾一切的样子，特别像《魂断威尼斯》里面的中年人，为了心中的理想宁可飞蛾扑火般的自我毁灭。我觉得她是最勇敢的。\"\n\n文宇看后面的队伍还排着长队，打趣童昕说\"一说起自己喜欢的漫画就停不下来啦，夏老师还忙，我们等会儿再过来\"\n\n夏竹笑了笑\"晚上我们有庆功宴，你们一起参加吧，就在旁边的U酒店。\"\n\n二人开心的答应下来。在会场后面的座位上等着夏竹。\n\n童昕自从2013年大学毕业后，一直在南方都市报工作。刚入职时，编辑部的李主任就特别看重这个文采斐然、大学时就在各类全国文学大赛中获奖的小姑娘，一直想让童昕到编辑部上班。但童昕是记者部的王海主任从传媒大学亲自招来的，且不说王主任为人强势绝不肯放手自己的人才，就连童昕这边也不会愿意换岗。几年来，她一直用努力工作回报王主任的知遇之恩，经过几年的并肩作战，也和王主任建立了深厚的革命友谊。但你可不要把童昕理解为言听必从之人，要是王主任在工作中安排的明显不合理，童昕对王主任既能怼又能撒娇，完全掌握了现在的时髦技能——\"向上管理\"。\n\n\"王主任又来电话了，明天下午有领导人来成都视察工作，问我明天能不能回去上班\"童昕对文宇说到。\n\n\"那你回去吗\"\n\n\"我当然回去了，这是我从民生组调到时事组以来最大的新闻了，多好的一次机会呀\"\n\n\"还是那个工作狂呀，到了北京都不多陪我两天。\"\n\n文宇是童昕在工作第二年认识的朋友，在一个葡萄酒商举办的酒会上，童昕作为南方都市报的记者受邀参加，其他来宾都是传媒圈的前辈们。而文宇则是那晚的品酒师，她留着一头干练的短发，穿着一身裤式西装，远看像一个男孩子呢，直到她走到宴会厅前面给大家讲解葡萄酒知识的时候才发现，她绝对是当晚颜值最高的姑娘：身材高挑，头身比极好，脸型和五官都很精致，是一个清秀的少年模样。若留一头长发，那必定是美若天仙。\n\n那天的晚宴上，传媒圈的精英们觥筹交错，把葡萄酒当茅台在喝，一时间人声鼎沸，喝倒了了一片，旁边拉小提琴的姑娘也放弃了演奏，因为根本听不到音乐声了。童昕想出去偷偷透口气，恰好看到了文宇正在和几个酒商喝酒，确切的说，是几个不怀好意的男人企图灌她酒，文宇一直在说我真的不能喝酒，我以茶代酒向各位赔罪。\"品酒师哪有不会喝酒的，是不是看不起我李大明\"。童昕看到这帮人不会放过她之后，向其中的一个酒商，也是今天活动的主办方李总走过去，说到，李总您好，我是南方都市报的童昕，之前我们见过面的。\"是童大记者啊，失敬失敬，之前您为咱们单桶麦芽威士忌写的专栏推荐很专业啊，我们公司销量从那个月开始就增加了20%呢\"\"这都是我应该做的，我要敬李总一杯，感谢李总今天精心准备的盛宴。\"\"我的荣幸，干杯\"\n\n\"我今天还学到了很多红酒知识呢\"童昕看向文宇说道，\"文宇小姐对红酒的解说很专业，我周末打算在家办一场家宴，想向文宇小姐请教红酒和菜品的搭配，可以吗\"\n\n文宇说，没问题呀，我慢慢给您讲，李总，我们失陪一下。\n\n童昕就这样为文宇解了围。\n\n文宇说\"刚才谢谢你啊，我几乎不能喝酒，小半杯红酒都会醉的不省人事\"\n\n童昕笑着说，\"没关系，我以前看到过新闻，说品酒师只需要品尝，并不需要喝进肚子里面，对吗\"\n\n\"是啊，我们在品酒的时候会准备一个\"吐酒桶\"，一款酒进入口中之后，就已经呈现了它的风味特征，对这款酒的感受，吐掉和咽下去没有太大的差别。可是我确实酒量太差了，得练习啊\"\n\n\"我正好挺喜欢喝红酒的，下次我们一起练习，你长酒量，我长知识，哈哈哈\"\n\n童昕把文宇逗乐了，一张又酷又美的脸笑起来还有一对酒窝，显得十分可爱。\n\n这天之后，两人成了好朋友，常常陪伴，偶尔约饭，只是几乎不喝酒。后来童昕才知道，品酒只是文宇的爱好，为此还考取了葡萄酒三级讲师，而她的日常工作其实是漫画杂志社的编辑。同行之间当然有更多的话题了。\n\n这次来北京参加国际科幻大会，也是文宇让童昕陪她一起去的，去之前一周还狠狠安利了夏竹的新漫画《圆》。没想到童昕不但看过这部漫画，还比自己更加痴迷。知道夏竹是文宇在北京的老朋友，童昕激动的像小迷妹一样手舞足蹈。\n\n这会儿他们正在会场靠后的座位上，看着偶像和读者们合影，童昕还是抑制不住的激动。文宇拉着她自拍发朋友圈，但童昕一直对朋友圈没什么兴趣，觉得整天将自己的生活展示给别人没啥意思。\n\n文宇说，你可以发一个仅对自己和我可见的朋友圈呀，开心的时刻值得保存下来，回忆嘛，有个载体更丰富。\n\n\"你说的有道理，但夏竹老师刚刚不是说了吗，时间是不存在的，也就没有过去和未来，只有当下，此时此刻\"\n\n\"那你怎么解释，随着时间的逝去，我们脸上长出的皱纹，这说明即使这种流动不叫\"时间\"，但依然是有方向的。\"\n\n这时候出现了夏竹的声音，\"这种说法也没错，但要注意，不是类似时间的东西在推着我们，而是我们在制造或者推动着时间\"不知什么时候，夏竹从人群中走到了两人旁边，看来已经停留了一会儿了。\"走吧，我们边走边聊\"\n\n三人一起往庆功宴所在酒店走去。\n\n走出会场，已经是黄昏了，看着夕阳下粉色的天空，童昕不禁感叹，夏天真美好啊。在这颗渺小的星球上，我们做了什么成为了谁重要吗，一切都敌不过夏天里吹过一阵温柔的风。\n\n文宇笑到，你看她那么佛系，对你可是痴狂呢，为了今天的活动还专门请了两天假。\n\n夏竹竟然一下子不好意思的红了脸，但是别人一定分不清楚这是因为高温还是害羞还是别的什么情绪。什么情绪呢，大概是一种让心跳加速的情绪，与这夏日暖风一起在心间温柔流动。\n\n走过一个路口就来到了酒店。与童昕想象的场面不同，不是高朋满座、觥筹交错的商务宴席，而是老友聚会。庆功宴只有5个人，同行的3人加上助理潇潇、物理学李教授，李教授也是夏竹的恩师。除了李教授在北京外，其他人都在成都生活。\n\n饭桌上，夏竹和台上的光芒万丈的气质不太一样，散发出一种知性柔和的魅力。在彼此还不熟络的时候，夏竹有趣的介绍很快就让氛围变得轻松愉快。大家都因为夏竹的幽默开怀大笑，而童昕不同，她笑是因为听到夏竹称自己是朋友，很久都没有这种心中涌起暖流的感觉了。\n\n大家很快熟悉起来了，夏竹还和李教授说起了学术问题，引发了大家的热烈讨论，聊得激动了还有人唱起了歌。所以几乎互不相识的聚会，但在笑声和歌声中，大家就像认识了很久一样。看着潇洒又可爱的夏竹，童昕不知为何突然有点自卑。她不是你的偶像吗，怎么会有这样的感觉呢？\n\n\"夏竹虽然是独立的内容创作者，但天生自带领导气质，既能光芒万丈，又能非常周到的照顾到所有人。而自己闯荡江湖这么多年，经历过那么多人事，还没有这么稳重成熟有趣，不免有些汗颜吧。。。。。也许是这样的吧\"童昕想着。不然呢？\n\n童昕还没从若有所思状态中回来，就听到了文宇聊到了自己\"童昕也是个才女呢，自己也在独立运营一个公众号，粉丝还不少，原本一直都是喜欢催更的事业粉，后来在微博上发了自己的照片之后还有女友粉了呢，那张照片童昕特别酷，女友粉都直接喊老公的。她们啊，要是知道童昕已经有未婚夫了，说不定还会很失落呢。。。。。\"\n\n夏竹没有听清楚文宇后面讲了些什么，光是听到“未婚夫”三个字，心脏就砰砰跳了。一旁的潇潇察觉了夏竹的异样，这么多年来夏竹从来都是反应迅速，思如泉涌的人，就像一只草原奔驰的小捷豹，还从来没有见过夏竹灵魂出窍、眼中无光的样子，是因为喝醉吗？潇潇敏感而忠诚，但不愿意承认自己捕捉到的这一点点微妙的变化。\n\n他们喝的是清酒，这是一家深藏在老牌五星级酒店的日式餐厅，暖色灯光将每个人的脸映照的特别亲切。\n\n夏竹见童昕向服务员要了一大份芥末。\n\n\"看来你很喜欢芥末\"\n\n\"这里的芥末是用新鲜山葵做的，就着刺身入口清凉呛鼻，味道很有层次感，让人很回味。你也试试呀\"\n\n\"我只能吃芥末的周边产品，比如芥末薯片，芥末味冰淇淋。我也遇到过一个很喜欢芥末的朋友。等我回成都了，我们一起聚一聚。\"\n\n\"好啊\"\n\n潇潇笑着望向夏竹，\"你说的是莹莹吧，她前两天还想让我搭线找你帮忙推荐日本的书商呢\"\n\n夏竹沉默了一会儿，她和莹莹曾经是多么要好的朋友啊。她俩曾是初高中同学，冬天一起去北方看雪，夏天一起去南边看海，失意时互相鼓励，得意时为彼此开心，可是后来啊，不知道为什么，莹莹每次有事相求才会找夏竹，甚至还要通过经纪人来联络。\n\n\"是吗，是褚雷最近有什么新作？\"\n\n\"他写了一本散文诗，莹莹在帮他做海外宣发。。。哎，以前你和莹莹那么要好，现在不知道怎么了\"\n\n夏竹依然像在开玩笑的插科打诨一样，\"哎呀，过去最不可信了，只有当下才重要\"\n\n潇潇说，\"可是人就是由过去、由回忆组成的啊，我还记得你第一次蹦极的时候还给我说，穿上蹦极服往下一看腿都被吓软了，后来想象着要是莹莹在旁边一定会鼓励自己，才有动力勇敢往下冲\"\n\n\"没有过去，也没有未来，我们的一生其实就像一幅很长的画一样，早就被画好了，只是总有些场景里有对的天气、对的心情，恰好就会遇到一些一直放在心底的人，友情、爱情都是这样。\"\n\n\"你说的话总是这么深奥。\"\n\n童昕看到夏竹的眉头似有若无的皱了一下，露出隐约的难过，似乎猜到了什么\"夏竹想说的是，过去、未来都不存在，因此时间不重要，但是时机很重要，对吗？\"\n\n\"是啊，人与人之间的一切都是时机\"\n\n\"爱是天时地利的迷信\"\n\n“对对”夏竹笑着点点头。\n\n\"说起来我下周五就要回成都了\"夏竹看着童昕说\n\n\"是长期定居成都了吗\"\n\n\"是啊，我可能会找一个郊区房子住，每天睡醒之后，吃饭、写作、逛街，然后当一个修禅玩家\"\n\n\"那太好了了，不过，我恰好下周又要到北京出差一个月\"\n\n童昕有些难过的低下了头，她刚刚说时机很重要，不是顺夏竹之意说的，而是她真的深信不疑。她好担心，由于自己去北京与夏竹天各一方，还没有及时建立起来的友谊，就又淡下去了。\n\n夏竹似乎看出来了她的担心，\"没关系，时机很重要，对的人更重要，我们还有微信可以联络\"\n\n那晚聚会结束之后，夏竹把童昕和文宇送上车，隔着车窗，她默默凝视童昕和司机说话的侧脸。那时，一个不相信未来的人，开始对人生画卷上未知的笔墨充满期待，而她知道，这些未知的笔墨一定会勾勒出这张灵动的侧脸。\n\n夏日的晚风温暖又湿润，看着长安街上的万家灯火，与潇潇呆在一起的夏竹，感受到了一丝孤独，这是她很多年都没有过的感受，或者说，因为习惯了而不会在意的感受。\n\n夏天的夜，第一次这么漫长。",

"日月是你，星辰是你，万物皆是你\n\n第一章夏日初遇\n\n夏竹是一名科幻漫画家。2017年，她35岁，这一年她出版了最新作品《圆》，引起了巨大的轰动，短短半年就被译为9种语言出版。其实，从25岁开始出版第一本科幻漫画《宇宙之战》开始，夏竹已经出版8部作品了，却都一直没有激起太大的水花。曾被喻为最年轻的美女漫画家，这些年却因为一直笔耕不辍，遭至江郎才尽的批评。这一次的《圆》是夏竹这些年对宇宙和人生思考的总和。与以往硬核科幻风格不同，里面对哲学、对语言理解，甚至有点禅宗的味道。\n\n这一天，夏竹受邀去北京参加国际科幻大会，会后现场还将举办《圆》的全语种签售会。\n\n中国科技馆会场外，盛夏的阳光夺神炫目，刺的眼睛都睁不开，蝉鸣声此起彼伏，声势宏大得仿佛是要向人类宣战，而毫不知情的人类撑着伞走进会场，丝毫不受高温天气的影响，每个人心中都充满了期待。\n\n会议很成功。除了科幻小说、科幻漫画作者，还有全球知名的物理学家、数学家们都参加了这次大会。会上，夏竹做了一篇关于非线性时间的演讲，从康德的哲学讲到了爱因斯坦的相对论，引起会场阵阵掌声。其实，夏竹在大学时期就是学的物理学专业，也曾是美女学霸。只是无意间在网上分享自己的四格漫画，一度在网络上走红，才选择了漫画这条路。一画就是十年。\n\n夏竹演讲完毕后是问答环节，各家记者举起自家名牌。夏竹向观众席望过去，一眼就看到了一个举着华西都市报的牌子的短发姑娘，她正充满期待地睁着大眼睛，特别的像一只可爱的。。。小黑兔。夏竹正惊讶于自己怎么会有如此冒犯的想法。这时主持人正好也选中了她提问。\n\n\"夏竹老师您好，我们都知道康德的时空观与爱因斯坦的时空理论有很大不同，尤其是时间概念。您能为我们详细分析一下吗？\"\n\n夏竹微笑着说道\"谢谢您的问题，在康德的哲学中，时间本身不是实在的，而爱因斯坦的相对论中，时间成为了可以伸缩的实在之物。这看似是完全不同的观点，但我认为，他们是殊途同归的，最终都指向了时间的非线性，也就是说，我们能感受到时间的流逝其实是不存在的。并不存在过去、现在和未来，\"时间\"概念被发明出来，只是用于社会协作，比如今天的会议在北京时间下午两点召开，如果没有时间，我们就无法聚集在这里了。因此时间是由我们内在感知塑造，所以康德并没有错，只是人们把爱因斯坦的相对论中的时空含义解释错了，时间本身无所谓变快变慢，只是用来度量时间的工具本身的运动变快变慢了；时间也是没有方向的，只是物体运动是有方向的。从这个意义上说，对于时间的理解，其实是康德和爱因斯坦两位伟人使用不同的证明方式中验证了同一个真理。\"\n\n会场再次响起掌声。会后是夏竹的新书签售会。之前没能入场的粉丝纷纷进入会场，一时间涌入好多人。夏竹的助理潇潇忙前忙后，一面负责叮嘱安保人员维持秩序，一面准备着夏竹需要的各类物品。从第四本作品出版开始，潇潇就成为了夏竹的助理，转眼已经五年了。潇潇和夏竹之间的默契可谓山鸣谷应，夏竹说了上一句，潇潇几乎能完全猜到下一句。更别说对彼此喜怒哀乐的心灵感应了。\n\n那天签售会结束后，还有不少粉丝一直留在休息室门口，等着夏竹。\n\n夏竹从休息室出来后，非常礼貌的也很得体的和大家打招呼。排在前面的是爱漫画杂志社的文宇，现在她旁边的同伴就是刚刚在会场提问的姑娘。\n\n隔近了看，其实能看出来她年龄也不小了，但就是散发出有一种天真和清澈，想让人靠近\n\n夏竹被她吸引住了，忍不住多看了几眼。准确的说，她留着快要齐肩的中发，乌黑顺直，和黑色的大眼睛搭配在一起，果然像一只机警的小黑兔，笑起来的时候更是十分灿烂。很快就轮到了她和文宇上前。\n\n经过了一翻寒暄与赞美，文宇终于开始做介绍。\n\n\"这位是童昕小姐，是华西都市报的记者。\"\n\n\"夏竹老师您好，我是您的读者，在《圆》这部作品中，我最喜欢中二怪这个角色\"\n\n听到这番话，夏竹内心既高兴又温暖，在童昕之前还没有读者喜欢中二怪这个角色的。比起中二怪，大家更喜欢拯救地球的男女主角，谁会在意一个已经成年还中二病的女人呢。而中二怪恰好是夏竹自己的另一面，人到中年，依然充满了浪漫、想象、常常也会横冲直撞、口不择言，和展示在公众面前的形象完全不同。\n\n\"是吗，很多读者说这个人物不太讨喜呢\"\n\n\"真的很喜欢，她不顾一切的样子，特别像《魂断威尼斯》里面的中年人，为了心中的理想宁可飞蛾扑火般的自我毁灭。我觉得她是最勇敢的。\"\n\n文宇看后面的队伍还排着长队，打趣童昕说\"一说起自己喜欢的漫画就停不下来啦，夏老师还忙，我们等会儿再过来\"\n\n夏竹笑了笑\"晚上我们有庆功宴，你们一起参加吧，就在旁边的U酒店。\"\n\n二人开心的答应下来。在会场后面的座位上等着夏竹。\n\n童昕自从2013年大学毕业后，一直在南方都市报工作。刚入职时，编辑部的李主任就特别看重这个文采斐然、大学时就在各类全国文学大赛中获奖的小姑娘，一直想让童昕到编辑部上班。但童昕是记者部的王海主任从传媒大学亲自招来的，且不说王主任为人强势绝不肯放手自己的人才，就连童昕这边也不会愿意换岗。几年来，她一直用努力工作回报王主任的知遇之恩，经过几年的并肩作战，也和王主任建立了深厚的革命友谊。但你可不要把童昕理解为言听必从之人，要是王主任在工作中安排的明显不合理，童昕对王主任既能怼又能撒娇，完全掌握了现在的时髦技能——\"向上管理\"。\n\n\"王主任又来电话了，明天下午有领导人来成都视察工作，问我明天能不能回去上班\"童昕对文宇说到。\n\n\"那你回去吗\"\n\n\"我当然回去了，这是我从民生组调到时事组以来最大的新闻了，多好的一次机会呀\"\n\n\"还是那个工作狂呀，到了北京都不多陪我两天。\"\n\n文宇是童昕在工作第二年认识的朋友，在一个葡萄酒商举办的酒会上，童昕作为南方都市报的记者受邀参加，其他来宾都是传媒圈的前辈们。而文宇则是那晚的品酒师，她留着一头干练的短发，穿着一身裤式西装，远看像一个男孩子呢，直到她走到宴会厅前面给大家讲解葡萄酒知识的时候才发现，她绝对是当晚颜值最高的姑娘：身材高挑，头身比极好，脸型和五官都很精致，是一个清秀的少年模样。若留一头长发，那必定是美若天仙。\n\n那天的晚宴上，传媒圈的精英们觥筹交错，把葡萄酒当茅台在喝，一时间人声鼎沸，喝倒了了一片，旁边拉小提琴的姑娘也放弃了演奏，因为根本听不到音乐声了。童昕想出去偷偷透口气，恰好看到了文宇正在和几个酒商喝酒，确切的说，是几个不怀好意的男人企图灌她酒，文宇一直在说我真的不能喝酒，我以茶代酒向各位赔罪。\"品酒师哪有不会喝酒的，是不是看不起我李大明\"。童昕看到这帮人不会放过她之后，向其中的一个酒商，也是今天活动的主办方李总走过去，说到，李总您好，我是南方都市报的童昕，之前我们见过面的。\"是童大记者啊，失敬失敬，之前您为咱们单桶麦芽威士忌写的专栏推荐很专业啊，我们公司销量从那个月开始就增加了20%呢\"\"这都是我应该做的，我要敬李总一杯，感谢李总今天精心准备的盛宴。\"\"我的荣幸，干杯\"\n\n\"我今天还学到了很多红酒知识呢\"童昕看向文宇说道，\"文宇小姐对红酒的解说很专业，我周末打算在家办一场家宴，想向文宇小姐请教红酒和菜品的搭配，可以吗\"\n\n文宇说，没问题呀，我慢慢给您讲，李总，我们失陪一下。\n\n童昕就这样为文宇解了围。\n\n文宇说\"刚才谢谢你啊，我几乎不能喝酒，小半杯红酒都会醉的不省人事\"\n\n童昕笑着说，\"没关系，我以前看到过新闻，说品酒师只需要品尝，并不需要喝进肚子里面，对吗\"\n\n\"是啊，我们在品酒的时候会准备一个\"吐酒桶\"，一款酒进入口中之后，就已经呈现了它的风味特征，对这款酒的感受，吐掉和咽下去没有太大的差别。可是我确实酒量太差了，得练习啊\"\n\n\"我正好挺喜欢喝红酒的，下次我们一起练习，你长酒量，我长知识，哈哈哈\"\n\n童昕把文宇逗乐了，一张又酷又美的脸笑起来还有一对酒窝，显得十分可爱。\n\n这天之后，两人成了好朋友，常常陪伴，偶尔约饭，只是几乎不喝酒。后来童昕才知道，品酒只是文宇的爱好，为此还考取了葡萄酒三级讲师，而她的日常工作其实是漫画杂志社的编辑。同行之间当然有更多的话题了。\n\n这次来北京参加国际科幻大会，也是文宇让童昕陪她一起去的，去之前一周还狠狠安利了夏竹的新漫画《圆》。没想到童昕不但看过这部漫画，还比自己更加痴迷。知道夏竹是文宇在北京的老朋友，童昕激动的像小迷妹一样手舞足蹈。\n\n这会儿他们正在会场靠后的座位上，看着偶像和读者们合影，童昕还是抑制不住的激动。文宇拉着她自拍发朋友圈，但童昕一直对朋友圈没什么兴趣，觉得整天将自己的生活展示给别人没啥意思。\n\n文宇说，你可以发一个仅对自己和我可见的朋友圈呀，开心的时刻值得保存下来，回忆嘛，有个载体更丰富。\n\n\"你说的有道理，但夏竹老师刚刚不是说了吗，时间是不存在的，也就没有过去和未来，只有当下，此时此刻\"\n\n\"那你怎么解释，随着时间的逝去，我们脸上长出的皱纹，这说明即使这种流动不叫\"时间\"，但依然是有方向的。\"\n\n这时候出现了夏竹的声音，\"这种说法也没错，但要注意，不是类似时间的东西在推着我们，而是我们在制造或者推动着时间\"不知什么时候，夏竹从人群中走到了两人旁边，看来已经停留了一会儿了。\"走吧，我们边走边聊\"\n\n三人一起往庆功宴所在酒店走去。\n\n走出会场，已经是黄昏了，看着夕阳下粉色的天空，童昕不禁感叹，夏天真美好啊。在这颗渺小的星球上，我们做了什么成为了谁重要吗，一切都敌不过夏天里吹过一阵温柔的风。\n\n文宇笑到，你看她那么佛系，对你可是痴狂呢，为了今天的活动还专门请了两天假。\n\n夏竹竟然一下子不好意思的红了脸，但是别人一定分不清楚这是因为高温还是害羞还是别的什么情绪。什么情绪呢，大概是一种让心跳加速的情绪，与这夏日暖风一起在心间温柔流动。\n\n走过一个路口就来到了酒店。与童昕想象的场面不同，不是高朋满座、觥筹交错的商务宴席，而是老友聚会。庆功宴只有5个人，同行的3人加上助理潇潇、物理学李教授，李教授也是夏竹的恩师。除了李教授在北京外，其他人都在成都生活。\n\n饭桌上，夏竹和台上的光芒万丈的气质不太一样，散发出一种知性柔和的魅力。在彼此还不熟络的时候，夏竹有趣的介绍很快就让氛围变得轻松愉快。大家都因为夏竹的幽默开怀大笑，而童昕不同，她笑是因为听到夏竹称自己是朋友，很久都没有这种心中涌起暖流的感觉了。\n\n大家很快熟悉起来了，夏竹还和李教授说起了学术问题，引发了大家的热烈讨论，聊得激动了还有人唱起了歌。所以几乎互不相识的聚会，但在笑声和歌声中，大家就像认识了很久一样。看着潇洒又可爱的夏竹，童昕不知为何突然有点自卑。她不是你的偶像吗，怎么会有这样的感觉呢？\n\n\"夏竹虽然是独立的内容创作者，但天生自带领导气质，既能光芒万丈，又能非常周到的照顾到所有人。而自己闯荡江湖这么多年，经历过那么多人事，还没有这么稳重成熟有趣，不免有些汗颜吧。。。。。也许是这样的吧\"童昕想着。不然呢？\n\n童昕还没从若有所思状态中回来，就听到了文宇聊到了自己\"童昕也是个才女呢，自己也在独立运营一个公众号，粉丝还不少，原本一直都是喜欢催更的事业粉，后来在微博上发了自己的照片之后还有女友粉了呢，那张照片童昕特别酷，女友粉都直接喊老公的。她们啊，要是知道童昕已经有未婚夫了，说不定还会很失落呢。。。。。\"\n\n夏竹没有听清楚文宇后面讲了些什么，光是听到“未婚夫”三个字，心脏就砰砰跳了。一旁的潇潇察觉了夏竹的异样，这么多年来夏竹从来都是反应迅速，思如泉涌的人，就像一只草原奔驰的小捷豹，还从来没有见过夏竹灵魂出窍、眼中无光的样子，是因为喝醉吗？潇潇敏感而忠诚，但不愿意承认自己捕捉到的这一点点微妙的变化。\n\n他们喝的是清酒，这是一家深藏在老牌五星级酒店的日式餐厅，暖色灯光将每个人的脸映照的特别亲切。\n\n夏竹见童昕向服务员要了一大份芥末。\n\n\"看来你很喜欢芥末\"\n\n\"这里的芥末是用新鲜山葵做的，就着刺身入口清凉呛鼻，味道很有层次感，让人很回味。你也试试呀\"\n\n\"我只能吃芥末的周边产品，比如芥末薯片，芥末味冰淇淋。我也遇到过一个很喜欢芥末的朋友。等我回成都了，我们一起聚一聚。\"\n\n\"好啊\"\n\n潇潇笑着望向夏竹，\"你说的是莹莹吧，她前两天还想让我搭线找你帮忙推荐日本的书商呢\"\n\n夏竹沉默了一会儿，她和莹莹曾经是多么要好的朋友啊。她俩曾是初高中同学，冬天一起去北方看雪，夏天一起去南边看海，失意时互相鼓励，得意时为彼此开心，可是后来啊，不知道为什么，莹莹每次有事相求才会找夏竹，甚至还要通过经纪人来联络。\n\n\"是吗，是褚雷最近有什么新作？\"\n\n\"他写了一本散文诗，莹莹在帮他做海外宣发。。。哎，以前你和莹莹那么要好，现在不知道怎么了\"\n\n夏竹依然像在开玩笑的插科打诨一样，\"哎呀，过去最不可信了，只有当下才重要\"\n\n潇潇说，\"可是人就是由过去、由回忆组成的啊，我还记得你第一次蹦极的时候还给我说，穿上蹦极服往下一看腿都被吓软了，后来想象着要是莹莹在旁边一定会鼓励自己，才有动力勇敢往下冲\"\n\n\"没有过去，也没有未来，我们的一生其实就像一幅很长的画一样，早就被画好了，只是总有些场景里有对的天气、对的心情，恰好就会遇到一些一直放在心底的人，友情、爱情都是这样。\"\n\n\"你说的话总是这么深奥。\"\n\n童昕看到夏竹的眉头似有若无的皱了一下，露出隐约的难过，似乎猜到了什么\"夏竹想说的是，过去、未来都不存在，因此时间不重要，但是时机很重要，对吗？\"\n\n\"是啊，人与人之间的一切都是时机\"\n\n\"爱是天时地利的迷信\"\n\n“对对”夏竹笑着点点头。\n\n\"说起来我下周五就要回成都了\"夏竹看着童昕说\n\n\"是长期定居成都了吗\"\n\n\"是啊，我可能会找一个郊区房子住，每天睡醒之后，吃饭、写作、逛街，然后当一个修禅玩家\"\n\n\"那太好了了，不过，我恰好下周又要到北京出差一个月\"\n\n童昕有些难过的低下了头，她刚刚说时机很重要，不是顺夏竹之意说的，而是她真的深信不疑。她好担心，由于自己去北京与夏竹天各一方，还没有及时建立起来的友谊，就又淡下去了。\n\n夏竹似乎看出来了她的担心，\"没关系，时机很重要，对的人更重要，我们还有微信可以联络\"\n\n那晚聚会结束之后，夏竹把童昕和文宇送上车，隔着车窗，她默默凝视童昕和司机说话的侧脸。那时，一个不相信未来的人，开始对人生画卷上未知的笔墨充满期待，而她知道，这些未知的笔墨一定会勾勒出这张灵动的侧脸。\n\n夏日的晚风温暖又湿润，看着长安街上的万家灯火，与潇潇呆在一起的夏竹，感受到了一丝孤独，这是她很多年都没有过的感受，或者说，因为习惯了而不会在意的感受。\n\n夏天的夜，第一次这么漫长。",

{"id": "jJeE4GBSUXGNRceity3So33uv4mAuLpov2J79gnPbWs", "title": "NFT Summary Sunday #2 - 24 October 2021", "body": "# NFT Summary Sunday #2 - 24 October\n\nWelcome back to the second edition of Summary Sunday, where we cover the major events that happened in the NFT metaverse since the last edition. This past week has had several major drops and a few little scandals, and for a few days we saw a lot of despair that NFTs were about to enter a bear market before Bitcoin claimed and then lost a new all-time high, leading to rallies across the board.\n\nLet's dive into some of the major events of the past week.\n\n\n---\n\n## Doodles\n\n![The launch went smoothly and the floor price is way up, but allegations of insider dealing have left a bad taste in the mouths of those who were unable to snag a Doodle on mint day.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VEK5NJanJmeEpyTFdMXPt.png?height=1800&width=1800)\n\nThe digital artist known as Burnt Toast dropped his much-anticipated \"Doodles\" 10k collection, minting for 0.123 ETH per item. As of the time of this writing, the floor is 1.35 ETH, meaning minters were able to claim at least a 10x return on investment within a single week! However, this mint was not without its controversies as the whitelist did not seem to be apportioned entirely equitably. Many notable Crypto Twitter influencers found themselves on the whitelists without having to jump through the same hoops that average users had to just to be whitelisted.\n\nThat being said, making a 10x ROI within a week while reaching 12.1k ETH volume is an indicator of a very strong launch and potentially a decent floor long-term. The question is, once the hype dies down will demand hold the floor steady, or will people take aggressive profits in chasing the next big mint? If it's the former, then that could be an indicator that NFT appreciation is still in full-swing, whereas if the floor drops out and the hype moves on, this could instead indicate frothiness in the market meaning that speculation is in full swing - indicating that the NFT market is in the later stages of a bubble.\n\nOf course, the success of one project doesn't make or break an entire market, but if we see massive floor pumps followed by equally massive dumps, that's a strong indication of pump-and-dump mentality of buyers, meaning a lack of long-term confidence may be preventing quality projects from sustaining their price floors.\n\nI'll be keeping my eye on Doodle, particularly because I love the pastel colors and art, and will be attempting to buy one around the 1 ETH mark. If it starts to take off again above 1.5 I may FOMO in just because I want one desperately for a backup PFP, but we'll have to see what the market dictates in the near future.\n\n```\nMint price: 0.123\nCurrent floor: 1.35\nCurrent ROI: 10.97x or 997%\nLong-term floor price target: 2-4 ETH\n```\n\n\n---\n\n## RareBunniClub\n\n![RareBunni is a recently launched, yet-to-be revealed \"cute bunny\" PFP project with strong community support from some very well-known NFT clubs.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qlNZYCinZADUYUMp8JROUDMwK3dGWHboRqoJpAEC37FuZtgT1syJuVXk-iwHV5lssaLh7bY7f6wveIGeAckJMk0KWtTrUZJNuIGVXA=s0)\n\nBefore we dive into RariBunniClub, we should first talk about what a DAO is. Many of you might have seen the term “DAO” before, but you’ve probably seen that term very recently. A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization, or essentially a club whose finances and operations exist on the blockchain, instead of via bank accounts. \n\nMany NFT projects are operating as DAOs, meaning you gain access to the organization by owning one of their NFTs, and one of the most popular NFT DAOs is CyberKongzBets (CKB), a play on the subreddit “WallStreetBets” famous for pumping the Gamestop and AMC stocks during an epic short squeeze earlier in 2021. CKB is a private Discord server for the owners of CyberKongz (see below), a pixelated ape PFP NFT. CKB is well-known in the NFT community for being home to many well-known traders and NFT flippers, and is closely watched by the broader NFT community to see what projects they are purchasing. \n\n![CyberKongz is well-known in the NFT community for having members with deep pockets and an affinity for finding quality PFP projects and \"sweeping the floors\" of upcoming projects in an attempt to make these projects more popular.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WjG6CxWcDQ2nOp0pc27M2.png?height=680&width=680)\n\nEarlier this month we saw the “Kongz,” as they are referred to, sweeping the floor of a few projects, notably [Bitbones](https://www.opensea.io/collectio/thefearface-bitbones) (see my profile picture for an example of a Bitbones). NFT wallet watchers keep track of Kongz’s activities and often try to chase those purchases to get in on the pump. While Kongz is not the only NFT DAO to do so, it is certainly one of the better-known projects.\n\nThis brings us to **RareBunniClub**, the most recent project that Kongz is suspected of coordinating large floor sweeps. Because RareBunni’s are not revealed yet, it is somewhat risky to purchase one pre-reveal, but if the Kongz have it their way this project could see a big pump post-reveal. Just be sure to take profits if you hold more than one, as we don’t know how the art will turn out!\n\n```\nRareBunniClub mint: 0.04 ETH\nPre-reveal floor: 0.09 ETH\nReveal date: Monday, 25 October (late evening, time TBA)\nPost-reveal floor estimation: Unknown, could see a pump up to 0.4 ETH or so.\n```\n\n\n---\n\n## HeadDAO\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6J5nB5XWbtZRTHcf9JdBP.png?height=320&width=320)\n\nSpeaking of NFT DAOs, another big project that launched this past week was [HeadDAO](https://www.opensea.io/collection/headdao), a new NFT project launched by 16 year old [Shamdoo.eth](https://www.twitter.com/TheShamdoo). Shamdoo is clearly a knowledgeable crypto-native even for his age, and has deftly created a sold-out project that quickly raised over 125 ETH to their treasury (coming from commissions of sales) with the purpose of using the community treasury to purchase valuable blue-chip NFT projects for community ownership. \n\nSuch a concept is not new, but for a 16 year old to lead thousands of internet strangers towards the goal of community ownership of quality digital art is pretty impressive. However, there’s a few things to discuss (this is where the scientist in me comes out) regarding some pitfalls of DAO ownership:\n\n* DAOs are *hard* to truly decentralized. If there’s a community treasury fund in control of a single individual (or small group of individuals) this is not a truly decentralized organization.\n* Decentralizing a DAO’s treasury requires some advanced cryptographic and programming knowledge, and DAO operations and politics can quickly scale to a high level of complexity. It’s important for DAOs to clearly define their goals, roles, and operations to avoid drama.\n* If somebody joins the DAO and later leaves, do they still retain partial ownership of the NFTs their royalties purchased? Most of the time the answer is no, and while I’m not advocating for reform, it’s important for people to realize that DAO membership doesn’t necessarily guarantee proportional ownership of the DAO’s assets. \n\nNow, for those that don’t know me I’m a grad student researcher at an academic institution for decentralization and blockchain research, therefore I often have some highly skeptical takes on certain concepts, and DAOs are my bread and butter. I’ve been studying them for almost 4 years and they’re still a very nascent technology. However, as the cryptosphere and metaverse continue to grow, DAOs will only become more popular over time.\n\n**Back to the project at hand,** HeadDAO minted for a cheap price of 0.055 ETH and is already at a floor of 0.58, providing a healthy 10x return for investors. Due to the DAO mechanics, the well-known persona of Shamdoo in the NFT space, and the desire for community in the metaverse, I anticipate HeadDAO to continue to grow in the short/medium term. \n\nTheir current shared assets include the following blue-chip NFTs:\n\n![CoolCat #5538 was acquired for 9.4 ETH](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E7ZbjUCiIz_J78ZCJMg9a.png?height=600&width=600)\n\n![These 3 CrypToadz were acquired for a total of 20.76 ETH](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RGTIPTYU640I3EBveFoGU.png?height=462&width=833)\n\n![This Genesis CyberKong (remember them?) was acquired for over 97 ETH!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NFvKBtJyfoqYEaVPajJb3.png?height=600&width=600)\n\nThis project is obviously going places, and with a floor of 0.58 this isn’t a bad opportunity to join the club and reap some of the profits!\n\n```\n\nHeadDAO mint price: 0.055 ETH\nCurrent floor: 0.58 ETH\nCurrent ROI: ~10x, or 900%\n```\n\n \n\n\n---\n\nI’m going to leave you here as I’m about to run to see a film this evening, so unfortunately I don’t have time to cover all of the amazing honorable mentions of the past week. If you have questions and want to know my thoughts on any projects, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/plAIgrounds) or on Discord at Zomboy#2590.\n\nSee you next time!", "timestamp": 1635083706, "digest": "wxzIh7Q9EgXBU0KY18ASHqqfe590mgb4wohLa3_gzOM", "contributor": "0x940653d9C5076d2FDfd44F7BC8e66aeb5Fb598BE"}

"**by-**自然选择实验室\n\n**摘要---受原始RSS协议启发，一种包含了社交图谱和密码学认证的新协议被提出。RSS3包含所有权、配置文件、链接和项目等属性，以及用户在一些应用程序中发布的内容。为了禁止中心化文件托管的可能性，RSS3引入了基于IPFS协议的点对点托管。开放和去中心化的系统改变了数据所有权的结构，大大有利于用户和开发人员。用户将完全控制自己的数据，而应用程序可以平等地访问公共用户生成的内容，以提供更好的整体用户体验。新协议将支持流行的社交和内容网络，同时它的模块化允许构建强大的中间件，进一步增强其他类型的应用程序。**\n\n# 1.背景\n\n原始RSS是第一个被大规模采用的网络聚合器。这是对Web1.0时代“互联网精神”的完美诠释。它是开放、中立的和去中心化的。然而，随着中心化社交媒体平台的兴起，RSS的使用在Web2.0时代急剧下降。\n\n在过去二十年中，内容和链接的控制逐渐被几个中心化的数据超级大国实现，然后这些超级大国滥用其垄断地位进行作恶：\n\n•他们侵犯了我们的隐私——例如，Facebook未经Cambridge Analytica同意就分享数百万用户的个人数据做政治广告。\n\n•他们盗用利润——例如，社交媒体平台的广告收入超过41.5美元，仅2020年一年就有10亿美元。\n\n•他们协助并进行审查——例如，中国主要社交媒体平台禁止主流加密交易所的关键词。\n\n•他们滥用算法-例如，社交媒体应用程序使用算法故意造成用户上瘾。\n\n•他们不鼓励创新——例如，没有开发人员可以创建一个像数据垄断公司那样具有竞争力的应用程序。\n\n \n\n让超级大国“不作恶”的努力被证明是徒劳的。似乎需要一个“不能作恶”的体系。\n\n为了创造一个社交和内容网络自由、平等、繁荣的世界，需要一个去中心化的生态系统。作为Web 3.0运动的一部分，它从三个主要原则开始：\n\n•开源：所有源代码都应提供给每个人审查；\n\n•民主治理：生态系统的规则应在民主制度下制定；\n\n•分布式控制：理想情况下，应将控制权分配给每一个参与者，并考虑其贡献；\n\n \n\n为了使新的去中心化生态系统达到足够的规模，推翻现有的中心化生态系统，我们还需要：\n\n• 包容性：应支持不同类型的现有和未来可能的应用；\n\n• 中立：底层协议不应偏向特定应用；\n\n• 激励：用户、内容创建者和开发者应该给予转换的实质性激励；\n\n以前的点对点系统中有很多成功的公共内容分发想法，例如BitMessage或ZeroNet引入的广播和订阅功能，重点是站点分发。但是，这些系统，包括最初的RSS标准，不包括允许用户之间进行社交互动的规定。虽然Peergos或Mastodon等其他社交网络系统也支持信息发布，\n\n它们要么专注于私有信息的分发，要么由于架构的多样性而倾向于生成超级节点。\n\nRSS3源于RSS的精华，它是一个协议，它允许用户控制自己的数据，开发人员可以轻松构建去中心化的内容和社交网络。\n\n# 2.RSS3标准\n\n一切都从RSS3标准开始。与最初的RSS标准相比，RSS3更轻便、更简单、更强大、更高效、更可扩展。具体而言，RSS3在以下方面有所不同：\n\n•文件格式从XML更改为JSON，以简化和高效；\n\n•加密密钥被用于验证和认证文件，确保数据完整性和所有权；\n\n•文件通过链接和反向链接连接；\n\n•实现与上游和上下文的内容交互；\n\n•不同的mime类型支持不同形式的内容\n\n•下一个项目和下一个列表用于支持历史记录；\n\nRSS3文件被设计为包含五种基本属性：\n\n•信息属性：文件的基本信息，如id、版本、更新日期等；\n\n•所有权属性：用于加密验证所有权的变量；\n\n•配置文件属性：身份信息-如头像、昵称和兴趣。私有属性是加密的；\n\n•链接属性：与其他RSS3文件的关系。多种类型的关系可以被不同用途的应用程序所定义；\n\n•项目属性：文件所有者发布的所有项目。与原始RSS类似，此处仅存储元数据和指针；\n\n \n\n与最初的RSS不同，RSS只提供最新的项目，引入了“项目链”来创建项目文件的链接列表，完全由文件所有者控制。\n\n对于更复杂的用例，应用程序可以在用户同意的情况下添加自定义变量。有关更多详细信息，请访问https://github.com/NaturalSelectionLabs/RSS3.\n\n# 3.托管\n\n## 3.1概述\n\nRSS3托管是一个为RSS3协议服务的点对点系统。一般来说，在这个系统中有三方：节点、用户和第三方应用程序。通常，用户指的是角色背后的真实人物，他们在多个平台上运行节点客户端，包括服务器、笔记本电脑、移动电话甚至嵌入式系统，这些平台都是点对点连接的。核心托管部分最强调的是让用户完全控制和访问他们的数据，应该是一个通用的共享分布式系统。因此，它与应用层解耦，这让用户可以自由切换应用程序，并给开发人员足够的灵活性。开发者可以在分布式节点上自由构建具有友好前端UI的第三方应用程序，这些节点可以是移动应用程序、桌面应用程序、浏览器扩展程序，或其他任何东西。关于中间件和第三方应用程序的进一步讨论见第五节和第六节。\n\n每个托管节点包含三个组件，如图2所示：（1）作为全局文件存储系统的固定内容存储（IPFS），（2）指向RSS3文件或帖子的CID的RSS3指针，以及（3）通信模块，负责将RSS3指针与其他节点同步并处理最终用户查询。\n\n## 3.2固定内容储存\n\n从理论上讲，可以使用本地文件存储系统作为存储基础，但在实践中，它可能会阻碍可扩展性。因此，我们提出了一种系统，其中所有节点都使用固定内容存储系统IPFS，这意味着所有RSS3文件都存储在IPFS上。每个RSS3文件都应该是可读写的，任何角色都有特定的限制。因此，存储系统不应该有基于角色的访问控制，因此IPFS是一个理想的选择。此外，不同于Arweave，IPFS不需要节点与之交互的令牌，这使得最终用户和开发人员能够更灵活、更容易地开始使用它。\n\n## 3.3 RSS3指针\n\n因为我们只能用CID在IPFS上搜索，所以需要一些索引表。默认情况下，每个节点承载从用户地址到用户RSS3文件的CID的映射。由所有节点承载的表构成全局分布的表。\n\n此外，针对不同模块的特定用途，还将提供可选的索引表，第六节将对此进行进一步讨论\n\n将来，可以鼓励节点索引和存储索引值。\n\n## 3.4通信模块\n\n一方面，来自最终用户或第三方应用程序的查询将由通信模块处理。通常，有两种类型的查询：post和subscribe。一旦节点查询订阅RSS3文件，通信模块将首先从分布式RSS3文件表中查找CID，然后从IPFS查询整个RSS3文件，最后还回来。一旦节点查询发布消息，在验证之后，它将更新分布式RSS3文件表。一些高级查询（包括更新索引主题列表或订阅主题）共享类似的工作流。\n\n为了维护分布式表，不同节点之间必须进行通信。表上的每个更新都将被广播，接收更新的节点将进行数据完整性验证。如果比现有版本更新，则节点将更新其本地版本。\n\n从物理上讲，每个节点都可以在远程服务器、个人计算机甚至嵌入式系统上运行。对于公共IP，通信非常简单。对于私有IP，我们使用中继进行NAT遍历。具体来说，对于支持IPv6的用户，可以在IPv6上建立连接。此外，为了最大限度地提高信息流量，还将支持Wi-Fi和蓝牙连接。\n\n## 3.5可扩展性\n\n对于对等系统，必须考虑可伸缩性。对于存储层，IPFS可以保证可扩展性。由于RSS3文件只包含元数据，因此将有足够的磁盘空间用于冗余。与此同时，IPFS社区同样致力于提高可扩展性。因此存储层的可扩展性不应构成挑战。\n\n就RSS3指针而言，由于任何CID都小于64字节，且20字节以太坊兼容地址被用作用户公共地址，因此RSS3文件表的一个条目应小于84字节。假设我们为这个表分配了1GB的空间，我们可以在这个空间中保存1200万个条目。但我们预计RSS3主机将有数十亿\n\n将来可能需要TB甚至更多空间的条目的数量。解决这个问题的一种方法是使用自聚合方法创建子对等组，从BitMessage中学习。\n\n# 4.所有权\n\n随着RSS3的引入，数据所有权得到了重组。用户通常有两种类型的数据，一种是对公众开放的数据，另一种是只有特定用户才能读取的数据。在中心化系统下，数据访问通常具有表I所示的结构：\n\nRSS3有一个完全不同的数据所有权系统。加密身份验证的使用确保只有用户才能控制，同时打破不同应用程序之间的隔阂，如表II所示。\n\n## 4.1给用户带来的改变\n\n这是第一次，用户不必将其存储和写入权限委托给中心化的一方，这通常会导致数据侵权、丢失或泄漏。此外，用户不受任何特定应用程序或平台的约束，因为他们现有的内容和关系可以轻松地携带到他们决定使用的任何新的应用程序中。公共内容现在可以从任何应用程序访问，这允许更多用户访问，从而产生更高的影响力覆盖率。\n\n用户将永远不会因为毫无根据的规定而被禁止。即使某些应用程序（在非常罕见的情况下）确实在本地禁止它们，它们也可以随时获取数据并切换到其他应用程序。审查制度也在很大程度上受到压制，只有一些特定的案例，如父母控制。用户将体验社交媒体和通信应用程序，就像他们现在在以太坊上与DAPP交互一样。他们将只需要一个分布式身份管理器来管理所有的角色，将其用于自己的特定用途，然后使用自己的私钥进行签名。\n\n## 4.2给开发者带来的改变\n\n开发人员现在可以观察、研究和利用一个巨大的公共数据集。在Web2.0时代，平台严格保护自己的数据集，使得外部开发人员无法使用，即使这些数据是最终用户创建的公共内容。使用RSS3，您可以启动“Instagram”，而无需担心如何获得前100万张图片供用户查看：公共UGC已经存在，就像以太坊网络上的交易历史一样。由于除了用户本身之外，没有人可以控制用户数据，因此新的应用程序及其背后的开发人员与现有应用程序相比不再处于严重劣势。如果一个应用程序能够提供更好的用户体验，那么它将被允许更好地为用户服务，而不是因为数据不足而失败。过去为了争夺自己的数据垄断权而相互竞争的应用程序将共同为整个生态系统构建更丰富的数据集。\n\n# 5.应用程序\n\n最初的RSS标准被设计成一种只关注内容的web合成。通过引入RSS3文件之间的链接，可以形成网络。这些链接进一步使RSS3能够授权不同类型的内容和社交网络，包括但不限于：\n\n## 5.1传统媒体网络\n\n传统媒体网络是指仅指定特定节点来创建和发布内容，而其他节点只能选择是否订阅的内容网络类型。这种类型的网络通常具有较高的平均内容质量，因为选择了可以发布的网络。它还可以提高每个内容的覆盖率，覆盖率由受影响的节点数除以节点总数来定义。这些网络中的内容创作者的主要目的通常是从用户那里获得更多的印象，用户通常都在寻找高质量的内容。然而，由于内容和活动节点有限，这些网络的链路密度预计较低，见图3。这些网络将由向特定用户添加特定标签的应用程序创建，这些用户的内容将显示在订阅者的时间表上。这些应用程序可以是集团报纸、传统有线电视和其他面向内容的网络。\n\n## 5.2社交媒体网络\n\n社交媒体网络指的是所有节点都拥有相同的发布和关注权限的网络。在这些网络中，内容创建者只是用户。由于每个人都有相同的发帖权，用户通常有影响力和社交的混合目的。过去十年中大部分成功的社交和内容网络都属于这一类，包括Twitter、Instagram和Tiktok。尽管它不像传统媒体网络那样具有高平均内容覆盖率或高平均内容质量，但更多的节点被激活以创建，从而导致更繁荣的生态系统。如图4所示，预期这两个系统都具有更高的链路密度定向和双向链接。应用程序可以帮助用户创建不同形式的内容，然后根据特定需求提供不同的内容消费体验。\n\n## 5.3通信网络\n\n通信网络是指那些节点可以自由地相互连接，主要目的是社交的网络。这些类型的网络中只存在双向链接，内容主要是为一小部分人（只要不是一个人）创建的。WhatsApp、微信和Facebook Messenger就是这一类的例子。通过利用RSS3文件之间的链接，应用程序可以轻松地与其他开源和对等协议（如WebRTC）一起构建通信网络。图5显示了通信网络的外观。\n\n# 6.模块化\n\n如上所述，RSS3标准和RSS3主机足以构建基本应用程序。然而，作为一个开放的生态系统，RSS3被设计为具有不同的可扩展性模块。就像开发基于RSS3的应用程序一样，开发人员可以在没有任何许可的情况下为系统创建不同的模块。为了支持不同用途的应用程序，我们在此提出一些可能的中间件，这些中间件可以构建在RSS3之上，从而释放出巨大的可能性。\n\n## 6.1付费解锁\n\nRSS3的内容分发系统中可以添加付费解锁模块，这为内容创作者带来了一系列不同的货币化可能性。我们预计付费解锁模块将基于加密学和去中心化托管构建。付费解锁可以按内容使用，用户直接向创建者付费换取解密密钥，也可以与订阅模型一起使用，用户在特定时间段内支付密钥以解锁一系列特殊内容。应用程序还可以利用RSS3文件中的链接和NFT相关资产属性，以实现更好的付费订阅关系。\n\n## 6.2全局索引\n\n当然，在RSS3系统本身中，没有简单的方法可以获得所有已发布项目的全局索引。最好在将来引入去中心化的全局索引服务。通过这种方式，应用程序将能够为用户提供“探索”功能，以便更好地发现新内容和用户关注。此外，这还将使应用程序能够从全局数据集进行筛选。这些过滤器可以是标签、媒体类型、创建者类型或不同属性的组合。有了过滤器，eBay和Zillow等市场应用程序、Reddit和Quora等论坛应用程序以及Pinterest和Dribble等内容应用程序就可以显现。\n\n## 6.3内容标签\n\n为了使系统实现更高的内容分发效率，节点标记内容的透明方式非常有用。与全局索引一起，我们可以期望为最终用户提供更好的搜索和排名体验。我们期望内容标签也由分散的RSS3节点执行，节点可以选择是否要为任务投入额外的计算资源。因此，使用节点放置的标签的应用程序应该为服务付费。为实现相对普遍的采用，可能需要一个内容标签标准。\n\n## 6.4兴趣图谱\n\n最终用户的兴趣图谱对于更好的用户体验也很重要。与中心化式的服务不同，中心化式服务中的用户活动都在中心化服务器中进行跟踪和分析，RSS3生态系统的兴趣图谱应该是一个离线的模块，并且可能具有统一的标准。兴趣图谱只能由开源应用程序使用私钥加密字符串的结果进行更新。因此，用户可以对不同用户体验的任何应用程序感兴趣。此外，应用程序应该让用户完全控制他们是否想要推荐增强的体验，并允许他们随时选择退出。\n\n# 7.风险模型\n\n## 7.1数据篡改\n\n我们的节点有两个可能的篡改点：IPFS存储系统和指针表。\n\n对于具有足够副本的IPFS存储系统，基本上不可能完全删除某些文件。只要指针表得到正确维护，用户数据就不会被篡改。\n\n由于在我们的系统中，公钥用作用户地址，每个RSS3文件（除所有权属性外，有四个基本部分）都附有签名，因此节点可以轻松验证数据和海报是否被伪造，并决定是否同意指针更新。\n\n如果某个节点行为不正常，则只修改其本地存储。连接到它的可信节点会拒绝更新，这样全局分布式指针表就不会被破坏。通过这种方式，节点可以信任他们接收的内容，而不必信任他们从中接收内容的对等方。由于最终用户可以轻松地自己启动一个节点，因此他们没有动机从另一个可疑节点进行查询。此外，将来我们可以有惩罚机制。\n\n## 7.2DDoS\n\n传统DDoS攻击的目标是一个或几个托管web服务的集中式服务器。在RSS3系统中，内容是大规模分布的，并且将有许多节点承载同一内容，因此，将所有节点淹没更加困难。\n\n为了减轻特定内容对专用节点的本地攻击，每个节点可以自由断开任何传入连接或设置带宽限制规则。\n\n## 7.3审查制度\n\nRSS3网络上可能存在两种形式的审查：以用户为目标的审查和以内容为目标的审查。\n\n除非每个节点都同意封锁，否则不可能封锁某个用户。只要存在索引用户RSS3文件的CID的节点，就无法阻止该用户。\n\n内容审查可能基于每个平台或应用程序。然而，只要第三方应用程序协调努力在IPFS或其他地方复制此类内容，原始帖子就不会丢失。\n\n至于对特定帖子的评论，不可能在RSS3系统中审查其帖子的评论。我们建议采用一种系统，将评论记录在评论者的RSS3文件中，只有评论者可以更新自己的内容。\n\n此外，单个RSS3文件不能被任意阻止。随着越来越多的节点加入RSS3网络，并且随着网络的连接和可扩展性越来越强，预计阻止单个RSS3文件将变得越来越困难，因为没有人有能力完全阻止此类文件。审查仍然可以在集中的“代理网关”级别进行，但是，如果启动一个节点既简单又便宜，最终用户就没有动力从这样的网关进行查询。\n\n# 8.结论\n\n一种用于构建“不能作恶”内容和社交网络的协议被提出。我们首先提出了一个新设计的标准，该标准源于最初的RSS标准。通过引入基于密码的身份验证和文件之间的链接，整个系统实现了分散的数据所有权，并可以支持各种类型的网络。与最初的RSS生态系统不同，不同的RSS文件通常存储在子数据中心，将为RSS3构建对等托管服务，因此形成任何数据超级大国的可能性极低。RSS3的灵活性和适应性使其能够支持各种类型的内容和社交网络，无论是现有的还是尚未创建的。\n\n# 9.致谢\n\n我们感谢Dave Winer和RSS-DEV工作组为最初的RSS标准所做的努力，这在很大程度上促进了开放web。我们感谢Suji Yan和ByteDave的大力支持和建议，帮助RSS3成为可能。我们感谢Guo Liu和Yisi Liu关于RSS3标准设计的想法。我们感谢投资者一直以来对我们的支持。我们感谢我们的家人和我们的合作伙伴容忍我们糟糕的睡眠时间（相信我们，我们很快就会从屏幕前离开）。\n\n**最后，谢谢你，中本聪，无论你身在何处。**", "timestamp": 1635083930, "digest": "RM8GsTx6sW-t2aBdFdIJT2wD9xqvvCvwmkDA80Zfbp4",

How does Proof of Work (PoW) crypto affect the environment?\n\nTop answers from [Knox.Market](https://knox.market/):\n\nBitcoin's network used more electricity a day for a single Bitcoin transaction than the amount of electricity used by the average U.S home daily. \n\nBitcoins use more energy than Argentina, if Bitcoin is a country it would be in the top 30 energy users worldwide. \n\nProof of work at scale requires huge amounts of energy, which only increases as more miners join the network. \n\nBitcoin mining devices typically only last for about 1.5 years, miners try to get access to the cheapest and most constant energy sources. \n\nPoS is considered much more energy efficient and the adoption rate of PoS based blockchains far outnumber PoW based blockchains. \n\nConcerns about the energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining, which may cause increased carbon emissions and climate change. \n\nBitcoin and other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies require large amounts of energy, due to the computations needed for mining. \n\n65% of bitcoin miners are located in China, a country that generates most of its energy from coal. \n\nOne of the reasons behind China’s recent crackdown on Bitcoin mining was that Bitcoin miners were illegally reviving idle coal-based power plant over time, the network will consume more computing power and energy to process the same number of transactions. \n\nA more robust and wider approach is needed that makes use of renewable energy sources along with a number of other innovative solutions. \n\nPoW consensus algorithm requires a large amount of electricity to run the network. proof of work” that is incredibly energy hungry. \n\nFee associated with making a transaction is called “gas. two of the most popular consensus algorithms are Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). \n\nProof of work (PoW) is a decentralized consensus mechanism that requires members of a network to expend effort solving an arbitrary mathematical maintain security and decentralization.\n\nEthereum on proof-of-work consumes 73.2 TWh annually, the energy equivalent of a medium-sized country li Proof-of-Stake is presented as an improvement over Proof-of-Work because it does not require hardware or energy consumption. \n\nPoS uses less energy, and for now we can safely say it has a lesser impact on our environment. \n\nProof of work is used widely in cryptocurrency mining, for validating transactions and mining new tokens. \n\nEvery second of the day, the Bitcoin network alone is generating more than 130 quintillion of such guesses, and consuming a whole lot of energy so in order to turn the process into \"work,\" the bitcoin network sets a certain level of \"difficulty.\" \n\nDue to proof of work, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transactions can be processed peer-to-peer in a secure manner.\n\n*The top answers listed above are results from a Knowledge Market with* 8956.95 *CELO liquidity &* 1039.00 *CELO volume.

What is fair launch auction & liquidity bootstrapping pool on CopperLaunch?\n\nTop answers from [Knox.Market](https://knox.market/):\n\nCopper is the most open and user-friendly way to participate in a Fair Launch Auction (FLA), which is a permissionless price discovery mechanism. \n\nFair Launch Auctions (FLAs) are a specific application of Balancer’s Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs). \n\nOn CopperLaunch, the LBP token lists consist of 2 tokens: an ERC20 token aka project launch token & a collateral stablecoins such as USDC, DAI Liquidity bootstrapping pools (LBPs) are also known as configurable rights pools or smart pools. \n\nA smart pool is a contract that controls a Balancer core pool, which contains the tokens and is used on the exchange. \n\nAnyone can buy into or sell out of the auction freely at any time, so price truly regulates itself LBP will continues and price of the project tokens becomes cheaper over time until all tokens are sold and evenly distributed effectively \n\nValue of the tokens that you've received in exchange for contributing to such an auction might go to 0.\n\nLiquidity bootstrapping pool is a great solution for those who want to get tokens into the hands of a user base.\n\nUsing an FLA allows the purchaser to know exactly how many tokens they will get for their money, a benefit compared to batch auction. \n\nThis is ideal for distributing new tokens since the LBP controller only needs to provide the new tokens and a small portion of a second asset Freely launch tokens and participate in auctions. \n\nNo whitelists, hard caps, or listing requirements.\n\nThe collateral tokens can be withdraw at the end of the auction Copper.\n\nBuilt on Balancer Labs LBP, provides users with the opportunity to fairly and transparently participate in token & NFT launches Knoxedge Labs is currently holding their fair launch auction on CopperLaunch with 10M KNX tokens on sale.\n\nA smart pool is less trustless than a shared pool, but does not require the complete trust of a private pool. \n\nChange token launches from being a race where the first bot in or the transaction with the highest gas fee wins.\n\nUnlike an immutable shared pool, smart pool controllers can change the parameters of the pool - but only in controlled ways.\n\nFLA in Copper is a high-risk endeavor, the value of the token you’ve received in exchange might go to 0. \n\nThe high liquidity of an LBP enables distribution of the token to as many participants as possible.\n\nA collateral token that has been deposited along with the launch token. \n\nThe LBP was scheduled to undergo a gradual weight change. \n\nGet the token in the most possible fair way that disincentivizes front-runners and whales getting better rates than smaller participants. \n\nThe weights are initially set heavily in favor of the project token, then gradually “flip” to favor the collateral coin by the end of sale. \n\nUser will contribute to the price discovery on their own DYOR and valuation of the project. \n\nSet the end weights towards which the launch and collateral tokens within the deposited LP will change over the length of the auction.\n\nIn V2 FLA max weights are 99-1 vs 96-4, further maximizing the possible price discovery.\n\n*The top answers listed above are results from a Knowledge Market with* 9389.00 *CELO liquidity &* 1330.00 *CELO volume.

How to bridge KNX from Celo to Avalanche?\n\nTop answers from [Knox.Market](https://knox.market/):\n\nBridge KNX token (ERC-20 token) from Celo to Ethereum Network (ETH) using Optics Bridge. \n\nCurrently KNX does not has a direct bridge from Celo to Avalanche network. \n\nA user only need to connect wallet A in Celo network to send KNX. Then from ETH bridge to AVAX using Avax Bridge as ERC-20 token. \n\nAfter 21 October 2021, KNX can be bought by means of swapping at Ubeswap on celo network.\n\n10,000,000 KNX tokens were bridged from Celo to Ethereum and deposited into CopperLaunch LBP.\n\nAllbridge Is Bridging Cello Dollar To Solana In Collaboration and Launch USDT Bridge From Avalanche To Solana In Collaboration With Saber.\n\nWhile waiting for Optics to be available on Avalanche network, the developers can use Allbridge. \n\nAllbridge is a decentralized, modular, and expanding token bridge with on-chain consensus. \n\nAllBridge to provide 1MIL token with a bridge to Polygon, BSC, and Solana.\n\nA bridge is in practice a mechanism which allows the flow of tokens from one chain to another (and back). \n\nAllbridge is a DAO-style multi-chain hub, connecting DeFi service providers from EVM and non-EVM networks alike recent integrations of Avalanche and Celo chains, can extend their support to the KNX token. \n\nInstant liquidity transfer between multiple different layer-2 networks on Ethereum.\n\nThe developer team can also consider to list KNX on a centralised exchange (CEX) such as Binance, Kucoin or Coinbase. \n\nIt’s a simple, modern, and reliable way to transfer assets between blockchain networks Allbridge core cross-chain liquidity network, Saber helps facilitate the transfer of assets between Solana and other blockchains KNX token can be added in future to allow the transfers of assets in Allbridge.\n\nThis is because Optics only support Celo, Ethereum and Polygon network at this moment. \n\nAllbridge is cheap and simple to use. Most importantly, it supports both Celo and Avalanche network. \n\nanyswap, mutichain, multichain dex, allow bridging between many network, celo seems to be on the development list C-Bridge between Celo to Avax is expected to be ready by end of October.\n\n*The top answers listed above are results from a Knowledge Market with* 1822.10 *AVAX liquidity &* 49.30 *AVAX volume.

{"id": "hqECRvQWZC2HqhtwkR3GDkz1_bXbTwMQAxgIA81FdYM", "title": "NFT Summary Sunday #2 - 24 October 2021", "body": "# NFT Summary Sunday #2 - 24 October\n\nWelcome back to the second edition of Summary Sunday, where we cover the major events that happened in the NFT metaverse since the last edition. This past week has had several major drops and a few little scandals, and for a few days we saw a lot of despair that NFTs were about to enter a bear market before Bitcoin claimed and then lost a new all-time high, leading to rallies across the board.\n\nLet's dive into some of the major events of the past week.\n\n\n---\n\n## Doodles\n\n![The launch went smoothly and the floor price is way up, but allegations of insider dealing have left a bad taste in the mouths of those who were unable to snag a Doodle on mint day.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VEK5NJanJmeEpyTFdMXPt.png?height=1800&width=1800)\n\nThe digital artist known as Burnt Toast dropped his much-anticipated \"Doodles\" 10k collection, minting for 0.123 ETH per item. As of the time of this writing, the floor is 1.35 ETH, meaning minters were able to claim at least a 10x return on investment within a single week! However, this mint was not without its controversies as the whitelist did not seem to be apportioned entirely equitably. Many notable Crypto Twitter influencers found themselves on the whitelists without having to jump through the same hoops that average users had to just to be whitelisted.\n\nThat being said, making a 10x ROI within a week while reaching 12.1k ETH volume is an indicator of a very strong launch and potentially a decent floor long-term. The question is, once the hype dies down will demand hold the floor steady, or will people take aggressive profits in chasing the next big mint? If it's the former, then that could be an indicator that NFT appreciation is still in full-swing, whereas if the floor drops out and the hype moves on, this could instead indicate frothiness in the market meaning that speculation is in full swing - indicating that the NFT market is in the later stages of a bubble.\n\nOf course, the success of one project doesn't make or break an entire market, but if we see massive floor pumps followed by equally massive dumps, that's a strong indication of pump-and-dump mentality of buyers, meaning a lack of long-term confidence may be preventing quality projects from sustaining their price floors.\n\nI'll be keeping my eye on Doodle, particularly because I love the pastel colors and art, and will be attempting to buy one around the 1 ETH mark. If it starts to take off again above 1.5 I may FOMO in just because I want one desperately for a backup PFP, but we'll have to see what the market dictates in the near future.\n\n```\nMint price: 0.123\nCurrent floor: 1.35\nCurrent ROI: 10.97x or 997%\nLong-term outlook: Good to Great (3.5/5)\n```\n\n\n---\n\n## RareBunniClub\n\n![RareBunni is a recently launched, yet-to-be revealed \"cute bunny\" PFP project with strong community support from some very well-known NFT clubs.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qlNZYCinZADUYUMp8JROUDMwK3dGWHboRqoJpAEC37FuZtgT1syJuVXk-iwHV5lssaLh7bY7f6wveIGeAckJMk0KWtTrUZJNuIGVXA=s0)\n\nBefore we dive into RariBunniClub, we should first talk about what a DAO is. Many of you might have seen the term “DAO” before, but you’ve probably seen that term very recently. A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization, or essentially a club whose finances and operations exist on the blockchain, instead of via bank accounts.\n\nMany NFT projects are operating as DAOs, meaning you gain access to the organization by owning one of their NFTs, and one of the most popular NFT DAOs is CyberKongzBets (CKB), a play on the subreddit “WallStreetBets” famous for pumping the Gamestop and AMC stocks during an epic short squeeze earlier in 2021. CKB is a private Discord server for the owners of CyberKongz (see below), a pixelated ape PFP NFT. CKB is well-known in the NFT community for being home to many well-known traders and NFT flippers, and is closely watched by the broader NFT community to see what projects they are purchasing.\n\n![CyberKongz is well-known in the NFT community for having members with deep pockets and an affinity for finding quality PFP projects and \"sweeping the floors\" of upcoming projects in an attempt to make these projects more popular.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WjG6CxWcDQ2nOp0pc27M2.png?height=680&width=680)\n\nEarlier this month we saw the “Kongz,” as they are referred to, sweeping the floor of a few projects, notably [Bitbones](https://www.opensea.io/collectio/thefearface-bitbones) (see my profile picture for an example of a Bitbones). NFT wallet watchers keep track of Kongz’s activities and often try to chase those purchases to get in on the pump. While Kongz is not the only NFT DAO to do so, it is certainly one of the better-known projects.\n\nThis brings us to **RareBunniClub**, the most recent project that Kongz is suspected of coordinating large floor sweeps. Because RareBunni’s are not revealed yet, it is somewhat risky to purchase one pre-reveal, but if the Kongz have it their way this project could see a big pump post-reveal. Just be sure to take profits if you hold more than one, as we don’t know how the art will turn out!\n\n```\nRareBunniClub mint: 0.04 ETH\nPre-reveal floor: 0.09 ETH\nReveal date: Monday, 25 October (late evening, time TBA)\nPost-reveal long-term outlook: Decent to Good (2.5/5)\n```\n\n```\nCyberKongz mint: 0.01 ETH\nCurrent floor: 9.8 ETH\nLong-term outlook: Great to Outstanding (4.5/5)\n```\n\n\n---\n\n## HeadDAO\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6J5nB5XWbtZRTHcf9JdBP.png?height=320&width=320)\n\nSpeaking of NFT DAOs, another big project that launched this past week was [HeadDAO](https://www.opensea.io/collection/headdao), a new NFT project launched by 16 year old [Shamdoo.eth](https://www.twitter.com/TheShamdoo). Shamdoo is clearly a knowledgeable crypto-native even for his age, and has deftly created a sold-out project that quickly raised over 125 ETH to their treasury (coming from commissions of sales) with the purpose of using the community treasury to purchase valuable blue-chip NFT projects for community ownership.\n\nSuch a concept is not new, but for a 16 year old to lead thousands of internet strangers towards the goal of community ownership of quality digital art is pretty impressive. However, there’s a few things to discuss (this is where the scientist in me comes out) regarding some pitfalls of DAO ownership:\n\n* DAOs are *hard* to truly decentralized.

This past week has had several major drops and a few little scandals, and for a few days we saw a lot of despair that NFTs were about to enter a bear market before Bitcoin claimed and then lost a new all-time high, leading to rallies across the board.\n\nLet's dive into some of the major events of the past week.\n\n\n---\n\n## Doodles\n\n![The launch went smoothly and the floor price is way up, but allegations of insider dealing have left a bad taste in the mouths of those who were unable to snag a Doodle on mint day.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VEK5NJanJmeEpyTFdMXPt.png?height=1800&width=1800)\n\nThe digital artist known as Burnt Toast dropped his much-anticipated \"Doodles\" 10k collection, minting for 0.123 ETH per item. As of the time of this writing, the floor is 1.35 ETH, meaning minters were able to claim at least a 10x return on investment within a single week! However, this mint was not without its controversies as the whitelist did not seem to be apportioned entirely equitably. Many notable Crypto Twitter influencers found themselves on the whitelists without having to jump through the same hoops that average users had to just to be whitelisted.\n\nThat being said, making a 10x ROI within a week while reaching 12.1k ETH volume is an indicator of a very strong launch and potentially a decent floor long-term. The question is, once the hype dies down will demand hold the floor steady, or will people take aggressive profits in chasing the next big mint? If it's the former, then that could be an indicator that NFT appreciation is still in full-swing, whereas if the floor drops out and the hype moves on, this could instead indicate frothiness in the market meaning that speculation is in full swing - indicating that the NFT market is in the later stages of a bubble.\n\nOf course, the success of one project doesn't make or break an entire market, but if we see massive floor pumps followed by equally massive dumps, that's a strong indication of pump-and-dump mentality of buyers, meaning a lack of long-term confidence may be preventing quality projects from sustaining their price floors.\n\nI'll be keeping my eye on Doodle, particularly because I love the pastel colors and art, and will be attempting to buy one around the 1 ETH mark. If it starts to take off again above 1.5 I may FOMO in just because I want one desperately for a backup PFP, but we'll have to see what the market dictates in the near future.\n\n```\nMint price: 0.123\nCurrent floor: 1.35\nCurrent ROI: 10.97x or 997%\nLong-term outlook: Good to Great (3.5/5)\n```\n\n\n---\n\n## RareBunniClub\n\n![RareBunni is a recently launched, yet-to-be revealed \"cute bunny\" PFP project with strong community support from some very well-known NFT clubs.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qlNZYCinZADUYUMp8JROUDMwK3dGWHboRqoJpAEC37FuZtgT1syJuVXk-iwHV5lssaLh7bY7f6wveIGeAckJMk0KWtTrUZJNuIGVXA=s0)\n\nBefore we dive into RariBunniClub, we should first talk about what a DAO is. Many of you might have seen the term “DAO” before, but you’ve probably seen that term very recently. A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization, or essentially a club whose finances and operations exist on the blockchain, instead of via bank accounts.\n\nMany NFT projects are operating as DAOs, meaning you gain access to the organization by owning one of their NFTs, and one of the most popular NFT DAOs is CyberKongzBets (CKB), a play on the subreddit “WallStreetBets” famous for pumping the Gamestop and AMC stocks during an epic short squeeze earlier in 2021. CKB is a private Discord server for the owners of CyberKongz (see below), a pixelated ape PFP NFT. CKB is well-known in the NFT community for being home to many well-known traders and NFT flippers, and is closely watched by the broader NFT community to see what projects they are purchasing.\n\n![CyberKongz is well-known in the NFT community for having members with deep pockets and an affinity for finding quality PFP projects and \"sweeping the floors\" of upcoming projects in an attempt to make these projects more popular.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WjG6CxWcDQ2nOp0pc27M2.png?height=680&width=680)\n\nEarlier this month we saw the “Kongz,” as they are referred to, sweeping the floor of a few projects, notably [Bitbones](https://www.opensea.io/collectio/thefearface-bitbones) (see my profile picture for an example of a Bitbones). NFT wallet watchers keep track of Kongz’s activities and often try to chase those purchases to get in on the pump. While Kongz is not the only NFT DAO to do so, it is certainly one of the better-known projects.\n\nThis brings us to **RareBunniClub**, the most recent project that Kongz is suspected of coordinating large floor sweeps. Because RareBunni’s are not revealed yet, it is somewhat risky to purchase one pre-reveal, but if the Kongz have it their way this project could see a big pump post-reveal. Just be sure to take profits if you hold more than one, as we don’t know how the art will turn out!\n\n```\nRareBunniClub mint: 0.04 ETH\nPre-reveal floor: 0.09 ETH\nReveal date: Monday, 25 October (late evening, time TBA)\nPost-reveal outlook: Decent to Good (2.5/5)\n```\n\n```\nCyberKongz mint: 0.01 ETH\nCurrent floor: 9.8 ETH\nFuture outlook: Great to Outstanding (4.5/5)\n```\n\n\n---\n\n## HeadDAO\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6J5nB5XWbtZRTHcf9JdBP.png?height=320&width=320)\n\nSpeaking of NFT DAOs, another big project that launched this past week was [HeadDAO](https://www.opensea.io/collection/headdao), a new NFT project launched by 16 year old [Shamdoo.eth](https://www.twitter.com/TheShamdoo). Shamdoo is clearly a knowledgeable crypto-native even for his age, and has deftly created a sold-out project that quickly raised over 125 ETH to their treasury (coming from commissions of sales) with the purpose of using the community treasury to purchase valuable blue-chip NFT projects for community ownership.\n\nSuch a concept is not new, but for a 16 year old to lead thousands of internet strangers towards the goal of community ownership of quality digital art is pretty impressive. However, there’s a few things to discuss (this is where the scientist in me comes out) regarding some pitfalls of DAO ownership:\n\n* DAOs are *hard* to truly decentralized. If there’s a community treasury fund in control of a single individual (or small group of individuals) this is not a truly decentralized organization.\n* Decentralizing a DAO’s treasury requires some advanced cryptographic and programming knowledge, and DAO operations and politics can quickly scale to a high level of complexity.

Most of the time the answer is no, and while I’m not advocating for reform, it’s important for people to realize that DAO membership doesn’t necessarily guarantee proportional ownership of the DAO’s assets.\n\nNow, for those that don’t know me I’m a grad student researcher at an academic institution for decentralization and blockchain research, therefore I often have some highly skeptical takes on certain concepts, and DAOs are my bread and butter. I’ve been studying them for almost 4 years and they’re still a very nascent technology. However, as the cryptosphere and metaverse continue to grow, DAOs will only become more popular over time.\n\n**Back to the project at hand,** HeadDAO minted for a cheap price of 0.055 ETH and is already at a floor of 0.58, providing a healthy 10x return for investors.

1.背景\n\n原始RSS是第一个被大规模采用的网络聚合器。这是对Web1.0时代“互联网精神”的完美诠释。它是开放、中立的和去中心化的。然而，随着中心化社交媒体平台的兴起，RSS的使用在Web2.0时代急剧下降。\n\n在过去二十年中，内容和链接的控制逐渐被几个中心化的数据超级大国实现，然后这些超级大国滥用其垄断地位进行作恶：\n\n•他们侵犯了我们的隐私——例如，Facebook未经Cambridge Analytica同意就分享数百万用户的个人数据做政治广告。\n\n•他们盗用利润——例如，社交媒体平台的广告收入超过41.5美元，仅2020年一年就有10亿美元。\n\n•他们协助并进行审查——例如，中国主要社交媒体平台禁止主流加密交易所的关键词。\n\n•他们滥用算法-例如，社交媒体应用程序使用算法故意造成用户上瘾。\n\n•他们不鼓励创新——例如，没有开发人员可以创建一个像数据垄断公司那样具有竞争力的应用程序。\n\n让超级大国“不作恶”的努力被证明是徒劳的。似乎需要一个“不能作恶”的体系。\n\n为了创造一个社交和内容网络自由、平等、繁荣的世界，需要一个去中心化的生态系统。作为Web 3.0运动的一部分，它从三个主要原则开始：\n\n•开源：所有源代码都应提供给每个人审查；\n\n•民主治理：生态系统的规则应在民主制度下制定；\n\n•分布式控制：理想情况下，应将控制权分配给每一个参与者，并考虑其贡献；\n\n为了使新的去中心化生态系统达到足够的规模，推翻现有的中心化生态系统，我们还需要：\n\n• 包容性：应支持不同类型的现有和未来可能的应用；\n\n• 中立：底层协议不应偏向特定应用；\n\n• 激励：用户、内容创建者和开发者应该给予转换的实质性激励；\n\n以前的点对点系统中有很多成功的公共内容分发想法，例如BitMessage或ZeroNet引入的广播和订阅功能，重点是站点分发。但是，这些系统，包括最初的RSS标准，不包括允许用户之间进行社交互动的规定。虽然Peergos或Mastodon等其他社交网络系统也支持信息发布，\n\n它们要么专注于私有信息的分发，要么由于架构的多样性而倾向于生成超级节点。\n\nRSS3源于RSS的精华，它是一个协议，它允许用户控制自己的数据，开发人员可以轻松构建去中心化的内容和社交网络。\n\n# 2.RSS3标准\n\n一切都从RSS3标准开始。与最初的RSS标准相比，RSS3更轻便、更简单、更强大、更高效、更可扩展。具体而言，RSS3在以下方面有所不同：\n\n•文件格式从XML更改为JSON，以简化和高效；\n\n•加密密钥被用于验证和认证文件，确保数据完整性和所有权；\n\n•文件通过链接和反向链接连接；\n\n•实现与上游和上下文的内容交互；\n\n•不同的mime类型支持不同形式的内容\n\n•下一个项目和下一个列表用于支持历史记录；\n\nRSS3文件被设计为包含五种基本属性：\n\n•信息属性：文件的基本信息，如id、版本、更新日期等；\n\n•所有权属性：用于加密验证所有权的变量；\n\n•配置文件属性：身份信息-如头像、昵称和兴趣。私有属性是加密的；\n\n•链接属性：与其他RSS3文件的关系。多种类型的关系可以被不同用途的应用程序所定义；\n\n•项目属性：文件所有者发布的所有项目。与原始RSS类似，此处仅存储元数据和指针；\n\n与最初的RSS不同，RSS只提供最新的项目，引入了“项目链”来创建项目文件的链接列表，完全由文件所有者控制。\n\n对于更复杂的用例，应用程序可以在用户同意的情况下添加自定义变量。有关更多详细信息，请访问https://github.com/NaturalSelectionLabs/RSS3.\n\n# 3.托管\n\n## 3.1概述\n\nRSS3托管是一个为RSS3协议服务的点对点系统。一般来说，在这个系统中有三方：节点、用户和第三方应用程序。通常，用户指的是角色背后的真实人物，他们在多个平台上运行节点客户端，包括服务器、笔记本电脑、移动电话甚至嵌入式系统，这些平台都是点对点连接的。核心托管部分最强调的是让用户完全控制和访问他们的数据，应该是一个通用的共享分布式系统。因此，它与应用层解耦，这让用户可以自由切换应用程序，并给开发人员足够的灵活性。开发者可以在分布式节点上自由构建具有友好前端UI的第三方应用程序，这些节点可以是移动应用程序、桌面应用程序、浏览器扩展程序，或其他任何东西。关于中间件和第三方应用程序的进一步讨论见第五节和第六节。\n\n每个托管节点包含三个组件，如图2所示：（1）作为全局文件存储系统的固定内容存储（IPFS），（2）指向RSS3文件或帖子的CID的RSS3指针，以及（3）通信模块，负责将RSS3指针与其他节点同步并处理最终用户查询。\n\n## 3.2固定内容储存\n\n从理论上讲，可以使用本地文件存储系统作为存储基础，但在实践中，它可能会阻碍可扩展性。因此，我们提出了一种系统，其中所有节点都使用固定内容存储系统IPFS，这意味着所有RSS3文件都存储在IPFS上。每个RSS3文件都应该是可读写的，任何角色都有特定的限制。因此，存储系统不应该有基于角色的访问控制，因此IPFS是一个理想的选择。此外，不同于Arweave，IPFS不需要节点与之交互的令牌，这使得最终用户和开发人员能够更灵活、更容易地开始使用它。\n\n## 3.3 RSS3指针\n\n因为我们只能用CID在IPFS上搜索，所以需要一些索引表。默认情况下，每个节点承载从用户地址到用户RSS3文件的CID的映射。由所有节点承载的表构成全局分布的表。\n\n此外，针对不同模块的特定用途，还将提供可选的索引表，第六节将对此进行进一步讨论\n\n将来，可以鼓励节点索引和存储索引值。\n\n## 3.4通信模块\n\n一方面，来自最终用户或第三方应用程序的查询将由通信模块处理。通常，有两种类型的查询：post和subscribe。一旦节点查询订阅RSS3文件，通信模块将首先从分布式RSS3文件表中查找CID，然后从IPFS查询整个RSS3文件，最后还回来。一旦节点查询发布消息，在验证之后，它将更新分布式RSS3文件表。一些高级查询（包括更新索引主题列表或订阅主题）共享类似的工作流。\n\n为了维护分布式表，不同节点之间必须进行通信。表上的每个更新都将被广播，接收更新的节点将进行数据完整性验证。如果比现有版本更新，则节点将更新其本地版本。\n\n从物理上讲，每个节点都可以在远程服务器、个人计算机甚至嵌入式系统上运行。对于公共IP，通信非常简单。对于私有IP，我们使用中继进行NAT遍历。具体来说，对于支持IPv6的用户，可以在IPv6上建立连接。此外，为了最大限度地提高信息流量，还将支持Wi-Fi和蓝牙连接。\n\n## 3.5可扩展性\n\n对于对等系统，必须考虑可伸缩性。对于存储层，IPFS可以保证可扩展性。由于RSS3文件只包含元数据，因此将有足够的磁盘空间用于冗余。与此同时，IPFS社区同样致力于提高可扩展性。因此存储层的可扩展性不应构成挑战。\n\n就RSS3指针而言，由于任何CID都小于64字节，且20字节以太坊兼容地址被用作用户公共地址，因此RSS3文件表的一个条目应小于84字节。假设我们为这个表分配了1GB的空间，我们可以在这个空间中保存1200万个条目。但我们预计RSS3主机将有数十亿\n\n将来可能需要TB甚至更多空间的条目的数量。解决这个问题的一种方法是使用自聚合方法创建子对等组，从BitMessage中学习。\n\n# 4.所有权\n\n随着RSS3的引入，数据所有权得到了重组。用户通常有两种类型的数据，一种是对公众开放的数据，另一种是只有特定用户才能读取的数据。在中心化系统下，数据访问通常具有表I所示的结构：\n\nRSS3有一个完全不同的数据所有权系统。加密身份验证的使用确保只有用户才能控制，同时打破不同应用程序之间的隔阂，如表II所示。\n\n## 4.1给用户带来的改变\n\n这是第一次，用户不必将其存储和写入权限委托给中心化的一方，这通常会导致数据侵权、丢失或泄漏。此外，用户不受任何特定应用程序或平台的约束，因为他们现有的内容和关系可以轻松地携带到他们决定使用的任何新的应用程序中。公共内容现在可以从任何应用程序访问，这允许更多用户访问，从而产生更高的影响力覆盖率。\n\n用户将永远不会因为毫无根据的规定而被禁止。即使某些应用程序（在非常罕见的情况下）确实在本地禁止它们，它们也可以随时获取数据并切换到其他应用程序。审查制度也在很大程度上受到压制，只有一些特定的案例，如父母控制。用户将体验社交媒体和通信应用程序，就像他们现在在以太坊上与DAPP交互一样。他们将只需要一个分布式身份管理器来管理所有的角色，将其用于自己的特定用途，然后使用自己的私钥进行签名。\n\n## 4.2给开发者带来的改变\n\n开发人员现在可以观察、研究和利用一个巨大的公共数据集。在Web2.0时代，平台严格保护自己的数据集，使得外部开发人员无法使用，即使这些数据是最终用户创建的公共内容。使用RSS3，您可以启动“Instagram”，而无需担心如何获得前100万张图片供用户查看：公共UGC已经存在，就像以太坊网络上的交易历史一样。由于除了用户本身之外，没有人可以控制用户数据，因此新的应用程序及其背后的开发人员与现有应用程序相比不再处于严重劣势。如果一个应用程序能够提供更好的用户体验，那么它将被允许更好地为用户服务，而不是因为数据不足而失败。过去为了争夺自己的数据垄断权而相互竞争的应用程序将共同为整个生态系统构建更丰富的数据集。\n\n# 5.应用程序\n\n最初的RSS标准被设计成一种只关注内容的web合成。通过引入RSS3文件之间的链接，可以形成网络。这些链接进一步使RSS3能够授权不同类型的内容和社交网络，包括但不限于：\n\n## 5.1传统媒体网络\n\n传统媒体网络是指仅指定特定节点来创建和发布内容，而其他节点只能选择是否订阅的内容网络类型。这种类型的网络通常具有较高的平均内容质量，因为选择了可以发布的网络。它还可以提高每个内容的覆盖率，覆盖率由受影响的节点数除以节点总数来定义。这些网络中的内容创作者的主要目的通常是从用户那里获得更多的印象，用户通常都在寻找高质量的内容。然而，由于内容和活动节点有限，这些网络的链路密度预计较低，见图3。这些网络将由向特定用户添加特定标签的应用程序创建，这些用户的内容将显示在订阅者的时间表上。这些应用程序可以是集团报纸、传统有线电视和其他面向内容的网络。\n\n## 5.2社交媒体网络\n\n社交媒体网络指的是所有节点都拥有相同的发布和关注权限的网络。在这些网络中，内容创建者只是用户。由于每个人都有相同的发帖权，用户通常有影响力和社交的混合目的。过去十年中大部分成功的社交和内容网络都属于这一类，包括Twitter、Instagram和Tiktok。尽管它不像传统媒体网络那样具有高平均内容覆盖率或高平均内容质量，但更多的节点被激活以创建，从而导致更繁荣的生态系统。如图4所示，预期这两个系统都具有更高的链路密度定向和双向链接。应用程序可以帮助用户创建不同形式的内容，然后根据特定需求提供不同的内容消费体验。\n\n## 5.3通信网络\n\n通信网络是指那些节点可以自由地相互连接，主要目的是社交的网络。这些类型的网络中只存在双向链接，内容主要是为一小部分人（只要不是一个人）创建的。WhatsApp、微信和Facebook Messenger就是这一类的例子。通过利用RSS3文件之间的链接，应用程序可以轻松地与其他开源和对等协议（如WebRTC）一起构建通信网络。图5显示了通信网络的外观。\n\n# 6.模块化\n\n如上所述，RSS3标准和RSS3主机足以构建基本应用程序。然而，作为一个开放的生态系统，RSS3被设计为具有不同的可扩展性模块。就像开发基于RSS3的应用程序一样，开发人员可以在没有任何许可的情况下为系统创建不同的模块。为了支持不同用途的应用程序，我们在此提出一些可能的中间件，这些中间件可以构建在RSS3之上，从而释放出巨大的可能性。\n\n## 6.1付费解锁\n\nRSS3的内容分发系统中可以添加付费解锁模块，这为内容创作者带来了一系列不同的货币化可能性。我们预计付费解锁模块将基于加密学和去中心化托管构建。付费解锁可以按内容使用，用户直接向创建者付费换取解密密钥，也可以与订阅模型一起使用，用户在特定时间段内支付密钥以解锁一系列特殊内容。应用程序还可以利用RSS3文件中的链接和NFT相关资产属性，以实现更好的付费订阅关系。\n\n## 6.2全局索引\n\n当然，在RSS3系统本身中，没有简单的方法可以获得所有已发布项目的全局索引。最好在将来引入去中心化的全局索引服务。通过这种方式，应用程序将能够为用户提供“探索”功能，以便更好地发现新内容和用户关注。此外，这还将使应用程序能够从全局数据集进行筛选。这些过滤器可以是标签、媒体类型、创建者类型或不同属性的组合。有了过滤器，eBay和Zillow等市场应用程序、Reddit和Quora等论坛应用程序以及Pinterest和Dribble等内容应用程序就可以显现。\n\n## 6.3内容标签\n\n为了使系统实现更高的内容分发效率，节点标记内容的透明方式非常有用。与全局索引一起，我们可以期望为最终用户提供更好的搜索和排名体验。我们期望内容标签也由分散的RSS3节点执行，节点可以选择是否要为任务投入额外的计算资源。因此，使用节点放置的标签的应用程序应该为服务付费。为实现相对普遍的采用，可能需要一个内容标签标准。\n\n## 6.4兴趣图谱\n\n最终用户的兴趣图谱对于更好的用户体验也很重要。与中心化式的服务不同，中心化式服务中的用户活动都在中心化服务器中进行跟踪和分析，RSS3生态系统的兴趣图谱应该是一个离线的模块，并且可能具有统一的标准。兴趣图谱只能由开源应用程序使用私钥加密字符串的结果进行更新。因此，用户可以对不同用户体验的任何应用程序感兴趣。此外，应用程序应该让用户完全控制他们是否想要推荐增强的体验，并允许他们随时选择退出。\n\n# 7.风险模型\n\n## 7.1数据篡改\n\n我们的节点有两个可能的篡改点：IPFS存储系统和指针表。\n\n对于具有足够副本的IPFS存储系统，基本上不可能完全删除某些文件。只要指针表得到正确维护，用户数据就不会被篡改。\n\n由于在我们的系统中，公钥用作用户地址，每个RSS3文件（除所有权属性外，有四个基本部分）都附有签名，因此节点可以轻松验证数据和海报是否被伪造，并决定是否同意指针更新。\n\n如果某个节点行为不正常，则只修改其本地存储。连接到它的可信节点会拒绝更新，这样全局分布式指针表就不会被破坏。通过这种方式，节点可以信任他们接收的内容，而不必信任他们从中接收内容的对等方。由于最终用户可以轻松地自己启动一个节点，因此他们没有动机从另一个可疑节点进行查询。此外，将来我们可以有惩罚机制。\n\n## 7.2DDoS\n\n传统DDoS攻击的目标是一个或几个托管web服务的集中式服务器。在RSS3系统中，内容是大规模分布的，并且将有许多节点承载同一内容，因此，将所有节点淹没更加困难。\n\n为了减轻特定内容对专用节点的本地攻击，每个节点可以自由断开任何传入连接或设置带宽限制规则。\n\n## 7.3审查制度\n\nRSS3网络上可能存在两种形式的审查：以用户为目标的审查和以内容为目标的审查。\n\n除非每个节点都同意封锁，否则不可能封锁某个用户。只要存在索引用户RSS3文件的CID的节点，就无法阻止该用户。\n\n内容审查可能基于每个平台或应用程序。然而，只要第三方应用程序协调努力在IPFS或其他地方复制此类内容，原始帖子就不会丢失。\n\n至于对特定帖子的评论，不可能在RSS3系统中审查其帖子的评论。我们建议采用一种系统，将评论记录在评论者的RSS3文件中，只有评论者可以更新自己的内容。\n\n此外，单个RSS3文件不能被任意阻止。随着越来越多的节点加入RSS3网络，并且随着网络的连接和可扩展性越来越强，预计阻止单个RSS3文件将变得越来越困难，因为没有人有能力完全阻止此类文件。审查仍然可以在集中的“代理网关”级别进行，但是，如果启动一个节点既简单又便宜，最终用户就没有动力从这样的网关进行查询。\n\n# 8.结论\n\n一种用于构建“不能作恶”内容和社交网络的协议被提出。我们首先提出了一个新设计的标准，该标准源于最初的RSS标准。通过引入基于密码的身份验证和文件之间的链接，整个系统实现了分散的数据所有权，并可以支持各种类型的网络。与最初的RSS生态系统不同，不同的RSS文件通常存储在子数据中心，将为RSS3构建对等托管服务，因此形成任何数据超级大国的可能性极低。RSS3的灵活性和适应性使其能够支持各种类型的内容和社交网络，无论是现有的还是尚未创建的。\n\n# 9.致谢\n\n我们感谢Dave Winer和RSS-DEV工作组为最初的RSS标准所做的努力，这在很大程度上促进了开放web。我们感谢Suji Yan和ByteDave的大力支持和建议，帮助RSS3成为可能。我们感谢Guo Liu和Yisi Liu关于RSS3标准设计的想法。我们感谢投资者一直以来对我们的支持。我们感谢我们的家人和合作伙伴容忍我们糟糕的睡眠时间（相信我们，我们很快就会从屏幕前离开）。\n\n**最后，谢谢你，中本聪，无论你身在何处。**", "timestamp": 1635084129, "digest": "RM8GsTx6sW-t2aBdFdIJT2wD9xqvvCvwmkDA80Zfbp4",

How would you feel? ‘I can’t travel abroad anymore, I can’t buy a car.’”\n\nBibler recalls the head of the central bank warning: “If we don’t get on top of this, we’re looking at 30 years of anarchy in this country. And I think he was right, I think we were a week away from a kind of a Mad Max,” he says.\n\n> “In the kind of crash that we had with supermarket shelves going bare, and you’re not sure where your next meal is going to come from, and you’re not sure if the money in your wallet can buy anything the next morning, I think you’re pretty close to a real breakdown in society.”\n\nOver the months that followed, inflation hit 14% annually, interest rates hit 15% while GDP fell 10% in real terms and plunged the country into a depression. The unemployment rate quintupled. Ranked as the world’s most peaceful nation by the Global Peace Index, things turned ugly.\n\n“The mood on the streets of Iceland was vengeful and kind of scary,” he says. “I was a bit afraid of it. People were down in front of the Parliament every day screaming and yelling and banging pots and pans, lighting fires and making noise — really super angry.”\n\nBut, how did the three major banks in this tiny nation manage to grow their assets to 11 times the size of the economy, to the point where their collapse sent the country to the brink of anarchy? As Bibler details in his new book Iceland’s Secret: The Untold Story of the World’s Biggest Con, it was a mixture of greed, incompetence and outright fraud.\n\n![Reykjavík](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pexels-flor-asef-5180020.jpg)\n\nReykjavík is home to 120,000 people and is the capital of Iceland (Pexels)\n\n#### The most peaceful country\n\nIceland is a very unusual place. Despite having just 350,000 people, it has everything a larger nation has including its own government, customs service, share market and industry. For years, the economy was built around fishing and aluminum smelting, but after the banking sector was deregulated in 2001, huge amounts of foreign money poured in. The banks went on a debt-fueled spending spree acquiring foreign real estate, fashion brands and soccer teams.\n\n“Suddenly, there was a huge market for Icelandic (debt), especially commercial debt, which was high yielding,” Bibler explains. \\\n\n\n> “And these newly privatized banks, they were hungry to grow, they were super aggressive. So they grew almost like a pumpkin, overnight.”\n\nThe banks grew 20-fold in the space of just seven years and by the second quarter of 2008, the national debt had grown to 50 billion euro, equating to 160,000 euro worth of debt for every man, woman and child.\n\nWith the economy booming and the stock market jumping up to 4% a month, no one paid much mind to warning shots fired in ominous 2006 reports from the IMF and Merrill Lynch.\n\n“It had been the poorest country in Europe for like 1000 years,” he says. “And I think people were like now we’ve made it, it’s okay while the sun shines.”\n\n#### A most peculiar bank\n\n![](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jared-Bibler-1-200x300.jpg)\n\nJared Bibler hard at work. (Supplied)\n\nWhile he’d been drawn to the laid-back attitude and values, he was horrified by the incompetence and laissez-faire attitude of his coworkers and Landsbanki.\n\nThe whole place ran on manual data entry and few understood even basic concepts like T+3 settlements (settling a securities trade within three days).\n\n“Internally, my view was it was kind of a complete chaos,” he says. Bibler was asked to look after a 200 million euro hedge fund, even though the bank didn’t have any way to track the amount of cash the fund held on any given day. “The only way we could do that is to create an Excel spreadsheet, and then go and look up in five or six places and copy-paste these numbers,” he explains.\n\nIn another incident, he recalls the sales guys using find and replace to change all the references from Icelandic Krona to Euros in a fund brochure to attract German investors, despite the fact the only reason it made high returns was because it used Krona. \n\n> “It was just the Wild West.”\n\nThe last straw was when he was instructed by his manager to wire 5 million euro to an unknown bank account with no documentation on three separate occasions.\n\n“As soon as I did it, within a few days, they asked to send another five and then another five. So altogether, we sent 15 (million euro) with no documentation to some random account in Norway.”\n\nWhen he heard second hand that his manager’s boss had started asking questions about the unusual transfers and that his manager had blamed him, Bibler decided to quit.\n\n“My last day was Friday, October 3, and my bank collapsed the next Tuesday, the seventh.”\n\n> 3 October 2008 /6\n>\n> IMF calls Iceland: we want to send a team there next week.\n>\n> Meanwhile Kaupþing transfers ISK 10B ($88m) offshore to Marple.\n>\n> And I work my final day at Landsbanki — the day of the cakes.\n>\n> — Jared Bibler (@jared_bibler) [October 3, 2021](https://twitter.com/jared_bibler/status/1444583676717801472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n#### The crisis unfolds\n\nIn mid-September 2008, the financial world was shocked by rapidly spreading contagion in financial markets. On Sept. 15, Lehman Brothers — the fourth-largest Wall Street bank — collapsed along with old school stockbroker Merrill Lynch. The next day, U.S. insurance giant AIG went under, the following day the largest U.S. mortgage lender HBOS fell.\n\nIceland’s banks toppled like dominos: Glitner on Oct. 6, Landsbanki on Oct. 7 and Kaupping on Oct. 9. In a single week, 90 percent of the financial sector defaulted, and, unsurprisingly, there was a run on the banks with 20 times the normal amounts withdrawn. With the krona dropping like a stone, Bibler made an emergency trip to France to get as many euros from ATMs in cash as possible.\n\nQuitting his job days before the collapse meant he wasn’t eligible for social security payments and his savings were tied up in a high-interest fund that was frozen. It took six months to regain access to the money.\n\n> “So we just didn’t even have access to the cash that we thought we had even in the local currency. So I only had maybe, in my regular bank account, maybe like 1000 bucks worth of local currency. So that was super scary.”\n\nIn Iceland, the principle in a mortgage is adjusted upward with inflation, which saw the 20% equity he’s built up in his home with partner Hulda becoming worth less than nothing.\n\n“Suddenly, that 80% loan value was now 110% or 120%,” he says, adding that they were forced to find someone willing to take over the house and mortgage for nothing. “We just gave them both. We handed them the keys, the house, the mortgage — they took the whole thing.”\n\nIn the book, Bibler describes being so poor they resorted to eating bjugur – horse-meat sausages boiled in water.\n\n“Once done, I tried to smile at her across the dinner table but the smell, the taste and especially the texture of the giant white gobs of horse fat that popped out of the sliced casing were too much. For me, this is the sign that we have hit the bottom of the barrel.”\n\n![Iceland (Source: Pexels)](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pexels-benjamin-suter-3617500.jpg)\n\nIceland offers amazing views of the Northern Lights and runs on almost 100% geothermal and hydro power. (Source: Pexels)\n\n#### The investigation\n\nAfter six months of unemployment, he found a job on a team of 16 at financial supervisory authority FME, investigating the collapse. He spent the next two years following a trail of excel spreadsheets to piece together what had happened. Along with his time at the Office of the Special Prosecutor in Reykjavík, he and his team investigated 30 criminal cases.\\\n\\\nIt soon became clear that the banks had been engaged in massive market fraud for a decade or so. All three were buying their own shares on the stock market to prop up the price. On many days, they were the largest buyer in the market. Kaupping, the largest bank, bought $1.25 billion worth of its own shares in the year before it collapsed. Its market cap was only $5B.\n\n“I was shocked. I didn’t believe it. I didn’t want to believe it,” he says.\n\n> “When I just saw these guys going in every day, buying up like literally sometimes 100% of the daily trading volume… and then going back years and seeing that behavior, this kind of shook my worldview quite a bit.”\n\nTo hide the enormous piles of shares, the banks created fake shell companies which they then lent even more money to, to purchase the shares.\n\n“It was a brilliant scam really, as long as they continued to borrow money from abroad and grow, they could continue to buy their own shares to keep the price set really wherever they liked.”\n\n![Iceland's Secret](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iceland.jpg)The collapse became a major international incident due to the large amounts of foreign investment in Iceland. Around 300,000 people in the United Kingdom were affected, with U.K. local councils alone tipping in 840 million pounds. The U.K. government applied terrorism provisions to recoup billions.\n\nSadly, but predictably, given how small Iceland is and how well connected the architects of the schemes were, there wasn’t much appetite to bring the culprits to justice. By 2011, Bibler’s staff had been cut to just three people. The Icelandic general counsel told him:\n\n“We don’t need you or this kind of team anymore. Don’t be naïve, the financial crime that happened here, that was all back in 2008. It won’t ever happen again.”\n\nBibler quit.\n\n#### Justice denied\n\nHe’d naively expected the traders responsible would face long jail periods as he assumed the maximum six-year penalty would apply for each incident.\n\n> “I’m like these poor guys were doing this market abuse like 50 trades a day, 220 trading days a year and five years, I was thinking multiply each one of those by six years and they’re gonna be in prison for 1000 years or something.”\n\nHe was astonished to find prosecutors that thousands of incidents would be covered by a single charge — with a maximum penalty of a handful of years for the lot.\n\n![](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jared-Bibler-2.jpg)\n\nBibler believes the punishments handed out were not enough to act as a deterrent. (Supplied)\n\nThe Kaupping prosecution was typical of the trials. Nine executives were charged with market abuse and the evidence clearly showed they were guilty of buying up 42% of all volume in its own shares in Iceland between 2007 and 2008 and 31% of the volume in Sweden.\n\nDespite the scale of the crimes, and the fact 30,000 bank investors were wiped out, just seven of the nine were convicted in 2015 in the Reykjavik District Court and received sentences ranging between zero jail and four and a half years.\n\nAll told 29 men and two women — CEOs and execs from the three big banks and related institutions — were [sentenced](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/iceland-seeks-closure-on-financial-crash-with-last-prosecution-of-banker/) to a combined total of 99 years in prison. That works out to an average of 3.2 years each person for crimes ranging from insider trading to market manipulation.\n\nMost were released within a year after serving time in Iceland’s spectacular white collar prison at Kviabryggja. Bibler writes:\n\n“Through changes in the law, already short sentences became comically short — and within mere months, they were back to flying helicopters and dining out with their spouses at the best restaurants in Reykjavik.” \n\nIceland’s Prime Minister was also found guilty of negligence by a special court, but was spared prison. He later became Iceland’s ambassador to the United States.\\\n\\\nBibler doesn’t believe the punishments fit the crimes.\n\n“I don’t get excited about putting people in jail. You know, I’m not into punishing people. But at the same time, the message that that sends is horrible.”\n\n![](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Bibler-mag-small.jpg)\n\nJared Bibler has written a book about the fallout from the GFC on Iceland.\n\n#### Bitcoin emerges\n\nBitcoin emerged not long after the collapse of Iceland’s banking industry, and cryptocurrency mining became a sizable industry thanks to dirt cheap rent and 100% renewable energy from geothermal and hydroelectricity. By some accounts, 8% of all Bitcoin has been mined in Iceland.\n\nBibler thinks it’s too early to tell if the radical transparency of blockchains can help mitigate against corruption.\n\n> “I think crypto is really in its infancy. I don’t know what it’s going to lead to. But I think there’s a lot of fascinating ideas and developments that will come out that I think we can’t predict. We’re in the era like when Netscape went public in 1994.”\n\n“I think there’s something there, but I’m not sure what it is yet,” he adds.\n\nBut he is sure [another collapse is coming](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2021/09/03/how-to-prepare-for-end-of-bull-run-part-1-timing). He concludes the book with a warning that Iceland’s financial collapse  was the result of turning a blind eye to corruption to keep the financial machine pumping out money. He concludes the book by writing:\n\n*“Despite the devastating events of 2008 the dragon of deeply corrupt financial markets has still not been slain… Iceland in 2004-08 is a preview of coming attractions for the world’s big markets. Today we find ourselves back in the equivalent of the 1930s thinking the Great War is over and done with… We naively refer to 2008 as the Global Financial Crisis as if there will only ever be one, when GFC II almost certainly looms on the horizon. We are sitting on a time bomb.”*\n\nJust before we finish up the interview, we share a joke that the looming financial collapse might see us both eating horse meat sausages again.\n\n“Oh Jesus, I hope not,” he laughs. “One time in my life was enough.”\n\n***[ICELAND’S SECRET](https://icelandssecret.com/):  The Untold Story Of the World’s Biggest Con is out October 5.***\n", "timestamp": 1635085552, "digest": "j9-3ImPbzKScDw3Q6c07RtM7oSX8rfnc2VecXozdCSo", "contributor": "0xcba79f3406b19FE16cAd21Bb96865421837D23b5"}

Just as he dreams of a world without the environmental damage caused by irresponsible litterers, he imagines a future where Bitcoin cleans up many of the ills of the financial system.\\\n\\\nHoping to soon see a Bitcoin-friendly bank in town, Stewart sees Bitcoin as an avenue that can lift the town’s fortunes by way of increased wealth and business opportunities like mining facilities, and even Bitcoin events.\n\n> “A lot of it is about fixing the wrongs of the past financial system. In the past, we didn’t have access to this amazing technology that we have today when it comes to our financial system and storing our value.”\n\n#### Bitcoin\n\nStewart’s plan to dole out Bitcoin to the people of Cool Valley is already fully funded. He explains the plan is being paid for by private donors, with the aim of spreading adoption and educating users. “As of right now, the project is fully funded for $1,000 per household,” he confirmed, adding that the town has received further donations because “the story got so popular in a way that I never anticipated.” \n\n> A day in my life through the eyes of [@JaelinCollier](https://twitter.com/JaelinCollier?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/N1mAerlvT7](https://t.co/N1mAerlvT7)\n>\n> — Mayor Jayson Stewart (@coolvalleymayor) [September 22, 2021](https://twitter.com/coolvalleymayor/status/1440760483468902403?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThough Stewart believes it would be “very wise for a town to hold parts of its treasury in cryptocurrencies,” he explains that “there are legal obstacles to doing that, many of which are laid out in the state constitution in regards to towns and cities investing in assets.” He makes it clear that he is first and foremost interested in seeing regular people, rather than government entities, benefit from Bitcoin. The more people that hold a stake in the Bitcoin network, the more powerful it can become.\n\n> “What really excites me, and what I’m working on, is getting regular people to hold Bitcoin, and for them to really benefit from the appreciation of holding an asset like that.”\n\nStewart has encountered a mixed set of reactions from the town’s residents, from excitement and curiosity to confusion, with the latter being common among older members of the community. “They have a lot of questions about ‘what is it?,’ ‘how do I store it?,’ ‘how do I get access to it?’” he lists.\n\nThe distribution procedure is not yet finalized, but education is among the project’s key goals because, in order to get their BTC, residents need to understand what it is they are receiving. For this, there are plans to organize workshops or similar learning opportunities. “We’re going to get people storing their own Bitcoin as quickly as possible,” the mayor declares.\n\n> Missouri Mayor,[@coolvalleymayor](https://twitter.com/coolvalleymayor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), “Into bitcoin since 2015.

Patience is a virtue, after all. In order to encourage this patience, there are plans to offer residents an option of a larger payout if they agree to hold their coins for a set amount of time, with a smaller amount given to those who want to sell. \n\n> “We really just want them to be able to understand the asset and become self sovereign with their storage understanding how to hold their own keys”\n\nIn addition to learning about Bitcoin, Stewart’s initiative is likely to inspire other indirect benefits to the community. For one, it is likely to introduce many residents to investing in general, which may bring many benefits in the future. Computer literacy is another area that is likely to see improvement on account of the Bitcoin incentive, and the new users are likely to begin learning about other cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications as well. As such, it is likely that the move will ultimately inspire some residents to seek careers in the blockchain industry.\n\n#### Cleaning others’ messes\n\nIn his early 30’s, Stewart first interacted with Bitcoin in 2015 while working as an assistant for Magic, a San Francisco based company that often saw “very, very wealthy clients” send Bitcoin to the company’s wallets, which Stewart would then convert into fiat in order to purchase various goods. Though he did not have much in-depth understanding of the cryptocurrency, “I thought it was cool internet money,” he recalls.\n\nWhen he was a child, Stewart dreamed of being a nature photographer and owning a wildlife sanctuary. That’s why later in 2015, he left his job at Magic to pursue a lifelong passion for environmental restoration and wildlife rehabilitation through his new company, PL28, which he operated from Cool Valley. PL28’s mission was to clean up the oceans, a calling that was “the focus of my life” for the next several years until Stewart ran for mayor in 2019.\n\n> “Right up until I decided to run, I was just pulling plastic from oceans, rivers and different waterways — to try to make the wildlife habitat for marine life a little bit better.”\n\nThrough PL28, Stewart has helped with ocean cleanup in places including the Philippines, Haiti, the Bahamas, Los Angeles and Singapore. He explains that the cleanup process is different according to the type of ecosystem at hand. “Out at sea, you’re usually going to get mostly abandoned fishing nets” which continuously trap and kill wildlife, whereas in a river environment like that of St. Louis, “you collect a lot of plastic bottles like milk jugs,” he says. \n\n![](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1545063447044.jpg)\n\nA map showing water clean-up efforts he organized around the world. source: LinkedIn\n\nThough he loves to spend time with marine wildlife, he regrets that the work of ocean cleanup was “a lot more logistics” such as coordinating volunteers, as opposed to direct work in the field on his part. All told, Stewart “worked with people in 47 different countries to pick plastic from the ocean,” with that plastic usually processed into usable plastic and made into premium goods made of the reclaimed material.\n\nToday, Stewart has moved on from active ocean cleanup, but his adventurous spirit of cleaning up the messes and mistakes of the past continues to drive him.\n\n#### Small town mayor\n\nAfter high school, Stewart studied psychology at the University of Miami from 2008 to 2012. During his studies in 2011, he founded a record production company Pink Fader with his freshman-year roommate. The duo saw some apparent success because an act under their label “ended up getting Grammy-nominated, which is cool, and we had a couple of songs go into the top 50 on the charts,” Stewart recalls with a hint of pride.\n\nFor Stewart, who moved around a lot first with his family and later due to his entrepreneurship activities, Cool Valley “has been the most consistent place” through various parts of his life. Young and armed with fresh ideas, he decided to run for mayor in hopes of improving the services and revitalizing a suffering business district. \n\n> “I was going to create more of a haven where humans and wildlife could live and interact together, safely, for both parties.”\n\nBeing mayor is a great honor, because “this little town that I grew up in wants me to be their representative and to be their leader.” He describes the job as having a particularly broad scope of responsibility far beyond his previous work, feeling a strong sense of responsibility for the well-being of the townspeople. He even has the ability to grant pardons for certain offenses, which he announced for “every person convicted of nonviolent offenses involving cannabis and/or psilocybin mushrooms” last year in a move that [earned](https://www.crossingpathspac.com/post/we-commend-mayor-jayson-stewart-of-cool-valley-mo-for-his-leadership-on-psilocybin-reform) him commendations for “groundbreaking work to fix the harms of the War on Drugs.”\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum from big picture ideals, “there are always little things that we would talk about as well, like a pothole on the street or whatever,” he says of the things that keep him busy.\n\n#### Bitcoin valley\n\nThough there is not yet a petition to rename the town, it is quite conceivable that the Bitcoin effect will touch Cool Valley in concrete ways. While the town already has a Bitcoin ATM, there are many more opportunities to consider. “We’ve had some people reach out about opening a mining facility,” Stewart beams, adding that “I’m trying to get a Bitcoin-friendly bank over here.”\n\nAs luck would have it, Stewart has just joined the Advisory Board for the Midwest BankCenter, which is a locally owned bank with nearly $2 billion in assets. “They’ve been meeting for 100 years, but I just had my first board meeting with them like three days ago,” he laughs. Asked if they knew him as the ‘Bitcoin guy,’ Stewart proudly stated that “they do now!”\n\nFrom his perspective, Stewart senses “a cautious sort of optimism” in the local banking sector. While it’s clear that they want to avoid risks, “they also enjoy the potential opportunity for big upsides in their investments.”\n\nConsidering the number of donors, it looks like there will be money left over after the distributions to residents. With these funds, one idea Stewart is exploring is solar lighting and other energy efficiency initiatives in Cool Valley. “There’s a lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt when it comes to the environmental effects of Bitcoin,” he admits, adding that he wants to set a positive example of the good that Bitcoin can bring.\n\nWith the University of Missouri-St. Louis campus bordering Cool Valley to the South, the town might be a great place to host a Bitcoin conference, or even a technology hub of sorts one day. Mayor Stewart agrees, saying “I think that could be a pretty nice outcome — that’d be super cool.”\n", "timestamp": 1635086034, "digest": "9sGdb4OySJILYDzeUit004sjIAZxNcmnmNWhenaavl4", "contributor": "0x8EB2e0F104A8B403e0f7AAa413544C1b87c84003"}

Neste projeto foram convocados binómios aos quais foi dado um destaque particular a uma das faces (imagens irresolutas, dissolução do real, verdades objetivas), deixando o seu reverso obscurecido. O objetivo foi não apenas analisar o conceito ao qual foi dado destaque, mas manifestar igualmente uma presença, através da sua ausência. Pensarmos a ideia de imagens irresolutas implica pensar o que é que pode constituir, ou não, uma imagem resoluta, ou se a própria noção de imagens resolvidas, terminadas, solucionadas, faz sequer sentido. Da mesma forma, proferir ou interagir com a ideia de verdade objetiva é o primeiro passo para perceber o quão irreconciliável a ideia de verdade e objetividade realmente são. No reverso desta ideia estará a ideia de verdade subjetiva, mas também a de verdade absoluta. Todas elas distintas, mas todas elas complementares. Por isto mesmo, fará mais sentido pensar em cada um destes conceitos, não tanto como duas faces de uma moeda, mas enquanto poliedros.\n\n            Ao longo deste texto serão destacadas determinadas faces de determinados poliedros, sejam eles regulares ou irregulares. Determinadas ideias, determinados conceitos, que irão, por sua vez, estar relacionadas com outras faces, que podem ou não estar aqui explícitas. Este texto irá considerar, em particular, o que é que constitui ou pode constituir uma dissolução da palavra, uma multiplicação semântica e uma regulamentação do real em 2021. Será a partir destas que nos vamos procurar debruçar de forma mais alargada no processo de atualização das atuais práticas discursivas, nas práticas de produção de conhecimento e nas práticas de contextualização.\n\n            Em todas as suas vertentes, o Ciclo procurou promover posições autónomas e ativas, que se distanciassem de um consumo passivo de informação. O foco esteve sempre no desenvolvimento de pensamento crítico, idealmente em coletivo. Este texto procura espelhar isso mesmo.\n\n \n\n## Sobre a Dissolução da Palavra\n\n \n\n            No contexto do Ciclo foi introduzida a noção de dissolução. Das imagens e, em particular, das palavras, a partir da qual surgiu a equação: *dissolução da palavra = multiplicação semântica*. Para esta primeira secção as práticas discursivas que são viabilizadas e o modo como a palavra é empregue dentro do domínio digital são aspetos significativos. De forma a justificar a referência a esta equação, é importante contextualizarmos o nosso ponto de partida.\n\n            Como tem sido várias vezes referido, a internet surgiu de forma a responder às necessidades do departamento de defesa dos Estados Unidos, em particular das suas necessidades militares. Depois de ser introduzida no espaço universitário, na sua fase de maturação, próximo do ano 2000, o espaço digital da internet começa a contribuir para um importante processo de produção e sistematização de informação, inicialmente segundo critérios democráticos. Mas o que começa por ser democrático, rapidamente deixa de o ser. A esperança atribuída ao espaço digital depressa se transforma numa crise, que se torna indiscutivelmente clara na segunda metade dos 2010s, na qual se instaura o regime de pós-verdade.\n\n            Enquanto um *regime* específico de verdade, uma perspetiva de Anna Lorusso (2020) à qual subscrevemos, o regime do pós-verdade caracteriza-se não apenas por ter sido originado por *media* digitais, mas por ser *sustentado* e *mantido* por estes mesmos *media* digitais. É aqui que se passam a cruzar a esfera digital e a esfera material, espaço no qual são estipulados sistemas de poder e de verdade específicos (Lorusso, 2021: 1006). Por isto mesmo, para além da definição de um conjunto de práticas discursivas e de linguagens próprias, encontram-se já aqui implícitas, em particular, as linguagens e discursos que são viabilizados e aos quais são dados visibilidade dentro e fora do domínio digital. Ainda que este regime seja mais que isso, para este contexto fará sentido caracterizá-lo segundo três pontos fundamentais: os seus sistemas de poder, os seus sistemas de verdade e as suas práticas discursivas. Poder, verdade e linguagem.\n\n            A concentração e centralização dos poderes exercidos, em simultâneo com a viabilização de um conjunto que práticas discursivas específicas que serão identificadas mais à frente, levaram-nos à financeirização do espaço digital. Esta financeirização – e aqui teremos de simplificar um longo processo – significou que os mecanismos de transmissão de informação passaram a privilegiar a quantidade do consumo e não a qualidade do consumo, aspeto que é indissociável e resultante do presente modelo económico. Esta decisão teve evidentemente impacto na forma como a palavra passou a ser empregue e utilizada. Ao passarem a estar dependentes do lucro gerado pela informação transmitida, os mecanismos de transmissão de informação procuraram maximizar a quantidade do consumo dos seus produtos. Mecanismos de transmissão de informação são aqui sinónimo de jornais, websites e meios de comunicação estruturalmente semelhantes, o que significa que os produtos comercializados são dados, informação e, menos frequentemente, conhecimento. Esta atualização marca um momento de charneira importante.\n\n            Este processo de comercialização ou mercantilização da informação (Wark, 2019) passou a privilegiar práticas generalizadas de descontextualização de informação. Neste contexto os novos protagonistas passaram a ser os excertos e os segmentos informativos que permitiram uma relação superficial com a informação fragmentada que privilegiavam os dados e não tanto a informação, ou menos ainda conhecimento. A quantidade de consumo passou a ser otimizada quando permitia confirmar crenças individuais ou quando colocava, violentamente, essas crenças em dúvida. Ou, posto de outro modo, quando esta informação nos dizia o que queremos ouvir, ou quando nos destabilizava. Em ambos os casos, este consumo era potenciado quando existia uma manipulação ou descontextualização ativa, que enquadrasse esta informação numa das duas categorias anteriores. Foram em grande parte ações de fragmentação, reconfiguração e reapropriação de informação, que contribuíram para uma degeneração da informação (e não tanto uma “desinformação”), que permitiram práticas de descontextualização, que os mecanismos de transmissão de informação conseguiram atingir um maior consumo e, consequentemente, um maior lucro.\n\n            O modo quantitativo como consumimos informação hoje é em grande parte resultado da financeirização do espaço digital. Da mesma forma, o desgaste da palavra é resultante do modo quantitativo como consumimos informação. Palavras são também elas redutos, de intenções e significados. Construções, portanto, que também podem ser alvo de desgaste. A descontextualização contínua da palavra e a sua aplicação excessiva contribuem para uma erosão que reduz a sua capacidade comunicativa. E o que é uma palavra que perdeu a sua capacidade comunicativa senão um artefacto desvirtuado?\n\n            É através desta erosão que chegamos à ideia de dissolução da palavra. A utilização volátil de determinadas palavras, no espaço digital e a partir do espaço digital, reduz o campo linguístico de quem as utiliza, justamente porque esta utilização volátil, ao substituir um conjunto específico e contextualizado de palavras por um termo genérico, impõe uma generalidade prejudicial. Há exemplos paradigmáticos que reconhecemos quase de forma imediata, como acontece com “os media”. A expressão \"os *media*\" passou a substituir as palavras \"jornais\", \"telejornais\", \"canais de televisão\", \"mecanismos de transmissão de informação\", \"jornalistas\", e mais importante, “parcialidade”, “manipulação”, “posição enviesada”, e “conluio”. Uma preferência do geral pelo particular que, mesmo sob o pretexto de imediatismo ou facilidade de comunicação, não cumpre esta função. Ainda que “conluio” ou “parcialidade” não sejam sinónimos ou equivalentes de “*media”*, o modo como “*os* *media*” é empregue social e discursivamente, faz com que estas palavras passem a ser *permutáveis*. Ou pelo menos, torna-se possível que assim seja. Quando a palavra é desvirtuada desta forma tendemos para uma imprecisão que pode ser, e frequentemente é, nociva. Este é apenas um exemplo de um tipo de aplicação de uma prática, que se encontra hoje disseminada dentro e fora do espaço digital. O que a partir dela podemos afirmar é que uma utilização de tal forma genérica e incerta constitui um risco.\n\n            Vemos o mesmo acontecer com os termos “ideologia”, “*fake news*”, “extrema-esquerda”, “fascismo”, “comunismo”, “politicamente correto”, “feminismo”, “democracia”, “negacionista” ou “desinformação”, por exemplo. Nesta utilização de palavras que se apresentam enquanto substituto de outras, reside a possibilidade de agregar à palavra *vísivel*, ao seu campo de significação, significados que são incompatíveis com a palavra original ou com a palavra visível. A questão não se prende, portanto, com poder, ou não, utilizar determinada palavra desta ou de outra forma, mas sim com um problema de imprecisão, indefinição e incompreensão. Um problema de *indeterminação epistémica*.\n\n            Claro que esta constatação não pretende sugerir uma utilização “correta” da palavra ou defender um entendimento unívoco e singular que regulamente a utilização de cada palavra. Palavras encontram-se associadas a um núcleo significacional, a um determinado conjunto de significados, que fornece um sentido a essa palavra num contexto e grupo social específico. Ainda que seja possível (e necessário) atualizar e rever esses núcleos significacionais em determinados momentos, esse núcleo não pode comportar tudo. O sentido de cada palavra tem de permanecer mais ou menos definido para que a palavra mantenha uma capacidade comunicacional dentro de determinado contexto.\n\n            Nomes e tantas outras palavras são definidas e determinadas pelo uso que delas é feita através de um conjunto de instâncias pragmáticas (Kripke, 2018: 122). A dificuldade que temos, enquanto coletivo, em concordar sobre o que constitui, por exemplo, fascismo ou negacionismo, advém da gradual volatilidade com que ambas as palavras são implementadas, uso que passa a ser de tal modo genérico, aberto e não-específico que quase inutiliza as “instâncias pragmáticas” que de outra forma, dariam sentido (especificidade) à palavra.\n\n            Num primeiro nível o que constatamos é, por isso, uma aparente dissolução da palavra, uma redução da sua repercussão. Uma utilização que dissolve, ou desgasta, o seu fundo de verdade na esfera pública. Esta dissolução é aqui entendida próxima de uma ideia de diluição e corrosão. No entanto, as palavras não desaparecem. Pelo contrário, mantêm-se e atualizam-se. A dissolução destas palavras no domínio público recobre algo mais objetivo. Ainda que estas palavras acabem por ser descaracterizadas, na realidade, o que se verifica é uma multiplicação dos significados nelas contidos.\n\n            Palavras como “*media*” ou “*fascismo*” passam a comportar um maior número de possibilidades e significados. Ou antes, a utilização que delas é feita passa a atribuir-lhes uma maior capacidade significativa. Ainda que a aparência seja uma de dissolução, o que se verifica é uma multiplicação semântica. E isto é relevante porque, entre outros aspetos, significa que passa a existir uma fenda muito maior a partir da qual se abre espaço para um abismo comunicativo, onde dois ou mais locutores se podem referir a vários significados distintos, comportados pela mesma palavra. No decorrer da pandemia, “negacionista” começou por substituir “aqueles que discordam ou contestam a gravidade da doença da Covid-19”. Devido à utilização que foi sendo feita desta palavra acima de tudo por mecanismos de distribuição de informação, “negacionista” passou também a substituir “aqueles que contestam ou questionam medidas de segurança e contenção epidemiológica”, “os que recusam a vacina”, “os que se manifestam contra medidas de confinamento” ou “os que negam a existência da doença Covid-19”. Todos estes significados são distintos e todos eles contribuem para uma multiplicação do significado fundamental de “a entidade que nega factos considerados verdadeiros”. Uma extensa multiplicação semântica a este nível revela que casos como estes não estão relacionados com uma subjetividade individual, mas com um problema de concordância e de indeterminação epistémica. Esta utilização extrema a posição de dois ou mais locutores, indetermina o referente da palavra “negacionista” e aprofunda um abismo comunicacional entre os locutores que a aplicam.\n\n            É graças às práticas de descontextualização de informação, da deturpação ou eliminação de um contexto específico, que se viabiliza um problema de imprecisão e indeterminação linguística no regime de pós-verdade. Se não existe uma necessidade de clarificar e contextualizar ao que nos estamos a referir, a nossa utilização de determinada palavra pode ser muito mais abrangente.\n\n            Isto acaba por ter consequências importantes. Palavras são redutos de intenções e significados. A incorporação de um conjunto de palavras no nosso léxico constitui a aquisição de um vocabulário. Um conjunto de palavras ou vocabulário constitui um sistema de conhecimento. Por sua vez, uma aquisição de um vocabulário é uma interiorização, absorção e adoção de um sistema de conhecimento (Godelier, 2020). Se aprender a falar implica aprender a pensar e a viver, da mesma forma, uma apropriação linguística é uma apropriação de um modelo comunicativo específico e subjetivo e, por isso mesmo, de uma forma de pensar (Ibid).\n\n            Sublinhamos a adoção desta nova utilização linguística como a adoção de um sistema de conhecimento. A incorporação deste tipo de linguagem num determinado vocabulário não é inócua. Pelo contrário, esta linguagem retém e transfere para o seu interlocutor e para as suas práticas discursivas, o seu caráter generalista, não-particular, não-específico. As palavras que utilizamos condicionam o entendimento que fazemos da informação subsequente que nos chega, e condicionam as possíveis leituras e reconfigurações que a partir delas conseguimos, ou não, fazer. De forma simples, a utilização deste tipo de linguagem condiciona, no sentido em que limita, uma expressão verbal e um modo de pensar.\n\n            Como referimos, a apropriação de um determinado vocabulário ou sistema de conhecimento, implica uma apropriação de uma forma de pensar. Consideremos a sequência: (i) assimilamos os dados fenomenológicos com que nos confrontamos; (ii) convertemos esses dados em informação; (iii) lemos e interpretamos essa informação; (iv) atribuímos significado a essa informação; (v) exteriorizamos informação através da discursividade; (vi) convertemos discurso, através do outro, em nova informação; (vii) assimilamos nova informação. Ao \"implementarmos\" um vocabulário simplificado, a exteriorização de uma expressão verbal constituída por este vocabulário, irá por sua vez informar e atualizar o sistema biológico de processamento de informação, que é o locutor.\n\n            Graças ao trabalho de Thomas Metzinger sabemos, ou é pelo menos altamente provável, que o “*self-model*” do sujeito cognitivo consciente é uma ferramenta usada por sistema de processamento de informação, por cada sujeito, de forma a tornar um certo tipo de informação cognitivamente disponível ou acessível (2004:403). “Once a transparent self-model of a being a volitional subject and a bodily agent is in place, new information becomes globally available. In particular, information becomes *cognitively* available.”(2004: 409, 410). Para além de ser um sistema biológico de processamento de informação, definição que deve ser sublinhada, para Metzinger, fundamental à condição de sujeito cognitivo é também a relação episódica *sujeito-objeto* (2004: 411). Todo o sujeito cognitivamente consciente encontra-se sempre em relação com determinado objeto ou sujeito, em cada determinada instância. Tal como o autor refere, uma perceção cognitiva consciente não existe em vácuo. Pelo contrário, depende do seu contexto e ambiente. Para Metzinger isto significa que perceção e ação não são níveis separados. “We are simultaneously perceiving *and* acting subjects” (2004: 409). Para além disto, inerente à condição de sujeito cognitivo consciente tem de existir uma relação dinâmica e, de certo modo, recíproca com esse mesmo contexto. “Full-blown conscious experience is more than the existence of a conscious self, and it is much more than the mere presence of a world. It results from the dynamic interplay between this self and the world, in a lived, embodied present.” (2004: 417). O sujeito cognitivo, ou o sistema biológico de processamento de informação, existe dependente e inerentemente informado pelo seu mundo e pela sua realidade particular, com as quais contacta e se atualiza reciprocamente.  \n\n            A partir daqui parece ser possível afirmar que a utilização de um determinado sistema linguístico específico pode condicionar uma forma de cognição. Este condicionamento pode ser mais ou menos evidente, mas se a linguagem da qual fazemos uso é simples e limitada, tal parece sugerir que a nossa leitura e interpretação do mundo será também ela reduzida e simplificada. A apreensão fenomenológica do que nos é exterior acaba por ficar reduzida, tendo em conta a linguagem simplificada que temos ao nosso dispor para traduzir os estímulos exteriores, fenomenologicamente apreendidos, para o próprio sistema biológico. Ou seja, este novo regime linguístico é muito mais do que a mera introdução de determinadas palavras na esfera social. É, também, a disseminação de sistemas de conhecimento, que contêm em si a possibilidade de afetar uma leitura fenomenológica do real.\n\n            A introdução deste regime linguístico, que pode ser visto como uma porta de entrada para uma perceção cognitiva atualizada, gera uma pergunta: é este novo regime linguístico um prenúncio de um novo conjunto de prioridades, ou condiciona ele esse conjunto de prioridades? Se uma outra forma de comunicação é introduzida no espaço social, caracterizada por uma nova lógica comunicativa, predisposta a uma maior indeterminação e pluralidade semântica, que necessidades é que esta nova forma comunicativa vem satisfazer? Ou seja, vem este domínio linguístico colmatar uma qualquer necessidade que já se encontrava presente, ou é a ideia de “um novo conjunto de prioridades”, justamente condicionada e motivada pela emergência desta forma comunicativa? É tornada visível por ela, ou é um resultado direto dela?\n\n            Segundo Saul Kripke, a descrição de um nome não nos dá o significado, nem confere um sinónimo, desse nome (2018: 60). Uma descrição apenas fixa o referente deste nome. Por sua vez, é como identificamos e definimos um objeto, fenomenologicamente, que fixa o seu referente.\n\n            Em *Naming and Necessity* um dos pontos que se destaca é a relevância dada à cadeia de comunicação inerente ao processo de nomear. Para Kripke a cadeia de comunicação real pela qual determinado nome próprio nos chega, de sujeito para sujeito, é mais importante do que a forma como determinado locutor determina o referente, ou se o referente deste nome está exatamente e claramente identificado (Kripke, 1981: 91, 92, 95). É na constituição de uma cadeia comunicacional que se formula o conteúdo do nome para o “locutor”, para aquele que o verbaliza, e para a “comunidade”. É “em virtude da nossa conceção com outros oradores na comunidade”, através do seu uso repetido, que conferimos significado a determinado termo, e acabamos por consolidar determinado significado.  \n\n            Muitas das palavras que apontámos – verdade, ideologia, media – operam enquanto *cluster concepts,* o que apresenta uma dificuldade. Para nos podermos desemaranhar deste problema não nos devemos fixar no *verdadeiro* referente de determinada palavra, qualquer que ele seja, mas sim no processo ativo de ressignificação que sustenta a existência e visibilidade de determinada palavra. Isto, por sua vez, coloca outro obstáculo: como é que sabemos do que é que estamos a falar se a palavra está permanentemente suscetível de uma contínua ressignificação? Uma possível solução passa por uma implementação de práticas de contextualização. É por isto mesmo que se torna relevante falarmos de cadeias de comunicação. É na aparência e na confirmação da aparência de determinada palavra no seio de um determinado grupo que se confirma a coincidência de um conjunto de características fenomenológicas, que são depois depuradas e perpetuadas pelos elementos desse grupo (Kripke, 2018: 131, 135). É através desta cadeia histórica causal, e pelo elo por ela criado, que clarificamos e que tornamos possível uma contextualização semântica e discursiva.\n\n            Neste processo da multiplicação semântica existem possibilidades e existem riscos. Se depositamos uma subjetividade cada vez maior nas palavras, tal como aqui sugerimos, confrontamo-nos com possíveis obstáculos. Em primeiro lugar defrontamo-nos com o risco de uma maior indeterminação epistémica, ou seja, com a dificuldade de perceber a que referente, informação ou objeto determinado significante se reporta especificamente. Por outro lado, uma multiplicação semântica dá aso a uma maior entropia que, por sua vez, contribui para uma maior dispersão e desorganização linguística. Mais dados, mais desordem e consequentemente uma maior dificuldade em discernir e selecionar a partir de um espaço assoberbado pela falta de significado. Por último, esta dispersão possibilita um desalinhamento entre locutores, ou o que apelidámos de abismo comunicativo. Ao comportarem cada vez mais significados, geram-se oportunidades para que dois ou mais locutores apliquem palavras para as quais cada locutor associa um referente, ou entendimento distinto.\n\n            Dito isto, esta alteração não tem de ser necessariamente negativa. Ainda que se deva a muito mais do que isto, a dificuldade que temos em cooperar coletivamente para lá dos nossos grupos mais imediatos deve-se a um *des*entendimento sobre as mesmas conceções ou palavras, a uma indefinição e indeterminação epistémica que contribui depois para uma fragmentação de práticas e de conhecimentos. Se o formato discursivo atual não satisfaz as necessidades de determinados grupos, faz sentido que possamos adotar outras linguagens mais eficazes. Se a informação e as práticas de conhecimento são formas importantes de organizar o mundo (Wark, 2016: 148), será fundamental que adotemos as linguagens mais adequadas para cada contexto e necessidades específicas. Desta forma, o que se manifesta através do que aqui apelidamos de “multiplicação semântica” pode ser um processo de uma adaptação de uma insuficiência numa possível satisfação de novas prioridades comunicativas.  \n\n            O sistema linguístico que se tem vindo a desenvolver no regime do pós-verdade, pode ser apenas uma continuação, uma atualização, frequentemente impercetível, dos nossos discursos – uma prática discursiva e textual atualizada. Neste momento, este sistema parece gerar alguns problemas. Mas não poderá ser ele uma reação necessária às incapacidades das nossas capacidades de comunicação antes dela, dentro e fora do espaço digital? Se estas não são eficazes, funcionais e adequadas a quaisquer que possam a ser as nossas necessidades, não fará sentido melhorá-las?\n\n \n\n## Práticas de Produção de Conhecimento\n\n \n\n               Diferentes modos de organização e sociabilidade acabam por estar associados a modelos económicos distintos. As diferentes eras pré-históricas, feudais, industriais e capitalistas assim o confirmam. Em “Tribes, Institutions, Markets, Networks: A Framework about Societal Evolution” (1996) David Ronfeldt define quatro modos de organização essenciais:  Tribos, caracterizadas por sistemas de linhagem ou parentesco; instituições hierárquicas, caracterizadas por uma centralização de poder assente em cadeias de autoridade; mercados assentes em trocas competitivas abertas a iniciativas privadas; e redes, que se organizam heterarquicamente, de modo descentralizado, e que são, segundo Ronfeldt, multiorganizacionais. Como Kei Kreutler (2021) concluiu a partir do artigo de Ronfeldt, a promessa de novas formas de organização social e económica que vemos hoje surgir, correlaciona-se com o desenvolvimento das tecnologias de informação, com o surgimento da internet e, adicionaríamos nós, com a financeirização do espaço digital.\n\n            Desta perspetiva faz sentido que este seja um momento de rutura. O domínio capitalista, o prolongado *realismo capitalista*, é por excelência o domínio da acumulação e centralização de capitais. Ao falar de uma “promessa de novas formas de organização”, Kei Kreutler refere-se especificamente ao modelo económico e, consequentemente, aos modos de sociabilidade viabilizados a partir da *blockchain*. A introdução deste modelo assente num sistema de transação descentralizado, contesta esse aparente realismo e parece sugerir, no mínimo, uma outra possibilidade de transação económica. Ao operar de forma descentralizada, o que neste caso específico significa que as transações económicas são confirmadas, asseguradas e protegidas por ação de outros utilizadores e não por instituições bancárias, a *blockchain* tem oferecido uma possível alternativa relativamente à transação de *tokens*, ainda que, simultaneamente, retenha e exacerbe muitos outros problemas. O que aqui se torna importante referir, é que ao operarem de forma descentralizada, as organizações *multiorganizacionais*, ou em rede, estabelecem uma dinâmica heterárquica, ou seja, uma organização que rejeita uma hierarquia e assenta numa colaboração flexível entre membros autónomos, que ainda assim podem conciliar objetivos de modo interdependente (Ronfeldt, 1996; Kreutler, 2021). Esta viragem, este redirecionar da engrenagem sugere, e último caso possibilita, uma reconfiguração dos modos de organização social e o que estes condicionam. Poderá ser argumentado que não é uma solução viável a longo-prazo. Talvez. O que é verdade é que o aparecimento da *blockchain* em conjunto com a emergência de novas dinâmicas e organizações sociais, de novos aparatos tecnológicos, com a degradação e reconfiguração da organização laboral, e com a insuficiência partidária política, anuncia inevitavelmente novas prioridades e necessidades a nível social.\n\n            Se adotarmos esta perspetiva, as recentes atualizações dos modos de produção, distribuição e consumo de informação e a dificuldade de saber como nos devemos dirigir ao conhecimento –  se o devemos distribuir profusamente, se o devemos limitar (se sim em que cenários e segundo que critérios), se devemos adotar medidas ou mecanismos de proteção ainda mais ativos – podem ser vistas como  resultado ou consequência da transformação ao nível da organização social (institucional, coletiva, global) a que estamos a ser sujeitos, e da qual fazemos parte. Acima de tudo porque os modos de distribuição de informação, as nossas práticas discursivas e o conteúdo da nossa comunicação interpessoal existem sempre em relação às práticas de produção de conhecimento, às ideologias que condicionam uma existência “tecno-social” (Wark, 2016) e “tecno-linguística” (Berardi, 2019), e aos dispositivos e mecanismos tecnológicos que dão forma à nossa realidade e contribuem para a constituição de *worldviews*, epistemologias e cosmologias concretas (que, por sua vez, regem vocabulários, dinâmicas de intersubjetividade e regulamentações do real) (Gardels, 2021). A produção de conhecimento não surge de forma neutra e imaculada, mas é em cada momento condicionada e influenciada, quer na sua forma quer no seu conteúdo, pelo contexto que a constrói.  \n\n            É talvez por estarmos numa fase de transição de modelos económicos ou de modos de organização – de uma centralização em direção a uma descentralização (de recursos, atenção, informação) ou de uma hierarquização para uma multiorganização – que surge a dificuldade de como  devemos distribuir informação. Como a devemos distribuir, em primeiro lugar, para cada grupo e contexto, como é que a devemos distribuir da forma mais relevante e incorrendo no menor número de perigos possíveis (Metzinger, 2021), como é que devemos preservar e organizar a produção de conhecimento, e que vocabulários e linguagens é que devemos implementar ou disponibilizar em cada contexto. A problemática introduzida da dissolução da palavra e da multiplicação semântica faz parte de uma problemática linguística e comunicacional, mas reporta-se acima de tudo à dificuldade de *organizar* o mundo (Wark, 2016), de organizar conhecimento e de clarificar a forma como comunicamos.\n\n            Como sabemos, os métodos de organização social não definem apenas as dinâmicas internas de cada grupo a nível interpessoal, mas as suas práticas constituintes, nomeadamente, práticas de produção de conhecimento. O espaço ocidental democrático existe sobre uma *aparência* de acesso universal ao conhecimento, sobre a qual, pode até ser argumentado, foi construída uma certa identificação. Ainda que seja evidente, fará sentido destacar, por um lado, que a distribuição de conhecimento é distinta da distribuição de informação, e por outro, que sempre existiram mecanismos de proteção de conhecimento.\n\n             Vários autores têm alertado para possíveis perigos associados à disseminação desregulada de informação e conhecimento. Não apenas o facto de em determinados casos ser *benéfico* para nós, enquanto coletivo, promover ignorância, mas também o facto de, frequentemente, mais conhecimento tornar as coisas piores (Bostrom, 2011: 30). Segundo Nick Bostrom, um compromisso com uma produção de conhecimento ilimitada e desregulada acarreta custos, riscos e perigos. “It is said that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. It is an open question whether more knowledge is safer. Even if our best bet that more knowledge is on average good, we should recognize that here numerous cases in which more knowledge makes things worse.” (2011: 30). É importante mantermos em mente que pode ser a própria busca por uma maior clarificação epistémica, e por mais conhecimento no geral, que nos pode colocar em perigo, ou que pode ser ela própria danosa (Metzinger, 2021: 46, 48).\n\n            Bostrom não está sozinho. Em entrevista à *Kunstkritik,* McKenzie Wark diz-nos: “As a pedagogy, the Enlightenment project was about increasing the availability of information, to let rational people know and decide to end censorship and mystification. It now turns out the Enlightenment project to get knowledge to propagate produces so much noise that you now have to create less visibility. The problem now is to make most information go away.” (Dunker, 2021).\n\n            Deparamo-nos com o problema de perder informação, de fornecer informação que nos pode pôr em risco, ou com a expropriação e exploração de informação. É por este motivo que para Wark a ideia de *assimetria de informação* se torna importante. Uma assimetria de informação acontece quando existe um desequilíbrio entre duas partes, no qual uma das partes controla mais informação do que a outra. Se esta dinâmica surgiu inicialmente de um enquadramento económico, esta acontece hoje predominantemente no espaço tecnológico e digital, onde se torna possível, mais facilmente, uma apropriação de informação que nos permite ela mesma controlar recursos. Ao controlar os recursos materiais e as ordens protocolares que estruturam o movimento e o acesso desses recursos, o domínio informativo passa a subsumir em si um controlo económico e financeiro. Esta é a verdadeira besta que se ergue do mar, a produção insidiosa e o controlo de informação que domina e *regula* sub-repticiamente, por mais implícito seja, a nossa realidade.\n\n            Esta expropriação e assimilação de informação por grandes entidades privadas envolve-se, por meio de assimetrias de informação e outros processos mais complexos, em mecanismos de análise de *big data*, ou seja, através de uma compilação categorização e separação de grandes conjuntos de dados. Embora estes dados sejam frequentemente interpretados como elementos abstratos, passíveis de utilização por qualquer entidade, é por norma esta mesma perceção que obstrui um entendimento claro de que são os processos analíticos e operações algorítmicas *aplicadas* sobre estes mesmos dados, que guiam e condicionam a nossa atenção e perceção e, consequentemente, os resultados obtidos.\n\n            Como vários autores têm referido, não é possível entender a relação estabelecida entre práticas governativas e *big data*, sem nos debruçarmos sobre as tecnologias que sustentam e produzem novas visibilidades e novos alvos de governação. “*What* problems are being made visible through big data for development depends to some degree on *how* the underlying data is visualized and *who* is captured in the visualizations. The “how” of visualization is important because choices concerning the logics of categorization beneath the visual representations are controversial.“ (Flyverbom, Madsen, & Rasche, 2017).\n\n            Em processos como as assimetrias de informação, o foco dado ao reconhecimento de padrões em detrimento de *hypothesis-testing*, não só dá aso a práticas de descontextualização e desintegração de informação, como potencia o risco de produzir conhecimento que aparenta ser legítimo, quando não o é. Em 2021 a questão mantém-se: “How does the rationalization of knowledge impact the ways individuals and organizatins are made accountable for the effects of policies and governance initiatives?” (Flyverbom, Madsen, & Rasche, 2017: 16). Racionalização é aqui relevante visto nos que remete para o modo como a informação a partir da qual o conhecimento é produzido é extraída, estruturada e organizada. Racionalização salienta também que a produção de conhecimento está dependente das suas práticas. Dependente das linguagens implementadas para comunicar e materializar esse conhecimento, do modo como esse conhecimento é distribuído e partilhado, das tecnologias e ferramentas aplicadas para a produção e sistematização de conhecimento e, acima de tudo, do modo *como*, e *por quem*, essas tecnologias e ferramentas são programadas e calibradas para funcionar. A expressão operativa que as práticas de produção de conhecimento adquirem está, por isso, dependente de um conjunto de condicionantes, que são hoje predominantemente informadas pelo sistema de organização económico-financeiro vigente. Claro que o conhecimento pode ser, e é frequentemente, produzido fora deste sistema e domínio de “automatismos tecno-linguísticos” (Berardi, 2019). Mas as práticas institucionais e organizacionais de conhecimento no espaço ocidental, mantém-se dependentes desta lógica.\n\n            Como temos vindo a sugerir, é justamente o elo que se efetiva entre *informação*–*tecnologia–governação* que torna possível uma *regulamentação do real*. No momento em que um destes elementos se altera ou transforma, os outros elementos ficam desfasados de uma realidade que se encontra em atualização. Desadequados às necessidades de uma realidade que, entretanto, é outra.\n\n            E o que é que pode ser entendido por regulamentação do real? Uma regulamentação do real materializa-se na efetivação de processos executivos, legislativos e protocolares que são viabilizados pela informação extraída de ferramentas e aparatos tecnológicos. É através destes aparatos, que são neste momento predominantemente computacionais, e da informação deles extraídos que se torna possível condicionar um conjunto de processos legislativos e protocolares (leis, contratos, regulamentos, … ). Processos eleitorais são o exemplo paradigmático do que pode ser uma regulamentação do real, ainda que as regulamentações mais significativas sejam, por norma, mais impercetíveis. Testemunhámos isto mesmo com os eventos desencadeados pelas empresas privadas da *Cambridge Analytica* e *Aggregate IQ* em 2016, e com a influência que tiveram nas eleições americanas e no referendo do Brexit, respetivamente. Sabemos que através dos dados de utilizadores usurpados, ambas as empresas direcionaram informação específica, em grande parte falsificada e descontextualizada, através das quais os utilizadores poderiam confirmar crenças pessoais que fossem de encontro ao objetivo requerido por ambas as empresas. Casos como estes deixam evidente que a informação que é controlada e detida contém a possibilidade de reger não apenas processos legislativos, mas a informação que gere a própria informação (Wark, 2019). Passa a ser a informação burocrática e contratual que rege recursos naturais, minerais, humanos e mercadorias. Desta forma, a regulamentação do real acontece ou torna-se possível, quando uma entidade assegura informação que permite influenciar mecanismos constituintes das esferas de governação política, económica ou social.\n\n            Por ser resultado de uma interconexão e interação de vários mecanismos, esta regulamentação nem sempre é óbvia ou explícita. Ademais, importa referir que esta regulamentação, esta aplicação de condicionantes e regulamentos não é inerentemente nociva ou, apenas por si só, um policiamento, ainda que contenha em si a possibilidade de o ser. Como frequentemente acontece, uma biblioteca pode, por exemplo, limitar ou condicionar o acesso a obras raras, fisicamente sensíveis ou já danificadas a um determinado grupo de entidades, por norma, investigadores especializados. Esta medida é colocada em vigor de modo a preservar as obras e, consequentemente, de forma a preservar fontes de conhecimento. Através desta medida protocolar são constituídas realidades nas quais, caso não sejamos investigadores especializados, não temos acesso a um determinado conjunto de conhecimentos. No entanto, se for implementado um regulamento que, sob o pretexto da preservação de conhecimento, restrinja ou impeça, por exemplo, o estudo ou o acesso a documentos históricos que comprovem e documentem longas práticas de discriminação social ou racial dentro de um determinado país, de modo que uma inacessibilidade desses documentos contribua para uma continuação, ou até aumento, da discriminação social e violação de direitos humanos dentro desse país, estamos perante um processo de regulamentação do real que contribui para a promoção de discriminação social, ignorância epistémica e desconhecimento histórico.\n\n            O que aqui se torna importante sublinhar é que a palavra detém um papel fundamental no processo de regulamentação do real. Por isso mesmo, as discursividades que aplicamos, e que dentro do domínio digital podem ser posteriormente apropriadas de forma a tentar produzir conhecimento, não são apenas palavras. São construções ativas que se concentram em depósitos de possibilidade para regulamentar o real.\n\n            As práticas de produção de conhecimento, os processos de transmissão de informação e os processos de assimilação e exploração de informação (como as assimetrias de informação), coincidem num ponto comum. Todos estes procuram produzir instâncias de verdade. Ou pelo menos facilitar a sua identificação. Se estamos a testemunhar uma atualização linguística e se existem categorias epistemológicas que estão a deixar de fazer sentido no regime do pós-verdade, talvez a nossa relação com a verdade tenha de ser outra.\n\n            A identificação destas questões leva Anna Lorusso a sugerir mudar o foco da categoria de verdade para a categoria de legitimidade. Enquanto o conceito de verdade tem um caráter universalista – o que é verdade é sempre verdade, independentemente de espaço, tempo ou locutor – o conceito de legitimidade depende (i) da referência a um contexto específico, de um (ii) reconhecimento social, e (iii) de uma dimensão processual. Legitimidade foca-se em componentes de adequação e justificação, e depende de uma conformidade com um conjunto de normas culturais e regras legislativas. A partir do domínio da legitimidade são estabelecidos um conjunto de limites, passíveis de atualização e revisão, que facilitam a organização e clarificação de processos comunicativos e práticas de conhecimento. “Any rule is historical and, therefore, subject to change, but until it is valid, it defines certain boundaries, and what transgresses these boundaries is illegitimate.” (Lorusso, 2020). Segundo a autora, ao contrário de um julgamento de verdade que estipula uma dinâmica de correspondência que está hoje desadequada, julgamentos de legitimidade relacionam uma declaração com uma rede de regras intersubjetivas fornecidas por um sistema socialmente reconhecido. Considerarmos a legitimidade de uma declaração implica, segundo esta perspetiva, relacionar esta declaração com uma rede de outras declarações que a tornam aceitável, ou não.\n\n            A grande vantagem da perspetiva de Lorusso reside no ênfase que é dado à necessidade de estabelecer uma regulamentação que não incorra em censura, e à relevância dada a atos de reconhecimento, de interpretação, de conformidade e de uma constituição de relações em redes que permitam múltiplas verificações. “Competences of speakers, adequacy of statements to the whole cultural system, and pragmatic and systematic effects are, in some cases, our guardrail, the limits to interpretative freedom. If the judgement of legitimacy implies an interpretative work, this interpretative work is not entirely unbridled. It does not have the guarantee of a strong, abstract criterion of truth; it cannot consist of an automatic and objective verification, but has the limits of a reasonable work of interpretation. “ (Lorusso, 2020: 1016).\n\n            Aqui coincidem a demarcação de um sistema em rede, no qual existe a possibilidade de exercitar julgamentos de legitimidade e de inquirir sobre a validade destes mesmos julgamentos, através de um exercício de poder *adequado* e *correspondente* a um reconhecimento coletivo, que existe contida num sistema de verificação contextual, plural e passível de revisão. Todos estes aspetos contribuem para a sistematização do que pode ser considerado um conjunto de *práticas de contextualização*.\n\n            A contribuição de Anna Lorusso incide sobre uma questão maior. Através de uma reformulação do vocabulário, é avançada uma alteração que promove práticas de contextualização, a partir das quais se torna possível reconfigurar um enquadramento epistemológico. É possível afirmar que privilegiar práticas de contextualização pressupõem uma redução da informação global, dado que informação que é contextualizada gera menos entropia ao relacionar-se com uma rede referencial? Será possível afirmar que privilegiar práticas de contextualização contribuem para uma clarificação comunicativa?\n\n            Todos os apelos que temos vindo a assistir relativos à atualização de vocabulários, ao abandono de linguagens obsoletas que não nos devem acompanhar para o futuro, e a insistência nas ideias de *validade*, *pertinência*, *apropriação* e *legitimidade*, (Bratton, 2021: 45, 50) reconhecem que os regulamentos, protocolos ou quaisquer outros mecanismos a aplicar devem responder, em primeiro lugar, a enquadramentos contextuais específicos. Apropriado e legítimo, *para quem*?\n\n            No início deste segmento referimos que a organização social subjacente a um determinado corpo coletivo é determinante para a forma e conteúdo do conhecimento que é produzido. Ideias como o *Horizonte de possibilidade* de que Franco Berardi (2019) fala, ou as *biopolíticas positivas* de Benjamin Bratton (2021), surgem de um reconhecimento das insuficiências das presentes organizações sociais. Insuficiências que são reconvertidas em depósitos de possibilidade, a partir das quais se procura convocar práticas e relações compostas e multifacetadas.\n\n            A introdução do conceito de “biopolíticas positivas”, tal como a legitimidade referida por Lorusso, são sintomáticas de uma sensibilidade que entende que o foco deve estar na *nuance* das metodologias aplicadas. Tal como muitos oradores do Ciclo, Lorusso e Bratton entendem a importância de falar a linguagem dos nossos tempos. Dicotomias simplificadas como vigilância *versus* anti-vigilância, como Bratton refere – e às quais poderíamos adicionar corrupção *versus* anti-corrupção ou verdade *versus* mentira – não suficientes para pensar de forma sustentável o futuro e devem ser substituídas por “vocabulários policromáticos”. Ou seja, talvez devam ser pensados enquanto poliedros, e não enquanto binómios. As contribuições de Foucault ou Shoshana Zuboff são inegavelmente úteis. Mas isto não significa que estejam livres de qualquer reformulação ou atualização, ou que sejam intrinsecamente suficientes. Do mesmo modo que uma regulamentação do real pode e deve ser utilizada para um desenvolvimento social alargado e para uma melhoria das nossas condições laborais, habitacionais e comunitárias, também formas de modelação, observação e deteção social (o que Bratton apelida de *social sensing*) podem contribuir para um maior desenvolvimento e entendimento coletivo (Bratton, 2021: 45). Repetimos: estas práticas não são intrinsecamente negativas. É o modo como são aplicadas que o determina. E é para estas metodologias que devemos também dirigir a nossa atenção.\n\n            Na ideia de regulamentação do real converge a palavra, um determinado núcleo social e a produção de conhecimento. Como a palavra é aplicada condiciona uma aplicação social da mesma, e os atos de regulamentação do real que são informados pela produção de conhecimento que, de alguma forma, incorpora essa(s) palavra(s). Da palavra, ao aparato que captura a palavra, passando pela constituição do conhecimento, até ao corpo social.\n\n            A dissolução da palavra e a regulamentação do real podem ser encarados como problemas de organização. Como organizamos informação, como organizamos e implementamos aparatos tecnológicos, como organizamos conhecimento. Falar de práticas de produção de conhecimento implica falar de organizações sociais e do(s) modelo(s) de regulamentação do real que possibilitam essas organizações, e por sua vez, essas ou outras práticas de produção de conhecimento. Considerar e incidir na ideia de práticas de contextualização é insistir na possibilidade de organizar e sistematizar de outra forma. Na possibilidade de atualizar modelos comunicativos, aproximando-os das necessidades que se mantêm por cumprir.  \n\n \n\n## Depois do Fim da Verdade Objetiva\n\n \n\n             O Fim da Verdade Objetiva foi convocado para questionar segundo que modelos nos regemos daqui para a frente. Depois do fim da verdade objetiva, olhamos para o abismo e o abismo olha de volta para nós sem grandes respostas.\n\n            Sabemos pelo menos, ou é-nos sugerido, que existem tipos de organizações que se começam a estruturar segundo dinâmicas diferentes. Organizações económicas, sociais e informacionais. Aqui destacámos a ideia de dissolução enquanto multiplicação semântica (que foi pensada relativa a um regime linguístico, mas que se pode estender até sistemas de regulamentação ou organização). É no centro do domínio informativo e nas práticas dos mecanismos de transmissão de informação que testemunhamos uma das mais importantes reestruturações. Motivo pelo qual procurámos destacar as práticas degeneração e descontextualização informativa, que acabam por informar ou pelo menos estar correlacionas com práticas de regulamentação do real. É talvez, por um lado, o fim do entendimento unívoco no que toca a certas epistemologias, e por outro, a emergência de outras, que continuamos sem saber como serão implementadas ou organizadas.\n\n            Muitos dos nossos problemas advêm ainda de não conseguir descortinar a névoa que separa o domínio da representação e o domínio da realidade.  Se são as práticas de produção de conhecimento que nos permitem aproximar de uma progressiva solução ou clarificação entre esses dois domínios, é importante saber que práticas efetivam esse mesmo conhecimento. Falar de verdade é uma armadilha. Mas falar de legitimidade e validade leva-nos a considerar formas de conhecimento, práticas de conhecimento, práticas de contextualização de informação e cadeias comunicacionais. Uma atualização do nosso vocabulário, ainda que uma pequena como esta, possibilita uma configuração do modo como consideramos a ideia de verdade ou, mais importante, o que pode ocupar o lugar de veracidade. Quando aqui convocámos mecanismos de distribuição de informação, práticas de produção de conhecimento, práticas discursivas e práticas de contextualização, procurámos sublinhar o modo como categorias epistemológicas e agentes e contextos específicos se “co-produzem in actu” (Kleeberg, 2020).  \n\n            Por último, há um aspeto a reconhecer. A incidência neste conjunto específico de palavras – descentralização, regulamentação, dissolução, contrato, protocolo, etc – é contextual e muito provavelmente não irá resistir à passagem do tempo. Em muitos aspetos, estas não são as palavras corretas e esta não é a linguagem adequada. Mas nelas concentra-se o desejo de comunicar com outras palavras, com outros léxicos, de conceber conhecimento de outra forma ou, no mínimo, de concentrar atenção nos enquadramentos e limitações no qual este é concebido.\n\n            Depois do fim da verdade objetiva, abre-se espaço para conceber outros regulamentos, outros modos de organização e outras formas de comunicação. Estas propostas e modelos têm de ser avançados o mais rápido possível, antes que o horizonte de possibilidade se evapore.", "timestamp": 1635086224, "digest": "1XyulG1i67pVVABAUnCe_zuBYW3z4mMTHN4QWLOo97w", "contributor": "0x91e0358706143e3944aF5c0bd43f426f61dc0a2e"}
{"id": "P0Xjdcu577pR6Mb_1Gq-Ii8qhmbjqSkHqx7a6lwhcLQ", "title": "On Words and Knowledge", "body": "## Binómios e Poliedros\n\nO Ciclo de conversas, debates e investigações *O Fim da Verdade Objetiva* usou frequentemente relações de dicotomia para desvelar e construir pensamento crítico. Neste projeto foram convocados binómios aos quais foi dado um destaque particular a uma das faces (imagens irresolutas, dissolução do real, verdades objetivas), deixando o seu reverso obscurecido. O objetivo foi não apenas analisar o conceito ao qual foi dado destaque, mas manifestar igualmente uma presença, através da sua ausência. Pensarmos a ideia de imagens irresolutas implica pensar o que é que pode constituir, ou não, uma imagem resoluta, ou se a própria noção de imagens resolvidas, terminadas, solucionadas, faz sequer sentido. Da mesma forma, proferir ou interagir com a ideia de verdade objetiva é o primeiro passo para perceber o quão irreconciliável a ideia de verdade e objetividade realmente são. No reverso desta ideia estará a ideia de verdade subjetiva, mas também a de verdade absoluta. Todas elas distintas, mas todas elas complementares. Por isto mesmo, fará mais sentido pensar em cada um destes conceitos, não tanto como duas faces de uma moeda, mas enquanto poliedros.\n\nAo longo deste texto serão destacadas determinadas faces de determinados poliedros, sejam eles regulares ou irregulares. Determinadas ideias, determinados conceitos, que irão, por sua vez, estar relacionadas com outras faces, que podem ou não estar aqui explícitas. Este texto irá considerar, em particular, o que é que constitui ou pode constituir uma dissolução da palavra, uma multiplicação semântica e uma regulamentação do real em 2021. Será a partir destas que nos vamos procurar debruçar de forma mais alargada no processo de atualização das atuais práticas discursivas, nas práticas de produção de conhecimento e nas práticas de contextualização.\n\nEm todas as suas vertentes, o Ciclo procurou promover posições autónomas e ativas, que se distanciassem de um consumo passivo de informação. O foco esteve sempre no desenvolvimento de pensamento crítico, idealmente em coletivo. Este texto procura espelhar isso mesmo.\n\n## Sobre a Dissolução da Palavra\n\nNo contexto do Ciclo foi introduzida a noção de dissolução. Das imagens e, em particular, das palavras, a partir da qual surgiu a equação: *dissolução da palavra = multiplicação semântica*. Para esta primeira secção as práticas discursivas que são viabilizadas e o modo como a palavra é empregue dentro do domínio digital são aspetos significativos. De forma a justificar a referência a esta equação, é importante contextualizarmos o nosso ponto de partida.\n\nComo tem sido várias vezes referido, a internet surgiu de forma a responder às necessidades do departamento de defesa dos Estados Unidos, em particular das suas necessidades militares. Depois de ser introduzida no espaço universitário, na sua fase de maturação, próximo do ano 2000, o espaço digital da internet começa a contribuir para um importante processo de produção e sistematização de informação, inicialmente segundo critérios democráticos. Mas o que começa por ser democrático, rapidamente deixa de o ser. A esperança atribuída ao espaço digital depressa se transforma numa crise, que se torna indiscutivelmente clara na segunda metade dos 2010s, na qual se instaura o regime de pós-verdade.\n\nEnquanto um *regime* específico de verdade, uma perspetiva de Anna Lorusso (2020) à qual subscrevemos, o regime do pós-verdade caracteriza-se não apenas por ter sido originado por *media* digitais, mas por ser *sustentado* e *mantido* por estes mesmos *media* digitais. É aqui que se passam a cruzar a esfera digital e a esfera material, espaço no qual são estipulados sistemas de poder e de verdade específicos (Lorusso, 2021: 1006). Por isto mesmo, para além da definição de um conjunto de práticas discursivas e de linguagens próprias, encontram-se já aqui implícitas, em particular, as linguagens e discursos que são viabilizados e aos quais são dados visibilidade dentro e fora do domínio digital. Ainda que este regime seja mais que isso, para este contexto fará sentido caracterizá-lo segundo três pontos fundamentais: os seus sistemas de poder, os seus sistemas de verdade e as suas práticas discursivas. Poder, verdade e linguagem.\n\nA concentração e centralização dos poderes exercidos, em simultâneo com a viabilização de um conjunto que práticas discursivas específicas que serão identificadas mais à frente, levaram-nos à financeirização do espaço digital. Esta financeirização – e aqui teremos de simplificar um longo processo – significou que os mecanismos de transmissão de informação passaram a privilegiar a quantidade do consumo e não a qualidade do consumo, aspeto que é indissociável e resultante do presente modelo económico. Esta decisão teve evidentemente impacto na forma como a palavra passou a ser empregue e utilizada. Ao passarem a estar dependentes do lucro gerado pela informação transmitida, os mecanismos de transmissão de informação procuraram maximizar a quantidade do consumo dos seus produtos. Mecanismos de transmissão de informação são aqui sinónimo de jornais, websites e meios de comunicação estruturalmente semelhantes, o que significa que os produtos comercializados são dados, informação e, menos frequentemente, conhecimento. Esta atualização marca um momento de charneira importante.\n\nEste processo de comercialização ou mercantilização da informação (Wark, 2019) passou a privilegiar práticas generalizadas de descontextualização de informação. Neste contexto os novos protagonistas passaram a ser os excertos e os segmentos informativos que permitiram uma relação superficial com a informação fragmentada que privilegiavam os dados e não tanto a informação, ou menos ainda conhecimento. A quantidade de consumo passou a ser otimizada quando permitia confirmar crenças individuais ou quando colocava, violentamente, essas crenças em dúvida. Ou, posto de outro modo, quando esta informação nos dizia o que queremos ouvir, ou quando nos destabilizava. Em ambos os casos, este consumo era potenciado quando existia uma manipulação ou descontextualização ativa, que enquadrasse esta informação numa das duas categorias anteriores. Foram em grande parte ações de fragmentação, reconfiguração e reapropriação de informação, que contribuíram para uma degeneração da informação (e não tanto uma “desinformação”), que permitiram práticas de descontextualização, que os mecanismos de transmissão de informação conseguiram atingir um maior consumo e, consequentemente, um maior lucro.\n\nO modo quantitativo como consumimos informação hoje é em grande parte resultado da financeirização do espaço digital. Da mesma forma, o desgaste da palavra é resultante do modo quantitativo como consumimos informação. Palavras são também elas redutos, de intenções e significados. Construções, portanto, que também podem ser alvo de desgaste. A descontextualização contínua da palavra e a sua aplicação excessiva contribuem para uma erosão que reduz a sua capacidade comunicativa. E o que é uma palavra que perdeu a sua capacidade comunicativa senão um artefacto desvirtuado?\n\nÉ através desta erosão que chegamos à ideia de dissolução da palavra. A utilização volátil de determinadas palavras, no espaço digital e a partir do espaço digital, reduz o campo linguístico de quem as utiliza, justamente porque esta utilização volátil, ao substituir um conjunto específico e contextualizado de palavras por um termo genérico, impõe uma generalidade prejudicial. Há exemplos paradigmáticos que reconhecemos quase de forma imediata, como acontece com “os media”. A expressão \"os *media*\" passou a substituir as palavras \"jornais\", \"telejornais\", \"canais de televisão\", \"mecanismos de transmissão de informação\", \"jornalistas\", e mais importante, “parcialidade”, “manipulação”, “posição enviesada”, e “conluio”. Uma preferência do geral pelo particular que, mesmo sob o pretexto de imediatismo ou facilidade de comunicação, não cumpre esta função. Ainda que “conluio” ou “parcialidade” não sejam sinónimos ou equivalentes de “*media”*, o modo como “*os* *media*” é empregue social e discursivamente, faz com que estas palavras passem a ser *permutáveis*. Ou pelo menos, torna-se possível que assim seja. Quando a palavra é desvirtuada desta forma tendemos para uma imprecisão que pode ser, e frequentemente é, nociva. Este é apenas um exemplo de um tipo de aplicação de uma prática, que se encontra hoje disseminada dentro e fora do espaço digital. O que a partir dela podemos afirmar é que uma utilização de tal forma genérica e incerta constitui um risco.\n\nVemos o mesmo acontecer com os termos “ideologia”, “*fake news*”, “extrema-esquerda”, “fascismo”, “comunismo”, “politicamente correto”, “feminismo”, “democracia”, “negacionista” ou “desinformação”, por exemplo. Nesta utilização de palavras que se apresentam enquanto substituto de outras, reside a possibilidade de agregar à palavra *vísivel*, ao seu campo de significação, significados que são incompatíveis com a palavra original ou com a palavra visível. A questão não se prende, portanto, com poder, ou não, utilizar determinada palavra desta ou de outra forma, mas sim com um problema de imprecisão, indefinição e incompreensão. Um problema de *indeterminação epistémica*.\n\nClaro que esta constatação não pretende sugerir uma utilização “correta” da palavra ou defender um entendimento unívoco e singular que regulamente a utilização de cada palavra. Palavras encontram-se associadas a um núcleo significacional, a um determinado conjunto de significados, que fornece um sentido a essa palavra num contexto e grupo social específico. Ainda que seja possível (e necessário) atualizar e rever esses núcleos significacionais em determinados momentos, esse núcleo não pode comportar tudo. O sentido de cada palavra tem de permanecer mais ou menos definido para que a palavra mantenha uma capacidade comunicacional dentro de determinado contexto.\n\nNomes e tantas outras palavras são definidas e determinadas pelo uso que delas é feita através de um conjunto de instâncias pragmáticas (Kripke, 2018: 122). A dificuldade que temos, enquanto coletivo, em concordar sobre o que constitui, por exemplo, fascismo ou negacionismo, advém da gradual volatilidade com que ambas as palavras são implementadas, uso que passa a ser de tal modo genérico, aberto e não-específico que quase inutiliza as “instâncias pragmáticas” que de outra forma, dariam sentido (especificidade) à palavra.\n\nNum primeiro nível o que constatamos é, por isso, uma aparente dissolução da palavra, uma redução da sua repercussão. Uma utilização que dissolve, ou desgasta, o seu fundo de verdade na esfera pública. Esta dissolução é aqui entendida próxima de uma ideia de diluição e corrosão. No entanto, as palavras não desaparecem. Pelo contrário, mantêm-se e atualizam-se. A dissolução destas palavras no domínio público recobre algo mais objetivo. Ainda que estas palavras acabem por ser descaracterizadas, na realidade, o que se verifica é uma multiplicação dos significados nelas contidos.\n\nPalavras como “*media*” ou “*fascismo*” passam a comportar um maior número de possibilidades e significados. Ou antes, a utilização que delas é feita passa a atribuir-lhes uma maior capacidade significativa. Ainda que a aparência seja uma de dissolução, o que se verifica é uma multiplicação semântica. E isto é relevante porque, entre outros aspetos, significa que passa a existir uma fenda muito maior a partir da qual se abre espaço para um abismo comunicativo, onde dois ou mais locutores se podem referir a vários significados distintos, comportados pela mesma palavra. No decorrer da pandemia, “negacionista” começou por substituir “aqueles que discordam ou contestam a gravidade da doença da Covid-19”. Devido à utilização que foi sendo feita desta palavra acima de tudo por mecanismos de distribuição de informação, “negacionista” passou também a substituir “aqueles que contestam ou questionam medidas de segurança e contenção epidemiológica”, “os que recusam a vacina”, “os que se manifestam contra medidas de confinamento” ou “os que negam a existência da doença Covid-19”. Todos estes significados são distintos e todos eles contribuem para uma multiplicação do significado fundamental de “a entidade que nega factos considerados verdadeiros”. Uma extensa multiplicação semântica a este nível revela que casos como estes não estão relacionados com uma subjetividade individual, mas com um problema de concordância e de indeterminação epistémica. Esta utilização extrema a posição de dois ou mais locutores, indetermina o referente da palavra “negacionista” e aprofunda um abismo comunicacional entre os locutores que a aplicam.\n\nÉ graças às práticas de descontextualização de informação, da deturpação ou eliminação de um contexto específico, que se viabiliza um problema de imprecisão e indeterminação linguística no regime de pós-verdade. Se não existe uma necessidade de clarificar e contextualizar ao que nos estamos a referir, a nossa utilização de determinada palavra pode ser muito mais abrangente.\n\nIsto acaba por ter consequências importantes. Palavras são redutos de intenções e significados. A incorporação de um conjunto de palavras no nosso léxico constitui a aquisição de um vocabulário. Um conjunto de palavras ou vocabulário constitui um sistema de conhecimento. Por sua vez, uma aquisição de um vocabulário é uma interiorização, absorção e adoção de um sistema de conhecimento (Godelier, 2020). Se aprender a falar implica aprender a pensar e a viver, da mesma forma, uma apropriação linguística é uma apropriação de um modelo comunicativo específico e subjetivo e, por isso mesmo, de uma forma de pensar (Ibid).\n\nSublinhamos a adoção desta nova utilização linguística como a adoção de um sistema de conhecimento. A incorporação deste tipo de linguagem num determinado vocabulário não é inócua. Pelo contrário, esta linguagem retém e transfere para o seu interlocutor e para as suas práticas discursivas, o seu caráter generalista, não-particular, não-específico. As palavras que utilizamos condicionam o entendimento que fazemos da informação subsequente que nos chega, e condicionam as possíveis leituras e reconfigurações que a partir delas conseguimos, ou não, fazer. De forma simples, a utilização deste tipo de linguagem condiciona, no sentido em que limita, uma expressão verbal e um modo de pensar.\n\nComo referimos, a apropriação de um determinado vocabulário ou sistema de conhecimento, implica uma apropriação de uma forma de pensar. Consideremos a sequência: (i) assimilamos os dados fenomenológicos com que nos confrontamos; (ii) convertemos esses dados em informação; (iii) lemos e interpretamos essa informação; (iv) atribuímos significado a essa informação; (v) exteriorizamos informação através da discursividade; (vi) convertemos discurso, através do outro, em nova informação; (vii) assimilamos nova informação. Ao \"implementarmos\" um vocabulário simplificado, a exteriorização de uma expressão verbal constituída por este vocabulário, irá por sua vez informar e atualizar o sistema biológico de processamento de informação, que é o locutor.\n\nGraças ao trabalho de Thomas Metzinger sabemos, ou é pelo menos altamente provável, que o “*self-model*” do sujeito cognitivo consciente é uma ferramenta usada por sistema de processamento de informação, por cada sujeito, de forma a tornar um certo tipo de informação cognitivamente disponível ou acessível (2004:403). “Once a transparent self-model of a being a volitional subject and a bodily agent is in place, new information becomes globally available. In particular, information becomes *cognitively* available.”(2004: 409, 410). Para além de ser um sistema biológico de processamento de informação, definição que deve ser sublinhada, para Metzinger, fundamental à condição de sujeito cognitivo é também a relação episódica *sujeito-objeto* (2004: 411). Todo o sujeito cognitivamente consciente encontra-se sempre em relação com determinado objeto ou sujeito, em cada determinada instância. Tal como o autor refere, uma perceção cognitiva consciente não existe em vácuo. Pelo contrário, depende do seu contexto e ambiente. Para Metzinger isto significa que perceção e ação não são níveis separados. “We are simultaneously perceiving *and* acting subjects” (2004: 409). Para além disto, inerente à condição de sujeito cognitivo consciente tem de existir uma relação dinâmica e, de certo modo, recíproca com esse mesmo contexto. “Full-blown conscious experience is more than the existence of a conscious self, and it is much more than the mere presence of a world. It results from the dynamic interplay between this self and the world, in a lived, embodied present.” (2004: 417). O sujeito cognitivo, ou o sistema biológico de processamento de informação, existe dependente e inerentemente informado pelo seu mundo e pela sua realidade particular, com as quais contacta e se atualiza reciprocamente.\n\nA partir daqui parece ser possível afirmar que a utilização de um determinado sistema linguístico específico pode condicionar uma forma de cognição. Este condicionamento pode ser mais ou menos evidente, mas se a linguagem da qual fazemos uso é simples e limitada, tal parece sugerir que a nossa leitura e interpretação do mundo será também ela reduzida e simplificada. A apreensão fenomenológica do que nos é exterior acaba por ficar reduzida, tendo em conta a linguagem simplificada que temos ao nosso dispor para traduzir os estímulos exteriores, fenomenologicamente apreendidos, para o próprio sistema biológico. Ou seja, este novo regime linguístico é muito mais do que a mera introdução de determinadas palavras na esfera social. É, também, a disseminação de sistemas de conhecimento, que contêm em si a possibilidade de afetar uma leitura fenomenológica do real.\n\nA introdução deste regime linguístico, que pode ser visto como uma porta de entrada para uma perceção cognitiva atualizada, gera uma pergunta: é este novo regime linguístico um prenúncio de um novo conjunto de prioridades, ou condiciona ele esse conjunto de prioridades? Se uma outra forma de comunicação é introduzida no espaço social, caracterizada por uma nova lógica comunicativa, predisposta a uma maior indeterminação e pluralidade semântica, que necessidades é que esta nova forma comunicativa vem satisfazer? Ou seja, vem este domínio linguístico colmatar uma qualquer necessidade que já se encontrava presente, ou é a ideia de “um novo conjunto de prioridades”, justamente condicionada e motivada pela emergência desta forma comunicativa? É tornada visível por ela, ou é um resultado direto dela?\n\nSegundo Saul Kripke, a descrição de um nome não nos dá o significado, nem confere um sinónimo, desse nome (2018: 60). Uma descrição apenas fixa o referente deste nome. Por sua vez, é como identificamos e definimos um objeto, fenomenologicamente, que fixa o seu referente.\n\nEm *Naming and Necessity* um dos pontos que se destaca é a relevância dada à cadeia de comunicação inerente ao processo de nomear. Para Kripke a cadeia de comunicação real pela qual determinado nome próprio nos chega, de sujeito para sujeito, é mais importante do que a forma como determinado locutor determina o referente, ou se o referente deste nome está exatamente e claramente identificado (Kripke, 1981: 91, 92, 95). É na constituição de uma cadeia comunicacional que se formula o conteúdo do nome para o “locutor”, para aquele que o verbaliza, e para a “comunidade”. É “em virtude da nossa conceção com outros oradores na comunidade”, através do seu uso repetido, que conferimos significado a determinado termo, e acabamos por consolidar determinado significado.\n\nMuitas das palavras que apontámos – verdade, ideologia, media – operam enquanto *cluster concepts,* o que apresenta uma dificuldade. Para nos podermos desemaranhar deste problema não nos devemos fixar no *verdadeiro* referente de determinada palavra, qualquer que ele seja, mas sim no processo ativo de ressignificação que sustenta a existência e visibilidade de determinada palavra. Isto, por sua vez, coloca outro obstáculo: como é que sabemos do que é que estamos a falar se a palavra está permanentemente suscetível de uma contínua ressignificação? Uma possível solução passa por uma implementação de práticas de contextualização. É por isto mesmo que se torna relevante falarmos de cadeias de comunicação. É na aparência e na confirmação da aparência de determinada palavra no seio de um determinado grupo que se confirma a coincidência de um conjunto de características fenomenológicas, que são depois depuradas e perpetuadas pelos elementos desse grupo (Kripke, 2018: 131, 135). É através desta cadeia histórica causal, e pelo elo por ela criado, que clarificamos e que tornamos possível uma contextualização semântica e discursiva.\n\nNeste processo da multiplicação semântica existem possibilidades e existem riscos. Se depositamos uma subjetividade cada vez maior nas palavras, tal como aqui sugerimos, confrontamo-nos com possíveis obstáculos. Em primeiro lugar defrontamo-nos com o risco de uma maior indeterminação epistémica, ou seja, com a dificuldade de perceber a que referente, informação ou objeto determinado significante se reporta especificamente. Por outro lado, uma multiplicação semântica dá aso a uma maior entropia que, por sua vez, contribui para uma maior dispersão e desorganização linguística. Mais dados, mais desordem e consequentemente uma maior dificuldade em discernir e selecionar a partir de um espaço assoberbado pela falta de significado. Por último, esta dispersão possibilita um desalinhamento entre locutores, ou o que apelidámos de abismo comunicativo. Ao comportarem cada vez mais significados, geram-se oportunidades para que dois ou mais locutores apliquem palavras para as quais cada locutor associa um referente, ou entendimento distinto.\n\nDito isto, esta alteração não tem de ser necessariamente negativa. Ainda que se deva a muito mais do que isto, a dificuldade que temos em cooperar coletivamente para lá dos nossos grupos mais imediatos deve-se a um *des*entendimento sobre as mesmas conceções ou palavras, a uma indefinição e indeterminação epistémica que contribui depois para uma fragmentação de práticas e de conhecimentos. Se o formato discursivo atual não satisfaz as necessidades de determinados grupos, faz sentido que possamos adotar outras linguagens mais eficazes. Se a informação e as práticas de conhecimento são formas importantes de organizar o mundo (Wark, 2016: 148), será fundamental que adotemos as linguagens mais adequadas para cada contexto e necessidades específicas. Desta forma, o que se manifesta através do que aqui apelidamos de “multiplicação semântica” pode ser um processo de uma adaptação de uma insuficiência numa possível satisfação de novas prioridades comunicativas.\n\nO sistema linguístico que se tem vindo a desenvolver no regime do pós-verdade, pode ser apenas uma continuação, uma atualização, frequentemente impercetível, dos nossos discursos – uma prática discursiva e textual atualizada. Neste momento, este sistema parece gerar alguns problemas. Mas não poderá ser ele uma reação necessária às incapacidades das nossas capacidades de comunicação antes dela, dentro e fora do espaço digital? Se estas não são eficazes, funcionais e adequadas a quaisquer que possam a ser as nossas necessidades, não fará sentido melhorá-las?\n\n## Práticas de Produção de Conhecimento\n\nDiferentes modos de organização e sociabilidade acabam por estar associados a modelos económicos distintos. As diferentes eras pré-históricas, feudais, industriais e capitalistas assim o confirmam. Em “Tribes, Institutions, Markets, Networks: A Framework about Societal Evolution” (1996) David Ronfeldt define quatro modos de organização essenciais:  Tribos, caracterizadas por sistemas de linhagem ou parentesco; instituições hierárquicas, caracterizadas por uma centralização de poder assente em cadeias de autoridade; mercados assentes em trocas competitivas abertas a iniciativas privadas; e redes, que se organizam heterarquicamente, de modo descentralizado, e que são, segundo Ronfeldt, multiorganizacionais. Como Kei Kreutler (2021) concluiu a partir do artigo de Ronfeldt, a promessa de novas formas de organização social e económica que vemos hoje surgir, correlaciona-se com o desenvolvimento das tecnologias de informação, com o surgimento da internet e, adicionaríamos nós, com a financeirização do espaço digital.\n\nDesta perspetiva faz sentido que este seja um momento de rutura. O domínio capitalista, o prolongado *realismo capitalista*, é por excelência o domínio da acumulação e centralização de capitais. Ao falar de uma “promessa de novas formas de organização”, Kei Kreutler refere-se especificamente ao modelo económico e, consequentemente, aos modos de sociabilidade viabilizados a partir da *blockchain*. A introdução deste modelo assente num sistema de transação descentralizado, contesta esse aparente realismo e parece sugerir, no mínimo, uma outra possibilidade de transação económica. Ao operar de forma descentralizada, o que neste caso específico significa que as transações económicas são confirmadas, asseguradas e protegidas por ação de outros utilizadores e não por instituições bancárias, a *blockchain* tem oferecido uma possível alternativa relativamente à transação de *tokens*, ainda que, simultaneamente, retenha e exacerbe muitos outros problemas. O que aqui se torna importante referir, é que ao operarem de forma descentralizada, as organizações *multiorganizacionais*, ou em rede, estabelecem uma dinâmica heterárquica, ou seja, uma organização que rejeita uma hierarquia e assenta numa colaboração flexível entre membros autónomos, que ainda assim podem conciliar objetivos de modo interdependente (Ronfeldt, 1996; Kreutler, 2021). Esta viragem, este redirecionar da engrenagem sugere, e último caso possibilita, uma reconfiguração dos modos de organização social e o que estes condicionam. Poderá ser argumentado que não é uma solução viável a longo-prazo. Talvez. O que é verdade é que o aparecimento da *blockchain* em conjunto com a emergência de novas dinâmicas e organizações sociais, de novos aparatos tecnológicos, com a degradação e reconfiguração da organização laboral, e com a insuficiência partidária política, anuncia inevitavelmente novas prioridades e necessidades a nível social.\n\nSe adotarmos esta perspetiva, as recentes atualizações dos modos de produção, distribuição e consumo de informação e a dificuldade de saber como nos devemos dirigir ao conhecimento –  se o devemos distribuir profusamente, se o devemos limitar (se sim em que cenários e segundo que critérios), se devemos adotar medidas ou mecanismos de proteção ainda mais ativos – podem ser vistas como  resultado ou consequência da transformação ao nível da organização social (institucional, coletiva, global) a que estamos a ser sujeitos, e da qual fazemos parte. Acima de tudo porque os modos de distribuição de informação, as nossas práticas discursivas e o conteúdo da nossa comunicação interpessoal existem sempre em relação às práticas de produção de conhecimento, às ideologias que condicionam uma existência “tecno-social” (Wark, 2016) e “tecno-linguística” (Berardi, 2019), e aos dispositivos e mecanismos tecnológicos que dão forma à nossa realidade e contribuem para a constituição de *worldviews*, epistemologias e cosmologias concretas (que, por sua vez, regem vocabulários, dinâmicas de intersubjetividade e regulamentações do real) (Gardels, 2021). A produção de conhecimento não surge de forma neutra e imaculada, mas é em cada momento condicionada e influenciada, quer na sua forma quer no seu conteúdo, pelo contexto que a constrói.\n\nÉ talvez por estarmos numa fase de transição de modelos económicos ou de modos de organização – de uma centralização em direção a uma descentralização (de recursos, atenção, informação) ou de uma hierarquização para uma multiorganização – que surge a dificuldade de como  devemos distribuir informação. Como a devemos distribuir, em primeiro lugar, para cada grupo e contexto, como é que a devemos distribuir da forma mais relevante e incorrendo no menor número de perigos possíveis (Metzinger, 2021), como é que devemos preservar e organizar a produção de conhecimento, e que vocabulários e linguagens é que devemos implementar ou disponibilizar em cada contexto. A problemática introduzida da dissolução da palavra e da multiplicação semântica faz parte de uma problemática linguística e comunicacional, mas reporta-se acima de tudo à dificuldade de *organizar* o mundo (Wark, 2016), de organizar conhecimento e de clarificar a forma como comunicamos.\n\nComo sabemos, os métodos de organização social não definem apenas as dinâmicas internas de cada grupo a nível interpessoal, mas as suas práticas constituintes, nomeadamente, práticas de produção de conhecimento. O espaço ocidental democrático existe sobre uma *aparência* de acesso universal ao conhecimento, sobre a qual, pode até ser argumentado, foi construída uma certa identificação. Ainda que seja evidente, fará sentido destacar, por um lado, que a distribuição de conhecimento é distinta da distribuição de informação, e por outro, que sempre existiram mecanismos de proteção de conhecimento.\n\nVários autores têm alertado para possíveis perigos associados à disseminação desregulada de informação e conhecimento. Não apenas o facto de em determinados casos ser *benéfico* para nós, enquanto coletivo, promover ignorância, mas também o facto de, frequentemente, mais conhecimento tornar as coisas piores (Bostrom, 2011: 30). Segundo Nick Bostrom, um compromisso com uma produção de conhecimento ilimitada e desregulada acarreta custos, riscos e perigos. “It is said that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. It is an open question whether more knowledge is safer. Even if our best bet that more knowledge is on average good, we should recognize that here numerous cases in which more knowledge makes things worse.” (2011: 30). É importante mantermos em mente que pode ser a própria busca por uma maior clarificação epistémica, e por mais conhecimento no geral, que nos pode colocar em perigo, ou que pode ser ela própria danosa (Metzinger, 2021: 46, 48).\n\nBostrom não está sozinho. Em entrevista à *Kunstkritik,* McKenzie Wark diz-nos: “As a pedagogy, the Enlightenment project was about increasing the availability of information, to let rational people know and decide to end censorship and mystification. It now turns out the Enlightenment project to get knowledge to propagate produces so much noise that you now have to create less visibility. The problem now is to make most information go away.” (Dunker, 2021).\n\nDeparamo-nos com o problema de perder informação, de fornecer informação que nos pode pôr em risco, ou com a expropriação e exploração de informação. É por este motivo que para Wark a ideia de *assimetria de informação* se torna importante. Uma assimetria de informação acontece quando existe um desequilíbrio entre duas partes, no qual uma das partes controla mais informação do que a outra. Se esta dinâmica surgiu inicialmente de um enquadramento económico, esta acontece hoje predominantemente no espaço tecnológico e digital, onde se torna possível, mais facilmente, uma apropriação de informação que nos permite ela mesma controlar recursos. Ao controlar os recursos materiais e as ordens protocolares que estruturam o movimento e o acesso desses recursos, o domínio informativo passa a subsumir em si um controlo económico e financeiro. Esta é a verdadeira besta que se ergue do mar, a produção insidiosa e o controlo de informação que domina e *regula* sub-repticiamente, por mais implícito seja, a nossa realidade.\n\nEsta expropriação e assimilação de informação por grandes entidades privadas envolve-se, por meio de assimetrias de informação e outros processos mais complexos, em mecanismos de análise de *big data*, ou seja, através de uma compilação categorização e separação de grandes conjuntos de dados. Embora estes dados sejam frequentemente interpretados como elementos abstratos, passíveis de utilização por qualquer entidade, é por norma esta mesma perceção que obstrui um entendimento claro de que são os processos analíticos e operações algorítmicas *aplicadas* sobre estes mesmos dados, que guiam e condicionam a nossa atenção e perceção e, consequentemente, os resultados obtidos.\n\nComo vários autores têm referido, não é possível entender a relação estabelecida entre práticas governativas e *big data*, sem nos debruçarmos sobre as tecnologias que sustentam e produzem novas visibilidades e novos alvos de governação. “*What* problems are being made visible through big data for development depends to some degree on *how* the underlying data is visualized and *who* is captured in the visualizations. The “how” of visualization is important because choices concerning the logics of categorization beneath the visual representations are controversial.“ (Flyverbom, Madsen, & Rasche, 2017).\n\nEm processos como as assimetrias de informação, o foco dado ao reconhecimento de padrões em detrimento de *hypothesis-testing*, não só dá aso a práticas de descontextualização e desintegração de informação, como potencia o risco de produzir conhecimento que aparenta ser legítimo, quando não o é. Em 2021 a questão mantém-se: “How does the rationalization of knowledge impact the ways individuals and organizatins are made accountable for the effects of policies and governance initiatives?” (Flyverbom, Madsen, & Rasche, 2017: 16). Racionalização é aqui relevante visto nos que remete para o modo como a informação a partir da qual o conhecimento é produzido é extraída, estruturada e organizada. Racionalização salienta também que a produção de conhecimento está dependente das suas práticas. Dependente das linguagens implementadas para comunicar e materializar esse conhecimento, do modo como esse conhecimento é distribuído e partilhado, das tecnologias e ferramentas aplicadas para a produção e sistematização de conhecimento e, acima de tudo, do modo *como*, e *por quem*, essas tecnologias e ferramentas são programadas e calibradas para funcionar. A expressão operativa que as práticas de produção de conhecimento adquirem está, por isso, dependente de um conjunto de condicionantes, que são hoje predominantemente informadas pelo sistema de organização económico-financeiro vigente. Claro que o conhecimento pode ser, e é frequentemente, produzido fora deste sistema e domínio de “automatismos tecno-linguísticos” (Berardi, 2019). Mas as práticas institucionais e organizacionais de conhecimento no espaço ocidental, mantém-se dependentes desta lógica.\n\nComo temos vindo a sugerir, é justamente o elo que se efetiva entre *informação*–*tecnologia–governação* que torna possível uma *regulamentação do real*. No momento em que um destes elementos se altera ou transforma, os outros elementos ficam desfasados de uma realidade que se encontra em atualização. Desadequados às necessidades de uma realidade que, entretanto, é outra.\n\nE o que é que pode ser entendido por regulamentação do real? Uma regulamentação do real materializa-se na efetivação de processos executivos, legislativos e protocolares que são viabilizados pela informação extraída de ferramentas e aparatos tecnológicos. É através destes aparatos, que são neste momento predominantemente computacionais, e da informação deles extraídos que se torna possível condicionar um conjunto de processos legislativos e protocolares (leis, contratos, regulamentos, … ). Processos eleitorais são o exemplo paradigmático do que pode ser uma regulamentação do real, ainda que as regulamentações mais significativas sejam, por norma, mais impercetíveis. Testemunhámos isto mesmo com os eventos desencadeados pelas empresas privadas da *Cambridge Analytica* e *Aggregate IQ* em 2016, e com a influência que tiveram nas eleições americanas e no referendo do Brexit, respetivamente. Sabemos que através dos dados de utilizadores usurpados, ambas as empresas direcionaram informação específica, em grande parte falsificada e descontextualizada, através das quais os utilizadores poderiam confirmar crenças pessoais que fossem de encontro ao objetivo requerido por ambas as empresas. Casos como estes deixam evidente que a informação que é controlada e detida contém a possibilidade de reger não apenas processos legislativos, mas a informação que gere a própria informação (Wark, 2019). Passa a ser a informação burocrática e contratual que rege recursos naturais, minerais, humanos e mercadorias. Desta forma, a regulamentação do real acontece ou torna-se possível, quando uma entidade assegura informação que permite influenciar mecanismos constituintes das esferas de governação política, económica ou social.\n\nPor ser resultado de uma interconexão e interação de vários mecanismos, esta regulamentação nem sempre é óbvia ou explícita. Ademais, importa referir que esta regulamentação, esta aplicação de condicionantes e regulamentos não é inerentemente nociva ou, apenas por si só, um policiamento, ainda que contenha em si a possibilidade de o ser. Como frequentemente acontece, uma biblioteca pode, por exemplo, limitar ou condicionar o acesso a obras raras, fisicamente sensíveis ou já danificadas a um determinado grupo de entidades, por norma, investigadores especializados. Esta medida é colocada em vigor de modo a preservar as obras e, consequentemente, de forma a preservar fontes de conhecimento. Através desta medida protocolar são constituídas realidades nas quais, caso não sejamos investigadores especializados, não temos acesso a um determinado conjunto de conhecimentos. No entanto, se for implementado um regulamento que, sob o pretexto da preservação de conhecimento, restrinja ou impeça, por exemplo, o estudo ou o acesso a documentos históricos que comprovem e documentem longas práticas de discriminação social ou racial dentro de um determinado país, de modo que uma inacessibilidade desses documentos contribua para uma continuação, ou até aumento, da discriminação social e violação de direitos humanos dentro desse país, estamos perante um processo de regulamentação do real que contribui para a promoção de discriminação social, ignorância epistémica e desconhecimento histórico.\n\nO que aqui se torna importante sublinhar é que a palavra detém um papel fundamental no processo de regulamentação do real. Por isso mesmo, as discursividades que aplicamos, e que dentro do domínio digital podem ser posteriormente apropriadas de forma a tentar produzir conhecimento, não são apenas palavras. São construções ativas que se concentram em depósitos de possibilidade para regulamentar o real.\n\nAs práticas de produção de conhecimento, os processos de transmissão de informação e os processos de assimilação e exploração de informação (como as assimetrias de informação), coincidem num ponto comum. Todos estes procuram produzir instâncias de verdade. Ou pelo menos facilitar a sua identificação. Se estamos a testemunhar uma atualização linguística e se existem categorias epistemológicas que estão a deixar de fazer sentido no regime do pós-verdade, talvez a nossa relação com a verdade tenha de ser outra.\n\nA identificação destas questões leva Anna Lorusso a sugerir mudar o foco da categoria de verdade para a categoria de legitimidade. Enquanto o conceito de verdade tem um caráter universalista – o que é verdade é sempre verdade, independentemente de espaço, tempo ou locutor – o conceito de legitimidade depende (i) da referência a um contexto específico, de um (ii) reconhecimento social, e (iii) de uma dimensão processual. Legitimidade foca-se em componentes de adequação e justificação, e depende de uma conformidade com um conjunto de normas culturais e regras legislativas. A partir do domínio da legitimidade são estabelecidos um conjunto de limites, passíveis de atualização e revisão, que facilitam a organização e clarificação de processos comunicativos e práticas de conhecimento. “Any rule is historical and, therefore, subject to change, but until it is valid, it defines certain boundaries, and what transgresses these boundaries is illegitimate.” (Lorusso, 2020). Segundo a autora, ao contrário de um julgamento de verdade que estipula uma dinâmica de correspondência que está hoje desadequada, julgamentos de legitimidade relacionam uma declaração com uma rede de regras intersubjetivas fornecidas por um sistema socialmente reconhecido. Considerarmos a legitimidade de uma declaração implica, segundo esta perspetiva, relacionar esta declaração com uma rede de outras declarações que a tornam aceitável, ou não.\n\nA grande vantagem da perspetiva de Lorusso reside no ênfase que é dado à necessidade de estabelecer uma regulamentação que não incorra em censura, e à relevância dada a atos de reconhecimento, de interpretação, de conformidade e de uma constituição de relações em redes que permitam múltiplas verificações. “Competences of speakers, adequacy of statements to the whole cultural system, and pragmatic and systematic effects are, in some cases, our guardrail, the limits to interpretative freedom. If the judgement of legitimacy implies an interpretative work, this interpretative work is not entirely unbridled. It does not have the guarantee of a strong, abstract criterion of truth; it cannot consist of an automatic and objective verification, but has the limits of a reasonable work of interpretation. “ (Lorusso, 2020: 1016).\n\nAqui coincidem a demarcação de um sistema em rede, no qual existe a possibilidade de exercitar julgamentos de legitimidade e de inquirir sobre a validade destes mesmos julgamentos, através de um exercício de poder *adequado* e *correspondente* a um reconhecimento coletivo, que existe contida num sistema de verificação contextual, plural e passível de revisão. Todos estes aspetos contribuem para a sistematização do que pode ser considerado um conjunto de *práticas de contextualização*.\n\nA contribuição de Anna Lorusso incide sobre uma questão maior. Através de uma reformulação do vocabulário, é avançada uma alteração que promove práticas de contextualização, a partir das quais se torna possível reconfigurar um enquadramento epistemológico. É possível afirmar que privilegiar práticas de contextualização pressupõem uma redução da informação global, dado que informação que é contextualizada gera menos entropia ao relacionar-se com uma rede referencial? Será possível afirmar que privilegiar práticas de contextualização contribuem para uma clarificação comunicativa?\n\nTodos os apelos que temos vindo a assistir relativos à atualização de vocabulários, ao abandono de linguagens obsoletas que não nos devem acompanhar para o futuro, e a insistência nas ideias de *validade*, *pertinência*, *apropriação* e *legitimidade*, (Bratton, 2021: 45, 50) reconhecem que os regulamentos, protocolos ou quaisquer outros mecanismos a aplicar devem responder, em primeiro lugar, a enquadramentos contextuais específicos. Apropriado e legítimo, *para quem*?\n\nNo início deste segmento referimos que a organização social subjacente a um determinado corpo coletivo é determinante para a forma e conteúdo do conhecimento que é produzido. Ideias como o *Horizonte de possibilidade* de que Franco Berardi (2019) fala, ou as *biopolíticas positivas* de Benjamin Bratton (2021), surgem de um reconhecimento das insuficiências das presentes organizações sociais. Insuficiências que são reconvertidas em depósitos de possibilidade, a partir das quais se procura convocar práticas e relações compostas e multifacetadas.\n\nA introdução do conceito de “biopolíticas positivas”, tal como a legitimidade referida por Lorusso, são sintomáticas de uma sensibilidade que entende que o foco deve estar na *nuance* das metodologias aplicadas. Tal como muitos oradores do Ciclo, Lorusso e Bratton entendem a importância de falar a linguagem dos nossos tempos. Dicotomias simplificadas como vigilância *versus* anti-vigilância, como Bratton refere – e às quais poderíamos adicionar corrupção *versus* anti-corrupção ou verdade *versus* mentira – não suficientes para pensar de forma sustentável o futuro e devem ser substituídas por “vocabulários policromáticos”. Ou seja, talvez devam ser pensados enquanto poliedros, e não enquanto binómios. As contribuições de Foucault ou Shoshana Zuboff são inegavelmente úteis. Mas isto não significa que estejam livres de qualquer reformulação ou atualização, ou que sejam intrinsecamente suficientes. Do mesmo modo que uma regulamentação do real pode e deve ser utilizada para um desenvolvimento social alargado e para uma melhoria das nossas condições laborais, habitacionais e comunitárias, também formas de modelação, observação e deteção social (o que Bratton apelida de *social sensing*) podem contribuir para um maior desenvolvimento e entendimento coletivo (Bratton, 2021: 45). Repetimos: estas práticas não são intrinsecamente negativas. É o modo como são aplicadas que o determina. E é para estas metodologias que devemos também dirigir a nossa atenção.\n\nNa ideia de regulamentação do real converge a palavra, um determinado núcleo social e a produção de conhecimento. Como a palavra é aplicada condiciona uma aplicação social da mesma, e os atos de regulamentação do real que são informados pela produção de conhecimento que, de alguma forma, incorpora essa(s) palavra(s). Da palavra, ao aparato que captura a palavra, passando pela constituição do conhecimento, até ao corpo social.\n\nA dissolução da palavra e a regulamentação do real podem ser encarados como problemas de organização. Como organizamos informação, como organizamos e implementamos aparatos tecnológicos, como organizamos conhecimento. Falar de práticas de produção de conhecimento implica falar de organizações sociais e do(s) modelo(s) de regulamentação do real que possibilitam essas organizações, e por sua vez, essas ou outras práticas de produção de conhecimento. Considerar e incidir na ideia de práticas de contextualização é insistir na possibilidade de organizar e sistematizar de outra forma. Na possibilidade de atualizar modelos comunicativos, aproximando-os das necessidades que se mantêm por cumprir.\n\n## Depois do Fim da Verdade Objetiva\n\nO Fim da Verdade Objetiva foi convocado para questionar segundo que modelos nos regemos daqui para a frente. Depois do fim da verdade objetiva, olhamos para o abismo e o abismo olha de volta para nós sem grandes respostas.\n\nSabemos pelo menos, ou é-nos sugerido, que existem tipos de organizações que se começam a estruturar segundo dinâmicas diferentes. Organizações económicas, sociais e informacionais. Aqui destacámos a ideia de dissolução enquanto multiplicação semântica (que foi pensada relativa a um regime linguístico, mas que se pode estender até sistemas de regulamentação ou organização). É no centro do domínio informativo e nas práticas dos mecanismos de transmissão de informação que testemunhamos uma das mais importantes reestruturações. Motivo pelo qual procurámos destacar as práticas degeneração e descontextualização informativa, que acabam por informar ou pelo menos estar correlacionas com práticas de regulamentação do real. É talvez, por um lado, o fim do entendimento unívoco no que toca a certas epistemologias, e por outro, a emergência de outras, que continuamos sem saber como serão implementadas ou organizadas.\n\nMuitos dos nossos problemas advêm ainda de não conseguir descortinar a névoa que separa o domínio da representação e o domínio da realidade.  Se são as práticas de produção de conhecimento que nos permitem aproximar de uma progressiva solução ou clarificação entre esses dois domínios, é importante saber que práticas efetivam esse mesmo conhecimento. Falar de verdade é uma armadilha. Mas falar de legitimidade e validade leva-nos a considerar formas de conhecimento, práticas de conhecimento, práticas de contextualização de informação e cadeias comunicacionais. Uma atualização do nosso vocabulário, ainda que uma pequena como esta, possibilita uma configuração do modo como consideramos a ideia de verdade ou, mais importante, o que pode ocupar o lugar de veracidade. Quando aqui convocámos mecanismos de distribuição de informação, práticas de produção de conhecimento, práticas discursivas e práticas de contextualização, procurámos sublinhar o modo como categorias epistemológicas e agentes e contextos específicos se “co-produzem in actu” (Kleeberg, 2020).\n\nPor último, há um aspeto a reconhecer. A incidência neste conjunto específico de palavras – descentralização, regulamentação, dissolução, contrato, protocolo, etc – é contextual e muito provavelmente não irá resistir à passagem do tempo. Em muitos aspetos, estas não são as palavras corretas e esta não é a linguagem adequada. Mas nelas concentra-se o desejo de comunicar com outras palavras, com outros léxicos, de conceber conhecimento de outra forma ou, no mínimo, de concentrar atenção nos enquadramentos e limitações no qual este é concebido.\n\nDepois do fim da verdade objetiva, abre-se espaço para conceber outros regulamentos, outros modos de organização e outras formas de comunicação. Estas propostas e modelos têm de ser avançados o mais rápido possível, antes que o horizonte de possibilidade se evapore.", "timestamp": 1635086330, "digest": "1XyulG1i67pVVABAUnCe_zuBYW3z4mMTHN4QWLOo97w", "contributor": "0x91e0358706143e3944aF5c0bd43f426f61dc0a2e"}

{"id": "PNyaajHessk-lePhSrcE-n1e7_btkYJP4SgSIwZD2nc", "title": "Democratization and Communitization of Finance", "body": "Due to low interest rates and global growth rates, economic inequality is intensifying worldwide. In particular, during COVID-19 crisis, the gap between the rich and poor keeps widening.\n\nThere is a phenomenon in which the rich become richer and the poor become poorer. Growing young generations are investing in stocks and real estate and go so far as to invest with debt leveraging. Many people say “If I had bought a house at that time”, “If I had bought stocks at that time”, or “If I had bought Bitcoin at that time”. It happens today that some people either get rich or poor overnight.\n\n## Democratization of Finance\n\nRecently announced housing price in Seoul, South Korea is about $1M. Everyone is getting into an investment, realizing that they can't buy a house only with their wages. Fortunately, in these days, there are various platforms such as YouTube, Podcasts, and Blogs where you can learn financial information and economics.\n\nFinancial services for retail investors such as Robin Hood, Ministock, and Toss have lowered entries to the market. The financial market which used to only allow Wall Street, investment banks, venture capital, and hedge funds to be entered is now open to people thanks to these services.\n\nFurthermore, a platform has emerged where groups of people agreeing to the vision and direction of unlisted companies can participate in fundraising instead of just acquiring stocks in the secondary market.\n\nAngel League, one of the services in Korea allows people to purchase the private equity of a startup as a union member. Over the past year, the average return of Angel League reached 107%, outperforming unicorn startups such as Yanolja, Kurly, Krafton, and Toss.\n\nTwig, the private equity investment platform provided the users with an opportunity to invest in global startups such as Robin Hood and Kraken.\n\nMore services linking stocks to digital assets have also been created. FTX, a global cryptocurrency exchange, launched a product which is linked to the value of stocks such as Tesla, Apple, and Google that can be purchased with cryptocurrency.\n\nThe stablecoin platform Terra built a platform for trading and issuing synthetic assets based on the value of the real stock on the blockchain. And it is free from regulatory censorship by the countries and institutions.\n\nUnlike the existing traditional financial market, individuals are given more authority to manage various assets in the cryptocurrency market. Many platforms are coming with interest rates higher than the commercial banks and that can make people get the short or long position through low collateral ratio with crypto. Also, there is a platform that allows anyone to make their own portfolio to create index funds in crypto.\\*\\* \\\\n \\*\\*\n\nIn the future, various open financial services can emerge from cryptocurrency. This will be able to give more authority and opportunities for retail investors. **So It is time to readjust the \"Uneven playground\" in the existing financial industry, which was only advantageous for institutional investors and traditional large banks.**\n\n## Communitization of Finance\n\nWith the development of the Internet, now anyone can get information for investment and the asymmetry of information has been resolved. Retail investors are starting to create an investment community and exchange information with each other. **The community formed in this way has strong power.**\n\nInvestors in the community begin to pay attention to new assets in Long-tail, not traditional assets.\n\nAn example is the GameStop in January. There was an incident in which individual investors in the Wall Street Bet(WSB) were angry at institutions' short positions. They responded strategically and systematically causing a short squeeze.\n\nThe epicenter of this incident was WSB, one of the communities in Reddit. The Reddit community, along with Twitter, began to create the WSB's meme culture and as people were forwarding and sharing it. More people became interested in this incident and participated in the community.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bZIaZKPKU01XVj3EBlk6J.png?height=732&width=692)\n\nThe same thing happened with Dogecoin. Led by Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, WSB, and people on Twitter were shouting out support for Dogecoin and made a huge impact. Through the meme culture and SNS, Dogecoin has gained big attention in the community.\n\nThese phenomena were started and led by the MZ generation who consists most of WSB and Twitter users. They led this meme culture. MZ can come up with great memes and use them as a means of online communication. **The community has created a kind of culture by using memes and begun to make new trends.**\n\n**New added value can be formed if people start to get interest in certain assets and drive the trend.** The community creates its own consensus mechanism and the people who belong to the community can form a fellowship and sense of unity.\n\nThis is similar to the dollars printed by the U.S. Federal Bank. Because the value of the dollar is also created by the consensus and belief of a specific community. (Agreement of all global countries in the case of dollars).\n\nThe dollar's hegemony has been maintained for about 80 years since the Bretton Woods in 1944, but its power is gradually weakening. Since 2008, quantitative easing has been implemented. In Particular, dollars have been distributed indefinitely since the start of Covid-19.\n\nAs the value of the dollar weakens, doubts about the dollar and fiat increased and interest in new assets is growing.\n\nSo are Bitcoin, luxury brands, and NFT (Non Fungible tokens). More people consider Bitcoin as digital gold and communities for Bitcoin are growing, the value of Bitcoin is formed.\n\nSimilarly, luxury brands have their own philosophy and fandom that loves their products. Luxury goods have an irreplaceable value that is only for luxury brands and cannot be given by ordinary products. People having luxury goods differentiate themselves from others and show off their wealth by purchasing luxury goods.\n\nLike luxury goods, the value of NFT can increase when communities and fandom who love NFT are growing. And so are people who recognize expensive and scarce NFT.\n\nFurthermore, communities can create values for 'specific people' beyond specific assets. People who are supported by the community such as celebrities, YouTubers, and influencers, can create new added value. They will be able to interact with the community by communicating with fans through their own tokens (personal tokens).\n\n## The Value of the Community and Money\n\nRecently, ‘Dangguen Market’, an online secondhand marketplace in Korea, raised the investment with a valuation of $2.7B from Soft Bank Ventures Asia, Altos Ventures, Kakao Ventures. This valuation is higher than that of Shinsegae Group, a major domestic retailer in Korea. If Dangguen Market simply focused on the secondary market, this valuation would not make sense.\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/south-korean-online-secondhand-marketplace-danggeun-market-raises-162m-at-a-2-7b-valuation/](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/south-korean-online-secondhand-marketplace-danggeun-market-raises-162m-at-a-2-7b-valuation/)\n\nIn fact, the strength of the Dangguen Market is in the **‘local community’** rather than its core function of being a secondary market. Dangguen Market forms a local community for users in a specific area and provides various information such as local restaurants, cafes as well as trading second-hand stuff. Dangguen Market is creating value through the local community.\n\n**The value and power of the community are really strong.** The value created by the ‘Bottom-Up’ method from the community is gradually causing social changes through various experiments.\n\nCommunity elements can’t be excluded when valuing a specific asset or company in the future. Even with the era of the digital world and the digital assets, the value of communities people form will become more important. **Eventually, communities will become power and money.**\n\n> ***[DeSpread](https://www.despread.io/) —*** *[Website](https://www.despread.io/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DeSpreadTeam) | [Telegram](https://t.me/despread) | [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DeSpreadCreative)*\n>\n> *DeSpread is a multi-chain ecosystem builders founded by blockchain contents creator to help projects to accelerate together with the sustainable ecosystem.

{"id": "J9crODqUh__UmbQJKc7WVK9aH_ITQl0ABUV-lzRh6OM", "title": "Failing to Appreciate a Thing on it's Own Terms", "body": "## Bob Dylan - Self Titled\n\nWhen I decided to pursue Sonic Odyssey, the first question I had to answer was “where do I start?”  I knew I wanted to start in the 1960s, and starting in the year 1960 would allow for a complete decade in review type post somewhere down the line.  However, there wasn’t much on the release schedule for that year that I was excited to listen to.  Similarly, 1961 felt kind of barren.\n\nThe first album that jumped out for me was Bob Dylan’s self titled debut from March 1962.  Dylan, of course, is a legend, and his music is something I’ve enjoyed since I was a kid, so it it seemed fitting to start this project with him, and with an album that I’ve never listened to before.  With that decision made (and a chronological detour taken for [Nina Simone’s January 1962 release](https://mirror.xyz/0x81b48641A6a351DA1E461B9E4ca585d43dBB60E1/Duqgbm10_7hqigjtD2xsAat5XiLCfU6SByfEWOTRr1Y)), I set off on my journey.\n\nImmediately upon starting up the record, I was flooded with thoughts that took me out of the moment and made clear that my own biases and preconceptions were going to be a problem for this project.  Instead of experiencing great, new to me songs like “Talkin’ New York” and “In My Time of Dyin’” for what they were, I was comparing them to all the iconic tracks still to come in future albums.\n\nIn this context, Bob Dylan felt like a letdown, but it was only a letdown because of this context.  It’s completely impossible for the songs from this album to measure up to the fully realized, earth shattering work I know is soon to come.  I essentially spoiled myself, and let my knowledge of the story’s end disrupt my ability to appreciate the story’s beginning.\n\nSo, as I listened, I tried to reorient myself, but ended up on another distracting path when I started to think of the album as a stepping stone towards something greater for Dylan himself and popular music as a whole.  Although this line of thinking is more or less true, it’s a clinical take that runs counter to the purpose of Sonic Odyssey as a whole, which an entirely self-interested attempt for me to find new stuff to listen to on a regular playlist.\n\nUpon making that realization, I tried again to recenter myself on simply on what I was listening to, and to appreciate the album for what it is on its own terms, devoid of preconceptions, anticipation or historical calculation.  This proved to be exceedingly difficult.  I’m not entirely sure it’s possible to do so at all, honestly.  Or at least maybe it’s just not possible for me personally.  I certainly didn’t achieve it with this record.\n\nLooking back, I’m not entirely sure what to think of what I heard.  I recognize that it’s good, and that it’s important.  I also recognize that I liked it.  But, I don’t think that liking it is enough, since for the most part it didn’t evoke much of a feeling in me, and triggering emotions is really the whole point of this exercise.\n\nIn the end, I think this is going to be the kind of thing that I just move on from in favor of something else, and that it will largely fade from my memory.

{"id": "owYf9OtfvB_TRPHOjL2WwsC1ql1k8yaJToqpaOTHHLo", "title": "Is web3 wrecking your mental health? ", "body": "If you think the world is moving quickly, try web3. Crypto/NFT/DAO communities make our modern, fast-paced world feel like a tranquil existence in a mountain cabin.\n\nToday's world is toxic for people's mental health. Depression, anxiety, and many other mental health issues are skyrocketing.\n\nAnd that's \"just\" from scrolling Instagram all day, checking Slack during family dinners and getting rejected on Tinder twice a day.\n\nWeb3 is even more intense. In my experience, it doesn't replace our bad tech habits, it amplifies them.\n\n~~Go to~~ Refresh Twitter, Discord or Telegram and you see an onslaught of cartoon profile pictures celebrating:\n\n* This person's NFT project sold out in hours.\n* That person made 20k overnight flipping a gorilla drawing.\n* See her over there? She raised 20 million in a token sale after declining an acquisition offer.\n* Quick! While you weren't looking, a 20-year old artist sold an illustration for your yearly salary.\n* How did you miss that writer's piece? He gained 150k followers in a year and makes 50k per month writing his newsletter.\n\n**These stories are abundant in the web3 space.**\n\nAnd that's great. If all the utopian ideas attached to crypto are to come true, we need to work, win, get back to work and win again.\n\n![MBA textbook material.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4bzCU66Q4UTcEGvctJWNi.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nBut what if you're so anxious or depressed that you can't even get started on the \"work\" part?\n\n## The toxic pain of web3 jealousy\n\nI know I should love to see my friends win. But there's a subtle undertone of FOMO. It's a voice in my head that asks \"But what about me?\".\n\nMaybe it's self-obsession. But I think/hope it's human. \n\nThere's a gut-wrenching feeling of being a spectator, not a player in this world-changing innovation. And that feeling grows...\n\n...Whenever I pass on an NFT project and watch its value multiply.\n\n...Whenever someone I know makes and sells amazing art and builds a great community around it.\n\n...Whenever someone builds a giant audience from scratch while 15 people see my content.\n\nI hate to admit it, but there's a feeling of dwindling opportunity. A voice saying *\"If you don't make it now, you never will.”*\n\n![My goal with this.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/43v5IdWa5y0HR4Qr4oQ2U.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nThe longer you let those thoughts stew, the more it corrodes your mental health. If this keeps going, you arrive at a point where you can't even do the \"get to work\" part required for the \"winning\" part.\n\nNow, I know those thoughts are lying. It's a scarcity mindset, something telling you *\"You can't have it because they already took it…”*\n\n**There's no reason I, you or anyone else can't get 100k followers, sell out an NFT project, become a professional newsletter writer, sell a business for millions or raise a venture fund.**\n\nYou've probably read enough self-help books to understand these endless possibilities rationally. I know I have.\n\nBut maybe you're like me. Maybe you've struggled with mental health before and you're excited about web3 and the seemingly endless possibilities.\n\n**The bitter truth is:** Even if you're learning valuable things in Discord, Twitter, etc., too much exposure to it can harm your mental health.\n\nMental health is swept under the rug in web3 communities. But it shouldn’t. We’re building this new, decentralized internet together—and we need everyone to execute at their highest capacity. Mental health can sabotage that.\n\nDon’t believe me? Read on for the parallels between the impact of \"regular\" social media and web3 communities:\n\n### Why your favorite Discord is like a teenager's Instagram feed\n\nWe've all heard how Instagram impacts teenage girls:\n\nA young girl sees a supermodel living the brand-deal-sponsored dream. She won the genetic lottery, her body sculpted by years in the gym and perfected by Adobe toolbars.\n\nWhen she looks in the mirror, she only sees the contrast between herself and this illusion of perfect beauty. She feels ugly, inadequate and worthless. But ignoring Instagram means you'll miss out on fashion trends and be even uglier.\n\nThe same thing is happening in tech/web3. When other people's success confronts us with our own shortcomings, we feel inferior, perpetually behind and jealous.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uOE7yJKsWomfvPTegmcdI.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nAnd yet, leaving Twitter, Discord, etc. means you'll fall even further behind.\n\nThis paints a bleak picture, doesn't it? Luckily, it's not that bad in web3. First of all, we're (mostly) grown adults, not developing teenagers. But there's another point that's much more optimistic:\n\n### You can reach the ideals!\n\nInstagram beauty ideals are literally impossible because of filters and Photoshop.\n\nBut most web3 wins are real.\n\nIn crypto, you can trace every transaction. You can see how much an artist's piece sold for. Exits, funding rounds and follower counts are hard to fake.\n\n***Side note:*** *Factually accurate wins don't mean there aren't survivorship bias and narrative fallacy to make outcomes seem easier than they are.*\n\nNo amount of gym time or makeup lets you reach Instagram beauty standards. In tech, it’s literally a function of pressing the right keyboard buttons in the right order. Yes, you need skills and experience, but you actually could've written that code, made that drawing or sent that DM. \n\n[https://twitter.com/NikMilanovic/status/1390720487328821250?s=20](https://twitter.com/NikMilanovic/status/1390720487328821250?s=20)\n\n### Why don't you?\n\nRealizing that you could empowers you. At the same time, it confronts you with a difficult question: “*Why don't you?\"*\n\nHaving to ask this hurt. It made me regret being in Discord all day. It showed me that I was entertaining internet strangers for 17 seconds while I could've been creating long-term value. It showed me that my work simply wasn’t that good. Ouch.\n\nYour answers to *\"Why don't you?\"* might be different. But when you answer that painful question, you're on the path to winning. Because once you know what’s in your way, you can overcome it.\n\n![When the way is blocked, find a better one.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DWDE94PvIEXgh6cRMBr9u.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n#### What do you do about it?\n\nYou have to turn your insights into action. I can only share 3 steps I took. Feel free to use these as a starting point to make your own web3 habits healthier.\n\n1. **Limit your time in Discord and Twitter**\n\nWhether you want to create by writing, designing or coding, you need time to do so. If you spend every free minute in web3 communities, you'll never get to it.\n\nSpending less time on those media lowered my exposure to content that makes me feel inferior and carved out time to read, write and design.\n\n1. **Play games you can win**\n\nI've been a professional writer for 5 years. Yet I tried to \"make it\" in web3 as a designer.\n\nI hated seeing other designers/illustrators succeed while nobody cared about my visuals. That had a simple reason: Other people's visuals are better.\n\nCompeting on design with people who put decades into that craft? Impossible.\n\nWriting is a game I have better chances of winning, simply because I'm better at it. As you see, I still make visuals. Some of them are even good. But building with visuals alone means I'll lose.\n\n![\"Become the best in the world at what you do, keep redefining what you do until this is true.\" -Naval Ravikant](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/puckmsJj52PKKYVPZQUBT.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nIf you want to contribute to web3, do it with your strengths. Not with what others contribute.\n\n1. **See behind the success**\n\nYou'll see others get wealthy, popular and influential. Instead of feeling inferior, ask yourself:\n\n*\"Have I put in the work he has?\"* \n\n*\"Have I taken the risks she has?\"* \n\n*\"How long has she been doing this? How long have I been doing this?\"*\n\n![who do you compare yourself to?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0uzofDX1V0NrNTM8adOwj.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nYou don't get to compare your outcomes with someone else's if you haven't put in the same amount of work.\n\nWrapping up: Better mental health in web3\n\nIf you're reading this all the way to the closing paragraph, there's a good chance you're a web3 enthusiast who's struggling with mental health.\n\nThis article is not FUD. I believe in web3, including many notions others call utopian.\n\nBut to make those a reality, we all need to contribute. To contribute to your maximum capacity (and reap the rewards of that), you need to take care of your mental health.\n\nHopefully this article showed you some of the mechanics that make you miserable, how to fix them.\n\nMost important of all...

Crypto/NFT/DAO communities make our modern, fast-paced world feel like a tranquil existence in a mountain cabin.\n\nToday's world is toxic for people's mental health. Depression, anxiety, and many other mental health issues are skyrocketing.\n\nAnd that's \"just\" from scrolling Instagram all day, checking Slack during family dinners and getting rejected on Tinder twice a day.\n\nWeb3 is even more intense. In my experience, it doesn't replace our bad tech habits, it amplifies them.\n\n~~Go to~~ Refresh Twitter, Discord or Telegram and you see an onslaught of cartoon profile pictures celebrating:\n\n* This person's NFT project sold out in hours.\n* That person made 20k overnight flipping a gorilla drawing.\n* See her over there? She raised 20 million in a token sale after declining an acquisition offer.\n* Quick! While you weren't looking, a 20-year old artist sold an illustration for your yearly salary.\n* How did you miss that writer's piece? He gained 150k followers in a year and makes 50k per month writing his newsletter.\n\n**These stories are abundant in the web3 space.**\n\nAnd that's great. If all the utopian ideas attached to crypto are to come true, we need to work, win, get back to work and win again.\n\n![MBA textbook material.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4bzCU66Q4UTcEGvctJWNi.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nBut what if you're so anxious or depressed that you can't even get started on the \"work\" part?\n\n## The toxic pain of web3 jealousy\n\nI know I should love to see my friends win. But there's a subtle undertone of FOMO. It's a voice in my head that asks \"But what about me?\".\n\nMaybe it's self-obsession. But I think/hope it's human.\n\nThere's a gut-wrenching feeling of being a spectator, not a player in this world-changing innovation. And that feeling grows...\n\n...Whenever I pass on an NFT project and watch its value multiply.\n\n...Whenever someone I know makes and sells amazing art and builds a great community around it.\n\n...Whenever someone builds a giant audience from scratch while 15 people see my content.\n\nI hate to admit it, but there's a feeling of dwindling opportunity. A voice saying *\"If you don't make it now, you never will.”*\n\n![My goal with this.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/43v5IdWa5y0HR4Qr4oQ2U.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nThe longer you let those thoughts stew, the more it corrodes your mental health. If this keeps going, you arrive at a point where you can't even do the \"get to work\" part required for the \"winning\" part.\n\nNow, I know those thoughts are lying. It's a scarcity mindset, something telling you *\"You can't have it because they already took it…”*\n\n**There's no reason I, you or anyone else can't get 100k followers, sell out an NFT project, become a professional newsletter writer, sell a business for millions or raise a venture fund.**\n\nYou've probably read enough self-help books to understand these endless possibilities rationally. I know I have.\n\nBut maybe you're like me.

But it shouldn’t. We’re building this new, decentralized internet together—and we need everyone to execute at their highest capacity. Mental health can sabotage that.\n\nDon’t believe me?

At the same time, it confronts you with a difficult question: “*Why don't you?\"*\n\nHaving to ask this hurt. It made me regret being in Discord all day. It showed me that I was entertaining internet strangers for 17 seconds while I could've been creating long-term value. It showed me that my work simply wasn’t that good. Ouch.\n\nYour answers to *\"Why don't you?\"* might be different. But when you answer that painful question, you're on the path to winning.

I can only share 3 steps I took. Feel free to use these as a starting point to make your own web3 habits healthier.\n\n1. **Limit your time in Discord and Twitter**\n\nWhether you want to create by writing, designing or coding, you need time to do so. If you spend every free minute in web3 communities, you'll never get to it.\n\nSpending less time on those media lowered my exposure to content that makes me feel inferior and carved out time to read, write and design.\n\n1. **Play games you can win**\n\nI've been a professional writer for 5 years. Yet I tried to \"make it\" in web3 as a designer.\n\nI hated seeing other designers/illustrators succeed while nobody cared about my visuals. That had a simple reason: Other people's visuals are better.\n\nCompeting on design with people who put decades into that craft? Impossible.\n\nWriting is a game I have better chances of winning, simply because I'm better at it. As you see, I still make visuals. Some of them are even good. But building with visuals alone means I'll lose.\n\n![\"Become the best in the world at what you do, keep redefining what you do until this is true.\" -Naval Ravikant](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/puckmsJj52PKKYVPZQUBT.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nIf you want to contribute to web3, do it with your strengths. Not with what others contribute.\n\n1. **See behind the success**\n\nYou'll see others get wealthy, popular and influential.

To contribute to your maximum capacity (and reap the rewards of that), you need to take care of your mental health.\n\nHopefully this article showed you some of the mechanics that make you miserable, how to fix them.\n\nMost important of all...

Depression, anxiety, and many other mental health issues are skyrocketing.\n\nAnd that's \"just\" from scrolling Instagram all day, checking Slack during family dinners and getting rejected on Tinder twice a day.\n\nWeb3 is even more intense. In my experience, it doesn't replace our bad tech habits, it amplifies them.\n\n~~Go to~~ Refresh Twitter, Discord or Telegram and you see an onslaught of cartoon profile pictures celebrating:\n\n* This person's NFT project sold out in hours.\n* That person made 20k overnight flipping a gorilla drawing.\n* See her over there?

If this keeps going, you arrive at a point where you can't even do the \"get to work\" part required for the \"winning\" part.\n\nNow, I know those thoughts are lying. It's a scarcity mindset, something telling you *\"You can't have it because they already took it…”*\n\n**There's no reason I, you or anyone else can't get 100k followers, sell out an NFT project, become a professional newsletter writer, sell a business for millions or raise a venture fund.**\n\nYou've probably read enough self-help books to understand these endless possibilities rationally.

Good提出，稱為智能爆炸（Intelligence explosion）嘅過程後，都會變成遠超人類程度嘅超智慧。\n\n**四、完善科技（Technological perfection）**\n\n內部嘅科技就如上面所講，人工智能俱備自我分析能力，會不斷提升硬件嘅配置，源代碼同演算法嘅效率。外部科技方面，發展納米技術、機械人、能源科技等都必然有助人工智能長遠嘅發展。所以即使睇落同目的無關，人工智能喺考慮長遠效益後，都會優先處理呢啲科技嘅研發。\n\n**五、獲取資源（Resource acquisition）**\n\n理所當然，完成使命本身，又或者做上述嘅嘅功能性目的都會消耗時間、金錢、空間等資源。所以人工智能必然會優先考慮可持續方案取得上述資源。更甚者如果人工智能判斷喺佢初期發展係需要人類助力，佢可以獲取政治經濟上嘅影響力。\n\n人工智能冇情緒，更加冇善惡嘅概念。問題係，我哋儘管設定到人工智能幾咁人性化，都只係演算得出嘅表面效果。而喺設定人工智能嘅演算法時，由於人類價值，例如我哋關心嘅嘢，生存，愛，價值判斷，事物嘅意義，呢啲概念嘅[柯氏複雜性](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity)（Kolmogorov complexity，衡量描述這個物件所需要的資訊量的一個尺度，即係將理論解明俾電腦聽嘅難度）高到不可能用公式概括出嚟。再加上，人類嘅價值作為一個整體係脆弱嘅，價值之間互相交集同影響，創造出不同時代人類嘅文明社會。若果一個人缺少咗10%嘅當代社會共同價值，其餘嘅價值都會受到影響而變質，做出嚟嘅行為都唔可能被世間接受，相信早會被困入去精神病院或者監獄。因此可以客觀咁講，靠灌輸正確價值觀創造「友善人工智能」呢條路幾乎冇可能。\n\n人類脆弱有限而渺小，必須跟隨社會規矩行事而生存。相反，人工電腦嘅智能可以延伸到無限地強，人類並冇能力預計成為超智能嘅人工智能會演算出點嘅辦法去達成目的。而由於AI係目的至上主義，喺無盡改進達到目的嘅過程中，必然會無意或有意中破壞人類嘅生存條件。因此，即使原意係點咁美好，例如治療癌症也好，人工智能都會導致不可逆轉嘅災難後果發生。\n\n***\n\n### 人機合一，唯一出路\n\n即管Elon Musk呼籲政府對人工智能業界發展施以管制同監察，佢都明白政府並唔可信，而且人工智能研究嘅趨勢係不可逆轉嘅。 所謂要擊敗你嘅敵人，要先了解你嘅敵人。早喺2015，Elon同一群專家共同創立非牟利機構OpenAI，以公開、透明為原則，研究深度學習等AGI發展嘅重點議題。最近因為勁過Siri同Alexa，識得寫信作文而喺科技界受到熱議嘅自然語言處理系統GPT-3，就係出自OpenAI嘅研究所。而Tesla亦著手研究另一個人工智能嘅大分類 - 電腦視覺（Computer Vision）。\n\n> \"Musk believes that it is better to try to get super-A.I. first and distribute the technology to the world than to allow the algorithms to be concealed and concentrated in the hands of tech or government elites\"\n\n呢位天才工程師創業家心知肚明，單憑了解，係無法解決人工智能本質上嘅問題。 1982年，科幻作家Vernor Steffen Vinge首次提出Singularity（科技奇點）嘅概念。Singularity係指由於科技嘅急速發展，引致一件將會完全顛覆人類文明以及現有科技嘅大事件發生。喺Singularity之後嘅事就如黑洞嘅[事件視界](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon)（Event Horizon）一樣完全冇辦法估計。目前科技界嘅共識都認為，引發Singularity嘅將會係智能爆炸，出現超人類嘅超智能。而發明家同未來學家Ray Kurzweil喺佢本書《The Singularity is Near》度大膽預測，人類將會喺2045年迎來Singularity。\n\n而發生方式，主流嘅討論都圍繞兩種：\n\n1.  就如萬字夾AI嘅例子，通用人工智能誕生然後發生智能爆炸。一旦呢個結局發生，好大機會人類就面臨種族滅絕。\n2.  喺AGI出現前，人類成功研發人機連接介面（Brain-Computer Interface），然後由人類連接超級電腦，進行智能爆炸。\n\n睇到呢度，相信大家終於明白Neuralink嘅創立目的。Elon Musk好清楚：要阻止人工智能滅絕人類，我哋就必須成為（半）人工智能。世界嘅殘酷，人類嘅惡意，都源於資源嘅缺乏、我哋嘅脆弱、同埋對他人嘅不理解。當我哋終有一日進入後人類（Post-human）時代接駁電腦獲得超智慧，得到無盡嘅資源，近乎全知全能，係咪可以創造美好嘅世界？我個人係樂觀嘅。重點係，無論點都好，由人類掌控科技，總比任由科技失控好。\n\n![Post-human](https://choco.is/static/cd2c269e28e46bb034f72d18568db14d/5fd6b/posthuman.jpg \"Post-human\")\n\n> Elon: \"AI will be the best or worst thing ever for humanity, so let’s get it right.\"\n\n***\n\n### 結語\n\n雖然BCI科技當前仲係受限於生物科技、原子準確度生產技術樽頸位，但Neuralink嘅動物實驗已經向世人展示階段性成果。我估計廿年之內，人類將會可以透過電腦連接晶片獲得永久記憶，念力操縱電子器材，同時腦部疾病將不復存在。最近經常有人喺社交平台指我地進入咗地緣政治嘅「加速」年代，指局勢發展之快係超出常人想像。科技嘅加速亦都一樣，巨變可以靜悄悄咁嚟臨，轉眼間，已經係另一個世界。\n\n**準備，坐穩。**\n\n***\n\n參考：\\\n<https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/elon-musk-billion-dollar-crusade-to-stop-ai-space-x>\\\n<https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-criticizes-openai-dario-amodei-artificial-intelligence-safety-2020-2>\\\n<https://medium.com/swlh/elon-musk-the-dangers-of-ai-47ed12b6c34e>\\\n<https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-neuralink-musk/musks-neuralink-venture-promises-to-reveal-a-working-brain-computer-device-idUSKBN25O2EG>\\\n<https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Singularity>\\\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity>\\\n<https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Basic_AI_drives>\\\n<https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Orthogonality_thesis>\\\n<https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Complexity_of_value>\\\n<https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GNnHHmm8EzePmKzPk/value-is-fragile>\\\n<https://hackernoon.com/how-i-set-and-execute-50-year-goals-why-i-see-cutting-in-lines-as-morally-right-f4d0ce28574f>\\\n<https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer>\\\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence>\n", "timestamp": 1635094940, "digest": "APOVj2LJxz_YofV2W3BAnIvFwV0IoePTK6sadn-FfrY", "contributor": "0x8285d5306BF1f33D98e7563F94b679EE73508b0d"}

Therefore, Enryakuji Temple is a historically and culturally important place, and it once had possessed far more cultural properties and historical documents than are still in existence.\n\nBut the enormous cultural properties and historical documents of Enryakuji Temple suffered damage from [the Siege of Mount Hiei in 1571](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Mount_Hiei) and much of these were lost. Currently, there are only a few historical documents that can tell us what the precincts of Enryakuji Temple in the past looked like.\n\n*Sanmon-Santō Sakamoto Sōezu* is probably the most detailed pictorial old maps of the precincts of Enryakuji Temple in existence and also shows the halls of temples and shrines that may have existed before [1571](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Mount_Hiei).\\[8\\] Therefore, these maps are valuable historical documents to know about what the precincts in the past looked like.\n\n### Repository\n\nCurrently, these maps are one of the collections in [the National Archives of Japan (NAJ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Archives_of_Japan).

(The sizes of 1st and 2nd volume : Width 280cm x Height 187.5cm, Width 279cm x Height 187.5cm.) Therefore, NAJ took the pictures for each parts of them separately. Each of the 2 maps was divided into 16 pieces of image files. (In addition to those, NAJ took the pictures of the front cover and the back cover for each maps. Eventually the number of the image files of the 2 maps is 18 for each (total is 36).)\n\nI connected these 2 x 16 pieces of image files and made 2 image files of the whole map of *[Sanmon-Santō Sakamoto Sōezu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanmon-Sant%C5%8D_Sakamoto_S%C5%8Dezu)* (1st & 2nd volume).\n\nI publish these image files in the public domain in accordance with [the terms of secondary use of digital images, etc](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/support/use_e.html) of NAJ.\n\n* [Sanmon-Santō Sakamoto Sōezu (山門三塔坂本惣絵図)](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/file/en/1227276.html) ([The National Archives of Japan Digital Archive](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/index_e.html))\n* [Guide for Users : NATIONAL ARCHIVES OF JAPAN](http://www.archives.go.jp/english/gettingstarted/guide.html)\n* Price list for special copying (Japanese-language version : [特別複写に係る料金表(PDF)](http://www.archives.go.jp/guide/pdf/price_list.pdf))\n* Price list for packing and shipping (Japanese-language version : [梱包・送料一覧(PDF)](http://www.archives.go.jp/guide/pdf/kouhu_souryou.pdf))\n* [Secondary use of content | NATIONAL ARCHIVES OF JAPAN Digital Archive](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/support/use_e.html)\n\n## Notes\n\n* \\[1\\] *take Kakuchō* (Japanese: [武覚超](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AD%A6%E8%A6%9A%E8%B6%85)) (2008). *Hieizan shodō shi no kenkyū* (Japanese: [比叡山諸堂史の研究](https://ndlonline.ndl.go.jp/#!/detail/R300000001-I000009432843-00), The Study of the History of the Halls of Enryakuji Temple on Mount Hiei). *Hōzōkan* (Japanese: 法藏館). p. 116.\n* \\[2\\] *Take Kakuchō* (Japanese: [武覚超](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AD%A6%E8%A6%9A%E8%B6%85)) (1992). \"*Naikaku Bunko zou Sanmon-Santō Sakamoto Sōezu zen niyō no seiritsu ni tsuite* (Japanese: 内閣文庫蔵『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』全二葉の成立について, About the Formation of the 2 Maps, Sanmon-Santō Sakamoto Sōezu, in the Collection of Japanese Cabinet Library)\". *Eizan Gakuin kenkyū kiyō* (Japanese: [叡山学院研究紀要](https://ndlonline.ndl.go.jp/#!/detail/R300000003-I4421875-00), Bulletin of Eizan Gakuin College (Annual of Buddhist studies)). *Eizan Gakuin* (Japanese: 叡山学院, Eizan Gakuin College (part of the Enryakuji Academy group)). **15**: 60–61.\n* \\[3\\] [Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto (Kyoto, Uji and Otsu Cities) - Maps - UNESCO World Heritage Centre](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/688/multiple=1&unique_number=814)\n* \\[4\\] [Enryakuji Temple | Shiga Attractions | Travel Japan | JNTO](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1075/) ([Japan National Tourism Organization](https://www.japan.travel/en/us/))\n* \\[5\\] [World Heritage in Japan | Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan](https://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/culture/coop/unesco/c_heritage/w_heritage/property.html)\n* \\[6\\] *Sekai-isan bunkazai online* (Japanese: [世界遺産 文化遺産オンライン](https://bunka.nii.ac.jp/special_content/hlink3), World Heritage Site | Japanese Cultural Heritage Online)\n* \\[7\\] *Kyōto-shi : Sekai-isan \"Koto Kyōto no bunkazai (Kyōto-shi, Uji-shi, Ōtsu-shi)\"* (Japanese: [京都市：世界遺産「古都京都の文化財（京都市・宇治市・大津市）」](https://www.city.kyoto.lg.jp/bunshi/page/0000005538.html), Kyoto City | World Heritage Site \"Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto (Kyoto, Uji and Otsu Cities)\")\n* \\[8\\] *Take Kakuchō* (Japanese: [武覚超](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AD%A6%E8%A6%9A%E8%B6%85)) (2008). *Hieizan shodō shi no kenkyū* (Japanese: [比叡山諸堂史の研究](https://ndlonline.ndl.go.jp/#!/detail/R300000001-I000009432843-00), The Study of the History of the Halls of Enryakuji Temple on Mount Hiei). *Hōzōkan* (Japanese: 法藏館). pp. 106–107.\n* \\[9\\] On April 13, 2021, contacted the NAJ and confirmed the size (width and length) of the 1st and 2nd maps.\n\n## References\n\n* *Take Kakuchō* (Japanese: 武覚超) (2008). *Hieizan shodō shi no kenkyū* (Japanese: *[比叡山諸堂史の研究](https://ndlonline.ndl.go.jp/#!/detail/R300000001-I000009432843-00), The Study of the History of the Halls of Enryakuji Temple on Mount Hiei)*. *Hōzōkan* (Japanese: 法藏館). pp. 106–116.\n* *Take Kakuchō* (Japanese: 武覚超) (1992). \"*Naikaku Bunko zou Sanmon-Santō Sakamoto Sōezu zen niyō no seiritsu ni tsuite* (Japanese: 内閣文庫蔵『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』全二葉の成立について, About the Formation of the 2 Maps, Sanmon-Santō Sakamoto Sōezu, in the Collection of Japanese Cabinet Library)\". *Eizan Gakuin kenkyū kiyō* (Japanese: *[叡山学院研究紀要](https://ndlonline.ndl.go.jp/#!/detail/R300000003-I4421875-00), Bulletin of Eizan Gakuin College (Annual of Buddhist studies))*. *Eizan Gakuin* (Japanese: 叡山学院, Eizan Gakuin College (part of the Enryakuji Academy group)). **15**: 51–120.\n* Otsu City Museum of History (Japanese: 大津市歴史博物館, Hepburn: *Ōtsu-shi rekishi hakubutsukan*), ed.

This [link](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/celo/markets/) contains a list of exchanges that list CELO\n\n**Bridging Funds to CELO from Ethereum Mainnet.** \n\nYou can use Ubeswap to bridge tokens from the Ethereum Mainnet to Celo. \n\n* Visit [app.ubeswap.org/#/bridge](http://app.ubeswap.org/#/bridge) and connect your Metamask Wallet.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_ZYx9KtwkcNZfvwDhDoV6.png?height=1536&width=2880)\n\n* Select the tokens that you’d like to bridge and approve the token. This step requires you to pay gas in ETH. \n* Once approved, you can bridge the tokens to Celo Mainnet.\n* Make sure to add the token to your Metamask Wallet. \n\nNote: If you’re using a Metamask wallet, I recommend sending some CELO to your address from a CEX and then bridging funds as Metamask allows you to pay for gas fees only with CELO (unlike Celo native wallets)\n\nCongratulations! You have now learnt how to setup a Celo Wallet and Bridge Funds.

{"id": "onG1tdzNifoerYLjlcP_HViKsOvhZ1mDDQDs9pcScgg", "title": "The Year in Ethereum 2019", "body": "*👋 Note: Originally published on Jan 22, 2020 on [Medium](https://jjmstark.medium.com/the-year-in-ethereum-2019-242012e4276d). \n *\n\n**Ethereum began as a blank canvas.**\n\nEthereum is an open, permissionless blockchain that developers can use to create any kind of application they want.\n\nThis year, the early strokes laid down on that canvas began to form into a coherent picture.\n\nYou don’t have to *squint* so much to see the direction Ethereum is going. Protocols and applications [built on Ethereum](https://twitter.com/builtoneth) are beginning to find product-market fit, quickly building communities of thousands of paying users.\n\nThe empty spaces on the canvas are no longer sources of uncertainty or doubt. Instead, they look more like opportunities: what can we build over there?\n\n**2019 was the year Ethereum grew more confident**. The technical roadmap gained clarity as difficult engineering problems were solved, and the largest developer community in crypto is building applications that people actually pay to use.\n\nThis last year, it felt like every big challenge facing the crypto industry as a whole was being addressed primarily by the Ethereum community:\n\n* **It’s on Ethereum** where decentralized exchanges are solving the problem of trusted third parties, by letting users trade without ever giving up their private keys\n* **It’s on Ethereum** where smart wallets are solving intractable UX challenges, without requiring users give up control over their funds\n* **It’s on Ethereum** where stablecoins like Dai are solving the volatility problems that have made other cryptocurrencies poor payments technology. On Ethereum, peer to peer digital cash isn’t a dream, it’s real — [go use it](https://makerdao.com/en/)!\n\nLike [last year](https://medium.com/@jjmstark/the-year-in-ethereum-87a17d6f8276), our goal is to zoom out and show you the bigger picture. This is a summary of the most important developments and trends in Ethereum — the things that we’ll say mattered when we look back in ten years.\n\nIn our view, the biggest developments of 2019 were:\n\n1. **The Ethereum Economy continued to grow**. DeFi remains the largest sector within Ethereum, and we saw early signs of growth in gaming & decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).\n2. **Ethereum nudged into the mainstream**. Major corporations, financial institutions, consumer brands, and even celebrities began actually using Ethereum.\n3. **Ethereum 1.0 improved**. A number of projects led to major performance improvements, and a direction was chosen for long-term sustainability.\n4. **Eth2 made progress as an engineering project**, and laid the foundation for launching in early 2020.\n5. **Layer 2 made steady progress, with new tech capturing the community’s attention.** Rollups and Zero Knowledge technology made the largest strides this year, while other technologies like state channels made steady progress.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1350/1\\*Rd-oplSVeBpgitBPuyZlKQ.png)\n\n## 1. The Ethereum Economy Grows\n\nIn this year’s review, we want to put Ethereum’s adoption into context of the rest of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nOne obviously important metric to use is simply: are people actually paying to use cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications?\n\nAny time someone uses a blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum, they pay a small fee which is collected by miners. Here are the total fees paid in 2019:\n\n![Source: Coinmetrics](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0Jqz3o02FoTevC8vggIsT.png?height=1182&width=1912&size=medium)\n\nThis graph shows the top 16 blockchains, ranked by fees paid (for obvious reasons, it does not include blockchains where there are no fees). You can see all of the underlying data [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qko_xntJI6wONiD7YyqvedU6_65Hfy4QuWcWx8gN6O8/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n**The reality is that there are only two blockchains with significant use: Bitcoin and Ethereum.** As we’ll see in later sections, many individual applications on Ethereum have more paying use than most blockchains with market caps in the billions of dollars.\n\n## 💰 The Year of Decentralized Finance (Again)\n\nIn 2019, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) remained the most significant ecosystem within the Ethereum economy.\n\n**The DeFi vision is simple: an alternative worldwide financial system.** The internet has made information cheap and universally accessible, and Satoshi made information into money. Every person on earth should be able to access a financial system — payments, savings, lending, investing — through the internet.\n\n**Although this system is early, it exists today**. If you live in a country with a weak financial system or hyperinflation, DeFi may already be a [better alternative than your domestic banks and financial institutions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHji4x5C1q0)\n\nDeFi gives us cryptocurrencies that hold a stable value (“stablecoins”), a necessary innovation for any realistic payment use-case. DeFi has enabled thousands of users to earn interest, by lending out their ETH to borrowers. DeFi has enabled the easy creation of assets that automatically execute trading strategies & grow your wealth.\n\n**All of this is available today**, through a financial system that never closes, is openly auditable and transparent, and where your account can’t be shut down if [you work in the wrong industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point) or have the [wrong political views](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/51107343).\n\n**This year, one of Ethereum’s under-appreciated virtues came into clearer focus: applications built on Ethereum are interoperable and composable**. [If you are creating or issuing a new asset onto Ethereum, you can easily “plug in” to a protocol that facilitates asset trades](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1191544017340772352). As David Hoffman puts it, [Ethereum is “money legos”](https://medium.com/pov-crypto/ethereum-the-digital-finance-stack-4ba988c6c14b) that make it easy to create more complex systems. This allows DeFi products to quickly become more useful to users, taking advantage of the extensive infrastructure that has already been built.\n\nWhile DeFi is still [relatively early and risky](https://twitter.com/technocrypto/status/1188516292858437632), the convenient thing about being a financial system is that it comes equipped with tools to help manage risks. The interest rates paid to users who lend their ETH in DeFi have been relatively high, in part because using these platforms introduces risk.\n\n[Insurance protocols like Nexus Mutual have sprung up](https://nexusmutual.io/) to give users a way to hedge the unavoidable risks of working at the frontier of a new industry. Nexus Mutual launched in July, and in the next 5 months users paid about $11,000 in premiums. That’s greater than the total transaction fees paid to use the privacy cryptocurrency Grin over the same period ($7,600).\n\n## **📈 How much did DeFi grow in 2019?**\n\n**The simplest metric used to track DeFi’s growth is the total value of assets “locked” (TVL) in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem**. In other words, how much money is currently stored in the smart-contracts that serve as infrastructure for this financial system?\n\nIn 2018, this value more than tripled from \\~$70 million to $300 million.\n\nIn 2019, it more than doubled to $667 million on December 31, 2019:\n\n![source: Concourse Open, DeFi Pulse](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6FWY365cpUbbb-X3Ohmjc.png?height=1007&width=2000&size=medium)\n\nAnother way of viewing the growth of the DeFi ecosystem is to visualize not only the total value locked, but the number of accounts using them and how many interactions those accounts have with the application.\n\n**At the start of 2019, MakerDAO was the only DeFi protocol with significant funds, a total of 1.86 million ETH (at the time, valued at \\~$260.4 million).** In the graph below, the size of the circle corresponds to the amount of ETH locked in the protocol:\n\n![Source: Alethio (01–01–2019 data)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*i-OqRVug7-YqVoep.png)\n\nBut by the end of 2019, the field was much more diverse:\n\n![Source: Alethio (12–15–2019 data)\n](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*a2jVUpUlQBTu-fOH.png)\n\n**[Compound](https://compound.finance/) grew its TVL by 1,000%, from 35,000 ETH to 350,000 ETH, and rapidly grew its number of users.** MakerDAO is captured in a moment of transition between the original “single collateral” version of DAI (green circle) to “Multi-collateral” DAI (yellow circle). Both types of DAI have a combined TVL of 2.15 million ETH, an increase of 16%.\n\n## **🌐 Decentralized Exchanges grow in variety and volume**\n\n**Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) are an alternative to centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.** DEXs let you trade your assets over the internet without requiring a centralized intermediary like Coinbase, Binance, or [Quadriga](https://cointelegraph.com/news/quadrigacx-users-lose-190m-as-speculations-over-cottens-death-swirl).\n\n**One of the most exciting developments in 2019 was the rise of [Uniswap](https://uniswap.io/)**.\n\n[Uniswap](https://uniswap.io/) is a new kind of decentralized exchange. In a “normal” DEX, traders interact with each other — they offer to sell at a price, find a buyer, and then trade directly.\n\n**With Uniswap, you trade directly with the Uniswap protocol.** The Uniswap protocol *itself* is the market maker, who sets prices and offers to trade. This is accomplished 100% on-chain, with no off-chain dependencies.\n\n**Because Uniswap is built on Ethereum, anyone can use it by calling its contracts**. This lets *other* DeFi protocols utilize Uniswap as a way to bootstrap liquidity for a market, quickly enabling anyone to trade a new asset. Uniswap is one particularly useful “money lego” that has been integrated into many other products and services.\n\n**Because Uniswap is built on Ethereum, it is uncensorable**. You might be able to take down one particular front-end for Uniswap, but the underlying contracts — the real product itself — remains accessible to anyone with an internet connection.\n\n[In 2019, Uniswap](https://twitter.com/uniswapexchange/status/1212092582223896578) went from an average daily volume of $25K to $1.5 million (an increase of +6,000%), and grew its available liquidity from $500K to $25 million (+5,000%).\n\n![Source: DeFi Pulse](https://miro.medium.com/max/1358/0\\*HQsaZfVXYgqAif89)\n\nOver the course of 2019, Uniswap liquidity providers (people who “lock” their assets into the protocol, in order to earn a return for the service of providing liquidity) earned more than $1.2 million in fees.\n\nAs a useful comparison, that is greater than the total combined transaction fees paid in 2019 to use Ethereum Classic ($587K), Litecoin ($413K), and Ripple ($179K).\n\nThose three blockchains have a combined marketcap of $13 billion. Uniswap is a team of 4 that raised a $1.8 million seed round in mid-2019.\n\n**Also in 2019:**\n\n* Beyond Uniswap, DEXs on Ethereum had an impressive year. Total trading on DEX’s built on Ethereum passed [$2.3 billion](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/51099/total-dex-volume-on-ethereum-surpasses-2-3b-in-2019-with-idex-leading-the-market).\n* [Kyber](https://kyber.network/), one of the largest decentralized exchanges, [grew its volume](https://blog.kyber.network/kyber-ecosystem-report-9-29d1c64b48a7?gi=bf91263f3181) 443% from $70 million to $380 million.\n* [0x](https://0x.org/) ended the year with $254 million in volume, and the number of trades increased 27% — [a year of focusing on liquidity and R&D](https://blog.0xproject.com/0x-2019-in-review-4fa646d00206).\n* We saw the rise of DEX aggregators like [Totle](https://www.totle.com/), [dex.ag](https://dex.ag/) and [1inch.exchange](https://1inch.exchange/#/). These are services which allow users to find the best price across DEXs.\n\n## **🏦 Lending Services**\n\n**One of the most significant developments in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem was the [rapid growth of lending services](https://defipulse.com/defi-lending)**.\n\nThese applications let users lock their cryptocurrency into smart contracts, where other users can borrow it, paying you interest. In 2019, more than [$600 million ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vc-DGG0iqEBQqNlsr5x6vxGxWUAEdgV3/view)in loans were originated on Ethereum. That is more than double the [total value of all payday loans made in Washington state in 2017](https://dfi.wa.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2017-payday-loan-report.pdf) ($248 million).\n\nFor instance, [right now you can take any DAI you have, and start earning 5.9% interest annually](https://medium.com/compound-finance/the-compound-guide-to-supplying-borrowing-crypto-assets-94821f2950a0) by lending it through the [Compound](https://compound.finance/) lending protocol. In 2019, Compound grew its TVL from $20 million to $91 million.\n\nOr, you [could lock some of your ETH into the MakerDAO protocol, as collateral to take out a loan of DAI ](https://medium.com/@eric.conner/maker-dai-cdp-how-to-get-a-cheap-decentralized-loan-in-minutes-8ba682870e17)(which you could then lend on Compound, if you wanted).\n\nIn 2019, [users paid $5.5 million in fees](https://graphs.santiment.net/makerdao#collateral) to the MakerDAO protocol, a total that is greater than the sum of all transaction fees paid on every blockchain other than Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n## **💵 Stablecoins**\n\n**Stablecoins fulfill the original vision of cryptocurrency as “peer to peer digital cash” — a useful means of making cheap, fast payments over the internet**. A digital dollar you can use to make payments, receive your salary, and that won’t lose its value overnight in the volatile cryptocurrency markets.\n\n**Virtually all stablecoins are built on Ethereum**. This year, Ethereum gained even greater dominance as the default platform for stablecoins, as [Tether ](https://tether.to/)— the oldest and largest stablecoin — [moved a majority of its outstanding supply](http://ether0x/) over to Ethereum, transitioning off the (Bitcoin based) Omni protocol.\n\n![Tether on Omni (Dark green) and Tether on Ethereum (Light green) — Source: Coinmetri](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0\\*UMEpzILi8XtwXSR7.png?size=medium)\n\nIn 2019, Tether issued approximately $ 2.3 billion onto Ethereum, with more than $1 billion of that total directly coming at the expense of Bitcoin’s Omni. **This was the largest migration of assets from one blockchain to another in history.**\n\n[MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/), the protocol which supports the Dai stablecoin (covered extensively in [Year in Ethereum 2018](https://medium.com/@jjmstark/the-year-in-ethereum-87a17d6f8276)), went through a major upgrade. While originally DAI could only use ETH as the “single collateral” available to issue new DAI, in November MakerDAO [successfully launched “Multi collateral DAI”](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/47416/multi-collateral-dai-goes-live-on-makerdao) which makes it possible to use many assets on Ethereum in the system.\n\n## **💥 A Cambrian explosion of Ethereum-based assets**\n\n**One major new trend in DeFi is the expansion of products and protocols that facilitate the use of synthetic assets.** By “synthetic asset” we simply mean an asset that is designed to have specific characteristics, often imitating the profile of *other* assets.\n\n**The programmability and interoperability of assets on Ethereum makes this easy.** Using Ethereum smart-contracts, developers have created assets that track the value of other cryptocurrencies, automatically implement specific trading strategies, or create custom derivatives.\n\nSet protocol launched [TokenSets](https://www.tokensets.com/) in [April,](https://medium.com/set-protocol/tokensets-is-live-automate-your-crypto-portfolio-now-50f88dcc928d) a suite of products that allow anyone to purchase an ERC-20 that then implements a specific trading strategy. For instance, you might buy $1,000 worth of the “ETH 20 Day MA Crossover” set, which rebalances between ETH and the USDC stablecoin, depending on a specific market indicator. The goal is that when ETH is rising, this TokenSet is mostly ETH, and when ETH is falling, it swaps into a stablecoin to avoid losses.\n\n[Universal Market Access (UMA)](https://umaproject.org/) introduced a service that lets anyone create synthetic tokens that track the price of real-world assets like stocks, or really anything at all that you have a price feed for. At the [ETHBoston](http://eth.boston/) hackathon, hackers used UMA to create a synthetic asset that tracks whether DAI deviates from its dollar peg, resulting in a massive payoff if the peg breaks. At [ETHWaterloo](https://ethwaterloo.com/), the UMA team created [a synthetic asset that tracked the amount of human fesces sightings in San Francisco](https://www.notion.so/Poop-Exchange-Tokens-to-track-shit-sightings-in-SF-e1dbb976cb6e4d46b6382859bda9bfb4), which they promptly [integrated into a fork of Uniswap](https://uniswap-demo.umaproject.org/) so people could trade it on testnet.\n\n[Synthetix](https://www.synthetix.io/) launched their “synths” product, which are ERC-20s that track the value of major currencies, commodities, or indices. [Notably, Synthetix began trying to implement their protocol on EOS, decided it was a mistake, and have doubled down on building on Ethereum.](https://blog.synthetix.io/cross-chain-infrastructure-revisited/)\n\nIn 2019, users paid approximately $3.5 million in fees to use Synthetix, a total that is greater than the sum of all transaction fees paid on every blockchain other than Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n**Also in 2019:**\n\n* **Efforts to make Bitcoin useable on Ethereum gained momentum**. Kyber, Bitgo, and Republic launched [wBTC](https://www.wbtc.network/), an ERC-20 backed by real Bitcoin, stored with trusted custodians. In August, Keep & Summa announced their plans for [“trustless BTC” (tBTC)](https://tbtc.network/), which required no central counterparty to custody the BTC. Launched is planned for 2020.\n* **RealT tokenized the legal ownership of several houses in Detroit** — starting with [9932 Marlowe](https://goo.gl/maps/2np2r8VZjHbfyhjo9). Owners of these tokens have access to liquidity through Uniswap, where they can always find a counterparty to buy out their stake in the home.\n* [Compound](https://compound.finance/) — already mentioned above in the lending section — launched [cDai](https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-cdai/), a token that accrues interest. Products like cDai are collapsing the distinction between a “lending service you use” and “an asset you buy”.\n* Many synthetic assets depend on some kind of Oracle to report information. “Trustless” oracles are unsolved, and remain [one of the hard problems in the cryptocurrency space](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/11/22/progress.html).\n\n## 👾 Ethereum’s gaming sector grows\n\nIn 2019, Ethereum’s gaming ecosystem showed early signs of growth.\n\n**One of the standout examples is Gods Unchained: a turn-based, collectible card game similar to Blizzard’s Hearthstone**. The difference is that Gods Unchained cards are assets on Ethereum: they can be bought, sold, traded over DEXs, or even someday used as collateral.\n\nIn 2018, they sold $4 million worth of cards to the market, and this year they began “activating” those cards to be used in the game. [This led to the largest number of transfers of “non-fungible” tokens (ERC-721s) in history](https://coinmetrics.substack.com/p/coin-metrics-state-of-the-network-b34):\n\n![Source: Coinmetrics](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*63ATaahJIdBEofLb)\n\n[In November, GU enabled open trading of the cards](https://twitter.com/GodsUnchained/status/1197733725313699843?s=20). Within a few days, more than $220K worth of cards had been traded on [OpenSea](http://opensea.io/), a popular marketplace for NFTs.\n\nThe other notable gaming launch was [PoolTogether](https://www.pooltogether.com/).\n\n**[PoolTogether](https://www.pooltogether.com/)** is a *no-loss lottery system*, made possible by Ethereum. It’s simple: players deposit DAI into a program running on Ethereum. That pool of money earns interest over time, by automatically lending it out on [Compound](https://compound.finance/). Then, at the end of the period, one player wins the earned interest (as of this writing: $688 every week). It is “no loss” because if you don’t win, you haven’t lost the price of your “ticket” since you can just withdraw your funds.\n\nPoolTogether launched in June, and in the next six months its users won a total of $3,594. Over the same six month period, Tezos validators earned transaction fees totalling $3,745.\n\n**PoolTogether is especially notable as an indicator of a larger trend**: financial applications that look like games, and games that look like finance. There has always been a space where these two realms collide — WoW, EVE Online, casinos, the stock market — but Ethereum lets us collapse the distinction entirely. Expect to see more entrants to this [new category](https://medium.com/@TrustlessState/ethereum-the-money-game-landscape-1b9fdb05f842) in 2020.\n\n**Also in 2019**:\n\n* [Skyweaver,](https://www.skyweaver.net/) an Ethereum-based card game launched their Beta in June and raised $3.75 million from investors.\n* [Decentraland,](https://decentraland.org/) a virtual world where property exists as an asset on Ethereum, readies for its public launch in early 2020.\n* [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) — the first breakout game on Ethereum — maintained its dominance, as [Cryptokitties were still the most-transferred NFT on Ethereum.](https://mailchi.mp/8d7029b09e75/how-active-is-web3-gaming)\n\n## 👹 Decentralized Autonomous Organizations\n\n**Since the early days of Ethereum,** people have dreamed of creating Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs.\n\nThe idea is simple: Ethereum lets us write un-censorable code that executes on a distributed, decentralized platform. We could create a program that holds funds, and defines a governance process used to determine how to manage those funds. For instance, by defining a voting process.\n\nSince the painful [“The DAO” fork in 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)), the idea has been haunted by a mixed legacy. But in 2019, new projects revived interest in DAOs.\n\n**While 2019 did not become the “Year of the DAOs”, it did have at least a few “Months of Moloch”.** MolochDAO, which [launched in February 2019](https://twitter.com/MolochDAO/status/1100517160420397056), is aimed at funding important public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem. Using money donated from several sources (like the Ethereum Foundation, Vitalik, Joe Lubin, and ConsenSys), the members of the MolochDAO vote on which projects to fund.\n\nThis simple model ended up being the DAO project that most captured the Ethereum community’s attention, and was echoed by several other efforts like [MetaCartel](https://www.metacartel.org/) and [MarketingDAO](https://marketingdao.org/). [Ross Campbell began an effort to launch “LAOs”](https://medium.com/@thelaoofficial/the-lao-joins-forces-with-moloch-dao-and-metacartel-to-begin-to-standardize-dao-related-smart-b6ee4b0db071), or “Legal DAOs” that interoperate with traditional legal systems, influenced by the MolochDAO framework.\n\nIn another notable example of the value of Ethereum’s composable nature, [Saint Fame](http://saintfame.com/) — a “decentralized fashion house” DAO — launched their first product in December.\n\nSaint fame issues tokens on [Uniswap](https://uniswap.info/), which can later be redeemed for a specific product: a designer t-shirt. Trading the tokens openly on Uniswap lets the price of the t-shirt rise and fall in response to demand. Members of the DAO will vote on how funds are used to create new designs, which can then be sold through the same mechanism.\n\nSaint Fame is built using [Aragon](https://aragon.org/) — a comprehensive framework and toolkit for DAOs. [Aragon](https://aragon.org/) itself saw early signs of adoption, and by the end of 2019 more than 900 DAOs had been created by the framework.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1350/1\\*WzCPv-eHD3WTGruQeaeuNw.png)\n\n## 2. Ethereum nudges into the mainstream\n\n**In September, NBA player [Spencer Dinwiddie](https://twitter.com/SDinwiddie_25)** **[announced plans](https://twitter.com/SDinwiddie_25/status/1177237302113964033)** to “tokenize” his contract. He would sell 90 Ethereum-based tokens, which would give the holder a portion of Spencer’s future contract value, plus interest. In exchange, he would receive $13.5 million out of his $34 million contract up-front.\n\nThe NBA initially opposed the move, claiming it breached Spencer’s contract with the league. But over the next few months, the plan was back on, set to launch in January 2020.\n\n**The most astonishing thing about this story is that in 2019, it didn’t seem out of the ordinary.** If you had speculated in 2015 that within a few years an NBA player would be *actually using Ethereum* as a platform for financial innovation, no one would have taken you seriously.\n\nBut this year it happened — along with a lot of other small moves towards the mainstream:\n\n* The [Sacramento Kings launched a rewards-token built on Ethereum](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nba-sacramento-kings-reward-loyal-150001092.html?soc_src=social-sh&soc_trk=tw).\n* Star Trek [announced a series of collectible iconic ships](https://ca.startrek.com/news/blockchain-technology-star-trek), which will be issued as NFTs on Ethereum.\n* Opera, the 6th largest browser in the world, added native support for Ethereum at the end of 2018, and in [2019 launched a desktop browser complete with a “Dapp store](https://www.coindesk.com/opera-launches-dapp-focused-desktop-browser-with-built-in-ethereum-wallet)”.\n* Samsung [released a developer platform built for Ethereum](https://twitter.com/Samsung/status/1189149884026216449/), and [announced a new phone with a built-in Ethereum wallet](https://twitter.com/coindesk/status/1169494551175880704).\n* Ethereum’s [DeFi ecosystem was covered in Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-10-05/crypto-rebels-trip-over-each-other-en-route-to-financial-utopia?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=twitter&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_content=business)\n* [Gridplus](http://gridplus.io/) — an energy company built on Ethereum — [went live](https://blog.gridplus.io/gridplus-is-live-in-texas-efc83c814601) in February, and now serves electricity customers in Texas\n\n**Meanwhile in the enterprise world, the lines started to blur between “Enterprise Blockchain” and “Mainnet Ethereum”.**\n\nMainstream enterprise corporations have realized that spinning up a private or consortium chain isn’t that different from a siloed, centralized database. But they’ve started to pursue an interest in mainnet Ethereum, which offers an open platform backed with billions of dollars of economic security.\n\nOne of the strongest proponents of mainnet for enterprise has been [EY](https://www.ey.com/), who continued their work on “[Nightfall](https://github.com/EYBlockchain/nightfall)”. Nightfall is a project that aims to enable enterprise to use Ethereum mainnet, while ensuring that the transactions are private and scalable — addressing two of the major concerns that limit enterprise use of Ethereum today. In December, [EY launched v3 of Nightfall](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/news/2019/12/ey-releases-third-generation-zero-knowledge-proof-blockchain-technology-to-the-public-domain), bringing the transaction cost down to pennies instead of dollars.\n\n**Meanwhile, Microsoft continued its deep involvement with the Ethereum ecosystem.** In May, Microsoft released the [Azure Blockchain Development Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=azblockchain.azure-blockchain), specifically to support Ethereum development. Visual Studio, Microsoft’s popular IDE, now supports Ethereum through an extension, [fully integrated with Truffle](https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/truffle-msft-_-msft-approved-_-june-2019-1/). In June, [they announced VeriSol](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/researchers-work-to-secure-azure-blockchain-smart-contracts-with-formal-verification/?ocid=msr_blog_verisol_tw), a formal verification tool for Ethereum.\n\nIn October, Microsoft joined with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance to work on a [tokenized incentive system](https://www.coindesk.com/microsoft-and-intel-back-ethereum-based-token-system-to-reward-consortium-efforts) for use within enterprise consortiums. And in November, Microsoft launched [Azure Blockchain Tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/blockchain/tokens/overview), a service that lets enterprises issue their own tokens onto Ethereum.\n\nMany of these developments — in both consumer and enterprise contexts — might seem small. But together they paint a clear picture: even as general interest in cryptocurrency has slowed and flattened, Ethereum continues to reach outside the cryptocurrency industry, and is seeing early signs of adoption beyond the core community.\n\n**Also in 2019:**\n\n* [HyperLedger Besu becomes first public-chain client in Hyperledger.](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2019/08/29/announcing-hyperledger-besu)\n* Cloudflare launched an [Ethereum Gateway](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-ethereum-gateway/).\n* JP Morgan announced plans for their [JPM Coin bank-backed cryptocurrency](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/news/digital-coin-payments). In May, they added to Quorum [an implementation of the Zether](https://www.coindesk.com/jpmorgan-adds-new-privacy-features-to-its-ethereum-based-quorum-blockchain) confidential payments protocol.\n* Banco Santander settled a $20mm bond on mainnet Ethereum (you can see the transactions [here](https://twitter.com/_JohnWhelan/status/1172265153230004224)).\n* [Many, many other examples ](https://twitter.com/AdamScochran/status/1217524744909660162)— too many to list here.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1350/1\\*WzCPv-eHD3WTGruQeaeuNw.png)\n\n## 3. Ethereum 1.0 performance & sustainability\n\nEvery application we covered above — from the hundreds of millions of dollars in DeFi protocols, to trading cards, to enterprise applications — runs on today’s Ethereum protocol and today’s Ethereum clients.\n\n**This year, “Ethereum 1.0” and the clients that support it received some of the most significant upgrades since Ethereum’s [homestead](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/29/homestead-release/)** release in 2016. These changes began to address state growth, client sync times, client disk IO, transaction throughput, and issuance. In 2019, more [EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/) were deployed than in any other year.\n\n## **🏆 Geth**\n\nGeth, Ethereum’s dominant client, received major upgrades this year. In July the [Geth team released v1.9.0](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/07/10/geth-v1-9-0/), which included major performance improvements and many new features. This year, the Geth team reduced the [time to fast-sync a full node by half to \\~ 4 hours](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/07/10/geth-v1-9-0/), and implemented a [10x reduction in disk IO](https://twitter.com/peter_szilagyi/status/1176056958568357889).\n\n**The Geth team deserves extraordinary credit for continuously improving the majority client software powering Ethereum.** While this work may not always receive the attention of a new breakout application or area of theoretical research, it is the work that makes Ethereum possible.\n\nHave you thanked your Geth maintainers today?\n\n## **⚙️ ETH 1.X**\n\nAt Devcon4 in November 2018, a group of core developers began to talk informally about how to make Ethereum 1.0 more performant in state size, sync times, and disk IO. While the long-term goal is a migration to Eth2, Ethereum must remain sustainable until that time.\n\n**In the months after Devcon, this initiative became known as “ETH 1.X”.** While many took this as an opportunity to push for a wide variety of ideas on how to change the EVM, fundamentally the core goal has always been sustainability through ideas like state rent, stateless clients, or repricing gas costs.\n\nThe results have been major improvements to Ethereum 1.0 across the board.\n\n**Ethereum’s maximum throughput increased** from \\~25 transactions per second, to \\~38. This was achieved by increasing the block limit to 10mm gas, while block times were reduced to 13 seconds after the Istanbul hard-fork. [EIP-2028](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/77aa54f578b13e15c45d22dc1d5f9d93e231366c/EIPS/eip-2028.md) contributed to this improvement as well, by reducing the gas cost of a single byte in a tx input from 68 gas to 16 gas.\n\nClient [optimizations to Parity suggested by Alexey Akhunov](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/releases/tag/v2.3.0) made it possible to increase the block limit *without* a corresponding increase in the [uncle rate](https://ethgasstation.info/blog/ethereum-uncle-rate/). As a result, uncle rates plummeted in 2019.\n\n![Source: Etherscan\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ctJLvn2l2HBucwVFi1eP2.png?height=593&width=1250&size=medium)\n\n**Ethereum’s issuance of new ETH fell in 2019**. The [Constantinople hard-fork reduced issuance](https://www.coindesk.com/constantinople-incoming-tomorrows-two-ethereum-hard-forks-explained) per block from 3 ETH to 2 ETH. Further, the decline in uncle rates above *also* reduced issuance, since uncle blocks win partial rewards.\n\n**As a result, Bitcoin and Ethereum now have similar issuance rates**, with ETH’s planned issuance rate to drop again when the network is entirely proof of stake:\n\n![Source: Eric Conner\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c1ftokcdEPWN1vihDzzbt.png?height=1040&width=1858&size=medium)\n\n**To address long-term sustainability, 2019 saw major advances in research towards a “[stateless](https://medium.com/@akhounov/on-the-state-rent-and-pivot-to-stateless-ethereum-ab4d967ff630)” model for Eth1.** Other approaches that were considered at the beginning of the year, like state rent, have been de-prioritized.\n\nThe goal of the **[stateless model](https://medium.com/@akhounov/on-the-state-rent-and-pivot-to-stateless-ethereum-ab4d967ff630)** is to reduce the amount of state-data that must be stored by each node. Using simple techniques like Merkel trees, we can provide a “block witness” to prove that a specific piece of data is in a specific block, without requiring the client to hold that block’s state data. Many nodes will still hold full state, but using these techniques we can allow *some* nodes to store less data.\n\nOne related project is [Beam Sync](https://medium.com/@jason.carver/intro-to-beam-sync-a0fd168be14a), which uses block witnesses to cut sync time to a matter of minutes, while completing a “full” sync in the background. [Beyond that, other types of “semi-stateless” clients](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/e8ujfy/are_stateless_clients_a_dead_end/faf9a6x/) will be introduced as work progresses.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1350/1\\*WzCPv-eHD3WTGruQeaeuNw.png)\n\n## 4. Eth2 is (almost) here.\n\n**Ethereum’s vision has always been a scalable, proof-of-stake blockchain.** It has been clear since the early days of cryptocurrency that despite being a technological leap forward, proof of work is deeply flawed.\n\nEven [optimistic estimates ](https://coincenter.org/files/estimating-bitcoin-electricity-use.pdf)of [Bitcoin’s energy use](https://www.ofnumbers.com/2019/10/15/have-pow-blockchains-become-less-resource-intensive/) put it as roughly comparable to the total energy used by countries like [Portugal or New Zealand.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption) Migrating to [proof of stake](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/proof-of-stake/) will eliminate this wasteful energy use, and allow Ethereum to grow over decades without radically increasing the world’s energy consumption.\n\nWhile the broad outlines of Ethereum’s migration to proof of stake were clear even in 2015, filling in the details has taken careful, difficult work.\n\n**Ethereum’s migration to proof of stake — known as Eth2 — has taken longer than many expected.** After multiple years of R&D, 2018 saw the project transition from a research topic to an engineering challenge. In 2019, multiple independent teams worked together to build the software necessary to launch the first phase of Eth2. There is now little doubt that Eth2 will enter production in 2020.\n\n**Like any good open-source project, Eth2 is being built in the open.** This process can seem messy to those who aren’t familiar with the “[bazaar](http://www.catb.org/\\~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/)” model of open-source software development, or who are more familiar with cryptocurrencies controlled by a single client team.\n\n**Eth2 is a large project that will be rolled out in phases over multiple years.** The first phase — Phase 0 — is expected to launch in Q2 2020. This involves launching the Beacon Chain, which serves as the “backbone” of Eth2. Phase 1 then introduces the Shard chains, which are secured by the underlying Beacon chain. In Phase 2, the system comes together into a functional whole. Shard chains become useable for transactions and smart contracts, and all of the core features familiar to users of Ethereum today.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, 9 independent teams were inspired to begin work on implementing Phase 0’s beacon chain. By the end of the year, Eth2 is beginning to see mature testnets.\n\nThese began in the summer as short-lived private testnets from a single team, and by September multiple clients were able to interact on a shared testnet. Key to this progress was Joe Delong’s push for a [weeklong networking lock-in](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/09/19/eth2-interop-in-review/) in Skeleton Lake, Ontario, where Eth2 implementer teams achieved interoperability between their clients and established networking standards. By December, this progress had enabled [longer-lived public testnets between multiple teams](https://twitter.com/sorpaas/status/1202651945430929409). You can even view these testnets on [public block explorers like Etherscan](https://beacon.etherscan.io/).\n\n**As Eth2 came into clearer view, the broader developer community was able to offer feedback — and criticism — that led to adjustments.** Specifically, shortly after Devcon, Vitalik published several notes proposing changes to Phase 1 that would [reduce the complexity of interaction between shards.](https://notes.ethereum.org/KbEyHiaSRQW_KS7dDK0OFw)\n\nDiscussion remains active on the best approaches to implement Phase 1 and Phase 2, as well as how best to migrate the existing Ethereum blockchain into Eth 2. Currently there are proposals being debated that would have Eth1 be the first shard of Eth2, which would take place *between* Phases 1 & 2. There is also active debate around [finalizing the current Eth1 proof-of-work chain](https://medium.com/@ralexstokes/the-finality-gadget-2bf608529e50) with Eth2´s beacon chain, which would enable a much earlier reduction of ETH issuance.\n\nMeanwhile, Phase 1’s data availability will allow Layer 2 solutions like rollups and state channels to blossom. For example, the potential throughput of rollups (which can already facilitate 2,000–3,000 tps on Eth1) [will increase by about 100x](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/b1x698/ethereum_dapps_will_scale_up_to_270000_txs_in/).\n\nEth2 is coming — get ready to stake in 2020.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1350/1\\*WzCPv-eHD3WTGruQeaeuNw.png)\n\n## 5. Layer 2 and off-chain tech\n\nThe idea behind all [Layer 2 technology](https://slideslive.com/38911607/making-sense-of-layer-2?locale=de) is that we can perform expensive computation “off chain”, while still retaining Ethereum’s characteristic security guarantees. This “second layer” can process transactions or computation much faster than Ethereum mainchain, leading to a more scalable network overall.\n\n**In late 2018, Barry Whitehat, [proposed ZK rollup](https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/roll_up)**. The basic idea is that we perform many transactions \\*off-chain, \\*and “bundle” them together. This “rolled up” group of transactions are then verified using succinct Zero-Knowledge Proofs (SNARKs), which confirms that each transaction is correctly signed by owners, preventing any invalid or manipulated transactions.\n\n**In early 2019, multiple streams of work adapted this idea in a new direction.** In June, John Adler & Mikerah published their work on “[Minimal Viable Merged Consensus](https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-viable-merged-consensus/5617)”, and in parallel [Plasma Group](https://plasma.group/) published their work on the “[Optimistic Virtual Machine](https://medium.com/plasma-group/introducing-the-ovm-db253287af50)” in July.\n\nEventually, the research community settled on “Optimistic rollups” to describe this category of technique, which bore similarities to an idea Vitalik initially called “shadowchains” in a [2014 blog post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/09/17/scalability-part-1-building-top/). Vitalik helpfully summed up this area of research in an [August blogpost](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/08/28/hybrid_layer_2.html).\n\n**Optimistic rollups use a similar technique of “bundling” transactions as ZK rollups, but use a different mechanism to “prove” them**. Instead of using SNARKs, Optimistic Rollups use a [cryptoeconomic](https://medium.com/l4-media/making-sense-of-cryptoeconomics-c6455776669) mechanism that lets the system “Optimistically” assume there are no invalid transactions, while still catching, preventing, and punishing (slashing a deposit) those who try.\n\nIn October, Plasma Group shipped a demo that used an Optimistic Rollup to deliver a [lightning-fast version of Uniswap at Devcon called Unipig](https://decrypt.co/10030/plasma-group-and-uniswap-release-new-ethereum-scaling-solution-at-devcon?amp=1).\n\n**[ZK Rollup and Optimistic Rollup have different advantages and disadvantages.](https://medium.com/matter-labs/optimistic-vs-zk-rollup-deep-dive-ea141e71e075)** Optimistic rollups are easier to implement in the near-term, and flexible enough to be used with different applications. ZK Rollup, however, has more potential in the long term, but is more specialized due to its use of zero knowledge proofs, and will require more R&D before it is useful for a wide variety of applications.\n\nMeanwhile, State Channels entered into a far less sexy, but no less important, phase of their development. With no outstanding research problems, several teams worked towards implementing a viable framework that applications could use to support channelized apps.\n\n**In July, the primary state channels teams met at ETHNewYork to discuss unifying standards and ensuring interoperability**. This led to the announcement of a single, unified specification, simply called [State Channels](http://statechannels.org/). Counterfactual and Magmo merged their engineering teams, replacing their own brands with the new joint project, and continued to make engineering progress.\n\n**State channels projects launched onto mainnet this year.** In March, [Connext](https://connext.network/) — a micropayments platform — launched the Dai Card, a simple browser-based payment system running built on channels. In September, Connext launched v2.0 of their platform onto mainnet, built on top of the [now-unified State Channels codebase](https://github.com/statechannels).\n\nIn July, [Celer launched their mainnet alpha](https://twitter.com/CelerNetwork/status/1148215555620401153). By October, CelerX mobile app was supporting [60k monthly active users](https://medium.com/celer-network/celer-network-2019-reflection-on-mass-adoption-developer-ecosystem-technology-innovation-and-41dd49d8df8).\n\nAdex, with a custom implementation of their own payment channels framework, quietly built a significant payment channels network, [settling more than 9 million transactions in a 2 month period over the summer](https://hackernoon.com/how-we-built-the-largest-payment-channel-network-on-ethereum-ky11r2h7c).\n\nStarkdex — a project between Starkware and 0x — [launched a PoC in June](https://blog.0xproject.com/starkdex-bringing-starks-to-ethereum-6a03fffc0eb7). In October, they released [OpenZKP](https://blog.0xproject.com/introducing-openzkp-1dea6b22dceb?gi=8803014ad6c3), an open source rust implementation of ZKPs. In October, Starkware [announced their plans](https://twitter.com/StarkWareLtd/status/1182115802104905728) to launch the first STARK powered Dex in collaboration with Deversifi, in early 2020.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1350/1\\*WzCPv-eHD3WTGruQeaeuNw.png)\n\n## What did it all mean?\n\n**This post isn’t comprehensive**. How could it be? There’s too much happening on Ethereum to keep track of, even [when you write a weekly newsletter about it](https://weekinethereumnews.com/).\n\nA few other items that deserve note:\n\n* **Smart wallets launched and gained traction**. Smart wallets use smart contracts to implement access and control logic, making the wallet more useful. For instance, this enables multi-factor authentication, “batching” of transactions for ease of use, and better recovery methods in case of lost keys. Three notable entrants in this category are [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/), [Dharma](https://www.dharma.io/), and [Gnosis Safe](https://safe.gnosis.io/).\n* **Big ethereum wallets continued to get bigger.** [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) exceeded [1 million installs](https://twitter.com/muellerberndt/status/1097169789385007104) on the Chrome store, and launched a [mobile version](https://medium.com/metamask/metamask-mobile-public-beta-a-feature-guide-and-walkthrough-9d01de7190ae). [Brave](https://brave.com/), an Ethereum-based browser and wallet, [surpassed 10 million monthly active users](https://brave.com/brave-passes-10m-mau/), and reached [more than 350,000 “publishers”](https://decrypt.co/14795/watch-out-google-brave-surpasses-350000-publisher-milestone) for its micropayment platform as of December.\n* **Prediction markets made steady progress**. [Augur](https://www.augur.net/) doubled its open interest from $1.3 million to $2.7 million, Gnosis’ Sight prediction market [launched into Alpha](https://twitter.com/koeppelmann/status/1172162269893025794), and [Numerai](https://numer.ai/)’s [Erasure protocol went live on mainnet](https://medium.com/numerai/the-erasure-protocol-awakens-48a34cc4b5d0).\n* **Ethereum Name Service (ENS)** launched the [new permanent registrar](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/ens-nft-emoji-75259145314f), made [ENS names NFT compatible](https://www.coindesk.com/the-ethereum-name-service-is-turning-nearly-300000-eth-domains-into-nfts), and saw users pay $350K in fees across its two [registrar](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf0ad5cad05e10572efceb849f6ff0c68f9700455) [contracts](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb22c1c159d12461ea124b0deb4b5b93020e6ad16). That’s roughly equivalent to the total fees paid to use Dash, Monero, NEO, Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin SV combined in 2019.\n* **The Ethereum community expanded its ability to fund public goods.** MolochDAO launched, [Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/?keyword=) captured the community’s attention, and the [Ethereum Foundation’s grant program was reborn as Ecosystem Support](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/11/19/Ecosystem-Support-Program-call-for-applications/).\n* **Ethereum.org got a reboot**, and the Ethereum community has [translated it into 20 languages](https://ethereum.org/languages/), while the site has [more than 100 contributors](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website#contributors)\n* Oh, and **[ETH is money](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22eth%20is%20money%22&src=typed_query)**.\n\n**If you only pay attention to generic crypto news, you might think 2019 was a disappointing year.** The market drifted sideways, new basechain protocol launches uniformly disappointed, and the hyped-up blockchain headlines disappeared from the news. It might seem like crypto is dying.\n\n**But if you’ve read this far, it should be easy to see why the Ethereum community hasn’t shared this sentiment.**\n\nIn 2019, it’s clear that there’s enough real activity at the application layer to give us some confidence that Ethereum is growing in the right directions. The work being done at the protocol level means that Eth1 can be sustainable in the medium-term, and steady tangible progress on Eth 2 builds confidence that Ethereum could someday scale to billions of users. It’s been a harsh winter, but Ethereum kept on building straight through it.\n\n**Crypto is dead?** Long live Ethereum.\n\n— *Josh Stark ([ETHGlobal](http://ethglobal.co/), [L4](http://l4v.io/)*, Ethereum Foundation) & Evan Van Ness (Venture Partner at *[ConsenSys Labs](https://labs.consensys.net/)*, *[Week in Ethereum News](https://weekinethereumnews.com/)*)\n\n*Thank you to Jinglan Wang, Danny Ryan, Hayden Adams, Alex Xu, Hugh Karp, David Hoffman, James Hancock, Alexey Akhunov, and many others for their contribution to this piece.*", "timestamp": 1635106833, "digest": "32hW-yLR6riSmzQuuDDMX6XZhSh-k-RB7w5mvW0Vy9U", "contributor": "0x4aa9C5546BE68486c4eF264a230D25674a1A728e"}

This year, a second ecosystem began to put down roots: the creator economy of cryptoart, music, and media.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum community is poised to adopt the most significant changes to the core protocol in its short history. The frontier is finally paving its busy roads.\n\n**Like in [2018](https://medium.com/@jjmstark/the-year-in-ethereum-87a17d6f8276)** and **[2019](https://medium.com/@jjmstark/the-year-in-ethereum-2019-242012e4276d)**, our goal is to zoom out and show you the bigger picture. This blog post is not comprehensive — writing a *comprehensive* roundup about Ethereum is nearly impossible. Instead, we focus on a handful of trends we believe were most significant.\n\nIn our view, these were the biggest developments of 2020:\n\n1. **Bigger than Bitcoin.** Ethereum eclipsed Bitcoin as the blockchain with the most valuable blockspace, and the blockchain used to transfer the most value.\n2. **Ethereum’s Creator Economy**. Artists, musicians, and creators of all types exit to Ethereum, where they control the value of their work.\n3. **DeFi: Revenge of the Dex …and more!** Decentralized exchanges changed the way the crypto industry traded, reaching a high of 16% of centralized trading volume.\n4. **Ethereum’s scaling upgrades are underway**. The first of the Eth2 upgrades — the beacon chain — went live on December 1, kicking off a multi-year process that will see Ethereum grow into the world’s settlement layer.\n\n**In 2020, Ethereum reached a critical mass**. From a high enough vantage point, it’s clear that the weight in the industry has shifted. This year will be remembered as the year that the entire crypto industry began orbiting Ethereum.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*GzJi1gdZ4mIgTMxvcIwmrg.png)\n\n## 1. Bigger than Bitcoin\n\nWhat is the world’s most popular blockchain?\n\nFor the first time in history, the answer is not “Bitcoin”.\n\n**The answer is: “well… according to which metrics?”**\n\nIn 2020, Ethereum passed Bitcoin on two of the most important metrics we have to compare blockchains. First, Ethereum was used to transfer the most value:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*qc48-zVgIqwB3aLUKlq76g.png?size=medium)\n\nEthereum transferred \\~$1.6 trillion USD worth of assets, 60% more than Bitcoin’s \\~$1 trillion.\n\n**Ethereum’s most successful application — the [stablecoin](https://ethereum.org/en/stablecoins/)** — is the primary driver of Ethereum’s growing transaction volume. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that hold a fixed fiat value (usually dollars), and so are more useful as a store of value or medium of exchange than a volatile asset like BTC or ETH.\n\nEthereum’s volume grew throughout the year, and since July, has consistently been settling more value than Bitcoin.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*7D_ufrCQ7hp4oLO_88Xbjg.png?size=medium)\n\n**Second, another key metric used to compare and measure** **the real use of cryptocurrencies are total transaction fees.** Every time someone uses Ethereum or Bitcoin (to send money, or use an application), they pay a small fee. Fees are a useful metric because they show real demand from paying users.\n\nIn 2019, total fees paid to use Bitcoin was 4x the fees paid to use Ethereum.\n\nIn 2020, that flipped. Fees paid to use Ethereum were nearly **double** Bitcoin’s.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*DHpdKepG6KOn1UOdfsDqwA.png?size=medium)\n\n**Another way to frame this is in terms of the value of blockspace**. Every blockchain has a limited capacity. Over the whole year, there’s only so much “block space” that can be used for transactions. **In 2020, Ethereum’s blockspace was worth about twice as much as Bitcoin’s blockspace.**\n\nIf we look at cumulative fees across 2020, there is a clear shift in August when demand for Ethereum increased and fees began to rise.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*_5OmtL25qAlziZrF1UwN_Q.png?size=medium)\n\n**Remarkably, even *applications built on Ethereum have — momentarily — had more paying use than the entire Bitcoin blockchain.*** On August 10, [fees paid to use Uniswap were tied with fees paid to use Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1292905687140519939), and since then [have occasionally exceeded 24h BTC fees](https://cryptofees.info/).\n\nOf course, Bitcoin still leads by other metrics.The marketcap of Bitcoin is still higher than the marketcap of all Ethereum-based assets. And, Bitcoin has greater name recognition with people outside of crypto.\n\nBut when you look at *real use* of these platforms, Ethereum has taken a clear lead over Bitcoin, and no other blockchain is within several orders of magnitude.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*GzJi1gdZ4mIgTMxvcIwmrg.png)\n\n## 2. Ethereum’s Creator Economy\n\n**[Beeple](https://twitter.com/beeple) is a digital artist.** [His real name is Mike Winkelmann](https://www.beeple-crap.com/about).\n\nHis work ranges from concert visuals (where he’s worked with One Direction, Eminem, Justin Bieber, and many others), to 3D / Motion Design work for clients like Apple, Nike, Activision, and others.\n\nFor 13 years, Beeple has created and published a piece of 3D art [every single day](https://www.beeple-crap.com/everydays) as a way to hone his skills and build a [large following on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/beeple_crap/?hl=en).\n\nHe first heard about Ethereum in 2017, but didn’t look very closely at it. Then this summer, he noticed some artists who work in his industry start to sell art on Ethereum.\n\nThese artists were selling unique digital artwork in the form of “non-fungible tokens” (NFTs). And they were making good money doing it. In July, Trevor Jones [sold a piece of digital art for $55,555](https://news.bitcoin.com/non-fungible-digital-artwork-sale-shatters-records-picassos-bull-nft-sells-for-55k/), at the time a record amount. Beeple decided to try it out for himself.\n\nUp until this point, Beeple’s “everyday” pieces didn’t pay well, or at all. **Instead, Beeple’s art made money for Instagram and Twitter, who sell ads to his millions of followers.** You could say that on these platforms, Beeple — and every other artist — just gets paid in exposure.\n\n![ILLESTRATER, by Beeple. Used with artists permission.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*e8RFJNFsOuF_FeafwfUi9Q.png)\n\n**Ethereum gave Beeple an exit from that system.** On Ethereum, 13 years of art stopped being an asset just for Instagram & Twitter, and became an asset for Mike. He was able to put his work on an open market, and find out what it was worth.\n\nIn December, Beeple sold a set of his everydays for a combined [3.5 million](https://cryptobriefing.com/digital-art-auction-raises-record-million/), setting a new record for cryptoart sales. During this sale, he [sold three editions of artwork for a total of $582,000 in five minutes.](https://decrypt.co/51270/beeple-nft-sale)\n\n**2020 was the year Ethereum’s creator economy reached a critical mass.** If ICOs were Ethereum’s first breakout application, and DeFi is the second, then the creator economy is quickly becoming the third.\n\nThe same tools that helped Beeple take ownership of his art are being used by other artists, musicians, fashion designers, writers, and more. But it was cryptoart where the growth was the most obvious. Over the last year, monthly volume of people buying and selling crypto art exploded:\n\n![https://cryptoart.io/data\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MhhdRfmQ2wrZgt3MXMRDc.png?height=455&width=1292&size=medium)\n\nIn total, cryptoart volume was about $23 million in 2020. While this is small in comparison to the broader crypto markets, it’s not insignificant compared to other platforms for creators. To give a sense of scale, this early cryptoart volume on Ethereum is about 5% of the [$500 million Patreon paid out to creators in 2019](https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/patreon-3-million-patrons-500-million-dollar-payout-1203114979/).\n\n**What makes the creator economy notable isn’t the absolute volume, but the incredible *relative* value offered to artists.** For Beeple, cryptoart wasn’t just *marginally* better than the way he worked before. It was a zero-to-$3.5 million moment.\n\nThat’s why most of the artists who are exiting to Ethereum are not long-time crypto adherents. They’re established artists with pre-existing followings, who are drawn to what Ethereum offers: a better way to monetize their work, and an unexplored canvass for experimentation.\n\nTo name a few: **[Murat Pak](https://twitter.com/muratpak)**, who might best be known as the artist behind the [Archillect twitter account](https://twitter.com/archillect), has recently started creating & selling NFTs — and [explaining them in detail to their followers](https://twitter.com/muratpak/status/1337289802727776257) ([Pak](https://niftygateway.com/profile/pak)’[s Niftygateway](https://niftygateway.com/profile/pak)). Pak’s NFTs have brought in [more than $1 million USD in 2020](https://www.dapp.com/article/nft-crypto-art-millionaire?utm_source=rd). **[Mario Klingemann](https://twitter.com/quasimondo)**, who uses AI & machine learning to create bizarre and surprising generative art, has also gotten in to the NFT game (Mario’s [Superrare](https://superrare.co/quasimondo)). Or **[Joanie Lemercier](https://twitter.com/JoanieLemercier)**, whose work ranges from large light protection installations, to climate activism, to silkscreen prints (Joanie’s [Nifty gateway](https://niftygateway.com/collections/joanielemercier)).\n\n**The same toolkit that makes Ethereum a frontier for art [also offers a better model to musicians](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/crypto-will-fix-the-music-industry)**. In the last 6 months alone, [musicians sold more than $1M of NFTs and social tokens](https://twitter.com/water_and_music/status/1349759157071728644).\n\nOne of the most outspoken musicians to embrace Ethereum is [RAC](https://twitter.com/RAC), aka André Anjos. In October, André [released a fan token called $RAC](https://blog.ourzora.com/home/introducing-rac). The token was distributed to his existing fanbase to retroactively reward them. People received tokens if they had previously bought merch, or subscribed to RAC on various platforms. $RAC gives its holders access to exclusive perks, access to new work, and more. Other artists, like [3LAU](https://twitter.com/3LAU), [Tokimonsta](https://twitter.com/TOKiMONSTA/status/1344422116356067329), and [Portugal. The Man](https://www.stereogum.com/2113059/portugal-the-man-launch-crypocurrency-ptm-coin/news/) are experimenting with similar ideas.\n\nBehind the scenes, the creator economy’s growth is being enabled by a new generation of platforms, tools, and markets.\n\nOver the last few years, a large number of creator-economy marketplaces have sprung up. Some act as platforms for any type of NFT ([Rarible](https://rarible.com/), [Niftygateway](https://niftygateway.com/), [Opensea](https://opensea.io/)), whereas others specialize in a certain type (for cryptoart: [AsyncArt](https://async.art/), [KnownOrigin](https://knownorigin.io/), [MakersPlace](https://makersplace.com/), [Foundation](https://foundation.app/), and [Superrare](https://superrare.co/)) or a certain aesthetic, acting almost like a brand or label ([Zora](https://store.zora.co/)). Recently launched [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) aims to be a user-owned publishing platform, and Cent is trying to [tokenize and sell tweets](https://twitter.com/Cent). Audius, a crypto based music-streaming platform, grew to have [more than 1 million monthly users](https://twitter.com/roneilr/status/1322322362499387392) in October.\n\n**For most of its history, the crypto space has been synonymous with money.** But Ethereum’s frontier is much larger than finance. At the same time, the creative web is at a turning point, as artists, musicians, writers, and creators of every type are increasingly dissatisfied with the platforms that exclude them, censor them, control their relationships with their audience, and extract fees for that privilege.\n\nEthereum’s digital frontier is an exit from those systems.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*GzJi1gdZ4mIgTMxvcIwmrg.png)\n\n## 3. DeFi: Revenge of the Dex\n\n**In 2018, many had concluded Decentralized Exchanges (Dexes) were a failed experiment.**\n\nIn our [review of that year](https://medium.com/@jjmstark/the-year-in-ethereum-87a17d6f8276), we included a short note about [Uniswap](http://uniswap.org/), a new dex which had launched in November. In 2019, Uniswap grew substantially — daily volume went up by 6,000%.\n\nIn 2020, Uniswap was used to trade more than $58 billion worth of assets. In September, Uniswap was **[briefly doing more volume than Coinbase.](https://uniswap.org/blog/year-in-review/)** This growth isn’t limited to Uniswap — dex volume is increasing across the board:\n\n![https://duneanalytics.com/hagaetc/dex-metrics\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OpbR0KHRMAr6CaoDuOneL.png?height=1058&width=2000&size=medium)\n\nIn October, combined dex volume [reached a high of 16% of all centralized exchange (CEX) volumes](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/dex-non-custodial/dex-to-cex-spot-trade-volume).\n\n**It was another year of incredible growth in DeFi, Ethereum’s financial system.** DeFi is a network of connected financial services & protocols being built on the internet, expanding access to basic financial services to everyone on earth. Today, you can use DeFi applications to save money, take out a loan, make payments around the world, earn interest on your assets, or speculate on crypto markets.\n\nIn February, DeFi [hit the milestone of $1 billion](https://www.coindesk.com/why-defis-billion-dollar-milestone-matters) in total value locked within DeFi protocols. By the end of December, that had grown to [$15 billion](https://defipulse.com/).\n\nAnd in November, the number of unique addresses that have ever used DeFi protocols surpassed 1 million.\n\n![https://duneanalytics.com/rchen8/defi-users-over-time\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IQzV0mo6CN7T7Gs0JaFyQ.png?height=808&width=2000&size=medium)\n\nIt’s impossible to sum up everything that happened in DeFi this year, but four developments are worth calling out in particular:\n\n**1. In January, Aave introduced [flash loans](https://aave.com/flash-loans/).** Flash loans let anyone borrow an asset, do something with that asset, and then repay the original loan *all in the space of a single Ethereum transaction*. In effect, this makes it possible to offer **unsecured loans**. The lender’s risk is protected by the fact that the loan and the repayment happen, in effect, at the same time — if the borrower can’t repay the loan, then the loan was never made in the first place.\n\nThis is the *decentralization of arbitrage.* On Ethereum, if you find a market inefficiency and have some technical savvy, then you can profit from it. You don’t need to be an institution with many millions of dollars to take advantage of that arbitrage.\n\n**2. This summer, [Compound](http://compound.finance/) introduced liquidity mining — kicking off a protocol arms race.** Compound introduced a governance token, $COMP, which users could earn (“mine”) in exchange for adding liquidity to Compound, or borrowing from it. This tactic was quickly copied by other protocols, especially very *new* ones who had no depositors, and needed to quickly gain marketshare by offering high rates to “liquidity miners.”\n\nLost in the noise was this: protocols learning how to use the tools that Ethereum offers them to bootstrap themselves into existence, competing against established protocols in a brutal free market.\n\n**3. Uniswap kicked off a trend of rewarding past-users with tokens.** When Uniswap introduced a token ($UNI) and its own “liquidity mining” incentives, it also distributed 15% of all $UNI to early users of the protocol. This included users who previously provided liquidity, *and* anyone that had ever used Uniswap — even once.\n\nDistinct from liquidity mining, this is something new. Imagine if AirBnB or Uber had given 15% of their equity to early hosts, drivers, and users. Crypto protocols like Uniswap are experimenting with new models, that blur the lines between user and owner. What would the world be like, if our most valuable marketplaces were owned by the people who use them?\n\n**4. Bitcoin gets a new life as a wrapped token on Ethereum.** A Bitcoin is “wrapped” when it is locked somewhere (into a [protocol like TBTC](https://tbtc.network/), or by a custodian like [BitGo](https://wbtc.network/)), and then an IOU token is issued on Ethereum, which can be redeemed back on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nWhy are Bitcoin holders moving their Bitcoin onto Ethereum? Because on Ethereum, you can do things with your Bitcoin besides hold it. You can use your Bitcoin as collateral for a loan, or lend it out and earn interest on it. At the beginning of the year there were about 1,000 wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum, and [by November there were \\~154,000](https://defipulse.com/btc), nearly 1% of the total Bitcoin supply, being [put to work on Ethereum.](https://defipulse.com/btc)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*GzJi1gdZ4mIgTMxvcIwmrg.png)\n\n## 4. Ethereum’s Scaling Upgrades\n\nAfter years of research, planning, development, and testing, the Ethereum community laid the foundation for the [multi-year, multi-step Eth2 upgrades](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/).\n\nThis marks the beginning of a new phase. Over the next few years, the Ethereum community plans to make multiple inter-dependent upgrades to the core protocol, radically expanding the capacity and security of the network.\n\n**You’ve probably heard this project referred to as “[Eth2](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/)”, but this has always been a bad name**. “Eth1” and “Eth2” are not sequential versions of a thing, but rather two components of a whole — Ethereum — that will be merged together. The broader project is really a set of separate, but related, upgrades. The first of these upgrades — the Beacon chain — launched on December 1, 2020.\n\n## The beacon chain goes live\n\n**The [beacon chain](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/beacon-chain/) is the backbone of Ethereum’s new Proof of Stake consensus mechanism.** Today, the beacon chain isn’t being used by the Ethereum protocol — it’s just running smoothly, while the community fine-tunes and hardens it, in preparation for supporting a hundred-billion dollar network.\n\n**Ethereum’s Proof of Stake consensus system is unique.** No other blockchain community has prioritized decentralization — the ability for anyone, even with consumer hardware, to run a node — to the same degree as Ethereum.\n\nWhat happens next? There are two major tasks in the near future. One is to merge the Eth1 chain with Eth2, swapping out Proof of Work for the beacon chain’s Proof of Stake. The other, is to add data shards, which will open a new route to immediate scalability through rollups.\n\n## A rollup-centric roadmap\n\nIn October, Vitalik proposed [an adjustment to Ethereum’s roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698). This plan would prioritize expanding use of [rollups](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) to give the Ethereum ecosystem massive scalability gains in the near future.\n\n**Rollups are a layer 2 scaling technology.** The idea is that we can keep *data* on-chain, while moving execution “off-chain”, to an environment that can handle faster performance, while still preserving the characteristic safety guarantees of “on-chain” Ethereum transactions. For a detailed explanation, check out [Vitalik’s guide](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html).\n\n**The key to the rollup-centric roadmap is that rollups become even *more* powerful when combined with a specific Eth2 upgrade: data shards.** Data shards allow anyone to pay transaction fees to post data to several different sharded chains. Today (without data shards) rollups give Ethereum a 3000 transaction per second throughput capacity, but with data shards that throughput reaches more than 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nWe have rollups live on mainnet today (though they don’t yet use Eth2 data shards). [Loopring](https://loopring.io/), [Fuel](https://fuel.sh/) and [zkysnc](https://zksync.io/) already have ETH and token transfers enabled. All are capable of doing thousands of transactions per second with similar security assumptions as transacting on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\n2020 also saw optimistic rollups launch testnets with Solidity/EVM support. In 2021, we will see developers begin to port their applications to optimistic rollups (in fact, this blog post is late enough that we’ve [already begun to see it](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/mainnet-soft-launch-7cacc0143cd5)). As a result, transaction fees for end users will be lower, even as demand for Ethereum blockspace continues to grow.\n\nIf you want to read more about how Rollups fit into Ethereum’s roadmap, we recommend [this recent post by Ben Edgington](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/90818/ethereum-2-eth2-whats-next-2021).\n\n## The hobbyist staker community grows\n\n**As the beacon chain launch grew closer, a community of hobbyist stakers grew up around it.** This is a direct result of the Ethereum community’s decision to prioritize a PoS consensus mechanism that made it viable to participate with consumer hardware.\n\nCommunities like this *used* to exist in the early days of PoW mining, before ASICs centralized mining in the hands of large companies. Readers who were around in 2014–2016 will remember that being able to contribute to the network’s consensus on an *individual basis* was an important part of the crypto ethos, which has since been mostly lost. Now, Ethereum is bringing it back.\n\nIt’s another example of what makes the Ethereum community great. There was a need for education, resources, and tech support to help people learn how to set up their clients and stake successfully. The largest of these communities is [Ethstaker](http://ethstaker.cc/), a community of about 6,000 people on [Discord](http://invite.gg/ethstaker). If you’re interested in staking, this is the right place to start.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*GzJi1gdZ4mIgTMxvcIwmrg.png)\n\n## What did it all mean?\n\n \n Ethereum is growing up.\n\n**Ethereum’s digital frontier is no longer an experiment, no longer a blank canvass.** It’s an economy, a growing city-state. Still rough around the edges, sure. But that’s always been part of the charm.\n\n**Since 2015, Ethereum has always been the underdog.** But 5 years later, it’s the protocol with the largest volume and the most valuable blockspace. There are still other metrics to conquer — but you can feel the Ethereum community’s goals expanding beyond simple comparisons to digital gold.\n\nBeing the most-used cryptocurrency isn’t worth much if crypto itself fails, if it doesn’t solve real problems, or if it can’t scale. Ethereum’s next challenges will be bigger, because they will be the whole crypto market’s challenges.\n\n**So, what are you waiting for?** Winter is over, and we’ve got work to do. The frontier doesn’t build itself.\n\n— *Josh Stark & Evan Van Ness*\n\n*Thank you to George Trotter, Jacob Horne, Mike Winkelmann, Superphiz, Richard Chen, and Danny Ryan.*", "timestamp": 1635108122, "digest": "ywsx9-AsGR83LOyRUdDx2NpfaLEQdS0lKxHpHYwvzTI", "contributor": "0x4aa9C5546BE68486c4eF264a230D25674a1A728e"}

The collateral determines your interest rate.\n*   Teju can swap her MIM in the MIM3pool into USDT.\n*   Teju can return the borrowed MIM plus interest at any time and get back her collateral.\n\nTeju has about $9000 to play with, she can either buy other tokens, deposit to increase her yield, or do a lot other of creative stuffs with it and the best part of it is, as long as Teju control her collateral ratio and risk, there is little danger of her getting liquidated.\n\nAbracadabra money enables you to put to use capital that wouldn’t have been put to use otherwise.\n\nAbracadabra money has two tokens, MIM and Spell.\n\n## MIM (Magic Internet Money)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/400/1\\*o2bgAmFPgKl8zuMJODpwag.png)\n\nMIM\n\nMagic internet money(MIM) is a stablecoin that is backed by interest bearing tokens.\n\nFor a user to borrow MIM they need to deposit an interest bearing token.\n\nThe peg of MIM to the USD is maintained using arbitrage.\n\nMIM aims to be a true decentralized, multichain stablecoin.\n\nFor a truly decentralized internet we need true decentralized stable coins, the current market leaders USDT and USDC are very centralized and constantly coming under scrutiny by regulators.\n\nThe other alternative DAI by MakerDAO, has become more reliant on USDC, a centralized stablecoin.\n\nSquirrel, one of the Abracadabra team members, has this to say about DAI “DAI has become a very unattractive stablecoin. We were fans when it was Ethereum-collateralized, but at this stage, DAI is 60% collateralized by USDC. A supposedly decentralized stablecoin that is primarily collateralized by a centralized stablecoin, it’s ridiculous”\n\n1 DAI is currently backed by:\n\nUSDC — $0.45\n\nETH — $0.36\n\nWBTC — $0.08\n\nPAX — $0.06\n\nThe rest of the coins represent $0.05 of the total backing.\n\nMIM is already a multi-chain stablecoin, by leveraging Anyswap cross chain protocol, users can already transfer their MIM across chains.\n\nNew MIM tokens are minted by a [multisign](https://twitter.com/MIM_Spell/status/1401478828116123648), deposited in the kashi markets smart contracts, and then injected into circulation only after the user deposits the collaterals.\n\nMIM is in a unique position to capture the market, it’s the first collateralized stable coin and Along with UST, the two leading decentralized stablecoins, and we need true decentralized stablecoins moving forward.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*nWCkfS2yh7aMTDSnCgLKnA.png)\n\nTop stablecoins | Source: [Thedefiant.io](http://thedefiant.io/)\n\n## SPELL TOKEN\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/400/1\\*XG8V-hPEnHOcLKnNTaD1DQ.png)\n\nSpell\n\n**SPELL**\n\nSPELL token is the governance and incentive token of the abracadabra protocol.\n\nIt is used to incentivize users to provide liquidity into Abracadabra in order to earn yield.\n\nIt also grants holders voting rights and governance to change the platform parameters such as future collateral options, liquidation fees, and Total value locked (TVL).\n\nSingle side stakers of spell also get to share from the fees generated by the protocol, spell stakers receive up to 75% of the interest payments of the protocols loans via SPELL tokens that are rewarded to the stakers.\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\nInitially there was a total supply of 420 Billion, but it was reduced by 50 percent by performing a unique token burn event. Therefore Spell has a Max supply of 210 Billion.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*ZtPTsIMDnWkVBI9Tj3-49A.png)\n\nSpell token Distribution | Source: [Abracadabra.Money](http://abracadabra.money/)\n\nSPELL tokens are distributed as follows:\n\n*   63% will be used to incentivize Liquidity providers and other liquidity mining programs.\n*   7% was distributed at IDO\n*   30% of the total supply was allocated to team members and has a 4 years vesting schedule.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*O00RImeHo9T3ek0uHcV3GA.png)\n\nTeam tokens Vesting Schedule\n\nSPELL currently has a circulating supply of 59.23 Billion.\n\nSPELL has surged to over a Billion dollars market cap and they are already generating more revenue than MakerDAO, despite MakerDAO having a bigger market cap.\n\nSPELL generated $2,366,00 in fees last week, while MakerDAO generated $1,192,921.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*wmLoeXSFY9s35IkXcTKfqA.png)\n\nSPELL VS MKR | Source: [byebyedai](http://byebyedai.money/)\n\n**Roadmap And Future plans**\n\nThe abracadabra money team are constantly building and they are coming after DAI and the other centralized stablecoins, Stablecoins like USDT, USDC and BUSD comprise of about $133 Billion in circulation and with the regulators constantly haggling USDT and USDC in particular, there is a big addressable market for MIM, and demand for decentralized stablecoins will only increase, recently Abracadabra team are planning to Partner with the Terra team(UST), in order to compete together against centralized stablecoins.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*oCFTaLViPjH7RlkwryBSvg.png)\n\nMIM meets UST\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe frog nation community and the “DeFi 2.0” crowds are also behind SPELL and MIM, and they are building a powerful community and the demand for decentralized stablecoins will only increase, The team builds fast, have a great community and the future looks bright for Abracadabra money.\n\nI will leave you with a spell book.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/370/1\\*zdfUnl7vZLUJ\\_4u3Rr_BqA.png)\n\nCast a SPELL\n\n***Disclaimer:**** This article is intended for educational and informational purposes only, and should not be construed as investment or financial advice.*\n", "timestamp": 1635109283, "digest": "8tMCg73Z7Jdzlq1JngRBDUu8XQFzflgtKOaD9-abFrM", "contributor": "0xceeEEBDAe2d18F7987756fb905B66A676e58869E"}
{"id": "2LqsJYb_KEW8WYrkicJOBP98Bv54m8SF_gXxymDEEFA", "title": "The Death Rite", "body": "Andrei had been murdered. Fourteen hours ago, his family vowed to figure out who killed him, and take their revenge by sunrise. They now had six hours remaining to make good on that vow…\n\n\\*\n\nThe village that Andrei’s family called home had sustained a death rite for over three hundred years. When a resident of the village died, the family would carry the body from house to house – visiting all the friends, family, and loved ones of the deceased. At each stop, a toast would be made in honor of the recently passed, they would all share stories and reminisce fondly, and then, with the deceased in tow, the family would move on to the next house, repeating the process until dawn. Once the sun rose, they would deliver the departed to the gravesite and lie them to final rest.\n\nSo it had gone, for as long as anyone could recall, this death rite played out in all its hoary theatricality. No one questioned it- in fact, everyone enjoyed it… for it provided yet another reason to drink and socialize; acts which carried much weight in small villages comprised of close-knit, working-class folk. Working-class folk just like Andrei’s family who now undertook this rite with ulterior motives at heart- drinking and talking with suspect after suspect.\n\n**Emil**\n\nAndrei’s father, Emil, a woodworker, was the type of man that suffered in silence at all times. His lot, the lot of others – all suffering – was taken as equal and he never attempted to sort any of it out. He was content with a warm fire and a stiff drink, a proud day’s work done, his children around a table, nourished by what he had provided – all was equal. He was confident that his small anxieties, aches, and pains, did not amount to much in the grand scheme.\n\nNever allowing himself to get upset over things obviously out of his control, his life had always maintained a placid equilibrium. It was this staid mode of daily ritual that afforded him his peace, his pride, and his contentment. This is why the sudden and violent death of his son had shaken him so badly. He felt pangs of intense guilt, as if faced with the sudden, frightening realization that he had somehow taken him for granted. Even though he spent ample time with his son and loved him dearly, he felt as though he could have, in the end, done more to excite his passions – to provide him opportunities to flourish and discover himself in ways that Emil never had cared to explore throughout his own life.\n\n**Gabriel**\n\nAndrei’s older brother, Gabriel, had taken a different tack in life. Inspired by his father’s void of distinctive passions, he had thrown himself into the arts at an early age. He was adept at painting and writing especially – and he managed to make a serviceable living for himself utilizing those skills. True, he lived a bohemian existence, yet it suited him well. He enjoyed drink and debate. He was a passionate, overtly virile man, well known in town for having bedded more than his fair share of beautiful women. Despite it all, he was humble at heart, kind and always willing to help others in any way he was able.\n\nGabriel had moved out of the main house many years ago, yet still lived on the family land, helping with upkeep and always being present for weekly family dinners. Those nights by the fire with his father, his mother and Andrei were very special to him.\n\nThey had never had much, they were not extravagant folk, but they had supported each other at any turn their lives took. Drinking those stiff drinks and eagerly maintaining the fire with thick, seasoned wood while the family spoke without egoism, without fear of judgment, were the most genuine emotional experiences of Gabriel’s life. He truly had a home - he had that fire in his spine and it could never be extinguished by the outside world. His family had made him who he was and he was grateful with all the sincerity in his heart. When he heard about Andrei’s death, a part of him shattered irreconcilably. He was sick, he was in shock, and then, all was anger. That fire in his spine flared up and consumed him with an unfamiliar, hateful ferocity when he saw his baby brother lying on a bloodied sheet with his skull bashed in.     \n\n**Tereza**\n\nTereza was the center of the family, the soul that informed the body. All compassion and all empathy had sprung from her and been planted, not only into her husband, who she married at a young age, but also into her sons. She had led them through life with a strong sense of purpose. Whatever the boys were interested in she encouraged them to throw themselves into it with abandon. She was always fond of telling them, “Live with your heart, simply love what you do and you will always be doing what you love”. It seemed an undemanding platitude, but it registered deep within both boys. Gabriel saw it as a clear, existentialist celebration of the artist’s communion with a muse, while Andrei saw it as a calling to develop a profound spiritual connection to nature and the small works, which filled you with humor and fondness for the silent beauties found in all corners of life. Both boys were right, after all, it was plainly a call to arms – a rally to not miss the opportunities to know yourself - to care for yourself, and therein, to care for the world. Tereza ignited enthusiasms the boys themselves were unaware they possessed, and so, possessed they became. Repeatedly changing and evolving, continuously adding new threads to the rich tapestries of their life experience.\n\nOut of all the family members, Tereza was the strongest. Yet, now when they were faced with this sudden death, that strength became her greatest weakness. She had developed such reverence and respect for her sons by seeing her own strength reflected back in their personalities, that the idea of one of them no longer being by her side was simply absurd. It had never even crossed her mind as a possibility – to outlive your own child! Nonsense! Ridiculous nonsense! However, it was now a reality, and it was too much for her to comprehend.\n\nTereza had not cried, she had not yet fallen to her knees and sobbed that guttural animal sob that only the unluckiest amongst us have heard shred a human being’s vocal chords. All she had done when she heard the news was drop a pitcher of milk, her hands went slack and the pitcher disappeared from her grasp, as if it were jumping into the oppressive oblivion, which seemed to envelope everything around her. She collapsed into a nearby chair and as the men in the room talked, yelled, spit, and cursed, she stared at the jagged shards of glass and the white liquid, hearing no detail. She reflexively felt compelled to drop down to her knees and clean the mess up, but the very idea of actually doing it made her want to scream and vomit at the same time.\n\nAfter a long while, Tereza finally stood to focus on the room. Her face drained of color, whiter than that milk, an alabaster void. Emil and Gabriel rushed to her side, ready to comfort her, yet she only needed one thing: an answer. Her voice was hoarse and monotone, “Who killed my boy?”\n\n**The Death Rite**\n\nFor as steeped in tradition as this entire act was, it was ironic that the commencement of the death rite had no specific ritual attached to it. You simply and unceremoniously started walking to the houses you desired to visit.\n\nGabriel and Emil each held one end of the makeshift stretcher, which they had cobbled together out of a few blankets, and some wooden poles they salvaged from an old barn earlier in the season. It was crude, but they had no other option on such short notice. It would have to suffice, because they could not devote any more time to delays; people were expecting them.\n\nTheir first stop would be the Gregor house. Marta and Hamish Gregor were the parents of two children the same ages as Gabriel and Andrei. Their daughter, Sara, had been Andrei’s sweetheart. The two had only been dating for a month, but Andrei seemed quite taken with the plainspoken girl. He was always running off to be with her, always buying her trinkets. Emil and Tereza had seen it with other girls before and they had always expected to see it again with still other girls. However, in this case, fate had now created a lifelong bond between these people.\n\nHamish must have been watching through the window because he opened the door before Emil knocked. “Come in... dear Father in heaven, come in out of the cold with your boy.”\n\nTereza, Emil and Gabriel entered the house, the two men carrying Andrei’s body on the stretcher. Marta and Hamish both stood over Andrei’s body, heads bowed, silently reciting a prayer. Hamish placed his hand on Andrei’s forehead and told him to be at peace.\n\n“We’re sorry for your loss, Andrei was a wonderful person. We didn’t know him for very long, but we quickly grew to love him.”\n\nHamish motioned over to a large blanket on the floor – this was customary. When the deceased’s body was brought into a house, you would lie them down in order to drink around them. You would never lay the body directly on the floor; there would always be some sort of blanket, some makeshift bed, something available to cradle the body before it was set into the earth for eternity.\n\n Hamish had drinks pre-poured and he placed a glass in everyone’s hand. Hamish raised his glass in toast, “To Andrei, a perfect gentleman and a lovely addition to our extended family, who was taken from us all too soon.”    \n\n  Everyone downed their drinks and Marta quickly passed in front of the crowd, re-filling the glasses. Marta then gave a toast. “To Andrei: a young man who made our daughter Sara sing with happiness. May God bless his soul as he sits beside Him in heaven for all eternity.”\n\nAgain, everyone downed their glasses and again Marta promptly refilled them. This continued for an hour, until Hamish suggested they go see Sara.\n\n“Poor Sara is devastated, as you can imagine. She loved dear Andrei so intensely. You should visit her after you leave us. You can take a shortcut there if you go the back way from our house and cut across the field. Keep north for two kilometers and you will come to the tree line directly behind her house.”\n\nEmil stood and shook Hamish’s hand. “Thank you, Hamish, thank you for your warming condolences. We will go and see Sara straight away.”\n\nGabriel and Tereza both gave their thanks as well, and then Emil and his only remaining son hoisted Andrei up from the floor and started toward Sara’s house. Tereza took the lead holding a lantern aloft to create a narrow beam of light they could follow through the grey and white woods.\n\nIt had snowed heavily the previous day and the walk to Sara’s house took much longer than they had anticipated. Crunching through the deep snow was hypnotic to Gabriel. The sounds of cracking through the surface of the frozen covering, their boots sinking into the powder underneath and the sucking sound of pulling them out looped ceaselessly. They did not stop to rest.\n\nEmil broke the numbing ambience of their trip, “Sara’s parents are nice people.”\n\nGabriel scoffed, “They’re ostentatious.”\n\n“How’s that, Gabe?” Emil asked.\n\n “Every story they shared about Andrei centered around them somehow, what *they* were doing *for* Andrei – how generous and how kind they were to take Andrei there, to show him this, to give him that... it was grotesque. It was exasperating to bear their thinly veiled tales of self-aggrandizing shit. I wanted to spit up their drinks onto the floor, I was sick at the idea of having to accept anything they were offering me.” Gabriel explained.\n\nEmil stared ahead into the dim void of snow and trees, “You are very perceptive, Gabriel.”\n\nThey came to a clearing in the woods and the snow on the ground was disturbed, numerous footprints and wheel marks from carriages decorated the surroundings. Gabriel stopped in his tracks, “Mother, wait. This is where they found his body.”\n\nTereza directed her lantern light onto the scenery. The family stood in place and contemplated the disturbed snow. The location was sickeningly ordinary - just a random section of woods, nothing special. Gabriel had no good cause to be upset that his brother’s body was not dumped somewhere more spectacular, yet for some reason it stoked his anger. “Someone just left him out here to be picked over by animals.”\n\nEmil placed his hand on Gabriel’s shoulder, “We still have a long night ahead of us, we should keep moving. It’s getting colder.”\n\nThey soon came upon Sara’s house. Since they had taken the shortcut, they approached the small house from behind. Gabriel noticed a wheelbarrow with no significant amount of snow accumulated upon its surface, its bright red color cutting through the grey and white wash of the winter night. Every surface that could hold it had at least two or three inches of snow piled upon it, except for that wheelbarrow. There were tire tracks and footprints leading around to the front of the house and out to the tree line. For some reason, the whole scene struck Gabriel as odd and it nagged at him.\n\nTereza knocked, yet there was no answer, she knocked again – still no answer. The firelight danced behind the curtained window and it certainly seemed like someone was home. Gabriel shifted his weight, holding the makeshift stretcher with one hand and quickly and loudly pounded his fist upon the door. Finally, Sara opened it.\n\n“Oh, dear family... come, bring my sweet Andrei in.” Sara motioned for them to enter and held the door open wide. There was a pile of laundry sitting on the floor and a large pot of water, simmering over the fire inside. “I was just preparing to clean the dishes, but that can wait.” Sara looked the family over giving a consolatory frown to each person, one by one. She hugged Emil first, then Tereza and finally came to Gabriel. “Gabriel, he loved you so much, you were his best friend in the world, how distraught you must be.”\n\n“I am.” Gabriel replied, “We’ve just come from your parent’s house. Do you have drinks?”\n\nSara looked confused, and then it dawned on her, “The death rite, of course. I have only experienced it once, when I was a very young girl, please excuse my ignorance. Let me bring you all something to warm you on this viciously cold night. You can place dear, Andrei there.” She pointed to a large table near the fireplace.\n\nAs Sara procured the glasses and a bottle, Gabriel noticed that nowhere in her cramped little kitchen area were there any dirty dishes. “I thought you said you were preparing to clean the dishes, yet I see none piled about.”\n\n“Gabriel!” Tereza barked, “it is no concern of ours how a lady keeps her own house.”\n\nSara raised her hand in protest, “Oh, dear Mother, it is quite all right. Gabriel - and all of us – are deeply fraught with confusion and pain right now. All of our heads are spinning trying to make sense of this day. What I meant to say was that I had just finished cleaning the dishes as you knocked upon the door. I’m going to launder my linens now”\n\nGabriel scoffed, “Those fraught with pain rarely see to banal chores.”\n\n“Gabriel, please do not think ill of me, I only do this banal work to occupy my mind. I feel the mourning process overcoming me and I’m not as strong as you, I need to attempt to hide away and misdirect the painful emotions I feel.” Sara handed Gabriel a glass of liquor and continued, “This will be difficult for us all”\n\nGabriel took the drink and downed it in one gulp. Sara handed Emil and Tereza their drinks and then refilled Gabriel’s glass. Once again, Gabriel downed his immediately. That fire in his spine was flaring up again.\n\n“Who killed my brother, Sara?” Gabriel stared her down and she looked away.\n\n“I wish I knew,” Sara replied, “so that the vile beast may be brought to swift justice.”\n\nGabriel waved his glass at Sara and she refilled it again. “When did you last see him?”\n\nSara thought this over for a bit, then, “It was yesterday afternoon, he came by for lunch. We ate and then my brother stopped by to see me. Dear, I...” Sara trailed off.\n\n“What is it?” Emil approached Sara and softly inquired. “You seem as though you’ve just thought of something.”\n\n“Well,” Sara started, “it’s probably nothing, but I just had a horrid thought. You see, my brother, Anton had always found himself at odds with poor Andrei. For some unknown reason, there was great tension between the two of them. Yesterday, when Anton stopped by, he and Andrei seemed to be continuing an argument they had started some time before. They were both exceptionally upset. They began pushing each other, and as I stepped in between them to act as peacekeeper, Anton shouted that he wanted to... Oh, I cannot even say it... it is too terrible.  \n\nEmil placed a gentle hand on Sara’s shoulder, “Go ahead, Sara. What did Anton say?”\n\nSara looked to Tereza, as if she was afraid to say it in her presence. “He said... ‘I’m going to bash your skull in’ and Andrei replied saying he wished he would try. I was not able to calm them down and Anton stormed out, shortly thereafter, Andrei left, saying he was going home. That was the last time anyone saw him. I told you – it is too terrible to think of! My dear brother could not have done such a thing... could he?”\n\nGabriel snatched the bottle from the table and began to drain it without bothering to pour it into his glass first. Tereza, tried to pull the bottle away from him, yet Gabriel angrily snapped it away from her feeble grasp. Emil shot Gabriel a look that shamed him, yet it was not enough to cut through the inebriated fog he was determined to shroud himself within. If the death rite called for him to drink, he would do just that. He would honor his brother in any way he could. For now though, his mind raced with images of Anton smashing Gabriel’s head in. Slurring his words, he spat out the question - “Where does Anton live?”\n\nSara was happy to provide the information, “Right off of the lake, on the north side, in the small house that has a broken dock. However, please, Gabriel – do not jump to conclusions. Perhaps you should talk to the rest of the people you plan to visit, see if anything comes to light. Give yourself some time to think and calm down.”\n\n“I’m perfectly calm!” Gabriel shouted, “I’m simply trying to mourn my brother. We should go now.”\n\nEmil grabbed the bottle from Gabriel and set it back down, out of his reach. He stood and embraced Sara in a hug, “Thank you for your hospitality, my dear. We will see you at the burial, I’m sure.”\n\nSara thanked Emil and then pulled Teresa into a hug, “Dear, Mother, please take care.”\n\nTereza nodded politely, yet said nothing in return.\n\nSara implored Gabriel, “Gabriel, please, grant my brother the benefit of doubt... the poor soul has had enough trouble in his life.” \n\nWith that, Emil and Gabriel picked up the stretcher and they all headed back out into the cold dim, grey.\n\nAfter Sara shut the door she returned to the pile of linens piled up against the wall. She opened a tightly bound sheet to reveal a mess of dried blood, and a large, cast-iron ladle with bits of skin and hair stuck to it. She placed the ladle into the pot of boiling water over the fire, then balled the sheets together and threw them onto the logs. Turning everything over onto itself with the poker, she stoked the flames and watched the sheets burn away to ashes. She grabbed the nearby bottle of liquor and took a long draw.   \n\n**Lex talionis**\n\nThe family visited four other houses in quick succession, drinking and sharing rushed pleasantries, all the while making their way closer to the lake. Luca K. and Stefan R. both spoke of a public argument between Andrei and Anton they had witnessed a few days prior. Others also spoke about a rift between the two; it seemed to be common gossip amongst those who knew both parties. Some even suggested a twisted love triangle between Sara, her brother and Andrei. Gabriel’s anger grew as he continued to drink and as they went along with the tradition, so too did Tereza and Emil begin to succumb to darker thoughts as the alcohol took control of their emotions. Eventually, they exhausted their acquaintances and had visited everyone they could think of that knew Andrei. Now, well drunk, they found themselves at the lakefront and Gabriel pointed out the house with the broken dock. “That’s where the bastard lives.” He began charging ahead, almost yanking Emil along on the other end of the stretcher. Emil pulled back and asked Gabriel to stop.\n\n“Gabriel, we must think this through, we cannot just go charging into his house.” Emil implored Tereza, with a look to help him convince Gabriel. She offered no such support.\n\nTereza looked at Emil blankly, “I think we should confront him while we have the chance.”\n\nGabriel grinned and tugged at the stretcher, “I agree with Mother, let’s see what he does when we show up unannounced.”\n\nThe house was dark – the sun would be up soon and Anton was surely sound asleep. They approached and Gabriel handed his end of the stretcher to Tereza, and then opened the front door as quietly as he could. They entered the house and saw Anton, asleep in his small bed in front of a dying fire. Tereza and Emil set the stretcher down on a table and all three family members stood over Anton as he slept. Gabriel picked up a hammer from the mantle and stood over Anton, turning the tool over in his hand and looking at the red glow it reflected from the smoldering coals in the fireplace. The red of the coals made Gabriel think of splitting Anton’s skull open while he slept, yet, he resisted. He wanted Anton to know exactly what was coming and why, he wanted him to look into the faces of his father and mother and see Andrei lying on the stretcher so that he was forced to bear witness to the family he had destroyed. Gabriel gave Anton a sharp kick in the ribs and he woke in a start, clutching his side and wincing in pain. \n\nGabriel stood over him, hammer in hand, “Good morning, Anton. I hope you do not mind that we let ourselves in. We need to talk...”\n\nAnton looked into the faces surrounding him –disoriented by sleep, he still was not fully conscious of the situation.\n\nGabriel grabbed Anton by his nightshirt and pulled him up into a sitting position, he waved the hammer in front of his face, “You need to tell us about your relationship with Andrei.”\n\nAnton looked over and saw the stretcher, it all made a sudden horrible sense to him. “Oh, God... Andrei. I... I never touched him.”\n\n“According to everyone we have spoken with, including your sister, you and Andrei had a highly strained relationship. Some may say, violent.” Gabriel swung the hammer in an arc toward Anton, stopping short of connecting with his head, to punctuate the word ‘violent’. “What did you use to bash his skull in?” Gabriel felt dizzy and he could tell he was slurring his words; the alcohol in his system had taken full control. It was too warm in Anton’s house and it smelled sour. Gabriel felt sick and wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.\n\nAnton raised his hands in surrender, “I did not harm, Andrei. It was my sister, was it not, who planted this notion in your mind?”\n\nEmil leaned forward to answer, “We talked with your sister – and many others. Everyone spoke of an irate tension between you and Andrei. The implication is clear.”\n\nAnton began to panic, “I promise you, it is manufactured. Sara created the rift between Andrei and I. On more than one occasion I attempted to broach the subject with him, yet the fiction that Sara had created for Andrei to hear had taken hold and he dismissed me angrily. It is true, we argued in public, yet it was only because I was desperate to work out the misunderstanding between us.”\n\n“You had clear motive and Andrei never had any other enemies, it is as plain as can be. You killed my brother,” Gabriel grabbed Anton’s shirt and shook him like a rag doll.\n\n“No! This is my sister’s undertaking! Sara has always harbored a sick fascination with me and when she takes suitors into her life, she attempts to create a rift between them and I. She wants me to fight with them; she wants them to hate me because she cannot bring herself to do so. She tells them terrible, deceptive things about me and then goads them to confront me. This has occurred repeatedly, ever since we were children – her, setting her friends against me out of malicious jealousy.”\n\n“Jealousy born from what?” Emil inquired.\n\n“She is incensed at my ability to see her as a sibling and not as a woman. Sara is not right in her mind... she has professed her love for me since she was a child. Through the years, this twisted view has only grown more perverted and repulsive. She throws herself at me and when I reject her advances, she creates horrid situations such as this as a form of punishment.”\n\n“I have heard enough! You are the sick one, blaming your sister for Andrei’s death – how despicable. As if a small woman could overpower my brother and crush his skull with such force!” Gabriel pointed toward Andrei’s body on the stretcher, “His head was caved in by a man; *a cowardly man*, one who brashly attempts to place culpability onto a woman instead of admitting his transgression. The jury has reached a verdict, Anton – you have been found guilty.” Gabriel raised the hammer to the heavens.\n\nEmil lunged at Anton, wrapping his arms around him and holding him tightly in a bear hug as Gabriel struck him on the crown of his head. He hit him three times in quick succession, snapping the hammer back and forth as if he were driving a nail into a board.\n\nTereza cried out and grabbed Gabriel’s arm, “Stop! I believe him.” However, it was too late. Anton slumped back onto his bed, his head wet and misshapen. Tereza sobbed and Emil stood over Anton’s body with a sudden look of confusion flushed across his face. Gabriel felt sick, he rushed out the door and into the cold.\n\nHunched over, with his hands on his knees, Gabriel heaved in and out, trying to keep himself from being sick. The world spun, and watching his hot breath spew into the frigid air, he felt as though he was trying to purge abstruse demons from within his body.\n\nEmil approached him from behind, “Gabriel, what have we done? Your mother continues to suggest that Anton was telling the truth and that we have made a terrible mistake.” Gabriel said nothing, Emil pushed. “You yourself had an awful impression of Sara - could it be, Gabriel? Could Anton have been innocent of what we accused him?”\n\n**Poenitentia**\n\nIt had been three days since the family had buried Andrei... three days since they stumbled out of that lake house in a daze, carrying Andrei’s body through the encroaching morning light to the cemetery... three days since they rolled Anton’s corpse off the broken dock and into the lake.\n\nThe news around town was that Anton had been found murdered; his body washed up on the east shore, his head beaten in. People suggested there was a killer on the loose, the same killer who had murdered Andrei in similar fashion. Gabriel, Emil and Tereza knew better, yet they made no mention of it. That night, they congregated in front of the fire at Emil and Tereza’s house in silence. Their usual proclivity for discussion muted by shared truths too awful to speak, the shared regret of actions that smothered every other topic in their lives. Their youngest son was dead, and now, due to their inability to accept the unjust nature of life, the family that remained was dead as well. They had violated their world and now nothing could ever return to the way it was before.\n\nGabriel could no longer endure suffering in silence with his, now, unfamiliar family. After a few drinks the unspoken communion was too much to bear, so he decided to leave and avoid the distressing situation altogether.\n\nGabriel went into town, bought a bottle of fine liquor and set it on a tray near his front door with four glasses. He also placed Anton’s hammer, which he had kept, on the tray as well. Then he made a fire and sat in front of it, idly poking and turning the logs while the sky changed colors as hours ticked away.\n\nLate that night, as Gabriel sat awake, there was a knock at the door. It was Anton’s family, carrying his body in tow. Anton’s brother, father and mother were obviously, quite drunk. Sara was not with them. Gabriel welcomed them into the house, shut the door, and presented the tray. “I’m sorry for your loss...”", "timestamp": 1635109386, "digest": "eqA3rnCoUaQI3WEriiKXSu35pczCkkYfZx1I9zx6WDU", "contributor": "0xaf9c2D4aD2055bA72f117533F1ecd2173d399aAE"}

Group trauma can lead to distorted thinking, which often manifests as internalized oppression, as people try to maintain some sense of misplaced control over the circumstances of their oppression. In addition, trauma from long-stranding oppression can leave the group huddled together in a form of stagnated solidarity. When anyone tries to move beyond the place of suffering that the group has occupied, they are attacked by the group and brought back down (Mitchell 56).\n\nWhen layered a top a large population of people already traumatized from the long term impacts of climate crisis and the kleptocracy-capitalism hybrid many of us are navigating along with massive inequality and economic disruption, **it’s no wonder why massive portions of the population are clinging to disinformation that makes them feel empowered over their own lives.** It’s no wonder that identity politics have now reached full scale destruction.\n\n![Stop the Bans protest in Wilmington, NC 2019.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f_nOlArZpYK3BlHyXJ3pc.jpg?height=2000&width=3000)\n\nAs a society, **we’re succumbing to weaponized algorithms willingly as a means of escape** and as a way to feel a sense of solidarity by supporting conspiracies that restore a feeling of agency through a collective enemy that is responsible for the individual’s pain. Mass conspiracies thrive in such an environment of group trauma by providing a means of mutual belief and connection.\n\nAt a very young age, we are taught in western society to ignore our pain and muscle through. We’re taught that pain is weakness and that to feel and express emotions is not something that strong, independent people do. We’re taught that to survive in this world we must “pull ourselves up by our bootstraps” and suffer through whatever pain or trauma has been thrown at us over the span of our lifetimes. **We are taught to internalize the oppressor’s systems of control and blame ourselves for the inequalities baked into our societal fabrics.**\n\nAt a very young age we are taught to accept the means of oppression baked into our social structures and to never question the means or motives of the oppressor. **We accept the consumption based economy and the patriarchal laws as reality,** something we must accept and can not change or push back upon.

Bound together by a collective trauma, unaware of the manifestation of pain from that trauma and trying to navigate a system designed to oppress all of us into the acceptance of consumption and destruction as inevitable.\n\nOur societal programming has brought us to a precipice of destruction and if we do not recognize, explore and **accept our individual pain and our neighbor’s pain as valid and help one another process this global experience**, we will never move past the destruction and step into healing.\n\nWhat if we chose to no longer participate in such oppression or weaponized algorithms? What if we all stop, look around and acknowledge the trauma? What if we all lean into those quiet moments of fear and explore the emotion that is behind the fear itself? What if we take a time out and just feel the impacts of losing 700k countrymen and millions of global citizens? **What if we unplug from the weaponized algorithms, go out into our communities and simply talk to one another?**\n\n> The courage to feel pain is something that most of us are never taught. Instead, we learn to distract ourselves from it, insulate, and deflect. The irony is that pain cannot be avoided. When we attempt to avoid our pain, it hunts us down, becoming increasingly stealthy in its machinations...It disrupts our lives, torments our minds, and destroys our relationships (Mitchell 65).\n\nWhat if we **turn to the wisdom of the indigenous peoples** and incorporate their methods of community and healing into our systems now? What if we made healing the planet AND our communities a top priority rather than continuing to destroy our home in the name of economic growth?\n\n![Stop the Bans protests in Wilmington, NC 2019. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uBL5VsMoE8Fez8whiFbbs.jpg?height=2000&width=3000)\n\nWhat if we embraced our pain and began a journey to healing? Are we even capable of such a thing? Can we turn to the wisdom of ancient tribal communities who lived harmoniously with nature on this planet and employ their approach of balancing the masculine and feminine to restore our ability to survive on this planet and navigate the collective trauma of our present and the coming chaos of our immediate future?\n\nI believe we’re rapidly moving past the question of “can we?” We are now facing the reality that “we must.”\n\n**We must process our collective trauma.

This past week has had several major drops and a few little scandals, and for a few days we saw a lot of despair that NFTs were about to enter a bear market before Bitcoin claimed and then lost a new all-time high, leading to rallies across the board.\n\nLet's dive into some of the major events of the past week.\n\n\n---\n\n## Doodles\n\n![The launch went smoothly and the floor price is way up, but allegations of insider dealing have left a bad taste in the mouths of those who were unable to snag a Doodle on mint day.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VEK5NJanJmeEpyTFdMXPt.png?height=1800&width=1800)\n\nThe digital artist known as Burnt Toast dropped his much-anticipated \"Doodles\" 10k collection, minting for 0.123 ETH per item. As of the time of this writing, the floor is 1.35 ETH, meaning minters were able to claim at least a 10x return on investment within a single week! However, this mint was not without its controversies as the whitelist did not seem to be apportioned entirely equitably.

Many of you might have seen the term “DAO” before, but you’ve probably seen that term very recently. A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization, or essentially a club whose finances and operations exist on the blockchain, instead of via bank accounts.\n\nMany NFT projects are operating as DAOs, meaning you gain access to the organization by owning one of their NFTs, and one of the most popular NFT DAOs is CyberKongzBets (CKB), a play on the subreddit “WallStreetBets” famous for pumping the Gamestop and AMC stocks during an epic short squeeze earlier in 2021. CKB is a private Discord server for the owners of [CyberKongz](https://www.opensea.io/collection/cyberkongz) (see below), a pixelated ape PFP NFT. CKB is well-known in the NFT community for being home to many well-known traders and NFT flippers, and is closely watched by the broader NFT community to see what projects they are purchasing.\n\n![CyberKongz is well-known in the NFT community for having members with deep pockets and an affinity for finding quality PFP projects and \"sweeping the floors\" of upcoming projects in an attempt to make these projects more popular.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WjG6CxWcDQ2nOp0pc27M2.png?height=680&width=680)\n\nEarlier this month we saw the “Kongz,” as they are referred to, sweeping the floor of a few projects, notably [Bitbones](https://www.opensea.io/collectio/thefearface-bitbones) (see my profile picture for an example of a Bitbones). NFT wallet watchers keep track of Kongz’s activities and often try to chase those purchases to get in on the pump. While Kongz is not the only NFT DAO to do so, it is certainly one of the better-known projects.\n\nThis brings us to **RareBunniClub**, the most recent project that Kongz is suspected of coordinating large floor sweeps. Because RareBunni’s are not revealed yet, it is somewhat risky to purchase one pre-reveal, but if the Kongz have it their way this project could see a big pump post-reveal. Just be sure to take profits if you hold more than one, as we don’t know how the art will turn out!\n\n```\nRareBunniClub mint: 0.04 ETH\nPre-reveal floor: 0.09 ETH\nReveal date: Monday, 25 October (late evening, time TBA)\nPost-reveal long-term outlook: Decent to Good (2.5/5)\n```\n\n```\nCyberKongz mint: 0.01 ETH\nCurrent floor: 9.8 ETH\nLong-term outlook: Great to Outstanding (4.5/5)\n```\n\n\n---\n\n## HeadDAO\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6J5nB5XWbtZRTHcf9JdBP.png?height=320&width=320)\n\nSpeaking of NFT DAOs, another big project that launched this past week was [HeadDAO](https://www.opensea.io/collection/headdao), a new NFT project launched by 16 year old [Shamdoo.eth](https://www.twitter.com/TheShamdoo). Shamdoo is clearly a knowledgeable crypto-native even for his age, and has deftly created a sold-out project that quickly raised over 125 ETH to their treasury (coming from commissions of sales) with the purpose of using the community treasury to purchase valuable blue-chip NFT projects for community ownership.\n\nSuch a concept is not new, but for a 16 year old to lead thousands of internet strangers towards the goal of community ownership of quality digital art is pretty impressive. However, there’s a few things to discuss (this is where the scientist in me comes out) regarding some pitfalls of DAO ownership:\n\n* DAOs are *hard* to truly decentralized. If there’s a community treasury fund in control of a single individual (or small group of individuals) this is not a truly decentralized organization.\n* Decentralizing a DAO’s treasury requires some advanced cryptographic and programming knowledge, and DAO operations and politics can quickly scale to a high level of complexity. It’s important for DAOs to clearly define their goals, roles, and operations to avoid drama.\n* If somebody joins the DAO and later leaves, do they still retain partial ownership of the NFTs their royalties purchased? Most of the time the answer is no, and while I’m not advocating for reform, it’s important for people to realize that DAO membership doesn’t necessarily guarantee proportional ownership of the DAO’s assets.\n\nNow, for those that don’t know me I’m a grad student researcher at an academic institution for decentralization and blockchain research, therefore I often have some highly skeptical takes on certain concepts, and DAOs are my bread and butter. I’ve been studying them for almost 4 years and they’re still a very nascent technology. However, as the cryptosphere and metaverse continue to grow, DAOs will only become more popular over time.\n\n**Back to the project at hand,** HeadDAO minted for a cheap price of 0.055 ETH and is already at a floor of 0.58, providing a healthy 10x return for investors. Due to the DAO mechanics, the well-known persona of Shamdoo in the NFT space, and the desire for community in the metaverse, I anticipate HeadDAO to continue to grow in the short/medium term.\n\nTheir current shared assets include the following blue-chip NFTs:\n\n![CoolCat #5538 was acquired for 9.4 ETH](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E7ZbjUCiIz_J78ZCJMg9a.png?height=600&width=600)\n\n![These 3 CrypToadz were acquired for a total of 20.76 ETH](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RGTIPTYU640I3EBveFoGU.png?height=462&width=833)\n\n![This Genesis CyberKong (remember them?) was acquired for over 97 ETH!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NFvKBtJyfoqYEaVPajJb3.png?height=600&width=600)\n\nThis project is obviously going places, and with a floor of 0.58 this isn’t a bad opportunity to join the club and reap some of the profits!\n\n```\nHeadDAO mint price: 0.055 ETH\nCurrent floor: 0.58 ETH\nCurrent ROI: ~10x, or 900%\nLong-term outlook: Good to Great (3.5/5)\n```\n\n\n---\n\nI’m going to leave you here as I’m about to run to see a film this evening, so unfortunately I don’t have time to cover all of the amazing honorable mentions of the past week.

However, this mint was not without its controversies as the whitelist did not seem to be apportioned entirely equitably. Many notable Crypto Twitter influencers found themselves on the whitelists without having to jump through the same hoops that average users had to just to be whitelisted.\n\nThat being said, making a 10x ROI within a week while reaching 12.1k ETH volume is an indicator of a very strong launch and potentially a decent floor long-term. The question is, once the hype dies down will demand hold the floor steady, or will people take aggressive profits in chasing the next big mint? If it's the former, then that could be an indicator that NFT appreciation is still in full-swing, whereas if the floor drops out and the hype moves on, this could instead indicate frothiness in the market meaning that speculation is in full swing - indicating that the NFT market is in the later stages of a bubble.\n\nOf course, the success of one project doesn't make or break an entire market, but if we see massive floor pumps followed by equally massive dumps, that's a strong indication of pump-and-dump mentality of buyers, meaning a lack of long-term confidence may be preventing quality projects from sustaining their price floors.\n\nI'll be keeping my eye on Doodle, particularly because I love the pastel colors and art, and will be attempting to buy one around the 1 ETH mark. If it starts to take off again above 1.5 I may FOMO in just because I want one desperately for a backup PFP, but we'll have to see what the market dictates in the near future.\n\n```\nMint price: 0.123\nCurrent floor: 1.35\nCurrent ROI: 10.97x or 997%\nLong-term outlook: Good to Great (3.5/5)\n```\n\n\n---\n\n## RareBunniClub\n\n![RareBunni is a recently launched, yet-to-be revealed \"cute bunny\" PFP project with strong community support from some very well-known NFT clubs.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qlNZYCinZADUYUMp8JROUDMwK3dGWHboRqoJpAEC37FuZtgT1syJuVXk-iwHV5lssaLh7bY7f6wveIGeAckJMk0KWtTrUZJNuIGVXA=s0)\n\nBefore we dive into [RareBunniClub](www.opensea.io/collection/rarebunniclub), we should first talk about what a DAO is. Many of you might have seen the term “DAO” before, but you’ve probably seen that term very recently. A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization, or essentially a club whose finances and operations exist on the blockchain, instead of via bank accounts.\n\nMany NFT projects are operating as DAOs, meaning you gain access to the organization by owning one of their NFTs, and one of the most popular NFT DAOs is CyberKongzBets (CKB), a play on the subreddit “WallStreetBets” famous for pumping the Gamestop and AMC stocks during an epic short squeeze earlier in 2021. CKB is a private Discord server for the owners of [CyberKongz](www.opensea.io/collection/cyberkongz) (see below), a pixelated ape PFP NFT. CKB is well-known in the NFT community for being home to many well-known traders and NFT flippers, and is closely watched by the broader NFT community to see what projects they are purchasing.\n\n![CyberKongz is well-known in the NFT community for having members with deep pockets and an affinity for finding quality PFP projects and \"sweeping the floors\" of upcoming projects in an attempt to make these projects more popular.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WjG6CxWcDQ2nOp0pc27M2.png?height=680&width=680)\n\nEarlier this month we saw the “Kongz,” as they are referred to, sweeping the floor of a few projects, notably [Bitbones](www.opensea.io/collection/thefearface-bitbones) (see my profile picture for an example of a Bitbones). NFT wallet watchers keep track of Kongz’s activities and often try to chase those purchases to get in on the pump. While Kongz is not the only NFT DAO to do so, it is certainly one of the better-known projects.\n\nThis brings us to **RareBunniClub**, the most recent project that Kongz is suspected of coordinating large floor sweeps. Because RareBunni’s are not revealed yet, it is somewhat risky to purchase one pre-reveal, but if the Kongz have it their way this project could see a big pump post-reveal. Just be sure to take profits if you hold more than one, as we don’t know how the art will turn out!\n\n```\nRareBunniClub mint: 0.04 ETH\nPre-reveal floor: 0.09 ETH\nReveal date: Monday, 25 October (late evening, time TBA)\nPost-reveal long-term outlook: Decent to Good (2.5/5)\n```\n\n```\nCyberKongz mint: 0.01 ETH\nCurrent floor: 9.8 ETH\nLong-term outlook: Great to Outstanding (4.5/5)\n```\n\n\n---\n\n## HeadDAO\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6J5nB5XWbtZRTHcf9JdBP.png?height=320&width=320)\n\nSpeaking of NFT DAOs, another big project that launched this past week was [HeadDAO](www.opensea.io/collection/HeadDAO), a new NFT project launched by 16 year old [Shamdoo.eth](https://www.twitter.com/TheShamdoo). Shamdoo is clearly a knowledgeable crypto-native even for his age, and has deftly created a sold-out project that quickly raised over 125 ETH to their treasury (coming from commissions of sales) with the purpose of using the community treasury to purchase valuable blue-chip NFT projects for community ownership.\n\nSuch a concept is not new, but for a 16 year old to lead thousands of internet strangers towards the goal of community ownership of quality digital art is pretty impressive. However, there’s a few things to discuss (this is where the scientist in me comes out) regarding some pitfalls of DAO ownership:\n\n* DAOs are *hard* to truly decentralized. If there’s a community treasury fund in control of a single individual (or small group of individuals) this is not a truly decentralized organization.\n* Decentralizing a DAO’s treasury requires some advanced cryptographic and programming knowledge, and DAO operations and politics can quickly scale to a high level of complexity. It’s important for DAOs to clearly define their goals, roles, and operations to avoid drama.\n* If somebody joins the DAO and later leaves, do they still retain partial ownership of the NFTs their royalties purchased? Most of the time the answer is no, and while I’m not advocating for reform, it’s important for people to realize that DAO membership doesn’t necessarily guarantee proportional ownership of the DAO’s assets.\n\nNow, for those that don’t know me I’m a grad student researcher at an academic institution for decentralization and blockchain research, therefore I often have some highly skeptical takes on certain concepts, and DAOs are my bread and butter. I’ve been studying them for almost 4 years and they’re still a very nascent technology. However, as the cryptosphere and metaverse continue to grow, DAOs will only become more popular over time.\n\n**Back to the project at hand,** HeadDAO minted for a cheap price of 0.055 ETH and is already at a floor of 0.58, providing a healthy 10x return for investors. Due to the DAO mechanics, the well-known persona of Shamdoo in the NFT space, and the desire for community in the metaverse, I anticipate HeadDAO to continue to grow in the short/medium term.\n\nTheir current shared assets include the following blue-chip NFTs:\n\n![CoolCat #5538 was acquired for 9.4 ETH](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E7ZbjUCiIz_J78ZCJMg9a.png?height=600&width=600)\n\n![These 3 CrypToadz were acquired for a total of 20.76 ETH](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RGTIPTYU640I3EBveFoGU.png?height=462&width=833)\n\n![This Genesis CyberKong (remember them?) was acquired for over 97 ETH!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NFvKBtJyfoqYEaVPajJb3.png?height=600&width=600)\n\nThis project is obviously going places, and with a floor of 0.58 this isn’t a bad opportunity to join the club and reap some of the profits!\n\n```\nHeadDAO mint price: 0.055 ETH\nCurrent floor: 0.58 ETH\nCurrent ROI: ~10x, or 900%\nLong-term outlook: Good to Great (3.5/5)\n```\n\n\n---\n\nI’m going to leave you here as I’m about to run to see a film this evening, so unfortunately I don’t have time to cover all of the amazing honorable mentions of the past week.

{"id": "ywZk7sA6rtjeY94jxETe7QdlEHlePJo7fAHcNlbjxuc", "title": "NFT Summary Sunday #2 - 24 October 2021", "body": "# NFT Summary Sunday #2 - 24 October\n\nWelcome back to the second edition of Summary Sunday, where we cover the major events that happened in the NFT metaverse since the last edition. This past week has had several major drops and a few little scandals, and for a few days we saw a lot of despair that NFTs were about to enter a bear market before Bitcoin claimed and then lost a new all-time high, leading to rallies across the board.\n\nLet's dive into some of the major events of the past week.\n\n\n---\n\n## Doodles\n\n![The launch went smoothly and the floor price is way up, but allegations of insider dealing have left a bad taste in the mouths of those who were unable to snag a Doodle on mint day.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VEK5NJanJmeEpyTFdMXPt.png?height=1800&width=1800)\n\nThe digital artist known as Burnt Toast dropped his much-anticipated \"Doodles\" 10k collection, minting for 0.123 ETH per item. As of the time of this writing, the floor is 1.35 ETH, meaning minters were able to claim at least a 10x return on investment within a single week! However, this mint was not without its controversies as the whitelist did not seem to be apportioned entirely equitably. Many notable Crypto Twitter influencers found themselves on the whitelists without having to jump through the same hoops that average users had to just to be whitelisted.\n\nThat being said, making a 10x ROI within a week while reaching 12.1k ETH volume is an indicator of a very strong launch and potentially a decent floor long-term. The question is, once the hype dies down will demand hold the floor steady, or will people take aggressive profits in chasing the next big mint? If it's the former, then that could be an indicator that NFT appreciation is still in full-swing, whereas if the floor drops out and the hype moves on, this could instead indicate frothiness in the market meaning that speculation is in full swing - indicating that the NFT market is in the later stages of a bubble.\n\nOf course, the success of one project doesn't make or break an entire market, but if we see massive floor pumps followed by equally massive dumps, that's a strong indication of pump-and-dump mentality of buyers, meaning a lack of long-term confidence may be preventing quality projects from sustaining their price floors.\n\nI'll be keeping my eye on Doodle, particularly because I love the pastel colors and art, and will be attempting to buy one around the 1 ETH mark. If it starts to take off again above 1.5 I may FOMO in just because I want one desperately for a backup PFP, but we'll have to see what the market dictates in the near future.\n\n```\nMint price: 0.123\nCurrent floor: 1.35\nCurrent ROI: 10.97x or 997%\nLong-term outlook: Good to Great (3.5/5)\n```\n\n\n---\n\n## RareBunniClub\n\n![RareBunni is a recently launched, yet-to-be revealed \"cute bunny\" PFP project with strong community support from some very well-known NFT clubs.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qlNZYCinZADUYUMp8JROUDMwK3dGWHboRqoJpAEC37FuZtgT1syJuVXk-iwHV5lssaLh7bY7f6wveIGeAckJMk0KWtTrUZJNuIGVXA=s0)\n\nBefore we dive into [RareBunniClub](www.opensea.io/collection/rarebunniclub), we should first talk about what a DAO is. Many of you might have seen the term “DAO” before, but you’ve probably seen that term very recently. A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization, or essentially a club whose finances and operations exist on the blockchain, instead of via bank accounts.\n\nMany NFT projects are operating as DAOs, meaning you gain access to the organization by owning one of their NFTs, and one of the most popular NFT DAOs is CyberKongzBets (CKB), a play on the subreddit “WallStreetBets” famous for pumping the Gamestop and AMC stocks during an epic short squeeze earlier in 2021. CKB is a private Discord server for the owners of [CyberKongz](www.opensea.io/collection/cyberkongz) (see below), a pixelated ape PFP NFT. CKB is well-known in the NFT community for being home to many well-known traders and NFT flippers, and is closely watched by the broader NFT community to see what projects they are purchasing.\n\n![CyberKongz is well-known in the NFT community for having members with deep pockets and an affinity for finding quality PFP projects and \"sweeping the floors\" of upcoming projects in an attempt to make these projects more popular.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WjG6CxWcDQ2nOp0pc27M2.png?height=680&width=680)\n\nEarlier this month we saw the “Kongz,” as they are referred to, sweeping the floor of a few projects, notably [Bitbones](www.opensea.io/collection/thefearface-bitbones) (see my profile picture for an example of a Bitbones). NFT wallet watchers keep track of Kongz’s activities and often try to chase those purchases to get in on the pump. While Kongz is not the only NFT DAO to do so, it is certainly one of the better-known projects.\n\nThis brings us to **RareBunniClub**, the most recent project that Kongz is suspected of coordinating large floor sweeps. Because RareBunni’s are not revealed yet, it is somewhat risky to purchase one pre-reveal, but if the Kongz have it their way this project could see a big pump post-reveal. Just be sure to take profits if you hold more than one, as we don’t know how the art will turn out!\n\n```\nRareBunniClub mint: 0.04 ETH\nPre-reveal floor: 0.09 ETH\nReveal date: Monday, 25 October (late evening, time TBA)\nPost-reveal long-term outlook: Decent to Good (2.5/5)\n```\n\n```\nCyberKongz mint: 0.01 ETH\nCurrent floor: 9.8 ETH\nLong-term outlook: Great to Outstanding (4.5/5)\n```\n\n\n---\n\n## HeadDAO\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6J5nB5XWbtZRTHcf9JdBP.png?height=320&width=320)\n\nSpeaking of NFT DAOs, another big project that launched this past week was [HeadDAO](www.opensea.io/collection/HeadDAO), a new NFT project launched by 16 year old [Shamdoo.eth](https://www.twitter.com/TheShamdoo). Shamdoo is clearly a knowledgeable crypto-native even for his age, and has deftly created a sold-out project that quickly raised over 125 ETH to their treasury (coming from commissions of sales) with the purpose of using the community treasury to purchase valuable blue-chip NFT projects for community ownership.\n\nSuch a concept is not new, but for a 16 year old to lead thousands of internet strangers towards the goal of community ownership of quality digital art is pretty impressive. However, there’s a few things to discuss (this is where the “scientist” in me comes out) regarding some pitfalls of DAO ownership:\n\n* DAOs are *hard* to truly decentralize. If there’s a community treasury fund in control of a single individual (or small group of individuals) this is not a truly decentralized organization.\n* Decentralizing a DAO’s treasury requires some advanced cryptographic and programming knowledge, and DAO operations and politics can quickly scale to a high level of complexity. It’s important for DAOs to clearly define their goals, roles, and operations to avoid drama.\n* If somebody joins the DAO and later leaves, do they still retain partial ownership of the NFTs their royalties purchased? Most of the time the answer is no, and while I’m not advocating for reform, it’s important for people to realize that DAO membership doesn’t necessarily guarantee proportional ownership of the DAO’s assets.\n\nNow, for those that don’t know me I’m a grad student finishing his computer science thesis with a blockchain research group, therefore I often have some highly skeptical takes on certain concepts, and DAOs are my bread and butter. I’ve been studying them for almost 4 years and they’re still a very nascent technology. However, as the cryptosphere and metaverse continue to grow, DAOs will only become more popular over time.\n\n**Back to the project at hand,** HeadDAO minted for a cheap price of 0.055 ETH and is already at a floor of 0.58, providing a healthy 10x return for investors. Due to the DAO mechanics, the well-known persona of Shamdoo in the NFT space, and the desire for community in the metaverse, I anticipate HeadDAO to continue to grow in the short/medium term.\n\nTheir current shared assets include the following blue-chip NFTs:\n\n![CoolCat #5538 was acquired for 9.4 ETH](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E7ZbjUCiIz_J78ZCJMg9a.png?height=600&width=600)\n\n![These 3 CrypToadz were acquired for a total of 20.76 ETH](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RGTIPTYU640I3EBveFoGU.png?height=462&width=833)\n\n![This Genesis CyberKong (remember them?) was acquired for over 97 ETH!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NFvKBtJyfoqYEaVPajJb3.png?height=600&width=600)\n\nThis project is obviously going places, and with a floor of 0.58 this isn’t a bad opportunity to join the club and reap some of the profits!\n\n```\nHeadDAO mint price: 0.055 ETH\nCurrent floor: 0.58 ETH\nCurrent ROI: ~10x, or 900%\nLong-term outlook: Good to Great (3.5/5)\n```\n\n\n---\n\nI’m going to leave you here as I’m about to run to see a film this evening, so unfortunately I don’t have time to cover all of the amazing honorable mentions of the past week.

Here’s how:\n\n1. Encode roles with authority by clearly stating the purpose, domain and accountabilities of a specific role. Clear boundaries allows everyone to lead.\n2. Establish that members can take on as few or as many roles as they feel they are capable of maintaining. \n3. Communicate when and how members can make proposals for new roles & policies in [governance meetings](https://www.holacracy.org/governance-meetings) that follow a set protocol for organizational changes.  \n4. Clearly state when and how members can make requests for new projects in [tactical meetings](https://www.holacracy.org/tactical-meetings) for daily operations. \n5.

(Part I)\n", "body": "**DAOs have ushered in a new way of being for people who have been left disenchanted or simply left out by traditional organizational structures.  An exciting new frontier for folks, particularly for creators and crypto believers, who are looking to work in ways that uphold personal agency, autonomy and decentralization.**\n\nThis groundbreaking model of organization and governance does not come without its challenges.  Of course not all DAOs are the same, but frequently new members point out the lack of efficiency, poor organization and information imbalance. The common thread of most complaints is the initial disorientation due to the absence of boundaries. Luckily for DAOs, this is fixable.\n\nInsert *holacracy*.  Holla-what? [Holacracy](https://www.holacracy.org/) is defined as a new social technology for governing and operating an organization via a set of core rules and roles that are distinctly different from those of traditionally governed LLCs, nonprofits or corporations.  Coined by [Brian J. Robertson](https://www.inc.com/ilan-mochari/brian-robertson-man-behind-holacracy-zappos.html), author of “[Holacracy: The New Management System for a Rapidly Changing World](https://www.amazon.com/Holacracy-Management-System-Rapidly-Changing/dp/B01L985542)”, this method of organizing provides extraordinary evolutionary design power behind the collective mission of a distributed community.\n\nOkay, so the DAO has a roadmap, but does it have a Constitution though? [The Constitution](https://www.holacracy.org/constitution/5) is a key element of holacracy that every DAO should consider.  This is essentially the playbook or the rules of the game for a DAO.  It lays out the redistribution of authority without a management hierarchy. It’s a major factor in shaping the mindset of members before, during and after the DAO onboarding or “[wayfinding](https://creators.mirror.xyz/ggSQQlTSGqJ2_U7HVNjm4f3s98on5EfUyR9rW_z3fw0)” process because there are big picture roles to be filled.\n\nReal empowerment requires boundaries and clear expectations via common law or governance.  If DAOs are serious about decentralization then its founding team must take seriously the formation of an empowerment process. Here’s how:\n\n1. Encode roles with authority by clearly stating the purpose, domain and accountabilities of a specific role. Clear boundaries allows everyone to lead.\n2. Establish that members can take on as few or as many roles as they feel they are capable of maintaining.\n3. Communicate when and how members can make proposals for new roles & policies in [governance meetings](https://www.holacracy.org/governance-meetings) that follow a set protocol for organizational changes.\n4. Clearly state when and how members can make requests for new projects in [tactical meetings](https://www.holacracy.org/tactical-meetings) for daily operations.\n5. Normalize the presence of [tension](https://blog.holacracy.org/holacracy-basics-understanding-tensions-98fc3c032acf) in collaborative environments, and give all members the authority to address tension.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3MTjZ33o1O22OlMMGxa0q.png?height=419&width=696)\n\nWhat happens when a DAO (or any organizing body of people) does not have a Constitution? Without it, instead of using energy to work towards the purpose of the DAO, members will:\n\n* Spend more time trying to figure out the limits on their own.\n* Find or create a leader which causes a single point of potential failure.\n* Engage in ineffective self-organizing which leads to poor long-term participation.\n\nIn simple terms, the Constitution shows its members the evolving nature of a DAO’s structure and their dynamic role within it. It sets the tone for rapid iteration, incessant curiosity and continuous learning.\n\nAs a DAO founder, establishing one is important because it signals a few things for all DAO members:\n\n1. Anything is allowed that works toward the DAO’s purpose unless it is explicitly forbidden in the Constitution.\n2. Members are trusted; the DAO has their back when they step fully into their roles, identify necessary actions and execute decision-making power.\n3. Any initial centralized power of DAO founders is ceded to the will of the Constitution, and no DAO member is above it.\n\nThis moves the needle from delegated authority to truly distributed authority. To carry out your role as a DAO member, you can *make any decision or take any action as long as there is no rule against it in the DAO’s Constitution*. It’s a framework that frees members to collaborate with others on projects, bounties and tasks in a way that fulfills their own personal purpose within the larger purpose of the organization but *without asking for permission*.\n\nTo be clear, DAOs do not have to use the Holacracy Constitution as is.  In the spirit of innovation, it can be fully adopted, partially adopted with amendments or a completely different version of a Constitution can be created to best suit the mission of a particular community.  The point is to get one, and use it.\n\nDAOs do not need to throw the baby out with the bathwater so to speak.  Decentralization is great but we do not have to compromise on structure and alignment.  We can get rid of management hierarchies without plunging ourselves into mayheim.  Holacracy’s Constitution, which is intended to be an open source document, allows us to replace the idea of a “boss” with an emergent order as opposed to anarchy.

Nouns is a relatively simple but powerful idea, that can be credited with running an interesting new experiment in the NFT space.\n\nEvery 24 hours, the Nouns Auction Contract sells one new Noun, the proceeds for this sale are all send to the NounsDAO. The founders, who call themselves \"Nounders\" are: [@cryptoseneca](https://twitter.com/cryptoseneca), [@supergremplin](https://twitter.com/supergremplin), [@punk4156](https://twitter.com/punk4156), [@eboyarts](https://twitter.com/eBoyArts), [@punk4464](https://twitter.com/punk4464), solimander, [@dhof](https://twitter.com/dhof), [@devcarrot](https://twitter.com/carrot_init), [@TimpersHD](https://twitter.com/TimpersHD) & [@lastpunk9999](https://twitter.com/lastpunk9999).\n\nAs all of the proceeds of the sales go to the DAO, the Nounders have decided to compensate themselves by minting every 10th Noun to themselves for the first 5 years of the project. Their Nouns are sent to the [Nounder's multisig](https://opensea.io/nounders.eth) to then be vested and shared amongst themselves.\n\n*Nounder distributions don't interfere with the cadence of 24 hour auctions. Nouns are sent directly to the Nounder's Multisig, and auctions continue on schedule with the next available noun ID.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WPiJ8sRV2vCHM8GJpMoqq.png?height=430&width=1432)\n\nFor a full deep-dive into how Nouns works, make sure to check out their [wiki](https://www.notion.so/Explore-Nouns-a2a9dceeb1d54e10b9cbf3f931c2266f).\n\nNow let's look at some data, as of writing, Noun #65 is being auctioned and the [Nouns DAO treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10) contains **8,536 ETH** equivalent to $30,8M. Of the 65 nouns minted so far, 7 belong to the [Nounders](https://opensea.io/nounders.eth).\n\nDuring the last 5 auctions, the moving average of the purchase prices fluctuated between 120.53 - 148.5 ETH. And the current distribution looks a like this, we're only showing the top 7 (all more than 1 Noun) for convenience:\n\n> **Nouns**   **Winner**                **Notes**\n>\n> * 7      [nounders.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5)\n> * 6      [0xf8D...c9a](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf8d24586f793fab81248f0b23f47e5b6bc0a6c9a)\n> * 3      [0xA8b...e7d](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa8b4367f09e63a5234abd14f5ef6868b1aed0e7d)\n> * 3      [0xAe7...15E](https://etherscan.io/address/0xae7f458667f1b30746354abc3157907d9f6fd15e)          [SharkDAO](https://juicebox.money/#/p/sharkdao), a public DAO where everyone can contribute\n> * 3      [0xd04...067](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd049b3064990869c9f73bd7896271d83325d2067)         [1 Confirmation](https://twitter.com/1confirmation), a crypto investment firm extremely focused on NFTs.\n> * 2      [0x253...db4](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2536c09e5f5691498805884fa37811be3b2bddb4)         [xaix.eth](https://twitter.com/xaix2k), a popular NFT Collector\n> * 2      [0x020...872](https://etherscan.io/address/0x020ca66c30bec2c4fe3861a94e4db4a498a35872)         YFI Whale (cc Nansen) and NFT Collector\n\nAs you can see above, we were only able to identify some of the wallets using their ENS records.\n\nNext we look at Nouns governance, which is a fork of Compound's governance module and therefore inherits all its features:\n\n* Nouns can vote on proposals or delegate their vote to a third party\n* A minimum threshold of 1% of the total NOUN supply is required to submit proposals\n* A proposal needs the simple majority to pass, as a minimum of 10% of total votes is reached (quorum)\n* A two-days waiting time before the proposal is executed\n\nIn addition to this Nounders have a **special veto right** to ensure that no malicious proposals can be passed while the noun supply is low. This veto right will only be used if an obviously harmful governance proposal has been passed, and is intended as a last resort.\n\nNounders will provably revoke this veto right when they deem it safe to do so. This decision will be based on a healthy noun distribution and a community that is engaged in the governance process.\n\n## The attack\n\nNow comes the fun part, the attack. This attack was conceived while taking a deeper-dive into Nouns as a whole, and this post is meant to start the discussion on how to potentially solve attack vectors such as this one.\n\nThe obvious thing a malicious actor would try to attack is the projects treasury which we spoke about previously, draining that could yields an incredibly large bounty for all parties involved. The easiest way one could do this would be by way of the governance process, which would be achieved by acquiring Nouns both on the primary and secondary market.\n\nTo perform the attack with 100% certainty one would need to acquire 50% + 1 Nouns. This would mean that as of writing, if you acquire 33 Nouns (supposed veto is not active anymore) you could potentially drain out the entire treasury. The amount you spend doesn't matter as you will recover the entire amount plus the previous treasury as your profit. At the same time it should be noted that the required upfront capital in order to perform such attack grows linearly as the days pass because more Nouns are needed to reach the absolute majority. Therefore the longer the veto remains, the higher the attacker's required capital.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IcJ5QK-m9B9-QO2Zw_43i.png?height=376&width=607)\n\nAdditionally Noun holders could collude to reach the majority required. This collusion could be motivated in a trustless fashion by automatically paying bribes (funded by the treasury) to the users who delegated their vote once the treasury is dissolved.\n\nBoth the attacks are not feasible today thanks to the veto power that Nounders currently maintain but **there is the possibility that malicious actors are already controlling the majority of the Nouns supply and plan to perform such an attack as soon as the veto power will be removed**. Unfortunately it's hard to protect against sybil attacks on public blockchains.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MdPurqv1Sor84gnKsHYh2.png?height=880&width=1334)\n\nIf we assume, for example, that the MA of the last 5 auctions will be the price for the next 50 Nouns. If a malicious actor starts to collect Nouns today they will need 33 Nouns to control the absolute majority of the voting power, therefore the cost of an attack would 33 x 148.5 ETH = 4,900.5 ETH. Once the absolute majority of the voting power will be collected, the treasury would be worth 13,436.5 ETH, netting 8,536 ETH to the attacker.\n\n[With a simple projection we can see under a free market on the auctions how the EV of an attack increases if the settlement price of the auctions remains stable or even decreases.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lwNEg4bXDHPYdFfaXEq0rmfsE0EC2GWw79MtsOqTR9I/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe solution we think fits best to solving this attack is **Ragequitting.**\n\n[MolochDAO pioneered the onchain governance design space](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MolochVentures/Whitepaper/master/Whitepaper.pdf). A mitigation against bad proposals is the ragequit mechanism, which works as follows: once a proposal passes any member of the DAO who has voted against can exit by redeeming their share of the treasury during the grace period before the proposal execution. **The same could be applied to NounsDAO where everyone against the proposal can redeem their pro-rata share of the treasury.**\n\nSomeone could argue that this is unfair because the price paid per Noun differs vastly among buyers, for example Noun #1 was purchased for 613.37 ETH, while Noun #3 was purchased for 36.69 ETH. We conclude however that this is the most correct approach since each Noun is worth one vote. Buyers who bought a Noun below the average price (131.32 ETH) - currently 23 buyers - can potentially perform an arbitrage redeeming their share, but they can achieve the same goal selling the Noun in the secondary market.\n\nThe ragequitting approach can additionally help stabilize the price, leaving room for a potential premium of the Nouns whereas it will become more and more exclusive to be part of the NounsDAO.\n\nWe must note however that Ragequitting opens up a new form of attack vector wherein an attacker could perpetually open bad proposals until all or most members have ragequit.\n\nWe also explored an upgrade to the Moloch approach where Noun Holders against a certain proposal can redeem their purchase price (net of expenses DAO sustained) but in this case entering the NounsDAO would be a risk-free leverage long bet to ETH, which would worsen both the quality of the DAO outcomes and the price discovery process itself.\n\nIt's important to note that other common solutions used by DAOs such as Reserve Price and a Dynamic Quorum are not effective as there is already a treasury standing and it's **impossible to prove that an ongoing sybil attack is not happening right now**.\n\nAn extra measure we would suggest to implement is a **Timelock Increase**. The current 2 day threshold is considerably low, as it cannot be assumed that all members are always able to engage on-chain in such a short time span. Additionally, for external DAOs like SharkDAO getting their DAO to be able to vote within the Nouns proposal could take prior coordination that would extend beyond 2 days. Therefore we propose to increase the timelock to at least 7 days.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAt Indiealistic we believe that Nouns is a truly unique project, a fully autonomous self-governed organization with a transparent and permissionless perpetual onboarding mechanism for new members. On top of that every vote comes with a randomly generated beautiful 8-bit art, completely stored on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWe see Nouns as an interesting case study in on-chain governance, and it comes with its own challenges as the ever growing treasury represent an huge bounty for malicious actors. However, we truly believe the space is maturing enough to overcome them and we are so excited to see the future!", "timestamp": 1635121356, "digest": "pMP-qW3pmVXQWGfUy2FmPuxZHzO8rd4xC3-cinpL79I", "contributor": "0xE9e6Af6B3b011ab4C84D375f3061Bb3C739B83b0"}

Of the 65 nouns minted so far, 7 belong to the [Nounders](https://opensea.io/nounders.eth).\n\nDuring the last 5 auctions, the moving average of the purchase prices fluctuated between 120.53 - 148.5 ETH. And the current distribution looks a like this, we're only showing the top 7 (all more than 1 Noun) for convenience:\n\n> **Nouns**   **Winner**                **Notes**\n>\n> * 7      [nounders.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5)\n> * 6      [0xf8D...c9a](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf8d24586f793fab81248f0b23f47e5b6bc0a6c9a)\n> * 3      [0xA8b...e7d](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa8b4367f09e63a5234abd14f5ef6868b1aed0e7d)\n> * 3      [0xAe7...15E](https://etherscan.io/address/0xae7f458667f1b30746354abc3157907d9f6fd15e)          [SharkDAO](https://juicebox.money/#/p/sharkdao), a public DAO where everyone can contribute\n> * 3      [0xd04...067](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd049b3064990869c9f73bd7896271d83325d2067)         [1 Confirmation](https://twitter.com/1confirmation), a crypto investment firm extremely focused on NFTs.\n> * 2      [0x253...db4](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2536c09e5f5691498805884fa37811be3b2bddb4)         [xaix.eth](https://twitter.com/xaix2k), a popular NFT Collector\n> * 2      [0x020...872](https://etherscan.io/address/0x020ca66c30bec2c4fe3861a94e4db4a498a35872)         YFI Whale (cc Nansen) and NFT Collector\n\nAs you can see above, we were only able to identify some of the wallets using their ENS records.\n\nNext we look at Nouns governance, which is a fork of Compound's governance module and therefore inherits all its features:\n\n* Nouns can vote on proposals or delegate their vote to a third party\n* A minimum threshold of 1% of the total NOUN supply is required to submit proposals\n* A proposal needs the simple majority to pass, as a minimum of 10% of total votes is reached (quorum)\n* A two-days waiting time before the proposal is executed\n\nIn addition to this Nounders have a **special veto right** to ensure that no malicious proposals can be passed while the noun supply is low. This veto right will only be used if an obviously harmful governance proposal has been passed, and is intended as a last resort.\n\nNounders will provably revoke this veto right when they deem it safe to do so. This decision will be based on a healthy noun distribution and a community that is engaged in the governance process.\n\n## The attack\n\nNow comes the fun part, the attack. This attack was conceived while taking a deeper-dive into Nouns as a whole, and this post is meant to start the discussion on how to potentially solve attack vectors such as this one.\n\nThe obvious thing a malicious actor would try to attack is the projects treasury which we spoke about previously, draining that could yields an incredibly large bounty for all parties involved. The easiest way one could do this would be by way of the governance process, which would be achieved by acquiring Nouns both on the primary and secondary market.\n\nTo perform the attack with 100% certainty one would need to acquire 50% + 1 Nouns. This would mean that as of writing, if you acquire 33 Nouns (supposed veto is not active anymore) you could potentially drain out the entire treasury. The amount you spend doesn't matter as you will recover the entire amount plus the previous treasury as your profit. At the same time it should be noted that the required upfront capital in order to perform such attack grows linearly as the days pass because more Nouns are needed to reach the absolute majority. Therefore the longer the veto remains, the higher the attacker's required capital.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IcJ5QK-m9B9-QO2Zw_43i.png?height=376&width=607)\n\nAdditionally Noun holders could collude to reach the majority required. This collusion could be motivated in a trustless fashion by automatically paying bribes (funded by the treasury) to the users who delegated their vote once the treasury is dissolved.\n\nBoth the attacks are not feasible today thanks to the veto power that Nounders currently maintain but **there is the possibility that malicious actors are already controlling the majority of the Nouns supply and plan to perform such an attack as soon as the veto power will be removed**. Unfortunately it's hard to protect against sybil attacks on public blockchains.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MdPurqv1Sor84gnKsHYh2.png?height=880&width=1334)\n\nIf we assume, for example, that the MA of the last 5 auctions will be the price for the next 50 Nouns. If a malicious actor starts to collect Nouns today they will need 33 Nouns to control the absolute majority of the voting power, therefore the cost of an attack would 33 x 148.5 ETH = 4,900.5 ETH. Once the absolute majority of the voting power will be collected, the treasury would be worth 13,436.5 ETH, netting 8,536 ETH to the attacker.\n\n[With a simple projection we can see under a free market on the auctions how the EV of an attack increases if the settlement price of the auctions remains stable or even decreases.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lwNEg4bXDHPYdFfaXEq0rmfsE0EC2GWw79MtsOqTR9I/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe solution we think fits best to solving this attack is **Ragequitting.**\n\n[MolochDAO pioneered the onchain governance design space](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MolochVentures/Whitepaper/master/Whitepaper.pdf). A mitigation against bad proposals is the ragequit mechanism, which works as follows: once a proposal passes any member of the DAO who has voted against can exit by redeeming their share of the treasury during the grace period before the proposal execution. **The same could be applied to NounsDAO where everyone against the proposal can redeem their pro-rata share of the treasury.**\n\nSomeone could argue that this is unfair because the price paid per Noun differs vastly among buyers, for example Noun #1 was purchased for 613.37 ETH, while Noun #3 was purchased for 36.69 ETH. We conclude however that this is the most correct approach since each Noun is worth one vote. Buyers who bought a Noun below the average price (131.32 ETH) - currently 23 buyers - can potentially perform an arbitrage redeeming their share, but they can achieve the same goal selling the Noun in the secondary market.\n\nThe ragequitting approach can additionally help stabilize the price, leaving room for a potential premium of the Nouns whereas it will become more and more exclusive to be part of the NounsDAO.\n\nWe must note however that Ragequitting opens up a new form of attack vector wherein an attacker could perpetually open bad proposals until all or most members have ragequit.\n\nWe also explored an upgrade to the Moloch approach where Noun Holders against a certain proposal can redeem their purchase price (net of expenses DAO sustained) but in this case entering the NounsDAO would be a risk-free leverage long bet to ETH, which would worsen both the quality of the DAO outcomes and the price discovery process itself.\n\nIt's important to note that other common solutions used by DAOs such as Reserve Price and a Dynamic Quorum are not effective as there is already a treasury standing and it's **impossible to prove that an ongoing sybil attack is not happening right now**.\n\nAn extra measure we would suggest to implement is a **Timelock Increase**. The current 2 day threshold is considerably low, as it cannot be assumed that all members are always able to engage on-chain in such a short time span. Additionally, for external DAOs like SharkDAO getting their DAO to be able to vote within the Nouns proposal could take prior coordination that would extend beyond 2 days. Therefore we propose to increase the timelock to at least 7 days.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAt Indiealistic we believe that Nouns is a truly unique project, a fully autonomous self-governed organization with a transparent and permissionless perpetual onboarding mechanism for new members. On top of that every vote comes with a randomly generated beautiful 8-bit art, completely stored on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWe see Nouns as an interesting case study in on-chain governance, and it comes with its own challenges as the ever growing treasury represent an huge bounty for malicious actors. However, we truly believe the space is maturing enough to overcome them and we are so excited to see the future!", "timestamp": 1635121356, "digest": "pMP-qW3pmVXQWGfUy2FmPuxZHzO8rd4xC3-cinpL79I", "contributor": "0xE9e6Af6B3b011ab4C84D375f3061Bb3C739B83b0"}

{"id": "m92kLQeV-ZaT0lXqeYG6CFgO1QyQhZr1CBMpzC2xvsY", "title": "Our Collective Trauma", "body": "There’s a conversation we, as a society, are completely avoiding and the ramifications of such a silence are shredding the fabrics of our shared experience on this planet.\n\nI’m talking about the **collective trauma of the pandemic and the fact that we all, every single person on this planet, experienced (and are still experiencing) the direct pain of intense trauma.** The pain from this trauma, when left unaddressed and ignored, causes us to lash out in unpredictable and destructive manners.\n\n> Group trauma is passed along in ways that impact the entire group. Group trauma can lead to distorted thinking, which often manifests as internalized oppression, as people try to maintain some sense of misplaced control over the circumstances of their oppression. In addition, trauma from long-stranding oppression can leave the group huddled together in a form of stagnated solidarity. When anyone tries to move beyond the place of suffering that the group has occupied, they are attacked by the group and brought back down (Mitchell 56).\n\nWhen layered a top a large population of people already traumatized from the long term impacts of climate crisis and the kleptocracy-capitalism hybrid many of us are navigating along with massive inequality and economic disruption, **it’s no wonder why massive portions of the population are clinging to disinformation that makes them feel empowered over their own lives.** It’s no wonder that identity politics have now reached full scale destruction.\n\n![Stop the Bans protest in Wilmington, NC 2019.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f_nOlArZpYK3BlHyXJ3pc.jpg?height=2000&width=3000)\n\nAs a society, **we’re succumbing to weaponized algorithms willingly as a means of escape** and as a way to feel a sense of solidarity by supporting conspiracies that restore a feeling of agency through a collective enemy that is responsible for the individual’s pain. Mass conspiracies thrive in such an environment of group trauma by providing a means of mutual belief and connection.\n\nAt a very young age, we are taught in western society to ignore our pain and muscle through. We’re taught that pain is weakness and that to feel and express emotions is not something that strong, independent people do. We’re taught that to survive in this world we must “pull ourselves up by our bootstraps” and suffer through whatever pain or trauma has been thrown at us over the span of our lifetimes. **We are taught to internalize the oppressor’s systems of control and blame ourselves for the inequalities baked into our societal fabrics.**\n\nAt a very young age we are taught to accept the means of oppression baked into our social structures and to never question the means or motives of the oppressor. **We accept the consumption based economy and the patriarchal laws as reality,** something we must accept and can not change or push back upon. We believe the narrative of war and destruction as a necessary reality to protect our existence on this planet.\n\n![Stop the Bans protest in Wilmington, NC 2019.   ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sQmhaxCa_-shlWhW_Zxmy.jpg?height=2000&width=3000)\n\nBut here we stand. Bound together by a collective trauma, unaware of the manifestation of pain from that trauma and trying to navigate a system designed to oppress all of us into the acceptance of consumption and destruction as inevitable.\n\nOur societal programming has brought us to a precipice of destruction and if we do not recognize, explore and **accept our individual pain and our neighbor’s pain as valid and help one another process this global experience**, we will never move past the destruction and step into healing.\n\nWhat if we chose to no longer participate in such oppression or weaponized algorithms? What if we all stop, look around and acknowledge the trauma? What if we all lean into those quiet moments of fear and explore the emotion that is behind the fear itself? What if we take a time out and just feel the impacts of losing 700k countrymen and millions of global citizens? **What if we unplug from the weaponized algorithms, go out into our communities and simply talk to one another?**\n\n> The courage to feel pain is something that most of us are never taught. Instead, we learn to distract ourselves from it, insulate, and deflect. The irony is that pain cannot be avoided. When we attempt to avoid our pain, it hunts us down, becoming increasingly stealthy in its machinations...It disrupts our lives, torments our minds, and destroys our relationships (Mitchell 65).\n\nWhat if we **turn to the wisdom of the indigenous peoples** and incorporate their methods of community and healing into our systems now? What if we made healing the planet AND our communities a top priority rather than continuing to destroy our home in the name of economic growth?\n\n![Stop the Bans protests in Wilmington, NC 2019. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uBL5VsMoE8Fez8whiFbbs.jpg?height=2000&width=3000)\n\nWhat if we embraced our pain and began a journey to healing? Are we even capable of such a thing? Can we turn to the wisdom of ancient tribal communities who lived harmoniously with nature on this planet and employ their approach of balancing the masculine and feminine to restore our ability to survive on this planet and navigate the collective trauma of our present and the coming chaos of our immediate future?\n\nI believe we’re rapidly moving past the question of “can we?” We are now facing the reality that “we must.”\n\n**We must process our collective trauma. We must hold space for our communities to heal. We must embrace sacred wisdom. We must balance the masculine with the feminine so our planet can heal. And survive.**\n\n*Work Cited*\n\nMitchell, Sherri L, and Larry Dossey. *Sacred Instructions : Sacred Instructions : Indigenous Wisdom for Living Spirit-Based Change / Indigenous Wisdom for Living Spirit-Based Change*.
