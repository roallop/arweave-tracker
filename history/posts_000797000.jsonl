{"id": "LV23GWjn03WGLQi_Idg0AE_P52vImsc8K4ktMvxeqsQ", "title": "What problem does SoicalFi solve?---Encrypted communication will become a way of life", "body": "First, Blockchain fuck the Central Bank, use blockchain build decentralized cryptocurrency to restricts the power of the regime to print money. With the rise of the Smart Contract Platform, the blockchain begins to fuck Wall Street, through the financial model of asset non-custodial to Challenge the bottom financial order.\n\n\nWhat's next? Web3.0? The next step of the blockchain is fuck Facebook, which uses blockchain to build a data privatization and financial social platform.\n\n\nMake a prediction, Decentralized social networks are the crown jewel of the blockchain's contribution to transforming human civilization.\n\n\nOk, that's the question, what problem does SocialFi actual solve?\n\n\nLooking at the existing social networks, it can be roughly divided into two categories: relationship-base social networking and content-based social networking.\n\n\nRelational social networking is something like Wechat, and the core business is a communication tool between people. Content social networking is something like Twitter. The core busines is a platform for people to write and read articles.\n\n\nThe pain points for users of current relationship social tools are privacy, account and relationship chains are controlled by the platform.\n\n\nOur current IM tools all have privacy issues. With the big data and AI, the authority has the power to spy all users' chat records, which is terrible.\n\n\nPeer-to-peer encrypted communication has existed for a long time, but it has not been popular when it is applied to IM communication. Everyone does not like encryption, including email. The vast majority of users don't care about privacy, the platform only needs to give some sugar, the users will give their precious data to platform. Because of the social network effect, those who care about privacy also have to accept the fate of being controlled by social platforms to chat records.\n\n\nThe mission of the blockchain is likely to be to turn encrypted communication into a way of life, subtly allowing the vast majority of people to use peer-to-peer encrypted communication to protect the privacy of all Internet users.\n\n\nI can't guess how the specific blockchain will promote this lifestyle. For example, will it be chat to mine, talk to earn, etc. I don’t know yet.\n\n\nThe ownership of the current relationship social tool account and the ownership of the relationship chain belong to the platform. As a result of KYC, it is not possible for you to transfer your account to others. After your WeChat friends are added, this kind of relationship chain cannot be transferred to Dingding. This is a bug.\n\n\nBlockchain can easily solve this bug. The account is realized by a public and private key pair. The relationship chain is protocolized, all on the chain, and the IM communication client reads the relationship chain from the chain, and the relationship chain can be imported into any client.\n\n\nThe pain point for current content social users is the ownership of content.\nThe copyright of the articles you write on Weibo and Zhihu does not necessarily belong to you. At least the platform can delete your articles arbitrarily, limit your current flow, and ask you to rectify sensitive words.\n\n\nIt is still very easy for blockchain social to solve this kind of problems, just make the content into NFT.\n\n\nIn SocialFi, the platform can limit the display of your content NFT, but creators can easily transfer their NFT to other platforms. Now that you write articles on Weibo and want to import them to Twitter, the trouble is going to be big, and you keep copying and pasting. If you write for five years, you will not be tired.\n\n\nHowever, the SocialFi platform uses public and private keys as accounts, and 100% migration can be achieved by directly importing encrypted private keys on the platform. Not only the content NFT is migrated, but the relationship chain is also migrated. This greatly increases the ability of the creator and the platform to play games.\n\n\nThere is a need for monetization among users of relationship social and content social. Nowadays, social monetization is basically to bring goods and advertisements, but the platform has to take away a large part of the commission.\n\n\nHow to make social financialization is the key design idea of SocialFi.\n\n\nThe financialization of content socialization is easy to understand. Opensea gives a good example. As long as the content is NFTized, it can be sold. Based on Opensea's further optimization, learning from e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Taobao, and adding good reviews and bad reviews, it becomes a social e-commerce platform. In the future, artists will go directly to the NFT platform to sell their art.\n\n\nThe social financialization of the relationship chain has not yet seen its shadow. This may be the next hot spot for ICOs.\n\nSummary: What problem does SocialFi want to solve?\n\n1. Turn encrypted communication into a way of life.\n2. Return the social account and relationship chain from the social platform to the user.\n3. Give content social creators real content ownership.\n4. Social financial design.\n\n\n1.

With the rise of the Smart Contract Platform, the blockchain begins to fuck Wall Street, through the financial model of asset non-custodial to Challenge the bottom financial order.\n\n\nWhat's next? Web3.0? The next step of the blockchain is fuck Facebook, which uses blockchain to build a data privatization and financial social platform.\n\n\nMake a prediction, Decentralized social networks are the crown jewel of the blockchain's contribution to transforming human civilization.\n\n\nOk, that's the question, what problem does SocialFi actual solve?\n\n\nLooking at the existing social networks, it can be roughly divided into two categories: relationship-base social networking and content-based social networking.\n\n\nRelational social networking is something like Wechat, and the core business is a communication tool between people. Content social networking is something like Twitter. The core busines is a platform for people to write and read articles.\n\n\nThe pain points for users of current relationship social tools are privacy, account and relationship chains are controlled by the platform.\n\n\nOur current IM tools all have privacy issues. With the big data and AI, the authority has the power to spy all users' chat records, which is terrible.\n\n\nPeer-to-peer encrypted communication has existed for a long time, but it has not been popular when it is applied to IM communication. Everyone does not like encryption, including email. The vast majority of users don't care about privacy, the platform only needs to give some sugar, the users will give their precious data to platform. Because of the social network effect, those who care about privacy also have to accept the fate of being controlled by social platforms to chat records.\n\n\nThe mission of the blockchain is likely to be to turn encrypted communication into a way of life, subtly allowing the vast majority of people to use peer-to-peer encrypted communication to protect the privacy of all Internet users.\n\n\nI can't guess how the specific blockchain will promote this lifestyle. For example, will it be chat to mine, talk to earn, etc. I don’t know yet.\n\n\nThe ownership of the current relationship social tool account and the ownership of the relationship chain belong to the platform. As a result of KYC, it is not possible for you to transfer your account to others. After your WeChat friends are added, this kind of relationship chain cannot be transferred to Dingding. This is a bug.\n\n\nBlockchain can easily solve this bug. The account is realized by a public and private key pair. The relationship chain is protocolized, all on the chain, and the IM communication client reads the relationship chain from the chain, and the relationship chain can be imported into any client.\n\n\nThe pain point for current content social users is the ownership of content.\nThe copyright of the articles you write on Weibo and Zhihu does not necessarily belong to you. At least the platform can delete your articles arbitrarily, limit your current flow, and ask you to rectify sensitive words.\n\n\nIt is still very easy for blockchain social to solve this kind of problems, just make the content into NFT.\n\n\nIn SocialFi, the platform can limit the display of your content NFT, but creators can easily transfer their NFT to other platforms. Now that you write articles on Weibo and want to import them to Twitter, the trouble is going to be big, and you keep copying and pasting. If you write for five years, you will not be tired.\n\n\nHowever, the SocialFi platform uses public and private keys as accounts, and 100% migration can be achieved by directly importing encrypted private keys on the platform. Not only the content NFT is migrated, but the relationship chain is also migrated. This greatly increases the ability of the creator and the platform to play games.\n\n\nThere is a need for monetization among users of relationship social and content social. Nowadays, social monetization is basically to bring goods and advertisements, but the platform has to take away a large part of the commission.\n\n\nHow to make social financialization is the key design idea of SocialFi.\n\n\nThe financialization of content socialization is easy to understand. Opensea gives a good example. As long as the content is NFTized, it can be sold. Based on Opensea's further optimization, learning from e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Taobao, and adding good reviews and bad reviews, it becomes a social e-commerce platform. In the future, artists will go directly to the NFT platform to sell their art.\n\n\nThe social financialization of the relationship chain has not yet seen its shadow. This may be the next hot spot for ICOs.\n\nSummary: What problem does SocialFi want to solve?\n\n1. Turn encrypted communication into a way of life.\n2. Return the social account and relationship chain from the social platform to the user.\n3. Give content social creators real content ownership.\n4. Social financial design.\n\n\n1. Turn encrypted communication into a way of life.\n2. Return the social account and relationship chain from the social platform to the user.\n3. Give content social creators real content ownership.\n4.

It rolled like tsunami. \n\nThailand and Singapore fight off a squeeze of the Baht. By July, Thailand devalues its currency by 20% and asks for IMF aid.\n\nCurrencies in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia are squeezed. Singapore. Indonesia. Hong Kong. South Korea. Companies are closed, billions in market value evaporates in Asia.\n\nThe market declines continue, and the crisis hits real economies.\n\nThere are bailout packages but the price in is austerity and closures. Riots, food shortages, and violence follows the drops in currency and markets. The Japanese Yen has to be supported by the US after Japan's first recession in 23 years.\n\n1998, the crisis spreads to Russia and Latin America.\n\nIt's not just the \"emerging markets\", the New York Fed leads a $3.5B USD bailout of Long Term Capital Management, one of the world's largest hedge funds. The Fed cuts rates several times. Early in the crisis, investors buy so many 30 year US treasuries, the yield drops below 5%, for the first time in 30 years.\n\nThe powers-that-be take from one part of a networks, gives to another.\n\nDespite the devastation in Asia, Russia and Latin America, the country of the future, the \"Internet\" begins a feeding frenzy of deals.\n\nTheGlobe, social networking pioneer, is offered at $9, rockets up 600+% on IPO day.

{"id": "JTXmkkwWe6sAkWXLtJVuITIW9DnFmFXAQVwU2Cez0qk", "title": "What I Wish I Knew Before Talking to Lawyers about DAOs", "body": "*Disclaimer: In no way should this be construed as legal or tax advice. Unless you enjoy being subpoenaed, you should definitely talk to a real lawyer ASAP.* \n\nOver the past few weeks, I’ve spent dozens of hours talking to lawyers and getting actual legal advice, and the only thing they all agree on is this: DAOs are a legal grey zone. There is no playbook for creating a legally compliant DAO, and there probably won’t be for some time yet. Token issuance is itself a murky subject, but when you combine it with decentralized governance an extra dose of murkiness is added. Everyone is just experimenting and waiting to see how regulators react. So take everything mentioned here with a heavy dose of salt. \n\nTwo core concepts to mention going into this are Legal Liability and Tax Protection. The first is obvious - if you are setting up a DAO, neither you nor the actual members of the DAO should be putting themselves in any legal jeopardy. The second is more nuanced - your DAO should pay taxes *somewhere*. If you don’t, your local jurisdiction may come after the DAO itself. If you’re looking to avoid paying taxes altogether, you can stop reading right now. \n\nWith the disclaimer and the basic concepts out of the way, here’s what I wish I knew before talking to lawyers about setting up a DAO:\n\n## Options for Setting Up a DAO Legal Entity\n\nThere are five general options for how to legally structure your DAO: \n\n1. Don’t set up an entity at all. \n2. US based LLC. \n3. Offshore Foundation. \n4. Onshore Foundation. \n5. Some combination of the above.\n\n### Option #1: Don’t Set up an Entity at all. \n\nThis is almost certainly a bad idea. Not having an entity at all for the DAO creates three massive risk factors: \n\n1. **No incorporation = unlimited liability**. entities default to being structured as a general partnership. That means that any Members - literally anyone who has ever voted in a governance proposal - can be held fully liable in the event of a lawsuit. \n2. **No incorporation = crazy tax burdens**. Without a formal entity, the members of the DAO have no tax shield. That means, technically, anyone who is involved in the DAO should pay taxes on a proportionate share of the DAO’s income, whether they actually receive any money themselves or not. \n3. **No incorporation = no interaction with the real world**. Without an entity of some kind, the DAO cannot sign contracts (e.g. SAFTs for investments), pay out 3rd party suppliers off chain, own IP, or hold assets. This may be less or more important depending on what the DAO does, but in most cases it’ll end up biting you at some point. \n\nMany DAOs are currently unincorporated, and maybe that’ll end up being fine? But if and when governments decide to investigate, those DAOs are going to create massive headaches for their leadership teams and their members alike. There are actions you can take to protect individual members (e.g. the DAO is unincorporated, but each core member has their own LLC that interacts with the DAO), but this is a hack and unlikely to be considered an effective liability shield should a lawsuit come. ** \n **\n\n### Option #2: Create a US based LLC/S-Corp\n\nThis is probably the best option for DAOs with a majority of their members in the US. After all, for most teams the US government is the number one regulatory consideration. As the old saying goes, “keep your friends close, but your regulatory considerations closer.” \n\nWithin the US, you have a few options for which state to incorporate in. \n\nWyoming has gotten a lot of press attention for their formal recognition of DAOs. Do not actually incorporate there. According to the lawyers I’ve spoken with, it has the same exact upsides as starting an LLC in another state, but with a number of additional downsides. You’ll have to enter additional paperwork, publicly file a smart contract address (reducing your flexibility in the future), dissolve under certain conditions that don’t apply to an LLC, ensure you’re member managed, etc.\n\nThe better option is to set up a Delaware LLC. Not only is this incredibly cheap (few hundred dollars) and fast (typically a few days), but it provides maximum flexibility. As an LLC, you can easily update your operating agreement as your DAO changes. You can also operate as either an LLC or as a C Corp for tax purposes. Many of the most popular DAOs (e.g. Metacartel) are incorporated as Delaware LLCs.\n\nHowever, the Delaware LLC is not without its drawbacks. First, paid staff of the DAO need to be “Members” of the LLC, creating additional friction for your DAO’s growth. Of course, you don’t *have* to update your LLC each time you add a Member, but legally you’d be required to do so. Second, you’re fully subject to the vague and maddening US regulatory regime. If you’re a US person creating the DAO, you’d likely be subject to it anyway, but once you incorporate in the US there’s no escaping this fact. \n\nThe alternative to Delaware is Nevada, which offers many of the same benefits. Since our project won’t be incorporating in the US, I didn’t dive too deeply into the distinction, but it’s probably worth asking about if you’re US-based. \n\n### Option #3: Create an Onshore Foundation\n\nThe Foundation structure offers a number of benefits over LLCs. You have the obvious optics benefits - a DAO-as-Foundation just makes sense. You also have the benefit of better tax status in some jurisdictions. And perhaps most importantly, an onshore Foundation can be “ownerless”, which will reduce the founding team’s legal liability if things go sideways.\n\n“Onshore” in my usage refers to a jurisdiction that is not tax neutral. That means your Foundation will have it’s own taxes to pay, in addition to any taxes paid by its members.\n\nThe primary countries to look at for Onshore foundations are Switzerland (where they are technically called “Associations”) and Singapore. Both have friendly regulatory structures, and both have relatively low tax rates. If you go the Swiss route, you have the additional benefit of being able to personally negotiate - in advance - your tax rate with the local tax authority. On a legal liability ranking, Onshore Foundations score very highly.\n\nThe downside is on tax protection. If you issue a token, there’s a chance you will have to pay taxes on the liquidity you receive which may be detrimental to the DAO’s early operations. Additionally, the Foundation structure also is more expensive to set up. Quotes I’ve been getting are in the $10k-$30k range, though your mileage may vary. \n\n### Option #4: Create an Offshore Foundation\n\n“Offshore” here refers to the opposite of Onshore, in that you create a Foundation somewhere that is tax neutral. \n\nThe three major options here are Panama, the British Virgin Islands, and the Cayman Islands.\n\nPanama is the cheapest and easiest to set up. They have no VASP (Virtual Asset Service Provider) regime in place. In other words, it’s the wild west. This may *sound* good, but sometimes the devil you know is better than the one you don’t. There’s no way of knowing what their VASP regime will end up looking like, and it could be quite tricky. Not to mention Panama is just inherently kind of shady. The optics kind of scream “I’m trying to avoid taxes!”. \n\nThe British Virgin Islands are second cheapest and second easiest. At the time of this writing, they do not have a VASP regime in place, but they have announced they will have a VASP regime at some point in the near future. From the lawyers I’ve spoken with, the rumors are that it will be relatively stringent. But creating a DAO in a jurisdiction that is just about to create new regulations can create risk that is ideally avoidable. \n\nBased on my initial research, the Caymans appear to be the best option. They do have a VASP regime, but it’s relatively light touch. There are some reporting requirements, and registration with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority is required if you issue a token, but it’s generally quite friendly. The Cayman also relies on established British common law, so if you do face legal trouble, you’ll have some sense of what to expect. \n\nOffshore foundations seem to cost roughly the same as onshore foundations to set up and are likely just as good from a legal liability perspective. They are, of course, worse on optics.\n\n### Option #5: Combinations\n\nSo far, the most common approach I’ve seen is actually to mix and match. Typically this means creating a Foundation that is the official legal wrapper of the “DAO” and a separate, wholly unrelated, “Development Agency” (DA) onshore somewhere. This DA is incorporated as an LLC or local equivalent and is registered as a normal non-crypto entity.\n\nA common path is the Cayman Foundation + a Singapore entity. Singapore is often chosen because of it’s relatively low tax rate (\\~17%), business-friendly regulation, and ease of set up for non-Singaporean residents. \n\nHere’s how it works: the DAO has the treasury. Typically, the treasury is held in a multi-sig wallet that “belongs” to the DAO. The DAO/Foundation should also have a business account with an exchange like FTX to provide a fiat off-ramp should you need to pay lawyers, accountants, etc in meatspace. \n\nThe DA pays the leadership team and all associated expenses for the DAO. The Foundation has a Service agreement with the DA and pays accordingly. If, for example, there were $100,000 in expenses, the Foundation may send $120,000 to the DA. The DA then pays taxes on the $20k of profit, ensuring that you are paying taxes *somewhere* as mentioned at the beginning of this essay. In this fashion, the dual structure seems to provide the ideal balance of Legal Liability and Tax Protection. \n\nHave I mentioned that I’m not a lawyer? Now is probably a good time to repeat that fact. \n\n### Getting into the Weeds of the Combo Approach\n\nBefore I get into the weeds, I need to first explain the Roles in a Cayman Foundation. \n\nEvery Foundation must have at least one Director, Supervisor, and Secretary. These can be human beings or corporate entities, and the same entity can be both Director and Secretary if desired. \n\nThe Director literally manages the Foundation. They have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the Foundation’s mission. The Supervisor, well, supervises the Director(s) and ensures they fulfill their duties. The Secretary is an administrative role, and is almost always handled by a local third party. \n\nSo here’s the weeds-y question: what roles will your founding team give itself? One option is to make your team the Directors of the Foundation. This means you will have full control of the Foundation and its spending. You can, of course, write language into the Constitution of the Foundation that the Directors will follow the desires of the community, such that there is still a measure of decentralized governance. However, it is not possible - that I’m aware of - to literally tie the on-chain governance outcomes to the actions of the Foundation beyond this. In theory, this means the Directors could go rogue and go against the wishes of the community. On the bright side, this also means that the Directors serve as an emergency backstop in case your DAO’s governance is attacked by bad actors. \n\nThe upside of making your founding team the Directors is obvious: you will retain control over the DAO in the face of bad actors. \n\nThere are two downsides. First, there’s a potential issue on the tax protection. If a majority of your Directors are from the same jurisdiction, tax authorities there may claim that your offshore foundation isn’t so offshore. In other words, if 3 of your 5 directors are in India, the Indian government may decide to tax your foundation as an Indian foundation. This can be easily remedied by padding your board of directors with local Cayman 3rd parties until no single nationality has a majority. Second, there’s a highly unlikely, but possible, legal liability issue. If you personally are a Director of the Foundation, it may be harder to argue for personal liability protection in worst-case scenarios. This risk is particularly acute if the same people are Directors and owners of the onshore DA. For example, if the US gov wants to claim that you are personally profiting from the DAO in unseemly ways, it may be difficult to argue back. In other words, appointing yourself as a Director creates an individual tie to the DAO.\n\nThe alternative is to make the Directors a group of 3rd party people and set your DA (which your founding team owns/operates) as the Supervisor. \n\nThe upside though is you create an additional layer of legal liability protection between your founding team and the DAO itself.

{"id": "evA-ANnRG0cg6nEQJUOGDnE3lik7ibCSVkc0wsBmppQ", "title": "What I Wish I Knew Before Talking to Lawyers about DAOs", "body": "*Disclaimer: In no way should this be construed as legal or tax advice. Unless you enjoy being subpoenaed, you should definitely talk to a real lawyer ASAP.*\n\nOver the past few weeks, I’ve spent dozens of hours talking to lawyers and getting actual legal advice, and the only thing they all agree on is this: DAOs are a legal grey zone. There is no playbook for creating a legally compliant DAO, and there probably won’t be for some time yet. Token issuance is itself a murky subject, but when you combine it with decentralized governance an extra dose of murkiness is added. Everyone is just experimenting and waiting to see how regulators react. So take everything mentioned here with a heavy dose of salt.\n\nTwo core concepts to mention going into this are Legal Liability and Tax Protection. The first is obvious - if you are setting up a DAO, neither you nor the actual members of the DAO should be putting themselves in any legal jeopardy. The second is more nuanced - your DAO should pay taxes *somewhere*. If you don’t, your local jurisdiction may come after the DAO itself. If you’re looking to avoid paying taxes altogether, you can stop reading right now.\n\nWith the disclaimer and the basic concepts out of the way, here’s what I wish I knew before talking to lawyers about setting up a DAO:\n\n## Options for Setting Up a DAO Legal Entity\n\nThere are five general options for how to legally structure your DAO:\n\n1. Don’t set up an entity at all.\n2. US based LLC.\n3. Offshore Foundation.\n4. Onshore Foundation.\n5. Some combination of the above.\n\n### Option #1: Don’t Set up an Entity at all.\n\nThis is almost certainly a bad idea. Not having an entity at all for the DAO creates three massive risk factors:\n\n1. **No incorporation = unlimited liability**. entities default to being structured as a general partnership. That means that any Members - literally anyone who has ever voted in a governance proposal - can be held fully liable in the event of a lawsuit.\n2. **No incorporation = crazy tax burdens**. Without a formal entity, the members of the DAO have no tax shield. That means, technically, anyone who is involved in the DAO should pay taxes on a proportionate share of the DAO’s income, whether they actually receive any money themselves or not.\n3. **No incorporation = no interaction with the real world**. Without an entity of some kind, the DAO cannot sign contracts (e.g. SAFTs for investments), pay out 3rd party suppliers off chain, own IP, or hold assets. This may be less or more important depending on what the DAO does, but in most cases it’ll end up biting you at some point.\n\nMany DAOs are currently unincorporated, and maybe that’ll end up being fine? But if and when governments decide to investigate, those DAOs are going to create massive headaches for their leadership teams and their members alike. There are actions you can take to protect individual members (e.g. the DAO is unincorporated, but each core member has their own LLC that interacts with the DAO), but this is a hack and unlikely to be considered an effective liability shield should a lawsuit come. \n\n### Option #2: Create a US based LLC/S-Corp\n\nThis is probably the best option for DAOs with a majority of their members in the US. After all, for most teams the US government is the number one regulatory consideration. As the old saying goes, “keep your friends close, but your regulatory considerations closer.”\n\nWithin the US, you have a few options for which state to incorporate in.\n\nWyoming has gotten a lot of press attention for their formal recognition of DAOs. Do not actually incorporate there. According to the lawyers I’ve spoken with, it has the same exact upsides as starting an LLC in another state, but with a number of additional downsides. You’ll have to enter additional paperwork, publicly file a smart contract address (reducing your flexibility in the future), dissolve under certain conditions that don’t apply to an LLC, ensure you’re member managed, etc.\n\nThe better option is to set up a Delaware LLC. Not only is this incredibly cheap (few hundred dollars) and fast (typically a few days), but it provides maximum flexibility. As an LLC, you can easily update your operating agreement as your DAO changes. You can also operate as either an LLC or as a C Corp for tax purposes. Many of the most popular DAOs (e.g. Metacartel) are incorporated as Delaware LLCs.\n\nHowever, the Delaware LLC is not without its drawbacks. First, paid staff of the DAO need to be “Members” of the LLC, creating additional friction for your DAO’s growth. Of course, you don’t *have* to update your LLC each time you add a Member, but legally you’d be required to do so. Second, you’re fully subject to the vague and maddening US regulatory regime. If you’re a US person creating the DAO, you’d likely be subject to it anyway, but once you incorporate in the US there’s no escaping this fact.\n\nThe alternative to Delaware is Nevada, which offers many of the same benefits. Since our project won’t be incorporating in the US, I didn’t dive too deeply into the distinction, but it’s probably worth asking about if you’re US-based.\n\n### Option #3: Create an Onshore Foundation\n\nThe Foundation structure offers a number of benefits over LLCs. You have the obvious optics benefits - a DAO-as-Foundation just makes sense. You also have the benefit of better tax status in some jurisdictions. And perhaps most importantly, an onshore Foundation can be “ownerless”, which will reduce the founding team’s legal liability if things go sideways.\n\n“Onshore” in my usage refers to a jurisdiction that is not tax neutral. That means your Foundation will have it’s own taxes to pay, in addition to any taxes paid by its members.\n\nThe primary countries to look at for Onshore foundations are Switzerland (where they are technically called “Associations”) and Singapore. Both have friendly regulatory structures, and both have relatively low tax rates. If you go the Swiss route, you have the additional benefit of being able to personally negotiate - in advance - your tax rate with the local tax authority. On a legal liability ranking, Onshore Foundations score very highly.\n\nThe downside is on tax protection. If you issue a token, there’s a chance you will have to pay taxes on the liquidity you receive which may be detrimental to the DAO’s early operations. Additionally, the Foundation structure also is more expensive to set up. Quotes I’ve been getting are in the $10k-$30k range, though your mileage may vary.\n\n### Option #4: Create an Offshore Foundation\n\n“Offshore” here refers to the opposite of Onshore, in that you create a Foundation somewhere that is tax neutral.\n\nThe three major options here are Panama, the British Virgin Islands, and the Cayman Islands.\n\nPanama is the cheapest and easiest to set up. They have no VASP (Virtual Asset Service Provider) regime in place. In other words, it’s the wild west. This may *sound* good, but sometimes the devil you know is better than the one you don’t. There’s no way of knowing what their VASP regime will end up looking like, and it could be quite tricky. Not to mention Panama is just inherently kind of shady. The optics kind of scream “I’m trying to avoid taxes!”.\n\nThe British Virgin Islands are second cheapest and second easiest. At the time of this writing, they do not have a VASP regime in place, but they have announced they will have a VASP regime at some point in the near future. From the lawyers I’ve spoken with, the rumors are that it will be relatively stringent. But creating a DAO in a jurisdiction that is just about to create new regulations can create risk that is ideally avoidable.\n\nBased on my initial research, the Caymans appear to be the best option. They do have a VASP regime, but it’s relatively light touch. There are some reporting requirements, and registration with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority is required if you issue a token, but it’s generally quite friendly. The Cayman also relies on established British common law, so if you do face legal trouble, you’ll have some sense of what to expect.\n\nOffshore foundations seem to cost roughly the same as onshore foundations to set up and are likely just as good from a legal liability perspective. They are, of course, worse on optics.\n\n### Option #5: Combinations\n\nSo far, the most common approach I’ve seen is actually to mix and match. Typically this means creating a Foundation that is the official legal wrapper of the “DAO” and a separate, wholly unrelated, “Development Agency” (DA) onshore somewhere. This DA is incorporated as an LLC or local equivalent and is registered as a normal non-crypto entity.\n\nA common path is the Cayman Foundation + a Singapore entity. Singapore is often chosen because of it’s relatively low tax rate (\\~17%), business-friendly regulation, and ease of set up for non-Singaporean residents.\n\nHere’s how it works: the DAO has the treasury. Typically, the treasury is held in a multi-sig wallet that “belongs” to the DAO. The DAO/Foundation should also have a business account with an exchange like FTX to provide a fiat off-ramp should you need to pay lawyers, accountants, etc in meatspace.\n\nThe DA pays the leadership team and all associated expenses for the DAO. The Foundation has a Service agreement with the DA and pays accordingly. If, for example, there were $100,000 in expenses, the Foundation may send $120,000 to the DA. The DA then pays taxes on the $20k of profit, ensuring that you are paying taxes *somewhere* as mentioned at the beginning of this essay. In this fashion, the dual structure seems to provide the ideal balance of Legal Liability and Tax Protection.\n\nHave I mentioned that I’m not a lawyer? Now is probably a good time to repeat that fact.\n\n### Getting into the Weeds of the Combo Approach\n\nBefore I get into the weeds, I need to first explain the Roles in a Cayman Foundation.\n\nEvery Foundation must have at least one Director, Supervisor, and Secretary. These can be human beings or corporate entities, and the same entity can be both Director and Secretary if desired.\n\nThe Director literally manages the Foundation. They have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the Foundation’s mission. The Supervisor, well, supervises the Director(s) and ensures they fulfill their duties. The Secretary is an administrative role, and is almost always handled by a local third party.\n\nSo here’s the weeds-y question: what roles will your founding team give itself? One option is to make your team the Directors of the Foundation. This means you will have full control of the Foundation and its spending. You can, of course, write language into the Constitution of the Foundation that the Directors will follow the desires of the community, such that there is still a measure of decentralized governance. However, it is not possible - that I’m aware of - to literally tie the on-chain governance outcomes to the actions of the Foundation beyond this. In theory, this means the Directors could go rogue and go against the wishes of the community. On the bright side, this also means that the Directors serve as an emergency backstop in case your DAO’s governance is attacked by bad actors.\n\nThe upside of making your founding team the Directors is obvious: you will retain control over the DAO in the face of bad actors.\n\nThere are two downsides. First, there’s a potential issue on the tax protection. If a majority of your Directors are from the same jurisdiction, tax authorities there may claim that your offshore foundation isn’t so offshore. In other words, if 3 of your 5 directors are in India, the Indian government may decide to tax your foundation as an Indian foundation. This can be easily remedied by padding your board of directors with local Cayman 3rd parties until no single nationality has a majority. Second, there’s a highly unlikely, but possible, legal liability issue. If you personally are a Director of the Foundation, it may be harder to argue for personal liability protection in worst-case scenarios. This risk is particularly acute if the same people are Directors and owners of the onshore DA. For example, if the US gov wants to claim that you are personally profiting from the DAO in unseemly ways, it may be difficult to argue back. In other words, appointing yourself as a Director creates an individual tie to the DAO.\n\nThe alternative is to make the Directors a group of 3rd party people and set your DA (which your founding team owns/operates) as the Supervisor.\n\nThe upside though is you create an additional layer of legal liability protection between your founding team and the DAO itself. This may be more important if you are a US citizen or if you otherwise want to keep your personal involvement in the DAO private for whatever reason.\n\nThis has the disadvantage of giving power (potentially) to a group of strangers. In practice, these 3rd parties are typically lawyers in the Caymans, so the risk is low, but it does exist. It is also more expensive to go this DA-as-Supervisor route, since you’ll need to pay the 3rd party Directors every year for their services.\n\n### Token Issuance\n\nThere’s another 381 pages waiting to be written about how to issue a token, but fortunately there are a number of resources online that put it better than I ever could.

Jamila Woods)' (Official)\n\n[https://youtu.be/PctUKuCVCD8](https://youtu.be/PctUKuCVCD8)\n\n### Biography\n\nSimon Green, AKA Bonobo, is an artist very much at the peak of his powers. His 2013 album ‘The North Borders’ was the high watermark of his career to date: a masterful record, marrying Green's inimitable melodic genius to cutting edge electronics, bass and drums.\n\nAn artist that constantly pushes himself outside of his musical comfort zone, Bonobo’s ranging personal tastes and regularly expanding range of synthesizers and instruments continue to take his productions to new levels. This outlook has earned him a reputation as one of the most pioneering figures in electronic music, in both his solo DJ sets and 12-piece live band shows.\n\nAll this comes as the result of over ten years hard work, and five albums that have honed Green's skills. A born musician, Green - like many artists - expresses himself most articulately via his music. The result is that his work is always keenly felt, and always feels imperative. There are no wasted moments, and myriad great ones.\n\nIt's tempting to relate Green's yearning, emotive aesthetic to his upbringing in rural Hampshire. His move to Brighton is also an influence; his skill at drum programming perhaps harking back to his days DJing and producing in the small, musically fertile town. Under the initial guidance of Tru Thoughts' Rob Luis and at nights such as Phonic:hoop, Bonobo found an early education in music.\n\nHis first album - 2000's 'Animal Magic' - was released via Tru Thoughts before being picked up by Ninja Tune. It announced him as a serious talent; able to bring a true musician's edge to electronic music, with all the freedom that skill allowed. His subsequent albums for Ninja, Dial M for Monkey and Days to Come, developed his sensibility, won him fans across the globe, and saw him develop his live show into a mesmeric re-working of his records.\n\nHe also worked hard as a DJ, a part of Green's arsenal that perhaps truly came into its own at the same time as 2010’s Black Sands. 2012 saw him take the uptempo, club re-edits of Black Sands from a seminal Boiler Room performance in London to dance floors across the world, and unveil a new light show that further enhanced the impact of these stunning songs. A remix album was released featuring reworkings by fans and peers such as Machinedrum, Floating Points, Mark Pitchard, Lapalux and Falty DL.\n\nLater the same year, he finally settled down in his New York studio to write his fifth album. The North Borders was another long stride forward - both a natural evolution and a continuation of the electronic palette of Black Sands. Thematic, resonant, addictive and perfectly formed, it's a thrillingly coherent statement piece. With vocal features from no less than Erykah Badu, as well as Grey Reverend (Cinematic Orchestra) and Cornelia (Portico Quartet) it's another finely balanced body of work, leaving room for the beautiful, rich productions themselves to breathe and shine.\n\nBonobo has a long history of unearthing new talent (Andreya Triana, Bajka) and The North Borders saw him do so once again. The startling vocals of new collaborator Szjerdene are sprinkled across the album, and Green has yet again found the perfect voice to express where he's at.\n\nSince the album’s release, Green has gone on to play over 175 shows across three continents and 30 countries, wowing audiences of almost 2 million people with the hypnotic, extended live versions of his songs. He performed sold out shows at The Sydney Opera House and Brixton Academy, and his very own, day long festival at London’s Roundhouse. 2014 saw him and his band play the iconic Coachella festival, Sonar, Glastonbury and many more. This period of extensive touring came to a breathtaking close with his largest show to date at London’s Alexandra Palace in November. In celebration, Ninja Tune released ‘The North Borders Tour. - Live’ in October. A deluxe release including a live album, hardback book and a DVD of seminal live performances from a truly memorable tour.\n\nIt’s a full schedule and then some, but one that’s constantly rewarding for his fans, and perhaps proves that Bonobo is not only one of the world’s hardest working artists in electronic music, but also one of its best.", "timestamp": 1635133069, "digest": "liVkZif4ofDKWXxTNHw9JG5xk2dgPTP64YglX9JIo6A", "contributor": "0x69b2B3a4Ac5009cebCf39DA9b25C8815Dc97C3bf"}

Jamila Woods)' (Official)\n\n[https://youtu.be/PctUKuCVCD8](https://youtu.be/PctUKuCVCD8)\n\n### Biography\n\nSimon Green, AKA Bonobo, is an artist very much at the peak of his powers. His 2013 album ‘The North Borders’ was the high watermark of his career to date: a masterful record, marrying Green's inimitable melodic genius to cutting edge electronics, bass and drums.\n\nAn artist that constantly pushes himself outside of his musical comfort zone, Bonobo’s ranging personal tastes and regularly expanding range of synthesizers and instruments continue to take his productions to new levels. This outlook has earned him a reputation as one of the most pioneering figures in electronic music, in both his solo DJ sets and 12-piece live band shows.\n\nAll this comes as the result of over ten years hard work, and five albums that have honed Green's skills. A born musician, Green - like many artists - expresses himself most articulately via his music. The result is that his work is always keenly felt, and always feels imperative. There are no wasted moments, and myriad great ones.\n\nIt's tempting to relate Green's yearning, emotive aesthetic to his upbringing in rural Hampshire. His move to Brighton is also an influence; his skill at drum programming perhaps harking back to his days DJing and producing in the small, musically fertile town. Under the initial guidance of Tru Thoughts' Rob Luis and at nights such as Phonic:hoop, Bonobo found an early education in music.\n\nHis first album - 2000's 'Animal Magic' - was released via Tru Thoughts before being picked up by Ninja Tune. It announced him as a serious talent; able to bring a true musician's edge to electronic music, with all the freedom that skill allowed. His subsequent albums for Ninja, Dial M for Monkey and Days to Come, developed his sensibility, won him fans across the globe, and saw him develop his live show into a mesmeric re-working of his records.\n\nHe also worked hard as a DJ, a part of Green's arsenal that perhaps truly came into its own at the same time as 2010’s Black Sands. 2012 saw him take the uptempo, club re-edits of Black Sands from a seminal Boiler Room performance in London to dance floors across the world, and unveil a new light show that further enhanced the impact of these stunning songs. A remix album was released featuring reworkings by fans and peers such as Machinedrum, Floating Points, Mark Pitchard, Lapalux and Falty DL.\n\nLater the same year, he finally settled down in his New York studio to write his fifth album. The North Borders was another long stride forward - both a natural evolution and a continuation of the electronic palette of Black Sands. Thematic, resonant, addictive and perfectly formed, it's a thrillingly coherent statement piece. With vocal features from no less than Erykah Badu, as well as Grey Reverend (Cinematic Orchestra) and Cornelia (Portico Quartet) it's another finely balanced body of work, leaving room for the beautiful, rich productions themselves to breathe and shine.\n\nBonobo has a long history of unearthing new talent (Andreya Triana, Bajka) and The North Borders saw him do so once again. The startling vocals of new collaborator Szjerdene are sprinkled across the album, and Green has yet again found the perfect voice to express where he's at.\n\nSince the album’s release, Green has gone on to play over 175 shows across three continents and 30 countries, wowing audiences of almost 2 million people with the hypnotic, extended live versions of his songs. He performed sold out shows at The Sydney Opera House and Brixton Academy, and his very own, day long festival at London’s Roundhouse. 2014 saw him and his band play the iconic Coachella festival, Sonar, Glastonbury and many more. This period of extensive touring came to a breathtaking close with his largest show to date at London’s Alexandra Palace in November. In celebration, Ninja Tune released ‘The North Borders Tour. - Live’ in October. A deluxe release including a live album, hardback book and a DVD of seminal live performances from a truly memorable tour.\n\nIt’s a full schedule and then some, but one that’s constantly rewarding for his fans, and perhaps proves that Bonobo is not only one of the world’s hardest working artists in electronic music, but also one of its best.", "timestamp": 1635133069, "digest": "liVkZif4ofDKWXxTNHw9JG5xk2dgPTP64YglX9JIo6A", "contributor": "0x69b2B3a4Ac5009cebCf39DA9b25C8815Dc97C3bf"}

{"id": "ymbNmEgq8riq2NN4AwrEYHOl0i-joVXpxbnkB01IarY", "title": "NFTs Explained, with a token project", "body": "Currencies are the most obvious category of tokens created on  Blockchain networks. The requirement to keep the nodes virtuous demands them to be fungible. Two Bitcoins minted on different days will ideally have no difference in value on a given date, like a couple of dollar bills. Any alteration in data provided to generate these coins will not create a variant. The equivalency or non-uniqueness trait of currencies restricts the utility to the representation of account balances. However, the Blockchain, as a truth machine, can be used for purposes not confined to payments, and one such notable application is to use as a ledger for defining ownership of assets. The title records or deeds exist on the Blockchain as toke type called NFTs.\n\n\nAn NFT is a token living on a blockchain, which is intrinsically unique. The token has a field token id, which is of type, unsigned integer. The token id can range from 0 and go till 2^256-1. Two NFTs of the same kind would be different, unexchangeable, and depending on what metadata they hold, they may have different perceptive values. NFTs can convey possession of off-chain or on-chain assets. For instance, the City of Miami could opt to use a chain (say Ethereum) to register property settlements. The land department will be required to make individual tokens for every single property. An NFT can (and should) hold pertinent information. In this case, the address or the geolocation coordinate can be used as information to generate ownership tokens. Real-Estate is a perfect example of off-chain assets as NFTs. With regards to the on-chain case, typical NFTs hold SVGs images and surrounding metadata inside the tokens.\n\n\nEthereum was the first chain to enable the hosting of NFTs. EIP-721 introduced the concept as a proposal of having tokens on the network to represent ownerships. The EIP (proposal), now an ERC (standard), was created in January 2018 by William Entriken, Dieter Shirley, Jacob Evans, Nastassia Sachs to have deeds on the chain. This standard defines a set of interfaces to support the creation (minting), transfer, balance and store of metadata. All Smart Contracts, which wish to allow minting of these tokens, need to have methods events defined in this ERC. The standard specifies a must implement and two optional interfaces. Developers can add additional methods too to their NFT Contracts if needed. Interfaces in the specification do not imply functions for the creation and burning(destruction) of tokens, and the developer can define them as suited.\n\nThe standard prescribes 4 Interfaces:\n\n `ERC721`, The first one, which also has the standard's name, is a MUST implement for the minting contract.\n`ERC721Metadata` Metadata interface is optional and provides read methods for name, symbol and URI of the Token. The URI holds the metadata of each token, which may comply with a JSON schema. Market places like OpenSean can display NFTs because the contracts store data in this spec.\n`ERC721Enumerable` Enumerable interface allows inquiry on the Contract for ownership and supply limit of the tokens. The intention was to enable the discoverability of this type of Contract.\n`ERC721TokenReceiver` Token receiver interfaces are for wallets to implement. This interface enables senders to perform safety checks before the transfer.\n\nAn Ethereum NFT contract will generate three events:\n\n `Transfer` is generated when a new token is minted or transferred to a new address\n`Approval` is emitted when a new approver address is added by the owner to a token, the approver can transfer the owner token to another account\n`ApprovalForAll` same as approval, but emitted as part of a different method that can change approvers for multiple tokens.\n\nThe main contract has these methods:\n\n`balanceOf` number of tokens owned by address\n`ownerOf` returns owner of tokenId\n`safeTransferFrom` Makes a safe check before doing the transfer to a new address\n`transferFrom` transfers the token to a new address\n`approve` Adds a new address as approver for a token, can be called by token owner only\n`setApprovalForAll` sets approver to multiple tokens\n`getApproved` retrieves approver address if any\n`isApprovedForAll` checks for pending approvers\n\nTo illustrate, I have created an NFT contract, which can mint ERC-721 tokens named **SIJ-tokens**. This DAPP would mint tokens to hold on-chain data, will represent characters with their index as they appear in the spelling of my name, for Eg S0, I1, S6 etc. The supply is limited to seven individual and unique items. \n\n![SIJ-Token - I1](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/X9TJQdsSvG8hN1irxk42f.png?height=150&width=150)\n\nA number ranging from zero to six would be required as input to invoke the minting function. Tokens with characters S or E would be two each in number, and thus the ones with I, J and H are  rarer. I am importing [OpenZepplin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts) Contract samples here to reduce my code. Openzepplin provides contract files conforming to required standards or having reusable solutions. Importing code from this repository is a common practice in Ethereum app development. The changes required to the Contract after performing the imports were minimum. To enable external minting of tokens, a public method named Claim was added. Additionally, the \"TokenURI\" function was overridden to have the required metadata generation. The definition for these two methods is following in the post. Nevertheless, the whole code of the Contract is available on Etherscan. The tokenURI function will return a JSON object, which will have an SVG image to show token data\n\n```\n function claim(uint256 tokenId) public   {\n      require(tokenId > 0 && tokenId < 7, \"Token ID invalid\");\n     \n        _mint(msg.sender, tokenId);\n        //_setTokenURI(tokenId, tokenURI(tokenId));\n    }\n\n\nfunction tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) public view virtual override returns (string memory) {\n       string memory tokenStr =  toString(tokenId);\n        string[19] memory parts;\n        parts[0]= '<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMinYMin meet\" viewBox=\"0 0 200 200\">';\n        parts[1] = '<circle cx=\"100\" cy=\"100\" r=\"75\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"4\" fill=\"red\" />';\n        parts[2] ='<text x=\"60\" y=\"130\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"smaller\">~ SIJ TOKEN ~</text>';\n        parts[3] ='<text x=\"75\" y=\"100\" fill=\"black\" font-weight=\"bold\" font-size=\"3em\">';\n        parts[4]=characters[tokenId];\n        parts[5]=tokenStr;\n        parts[6]='</text>';\n        parts[7] ='</svg>';\n        string memory output = string(abi.encodePacked(parts[0], parts[1], parts[2], parts[3], parts[4], parts[5], parts[6], parts[7]));\n        string memory json = Base64.encode(\n            bytes(\n                string(\n                    abi.encodePacked(\n                        '{\"name\": \"SIJ -',tokenStr, '\", \"description\": \"Awesome Collectibles - SIJ Tokens\", \"image\": \"data:image/svg+xml;base64,', Base64.encode(bytes(output)), '\"}'))));   \n        output = string(abi.encodePacked('data:application/json;base64,', json));\n        return output;\n       \n   }\n```\n\nI have deployed the contract on Testnet Rinkeby, links below\n\nRinkeby Etherscan link - [https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x6b238761c25894cba26d7a7eec54b245516c9617](https://www.notion.so/c25894cba26d7a7eec54b245516c9617)\n\nSample minted NFT - <https://rinkeby.rarible.com/token/0x6b238761c25894cba26d7a7eec54b245516c9617:1?tab=details>", "timestamp": 1635138186, "digest": "HLcbZiJDxPrGY28YJ7UpCtuGREzRT97-XWoxzdL3KnI", "contributor": "0xf880FCd62e27495aA3c9427c4c70A5De66D8d0d2"}

Anchor introduces some utilities for fast iterative integration testing of your program.\n3.  The client, which is at `./client.js`. This is a stand-in for what would be your frontend in an actual dApp.\n\n## Diving into the program\n\nOpen `./program/basic-0/src/lib.rs` and you'll see the following:\n\n    use anchor_lang::prelude::*;\n\n    declare_id!(\"Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS\");\n\n    #[program]\n    mod basic_0 {\n        use super::*;\n        pub fn initialize(_ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> ProgramResult {\n            Ok(())\n        }\n    }\n\n    #[derive(Accounts)]\n    pub struct Initialize {}\n\nLet's step through each piece of this.\n\n    use anchor_lang::prelude::*;\n\nSimilar to Rust itself, anchor has a prelude. This imports all the pieces of the anchor framework that we'll need to define our program.\n\n    declare_id!(\"Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS\");\n\n`declare_id!` declares what the program's account id is, and allows for a consistent program id everywhere we deploy this (locally, devnet, testnet, mainnet-beta). Note that if we actually deploy this, anchor would instead pick a different account id, because we will have to generate a new keypair.\n\n(side-note: This is a piece of anchor I'm still trying to wrap my head around. There's more discussion about a more ergonomic way of doing this [here](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/issues/695)).\n\n    #[program]\n    mod basic_0 {\n        use super::*;\n        pub fn initialize(_ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> ProgramResult {\n            Ok(())\n        }\n    }\n\nA lot going on here. First, we define a [Rust module](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules.html) called basic\\_0. Since this module has the [program attribute](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/blob/master/lang/attribute/program/src/lib.rs), anchor will know that this module contains all the program instruction handlers.\n\nIn your editor, try deleting `use super::*;` and run `anchor build`. This will fail to compile! This is because `use super::*;` brings all the things we imported in from the anchor prelude into the current module's context.\n\nFinally, we get to the initialize handler, which is the only instruction that we've defined as part of this Anchor program. Our initialize handler takes in one parameter, `_ctx` which has type `Context<Initialize>`. This is a really stripped down example, so we won't perform any business logic inside this instruction handler. In a non-trivial instruction handler, this parameter would hold our account data, which we would be able to manipulate. Here, we just return `Ok(())`, which returns a successful result back to the client.\n\n    #[derive(Accounts)]\n    pub struct Initialize {}\n\nFinally, we have the last piece of the program, which describes the Initialize struct. In a non-trivial program, this would define *all* (and I mean *all*) the accounts that are manipulated by the instruction handler. Since we aren't actually using any accounts in this example, we don't need to add anything. However, we still need to define a struct that holds all the accounts and signal to the instruction handler what we should expect from the client.\n\n## Building and Emitting an IDL\n\nAlright, we can now use the anchor CLI to build our program, and emit an IDL. You can think of the IDL as the specification of your program for clients. Let's run `anchor build`, then open `target/idl/basic_0.json`.\n\nYou'll see the following:\n\n    {\n      \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n      \"name\": \"basic\",\n      \"instructions\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"initialize\",\n          \"accounts\": [],\n          \"args\": []\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n\nThe most important thing listed here is the set of instructions. Anchor has used the program definition we created above to generate this IDL. We have one instruction, with name `initialize` (the same as our instruction handler). It has no accounts, as we specified in the `Initialize` struct, and no `args`, which we have because the `initialize` instruction handler only takes in one argument (`_ctx`).\n\nThis file is the key bridge between your anchor program and consuming it in the client and integration tests. It is how anchor's frontend utilities know how to call your program.\n\n## Deploying and Testing with a Client\n\nNow that we've built our program, we can now deploy it locally.\n\n## Deploying locally\n\nIf you haven't used solana before, you should generate a wallet first.\n\n    solana-keygen new\n\nThen run\n\n    solana-test-validator\n\nThis test validator will allow us to test a local deploy of our program. Let's do that now.\n\n    anchor deploy\n\nYou should see the following output:\n\n    Deploying workspace: http://127.0.0.1:8899\n    Upgrade authority: ...\n    Deploying program \"basic-0\"...\n    Program path: ...\n    Program Id: someId.....\n\nCopy the Program Id. That is the address of your program on your local network!\n\n## The client\n\nOpen `./client.js` in your editor. You'll see the following:\n\n    // ... snip\n\n    // Read the generated IDL.\n    const idl = JSON.parse(\n      require(\"fs\").readFileSync(\"./target/idl/basic_0.json\", \"utf8\")\n    );\n\n    // Address of the deployed program.\n    const programId = new anchor.web3.PublicKey(\"<YOUR-PROGRAM-ID>\");\n\n    // Generate the program client from IDL.\n    const program = new anchor.Program(idl, programId);\n\n    // Execute the RPC.\n    await program.rpc.initialize();\n\n    // ... snip\n\nLet's break this down. First we have the IDL we generated before, which we read in from JSON. Then, we define the program's id, which you should have copied above. We define the program using anchor's tooling, which takes in the idl and program id, and defines (at runtime) the interface to the program. Finally, we execute the initialize instruction locally!\n\nNow, let's actually run the client. We'll need to get the path to your wallet's keypair, so run\n\n    solana config get keypair\n\nthen\n\n    ANCHOR_WALLET=<YOUR-KEYPAIR-PATH> node client.js\n\nYou've now created a client and executed a transaction!\n\n**Make sure you shut down the solana-test-validator for this next part!**\n\n## Testing using the integration testing framework\n\nThis workflow we have with the client isn't practical for local development on our programs. It's just not ergonomic, we'll have to copy and paste a bunch of things every time we want to make changes. Even more problematic is that as we develop more complicated applications, it will get more and more difficult to maintain the scaffold of state needed to test complicated scenarios.\n\nAnchor has a solution for this: `anchor test`. Let's take a look at `./tests/basic-0.js`\n\n    const anchor = require(\"@project-serum/anchor\");\n\n    describe(\"basic-0\", () => {\n      // Configure the client to use the local cluster.\n      anchor.setProvider(anchor.Provider.local());\n\n      it(\"Uses the workspace to invoke the initialize instruction\", async () => {\n        // #region code\n        // Read the deployed program from the workspace.\n        const program = anchor.workspace.Basic0;\n\n        // Execute the RPC.\n        await program.rpc.initialize();\n        // #endregion code\n      });\n    });\n\nFirst, we import anchor. Then, we define a test block. We set up anchor to use the local provider.\n\n#### SHARP EDGE ALERT\n\n`anchor.workspace.Basic0` is loaded into the test environment for us. I'm really not sure exactly how the workspace feature works yet, but changing the program can generate a different idl that wouldn't be represented here. Just be careful when making changes to the name of your program module and make sure the tests represent that.\n\nAnyways, this does all the work for us we did in the client previously. So, now we can just do the exact same call we did in the client, `await program.rpc.initialize();`\n\nThe test framework here gives you more flexibility to specify different account ids programmatically, and make sure that you're always starting with fresh state on each test run.\n\nThanks for reading all, it's been fun to learn anchor and rust over the past couple months. The docs were a big inhibitor for me so I'd like to do more of these deep dives to illuminate the way for anchor.\n", "timestamp": 1635139341, "digest": "w3-WcRd8aablvFf8Er5qH4H4b-x-8UVfhElMv6Uwick", "contributor": "0x840B1dC2abb99f1F86D549303719610F346B2aaF"}

Jamila Woods)' (Official)\n\nTaken from the album 'Fragments', released 14 January 2022\n\n[https://youtu.be/PctUKuCVCD8](https://youtu.be/PctUKuCVCD8)\n\n### Biography\n\nSimon Green, AKA Bonobo, is an artist very much at the peak of his powers. His 2013 album ‘The North Borders’ was the high watermark of his career to date: a masterful record, marrying Green's inimitable melodic genius to cutting edge electronics, bass and drums.\n\nAn artist that constantly pushes himself outside of his musical comfort zone, Bonobo’s ranging personal tastes and regularly expanding range of synthesizers and instruments continue to take his productions to new levels. This outlook has earned him a reputation as one of the most pioneering figures in electronic music, in both his solo DJ sets and 12-piece live band shows.\n\nAll this comes as the result of over ten years hard work, and five albums that have honed Green's skills. A born musician, Green - like many artists - expresses himself most articulately via his music. The result is that his work is always keenly felt, and always feels imperative. There are no wasted moments, and myriad great ones.\n\nIt's tempting to relate Green's yearning, emotive aesthetic to his upbringing in rural Hampshire. His move to Brighton is also an influence; his skill at drum programming perhaps harking back to his days DJing and producing in the small, musically fertile town. Under the initial guidance of Tru Thoughts' Rob Luis and at nights such as Phonic:hoop, Bonobo found an early education in music.\n\nHis first album - 2000's 'Animal Magic' - was released via Tru Thoughts before being picked up by Ninja Tune. It announced him as a serious talent; able to bring a true musician's edge to electronic music, with all the freedom that skill allowed. His subsequent albums for Ninja, Dial M for Monkey and Days to Come, developed his sensibility, won him fans across the globe, and saw him develop his live show into a mesmeric re-working of his records.\n\nHe also worked hard as a DJ, a part of Green's arsenal that perhaps truly came into its own at the same time as 2010’s Black Sands. 2012 saw him take the uptempo, club re-edits of Black Sands from a seminal Boiler Room performance in London to dance floors across the world, and unveil a new light show that further enhanced the impact of these stunning songs. A remix album was released featuring reworkings by fans and peers such as Machinedrum, Floating Points, Mark Pitchard, Lapalux and Falty DL.\n\nLater the same year, he finally settled down in his New York studio to write his fifth album. The North Borders was another long stride forward - both a natural evolution and a continuation of the electronic palette of Black Sands. Thematic, resonant, addictive and perfectly formed, it's a thrillingly coherent statement piece. With vocal features from no less than Erykah Badu, as well as Grey Reverend (Cinematic Orchestra) and Cornelia (Portico Quartet) it's another finely balanced body of work, leaving room for the beautiful, rich productions themselves to breathe and shine.\n\nBonobo has a long history of unearthing new talent (Andreya Triana, Bajka) and The North Borders saw him do so once again. The startling vocals of new collaborator Szjerdene are sprinkled across the album, and Green has yet again found the perfect voice to express where he's at.\n\nSince the album’s release, Green has gone on to play over 175 shows across three continents and 30 countries, wowing audiences of almost 2 million people with the hypnotic, extended live versions of his songs. He performed sold out shows at The Sydney Opera House and Brixton Academy, and his very own, day long festival at London’s Roundhouse. 2014 saw him and his band play the iconic Coachella festival, Sonar, Glastonbury and many more. This period of extensive touring came to a breathtaking close with his largest show to date at London’s Alexandra Palace in November. In celebration, Ninja Tune released ‘The North Borders Tour. - Live’ in October. A deluxe release including a live album, hardback book and a DVD of seminal live performances from a truly memorable tour.\n\nIt’s a full schedule and then some, but one that’s constantly rewarding for his fans, and perhaps proves that Bonobo is not only one of the world’s hardest working artists in electronic music, but also one of its best.", "timestamp": 1635141249, "digest": "liVkZif4ofDKWXxTNHw9JG5xk2dgPTP64YglX9JIo6A", "contributor": "0x69b2B3a4Ac5009cebCf39DA9b25C8815Dc97C3bf"}

Yung，Summer Zhao 对本文的校对\n\n## DAO 的前世今生\n\n2016 年 4 月 30 日，区块链公司 [Slock.it](http://Slock.it) 发起了第一个 DAO 项目---The DAO，这是一个早期的去中心化自治组织（DAO）和风险投资基金。当时 11000 人投资了 1150 万个 ETH，占以太坊总供应量 14%，价值约为 1.5 亿美元。这也让 The DAO 成为了当时最大的众筹项目，FOMO 程度超出了很多人的想象，包括项目方自己。\n\n「The DAO 是经济组织理念的一个范式转变。它提供了完全的透明度，完全的股东控制权，前所未有的灵活性和自主治理」。\n\n然而，乐极生悲。「暂停交易，我们遭到了攻击。」2016 年 6 月 17 日，黑客利用 The DAO「递归调用」和「调用转移避免销毁」两个漏洞，进行了两百多次攻击，总共盗走了 360 万的以太坊，超过了该项目筹集的以太坊总数目的三分之一。\n\n然而黑客并无法直接变现，按照当时智能合约条款，这些资金会被搁置 28 天，这给了 The DAO 和以太坊社区近一个月的时间来考虑如何处理。后面，大家都知道了，以太坊社区进行了硬分叉，分成了 ETC 和 ETH，借此挽救这次的损失。以太坊核心团队不能强迫社区转移，但人们用脚投票，回答了这个问题：消除黑客的好处是否超过了人为干预对以太坊信任的代价？对大多数人来说，确实如此。\n\n如果不是因为分叉，黑客在 2016 年 6 月 17 日从 The DAO 窃取的以太币（ETH）今天将价值 66 亿美元。\n\n五年后的今天，对 DAO 的讨论再现江湖，DAO 也已经拥有一系列使用案例。我可以看到我身边关注的一些非常聪明的小伙伴已经在开始讨论 DAO，现在的 DAO 原生状态，有点 2020 年年初 NFT 的味道。\n\n我们早期布局 NFT 时，曾认为它是「区块链离现实落地最近的入口」，事实也证明它的确非常容易带来一些极大的关注度：短短三天时间，Meebits 在二级市场的总交易额便已高达 1.2 万 ETH，约合 4200 万美元，Uniswap 一双袜子卖 16 万美元，Jack Dorsey 一条推特五个单词拍出 250 万美元，Nynt Cat 第一个作品拍出 65.6 万美金，Beeple 在佳士得的 NFT 作品拍出 6935 万美金天价……\n\n但今天的 DAO 仿佛就晦涩难懂的多，那么到底什么是 DAO 呢？\n\n## 什么是 DAO？\n\nKevin Kelly 在《失控》里描述了蜂群的行为：当一群蜜蜂要搬家时，蜂王并不是直接做决定，而是一群蜜蜂前去侦察，回来之后，侦察蜂就对着蜂群跳舞表示结果。跳的舞越夸张，就说明越好。蜂群看到之后，就会又让另一些蜜蜂跟着去查看。如果也觉得好，也会回来一起跳舞。「通过这种反复强调，大家喜欢的地点就会吸引更多探访者，由此又会有更多的探访者加入进来。」\n\n最后最大的蜂群获胜，蜂王也随之迁居。在这个过程中，蜂王什么都没有做，只是跟着最大的蜂群而去，没有蜜蜂做出「最终决定」，但所有蜜蜂几乎都参与了决定。\n\n这就是蜂群思维，「『蜂群思维』的神奇在于，没有一只蜜蜂在控制它，但是有一只看不见的手，一只从大量愚钝的成员中涌现出来的手，控制着整个群体。」\n\n这就是原生的 DAO。\n\n考察 DAO 的定义，DAO（Decentralized Autonomous Organization）是一个去中心化的自治组织，它是围绕一个任务组织起来的团体，通过一套在区块链上执行的共享规则进行协调自治。\n\nDAO 将决策权交给利益相关者，而不是高管或董事会成员来实现 \"去中心化 \"；\"自治 \"则在于通过智能合约，使用户在可公开访问的区块链上运行的应用程序，若满足某些条件，就会自动触发相关行动和结果。\n\n这是「组织形态」上的变革和更新。\n\n我很喜欢 Jesse Walden 之前对 Defi 和 NFT 的一个总结：\n\nDefi: Money Legos\n\nNFT: Media Legos\n\n我认为 DAO 可能是 NFT 的上层，DAO 可以拥有 NFT 和创造 NFT，还能容纳很多非 NFT 的事。如果说 NFT 是「Media legos」，那 DAO 很可能是「Corporate legos」，这点和 Santi 的观点是不谋而合。\n\n\"就像今天的创作者粉丝群体一样，每个'公司'或项目将变得更像一个部落，由将其成员联系在一起的故事和符号来驱动和定义，而由那些最能编织其叙事的人领导。\"\n\n虽然，DAO 是「权力下放」的过程，但绝不能没有「权力中心」，那些抨击一个项目或者组织最终还是被某一小撮人控制的诟病，并不是 DAO 的缺陷。任何组织想要将决定和任务有条不紊进行下去，就一定有人决策，无论是前期还是后期，无论是有形还是无形，无论是群体还是个人。而 DAO 要解决的是权力的「分散性」和「流动性」，前者赋能项目参与者对项目的话语权，后者保证起决定性因素的领导者的不断更迭。\n\n在上一篇文章《后 NFT 时代》中，我提到了 Social Money 效应，如果说 Social Money 宣扬的更多是个人影响力的「Monertization」的过程，那 DAO 则是关于我们可以共同完成多少事情的宏伟命题。\n\n## DAO 的组织形态\n\n截至 5 月初，DAO 生态系统管理的总资产（根据 DeepDAO 数据）已经超越 10 亿美金，而且这一数据并没有把那些不以 DAO 形式运营或使用独立 DAO 架构的加密协议计算在内。「DAO 生态系统管理的总资产」和市场经济下「公司制管理的资产规模」意思类似，只是市场经济下的绝大多数资产都是由公司管理的，因此我们并不方便直接对比规模，但作为一种新型组织治理模式，「10 亿美元」这个规模足以成为 DAO 本身生态系统发展的一个标志。\n\nDAO 管理资产总量排行\n\nPolychain Capital 首席执行官兼创始人 Olaf Carlson-Wee 早前表示：「DAO 是风险资本未来，DAO 即将成为仅次于数字现金的区块链领域第二个重大突破。」\n\n当然这里的 DAO 划分可能过于「狭义」，并非所有 DAO 生态都是跟「管理资产」相关，DAO 的组织形态也有「基础设施」，「资管类别 DAO」，「治理 DAO」，「聚合器」，「Yield DAO」，「Guild」，「Creator&Media DAO」，「DAO Adaptor」八个类别分别阐述。\n\n基础设施层面，DAO 已逐渐成为 Web3 基础结构的重要组成部分，像 Aragon，DAOstack，Moloch 等各种 DAO 协议的不断发展，为想要发起，治理，管理 DAO 的组织提供了巨大便利。比如，Aragon 提供了一站式的工具和服务，将社区、事业等变成一个经济体，释放出一个长尾 DAO 组织形态。相比于 Aragon 的复杂，Moloch 是以「残酷的极简主义」的设计理念建造的，目的是创建一个「最小可行的 DAO」，可以让人们为一个共同的目标，分配共享资源的同时积极地将不良因素的攻击降低至最小化。\n\n资管类别层面，正占据着目前 DAO 市场极大份额，即 Venture DAO，这里指的是「以投资为导向」的 DAO 组织，比如 Metacartel，The LAO 等，但也有以发放「Grant」的投资组织比如 Moloch，Marketing DAO 等。\n\nVenture DAO 与传统基金不同的是，机构和高净值个人（有限合伙人或 LPs）将资金投入基金，其他人（普通合伙人或 GPs）将资金投入公司，DAO 的投资者将能够根据智能合约中预先设定的规则对提案进行投票。每个人的投票都由他们持有的代币数量加权，而代币数量是基于他们的投资额。如果一个提议的项目获得了足够的票数，智能合约会自动触发 The DAO 的资金投资到项目的 ETH 钱包，当然这是理想化的 Venture DAO 形态，很多的 DAO 依旧还处于「渐进式去中心化」状态（详见下一章节）。\n\n值得一提的是，目前 Venture DAO 在 NFT 赛道当中亮眼表现，如下图罗列的 WHALE，FlamingoDAO，PleasrDAO，Jenny Metaverse DAO 等都是专注于投资 NFT 资产的 DAO 组织。4 月 19 日，PleasrDAO 以 2224 枚 ETH 打败竞争对手，成功拍得斯诺登首个 NFT 作品「Stay Free」，Jenny Metaverse DAO 也于近期成功完成 700 万美金的募资，而 WHALE 创始人 WhaleShark 也反复表示对于 WHALE 从一而终的理念是「WhaleShark out, DAO up!」，这一切似乎也在逐步验证 Matt Huang 的那句话「The next Berkshire Hathaway will begin as a DAO.」\n\n治理（Governance）类型 DAO，是除了投资类型 DAO 之外，极其重要的一个组成部分，正如前文提到的，DAO 是组织「权力下放」的过程，用户通过持有资产的比例决定了投票权重，投票权重又直接影响了决策的方向（关于 DAO 的决策将会在下下一章节《靠谱度加权和极致透明畅想》展开探讨），而这一决策则是由诸如 Snapshot，Tally，Gnosis SAFE 等治理工具实现的。当然，一个项目可能有多种属性和标签，比如 Aragon 除了基础设施之外也是治理工具。「聚合器」类别的 DAO 也往往带有投票治理的功能。\n\n至于后面的几种组织形态，Yield DAO，是汇集资产后协同赚取 DeFi 收益的类别，Barn DAO，PieDAO，BadgerDAO 等在 DAO 资产沉淀类别当中也一直处于前列。\n\nGuild DAO 则像是一种公会治理，比如 Yield Guild Games（YGG），它是一个游戏公会，各地玩家可以通过公会聚集在一起通过各类游戏的边玩边赚机制赚取游戏收益。传统区块链游戏中，尤其是 NFT 游戏，往往需要用户先持有 NFT 资产才可以进入游戏，而类似 YGG 这样的公会机构可以帮用户免去购买资产的过程，将资产的所有权和使用权分离达到各方共赢的状态。Raid Guild 和 Rabbithole 则类似于「任务众包」的组织，前者是通过聚集区块链专业人士提供「咨询」，「公关」，「设计」，「开发」等服务，后者则是面向 C 端，用户可通过玩 dapp 等任务而赚取收益。Metafactory 则是属于业务型的 DAO, 专注于数字&实体时尚品牌的孵化平台。\n\nCreator DAO 和 Media DAO 是近期新生的 DAO 组织，自千禧一代成为社会主力之后，Passion Economy 和 Creator Economy 逐渐兴起。从资本的角度来看，也有种从 VC 到 Community Capital 再到 Solo Capital 的趋势，这些其实都是「个人影响力」发酵的结果。而像 Mirrior 这样的新生创作者社区将模块最小化，但将个人影响力最大化，从个人影响力辐射到 NFT（商品），或到 Crowdfund（募资），我认为这也是非常前卫的探索。\n\n总结来看，本质上，任何具有 DAO 治理和管理的自治组织都可以称为 DAO，所以 DAO 更像是一个「可组合模块」渗透到各类项目当中去，这类生态组成在此定义为「DAO Adaptor」，其中大家熟悉的项目包括 Uniswap，MakerDAO，AAVE，Compound，YFI，Aavegotchi，Decentraland 等都是 DAO 组织的先行者。\n\nDAO 不是自上而下的等级结构，而是使用 Web3 技术和快速发展的治理和激励系统，来分配决策权和财务奖励。上述各种组织形态可能过于复杂，个人觉得简单来说，除了基础设施类别之外，DAO 其实是一种为项目融资（Venture DAO）、治理社区（Governence DAO）和分享价值（Creator DAO）的新型组合方式。\n\n## 渐进式去中心化\n\n在笔者研究 NFT，DAO，Social Token，Passion Economy，Creator Economy 的时候，常常会围观 NotBoring Packy McCormick 和 Variant Fund Jesse Walden 的观点。我第一次读到 Packy 文章时，我和我闺蜜的原话是「Shit, he is literally reading my mind…...」, 豪不夸张得讲，他是我想藏起来独享的宝藏博主，而 Jesse 的文章则会是给到我更多发散性的启发（两位都强烈推荐）。「渐进式去中心化」就是由 Jesse Walden 提出的概念，他认为：「加密货币公司不必，而且一般来说不应该从第一天起就成为一个 DAO，它们可以不断发展。」\n\n过于固守事物本来的形态，往往无法真正了解事物的本质，不管是包装还是归类的「定义」都是服务于「更好阐述产品本身」，而非用来限制「产品本身」。DAO 也是如此。\n\n从中心化过渡到去中心化，关键在于革新是否有助于产品本身，以及产品现有阶段是否适合这种革新？如果两者的答案都是 yes，才有推行下去的必要。创业途中，不断通过 demo 与用户测试交流，形成良好的反馈闭环，这样才能不断完善产品本身，好的产品需要试验和反馈，而绝不是创始人在家看完《失控》，预测未来 50 年的战略大局，然后纸上谈兵。好的产品，必须与其所处环境，紧密联系，共同进化。\n\n那该如何逐步完成一个去中心化的治理框架，从而\"建立一个可持续的、合规的和社区拥有的产品\"呢？\n\nWalden 给了我们三个步骤，我认为大家有必要一起来探讨一下：\n\n1. 产品与市场的契合\n\n加密货币初创公司的初期应该看起来像任何初创公司的初期：一个小而精的团队专注地将所有精力投入到构建，学习和迭代中，直到找到适合市场的产品。如果产品很烂，最终都是会脱离社区的。Web3 初创企业实际上在这里极具优势，通过将现有的智能合约，代码和产品整合到新的合约中来快速构建和测试，可以完成极快的试错过程。DeFi 之所以被称为「Money Legos」，是每当有人构建新的东西时，其即可直接成为可供他人使用的模块，魔术的诞生除了创造乐高之外，还有重构乐高的组合模式。\n\nAavegotchi 是我接触团队中最注重 DAO 化的团队之一，从提案，到投票，到 discord/twitter 等社交媒体的社交网图映射到项目的贡献权重值中，无一例外都在践行 DAO 化。但它也逃脱不了「渐进式 DAO」化的过程：前期的定调是由团队决定，而后期的重大决策则都是由社区决定。我深刻记得在第一次传送门发售之后，大家投票第二次传送门的发售在 Snapshot 被投票延迟之后，就连团队都惊讶于「在第一期稀有度挖矿之前，没有二期传送门」最终的结果，但是一个好产品的诞生难道不该是由「市场」来决定嘛？\n\n1. 社区参与\n\n一旦公司实现了产品与市场的契合，就应该开始尝试使更多的利益相关者更直接地参与其中。Walden 将其比作「开源开发」，邀请社区参与，提供赏金，赠款和其他激励措施，在开放的环境中发展，建立社区，并就决策达成初步共识。\n\n在这一点上，我最欣赏的国内团队是 Conflux，他们虽然还没有过渡到完全的去中心化，但其在「原始的任务众包」中已经做的非常体系化了。他们的 Bounty 计划，按照「技术」，「品牌「，」社群「，「资源」，「其他」几个维度向开放社区征集有识之士，每个任务都清晰罗列，相关人员可直接去认领，从而让更多的利益相关者能参与到生态构建上来。\n\nThe Sandbox 的体素创作者社区当中也是一个「原生的 DAO」，艺术家们每一段时间会根据相应主题形成几类分组，每个分组按照之前作品权重集成划分出相应小组长，小组长会指导成员并保证创作过程的稳步进行，一切都有规则，但权利又是「流动」的。\n\n上述例子其实和我们开篇 DAO 的分类中的 Guild 分类是一致，但是由于 DAO 的渐进式过程，项目都还是以「类原始」方式运行，而后阶段若过渡到完全 DAO 治理之后，可扩展性则会是指数型增长。\n\n1. 充分的权力下放\n\n完成前两个步骤后，接踵而至的是「完成 DAO 决策，并自动执行」。拆解之后我们要关注的，一是 Voting power，二是自动执行。Voting Power 目前大多是取决于持有的币数，但这一部分有很多人诟病核心团队或者大户可能会根据他们在社区中的地位或持有的代币数量来影响决策，针对于这点的问题和解决方案，我们将在下一章节详细探讨。自动执行则是通过触发智能合约预设的规则来铸造和分配代币，这些规则决定了从今天谁得到多少，将来代币将如何分配等。\n\n这样项目的未来发展就掌握在社区手中，这也是是众多项目目前最需要「渐进式去中心化」的关键原因，早前笔者问 WhaleShark 的时候，问及 WHALE 的 DAO 方案为何还是在 Discord 发起，而不是部署在任何 DAO 的基建上，他的回答是目前的 DAO 方案都还不够完善，很多 DAO 方案内容是复杂的，目前市面上没有一款产品能够让方案通过了就可以无需人工自动执行。而 Voting power 也存在上述提到的诸多问题。\n\n一个忠诚的社区加上有效的治理，会有效促进产品和市场达到一个完美契合度，而这也可能是完成 DAO 创新最行之有效的方式。\n\n## 靠谱度加权和极致透明畅想\n\n上一章节中遗留了一个问题：「目前大部分的 DAO 治理都是通过持有代币数量的多少来决定 Voting Power」，但这种就很容易陷入大户或者少部分人的集中性控制弊病。有人将「同票同权」的决策方式称之为「单细胞民主」，是伪民主，追求个体的绝对民主不一定是决策的最优解，那要如何保证民主和独权的平衡并保持策略的均纳什平衡呢？\n\n「我的目标是和我共事的人一起做有意义的工作，建立有意义的关系。我知道只有极度的透明和算法式的决策机制才能帮我实现这个目标。」---Ray Dalio\n\n靠谱度加权（believability-weighted）和极致透明（radical transparency）来源于桥水基金的决策模式，虽然 Dalio 不是 big fan of bitcion，但是桥水的公司决策模式却意外极具 DAO 化。\n\n在 DAO 决策中，我听到最多的反对意见就是，「一群人是没法做决策的」，除了代币代表的「stake」之外，还有什么「维度」可以用来加权吗？或者说人数多就代表绝对正确吗？大户/鲸鱼就代表绝对正确吗？答案显而易见是否定的，那是否可以按照「靠谱度加权」思路进行改善呢？\n\n靠谱度加权，简单来说就是你这个人如果靠谱，那么你说的意见分量就重一点；如果你这人不靠谱，那分量则会弱一些。这个道理看起来简单，但实施起来却不是易事，这也是为什么桥水的治理常被人称为「邪教文化」。\n\n「Dot Collector」是桥水来实现靠谱度加权的工具，员工可通过 strategic thinking（策略化思考）、dealing with ambiguity（对模糊化情况的处理能力）等不同维度给其他人打分，分数范围为 1 到 10 分，7 分为平均水平。\n\n所有的点评，比如打分人的 ID、分数、追加的附言评语都会被永久保存。每一个点评被称为一个 dot，某个人身上可能挂满了 dot，比如桥水的联席 CIO 身上就挂了约有 11000 多个点。各项维度最终集成为你的「靠谱度」（believability）。而在决策过程中，我们就可以通过靠谱度进行加权。\n\n（每个人按照靠谱度权重的颜色画像）\n\n「创意择优=极度求真+极度透明+可信度加权的决策。」\n\n回到我们的 DAO 治理当中来，我们以 Venture DAO 为例，最简单「靠谱度加权」方式就是追踪投资人的每次投资决策来形成他的「投资靠谱度」，从而在下一次的投资中会形成不同的权重（这部分若要衍生则要扩展到 DID 部分的探讨）。\n\n这就是桥水倡导的「创见上的贤人政治」（idea meritocracy），通过靠谱度加权（believability-weighted）的方式来达到追求「极端透明」（radical transparency），从而达成最佳决策。\n\n当然 DAO 的决策的成功不仅仅是「靠谱度加权」就足够了，Charlene Li 在《Open Leadership》一书中用：解释说明 (Explaining)，日常工作知会 (Updating)，自由对话 (Conversing)，公开发表意见 (Open Mic)，内部众包（Crowdsourcing)，统一信息平台 (Platform) 六个方面来阐述了企业内部开放沟通的行为特征和实现方式，笔者觉得也有借鉴意义（章节问题就不过多阐述了）。\n\n企业到 DAO 组织的过程，即是上述几个维度不断从封闭式专项开放式的过程。\n\n## NFT 的今天 DAO 的明天\n\n就像 NFT 一样，DAO 现在的早期实验可能只代表其未来潜力的一小部分。随着更多的 DAO 工具的出现，尝试创新变得越来越容易，而 DAO Legos 也不断在填充，不仅仅是应用层，在监管上 DAO 也有很大进展。\n\n今年 4 月，美国怀俄明州立法机构颁布了 Vermont Bill For blockchain 立法，通过了 DAOs 的合法性提案，它将允许 DAO 作为有限责任公司成立。对 DAO 来说，这可能是向前迈出的巨大一步，法案将允许 DAO 在链上操作、资产代理和管理其事务，这无疑也为 DAO 的可扩展性铺平了道路。\n\n在进入 DAO 这个 Rabbit Hole 之后，我一直期待看到这个领域还有什么有意思的创意以及上述的激励模型要如何反哺到项目本身。\n\n「The next big thing will start out looking like a toy」，我相信 NFT 的今天，将会是 DAO 的明天。", "timestamp": 1635143545,

{"id": "1pnHEkElo_32A5eBLNTbMg_o1zHGgJaRg3zDzsj4T9g", "title": "关于画音的一些想法", "body": " 1. 人类通信的诉求，可以分成「结构化信息传递」「复刻现实」。在这两方面，经典的事件是「文字出现」和「话筒出现」。前者成为近几千年，人类都在努力做好的一件事情，关乎人类的存亡、继承和发展；而后者伴随着在电话上的应用，彻底打破了空间对于沟通的阻隔，让跨越空间的复刻现实成为可能。\n 2. 结构化信息表达自古至今，依然只有少部分人可以做到；而复刻现实是一个更普适的诉求和能力。 \n \n 3. 通信技术的发展是一个二者交替发展的过程，1G到2G是在复刻现实的基础上实现了结构化信息的快速传输，每条140字的短信是一个重要变化；2G到3G实现了彩信的能力，图像的传播成为一种复刻现实的表现；3G到4G促进了移动互联网的繁荣，POI、交易、短视频等结构化信息得到快速的传播。\n 4. 微信是一个跨越通信时代的产品（3G到4G），同时也很好地融合了用户的两类通信的诉求。3G时代实现语音对讲和照片传输，足以让他替代短信这一类的并不普适的通信产品，事实上，截至去年受过大学专科、大学本科及以上教育的网民占比也仅为为8.7%和9.9%。这种复刻现实的能力让更多用户可以通过微信，与其他人产生互动。\n 5. 每一个通信时代都需要一个恰到好处的输入方式，比如笔、话筒、摄像头、键盘，输入过程同时也是编码过程。\n 6. 直播繁荣在4G的尾巴上，是一种复刻现实的通讯方式。人们通过直播将自己的生活、表演分享给其他远在异地的朋友。\n 7. 从下一条开始认真聊聊画音。\n 8. \n 9. 以上铺垫并不是想说直播和画音会成为5G时代的主流沟通方式。事实上语音对讲、视频分享和实时通话基本上可以满足人们对于复刻现实的诉求了。\n10. 直播在接下来可能会成为更普遍的一种信息传递方式，只不过目标可能是对于特定领域的现实复刻，譬如教育、卖场、观光。进一步地复刻现实对结构化信息传递产生了增益价值，比如情感价值、信任价值。\n11. 回过头来看画音，其实完成的是对摄像头语言的一种抽象方式，面向的是人与人之间的面对面沟通场景。\n12. 决定大家是否持续使用画音的决定性因素是这种复刻现实的方式，是否有助于促进某些特定关系的发生、维护和沉淀，如闺蜜群、家人群和恋人之间。\n13. 主观感受下来，是有可能的，但可能频次比较低，这里像极了小姐妹们在某个慵懒的下午才会去吃的下午茶餐厅，产生了很多对话，但是更适合表达情绪和感受，不适合传递结构化的信息，也不适合做信息沉淀。\n14. 画音的story表现出了一定服务于这种关系的特征，分享书籍、分享美妆、健身的内容不断出现在这里。如果继续往后延伸，story是否可能成为和直播互相补充的表达方式呢？ \n \n15. 我始终认为，「派对」也应该是复刻现实的场景，把多人互动进行复刻。在语音领域，这种现实场景线上化的过程已经在悄悄进行了，游戏厅、相亲房、K歌厅，期待画音在这方面做出探索。\n16. 有一说一，画音的对手可能真的不是微信。而是服务于某个关系的社交场所，这样可能更容易做出价值。 \n \n17. 最后，5G时代需要更好的输入方式和传感方式，才能进一步完成复刻现实的目的。目前我们还没看到标准答案。", "timestamp": 1635143882, "digest": "LSt-ztA-gNauXzqHz0Vg1noFrEhzLsSru2f6C0uKf7g", "contributor": "0xd04fCd032793791EB1e9eff06C351F4eFF4c90D2"}

Project Catalyst （去中心化基金-DAO）让 Cardano 社区决定生态系统增长的重要优先事项。ADA 越高，财政部将拥有更多的资金。因此，Cardano 拥有一个强大的去中心化启动平台，其治理系统用于分配宝贵的资金。\n\n### ADA Token\n\n* Ticker: ADA.\n* Blockchain: Cardano.\n* Consensus: Proof of Stake (PoS).\n* Algorithm: Ouroboros.\n* Token Type: Coin.\n* Smallest unit: 1 Lovelace = 10^-6 ADA.\n* Max Supply: 45,000,000,000 ADA.\n* Circulating Supply: 32,143,026,588 ADA.\n* All-time low ATL: $0.017 (1/10/2017).\n* Exchanges: Binance, Huobi, Kucoin, Gate, Coinbase, etc.\n\n### \n\n### Cardano 路线图\n\n在整个 Cardano 的路线图中，共分为 5 大步，分别是拜伦（Byron）、雪莱（Shelley）、古根（Goguen）、芭蕉（Basho）和伏尔泰（Voltaire），它们分别代表了公链技术基础、质押激励、智能合约、优化性能和链上治理，而我们目前所处的就是代表了智能合约时代的古根（Goguen）。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VsmtmMw5jyNSTeSKcPiEC.png?height=1406&width=2500)\n\n### Cardano 的公链模型\n\nCardano 的模型通过创建扩展的 UTXO 模型（eUTXO）回归到行业的根源。它本质上是一个 UTXO，但具有两个附加功能——维护合约状态的能力和用于整个事务序列上的执行相同合约代码的能力。eUTXO 为交易添加了自定义数据和值，这允许任意逻辑与这些交易进行交互并打开智能合约的大门。\n\n### 共识机制\n\n#### 权益证明\n\nOuroboros 是一种基于权益证明 (PoS) 的加密货币免许可共识机制。它在 Cardano 区块链上实现，并带有一种称为 ADA 的加密货币。PoS 中的验证者不使用像 BTC 的 PoW 这样的矿工网络，而是使用他们的 ADA 股份参与验证和验证交易。\n\n所有做出贡献的验证者都会获得 ADA 奖励，而那些将其 ADA 代币委托给权益池的验证者也会获得与其权益相关的奖励。ADA 持有者可以参与对未来功能的投票，例如 Project Catalyst 投票。\n\nHydra(二层扩容方案) 是 Cardano 改变游戏规则的可扩展性解决方案，这意味着每秒交易 (TPS) 可高达 100 万。它借助 UTxO 技术使 Cardano 成为一个稳定的全球系统。\n\nCardano 量子证明使用 Sha-256 加密哈希函数，它允许任意长度的输入成为固定长度的输出。此外，输入是不可能从输出哈希中导出的。\n\n特别是，为了针对其他区块链上的速度和扩展问题提供最佳解决方案，Cardano 区块链分为两个主要层：\n\n* 结算层：该层的工作原理类似于包含由 Cardano PoS 协议验证的所有历史交易的分类帐。\n* 计算层：在卡尔达诺上运行的 DApp 层，实施智能合约。\n\n## 一些相关名词解释\n\n### Haskell\n\nHaskell是一种函数语言，对比于常用的 C/C++/Java/Python等 Imperative Langauge。 Imperative Language是以statement为主，把要做的工作描述在程序里，由电脑按步就班的执行。 Functional Language 是以构建函数为主，就像是数学证明一样，每一个函数会回复一些值（或函数），而函数可能参考到其他函数，由此组成完整的功能。\n\n### Plutus\n\nPlutus 是 Haskell 加上区块链和Smart Contract 的功能。\n\n## 生态系统\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dCJVwQxhgU8IWqrxIIgKP.png?height=338&width=600)\n\n#### 去中心化交易所\n\n**[Minswap](https://minswap.org/)**\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第四季度\n\n简介：2021 年 9 月 1 日，Cardno 测试网首先进行了阿朗佐硬分叉。不久之后，一个崭露头角的去中心化交易所「Minswap」于 9 月 3 日推出了他们的测试网，成为第一个部署在 Cardano 上的 Dapp。\n\n**[Cardaswap](https://cardaswap.finance/)**\n\n简介：在 Cardano 区块链上交换、赚取和构建下一代 DEX。在对所有人开放且可访问的金融市场中进行交易、搭建桥梁并成为流动性提供者。\n\n**[Cardax](https://cardax.io/)**\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第四季度\n\n简介：Cardax 是一个去中心化交易所，允许用户用 ADA 交易任何 Cardano 链上的原生代币。\n\n**[Yayswap](https://yayswap.io/)**\n\n跨链桥测试网：<https://yayswap.io/bridge/>\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第四季度\n\n简介：Cardano 区块链上的第一个高性能去中心化交易平台。\n\n**[Ergodex](https://ergodex.io/)**\n\n测试网：<https://beta.ergodex.io/>\n\n简介：ErgoDEX 是一个非托管的、去中心化的交易所，允许在 Ergo 和 Cardano 网络之间快速、轻松和安全地转移流动性。\n\n**[Adax](https://adax.pro/)**\n\n简介：ADAX 是一种自动化流动性协议，以完全去中心化和非托管的方式促进 Cardano 生态系统内的交易。\n\n**[Sundaeswap](https://www.sundaeswap.finance/)**\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第三季度\n\n简介：Cardano 区块链上的原生、可扩展的去中心化交易所\n\n#### 借贷\n\n**[Meld](https://www.meld.com/)**\n\n发布时间：预计 2021 年第三季度\n\n简介：MELD 是 Cardano 上第一个用于借贷法定货币和加密货币的去中心化、非托管协议\n\n**[Aada](https://medium.com/@aada.finance)**\n\n简介：Aada 是 Cardano 上的加密资产借贷平台。智能合约允许存入资产并收取利息或借入资产并执行财务操作。\n\n**[Liqwid Finance](https://www.liqwid.finance/)**\n\n简介：个基于流动性提供者供应和借款人需求的利率曲线算法和非托管流动性协议。\n\n#### 合成资产平台\n\n**[Indigo Protocol](https://indigoprotocol.io/)**\n\n上线时间：2021 年 10 月\n\n简介：Indigo 是一种基于 Cardano 的算法、自主合成协议，用于对现实世界资产进行链上价格敞口。\n\n#### 衍生品市场\n\n**[Matrixswap](https://www.matrixswap.io/)**\n\n简介：是一个部署在 Polkadot、Cardano、Polygon 上的去中心化多链永续合约平台。\n\n#### 去中心化保险\n\n**[Ensuro](https://ensuro.co/aboutus.html)**\n\n简介：未有更多进展。\n\n#### NFT/ 链游\n\n**[Bondly （多链）](https://www.bondly.finance/default)**\n\n简介：Bondly 将通过加密项目、品牌和艺术家为下一代数字收藏品提供动力。\n\n**[Adazoo NFT](https://www.adazoo.com/)**\n\n上线时间：预计第三季度末\n\n简介：ADAZOO 是在 Cardano 区块链上运行的首批基于 NFT 的游戏之一。\n\n**[Cnft](https://cnft.io/)**\n\n简介：是 Cardano 上的 NFT 交易市场。\n\n**[Sushibytes](https://www.sushibyte.io/)**\n\n上线时间：预计 2021 年秋季\n\n简介：是在 Cardano 区块链上运行的首批基于 NFT 的游戏之一。\n\n**[Artano](https://artano.io/)**\n\n简介：是 Cardano 区块链上的一个全球社区驱动的 NFT 市场。\n\n参考资料：\n\n> 1.

Project Catalyst （去中心化基金-DAO）让 Cardano 社区决定生态系统增长的重要优先事项。ADA 越高，财政部将拥有更多的资金。因此，Cardano 拥有一个强大的去中心化启动平台，其治理系统用于分配宝贵的资金。\n\n### ADA Token\n\n* Ticker: ADA.\n* Blockchain: Cardano.\n* Consensus: Proof of Stake (PoS).\n* Algorithm: Ouroboros.\n* Token Type: Coin.\n* Smallest unit: 1 Lovelace = 10^-6 ADA.\n* Max Supply: 45,000,000,000 ADA.\n* Circulating Supply: 32,143,026,588 ADA.\n* All-time low ATL: $0.017 (1/10/2017).\n* Exchanges: Binance, Huobi, Kucoin, Gate, Coinbase, etc.\n\n### \n\n### Cardano 路线图\n\n在整个 Cardano 的路线图中，共分为 5 大步，分别是拜伦（Byron）、雪莱（Shelley）、古根（Goguen）、芭蕉（Basho）和伏尔泰（Voltaire），它们分别代表了公链技术基础、质押激励、智能合约、优化性能和链上治理，而我们目前所处的就是代表了智能合约时代的古根（Goguen）。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VsmtmMw5jyNSTeSKcPiEC.png?height=1406&width=2500)\n\n### Cardano 的公链模型\n\nCardano 的模型通过创建扩展的 UTXO 模型（eUTXO）回归到行业的根源。它本质上是一个 UTXO，但具有两个附加功能——维护合约状态的能力和用于整个事务序列上的执行相同合约代码的能力。eUTXO 为交易添加了自定义数据和值，这允许任意逻辑与这些交易进行交互并打开智能合约的大门。\n\n### 共识机制\n\n#### 权益证明\n\nOuroboros 是一种基于权益证明 (PoS) 的加密货币免许可共识机制。它在 Cardano 区块链上实现，并带有一种称为 ADA 的加密货币。PoS 中的验证者不使用像 BTC 的 PoW 这样的矿工网络，而是使用他们的 ADA 股份参与验证和验证交易。\n\n所有做出贡献的验证者都会获得 ADA 奖励，而那些将其 ADA 代币委托给权益池的验证者也会获得与其权益相关的奖励。ADA 持有者可以参与对未来功能的投票，例如 Project Catalyst 投票。\n\nHydra(二层扩容方案) 是 Cardano 改变游戏规则的可扩展性解决方案，这意味着每秒交易 (TPS) 可高达 100 万。它借助 UTxO 技术使 Cardano 成为一个稳定的全球系统。\n\nCardano 量子证明使用 Sha-256 加密哈希函数，它允许任意长度的输入成为固定长度的输出。此外，输入是不可能从输出哈希中导出的。\n\n特别是，为了针对其他区块链上的速度和扩展问题提供最佳解决方案，Cardano 区块链分为两个主要层：\n\n* 结算层：该层的工作原理类似于包含由 Cardano PoS 协议验证的所有历史交易的分类帐。\n* 计算层：在卡尔达诺上运行的 DApp 层，实施智能合约。\n\n## 一些相关名词解释\n\n### Haskell\n\nHaskell是一种函数语言，对比于常用的 C/C++/Java/Python等 Imperative Langauge。 Imperative Language是以statement为主，把要做的工作描述在程序里，由电脑按步就班的执行。 Functional Language 是以构建函数为主，就像是数学证明一样，每一个函数会回复一些值（或函数），而函数可能参考到其他函数，由此组成完整的功能。\n\n### Plutus\n\nPlutus 是 Haskell 加上区块链和Smart Contract 的功能。\n\n## 生态系统\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dCJVwQxhgU8IWqrxIIgKP.png?height=338&width=600)\n\n#### 去中心化交易所\n\n**[Minswap](https://minswap.org/)**\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第四季度\n\n简介：2021 年 9 月 1 日，Cardno 测试网首先进行了阿朗佐硬分叉。不久之后，一个崭露头角的去中心化交易所「Minswap」于 9 月 3 日推出了他们的测试网，成为第一个部署在 Cardano 上的 Dapp。\n\n**[Cardaswap](https://cardaswap.finance/)**\n\n简介：在 Cardano 区块链上交换、赚取和构建下一代 DEX。在对所有人开放且可访问的金融市场中进行交易、搭建桥梁并成为流动性提供者。\n\n**[Cardax](https://cardax.io/)**\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第四季度\n\n简介：Cardax 是一个去中心化交易所，允许用户用 ADA 交易任何 Cardano 链上的原生代币。\n\n**[Yayswap](https://yayswap.io/)**\n\n跨链桥测试网：<https://yayswap.io/bridge/>\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第四季度\n\n简介：Cardano 区块链上的第一个高性能去中心化交易平台。\n\n**[Ergodex](https://ergodex.io/)**\n\n测试网：<https://beta.ergodex.io/>\n\n简介：ErgoDEX 是一个非托管的、去中心化的交易所，允许在 Ergo 和 Cardano 网络之间快速、轻松和安全地转移流动性。\n\n**[Adax](https://adax.pro/)**\n\n简介：ADAX 是一种自动化流动性协议，以完全去中心化和非托管的方式促进 Cardano 生态系统内的交易。\n\n**[Sundaeswap](https://www.sundaeswap.finance/)**\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第三季度\n\n简介：Cardano 区块链上的原生、可扩展的去中心化交易所\n\n#### 借贷\n\n**[Meld](https://www.meld.com/)**\n\n发布时间：预计 2021 年第三季度\n\n简介：MELD 是 Cardano 上第一个用于借贷法定货币和加密货币的去中心化、非托管协议\n\n**[Aada](https://medium.com/@aada.finance)**\n\n简介：Aada 是 Cardano 上的加密资产借贷平台。智能合约允许存入资产并收取利息或借入资产并执行财务操作。\n\n**[Liqwid Finance](https://www.liqwid.finance/)**\n\n简介：个基于流动性提供者供应和借款人需求的利率曲线算法和非托管流动性协议。\n\n#### 合成资产平台\n\n**[Indigo Protocol](https://indigoprotocol.io/)**\n\n上线时间：2021 年 10 月\n\n简介：Indigo 是一种基于 Cardano 的算法、自主合成协议，用于对现实世界资产进行链上价格敞口。\n\n#### 衍生品市场\n\n**[Matrixswap](https://www.matrixswap.io/)**\n\n简介：是一个部署在 Polkadot、Cardano、Polygon 上的去中心化多链永续合约平台。\n\n#### 去中心化保险\n\n**[Ensuro](https://ensuro.co/aboutus.html)**\n\n简介：未有更多进展。\n\n#### NFT/ 链游\n\n**[Bondly （多链）](https://www.bondly.finance/default)**\n\n简介：Bondly 将通过加密项目、品牌和艺术家为下一代数字收藏品提供动力。\n\n**[Adazoo NFT](https://www.adazoo.com/)**\n\n上线时间：预计第三季度末\n\n简介：ADAZOO 是在 Cardano 区块链上运行的首批基于 NFT 的游戏之一。\n\n**[Cnft](https://cnft.io/)**\n\n简介：是 Cardano 上的 NFT 交易市场。\n\n**[Sushibytes](https://www.sushibyte.io/)**\n\n上线时间：预计 2021 年秋季\n\n简介：是在 Cardano 区块链上运行的首批基于 NFT 的游戏之一。\n\n**[Artano](https://artano.io/)**\n\n简介：是 Cardano 区块链上的一个全球社区驱动的 NFT 市场。\n\n参考资料：\n\n> 1.

We’ve aggregated everything we know about reward design from discussions with multiple DAOs, and combined that with information about compensation in traditional businesses.* \n\n*As a DAO contributor, you can use this guide to help understand what options you have. As a DAO community engineer, you can use this document to design general guidance for your community. **There’s also benchmarks in the Appendix.***\n\n*This article is for regular contributors and community engineers / builders. If you are just starting your DAO journey, [take a peek over here instead!](https://creators.mirror.xyz/862A5rBtKX3BC8eEircDnGwPIJJTJ33hn-MvnukByPc)*\n\n\n---\n\n## It’s all incentives? Always has been.\n\n> *Bobby logged into the server. Today the contributors had an important discussion pending: bounties and contributor rewards. As part of the conversation, Bobby had to help reach consensus on benchmark bounty rewards and a proposal for ongoing payments for regular contributors (incl. part-time and full-time). However, Bobby wasn't sure how to go about this - What were other communities doing? What incentives should they use to support their overall mission? Should the community allocate tokens or USDC?*\n\n[https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1448615205877989379?s=20](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1448615205877989379?s=20)\n\nThere’s a Bobby in every DAO, striving to help make contributor rewards ***transparent***, ***decentralized***, ***fair***, and ***sustainable***. After all, incentives run the world and can make or break an organization.\n\nThat being said, these are very early days. A variety of new rewards will likely emerge over the next few years - just like NFT status symbols were popularized last summer. **This reward recipe book should be considered intermediary guidance** while we discover new rewards inspired by game design, and incorporating novel ownership mechanisms.\n\n> *💡 Quick Note: We will exclude token appreciation, community-wide disbursements (e.g. airdrops) and reputation in this article. We will likely take a look at these topics in other articles related to community engagement design.*\n\n## Recipes not Instructions\n\nIt can be tempting as a community genesis member or guild veteran to try and define a clear set of instructions. Creating static company-wide policies is how most of us have done it in traditional organizations. It’s like a warm weighted blanket - a feeling of comfort in certainty.\n\n[https://twitter.com/MichaelaOkla/status/1110261724223930368?s=20](https://twitter.com/MichaelaOkla/status/1110261724223930368?s=20)\n\nHowever, we’re in a different ecosystem with **ambiguity, volatility, constant change, and an opportunity for artistic experimentation**. As a result of this dynamic space, it’s probably best to think about community guidance as contextual (artistic!) recipes while encouraging individual members and guilds to find the right solutions for their context.\n\n[https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1447592927748837384?s=20](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1447592927748837384?s=20)\n\n## What is a “Reward” anyways?\n\nRewards can mean a variety of different things.\n\nAt Cabin, when we use the term Reward, we mean \"pay for eligible work\". When we mention “pay”, we mean rewards in the form of liquid ownership. In other words, rewards should:\n\n1. **Liquid**: Be useful for rent and food\n2. **Ownership**: Distribute governance power of the community\n\nThe latter is critical, as without it we run the risk of developing negative aspects of the [gig economy.](https://qz.com/1556194/the-gig-economy-is-quietly-undermining-a-century-of-worker-protections/)\n\nAt at a top level, we believe a good reward recipe book covers the following steps:\n\n1. Reward Principles: What’s the north star?\n2. Reward Eligibility: Who should we reward?\n3. Reward Structure: What should we reward, under what terms?\n4. Reward Amount: How much should we reward?\n5. Reward Consensus: How do we agree on the reward?\n\n![Five steps to explore reward options for yourself and your community](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BWA1xUO9sMhj1FexPz3L9.png?height=806&width=1440)\n\n## STEP 1 - Reward Principles: What’s the north star?\n\nThere are a lot of options in terms of who could get rewarded, what to reward, and how to distribute rewards. Spending some time thinking about decision-making guardrails can help narrow down the design space. In HR-speak, these are usually called “Design Principles” and “Design Practices”.\n\nHere’s an example from Warcamp (DAOHaus):\n\n![Source: Contributor Compensation Revamp Proposal, DAOhaus Core Contributors](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wlFILCY7FmDqV_G431d4D.PNG?height=470&width=1208)\n\n**Design Principles** should definitely vary across communities and over time. Over time, they reflect changes in membership, and most importantly, the evolution of the mission and focus. Some examples include:\n\n* Consistency, Flexibility, Collaboration, Alignment, Transparency, Simplicity, Ownership, Sustainability, Fairness, Decentralization, Predictability, Efficiency, Automation.\n\nOptimizing for one principle can mean decreasing focus on others. However, this doesn’t have to be the case given all the new technology we have at our disposal.\n\n[https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1451103939374592000?s=20](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1451103939374592000?s=20)\n\nIn addition to choosing basic principles, it’s useful to define **Design Practices**. This is the translation of principles into expected operational actions. Here are a few examples that help with the design process:\n\n1. **We will design rewards with inclusive collaboration as a core value:** This means testing rewards for accessibility, diversity, teamwork, and mutual generosity.\n2. **We will review rewards regularly:** For new DAOs this might be weekly or monthly. For more mature DAOs a Seasonal review probably is more appropriate.\n3. **We will keep it simple:** Making reward recommendations easily understandable by contributors helps them focus on what the DAO needs. Complex rewards lead to “hacks” (e.g. like tip farming)\n   1. Example: Create guidance via “Reward Personas'' and “Work Categories”. These can be used as a reference and tweaked based on specific context.\n4. **We will calibrate rewards to a target monthly and yearly take-home:** Make sure it meets expectations (i.e. higher than minimum wage, covers your cost of living).\n\n## STEP 2 - Reward Eligibility: Who should we reward?\n\nPrior to determining what reward to give and how to distribute it, it's often good to ask: ***Who should we reward?*** At Cabin we will call this Eligibility.\n\n> *💡 Quick Note: In a traditional business setting, a full-time employee performs full-time work. Full-time work is Eligible for compensation, which could be an hourly wage, monthly salary and a certain variable payment (e.g. bonus).*\n\nReward eligibility is based on **(1) the work itself** and **(2) the individual** (via role or contribution level)**.** Here's a simple way to determine whether or not a piece of work should be rewarded in the first place.\n\nOur initial Cabin guidance is below. We recommend each DAO review and create a custom map based on their mission, treasury plan, and community needs.\n\n![Sample Work Eligibility Worksheet](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vhPZXGA6g7WJ3xUCfuZnw.png?height=1658&width=1440)\n\nAs the worksheet suggests, Cabin is currently rewarding creation, but not ideation. **We want to incentivize completion.** In the future, if we run out of ideas, we might revisit and reassign rewards to incentivize proposals.\n\nIn some cases, community members may not have structured work assignments but should be rewarded based on continued participation:\n\n![Sample Member Eligibility Worksheet](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jJRFM25nkPBqUHJtHRXIn.png?height=752&width=1440)\n\nIt can be a useful exercise to create mnemonic devices to communicate these more complex frameworks. Mnemonic devices include memes, sayings, or other word-play like an acrostic. At Cabin we don’t have one yet, but it will likely pop-up soon enough.\n\n> *💡 Quick Note: These are examples of eligibility and are not mutually exclusive or collectively exhaustive. Many new creative eligibility criteria can be considered, especially related to inter-related characteristics. For example, we are certain that special eligibility will include future reputation protocols, transaction history, mutual referrals, and staking status.*\n\n## STEP 3 - Reward Structure: What should we reward, under what terms?\n\nOnce you’ve decided on which work types and member groups are rewarded, the next step is to create a map of **reward types and terms**. Here’s what Cabin might use over the next few seasons (still TBD):\n\n![Reward Types Sample Worksheet](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iSoeFhQZBr67-FJ4OTOWt.png?height=1592&width=1440)\n\n![Reward Terms Sample Worksheet](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ULIWncVcTRGQ08iBUZr2a.png?height=1507&width=1440)\n\n**Any community member should be able to review the reward mechanisms and request the ones that best fit** their risk profile, short-term and long-term preferences, and the work they are completing.\n\nA DAO can create Reward Personas to show community members examples of how their work will be rewarded.\n\n```\nReward Persona Example:\n\n* Contributor: New Member, Writer, Bounty-Hunter\n\n* Work: Completing an deep-dive research write-up for DAO\n\n* Reward Eligibility: Yes (eligible based on project)\n\n* Reward Type: Pay 50-50 CABIN-USDC (Asset) per project (Allocation) from Treasury (Source).\n\n* Reward Terms: Paid immediately (Timing), scaled based on complexity (Multiplier), once upon completion (Disbursement).\n```\n\n[https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1443269178404786186?s=20 ](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1443269178404786186?s=20)\n\n## STEP 4 - Reward Amount: How much should we reward?\n\nIt’s typically easier to determine eligibility and reward type / terms before determining the size of the reward.\n\nIn the previous example, the writer agreed:\n\n* (Eligibility) that they should be paid\n* (Type) what the reward should include\n* (Terms) how they should be given the reward\n\nThe final decision (and usually hardest!) is to agree on the amount.\n\nReward amounts are currently calculated either by individual decision, algorithm, or a combination of both.\n\nWe won’t be covering algorithmic allocations in this article - as there are other experts, and we’re probably best to leave that to them (e.g. like Coordinape).\n\nFor individually calculated rewards, consider market pay rates (if any available), total effort worked, and adjustment values based on volatility and upside. Here’s an example of reward formula design:\n\n### Scenario 1: Formula for Base Payouts, Bounties, or Projects\n\n```\nReward Amount = \n(Market Price USDC * digital asset conversion rate * Multiplier * Volatility Risk Adjustment) / Upside Opportunity\n```\n\nVariable Definitions:\n\n* **Market Price:** Wages for comparable web2 job (e.g. using glassdoor, or other benchmark like web2 salary midpoint)\n* **Conversion Rate:** USD to Token price conversion, could be defined as spot price on day of payment or 30-day average.\n* **Multiplier:** Increased payout based on internal demand, work complexity, effort level (could be between a 1-3x adjustment)\n* **Volatility Risk:** Increased payout based on liquidity availability, DAO maturity, market sentiment, recent digital asset volatility (e.g. usually a 1-3x adjustment)\n* **Upside Opportunity:** Decreased payout based on expected growth. Note this should be carefully considered since forecasting increased valuations is likely inaccurate.\n\nAt Cabin we pay more than standard market rates where possible because we’re in a high risk environment. If your token payouts have high volatility, the pay should be much higher than a FAANG basic salary.\n\n> 💡 *For more information about designing custom formulas and indexes, you can read about how these are used in Materials Engineering and Design [here](http://mech.vub.ac.be/teaching/info/Ontwerpmethodologie/Appendix%20les%203%20Materiaal%20Indices.pdf).*\n\n### Scenario 2: KPI-Driven Payouts\n\nIn more advanced cases, payouts are tied to work outcomes, likerevenue sharing agreements on a specific product development process, for example.  Most often, KPI targets through commission or defined as a curve, trigger a reward. Here are some examples:\n\n* **Set Targets:** If average time on the website increases from 30 sec to 45 sec, then provide payment of X tokens.\n* **Commission**: At Cabin we sell weekly passports for IRL gatherings of guilds and DAOs. If a member successfully sells one of the passports, they receive 10% of the value.\n* **Payout Curves:** Inspired by the pay ranges of traditional sales teams, a DAO could pay out X tokens at 100% of goal but a 200% payout at 150% of goal. You can read more about these types of models [here](https://aurochssolutions.com/blog/different-types-of-sales-incentive-payout-curves-explained/).\n\n## STEP 5 - Reward Consensus: How do we agree on the reward?\n\nA selected team of community leads, mediators, or stewards or a larger community vote can help a final rewards proposal reach consensus.\n\nEither way, the DAO has to put safeguards to protect the treasury.  For example, a community can cap treasury disbursement based on available funds, or allocate some of the treasury to use for rewards during the upcoming season.\n\n1. **Selected Team Consensus:** A few selected people are given permission to approve rewards. For example, a specified community member, identified as the Guild Lead, tells the team that the proposed reward is either in line with the plan or not.\n2. **Community Consensus:** Community members vote via Tally or Snapshot to approve the reward proposal. This is typically used when agreeing on (1) recurring payments to part-time or full-time contributors, or (2) retroactively awarding contributions (e.g. via Coordinape).\n\n## Reward Bias Awareness\n\nIn designing new reward systems, we should keep expected biases in mind. DAOs should work together, create a new metadata framework, and build a public database of payments. Over time, anyone can look at this to help inform their pay requests, identify new types of bias, confirm offers, and serve as a reference for other DAOs.\n\n[https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1439261664306683920?s=21](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1439261664306683920?s=21)\n\nOver the past few months there have been three types of digital bias emerging:\n\n1. **Network** (Geography, Gender, etc.)\n2. **Inheritance** (OG, Founder preference)\n3. **Assets** (PFP, Digital Inventory)\n\nThese biases sow discord (pun intended!) within a community and create unhealthy power dynamics.\n\nFor example, if a new member with a premium PFP joins a community and gets a higher payment for similar work and similar value, other contributors will claim back-payments, develop resentment towards the individual, and potentially actively block the work.\n\nThis said, we need to  differentiate between rewards bias and reward tinkering based on new needs. ***By creating a public database and an extensive (but automated!) meta-data framework, we uncover these trends and take steps to prevent bias. In the meantime, each community will have to invest in local bias awareness.***\n\n## Better Rewards, Better Collaboration\n\nRewards are a foundational aspect to any community and will be a topic to revisit, debate, and experiment with openly. We look forward to seeing how DAOs evolve and what new products emerge. After all, clear and competitive reward expectations will be one of the pieces that will accelerate the mass migration of workers from web2 to web3.\n\n[https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1451113107489689603?s=20](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1451113107489689603?s=20)\n\n## APPENDIX: Reward Design References\n\n### Reward Benchmarks\n\n* Glassdoor: <https://www.glassdoor.com/member/home/index.htm>\n* salary.com: <https://www.salary.com>\n* LinkedIn: <https://www.linkedin.com/salary/>\n* Example Bounty Boards:\n  * [PieDAO](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i7GWvcn0wBJXbz9ZRsM91NiMeVWb8nAgtocuP2V6LMo/edit#gid=1590879077)\n  * [Forefront](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pAgFGj9qcY-7SUI7dhyL5_4affPQXosz_5z8U7vl68k/edit#gid=196077105)\n  * [Bancor](https://alpha.layer3.xyz/daos/bancor)\n  * [SuperTeam](https://superteamdao.notion.site/ec017b7bfa7d4db0b688ec5195e931dd?v=0297dff31c0b40a5bb82ac25d0b716fe)\n  * [IndexCoop](https://alpha.layer3.xyz/daos/index-coop)\n\n### Reward Tools\n\n* Subjective Contribution Allocations: <https://coordinape.com/>\n* Objective Activity Analysis: <https://sourcecred.io/>\n* Invoicing: [https://gilded.finance/](https://gilded.finance/stablecoin-payments)\n* Recurring Payments: <https://parcel.money/>\n* Stream Money: <https://pay.sablier.finance/>\n* Tipping and Gates: [collab.land](http://collab.land)\n* Payment Management: [request.finance](https://www.request.finance/)\n* Payment Automation: <https://www.utopialabs.com/>\n* Programmable Cashflows: <http://superfluid.finance>\n* Token Creation, Vesting, Airdrops: <https://www.coinvise.co/>\n* Contributor Weighting: <https://www.govrn.io/>\n* Contributor Benefits (401k, insurance): <http://www.opolis.co/>\n* Payment distribution: <https://disperse.app/>\n\n### Reward Tweets and Articles\n\n* [The 90-9-1 Rule for Participation Inequality in Social Media and Online Communities](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/participation-inequality/)\n* [FWB Organization Design Example](https://zhang.mirror.xyz/dR4oK4JzxD-48w2M8JyOlHzqSyzU8CnUnPhdMvhIyxs)\n* [The Gig Economy and Worker Protections, via Quartz](https://qz.com/1556194/the-gig-economy-is-quietly-undermining-a-century-of-worker-protections/)\n\n[https://twitter.com/albiverse/status/1443594777627402243?s=21](https://twitter.com/albiverse/status/1443594777627402243?s=21)\n\n### Reward Forum Discussions and Proposals\n\n* SeedClub: <https://forum.seedclub.io/d/3-scp02-compensation-framework-for-contributors/5>\n* DAOHaus: <https://forum.daohaus.club/t/discussion-contributor-compensation-revamp-proposal/1958>\n* Forefront: <https://forum.forefront.news/d/35-ftpt-contributors-onboarding-proposal/5>\n* 1Hive: <https://forum.1hive.org/t/1hive-gardens-retroactive-funding/4469>\n* Cabin: <https://snapshot.org/#/cabindao.eth/proposal/QmRw1z13s2ULL9vmK5iDt1kdygvcGkKF3s7Yke8SaKbj5s>\n\n### Upcoming Reward Research\n\n**Governauts Reward:** <https://forum.gnosis.io/t/governauts-rewards-systems-research-initiative/1790>", "timestamp": 1635147219, "digest": "Le68ptgaqsBh1g6w8UqqVL2kIrA_Lqn37bELMO-W_-0", "contributor": "0xe62d071Ea99A63798Fec7222c483c53e87F2A32E"}

We’ve aggregated everything we know about reward design from discussions with multiple DAOs, and combined that with information about compensation in traditional businesses.*\n\n*As a DAO contributor, you can use this guide to help understand what options you have. As a DAO community engineer, you can use this document to design general guidance for your community. **There’s also benchmarks in the Appendix.***\n\n*This article is for regular contributors and community engineers / builders. If you are just starting your DAO journey, [take a peek over here instead!](https://creators.mirror.xyz/862A5rBtKX3BC8eEircDnGwPIJJTJ33hn-MvnukByPc)*\n\n\n---\n\n## It’s all incentives? Always has been.\n\n> *Bobby logged into the server. Today the contributors had an important discussion pending: bounties and contributor rewards. As part of the conversation, Bobby had to help reach consensus on benchmark bounty rewards and a proposal for ongoing payments for regular contributors (incl. part-time and full-time). However, Bobby wasn't sure how to go about this - What were other communities doing? What incentives should they use to support their overall mission? Should the community allocate tokens or USDC?*\n\n[https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1448615205877989379?s=20](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1448615205877989379?s=20)\n\nThere’s a Bobby in every DAO, striving to help make contributor rewards ***transparent***, ***decentralized***, ***fair***, and ***sustainable***. After all, incentives run the world and can make or break an organization.\n\nThat being said, these are very early days. A variety of new rewards will likely emerge over the next few years - just like NFT status symbols were popularized last summer. **This reward recipe book should be considered intermediary guidance** while we discover new rewards inspired by game design, and incorporating novel ownership mechanisms.\n\n> *💡 Quick Note: We will exclude token appreciation, community-wide disbursements (e.g. airdrops) and reputation in this article. We will likely take a look at these topics in other articles related to community engagement design.*\n\n## Recipes not Instructions\n\nIt can be tempting as a community genesis member or guild veteran to try and define a clear set of instructions. Creating static company-wide policies is how most of us have done it in traditional organizations. It’s like a warm weighted blanket - a feeling of comfort in certainty.\n\n[https://twitter.com/MichaelaOkla/status/1110261724223930368?s=20](https://twitter.com/MichaelaOkla/status/1110261724223930368?s=20)\n\nHowever, we’re in a different ecosystem with **ambiguity, volatility, constant change, and an opportunity for artistic experimentation**. As a result of this dynamic space, it’s probably best to think about community guidance as contextual (artistic!) recipes while encouraging individual members and guilds to find the right solutions for their context.\n\n[https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1447592927748837384?s=20](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1447592927748837384?s=20)\n\n## What is a “Reward” anyways?\n\nRewards can mean a variety of different things.\n\nAt Cabin, when we use the term Reward, we mean \"pay for eligible work\". When we mention “pay”, we mean rewards in the form of liquid ownership. In other words, rewards should:\n\n1. **Liquid**: Be useful for rent and food\n2. **Ownership**: Distribute governance power of the community\n\nThe latter is critical, as without it we run the risk of developing negative aspects of the [gig economy.](https://qz.com/1556194/the-gig-economy-is-quietly-undermining-a-century-of-worker-protections/)\n\nAt at a top level, we believe a good reward recipe book covers the following steps:\n\n1. Reward Principles: What’s the north star?\n2. Reward Eligibility: Who should we reward?\n3. Reward Structure: What should we reward, under what terms?\n4. Reward Amount: How much should we reward?\n5. Reward Consensus: How do we agree on the reward?\n\n![Five steps to explore reward options for yourself and your community](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BWA1xUO9sMhj1FexPz3L9.png?height=806&width=1440)\n\n## STEP 1 - Reward Principles: What’s the north star?\n\nThere are a lot of options in terms of who could get rewarded, what to reward, and how to distribute rewards. Spending some time thinking about decision-making guardrails can help narrow down the design space. In HR-speak, these are usually called “Design Principles” and “Design Practices”.\n\nHere’s an example from Warcamp (DAOHaus):\n\n![Source: Contributor Compensation Revamp Proposal, DAOhaus Core Contributors](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wlFILCY7FmDqV_G431d4D.PNG?height=470&width=1208)\n\n**Design Principles** should definitely vary across communities and over time. Over time, they reflect changes in membership, and most importantly, the evolution of the mission and focus. Some examples include:\n\n* Consistency, Flexibility, Collaboration, Alignment, Transparency, Simplicity, Ownership, Sustainability, Fairness, Decentralization, Predictability, Efficiency, Automation.\n\nOptimizing for one principle can mean decreasing focus on others. However, this doesn’t have to be the case given all the new technology we have at our disposal.\n\n[https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1451103939374592000?s=20](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1451103939374592000?s=20)\n\nIn addition to choosing basic principles, it’s useful to define **Design Practices**. This is the translation of principles into expected operational actions. Here are a few examples that help with the design process:\n\n1. **We will design rewards with inclusive collaboration as a core value:** This means testing rewards for accessibility, diversity, teamwork, and mutual generosity.\n2. **We will review rewards regularly:** For new DAOs this might be weekly or monthly. For more mature DAOs a Seasonal review probably is more appropriate.\n3. **We will keep it simple:** Making reward recommendations easily understandable by contributors helps them focus on what the DAO needs. Complex rewards lead to “hacks” (e.g. like tip farming)\n   1. Example: Create guidance via “Reward Personas'' and “Work Categories”. These can be used as a reference and tweaked based on specific context.\n4. **We will calibrate rewards to a target monthly and yearly take-home:** Make sure it meets expectations (i.e. higher than minimum wage, covers your cost of living).\n\n## STEP 2 - Reward Eligibility: Who should we reward?\n\nPrior to determining what reward to give and how to distribute it, it's often good to ask: ***Who should we reward?*** At Cabin we will call this Eligibility.\n\n> *💡 Quick Note: In a traditional business setting, a full-time employee performs full-time work. Full-time work is Eligible for compensation, which could be an hourly wage, monthly salary and a certain variable payment (e.g. bonus).*\n\nReward eligibility is based on **(1) the work itself** and **(2) the individual** (via role or contribution level)**.** Here's a simple way to determine whether or not a piece of work should be rewarded in the first place.\n\nOur initial Cabin guidance is below. We recommend each DAO review and create a custom map based on their mission, treasury plan, and community needs.\n\n![Sample Work Eligibility Worksheet](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vhPZXGA6g7WJ3xUCfuZnw.png?height=1658&width=1440)\n\nAs the worksheet suggests, Cabin is currently rewarding creation, but not ideation. **We want to incentivize completion.** In the future, if we run out of ideas, we might revisit and reassign rewards to incentivize proposals.\n\nIn some cases, community members may not have structured work assignments but should be rewarded based on continued participation:\n\n![Sample Member Eligibility Worksheet](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jJRFM25nkPBqUHJtHRXIn.png?height=752&width=1440)\n\nIt can be a useful exercise to create mnemonic devices to communicate these more complex frameworks. Mnemonic devices include memes, sayings, or other word-play like an acrostic. At Cabin we don’t have one yet, but it will likely pop-up soon enough.\n\n> *💡 Quick Note: These are examples of eligibility and are not mutually exclusive or collectively exhaustive. Many new creative eligibility criteria can be considered, especially related to inter-related characteristics. For example, we are certain that special eligibility will include future reputation protocols, transaction history, mutual referrals, and staking status.*\n\n## STEP 3 - Reward Structure: What should we reward, under what terms?\n\nOnce you’ve decided on which work types and member groups are rewarded, the next step is to create a map of **reward types and terms**. Here’s what Cabin might use over the next few seasons (still TBD):\n\n![Reward Types Sample Worksheet](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iSoeFhQZBr67-FJ4OTOWt.png?height=1592&width=1440)\n\n![Reward Terms Sample Worksheet](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ULIWncVcTRGQ08iBUZr2a.png?height=1507&width=1440)\n\n**Any community member should be able to review the reward mechanisms and request the ones that best fit** their risk profile, short-term and long-term preferences, and the work they are completing.\n\nA DAO can create Reward Personas to show community members examples of how their work will be rewarded.\n\n```\nReward Persona Example:\n\n* Contributor: New Member, Writer, Bounty-Hunter\n\n* Work: Completing an deep-dive research write-up for DAO\n\n* Reward Eligibility: Yes (eligible based on project)\n\n* Reward Type: Pay 50-50 CABIN-USDC (Asset) per project (Allocation) from Treasury (Source).\n\n* Reward Terms: Paid immediately (Timing), scaled based on complexity (Multiplier), once upon completion (Disbursement).\n```\n\n[https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1443269178404786186?s=20 ](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1443269178404786186?s=20)\n\n## STEP 4 - Reward Amount: How much should we reward?\n\nIt’s typically easier to determine eligibility and reward type / terms before determining the size of the reward.\n\nIn the previous example, the writer agreed:\n\n* (Eligibility) that they should be paid\n* (Type) what the reward should include\n* (Terms) how they should be given the reward\n\nThe final decision (and usually hardest!) is to agree on the amount.\n\nReward amounts are currently calculated either by individual decision, algorithm, or a combination of both.\n\nWe won’t be covering algorithmic allocations in this article - as there are other experts, and we’re probably best to leave that to them (e.g. like Coordinape).\n\nFor individually calculated rewards, consider market pay rates (if any available), total effort worked, and adjustment values based on volatility and upside. Here’s an example of reward formula design:\n\n### Scenario 1: Formula for Base Payouts, Bounties, or Projects\n\n```\nReward Amount = \n(Market Price USDC * digital asset conversion rate * Multiplier * Volatility Risk Adjustment) / Upside Opportunity\n```\n\nVariable Definitions:\n\n* **Market Price:** Wages for comparable web2 job (e.g. using glassdoor, or other benchmark like web2 salary midpoint)\n* **Conversion Rate:** USD to Token price conversion, could be defined as spot price on day of payment or 30-day average.\n* **Multiplier:** Increased payout based on internal demand, work complexity, effort level (could be between a 1-3x adjustment)\n* **Volatility Risk:** Increased payout based on liquidity availability, DAO maturity, market sentiment, recent digital asset volatility (e.g. usually a 1-3x adjustment)\n* **Upside Opportunity:** Decreased payout based on expected growth. Note this should be carefully considered since forecasting increased valuations is likely inaccurate.\n\nAt Cabin we pay more than standard market rates where possible because we’re in a high risk environment. If your token payouts have high volatility, the pay should be much higher than a FAANG basic salary.\n\n> 💡 *For more information about designing custom formulas and indexes, you can read about how these are used in Materials Engineering and Design [here](http://mech.vub.ac.be/teaching/info/Ontwerpmethodologie/Appendix%20les%203%20Materiaal%20Indices.pdf).*\n\n### Scenario 2: KPI-Driven Payouts\n\nIn more advanced cases, payouts are tied to work outcomes, likerevenue sharing agreements on a specific product development process, for example.  Most often, KPI targets through commission or defined as a curve, trigger a reward. Here are some examples:\n\n* **Set Targets:** If average time on the website increases from 30 sec to 45 sec, then provide payment of X tokens.\n* **Commission**: At Cabin we sell weekly passports for IRL gatherings of guilds and DAOs. If a member successfully sells one of the passports, they receive 10% of the value.\n* **Payout Curves:** Inspired by the pay ranges of traditional sales teams, a DAO could pay out X tokens at 100% of goal but a 200% payout at 150% of goal. You can read more about these types of models [here](https://aurochssolutions.com/blog/different-types-of-sales-incentive-payout-curves-explained/).\n\n## STEP 5 - Reward Consensus: How do we agree on the reward?\n\nA selected team of community leads, mediators, or stewards or a larger community vote can help a final rewards proposal reach consensus.\n\nEither way, the DAO has to put safeguards to protect the treasury.  For example, a community can cap treasury disbursement based on available funds, or allocate some of the treasury to use for rewards during the upcoming season.\n\n1. **Selected Team Consensus:** A few selected people are given permission to approve rewards. For example, a specified community member, identified as the Guild Lead, tells the team that the proposed reward is either in line with the plan or not.\n2. **Community Consensus:** Community members vote via Tally or Snapshot to approve the reward proposal. This is typically used when agreeing on (1) recurring payments to part-time or full-time contributors, or (2) retroactively awarding contributions (e.g. via Coordinape).\n\n## Reward Bias Awareness\n\nIn designing new reward systems, we should keep expected biases in mind. DAOs should work together, create a new metadata framework, and build a public database of payments. Over time, anyone can look at this to help inform their pay requests, identify new types of bias, confirm offers, and serve as a reference for other DAOs.\n\n[https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1439261664306683920?s=21](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1439261664306683920?s=21)\n\nOver the past few months there have been three types of digital bias emerging:\n\n1. **Network** (Geography, Gender, etc.)\n2. **Inheritance** (OG, Founder preference)\n3. **Assets** (PFP, Digital Inventory)\n\nThese biases sow discord (pun intended!) within a community and create unhealthy power dynamics.\n\nFor example, if a new member with a premium PFP joins a community and gets a higher payment for similar work and similar value, other contributors will claim back-payments, develop resentment towards the individual, and potentially actively block the work.\n\nThis said, we need to  differentiate between rewards bias and reward tinkering based on new needs. ***By creating a public database and an extensive (but automated!) meta-data framework, we uncover these trends and take steps to prevent bias.

Yung，Summer Zhao 对本文的校对\n\n## DAO 的前世今生\n\n2016 年 4 月 30 日，区块链公司 [Slock.it](http://Slock.it) 发起了第一个 DAO 项目---The DAO，这是一个早期的去中心化自治组织（DAO）和风险投资基金。当时 11000 人投资了 1150 万个 ETH，占以太坊总供应量 14%，价值约为 1.5 亿美元。这也让 The DAO 成为了当时最大的众筹项目，FOMO 程度超出了很多人的想象，包括项目方自己。\n\n「The DAO 是经济组织理念的一个范式转变。它提供了完全的透明度，完全的股东控制权，前所未有的灵活性和自主治理」。\n\n然而，乐极生悲。「暂停交易，我们遭到了攻击。」2016 年 6 月 17 日，黑客利用 The DAO「递归调用」和「调用转移避免销毁」两个漏洞，进行了两百多次攻击，总共盗走了 360 万的以太坊，超过了该项目筹集的以太坊总数目的三分之一。\n\n然而黑客并无法直接变现，按照当时智能合约条款，这些资金会被搁置 28 天，这给了 The DAO 和以太坊社区近一个月的时间来考虑如何处理。后面，大家都知道了，以太坊社区进行了硬分叉，分成了 ETC 和 ETH，借此挽救这次的损失。以太坊核心团队不能强迫社区转移，但人们用脚投票，回答了这个问题：消除黑客的好处是否超过了人为干预对以太坊信任的代价？对大多数人来说，确实如此。\n\n如果不是因为分叉，黑客在 2016 年 6 月 17 日从 The DAO 窃取的以太币（ETH）今天将价值 66 亿美元。\n\n五年后的今天，对 DAO 的讨论再现江湖，DAO 也已经拥有一系列使用案例。我可以看到我身边关注的一些非常聪明的小伙伴已经在开始讨论 DAO，现在的 DAO 原生状态，有点 2020 年年初 NFT 的味道。\n\n我们早期布局 NFT 时，曾认为它是「区块链离现实落地最近的入口」，事实也证明它的确非常容易带来一些极大的关注度：短短三天时间，Meebits 在二级市场的总交易额便已高达 1.2 万 ETH，约合 4200 万美元，Uniswap 一双袜子卖 16 万美元，Jack Dorsey 一条推特五个单词拍出 250 万美元，Nynt Cat 第一个作品拍出 65.6 万美金，Beeple 在佳士得的 NFT 作品拍出 6935 万美金天价……\n\n但今天的 DAO 仿佛就晦涩难懂的多，那么到底什么是 DAO 呢？\n\n## 什么是 DAO？\n\nKevin Kelly 在《失控》里描述了蜂群的行为：当一群蜜蜂要搬家时，蜂王并不是直接做决定，而是一群蜜蜂前去侦察，回来之后，侦察蜂就对着蜂群跳舞表示结果。跳的舞越夸张，就说明越好。蜂群看到之后，就会又让另一些蜜蜂跟着去查看。如果也觉得好，也会回来一起跳舞。「通过这种反复强调，大家喜欢的地点就会吸引更多探访者，由此又会有更多的探访者加入进来。」\n\n最后最大的蜂群获胜，蜂王也随之迁居。在这个过程中，蜂王什么都没有做，只是跟着最大的蜂群而去，没有蜜蜂做出「最终决定」，但所有蜜蜂几乎都参与了决定。\n\n这就是蜂群思维，「『蜂群思维』的神奇在于，没有一只蜜蜂在控制它，但是有一只看不见的手，一只从大量愚钝的成员中涌现出来的手，控制着整个群体。」\n\n这就是原生的 DAO。\n\n考察 DAO 的定义，DAO（Decentralized Autonomous Organization）是一个去中心化的自治组织，它是围绕一个任务组织起来的团体，通过一套在区块链上执行的共享规则进行协调自治。\n\nDAO 将决策权交给利益相关者，而不是高管或董事会成员来实现 \"去中心化 \"；\"自治 \"则在于通过智能合约，使用户在可公开访问的区块链上运行的应用程序，若满足某些条件，就会自动触发相关行动和结果。\n\n这是「组织形态」上的变革和更新。\n\n我很喜欢 Jesse Walden 之前对 Defi 和 NFT 的一个总结：\n\nDefi: Money Legos\n\nNFT: Media Legos\n\n我认为 DAO 可能是 NFT 的上层，DAO 可以拥有 NFT 和创造 NFT，还能容纳很多非 NFT 的事。如果说 NFT 是「Media legos」，那 DAO 很可能是「Corporate legos」，这点和 Santi 的观点是不谋而合。\n\n\"就像今天的创作者粉丝群体一样，每个'公司'或项目将变得更像一个部落，由将其成员联系在一起的故事和符号来驱动和定义，而由那些最能编织其叙事的人领导。\"\n\n虽然，DAO 是「权力下放」的过程，但绝不能没有「权力中心」，那些抨击一个项目或者组织最终还是被某一小撮人控制的诟病，并不是 DAO 的缺陷。任何组织想要将决定和任务有条不紊进行下去，就一定有人决策，无论是前期还是后期，无论是有形还是无形，无论是群体还是个人。而 DAO 要解决的是权力的「分散性」和「流动性」，前者赋能项目参与者对项目的话语权，后者保证起决定性因素的领导者的不断更迭。\n\n在上一篇文章《后 NFT 时代》中，我提到了 Social Money 效应，如果说 Social Money 宣扬的更多是个人影响力的「Monertization」的过程，那 DAO 则是关于我们可以共同完成多少事情的宏伟命题。\n\n## DAO 的组织形态\n\n截至 5 月初，DAO 生态系统管理的总资产（根据 DeepDAO 数据）已经超越 10 亿美金，而且这一数据并没有把那些不以 DAO 形式运营或使用独立 DAO 架构的加密协议计算在内。「DAO 生态系统管理的总资产」和市场经济下「公司制管理的资产规模」意思类似，只是市场经济下的绝大多数资产都是由公司管理的，因此我们并不方便直接对比规模，但作为一种新型组织治理模式，「10 亿美元」这个规模足以成为 DAO 本身生态系统发展的一个标志。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/urH6qVCH4gz6fKNdM8XIh.png?height=392&width=660)\n\nDAO 管理资产总量排行\n\nPolychain Capital 首席执行官兼创始人 Olaf Carlson-Wee 早前表示：「DAO 是风险资本未来，DAO 即将成为仅次于数字现金的区块链领域第二个重大突破。」\n\n当然这里的 DAO 划分可能过于「狭义」，并非所有 DAO 生态都是跟「管理资产」相关，DAO 的组织形态也有「基础设施」，「资管类别 DAO」，「治理 DAO」，「聚合器」，「Yield DAO」，「Guild」，「Creator&Media DAO」，「DAO Adaptor」八个类别分别阐述。\n\n基础设施层面，DAO 已逐渐成为 Web3 基础结构的重要组成部分，像 Aragon，DAOstack，Moloch 等各种 DAO 协议的不断发展，为想要发起，治理，管理 DAO 的组织提供了巨大便利。比如，Aragon 提供了一站式的工具和服务，将社区、事业等变成一个经济体，释放出一个长尾 DAO 组织形态。相比于 Aragon 的复杂，Moloch 是以「残酷的极简主义」的设计理念建造的，目的是创建一个「最小可行的 DAO」，可以让人们为一个共同的目标，分配共享资源的同时积极地将不良因素的攻击降低至最小化。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j3dOll8CgKuVEGlRtnq7r.png?height=280&width=660)\n\n资管类别层面，正占据着目前 DAO 市场极大份额，即 Venture DAO，这里指的是「以投资为导向」的 DAO 组织，比如 Metacartel，The LAO 等，但也有以发放「Grant」的投资组织比如 Moloch，Marketing DAO 等。\n\nVenture DAO 与传统基金不同的是，机构和高净值个人（有限合伙人或 LPs）将资金投入基金，其他人（普通合伙人或 GPs）将资金投入公司，DAO 的投资者将能够根据智能合约中预先设定的规则对提案进行投票。每个人的投票都由他们持有的代币数量加权，而代币数量是基于他们的投资额。如果一个提议的项目获得了足够的票数，智能合约会自动触发 The DAO 的资金投资到项目的 ETH 钱包，当然这是理想化的 Venture DAO 形态，很多的 DAO 依旧还处于「渐进式去中心化」状态（详见下一章节）。\n\n值得一提的是，目前 Venture DAO 在 NFT 赛道当中亮眼表现，如下图罗列的 WHALE，FlamingoDAO，PleasrDAO，Jenny Metaverse DAO 等都是专注于投资 NFT 资产的 DAO 组织。4 月 19 日，PleasrDAO 以 2224 枚 ETH 打败竞争对手，成功拍得斯诺登首个 NFT 作品「Stay Free」，Jenny Metaverse DAO 也于近期成功完成 700 万美金的募资，而 WHALE 创始人 WhaleShark 也反复表示对于 WHALE 从一而终的理念是「WhaleShark out, DAO up!」，这一切似乎也在逐步验证 Matt Huang 的那句话「The next Berkshire Hathaway will begin as a DAO.」\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ifljOK7nsMVhdfUfBdSp1.png?height=427&width=660)\n\n治理（Governance）类型 DAO，是除了投资类型 DAO 之外，极其重要的一个组成部分，正如前文提到的，DAO 是组织「权力下放」的过程，用户通过持有资产的比例决定了投票权重，投票权重又直接影响了决策的方向（关于 DAO 的决策将会在下下一章节《靠谱度加权和极致透明畅想》展开探讨），而这一决策则是由诸如 Snapshot，Tally，Gnosis SAFE 等治理工具实现的。当然，一个项目可能有多种属性和标签，比如 Aragon 除了基础设施之外也是治理工具。「聚合器」类别的 DAO 也往往带有投票治理的功能。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DV3SWN76MIkFyfAlwWZM0.png?height=320&width=660)\n\n至于后面的几种组织形态，Yield DAO，是汇集资产后协同赚取 DeFi 收益的类别，Barn DAO，PieDAO，BadgerDAO 等在 DAO 资产沉淀类别当中也一直处于前列。\n\nGuild DAO 则像是一种公会治理，比如 Yield Guild Games（YGG），它是一个游戏公会，各地玩家可以通过公会聚集在一起通过各类游戏的边玩边赚机制赚取游戏收益。传统区块链游戏中，尤其是 NFT 游戏，往往需要用户先持有 NFT 资产才可以进入游戏，而类似 YGG 这样的公会机构可以帮用户免去购买资产的过程，将资产的所有权和使用权分离达到各方共赢的状态。Raid Guild 和 Rabbithole 则类似于「任务众包」的组织，前者是通过聚集区块链专业人士提供「咨询」，「公关」，「设计」，「开发」等服务，后者则是面向 C 端，用户可通过玩 dapp 等任务而赚取收益。Metafactory 则是属于业务型的 DAO, 专注于数字&实体时尚品牌的孵化平台。\n\nCreator DAO 和 Media DAO 是近期新生的 DAO 组织，自千禧一代成为社会主力之后，Passion Economy 和 Creator Economy 逐渐兴起。从资本的角度来看，也有种从 VC 到 Community Capital 再到 Solo Capital 的趋势，这些其实都是「个人影响力」发酵的结果。而像 Mirrior 这样的新生创作者社区将模块最小化，但将个人影响力最大化，从个人影响力辐射到 NFT（商品），或到 Crowdfund（募资），我认为这也是非常前卫的探索。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UE9y-p3Y1dAyy2tE9TlDE.png?height=446&width=660)\n\n总结来看，本质上，任何具有 DAO 治理和管理的自治组织都可以称为 DAO，所以 DAO 更像是一个「可组合模块」渗透到各类项目当中去，这类生态组成在此定义为「DAO Adaptor」，其中大家熟悉的项目包括 Uniswap，MakerDAO，AAVE，Compound，YFI，Aavegotchi，Decentraland 等都是 DAO 组织的先行者。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8BtOpvPeX6h7kERjZy1u4.png?height=330&width=660)\n\nDAO 不是自上而下的等级结构，而是使用 Web3 技术和快速发展的治理和激励系统，来分配决策权和财务奖励。上述各种组织形态可能过于复杂，个人觉得简单来说，除了基础设施类别之外，DAO 其实是一种为项目融资（Venture DAO）、治理社区（Governence DAO）和分享价值（Creator DAO）的新型组合方式。\n\n## 渐进式去中心化\n\n在笔者研究 NFT，DAO，Social Token，Passion Economy，Creator Economy 的时候，常常会围观 NotBoring Packy McCormick 和 Variant Fund Jesse Walden 的观点。我第一次读到 Packy 文章时，我和我闺蜜的原话是「Shit, he is literally reading my mind…...」, 豪不夸张得讲，他是我想藏起来独享的宝藏博主，而 Jesse 的文章则会是给到我更多发散性的启发（两位都强烈推荐）。「渐进式去中心化」就是由 Jesse Walden 提出的概念，他认为：「加密货币公司不必，而且一般来说不应该从第一天起就成为一个 DAO，它们可以不断发展。」\n\n过于固守事物本来的形态，往往无法真正了解事物的本质，不管是包装还是归类的「定义」都是服务于「更好阐述产品本身」，而非用来限制「产品本身」。DAO 也是如此。\n\n从中心化过渡到去中心化，关键在于革新是否有助于产品本身，以及产品现有阶段是否适合这种革新？如果两者的答案都是 yes，才有推行下去的必要。创业途中，不断通过 demo 与用户测试交流，形成良好的反馈闭环，这样才能不断完善产品本身，好的产品需要试验和反馈，而绝不是创始人在家看完《失控》，预测未来 50 年的战略大局，然后纸上谈兵。好的产品，必须与其所处环境，紧密联系，共同进化。\n\n那该如何逐步完成一个去中心化的治理框架，从而\"建立一个可持续的、合规的和社区拥有的产品\"呢？\n\nWalden 给了我们三个步骤，我认为大家有必要一起来探讨一下：\n\n1. 产品与市场的契合\n\n加密货币初创公司的初期应该看起来像任何初创公司的初期：一个小而精的团队专注地将所有精力投入到构建，学习和迭代中，直到找到适合市场的产品。如果产品很烂，最终都是会脱离社区的。Web3 初创企业实际上在这里极具优势，通过将现有的智能合约，代码和产品整合到新的合约中来快速构建和测试，可以完成极快的试错过程。DeFi 之所以被称为「Money Legos」，是每当有人构建新的东西时，其即可直接成为可供他人使用的模块，魔术的诞生除了创造乐高之外，还有重构乐高的组合模式。\n\nAavegotchi 是我接触团队中最注重 DAO 化的团队之一，从提案，到投票，到 discord/twitter 等社交媒体的社交网图映射到项目的贡献权重值中，无一例外都在践行 DAO 化。但它也逃脱不了「渐进式 DAO」化的过程：前期的定调是由团队决定，而后期的重大决策则都是由社区决定。我深刻记得在第一次传送门发售之后，大家投票第二次传送门的发售在 Snapshot 被投票延迟之后，就连团队都惊讶于「在第一期稀有度挖矿之前，没有二期传送门」最终的结果，但是一个好产品的诞生难道不该是由「市场」来决定嘛？\n\n1. 社区参与\n\n一旦公司实现了产品与市场的契合，就应该开始尝试使更多的利益相关者更直接地参与其中。Walden 将其比作「开源开发」，邀请社区参与，提供赏金，赠款和其他激励措施，在开放的环境中发展，建立社区，并就决策达成初步共识。\n\n在这一点上，我最欣赏的国内团队是 Conflux，他们虽然还没有过渡到完全的去中心化，但其在「原始的任务众包」中已经做的非常体系化了。他们的 Bounty 计划，按照「技术」，「品牌「，」社群「，「资源」，「其他」几个维度向开放社区征集有识之士，每个任务都清晰罗列，相关人员可直接去认领，从而让更多的利益相关者能参与到生态构建上来。\n\nThe Sandbox 的体素创作者社区当中也是一个「原生的 DAO」，艺术家们每一段时间会根据相应主题形成几类分组，每个分组按照之前作品权重集成划分出相应小组长，小组长会指导成员并保证创作过程的稳步进行，一切都有规则，但权利又是「流动」的。\n\n上述例子其实和我们开篇 DAO 的分类中的 Guild 分类是一致，但是由于 DAO 的渐进式过程，项目都还是以「类原始」方式运行，而后阶段若过渡到完全 DAO 治理之后，可扩展性则会是指数型增长。\n\n1. 充分的权力下放\n\n完成前两个步骤后，接踵而至的是「完成 DAO 决策，并自动执行」。拆解之后我们要关注的，一是 Voting power，二是自动执行。Voting Power 目前大多是取决于持有的币数，但这一部分有很多人诟病核心团队或者大户可能会根据他们在社区中的地位或持有的代币数量来影响决策，针对于这点的问题和解决方案，我们将在下一章节详细探讨。自动执行则是通过触发智能合约预设的规则来铸造和分配代币，这些规则决定了从今天谁得到多少，将来代币将如何分配等。\n\n这样项目的未来发展就掌握在社区手中，这也是是众多项目目前最需要「渐进式去中心化」的关键原因，早前笔者问 WhaleShark 的时候，问及 WHALE 的 DAO 方案为何还是在 Discord 发起，而不是部署在任何 DAO 的基建上，他的回答是目前的 DAO 方案都还不够完善，很多 DAO 方案内容是复杂的，目前市面上没有一款产品能够让方案通过了就可以无需人工自动执行。而 Voting power 也存在上述提到的诸多问题。\n\n一个忠诚的社区加上有效的治理，会有效促进产品和市场达到一个完美契合度，而这也可能是完成 DAO 创新最行之有效的方式。\n\n## 靠谱度加权和极致透明畅想\n\n上一章节中遗留了一个问题：「目前大部分的 DAO 治理都是通过持有代币数量的多少来决定 Voting Power」，但这种就很容易陷入大户或者少部分人的集中性控制弊病。有人将「同票同权」的决策方式称之为「单细胞民主」，是伪民主，追求个体的绝对民主不一定是决策的最优解，那要如何保证民主和独权的平衡并保持策略的均纳什平衡呢？\n\n「我的目标是和我共事的人一起做有意义的工作，建立有意义的关系。我知道只有极度的透明和算法式的决策机制才能帮我实现这个目标。」---Ray Dalio\n\n靠谱度加权（believability-weighted）和极致透明（radical transparency）来源于桥水基金的决策模式，虽然 Dalio 不是 big fan of bitcion，但是桥水的公司决策模式却意外极具 DAO 化。\n\n在 DAO 决策中，我听到最多的反对意见就是，「一群人是没法做决策的」，除了代币代表的「stake」之外，还有什么「维度」可以用来加权吗？或者说人数多就代表绝对正确吗？大户/鲸鱼就代表绝对正确吗？答案显而易见是否定的，那是否可以按照「靠谱度加权」思路进行改善呢？\n\n靠谱度加权，简单来说就是你这个人如果靠谱，那么你说的意见分量就重一点；如果你这人不靠谱，那分量则会弱一些。这个道理看起来简单，但实施起来却不是易事，这也是为什么桥水的治理常被人称为「邪教文化」。\n\n「Dot Collector」是桥水来实现靠谱度加权的工具，员工可通过 strategic thinking（策略化思考）、dealing with ambiguity（对模糊化情况的处理能力）等不同维度给其他人打分，分数范围为 1 到 10 分，7 分为平均水平。\n\n所有的点评，比如打分人的 ID、分数、追加的附言评语都会被永久保存。每一个点评被称为一个 dot，某个人身上可能挂满了 dot，比如桥水的联席 CIO 身上就挂了约有 11000 多个点。各项维度最终集成为你的「靠谱度」（believability）。而在决策过程中，我们就可以通过靠谱度进行加权。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sPX50kxwcjCZwfkKvb-ub.png?height=372&width=660)\n\n（每个人按照靠谱度权重的颜色画像）\n\n「创意择优=极度求真+极度透明+可信度加权的决策。」\n\n回到我们的 DAO 治理当中来，我们以 Venture DAO 为例，最简单「靠谱度加权」方式就是追踪投资人的每次投资决策来形成他的「投资靠谱度」，从而在下一次的投资中会形成不同的权重（这部分若要衍生则要扩展到 DID 部分的探讨）。\n\n这就是桥水倡导的「创见上的贤人政治」（idea meritocracy），通过靠谱度加权（believability-weighted）的方式来达到追求「极端透明」（radical transparency），从而达成最佳决策。\n\n当然 DAO 的决策的成功不仅仅是「靠谱度加权」就足够了，Charlene Li 在《Open Leadership》一书中用：解释说明 (Explaining)，日常工作知会 (Updating)，自由对话 (Conversing)，公开发表意见 (Open Mic)，内部众包（Crowdsourcing)，统一信息平台 (Platform) 六个方面来阐述了企业内部开放沟通的行为特征和实现方式，笔者觉得也有借鉴意义（章节问题就不过多阐述了）。\n\n企业到 DAO 组织的过程，即是上述几个维度不断从封闭式专项开放式的过程。\n\n## NFT 的今天 DAO 的明天\n\n就像 NFT 一样，DAO 现在的早期实验可能只代表其未来潜力的一小部分。随着更多的 DAO 工具的出现，尝试创新变得越来越容易，而 DAO Legos 也不断在填充，不仅仅是应用层，在监管上 DAO 也有很大进展。\n\n今年 4 月，美国怀俄明州立法机构颁布了 Vermont Bill For blockchain 立法，通过了 DAOs 的合法性提案，它将允许 DAO 作为有限责任公司成立。对 DAO 来说，这可能是向前迈出的巨大一步，法案将允许 DAO 在链上操作、资产代理和管理其事务，这无疑也为 DAO 的可扩展性铺平了道路。\n\n在进入 DAO 这个 Rabbit Hole 之后，我一直期待看到这个领域还有什么有意思的创意以及上述的激励模型要如何反哺到项目本身。\n\n「The next big thing will start out looking like a toy」，我相信 NFT 的今天，将会是 DAO 的明天。", "timestamp": 1635149690, "digest": "M3-n3eb7T3KvRStmEcJYb2Hzy9ujVSPwayLk2EJtRh4", "contributor": "0xAE623c8B158C3dF75b4f0f3886cA36b49b72f3e9"}

Brian Flynn is cofounder of [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/). Patrick Rivera is an engineer at [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/).*\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/03/04/nfts-daos-and-the-new-creator-economy/](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/03/04/nfts-daos-and-the-new-creator-economy/)\n\nMedia companies are talent companies. As that becomes increasingly obvious to the media industry at large, there has been an acceleration of development by both challengers and incumbents to position themselves to capture media's most critical natural resource: people.\n\nThe creator economy served as a catalyst to disrupt legacy structures by introducing platforms and products that enable individuals to build a business around themselves. Top talent wants more control and ownership over their work, having options to transcend their reputation and financial success from a parent brand.\n\nIndependence is really hard. The creator economy has invited criticism of creator burnout, lack of necessary support and an absence of strategic and educational resources for individuals to better guide themselves in isolation. While there is accelerated development in the creator economy to fulfill those needs, there’s another economy being built that is positioned to extend the promise of the new media structure even further.\n\nThe ownership economy – by way of decentralized autonomous organizations (aka DAO) and non-fungible tokens (aka NFT) – builds a business on top of the creator economy that encourages creators, operators and the community to collaborate together under a new, interdependent ownership mechanism that combines the best of both (legacy and creator economy) worlds and then some.\n\nThis new media structure will be wholly owned by the creators, operators and consumers themselves.\n\nThis new media structure will be wholly owned by the creators, operators and consumers themselves. It will be a product of both the public and its producers and will not limit participants to a single company. These media companies can be looked at as collectives, with their own identities, where creators and consumers are encouraged to flow interdependently throughout various collectives. All of which results in everyone investing in both the development of each collective and sharing in the value of the collective’s upside.\n\n## TV, for example\n\nTo think of this pragmatically, let’s look at TV shows. Actors, actresses, producers and writers are free agents and sign deals for specific series on many platforms. Each series builds its own identity, reputation and community. The individuals who contribute to the show are free to work on other projects and may even be encouraged to in order to increase their own and the show's reputation (marketing!). This interoperability makes everything the individual touches more valuable.\n\nBack to creator-DAOs and NFTs. A DAO allows its creators, its support, its contributors and its audience to be owners in the collective. It means that every operation, and participants in the operation, are now shareholders. Today, creators can be owners in a media company by way of equity, but that’s often limited by the role each individual plays. As a result, once talented individuals build a strong enough reputation they're incentivized to negotiate contracts or go independent to retain more ownership over their work.\n\nMedia companies are starting to think about how they build a more welcome environment for those creators, but they’re developing in parallel to challenger structures like creator DAOs. DAOs present an alternative organizational structure that tries to align incentives for the long-term among a variety of stakeholders. The relationship changes from creator and consumer to everyone as co-creators. Creative organizations begin to look more like flat peer-to-peer networks as opposed to hierarchies.\n\nThis is possible because the media company (collective) itself is a crowdfund of its creators, supporters and community members. All participators invest in the entity, which results in a token, the “equity” of DAOs. All revenue across advertising, subscriptions, events and other means is then pooled to a treasury where all cash inflows and outflows are recorded publicly. There is a universal share in the ownership.\n\nWhere NFTs come in is that all digital assets created by the DAO are minted as NFTs. Through that, every asset becomes managed, monitored and owned. This means creators, operators and participants are all collaborators on the NFT asset. Outside of pure ownership and participation, this means an asset returns royalties based on the performance of the content, delivering returns for participants in perpetuity.\n\nAs media moved from print to digital, creative assets lost the ability to control and maintain value throughout the web ecosystem. With NFTs, digital media now becomes a liquid financial asset secured through cryptography, and programmable through smart contracts.\n\nNFT creators in the future will have two paths: independent or collective. As independent actors, creators can realize the full upside of their NFT creations and earn built-in royalties. But the collective model is an entirely new way to build distribution. Because the NFTs are programmable, the royalties can be broken down further into fractional shares.\n\nAnother benefit of NFTs is they turn digital media into public goods with pseudonymous ownership. A digital media file that’s minted as an NFT can be read by everyone, but owned as a collectible by a single entity. This provides a new monetization channel for digital media without limiting growth by putting content behind a paywall. It also revitalizes business models that used to be lucrative in the print era but lost in the digital era like the wire service.\n\nThere are parallel efforts throughout the media and tech ecosystem to try and get to the same place. How do we evolve the media’s infrastructure to draw benefit for the talent, the support and the community?\n\nTo capitalize on providing an infrastructure that benefits all parties, the foundation needs to be broken down and built back up again. It’s very hard to renovate a business, especially one that hasn’t been built on the criteria for the new era.\n\nThe creator economy started tearing down the foundation of legacy media’s structure to encourage both existing media companies and new entrants to think about building for and enabling talent-based companies. As both businesses begin to map out the next iteration of their technical and business architecture, there is infrastructure being mapped out that is ripe for all economies to be built on top of – the ownership economy.", "timestamp": 1635153816, "digest": "DVnSpYpixyu8Ss9tQhcJonRnCtaib2YK4sH8C72cLgo", "contributor": "0x4CC11987Ee4D62076F8218d0f97e81437611e311"}

A person who insisted on anonymity to discuss Manchin’s position told The Associated Press the senator is agreeable to the White House’s new approach on the tax proposals.\n\nWhat had been [a sweeping $3.5 trillion plan](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-politics-business-us-news-ap-top-news-a6e8ed2379857b7aa9c64f6d608bb938) is now being eyed as $1.75 trillion package. That’s within a range that could still climb considerably higher, according to a second person who insisted on anonymity to discuss the private talks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that even at “half” the original $3.5 trillion proposed, Biden’s signature domestic initiative would be larger than any other legislative package with big investments in health care, child care and strategies to tackle climate change.\n\n### JOE BIDEN\n\n#### AP source: Manchin agreeable to wealth tax for Biden plan\n\n#### Sluggish pace of confirmations vexes Biden White House\n\n#### Biden, Schumer, Manchin huddle, but still no budget deal\n\n#### ASEAN leaders hold summit with Myanmar’s general shut out\n\n“It is less than what was projected to begin with, but it’s still bigger than anything we have ever done in terms of addressing the needs of America’s working families,” Pelosi said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n\nDemocrats are working intensely to try again to wrap up talks on the measure so the president can spotlight his administration’s achievements to world leaders at two overseas summits on the economy and climate change that get underway this week.\n\nBiden met with Manchin and Schumer, D-N.Y., at the president’s home in Wilmington after Democrats missed last week’s deadline to resolve disputes. Biden has said he’d like to see a $2 trillion package and they are trying again this upcoming week to reach agreement.\n\nIt’s unclear what level of the new taxes Manchin would support, but he generally backs the White House proposals, according to the person who insisted on anonymity to discuss Manchin’s position. Neither person insisting on anonymity was authorized to discuss the negotiations by name.\n\nThe White House said the breakfast meeting was a “productive discussion” about the president’s agenda. The talks appeared to last for hours, but no decisions were announced. The Democrats “continued to make progress,” the White House said in its post-meeting statement.\n\nResolving the revenue side is key as the Democrats insist the new spending will be fully paid for by the various taxes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nManchin and another Democrat, [Sen. Kyrsten Sinema](https://apnews.com/hub/kyrsten-sinema) of Arizona, have almost on their own halted Biden’s proposal from advancing. With Republican opposition and an evenly split 50-50 Senate, Biden has no votes to spare, and the two Democratic senators have insisted on reducing the size of the enormous package and pressed for other changes.\n\nOne key debate has been over the revenues to pay for the package, after Sinema rejected an earlier plan to reverse the Republican-led 2017 tax cuts and raise rates on corporations earning more than $5 million a year and wealthy Americans earning more than $400,000, or $450,000 for couples.\n\nInstead, the White House is considering a tax on the investment incomes of billionaires — fewer than 1,000 of the wealthiest Americans with at least $1 billion in assets. It also has floated a 15% corporate minimum tax that is designed to ensure all companies pay what Biden calls their “fair share” — ending the practice of some big-name firms paying no taxes.\n\nDemocrats initially planned that Biden’s package would contain $3.5 trillion worth of spending and tax initiatives over 10 years. But demands by moderates led by Manchin and Sinema to contain costs mean its final price tag could well be less than $2 trillion.\n\nDisputes remain over far-reaching investments, including plans to expand Medicare coverage with dental, vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors; child care assistance; and free pre-kindergarten.\n\nPelosi, D-Calif., said on CNN that Democrats were still working to keep in provisions for four weeks of paid family leave but acknowledged that other proposals such as expanding Medicare to include dental coverage could prove harder to save because of cost.\n\nPelosi reiterated that about 90% is wrapped up and said she expected an agreement by week’s end, paving the way for a House vote on a separate $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill before next Sunday, Oct. 31, when a series of transportation programs will lapse. The Senate approved over the summer the package of road, broadband and other public works projects, but the measure stalled in the House during deliberations on the broader Biden bill.\n\nManchin, whose state has a major coal industry, has opposed Biden’s initial climate change proposals, which involved a plan to penalize utilities that do not switch quickly to clean energy. Democrats are now also compiling other climate change strategies to meet Biden’s goal of reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2030.\n\nDemocrats were hoping Biden could cite major accomplishments when he attends a global conference in Scotland on climate change in early November after attending a summit of world leaders in Rome.\n\nSen. Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, said the expected cuts to the clean energy provisions in the spending bill were especially disappointing.\n\n“If we’re going to get the rest of the world to take serious steps to remedy this problem, we’ve got to do it ourselves,” King said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\nPelosi insisted that Democrats had pieced together other policies in the spending bill that could reduce emissions. “We will have something that will meet the president’s goals,” she said.\n\nDemocrats also want to make progress that could help Democrat Terry McAuliffe win a neck-and-neck Nov. 2 gubernatorial election in Virginia.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, maintained that his caucus will not budge on supporting the infrastructure bill before Oct. 31 if there is no agreement on the broader package, which would be passed under so-called budget reconciliation rules.\n\n“The president needs the reconciliation agreement to go to Glasgow,” Khanna, D-Calif., said on “Fox News Sunday.” He added: “That’s what is going to deal with climate change, that’s what’s going to hit his goals of 50% reduction by 2030. I’m confident we will have an agreement.”", "timestamp": 1635153500, "digest": "F3VG1jgJN78EdJ-DSYn6rCjNqlT1Ftj4DkB3DgF4WfY", "contributor": "0x8545f0833b3238480B8e72e22fC0E69Fa84d1cf2"}

Such storms occur when pressure in the central region of the storm descend by at least 24 millibars (an atmospheric pressure measurement) in 24 hours, according to the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/bombogenesis.html). \n\nThe bomb cyclone has merged with a Category 5 \"atmospheric river\" – giant flowing trains of moist air in the sky.\n\nAtmospheric rivers, like [hurricanes](https://www.livescience.com/22177-hurricanes-typhoons-cyclones.html) and [tornadoes](https://www.livescience.com/21498-tornado-facts.html), are rated based on their potential for damage; a Category 5 is the strongest, or \"most hazardous,\" bringing the chance for gusty winds, flooding, debris flow and mudslides, [according to the California Department of Water Resources](https://twitter.com/CA_DWR/status/1451246916457713664).\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) in Sacramento issued numerous warnings on Sunday (Oct. 24) concerning extreme rainfall, flooding and debris flows. In some regions, rainfall may reach into the double digits in inches.\n\nFlash flood watches are in effect for most of Central and Northern California, *[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/10/24/california-atmospheric-river-soaked/)* reported. Last week, Sacramento received its first rainfall since March 19, ending a 220-day streak without a drop. Now, the region is forecast to receive more than half a foot of rain.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest and Northern California may see near-tornado or hurricane-force winds gust up to 60 mph (97 km/h), along with waves crashing on the shoreline at up to 20 feet (6 meters) high. \n\nThe Bay Area is expected to face a deluge at least through Monday (Oct. 25); Oakland may experience record water levels in an atmospheric column (known as Precipitable WATer value or PWAT); and 5 to 8 inches (12 to 20 centimeters) of rain may fall in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. \n\nRegions that previously faced severe wildfire, such as those hit by the Dixie and Caldor fires, are already receiving reports of debris flows, and flash floods are possible in regions of Sacramento that had fires as long ago as 2018, according to the NWS.\n\nA bomb cyclone has merged with a Category 5 'atmospheric river'. (NOAA)\n\nIt's unusual for a storm like this to happen so early in the season, according to *The Washington Post*. That left emergency responders little time to plan, as they were still battling the wildfires that had plagued California for much of 2021.\n\nThose fires also raise the risk of catastrophic flooding and mudslides. That's because after a fire, soil that would normally soak up rainfall can be as water-repellant as pavement, [according to NWS](https://www.weather.gov/riw/burn_scar_flooding). As that water tumbles downhill, it can also fuel erosion and pick up ash, sand, silt, rocks and burned vegetation, according to NWS. Wildfire burns begin to heal once regrowth happens.\n\nBut \"the early timing of such a major storm means that the 2021 burn scars have had very little opportunity yet for vegetation recovery,\" Amy East, a research geologist with the US Geological Survey in Santa Cruz, wrote in an email to *The Washington Post*.\n\n\"The Dixie Fire is still smoldering, and that area is showing only the very beginning of plant regrowth.\"\n\n**This article was originally published by [Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/).

{"id": "xCjB3JxYvDfE1LWcbWpVtShkPGb-4L2JTaVsbUgXXX4", "title": "A Bomb Cyclone Has Merged With an 'Atmospheric River' to Batter California", "body": "A \"bomb cyclone\" in the Pacific is dumping extreme rain and several feet of snow on California. The wild weather follows a summer of extreme drought and wildfires, and it could bring flooding, mudslides and debris flow to the parched and wildfire-scarred Golden State.\n\nThe term \"bomb cyclone\" refers to the rapid intensification process – \"bombogenesis\" – that forms it. Such storms occur when pressure in the central region of the storm descend by at least 24 millibars (an atmospheric pressure measurement) in 24 hours, according to the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/bombogenesis.html). \n\nThe bomb cyclone has merged with a Category 5 \"atmospheric river\" – giant flowing trains of moist air in the sky.\n\nAtmospheric rivers, like [hurricanes](https://www.livescience.com/22177-hurricanes-typhoons-cyclones.html) and [tornadoes](https://www.livescience.com/21498-tornado-facts.html), are rated based on their potential for damage; a Category 5 is the strongest, or \"most hazardous,\" bringing the chance for gusty winds, flooding, debris flow and mudslides, [according to the California Department of Water Resources](https://twitter.com/CA_DWR/status/1451246916457713664).\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) in Sacramento issued numerous warnings on Sunday (Oct. 24) concerning extreme rainfall, flooding and debris flows. In some regions, rainfall may reach into the double digits in inches.\n\nFlash flood watches are in effect for most of Central and Northern California, *[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/10/24/california-atmospheric-river-soaked/)* reported. Last week, Sacramento received its first rainfall since March 19, ending a 220-day streak without a drop. Now, the region is forecast to receive more than half a foot of rain.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest and Northern California may see near-tornado or hurricane-force winds gust up to 60 mph (97 km/h), along with waves crashing on the shoreline at up to 20 feet (6 meters) high. \n\nThe Bay Area is expected to face a deluge at least through Monday (Oct. 25); Oakland may experience record water levels in an atmospheric column (known as Precipitable WATer value or PWAT); and 5 to 8 inches (12 to 20 centimeters) of rain may fall in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. \n\nRegions that previously faced severe wildfire, such as those hit by the Dixie and Caldor fires, are already receiving reports of debris flows, and flash floods are possible in regions of Sacramento that had fires as long ago as 2018, according to the NWS.\n\nA bomb cyclone has merged with a Category 5 'atmospheric river'. (NOAA)\n\nIt's unusual for a storm like this to happen so early in the season, according to *The Washington Post*. That left emergency responders little time to plan, as they were still battling the wildfires that had plagued California for much of 2021.\n\nThose fires also raise the risk of catastrophic flooding and mudslides. That's because after a fire, soil that would normally soak up rainfall can be as water-repellant as pavement, [according to NWS](https://www.weather.gov/riw/burn_scar_flooding). As that water tumbles downhill, it can also fuel erosion and pick up ash, sand, silt, rocks and burned vegetation, according to NWS. Wildfire burns begin to heal once regrowth happens.\n\nBut \"the early timing of such a major storm means that the 2021 burn scars have had very little opportunity yet for vegetation recovery,\" Amy East, a research geologist with the US Geological Survey in Santa Cruz, wrote in an email to *The Washington Post*.\n\n\"The Dixie Fire is still smoldering, and that area is showing only the very beginning of plant regrowth.\"\n\n**This article was originally published by [Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/).

Van Eck has lodged a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch its Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) “as soon as practicable” and signalled that it will charge a management fee of just 65 basis points. This significantly undercuts the 95bp fee of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which has amassed more than $1bn of assets after chalking up the strongest ever ETF launch last week. Valkyrie Investments’ Bitcoin Fund (BTF), which joined the fray on Friday, also has a fee of 95bp. Nathan Geraci, president of the ETF Store, a Kansas-based financial adviser, believed this is likely to be just the first stage in a battle for investors’ wallets. “BITO has already accrued a huge advantage as first mover . . . The attention around this product is unlike anything in the history of ETFs,” Geraci argued. “That said, at the end of the day, bitcoin futures ETFs are commodity products. Costs matter and I expect a brutal fee war to play out in this category. \\[This\\] is the opening salvo in what will be a ruthless, ongoing fee competition.” Kenneth Lamont, senior fund analyst for passive strategies at Morningstar, said there was “definitely a first-mover advantage” for BITO but believed “if there is a significant fee difference we will see investors switch”. “If you look at other markets you would have seen a similar story \\[of fee compression\\] over the years. I don’t believe the bitcoin is immune to the market pressures,” Lamont added. VanEck’s fee is also markedly cheaper than the 95bp charged by the WisdomTree Bitcoin ETP (BTCW) — the lowest-cost bitcoin exchange traded product available in the far more developed European market, according to data from TrackInsight. Weekly newsletter For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click The WisdomTree fund, like most in Europe, is physically backed by bitcoin, rather than being based on the futures market as its US counterparts are. The SEC has yet to approve any application for spot price-based crypto ETFs. The only cheaper bitcoin ETF in the world, the physically backed CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCX), listed in Canada, charges 40bp, according to TrackInsight. VanEck’s European range of crypto exchange traded notes, which track five virtual currencies including bitcoin, charge between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent. VanEck declined to comment for this story. Michael Sapir, chief executive of ProShares, defended BITO’s fee by arguing that the fund was actively, rather than passively managed, with ProShares’ traders “applying our expertise to roll the \\[futures\\] contracts”, rather than doing so automatically at a fixed point before expiry. However, Lamont was unconvinced this should a major factor. “They call it active, but actively choosing when to roll futures between one day and the next is not like being an active equity manager,” he argued. The nascent fee war leaves the dominant $42bn Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) — a private trust that invests in the spot market — looking expensive, with a 2 per cent annual management fee. David LaValle, global head of ETFs at Grayscale, said it was committed to cutting the fee if and when Grayscale gets approval from the SEC to convert the trust to a spot ETF, which it filed to do last week, but did not suggest any reduction was impending otherwise. “We own 3.5 per cent of all the world’s bitcoin. This is the fee profile we have always had. We feel very comfortable given that we have a product in the marketplace that has very strong liquidity and a very strong asset base,” said LaValle, who argued that the cost of rolling futures contracts incurred by the first wave of US bitcoin ETFs meant GBTC would still have higher returns, despite its higher total expense ratio.", "timestamp": 1635155624, "digest": "0fBNniQRlSfXAF86po8zrKlJeSoyYnPTgmMXYDPvcn0", "contributor": "0xa5A313A41968f058EF5C36ddC1891B51fF57caAD"}

3.0运动的一部分，它从三个主要原则开始：\n\n•开源：所有源代码都应提供给每个人审查；\n\n•民主治理：生态系统的规则应在民主制度下制定；\n\n•分布式控制：理想情况下，应将控制权分配给每一个参与者，并考虑其贡献；\n\n为了使新的去中心化生态系统达到足够的规模，推翻现有的中心化生态系统，我们还需要：\n\n• 包容性：应支持不同类型的现有和未来可能的应用；\n\n• 中立：底层协议不应偏向特定应用；\n\n• 激励：用户、内容创建者和开发者应该给予转换的实质性激励；\n\n以前的点对点系统中有很多成功的公共内容分发想法，例如BitMessage或ZeroNet引入的广播和订阅功能，重点是站点分发。但是，这些系统，包括最初的RSS标准，不包括允许用户之间进行社交互动的规定。虽然Peergos或Mastodon等其他社交网络系统也支持信息发布，\n\n它们要么专注于私有信息的分发，要么由于架构的多样性而倾向于生成超级节点。\n\nRSS3源于RSS的精华，它是一个协议，它允许用户控制自己的数据，开发人员可以轻松构建去中心化的内容和社交网络。\n\n# 2.RSS3标准\n\n一切都从RSS3标准开始。与最初的RSS标准相比，RSS3更轻便、更简单、更强大、更高效、更可扩展。具体而言，RSS3在以下方面有所不同：\n\n•文件格式从XML更改为JSON，以简化和高效；\n\n•加密密钥被用于验证和认证文件，确保数据完整性和所有权；\n\n•文件通过链接和反向链接连接；\n\n•实现与上游和上下文的内容交互；\n\n•不同的mime类型支持不同形式的内容\n\n•下一个项目和下一个列表用于支持历史记录；\n\nRSS3文件被设计为包含五种基本属性：\n\n•信息属性：文件的基本信息，如id、版本、更新日期等；\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/raZ84yyD0cVXvARzfq1x_.png?height=1440&width=1743)\n\n•所有权属性：用于加密验证所有权的变量；\n\n•配置文件属性：身份信息-如头像、昵称和兴趣。私有属性是加密的；\n\n•链接属性：与其他RSS3文件的关系。多种类型的关系可以被不同用途的应用程序所定义；\n\n•项目属性：文件所有者发布的所有项目。与原始RSS类似，此处仅存储元数据和指针；\n\n与最初的RSS不同，RSS只提供最新的项目，引入了“项目链”来创建项目文件的链接列表，完全由文件所有者控制。\n\n对于更复杂的用例，应用程序可以在用户同意的情况下添加自定义变量。有关更多详细信息，请访问https://github.com/NaturalSelectionLabs/RSS3.\n\n# 3.托管\n\n## 3.1概述\n\nRSS3托管是一个为RSS3协议服务的点对点系统。一般来说，在这个系统中有三方：节点、用户和第三方应用程序。通常，用户指的是角色背后的真实人物，他们在多个平台上运行节点客户端，包括服务器、笔记本电脑、移动电话甚至嵌入式系统，这些平台都是点对点连接的。核心托管部分最强调的是让用户完全控制和访问他们的数据，应该是一个通用的共享分布式系统。因此，它与应用层解耦，这让用户可以自由切换应用程序，并给开发人员足够的灵活性。开发者可以在分布式节点上自由构建具有友好前端UI的第三方应用程序，这些节点可以是移动应用程序、桌面应用程序、浏览器扩展程序，或其他任何东西。关于中间件和第三方应用程序的进一步讨论见第五节和第六节。\n\n每个托管节点包含三个组件，如图2所示：（1）作为全局文件存储系统的固定内容存储（IPFS），（2）指向RSS3文件或帖子的CID的RSS3指针，以及（3）通信模块，负责将RSS3指针与其他节点同步并处理最终用户查询。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UIVRouCP0HVRid6Wm9S5H.png?height=1440&width=1691)\n\n## 3.2固定内容储存\n\n从理论上讲，可以使用本地文件存储系统作为存储基础，但在实践中，它可能会阻碍可扩展性。因此，我们提出了一种系统，其中所有节点都使用固定内容存储系统IPFS，这意味着所有RSS3文件都存储在IPFS上。每个RSS3文件都应该是可读写的，任何角色都有特定的限制。因此，存储系统不应该有基于角色的访问控制，因此IPFS是一个理想的选择。此外，不同于Arweave，IPFS不需要节点与之交互的令牌，这使得最终用户和开发人员能够更灵活、更容易地开始使用它。\n\n## 3.3 RSS3指针\n\n因为我们只能用CID在IPFS上搜索，所以需要一些索引表。默认情况下，每个节点承载从用户地址到用户RSS3文件的CID的映射。由所有节点承载的表构成全局分布的表。\n\n此外，针对不同模块的特定用途，还将提供可选的索引表，第六节将对此进行进一步讨论\n\n将来，可以鼓励节点索引和存储索引值。\n\n## 3.4通信模块\n\n一方面，来自最终用户或第三方应用程序的查询将由通信模块处理。通常，有两种类型的查询：post和subscribe。一旦节点查询订阅RSS3文件，通信模块将首先从分布式RSS3文件表中查找CID，然后从IPFS查询整个RSS3文件，最后还回来。一旦节点查询发布消息，在验证之后，它将更新分布式RSS3文件表。一些高级查询（包括更新索引主题列表或订阅主题）共享类似的工作流。\n\n为了维护分布式表，不同节点之间必须进行通信。表上的每个更新都将被广播，接收更新的节点将进行数据完整性验证。如果比现有版本更新，则节点将更新其本地版本。\n\n从物理上讲，每个节点都可以在远程服务器、个人计算机甚至嵌入式系统上运行。对于公共IP，通信非常简单。对于私有IP，我们使用中继进行NAT遍历。具体来说，对于支持IPv6的用户，可以在IPv6上建立连接。此外，为了最大限度地提高信息流量，还将支持Wi-Fi和蓝牙连接。\n\n## 3.5可扩展性\n\n对于对等系统，必须考虑可伸缩性。对于存储层，IPFS可以保证可扩展性。由于RSS3文件只包含元数据，因此将有足够的磁盘空间用于冗余。与此同时，IPFS社区同样致力于提高可扩展性。因此存储层的可扩展性不应构成挑战。\n\n就RSS3指针而言，由于任何CID都小于64字节，且20字节以太坊兼容地址被用作用户公共地址，因此RSS3文件表的一个条目应小于84字节。假设我们为这个表分配了1GB的空间，我们可以在这个空间中保存1200万个条目。但我们预计RSS3主机将有数十亿\n\n将来可能需要TB甚至更多空间的条目的数量。解决这个问题的一种方法是使用自聚合方法创建子对等组，从BitMessage中学习。\n\n# 4.所有权\n\n随着RSS3的引入，数据所有权得到了重组。用户通常有两种类型的数据，一种是对公众开放的数据，另一种是只有特定用户才能读取的数据。在中心化系统下，数据访问通常具有表1所示的结构：\n\nRSS3有一个完全不同的数据所有权系统。加密身份验证的使用确保只有用户才能控制，同时打破不同应用程序之间的隔阂，如表2所示。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zKMTGw3PPVN7u39jSOefj.png?height=980&width=1660)\n\n## 4.1给用户带来的改变\n\n这是第一次，用户不必将其存储和写入权限委托给中心化的一方，这通常会导致数据侵权、丢失或泄漏。此外，用户不受任何特定应用程序或平台的约束，因为他们现有的内容和关系可以轻松地携带到他们决定使用的任何新的应用程序中。公共内容现在可以从任何应用程序访问，这允许更多用户访问，从而产生更高的影响力覆盖率。\n\n用户将永远不会因为毫无根据的规定而被禁止。即使某些应用程序（在非常罕见的情况下）确实在本地禁止它们，它们也可以随时获取数据并切换到其他应用程序。审查制度也在很大程度上受到压制，只有一些特定的案例，如父母控制。用户将体验社交媒体和通信应用程序，就像他们现在在以太坊上与DAPP交互一样。他们将只需要一个分布式身份管理器来管理所有的角色，将其用于自己的特定用途，然后使用自己的私钥进行签名。\n\n## 4.2给开发者带来的改变\n\n开发人员现在可以观察、研究和利用一个巨大的公共数据集。在Web2.0时代，平台严格保护自己的数据集，使得外部开发人员无法使用，即使这些数据是最终用户创建的公共内容。使用RSS3，您可以启动“Instagram”，而无需担心如何获得前100万张图片供用户查看：公共UGC已经存在，就像以太坊网络上的交易历史一样。由于除了用户本身之外，没有人可以控制用户数据，因此新的应用程序及其背后的开发人员与现有应用程序相比不再处于严重劣势。如果一个应用程序能够提供更好的用户体验，那么它将被允许更好地为用户服务，而不是因为数据不足而失败。过去为了争夺自己的数据垄断权而相互竞争的应用程序将共同为整个生态系统构建更丰富的数据集。\n\n# 5.应用程序\n\n最初的RSS标准被设计成一种只关注内容的web合成。通过引入RSS3文件之间的链接，可以形成网络。这些链接进一步使RSS3能够授权不同类型的内容和社交网络，包括但不限于：\n\n## 5.1传统媒体网络\n\n传统媒体网络是指仅指定特定节点来创建和发布内容，而其他节点只能选择是否订阅的内容网络类型。这种类型的网络通常具有较高的平均内容质量，因为选择了可以发布的网络。它还可以提高每个内容的覆盖率，覆盖率由受影响的节点数除以节点总数来定义。这些网络中的内容创作者的主要目的通常是从用户那里获得更多的印象，用户通常都在寻找高质量的内容。然而，由于内容和活动节点有限，这些网络的链路密度预计较低，见图3。这些网络将由向特定用户添加特定标签的应用程序创建，这些用户的内容将显示在订阅者的时间表上。这些应用程序可以是集团报纸、传统有线电视和其他面向内容的网络。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p8w5XVOGpbc170gXRbe6d.png?height=1008&width=1178)\n\n## 5.2社交媒体网络\n\n社交媒体网络指的是所有节点都拥有相同的发布和关注权限的网络。在这些网络中，内容创建者只是用户。由于每个人都有相同的发帖权，用户通常有影响力和社交的混合目的。过去十年中大部分成功的社交和内容网络都属于这一类，包括Twitter、Instagram和Tiktok。尽管它不像传统媒体网络那样具有高平均内容覆盖率或高平均内容质量，但更多的节点被激活以创建，从而导致更繁荣的生态系统。如图4所示，预期这两个系统都具有更高的链路密度定向和双向链接。应用程序可以帮助用户创建不同形式的内容，然后根据特定需求提供不同的内容消费体验。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Nc-szoaNFMDNH6mFigwO2.png?height=1178&width=1492)\n\n## 5.3通信网络\n\n通信网络是指那些节点可以自由地相互连接，主要目的是社交的网络。这些类型的网络中只存在双向链接，内容主要是为一小部分人（只要不是一个人）创建的。WhatsApp、微信和Facebook Messenger就是这一类的例子。通过利用RSS3文件之间的链接，应用程序可以轻松地与其他开源和对等协议（如WebRTC）一起构建通信网络。图5显示了通信网络的外观。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T3pVTC91eDhWef-N553_s.png?height=938&width=1130)\n\n# 6.模块化\n\n如上所述，RSS3标准和RSS3主机足以构建基本应用程序。然而，作为一个开放的生态系统，RSS3被设计为具有不同的可扩展性模块。就像开发基于RSS3的应用程序一样，开发人员可以在没有任何许可的情况下为系统创建不同的模块。为了支持不同用途的应用程序，我们在此提出一些可能的中间件，这些中间件可以构建在RSS3之上，从而释放出巨大的可能性。\n\n## 6.1付费解锁\n\nRSS3的内容分发系统中可以添加付费解锁模块，这为内容创作者带来了一系列不同的货币化可能性。我们预计付费解锁模块将基于加密学和去中心化托管构建。付费解锁可以按内容使用，用户直接向创建者付费换取解密密钥，也可以与订阅模型一起使用，用户在特定时间段内支付密钥以解锁一系列特殊内容。应用程序还可以利用RSS3文件中的链接和NFT相关资产属性，以实现更好的付费订阅关系。\n\n## 6.2全局索引\n\n当然，在RSS3系统本身中，没有简单的方法可以获得所有已发布项目的全局索引。最好在将来引入去中心化的全局索引服务。通过这种方式，应用程序将能够为用户提供“探索”功能，以便更好地发现新内容和用户关注。此外，这还将使应用程序能够从全局数据集进行筛选。这些过滤器可以是标签、媒体类型、创建者类型或不同属性的组合。有了过滤器，eBay和Zillow等市场应用程序、Reddit和Quora等论坛应用程序以及Pinterest和Dribble等内容应用程序就可以显现。\n\n## 6.3内容标签\n\n为了使系统实现更高的内容分发效率，节点标记内容的透明方式非常有用。与全局索引一起，我们可以期望为最终用户提供更好的搜索和排名体验。我们期望内容标签也由分散的RSS3节点执行，节点可以选择是否要为任务投入额外的计算资源。因此，使用节点放置的标签的应用程序应该为服务付费。为实现相对普遍的采用，可能需要一个内容标签标准。\n\n## 6.4兴趣图谱\n\n最终用户的兴趣图谱对于更好的用户体验也很重要。与中心化式的服务不同，中心化式服务中的用户活动都在中心化服务器中进行跟踪和分析，RSS3生态系统的兴趣图谱应该是一个离线的模块，并且可能具有统一的标准。兴趣图谱只能由开源应用程序使用私钥加密字符串的结果进行更新。因此，用户可以对不同用户体验的任何应用程序感兴趣。此外，应用程序应该让用户完全控制他们是否想要推荐增强的体验，并允许他们随时选择退出。\n\n# 7.风险模型\n\n## 7.1数据篡改\n\n我们的节点有两个可能的篡改点：IPFS存储系统和指针表。\n\n对于具有足够副本的IPFS存储系统，基本上不可能完全删除某些文件。只要指针表得到正确维护，用户数据就不会被篡改。\n\n由于在我们的系统中，公钥用作用户地址，每个RSS3文件（除所有权属性外，有四个基本部分）都附有签名，因此节点可以轻松验证数据和海报是否被伪造，并决定是否同意指针更新。\n\n如果某个节点行为不正常，则只修改其本地存储。连接到它的可信节点会拒绝更新，这样全局分布式指针表就不会被破坏。通过这种方式，节点可以信任他们接收的内容，而不必信任他们从中接收内容的对等方。由于最终用户可以轻松地自己启动一个节点，因此他们没有动机从另一个可疑节点进行查询。此外，将来我们可以有惩罚机制。\n\n## 7.2DDoS\n\n传统DDoS攻击的目标是一个或几个托管web服务的集中式服务器。在RSS3系统中，内容是大规模分布的，并且将有许多节点承载同一内容，因此，将所有节点淹没更加困难。\n\n为了减轻特定内容对专用节点的本地攻击，每个节点可以自由断开任何传入连接或设置带宽限制规则。\n\n## 7.3审查制度\n\nRSS3网络上可能存在两种形式的审查：以用户为目标的审查和以内容为目标的审查。\n\n除非每个节点都同意封锁，否则不可能封锁某个用户。只要存在索引用户RSS3文件的CID的节点，就无法阻止该用户。\n\n内容审查可能基于每个平台或应用程序。然而，只要第三方应用程序协调努力在IPFS或其他地方复制此类内容，原始帖子就不会丢失。\n\n至于对特定帖子的评论，不可能在RSS3系统中审查其帖子的评论。我们建议采用一种系统，将评论记录在评论者的RSS3文件中，只有评论者可以更新自己的内容。\n\n此外，单个RSS3文件不能被任意阻止。随着越来越多的节点加入RSS3网络，并且随着网络的连接和可扩展性越来越强，预计阻止单个RSS3文件将变得越来越困难，因为没有人有能力完全阻止此类文件。审查仍然可以在集中的“代理网关”级别进行，但是，如果启动一个节点既简单又便宜，最终用户就没有动力从这样的网关进行查询。\n\n# 8.结论\n\n一种用于构建“不能作恶”内容和社交网络的协议被提出。我们首先提出了一个新设计的标准，该标准源于最初的RSS标准。通过引入基于密码的身份验证和文件之间的链接，整个系统实现了分散的数据所有权，并可以支持各种类型的网络。与最初的RSS生态系统不同，不同的RSS文件通常存储在子数据中心，将为RSS3构建对等托管服务，因此形成任何数据超级大国的可能性极低。RSS3的灵活性和适应性使其能够支持各种类型的内容和社交网络，无论是现有的还是尚未创建的。\n\n# 9.致谢\n\n我们感谢Dave Winer和RSS-DEV工作组为最初的RSS标准所做的努力，这在很大程度上促进了开放web。我们感谢Suji Yan和ByteDave的大力支持和建议，帮助RSS3成为可能。我们感谢Guo Liu和Yisi Liu关于RSS3标准设计的想法。我们感谢投资者一直以来对我们的支持。我们感谢我们的家人和合作伙伴容忍我们糟糕的睡眠时间（相信我们，我们很快就会从屏幕前离开）。\n\n**最后，谢谢你，中本聪，无论你身在何处。**\n\n# 参考资料\n\n\\[1\\] Zeronet - 去中心化的p2p网络平台.\n\n\\[2\\] Hilary Andersson. 社交媒体应用程序“故意”让用户上瘾,

{"id": "L9JDZ0L3cnLyFU_xtE8cMgKlcf0QYimAAd09vBfYBA4", "title": "EXPLAINER: What the metaverse is and how it will work", "body": "LONDON (AP) — The term “metaverse” seems to be everywhere. [Facebook is hiring thousands of engineers in Europe](https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-europe-european-union-0c02c959c0b73b84ce77df9bc557d9b9) to work on it, while video game companies are outlining their long-term visions for what some consider the next big thing online.\n\nThe metaverse, which could spring up again when Facebook releases earnings Monday, is the latest buzzword to capture the tech industry’s imagination.\n\nIt could be the future, or it could be the latest grandiose vision by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that doesn’t turn out as expected or isn’t widely adopted for years — if at all.\n\nPlus, many have concerns about a new online world tied to a social media giant that could get access to even more personal data and is accused of failing to stop harmful content.\n\nHere’s what this online world is all about:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWHAT IS THE METAVERSE?\n\nThink of it as the internet brought to life, or at least rendered in 3D. Zuckerberg has described it as a “virtual environment” you can go inside of — instead of just looking at on a screen. Essentially, it’s a world of endless, interconnected virtual communities where people can meet, work and play, using virtual reality headsets, augmented reality glasses, smartphone apps or other devices.\n\n### TECHNOLOGY\n\n#### Whistleblower Haugen to testify as UK scrutinizes Facebook\n\n#### Facebook dithered in curbing divisive user content in India\n\n#### Amid the Capitol riot, Facebook faced its own insurrection\n\n#### Australia wants Facebook to seek parental consent for kids\n\nIt also will incorporate other aspects of online life such as shopping and social media, according to Victoria Petrock, an analyst who follows emerging technologies.\n\n“It’s the next evolution of connectivity where all of those things start to come together in a seamless, doppelganger universe, so you’re living your virtual life the same way you’re living your physical life,” she said.\n\nBut keep in mind that “it’s hard to define a label to something that hasn’t been created,” said Tuong Nguyen, an analyst who tracks immersive technologies for research firm Gartner.\n\nFacebook warned it would take 10 to 15 years to develop responsible products for the metaverse, a term coined by writer Neal Stephenson for his 1992 science fiction novel “Snow Crash.”\n\nWHAT WILL I BE ABLE TO DO IN THE METAVERSE?\n\nThings like go to a virtual concert, take a trip online, and buy and try on digital clothing.\n\nThe metaverse also could be a game-changer for the work-from-home shift amid the coronavirus pandemic. Instead of seeing co-workers on a video call grid, employees could see them virtually.\n\nFacebook has launched meeting software for companies, called Horizon Workrooms, to use with its Oculus VR headsets, though early reviews have not been great. The headsets cost $300 or more, putting the metaverse’s most cutting-edge experiences out of reach for many.\n\nFor those who can afford it, users would be able, through their avatars, to flit between virtual worlds created by different companies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“A lot of the metaverse experience is going to be around being able to teleport from one experience to another,” Zuckerberg says.\n\nTech companies still have to figure out how to connect their online platforms to each other. Making it work will require competing technology platforms to agree on a set of standards, so there aren’t “people in the Facebook metaverse and other people in the Microsoft metaverse,” Petrock said.\n\nIS FACEBOOK GOING ALL IN ON THE METAVERSE?\n\nIndeed, Zuckerberg is going big on what he sees as the next generation of the internet because he thinks it’s going to be a big part of the digital economy. He expects people to start seeing Facebook as a metaverse company in coming years rather than a social media company.\n\nA [report](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735612/facebook-change-company-name-metaverse) by tech news site The Verge said Zuckerberg is looking at using Facebook’s annual virtual reality conference this coming week to announce a corporate name change, putting legacy apps like Facebook and Instagram under a metaverse-focused parent company. Facebook hasn’t commented on the report.\n\nCritics wonder if the potential pivot could be an effort to distract from the company’s crises, including antitrust crackdowns, testimony by [whistleblowing former employees](https://apnews.com/article/facebook-haugen-congress-testimony-1daac7a76ca7bf0b0802cc46e732b51b) and concerns about its handling of misinformation.\n\nFormer employee Frances Haugen, who accused Facebook’s platforms of harming children and inciting political violence, plans to testify Monday before a United Kingdom parliamentary committee looking to pass online safety legislation.\n\nIS THE METAVERSE JUST A FACEBOOK PROJECT?\n\nNo. Zuckerberg has acknowledged that “no one company” will build the metaverse by itself.\n\nJust because Facebook is making a big deal about the metaverse doesn’t mean that it or another tech giant will dominate the space, Nguyen said.\n\n“There are also a lot of startups that could be potential competitors,” he said. “There are new technologies and trends and applications that we’ve yet to discover.”\n\nVideo game companies also are taking a leading role. Epic Games, the company behind the popular Fortnite video game, has raised $1 billion from investors to help with its long-term plans for building the metaverse. Game platform Roblox is another big player, outlining its vision of the metaverse as a place where “people can come together within millions of 3D experiences to learn, work, play, create and socialize.”\n\nConsumer brands are getting in on it, too. Italian fashion house Gucci collaborated in June with Roblox to sell a collection of digital-only accessories. Coca-Cola and Clinique have sold digital tokens pitched as a stepping stone to the metaverse.\n\nZuckerberg’s embrace of the metaverse in some ways contradicts a central tenet of its biggest enthusiasts. They envision the metaverse as online culture’s liberation from tech platforms like Facebook that assumed ownership of people’s accounts, photos, posts and playlists and traded off what they gleaned from that data.\n\n“We want to be able to move around the internet with ease, but we also want to be able to move around the internet in a way we’re not tracked and monitored,” said venture capitalist Steve Jang, a managing partner at Kindred Ventures who focuses on cryptocurrency technology.\n\nWILL THIS BE ANOTHER WAY TO GET MORE OF MY DATA?\n\nIt seems clear that Facebook wants to carry its business model, which is based on using personal data to sell targeted advertising, into the metaverse.\n\n“Ads are going to continue being an important part of the strategy across the social media parts of what we do, and it will probably be a meaningful part of the metaverse, too,” Zuckerberg said in the company’s most recent earnings call.\n\nThat raises fresh privacy concerns, Nguyen said, involving “all the issues that we have today, and then some we’ve yet to discover because we’re still figuring out what the metaverse will do.”\n\nPetrock she said she’s concerned about Facebook trying to lead the way into a virtual world that could require even more personal data and offer greater potential for abuse and misinformation when it hasn’t fixed those problems in its current platforms.\n\n“I don’t think they fully thought through all the pitfalls,” she said. “I worry they’re not necessarily thinking through all the privacy implications of the metaverse.”", "timestamp": 1635155680, "digest": "Pbx_p4BJQvH2PGdpng07oPJv3e4C7FNr3bNaErpONww", "contributor": "0x445D2E92B9b68e0254f0d0F5FFDbbB8AD476AfbA"}

One later identified himself as a member of the North Port Police Department, and the other works for the FBI, according to Laundrie family attorney Steve Bertolino.\n\n**[BRIAN LAUNDRIE SEARCH: HUMAN REMAINS FOUND NEAR FLORIDA FUGITIVE'S BELONGINGS IN PARK](https://www.foxnews.com/us/brian-laundrie-search-parents-florida-park-police-hunt-fugitive)**\n\nThe men said nothing at the park entrance and followed the Laundries from a distance of no less than 50 feet.\n\n* next\n\n  Image 1 of 10\n\n  Images obtained exclusively by Fox News show Chris and Roberta Laundrie in the  Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park with at least one law enforcement officer on Wednesday (Fox News Digital/Michael Ruiz)\n\nThere were no other people present at that time – although later that morning at least three bystanders came through the area – a man walking his dog, a woman walking her dog and a man on a bicycle. All of them were encountered under the power lines outside of the trail where investigators found Brian Laundrie’s remains that morning.\n\nThe parents entered the park on foot, with Roberta carrying a red backpack that appeared stuffed with water bottles, the outline of which were easily seen bulging through the fabric. Chris’ hands were empty, and his pockets did not appear full.\n\n**[GABBY PETITO HOMICIDE: TIMELINE OF DISAPPEARANCE WITH BRIAN LAUNDRIE](https://www.foxnews.com/us/gabby-petito-timeline-missing-woman-cross-country-road-trip?preview=true)**\n\nThe couple walked at a steady pace toward the Live Long trail, just off of South Powerline Trail in Sarasota County’s Big Slough Preserve. Before they entered there, they peeked into brush nearby, returning empty handed but complaining about the presence of a reporter and asking to be given at least 25 feet of space.\n\nThen they entered the Live Long trail next to a wooden marker labeled 149 at around 7:40 a.m. – with Chris repeatedly stepping into areas of brush, popping back out at least a half dozen times.\n\nThe two law enforcement agents remained far behind, although within sight.\n\nChris and Roberta Laundrie stood in this same area Wednesday morning. The bush in the lower middle part of the photo can be seen to Roberta's right in pictures taken from the ground. (WTVT)\n\nAt around 8 a.m., Chris split off into an area of brush and Roberta walked up the main trail. The officers followed Chris, who rejoined Roberta without them about 12 minutes later, with his pants wet up to his knees.\n\n**[BRIAN LAUNDRIE WAS 'GRIEVING' WHEN HE VANISHED, BEFORE PETITO FOUND DEAD, LAWYER SAYS: LIVE UPDATES](https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/brian-laundry-gabby-petito-remains)**\n\nBy then, Roberta made her way to the edge of a clearing that police cordoned off after telling the parents that they’d discovered human remains and some of Brian’s personal belongings.\n\nExclusive photos show Chris and Roberta Laundrie were just a few yards away from where police found their son's belongings and remains Wednesday morning. (Michael Ruiz/Fox News Digital)\n\nShe was about 15 yards from where investigators set up a blue tent and within a ring of yellow caution tape that appeared in news helicopter footage later that day.\n\nTwenty yards in the other direction is where police set up a white tent in the brush. Investigators were seen searching both locations, a short distance up the trail from the dry bag.\n\nChris came back and met Roberta at the edge of that clearing. They spoke in whispers and turned back toward the entrance of the trail around 8:15 a.m.\n\nThrough their attorney, they said that they had not seen anything in that immediate area at the time. Neither did the reporter present. The parents also said they had not been told by authorities exactly where their son’s remains had been found.\n\nSpokespersons for the North Port Police Department and FBI both declined to specify which location contained Brian’s remains and which contained other items of interest. But the Laundries did not walk into either location or place any items on the ground in the area.\n\n  (Michael Ruiz/Fox News Digital)\n\nAlso in the immediate area is a rope swing – but it looks to be different from the one Brian Laundrie posed on with his nephew in a July 2020 [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCUnohJF5s-/) image taken in the area.\n\nOn Sunday, a group of people including TikTok user @chroniclesofolivia returned to the area where Chris and Roberta found the dry bag and discovered some bone fragments and a Nalgene-style water bottle with labeling from a Seattle REI Co-op. An identical bottle can be seen 7 minutes and 27 seconds into Gabby Petito's \"van life\" [YouTube](https://youtu.be/2PStpXFEfIs?t=447) video.\n\nThis screengrab from the Nomadic Statik YouTube video appears to show the same water bottle hanging on the left side of the van door.\n\nPolice collected the bones but could not determine at the scene whether they were human or animal. They left the bottle behind and later said none of the items found Sunday were tied to the investigation. The department's spokesman did not immediately respond when shown the screengrab from Petito's video.\n\n\"I feel it was very negligent, it was irresponsible,\" Olivia told Fox News. \"They were more interested in the bones – but they knew they were animal bones.\"\n\nRichard Stafford, the attorney for Petito's parents, said he didn't understand why police would have left the bottle behind.\n\n\"It looks like hers,\" he said. \"We have a picture that's from before she left for her trip. It looks like that bottle. I don't know why it would be left there.\"\n\nLaundrie's parents had gone into the park on Sept. 13 and 14 to search the same area, Bertolino said, but it was dark and raining the first night and underwater the next day. It’s also the same area where they told investigators they believed their son may have gone all along, he added, and where Chris searched with police in early October.\n\nAt the height of the flooding, water levels were 8 to 10 feet higher, a North Port officer told Fox News Digital. And the FBI said earlier this week that authorities discovered Brian’s remains in an area that had previously been underwater.\n\n**[BRIAN LAUNDRIE SEARCH: FBI CONFIRMS UNIDENTIFIED HUMAN REMAINS, FUGITIVE'S BACKPACK AND NOTEBOOK FOUND](https://www.foxnews.com/us/fbi-brian-laundrie-human-remains-manhunt)**\n\nAt around 8:20 a.m. on Wednesday, Chris led Roberta through a patch of brambles and other brush toward the edge of a clearing roughly 20 yards off the main trail. \n\nAs the reporter followed, he put his phone away to brush the thorns aside and enter the clearing, observing the parents pick up a white dry bag and a dark object.\n\nThe parents put the item into the bag. Their body language immediately following this discovery can be seen on video – and they began their trek back to the power lines. Bertolino later said the bag belonged to Brian but said he could not specify what the parents found along with it.\n\n[Video](http://video.foxnews.com/v/6278226274001)\n\nBeginning at 8:30 a.m., Chris spoke with Bertolino twice on the phone and also with a North Port detective, the lawyer later said. The parents stood under the power lines in direct sunlight until the detective met them at around 8:41 a.m.\n\nOnly some of their conversation could be overheard.\n\n\"I think we might have found something,\" the detective said at one point. \n\nBertolino later explained that the parents were shown images of a backpack on the officer’s phone and asked to confirm whether it belonged to Brian. They said yes. The officer then informed them that human remains had been found nearby and asked them to leave the park, go home and wait for an update.\n\nExclusive Fox News Digital video captured the exchange. The officer placed a hand on Chris’ shoulder. Roberta wiped what appeared to be a tear from his eye. And both parents looked visibly shaken.\n\nThey returned home a few minutes past 9 a.m.\n\n**[BRIAN LAUNDRIE FOUND DEAD, FBI CONFIRMS REMAINS](https://www.foxnews.com/us/brian-laundrie-remains-confirmed-by-fbi)**\n\nThe detective then stated that the park would soon be closed and that he was blocking the entrance to preserve evidence. Within minutes, police arrived in force and officially shut down the area.\n\nHours later, the FBI announced investigators had recovered human remains as well as a backpack and notebook belonging to Brian Laundrie. They confirmed the remains as his through dental records the following day, although a cause and manner of death had not yet been determined as of Saturday. A forensic anthropologist will assist the investigation.\n\nBertolino told Fox News’ Claudia Kelly-Bazan Saturday that Brian would eventually be cremated and that the family would forego a funeral.\n\n**[CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP](https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink)**\n\nBrian Laundrie was the sole person of interest in the strangling of his former fiancée, Gabby Petito, whose remains investigators found on Sept. 19 at a Wyoming campsite weeks after the couple had stayed there.\n\nWhen Fox News returned to the park after it reopened Friday, there was clear evidence that authorities had come and gone -- cleared brush, trampled grass and fresh tire marks in the muddy ground. Grass near where the parents found Brian’s white dry bag had been marked in orange spray paint, brambles cut away, and there flags placed in the soil. Orange paint marked other areas nearby, just yards away from where the parents passed Wednesday morning.\n\nOn Saturday, a Fox News drone captured images of a massive hog charging through the same clearing where Roberta had paused just days earlier, at the heart of the search area. Several pools of water still hadn’t receded.", "timestamp": 1635155385, "digest": "mdaQ1zePZYpuqnuJiBrVyk8o1hgVgo301_NnaqB0X4w", "contributor": "0xCfc76E86305228994324774C3Bdc98272a4700f3"}

At present travellers from Hong Kong to the mainland must still undergo quarantine.\n\n\"Hong Kong’s status as an (international financial centre) is increasingly at risk along with its long-term economic recovery and competitiveness as a premier place to do business,\" Mark Austen chief executive of Asifma wrote in open letter to Hong Kong's financial secretary Paul Chan.\n\nThe letter made a series of recommendations including publishing \"a roadmap for exiting Hong Kong’s ‘zero-case’ based COVID-19 strategy beyond solely the immediate goal of opening borders with China\", as well as prioritising vaccinations.\n\nHong Kong has reported just over 12,300 cases since the start of the pandemic, mostly imported, and 213 deaths.\n\nRegional rival [Singapore is expanding quarantine-free travel ](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vaccinated-singapore-shows-zero-covid-countries-cost-reopening-2021-10-22/)to nearly a dozen countries, but authorities are grappling with how to do so while averting a surge of Covid-19 cases among older people and those with weak immune systems.\n\nReporting by Alun John; Editing by Michael Perry", "timestamp": 1635156010, "digest": "Rrw0W9gNvb6uENYcUZOPa_F4xzZ5eEqslg9roC8vMq4", "contributor": "0x3dD2445439d0e0b486114E6168109d8644d9C712"}

And the machines it has are ageing.\n\nThe problems mean as demand has increased, performance has deteriorated.\n\nThe aim is to get these tests done within six weeks of referral, unless it is an urgent cancer case.\n\nBut currently around a quarter of patients wait longer than that. Before the pandemic fewer than 5% did.\n\nThe funding will help, in time, improve the situation.\n\nBut the big issue that it does not tackle is staffing - there is a shortage of specialists to carry out these tests.\n\nAround one in 10 posts are currently vacant.\n\nThere are various reasons for this, including more part-time working, the numbers retiring and problems recruiting internationally because of the pandemic.\n\nBuying new machines is much easier than training, recruiting and retaining staff. Until that is resolved, many are sceptical about what this announcement will actually achieve.\n\nWaiting lists have grown as routine operations were cancelled throughout the pandemic and people who put off seeking help for symptoms come forward.\n\nSome of those in the healthcare sector warned it was not enough to keep up with costs and demand.\n\nChristopher Rigby, an NHS radiographer from Yorkshire, said: \"We haven't got the workforce to staff the hospitals we have now let alone all these new centres.\"\n\nNHS Providers - which speaks for hospital and other NHS trusts - warned the health service needed more staff to deliver services.\n\nA body representing healthcare leaders, the NHS Confederation, said the funding \"falls short of what is needed to get services completely back on track\".\n\n## Booster invites\n\nThe NHS is sending out a further two million invites for Covid booster jabs this week.\n\nThe health secretary said \"we should actively be looking at\" making jabs mandatory for NHS staff, as they are for care workers.\n\nMr Javid told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would wear a face covering during Wednesday's Budget announcement in the Commons.\n\nBut he said now was not time to activate England's \"Plan B\", that would make face masks mandatory in many places.\n\n**Are you an NHS professional or patient affected by the NHS backlog?

Israel later insisted some Biden administration officials were notified ahead of time.\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Editionby email and never miss our top stories\n\nNewsletter email addressGET IT\n\nBy signing up, you agree to the [terms](https://www.timesofisrael.com/terms)\n\nIn the Sunday briefing, the senior official told reporters that the intelligence connecting the organizations to the PFLP was “ironclad.” He said the material included “unequivocal evidence that includes video footage, photos, payment receipts that tie the said groups to the backing of terror activity.”\n\nThe pattern of activity in using civilian organizations as a cover for terror activity and financing is a familiar method for the PFLP, he said.\n\nDefense Minister Benny Gantz attends a Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee meeting at the Knesset, on October 19, 2021. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\n\nIsrael is aware of the significance of declaring the groups terror organizations, the official said, adding that thorough preparation had been made before the announcement, with all relevant entities provided with the evidence.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUS State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that Israel did not warn Washington of the move. Israeli officials, speaking anonymously, denied the charge.\n\nOne of those who reviewed the evidence against the six Palestinian groups was State Prosecutor Amit Aisman, Haaretz reported. It was only after Aisman gave his approval that the Shin Bet reported its findings to Gantz, the report said.\n\nAisman reviewed material showing that, in some cases, only the managers of the rights groups knew that cash was being funneled to the PFLP, while more junior activists were unaware.\n\nJustice Ministry officials have already prepared for any petitions against the terror designations, the report said. Gantz, for the time being, does not plan to open a criminal investigation into any of the groups’ members.\n\nA source familiar with the legal preparations said that according to a 2016 anti-terror law, a human rights organization can be declared a terror group if it is found to have helped a terror group over time, is tied to such a group, or acts on its behalf, even if it also carrying out humanitarian work. The source said the Shin Bet evidence showed that the links between the PFLP and the involved rights groups surpassed the minimum threshold for the law to be applied.\n\nState Prosecutor Amit Eisman, at the Ministry of Justice in Jerusalem, June 28, 2021. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\n\nAccording to Hebrew media reports, Gantz did not tell Prime Minister Naftali Bennett that he was going to sign off on classifying the rights groups as terror organizations. A statement on behalf of Gantz said that such procedures do not require informing the prime minister.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOther ministers were also unaware of the development ahead of time. During a meeting of coalition faction chiefs on Sunday, Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz and Transportation Minister Merav Michaeli, leaders of the Meretz and Labor parties, respectively, complained to Bennett that Gantz had acted alone on the matter, Hebrew media reported.\n\nHorowitz demanded to be shown the evidence tying the rights groups to the terror activities. Gantz, who was not at the meeting, later responded that, while he was prepared to discuss the matter, he was adamant that the evidence not be presented to the full cabinet, which he said was too broad a forum. Gantz said he was willing to present the material to the security cabinet or one of the relevant sub-committees of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.\n\nPublic Security Minister Omer Barlev said Sunday that the [issue was never discussed in the security cabinet](https://www.timesofisrael.com/minister-says-outlawing-of-palestinian-groups-didnt-come-up-in-security-cabinet/), and he that had not seen any of the material tying the groups to the PFLP.\n\nHealth Minister Nitzan Horowitz leads a Meretz party faction meeting in Jerusalem on October 18, 2021 (Olivier Fitoussi/Flash90)\n\nThe Defense Ministry provided no concrete evidence to demonstrate a direct connection between the organizations and the PFLP in its announcement on Friday.\n\nThe list consisted of: Union of Palestinian Women’s Committees; ADDAMEER — Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association; Bisan Center for Research and Development; al-Haq Organization; Defense for Children International — Palestine (DCI-P); and the Union Of Agricultural Work Committees.\n\nGantz’s move sparked a swift backlash around the globe, with the EU, the Palestinian Authority, progressive Democrats, US Jewish groups, and international and Israeli human rights organizations expressing criticism.\n\nBoth Israeli military and civilian law ban supporting or joining a terror group, and violators can face years in prison. Israeli authorities can also seize assets belonging to terror organizations and prohibit funding their activities. Donors may also be subject to significant jail time.\n\nIsraeli authorities have charged before that the PFLP has pilfered millions of euros from civil society organizations affiliated with its members to fund terrorist activities.", "timestamp": 1635156138, "digest": "tvuiO5SaH2ENEm2bLVvaqs4Aopn9_gIOR9P-M9qOKcw", "contributor": "0xd4136e6E66561B194a8F4E5cA62A707095B64721"}

新媒介环境的潜在危机——社群同质化；立场部落化**\n在传统媒体时代，“媒体对于个体想什么或者怎么想具有重大的作用”。在新媒介背景下，这一法则转化为：“由多元个体组成的社群通过互联网等新媒介对于人们想什么或者怎么想具有重要作用”。\n新媒介环境下，过去“媒体”的传播作用逐渐转向“社群”：公共媒体的一部分正在逐渐被社交媒体取代。拥有怎样的的价值观、兴趣爱好；从事怎样的事业与专业，决定了你的社会环境，或者一定程度上决定了你的「朋友圈」及「特别关注」。兴趣、价值观、信息来源及认知水平相似的社群筛选并酝酿相同的新闻品味和立场——这就造成了社群的信息同质化、封闭化与部落化。社交立场逐渐取代真相。\n\n**3 新闻“商品化”，搜索引擎的“用户至上”——算法推荐系统如何加剧偏见**\n正如“选择怎样的媒体，决定你看到怎样的世界”。算法推荐系统通过记录浏览信息，并根据此分析预测个人喜好，为人们推荐“信息”这一商品，这是当今绝大多数搜索引擎及部分新媒体面向用户的策略——对群众喜好的迎合，通过智能推荐算法、人口统计学预测并提供给我们那些我们会感兴趣，并有倾向去相信的信息——无论其真实与否，是否公正。\n过去的公众媒体，由于各方专业记者的专业素养，在事实的陈述方面尚能一致。如今，私人定制的“智能”媒体，正在通过比社群同化更直接、精确、谄媚的方式，决定了我们更可能看到「哪些新闻」与「哪种论调」。此时我们每个人面对的，甚至可能是同一件事的「不同版本」，并且每个人都「信自己为真」。\n\n**4 我们该怎么做？以什么方式面对复杂信息？**\n如今经常有新闻反转的普遍现象。由于新闻在信息收集、加工、分发和传播等新闻生产的每个环节中，都可能存在报道失实与相关偏见混入的情况，大家应该以什么样的态度去面对复杂信息呢？这里笔者借用课程讨论中的结论给出建议：\n**收到一条信息的时候，首先思考：**\n1 信息的发布者是谁？\n2 他出于什么目的发表了这条信息？\n3 言论是否公正？推论是否合理？\n4 是否有足够事实证据？数据的来源是否科学？\n**然后怎么做？**\n1 识别【物理叙述性事实】和【分析性事实】。\n2 跳出惯用媒体来源，寻求不同的信息来源，对比分析对同一件事实的阐述与报道。\n3 结合自己的逻辑分析能力、专业知识，分析何为公正、何为偏颇，形成自己的立场。\n\n—————————————————————————\n现在，我们通过对同一事件的多方引述来看看这个问题\n「Google搜索结果是否存在政治偏见？\"」\n—————————————————————————\n**材料1 “极不可信”的数据，大有作为**\n涉及人物：“极不可信”的数据作者  Bolyard；特朗普\n来源：路透社\n8月，保守派媒体PJ传媒（PJ Media）的监督编辑Paula Bolyard发表了一篇报道，报道说谷歌在对唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）搜索结果中，96%的“出自左倾的言论和反特朗普”被放在了优先位置。\n她在Google的新闻标签中搜索“Trump”，然后使用一个“极不可信”的统计媒体图表，将网站分为“左”和“右”来列出搜索结果。她报告说，100个调查结果中有96个来自所谓的“左倾”新闻机构，其中21个来自CNN。尽管她认为自己的方法并不科学，但数据结果仍广为流传。\n由于技术公司对其内容算法保密，因此无法从外部明确证明算法存在反保守的偏见。在缺乏证据的情况下，像PJ媒体、《布莱特巴特》、《每日电讯报》和《华盛顿审查报》等超党派的新闻媒体突出报道了硅谷“敌视”保守派的故事。仅从这些案例中，即可推断出硅谷正通过不同公司间的技术联合镇压抵制保守党。\n几天后，唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）在推特上说，谷歌的结果对他不利，他引用了Bolyard的数据。特朗普利用这一统计数字来证实这样的猜测，即科技公司正在将反保守的偏见编码到自己的业务架构中。“谷歌和其他公司正在压制保守党的声音，并隐藏好消息和新闻。”\n有趣的事是，他通过引用Bolyard的轶事数据作为可靠的证据，无意识地揭示了反保守偏见的说法是如何作为阴谋论而非可证实的事实通过媒体传播的。\n\n**材料2 来自自由电影人的暗示**\n来源：路透社\n涉及人物：提出“搜索引擎操纵效应”心理学家 Epstein；纪录片导演Taylor\n今年由导演Taylor和前布莱特巴特编辑Peter Schweizer发行的纪录片《令人毛骨悚然》对这一论点进行了广泛的探讨。这部电影基于心理学家 Robert Epstein的研究。自2013年以来，他发表了一系列研究报告，证明搜索引擎如何通过排序和过滤搜索结果来操纵政治观点，并称之为“搜索引擎操纵效应”。\n虽然Robert Epstein,提出，这种影响理论上可以用于任何政治议程，但整个电影中贯穿着潜台词的暗示——暗示这种操纵被明确地用于支持民主党和自由事业。\n影片的叙述者彼得·施韦泽（Peter Schweizer）发表了挑衅性的言论，在其描述谷歌和Facebook如何操纵选举，支持一位候选人时，奥巴马和马克·扎克伯格以及埃里克·施密特的合影，及关于大型科技公司反保守党偏见的新闻头条在屏幕上闪过。他认为“这些公司的议程远比他们透露的要深远”，或是“政府试图引导我们走向乌托邦”。\n这种想法贯穿整个纪录片，将谷歌和Facebook描绘成反对保守思想的自由筒仓。电影导演泰勒认为：“公司的政治倾向通常并不重要。”“但是，当你控制着信息的起伏，并具有政治倾向，决定某些信息是否应该存在，那就是偏见开始进入谈话的时候。”\n\n**材料3 算法背后——不完美的系统本身创造偏见？**\n涉及人物：谷歌，Facebook和Twitter技术执行官\n来源：Facebook；Twitter；Pinterest\n虽然反对保守主义偏见的叙述来自这些右倾媒体来源，但它开始在更多主流观众中占据主导地位。在过去的一年里，一些共和党政治家公开质疑社交媒体平台是否偏袒他们的算法来歧视保守派。 社会学教授弗朗西斯卡认为，反保守偏见的轶事证据通过媒体传播为事实，部分原因在于对搜索引擎和内容审核实践中的偏见如何运作存在深刻的误解。 “这些算法非常复杂”：它会衡量许多因素。「事实上，Google已同时用了数百种不同的算法来确定最终显示给用户的搜索结果顺序。top3: 搜索内容与标题关键词的相关度；网站之间的链接性。RankBrain：搜索用户对于搜索结果的满意度——建立权重模型，以点击率和停留时间等权重因子衡量满意度。」\n\nTripodi解释说，如果你搜索唐纳德特朗普并获得大多数负面结果，那不是因为谷歌高管正在审查支持特朗普的声音，而是因为大多数谷歌用户正在寻找或愿意链接到这种特定类型的新闻。 “换句话说，谷歌有偏见，但它的偏见倾向于人们希望看到的结果类型。搜索结果有点像关于什么新闻重要的民意调查。该公司依赖于智能推荐，如果他们不这样做，用户就不会继续使用他们的服务。 “我们要意识到的是，这些系统不是中性的，往往会放大偏见，”Tripodi说。 “但这会影响我们所有人。”事实上，错误的内容审核实践已经影响了许多的进步。与Black Lives Matter相关的活动家由于呼吁种族主义已经被平台禁用，而LGBT活动家的有关同性婚姻的视频也被YouTube过滤。 谷歌，Facebook和其他大型科技公司在应对被指控持有反对保守的偏见和审查时提出了类似的解释，并承认正在努力研究——如何去调整和过滤如此大量的内容”。“这个问题的一个重要部分是这些过程不透明，”Tripodi说。 “也许如果我们更多地了解为什么内容被提升，删除，标记或取消，那么所有这些适得其反的猜想都会有更少的空间。” 在缺乏透明度的情况下，硅谷反保守偏见的观念仍然茁壮成长：今年9月，亚历克斯·琼斯（Alex Jones）在国会听证会上揭幕，共和党人质疑技术高管杰克·多尔西（Jack Dorsey）和谢丽尔·桑德伯格（Sheryl Sandberg）关于他们平台的政治偏见。琼斯抗议他最近因为传播仇恨言论而被YouTube和Facebook禁言。\n\n**材料4阴谋理论家施压社交媒体公司**\n涉及人物：阴谋理论家琼斯及极右派；社交媒体公司\n来源：Facebook；推特；Pinterest\n电台主持人和阴谋理论家琼斯在参议院委员会听证会上与Twitter和Facebook高管谈话时向媒体发表讲话。正如丹娜·博伊德在在线新闻协会会议上的演讲中所解释的那样，琼斯的仇恨言论并不构成保守价值观。但是他玩世不恭地操纵着反保守主义偏见的叙述，在“保守主义的虚假旗帜下”赋予他存在的合法性。“这是用名义上的保守主义作为斗篷，以促进有害的男性和白人主义至上。”从根本上说，这是一种通过向公众施放毒气并使现实看起来模糊来获取权力的技术。\n其他极右派也采用了同样的策略，他们也通过恳求唐纳德·特朗普“拯救”保守派免受社会媒体审查而打断了诉讼程序。不管怎样，这个策略似乎奏效了。社交媒体公司对于禁止用户变得更加犹豫，他们因为害怕被描绘成审查员而公然违反他们的服务条款。而自称“另类”的社交媒体平台，如Gab，也开始出现，它们自诩为言论自由的堡垒和保守派的避风港，实际上却充当仇恨言论的滋生地。\n\n**材料5来自教授的质询—— “压抑算法”与民主进程**\n涉及人物：传播新闻学院教授Safiya U Nobl\n来源：Facebook；推特；Pinterest\n最后，与Bolyard和Taylor谈话时，他们都声称他们最关心算法偏见如何破坏民主进程的稳定。 “无论你是谁，或者你如何在政治上倾斜，或者你是什么性别，有一天算法平台都可以将你扫地出门——这对社会不利。与此同时，根据南加州大学安纳伯格传播与新闻学院的教授Safiya U Noble的说法，那些在没有充分证据的情况下传播反保守党偏见的叙述的人，应明白他们的观点应考虑真实的政治环境。 “我认为这是一个微妙的问题：鉴于现代民主国家中保守派和右翼政治力量的崛起，保守派偏见的主张并未成立。”\nNoble在她的“压抑算法”（Algorithms of Oppression）一书中提出，虽然所有的算法系统都嵌入了预先存在的社会偏见，但这些偏见增强了权力，从而对付那些被系统剥夺权利的人。例如，她通过谷歌搜索“黑人女孩”，页面展示出过多的色情结果。\n正如Noble所解释的那样，未经证实的反保守偏见的呼声会通过转移这些“压抑算法”对真实世界造成更为严重的影响。 “我们必须理解这些保守偏见概念中的价值，”诺布尔说，“并且理解这只不过是一个红色的鲱鱼。”（hot hiring 俚语：指微不足道、混淆视听的东西——从而引诱你在真正重要的问题上作出让步 ）\n\n5 结语：我们正在期待怎样的「好媒体」？我们怎样拥有「更好的社会」？\n当今社会，新闻的作用已经远远超出了“让大众知情”这一基本功能。行业中已经出现了不同形式的、迎合不同受众口味的新闻形式。结合上文所述，尽管人的心智缺陷与流行的「压抑算法」在不断强化受众的新闻偏见，尽管克服自己的已有偏见、周遭媒体不断强化的对他人的刻板印象并非易事，但信息的透明性与其越来越强的流通性同时也具有强大的力量去打破不同社交媒体部落间的藩篱。\n\n在即将到来的时代里，我们拥有一个前所未有的机会去创造一个传播系统，它具有强大的力量推动社会的平等、人性化、可持续性和创造力，公正和自治是该时代的秩序。\n——罗伯特 W. 麦克切斯尼在《传播革命》\n\n那么，我们究竟怎样拥有这个「平等、公正、自治、创新、人性化与可持续的好社会」呢？对于结语的问题，笔者先抛砖引玉，仅仅代表Qian的价值观与立场：\n\n1. 个人层面：不是强化偏见，而是打破偏见。跨界交流，保持质疑。\n2. 企业层面：价值观与行业道德建设。担负起公众声音的责任。\n   公共媒体更应承担引导、教育、启发的功能。质疑基于经验主义的智能算法应用于此领域的合理性，算法“迎合用户”——短视的商业利益至上的价值观，导致基于经验、偏好的连接，进一步加强认知偏见与真相隔离。\n3. 第三方机构监督：创建非盈利组织，如多方新闻观点平台（Allsides）于相关问题展开理性讨论；网络平台对既存偏见算法的清洗：如黑人女孩与「色情」的强联系算法\n4. 创新新闻格式：既然在当今社会，新闻的作用已经远远超出了“让大众知情”这一基本功能，不妨将超出的内容“规范化”，展现事件更完整的样貌，如解困新闻学：\n   解困新闻学 (Solutions Journalism) 往往针对深刻的社会问题进行报道，但并不拘泥于刻画问题本身的严重性，而更专注于社会、机构、人群对社会问题的解决过程。他们着力报道成功案例背后的原因与机制，和不成功案例背后的挑战与改良途径。这样的报道聚焦在人们为解决社会问题而做出的努力，并通过更加全面的报道，启发民智并持续推动问题的解决。\n   我们正在期待怎样的「好媒体」？我们怎样拥有「更好的社会」？\n\n参考网站：\n\n**Media

{"id": "27IVkxWV5W1H-EN-bFCMZypJLK4OuuYPNegXAwHFIcY", "title": "AirPods 3: Apple's 2021 wireless headphones are missing a few big features", "body": "[Apple's third-gen AirPods](https://www.cnet.com/news/airpods-3-unveiled-apple-new-2021-earbuds-look-a-lot-like-the-airpods-pro/) were a highlight of Apple's October \"Unleashed\" event, which also saw the debut of a [redesigned MacBook Pro line](https://www.cnet.com/news/6000-dollar-macbook-pro-is-a-real-thing-you-can-buy-now/) that brings back multiple ports and higher-end [M1 Pro and M1 Max chips](https://www.cnet.com/news/m1-pro-m1-max-apple-silicon-kicking-intel-out-of-the-mac-computer/). The $179 (£169, AU$279) AirPods 3 aims for the middle ground between the [$129 second-gen AirPods](https://www.cnet.com/reviews/apple-airpods-2019-review/), which will remain for sale, and the [$249 AirPods Pro](https://www.cnet.com/reviews/apple-airpods-pro-review/). It includes [Spatial Audio](https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/what-is-spatial-audio-everything-you-need-to-know-about-apples-sound-format/) support with head tracking, sweat- and water-resistance, a [MagSafe-compatible wireless charging case](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/best-magsafe-and-magnetic-wireless-chargers-for-apple-iphone-13-and-iphone-12/) and a six-hour battery life that outranks previous generations and the AirPods Pro.\n\nYet $179 is still a lot of money for wireless headphones, and when you look outside of Apple you can easily find headphones with comparable features -- often for less money. While Apple's AirPods connect seamlessly to Apple devices, you may want to consider alternatives if you're splitting your headphone time between an iPhone and a non-Apple device such as a Windows PC or a Nintendo Switch. Other manufacturers can give you better support for those devices.\n\nGet to know Apple's new AirPods\n\n09:53\n\nLarge play-pause toggle00:0009:53\n\nLet's highlight some features you should keep in mind when trying to decide if you should buy the new AirPods 3.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\n* [Apple event recap: AirPods 3, new MacBook Pro and more](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/everything-announced-at-the-apple-event-airpods-3-new-macbook-pro-homepod-mini-and-more/)\n* [Apple unveils new AirPods at $179](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/airpods-3-unveiled-apple-new-2021-earbuds-look-a-lot-like-the-airpods-pro/)\n* [Apple's MacBook Pro display features a new notch, faster refresh rate](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/apples-macbook-pro-display-features-a-notch-faster-refresh-rate/)\n\n## Colors\n\nThe third-gen AirPods come in one color: white. It's the same color that the second-gen AirPods and the AirPods Pro come in, but Apple lately has been pushing color throughout its product line. The [$549 AirPods Max](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-airpods-max-review-top-notch-sound-noise-canceling-and-a-hefty-price-tag/) comes in five colors (space gray, silver, pink, green and sky blue), and the [2021 iMac](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/apple-24-inch-imac-review-a-colorful-new-m1-mac-for-the-post-quarantine-world/) line comes in seven colors depending on the version you want.\n\nApple made a big deal of releasing the [iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini in purple](https://www.cnet.com/pictures/iphone-12s-new-purple-color-is-pastel-perfection/) in the spring, and its [Beats Studio Buds](https://www.cnet.com/news/beats-studio-buds-review-better-sound-than-airpods-pro/) come in black, white and red.\n\nCNET MOBILE\n\nDiscover the latest news and best reviews in smartphones and carriers from CNET's mobile experts.\n\nSIGN ME UP!\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our [Terms of Use](https://redventures.com/CMG-terms-of-use.html) and acknowledge the data practices in our [Privacy Policy](https://redventures.com/privacy-policy.html). You may unsubscribe at any time.\n\nAs a result it's a little strange that Apple isn't following suit with its 2021 wireless headphones. Meanwhile if color is particularly important to you, Samsung's various Galaxy Buds headphones seem to come in almost every color. Depending on the model, you can find them in shades of red, blue, purple, green, gray, black and white.\n\nThat said, it's likely that this generation of AirPods will spend years on the market, and perhaps Apple could later offer them in shades like the iPhone 13's pink, blue, midnight and Product Red.\n\n![p1000365](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/70wlPzh8Jw8fCfglCzfhCdXttvo=/2021/06/24/9324ef3c-290f-4a1d-9211-caa56a925608/p1000365.jpg?size=large pull-none hasCaption shortcode)\n\n## Lower price\n\nWhile $179 is cheaper than the AirPods Pro, it's actually more expensive than the $159 starting price of the second-gen AirPods. While that latter headphone has been knocked down to $129 and still includes core features like seamless pairing to Apple devices, the $50 difference throws in many technical improvements to the listening experience as well as the magnetic charging case.\n\nHowever it's when you look outside of Apple's headphone realm that $179 starts to feel expensive for what these features bring. The $130 [Anker Liberty Air 2 Pro](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/anker-liberty-air-2-pro-review-a-good-airpods-pro-alternative-for-less/) includes many of the AirPods Pro's highlight features, such as active noise canceling, transparency modes, water-resistance and a wireless charging case. Ditto for the [Samsung Galaxy Buds 2](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review/), which costs $150.\n\nWhen Apple first launched the AirPods back in 2017, it kickstarted a huge wireless headphone market, but that market is now filled with comparable competition. Apple can maintain a variety of exclusive software enhancements like fast pairing to Apple devices and head-tracking enhancements to Spatial Audio, but few of these features should be enough to stop you from considering a cheaper alternative.\n\n![anker-soundcore-liberty-air-2-1](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/SE3mA6BxUYIj2APsIyHLqMx-L7Y=/2021/01/12/97d686b3-42a7-430d-b3f9-1c2c3533ae44/anker-soundcore-liberty-air-2-1.jpg?size=large pull-none hasCaption shortcode)\n\n## Multipoint Bluetooth connections to non-Apple devices\n\nThe AirPods line does let you seamlessly switch between an iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, MacBook and nearly any other Apple device. But throw in a Windows PC or a Nintendo Switch, and suddenly you are back to navigating Bluetooth menus. Headphones that support multipoint Bluetooth pairing alleviate that, generally by always pairing to two (or more) devices at the same time, regardless of manufacturer.\n\nI recently bought the [Wyze headphones](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/wyze-headphones-hands-on-sweet-features-and-impressive-anc-for-just-50/) for around $60, following a recommendation from CNET's Cheapskate Emeritus Rick Broida, and it made me realize that this feature was way more useful than I'd previously assumed. When I'm at work, my headphones are usually connected to a MacBook Pro, but when a call comes in, my computer's music pauses while the headphones swap to the phone. Then after the call, it switches back to the computer. Then once I'm back home, I can sync my headphones to the [Lenovo Chromebook Duet](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-best-small-2-in-1-chromebook-around/) or any other device. \n\nThe [Jabra Elite 75t wireless headphones](https://www.cnet.com/products/jabra-elite-75t/), which can usually be found for around $150, include this feature. You'll want it if you expect to jump between multiple devices. Otherwise, multipoint Bluetooth is more common in over-ear headphones such as the aforementioned Wyze up through the higher-end [Sony WH-1000XM4](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/sony-wh-1000xm4-review-a-nearly-flawless-noise-canceling-headphone/) (it lists for $350 but sometimes gets a price drop by $100 to around $250). The Sony headphones were called \"nearly flawless\" by CNET Executive Editor David Carnoy, but if you're shopping in the $250 range, you may be better off comparing them to the AirPods Pro than the new AirPods.\n\n![12-jabra-elite-75t](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/7y1zO3FUkbESQPt4j6mmMstbtFo=/2020/12/16/f058ab3f-c453-4442-a0b7-852c7d2b9da5/12-jabra-elite-75t.jpg?size=large pull-none hasCaption shortcode)\n\n*What do you think about the third-gen AirPods?

During this research in Greenland, which contains the oldest known deposits of rubies in the world, the team found a ruby sample that contained graphite, a mineral made of pure carbon. Analysis of this carbon indicates that it is a remnant of early life.\n\n“The graphite inside this ruby is really unique. It’s the first time we’ve seen evidence of ancient life in ruby-bearing rocks,” says Yakymchuk. “The presence of graphite also gives us more clues to determine how rubies formed at this location, something that is impossible to do directly based on a ruby’s color and chemical composition.”\n\nThe presence of the graphite allowed the researchers to analyze a property called isotopic composition of the carbon atoms, which measures the relative amounts of different carbon atoms. More than 98 percent of all carbon atoms have a mass of 12 atomic mass units, but a few carbon atoms are heavier, with a mass of 13 or 14 atomic mass units.\n\n“Living matter preferentially consists of the lighter carbon atoms because they take less energy to incorporate into cells,” said Yakymchuk. “Based on the increased amount of carbon-12 in this graphite, we concluded that the carbon atoms were once ancient life, most likely dead microorganisms such as cyanobacteria.”\n\nThe graphite is found in rocks older than 2.5 billion years ago, a time on the planet when oxygen was not abundant in the atmosphere, and life existed only in microorganisms and algae films.\n\nDuring this study, Yakymchuk’s team discovered that this graphite not only links the gemstone to ancient life but was also likely necessary for this ruby to exist at all. The graphite changed the chemistry of the surrounding rocks to create favorable conditions for ruby growth. Without it, the team’s models showed that it would not have been possible to form rubies in this location.\n\nThe study, “Corundum (ruby) growth during the final assembly of the Archean North Atlantic Craton, southern West Greenland,” was recently published in *Ore Geology Reviews*. A companion study, “The corundum conundrum: Constraining the compositions of fluids involved in ruby formation in metamorphic melanges of ultramafic and aluminous rocks,” was published in the journal *Chemical Geology* in June.\n\nReferences:\n\n“Corundum (ruby) growth during the final assembly of the Archean North Atlantic Craton, southern West Greenland” by Chris Yakymchuk, Vincent van Hinsberg, Christopher L.

We did all vintage and upcycled my old stuff,\" Jolie said of her and the kids' red carpet looks.\n\nAs for what her [kids thought of the movie](https://www.etonline.com/angelina-jolie-and-salma-hayek-share-what-their-kids-thought-of-eternals-exclusive-174141), Jolie said, \"Honestly they all loved it\" while Hayek added that her daughter \"thinks it's the best superhero movie she's ever seen.\"\n\nJolie explained that this was a rare film in which she really felt that her family, which includes adopted children from different parts of the world, was represented.\n\n\"What I've learned within my family is that we are stronger because we are a diverse family,\" she said. \"That is what makes our family and what we've learned from each other, and I wouldn't want it any other way and I so I'm so happy that people around the world will watch this film and I'm hoping this is just the new norm.\"\n\nFor more on *Eternals*, watch the video below.\n\n**RELATED CONTENT**\n\n[Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek on What Their Kids Thought of 'Eternals'](https://www.etonline.com/angelina-jolie-and-salma-hayek-share-what-their-kids-thought-of-eternals-exclusive-174141)\n\n['Eternals' Stars Skip Elle's Women in Hollywood After COVID Exposure](https://www.etonline.com/eternals-stars-angelina-jolie-and-salma-hayek-exposed-to-covid-19-skip-women-in-hollywood-event)\n\n[Angelina Jolie Reacts to Daughter Zahara Wearing Her 2014 Oscars Dress](https://www.etonline.com/angelina-jolie-reacts-to-daughter-zahara-wearing-her-2014-oscars-dress-to-eternals-premiere-173920)", "timestamp": 1635157219, "digest": "IQkLECaiJbNZdQauOwr8PMhMGWXMmRPf8kQG3WXZJIw", "contributor": "0x9fEBE8Fef2023A1471822697F2EE016e30D61953"}
{"id": "C2cjFLbrtugsftqcqevPrCBrlw-mxI_hkVAywyiHktM", "title": "Solv Protocol ：新NFT标准能做什么？", "body": "### 背景知识：NFT底层协议标准说明\n\n<https://news.huoxing24.com/20210519093616169864.html>\n\n**与ERC20协议相似的，NFT有三种底层协议标准——ERC-721，ERC-1155，ERC-998。**\n\n**1、ERC-20**：即FT；其主要优势在于可计算，但是缺乏描述能力，如果想要描述100类token，必须要编写100个不同的ERC20合约，发布100种不同的ERC20 tokens。每个token仅有数量属性。\n\n**2、ERC-721：每个NFT都是独一无二、没有同类、不可拆分。——不可计算**\n\n描述能力强，可以通过创建一个ERC721合约，然后铸造100个不同的NFT，每个NFT/token都有一个Token ID。案例：加密猫\n\n**3、ERC-1155：**\n\n描述能力强，可以通过创建一个ERC1155合约，然后铸造100个不同的Token ID，每个ID都是一个类别，**一个类别中的token没有任何区别，有数量属性。**这里的ID和ERC721对比来看的区别是：ID不再是某个物品，**而是一个类别。**\n\n案例：游戏中的一类道具：ERC1155可以满足不同场景下的灵活需求，比如同时转账多数量的多类别资产，也可以转账多数量的同一类别资产，大大提高了转账的快捷方便程度。\n\n**4、ERC-998：**可组合非同质化代币（Composable NFTs,缩写为CNFT）。它的结构设计是一个标准化延伸**可以让任何一个NFT可以拥有其他NFT或FT**。**转移CNFT时，就是转移CNFT所拥有的整个层级结构和所属关系。**简单来说就是ERC-998可以包含多个ERC-721和ERC-20形式的代币。具体方式是通过父tokenID映射到子token合约地址，当子token是NFT/FT时，子合约地址映射到对应的子tokenID/余额。\n\n**5、可拆分NFT（Fractional NFT**）——不在资产底层协议标准层面\n\n**有另外一种分割NFT的方法，即对于不可分割的NFT，对其所有权进行分割**；**Fractional 协议** 使 **NFT** 所有者能够对自己的作品进行所有权分割，分割后的代币可以作为正常的 **ERC-20** 进行使用，从而实现百分比买卖。\n\n**6、为NFT-721增加“数量”属性的vNFT、通过 SLOT机制为token ID进行分类**\n\n![vNFT在整个token协议分类中的位置](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/efMQC_U-aLx35SrpfA8nQ.png?height=738&width=1080)\n\n![vNFT的数据结构](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hMRVib_BqUSPbeQVDTRbM.jpg?height=599&width=2079)\n\n**vNFT——兼容ERC-721**\n\n1、数量   2、SLOT作为NFT的抽象和归类机制  3、定义了 ERC-721 的扩展，与ERC-721兼容，支持灵活的拆分。\n\n一个SLOT代表一个类别，圈定了一组特定的属性，如果任何两个vNFT，都具有这一组属性，且这一组属性都一模一样，那就可以被归为这个SLOT所代表的类别中。被归为一类的vNFT就可以进行数量的加减。\n\n本项目的vNFT 标准已提交EIP-3525，并已于2021/10/20被以太坊正式收录：<https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/3641>\n\n### 业务模型\n\n**什么是Vouchers？**\n\nSolv Vouchers 是 Voucher 的铸造、管理和交易的 DeFi 平台，为项目方提供更便捷、灵活、低成本的锁仓 Token 管理工具。Voucher是一种装有锁仓Token的NFT，可根据预先设定的模式自动释放Token。可以简单理解为SAFT协议的NFT化。\n\n**为什么要铸造Vouchers？**\n\n大部分项目选择将Vesting Tokens直接存入自己编写的智能合约中，这种模式让锁仓额度彻底被“锁死”。Solv Vouchers 帮助项目方灵活的编程NFT，用来代表锁仓额度，从而让锁仓额度的流动性被彻底释放。\n\n**Vouchers具体可以用来做什么？**\n\n**1、额度管理：大幅下降锁仓额度的管理成本**\n\n当项目将锁仓 Token 份额分发给投资人与用户时，需要付出不菲的管理成本，包括 SAFT 协议的签署、按规定承兑 Token，协助持有者转移所有权等。\n\n项目方可以将应该锁仓的 Token 存入智能合约，设置好相应的锁仓期限和解锁方式，便可铸造出代表着该项目锁仓额度的 Voucher。\n\nVoucher 将严格按照铸造时所设定的模式自动释放 Token，为项目方免去了复杂的 SAFT 协议签署以及相关智能合约开发与部署等额外成本。\n\n**Solv Vouchers 支持多种 Token 锁仓方式与操作**\n\nSolv Vouchers 支持线性、单点、阶段、预言机驱动等多种锁仓方式，以及灵活的锁仓时间设定。在释放过程中，Voucher 持有人还可以进行提取、转让、拆分、合并等操作。\n\n对项目方来说，通过铸造 Voucher 来管理额度，是一种更便捷、灵活且低成本的方式。Solv Vouchers 让管理成千上万个额度持有者成为可能。\n\n**2、额度交易：让额度的流转交易更高效——Solv Vouchers Marketplace和支持ERC-721的NFT交易平台**\n\n锁仓Token的交易往往发生在OTC市场，一个充满欺诈、不透明、低效率的市场。这让额度的流动变得尤其困难。通过将锁仓额度通证化，我们将构建一个高透明、低欺诈、无交易对手方风险的链上额度交易市场，让额度持有者以更高效的方式获得流动性。\n\n**Solv Vouchers Marketplace支持全新的碎片化购买**\n\n因vNFT标准下的Voucher本身支持灵活的拆分功能，因此人们可以在内置交易平台 Solv Vouchers Marketplace 进行碎片化购买，即一次性仅购买一部分锁仓 Token。大幅度降低锁仓额度交易的摩擦，促使交易的发生。\n\nVoucher 采用的通证标准 vNFT 与ERC-721兼容，因此 Voucher 可以被所有支持 ERC-721 的交易平台天然支持，比如 **Opensea** 支持 Voucher 的多种交易模式，并支持查询链上 Voucher。\n\n**3、Voucher 借贷：通过借贷释放Voucher流动性**\n\n在传统股权市场中，股票质押是股东获取流动性的一个重要方式，DeFi项目的核心成员往往都具有大量锁仓Token。借贷服务将为锁仓Token持有者提供全新的流动性来源。\n\n相比艺术品或收藏品类 NFT，Voucher 是一种更偏向金融场景的NFT资产，在清算、评估价格等方面更适配借贷金融服务。NFTfi等支持ERC721借贷的协议将天然支持Voucher，同时Aave等借贷领先者也已进入这一领域。\n\n**4、 Repo回购市场**\n\n 通过将正在流通的 Token 铸造为 Voucher，项目方可以用再回购协议的形式建立流动性管理机制，以一种更为灵活和有效的方式来管理 Token 流通量价格。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oa4NTlMbABg2DLrcKQ7EZ.png?height=379&width=1745)\n\n### 经济模型\n\n较为均衡，且解锁日均在IDO 60天后。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LzkcM0KgyjPv1rNeWXGyM.png?height=1072&width=2170)\n\n\\*TGE：是指$SOLV的 IDO日期。\n\n\\*\\*Cliff days：从IDO日算起，60天后开始进行释放。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oY_3oY0z403DurTAZ0oAh.png?height=1098&width=2270)\n\n### 收入来源\n\nSolv Marketplace的手续费收入；\n\n持有solv拥有打新资格，以及相关生态治理权（在设计中）\n\n### 特色与优势\n\n1、项目提出了新的NFT标准3525，这个标准是一个适合Financial NFT的token标准，它与ERC-721兼容，并同时支持灵活的拆分。此标准目前已提交EIP，<https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/3641>\n\n2、基于这一技术基础，力图打造DeFi NFT的基础设施、生产工厂和交易市场。全面优化过去的匀质、缺乏个性化、较为粗放的DeFi产品生态。事实证明：Uniswap v3的成功，预示着DeFi会进一步向以vNFT为特点的非匀质资产方向转型。\n\n3、额度发行、管理与交易平台 Solv Vouchers 是 Solv 团队基于 VNFT 开发的第一个 DeFi 应用。其中Allocation market是solv vouchers下的第一个市场，之后会有一个和份额市场平级的回购市场。目前Allocation market已与 DODO、Parsiq、Bounce、NAOS Finance、Ankr、Saffron Finance、Impossible Finance 等多个项目建立战略合作关系。锁仓金额已经达到千万美金。\n\n潜在问题：\n\n1、问题：目前市场转熊，大部分合作项目方价格下跌，导致原有面向散户的份额交易市场失去活力。目前业务重心放在额度管理市场\n\n2、后续solv代币的经济模型/生态流转模式需要持续跟踪\n\n3、社区目前处于培育阶段；目前对行业热点的追随力度较弱\n\n### 路线图\n\n**2021 Q1**\n\n3\\.9 DeFi 协议 Solv Markets 完成百万美元种子轮融资：<https://www.chainnews.com/news/544743321073.htm>\n\n在Rinkeyby测试网上线，取得500+社区好评\n\n**2021 Q2**\n\nSolv Voucher Marketplace上线\n\nSolv Vouncher 在主网上线\n\nDoDo Vouncher （10万枚，半价销售）在market上发行\n\n**2021 Q3**\n\n团购模式发行\n\n回购市场模型上线\n\n在Layer2上发行\n\n**2021 Q4**\n\n联合流动性挖矿、铸造和交易模型\n\n接受艺术收藏品\n\n开启分期付款模式\n\n**2022 Q1&Q2**\n\n在Solana网络上发行\n\n开放无许可的金融NFT的铸造和交易系统\n\n**运营进展和数据表现**\n\n已有合作方：由于 Vouchers能帮助额度的持有者更便捷地交易额度、也可以通过借贷为这类资产提供流动性，目前的市场情况下，很多项目方表示愿意来铸造自己的Voucher对额度进行管理，而非去市场上向散户销售。现有铸造Voucher的合作方有： Dodo、Bounce、Saffron、Naos Finance、Impossible Finance、Ankr、Wootrade、Bella、ANKR、Highstreet、Strips等数十个项目均采用了SOLV铸造方案，TVL已经超过1千万美金。\n\n潜在市场规模：Vouchers在当前的DeFi市场中潜在TVL（所有项目锁仓额度的总和）预计达到数百亿美金。\n\n**投资机构及团队**\n\n第一轮融资由 IOSG Ventures、Axia8 Ventures 及 Spartan Group 联合领投，Hashed、Krypital Group 、GBV、Maple Leaf Capital 参投。\n\n第二轮即将close，有Divergence Venture、CMSholdings等。", "timestamp": 1635157814, "digest": "LfJCop0YIDBvlzunmiZJ4pL4s1jYFPkbS9shuee2l1g",

{"id": "NDT4sZ0BkkXLDYqNpVXQykzEvpPoqSSsqF7p5oQ68qw", "title": "Reflexer：非锚定抵押稳定币", "body": "2021/10/1\n\nReflexer Labs提出创建一种新型稳定币RAI，该代币是通过将ETH作为抵押品存入【SAFE】中铸造发行的。如果SAFE的余额不能维持145%的抵押率，该头寸将面临清算风险，抵押品将被拍卖用于偿还债务。发行方式与核心组件配备和稳定币DAI类似**，**不同点在于：\n\n1、**非锚定型稳定币。RAI不与美元保持挂钩，**即目标价格1RAI≠1美元**，**甚至不与任何事物保持锚定，而是自动对市场力量做出反应，调整原生抵押资产的目标价格，从而达到价格稳定的效果；RAI也可以看做是一种降低或延迟资产波动性的方案，提供低波动性资产作为基础标的资产。\n\n2、尽量移除治理中的人为因素，**实现治理最小化，降低治理成本。**\n\n3、RAI 讲 ETH 作为**唯一的抵押品形式**，可以看做单一抵押 DAI （SCD），不同于 MakerDAO 的多抵押 Dai （MCD）。\n\n### 业务模型\n\n在稳定币借贷系统中，对于用户来说，完成一笔稳定币RAI的借贷交易操作是【存入】、【借出】、【偿还】。两个问题:1 如何维持稳定币的价格锚定; 2 如何确保借款得以清偿。\n\n**1、存款：**用户通过将 ETH 存入 SAFE （类似于 Maker's vaults），铸造 RAI 。（抵押率为145%）\n\n用户通过偿还 RAI，并付上借款费用（利率目前为2.42%），来赎回他们的抵押品。如果用户仍有债务未偿还，且其抵押品比例降至一定阈值以下，其抵押品将被清算。RAI 的代币 FLX 用于管理和支持该系统。\n\n**2、价格稳定机制**\n\n首先，RAI 没有与美元挂钩，而是与自身挂钩。它一开始有一个任意的目标价格（称为赎回价格，为3.14美元），它通过调整目标价格来影响 RAI 的市场价格。与Dai不同，没有任何挂钩的法币，因此可以对 RAI 进行贬值以影响其市场价格。\n\n其运作方式是，当 RAI 的市场价格远离其赎回价格时，协议自动调整赎回价格，按比例抗衡价格变动以稳定 RAI。**本质上，该系统根据赎回率（RAI 贬值或重估的比率）对 RAI 进行贬值或重估，以激励人们借款或还债。**\n\nRAI的**初始目标价格**（赎回价格）是任意设定的（发行时初始目标价格为3.14美元），但是在市场行情作用下，RAI的市场价格可能会慢慢与赎回价格发生偏离，为了防止二者之间偏差过大，RAI引入了**【赎回率】**概念，**赎回率与市场价格和赎回价格之间的偏差正负相反，可以通过算法自动调整，如果偏差越大，调整速度越快，偏差越小，调整速度越慢。**（即当市场价格＞赎回价格，赎回率为负 ；新赎回价格=（1+赎回率）\\*原赎回价格）例如，当赎回率为-10%/年，指一年后赎回价格为0.9。\n\n举个例子，当市场价格＞赎回价格时，在ETH价格和抵押率不变的情况下，通过计算负利率降低赎回价格，使得SAFE持有者借贷能力增强，增加市场上RAI供应量，让RAI价格下降。\n\n当市场价格＜赎回价格时，在ETH价格和抵押率不变的情况下，通过正利率提高赎回价格，使得SAFE持有者借贷能力减弱，减少市场上RAI供应量。\n\n[Stability without Pegs](https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/stability-without-pegs-8c6a1cbc7fbd)\n\n可见：赎回率的大小和 P(市场-赎回)；偏离持续时间；以及 P变化速率的大小有关；\n\n之后赎回价会在新的价格处达到新的平衡。\n\n![赎回率、赎回价格和市场价格的相互调节](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WIesX3FrHpxvJxdOEVQWG.jpg?height=1104&width=2593)\n\n**赎回率**\n\n**RAI价格稳定机制**的核心就是计算赎回率，该利率通过算法控制器PID控制器设定。PID控制器主要为了研究在不断变化的环境中，动态系统如何保持平衡和稳定。其原理是**通过控制系统输入，以便根据系统输出和设定值之间的偏差更新输入值。**PID控制器使用三个部分数学公式来确定其输出：\n\n> **控制器输出=比例单元+积分单元+导数单元**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xuCWYaxYSWkgTPoR95QLD.png?height=358&width=1436)\n\n通俗一点理解就是RAI依据市场价格与赎回价格之间的偏差幅度，偏差持续的时间和偏差移动的速度来计算出一个赎回利率，再依据市场情况计算**正负利率**，以此提高或降低赎回价格，从而令参与者进行套利，使得市场价格与赎回价格保持一个相对平衡的状态。\n\n综上来看，RAI的价格调整机制与MakerDAO存在很大不同，后者是通过**调整稳定费用（借款利率）**来实现保持代币稳定，类似于美联储如何通过利率调整货币供应。当 DAI 的市场价格高于 1 美元时，Maker 会降低利率以增加贷款供给并使价格回落；当 DAI 的市场价格低于 1 美元时，情况则相反。从而影响DAI的市场价格；\n\n前者则是通过调整**赎回价格**影响RAI的市场价格，借款利率或在一定程度上保持不变，这就意味着RAI并非拥有永不波动的价格，而是降低了价格的波动性，因为RAI赎回价格在经过调整后可能会回落到初始水平，但也可能会落在一个新的平衡位上。\n\n### 治理/激励模型\n\nFLX非治理代币的激励作用：\n\n<https://app.reflexer.finance/earn/incentives>\n\n不间断推出激励计划，紧密结合每一阶段的生态扩张目标：\n\n1、流动性激励-Uniswap\n\nRAI 铸造+ uniswap V2 （RAI/ETH ）LP激励 70M\n\nRAI 铸造+ uniswap V3

由创世生成以外，还有一部分将通过债务拍卖铸造生成。\n\n（1）**最后兜底的手段：FLX质押作为系统的最后贷款方，**一旦系统产生坏账发生清算时，权益池将开始拍卖FLX/ETH LP代币换取RAI，这一过程中，质押者的LP将被稀释，同时收到更多FLX 。（质押FLX 保护RAI 得FLX）FLX贷款解锁规则：一旦决定退出质押LP，要有21的锁定期/延迟；25%奖励立即领取，剩余75%奖励为6个月线性解锁；可以被拍卖的矿池百分比为 30%\n\n（2）**治理：**RAI的后续治理需求将逐渐减小，尽量移除人为治理因素，实现治理最小化，治理内容包括新增抵押品；更改外部接入，如预言机和DEX；调整利率控制器等。\n\n该代币分发：1、初始发行铸造100万（暂未铸造）；2、根据债务拍卖铸造。首批FLX于4月15日前后发放给早期参与者，发行量在4\\~5万。与MKR的代币经济模型很类似。\n\n**开发路线图及未来规划**\n\n2021/6/3

Leshner和a16z前合伙人Jesse Walden创办的新加密风投公司Variant Fund；2021年2 月，宣布完成A轮融资，**Pantera Capital和Lemniscap领投。**\n\n### 项目竞争力分析\n\n**行业分析**\n\n**行业概况**\n\n1、规模迅猛增长。今年 Tether（$62,514,011,525） 的供应量增加了 4 倍，USDC（$27,683,244,826） 增加了 6 倍，PAX（$928,078,261）增加了5倍。而借着 DeFi 浪潮，Dai （5,521,187,309）的市值暴涨了 15 倍，并且突破了 10 亿美元的门槛。\n\n2、发展历史：稳定币从最初的USDT“加密美元”、RUSD（受监管的稳定币，USDC、Libra）、Dai（去中心化加密美元）、算法稳定币。\n\n3、由于USDT最近两年的疯狂增发和对美元监管稳定币的担忧，加速去中心化稳定币的发展。算法稳定币的共同目标是：提供具有更高资金效率的去中心化稳定币，试图去解决半去中心化，和抵押型低效率稳定币的问题。\n\n**行业周期**\n\n目前，主要的**稳定币总市值约80B（是DeFi领域的最大战场）**，其中USDT、USDC、BUSD共占据市场88%，DAI作为去中心化稳定币的龙头，占据稳定币市场7%的份额。去中心化稳定币赛道正处于**成长期**，创新机制层出不穷，相信从中会出现未来加密货币体系中的通用货币。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WNXrxiYueX2CTLxP2LK8y.png?height=1208&width=1868)\n\n![稳定币生态图谱](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/t6lBzonM6NvSpM3murAWv.png?height=1300&width=2176)\n\n根据对已有的稳定币进行分类，可以分成中心化稳定币和去中心化稳定币；\n\n根据是否有抵押资产进行抵押：分为去中心抵押稳定币和算法稳定币\n\n根据其价格是否锚定法币，可以分为锚定法币稳定币和非锚定法币稳定币；其中与美元锚定的稳定币，存在未来受到美国货币政策的影响，从而成为美国“影子银行”的监管风险；因此，非锚定法币的去中心化稳定币，成为一个非常有想象力的赛道。\n\n### 竞争分析\n\n**竞争要素**\n\n判断算法稳定币是否合理，以及未来能否成功，就可以根据这两个层面：\n\n1、机制设计本身：价格稳定性；抵押清算设计\n\n2、市场表现：市值占比、代币流通的场景丰富度、生态延展能力（可扩展性和易用性）\n\n**竞争态势**\n\n包括行业梯队分层、主要竞争对手分析、与主要竞争对手相比当前项目的优劣势、竞争项目及主要竞争对手的数据及其比较分析等。\n\n**主要竞品有：MakerDAO和Liquity，都是抵押型去中心化稳定币，不同之处在于前两者是锚定法币的**\n\n**1、 MakerDAO**\n\nMakerDAO开创了去中心化抵押稳定币的先河，该项目于2014年创建，用户通过创建金库（Vault）超额抵押生成稳定币DAI，与美元保持1:1锚定。最低抵押率为150%。\n\nMaker的稳定机制主要通**过稳定费率（借款费率）以及存款利率**调整从而调节市场供需，稳定DAI的市场价格。在上线初期，DAI的价格波动较为剧烈，**最大偏离幅度达7%。**自2020年9月之后，市场价格相对较为稳定，多数为正向偏离，在一定程度上反映了市场对DAI的需求增加。\n\n**2、Liquity**\n\nLiquity是无息借贷，无法通过借款利率调节刺激市场的供需，但是Liquity会收取一次性的**赎回费用**，通过对赎回费率的调整去调节LUSD的赎回行为。当LUSD市场价格低于1美元时，赎回机制使得套利者在获得的ETH价值＞偿还LUSD数量+赎回费用时立即获得套利收益。而赎回的LUSD将被协议燃烧，市场供应减少。从当前的LUSD市场价格表现来看，**偏离幅度在1%\\~4%之间，相对较为稳定。**\n\n![ https://dune.xyz/HggqX/Reflexer-RAI](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EJuzn7G-EDGh7gx2U7Jd5.png?height=1096&width=1756)\n\n自RAI发行以来，其市场价格相对以上两种法定锚定稳定币而言，波动较为剧烈，但在一个月后，市场参与者对RAI的套利行为熟悉后，价格维持在了3左右，不过RAI本质上也并非锚定型的稳定币，基本证明了这一模式打造**稳定币的可行性。**\n\n3、抵押率越高，清算风险越小，抵押率越低，风险越高。\n\n**4、市值、市场占有率和应用场景**\n\n**市场采用率**\n\n（1）作为稳定币协议，大规模采用是衡量一个项目是否成功的重要指标。先从**发行量**来看，DAI当前发行量达52亿美元，居USDT、USDC、BUSD这些中心化抵押稳定币之后，是**去中心化稳定币之首**；LUSD发行量则约7.6亿美元，居第七位，**其发行规模为DAI的14.6%**；RAI本质上是一种【低波动性加密货币】，发行规模仅为842.3万美元，**其发行规模仅为DAI的1.5%**\n\n（2）作为一种支付媒介，**应用场景**是衡量需求的重要指标。以下是DAI、LUSD、RAI的资产分布情况。从图1来看，DAI当前的分布范围较广，从中心化交易所到去中心化交易所，所涵盖的应用场景包括流动性挖矿、借贷、DEX交易、二层等，是链上交易中重要的资产类型。LUSD当前发行量7.8亿，从图2来看，其中87.7%都质押在稳定币池中，11.7%分布在Curve池子中，市场流通的LUSD较少，流动性不足，不利于稳定币的大规模采用，从长远来看，会使得项目发展陷入闭环。\n\n![ 图1  https://duneanalytics.com/SebVentures/maker---accounting_1](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NnLj8jvBngZxJMIX83Jdl.png?height=662&width=1114)\n\n![ 图2  https://duneanalytics.com/dani/Liquity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/it-2BnEVMnHfSxNA2JAgf.png?height=978&width=1574)\n\n![ 图3 https://duneanalytics.com/HggqX/Reflexer-RAI](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MLaYkPTWLTI9jubaaHM5T.png?height=1208&width=2176)\n\n图3展现了RAI的分布情况。目前：有70%都集中在Uni的 RAI/ETH与 RAI/DAI中，在earn池有10%。RAI的发行量是1700万个Rai，以3$计算，其中大部分的RAI目前大部分仍在Reflexer体系内流转，外部流通很少。假如不算内部流转的Rai当前质押的 $159,100,102 资金规模仅产生了1530美元的真实应用场景下的流通量。\n\n**5、收入对比**\n\nMaker自2019年11月开始盈利，但是在经历312之后，很长一段时间内收入都无法回暖，2020年8月，随着整个DeFi行业的爆发，系统收入开始出现较大幅度增长，目前累计收入达6,210万美元，是DeFi中收益最好的协议之一；Liquity自2021年4月开始盈利，目前累计收入约1,400万美元；Reflexer自2021年2月开始盈利，至今累计收入达57.9万美元。\n\n![https://www.tokenterminal.com/home &  https://cryptofees.info/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZhTX5rmpXoVlqbKWgPsL7.png?height=336&width=842)\n\n### 项目地位\n\n1）**Reflexer创始人影响力大，项目背后有知名加密风投机构进行投资，开发资金充裕，**自项目上线以来，数据表现良好；\n\n2）RAI的借贷逻辑和核心组件配备（例如预言机、清算机制等）与MakerDAO基本相似，业务逻辑可行性较高，对RAI的发行有着较高的参考价值；\n\n3）非锚定型稳定币是稳定币实现方式的新探索，好处就是可以不受来自美元法币的负面影响，但是在计价单位、储值手段以及交易对这三项功能上，都会增加很多的不确定性，**市场可能需要较长时间才能认可和接受。**\n\n4）目前RAI主要集中在Uniswap中，虽然目前其规模较小，但是从动作中可以看到正在进一步扩展用例，随着应用场景不断丰富，有一定潜力。\n\n5）治理最小化，价格稳定手段由赎回机制这一算法进行调整，弱化治理过程中的人为因素。从而避免人为治理时无法实时应对并处理风险等问题。",

Such efficiency resembles bank transfers in Victoria England, not a new era enabled by Web 3.0.\n\nSuch inconvenience will cause the same assets in L1 to enjoy a much more “liquidity premium” than in various L2s both in spot price and TVL: people are less encouraged to lock assets in various L2s.\n\nThis entails \"Liquidity Fragmentation\", which basically means:\n\n1. participants are unable to conclude transactions in absence of enough liquidity in L2s.\n2. a clearing member or a protocol itself is forced to hold a specific position in certain assets to ensure transaction conclusion because no one else would, hence reducing its capital efficiency.\n\n**What is scalable Asset Bridge?**\n\nThere are two types of asset bridges to solve this problem.\n\nThe first one is a model that we call POA (proof of authority) for the time being, which can be taken as asset mapping. Simply put, it is to lock up assets in L1, and mint the corresponding tokens in L2; the same applies when transferring from L2 to L1. It is the conventional wisdom for most native “asset bridge” solutions, such as the Near rainbow bridge.\n\nThe other model is more scalable, it applies trading techniques (such as Automated Marketing Making, and flash loans, etc) to handle more sizable and frequent transactions across different layers. Instead of tunneling an asset across layers, a semi-decentralized trading protocol builds liquidity pools for the same assets in both L1 and L2. With such protocol, anyone can swap assets on time just like with Uniswap. In addition, it could provide liquidity providers with financial incentives.\n\nThis is what “Scalable Asset Bridges” look like. Fortunately, we have found some interesting early-stage products in this niche area.\n\nLet’s take a look. \n \n\n**1. Caspian (to launch in 2021)**\n\nCaspian is an asset bridge created by StarkEX, a decentralized trading engine. It is also a key component in Starkware infrastructure.\n\nCaspian works in the following manner.\n\n1)  Users (Alice and Bob) submit transactions on L2\n\n2)  An off-chain operator packages all the L2 transactions, and it is the sole entity trading against an L2 powered AMM on L1.\n\n3)  When there is a net difference in all batched L2 trades, the operator will trade on L1 to offset the net difference.\n\n![Starkware](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3VFGMFQLhboiXtUt2vTIk.png?height=358&width=700)\n\nOperators are responsible for packaging transactions, carrying out arbitrage of the difference, and determining the order of transactions. The operator could be a centralized entity, and it just mimics the logic of a smart contract. Casper is a powerful bridge because it allows liquidity to be bridged on L2 while remaining unfragmented on L1. A common user will seldomly need to bridge tokens by herself and just delegate the task to the operator.\n\nWe know that Caspian AMM is a complicated project and it relies heavily on StarkEx. The debut of StarkEx in Q2 2021 is a deterministic factor.\n\n**2. Hop.Exchange (test network launched already)**\n\nHop's goal is to provide a trading protocol across various Rollup networks and further achieve interoperability between Optimism, xDai, Polygon, and Arbitrum. The liquidity provider in the Hop protocol is called “bonders”, similar to Caspian's operators. Its product “Hop. Exchange” is currently ready for liquidity miners to participate in several pools, such as on Optimism and xDai.\n\nIn the soon future, it may also expand to a lot of other L2 projects.\n\n![Hop exchange](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kvcrzRZieLZamQP1zC17I.png?height=875&width=999)\n\n**3. Connext (demo product xPollinate launched)**\n\nConnext is special because it is based on a scaling solution called “state channel”. Two projects currently supporting state channels are xDai and Polygon. Connext itself is not an exchange, but a base-layer engine (like Starkex), and allows developers to develop DEX on it (like Caspian).\n\nIts demo product is called xPollinate, built by an enthusiastic team close to its community. As shown in the picture. Assets can be converted on xDAI, Polygon (Matic), and Fantom.\n\nIn Connext, similar to the operators of the above-mentioned projects, their core role is called “routers”, which can be taken as nodes in state channels. A router provides users with liquidity and earns commissions, and they can even bid for a transaction.\n\n![xPollinate on Connext](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hot0IFXS8IebC8C3xRjJZ.png?height=884&width=1040)\n\n**4. Loopring's Ethport (to launch in 2021)**\n\nAccording to an article on medium, the Loopring team has proposed a bridge solution back in January 2020. This year, they have proposed something even cooler: Ethport. It adopts a hybrid method that combines centralized trading, batch deposit, and flash minting.\n\nIf a user needs to sell/withdraw a large amount of L2 tokens and cannot match enough L1 tokens for a while, Ethport's converter will mint a large amount of 1:1 value tokens for L2 users, then package these tokens in batches to trade with L1's AMM protocol through the asset bridge, and distribute the tokens obtained from the transaction to users in the next block.\n\nEthport also depends on centralized operators to package and execute the trade on behalf of users. The good thing is that a certain degree of centralization will ensure that transaction order will not be messed by front runners.\n\n![Loopring Token Bridge](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cs-5_rIbqjADt1eYH3Wcr.png?height=540&width=960)\n\n**5. Degate** \n\nDegate is ambitious. Its roadmap aims to create an asset bridge and synthesize the functions of a token bridge, a DEX, a lending protocol, and a DAO. Degate seeks to be widely used in Rollop-like Layer2, and act as an essential token bridge in the realm of Arbitrum. \n \n\nAnother feature of Degate is that it has created an enhanced bonding curve to make sure users will enjoy much better capital efficiency. It is now launched with Kovan and Arbitrum testnet.\n\n![Degate Bridge](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fbgR6uuf5SjgAffjDg38D.png?height=866&width=1013)\n\n**Our conclusion**\n\nThe upcoming scalable asset bridges are no different from Defi protocols, they are bridging liquidity providers among various L1 and L2 networks.\n\nAfter researching on above projects, we find that scalable asset bridges have the following edges:\n\n1. Capacity to handle large and frequent asset transfers among L1 and various L2s\n2. Good trading experience: low slippage, high capital efficiency.\n3. Interoperability: better to work with both Roll-ups and Sidechains\n4. Trustlessness: decentralize the role of “operator”/ “bonder” / “router”\n\nWe hope to see more decentralized, trustless bridges that could transact both tokens and NFTs in the future.  \n ", "timestamp": 1635160414, "digest": "NkSojn6p2AekGqZqTeVhvaR_JvtkG5osxYYOZk5HnbY", "contributor": "0xed5960A454782C4C9c62AaE6E22a8A50c185e50F"}

This week we celebrate our milestones and reward faithful members who have contributed to the community during this important time of development, helping to build the foundations for the YGG DAO’s future success.\n\nEligibility for the airdrop was [based on a number of factors](https://medium.com/yield-guild-games/ygg-community-airdrop-snapshot-and-qualifications-12fd0278bd06?source=collection_home---6------8-----------------------) pertaining to contributions made by guild members and guided by a snapshot of Ethereum addresses taken on 8 September 2021**.**\n\n> ***As a twist on the usual style of airdrop, YGG is gamifying the process and giving eligible community members a range of options so they can choose what they want to do with the YGG Tokens and NFTs that they receive.***\n\nThe airdrop will simultaneously deliver: YGG Tokens, and also, two different NFTs. In order to claim their airdrop, eligible community members must go to the YGG website and mint their NFTs, which will appear in the form of a YGG Sword and YGG Shield. Each NFT contains an equal amount of YGG tokens, which will become accessible by the owner as their vesting period expires.\n\nThe Sword and Shield NFTs have been designed to have long-term utility in the YGG DAO, meaning they will have more functionality than a simple token dispensing mechanism. Please note that minting the Ethereum-based NFTs from the YGG website will require some gas fees.\n\nThe YGG tokens delivered via the airdrop will vest over a three month period. Vesting starts immediately at the time of the airdrop (not at the time the NFT is claimed). The decision to vest the tokens was made thoughtfully by the YGG team to smooth the distribution of tokens over a longer period of time.\n\nPlease note that there is no requirement for airdrop recipients to be holders of the YGG Guild Badge. More details on the eligibility requirements and snapshot qualifications can be found [here](https://medium.com/yield-guild-games/ygg-community-airdrop-snapshot-and-qualifications-12fd0278bd06).\n\n## How to claim the YGG Airdrop\n\nWatch the video tutorial above or read the step-by-step guide below.\n\n1\\. Go to <https://yieldguild.io/claim> and connect your Ethereum wallet to the YGG website.\n\n2\\. If your Ethereum address has been approved for the airdrop, you will see a “Congratulations, Airdrop found!” message and the **Claim Airdrop** button should be highlighted. If there is a message saying “No airdrop found,” it means that you were not eligible for the airdrop.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*iSn6JqYdYW94mgKrJ7V5JQ.png)\n\nIf you are eligible for the airdrop, you will see a message saying “Congratulations, Airdrop found!” and the “Claim Airdrop” button should be highlighted.\n\n3\\. If you have received the airdrop, you will see two tiles displayed representing the YGG Sword and Shield NFTs. Clicking on the **Claim Airdrop** button will prompt your wallet to conduct a transaction that will mint the two NFTs. When you see the prompt pop up in your MetaMask wallet, click **Confirm** to authorise the transaction (please note this will require you to pay Ethereum gas fees).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*HHqY_HMqyQ5M1QRgLB6P3g.png)\n\nClick “Claim Airdrop” and then click “Confirm” in your wallet, to mint the two NFTs.\n\n4\\. The NFTs will then be minted and delivered to your wallet. After the transaction has been confirmed by the network, you will see a new message appear at the top of the screen which reads “Airdrop Successfully Claimed.”\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*HwB3VUeXDU7WmkqJtzeDZw.png)\n\nOnce you have minted your NFTs, you will see a message saying “Airdrop Successfully Claimed.”\n\n5\\. That’s it. The NFTs can now be found in the contents of your Ethereum wallet, they will be easily viewable in your YGG inventory or on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), and they can be freely traded if their owner chooses to do so. However, the seller must note that any remaining unclaimed YGG Tokens, or those still locked in the NFT, will go with the NFT.\n\n## How to claim your vested YGG Tokens\n\nTo claim the tokens vested in the Sword and Shield NFTs, or check on their vesting status, click on the NFT in your YGG Inventory to reveal its statistics.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*HYnSrOaN7uB-S0Zve-h2qg.png)\n\nGo to your YGG Inventory to see your NFTs.\n\nIn the screenshot below, you can see how many tokens have been allocated to the NFT, and also, how many of those tokens are locked, claimed and/or claimable. Clicking on the **Claim Tokens** button will prompt a new transaction for the Ethereum network which will deliver the claimable token amount to your wallet (again, there will be gas fees associated with this transaction).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*swzAQvuewGtm6hGifp6YBQ.png)\n\nIn YGG Inventory, you can see the number of tokens allocated to the Sword NFT. You can also see how many tokens are locked, claimed, and claimable.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*btWzrYdLxGAuCIFtVy5ljA.png)\n\nAs above, but for the Shield NFT.\n\n## Airdrop Distribution\n\nYGG distributed a total 1.25M YGG tokens at a valuation of US$6.00 per token, equating to US$7.5M of value distributed to our community at the time of the drop. The total amount is vested via smart contract over a three month period beginning Friday, 22 October 2021.\n\n*   4,600 **Scholars** received a total of 939,598 tokens\n*   The **YGG Founders Coin holders** received a total of 250,000 tokens\n*   124 **Tier S contributors** received 37,879 Tokens\n*   The **YGGLOK holders** received a total of 7530 tokens\n*   10 **Community Leaders** received 6,868 Tokens\n*   15 **Scholarship Managers** received 5,000 tokens\n*   10 **members who are part of our play-to-earn council** received 3,125 Tokens\n\nAround **5,050 Ethereum addresses** should receive an airdrop with a valuation average of US$2,000 per ETH address at the time of the drop.\n\nYGG’s core team, extended team, partners, advisors and investors were not included in this drop unless they owned a Founders Coin or YGGLOK (the token associated with YGG’s League Of Kingdoms SubDAO).\n\n## **What if I didn’t qualify for the airdrop?**\n\nYGG understands that some people from within the community may be disappointed that they did not qualify for the airdrop. The airdrop was specifically designed to reward early community contributors and significant value creators for the guild and the process of determining airdrop eligibility underwent much consideration, guided by input from community leaders.\n\nYGG is currently working toward creating more opportunities and features for members to earn tokens and contribute value to the community. An example of this can be seen in the Tip Bot that has been set up in the [YGG Discord](https://discord.com/channels/768039848094334987).\n\nThe Tip Bot allows community members to tip YGG tokens or other types of crypto on the YGG Discord with no gas fees. Fees only apply when you deposit and withdraw. With this, community members can now send a tip to people who give value, help other people in the YGG community, and participate in AMAs, as well as other activities in the Discord channel.\n\nOur next airdrop-related article on YGG Medium will explain the significance of the YGG Sword and Shield NFTs.\n\n*To learn more about Yield Guild Games, please read our whitepaper *[*here*](https://yieldguild.io/YGG-Whitepaper-English.pdf)*.

If there is a message saying “No airdrop found,” it means that you were not eligible for the airdrop.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*iSn6JqYdYW94mgKrJ7V5JQ.png)\n\nIf you are eligible for the airdrop, you will see a message saying “Congratulations, Airdrop found!” and the “Claim Airdrop” button should be highlighted.\n\n3\\. If you have received the airdrop, you will see two tiles displayed representing the YGG Sword and Shield NFTs. Clicking on the **Claim Airdrop** button will prompt your wallet to conduct a transaction that will mint the two NFTs. When you see the prompt pop up in your MetaMask wallet, click **Confirm** to authorise the transaction (please note this will require you to pay Ethereum gas fees).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*HHqY_HMqyQ5M1QRgLB6P3g.png)\n\nClick “Claim Airdrop” and then click “Confirm” in your wallet, to mint the two NFTs.\n\n4\\. The NFTs will then be minted and delivered to your wallet. After the transaction has been confirmed by the network, you will see a new message appear at the top of the screen which reads “Airdrop Successfully Claimed.”\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*HwB3VUeXDU7WmkqJtzeDZw.png)\n\nOnce you have minted your NFTs, you will see a message saying “Airdrop Successfully Claimed.”\n\n5\\. That’s it. The NFTs can now be found in the contents of your Ethereum wallet, they will be easily viewable in your YGG inventory or on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), and they can be freely traded if their owner chooses to do so. However, the seller must note that any remaining unclaimed YGG Tokens, or those still locked in the NFT, will go with the NFT.\n\n## How to claim your vested YGG Tokens\n\nTo claim the tokens vested in the Sword and Shield NFTs, or check on their vesting status, click on the NFT in your YGG Inventory to reveal its statistics.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*HYnSrOaN7uB-S0Zve-h2qg.png)\n\nGo to your YGG Inventory to see your NFTs.\n\nIn the screenshot below, you can see how many tokens have been allocated to the NFT, and also, how many of those tokens are locked, claimed and/or claimable. Clicking on the **Claim Tokens** button will prompt a new transaction for the Ethereum network which will deliver the claimable token amount to your wallet (again, there will be gas fees associated with this transaction).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*swzAQvuewGtm6hGifp6YBQ.png)\n\nIn YGG Inventory, you can see the number of tokens allocated to the Sword NFT. You can also see how many tokens are locked, claimed, and claimable.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*btWzrYdLxGAuCIFtVy5ljA.png)\n\nAs above, but for the Shield NFT.\n\n## Airdrop Distribution\n\nYGG distributed a total 1.25M YGG tokens at a valuation of US$6.00 per token, equating to US$7.5M of value distributed to our community at the time of the drop. The total amount is vested via smart contract over a three month period beginning Friday, 22 October 2021.\n\n*   4,600 **Scholars** received a total of 939,598 tokens\n*   The **YGG Founders Coin holders** received a total of 250,000 tokens\n*   124 **Tier S contributors** received 37,879 Tokens\n*   The **YGGLOK holders** received a total of 7530 tokens\n*   10 **Community Leaders** received 6,868 Tokens\n*   15 **Scholarship Managers** received 5,000 tokens\n*   10 **members who are part of our play-to-earn council** received 3,125 Tokens\n\nAround **5,050 Ethereum addresses** should receive an airdrop with a valuation average of US$2,000 per ETH address at the time of the drop.\n\nYGG’s core team, extended team, partners, advisors and investors were not included in this drop unless they owned a Founders Coin or YGGLOK (the token associated with YGG’s League Of Kingdoms SubDAO).\n\n## **What if I didn’t qualify for the airdrop?**\n\nYGG understands that some people from within the community may be disappointed that they did not qualify for the airdrop. The airdrop was specifically designed to reward early community contributors and significant value creators for the guild and the process of determining airdrop eligibility underwent much consideration, guided by input from community leaders.\n\nYGG is currently working toward creating more opportunities and features for members to earn tokens and contribute value to the community. An example of this can be seen in the Tip Bot that has been set up in the [YGG Discord](https://discord.com/channels/768039848094334987).\n\nThe Tip Bot allows community members to tip YGG tokens or other types of crypto on the YGG Discord with no gas fees. Fees only apply when you deposit and withdraw. With this, community members can now send a tip to people who give value, help other people in the YGG community, and participate in AMAs, as well as other activities in the Discord channel.\n\nOur next airdrop-related article on YGG Medium will explain the significance of the YGG Sword and Shield NFTs.\n\n*To learn more about Yield Guild Games, please read our whitepaper *[*here*](https://yieldguild.io/YGG-Whitepaper-English.pdf)*.

DAO 挖矿 (31%)\n\n3\\. 贡献者 (30%)\n\n4\\. DAO 储备 (10%)\n\n### 开发路线图及未来规划\n\n7\\.9启动 Boule 委员会评选\n\n7\\.12-19 发布第三次测验，发放空投\n\n7\\.31 推出 AladdinDAO Boule *Plus，更有效地治理社区*\n\n**Boule Plus** 是**7**月底推出的，其工作机制如下：\n\n• 社区成员可以通过质押 5,000 个 ALD 以获得1 ALDPLUS;\n\n• 拥有ALDPLUS 通证，代表着 Boule Plus 会员的投票权以及收取奖励权。\n\n• 可以随时赎回 ALD （但是，为了获得奖励，Boule Plus 会员需要在每个时间段（为期 2 周）的奖励结算时持有 ALDPLUS 通证）\n\n• 在 Snapshot 上投票（对你认为表现出色的矿池投赞成票；对你认为表现不佳的矿池投反对票）；每月最多投 4 票；\n\n• 投赞成票给表现出色的矿池的选民，可分享 2% 的代币供应量奖池；投反对票给表现不佳的矿池的选民，可分享 2% 的代币供应量奖池；\n\n• 即使错误投票也不会造成任何损失。\n\n**带来的变化**——这一设计丰富了阿拉丁DAO的用户层次，降低了DeFi爱好者加入的成本，并且质押了更多的ALD，有助于扩大参与者规模和拉升币价。\n\n目前是一个提供【**一站式流动性挖矿体验】**的平台，并使用博弈论来构建去中心化的资产管理市场，以简单的策略入手，使投资者可以直接参与所选定的 DeFi 流动性挖矿项目。未来希望扩展到由【社区开发者和 DAO 成员提供的多策略产品】。\n\n### 团队及投资机构\n\n团队介绍：创始成员包括 Polychain、DCG、1kx、Multicoin Capital、CMS、Nascent、Alameda、DeFi Alliance、Robert Leshner、Kain Warwick、Hart Lambur、Alex Pack、Ashwin Ramachandran 和 Sharlyn Wu。\n\nSharlyn Wu原为Huobi Innovation Labs负责人\n\n### 项目竞争力分析\n\n**行业分析**\n\n**行业概况**\n\n行业发展概况，包括技术、生态的发展历史和现状等。影响行业发展的有利和不利因素，如产业政策、技术替代。\n\n传统的资产管理是 DeFi 市场相对沉寂的领域，这个领域中的协议数量包括本文项目在内仅有12个；锁仓金额在3 至 5 亿美元的规模。是DeFi市场的蓝海。\n\n而Farm作为DeFi兴起后，成为了加密投资领域一种重要的投资和收益方式，专注于这一细分领域的资管需求旺盛，【收益聚合】就是对流动性挖矿进行资产管理的新兴赛道。按照流动性挖矿分配占项目初期代币分配的10%来算，这一领域目前的潜在价值至少有7B。未来随着更多的项目推出，这一长期的治理和激励模式，会长期存在。资管赛道也会向挖矿这一收益方式转型。\n\n**行业周期**\n\n**市场规模**\n\n目前我把去中心化资管赛道，大致分为四大类：交易策略、指数产品、打新平台、收益聚合。\n\n1、社交投资的主动管理：Tokensets、Enzyme、dHedge、Deplutus（面向现货衍生品交易、对冲）\n\n2、指数挂钩被动模式：NFTX、DPI、sDEFI（资产包or一揽子代币指数）\n\n3、收益聚合：Yearn、Cream、Bunny、Cream（又称为机枪池，主要有质押挖矿和流动性提供挖矿）其中收益聚合是资管赛道中最活跃的赛道，根据debank当日数据，**有62个项目，TVL将近 15B；**\n\n### 竞争分析\n\n**竞争要素**\n\n根据上述行业分析结论，归纳总结进入行业的主要障碍、以及竞争关键资源或要素等。\n\n关键资源有两个：\n\n1、平台协议安全和风控设计——需要进一步借鉴和加强\n\n2、新矿发现：信息渠道和项目辨识能力\n\n3、挖矿策略设计：社区集体智慧和策略开发及部署能力\n\n**竞争态势**\n\n包括行业梯队分层、主要竞争对手分析、与主要竞争对手相比当前项目的优劣势、竞争项目及主要竞争对手的数据及其比较分析等。\n\n**1、YFI、InstaDapp（流动性优势）**\n\n其中YFI是开山鼻祖，基本模式是存入稳定币/其他币，项目治理组织社区提出优质的收益策略，用户存币，平台协议统一将用户代币存入到不同矿池中，收取管理费用。这些聚合项目focus在uni V3和compound等主流矿池，基本不会挖头矿。目前TVL在3B，收益率在2%-20%（APY）；\n\n根据以往经验，头矿年化一般可以达到500&-3000%（持续1-2周）。\n\n（数据来源：https://debank.com/projects?chain=&tag=yield_aggregator）\n\nAladdin专注挖矿资产管理，结合了【头矿打新】+【收益聚合】，并在DAO这一环节作出了创新：即【如何让社区找到最优投资标】。由于流动性迁移几乎没有成本，并且迁移的依据主要有2:安全性和收益率；如果Aladinn能够满足【如何让社区挑选出最好项目】这个环节问题，进而让这种能力赋能平台、捕获价值，其潜在市场很可观。\n\n潜在问题：可以想像未来Aladinn平台上会有头矿池+主流矿池（如Uni）头矿的资金承受能力是有限的，这一块能够吸引的用户资金量也是有限的；如何开发收益复合策略，保持收益处于市场较高水平，是平台竞争力的来源。\n\n**2、Nansen Alpha（工具优势：加密数据分析网站的最高级订阅和非工具类的增值服务）**\n\n**掌握海量数据**的 Nansen 团队而言，他们不仅可以为机构和专业投资用户提供工具，他们自己也成立了研究团队，为更高阶的订阅用户提供更为深度的解读服务。\n\nNansen 表示，一部分内部的分析师专门服务于**「Alpha」**客户*（他们平台最高阶的用户等级）*，提供关于**「Smart Money」**的每日动向和相关情报，产品名为 Alpha Radar。另外对于 Alpha 客户，他们还提供了每周的电话会议以及私密的 Telegram 群组，通过这个方式为高阶用户提供讨论、分析的场所。会有人为了加入这些群组和每周的独家会议而订阅 Alpha 服务。\n\n但是工具本身是为了更好的投资决策，本质在于人的使用和激励产出。\n\n**3、Visor——NFT流动性挖矿主动管理（提前布局并整合了新资产标准）**\n\n**Visor TVL 9.7M**\n\nAPY 23%-2000%\n\n随着UniswapV2转向V3，Aave开始接受NFT作为质押物，越来越多的DeFi项目通过引入NFT描述挖矿方式，带来更精细、多样化的投资选择。Visor 提出：下一代流动性挖矿将是把 *NFT Smart Vault* 引入DeFi；原有的收益聚合都是用ERC20进行挖矿，收益率是均质的；Visor通过进一步管理V3的LPtoken，进一步提高收益率本身。这种功能会随着DeFi项目发展越来越常见，并集成在收益聚合项目中。Visor有几个值得借鉴的地方：\n\n• LP声誉：提供丰富的历史记录和对单个流动资金来源的准确分析：通过辨认地址的治理投票记录以及是否经常性进行“白嫖”或者“投机”，将“好”的地址列入挖矿白名单。\n\n• 资金安全：将保管权和资产主权保留在Smart Vault中，以使资金永远不会面临风险；项目方不能通过任何的合约漏洞抽走用户资产。\n\n• 2B：更多考虑Ls的需求，设计一整套变量来多维度衡量流动性奖励，比如约束LP必须提供多久流动性才能获得更高奖励。未来不仅是用户选择优质项目，优质项目也选择稳定优质的流动性。Aladin未来也应开发相似的策略。\n\nVisor twitter 10.1K，tg3 3123，有一个自设的GAMMA 研究机构做LP主动管理策略，内部成员孵化的策略有限，长期来看，该赛道的核心竞争力在于策略创新能力，Aladdin长期看更有优势。\n\n### 项目地位\n\nAladdin实际上是从【人】为切入口，试图解决收益聚合这一赛道，对新项目的不敏感性、投资策略不是全局最优的问题，是从另一个维度，优化了这一赛道。不是零和博弈的关系。Aladdin所创造的挖矿投资去中心化组织，成为生态版图中的必要一环。", "timestamp": 1635161471, "digest": "6ImAryvFigRFD6tD5E-QDvR0hG9KEbeOLZTDzXSXDvo", "contributor": "0x3c8Fe0930D5A67a5b58D8991f3Dd5c5C97333951"}

After going to the Sziget Festival when he was 18, NTO started to hang out regularly at La Villa Rouge, and Bar Live, two legendary clubs in the South of France. At the time, German minimal techno music was booming and Anthony Favier would spend his nights listening to Stephan Bodzin, James Holden, or the very beginnings of Paul Kalkbrenner. \n\nThe story behind NTO is also about his friendship with Worakls and Joachim Pastor, with whom he created Hungry Music in 2013. Performing together on the Olympia’s stage to the Vieilles Charrues Festival, they learned to master the stage. Thanks to his hits \"Trauma\" and \"La clé des champs\", which account for several millions of streams on DSPs, NTO's career took off internationally. \n\nToday, NTO is about to start a new chapter of his career.

{"id": "ng9L-GPGo1rVmCDCgnfTOvwC9i8sfCzf4m-u7mSmtnc", "title": "Solv Protocol ：新NFT标准能做什么？", "body": "### 背景知识：NFT底层协议标准说明\n\n**与ERC20协议相似的，NFT有三种底层协议标准——ERC-721，ERC-1155，ERC-998。**\n\n**1、ERC-20**：即FT；其主要优势在于可计算，但是缺乏描述能力，如果想要描述100类token，必须要编写100个不同的ERC20合约，发布100种不同的ERC20 tokens。每个token仅有数量属性。\n\n**2、ERC-721：每个NFT都是独一无二、没有同类、不可拆分。——不可计算**\n\n描述能力强，可以通过创建一个ERC721合约，然后铸造100个不同的NFT，每个NFT/token都有一个Token ID。案例：加密猫\n\n**3、ERC-1155：**\n\n描述能力强，可以通过创建一个ERC1155合约，然后铸造100个不同的Token ID，每个ID都是一个类别，\\*\\*一个类别中的token没有任何区别，有数量属性。\\*\\*这里的ID和ERC721对比来看的区别是：ID不再是某个物品，**而是一个类别。**\n\n案例：游戏中的一类道具：ERC1155可以满足不同场景下的灵活需求，比如同时转账多数量的多类别资产，也可以转账多数量的同一类别资产，大大提高了转账的快捷方便程度。\n\n**4、ERC-998：可组合非同质化代币（Composable NFTs,缩写为CNFT）。它的结构设计是一个标准化延伸**可以让任何一个NFT可以拥有其他NFT或FT。\\*\\*转移CNFT时，就是转移CNFT所拥有的整个层级结构和所属关系。\\*\\*简单来说就是ERC-998可以包含多个ERC-721和ERC-20形式的代币。具体方式是通过父tokenID映射到子token合约地址，当子token是NFT/FT时，子合约地址映射到对应的子tokenID/余额。\n\n**5、可拆分NFT（Fractional NFT**）——不在资产底层协议标准层面\n\n**有另外一种分割NFT的方法，即对于不可分割的NFT，对其所有权进行分割**；**Fractional 协议** 使 **NFT** 所有者能够对自己的作品进行所有权分割，分割后的代币可以作为正常的 **ERC-20** 进行使用，从而实现百分比买卖。\n\n**6、为NFT-721增加“数量”属性的vNFT、通过 SLOT机制为token ID进行分类**\n\n![vNFT在整个token协议分类中的位置](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/efMQC_U-aLx35SrpfA8nQ.png?height=738&width=1080)\n\n![vNFT的数据结构](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hMRVib_BqUSPbeQVDTRbM.jpg?height=599&width=2079)\n\n**vNFT——兼容ERC-721**\n\n1、数量   2、SLOT作为NFT的抽象和归类机制  3、定义了 ERC-721 的扩展，与ERC-721兼容，支持灵活的拆分。\n\n一个SLOT代表一个类别，圈定了一组特定的属性，如果任何两个vNFT，都具有这一组属性，且这一组属性都一模一样，那就可以被归为这个SLOT所代表的类别中。被归为一类的vNFT就可以进行数量的加减。\n\n本项目的vNFT 标准已提交EIP-3525，并已于2021/10/20被以太坊正式收录：<https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/3641>\n\n### 业务模型\n\n**什么是Vouchers？**\n\nSolv Vouchers 是 Voucher 的铸造、管理和交易的 DeFi 平台，为项目方提供更便捷、灵活、低成本的锁仓 Token 管理工具。Voucher是一种装有锁仓Token的NFT，可根据预先设定的模式自动释放Token。可以简单理解为SAFT协议的NFT化。\n\n**为什么要铸造Vouchers？**\n\n大部分项目选择将Vesting Tokens直接存入自己编写的智能合约中，这种模式让锁仓额度彻底被“锁死”。Solv Vouchers 帮助项目方灵活的编程NFT，用来代表锁仓额度，从而让锁仓额度的流动性被彻底释放。\n\n**Vouchers具体可以用来做什么？**\n\n**1、额度管理：大幅下降锁仓额度的管理成本**\n\n当项目将锁仓 Token 份额分发给投资人与用户时，需要付出不菲的管理成本，包括 SAFT 协议的签署、按规定承兑 Token，协助持有者转移所有权等。\n\n项目方可以将应该锁仓的 Token 存入智能合约，设置好相应的锁仓期限和解锁方式，便可铸造出代表着该项目锁仓额度的 Voucher。\n\nVoucher 将严格按照铸造时所设定的模式自动释放 Token，为项目方免去了复杂的 SAFT 协议签署以及相关智能合约开发与部署等额外成本。\n\n**Solv Vouchers 支持多种 Token 锁仓方式与操作**\n\nSolv Vouchers 支持线性、单点、阶段、预言机驱动等多种锁仓方式，以及灵活的锁仓时间设定。在释放过程中，Voucher 持有人还可以进行提取、转让、拆分、合并等操作。\n\n对项目方来说，通过铸造 Voucher 来管理额度，是一种更便捷、灵活且低成本的方式。Solv Vouchers 让管理成千上万个额度持有者成为可能。\n\n**2、额度交易：让额度的流转交易更高效——Solv Vouchers Marketplace和支持ERC-721的NFT交易平台**\n\n锁仓Token的交易往往发生在OTC市场，一个充满欺诈、不透明、低效率的市场。这让额度的流动变得尤其困难。通过将锁仓额度通证化，我们将构建一个高透明、低欺诈、无交易对手方风险的链上额度交易市场，让额度持有者以更高效的方式获得流动性。\n\n**Solv Vouchers Marketplace支持全新的碎片化购买**\n\n因vNFT标准下的Voucher本身支持灵活的拆分功能，因此人们可以在内置交易平台 Solv Vouchers Marketplace 进行碎片化购买，即一次性仅购买一部分锁仓 Token。大幅度降低锁仓额度交易的摩擦，促使交易的发生。\n\nVoucher 采用的通证标准 vNFT 与ERC-721兼容，因此 Voucher 可以被所有支持 ERC-721 的交易平台天然支持，比如 **Opensea** 支持 Voucher 的多种交易模式，并支持查询链上 Voucher。\n\n**3、Voucher 借贷：通过借贷释放Voucher流动性**\n\n在传统股权市场中，股票质押是股东获取流动性的一个重要方式，DeFi项目的核心成员往往都具有大量锁仓Token。借贷服务将为锁仓Token持有者提供全新的流动性来源。\n\n相比艺术品或收藏品类 NFT，Voucher 是一种更偏向金融场景的NFT资产，在清算、评估价格等方面更适配借贷金融服务。NFTfi等支持ERC721借贷的协议将天然支持Voucher，同时Aave等借贷领先者也已进入这一领域。\n\n**4、 Repo回购市场**\n\n通过将正在流通的 Token 铸造为 Voucher，项目方可以用再回购协议的形式建立流动性管理机制，以一种更为灵活和有效的方式来管理 Token 流通量价格。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oa4NTlMbABg2DLrcKQ7EZ.png?height=379&width=1745)\n\n### 经济模型\n\n较为均衡，且解锁日均在IDO 60天后。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LzkcM0KgyjPv1rNeWXGyM.png?height=1072&width=2170)\n\n\\*TGE：是指$SOLV的 IDO日期。\n\n\\*\\*Cliff days：从IDO日算起，60天后开始进行释放。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oY_3oY0z403DurTAZ0oAh.png?height=1098&width=2270)\n\n### 收入来源\n\nSolv Marketplace的手续费收入；\n\n持有solv拥有打新资格，以及相关生态治理权（在设计中）\n\n### 特色与优势\n\n1、项目提出了新的NFT标准3525，这个标准是一个适合Financial NFT的token标准，它与ERC-721兼容，并同时支持灵活的拆分。此标准目前已提交EIP，<https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/3641>\n\n2、基于这一技术基础，力图打造DeFi NFT的基础设施、生产工厂和交易市场。全面优化过去的匀质、缺乏个性化、较为粗放的DeFi产品生态。事实证明：Uniswap v3的成功，预示着DeFi会进一步向以vNFT为特点的非匀质资产方向转型。\n\n3、额度发行、管理与交易平台 Solv Vouchers 是 Solv 团队基于 VNFT 开发的第一个 DeFi 应用。其中Allocation market是solv vouchers下的第一个市场，之后会有一个和份额市场平级的回购市场。目前Allocation market已与 DODO、Parsiq、Bounce、NAOS Finance、Ankr、Saffron Finance、Impossible Finance

IOHK\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zS2YzNw9tmwTTcfPYPyxE.png?height=1406&width=2500)\n\n### Cardano 的公链模型\n\nCardano 的模型通过创建扩展的 UTXO 模型（eUTXO）回归到行业的根源。它本质上是一个 UTXO，但具有两个附加功能——维护合约状态的能力和用于整个事务序列上的执行相同合约代码的能力。eUTXO 为交易添加了自定义数据和值，这允许任意逻辑与这些交易进行交互并打开智能合约的大门。\n\n### 共识机制\n\n#### 权益证明\n\nOuroboros 是一种基于权益证明 (PoS) 的加密货币免许可共识机制。它在 Cardano 区块链上实现，并带有一种称为 ADA 的加密货币。PoS 中的验证者不使用像 BTC 的 PoW 这样的矿工网络，而是使用他们的 ADA 股份参与验证和验证交易。\n\n所有做出贡献的验证者都会获得 ADA 奖励，而那些将其 ADA 代币委托给权益池的验证者也会获得与其权益相关的奖励。ADA 持有者可以参与对未来功能的投票，例如 Project Catalyst 投票。\n\nHydra(二层扩容方案) 是 Cardano 改变游戏规则的可扩展性解决方案，这意味着每秒交易 (TPS) 可高达 100 万。它借助 UTxO 技术使 Cardano 成为一个稳定的全球系统。\n\nCardano 量子证明使用 Sha-256 加密哈希函数，它允许任意长度的输入成为固定长度的输出。此外，输入是不可能从输出哈希中导出的。\n\n特别是，为了针对其他区块链上的速度和扩展问题提供最佳解决方案，Cardano 区块链分为两个主要层：\n\n* 结算层：该层的工作原理类似于包含由 Cardano PoS 协议验证的所有历史交易的分类帐。\n* 计算层：在卡尔达诺上运行的 DApp 层，实施智能合约。\n\n## 一些相关名词解释\n\n### Haskell\n\nHaskell是一种函数语言，对比于常用的 C/C++/Java/Python等 Imperative Langauge。 Imperative Language是以statement为主，把要做的工作描述在程序里，由电脑按步就班的执行。 Functional Language 是以构建函数为主，就像是数学证明一样，每一个函数会回复一些值（或函数），而函数可能参考到其他函数，由此组成完整的功能。\n\n### Plutus\n\nPlutus 是 Haskell 加上区块链和Smart Contract 的功能。\n\n## 生态系统\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EusR4HAlrkMXbeebKwVJt.png?height=1406&width=2500)\n\n#### 去中心化交易所\n\n**[Minswap](https://minswap.org/)**\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第四季度\n\n简介：2021 年 9 月 1 日，Cardno 测试网首先进行了阿朗佐硬分叉。不久之后，一个崭露头角的去中心化交易所「Minswap」于 9 月 3 日推出了他们的测试网，成为第一个部署在 Cardano 上的 Dapp。\n\n**[Cardaswap](https://cardaswap.finance/)**\n\n简介：在 Cardano 区块链上交换、赚取和构建下一代 DEX。在对所有人开放且可访问的金融市场中进行交易、搭建桥梁并成为流动性提供者。\n\n**[Cardax](https://cardax.io/)**\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第四季度\n\n简介：Cardax 是一个去中心化交易所，允许用户用 ADA 交易任何 Cardano 链上的原生代币。\n\n**[Yayswap](https://yayswap.io/)**\n\n跨链桥测试网：<https://yayswap.io/bridge/>\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第四季度\n\n简介：Cardano 区块链上的第一个高性能去中心化交易平台。\n\n**[Ergodex](https://ergodex.io/)**\n\n测试网：<https://beta.ergodex.io/>\n\n简介：ErgoDEX 是一个非托管的、去中心化的交易所，允许在 Ergo 和 Cardano 网络之间快速、轻松和安全地转移流动性。\n\n**[Adax](https://adax.pro/)**\n\n简介：ADAX 是一种自动化流动性协议，以完全去中心化和非托管的方式促进 Cardano 生态系统内的交易。\n\n**[Sundaeswap](https://www.sundaeswap.finance/)**\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第三季度\n\n简介：Cardano 区块链上的原生、可扩展的去中心化交易所\n\n#### 借贷\n\n**[Meld](https://www.meld.com/)**\n\n发布时间：预计 2021 年第三季度\n\n简介：MELD 是 Cardano 上第一个用于借贷法定货币和加密货币的去中心化、非托管协议\n\n**[Aada](https://medium.com/@aada.finance)**\n\n简介：Aada 是 Cardano 上的加密资产借贷平台。智能合约允许存入资产并收取利息或借入资产并执行财务操作。\n\n**[Liqwid Finance](https://www.liqwid.finance/)**\n\n简介：个基于流动性提供者供应和借款人需求的利率曲线算法和非托管流动性协议。\n\n#### 合成资产平台\n\n**[Indigo Protocol](https://indigoprotocol.io/)**\n\n上线时间：2021 年 10 月\n\n简介：Indigo 是一种基于 Cardano 的算法、自主合成协议，用于对现实世界资产进行链上价格敞口。\n\n#### 衍生品市场\n\n**[Matrixswap](https://www.matrixswap.io/)**\n\n简介：是一个部署在 Polkadot、Cardano、Polygon 上的去中心化多链永续合约平台。\n\n#### 去中心化保险\n\n**[Ensuro](https://ensuro.co/aboutus.html)**\n\n简介：未有更多进展。\n\n#### NFT/ 链游\n\n**[Bondly （多链）](https://www.bondly.finance/default)**\n\n简介：Bondly 将通过加密项目、品牌和艺术家为下一代数字收藏品提供动力。\n\n**[Adazoo NFT](https://www.adazoo.com/)**\n\n上线时间：预计第三季度末\n\n简介：ADAZOO 是在 Cardano 区块链上运行的首批基于 NFT 的游戏之一。\n\n**[Cnft](https://cnft.io/)**\n\n简介：是 Cardano 上的 NFT 交易市场。\n\n**[Sushibytes](https://www.sushibyte.io/)**\n\n上线时间：预计 2021 年秋季\n\n简介：是在 Cardano 区块链上运行的首批基于 NFT 的游戏之一。\n\n**[Artano](https://artano.io/)**\n\n简介：是 Cardano 区块链上的一个全球社区驱动的 NFT 市场。\n\n参考资料：\n\n> 1.

IOHK\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zS2YzNw9tmwTTcfPYPyxE.png?height=1406&width=2500)\n\n### Cardano 的公链模型\n\nCardano 的模型通过创建扩展的 UTXO 模型（eUTXO）回归到行业的根源。它本质上是一个 UTXO，但具有两个附加功能——维护合约状态的能力和用于整个事务序列上的执行相同合约代码的能力。eUTXO 为交易添加了自定义数据和值，这允许任意逻辑与这些交易进行交互并打开智能合约的大门。\n\n### 共识机制\n\n#### 权益证明\n\nOuroboros 是一种基于权益证明 (PoS) 的加密货币免许可共识机制。它在 Cardano 区块链上实现，并带有一种称为 ADA 的加密货币。PoS 中的验证者不使用像 BTC 的 PoW 这样的矿工网络，而是使用他们的 ADA 股份参与验证和验证交易。\n\n所有做出贡献的验证者都会获得 ADA 奖励，而那些将其 ADA 代币委托给权益池的验证者也会获得与其权益相关的奖励。ADA 持有者可以参与对未来功能的投票，例如 Project Catalyst 投票。\n\nHydra(二层扩容方案) 是 Cardano 改变游戏规则的可扩展性解决方案，这意味着每秒交易 (TPS) 可高达 100 万。它借助 UTxO 技术使 Cardano 成为一个稳定的全球系统。\n\nCardano 量子证明使用 Sha-256 加密哈希函数，它允许任意长度的输入成为固定长度的输出。此外，输入是不可能从输出哈希中导出的。\n\n特别是，为了针对其他区块链上的速度和扩展问题提供最佳解决方案，Cardano 区块链分为两个主要层：\n\n* 结算层：该层的工作原理类似于包含由 Cardano PoS 协议验证的所有历史交易的分类帐。\n* 计算层：在卡尔达诺上运行的 DApp 层，实施智能合约。\n\n## 一些相关名词解释\n\n### Haskell\n\nHaskell是一种函数语言，对比于常用的 C/C++/Java/Python等 Imperative Langauge。 Imperative Language是以statement为主，把要做的工作描述在程序里，由电脑按步就班的执行。 Functional Language 是以构建函数为主，就像是数学证明一样，每一个函数会回复一些值（或函数），而函数可能参考到其他函数，由此组成完整的功能。\n\n### Plutus\n\nPlutus 是 Haskell 加上区块链和Smart Contract 的功能。\n\n## 生态系统\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EusR4HAlrkMXbeebKwVJt.png?height=1406&width=2500)\n\n### 基础设施\n\nAdapools 是一个基于网站的工具，用于监测池和分析卡尔达诺区块链的数据。ADApools 集成在 Yoroi Wallet 和 Daedalus Wallet 中，以方便用户。\n\nBlockfrost 是一个在 Cardano 区块链上提供 API 服务的基于 web 的平台。它消除了复杂性，因此客户可以在 Cardano 上创建自己的分散式应用程序。\n\n### 去中心化交易所\n\n**[Minswap](https://minswap.org/)**\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第四季度\n\n简介：2021 年 9 月 1 日，Cardno 测试网首先进行了阿朗佐硬分叉。不久之后，一个崭露头角的去中心化交易所「Minswap」于 9 月 3 日推出了他们的测试网，成为第一个部署在 Cardano 上的 Dapp。\n\n**[Cardaswap](https://cardaswap.finance/)**\n\n简介：在 Cardano 区块链上交换、赚取和构建下一代 DEX。在对所有人开放且可访问的金融市场中进行交易、搭建桥梁并成为流动性提供者。\n\n**[Cardax](https://cardax.io/)**\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第四季度\n\n简介：Cardax 是一个去中心化交易所，允许用户用 ADA 交易任何 Cardano 链上的原生代币。\n\n**[Yayswap](https://yayswap.io/)**\n\n跨链桥测试网：<https://yayswap.io/bridge/>\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第四季度\n\n简介：Cardano 区块链上的第一个高性能去中心化交易平台。\n\n**[Ergodex](https://ergodex.io/)**\n\n测试网：<https://beta.ergodex.io/>\n\n简介：ErgoDEX 是一个非托管的、去中心化的交易所，允许在 Ergo 和 Cardano 网络之间快速、轻松和安全地转移流动性。\n\n**[Adax](https://adax.pro/)**\n\n简介：ADAX 是一种自动化流动性协议，以完全去中心化和非托管的方式促进 Cardano 生态系统内的交易。\n\n**[Sundaeswap](https://www.sundaeswap.finance/)**\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第三季度\n\n简介：Cardano 区块链上的原生、可扩展的去中心化交易所\n\n### IDO平台\n\n* Cardstarter 是一个去中心化的加速器和swap平台，也是启动项目的启动平台。例如，Oracle Charli3 C3在 Cardstarter 上就是一个成功的 IDO。目前，许多突出的项目正在等待Cardstarter准备推出。\n* **OccamFi** 是一个为项目筹集资金的 IDO 平台。\n* TrustPad 是一个为初创公司提供的多链式筹款平台，支持各种区块链，如 Ethereum、 Binance Smart Chain、 Polygon、 Polkadot 和 Cardano。\n* 对于初创公司来说，Vent Finance 是一个理想的融资平台，它有一个易于使用的界面，无论用户之前在加密世界的经验如何。\n\n### 借贷\n\n**[Meld](https://www.meld.com/)**\n\n发布时间：预计 2021 年第三季度\n\n简介：MELD 是 Cardano 上第一个用于借贷法定货币和加密货币的去中心化、非托管协议\n\n**[Aada](https://medium.com/@aada.finance)**\n\n简介：Aada 是 Cardano 上的加密资产借贷平台。智能合约允许存入资产并收取利息或借入资产并执行财务操作。\n\n**[Liqwid Finance](https://www.liqwid.finance/)**\n\n简介：个基于流动性提供者供应和借款人需求的利率曲线算法和非托管流动性协议。\n\n### 合成资产平台\n\n**[Indigo Protocol](https://indigoprotocol.io/)**\n\n上线时间：2021 年 10 月\n\n简介：Indigo 是一种基于 Cardano 的算法、自主合成协议，用于对现实世界资产进行链上价格敞口。\n\n### 衍生品市场\n\n**[Matrixswap](https://www.matrixswap.io/)**\n\n简介：是一个部署在 Polkadot、Cardano、Polygon 上的去中心化多链永续合约平台。\n\n### 去中心化保险\n\n**[Ensuro](https://ensuro.co/aboutus.html)**\n\n简介：未有更多进展。\n\n### NFT/ 链游\n\n**[Bondly （多链）](https://www.bondly.finance/default)**\n\n简介：Bondly 将通过加密项目、品牌和艺术家为下一代数字收藏品提供动力。\n\n**[Adazoo NFT](https://www.adazoo.com/)**\n\n上线时间：预计第三季度末\n\n简介：ADAZOO 是在 Cardano 区块链上运行的首批基于 NFT 的游戏之一。\n\n**[Cnft](https://cnft.io/)**\n\n简介：是 Cardano 上的 NFT 交易市场。\n\n**[Sushibytes](https://www.sushibyte.io/)**\n\n上线时间：预计 2021 年秋季\n\n简介：是在 Cardano 区块链上运行的首批基于 NFT 的游戏之一。\n\n**[Artano](https://artano.io/)**\n\n简介：是 Cardano 区块链上的一个全球社区驱动的 NFT 市场。\n\n参考资料：\n\n> 1.

IOHK\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zS2YzNw9tmwTTcfPYPyxE.png?height=1406&width=2500)\n\n### Cardano 的公链模型\n\nCardano 的模型通过创建扩展的 UTXO 模型（eUTXO）回归到行业的根源。它本质上是一个 UTXO，但具有两个附加功能——维护合约状态的能力和用于整个事务序列上的执行相同合约代码的能力。eUTXO 为交易添加了自定义数据和值，这允许任意逻辑与这些交易进行交互并打开智能合约的大门。\n\n### 共识机制\n\n#### 权益证明\n\nOuroboros 是一种基于权益证明 (PoS) 的加密货币免许可共识机制。它在 Cardano 区块链上实现，并带有一种称为 ADA 的加密货币。PoS 中的验证者不使用像 BTC 的 PoW 这样的矿工网络，而是使用他们的 ADA 股份参与验证和验证交易。\n\n所有做出贡献的验证者都会获得 ADA 奖励，而那些将其 ADA 代币委托给权益池的验证者也会获得与其权益相关的奖励。ADA 持有者可以参与对未来功能的投票，例如 Project Catalyst 投票。\n\nHydra(二层扩容方案) 是 Cardano 改变游戏规则的可扩展性解决方案，这意味着每秒交易 (TPS) 可高达 100 万。它借助 UTxO 技术使 Cardano 成为一个稳定的全球系统。\n\nCardano 量子证明使用 Sha-256 加密哈希函数，它允许任意长度的输入成为固定长度的输出。此外，输入是不可能从输出哈希中导出的。\n\n特别是，为了针对其他区块链上的速度和扩展问题提供最佳解决方案，Cardano 区块链分为两个主要层：\n\n* 结算层：该层的工作原理类似于包含由 Cardano PoS 协议验证的所有历史交易的分类帐。\n* 计算层：在卡尔达诺上运行的 DApp 层，实施智能合约。\n\n## 一些相关名词解释\n\n### Haskell\n\nHaskell是一种函数语言，对比于常用的 C/C++/Java/Python等 Imperative Langauge。 Imperative Language是以statement为主，把要做的工作描述在程序里，由电脑按步就班的执行。 Functional Language 是以构建函数为主，就像是数学证明一样，每一个函数会回复一些值（或函数），而函数可能参考到其他函数，由此组成完整的功能。\n\n### Plutus\n\nPlutus 是 Haskell 加上区块链和Smart Contract 的功能。\n\n## 生态系统\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EusR4HAlrkMXbeebKwVJt.png?height=1406&width=2500)\n\n### 基础设施\n\nAdapools 是一个基于网站的工具，用于监测池和分析卡尔达诺区块链的数据。ADApools 集成在 Yoroi Wallet 和 Daedalus Wallet 中，以方便用户。\n\nBlockfrost 是一个在 Cardano 区块链上提供 API 服务的基于 web 的平台。它消除了复杂性，因此客户可以在 Cardano 上创建自己的分散式应用程序。\n\n### 钱包\n\n* **Daedalus** ADA的开源钱包。目前，**Daedalus**是最流行的 ADA 存储方式。\n* **Yoroi Wallet** 是一款轻便的钱包。它是由 Emurgo 和 IOHK 设计和开发。此外，Yoroi 可以安装在许多网络浏览器上，iOS 和安卓。\n* **GeroWallet** 是一个运行在 Cardano 区块链上的钱包，允许用户交易，质押，利用合成资产，并直接用法定货币购买加密产品。2021年5月，GeroWallet 在 Cardstarter 上有一个成功的 IDO，该 IDO 的起始价格为0.008美元。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0qn5GND08d7dy958FzWPs.png?height=1406&width=2500)\n\n### 去中心化交易所\n\n**[Minswap](https://minswap.org/)**\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第四季度\n\n简介：2021 年 9 月 1 日，Cardno 测试网首先进行了阿朗佐硬分叉。不久之后，一个崭露头角的去中心化交易所「Minswap」于 9 月 3 日推出了他们的测试网，成为第一个部署在 Cardano 上的 Dapp。\n\n**[Cardaswap](https://cardaswap.finance/)**\n\n简介：在 Cardano 区块链上交换、赚取和构建下一代 DEX。在对所有人开放且可访问的金融市场中进行交易、搭建桥梁并成为流动性提供者。\n\n**[Cardax](https://cardax.io/)**\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第四季度\n\n简介：Cardax 是一个去中心化交易所，允许用户用 ADA 交易任何 Cardano 链上的原生代币。\n\n**[Yayswap](https://yayswap.io/)**\n\n跨链桥测试网：<https://yayswap.io/bridge/>\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第四季度\n\n简介：Cardano 区块链上的第一个高性能去中心化交易平台。\n\n**[Ergodex](https://ergodex.io/)**\n\n测试网：<https://beta.ergodex.io/>\n\n简介：ErgoDEX 是一个非托管的、去中心化的交易所，允许在 Ergo 和 Cardano 网络之间快速、轻松和安全地转移流动性。\n\n**[Adax](https://adax.pro/)**\n\n简介：ADAX 是一种自动化流动性协议，以完全去中心化和非托管的方式促进 Cardano 生态系统内的交易。\n\n**[Sundaeswap](https://www.sundaeswap.finance/)**\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第三季度\n\n简介：Cardano 区块链上的原生、可扩展的去中心化交易所\n\n### IDO平台\n\n* Cardstarter 是一个去中心化的加速器和swap平台，也是启动项目的启动平台。例如，Oracle Charli3 C3在 Cardstarter 上就是一个成功的 IDO。目前，许多突出的项目正在等待Cardstarter准备推出。\n* **OccamFi** 是一个为项目筹集资金的 IDO 平台。\n* TrustPad 是一个为初创公司提供的多链式筹款平台，支持各种区块链，如 Ethereum、 Binance Smart Chain、 Polygon、 Polkadot 和 Cardano。\n* 对于初创公司来说，Vent Finance 是一个理想的融资平台，它有一个易于使用的界面，无论用户之前在加密世界的经验如何。\n\n### 借贷\n\n**[Meld](https://www.meld.com/)**\n\n发布时间：预计 2021 年第三季度\n\n简介：MELD 是 Cardano 上第一个用于借贷法定货币和加密货币的去中心化、非托管协议\n\n**[Aada](https://medium.com/@aada.finance)**\n\n简介：Aada 是 Cardano 上的加密资产借贷平台。智能合约允许存入资产并收取利息或借入资产并执行财务操作。\n\n**[Liqwid Finance](https://www.liqwid.finance/)**\n\n简介：个基于流动性提供者供应和借款人需求的利率曲线算法和非托管流动性协议。\n\n### 稳定币\n\n不同于其他区块链，stablecoin 是在 Cardano 区块链上发布的**原生代币**，而不是通过智能合同。在不久的将来，虚拟货币市场将会有许多新型的用户需求的稳定币\n\n* **AgeUSD** 是一个稳定币，由 Emurgo、 Ergo 和 IOHK 在 Ergo 区块链上联合创建\n* **Ardana** 是一个 AMM DEX 专注于稳定币，它将发行加密货币支持的稳定币 dUSD，dEUR 等。它利用区块链技术应用于外汇市场。\n* **STASIS** Occam.Fi 上启动的一个项目，在 Cardano 区块链上为欧洲发行一种新型的稳定币。\n\n### 合成资产平台\n\n**[Indigo Protocol](https://indigoprotocol.io/)**\n\n上线时间：2021 年 10 月\n\n简介：Indigo 是一种基于 Cardano 的算法、自主合成协议，用于对现实世界资产进行链上价格敞口。\n\n### 衍生品市场\n\n**[Matrixswap](https://www.matrixswap.io/)**\n\n简介：是一个部署在 Polkadot、Cardano、Polygon 上的去中心化多链永续合约平台。\n\n### 去中心化保险\n\n**[Ensuro](https://ensuro.co/aboutus.html)**\n\n简介：未有更多进展。\n\n### NFT/ 链游\n\n* **[Bondly （多链）](https://www.bondly.finance/default)**\n\n简介：Bondly 将通过加密项目、品牌和艺术家为下一代数字收藏品提供动力。\n\n* **[Adazoo NFT](https://www.adazoo.com/)**\n\n上线时间：预计第三季度末\n\n简介：ADAZOO 是在 Cardano 区块链上运行的首批基于 NFT 的游戏之一。\n\n* **[Cnft](https://cnft.io/)**\n\n简介：是 Cardano 上的 NFT 交易市场。\n\n* **[Sushibytes](https://www.sushibyte.io/)**\n\n上线时间：预计 2021 年秋季\n\n简介：是在 Cardano 区块链上运行的首批基于 NFT 的游戏之一。\n\n* **[Artano](https://artano.io/)**\n\n简介：是 Cardano 区块链上的一个全球社区驱动的 NFT 市场。\n\n* THEOS 是一家初创公司，为客户提供创建自己的 NFT 的服务;\n\n参考资料：\n\n> 1.

Historically it looks like NFTs will catch up shortly; making this a good entry point.\n* Coinbase will launch their NFT platform. This will be a major catalyst to the industry. If Coinbase does to NFTs what they did to BTC in 2013, this will bring millions of new people to the market. Blue chip projects will be most appealing.\n* CC is all about community. I am part of > 50 discord channels. This is the one where I met the nicest people and where I consistently get the most value from.\n* The team is not focused on floor prices but on driving more holders to the project and building an ecosystem. The token-holder ratio is close to 50% and growing. \n* The art is family friendly, making it appealing to tons of brand partnerships.\n* Roadmap is by far the most exciting ($MILK, $GOLD, pets, gamifaction, gametheory). This hints towards a Pokemon-style NFT ecosystem.\n\n### What could go wrong?\n\n* Collectibles / PFP die as a whole. I do not expect NFTs in general to go away. \n* The CC team decides to stop working on the project. They don’t have a fiduciary duty or other legal obligations towards the project. I don’t expect the project to be able to survive at the absence of the team (unlike Cryptopunks or generative art projects).\n\n### Assets Purchased\n\nthose cats are listed at the floor and available for purchase at the time of writing.\n\n[https://opensea.io/assets/0x1a92f7381b9f03921564a437210bb9396471050c/7631](https://opensea.io/assets/0x1a92f7381b9f03921564a437210bb9396471050c/7631)\n\n[https://opensea.io/assets/0x1a92f7381b9f03921564a437210bb9396471050c/6653](https://opensea.io/assets/0x1a92f7381b9f03921564a437210bb9396471050c/6653)\n\n[https://opensea.io/assets/0x1a92f7381b9f03921564a437210bb9396471050c/806](https://opensea.io/assets/0x1a92f7381b9f03921564a437210bb9396471050c/806)\n\n[https://opensea.io/assets/0x1a92f7381b9f03921564a437210bb9396471050c/9250](https://opensea.io/assets/0x1a92f7381b9f03921564a437210bb9396471050c/9250)\n\n[https://opensea.io/assets/0x1a92f7381b9f03921564a437210bb9396471050c/3624](https://opensea.io/assets/0x1a92f7381b9f03921564a437210bb9396471050c/3624)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635165621, "digest": "OjlHDlr6v6kQGLYJQYF5X_oHkWFNIYwPPAHlIqaVDaM", "contributor": "0xA94d2A9e36f87DBa42845218EB88497574640028"}
{"id": "WNqZSLLXlVV3XO-01PnUgBJdCtewGGjUp6Z1N-6qiZE", "title": "MEV谁能称王", "body": "一.Eden Network\n\nEDEN2.0做了什么？首先是取消了 100 EDEN 质押使用节点的限制，引入了 SEV\n\n什么是 SEV？它是质押者可提取价值，这是质押者可以赚取并提取到他们钱包的价值。EDEN 将使用backrunning（回溯）和套利来提取价值并将其返回给社区。\n\n假设你在 sushiswap 上进行交易，产生了套利空间。EDEN的MEV机器人通过节点的帮助获取这部分利润，将这部分利润分给交易者和质押者。\n\n对于交易者和质押者来说，使用 Eden RPC 不仅可以防止三明治攻击，而且还提供了取回 ETH 的机会。不仅是反恶意 MEV，还有额外收入，这来自于返利，额外的回报。\n\n二.Alchemist-mistX\n\nmistX 是一个无 Gas 费的去中心化交易所，通过 Flashbots 绑定交易，实现交易确认。mistX 在链上作为交易搜索者，Flashbots 将 mistX 直接与矿工连接，保护用户发起的交易信息不会发布到公开的内存池（mempool），而是以捆绑交易的形式进入 Flashbots 系统。其他交易搜索者无法抢跑、夹击该用户的交易，因为捆绑交易总是位于区块的顶部。用户有效地隐藏了交易信息，使其不被抢跑者发现，从而防止交易被操纵，为矿工的争夺利益提供了公平的竞争环境，是第一个可以让普通用户使用 Flashbots 的应用。\n\n通过 mistX 处理的以太坊交易不需要用户提供任何 Gas 费（Transaction Fee, Gas Price 都为 0 Ether）。当一笔交易发生时，小费将被确定并作为交易中的一部分价值通过智能合约调用被提交支付给矿工，用户不需要确保钱包中持有足够的 ETH 支付 Gas 费用。如果交易失败或者用户因任何原因取消交易，都不需要支付任何 Gas 费，给矿工的小费也将被退回。\n\n每一笔通过 mistX 支付的矿工小费，都会保留其中一部分给 mistX 平台，用于支持 Alchemist 生态系统。\n\n核心的 Crucible NFT 和 crucible.alchemist.wft 上相连的 Aludal 奖励池。通过 crucible.wft 订阅 MIST-ETH LP 意味着 Alchemists 在 mistX.io 交易时可以获得奖励。因此，在 mistX 上进行的代币交易会对 $MIST 的价格有直接影响。这种好处不仅奖励 mistX 用户，而且奖励了 Alchemist 社区和所有 $MIST 持有者。\n\nmistX.io 对以太坊区块链产生了积极的影响，减少了网络拥堵，促进了效率；通过不将失败的交易纳入区块，不对失败的交易收取 Gas 费，以释放区块空间。\n\nmistX 9 月底更新了新功能，用户在适用的交易中能获得现金返还的奖励，同时，未成功的交易可以免费取消。用户使用 mistX 进行交易时，在交易执行的同时钱包中就能收到 ETH 返还，mistX 把套利所得利润的 40% 用于用户返还，52.5% 用于支付套利交易的成本，另外 7.5% 给 Alchemist，这 7.5% 中的一半用于给 Aludel 奖励计划，10% 给多重签名，40% 给产品团队。\n\nmistX 的交易不需要支付 Gas 费，但需要支付手续费，包含一部分 mistX 保护费用，这部分费用的目的是保护交易不受三明治攻击以及取消费用和失败的成本以及给矿工的小费。此外还有 ETH 基本费用（Base Fee），这是由网络本身决定的，随后被销毁，还有一部分给流动性提供者。\n\n三.Cowswap\n\n作为 DEX，当两个交易者各自持有对方想要的资产时，订单可以在他们之间直接结算，无需外部做市商或流动性提供者的操作。用户的订单由求解器（Solver）发送，并设置了严格的滑点区间，求解器相互竞争，为用户争取最优惠的价格。\n\n与其他解决方案相比 - Flashbots RPC 需要额外的 gas，并且不提供回滚回报。使用 Cowswap，你只能在他们的 DEX 上进行交易，你需要支付双重手续费（部分支付给他们的平台，一部分支付给流动性平台）你不会获得返利。这也是这个项目最大的问题。\n\n抗 MEV 的去中心化交易协议，也是 mev 赛道上比较新的一个项目，CowSwap 有一个新的交易模式，CowSwap 上允许用户利用需求匹配 (Coincidence of Wants，CoW) 的方式撮合交易，为用户寻找最好的 rate 和价格，目前有 7 亿美金的交易量。亮点在于：\n\n1、保护用户被 mev 攻击；\n\n2、具有网络效应，交易者越多得到的价格就会越好，有一个正向飞轮效应；\n\n3、能够很好地服务用户，目前对他们来说最大的挑战是如何吸引更大的用户量。\n\n四.最后\n\n根据flashbots的数据，从2020年1月1日到现在，累计mev价值有7.24亿美金，如果能够将此利用起来，将获得大量的资本和用户\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bZIsyT2Pdgs9W5il88f7k.png?height=495&width=833)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635166055, "digest": "q7sGF0WlP9XOTSrnOLPAb-2CDP6sr7ibA6Li1QaRNTM", "contributor": "0xe8d533FD66C1726c8f6CddC7c64a17F4D8FaC404"}

{"id": "gj0FE853HZdMD7tWb-N7aqpO2PDd8gZG5yAe9lV30aM", "title": "My life as a blogger", "body": "The blogger-friendly motto has always been, \"Work from anywhere.\" And these days, it's easier than it's ever been to do so. With just a mobile phone in your hands, blogging has become much easier than ever. This flexibility to work anywhere and anytime you want is exactly the kind of lifestyle I dream of a time ago.\n\nHowever, the flip side of having the freedom to work anywhere and anytime is — well — there is no such thing as time or place as it pertains to work. And as a writer, this means that no matter where you are or what you're doing, you must always be prepared to write. If not, you risk losing those good ideas and subjects that you come across only occasionally.\n\nMy life as a blogger is filled with a lot of work and a little bit of play. Imagine a life where you spend a considerable amount of time sitting around a pool table, drinking coffee, sometimes watching movies, and writing about whatever comes to mind. That's my life. Plus, I have the freedom to work from anywhere there's an available WiFi connection. Thus, my work office is everywhere from the café down the street to a pool hall or my barbershop. Like I am typing this sitting beside the driver in a car.\n\nOf course, this is a bit easier said than done. Especially when you consider the many things that I'm constantly juggling. There is my day job, my family, my friends, my blog, my freelance writing gigs. And the list goes on. I still try to be as productive as possible no matter where I am or what I'm doing, but this is rarely an easy task (though I’m getting better at it).\n\nI wake up every morning at 5 am, roll out of bed, do my regular 30 minutes prayers and devotion, and turn on my mobile phone. I sit down with a cup of coffee and get to work. I work from my mobile phone because that's typically where I'll be when I get an idea for a blog post. More often than not, I'm at home on the couch when this happens. And on days when I don't have a blog post in mind, I’ll usually check my email and see if something is interesting going on in the world or my inbox that I can comment on.\n\nI discovered that the best thing to do is to \"live like a writer.\" That means, make your living space and your workspace as similar as possible (not an easy feat if you live in a studio apartment and work from a laptop).\n\nThis means — for me — there is no wall between where I sleep and where I blog. I also prefer to work out of my pajamas instead of having a predetermined outfit that is appropriate for work. This way, as I write, I can simply go about my business as if I'm not working. Since the atmosphere is less rigid, it makes it easier for me to write without feeling as if I'm stuck in a cubicle somewhere. It makes the working process much more organic and natural and it has definitely enhanced my productivity and effectiveness as a blogger.\n\nThere are some definite perks to working for myself. I can wake up whenever I want, choose my clothes, work wherever I want, and even eat whatever I want. When I feel like working out, I can simply go to the local football playground and kill a few hours watching local games. This is also helpful to get back your mojo for writing the next story. But as with any job, it can also be a bit stressful at times.\n\nBut the biggest difference between my life as a blogger and a typical 9-5 is that, as a blogger, there is no wall between where I sleep and where I blog. In fact, it’s sometimes hard to differentiate one from the other. Working from home is great in that sense because my schedule is entirely my own. Since there isn’t a cube farm to worry about, I can simply go about my business as if I'm not working.\n\nSurprisingly, blogging has more in common with acting than writing. Because I am a lover of language and words, I'd like to think that writing comes naturally to me, and it does. But it's not that easy. The one thing that most people don't know is that I'm a huge introvert. It's something that I've struggled with for years, so when I decided to start blogging, I was skeptical. But when I went all in to it, it eventually became so much more than just a hobby or part-time job. Blogging is now my full-time job.\n\nBlogging has impacted my life in so many more ways than I could ever imagine. From the time I started blogging, I've been able to focus on my personal growth and develop my personal life, relationship, and financial life. At first scrutiny, it may seem like I'm still in diapers, and it's true. However, as I continue to blog, gain more experience, continue my relationship with fellow bloggers, and gain confidence in the ways I expand my potentials, then slowly but surely I have gained maturity in the way I now work.\n\nMy personal life and relationship have much been impacted since I started blogging. This is because I do not only write, I read more than I write, interesting articles about life, relationship, and finance are all over the places for all to read. I now live a peaceful and relaxing life away from the usual bubble and bustle life. My love life has improved much tremendously because the more I write the more I want to be more of what I wrote.\n\nI couldn't be more satisfied in any area of my life with blogging than my financial life. The impact of cryptocurrency and BCH, in particular, is so huge for me, enabling me to plant seeds that would grow up to become financial trees for me and my family to safely rest under its fruitful shield.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI've learned a lot about myself through blogging and as a result, feel more confident about my future and career, especially if I can continue with this growth. As you grow, you also become more independent and can now do things on your own, instead of relying on a man to provide you with financial advice. And because of the many things that I learn and the different areas that you can too, this allows me the ability to get the most out for myself and my family.\n\nThrough blogging, I am able and willing to do more, not just write but share, grow and learn in a way that is far more beneficial for my health, happiness, and relationships with others. From my experience, blogging has been scrutiny, as well as criticism, in regards to my behavior, relationships, actions, thoughts, and emotions. In turn, it has taught me a lot of things about myself, about relationships, and about life itself. Blogging has allowed me more freedom in relationships as a man, being able more fully to express myself.

After completing their testnet, you can get a role in their discord server. Go to #bot-commands and type !join. You will be asked to verify your wallet.\n\nAngle Knowledge Quiz\nThey have also released two quizzes about your knowledge of Angle Protocol. (The third one is coming soon.)\nPart 1: <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddUD8rNRBNvPHJN15DvPT9Lbglu5-M_iGQU_PGD4wchvHnLg/viewform?usp=sf_link>\nPart 2: <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScK7dZtSHQUg3zEoLFP27-2M92Bpl6AUOiOi-WEc62gkvaPcw/viewform?usp=sf_link>\nPart 3: To be released……\nYou can find the answers by looking at their documentation.\nOR\nYou can look at my answers for reference.

Therefore, Enryakuji Temple is a historically and culturally important place, and it once had possessed far more cultural properties and historical documents than are still in existence.\n\nBut the enormous cultural properties and historical documents of Enryakuji Temple suffered damage from [the Siege of Mount Hiei in 1571](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Mount_Hiei) and much of these were lost. Currently, there are only a few historical documents that can tell us what the precincts of Enryakuji Temple in the past looked like.\n\n*Sanmon-Santō Sakamoto Sōezu* is probably the most detailed pictorial old maps of the precincts of Enryakuji Temple in existence and also shows the halls of temples and shrines that may have existed before [1571](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Mount_Hiei).\\[8\\] Therefore, these maps are valuable historical documents to know about what the precincts in the past looked like.\n\n### Repository\n\nCurrently, these maps are one of the collections in [the National Archives of Japan (NAJ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Archives_of_Japan).

我们都是穷尽自己仅有的一点天赋，来表达内心深处的感受。——乔布斯\n\n`本期内容YouTube链接：`\n\n[https://youtu.be/RfjAqQMCBmk](https://youtu.be/RfjAqQMCBmk)\n\n`本期内容哔哩哔哩链接：`\n\n[https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Bv411u7LY/](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Bv411u7LY/)\n\n我们在早前为大家介绍过Avalanche上的一站式交易平台Trader Joe。\n\n他通过把交易场景聚合的方式，\n\n得到了众多用户的青睐。\n\n如果我们把Trader Joe看做是雪崩协议上的一个中央银行，\n\n那今天我们要为大家介绍的项目：**[Penguin Finance](https://penguinfinance.org/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=linktree&utm_campaign=website)（下简称Pefi）**\n\n他则更像是围绕在银行边的一个热闹集市。\n\n通证：PEFI\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lk4GP6zj6QOTsB0SUb3FH.png?height=838&width=2500)\n\n## PEFI是什么？\n\n### 雪崩协议上的游戏与金融中心\n\nPefi给自己的定义是：雪崩协议上游戏化的去中心化金融中心。\n\n因此我们可以从金融和游戏两个角度来介绍Pefi。\n\n**金融方面：**\n\n不管外表的包装，\n\nPefi的底层功能跟很多AMM产品一样，\n\n提供流动性挖矿、Swap、质押等功能。\n\n在金融方面，他主要的特点有三个：\n\n**1-因为Pefi不属于Dex，因此你其实不能在平台直接进行swap，而需要跳转到Pangolin。**\n\n> Pangolin是雪崩协议上另一个Defi协议\n\n**2-因为Pefi接入了Pangolin和Joe的流动性池，所以在Pefi添加流动性，你将获得三倍的收益。**\n\n> 具体的原理我们将在下文进行解释。\n\n**3-抵押Pefi得到的iPEFI具备更多实用性，还能参与Launchpad以及下方的游戏内容。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qIF6DVtOzR9wyOfYRTszF.png?height=781&width=1014)\n\n**游戏方面：**\n\n大多数去中心化金融产品对于游戏的延伸就是做相关的NFT。\n\n组成战队，战队有积分，积分由NFT贡献，\n\n最终战队积分高者获得奖励。\n\n与他们不同的是，\n\nPefi设计了自己的游戏玩法。\n\n\\*\\*1-Emperor：\\*\\*每个玩家可以拥有自己的小企鹅，并通过竞标的方式，让自己的企鹅坐上王位。\n\n最终谁做的王位时间越久，谁获得最终的iPEFI奖励。同时，如果你的竞标失败，竞标费用中的97.5%将物归原主，2%进入到游戏的奖励池，0.5%最终将分配给持有iPEFI的用户。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OOJa7ZC4oADNhTaPo_qRx.png?height=611&width=1280)\n\n\\*\\*2-Arena：\\*\\*这不是一个游戏，而是一个游戏的集合，在这里你能通过游戏获得PEFI的奖励，同时游戏中收集的手续费也将给到iPEFI持有者。\n\n目前这个板块正在开发中，\n\n但对于团队而言，已将这个板块视作整个Pefi的心脏。\n\n如果你对这个项目感兴趣，Arena的推出将是项目方很重要的一个里程碑。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oAhQF7M-RMzQLMVlT9Hdc.png?height=354&width=762)\n\n不管是金融产品的游戏化，\n\n还是推出更多原生的游戏玩法，\n\n其目的都指向一个：用户的拉新促活。\n\n整体而言，不管是金融还是游戏，\n\n虽然在两个细分赛道里Pefi目前都不能算最优，\n\n但你却不能说Pefi没有自己有优势，以及自己独有的成长潜力。\n\n## PEFI有什么潜力？\n\n### 利用更高的利润吸引用户\n\n金融产品吸引用户的核心方式之一是高利润率。\n\nPefi也不例外。\n\n简单来讲，\n\n当你单独在Pangolin或者Trader Joe添加流动性时，\n\n你除了获得流动性池本身的激励外，还将获得PNG或者JOE的激励。\n\n**这是第1⃣️层收益。**\n\n而Pefi通过与Pangolin和Trader Joe进行合作，\n\n让你通过Pefi参与后两者的流动性池，\n\n在你获得原生的PNG或者JOE奖励后，\n\n你还将获得PEFI的奖励。\n\n**这是第2⃣️层收益。**\n\n同时，因为PEFI可以通过质押换得iPEFI，\n\n从而分享项目交互过程中的手续费，\n\n在流动性池中你还可以开启自动质押的功能，\n\n将收益继续复利。\n\n**这是第3⃣️层收益。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NmCF3rZShj8wwSitZidXw.png?height=841&width=1176)\n\nPefi将自己第二代流动性挖矿产品称作：Igloos，\n\n并以独有的**三倍收益**吸引用户。\n\n### 将金融游戏化，而不失实用性\n\n当你完整体验完Pefi的产品后，\n\n你可能会有一个感受：产品的各个地方都有些游戏的影子。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/w__X6HDXaA0u7ZKb4EZea.png?height=595&width=1280)\n\n**对于项目方而言：**\n\n游戏只是手段，\n\n更多的是想留住用户。\n\n**对于当前的用户而言：**\n\n到你平台来也不是为了玩游戏，\n\n更多是为了获得收益。\n\n而项目方做的比较好的一点是，\n\n所有的游戏都跟PEFI及iPEFI有关。\n\n玩家在玩游戏的过程中还能得到相关的收益。\n\n同时Pefi在近期也拿到了Avalanche的RUSH计划，\n\n继续推动着项目方在游戏方向及layer2方向的发展。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PMiOzENfpY9VWWkEGreRU.png?height=852&width=1280)\n\n官方的支持，\n\n自然会为项目方带来更多的资源倾斜，\n\n以及更多曝光机会。\n\n## PEFI有什么风险？\n\n### 金融乐高，风险加倍\n\n对于金融产品而言，\n\n利用自身通证奖励而提高利润率的方式并不少见。\n\n但可能很多朋友也吃过相关的亏。\n\n除了平台本身的安全风险外，\n\n因为高利润率的来源是平台自身的通证奖励。\n\n而当平台自身的通证价值下降时，\n\n你的利润率也是随之下降的。\n\nPefi是一个从今年4月开始的项目，\n\n从产品整体的设计以及白皮书来看。\n\n虽然他看起来不像是一个不正经的项目，\n\n但Pefi从8月的最高点到现在，市值已经缩水了75%以上。\n\n所以当你把原生通证的下跌风险，\n\n以及产品的安全风险一起考虑时，\n\n也许你才能得到自己心中真正的答案。\n\n### 社区驱动能否在资本世界走通\n\n除了以上的风险外，\n\n另一个是关于通证分配的比例问题。\n\n严格意义上来讲，这可能不算是风险，\n\n更像是让你提前降低一些预期。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2J6Al-ELXiQZkmyrVevtR.png?height=720&width=1280)\n\n在PEFI的通证分配中，\n\n有非常明显的社区导向。\n\n分配比例里没有提前的融资额度，\n\n也没有为资方的后期进入预留一定比例。\n\n整个项目的发展，基本完全由社区驱动。\n\n相比于之前为大家介绍的Trader Joe不同，\n\n后者由一众大佬站台，风光璀璨。\n\n而Pefi则更像是围绕在大佬身边的小企鹅。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hgVgDtyYKh63EYCrsG7IS.png?height=397&width=710)\n\n也许他看起来并不会那么风光华丽，\n\n可一旦小企鹅数量壮大了，\n\n也是一个不可忽视的群众力量。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mKfOmQHIx-gF-X3iKRVhE.png?height=796&width=1430)\n\n>

{"id": "wgFF9s0J8SqlqMsy1RuKwJuamVMoOyfZ_4EW7d7HfKI", "title": "So what is DeFi 2.0? (Part 1)", "body": "If you've been active in the crypto social media community in the last few months, you probably have seen the term \"DeFi 2.0\" mentioned numerous times, as it is quickly becoming a meme to define the difference between traditional DeFi protocols of the past several years and the nascent protocols that are exploding in popularity across various ecosystems. So what does \"2.0\" mean? Before we discuss what these new DeFi protocols are attempting to do, let's discuss the current state of DeFi in 2021 and what the status quo is for decentralized economics. Once we have laid the foundation for DeFi, we'll take a look at a few projects that are aiming to flip the status quo on its head and push new boundaries in financial products in the cryptosphere.\n\n\n---\n\n## Introduction to DeFi\n\nDecentralized Finance is just that - financial protocols governed and operating upon a decentralized computing network such as a blockchain. The vast majority of protocols operate on the Ethereum blockchain, though many other blockchain protocols boast their own set of DeFi tools. DeFi can mean many things, but it usually revolves around the concept of the transaction of cryptocurrencies between two or more parties without any intermediary or centralized institution. This is often performed through decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, that utilize smart contracts to facilitate transactions automatically and securely via a mechanism called an [Automated Market Maker (AMM)](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm). Let's discuss the various forms of DeFi that you're likely to encounter.\n\n## DeFi 1.0:\n\n\"DeFi 1.0\" is actually a new term that refers to traditional DeFi mechanisms that allow decentralized exchanges to operate smoothly. In order to prevent buyers or sellers from having to find counterparties to a transaction, most DeFi protocols use liquidity pools which consist of pooled (AKA \"staked\") funds that are locked into a smart contract by users to automatically provide the counterparty to a specific trade. For example, if I were to try to trade Ethereum for the dollar-pegged stablecoin USDT via a DEX, the DEX would deposit my ETH into the pool and withdraw an equivalent amount of USDT from the other pool, instead of manually finding a buyer for my ETH. Those who stake funds into these pools are rewarded with a portion of the transaction fees, among other rewards. However, in order for staking funds to be a profitable venture, the transaction volume must be high enough to provide sufficient profit to all **liquidity providers (LPs)**, which is often not the case. This has led to exchanges offering additional rewards on top of a portion of the fees, leading to a practice known as \"yield farming.\"\n\n**Yield Farming:**\n\nIn order to incentivize staking, many protocols offer additional rewards beyond transaction fees, often called \"yield.\" Similar to the interest you earn when you deposit cash into a traditional bank, DeFi protocols offer yield to LPs that is often derived from the value of their proprietary token. One problem with this incentive is that it requires the value of the token to continue to grow and remain profitable, otherwise yield will go down until LPs begin to withdraw their funds. LPs understand that yields are inherently volatile and unsustainable in the long run, and \"rotate\" their funds through various liquidity pools to maximize profits. The act of rotating funds across various pools and claiming rewards is often referred to as [\"yield farming\"](https://www.certik.org/blog/whats-the-difference-between-staking-yield-farming-and-liquidity-mining)  and has both the risk of [impermanent loss](https://blog.liquid.com/impermanent-loss#:\\~:text=Impermanent%20loss%20is%20one%20of,change%20is%20your%20impermanent%20loss.), a situation where the current value of your staked position is lower than the value of your tokens had you not staked them (which becomes permanent loss if you withdraw from the liquidity pool), as well as negative effects for the network as capital flight leads to volatility.\n\nThese problems are well-known and many DeFi protocols have been combating them with various mechanisms, including lock-up periods which prevent LPs from withdrawing their tokens for a pre-defined period of time. Protocols can also issue what are called LP tokens, or tokens that represent a staked position in a liquidity pool. These tokens can be collateralized (borrowed against) to enter new positions in a mechanism called \"looping\" in which LPs leverage their staked positions to enter new liquidity pools, further compounding their profits. Like all forms of leverage, this increases the risk to the LP and can lead to volatility across numerous exchanges as positions are either liquidated or withdrawn, cascading throughout the network.\n\n**Liquidity Mining:**\n\nAnother mechanism exchanges use to incentivize staking is providing stakers with their own token, such as UNI for the Uniswap DEX. Not only do stakers earn profits from transaction fees, but can slowly accrue the exchange's own token (or any token that the exchange decides to reward stakers with). One major problem with **liquidity mining** is that it is inherently unsustainable: either the exchange mints unlimited tokens (leading to inflation), or the exchange runs out of tokens to provide its stakers (the rewards disappear over time). Most new exchanges incentivize liquidity mining to \"bootstrap\" their operations (to get things started), and are open about the fact that the rewards won't last forever. However this simple fact leads liquidity providers to rotate their funds, similar to yield farming, and could lead to an exchange growing rapidly and **unsustainably**, and then collapsing in the near future.\n\n**DAO centralization:**\n\nAside from the financial pitfalls of liquidity renting, providing LPs with rewards in the form of proprietary tokens takes on an additional risk to the stability of the market when these tokens also serve as governance tokens, as with the UNI token. Uniswap is a protocol that is (partially) governed by a **DAO**, or [Decentralized Autonomous Organization](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/what-is-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-and-how-does-a-dao-work). For example, holders of the UNI token are afforded the ability to vote on changes to the protocol, similar to owners of shares of companies having the right to vote in shareholder meetings. When a DEX is governed by a DAO and voting rights within the DAO are afforded proportionally to the amount of tokens an individual holds, power can concentrate into the hands of the wealthy few. This reduces the decentralization of the network and centralizes power, undermining the purpose of a decentralized protocol.\n\nGiven enough influence in the network, these token holders can vote for changes to the DAO that enrich themselves, such as paying higher rewards for staking more funds. Since those with more tokens get more votes, these \"whales\" can extract wealth from the protocol, enriching themselves and exploiting the DEX users as liquidity to dump tokens on before leaving the liquidity pool altogether to enter a new one with higher rewards. This becomes less and less feasible as the network grows large, but as new protocols emerge they must take special care to prevent whales from undermining the network by entering too early.\n\n\n---\n\n## DeFi 2.0:\n\n\"DeFi 2.0\" aims to address many of these inherent problems with unsustainability in DeFi. While the term is nascent and somewhat of a meme, it indicates a shift from past mechanisms and incentives to reward LPs to new forms of providing liquidity to markets that are more sustainable. DeFi 2.0 protocols refer to these past mechanisms as \"liquidity renting\" as it involves exchanges paying LPs to remain staked in their respective pools. In essence, the exchange is \"renting\" the liquidity to create a market. Furthermore, by issuing governance tokens as rewards the protocol can theoretically undermine and doom itself to the control of a few wealthy individuals or groups at a very early stage. Therefore, new DeFi protocols must engineer new mechanisms that either prevent whales from overwhelming the protocol at an early stage, or incentivize benevolent behavior. There are numerous new DeFi protocols that are pushing boundaries and building sandbox ecosystems, and while everything in crypto is still very \"experimental,\" some are more popular and reputable than others. Let's take a look at one of the biggest players so far…\n\n## Olympus and \"Proof of Bonding\"\n\n[Olympus](www.olympusdao.finance) is a new DeFi protocol that aims to become a **free-floating reserve currency** within the cryptocurrency DeFi ecosystem via a proprietary token (OHM) and unique algorithmic features. Olympus was launched in March 2021 with little fanfare, allowing early supporters to purchase OHM bonds in exchange for OHM-DAI LP tokens, which is tokenized collateral for staking DAI, a dollar-pegged algorithmic stablecoin governed by [MakerDAO](www.makerdao.com). Since then, OlympusDAO has begun accepting other forms of payment in exchange for **OHM bonds** including the stablecoin FRAX and wrapped Ether tokens (wETH), allowing the protocol to build a treasury backed by a basket of diverse crypto-assets.\n\nOne of Olympus' primary selling points is that it claims to be free from the inflation of the USD peg, even though most of its treasury is denominated in USD-pegged stablecoins. However, OlympusDAO claims that the free-floating value of OHM allows the marketplace to decide the true value of OHM, and that over time the algorithmic mechanisms will lead the price to stabilize. OHM tokens can be staked by the user to earn rewards in the form of sOHM, a token that is created when OHM is staked, and burned to create new OHM tokens when withdrawn. The rewards provided to stakers are derived from the profits that come from the sale of OHM bonds. So how does Olympus' bonding work?\n\n### Bonding\n\nOlympus differentiates itself from other AMM protocols in that it functions as a monetary creation layer, and not a liquidity provision layer. Instead of providing liquidity for people to transact tokens back and forth, Olympus aims to create new value purely through market demand for its free-floating currency. Remember, OHM can be both created AND destroyed, so the token is neither strictly inflationary or deflationary. Let's see how Olympus creates value:\n\n**Example:**\n\nOlympus acquires value by selling \"bonds\" in exchange for various crypto-assets, primarily the stablecoin DAI (for now). These bonds vest incrementally over a period of approximately 5 days (although changes to the vesting schedule are being discussed for the upcoming Olympus v2 launch), slowly unlocking the OHM token to the bond holder to prevent the buyer from immediately selling the bond for a quick profit.\n\nLet's assume that the OHM token is currently trading at $500, which you can purchase at various decentralized exchanges. The Olympus protocol does not use [oracles](https://chain.link/) to determine the market price of OHM and set the price of bonds, instead it relies entirely on market demand and arbitrage to allow the price of bonds to naturally fluctuate. Over time, the price of bonds slowly drops lower and lower until a buyer is found - let's say the price drops down to $450, a 10% discount from the market price of OHM. A buyer purchases one (1) bond for $450 in DAI, the $450 goes straight into the treasury, and every 8 hours for 15 epochs approximately 0.0667 OHM will appear in the buyer's wallet. After 15 epochs, the full 1.0 OHM has been vested, and the buyer can do as he or she pleases with the token.\n\nBecause a buyer has been found, the algorithm raises the price of the next bond sale slightly to account for the increase in demand. Technically the price of bonds can raise to a value higher than the market value of OHM + the rewards of staking over 5 days (approximately 6.29% at this moment), although there is no benefit to buying a bond above the OHM market value and presumably the lack of demand for above-market value bonds will cause the price of bonds to fall below the price of OHM on the market again until another buyer is found.\n\n### Staking and Rewards\n\nThose who have heard of Olympus were probably first attracted to the project via its enormous **yield rates**. At the time of this writing, the annual percentage yield (APY) of staked OHM tokens is approximately 8,400%, an incredibly high number even for DeFi projects. But what does this number mean?\n\nAs bonds are sold, OHM is minted and the profits are deposited into the treasury, which is governed by the DAO. OlympusDAO is responsible for managing the finances of the Olympus treasury, and sets the monetary policy for Olympus. We will talk a bit later about OlympusDAO and its various functions, but for now all you need to know is that the rewards are determined by the community in votes proposed by the policy team of OlympusDAO.\n\nThe profits from the sale of bonds is what is used to pay rewards to stakers at the rate determined by OlympusDAO. Over time, the goal is to slowly but steadily reduce yield rewards to stakers as the market cap of OHM grows, leading to more stability in the price of the OHM token. As the yield drops, the demand for OHM to stake will go down, leading to fewer bond sales and lower emissions. However, unlike traditional DeFi 1.0 protocols that reward stakers by minting new tokens out of thin air, OHM stakers are rewarded with OHM tokens that are backed by the revenue coming in via bond sales. Therefore the inflationary effect is dampened significantly. Remember, every OHM is intrinsically backed by at least $1, however at the time of writing due to the treasury's assets every OHM has a rough backing of about $167.\n\nOver time, the policy team at OlympusDAO will continue to propose votes to lower the yield rewards to maintain stability of the protocol. As bonding slows down (as it is expected to do), the sustainability of high yield percentages will begin to decay. The runway - a term for the number of days current yield rewards can be maintained if bond sales stop entirely - is also expected to grow as the protocol matures. At the time of this writing, the current runway for 8400% yield is 313 days, meaning the OHM protocol in its current state and yield % can hypothetically continue to pay out rewards for almost a year.\n\n**What happens if there is a run on the bank?**\n\nIn the hypothetical situation in which the vast majority of participants unstake their OHM and sell it on the market, a few interesting things will happen. First, let's assume that in this situation the pool begins with 1,000,000 staked OHM tokens, and 95% of these tokens are withdrawn leaving 50,000 OHM tokens in the staking pool. Secondly, let's assume that bonding completely stops and no new revenue flows into Olympus. Finally, let's assume that the remaining stakers (who collectively own 50,000 OHM tokens) purchased their OHM for $1000. The total value of the remaining staked pool would be:\n\n> 50,000 x $1,000 = $50,000,000\n\nAs of 22 October, 2021 the total OHM supply is 3,787,510 tokens and the risk-free value (the value of the USD-backed stablecoins in the treasury, called RFV) is $128,535,911. Since only $3.7m of the risk-free value needs to back each token by the protocol, the remaining RFV will be used to pay out rewards to the stakers. This means that:\n\n> $128,535,911 - $3,787,510 = $124,748,401\n\nin rewards are yet to be paid out (over time) to the remaining stakers. If these remaining stakers stay staked in the OHM pool, they would continue to earn rewards that far outvalue their initial investment. Once the treasury is depleted, the remaining stakers who didn't withdraw during the bank run will have seen the total value of their assets go from $50m to almost $125m, approximately a 2.5x  (150%) return on investment. Therefore it is impossible for remaining stakers to lose money by staying in the protocol.\n\nThis scenario is also highly unlikely to play out, as when other people see the enormous rewards being given to the remaining stakers, they will begin to purchase OHM on the market, thereby reducing supply and driving the price back up. Furthermore, because no bonds have been sold (remember our previous assumption), the discount of OHM tokens provided to bond buyers will continue to grow to a point where OHM gets so cheap and the spread between the market value and the price of the bond grows so large that the incentive to re-enter the market will emerge, leading to price stabilization. Therefore, stakers have little to worry about if the price of OHM fluctuates or if a significant portion of stakers withdraw their funds.\n\n**The Future of Olympus**\n\nThere is far more to Olympus that what was mentioned above, and a true deep-dive requires far more than a single newsletter, but for now I'll leave you with this: Olympus is the first mover in a truly interesting new direction for DeFi in that they seem to have created a sustainable model for a free-floating currency that is not only backed by various high-quality crypto-assets but is also resilient to volatility and bank runs. It will be very interesting to see what sort of Olympus copycats, derivatives, and forks occur in the future.\n\n**How do I stake OHM and start earning rewards?** You will, like many other protocols, need a Metamask wallet with some crypto (probably ETH) and you should head to a good DEX such as <https://app.sushiswap.com> and exchange your ETH for OHM. Once you have your OHM, head on over to <https://app.olympusdao.finance> and follow the very simple instructions for staking your tokens. Your rewards are compounded automatically, so there's no need to visit every day to collect your rewards and you can withdraw at any time.\n\nSee <https://www.olympusdao.finance/> to get started.\n\n## Other DeFi 2.0 Protocols\n\nThere are many more innovative protocols out there that are changing the way we think about decentralized finance, but to avoid writing an entire book's worth of material in a single post I will instead make the next post about these projects and provide an overview on which blockchain ecosystems besides Ethereum are worth investigating and maybe investing in.\n\nSee you next time!", "timestamp": 1635171430, "digest": "PZUSeyjIq8-Fow0sZas_KfinlGy4U_93nH6oKC8mWKg", "contributor": "0x940653d9C5076d2FDfd44F7BC8e66aeb5Fb598BE"}

1    前言\n\ndydx作为时下热门的衍生品交易平台，很多朋友在上面交易挖矿，但是我们刷多少手续费合适呢，本文将研究dydx奖励的数学模型试图找到最佳的手续费和持仓比例。\n\n## 2   dydx奖励的数学模型\n\n### 2.1 奖励公式\n\n从官方文档我们可知奖励公式为：\n\n![ydx交易挖矿奖励公式](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SUiHjTxQebModQbN_PKqc.png?height=227&width=524)\n\n其中：\n\n*traderScore*——交易分数\n\n*feesPaid*——交易所消耗手续费\n\n*openInterest*——平均未平仓合约持仓\n\n*reward*——奖励的dydx数量\n\n*totalTraderScores*——所有用户的交易分数\n\n### 2.2  收益公式\n\n从奖励公式中我们可以看出我们得到的奖励受我们交易的平均未平仓合约持仓和交易消耗的手续费影响，而我们的收益是奖励的dydx价值减去交易所消耗手续费:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HcGX2UBoMUrzR0ZqPrvg4.png?height=36&width=912)\n\n其中*price*为dydx兑美元价格/usd，因此：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b2jy1vA6yniFlWHnETvjr.png?height=67&width=929)\n\n从收益公式我们可以知道收益也受dydx价格影响，dydx价格太低的话我们反而会亏。\n\n### 2.3   收益分析\n\n从收益公式我们可以看出实际上手续费和平均未平仓合约持仓量的最佳比例是变动的，因为随着时间的推移，我们的平均未平仓合约持仓量占平台总持仓量是变化的，同时也受币价影响。\n\n假设交易挖矿最后几天时，dydx币价固定不动，我们的平均未平仓合约持仓量占平台总持仓量也变化不大了，这时这几个因素我们可以综合为一个常数*k*：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tVW23RgBk7gUUzGEBhBJh.png?height=132&width=927)\n\n令：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Hk4qqPiV5OxOl-n92youv.png?height=72&width=925)\n\n则：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wLexULgVpaD5JaN2KpRSN.png?height=35&width=909)\n\n由于最后几天的我们的平均未平仓合约持仓量占平台总持仓量也变化不大，唯一可能有比较大的变化是dydx的价格，其数学图像如下图所示。\n\n![图2-2 收益与常数k和消耗手续费函数图像](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jiOjFGrGYRQou4dObQs4r.png?height=490&width=900)\n\n不同的常数*K*最佳收益时的手续费是不一样的，例如当我们的平均未平仓合约持仓量占平台总持仓量过小或者dydx价格过低时导致常数*K*过小，此时只要有手续费就是亏的：\n\n![图 2‑3当K过小时收益曲线](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Uh-OcS8nwbRkhegFK6CQ8.png?height=402&width=757)\n\n当K适中时，从下图我们可以看出下图曲线最顶点就是最佳收益点，此时的消耗手续非与平均未平仓合约持仓量占比是最佳比例。\n\n![图2-4 当k适中时收益曲线](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IeRwZ-1Hj0B1cFfp8pHKn.png?height=421&width=759)\n\n当*K*过高时，例如dydx的价格太高，如下图所示，此时我们刷的手续费越多越好。\n\n![图 2‑5当K过大时收益曲线](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CvleugPan70z3qAkuqDXR.png?height=427&width=750)\n\n## 3      手续费该刷多少\n\n### 3.1   最佳收益计算\n\n今天是2021年10月25日，距离本次交易挖矿周期还剩一天多时间，我以我的账户进计算，dydx现价是18.2美金一个，我们分别算出假如dydx价格继续跌至15美金时和涨至21美金甚至是50美金时的最佳收益。以下先计算dydx价格为18.2时账户的最佳收益。\n\n**3.1.1 账户一**\n\n![图 3‑1

3.2   结论\n\n1、不管你的平均未平仓合约持仓量是多少、保证金多少，最佳收益时挖矿成本占比（挖矿成本/dydx价格）大致为70%；\n\n2、从上表可以看出，dydx价格极大的影响了我们刷手续费的策略，当dydx价格保持在18.2时，手续费与平均未平仓合约持仓量的比例大致为0.0287，dydx挖矿成本平均为12.75美金；\n\n3、上述所计算的4种dydx价格时的不同最佳手续费与平均未平仓合约持仓量的比例只是假设我们在获得dydx代币奖励时立即兑现收益的结果，如果你对dydx看好，想要长持dydx代币，那么可以刷更多的手续费，例如，假如我看好两个月后dydx能涨至50美金，那么我可以按照dydx币价50美金的策略去刷手续费。\n\n

We aim to be a first of its kind, cross-chain NFT project. Mosh aims to become a cross-chain symbol, bridging chains on different networks.\n\n## Story\n\nWe like the nouns, when we first saw it this summer - it was such an innovative project. However, the price is too high and rather exclusive for ordinary folks like us. Also, due to its nature, it is practically impossible for ordinary folks like us to participate in the governance… We thought we could do better!

Daily auctions -  Each day on all networks\n\nThis will be auctioned on the official [app.mosh.lol](https://app.mosh.lol/) website.  \n All proceeds go to the Mosh DAO treasury.  \n (Details to be announced soon…)\n\n### B. $MOSH Token Launch on Juicebox\n\nMoshDAO's governance token, $MOSH Token will be launched on [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money). $MOSH will be used to provide liquidity to the Mosh DAO, but also used as an overall to the Mosh ecosystem. (Proposal, Voting, Community-only meetups, etc.)\n\n### C. Mosh DAO governance\n\nMosh DAO consists of two forms of governance.\n\n1. Mosh Treasury DAO\n   Only the Mosh NFT holders have the rights to govern the treasury.\n2. Mosh Governance DAO  \n All $MOSH Token holders have a right to influence the direction for the project, including derivatives and other spinoffs.\n\n## **Main points**\n\n* The mosh artwork is not public domain, but spin-offs will be encouraged on the Mosh Governance DAO.\n* 1 mosh trustlessly auctioned every 24 hours forever, spanning 3 different networks.\n* 100% of mosh auction proceeds are trustlessly sent to Mosh DAO treasury.\n* Mosh treasury will be controlled by governance in the Mosh DAO.\n* Founder of MoshDAO, 'Moshers' receives rewards in the form of Mosh NFT. (14.28% of supply for the first 5 years)\n\n## **Daily Mosh Auctions**\n\nWe will generate one mosh, every day, forever on a multi-chain. All proceeds will directly go to the Mosh DAO Treasury. Every 7th Mosh will go directly to the \"Moshers\" founder's wallet. (for the first 5 years)\n\n## **Mosh DAO**\n\nMosh DAO will be governed on [gov.mosh.lol](https://gov.mosh.lol), through [snapshot.org](http://snapshot.org) protocol.\n\n## **Mosh Traits**\n\nYou can randomly see the generated mosh images on [art.mosh.lol](https://art.mosh.lol).\n\n## **Moshers Rewards**\n\n'Moshers' are the 3 founders that founded MoshDAO.

Here are a few—but certainly not all—reasons why we change our pfps.\n\n**To hide our irl identity for privacy**\n\nThe vast range of activities on the internet has expanded so much that we are living almost all of our lives online. Working, playing, socializing, and more are all experienced on the same screen. Having a separate identity between work and play can help compartmentalize each so that one doesn't blend into the other making navigating the internet just a bit more organized.\n\n**To divert attention onto another subject**\n\nOur profile pics can be changed to images of our or another's piece of work, art, or even a movement. This act can say we believe in the story of that image or the people behind it.\n\n**To express our personality**\n\nUltimately, whatever we change our pfp to is an expression of ourselves. Just in the same way we'd carefully select irl photos of ourselves to provide a tiny window into who we are, the same goes for any art, collectible, or image we choose as our pfp.\n\n**To feel a sense of belonging**\n\nWhat's different and maybe the most special aspect of collectible pfps is the community aspect. Belonging and connection are both essential human needs! Using a pfp from a 10k collection, for example, showcases an immediate shared experience of ownership of that NFT.\n\nOur identities are multilayered and complex because we're human beings with complex lives. The internet allows us to express our identity in whatever way we choose and there is freedom in that fluidity and flexibility.\n\n\n---\n\n*This micro-essay is #003 of ship30for30 challenge.*", "timestamp": 1635176655, "digest": "lQSY6r4HA0ViOUIA_is2O697jlgG_sPRuZzKZYJTujE", "contributor": "0x25E0FBc652CfC890d308961b7D34c08d109A491B"}

{"id": "XNe2G2HWCRx2SAKxDW_PKS-5Tl1cIL2CTrniomQi97E", "title": "Introducing Value Physics", "body": "Authors: BlockchainJames \\[James Waugh\\], nintynick \\[Nick Naraghi\\], Cryptnotiq \\[Ian\\], Metadreamer \\[Hammad Jutt\\], Puniaviison \\[Punia\\]\n\n# Why\n\nWe believe that the nexus of web3 technology, self-enlightenment, and environmental-economic conditions places humankind in the midst of a radical point in human evolution that can alter societies for millennia to come. \n\nOur mission is to build models which can aid individuals from any background, socioeconomic class, or location to help build a global collective consciousness that can never be brought down by any ‘corrupt’ centralized power. \n\nWe fundamentally believe that each one of us has a light within us. When that light is recognized and aligned with the world we are able to produce our life’s work, and humanity as a whole evolves.\n\nMaking that ascension into our higher selves is an internal journey that can be influenced by external conditions. Meeting a spiritual guide, finding people you love working with, or devoting yourself to cause you deeply believe in are all examples of things we’re able to achieve when we have that alignment.\n\nAchieving that for every human in the world is the end game for human coordination. \n\n# How\n\nThis is done by stacking humans that are on the same wavelength in specific environments that stimulate a collective consciousness.\n\nThe metaverse brings people together like never before and allows the free flow of information and thought; however, we believe that there is a major missing factor here which is the physical environment. Even if a group is on the same wavelength, in their remote discussions they have different external stimuli affecting them subliminally which prevents them from truly reaching a collective conscious.\n\nWe hypothesize that bringing a similar group to a specific geographic location for short periods of time enables them to reach a new level of groupthink which can have exponential returns compared to remote communication. These can be short-lived experiences of a few days at a time to reach this new state of mind, then the ideas can be implemented remotely in-home locations until the time arises where another group thinks the session is required to push forward. \n\nJust how like SF grew to be a collective of minds, capital, all stacked in one location to advance technology across the world like never before, we are envisioning creating a decentralized version of this for spreading web3 technology at an even faster rate, where we can stack the required humans in locations (even if only temporarily) to create the same effect but on a highly global and integrated level where there are very low barriers to entry and anyone can participate.  \n\n# What\n\nValue physics is a weird phrase, what does it mean?\n\nValue physics seeks to define the relationship between people and how they coordinate - with “value” being the elementary particle by which this coordination happens. Drawing parallels with physics - similar to how the photon is the elementary particle that carries the electromagnetic force.\n\nOutside of making us seem way smarter than we actually are, we find that the analogy with physics is useful in helping us create a mental model for how value works and how to explore it.\n\nSomething we have to work on to create a common understanding of is what we mean when we talk about “value”. A provisional definition we are playing with is: Value is the emergent benefit that emerges out of action.\n\nAn example being: a woodcutter chopping down a tree to create wood. Extra value is created by the action that is greater than the tree or the person by itself.\n\nAs societies and economies emerge and grow more complex, we find the locus of value not being in the direct interaction between a person and a resource, but rather in the interaction between people.** \n **\n\nWe think about coordination as the set of underlying values, stories, principles, and institutions that support our ability to work together. All of which create our equivalent to the laws of physics that govern the material world.\n\n# Coordination\n\nCoordination between people to accomplish shared goals is the largest creator and driver of value that we have today. As such, improvements in coordination are incredibly high leverage and massively important as they ripple to every corner of the modern economy.\n\nIn the economic sense, the idea of value is mostly abstracted by “the market” and exists as much more of a theoretical concept to most people. As economies grow more complex and global, this effect will only continue.\n\nThe market is a beautiful thing. Though flawed, through a mostly decentralized structure, it is able to aggregate the opinions, preferences, and beliefs of a wide swath of economic participants into a unit of account that is able to be relationally compared to other prices to understand relative value. Super dope!\n\nCurrently, most of the market is represented by stocks \\[and their associated derivatives\\] that embody the corporation. While those that trade and invest in stocks are ngmi, they represented a huge step function improvement with how we coordinated together. They enabled enterprising individuals to explore \\[and \\*cough\\* colonize \\*cough\\*\\] and map the world to eventually usher in an era of unprecedented globalization.\n\nThe issue with stocks though is that they are rigid. They exist as paper certificates that are digitally represented in silos within comatose and obscure institutions that literally no one has ever heard of \\[[DTCC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dtcc.asp)\\]. As such, they can’t really interact with the rest of society. \n\nThere's no way for Communities/Humans to truly get behind these projects more than simply buying x amount of stock. As an example, it is impossible for Coca-Cola to give a fractionalized share of their company back to a customer when they buy a drink. The cultural gap is also a large chasm to cross - AirBnB proposed giving shares to super hosts, but the proposal was [shot down](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/airbnb-wants-to-give-shares-in-its-business-to-hosts/).\n\n# Ethereum, ERC20 Tokens, and the Internet of Value\n\nWith ERC20 tokens, we see the coordination mechanisms of the joint-stock, open market era becoming digital. This means these mechanisms become orders of magnitude more fluid, flexible, and impactful. Another step-function improvement in coordination.\n\nUnderstanding this as simply something that takes a physical representation and turns it digital is accurate, but understated. When information became digital with the internet, we rapidly moved from newspapers to social networks within 10 years. Such is the profound level of change we can expect to come to coordinating value with the wider adoption of tokens.\n\nIn studying Value Physics, within the new paradigm of the ERC20 token, we want to describe the underpinnings of token economies and what they are capable of doing. One way we approach describing this theoretical framework is by doing value experiments. In a similar vein to how aspects of physics are understood and described. \n\n# Value Experiments\n\nWe aren’t really the first ones to propose the idea of doing value experiments. Though, it may never have previously been described as such.\n\nThere is a long legacy of experiments we can look at in the crypto space:\n\n1. Tokens as a fundraising mechanism.\n   1. Pioneered through the ICO in the 2017-ish era.\n2. Token games leveraging human psychology to produce emergent effects.\n   1. Pioneered by Team JUST most famously through[ FOMO 3D](https://news.bitcoin.com/fomo3d-team-launch-new-dapp-thats-not-just-a-game/).\n      1. Attempting to define an AI that builds itself by coordinating the people creating the game. Some trippy shit!.\n3. Liquidity mining.\n   1. Pioneered by Synthetix and [Compound](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/06/25/liquidity-mining-with-compound-finance-just-a-fad-or-the-latest-toolbox-after-ieo-icos/).\n      1. Kicking of DeFi summer!\n4. Targeted Airdrops.\n   1. Unclear who really pioneered it, but [Handshake](https://medium.com/coinmonks/understanding-the-handshake-airdrop-and-reserved-names-428d9e90b560) and Uniswap were the early, prominent examples.\n5. DAO coordination.\n   1. What was first described by ‘The DAO’ coordinating as a community means social capital & financial capital can be combined to create exponential organizations.\n   2. Tangible examples of this are MetaCartel, MetaCartel Ventures, etc.\n6. Web3 development.\n   1. Value incentives for more meta coordination. Pioneered by[ MetaFactory](https://www.metafactory.ai/).\n      1. Giving back tokens to those that buy their products, to contractors that they work with, etc.\n      2. DamagedGoods’/MF idea of giving tokens to those that RETURN damaged, stained, no longer fitting MetaFactory clothes.\n\nThe scale of experimentation we are able to conduct on the idea of value through tokens and related pieces of blockchain infrastructure vastly exceeds anything we were able to do in the past. For that reason alone we can’t help but feel incredibly bullish on our collective future here.\n\nThere is so much to be learned by experimenting and understanding the experiments that came before us!\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe seek to understand Value Physics so that we may improve the way by which we coordinate. We do this so that builders may use this information to coordinate to solve all of our current most pressing issues. Coordinating humans and ideas is the single most important way to drive forward a brighter future - now we have digital value to do this.\n\nThings like:\n\n1. Global Warming\n2. Natural Resource Depletion\n3. Degradation of Institutions\n4. Monopolization of Power\n\nFor that, we are excited!\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1635177113, "digest": "mfQHjcr1Ealb4CGQCOQe5hIMZWzoj5v5suIagYTWaT0", "contributor": "0x421f223e19877D9765Ecd6e8EC4812457229B36A"}

Forefront’s Season One was no exception.\n\nThroughout the season, our community was in the weeds of dozens of projects, initiatives, and discoveries. Every day there were new people to meet, new challenges to overcome, and new boundaries to push forward.\n\nIn order to keep progressing efficiently towards our mission of becoming the **“Port of Entry to Web3”**, we need to reflect, recover, and recalibrate.\n\nAs Season One comes to a close, we’re calling on our community to take some time to explore what made their Forefront experience great, provide insight about where we can improve, and shape where we go from here.\n\nFirst, let’s take some time to celebrate what we’ve accomplished.\n\n## Season One Highlights\n\n![Season One — Highlights](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vjsfewomFqroPlrJTi3cb.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\n[Forefront Season One](https://ff.mirror.xyz/Fj6LKnH1FSwz5eFaHBNuvChhn1Z_nA82w7FthkOV8Hg) was titled Enter the Forge. Our goal was to begin to build the teams and structures necessary to grow Forefront into a DAO powerhouse. It is unbelievable to think about all we’ve achieved in the last three months.\n\n### DAO Contributors\n\nThe Forefront DAO grew from just 5 core contributors in the Pre-Season to now 29 contributors spread across three Guilds. Our Culture Guild took the lead on building out a formal onboarding process, helping new members gain context, meet other contributors, and complete bounties as a pathway to becoming a contributor. In parallel, we build out a contributor rewards structure with base allocations, project rewards, and an end-of-season Coordinape pool.\n\nIn part thanks to the treasury diversification round, Forefront was also able to [onboard](https://snapshot.org/#/ffdao.eth/proposal/QmejUFkTFzhWS3McVpYbfX3C4u1cBLSFqqfqysvXe3rrL5) its first official Full- and Part-Time Core Contributors to the DAO who can be paid (partially) in USDC. These Contributors have each made long-term commitments to pushing forward high-level DAO initiatives and helping coordinate Guild activities.\n\nThe strides we’ve taken to empower and retain talent to put Forefront in an exciting position moving forward. While there is plenty to improve, we are extremely optimistic for what is to come.\n\n### Projects & Initiatives\n\nWhile the newsletter was one of Forefront’s core “products” heading into Season One, the team managed to ship at an insane rate throughout the last three months, dramatically expanding our reach and workload.\n\nFirst, Forefront pushed the boundaries of DAO culture with our FF Birthday Celebration. This was a multi-day digital event with games, competitions, DJ sets, and so much more. Be on the lookout for [Forefront DAOlloween](https://metaverse.forefront.club/) coming this month.\n\nFrom a content perspective, Season One saw the launch of some major new media pillars:\n\n* [Forefront Learn,](https://forefront.market/learn) a comprehensive resource to go from zero to DAO contributor by learning about social tokens, DAOs, and more.\n* [Forefront Podcast](https://forefront.market/newsletter), which includes high-quality recordings of our weekly FF Hangouts + weekly news wrap-ups of the crypto space at large.\n* [Forefront Wrapped](https://forum.forefront.news/d/43-forefront-wrapped-5), our weekly DAO summary for contributors and lurkers alike to be able to stay up-to-date on all things happening in the Forefront DAO.\n\nThere are plenty more projects in the works, all with the mission of making Forefront the port of entry for web3.\n\nFinally, Forefront had some in-person fun this Season as well! FF Contributors attended and [spoke at MCON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=797dfjgF1wg), and we’ll be making some moves at LisCon as well.\n\n### Treasury Diversification\n\nThe beginning of Season One kicked off Forefront’s [treasury diversification](https://ff.mirror.xyz/Yqo1j1RlCowOCRBnxupprIZ8w4RLRxit67x6pIK1hrA) round. A lot went into this process, including answering questions like who should we include in the round, how much should we raise, what should the terms be, and many more.\n\nEventually, with tons of community support, we landed on a $2.1M raise from dozens of strategic investors, angels, and community contributors. This addition to Forefront’s treasury will help us scale our effort, onboard full-time contributors, and continue to build at the cutting edge of DAOs.\n\nThe initial proposal was hosted on our Forum for community feedback. We then hosted 3 separate Hangouts in our Discord with many of the investors leading the round where community members could ask questions and submit ideas. Many changes were suggested, which we incorporated into the proposal. That final proposal was then voted on Snapshot before the process was kicked off. We’re proud to be able to involve so many community members in the process and in the round itself.\n\n### Growth\n\n![Season One — Snapshot](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WbWGOuDJXwrOJ5IcEKJE7.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nAs our output has increased, so has our impact. During season one our core contributors grew from 5 to 29 people (a 480% increase), who collectively earned 68,971 $FF in return for their efforts.\n\nAcross the 13 events and hangouts we ran in Season One we saw thousands of attendees and a truly insane roster of featured guests including Kei Kreutler, Toby Shorin, Ameer “Sirsu”, Patrick Rivera, John Palmer and Jarrod Dicker.\n\nBigger and bigger ships are bringing people to the shores of web3 and to new projects within it, and we’re thrilled that the leaders who are truly pioneering the space are coming to Forefront’s port to help guide them forward.\n\n## Introduction Off-Season\n\n![Off-Season Goals](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8wFm1pIBwf-hYsZ8A8KbJ.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\n### Off-Season Goals\n\nWhile we’re more excited than ever about the future of Forefront, we can’t move forward blindly. Planning for Season Two and beyond must be an intentional, community-driven effort. As such, we’re kicking off an “Off-Season” period featuring community feedback opportunities, North Star sessions, Values Design, and much more. The goal is to ensure that everyone’s voice is heard in imagining the future of Forefront. Be on the lookout in the Discord, newsletter, and forum for meeting dates!\n\nWe’ve been running full speed ahead for the last 3 months – this next period is a time to slow down, reflect, and reimagine. We’ll still be working hard to produce and ship as a DAO, but with a renewed focus on the future.\n\nWe are gently building each other up by strengthening our bonds through trust and vulnerability. It is imperative for longevity and community health that we build these Off-Season periods into the fabric of Forefront.\n\n### Off-Season Program:\n\n1. Reflection gatherings on Community Feedback\n2. North Star workshop\n3. Governance workshop\n4. Season & Product roadmap workshop\n5. Team Building & Health sessions\n6. Party like it’s 1999\n7. More TBD via community Vibez\n\nOff-Season will officially starts October 28th and run for a period of 5 weeks.\n\n## Season Two - Looking Ahead\n\nWhile there’s plenty to think through during the Off-Season, the Forefront community has already been thinking hard about what the future might look like.\n\n![Season Two — What's Next ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hIH7cQiezzoTsLfIn_ggJ.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nSome projects are already in the works across various Guilds. For example, we’re completely reimagining what Forefront’s DAO2DAO strategy looks like and how we can promote ecosystem-wide positive-sum games. We’re also working on product development (infrastructure for social token communities), public goods funding, new media experiments, and so much more.\n\n## Forefront Foundations\n\nForefront has come a long way, and we’re extremely excited for the future as we continue to grow and evolve, together.\n\nNow, more than ever, we’re calling on the larger web3 community to come join us in building a vibrant, positive, creative community. We are actively building the port of entry to web3, and we need everyone to do their part in achieving this goal.\n\nIf you’re interested in joining Season 2 reflection and planning sessions, have a project you’d like to work on with Forefront, or just want to join for the vibes, definitely stop by [our Discord](https://forefront.community)!\n\nForefront is shipping – we hope you’ll join us :)\n\n*Thank you to our evolving community and to all active contributors who made Season One possible: Caroline Nguyen, Jihad Esmail, Joey DeBruin, CPTN Skeletor, Grendel, Makoto Inoue, David Tomu, Rafael, Chase Chapman, Gian Ferrer, Mel Shields, Austin Robey, Marvin Lin, Sat Panesar, Eliot, Richard Patey, Rafathebuilder, Bee Bradley, Alex (Aureus), Snorky, Jacob, Meral, Tolu, Vooka, Milan, Isiah, Qhawe, Natalie, Carlos Gomes, Andy Tom, Jenil Thakker, and Nir Kabessa.*", "timestamp": 1635136358, "digest": "AVKMQHAdcSiyKwCBgV0dqsWckalKC9dPzIJLUNg_A9M", "contributor": "0xF0CAd7C8b383f79A879eB6Df644e336234EBDac8"}

Every day there were new people to meet, new challenges to overcome, and new boundaries to push forward.\n\nIn order to keep progressing efficiently towards our mission of becoming the **“Port of Entry to Web3”**, we need to reflect, recover, and recalibrate.\n\nAs Season One comes to a close, we’re calling on our community to take some time to explore what made their Forefront experience great, provide insight about where we can improve, and shape where we go from here.\n\nFirst, let’s take some time to celebrate what we’ve accomplished.\n\n## Season One Highlights\n\n![Season One — Highlights](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vjsfewomFqroPlrJTi3cb.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\n[Forefront Season One](https://ff.mirror.xyz/Fj6LKnH1FSwz5eFaHBNuvChhn1Z_nA82w7FthkOV8Hg) was titled Enter the Forge. Our goal was to begin to build the teams and structures necessary to grow Forefront into a DAO powerhouse. It is unbelievable to think about all we’ve achieved in the last three months.\n\n### DAO Contributors\n\nThe Forefront DAO grew from just 5 core contributors in the Pre-Season to now 29 contributors spread across three Guilds. Our Culture Guild took the lead on building out a formal onboarding process, helping new members gain context, meet other contributors, and complete bounties as a pathway to becoming a contributor. In parallel, we build out a contributor rewards structure with base allocations, project rewards, and an end-of-season Coordinape pool.\n\nIn part thanks to the treasury diversification round, Forefront was also able to [onboard](https://snapshot.org/#/ffdao.eth/proposal/QmejUFkTFzhWS3McVpYbfX3C4u1cBLSFqqfqysvXe3rrL5) its first official Full- and Part-Time Core Contributors to the DAO who can be paid (partially) in USDC. These Contributors have each made long-term commitments to pushing forward high-level DAO initiatives and helping coordinate Guild activities.\n\nThe strides we’ve taken to empower and retain talent to put Forefront in an exciting position moving forward. While there is plenty to improve, we are extremely optimistic for what is to come.\n\n### Projects & Initiatives\n\nWhile the newsletter was one of Forefront’s core “products” heading into Season One, the team managed to ship at an insane rate throughout the last three months, dramatically expanding our reach and workload.\n\nFirst, Forefront pushed the boundaries of DAO culture with our FF Birthday Celebration. This was a multi-day digital event with games, competitions, DJ sets, and so much more. Be on the lookout for [Forefront DAOlloween](https://metaverse.forefront.club/) coming this month.\n\nFrom a content perspective, Season One saw the launch of some major new media pillars:\n\n* [Forefront Learn,](https://forefront.market/learn) a comprehensive resource to go from zero to DAO contributor by learning about social tokens, DAOs, and more.\n* [Forefront Podcast](https://forefront.market/newsletter), which includes high-quality recordings of our weekly FF Hangouts + weekly news wrap-ups of the crypto space at large.\n* [Forefront Wrapped](https://forum.forefront.news/d/43-forefront-wrapped-5), our weekly DAO summary for contributors and lurkers alike to be able to stay up-to-date on all things happening in the Forefront DAO.\n\nThere are plenty more projects in the works, all with the mission of making Forefront the port of entry for web3.\n\nFinally, Forefront had some in-person fun this Season as well! FF Contributors attended and [spoke at MCON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=797dfjgF1wg), and we’ll be making some moves at LisCon as well.\n\n### Treasury Diversification\n\nThe beginning of Season One kicked off Forefront’s [treasury diversification](https://ff.mirror.xyz/Yqo1j1RlCowOCRBnxupprIZ8w4RLRxit67x6pIK1hrA) round. A lot went into this process, including answering questions like who should we include in the round, how much should we raise, what should the terms be, and many more.\n\nEventually, with tons of community support, we landed on a $2.1M raise from dozens of strategic investors, angels, and community contributors. This addition to Forefront’s treasury will help us scale our effort, onboard full-time contributors, and continue to build at the cutting edge of DAOs.\n\nThe initial proposal was hosted on our Forum for community feedback. We then hosted 3 separate Hangouts in our Discord with many of the investors leading the round where community members could ask questions and submit ideas. Many changes were suggested, which we incorporated into the proposal. That final proposal was then voted on Snapshot before the process was kicked off. We’re proud to be able to involve so many community members in the process and in the round itself.\n\n### Growth\n\n![Season One — Snapshot](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WbWGOuDJXwrOJ5IcEKJE7.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nAs our output has increased, so has our impact. During season one our core contributors grew from 5 to 29 people (a 480% increase), who collectively earned 68,971 $FF in return for their efforts.\n\nAcross the 13 events and hangouts we ran in Season One we saw thousands of attendees and a truly insane roster of featured guests including Kei Kreutler, Toby Shorin, Ameer “Sirsu”, Patrick Rivera, John Palmer and Jarrod Dicker.\n\nBigger and bigger ships are bringing people to the shores of web3 and to new projects within it, and we’re thrilled that the leaders who are truly pioneering the space are coming to Forefront’s port to help guide them forward.\n\n## Introduction Off-Season\n\n![Off-Season Goals](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8wFm1pIBwf-hYsZ8A8KbJ.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\n### Off-Season Goals\n\nWhile we’re more excited than ever about the future of Forefront, we can’t move forward blindly. Planning for Season Two and beyond must be an intentional, community-driven effort. As such, we’re kicking off an “Off-Season” period featuring community feedback opportunities, North Star sessions, Values Design, and much more. The goal is to ensure that everyone’s voice is heard in imagining the future of Forefront. Be on the lookout in the Discord, newsletter, and forum for meeting dates!\n\nWe’ve been running full speed ahead for the last 3 months – this next period is a time to slow down, reflect, and reimagine. We’ll still be working hard to produce and ship as a DAO, but with a renewed focus on the future.\n\nWe are gently building each other up by strengthening our bonds through trust and vulnerability. It is imperative for longevity and community health that we build these Off-Season periods into the fabric of Forefront.\n\n### Off-Season Program:\n\n1. Reflection gatherings on Community Feedback\n2. North Star workshop\n3. Governance workshop\n4. Season & Product roadmap workshop\n5. Team Building & Health sessions\n6. Party like it’s 1999\n7. More TBD via community Vibez\n\nOff-Season will officially starts October 28th and run for a period of 5 weeks.\n\n## Season Two - Looking Ahead\n\nWhile there’s plenty to think through during the Off-Season, the Forefront community has already been thinking hard about what the future might look like.\n\n![Season Two — What's Next ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hIH7cQiezzoTsLfIn_ggJ.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nSome projects are already in the works across various Guilds. For example, we’re completely reimagining what Forefront’s DAO2DAO strategy looks like and how we can promote ecosystem-wide positive-sum games. We’re also working on product development (infrastructure for social token communities), public goods funding, new media experiments, and so much more.\n\n## Forefront Foundations\n\nForefront has come a long way, and we’re extremely excited for the future as we continue to grow and evolve, together.\n\nNow, more than ever, we’re calling on the larger web3 community to come join us in building a vibrant, positive, creative community. We are actively building the port of entry to web3, and we need everyone to do their part in achieving this goal.\n\nIf you’re interested in joining Season 2 reflection and planning sessions, have a project you’d like to work on with Forefront, or just want to join for the vibes, definitely stop by [our Discord](https://forefront.community)!\n\nForefront is shipping – we hope you’ll join us :)\n\n*Thank you to our evolving community and to all active contributors who made Season One possible: Caroline Nguyen, Jihad Esmail, Joey DeBruin, CPTN Skeletor, Grendel, Makoto Inoue, David Tomu, Rafael, Chase Chapman, Gian Ferrer, Mel Shields, Austin Robey, Marvin Lin, Sat Panesar, Eliot, Richard Patey, Rafathebuilder, Bee Bradley, Alex (Aureus), Snorky, Jacob, Meral, Tolu, Vooka, Milan, Isiah, Qhawe, Natalie, Carlos Gomes, Andy Tom, Jenil Thakker, and Nir Kabessa.*", "timestamp": 1635136358, "digest": "AVKMQHAdcSiyKwCBgV0dqsWckalKC9dPzIJLUNg_A9M", "contributor": "0xF0CAd7C8b383f79A879eB6Df644e336234EBDac8"}

摘要\n\n本文主要研究了加密货币领域去中心化衍生品交易平台dydx的数学模型，试图找到最佳的手续费消耗策略，通过对4种dydx价格时三个账户的最佳收益的计算分析发现，当单个dydx代币挖矿成本与dydx价格的比例等于70%时，挖矿收益最高。\n\n**关键词**：dydx  DeFi  衍生品   交易挖矿  最佳手续费比例\n\n## 1    前言\n\ndydx作为时下热门的衍生品交易平台，很多朋友在上面交易挖矿，但是我们刷多少手续费合适呢，本文将研究dydx奖励的数学模型试图找到最佳的手续费和持仓比例。\n\n## 2   dydx奖励的数学模型\n\n### 2.1 奖励公式\n\n从官方文档我们可知奖励公式为：\n\n![dydx交易挖矿奖励公式](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SUiHjTxQebModQbN_PKqc.png?height=227&width=524)\n\n其中：\n\n*traderScore*——交易分数\n\n*feesPaid*——交易所消耗手续费\n\n*openInterest*——平均未平仓合约持仓\n\n*reward*——奖励的dydx数量\n\n*totalTraderScores*——所有用户的交易分数\n\n### 2.2  收益公式\n\n从奖励公式中我们可以看出我们得到的奖励受我们交易的平均未平仓合约持仓和交易消耗的手续费影响，而我们的收益是奖励的dydx价值减去交易所消耗手续费:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HcGX2UBoMUrzR0ZqPrvg4.png?height=36&width=912)\n\n其中*price*为dydx兑美元价格/usd，因此：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b2jy1vA6yniFlWHnETvjr.png?height=67&width=929)\n\n从收益公式我们可以知道收益也受dydx价格影响，dydx价格太低的话我们反而会亏。\n\n### 2.3   收益分析\n\n从收益公式我们可以看出实际上手续费和平均未平仓合约持仓量的最佳比例是变动的，因为随着时间的推移，我们的平均未平仓合约持仓量占平台总持仓量是变化的，同时也受币价影响。\n\n假设交易挖矿最后几天时，dydx币价固定不动，我们的平均未平仓合约持仓量占平台总持仓量也变化不大了，这时这几个因素我们可以综合为一个常数*k*：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tVW23RgBk7gUUzGEBhBJh.png?height=132&width=927)\n\n令：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Hk4qqPiV5OxOl-n92youv.png?height=72&width=925)\n\n则：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wLexULgVpaD5JaN2KpRSN.png?height=35&width=909)\n\n由于最后几天的我们的平均未平仓合约持仓量占平台总持仓量也变化不大，唯一可能有比较大的变化是dydx的价格，其数学图像如下图所示。\n\n![图2-2 收益与常数k和消耗手续费函数图像](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jiOjFGrGYRQou4dObQs4r.png?height=490&width=900)\n\n不同的常数*K*最佳收益时的手续费是不一样的，例如当我们的平均未平仓合约持仓量占平台总持仓量过小或者dydx价格过低时导致常数*K*过小，此时只要有手续费就是亏的：\n\n![图 2‑3当K过小时收益曲线](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Uh-OcS8nwbRkhegFK6CQ8.png?height=402&width=757)\n\n当K适中时，从下图我们可以看出下图曲线最顶点就是最佳收益点，此时的消耗手续非与平均未平仓合约持仓量占比是最佳比例。\n\n![图2-4 当k适中时收益曲线](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IeRwZ-1Hj0B1cFfp8pHKn.png?height=421&width=759)\n\n当*K*过高时，例如dydx的价格太高，如下图所示，此时我们刷的手续费越多越好。\n\n![图 2‑5当K过大时收益曲线](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CvleugPan70z3qAkuqDXR.png?height=427&width=750)\n\n## 3      手续费该刷多少\n\n### 3.1   最佳收益计算\n\n今天是2021年10月25日，距离本次交易挖矿周期还剩一天多时间，我以我的账户进计算，dydx现价是18.2美金一个，我们分别算出假如dydx价格继续跌至15美金时和涨至21美金甚至是50美金时的最佳收益。以下先计算dydx价格为18.2时账户的最佳收益。\n\n**3.1.1 账户一**\n\n![图 3‑1 账户一2021年10月25日账户一交易数据](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uplhRzobhP4wtKt1LNHiC.jpg?height=244&width=1089)\n\n上图是我的第一个账户交易数据，根据数据可以算出常数*k*。\n\n因为：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kt536INwb6rn2QLbZrC-1.png?height=57&width=752)\n\n所以可以算出此时*totalTraderScores* ≈ 141662183.31\n\n又因为：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZPWIwc0JAxj29YvoxpDxo.png?height=65&width=754)\n\n所以当dydx价格为18.2时，*k*=19.788\n\n此时收益为：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c6wyg6DHw458fMbDysHb2.png?height=45&width=753)\n\n收益曲线为：\n\n![图

常数为19.788时的收益与手续费曲线](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f82jguXVKpfwKZneK-msC.png?height=488&width=750)\n\n收益最大时的手续费*feePaidmax*=6353美金，手续费和平均未平仓合约持仓量比例*proportion*为：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4bdlmED6Hx5_j-jKs31pP.png?height=58&width=752)\n\n此时单个dydx的挖矿成本*cost*为：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TY4kb0d0TsMykad20cld2.png?height=71&width=752)\n\n**3.1.2 账户二**\n\n我的第二个账户的交易数据为：\n\n*feePaid*=1050.83，*openInterest*=117019，*reword*=116.6811\n\n计算下来*totalTraderScores*=142031360，*K*=16.293\n\n![图 3‑3常数k为16.293时的收益和手续费曲线](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/00aPh5L1qEPusFVzz0rU_.png?height=487&width=753)\n\n收益最大时的手续费*feePaidmax*=

账户三**\n\n我的第三个账户的交易数据为：\n\n*feePaid*=2.39，*openInterest*=405.99，*reword*=0.3015\n\n计算下来*totalTraderScores*=141899523，*K*=2.9818\n\n![图 3‑4常数k为2.2918时的收益和手续费曲线](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/X116-U9JIG29ecNsiF9Z9.png?height=499&width=751)\n\n收益最大时的手续费*feePaidmax*= 11.6美金，手续费和平均未平仓合约持仓量比例*proportion*为：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ugoo9W5HWBn67CZ8Hc0tm.png?height=65&width=757)\n\n此时的dydx成本*cost*为：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nBmBsgDpzeJhLiop3WSK0.png?height=85&width=770)\n\n综上所述，三个账户数据对比如下：\n\n![表 3‑1三个账户数据对比](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E-h1NtivypsJzhYAcKJ_K.png?height=632&width=1062)\n\n### 3.2   结论\n\n1、不管你的平均未平仓合约持仓量是多少、保证金多少，最佳收益时挖矿成本占比（挖矿成本/dydx价格）大致为70%；\n\n2、从上表可以看出，dydx价格极大的影响了我们刷手续费的策略，当dydx价格保持在18.2时，手续费与平均未平仓合约持仓量的比例大致为0.0287，dydx挖矿成本平均为12.75美金；\n\n3、上述所计算的4种dydx价格时的不同最佳手续费与平均未平仓合约持仓量的比例只是假设我们在获得dydx代币奖励时立即兑现收益的结果，如果你对dydx看好，想要长持dydx代币，那么可以刷更多的手续费，例如，假如我看好两个月后dydx能涨至50美金，那么我可以按照dydx币价50美金的策略去刷手续费。",

It’s a place where like-minded individuals can come together, pool resources, talent, and relationships to build a sustainable community where token holders can participate in the DAO’s cultural and financial growth.\n\nLearn more about DAOs [here](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw).\n\n## Who are we?\n\nWe’re a team of music lovers with a lifelong passion for unearthing the world’s best new talent.\n\nSince 2007, we’ve been finding, sharing, and working alongside many of music’s best new artists, whether it be through our record label (Dreams Never Die), our curation platform ([Before The Data](https://beforethedata.mirror.xyz/-_F5qE3jGx5rdFN4bsv4Gsm_qQu1j3SvCcxpaFyIjiM), FKA Hillydilly), or other outlets.\n\nWe earned our reputation in the industry by discovering and helping break some enormously influential artists ([Billie Eilish](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/11/magazine/billie-eilish-profile.html), [LANY](https://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2016/03/27/new-noise-lany/), Lorde, Two Feet, Yellow Days, Kygo, Chelsea Cutler, Tom Misch, [healy](https://www.memphisflyer.com/listen-up-ethan-healy-on-returning-to-his-memphis-roots-new-single-and-video-released-july-23rd), [joan](https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/interviews/joan-on-the-rise), VÉRTIÉ + many more). Despite our successes, we learned that pure music discovery wasn’t sustainable; in the process, though, we had unintentionally put ourselves in the perfect position to form a record label.\n\nIn our first two years, Dreams Never Die has signed over 23 new acts, and through our daily practice of sifting through hundreds of songs in every corner of the web, we intend to continue finding and developing the world’s best new talent.\n\nYou can read more about the label [here](https://mirror.xyz/dreamsneverdie.eth/E4tDOA4XgiCcq6R5PcQc7VV3jHFJAsbNDCVp7HJRgXY).\n\n## What are we building?\n\nSince its inception, Dreams Never Die’s mission has been to position artists for success by providing resources and guidance in the very early stages, while concurrently amassing a diverse catalog of forward-thinking songs from potential stars.\n\nNow, DAOs are expanding our scope.\n\nWe intend for Dreams Never Die to become an incubator for brand-new artists and aspiring music business talent alike, built around an incentivized and aligned community that participates in discovering, developing, distributing, and promoting the roster.\n\nSimilarly to the existing label, the music will be the backbone of the DAO.\n\n## Why are we building it?\n\nThe music industry’s current, data-driven structure makes it incredibly difficult for even the very best new artists to get heard and begin making money, especially without signing an often-exploitative deal with a big company. Not only are great new artists suffering from the current paradigm, but many passionate, talented minds wanting to work on the industry side are finding it equally difficult, especially without compromising their passion for great music itself.\n\nWeb3 presents new opportunities and solutions to these problems.\n\nWe want the Dreams Never Die Records DAO to form the building blocks of a Web3 community that can become sustainable around artist discovery, early-stage development, and making sure the best music gets heard.\n\nWe envision many of the world’s best new artists and aspiring music professionals aligning to explore new routes toward sustainability; we hope the DAO allows people who are great at what they do to make a living doing what they love.\n\n## Team:\n\n### Chad Hillard (Project Co-lead)\n\n* Founded Dreams Never Die Records, Before The Data, and Hillydilly.\n* 14+ years of additional industry experience as manager, A&R, promoter, and label owner.\n\n### Cole Ryan (Project Co-lead)\n\n* VP of A&R, Creative Director at Dreams Never Die Records.\n* Co-Founder, Editor, Creative Director at Before The Data (former Senior Writer at Hillydilly).\n* Artist Manager, DJ, Graphic Designer.\n\n### Ben Frigeri (Project Co-lead)\n\n* Senior Writer and Curator at Before The Data.\n* A&R, Manager.\n* Macro music trend analyst.\n\n### Cooper Turley (advisor)\n\nA leader and innovator in the web3, DeFI, and DAO landscape, [Cooper](https://alias.co/coopahtroopa/) is one of the most well-respected minds in the space.

It’s a place where like-minded individuals can come together, pool resources, talent, and relationships to build a sustainable community where token holders can participate in the DAO’s cultural and financial growth.\n\nLearn more about DAOs [here](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw).\n\n## Who are we?\n\nWe’re a team of music lovers with a lifelong passion for unearthing the world’s best new talent.\n\nSince 2007, we’ve been finding, sharing, and working alongside many of music’s best new artists, whether it be through our record label (Dreams Never Die), our curation platform ([Before The Data](https://beforethedata.mirror.xyz/-_F5qE3jGx5rdFN4bsv4Gsm_qQu1j3SvCcxpaFyIjiM), FKA Hillydilly), or other outlets.\n\nWe earned our reputation in the industry by discovering and helping break some enormously influential artists ([Billie Eilish](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/11/magazine/billie-eilish-profile.html), [LANY](https://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2016/03/27/new-noise-lany/), Lorde, Two Feet, Yellow Days, Kygo, Chelsea Cutler, Tom Misch, [healy](https://www.memphisflyer.com/listen-up-ethan-healy-on-returning-to-his-memphis-roots-new-single-and-video-released-july-23rd), [joan](https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/interviews/joan-on-the-rise), VÉRTIÉ + many more). Despite our successes, we learned that pure music discovery wasn’t sustainable; in the process, though, we had unintentionally put ourselves in the perfect position to form a record label.\n\nIn our first two years, Dreams Never Die has signed over 23 new acts, and through our daily practice of sifting through hundreds of songs in every corner of the web, we intend to continue finding and developing the world’s best new talent.\n\nYou can read more about the label [here](https://mirror.xyz/dreamsneverdie.eth/E4tDOA4XgiCcq6R5PcQc7VV3jHFJAsbNDCVp7HJRgXY).\n\n## What are we building?\n\nSince its inception, Dreams Never Die’s mission has been to position artists for success by providing resources and guidance in the very early stages, while concurrently amassing a diverse catalog of forward-thinking songs from potential stars.\n\nNow, DAOs are expanding our scope.\n\nWe intend for Dreams Never Die to become an incubator for brand-new artists and aspiring music business talent alike, built around an incentivized and aligned community that participates in discovering, developing, distributing, and promoting the roster.\n\nSimilarly to the existing label, the music will be the backbone of the DAO.\n\n## Why are we building it?\n\nThe music industry’s current, data-driven structure makes it incredibly difficult for even the very best new artists to get heard and begin making money, especially without signing an often-exploitative deal with a big company. Not only are great new artists suffering from the current paradigm, but many passionate, talented minds wanting to work on the industry side are finding it equally difficult, especially without compromising their passion for great music itself.\n\nWeb3 presents new opportunities and solutions to these problems.\n\nWe want the Dreams Never Die Records DAO to form the building blocks of a Web3 community that can become sustainable around artist discovery, early-stage development, and making sure the best music gets heard.\n\nWe envision many of the world’s best new artists and aspiring music professionals aligning to explore new routes toward sustainability; we hope the DAO allows people who are great at what they do to make a living doing what they love.\n\n## Team:\n\n### Chad Hillard (Project Co-lead)\n\n* Founded Dreams Never Die Records, Before The Data, and Hillydilly.\n* 14+ years of additional industry experience as manager, A&R, promoter, and label owner.\n\n### Cole Ryan (Project Co-lead)\n\n* VP of A&R, Creative Director at Dreams Never Die Records.\n* Co-Founder, Editor, Creative Director at Before The Data (former Senior Writer at Hillydilly).\n* Artist Manager, DJ, Graphic Designer.\n\n### Ben Frigeri (Project Co-lead)\n\n* Senior Writer and Curator at Before The Data.\n* A&R, Manager.\n* Macro music trend analyst.\n\n### Cooper Turley (advisor)\n\nA leader and innovator in the web3, DeFI, and DAO landscape, [Cooper](https://alias.co/coopahtroopa/) is one of the most well-respected minds in the space.

{"id": "Ej_3ZbMy4FACD5OyZYlfMkZzhYV-v5evCE8Eu5oEbGw", "title": "Introducing Value Physics", "body": "Authors: BlockchainJames \\[James Waugh\\], nintynick \\[Nick Naraghi\\], Cryptnotiq \\[Ian\\], Metadreamer, Puniaviison \\[Punia\\]\n\n# Why\n\nWe believe that the nexus of web3 technology, self-enlightenment, and environmental-economic conditions places humankind in the midst of a radical point in human evolution that can alter societies for millennia to come.\n\nOur mission is to build models which can aid individuals from any background, socioeconomic class, or location to help build a global collective consciousness that can never be brought down by any ‘corrupt’ centralized power.\n\nWe fundamentally believe that each one of us has a light within us. When that light is recognized and aligned with the world we are able to produce our life’s work, and humanity as a whole evolves.\n\nMaking that ascension into our higher selves is an internal journey that can be influenced by external conditions. Meeting a spiritual guide, finding people you love working with, or devoting yourself to cause you deeply believe in are all examples of things we’re able to achieve when we have that alignment.\n\nAchieving that for every human in the world is the end game for human coordination.\n\n# How\n\nThis is done by stacking humans that are on the same wavelength in specific environments that stimulate a collective consciousness.\n\nThe metaverse brings people together like never before and allows the free flow of information and thought; however, we believe that there is a major missing factor here which is the physical environment. Even if a group is on the same wavelength, in their remote discussions they have different external stimuli affecting them subliminally which prevents them from truly reaching a collective conscious.\n\nWe hypothesize that bringing a similar group to a specific geographic location for short periods of time enables them to reach a new level of groupthink which can have exponential returns compared to remote communication. These can be short-lived experiences of a few days at a time to reach this new state of mind, then the ideas can be implemented remotely in-home locations until the time arises where another group thinks the session is required to push forward.\n\nJust how like SF grew to be a collective of minds, capital, all stacked in one location to advance technology across the world like never before, we are envisioning creating a decentralized version of this for spreading web3 technology at an even faster rate, where we can stack the required humans in locations (even if only temporarily) to create the same effect but on a highly global and integrated level where there are very low barriers to entry and anyone can participate.\n\n# What\n\nValue physics is a weird phrase, what does it mean?\n\nValue physics seeks to define the relationship between people and how they coordinate - with “value” being the elementary particle by which this coordination happens. Drawing parallels with physics - similar to how the photon is the elementary particle that carries the electromagnetic force.\n\nOutside of making us seem way smarter than we actually are, we find that the analogy with physics is useful in helping us create a mental model for how value works and how to explore it.\n\nSomething we have to work on to create a common understanding of is what we mean when we talk about “value”. A provisional definition we are playing with is: Value is the emergent benefit that emerges out of action.\n\nAn example being: a woodcutter chopping down a tree to create wood. Extra value is created by the action that is greater than the tree or the person by itself.\n\nAs societies and economies emerge and grow more complex, we find the locus of value not being in the direct interaction between a person and a resource, but rather in the interaction between people.\\*\\*\n\\*\\*\n\nWe think about coordination as the set of underlying values, stories, principles, and institutions that support our ability to work together. All of which create our equivalent to the laws of physics that govern the material world.\n\n# Coordination\n\nCoordination between people to accomplish shared goals is the largest creator and driver of value that we have today. As such, improvements in coordination are incredibly high leverage and massively important as they ripple to every corner of the modern economy.\n\nIn the economic sense, the idea of value is mostly abstracted by “the market” and exists as much more of a theoretical concept to most people. As economies grow more complex and global, this effect will only continue.\n\nThe market is a beautiful thing. Though flawed, through a mostly decentralized structure, it is able to aggregate the opinions, preferences, and beliefs of a wide swath of economic participants into a unit of account that is able to be relationally compared to other prices to understand relative value. Super dope!\n\nCurrently, most of the market is represented by stocks \\[and their associated derivatives\\] that embody the corporation. While those that trade and invest in stocks are ngmi, they represented a huge step function improvement with how we coordinated together. They enabled enterprising individuals to explore \\[and \\*cough\\* colonize \\*cough\\*\\] and map the world to eventually usher in an era of unprecedented globalization.\n\nThe issue with stocks though is that they are rigid. They exist as paper certificates that are digitally represented in silos within comatose and obscure institutions that literally no one has ever heard of \\[[DTCC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dtcc.asp)\\]. As such, they can’t really interact with the rest of society.\n\nThere's no way for Communities/Humans to truly get behind these projects more than simply buying x amount of stock. As an example, it is impossible for Coca-Cola to give a fractionalized share of their company back to a customer when they buy a drink. The cultural gap is also a large chasm to cross - AirBnB proposed giving shares to super hosts, but the proposal was [shot down](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/airbnb-wants-to-give-shares-in-its-business-to-hosts/).\n\n# Ethereum, ERC20 Tokens, and the Internet of Value\n\nWith ERC20 tokens, we see the coordination mechanisms of the joint-stock, open market era becoming digital. This means these mechanisms become orders of magnitude more fluid, flexible, and impactful. Another step-function improvement in coordination.\n\nUnderstanding this as simply something that takes a physical representation and turns it digital is accurate, but understated. When information became digital with the internet, we rapidly moved from newspapers to social networks within 10 years. Such is the profound level of change we can expect to come to coordinating value with the wider adoption of tokens.\n\nIn studying Value Physics, within the new paradigm of the ERC20 token, we want to describe the underpinnings of token economies and what they are capable of doing. One way we approach describing this theoretical framework is by doing value experiments. In a similar vein to how aspects of physics are understood and described.\n\n# Value Experiments\n\nWe aren’t really the first ones to propose the idea of doing value experiments. Though, it may never have previously been described as such.\n\nThere is a long legacy of experiments we can look at in the crypto space:\n\n1. Tokens as a fundraising mechanism.\n   1. Pioneered through the ICO in the 2017-ish era.\n2. Token games leveraging human psychology to produce emergent effects.\n   1. Pioneered by Team JUST most famously through[ FOMO 3D](https://news.bitcoin.com/fomo3d-team-launch-new-dapp-thats-not-just-a-game/).\n      1. Attempting to define an AI that builds itself by coordinating the people creating the game. Some trippy shit!.\n3. Liquidity mining.\n   1. Pioneered by Synthetix and [Compound](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/06/25/liquidity-mining-with-compound-finance-just-a-fad-or-the-latest-toolbox-after-ieo-icos/).\n      1. Kicking of DeFi summer!\n4. Targeted Airdrops.\n   1. Unclear who really pioneered it, but [Handshake](https://medium.com/coinmonks/understanding-the-handshake-airdrop-and-reserved-names-428d9e90b560) and Uniswap were the early, prominent examples.\n5. DAO coordination.\n   1. What was first described by ‘The DAO’ coordinating as a community means social capital & financial capital can be combined to create exponential organizations.\n   2. Tangible examples of this are MetaCartel, MetaCartel Ventures, etc.\n6. Web3 development.\n   1. Value incentives for more meta coordination. Pioneered by[ MetaFactory](https://www.metafactory.ai/).\n      1. Giving back tokens to those that buy their products, to contractors that they work with, etc.\n      2. DamagedGoods’/MF idea of giving tokens to those that RETURN damaged, stained, no longer fitting MetaFactory clothes.\n\nThe scale of experimentation we are able to conduct on the idea of value through tokens and related pieces of blockchain infrastructure vastly exceeds anything we were able to do in the past. For that reason alone we can’t help but feel incredibly bullish on our collective future here.\n\nThere is so much to be learned by experimenting and understanding the experiments that came before us!\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe seek to understand Value Physics so that we may improve the way by which we coordinate. We do this so that builders may use this information to coordinate to solve all of our current most pressing issues. Coordinating humans and ideas is the single most important way to drive forward a brighter future - now we have digital value to do this.\n\nThings like:\n\n1. Global Warming\n2. Natural Resource Depletion\n3. Degradation of Institutions\n4. Monopolization of Power\n\nFor that, we are excited!", "timestamp": 1635180072, "digest": "mfQHjcr1Ealb4CGQCOQe5hIMZWzoj5v5suIagYTWaT0", "contributor": "0x421f223e19877D9765Ecd6e8EC4812457229B36A"}
{"id": "E6LWzbjTV1bi9RwNOETc0rLC2j_Hu6kZRUnr6NXkKp0", "title": "STARS Token Distribution", "body": "Stargaze is one of the first NFT markets to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Cosmos is a network of custom interoperable blockchains. It is currently the second largest ecosystem by volume, and includes Terra, Cosmos Hub, Thorchain, and Osmosis.\n\nStargaze aims to be a decentralized NFT market, totally owned and governed by its users. Therefore, distribution of STARS has to be equitable, accessible, and cover a large surface area.\n\n## Token Release Schedule\n\nA fair initial distribution is pivotal in setting the future direction of a network. Paired with a thoughtful inflationary release schedule, a network can optimize its token distribution.\n\nThe distribution of STARS is designed to front-load inflation in order to bootstrap the network. This is a similar issuance schedule to Bitcoin. However, instead of halvings, issuance will be cut by 1/3 each year (by multiplying the current issuance by a reduction factor of 67%). Osmosis was the first protocol to use a [“thirding” token release schedule](https://medium.com/osmosis/osmo-token-distribution-ae27ea2bb4db) and heavily inspired Stargaze’s design.\n\nFor some background on using token incentives to bootstrap new networks, check out this great [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619?s=20) by Chris Dixon.\n\n![\"Thirding\" release schedule](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TwRgLvwwmYuxQ8c4BqR3f.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nStargaze will start with an initial supply of 1 billion STARS. An additional 1 billion STARS will be issued the first year. With this \"thirding\" schedule, the issuance for the following year will be 670M STARS. This leads to an **asymptotic max supply of 4.03 billion STARS**.\n\n![Max supply formula](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_q9lx8h-BE1KNjYqE-Cht.png?height=186&width=998)\n\n![Issuance calculations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vm2RIO5fD2J3EVOVRP01W.png?height=1916&width=1592)\n\nStargaze starts off decentralized on day one with a genesis supply that distributes the majority of the tokens to community members. The Foundation will hold a strategic reserve of tokens, and will drive adoption of the protocol by delegating to validators, onboarding creators, and providing grants for ecosystem development.\n\n![Community-focused genesis supply](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tQ6Q0otaxfb8_7aCc4_GN.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter 5 years, the initial distribution is only 27.6% of the entire token supply. This issuance schedule allows Stargaze to grow and adapt its ownership to new creators, curators, validators, delegators, and other stakeholders.\n\n![Genesis supply vs. new issuance after 5 years](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k_VH9Rk86klZ7IXo2ZbKC.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\n## Airdrop\n\nThe goal of the Stargaze airdrop is to reach the most active participants in the Cosmos ecosystem. Stakers and liquidity providers are more likely to be more active than just token holders. Therefore, Stargaze is doing its airdrop to a mix of network participants:\n\n* **ATOM stakers**\n* **OSMO stakers or liquidity providers**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Cosmos Hub**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Osmosis**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Regen Network**\n\nFor each role above, you will be able to claim **1,998 STARS**. Distributing a fixed amount is in the spirit of the original Uniswap airdrop, giving every user more or less an equal starting point. In order to claim your airdrop, you have to perform 4-5 actions on Stargaze when it launches. If you have used [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) or [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), you’re already familiar with performing tasks to claim tokens. Some claimable actions include bidding on NFTs, staking, and voting in governance.\n\nSome minimums were put in place to prevent dust accounts and those attempting to game airdrops:\n\n* **ATOM staker: 5 ATOM minimum staked**\n* **OSMO staker: 50 OSMO minimum staked**\n\nFurthermore, delegations to centralized exchange validators were excluded.\n\nFor example, if you’re an ATOM staker and OSMO LP, and meet the above minimums, then your airdrop reward is 3,996 STARS.\n\nOsmosis liquidity providers get the airdrop regardless if LP tokens are bonded or not.\n\nAirdrop claimable amounts start decaying 4 months after the launch of the NFT market. The decaying process linearly decreases the claimable amount for another 4 months.\n\n![Airdrop must be claimed to prevent decay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3_QgqhG1LETOtyBdL0a7P.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter the airdrop claim period, unclaimed STARS are sent to the Community Pool.\n\nSnapshots were taken on Oct 11th, 2021 from Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and Regen Network.\n\nTo see how much STARS you’re eligible to claim, please visit <https://stargaze.zone/airdrop>.\n\n***Note: Airdrops won’t be claimable until after Phase 3 of launch. Please see Phase 3 below.***\n\nhttp://stargaze.zone/airdrop\n\n## Reward Distribution\n\nNew token reward distribution will be optimized to facilitate the operations of the NFT market.\n\nThe initial breakdown per block will be:\n\n![Per block distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xrv9XI2xT80LipoquJqCl.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAll chain parameters can be changed via governance vote. Everything suggested in this post are sensible defaults. We expect governance to adapt and change the protocol as it matures.\n\n### NFT Incentives\n\n45% of block rewards are set aside for NFT bidding and staking incentives. Token holders will be able to earn yield by bidding and staking on NFTs for certain periods of time. An upcoming post will outline this mechanic in detail.\n\nIf governance determines that NFT incentives are too high for achieving the desired effect of the protocol, they may direct these incentives towards the Community Pool where they can be spent later.\n\n### Staking Rewards\n\nAs per the course with proof-of-stake networks, validators (node operators) earn rewards for securing the network. They also accept delegations from token holders, and charge a small commission for providing the service.\n\nNearly 100 validators were selected to join mainnet after 3 testnets, 2 of which were incentivized. They will earn 40% of all block rewards.\n\n### Developer Rewards\n\nInitially, 10% of block rewards will go to fund those that contribute to the development of Stargaze. Each account gets a specific weight set by governance. When a developer is no longer contributing, governance can choose to modify their weight or remove their allocation.\n\n### Community Pool\n\nThe Community Pool is the main DAO that operates the network. It is responsible for voting on parameter changes, software upgrades, community matters, and more. It will receive 5% of all block rewards.\n\n## Phased Launch\n\nSince Stargaze is a layer 1 blockchain with many moving parts, it will launch in phases.\n\n* **Phase 0: Chain launch with 0% inflation (Oct 29th)**\n* **Phase 1: Liquidity pools on [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and [Gravity DEX](https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/)**\n* **Phase 2: Governance proposal to enable inflation**\n* **Phase 3: Web app launch with first NFT drop**\n\nMore details about the liquidity pools will be forthcoming. Please follow us on social media (links below) for updates. They are planned for 2-3 weeks after Phase 0, and have to go through governance to be funded via the Community Pool.\n\nNew tokens won’t be issued until after Phase 2, when inflation kicks in. At this time you’ll be able to stake STARS at [stargaze.zone](http://stargaze.zone/) via [Keplr Wallet](http://keplr.app/).\n\nPhase 3 is expected to be completed before the end of the year. Airdrops will be claimable starting in this phase.\n\n## Follow Us\n\nTo follow along with Stargaze developments, check us out on Twitter at <https://twitter.com/StargazeZone>, and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StargazeZone\n\n[https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE)\n\nHappy Stargazing ✨🔭", "timestamp": 1635180423, "digest": "h9Bc7jODUrYB1Jw4mve3QEGVkBwBsyVebN6NP7tRl_Y", "contributor": "0x57a9Cb03cC8Ed919162d9024710ca9E886346299"}

{"id": "VCl8u4sI9q0M-35HiY1nkOizMVFqMikcH-I1Bf3VMX4", "title": "STARS Token Distribution", "body": "Stargaze is one of the first NFT markets to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Cosmos is a network of custom interoperable blockchains. It is currently the second largest ecosystem by volume, and includes Terra, Cosmos Hub, Thorchain, and Osmosis.\n\nStargaze aims to be a decentralized NFT market, totally owned and governed by its users. Therefore, distribution of STARS has to be equitable, accessible, and cover a large surface area.\n\n## Token Release Schedule\n\nA fair initial distribution is pivotal in setting the future direction of a network. Paired with a thoughtful inflationary release schedule, a network can optimize its token distribution.\n\nThe distribution of STARS is designed to front-load inflation in order to bootstrap the network. This is a similar issuance schedule to Bitcoin. However, instead of halvings, issuance will be cut by 1/3 each year (by multiplying the current issuance by a reduction factor of 67%). Osmosis was the first protocol to use a [“thirding” token release schedule](https://medium.com/osmosis/osmo-token-distribution-ae27ea2bb4db) and heavily inspired Stargaze’s design.\n\nFor some background on using token incentives to bootstrap new networks, check out this great [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619?s=20) by Chris Dixon.\n\n![\"Thirding\" release schedule](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TwRgLvwwmYuxQ8c4BqR3f.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nStargaze will start with an initial supply of 1 billion STARS. An additional 1 billion STARS will be issued the first year. With this \"thirding\" schedule, the issuance for the following year will be 670M STARS. This leads to an **asymptotic max supply of 4.03 billion STARS**.\n\n![Max supply formula](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_q9lx8h-BE1KNjYqE-Cht.png?height=186&width=998)\n\n![Issuance calculations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vm2RIO5fD2J3EVOVRP01W.png?height=1916&width=1592)\n\nStargaze starts off decentralized on day one with a genesis supply that distributes the majority of the tokens to community members. The Foundation will hold a strategic reserve of tokens, and will drive adoption of the protocol by delegating to validators, onboarding creators, and providing grants for ecosystem development.\n\n![Community-focused genesis supply](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tQ6Q0otaxfb8_7aCc4_GN.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter 5 years, the initial distribution is only 27.6% of the entire token supply. This issuance schedule allows Stargaze to grow and adapt its ownership to new creators, curators, validators, delegators, and other stakeholders.\n\n![Genesis supply vs. new issuance after 5 years](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k_VH9Rk86klZ7IXo2ZbKC.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\n## Airdrop\n\nThe goal of the Stargaze airdrop is to reach the most active participants in the Cosmos ecosystem. Stakers and liquidity providers are more likely to be more active than just token holders. Therefore, Stargaze is doing its airdrop to a mix of network participants:\n\n* **ATOM stakers**\n* **OSMO stakers or liquidity providers**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Cosmos Hub**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Osmosis**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Regen Network**\n\nFor each role above, you will be able to claim **1,998 STARS**. Distributing a fixed amount is in the spirit of the original Uniswap airdrop, giving every user more or less an equal starting point. In order to claim your airdrop, you have to perform 4-5 actions on Stargaze when it launches. If you have used [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) or [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), you’re already familiar with performing tasks to claim tokens. Some claimable actions include bidding on NFTs, staking, and voting in governance.\n\nSome minimums were put in place to prevent dust accounts and those attempting to game airdrops:\n\n* **ATOM staker: 5 ATOM minimum staked**\n* **OSMO staker: 50 OSMO minimum staked**\n\nFurthermore, delegations to centralized exchange validators were excluded.\n\nFor example, if you’re an ATOM staker and OSMO LP, and meet the above minimums, then your airdrop reward is 3,996 STARS.\n\nOsmosis liquidity providers get the airdrop regardless if LP tokens are bonded or not.\n\nAirdrop claimable amounts start decaying 4 months after the launch of the NFT market. The decaying process linearly decreases the claimable amount for another 4 months.\n\n![Airdrop must be claimed to prevent decay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3_QgqhG1LETOtyBdL0a7P.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter the airdrop claim period, unclaimed STARS are sent to the Community Pool.\n\nSnapshots were taken on Oct 11th, 2021 from Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and Regen Network.\n\nTo see how much STARS you’re eligible to claim, please visit <https://stargaze.zone/airdrop>.\n\n***Note: Airdrops won’t be claimable until after Phase 3 of launch. Please see Phase 3 below.***\n\nhttp://stargaze.zone/airdrop\n\n## Reward Distribution\n\nNew token reward distribution will be optimized to facilitate the operations of the NFT market.\n\nThe initial breakdown per block will be:\n\n![Per block distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xrv9XI2xT80LipoquJqCl.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAll chain parameters can be changed via governance vote. Everything suggested in this post are sensible defaults. We expect governance to adapt and change the protocol as it matures.\n\n### NFT Incentives\n\n45% of block rewards are set aside for NFT bidding and staking incentives. Token holders will be able to earn yield by bidding and staking on NFTs for certain periods of time. An upcoming post will outline this mechanic in detail.\n\nIf governance determines that NFT incentives are too high for achieving the desired effect of the protocol, they may direct these incentives towards the Community Pool where they can be spent later.\n\n### Staking Rewards\n\nAs per the course with proof-of-stake networks, validators (node operators) earn rewards for securing the network. They also accept delegations from token holders, and charge a small commission for providing the service.\n\nNearly 100 validators were selected to join mainnet after 3 testnets, 2 of which were incentivized. They will earn 40% of all block rewards.\n\n### Developer Rewards\n\nInitially, 10% of block rewards will go to fund those that contribute to the development of Stargaze. Each account gets a specific weight set by governance. When a developer is no longer contributing, governance can choose to modify their weight or remove their allocation.\n\n### Community Pool\n\nThe Community Pool is the main DAO that operates the network. It is responsible for voting on parameter changes, software upgrades, community matters, and more. It will receive 5% of all block rewards.\n\n## Phased Launch\n\nSince Stargaze is a layer 1 blockchain with many moving parts, it will launch in phases.\n\n* **Phase 0: Chain launch with 0% inflation (Oct 29th)**\n* **Phase 1: Liquidity pools on [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and [Gravity DEX](https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/)**\n* **Phase 2: Governance proposal to enable inflation**\n* **Phase 3: Web app launch with first NFT drop**\n\nMore details about the liquidity pools will be forthcoming. Please follow us on social media (links below) for updates. They are planned for 2-3 weeks after Phase 0, and have to go through governance to be funded via the Community Pool.\n\nNew tokens won’t be issued until after Phase 2, when inflation kicks in. At this time you’ll be able to stake STARS at [stargaze.zone](http://stargaze.zone/) via [Keplr Wallet](http://keplr.app/).\n\nPhase 3 is expected to be completed before the end of the year. Airdrops will be claimable starting in this phase.\n\n## Follow Us\n\nTo follow along with Stargaze developments, check us out on Twitter at <https://twitter.com/StargazeZone>, and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StargazeZone\n\n[https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE)\n\nHappy Stargazing ✨🔭", "timestamp": 1635181862, "digest": "h9Bc7jODUrYB1Jw4mve3QEGVkBwBsyVebN6NP7tRl_Y", "contributor": "0x57a9Cb03cC8Ed919162d9024710ca9E886346299"}

"![](https://oss02.bihu.com/image/20191013/59584349a0cea2dd48f5fbe14b6478bf_GY2DAKRRGA3TK.jpg)\n\n比特傻少年时，看到金庸先生的《天龙八部》，扫地僧讲解七十二绝技。少林寺七十二绝技，每一招都是凌厉狠毒；每修炼一层，则戾气增进一分。如果没有修行佛法化解，则修炼者必受尽折磨，痛苦不已。现代社会，资金盘就是类似七十二绝技一般的存在。研习资金盘，需要有足够的自控力和强健的世界观，否则很容易误入歧途。\n\n这段日子，好多读者催我写长文。感恩币乎平台，让我们有缘可以一起进步。上一篇我们已经讲了资金盘的基础认知，今天我会以更大的视角、更加深入剖析资金盘。今天比特傻会告诉大家四种资金盘。不知这篇文章能够在网络保存多久，你能否读到，就看缘分了。\n\n资金盘分类\n\n小时候，比特傻读历史。读到始皇帝设立中央和地方的政治制度。中央是三公诸卿制度。三公总领国政、太尉是最高军事长官、御史大夫监察百官。地方上是郡县制度。把国家权利这么分类，这简直是天才的分类法。比特傻觉得始皇帝不仅仅军事才能卓越；而且政治制度创新也是千古一帝，后来的帝王首脑都难以与之相提并论。政治制度的设计本质是是对整个国家一团乱麻一样的权利进行分类，然后分配。你肯定觉得这又何难？你去看看隔壁的罗马帝国，分崩离析，就没有这样福泽千年的政治遗产。我们的确是神佑的民族。\n\n那币圈的资金盘该怎么分类呢？有人张口就来，说分为良心盘和黑盘。良心盘按照资金盘的套路玩，最终钱不太好募了，入不敷出时卷款跑路。黑盘呢，一上来所有散户和资金盘猎人一把割，1-2个月就跑路。良心盘让赌徒潦倒一生，但当下看是可接受损失。黑盘呢，好家伙，2个月后你第一次提现，就提现不了了。你痛苦万分时，朋友圈里你的下线还在不停发\"XX互助，请别再错过！\"，简直是魔幻现实主义。连对人生最不负责任的赌徒都要骂上一句：，这也割的太狠了嘛。\n\n可是你这么简单分类啊，就无法看到资金盘更辽阔更深邃的世界。且看比特傻的分类法。\n\n经典资金盘\n\n类似3M互助和易租宝这样的，我把它们叫做经典资金盘。常见的经典资金盘，首先有个温暖的口号，来慰藉赌徒的道德感。比如\"善心汇\"、\"人人有书读\"之类的。然后呢，经典资金盘会对你的投资行为、拉新行为进行激励。也就是说你投的越多，拉的人头越多，得到的收益就越高。\n\n经典资金盘一般有着明确的收益承诺，但都是些难以通过正常生意持续获得的收益。3M经典资金盘的收益来源也一般比较扯淡，通常都是靠后来者纳贡，或者少比例投资些不靠谱的项目。收益分配呢，就按照你投资或者拉新的多少以及你在金字塔中的位置进行分配。\n\n通常，经典资金盘会很顺畅地经历启动、拉新膨胀、资金枯竭、奔溃跑路等阶段。没有什么花头，也没有什么意外，无可欣赏之处。依葫芦画瓢，几无创新，十分类似庞氏当年的骗局，让比特傻这样的投资人厌倦。这真是资金盘里面最朴素的一种啊。\n\n弱铸币权资金盘\n\n弱铸币权资金盘在经典资金盘的基础上做了一个小小的变化。你的收益不再是账户余额了，而是可用于二级市场交易的代币。可别小瞧这个小小的变化，这直接导致资金盘属性发生了翻天覆地的变化。\n\n二级市场的代币代替了固定的账户余额，意味着资金盘运营者可以赖账了。本来，资金盘欠你10万块的收益没有给你，你可以不依不饶地找人家去兑现。现在好了，资金盘欠你10万个代币，现在每个币是一块钱。等到你过了提现限制时间，一个月后去提现的时候，每个币就一毛钱了。这下你慌了，人家大大方方告诉你，市场不好，再等几天吧。\n\n其次呢，这种赖账还体现在增发筹码上。运营方相当于在资金盘的小小的交易环境中有了自己的铸币权。我把这种局限的铸币权叫作弱铸币权。那好，有了铸币权自然是印钞了。你辛辛苦苦，吭哧吭哧得发展下线赚来1万枚代币。人家程序员改改代码，一下子增发一个亿的筹码揣兜里。\n\n其次呢，弱铸币权的资金盘还可以在二级市场可以放收益杠杆。本来呢，你为了吸引赌徒玩资金盘，整个盘子用户的待付余额50个亿，你去哪里把这50个亿的窟窿补上呢？有了弱铸币权就好办了，你可以用一个亿拉盘，代币价格蹭蹭往上账，每个人的资产价格都在上涨。上涨预期也稳定了提现数额。于是，你用很小的代价，让所有人获得了表象上的超额收益。这难道不是很美的事情吗？\n\n加特肯特正是因为这种弱铸币权的保障，导致弱铸币权资金盘的生命力比经典资金盘强悍了不少。\n\n强铸币权资金盘\n\n上文说到经典资金盘的拉新，必须要用实打实的收益给高度的激励；弱铸币权的资金盘拉新必须在二级市场拉盘，给人以财富效应；强铸币权资金盘往往伴随着强大的行政能力，能够充分垄断地捆绑在经济这台永动机之上。其拉新方式具有强制性。比如社保公积金，小白领上班不得不交、直接给你扣了；Vc/Pe、房地产都是印钞式拉新，你不理不顾不要紧，直接印钞稀释你的财富，印的钱进入这些领域。\n\n说一句诺贝尔经济学家也说不出来的话。铸币权的强弱本质上在于：能不能绑上一国经济这台永动机。\n\n世间只有一个永动机，那就是源于人类本性孜孜以求的生存和发展。是的，经济体的发展就是永动机。资金盘绑上这台永动机，操作得当，就可以割之不尽，取之不竭。2009年以前，资金盘绑上永动机，都是在最终暴力的支持下，行政权力辅助造成的经济体内的货币垄断模式。控制货币方收割不控制货币的一方。但2009年以后，终于出现了比特币，其去中心化让最终暴力无从碾压，得以生存至今。这个下文再说。\n\n强铸币权往往伴随着强大的行政权力配套。强大的行政权力，可以限制市场的交易行为，可以确立货币作为唯一代币的垄断性，甚至可以向社保公积金那样强制拉新。怕喝咖啡，这里就不展开了。补充一句，广义上，比特傻认为资金盘是中性词。很多强铸币权资金盘运作的好，也能改善国计民生，有利于财富再分配，有利于科技行业发展。\n\n为了方便大家理解，我们就以地产这个跨越好几代人的强铸币权资金盘为例吧。\n\n令我吃惊的房地产的收益承诺是隐形承诺就是房价不会跌且会随着M2上涨。房价跌了人民倾向于砸售楼处。托肯\n\n强铸币权嵌入token的方式:利用行政手段，在一二级市场做各种限购限贷措施，导致交易量变小，这样就可以少量资金拉盘房价上涨。\n\n房地产资金盘的收益来源是M2保障房价、租金和学区、医疗、户籍等福利;拉新方式是利用城镇化进程和M2蓄水池，强制拉新；提现限制有限售限贷，导致半年才卖得出去。：比克特，\n\n房地产资金盘的可玩性：拥有城市系统、地块系统、土拍系统、户籍系统、限购系统、限贷系统、产权系统、租赁系统、学区系统等多个系统，增加了资金盘可玩性。\n\n这样看来，房地产就是一个强铸币权加行政手段维护的强行拉盘、强行拉新、强行保障收益来源的资金盘。牛逼之处还在于政府可以通过\"可玩性\"中的各大系统干预价格，使得泡沫极难破灭。而且啊，各类型的场外配置手段也被行政权力约束。\n\n这还不算完。你在各类型房地产平台看到的价格都是相互矛盾的。有时候统计局说房价在跌，可是你在小区的真实感受是房价在涨。价格显示都不准，所有参与者都在抹黑开车，神奇吧。\n\n那强铸币权资金盘是否就万无一失了呢？不是的。在强铸币权的情况下，资金盘的体量占铸币权的经济体的体量，占比越小越安全。还是用房地产举例。尽管房地产不全是资金盘，但房地产中的货币和信贷水池及房地产的投机需求无疑是资金盘的一部分。目前房地产及其相关行业占国民经济小一半，就足够让政府心慌了。开始出台各种限购限贷限售限价限离措施。有些资金盘啊，你惹不起，政府也惹不起。不信你看隔壁日本。虽然比特傻不是房v，但是以上用资金盘视角对房地产，在房圈也是独一无二，足以给人启迪。\n\n区块链技术资金盘\n\n区块链技术再次使得资金盘模式得到巨大的进步，典型的就是去中心化盘Fomo3D。\n\n首先，区块链技术使得一个弱小的项目方都可以发币，获得弱铸币权。弱铸币权能够带来什么呢？能够通过二级市场拉盘来放大收益和赖账，这比传统狭义资金盘的资金流压力小，导致资金盘存续周期拉长。其呢，智能合约技术解决了资金盘跑路问题，即使奔溃也奔溃的明明白白，杜绝了人为跑路的风险，且保障了崩盘后收益分配的自动化和智能化。\n\n第三，在玩法上利用智能合约程序增加了很多趣味性，例如最终大奖、战队系统等。最后，这类资金盘敢于直接说自己就是资金盘，不像传统资金盘遮遮掩掩，搞啥大义名分。乃至很多参与者觉得这种盘强于绝大多数ICO，比很多发币的项目方更良心，玩资金盘甚至比炒币更公平，多劳多得。\n\n传统资金盘吧，总是一个庄家带着散户在玩。庄家总是中心化的。在区块链资金盘里，很多情况是散户和计算机算法在玩。庄变成了一套算法，变得去中心化了。福莫德，\n\n福莫德\n\n福莫这样会导致资金盘永不停息的。那怎么解释这样的资金盘会停止呢？\n\n首先，每一个网络都会存在衰退。接近上限资金就会枯竭。其次呢，筹码的价格会逐渐增高，在目测获得大奖的概率很低的情况下，就不再有人投入。第三，最最重要但没人说的原因：理智。人其实会在漫长的疯狂中恢复理智的。\n\n这导致了资金盘的传播发展是有边际效应的，到了一定规模每获取一个成员的成本就会高到大于其带来的资金投入。于是，最终会资金链断裂。当然，在那之前操盘者一定会跑路。\n\n比特傻从来不忌讳说比特币就是资金盘。黄金是资金盘、你的社保账户是资金盘、民国金圆券是资金盘、美元霸权是资金盘、人类社会生生不息发展是资金盘、物种演变是资金盘。和直觉不同，资金盘不一定是骗局。比特币是全球第一个技术手段实现的不可逆的大规模资金盘。\n\n比特币这种去中心化货币属性的资金盘也将会逐渐捆绑上经济体这台永动机。未来啊，也是割之不尽，取之不竭。区别在于，比特币破除了暴力者的空间，是先来者割后来者。这相对于目前的货币体系已是进步，已是进步了。\n\n历史上无数次案例政府利用货币坑百姓。之百姓参与货币民权和货币主权的争夺几千年了，之前最好的工具是黄金。于是黄金这个资金盘，可以几千年不灭亡。而现在，参与货币民权和货币主权的博弈，最好的工具就是比特币。很多情况资金盘是一种恶，但用作对抗更大的恶时，她就是天使。\n\n对了，比特傻再提醒你一句。绑上了国计民生、绑上了一国经济体的、不可逆的资金盘才是最好的投资标的。\n\n最后你可能会问了，如果把区块链技术和强铸币权结合会怎么样？问得好。这就是央行数字货币。是另外一个复杂体系，我们会在后面的文章中仔细去说。\n\n结语\n\n扫地僧说：佛法在求渡世、武功在求杀生。那怎么才能对天下苍生最好呢？主流教育告诉年轻人应该好好创造价值，远离资金盘。比特傻选择道出资金盘的奥义，告诉他们除了修行佛法练习七十二绝技，还可以利用小无相功，在短时间里速成，获得更大的威力。如何取舍，全凭自己。\n\n文章写到这里，已经颇为复杂了。比特傻且先做个小结。\n\n看资金盘啊，先看有没有在二级市场发币。发了币就可以在收益层面赖账、增发筹码和放大参与者的收益。再看有没有绑上经济体这个永动机。绑上了，资金盘就生生不息，通常伴随着标的物和一般等价物的两头垄断。而绑上永动机的手段分为行政权力和去中心化技术。前者往往局限于一国，后者理论上更加不可被消灭、能够跨越主权而存在。但技术手段和生态建设还处在早期。\n\n上一篇文章你学会了对资金盘的基础认知。这一篇你学会了用更大的视角，更深邃的角度看待资金盘。这个资金盘系列注定是充满争议的，但也是独一无二的。\n\n数字货币的大船正在暴雨惊涛中前进，而资金盘是大船边上的一叶扁舟。舟上虽有坐席，但切记，水能载舟，亦能覆舟。",

Kaum ein Mensch, der die Geschichte der Geschwister kennt, wird behaupten, dass obwohl, Abel der von Gott bevorzugte Bruder war, es Cain schlecht erging, absolut gesehen hatte er genau die gleichen materiellen Wohlstände wie sein Bruder, aber relativ gesehen und das ist der springende Punkt, eben nicht. Cain, der wohl der erste Narzisst der Menscheitsgeschichte war, erachtete sich als besser, jemand dem mehr zu steht, knapp gesagt eine von Arroganz und Hybris geplagte Seele. \n\n*“Der Ausdruck Narzissmus steht  im weitesten Sinne für die Selbstverliebtheit und Selbstbewunderung eines Menschen, der sich für wichtiger und wertvoller einschätzt, als urteilende Beobachter ihn charakterisieren.”* Nun werden einige Leute, sofern sie mit  Rene Girards mimetischer Theorie bekannt sind, bereits erahnen, welche Richtung dieser Artikel einschlagen wird , trotzdem möchte ich noch einmal einen Grundriss eben jener Theorie zügig paraphrisieren und dann ein Synoptikum zwischen Mord Narzissmus und Mimetik erstellen. \n\nLaut Girard stehen wir Menschen in ständigem Konkurrenzdenken, dem aber nicht genug konkurrieren wir auch noch um die Sachen, die anderer Leute Begehren sind wobei Girard  hier noch einen Schritt weitergeht und gar behauptet, dass der Mensch an sich keine wirklichen Wünsche und Verlangen hat sondern diese immer von anderen Menschen geprägt sind, also ein chaotisches Wechselspiel der Bedürfnise. Wenn wir dieses Konzept nun in unsere heutige Zeit, ein Äon der Negierung höherer Macht/Gottes, verlagern, sehen wir ganz klar und deutlich eine Deifizierung des Menschen. Denn wer ist den nun unser Maßstab nach, welchem wir uns richten sobald wir keinen Gott und dessen Regel akzepitieren? Der Mensch wird selber zum Maßstab, wir messen uns ständig mit anderen Menschen und legen dermaßen viel Wert auf deren Meinung, dass wir sie zu Ersatzgöttern oder besser gesagt Götzen empor gehoben haben, die nun uns beeurteilen obwohl wir ebenso ihn Konkurrenz mit ihnen stehen, pardaox nicht war. \n\nKommen wir nun also zur Verbindung dieser unheiligen Dreifaltigkeit im Lichte unserer Zeitepoche und warum dieser Trend wohl akkzelieren und sich fortsezten wird. Wie oben festgehalten beneidet Cain, Abel wegen eines Vergleiches, nicht mehr und nicht weniger, er vergleicht sich mit ihm, stellt fest dass er etwas anscheinend besseres besitze, ist voller Arroganz und entscheidet sich dafür Abel zu ermordern. Cains Narzissmus gepaart mit jenem Vergleichsdenken führende ihn dazu die wohl arroganteste Tat zu begehen und eine Menschenseele auszulöschen. Dieses Vergleichsdenken ist heute dank Social-Media omnipräsent, ebenso werden immer mehr und mehr narzisstische Charakterzüge an den Tag gelegt, generell sprechen manche Soziologen bereits von der narzistischten Generation schlecht hin und was am Anfang der Menscheitsgeschichte zu Blutvergießen geführt hat, kann auch heute wieder dazu führen.

Kurz gesagt ist es besser zu Kämpfen oder die Beine in die Hand zu nehmen und die Flucht nach vorwärts anzutreten, doch wie und wohin soll geflüchtet werden?\n\nMit dem Advent der Globalisierung, sowie dem endgültigen Sieg des Liberalismus, stellen sich nun einige vergleichsweise wenige Seelen, die Frage, wie sie diesem allesumschlingenden Levithian zu entkommen vermögen. Sich in Reih und Glied aufzustellen, die Kriegstrommeln zu schlagen und zu den Waffen zu greifen, mag zwar auf den ersten Blick heroisch wirken, doch bei genaurer Betrachtung, wird man bedauerlicherweise sehr schnell feststellen, dass es wenige, viel zu wenige Organisationen, Gruppen oder Indivdiuen gibt, die sich dem kontemporären Leitbild erfolgreich zur Wehr setzen könnten. Dies mag nun vielen von uns, dem liberalen Leitmotiv antipathisch, gegenüberstehnden, sauer aufstoßen und manch einen sogar, bei längerer Kontemplation, den Lebenssinn kosten, jedoch sollte diese, unsere Zeit, nicht als Kapitulations sondern als Äon der Neuformierung betrachtet werden. Seit geraumer Zeit nun pflegen es gewisse Gruppierungen, bei feindlicher Übernahme ihrer Heimat, in den Bergen Schutz zu suchen, umso der Annihilierung zu entgehen und sich von Neuem zu sammeln. Jene unnachgiebigen Individuen, setzen sich und davon bin ich überzeugt aus den elitärsten und vorzüglichsten Personen eines Volkes zusammen, ein Bund ideologisch,physich und psychisch abgehärteter, anti-nihilistischer langfristig zu denkend vermögender, Atlassen.\n\nNun ist es sicherliches kein Leichtes, sich über Jahre hinweg zwischen schroffen Gebirgswänden gefangen, dem überlegenen Gegner zu widersetzen, dabei nicht in eine Katz und Maus Spirale zu verfallen und sich für seine Rückkehr und all jenes was danach ansteht, vorzubereiten. Noch schwieriger ist es aber wenn man gar kein Regenwald, Gebirge oder sonstiges Rückzugsgebiet besitzt, selbst die Flucht wird zu einem Kampf, noch bevor die eigentliche Schlacht beginnt.\n\nDoch es wäre ein gewaltiger Trugschluss, sich der Ohnmächtigkeit in die Arme zu werfen und jegliche Hoffnung zu verlieren.

Forefront’s Season One was no exception.\n\nThroughout the season, our community was in the weeds of dozens of projects, initiatives, and discoveries. Every day there were new people to meet, new challenges to overcome, and new boundaries to push forward.\n\nIn order to keep progressing efficiently towards our mission of becoming the **“Port of Entry to Web3”**, we need to reflect, recover, and recalibrate.\n\nAs Season One comes to a close, we’re calling on our community to take some time to explore what made their Forefront experience great, provide insight about where we can improve, and shape where we go from here.\n\nFirst, let’s take some time to celebrate what we’ve accomplished.\n\n## Season One Highlights\n\n![Season One — Highlights](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vjsfewomFqroPlrJTi3cb.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\n[Forefront Season One](https://ff.mirror.xyz/Fj6LKnH1FSwz5eFaHBNuvChhn1Z_nA82w7FthkOV8Hg) was titled Enter the Forge. Our goal was to begin to build the teams and structures necessary to grow Forefront into a DAO powerhouse. It is unbelievable to think about all we’ve achieved in the last three months.\n\n### DAO Contributors\n\nThe Forefront DAO grew from just 5 core contributors in the Pre-Season to now 29 contributors spread across three Guilds. Our Culture Guild took the lead on building out a formal onboarding process, helping new members gain context, meet other contributors, and complete bounties as a pathway to becoming a contributor. In parallel, we build out a contributor rewards structure with base allocations, project rewards, and an end-of-season Coordinape pool.\n\nIn part thanks to the treasury diversification round, Forefront was also able to [onboard](https://snapshot.org/#/ffdao.eth/proposal/QmejUFkTFzhWS3McVpYbfX3C4u1cBLSFqqfqysvXe3rrL5) its first official Full- and Part-Time Core Contributors to the DAO who can be paid (partially) in USDC. These Contributors have each made long-term commitments to pushing forward high-level DAO initiatives and helping coordinate Guild activities.\n\nThe strides we’ve taken to empower and retain talent to put Forefront in an exciting position moving forward. While there is plenty to improve, we are extremely optimistic for what is to come.\n\n### Projects & Initiatives\n\nWhile the newsletter was one of Forefront’s core “products” heading into Season One, the team managed to ship at an insane rate throughout the last three months, dramatically expanding our reach and workload.\n\nFirst, Forefront pushed the boundaries of DAO culture with our FF Birthday Celebration. This was a multi-day digital event with games, competitions, DJ sets, and so much more. Be on the lookout for [Forefront DAOlloween](https://metaverse.forefront.club/) coming this month.\n\nFrom a content perspective, Season One saw the launch of some major new media pillars:\n\n* [Forefront Learn,](https://forefront.market/learn) a comprehensive resource to go from zero to DAO contributor by learning about social tokens, DAOs, and more.\n* [Forefront Podcast](https://forefront.market/newsletter), which includes high-quality recordings of our weekly FF Hangouts + weekly news wrap-ups of the crypto space at large.\n* [Forefront Wrapped](https://forum.forefront.news/d/43-forefront-wrapped-5), our weekly DAO summary for contributors and lurkers alike to be able to stay up-to-date on all things happening in the Forefront DAO.\n\nThere are plenty more projects in the works, all with the mission of making Forefront the port of entry for web3.\n\nFinally, Forefront had some in-person fun this Season as well! FF Contributors attended and [spoke at MCON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=797dfjgF1wg), and we’ll be making some moves at LisCon as well.\n\n### Treasury Diversification\n\nThe beginning of Season One kicked off Forefront’s [treasury diversification](https://ff.mirror.xyz/Yqo1j1RlCowOCRBnxupprIZ8w4RLRxit67x6pIK1hrA) round. A lot went into this process, including answering questions like who should we include in the round, how much should we raise, what should the terms be, and many more.\n\nEventually, with tons of community support, we landed on a $2.1M raise from dozens of strategic investors, angels, and community contributors. This addition to Forefront’s treasury will help us scale our effort, onboard full-time contributors, and continue to build at the cutting edge of DAOs.\n\nThe initial proposal was hosted on our Forum for community feedback. We then hosted 3 separate Hangouts in our Discord with many of the investors leading the round where community members could ask questions and submit ideas. Many changes were suggested, which we incorporated into the proposal. That final proposal was then voted on Snapshot before the process was kicked off. We’re proud to be able to involve so many community members in the process and in the round itself.\n\n### Growth\n\n![Season One — Snapshot](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WbWGOuDJXwrOJ5IcEKJE7.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nAs our output has increased, so has our impact. During season one our core contributors grew from 5 to 29 people (a 480% increase), who collectively earned 68,971 $FF in return for their efforts.\n\nAcross the 13 events and hangouts we ran in Season One we saw thousands of attendees and a truly insane roster of featured guests including Kei Kreutler, Toby Shorin, Ameer “Sirsu”, Patrick Rivera, John Palmer and Jarrod Dicker.\n\nBigger and bigger ships are bringing people to the shores of web3 and to new projects within it, and we’re thrilled that the leaders who are truly pioneering the space are coming to Forefront’s port to help guide them forward.\n\n## Introduction Off-Season\n\n![Off-Season Goals](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8wFm1pIBwf-hYsZ8A8KbJ.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\n### Off-Season Goals\n\nWhile we’re more excited than ever about the future of Forefront, we can’t move forward blindly. Planning for Season Two and beyond must be an intentional, community-driven effort. As such, we’re kicking off an “Off-Season” period featuring community feedback opportunities, North Star sessions, Values Design, and much more. The goal is to ensure that everyone’s voice is heard in imagining the future of Forefront. Be on the lookout in the Discord, newsletter, and forum for meeting dates!\n\nWe’ve been running full speed ahead for the last 3 months – this next period is a time to slow down, reflect, and reimagine. We’ll still be working hard to produce and ship as a DAO, but with a renewed focus on the future.\n\nWe are gently building each other up by strengthening our bonds through trust and vulnerability. It is imperative for longevity and community health that we build these Off-Season periods into the fabric of Forefront.\n\n### Off-Season Program:\n\n1. Reflection gatherings on Community Feedback;\n2. North Star workshop;\n3. Governance workshop;\n4. Season & Product roadmap workshop;\n5. Team Building & Health sessions;\n6. Party like it’s 1999;\n7. More TBD via community Vibez.\n\nOff-Season will officially starts October 28th and run for a period of about 5 weeks.\n\n### Community Feedback\n\nPlease take a few minutes to complete our Community Feedback Form. \n\nThis form is our first step in aggregating community feedback and insight to continue to grow and improve throughout the Off-Season and beyond. Regardless of whether you were a hardcore Season 1 Contributor or a lurker looking to get involved, definitely take some time to fill out the form!\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRFErRsBQ3rtb9volggxHG1fkS2FmZeTbU7Q1DcMiVPfS1aQ/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRFErRsBQ3rtb9volggxHG1fkS2FmZeTbU7Q1DcMiVPfS1aQ/viewform)\n\n## Season Two - Looking Ahead\n\nWhile there’s plenty to think through during the Off-Season, the Forefront community has already been thinking hard about what the future might look like.\n\n![Season Two — What's Next ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hIH7cQiezzoTsLfIn_ggJ.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nSome projects are already in the works across various Guilds. For example, we’re completely reimagining what Forefront’s DAO2DAO strategy looks like and how we can promote ecosystem-wide positive-sum games. We’re also working on product development (infrastructure for social token communities), public goods funding, new media experiments, and so much more.\n\n## Forefront Foundations\n\nForefront has come a long way, and we’re extremely excited for the future as we continue to grow and evolve, together.\n\nNow, more than ever, we’re calling on the larger web3 community to come join us in building a vibrant, positive, creative community. We are actively building the port of entry to web3, and we need everyone to do their part in achieving this goal.\n\nIf you’re interested in joining Season 2 reflection and planning sessions, have a project you’d like to work on with Forefront, or just want to join for the vibes, definitely stop by [our Discord](https://forefront.community)!\n\nForefront is shipping – we hope you’ll join us :)\n\n*Thank you to our evolving community and to all active contributors who made Season One possible: Caroline Nguyen, Jihad Esmail, Joey DeBruin, CPTN Skeletor, Grendel, Makoto Inoue, David Tomu, Rafael, Chase Chapman, Gian Ferrer, Mel Shields, Austin Robey, Marvin Lin, Sat Panesar, Eliot, Richard Patey, Rafathebuilder, Bee Bradley, Alex (Aureus), Kevinc, Snorky, Jacob, Meral, Tolu, Vooka, Milan, Isiah, Qhawe, Natalie, Carlos Gomes, Andy Tom, Jenil Thakker, and Nir Kabessa.*", "timestamp": 1635183570, "digest": "AVKMQHAdcSiyKwCBgV0dqsWckalKC9dPzIJLUNg_A9M", "contributor": "0xF0CAd7C8b383f79A879eB6Df644e336234EBDac8"}

Dieses Vergleichsdenken ist heute dank Social-Media omnipräsent, ebenso werden immer mehr und mehr narzisstische Charakterzüge an den Tag gelegt, generell sprechen manche Soziologen bereits von der narzistischsten Generation schlecht hin und was am Anfang der Menscheitsgeschichte zu Blutvergießen geführt hat, kann auch heute wieder dazu führen.

Der Mensch wird selber zum Maßstab, wir messen uns ständig mit anderen Menschen und legen dermaßen viel Wert auf deren Meinung, dass wir sie zu Ersatzgöttern oder besser gesagt Götzen empor gehoben haben, die nun uns beeurteilen obwohl wir ebenso ihn Konkurrenz mit ihnen stehen, paradox nicht war.\n\nKommen wir nun also zur Verbindung dieser unheiligen Dreifaltigkeit im Lichte unserer Zeitepoche und warum dieser Trend wohl akkzelieren und sich fortsezten wird. Wie oben festgehalten beneidet Cain, Abel wegen eines Vergleiches, nicht mehr und nicht weniger, er vergleicht sich mit ihm, stellt fest dass er etwas anscheinend besseres besitze, ist voller Arroganz und entscheidet sich dafür Abel zu ermordern. Cains Narzissmus gepaart mit jenem Vergleichsdenken führte ihn schlussendlich dazu die wohl arroganteste Tat zu begehen und eine Menschenseele auszulöschen. Dieses Vergleichsdenken ist heute dank Social-Media omnipräsent, ebenso werden immer mehr und mehr narzisstische Charakterzüge an den Tag gelegt, generell sprechen manche Soziologen bereits von der narzistischsten Generation schlecht hin und was am Anfang der Menscheitsgeschichte zu Blutvergießen geführt hat, kann auch heute wieder dazu führen. Auch wenn so einige moderne Zeitgenossen uns gerne von dem lächerlichen Gedanken überzeugen wollen, dass der Mensch sich verändert hätte und wirklich den Rang eines Gottes einnimmt.", "timestamp": 1635183858, "digest": "-H2DQQ_d7fkkSsL7SmHDug72n9oAWePXq-eWO1-85e4", "contributor": "0x79283d1eA9501d5997718837F2Fc21Ebed05F9D5"}

Bax\n\nAt [Convex Labs](https://www.convexlabs.xyz/), we’re NFT fanatics. We believe that NFTs can revolutionize the art and collectibles spaces.\n\nAs described in Paradigm’s *[Guide to Designing Effective NFT Launches](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/10/a-guide-to-designing-effective-nft-launches/)*, NFT launches are often unfair to the average user. Hasu and Anish Agnihotri describe several pitfalls which can give sophisticated users an edge and allow such users to extract value from both creators and other collectors.\n\nOne common design error is what Hasu and Anish Agnihotri term “exploitable fairness”. Part of the fun for buyers of NFTs is the “[gacha game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game)” aspect: buyers may get a common NFT, or if they’re lucky, they may get an NFT with rare traits, which can sell for several fold more than their common (“floor”) counterparts. To be fair, NFTs should be minted randomly. However, sophisticated users are constantly on the lookout for ways to increase their odds of minting or buying a rare NFT.\n\nWe have developed and deployed tools for the purpose of gaining an advantage when buying NFTs and we aren’t the only ones; we’ve observed others using such tools for months and recently numerous paid services such as traitsniper.com have appeared. Today, we’re open sourcing our tools, describing how we use them, and how we can detect when someone else has used similar methods to gain an advantage in an NFT launch.\n\nOur cheating tools work by finding metadata before it is available to the average user, and then using it to acquire more rare NFTs during the minting process, or by buying unrevealed NFTs before the metadata is uploaded on OpenSea. Similar cheating can also be carried out by project insiders.\n\nWe detected a lot of cheating using methods similar to ours and some instances are described here. Our hope is that spreading awareness about such tactics will prompt the NFT community to demand provably fair NFT drops.\n\n# How to use our tools to cheat at NFT launches\n\n**Step 1. Acquire metadata**\n\nFirst, you’ll need to find the token metadata for the collection you’re targeting. Check the token’s URI to see if it is pointing to an IPFS page or website with metadata. If it is, we’ve provided a script called *[pulling.py](https://github.com/Convex-Labs/honestnft-shenanigans/blob/master/metadata/pulling.py)* that takes the contract address as an input and then rapidly scrapes all of the metadata for an NFT collection.\n\n![Our pulling script takes the ERC-721 contract address as an input and then rapidly scrapes the metadata.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JeZ2agPJwtvgn_i9RV_Y0.png?height=925&width=1400)\n\nIf you can find the metadata before the initial sale is complete, then you’re golden — just proceed to step 2 to identify which NFTs are worth minting, and then try to mint those.\n\nWe’ve observed many different mechanisms that projects use to hide their metadata. The most common is to hide the metadata until after an NFT launch is complete and then update the metadata on the project’s website. In other cases, the metadata is stored on IPFS and updated by changing the base token URI. We’ve had some success finding leaked metadata by querying OpenSea’s API or by scouring testnets and Arweave, where devs occasionally leak the IPFS hash for their metadata. Even if this method doesn’t yield metadata, it can provide other valuable insights.\n\n![A sophisticated user describes the process they used to analyze an NFT project prior to its launch. (No metadata was leaked in this example.)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CVTx3sR3_jAJ6QFW9LJCR.png?height=750&width=591)\n\nSometimes we were unable to find the full metadata but were able to find leaking images. In this scenario, we just use a “for” loop to download all of the images, and then look through them manually for traits that we know are rare.\n\n![A simple for loop can be used to scrape leaking NFT images before minting and/or reveal.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/32p47OJPa3xtA1tcKE9mn.png?height=389&width=490)\n\nWe have also observed instances where we were unable to find leaking metadata, but someone else was still able to gain an edge in minting. There are numerous possible explanations for this observation. One is that we were unable to find publicly leaked metadata whereas someone else was. An alternative explanation is that an insider possessed information — insiders may be directly related to a project, or they could be a 3rd party that is hosting the project’s metadata.\n\n**Step 2. Calculate Rarity**\n\nThere is a strong correlation between NFT price and perceived “rarity.” The most widely used website for NFT rarity is rarity.tools, and they use the same algorithm to generate rarity ranks for almost every collection.\n\n![Sale price as a function of rarity rank for the last 200 MekaVerse NFTs sold. (As of 10/20/2021)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/94oBL-tHIpAQvvngJ1HMd.png?height=718&width=1036)\n\nOur *[rarity.py tool](https://github.com/Convex-Labs/honestnft-shenanigans/blob/master/metadata/rarity.py)* uses the metadata from step 1 as an input and then outputs the rarity score and rank for each NFT in a collection.\n\nOne thing to look out for is that the rarity score methodology does differ slightly; for some collections, rarity.tools uses “number of traits” as an attribute, but for others it doesn’t. Some collections also have custom rarity scores which will need to be scraped separately. Now that you have the rarity for every NFT in a collection, go on to step 3.\n\n*Note: we dislike rarity.tools’ ranking methodology but that’s a subject for a different article.*\n\nWe noticed that early on during NFT summer, a lot of NFT minters/buyers that we think were anomalously lucky weren’t using calculated rarity scores. Instead, we believe that they were simply scraping the metadata and looking for NFTs with a single very rare trait, as opposed to combinations of somewhat rare traits which together made an NFT rare. As time progressed, we noticed that some of the buyers began calculating rarity scores as described here.\n\n**Step 3. Minting or buying**\n\nNow that you have rarity data for the entire collection, it’s time to buy. If the collection is still in the minting phase, then you can try to mint the NFTs that you know are rare. To do this, check Etherscan manually, or better yet, write a bot that gets the tokenID of the last NFT that was minted. When the next NFT to be minted is the one you want, just send your minting transaction. Depending on the rate at which minting is occurring, this can be done manually or you may need to use a bot to time your transaction just right.\n\nBecause most launches allow batch minting, you may need to mint multiple common NFTs in order to snag a rare one. In some cases, you may also find multiple rare NFTs that you can mint in the same transaction, particularly when the NFTs aren’t randomly distributed.\n\n![This anomalously lucky user minted 5 BlazedCats. The 5th was rare and could be sold for a price that easily offset the cost of the other 4.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/apHe-1bcm4oDMPqVjOOrU.png?height=271&width=623)\n\nSince you know you’ll profit off the rare NFT, you can sell the other ones at or even below what you paid to mint them.\n\nThere is also one well-described example where someone used a [smart contract](https://github.com/Anish-Agnihotri/blog-effective-nft-launches-data/blob/master/01-exploitable-fairness/meebits/exploit.sol), along with flashbots, to guarantee that they only minted rare NFTs.\n\n**Step 4. Pre-reveal Sniping**\n\nEven if the mint phase of an NFT launch is concluded, or you weren’t able to obtain leaked metadata, you can still gain an edge in the next phase of the NFT launch. Many projects reveal their metadata after minting has concluded. However, there is a delay between when metadata becomes available and when OpenSea has finished updating. During this period, you can rapidly run the scripts we provided to obtain metadata and rarity scores and buy any rare NFTs that people listed for sale prior to reveal.\n\n# Detecting “Anomalously Lucky” NFT Buyers\n\nOur tools can also be used to detect buyers that we call “anomalously lucky.” To do this, you’ll need rarity data for an NFT collection, as well as a list of NFTs minted by each buyer.\n\nWe’ve provided rarity data for some projects on [github](https://github.com/Convex-Labs/honestnft-shenanigans/tree/master/metadata/rarity_data) or you can use our tools to get rarity data for other projects.\n\nOnce you have rarity data, the next step is to collect minting data for a collection as shown in [find_minting_data.ipynb](https://github.com/Convex-Labs/honestnft-shenanigans/blob/master/fair_drop/find_minting_data.ipynb). This will give you a database of every NFT minted by each account, and its rarity rank.\n\nEvery collection is different and you may need to tweak which statistical tests you’re using but we’ve provided some basic tools and data to help you get started.\n\nA good first start is to run a Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K-S) test on the minting database — we have an example of this in [ks_test.ipynb](https://github.com/Convex-Labs/honestnft-shenanigans/blob/master/fair_drop/ks_test.ipynb).\n\nThe “null hypothesis” that our [K-S test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test) is attempting to reject is that a user minted NFTs randomly. The K-S test checks whether the rarity rank of all NFTs minted by a user may arise from a uniform distribution. In certain cases, such as when NFTs weren’t randomly distributed or part of the collection was gifted instead of minted, the probabilities get more complicated and you may want to generate synthetic datasets which consist of the NFTs an account should have had a chance to buy.\n\n![A histogram showing the rarity ranks of DogeX NFTs minted by an anomalously-lucky user (red), and an average user (blue).](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aJgKPq00vtAJfwAQCClil.png?height=441&width=829)\n\nOur K-S test code will run through every account that minted multiple NFTs from a collection and outputs some data about the lucky accounts. Our code can also be modified to identify accounts which bought minted NFTs before the metadata reveal.\n\n![Example output for the two luckiest accounts that minted DogeX NFTs.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uFEnIj5Ry6RFeMWqHHmRp.png?height=277&width=531)\n\n![Blue dots represent each NFT in the DogeX collection. Black dots represent DogeX NFTs minted by an anomalously lucky account.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7IgHYqJ1wuozvfaK6mL9d.png?height=564&width=835)\n\nInterpreting the output of these statistical tests is nuanced. A p-value of 1E-5 does not guarantee that an account was grifting — if looking across hundreds of thousands of accounts, we would expect to occasionally find people who are that lucky. *(A p-value of 1E-22 on the other hand…)*\n\nWe also took a close look at several instances where members of the NFT community alleged that an account had grifted, and found that the accounts being accused were just slightly lucky (1% or 0.1% chance of occurring, absent additional non-statistical or off-chain evidence).\n\nThe K-S test may also give low p-values if the NFT collection itself wasn’t truly random. Conversely, just because an account *doesn’t* have an anomalously low probability also doesn’t mean that an account *wasn’t* grifting. In fact, we are confident that most of the accounts *we* used would not be identifiable by any statistical test, and we definitely aren’t the only ones clever enough to remain undetected.\n\n# More Shenanigans\n\nWe used our scripts to take a close look at many NFT drops. Most showed no signs of anomalies and probably were executed in a fair manner (although not provably so!) However, during the course of our research we observed several other types of anomalies.\n\n**Non-random distribution of traits**\n\nAs alluded to by Hasu and Anish Agnihotri, we also observed many NFT collections that did not have a random distribution of rarities. In certain cases, this means that sophisticated buyers can increase their odds of minting a rare NFT, even if they can’t guarantee the exact number they will receive because minting is occurring quickly.\n\n![Great Ape Society Bananas showed an unusual distribution of rarity ranks.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tzG-7Kq5c9of8yyoluhie.png?height=586&width=896)\n\n![Quaks had non-random rarity distribution. As a result, most users who minted towards the end of the launch would appear to be anomalously lucky.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IemNtLC_ZTjHvCnDVwsC2.png?height=426&width=694)\n\n**Non-Standard Minting Processes**\n\nWe observed numerous NFT launches where the minting process for rare NFTs was unusual and randomness was impossible to verify. For example, one project made unverifiable claims that users were randomly selected off-chain to receive the rarest NFTs in their collection. These NFTs had a significantly higher resale value than the remainder of the collection, which was minted “first come, first serve”.\n\n![Some projects have a special minting process for rare NFTs.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kkGKn_h0-n1_icwOcZsqq.png?height=539&width=845)\n\n![A Discord message from an NFT project leader which describes how they randomly selected accounts to airdrop the most valuable NFTs to, along with instructions for verifying that the airdrop was fair.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/v34BeuITm96BJNCSNK3KA.png?height=336&width=707)\n\nWe use a metric that we call the “first flip” metric to gauge how profitable minting and reselling is for a given collection. In this particular collection, about 50% of the total profit came from the NFTs that were distributed using the random selection process described in the Discord screenshot above. *Note:* *This metric can’t rule out wash trading.*\n\n![Screenshot showing the profit from reselling 8 Bit Universe NFTs after mint by token ID. About half of the first flip profits came from token IDs 1–100, which were given out after minting concluded.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-_FU5upuJ5021eDC9_JYm.png?height=823&width=1277)\n\n**Unverifiable Commits**\n\nWe observed several projects that claimed to be using a provably random [commitment scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme) to select NFT metadata where we were unable to find the commitment prior to token minting, nor were we able to verify that the metadata was generated after minting had concluded.\n\nWhenever a launch does not use a commitment-reveal scheme, it is impossible to rule out that project insiders are not changing metadata of NFTs they minted or bought on the post-secondary market.\n\n# How Can We Level The Playing Field?\n\nWe want the NFT space to succeed but we think that the shenanigans we have observed are extracting value from most users which is detrimental to the long-term health of the ecosystem.\n\n1. **Provable fairness:** Cryptographic schemes for provably fair NFT drops already exist and we have already seen some projects utilize them. We hope that by spreading awareness about information asymmetries in NFT metadata, consumers will demand provable fairness from projects they patronize. We would be happy to audit NFT launches with regards to randomness but ultimately we want consumers to learn about the magic of cryptography.\n2. **Fair metadata reveals:** Rather than relying on third parties such as OpenSea and rarity.tools to provide users with NFT metadata, projects should make NFT metadata available themselves immediately after it is revealed, thus negating part of the edge from scripts such as our [pulling.py](http://pulling.py).\n3. **Enough with the “first come, first serve” NFT launches:** As described in the Paradigm article, “first come, first serve” launches disadvantage the average user and revenue that could be going to artists and projects is instead going to miners. We didn’t go into it much in this article but we agree with Paradigm —please stop doing your launches that way!\n\n# Join Us\n\nWhat we’ve shown here is just the tip of the iceberg.

{"id": "Mlj8dim4xEcKY7c9_tIzcHdqs5EfRy9SpxTr0Egh4-A", "title": "NFTX：NFT定价与指数基金平台", "body": "NFT 指数基金以NFT合理定价为基础；NFT合理定价以NFT足够的流动性为基础。但须注意的是，不同类型的NFT只适用于不同的流动性协议**。影响**NFT的价格有内在和外在多维因素，其中外因对价格的影响有三个层次：干预价格、发现价格、获取定价权。\n\nUnicly：本质上仍是通过【市场拍卖机制】进行NFT的价格发现。亮点是市场传播干预定价：权益与治理代币的广泛流通——快速提高绑定NFT的市场热度和市场曝光——帮助NFT进入更大的市场获得更高出价——更多投机和治理代币价格继续上升——进一步炒作NFT。尽管这一自我强化的循环会在流动性代币帮助NFT进入“有效市场”后发生扭转，该机制的确适合需要更多人参与和推广的，流动性较差、炒作价值高、价格高的NFT，比如稀缺的数字艺术品。\n\nNFTX ：“同类池平均价”方法，弱化非同质代币之间的市场价格差值，从而增强流动性。这一类是通过【跨市场套利机制】进行价格发现，当流动性足够好可以获得定价权。对于价格相近，具有较大应用基础，需要保证交易前后完整性的NFT资产，适合用NFTX进行交易，比如游戏道具、头像等。\n\n### 业务模型\n\nNFTX是一个DAO拥有的，专注于为具有同等价值的 NFT 创建价格底线的平台协议，并且在此基础上发行同类NFT的指数基金的平台协议。\n\n解决的行业问题：\n\n• 需要大量的资本支出才能有获得高价 NFT 的机会，参与门槛太高\n\n• 缺少流动性，资金效率\n\n• 从而缺乏市场定价、难以估值，也无法成为抵押品，资金效率低\n\n**【定价：分类别的NFT收藏品池】**\n\n根据收藏品种类的不同，NFT 被分为了不同的收藏品池，任何人都可以把属于该收藏品类别的 NFT 锁进智能合约。\n\n1、类别可以做很细致的定义，比如Kitty Gen 0 仅包含元数据为 Generation 0 的 Kitty。\n\n2、vToken 是根据收藏品项目划分的。目前热度集中在头部项目。老牌的 NFT 项目如 CryptoPunks 和 AutoGlyph 的 vToken 市场表现最好。\n\n举例：\n\n1、铸造：用户可以将 1 个 CryptoPunk 锁进智能合约获得 1 枚 $PUNK（vtoken），这代表用户可以获得对应池子中任意1个cryptopunk。（V2功能引入了一个 Zap 合约，允许用户“Mint & Stake”不交铸币费（ 5%），即锁仓punk添加流动性至少48h，同时分流动性池的交易费；否则选择交5%的铸币费，得0.95vtoken，其中0.05的50%给流动性提供者）\n\n2、添加流动性：vToken 是基于 ERC-20 标准的同质化代币，首次发行的 vToken 需要在其平台内置的 SushiSwap AMM 添加币对并注入流动性以进行交易。\n\n3、赎回：vToken 的持有者可以支付 1 个 vToken 在对应的收藏品池中赎回一个随机的 NFT，也可以通过支付 1.05 个 vToken 购买一个池中指定的 NFT。\n\n总结：NFTX 的模型设计使 NFT 持有者有意愿将稀有度更低的 NFT 放到收藏品池以获得兑换收藏品池中其他稀有度更高的 NFT 的机会，**最终收藏品池中留下的都是稀有度最低、价格最低的收藏品。**再透过其 1:1 的 vToken 兑换比率，市场最终可以得到该收藏品相对公允的地板价（Floor Price），**这个价格理论上甚至比 OpenSea 的在售最低价更有参考价值。在流动性充足和收藏品池深度足够的情况下，vToken 可以实现作为 NFT 收藏品地板价指数的功能。**\n\n**【基金如何运作：D1和D2】**\n\nNFTX 基金分为 D1 和 D2 两种：\n\n• D1 是基础基金。其中的 ERC-20 代币与 NFT 抵押资产 1:1 铸造。例如， 用户有五个 NFTX 的基础 CryptoPunk 基金代币 (代币代码 :PUNK- BASIC)，就可以随时用这五个 PUNK-BASIC 代币兑换任意五个初级 CryptoPunk NFT。\n\n• D2 是复合基金。D2 中的代币由 D1 中的基础基金代币组合而成。例如， D2 的 PUNK 基金可由五种不同 D1 CryptoPunk 组成 (PUNK-BASIC、 PUNK-FEMALE、PUNK-ZOMBIE、PUNK-ATTR-4, PUNK-ATTR-5)。D2 交易对在Balancer设立资金池。\n\n**目前 D1 基金在 Balancer 开设了 ETH 交易对资金池：**\n\n• PUNK-BASIC/ETH \n\n• PUNK-FEMALE/ETH \n\n• PUNK-ATTR-4/ETH \n\n• PUNK-ATTR-5/ETH\n\n• PUNK-ZOMBIE/ETH\n\n下一步，开设 **D2 PUNK 基金交易对，将五个 D1 基金融合为 D2 单独交易对资金池。** 届时会创建 Balancer **资金池代币** (Balancer pool token，简称 BPT) 代表 CryptoPunk **指数基金，**持有者获得所有五种 D1 基金所有权。\n\n• PUNK-CORE里包含以上五种PUNK代币，其美金价值比例为1：1：1：1：1。赎回 PUNK 代币需要先解除 PUNK-CORE 封装，之后将 PUNK-CORE 退还给 Balancer 资金池销毁，就能获得对应的 D1 基金。后续在 NFTX 前端界面即可操作。  \n\n**NFTX的目标受众是谁？**\n\nNFTX 有三个主要目标受众：投资者、套利者和 NFT 流动性提供者。\n\n·希望购买和/或出售底价 NFT 的投资者而设计的，而无需等待二级市场上的bid\n\n·套利者，他们可以从 NFT 金库代币与其在二级市场上的基础抵押品的底价之间的价格变动中获利。套利者可以使用 nftx.org 上的产品直接与这些池进行交互。\n\n· NFT 流动性提供商，他们可以通过向一个或多个 NFT 金库提供额外的流动性和/或库存来获利。流动性提供者可以使用[nftx.org](https://app.nftx.org/)上的产品来铸造额外的 NFT 保险库代币，然后可以作为流动性提供。\n\n### 经济模型：筹资与代币经济\n\n$NFTX 是 NFTX 协议的治理代币。代币持有者在[Aragon NFTX DAO](https://www.qubi8.com/)对社区提案投票有投票权。目前提案需要有 80% $NFTX 持有人投票通过方可执行。包括去定义铸造和目标赎回的比例。\n\n**交易费用分配（暂未明确比例）：**\n\n[NFTX V1](https://v1.nftx.org/)不收取任何费用。\n\n[NFTX V2](https://app.nftx.org/)，保险柜创作者根据进出金库造币和赎回的NFT收取费用。V2 中有三个费用选项，并为所有 DAO 和新的保管库创建设置为以下默认值\n\n1\\. 5% 铸币费\n\n2\\. 0% 随机赎回费\n\n3\\. 5% 目标赎回费\n\n这些费用作为奖励分配给金库的流动性提供者。任何向金库提供流动性的人都可以通过使用 **zap** 自动生成流动性来绕过minting fees（铸造费用）。\n\n### 行业分析\n\n**行业概况**\n\nNFT作为非同质化代币，其定价一直是一个难点。通过剖析NFT的价值构成要素，能够帮助我们分辨不同NFT价格发现机制的偏重点；以及不同的NFT流动性协议，是如何通过影响这些要素，从而干预价格、发现价格甚至获取定价权的。\n\n> **NFT 的功能价值=实用性+所有权历史+数字稀缺性+供求关系+未来价值+流动性溢价**\n\n（1）实用性\n\nNFT 的实用性价值取决于如何使用 NFT，它能够带来哪些效用；以及在不同应用/生态中使用 NFT 的能力（尽管互操作性的实现还不充分）。另一个增加 NFT 实用性价值的方法是与其他企业建立伙伴关系，为 NFT 持有者提供福利。\n\n（2）所有权历史\n\n所有权历史的价值取决于 NFT 发行人和以前所有者的身份。拥有历史价值高的 NFT 往往由知名艺术家或拥有强大品牌的公司创建或发行（IP和权威背书、社会资本）。\n\n（3）数字稀缺性——只适用于顶流\n\n稀缺性是收藏品品牌创造价值的倍增器。稀缺性有三个子标准：绝对稀缺性、相对稀缺性和可用性。稀缺是供求关系的一种特殊情况。实用性NFT的供求关系是最容易调节的。\n\n（4）未来价值\n\n在非同质化代币供应和投机行为驱动下，NFT 的价格走势逐渐变得以金融投资预期为导向。\n\n（5）流动性溢价\n\n流动性溢价 (Liquidity premium)是指将一项投资性资产转化成现金所需要的时间和成本。在较短的时间以接近市价的价格将资产转换成现金则称该资产有较高的流动性。鼓励用户增加交易频率，提高 NFT 的流动性，防止资产因为闲置时间太长而贬值。如游戏可以设计机制，促使玩家交换资产以保持在游戏中的竞争力，\n\n**NFT的价格发现机制**\n\n**1**、销售机制 \n\n**2**、拍卖机制 \n\n**3**、碎片化机制  ——流动性溢价\n\n**其他价格发现机制**\n\n**1**、价格计算 （根据历史数据及相关因子）\n\n**2**、专家网络/同行预测预言机 upshot (根据专家估价加权平均)\n\n**3**、衍生品的隐含定价 （以未来的现金流和估值逆推艺术品的价格）\n\n**风险点：**只有类似 CryptoPunks，在大多数 NFT 收藏者眼里存在共识的 NFT 收藏品能够长期保值。市场上大多数 NFT 收藏品项目无法建立起共识，在市场遭遇打击时会很快变得一文不值。\n\nUnicly这个协议的成功，我是这么理解的：通过捆绑碎片化、拍卖和投票一系列动作，影响了以上要素，形成了**positive feedback loops.**\n\n### 行业周期\n\n随着NFT的金融化，NFT的估值和定价机制非常重要。例如，paradigm的地板价永续合约也建立在nft指数的基础上。他们提出了【地板价】的概念，即市场愿意为从某项目中获得nft所支付的最高价格，在不提前知道将获得哪个NFT的前提下。**NFTX 的目标是为 NFT 建立可靠的，使其在以太坊上的DeFi中得到更广泛的应用。**\n\n### 竞争分析\n\n有两种方法可以将 NFT 碎片化：捆绑法/集合法；价格底线与指数化\n\n**1、捆绑法/集合法（ Unicly 和 NIFTEX ）**\n\n**优点：**\n\n• 支持单个 NFT / 一组的碎片化\n\n• 小投资者能够接触到多样化的高价位 NFTs\n\n• 代币持有人可以拥有对原始资产的**治理权**，使得有效用的 NFTs 价值最大化，比如创收型 NFTs （游戏地块）\n\n**缺点：**\n\n• 很难赎回原始 NFT。几乎没有办法赎回单个 NFT，需要买断整个捆绑资产以释放相关资产\n\n• 没有价格底线可以参考。每一个 NFTs 都必须被单独估值，才能得出整个捆绑资产的估值\n\n**2、指数化（NFTX 和 NFT20 使用）**\n\n**优点：**\n\n• 通过多市场套利为 NFT系列资产创建了较为稳固的价格底线\n\n• 易于赎回原始一整个NFT资产\n\n**缺点：**\n\n• 每个D1基金只接受相同系列的 NFT\n\n• 在一定程度上，模糊了 NFT的价值差，导致每个池子最后留下这一系列中最便宜的NFT\n\n**捆绑法/集合法（ Unicly ）**\n\n捆绑法指的是创建接受不同 NFT 的基金，然后将该基金代币化，用户可以购买基金代币来接触原始 NFT集合 。本质上仍是通过【市场拍卖机制】进行NFT的价格发现。\n\n如unicly：“打包再拆分”，生成一揽子nft的所有权和治理代 币。让nft拥有了更多的流动性曝光和生态场景，且裹挟了更多的参与者，让 uToken 持有者有动力推广该收藏，使 NFT 有机会获得更高出价。这一机制的特征，使得 unicly方法适合炒作价值高、价格比较高的资产；该机制适合需要更多人参与和推广，比如高价值艺术品。\n\n事实也证明了这一点，通过观察这几个项目的 TVL（总锁定价值），我们可以得出一个很肯定的结论，捆绑法已经成功地吸引了更高的管理资产（AUM）。且 Unicly 仅上线3个月，其TVL 是最高的。Unicly 成功的一个原因是由其流动挖矿项目推动的，第二个个原因则是 uJENNY 的创建，这是第一个建立在 Unicly 上的去中心化自治组织（DAO）。uJenny 凭一己之力地贡献了 Unicly 近 40% 的 TVL。Jenny DAO 的目标是获得有价值的 NFT，从这个意义上来看，它类似于一个 NFT 收藏组合的指数基金。\n\n**指数法（NFTX）**\n\nNFTX D1：“同类池平均价”方法，弱化非同质代币之间的市场价格差值，从而增强流动性。这一类是通过【跨市场套利机制】进行价格发现，当流动性足够好可以获得定价权。\n\nNFTX适合一系列中稀缺度相近，但具有较大数量基础和价值共识的资产。对NFT进行分层，消减相近稀缺度相近的NFT对价格差，建构每一类型的平均价。机制适合价格相差不大、需要保证完整性的资产。比如游戏道具、头像等。\n\nNFTX D2:将不同系列的vtoken进行组合出售，设置为NFT指数基金，是基于地板价的整个系列的价格指示标，适合那些不愿意投资单独nft的投资者。\n\n**总结：不同类型的NFT适合不同类型的流动性协议。**例如**，**对于炒作价值高的NFT（顶尖数字收藏品）适合用Unicly，可以看做是一个NFT指数基金。而对于价格相近，具有较大应用基础，需要保证交易前后完整性的NFT资产，适合用NFTX进行交易，比如游戏道具等。",

NFTs have arisen as a consequence of the technological development of mankind and involve questions about the present, the future and in that sense many of the answers are in the past, going back in history.\n\nEven for those who already have to a greater or lesser extent some understanding of the term, it is likely that they will be faced with the difficult task of trying to explain in simple words something that we will see if it becomes a complex phenomenon with the ability to impact every area of human experience.\n\n## Why Fungible?\n\n![BTC/ETH](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*6kkAedTUE1Jw0rR4ANqAng.jpeg)\n\nI will focus on summarizing what is a Non Fungible Token — NFT.\n\nFirst of all it is necessary to take into account what “fungible” means, from a monetary point of view, it is the property that money has of, for example, being exchanged 1:1, i.e. $1 dollar for $1 dollar. The same is true of Bitcoin since of the 21 million Bitcoins that exist in total all are equally equivalent to each other.\n\nTherefore, unlike cryptocurrencies, NFTs are Non-Fungible and this implies that each NFT represents a guarantee of unique digital property in the form of an encrypted token that is registered in the blockchain.

{"id": "0EYUfdkuTMRrVfH4c28HDjT-sKfXCiNtznyHtGY2TVA", "title": "Why Wallets Excite Me Again", "body": "My first stab at an Ethereum wallet was in 2014. I collaborated with [Gavin Wood](https://twitter.com/gavofyork) and [Alex Van Der Sande](https://twitter.com/avsa) to imagine what a dapp browser, dapp store, network monitor, and wallet might look like.\n\n![https://dribbble.com/shots/2175361-Ethereum-App-Store](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5DKrLigAQeGKG8yg9BFEv.webp?height=600&width=800)\n\nIn 2017 I pivoted my little company, Balance, from fintech back to Ethereum when I watched $ETH increased 1000x in value. We focused on the wallet problem again and made huge progress.\n\nBalance pushed out beautiful web interfaces, the WalletConnect standard, a proof-of-concept mobile app, and lots of new design patterns to the Ethereum community.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Balance_io/status/1446518755496919042](https://twitter.com/Balance_io/status/1446518755496919042)\n\nAlmost 8 years later, I am still thinking about wallets—why?\n\n### iOS Safari Extensions\n\nThis summer Apple announced something that totally changed the game for the mobile web: an open API for extending mobile Safari. The mobile web for iOS users is dominated by the default Safari browser that ships with every version of Apple’s mobile operating system.\n\n![https://www.statista.com/statistics/272664/market-share-held-by-mobile-browsers-in-the-us/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y_ucAY60odgLFOnmlAfl5.png?height=898&width=1438)\n\nI had not realised how big of a deal this would be until I tried the 1Password Extension on iOS 15 inside Safari on my iPhone. 1Password went from being a sideshow app that I needed to bounce into to a system that was interwoven with the websites I was using.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ricburton/status/1442799302955319297](https://twitter.com/ricburton/status/1442799302955319297)\n\nThe password entry API Apple created a few years ago was a reasonable solution but it was always fairly restrictive. The Safari Extensions API allowed the 1Password team to fully express themselves and ship something magical.\n\n[https://twitter.com/faraaznishtar/status/1402322626052182018](https://twitter.com/faraaznishtar/status/1402322626052182018)\n\nIt instantly became clear to me that someone was going to build an Ethereum wallet that takes advantage of this new system. Of course, my brilliant friend Faraaz had figured it out the minute the API was announced months before.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ricburton/status/1443693612110254080](https://twitter.com/ricburton/status/1443693612110254080)\n\nI started mocking up a prototype and shared it on Twitter. The response from the community was absolutely fantastic. We got a bunch of people into a Quill Chat and started hacking away.\n\nWithin 2 weeks, [Dimitar Nestorov](https://twitter.com/dimitarnestorov) had hacked together a working prototype by forking MetaMask and putting it inside an Extension.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ricburton/status/1447445762153975820](https://twitter.com/ricburton/status/1447445762153975820)\n\nThis totally de-risked the project. We know it can be done and now we need to do it well. That will take more time and resources which I am happy to invest.\n\nMetaMask launched in 2016 as a Chrome Extension. It linked Ethereum to the desktop web through the browser. It changed everything.\n\n5 years on, I believe wallets that launch with Safari Extensions will have the same impact. Ethereum is coming to the mobile web. We are going to weave together the phone and the protocol seamlessly.\n\n### Premium Ethereum \n\n[https://twitter.com/joogz6/status/1385243304824954881](https://twitter.com/joogz6/status/1385243304824954881)\n\nGas costs are too high for regular people. There are lots of efforts to fix it from many amazing teams. They have delivered  blazing fast systems with lots of security, speed, and cost trade-offs. Wallets have not kept up. It is almost impossible to use Ethereum Layer 2’s and sidechains on your iPhone. We need to fix this *ASAP*. We need to interact with multiple protocols with ease.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ricburton/status/1448829539946094595](https://twitter.com/ricburton/status/1448829539946094595)\n\n### Multi-Protocol Products Need Multi-Protocol Wallets\n\nI recently visited Launch House in LA and had the pleasure of meeting one of the founders of [Internet Camera](https://internet.camera/). He was using IPFS for storage (Arweave soon!), Ethereum Name Service for identity, and Polygon for smaller interactions. He is blending together multiple protocols to make a great product—it is amazing!\n\n[https://twitter.com/InternetCamera/status/1401559706364047362](https://twitter.com/InternetCamera/status/1401559706364047362)\n\nToday, wallets need to *switch* between networks. You have to manually add the details of the network and then opt into each one every single time. It is ridiculous. We need wallets that smoothly communicate with every Ethereum-secured and EVM-based protocol. You should be able to get the job done and the wallet can figure out the complexities on the backend. Just like you do when you interact with top quality web applications today.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ricburton/status/1447386023206346752](https://twitter.com/ricburton/status/1447386023206346752)\n\nDesigning for the merge, a sharded base layer, optimistic roll-ups, side chains, zero knowledge systems, and all kinds of new protocol upgrades is going to be a monumental task. It cannot be done by a single company. It will have to be done by a community.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Balance_io/status/1451217039213793286](https://twitter.com/Balance_io/status/1451217039213793286)\n\n### Open Source Ethereum Wallets\n\nEthereum is an open source project to its core. Today, there is not a canonical open source client for iOS written in native code (Swift / Objective-C) for interacting with Ethereum with a normal wallet setup:\n\n* **Gnosis Safe** has an amazing multi-sig system but it is not designed to create simple seed phrase wallets.\n* **Trust Wallet** has become more focused on supporting the acquiring company, Binance, and all its priorities.\n* **Metamask** and **Rainbow** are written in React Native.\n* Argent and Coinbase Wallet are closed source.\n* Zapper and Zerion will probably be closed source.\n\nAll of these teams have made a set of trade-offs based on their biases and incentives. I respect nearly all of them. Shipping secure wallets is *really* damn hard.\n\nHowever, I still find myself wanting to tinker with a wallet tool that is truly open source and native to iOS. I want to explore and play. I cannot do that today and neither can curious developers.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ricburton/status/1442772031846580225](https://twitter.com/ricburton/status/1442772031846580225)\n\n**Want to join us?**\n\n![Quill is magical](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_GRx_v-ELtpn7SmlArzYY.png?height=600&width=1222)\n\nYou can join us on Quill, a beautiful chat app from a Stripe alumnus.

{"id": "E8FIo5SjvG7DgAYXH1k4kM83piJ5Ys_Hs_dLGCbK_ko", "title": "Solv Protocol ：金融NFT的底层标准创新", "body": "### 背景知识：NFT底层协议标准说明\n\n**与ERC20协议相似的，NFT有三种底层协议标准——ERC-721，ERC-1155，ERC-998。**\n\n**1、ERC-20**：即FT；其主要优势在于可计算，但是缺乏描述能力，如果想要描述100类token，必须要编写100个不同的ERC20合约，发布100种不同的ERC20 tokens。每个token仅有数量属性。\n\n**2、ERC-721：每个NFT都是独一无二、没有同类、不可拆分。——不可计算**\n\n描述能力强，可以通过创建一个ERC721合约，然后铸造100个不同的NFT，每个NFT/token都有一个Token ID。案例：加密猫\n\n**3、ERC-1155：**\n\n描述能力强，可以通过创建一个ERC1155合约，然后铸造100个不同的Token ID，每个ID都是一个类别，\\*\\*一个类别中的token没有任何区别，有数量属性。\\*\\*这里的ID和ERC721对比来看的区别是：ID不再是某个物品，**而是一个类别。**\n\n案例：游戏中的一类道具：ERC1155可以满足不同场景下的灵活需求，比如同时转账多数量的多类别资产，也可以转账多数量的同一类别资产，大大提高了转账的快捷方便程度。\n\n**4、ERC-998：可组合非同质化代币（Composable NFTs,缩写为CNFT）。它的结构设计是一个标准化延伸**可以让任何一个NFT可以拥有其他NFT或FT。\\*\\*转移CNFT时，就是转移CNFT所拥有的整个层级结构和所属关系。\\*\\*简单来说就是ERC-998可以包含多个ERC-721和ERC-20形式的代币。具体方式是通过父tokenID映射到子token合约地址，当子token是NFT/FT时，子合约地址映射到对应的子tokenID/余额。\n\n**5、可拆分NFT（Fractional NFT**）——不在资产底层协议标准层面\n\n**有另外一种分割NFT的方法，即对于不可分割的NFT，对其所有权进行分割**；**Fractional 协议** 使 **NFT** 所有者能够对自己的作品进行所有权分割，分割后的代币可以作为正常的 **ERC-20** 进行使用，从而实现百分比买卖。\n\n**6、为NFT-721增加“数量”属性的vNFT、通过 SLOT机制为token ID进行分类**\n\n![vNFT在整个token协议分类中的位置](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/efMQC_U-aLx35SrpfA8nQ.png?height=738&width=1080)\n\n![vNFT的数据结构](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hMRVib_BqUSPbeQVDTRbM.jpg?height=599&width=2079)\n\n**vNFT——兼容ERC-721**\n\n1、数量   2、SLOT作为NFT的抽象和归类机制  3、定义了 ERC-721 的扩展，与ERC-721兼容，支持灵活的拆分。\n\n一个SLOT代表一个类别，圈定了一组特定的属性，如果任何两个vNFT，都具有这一组属性，且这一组属性都一模一样，那就可以被归为这个SLOT所代表的类别中。被归为一类的vNFT就可以进行数量的加减。\n\n本项目的vNFT 标准已提交EIP-3525，并已于2021/10/20被以太坊正式收录：<https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/3641>\n\n### 业务模型\n\n**什么是Vouchers？**\n\nSolv Vouchers 是 Voucher 的铸造、管理和交易的 DeFi 平台，为项目方提供更便捷、灵活、低成本的锁仓 Token 管理工具。Voucher是一种装有锁仓Token的NFT，可根据预先设定的模式自动释放Token。可以简单理解为SAFT协议的NFT化。\n\n**为什么要铸造Vouchers？**\n\n大部分项目选择将Vesting Tokens直接存入自己编写的智能合约中，这种模式让锁仓额度彻底被“锁死”。Solv Vouchers 帮助项目方灵活的编程NFT，用来代表锁仓额度，从而让锁仓额度的流动性被彻底释放。\n\n**Vouchers具体可以用来做什么？**\n\n**1、额度管理：大幅下降锁仓额度的管理成本**\n\n当项目将锁仓 Token 份额分发给投资人与用户时，需要付出不菲的管理成本，包括 SAFT 协议的签署、按规定承兑 Token，协助持有者转移所有权等。\n\n项目方可以将应该锁仓的 Token 存入智能合约，设置好相应的锁仓期限和解锁方式，便可铸造出代表着该项目锁仓额度的 Voucher。\n\nVoucher 将严格按照铸造时所设定的模式自动释放 Token，为项目方免去了复杂的 SAFT 协议签署以及相关智能合约开发与部署等额外成本。\n\n**Solv Vouchers 支持多种 Token 锁仓方式与操作**\n\nSolv Vouchers 支持线性、单点、阶段、预言机驱动等多种锁仓方式，以及灵活的锁仓时间设定。在释放过程中，Voucher 持有人还可以进行提取、转让、拆分、合并等操作。\n\n对项目方来说，通过铸造 Voucher 来管理额度，是一种更便捷、灵活且低成本的方式。Solv Vouchers 让管理成千上万个额度持有者成为可能。\n\n**2、额度交易：让额度的流转交易更高效——Solv Vouchers Marketplace和支持ERC-721的NFT交易平台**\n\n锁仓Token的交易往往发生在OTC市场，一个充满欺诈、不透明、低效率的市场。这让额度的流动变得尤其困难。通过将锁仓额度通证化，我们将构建一个高透明、低欺诈、无交易对手方风险的链上额度交易市场，让额度持有者以更高效的方式获得流动性。\n\n**Solv Vouchers Marketplace支持全新的碎片化购买**\n\n因vNFT标准下的Voucher本身支持灵活的拆分功能，因此人们可以在内置交易平台 Solv Vouchers Marketplace 进行碎片化购买，即一次性仅购买一部分锁仓 Token。大幅度降低锁仓额度交易的摩擦，促使交易的发生。\n\nVoucher 采用的通证标准 vNFT 与ERC-721兼容，因此 Voucher 可以被所有支持 ERC-721 的交易平台天然支持，比如 **Opensea** 支持 Voucher 的多种交易模式，并支持查询链上 Voucher。\n\n**3、Voucher 借贷：通过借贷释放Voucher流动性**\n\n在传统股权市场中，股票质押是股东获取流动性的一个重要方式，DeFi项目的核心成员往往都具有大量锁仓Token。借贷服务将为锁仓Token持有者提供全新的流动性来源。\n\n相比艺术品或收藏品类 NFT，Voucher 是一种更偏向金融场景的NFT资产，在清算、评估价格等方面更适配借贷金融服务。NFTfi等支持ERC721借贷的协议将天然支持Voucher，同时Aave等借贷领先者也已进入这一领域。\n\n**4、 Repo回购市场**\n\n通过将正在流通的 Token 铸造为 Voucher，项目方可以用再回购协议的形式建立流动性管理机制，以一种更为灵活和有效的方式来管理 Token 流通量价格。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oa4NTlMbABg2DLrcKQ7EZ.png?height=379&width=1745)\n\n### 经济模型\n\n较为均衡，且解锁日均在IDO 60天后。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LzkcM0KgyjPv1rNeWXGyM.png?height=1072&width=2170)\n\n\\*TGE：是指$SOLV的 IDO日期。\n\n\\*\\*Cliff days：从IDO日算起，60天后开始进行释放。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oY_3oY0z403DurTAZ0oAh.png?height=1098&width=2270)\n\n### 收入来源\n\nSolv Marketplace的手续费收入；\n\n持有solv拥有打新资格，以及相关生态治理权（在设计中）\n\n### 特色与优势\n\n1、项目提出了新的NFT标准3525，这个标准是一个适合Financial NFT的token标准，它与ERC-721兼容，并同时支持灵活的拆分。此标准目前已提交EIP，<https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/3641>\n\n2、基于这一技术基础，力图打造DeFi NFT的基础设施、生产工厂和交易市场。全面优化过去的匀质、缺乏个性化、较为粗放的DeFi产品生态。事实证明：Uniswap v3的成功，预示着DeFi会进一步向以vNFT为特点的非匀质资产方向转型。\n\n3、额度发行、管理与交易平台 Solv Vouchers 是 Solv 团队基于 VNFT 开发的第一个 DeFi 应用。其中Allocation market是solv vouchers下的第一个市场，之后会有一个和份额市场平级的回购市场。目前Allocation market已与 DODO、Parsiq、Bounce、NAOS Finance、Ankr、Saffron Finance、Impossible Finance

{"id": "UB3N2aALy5Pwlt49XR2hxdzEd6rSOaE88-RA6v4ynO4", "title": "What is a NFT?", "body": "![Digital Evolution](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*FmA1ow4X7rVeCS9lBNhe_w.jpeg)\n\nThis is a question that many people are asking at the moment and the interest is just going to increase trough time. NFTs have arisen as a consequence of the technological development of mankind and involve questions about the present, the future and in that sense many of the answers are in the past, going back in history.\n\nEven for those who already have to a greater or lesser extent some understanding of the term, it is likely that they will be faced with the difficult task of trying to explain in simple words something that we will see if it becomes a complex phenomenon with the ability to impact every area of human experience.\n\n## Why Fungible?\n\n![BTC/ETH](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*6kkAedTUE1Jw0rR4ANqAng.jpeg)\n\nI will focus on summarizing what is a Non Fungible Token — NFT.\n\nFirst of all it is necessary to take into account what “fungible” means, from a monetary point of view, it is the property that money has of, for example, being exchanged 1:1, i.e. $1 dollar for $1 dollar. The same is true of Bitcoin since of the 21 million Bitcoins that exist in total all are equally equivalent to each other.\n\nTherefore, unlike cryptocurrencies, NFTs are Non-Fungible and this implies that each NFT represents a guarantee of unique digital property in the form of an encrypted token that is registered in the blockchain. What this means is that every tokenized asset or NFT is subject to a unique owner, associated to a personal wallet, which can be verified on the blockchain of the network [(Ethereum)](https://ethereum.org/en/) where the asset is hosted, secured by a digital contract.\n\n## Verification of Authenticity and Certificate of Ownership\n\n![Profesor Elon Rocket Factory (PERF) NFT #1373](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*y8druaUabydy2j0VrmayJw.jpeg)\n\nThis means that any existing asset in the physical world can now be tracked in a digital public record, for example: from real estate, artwork, artists merchandise, [music albums](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/arts/music/wu-tang-clan-once-upon-a-time-in-shaolin.html), donations. Everything that involves a transaction or exchange of either a good or a service can be verified by the network.\n\nFrom the cultural aspect related to the arts or music, it represents the possibility of defeating the piracy of content, it also gives the possibility of verifying the authenticity of the creative work of any person as well as safeguarding their intellectual property.\n\nIn addition to the above, this also allows artists to manage their work independently without the need of third parties who are in charge of validating the artists as relevant or not, i.e. the big galleries and museums or the music companies that hold the monopoly of the content.\n\n## NFT, Community and Decentralization\n\n![Networking Communities](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*jCxJcrR2-GPuw-m9eybnAQ.jpeg)\n\nThe innovation lies in the possibility of verifying and certifying assets of human creation such as art, music or real estate and any exchange that occurs as a result of the interaction between two people, this implies a direct change in the way in which value is exchanged for creative activities and for everything that is useful to society.\n\nOn the other hand, NFTs also have the quality of functioning as an entry key or a way to identify each individual as a member of a community, which opens endless possibilities for the way in which present and future humans can organize themselves into groups and interact with each other.\n\nPerhaps this will allow for new ways of governance where each individual can be verified and identified within each community through a digital token as an active member of that community. This can be translated into new voting systems and therefore greater decentralization since each NFT within an ecosystem could be equivalent to a vote within a [decentralized organization](https://101blockchains.com/define-dao-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/).\n\n## Mainstream NFTs\n\n![Reese Witherspoon Tweet about buying her first NFT](https://miro.medium.com/max/1216/1\\*tGTHCW12wwQ9dM5bsvV3LA.png)\n\nAlthough it is something new today in (Q4) 2021 it is a phenomenon that as a good product of technological development and the digital era, it is deploying fast and its massive adoption seems that compared to previous technologies and innovations will be so fast that people will make use of them without even realizing it.\n\nWhen artists and athletes like [Sharika](https://www.instagram.com/p/CULLYI4ML9C/), [Maluma](https://ethernitychain.medium.com/ethernity-chain-presents-icon-x-maluma-e8c94e4e9692), [Messi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSpTr6Yplqs&ab_channel=EthernityChain), [Shaquille O’Neal](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/04/shaq-to-release-nft-collection/) or [Ressee Witherspoon](https://twitter.com/ReeseW/status/1447608205224316931) with millions of followers join the fever for NFTs it may be an indication that something is happening.\n\n## The Future Now\n\n![The Future is Now](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*dPIRMG1PE6i79CpRN41CDw.jpeg)\n\nThe future is happening before our eyes, we live in a world where everything happens very fast, information flies and many times we are saturated with information. However, nothing stands still, progress and technological development is increasingly accelerated.\n\nBecause of its innovative nature, it is an environment where all actors are learning on the fly and everything happens at an accelerated speed.\n\n## Developing Technology\n\nA developing technology that influences diverse communities and not just in the art or sports industry, but technology, gaming, social networking, design, music and almost any aspect of human life.\n\nSo join me in following what is happening in this space that is just beginning and can be built together.\n\n## Note: This article is not intended to serve as financial advice.

Actually, the study showed that people underestimate another person's willingness to help by as much as 100% (i.e. people are twice as likely to help than you think).\n\nWhy am I telling you all of this?\n\nBecause the online world is chock-full of opportunity — if you're willing and able to look for and ask for it. [Research projections indicate the global e-learning industry will grow to $37 billion by 2026](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1232427/global-corporate-e-learning-market-size/#:\\~:text=The%20market%20size%20of%20the,billion%20U.S.%20dollars%20by%202026.) — a reflection of 11% year-over-year growth starting in 2019. What's \"e-learning\" it's the industry of teaching others your knowledge via digital means. With just a few tools and the adoption and implementation of a few strategies, you can create and scale your own digital e-learning side hustle.\n\nThe opportunity isn't just limited to the above method. There are more unique online side hustle opportunities you can adopt to help build your online business and finally quit your soul-sucking nine-to-five.\n\nThese are online side hustle opportunities most people are too proud to appreciate.\n\n> \"If you do what you have always done, you will get what you always have gotten.\"\n>\n> — Tony Robbins\n\n# Millions of people are already looking and asking for your work\n\nWriting and producing on online platforms is and already has radically changed the way we consume content.\n\nUnless you've been living under a rock, you probably know about this opportunity.\n\nWhy then do you only *consume* the content and not *produce* your own?\n\nThat's the pivotal question…\n\nFor many, the claim they have — only, they haven't had any breakthrough content (i.e. viral content). *Touché*. Only, viral content isn't produced like it was 10 years ago (thanks Justin Beiber). Content platforms are changing their requirements to how an individual can actualize monetization:\n\n* Among other requirements, [you must have at least 4,000 hours of accumulated watch time ](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72851?hl=en)within 12 months to monetize via YouTube.\n* [Medium changed their requirements starting in 2022](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/medium-revamps-its-partner-program-launching-new-eligibility-requirements-and-referral-bonuses/) to having a follower count and a minimum number of published work to be partnership-eligible.\n* [Quora just released ](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/creators-can-now-monetize-their-expertise-on-quora/)*[Quora+](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/creators-can-now-monetize-their-expertise-on-quora/)*[ to compete in the online content platform](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/creators-can-now-monetize-their-expertise-on-quora/) space and has its own minimum requirements.\n\nWhat does all of this mean for you, the creator?\n\nIt means two things: one, content platforms are furthering their legitimacy in the online space; and two, they are legitimizing their content creators by placing minimum requirements. In other words, they're trying to get rid of the \"flash in the pan\" overnight sensation.\n\nBut as a creator — you should be focused on the long game anyway. When you can let go of your cynicism and just write, you will be surprised where you end up a year or two later.\n\n# Traditional newspaper is dead — this is your new opportunity\n\nI had an hour and a half conversation with a fellow online content creator that many of you reading this are familiar with. She has been writing for a number of years now and has developed and grown a substantial following.\n\nWe held our Zoom conversation because she was having some issues with selling her new info product (we'll get to that in a later section). Being the absolute info product wizard that I am (not to mention self-absorbed), I was happy to oblige and open my vault. Her issue was twofold:\n\n1. She was looking for a way to integrate *evergreen* scarcity funnels. This means she can automatically fire off product sales campaigns (even while sleeping).\n2. She was curious as to how often she should send emails to her list.\n\nThe second point there got my wheels spinning. She informed me that she boasts a 50% open rate and a 10% click rate with her newsletter. Compare [that to the industry average of 20%](https://mailchimp.com/resources/email-marketing-benchmarks/) and [2.5% respectively](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/what-are-the-average-click-and-read-rates-for-email-campaigns/).\n\nHere's why I found this interesting and how I am connecting this to an individual's cynicism. She told me she barely sends newsletters (maybe once a month).\n\n**Here's the rub:** Generally speaking if you're adding email subscribers to your list, they want to hear from you!\n\nWhat's more? A considerable percentage will pay for knowledge if you can market it to your list.\n\nHowever, most are too cynical to think people will pay, and most people believe they have nothing of value to offer.\n\nI promise you — if you start writing via section number one (content platforms), you'll begin to uncover your knowledge, gifts, and wisdom that you can package to an audience.\n\nToss your cynicism aside and ask your audience to pay for certain information.\n\n# Your mind: neatly packed, wrapped, and shipped\n\nMost online content creators and entrepreneurs will probably talk up and promote the selling of online courses until they're blue in the face.\n\nPut me in among that group.\n\nHowever, I don't want to talk about that with you today. I want to talk about something that is easier to create and implement. You could probably even complete it all in a weekend (if you're willing to put in the handful of hours).\n\nI'm talking about creating, uploading, and marketing an ebook.\n\nLet's keep the assumption that you've: thrown away your cynicism, you've started content writing, you've started building an email list, you've started asking that email list for money.\n\nNow, you can take all of that and ask them what obstacles they're dealing with. This will help you develop your MVP (minimum viable product). That would be a solution to the admitted problem. What's awesome here is most people are cynical and believe you need to hire an expensive freelance designer to make your ebook. In fact, you don't. I recommend first, finding a free cover to use on Canva (see image 3.1):\n\n(Image 3.1) Courtesy: Author\n\nAfter that, you would want to just outline it on GoogleSlides and downloading it as a PDF (see image 3.2)\n\n(Image 3.2) Courtesy: Author\n\nThe content of this is from a freelance client I was working with. All I did was paste in the document I created for the business and did all the formatting and design myself.\n\nIf we can put our cynicism aside we can draw inspiration from Best-Selling author, Jeff Goins. Before Goins was a famous writer, he was a side hustler while working a full-time job as a marketer. [After modestly growing his list, Goins created an ebook](https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-goins-entrepreneur-advice-2015-3) similar to the way I just described, and it helped start his writing business,\n\n> \"And with that first eBook, I made $1,500 in a weekend. At the time, that was about half a month’s salary for me. An entire paycheck in two days. I couldn’t believe it.\"\n>\n> — Jeff Goins\n\nThis can be yours as well — if you can put your pride and doubt at bay.\n\n# Befriend the 21st Century talk-show-hosts\n\nCreating a [podcast takes a lot of work](https://open.spotify.com/show/4dkQjbhD1y4QrdKv4LbWPQ?si=22f2c62144204767) (just ask\n\n[Amardeep Parmar](https://medium.com/u/ff086d17b40f?source=post_page-----7df35be8b539--------------------------------)\n\n). If you're like him and you work your ass off, you can create something amazing like he has.\n\nIf you want to do less work and still reap *some* reward — you can go another route. You can go on a podcast guest campaign.\n\nDon't believe me?\n\nI'm going to do a quick Google search for \"become a podcast guest.\" This is the first result (see image 4.1):\n\n(Image 4.1) Courtesy: Author & [pitchpodcasts.com](https://pitchpodcasts.com/)\n\nThis site has over 400 podcasts actively looking for podcast guests. Don't get it twisted — this is just one of many sites looking for podcasts guests. The real number is probably in the thousands.\n\nSo what's the side hustle strategy here?\n\nYou secure a spot on the podcast, you'll go through the questioning and the conversation. Now, it's important that you mention your expertise and any of the products you have that would help the podcast host's audience. Every chance you get to talk about your side hustle — you do it.\n\nAlso, you know how a podcast always ends with,\n\n> *\"Where can our listeners hear more from you/find you?\"*\n\nYou can create a special URL strictly for that episode. Say something like,\n\n> *\"The audience can find me at **\\[www.yourbusiness.com/nameofpodcast\\]** where they can get free resources and more information about everything we talked about!\"*\n\nCourtesy: Author\n\nNow that URL is a landing page to have listeners opt in to your list where you can send them to purchase the ebook and become premium, paying members!\n\nOf course, you have to believe that even though some podcasts might reject your guest pitch, others will gladly have you on!\n\n# Bonus: The work begins to sell itself\n\nFreelance work will help make your ends meet.\n\nWhy do I have this as a \"bonus\"?\n\nBecause I can only speak through my own experience with this one, and that experience dictates that I've never *actively* looked for freelance writing work. I've had all my work come to me either through word-of-mouth (through my own network) or through getting pitched by businesses via email.\n\nWhile you can go out and hustle your way to getting a secured freelance client, I've included this as a bonus because if you can manage the building of the four aforementioned side hustles — it's very possible this can come to you as a bonus reward.\n\n> \"I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it.\"\n>\n> — Thomas Jefferson\n\n# How to quit your job and chase your dream: what it really takes\n\nIt takes a lot — let's be honest.\n\nI'm going to give you the good news first (because hopefully the bad news will leave a sour enough taste in your mouth to take action).\n\n**The good news:** Building a profitable and scalable side hustle that can evolve into a full-time, entrepreneurial endeavor is possible. With the proper strategy and right mindset, it can be achieved.\n\nThat whole \"mindset\" bit offers us an apt segue for the bad news…\n\n**The bad news:** too many people are too full of pride and cynicism to even give this whole \"game\" a fair shake. Too many people quit before they even start and then point their finger back at the world with blame and shout, \"woe is me.\"\n\nPlease don't let the creeping cynicism take you as well.\n\nWe need your gifts now, more than ever.\n\nWe need your voice and your knowledge.\n\nThere has never been a better and easier time to share those gifts and that knowledge with the world.\n\nSo long as you take a chance and think,\n\n> \"What if?\"\n\nPlease answer that question. For all of us.\n\n## Ready to make more?\n\nIf you want to excel and earn more than what you’re currently making by doing what you love — regardless of your experience — [check out my guide](https://tribeloyal.com/free-6-step-course/).", "timestamp": 1635189511, "digest": "lQJbFLXXQaiDCMx77dcHj-ItxSAp9ZGUNscDSEvHKtk", "contributor": "0xD07d879573eC121cf4fD101C0D4eC7Dd2520F7fB"}
{"id": "2Nsj28P78YUljfahqa1SFfqeCjSkUkI_0kPxJCkB0UI", "title": "100 Things I Learned From Hosting 100 Crypto Podcast Episodes", "body": "One year ago, I learned about Web3 for the first time when [Matt Gould](https://twitter.com/matthewegould) became my newest client at the content marketing agency I was working at. Matt hired us to help him start a podcast for his company, Unstoppable Domains, which we would call [The Unstoppable Podcast](https://the-unstoppable-podcast.simplecast.com/). Today we released [Episode 100](https://the-unstoppable-podcast.simplecast.com/episodes/100-writing-about-and-understanding-crypto-with-jarrod-dicker-of-tcg) of the podcast.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1430040426958909440?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1430040426958909440?s=20)\n\nAs was custom practice with all of my clients, I offered to co-host or moderate the first few episodes with Matt until we were able to get a rolodex of guests lined up. If his goal was to educate normies about crypto, who better to ask him really basic questions about crypto than a normie like myself? Luckily, he agreed.\n\nFor the first few episodes, we talked about basic Web3 topics, like “what is the decentralized web?” and “what is DeFi?”\n\n![Some of the initial episodes on The Unstoppable Podcast](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GkAKrU0cbdDmtXtLNrIMU.png?height=1174&width=1542)\n\nI quickly became hooked and started to spend all of my free time diving deeper into these topics. But while it was all fascinating to me, the one thing that really pulled me down the rabbithole was the idea that creators would be able to own all of their content and data in a decentralized world - something we’ve never been able to experience in our legacy Web2 world. As a former travel blogger who had experienced firsthand the pains of trying to monetize content in Web2, this idea was really enticing to me.\n\nNot long after recording our first few episodes together, Matt asked me to join Unstoppable Domains full time and dedicate all of my time and efforts toward growing the podcast. While it certainly felt risky to dive into an industry I hardly knew anything about, I knew enough at that point to know that Web3 is the future, and I wanted to help build it. Plus, as a former attorney turned travel blogger turned content marketer, I was no stranger to career shifts, so this was all really par for the course.\n\nToday, 10 months after working at Unstoppable Domains full time, I am proud to announce that we have just released Episode 100 of the podcast with none other than Jarrod Dicker, who is one of the most knowledgeable people on how Web3 will change the creator economy - the exact topic that initially pulled me down the crypto rabbithole.\n\n## 100 Things I Learned From Hosting 100 Crypto Podcast Episodes\n\nHere are 100 things I learned from hosting 100 episodes of [The Unstoppable Podcast](https://the-unstoppable-podcast.simplecast.com/):\n\n1\\. Crypto, blockchain, Web3 are the future.\n\n2\\. The crypto community hangs out on Twitter, Discord, and Telegram. Everything else is more or less irrelevant.\n\n3\\. Working in Web3 can be exciting or scary, depending on the day. But mostly exciting.\n\n4\\. Making a career switch to work in Web3 - or any new emerging tech - in the early days is scary.\n\n5\\. You’ll never feel as rewarded as when you make a scary decision and it changes your life for the better.\n\n6\\. One of the best ways to learn a new industry super fast is to start a podcast.\n\n7\\. Being a good podcast host is less about being good at talking and more about being good at listening.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1450833643753013248?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1450833643753013248?s=20)\n\n8\\. If you listen carefully to what your guest says and have a naturally inquisitive mind, you will ask interesting, thought provoking questions to get your guest to say even more interesting and thought provoking things.\n\n9\\. Asking “why?” in thoughtful settings as an adult is much less annoying than blindly asking “why?” to everything as a child.\n\n10\\. The best way to prepare for an interview is to stalk the guest’s Twitter and listen to any past interviews they’ve recorded.\n\n11\\. Talking about topics the guest is passionate about will produce a better podcast than talking about topics you’re passionate about.\n\n12\\. Always keep an open mind. 99% of things exist in a grey area.\n\n13\\. Spend the majority of your time living in and investigating that grey area.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1430042716109295617?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1430042716109295617?s=20)\n\n14\\. Surround yourself with people more knowledgeable than you.\n\n15\\. But don’t forget to give back when you become the smartest person in the room.\n\n16\\. Few things in crypto are right or wrong, true or false. Most of what you hear from smart people is their opinion/perspective - and you will hear them disagree with each other.\n\n17\\. Speaking of which, it’s ok to disagree.\n\n18\\. Try to think in terms of complementary opposites (h/t [Kernel](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/play-of-pattern)). If something registers in your brain as “good,” ask yourself what the “bad” is that has to exist for you to think something is good.\n\n19\\. Groupthink is a highly contagious disease with the power to kill Web3. Form your own opinions and don’t fall for groupthink.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1446929213718548481?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1446929213718548481?s=20)\n\n20\\. The ability to think critically is an underrated skill.\n\n21\\. So is the ability to think creatively.\n\n22\\. If you are a creative person who also knows how to code, you are an indomitable force.\n\n23\\. The people who truly care about driving Web3 forward are very mission oriented.\n\n24\\. You can approach crypto from a trader perspective or from a builder perspective. I think few people can balance the two well.\n\n25\\. Speculation is a zero sum game.\n\n26\\. Don’t brush people off when they say DYOR. Actually do your own research.\n\n27\\. Start creating content as soon as you start learning about crypto. This is the best way to test your knowledge.\n\n28\\. If you’re worried you don’t know enough about crypto to be writing/tweeting/creating videos about it, just remember that everyone else feels the same way.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1448027238473953281?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1448027238473953281?s=20)\n\n29\\. The more you know, the less you’ll feel like you know.\n\n30\\. Also remember that people like following a good growth journey. You can inspire others by showing how much you’ve learned in a short time.\n\n31\\. If you’re struggling to put out content because of perfectionism, create the worst content you can for a week straight and then nothing you create will seem bad anymore (h/t [Jonathan Mann](https://the-unstoppable-podcast.simplecast.com/episodes/88-writing-the-first-ever-on-chain-song-with-jonathan-mann-from-the-digitally-rare-podcast)).\n\n32\\. Don’t be afraid to fail. If you live your entire life too afraid to do anything for fear of failure, you’ll never grow.\n\n33\\. Confidence is not directly correlated with # of twitter followers, # of years in crypto, etc.\n\n34\\. You can build confidence through practice.\n\n35\\. Don’t be afraid to experiment.\n\n36\\. Creating content is also a great way to build up your reputation and social graph, which will also help you get a Web3 job if that’s what you’re after.\n\n37\\. The only way to fully understand the language and culture of the country of crypto is to live in it, talk to the locals, and interact in it everyday.\n\n[https://twitter.com/](https://twitter.com/_cooperray_/status/1450846947309412355?s=21)*[cooperray](https://twitter.com/_cooperray_/status/1450846947309412355?s=21)*[/status/1450846947309412355?s=21](https://twitter.com/_cooperray_/status/1450846947309412355?s=21)\n\n38\\. Don’t just learn, but also do. Get a wallet, interact with dapps, make some friends.\n\n39\\. The best way to immerse yourself in the crypto world is by actively engaging on Twitter and Discord.\n\n40\\. Don’t leave more than 3 Discord channels unmuted, and turn off your DMs.\n\n41\\. There is something interesting about Web3 for everyone, no matter what your background is.\n\n42\\. The formula to crypto-pilling someone is to understand where they’re coming from, what their interests are, and tell them about crypto from that angle.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1448739601498075140?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1448739601498075140?s=20)\n\n43\\. The more you learn about crypto, the harder it becomes to explain crypto concepts to newbies.\n\n44\\. Drawing analogies between Web3 and Web2 concepts can be a useful way to help normies understand crypto concepts.\n\n45\\. But ultimately we need to shift our thinking from translating Web2 concepts into Web3 terms to thinking about Web3 concepts through a Web3 native lens.\n\n46\\. To create a holistic crypto education curriculum, we need to decentralize curation of that curriculum.\n\n[https://twitter.com/zach__davidson/status/1450449153373491204?s=20](https://twitter.com/zach__davidson/status/1450449153373491204?s=20)\n\n47\\. Any centralized entity or group with the power to dictate the way everyone lives will fail.\n\n48\\. In an age of increased globalization and decentralization, nation-states may not survive the test of time.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1442522971340296196?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1442522971340296196?s=20)\n\n49\\. Moving forward, we are going to see decreased loyalty to nation-states and increased loyalty to borderless communities.\n\n50\\. Education is a public good. Share your learnings with others.\n\n51\\. Two heads are better than one. Three heads are even better. 10 is even better, 100 is even better…\n\n52\\. We will be able to accomplish so much more when we work together than when we work against each other.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1450204623462010882?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1450204623462010882?s=20)\n\n53\\. Find your tribe - a group of friends you vibe with who are also working on building out Web3.\n\n54\\. Maybe start a multisig with these people, maybe start a DAO.\n\n55\\. Tweeting is a good way to identify people whose mission align with yours and find friends.\n\n56\\. Having internet friends is not weird. In fact, it’s awesome.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ohhshiny/status/1450941276430372865?s=21](https://twitter.com/ohhshiny/status/1450941276430372865?s=21)\n\n57\\. While making friends online is great, you’ll form much deeper connections in person.\n\n58\\. Go to in person conferences, not for the conference but for the side events and people.\n\n59\\. It’s ok to not vibe with everyone.\n\n60\\. A rising tide lifts all boats.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Daryllautk/status/1450124055487651849?s=20](https://twitter.com/Daryllautk/status/1450124055487651849?s=20)\n\n61\\. It can be easy to get so caught up in *what* we’re building that we forget *who* we’re building it for: humans.\n\n62\\. We are all human beings, not faceless pfps on the metaverse.\n\n63\\. Humans are flawed beings with emotions, personal lives, and limitations. Let’s not pretend we’re anything else.\n\n64\\. The only way to prevent Black Mirror IRL from happening is to think holistically about the human experience.\n\n65\\. A new product cannot be successful if it will inevitably harm the lives of some people.\n\n66\\. Our perspective is limited to the sum of our experiences, and the sum of any individual’s experiences is limited.\n\n67\\. The only way we can create a Web3 for all the people is by getting out of our bubbles and exposing ourselves to different perspectives and lived experiences.\n\n68\\. Diversity is a non-negotiable for building Web3. If we want to build a web that will cater to people from all over the world and all backgrounds, we need to involve people from all over the world and all backgrounds.\n\n69\\. Many of our intentions with building Web3 are similar to our intentions with building the original web. If we don’t learn from history, we’ll repeat it.\n\n70\\. Fun fact: NFTs were invented in 1958.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1433179887708344321?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1433179887708344321?s=20)\n\n71\\. We accept many things in life without question for no reason other than that’s how it’s always been.\n\n72\\. If we can learn to question basic principles in life, we can allow ourselves to create a better world.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1444005218698498048?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1444005218698498048?s=20)\n\n73\\. It’s very easy to get burnt out in crypto.\n\n74\\. Intentionally blocking off time away from the screen is good for your mental health.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1444467146512285699?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1444467146512285699?s=20)\n\n75\\. We need to be able to have safe and open conversations about mental health that don’t feel taboo or judged.\n\n76\\. Crypto moves fast, but you won’t be able to move at all without your health.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1442691934355476485?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1442691934355476485?s=20)\n\n77\\. It’s good to have hobbies outside of crypto.\n\n78\\. I recommend finding hobbies that involve getting outside, doing something physical, and interacting with human beings IRL.\n\n79\\. People like having responsibilities (not obligations) because it gives them a sense of ownership.\n\n80\\. Your community will be stronger if you let them have a voice and a vote.\n\n81\\. Community is more important in crypto than in any other industry I’ve been in, perhaps because we’re still in the early days of building.\n\n82\\. We’re still in the early days of crypto.\n\n83\\. Despite how it may look today, crypto is not about helping the rich get richer; it’s about helping those who weren’t able to earn wealth in our legacy system earn wealth in Web3.\n\n84\\. Web3 and DeFi will even out the playing field for all groups of people and finally give disadvantaged communities an opportunity to overcome the systemic bias that has worked against them for generations.\n\n85\\. The only way to eliminate human bias is to take humans out of the equation.\n\n86\\. If a smart contract is coded in a nondiscriminatory fashion, it cannot choose to discriminate at a later date.\n\n87\\. Most people don’t think enough about online privacy.\n\n88\\. Privacy is a fundamental human right, and valuing that right doesn’t mean you have something to hide.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1443342754386366465?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1443342754386366465?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/SecretNetwork/status/1446566598257651718?s=20](https://twitter.com/SecretNetwork/status/1446566598257651718?s=20)\n\n89\\. Being anon online provides that extra layer of privacy - and safety.\n\n90\\. You don’t have to know someone’s legal identity to be able to relate to them.\n\n91\\. Remember that there’s a real human face behind every anon account you interact with.\n\n92\\. Time is a strange thing in crypto, where a year can feel like a decade.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1441017328725118976?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1441017328725118976?s=20)\n\n93\\. Time passes especially fast in a bull run.\n\n94\\. Try not to get burnt out during the bull runs so you are energized to build during the bear markets.\n\n95\\. Focus on the long term vision, not short term gains.\n\n96\\. Right now many people are priced out of becoming crypto native. This is a problem we need to solve.\n\n97\\. We also need to improve wallet UX so that the burden of safely storing your keys doesn’t come with such harsh consequences.\n\n98\\. When DeFi and NFTs and DAOs and social tokens figure out a way to combine forces, that’s when the magic happens.\n\n99\\. It’s only a matter of time until we onboard all 4.6+ billion internet users to Web3.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1435463584146886658?s=20](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1435463584146886658?s=20)\n\n100\\.

While it certainly felt risky to dive into an industry I hardly knew anything about, I knew enough at that point to know that Web3 is the future, and I wanted to help build it. Plus, as a former attorney turned travel blogger turned content marketer, I was no stranger to career shifts, so this was all really par for the course.\n\nToday, 10 months after working at Unstoppable Domains full time, I am proud to announce that we have just released Episode 100 of the podcast with none other than Jarrod Dicker, who is one of the most knowledgeable people on how Web3 will change the creator economy - the exact topic that initially pulled me down the crypto rabbithole.\n\n## 100 Things I Learned From Hosting 100 Crypto Podcast Episodes\n\nHere are 100 things I learned from hosting 100 episodes of [The Unstoppable Podcast](https://the-unstoppable-podcast.simplecast.com/):\n\n1\\. Crypto, blockchain, Web3 are the future.\n\n2\\. The crypto community hangs out on Twitter, Discord, and Telegram. Everything else is more or less irrelevant.\n\n3\\. Working in Web3 can be exciting or scary, depending on the day. But mostly exciting.\n\n4\\. Making a career switch to work in Web3 - or any new emerging tech - in the early days is scary.\n\n5\\. You’ll never feel as rewarded as when you make a scary decision and it changes your life for the better.\n\n6\\. One of the best ways to learn a new industry super fast is to start a podcast.\n\n7\\. Being a good podcast host is less about being good at talking and more about being good at listening.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1450833643753013248?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1450833643753013248?s=20)\n\n8\\. If you listen carefully to what your guest says and have a naturally inquisitive mind, you will ask interesting, thought provoking questions to get your guest to say even more interesting and thought provoking things.\n\n9\\. Asking “why?” in thoughtful settings as an adult is much less annoying than blindly asking “why?” to everything as a child.\n\n10\\. The best way to prepare for an interview is to stalk the guest’s Twitter and listen to any past interviews they’ve recorded.\n\n11\\. Talking about topics the guest is passionate about will produce a better podcast than talking about topics you’re passionate about.\n\n12\\. Always keep an open mind. 99% of things exist in a grey area.\n\n13\\. Spend the majority of your time living in and investigating that grey area.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1430042716109295617?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1430042716109295617?s=20)\n\n14\\. Surround yourself with people more knowledgeable than you.\n\n15\\. But don’t forget to give back when you become the smartest person in the room.\n\n16\\. Few things in crypto are right or wrong, true or false. Most of what you hear from smart people is their opinion/perspective - and you will hear them disagree with each other.\n\n17\\. Speaking of which, it’s ok to disagree.\n\n18\\. Try to think in terms of complementary opposites (h/t [Kernel](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/play-of-pattern)). If something registers in your brain as “good,” ask yourself what the “bad” is that has to exist for you to think something is good.\n\n19\\. Groupthink is a highly contagious disease with the power to kill Web3. Form your own opinions and don’t fall for groupthink.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1446929213718548481?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1446929213718548481?s=20)\n\n20\\. The ability to think critically is an underrated skill.\n\n21\\. So is the ability to think creatively.\n\n22\\. If you are a creative person who also knows how to code, you are an indomitable force.\n\n23\\. The people who truly care about driving Web3 forward are very mission oriented.\n\n24\\. You can approach crypto from a trader perspective or from a builder perspective. I think few people can balance the two well.\n\n25\\. Speculation is a zero sum game.\n\n26\\. Don’t brush people off when they say DYOR. Actually do your own research.\n\n27\\. Start creating content as soon as you start learning about crypto. This is the best way to test your knowledge.\n\n28\\. If you’re worried you don’t know enough about crypto to be writing/tweeting/creating videos about it, just remember that everyone else feels the same way.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1448027238473953281?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1448027238473953281?s=20)\n\n29\\. The more you know, the less you’ll feel like you know.\n\n30\\. Also remember that people like following a good growth journey. You can inspire others by showing how much you’ve learned in a short time.\n\n31\\. If you’re struggling to put out content because of perfectionism, create the worst content you can for a week straight and then nothing you create will seem bad anymore (h/t [Jonathan Mann](https://the-unstoppable-podcast.simplecast.com/episodes/88-writing-the-first-ever-on-chain-song-with-jonathan-mann-from-the-digitally-rare-podcast)).\n\n32\\. Don’t be afraid to fail. If you live your entire life too afraid to do anything for fear of failure, you’ll never grow.\n\n33\\. Confidence is not directly correlated with # of twitter followers, # of years in crypto, etc.\n\n34\\. You can build confidence through practice.\n\n35\\. Don’t be afraid to experiment.\n\n36\\. Creating content is also a great way to build up your reputation and social graph, which will also help you get a Web3 job if that’s what you’re after.\n\n37\\. The only way to fully understand the language and culture of the country of crypto is to live in it, talk to the locals, and interact in it everyday.\n\n[https://twitter.com/](https://twitter.com/_cooperray_/status/1450846947309412355?s=21)*[cooperray](https://twitter.com/_cooperray_/status/1450846947309412355?s=21)*[/status/1450846947309412355?s=21](https://twitter.com/_cooperray_/status/1450846947309412355?s=21)\n\n38\\. Don’t just learn, but also do. Get a wallet, interact with dapps, make some friends.\n\n39\\. The best way to immerse yourself in the crypto world is by actively engaging on Twitter and Discord.\n\n40\\. Don’t leave more than 3 Discord channels unmuted, and turn off your DMs.\n\n41\\. There is something interesting about Web3 for everyone, no matter what your background is.\n\n42\\. The formula to crypto-pilling someone is to understand where they’re coming from, what their interests are, and tell them about crypto from that angle.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1448739601498075140?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1448739601498075140?s=20)\n\n43\\. The more you learn about crypto, the harder it becomes to explain crypto concepts to newbies.\n\n44\\. Drawing analogies between Web3 and Web2 concepts can be a useful way to help normies understand crypto concepts.\n\n45\\. But ultimately we need to shift our thinking from translating Web2 concepts into Web3 terms to thinking about Web3 concepts through a Web3 native lens.\n\n46\\. To create a holistic crypto education curriculum, we need to decentralize curation of that curriculum.\n\n[https://twitter.com/zach__davidson/status/1450449153373491204?s=20](https://twitter.com/zach__davidson/status/1450449153373491204?s=20)\n\n47\\. Any centralized entity or group with the power to dictate the way everyone lives will fail.\n\n48\\. In an age of increased globalization and decentralization, nation-states may not survive the test of time.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1442522971340296196?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1442522971340296196?s=20)\n\n49\\. Moving forward, we are going to see decreased loyalty to nation-states and increased loyalty to borderless communities.\n\n50\\. Education is a public good. Share your learnings with others.\n\n51\\. Two heads are better than one. Three heads are even better. 10 is even better, 100 is even better…\n\n52\\. We will be able to accomplish so much more when we work together than when we work against each other.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1450204623462010882?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1450204623462010882?s=20)\n\n53\\. Find your tribe - a group of friends you vibe with who are also working on building out Web3.\n\n54\\. Maybe start a multisig with these people, maybe start a DAO.\n\n55\\. Tweeting is a good way to identify people whose mission align with yours and find friends.\n\n56\\. Having internet friends is not weird. In fact, it’s awesome.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ohhshiny/status/1450941276430372865?s=21](https://twitter.com/ohhshiny/status/1450941276430372865?s=21)\n\n57\\. While making friends online is great, you’ll form much deeper connections in person.\n\n58\\. Go to in person conferences, not for the conference but for the side events and people.\n\n59\\. It’s ok to not vibe with everyone.\n\n60\\. A rising tide lifts all boats.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Daryllautk/status/1450124055487651849?s=20](https://twitter.com/Daryllautk/status/1450124055487651849?s=20)\n\n61\\. It can be easy to get so caught up in *what* we’re building that we forget *who* we’re building it for: humans.\n\n62\\. We are all human beings, not faceless pfps on the metaverse.\n\n63\\. Humans are flawed beings with emotions, personal lives, and limitations. Let’s not pretend we’re anything else.\n\n64\\. The only way to prevent Black Mirror IRL from happening is to think holistically about the human experience.\n\n65\\. A new product cannot be successful if it will inevitably harm the lives of some people.\n\n66\\. Our perspective is limited to the sum of our experiences, and the sum of any individual’s experiences is limited.\n\n67\\. The only way we can create a Web3 for all the people is by getting out of our bubbles and exposing ourselves to different perspectives and lived experiences.\n\n68\\. Diversity is a non-negotiable for building Web3. If we want to build a web that will cater to people from all over the world and all backgrounds, we need to involve people from all over the world and all backgrounds.\n\n69\\. Many of our intentions with building Web3 are similar to our intentions with building the original web. If we don’t learn from history, we’ll repeat it.\n\n70\\. Fun fact: NFTs were invented in 1958.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1433179887708344321?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1433179887708344321?s=20)\n\n71\\. We accept many things in life without question for no reason other than that’s how it’s always been.\n\n72\\. If we can learn to question basic principles in life, we can allow ourselves to create a better world.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1444005218698498048?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1444005218698498048?s=20)\n\n73\\. It’s very easy to get burnt out in crypto.\n\n74\\. Intentionally blocking off time away from the screen is good for your mental health.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1444467146512285699?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1444467146512285699?s=20)\n\n75\\. We need to be able to have safe and open conversations about mental health that don’t feel taboo or judged.\n\n76\\. Crypto moves fast, but you won’t be able to move at all without your health.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1442691934355476485?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1442691934355476485?s=20)\n\n77\\. It’s good to have hobbies outside of crypto.\n\n78\\. I recommend finding hobbies that involve getting outside, doing something physical, and interacting with human beings IRL.\n\n79\\. People like having responsibilities (not obligations) because it gives them a sense of ownership.\n\n80\\. Your community will be stronger if you let them have a voice and a vote.\n\n81\\. Community is more important in crypto than in any other industry I’ve been in, perhaps because we’re still in the early days of building.\n\n82\\. We’re still in the early days of crypto.\n\n83\\. Despite how it may look today, crypto is not about helping the rich get richer; it’s about helping those who weren’t able to earn wealth in our legacy system earn wealth in Web3.\n\n84\\. Web3 and DeFi will even out the playing field for all groups of people and finally give disadvantaged communities an opportunity to overcome the systemic bias that has worked against them for generations.\n\n85\\. The only way to eliminate human bias is to take humans out of the equation.\n\n86\\. If a smart contract is coded in a nondiscriminatory fashion, it cannot choose to discriminate at a later date.\n\n87\\. Most people don’t think enough about online privacy.\n\n88\\. Privacy is a fundamental human right, and valuing that right doesn’t mean you have something to hide.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1443342754386366465?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1443342754386366465?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/SecretNetwork/status/1446566598257651718?s=20](https://twitter.com/SecretNetwork/status/1446566598257651718?s=20)\n\n89\\. Being anon online provides that extra layer of privacy - and safety.\n\n90\\. You don’t have to know someone’s legal identity to be able to relate to them.\n\n91\\. Remember that there’s a real human face behind every anon account you interact with.\n\n92\\. Time is a strange thing in crypto, where a year can feel like a decade.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1441017328725118976?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1441017328725118976?s=20)\n\n93\\. Time passes especially fast in a bull run.\n\n94\\. Try not to get burnt out during the bull runs so you are energized to build during the bear markets.\n\n95\\. Focus on the long term vision, not short term gains.\n\n96\\. Right now many people are priced out of becoming crypto native. This is a problem we need to solve.\n\n97\\. We also need to improve wallet UX so that the burden of safely storing your keys doesn’t come with such harsh consequences.\n\n98\\. When DeFi and NFTs and DAOs and social tokens figure out a way to combine forces, that’s when the magic happens.\n\n99\\. It’s only a matter of time until we onboard all 4.6+ billion internet users to Web3.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1435463584146886658?s=20](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1435463584146886658?s=20)\n\n100\\.

I ended up RTing that and asking if anyone wanted to get tattoos in NYC the following week during Messari Mainnet - mostly as a joke and not expecting anyone to actually respond.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1437601009933684738?s=20](https://twitter.com/ddwchen/status/1437601009933684738?s=20)\n\nMatt, Lauren, Stef, and Jim were some of the first people to show support and excitement for this idea.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/H6Bgu2Oxs-9Lcc8F7QJPZ.png?height=682&width=884)\n\n## ...turned into a DAO\n\nEvin then aped in when we were grabbing coffee the morning of our tattoo appointment and suggested forming a DAO to NFT-pill tattoo artists. She had never gotten a tattoo before.\n\nOne thing led to another and before we knew it, 10 of us were gathered at Three Kings in Brooklyn on September 22, 2021 waiting to get matching ERC-721 tattoos. Our first governance vote was to decide which font to use for our tattoos. No doubt the tattoo parlor thought we were a cult, and who can blame them?\n\nFour of us ended up getting our tattoos that night from [Gustavo](https://www.instagram.com/gustavorizerioart/), and several others would return over the course of the next few days. As we took turns getting inked by him, we also took turns crypto-pilling him - helping him set up a wallet, explaining what NFTs are, and getting him his first NFT from [Matt Condon’s hand](https://themanymatts.lol/).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BwN_dOTNq98aGSxsIxfay.jpeg?height=960&width=1280)\n\nThe day after the gathering at Three Kings, pet3rpan tweeted\n\n[https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1441067792812417028?s=20](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1441067792812417028?s=20)\n\nfollowed by\n\n[https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1441132311316074497?s=20](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1441132311316074497?s=20)\n\nThese tweets caught the attention of a number of people, including DeFi Dave, who got his proof of ink a mere two hours after seeing the tweets.\n\nOther notable moments included an [ERC trio tat](https://twitter.com/1ofthemanymatts/status/1441586754801242113?s=20), [three ERC-721 tats in one night](https://twitter.com/ink_dao/status/1444652283984154625?s=20), and [DeFi Papi and NFT Mami getting their tats in the same location](https://twitter.com/ink_dao/status/1442940439946952704?s=20) on their bodies without talking about it in advance.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ink_dao/status/1444652283984154625?s=20](https://twitter.com/ink_dao/status/1444652283984154625?s=20)\n\n## Crypto pilling tattoo artists everywhere\n\n$INK DAO started as a joke but has grown into a group of people who are passionate about educating tattoo artists everywhere about crypto and NFTs.\n\nTattoo artists no longer need to rely solely on bookings from the tattoo shop they work at for an income. They can now mint and sell their artwork as NFTs, helping them to grow their income and their following.\n\nTaking it one step further, tattoo artists can spin up all sorts of creative ways to sell their NFTs. They could create 1:1 NFT pieces that can be burned and redeemed for a physical tattoo. Or they could create a collection of 10 pieces that can be held, sold, or burned, which could turn the collection into an economic game between its holders.\n\nThe sky’s the limit with NFTs and we can’t wait to help educate and bring tattoo artists everywhere into crypto.", "timestamp": 1635189816, "digest": "1Utj1qnN4Maxtxt8U6WChWTDxg6gL_Pla1rAmuwmBE0", "contributor": "0xcEd09CCFc82b091195bdE04E6Cd65374518E7b95"}

{"id": "oYIHGH42Ze4bGRUwWH22shbTdegDjpy3VdB4dMNXXoo", "title": "STARS Token Distribution", "body": "Stargaze is one of the first NFT markets to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Cosmos is a network of custom interoperable blockchains. It is currently the second largest ecosystem by volume, and includes Terra, Cosmos Hub, Thorchain, and Osmosis.\n\nStargaze aims to be a decentralized NFT market, totally owned and governed by its users. Therefore, distribution of STARS has to be equitable, accessible, and cover a large surface area.\n\n## Token Release Schedule\n\nA fair initial distribution is pivotal in setting the future direction of a network. Paired with a thoughtful inflationary release schedule, a network can optimize its token distribution.\n\nThe distribution of STARS is designed to front-load inflation in order to bootstrap the network. This is a similar issuance schedule to Bitcoin. However, instead of halvings, issuance will be cut by 1/3 each year (by multiplying the current issuance by a reduction factor of 67%). Osmosis was the first protocol to use a [“thirding” token release schedule](https://medium.com/osmosis/osmo-token-distribution-ae27ea2bb4db) and heavily inspired Stargaze’s design.\n\nFor some background on using token incentives to bootstrap new networks, check out this great [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619?s=20) by Chris Dixon.\n\n![\"Thirding\" release schedule](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TwRgLvwwmYuxQ8c4BqR3f.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nStargaze will start with an initial supply of 1 billion STARS. An additional 1 billion STARS will be issued the first year. With this \"thirding\" schedule, the issuance for the following year will be 670M STARS. This leads to an **asymptotic max supply of 4.03 billion STARS**.\n\n![Max supply formula](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_q9lx8h-BE1KNjYqE-Cht.png?height=186&width=998)\n\n![Issuance calculations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vm2RIO5fD2J3EVOVRP01W.png?height=1916&width=1592)\n\nStargaze starts off decentralized on day one with a genesis supply that distributes the majority of the tokens to community members. The Foundation will hold a strategic reserve of tokens, and will drive adoption of the protocol by delegating to validators, onboarding creators, and providing grants for ecosystem development.\n\n![Community-focused genesis supply](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tQ6Q0otaxfb8_7aCc4_GN.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter 5 years, the initial distribution is only 27.6% of the entire token supply. This issuance schedule allows Stargaze to grow and adapt its ownership to new creators, curators, validators, delegators, and other stakeholders.\n\n![Genesis supply vs. new issuance after 5 years](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k_VH9Rk86klZ7IXo2ZbKC.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\n## Airdrop\n\nThe goal of the Stargaze airdrop is to reach the most active participants in the Cosmos ecosystem. Stakers and liquidity providers are more likely to be more active than just token holders. Therefore, Stargaze is doing its airdrop to a mix of network participants:\n\n* **ATOM stakers**\n* **OSMO stakers or liquidity providers**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Cosmos Hub**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Osmosis**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Regen Network**\n\nFor each role above, you will be able to claim **1,998 STARS**. Distributing a fixed amount is in the spirit of the original Uniswap airdrop, giving every user more or less an equal starting point. In order to claim your airdrop, you have to perform 4-5 actions on Stargaze when it launches. If you have used [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) or [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), you’re already familiar with performing tasks to claim tokens. Some claimable actions include bidding on NFTs, staking, and voting in governance.\n\nSome minimums were put in place to prevent dust accounts and those attempting to game airdrops:\n\n* **ATOM staker: 5 ATOM minimum staked**\n* **OSMO staker: 50 OSMO minimum staked**\n\nFurthermore, delegations to centralized exchange validators were excluded.\n\nFor example, if you’re an ATOM staker and OSMO LP, and meet the above minimums, then your airdrop reward is 3,996 STARS.\n\nOsmosis liquidity providers get the airdrop regardless if LP tokens are bonded or not.\n\nAirdrop claimable amounts start decaying 4 months after the launch of the NFT market. The decaying process linearly decreases the claimable amount for another 4 months.\n\n![Airdrop must be claimed to prevent decay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3_QgqhG1LETOtyBdL0a7P.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter the airdrop claim period, unclaimed STARS are sent to the Community Pool.\n\nSnapshots were taken on Oct 11th, 2021 from Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and Regen Network.\n\nTo see how much STARS you’re eligible to claim, please visit <https://stargaze.zone/airdrop>.\n\n***Note: Airdrops won’t be claimable until after Phase 3 of launch. Please see Phase 3 below.***\n\nhttp://stargaze.zone/airdrop\n\n## Reward Distribution\n\nNew token reward distribution will be optimized to facilitate the operations of the NFT market.\n\nThe initial breakdown per block will be:\n\n![Per block distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UzjJ1v4qZ-bF5zw1BY9kr.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAll chain parameters can be changed via governance vote. Everything suggested in this post are sensible defaults. We expect governance to adapt and change the protocol as it matures.\n\n### NFT Incentives\n\n45% of block rewards are set aside for NFT bidding and staking incentives. Token holders will be able to earn yield by bidding and staking on NFTs for certain periods of time. An upcoming post will outline this mechanic in detail.\n\nIf governance determines that NFT incentives are too high for achieving the desired effect of the protocol, they may direct these incentives towards the Community Pool where they can be spent later.\n\n### Staking Rewards\n\nAs per the course with proof-of-stake networks, validators (node operators) earn rewards for securing the network. They also accept delegations from token holders, and charge a commission of 5% or greater for providing the service. \n\nNearly 100 validators were selected to join mainnet after 3 testnets, 2 of which were incentivized. They will earn 35% of all block rewards.\n\n### Developer Rewards\n\nInitially, 15% of block rewards will go to fund the team that contributes to the development of Stargaze. Each account gets a specific weight set by governance. When a developer is no longer contributing, governance can choose to modify their weight or remove their allocation.\n\n### Community Pool\n\nThe Community Pool is the main DAO that operates the network. It is responsible for voting on parameter changes, software upgrades, community matters, and more. It will receive 5% of all block rewards.\n\n## Phased Launch\n\nSince Stargaze is a layer 1 blockchain with many moving parts, it will launch in phases.\n\n* **Phase 0: Chain launch with 0% inflation (Oct 29th)**\n* **Phase 1: Liquidity pools on [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and [Gravity DEX](https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/)**\n* **Phase 2: Governance proposal to enable inflation**\n* **Phase 3: Web app launch with first NFT drop**\n\nMore details about the liquidity pools will be forthcoming. Please follow us on social media (links below) for updates. They are planned for 2-3 weeks after Phase 0, and have to go through governance to be funded via the Community Pool.\n\nNew tokens won’t be issued until after Phase 2, when inflation kicks in. At this time you’ll be able to stake STARS at [stargaze.zone](http://stargaze.zone/) via [Keplr Wallet](http://keplr.app/).\n\nPhase 3 is expected to be completed before the end of the year. Airdrops will be claimable starting in this phase.\n\n## Follow Us\n\nTo follow along with Stargaze developments, check us out on Twitter at <https://twitter.com/StargazeZone>, and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StargazeZone\n\n[https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE)\n\nHappy Stargazing ✨🔭", "timestamp": 1635190988, "digest": "h9Bc7jODUrYB1Jw4mve3QEGVkBwBsyVebN6NP7tRl_Y", "contributor": "0x57a9Cb03cC8Ed919162d9024710ca9E886346299"}

Questioned on why the grid fins on the new Starship don’t fold, Elon Musk dropped an incredible gem on how to think about development processes (or anything, really). Didn’t expect to find this in a YouTube video touring Starbase, but here we go.\n\nYou can find the tour and interview, done by Everyday Astronaut, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t705r8ICkRw\\&t=1123s). This is me mostly transcribing.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43f615cb-074f-4b06-8411-c0028a6ad9e0\\_2880x1684.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43f615cb-074f-4b06-8411-c0028a6ad9e0\\_2880x1684.png)\n\n## Elon’s Development Process\n\n1.  **Make your requirements less dumb**\n\n    It does not matter who gave them to you. Especially if they come from a smart person, because you question them less. Don’t take things as gospel. No matter who you are, everybody is wrong some of the time.\n\n    And whatever requirement or constraint you have, it must come with the name of a person, not a department. You can’t ask departments, you have to ask a person. That person must take responsibility for that requirement.\n\n2.  **Delete a part or process step**\n\n    Try very hard to delete the part of process. This is actually very important. If you are not occasionally adding something back in, at least 10% of the time, you are not deleting enough. There is often a bias to add this part or process step “in case we need it” but you can make an “in case” argument for pretty much anything.\n\n    Thats why the grid fins do not fold down. It’s a whole extra mechanism thats not needed. They simulated it and saw no difference. And it in case they do find out they need them, they can add them back in later.\n\n3.  **Simplify or optimise**\n\n    This the third step, not the first step. Why? The most common error of a smart engineer is to optimise a thing that shouldn't exist. Why is that? Everybody is trained to do so. Convergent logic, you are trained to answer questions, you can’t say to your professor the question is dumb. Everybody has a mental straightjacket on, optimising the thing that should not exist.\n\n4.  **Accelerate Cycle-Time.**\n\n    You are too slow. Go faster. But don't go faster until you did the other three things first. If you are digging your grave, don’t dig it faster. Stop digging your grave.\n\n5.  **Automate**\n\n    Thats the final step.\n\n> *I have personally made the mistake of going backwards on all five steps multiple times. Where I literally automated, accelerated, simplified and then deleted.* – Elon Musk\n\nHere is one examples to illustrate **how not to go** through this process:\n\n**Fiberglass Mats on the Model 3**\n\nAt Tesla, they had these fiberglass mats on top of the Model 3 battery packs. The mats were a chokepoint in the battery pack production line. Musk described he was basically living on the production line trying to fix this. It was chocking the entire Model 3 production program.\n\nMusk tried to fix the automation first, making the robot better, make it move faster, shorter paths, increase the torque, etc. So automating was a mistake, accelerating was a mistake, then optimising was a mistake. And finally he asked, what the hell are these mats for?\n\nThe battery safety team told him they are for noise and vibration, the Noise & Vibration team said they are for fire safety…you get the idea. So finally they tried a car with the figerglass mats and without, they put a microphone in both – and couldn’t tell the difference. In the end Tesla just deleted that step, bypassing a 2M$ robot installation.\n\nThis framework really stuck with me and I hope you find it interesting as well.\n", "timestamp": 1635191050, "digest": "y5SHOu9zhQ4_Fub3gYxtgfEvw_3DvuCcl4VrlSY259E", "contributor": "0xfeFC5Db73F46B9635f988679f673898955AfF3CA"}
{"id": "dH9t3AFE5u-h0XAeX3c7OB691mCS0t1Pm-sNxzQRZew", "title": "DAOs: the anti-government, government clubs", "body": "Governments as we know them are broken. Representatives lie, steal and claim to be impartial while becoming some of the wealthiest individuals on the planet, utilizing their public goods facade to generate alpha and rug pull the population.\n\n[https://twitter.com/chipfranklin/status/1443664452239298584](https://twitter.com/chipfranklin/status/1443664452239298584)\n\nMeanwhile the same profiteering puppets make decisions over human rights, infrastructure, health care and other essential services, while balancing their own conflicts of interest. That’s really the issue with governments, not the controversial mandates or their execution, it’s the inescapable COIs.\n\nJust because a mandate is to provide neutral services, doesn’t mean administrators are themselves neutral. Incentives of government officials do not align with incentives of a “government” and thus so frequently they are consumed with corruption.\n\n> ### Why do we pretend like self-interests of government officials don’t exist and why are we surprised when their molochian desires appear?\n\nDespite the potential altruism of government martyrs who choose to represent social contracts of a state, an individual’s game theory is not the same as the expected game theory of the public’s well-being. Providing public goods doesn’t equal no incentives.\n\nA reason officials often **seek corruption** is because they do not rid themselves of self-interests by being a member of the government, they are **simply pretending they cannot be corrupt.** It’s like we collectively took an oath that pretending they couldn’t be corrupt would make them less corrupt, rather than accepting natural human gluttony.\n\nMass incarceration for bad behavior doesn’t always lead to less of the bad behavior, it often has the opposite effect and makes the bad behavior more dangerous. For example, the [decriminalization has often been more successful than](https://time.com/longform/portugal-drug-use-decriminalization/) criminalization; like the decriminalization of illicit drugs in Portugal that reduced the social cost of drug misuse by 18%.\n\nIn the government’s case, our solution should **not be to try and force unwavering altruism**, but rather accept elements of self-interest and bake the right rewards into the job to provide public benefit yet mitigate harm - decriminalize corruption.\n\n## DAO as an anti-government, government\n\nMilton Friedman believed in decentralized approaches to running societies such that “governments” should only oversee monetary policy and free markets should decide all other services. I view DAOs as the solution: **efficient coordination of free-market behaviors to optimize public interests.**\n\nWe typically expect these things from neutral governing bodies representing the people:\n\n1. Public Goods Funding - *ie. education*\n2. Economic Assistance & Emergency Aid *- ie. welfare*\n3. Financial Regulation - *ie. monetary policy*\n4. Security & Justice - *ie. military*\n\nThese same objectives are mandated by protocols in Web3. However, DAOs let us programmatically motivate public goods without aggregating all workers under an opaque “government” structure. In fact, most DAO members do not work at the same organization, sometimes have conflicting goals, yet manage to harmonize around the same mission.\n\nAnyone can be rewarded for their efforts in a DAO. Instead of mass denial of self-interests, DAOs embrace the reality of incentive alignment between participants/contributors.\n\n### In that lens, DAOs are the capitalist public goods allocators, the free-market’s project manager, the programmatic invisible hand.\n\nDAOs are the free market implementation for providing public goods. The mandate of a DAO smart contract can be partial to a protocol’s well being, while DAO contributors can be rewarded with private incentives to drive their own business models - eg. as grants, full-time funding, knowledge-sharing or social reputation. The underlying social consensus of a DAO aims to balance the DAO’s goals with contributor incentives, not hinder the existence of these mechanics.\n\nMoreover, inherent transparency of DAOs makes it near impossible to feign non-corruption, since any/all behavior can be checked by voters or observers. Smart contracts allow members to be voted in/out without notice, assess on-chain conviction or ragequit. The modularity also means there is little loyalty to one proposal or another, the only loyalty is to merit and accountability.\n\n> *“The people have responsibility, the government doesn’t have responsibility”*\n>\n> *- Milton Friedman*\n\nIncentivize members of governing bodies in such a way that they do not need to abuse their power to be incentivized, and furthermore *cannot* abuse their power. DAOs.\n\n[https://twitter.com/nope_its_lily/status/1444375731551674368?s=19](https://twitter.com/nope_its_lily/status/1444375731551674368?s=19)\n\n**Reach me:**\n\n* Twitter - [@evabeylin](https://twitter.com/evabeylin)\n* About me - [🦋👽⚡👽🦋.y.at](https://t.co/FWzUGiNnlI?amp=1)\n\n**Other Sources:**\n\n[https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/friedman-government-problem-1993.pdf](https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/friedman-government-problem-1993.pdf)\n\nMilton Friedman lectures on youtube", "timestamp": 1635191697, "digest": "CTYcX41ImVRl_KeOVYxLm12Hsk4jREOZXm1R0EBPge4", "contributor": "0x51976F2C831640098b12b678Be637aF21A3cAB06"}

Paired with a thoughtful inflationary release schedule, a network can optimize its token distribution.\n\nThe distribution of STARS is designed to front-load inflation in order to bootstrap the network. This is a similar issuance schedule to Bitcoin. However, instead of halvings, issuance will be cut by 1/3 each year (by multiplying the current issuance by a reduction factor of 67%). Osmosis was the first protocol to use a [“thirding” token release schedule](https://medium.com/osmosis/osmo-token-distribution-ae27ea2bb4db) and heavily inspired Stargaze’s design.\n\nFor some background on using token incentives to bootstrap new networks, check out this great [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619?s=20) by Chris Dixon.\n\n![\"Thirding\" release schedule](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TwRgLvwwmYuxQ8c4BqR3f.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nStargaze will start with an initial supply of 1 billion STARS. An additional 1 billion STARS will be issued the first year. With this \"thirding\" schedule, the issuance for the following year will be 670M STARS. This leads to an **asymptotic max supply of 4.03 billion STARS**.\n\n![Max supply formula](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_q9lx8h-BE1KNjYqE-Cht.png?height=186&width=998)\n\n![Issuance calculations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vm2RIO5fD2J3EVOVRP01W.png?height=1916&width=1592)\n\nStargaze starts off decentralized on day one with a genesis supply that distributes the majority of the tokens to community members. The Foundation will hold a strategic reserve of tokens, and will drive adoption of the protocol by delegating to validators, onboarding creators, and providing grants for ecosystem development.\n\n![Community-focused genesis supply](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZTtjhTqZNqm1rNESQq8j2.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter 5 years, the initial distribution is only 27.6% of the entire token supply. This issuance schedule allows Stargaze to grow and adapt its ownership to new creators, curators, validators, delegators, and other stakeholders.\n\n![Genesis supply vs. new issuance after 5 years](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k_VH9Rk86klZ7IXo2ZbKC.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\n## Airdrop\n\nThe goal of the Stargaze airdrop is to reach the most active participants in the Cosmos ecosystem. Stakers and liquidity providers are more likely to be more active than just token holders. Therefore, Stargaze is doing its airdrop to a mix of network participants:\n\n* **ATOM stakers**\n* **OSMO stakers or liquidity providers**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Cosmos Hub**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Osmosis**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Regen Network**\n\nFor each role above, you will be able to claim **1,998 STARS**. Distributing a fixed amount is in the spirit of the original Uniswap airdrop, giving every user more or less an equal starting point. In order to claim your airdrop, you have to perform 4-5 actions on Stargaze when it launches. If you have used [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) or [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), you’re already familiar with performing tasks to claim tokens. Some claimable actions include bidding on NFTs, staking, and voting in governance.\n\nSome minimums were put in place to prevent dust accounts and those attempting to game airdrops:\n\n* **ATOM staker: 5 ATOM minimum staked**\n* **OSMO staker: 50 OSMO minimum staked**\n\nFurthermore, delegations to centralized exchange validators were excluded.\n\nFor example, if you’re an ATOM staker and OSMO LP, and meet the above minimums, then your airdrop reward is 3,996 STARS.\n\nOsmosis liquidity providers get the airdrop regardless if LP tokens are bonded or not.\n\nAirdrop claimable amounts start decaying 4 months after the launch of the NFT market. The decaying process linearly decreases the claimable amount for another 4 months.\n\n![Airdrop must be claimed to prevent decay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3_QgqhG1LETOtyBdL0a7P.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter the airdrop claim period, unclaimed STARS are sent to the Community Pool.\n\nSnapshots were taken on Oct 11th, 2021 from Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and Regen Network.\n\nTo see how much STARS you’re eligible to claim, please visit <https://stargaze.zone/airdrop>.\n\n***Note: Airdrops won’t be claimable until after Phase 3 of launch. Please see Phase 3 below.***\n\nhttp://stargaze.zone/airdrop\n\n## Reward Distribution\n\nNew token reward distribution will be optimized to facilitate the operations of the NFT market.\n\nThe initial breakdown per block will be:\n\n![Per block distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UzjJ1v4qZ-bF5zw1BY9kr.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAll chain parameters can be changed via governance vote. Everything suggested in this post are sensible defaults. We expect governance to adapt and change the protocol as it matures.\n\n### NFT Incentives\n\n45% of block rewards are set aside for NFT bidding and staking incentives. Token holders will be able to earn yield by bidding and staking on NFTs for certain periods of time. An upcoming post will outline this mechanic in detail.\n\nIf governance determines that NFT incentives are too high for achieving the desired effect of the protocol, they may direct these incentives towards the Community Pool where they can be spent later.\n\n### Staking Rewards\n\nAs per the course with proof-of-stake networks, validators (node operators) earn rewards for securing the network. They also accept delegations from token holders, and charge a commission of 5% or greater for providing the service.\n\nNearly 100 validators were selected to join mainnet after 3 testnets, 2 of which were incentivized. They will earn 35% of all block rewards.\n\n### Developer Rewards\n\nInitially, 15% of block rewards will go to fund the team that contributes to the development of Stargaze. Each account gets a specific weight set by governance. When a developer is no longer contributing, governance can choose to modify their weight or remove their allocation.\n\n### Community Pool\n\nThe Community Pool is the main DAO that operates the network. It is responsible for voting on parameter changes, software upgrades, community matters, and more. It will receive 5% of all block rewards.\n\n## Phased Launch\n\nSince Stargaze is a layer 1 blockchain with many moving parts, it will launch in phases.\n\n* **Phase 0: Chain launch with 0% inflation (Oct 29th)**\n* **Phase 1: Liquidity pools on [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and [Gravity DEX](https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/)**\n* **Phase 2: Governance proposal to enable inflation**\n* **Phase 3: Web app launch with first NFT drop**\n\nMore details about the liquidity pools will be forthcoming. Please follow us on social media (links below) for updates. They are planned for 2-3 weeks after Phase 0, and have to go through governance to be funded via the Community Pool.\n\nNew tokens won’t be issued until after Phase 2, when inflation kicks in. At this time you’ll be able to stake STARS at [stargaze.zone](http://stargaze.zone/) via [Keplr Wallet](http://keplr.app/).\n\nPhase 3 is expected to be completed before the end of the year. Airdrops will be claimable starting in this phase.\n\n## Follow Us\n\nTo follow along with Stargaze developments, check us out on Twitter at <https://twitter.com/StargazeZone>, and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StargazeZone\n\n[https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE)\n\nHappy Stargazing ✨🔭", "timestamp": 1635191433, "digest": "h9Bc7jODUrYB1Jw4mve3QEGVkBwBsyVebN6NP7tRl_Y", "contributor": "0x57a9Cb03cC8Ed919162d9024710ca9E886346299"}

，阐述总结了古典园林的特点，并结合相关案例，归纳并探讨西方现代园林与古典园林之间的关系。重点从营造手法方面分析与阐述了西方现代园林对古典园林的继承与发展，启迪今后现代园林的创作与实践。\n\n中国和法国的传统园林都在世界园林史上占据非常重要的地位，深入探讨西方景观园林的营造思想和手法，总结法国古典景观园林的景观特色、造园思想与造园要素，结合法国最优秀现代园林进行对比分析，将有助于解读西方现代园林对古典园林的继承与发展。\n\n随着世界城市全球化，东方与西方的对话与融合将是人类社会发展的必然，当代的我国园林设计师唯有拓宽视野、学贯中西、放眼全球，才能顺应时代的潮流，创造出有自己风格的新园林景观。\n\n### 一、法国古典园林的产生背景与特点\n\n  17世纪下半叶，路易十四彻底巩固了国家的统一和封建专制制度，把绝对君权推向顶峰。这一时期是法国科学和哲学兴盛的时代，也是古典主义文艺思潮席卷法国和欧洲的时代。当时的政治制度、美学哲学思想及西方古典主义绘画的特点，都对古典主义造园艺术产生了深远的影响。\n\n**古典园林的造园思想与景观特色**\n\n  西方园林营造思想是一种通过控制自然、征服自然来实现自然美的自然美学思想。强调“驾驭自然，改造自然，强迫自然接受均衡的法则”。法国古典园林的景观形态所体现的基本上是一种建筑美，诉诸简明、规则的几何图案，人们常将法国式园林比喻为“绿色建筑”。\n\n  古典主义造园家勒诺特尔从法国的国土风貌中提炼出平原、密林、农田、河流等要素，形成几何形的台地、丛林、花坛、运河、水池等要素，并按照对称均衡的原则布置成一个和谐的空间。图案式的丛林、花坛、草坪、水面组成一系列“绿色厅堂”，如同一座巨大的“绿色宫殿”。法国古典园林从凡尔赛到枫丹白露，园林的布局都是几何板块式的，植物也经过经心修剪布置，规矩方正的草坪和水渠，无一不表现出严整规则的秩序感。\n\n### 二、西方古典园林营造原理和造园法则\n\n2\\.1 几何学原理与规则式园林造园法则\n\n  规则式园林的要素及空间皆显示出明确的几何形式，所以又称“几何式园林”；它的造园要素形式规整、布置整齐，树木花草修剪整形，还称“整形式园林”；而规模宏大、地势平坦、以模纹花坛著称的法国古典主义园林则被人们称为“平面图案式园林”。纵观法国古典造园历史，基于逻辑与理性的规则式园林正是从几何学中开出的花朵，从现代西方园林中也能看到其永恒的影响。\n\n  早在公元前3 000年的古埃及、古印度和古巴比伦时期，就出现了有关几何学的记载。随着几何学的发展，人们对客观事物的认知也在不断加深。几何学的研究对象从图形到体积，从平面到立体，从空间到太空，极大地扩大了西方人的视野和研究领域。几何学研究方法也从运用公理来推论、到论证公理本身、再到公理法体系的建立，此为由“象”入“理”。大大地提高了人们的思维和论证能力，为严谨的合乎理性的园林设计方法的形成打下了坚实的基础。 \n\n2\\.2  美学思想与规则式园林造园法则\n\n  毕达哥拉斯把“数”看作是一切事物的本质，强调事物的性质是由某种数量关系所决定的，并且万物按照一定的数量比例而构成和谐的秩序，据此提出了“美在和谐”这一著名的美学命题。亚里士多德也说：“数学能促进人们对美的特性——数值、比例、秩序等的认识”，强调数学研究方法对美学研究的作用，认为“美的主要形式是秩序、匀称与明确”，指出井然有序、整体均衡在审美中的重要作用。古典主义美学追求一种绝对的、永恒的“美”的概念，“美产生于尺度和比例”，这正是古典造园师创造“美”的标尺。 \n\n总结得出，几何学对古典主义园林的影响主要体现在两个方面：\n\n（1）形成了基于空间的造园要素和布局结构等形式风格。——古典的几何学以图形空间为主要研究对象，本身是一种直观性很强的视觉艺术，促使园林在要素和空间上出现几何形体化倾向。\n\n（2）产生了基于理性的美学思想和创作方法等造园理论。——建立在数学、几何学基础之上的美学原则，把追求简洁、对称、均衡、统一视为核心价值，强调比例、尺度的重要作用。景物、轴线、空间等布局经过深思熟虑，都是理性思维的产物。 \n\n2\\.3  几何学原理在实际造园中的具体运用——透视原理的运用\n\n   中国绘画与西方绘画具有完全不同的表达方式——西方古典绘画重视写生和描摹，而中国绘画重在写意。因此，西方人发明了焦点透视，来再现真实的自然；东方则利用多重角度的“看”，来达到某种完整的表达。这两种不同的视觉逻辑可被总结为“注视”和“扫视”。\n\n ·中国画——平面性——表达空间深度——利用扫视的路径逻辑来推动并作画面的记录  \n\n ·西方古典主义绘画——透视法 选一个最佳透视点 表达真实三维空间——利用定点欣赏即注视的逻辑来作画面的记录  注重静止的欣赏\n\n 因此在西方的造园过程中，重要视点上的画面营造尤为重要——为了在重要视点上创造更加均衡的画面，需要对透视效果加以巧妙的校正。比如古典主义园林规模宏大，随着中轴线的不断延伸，难免出现线条、图形、空间的透视变形问题，必须对极其深远的透视带来的变形加以修正，透视原理被巧妙地用来加强或减弱空间的深远感。\n\n### 三、西方现代园林对古典园林的继承与发展\n\n3\\.1 领土意识的传承与转化——整体性\n\n  法国古典主义园林无论面积的大小，都会有与外界环境紧密对话，通过园林中轴线空间无限的延伸，将园林中的自然景观渗透进入城市之中。 整体性的设计理念将各类要素紧密编织进花园的空间结构体系中，并通过相互之间的联系，层层拓展开来。 法国现代园林景观设计深受到这一理念的影响，逐渐形成了领土景观意识。\n\n  但要注意的是，在法国古典主义花园中，空间拓展是以花园为主体，以外部环境为辅助。 在当时的时代背景下，花园为掌权者建造，不需要过多的考虑城市的问题或其他人的使用需求。而现代公园的规划设计却需要将思路与意识反转，公园本身要以谦卑的态度融于领土景观。花园作为客体寻求与外部环境的融合，以最好服务市民，是顺应现代城市发展的必然结果。\n\n  园林与城市为一体的整体性意识得以传承，但现代园林景观与古典主义园林在空间拓展上完全相反的设计思路，正是随着时代变迁而注定发生的转化。 \n\n3\\.2 造园手法的继承与发展\n\n3\\.2.1传承与发展——清晰的空间结构\n\n法国古典园林特点\n\n·轴线的嬗变\n\n法国古典主义园林清晰的空间结构来源于轴线的统领作用，并通过控制地形、 组织视线，来实现空间的集中性和画面感。\n\n·主次对比\n\n法国古典主义园林构图强调分清主次，通过以轴线景观为主体，次要轴线辅助；空间结构上以中心开阔的大空间与周围规则郁闭的小空间对比，通过对称的几何形式强化了空间结构，统率全局。\n\n  通过几世纪的演变，法国现代园林与古典主义园林具有根本性的差异。 古典主义园林体现皇权至上的设计理念，决定了其庞大的尺度感与集中式的空间流线。 轴线是园林中最为重要的游览路径与景观视廊，串联所有最精致的设计元素。\n\n  而现代园林景观更多地满足公共空间使用的需求，不再是统治者的个人享受，同时尺度也更亲人。轴线成为了更小尺度上的空间控制要素，在一些公园、城市广场中虽仍能分辨出空间布局中轴线的存在，但它们被打散分解，布局更为灵活，消融于景观之中，形成了分散、丰富的空间流线。\n\n3\\.2.2 传承与发展——构图几何与强烈的形式特征\n\n  当理解“构图几何”时，不应只是狭隘地拘泥于圆、方等形式语言，应理解到现代园林景观绝不是简单地原样照搬图案花纹样式，而是运用图案式形式语言的整体布局模式，及抽象部分形态要素。与古典主义园林相比，现代园林所体现出的空间形态和构图样式比古典图案式更为简洁、灵活、多变。同时，精准的构图几何关系，则进一步强化清晰空间结构。\n\n  雪铁龙公园的整体空间结构就是一个具有强烈个性与创造性的典型。该公园的空间结构严谨规整，两个玻璃温室及中间的喷泉水景，大草坪及草坪南侧的大台阶，白色拱桥共同形成了一条隐晦的中心线。温室高约15m，长45m，成为控制大草坪的重要建筑元素。温室之间的喷泉整体倾斜向大草坪，进一步增强了空间的关联性和中心线的整体趋势。公园的中心大草坪长约300m，宽约100m，以极小的倾斜坡度整体趋向于塞纳河岸，两侧的植物、 构筑物和方形的高篱以对称的形式语言强化了轴线的结构，自然的河流成为轴线的结点。\n\n3\\.3 传承与发展——造园要素的现代演绎\n\n  法国古典园林图案语言在法国古典主义园林中，简洁的几何形体是最主要的形式语言。形式语言极强的造园要素，按照理性逻辑精心排列在公园中，形成一帧帧清晰精致的景观。这一章节将具体解构巴黎雪铁龙公园，并分析幻想花园的景观序列，揭示西方现代公园是怎样提取古典园林中的造园要素，抽象并恰到好处的运用在设计中。\n\n3\\.3.1 植物要素\n\n 法国园林的理论基础来自建筑学，树木的规则式种植、几何形修剪，正是为了构成“绿色建筑”的规则造型。单一植物品种丛植能使整个群落在形状、色彩、季相变化、生长速度等方便保持一致，从而保证“绿色建筑”的稳定性。平坦的草坪不仅有利于烘托各“绿色建筑”群的鲜明轮廓，其本身也是“绿色广场”。运用植物要素的相互组合分隔空间，同时营造宁静、典雅的花园气氛。\n\n3\\.3.2 建筑要素\n\n  雕塑作为建筑艺术的附属品，一直在法国园林中占有非常重要的地位。它不仅用于装饰花园中的住宅，还常与喷泉组合或是独立地布置在花园中，形成局部景点的构图中心。\n\n3\\.3.3 水要素\n\n  法国古典园林中的水体大多应用法国平原上常见的湖泊、河流的形式，各种水体都呈方、园、八角形等规则的几何形状。处理手法主要有水渠、喷泉、壕沟、运河。法国园林多用静水，面积大，以气魄与宁静取胜，形成典雅、从容的风格。又称“水镜”。水镜往往都在透视和投影关系上仔细推敲过，以保证主体建筑在视角范围内完整地倒映水中。喷泉主要布置在轴线上或园路的交点上，这是法国园林中重要的造景要素之一。\n\n \n\n**案例1 雪铁龙公园**\n\n![雪铁龙公园平面图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PuruyWq6SJ9wlFXDuTH29.png?height=1140&width=1896)\n\n·法国古典园林模纹花坛——中心大草坪\n\n   刺绣花坛起源于法国古典主义园林，刺绣花坛有清晰的、简洁的边界，在矩形、方形、圆形等形体内部来实现变化丰富的花坛样式，强化艺术的震撼力。大面积的草坪为频繁运用的表现手法。\n\n  雪铁龙公园中心的大草坪被设计者命名为\"parterre vert”——绿色花坛之意，是对法国古典园林中草坪花坛的继承，它是整个设计的“核”。四周被方正的水渠围绕，与周边丰富多样的小空间形成了鲜明的对比。\n\n·丛林园——七个小花园\n\n  丛林园在意大利文艺复兴时期就开始在园林中使用。在法国古典主义园林中，丛林园常常位于中心开阔空间的周边地区，尺度小，林荫茂密，被限定在规整的方格网形式布局之中。丛林园内部是自由多样的构图形式，在每一个区域内部都分为不同的私密空间和舒适尺度。\n\n  与此对应的是温室旁的一系列小花园。中心草坪一侧的七块狭长场地结合地形，形成七个立体、半封闭的花园。这些以植物种植为主的花园各有主题。\n\n  金色园、红色园、白色园、橙色园、绿色园、蓝色园，以及“运动之园”这七个部分组成的系列空间的设计概念来自一周中的七天。设计师用色彩带给人的情感联想来诠释日常生活中人们每一天的情绪变化。并通过不同植物种类——乔木、灌木的叶色和质感以及草本植物的花色和小品、地面材质的对比以突出个性与特征。\n\n·古典园林建筑——高大树篱\n\n  在园林营造中，经常把园林植物充当建筑材料来使用。经过修剪的造型植物通常与建筑物或者构筑物相配合， 起到界定空间的作用。 高大的乔木经过整形修剪会在空间中形成边角硬朗的体块， 其高大的尺度甚至超过人工的建筑。\n\n  水渠旁边修剪的高大树篱，限定中央大草坪的空间，并作为进入周围一系列小花园的过渡。提供了竖向的围合，丰富了天际线。 \n\n·古典园林柱厅回廊——柱状树阵\n\n  西方建筑以石结构为主流，西方建筑最重要的风格特征为柱式，以古希腊建筑的3种柱式（多利克式、艾奥尼亚式、科林斯式）为典型。\n\n法国园林中，从植的植物群体或园艺群落往往由单一的或有限的几种植物构成；被修剪成几何形体，按照规则式或行列式种植。规则式的植物景观具有庄严、肃穆的气氛，给人以雄伟的气魄感。\n\n  雪铁龙公园中，修剪成柱状的树阵暗示法国古典园林的柱厅回廊，一定程度上限定中心草坪空间。\n\n·自然边界——野生散植花卉\n\n植物不再是供人赏玩的对象， 而是生态过程中与人平等的要素，在城市之中营造第一自然。具有东方园林的意味。\n\n  \n\n**案例2 西方古典园林中水的塑造——幻想花园**\n\n  幻想花园位于法国里昂和波尔多之间的泰拉松市。泰拉松镇面积不大，是一个有着悠久历史的老城市，Vezere河流经城市，幻想花园就位于河边的山坡上。幻想花园是一个东西长，南北窄的长条形花园，全园共有13个主题景点。凯瑟琳·古斯塔夫森为这个花园设计了一条环形路线，全部景点由这一条环全园的道路一一串起。主入口位于地块的最低点。\n\n  古斯塔夫森的设计有着明确的方向性，精心布置在花园中的水渠、风向标以及漂浮在林间的金色铝带明确地引导着视线，使得幻想花园的结构骨骼清晰。花架绿廊引导着人们进入花园深处，林中的金色飘带吸引人们走进森林，道路的转角处常常设有喷泉引导视线。除了具体的景观构筑物，更多推动人们向前的是看不见的景观元素：潺潺的流水声、玫瑰的香气、明亮的草坪。结构上的方向性是从一系列清晰展开的游览序列展开，其中，水作为最重要的线索贯穿于整个花园之中。\n\n![幻想花园平面图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sdeD1jX5nqpv6kn5Nop2w.jpg?height=566&width=860)\n\n  一条小路从小城向上延伸到花园大门,伴随着一条与之相平行的细水渠。沿着林地小路,浓密的黄杨木林里隐藏着几条水梯,晶莹的水流飞跃而下。\n\n 转角处草地中有两条细细的喷泉，作为水花园的前奏。进入流水园，高潮迭起：花园中几乎有着水的所有形式。流水园内部组织成传统的十字形结构,。这个水的空间被柳树和灌木丛环绕着,地面由石板铺砌,上面随意分布着若干喷水口。\n\n 水花园的十字渠充满了欧洲古典花园的味道，其中东西向的水渠向东一直延伸，渐渐高出地面，随地形有几个跌落的台阶，直直地指向远处的山峦和无尽的天边。\n\n 南北向的水渠则向南如瀑布般跌落入下面一个平静宽阔的池塘。池塘里,有多个随意安置的喷水装置。喷射出的水雾反射着阳光,水池边种着美丽的鸢尾，在水雾中形成宁静的气氛。\n\n  从水花园出来，进入到喷泉小路，齐肩篱开出多个洞口，水从小方水池叠砌的花岗岩石块流下，顺石板的缝隙流入路边的暗沟。\n\n 最后一个水景点是河流，在石子小路的路边安放有5组石板，每块石板上面刻有世界上主要的河流三角洲的平面图。水从三角洲的切口处流出，顺着带有凹槽的石板横跨过石子铺就的道路，再顺着山坡层层跌落黄杨篱边的道路。这五组水流象征了五大洲的河流。“五大洲河流”的水在流到黄杨树篱边的道路后，经过暗管回流向入口引道处的水渠。\n\n  幻想花园的设计中，水串联了各个重要景观要素的作用。引导了整个花园游览的行进序列。水流的路径可以被看作是对水的应用的进步**,**从用于灌溉到作为赏心悦目的装饰，融入场地与园林的历史。无论是倾泻而下的瀑布、潺潺的小溪，还是安静的水渠、梦幻的水雾，动水、静水和倒影一同成为了讲述故事的载体。设计师还精心设计了水的“容器”，使得水的“肌理”细腻而变化丰富，带来丰富微妙的游赏体验。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Uv_TzshDj6Xe4ElvkRKp5.png?height=1118&width=1698)\n\n   法国农业历史的遗迹通过水景的再设计被融进这座花园,包括蓄水池、喷灌系统和水渠。如水渠、蓄水池和梯田唤起了对当地农业历史的回忆。\n\n  圆形剧场、十字形水渠、消失在远方的天际线、用植物修剪成的拱廊以及所有这些欧洲古典主义园林常用的设计元素，都被古斯塔夫森用艺术化的手法和具有现代感的方式表达了出来。随着游览路线一一呈现在游人眼前，仿佛开启了一扇欧洲古典园林的记忆之门。\n\n    现代西方园林的尺度远远小于传统古典园林，地形限制也更常见。幻想花园空间布局神似而形散，游赏路线依山势而为，并没有古典园林中轴线等的特征，但它清晰的游览序列推进与古典园林营造方法的理性一脉相承；而对景观细节的刻画，与环境氛围的精心营造，形式与气质均取原型自西方古典园林，于细节处完美再现了一幅幅充满古典韵味的西方园林的缩影。\n\n·叙事性 ——

对场地历史背景 、各种分析数据以及政治因素等的表达。通过把故事贯穿于现存的景观之中，使用隐喻式的叙述方法来表现基地的特征和参照体系，使景观不再是单纯的摆设，而是具有日久弥新的风采。”\n\n**“**凯瑟琳**·**斯塔夫森的设计是对场地充满感情的设计，基于**“**设计源于场地**”**的立场，发掘场地特质，力求用作品再现场地的历史，延续场地的文脉。**”**\n\n**“**对于古斯塔夫森来说，景观是通过塑造自然材料来揭示场地特征，并添加新的设计元素，把自然本身的特性和创新完美结合。她讲述了一片土地和在以这片作为基本材料的土地上人类的介入所发生的故事。**”**\n\n                                                                        \n\n### 四、未来展望：新文明，新景观\n\n   综观历史，人们通过塑造环境，来表达或象征某种理念一一力量、秩序、舒适、和谐、愉快、神秘。这些理念经由不同尺度及组合形式，在景观空间中呈现。\n\n  “景观”是在某一特定时期对环境的人为塑造，其形式取决于当时的社会文明，因此，想要完整地理解西方现代园林景观对古典园林的传承与发展，不仅要从历史的角度去分析，还要以哲学、社会发展的观点去认识。\n\n  园林空间的变迁是传承的媒介，外在的形式之下，内在的精神是其变化的源头。 在法国古典主义园林发展时期，花园集建筑、园林、工程、装饰艺术于一体，却仅供少部分人享用。如今它同样是艺术的集合体，但为城市中所有公民共享。园林景观自此具有了更广泛的意义，正式迈向人文主义的景观造园艺术。300年来，法国本土的园林景观记载了这样的演变历程。\n\n  无论是传承还是嬗变，景观空间展现的形态和承载的功能，往往与同时代的社会文化背景相契。 在人们的感知之中，总是会有对他们生活空间的共识，地域性的园林景观便是这种共识产生的重要载体，并伴随着自然的演变和生活的变迁逐渐形成。因此设计不仅仅源于自然，不仅仅来自“此地”，更立足于“当下的我们”。\n\n**“**设计一个景观就是将身体、心灵和思想与大地及自己相联系。**”**

{"id": "4IcGDRpyw1lqh-nuSme9bCnrInSpcdZOZ3pRPwk8qaw", "title": "STARS Token Distribution", "body": "Stargaze is one of the first NFT markets to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Cosmos is a network of custom interoperable blockchains. It is currently the second largest ecosystem by volume, and includes Terra, Cosmos Hub, Thorchain, and Osmosis.\n\nStargaze aims to be a decentralized NFT market, totally owned and governed by its users. Therefore, distribution of STARS has to be equitable, accessible, and cover a large surface area.\n\n## Token Release Schedule\n\nA fair initial distribution is pivotal in setting the future direction of a network. Paired with a thoughtful inflationary release schedule, a network can optimize its token distribution.\n\nThe distribution of STARS is designed to front-load inflation in order to bootstrap the network. This is a similar issuance schedule to Bitcoin. However, instead of halvings, issuance will be cut by 1/3 each year (by multiplying the current issuance by a reduction factor of 67%). Osmosis was the first protocol to use a [“thirding” token release schedule](https://medium.com/osmosis/osmo-token-distribution-ae27ea2bb4db) and heavily inspired Stargaze’s design.\n\nFor some background on using token incentives to bootstrap new networks, check out this great [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619?s=20) by Chris Dixon.\n\n![\"Thirding\" release schedule](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TwRgLvwwmYuxQ8c4BqR3f.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nStargaze will start with an initial supply of 1 billion STARS. An additional 1 billion STARS will be issued the first year. With this \"thirding\" schedule, the issuance for the following year will be 670M STARS. This leads to an **asymptotic max supply of 4 billion STARS**.\n\n![Max supply formula](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yp-aVB78wOm2aurEyzDu1.png?height=206&width=938)\n\n![Issuance calculations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ooIF-U44MYirt21oEg4LL.png?height=1542&width=1630)\n\nStargaze starts off decentralized on day one with a genesis supply that distributes the majority of the tokens to community members. The Foundation will hold a strategic reserve of tokens, and will drive adoption of the protocol by delegating to validators, onboarding creators, and providing grants for ecosystem development.\n\n![Community-focused genesis supply](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZTtjhTqZNqm1rNESQq8j2.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter 5 years, the initial distribution is only 27.6% of the entire token supply. This issuance schedule allows Stargaze to grow and adapt its ownership to new creators, curators, validators, delegators, and other stakeholders.\n\n![Genesis supply vs. new issuance after 5 years](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k_VH9Rk86klZ7IXo2ZbKC.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\n## Airdrop\n\nThe goal of the Stargaze airdrop is to reach the most active participants in the Cosmos ecosystem. Stakers and liquidity providers are more likely to be more active than just token holders. Therefore, Stargaze is doing its airdrop to a mix of network participants:\n\n* **ATOM stakers**\n* **OSMO stakers or liquidity providers**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Cosmos Hub**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Osmosis**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Regen Network**\n\nFor each role above, you will be able to claim **1,998 STARS**. Distributing a fixed amount is in the spirit of the original Uniswap airdrop, giving every user more or less an equal starting point. In order to claim your airdrop, you have to perform 4-5 actions on Stargaze when it launches. If you have used [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) or [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), you’re already familiar with performing tasks to claim tokens. Some claimable actions include bidding on NFTs, staking, and voting in governance.\n\nSome minimums were put in place to prevent dust accounts and those attempting to game airdrops:\n\n* **ATOM staker: 5 ATOM minimum staked**\n* **OSMO staker: 50 OSMO minimum staked**\n\nFurthermore, delegations to centralized exchange validators were excluded.\n\nFor example, if you’re an ATOM staker and OSMO LP, and meet the above minimums, then your airdrop reward is 3,996 STARS.\n\nOsmosis liquidity providers get the airdrop regardless if LP tokens are bonded or not.\n\nAirdrop claimable amounts start decaying 4 months after the launch of the NFT market. The decaying process linearly decreases the claimable amount for another 4 months.\n\n![Airdrop must be claimed to prevent decay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3_QgqhG1LETOtyBdL0a7P.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter the airdrop claim period, unclaimed STARS are sent to the Community Pool.\n\nSnapshots were taken on Oct 11th, 2021 from Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and Regen Network.\n\nTo see how much STARS you’re eligible to claim, please visit <https://stargaze.zone/airdrop>.\n\n***Note: Airdrops won’t be claimable until after Phase 3 of launch. Please see Phase 3 below.***\n\nhttp://stargaze.zone/airdrop\n\n## Reward Distribution\n\nNew token reward distribution will be optimized to facilitate the operations of the NFT market.\n\nThe initial breakdown per block will be:\n\n![Per block distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UzjJ1v4qZ-bF5zw1BY9kr.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAll chain parameters can be changed via governance vote. Everything suggested in this post are sensible defaults. We expect governance to adapt and change the protocol as it matures.\n\n### NFT Incentives\n\n45% of block rewards are set aside for NFT bidding and staking incentives. Token holders will be able to earn yield by bidding and staking on NFTs for certain periods of time. An upcoming post will outline this mechanic in detail.\n\nIf governance determines that NFT incentives are too high for achieving the desired effect of the protocol, they may direct these incentives towards the Community Pool where they can be spent later.\n\n### Staking Rewards\n\nAs per the course with proof-of-stake networks, validators (node operators) earn rewards for securing the network. They also accept delegations from token holders, and charge a commission of 5% or greater for providing the service.\n\nNearly 100 validators were selected to join mainnet after 3 testnets, 2 of which were incentivized. They will earn 35% of all block rewards.\n\n### Developer Rewards\n\nInitially, 15% of block rewards will go to fund the team that contributes to the development of Stargaze. Each account gets a specific weight set by governance. When a developer is no longer contributing, governance can choose to modify their weight or remove their allocation.\n\n### Community Pool\n\nThe Community Pool is the main DAO that operates the network. It is responsible for voting on parameter changes, software upgrades, community matters, and more. It will receive 5% of all block rewards.\n\n## Phased Launch\n\nSince Stargaze is a layer 1 blockchain with many moving parts, it will launch in phases.\n\n* **Phase 0: Chain launch with 0% inflation (Oct 29th)**\n* **Phase 1: Liquidity pools on [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and [Gravity DEX](https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/)**\n* **Phase 2: Governance proposal to enable inflation**\n* **Phase 3: Web app launch with first NFT drop**\n\nMore details about the liquidity pools will be forthcoming. Please follow us on social media (links below) for updates. They are planned for 2-3 weeks after Phase 0, and have to go through governance to be funded via the Community Pool.\n\nNew tokens won’t be issued until after Phase 2, when inflation kicks in. At this time you’ll be able to stake STARS at [stargaze.zone](http://stargaze.zone/) via [Keplr Wallet](http://keplr.app/).\n\nPhase 3 is expected to be completed before the end of the year. Airdrops will be claimable starting in this phase.\n\n## Follow Us\n\nTo follow along with Stargaze developments, check us out on Twitter at <https://twitter.com/StargazeZone>, and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StargazeZone\n\n[https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE)\n\nHappy Stargazing ✨🔭", "timestamp": 1635194430, "digest": "h9Bc7jODUrYB1Jw4mve3QEGVkBwBsyVebN6NP7tRl_Y", "contributor": "0x57a9Cb03cC8Ed919162d9024710ca9E886346299"}
{"id": "mBTxTKsRpgZ0qnICE_xnQBN9aHmcq1GRfYvMjjTeOFM", "title": "How to Join the BEN Meta-Delegate", "body": "### Introduction\n\nThe BEN Meta-Delegate is an initiative to enable students from any and all universities to participate in decentralized governance. During our meta-delegate meetings, students from around the globe come together to present, discuss, and debate new and existing proposals for various blockchain projects. Afterwards, students from every university in our network get to vote on the proposal, and the BEN meta-delegate casts its official vote in the direction of the majority. This way, BEN can bring representation and engagement from smaller universities who may not have the time, experience, or resources to operate their own delegates.\n\nTo join the BEN Meta-Delegate and start discussing/voting on proposals, first let’s go over some relevant concepts.\n\n### What is a DAO?\n\nDAOs have  gradually permeated into mainstream consciousness, offering a sneak peak at what could potentially be the future of entity formation. Yet, the idea of a decentralized autonomous organization remains obscure for most. So what exactly is a DAO?\n\nBy general definition, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a leaderless entity that is operated and managed by a set of rules encoded on smart contracts. Unlike traditional organizations, where decisions are made from the top-down, DAOs have literally flipped this concept on its head where any, all, or most decisions are made by the community, usually token holders of a particular project, which are then voted upon and executed on the blockchain. \n\n### What are Delegates?\n\nAs [eloquently stated](https://a16z.com/2021/08/26/open-sourcing-our-token-delegate-program/) by A16z’s Jeff Amico, “delegation refers to the process where a token holder transfers their on-chain governance rights to others.” He further extends this definition mentioning,  “...delegation is a way to expand the set of participants who have a meaningful say in the governance process.” This said, once token holders have transferred their on-chain governance rights to a particular individual or entity, the recipient is recognized as a delegate. This delegate is entrusted with the responsibility to vote on behalf of the token holders on any & all active governance proposals. \n\nHere are some popular governance portals used in DeFi governance: \n\n* [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/)\n* [Sybil](https://sybil.org/#/delegates/uniswap)\n* [Tally](https://www.withtally.com/)\n\n### How Does BEN’s Meta-Delegate Work?\n\nSince the deployment of the Uniswap Meta-Delegate, we’ve been able to scale our governance efforts to Aave, Compound, Gitcoin, and Ampleforth! As we continue to grow, our vision remains the same: to decentralize and democratize DeFi governance power into the hands of the young people across the world.\n\n**BEN Meta-Delegate Process**\n\n1. Anytime a new proposal is created for any of the projects BEN runs a meta-delegate for, it is posted in the BEN Meta-Delegate channel for discussion and feedback.\n2. After discussions and calls about the proposal, an internal poll is run where every student gets one vote.\n3. For some proposals, a $BEN-weighted poll for the proposal will also be conducted at the same time through [BEN’s Snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/bendao.eth).\n4. Once the internal voting period closes, the student-weighted vote and, if applicable, the $BEN-weighted vote, are averaged out to calculate the end voting result. This way, the BEN community can participate in voting, while also enabling any student to have a voice in governance without needing to purchase large amounts of tokens.\n5. The BEN Meta-Delegate, with voting power delegated from our treasury, alumni, partners, and supporters, will vote in the direction of the end result.\n\n### How To Join BEN’s Meta-Delegate\n\nGetting involved in governance has never been easier!

{"id": "620h4G0kLCaHd5MiiI9_ZAVSP2JpRSBcLHkLheyaf7Y", "title": "A Simple Metric to Identify Bitcoin Tops - Capriole - Medium", "body": "## Introducing: Supply Delta\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*szSG9uMWfq-PTWWBO33epA.png)\n\nSupply Delta\n\nIdentifying how strong and weak hands accumulate and distribute their Bitcoin provides a good leading indicator for identifying price tops and risk regions.\n\nIn this article we introduce a simple metric “Supply Delta” which helps highlight when risk of a price top is locally high and may warrant tighter risk management. Supply Delta is also useful at highlighting accumulation zones.\n\n## Short- and Long-Term Holder Supply\n\nIn 2020, Glassnode [introduced an approach](https://insights.glassnode.com/sth-lth-sopr-mvrv/) to classifying short- and long-term holders into two distinct categories based on coin movement age.\n\nRafael and the team found that once a coin was held for 155 days, it had a significantly higher probability of being held for the long-term, and therefore can be considered “long-term holder supply”.

Supply Delta is also useful at highlighting accumulation zones.\n\n## Short- and Long-Term Holder Supply\n\nIn 2020, Glassnode [introduced an approach](https://insights.glassnode.com/sth-lth-sopr-mvrv/) to classifying short- and long-term holders into two distinct categories based on coin movement age.\n\nRafael and the team found that once a coin was held for 155 days, it had a significantly higher probability of being held for the long-term, and therefore can be considered “long-term holder supply”. Conversely, Short-Term holder supply represents all other off exchange balances with coin age less than 155 days.\n\nPlotting supply held by short- and long-term holders provides a good visual representation of how supply is accumulated and distributed as price cycles develop.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*LeRbSm6jY4ih8GLtFfPl4Q.png)\n\nSupply classification shows how short-term holders buy into price appreciation, whereas long-term holders sell into strength.\n\nLong-term holders show greater investment sophistication — increasing their holdings during bear markets, and reducing their holdings as price makes new all-time highs.

{"id": "EM2lIWr6A0d1TmMhWL6Y7-B6jFTmFROIlBCAEoVP6Ms", "title": "STARS Token Distribution", "body": "Stargaze is one of the first NFT markets to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Cosmos is a network of custom interoperable blockchains. It is currently the second largest ecosystem by volume, and includes Terra, Cosmos Hub, Thorchain, and Osmosis.\n\nStargaze aims to be a decentralized NFT market, totally owned and governed by its users. Therefore, distribution of STARS has to be equitable, accessible, and cover a large surface area.\n\n## Token Release Schedule\n\nA fair initial distribution is pivotal in setting the future direction of a network. Paired with a thoughtful inflationary release schedule, a network can optimize its token distribution.\n\nThe distribution of STARS is designed to front-load inflation in order to bootstrap the network. This is a similar issuance schedule to Bitcoin. However, instead of halvings, issuance will be cut by 1/3 each year (by multiplying the current issuance by a reduction factor of 67%). Osmosis was the first protocol to use a [“thirding” token release schedule](https://medium.com/osmosis/osmo-token-distribution-ae27ea2bb4db) and heavily inspired Stargaze’s design.\n\nFor some background on using token incentives to bootstrap new networks, check out this great [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619?s=20) by Chris Dixon.\n\n![\"Thirding\" release schedule](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TwRgLvwwmYuxQ8c4BqR3f.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nStargaze will start with an initial supply of 1 billion STARS. An additional 1 billion STARS will be issued the first year. With this \"thirding\" schedule, the issuance for the following year will be 670M STARS. This leads to an **asymptotic max supply of 4 billion STARS**.\n\n![Total supply formula](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2uF4grpV69kKOYbiPDtUb.png?height=168&width=966)\n\n![Issuance calculations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ooIF-U44MYirt21oEg4LL.png?height=1542&width=1630)\n\nStargaze starts off decentralized on day one with a genesis supply that distributes the majority of the tokens to community members. The Foundation will hold a strategic reserve of tokens, and will drive adoption of the protocol by delegating to validators, onboarding creators, and providing grants for ecosystem development.\n\n![Community-focused genesis supply](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZTtjhTqZNqm1rNESQq8j2.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter 5 years, the initial distribution is only 27.6% of the entire token supply. This issuance schedule allows Stargaze to grow and adapt its ownership to new creators, curators, validators, delegators, and other stakeholders.\n\n![Genesis supply vs. new issuance after 5 years](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k_VH9Rk86klZ7IXo2ZbKC.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\n## Airdrop\n\nThe goal of the Stargaze airdrop is to reach the most active participants in the Cosmos ecosystem. Stakers and liquidity providers are more likely to be more active than just token holders. Therefore, Stargaze is doing its airdrop to a mix of network participants:\n\n* **ATOM stakers**\n* **OSMO stakers or liquidity providers**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Cosmos Hub**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Osmosis**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Regen Network**\n\nFor each role above, you will be able to claim **1,998 STARS**. Distributing a fixed amount is in the spirit of the original Uniswap airdrop, giving every user more or less an equal starting point. In order to claim your airdrop, you have to perform 4-5 actions on Stargaze when it launches. If you have used [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) or [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), you’re already familiar with performing tasks to claim tokens. Some claimable actions include bidding on NFTs, staking, and voting in governance.\n\nSome minimums were put in place to prevent dust accounts and those attempting to game airdrops:\n\n* **ATOM staker: 5 ATOM minimum staked**\n* **OSMO staker: 50 OSMO minimum staked**\n\nFurthermore, delegations to centralized exchange validators were excluded.\n\nFor example, if you’re an ATOM staker and OSMO LP, and meet the above minimums, then your airdrop reward is 3,996 STARS.\n\nOsmosis liquidity providers get the airdrop regardless if LP tokens are bonded or not.\n\nAirdrop claimable amounts start decaying 4 months after the launch of the NFT market. The decaying process linearly decreases the claimable amount for another 4 months.\n\n![Airdrop must be claimed to prevent decay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3_QgqhG1LETOtyBdL0a7P.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter the airdrop claim period, unclaimed STARS are sent to the Community Pool.\n\nSnapshots were taken on Oct 11th, 2021 from Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and Regen Network.\n\nTo see how much STARS you’re eligible to claim, please visit <https://stargaze.zone/airdrop>.\n\n***Note: Airdrops won’t be claimable until after Phase 3 of launch. Please see Phase 3 below.***\n\nhttp://stargaze.zone/airdrop\n\n## Reward Distribution\n\nNew token reward distribution will be optimized to facilitate the operations of the NFT market.\n\nThe initial breakdown per block will be:\n\n![Per block distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UzjJ1v4qZ-bF5zw1BY9kr.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAll chain parameters can be changed via governance vote. Everything suggested in this post are sensible defaults. We expect governance to adapt and change the protocol as it matures.\n\n### NFT Incentives\n\n45% of block rewards are set aside for NFT bidding and staking incentives. Token holders will be able to earn yield by bidding and staking on NFTs for certain periods of time. An upcoming post will outline this mechanic in detail.\n\nIf governance determines that NFT incentives are too high for achieving the desired effect of the protocol, they may direct these incentives towards the Community Pool where they can be spent later.\n\n### Staking Rewards\n\nAs per the course with proof-of-stake networks, validators (node operators) earn rewards for securing the network. They also accept delegations from token holders, and charge a commission of 5% or greater for providing the service.\n\nNearly 100 validators were selected to join mainnet after 3 testnets, 2 of which were incentivized. They will earn 35% of all block rewards.\n\n### Developer Rewards\n\nInitially, 15% of block rewards will go to fund the team that contributes to the development of Stargaze. Each account gets a specific weight set by governance. When a developer is no longer contributing, governance can choose to modify their weight or remove their allocation.\n\n### Community Pool\n\nThe Community Pool is the main DAO that operates the network. It is responsible for voting on parameter changes, software upgrades, community matters, and more. It will receive 5% of all block rewards.\n\n## Phased Launch\n\nSince Stargaze is a layer 1 blockchain with many moving parts, it will launch in phases.\n\n* **Phase 0: Chain launch with 0% inflation (Oct 29th)**\n* **Phase 1: Liquidity pools on [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and [Gravity DEX](https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/)**\n* **Phase 2: Governance proposal to enable inflation**\n* **Phase 3: Web app launch with first NFT drop**\n\nMore details about the liquidity pools will be forthcoming. Please follow us on social media (links below) for updates. They are planned for 2-3 weeks after Phase 0, and have to go through governance to be funded via the Community Pool.\n\nNew tokens won’t be issued until after Phase 2, when inflation kicks in. At this time you’ll be able to stake STARS at [stargaze.zone](http://stargaze.zone/) via [Keplr Wallet](http://keplr.app/).\n\nPhase 3 is expected to be completed before the end of the year. Airdrops will be claimable starting in this phase.\n\n## Follow Us\n\nTo follow along with Stargaze developments, check us out on Twitter at <https://twitter.com/StargazeZone>, and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StargazeZone\n\n[https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE)\n\nHappy Stargazing ✨🔭", "timestamp": 1635194938, "digest": "h9Bc7jODUrYB1Jw4mve3QEGVkBwBsyVebN6NP7tRl_Y", "contributor": "0x57a9Cb03cC8Ed919162d9024710ca9E886346299"}

This issuance schedule allows Stargaze to grow and adapt its ownership to new creators, curators, validators, delegators, and other stakeholders.\n\n![Genesis supply vs. new issuance after 5 years](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k_VH9Rk86klZ7IXo2ZbKC.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\n## Airdrop\n\nThe goal of the Stargaze airdrop is to reach the most active participants in the Cosmos ecosystem. Stakers and liquidity providers are more likely to be more active than just token holders. Therefore, Stargaze is doing its airdrop to a mix of network participants:\n\n* **ATOM stakers**\n* **OSMO stakers or liquidity providers**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Cosmos Hub**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Osmosis**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Regen Network**\n\nFor each role above, you will be able to claim **1,998 STARS**. Distributing a fixed amount is in the spirit of the original Uniswap airdrop, giving every user more or less an equal starting point. In order to claim your airdrop, you have to perform 4-5 actions on Stargaze when it launches. If you have used [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) or [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), you’re already familiar with performing tasks to claim tokens. Some claimable actions include bidding on NFTs, staking, and voting in governance.\n\nSome minimums were put in place to prevent dust accounts and those attempting to game airdrops:\n\n* **ATOM staker: 5 ATOM minimum staked**\n* **OSMO staker: 50 OSMO minimum staked**\n\nFurthermore, delegations to centralized exchange validators were excluded.\n\nFor example, if you’re an ATOM staker and OSMO LP, and meet the above minimums, then your airdrop reward is 3,996 STARS.\n\nOsmosis liquidity providers get the airdrop regardless if LP tokens are bonded or not.\n\nAirdrop claimable amounts start decaying 4 months after the launch of the NFT market. The decaying process linearly decreases the claimable amount for another 4 months.\n\n![Airdrop must be claimed to prevent decay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3_QgqhG1LETOtyBdL0a7P.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter the airdrop claim period, unclaimed STARS are sent to the Community Pool.\n\nSnapshots were taken on Oct 11th, 2021 from Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and Regen Network.\n\nTo see how much STARS you’re eligible to claim, please visit <https://stargaze.zone/airdrop>.\n\n***Note: Airdrops won’t be claimable until after Phase 3 of launch. Please see Phase 3 below.***\n\nhttp://stargaze.zone/airdrop\n\n## Reward Distribution\n\nNew token reward distribution will be optimized to facilitate the operations of the NFT market.\n\nThe initial breakdown per block will be:\n\n![Per block distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UzjJ1v4qZ-bF5zw1BY9kr.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAll chain parameters can be changed via governance vote. Everything suggested in this post are sensible defaults. We expect governance to adapt and change the protocol as it matures.\n\n### NFT Incentives\n\n45% of block rewards are set aside for NFT bidding and staking incentives. Token holders will be able to earn yield by bidding and staking on NFTs for certain periods of time. An upcoming post will outline this mechanic in detail.\n\nIf governance determines that NFT incentives are too high for achieving the desired effect of the protocol, they may direct these incentives towards the Community Pool where they can be spent later.\n\n### Staking Rewards\n\nAs per the course with proof-of-stake networks, validators (node operators) earn rewards for securing the network. They also accept delegations from token holders, and charge a commission of 5% or greater for providing the service.\n\nNearly 100 validators were selected to join mainnet after 3 testnets, 2 of which were incentivized. They will earn 35% of all block rewards.\n\n### Developer Rewards\n\nInitially, 15% of block rewards will go to fund the team that contributes to the development of Stargaze. Each account gets a specific weight set by governance. When a developer is no longer contributing, governance can choose to modify their weight or remove their allocation.\n\n### Community Pool\n\nThe Community Pool is the main DAO that operates the network. It is responsible for voting on parameter changes, software upgrades, community matters, and more. It will receive 5% of all block rewards.\n\n## Phased Launch\n\nSince Stargaze is a layer 1 blockchain with many moving parts, it will launch in phases.\n\n* **Phase 0: Chain launch with 0% inflation (Oct 29th)**\n* **Phase 1: Liquidity pools on [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and [Gravity DEX](https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/)**\n* **Phase 2: Governance proposal to enable inflation**\n* **Phase 3: Web app launch with first NFT drop**\n\nMore details about the liquidity pools will be forthcoming. Please follow us on social media (links below) for updates. They are planned for 2-3 weeks after Phase 0, and have to go through governance to be funded via the Community Pool.\n\nNew tokens won’t be issued until after Phase 2, when inflation kicks in. At this time you’ll be able to stake STARS at [stargaze.zone](http://stargaze.zone/) via [Keplr Wallet](http://keplr.app/).\n\nPhase 3 is expected to be completed before the end of the year. Airdrops will be claimable starting in this phase.\n\n## Follow Us\n\nTo follow along with Stargaze developments, check us out on Twitter at <https://twitter.com/StargazeZone>, and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StargazeZone\n\n[https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE)\n\nHappy Stargazing ✨🔭", "timestamp": 1635194837, "digest": "h9Bc7jODUrYB1Jw4mve3QEGVkBwBsyVebN6NP7tRl_Y", "contributor": "0x57a9Cb03cC8Ed919162d9024710ca9E886346299"}

，阐述总结了古典园林的特点，并结合相关案例，归纳并探讨西方现代园林与古典园林之间的关系。重点从营造手法方面分析与阐述了西方现代园林对古典园林的继承与发展，启迪现代园林的创作与实践。\n\n法国的传统园林都在世界园林史上占据非常重要的地位，深入探讨西方景观园林的营造思想和手法，总结法国古典景观园林的景观特色、造园思想与造园要素，结合法国最优秀现代园林进行对比分析，将有助于解读西方现代园林对古典园林的继承与发展。\n\n### 一、法国古典园林的产生背景与特点\n\n17世纪下半叶，路易十四彻底巩固了国家的统一和封建专制制度，把绝对君权推向顶峰。这一时期是法国科学和哲学兴盛的时代，也是古典主义文艺思潮席卷法国和欧洲的时代。当时的政治制度、美学哲学思想及西方古典主义绘画的特点，都对古典主义造园艺术产生了深远的影响。\n\n**古典园林的造园思想与景观特色**\n\n西方园林营造思想是一种通过控制自然、征服自然来实现自然美的自然美学思想。强调“驾驭自然，改造自然，强迫自然接受均衡的法则”。法国古典园林的景观形态所体现的基本上是一种建筑美，诉诸简明、规则的几何图案，人们常将法国式园林比喻为“绿色建筑”。\n\n古典主义造园家勒诺特尔从法国的国土风貌中提炼出平原、密林、农田、河流等要素，形成几何形的台地、丛林、花坛、运河、水池等要素，并按照对称均衡的原则布置成一个和谐的空间。图案式的丛林、花坛、草坪、水面组成一系列“绿色厅堂”，如同一座巨大的“绿色宫殿”。法国古典园林从凡尔赛到枫丹白露，园林的布局都是几何板块式的，植物也经过经心修剪布置，规矩方正的草坪和水渠，无一不表现出严整规则的秩序感。\n\n### 二、西方古典园林营造原理和造园法则\n\n2\\.1 几何学原理与规则式园林造园法则\n\n规则式园林的要素及空间皆显示出明确的几何形式，所以又称“几何式园林”；它的造园要素形式规整、布置整齐，树木花草修剪整形，还称“整形式园林”；而规模宏大、地势平坦、以模纹花坛著称的法国古典主义园林则被人们称为“平面图案式园林”。纵观法国古典造园历史，基于逻辑与理性的规则式园林正是从几何学中开出的花朵，从现代西方园林中也能看到其永恒的影响。\n\n早在公元前3 000年的古埃及、古印度和古巴比伦时期，就出现了有关几何学的记载。随着几何学的发展，人们对客观事物的认知也在不断加深。几何学的研究对象从图形到体积，从平面到立体，从空间到太空，极大地扩大了西方人的视野和研究领域。几何学研究方法也从运用公理来推论、到论证公理本身、再到公理法体系的建立，此为由“象”入“理”。大大地提高了人们的思维和论证能力，为严谨的合乎理性的园林设计方法的形成打下了坚实的基础。\n\n2\\.2  美学思想与规则式园林造园法则\n\n毕达哥拉斯把“数”看作是一切事物的本质，强调事物的性质是由某种数量关系所决定的，并且万物按照一定的数量比例而构成和谐的秩序，据此提出了“美在和谐”这一著名的美学命题。亚里士多德也说：“数学能促进人们对美的特性——数值、比例、秩序等的认识”，强调数学研究方法对美学研究的作用，认为“美的主要形式是秩序、匀称与明确”，指出井然有序、整体均衡在审美中的重要作用。古典主义美学追求一种绝对的、永恒的“美”的概念，“美产生于尺度和比例”，这正是古典造园师创造“美”的标尺。\n\n总结得出，几何学对古典主义园林的影响主要体现在两个方面：\n\n（1）形成了基于空间的造园要素和布局结构等形式风格。——古典的几何学以图形空间为主要研究对象，本身是一种直观性很强的视觉艺术，促使园林在要素和空间上出现几何形体化倾向。\n\n（2）产生了基于理性的美学思想和创作方法等造园理论。——建立在数学、几何学基础之上的美学原则，把追求简洁、对称、均衡、统一视为核心价值，强调比例、尺度的重要作用。景物、轴线、空间等布局经过深思熟虑，都是理性思维的产物。\n\n2\\.3  几何学原理在实际造园中的具体运用——透视原理的运用\n\n中国绘画与西方绘画具有完全不同的表达方式——西方古典绘画重视写生和描摹，而中国绘画重在写意。因此，西方人发明了焦点透视，来再现真实的自然；东方则利用多重角度的“看”，来达到某种完整的表达。这两种不同的视觉逻辑可被总结为“注视”和“扫视”。\n\n·中国画——平面性——表达空间深度——利用扫视的路径逻辑来推动并作画面的记录\n\n·西方古典主义绘画——透视法 选一个最佳透视点 表达真实三维空间——利用定点欣赏即注视的逻辑来作画面的记录  注重静止的欣赏\n\n因此在西方的造园过程中，重要视点上的画面营造尤为重要——为了在重要视点上创造更加均衡的画面，需要对透视效果加以巧妙的校正。比如古典主义园林规模宏大，随着中轴线的不断延伸，难免出现线条、图形、空间的透视变形问题，必须对极其深远的透视带来的变形加以修正，透视原理被巧妙地用来加强或减弱空间的深远感。\n\n### 三、西方现代园林对古典园林的继承与发展\n\n3\\.1 领土意识的传承与转化——整体性\n\n法国古典主义园林无论面积的大小，都会有与外界环境紧密对话，通过园林中轴线空间无限的延伸，将园林中的自然景观渗透进入城市之中。 整体性的设计理念将各类要素紧密编织进花园的空间结构体系中，并通过相互之间的联系，层层拓展开来。 法国现代园林景观设计深受到这一理念的影响，逐渐形成了领土景观意识。\n\n但要注意的是，在法国古典主义花园中，空间拓展是以花园为主体，以外部环境为辅助。 在当时的时代背景下，花园为掌权者建造，不需要过多的考虑城市的问题或其他人的使用需求。而现代公园的规划设计却需要将思路与意识反转，公园本身要以谦卑的态度融于领土景观。花园作为客体寻求与外部环境的融合，以最好服务市民，是顺应现代城市发展的必然结果。\n\n园林与城市为一体的整体性意识得以传承，但现代园林景观与古典主义园林在空间拓展上完全相反的设计思路，正是随着时代变迁而注定发生的转化。\n\n3\\.2 造园手法的继承与发展\n\n3\\.2.1传承与发展——清晰的空间结构\n\n法国古典园林特点\n\n·轴线的嬗变\n\n法国古典主义园林清晰的空间结构来源于轴线的统领作用，并通过控制地形、 组织视线，来实现空间的集中性和画面感。\n\n·主次对比\n\n法国古典主义园林构图强调分清主次，通过以轴线景观为主体，次要轴线辅助；空间结构上以中心开阔的大空间与周围规则郁闭的小空间对比，通过对称的几何形式强化了空间结构，统率全局。\n\n通过几世纪的演变，法国现代园林与古典主义园林具有根本性的差异。 古典主义园林体现皇权至上的设计理念，决定了其庞大的尺度感与集中式的空间流线。 轴线是园林中最为重要的游览路径与景观视廊，串联所有最精致的设计元素。\n\n而现代园林景观更多地满足公共空间使用的需求，不再是统治者的个人享受，同时尺度也更亲人。轴线成为了更小尺度上的空间控制要素，在一些公园、城市广场中虽仍能分辨出空间布局中轴线的存在，但它们被打散分解，布局更为灵活，消融于景观之中，形成了分散、丰富的空间流线。\n\n3\\.2.2 传承与发展——构图几何与强烈的形式特征\n\n当理解“构图几何”时，不应只是狭隘地拘泥于圆、方等形式语言，应理解到现代园林景观绝不是简单地原样照搬图案花纹样式，而是运用图案式形式语言的整体布局模式，及抽象部分形态要素。与古典主义园林相比，现代园林所体现出的空间形态和构图样式比古典图案式更为简洁、灵活、多变。同时，精准的构图几何关系，则进一步强化清晰空间结构。\n\n雪铁龙公园的整体空间结构就是一个具有强烈个性与创造性的典型。该公园的空间结构严谨规整，两个玻璃温室及中间的喷泉水景，大草坪及草坪南侧的大台阶，白色拱桥共同形成了一条隐晦的中心线。温室高约15m，长45m，成为控制大草坪的重要建筑元素。温室之间的喷泉整体倾斜向大草坪，进一步增强了空间的关联性和中心线的整体趋势。公园的中心大草坪长约300m，宽约100m，以极小的倾斜坡度整体趋向于塞纳河岸，两侧的植物、 构筑物和方形的高篱以对称的形式语言强化了轴线的结构，自然的河流成为轴线的结点。\n\n3\\.3 传承与发展——造园要素的现代演绎\n\n法国古典园林图案语言在法国古典主义园林中，简洁的几何形体是最主要的形式语言。形式语言极强的造园要素，按照理性逻辑精心排列在公园中，形成一帧帧清晰精致的景观。这一章节将具体解构巴黎雪铁龙公园，并分析幻想花园的景观序列，揭示西方现代公园是怎样提取古典园林中的造园要素，抽象并恰到好处的运用在设计中。\n\n3\\.3.1 植物要素\n\n法国园林的理论基础来自建筑学，树木的规则式种植、几何形修剪，正是为了构成“绿色建筑”的规则造型。单一植物品种丛植能使整个群落在形状、色彩、季相变化、生长速度等方便保持一致，从而保证“绿色建筑”的稳定性。平坦的草坪不仅有利于烘托各“绿色建筑”群的鲜明轮廓，其本身也是“绿色广场”。运用植物要素的相互组合分隔空间，同时营造宁静、典雅的花园气氛。\n\n3\\.3.2 建筑要素\n\n雕塑作为建筑艺术的附属品，一直在法国园林中占有非常重要的地位。它不仅用于装饰花园中的住宅，还常与喷泉组合或是独立地布置在花园中，形成局部景点的构图中心。\n\n3\\.3.3 水要素\n\n法国古典园林中的水体大多应用法国平原上常见的湖泊、河流的形式，各种水体都呈方、园、八角形等规则的几何形状。处理手法主要有水渠、喷泉、壕沟、运河。法国园林多用静水，面积大，以气魄与宁静取胜，形成典雅、从容的风格。又称“水镜”。水镜往往都在透视和投影关系上仔细推敲过，以保证主体建筑在视角范围内完整地倒映水中。喷泉主要布置在轴线上或园路的交点上，这是法国园林中重要的造景要素之一。\n\n**案例1 雪铁龙公园**\n\n![雪铁龙公园平面图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PuruyWq6SJ9wlFXDuTH29.png?height=1140&width=1896)\n\n·法国古典园林模纹花坛——中心大草坪\n\n刺绣花坛起源于法国古典主义园林，刺绣花坛有清晰的、简洁的边界，在矩形、方形、圆形等形体内部来实现变化丰富的花坛样式，强化艺术的震撼力。大面积的草坪为频繁运用的表现手法。\n\n雪铁龙公园中心的大草坪被设计者命名为\"parterre vert”——绿色花坛之意，是对法国古典园林中草坪花坛的继承，它是整个设计的“核”。四周被方正的水渠围绕，与周边丰富多样的小空间形成了鲜明的对比。\n\n·丛林园——七个小花园\n\n丛林园在意大利文艺复兴时期就开始在园林中使用。在法国古典主义园林中，丛林园常常位于中心开阔空间的周边地区，尺度小，林荫茂密，被限定在规整的方格网形式布局之中。丛林园内部是自由多样的构图形式，在每一个区域内部都分为不同的私密空间和舒适尺度。\n\n与此对应的是温室旁的一系列小花园。中心草坪一侧的七块狭长场地结合地形，形成七个立体、半封闭的花园。这些以植物种植为主的花园各有主题。\n\n金色园、红色园、白色园、橙色园、绿色园、蓝色园，以及“运动之园”这七个部分组成的系列空间的设计概念来自一周中的七天。设计师用色彩带给人的情感联想来诠释日常生活中人们每一天的情绪变化。并通过不同植物种类——乔木、灌木的叶色和质感以及草本植物的花色和小品、地面材质的对比以突出个性与特征。\n\n·古典园林建筑——高大树篱\n\n在园林营造中，经常把园林植物充当建筑材料来使用。经过修剪的造型植物通常与建筑物或者构筑物相配合， 起到界定空间的作用。 高大的乔木经过整形修剪会在空间中形成边角硬朗的体块， 其高大的尺度甚至超过人工的建筑。\n\n水渠旁边修剪的高大树篱，限定中央大草坪的空间，并作为进入周围一系列小花园的过渡。提供了竖向的围合，丰富了天际线。\n\n·古典园林柱厅回廊——柱状树阵\n\n西方建筑以石结构为主流，西方建筑最重要的风格特征为柱式，以古希腊建筑的3种柱式（多利克式、艾奥尼亚式、科林斯式）为典型。\n\n法国园林中，从植的植物群体或园艺群落往往由单一的或有限的几种植物构成；被修剪成几何形体，按照规则式或行列式种植。规则式的植物景观具有庄严、肃穆的气氛，给人以雄伟的气魄感。\n\n雪铁龙公园中，修剪成柱状的树阵暗示法国古典园林的柱厅回廊，一定程度上限定中心草坪空间。\n\n·自然边界——野生散植花卉\n\n植物不再是供人赏玩的对象， 而是生态过程中与人平等的要素，在城市之中营造第一自然。具有东方园林的意味。\n\n**案例2 西方古典园林中水的塑造——幻想花园**\n\n幻想花园位于法国里昂和波尔多之间的泰拉松市。泰拉松镇面积不大，是一个有着悠久历史的老城市，Vezere河流经城市，幻想花园就位于河边的山坡上。幻想花园是一个东西长，南北窄的长条形花园，全园共有13个主题景点。凯瑟琳·古斯塔夫森为这个花园设计了一条环形路线，全部景点由这一条环全园的道路一一串起。主入口位于地块的最低点。\n\n古斯塔夫森的设计有着明确的方向性，精心布置在花园中的水渠、风向标以及漂浮在林间的金色铝带明确地引导着视线，使得幻想花园的结构骨骼清晰。花架绿廊引导着人们进入花园深处，林中的金色飘带吸引人们走进森林，道路的转角处常常设有喷泉引导视线。除了具体的景观构筑物，更多推动人们向前的是看不见的景观元素：潺潺的流水声、玫瑰的香气、明亮的草坪。结构上的方向性是从一系列清晰展开的游览序列展开，其中，水作为最重要的线索贯穿于整个花园之中。\n\n![幻想花园平面图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sdeD1jX5nqpv6kn5Nop2w.jpg?height=566&width=860)\n\n一条小路从小城向上延伸到花园大门,伴随着一条与之相平行的细水渠。沿着林地小路,浓密的黄杨木林里隐藏着几条水梯,晶莹的水流飞跃而下。\n\n转角处草地中有两条细细的喷泉，作为水花园的前奏。进入流水园，高潮迭起：花园中几乎有着水的所有形式。流水园内部组织成传统的十字形结构,。这个水的空间被柳树和灌木丛环绕着,地面由石板铺砌,上面随意分布着若干喷水口。\n\n水花园的十字渠充满了欧洲古典花园的味道，其中东西向的水渠向东一直延伸，渐渐高出地面，随地形有几个跌落的台阶，直直地指向远处的山峦和无尽的天边。\n\n南北向的水渠则向南如瀑布般跌落入下面一个平静宽阔的池塘。池塘里,有多个随意安置的喷水装置。喷射出的水雾反射着阳光,水池边种着美丽的鸢尾，在水雾中形成宁静的气氛。\n\n从水花园出来，进入到喷泉小路，齐肩篱开出多个洞口，水从小方水池叠砌的花岗岩石块流下，顺石板的缝隙流入路边的暗沟。\n\n最后一个水景点是河流，在石子小路的路边安放有5组石板，每块石板上面刻有世界上主要的河流三角洲的平面图。水从三角洲的切口处流出，顺着带有凹槽的石板横跨过石子铺就的道路，再顺着山坡层层跌落黄杨篱边的道路。这五组水流象征了五大洲的河流。“五大洲河流”的水在流到黄杨树篱边的道路后，经过暗管回流向入口引道处的水渠。\n\n幻想花园的设计中，水串联了各个重要景观要素的作用。引导了整个花园游览的行进序列。水流的路径可以被看作是对水的应用的进步\\*\\*,\\*\\*从用于灌溉到作为赏心悦目的装饰，融入场地与园林的历史。无论是倾泻而下的瀑布、潺潺的小溪，还是安静的水渠、梦幻的水雾，动水、静水和倒影一同成为了讲述故事的载体。设计师还精心设计了水的“容器”，使得水的“肌理”细腻而变化丰富，带来丰富微妙的游赏体验。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Uv_TzshDj6Xe4ElvkRKp5.png?height=1118&width=1698)\n\n法国农业历史的遗迹通过水景的再设计被融进这座花园,包括蓄水池、喷灌系统和水渠。如水渠、蓄水池和梯田唤起了对当地农业历史的回忆。\n\n圆形剧场、十字形水渠、消失在远方的天际线、用植物修剪成的拱廊以及所有这些欧洲古典主义园林常用的设计元素，都被古斯塔夫森用艺术化的手法和具有现代感的方式表达了出来。随着游览路线一一呈现在游人眼前，仿佛开启了一扇欧洲古典园林的记忆之门。\n\n现代西方园林的尺度远远小于传统古典园林，地形限制也更常见。幻想花园空间布局神似而形散，游赏路线依山势而为，并没有古典园林中轴线等的特征，但它清晰的游览序列推进与古典园林营造方法的理性一脉相承；而对景观细节的刻画，与环境氛围的精心营造，形式与气质均取原型自西方古典园林，于细节处完美再现了一幅幅充满古典韵味的西方园林的缩影。\n\n·叙事性 —— 间接表述传承古典园林艺术\n\n\\*\\*“\\*\\*间接表述是一种对艺术的诠释 **,** 对场地历史背景 、各种分析数据以及政治因素等的表达。通过把故事贯穿于现存的景观之中，使用隐喻式的叙述方法来表现基地的特征和参照体系，使景观不再是单纯的摆设，而是具有日久弥新的风采。”\n\n**“凯瑟琳**·**斯塔夫森的设计是对场地充满感情的设计，基于**“**设计源于场地**”**的立场，发掘场地特质，力求用作品再现场地的历史，延续场地的文脉。**”\n\n**“对于古斯塔夫森来说，景观是通过塑造自然材料来揭示场地特征，并添加新的设计元素，把自然本身的特性和创新完美结合。她讲述了一片土地和在以这片作为基本材料的土地上人类的介入所发生的故事。**”\n\n### 四、未来展望：新文明，新景观\n\n综观历史，人们通过塑造环境，来表达或象征某种理念一一力量、秩序、舒适、和谐、愉快、神秘。这些理念经由不同尺度及组合形式，在景观空间中呈现。\n\n“景观”是在某一特定时期对环境的人为塑造，其形式取决于当时的社会文明，因此，想要完整地理解西方现代园林景观对古典园林的传承与发展，不仅要从历史的角度去分析，还要以哲学、社会发展的观点去认识。\n\n园林空间的变迁是传承的媒介，外在的形式之下，内在的精神是其变化的源头。 在法国古典主义园林发展时期，花园集建筑、园林、工程、装饰艺术于一体，却仅供少部分人享用。如今它同样是艺术的集合体，但为城市中所有公民共享。园林景观自此具有了更广泛的意义，正式迈向人文主义的景观造园艺术。300年来，法国本土的园林景观记载了这样的演变历程。\n\n无论是传承还是嬗变，景观空间展现的形态和承载的功能，往往与同时代的社会文化背景相契。 在人们的感知之中，总是会有对他们生活空间的共识，地域性的园林景观便是这种共识产生的重要载体，并伴随着自然的演变和生活的变迁逐渐形成。因此设计不仅仅源于自然，不仅仅来自“此地”，更立足于“当下的我们”。\n\n**“设计一个景观就是将身体、心灵和思想与大地及自己相联系。**”\n**“天空是属于我的。**”\n\n参考文献\n\n\\[1\\]刘滨谊  现代景观规划设计\\[M\\].南京:东南大学出版社,1999\n\n\\[2\\]王向荣 林菁   西方现代景观设计的理论与实践  \\[M\\]中国建筑工业出版社\n\n\\[3\\]张泽乾  法国文化史\\[M\\].武汉:长江文艺出版社,1997\n\n\\[4\\]张凡   法国城市历史地段景观创造与城市设计\\[J\\].时代建筑,2002(1):23-25\n\n\\[5\\]王贵祥  中西文化自然观比较\\[J\\].重庆建筑,2002(l):51-52\n\n\\[6\\]周武忠  中西古典园林艺术风格比较\\[J\\].东南大学学报,2003(11):

{"id": "VL4MH0y-3lSpH3C9lGVrpiSHR7ceTK9nEge96nkW-Dk", "title": "solarpunks join DAOs", "body": "Solarpunk intrigues web3 culture and more and more we see its imagery and language appear across the culture. But what exactly is solarpunk and why would it apply to web3? This project, “solarpunk web3,” is an attempt to answer these two questions.\n\n \n\nIn its current sense, solarpunk is a social imaginary. It presents an optimistic future where we have learnt to balance our technological prowess with a respect for the natural world. It is often conceived as a genre of literary fiction, specifically science fiction, but like all good fiction, it contains an underlying set of concepts and theories. While there currently exists some isolated academic work that attempts to these synthesise solarpunk ideas, they are sporadic. “solarpunk web3” will perform this synthesis and then extend the solarpunk medium into the web3 space.\n\n \n\n**Who?** solarpunklabs is a nym of Dr. Paul Dylan-Ennis. I am a Lecturer in the College of Business, University College Dublin and focus on Ethereum’s social and political culture.\n\n \n \n\nYou can see my academic profile here: <https://people.ucd.ie/paul.ennis>\n\nAnd here for my publications:\n\n<https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9882-6534>\n\nI also contribute to CoinDesk and other media outlets as well: <https://muckrack.com/paul-dylan-ennis>\n\nI very occasionally contribute to the Ethereum.org repo: <https://github.com/solarpunklabs>\n\n \n\nMost importantly, I’m just a web3 enthusiast who likes DAOs, DeFi, social tokens, NFTs, and crypto history and lore. Quite a few of you will know me from Discord or Twitter where I’m usually in and around the social token space.  \n\n \n\n**What?** The mission of “solarpunk web3” is to create a set of resources introducing web3 natives to the rich history of solarpunk theory and fiction and then extending out into solarpunk/web3 crossovers.\n\n \n\nI have three goals in mind:\n\n \n\n(1) To produce a broad general introduction to solarpunk theory and fiction, with reference to web3 applications. This introduction could then be dropped to any newcomer who is curious about solarpunk and web3. Right now, the sources are not just scattered, but obscure. I’ll use my research chops to fix that.\n\n \n \n\n(2) A bibliography that does not just provide a bunch of links, but explains what the texts are, how they might be useful, and also any issues that might not be apparent at first (e.g. is the book out-of-print or hard to source, a common issue with small fields).\n\n \n \n\n(3) Hire artists to create and imagine web3 specific solarpunk art works. What does a solarpunk DAO in the future look like? What does a solarpunk squad or guild look like? What about web3 public goods in some science fiction future city?\n\n \n\nMore holistically and less quantifiable, I want to help kickstart more interest in solarpunk as a possible political imaginary to be adopted by web3. Right now, we are still somewhere between the cypherpunk/hacker-engineer culture of Bitcoin and Ethereum and I think solarpunk would represent a new set of possibilities we can collectively believe in.\n\n \n\n**How?** I have produced several peer-reviewed academic articles and written extensively on cryptocurrency. I will approach this research with the same rigour as any other but will instead let it be assessed by the community, in true web3 spirit, rather than an academic journal (where it would get paywalled). I hope to also use the community to host some calls where we discuss these ideas and get feedback on what should be included in the introduction or bibliography. I think these could be hosted under the umbrella of friendly web3 DAOs.\n\n \n\n**Why funding?** Web3 standards for design and aesthetics are high. I would like the logo, report and bibliography to use the artwork of solarpunk artists. In our space, we respect the value and cost producing art and therefore I want a budget that pays artists well and gets us the look and feel of a true solarpunk aesthetic worldview. What is produced should look good because solarpunk looks good!\n\n \n\n \n  \n ", "timestamp": 1635195843, "digest": "-w2V_UqilwL7T7WmHpZQUmaB13aLHtm54-s1YHkw4To", "contributor": "0xe428106034f2F8B1873d079e0ab8C078c96a35E5"}
{"id": "j4ZXrO_OPyvcIOF6LDxvjFx0128U3SaRd_FdqYGUiYA", "title": "STARS Token Distribution", "body": "Stargaze is one of the first NFT markets to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Cosmos is a network of custom interoperable blockchains. It is currently the second largest ecosystem by volume, and includes Terra, Cosmos Hub, Thorchain, and Osmosis.\n\nStargaze aims to be a decentralized NFT market, totally owned and governed by its users. Therefore, distribution of STARS has to be equitable, accessible, and cover a large surface area.\n\n## Token Release Schedule\n\nA fair initial distribution is pivotal in setting the future direction of a network. Paired with a thoughtful inflationary release schedule, a network can optimize its token distribution.\n\nThe distribution of STARS is designed to front-load inflation in order to bootstrap the network. This is a similar issuance schedule to Bitcoin. However, instead of halvings, issuance will be cut by 1/3 each year (by multiplying the current issuance by a reduction factor of 67%). Osmosis was the first protocol to use a [“thirding” token release schedule](https://medium.com/osmosis/osmo-token-distribution-ae27ea2bb4db) and heavily inspired Stargaze’s design.\n\nFor some background on using token incentives to bootstrap new networks, check out this great [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619?s=20) by Chris Dixon.\n\n![\"Thirding\" release schedule](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TwRgLvwwmYuxQ8c4BqR3f.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nStargaze will start with an initial supply of 1 billion STARS. An additional 1 billion STARS will be issued the first year. With this \"thirding\" schedule, the issuance for the following year will be 670M STARS. This leads to an **asymptotic max supply of 4 billion STARS**.\n\n![Total supply formula](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4zhWsUYN9KbC12rOFyAZM.png?height=126&width=1284)\n\n![Issuance calculations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ooIF-U44MYirt21oEg4LL.png?height=1542&width=1630)\n\nStargaze starts off decentralized on day one with a genesis supply that distributes the majority of the tokens to community members. The Foundation will hold a strategic reserve of tokens, and will drive adoption of the protocol by delegating to validators, onboarding creators, and providing grants for ecosystem development.\n\n![Community-focused genesis supply](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZTtjhTqZNqm1rNESQq8j2.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter 5 years, the initial distribution is only 27.6% of the entire token supply. This issuance schedule allows Stargaze to grow and adapt its ownership to new creators, curators, validators, delegators, and other stakeholders.\n\n![Genesis supply vs. new issuance after 5 years](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k_VH9Rk86klZ7IXo2ZbKC.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\n## Airdrop\n\nThe goal of the Stargaze airdrop is to reach the most active participants in the Cosmos ecosystem. Stakers and liquidity providers are more likely to be more active than just token holders. Therefore, Stargaze is doing its airdrop to a mix of network participants:\n\n* **ATOM stakers**\n* **OSMO stakers or liquidity providers**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Cosmos Hub**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Osmosis**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Regen Network**\n\nFor each role above, you will be able to claim **2,478 STARS**. Distributing a fixed amount is in the spirit of the original Uniswap airdrop, giving every user more or less an equal starting point. In order to claim your airdrop, you have to perform 4-5 actions on Stargaze when it launches. If you have used [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) or [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), you’re already familiar with performing tasks to claim tokens. Some claimable actions include bidding on NFTs, staking, and voting in governance.\n\nSome minimums were put in place to prevent dust accounts and those attempting to game airdrops:\n\n* **ATOM staker: 5 ATOM minimum staked**\n* **OSMO staker: 50 OSMO minimum staked**\n\nFurthermore, delegations to centralized exchange validators were excluded.\n\nFor example, if you’re an ATOM staker and OSMO LP, and meet the above minimums, then your airdrop reward is 4,956 STARS.\n\nOsmosis liquidity providers get the airdrop regardless if LP tokens are bonded or not.\n\nAirdrop claimable amounts start decaying 4 months after the launch of the NFT market. The decaying process linearly decreases the claimable amount for another 4 months.\n\n![Airdrop must be claimed to prevent decay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3_QgqhG1LETOtyBdL0a7P.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter the airdrop claim period, unclaimed STARS are sent to the Community Pool.\n\nSnapshots were taken on Oct 11th, 2021 from Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and Regen Network.\n\nTo see how much STARS you’re eligible to claim, please visit <https://stargaze.zone/airdrop>.\n\n***Note: Airdrops won’t be claimable until after Phase 3 of launch. Please see Phase 3 below.***\n\nhttp://stargaze.zone/airdrop\n\n## Reward Distribution\n\nNew token reward distribution will be optimized to facilitate the operations of the NFT market.\n\nThe initial breakdown per block will be:\n\n![Per block distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UzjJ1v4qZ-bF5zw1BY9kr.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAll chain parameters can be changed via governance vote. Everything suggested in this post are sensible defaults. We expect governance to adapt and change the protocol as it matures.\n\n### NFT Incentives\n\n45% of block rewards are set aside for NFT bidding and staking incentives. Token holders will be able to earn yield by bidding and staking on NFTs for certain periods of time. An upcoming post will outline this mechanic in detail.\n\nIf governance determines that NFT incentives are too high for achieving the desired effect of the protocol, they may direct these incentives towards the Community Pool where they can be spent later.\n\n### Staking Rewards\n\nAs per the course with proof-of-stake networks, validators (node operators) earn rewards for securing the network. They also accept delegations from token holders, and charge a commission of 5% or greater for providing the service.\n\nNearly 100 validators were selected to join mainnet after 3 testnets, 2 of which were incentivized. They will earn 35% of all block rewards.\n\n### Developer Rewards\n\nInitially, 15% of block rewards will go to fund the team that contributes to the development of Stargaze. Each account gets a specific weight set by governance. When a developer is no longer contributing, governance can choose to modify their weight or remove their allocation.\n\n### Community Pool\n\nThe Community Pool is the main DAO that operates the network. It is responsible for voting on parameter changes, software upgrades, community matters, and more. It will receive 5% of all block rewards.\n\n## Phased Launch\n\nSince Stargaze is a layer 1 blockchain with many moving parts, it will launch in phases.\n\n* **Phase 0: Chain launch with 0% inflation (Oct 29th)**\n* **Phase 1: Liquidity pools on [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and [Gravity DEX](https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/)**\n* **Phase 2: Governance proposal to enable inflation**\n* **Phase 3: Web app launch with first NFT drop**\n\nMore details about the liquidity pools will be forthcoming. Please follow us on social media (links below) for updates. They are planned for 2-3 weeks after Phase 0, and have to go through governance to be funded via the Community Pool.\n\nNew tokens won’t be issued until after Phase 2, when inflation kicks in. At this time you’ll be able to stake STARS at [stargaze.zone](http://stargaze.zone/) via [Keplr Wallet](http://keplr.app/).\n\nPhase 3 is expected to be completed before the end of the year. Airdrops will be claimable starting in this phase.\n\n## Follow Us\n\nTo follow along with Stargaze developments, check us out on Twitter at <https://twitter.com/StargazeZone>, and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StargazeZone\n\n[https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE)\n\nHappy Stargazing ✨🔭", "timestamp": 1635196205, "digest": "h9Bc7jODUrYB1Jw4mve3QEGVkBwBsyVebN6NP7tRl_Y", "contributor": "0x57a9Cb03cC8Ed919162d9024710ca9E886346299"}
{"id": "f0-0PBBtctLDBzC4VAAHOJaU-QV6MzsQQHUA-ZsWHuU", "title": "How can new data technology enhance rural revitalization？", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pGvQRPkFVCSgqa9gfE5XF.png?height=1568&width=2314)\n\n**Background：**\n\nWith the advent of the fourth industrial revolution, smart terminals such as mobile phones have become popular. The development of advanced tracking technologies has made it possible to collect human oriented, full-coverage and dynamic data （Long et al. 2016）for studying differences in human spatial-temporal behaviors ,which is promising in built environment design.\nAlong with urban areas, there are tens of thousands of villages which are entering the era of big data. The protection, continuation, renewal and development of these villages are still very important research and practice objects in designing and planning industry, so it is very important to use new data technology to intervene in Rural Revitalization process and village construction.\nThe ancestral temple，as the symbol of traditional family spirit and cultural lineage in the rural era ,is an important part of cultural heritage which has been attracting attention increasingly. This paper will focus on a specific ancestral temple and its sacrificial activities held during the Spring Festival. A pioneering experimental exploration and quantitative analysis will be conducted on how new data technology would augment the study and monitoring of the status quo ，the development and the rural cultural heritage protection.（Dang et al. 2016）\n\n**Related Research：**\n\n1 Lineage culture and Ancestor worship tradition\n\nLineage culture\nThe lineage culture constitutes a crucial component of traditional rural culture in China. the Chinese lineage was ‘the basic social unit of rural society’ (Fei, 2012, p. 72).    Influenced by Confucianism and its tenets of filial piety (Xiao), the culture honored predecessors' contributions to the whole family and taught members to show respect, love and Xiao to their ancestors and parents.     As Zheng (2001) argued, the lineage was an important local cultural force in ‘promoting morality and maintaining the traditional value system’ (p.23) in rural society.\n\nAncestor worship\nTo memorialize ancestors, many lineages built up symbolic ancestral temples. These places were sacred spaces where descendants enshrined and worshiped the deceased, and also solemn sites for clans to hold family meetings, enact and execute lineage rules, compile family trees and undertake lineage affairs(Chen, 2016). Every year, many worship activities and rites would be conducted in Incense Halls to offer sacrifice to their own ancestors with the same family name and seek for bless.\n\n2 Environment Behavior Study\nEnvironmental Behavior is devoted to the study of human behavior in built environment. In the past ,on-site observations, questionnaires, interviews and a few other methods have been the main traditional techniques to be engaged in environmental behavior studies (Li, 1991; Lin and Hu, 2006),which are already not efficient and sufficient to acquire full-time and full-coverage data.\nRecently, many advanced tracking technologies have been applied to the study of relevant spatial-temporal behavior,  mostly used at the urban scale, and the architectural scale focusing on the airports, shopping malls, campuses and other large-scale urban public buildings.（Lin and Huang, 2017）For our case in this study—ancestral temple space, the Wi-Fi system is chosen among the various ATT(advanced tracking technology) systems as the data source due to its series of reasons:\n(1)GPS tracking technology or antenna signal tracking cannot be used inside buildings.\n(2)Radio frequency identification or ultra wide band require the subjects to wear specific devices.\n(3)Bluetooth  IPS works well, but most people are not accustomed to keep the Bluetooth open.\n(4) Wi-Fi monitor is able to record activities of the mobile device unobtrusively. We could collect a substantial amount of long-term, full-coverage information without observer effect. (Huang et al., 2017)\n\n**Study Case**\n\nThe chosen ancestral hall of the Huang ' s clan is located in Shuinan village，a member of Anyi ancient village group in Nanchang City. The group consists of Luotian village, Shuinan village and Jingtai village. Among them, Luotian Village is surnamed Huang with a history of 1200 years., and Shuinan villagers are descendants of a branch of Huang from Ancient Luotian village. During the Spring Festival, The Huang's Ancestral Hall in Shuinan Village will usher in an annual ancestral worship activity, and serve as a centre for communal gatherings and ancestral worship ,which will also provide  rich data for this practical study.\n\n![The Huang's Ancestral Hall](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5qwtYybS6uTNlsh8U-w6e.png?height=916&width=932)\n\n![Shuinan village](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5rVQzIwiD61AJEDUjV93S.png?height=414&width=934)\n\n**Research Design**\n\nMethod Introduction\n\nWe use a Location system based on Wi-Fi to acquire behavior data, which has been used maturely in several cases (Huang et al., 2017; Lin and Huang, 2017). This technology can locate the mobile terminal based on proximity and signal strength through the trilateral positioning algorithm, thus achieving a precision positioning within 10-20 meters.(Huang et al., 2017)\nA well-planned network of APs is able to record the spatial-temporal locations of people, or mobile devices, to be precised, in a certain architectural space. Based on the inspection on the spot, we select 6 monitor APs, arranged in each layer of Huang's  ancestral hall and nearby roads to cover the whole potential gathering space around the Huang's Ancestral Hall. Data used in this paper will be mainly collected through the Wi-Fi IPS, in a time range of 7days/24 hours.\n\nThe study revolves the participators’ spatial-temporal trajectories around the Huang's Ancestral Hall. This study will record a whole-term data for seven-day duration with three stages  included， which is parallel with the ancestral worship ceremony.\n\nStage1\n2-3days before spring festival: the time when the officiants prepare sacrifices, clean the courtyards and Incense halls, and place the spirit tablets\n\nStage2\nOn spring festival: the same day for the ancestral worship ceremony. Our data is respected to reach a peak numbers of visitors\n\nStage3\n2-3days after spring festival : the time when flow of people are expected to taper off after the ceremony and the subsequent finishing processes.\n\nAfter the necessary data cleaning and processing, the Wi-Fi positioning data can provide full-range and whole-term human trajectories for environmental behavioral during the sacrifice duration ,which would provide support for the analysis of the change of human flow and Spatial Distribution Characteristics in ancient villages during festivals. Basing on the information,  we will conduct a detailed quantitative analysis and visual expression of people's activities during the target period around the living circle core, to reflect the real-time utilization of Public Space and discover the intrinsic logic  hidden in the environment.\n\n**Expected Result**\n\nThis 7-day observing result picturing a living circle around the ancestral temple during a special period would make it possible to compare special living behavior such as festivals, celebrations, collective activities with the normal living behavior, i.e. non-celebration period and daily routine.\nFurthermore，comparative analysis and trajectory clustering based on the different mobile phone data can also be used to classify the local villagers and tourists from the outside, so we can conduct a comparative study of  difference between the local and outside’s behavior during local festival. Additionally, we will use data in matrix including types of visitors and types of period to be coupled for further discussion.\n\nShort-time results and long-time results are both expected. The former would focus on the present peak number of people ,which can predict further flow and serve as an estimated criteria for subsequent service facilities complement，as well as the specific spatial distribution for future reference .\nThe latter dedicates to extract some laws from the local and outsider’s different behavior settings in both special and normal period. The research aims at providing subjective and quantized suggestions for public space planning and management，as well as maintenance and development.\n\nThe development of public space in name of tourist development has constantly proved detrimental to local community life. Therefore community planning should be taken as a serious issue ——The design of public space should be based on true understanding of lifestyles and activities of local community.\nGiven that there is a temporal alternating pattern between local community residents and tourists in the use of the old street (Liu ,2012), previous study, however, did not indicate spatial distributions of behavior settings. This paper will fill the blank. We will overlap all in-scale behavior setting records, making composite maps to further analyze the dynamics of public architecture utilization patterns based on big data. Based on the temporal-spatial coupled patterns of utilization of public space between local residents and visitors, we can seek a dynamic balance between them by creating a resilient and inclusive design well adapted to local quo allowing broad range of possibilities.\nFor the long term, with the development of the rural area, a daily behavior setting systems for local residents can be conducted to determine how exactly the local community could adjust to the transformation of the community (Liu ,2012), which can serve as an empirical enlightenment for rural vitalization when we interfere it.\n\n**Reference**\n\n\\[1\\]Long Ying, Shen Yao.

Some claimable actions include bidding on NFTs, staking, and voting in governance.\n\nSome minimums were put in place to prevent dust accounts and those attempting to game airdrops:\n\n* **ATOM staker: 5 ATOM minimum staked**\n* **OSMO staker: 50 OSMO minimum staked**\n\nFurthermore, delegations to centralized exchange validators were excluded.\n\nFor example, if you’re an ATOM staker and OSMO LP, and meet the above minimums, then your airdrop reward is 4,956 STARS.\n\nOsmosis liquidity providers get the airdrop regardless if LP tokens are bonded or not.\n\nAirdrop claimable amounts start decaying 4 months after the launch of the NFT market. The decaying process linearly decreases the claimable amount for another 4 months.\n\n![Airdrop must be claimed to prevent decay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3_QgqhG1LETOtyBdL0a7P.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter the airdrop claim period, unclaimed STARS are sent to the Community Pool.\n\nSnapshots were taken on Oct 11th, 2021 from Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and Regen Network.\n\nTo see how much STARS you’re eligible to claim, please visit <https://stargaze.zone/airdrop>.\n\n***Note: Airdrops won’t be claimable until after Phase 3 of launch. Please see Phase 3 below.***\n\nhttp://stargaze.zone/airdrop\n\n## Reward Distribution\n\nNew token reward distribution will be optimized to facilitate the operations of the NFT market.\n\nThe initial breakdown per block will be:\n\n![Per block distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UzjJ1v4qZ-bF5zw1BY9kr.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAll chain parameters can be changed via governance vote. Everything suggested in this post are sensible defaults. We expect governance to adapt and change the protocol as it matures.\n\n### NFT Incentives\n\n45% of block rewards are set aside for NFT bidding and staking incentives. Token holders will be able to earn yield by bidding and staking on NFTs for certain periods of time. An upcoming post will outline this mechanic in detail.\n\nIf governance determines that NFT incentives are too high for achieving the desired effect of the protocol, they may direct these incentives towards the Community Pool where they can be spent later.\n\n### Staking Rewards\n\nAs per the course with proof-of-stake networks, validators (node operators) earn rewards for securing the network. They also accept delegations from token holders, and charge a commission of 5% or greater for providing the service.\n\nNearly 100 validators were selected to join mainnet after 3 testnets, 2 of which were incentivized. They will earn 35% of all block rewards.\n\n### Developer Rewards\n\nInitially, 15% of block rewards will go to fund the team that contributes to the development of Stargaze. Each account gets a specific weight set by governance. When a developer is no longer contributing, governance can choose to modify their weight or remove their allocation.\n\n### Community Pool\n\nThe Community Pool is the main DAO that operates the network. It is responsible for voting on parameter changes, software upgrades, community matters, and more. It will receive 5% of all block rewards.\n\n## Phased Launch\n\nSince Stargaze is a layer 1 blockchain with many moving parts, it will launch in phases.\n\n* **Phase 0: Chain launch with 0% inflation (Oct 29th)**\n* **Phase 1: Liquidity pools on [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and [Gravity DEX](https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/)**\n* **Phase 2: Governance proposal to enable inflation**\n* **Phase 3: Web app launch with first NFT drop**\n\nMore details about the liquidity pools will be forthcoming. Please follow us on social media (links below) for updates. They are planned for 2-3 weeks after Phase 0, and have to go through governance to be funded via the Community Pool.\n\nNew tokens won’t be issued until after Phase 2, when inflation kicks in. At this time you’ll be able to stake STARS at [stargaze.zone](http://stargaze.zone/) via [Keplr Wallet](http://keplr.app/).\n\nPhase 3 is expected to be completed before the end of the year. Airdrops will be claimable starting in this phase.\n\n## Follow Us\n\nTo follow along with Stargaze developments, check us out on Twitter at <https://twitter.com/StargazeZone>, and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StargazeZone\n\n[https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE)\n\nHappy Stargazing ✨🔭", "timestamp": 1635196645, "digest": "h9Bc7jODUrYB1Jw4mve3QEGVkBwBsyVebN6NP7tRl_Y", "contributor": "0x57a9Cb03cC8Ed919162d9024710ca9E886346299"}

{"id": "Y1HBCzbuURqEqYruEed69GbRaln8E4nYe1DdFUim3Ng", "title": "STARS Token Distribution", "body": "Stargaze is one of the first NFT markets to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Cosmos is a network of custom interoperable blockchains. It is currently the second largest ecosystem by volume, and includes Terra, Cosmos Hub, Thorchain, and Osmosis.\n\nStargaze aims to be a decentralized NFT market, totally owned and governed by its users. Therefore, distribution of STARS has to be equitable, accessible, and cover a large surface area.\n\n## Token Release Schedule\n\nA fair initial distribution is pivotal in setting the future direction of a network. Paired with a thoughtful inflationary release schedule, a network can optimize its token distribution.\n\nThe distribution of STARS is designed to front-load inflation in order to bootstrap the network. This is a similar issuance schedule to Bitcoin. However, instead of halvings, issuance will be cut by 1/3 each year (by multiplying the current issuance by a reduction factor of 2/3). Osmosis was the first protocol to use a [“thirding” token release schedule](https://medium.com/osmosis/osmo-token-distribution-ae27ea2bb4db) and heavily inspired Stargaze’s design.\n\nFor some background on using token incentives to bootstrap new networks, check out this great [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619?s=20) by Chris Dixon.\n\n![\"Thirding\" release schedule](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TwRgLvwwmYuxQ8c4BqR3f.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nStargaze will start with an initial supply of 1 billion STARS. An additional 1 billion STARS will be issued the first year. With this \"thirding\" schedule, the issuance for the following year will be 670M STARS. This leads to an **asymptotic max supply of 4 billion STARS**.\n\n![Total supply formula](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4zhWsUYN9KbC12rOFyAZM.png?height=126&width=1284)\n\n![Issuance calculations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ooIF-U44MYirt21oEg4LL.png?height=1542&width=1630)\n\nStargaze starts off decentralized on day one with a genesis supply that distributes the majority of the tokens to community members. The Foundation will hold a strategic reserve of tokens, and will drive adoption of the protocol by delegating to validators, onboarding creators, and providing grants for ecosystem development.\n\n![Community-focused genesis supply](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZTtjhTqZNqm1rNESQq8j2.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter 5 years, the initial distribution is only 27.6% of the entire token supply. This issuance schedule allows Stargaze to grow and adapt its ownership to new creators, curators, validators, delegators, and other stakeholders.\n\n![Genesis supply vs. new issuance after 5 years](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k_VH9Rk86klZ7IXo2ZbKC.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nTokens for seed investors, validators, founders, and advisors are locked up for 1 year, and linearly vest after that for another 6 months - 1 year. This helps align values with the the development team and early stakeholders.\n\n## Airdrop\n\nThe goal of the Stargaze airdrop is to reach the most active participants in the Cosmos ecosystem. Stakers and liquidity providers are more likely to be more active than just token holders. Therefore, Stargaze is doing its airdrop to a mix of network participants:\n\n* **ATOM stakers**\n* **OSMO stakers or liquidity providers**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Cosmos Hub**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Osmosis**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Regen Network**\n\nFor each role above, you will be able to claim **2,478 STARS**. Distributing a fixed amount is in the spirit of the original Uniswap airdrop, giving every user more or less an equal starting point. In order to claim your airdrop, you have to perform 4-5 actions on Stargaze when it launches. If you have used [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) or [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), you’re already familiar with performing tasks to claim tokens. Some claimable actions include bidding on NFTs, staking, and voting in governance.\n\nSome minimums were put in place to prevent dust accounts and those attempting to game airdrops:\n\n* **ATOM staker: 5 ATOM minimum staked**\n* **OSMO staker: 50 OSMO minimum staked**\n\nFurthermore, delegations to centralized exchange validators were excluded.\n\nFor example, if you’re an ATOM staker and OSMO LP, and meet the above minimums, then your airdrop reward is 4,956 STARS.\n\nOsmosis liquidity providers get the airdrop regardless if LP tokens are bonded or not.\n\nAirdrop claimable amounts start decaying 4 months after the launch of the NFT market. The decaying process linearly decreases the claimable amount for another 4 months.\n\n![Airdrop must be claimed to prevent decay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3_QgqhG1LETOtyBdL0a7P.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter the airdrop claim period, unclaimed STARS are sent to the Community Pool.\n\nSnapshots were taken on Oct 11th, 2021 from Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and Regen Network.\n\nTo see how much STARS you’re eligible to claim, please visit <https://stargaze.zone/airdrop>.\n\n***Note: Airdrops won’t be claimable until after Phase 3 of launch. Please see Phase 3 below.***\n\nhttp://stargaze.zone/airdrop\n\n## Reward Distribution\n\nNew token reward distribution will be optimized to facilitate the operations of the NFT market.\n\nThe initial breakdown per block will be:\n\n![Per block distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UzjJ1v4qZ-bF5zw1BY9kr.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAll chain parameters can be changed via governance vote. Everything suggested in this post are sensible defaults. We expect governance to adapt and change the protocol as it matures.\n\n### NFT Incentives\n\n45% of block rewards are set aside for NFT bidding and staking incentives. Token holders will be able to earn yield by bidding and staking on NFTs for certain periods of time. An upcoming post will outline this mechanic in detail.\n\nIf governance determines that NFT incentives are too high for achieving the desired effect of the protocol, they may direct these incentives towards the Community Pool where they can be spent later.\n\n### Staking Rewards\n\nAs per the course with proof-of-stake networks, validators (node operators) earn rewards for securing the network. They also accept delegations from token holders, and charge a commission of 5% or greater for providing the service.\n\nNearly 100 validators were selected to join mainnet after 3 testnets, 2 of which were incentivized. They will earn 35% of all block rewards.\n\n### Developer Rewards\n\nInitially, 15% of block rewards will go to fund the team that contributes to the development of Stargaze. Each account gets a specific weight set by governance. When a developer is no longer contributing, governance can choose to modify their weight or remove their allocation.\n\n### Community Pool\n\nThe Community Pool is the main DAO that operates the network. It is responsible for voting on parameter changes, software upgrades, community matters, and more. It will receive 5% of all block rewards.\n\n## Phased Launch\n\nSince Stargaze is a layer 1 blockchain with many moving parts, it will launch in phases.\n\n* **Phase 0: Chain launch with 0% inflation (Oct 29th)**\n* **Phase 1: Liquidity pools on [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and [Gravity DEX](https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/)**\n* **Phase 2: Governance proposal to enable inflation**\n* **Phase 3: Web app launch with first NFT drop**\n\nMore details about the liquidity pools will be forthcoming. Please follow us on social media (links below) for updates. They are planned for 2-3 weeks after Phase 0, and have to go through governance to be funded via the Community Pool.\n\nNew tokens won’t be issued until after Phase 2, when inflation kicks in.

{"id": "qr_BE489sdmHmdnLm8QpIcr1egbMlnL_JCARyZCpilM", "title": "历史分析：从法国古典园林到西方现代园林", "body": "摘要：本文通过对法国古典花园及相关西方现代园林的研究 ，阐述总结了古典园林的特点，并结合相关案例，归纳并探讨西方现代园林与古典园林之间的关系。重点从营造手法方面分析与阐述了西方现代园林对古典园林的继承与发展，启迪现代园林的创作与实践。\n\n法国的传统园林都在世界园林史上占据非常重要的地位，深入探讨西方景观园林的营造思想和手法，总结法国古典景观园林的景观特色、造园思想与造园要素，结合法国最优秀现代园林进行对比分析，将有助于解读西方现代园林对古典园林的继承与发展。\n\n### 一、法国古典园林的产生背景与特点\n\n17世纪下半叶，路易十四彻底巩固了国家的统一和封建专制制度，把绝对君权推向顶峰。这一时期是法国科学和哲学兴盛的时代，也是古典主义文艺思潮席卷法国和欧洲的时代。当时的政治制度、美学哲学思想及西方古典主义绘画的特点，都对古典主义造园艺术产生了深远的影响。\n\n**古典园林的造园思想与景观特色**\n\n西方园林营造思想是一种通过控制自然、征服自然来实现自然美的自然美学思想。强调“驾驭自然，改造自然，强迫自然接受均衡的法则”。法国古典园林的景观形态所体现的基本上是一种建筑美，诉诸简明、规则的几何图案，人们常将法国式园林比喻为“绿色建筑”。\n\n古典主义造园家勒诺特尔从法国的国土风貌中提炼出平原、密林、农田、河流等要素，形成几何形的台地、丛林、花坛、运河、水池等要素，并按照对称均衡的原则布置成一个和谐的空间。图案式的丛林、花坛、草坪、水面组成一系列“绿色厅堂”，如同一座巨大的“绿色宫殿”。法国古典园林从凡尔赛到枫丹白露，园林的布局都是几何板块式的，植物也经过经心修剪布置，规矩方正的草坪和水渠，无一不表现出严整规则的秩序感。\n\n### 二、西方古典园林营造原理和造园法则\n\n2\\.1 几何学原理与规则式园林造园法则\n\n规则式园林的要素及空间皆显示出明确的几何形式，所以又称“几何式园林”；它的造园要素形式规整、布置整齐，树木花草修剪整形，还称“整形式园林”；而规模宏大、地势平坦、以模纹花坛著称的法国古典主义园林则被人们称为“平面图案式园林”。纵观法国古典造园历史，基于逻辑与理性的规则式园林正是从几何学中开出的花朵，从现代西方园林中也能看到其永恒的影响。\n\n早在公元前3 000年的古埃及、古印度和古巴比伦时期，就出现了有关几何学的记载。随着几何学的发展，人们对客观事物的认知也在不断加深。几何学的研究对象从图形到体积，从平面到立体，从空间到太空，极大地扩大了西方人的视野和研究领域。几何学研究方法也从运用公理来推论、到论证公理本身、再到公理法体系的建立，此为由“象”入“理”。大大地提高了人们的思维和论证能力，为严谨的合乎理性的园林设计方法的形成打下了坚实的基础。\n\n2\\.2  美学思想与规则式园林造园法则\n\n毕达哥拉斯把“数”看作是一切事物的本质，强调事物的性质是由某种数量关系所决定的，并且万物按照一定的数量比例而构成和谐的秩序，据此提出了“美在和谐”这一著名的美学命题。亚里士多德也说：“数学能促进人们对美的特性——数值、比例、秩序等的认识”，强调数学研究方法对美学研究的作用，认为“美的主要形式是秩序、匀称与明确”，指出井然有序、整体均衡在审美中的重要作用。古典主义美学追求一种绝对的、永恒的“美”的概念，“美产生于尺度和比例”，这正是古典造园师创造“美”的标尺。\n\n总结得出，几何学对古典主义园林的影响主要体现在两个方面：\n\n（1）形成了基于空间的造园要素和布局结构等形式风格。——古典的几何学以图形空间为主要研究对象，本身是一种直观性很强的视觉艺术，促使园林在要素和空间上出现几何形体化倾向。\n\n（2）产生了基于理性的美学思想和创作方法等造园理论。——建立在数学、几何学基础之上的美学原则，把追求简洁、对称、均衡、统一视为核心价值，强调比例、尺度的重要作用。景物、轴线、空间等布局经过深思熟虑，都是理性思维的产物。\n\n2\\.3  几何学原理在实际造园中的具体运用——透视原理的运用\n\n中国绘画与西方绘画具有完全不同的表达方式——西方古典绘画重视写生和描摹，而中国绘画重在写意。因此，西方人发明了焦点透视，来再现真实的自然；东方则利用多重角度的“看”，来达到某种完整的表达。这两种不同的视觉逻辑可被总结为“注视”和“扫视”。\n\n·中国画——平面性——表达空间深度——利用扫视的路径逻辑来推动并作画面的记录\n\n·西方古典主义绘画——透视法 选一个最佳透视点 表达真实三维空间——利用定点欣赏即注视的逻辑来作画面的记录  注重静止的欣赏\n\n因此在西方的造园过程中，重要视点上的画面营造尤为重要——为了在重要视点上创造更加均衡的画面，需要对透视效果加以巧妙的校正。比如古典主义园林规模宏大，随着中轴线的不断延伸，难免出现线条、图形、空间的透视变形问题，必须对极其深远的透视带来的变形加以修正，透视原理被巧妙地用来加强或减弱空间的深远感。\n\n### 三、西方现代园林对古典园林的继承与发展\n\n3\\.1 领土意识的传承与转化——整体性\n\n法国古典主义园林无论面积的大小，都会有与外界环境紧密对话，通过园林中轴线空间无限的延伸，将园林中的自然景观渗透进入城市之中。 整体性的设计理念将各类要素紧密编织进花园的空间结构体系中，并通过相互之间的联系，层层拓展开来。 法国现代园林景观设计深受到这一理念的影响，逐渐形成了领土景观意识。\n\n但要注意的是，在法国古典主义花园中，空间拓展是以花园为主体，以外部环境为辅助。 在当时的时代背景下，花园为掌权者建造，不需要过多的考虑城市的问题或其他人的使用需求。而现代公园的规划设计却需要将思路与意识反转，公园本身要以谦卑的态度融于领土景观。花园作为客体寻求与外部环境的融合，以最好服务市民，是顺应现代城市发展的必然结果。\n\n园林与城市为一体的整体性意识得以传承，但现代园林景观与古典主义园林在空间拓展上完全相反的设计思路，正是随着时代变迁而注定发生的转化。\n\n3\\.2 造园手法的继承与发展\n\n3\\.2.1传承与发展——清晰的空间结构\n\n法国古典园林特点\n\n·轴线的嬗变\n\n法国古典主义园林清晰的空间结构来源于轴线的统领作用，并通过控制地形、 组织视线，来实现空间的集中性和画面感。\n\n·主次对比\n\n法国古典主义园林构图强调分清主次，通过以轴线景观为主体，次要轴线辅助；空间结构上以中心开阔的大空间与周围规则郁闭的小空间对比，通过对称的几何形式强化了空间结构，统率全局。\n\n通过几世纪的演变，法国现代园林与古典主义园林具有根本性的差异。 古典主义园林体现皇权至上的设计理念，决定了其庞大的尺度感与集中式的空间流线。 轴线是园林中最为重要的游览路径与景观视廊，串联所有最精致的设计元素。\n\n而现代园林景观更多地满足公共空间使用的需求，不再是统治者的个人享受，同时尺度也更亲人。轴线成为了更小尺度上的空间控制要素，在一些公园、城市广场中虽仍能分辨出空间布局中轴线的存在，但它们被打散分解，布局更为灵活，消融于景观之中，形成了分散、丰富的空间流线。\n\n3\\.2.2 传承与发展——构图几何与强烈的形式特征\n\n当理解“构图几何”时，不应只是狭隘地拘泥于圆、方等形式语言，应理解到现代园林景观绝不是简单地原样照搬图案花纹样式，而是运用图案式形式语言的整体布局模式，及抽象部分形态要素。与古典主义园林相比，现代园林所体现出的空间形态和构图样式比古典图案式更为简洁、灵活、多变。同时，精准的构图几何关系，则进一步强化清晰空间结构。\n\n雪铁龙公园的整体空间结构就是一个具有强烈个性与创造性的典型。该公园的空间结构严谨规整，两个玻璃温室及中间的喷泉水景，大草坪及草坪南侧的大台阶，白色拱桥共同形成了一条隐晦的中心线。温室高约15m，长45m，成为控制大草坪的重要建筑元素。温室之间的喷泉整体倾斜向大草坪，进一步增强了空间的关联性和中心线的整体趋势。公园的中心大草坪长约300m，宽约100m，以极小的倾斜坡度整体趋向于塞纳河岸，两侧的植物、 构筑物和方形的高篱以对称的形式语言强化了轴线的结构，自然的河流成为轴线的结点。\n\n3\\.3 传承与发展——造园要素的现代演绎\n\n法国古典园林图案语言在法国古典主义园林中，简洁的几何形体是最主要的形式语言。形式语言极强的造园要素，按照理性逻辑精心排列在公园中，形成一帧帧清晰精致的景观。这一章节将具体解构巴黎雪铁龙公园，并分析幻想花园的景观序列，揭示西方现代公园是怎样提取古典园林中的造园要素，抽象并恰到好处的运用在设计中。\n\n3\\.3.1 植物要素\n\n法国园林的理论基础来自建筑学，树木的规则式种植、几何形修剪，正是为了构成“绿色建筑”的规则造型。单一植物品种丛植能使整个群落在形状、色彩、季相变化、生长速度等方便保持一致，从而保证“绿色建筑”的稳定性。平坦的草坪不仅有利于烘托各“绿色建筑”群的鲜明轮廓，其本身也是“绿色广场”。运用植物要素的相互组合分隔空间，同时营造宁静、典雅的花园气氛。\n\n3\\.3.2 建筑要素\n\n雕塑作为建筑艺术的附属品，一直在法国园林中占有非常重要的地位。它不仅用于装饰花园中的住宅，还常与喷泉组合或是独立地布置在花园中，形成局部景点的构图中心。\n\n3\\.3.3 水要素\n\n法国古典园林中的水体大多应用法国平原上常见的湖泊、河流的形式，各种水体都呈方、园、八角形等规则的几何形状。处理手法主要有水渠、喷泉、壕沟、运河。法国园林多用静水，面积大，以气魄与宁静取胜，形成典雅、从容的风格。又称“水镜”。水镜往往都在透视和投影关系上仔细推敲过，以保证主体建筑在视角范围内完整地倒映水中。喷泉主要布置在轴线上或园路的交点上，这是法国园林中重要的造景要素之一。\n\n**案例1 雪铁龙公园**\n\n![雪铁龙公园平面图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PuruyWq6SJ9wlFXDuTH29.png?height=1140&width=1896)\n\n·法国古典园林模纹花坛——中心大草坪\n\n刺绣花坛起源于法国古典主义园林，刺绣花坛有清晰的、简洁的边界，在矩形、方形、圆形等形体内部来实现变化丰富的花坛样式，强化艺术的震撼力。大面积的草坪为频繁运用的表现手法。\n\n雪铁龙公园中心的大草坪被设计者命名为\"parterre vert”——绿色花坛之意，是对法国古典园林中草坪花坛的继承，它是整个设计的“核”。四周被方正的水渠围绕，与周边丰富多样的小空间形成了鲜明的对比。\n\n·丛林园——七个小花园\n\n丛林园在意大利文艺复兴时期就开始在园林中使用。在法国古典主义园林中，丛林园常常位于中心开阔空间的周边地区，尺度小，林荫茂密，被限定在规整的方格网形式布局之中。丛林园内部是自由多样的构图形式，在每一个区域内部都分为不同的私密空间和舒适尺度。\n\n与此对应的是温室旁的一系列小花园。中心草坪一侧的七块狭长场地结合地形，形成七个立体、半封闭的花园。这些以植物种植为主的花园各有主题。\n\n金色园、红色园、白色园、橙色园、绿色园、蓝色园，以及“运动之园”这七个部分组成的系列空间的设计概念来自一周中的七天。设计师用色彩带给人的情感联想来诠释日常生活中人们每一天的情绪变化。并通过不同植物种类——乔木、灌木的叶色和质感以及草本植物的花色和小品、地面材质的对比以突出个性与特征。\n\n·古典园林建筑——高大树篱\n\n在园林营造中，经常把园林植物充当建筑材料来使用。经过修剪的造型植物通常与建筑物或者构筑物相配合， 起到界定空间的作用。 高大的乔木经过整形修剪会在空间中形成边角硬朗的体块， 其高大的尺度甚至超过人工的建筑。\n\n水渠旁边修剪的高大树篱，限定中央大草坪的空间，并作为进入周围一系列小花园的过渡。提供了竖向的围合，丰富了天际线。\n\n·古典园林柱厅回廊——柱状树阵\n\n西方建筑以石结构为主流，西方建筑最重要的风格特征为柱式，以古希腊建筑的3种柱式（多利克式、艾奥尼亚式、科林斯式）为典型。\n\n法国园林中，从植的植物群体或园艺群落往往由单一的或有限的几种植物构成；被修剪成几何形体，按照规则式或行列式种植。规则式的植物景观具有庄严、肃穆的气氛，给人以雄伟的气魄感。\n\n雪铁龙公园中，修剪成柱状的树阵暗示法国古典园林的柱厅回廊，一定程度上限定中心草坪空间。\n\n·自然边界——野生散植花卉\n\n植物不再是供人赏玩的对象， 而是生态过程中与人平等的要素，在城市之中营造第一自然。具有东方园林的意味。\n\n**案例2 西方古典园林中水的塑造——幻想花园**\n\n幻想花园位于法国里昂和波尔多之间的泰拉松市。泰拉松镇面积不大，是一个有着悠久历史的老城市，Vezere河流经城市，幻想花园就位于河边的山坡上。幻想花园是一个东西长，南北窄的长条形花园，全园共有13个主题景点。凯瑟琳·古斯塔夫森为这个花园设计了一条环形路线，全部景点由这一条环全园的道路一一串起。主入口位于地块的最低点。\n\n古斯塔夫森的设计有着明确的方向性，精心布置在花园中的水渠、风向标以及漂浮在林间的金色铝带明确地引导着视线，使得幻想花园的结构骨骼清晰。花架绿廊引导着人们进入花园深处，林中的金色飘带吸引人们走进森林，道路的转角处常常设有喷泉引导视线。除了具体的景观构筑物，更多推动人们向前的是看不见的景观元素：潺潺的流水声、玫瑰的香气、明亮的草坪。结构上的方向性是从一系列清晰展开的游览序列展开，其中，水作为最重要的线索贯穿于整个花园之中。\n\n![幻想花园平面图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sdeD1jX5nqpv6kn5Nop2w.jpg?height=566&width=860)\n\n一条小路从小城向上延伸到花园大门,伴随着一条与之相平行的细水渠。沿着林地小路,浓密的黄杨木林里隐藏着几条水梯,晶莹的水流飞跃而下。\n\n转角处草地中有两条细细的喷泉，作为水花园的前奏。进入流水园，高潮迭起：花园中几乎有着水的所有形式。流水园内部组织成传统的十字形结构,。这个水的空间被柳树和灌木丛环绕着,地面由石板铺砌,上面随意分布着若干喷水口。\n\n水花园的十字渠充满了欧洲古典花园的味道，其中东西向的水渠向东一直延伸，渐渐高出地面，随地形有几个跌落的台阶，直直地指向远处的山峦和无尽的天边。\n\n南北向的水渠则向南如瀑布般跌落入下面一个平静宽阔的池塘。池塘里,有多个随意安置的喷水装置。喷射出的水雾反射着阳光,水池边种着美丽的鸢尾，在水雾中形成宁静的气氛。\n\n从水花园出来，进入到喷泉小路，齐肩篱开出多个洞口，水从小方水池叠砌的花岗岩石块流下，顺石板的缝隙流入路边的暗沟。\n\n最后一个水景点是河流，在石子小路的路边安放有5组石板，每块石板上面刻有世界上主要的河流三角洲的平面图。水从三角洲的切口处流出，顺着带有凹槽的石板横跨过石子铺就的道路，再顺着山坡层层跌落黄杨篱边的道路。这五组水流象征了五大洲的河流。“五大洲河流”的水在流到黄杨树篱边的道路后，经过暗管回流向入口引道处的水渠。\n\n幻想花园的设计中，水串联了各个重要景观要素的作用。引导了整个花园游览的行进序列。水流的路径可以被看作是对水的应用的进步\\*\\*,\\*\\*从用于灌溉到作为赏心悦目的装饰，融入场地与园林的历史。无论是倾泻而下的瀑布、潺潺的小溪，还是安静的水渠、梦幻的水雾，动水、静水和倒影一同成为了讲述故事的载体。设计师还精心设计了水的“容器”，使得水的“肌理”细腻而变化丰富，带来丰富微妙的游赏体验。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Uv_TzshDj6Xe4ElvkRKp5.png?height=1118&width=1698)\n\n法国农业历史的遗迹通过水景的再设计被融进这座花园,包括蓄水池、喷灌系统和水渠。如水渠、蓄水池和梯田唤起了对当地农业历史的回忆。\n\n圆形剧场、十字形水渠、消失在远方的天际线、用植物修剪成的拱廊以及所有这些欧洲古典主义园林常用的设计元素，都被古斯塔夫森用艺术化的手法和具有现代感的方式表达了出来。随着游览路线一一呈现在游人眼前，仿佛开启了一扇欧洲古典园林的记忆之门。\n\n现代西方园林的尺度远远小于传统古典园林，地形限制也更常见。幻想花园空间布局神似而形散，游赏路线依山势而为，并没有古典园林中轴线等的特征，但它清晰的游览序列推进与古典园林营造方法的理性一脉相承；而对景观细节的刻画，与环境氛围的精心营造，形式与气质均取原型自西方古典园林，于细节处完美再现了一幅幅充满古典韵味的西方园林的缩影。\n\n·叙事性 ——

{"id": "cYXfc5VoM0YZrmVvG7pNrcqe9nPa8UtQ2Fukf7vmy1o", "title": "Daonomics", "body": "A DAO is an Automated Decentralized Organization that's formed by setting up an on-chain wallet, and then issuing votes over that wallet to multiple people, similar to a joint bank-account. These votes exist as an on-chain token which can bought and sold, or transferred to anyone. Votes can approve transactions like \"buy from this vendor\" or \"pay or don't pay this employee\" (ie hiring/firing).\n\nBecause these votes have programatic access to a wallet, they can be *backed* by the wallet. With enough votes, you could create transactions that exchange tokens for %'s of the wallet. Or, if you have more than 50% of the votes, you could just take all the money in the wallet. In other words, there is actual value in the votes.\n\nAny company that incorporates as a DAO today, instead of a traditional LLC or C corp, can access immediate liquidity. Because the DAO is on-chain, every transaction it makes is auditable and public by anyone in the world. In exchange, a market can form for purchasing that voting share, which allows the founders and employees the ability to exit immediately. That's a powerful incentive.\n\nHowever, that liquidity is only as valuable as its control over the wallet. Because a vote share of more than 50% (a 51% attack) could steal all the money in the wallet, the original founders are incentivized to sell off or give away as much of their equity to as many individual groups as possible. If any individual entity controls 51% of the wallet, then the value of the vote becomes worthless instantly as the other 49% rush to sell. To clarify, the sell off can happen by automated program; so it really is *instant.* In other words, the founders of the DAO actually need to relinquish control over the DAO in order to profit from it. Their votes are worthless if they control it, since they could at any point transfer the entire wallet to a wallet and disappear; like what's already happened in several projects.\n\nBecause the DAO is a program, it needs an \"oracle\", or a real-world entity, to confirm that something happened. For example, if the DAO buys a plot of land, the DAO program is trusting that the receiver of the funds actually has the land in the real world, and really gave it over. The real-estate company here is acting as an \"oracle\" over the exchange of land.\n\nHowever, if the DAO trusts the real-estate oracle, the value of it's votes will go down, because the real-estate company could \"steal\" some portion of the wallet by not giving the real-world product. In the old world, sales of products are slow and require human intervention. But an automated, on-chain company, buys things with code; a smart contract that executes the transaction. The most efficient autonomous company is one that has little human intervention as possible; typically by creating a programatic marketplace for vendor goods. The DAO code doesn't vote to buy land; they create a programatic land *marketplace* for other people to compete on.\n\nBecause it's a publicly callable program, any transaction that doesn't have a trusted oracle proving that the goods were provided is a security vulnerability. Otherwise, anyone could simply call the \"sellLand\" function and receive funds and then just not provide the land.\n\nIn an old-world company, the potential for fraud always exists. But in an automated company, or DAO, if there's potential for fraud, it is *guaranteed* to happen. An automated \"fraud bot\" will immediately take advantage of every untrusted oracle exploit the moment it appears. This is already the case in computer security today. The second you put a website on the internet, bots will instantly hit your IP with every exploit they know.\n\nIn an old-world company, you could take the fraudster to court. But in the new-world DAO, the fraudster is a program, connected to nobody, paying out to someone in a different country, or even a nefarious nation state as cryptowarfare.\n\nFor the DAO, every vote holder's vote is a vote over less money if some portion is being paid out to an untrusted \"real-estate\" vendor, because some % of the wallet could disappear by a fraudulent vendor failing to provide real-world goods.\n\nHowever, if a different real-estate company came along that the DAO doesn't *need* to trust, then that real-estate company would win the business of the DAO.\n\nIf the real-estate DAO gives voting power to their DAO customers, the customer DAO can trust the real-estate DAO's oracle. The customer DAO has control over the real-estate DAO, and can program against that trust. The real-estate DAO needs to give away voting control anyway in order to prevent a 51% attack; but selling or giving away their voting power to their customers makes them competitive relative to traditional corporations who DAO customers cannot trust.\n\nTo recap, new companies are incentivized to incorporate as DAOs in order to get immediate liquidity. In order to prevent a 51% attack, they're incentivized further to sell or give away as much as possible of their initial voting rights. And to sell to other DAOs, who need to be able to securely trust the new entity, the new entity is incentivized to give their voting share to their customers.\n\nImagine we have a Shoemaker DAO. The Shoemaker DAO purchases leather from the Leather DAO and the Rubber DAO, which in turn purchase from their own DAOs. If you own the voting rights of the Shoemaker DAO, you also own the voting rights of the Leather DAO and the Rubber DAO and the entire supply chain of that shoe. In other words, *the end of the DAO chain owns every company in the supply chain*.\n\n```jsx\nShoemaker DAO -> Leather DAO -> Cow DAO -> Hay DAO\n              -> Rubber DAO\n```\n\nIt is vitally important that the end-owner is not a small group of entities. However, the danger of a 51% attack pushes the end of the DAO supply chain to once again distribute their token to as wide of audience as possible.\n\nIn the best case scenario, the owners the end of the chain (the owners of the Shoemaker DAO in this case) are the customers of the DAO and the workers of the DAOs. In this scenario, the entire world has shared joint voting rights in the new crypto economy.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, end-chain DAOs will control a majority voting share in the entire economy and are able to collective execute a 51% attack on every DAO ever. This would create the most powerful centralized force in the history of the world; it could hold the world hostage by threatening an economic meltdown.\n\nIn order to get the best-case scenario, we need Cryptopolicies.\n\nA Cryptopolicy is an on-chain program that takes DAO voting tokens and returns back it's own Policy Token. At any time, users of the program can get their DAO tokens back; so the Policy Token has the same value as the DAO token. In other words, a Cryptopolicy lets multiple people pool their voting tokens and then vote together without losing their economic value. If more than 51% of DAO tokens are owned by the Cryptopolicy program, it can execute a series of votes in every DAO along the entire supply chain of the world economy.\n\nIn other words Cryptopolicies provide a solution to collective action problems. For example, a Cryptopolicy could allow the world to \"vote\" to simultaneously stop burning fossil fuels, instantaneously. The owners of the token don't need to know every single DAO in the world, the Cryptopolicy is an open-source, audible program that executes the votes in every relevant DAO.\n\nIn a DAO world, a Cryptopolicy can be used to enact any real-world policy you want. For example, a Cryptopolicy could implement a policy requiring fire alarms in workplaces; by linking a fire-alarm inspection DAO with a voting policy to stop transferring funds to the manager of the workplace. Because Cryptopolicies have voting control over every wallet in a supply chain, they could also used to implement VAT taxes to fund public goods, like research grants, healthcare, basic incomes, public transportation, etc.\n\nCryptopolicies can also be used by DAOs to protect themselves from 51% attacks in their suppliers. For example, you could write a Cryptopolicy in which several DAOs agree that if any supplier is at risk of a 51% attack, it will immediately clone the program, spin up a new DAO, and transfer every contract to the new DAO. This kill switch ensures that executing a 51% attack is both costly for the attacker and worthless as an outcome.\n\nIn the current world, the government acts as a monopoly over use of force. It's vital that in the new DAO economy, we ensure that we don't create \"mercenary oracles\" that offer force as a service to an on-chain program.\n\nIn a DAO world, a government can act as a single, monopolistic oracle over the use of force, by spinning up a \"government DAO\" with non-tradable voting tokens issued to everyone in the country. The governmental force oracle implements real-world arrests in a manner set down by the votes of a government. Like every DAO, it's an on-chain program that can be composed with the code of every other DAO and Cryptopolicies.\n\nIn order to avoid a financial meltdown from a single 51% attack on the economy, a force oracle protocol could be used by an organization like the SEC to force end-chain DAOs to give voting rights to their customers and workers in order to prevent a singular end-chain DAO from executing a 51% attack on the economy.\n\nThe alternative is that a government could \"crack down\" on DAOs and attempt to prevent their economy from DAOifying. However, any country to do this would isolate themselves from the rest of the world economy; effectively ensuring their economic doom. If the country instead decides to temporarily crack down, and then rejoin the DAO economy, it would lose out on early ownership in the new economy.\n\nHowever, if the DAO economy is owned by the customers and the workers, every DAO would likely vote to reduce value capture in their vendors.

But the incentive of the customer is to reduce the value capture of the Shoemaker DAO.\n\nIn other words, the DAO economy is the hyper economy: exponentially increasing productivity, collectively owned by the world.", "timestamp": 1635198639, "digest": "WnA316fCk0IeU1ESC5F9wuIbkR1cZ6uFBqzcCkFjeE8", "contributor": "0xC048a401b9419177Bc76Ca0174C6Df216e71Ca56"}
{"id": "6QH_m-sM6wxmJL3X5z7cgKaWH1qN8KJxCAdxc-DVU4U", "title": "Daonomics", "body": "A DAO is an Automated Decentralized Organization that's formed by setting up an on-chain wallet, and then issuing votes over that wallet to multiple people, similar to a joint bank-account. These votes exist as an on-chain token which can bought and sold, or transferred to anyone. Votes can approve transactions like \"buy from this vendor\" or \"pay or don't pay this employee\" (ie hiring/firing).\n\nBecause these votes have programatic access to a wallet, they can be *backed* by the wallet. With enough votes, you could create transactions that exchange tokens for %'s of the wallet. Or, if you have more than 50% of the votes, you could just take all the money in the wallet. In other words, there is actual value in the votes.\n\nAny company that incorporates as a DAO today, instead of a traditional LLC or C corp, can access immediate liquidity. Because the DAO is on-chain, every transaction it makes is auditable and public by anyone in the world. In exchange, a market can form for purchasing that voting share, which allows the founders and employees the ability to exit immediately. That's a powerful incentive.\n\nHowever, that liquidity is only as valuable as its control over the wallet. Because a vote share of more than 50% (a 51% attack) could steal all the money in the wallet, the original founders are incentivized to sell off or give away as much of their equity to as many individual groups as possible. If any individual entity controls 51% of the wallet, then the value of the vote becomes worthless instantly as the other 49% rush to sell. To clarify, the sell off can happen by automated program; so it really is *instant.* In other words, the founders of the DAO actually need to relinquish control over the DAO in order to profit from it. Their votes are worthless if they control it, since they could at any point transfer the entire wallet to a wallet and disappear; like what's already happened in several projects.\n\nBecause the DAO is a program, it needs an \"oracle\", or a real-world entity, to confirm that something happened. For example, if the DAO buys a plot of land, the DAO program is trusting that the receiver of the funds actually has the land in the real world, and really gave it over. The real-estate company here is acting as an \"oracle\" over the exchange of land.\n\nHowever, if the DAO trusts the real-estate oracle, the value of it's votes will go down, because the real-estate company could \"steal\" some portion of the wallet by not giving the real-world product. In the old world, sales of products are slow and require human intervention. But an automated, on-chain company, buys things with code; a smart contract that executes the transaction. The most efficient autonomous company is one that has little human intervention as possible; typically by creating a programatic marketplace for vendor goods. The DAO code doesn't vote to buy land; they create a programatic land *marketplace* for other people to compete on.\n\nBecause it's a publicly callable program, any transaction that doesn't have a trusted oracle proving that the goods were provided is a security vulnerability. Otherwise, anyone could simply call the \"sellLand\" function and receive funds and then just not provide the land.\n\nIn an old-world company, the potential for fraud always exists. But in an automated company, or DAO, if there's potential for fraud, it is *guaranteed* to happen. An automated \"fraud bot\" will immediately take advantage of every untrusted oracle exploit the moment it appears. This is already the case in computer security today. The second you put a website on the internet, bots will instantly hit your IP with every exploit they know.\n\nIn an old-world company, you could take the fraudster to court. But in the new-world DAO, the fraudster is a program, connected to nobody, paying out to someone in a different country, or even a nefarious nation state as cryptowarfare.\n\nFor the DAO, every vote holder's vote is a vote over less money if some portion is being paid out to an untrusted \"real-estate\" vendor, because some % of the wallet could disappear by a fraudulent vendor failing to provide real-world goods.\n\nHowever, if a different real-estate company came along that the DAO doesn't *need* to trust, then that real-estate company would win the business of the DAO.\n\nIf the real-estate DAO gives voting power to their DAO customers, the customer DAO can trust the real-estate DAO's oracle. The customer DAO has control over the real-estate DAO, and can program against that trust. The real-estate DAO needs to give away voting control anyway in order to prevent a 51% attack; but selling or giving away their voting power to their customers makes them competitive relative to traditional corporations who DAO customers cannot trust.\n\nTo recap, new companies are incentivized to incorporate as DAOs in order to get immediate liquidity. In order to prevent a 51% attack, they're incentivized further to sell or give away as much as possible of their initial voting rights. And to sell to other DAOs, who need to be able to securely trust the new entity, the new entity is incentivized to give their voting share to their customers.\n\nImagine we have a Shoemaker DAO. The Shoemaker DAO purchases leather from the Leather DAO and the Rubber DAO, which in turn purchase from their own DAOs. If you own the voting rights of the Shoemaker DAO, you also own the voting rights of the Leather DAO and the Rubber DAO and the entire supply chain of that shoe. In other words, *the end of the DAO chain owns every company in the supply chain*.\n\n```jsx\nShoemaker DAO -> Leather DAO -> Cow DAO -> Hay DAO\n              -> Rubber DAO\n```\n\nIt is vitally important that the end-owner is not a small group of entities. However, the danger of a 51% attack pushes the end of the DAO supply chain to once again distribute their token to as wide of audience as possible.\n\nIn the best case scenario, the owners the end of the chain (the owners of the Shoemaker DAO in this case) are the customers of the DAO and the workers of the DAOs. In this scenario, the entire world has shared joint voting rights in the new crypto economy.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, end-chain DAOs will control a majority voting share in the entire economy and are able to collective execute a 51% attack on every DAO ever. This would create the most powerful centralized force in the history of the world; it could hold the world hostage by threatening an economic meltdown.\n\nIn order to get the best-case scenario, we need Cryptopolicies.\n\nA Cryptopolicy is an on-chain program that takes DAO voting tokens and returns back it's own Policy Token. At any time, users of the program can get their DAO tokens back; so the Policy Token has the same value as the DAO token. In other words, a Cryptopolicy lets multiple people pool their voting tokens and then vote together without losing their economic value. If more than 51% of DAO tokens are owned by the Cryptopolicy program, it can execute a series of votes in every DAO along the entire supply chain of the world economy.\n\nIn other words Cryptopolicies provide a solution to collective action problems. For example, a Cryptopolicy could allow the world to \"vote\" to simultaneously stop burning fossil fuels, instantaneously. The owners of the token don't need to know every single DAO in the world, the Cryptopolicy is an open-source, audible program that executes the votes in every relevant DAO.\n\nIn a DAO world, a Cryptopolicy can be used to enact any real-world policy you want. For example, a Cryptopolicy could implement a policy requiring fire alarms in workplaces; by linking a fire-alarm inspection DAO with a voting policy to stop transferring funds to the manager of the workplace. Because Cryptopolicies have voting control over every wallet in a supply chain, they could also used to implement VAT taxes to fund public goods, like research grants, healthcare, basic incomes, public transportation, etc.\n\nCryptopolicies can also be used by DAOs to protect themselves from 51% attacks in their suppliers. For example, you could write a Cryptopolicy in which several DAOs agree that if any supplier is at risk of a 51% attack, it will immediately clone the program, spin up a new DAO, and transfer every contract to the new DAO. This kill switch ensures that executing a 51% attack is both costly for the attacker and worthless as an outcome.\n\nIn the current world, the government acts as a monopoly over use of force. It's vital that in the new DAO economy, we ensure that we don't create \"mercenary oracles\" that offer force as a service to an on-chain program.\n\nIn a DAO world, a government can act as a single, monopolistic oracle over the use of force, by spinning up a \"government DAO\" with non-tradable voting tokens issued to everyone in the country. The governmental force oracle implements real-world arrests in a manner set down by the votes of a government. Like every DAO, it's an on-chain program that can be composed with the code of every other DAO and Cryptopolicies.\n\nIn order to avoid a financial meltdown from a single 51% attack on the economy, a force oracle protocol could be used by an organization like the SEC to force end-chain DAOs to give voting rights to their customers and workers in order to prevent a singular end-chain DAO from executing a 51% attack on the economy.\n\nThe alternative is that a government could \"crack down\" on DAOs and attempt to prevent their economy from DAOifying. However, any country to do this would isolate themselves from the rest of the world economy; effectively ensuring their economic doom. If the country instead decides to temporarily crack down, and then rejoin the DAO economy, it would lose out on early ownership in the new economy.\n\nHowever, if the DAO economy is owned by the customers and the workers, every DAO would likely vote to reduce value capture in their vendors. After all, the incentive of the Shoemaker DAO is to reduce value capture of the Leathermaker DAO. But the incentive of the customer is to reduce the value capture of the Shoemaker DAO.\n\nIn other words, the DAO economy is the hyper economy: exponentially increasing productivity, collectively owned by the world.", "timestamp": 1635198821, "digest": "WnA316fCk0IeU1ESC5F9wuIbkR1cZ6uFBqzcCkFjeE8", "contributor": "0xC048a401b9419177Bc76Ca0174C6Df216e71Ca56"}

"**从DeFi的创新逻辑看利率赛道的兴起**\n\n1、信用的横向扩张：将更多的基础资产作为优质信用；或创造新的资产类型（如时间价值）\n\n2、信用的纵向扩张：利用时间价值工具来增添杠杆；通过对负债风险管理让杠杆运行得更有效\n\n利率的核心要素：**资产的时间价值**\n\n资产分为三个层次的资产：\n\n**负债成本的风险管理解决方案，将使得金融杠杆更有效**\n\nDeFi就是管理自身的资产负债表，资产端产生的收益中扣除负债端的资金成本后的差额保留为收益。因此，对于DeFi协议的债务端，将需要**负债成本，期限管理和风险管理**，从而导致基于利率维度的“纵向扩展”，\n\n背景：之前的DeFi产品多为可变利率，通常以（预期）年收益率 (APY) 来衡量。典型例子包括 [Compound 的 cTokens](https://compound.finance/docs/ctokens) 和 [Uniswap LP shares](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/V3-overview/glossary#pquidity-provider--lp)。\n\n对于希望获得稳定利率，或从利率变动中获利的用户需求未得到满足。因此出现了很多项目正在填补这一空白，这些固定收益协议，或 [固定利率及利率衍生品](https://messari.io/article/fixed-income-protocols-the-next-wave-of-defi-innovation) 和交易未来收益的协议，主要分为三大阵营：固定利率赛道主要可以分为：零息债券项目（yield）、收益代币化（pendl、element）、风险分级类产品（saffron、Tranchess）。\n\n**其中利率作为一种新的资产 更极致、更合理地把DeFi中的所有的资产价值激活出来。**\n\n### 传统金融领域的利率定价\n\n在传统金融领域，零息债券是一种债券工具，它的交易价格会低于面值，到期后会按票面价格对持有人支付本息。由当前价格决定的即为 收益率。\n\n假设B（t，T）为在时间T（到期日）到期的单位债券在时间t（运行时间）的价格，我们假设时间是离散的，那么对于一个时间段r，记t=rn为运行时间；T=rN为到期时间（r=1/12或r=1），并用记号B（n，N）代替零息单位债券价格B（t，T）。 从最简单的单位零息债券说起，B是债券价格。r是最小单位时间。y（0）表示的是从时间0开始计算，**通过现值确定的利率（即收益率）。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VDhQjmrH8zP-nF05Yt8m4.png?height=126&width=2050)\n\n因此，对于满足条件的0<n<N的运行时间瞬间n隐含的收益率，对于每一个n，都存在一个数y（n）满足：\n\n![此时y（n）与N无关，即到期日不同的债券产生的收益率相同](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vt4txJfI61kHzotZfO98O.png?height=118&width=1908)\n\n而对于一般的期限结构，零息单位债券的价格B（n，N）决定的一组收益率y（n，N）为\n\n![此时y（n）与N有关，到期日不同的债券产生的收益率也不同](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6dYio-R-nFYIpca8SHsD4.png?height=108&width=1930)\n\ny（n,N）被称为利率的**期限结构**。由当前价格所决定的收益率y（0，N）成为**即期利率。**\n\n附息债券指的是在此期间被定期支付的息票可以再投资。对债券和衍生证券定价时，基本可以简化为寻找与之相联系的现金流，并利用未来现金流折现。那么作为**未来支付现值的附息债券价格**可以用即期利率写成如下形式：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/t6hzjt1yP2IM2pU77-gyu.png?height=102&width=1986)\n\n虽然对于附息债券我们不能单独用1个利率对未来支付进行折现，但是可以认为引入一个数作为利率y。这个利率被称为**到期收益率，定义为以上方程的解。**\n\n### DeFi板块的利率\n\n在传统的金融市场中，利率是对**不同风险资产定价的关键因素**，**利率期限结构**也可以反映人们对未来利率变化的期望。不同债券/资产的评级，信用等级和期限不同导致其利率也不尽相同。\n\n当我们在DeFi的背景下讨论利率时，需要讨论的真正问题其实是：\n\n在不同的信用等级该建立什么样的利率市场\n\n要创造哪些固定收益产品来满足金融杠杆需求\n\n如何设置不同期限的固定利率并进行定价，即利率期限结构（收益率曲线）\n\n**构建去中心利率市场的三种途径**\n\n1、在传统金融市场中，**国债收益率曲线**是所有固定收益产品定价的基准。基准收益率曲线是通过不同期限的零息国债构建的，其可以作为整个DeFi利率市场定价的基础。\n\n2、根据基准收益率曲线和风险价差，通过各种固定收益产品形成收益率曲线。\n\n3、基于即期利率收益率曲线，计算远期利率曲线，然后构建互换收益率曲线，从而为各类远期，期货和互换等利率衍生品提供定价基准。最终可以在DeFi市场上实现整个CDO产品发行流程，并且完善整个利率市场体系。\n\n### 1、固定利率协议的理论来源——Yield\n\n贡献：固定收益代币的理论建构\n\n2、有三个重大突破：\n\n固定利率借贷；\n\n利率市场；\n\n一个Yield曲线；\n\nYield 可以看作是基于 MakerDao 的固定利率协议，它将以 yToken （比如 yDAI）的形式发行零息债券，用户可以通过存放 ETH 等抵押品来铸造 yfToken。而借款人和放贷人可以通过 yfToken 直接实现借贷。\n\n实现形式如下：借款方如果想借出 DAI，需要抵押 ETH，系统自动铸成 yfDAI （这一步在用户界面上不会出现），并将 yfDAI 兑换成 DAI 给到放贷方。这里 yfDAI 的利率会根据市场价格上下浮动。其中 yfDAI 和 DAI 的折价就是借款方所要支付的利息。放贷方则可以存入 DAI 来折价获得 yfDAI，折价部分就是到期收益率。放贷方购买时可以选择不同的期限，不同的期限收益率不同。到期之后可以使用 yfDAI 1:1 兑回 DAI。流程可以简化成以下：\n\n**借款人 A**\n\n• 存入抵押物 ETH\n\n• 铸成 yfDAI\n\n• 将 yfDAI 锁进智能合约中，根据不同的期数兑换回 DAI，因为折价，所兑换成的 DAI 的数量将少于 yfDAI\n\n• 到期偿还了 DAI 后，赎回抵押的 ETH\n\n**放贷人Ｂ**\n\n• 将 DAI 存入智能合约中，换成 yfDAI，因为折价，yfDAI 的数量大于 DAI\n\n• 到期后，将 yfDAI１：１兑换成 DAI\n\nYield 可以看作是简易版固定利率协议。假设你以0.95 Dai的价格购买了一年后结算的1 yDai，那你的收益率是固定的，因为你有固定数量的投资资本（0.95 Dai）和已知数量的未来回报（一年后为1 Dai），你可以计算yDai的到期收益率，即是5.3％。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iaKJv9jcEX3JOvL-ixL_0.png?height=146&width=1794)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QKJBoPIwdY5fmKL1B5S2i.png?height=142&width=1784)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4WifEyLyy3WMKkQuwUiyX.png?height=150&width=1752)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AC0kr3TG1rKw0sSeCOvQf.png?height=146&width=1760)\n\n左图：通过确保到期日1：1赎回原始资产，通过当前汇率创造固定借款利率。\n\n右图：加入时间维度的固定收益代币AMM曲线\n\n\\*加入时间参数，假设时间距离到期日为1/t，此时对fytoken根据“**收益空间**”的定价应当为p\n\n联立（1）（2）得：p=（y/x）^t

Yield Protocol: On-Chain Lending With Interest Rate Discovery》\n\n《YieldSpace: An Automated Liquidity Provider for Fixed Yield Tokens》\n\n**Tranchess**\n\nTranchess在三种投资者间做了更好的协调，用DeFi机制和生态代币，让其更加去中心化的同时，优化了传统基金的收益机制，\n\n**1.QUEEN ——**面向长期持有者，提供\n\n用户质押BTCB生成或使用USDC购买，QUEEN的持有者可以直接享有BTC的波动收益，以及质押QUEEN获得CHEES代币奖励，**适合长期持有BTC的投资者**。 一个QUEEN可生成0.5个BISHOP和0.5个ROOK，分别和USDC形成交易对。\n\n**2.BISHOP ——**相当于是放贷者。\n\nBISHOP 可以使用USDC购买，或拆分QUEEN而得到。BISHOP的持有者每天可以获取稳定的利息收入，不受市场变动影响，**适合喜欢稳定收益的投资者。**\n\n**3.ROOK：2**倍杠杆投资者，只付利息，没有清算风险。\n\nROOK可以使用USDC购买，或拆分QUEEN而得到。ROOK的持有者享有的是杠杆收益，因为BISHOP不享有BTC波动收益的，所以拆分QUEEN后，0.5 ROOK就可以享有类比单个QUEEN的收益，也就是2倍杠杆，但ROOK的持有者需要每天向BISHOP的持有者付息，因为ROOK的持有者从BISHOP的持有者中借入了股权，才以实现杠杆收益。ROOK的持有者的收益=基金的盈亏-支付的利息。**适合喜欢高风险高收益的投资者**\n\n**当前收益聚合协议实现固定利率的方式不尽相同。**\n\n从收益来源可以分成两类：\n\n一、去中心借贷协议的固定利率；\n\n二、自动做市商/yield farming 机枪池的固定利率\n\n底层资产的波动性；\n\n**实现固定利率的方式主要有三种：**\n\n**1、风险分级：**\n\n**具体实现有两种模式：**\n\n**I 对于借贷/yield farming协议，本金债券+收益代币；定期债券NFT，优先级用户的固定收益；+ERC20浮动利率代币**\n\n**然后两者分别都能去市场上和稳定币形成币对，进行交易。**\n\n**ii 对于质押主流波动性资产，收益来源于底层资产的波动性；**\n\n1ETH的所有权拆分成高风险代币和低风险代币两个等级。这两个代币都代表着未来的收益权。当ETH价格下跌时，低风险用户的收益利率固定，高风险用户为**低风险**用户的利率波动风险买单，这种实际上可以看成，对于一个收益率不确定的投资策略，低风险用户向高风险用户提供一定量的贷款，从而让高风险用户加杠杆；\n\n**2、资金池模式：提供固定存款利息+平台代币激励+收取服务费用**\n\n**88mph采用资金池的模式来实现固定利率**\n\n88mph的利率定价是基于底层资金池过去30天利率EMA的75%来定价。当前吸引用户抵押存款的要点在于MPH代币奖励而非固定利率，用户取回存款时需要扣除一定比例的；ANC也是如此\n\n**市场规模**\n\n当前细分行业的币种/项目数量，投资规模，市值。用户参与度，盈利水平。\n\n•\n\n**竞争分析**\n\n**竞争要素**\n\n根据上述行业分析结论，归纳总结进入行业的主要障碍、以及竞争关键资源或要素等。\n\n**竞争态势**\n\n包括行业梯队分层、主要竞争对手分析、与主要竞争对手相比当前项目的优劣势、竞争项目及主要竞争对手的数据及其比较分析等。\n\n \n\n固定利率借贷的需求主要来自于

期权市场规模和未来发展趋势\n\n1、2020年是期权市场的元年。期权市场仍处于早期阶段，增速迅猛\n\n2020年期权成交量在衍生品总交易量占比约0.62%，尚处早期。全年期权交易量增幅达到487%\n\n2、期权交易业务主要分布在中心化交易所，且Deribit作为头部力量，占全年期权交易量的84%;其中Deribit交易所集中了大量机构投资者，而期权业务规模较小的交易所多以个人投资者为主。\n\n3、期权交易所类型\n\n期权交易所分类为传统期权交易所、新兴期权交易所、合规期权交易所、奇异期权交易所、去中心化交易所共五类。去年的期权交易量增速主要在中心化交易所。 \n\n4、奇异期权进入数字资产期权市场\n\n2020年，奇异期权(Exotic Options)产品开始进入数字资产期权市场。奇异期权是比传统期权(标准的欧式或美式期权)更为复杂的投资衍生品，经营奇异期权业务的交易所主要包括Binance与FTX两家。分别为二元期权(Binary options)、跨式期权(Straddle)等\n\n5、去中心化期权交易所处于探索阶段，当前TVL占比衍生品赛道约为4.26%\n\n目前，链上期权产品仍处于探索阶段，由于期权的专业性和高风险性，从锁仓量角度看，去中心化交易所的锁仓量依然相对较低（2020年所有去中心化交易所总锁仓量仅为4.728亿美元，今年总锁仓量在）\n\n6、回归分析洞察\n\n（1）相较于比特币币价，期货与现货的历史波动率对期权交易量影响更大，其影响力超出比特币价格影响力逾千倍。\n\n（3）期货市场的波动对期权市场交易量的影响相对高于现货市场，这表明期货投资者更倾向于在投资组合中配置期权，用以对冲可能的市场风险。\n\n（3）期货交易量与前一天的BTC期权权利金额之间存在着显著联系，BTC期权权利金额的变动方向往往预示着第二天期货市场交易量的变动方向。\n\n机构型、对冲型和结构化产品的参与者将会继续入场。去中心化期权市场会和整个DeFi行业一起成长。\n\n![数据来源：《2020 年度数字资产期权交易行业研究报告 》](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SsHvyRUt8GXxczfWGCvv6.png?height=458&width=2208)\n\n### 期权赛道项目分析\n\n**一、HEGIC**\n\n是利用利用流动性池和对冲合约实现的链上美式期权交易平台。\n\n**官网：<https://www.hegic.co/>**\n\n**市场规模**：DeFi锁仓46名；期权市场锁仓量第一名；\n\n当前总锁仓金额为0.48亿，约占期权交易市场的45% <https://www.defipulse.com/hegic>\n\n**数据表现**：<https://duneanalytics.com/slash125/hegic-v2>\n\nHegic期权二级市场交易：未开放二级市场交易 <https://hetoro.com/h2m/> \n\n**Hegic 工作原理说明**\n\n三种角色，期权买家是holders：期权卖方用户称为writer；目前Hegic提供了ETH、WBTC资产的看空期权和看涨期权。\n\n**1、期权买方** \n\n(1)期权的买家与hegic的合约进行交互, 自定义参数(用户可以任意定制)(行权价, 行权日), 则可以购入期权代币, 即HEGIC 币.\n\n(2)在行权日之前, 如果期权买方盈余, 则可以行使期权，让合约回收HEGIC代币, 并获得盈利额(市价和行权价的差额) \n \n\n**2、期权卖方——流动性提供方**\n\n对于期权卖方而言，有两个流动性提供池：ETH和WBTC，分别支撑ETH与WBTC的期权。\n\n期权卖家用户, 如果想售卖ETH的看涨/看跌期权, 则将ETH资产抵押入ETH抵押品池子(这笔资产会被锁定14天), 同时将获得writeETH 代币， 期权的卖家想回收资产,  且其资产未被锁定满足回收资产的条件, 则可以调用合约的提取方法,销毁自己的writeDAI或者writeETH，合约会计算你在提供流动性期间的收益率并返回相应数量的资产。\n\n在向流动性池发送ETH或者WBTC后，writeASSET 代币将被铸造并发送到流动性提供方的地址。writeETH 代币的铸造公式是：𝛥𝑊=𝑊∗𝛥𝑃 /𝑃\n\n𝛥𝑊 = 其中ΔW –流动性提供者将收到的 writeETH 代币数量；ΔP –流动性提供者提供给矿池的 ETH 代币数量；W –已经分发的 writeETH 代币总量；P –提供给矿池的 ETH代币总量。\n\n提供流动性后，Writter将开始分享池子的premium。（将从下一个买入对冲合约的人赚取回报。之前期权的溢价或损失将不会分配给这个新的流动性提供者）。\n\n**3、期权交易过程**\n\n期权买方买入ETH看涨期权，缴纳premium10美金——premium发送到收益池——锁定流动池内相应行权数量的ETH——期权买方收到相应的Hegic，并且能够在持有期间的任何时候行使该期权合约（根据市场价格结算价差）。同时池子流动性提供者共同承担相应的亏损。结算通过利用uniswap，直接换算为等值的ETH，结算价差。\n\n**Hegic优劣势分析**\n\n**优势**\n\n1、对于卖方而言, 卖期权只涉及到一笔transaction, 即抵押资产, 相比于其他期权产品需要铸币, 添加流动性或在现货池交易, 这种方式更加节省手续费, 并且方便散户充当期权卖方\n\n2、期权卖方, 所有LP共同承担损失, 降低了期权卖方个体的风险；\n\n3、由于所有期权卖方用户, 共同提供流动性, 期权买方可以定制化期权参数(行权价行权日), 都能买到期权, 对于买方而言更加灵活。\n\n**劣势**\n\n1. 对于卖方而言, 缺乏灵活性, 无法选择要卖出的期权产品的参数(行权日, 行权价等), 因此对于卖方而言, 缺乏对冲风险的手段。本质上LP的收益是由期权买方的判断来决定的\n\n2、期权凭证相互之间不能自由流通, 由于Hegic的期权信息都不一样，买方买入期权后得到HEGIC代币后, 只能用于自己行权，不能相互交易。 \n \n\n**二、Opyn**\n\n**官网：<https://v1.opyn.co/#/>**\n\n**<https://v2.opyn.co/#/>**\n\n**市场规模**：当前总锁仓金额为0.38亿，是期权赛道第二大锁仓量\n\n<https://www.defipulse.com/opyn>\n\n<https://debank.com/projects?order_by=gvl%20desc&tag=options> \n \n\n**1、opyn v1 目前锁仓金额仅为1.3M**\n\nOpyn 主要是通过**欧式期权**为用户提供对冲和类似保险服务 UNI。\n\n当前主要是通过买入保护性UNI看跌期权，对冲币种下行等风险。其行权价格、行权时间都是平台确定的。**为标准化欧式期权。**\n\n（1）期权买方选项\n\n低价格（25）的看跌期权；高价格（32）的看涨期权 \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I1WBpqT5HXHqmPUeJE6bA.png?height=746&width=2164)\n\n由于是标准化的期权，因此可以可以在uniswap上以一定价格Premium（现价为2.75$）购买到 oUNIP，并且在行权到期前oToken都可以在uniswap上自由交易。行权日当天，如果UNI价格低于25$，就可以发送你的UNI和oUNIP到合约履行期权，收到25USDC/UNI。\n\n（2）期权卖方选项\n\n低价格（25）的看跌期权 ；高价格（32）的看涨期权 \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yew24uPCZHVyHxu7DUkQI.png?height=1032&width=1996)\n\n页面显示了期权卖方年预测ROI和Premium/USDC抵押品：\n\n存入一定的抵押品USDC，然后就可以铸造相应的看跌期权oUNIP，同种oUNIP 可以在Uniswap上自由交易。同时根据抵押品份额享受Premium的收益，但是如果有人行权，即未来价格跌至25以下，需要承担相应比例的亏损。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ltAAMqp31ioO4B44VJK1Q.png?height=1318&width=2112)\n\n \n\n**2、opyn v2 目前锁仓金额为37M**\n\nV2是通过0x trading Protocol实现oToken交易的。通过bid(sell)&ask（buy），得到/支付平台给定的premium价格。\n\n期权类型：WETH和WBTC两类看涨看跌期权；行权日是每个月11号与25号；其行权价格是平台确定的几个具体价格，**有11种标准化欧式期权。**\n\n（1）Bid\n\n抵押资产（卖出看涨抵押1个WETH，卖出看跌抵押行权价值的USDC）——铸造出期权代币oToken——允许oToken进入0x交易合约——卖出oToken \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1T1meh_XROIIQ8VdiIh7Y.png?height=1320&width=1982)\n\n（2）Ask\n\n对于期权买方，USDC缴纳期权费，购买1 oToken后，可在行权日，凭借oToken在协议中进行行权，以现金的方式收回利润。其中，每个不同的期权产品铸造出的oToken均不同。对于买方来说代表着行权的权利，对于卖方来说代表着行权的义务或分享收益的权利。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zmHvEmEob8GCHzS7EMqK9.png?height=1326&width=1990)\n\n**3、特点：Opyn优化期权的流动性**\n\n 期权产品比较特殊，不同的行权价和行权日，会得到不同的期权费，由于期权种类比较多，每个单一的期权的交易流动性就会比较差，Opyn通过**差价期权**的方式进行流动性的改进。\n\n具体设计：对于期权卖方而言，与其用足额保证金来铸造出期权oToken，可以选择差价期权的方式来铸造oToken。例如，足额保证金的情况下，需要花100USDC铸造出1个ETH-USDC-100 Put，然而，**用差价期权的方式，可以先买入1个ETH-USDC-50 PUT，然后只需要花50USDC作为保证金就可以铸造出1个ETH-USDC-100 Put**\n\n**（此时ETH-USDC-50 已经有人提供了50USDC抵押金额，购买50put token大约在10$，这样操作的成本远小于100USDC的抵押金额，从而提高了期权的流动性）**\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n三、Ribbon Finance\n\n**官网：<https://app.ribbon.finance/>**\n\n**市场规模**：当前总锁仓金额为0.33亿，是期权赛道第三大锁仓量。\n\n**<https://www.defipulse.com/ribbon-finance>**\n\n \n \n\n**介绍：**“第一个致力于为DeFi市场提供结构性产品的项目。构建可以通过跨协议（主要是和Hegic和Opyn）组合创建的新金融产品，以帮助用户获得比他们自己所能实现的更高的风险回报率。”\n\n<https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_44383880/article/details/117308847>\n\n \n \n\n它提出了结构化存款产品，保证到期时按照面值支付给持有人，并通过长期看涨期权带来额外回报**将零息债券和一种资产的长期看涨期权相结合。（结构化理财产品和我们solv产品有一定类似！）**\n\n（1）从单一期权策略到**token+期权对冲收益**聚合策略\n\nRibbon提供的第一个产品是一种被称为”Strangle”的波动性策略。Strangle是一种期权策略，即在同一期限内**以不同的执行价格同时买入价外（OTM）看涨期权和看跌期权**。经验丰富的期权交易员和DeFi用户可以自己执行此策略，但是Ribbon通过使用Hegic和Opyn根据交易规模找到最便宜的链上价格来为投资者打包这一策略。鉴于部署这一策略时，以太坊网络的Gas费用很高（2021年第一季度），因此该团队决定停止提供该产品，并将其工作重点**放在提高收益率的产品上**，他们称之为 \"Theta vaults\"。\n\n（2）Theta vaults和Puts Theta Vault\n\n \n \n\nRibbon有两个资管产品，三月底推出Theta Vault，5月底推出Puts Theta Vault。\n\n其中Theta Vault 是一个专注于 ETH 和 BTC 的收益策略，运行 Covered Call 策略。Covered call= Long Stock + Short Call**，指同时买入一份token和卖出一份call（看涨期权）**，这适合不会出现大幅度暴跌的优质标的，略微看涨。要选择足够接近市场价格的行权价，确保最大限度的溢价获取。  \n\nRibbon Finance决定行权价格和行权日。实行这一机制的原因是，个人在链上采取这种策略会非常困难。Ribbon Finance与Opyn合作铸造oToken，然后与做市商（链下，采取预言机）合作，将oToken交换为WETH。这意味着Ribbon vault能够以WETH的形式收取溢价，而做市商以oToken的形式收取溢价。\n\n随着项目的成熟和发展，这个“管理者”的角色将被下放到社区中，以提供新的方式来处理协议。\n\n资管产品Puts Theta Vault\n\nPuts Theta Vault 出售看跌期权，用户只需将 USDC 存入智能合约，Ribbon每周自动完成该期权策略。Ribbon 计划之后将会提供以 ETH 或 WBTC 等非 USDC 资产抵押的 Puts Theta Vaults。用户只需要将资产存入智能合约，就会**自动开始运行特定的期权策略，减轻了 Gas 费用过高的问题。**\n\n \n \n\n该资金库通过运行一个自动策略，抵押USDC，出**售ETH价外看跌期权。**该资金库每周在Opyn上出售**OTM看跌期权**，获取溢价并每周进行再投资，以获得复合收益率。如果期权到期，资金库有义务以预先确定的执行价格购买标的资产，即“逢低买入”。最大的利润被预先定义为收到的premium。适用于长期看涨某项资产、希望逢低买入的人。\n\n### 期权清算", "timestamp":

{"id": "eFYffmlJWdG3AsEzQxc-mTEl3I52txPtOHslVURx3k0", "title": "STARS Token Distribution", "body": "Stargaze is one of the first NFT markets to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Cosmos is a network of custom interoperable blockchains. It is currently the second largest ecosystem by volume, and includes Terra, Cosmos Hub, Thorchain, and Osmosis.\n\nStargaze aims to be a decentralized NFT market, totally owned and governed by its users. Therefore, distribution of STARS has to be equitable, accessible, and cover a large surface area.\n\n## Token Release Schedule\n\nA fair initial distribution is pivotal in setting the future direction of a network. Paired with a thoughtful inflationary release schedule, a network can optimize its token distribution.\n\nThe distribution of STARS is designed to front-load inflation in order to bootstrap the network. This is a similar issuance schedule to Bitcoin. However, instead of halvings, issuance will be cut by 1/3 each year (by multiplying the current issuance by a reduction factor of 2/3). Osmosis was the first protocol to use a [“thirding” token release schedule](https://medium.com/osmosis/osmo-token-distribution-ae27ea2bb4db) and heavily inspired Stargaze’s design.\n\nFor some background on using token incentives to bootstrap new networks, check out this great [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619?s=20) by Chris Dixon.\n\n![\"Thirding\" release schedule](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TwRgLvwwmYuxQ8c4BqR3f.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nStargaze will start with an initial supply of 1 billion STARS. An additional 1 billion STARS will be issued the first year. With this \"thirding\" schedule, the issuance for the following year will be 667M STARS. This leads to an **asymptotic max supply of 4 billion STARS**.\n\n![Total supply formula](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4zhWsUYN9KbC12rOFyAZM.png?height=126&width=1284)\n\n![Issuance calculations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ooIF-U44MYirt21oEg4LL.png?height=1542&width=1630)\n\nStargaze starts off decentralized on day one with a genesis supply that distributes the majority of the tokens to community members. The Foundation will hold a strategic reserve of tokens, and will drive adoption of the protocol by delegating to validators, onboarding creators, and providing grants for ecosystem development.\n\n![Community-focused genesis supply](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZTtjhTqZNqm1rNESQq8j2.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter 5 years, the initial distribution is only 27.6% of the entire token supply. This issuance schedule allows Stargaze to grow and adapt its ownership to new creators, curators, validators, delegators, and other stakeholders.\n\n![Genesis supply vs. new issuance after 5 years](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k_VH9Rk86klZ7IXo2ZbKC.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nTokens for seed investors, validators, founders, and advisors are locked up for 1 year, and linearly vest after that for another 6 months - 1 year. This helps align values with the the development team and early stakeholders.\n\n## Airdrop\n\nThe goal of the Stargaze airdrop is to reach the most active participants in the Cosmos ecosystem. Stakers and liquidity providers are more likely to be more active than just token holders. Therefore, Stargaze is doing its airdrop to a mix of network participants:\n\n* **ATOM stakers**\n* **OSMO stakers or liquidity providers**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Cosmos Hub**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Osmosis**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Regen Network**\n\nFor each role above, you will be able to claim **2,453 STARS**. Distributing a fixed amount is in the spirit of the original Uniswap airdrop, giving every user more or less an equal starting point. In order to claim your airdrop, you have to perform 4-5 actions on Stargaze when it launches. If you have used [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) or [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), you’re already familiar with performing tasks to claim tokens. Some claimable actions include bidding on NFTs, staking, and voting in governance.\n\nSome minimums were put in place to prevent dust accounts and those attempting to game airdrops:\n\n* **ATOM staker: 5 ATOM minimum staked**\n* **OSMO staker: 50 OSMO minimum staked**\n\nFurthermore, delegations to centralized exchange validators were excluded.\n\nFor example, if you’re an ATOM staker and OSMO LP, and meet the above minimums, then your airdrop reward is 4,906 STARS.\n\nOsmosis liquidity providers get the airdrop regardless if LP tokens are bonded or not.\n\nAirdrop claimable amounts start decaying 4 months after the launch of the NFT market. The decaying process linearly decreases the claimable amount for another 4 months.\n\n![Airdrop must be claimed to prevent decay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3_QgqhG1LETOtyBdL0a7P.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter the airdrop claim period, unclaimed STARS are sent to the Community Pool.\n\nSnapshots were taken on Oct 11th, 2021 from Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and Regen Network.\n\nTo see how much STARS you’re eligible to claim, please visit <https://stargaze.zone/airdrop>.\n\n***Note: Airdrops won’t be claimable until after Phase 3 of launch. Please see Phase 3 below.***\n\nhttp://stargaze.zone/airdrop\n\n## Reward Distribution\n\nNew token reward distribution will be optimized to facilitate the operations of the NFT market.\n\nThe initial breakdown per block will be:\n\n![Per block distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UzjJ1v4qZ-bF5zw1BY9kr.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAll chain parameters can be changed via governance vote. Everything suggested in this post are sensible defaults. We expect governance to adapt and change the protocol as it matures.\n\n### NFT Incentives\n\n45% of block rewards are set aside for NFT bidding and staking incentives. Token holders will be able to earn yield by bidding and staking on NFTs for certain periods of time. An upcoming post will outline this mechanic in detail.\n\nIf governance determines that NFT incentives are too high for achieving the desired effect of the protocol, they may direct these incentives towards the Community Pool where they can be spent later.\n\n### Staking Rewards\n\nAs per the course with proof-of-stake networks, validators (node operators) earn rewards for securing the network. They also accept delegations from token holders, and charge a commission of 5% or greater for providing the service.\n\nNearly 100 validators were selected to join mainnet after 3 testnets, 2 of which were incentivized. They will earn 35% of all block rewards.\n\n### Developer Rewards\n\nInitially, 15% of block rewards will go to fund the team that contributes to the development of Stargaze. Each account gets a specific weight set by governance. When a developer is no longer contributing, governance can choose to modify their weight or remove their allocation.\n\n### Community Pool\n\nThe Community Pool is the main DAO that operates the network. It is responsible for voting on parameter changes, software upgrades, community matters, and more. It will receive 5% of all block rewards.\n\n## Phased Launch\n\nSince Stargaze is a layer 1 blockchain with many moving parts, it will launch in phases.\n\n* **Phase 0: Chain launch with 0% inflation (Oct 29th)**\n* **Phase 1: Liquidity pools on [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and [Gravity DEX](https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/)**\n* **Phase 2: Governance proposal to enable inflation**\n* **Phase 3: Web app launch with first NFT drop**\n\nMore details about the liquidity pools will be forthcoming. Please follow us on social media (links below) for updates. They are planned for 2-3 weeks after Phase 0, and have to go through governance to be funded via the Community Pool.\n\nNew tokens won’t be issued until after Phase 2, when inflation kicks in.

Sigle とは\n2. Sigle の始め方\n3. Sigle の使い方\n4. Sigle の未来予想\n\n## 1.Sigle とは\n\n* Sigleとは、プライバシーの保護に重点を置いたWeb3.0オープンソースブログプラットフォームです。分散型プロトコルを使用し、Stacks上で実行することで、ブロックチェーン上で記事を永久に保存できる可能性を提供します。\n* Stacksとは、ビットコイン上に構築された分散型アプリとスマートコントラクトのオープンソースネットワークです。スタックは、プログラム可能なベースレイヤーとしてのビットコインの可能性を最大限に引き出します。\n\n[Stacksの詳細↗](https://www.stacks.co/)\n\n簡単に言うと、ビットコインブロックチェーン上のブログです！\n\n以前に、Mirror（イーサリアム上の分散型ブログプラットフォーム）を紹介しましたが、\n\nMirrorはイーサリアム、Sigleはビットコインみたいな感じです。\n\n気になる方は、こちらの記事をどうぞ。\n\n[「Mirror」 ブロックチェーンブログプラットフォーム【始め方】](https://t.co/mpsUddOvTu?amp=1)\n\n特にビットコインを持ってないとダメとかないみたいで、誰でも簡単に使えるブログです（自分がリアルに調べながら書いています）まぁ、WordPressがブロックチェーン上にあるみたいなものです。それでは、説明にはいります。\n\n## ■ 2. Sigle の始め方\n\nまずは、公式のページにいきます。\n\n**[Sigle | THE EXPLORER GUILD](https://www.sigle.io/)**\n\n![](https://gaia.blockstack.org/hub/1NXFnPrM3mXukaK6ogw99eLnhNCpVECGHy/photos/WH40RozInyD7EO9uqmb2w/MbZs1e18IGB2Adr4mm6Bu-Screenshot%202021-10-19%2011.56.53.png)\n\nツイッターからも行けます▲\n\nサイトの画面途中に **\\[Get Started\\]** をクリックします。\n\nシークレットキー（秘密鍵）が表示されるのでコピーします。\n\n続いて、自分のアカウント名を決めます。\n\n以上です！！（簡単）\n\n## ■ 3. Sigle の使い方\n\nではでは、ブログの書き方になります。\n\nサイトの右上に、**\\[New story\\]** をクリックします。\n\nこれで、ブログを書くページになります。\n\nあとは、すらすらと本文を書くだけです。\n\n冒頭に、ツイートのリンクを貼ってますが、リンクをコピペするだけで、ブログっぽくイイ感じになりました。\n\n続いて、\\*ブログを書く上での機能 \\*の説明です。\n\nまずは、改行すると📷カメラのマークが出てきます。\n\nこれをクリックして、画像ファイルを選択すると画像が入ります。\n\nこんな感じです（例）🔽\n\n![](https://gaia.blockstack.org/hub/1NXFnPrM3mXukaK6ogw99eLnhNCpVECGHy/photos/WH40RozInyD7EO9uqmb2w/9nivAnQuE4ZbLnTphBLKf-Screenshot%202021-10-19%2012.20.37.png)\n\n続いて、文字を選択するとこんな感じのアイコンが出てきます。\n\n![](https://gaia.blockstack.org/hub/1NXFnPrM3mXukaK6ogw99eLnhNCpVECGHy/photos/WH40RozInyD7EO9uqmb2w/pRzWgOowWcHTKPaKKO_FN-Screenshot%202021-10-19%2019.40.24.png)\n\n左から順に説明していきますね。\n\n* \\[ **B** \\] ・・・ **太文字です。**\n* \\[***Ｉ*** \\] ・・・ *文字が斜めになります。*\n* \\[ **U** \\] ・・・**文字に下線部がはいります。**\n* \\[**< >**\\] ・・・`文字がやや小さくなりシャープな書体になります。`\n* \\[  **”**  \\] ・・・下記の左側にある線です。引用とかに使えそうですね。\n\n  > Sigle is a web 3.0 open source blogging platform focused on protecting your privacy.

Sigle の未来予想\n\nというわけで、Sigle概要がわかったと思います。\n\nSigle は、どういった問題を解決するのか？\n\n* 記事が勝手に消される\n* プラットフォームから削除される\n* 切り抜きによるフェイクニュースや陰謀論が広まる。\n* 著者に対する誹謗中傷\n\nこの辺りの意見は、ブログ書いている人なら聞いたことありますよね。\n\nブロックチェーンの上に構築された分散型ブログは、これらの問題を解決できそうですね。中央集権的なブログ（アメブロやはてなブログ）は会社が潰れたらすべて無くなりますよね。ブロックチェーン上では、改ざん出来ない記事となるので、きちんと証明できますね。\n\n記事に対して、ビットコインの投げ銭機能など追加されたらワクワクしますよね。\n\nおそらく、収益化できる構造に、今後アップデートされていくでしょう。\n\nおっちゃん的には、波乗りするために今後も期待して触っていきたいと思います。\n\nおわり。", "timestamp": 1635200482, "digest": "8fOCK3jU_dFLxdewt14bFDoMA3vty3qlNQZVPFsdXn4", "contributor": "0x6c9801C090DD8BfEBE45a63EeF187CeaaE3d2f00"}
{"id": "wCekD2UUg5q9tZfIQsq2uUPANr0JLHQi8rjSRRxGQlM", "title": "STARS Token Distribution", "body": "Stargaze is one of the first NFT markets to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Cosmos is a network of custom interoperable blockchains. It is currently the second largest ecosystem by volume, and includes Terra, Cosmos Hub, Thorchain, and Osmosis.\n\nStargaze aims to be a decentralized NFT market, totally owned and governed by its users. Therefore, distribution of STARS has to be equitable, accessible, and cover a large surface area.\n\n## Token Release Schedule\n\nA fair initial distribution is pivotal in setting the future direction of a network. Paired with a thoughtful inflationary release schedule, a network can optimize its token distribution.\n\nThe distribution of STARS is designed to front-load inflation in order to bootstrap the network. This is a similar issuance schedule to Bitcoin. However, instead of halvings, issuance will be cut by 1/3 each year (by multiplying the current issuance by a reduction factor of 2/3). Osmosis was the first protocol to use a [“thirding” token release schedule](https://medium.com/osmosis/osmo-token-distribution-ae27ea2bb4db) and heavily inspired Stargaze’s design.\n\nFor some background on using token incentives to bootstrap new networks, check out this great [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619?s=20) by Chris Dixon.\n\n![\"Thirding\" release schedule](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TwRgLvwwmYuxQ8c4BqR3f.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nStargaze will start with an initial supply of 1 billion STARS. An additional 1 billion STARS will be issued the first year. With this \"thirding\" schedule, the issuance for the following year will be 667M STARS. This leads to an **asymptotic max supply of 4 billion STARS**.\n\n![Total supply formula](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4zhWsUYN9KbC12rOFyAZM.png?height=126&width=1284)\n\n![Issuance calculations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ooIF-U44MYirt21oEg4LL.png?height=1542&width=1630)\n\nStargaze starts off decentralized on day one with a genesis supply that distributes the majority of the tokens to community members. The Foundation will hold a strategic reserve of tokens, and will drive adoption of the protocol by delegating to validators, onboarding creators, and providing grants for ecosystem development.\n\n![Community-focused genesis supply](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZTtjhTqZNqm1rNESQq8j2.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter 5 years, the initial distribution is only 27.6% of the entire token supply. This issuance schedule allows Stargaze to grow and adapt its ownership to new creators, curators, validators, delegators, and other stakeholders.\n\n![Genesis supply vs. new issuance after 5 years](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k_VH9Rk86klZ7IXo2ZbKC.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nTokens for seed investors, validators, founders, and advisors are locked up for 1 year, and linearly vest after that for another 6 months - 1 year. This helps align values with the the development team and early stakeholders.\n\n## Airdrop\n\nThe goal of the Stargaze airdrop is to reach the most active participants in the Cosmos ecosystem. Stakers and liquidity providers are more likely to be more active than just token holders. Therefore, Stargaze is doing its airdrop to a mix of network participants:\n\n* **ATOM stakers**\n* **OSMO stakers or liquidity providers**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Cosmos Hub**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Osmosis**\n* **Stargaze validator delegators on Regen Network**\n\nFor each role above, you will be able to claim **2,478 STARS**. Distributing a fixed amount is in the spirit of the original Uniswap airdrop, giving every user more or less an equal starting point. In order to claim your airdrop, you have to perform 4-5 actions on Stargaze when it launches. If you have used [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) or [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), you’re already familiar with performing tasks to claim tokens. Some claimable actions include bidding on NFTs, staking, and voting in governance.\n\nSome minimums were put in place to prevent dust accounts and those attempting to game airdrops:\n\n* **ATOM staker: 5 ATOM minimum staked**\n* **OSMO staker: 50 OSMO minimum staked**\n\nFurthermore, delegations to centralized exchange validators were excluded.\n\nFor example, if you’re an ATOM staker and OSMO LP, and meet the above minimums, then your airdrop reward is 4,956 STARS.\n\nOsmosis liquidity providers get the airdrop regardless if LP tokens are bonded or not.\n\nAirdrop claimable amounts start decaying 4 months after the launch of the NFT market. The decaying process linearly decreases the claimable amount for another 4 months.\n\n![Airdrop must be claimed to prevent decay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3_QgqhG1LETOtyBdL0a7P.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter the airdrop claim period, unclaimed STARS are sent to the Community Pool.\n\nSnapshots were taken on Oct 11th, 2021 from Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and Regen Network.\n\nTo see how much STARS you’re eligible to claim, please visit <https://stargaze.zone/airdrop>.\n\n***Note: Airdrops won’t be claimable until after Phase 3 of launch. Please see Phase 3 below.***\n\nhttp://stargaze.zone/airdrop\n\n## Reward Distribution\n\nNew token reward distribution will be optimized to facilitate the operations of the NFT market.\n\nThe initial breakdown per block will be:\n\n![Per block distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UzjJ1v4qZ-bF5zw1BY9kr.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAll chain parameters can be changed via governance vote. Everything suggested in this post are sensible defaults. We expect governance to adapt and change the protocol as it matures.\n\n### NFT Incentives\n\n45% of block rewards are set aside for NFT bidding and staking incentives. Token holders will be able to earn yield by bidding and staking on NFTs for certain periods of time. An upcoming post will outline this mechanic in detail.\n\nIf governance determines that NFT incentives are too high for achieving the desired effect of the protocol, they may direct these incentives towards the Community Pool where they can be spent later.\n\n### Staking Rewards\n\nAs per the course with proof-of-stake networks, validators (node operators) earn rewards for securing the network. They also accept delegations from token holders, and charge a commission of 5% or greater for providing the service.\n\nNearly 100 validators were selected to join mainnet after 3 testnets, 2 of which were incentivized. They will earn 35% of all block rewards.\n\n### Developer Rewards\n\nInitially, 15% of block rewards will go to fund the team that contributes to the development of Stargaze. Each account gets a specific weight set by governance. When a developer is no longer contributing, governance can choose to modify their weight or remove their allocation.\n\n### Community Pool\n\nThe Community Pool is the main DAO that operates the network. It is responsible for voting on parameter changes, software upgrades, community matters, and more. It will receive 5% of all block rewards.\n\n## Phased Launch\n\nSince Stargaze is a layer 1 blockchain with many moving parts, it will launch in phases.\n\n* **Phase 0: Chain launch with 0% inflation (Oct 29th)**\n* **Phase 1: Liquidity pools on [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and [Gravity DEX](https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/)**\n* **Phase 2: Governance proposal to enable inflation**\n* **Phase 3: Web app launch with first NFT drop**\n\nMore details about the liquidity pools will be forthcoming. Please follow us on social media (links below) for updates. They are planned for 2-3 weeks after Phase 0, and have to go through governance to be funded via the Community Pool.\n\nNew tokens won’t be issued until after Phase 2, when inflation kicks in. At this time you’ll be able to stake STARS at [stargaze.zone](http://stargaze.zone/) via [Keplr Wallet](http://keplr.app/).\n\nPhase 3 is expected to be completed before the end of the year. Airdrops will be claimable starting in this phase.\n\n## Follow Us\n\nTo follow along with Stargaze developments, check us out on Twitter at <https://twitter.com/StargazeZone>, and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StargazeZone\n\n[https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE)\n\nHappy Stargazing ✨🔭", "timestamp": 1635202123, "digest": "h9Bc7jODUrYB1Jw4mve3QEGVkBwBsyVebN6NP7tRl_Y", "contributor": "0x57a9Cb03cC8Ed919162d9024710ca9E886346299"}

期权市场规模和未来发展趋势\n\n1、2020年是期权市场的元年。期权市场仍处于早期阶段，增速迅猛\n\n2020年期权成交量在衍生品总交易量占比约0.62%，尚处早期。全年期权交易量增幅达到487%\n\n2、期权交易业务主要分布在中心化交易所，且Deribit作为头部力量，占全年期权交易量的84%;其中Deribit交易所集中了大量机构投资者，而期权业务规模较小的交易所多以个人投资者为主。\n\n3、期权交易所类型\n\n期权交易所分类为传统期权交易所、新兴期权交易所、合规期权交易所、奇异期权交易所、去中心化交易所共五类。去年的期权交易量增速主要在中心化交易所。\n\n4、奇异期权进入数字资产期权市场\n\n2020年，奇异期权(Exotic Options)产品开始进入数字资产期权市场。奇异期权是比传统期权(标准的欧式或美式期权)更为复杂的投资衍生品，经营奇异期权业务的交易所主要包括Binance与FTX两家。分别为二元期权(Binary options)、跨式期权(Straddle)等\n\n5、去中心化期权交易所处于探索阶段，当前TVL占比衍生品赛道约为4.26%\n\n目前，链上期权产品仍处于探索阶段，由于期权的专业性和高风险性，从锁仓量角度看，去中心化交易所的锁仓量依然相对较低（2020年所有去中心化交易所总锁仓量仅为4.728亿美元，今年总锁仓量在）\n\n6、回归分析洞察\n\n（1）相较于比特币币价，期货与现货的历史波动率对期权交易量影响更大，其影响力超出比特币价格影响力逾千倍。\n\n（3）期货市场的波动对期权市场交易量的影响相对高于现货市场，这表明期货投资者更倾向于在投资组合中配置期权，用以对冲可能的市场风险。\n\n（3）期货交易量与前一天的BTC期权权利金额之间存在着显著联系，BTC期权权利金额的变动方向往往预示着第二天期货市场交易量的变动方向。\n\n**机构型、对冲型和结构化产品的参与者将会继续入场。去中心化期权市场、以及结构化衍生品会和整个DeFi行业一起成长。**\n\n![数据来源：《2020

一、期权产品类型\n\n一份期权具有以下信息：资产类别、行权日、行权价格、数量\n\n从期权属性划分，可以分为标准型期权和非标准化期权。\n\n（1）**标准型期权**：欧式和美式期权/看跌和看涨期权\n\n**美式期权**是指可以在成交后有效期内任何一天被执行的期权。\n\n**欧式期权**是指只有在合约到期日才被允许执行的期权。\n\n特点：标准化、交易活跃、由交易所或者经纪人报价，一般在自由市场内交易。交易量占优势\n\n（2）非标准化期权：包括奇异期权等\n\n特点：高收益、场外交易，有一系列的规定合同，交易金额较大。\n\n去中心化期权交易所中的期权产品多为可以随时行权的美式期权，如Hegic。目前也出现了部分欧式期权，如opyn。中心化交易所一般都是欧式期权。 \n \n\n### 二、中心化期权参与主体和清结算形式\n\n**1、交易所**\n\n提供交易场所，进行期权的发行和撮合交易，交易所实质上扮演了资金和信用的供给方。它为双方提供了履约信用，并且监督资金的转移符合市场规则：\n\n期权卖方——缴纳保证金——交易所账户——交易所账户根据市场价动态调整保证金要求；\n\n期权买方——缴纳权利金——交易所账户——交易所将权利金交给卖方。\n\n**2、期权清算公司**\n\n在传统金融，交易所内进行交易的期权需要通过**同一家公司进行结算；**对于数字货币期权，不同于token可以任意市场交易，期权基本都属于各家交易所自行交易清算，不能跨市场交易和清算。\n\n**3、投资者结构**\n\n**（1）期权交易商**\n\n有做市商、场内交易经纪人和场外交易经纪人\n\n**（2）投资者**\n\n期权买方和卖方。主要有以下几种特征：\n\n投机者：方向性预测或波动率预测，组合策略。\n\n套期保值者：规避自身资产价格波动带来的风险，类似保险的功能。\n\n套利者：同时进入两个或多个市场交易，以锁定无风险收益\n\n### 三、去中心化期权参与主体和清结算形式\n\n**1、去中心化期权交易所的流动性池机制**\n\n**（1）期权买方**\n\n看涨期权合约赋予买方（**持有人**）在特定固定期限内以指定价格购买标的资产的权利。看跌期权合约赋予买方（持有人）在特定固定期限内以指定价格出售标的资产的权利。期权买方通过支付期权费（权利金）获得在期限内以指定交割交易标的资产的权利。\n\n**（2）期权卖方**\n\n期权卖方首先要抵押资产，才能铸造期权代币。抵押资产充当传统期权市场中的保证金，**保证金以支付行权日当天，期权买方行权时，其价差的转移。**\n\n**（3）期权合约+资金池充当中心化交易所和清算公司职能**\n\n期权卖方——抵押资产——放入保证金池——合约根据市场价动态调整保证金要求——write 期权；\n\n期权买方——缴纳权利金——放入权利金收益池——合约将权利金转给卖方——行权时现金结算\n\n**2、期权清算**\n\n（1）期权行权或者到期正常清算\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s6AHSXD112d2UBaIID_yl.png?height=386&width=2096)\n\n（2）保证金不足强行清算：\n\n以FinNexus的清算机制为例，其最低保证金是变化的：与底层资产的行权价格、市场价、行权数量有关，且要求：\n\n1、抵押率=抵押品价值/最低保证金要求（SP的函数-M保证金）\n\n2、最低保证金要求，事实上远高于【行权日当天的价差转移保证合同行使最低价值】\n\n清算比率 = 必须维持以避免潜在清算的最低抵押比率（设置为 100%） ；抵押率大于等于1\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dR5YkQMl3v3J9ZC39SM8Q.png?height=554&width=1162)\n\n例如，当以SP=3000，卖出2个ETH看涨期权，最少需要保证金=（未来市场价-行权价）\\*行权量2\n\n当市场价格达到1.3SP，履行合同至少需要保证金为0.3SP/张，根据函数此时最低保证金要求为0.5SP/张，即总共最低保证金要求为0.5SP\\*2，假定现在抵押品价值为0.6SP，抵押率小于1，开始清算。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SfYQXwgyrbXTpXTIGO4PM.png?height=648&width=2114)\n\n假设清算量为m张，扣除价值为=0.3SP\\*m+0.3SP\\*2\\*20%\n\n即\\[0.8SP -（0.3SP\\*m+0.12SP）\\]/0.5SP\\*(2-m)=1  解m=1.6  \n\n如果保证金充足，抵押品仅为扣除为0.3SP\\*1.6， 0.48SP，而清算过程实际扣除0.6SP \n \n\n**3、期权结算方式**\n\n1、实物结算\n\n如果是实物交割，相当于发行一张ETH期权，至少需要抵押一个ETH用于未来的行权，但实际上行权时利润的转移仅为价差。如果实物结算完全按照行权规则，互相转移底层标的资产，资金利用率较差，gas费也较高。\n\n2、现金结算\n\n薪金结算意味着期权持有人在行权时，不需要交换标的资产，只需要结算利润即可，大大提升资本效率。 行权价与标的资产市值的价差将通过智能合约直接转入期权持有人的地址。一般都采取这一形式。\n\n## 三、链上期权项目分析\n\n### HEGIC\n\n是利用利用流动性池和对冲合约实现的链上美式期权交易平台。\n\n**官网：<https://www.hegic.co/>**\n\n**市场规模**：DeFi锁仓46名；期权市场锁仓量第一名；\n\n当前总锁仓金额为0.48亿，约占期权交易市场的45% <https://www.defipulse.com/hegic>\n\n**数据表现**：<https://duneanalytics.com/slash125/hegic-v2>\n\nHegic期权二级市场交易：未开放二级市场交易 <https://hetoro.com/h2m/>\n\n**Hegic 工作原理说明**\n\n三种角色，期权买家是holders：期权卖方用户称为writer；目前Hegic提供了ETH、WBTC资产的看空期权和看涨期权。\n\n**1、期权买方**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gQ8pbmGLY0d9MBiVo4RnW.png?height=1338&width=2124)\n\n(1)期权的买家与hegic的合约进行交互, 自定义参数(用户可以任意定制)(行权价, 行权日), 则可以购入期权代币, 即HEGIC 币.\n\n(2)在行权日之前, 如果期权买方盈余, 则可以行使期权，让合约回收HEGIC代币, 并获得盈利额(市价和行权价的差额)\n\n**2、期权卖方——流动性提供方**\n\n对于期权卖方而言，有两个流动性提供池：ETH和WBTC，分别支撑ETH与WBTC的期权。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y2-A_VVUcqV9NePs0bUtf.png?height=1192&width=2084)\n\n期权卖家用户, 如果想售卖ETH的看涨/看跌期权, 则将ETH资产抵押入ETH抵押品池子(这笔资产会被锁定14天), 同时将获得writeETH 代币， 期权的卖家想回收资产,  且其资产未被锁定满足回收资产的条件, 则可以调用合约的提取方法,销毁自己的writeDAI或者writeETH，合约会计算你在提供流动性期间的收益率并返回相应数量的资产。\n\n在向流动性池发送ETH或者WBTC后，writeASSET 代币将被铸造并发送到流动性提供方的地址。writeETH 代币的铸造公式是：𝛥𝑊=𝑊∗𝛥𝑃 /𝑃\n\n𝛥𝑊 = 其中ΔW –流动性提供者将收到的 writeETH 代币数量；ΔP –流动性提供者提供给矿池的 ETH 代币数量；W –已经分发的 writeETH 代币总量；P –提供给矿池的 ETH代币总量。\n\n提供流动性后，Writter将开始分享池子的premium。（将从下一个买入对冲合约的人赚取回报。之前期权的溢价或损失将不会分配给这个新的流动性提供者）。\n\n**3、期权交易过程**\n\n期权买方买入ETH看涨期权，缴纳premium10美金——premium发送到收益池——锁定流动池内相应行权数量的ETH——期权买方收到相应的Hegic，并且能够在持有期间的任何时候行使该期权合约（根据市场价格结算价差）。同时池子流动性提供者共同承担相应的亏损。结算通过利用uniswap，直接换算为等值的ETH，结算价差。\n\n**Hegic优劣势分析**\n\n**优势**\n\n1、对于卖方而言, 卖期权只涉及到一笔transaction, 即抵押资产, 相比于其他期权产品需要铸币, 添加流动性或在现货池交易, 这种方式更加节省手续费, 并且方便散户充当期权卖方\n\n2、期权卖方, 所有LP共同承担损失, 降低了期权卖方个体的风险；\n\n3、由于所有期权卖方用户, 共同提供流动性, 期权买方可以定制化期权参数(行权价行权日), 都能买到期权, 对于买方而言更加灵活。\n\n**劣势**\n\n1. 对于卖方而言, 缺乏灵活性, 无法选择要卖出的期权产品的参数(行权日, 行权价等), 因此对于卖方而言, 缺乏对冲风险的手段。本质上LP的收益是由期权买方的判断来决定的\n\n2、期权凭证相互之间不能自由流通, 由于Hegic的期权信息都不一样，买方买入期权后得到HEGIC代币后, 只能用于自己行权，不能相互交易。\n\n### Opyn\n\n**官网：<https://v1.opyn.co/#/>**\n\n**<https://v2.opyn.co/#/>**\n\n**市场规模**：当前总锁仓金额为0.38亿，是期权赛道第二大锁仓量\n\n[https://www.defipulse.com/opyn](https://www.defipulse.com/opyn)\n\n**1、opyn v1 目前锁仓金额仅为1.3M**\n\nOpyn 主要是通过**欧式期权**为用户提供对冲和类似保险服务 UNI。\n\n当前主要是通过买入保护性UNI看跌期权，对冲币种下行等风险。其行权价格、行权时间都是平台确定的。**为标准化欧式期权。**\n\n（1）期权买方选项\n\n低价格（25）的看跌期权；高价格（32）的看涨期权\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I1WBpqT5HXHqmPUeJE6bA.png?height=746&width=2164)\n\n由于是标准化的期权，因此可以可以在uniswap上以一定价格Premium（现价为2.75$）购买到 oUNIP，并且在行权到期前oToken都可以在uniswap上自由交易。行权日当天，如果UNI价格低于25$，就可以发送你的UNI和oUNIP到合约履行期权，收到25USDC/UNI。\n\n（2）期权卖方选项\n\n低价格（25）的看跌期权 ；高价格（32）的看涨期权\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yew24uPCZHVyHxu7DUkQI.png?height=1032&width=1996)\n\n页面显示了期权卖方年预测ROI和Premium/USDC抵押品：\n\n存入一定的抵押品USDC，然后就可以铸造相应的看跌期权oUNIP，同种oUNIP 可以在Uniswap上自由交易。同时根据抵押品份额享受Premium的收益，但是如果有人行权，即未来价格跌至25以下，需要承担相应比例的亏损。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ltAAMqp31ioO4B44VJK1Q.png?height=1318&width=2112)\n\n**2、opyn v2 目前锁仓金额为37M——主体**\n\nV2是通过0x trading Protocol实现oToken交易的。通过bid(sell)&ask（buy），得到/支付平台给定的premium价格。\n\n期权类型：WETH和WBTC两类看涨看跌期权；行权日是每个月11号与25号；其行权价格是平台确定的几个具体价格，**有11种标准化欧式期权。**\n\n**（1）Bid**\n\n抵押资产（卖出看涨抵押1个WETH，卖出看跌抵押行权价值的USDC）——铸造出期权代币oToken——允许oToken进入0x交易合约——卖出oToken\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1T1meh_XROIIQ8VdiIh7Y.png?height=1320&width=1982)\n\n**（2）Ask**\n\n对于期权买方，USDC缴纳期权费，购买1 oToken后，可在行权日，凭借oToken在协议中进行行权，以现金的方式收回利润。其中，每个不同的期权产品铸造出的oToken均不同。对于买方来说代表着行权的权利，对于卖方来说代表着行权的义务或分享收益的权利。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zmHvEmEob8GCHzS7EMqK9.png?height=1326&width=1990)\n\n**3、特点：Opyn优化期权的流动性**\n\n期权产品比较特殊，不同的行权价和行权日，会得到不同的期权费，由于期权种类比较多，每个单一的期权的交易流动性就会比较差，Opyn通过差价期权的方式进行流动性的改进。\n\n具体设计：对于期权卖方而言，与其用足额保证金来铸造出期权oToken，可以选择差价期权的方式来铸造oToken。例如，足额保证金的情况下，需要花100USDC铸造出1个ETH-USDC-100 Put，然而，**用差价期权的方式，可以先买入1个ETH-USDC-50 PUT，然后只需要花50USDC作为保证金就可以铸造出1个ETH-USDC-100 Put**\n\n**（此时ETH-USDC-50 已经有人提供了50USDC抵押金额，购买50put token大约在10$，这样操作的成本远小于100USDC的抵押金额，从而提高了期权的流动性）**\n\n### Ribbon Finance\n\n**官网：<https://app.ribbon.finance/>**\n\n**市场规模**：当前总锁仓金额为0.33亿，是期权赛道第三大锁仓量。\n\n**<https://www.defipulse.com/ribbon-finance>**\n\n**介绍：**“第一个致力于为DeFi市场提供结构性产品的项目。构建可以通过跨协议（主要是和Hegic和Opyn）组合创建的新金融产品，以帮助用户获得比他们自己所能实现的更高的风险回报率。”\n\n它提出了结构化存款产品，保证到期时按照面值支付给持有人，并通过长期看涨期权带来额外回报**将零息债券和一种资产的长期看涨期权相结合。**\n\n（1）从单一期权策略到**token+期权对冲收益**聚合策略\n\nRibbon提供的第一个产品是一种被称为”Strangle”的波动性策略。Strangle是一种期权策略，即在同一期限内以不同的执行价格同时买入价外（OTM）看涨期权和看跌期权。经验丰富的期权交易员和DeFi用户可以自己执行此策略，但是Ribbon通过使用Hegic和Opyn根据交易规模找到最便宜的链上价格来为投资者打包这一策略。鉴于部署这一策略时，以太坊网络的Gas费用很高，因此该团队决定停止提供该产品，并将其工作重点放在提高收益率的产品上，推出了两个资管产品。\n\n（2）资管：Theta vaults和Puts Theta Vault\n\n**资管产品Theta Vault** 是一个专注于 ETH 和 BTC 的收益策略，**运行 Covered Call 策略。**Covered call= Long Stock + Short Call\\*\\*，指同时买入一份token和卖出一份call（看涨期权），**这适合不会出现大幅度暴跌的优质标的，略微看涨。**要选择足够接近市场价格的行权价，确保最大限度的溢价获取。\n\nRibbon Finance决定行权价格和行权日。实行这一机制的原因是，个人在链上采取这种策略会非常困难。Ribbon Finance与Opyn合作铸造oToken，然后与做市商（链下，采取预言机）合作，将oToken交换为WETH。这意味着Ribbon vault能够以WETH的形式收取溢价，而做市商以oToken的形式收取溢价。随着项目的成熟和发展，这个“管理者”的角色将被下放到社区中，提供新的方式来处理协议。\n\n![Covered Call                                                           Short Put](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ftsJsFz1R6jY-Olwqm4ki.png?height=884&width=2236)\n\n资管产品**Puts Theta Vault**\n\n**Puts Theta Vault 出售看跌期权，运行 Short Put 策略。**用户只需将 USDC 存入智能合约，Ribbon每周自动完成该期权策略。Ribbon 计划之后将会提供以 ETH 或 WBTC 等非 USDC 资产抵押的 Puts Theta Vaults。用户只需要将资产存入智能合约，就会**自动开始运行特定的期权策略，减轻了 Gas 费用过高的问题。**\n\n该资金库通过运行一个自动策略，抵押USDC，**出售ETH价外看跌期权。**该资金库每周在Opyn上出售OTM看跌期权，获取溢价并每周进行再投资，以获得复合收益率。如果期权到期，资金库有义务以预先确定的执行价格购买标的资产，即“逢低买入”。最大的利润被预先定义为收到的premium。**适用于长期看涨某项资产、希望逢低买入的人。价值投资。**",

"本文先从期权市场规模和宏观市场结构出发，判断链上期权的发展趋势和潜在规模。然后对比传统期权和链上期权的产品类型、参与主体、清结算方式的异同点，了解链上期权的优势和当下的痛点。最后深度分析了三个链上项目：Hegic、Opyn、Ribbon，分别代表了美式期权、欧式期权和基于期权产品的结构化金融协议。\n\n## 期权市场规模和未来发展趋势\n\n1、2020年是期权市场的元年。期权市场仍处于早期阶段，增速迅猛\n\n2020年期权成交量在衍生品总交易量占比约0.62%，尚处早期。全年期权交易量增幅达到487%\n\n2、期权交易业务主要分布在中心化交易所，且Deribit作为头部力量，占全年期权交易量的84%;其中Deribit交易所集中了大量机构投资者，而期权业务规模较小的交易所多以个人投资者为主。\n\n3、期权交易所类型\n\n期权交易所分类为传统期权交易所、新兴期权交易所、合规期权交易所、奇异期权交易所、去中心化交易所共五类。去年的期权交易量增速主要在中心化交易所。\n\n4、奇异期权进入数字资产期权市场\n\n2020年，奇异期权(Exotic Options)产品开始进入数字资产期权市场。奇异期权是比传统期权(标准的欧式或美式期权)更为复杂的投资衍生品，经营奇异期权业务的交易所主要包括Binance与FTX两家。分别为二元期权(Binary options)、跨式期权(Straddle)等\n\n5、去中心化期权交易所处于探索阶段，当前TVL占比衍生品赛道约为4.26%\n\n目前，链上期权产品仍处于探索阶段，由于期权的专业性和高风险性，从锁仓量角度看，去中心化交易所的锁仓量依然相对较低。目前市场上大致可以分为两类：底层期权产品；期权衍生品即结构性金融产品，后者能够很好助推前者的发展。\n\n6、回归分析洞察\n\n期货市场的波动对期权市场交易量的影响相对高于现货市场，这表明期货投资者更倾向于在投资组合中配置期权，用以对冲可能的市场风险。\n\n**机构型、对冲型和结构化产品的参与者将会继续入场。去中心化期权市场、以及结构化衍生品会和整个DeFi行业一起成长。**\n\n![数据来源：《2020 年度数字资产期权交易行业研究报告 》](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SsHvyRUt8GXxczfWGCvv6.png?height=458&width=2208)\n\n## 链上期权和传统中心化期权的对比\n\n### 一、期权产品类型\n\n一份期权具有以下信息：资产类别、行权日、行权价格、数量\n\n从期权属性划分，可以分为标准型期权和非标准化期权。\n\n（1）**标准型期权**：欧式和美式期权/看跌和看涨期权\n\n**美式期权**是指可以在成交后有效期内任何一天被执行的期权。\n\n**欧式期权**是指只有在合约到期日才被允许执行的期权。\n\n特点：标准化、交易活跃、由交易所或者经纪人报价，一般在自由市场内交易。交易量占优势\n\n（2）非标准化期权：包括奇异期权等\n\n特点：高收益、场外交易，有一系列的规定合同，交易金额较大。\n\n去中心化期权交易所中的期权产品多为可以随时行权的美式期权，如Hegic。目前也出现了部分欧式期权，如opyn。中心化交易所一般都是欧式期权。\n\n### 二、中心化期权参与主体和清结算形式\n\n**1、交易所**\n\n提供交易场所，进行期权的发行和撮合交易，交易所实质上扮演了资金和信用的供给方。它为双方提供了履约信用，并且监督资金的转移符合市场规则：\n\n期权卖方——缴纳保证金——交易所账户——交易所账户根据市场价动态调整保证金要求；\n\n期权买方——缴纳权利金——交易所账户——交易所将权利金交给卖方。\n\n**2、期权清算公司**\n\n在传统金融，交易所内进行交易的期权需要通过\\*\\*同一家公司进行结算；\\*\\*对于数字货币期权，不同于token可以任意市场交易，期权基本都属于各家交易所自行交易清算，不能跨市场交易和清算。\n\n**3、投资者结构**\n\n**（1）期权交易商**\n\n有做市商、场内交易经纪人和场外交易经纪人\n\n**（2）投资者**\n\n期权买方和卖方。主要有以下几种特征：\n\n投机者：方向性预测或波动率预测，组合策略。\n\n套期保值者：规避自身资产价格波动带来的风险，类似保险的功能。\n\n套利者：同时进入两个或多个市场交易，以锁定无风险收益\n\n### 三、去中心化期权参与主体和清结算形式\n\n**1、去中心化期权交易所的流动性池机制**\n\n**（1）期权买方**\n\n看涨期权合约赋予买方（**持有人**）在特定固定期限内以指定价格购买标的资产的权利。看跌期权合约赋予买方（持有人）在特定固定期限内以指定价格出售标的资产的权利。期权买方通过支付期权费（权利金）获得在期限内以指定交割交易标的资产的权利。\n\n**（2）期权卖方**\n\n期权卖方首先要抵押资产，才能铸造期权代币。抵押资产充当传统期权市场中的保证金，**保证金以支付行权日当天，期权买方行权时，其价差的转移。**\n\n**（3）期权合约+资金池充当中心化交易所和清算公司职能**\n\n*

0.48SP，而清算过程实际扣除0.6SP\n\n**3、期权结算方式**\n\n1、实物结算\n\n如果是实物交割，相当于发行一张ETH期权，至少需要抵押一个ETH用于未来的行权，但实际上行权时利润的转移仅为价差。如果实物结算完全按照行权规则，互相转移底层标的资产，资金利用率较差，gas费也较高。\n\n2、现金结算\n\n薪金结算意味着期权持有人在行权时，不需要交换标的资产，只需要结算利润即可，大大提升资本效率。 行权价与标的资产市值的价差将通过智能合约直接转入期权持有人的地址。一般都采取这一形式。\n\n## 三、链上期权项目分析\n\n### HEGIC\n\n是利用利用流动性池和对冲合约实现的链上美式期权交易平台。\n\n**官网：<https://www.hegic.co/>**\n\n**市场规模**：DeFi锁仓46名；期权市场锁仓量第一名；\n\n当前总锁仓金额为0.48亿，约占期权交易市场的45% <https://www.defipulse.com/hegic>\n\n**数据表现**：<https://duneanalytics.com/slash125/hegic-v2>\n\nHegic期权二级市场交易：未开放二级市场交易 <https://hetoro.com/h2m/>\n\n**Hegic 工作原理说明**\n\n三种角色，期权买家是holders：期权卖方用户称为writer；目前Hegic提供了ETH、WBTC资产的看空期权和看涨期权。\n\n**1、期权买方**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gQ8pbmGLY0d9MBiVo4RnW.png?height=1338&width=2124)\n\n(1)期权的买家与hegic的合约进行交互, 自定义参数(用户可以任意定制)(行权价, 行权日), 则可以购入期权代币, 即HEGIC 币.\n\n(2)在行权日之前, 如果期权买方盈余, 则可以行使期权，让合约回收HEGIC代币, 并获得盈利额(市价和行权价的差额)\n\n**2、期权卖方——流动性提供方**\n\n对于期权卖方而言，有两个流动性提供池：ETH和WBTC，分别支撑ETH与WBTC的期权。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y2-A_VVUcqV9NePs0bUtf.png?height=1192&width=2084)\n\n期权卖家用户, 如果想售卖ETH的看涨/看跌期权, 则将ETH资产抵押入ETH抵押品池子(这笔资产会被锁定14天), 同时将获得writeETH 代币， 期权的卖家想回收资产,  且其资产未被锁定满足回收资产的条件, 则可以调用合约的提取方法,销毁自己的writeDAI或者writeETH，合约会计算你在提供流动性期间的收益率并返回相应数量的资产。\n\n在向流动性池发送ETH或者WBTC后，writeASSET 代币将被铸造并发送到流动性提供方的地址。writeETH 代币的铸造公式是：𝛥𝑊=𝑊∗𝛥𝑃 /𝑃\n\n𝛥𝑊 = 其中ΔW –流动性提供者将收到的 writeETH 代币数量；ΔP –流动性提供者提供给矿池的 ETH 代币数量；W –已经分发的 writeETH 代币总量；P –提供给矿池的 ETH代币总量。\n\n提供流动性后，Writter将开始分享池子的premium。（将从下一个买入对冲合约的人赚取回报。之前期权的溢价或损失将不会分配给这个新的流动性提供者）。\n\n**3、期权交易过程**\n\n期权买方买入ETH看涨期权，缴纳premium10美金——premium发送到收益池——锁定流动池内相应行权数量的ETH——期权买方收到相应的Hegic，并且能够在持有期间的任何时候行使该期权合约（根据市场价格结算价差）。同时池子流动性提供者共同承担相应的亏损。结算通过利用uniswap，直接换算为等值的ETH，结算价差。\n\n**Hegic优劣势分析**\n\n**优势**\n\n1、对于卖方而言, 卖期权只涉及到一笔transaction, 即抵押资产, 相比于其他期权产品需要铸币, 添加流动性或在现货池交易, 这种方式更加节省手续费, 并且方便散户充当期权卖方\n\n2、期权卖方, 所有LP共同承担损失, 降低了期权卖方个体的风险；\n\n3、由于所有期权卖方用户, 共同提供流动性, 期权买方可以定制化期权参数(行权价行权日), 都能买到期权, 对于买方而言更加灵活。\n\n**劣势**\n\n1. 对于卖方而言, 缺乏灵活性, 无法选择要卖出的期权产品的参数(行权日, 行权价等), 因此对于卖方而言, 缺乏对冲风险的手段。本质上LP的收益是由期权买方的判断来决定的\n\n2、期权凭证相互之间不能自由流通, 由于Hegic的期权信息都不一样，买方买入期权后得到HEGIC代币后, 只能用于自己行权，不能相互交易。\n\n### Opyn\n\n**官网：<https://v1.opyn.co/#/>**\n\n**<https://v2.opyn.co/#/>**\n\n**市场规模**：当前总锁仓金额为0.38亿，是期权赛道第二大锁仓量\n\n[https://www.defipulse.com/opyn](https://www.defipulse.com/opyn)\n\n**1、opyn v1 目前锁仓金额仅为1.3M**\n\nOpyn 主要是通过**欧式期权**为用户提供对冲和类似保险服务 UNI。\n\n当前主要是通过买入保护性UNI看跌期权，对冲币种下行等风险。其行权价格、行权时间都是平台确定的。**为标准化欧式期权。**\n\n（1）期权买方选项\n\n低价格（25）的看跌期权；高价格（32）的看涨期权\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I1WBpqT5HXHqmPUeJE6bA.png?height=746&width=2164)\n\n由于是标准化的期权，因此可以可以在uniswap上以一定价格Premium（现价为2.75$）购买到 oUNIP，并且在行权到期前oToken都可以在uniswap上自由交易。行权日当天，如果UNI价格低于25$，就可以发送你的UNI和oUNIP到合约履行期权，收到25USDC/UNI。\n\n（2）期权卖方选项\n\n低价格（25）的看跌期权 ；高价格（32）的看涨期权\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yew24uPCZHVyHxu7DUkQI.png?height=1032&width=1996)\n\n页面显示了期权卖方年预测ROI和Premium/USDC抵押品：\n\n存入一定的抵押品USDC，然后就可以铸造相应的看跌期权oUNIP，同种oUNIP 可以在Uniswap上自由交易。同时根据抵押品份额享受Premium的收益，但是如果有人行权，即未来价格跌至25以下，需要承担相应比例的亏损。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ltAAMqp31ioO4B44VJK1Q.png?height=1318&width=2112)\n\n**2、opyn v2 目前锁仓金额为37M——主体**\n\nV2是通过0x trading Protocol实现oToken交易的。通过bid(sell)&ask（buy），得到/支付平台给定的premium价格。\n\n期权类型：WETH和WBTC两类看涨看跌期权；行权日是每个月11号与25号；其行权价格是平台确定的几个具体价格，**有11种标准化欧式期权。**\n\n**（1）Bid**\n\n抵押资产（卖出看涨抵押1个WETH，卖出看跌抵押行权价值的USDC）——铸造出期权代币oToken——允许oToken进入0x交易合约——卖出oToken\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1T1meh_XROIIQ8VdiIh7Y.png?height=1320&width=1982)\n\n**（2）Ask**\n\n对于期权买方，USDC缴纳期权费，购买1 oToken后，可在行权日，凭借oToken在协议中进行行权，以现金的方式收回利润。其中，每个不同的期权产品铸造出的oToken均不同。对于买方来说代表着行权的权利，对于卖方来说代表着行权的义务或分享收益的权利。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zmHvEmEob8GCHzS7EMqK9.png?height=1326&width=1990)\n\n**3、特点：Opyn优化期权的流动性**\n\n期权产品比较特殊，不同的行权价和行权日，会得到不同的期权费，由于期权种类比较多，每个单一的期权的交易流动性就会比较差，Opyn通过差价期权的方式进行流动性的改进。\n\n具体设计：对于期权卖方而言，与其用足额保证金来铸造出期权oToken，可以选择差价期权的方式来铸造oToken。例如，足额保证金的情况下，需要花100USDC铸造出1个ETH-USDC-100 Put，然而，**用差价期权的方式，可以先买入1个ETH-USDC-50 PUT，然后只需要花50USDC作为保证金就可以铸造出1个ETH-USDC-100 Put**\n\n**（此时ETH-USDC-50 已经有人提供了50USDC抵押金额，购买50put token大约在10$，这样操作的成本远小于100USDC的抵押金额，从而提高了期权的流动性）**\n\n### Ribbon Finance\n\n**官网：<https://app.ribbon.finance/>**\n\n**市场规模**：当前总锁仓金额为0.33亿，是期权赛道第三大锁仓量。\n\n**<https://www.defipulse.com/ribbon-finance>**\n\n**介绍：**“第一个致力于为DeFi市场提供结构性产品的项目。构建可以通过跨协议（主要是和Hegic和Opyn）组合创建的新金融产品，以帮助用户获得比他们自己所能实现的更高的风险回报率。”\n\n它提出了结构化存款产品，保证到期时按照面值支付给持有人，并通过长期看涨期权带来额外回报**将零息债券和一种资产的长期看涨期权相结合。**\n\n（1）从单一期权策略到**token+期权对冲收益**聚合策略\n\nRibbon提供的第一个产品是一种被称为”Strangle”的波动性策略。Strangle是一种期权策略，即在同一期限内以不同的执行价格同时买入价外（OTM）看涨期权和看跌期权。经验丰富的期权交易员和DeFi用户可以自己执行此策略，但是Ribbon通过使用Hegic和Opyn根据交易规模找到最便宜的链上价格来为投资者打包这一策略。鉴于部署这一策略时，以太坊网络的Gas费用很高，因此该团队决定停止提供该产品，并将其工作重点放在提高收益率的产品上，推出了两个资管产品。\n\n（2）资管：Theta vaults和Puts Theta Vault\n\n**资管产品Theta Vault** 是一个专注于 ETH 和 BTC 的收益策略，\\*\\*运行 Covered Call 策略。\\*\\*Covered call= Long Stock + Short Call\\*\\*，指同时买入一份token和卖出一份call（看涨期权），\\*\\*这适合不会出现大幅度暴跌的优质标的，略微看涨。\\*\\*要选择足够接近市场价格的行权价，确保最大限度的溢价获取。\n\nRibbon Finance决定行权价格和行权日。实行这一机制的原因是，个人在链上采取这种策略会非常困难。Ribbon Finance与Opyn合作铸造oToken，然后与做市商（链下，采取预言机）合作，将oToken交换为WETH。这意味着Ribbon vault能够以WETH的形式收取溢价，而做市商以oToken的形式收取溢价。随着项目的成熟和发展，这个“管理者”的角色将被下放到社区中，提供新的方式来处理协议。\n\n![Covered Call

Short Put 策略。用户只需将 USDC 存入智能合约，Ribbon每周自动完成该期权策略。Ribbon 计划之后将会提供以 ETH 或 WBTC 等非 USDC 资产抵押的 Puts Theta Vaults。用户只需要将资产存入智能合约，就会**自动开始运行特定的期权策略，减轻了 Gas

Shelled within, we all have parts of us that frighten, parts that we run from, and parts that we jail because we are too scared to let the world see. We’re afraid of letting our guard down, so we put up walls, stacking them up so high, hoping no one sees what is underneath the armour. We are constantly ignoring its existence and everything around us nurtures our ego creating the illusion that we have to be perfect. We focus on the wondrous beauty of the flower, yet forget the rough journey of the stem and root. We forbid ourselves vulnerability, allowing ourselves to be crippled by our fears and restrain the flow of authentic connections with others.\n\n \n\nThere is purpose in pain, meaning in the mess, and beauty in your brokenness. You are art, a mosaic, an array of splintered pieces put together to create a picture. Your picture. A work of art so powerful, unique, and briefly wonderful. It’s these so called broken pieces that no longer poke at one’s sides, but forcefully demand that we breathe, reflect, and grow. In doing so, we can free ourselves from the craving to have control over the things we can’t change and embrace our scars as a series of beauty marks.

Join the discord [here](https://discord.com/invite/Mxb9jWekFV), or get full access to the game and future additions by purchasing a [manny on Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/mannys-game)!\n\n## 💙 a community built on trust\n\nManny is no stranger to the world of gaming, and his vision to inspire other creators with his 3D NFT characters has created a powerful cultural movement within web3. The foundation of mannys.game is simple enough: **trust**. This core tenet enables folks to build openly and share information with each other in hopes of creating a better future together. While the web3 world runs on permissionless code, its community trust is what creates value. The goofy 3D avatars of mannys.game reflect this; without trust, the scope of this game would have remained completely limited.\n\n## 🎨 a little background\n\nManny has been a software engineer for over a decade, and entered the crypto scene in 2017 through friends dedicated to the degen life. Witnessing the bull-run that occurred (Bitcoin grew from \\~$1,000 (USD) to \\~$20,000 (USD) in the same year!), he knew something special was brewing, and wanted to be a part of it.\n\nWith an interest in design, new media, VR and conceptual art, he started making web projects on the side to practice various skills to bring his experiments to life.\n\nIn 2018, he attended the [Ethereal Arts Summit](https://www.etherealsummit.com/arts), and shortly after, got his body 3D scanned. He started using his 3D avatar to create gifs and stickers on [Giphy](https://giphy.com/mannynotfound), reaching over 590+ million people with his delightful animations.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NQc9R8O2hWrrmWVetA0Na.gif?height=279&width=420)\n\nIn 2020 when the NFT craze began, Manny knew he wanted to combine his cauldron of ideas and experiments to utilize this new technology to its fullest potential, and push the frontier of what NFTs could do.\n\n## 🕹 mannys.game\n\nStarting off as a way to learn to more about [smart contracts](https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts), [ERC tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/#introduction), and the world of [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/), he quickly realized he wanted to build a project that would inspire other creators and push the frontier of what NFTs could do. He didn’t want to do the same static NFT project, but wanted to create something dynamic and everlasting, complete with his own mischievous twist. As an avid fan of video games and trading cards, he strove to combine the feeling of opening a random pack of trading cards with the idea of getting access to a digital kingdom.\n\nThe original idea was simple – mint between 1-4 random mannys of various rarity, and trade with others in the game to collect one of each type (60% of each trade would go towards a community pot). Once you had one of each kind, you could call the contract function mintGoldManny() to claim the juicy reward and win the [shiny 1/1 golden manny](https://opensea.io/assets/0x2bd58a19c7e4abf17638c5ee6fa96ee5eb53aed9/404).\n\n![types of mannys you could get from mint](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g1GmTRYm3tIh_dOsgBz5q.png?height=323&width=1456&&&&&&&&&&size=large)\n\n![24 karats](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/u4ZAsuXYrbgoGsIMkAwg-.png?height=1090&width=1022)\n\nManny launched the game initially thinking the community would be competitive to keep the pot for themselves, but @[nasjaq](https://twitter.com/nasjaq__) and a few others players (initially all strangers) proved him wrong by teaming up to trade their rare mannys and split the pot. They sent their to @[nasjaq](https://twitter.com/nasjaq__)  and he called the function to win the game on September 29, 2021, splitting his profits among the complete strangers.\n\nThis couldn’t have been done without trust! What if @[nasjaq](https://twitter.com/nasjaq__)  just ran away with all the money? It would’ve taken more time to win the game, and people would’ve been discouraged from playing. By believing in and working with random strangers across the world, there was a group of winners, not just one. Intention and trust are key for being operative in a decentralized system. Furthermore, it attracts contributors, propelling the willingness to share ideas and information to further innovation.\n\n## 🤝 Manny x NFT Projects\n\nBy the time the initial game ended, a passionate community of gamers had spawned, and Manny was already looking to take his idea further. Taking suggestions from manny holders in the community, he built various integrations with other on-chain projects like [Loot (for Adventurers)](https://www.lootproject.com/), [RugStore](https://www.rugstore.exchange/), & [CrypToadz](https://cryptoadz.io/) to create a sense of exclusive collaboration.\n\n![praying on my rug ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lDX8AdWj9E6oGVyCsVkhY.png?height=1082&width=1058)\n\n[https://twitter.com/mannynotfound/status/1442290541081804802?s=20](https://twitter.com/mannynotfound/status/1442290541081804802?s=20)\n\n## 👾 The MannyVerse\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yoE8088tZQrUoI6Sdlauq.png?height=918&width=1456)\n\nInspired by the vibes, openness, and continuous launches of the integrations by Manny, [Spencer Obsitnik](https://twitter.com/spencerobsitnik) wanted to add his own twist. Unlike traditional game development where the team has less creative control, he loved the flexibility of Manny’s project and the freedom to do whatever you wanted with your manny. A game developer and 3D/VR fanatic by trade, he sought to expand the manny universe by importing his own manny into the video game engine [Unity](https://unity.com/) to build out the MannyVerse.\n\nFor players to spend more time in his world, he knew a networking piece would be crucial to the MVP game. Combining these elements and his own skills, Spencer created a beta with 4 main parts:\n\n* A manny home where you could kick it and change your accessories\n* A mini 3D spatial world where you could interact & chat with other mannys\n* A small room for non-manny owners to checkout the game\n* A fill-in puzzle with a mysterious reward\n\nWanting to motivate people to play and work together, Spencer scattered clues and prizes across the world as a further incentive for the curious and observant. Search for the clues in the MannyVerse and submit the key to get access to the prize: a royal [crowned manny](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/64799736011240759153880656082993841206279425514598060749704237041174158770177), and free/unlimited access to all of Spencer’s future projects!\n\n*(View full solution to the puzzle [here](https://twitter.com/spencerobsitnik/status/1449012461617795076?s=20))*.\n\n![a hint on the side of a painting ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/w9vs8mj-SMy50Q2niHy3t.jpeg?height=600&width=963)\n\nSimilar to when Manny launched his game, Spencer thought the community would be competitive, but instead were sharing clues with each other to help [@spicedreams](https://twitter.com/spicedreams_) take home the prize. A recurring theme among successful communities is trust, even that of complete strangers, and that starts with the founder/founding team (shoutout Manny).

{"id": "2I1j5YdLLlU4zPyzUsbHpnuvZeOUBr088VnKRiJmttA", "title": "The Year in Ethereum 2020", "body": "👋 Note: Originally published on Jan 20, 2021 on [Medium](https://jjmstark.medium.com/the-year-in-ethereum-2020-98123e5f160d).\n\n**Ethereum is the digital frontier.**\n\nBecause it is open and programmable, Ethereum offers a vast uncharted expanse filled with opportunity.\n\n**Over the last few years, this frontier has attracted its first major settlements.** The freewheeling bazaar of decentralized finance (“DeFi”) has grown into a sector that is beginning to compete with Silicon Valley. This year, a second ecosystem began to put down roots: the creator economy of cryptoart, music, and media.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum community is poised to adopt the most significant changes to the core protocol in its short history. The frontier is finally paving its busy roads.\n\n**Like in [2018](https://medium.com/@jjmstark/the-year-in-ethereum-87a17d6f8276)** and **[2019](https://medium.com/@jjmstark/the-year-in-ethereum-2019-242012e4276d)**, our goal is to zoom out and show you the bigger picture. This blog post is not comprehensive — writing a *comprehensive* roundup about Ethereum is nearly impossible. Instead, we focus on a handful of trends we believe were most significant.\n\nIn our view, these were the biggest developments of 2020:\n\n1. **Bigger than Bitcoin.** Ethereum eclipsed Bitcoin as the blockchain with the most valuable blockspace, and the blockchain used to transfer the most value.\n2. **Ethereum’s Creator Economy**. Artists, musicians, and creators of all types exit to Ethereum, where they control the value of their work.\n3. **DeFi: Revenge of the Dex …and more!** Decentralized exchanges changed the way the crypto industry traded, reaching a high of 16% of centralized trading volume.\n4. **Ethereum’s scaling upgrades are underway**. The first of the Eth2 upgrades — the beacon chain — went live on December 1, kicking off a multi-year process that will see Ethereum grow into the world’s settlement layer.\n\n**In 2020, Ethereum reached a critical mass**. From a high enough vantage point, it’s clear that the weight in the industry has shifted. This year will be remembered as the year that the entire crypto industry began orbiting Ethereum.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*GzJi1gdZ4mIgTMxvcIwmrg.png)\n\n## 1. Bigger than Bitcoin\n\nWhat is the world’s most popular blockchain?\n\nFor the first time in history, the answer is not “Bitcoin”.\n\n**The answer is: “well… according to which metrics?”**\n\nIn 2020, Ethereum passed Bitcoin on two of the most important metrics we have to compare blockchains. First, Ethereum was used to transfer the most value:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*qc48-zVgIqwB3aLUKlq76g.png?&size=medium)\n\nEthereum transferred \\~$1.6 trillion USD worth of assets, 60% more than Bitcoin’s \\~$1 trillion.\n\n**Ethereum’s most successful application — the [stablecoin](https://ethereum.org/en/stablecoins/)** — is the primary driver of Ethereum’s growing transaction volume. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that hold a fixed fiat value (usually dollars), and so are more useful as a store of value or medium of exchange than a volatile asset like BTC or ETH.\n\nEthereum’s volume grew throughout the year, and since July, has consistently been settling more value than Bitcoin.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*7D_ufrCQ7hp4oLO_88Xbjg.png?&size=medium)\n\n**Second, another key metric used to compare and measure** **the real use of cryptocurrencies are total transaction fees.** Every time someone uses Ethereum or Bitcoin (to send money, or use an application), they pay a small fee. Fees are a useful metric because they show real demand from paying users.\n\nIn 2019, total fees paid to use Bitcoin was 4x the fees paid to use Ethereum.\n\nIn 2020, that flipped. Fees paid to use Ethereum were nearly **double** Bitcoin’s.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*DHpdKepG6KOn1UOdfsDqwA.png?&size=medium)\n\n**Another way to frame this is in terms of the value of blockspace**. Every blockchain has a limited capacity. Over the whole year, there’s only so much “block space” that can be used for transactions. **In 2020, Ethereum’s blockspace was worth about twice as much as Bitcoin’s blockspace.**\n\nIf we look at cumulative fees across 2020, there is a clear shift in August when demand for Ethereum increased and fees began to rise.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*_5OmtL25qAlziZrF1UwN_Q.png?&size=medium)\n\n**Remarkably, even *applications built on Ethereum have — momentarily — had more paying use than the entire Bitcoin blockchain.*** On August 10, [fees paid to use Uniswap were tied with fees paid to use Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1292905687140519939), and since then [have occasionally exceeded 24h BTC fees](https://cryptofees.info/).\n\nOf course, Bitcoin still leads by other metrics.The marketcap of Bitcoin is still higher than the marketcap of all Ethereum-based assets. And, Bitcoin has greater name recognition with people outside of crypto.\n\nBut when you look at *real use* of these platforms, Ethereum has taken a clear lead over Bitcoin, and no other blockchain is within several orders of magnitude.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*GzJi1gdZ4mIgTMxvcIwmrg.png)\n\n## 2. Ethereum’s Creator Economy\n\n**[Beeple](https://twitter.com/beeple) is a digital artist.** [His real name is Mike Winkelmann](https://www.beeple-crap.com/about).\n\nHis work ranges from concert visuals (where he’s worked with One Direction, Eminem, Justin Bieber, and many others), to 3D / Motion Design work for clients like Apple, Nike, Activision, and others.\n\nFor 13 years, Beeple has created and published a piece of 3D art [every single day](https://www.beeple-crap.com/everydays) as a way to hone his skills and build a [large following on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/beeple_crap/?hl=en).\n\nHe first heard about Ethereum in 2017, but didn’t look very closely at it. Then this summer, he noticed some artists who work in his industry start to sell art on Ethereum.\n\nThese artists were selling unique digital artwork in the form of “non-fungible tokens” (NFTs). And they were making good money doing it. In July, Trevor Jones [sold a piece of digital art for $55,555](https://news.bitcoin.com/non-fungible-digital-artwork-sale-shatters-records-picassos-bull-nft-sells-for-55k/), at the time a record amount. Beeple decided to try it out for himself.\n\nUp until this point, Beeple’s “everyday” pieces didn’t pay well, or at all. **Instead, Beeple’s art made money for Instagram and Twitter, who sell ads to his millions of followers.** You could say that on these platforms, Beeple — and every other artist — just gets paid in exposure.\n\n![ILLESTRATER, by Beeple. Used with artists permission.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*e8RFJNFsOuF_FeafwfUi9Q.png)\n\n**Ethereum gave Beeple an exit from that system.** On Ethereum, 13 years of art stopped being an asset just for Instagram & Twitter, and became an asset for Mike. He was able to put his work on an open market, and find out what it was worth.\n\nIn December, Beeple sold a set of his everydays for a combined [3.5 million](https://cryptobriefing.com/digital-art-auction-raises-record-million/), setting a new record for cryptoart sales. During this sale, he [sold three editions of artwork for a total of $582,000 in five minutes.](https://decrypt.co/51270/beeple-nft-sale)\n\n**2020 was the year Ethereum’s creator economy reached a critical mass.** If ICOs were Ethereum’s first breakout application, and DeFi is the second, then the creator economy is quickly becoming the third.\n\nThe same tools that helped Beeple take ownership of his art are being used by other artists, musicians, fashion designers, writers, and more. But it was cryptoart where the growth was the most obvious. Over the last year, monthly volume of people buying and selling crypto art exploded:\n\n![https://cryptoart.io/data](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MhhdRfmQ2wrZgt3MXMRDc.png?height=455&width=1292&&size=medium)\n\nIn total, cryptoart volume was about $23 million in 2020. While this is small in comparison to the broader crypto markets, it’s not insignificant compared to other platforms for creators. To give a sense of scale, this early cryptoart volume on Ethereum is about 5% of the [$500 million Patreon paid out to creators in 2019](https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/patreon-3-million-patrons-500-million-dollar-payout-1203114979/).\n\n**What makes the creator economy notable isn’t the absolute volume, but the incredible *relative* value offered to artists.** For Beeple, cryptoart wasn’t just *marginally* better than the way he worked before. It was a zero-to-$3.5 million moment.\n\nThat’s why most of the artists who are exiting to Ethereum are not long-time crypto adherents. They’re established artists with pre-existing followings, who are drawn to what Ethereum offers: a better way to monetize their work, and an unexplored canvass for experimentation.\n\nTo name a few: **[Murat Pak](https://twitter.com/muratpak)**, who might best be known as the artist behind the [Archillect twitter account](https://twitter.com/archillect), has recently started creating & selling NFTs — and [explaining them in detail to their followers](https://twitter.com/muratpak/status/1337289802727776257) ([Pak](https://niftygateway.com/profile/pak)’[s Niftygateway](https://niftygateway.com/profile/pak)). Pak’s NFTs have brought in [more than $1 million USD in 2020](https://www.dapp.com/article/nft-crypto-art-millionaire?utm_source=rd). **[Mario Klingemann](https://twitter.com/quasimondo)**, who uses AI & machine learning to create bizarre and surprising generative art, has also gotten in to the NFT game (Mario’s [Superrare](https://superrare.co/quasimondo)). Or **[Joanie Lemercier](https://twitter.com/JoanieLemercier)**, whose work ranges from large light protection installations, to climate activism, to silkscreen prints (Joanie’s [Nifty gateway](https://niftygateway.com/collections/joanielemercier)).\n\n**The same toolkit that makes Ethereum a frontier for art [also offers a better model to musicians](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/crypto-will-fix-the-music-industry)**. In the last 6 months alone, [musicians sold more than $1M of NFTs and social tokens](https://twitter.com/water_and_music/status/1349759157071728644).\n\nOne of the most outspoken musicians to embrace Ethereum is [RAC](https://twitter.com/RAC), aka André Anjos. In October, André [released a fan token called $RAC](https://blog.ourzora.com/home/introducing-rac). The token was distributed to his existing fanbase to retroactively reward them. People received tokens if they had previously bought merch, or subscribed to RAC on various platforms. $RAC gives its holders access to exclusive perks, access to new work, and more. Other artists, like [3LAU](https://twitter.com/3LAU), [Tokimonsta](https://twitter.com/TOKiMONSTA/status/1344422116356067329), and [Portugal. The Man](https://www.stereogum.com/2113059/portugal-the-man-launch-crypocurrency-ptm-coin/news/) are experimenting with similar ideas.\n\nBehind the scenes, the creator economy’s growth is being enabled by a new generation of platforms, tools, and markets.\n\nOver the last few years, a large number of creator-economy marketplaces have sprung up. Some act as platforms for any type of NFT ([Rarible](https://rarible.com/), [Niftygateway](https://niftygateway.com/), [Opensea](https://opensea.io/)), whereas others specialize in a certain type (for cryptoart: [AsyncArt](https://async.art/), [KnownOrigin](https://knownorigin.io/), [MakersPlace](https://makersplace.com/), [Foundation](https://foundation.app/), and [Superrare](https://superrare.co/)) or a certain aesthetic, acting almost like a brand or label ([Zora](https://store.zora.co/)). Recently launched [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) aims to be a user-owned publishing platform, and Cent is trying to [tokenize and sell tweets](https://twitter.com/Cent). Audius, a crypto based music-streaming platform, grew to have [more than 1 million monthly users](https://twitter.com/roneilr/status/1322322362499387392) in October.\n\n**For most of its history, the crypto space has been synonymous with money.** But Ethereum’s frontier is much larger than finance. At the same time, the creative web is at a turning point, as artists, musicians, writers, and creators of every type are increasingly dissatisfied with the platforms that exclude them, censor them, control their relationships with their audience, and extract fees for that privilege.\n\nEthereum’s digital frontier is an exit from those systems.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*GzJi1gdZ4mIgTMxvcIwmrg.png)\n\n## 3. DeFi: Revenge of the Dex\n\n**In 2018, many had concluded Decentralized Exchanges (Dexes) were a failed experiment.**\n\nIn our [review of that year](https://medium.com/@jjmstark/the-year-in-ethereum-87a17d6f8276), we included a short note about [Uniswap](http://uniswap.org/), a new dex which had launched in November. In 2019, Uniswap grew substantially — daily volume went up by 6,000%.\n\nIn 2020, Uniswap was used to trade more than $58 billion worth of assets. In September, Uniswap was **[briefly doing more volume than Coinbase.](https://uniswap.org/blog/year-in-review/)** This growth isn’t limited to Uniswap — dex volume is increasing across the board:\n\n![https://duneanalytics.com/hagaetc/dex-metrics](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OpbR0KHRMAr6CaoDuOneL.png?height=1058&width=2000&&size=medium)\n\nIn October, combined dex volume [reached a high of 16% of all centralized exchange (CEX) volumes](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/dex-non-custodial/dex-to-cex-spot-trade-volume).\n\n**It was another year of incredible growth in DeFi, Ethereum’s financial system.** DeFi is a network of connected financial services & protocols being built on the internet, expanding access to basic financial services to everyone on earth. Today, you can use DeFi applications to save money, take out a loan, make payments around the world, earn interest on your assets, or speculate on crypto markets.\n\nIn February, DeFi [hit the milestone of $1 billion](https://www.coindesk.com/why-defis-billion-dollar-milestone-matters) in total value locked within DeFi protocols. By the end of December, that had grown to [$15 billion](https://defipulse.com/).\n\nAnd in November, the number of unique addresses that have ever used DeFi protocols surpassed 1 million.\n\n![https://duneanalytics.com/rchen8/defi-users-over-time](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IQzV0mo6CN7T7Gs0JaFyQ.png?height=808&width=2000&&size=medium)\n\nIt’s impossible to sum up everything that happened in DeFi this year, but four developments are worth calling out in particular:\n\n**1. In January, Aave introduced [flash loans](https://aave.com/flash-loans/).** Flash loans let anyone borrow an asset, do something with that asset, and then repay the original loan *all in the space of a single Ethereum transaction*. In effect, this makes it possible to offer **unsecured loans**. The lender’s risk is protected by the fact that the loan and the repayment happen, in effect, at the same time — if the borrower can’t repay the loan, then the loan was never made in the first place.\n\nThis is the *decentralization of arbitrage.* On Ethereum, if you find a market inefficiency and have some technical savvy, then you can profit from it. You don’t need to be an institution with many millions of dollars to take advantage of that arbitrage.\n\n**2. This summer, [Compound](http://compound.finance/) introduced liquidity mining — kicking off a protocol arms race.** Compound introduced a governance token, $COMP, which users could earn (“mine”) in exchange for adding liquidity to Compound, or borrowing from it. This tactic was quickly copied by other protocols, especially very *new* ones who had no depositors, and needed to quickly gain marketshare by offering high rates to “liquidity miners.”\n\nLost in the noise was this: protocols learning how to use the tools that Ethereum offers them to bootstrap themselves into existence, competing against established protocols in a brutal free market.\n\n**3. Uniswap kicked off a trend of rewarding past-users with tokens.** When Uniswap introduced a token ($UNI) and its own “liquidity mining” incentives, it also distributed 15% of all $UNI to early users of the protocol. This included users who previously provided liquidity, *and* anyone that had ever used Uniswap — even once.\n\nDistinct from liquidity mining, this is something new. Imagine if AirBnB or Uber had given 15% of their equity to early hosts, drivers, and users. Crypto protocols like Uniswap are experimenting with new models, that blur the lines between user and owner. What would the world be like, if our most valuable marketplaces were owned by the people who use them?\n\n**4. Bitcoin gets a new life as a wrapped token on Ethereum.** A Bitcoin is “wrapped” when it is locked somewhere (into a [protocol like TBTC](https://tbtc.network/), or by a custodian like [BitGo](https://wbtc.network/)), and then an IOU token is issued on Ethereum, which can be redeemed back on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nWhy are Bitcoin holders moving their Bitcoin onto Ethereum? Because on Ethereum, you can do things with your Bitcoin besides hold it. You can use your Bitcoin as collateral for a loan, or lend it out and earn interest on it. At the beginning of the year there were about 1,000 wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum, and [by November there were \\~154,000](https://defipulse.com/btc), nearly 1% of the total Bitcoin supply, being [put to work on Ethereum.](https://defipulse.com/btc)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*GzJi1gdZ4mIgTMxvcIwmrg.png)\n\n## 4. Ethereum’s Scaling Upgrades\n\nAfter years of research, planning, development, and testing, the Ethereum community laid the foundation for the [multi-year, multi-step Eth2 upgrades](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/).\n\nThis marks the beginning of a new phase. Over the next few years, the Ethereum community plans to make multiple inter-dependent upgrades to the core protocol, radically expanding the capacity and security of the network.\n\n**You’ve probably heard this project referred to as “[Eth2](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/)”, but this has always been a bad name**. “Eth1” and “Eth2” are not sequential versions of a thing, but rather two components of a whole — Ethereum — that will be merged together. The broader project is really a set of separate, but related, upgrades. The first of these upgrades — the Beacon chain — launched on December 1, 2020.\n\n## The beacon chain goes live\n\n**The [beacon chain](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/beacon-chain/) is the backbone of Ethereum’s new Proof of Stake consensus mechanism.** Today, the beacon chain isn’t being used by the Ethereum protocol — it’s just running smoothly, while the community fine-tunes and hardens it, in preparation for supporting a hundred-billion dollar network.\n\n**Ethereum’s Proof of Stake consensus system is unique.** No other blockchain community has prioritized decentralization — the ability for anyone, even with consumer hardware, to run a node — to the same degree as Ethereum.\n\nWhat happens next? There are two major tasks in the near future. One is to merge the Eth1 chain with Eth2, swapping out Proof of Work for the beacon chain’s Proof of Stake. The other, is to add data shards, which will open a new route to immediate scalability through rollups.\n\n## A rollup-centric roadmap\n\nIn October, Vitalik proposed [an adjustment to Ethereum’s roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698). This plan would prioritize expanding use of [rollups](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) to give the Ethereum ecosystem massive scalability gains in the near future.\n\n**Rollups are a layer 2 scaling technology.** The idea is that we can keep *data* on-chain, while moving execution “off-chain”, to an environment that can handle faster performance, while still preserving the characteristic safety guarantees of “on-chain” Ethereum transactions. For a detailed explanation, check out [Vitalik’s guide](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html).\n\n**The key to the rollup-centric roadmap is that rollups become even *more* powerful when combined with a specific Eth2 upgrade: data shards.** Data shards allow anyone to pay transaction fees to post data to several different sharded chains. Today (without data shards) rollups give Ethereum a 3000 transaction per second throughput capacity, but with data shards that throughput reaches more than 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nWe have rollups live on mainnet today (though they don’t yet use Eth2 data shards). [Loopring](https://loopring.io/), [Fuel](https://fuel.sh/) and [zkysnc](https://zksync.io/) already have ETH and token transfers enabled. All are capable of doing thousands of transactions per second with similar security assumptions as transacting on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\n2020 also saw optimistic rollups launch testnets with Solidity/EVM support. In 2021, we will see developers begin to port their applications to optimistic rollups (in fact, this blog post is late enough that we’ve [already begun to see it](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/mainnet-soft-launch-7cacc0143cd5)). As a result, transaction fees for end users will be lower, even as demand for Ethereum blockspace continues to grow.\n\nIf you want to read more about how Rollups fit into Ethereum’s roadmap, we recommend [this recent post by Ben Edgington](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/90818/ethereum-2-eth2-whats-next-2021).\n\n## The hobbyist staker community grows\n\n**As the beacon chain launch grew closer, a community of hobbyist stakers grew up around it.** This is a direct result of the Ethereum community’s decision to prioritize a PoS consensus mechanism that made it viable to participate with consumer hardware.\n\nCommunities like this *used* to exist in the early days of PoW mining, before ASICs centralized mining in the hands of large companies. Readers who were around in 2014–2016 will remember that being able to contribute to the network’s consensus on an *individual basis* was an important part of the crypto ethos, which has since been mostly lost. Now, Ethereum is bringing it back.\n\nIt’s another example of what makes the Ethereum community great. There was a need for education, resources, and tech support to help people learn how to set up their clients and stake successfully. The largest of these communities is [Ethstaker](http://ethstaker.cc/), a community of about 6,000 people on [Discord](http://invite.gg/ethstaker). If you’re interested in staking, this is the right place to start.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*GzJi1gdZ4mIgTMxvcIwmrg.png)\n\n## What did it all mean?\n\nEthereum is growing up.\n\n**Ethereum’s digital frontier is no longer an experiment, no longer a blank canvass.** It’s an economy, a growing city-state. Still rough around the edges, sure. But that’s always been part of the charm.\n\n**Since 2015, Ethereum has always been the underdog.** But 5 years later, it’s the protocol with the largest volume and the most valuable blockspace. There are still other metrics to conquer — but you can feel the Ethereum community’s goals expanding beyond simple comparisons to digital gold.\n\nBeing the most-used cryptocurrency isn’t worth much if crypto itself fails, if it doesn’t solve real problems, or if it can’t scale. Ethereum’s next challenges will be bigger, because they will be the whole crypto market’s challenges.\n\n**So, what are you waiting for?** Winter is over, and we’ve got work to do. The frontier doesn’t build itself.\n\n— *Josh Stark & Evan Van Ness*\n\n*Thank you to George Trotter, Jacob Horne, Mike Winkelmann, Superphiz, Richard Chen, and Danny Ryan.*", "timestamp": 1635206438, "digest": "ywsx9-AsGR83LOyRUdDx2NpfaLEQdS0lKxHpHYwvzTI", "contributor": "0x4aa9C5546BE68486c4eF264a230D25674a1A728e"}

{"id": "ue2pjC0v2Yx5DnmpQyrajlv0W91piWOn9zYezBfHJzw", "title": "The Year in Ethereum 2019", "body": "👋 Note: Originally published on Jan 22, 2020 on [Medium](https://jjmstark.medium.com/the-year-in-ethereum-2019-242012e4276d). \n\n**Ethereum began as a blank canvas.**\n\nEthereum is an open, permissionless blockchain that developers can use to create any kind of application they want.\n\nThis year, the early strokes laid down on that canvas began to form into a coherent picture.\n\nYou don’t have to *squint* so much to see the direction Ethereum is going. Protocols and applications [built on Ethereum](https://twitter.com/builtoneth) are beginning to find product-market fit, quickly building communities of thousands of paying users.\n\nThe empty spaces on the canvas are no longer sources of uncertainty or doubt. Instead, they look more like opportunities: what can we build over there?\n\n**2019 was the year Ethereum grew more confident**. The technical roadmap gained clarity as difficult engineering problems were solved, and the largest developer community in crypto is building applications that people actually pay to use.\n\nThis last year, it felt like every big challenge facing the crypto industry as a whole was being addressed primarily by the Ethereum community:\n\n* **It’s on Ethereum** where decentralized exchanges are solving the problem of trusted third parties, by letting users trade without ever giving up their private keys\n* **It’s on Ethereum** where smart wallets are solving intractable UX challenges, without requiring users give up control over their funds\n* **It’s on Ethereum** where stablecoins like Dai are solving the volatility problems that have made other cryptocurrencies poor payments technology. On Ethereum, peer to peer digital cash isn’t a dream, it’s real — [go use it](https://makerdao.com/en/)!\n\nLike [last year](https://medium.com/@jjmstark/the-year-in-ethereum-87a17d6f8276), our goal is to zoom out and show you the bigger picture. This is a summary of the most important developments and trends in Ethereum — the things that we’ll say mattered when we look back in ten years.\n\nIn our view, the biggest developments of 2019 were:\n\n1. **The Ethereum Economy continued to grow**. DeFi remains the largest sector within Ethereum, and we saw early signs of growth in gaming & decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).\n2. **Ethereum nudged into the mainstream**. Major corporations, financial institutions, consumer brands, and even celebrities began actually using Ethereum.\n3. **Ethereum 1.0 improved**. A number of projects led to major performance improvements, and a direction was chosen for long-term sustainability.\n4. **Eth2 made progress as an engineering project**, and laid the foundation for launching in early 2020.\n5. **Layer 2 made steady progress, with new tech capturing the community’s attention.** Rollups and Zero Knowledge technology made the largest strides this year, while other technologies like state channels made steady progress.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1350/1\\*Rd-oplSVeBpgitBPuyZlKQ.png)\n\n## 1. The Ethereum Economy Grows\n\nIn this year’s review, we want to put Ethereum’s adoption into context of the rest of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nOne obviously important metric to use is simply: are people actually paying to use cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications?\n\nAny time someone uses a blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum, they pay a small fee which is collected by miners. Here are the total fees paid in 2019:\n\n![Source: Coinmetrics](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0Jqz3o02FoTevC8vggIsT.png?height=1182&width=1912&&size=medium)\n\nThis graph shows the top 16 blockchains, ranked by fees paid (for obvious reasons, it does not include blockchains where there are no fees). You can see all of the underlying data [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qko_xntJI6wONiD7YyqvedU6_65Hfy4QuWcWx8gN6O8/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n**The reality is that there are only two blockchains with significant use: Bitcoin and Ethereum.** As we’ll see in later sections, many individual applications on Ethereum have more paying use than most blockchains with market caps in the billions of dollars.\n\n## 💰 The Year of Decentralized Finance (Again)\n\nIn 2019, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) remained the most significant ecosystem within the Ethereum economy.\n\n**The DeFi vision is simple: an alternative worldwide financial system.** The internet has made information cheap and universally accessible, and Satoshi made information into money. Every person on earth should be able to access a financial system — payments, savings, lending, investing — through the internet.\n\n**Although this system is early, it exists today**. If you live in a country with a weak financial system or hyperinflation, DeFi may already be a [better alternative than your domestic banks and financial institutions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHji4x5C1q0)\n\nDeFi gives us cryptocurrencies that hold a stable value (“stablecoins”), a necessary innovation for any realistic payment use-case. DeFi has enabled thousands of users to earn interest, by lending out their ETH to borrowers. DeFi has enabled the easy creation of assets that automatically execute trading strategies & grow your wealth.\n\n**All of this is available today**, through a financial system that never closes, is openly auditable and transparent, and where your account can’t be shut down if [you work in the wrong industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point) or have the [wrong political views](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/51107343).\n\n**This year, one of Ethereum’s under-appreciated virtues came into clearer focus: applications built on Ethereum are interoperable and composable**. [If you are creating or issuing a new asset onto Ethereum, you can easily “plug in” to a protocol that facilitates asset trades](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1191544017340772352). As David Hoffman puts it, [Ethereum is “money legos”](https://medium.com/pov-crypto/ethereum-the-digital-finance-stack-4ba988c6c14b) that make it easy to create more complex systems. This allows DeFi products to quickly become more useful to users, taking advantage of the extensive infrastructure that has already been built.\n\nWhile DeFi is still [relatively early and risky](https://twitter.com/technocrypto/status/1188516292858437632), the convenient thing about being a financial system is that it comes equipped with tools to help manage risks. The interest rates paid to users who lend their ETH in DeFi have been relatively high, in part because using these platforms introduces risk.\n\n[Insurance protocols like Nexus Mutual have sprung up](https://nexusmutual.io/) to give users a way to hedge the unavoidable risks of working at the frontier of a new industry. Nexus Mutual launched in July, and in the next 5 months users paid about $11,000 in premiums. That’s greater than the total transaction fees paid to use the privacy cryptocurrency Grin over the same period ($7,600).\n\n## **📈 How much did DeFi grow in 2019?**\n\n**The simplest metric used to track DeFi’s growth is the total value of assets “locked” (TVL) in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem**. In other words, how much money is currently stored in the smart-contracts that serve as infrastructure for this financial system?\n\nIn 2018, this value more than tripled from \\~$70 million to $300 million.\n\nIn 2019, it more than doubled to $667 million on December 31, 2019:\n\n![source: Concourse Open, DeFi Pulse](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6FWY365cpUbbb-X3Ohmjc.png?height=1007&width=2000&&size=medium)\n\nAnother way of viewing the growth of the DeFi ecosystem is to visualize not only the total value locked, but the number of accounts using them and how many interactions those accounts have with the application.\n\n**At the start of 2019, MakerDAO was the only DeFi protocol with significant funds, a total of 1.86 million ETH (at the time, valued at \\~$260.4 million).** In the graph below, the size of the circle corresponds to the amount of ETH locked in the protocol:\n\n![Source: Alethio (01–01–2019 data)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*i-OqRVug7-YqVoep.png)\n\nBut by the end of 2019, the field was much more diverse:\n\n![Source: Alethio (12–15–2019 data)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*a2jVUpUlQBTu-fOH.png)\n\n**[Compound](https://compound.finance/) grew its TVL by 1,000%, from 35,000 ETH to 350,000 ETH, and rapidly grew its number of users.** MakerDAO is captured in a moment of transition between the original “single collateral” version of DAI (green circle) to “Multi-collateral” DAI (yellow circle). Both types of DAI have a combined TVL of 2.15 million ETH, an increase of 16%.\n\n## **🌐 Decentralized Exchanges grow in variety and volume**\n\n**Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) are an alternative to centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.** DEXs let you trade your assets over the internet without requiring a centralized intermediary like Coinbase, Binance, or [Quadriga](https://cointelegraph.com/news/quadrigacx-users-lose-190m-as-speculations-over-cottens-death-swirl).\n\n**One of the most exciting developments in 2019 was the rise of [Uniswap](https://uniswap.io/)**.\n\n[Uniswap](https://uniswap.io/) is a new kind of decentralized exchange. In a “normal” DEX, traders interact with each other — they offer to sell at a price, find a buyer, and then trade directly.\n\n**With Uniswap, you trade directly with the Uniswap protocol.** The Uniswap protocol *itself* is the market maker, who sets prices and offers to trade. This is accomplished 100% on-chain, with no off-chain dependencies.\n\n**Because Uniswap is built on Ethereum, anyone can use it by calling its contracts**. This lets *other* DeFi protocols utilize Uniswap as a way to bootstrap liquidity for a market, quickly enabling anyone to trade a new asset. Uniswap is one particularly useful “money lego” that has been integrated into many other products and services.\n\n**Because Uniswap is built on Ethereum, it is uncensorable**. You might be able to take down one particular front-end for Uniswap, but the underlying contracts — the real product itself — remains accessible to anyone with an internet connection.\n\n[In 2019, Uniswap](https://twitter.com/uniswapexchange/status/1212092582223896578) went from an average daily volume of $25K to $1.5 million (an increase of +6,000%), and grew its available liquidity from $500K to $25 million (+5,000%).\n\n![Source: DeFi Pulse](https://miro.medium.com/max/1358/0\\*HQsaZfVXYgqAif89)\n\nOver the course of 2019, Uniswap liquidity providers (people who “lock” their assets into the protocol, in order to earn a return for the service of providing liquidity) earned more than $1.2 million in fees.\n\nAs a useful comparison, that is greater than the total combined transaction fees paid in 2019 to use Ethereum Classic ($587K), Litecoin ($413K), and Ripple ($179K).\n\nThose three blockchains have a combined marketcap of $13 billion. Uniswap is a team of 4 that raised a $1.8 million seed round in mid-2019.\n\n**Also in 2019:**\n\n* Beyond Uniswap, DEXs on Ethereum had an impressive year. Total trading on DEX’s built on Ethereum passed [$2.3 billion](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/51099/total-dex-volume-on-ethereum-surpasses-2-3b-in-2019-with-idex-leading-the-market).\n* [Kyber](https://kyber.network/), one of the largest decentralized exchanges, [grew its volume](https://blog.kyber.network/kyber-ecosystem-report-9-29d1c64b48a7?gi=bf91263f3181) 443% from $70 million to $380 million.\n* [0x](https://0x.org/) ended the year with $254 million in volume, and the number of trades increased 27% — [a year of focusing on liquidity and R&D](https://blog.0xproject.com/0x-2019-in-review-4fa646d00206).\n* We saw the rise of DEX aggregators like [Totle](https://www.totle.com/), [dex.ag](https://dex.ag/) and [1inch.exchange](https://1inch.exchange/#/). These are services which allow users to find the best price across DEXs.\n\n## **🏦 Lending Services**\n\n**One of the most significant developments in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem was the [rapid growth of lending services](https://defipulse.com/defi-lending)**.\n\nThese applications let users lock their cryptocurrency into smart contracts, where other users can borrow it, paying you interest. In 2019, more than [$600 million ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vc-DGG0iqEBQqNlsr5x6vxGxWUAEdgV3/view)in loans were originated on Ethereum. That is more than double the [total value of all payday loans made in Washington state in 2017](https://dfi.wa.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2017-payday-loan-report.pdf) ($248 million).\n\nFor instance, [right now you can take any DAI you have, and start earning 5.9% interest annually](https://medium.com/compound-finance/the-compound-guide-to-supplying-borrowing-crypto-assets-94821f2950a0) by lending it through the [Compound](https://compound.finance/) lending protocol. In 2019, Compound grew its TVL from $20 million to $91 million.\n\nOr, you [could lock some of your ETH into the MakerDAO protocol, as collateral to take out a loan of DAI ](https://medium.com/@eric.conner/maker-dai-cdp-how-to-get-a-cheap-decentralized-loan-in-minutes-8ba682870e17)(which you could then lend on Compound, if you wanted).\n\nIn 2019, [users paid $5.5 million in fees](https://graphs.santiment.net/makerdao#collateral) to the MakerDAO protocol, a total that is greater than the sum of all transaction fees paid on every blockchain other than Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n## **💵 Stablecoins**\n\n**Stablecoins fulfill the original vision of cryptocurrency as “peer to peer digital cash” — a useful means of making cheap, fast payments over the internet**. A digital dollar you can use to make payments, receive your salary, and that won’t lose its value overnight in the volatile cryptocurrency markets.\n\n**Virtually all stablecoins are built on Ethereum**. This year, Ethereum gained even greater dominance as the default platform for stablecoins, as [Tether ](https://tether.to/)— the oldest and largest stablecoin — [moved a majority of its outstanding supply](http://ether0x/) over to Ethereum, transitioning off the (Bitcoin based) Omni protocol.\n\n![Tether on Omni (Dark green) and Tether on Ethereum (Light green) — Source: Coinmetri](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0\\*UMEpzILi8XtwXSR7.png?&size=medium)\n\nIn 2019, Tether issued approximately $ 2.3 billion onto Ethereum, with more than $1 billion of that total directly coming at the expense of Bitcoin’s Omni. **This was the largest migration of assets from one blockchain to another in history.**\n\n[MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/), the protocol which supports the Dai stablecoin (covered extensively in [Year in Ethereum 2018](https://medium.com/@jjmstark/the-year-in-ethereum-87a17d6f8276)), went through a major upgrade. While originally DAI could only use ETH as the “single collateral” available to issue new DAI, in November MakerDAO [successfully launched “Multi collateral DAI”](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/47416/multi-collateral-dai-goes-live-on-makerdao) which makes it possible to use many assets on Ethereum in the system.\n\n## **💥 A Cambrian explosion of Ethereum-based assets**\n\n**One major new trend in DeFi is the expansion of products and protocols that facilitate the use of synthetic assets.** By “synthetic asset” we simply mean an asset that is designed to have specific characteristics, often imitating the profile of *other* assets.\n\n**The programmability and interoperability of assets on Ethereum makes this easy.** Using Ethereum smart-contracts, developers have created assets that track the value of other cryptocurrencies, automatically implement specific trading strategies, or create custom derivatives.\n\nSet protocol launched [TokenSets](https://www.tokensets.com/) in [April,](https://medium.com/set-protocol/tokensets-is-live-automate-your-crypto-portfolio-now-50f88dcc928d) a suite of products that allow anyone to purchase an ERC-20 that then implements a specific trading strategy. For instance, you might buy $1,000 worth of the “ETH 20 Day MA Crossover” set, which rebalances between ETH and the USDC stablecoin, depending on a specific market indicator. The goal is that when ETH is rising, this TokenSet is mostly ETH, and when ETH is falling, it swaps into a stablecoin to avoid losses.\n\n[Universal Market Access (UMA)](https://umaproject.org/) introduced a service that lets anyone create synthetic tokens that track the price of real-world assets like stocks, or really anything at all that you have a price feed for. At the [ETHBoston](http://eth.boston/) hackathon, hackers used UMA to create a synthetic asset that tracks whether DAI deviates from its dollar peg, resulting in a massive payoff if the peg breaks. At [ETHWaterloo](https://ethwaterloo.com/), the UMA team created [a synthetic asset that tracked the amount of human fesces sightings in San Francisco](https://www.notion.so/Poop-Exchange-Tokens-to-track-shit-sightings-in-SF-e1dbb976cb6e4d46b6382859bda9bfb4), which they promptly [integrated into a fork of Uniswap](https://uniswap-demo.umaproject.org/) so people could trade it on testnet.\n\n[Synthetix](https://www.synthetix.io/) launched their “synths” product, which are ERC-20s that track the value of major currencies, commodities, or indices. [Notably, Synthetix began trying to implement their protocol on EOS, decided it was a mistake, and have doubled down on building on Ethereum.](https://blog.synthetix.io/cross-chain-infrastructure-revisited/)\n\nIn 2019, users paid approximately $3.5 million in fees to use Synthetix, a total that is greater than the sum of all transaction fees paid on every blockchain other than Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n**Also in 2019:**\n\n* **Efforts to make Bitcoin useable on Ethereum gained momentum**. Kyber, Bitgo, and Republic launched [wBTC](https://www.wbtc.network/), an ERC-20 backed by real Bitcoin, stored with trusted custodians. In August, Keep & Summa announced their plans for [“trustless BTC” (tBTC)](https://tbtc.network/), which required no central counterparty to custody the BTC. Launched is planned for 2020.\n* **RealT tokenized the legal ownership of several houses in Detroit** — starting with [9932 Marlowe](https://goo.gl/maps/2np2r8VZjHbfyhjo9). Owners of these tokens have access to liquidity through Uniswap, where they can always find a counterparty to buy out their stake in the home.\n* [Compound](https://compound.finance/) — already mentioned above in the lending section — launched [cDai](https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-cdai/), a token that accrues interest. Products like cDai are collapsing the distinction between a “lending service you use” and “an asset you buy”.\n* Many synthetic assets depend on some kind of Oracle to report information. “Trustless” oracles are unsolved, and remain [one of the hard problems in the cryptocurrency space](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/11/22/progress.html).\n\n## 👾 Ethereum’s gaming sector grows\n\nIn 2019, Ethereum’s gaming ecosystem showed early signs of growth.\n\n**One of the standout examples is Gods Unchained: a turn-based, collectible card game similar to Blizzard’s Hearthstone**. The difference is that Gods Unchained cards are assets on Ethereum: they can be bought, sold, traded over DEXs, or even someday used as collateral.\n\nIn 2018, they sold $4 million worth of cards to the market, and this year they began “activating” those cards to be used in the game. [This led to the largest number of transfers of “non-fungible” tokens (ERC-721s) in history](https://coinmetrics.substack.com/p/coin-metrics-state-of-the-network-b34):\n\n![Source: Coinmetrics](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*63ATaahJIdBEofLb)\n\n[In November, GU enabled open trading of the cards](https://twitter.com/GodsUnchained/status/1197733725313699843?s=20). Within a few days, more than $220K worth of cards had been traded on [OpenSea](http://opensea.io/), a popular marketplace for NFTs.\n\nThe other notable gaming launch was [PoolTogether](https://www.pooltogether.com/).\n\n**[PoolTogether](https://www.pooltogether.com/)** is a *no-loss lottery system*, made possible by Ethereum. It’s simple: players deposit DAI into a program running on Ethereum. That pool of money earns interest over time, by automatically lending it out on [Compound](https://compound.finance/). Then, at the end of the period, one player wins the earned interest (as of this writing: $688 every week). It is “no loss” because if you don’t win, you haven’t lost the price of your “ticket” since you can just withdraw your funds.\n\nPoolTogether launched in June, and in the next six months its users won a total of $3,594. Over the same six month period, Tezos validators earned transaction fees totalling $3,745.\n\n**PoolTogether is especially notable as an indicator of a larger trend**: financial applications that look like games, and games that look like finance. There has always been a space where these two realms collide — WoW, EVE Online, casinos, the stock market — but Ethereum lets us collapse the distinction entirely. Expect to see more entrants to this [new category](https://medium.com/@TrustlessState/ethereum-the-money-game-landscape-1b9fdb05f842) in 2020.\n\n**Also in 2019**:\n\n* [Skyweaver,](https://www.skyweaver.net/) an Ethereum-based card game launched their Beta in June and raised $3.75 million from investors.\n* [Decentraland,](https://decentraland.org/) a virtual world where property exists as an asset on Ethereum, readies for its public launch in early 2020.\n* [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) — the first breakout game on Ethereum — maintained its dominance, as [Cryptokitties were still the most-transferred NFT on Ethereum.](https://mailchi.mp/8d7029b09e75/how-active-is-web3-gaming)\n\n## 👹 Decentralized Autonomous Organizations\n\n**Since the early days of Ethereum,** people have dreamed of creating Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs.\n\nThe idea is simple: Ethereum lets us write un-censorable code that executes on a distributed, decentralized platform. We could create a program that holds funds, and defines a governance process used to determine how to manage those funds. For instance, by defining a voting process.\n\nSince the painful [“The DAO” fork in 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)), the idea has been haunted by a mixed legacy. But in 2019, new projects revived interest in DAOs.\n\n**While 2019 did not become the “Year of the DAOs”, it did have at least a few “Months of Moloch”.** MolochDAO, which [launched in February 2019](https://twitter.com/MolochDAO/status/1100517160420397056), is aimed at funding important public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem. Using money donated from several sources (like the Ethereum Foundation, Vitalik, Joe Lubin, and ConsenSys), the members of the MolochDAO vote on which projects to fund.\n\nThis simple model ended up being the DAO project that most captured the Ethereum community’s attention, and was echoed by several other efforts like [MetaCartel](https://www.metacartel.org/) and [MarketingDAO](https://marketingdao.org/). [Ross Campbell began an effort to launch “LAOs”](https://medium.com/@thelaoofficial/the-lao-joins-forces-with-moloch-dao-and-metacartel-to-begin-to-standardize-dao-related-smart-b6ee4b0db071), or “Legal DAOs” that interoperate with traditional legal systems, influenced by the MolochDAO framework.\n\nIn another notable example of the value of Ethereum’s composable nature, [Saint Fame](http://saintfame.com/) — a “decentralized fashion house” DAO — launched their first product in December.\n\nSaint fame issues tokens on [Uniswap](https://uniswap.info/), which can later be redeemed for a specific product: a designer t-shirt. Trading the tokens openly on Uniswap lets the price of the t-shirt rise and fall in response to demand. Members of the DAO will vote on how funds are used to create new designs, which can then be sold through the same mechanism.\n\nSaint Fame is built using [Aragon](https://aragon.org/) — a comprehensive framework and toolkit for DAOs. [Aragon](https://aragon.org/) itself saw early signs of adoption, and by the end of 2019 more than 900 DAOs had been created by the framework.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1350/1\\*WzCPv-eHD3WTGruQeaeuNw.png)\n\n## 2. Ethereum nudges into the mainstream\n\n**In September, NBA player [Spencer Dinwiddie](https://twitter.com/SDinwiddie_25)** **[announced plans](https://twitter.com/SDinwiddie_25/status/1177237302113964033)** to “tokenize” his contract. He would sell 90 Ethereum-based tokens, which would give the holder a portion of Spencer’s future contract value, plus interest. In exchange, he would receive $13.5 million out of his $34 million contract up-front.\n\nThe NBA initially opposed the move, claiming it breached Spencer’s contract with the league. But over the next few months, the plan was back on, set to launch in January 2020.\n\n**The most astonishing thing about this story is that in 2019, it didn’t seem out of the ordinary.** If you had speculated in 2015 that within a few years an NBA player would be *actually using Ethereum* as a platform for financial innovation, no one would have taken you seriously.\n\nBut this year it happened — along with a lot of other small moves towards the mainstream:\n\n* The [Sacramento Kings launched a rewards-token built on Ethereum](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nba-sacramento-kings-reward-loyal-150001092.html?soc_src=social-sh&soc_trk=tw).\n* Star Trek [announced a series of collectible iconic ships](https://ca.startrek.com/news/blockchain-technology-star-trek), which will be issued as NFTs on Ethereum.\n* Opera, the 6th largest browser in the world, added native support for Ethereum at the end of 2018, and in [2019 launched a desktop browser complete with a “Dapp store](https://www.coindesk.com/opera-launches-dapp-focused-desktop-browser-with-built-in-ethereum-wallet)”.\n* Samsung [released a developer platform built for Ethereum](https://twitter.com/Samsung/status/1189149884026216449/), and [announced a new phone with a built-in Ethereum wallet](https://twitter.com/coindesk/status/1169494551175880704).\n* Ethereum’s [DeFi ecosystem was covered in Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-10-05/crypto-rebels-trip-over-each-other-en-route-to-financial-utopia?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=twitter&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_content=business)\n* [Gridplus](http://gridplus.io/) — an energy company built on Ethereum — [went live](https://blog.gridplus.io/gridplus-is-live-in-texas-efc83c814601) in February, and now serves electricity customers in Texas\n\n**Meanwhile in the enterprise world, the lines started to blur between “Enterprise Blockchain” and “Mainnet Ethereum”.**\n\nMainstream enterprise corporations have realized that spinning up a private or consortium chain isn’t that different from a siloed, centralized database. But they’ve started to pursue an interest in mainnet Ethereum, which offers an open platform backed with billions of dollars of economic security.\n\nOne of the strongest proponents of mainnet for enterprise has been [EY](https://www.ey.com/), who continued their work on “[Nightfall](https://github.com/EYBlockchain/nightfall)”. Nightfall is a project that aims to enable enterprise to use Ethereum mainnet, while ensuring that the transactions are private and scalable — addressing two of the major concerns that limit enterprise use of Ethereum today. In December, [EY launched v3 of Nightfall](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/news/2019/12/ey-releases-third-generation-zero-knowledge-proof-blockchain-technology-to-the-public-domain), bringing the transaction cost down to pennies instead of dollars.\n\n**Meanwhile, Microsoft continued its deep involvement with the Ethereum ecosystem.** In May, Microsoft released the [Azure Blockchain Development Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=azblockchain.azure-blockchain), specifically to support Ethereum development. Visual Studio, Microsoft’s popular IDE, now supports Ethereum through an extension, [fully integrated with Truffle](https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/truffle-msft-_-msft-approved-_-june-2019-1/). In June, [they announced VeriSol](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/researchers-work-to-secure-azure-blockchain-smart-contracts-with-formal-verification/?ocid=msr_blog_verisol_tw), a formal verification tool for Ethereum.\n\nIn October, Microsoft joined with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance to work on a [tokenized incentive system](https://www.coindesk.com/microsoft-and-intel-back-ethereum-based-token-system-to-reward-consortium-efforts) for use within enterprise consortiums. And in November, Microsoft launched [Azure Blockchain Tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/blockchain/tokens/overview), a service that lets enterprises issue their own tokens onto Ethereum.\n\nMany of these developments — in both consumer and enterprise contexts — might seem small. But together they paint a clear picture: even as general interest in cryptocurrency has slowed and flattened, Ethereum continues to reach outside the cryptocurrency industry, and is seeing early signs of adoption beyond the core community.\n\n**Also in 2019:**\n\n* [HyperLedger Besu becomes first public-chain client in Hyperledger.](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2019/08/29/announcing-hyperledger-besu)\n* Cloudflare launched an [Ethereum Gateway](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-ethereum-gateway/).\n* JP Morgan announced plans for their [JPM Coin bank-backed cryptocurrency](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/news/digital-coin-payments). In May, they added to Quorum [an implementation of the Zether](https://www.coindesk.com/jpmorgan-adds-new-privacy-features-to-its-ethereum-based-quorum-blockchain) confidential payments protocol.\n* Banco Santander settled a $20mm bond on mainnet Ethereum (you can see the transactions [here](https://twitter.com/_JohnWhelan/status/1172265153230004224)).\n* [Many, many other examples ](https://twitter.com/AdamScochran/status/1217524744909660162)— too many to list here.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1350/1\\*WzCPv-eHD3WTGruQeaeuNw.png)\n\n## 3. Ethereum 1.0 performance & sustainability\n\nEvery application we covered above — from the hundreds of millions of dollars in DeFi protocols, to trading cards, to enterprise applications — runs on today’s Ethereum protocol and today’s Ethereum clients.\n\n**This year, “Ethereum 1.0” and the clients that support it received some of the most significant upgrades since Ethereum’s [homestead](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/29/homestead-release/)** release in 2016. These changes began to address state growth, client sync times, client disk IO, transaction throughput, and issuance. In 2019, more [EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/) were deployed than in any other year.\n\n## **🏆 Geth**\n\nGeth, Ethereum’s dominant client, received major upgrades this year. In July the [Geth team released v1.9.0](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/07/10/geth-v1-9-0/), which included major performance improvements and many new features. This year, the Geth team reduced the [time to fast-sync a full node by half to \\~ 4 hours](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/07/10/geth-v1-9-0/), and implemented a [10x reduction in disk IO](https://twitter.com/peter_szilagyi/status/1176056958568357889).\n\n**The Geth team deserves extraordinary credit for continuously improving the majority client software powering Ethereum.** While this work may not always receive the attention of a new breakout application or area of theoretical research, it is the work that makes Ethereum possible.\n\nHave you thanked your Geth maintainers today?\n\n## **⚙️ ETH 1.X**\n\nAt Devcon4 in November 2018, a group of core developers began to talk informally about how to make Ethereum 1.0 more performant in state size, sync times, and disk IO. While the long-term goal is a migration to Eth2, Ethereum must remain sustainable until that time.\n\n**In the months after Devcon, this initiative became known as “ETH 1.X”.** While many took this as an opportunity to push for a wide variety of ideas on how to change the EVM, fundamentally the core goal has always been sustainability through ideas like state rent, stateless clients, or repricing gas costs.\n\nThe results have been major improvements to Ethereum 1.0 across the board.\n\n**Ethereum’s maximum throughput increased** from \\~25 transactions per second, to \\~38. This was achieved by increasing the block limit to 10mm gas, while block times were reduced to 13 seconds after the Istanbul hard-fork. [EIP-2028](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/77aa54f578b13e15c45d22dc1d5f9d93e231366c/EIPS/eip-2028.md) contributed to this improvement as well, by reducing the gas cost of a single byte in a tx input from 68 gas to 16 gas.\n\nClient [optimizations to Parity suggested by Alexey Akhunov](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/releases/tag/v2.3.0) made it possible to increase the block limit *without* a corresponding increase in the [uncle rate](https://ethgasstation.info/blog/ethereum-uncle-rate/). As a result, uncle rates plummeted in 2019.\n\n![Source: Etherscan](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ctJLvn2l2HBucwVFi1eP2.png?height=593&width=1250&&size=medium)\n\n**Ethereum’s issuance of new ETH fell in 2019**. The [Constantinople hard-fork reduced issuance](https://www.coindesk.com/constantinople-incoming-tomorrows-two-ethereum-hard-forks-explained) per block from 3 ETH to 2 ETH. Further, the decline in uncle rates above *also* reduced issuance, since uncle blocks win partial rewards.\n\n**As a result, Bitcoin and Ethereum now have similar issuance rates**, with ETH’s planned issuance rate to drop again when the network is entirely proof of stake:\n\n![Source: Eric Conner](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c1ftokcdEPWN1vihDzzbt.png?height=1040&width=1858&&size=medium)\n\n**To address long-term sustainability, 2019 saw major advances in research towards a “[stateless](https://medium.com/@akhounov/on-the-state-rent-and-pivot-to-stateless-ethereum-ab4d967ff630)” model for Eth1.** Other approaches that were considered at the beginning of the year, like state rent, have been de-prioritized.\n\nThe goal of the **[stateless model](https://medium.com/@akhounov/on-the-state-rent-and-pivot-to-stateless-ethereum-ab4d967ff630)** is to reduce the amount of state-data that must be stored by each node. Using simple techniques like Merkel trees, we can provide a “block witness” to prove that a specific piece of data is in a specific block, without requiring the client to hold that block’s state data. Many nodes will still hold full state, but using these techniques we can allow *some* nodes to store less data.\n\nOne related project is [Beam Sync](https://medium.com/@jason.carver/intro-to-beam-sync-a0fd168be14a), which uses block witnesses to cut sync time to a matter of minutes, while completing a “full” sync in the background. [Beyond that, other types of “semi-stateless” clients](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/e8ujfy/are_stateless_clients_a_dead_end/faf9a6x/) will be introduced as work progresses.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1350/1\\*WzCPv-eHD3WTGruQeaeuNw.png)\n\n## 4. Eth2 is (almost) here.\n\n**Ethereum’s vision has always been a scalable, proof-of-stake blockchain.** It has been clear since the early days of cryptocurrency that despite being a technological leap forward, proof of work is deeply flawed.\n\nEven [optimistic estimates ](https://coincenter.org/files/estimating-bitcoin-electricity-use.pdf)of [Bitcoin’s energy use](https://www.ofnumbers.com/2019/10/15/have-pow-blockchains-become-less-resource-intensive/) put it as roughly comparable to the total energy used by countries like [Portugal or New Zealand.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption) Migrating to [proof of stake](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/proof-of-stake/) will eliminate this wasteful energy use, and allow Ethereum to grow over decades without radically increasing the world’s energy consumption.\n\nWhile the broad outlines of Ethereum’s migration to proof of stake were clear even in 2015, filling in the details has taken careful, difficult work.\n\n**Ethereum’s migration to proof of stake — known as Eth2 — has taken longer than many expected.** After multiple years of R&D, 2018 saw the project transition from a research topic to an engineering challenge. In 2019, multiple independent teams worked together to build the software necessary to launch the first phase of Eth2. There is now little doubt that Eth2 will enter production in 2020.\n\n**Like any good open-source project, Eth2 is being built in the open.** This process can seem messy to those who aren’t familiar with the “[bazaar](http://www.catb.org/\\~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/)” model of open-source software development, or who are more familiar with cryptocurrencies controlled by a single client team.\n\n**Eth2 is a large project that will be rolled out in phases over multiple years.** The first phase — Phase 0 — is expected to launch in Q2 2020. This involves launching the Beacon Chain, which serves as the “backbone” of Eth2. Phase 1 then introduces the Shard chains, which are secured by the underlying Beacon chain. In Phase 2, the system comes together into a functional whole. Shard chains become useable for transactions and smart contracts, and all of the core features familiar to users of Ethereum today.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, 9 independent teams were inspired to begin work on implementing Phase 0’s beacon chain. By the end of the year, Eth2 is beginning to see mature testnets.\n\nThese began in the summer as short-lived private testnets from a single team, and by September multiple clients were able to interact on a shared testnet. Key to this progress was Joe Delong’s push for a [weeklong networking lock-in](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/09/19/eth2-interop-in-review/) in Skeleton Lake, Ontario, where Eth2 implementer teams achieved interoperability between their clients and established networking standards. By December, this progress had enabled [longer-lived public testnets between multiple teams](https://twitter.com/sorpaas/status/1202651945430929409). You can even view these testnets on [public block explorers like Etherscan](https://beacon.etherscan.io/).\n\n**As Eth2 came into clearer view, the broader developer community was able to offer feedback — and criticism — that led to adjustments.** Specifically, shortly after Devcon, Vitalik published several notes proposing changes to Phase 1 that would [reduce the complexity of interaction between shards.](https://notes.ethereum.org/KbEyHiaSRQW_KS7dDK0OFw)\n\nDiscussion remains active on the best approaches to implement Phase 1 and Phase 2, as well as how best to migrate the existing Ethereum blockchain into Eth 2. Currently there are proposals being debated that would have Eth1 be the first shard of Eth2, which would take place *between* Phases 1 & 2. There is also active debate around [finalizing the current Eth1 proof-of-work chain](https://medium.com/@ralexstokes/the-finality-gadget-2bf608529e50) with Eth2´s beacon chain, which would enable a much earlier reduction of ETH issuance.\n\nMeanwhile, Phase 1’s data availability will allow Layer 2 solutions like rollups and state channels to blossom. For example, the potential throughput of rollups (which can already facilitate 2,000–3,000 tps on Eth1) [will increase by about 100x](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/b1x698/ethereum_dapps_will_scale_up_to_270000_txs_in/).\n\nEth2 is coming — get ready to stake in 2020.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1350/1\\*WzCPv-eHD3WTGruQeaeuNw.png)\n\n## 5. Layer 2 and off-chain tech\n\nThe idea behind all [Layer 2 technology](https://slideslive.com/38911607/making-sense-of-layer-2?locale=de) is that we can perform expensive computation “off chain”, while still retaining Ethereum’s characteristic security guarantees. This “second layer” can process transactions or computation much faster than Ethereum mainchain, leading to a more scalable network overall.\n\n**In late 2018, Barry Whitehat, [proposed ZK rollup](https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/roll_up)**. The basic idea is that we perform many transactions \\*off-chain, \\*and “bundle” them together. This “rolled up” group of transactions are then verified using succinct Zero-Knowledge Proofs (SNARKs), which confirms that each transaction is correctly signed by owners, preventing any invalid or manipulated transactions.\n\n**In early 2019, multiple streams of work adapted this idea in a new direction.** In June, John Adler & Mikerah published their work on “[Minimal Viable Merged Consensus](https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-viable-merged-consensus/5617)”, and in parallel [Plasma Group](https://plasma.group/) published their work on the “[Optimistic Virtual Machine](https://medium.com/plasma-group/introducing-the-ovm-db253287af50)” in July.\n\nEventually, the research community settled on “Optimistic rollups” to describe this category of technique, which bore similarities to an idea Vitalik initially called “shadowchains” in a [2014 blog post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/09/17/scalability-part-1-building-top/). Vitalik helpfully summed up this area of research in an [August blogpost](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/08/28/hybrid_layer_2.html).\n\n**Optimistic rollups use a similar technique of “bundling” transactions as ZK rollups, but use a different mechanism to “prove” them**. Instead of using SNARKs, Optimistic Rollups use a [cryptoeconomic](https://medium.com/l4-media/making-sense-of-cryptoeconomics-c6455776669) mechanism that lets the system “Optimistically” assume there are no invalid transactions, while still catching, preventing, and punishing (slashing a deposit) those who try.\n\nIn October, Plasma Group shipped a demo that used an Optimistic Rollup to deliver a [lightning-fast version of Uniswap at Devcon called Unipig](https://decrypt.co/10030/plasma-group-and-uniswap-release-new-ethereum-scaling-solution-at-devcon?amp=1).\n\n**[ZK Rollup and Optimistic Rollup have different advantages and disadvantages.](https://medium.com/matter-labs/optimistic-vs-zk-rollup-deep-dive-ea141e71e075)** Optimistic rollups are easier to implement in the near-term, and flexible enough to be used with different applications. ZK Rollup, however, has more potential in the long term, but is more specialized due to its use of zero knowledge proofs, and will require more R&D before it is useful for a wide variety of applications.\n\nMeanwhile, State Channels entered into a far less sexy, but no less important, phase of their development. With no outstanding research problems, several teams worked towards implementing a viable framework that applications could use to support channelized apps.\n\n**In July, the primary state channels teams met at ETHNewYork to discuss unifying standards and ensuring interoperability**. This led to the announcement of a single, unified specification, simply called [State Channels](http://statechannels.org/). Counterfactual and Magmo merged their engineering teams, replacing their own brands with the new joint project, and continued to make engineering progress.\n\n**State channels projects launched onto mainnet this year.** In March, [Connext](https://connext.network/) — a micropayments platform — launched the Dai Card, a simple browser-based payment system running built on channels. In September, Connext launched v2.0 of their platform onto mainnet, built on top of the [now-unified State Channels codebase](https://github.com/statechannels).\n\nIn July, [Celer launched their mainnet alpha](https://twitter.com/CelerNetwork/status/1148215555620401153). By October, CelerX mobile app was supporting [60k monthly active users](https://medium.com/celer-network/celer-network-2019-reflection-on-mass-adoption-developer-ecosystem-technology-innovation-and-41dd49d8df8).\n\nAdex, with a custom implementation of their own payment channels framework, quietly built a significant payment channels network, [settling more than 9 million transactions in a 2 month period over the summer](https://hackernoon.com/how-we-built-the-largest-payment-channel-network-on-ethereum-ky11r2h7c).\n\nStarkdex — a project between Starkware and 0x — [launched a PoC in June](https://blog.0xproject.com/starkdex-bringing-starks-to-ethereum-6a03fffc0eb7). In October, they released [OpenZKP](https://blog.0xproject.com/introducing-openzkp-1dea6b22dceb?gi=8803014ad6c3), an open source rust implementation of ZKPs. In October, Starkware [announced their plans](https://twitter.com/StarkWareLtd/status/1182115802104905728) to launch the first STARK powered Dex in collaboration with Deversifi, in early 2020.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1350/1\\*WzCPv-eHD3WTGruQeaeuNw.png)\n\n## What did it all mean?\n\n**This post isn’t comprehensive**. How could it be? There’s too much happening on Ethereum to keep track of, even [when you write a weekly newsletter about it](https://weekinethereumnews.com/).\n\nA few other items that deserve note:\n\n* **Smart wallets launched and gained traction**. Smart wallets use smart contracts to implement access and control logic, making the wallet more useful. For instance, this enables multi-factor authentication, “batching” of transactions for ease of use, and better recovery methods in case of lost keys. Three notable entrants in this category are [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/), [Dharma](https://www.dharma.io/), and [Gnosis Safe](https://safe.gnosis.io/).\n* **Big ethereum wallets continued to get bigger.** [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) exceeded [1 million installs](https://twitter.com/muellerberndt/status/1097169789385007104) on the Chrome store, and launched a [mobile version](https://medium.com/metamask/metamask-mobile-public-beta-a-feature-guide-and-walkthrough-9d01de7190ae). [Brave](https://brave.com/), an Ethereum-based browser and wallet, [surpassed 10 million monthly active users](https://brave.com/brave-passes-10m-mau/), and reached [more than 350,000 “publishers”](https://decrypt.co/14795/watch-out-google-brave-surpasses-350000-publisher-milestone) for its micropayment platform as of December.\n* **Prediction markets made steady progress**. [Augur](https://www.augur.net/) doubled its open interest from $1.3 million to $2.7 million, Gnosis’ Sight prediction market [launched into Alpha](https://twitter.com/koeppelmann/status/1172162269893025794), and [Numerai](https://numer.ai/)’s [Erasure protocol went live on mainnet](https://medium.com/numerai/the-erasure-protocol-awakens-48a34cc4b5d0).\n* **Ethereum Name Service (ENS)** launched the [new permanent registrar](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/ens-nft-emoji-75259145314f), made [ENS names NFT compatible](https://www.coindesk.com/the-ethereum-name-service-is-turning-nearly-300000-eth-domains-into-nfts), and saw users pay $350K in fees across its two [registrar](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf0ad5cad05e10572efceb849f6ff0c68f9700455) [contracts](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb22c1c159d12461ea124b0deb4b5b93020e6ad16). That’s roughly equivalent to the total fees paid to use Dash, Monero, NEO, Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin SV combined in 2019.\n* **The Ethereum community expanded its ability to fund public goods.** MolochDAO launched, [Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/?keyword=) captured the community’s attention, and the [Ethereum Foundation’s grant program was reborn as Ecosystem Support](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/11/19/Ecosystem-Support-Program-call-for-applications/).\n* **Ethereum.org got a reboot**, and the Ethereum community has [translated it into 20 languages](https://ethereum.org/languages/), while the site has [more than 100 contributors](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website#contributors)\n* Oh, and **[ETH is money](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22eth%20is%20money%22&src=typed_query)**.\n\n**If you only pay attention to generic crypto news, you might think 2019 was a disappointing year.** The market drifted sideways, new basechain protocol launches uniformly disappointed, and the hyped-up blockchain headlines disappeared from the news. It might seem like crypto is dying.\n\n**But if you’ve read this far, it should be easy to see why the Ethereum community hasn’t shared this sentiment.**\n\nIn 2019, it’s clear that there’s enough real activity at the application layer to give us some confidence that Ethereum is growing in the right directions.

{"id": "pVd-bcU8AOIBZlOYdxFQe9SvZqAcpADWq74lYpvUvYA", "title": "STARS Token Distribution", "body": "Stargaze is one of the first NFT markets to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Cosmos is a network of custom interoperable blockchains. It is currently the second largest ecosystem by volume, and includes Terra, Cosmos Hub, Thorchain, and Osmosis.\n\nStargaze aims to be a decentralized NFT market, totally owned and governed by its users. Therefore, distribution of STARS has to be equitable, accessible, and cover a large surface area.\n\n## Token Release Schedule\n\nA fair initial distribution is pivotal in setting the future direction of a network. Paired with a thoughtful inflationary release schedule, a network can optimize its token distribution.\n\nThe distribution of STARS is designed to front-load inflation in order to bootstrap the network. This is a similar issuance schedule to Bitcoin. However, instead of halvings, issuance will be cut by 1/3 each year (by multiplying the current issuance by a reduction factor of 2/3). Osmosis was the first protocol to use a [“thirding” token release schedule](https://medium.com/osmosis/osmo-token-distribution-ae27ea2bb4db) and heavily inspired Stargaze’s design.\n\nFor some background on using token incentives to bootstrap new networks, check out this great [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619?s=20) by Chris Dixon.\n\n![\"Thirding\" release schedule](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TwRgLvwwmYuxQ8c4BqR3f.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nStargaze will start with an initial supply of 1 billion STARS. An additional 1 billion STARS will be issued the first year. With this \"thirding\" schedule, the issuance for the following year will be 667M STARS. This leads to an **asymptotic max supply of 4 billion STARS**.\n\n![Total supply formula](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4zhWsUYN9KbC12rOFyAZM.png?height=126&width=1284)\n\n![Issuance calculations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ooIF-U44MYirt21oEg4LL.png?height=1542&width=1630)\n\nStargaze starts off decentralized on day one with a genesis supply that distributes the majority of the tokens to community members. The Foundation will hold a strategic reserve of tokens, and will drive adoption of the protocol by delegating to validators, onboarding creators, and providing grants for ecosystem development.\n\n![Community-focused genesis supply](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZTtjhTqZNqm1rNESQq8j2.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter 5 years, the initial distribution is only 27.6% of the entire token supply. This issuance schedule allows Stargaze to grow and adapt its ownership to new creators, curators, validators, delegators, and other stakeholders.\n\n![Genesis supply vs. new issuance after 5 years](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k_VH9Rk86klZ7IXo2ZbKC.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nTokens for seed investors, validators, founders, and advisors are locked up for 1 year, and linearly vest after that for another 6 months - 1 year. This helps align values with the the development team and early stakeholders.\n\n## Airdrop\n\nThe goal of the Stargaze airdrop is to reach the most active participants in the Cosmos ecosystem. Stakers and liquidity providers are more likely to be more active than just token holders. Therefore, Stargaze is doing its airdrop to a mix of network participants:\n\n* **ATOM stakers**\n* **OSMO stakers or liquidity providers**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Cosmos Hub**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Osmosis**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Regen Network**\n\nFor each role above, you will be able to claim **2,453 STARS**. Distributing a fixed amount is in the spirit of the original Uniswap airdrop, giving every user more or less an equal starting point. In order to claim your airdrop, you have to perform 4-5 actions on Stargaze when it launches. If you have used [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) or [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), you’re already familiar with performing tasks to claim tokens. Some claimable actions include bidding on NFTs, staking, and voting in governance.\n\nSome minimums were put in place to prevent dust accounts and those attempting to game airdrops:\n\n* **ATOM staker: 5 ATOM minimum staked**\n* **OSMO staker: 50 OSMO minimum staked**\n\nFurthermore, delegations to centralized exchange validators were excluded.\n\nFor example, if you’re an ATOM staker and OSMO LP, and meet the above minimums, then your airdrop reward is 4,906 STARS.\n\nOsmosis liquidity providers get the airdrop regardless if LP tokens are bonded or not.\n\nAirdrop claimable amounts start decaying 4 months after the launch of the NFT market. The decaying process linearly decreases the claimable amount for another 4 months.\n\n![Airdrop must be claimed to prevent decay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3_QgqhG1LETOtyBdL0a7P.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter the airdrop claim period, unclaimed STARS are sent to the Community Pool.\n\nSnapshots were taken on Oct 11th, 2021 from Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and Regen Network.\n\nTo see how much STARS you’re eligible to claim, please visit <https://stargaze.zone/airdrop>.\n\n***Note: Airdrops won’t be claimable until after Phase 3 of launch. Please see Phase 3 below.***\n\nhttp://stargaze.zone/airdrop\n\n## Reward Distribution\n\nNew token reward distribution will be optimized to facilitate the operations of the NFT market.\n\nThe initial breakdown per block will be:\n\n![Per block distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UzjJ1v4qZ-bF5zw1BY9kr.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAll chain parameters can be changed via governance vote. Everything suggested in this post are sensible defaults. We expect governance to adapt and change the protocol as it matures.\n\n### NFT Incentives\n\n45% of block rewards are set aside for NFT bidding and staking incentives. Token holders will be able to earn yield by bidding and staking on NFTs for certain periods of time. An upcoming post will outline this mechanic in detail.\n\nIf governance determines that NFT incentives are too high for achieving the desired effect of the protocol, they may direct these incentives towards the Community Pool where they can be spent later.\n\n### Staking Rewards\n\nAs per the course with proof-of-stake networks, validators (node operators) earn rewards for securing the network. They also accept delegations from token holders, and charge a commission of 5% or greater for providing the service.\n\nNearly 100 validators were selected to join mainnet after 3 testnets, 2 of which were incentivized. They will earn 35% of all block rewards.\n\n### Developer Rewards\n\nInitially, 15% of block rewards will go to fund the team that contributes to the development of Stargaze. Each account gets a specific weight set by governance. When a developer is no longer contributing, governance can choose to modify their weight or remove their allocation.\n\n### Community Pool\n\nThe Community Pool is the main DAO that operates the network. It is responsible for voting on parameter changes, software upgrades, community matters, and more. It will receive 5% of all block rewards.\n\n## Phased Launch\n\nSince Stargaze is a layer 1 blockchain with many moving parts, it will launch in phases.\n\n* **Phase 0: Chain launch with 0% inflation (Oct 29th)**\n* **Phase 1: Liquidity pools on [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and [Gravity DEX](https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/)**\n* **Phase 2: Governance proposal to enable inflation**\n* **Phase 3: Web app launch with first NFT drop**\n\nMore details about the liquidity pools will be forthcoming. Please follow us on social media (links below) for updates. They are planned for 2-3 weeks after Phase 0, and have to go through governance to be funded via the Community Pool.\n\nNew tokens won’t be issued until after Phase 2, when inflation kicks in. At this time you’ll be able to stake STARS at [stargaze.zone](http://stargaze.zone/) via [Keplr Wallet](http://keplr.app/).\n\nPhase 3 is expected to be completed before the end of the year. Airdrops will be claimable starting in this phase.\n\n## Follow Us\n\nTo follow along with Stargaze developments, check us out on Twitter at <https://twitter.com/StargazeZone>, and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StargazeZone\n\n[https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE)\n\nHappy Stargazing ✨🔭", "timestamp": 1635207571, "digest": "h9Bc7jODUrYB1Jw4mve3QEGVkBwBsyVebN6NP7tRl_Y", "contributor": "0x57a9Cb03cC8Ed919162d9024710ca9E886346299"}

(Source: [GRAND VIEW RESEARCH](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/virtual-reality-vr-headset-market))\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fyyPcB_oZzW45nSbh3Ol1.png?height=314&width=606)\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in July 2021 that he would \"**make Facebook a metaverse company**.\"\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y1iOJj4be0Z9evSIY39Eu.png?height=578&width=800)\n\nAs you know, it was in March 2014 that Facebook acquired \"Oculus\", which was a representative of VR startups at that time, for 2 billion dollars. The data for 2020 is said to have been greatly influenced by \"Oculus Quest 2\", but it shows that **Oculus still has the top share and continues to be the center of VR** (in this article, we will analyze and consider the VR market with a focus on Oculus).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qNo20-r__n_o3pr2awrGT.png?height=514&width=560)\n\nSeven years have passed since then, and **it can be said that the VR market has returned with the buzzword \"metaverse,\" which means \"meta (transcendent) and universe (world)**.\"\n\n**Without an analysis of the VR market, the essence of the Metaverse cannot be understood.** So, this time, I would like to summarize in a note the path leading to \"Metaverse\" based on what is happening in VR now.\n\n## Exciting \"VR Startup\" Financing\n\n**Below is** **a table summarizing** \"**final round funding only**\" to see the most recent activity of funding for major VR startups since 2019.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e9bvQ6smCGvlu88ngo0a3.png?height=729&width=1105)\n\nIn the US, the leading social VR \"**Rec Room**\" has succeeded in large-scale procurement of $100M, and \"**VRChat**\" has succeeded in large-scale procurement of $80M. In addition, entertainment-related VR startups such as \"**Sandbox VR**\", which develops VR games and entertainment facilities, and \"**Wave**\", which develops VR live performances such as music, stand out.\n\n## Is \"VR not profitable\" true?\n\nIn the past, people in the startup area were whispering that \"VR is not profitable\", but is that true?\n\nThe official Oculus blog (as of February 2021) has some very interesting data. There were **69 apps with sales of $ 1M or more and 6 apps with sales of $ 10M or more**. The company is (daringly) comparing gray as of September 2020 and purple as of February 2021, just five months later.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JotJvDDcdRRWe5ZUacWDU.png?height=451&width=800)\n\nThe VR rhythm game \"**Beat Saber**\" has become a title with sales of over $10M in about a year and a half since its release, that is, **at a pace of $5-7M**.\n\nThe VR battle royale game \"**POPULATION: ONE**\" has achieved $10M in a few months since its launch, and if it is 3 months, **it is earning $20-40M annually**. You can see that (\\* Since there is an additional charge, it is calculated in the low range of the initial charge weight).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k3AJjzC9vdy8F-1i-Q0r_.jpeg?height=369&width=800)\n\nI think it's difficult to understand if you don't watch the VR market all the time, but you can see that the perception that **\"VR is not profitable\" is becoming misunderstood**, especially in the US.\n\nSo where can we get a hint of \"the way to the Metaverse\" from the analysis of the VR market? In fact, **you can see that the ranking of VR apps is really suggestive**.\n\n## Read \"VR App Ranking\"\n\nOculus has two rankings, \"Top Selling\" and \"Most Popular\". In fact, **there is a difference between high-selling apps and downloaded apps** (the \"ranking\" is as of August 1, 2021). Let's take a closer look.\n\n## Oculus Quest \"Top Selling\"\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/noX4XBKblSaCmQsy05gl5.png?height=294&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BcshGUMuVVndkQPB06IVy.png?height=878&width=1102)\n\nIt's easy to see that **there are many VR games that were released in 2019 accounting for half**. Many VR apps are paid apps regardless of genre, and it is presumed that new users will be ranked at the top of sales as they are by purchasing standard apps (\\* The above is probably a ranking that does not include additional charges).\n\nOn the other hand, three games released in 2021 are also ranked in, and you can see that new VR games are born and widely accepted by users.\n\nBy the way, **only 5 are ranked in the \"Sales Ranking\" and \"Download Ranking\" in duplicate. Why?** Let's take a look at the \"Download Ranking\" to solve your doubts.\n\n## Oculus Quest \"Most Popular\"\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9NLgkBWdDoXhzqH12aeP0.png?height=290&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vBw371A-oRUfdHpZ8ZKtA.png?height=877&width=1103)\n\nThe \"Download Ranking\" can be broadly classified into the following three categories.\n\n> **(1) Games**: Games that incorporate VR-like movements such as waving their arms and looking around 360 degrees, such as the VR rhythm game \"Beat Saber\" and the VR shooting game \"Onward\" mentioned above, are popular.\n\n> **(2) Communication**: Social VR apps that enjoy communication in virtual space, such as \"Rec Room\" and \"VR Chat\", which are raising large amounts of funds, are popular.\n\n> **(3) Utilities and other entertainment apps**: The only VR app other than games that was ranked in both DL and sales was the app \"Virtual Desktop\" for operating the desktop environment in the VR space. Although not in the ranking, photo and video viewer apps also fall into this category. In addition, \"YouTube VR\" is ranked as an entertainment application other than games.\n\nAmong these, I would like to pay attention to \"**(2) Communication**\" which keeps the top number of downloads in recent years.\n\n## **Bored in virtual world experience**\n\nSocial VR, such as 2nd place \"Rec Room\" and 4th place \"VR Chat\", is becoming a new trend.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FZxo84pxC0glr_AgY0eJp.png?height=224&width=800)\n\nBoth have characters on the platform and enjoy walking around the world and communicating with their friends. You don't have to be a real-world friend. It can be said that the social desire to \"talk to someone\" and \"want to interact\" is generating the number of downloads.\n\nThe location of \"where to meet\" is also important. There is a space called a room in \"Rec Room\" and a space called a world in \"VRChat\", and the implementation method depends on the platform, but developers and creators can create their own space.\n\nThere are spaces such as the streets of New York and Japanese gardens that have transformed the real world into virtual spaces, and there are spaces that cannot be experienced in the real world, such as the scenery of anime. It can be said that such an extraordinary space excites communication.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av8s5Gvg6iM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av8s5Gvg6iM)\n\nA virtual space experience is very important. But what if that continues forever? Whether it's New York, Tokyo, Egypt, or anime space, the moment when it changes from \"unusual to everyday\" will surely come. In other words, static content is \"sick\".\n\nSo how will social VR evolve?\n\nThe hint is the popular game \"Fortnite\" of the US Epic Games, which provides the game engine \"Unreal Engine\" that is also very active in VR application production.\n\n## **Charge for communication, not games**\n\nFortnite is a representative game of battle royale games along with \"PUBG\" and \"KNIVES OUT\". Compete to survive to the end in a specific stage.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xF_H0g4cEnAHhwiJK1nq0.png?height=396&width=800)\n\nOf course, the goal is to win, but that's not the only goal, and you can log in at the same time as your fellow gamers to form a team and play cooperatively while talking.\n\nWhen you are playing with your friends, it is close to \"**Communication > Game**\", and other players appear while you are talking to your friends, so it feels like you are shooting (defeating).\n\nIt's free to play, and the billing element is to decorate your avatar such as \"skins\", not because it makes it easier to defeat your enemies, but **because you enjoy communicating with your friends more**.\n\nTry on hairstyles that are embarrassing and impossible in the real world, try on flashy clothes and costumes of popular characters, and equip weapons with your favorite patterns. Just like your friends will notice you when you wear new clothes, compliment you when you change your hairstyle, and sometimes you'll be ridiculed if you have a wacky bag.\n\n\"Emotes (dance)\" is the best way to share the joy of winning with your friends.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhprWbyQD8&t=654s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhprWbyQD8&t=654s)\n\nFor such communication, we play the game and charge for it.\n\nIn freemium-type games, the purpose of additional charges varies from game to game. They can be broadly classified into **two types**.\n\n> **Efficiency type**: A kind of \"time saving type\" item that you have to wait for a certain period of time to challenge the next stage, and you can challenge immediately if you purchase a recovery item. Includes items (weapons, cards, etc.) to make you stronger. There are also many gachas.\n\n> **Avatar**: Customize the avatar with characters, item skins, etc.\n\nIn Fortnite, you cannot buy weapons to make it easier to clear the game. Even so, **it is said that many users make about $5 billion in sales by charging avatars to express themselves** (including non-skin charges).\n\n## \"Why do games and communication merge?\" Three reasons\n\nIn the history of smartphone games, when the App Store first appeared, buy-out games were the mainstream, but after that, freemium-type games became the top sellers.\n\nIn that sense, I think it was only natural that free-to-play games like \"Fortnite\" became popular all over the world. If you think so, **VR should change in the order of \"free download → billing\"**.\n\nThinking this way, **there are some interesting changes in two apps: VR games and social VR**. In other words, VR games that are sold out will move toward additional billing through \"communication,\" while free social VR will move toward \"games\" to incorporate billing factors.\n\nIn other words, **I think that the fusion of games and communication will accelerate even in VR**. In conclusion, I would like to summarize the reasons for the following three.\n\n**(1) There are precedent cases of rapidly growing \"games\" in the world**\n\n\"Fortnite\" isn't the only case where people were supposed to get together to play a game, but before they knew it, they got together to communicate. The same thing is happening with the popular US game platform \"Roblox\", which was listed in March 2021.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RTX6x4rQCfl3t_Im7lmaR.jpeg?height=250&width=512)\n\nMost of the fastest-growing games in the world have an element of \"communication\". We believe that this trend will accelerate in the VR market in the future.\n\n**(2) Communication requires topics**\n\nIt is actually a high hurdle to keep communicating synchronously all the time. **Appropriate “topics (contents and services)\" are required there**. The most powerful content is \"games\".\n\nOf course, depending on the person, it may be \"music,\" \"video,\" \"art,\" etc., but history proves that \"games\" are still the most profitable.\n\n**(3) Increasing needs for synchronous communication**\n\nI think that many people feel that conversations (especially synchronous communication) have decreased due to the increase in telework from 2020 due to the corona situation. In the questionnaire, 70.9% of respondents answered that \"conversation\" and \"chat\" were \"significantly reduced\" and \"decreased\" in telework compared to when they arrived at the office.\n\n**VR is a device with strong synchronization, and we believe that needs will increase in a world where synchronous communication has decreased**.\n\n## Finally\n\nWe believe that \"Game x Communication\" will grow significantly in the VR market as well. This is the future of digital entertainment, and there is no doubt that there is a \"metaverse\" beyond that. The definition of the metaverse varies from person to person, but it is certain that one of the important contents in the space is \"game\".\n\nHowever, looking at the trend of social VR, I felt that \"games\" are not indispensable, and that \"communication\" is the most important. I think that all kinds of content such as \"games,\" \"shopping,\" \"media,\" and \"business\" will be integrated there.\n\nPeople use the Metaverse to communicate.\n\nComic, animation, drama, movies, games, and any entertainment content that you can enjoy solo will end there, and content centered on communication elements and services will shine in the Metaverse era.\n\nSo what is the role of VR in the Metaverse?\n\nSwinging a sword, throwing something in your hand ... One of the features is operability that you can't experience with a smartphone. But **the most important essence is that there is \"immersive\"**. Vision overlooking 360 degrees, 3D avatars that can be someone else, virtual experiences that cannot be achieved in the real world.\n\n**VR with such an experience will be the best device and content to enjoy communication in the Metaverse era**.\n\nWe will continue to disseminate information centered on Entertainment Tech, so if you are interested in this article, please follow me on Twitter.\n\n[https://twitter.com/yujikumagai](https://twitter.com/yujikumagai)\n\nSee you next time!\n\n## Self-Introduction\n\n**Yuji Kumagai**  \n Crypto Investment Manager at Akatsuki\n\n**About Akatsuki Inc.**\nA Japanese digital entertainment company, went public in 2016.

{"id": "oLfv0fAE8nEAwcnEMylbq03aPZBg5XGF5HXwdJMPdOQ", "title": "STARS Token Distribution and Airdrop", "body": "Stargaze is one of the first NFT markets to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Cosmos is a network of custom interoperable blockchains. It is currently the second largest ecosystem by volume, and includes Terra, Cosmos Hub, Thorchain, and Osmosis.\n\nStargaze aims to be a decentralized NFT market, totally owned and governed by its users. Therefore, distribution of STARS has to be equitable, accessible, and cover a large surface area.\n\n## Token Release Schedule\n\nA fair initial distribution is pivotal in setting the future direction of a network. Paired with a thoughtful inflationary release schedule, a network can optimize its token distribution.\n\nThe distribution of STARS is designed to front-load inflation in order to bootstrap the network. This is a similar issuance schedule to Bitcoin. However, instead of halvings, issuance will be cut by 1/3 each year (by multiplying the current issuance by a reduction factor of 2/3). Osmosis was the first protocol to use a [“thirding” token release schedule](https://medium.com/osmosis/osmo-token-distribution-ae27ea2bb4db) and heavily inspired Stargaze’s design.\n\nFor some background on using token incentives to bootstrap new networks, check out this great [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619?s=20) by Chris Dixon.\n\n![\"Thirding\" release schedule](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TwRgLvwwmYuxQ8c4BqR3f.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nStargaze will start with an initial supply of 1 billion STARS. An additional 1 billion STARS will be issued the first year. With this \"thirding\" schedule, the issuance for the following year will be 667M STARS. This leads to an **asymptotic max supply of 4 billion STARS**.\n\n![Total supply formula](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4zhWsUYN9KbC12rOFyAZM.png?height=126&width=1284)\n\n![Issuance calculations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ooIF-U44MYirt21oEg4LL.png?height=1542&width=1630)\n\nStargaze starts off decentralized on day one with a genesis supply that distributes the majority of the tokens to community members. The Foundation will hold a strategic reserve of tokens, and will drive adoption of the protocol by delegating to validators, onboarding creators, and providing grants for ecosystem development.\n\n![Community-focused genesis supply](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZTtjhTqZNqm1rNESQq8j2.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter 5 years, the initial distribution is only 27.6% of the entire token supply. This issuance schedule allows Stargaze to grow and adapt its ownership to new creators, curators, validators, delegators, and other stakeholders.\n\n![Genesis supply vs. new issuance after 5 years](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k_VH9Rk86klZ7IXo2ZbKC.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nTokens for seed investors, validators, founders, and advisors are locked up for 1 year, and linearly vest after that for another 6 months - 1 year. This helps align values with the the development team and early stakeholders.\n\n## The Airdrop\n\nThe goal of the Stargaze airdrop is to reach the most active participants in the Cosmos ecosystem. Stakers and liquidity providers are more likely to be more active than just token holders. Therefore, Stargaze is doing its airdrop to a mix of network participants:\n\n* **ATOM stakers**\n* **OSMO stakers or liquidity providers**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Cosmos Hub**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Osmosis**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Regen Network**\n\nFor each role above, you will be able to claim **2,453 STARS**. Distributing a fixed amount is in the spirit of the original Uniswap airdrop, giving every user more or less an equal starting point. In order to claim your airdrop, you have to perform 4-5 actions on Stargaze when it launches. If you have used [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) or [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), you’re already familiar with performing tasks to claim tokens. Some claimable actions include bidding on NFTs, staking, and voting in governance.\n\nSome minimums were put in place to prevent dust accounts and those attempting to game airdrops:\n\n* **ATOM staker: 5 ATOM minimum staked**\n* **OSMO staker: 50 OSMO minimum staked**\n\nFurthermore, delegations to centralized exchange validators were excluded.\n\nFor example, if you’re an ATOM staker and OSMO LP, and meet the above minimums, then your airdrop reward is 4,906 STARS.\n\nOsmosis liquidity providers get the airdrop regardless if LP tokens are bonded or not.\n\nAirdrop claimable amounts start decaying 4 months after the launch of the NFT market. The decaying process linearly decreases the claimable amount for another 4 months.\n\n![Airdrop must be claimed to prevent decay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3_QgqhG1LETOtyBdL0a7P.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter the airdrop claim period, unclaimed STARS are sent to the Community Pool.\n\nSnapshots were taken on Oct 11th, 2021 from Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and Regen Network.\n\nTo see how much STARS you’re eligible to claim, please visit <https://stargaze.zone/airdrop>.\n\n***Note: Airdrops won’t be claimable until after Phase 3 of launch. Please see Phase 3 below.***\n\nhttp://stargaze.zone/airdrop\n\n## Reward Distribution\n\nNew token reward distribution will be optimized to facilitate the operations of the NFT market.\n\nThe initial breakdown per block will be:\n\n![Per block distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UzjJ1v4qZ-bF5zw1BY9kr.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAll chain parameters can be changed via governance vote. Everything suggested in this post are sensible defaults. We expect governance to adapt and change the protocol as it matures.\n\n### NFT Incentives\n\n45% of block rewards are set aside for NFT bidding and staking incentives. Token holders will be able to earn yield by bidding and staking on NFTs for certain periods of time. An upcoming post will outline this mechanic in detail.\n\nIf governance determines that NFT incentives are too high for achieving the desired effect of the protocol, they may direct these incentives towards the Community Pool where they can be spent later.\n\n### Staking Rewards\n\nAs per the course with proof-of-stake networks, validators (node operators) earn rewards for securing the network. They also accept delegations from token holders, and charge a commission of 5% or greater for providing the service.\n\nNearly 100 validators were selected to join mainnet after 3 testnets, 2 of which were incentivized. They will earn 35% of all block rewards.\n\n### Developer Rewards\n\nInitially, 15% of block rewards will go to fund the team that contributes to the development of Stargaze. Each account gets a specific weight set by governance. When a developer is no longer contributing, governance can choose to modify their weight or remove their allocation.\n\n### Community Pool\n\nThe Community Pool is the main DAO that operates the network. It is responsible for voting on parameter changes, software upgrades, community matters, and more. It will receive 5% of all block rewards.\n\n## Phased Launch\n\nSince Stargaze is a layer 1 blockchain with many moving parts, it will launch in phases.\n\n* **Phase 0: Chain launch with 0% inflation (Oct 29th)**\n* **Phase 1: Liquidity pools on [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and [Gravity DEX](https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/)**\n* **Phase 2: Governance proposal to enable inflation**\n* **Phase 3: Web app launch with first NFT drop**\n\nMore details about the liquidity pools will be forthcoming.

{"id": "CrPHzo3LoBQiR-LHEaYWIS7TvW5MKvlsRwXtcL5Qh-Q", "title": "Answers to Daonomics Questions", "body": "> **The idea that we need crypto policies hinges on two big assumptions. First, that DAOs will own stakes in other DAOs. Second, that if DAOs own other DAOs, then DAOs are at greater risk of being raided. Are both of these assumptions true?**\n\nDAOs will own stakes in their vendors’ DAOs because not doing so would prevent them from becoming an \"automated\" company.\n\nIf a DAO owns voting rights in their vendored DAO, they can write purchasing agreements into *code,* which prevents every transaction from being voted upon. If the vendor DAO does not give stakes, then the on-chain program that runs the purchaser DAO cannot trust the vendor.\n\nIn other words, the purchaser DAO can't create a public `sellUsYourProduct` function, because that function would become an exploit for another program to lie to the DAO about delivering goods and steal money.\n\nInstead, the DAO would have to pick a particular vendor and stick with them, effectively limiting competition and ensuring that the DAO is over-paying. In this system, the DAO is paying extra to \"trust\" the vendor; which makes sense in the old economy. But, owning DAO tokens makes it possible to *not* need to trust the vendor (because you have control over it), which allows a marketplace to spin up for that vendored product, reducing the prices you would be otherwise paying, plus not forcing votes all the time.\n\n> **Are crypto policies DAOs themselves, where actions are taken according to votes? Or are they fully code-based? Are they run automatically or are they invoked ad-hoc?**\n\nCryptopolicies are not DAOs. They are just a category of a smart contract, they don't have to be controlled by anyone.\n\nBut you could imagine a \"Lawfirm DAO\" that creates cryptopolicies (such as ones that remove bad actors in a supply chain) in exchange for the tokens of that supply chain.\n\nFor example, imagine you and I run coffee shop DAOs. We've discovered that our coffee roasters are both getting their beans from poor working conditions. You and I can collectively pool our CoffeeRoaster DAO tokens in a cryptopolicy which votes to boycott the PoorWorkingCondition DAO, or to fork the PoorWorkingCondition's DAO tokens, fire the management and rehire someone else.\n\nSome cryptopolicies could be automatic, and you could have smart contracts that create cryptopolicies.\n\n> **Have I understood correctly the virtues of a crypto policy? What am I missing?**\n\nA cryptopolicy isn't inherently good; but it does offer a solution to multiple potential problems in Daonomics.\n\nUnlike old-world policies; cryptopolicies allow for immediate and reservable action on previously difficult collective action problems, such as climate change. (Though, my assumption is that climate change will be solved in the existing market by falling clean energy prices and pre-existing government pressure).\n\nIn a collective action problem, each individual actor can't act alone. But in a cryptopolicy, you don't need to trust that other actors will operate in good faith; because blockchains allow you to pool your votes together without trusting a third party. All actors can act instantly only when the pool of people is large enough.", "timestamp": 1635208773, "digest": "_JTYsAPSRFAb_Qi3MrYDwLy033i-aJcdtc8VGru1ubY", "contributor": "0xC048a401b9419177Bc76Ca0174C6Df216e71Ca56"}

We added another field to the struct, which ends up increasing the amount of space we need.\n\nThe fix here is to look above to where it says `space = 8 + 8`. We can change that to `space = 8 + 8 + 8`, and run `anchor test` again, which will pass.\n\nWhat did we learn? We have to be careful about the space we allocate for our account data and make sure that we allocate the right amount of space. We have to allocate 8 bytes for the discrimnator, 8 bytes for data, and 8 bytes for another_data.\n\nLet's revert the changes we've made up to this point.\n\n## The Initialize accounts\n\nThe initialize accounts are defined here:\n\n    #[derive(Accounts)]\n    pub struct Initialize<'info> {\n        #[account(init, payer = user, space = 8 + 8)]\n        pub my_account: Account<'info, MyAccount>,\n        #[account(mut)]\n        pub user: Signer<'info>,\n        pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,\n    }\n\nSolana requires that we specify *all* the accounts that are used in the instruction handler because validators need to be able to operate on many accounts in parallel. Getting a mutable reference to an account will rqeuire blocking on any further changes to that account.\n\n## The system program account\n\nIf you look at the Initialize handler above, you'll notice that the system*program account is never explicitly used. However, try removing the system*program and the program won't compile. That's because we've defined, in this struct, `my_account` as an account that is to be initialized. As a result, anchor requires us to include the system*program because the system*program is the program capable of initializing accounts.\n\nIf we look at the Update accounts, we'll see that there is no system*program defined. That is because we are just updating that account's data and not initalizing it, so anchor doesn't require us to have access to the system*program.\n\n## The user account\n\nWe also don't explicitly use the user account in the instruction handler for Initialize. Let's try removing it (along with the `#[account(mut)])` attribute).\n\nThis won't compile either. That's because the account that's paying for the rent is the user, so we'll get a compilation error.\n\n#### Why does the user account have the mutable attribute?\n\nLet's re-add the user account line, but leave off the `#[account(mut)]` piece. This compiles, so let's run `anchor test`.\n\nThis actually works. I don't know if anchor test isn't testing all the constraints we expect, but I don't think this would work in a client setting. My expectation would be that this doesn't work because the user account needs to be mutable for the program to debit the account to pay for the space allocation.\n\n**Open question--don't quite get this...**\n\n#### The Signer struct\n\nThe Signer struct just tells anchor that the user account has signed the transaction. Anchor knows that it doesn't have to fetch or deserialize the data associated with this account.\n\n## my_account\n\nFinally, we have the account that actually holds the data for our program.\n\nWe've already covered the pieces of the attribute that this is tagged with, so let's look at the account itself.\n\n    pub my_account: Account<'info, MyAccount>\n\nThis tells anchor that we have an account here with data. Anchor should expect to deserialize the data into a MyAccount object, which we already went over.\n\n## The Update accounts\n\nVery simply, the Update instruction only requires one account, which is the original account that we stored the data in. This has the mutable attribute, because we want to be able to update the account data.\n\n## The instruction handlers\n\nFinally, we can move on to the instruction handlers!\n\nThese are virtually identical in how they are implemented in the code. They both take two parameters, take a mutable reference to my_account, and then update the data.\n\nWhat happens under the hood is very different though, and the differences are entirely because of the different account specifications.\n\nWhen we call initailize, anchor, under the hood, is making a call to the system program to initialize the account at my_account's address. Only after initializing the account does it update the data.\n\nThe update instruction takes an already initailized account with this type of data and just updates it.\n\nNote that we never have to \"commit\" our changes in any way. We use our mutable reference to the account's data and anchor will automatically update the account's data for us.\n\nThanks for reading this deep dive. I'll be continuing to do more deep dives on these anchor examples.\n", "timestamp": 1635211046, "digest": "-zx7o8b8a5-x8mgbnCjlau7VdmAmvqmR9kaMAhVg9ck", "contributor": "0x840B1dC2abb99f1F86D549303719610F346B2aaF"}

{"id": "Omx4vkk_tP2R9CEpO6QleRQDdAP0hoGZihHxuedxpe8", "title": "STARS Token Distribution and Airdrop", "body": "Stargaze is one of the first NFT markets to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Cosmos is a network of custom interoperable blockchains. It is currently the second largest ecosystem by volume, and includes Terra, Cosmos Hub, Thorchain, and Osmosis.\n\nStargaze aims to be a decentralized NFT market, totally owned and governed by its users. Therefore, distribution of STARS has to be equitable, accessible, and cover a large surface area.\n\n## Token Release Schedule\n\nA fair initial distribution is pivotal in setting the future direction of a network. Paired with a thoughtful inflationary release schedule, a network can optimize its token distribution.\n\nThe distribution of STARS is designed to front-load inflation in order to bootstrap the network. This is a similar issuance schedule to Bitcoin. However, instead of halvings, issuance will be cut by 1/3 each year (by multiplying the current issuance by a reduction factor of 2/3). Osmosis was the first protocol to use a [“thirding” token release schedule](https://medium.com/osmosis/osmo-token-distribution-ae27ea2bb4db) and heavily inspired Stargaze’s design.\n\nFor some background on using token incentives to bootstrap new networks, check out this great [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619?s=20) by Chris Dixon.\n\n![\"Thirding\" release schedule](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TwRgLvwwmYuxQ8c4BqR3f.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nStargaze will start with an initial supply of 1 billion STARS. An additional 1 billion STARS will be issued the first year. With this \"thirding\" schedule, the issuance for the following year will be 667M STARS. This leads to an **asymptotic max supply of 4 billion STARS**.\n\n![Total supply formula](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4zhWsUYN9KbC12rOFyAZM.png?height=126&width=1284)\n\n![Issuance calculations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ooIF-U44MYirt21oEg4LL.png?height=1542&width=1630)\n\nStargaze starts off decentralized on day one with a genesis supply that distributes the majority of the tokens to community members. The Foundation will hold a strategic reserve of tokens, and will drive adoption of the protocol by delegating to validators, onboarding creators, and providing grants for ecosystem development.\n\n![Community-focused genesis supply](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZTtjhTqZNqm1rNESQq8j2.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter 5 years, the initial distribution is only 27.6% of the entire token supply. This issuance schedule allows Stargaze to grow and adapt its ownership to new creators, curators, validators, delegators, and other stakeholders.\n\n![Genesis supply vs. new issuance after 5 years](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k_VH9Rk86klZ7IXo2ZbKC.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nTokens for seed investors, validators, founders, and advisors are locked up for 1 year, and linearly vest after that for another 6 months - 1 year. This helps align values with the the development team and early stakeholders.\n\n## The Airdrop\n\nThe goal of the Stargaze airdrop is to reach the most active participants in the Cosmos ecosystem. Stakers and liquidity providers are more likely to be more active than just token holders. Therefore, Stargaze is doing its airdrop to a mix of network participants:\n\n* **ATOM stakers**\n* **OSMO stakers or liquidity providers**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Cosmos Hub**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Osmosis**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Regen Network**\n\nFor each role above, you will be able to claim **2,453 STARS**. Distributing a fixed amount is in the spirit of the original Uniswap airdrop, giving every user more or less an equal starting point. In order to claim your airdrop, you have to perform 4-5 actions on Stargaze when it launches. If you have used [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) or [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), you’re already familiar with performing tasks to claim tokens. Some claimable actions include bidding on NFTs, staking, and voting in governance.\n\nSome minimums were put in place to prevent dust accounts and those attempting to game airdrops:\n\n* **ATOM staker: 5 ATOM minimum staked**\n* **OSMO staker: 50 OSMO minimum staked**\n\nFurthermore, delegations to centralized exchange validators were excluded.\n\nFor example, if you’re an ATOM staker and OSMO LP, and meet the above minimums, then your airdrop reward is 4,906 STARS.\n\nOsmosis liquidity providers get the airdrop regardless if LP tokens are bonded or not.\n\nAirdrop claimable amounts start decaying 4 months after the launch of the NFT market. The decaying process linearly decreases the claimable amount for another 4 months.\n\n![Airdrop must be claimed to prevent decay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3_QgqhG1LETOtyBdL0a7P.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter the airdrop claim period, unclaimed STARS are sent to the Community Pool.\n\nSnapshots were taken on Oct 11th, 2021 from Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and Regen Network.\n\nTo see how much STARS you’re eligible to claim, please visit <https://stargaze.zone/airdrop>.\n\n***Note: Airdrops won’t be claimable until after Phase 3 of launch. Please see Phase 3 below.***\n\nhttp://stargaze.zone/airdrop\n\n## Reward Distribution\n\nNew token reward distribution will be optimized to facilitate the operations of the NFT market.\n\nThe initial breakdown per block will be:\n\n![Per block distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UzjJ1v4qZ-bF5zw1BY9kr.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAll chain parameters can be changed via governance vote. Everything suggested in this post are sensible defaults. We expect governance to adapt and change the protocol as it matures.\n\n### NFT Incentives\n\n45% of block rewards are set aside for NFT bidding and staking incentives. Token holders will be able to earn yield by bidding and staking on NFTs for certain periods of time. An upcoming post will outline this mechanic in detail.\n\nIf governance determines that NFT incentives are too high for achieving the desired effect of the protocol, they may direct these incentives towards the Community Pool where they can be spent later.\n\n### Staking Rewards\n\nAs per the course with proof-of-stake networks, validators (node operators) earn rewards for securing the network. They also accept delegations from token holders, and charge a commission of 5% or greater for providing the service.\n\nNearly 100 validators were selected to join mainnet after 3 testnets, 2 of which were incentivized. They will earn 35% of all block rewards.\n\n### Developer Rewards\n\nInitially, 15% of block rewards will go to fund the team that contributes to the development of Stargaze. Each account gets a specific weight set by governance. When a developer is no longer contributing, governance can choose to modify their weight or remove their allocation.\n\n### Community Pool\n\nThe Community Pool is the main DAO that operates the network. It is responsible for voting on parameter changes, software upgrades, community matters, and more. It will receive 5% of all block rewards.\n\n## Phased Launch\n\nSince Stargaze is a layer 1 blockchain with many moving parts, it will launch in phases.\n\n* **Phase 0: Chain launch with 0% inflation (Oct 29th)**\n* **Phase 1: Liquidity pools on [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and [Gravity DEX](https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/)**\n* **Phase 2: Governance proposal to enable inflation**\n* **Phase 3: Web app launch with first NFT drop**\n\nMore details about the liquidity pools will be forthcoming. Please follow us on social media (links below) for updates. They are planned for 2-3 weeks after Phase 0, and have to go through governance to be funded via the Community Pool.\n\nNew tokens won’t be issued until after Phase 2, when inflation kicks in. At this time you’ll be able to stake STARS at [stargaze.zone](http://stargaze.zone/) via [Keplr Wallet](http://keplr.app/).\n\nPhase 3 is expected to be completed before the end of the year. Airdrops will be claimable starting in this phase.\n\n## Follow Us\n\nTo follow along with Stargaze developments, check us out on Twitter at <https://twitter.com/StargazeZone>, and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StargazeZone\n\n[https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Why don’t I have an airdrop? I staked ATOM.**\n\nThe airdrop is only available to those that staked with non-centralized exchange validators. Staking with the following centralized exchanges ***do not*** qualify: Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Huobi, CoinOne, and OKEX.\n\n**I staked 0.1 ATOM, where is my airdrop?**\n\nYou must have staked at least 5 ATOM or 50 OSMOS to qualify.\n\n**I had my Osmosis LP tokens unbonded on Oct 11th. Do I still qualify?**\n\nYes.\n\nHappy Stargazing ✨🔭", "timestamp": 1635221962, "digest": "h9Bc7jODUrYB1Jw4mve3QEGVkBwBsyVebN6NP7tRl_Y", "contributor": "0x57a9Cb03cC8Ed919162d9024710ca9E886346299"}

Past excesses in the emerging markets imploded.\n\nIt spread through first the currencies, bonds and then local stock markets. Financial contagion spread to world's real economies.\n\nMany people, far from the markets, suffered, starved, or died. There were bailouts, financial aid, austerity deals and interest rate cuts. The crisis faded, and a new fever began to spread.\n\nNetworks of the markets funded a new network, the Internet.\n\nMr. Market, high on bailouts, jumped off cliffs to build rockets on the way down.\n\nThe same networks which spread disaster last year, had a fever for the future.\n\nLike every year, this year had crises and tragedies, but it also had clues. The year’s clues included rockets and future tech giants.\n\nGoogle is founded in Menlo Park, California. Tencent is founded in Shenzhen, China. AOL bought Netscape for 4.2B USD. Microsoft was sued by the US DOJ and 20 US states for an antitrust case.\n\nIce was found in the Moon's polar craters, enough for a future colony. Japan launched a probe to Mars.\n\nA Russian rocket launched from Kazakhstan, carried the first part of the International Space Station, the 21 ton Zarya Module. The Space Shuttle Endeavour launches the first American section of the International Space Station, 'Unity'. It docks with Zarya.\n\nThe Beastie Boys released a hit, 'Intergalactic'.\n\nThe sky was not the limit.

We'll see.\"\n\n\"If they see we don't have the item on us, what happens?\"\n\n\"My guess is the recipient doesn't know either just like you were kept in the dark. I want you to know one more thing, I won't let anything happen to your Grandfather or family. But it's my job to take it back home.\"\n\nShe looked at me, realizing the danger of not delivering but she said nothing.\n\nThe Marketplace was busy, the locals were selling to regulars and visitors. There were performances and event feeds in the quieter pockets between the clusters of shops and tourist attractions.\n\nWe were both wearing tactical underneath, and I snuck on a few items from the diplomatic bag. I didn't ask for anyone from the regular detail at the consulate. I wasn't there long enough to know who to rely on.\n\nI'm sure most of the consulate's security staff was vetted but none of them served with me. That's the kind of help I wanted.\n\nWe'll play tourists, with a shoulder bag.\n\nI see a group walking through the crowd towards us. They walk different, and carry themselves the way my crew would.\n\nThey didn't just send one person.\n\n[https://audius.co/beaconbloom/rocket-381880](https://audius.co/beaconbloom/rocket-381880)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JceRpmXzj3A-FKXpGFA8O.png?height=1600&width=1200)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gXEuqkz1PcArbaAOpvEaH.png?height=1600&width=1200)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635226214, "digest": "T8rPpTkQX8tm4pS9omNlIGuIWGLYDGQLcBB27p3c8H4", "contributor": "0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f"}

Both creators and collectors benefit from noiseless on-chain marketplaces where they can safely nourish fertile links. \n\n## General Overview\n\nDriven by the burning desire to offer NFT enthusiasts the decentralized experience they deserve, **Nil’s initial contributors introduce the Nil DAO, a decentralized cooperative leveraging the Nil Protocol V1.** \n\nThis article will serve as an overview of the mechanism implied in the Nil V1. The journey is just beginning, and contributors are confident the Nil fair launch will ignite a powerful federating movement serving creators all around the world.\n\n## Essential Concepts\n\n**At the core of Nil resides the concepts of creator’s ownership over their platform in addition to permissionless curation.** \n\nOperating simultaneously on Nil, those parties unlock powerful leverage for participants,  among which curating activities serve the artists while offering them a considerable network of passionate collectors.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3frthlkDVDeo-njxxzuPH.png?height=1148&width=2560&&&size=large)\n\n## Artists\n\n* **Creators apply to join the Nil cohort.** To be labeled, their request needs to be supported by the curator’s community.\n* **Once part of the Nil cohort, creators enjoy the most creator-friendly launchpad.** Abstracting technical complexity, Nil offers them extensive distribution options: community granularity, pricing flexibility, time sequencing modularity, and more.\n* **Exploiting the_N_projects community,** Nil represents a built-in amplification network of collectors looking to collect and support creators in their journey.\n* Initially, **Nil DAO will not charge any primary fees.**\n* In addition to their sales revenues, **creators generate $NIL** proportionally to the support demonstrated by the N stakeholders. Creators gain ownership over the ecosystem they contribute to, the greater their input, the greater their holdings.\n* There is a premium for joining the Nil ecosystem early on. The earlier a creator releases on the platform, the greater the $NIL proportion they generate.  \n* \n* $ETH is the standard currency used to sell on Nil. Even tho, creators can choose to accept $NIL as a payment method, giving them **control over the $NIL supply as well as the $NIL demand.**\n* Nil Labeled creators finally enjoy a lifelong brand moat additionally to exclusive access to the Nil cohort and anechoic chambers for creators to prosper with their peers.\n\n## Curators\n\n* **Stake your N and $NIL to become a curator.** \n* **When staking tokens, curators generate Curating Power (CP).** \n* Curators spend their CP to support applying creators.

{"id": "hCOB0zTVQBNP3XzGTJxy6Rj7JxoNC0nkwsbBEfG3jEE", "title": "比特币不仅仅是一个想法，而是一种新的批判意识", "body": "个人对作为比特币本质力量与知识的征服\n\n「 自由是通过征服获得的，而不是通过礼物获得的。必须不断地、负责任地追求它。自由不是一种位于人之外的理想；它也不是成为神话的想法。更确切地说，这是寻求人类完成不可或缺的条件。」\n\n——保罗·弗莱雷，被压迫者教育学\n\n「 没有知识领域的相关构成就没有权力关系，也没有不以权力关系为前提并同时构成权力关系的知识 。」\n\n——米歇尔·福柯，《纪律与惩罚：监狱的诞生》\n\n教学法是一种方式，意味着有人开始理解一个主题。它是某人学习一门学科的方式、教授给他们的方式以及某人学习的所有更广泛的社会背景。不仅仅是学习、教学或理解；教学法涉及社会、历史、政治、经济、技术以及人们试图学习特定学科的所有其他情境。简而言之，我们可以称之为学习哲学。这对我们的背景很重要，因为比特币的教学法也是解放的教学法，两者都赋予我们对世界的全新理解，使我们的压迫不再可行。正是通过这个解密密码含义的钥匙，我们才能重塑世界。\n\n被压迫者教育学是 Paulo Freire 关于激进协作学习作为个人赋权主题的代表作的标题。在这本书中，弗莱雷解释了被压迫者和压迫者如何发现自己被通过教学手段运作的权力系统所奴役。被压迫者被教导他们太愚蠢、懒惰或虚弱而无法自助，他们必须向压迫者 「 学习 」 以减轻他们的痛苦。同样，压迫者也被困在这些权力体系中，因为他们被教导他们拥有 「 正确 」 的思想，只有通过教育、法律、经济等等级制度将他们的这些正确思想寄托给被压迫者。被压迫者将能够通过效仿压迫者来改变他们的处境。这两种角色和观点的关键在于，它们都依赖于首先将自己和他人视为对象，其次才是人。因为只有一次你意识到所有人首先都是具有意识和批判能力的人；你也可以理解，这些权力系统可能会因为关键的所有人都有潜力的意识和个人能动性。\n\n这种权力是个人通过获取知识来认识他们的个人能动性和权力的批判意识，这是最大的秘密。它的奇异力量，我们有作为人的生命，这是唯一的一种内源性的现象可以从内被发现。这一发现清除了所有存在可能用来强迫自己拥有权力意志的可能性，以及团结是尊重他者作为 「 我无权控制的存在 」 的任务。\n\n只有当我们了解人类是具有批判性能力的生物，而我们每个人作为我们在世的引擎时，才被这种批判性能力所激励；我们能否也开始了解我们每个人内在的自我实现能力。这是个人的秘密发现，一旦我们知道它的存在，我们就可以培养和扩大自己内在的这种力量，成为我们征服世界的力量。正是通过对我们机构和其他机构的这种认可，我们才能用可以给予的最伟大的礼物——比特币来使我们俩有尊严。\n\n比特币不仅仅是一个想法，而是当今世界的一种权力机构。对未来自由的唯一希望，超越我们称之为法定货币的最后一丝奴隶制。\n\n理解的力量真相机器\n\n比特币是不可篡改的无坚不摧的能量机器，誓言不能被打破。它提供并保证了这个星球上没有其他任何东西可以提供的保护。它是对真理在我们堕落的世界中意味着什么的承诺，也是它此时毫不掩饰地重新发现的结果。通过我们自己对这个真理机器的每一个个人发现以及它对我们作为被奴役人民的个人意义，我们是否也了解它的弥赛亚力量 . 我们明白，通过比特币和密码学，我们可以恢复一种古老的权力形式，这将使我们不仅有能力征服国家；而是为即将到来的新时代组织起来。正是真理让我们超越了我们相信的极限，因为我们对他者的爱灌输给我们的勇气——这是最深的团结。\n\n一旦你明白，我们每个人内心深处的力量都是一种深奥的发现，它被揭开激活，即批判意识，即追求真理；你也可以开始明白这种力量是如何无限的。正是这个隐藏在我们每个人内心深处的秘密，拥有打破国家控制催眠的力量，它的权威凌驾于真理之上。知道您可以将自己从集中营中解放出来，并且可以出于所有原因中最宽宏大量的原因，以最可怕的方式杀死头脑中的警察，这是一种授权：你自己的自由。\n\n当前的国家社会范式依赖于一个谨慎的纪律执行系统，每个人都受到怀疑，每个人都是潜在的罪犯，以创建一个全景式的纪律系统，每个人和一切都受到监控。需要明确的是，这远远超出了警察的权力，而是与现代经济和金融体系融合在一起的整个监管体系，教会了我们自己的压迫，成为我们自己的警察。\n\n这就是警察如何进入你的头脑并被允许在那里殖民；让你犹豫，因为你不知道你是否被监视；等待被击中而不是准备反击。这是因为我们失去了我们的个人能动性，不再将自己视为光与爱的主权存在，而是身体可以被残酷摧毁的公民主体。我们不再被教导要思考，而是要遵守。不是创造，而是工作。不是自由，而是恐惧。我们已经成为一个陷害、骚扰和残害我们存在的奴隶。我们不再是自由的人，而是一个可怕的科学实验出错的残余；很久以前被清算的失败民主的产物。\n\n我们被告知，如果我们只是听从比我们更了解的专家的建议，我们将获得与他们相同的权力。然而，一旦我们开始质疑这些「正确」方式的合法性，我们就可以开始看到和理解一种完全不同的权力形式，这种权力形式不是提供服从而是提出质疑。正是这种勇敢的质疑行为，康德称之为 「 Sapere Aude （敢于知道）」 这允许从内部培养一种新形式的批判意识。这使个人能够找到他们在自己内部重新发现的真正权力所在，从而成为他们注定要成为的秘密人物。这种在人们内部唤醒的新批判意识允许创造新形式的批判性提问，Freire 称为 「 conscientização 」 或意识提升。（可以百度查询词语意思）\n\nConscientização 然后成为我们在信息技术、货币历史和最重要的密码学方面所需的工具，以提高我们的批判意识，首先将比特币理解为一种解放工具。因为只有当我们以一种扩大我们权力的方式进行批判性质疑时，我们才会开始变得具有自主权。只有当我们对比特币是什么、它如何加密来保护我们、为什么去中心化允许比特币具有反脆弱性以及对当今世界产生什么后果有了批判性认识时，我们才会开始围绕我们与技术的关系建立责任感，以及我们如何使用比特币使其成为免费的。\n\n正是有了这种关于如何使用这种技术知识作为个人力量的新意识，我们现在有了一个选择：\n\n使用奴役你的技术，或了解解放你的技术。\n\n这是你一个人的选择。\n\n凭借在信息时代发现个人知识的精湛技术，一个人可能会再次成为他们领域的主人。具有比特币和密码学如何运作的具体知识，以及互联网和隐私如何保护我们的更广泛知识；我们开始理解这些知识在当今世界意味着什么的真正后果。我们开始看到密码学的承诺以及它的纪律和礼仪为人类提供了什么是一种前所未有的新承诺。有了这些知识，我们就可以开始在我们自己内部培养一种新的意识形式，它超越了任何存在的国家或外部力量的认可或权力。这就是我所说的 「 加密主权 」 一词的意思。关于加密主权的内容，可参照《网络空间独立宣言》文章中的描述。\n\n通过我们对比特币的整体理解，我们的意识以这样一种方式被提升，通过其革命性的实践，即比特币的知识，揭示了对货币、金融、财富、价值和权力的完全不同理解的秘密。比特币的这种实践在被充分理解后，允许任何人——无论其政治种姓、宗教信仰或出生地——重新获得最基本的共性，即财产所有权。这是一种超越任何现代社会或政治机构权力的权利。然而，要理解这意味着什么，我们必须首先问「什么是财富？」这个问题。为了让我们对它是什么以及它如何运作有一个批判性的意识。\n\n知识共同体\n\n财富是一个远远超出简单金钱的概念，而是与主权秩序本身的安全有关。曾经只有超越法律的主权者才能提供安全和保障的承诺，因为他们制定了法律。通过交换臣民完全服从君主，他们可以对联邦的秩序及其安全和保障充满信心和尊重。这是主权者对所有臣民平等地履行其对法律的共同性和正义的血缘的承诺的保证。如果没有这种安全保障，任何其他保障都是空洞且毫无意义的，包括金钱。这更好地被霍布斯推测为：\n\n「 臣民对君主的义务被理解为持续时间与他能够保护他们的权力一样长，但不会更长。因为正确的人天生就必须保护自己，当没有其他人可以保护他们时，就不能放弃盟约。」\n\n——霍布斯，利维坦\n\n当我们开始以更全面的方式批判性地考虑财富的概念时，我们可以看到财富不仅仅包括金钱，甚至不仅仅是法律所假设的保证；而是直接实现的一种形式。这是任何国家、机构或个人都无法提供的承诺或誓言的利害关系。当我们考虑在这种情况下比特币必须为我们提供什么，超越国家或当代银行和金融的秩序，它揭示了一种全新的、不同的财富形式。正是在这里，我们看到了认可的闪光，它允许一种全新的意识形式，创造这种新的财富公式，即比特币。\n\n未来城邦的 Bitcoin\n\n「 如果每个宗教、道德、经济、伦理或其他对立面都足够强大，可以根据朋友和敌人有效地将人类分组，那么它就会转变为政治对立面。政治不存在于战斗本身，其中。拥有自己的技术、心理和军事规律，但在由这种可能性决定的行为方式中，通过清楚地评估具体情况，从而能够正确区分真正的朋友和真正的敌人。」\n\n——卡尔施密特，论政治概念\n\n通过密码学知识的共性以及它必须如何与可以被验证为真实的数学陈述一起运行，一个全新的世界向人类以及他可以通过使用该技术的双方同意的非暴力协议创造的可能性打开。现在可以具体评估谁是真正的朋友和真正的敌人。当财富不再仅与物质对象和国家合法所有权挂钩时；但对财富可以和应该是什么的更广泛的想法敞开了大门，我们开始了解比特币的真正力量。正是互联网的这种新的社会公地包含友谊，即这种财富的新公地。这是规则的共性，而不是统治者；协议，而不是王子；验证，而不是信任，创造了比特币这个新的共同体。\n\n「commonwealth」的词根包含财富，这绝非巧合。「Res Publica」（公共事物）是 commonwealth 一词的词源，也称为共和国，这也并非巧合。因为财富是我们只能在我们的社会中共同拥有的东西，因为只有通过与他人的社会协议，以及这些协议的力量，我们才能找到财富真正的安全保障。财富必须在上下文中被社会的其他成员理解和认可，才能使其发挥任何价值的作用。换句话说，财富是我们一致同意的价值衡量标准；或被强制执行。\n\n这是我们必须运用批判性思想的后一点。我们中有人曾经同意如何创造、分配和控制金钱吗？我想不是。当我们被要求与法定货币进行交易时，我们对通货膨胀率、发行量甚至拒绝法定货币的权力有任何发言权吗？再说一次，我认为不是。假设创造我们共享财富的假设共性表明它的真正性质不是双方同意，而是被迫服从。法定货币唯一真正的共同点是它对所有人的普遍压迫手段。这是一种只有拥有腐败金钱的人才可以分享的贫困；赤贫和腐败构成的共性。\n\n即使是最富有的法定所有者也可能不会随意花钱或随心所欲地花钱。每花掉一分钱，政府就会目瞪口呆，不耐烦地等待他们从交易中分得一杯羹，他们如此狡猾地称之为 「 税收 」。如果要购买被禁止的物品，进行未经授权的交易，人们就会冒着被关在笼子里并以最可怕和最有辱人格的方式受到惩罚的风险——仅仅因为不遵守政府的要求而沦为国家的奴隶无缘无故地服从比服从更多。这个针对法定货币的简单练习向我们表明，我们的财富并不是真正属于我们的，而只不过是一个基于许可的系统，可以获取生活资料（即财产）的权利。任何可能需要生存的商品，都必须首先被国家 「 列入白名单 」 ，并批准我们使用。\n\n从这个理解权力的角度来看，我们可以看到密码学开启了一种壮观的新权力形式，只能被称为剥夺权力。这不是一种法律权力，甚至也不是一种经济影响力或一种社会原则；但它是一种通过退缩和拒绝创造的权力的总体形式。尽管采取了 「 我宁愿不这样做 」 的行动，但仍要遵循书写者巴特比（Bartleby the Scrivener）的弥赛亚之路。正是通过这种拒绝参与的力量，因为我们了解比特币提供了什么，我们才能以更好、更适合我们这个时代的形象重建世界。\n\n简而言之，正如乔治·阿甘本 ( Giorgio Agamben) 所指出的那样，我们可以说：\n\n「如果革命和起义对应于制宪权，即建立和构成新法律的暴力，那么为了思考一个被剥夺的权力， 我们必须完全想象其他策略， 其定义是未来政治的任务。刚刚被暴力推翻的权力将以另一种形式再次崛起，在制宪权和构成权之间不断、不可避免的辩证法中，暴力制定法律，暴力维护法律。」\n\n—什么是毁灭力量？\n\n正是我们发现隐藏在密码学中的这种新的废权力公式也允许采用完全不同的金钱、权力和法律策略。然而，让这种全新的权力形式发挥作用的最关键方面是敢于问「为什么？」这个问题。因为如果我们找不到为自己思考的勇气，那么一切都将失去。我们必须有勇气质疑提供给我们的金钱、财富、法律和权力体系，并从勇敢逻辑的真诚基础上质疑这个体系。正是凭借这种激进的教育学力量，我们找到了能够唤醒我们内在火花的批判性工具，即我们的力量，我们的批判意识。因为只有一次我们才能看到有可能将自己从法定货币的锁链中解脱出来，庞大的剥削制度不要求我们思考，只要求我们服从；我们会实现自由。只有当我们可以自由选择时，我们才有办法开始质疑这种生活方式、这种权力体系、这些法律和金钱。当我们看到有选择的时候，我们就会发现一种超越国家权力和控制的生活中隐藏的秘密——一种只属于我们自己的生活。\n\n通过对比特币的激进个人发现，作为对我们当前货币、财富和权力体系的批判；一种新的批判意识被创造出来。今天，当地球上任何一个人开始以最批判的眼光看待财富，并对比特币所承诺的根本可能性持开放态度时，就会唤醒希望。正是我们在比特币中发现的真相让我们再次勇敢地生活在这个世界上，因为我们知道真相是这个世界的真实事物，具有价值，其他人也能看到它。",

After PolkaIDO, Polkadex Orderbook will be thoroughly tested by beta testers in different phases rolled out in different versions. Each version will be released as a new update for beta testers and afterwards rolled out to the public Testnet. Each update will have more and more functionality. After the beta testing of Polkadex Orderbook starts, the final component of the 3 initial components that currently make up the Polkadex vision, Polkapool, will be launched to beta testers.\n\n[https://medium.com/polkadex/understanding-polkadex-polkadex-101-97f8957bae88](https://medium.com/polkadex/understanding-polkadex-polkadex-101-97f8957bae88)\n\n[https://medium.com/polkadex/polkaido-launchpad-overview-728bd40effd6](https://medium.com/polkadex/polkaido-launchpad-overview-728bd40effd6)\n\n[https://medium.com/polkadex/understanding-polkadex-polkadex-101-97f8957bae88](https://medium.com/polkadex/understanding-polkadex-polkadex-101-97f8957bae88)\n\n[https://medium.com/polkadex/understanding-polkadex-polkadex-101-97f8957bae88](https://medium.com/polkadex/understanding-polkadex-polkadex-101-97f8957bae88)\n\n[https://medium.com/polkadex/understanding-polkadex-polkadex-101-97f8957bae88](https://medium.com/polkadex/understanding-polkadex-polkadex-101-97f8957bae88)\n\n[https://medium.com/polkadex/understanding-polkadex-polkadex-101-97f8957bae88](https://medium.com/polkadex/understanding-polkadex-polkadex-101-97f8957bae88)\n\n[https://medium.com/polkadex/understanding-polkadex-polkadex-101-97f8957bae88](https://medium.com/polkadex/understanding-polkadex-polkadex-101-97f8957bae88)\n\n[https://medium.com/polkadex/understanding-polkadex-polkadex-101-97f8957bae88](https://medium.com/polkadex/understanding-polkadex-polkadex-101-97f8957bae88)\n\nAny future products and updates will be tested through the beta tester program before following a similar launch schedule.\n\n## The importance of beta testing\n\nThe importance of the beta tester program cannot be understated. A constant feedback loop between the Polkadex devs and the beta testers in the final stages of development is crucial for the Polkadex vision to come to life. Beta testers will be incentivized to maintain a high level of quality testing with a generous rewards program. In addition, this marks the first overall release of a component that is part of the Polkadex vision. While many components are yet to be released to beta testers, then the Testnet, and finally, the Mainnet, this is a significant step in the Polkadex release schedule. All in all, the purpose of the beta tester program will be to create a cycle of rigorous testing, open communication, and prompt reiteration that will allow us to make the best version of Polkadex, together.\n\n> *While we can’t wait to launch all the different components of Polkadex to the Polkadex Mainnet, we’re super excited to work together with beta testers to make Polkadex the best it can be.

Is it having a lot of friends? Is it having the latest Tesla model? The meaning of life is the impact we have on people’s lives. It is the only path that should guide us.\n\n### Creating a Smart Society\n\nA [2017 paper](https://hbr.org/2017/10/the-smart-society-of-the-future-doesnt-look-like-science-fiction) by Bhaskar Chakravorti and Ravi Shankar Chaturvedi of The Fletcher School at Tufts University defines a Smart Society as:\n\n> *“A society where digital technology, thoughtfully deployed, can improve on three broad outcomes: the well-being of citizens, the strength of the economy, and the effectiveness of institutions.”*\n\nPerhaps what is flawed, and therefore incendiary, about the idea of ​​progress is that it implies a destiny — an endpoint. The truth is that while we can make powerful breakthroughs that improve living conditions for all of us, there is *no predetermined endpoint to human affairs*.\n\nInstead, the story is best viewed as an *ongoing struggle* to make those breakthroughs. There is no destination. There is no final destination. There is only a process of continuous renewal. Events like this pandemic are a reminder, a relatively small reminder by historical standards, of that truth. \n \n\nNow, it seems to me, the new world we have built **demands a new value system**. In our struggle to build a better home for ourselves, we have created a world system unlike anything that has ever existed before. If freedom was the value at the heart of our socio-economic system in the 20th century, then today we must build a new system that addresses the central fact of this new world: *interconnectedness.*\n\nIt is increasingly clear that global interconnectedness, and the overwhelming complexity to which it gives rise, is the central challenge of the coming decades. Today, an economic crisis, a supply chain disruption, and a viral outbreak in one part of the world has almost instantaneous ripple effects for the entire system; meanwhile, global warming does not respect borders.\n\nWe must build **social and political modes** that allow us to remain open to the incredible benefits of global interconnection while doing more to protect ourselves from harm. This means embracing collaboration and adopting new thoughts on how the individual citizen relates to the collective, and how the local relates to the global.\n\nYes, we must preserve the heritage that liberal democracy has left us: freedom, tolerance, the dignity of the individual. But we must also recognize that uninhibited individualism, and the liberal fantasy of a borderless global system, exposes us to new dangers and is out of step with the way most people understand their own lives.\n\nChanges to create smarter cities must begin with a simple reaffirmation of ourselves. That is, a reminder that the social and economic systems we build are there to serve us, and not the other way around.\n\nWe must find new ways to prioritize those around us over the phone screen, the news feed, and the stock price. Within the vast complexity that we now inhabit, we must find new ways to return to each other.\n\n*After all, in the end, the only thing left for us is each other.*", "timestamp": 1635245330, "digest": "otCoWE8TkzMq8nvLFPbdBRalpjrYCs4LI1BKiE60ftg", "contributor": "0x3fea0952d46786D1DeB1Ae657353F4ae3A4bbB1E"}

"![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CrVf7xaR5W6VHnDAxvSwv.png?height=675&width=1200)\n\n欢迎大家！Biconomy X COINKO专访时间终于到了！\n\n### COINKO：\n\n大家好，我是 Jerome Kim，今天的采访由我来主持！\n\n今天 Biconomy 的首席运营官兼联合创始人 Aniket Jindal 将谈论多链中继器和 Web 3 的未来。\n\n在我们开始之前，Aniket，请自我介绍一下！\n\n### Biconomy：\n\n当然。所以，我是 Biconomy 的首席运营官兼联合创始人。我一直在加密有点长。我在这个领域已经超过 5 年了。2016 年我在上海学习时开始了我的加密之旅。 从那时起，我一直戴着多个帽子，从营销到投资等。\n\nBiconomy 于 2018 年末开始，当时我和我的联合创始人正在努力使用 dApp，并意识到如果我们想让它成为主流，需要有更好的方法。\n\n我们都同意加密很复杂，在 2018 年甚至更复杂。我们希望让 dapp 能够轻松地为主流受众带来简单的体验\n\n### COINKO：\n\n你的记录很有趣！你的加密职业所谓的“OG”记录简直令人难以置信。这就是为什么许多人对您的项目抱有良好预期的原因。\n\n能否请先遇到你项目的用户简单介绍一下Biconomy？\n\n### Biconomy：\n\nBiconomy 提供即插即用 API，使 web3.0 用户友好且无摩擦。\n\n我们的使命是让每个人都可以访问去中心化的网络。我们是下一个十亿人采用加密货币的缺失部分。我们的 API 和 SDK 将任何 dAapp 转换为可供任何人使用，无论他们的加密知识和经验如何。我们的多链中继器基础设施每天为 70 多个 DApp 处理近 5 万笔交易，以确保 web3.0 的所有优势与 web2.0 的直观性相结合。\n\n我们想让 dapp 体验类似于普通的 web 2.0 应用程序\n\n### COINKO：\n\n伟大的！是的，普通用户不需要了解后台技术。但是，考虑到最近的Facebook宕机事件和TikTok数据泄露事件，数据主权越来越受到重视，Web 3的技术进步在所难免。我希望Biconomy能成为一个抓住可用性、技术和UX三只兔子的项目。\n\n现在，让我问你一些来自 COINKO 的关于 Multichain Relayer 和 Web 3 未来的问题。\n\n### COINKO议程问答\n\n### COINKO：\n\n首先，目前区块链生态中有很多独特的主网项目，而且还有更多的Dapp在上面。随着行业的发展，技术必须回归，易用性必须在前。现在，用户在使用 Dapp 产品时很难链接，似乎更强调了跨链项目的重要性。\n\n因此，现在有各种各样的跨链桥和多链产品。Biconomy 与它们相比有哪些优势？\n\n### Biconomy：\n\n在跨链桥方面，我们是速度最快的桥。用户在 ETH 和 Polygon 之间移动的平均时间为 60-120 秒！我们也便宜很多。这些优势源于我们的产品架构设计方式。\n\n另一方面是我们更多地将其视为一种无缝的多链体验，而不仅仅是跨链桥梁。因此，我们的其他产品和功能（例如无气体交易、以任何代币支付 gas 的灵活性）补充了跨链桥连字符。用户在任何链上都有简单的体验，我们改进了整个旅程。这也是一种与市场上其他参与者截然不同的方法。\n\n### COINKO：\n\n其次，Dapp 提供商目前正在考虑费用结构，因此有时变得过于昂贵的费用对他们来说是一种负担。在这种情况下，您有非常有趣的产品，例如“Gasless”、“Foward”和“Hyphen”。如果他们能够通过“Foward”和“Hyphen”的结合，有选择地采用低gas成本的链并支付费用，那么我们梦想的Web3优化就不会太远。你能详细解释一下吗？\n\n### Biconomy：\n\n对，就是这样！使用 Biconomy，用户可以获得简单的多链体验，将钱包连接到任何 dApp，立即在任何链或 L2/rollup 上访问他们的资金，并享受完全无气体的体验。我们为用户处理所有区块链难题，因此他们发现 web3.0 与 web2.0 一样简单直观。\n\n### COINKO：\n\n最后，请描述您提高整个市场采用率的策略，并描述您对不知道为什么要选择您的用户的渴望。\n\n### Biconomy：\n\n我们已经有 70 多个 dApp 合作伙伴集成。我们计划在年底前将其增加到 100。我们的策略是整合越来越多的链，支持更多的代币，并将我们的覆盖范围扩大到所有主要的 Dapp。随着 dApp 转向不同的第 2 层和汇总，我们的元交易基础设施需求将增长。我们计划积极利用这一趋势，确保我们成为多链 web3.0 中的重要一环。\n\n### COINKO：\n\n感谢您的详细解答。现在，是时候进行用户问答环节了！所有获奖者每人将获得 20 USDT！\n\n### Biconomy：\n\n非常感谢您的关注。我想对那些没有被选中回答这个问题的人表示感谢。现在，我们走！\n\n### 用户问答\n\n### COINKO：\n\n> ***第一季度@aqsarahmed***\n>\n> Biconomy*的独特之处是什么？*\n\n### Biconomy：\n\nBiconomy 的存在是为了通过强大的功能实现卓越的体验：\n\n* 免费的无气体交易\n* 即时跨链转账\n* 支付gas的灵活选择，因此以USDT等方式支付gas。\n* 保证交易成功，无失败交易\n* 简单的即时入职扩展解决方案\n* 自动连接到任何 L2 和 EVM 兼容链\n* 便宜且即时的跨链合约调用\n\n还有更多即将推出！\n\n### COINKO：\n\n> ***Q2 @Saheenkuruvann***\n>\n> *aBico 是多链中继基础设施双经济的原生代币，bico 的各种用例是什么？bico 持有者可以参与治理系统吗？*\n\n### Biconomy：\n\n是的，$BICO 是我们多链中继器基础设施的原生工作和治理代币。它通过充当网络费用、激励所有利益相关者保护和维护网络以及参与网络治理，在分散网络方面发挥着关键作用。\n\n所以在用例方面：\n\n* 参与者支付 $BICO 作为交易费与 Biconomy 网络交互\n* 节点运营商（验证者和执行者）必须投入 $BICO 才能开始为网络做出贡献。\n* 委托人可以质押他们的 $BICO 代币以进一步保护网络。\n* 节点运营商、委托人和流动性提供者获得 $BICO 奖励\n* 代币持有者可以参与治理\n\n### COINKO：\n\n> ***第三季度@LoLi_BB***\n>\n> *能否谈谈Biconomy未来的规划？*\n\n### Biconomy：\n\n* 我们正在积极开展业务发展以吸引越来越多的客户。我们计划达到 150 个客户/Dapps 和 100k+ 每日交易。\n* 我们正在积极增加对更多连锁店的支持。以便我们可以在所有主要链上促进更好的用户体验。\n* 对于连字符，我们将添加更多硬币和更多链。因此，在所有主要层 1 和层 2 之间传输一长串顶级令牌。还集成在 Dapps 中。\n* 在全球营销方面，我们正在寻找大使、内容创作者和社区建设者。加入我们的 discord 以了解更多信息：[https](https://discord.gg/F7qez7XFrN) : [//discord.gg/F7qez7XFrN](https://discord.gg/F7qez7XFrN)\n* 展望未来，将为代币持有者推出质押计划和流动性挖掘计划。\n\n### COINKO：\n\n> ***Q4 @quynhanhshy***\n>\n> *许多新项目都有风险，并且容易受到智能合约错误和漏洞的影响。您能否向我们保证您的平台安全已采取哪些措施，您是否进行了任何审核？*\n\n### Biconomy：\n\n我们所有的产品都经过审核。我们也是非托管的，所以我们不处理用户资金。我们与一家顶级安全公司 halborn 签订了长期合同。我们将定期获得漏洞赏金。\n\n### COINKO：\n\n> ***Q5 @P_M_D_E***\n>\n> *是否计划与 Terra 生态系统进行互操作？如果有，什么时候？*\n\n### Biconomy：\n\n是的！我们肯定会很快添加 Terra 支持。希望你很快就会在 Terra 上的 Dapps 上看到 Biconomy ;)\n\n### COINKO：\n\n> ***Q6 @vominh1919***\n>\n> *BICO的使命是什么？*\n\n### Biconomy：\n\n我们的主要任务是使 web3.0 无摩擦和无缝。这将在使 web3.0 和加密成为主流方面发挥重要作用。我们想让整个生态系统更具互操作性和可用性。\n\n这就是我们所热衷的。\n\n### COINKO：\n\n> ***Q7 @朴广根***\n>\n> *币项目的重要内容之一是与VC的合作，后者投资了Biconomy，而Biconomy团队对它更感兴趣，因为有许多著名的投资者，如Coinbase、Binance和火币创投。请介绍更多与投资Biconomy的VC合作！*\n\n### Biconomy：\n\n我们为拥有顶级投资者和合作伙伴而感到自豪和谦卑。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/C_nNXVJoBP-Qkno6ZUW7D.png?height=418&width=700)\n\n我们的一些投资者包括 Mechanism Capital、Eden Block、Binance、火币、Coinbase Ventures、Fenbushi 等。我们还有 15 个以上的顶角，例如来自 Aave 的 Stani、Polygon Founders 等等。\n\n### COINKO：\n\n> ***Q8@ebisu95***\n>\n> *我研究过biconomy在交易中完全消除了gas费用，那么在当前网络上交易时所需的费用如何补偿？谢谢 ！*\n\n### Biconomy：\n\n好问题！基本上我们允许 Dapps 自己为他们的用户赞助费用。因此，虽然用户不支付任何费用，但由 dapp 支付。然后他们可以像 web2 应用程序一样向用户收取订阅费来支付它。或者如果费用足够低，大多数 dapps 不介意覆盖 gas，因为它使用户体验更好。\n\n### COINKO：\n\n> ***Q9 @elmismositio123***\n>\n> *我有机会参加吗？*\n\n### Biconomy：\n\n是的！您可以作为大使和内容创建者成为社区的一员。很快您就可以购买 $BICO 并质押它以获得奖励。您还可以运行节点来赚取 $BICO。您还可以提供不同链中各种代币的流动性，以赚取 APY 和 $BICO。随着我们逐步去中心化，任何人都可以做出贡献并参与到网络中。\n\n###

That process allows the White House to protect some records that may be privileged without formally blocking their release.\n\nThe letter from Remus came two weeks after the White House said it would not block an earlier, more sweeping tranche of documents after Trump sought to shield them. Biden has made clear that he does not want to block the committee's work, and Remus wrote in both letters that the documents could “shed light on events within the White House on and about January 6 and bear on the Select Committee’s need to understand the facts underlying the most serious attack on the operations of the Federal Government since the Civil War.”\n\nStill, the White House's desire to shield some documents shows that the process of approving releases to the Jan. 6 committee won't always be simple, as presidents have long relied on their ability to assert executive privilege to protect their internal communications and deliberations. Biden's decisions to release certain documents could set precedents for future administrations and could eventually apply to his own records when he is out of office.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesman for the Jan. 6 panel said that lawmakers welcomed Biden's decision to allow the production of the two additional sets of records and that the committee had agreed to “defer action” on certain records.\n\n“The [Select Committee](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/select-committee) has not withdrawn its request for those records and will continue to engage with the executive branch to ensure we get access to all the information relevant to our probe,” said spokesman Tim Mulvey.\n\nEven though Biden has approved the release of most of the documents, their ultimate fate will now be decided by the courts.

That is probably not the kind of history Biden hoped to make when he secretly met with White House chroniclers in March and asked them how to be a \"consequential\" president like FDR.  \n\nWhy has the country turned against Uncle Joe? Simple: Biden is ignoring voters’ concerns. \n\nVoters are worried about inflation, jobs, crime, education and our open border, while the Biden White House is laser-focused on climate change, transgender rights, racism and reducing inequality. \n\n**[LIZ PEEK: BIDEN TEAM OFF TO UN CLIMATE SUMMIT AS THEIR GREEN ENERGY POLICIES FUEL INFLATION AT HOME](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-team-climate-summit-un-green-inflation-liz-peek)**\n\nIn a recent CBS/YouGov poll, only 37% of respondents said Biden and Democrats are focused on issues they \"care a lot about.\" That’s not good. \n\nJoe Biden is not walking down this misguided path alone; he is hauling nearly every agency of his government right along with him.  \n\n**[CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER](https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters)**\n\nFor instance, the FBI, instead of focusing on the surging murder rate in our nation, has been ordered to hunt down \"domestic terrorists\" among the parents rightfully objecting to the racist curriculums being taught to their children.  \n\nThe State Department, having abandoned hundreds of Americans in Afghanistan and grievously misplaying every encounter to date with China, recently took time out to celebrate \"International Pronouns Day,\" issuing an explainer about \"Pronoun Proficiency.\"   \n\n## More from Opinion\n\n* [Will Swaim: Garland's attempts to silence parents nothing new for Californians](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/garland-silence-parents-california-will-swaim)\n* [Lauren Appell: McAuliffe looks desperate in Virginia, pushes the panic button in tight race](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/mcauliffe-desperate-virginia-panic-button-race-lauren-appell)\n* [Rebekah Koffler: Biden nominee prefers Soviet system to free-market economy – don't let them destroy the US](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-nominee-saule-omarova-soviet-central-planning-rebekh-koffler)\n\nThe Treasury Department, which completely missed the boat on skyrocketing inflation, in March undertook a \"formal racial equity review of the agency and its programs,\" according to the New York Times, which reported that Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen \"is making racial equity a centerpiece of her agenda…\" \n\nMaybe that’s important, but probably not as important to most people as bacon prices soaring 19% over the past year, or the 42% hike in the cost of gasoline or the rapid rise in rents. \n\nBut even as gender and racial issues are a priority for the Biden team, it is climate change that truly preoccupies this White House.  \n\nThe Biden administration just released several reports about climate change and its impact on national security. One of those, according to the New York Times, includes a warning that – this is not a joke – that \"countries like Iraq and Algeria could be hit by lost revenue from fossil fuels, even as their regions face worsening heat and drought.\" \n\n> The unhappy fact is that Joe Biden has slipped not only in overall approval, but in ways that will be hard to repair. \n\nGot it? If climate activists succeed in weaning consumers off oil and gas, the world could become less safe. Hint: then don’t do it.   \n\nWhile tilting for windmills, our intel groups have missed some pretty big events. In August, China launched a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile. The Financial Times, which broke the story, reported that the advanced rocket took \"U.S. intelligence by surprise.\" One source was quoted saying, \"We have no idea how they did this.\" The FT noted that \"The test has raised new questions about why the US often underestimated China’s military modernisation.\" \n\nThis is alarming. In fiscal 2020 the United States spent $86 billion on intelligence, more than the entire GDP of Guatemala. That is a lot of money, much of which, one presumes, is spent gleaning information about our biggest rivals. \n\n[Video](http://video.foxnews.com/v/6276108818001)\n\nThat would include China which, unlike North Korea, is open to travelers and, presumably, intelligence sources. How is it possible we knew nothing about a weapons/space program that must have been underway for several years?   \n\nThe Defense Department, bruised by the disgraceful and disastrous pullout from Afghanistan, also issued a climate report, warning that food shortages brought on by global warming might increase conflicts around the world.  \n\nAccording to the 2020 Food and Agriculture Organization of the U.N., between 2000 and 2018 (latest available), global primary crop production increased by 50%, vegetable oil production more than doubled and meat output rose 47%. During the same period, the world’s population expanded by 24%. \n\nTragically, there is and always has been hunger in the world. But the root of the problem is not climate change, but poverty in regions like Africa, brought on by corruption, inadequate development and so much more. \n\n[Video](http://video.foxnews.com/v/6274603134001)\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security added its two cents on climate, reporting that ice melting in the Arctic would increase competition for fish and minerals in the region. Yes, as Artic ice melts, the fish and resources in the area would become accessible, for the first time. That might actually seem a good thing, especially if you were worried about food shortages. \n\nThat is the same Homeland Security that is incapable of stopping the flow of people illegally entering the country, reporting that a record 1.7 million people were detained at our border in the last fiscal year.  \n\nThis is not to suggest we should ignore the warming of the planet, or gender issues or racial divides. But as the Biden White House diverts the energies and resources of the federal government toward solving issues not top-of-mind for most voters, they must be prepared for the fallout. \n\n**[CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP](https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products)**\n\nThe unhappy fact is that Joe Biden has slipped not only in overall approval, but in ways that will be hard to repair.

It’s tallying at least $1.75 trillion, and could still be more. Biden said it would be “very, very positive to get it done” before he departs for two overseas global summits.\n\n“That’s my hope,” the president said before leaving his home state of Delaware for a trip to New Jersey to highlight the child care proposals in the package and a related infrastructure measure. “With the grace of God and the goodwill of the neighbors.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n### JOE BIDEN\n\n#### Billionaire tax hits critics as Biden pushes for budget deal\n\n#### Majority in US concerned about climate: AP-NORC/EPIC poll\n\n#### White House eyes new climate change strategies in Biden bill\n\n#### EXPLAINER: What's a 'wealth tax' and how would it work?\n\nResolving [the revenue side](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-joe-biden-business-health-personal-taxes-bb51ab8b987c32e00c743a05d428079c) is key as the Democrats scale back what had been a $3.5 trillion plan, insisting all the new spending will be fully paid for and not pile onto the debt. Biden vows any new taxes would hit only the wealthy, those earning more than $400,000 a year, or $450,000 for couples.\n\nThe White House had to rethink its tax strategy after one key Democrat, [Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz.](https://apnews.com/hub/kyrsten-sinema), objected to her party’s [initial proposal to raise tax rates](https://apnews.com/article/technology-joe-biden-business-personal-taxes-137e00b41f113f85cc241438c780785b) on wealthy Americans by undoing the Trump-era tax cuts on those earning beyond $400,000. Sinema also opposed lifting the 21% corporate tax rate. With a 50-50 Senate, Biden has no votes to spare in his party.\n\nInstead, to win over Sinema and others, the White House has been floating a new idea of [taxing the assets of billionaires](https://apnews.com/article/climate-joe-biden-business-kyrsten-sinema-scranton-e14e20533772419bc1e390ff69ff5395) and another that would require corporations to pay a 15% minimum tax, regardless of if they show any profits. Those both appear to be gaining traction with another [pivotal Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., ](https://apnews.com/hub/joe-manchin)who told reporters he supported new ways to ensure the wealthy to pay their “fair share.”\n\nDemocrats on the Senate Finance Committee, led by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, are prepared to roll out the tax revenue plan in a matter of days. It is likely to include other revenue-raising tax measures, including a plan to beef up the IRS to go after tax scofflaws.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“Here’s the heart of it: Americans read over the last few months that billionaires were paying little or no taxes for years on end,” Wyden said at the Capitol.\n\nThe billionaires’ tax is being modeled on a 2019 bill from Wyden to treat assets as income. Another idea, up to a 3% ultra-rich surtax, has been proposed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\n\nUnder Wyden’s emerging plan, the billionaires’ tax would hit the wealthiest of Americans, fewer than 1,000 people. It would require those with assets of more than $1 billion, or three-years consecutive income of $100 million, to pay taxes on the gains of stocks and other tradeable assets, rather than waiting until holdings are sold.\n\nA similar billionaire’s tax would be applied to non-tradeable assets, including real estate, but it would be deferred with the tax not assessed until the asset was sold.\n\nOverall, the billionaires’ tax rate has not been set, but it is expected to be at least the 20% capital gains rate. Democrats have said it could raise $200 billion in revenue that could help fund Biden’s package over 10 years.\n\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell called it a “hare-brained scheme” and warned of revenue drying up during downturns. Some Republicans indicated such a tax plan could be challenged in court.\n\nBut key fellow Democrats are also raising concerns, saying the idea of simply undoing the 2017 tax cuts by hiking top rates was more straightforward and transparent.\n\nUnder the [House’s bill ](https://apnews.com/article/technology-joe-biden-business-personal-taxes-137e00b41f113f85cc241438c780785b)from the Ways and Means Committee, the top individual income tax rate would rise from 37% to 39.6%, on those earning more than $400,000, or $450,000 for couples. The corporate rate would increase from 21% to 26.5%. The bill also proposed a 3% surtax on wealthier Americans with adjusted income beyond $5 million a year.\n\nThe panel’s chairman, Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., said he told Wyden in a discussion Monday that the implementation of the senator’s proposed billionaire’s plan is “a bit more challenging.”\n\nNeal suggested that the House’s proposal was off the table despite Sinema’s objections. In fact, he said, “our plan looks better every day.”\n\nOnce Democrats agree to the tax proposals, they can assess how much is funding available for Biden’s overall package to expand health care, child care and other climate change programs.\n\nDemocrats were hoping Biden could cite major accomplishments to world leaders later this week. They are also facing an Oct. 31 deadline to pass a related $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package of roads, broadband and other public works before routine federal transportation funds expire.\n\n“We need to get this done,” Biden said in remarks at a New Jersey transit center.\n\nAfter months of start-and-stop negotiations, Biden’s overall package is now being eyed as at least $1.75 trillion. But it could still climb considerably higher, according to a second person who insisted on anonymity to discuss the private talks.\n\nBiden huddled with the conservative West Virginia Democrat Manchin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer at the president’s Delaware home on Sunday as they work on resolving the disputes between centrists and progressives that have stalled the bill.\n\nDisputes remain over far-reaching investments, including plans to expand Medicare coverage with dental, vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors; child care assistance; free pre-kindergarten; and a new program of four-weeks paid family leave.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said expected an agreement by week’s end, paving the way for a House vote on the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill. The Senate had approved that over the summer, but the measure stalled during deliberations on the broader Biden bill.\n\nBut Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus whose support will be crucial for both bills, said lawmakers want more than just a framework for Biden’s plan before they give their votes for the smaller infrastructure package.\n\n“We want the whole bill,” Jayapal told The Associated Press. “We want to vote on both bills at the same time.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Farnoush Amiri, Hope Yen and Colleen Long contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show Rep. Richard Neal is from Massachusetts, not New Jersey.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrending on AP News\n\n[EXPLAINER: What’s a ‘wealth tax’ and how would it work?](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-joe-biden-business-health-personal-taxes-bb51ab8b987c32e00c743a05d428079c)\n\n[Florida’s top doctor refuses mask, is told to leave meeting](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-florida-b79b9e4308b9ce0b4335cdfa69436b1b)\n\n[Biden ‘positive’ on budget deal; Manchin OK with wealth tax](https://apnews.com/article/joe-manchin-joe-biden-nancy-pelosi-wealth-tax-congress-132c737a5a2fb5ea1931df2344f55567)\n\n[by Taboola](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=associatedpress-apnews&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=organic-thumbnails-rr:Right%20Rail%20Thumbnails:)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTop Articlesby *The Associated Press*[The judge leading Beirut blast probe:Discreet and defiant](https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-religion-explosions-lebanon-beirut-2c813a38a3ab2789f07fa48799aac82a?traffic_source=Connatix)\n\n[EXPLAINER: What’s a ‘wealth tax’ and how would it work?To help pay for his big economic and social agenda, President Joe Biden is looking to go where the big money is: billionaires.

{"id": "65ww_Pv5OhPTsC0KZTJntB4VohvyuGalGv4isc8gfUs", "title": "Xi's not there? COP26 hopes dim on Chinese leader's likely absence", "body": "SHANGHAI, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The leaders of most of the world's biggest [greenhouse gas emitters](https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/world-scrambles-contain-damage-greenhouse-gas-emissions-hit-record-2021-10-25/) gather in Glasgow from Sunday, aiming to thrash out plans and funds to tilt the planet towards clean energy. But the man running the biggest of them all likely won't be there.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping's expected absence from the talks could indicate that the world's biggest CO2 producer has already decided that it has no more concessions to offer at the U.N. COP26 climate summit in Scotland after three [major pledges](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/its-down-world-leaders-honour-climate-pledges-says-uk-cop26-chief-2021-10-11) since last year, climate watchers said.\n\nInstead, China will likely be represented by vice-environment minister Zhao Yingmin along with the veteran Xie Zhenhua, who was reappointed as the country's top climate envoy earlier this year following a three-year hiatus.\n\n\"One thing is clear,\" said Li Shuo, senior climate adviser with Greenpeace in Beijing. \"COP26 needs [high-level support](https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/uks-johnson-says-touch-go-whether-cop26-secures-agreements-needed-2021-10-25) from China as well as other emitters.\"\n\nThe head of the world's third-biggest source of climate-warming emissions, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has [committed to attending](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/exclusive-indian-pm-modi-will-attend-glasgow-climate-conference-minister-2021-10-21) the COP26 summit, which runs from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12. Like other leaders, he will come under pressure from summit organisers to commit to quicker emissions cuts and set a target date to reach carbon neutrality - a target set by Xi for 2060 in a surprise move last year.\n\nBut China will be unwilling to be seen yielding to international pressure for more ambitious goals, according to one environmental consultant, especially as it grapples with [a crippling energy supply crunch](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-behind-chinas-power-crunch-2021-09-29) at home. Beijing is \"already maxed out\", said the consultant, speaking on condition of anonymity citing the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThough there has been no official announcement, analysts and diplomatic sources said few had been expecting Xi to attend COP26 in person. He has already missed several high-profile global summits since the COVID-19 outbreak began in late 2019, and didn't physically attend the Global Biodiversity Conference in China's Kunming earlier this month.\n\nThey also said Xi was unlikely to lend his physical presence - a virtual video appearance remains a possibility - to a meeting that had little prospect of any significant breakthrough, especially after China brushed off U.S. attempts to treat climate as a 'standalone' issue that could be separated from the broader diplomatic disputes between the two sides.\n\nRather than making more concessions, China and India's top priority is to secure a strong financing deal allowing richer countries to meet their Paris Agreement commitment to provide $100 billion per year to help pay for climate adaptation and transfer clean technology in the developing world. Xi did attend the Paris summit in person in 2015.\n\nDOMESTIC CONCERNS\n\nAlthough Xi has not travelled outside China since before the pandemic, he has made three major climate announcements on the international stage.\n\nHis unexpected net zero commitment came in a video address to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in September 2020. That announcement encouraged enterprises, industry sectors and even other countries to respond with their own net-zero action plans.\n\nXi also said in a message to the U.S.-led Leaders Summit on Climate in April that China would start cutting coal consumption by 2026. And he used this year's UNGA to announce [an immediate end to overseas coal financing](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chinas-overseas-coal-power-retreat-could-wipe-out-50-bln-investment-2021-09-22), a major bone of contention.\n\nLike India, China has been under pressure to add more ambition to its updated \"nationally determined contributions\" (NDCs) on climate change, which are due to be announced before the Glasgow talks begin.\n\nHowever, the revisions are expected to focus on implementing the targets that have already been announced, rather than making them more ambitious.\n\nChina has repeatedly stressed that its climate policies are designed to serve its own domestic priorities, and will not be pursued at the expense of national security and public welfare.\n\nMa Jun, director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a Beijing-based non-government group that monitors corporate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, said China already had enough climate challenges to deal with and has little leeway to go further in Glasgow.\n\n\"With all the headwinds and all the pledges that have been made, it is important to take stock and consolidate,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not enough to put these (commitments) on paper,\" he added. \"We have to translate them into solid actions.\"\n\nReporting by David Stanway; Additional reporting by Neha Arora in New Delhi; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)", "timestamp": 1635248025, "digest": "_vnEKYB-LHQc-uZywquh1CZMTF0UbEfbjvamGK2S3ek", "contributor": "0x901C4828494a1780e0ACF1A285d1C48558758FD3"}

But agreement on key issues has not yet been finalized, including the overall cost of the package, how it will be paid for and how to deal with policy items like a proposed Medicare expansion that progressives want to see included.\n\nOn the overall price tag, Manchin said [that he is \"still\" at $1.5 trillion](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/30/politics/manchin-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-vote-negotiations/index.html) for a topline, a number that top Democrats have been hoping to push higher given that progressives had called for a $3.5 trillion price tag.\n\nManchin also expressed concerns over insolvency when asked by CNN whether he is open to expanding Medicare.\n\n\"Medicare and Social Security is a lifeline for people back in West Virginia, most people around the country, and you've got to stabilize that first before you look at basically expansion,\" he said. \"So, if we're not being fiscally responsible, that's really concerning.\"\n\nAsked specifically about whether he is concerned that adding dental, vision and hearing could make Medicare insolvent, Manchin said, \"Right now it's not fiscally responsible, I don't think. I've always tried to be fiscally responsible and for me to tell you 'I'm going to give you something,' where by 2026 you could be paying more premiums because what we have right now is in dire need. So I want to make sure we shore up everything.\"\n\n[Biden pitches spending plans in New Jersey ahead of key week for Hill negotiations](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/25/politics/biden-new-jersey-negotiations/index.html)\n\nAsked if he is concerned about paid leave in the package, Manchin said, \"I'm concerned about an awful lot of things.\" Asked if paid leave will be part of a framework deal, he said, \"I'm not going to talk about what's in and what's out right now because there's an awful lot of moving parts, but there's a lot of concerns that we have a lot of different things.\"\n\nManchin did suggest, though, that he is open to [a tax on billionaires](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2021/10/24/yellen-on-billionaire-tax.cnn) and a corporate minimum tax as potential pay-for mechanisms for the plan.\n\nAsked if he supports a wealth tax, Manchin did not shut down the idea, saying, \"I support basically everyone paying their fair share of taxes. How you get to it, we all have a different approach to that, but as far as on taxation, I think that corporations should be paying at least a minimum if they're doing business in the United States.\"\n\nManchin broadly outlined his overall philosophy as he plays a key role in the negotiations and is frequently at odds with progressives in his party. \"I've always said that I believe that government should ... be your best partner, but it shouldn't be your provider,\" he said.\n\n### Talks ongoing to reach a deal\n\nSenate Democrats continued to meet Monday night in an effort to work through remaining sticking points.\n\nManchin huddled with top Democrats to talk about climate provisions in the bill, and Democrats emerged saying they still didn't have a deal yet on an issue that Manchin has fought them on.\n\nHe's also faced pressure to back off his opposition to four weeks of paid leave policies that Democrats want to include in the bill. Manchin has raised concerns that the policies could hurt businesses, Democratic sources say.\n\nNew York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said she is in negotiations with Manchin over family leave policies.\n\n\"I'm hoping to work with him on an employer-employee matching plan. That's something he's very interested in and I'm going to try to work with him on a plan that meets his area of interest,\" she told reporters as she was leaving the Capitol.\n\nShe said the proposal would not remove the government's role in the program but declined to say more except that she's working to find something with which Manchin would be \"comfortable.\"\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia said he called Manchin to urge him to support closing the Medicaid coverage gap — something of prime importance to both Ossoff and fellow Georgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock.\n\n\"I'm fighting for it, 275,000 Georgians in the gap. We've got to close the coverage gap. Spoke with Manchin about it today. Raphael and I are in hourly touch about it ... Negotiations are ongoing.\"\n\nLeaving the Capitol, Manchin said little about where the talks were headed. And he wouldn't talk about his opposition to paid family leave — and if that is a red line for him.\n\nEmerging from a meeting between Senate Committee chairs and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democratic Sens. Gary Peters of Michigan and Maria Cantwell of Washington said they are still negotiating how to meet their goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions after Manchin opposed a clean electricity standard that would cut them by 50% over the next decade.\n\nPressed by CNN as to whether the total amount spent on climate would be around the $300 billion mark that has been floated recently, Peters said that he believed so.\n\n\"Everybody had their piece and I think that's probably in the ballpark,\" he said. Cantwell echoed that, noting, \"On the tax credit side, I think that's right.\"\n\nOn alternatives to the clean energy program, Peters laid out a few of the options they are considering. \"We've talked about other areas related to climate and various aspects of the bill, so in my mind, you know, it's procurement for electric vehicles, hydrogen vehicles, zero emission vehicles, it's clean procurement for building materials from what the government is purchasing, resiliency,\" he said.\n\n* \n\nBoth praised Manchin for his continued work on the plan, despite his opposition to a central piece of the climate provisions. Peters noted that \"he was very open to the discussion. We had a very, it was a very fruitful discussion,\" while Cantwell added, \"I think the fact that he was here and was doing all this shows that yeah, people are marching.\"", "timestamp": 1635247920, "digest": "Gif2xAio-MOTLCrvqm5fAx2grFdwdsu3XH_9t2vz17o", "contributor": "0x08E4AfddFE6e26C3CC56118D50d4E267490898aE"}

Two days later, on September 15, officials thought they saw him return to the family home in the same car.\n\nAs pressure mounted in [the search for Petito](https://www.insider.com/live-updates-gabby-petito-disappearance-2021-9), North Port Police Chief Todd Garrison told reporters on Thursday, September 16 that police were confident Brian was inside his home.\n\n\"All I'm going to say is I know where Brian Laundrie is at,\" Garrison said during a press conference. \n\nBut the very next day, [Laundrie's parents reported him missing](https://www.businessinsider.in/international/news/brian-laundrie-boyfriend-of-missing-22-year-old-gabby-petito-has-also-gone-missing-attorney-for-the-family-says/articleshow/86310429.cms?_ga=2.68483990.625588183.1635187349-1077128706.1610375838), telling officers they had not seem him since Tuesday, September 14, when he told them he was going for a hike in Sarasota County's Carlton Reserve, carrying only a backpack.

So who does that? Right? Like, if you think your son's missing since Tuesday, you're going to bring his car back to the home.

That’s an astounding feat for October, which typically isn’t a very wet month. Similarly, San Jose received 50% as much rain over the weekend as it did during the entire previous year. In the East Bay, a foot fell during the week at Tilden Park in Berkeley and Mount Diablo’s summit. And Marin County, the bulls-eye of this weekend’s powerful atmospheric river, ended up with a breathtaking 26 inches over Mount Tamalpais when all was said and done.\n\nDoes the deluge mean California’s severe drought is over? No, experts said Monday as sunny skies returned.\n\nBut it was an excellent start to this year’s winter rainy season, they noted, sending tens of billions of gallons into anemically low reservoirs, all but ending fire season across much of the state and beginning the long task of recharging rivers and groundwater.\n\n“This was a frog-choker, but not a drought buster,” said Jeffrey Mount, a professor emeritus of earth and planetary sciences at UC Davis. “We’re still in a drought. But this storm sanded off some of its rough edges.”\n\nCalifornia needs another five to seven big atmospheric river storms to fill its reservoirs and end the drought, he estimated.\n\nThe forecast for Northern California calls for generally dry weather this week. Water managers and meteorologists are hoping for a repeat storm in November to keep up the momentum, given that the past two years have been the two driest in Northern California since 1976-77.\n\n“You just don’t make up for that in a single storm — even if it’s an all-time record,” said Mount, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California’s Water Policy Center.\n\nThis storm brought San Francisco’s monthly rainfall total for October to 7.04 inches, its second-wettest October since 1849 when its modern weather records began, behind only October 1889, when 7.28 inches fell.\n\n[美女まみれになれるというオンラインカジノはここですか？](https://eb2.3lift.com/pass?tl_clickthrough=true&redir=https%3A%2F%2Fad.doubleclick.net%2Fddm%2Ftrackclk%2FN837312.279382INVITEMEDIAINC.DO1%2FB24774011.284964983%3Bdc_trk_aid%3D478951260%3Bdc_trk_cid%3D139435443%3Bdc_lat%3D%3Bdc_rdid%3D%3Btag_for_child_directed_treatment%3D%3Btfua%3D%3Bgdpr%3D%24%7BGDPR%7D%3Bgdpr_consent%3D%24%7BGDPR_CONSENT_755%7D&ss=7&bc=3.889&pr=1.828&brid=117828&bmid=3690&clid=5780437&biid=3690&tid=6178868&sid=85217&aid=58250148105784477180&did=17561&bcud=3889&ts=1635249229&cb=43388)\n\n[クール系美女からかわいい系女子までよりどりみどり。美女ディーラーと遊べる大人の空間はココ！バカラ、ブラックジャック、ルーレット他、遊べるゲームも各種豊富。今すぐ登録して最大500ドルの期間限定ボーナスをゲットしよう！](https://eb2.3lift.com/pass?tl_clickthrough=true&redir=https%3A%2F%2Fad.doubleclick.net%2Fddm%2Ftrackclk%2FN837312.279382INVITEMEDIAINC.DO1%2FB24774011.284964983%3Bdc_trk_aid%3D478951260%3Bdc_trk_cid%3D139435443%3Bdc_lat%3D%3Bdc_rdid%3D%3Btag_for_child_directed_treatment%3D%3Btfua%3D%3Bgdpr%3D%24%7BGDPR%7D%3Bgdpr_consent%3D%24%7BGDPR_CONSENT_755%7D&ss=7&bc=3.889&pr=1.828&brid=117828&bmid=3690&clid=5780437&biid=3690&tid=6178868&sid=85217&aid=58250148105784477180&did=17561&bcud=3889&ts=1635249229&cb=43388)\n\n[SPONSORED BY ベラジョンカジノ](https://eb2.3lift.com/pass?tl_clickthrough=true&redir=https%3A%2F%2Fad.doubleclick.net%2Fddm%2Ftrackclk%2FN837312.279382INVITEMEDIAINC.DO1%2FB24774011.284964983%3Bdc_trk_aid%3D478951260%3Bdc_trk_cid%3D139435443%3Bdc_lat%3D%3Bdc_rdid%3D%3Btag_for_child_directed_treatment%3D%3Btfua%3D%3Bgdpr%3D%24%7BGDPR%7D%3Bgdpr_consent%3D%24%7BGDPR_CONSENT_755%7D&ss=7&bc=3.889&pr=1.828&brid=117828&bmid=3690&clid=5780437&biid=3690&tid=6178868&sid=85217&aid=58250148105784477180&did=17561&bcud=3889&ts=1635249229&cb=43388)\n\n[See more](https://eb2.3lift.com/pass?tl_clickthrough=true&redir=https%3A%2F%2Fad.doubleclick.net%2Fddm%2Ftrackclk%2FN837312.279382INVITEMEDIAINC.DO1%2FB24774011.284964983%3Bdc_trk_aid%3D478951260%3Bdc_trk_cid%3D139435443%3Bdc_lat%3D%3Bdc_rdid%3D%3Btag_for_child_directed_treatment%3D%3Btfua%3D%3Bgdpr%3D%24%7BGDPR%7D%3Bgdpr_consent%3D%24%7BGDPR_CONSENT_755%7D&ss=7&bc=3.889&pr=1.828&brid=117828&bmid=3690&clid=5780437&biid=3690&tid=6178868&sid=85217&aid=58250148105784477180&did=17561&bcud=3889&ts=1635249229&cb=43388)\n\n“It’s more than a drop in the bucket,” said Jan Null, a meteorologist with Golden Gate Weather Services in Half Moon Bay. “But it doesn’t fill the bucket.”\n\nWhy? Here’s the math: San Francisco received just 20.67 inches of rain over the past two years ending June 30, Null noted.\n\nSan Francisco is commonly used as an indicator for the Bay Area’s weather trends because it has the oldest set of accurate weather records.\n\nThe historical average for a two-year period there is 45.78 inches. So the city began this winter season down 25.11 inches — in other words, missing a full year of rain. To recoup that deficit, the city would need a staggering 48 inches of rain by next June.\n\nThat’s only happened once in recorded history, in the winter of 1861-62 when newly elected Gov. Leland Stanford rode a row boat through the streets of Sacramento to get to his inauguration and 49 inches fell. The Bay Area came close in 1997-98, when El Niño storms delivered 47 inches to San Francisco and caused widespread flooding across Northern California.\n\nMILLBRAE, CALIFORNIA – October 25: Flooding on Millbrae Avenue near Highway 101 in Millbrae, Calif., disrupts traffic on Monday, Oct. 25, 2021. An “atmospheric river” storm, the strongest to hit the Bay Area in two years moved through the Bay Area on Sunday. (Mercury News) \n\nImpacts from the past week’s storms continued Monday.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a high surf warning through Tuesday from Point Reyes National Seashore to Big Sur. Forecasters warned of 20 to 30 foot waves breaking at the beach and life-threatening rip currents.\n\nWater managers carefully checked reservoirs Monday and generally liked what they saw.\n\nAt Lake Oroville, California’s second-largest reservoir, in Butte County, the lake level rose 23 feet and added 135,000 acre-feet of water from last Monday to Monday afternoon — enough water for 675,000 people’s annual needs.

Marin County’s parched reservoirs, did better, increasing from 32% to 43% full.\n\nIn the Santa Cruz Mountains, Loch Lomond Reservoir near Ben Lomond, which received 9 inches of rain over the week, went up 1 foot, taking it from 53% to 54% full.\n\nWater managers said much of the water soaked into the dry ground, but they expect reservoir levels to slowly go up this week as surging streams flow downhill.\n\nIn the Sierra Nevada, some areas received more than three feet of snow on Sunday into Monday morning.\n\n## RELATED ARTICLES\n\n* [Storm totals: Who got the most rainfall in the Bay Area](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/10/25/storm-totals-who-got-the-most-rain-around-the-bay-area/)\n* [One rescued from Guadalupe River during Bay Area storm](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/10/25/san-jose-one-rescued-from-guadalupe-river-during-bay-area-storm/)\n* [Watch: Bay Area storm topples semi-truck, makes porta-potties dance](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/10/25/watch-storm-topples-over-semi-truck-makes-porta-potties-dance/)\n* [Bay Area storm: Crews clear flooded highways, fallen trees, while tens of thousands wait for power](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/10/25/bay-area-pummeled-by-heavy-rain-and-winds-showers-to-continue-into-monday/)\n* [Photos: Atmospheric river continues to pummel the Bay Area](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/10/24/photos-atmospheric-river-continues-to-pummel-the-bay-area/)\n\n“It’s pretty crazy,” said Chris Beam, a cook at Donner Ski Ranch, 10 miles northwest of Lake Tahoe. “I haven’t seen snow like this since March.

Would it allow a free and fair election later this year? Could Washington send an emissary to talk? Blinken nudged his counterpart in an encounter that lasted roughly 10 minutes, a senior State Department official said. But the foreign minister was non-committal, at best, when he wasn’t sticking to meaningless talking points.\n\nBlinken’s diplomatic foray didn’t turn out the way he’d hoped. In fact, the United States’ relationship with Nicaragua almost immediately turned much, much worse.\n\nDuring the next two months, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega dramatically escalated a crackdown on people he and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, deemed a threat to their continued rule of 14 years and counting. By mid-August, Ortega and Murillo had detained at least seven potential presidential rivals and barred the genuine opposition parties from participating in the Nov. 7 presidential election — [effectively wiping away any real competition](https://www.state.gov/the-lack-of-prospects-for-free-and-fair-election-in-nicaragua/). They’ve also detained or otherwise threatened dozens more human rights activists, business leaders, students, journalists and others in the Central American country of 6.5 million.\n\nThe repression is among the most intense a Western Hemisphere country has experienced in decades. Ortega and Murillo have a long and bloody history in Nicaraguan politics — one dotted with references to witchcraft, imperialism, erotica and Ronald Reagan. But now, U.S. officials and prominent Nicaraguans say, they appear to be taking things to a new level, imposing a police state with the goal of bringing about dynastic rule to the country.\n\nThe pair are defying Washington’s warnings, sanctions and visa bans, ignoring the objections of other neighboring states, and aligning themselves more with Moscow as they peddle what one U.S. official described as a religiously infused “magical realism” to Nicaraguan citizens. The two have even drawn an outcry from Hollywood by detaining the father of the creator of the hit TV show “Riverdale.”\n\nThe turmoil in Nicaragua has been overshadowed by events in nearby Venezuela, Haiti and Cuba, not to mention other parts of the world. But the tiny country in its own way has come to epitomize two of the key challenges that President Joe Biden says the world’s democracies cannot ignore: the rise of authoritarianism and the spread of corruption. If November’s election goes the way Ortega and Murillo have scripted it, it could also deepen the hemisphere’s migration crisis.\n\n[IMMIGRATION](https://www.politico.com/news/immigration)\n\n## It’s not just Republicans. Everyone’s mad at Biden over migration.\n\nBY [SABRINA RODRIGUEZ](https://www.politico.com/staff/sabrina-rodriguez)\n\nBiden aides say they are working with regional partners and cranking up the pressure on the regime in Managua. But U.S. lawmakers from both parties, as well as other voices, say the Biden administration must do more, quickly, to reverse the trend in Nicaragua.\n\n“It’s basically become a dictatorship because of the jailing of political opposition and stomping out of any political other side,” said Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas). “There has to be a strong message to the Nicaraguan government that the United States and the region soundly reject that dictatorial situation.”\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) added in a statement: “The Biden administration must hold this undemocratic regime — which continues to censor the press and imprison its political opponents — accountable for its crimes.”\n\n### ‘Very grave and very disturbing’\n\nThe speed and scope of this summer’s Nicaraguan crackdown has startled even veteran observers of Latin America. But the country’s democracy has been eroding for quite some time, thanks largely to the machinations of Ortega and Murillo.\n\nBoth once fought autocracy in their country. As members of the Sandinista rebel movement, they helped topple the dynastic dictatorship of Nicaragua’s Somoza family. Ortega served as president during the second half of the 1980s, butting heads through that decade with Reagan, who loathed the Sandinistas’ pro-communist views and deputized the CIA to undermine Ortega’s rule by arming rebels known as the Contras.\n\nOrtega was voted out in 1990, just as the Cold War was drawing to an end and his patrons in the Soviet Union were watching their empire crumble. But he kept trying to regain the presidency, eventually winning in 2006. He’s held on to the office ever since through [increasingly questionable maneuvers](https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/peace/americas/nicaragua_2011_report_post.pdf), including changes to the constitution. Ortega and his wife’s regime, in [the words of one U.S. official](https://usoas.usmission.gov/oas-resolution-condemns-ortega-regime-in-nicaragua/), “controls all centers of power in Nicaragua including the Executive, the Legislature, the Judiciary, and the Supreme Electoral Council.”\n\nOrtega and Murillo have come a long way from the Sandinistas’ socialist ideals. They have embraced elements of capitalism and benefited richly from it. The family is believed to control significant chunks of the country’s economy, including in the media and energy sectors. And they’re not afraid to use violence to protect their hold on power. In 2018, Ortega used official security forces as well as pro-government paramilitary groups to crush massive anti-governments protests; at least 300 people died and more than 100,000 Nicaraguans have fled the country since that crackdown.\n\nOrtega’s wife is, by most accounts, highly influential and in charge of many day-to-day decisions. He’s something of a recluse who, nonetheless, still enjoys railing against American imperialism. She is the more colorful public face of their regime, and her interests over the years have [reportedly included witchcraft](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1990-01-30-9001210869-story.html) and[ erotic poetry](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nicaragua-wife/nicaraguans-see-first-lady-as-power-behind-throne-idUKN2632184220070129). Murillo delivers near-daily remarks to the country via multiple media platforms, and she has literally changed the landscape through public art and other projects often bathed in soft colors like yellow and pink.\n\nMurillo already was a powerful first lady and the government spokesperson before Ortega [put her on the ballot](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/31/world/americas/nicaragua-daniel-ortega-rosario-murillo-house-of-cards.html) as his No. 2 in 2016. A senior Biden administration official declined to say which member of the power couple holds the real authority. The official stressed, however, that this summer’s crackdown on the opposition was a “very grave and very disturbing” development, and that it “fundamentally alters” how Nicaragua’s leadership should be viewed.\n\n## MOST READ\n\n1.

He responded by emailing a lengthy statement defending the Nicaraguan system while denouncing U.S. “aggressions” that “constitute crimes against humanity.”\n\n“The People of Nicaragua are not asking for permission to exercise their Right to National Sovereignty, Independence and Self-determination. That Right was conquered with blood, sweat and tears and with the memory of hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguan Sisters and Brothers,” the statement declared.\n\nBut as repression has intensified and it’s become clear that [November’s elections](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210925-nicaragua-s-presidential-campaign-kicks-off-with-no-rivals) won’t offer voters a real choice, the climate inside Nicaragua is akin to a “state of terror,” prominent Nicaraguan journalist Carlos Fernando Chamorro said.\n\nChamorro is the director of the [news organization Confidencial](https://www.confidencial.com.ni/) and he himself faces criminal charges from the regime. His sister, Cristiana Chamorro, is one of the targeted potential presidential candidates and is under house arrest. Their brother Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, a politician and activist, has been imprisoned.\n\nCarlos Fernando Chamorro, who is in exile in Costa Rica, said that on the surface in Nicaragua, it appears that “life goes on,” but that’s just a façade. “People have their so-called normal lives under this police state, under a state of repression,” he said in a phone interview. “People cannot express themselves.”\n\nA second senior Biden administration official described the situation as feeling “like the walls are closing in and space is being closed off.” The official added, “I get the sense that a lot of Nicaraguans have sort of lost hope for the medium term.”\n\n### ‘They have their own lawyers’\n\nAlmost from the start of Biden’s tenure, his administration has denounced or otherwise made moves against Nicaragua. On Feb. 8, State Department spokesperson [Ned Price warned](https://www.state.gov/nicaraguas-foreign-agents-law-drives-nicaragua-toward-dictatorship-silencing-independent-voices/) that “Ortega is driving Nicaragua toward dictatorship” as the Nicaraguan leader shut down civil society groups under a law targeting “foreign agents.”\n\nA week after Blinken’s effort at diplomacy in Costa Rica, the Biden administration announced it was [levying economic sanctions on several Nicaraguans](https://www.state.gov/announcing-sanctions-on-the-ortega-regime-in-response-to-arbitrary-detentions-and-other-undemocratic-moves/), including one of Ortega and Murillo’s children.

We are going to continue pressing ahead with that. We're going to utilize all these different tools that we have utilized on this,\" Dart said during a news conference at his office in Maywood.\n\n\"There is no end of when we should have compassion in law enforcement,\" Dart added. \"There should be no end. And we should continue until we can identify each and every missing person we have, whether they're a victim of John Gacy or a complete stranger or someone they knew.\"\n\nDart read a statement issued by Alexander's family after he spoke to them Monday morning, and after sheriff's police made formal notification to them on Friday.\n\nby signing up you agree to our [terms of service](https://www.dailyherald.com/info/terms-of-service/)\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\n \n\n\"It is hard, even 45 years later, to know the fate of our beloved Wayne,\" the family wrote. \"He was killed at the hands of a vile and evil man. Our hearts are heavy, and our sympathies go out to the other victims' families. Our only comfort is knowing this killer no longer breathes the same air as we do.\"\n\nAlexander is survived by a mother, two half-sisters and two half-brothers. They plan to come to Cook County in the spring, but haven't decided whether they will take his remains back to North Carolina, Dart said. Alexander was buried in 1981 at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Hillside by the Cook County medical examiner's office and local funeral directors.\n\nAuthorities said Monday Alexander arrived in Chicago with his wife in February 1975 shortly after getting married in New York, but they divorced after three months. Alexander worked at bars and clubs and lived on Winona Street in Chicago's Uptown neighborhood, an area where Gacy was known to target victims.\n\nInvestigators believe Gacy killed Alexander sometime before March 1977 because of where his body was positioned in the crawl space. Police combed through financial records, public records and other reports which revealed Alexander got a traffic ticket on Jan. 5, 1976, and earned little income in 1976.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\n \n\nThere never was a missing-person report filed on Alexander; shortly after his divorce, no one in his family heard from him again.\n\n\"There was never any thought that Gacy was somehow involved in the fact that Wayne was no longer around,\" Dart said. \"He had made decisions in his life that led them to believe that he just wanted to be left alone. ... They loved him, but they thought that he wanted nothing more to do with them.\"\n\nA decade ago, Dart renewed his agency's efforts to identify Gacy's unknown victims by using more modern DNA technology, and the remains of eight unidentified victims were exhumed to collect genetic material for testing.\n\nIn 2011, those advances led to the identification of 19-year-old William George Bundy of Chicago as one of Gacy's victims. Bundy lived blocks from Alexander, Dart said Monday.\n\nIn 2017, Dart's office identified James \"Jimmie\" Byron Haakenson of Minnesota as another Gacy victim.\n\nCairenn Binder, center, with the nonprofit organization called the DNA Doe Project, talks about the group's involvement in helping authorities identify \"Gacy Victim 5\" as North Carolina native Francis Wayne Alexander, during a news conference Monday, Oct. 25, 2021, in Maywood, Ill. Joining Fullam-Binder are Cook County Sheriff's Detective Lt. Jason Moran, left, and Sheriff Tom Dart. - Associated Press\n\nBut what makes the latest case different is the use of so-called genetic genealogy. The sheriff's office partnered with volunteers from the [DNA Doe Project](https://dnadoeproject.org/), a California-based nonprofit organization that compared Alexander's DNA profile -- using a molar and part of the jaw bone -- to DNA people have willingly submitted on the [GEDmatch](https://www.gedmatch.com/) genealogy website. That database turned up four potential relatives: a second cousin, fifth cousin, third cousin once removed and fifth cousin once removed.\n\n\"The family has well-documented lineages, so the process was fairly straightforward,\" said Cairenn Binder, the organization's co-team leader who worked on the project.\n\nSheriff's police took DNA samples from Alexander's mother and a half-brother to confirm the validity of the lead.\n\nPreviously, Dart said investigators were limited by only receiving DNA samples from those who suspected their relatives might have been Gacy victims. Now, the pool of possible connections has expanded.\n\n\"It's an area we had not been able to access before,\" Dart said. \"Technology keeps advancing and techniques and tools keep advancing.\"\n\nDart and lead investigator Lt. Jason Moran said they plan to use the new method, along with conventional investigative techniques, in other missing and unidentified persons cases. That includes trying to identify the five other unknown Gacy victims.\n\n\"This is our first case using genetic genealogy, so we wanted to make sure it was effective,\" Moran said. \"This is the new one and we decided to use it, and it was successful.\"\n\nGacy, who preyed on teenage boys and young men between 1970 and 1978, was arrested on Dec. 21, 1978 and executed in 1994.\n\nSince reopening the Gacy case in 2011, Dart's office has also solved four unrelated cold case deaths, located five missing persons alive, and identified two missing persons who had died without their families' knowledge.", "timestamp": 1635249461, "digest": "CSuf4pc00WHutrKWfUzZi6JLCnUh5NVua43LX-bl66o", "contributor": "0x3dD2445439d0e0b486114E6168109d8644d9C712"}

They also know that polarization results in more customer engagement that increases company profits at the expense of social safety, Haugen testified.\n\nZuckerberg has disputed that characterization of the company.\n\nIn testimony Monday before a U.K. Parliament committee, Haugen said Facebook [“lionizes growth” over all else](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-whistleblower-shocked-companys-investment-metaverse-rcna3725) and called for an overhaul of the company.\n\nShe advocated for greater transparency and said that an outside regulator should insist that Facebook provide solutions to a litany of harms.\n\n“Instead of investing in 10,000 engineers to make the metaverse, invest in 10,000 engineers to [make our world safer](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-whistleblower-shocked-companys-investment-metaverse-rcna3725),” she urged.", "timestamp": 1635250000, "digest": "kEsT1-VePeWBDtkMgRGWO1wO9TNWS0CxPTdFzLyriKw", "contributor": "0x445D2E92B9b68e0254f0d0F5FFDbbB8AD476AfbA"}

It’s a scenario that Apple store employees have trained for. \n \n\nRios says he and others were eventually let out of the Apple store through a back door and out to their vehicles.\n\nLike everyone else shopping at the mall, this was supposed to be a routine stop at the mall today.

But it's the first to put the one-inch sensor from the popular [Sony RX100 VII camera](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/compact-cameras/all-compact-cameras/p/dscrx100m7-b) into a phone. Lucky for us, Sony didn't stop there and added a mechanical dual-aperture, a new 50-millimeter lens, EyeAF support to video and a new app called Video Pro. The price for all of this is $1,800 which converts roughly to £1,300, AU$2,400.\n\nIf you are obsessed with finding the [best cameras](https://www.cnet.com/news/best-camera-gear-and-cameras-of-2020-canon-nikon-more/) on a phone, the past month has been a generous one. [Apple](https://www.cnet.com/apple/) released the [iPhone 13](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/iphone-13-review/) and [13 Pro](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/iphone-13-pro-max-review/). [Google](https://www.cnet.com/google/) launched [Pixel 6](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/google-pixel-6-review-yes-it-lives-up-to-the-hype/) and [6 Pro](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/google-pixel-6-pro-review-the-best-android-phone-money-can-buy/). And now there is the Sony Xperia Pro-I. The I stands for imaging.

In 2018, cinema camera maker [Red got our hopes up with the Hydrogen One phone](https://www.cnet.com/reviews/red-hydrogen-one-review/) which ended up having a mid-tier Android camera system that could shoot 3D photos and videos. \n\nNow don't get me wrong, what Apple, Google, [Huawei](https://www.cnet.com/tags/huawei/) and [Samsung](https://www.cnet.com/samsung/) have been able to do with tiny image sensors and computational photography is absolutely amazing. But you have to wonder: What if the iPhone, instead of having an image sensor that was 0.6 inches, had one that was one-inch? And that's where Sony enters the conversation with the Xperia Pro-I. It's basically a [Sony Xperia 1 III phone](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/sony-xperia-1-iii-review-it-could-have-been-magnificent-phone/) with the sensor from a Sony RX100 VII camera.\n\n![Sony Xperia Pro-I](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/yLNVSeDlp3pX6-FiGiuIM1FY8Sg=/1092x0/2021/10/26/87594683-249d-4722-ae34-33211b6e05de/p1018318-1.jpg?size=large pull-none hasCaption shortcode)\n\nWhat's amazing is that Sony was able to fit a one-inch sensor into a phone body that is roughly the same thickness as an [iPhone 13 Pro Max](https://www.cnet.com/videos/review-iphone-13-pro-and-13-pro-max-are-apples-best/). A larger sensor means a wider dynamic range and improved low-light performance for both photos and videos. But it turns out, that one-inch image sensor might not be fully used. The [camera review website DPReview points out](https://www.dpreview.com/news/1641689739/sony-just-packed-a-1-stacked-cmos-sensor-into-the-xperia-pro-i-but-there-s-a-catch) that just 60% of the Xperia Pro-I's one-inch sensor is used for photos and videos. That means instead of taking 20-megapixel photos like the Sony RX100 VII, the Xperia Pro-I takes 12-megapixel photos. That's not necessarily a dealbreaker, but it's a definite bummer.\n\nSony sent me a pre-production sample of the Xperia Pro-I to try. Photos and videos look good. Check out the hands-on video attached to this article to see video clips I shot using the Xperia Pro-I. I still have more testing and will do a full in-depth review once I can get a final production sample. All photos and videos I shot were taken with the main camera and its 24-millimeter lens or the ultrawide camera with its 16-millimeter lens. The 50-millimeter camera was disabled on the pre-production prototype.", "timestamp": 1635250157, "digest": "rY947q0ToVpCMu_bPPHpSxFH6Tth7FWpyt7fvXMwDgo", "contributor": "0xCfc76E86305228994324774C3Bdc98272a4700f3"}

Customers in New Zealand and Australia are always the first to get their hands on new devices due to time zone differences, and the new MacBook Pro models are no exception.\n\n14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are beginning to arrive to customers who pre-ordered last Monday, and new MacBook Pro owners have been sharing photos on the MacRumors forums.\n\nmacbook pro daisuke mr forums\n\nImage via MacRumors reader daisuke.5\n\nThere are no Apple Stores in New Zealand, so customers in Australia and countries across Asia are the first to be able to pick up a MacBook Pro at an Apple retail location.

Most people who want a custom configured machine will need to order online and wait, however.\nSupplies of stock MacBook Pro models are constrained and new orders won't arrive until mid-to-late November or early December in some cases, so getting a stock configuration in a store is now the only way to get one of the new machines on launch day.\n\nFollowing New Zealand, Australia, and Asia, sales of the MacBook Pro will begin in the Middle East, Europe, and then North America.

{"id": "Q8UW8EpL3SN2-RrS0ZRbxBXCUncKjnXRHQqChO-Bgko", "title": "Google Pixel 6 battery life tested — we have bad news", "body": "If you’re wondering if the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are worth buying, the short answer is “yes.” As you’ll see in our [Pixel 6 review](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/google-pixel-6) and [Pixel 6 Pro review](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/google-pixel-6-pro), both phones deliver great cameras, responsive displays and plenty of power through the new Tensor chip.\n\nThe only major caveat for the Pixel 6 series is battery life. Both phones turned in below-average endurance on the Tom’s Guide battery test, which involves continuous web surfing over 5G at 150 nits of screen brightness.\n\n* [Google Pixel 6 vs Pixel 6 Pro](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/google-pixel-6-vs-pixel-6-pro-biggest-differences-to-expect): Biggest differences\n* The [best phones](https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-phones) right now\n* **Plus:** [Google Pixel 6 — 5 reasons to buy and 3 to skip](https://www.tomsguide.com/opinion/google-pixel-6-5-reasons-to-buy-and-3-to-skip)\n\nFor context, the phones on our [best phone battery life](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/smartphones-best-battery-life,review-2857.html) list last all last 11 hours or more, and we consider 10 hours or longer above average. \n\nThe Pixel 6’s 4,614 mAh battery lasted only 8 hours and 1 minute on our test with the screen set to static or 60Hz mode. On adaptive mode, which sales the refresh rate from 60Hz up to 90Hz, we saw as high as 8:13. Not good. \n\n**ModelBattery life (hours:mins)Google Pixel 6**8:13**Google Pixel 6 Pro**7:53**iPhone 13 Pro Max**12:16**iPhone 13 Pro**11:42**iPhone 13**10:33**iPhone 13 mini**8:41**Samsung Galaxy S21**9:53**Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus**9:50**Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra**11:25**OnePlus 9 Pro**12:48\n\nSurprisingly, the Pixel 6 Pro turned in an even worse 7 hours and 53 minutes on our battery test, despite having a larger 5,000 mAh battery. In adaptive mode the Pixel 6 Pro lasted 7:46 or about the same time.\n\nBy comparison, the [iPhone 13](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-13) lasted 10 hours and 33 minutes on our web surfing test and the [iPhone 13 Pro Max ](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-13-pro-max)hit 12:16. The [Samsung Galaxy S21](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s21) endured for 9:53 and the [Galaxy S21 Ultra](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-pros-and-cons) endured for 11:25. Last but not least, the [OnePlus 9 Pro](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/oneplus-9-pro) lasted an excellent 12:48.\n\nInterestingly, we tested the regular Pixel 6 a couple of times over 4G as well and it averaged 10 hours and 52 minutes. That's great, but we would like to see better results over 5G.\n\nSo what’s going on here? We have a couple of theories. For one, we tested the Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro at 77% brightness for our battery test, as that’s what it took to get to our required 150 nits. Other phones tend to reach that nit level at around 50% brightness, but we wanted to keep the comparisons fair.\n\nSecond, the [Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro reportedly use an older Samsung modem](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/google-pixel-6s-is-a-year-behind-other-flagships-heres-why) found in the Galaxy S20 series. It's over a year old at this point. We suspect that this modem is not nearly as efficient as new Qualcomm modems in today’s flagships.\n\nTo be fair, no one is going to surf the web continuously until the battery dies, and our test is not designed to mirror real-world use. In fact, thanks to Google’s Tensor chip and tools like Extreme Energy Saver mode, you should be able to get through most of the day (if not more) on a charge.\n\nBut when it comes to tasks that utilize 5G on the go, the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are definitely a a step behind the competition when it comes to battery life. \n\n* **More:** [Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 is a game changer for my productivity — here's why](https://www.tomsguide.com/opinion/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-is-a-game-changer-for-my-productivity-heres-why)\n\nToday's best Google Pixel Buds A-Series deals\n\n[£99.99](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8900245-14326523?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2Fgb%2Fproduct%2F_pixel_buds_series_a_clearly_white&sid=tomsguide-row-9404847140520722000)\n\n[VIEW](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8900245-14326523?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2Fgb%2Fproduct%2F_pixel_buds_series_a_clearly_white&sid=tomsguide-row-9404847140520722000)\n\n[£99.99](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8900245-14326523?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2Fgb%2Fproduct%2F_pixel_buds_series_a_dark_olive&sid=tomsguide-row-1258493230515161600)\n\n[VIEW](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8900245-14326523?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2Fgb%2Fproduct%2F_pixel_buds_series_a_dark_olive&sid=tomsguide-row-1258493230515161600)\n\n[No price information](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3DGoogle+Pixel+Buds+A-Series%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-row-7924947329053938000-20)\n\n[CHECK AMAZON](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3DGoogle+Pixel+Buds+A-Series%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-row-7924947329053938000-20)\n\nWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n[Mark Spoonauer](https://www.tomsguide.com/author/mark-spoonauer)\n\n* \n\nMark Spoonauer is the global editor in chief of Tom's Guide and has covered technology for nearly 20 years.

Below is a transcript of the video posted online:*\n\n> \"It's been said in the press that I was invited to speak to the transgender employees of Netflix and I refused. That is not true — if they had invited me I would have accepted it, although I am confused about what we would be speaking about. I said what I said, and boy, I heard what you said. My God, how could I not? You said you want a safe working environment at Netflix. It seems like I'm the only one who can't go to the office.\"\n>\n> \"I want everyone in this audience to know that even though the media frames it that it's me versus that community, that's not what it is. Do not blame the LGBTQ community for any of this. It's about corporate interests, and what I can say, and what I cannot say. For the record, and I need you to know this, everyone I know from that community has been loving and supportive, so I don't know what this nonsense is about.\"\n>\n> \"This film that I made was invited to every film festival in the United States. Some of those invitations I accepted. When this controversy came out about 'The Closer', they began disinviting me from these film festivals. And now, today, not a film company, not a movie studio, not a film festival, nobody will touch this film. Thank God for Ted Sarandos and Netflix, he's the only one that didn't cancel me yet.\"\n>\n> \"To the transgender community, I am more than willing to give you an audience, but you will not summon me. I am not bending to anyone's demands. And if you want to meet with me, I am more than willing to, but I have some conditions. First of all, you cannot come if you have not watched my special from beginning to end.

This is with live ammunition.

Though we were not made aware of any official complaints concerning weapon or prop safety on set, we will be conducting an internal review of our procedures while production is shut down. We will continue to cooperate with the Santa Fe authorities in their investigation and offer mental health services to the cast and crew during this tragic time.\"\n\nThis aerial photo shows the Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Saturday, October 23, 2021.\n\nThe incident happened at the Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Thursday.\n\nSouza, who was injured in the shoulder, told investigators the prop gun went off as Baldwin was practicing drawing his gun, according to an affidavit for a search warrant.\n\nSouza spoke to investigators Friday, according to the affidavit released by the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office on Sunday.\n\nSouza told them Baldwin was \"sitting in a pew in a church building setting, and he was practicing a cross draw,\" the affidavit said. A cross draw is when a shooter pulls the weapon from a holster on the opposite side of the body from the draw hand.\n\nSouza was looking over Hutchins' shoulder \"when he heard what sounded like a whip and then loud pop,\" according to the affidavit.\n\nSouza also confirmed to an investigator that he heard the term \"cold gun\" on set, meaning the firearm should have been empty.\n\n[Halyna Hutchins: In her own words](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/25/entertainment/halyna-hutchins-words/index.html)\n\nAccording to the warrant, Souza said three people had been handling the firearms for scenes -- they were checked by the armorer and first assistant director and then given to the actor using them.\n\nThe investigator said Souza was unaware of anyone on set being checked to see whether they had live ammunition on them before or after the scenes were filmed.\n\n\"The only thing checked are the firearms to avoid live ammunition being in them. Joel (Souza) stated there should never be live rounds whatsoever near or around the scene,\" the affidavit said.\n\nSouza's representatives have not returned CNN's requests for comment.\n\nNo charges have been filed. The Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office says it will discuss the case further in a news conference Wednesday.\n\n### Prior incidents reported on set\n\nThere were at least two accidental prop gun discharges on the \"Rust\" set in the days before the fatal shooting, according to multiple news reports.\n\nThe discharges occurred on October 16, when crew members accidentally fired two rounds after being told the gun was \"cold,\" [the Los Angeles Times reported](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-10-22/alec-baldwin-rust-camera-crew-walked-off-set), citing two crew members who reportedly witnessed the incident.

She “filled up this room with energy” according to John Legend, giving the track a Jon Bon Jovi/“Blaze of Glory” stadium vibe.\n\nBut sadly, Hailey’s glory was short-lived. Unfortunately for her, her Knockouts competitor, Cameroonian chanteuse Libianca, spectacularly performed Billie Eilish's “Everything I Wanted.” And while Libianca, who has both depression and anxiety, struggled and even sobbed during rehearsal, she delivered a confident, jazzy performance that John described as a “master class” once she hit the main stage.\n\n“There was no way in hell I was going to let Libianca leave. I feel like she had the tallest mountain to climb, and she was able to get it together. As a coach, there's no way I can't reward that,” Blake explained. Still, Blake confessed that letting Hailey go, especially after she sang his own song, absolutely crushed his soul. “My heart's broken right now,” he lamented.\n\nStory continues\n\nTRENDING\n\n‘Genius' performance has 'DWTS' fans and judges losing their minds\nYahoo TV·2 min read\n\nDave Chappelle says he's 'more than willing' to meet with transgender employees at Netflix — but there are conditions\nYahoo Entertainment·3 min read\n\nOlivia Jade says she faces constant 'guilt and stress' in the wake of college admissions scandal\nYahoo Entertainment·3 min read\n\nThe It List: Selena Gomez goes blonde in Season 3 of her cooking show, Guillermo del Toro-produced 'Antlers' debuts, animated 'Star Trek' series for kids premieres and the best in pop culture the week of Oct. 25, 2021\nYahoo Entertainment·13 min read\n\nThe Go-Go's' Gina Schock talks photo book, Rock Hall, and open-heart surgery at age 26: 'We took that trip to Palm Springs in case I didn't make it.

{"id": "8n37edZJqX-5aFcNAm3pDJIJthewV7Gy9sCjZ4Wj73I", "title": "NFL Power Rankings: The Bengals Are No Fluke", "body": "The NFL’s Week 7 slate was a mostly ugly affair dominated by blowouts, but it did help us learn more about which teams are for real and which teams are not. The Cardinals held on to the top spot in this week’s rankings with an easy win over the Texans, but their grasp on no. 1 is tenuous at best with the Buccaneers, Rams, Cowboys, Bills, and Packers continuing to stake their claims as the best team in football. This week, the Titans even threw their name into that hat after an impressive win over the Chiefs. With seven weeks in the books, here are my updated Power Rankings.\n\nThe Top Shelf\n\n1. Arizona Cardinals (7-0)\n2. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-1)\n3. Los Angeles Rams (6-1)\n4. Dallas Cowboys (5-1)\n5. Buffalo Bills (4-2)\n6. Green Bay Packers (6-1)\n7. Tennessee Titans (5-2)\n   Aaron Rodgers has quietly rounded back into MVP form.\n   Rodgers’s shocking Week 1 stumble feels like nothing more than a distant memory at this point. In that 38-3 loss to the Saints, Rodgers’s tumultuous summer off the field seemed to bleed into his on-field performance: He mustered just 133 yards on 15 of 28 passing, throwing two picks and no touchdowns in an uncharacteristically listless performance. It was one of his worst outings ever, but in typical Rodgers fashion, he wrote the loss off as “just one game,” and quickly turned his focus to getting things fixed.\n\nSix weeks later, it’s safe to say that he, along with the rest of the Packers offense, has done just that. Rodgers was just about perfect in Green Bay’s 24-10 victory over Washington on Sunday―the team’s sixth consecutive win―completing 27 of 35 attempts for 274 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions, tallying a 127.6 passer rating. Rodgers connected with key role players in Allen Lazard and Robert Tonyan for scores and made sure to get superstar receiver Davante Adams in on the fun, doing so with some signature out-of-structure playmaking flair.\n\nLooking past Rodgers’s ugly Week 1 game, the 37-year-old is back to his MVP-caliber form. He’ll have to compete with younger and more dynamic competition in Kyler Murray and Josh Allen for those honors this year, and he still has to beat out the GOAT in Tom Brady, but from Week 2 on, Rodgers’s numbers stack up to anyone: Rodgers has tossed 15 touchdowns in that stretch, tied for third most behind only Brady and Matthew Stafford, and he’s surrendered just one pick; he’s second only to Dak Prescott in passer rating (118.6) in that time and ranks third in adjusted yards per attempt (9.5), trailing only Russell Wilson and Prescott; and crucially, he’s led his team to a perfect 6-0 record in that stretch, a tally matched only by Murray.\n\nAs fate would have it, Rodgers draws a matchup with Murray this week on Thursday Night Football. The Packers have mostly flown under the radar in the past two weeks with easy wins over bad teams (Washington this week, the Bears in Week 6), but Rodgers and Co. have the chance for a statement win over the league’s only remaining undefeated team.\n\nThe Titans are suddenly the NFL’s hottest team.\nIt’s easy to overreact to any NFL team’s performance in a given week, and I admit I was guilty of believing that the Titans were just straight-up bad when they lost to the Jets in Week 4. But by following up last week’s impressive win over the Bills with a comprehensive 27-3 dismantling of the Chiefs on Sunday, this Tennessee squad has not only flushed the memory of that Jets loss down the drain, but has quickly established itself as one of the teams to beat in a wide-open AFC.\n\nRELATED\n\nThe Winners and Losers of NFL Week 7\nThe Chiefs’ Issues Are Too Big for Even Patrick Mahomes to Cover\nThis Is the Best Lamar Jackson We’ve Ever Seen\nThe offense is finally firing on all cylinders under new offensive coordinator Todd Downing. Ryan Tannehill put together his most impressive game this year in the beatdown win, completing 21 of 27 passes for 270 yards with one touchdown, one pick, and another score on the ground. With the Chiefs selling out to stop Derrick Henry and the Titans’ intimidating ground game (Henry faced seven-plus defenders in the box on 26 of 29 rushes, per NFL Next Gen Stats), Tannehill did well to exploit holes in coverage, particularly on play-action passes. And when the Chiefs loaded up to bring pressure, he made sure to get rid of the ball quickly―as he did on his first-quarter back-shoulder touchdown throw to A.J. Brown. Kansas City managed to avoid any knockout haymakers from Henry (who finished with 86 yards on 29 carries, with his longest run being 11 yards), but the Titans showed that they’ve still got other punches in their repertoire. Brown made his mark early and often, and despite battling the effects of food poisoning for the second week in a row, posted his best game of the season, catching eight passes for 133 yards and a score. The bottom line was that for the second consecutive game, Tennessee showed the crucial ability to create chunk plays and score touchdowns points with its passing attack, which will remain a key variable for a team whose opponents are being forced to load up and try to limit the damage Henry can do.\n\nIt wasn’t shocking that the Titans’ offense gave the sievelike Chiefs defense trouble, but I’m not sure anyone could have predicted that Tennessee’s defense would limit the Patrick Mahomes–led offense to just three points. The Titans kept with an emerging strategy that teams have employed against Mahomes this season and blitzed the Kansas City signal-caller just one time on his 39 dropbacks, preferring instead to drop seven—and sometimes even eight—defenders into coverage. That extra man or two in coverage helped a banged-up Tennessee secondary avoid big busts down the field, and critically, the Titans’ defensive line was able to create pressure by rushing four. Denico Autry tallied two sacks and four quarterback hits, while Bud Dupree, Harold Landry, and Jeffery Simmons combined to dial up near-constant pressure (both Landry and Dupree got one sack apiece). The formula worked like a charm.\n\nOf course, it’d be folly to expect that type of shutdown performance from Tennessee’s injury-decimated defense week in and week out. But the offense does have the pieces to carry more than their fair share of the load. With Tannehill, Henry, and Brown at the vanguard, a locked-in Titans offense can go toe-to-toe with just about anyone in the NFL.\n\nThe Contenders\n8\\. Cincinnati Bengals (5-2)\n9\\. Baltimore Ravens (5-2)\n10\\. Los Angeles Chargers (4-2)\n11\\. Cleveland Browns (4-3)\n12\\. Las Vegas Raiders (5-2)\n13\\. Kansas City Chiefs (3-4)\nThe Bengals are no fluke.\nThe rigors of the long and arduous NFL season are typically pretty effective at separating the wheat from the chaff when it comes to the league’s contenders and pretenders, and the Broncos and Panthers are two examples of hot-starting squads that have quickly fallen back to Earth. For the Bengals, though, it’s getting harder and harder to believe they’re anything but the real deal.\n\nCincinnati’s surprising rise to the top spot in the AFC North can be attributed to a few important factors, but the performance of second-year quarterback Joe Burrow sits at the top of the list. Burrow started relatively slowly this year as the team worked to protect him as he built strength in his surgically repaired knee, but now seven weeks in we’re starting to see the former Heisman winner hit his stride. The Bengals have upped their tempo on offense and are passing at a much higher rate than what we saw earlier in the year. That buildup came to a head on Sunday in the team’s 41-17 blowout of the Ravens, when Burrow completed 23 of 38 passes for 416 yards with three touchdowns to just one pick. Burrow averaged nearly 11 yards per attempt in the game, connecting on separate touchdown passes of 82 yards, 55 yards, and 32 yards. In all, Burrow had eight passes go for 20-plus yards, providing a shining example for the way this newly explosive offense has evolved since last year. All five of the team’s touchdown drives on Sunday took fewer than five plays to complete.\n\nBurrow, who was locked in as he repeatedly picked apart Baltimore’s blitz schemes, certainly had some help. Rookie receiver Ja’Marr Chase in particular has been even better than advertised this season, which is saying a lot considering he was widely viewed as a generational talent. Chase has been a game changer for the Cincy offense from the moment he stepped onto the field, and he racked up another eight catches for 201 yards and a touchdown against the Ravens. His 82-yard touchdown midway through the third quarter opened the floodgates for the Bengals and helped pave the way for what became a blowout win. Throughout the year, Chase has shown the extraordinary ability to be both a field-stretching deep threat and a yards-after-the-catch creator. Chase ranks second in the NFL with 754 receiving yards, most all time for any receiver through his first seven games. Not shabby.\n\nThe Bengals have also gotten contributions on offense from running back Joe Mixon, receivers Tee Higgins and Tyler Boyd, and tight end C.J. Uzomah (who caught two touchdowns on Sunday) has been an impact playmaker. Defensively, Cincy has been better than expected, too―and turned up the heat against the Ravens, pressuring Lamar Jackson on 45 percent of his dropbacks on Sunday, the third-highest pressure rate he’s seen as a starter. Put it all together, and the Bengals have the look of a team that’s here to stay.\n\nThe Muddled Middle\n14\\. Minnesota Vikings (3-3)\n15\\. Pittsburgh Steelers (3-3)\n16\\. New England Patriots (3-4)\n17\\. New Orleans Saints (4-2)\n18\\. Indianapolis Colts (3-4)\n19\\. Atlanta Falcons (3-3)\n20\\. Chicago Bears (3-4)\n21\\. Carolina Panthers (3-4)\n22\\. Denver Broncos (3-4)\n23\\. Seattle Seahawks (2-5)\n24\\. New York Giants (2-5)\n25\\. San Francisco 49ers (2-4)\n26\\. Philadelphia Eagles (2-5)\n27\\. Washington Football Team (2-5)\nKyle Pitts is already on a historic pace.\nPitts―who, like Chase, earned a “generational” label during the pre-draft process―is already living up to the hype. The rookie tight end had his best game as a pro on Sunday, reeling in seven catches for 163 yards in the Falcons’ 30-28 win over the Dolphins. That performance, which included key receptions of 23 yards and 28 yards on the team’s game-winning drive, put Pitts at 471 receiving yards on the season, good for 19th most leaguewide and on pace to set a new rookie record at the position (1,413 yards).\n\nPitts isn’t just setting new standards for the number of yards he’s produced, though, he’s blazing new paths in the way in which he’s being utilized for the Falcons. Pitts has lined up all over the formation in head coach and play-caller Arthur Smith’s scheme, rotating assignments with 27 percent of his snaps coming in-line, 43 percent from the slot, and a whopping 30 percent out wide, per Pro Football Focus. On Sunday, Pitts caught four passes for 113 yards when lined up on the outside, per Next Gen Stats, setting a new mark for tight ends in their database. He’s also been utilized as a vertical receiver more effectively than any other tight end this season, per NGS, and has notched 10 catches for 255 yards on vertical routes this season, easily outpacing every other player at his position. All of that is a long way of saying that Pitts can line up anywhere on the field, beat press coverage, and make big plays downfield; he’s far more than your typical tight end―he’s a 6-foot-6, 246-pound receiver who just so happens to play tight end.\n\nUltimately, though, Pitts’s positional designation doesn’t matter; what matters is what he does when Matt Ryan targets him. And over the last few weeks, we’ve started to see the vision that Atlanta had for Pitts when they took him fourth overall. It’s starting to pay dividends not just for Ryan, but for the team’s entire offense.\n\nThere’s Always Next Year\n28\\. Houston Texans (1-6)\n29\\. Jacksonville Jaguars (1-5)\n30\\. Miami Dolphins (1-6)\n31\\. Detroit Lions (0-7)\n32\\. New York Jets (1-5)\nThe Lions won’t go gentle into that good night.\nIf there’s one thing that’s worse than being a bad team in the NFL, it’s being a bad team that’s also boring. The Lions aren’t a good team by anyone’s definition, but as they showed on Sunday in a 28-19 loss to the Rams, they at least seem determined to make things interesting every week.\n\nDetroit opened the game with a six-play, 75-yard scoring drive that was punctuated by a 63-yard touchdown scamper by running back D’Andre Swift. But head coach Dan Campbell knew that wasn’t going to be enough for his team to outlast a juggernaut like the Rams. Instead of kicking the ball back to L.A. and letting nature take its course, Campbell dialed up an onside kick on the ensuing kickoff―which Detroit recovered. That bold move, along with a fake punt that kept the drive alive, helped lead to a field goal on the team’s second possession and gave the Lions a quick 10-0 lead.\n\nUltimately, the trickery wasn’t enough to save the Lions (who hilariously converted another fake punt in the third quarter), and Detroit slowly succumbed to the superior Rams. But it helped make things a hell of a lot more interesting, and gave me a reason to stay glued to the game from start to finish. Campbell’s team is going to have a talent deficit against pretty much every team it will face this year, but I always find myself wanting to watch the Lions play. Detroit has taken on the identity of its head coach: They play hard, they figuratively bite kneecaps, and as we saw on Sunday, they’re not afraid of throwing the kitchen sink at opponents.\n\nIn This Stream\nEverything You Need to Know About Week 7 of the 2021 NFL Season\nNFL Power Rankings: The Bengals Are No Fluke\nLooking Ahead at the AFC Playoff Picture\nVIEW ALL 9 STORIES\nNext Up In NFL\nDan Campbell Isn’t Afraid to Go Down Swinging\nMust-Add Players for Week 8\nBest World Series Cards to Buy, NBA Hot and Cold, NFL News, and Mailbag Questions\nTrent Dilfer on the Bengals’ Statement Win, Chiefs Disaster, and Tua Optimism\nLooking Ahead at the AFC Playoff Picture\nThe Chiefs’ Issues Are Too Big for Even Patrick Mahomes to Cover", "timestamp": 1635250474, "digest": "Dl4PdPtyHnKrM25naOBqE7M8CeenCrQu6OyUQmS8Wbo", "contributor": "0x8545f0833b3238480B8e72e22fC0E69Fa84d1cf2"}

Crew-3 therefore remains on track to lift off early on Halloween morning (Oct. 31), NASA and SpaceX announced Monday (Oct. 25).\n\n\"We had a good review today,\" Joel Montalbano, NASA's ISS program manager, said during a news conference Monday evening after the FRR wrapped up. \n\n[Sponsored Links](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=futureplc-space&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-a-mid:Mid%20Article:)\n\n[ソフトバンクが共創アイデアコンテストを開催中！応募は10月31日までSoftbank x TC Brand Studio](https://jp.techcrunch.com/sponsored/creativestudios_softbank_contest/?vmbtid=tb02&utm_source=taboola&utm_medium=referral&tblci=GiAs2ICwUrJnBReoiecv8_MSoK2ub629Qeuw7Kethxs0WSCuv04ozPreq8HIx58T#tblciGiAs2ICwUrJnBReoiecv8_MSoK2ub629Qeuw7Kethxs0WSCuv04ozPreq8HIx58T)\n\n**[Live updates: SpaceX's Crew-3 mission to the space station for NASA](https://www.space.com/news/live/spacex-crew-dragon-mission-updates)**\n\n[Click here for more Space.com videos...](https://videos.space.com/m/oKaCxH8j/meet-the-spacex-crew-3-astronauts?list=9wzCTV4g)\n\nThe review revealed no surprises, Montalbano said. But that doesn't mean the NASA and [SpaceX](https://www.space.com/18853-spacex.html) teams aren't working on any issues. Indeed, they need to resolve one outstanding item before Crew-3 can lift off — a slight redesign of [Crew Dragon's toilet system](https://www.space.com/inspiration4-spacex-toilet-trouble-in-space).\n\nThat tweak was prompted by an issue experienced on SpaceX's [Inspiration4](https://www.space.com/spacex-inspiration4-mission-photos) mission, which sent four private citizens on a three-day trip to orbit last month. After that capsule, named Resilience, returned home, inspections revealed that a tube hooked up to a toilet storage tank had popped loose during flight. \n\nThis \"allowed urine to not go into the storage tank but, essentially, to go into the fan system,\" Bill Gerstenmaier, vice president of build and flight reliability at SpaceX, said during Monday's news conference. But the leak didn't markedly affect Inspiration4, he added.\n\n\"We didn't really even notice it; the crew didn't notice it until we got back\" to Earth, Gerstenmaier said.\n\nStill, SpaceX decided to revamp the toilet system on the Crew-3 capsule, [known as Endurance](https://www.space.com/spacex-crew-dragon-capsule-named-endurance), going with an all-welded structure to eliminate tube pop-offs, Gerstenmaier said. NASA needs to give the redesign a final thumbs-up before Crew-3 can fly, but that is expected to happen in the coming days.\n\nThe toilet issue could potentially apply to another Crew Dragon: the capsule known as Endeavour, which flew SpaceX's [Crew-2](https://www.space.com/spacex-crew-2-space-station-mission-photos) mission and is still docked to the ISS. Endeavour is scheduled to come back to Earth with the four Crew-2 astronauts soon — on Nov. 4, if Crew-3 launches on time.\n\nAstronauts on the orbiting lab have examined Endeavour, looking for signs of corrosion caused by leaked urine (or rather, by an additive that SpaceX puts into the Crew Dragon septic system to remove ammonia from urine). They haven't found anything troublesome, and analyses by teams here on Earth indicate that all should be well for Crew-2's return, Gerstenmaier said.\n\nHe also noted that leakage on Crew-2 was likely significantly lower than on Inspiration4, given that crewmembers used Endeavour's toilet only during its 24-hour trip to the space station rather than for three full days.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n—[SpaceX's Dragon: First private spacecraft to reach the space station](https://www.space.com/18852-spacex-dragon.html) \n —[How to watch NASA's SpaceX Crew-3 astronaut launch events this week](https://www.space.com/spacex-crew-3-nasa-astronaut-launch-webcasts) \n —[Crew-3 astronauts are ready and excited for 6-month SpaceX mission](https://www.space.com/crew-3-astronauts-nasa-spacex-excited-launch)\n\nCrew-3 is scheduled to launch atop a SpaceX [Falcon 9](https://www.space.com/18962-spacex-falcon-9.html) rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 2:21 a.m. EDT (0621 GMT) on Sunday.

While there is still work to be done to get to launch, with continued integrated tests and Wet Dress Rehearsal, seeing the fully stacked SLS is certainly a reward for all of us.” \n\nTesting includes interface verification testing, program-specific engineering testing, end-to-end communications testing, countdown sequencing testing and wet dress rehearsal testing.\n\n[According to Space.com](https://www.space.com/nasa-sls-megarocket-artemis-1-moon-launch-february-2022), in a Friday media briefing, deputy associate administrator for exploration systems development at NASA Headquarters Tom Whitmeyer told reporters that the stacked rocket and crew capsule will roll out to the Launch Pad 398 in late December for testing and west dress rehearsal testing in January before going back for more checkouts followed by another move onto the pad.\n\n“Prior to rolling out to the pad for wet dress, teams will conduct the first of a two-part test of the flight termination system inside the VAB. Once the systems are verified, the 322-foot-tall rocket will roll back into the VAB for final inspections and checkouts, including the second part of the flight termination system test, ahead of returning to the pad for launch.,” NASA wrote, noting that Artemis I mission operations teams would continue to run additional launch simulations leading up to launch.\n\nThe agency said it would set a specific launch date following a successful wet dress rehearsal.\n\nSLS is [powered by a core stage](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/0080_sls_fact_sheet_sept2020_09082020_final_0.pdf) with four RS-25 [liquid propellant](https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/energy) engines and twin five-segment solid rocket boosters that produce millions of pounds of thrust.\n\nNASA already fired up the core stage and its engines twice this year to ensure that the rocket’s components were working – though the first hot fire test in January ended early due to a hydraulic system issue.\n\nNASA [eventually completed](https://apnews.com/article/science-moon-ef9d50920f77b510ef59f0ed0089d558) the engine test firing of its moon rocket in March. \n\n[The 1972 Apollo 17 mission](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo17.html) was the last in which humans traveled to the moon.\n\n### SHARE THIS ARTICLE:\n\n* [Facebook](https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/nasa-targeting-february-for-launch-of-first-moon-rocket-since-apollo-mission/?share=facebook&nb=1)\n* [Twitter](https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/nasa-targeting-february-for-launch-of-first-moon-rocket-since-apollo-mission/?share=twitter&nb=1)\n* [Flipboard](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=NASA%20targeting%20February%20for%20launch%20of%20first%20moon%20rocket%20since%20Apollo%20mission&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2021%2F10%2F25%2Fnasa-targeting-february-for-launch-of-first-moon-rocket-since-apollo-mission%2F&t=1635250555033&utm_campaign=tools&utm_medium=article-share&utm_source=nypost.com)\n* \n* [Email](https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/nasa-targeting-february-for-launch-of-first-moon-rocket-since-apollo-mission/?share=email&nb=1)\n* [Copy](https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/nasa-targeting-february-for-launch-of-first-moon-rocket-since-apollo-mission/)\n* \n\nFILED UNDER\n\n* [MOON](https://nypost.com/tag/moon/)\n* [NASA](https://nypost.com/tag/nasa/)\n* [SPACE](https://nypost.com/tag/space/)\n* [10/25/21](https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/)\n\n[READ NEXTWhy Facebook whistleblower and her 'crypto friends' moved ...](https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/why-facebook-whistleblower-and-her-crypto-friends-moved-to-puerto-rico/)\n\n*SPONSORED STORIES*\n\n* [Sting Buys Another Robert A.M.

{"id": "6QIqQ-QJHEoPiuFNPehQJ9RFGrGmGo6AdEarH8VbT_Y", "title": "That Exciting Signal Thought to Be From Proxima Centauri Has Now Been Resolved", "body": "In December last year, the media reported [an intriguing signal](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/dec/18/scientists-looking-for-aliens-investigate-radio-beam-from-nearby-star) we at the [Breakthrough Listen](https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/initiative/1) project found in our radio telescope data. Dubbed BLC1, the signal didn't appear to be the result of any recognizable astrophysical activity or any familiar Earth-based interference.\n\nThe trouble was, we weren't ready to discuss it. When you're searching for signs of extraterrestrial life, you want to be very careful about getting it right before you make any announcements. Last year we had only just started secondary verification tests, and there were too many unanswered questions.\n\nToday we are ready to report that BLC1 is, sadly, not a signal from intelligent life beyond Earth. Rather, it is radio interference that closely mimics the type of signal we've been looking for. Our results are reported in [two](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01479-w) [papers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01508-8) in *Nature Astronomy*.\n\n## Searching for solar flares and signs of life\n\nThe story of BLC1 starts in April 2019, when Andrew Zic, who at the time was a PhD student at the University of Sydney, began observing the nearby star Proxima Centauri with multiple telescopes to search for flare activity. At 4.22 light years away, Proxima Centauri is our nearest stellar neighbor, but it is too faint to see with the naked eye.\n\nFlares from stars are bursts of energy and hot plasma that may impact (and likely destroy) the atmosphere of any planets in their path. Though the Sun produces flares, they are not strong or frequent enough to disrupt life on Earth. Understanding how and when a star flares teaches us a lot about whether those planets might be suitable for life.\n\nProxima Centauri hosts an Earth-sized exoplanet called Proxima Centauri b, and Andrew's observations suggested the planet is [buffeted by fierce \"space weather\"](https://theconversation.com/bad-space-weather-may-make-life-impossible-near-proxima-centauri-150979). While bad space weather doesn't rule out life existing in the Proxima Centauri system, it does mean the planet's surface is likely to be inhospitable.\n\nStill, as our nearest neighbor, Proxima Centauri b remains a compelling target for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (or SETI). Proxima Centauri is one of the only stars we could potentially ever visit in our lifetime.\n\nAt the speed of light, a two-way trip would take 8.4 light years. We can't send a spaceship that fast, but there is hope that [a tiny camera on a light sail](https://theconversation.com/observing-the-universe-with-a-camera-traveling-near-the-speed-of-light-93994) could reach there in 50 years and beam back pictures.\n\nBecause of this, we joined forces with Andrew Zic and his collaborators, and used [CSIRO's Parkes telescope](https://www.csiro.au/en/about/facilities-collections/atnf/parkes-radio-telescope) (also known as Murriyang in the Wiradjuri language) to run SETI observations in parallel with the flare activity search.\n\n(Smith et al., Nature Astronomy)\n\n*Above: The BLC1 signal. Each panel in the plot is an observation toward Proxima Centauri ('on source'), or toward a reference source ('off source'). BLC1 is the yellow drifting line, and is only present when the telescope is pointed at Proxima Centauri.*\n\n## An intriguing summer project\n\nWe thought searching these observations would be an excellent project for a summer student. In 2020, Shane Smith, an undergraduate student from Hillsdale College in Michigan, United States, joined the Berkeley SETI Research Experience for Undergraduates [program](https://seti.berkeley.edu/Internship.html) and began sifting through the data. Toward the end of his project, BLC1 popped out.\n\nThe Breakthrough Listen team quickly became intrigued by BLC1. However, the burden of proof to claim a detection of life beyond Earth is exceedingly high, so we don't let ourselves get too excited until we've applied every test we can think of. The analysis of BLC1 was spearheaded by Sofia Sheikh, at the time a PhD student at Penn State, who ran an exhaustive set of tests, many of which were new.\n\nThere was plenty of evidence pointing toward BLC1 being a genuine sign of extraterrestrial technology (or \"technosignature\"). BLC1 has many characteristics we expect from a technosignature:\n\n* we only saw BLC1 when we were looking toward Proxima Centauri, and didn't see it in when we looked elsewhere (in \"off-source\" observations). Interfering signals are commonly seen in all directions, as they \"leak\" into the telescope receiver\n* the signal only occupies one narrow band of frequencies, whereas signals from stars or other astrophysical sources occur over a much wider range\n* the signal slowly drifted in frequency over a 5-hour period. A frequency drift is expected for any transmitter not fixed to Earth's surface, as its movement relative to us will cause a Doppler effect\n* the BLC1 signal persisted for several hours, making it unlike other interference from artificial satellites or aircraft that we have observed before.\n\nNevertheless, Sofia's analysis led us to conclude BLC1 is most likely radio interference from right here on Earth. Sofia was able to show this by searching across the entire frequency range of the Parkes receiver and finding \"lookalike\" signals, whose characteristics are mathematically related to BLC1.\n\nUnlike BLC1, the lookalikes *do* appear in off-source observations. As such, BLC1 is guilty by association of being radio interference.\n\n## Not the technosignature we were looking for\n\nWe don't know exactly where BLC1 was coming from, or why it wasn't detected in off-source observations like the lookalike signals. Our best guess is that BLC1 and the lookalikes are generated by a process called *intermodulation*, where two frequencies mix together to create new interference.\n\nIf you've listened to blues or rock guitar, you are probably familiar with intermodulation. When a guitar amp is deliberately overdriven (when you turn it up to 11), intermodulation adds a pleasant-sounding distortion to the clean guitar signal. So BLC1 is – perhaps – just an unpleasant distortion from a device with an overdriven radio frequency amplifier.\n\nRegardless of what caused BLC1, it was not the technosignature we were looking for. It did, however, make for an excellent case study, and showed that our detection pipelines are working and picking up unusual signals.\n\nProxima Centauri is only one of many hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way.

Berger《与社会学同游——人文主义的视角》**\n\n\n社会学的产生\n社会学是现代西方特有的思想成果，而且它包含了一种独特的现代意识形式。\n只有文化的自我概念（尤其是文化里法定的、权威的和被普遍接受的自我概念）经历过剧烈的振荡，敏锐的人才可能超越文化自我概念的断言去思考问题，才可能去拷问权威。\n阿尔伯特·萨洛蒙证明，只有在基督教世界的规定性结构瓦解之后，只有在法国大革命摧毁规定性的社会政治制度之后，现代社会学意义上的“社会”概念才能够出现。\n我们可以再次将“社会”构想为大厦的隐蔽结构，大厦的外表遮蔽了内部结构。在中世纪的基督教世界里，威严的宗教一政治外表使“社会”隐蔽无形，这一宗教一政治显形的外表构成了欧洲人的日常世界。正如萨洛蒙所云，宗教改革使基督教世界的团结瓦解之后，绝对权力的国家展现出更加世俗化的政治外表，然而和此前的基督教世界一样，这种政治外表起到的是相同的作用。绝对权力的国家瓦解之后，“社会”的底层框架才进入人们的视野。 “社会”是动机和力量的世界，是不能用官方对社会现实的解释来理解的。例如，社会学家想要知道的是“非正式权力结构”（对此研究感兴趣的美国社会学家弗洛伊德·亨特所用的术语）的构成情况，这是由人及其权力组成的结构形态。\n\n\n社会学的视角\n社会学家的问题万变不离其宗：“人们如何互动？”“他们的关系如何？”“这些关系在机构里是如何组织的？”“推动人和机构的集体观念是什么？”\n社会学视角并不有助于我们产生登高望远的观点，而是在一定程度上对主日学校和公民教育里对社会现实的解释产生祛魅作用。\n社会学的视角使我们用新的目光去审视我们生活于其中的非常熟悉的世界。社会学家活动的领域是他熟悉的领域，在普通人的世界里游走，和大多数人称为真实的世界贴近。召唤他的还有另一种令人激动的发现——不是发现全然陌生的东西，而是发现熟悉的东西发生了意义上的变化。\n\n\n社会学的人性价值\n平民焦点：\n社会学方法中兴趣的平民焦点，即仔细研究其他学者可能认为平淡无奇、不值得作为科学研究对象的事情。人的一切所作所为都能够成为社会学研究的重要课题。\n善于倾听：\n社会学家需要仔细倾听他人的倾诉而不必提出自己的意见。倾听里至少潜藏着一定的人性化意义，因为在我们这个神经紧张、偏爱饶舌的时代里，几乎没有人愿意抽出时间去专心致志地倾听别人的意见。\n评价责任：\n社会学最后一个独特的人性价值是社会学家承担着对自己的发现作出评价的责任。在他心理上能够承担的范围内，他的评价不能顾及自己的偏见、好恶、希望或畏惧。\n\n\n社会学的意义\n社会学是非常具有现代性的、很合时宜的批判性思想形式。社会学的认识使我们对这样的社会观念机制持怀疑态度：社会把光明分配给一些人，把黑暗分配给另一些人（包括略微修补后把黑暗和“病态”画等号的现代机制）。\n社会学知识有利于培育这样的意识：所有人都在为自己的命运抗争；在属于自己的短暂的生命里，人的身份随时受到威胁，显得格外珍贵，人必须要为界定自己的身份而抗争。\n社会学最大的贡献在于，它有利于确立人的主体性，有助于人逃离社会的“监狱”、“陷阱”和“木偶操纵线”，鼓励人去追求自由。\n\n\n社会学意识的四个母题\n社会学意识的第一个母题是“揭露真相”。揭露真相是社会学的固有逻辑：社会学揭露真相的母题并不是心理学的母题，而是方法论的母题。社会学的参考框架有一个内置的方法论，社会学研究的现实的层次并非官方所解释的层次，它带有揭露真相的逻辑必然性，社会学有责任揭示人们用来掩盖互动的托词和宣传。这种揭露真相的责任是社会学的特点之一，它尤其精于把握当代社会的脾气。\n社会学家常用“意识形态”这个字眼来揭露既得利益群体使自己具有合法性的真相。“某一思想为社会上的某一既得利益服务时，我们就把这种思想称为意识形态”。意识形态经常地，即使不是一贯地、系统地扭曲社会现实，以便插足它能够插足的地方。社会学揭露真相的母题就是穿透言词的烟幕，深人到行为背后去发现人们不会承认的，而且常常使人不愉快的行为动机。\n社会学意识的第二个母题是“不恭敬的态度”。\n社会学意识里这种不敬的母题未必隐含着革命的态度。社会学的认识本身就敌视革命的意识形态，这并不是因为社会学有一种保守的偏向，而是因为它不仅看穿了对现状的幻灭感，而且看穿了对未来的虚幻的期待（虚幻的期待就是革命者习惯性的精神营养），因此具有一种非革命性的、温和的清醒意识。\n不敬的态度可以表现为情绪，也可以表现为意志，但无论其表现形式如何，不敬的态度始终应该是社会学家头脑里的一种可能性。这种态度可能会与他生活的其他方面隔离开来，也可能掩藏在日常的心态之下，甚至在意识形态上遭到否定。\n社会学意识的第三个母题是“中性化趋势”，第四个母题是“世界眼光”。\n社会学思想的实质接近于尼采所谓的“怀疑的艺术”。完全的思想尊敬必然意味着社会学的死亡。真正的社会学研究在极权主义的国家很快就消失得无影无踪，纳粹德国就是很好的例子。\n社会学的认识有一个隐含的意义：对警察和其他公共秩序的守护者的头脑而言，它始终是一个潜在的危险，因为它总是倾向于使绝对正确的断言中性化，而警察等守护者的头脑总是以这样的断言为依托。\n社会学代表的意识是价值完全中性化了的世界的意识。现代社会的地理流动和社会流动速度前所未有，因而自己的文化，包括基本的价值观在时间和空间上都只具有相对性。\n\n\n社会学对自我的微观分析\n“过去是可变的、易变的、不断变化的，这是因为我们回忆过去的经历时往往反复进行新的解释。所以我们说，一个人有多少观点，他就有多少不同的人生经历。”\n从社会学的角度来看，自我不再是铁板一块，不再是从一个情景过渡到另一个情景的既定实体。更加准确地说，自我是一个过程，不断被创造和再创造的过程，人进人每一个社会情景时自我都要发生变化，自我靠纤细的记忆之绳串联在一起。\n\n\n人在社会——社会决定论的几个主题\n“自我”的社会定位、社会控制机制、社会分层、社会情景和制度\n（1）“自我”的社会定位\n如果我们接受涂尔干的观点，那么社会就是横亘在我们面前的客观实在。社会就在那里，不能否认，必须面对。社会外在于我们，包围我们，涵盖我们生活的一切方面。我们生活在社会中，定位于社会体系的某些具体部分。我们的定位几乎预先决定和界定了我们所做的一切：从语言到礼仪，从宗教信仰到自杀的可能性。在社会定位上，社会不考虑我们的愿望。我们从精神上对社会规定和禁令的反抗会于事无补，而且常常是徒劳无益的。社会是客观和外在的事实，特别以压制的形式面对我们。社会制度形塑我们的行为，甚至塑造我们的期望。\n社会是一个历史实体，在时间上它超越了任何个人的生命历程。社会走在我们身前，存在于我们身后。我们出生之前，社会已然存在，我们去世之后它将继续存在。我们的生命只不过是漫长岁月里社会宏伟征途中短暂的插曲而已。社会是让我们身陷囹圄的历史囚笼。\n（2）群体动力学原理\n求得共识的压力难以避免，人极其渴望被群体接受，无论周围的群体是什么样的群体。这种欲望可以很有效地被操纵，群体治疗师、蛊惑人心者和其他实施共识工程（consensus engineering）的专门化人才就善于操纵人的欲望。\n（3）社会行为与社会现实\n韦伯强调社会行为的意图，涂尔干对社会行为的意图则缺乏兴趣。涂尔干强调社会现实的外在性、客观性，强调社会现实状若“事物”的性质 （“本质”quiddity）。韦伯的主张与此对立，强调主观的意义、意图和解释，这些是行为者参与社会情景时带进来的东西。韦伯同时指出，社会中最终发生的事情可能和行为者的意图截然不同。然而他断言，必须要考虑主观这个维度的全貌，才能够获得充分的社会学知识（verstehen，文化知解法）——社会学知识要对社会里存在的意义作出解释。\n涂尔干和韦伯看社会的方式并不是逻辑上矛盾的方式。它们只不过是对立的表述而已，因为它们集中关注的是社会现实的不同方面。社会是客观事实，社会压制甚至制造我们一这样说是完全正确的。但我们有意义的行为支撑着社会大厦，有时还协助改变社会大厦——这样说也是正确的。\n实际上，这两句话包含了社会存在的悖论：社会界定我们，又反过来被我们界定。我们与社会合作、共谋。然而，一旦我们用合作、共谋的观点看社会，而不是用被社会压制和制造的观点来看社会，社会看起来就很脆弱。我们要生存下去就需要得到社会的承认，以此获得自我形象和身份；社会也需要得到许多像我们一样的普通人的承认，否则它就不能存在。\n\n\n社会在人——角色理论、知识社会学、参照群体理论\n（1）角色理论与游戏社会\n角色理论认为，人的身份是被动接受的，不是主动选择的。从社会学的视角看，身份是社会赋予，并由社会支撑和转换的。\n米德认为，社会角色是通过游戏学会的。如果整个社会不具备人为的性质，社交的人为性就不可能成立。社交就是“游戏社会” （playing society）的一种特殊情况，游戏者对其虚构性更加自觉。而社交也是更为宏大的社会结构的一部分，你同样能够与之游戏。通过这样的游戏，儿童学会了扮演“认真”的角色。在社交的过程中，我们在有些时刻回到了童年时代戴着面具的游戏生活里，这也许就是社交的乐趣。\n齐美尔的社交理论认为，社交是社会互动的游戏形式，游戏可以作为减轻压力的手段。此外，赫伊津哈把游戏作为人和社会的本质特征，对游戏的定位如下：“除非把人当作游戏的物种,除非研究人游戏和游乐的一面,否则我们就不可能把握人类文化”。\n（2）知识社会学\n在围绕世界观的大辩论中，社会学提出“谁说的？”这样一个恼人的问题。知识社会学回答“谁说的？”这个问题，试图清理从思想到思想者再到他所处的社会环境的发展脉络”。\n社会学视角引进了一丝令人清醒的怀疑要素，这种怀疑态度立竿见影，给人提供保护，使人不至于立即改变自己的信仰。社会学意识的参考框架使人能够以这样的态度去感受自己的经历：人的生活阅历是在若干具体的社会环境里流动的，所有的社会环境都附带着具体的意义体系。这样的社会学意识当然不能够解决何为真理的问题，但它使我们不那么容易掉进人生旅途中遭遇的每一个传教团设置的陷阱。\n（3）参照群体理论\n如果说知识社会学赋予我们构建社会现实的广阔视野，那么参照群体理论就向我们展示许多小作坊，其中那些构建世界的小群体就在锻造他们心中的宇宙模型。\n这个过程中隐蔽的社会心理动力学大概和角色理论的社会心理动力学大同小异。这样的社会心理动力大概是一种原始的欲望：被人接受、有一定归属并与人共同生活在一个世界里。\n\n\n社会学与人的自由\n按照盖伦的制度理论的解释，制度疏导人的行为颇似本能疏导动物的行为。而两者之间存在着一个重大的差异：倘若动物能够反思自己的本能，它一定会说，“我别无选择”；同样，在解释自己为何服从制度的要求时，人们也会说，“我别无选择”。唯一的区别是，动物说的是实情，人却是在欺骗自己。\n因为实际上人能够对社会说“不”，而倘若他们采取这样的行动，他们可能就会遭遇令人不快的后果。人们甚至想都不去想把“不”付诸行动，因为他们把服从视为理所当然。他们在制度里生存的性质也许是他们唯一敢于想象的身份，其他的选择似乎是发疯。而这并不改变一个事实：“我必须”几乎在每一个社会情景里都是欺骗自己的谎言。\n人的“监狱”、“囚笼”、“枷锁”是自己和社会共同打造的。社会“是‘存在于内心’的现象，社会是在我们心灵最深处存在的一部分……只有理解了内化机制以后，我们才能够理解这个令人难以置信的事实：社会不仅控制着我们的行为，而且塑造着我们的身份、思想和情感。社会的结构成为我们意识的结构。我们受制于社会的枷锁，这个枷锁不是我们被征服后套在我们身上的，而是我们和社会合谋打造的。大多数时候，我们是被自己身上的社会性推入陷阱的。我们来到人世之前，禁锢我们的围墙就已经修好了，但却由我们自己来进行重建。我们与社会的合作就是对自己的背叛，我们自己纵身跳进了社会的陷阱。”\n我们看见木偶在小小的剧场里手舞足蹈，任随木偶线的操纵而上上下下，严格按照小小的角色规定进行表演。我们学会了理解木偶剧场的逻辑，发现自己在追随木偶的表演。在社会生活里，我们也被吊挂在操纵我们的“木偶线”上，我们借此给自己定位，并承认自己的定位。在一刹那间，我们觉得自己很像是木偶。不过随后，我们就捕捉住了木偶剧场和人生戏剧的深刻区别：我们可以停止木偶的演出动作，抬头仰望并感知操纵我们的那一套“木偶线”。这个停止演出的动作是我们走向自由的第一步。\n社会学框架本身不能验证自由。如果我们想要把自己的论述严格限定在社会学的参考框架里，我们根本就无法探讨自由，因为社会学的参考框架是一个科学的框架。效用和美不同，但不矛盾，效用话语和审美话语这两个世界严格地说是不能比较、不可通约的。同理，自由和因果关系（科学框架）并不矛盾，两者仅仅是不同的术语而已。\n萨特认为，人不但是自由的，而且“注定是自由的”（condemned to freedom）。有人借口“身不由己”、“不得已而为之”，其实是放弃了自由的选择，是逃避自由（弗洛姆），这就是“自欺”。所谓“自欺”就是把事实上自愿的行为假装成必需的行为。“自欺”就是逃离自由，就是不诚实地逃避“选择的痛苦”（agony of choice）。\n反犹主义（或任何其他形式的种族主义或狂热的民族主义）本质上是“自欺”的，因为它把人的全部属性等同于社会属性。于是，人性就成了没有自由的实实在在的东西。人们的爱恨杀戮都局限于一个神话世界里：在这个世界里人人都成了社会标签，比如纳粹冲锋队员就成了自己的徽章所示的符号，犹太人就成了集中营囚服上标记的深受鄙视的符号。\n海德格尔有关“人”的观念说明：如果在泛化的“人”中失去自我，那就是不自由。“这个观念与他探讨本真和非本真的观念有关联。所谓本真的存在就是生活在这样一种清醒的意识中：个人的个性是独一无二、不可替代、无与伦比的特性。与此相比，非本真的存在就是在匿名的‘人’中失去自我，就是把自己独一无二的特性拱手出让给社会构建的抽象概念。”\n海德格尔“人”的观念和我们的社会观的相关性，与其说表现在其规定性意义上，不如说表现在认知性意义上。在论述人的“自欺”意义时，我们把社会当作给人提供逃避自由的借口的机制；在说到海德格尔“人”的观念时，我们把社会当作防御恐惧的机制。\n社会为我们提供了被我们视之为理所当然的结构（ “安然无虞的世界”），社会是产生非本真存在的共谋。在这些结构里，只要我们遵守规则，我们就能够得到保护，就不至于受到生存境遇终极恐惧的威胁。\n波将金（Grigori Aleksandrovich Potemkin）据说为了取悦卡捷琳娜二世而在她巡游的沿途搭建外观悦目的假村庄，社会的墙壁正是竖立在深渊边缘的波将金的村庄 （Potemkin's village）。墙壁的功能是保护我们，使我们不受惊吓，为我们组织一个有意义的世界，使我们在这个世界里的生命有意义。\n而一切制度结构都必然依赖欺骗，社会上的一切存在物都带有一点自欺的成分。这个闪光的洞见乍一看令人十分压抑，但它实际上使我们管窥到另一个观点：社会的决定力量并不像我们所料的那样强大，我们依然可以寻求一种本真的生存，但本真的生存同样只能在社会里发生，一切意义都是在社会里传递的。一切通向思考存在的路径都有其社会定位——宗教、哲学、美学的路径都有其社会定位。社会既可能是逃避自由的借口，也可能是获得自由的机缘；同理，社会既可以埋葬我们的形而上求索，也可以提供形而上求索的形式。在这里，我们再次遭遇我们社会生存的无处不在的两面神悖论——社会生存既自由又不自由。社会为大多数人提供的是借口和波将金的村庄，作为自由之路的功能只为少数人开放。即使我们认为社会里的本真是可能的，大多数人也并没有利用这个可能性。\n\n\n社会暴政的逃生隧道：变革、超然和巧妙利用\n变革与神授魅力\n社会变革和革命可以推翻社会压力。一切变革都是先内后外的，内心的变革走在社会变革之前，内心的变革就是自由：“实际上，我们审视革命时发现，总是在反抗旧秩序的外在行为出现之前，内在的顺从和忠诚就已经瓦解了....早在社会制度被暴力推翻之前，已经由于人民的鄙视而失去了意识形态的支持。不承认社会规范、反对社会规范的定义总是具有潜在的革命威力。”\n“神授魅力（Charisma）对预先界定的力量构成最富有激情的挑战。它用新的意义取代旧的意义，以激进的方式重新界定关于人的存在的预设”。而在神授魅力运动中表现出来的超乎寻常的激情很难能超过一代人的岁月。神授魅力必然走进一个韦伯所谓的“常规化”过程。它会以不那么激进的形式重新整合进社会结构里。先知的后继者是教皇，革命者的后继者是行政官员。宗教革命或政治革命的大地震过去之后，人们在自己认为的新秩序里安顿下来生活，而结果必然证明，变革并不像起初看起来的那样彻底。造反的狂热冷却之后，经济利益和政治雄心就取而代之。旧习惯重新抬头，由神授魅力推动的革命产生的新秩序开始复旧，和其用强大暴力推翻的社会及政治制度表现出令人不安的相似性。\n超然与自我流放\n超然的态度可以减轻社会压力：倘若不能改变或破坏社会，可以在内心深处采取退让的姿态。超然的态度是抵抗社会控制的办法，这样的处事态度始于老子，斯多葛派把它发展成为一个抵抗的学说。超然的处事者退出社会舞台，隐居到自己的宗教、思想和艺术领域里，进入自我流放的境界，形成“亚文化”和“反社会”等圈子。\n巧妙利用与游离\n逃避社会暴政的第三种方法是“巧妙利用”。所谓巧妙利用，就是用正常运转之外的方式去利用社会制度。运用这种方法时，个人并不尝试去改变社会结构，也不对社会结构采取超然的态度。相反，他用社会结构的合法守护者未曾预料到的方式去有意识地利用这些社会结构，根据他自己的目的在社会丛莽中独辟蹊径。欧文.戈夫曼分析了“囚徒”（inmates）世界（包括精神病院、监狱和其他压迫机构），他提供的例子充分说明“巧妙利用制度”（work thesystem）为何能够成立。\n在这里，游离（ecstasy）是一个有用的概念。所谓的“游离”不是神秘而异常的意识高涨，而是其字面的意思——置身局外或步出理所当然的日常社会时的那种感觉，与自己的世界拉开距离。\n一旦个人不必用内心的投人去扮演角色时，一旦他刻意和假装扮演角色而不必内心投人时，扮演者就进人了“游离”的境界，就忘记了“理所当然的世界”。别人认为是命运使然，他却认为只是一套需要考虑的因素；别人认为是重要的身份，他却当作方便的伪装。“游离”改变了他的社会意识，以至于既定性（givenness）变成了可能性（possibility）。\n“游离”既有社会学的意义，也有形而上的意义。如果我们以“游离”的姿态走出“理所当然的世界”和“安然无虞的世界”，我们就可以获得自由。只有步出被人视之为理所当然的社会常规，我们才能够直面人的境遇而不必诉诸安慰人的神秘化的骗人把戏。\n自由以一定程度的意识解放为前提。无论我们有什么样的获得自由的可能性，倘若我们继续假定，“安然无虞的世界”是唯一可能的世界，那么自由就难以实现。社会给我们提供了温暖的、相当舒服的洞穴，我们可以和同伴蜷缩在洞穴里，给自己擂鼓壮胆，用鼓声淹没黑暗中传来的豺狼虎豹的嗥叫声，而“游离”是走出洞穴、独自面对黑夜的行动。\n\n\n社会学的人文性质\n在自由、真理的坚持不懈的学术传统中，社会学的人文冲动在当代情景中找到了自己的生存空间。社会学中的人文主义性质既体现“在我们如何看这个世界的过程中，也体现在这一学科所蕴含的道德诉求之中”。\n社会学既是方法论意义上的“科学”，又是人文关怀意义上的人文学科。社会学关心的首先是人的生存境遇，主张社会学向哲学和史学的人性关怀学习。在人的存在里，人的社会存在是关键的一维，因此社会学反复研究的根本问题是，人之为人有何意义，作为具体情景里的人又有何意义。\n对相对性和“选择”的体验不仅是一个普遍的历史现象，而且是每个人生活中真实的生存体验问题。社会学针对这种生存体验的社会根源提出的洞见可能会给我们一丝安慰，有助于我们为令人痛苦的问题寻找一个富有哲理的答案或神学意义上的解答。在这个启示稀缺、令人痛苦的世界里，即使对小小的恩赐，我们也要心存感激。\n社会学不是道德科学\n社会学家有道德关怀，但社会学不是“道德科学”。我们不能够接受或复活法国社会学由孔德提出、涂尔干继承的那种希望。社会科学不能够推导出一种客观的道德（所谓的“道德科学”，sciencedes moeurs），也无法在此基础上确立一种世俗的问答形式来表述客观的道德。\n在美国，社会学知识为政治宣传、军事规划服务的情况已经令人脊背发凉。在极权主义的社会里，社会学知识的应用可能会变成一场疆梦。社会学在当代工业管理、公共关系和广告里的应用也不是道德上的美景。许多社会学家并不认为这样的应用产生了道德上的问题，这个事实本身就足以证明，社会学视角本身不会使人具备道德上更高水平的敏锐性。\n\n\n社会学的马基雅维利主义\n马基雅维利主义是一种看问题的方式，本身在伦理上是中性的。而一旦它被毫无顾忌或缺乏同情心的人利用，它就带上了负面的伦理能量。弗里德里克.梅内克（Friedrich Meinecke）在他论政治马基雅维利主义的历史中阐明：从这位伟大的论国家的意大利诊断师的本意来看，国家理性（raison d'etat）本可以和最严肃的伦理关怀结合起来。\n社会学的马基雅维利主义也可以进行这样的结合。比如，马克斯·韦伯的生平就给人客观的教益，使我们看到无情的社会学知识可以和为实现道德理想而进行的小心求证结合起来。但这不能够改变马基雅维利思想被用作卑劣工具的可能性。\n如果可以把社会学家当作马基雅维利主义者，那么他的才能既可以为邪恶的事情服务，也可以为解放人的事业服务。社会学家是社会感知的“雇佣兵”。有些“雇佣兵”为压迫者卖命，另一些“雇佣兵”为解放者奋斗。\n对于被互相冲突的狂热撕裂的人而言，社会学家像马基雅维利主义者那样拉开距离看社会所作出的贡献并不是微不足道的。互相冲突的狂热有一个重要的共同点：它们有关社会性质的意识形态是浑浑噩噩的。以人的需求为动机，而不是以宏大的政治纲领为动机；有选择地、适度地奉献力量，而不是为极权主义的信仰去牺牲；既怀抱同情心又持怀疑态度；不抱偏见去谋求理解……所有这一切都是社会学在研究人的生存境遇时可以做到的。\n社会学的知识使人产生相当程度的清醒意识，这使保守运动和革命运动都遭遇风险：不具备现行意识形态必须要有的轻信态度使保守运动遭遇风险；对乌托邦神话持怀疑态度，而这些神话是培育革命者的必要条件，因此又使革命运动遭遇风险。\n清醒意识会让人不由自主地对社会作出激进的诊断，却又没有能力践行激进的政治责任，因而以受虐待狂的姿态去崇拜揭黑幕的人，此外无路可走。这种愤世嫉俗的态度本身是幼稚的，其根源常常是缺乏历史视野。人们可以轻信并顺从现存社会制度永恒的观念，可以轻信并期待即将来临的社会制度，愤世嫉俗的态度并非唯一的选择。\n人生如戏、如剧场、如舞台、如狂欢节，社会生存如两面神、如悲喜剧。在人生的社会游戏场里，我们可以将悲悯的情怀、适度的承诺和一定程度的喜剧意识结合起来，产生一种与社会相对的姿态，其基础是认为社会根本是一场喜剧。\n在这场喜剧里，人们纷纷登台亮相，身穿花哨的戏剧服装，变换头顶的帽子，改变自己的名号，用手里的棍子互相敲打，或者让同台亮相的演员相信，自己手里握有棍子。这种滑稽的视角并不忽视这样一个事实：实际上不存在的棍子也可以使人真的流血，但这样的事实不会使人把波将金的假村落当作上帝之城。除非游戏规则保护活生生的人，除非游戏规则培育真正的人的价值，否则就会拒绝认真对待游戏规则。由此可见，社会学里的马基雅维利主义和愤世嫉俗的机会主义是决然对立的，前者能够使自由在社会行动中得以实现。",

“社会”是动机和力量的世界，是不能用官方对社会现实的解释来理解的。例如，社会学家想要知道的是“非正式权力结构”（对此研究感兴趣的美国社会学家弗洛伊德·亨特所用的术语）的构成情况，这是由人及其权力组成的结构形态。\n\n\n社会学的视角\n社会学家的问题万变不离其宗：“人们如何互动？”“他们的关系如何？”“这些关系在机构里是如何组织的？”“推动人和机构的集体观念是什么？”\n社会学视角并不有助于我们产生登高望远的观点，而是在一定程度上对主日学校和公民教育里对社会现实的解释产生祛魅作用。\n社会学的视角使我们用新的目光去审视我们生活于其中的非常熟悉的世界。社会学家活动的领域是他熟悉的领域，在普通人的世界里游走，和大多数人称为真实的世界贴近。召唤他的还有另一种令人激动的发现——不是发现全然陌生的东西，而是发现熟悉的东西发生了意义上的变化。\n\n\n社会学的人性价值\n平民焦点：\n社会学方法中兴趣的平民焦点，即仔细研究其他学者可能认为平淡无奇、不值得作为科学研究对象的事情。人的一切所作所为都能够成为社会学研究的重要课题。\n善于倾听：\n社会学家需要仔细倾听他人的倾诉而不必提出自己的意见。倾听里至少潜藏着一定的人性化意义，因为在我们这个神经紧张、偏爱饶舌的时代里，几乎没有人愿意抽出时间去专心致志地倾听别人的意见。\n评价责任：\n社会学最后一个独特的人性价值是社会学家承担着对自己的发现作出评价的责任。在他心理上能够承担的范围内，他的评价不能顾及自己的偏见、好恶、希望或畏惧。\n\n\n社会学的意义\n社会学是非常具有现代性的、很合时宜的批判性思想形式。社会学的认识使我们对这样的社会观念机制持怀疑态度：社会把光明分配给一些人，把黑暗分配给另一些人（包括略微修补后把黑暗和“病态”画等号的现代机制）。\n社会学知识有利于培育这样的意识：所有人都在为自己的命运抗争；在属于自己的短暂的生命里，人的身份随时受到威胁，显得格外珍贵，人必须要为界定自己的身份而抗争。\n社会学最大的贡献在于，它有利于确立人的主体性，有助于人逃离社会的“监狱”、“陷阱”和“木偶操纵线”，鼓励人去追求自由。\n\n\n社会学意识的四个母题\n社会学意识的第一个母题是“揭露真相”。揭露真相是社会学的固有逻辑：社会学揭露真相的母题并不是心理学的母题，而是方法论的母题。社会学的参考框架有一个内置的方法论，社会学研究的现实的层次并非官方所解释的层次，它带有揭露真相的逻辑必然性，社会学有责任揭示人们用来掩盖互动的托词和宣传。这种揭露真相的责任是社会学的特点之一，它尤其精于把握当代社会的脾气。\n社会学家常用“意识形态”这个字眼来揭露既得利益群体使自己具有合法性的真相。“某一思想为社会上的某一既得利益服务时，我们就把这种思想称为意识形态”。意识形态经常地，即使不是一贯地、系统地扭曲社会现实，以便插足它能够插足的地方。社会学揭露真相的母题就是穿透言词的烟幕，深人到行为背后去发现人们不会承认的，而且常常使人不愉快的行为动机。\n社会学意识的第二个母题是“不恭敬的态度”。\n社会学意识里这种不敬的母题未必隐含着革命的态度。社会学的认识本身就敌视革命的意识形态，这并不是因为社会学有一种保守的偏向，而是因为它不仅看穿了对现状的幻灭感，而且看穿了对未来的虚幻的期待（虚幻的期待就是革命者习惯性的精神营养），因此具有一种非革命性的、温和的清醒意识。\n不敬的态度可以表现为情绪，也可以表现为意志，但无论其表现形式如何，不敬的态度始终应该是社会学家头脑里的一种可能性。这种态度可能会与他生活的其他方面隔离开来，也可能掩藏在日常的心态之下，甚至在意识形态上遭到否定。\n社会学意识的第三个母题是“中性化趋势”，第四个母题是“世界眼光”。\n社会学思想的实质接近于尼采所谓的“怀疑的艺术”。完全的思想尊敬必然意味着社会学的死亡。真正的社会学研究在极权主义的国家很快就消失得无影无踪，纳粹德国就是很好的例子。\n社会学的认识有一个隐含的意义：对警察和其他公共秩序的守护者的头脑而言，它始终是一个潜在的危险，因为它总是倾向于使绝对正确的断言中性化，而警察等守护者的头脑总是以这样的断言为依托。\n社会学代表的意识是价值完全中性化了的世界的意识。现代社会的地理流动和社会流动速度前所未有，因而自己的文化，包括基本的价值观在时间和空间上都只具有相对性。\n\n\n社会学对自我的微观分析\n“过去是可变的、易变的、不断变化的，这是因为我们回忆过去的经历时往往反复进行新的解释。所以我们说，一个人有多少观点，他就有多少不同的人生经历。”\n从社会学的角度来看，自我不再是铁板一块，不再是从一个情景过渡到另一个情景的既定实体。更加准确地说，自我是一个过程，不断被创造和再创造的过程，人进人每一个社会情景时自我都要发生变化，自我靠纤细的记忆之绳串联在一起。\n\n\n人在社会——社会决定论的几个主题\n“自我”的社会定位、社会控制机制、社会分层、社会情景和制度\n（1）“自我”的社会定位\n如果我们接受涂尔干的观点，那么社会就是横亘在我们面前的客观实在。社会就在那里，不能否认，必须面对。社会外在于我们，包围我们，涵盖我们生活的一切方面。我们生活在社会中，定位于社会体系的某些具体部分。我们的定位几乎预先决定和界定了我们所做的一切：从语言到礼仪，从宗教信仰到自杀的可能性。在社会定位上，社会不考虑我们的愿望。我们从精神上对社会规定和禁令的反抗会于事无补，而且常常是徒劳无益的。社会是客观和外在的事实，特别以压制的形式面对我们。社会制度形塑我们的行为，甚至塑造我们的期望。\n社会是一个历史实体，在时间上它超越了任何个人的生命历程。社会走在我们身前，存在于我们身后。我们出生之前，社会已然存在，我们去世之后它将继续存在。我们的生命只不过是漫长岁月里社会宏伟征途中短暂的插曲而已。社会是让我们身陷囹圄的历史囚笼。\n（2）群体动力学原理\n求得共识的压力难以避免，人极其渴望被群体接受，无论周围的群体是什么样的群体。这种欲望可以很有效地被操纵，群体治疗师、蛊惑人心者和其他实施共识工程（consensus engineering）的专门化人才就善于操纵人的欲望。\n（3）社会行为与社会现实\n韦伯强调社会行为的意图，涂尔干对社会行为的意图则缺乏兴趣。涂尔干强调社会现实的外在性、客观性，强调社会现实状若“事物”的性质 （“本质”quiddity）。韦伯的主张与此对立，强调主观的意义、意图和解释，这些是行为者参与社会情景时带进来的东西。韦伯同时指出，社会中最终发生的事情可能和行为者的意图截然不同。然而他断言，必须要考虑主观这个维度的全貌，才能够获得充分的社会学知识（verstehen，文化知解法）——社会学知识要对社会里存在的意义作出解释。\n涂尔干和韦伯看社会的方式并不是逻辑上矛盾的方式。它们只不过是对立的表述而已，因为它们集中关注的是社会现实的不同方面。社会是客观事实，社会压制甚至制造我们一这样说是完全正确的。但我们有意义的行为支撑着社会大厦，有时还协助改变社会大厦——这样说也是正确的。\n实际上，这两句话包含了社会存在的悖论：社会界定我们，又反过来被我们界定。我们与社会合作、共谋。然而，一旦我们用合作、共谋的观点看社会，而不是用被社会压制和制造的观点来看社会，社会看起来就很脆弱。我们要生存下去就需要得到社会的承认，以此获得自我形象和身份；社会也需要得到许多像我们一样的普通人的承认，否则它就不能存在。\n\n\n社会在人——角色理论、知识社会学、参照群体理论\n（1）角色理论与游戏社会\n角色理论认为，人的身份是被动接受的，不是主动选择的。从社会学的视角看，身份是社会赋予，并由社会支撑和转换的。\n米德认为，社会角色是通过游戏学会的。如果整个社会不具备人为的性质，社交的人为性就不可能成立。社交就是“游戏社会” （playing society）的一种特殊情况，游戏者对其虚构性更加自觉。而社交也是更为宏大的社会结构的一部分，你同样能够与之游戏。通过这样的游戏，儿童学会了扮演“认真”的角色。在社交的过程中，我们在有些时刻回到了童年时代戴着面具的游戏生活里，这也许就是社交的乐趣。\n齐美尔的社交理论认为，社交是社会互动的游戏形式，游戏可以作为减轻压力的手段。此外，赫伊津哈把游戏作为人和社会的本质特征，对游戏的定位如下：“除非把人当作游戏的物种,除非研究人游戏和游乐的一面,否则我们就不可能把握人类文化”。\n（2）知识社会学\n在围绕世界观的大辩论中，社会学提出“谁说的？”这样一个恼人的问题。知识社会学回答“谁说的？”这个问题，试图清理从思想到思想者再到他所处的社会环境的发展脉络”。\n社会学视角引进了一丝令人清醒的怀疑要素，这种怀疑态度立竿见影，给人提供保护，使人不至于立即改变自己的信仰。社会学意识的参考框架使人能够以这样的态度去感受自己的经历：人的生活阅历是在若干具体的社会环境里流动的，所有的社会环境都附带着具体的意义体系。这样的社会学意识当然不能够解决何为真理的问题，但它使我们不那么容易掉进人生旅途中遭遇的每一个传教团设置的陷阱。\n（3）参照群体理论\n如果说知识社会学赋予我们构建社会现实的广阔视野，那么参照群体理论就向我们展示许多小作坊，其中那些构建世界的小群体就在锻造他们心中的宇宙模型。\n这个过程中隐蔽的社会心理动力学大概和角色理论的社会心理动力学大同小异。这样的社会心理动力大概是一种原始的欲望：被人接受、有一定归属并与人共同生活在一个世界里。\n\n\n社会学与人的自由\n按照盖伦的制度理论的解释，制度疏导人的行为颇似本能疏导动物的行为。而两者之间存在着一个重大的差异：倘若动物能够反思自己的本能，它一定会说，“我别无选择”；同样，在解释自己为何服从制度的要求时，人们也会说，“我别无选择”。唯一的区别是，动物说的是实情，人却是在欺骗自己。\n因为实际上人能够对社会说“不”，而倘若他们采取这样的行动，他们可能就会遭遇令人不快的后果。人们甚至想都不去想把“不”付诸行动，因为他们把服从视为理所当然。他们在制度里生存的性质也许是他们唯一敢于想象的身份，其他的选择似乎是发疯。而这并不改变一个事实：“我必须”几乎在每一个社会情景里都是欺骗自己的谎言。\n人的“监狱”、“囚笼”、“枷锁”是自己和社会共同打造的。社会“是‘存在于内心’的现象，社会是在我们心灵最深处存在的一部分……只有理解了内化机制以后，我们才能够理解这个令人难以置信的事实：社会不仅控制着我们的行为，而且塑造着我们的身份、思想和情感。社会的结构成为我们意识的结构。我们受制于社会的枷锁，这个枷锁不是我们被征服后套在我们身上的，而是我们和社会合谋打造的。大多数时候，我们是被自己身上的社会性推入陷阱的。我们来到人世之前，禁锢我们的围墙就已经修好了，但却由我们自己来进行重建。我们与社会的合作就是对自己的背叛，我们自己纵身跳进了社会的陷阱。”\n我们看见木偶在小小的剧场里手舞足蹈，任随木偶线的操纵而上上下下，严格按照小小的角色规定进行表演。我们学会了理解木偶剧场的逻辑，发现自己在追随木偶的表演。在社会生活里，我们也被吊挂在操纵我们的“木偶线”上，我们借此给自己定位，并承认自己的定位。在一刹那间，我们觉得自己很像是木偶。不过随后，我们就捕捉住了木偶剧场和人生戏剧的深刻区别：我们可以停止木偶的演出动作，抬头仰望并感知操纵我们的那一套“木偶线”。这个停止演出的动作是我们走向自由的第一步。\n社会学框架本身不能验证自由。如果我们想要把自己的论述严格限定在社会学的参考框架里，我们根本就无法探讨自由，因为社会学的参考框架是一个科学的框架。效用和美不同，但不矛盾，效用话语和审美话语这两个世界严格地说是不能比较、不可通约的。同理，自由和因果关系（科学框架）并不矛盾，两者仅仅是不同的术语而已。\n萨特认为，人不但是自由的，而且“注定是自由的”（condemned to freedom）。有人借口“身不由己”、“不得已而为之”，其实是放弃了自由的选择，是逃避自由（弗洛姆），这就是“自欺”。所谓“自欺”就是把事实上自愿的行为假装成必需的行为。“自欺”就是逃离自由，就是不诚实地逃避“选择的痛苦”（agony of choice）。\n反犹主义（或任何其他形式的种族主义或狂热的民族主义）本质上是“自欺”的，因为它把人的全部属性等同于社会属性。于是，人性就成了没有自由的实实在在的东西。人们的爱恨杀戮都局限于一个神话世界里：在这个世界里人人都成了社会标签，比如纳粹冲锋队员就成了自己的徽章所示的符号，犹太人就成了集中营囚服上标记的深受鄙视的符号。\n海德格尔有关“人”的观念说明：如果在泛化的“人”中失去自我，那就是不自由。“这个观念与他探讨本真和非本真的观念有关联。所谓本真的存在就是生活在这样一种清醒的意识中：个人的个性是独一无二、不可替代、无与伦比的特性。与此相比，非本真的存在就是在匿名的‘人’中失去自我，就是把自己独一无二的特性拱手出让给社会构建的抽象概念。”\n海德格尔“人”的观念和我们的社会观的相关性，与其说表现在其规定性意义上，不如说表现在认知性意义上。在论述人的“自欺”意义时，我们把社会当作给人提供逃避自由的借口的机制；在说到海德格尔“人”的观念时，我们把社会当作防御恐惧的机制。\n社会为我们提供了被我们视之为理所当然的结构（ “安然无虞的世界”），社会是产生非本真存在的共谋。在这些结构里，只要我们遵守规则，我们就能够得到保护，就不至于受到生存境遇终极恐惧的威胁。\n波将金（Grigori Aleksandrovich Potemkin）据说为了取悦卡捷琳娜二世而在她巡游的沿途搭建外观悦目的假村庄，社会的墙壁正是竖立在深渊边缘的波将金的村庄 （Potemkin's village）。墙壁的功能是保护我们，使我们不受惊吓，为我们组织一个有意义的世界，使我们在这个世界里的生命有意义。\n而一切制度结构都必然依赖欺骗，社会上的一切存在物都带有一点自欺的成分。这个闪光的洞见乍一看令人十分压抑，但它实际上使我们管窥到另一个观点：社会的决定力量并不像我们所料的那样强大，我们依然可以寻求一种本真的生存，但本真的生存同样只能在社会里发生，一切意义都是在社会里传递的。一切通向思考存在的路径都有其社会定位——宗教、哲学、美学的路径都有其社会定位。社会既可能是逃避自由的借口，也可能是获得自由的机缘；同理，社会既可以埋葬我们的形而上求索，也可以提供形而上求索的形式。在这里，我们再次遭遇我们社会生存的无处不在的两面神悖论——社会生存既自由又不自由。社会为大多数人提供的是借口和波将金的村庄，作为自由之路的功能只为少数人开放。即使我们认为社会里的本真是可能的，大多数人也并没有利用这个可能性。\n\n\n社会暴政的逃生隧道：变革、超然和巧妙利用\n变革与神授魅力\n社会变革和革命可以推翻社会压力。一切变革都是先内后外的，内心的变革走在社会变革之前，内心的变革就是自由：“实际上，我们审视革命时发现，总是在反抗旧秩序的外在行为出现之前，内在的顺从和忠诚就已经瓦解了....早在社会制度被暴力推翻之前，已经由于人民的鄙视而失去了意识形态的支持。不承认社会规范、反对社会规范的定义总是具有潜在的革命威力。”\n“神授魅力（Charisma）对预先界定的力量构成最富有激情的挑战。它用新的意义取代旧的意义，以激进的方式重新界定关于人的存在的预设”。而在神授魅力运动中表现出来的超乎寻常的激情很难能超过一代人的岁月。神授魅力必然走进一个韦伯所谓的“常规化”过程。它会以不那么激进的形式重新整合进社会结构里。先知的后继者是教皇，革命者的后继者是行政官员。宗教革命或政治革命的大地震过去之后，人们在自己认为的新秩序里安顿下来生活，而结果必然证明，变革并不像起初看起来的那样彻底。造反的狂热冷却之后，经济利益和政治雄心就取而代之。旧习惯重新抬头，由神授魅力推动的革命产生的新秩序开始复旧，和其用强大暴力推翻的社会及政治制度表现出令人不安的相似性。\n超然与自我流放\n超然的态度可以减轻社会压力：倘若不能改变或破坏社会，可以在内心深处采取退让的姿态。超然的态度是抵抗社会控制的办法，这样的处事态度始于老子，斯多葛派把它发展成为一个抵抗的学说。超然的处事者退出社会舞台，隐居到自己的宗教、思想和艺术领域里，进入自我流放的境界，形成“亚文化”和“反社会”等圈子。\n巧妙利用与游离\n逃避社会暴政的第三种方法是“巧妙利用”。所谓巧妙利用，就是用正常运转之外的方式去利用社会制度。运用这种方法时，个人并不尝试去改变社会结构，也不对社会结构采取超然的态度。相反，他用社会结构的合法守护者未曾预料到的方式去有意识地利用这些社会结构，根据他自己的目的在社会丛莽中独辟蹊径。欧文.戈夫曼分析了“囚徒”（inmates）世界（包括精神病院、监狱和其他压迫机构），他提供的例子充分说明“巧妙利用制度”（work thesystem）为何能够成立。\n在这里，游离（ecstasy）是一个有用的概念。所谓的“游离”不是神秘而异常的意识高涨，而是其字面的意思——置身局外或步出理所当然的日常社会时的那种感觉，与自己的世界拉开距离。\n一旦个人不必用内心的投人去扮演角色时，一旦他刻意和假装扮演角色而不必内心投人时，扮演者就进人了“游离”的境界，就忘记了“理所当然的世界”。别人认为是命运使然，他却认为只是一套需要考虑的因素；别人认为是重要的身份，他却当作方便的伪装。“游离”改变了他的社会意识，以至于既定性（givenness）变成了可能性（possibility）。\n“游离”既有社会学的意义，也有形而上的意义。如果我们以“游离”的姿态走出“理所当然的世界”和“安然无虞的世界”，我们就可以获得自由。只有步出被人视之为理所当然的社会常规，我们才能够直面人的境遇而不必诉诸安慰人的神秘化的骗人把戏。\n自由以一定程度的意识解放为前提。无论我们有什么样的获得自由的可能性，倘若我们继续假定，“安然无虞的世界”是唯一可能的世界，那么自由就难以实现。社会给我们提供了温暖的、相当舒服的洞穴，我们可以和同伴蜷缩在洞穴里，给自己擂鼓壮胆，用鼓声淹没黑暗中传来的豺狼虎豹的嗥叫声，而“游离”是走出洞穴、独自面对黑夜的行动。\n\n\n社会学的人文性质\n在自由、真理的坚持不懈的学术传统中，社会学的人文冲动在当代情景中找到了自己的生存空间。社会学中的人文主义性质既体现“在我们如何看这个世界的过程中，也体现在这一学科所蕴含的道德诉求之中”。\n社会学既是方法论意义上的“科学”，又是人文关怀意义上的人文学科。社会学关心的首先是人的生存境遇，主张社会学向哲学和史学的人性关怀学习。在人的存在里，人的社会存在是关键的一维，因此社会学反复研究的根本问题是，人之为人有何意义，作为具体情景里的人又有何意义。\n对相对性和“选择”的体验不仅是一个普遍的历史现象，而且是每个人生活中真实的生存体验问题。社会学针对这种生存体验的社会根源提出的洞见可能会给我们一丝安慰，有助于我们为令人痛苦的问题寻找一个富有哲理的答案或神学意义上的解答。在这个启示稀缺、令人痛苦的世界里，即使对小小的恩赐，我们也要心存感激。\n社会学不是道德科学\n社会学家有道德关怀，但社会学不是“道德科学”。我们不能够接受或复活法国社会学由孔德提出、涂尔干继承的那种希望。社会科学不能够推导出一种客观的道德（所谓的“道德科学”，sciencedes moeurs），也无法在此基础上确立一种世俗的问答形式来表述客观的道德。\n在美国，社会学知识为政治宣传、军事规划服务的情况已经令人脊背发凉。在极权主义的社会里，社会学知识的应用可能会变成一场疆梦。社会学在当代工业管理、公共关系和广告里的应用也不是道德上的美景。许多社会学家并不认为这样的应用产生了道德上的问题，这个事实本身就足以证明，社会学视角本身不会使人具备道德上更高水平的敏锐性。\n\n\n社会学的马基雅维利主义\n马基雅维利主义是一种看问题的方式，本身在伦理上是中性的。而一旦它被毫无顾忌或缺乏同情心的人利用，它就带上了负面的伦理能量。弗里德里克.梅内克（Friedrich Meinecke）在他论政治马基雅维利主义的历史中阐明：从这位伟大的论国家的意大利诊断师的本意来看，国家理性（raison d'etat）本可以和最严肃的伦理关怀结合起来。\n社会学的马基雅维利主义也可以进行这样的结合。比如，马克斯·韦伯的生平就给人客观的教益，使我们看到无情的社会学知识可以和为实现道德理想而进行的小心求证结合起来。但这不能够改变马基雅维利思想被用作卑劣工具的可能性。\n如果可以把社会学家当作马基雅维利主义者，那么他的才能既可以为邪恶的事情服务，也可以为解放人的事业服务。社会学家是社会感知的“雇佣兵”。有些“雇佣兵”为压迫者卖命，另一些“雇佣兵”为解放者奋斗。\n对于被互相冲突的狂热撕裂的人而言，社会学家像马基雅维利主义者那样拉开距离看社会所作出的贡献并不是微不足道的。互相冲突的狂热有一个重要的共同点：它们有关社会性质的意识形态是浑浑噩噩的。以人的需求为动机，而不是以宏大的政治纲领为动机；有选择地、适度地奉献力量，而不是为极权主义的信仰去牺牲；既怀抱同情心又持怀疑态度；不抱偏见去谋求理解……所有这一切都是社会学在研究人的生存境遇时可以做到的。\n社会学的知识使人产生相当程度的清醒意识，这使保守运动和革命运动都遭遇风险：不具备现行意识形态必须要有的轻信态度使保守运动遭遇风险；对乌托邦神话持怀疑态度，而这些神话是培育革命者的必要条件，因此又使革命运动遭遇风险。\n清醒意识会让人不由自主地对社会作出激进的诊断，却又没有能力践行激进的政治责任，因而以受虐待狂的姿态去崇拜揭黑幕的人，此外无路可走。这种愤世嫉俗的态度本身是幼稚的，其根源常常是缺乏历史视野。人们可以轻信并顺从现存社会制度永恒的观念，可以轻信并期待即将来临的社会制度，愤世嫉俗的态度并非唯一的选择。\n人生如戏、如剧场、如舞台、如狂欢节，社会生存如两面神、如悲喜剧。在人生的社会游戏场里，我们可以将悲悯的情怀、适度的承诺和一定程度的喜剧意识结合起来，产生一种与社会相对的姿态，其基础是认为社会根本是一场喜剧。\n在这场喜剧里，人们纷纷登台亮相，身穿花哨的戏剧服装，变换头顶的帽子，改变自己的名号，用手里的棍子互相敲打，或者让同台亮相的演员相信，自己手里握有棍子。这种滑稽的视角并不忽视这样一个事实：实际上不存在的棍子也可以使人真的流血，但这样的事实不会使人把波将金的假村落当作上帝之城。除非游戏规则保护活生生的人，除非游戏规则培育真正的人的价值，否则就会拒绝认真对待游戏规则。由此可见，社会学里的马基雅维利主义和愤世嫉俗的机会主义是决然对立的，前者能够使自由在社会行动中得以实现。",
